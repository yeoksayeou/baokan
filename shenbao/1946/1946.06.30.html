<h3>停戰期限今午屆滿　主席將頒重要文告　三人會今上午開會作最後決定　馬徐周或將偕飛東北</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三十日晨三時電〕聞明晨蔣主席將　和平談判結果，頒佈重要文吿。又蔣主席於今晚七時許，在軍校官邸邀集白崇禧，陳誠，徐永昌，兪大維，王世杰，部力子，張勵生等政府諸要員聚餐。聞主席於聽取各方報吿後，與諸委員對當前之局勢有所商討。今夜最後消息，軍事三人會定明日上午開會，對東北停戰，恢復交通，整編統編軍隊，馬使公斷權，作最後決定，如不能全部簽訂協議，亦將就已決定之部份簽字，並由雙方發表公吿，局勢業由蔣主席忍讓爲國之苦心而趨好轉。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕中央宜傳部準備於明日停戰限期最後之一小時或逾限後之二小時內，發布東要公吿，此項公吿之內容，可能爲全面和平之前奏曲，或者是全面和平之預約券，抑或爲局部和平之議定書，並視今日午夜以後十小時內中共之態度以爲斷。據今晚中宣部許副部長笑語本報記者去：今夜請記者們放心睡覺，明日請來聽取好消息，明日星期例假，中宣部仍照常辦公。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕第三次之停戰限期至明日中午止，又吿滿期，但截至今晚十一時，整軍方案中之局部問題，仍未談妥。聞今晨十時，交長　大維，曾訪晤馬歇爾持使，談約僅二十分鐘即辭出。馬使旋於上午十一時携同渠昨夜修正補充之整軍方案的過渡辦法，及中共對該案補充之意見，晋謁主席，懇談兩小時，於午後一時始返回官邸。柯克上校亦於上午十一時訪問周恩來，商談一小時，周氏與柯克會談後，即於下午二時，忽忽赴馬歇爾行館，聽取馬使上午與主席會談之結果，考慮接受馬使勸吿，迅速就整軍問題開誠與政府協商，以便續開軍事三人會議，聞商談至六時半，尙未獲得切實之結果。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕據悉：馬使所提折衷案，如獲得雙方同意簽字，軍事三人會之馬徐周可能聯袂飛往東北，促成東北國境內全面停戰，以使協商。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕據中共方而自稱：中共在整軍一項內，已作如下讓步：（一）中共對軍隊的比例問題，業已放棄要求；（二）哈爾濱的現狀，可以給予政府很大的「優勢」；（三）熱河，察哈爾，蘇北地區之中共駐軍，在點可以盡量讓步。以上意見，即本日下午周恩來與馬歇爾商談四小時許之內容。馬帥原定今晚往謁主席，唯以紀録尚未譯竣而作罷，明晨當可見面晤談。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕聞政府所提整軍方案之對案，關於蘇北（包括皖北在內）熱河，東北，山東部份，希望中共能全部撤退，案即政府根據各地人民要求始終堅持之防區制。據邵力子自蔣主席官邸返出時表示，此中大部份問題已獲協議，現僅餘關內部份尙待商談。</p>
<p>折衷方案內容</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕今日政府及中共竟日研討昨日馬使提出之整軍折衷方案中之過渡辦法。聞此一辦法，已採納中共方面若干意見，此一方案如能於今夜十二時前獲得協議，可望於停戰期最後之六小時內重開三人會議，並於會議結束時由雙方簽字，立刻發表公報。唯該項辦法，政府方面頗多碍難接受之處，現正在作最後考慮中。茲略舉馬使所擬之听衷方案過　辦法內容要點如次：</p>
<p>（一）關於駐地問題，雙方軍隊均應恢復六月七日東北停戰令頒佈以前之態勢；（二）政府方面和平接收哈爾濱齊齊哈爾（一說中共暫不退出齊齊哈爾）安東三大城，僅限於行政，於行政人員前往接收時，中共軍隊應撤退至離城三十里或五十里以外之地區；（三）凡駐紮於各大鐵路綫上之雙方軍隊，為避免衝突及恢復交通計，均應各撤退至若干指定之地區；（四）雙方軍隊應　速整編統編，俾節省開支，並不得擅自徵兵或擴充部隊；（五）整編後之軍隊，一律爲中華民國之國軍，享受國軍之一切待遇；（六）一切黨團均應退出軍隊，獲得協議後，即由國共正式簽字，下令全國停戰，並迅速恢復全國交通；（七）一俟軍事間題得具體之結果後，即實施改組國民政府及開國民大會，制定憲法，實施憲政，達成「軍隊國家化」，「政治民主化」。但此一方案當事三方均未能予以證實，係由接近某方之人士片面傳出，並聞中共對此一過渡辦法，已表示同意，因上述辦法對中共極爲有利也。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿九日電〕大剛報今日載稱；馬歇爾之整軍折衷方案，中共對其建議各點已表贊同，政府則仍堅持共軍應撤出山東各口岸，熱河及察哈爾各主要城市及鐵路，以及皖北蘇北。據中共方面會稱：共軍要以自上述地區中之一部份退出，但政府不得取消中共在各該地區所建立之政治系統，經濟計劃及其他各項政策。</p>
<h3>京中各方面人士　昨接觸頻繁　郡力子王世杰謁主席　並與莫德惠等作商談</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕今爲和平談判最緊張之一日，各方面接觸頻繁，顯示談判已至最後關頭。上午九時政府代表邵力子，應梁漱溟，黃炎培遇同訪王世杰商談，同時民盟之張君勱，羅隆基趨訪馬特使。下午四時邵力子當震假國大會當舉行茶會，約請社會賢達靑年黨，民主同盟三方面代表，交換對當前時局意見。各方代表以停戰期限瞬將屆滿，在此短促之時間內，僉盼各項問題可獲協議，並期以最大之努力，使眞正之和平得以實現。茶會中，首由邵力子報吿最近商談情形，梁漱溟，張君勱，羅隆基繼之分別報吿與周恩來談話及訪晤馬帥經過，各代表咸盼知悉今日商談詳情，當由曾琦等建議，推梁漱溟，莫德惠等代表，於八時半往訪周恩來，同時請邵力子，王世杰謁見蔣主席，報吿談判情形，並陳述三方面代表意見，十時，各方面代表復約集於英德惠寓邸，請邵力子等報吿政府及中共意旨，並交換意見。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕邵力子，王世杰兩氏，於今晚八時往謁主席後，復於十一時赴莫德惠處，有所會談，據邵氏稱：全國人士所關心之和戰問題，可正吿記者：「明日決不會打」·至於目前未決之問題，祗剩整軍駐地之關內部份未獲協議，然大部份問題均已獲得解決，但政府仍續作最後最大之讓步。</p>
<h3>國防部新聞局　正式開始辦公</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕國防部新聞局已正式開始辦公，聞各軍師政治部改爲新聞處後，均隸屬各級部隊參謀長，列爲軍隊幕僚機構，其地位則同於客卿，其任務則首在推進軍中文化。</p>
<h3>國大在京代表　發表時局宣言　主張請政府制裁內亂</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕「償理社〕訊：國內局勢，因中共一再拖延，毫無悔禍誠意，又復鼓動無知羣衆，倡言反美，本日已届停戰期滿關頭，談判仍無具體結果，頃國民大會在京代表集議，對時局發表嚴正宣言，題爲我們對當前時局之意見，由綏遠代表祁器　，檀香山僑民代表沈靈修等領銜發表，聯署者六十餘人，主張請政府制裁內亂，並向蘇聯抗議其助長內亂行爲。又據國大代表鄧公玄。鄭湘疇等吿記者，謂此項署名之意見，各同人自信均爲國民心中所欲言，決無黨派私見。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿九日電〕杭市十餘文化團體，廿九日共同對時局發表宜言，內有「中共是不要中華民國的，祗有其社會主義的「祖國」，中共革命了二十多年，發覺此路不通，於是轉灣抹角，說共產革命是最高的目標，民主革命是最低的目標，中共的殺人放火，攻城略地，以至賣國作漢奸，無不有一套理論，有朝一日國亡種絕，中共還要說「爲世界革命，這種犧牲是値得的！」一國民黨不是沒有缺點，但是和平統一民主的障礙，在於中共等云云」，又此間正報今日社論，以僅餘之卅六小時爲題，指責中共之整軍對案爲一空洞而又不着邊際之對案，並呼籲全國同胞及第三方面人士，應本公平合理之判斷，提出嚴厲之主張。</p>
<p>〔中央社成都廿八日電〕川省參議會頃上蔣主席一電，大意如下：中共違紀背信，叛亂稱戈，旣拆毁交通，以阻復員，復陰謀割據，而破壞統一，此次鈞痙明令停戰延期，足示企求和平之殷切，乃中共仍反復無常，迄無悔意，烽火漫延，全國爲之騷亂，友邦爲之憂慮，本會目擊大勢，憂慮無已，深知八年血戰，方收勝利之功，再事退忍，必致毁滅之禍，爰經大會議決，於此次停戰延期届滿之後，苟中共仍陽奉陰違，罔顧國運，即懇鈞座，乾綱立斷，戡平內亂，以解人民倒懸，永奠和平，而維國家根本，屬會謹代表七千萬人民督爲政府後盾。</p>

<h3>關內外人心不定中　三小組出發調處　昨分赴青島及雙城洮安</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕今日北方天氣陰沈悶熱，停戰時限已近，而報載南京談判距離仍遠，影響人心不安，然關內外則有三個小組，於今晨起赴任所，其一爲由平出發之新派之靑烏小組，調處靑島附近衝突，另二小組卅五、卅六，係由長春出發，一赴哈爾濱南之雙城縣，一赴嫩江省之洮安，（白城子），原來軍調部東北前進指揮所政府方面要求派二小組分赴哈爾濱與齊齊哈爾，共方不同意，迨蔡文治隨何應欽到長，美方折衷提議，改派往雙城洮安，乃吿決定。</p>

<h3>艾克遜發表聲明　解釋美助華政策　目的在造成中國之統一</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿八日電〕代理國務　艾克遜本日在招待記者會中：關於美國　華協助問題，發表聲明如下：最近中國方而報紙所載之消息，顯示中國若干份子對於吾人協助中國之目標與政策。不無誤會或曲解之處。美政府爲協助小國而採取之各項行動，僅爲完成援華計劃之步驟，此種計劃早經同意，其目的爲協助整個中國消除對日長期戰爭所引起之種種影響，此等步驟不能解釋爲支持中國國內任何黨派之軍事集團，吾人之行動非短期內能完全實現，其目標爲造成而非破壞中國之統一，爲鼓勵中國人士以和平協定之民主方法，解决其國內種種問題，而不訴諸武力。關於此點，吾人不妨引證一九四五年十二月十五日總統對華政策之公開聲明，總統稱：當中國向和平與統一邁進之時，美國將準備在各種合理之範圍內協助國民政府重建中國，改進農業與工業之經濟，並建立强大之軍事機構，俾中國能對國內及國際盡其維持和平與秩序之責任。</p>
<p>助華編練　現代陸軍</p>
<p>目下國會內有一議案，即爲協助中國政府編成一個數量適中之現代陸軍。此一立法主要目標之一，爲予中國以實際上之協助，履行本年二月廿五日在重慶所訂關於改編及統一中國武裝部隊之協定。此一協定規定由現有之中共軍與中央軍內抽編而成一個非政治之國民軍。對華協助之不少描施，須貴相當時日以便進行談判，協定，立法行動，而最後又須由總統根據當時之情形，加以决定。</p>
<p>解救中國　經濟危機</p>
<p>上述各項步　勢須曠日持久，例如刻在國會討論中之對華軍事援助法案，需時富在一年以上，且如於任何特殊階段遭逢障故，恐將遇重大困難万能繼續。最近對華之油管祖借協定，頗引起一般人之汪意，此項協定總額約五千八百萬美金，此一協定事實上爲日本投降後不久本國與中國所獲諒解之正式手續而巳，其時的定中國得購買已在製造中或啓運赴華之租備物資，以物資及貸款形式，　予中國經濟援助之種種措施，乃美國設法解救中國嚴重經濟危機，及防止財政與經濟崩潰之公正努力。本國政府因希望吾人所提供之經濟援助，能由一充分及公平代表中國各重要政治黨派（包括共黨在內）之政府主持分配。本國政府感覺不應在中國各政黨在一統一政府之下携手合作之前，暫緩實行經濟援助。吾人如幷此種最低限度之經濟援助亦吝而不予，結果或將召致經濟崩潰之危機，而陷中國一般人民於永深火熱之中。</p>

<h3>經部計劃委會將開會　討論五重要問題　並將分設小組經常研究經濟</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕經濟部計劃委員會首届會議業已決定自七月一日下午開始，五日下午止，每日上下午會議二次，共計九次，議程排定第一二兩次會議討論三十六年度經濟部施政綱領，第三次會議討論挽救工業危機，第四五兩次會　討論經濟決令與經濟行政之檢討，第六七兩次會議物價問頭，第八决會議討論國營與民營事業之配合發展，第九次會議討論改進國際貿易之設施。届時蔣主席將親臨致訓。</p>

<h3>社論　特港問題的重要性</h3>
<p>四强外長會議重開以來，瞬逾兼旬，但會議依舊沒有什麼進展。雖其間曾獲數項協議，如杜特坎尼斯羣島歸還希臘等等，然而歐洲和會的召開，依舊因爲對於和約的若干主要點迄未成立協議，前途似愈覺暗澹。在這些和約的主要點中，土地的再分割或轉讓，自然是一個極重要的關鍵。兩决外長會議的召開，兩决爲了外長會議而召開的次官會議，對於這些領土問題的解决，依舊存有極大的距離。不將這些領土問題獲致協議，幾乎無法成立和約，無法召開歐洲和會的。在關於這些領土的再劃分的問題中，其中一個最重要的，就是特里埃斯特港口問題。這問題不但迄未成立任何協議，而且就現有的跡象言，四强間的意見，距離愈來愈遠，儼然成爲四强外長會議的主要爭執，可見其關係之重要。</p>
<p>特里埃斯特，是亞德里海北岸的一個港口，第一次大戰前本屬於奧匈帝國，爲奧匈帝國海軍的一個重要基地。其地居民，本以義大利人占多數，因爲是奧匈帝國的一個重要海口，所以當一八五〇年後，北義大利的薩華王朝崛起，力圖統一，奧匈帝國在北義大利開始撤退的時候，它却不主張將這個重要海口也歸還給義大利。義大利的民族主義份子對此原早表不滿。直到第一决世界大戰奧匈帝國顚覆以外，纔收回了特里埃斯特及其附近一帶土地而遂其義大利民族運動的宿願。不料特里埃斯特歸義還不到三十年，而義大利因墨索里尼的誤國，在第二次世界大戰中遭到了慘敗，同時義大利的鄰邦南斯拉夫，在狄托元帥之下，却投入了蘇聯的懷抱，南斯拉夫遂藉口有少數南斯拉夫人居留在特港及其附近一帶地，要求將特港劃歸南斯拉夫。這要求，立刻得到蘇聯的支持。在英美，爲了維護義大利人的民族願望，對特港的劃歸南斯拉夫，自然堅决反對。爲了表示互相讓步，一方提出新建議，主張特港國際化，歸聯合國管理十年，再由當地居民投票表决，這已遭到蘇聯的反對。而蘇聯所提出的新建議，主張義南兩國共有特港，各委總督一人，實行共管，一面盟方應承認特港以西之義南新國界。這據莫洛托夫的表示，乃是蘇聯的「絕大讓步」，然而這新建議却遭到美國務卿貝爾納斯的明白反對。四强外長會議召開了兩决，對於這個特港問題的一隅之爭，尙且不能成立協議，可知外長會議的前途暗礁重重，膽望歐洲和會及世界和平的前途，令人惶惑不安。</p>
<p>特港問題所爭執的土地面積雖不大，然而這是歐洲和平的一個重要關鍵；甚至也可說是世界和平重要關鍵的一環。如能對此問題成立協議，其它問題不難解决。這問題的核心是：如果英美存心要阻遏蘇聯勢力的再擴張，則特港及其附近一帶土地，它們自不願接納蘇聯的建議，劃歸南斯拉夫或義南共有；如果英美對蘇聯要採取綏靖政策，則特港問題便不難解決。特港是西歐的門戶，如果特港劃歸南斯拉夫，而南斯拉夫又是蘇聯的附庸，則蘇聯的勢力一直可以伸到西歐的大門內了。由於法義兩國總選的結果，英美當局目前似覺更有負起阻止蘇聯勢力再擴張的義務。但同時，另一方面，蘇聯鑒於法義兩國民意的趨向，也更加强它對於武力的信任，使它的態度轉趨於堅强，使它在歐陸的占領軍在和約未成以前得以長期占領下去。特港至少在目前，幾乎是一個必爭的問題了。上次巴黎外長會議時，美國代表團在貝爾納斯堅持之下，已有巴黎不啻「慕尼黑第二」之呼聲，而美國共和黨健將范登堡明白地說大家不肯再做慕尼黑時代的張伯倫。即此可見雙方爭執已經到了如何白熱化的程度了。</p>
<p>特港是一個小問題，然而背面所蘊藏的却具有極大的意義。這是一個霸力政治與民主政治的問題。人類在經過了兩次大戰以後，還是應該做奴隷抑或自由人的問題。但說得實際一點，從一個較近的角度來看，這是英美世界與反英美世界鬥爭的焦點。我們旣不屬於反英美世界，也並不屬於英美世界。在這個鬥爭上，我們似乎是局外人。然而世界是不可分的，和平也不可分的。我們的盟友總勸中國內部應該和平，我們深有同感；但我們也希望爲了人類的福利，世界的和平，我們的盟友間能够相忍相讓，互相作極大的讓步，以尋求國際協調，維繫世界和平。我們說到此，深深地感到美英蘇三國的政治領袖，像從前羅邱史的三巨頭會議，在戰時披肝瀝膽地傾談，大有恢復之必要。吾則祇讓幾位外長在會議席上斤斤互爭，全副精力都貫注在準備三次大戰軍略據點的打算上，則世界和平是大有問題的。特港問題雖是一個小問題，然一葉落而知天下秋，特港問題的不能解决，正是世界肅殺之氣重現的朕兆！</p>

<h3>貝爾納斯堅決要求　速定和會召開日期　對蘇代表拖延策略深表不滿　巴黎會議席上展開劇烈舌戰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿九日廣播：今日四强外長會議，將有最重要之決定，即和會是否於今夏召開是也。英法外長與貝爾納斯已一致要求和會應在今夏舉行，但莫洛托夫則表示反對。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿八日電〕美國務鄉貝爾納斯今日下午在四國外長三小時之全體會議中，因廿一國和會召開問題與莫洛托夫展開激烈舌戰，互相責難未能信守諾言。此事發先於會議行將休會之際，貝爾納斯雷即宣佈，渠當於明日要求外畏會議決定和會召開日期。蘇外長莫洛托夫亦即答以所有問題均須加以討論，然後乃可商定和會召開日期。至是貝爾納斯乃云，莫洛托夫提出許多問題，須在和會召開之前討論完畢，未免令人驚訝，如是則召開和會日期恐永無決定之日。莫洛托夫爰乃提議定於後日討論。</p>

<h3>莫斯科電台呼聲　反對美單獨簽約</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕外長會議己將結束，和約之命運仍在未定之天，而莫斯科電台則已發出呼聲，反對美國或英美集團與他國單獨簽訂和約。電台評述員能氏以英語廣播稱，美國境內已傳出單獨簽訂和約之聲，要知第一次世界大戰後，美國亦曾單獨與德議和，卒鑄成大錯，此决豈可再蹈覆轍。按六月初華盛頓曾傳出將單獨議和之報吿，莫斯科之宣傳當時並未有所反應，最近貝爾納斯及貝文復提出警吿，謂四强不能協議，亦不可使世界永久在戰爭狀態之下，因此單獨簽訂和約之傳說又起。能氏復提出第一次大戰後美德單獨議和後之結果，如美國資本之支持墨索里尼政權，並恢復威瑪共和國之經濟軍事力量等，卒造成希特勒之崛起及二次世界大戰之發生。換言之，即第一次世界大戰後，美國不但喪失其本國之和平，同時且喪失國際之和平，吾人姑不論美國政黨對於其外交政策之爭論爲如何，但覺美國目前確已有拒絕諸强團體，以保障世界持久和平之趨勢。</p>

<h3>美外交政策縱橫面</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>讓我國回過頭來，再稅一下「金元外交」的故事。我不能估計金元外交，能產生多少深厚的力量，然就表面上着，金元外交，確有其相當壯大的橡城。當英國五十萬萬大借款，在國會辯論的時候，英國的外交官，聞人，銀行家，都在美國作各種佈置和活動。下議院通過後，正要提出於上議院之際，忽然英國的權咸敎授拉茨基，工黨內閣的高等顧問，發表了一篇演講，大意說：英國不能單靠與美國爲友，而無端得罪於蘇聯。拉茨基警惕英國人民，要認清美國資本主義的沒落，要遠望蘇聯新興的力量他說；英國應該站在美蘇之間，　寗偏左於蘇聯的一邊。這篇演講傳到美國，許多報紙都起指者，略帶黃色而態度最右的紐約日報，寫了一篇非常生動的社論，刋着拉茨基的相片，下邊的註解是：「認淸英國人的眞面目」。社論裏說：正當美國在通過對英借款之際，工黨的大將拉茨基發表如此「恩將仇報」的演講。讓他們去跟蘇聯接近吧！反正，美國不能拿了綫交給旁人，再由旁人來打自己的耳光。紐約日報呼籲上　院否決對英借款，說：「現在工人鬧罷工，物價這麼高漲，爲什麼不拿這許多款子救救我們自巴的老百姓呢？」</p>
<p>英美畢竟一家</p>
<p>當然，紐約日報的嘗論，不會發生效力，拉茨基的大砲式演講，也不過說說而已。英美畢覺還是一家，美國人明知道英國拿了這筆錢，會造成美國國際貿易上的勁敵，但終於還是借了。我旁聽過好幾次國會討論借款問題的集會，那些白髮瀟瀟的議員們講話，很多幼稚而像「開玩笑」，他們紛紛提出借款的條件，有的說：「款是可以借的，但不許英國人再瞧不起美國」；有的說：「錢可以借給他們，但也吿訴那些英國人，不得再目中無人！」有的站起來一五一十說了三四十個條件，但除了租用軍事根據地一點可被人重視外，幾乎盡是些孩子氣的話。然要了解一個孩十氣國家的外交決策，也是不容易的。如我前面所說，巴黎會議是美外交政策的一個轉捩點，則巴黎會議以後，美外交的部署無處不該是十分積極的了，但是這裏面依然有一個問題存在，因為外交的本質不是備戰，備戰不能就算作外交，更何况美國百老姓並不希望與蘇聯開戰？基於這一個觀點，很多很多人，發出了不滿意貝爾納斯的聲音。這種不滿意無分民主黨共和黨，也無分在朝在野，我們如果一定要用黨的界限來區別，那末對於貝爾納斯外交政策抨擊最烈的，不是共和黨，却是民主黨自已。領導這一股力量的，我不能不指出華萊士先生，也許我的看法，有一點武斷，或言之過早，但就一點一滴的事實凑合起來者，民主黨確實在分家，而領導左派的人，慢慢地集結到華萊士的四週。我沒有研究過民主黨發展的歷史，但民主黨在美國，乃至於在世界的工作，確實是一個了不起的政治集團，目光之精，人才之衆，遠較共和黨優甚。至少在今天的情形如此，這意思並不是說共和黨沒有人，共和黨也有出衆的人才，爲美國人民一向所敬佩。但共和黨的人才多半是着着賞實的事業家，他們能規規矩矩做好一件事，但不能有獨到的眼光，走在時代的前面。舉例說：</p>
<p>美國包公杜威</p>
<p>共和黨的大將杜威，他從前富紐約市的檢察官，每年檢舉幾萬件謀財害命，妨碍社會的案子，正直無私，鐵面無情，當他在檢察官任內，紐約的老百姓，確實生命財產有保障，紐約人民一講起杜威，就是中國「七俠五義」裏邊的包公，如今這位美國包公。在當紐約州長，全州治安爲之井然有序。再譬如說：共和黨的大將前總統胡佛，他在當總統以前，辦過世界救災，公正廉明，迅速確實，所以後來美國人選他當總統；但一當總統，應付經濟不景氣，使手忙脚亂，四年一完，立刻下台。如今胡佛又在辦救濟，美國人深信他還是能辦得好，因爲他能專心，負責任做好一件事。我不知道這是不是共和黨的黨風？這種黨風和民主黨的人物完全兩樣。如果說，共和黨着着實寳的做法是正途，那麼，照中國的說法，民主黨的人才，多半是「偏鋒」，是「奇才」，他們有眼光，有魄力，不一定件件事都要自己做。也許這種作風過去受羅斯福的薰陶培育，也有關係。就拿外交政策來說，羅斯福在世的時候，民主黨有一塊千斤石壓住，又因戰時民主黨內部的意見步驟都是一致的，不但內部一致，運共和黨的人也都能爲羅斯福所用。羅斯福　後，千斤石沒有了，戰爭也完了，於是民主黨內部，外交政策和外交意見，就有了顯著的參　。華萊士先生活動的大本營，是紐約第四十二銜的莫洛摩飯店。我旁聽過好幾次華萊士先生在晚會上的講演，他的外交基本態度，是美國不應該仇視蘇聯，或自外於蘇聯。他銳：一和英國拉在一起走，一定會被英國拖下水的」。美國當今的外交責任是掌握世界和平的關鍵，美國尋求世界和平的唯一途徑，是站在英國和蘇聯的中間，不偏不倚。華萊士在每次演講的時候，很少正面抨擊現政府，但字裏行問，都是針對現政府的措施說的。他歡喜搬出羅斯福故總統的「遺志」那一套。我不知道這是不是民主黨的「正統之爭」？按理說，西洋社會是不大講究「正統」和「旁系」的，羅斯福夫人，常常很愛聽華萊士先生的演講。前國務卿史退丁紐斯，羅斯福夫人，華萊士先生和勞工部長施倫伯，他們是民主黨中間意氣此較相投的一羣，讓我武斷的替他們加一個名字吧：「民主黨中的左派」。　（續完）</p>

<h3>明日試驗原子彈　比基尼島爆炸巨聲　可收聽無綫電廣播　電波速度每秒十八萬六千里</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿八日電〕據科學家宣稱：七月一日比基尼珊瑚島試驗原子彈，當原子彈於礁瑚上面爆炸時，聲浪速度每秒鐘一千一百呎，而無綫電波之速度每秒綫則爲十八萬六千哩，故無綫電收　者，可先於參加試騐者而聽到原子彈爆裂聲響之寄蹟，當有實現可能。原子彈試騐司令白朗第曾將無綫電收聽原子彈燃炸之計劃發表。惟據紐約國家廣播公司宣　：收聽原子彈爆炸計劃尙未完全成熱，但將來如能付諸實現，諒係利用短波。白朗第之　則爲將播音器分別置於目標船上，此　音　興廣播試騐新聞之當臺相　　。其中一具將置於目　艦「本雪　几尼亞」號之上，此艦係位於各試騐艦船之中心，其餘各艦均停數百碼外，廣播新聞之際，「本雪爾凡尼亞」號上之電氣節奏器即開始發出「滴塔。滴塔」之聲。無綫電聽衆何時不聞此種「滴塔」聲音，即指明原子彈業已爆炸，因「本雪爾凡尼亞」號上之電氣節奏器或已於此時炸成粉粹。甚多海軍人士相信：其他距離較遠之目標船所賈擴音器，或不致同時炸毁，無綫電聽衆即可由此而聽到原子彈之爆裂聲。白朗第旗艦「麥金萊」號，亦置有擴音器，停在十哩之外，所播聲音聽衆可於原子彈爆炸後四十秒鐘聽到。記者船「阿派拉欽」號離目標船十五哩，亦備有擴音器廣播原子彈爆炸聲。</p>
<p>番紅色小船　測驗輻射能</p>
<p>〔聯合社「麥金萊」號旗艦廿八日電〕試騐艦隊中有番紅色之小船六艘，係長八十六呎之登陸艇改造而成，由雷擊機以無綫電操縱，將於原子彈爆炸後在機動部隊米敢貿然駛返目標區前，用以測騐礁湖內之輻射能。艦上實有傑吉爾計算器，可記礁湖內輻射能之數量，另有無綫囊計算器附裝於無綫電話機上，向各艦船報吿輻射能情形，發現輻射能時，傑吉爾計算器即發出「滴塔」之聲，輻射能　愈多，聲響之速度愈快，倘行近危險地帶，則「滴塔」版即加快而變爲「嗡嗡」之聲，偵察輻射能之小艇另裝特別配備，汲取礁湖內海水，携回實騐艦船分析。偵察輻射能之小艇並不用人駕駛。礁湖及各　固定地點安置附有測距器之計算　器，用以測知水流及氣統中之輻射能。同時另用飛機測量原子彈爆炸後，天空中所曾有輻射能之雲霧，其流動情形如何。輻射能可留存水中若干時間，不敢妄加推測，因無前例可據也。原子彈在空山爆炸時散佈空中之有毒物質數量最大。</p>
<p>爆炸後碎片　飛入同溫層</p>
<p>甚至可使爆裂之碎片飛入同溫層。據一部份科學家估：原子彈射綫殘留地而之存覺，可等於鐳錠數噸。水中爆炸時可能　中大量幅射能，惟海水內之礦物質，是否將使原來核子分裂之危險性擴大或延長，則待試騐後始能知之。但海水高潮時可自東而礁　中將含錫質之海水流人礁湖，使湖內水質迅速改變，然則湖水之幅射能或可早日淸除。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿八日電〕彈試騐後，將有無綫電操縱之飛行堡壘四架及海軍機多架，立即飛往偵察、以無綫電傳影機報道爆炸景蒙，俾供科學家作精確研究。</p>

<p>〔聯合社比基尼「麥金萊」號旗艦廿九日電〕海軍部長福萊斯特今日在旗艦上向新謂記者宣稱：此次原于彈試騐非無價値，可以發生預先算就之結果。所選供轟炸之輪船，令人極感興趨，日本戰鬥艦長門號被炸後發生何種結果，尤使予注意。</p>

<h3>視察廣島被炸情形　美專家報告發表　證明原子彈威力確屬可怖　應擬具遠大計劃防備襲擊</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕杜魯門總統派赴日本視察原子彈轟炸情形之各專家，已於今日提出報吿，由新澤西保險公司之奧華爾起草，內中主張美國應　擬定一遠大計劃，以防原子彈襲整。據稱，廣島及長崎兩地被炸情形，證明原子彈之危險並非子虛，美國「現在」即當準備如何應付原子炸彈，且不可稍有懈怠。所有美國軍隊應予分散·隱匿。並加以保護，此外並應時時刻刻小心翼翼，庶不致於遭一次或數次原子彈轟炸後，即無反攻之力。爲保護人民起見，應建築能抵抗原子彈爆炸·閃光·燒傷·及幅射作用之防禦物。其他如建築更堅强之房屋，組織備有谷種緊急用品及配備之全國預備防衛團·疏散各種工業及醫藥設備·以及撤退城市之計劃等，均屬必要之圖。同時陸軍部襲哈頓之原子彈製造工程處亦提出性質相似之報吿。兩報吿中均不信原子彈爆炸時，一部份人係死於留在被炸區內之幅射能。但據赴日視察專家稱，如原子彈不在離地面數百尺之上空，而係在地平面爆炸，則情景之慘將有甚於此者。陸軍部宣稱，初次報吿中謂第一顆原子彈，大約包含二萬噸ＴＮＴ炸藥之說，想係可靠。惟總統視察專家估計二千一百噸之高度炸藥·燒夷彈，及開花彈如在廣島擲下，可收同樣功效。兩報吿書對原子彈之投擲及其焚燒破壞可怕情形，均有生動描寫，對爆炸之原理及其破壞性質亦加叙述，但未洩露任何原子秘密。據陸軍部宣稱，第一顆原子彈之爆炸，約在一九四二年秋規定，當時選擇目標係以下列各項條件爲根據，如：飛機航行之遠近·環境是否容易辯識投彈目標·天氣情形。第二次投彈目標之距離，（長崎爲第二目標），對日本民衆及縮短戰事期限在軍事上發生何種影響，對敵軍士氣有何影響等。專家視察報吿書基於原子彈破壞情形向美國民衆警吿稱，原子彈之危險性確乎屬實，經赴日視察後而益信。</p>

<h3>稀世珍籍　嘉靖萬曆上海縣志　入藏市通志館　井十年前發現弘治縣志　堪稱珠聯壁合空前盛事</h3>
<p>稀世之珍籍明嘉靖及萬曆兩部上海縣志，今已人藏於上海市通志館矣。此舉與該館十年前發現弘治上海縣志，構成上海志書歷史上珠聯璧合之空前盛事。據該館負責人稱：上海縣志在明代凡三修，三百年來，囊括入藏者，僅上海市通志館而已，蓋弘治志明代而下未有觀者，孤本向藏天乙閣，隱晦無聞。至民國二十五年，始由該館訪悉，商攝副本。嘉靖志則康熙重修上海志時，已不及見，孤本爲汲古閣物。萬曆志在康熙間版已朽蝕，舉世所有，僅徐家匯天主堂及吳興蔣孟蘋二部，與北平圖書館半部。市通志館勤求文獻，博訪廣徵，復館以來，　繼戰前工作，卒獲將嘉萬二志購藏，並弘治志而完成明代上海三志之收藏。其在歷史上之意義，實爲「北五年版上海市年鑑，及上海便覽之編輯，或已出版，或在印刷。典藏方面，業將八一三後密存之圖籍數萬册，收還整理，並繼續訪購與上海文獻有關之典籍。該館在行政機關中為最富學術研究性之機構，工作熱情，自其斐然成就見之。又悉：弘治志孤本前經該館影印，嘉萬二志，並擬援例覆石，佔計每部工本約四萬元，刻正發起附印，茍達百部之數，即行開工云。</p>

<h3>本市工礦建設協會　經濟會議前夕　商討目前經濟問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中樞即將召開全國經濟計劃會議，本市工礦建設協會昨於金門飯店八樓茶會商討目前各項經濟問題，到工商界及專家蔡叔厚·楊開道·陳寳驛·水祥雲·吳覺農等二十餘人。席間發言熱烈，對當前吾國經濟危機之糧結，討論頗詳，至六時餘始散會，一般意見，可歸納成下列數點：（一）外匯率目前不宜更改，惟對於進出口業應按照性質，採用等差結匯或另行津貼之辦法。（二）國營民營問題，原則上自當發達國家資本，惟目前國營事業實際上爲官僚買辦資本所把持，故應採取民主作風，以不妨害民營爲原則。（三）物價問題，根本上當求政府收支之平衡，如不能平衡，亦當公開其程度，其次須交通暢順並把握物質。對於日本必須要求賠償實物如機器設備等。（四）民族工業破產之主因並不在於工資之高昂，在目前之情形下勞資尤應合作。現匯率旣不便更改，至少須求得關稅之自主，此外中央銀行之借款利率似嫌過高。（五）一切經濟危機之根本解决，仍在於政治上國內之和平，及國際之安定。</p>

<h3>共方反美宣傳　美軍表示冷淡</h3>
<p>執行旣定政策協助國府　不因任何障礙有所變更</p>
<p>此間美軍對於中共方面要求美軍自中國撤退及毛澤東責言美軍助長中國內戰之事，甚表冷淡，並以爲此種宣傳對美國在華政策毫無影營，渠等表示今日代表中國政府者爲國民黨，吾人若欲協助中國各方簡之發展，自以其政府爲對象，美軍對於中共之惡意宣傳，圖甚爲注意，但稱美國對華政策及協助其復員計劃，早已有定議，一切政策不因何種障礙而變更。</p>

<h3>職工生活費指數　本月份稍有上落</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本月份本市生活費指數，業經市政府研究室編製竣事，於昨日正式公布。本市工人生活費總指數爲四〇四·〇六五·三九，較上月份低一·三四％。職員生活費總指數爲三一九·五一七·六六，較上月份高四·八八％。本月份工人生活指數較上月略低之原因，全爲本月糧價之下跌，按上月食物之指數，爲四五二·三一三·六六，本月份食物之指數爲四三八·四五四·一九，約降低三·〇六％。其他如住屋·衣着·雜品等均現略漲，茲記者特將上月份及本月份之工人生活費指數比較，列表如下：</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市廣肇公所爲請求確認買賣土地無效，控吿擅賣公產之溫逆宗尭及受買之謙泰商業銀行等，昨日地院續審，被吿方面辯稱，當時曾經董事會數度決議，溫宗尭係以法定代理人之資格行動者，與其充任僞司法院院長之政治行爲無關，故請駁回原吿之訴，原吿則擬於下次補呈證據，庭上准予補呈，乃諭展期再訊。又本案訴訟費雖達一百三十萬元，但尙不能認爲地院受理案件中之最鉅者，因新亞飯店之產權訟案訴訟費計二千餘萬，則較此案更多矣。</p>
<h3>「今年無夏天」預言打破</h3>
<p>原子彈影響氣候說亦不成立</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕天文學家曾有「今年無夏天」之預言，覜乎近日天氣奇熱，常證此預言之不確。記者爲欲探知今年夏令將熱至如何程度，特於昨日走訪外灘上海氣象台台長鄭子政。據鄭氏云：過去六十九年間，以一九三四年之夏令溫度最高，計六月華氏一度七，七月一〇四度三，八月一〇四度。此六十九年中，夏令之最高溫度平均爲九十五度，而今年之最高溫度爲六月二十七日，九十九度。鄭氏以爲此度數，一般說來，尙稱正常。今年之七八月間，可能尙有熱天，惟變動不多，決不致奇熱如一九三四年。鄭氏又稱，前報載今年氣候反常，係受原子彈影響，依科學觀點看來，此說不能成立。</p>

<h3>建警工作刻不容緩　李士珍氏發抒意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央署官學校校長李士珍氏，頃對目前有關警察之若干重要間題，發抒意見，茲特探錄其要點如次：李氏首先揭葉蔣主席之召示：「建國的基礎在警察，」故認爲建警工作，實屬刻不容緩。然警察工作之開展，須建於愛護人民，及服務社會之基點上，更須把握歷史重心，行仁政。適應時代潮流，施法治。我國警察辦理不善，李氏認爲原因有三：（一）係素質不够，（二）係待遇太低，（三）係設備簡陋。故欲改善我國警察，務從此三方面力求改進，方能談到建立現代國家之警察。自敵人投降後，社會秩序迄未恢復，此中癥結，李氏認爲係警察勤務方式之不良。服務無一定範圍，責任遂無法確認。最近京滬兩地實施之警管區制，即係針對此一缺陷而設。惟外界認該制係在加强管理人民，實屬誤解。李氏旋對民主與警察問題，亦詳加分析。渠認爲談民主即離不開法律，而法律之推行者，即係警察。故警察實爲實行民主之工具。李氏末對警察本身方面，希望能修養道德，轉變過去觀念。同時亦深望社會人士，對警察觀念，亦應轉變，應重視並信賴警察。深望關係各界，對建警工作，應從多方面，予以協助，以便迎頭趕上，與世界列强之警察，並駕齊驅。</p>

<h3>上海的病人！人往何處云？</h3>
<p>……本報採訪室集體執筆……</p>
<p>病人在歧路上徬徨　服用成藥呢？　還是延醫診治呢？</p>
<p>有了病，要吃藥，那是犬經地義，可是什麼藥吃了的確能醫病，什麼藥吃了等於白吃，什麼藥吃了非但沒有功效而且會害人，這中間大有研究的必要。對於第一種，如果病人服了對診的藥，果然體格恢復健康，那根本無話可說。但對於後面兩種情形却是最普遍也是最危險的，這裏不妨試舉幾個普通的例子供大家參考。</p>
<p>（一）我們都知道，肺癆這一種病，在中國是最流行同時是最可怕的，但至今尙無特效藥發明，不幸而患了這病，祗有格外注意日常生活，營養，空氣，日光，多多休息，此外請醫生診療，藥物與手術並行，使病者體內結核菌被鈣化而自動停止蔓延。要醫治這富貴病，需時很久，而市上出售的所謂肺病特效藥，其實僅爲普通治呼吸器病的藥品，充其量內含Creosol　and　Guaiacol（通稱幾怪）二種殺菌藥，但據近代生物細菌學家研究所得結論，謂結核萬爲一蠟狀硬壳所包，至今未發明有什麼藥物足以透入此壳，可見殺菌藥的效用也就有限得很了。</p>
<p>（二）提起「胃病」這兩字，又是使人頭痛的一樁事情，旣痛苦又頑固，而患者特別多。患者宜注意天時寒暖，飲食有節，不食難於消化及刺激性等物，多吃水菓蔬菜，少食生脂肪及炭酸氣的食品。目前市上銷售的胃藥，多數爲鹹性，內含小蘇打及　茄類製劑，以鹹性去中和胃酸。　茄本含少量膺鹹（阿刀屏），故有鎭瘧止痛之效，這種飲酖止渴的療法，僅能見效於一時，根本無除病之望，而常服的結果，反使胃臟麻木，不能分泌胃酸黏液而至潰瘍，若病者本已胃分泌太弱，胃酸太少，則服之受害，更可想而知。</p>
<p>（三）在嚴厲禁烟令下，戒烟藥品應時而生，但從無一人眞因購服這種藥品而完全戒絕的，此類藥品，大抵含有安眠劑，麻醉品，服之僅能作代替品，多服亦能成癢。所以戒毒必須延醫按法注射，服藥遞减，否則身體日趨衰弱，舊疾新病，一併發作，不可收拾。</p>
<p>（四）痧眼一疾，中國人患者亦特多，多數是由於不注意衛生傳染而得。要醫治，非動手術剖除不可，市上所售各項眼藥，其成分不外硼酸等幾項藥物，功效僅能治療普通目疾，而對於痧眼全無效力可言，此點亟應注意</p>
<p>（五）廣吿牌上常常可以見到專治小兒百病的藥品，其實稍具醫學常識者，都知道從未有一藥能治百病的，此種藥物，主要內含小道年及甘汞，僅能治便秘及殺除蛔蟲而已，而這兩種都是烈性藥，多服難免中毒，藥商並　不明白此點，所以「但求無過，不求有功，「使藥內含量極少，但因此也失去效用了。</p>
<p>（六）梅毒，花柳，大家都知道要打「六〇六」「九一四」這類老牌針藥。一般滑頭醫生，大事宣傳，說幾天幾週可以斷根實在是玩他們的把戲。有時，患這種病的，給醫生們打了幾針，的確皮　上的瘡疤，慢慢新陳代謝了，醫生就說：「你的病已經斷根了，以後可以不必再看。」那知「外强中乾」，裏面的血根本還是毒的。所以有病者必須請正當醫生診治，隨時要檢騐血液，一直等到血裏一點毒素都沒有爲止，</p>
<p>（七）講起補藥，眞是不勝枚舉，什麼丸呀，精呀，膏呀，汁呀，素呀，劑呀，賜保命呀之類，都是給有錢人們做做點綴品的害多益少，而眞正有價値者却不易覓得。一般藥液所謂內含維他命A，B，C，D，等等的，却是騙的話，須知維他命之性質，A，D，溶於油，而B，C，溶於水，則可見A，D，混合者者都爲油　，B，C,混合者都爲水劑，要四種混合，除固體外，則非作乳劑不可，液體是辦不到的。</p>
<p>（八）還有許多藥品，雖然是貨眞價實，名不虛傳，但往往有「冒名頂替」「改頭換面」的東西，混淆視聽，而且應用時，數量，用法，性質，一有變化，就全功棄盡譬如拿配尼西林這名藥來說，這種藥必須保存在沸氏零度下十度的溫度中，否則即易失去效騐。即使是溶解劑，如果超過製就後七天以上的，亦不再發生效力。有人往往想塌便宜貨，大批購進，結果是空歡喜一塲。此外，像注射葡萄糖針，必必每次注射百分之五十的四十C，C，才有效，少於四十C，C，的量就無大用處了。血淸與抗毒素，也應保存在五度及十五度之間。又像DDT的偸工减料辦法，已經是公開的秘密了，與其上當，不如不用。</p>
<p>最後，我們不希望有病的人因爲怕藥力無效而不吃藥，不過總以愼重爲是。有人想省些錢，隨便買些成藥吃吃，結果是「偷鷄勿着蝕把米」。要知「金錢事小，性命事大」，如果有了病，延請正當醫師治療，對病服藥價錢不一定會比成藥昻貴，而奏效當指日可待。</p>

<h3>星期論壇　從都市計劃觀點論上海市之劃界</h3>
<p>— 趙祖康</p>
<p>上海市市區範圍，自民國十六年奉行政院核定地界，嗣於十七年間，市府僅接收十七鄉區，尙餘十三鄉區以江蘇省政府未能交出，作爲市方暫緩接收區域，以迄於今，懸案不決，蓋已十有餘年，市鄉發展交受其困，未接收之鄉民則大多蘄望市府即予接管建設。茲値省市兩方於抗戰勝利之初繼續商討劃界期間，願以都市計劃之出發點，從客觀分析比較，一論此應有的合理解決之原則與實際問題。</p>
<p>近代都市之建立，可視爲國家或政治文化經濟交通之焦點，都市繁榮得到合理之發展，則國家或世界蒙受其福利，此理至明，無庸詳論。故戰後歐美各國建設，對於農村之普遍建設雖甚重視，而於都市之復興擴展尤極注意。英國對於市鄉建設，有市鄉建設計劃部之設立；美國對於都市居屋都市街道等，在戰時及戰後聯邦政府，均予以行政上及經費上之協助。至於都市之計劃，則無論英美，每有以附近小城市及鄉村配合，一併規劃，以期得到較爲完善之設計對象。</p>
<p>是以省市劃界之原則，首應以從整個國家政治經濟文化交通的利害之衡斷爲前提，再次則應以市爲中心，而以鄰接縣鄉爲其輔佐，共岡發展爲目標，最後則應注意無傷於省之政治經濟文化交通之將來的地位。此三原則，實爲討論省市劃界雙方所應共同採取之依據。</p>
<p>上海市之都市計劃初步工作，現正由市工務局積極進行。都市計劃者，「都市之整個的遠大的自然底成長（PhysicalDevelopment）計劃」之謂。都市之自然的建設，其固定性較社會的建設爲大，故尤須有遠大整個計劃爲其目標，始不致貽削足適履，噬臍莫及之患。上海都市計劃之擬訂，現正以今後五十年計劃爲目標，而再以五年計劃十年計劃爲推進之步驟。故論上海市目前區域範圍，如以五十年計劃爲對象，最爲合理。茲姑將「人口密度」「水綫長度」「交通配備」「綠面積與工業區」等四點，分諭其需要：</p>
<p>上海人口在民國二十五年計有三百八十萬，在目前據市府民政處今年四月調查則爲三百三十九萬，尙有塘灣周浦二區，未統計在內。（其中經受戰事影響，在人口曲綫上，有顯明之中斷。）據以往六十年之統計紀錄，估計未來之發展，參照馬爾薩斯人口論，上海人口之成長每二十五年增爲二倍，五十年後則爲現有之四倍，即一千二百萬人。即從嚴格佔計，今後上海市計劃如以一千萬人口爲對象，當不能謂爲誇大。至於人口之密度，現在有達每方公里二十萬人以上者（黃浦警區浙江路一帶及泰山警區西門一帶），照我人所擬都市計劃，將來擬分爲三級，計每平方公里計（一）五千人，（二）七千五百人，（三）一萬人。蓋人口過密，不特有碍衛生，助成交通擁擠，且可使生活狀况低落，增加造成犯罪之原因。近代都市建設均趨向於人口之分散，不得不爾也。照上三級分布，如以民十六年奉准之上海區域範圍面積八百九十餘平方公里計，五十年後僅可容七百萬人，以總數一千萬人計，尙有三百萬人須居住於市區之外，其一部份不啻爲上海市民朝來本市，夕散四鄉，其一部份則爲上海四周衛星城市鄉鎭之人民。此從人口密度論，上海市區倘不能擴大範圍，至少亦當照民十六規定以應事實需要，一也。</p>
<p>上海市之繁榮，甚有賴於揚子江與黃浦江水綫之發展。上海港口之吞吐量，在民國十九年達最高紀錄，計進出口船舶總噸位爲三千八百萬噸，大約居全世界港埠中第七第八位次，在吾國則爲第一鉅埠。吾人倘比擬吳淞寳山爲上海之咽喉，則黃浦江不啻爲上海之食管腸胃。現寳山城因縣城關係，民十六範鬨即未能作合理之劃分，劃歸上海市區，黃浦江上游，如曹行·塘灣·北橋·顓橋·馬橋·莘莊·七寶·閔行等鄉，亦在暫緩接收之列。上海市現有浦江碼頭水綫約一萬二千公尺，照今後五十年發展計劃，上海市港口吞吐量，大約可達每年一萬萬噸，其碼頭水錢，應有約三萬公尺，勢須非儘量利用黃浦江兩岸不可。此從水綫長度論，上海市區域似應以寳山縣城劃入市區，而黃浦江兩岸至少仍照民十六定案，二也。</p>
<p>都市之盛衰，繫於水陸空交通者極大，上海市區內鐵路路綫及車站之配合，未能合乎理想，有碍市內各種工商運輸業之發展。前上海市工務局所擬都市計劃，亦包有對於京滬滬杭甬兩鐵路路綫與車站之改錢改地建議，由前上海市政府咨請前鐵道部，予以考慮，乃因限於經費，格於環境，中央地方未能切實合作，至計劃不能實現，殊屬可惜。茲者，租界收回，各種交通技術，顯有進步，是項計劃或須修訂，但鐵路貨運總站之應自麥根路移往滬西，鐵路客運總站之應改建，或亦向外略移，似均屬必要之岡，此與市區範圍至有關係。如楊行·大塲·眞茹，自須仍屬市區，庶易配置；他如滬南之龍華·閔行，滬西之虹橋·七寳·莘莊，浦東之周浦等處，或爲機塲所在，或爲鐵路所經，或爲公路所通達，均係交通衝要之區，自應仍屬於上海市區以內。此從交通配備論，上海市區應照民十六原案規定，三也。</p>
<p>上海建成區域，如前公共租界前法租界及虹口等一帶，市肆林立，房屋櫛比，人口密度至高，公園曠地不敷。據我人調查統計，現有公國面積，約一千市畝，合六十餘公頃，就建成區論，約合面積千分之六點七，如以全市論，則僅合面積萬分之八。今後園地布置，自應照近代都市設計，多設「綠地帶」及公園曠塲等，而現在尙未建設之鄉區，最合於此項理想布置之用，亦即鄉區之加入市區者愈多，則園塲布置愈能充分，愈合於優美衛生之理想。照倫敦戰後計劃之理想，僅就公園面積論計合每千人得地四英畝，倘以今後五十年上海人口一千萬計，應有公園面積四萬英畝，合一萬六千公頃，較之現狀，須添關者何止二三百倍？</p>
<p>至於上海工廠地點，自經淪陷於敵偽管理，漸有侵入住宅區之趨勢，即滬西亦所不免，對於居民健康，有甚大之威脅。此種工廠，不少爲染織廠或製革廠，所排汚水尤碍衛生，亟應確定分區辦法，責令改善，或竟還移。至將來滬市工業前途，一旦港口鐵路改良擴充，自更方興未艾，所需廠基土地，尤無限制，工業區之規劃，目前已屬不容或緩，此從「綠面積」及工業區論，上海市區域亦應維持民十六舊案所規定，四也。</p>
<p>要之，上海市區之面積，如照民十六案全都接收，則與北平市相埒，較之歐美各大都市，如紐約·倫敦·支加哥等，尙不如遠甚。倘更劉過小，本市旣捉襟見肘，無以展布，即鄰近各縣，亦同受其害，必也，予以合理適當之區域，至少如民十六原案者，則不特本市可有發展之地，即鄰近各衛星縣鄉，亦將同沾其利。現歐美先進各國，已從都市計劃，進而至於區域計劃，及國家計劃，其政治區域已漸漸設法與經濟區域相配合，則上海市區域範圍之劃定，應從整個國家民族復興建設之觀點出發，以力謀吾國第一港埠第一都市及其四週各縣鄉之繁榮發展也，明矣。（卅五·六廿八·）</p>
<h3>私人醫院　一種變相的旅館</h3>
<p>翻開電話簿，你一定會因爲上海醫院之多而感到驚異。大大小小，從設備相當完全，包羅各科的虹橋療養院起，到專門治療狐臭的醫院爲止，單以私家醫院而論，總數就有二百多家。</p>
<p>這二百多家醫院之中，備有病床的，數目不到三分之一。西藏路上有一家「醫院」，祗有一間房間，把前面沿馬路的部份夾了一層板壁，留出一尺多闊的地方，左邊開了個小窗，就是排號處，右面就是進「醫院」的門。管掛號的就是這位醫院襄唯一的護士，主持這家醫院的，也就是這醫院裏唯一的醫生。醫生的營業似乎並不興旺，然而它還是在地價如金的西藏路上維持着，這一種「最小型的」私人醫院，大多數都集中在西藏路，此外，在九江路，漢口路也有，主要都是專治花柳病。</p>
<p>比這些醫院稍爲大一點的，是有設備而且有時不止一個醫生的醫院，不過沒有病房。這種「醫院」，其實就等於是某幾位醫師的「診所」，許多牙醫院似乎就可以歸入這一類。</p>
<p>開設私人醫院　就等於開旅館一樣</p>
<p>然而，一般人提起上海的私人醫院來，總是指那些富麗堂皇，一進門就是佈置精雅的花園，草地上有兩三個病人坐在藤椅裏休養的那些療養院之類。論醫師水準之高，看護之比較週到，這些私人醫院是多數超過了一般公立醫院的。這些醫院裏的病房，也比較舒服，所以就更爲那些達官貴人和巨賣名流們所歡迎。而那些私人醫院所歡迎的，也就是這一班手頭闊綽的主顧。有一位醫師，在一家很著名的私人療養院裏已經工作了四五年了，他說：「平心而論醫院在醫藥方面並沒有賺很多錢，換句話說，開私人醫院是和開旅館差不多的。</p>
<p>這是一種企業　談不上「人海慈航」</p>
<p>他說：有時，這些醫院也會「吃倒賬」。病人進來時，付了一點錢，可是後來，實在負担不起了，醫院就祗得自認晦氣。</p>
<p>「那麼，進院時付不出一筆錢的人，就根本沒有診病的希望了麼？」記者問。</p>
<p>他聳聳肩說，「爲甚麼公立醫院不設備得好一些呢？它們不是可以有聯總的帮助麼？」</p>
<p>他重復着說，辦私立醫院是一種企業，至少「醫院老閣」這樣相信。</p>
<p>什麼「普救衆生」，「人海慈航」……之類的話，從我嘴邊縮了回去。</p>
<p>醫院清靜得多　所以不包旅館房間</p>
<p>他還吿訴我，在敵僞時代，有一天醫院裏忽然來了一位什麼僞官的親戚，硬要把全部病房都包下來，供這位闊病人的侍從居住。結果，醫院裏拚拚凑湊，給了他十個房間，病人們自然只好　選到別的醫院裏去了。</p>
<p>也許因爲他看出了我有些吃驚，他說，「別的醫院裏，空房間多得很呢！有些人會在醫院裏包長房間，眞有病人的時候，這種房間還是騰得出來的——只要你和醫院裏的人們够得上交情。」</p>
<p>記者順便問他那些包長房間的客人們旣然並沒有什麼病，爲甚麼不包旅館房間？那位醫生神秘地笑起來了，他說：「醫院裏不是淸靜一點麼？」</p>
<h3>公立醫院二三事</h3>
<p>在米珠薪桂的今日，如果你不幸受到了病魔的拜訪，你一方面想早除痛苦，一方面又想减少經濟上的損失，你一定會焦慮：進那一間醫院好呢？從任何方面講，歷史悠久規模宏大的公立醫院一定比較地合於你的胃口，然而，上海的公立醫院有好幾家，情形又怎麼樣呢？</p>
<p>從西區海格路的紅十字會醫院到滬東提籃橋的中國醫院，中間分佈在車馬喧囂的鬧市裏的有白克路的中美，北京路的宏仁，山東路的仁濟，金神父路的廣慈，還有市立的第一·第二·第三·第四醫院，以及在那五層樓的廊欄上可以遠眺蘇州河風景的公濟……，所有這些醫院，依照它們的性質可以分成三類：一類是慈善機關辦的，一類是敎會辦的，另一類是政府機關辦的。它們或多或少担負着重要的社會保健任務，如果上海市內沒有這些醫院的存在，我眞不敢想像上海的市民們將遭遇到怎樣的命運。</p>
<p>現在我們，不妨將這些醫院作一番粗略的比較：它們全都有着宏偉的建築，完善的設備，白衣護士穿梭似的　來不絕。如果一定要說些特色，那末海格路的紅十字會環境最幽靜，中美醫院的設備較完備，公濟醫院大門口的一片草地最令人生好感，而它的價目却算得是頭等貴族化。</p>
<p>目前各醫院的門診費從四百元到一千元左右不等，公濟醫院有一種所謂「專科門診」，却要五千元一次。住院的價目也大有上落，例如仁濟醫院的特等病房每天一萬六，頭等一萬四，宏仁醫院頭等就要二萬四，而公濟醫院竟高至三萬五。不過，各醫院對於平民大都予以優待，所以三等病房的價目較頭二等相差甚遠，普通都在二千元左右，即如最貴族化的公濟，也有「平民病牀」的設立，雖然每天房價仍是高達五千元。</p>
<p>差不多所有的公立醫院，都有許多共同的缺點，就其犖犖大者而言：第一，病人進院的時候，必須預繳一筆巨額的「保證金」性質的費用，頭等病房大約自三十萬至四十萬，三等病房也要十萬元左右。由於這一規定的嚴格執行，以往就產生過不少次的悲劇，常常有些貧苦的危急病人，由於無力繳納這一筆巨額費用，院方拒絕收容病人，竟至見死不救。</p>
<p>第二，担任普通門診的醫生大都資歷較漢，或是初出茅廬的醫科學校實習生，他們能力旣差，更由於求診的人數衆多，診斷不免草率馬虎。發熱的給你開些蘇打粉，「打班子」的給你些奎寗丸，生皮膚病的就給你搽些硫磺膏。病人們懷了很大的希望，在擁擠的候診室裏等了大半天，結果却僅僅得到這種自己也懂得的藥方，自免不了怨聲載道。</p>
<p>第三，住院的病人最需要的是護士的照顧與慰藉，但是有許多「小姐」都似乎還不明瞭服務的意義，視病人爲討厭東西。尤其在三等病房裏，更常有置病人呻吟於不顧或要一杯白開水而不可得的受難情形。</p>
<p>上面所說，也許不免有「求全」責備之嫌。實際上，我們誠懇地希望全上海的公立醫院能不斷的設法改善，力求進步，推而惠及一般平民，以實現它們偉大的造福人羣的目的。</p>

<h3>派別·派別·派別！　醫藥上的英·美·德日·法國</h3>
<p>從外表上看起來，醫師是自由職業的一種。不想他的內幕，却是派別衆多，涇渭各殊。各派間門戶之見，煞是深刻。據醫界中人說，最顯著的可分爲三派：</p>
<p>英美派</p>
<p>一是英美派：這一派的醫師，佔全國醫師人數一半以上。據說：在這個大動脈下，還分了許多支流。以國外而言，聲勢比較顯赫的，要推哈佛和霍浦　斯兩派。國內方面，也分湘雅，上海，齊魯，協和等醫院派別。這條大動脈，在國內醫師界裏，說得上是佔了領導的地位。</p>
<p>德日派　是一條大靜脈</p>
<p>二是德日脈：假使說目前英美派是國內醫師界的大動脈，那末德日派，正是條大靜脈。屬於這個大系統下的醫師人數，也足與英美派匹敵。德日派中，國外的以漢堡和東京帝大畢業的較負盛名。國內也有同濟，同德，東南等校，這個大系統屬下的各校，其門戶之見尙不如英美派之深刻。</p>
<p>法國派　聲勢比較薄弱</p>
<p>三是法國派：這派聲勢較薄弱。大致是因爲出身於法國的醫師，人數不如前兩派的踴躍。本市震旦醫學院，是國內該派的代表學院。</p>
<p>這英不妨舉個例子。假使說英美派哈佛系統裏的醫師，要是做了某個醫院的院長，他總得想法把各科的主任醫師，淸一色的掉上一批哈佛人馬。說得更透澈些，一個病人首次施用手術時，是請敎了一位哈佛系統裏的醫師，病未愈而想掉一位霍浦金斯系統裏的醫師接下去看，這是絕對辦不到的事。因爲這位霍浦金斯系統裏的醫師，要是探悉了你就診的經過後，他準會毫不遲疑的向你搖頭，提起醫包就走。這也許是不可思議的事情。可是，目前醫師界裏類此的事件，正經常的演出着！</p>
<p>以英美派大系統下的各個小支流，還要涇渭自分。英美派德日派，法國派之間的鴻溝，是怎樣的深邃·讀者是不難想像的了。</p>
<h3>門戶之見　會變意氣之爭</h3>
<p>除了這三大派別外，還有不少由藥劑師和看護等人實習而行醫的。他們或她們，隨醫實習滿三年以上，可向衛生署領取通字醫師執照，或是經過甄試手續，而縣　問世。</p>
<p>有人說：這種派別的造成，是因爲研究的系統有別。對同一病狀的診斷和處方，各有一定的步驟和方法，不能有一絲的紊亂。也有人說：門戶之見太深刻了，難免不成爲意氣之爭。我們爲病人的福利着想，但願前說是符合於社會的現實。</p>
<h3>產婦的苦悶</h3>
<p>鉅額接生費已經負担不了　遺棄嬰孩更將如何謀決策</p>
<p>走在上海的街道上，不時會有各式各樣的醫院招牌映入眼簾，尤其多的是「產科醫院」。衛生局正在設法統計，然而已經登記的醫院却寥寥無幾。關於院內的設施，收費等等，自然更無從調查。</p>
<p>五花八門　六七十家</p>
<p>據記者粗略的估計：上海五花八門，大大小小的產科醫院，爲數不下六七十家，此外，多數的醫院中，都附設着這產科的一部分，這許許多多的醫院中，各不相同。經記者訪問結果，各方面都覺得上海的產科醫院，大約可分爲下列四等：</p>
<p>所謂超等　金條廿根記者名之謂「超等」，自然，其環境不平凡，設備不平凡，醫生不平凡，手術不平凡，而收費亦不平凡——二十根大條子！你也許不相信，可是記者可提醒你：這畢竟是上海！賣二十萬元錢一客西菜的夜總會，照樣天天「客滿」，何况是產科醫院？話得說回來，能够領敎這種不平凡手術的，究竟是少數中的少數。同時，這種「超等」醫院與「超等」醫生，一年之中，只要施用一二次不平凡的手術，就可以度其優哉遊哉的臺華生活了，</p>
<p>特等醫院　收費苛雜</p>
<p>屬於這一醫院，在上海也並不普通，給一般人的印象已經是相當「貴族化了」！他們平均的接生費，是卅萬元，住院費，醫藥費等一概另付，難產加倍，自然，掛號費非預繳不可。產前產後，槪由院方負責看護，確保母子安全。裏面的醫生，在學理與經騐上比較可靠的居多，但是偌大的費用，普通人怎麼負祖得了？</p>
<p>中等醫院　生手接生</p>
<p>說及中等的也就是最普通的一類醫院，數目比較多，住院生產的人也佔最大多數。接生費與房間的等級成正比例，大約頭等病房每天收費二萬元，接生費爲五萬元，此外還得另加臨產閒租費，手術費，材料費，育護費等，總額不會是筆小數目。可是，要注意：多數由院中的助產士接生，因爲根據產科學校規定，在暑期以前，至少須有二十次的實習經驗，而這許多學生實習的對象，便是院中的產婦，在開始實習時，僅由醫生在旁指示督察而已。但是生手接生，難免不週到的地方，這時你可以指定醫師，只要你肯多化錢，（普通是加倍收費，）因此付不起錢的三等病房的產婦，便成爲了她們實習的對象。</p>
<p>廉價招徠了敲詐有術</p>
<p>記者所謂的「劣等」，並非指医院的設備而論，上海有許多產科醫院，儘管有很堂皇的門面，有不少的分院，但是他們的內容是卑劣的，以最低廉的接生費作號召，用催生針，止痛針，補血針作敲詐術，這已是公開的秘密。最可怕的，是那些所謂產科醫生每天竟在那裏做無數純潔小生命的屠夫！據上海著名的產科醫師說：爲一個未結婚的婦女打胎，是一件最危險的事情，但是這些劣等醫生的眼中只認錢，性命是槪置不問的·他們是有罪的，但是這萬惡社會却蹤容着他們犯罪，讓他們每天偸偸地繼續殺人！</p>
<p>為民服務　嘉惠產婦</p>
<p>最後，記要介紹者一所真正爲平民服務的產科醫院——康腦脫路九九五號上海平民婦孺醫院。該院創辦於民國廿八年，現由王逸　醫師負大部分經濟上的責任。院址位於平民及工廠區，施診尤爲殷切·院中的醫生多數爲虔誠的基督徒·本耶穌犧牲之精神，服務人羣·只要家境確實淸貧者，可請求全部免費。近來由「行總」介紹去的產婦很多。除一切費用免收外，更供給膳食，產婦每人每餐食麵條八兩，麵粉由「行總」配給。此外，尙有奶粉和藥品等。貧病產婦出院時，還由院方配給奶粉若干。</p>
<p>棄嬰問題　最感棘手</p>
<p>他們目前最感覺無能為力的，是嬰兒的收容，因爲有許多窮困的母親，無法養活自己的孩子，她們往往忍心地將親生的骨肉拋棄。這時，平民婦孺醫院不得不代爲接生，看護，但是，由於育兒設備的尙付闕如，他們只能寄予着徒然的同情。該院服務五年多的吳榕瑛醫生吿訴記者說：「我眞不懂，上帝旣然愛每一個人，爲什麼讓人與人之問有這種貧富懸殊的現象？富有的人自己愛舒服，可以把孩子交給奶媽，但同樣爲人母的窮婦，却不得不咬緊牙關，忍心地拋棄親生的兒子！」</p>
<h3>社會服務　答復讀者</h3>
<p>法律質疑</p>
<p>（一）趙蘭芬問　編輯先生：我是個廿四歲的女子，從小未受敎育，在十八歲時憑父母之命，嫁給一個同鄉姓顏的，做汽車夫的，結婚甫經二月即吿失業，因爲生活壓迫，吾祗得去帮傭，我丈夫是個游蕩成性貪吃懶做的人，有時有幾個錢總在外面荒蕩，甚至數月不到家中一次，家中父母及一切開支完全不願，向他理論他就開口駡動手打，我只好忍耐回家，期待他覺悟，現在有幾個疑點，請代爲解决途徑：1丈夫不負担妻子的生活，是否可作離異的理由？2丈夫現在姘識一妓女，該女願將賣淫之資供他應用，雙宿雙飛，儼若夫婦，我是否可去捉姦？3夫妻離婚是否需雙方情願，可否單稱提起離婚？</p>
<p>〔傅况鱗律師答〕（一）如係惡意遺葉，仍在繼續狀態中，可爲請求離婚之理由；（二）可；（三）如夫妻之一方有民法第一千零五十二條所列各款情形之一者，他方得向法院請求離婚。</p>
<p>（二）陸忠禮問　（甲）男與（乙）女結婚已有七年，尙無子女，而（乙）女又有神經病，不能治理家政，今由親族介紹（丙）女與（甲）結婚，（乙）亦同意，幷得（甲）（乙）（丙）三方家長同意，若（甲）與（丙）結婚後，恐（乙）女向（甲）以重婚上訴，未知在法律生効否？若（甲）向（乙）以有神經幷不能生育爲離婚上訴，未知在法律上能否生効？</p>
<p>〔傳况鱗律師答〕甲男非與乙女離婚後，不得再與丙女結婚，至不能生育一層，不足構成離婚之原因。但乙女如有重大不治之精神病，則甲男得向法院請求與之離婚。</p>
<p>（三）劉俊民問　茲有某甲，數年前由友人之介紹，與乙女相識，惟未經過結婚手續，祇於某日邀集親友宴會，宣布與乙女結爲夫婦云云，現因意見不合，擬脫離關係，請問（一）此種結婚，是否合法？（二）如欲離婚，是否須請律師辦理合法手續？</p>
<p>〔傅况鱗律師答〕（一）如當時係有公開之儀式，及二人以上之證人，自可認爲合法之結婚。（一）如離婚係出於兩願，應以書面爲之，幷應有二人以上證人之簽名，此項證人幷不以律師爲限。</p>

<h3>假話</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>晚報上有這麼一段記事：</p>
<p>某日某會。來賓除各報記者外，有……及外國佳賓多人。雍容華貴，有穿玻璃絲襪者。該會首由×××女士主席致詞，×××女士演講後，由×××女士演講，謂處此生活高漲，災荒遍地，我等婦女，應首先提倡節約，……</p>
<p>「雍容華貴，有穿玻璃絲襪者」，「處此生活高漲，災荒遍地，我等婦女，應首先提倡節約」……讀起來頗感到不甚調和。</p>
<p>再看下文，我以為一定有「穿玻璃絲襪者脫去」，或「雍容華貴者面有慚色」，不知是否記者先生諭調，並沒有對此有所描寫。</p>
<p>曾聽到過這麼一個故事：有一位工人運動者坐在黃包車上，跺脚大駡車夫，說：你拉得這麽慢，躭誤我的事，你知道我是去參加工人大會的嗎？</p>

<h3>嘉陵江畔的夏天</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>蟬聲如溪澗裏的流水一般，細小纎長，從耳膜透入心內，無意中就有着一溜凉意潛流全身。</p>
<p>看見上海馬路邊的法國梧桐樹，翠綠晶瑩，淸嫩欲滴，便想留連片刻；可是閃電般的車子，與行人的擠擁，使我無法停下脚來。在這樣的時候，我便想起了去年在嘉陵江畔的夏天。</p>
<p>嘉陵江畔沒有從海外刮來的颱風，吹得使人幾乎睜不開眼睛。那邊夏天的風，像從天空撒落在盤地裏的飛絮，轉過山峽，掠過江面，再悠然地來到你面前，帶有豐腴的泥土香味，招喚你歸到大自然的懷抱裏。這時你眞是虛懷若谷——沒有一點煩思，沒有一點都巿物質的困擾，無憂無慮去領受風的凉意，和夏季的淸暢。</p>
<p>就在那排列着法國梧桐樹的長隄，你躺在一張四川式的竹椅上，獨自一人坐着，再沒有別人來打擾。從一些低矮的江樹空隙聞，望江裏的划子，牠們像你一般只任自然的力去支配，徐緩地叫風送去；一些黑色的大民船，由幾十個赤着肩膊的縴夫，匍匐下來，拉着長長的大纜，這樣你可以賞識杜甫的名句「遲日徐看錦纜牽」，並且也會羨慕他們謀生的毅力。</p>
<p>沒有冷侵舌本的冰捧，可是那茶館裏有沱茶。或北溫泉的甜茶，你可叫「小總」給你端上一杯；淸凉的香氣摻和淡淡的甘甜，這就是川地的名產。細細茗啜，你覺得比有刺激性的冰淇淋味妙得多。在都巿裏永遠找不到一間理想的咖啡店，但是你看到這江畔的簡陋茶館，三二個「川娃兒」忙着招應，雖然你坐得遠離茶館，也不用叫一聲，他們自然會殷勤地來替你時時酌得滿杯；你享受了品茗的淸福，然而並不覺得有坐茶館的空氣，這樣的心境與地方，我楊便是最理想的咖啡店了。</p>
<p>嘉陵江，永遠沒有像黃浦江的汹浪，也沒有充塞着的兵艦洋船。江中所有的川人稱為「洋划子」的江輸，不過是民生公司內航的小型輪船罷了。牠們掛着小小的旗子，從下流來，由上流落，像一把梳子，自由來去在江心。</p>
<p>悠長的蟬聲，可以從對江飄來，你吟哦着調子，可與這蟬鳴相應和。在都巿裏，那能聽到蟬聲呢？蟬聲如溪澗裏的流水一般，細小織長，從耳膜透入心內，無意中就有着一溜凉意潛流全身。</p>
<p>半天，待你看着梧桐的日影，已經斜延得瘦長了，三二隻歸烏，也掠影在江裏了，便可以慢慢回到臨江的小屋子去。</p>
<p>夏天川中的氣候，夜裏常常下雨。推開小窗，聽雨聲淅瀝窗前，擁起薄衾，你好像聽到誰人在低吟李商隱的名句：</p>
<p>「君問歸期未有期」</p>
<p>巴山夜雨漲秋池；</p>
<p>何當共剪西窗燭，</p>
<p>却話巴山夜雨時」。</p>
<p>好，現在我是寄居滬濱懷念着，「巴山」了。我想，那些在重慶歎「行路難」的人也大可以再留戀些時罷。</p>
<h3>記蔣經國</h3>
<p>— 韓天榮</p>
<p>炎日高懸在空中，汗珠瀑射似泉源。展望東北，迴觀贛南，一樣暑氣蒸人。低首沉思，年靑政治家蔣經國先生的影像，展現在我的眼前。</p>
<p>戰時，新贛南是一個東南大後方的樂園，許多流浪的靑年，都曾投入過她的懷抱；許多朋國的友人，也都願意在那裏度着他們異國的生活。三年前，筆者初臨贛南，並且以某一個機會，得與蔣經國先生共同度着兩個多月的暑期生活，學習了不少豐富的智識。</p>
<p>我並不强調，不誇張。正如他自己所說的，蔣經國是一個平凡的人物。結實的身體，不高不矮的個子，時常帶着黑色新贛南公僕的皮帽，穿着一身安安藍的制服，臉露笑容，或乘一輛脚踏車，或緩步地躑躅在贛州的街頭。</p>
<p>他沒有官僚的氣象，更沒有公子哥兒的脾氣。他熱愛着贛州，更喜歡和老百姓接近。在新贛南路專員公署的門口，沒有一般衙門那種森嚴荷槍的兵士，而代替的是兩個年靑徒手的童子軍？專員公署的佈吿，沒有公文程式中「等因奉此……」的字句，而代替的是通俗誠摯的大衆語言。這種作風，是要使一般民衆，澈底瞭解政令，並且親近政府，當然會發生偉大的效力。更同時，為了要避免蒙蔽起見，更訂定每逢星期三在專員公署定時接見民衆。那時，在新贛南的馬路上，扶老携幼絡繹不絕的人羣，都向專員公署的門口邁進。他們滿懷著希望，希望賢明的長官，能够替他們解決困難，昭伸寃屈。據筆者過去詢問的幾個例證，蔣經國先生確實是沒有開過空頭支票給他們。</p>
<p>贛州是靑年萃合的塲所，你可以看到無數的學生，急忙地奔走，走向各種學校裏去。蔣經國先生酷愛靑年，因此，贛州便成為流浪靑年的大本營。在那裏，不僅可以解決日常的生活，同時，在求學及就業方面，更可得到莫大的帮助，流浪者的心靈，受着仁慈的撫慰，異鄕的生活，也就不會感受着多大的凄凉。生活學校，虎崗，江西支團部都是流浪靑年的居所。筆者亦曾一度居住於蔣先生所設立的大學生寄宿舍內，親身享受他所給予流浪者的優待，「蔣經國是我的哥哥，也就是你們的哥哥」。曾經親臨過贛州的靑年們，都有和蔣緯國氏所說的一樣感想。</p>
<p>過去艱難困苦奮鬥的史實，使蔣經國先生鍛鍊成為一個堅毅實幹不畏强暴具有恒心的人。他在俄國的時候，因為沒有接濟，無處安身，於是就在垃圾桶內過着睡眠的生活。這種艱難困苦的情狀，沒有使他衰萎，相反地，更使他領悟着人世間的辛酸，奠定了他日後政治設施的基本觀念。他一面工作，一面學習，每日除了正常應辦的公事外，還要讀兩三小時的書籍，據最接近他的人吿訴筆者說：「他這種工作是沒有一天間斷過。」由此可以看見蔣先生的恒心了。</p>

<h3>名妓病故　嫖客送喪</h3>
<p>近日滬巿米價又見波動，黑巿流行，米行口稱無米供應，但相熟者詢之，則可以每担六萬六千元之價購得。吾人對此事之看法：可謂「野火燒不盡，春風吹又生。」</p>
<p>江西樟樹後街有一名妓女病故，於出喪之日，殯過街市，送葬者達三四十人，其中多屬嫖客。寥寥數語，可窺見名妓之生前景象，車水馬龍，門庭若市焉。</p>
<p>廣東遂溪縣城隍廟門前，有前淸文士陳喬森所題聯：</p>
<p>「那兒差役不是鬼，</p>
<p>這裏衙門不要錢。」</p>
<p>時至今日，我們讀之，似有各加「？」號一個之必要，文曰「那兒差役不是鬼？這裏衙門不要錢？」閻王好見，小鬼難當是也。</p>
<p>貴陽馬路上，人力車夫與馬車並駕齊驅的作競走比賽，我們對古老樸實的山民，表示十二分的同情，但是又想到「人獸之簡」的距離相差有多麽遠的時候，心頭不免又覺得莫名的傷感！</p>
<p>「長沙巿人力車夫數千人因為生意淸淡，全體出動搗毀行駛街頭的全部公共汽車，憲警開槍彈壓死傷十餘人」，這又是一幕有關人力車夫的悲劇，亦是現社會的一個矛盾的現象，古老的中國需要機械工業來復興建設，但古老的人民却需要以低賤的勞力來維持高生活壓迫下生命的延續。所以這次不幸的事件，我們祗認為是落伍者的悲哀！</p>
<p>偽天津市長溫逆世珍，經冀高院於二十四日判處死刑，孫推事晋音太重，溫逆當庭誤聽為四年或十年，於走出法庭時，面目紅潤，態度自若，問法警道「是四年？是十年？」，當時頗自得，法警吿以係死刑，始垂首無言。溫逆可謂聰明一世，糊塗一時，豈不知自作孽不可活耶？</p>
<h3>憶九龍坡</h3>
<p>— 陳循介</p>
<p>交大在重慶的校址</p>
<p>像我這樣一個喜歡淸靜的人，回到了這喧囂煩鬧的大都巿裏來，不免令我時常回憶起淸靜，美麗，可愛的九龍坡來！</p>
<p>九龍坡離重慶十多公里，在城的西面，有兩九公路直可以直達。如果從兩路口出發，假使車子半途又不拋錨，一小時許，你就會從迴旋的山路中，經過數度的迂迴曲折，上坡下坡之後，慢慢的看得淸白色的長江流水，當車到達最後一站時，這就是九龍坡了。九龍坡就在江邊，這裏，你以可以逗留在灘旁，看滾滾東流的江水，看來往不一的船隻，望對江李家沱的工廠，遠眺盤旋在天空中的飛鳥……</p>
<p>這裏是從重慶城裏到海棠溪，去貴陽的必經要道，九龍坡江邊就是個渡口，從淸晨起到天黑，打這里渡江的的吉普車，小汽車，和載重大卡車，每日不下數十輛之多。</p>
<p>其實，九龍坡的名稱，恐怕還是由於附近有個小鎭，名呌九龍舖的緣故。在這渡口附近，有着上下傾斜很大的山坡，這坡邊小站，就名之曰九龍坡了。說到九龍舖，有一二十家店舖，飯館，麵館，茶館，還有其他雜貨店，骯骴的街道，破舊的矮屋。在早晨，這裏是小榮塲，雨後的泥潭，這裏更顯得汚穢不堪！</p>
<p>在公路車上經過了楊家坪之後，不久你就可以從車窗中慢慢的望到一個小鎭。一轉彎間整個小鎭的面目就在你面前了。路旁僅有幾個店家，但這兒的空氣，比楊家坪活潑這鎭呌黃桶坪。從這裏再過去一站，就是九龍坡。換句話說，這是兩九公路的末二站，在鎭的馬路斜對面，就是抗戰期中國立交通大學的校舍所在！</p>
<p>（假如你已知道得很淸楚的話，那末，你就知道在黃桷坪下車走不上幾步，就可以到學校。不然的話，你準會一直乘到九龍坡，再回到走上一段路，才到學校。正確講起來，交大在黃桷坪，但是，或許由於九龍坡的名聲比黃桷坪來得大，只要談到九龍坡，也就知道是交大的所在地了。）</p>
<p>本來，這兒是個荒凉的地方，但自從交大遷到這裏以後，隨着也興起了這個小鎭，道兒，有的是飯店，麵店，茶室，糖果店，和香烟店。他們做的全是同學們的生意，在這裏，來來往往的差不多全是交大同學們，這裏是交大的小天地。</p>
<p>整個九龍坡，沒有沙坪壩學校區那樣的人多，所以也就沒有那樣的熱閙。這裏籠罩在鄕村的氣息下，淸靜，幽雅，美麗安閒是安心讀書的好地方，是潛心硏究的好處所。</p>
<p>公路就打校門前經過，過路的客人們，在翻過小小的山凹後，就可以看到整齊的屋舍。首先入眼的，恐怕就是黃桷坪，貼對面的工廠房；再前幾步，就是交大的，恐怕也是全九龍坡最漂亮的一座禮堂。它聳立在路旁，表現出抗戰期間交大屹立不動的雄姿，它表現出交大整個的精神，裏面有紀念唐文治先生的文治堂，可以容納近一千人。紀念週，名人講演，演話劇，開電影，都在這裏。同時，這裏也是交大的心臓，一切行政辦公所在地。</p>
<p>禮堂的旁邊，一排一排的平房，是同學們的敎室，禮堂後面，一行一行的，是同學們的宿舍，再後面，小土山上，是敎授們的住所，和女生的宿舍。整個的講起來，屋舍很簡陋，但整整齊齊一行一列，在晨熹和夕陽裏，分外顯出平房的美麗，這裏曾藏着中國一部分的精華，這裏曾是一千五百多個靑年學子攻讀地。</p>
<p>鋸齒狀的山峯，一層一層由遠而近。每當晴朗之日，可以望見滾滾東流的江水，襯託着凸凹不平山脚的土色·水·山·花·木·鳥·蔚藍的天空，浮動的烏雲。微風陣陣從田野裏吹來，你會懷疑到已經不在人間。</p>
<p>一到傍晚，這裏更顯得可愛。點點的燈光，在這漫漫的黑夜裏，伸展它無限的光芒，代表着這是九龍坡附近的光明！</p>
<p>夕陽裏，同學們三五成羣，邊談邊笑，信步馬路上。出校門向右走，可以到九龍坡，左走，可以去楊家坪。山谷裏吹來的微風，帶來了田野間自由舒暢的氣息，同時也送走了同學們終日的疲勞！</p>
<p>月夜，功課之餘，走出了宿舍，二三知己，徘徊於月光之下。懷念着祖國的山河，久別了的家園，一片月光山色，輕輕嘆惜，會振動到整個的空間。如果你有興致，月不同飲，互相傾談，躺在草地上，直到夜深人靜。</p>
<p>九龍坡想必沒有先前的熱鬧了，但月下山色，一定依舊。在這喧鬧的城巿裏，我時常回憶着九龍坡，回憶着抗戰數年中的生活，想起了美麗的九龍坡，同時也連想到整個美麗的中國。幽靜的九龍坡，雖然我已離開在數千里外的大城巿裏，我回憶着它，我愛它的平靜，世界上不易得到的平靜！</p>
<h3>被遺棄的上校</h3>
<p>— 川虬</p>
<p>聯合國發動侵歐之前，美軍源源不絕，輸入英倫三島，到處安營。有位美國上校，奉命巡視各處正在建築中的營房。他的車夫，乃是一位美麗的英國婦女輔助隊汽車運輸團的團員。他們所過之處，房屋均正在糾工興建，沒有一處完工。這位畫夫每到一處，留心找覓女子厕所，均撲了個空。一路行來，她不愉快的情緒，逐步增加。最後她再也忍耐不住，當他們歸返司令部的途中，她把車子停在道旁，囁嚅着「對不住」，走出車外，急行數百步，隱身樹林之中。數分鐘後，重復出現，兩眼直視地面，含羞低頭，走上車子，開動馬達，不發一言，直駛而去。等她駛了五十哩途程，到達司今部停車，她回頭一看纔發現那位陸軍上校却不在車上。三言兩語集</p>

<h3>乾嘉時代的豪貴</h3>
<p>— 曹作漢</p>
<p>在近來報紙上的國內新聞，除國共和戰問題外，公敎人員待遇問題，也似鬧得如火如荼。立法院之建議，依照物價指數，較之戰前的比例，也不過祗有十分之一，結果還未能通過。現在決定調整的數字，每月薪俸所入，買半担米還可够的，昔陶令不甘為五斗米折腰，則今日之官吏，似乎較昔日好些。</p>
<p>其實官吏待遇淸苦，也不自今日始。在太平天國外紀中有幾句說道：</p>
<p>「今日之支那政府，則以苛求勒索為常事。官吏俸給之小，令人聞之咋舌……則官吏如何生活乎，惟有勒索賄賂為生活耳。</p>
<p>當時的俸給，究竟如何的小法，然而能使人聞而咋舌，其小可知。但還有奔走營求的人在，蓋作官為吏，別有生財之道耳。偶憶抗戰以前，有天津藉之王某出宰吾邑，下車伊始，所有屬員，上自秘書科長，下迄門丁茶役，均予以調換，邑人好詣者，乃私謚之曰「王一團，」以其夾帶人物之多，可够一團之編制。為什麼如此作法，云係來此者均係「帶壯子」的，性質同於合夥營商，旣接着一票好賣買，大小股東自須分嘗一杯。一八六一年支那之友的支那政府之腐敗一文中載道：</p>
<p>「政府曰：來！張三李四，中舉人，中進士，奉獻爾金錢，吾與爾官爵。舉人進士一得官，則剝削聚歛；金多矣，再求升官；官升矣，再事剝削。官無大小，皆以是為生活。總督之下為巡撫，其俸給約五十金鎊，而歲入約四千三百三十二鎊，督撫均有生殺之權……」</p>
<p>這眞是一筆好買賣，可惜因此浪費作踐了多少民脂民膏！毋怪要有「三年淸知府，十萬雪花銀」的民謠了；結果表現於貪官汚吏的私生活之上的，是荒淫與無恥，奢侈的過份的享受。淸代通史中有一段寫眞道：</p>
<p>「一時飲食車馬，衣服玩好，莫不逞奇鬥巧，其奢汰有帝王所不能及者……某河督宴客，豚肉一篕，須斃五十餘豚，取其背肉一臠，餘悉棄之。食駝峯則一席需三四駝，鵝掌猴腦，亦務取精華。即豆腐一盤，製法亦有數十種……食品旣繁，一席之宴，恒歷三晝夜不能畢。」</p>
<p>吏治不澄淸，國貧民弱，國庫空虛，民不聊生，祗有貪官與奸商，才是得其所者的勝利者。互閹和珅罪露籍沒，其一己之財產，超過國庫十年收入之總數。國家與民衆，為他剝削榨取去的該有多少？</p>
<p>上引的情形，是乾嘉時的事，洪羊事變之原因，固有種族及其他之因素，不過因貪汚引起的民生問題，也是內中的一大主因。</p>
<p>當然，這時不同於乾嘉，然而亂匪之多，却猶勝於明末，望勿為叢毆雀，為淵驅魚，澄淸吏治與改善待遇，實均急不容緩了。</p>

<h3>演技中的體騐派</h3>
<p>— 葉子</p>
<p>這派的表演方法，我們可以從史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的「莫斯科藝術劇院」的作風中看出。這劇院是以表演為中心的，把演員看為劇塲藝術的基本和主要的媒介，劇塲為演員所據有，所享受，所轄治的，但他的主要信念不是專注意個人的創造表現，而是以集體表現為前題。</p>
<p>史氏創辦這個劇院的目的，是以「眞實」超越當時劇塲所逐漸成長的人工化的「外形」表演，他說那種誇張的風格，和一種人工設計的情感之表現是華美和虛誇的東西。在他的劇塲里，每個演員必須把自己放在主角地位，設身處地的去摹擬那角色，單獨的體驗內在的情感，導演只不過是幫助他們啓發而已。所以他們自稱他們的劇塲為「內在感情的劇情」。這劇院的風格的基礎是以單純性洗練獲得美的効果，以實質的佈景放在演員周圍，角色的情緒眞實而正確的摹擬。他的理想，據他說是「從劇塲中將假的劇塲趕出去。」</p>
<p>就為這個原故，在莫斯科藝術劇院的表現方面，比較其它劇塲更為苦幹，他們寧願趨於嚴肅，也不歡喜在鮮艷的裝飾和悅目的服裝上花費功夫。他們建立了一種內心的表演理論，當演員表演時要體驗角色，離開自己的意志，生活着他所扮演角色的生活，一切都做得自然而然的，不但把角色生活的外表表現出來，更主要的是把所表演人物的內心生活創造在舞台上，即史坦尼所謂的「情感的直覺」，要在外在的形式中，包含着一個內在的，極深入的意義。這角色的內心生活是靠演員內心的體驗過程造成的，把獨自的感覺活到角色的生活裏去，把靈魂注入到角色的特徵部份，成為個人生活的表徵，選擇那能够强調，消化種種心理的契機的自然主義的細部，對於一切事物給予心理的要素。由於這種原因演員比在實際生活中，須要更銳敏的感覺和更多的經騐。並且演員表演一次，就要這樣經歷一次。</p>
<p>當演員被他演的劇本完全抓住時，這工作大部份是潛意識的，是靠了人的機體的自然力量，假使機體是蠢笨的，便要用一種方法去刺激他，駕駛它，這就是技術心理學的方法，這方法就是使演員能够在自己的內部喚起創作的自覺，對於創作上的整個心理準備，要使演員在自已的內部養成舞台上的控制，創作的專念，即與平常興趣完全隔離的，心理感受性的獨自精神狀態，在開始創作前任何的精神準備都是不可缺少的。這要靠演員長久的修養，熱心的心理訓練而產生的，這種方法的任務是在於用意識間接的喚起潛意識去創造，也就是使演員內心生活的寫實，循着人機體的一切自然規則透露出來刺激潛意識，才能迸發靈感。所以有意識而正確的創造是潛意識，與靈感創造產生最好的基礎。史氏在「我的藝術生活」中說：「這並不是說我要以人為的方法創造靈感，那是不可能的，我所要求的是：如何能創造一個好的品質，能藉意志以表達靈感，有那品質存在，靈感便易于通過演員的靈魂。」</p>
<p>「意識的技術心理」就是發展這種創作自覺的能力，並解明創作內在的本質。正確的創造自覺，是因於所創造材料之正確的舞台信念有真實感。有如小孩之純真一樣，史氏說「正確的藝術真實」，可以使表演取消做作而產生形象生活的奇蹟」。創造是從演員的想像和幻想中引導出來的，這假定的想像一出現時，演員便能够產生比真實的生活更廣大的醉心而從心底置信牠。這樣便能產生舞台真實的動作，如果發現了劇本的「一貫動向」和「角色的核心」的時候，那末舞台形象也就應運而生了。這里所要注意的便是：都是向着一個根本的最高目的進行，角色便是這課題所分解的，演員必須將動作貫串起來，向着這個最高目的合流，將作者的潛伏意義與思想表示出來，他們便是這樣的，着重于硏討人的內在經騐與情緖。</p>
<p>只有這種的表演藝術才能完全抓住觀衆，使觀衆不僅明白就算完事，主要的是使觀衆體騐舞台上所發生的一切，豐富觀衆的內心經騐，給觀衆留下一個不能被時間磨滅的痕跡。</p>

<h3>上海話劇總評之四</h3>
<p>— 管玉</p>
<p>十·「萬世師表」</p>
<p>「萬世師表」是中電劇團到上海後的第一次演出。他們才眞正地把大後方的演劇水準介紹給了上海的觀眾。在這演出之前，有很多部隊劇團都打起了內地劇人的招牌在上海作多次公演，引起觀衆對內地劇人演技水準的懷疑，更使他們對內地導演的失望；自中電劇團的「萬世師表」上演後，才使他們眞正地認識了內地劇人最高的水準。尤其是對導演的處理感到十分的滿意。</p>
<p>「萬世師表」的編劇人和導演者，雖然是有着兩個不同的名字，但我們知道他原是一而二，二而一的一個戲劇家。他導演劇的時候，態度是非常的嚴肅，對演員的演劇路綫和演劇水準也有著控制的力量；所以，在他導演之下的劇作，是相當的完整和整齊。這已經在演出時為各界所公認。</p>
<p>「萬世師表」是描寫一個大學敎授如何堅苦地守住自己的崗位，敎導着一批靑年流亡學生，和領導着這批學生徒步遷校入滇。整整的二十五年，他沒有離開過自己的崗位。在他窮得再也無法生活下去的時候，曾有人勸他先打一點經濟基礎，但他沒有那樣做，他只是實地含辛茹苦堅守崗位。他的一生就這樣的貢獻給這偉大的事業，他不計眼前的和將來的報酬，只憑着「把自己的知識分給別人是快樂的」就已够了。</p>
<p>在這次演出裏，我們找不出一絲明星制度的存在，也沒有任何一個天才演員的表演在作個人發展！在這劇裏我們才眞正地看到了演員們的集體創作。因而有一個嚴肅而完整的藝術品給我們欣賞到。</p>
<p>在他本人編導的另一個戲「山城故事」裏，我們就看不到這樣完整的集體創作。我們知道劇藝的先知者曾經吿訴過我們，要把舞台上每一個演員都放在主角的地位去摹擬真實的人物，使整個演出的成功去代替一二個天才演員成功的明星制度。</p>
<p>所以，一個戲的演出上成功，並不是某一個演員的成功，而該是每一個演員的成功，也就是全體的成功。</p>
<p>「萬世師表」的成功，並不是某一個演員的成功，而是全體工作者的成功。</p>
<p>十一·「重慶二十四小時」</p>
<p>這也是中電劇團演出的劇目，在這劇裏，我們無法找到「萬世師表」演出中的任何優良的痕跡。所有的只是演出劇團的名字相同，除此以外，再也沒有一點中電所演出的氣息了。</p>
<p>在這劇裏所表現的現象，正是我們要打倒的明星制度。不可否認的，這裏能够充分的看到天才演員的畸形發展。他們可以不顧到人物的性格和真實的生活，用形式的技術來表演他們的角色。同時，他們對藝術的態度也並不顯得嚴肅，因為某一些事而引起他們笑的回憶，所以台上和台下打成一片，大家哈哈大笑。這，至少在這種演出是成問題的。但是，不能一概抹煞，他們在別的演出裏是比較嚴肅的，不過對人物性格的觀察和摹擬並沒有十分忠實地執行就是了。</p>
<p>劇作者在「重慶二十四小時」裏，加進了不少有趣的噱頭，它們只是重慶的人們才熟悉的事情；警如：電燈的暗下去一直到熄滅，然後又慢慢地發紅轉白而亮。屋外下雨屋裏打傘。這些，在重慶生活的人，沒有一個不親身經歷過的。正和上海人的一早去排班等着國軋戶口米和給敵人封鎖而受餓一樣的平常。因為劇作者這樣一寫，多少就帶了點地方色彩，有了地方色彩也就給地方性限制了。</p>
<p>但是，這劇寫的很緊凑，劇作者把時間，地點和動作都一致了，使所要發生的事情都在同一的地點，在二十四小時以內完成，這也就是我們所謂的「三一律」。</p>
<p>這劇的演出，我在不同的地點看到過五六次，但它們營業的成績，總超不出重慶的高度。</p>

<p>（六）色彩的調和</p>
<p>色彩之調和，完全是色彩對比後所引起的感覺問題。某幾種色彩在人目的感覺上是調和的，某幾種的配合，又覺刺目而不舒服。普通調和的色彩如：黃與藍，紅與藍，紅與灰，藍與橙，藍與黑，黑與白，橙與綠，黑與黃，白與紫，青與紅，黃與紅，紫與橙，橙與棕，白與藍，紅與白，棕與白等。在配合上，又須注意加白或淡以水的明調（Tint），加黑而成的暗調（Shade），及同時加白與黑的破調（Broken　Tone）。這可以使色彩調和的範圍更廣，獲得各種素質敎養及風土人情下的人生愉快之美感。</p>
<p>祥夫魯爾賞分色彩之調和為兩大類。第一類為類似之調和（Harmonies　of　analogy），此復有三種：以同一色階（即一種色彩之色値（Value）等差順序排列者之各光度相配合者，是為色階之調和；以鄰近色（如黃與橙靑與綠）色階上相同或相近之光度配合者，是為混色之調和；又以各種不同之色中有一色獨見顯著統屬餘色而為配合者，是為支配色光之調和。（此種調和與隔染色之玻璃觀物相同，一切物色皆變色，而有共同之傾向也）第二類為對比之調和（Harmonies　of　constract），此亦有三種：以同一色階中懸隔之光度相配合者，是為色階對比之調和；以鄰近色色階之懸隔光度相配合者，是為混色對比之調和；以甚異之色階相配合者，是為異色對比之調和。其與露斯京斐萊（Baily）各家之總，大都相同。蓋不外乎從變化中求統一也。</p>
<p>在第一類調和法中最應注意者，為「色相推移」（Gredation　of　Colour），自然界中之色彩如草木，昆虫，乃至天空等色，最多比種現象；即以同一色彩或類似色彩之光度淺深漸次，或隔越變化，而其對比明確，（各種光度之推移中可用較相隔遠之光度或細小空白以界開）調和之趣味為最高雅和平。換言之：即同色相的不同明暗與飽和，在任比例之下，都能求得和諧。</p>
<p>第二類調和法以用支配色光統一全體為主，其支配之主色或以面積，或以强度，而佔優勢。被其支配之色彩，則以在色環中距離九十度乃至二百二十度者為適合，以其隱含相同之色素也。至應用時宜加注意之點，更摘舉如次：</p>
<p>（一）色彩面積與明度應為反比例，且注意於全體之廣狹，以定其色彩之面積，務使得其均衡。</p>
<p>（二）二色配合，以近似補色者為美，但宜明度各別，此即各加灰色或互相加暗其色調，以成不飽和狀。其餘二色之配合有不適宜者，若改用不飽和色，亦可調和。</p>
<p>（三）三色配合，宜用兩種暖色，一種寒色，古來裝飾及繪畫，即皆帶暖色調。</p>
<p>（四）寒色之而積不宜過廣，不得已須多量用之，其色宜淡，然綠色則仍以少用為是。（希臘古代壁間裝飾，即無純粹綠色）。</p>
<p>（五）用黑白等色，宜注意光度上對照之變化。</p>
<p>（六）金銀等色祗可用作聯綫，其明暗應與底色相反。</p>
<p>（七）復雜之配色，可依美麗之自然物色。又蝶花寶石等之比例為之。又宜多用破色綢。最好就有一五色顯著，使全體有同一混色之傾向。（有時於全體中加一種色彩之小點或細綫，其效果亦同。）</p>
<p>（八）少用鮮明單純之色彩，使人自獲有較廣之地位。（自然界中最鮮明之色彩，莫過於花，然其面積特小，四週相襯托者多為暗色；又有明定相比，故使其色彩不至過於奪目，故無害美感也　。）</p>
<p>（九）用色之種類不宜過多（一色之各光度不論。）</p>
<p>除以上體積面積上的和階外，在感受時間的長短先後，及物理的現象上，亦各有不同。吾人習知，凡一切深色，均較淺色為重。如中國婦女之黑褲白衫，與西歐合唱隊之黑褲白衣，在感覺上均能使人舒適。蓋因重色在下，輕色在上之故，若反此物理，則必給人不和階之感覺。至感受時間之長短先後，則關係殘感現象。在彩色電影中，宜特別注意之。</p>
<h3>兩個笑劇</h3>
<p>— 陶熊</p>
<p>「陞官圖」和「新官上任」雖然在演出上不同，但它們的主題却是一樣的。前者是描寫一羣貪官汚吏，如何利用權力剝削着老百姓，如何向上級官長獻媚，甚至不惜獻出自己的妹妹和太太，去換得惟一的目的——升官發財；在同僚中則互相樹立廣織，排擠和傾軋！這些，只是現在政治舞台上官僚們的現形而已！後者雖然是描寫着一羣漢奸，但它們不是也在剝削着老百姓，向上級官長獻媚，和互相排擠嗎？不過，在他們這羣人的環境和身份上，沒有像「陞官圖」裏那樣的高尙和名正言順，雖然在「陞官圖」裏的縣長和秘書是兩個慣賊，但除他們兩人之外，不都是威風懔懔的官兒嗎？而「新官上任」裏，却是一羣無智識的流氓。這羣流氓雖然是在裝模作樣，想使自己做像一個真正的官兒，但他們到底是可憐的！因為他們不知該什麼做官，他們的「祖宗八代」沒做過官，所以連一張吿示上，都得把這些官兒們的姓名年齡藉貫，和住在那兒都得寫上去。當他們有一點事的時候，可以隨意開會，「肅立」着很像那麼一回事。一到雞來了，就可以為了一只紅燒一只淸燉而一哄散去！也不管這會的結果如何了。他們這種愚蠢的行為，使人可憐也可笑，比起那些「陞官圖」裏的官兒們要天真得多了。</p>
<p>「新官上任」裏的官兒們的貪污方法是販白面，賣雅片，這個向那個要月規錢；那個向這個是手頭沒錢，你有錢應該有福大家享！而「陞官圖」裏官兒們的貪汚方法是向老百姓派捐款；向下屬要金條治頭痛病，出少錢幾個錢要下屬代賣一隻五克拉的鑽戒。從這些上看來，愚蠢的流氓要比無恥的官僚爽直得多了。</p>
<p>這兩個戲都是陳白塵寫的。它們的主題都是寫官場中的形形式式，它們都是笑劇。因為劇作者寫作時的時代背景和社會環境不同，所以在同一的主題下，寫出了這兩個不同的作品來。由這一點我們可以知道，一個作者是離不開時代和社會的！</p>
<h3>羅振之　提倡崑戲</h3>
<p>— 羅振之</p>
<p>海上為人文蔚萃之區。各種地方戲劇，大致俱有，惟我蘇本境之崑班戲，獨付閩如。何以故？二十年來兵戈滿目，人心剛悍，所見所聞，無不趨於暴烈。故戲風漸變激刺，而樂府雅頌之音，不為世人重視。加之文化衰落，禮義幾亡，巿井呌囂，侯蟲訴秋，致南方仙霓，勢成渙散；北方僅存韓白，且韓世昌雅不願出而奏藝，專以授曲為生。崑伶至此，亦當嘆生不逢辰也！如梅蘭芳勝利登臺，即以崑劇當前鋒，有起衰挽頹之意。陽春白雪，半以提倡國學，半以陶冶人心；蓋曲詞婉美，感人最深，宜乎為高尙之娛樂，安可任其湮沒不彰耶！</p>
<p>傳奇劇本，均元明淸三朝知名之士所撰，往往幾度硏究，始能行世，其意義不脫忠孝義節，含有敎育本體，若竇娥含寃，六月飛雪，蒲鞋夜課，誥封雙冠，雖屬故意描寫，要知其勸善心切，感化良多，有裨世道。時至今日，科學昌明，人定可以勝天，而社會多事，奸詐欺盜，層見疊出，若能以劇風正人心，未始非說法之良箴！但其創演之初，有賴塲主善為調處而熱心引導焉！</p>
<p>京朝大角，梅·程·荀·尙·俱有崑曲根底，由此可知京崑兩劇之不可視為兩途，致分秦越之界，我願京崑兩劇打成一片，或京劇之演出中，夾以崑劇之節目，勿使崑曲絕跡於人耳目，而淡忘之。望愛好崑劇之士努力提倡，我願拭目以待崑曲之復興！</p>

<h3>計謀劇家司克利白</h3>
<p>— 大椿</p>
<p>十九世紀以前，歐洲的劇本，盛本計詩劇。到了十九世紀紀初葉，在法國雖有雨果掮起文學革命的旗幟，提倡爛漫主義，可是他那篇作爲浪漫派文學的序幕的名著歐那妮（Hernani），也是詩劇。直到司克利白（Augustin　Eugene　Scribe）起來，方始提倡白話劇，極受漢時社會的歡迎，誰都不敢與他分庭抗禮。還有一個原因，司氏所寫的風俗劇，憑了他抵曲折的構造，與豐饒的興趣，恰巧符合當時中產階級的要求。他這種改良的白話劇，當時的夫人劇院（Thetre　de　S.　A.　R.Madame）法蘭西喜劇院（Theatre　de　la　Comedie　Frangaise），國立歌劇院（Opera-Comique）等，都爭想排演，甚至影響及全歐。各國的劇塲，差不多也被司氏的著作　斷去了。</p>
<p>司克利白是一個商人的兒子，一七九一年十二月二十四日生於巴黎，一八六一年二月二十日逝世。生平單獨或與人合著了四百餘篇劇本，至少有三進五十篇曾經單獨刋行或收入各種文集。司氏是一位天才作家，在一八一五年，他的通俗喜劇國民軍的一夜（Une　nuit　de　la　garde　nationale）和幾篇生動的短劇，如謀事者（Ie　sollicitur）和能與總督（L'ours　et　Pacha）等發表後，即受文藝界的歡迎，一躍而爲名作家。自一八一一年起至一八六二年止，他的戲曲在各戲院公演了五十餘年，沒有一個法國劇作家像他那樣的被器重得如此長久。在樣式方面，他應用着喜劇（Comedie），活劇，（drame），通穀喜劇（Vaudeville），通俗傅廳劇（Mdlodrame）,歌劇（Opera），滑稽歌劇（Opera-Comique）等樣式。司氏最初的作品是獨幕的通俗的喜劇，稍遲才著作五幕的喜劇。司克利白是一位機敏精細的觀察家，對於當時社會上的風俗習慣，一一攝擴他底眼底。他的戲曲專注意於稱造方面，是以計謀（Device）爲前題，不如問題派劇本的專重詞令和意趣。司氏有神出鬼沒的手法，劇本的構造別出心裁，非常警關，錯綜複雜。起首往往平淡無奇，但是看到未了，竟可以使人拍案叫絕。他的一几一書，都是全劇的線索，可引起觀衆的興趣。劇情處處引人入勝，好似偵探小說，鬼起　落之點，又使人心蕩止昡。況且他能迎合羣衆心理，劇本帶着一種普通性質，文辭簡易可誦，好比白香山的詩，老嫗都能懂得。所以當時的劇評家稱他底戲曲爲妙品（Pieces　bien　faits）。後來的易　後和倍恩斯坦（H。Bernstein一八七年——）等都是他的私淑弟子。</p>
<p>一八二〇年，巴黎競技劇院開幕是起，到一八三〇年，司氏替該院編了許多通俗喜劇，用了極恰當的題材表現出來，內空豐富。這時期的作品，最好是一生中最好的日子（Le　puls　beau　jour　de　la　vie　）待據的小姐（La　Demoisrllea　marier）和幻術（Le　charlatanisme）等。司克利白的戲曲，主要的取材點沒有隱瞞：這些恰正給了中流社會所需求的快樂和理想。</p>
<p>司氏曾把通俗喜劇裏的幾篇主題，改編爲喜劇，得到了相當的成功。他底伐來利（Valerie），於一八二十年在法蘭西喜劇院上演，一八二七年該院又排演了他的金錢婚姻（Le　camaraderie），自一八三三年起至一八五〇年，他的作品經常在該院博得觀衆的侍佳評。這時期，該院曾先後演過他的倍良和辣東（Bertrand　et　Raton一八三三），友誼（Le　camaraderie）誹謗（La　calomnie　一八四〇），杯水（Le　verre　dieau一八四〇）和一條　條（Une　chaine一作四一）等等。</p>
<p>在一八一五年至一八四八年，法國戲曲的產後量，要算喜劇最多，間就金錢問題的劇本，在各戲院裏佔據了一個極大的增位：差不多所有的肉欲喜劇都傳染上了這個問題。除了司克利白抵金錢婚姻和自吹自唱（Le　Puff　一八四八）之外，較爲著名的有蓬助（C.Binjour一七九五-一八五六）著的金錢（L'argent一八二五），比加（L.B.Picad一七六九-一八二八）和安比司（AS.Empis　一七九五-一八六八）合著的投機事業（L'agiotage一八二六）。一八四八年之後，邦沙（F.Pinsaraent一八五三）和錢袋（La　Boursr一八五六）</p>
<p>自一八二三年起，司克利白又寫過許多歌劇和歡聚歌劇：白夫人（La　Dame　），　子（La　Muette　de　Portio　一八二八），大佐，男爵夫人，天真的少女，國民軍，帝政時代的老兵士，伶俐的官吏，捏造新聞的記者·爆發的商人·公證師·小職員等等，都是模範的人像，他簡直在人們眼前展覽了一部準確而動人的大畫冊。這些人物的衣署·動作·奇　·談話等待，轉來轉去。看了那些風俗　喜劇裏的人物，令人追憶起莫利哀·勒虐爾（J.-F.Regard　一六五五－一七〇九）·唐古（F.Dancour一六六一－一七二五）和僕馬　等大家的作品。並且，有時候司氏比他們表現得還要好些。</p>
<p>司氏有許多合作的朋友，他們祇幫助他找一點材料，供給一點意見。有一位名叫滿希（Carmouche）的合作人曾經說「我曾和司氏合作過十二篇或十五篇通俗喜劇，但是我老料告訴你，在這些著作裏，沒有一句話是我的。」司氏往往在合作人的東西裏選取幾個塲面，變換一下主題，把各部份緊湊起來，從頭至尾重寫一遍。合作的人也分得一半不到些的利益。</p>
<p>司克利白生平所著最好的戲曲要算倍脫朗東·杯水·女人的爭吵（Bataille　de　dames一八五一）·金錢婚姻和友誼等劇本。倍脫朗和辣東與杯水是二　歷史喜劇中的模範作品，筆調輕描淡寫失爲精美，純粹·連大促馬也得常常他。倍脫朗和辣東寫的是朗祚伯爵與司脫呂安賽的鬥爭。杯水寫的是英國馬巴路夫夫人和薄林勃洛克的鬥爭。司氏往往選擇那些冒險的或危險的題材。女人的爭吵一劇是描寫二個婦人間的競爭，去救護一　他們所愛的陰謀少年·那是一個政治的放逐者他會不會給人捕住？在這隱　的事件裏，在這搜索的行勸裏，在這嚴語裏，含着無窮的情趣。金錢婚姻裏的主人公是新道德結成的成累　心家的典型人物。一個少年貪戀着一位寡婦的金錢，沒有愛情，與她結了婚。在友誼裏的人物恰與巴　隆（B.Pailleron一八三四－一八九九）所著優伶（Cabotins）一劇中的典型人物類同，可是司氏的線條來得更爲明確。</p>
<p>除戲劇之外，司克利白還寫過許多長短小說，登戲於各日報及期刋，他底全集在一八五九年才開始印行。</p>
<p>司氏生平只顧寫作，並無其他的奢望。他的合作者巴耶（J.-F.Bayard）曾說「他是一個真起碼的作家，正如少數的作家一樣，有了這樣一個頭銜已經自滿了，不想再掮了作家的幌子去企求別的各種黨派裏都沒有他的大名，他不願從事任何革命，他不去召　任何有權勢的人，雖然其中也有他所崇拜的人。他不爲榮譽，地位和津貼折腰。他祇要求他自己，祇向他底才能和工作枯索，他有他的幸福和獨立自主……」</p>
<p>一八三六年一月二十八日司氏進了法蘭西學院。</p>
<p>佛依哀（O,Feillet一八二一——一八九〇）曾說：「在文學創造的領域裏最難的技術是去誘發想像，而不把想像傾棄，是去觸動心，而不去搗亂心，是去慰藉人們，而不是去賄囑人們；這種至高無上的技術是司克利白所有的。」</p>
<p>在一八六三年三月二十六日，法蘭西學院的會塲裏，費旦（Vitet　一八〇二——一八七三）也說過：「司奉承利白具有一種富強而優秀的才幹，保證他應得的地位，在這個時代，他握着戲劇界的牛耳，是音響事。他在戲曲上的發明天稟，可以說是前無古人……他底想像不是投在一只平常的磨子裏，他有他的秘奧，他有他的方法，從來不用同樣的方式來表現……」</p>
<p>自來寫劇，最難處理的昌結構，而司克利白的戲曲，已經克服了這上面的一節困難。在今日，司氏底作品雖然不裏　了，可是他那種精巧的構造，還有永存的價值。這是劇作家應該學學他的。我寫此文的目的，也就在這一點而已。</p>
<h3>霉（小说）（下）</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>當然他從没有受過妻子的錢。他懂得那是一種耻辱，他感到愤怒．可是他的愤怒的結果，僅是熨出一口長長的氣，便算了。</p>
<p>慚愧地說一句，有時候他圓直有些懊悔。譬如：逢到開會，看見楊克仁周大雄那理乳臭未乾的小子，統統穿起筆挺的西装，在幾個大肚皮校董面前敬煙攀談，他心裏總暗暗的懊悔未受下妻子的錢，否剧，那些大肚皮傢伙，至少也會不平常地看他一眼,或者来問他的尊姓大名，不致讓那班乳臭未乾的小子獨佔威夙</p>
<p>了。</p>
<p>那种懊悔的意思，目然是深藏在他心底里的。他徒不敢向任何人透露过，甚至也不敢向自己透露。然而他确实知通她是存在的，除了一些顽劣的学生趕着</p>
<p>他唤」綠帽子」的峙候，才是例外。</p>
<p>现在，他在淡淡的荣油燈光中着他的妻子，他又想起了這前前後後一切的事。但今夜似乎一切都有些異樣了。他心中只有一杯東西，——，情急！他眼面前只有一樣東西，——楊克仁的一張充滿冷氣的脆</p>
<p>——多可恶的女人！今夜還呼来假仁假義地拾俄一點安慰。匯要你的安感？爲了你的無耻，我的飯碗搖動了，你知道不知道？……</p>
<p>他心裹情急地呼喊着。他的拳頭幾乎衝到妻子白嫩的臉頰上。他覺得剛才妻子回来時，僅給她一聲冷笑和不理，真是太便宜她。他實在該像楊克仁說的：「那種女人，好好的給些颜色她看看！」</p>
<p>租越想越氣，越想越急。終於，他喉嚨裏矢去自制力地咸出一聲：「給丝顏色她看看！」</p>
<p>他喊得並不響。可是在寂靜的深夜，已够人吃驚了。他的妻子藩地睁開眼来，忘着他，奇怪奇怪的中問：「什麼事呀？」</p>
<p>他兇狠地望着妻子。從睡夢中醒米，她雨颊緋杠，顯得格外美麗。這魅力刺着池的眼，刺着他的心。他恨她。這一刹那，他清楚地觉得他恨也．他把握紧的拳頭徐徐舉起來。</p>
<p>然而不等他的拳頭落下去，妻子已徙床上跳了起来。</p>
<p>「不要打人，有話好好的說……」她抓住他的手，緋紅的騐頓在他的肩肿上，驚惶得舌堆都打了拮，鼓聲說着：「剛才回来，我就看出今失你不大開心，所以有一件很高興的事，我也不敢告訴你。……亡她哭了，眼淚滴到他我服上．她是一倘經騐豐富的女人，懂得眼淚能融软男人的心，尤其是像馮增褥那樣的</p>
<p>男人。</p>
<p>果然，他拳頭鬆開来了。像一個受满委屈的孩子向毋親訴苦，他把心中的愤急告訴了妻于。</p>
<p>「原來就是一也件事！你上當了，讓我来告拆你吧！……」聽完他的钻，他的妻子微微一笑、簡括地告訴他道：「新近有個小姊妹給我介紹了一個有錢的老頭子，是大　，也是你們學校裏最有力的董事。前幾天我托他提拔提拔你．池一口答應了。昨天他告訴我，說已同你們校長談過，下學期的教務主任一職，决請你一担任。大概楊克仁巴排悉這消息，所似今天想了計策来嚇你，挑唆你，要弄得你不成功，……</p>
<p>懂嗎？」</p>
<p>她沒有多說下去，僅輕輕問了聲：「懂嗎？」他點點頭。她又附在他耳邊說了聲：「我也使　是爲了你！」他又點點頭。於是一塲風波就算過去了。</p>
<p>過去了，夜越深，他在微弱的燈光下做了二個滿臉　　的老頭兒，摟着他妻子嬌小的身體，在他面前轉着，跳着，笑着。漸漸的，他面前又出現了許多熟悉的臉孔，有楊克仁，周大雄，張康元，王發奎，……啊！那些可惡的小子，竟一齊在向他吐唾沫，一齊趕着他喊：「烏龜！烏龜！」</p>
<p>好像一陳激怒，他的身體動了一動。可是刹時間，老頭兒和妻子都不見了，祇有昂立在那些小子面前。不！他似乎正悠閒地坐在教務室裏，穿着雪白的紡綢襯衫，淺灰色的西　，在同大塊　李校長秘密談話，談着合股到南京上海去走走　幫的事，一個瘦小的教員叩門進來了，穿着一件破　的藍布長衫，低着頭，他一看，喔，原來是楊克仁，「哼！」……</p>
<p>哼……</p>
<p>他笑了！張開眼睛，菜油燈　在一顫一顫地跳，他的心也一顫一顫地跳。</p>
<p>依舊是霉天，超市的熱風到處吹着開來、下學期的教務主任將換人了。</p>
<p>馮增壽和李校長談了話，幾十道奇異的眼光同時向他臉上想用來，他昂然地打這些奇異的眼光中穿過，昂然地捧着書本向教員室前走去。</p>
<p>他走得很　，瘦削的身體飄飄地，幾乎可以飛上天去。可以突然之間，他立定了，他的「昂然」小時了。他聽見前面六年級教室裏在團笑鬧，中間有一個很清晰的聲音：</p>
<p>「哈……馮先生的老婆給我爸爸匯覺，五千塊錢一夜，……哈……」</p>
<p>他聽得出那是張康元的聲音，他咬了咬牙，捏緊拳頭想衝進教室去。但忽然間，他的拳頭觸到衣袋裏一疊厚厚的東西，他的手鬆開了。他記起了早晨妻子把這疊東西塞到他袋裏時所說的話：「張老頭子說，下星期你們校東開董事會時，要給你介紹幾個，大亭，但你這副鬼相何見人？快今天先去定一身西裝再說吧！」想到這，他臉上頓時起了一陣熱辣辣的感覺；一刹時，他的全身都踴跟着熱辣辣起來了。</p>
<p>終於他揮着汗，小心地按住了袋裏那疊厚厚的東西，熱辣辣地跨過了六年級的教室。</p>
<p>悶，濕，熱，……天空裏掛着一轮　暗的太陽。……（續完）</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛　（六）（九）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>第二天，第三天的情形差不多，麗華的成績，一直被衆口稱讀着，麗雲則平平常常，不好，可也沒有大砸．因此三火以後，小姊妹俩都正式下了海。和戲團經理打了半年的合同，他們的名字暂峙仍排在第二三位上，以後再酌斟提昇。報酬麗雲每個月是廿塊錢，麗華每個月是四十塊錢。麗華收入不入不算多，可熄算達到了墨太太的目的，他們究竞在住家裏挣錢了。雖然，六十塊錢裹而還要分給張弦十二塊錢，（這是常彻講好的條件，徒弟登合以後，師父得從徒弟的包銀項下，抽取百分之廿率。）而且墨太太爲了希望他們有更大的成京所以仍舊叫他們繼續地學戲，墨太太年前許過張弦，今年增加學費爲每月四十塊錢，這樣以來，他們掙來的這　錢晃眼全部貴于了張弦。好在張弦爲了表示慷慨，免了替他們拉胡琴的報酬，但他聲明，這只是一個目前過渡時斯的幫忙，等到他們慢慢地熟稔了，舞台经騐稍稍豐富一點，別的人拉胡琴也一個樣能夠唱了，那時候他便　不再替他們帮忙了。如果非他拉胡琴不可的話，就是另付報酬，這個賬在墨太太的心裏盤算一番以後，她依然很樂觀，爲了她女兒的藝術，甚而她將不惜再花一筆錢雇張弦爲麗華的固定琴師。因爲她始終覺得：要賺大錢，必須捨得報酬，她看準了麗華的前途無限量，她花的這堆洋一，是約不會落空的　　致于麗雲，她是順手人情，而且代翁二太太培植麗雲，將來對于自己也還是有利的。墨太在確不失爲一個聰明的人物，她凡事都看得遠；有眼光和心胸，敢作；敢爲；能狠；能辣！</p>
<p>墨太太的預料果然不錯！麗華的藝術聲譽，一天比一天大起來；觀衆們因爲她人小才高，都很喜歡她，漸漸地居然有些觀衆給她送起捧場的禮物來了；也有人專誠到後台去看她的；還有不少太太小姐們爲了愛她；接她到他們公館去玩兒的。這一切都讓墨太太狂喜，也讓張弦和翁二太太，石玉樓等眼紅。</p>
<p>又是只有麗華漸不在乎！她麻痺地承受一切，她無動于中地把一切看成過眼的煙雲。她的戲碼近來也有了變化，除了她獨立主演的幾　戲以外，還常常加了石玉樓主演諾基亞產戲似乎更精彩些，會博得較多的掌擊。于是這情形，多少引起了石術樓不安的感覺，但石玉樓並不怨恨麗華，只爲自己市區的黃金時代哀悼！</p>
<p>歲月是不饒人的，石玉樓便　在這無情的歲月飛馳中，逐漸被遺棄！他的身心，也逐漸跟着被遺棄的生命；灰黯；消沈；以至于死滅！</p>
<p>同時，麗華在飛馳的歲月中成長，進步！</p>
<p>翁二太太因石術樓而悲苦，墨太太因麗華而快活！</p>

<h3>Ceasefire Deadline Expires Today at Noon; Chairman to Issue Important Proclamation; Tripartite Committee to Meet This Morning for Final Decision; Ma, Hsu, and Chou May Fly to Northeast Together</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th Morning, 3 AM] It is heard that Chairman Chiang will issue an important proclamation tomorrow morning regarding the outcome of the peace talks. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang convened a dinner gathering at the military academy residence around 7 PM this evening, inviting key government officials such as Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, Hsu Yung-chang, Yu Ta-wei, Wang Shih-chieh, Shao Lizi, and Chang Li-sheng. It is said that after listening to reports from various parties, the Chairman discussed the current situation with the committee members. Latest news tonight indicates that the Military Tripartite Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow morning to make final decisions on the Northeast ceasefire, resumption of transportation, reorganization and integration of troops, and Ambassador Ma's arbitration authority. If a full agreement cannot be signed, the already decided portions will be signed, and a joint announcement will be issued by both sides. The situation is improving due to Chairman Chiang's forbearance for the sake of the nation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] The Central Propaganda Department is preparing to issue an important announcement within the last hour of the ceasefire deadline tomorrow, or within two hours after the deadline. The content of this announcement may be a prelude to comprehensive peace, a reservation for comprehensive peace, or an agreement for partial peace, depending on the attitude of the CCP within ten hours after midnight tonight. According to Deputy Minister Xu of the Central Propaganda Department, who jokingly told our reporter this evening: "Please rest assured and sleep well tonight, reporters. Please come tomorrow to hear good news. Although tomorrow is a weekly holiday, the Central Propaganda Department will still be open as usual."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] The third ceasefire deadline expires at noon tomorrow, marking another expiration. However, as of 11 PM tonight, partial issues within the troop reorganization plan have yet to be agreed upon. It is heard that this morning at 10 AM, Minister of Communications Yu Ta-wei met with Ambassador Marshall, but only spoke for about twenty minutes before departing. Ambassador Marshall then, at 11 AM, brought his revised and supplemented troop reorganization plan from last night, along with the CCP's supplementary opinions on the plan, to pay respects to the Chairman. They held earnest talks for two hours, and he only returned to his residence at 1 PM. Colonel Cooke also visited Zhou Enlai at 11 AM this morning, discussing for one hour. After the meeting with Cooke, Zhou hurriedly went to Marshall's residence at 2 PM to hear the results of Marshall's morning meeting with the Chairman. He considered accepting Marshall's advice and sincerely consulting with the government on the troop reorganization issue to resume the Military Tripartite Committee meetings. It is heard that the discussions continued until 6:30 PM, but no concrete results were obtained.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] It is learned that if the compromise plan proposed by Ambassador Marshall is agreed upon and signed by both parties, Ma, Hsu, and Chou of the Military Tripartite Committee may fly to the Northeast together to facilitate a comprehensive ceasefire within the Northeast border to facilitate negotiation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] According to the CCP side, the CCP has made the following concessions in the troop reorganization: (1) The CCP has given up its demands regarding the proportion of troops. (2) The current situation in Harbin can grant the government a significant "advantage." (3) The CCP garrison in the Rehe, Chahar, and Northern Jiangsu regions can make concessions as much as possible in terms of locations. The above opinions are the content of the four-hour discussion between Zhou Enlai and Marshall this afternoon. Marshal Marshall originally planned to visit the Chairman tonight, but it was canceled because the records had not yet been fully translated. They should be able to meet and talk tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] It is heard that the government's counter-proposal to the troop reorganization plan, regarding Northern Jiangsu (including Northern Anhui), Rehe, Northeast, and parts of Shandong, hopes that the CCP can withdraw completely. This plan is the defense zone system that the government has consistently insisted on based on the demands of the people in various regions. According to Shao Lizi, who returned from Chairman Chiang's residence, most of the issues have been agreed upon, and only the parts within the Guannei region remain to be discussed.</p>
<p>Compromise Plan Contents</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Today, the government and the CCP spent the entire day discussing the transitional measures in the troop reorganization compromise plan proposed by Ambassador Marshall yesterday. It is heard that this method has adopted some of the CCP's opinions. If this plan can be agreed upon before 12 AM tonight, it is hoped that the tripartite meeting can be reopened within the last six hours of the ceasefire period, and the two sides will sign at the end of the meeting and issue a public announcement immediately. However, the government has many difficulties in accepting this method and is currently making final considerations. The following are the main points of the content of the compromise plan proposed by Ambassador Marshall:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the issue of stationing locations, both sides' troops should return to the state before the Northeast ceasefire order was issued on June 7th. (2) The government peacefully receives the three major cities of Harbin, Qiqihar (one says the CCP will not withdraw from Qiqihar for the time being), and Andong, limited to administration. When administrative personnel go to receive them, the CCP troops should withdraw to areas thirty or fifty miles outside the city. (3) All troops stationed on major railway lines should withdraw to designated areas to avoid conflict and restore transportation. (4) Both sides' troops should quickly reorganize and integrate to save expenses and must not arbitrarily conscript or expand their forces. (5) The reorganized troops will all be national troops of the Republic of China and enjoy all the treatment of national troops. (6) All parties and groups should withdraw from the military. After an agreement is reached, the KMT and CCP will formally sign an order for a nationwide ceasefire and quickly restore national transportation. (7) Once the military issues have concrete results, the reorganization of the National Government and the convening of the National Assembly will be implemented, a constitution will be formulated, constitutional government will be implemented, and "nationalization of the army" and "democratization of politics" will be achieved. However, the three parties involved have not confirmed this plan. It was unilaterally spread by people close to a certain party, and it is heard that the CCP has expressed agreement with this transition method because the above method is extremely beneficial to the CCP.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] Dagong Bao reported today that the CCP has expressed approval of all the suggestions in Marshall's troop reorganization compromise plan. The government still insists that the Communist army should withdraw from all ports in Shandong, major cities and railways in Rehe and Chahar, as well as northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu. According to the CCP, the Communist army wants to withdraw from a portion of the above-mentioned areas, but the government must not abolish the political systems, economic plans, and other policies established by the CCP in those areas.</p>
<h3>Various Circles in the Capital Had Frequent Contacts Yesterday; Shao Lizi and Wang Shih-chieh Visited the Chairman; and Held Discussions with Mo Dehui and Others</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Today is one of the most tense days of the peace talks. Frequent contact between various parties shows that the negotiations have reached a final juncture. At 9 AM, government representative Shao Lizi visited Wang Shih-chieh with Liang Shuming and Huang Yanpei to discuss matters. At the same time, Zhang Junmai and Luo Longji of the Democratic League visited Special Envoy Marshall. At 4 PM, Shao Lizi hosted a tea party at the National Assembly Hall, inviting representatives from various sectors of society, including the Youth Party and the Democratic League, to exchange opinions on the current situation. Representatives from all parties believed that the ceasefire deadline was approaching, and within this short period, they all hoped that various issues could be agreed upon, and looked forward to making the greatest efforts to achieve true peace. During the tea party, Shao Lizi first reported on the recent negotiation situation. Liang Shuming, Zhang Junmai, and Luo Longji then reported on their conversations with Zhou Enlai and their visits to Marshal Marshall. All representatives hoped to know the details of today's negotiations. Zeng Qi and others suggested that Liang Shuming, Mo Dehui, and others be selected as representatives to visit Zhou Enlai at 8:30 PM, while Shao Lizi and Wang Shih-chieh were requested to visit Chairman Chiang to report on the negotiation situation and present the opinions of the three parties' representatives. At 10 PM, representatives from various parties gathered again at Mo Dehui's residence, requesting Shao Lizi and others to report on the intentions of the government and the CCP, and to exchange opinions.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Shao Lizi and Wang Shih-chieh visited the Chairman at 8 PM tonight, and then went to Mo Dehui's residence at 11 PM for a meeting. According to Shao, regarding the issue of war and peace that the people of the whole country are concerned about, he can inform reporters: "There will definitely be no fighting tomorrow." As for the unresolved issues, only the inland portion of the troop stationing issue has not been agreed upon, but most issues have been resolved, and the government continues to make the last and greatest concessions.</p>
<h3>The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense Officially Begins Operations</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense has officially begun operations. It is heard that after the political departments of various military divisions and regiments are changed to news departments, they are all subordinate to the chiefs of staff of the respective levels of troops and are listed as the military's staff organization. Their status is the same as that of guest officials, and their mission is primarily to promote culture in the military.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Representatives in the Capital Issue Declaration on the Situation; Advocate for the Government to Sanction the Civil War</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] [Changli News Agency] reports: Due to the CCP's repeated delays and lack of sincere remorse, as well as inciting ignorant masses and advocating anti-Americanism, today is the deadline of the ceasefire, and the negotiations still have no concrete results. Recently, representatives of the National Assembly in the capital held a meeting and issued a solemn declaration on the situation, titled "Our Opinions on the Current Situation," jointly issued by Qi Qi of Suiyuan and Shen Lingxiu, representatives of overseas Chinese in Honolulu, and signed by more than sixty people. They advocated for the government to sanction the civil war and protest to the Soviet Union for its actions in fueling the civil war. Furthermore, National Assembly representatives Deng Gongxuan and Zheng Xiangchou told reporters that they believed that the opinions expressed in this signed statement were what the people wanted to say, and there were no partisan biases.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 29th] More than ten cultural groups in Hangzhou jointly issued a declaration on the situation on the 29th, which included "The CCP does not want the Republic of China, only its socialist 'motherland.' The CCP has been revolutionizing for more than twenty years and has discovered that this path is impassable, so it has taken a roundabout turn, saying that communist revolution is the highest goal and democratic revolution is the lowest goal. The CCP's killing, arson, besieging cities, seizing land, and even betraying the country and acting as a traitor, all have a set of theories. One day, if the country is destroyed and the race is extinct, the CCP will still say 'For the world revolution, this sacrifice is worthwhile!' The Kuomintang is not without its shortcomings, but the obstacle to peaceful unification and democracy lies in the CCP, etc." Furthermore, the editorial of the local newspaper today, titled "The Remaining Thirty-Six Hours," accused the CCP's counter-proposal for troop reorganization as an empty and impractical counter-proposal, and called on compatriots and third-party figures across the country to make fair and reasonable judgments and make strict demands.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 28th] The Sichuan Provincial Assembly recently sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, the main points of which are as follows: The CCP violates discipline, betrays trust, rebels with weapons, demolishes transportation to obstruct rehabilitation, and conspires to secede and undermine unification. This time, your graciousness has issued a clear order to extend the ceasefire, showing your eagerness to seek peace. However, the CCP is still capricious and has no remorse. The flames of war are spreading, causing turmoil throughout the country and worrying friendly nations. This assembly witnesses the overall situation and is deeply concerned. It deeply knows that after eight years of bloody war, the fruits of victory have just been reaped. If we continue to be tolerant and retreat, it will inevitably lead to destruction. Therefore, after a general meeting, it was decided that after the expiration of this extension of the ceasefire, if the CCP still acts against orders and disregards the nation's destiny, we earnestly request that you make a decisive decision, quell the internal chaos, relieve the people's suffering, permanently establish peace, and maintain the fundamental interests of the country. The assembly hereby represents 70 million people as the government's staunch support.</p>

<h3>With Unsettled Hearts Inside and Outside the Guannei, Three Groups Depart for Mediation; Yesterday Departed for Qingdao, Shuangcheng, and Tao'an</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 29th] The weather in the north today is gloomy and sultry. The ceasefire deadline is approaching, but reports indicate that the negotiations in Nanjing are still far apart, affecting people's hearts and causing unrest. However, there are three groups inside and outside the Guannei that set out for their respective posts this morning. One is the Qingwu Group newly dispatched from Peiping to mediate conflicts near Qingdao. The other two groups, 35 and 36, departed from Changchun, one to Shuangcheng County south of Harbin, and the other to Tao'an (Baichengzi) in Nenjiang Province. Originally, the Government side of the Northeast Forward Command Post of the Military Mediation Department requested that two groups be sent to Harbin and Qiqihar. The Communist side disagreed.

The only thing is to implement them in Beili and us. According to military sources, the Communist army has increased its troops in Harbin and Andong, and the national army is also preparing accordingly. There are also many rumors among the people, and the general situation is very tense and on the verge of breaking out. In addition to looking forward to good news, the people of the Northeast hope that the sun will no longer turn on this precious day.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 29th] Lieutenant Colonel Glenn, the new American head of the 15th Ceasefire Group of the Military Mediation Office, and his team of six translators arrived in Qingdao by plane from Dexian on the 20th.

<h3>Acheson Issues Statement Explaining U.S. Aid Policy to China, Aims to Achieve China's Unification</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 28th dispatch] Acting Secretary of State Acheson stated the following at a press conference today, regarding the issue of U.S. aid to China: Recent news reports from China indicate that some Chinese individuals have misunderstandings or distortions regarding the goals and policies of our aid to China. The various actions taken by the U.S. government to assist smaller countries are merely steps to complete the aid program to China. This program was agreed upon long ago, and its purpose is to help the entire China eliminate the various effects caused by the long-term war against Japan. These steps should not be interpreted as supporting any military factions of any party within China. Our actions cannot be fully realized in the short term. Their goal is to create, not destroy, the unification of China, and to encourage Chinese people to resolve their domestic problems through peaceful agreements and democratic means, rather than resorting to force. In this regard, we may as well cite the President's public statement on China policy on December 15, 1945, in which the President stated: "As China moves towards peace and unity, the United States will be prepared to assist the National Government in rebuilding China, improving the economy of agriculture and industry, and establishing a strong military organization within all reasonable limits, so that China can fulfill its responsibility for maintaining peace and order at home and abroad."</p>
<p>Assisting China in Training a Modern Army</p>
<p>There is currently a bill in Congress to assist the Chinese government in forming a moderately sized modern army. One of the main objectives of this legislation is to provide China with practical assistance in fulfilling the agreement reached in Chongqing on February 25 of this year regarding the reorganization and unification of China's armed forces. This agreement stipulates that a non-political national army be formed by drawing from the existing Communist and Central armies. Many measures to assist China will require a considerable amount of time for negotiation, agreement, legislative action, and finally, a decision by the President based on the circumstances at the time.</p>
<p>Resolving China's Economic Crisis</p>
<p>The above steps will inevitably take a long time. For example, the military aid to China bill currently being debated in Congress will take more than a year, and if any obstacles are encountered at any particular stage, there may be significant difficulties in continuing. The recent oil pipeline loan agreement with China has attracted much attention. This agreement totals approximately US$58 million. This agreement is, in fact, a formal procedure for the understanding reached between our country and China shortly after Japan's surrender, at which time it was agreed that China could purchase leased materials already in production or en route to China. Various measures to provide economic assistance to China in the form of materials and loans are impartial efforts by the United States to resolve China's severe economic crisis and prevent financial and economic collapse. The U.S. government hopes that the economic assistance we provide will be administered by a government that fully and fairly represents all major political parties in China (including the Communist Party). The U.S. government feels that it should postpone implementing economic aid until all political parties in China work together under a unified government. If we are stingy and do not provide even this minimum level of economic assistance, the result may be a crisis of economic collapse, plunging the general population of China into eternal suffering.</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie Reports on Administrative Situation: Zhejiang's Security is Assured; Seawall Project to be Completed in Mid-July</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th dispatch] Zhejiang Chairman Shen Honglie, on the afternoon of the 29th, hosted newspaper reporters and reported on the recent administrative situation: (1) Chun'an, Sui'an, Zhuji, Pujiang, Xiaoshan and other counties have all reported floods. Personnel have now been dispatched to conduct investigations in conjunction with the staff of the Executive Yuan, to provide clothing and food relief, and to complete repairs as soon as possible. According to reports, the current floods are due to years of deforestation, so future afforestation work is of utmost importance. (2) On the issue of security, an agreement has been reached with the Pacification Headquarters. National troops will be responsible for the main roads and waterways, while the special commissioners and county magistrates of each district will be responsible for the designated areas. Provincial security forces will eliminate bandits in bandit-controlled areas. In areas where two provinces intersect, the two provinces will dispatch teams to jointly suppress bandits, under the command of personnel dispatched by the Pacification Headquarters. Ammunition has been requested from the Ministry of National Defense, and the province will allocate 30 million yuan to each county for financial support. Chairman Shen also analyzed that banditry is due to a mixture of demobilized officers and soldiers, guerrillas, and puppet troops. A separate law has now been formulated for each county to accept disbanded soldiers and vagrants. Those from other provinces will be sent by the Pacification Headquarters to Teng County, and then repatriated to their original provinces by neighboring provinces. Those from this province will be stationed to reclaim wasteland along the coast.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th dispatch] The Shanghai-Hangzhou highway leading to the seawall has not yet been repaired.

<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] The Capital High Court is currently investigating Zhou Xuechang, the puppet mayor of Nanjing. Citizens have filed hundreds of complaints with the High Court accusing Zhou of crimes, some of which were forwarded from the Chairman's complaint box. As of noon today, the following four crimes of Zhou have been found: (1) In the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he colluded with Tian Jingbo, the chairman of the puppet sugar industry association, to secretly deduct dozens of packages of rationed sugar. After being exposed by newspapers, he was forced to distribute the sugar, but there were still instances of bribery such as selling and swapping the packages. (2) He privately used public funds from the puppet municipal bank for speculation in gold and stocks, and for high-interest lending. (3) He used the power of the price evaluation council to collude with the president of the puppet chamber of commerce, bribing reporters before being allowed to raise prices. (4) He hoarded more than 36,000 bundles of salt, speculating and driving up prices, causing a salt shortage in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] Jiang Zhengxiang, who was previously reported by the Nanjing City Council to have committed treasonous acts and automatically relinquished his position as a representative of the National Assembly, was recently found by the City Chamber of Commerce to have borrowed 300 million yuan in puppet currency from the Clearing Office of Puppet Financial Institutions last year under the pretext of being a preparatory member of the City Chamber of Commerce, which has not yet been repaid. The Clearing Office is urgently awaiting closure, and the City Chamber of Commerce has demanded that Jiang repay the money. It is said that the internal situation of this case is extremely complex and involves a wide range of people.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Suzhou, 29th dispatch] Zhang Beisheng, the puppet Jiangsu Civil Affairs Director and Commissioner of Northern Jiangsu Clearance, was re-tried and concluded by the Jiangsu High Court. The judgment was announced in the first court at 3:00 PM on the 29th.

Upon hearing the verdict, Zhang's face turned white and his hands trembled slightly. He wanted to argue, but the court stated that if he did not agree with the verdict, he could submit reasons within ten days to request a retrial.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Suzhou, 29th dispatch] Tao Shousun, a well-known gangster in Suzhou, had close relationships with enemy intelligence agents and puppet army commander Ni Pucheng during the enemy and puppet period. He used his power to arbitrarily dominate the countryside and harm the local people, and his traitorous actions were obvious. After the victory, he fled to Shanghai. Recently, Guo Dazhang, a soldier of the 202nd Division of the Youth Expeditionary Force's Sixth Army, accused Tao of relying on his power to forcibly buy his ancestral house and requested a thorough investigation to protect property rights. The original accusation also implicated Liu Genghua, a member of the Wu County Provisional Council, for colluding with him. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has now secretly ordered the Wu County Government to handle the matter and report back, and to not be lenient.</p>
<h3>Sun Yat-sen's Internal Organs Were Burned Long Ago; Zou Lu Denounces Chu's Absurd Claims; Ministry of Health Has Telegraphed Beiping for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] Regarding the reasons cited by the traitor Chu Minyi for requesting a retrial, such as the claim that the puppet government sent him to Beiping in the 31st year of the Republic (1942) to negotiate with the Japanese army to retrieve Sun Yat-sen's internal organs and enshrine them in the mausoleum, Committee Member Zou Lu told reporters that this matter was bizarre. Recalling that after Sun Yat-sen passed away on March 12, 1925, when an anti-corrosion operation was performed on the body at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beiping, Sun Yat-sen's family members, including Madam Soong Ching-ling and Mr. Sun Fo, were all inside the operating room. I and the comrades who accompanied Sun Yat-sen to Beiping were all waiting outside the operating room door. When the operation was completed, the doctor announced that the internal organs had been cremated by electric fire, stored in a bottle, and then placed in the coffin. At a central government meeting the other day, Mr. Sun Fo explained what happened that day. Mr. Zhan Jitao also said that this matter was rather strange, and it was decided to have the Ministry of Health investigate the doctor who performed the operation that day and confirm it further in order to dispel the absurd claim. Minister Jin Shunshan also said that he had telegraphed personnel from the Ministry of Health stationed in Beiping to be responsible for investigating with Peking Union Medical College Hospital.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Planning Committee to Hold Meeting to Discuss Five Important Issues; Subcommittees to be Established for Regular Economic Research</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] The first meeting of the Planning Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been scheduled to begin on the afternoon of July 1st and end on the afternoon of July 5th. There will be two sessions each day, morning and afternoon, for a total of nine sessions. The agenda is arranged as follows: the first and second sessions will discuss the policy outline of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the 36th year of the Republic (1947); the third session will discuss ways to rescue the industrial crisis; the fourth and fifth sessions will discuss the review of economic regulations and economic administration; the sixth and seventh sessions will discuss the issue of prices; the eighth session will discuss the coordinated development of state-owned and private enterprises; and the ninth session will discuss improving international trade facilities. At that time, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will personally attend and give instructions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] The first meeting of the Planning Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is about to open. Reporters interviewed Deputy Minister Xiao Zheng of the ministry to inquire about the significance and content of the meeting. Deputy Minister Xiao stated: The Ministry of Economic Affairs previously considered holding a national economic conference, but in view of the current inconvenience of transportation and the busy work of the heads of various regions, it was decided to establish this Planning Committee to hire economic experts and senior ministry officials to engage in regular research on current economic issues, as an important reference for the ministry's policies. In addition to holding plenary sessions whenever necessary, the committee will also establish subcommittees to regularly study temporary and special issues. As for the main topics of discussion at the first meeting, it can be reported that there are approximately five items: (1) The policy direction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the 36th year of the Republic; (2) The improvement of economic laws and regulations and administration; (3) How to coordinate state-owned and private enterprises; (4) The encouragement and protection of industry; and (5) The issue of stabilizing prices. Many of the above major issues involve matters beyond the authority of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, so the meeting plans to invite personnel from relevant ministries and commissions to participate and discuss them together. It is hoped that this meeting can formulate a relatively complete plan for the current economic situation, and use this economic policy as a pivot to contribute to the government for adoption and implementation. In addition, the reporter asked: There are rumors that Premier Song and Deputy Premier Weng had a certain economic plan that was submitted to the committee for discussion. Is this true? Xiao denied it, saying only that the Central Design Bureau had drafted a plan for opening up the state-owned enterprise system in January of this year, but this is not the main topic of discussion for this Planning Committee.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Importance of the Trieste Port Issue</h3>
<p>Since the reopening of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, more than ten days have passed in the blink of an eye, but the conference still has not made any progress. Although several agreements have been reached in the meantime, such as the return of the Dodecanese Islands to Greece, the convocation of the European Peace Conference still seems increasingly bleak due to the failure to reach agreements on several key points of the peace treaty. Among these key points of the peace treaty, the redistribution or transfer of land is naturally a crucial key. The two sessions of the Foreign Ministers Conference, and the two sessions of the Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference convened for the sake of the Foreign Ministers Conference, still have a great distance to overcome in resolving these territorial issues. Without reaching an agreement on these territorial issues, it would be almost impossible to conclude a peace treaty and convene the European Peace Conference. Among the issues concerning the redistribution of these territories, one of the most important is the Trieste port issue. Not only has no agreement been reached on this issue to date, but judging from current indications, the opinions among the four powers are growing further and further apart, appearing to be the main dispute of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, demonstrating its importance.</p>
<p>Trieste is a port on the northern shore of the Adriatic Sea. Before World War I, it belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and was an important base for the Austro-Hungarian navy. Its residents were originally mostly Italians. Because it was an important sea outlet for the Austro-Hungarian Empire, when the Savoy dynasty of northern Italy rose after 1850 and sought unification, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, while retreating in northern Italy, did not advocate returning this important sea outlet to Italy. Italian nationalists had long expressed dissatisfaction with this. It was not until the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I that Trieste and the surrounding lands were recovered, fulfilling the long-cherished wish of the Italian national movement. Unexpectedly, less than thirty years after Trieste was returned to Italy, Italy suffered a disastrous defeat in World War II due to Mussolini's mismanagement of the country. At the same time, Yugoslavia, Italy's neighbor, under Marshal Tito, embraced the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia then used the pretext of a small number of Yugoslavs residing in and around Trieste to demand that Trieste be assigned to Yugoslavia. This demand immediately received the support of the Soviet Union. In Britain and the United States, in order to safeguard the national aspirations of the Italians, there was a natural and firm opposition to the assignment of Trieste to Yugoslavia. In order to show mutual concessions, one side put forward a new proposal, advocating the internationalization of Trieste, to be managed by the United Nations for ten years, and then to be decided by a vote of local residents, which has been opposed by the Soviet Union. The new proposal put forward by the Soviet Union advocated that Italy and Yugoslavia jointly own Trieste, each appointing a governor to implement joint management, and that the Allied powers should recognize the new Italian-Yugoslav border west of Trieste. According to Molotov, this was a "tremendous concession" from the Soviet Union, but this new proposal was clearly opposed by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes. The Four Foreign Ministers Conference has convened twice, and an agreement cannot even be reached on this minor dispute over the Trieste port issue. It can be seen that the future of the Foreign Ministers Conference is fraught with hidden reefs, and the prospects for the European Peace Conference and world peace are disturbing and uneasy.</p>
<p>Although the land area disputed in the Trieste port issue is not large, it is an important key to European peace; it can even be said to be a crucial link in world peace. If an agreement can be reached on this issue, other issues will not be difficult to resolve. The core of this issue is: if Britain and the United States are determined to prevent the further expansion of Soviet power, then they naturally do not want to accept the Soviet proposal to assign Trieste and the surrounding lands to Yugoslavia or to be jointly owned by Italy and Yugoslavia; if Britain and the United States want to adopt a policy of appeasement towards the Soviet Union, then the Trieste port issue will not be difficult to resolve. Trieste is the gateway to Western Europe. If Trieste is assigned to Yugoslavia, and Yugoslavia is a vassal of the Soviet Union, then Soviet power can extend all the way into the gates of Western Europe. Due to the results of the general elections in France and Italy, the British and American authorities currently seem to feel even more obligated to prevent the further expansion of Soviet power. But at the same time, on the other hand, the Soviet Union, in view of the trend of public opinion in France and Italy, has also strengthened its trust in military force, making its attitude more resolute, and allowing its occupation forces in Europe to continue to occupy for a long time before a peace treaty is concluded. Trieste, at least for the time being, is almost a must-win issue. At the last Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, under the insistence of Byrnes, the U.S. delegation already had the cry that Paris was no different from "Munich II," and U.S. Republican stalwart Vandenberg clearly stated that everyone was unwilling to be Chamberlain in the Munich era again. From this, it can be seen how heated the dispute between the two sides has become.</p>
<p>Trieste is a small problem, but the implications behind it are of great significance. This is a problem of power politics versus democratic politics. After two world wars, should humanity still be slaves or free people? But to put it more practically, from a closer perspective, this is the focus of the struggle between the Anglo-American world and the anti-Anglo-American world. We belong neither to the anti-Anglo-American world nor to the Anglo-American world. In this struggle, we seem to be outsiders. However, the world is indivisible, and peace is also indivisible. Our allies always advise that there should be peace within China, and we deeply agree; but we also hope that for the benefit of mankind and world peace, our allies can be tolerant and make the greatest concessions to each other to seek international coordination and maintain world peace. In saying this, we deeply feel that it is necessary for the political leaders of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, like the three giants of the Rochesters Conference in the past, to speak frankly and sincerely during wartime. If we only allow a few foreign ministers to haggle over every detail at the conference table, and devote all their energy to preparing for the strategic strongholds of the Third World War, then world peace is a big problem. Although the Trieste issue is a small problem, the fall of a single leaf heralds the coming of autumn. The inability to resolve the Trieste issue is precisely a sign of the resurgence of the atmosphere of global tension!</p>
<h3>Local Dispatches: Rampant Epidemic in Suzhou, Shanghai Pharmaceutical Factories Refuse to Purchase Vaccines, Suzhou Newspaper Criticizes Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau for Control</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent] Recently, due to the rampant epidemic in this county, although the county health authorities have tried their best to prevent it, they are ultimately constrained by funds, making it difficult to develop. Even isolation hospitals are not equipped. Therefore, patients have nowhere to seek medical treatment and can only sit and wait for death. In addition to being mentally and physically exhausted, the authorities are striving for universal vaccination, but the vaccine supply has been interrupted. After ordering personnel to go to Shanghai for purchase, the various pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai all stated that the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau has implemented control, prohibiting sales to other areas, and refusing to purchase. When the news came, all sectors of the county were extremely indignant. In addition to the county government being responsible for negotiations, public opinion unanimously criticized the situation. The Suzhou Mingbao newspaper published an article titled "Protest to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau," criticizing it as an illegal measure and demanding the abolition of control.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Plans to Establish a Smoking Cessation Demonstration Center</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent] In order to strictly enforce the prohibition of smoking and drugs, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, in addition to strictly ordering all counties and cities to strictly investigate and ban them, is also planning to establish a smoking cessation demonstration center in the provincial capital. In order to establish a model to eliminate the bad practices and shortcomings of ordinary smoking cessation hospitals in the past, and to concentrate efforts to jointly plan, on the 26th, the Civil Affairs Department convened relevant units in the provincial capital to discuss issues such as housing facilities and funding sources.

<p>The Provincial Government Strictly Prohibits Military Vehicles from Engaging in Commerce</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government has reported that on the province's highways, military vehicles are still carrying passengers and goods, refusing to be inspected by various stations, soliciting business at will, and driving at any time. In particular, the vehicles are carrying more than 5,000 to 6,000 catties of passengers and goods, exceeding the prescribed load. When passing over bridges, they also do not unload, speeding and encountering accidents. Such violations of laws and regulations, destruction of traffic rules, and impact on traffic management are detrimental to the future of road administration. The provincial government has recently issued a strict ban to emphasize military discipline and benefit traffic. The Provincial Highway Bureau has ordered its affiliated offices and stations to strictly investigate and prohibit violations, and those who violate will be detained and severely punished.</p>

<h3>Byrnes Firmly Demands Quick Setting of Date for Peace Conference, Expresses Deep Dissatisfaction with Soviet Representative's Delaying Tactics, Fierce Verbal Battle Unfolds at Paris Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 29th Broadcast: Today's Four Foreign Ministers Conference will have the most important decision, that is, whether the Peace Conference will be convened this summer. The British and French Foreign Ministers and Byrnes have unanimously demanded that the Peace Conference be held this summer, but Molotov has expressed opposition.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th Dispatch] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes today engaged in a fierce verbal battle with Molotov during the three-hour plenary session of the Four Foreign Ministers regarding the convocation of the Twenty-One Nations Peace Conference, accusing each other of failing to keep their promises. This matter occurred just as the meeting was about to adjourn. Byrnes immediately announced that he would demand that the Foreign Ministers Conference decide on the date of the Peace Conference tomorrow. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov immediately replied that all issues must be discussed before the date of the Peace Conference can be agreed upon. Thereupon Byrnes said that Molotov had raised many issues that must be discussed before the Peace Conference can be convened, which is surprising, as otherwise there will never be a date to convene the Peace Conference. Molotov then proposed to discuss it the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th Dispatch] What the Four Foreign Ministers discussed this afternoon were all unresolved issues regarding the five treaties, including the Italian-Yugoslav border, Italian colonies, and other minor economic issues. Major issues were shelved because no agreement was reached, while many minor issues were resolved.</p>
<h3>Moscow Radio Calls for Opposition to U.S. Signing Separate Treaty</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th Dispatch] As the Foreign Ministers Conference is about to end, the fate of the peace treaty is still uncertain, and Moscow Radio has issued a call to oppose the United States or the Anglo-American group signing separate peace treaties with other countries. Radio commentator Nengshi broadcast in English, saying that there have been voices in the United States calling for a separate peace treaty. It should be known that after the First World War, the United States also negotiated peace separately with Germany, which ultimately made a big mistake. How can this error be repeated? According to reports from Washington in early June, there were reports of a separate peace negotiation, but Moscow's propaganda did not respond at the time. Recently, Byrnes and Bevin reiterated warnings that if the four powers cannot agree, the world cannot be left in a state of war forever, so the rumors of a separate peace treaty have arisen again. Nengshi reiterated the results of the separate peace negotiations between the United States and Germany after the First World War, such as the support of American capital for the Mussolini regime and the restoration of the economic and military power of the Weimar Republic, which ultimately led to the rise of Hitler and the outbreak of the Second World War. In other words, after the First World War, the United States not only lost its own peace, but also lost international peace. Regardless of the debate between American political parties regarding their foreign policy, it is felt that the United States currently has a trend of rejecting the group of powers to ensure lasting world peace.</p>
<h3>Italian Colonial Issues</h3>
<p>Special Committee Has No Results, Handed Back to Four Foreign Ministers for Handling</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th Dispatch] The special committee composed of the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers discussed this morning a proposal to postpone the Italian colonial issue for one year. They failed to reach an agreement on the administrative issues of the colonies during this transitional period and handed it back to the Four Foreign Ministers for handling. It is believed that the committee broke down because it did not approve of the Soviet proposal to establish a Four-Power Colonial Administrative Committee. The British representative supported continuing to maintain the current military rule, while the American and French representatives advocated finding a compromise between these two proposals. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky insisted that if this proposal was not accepted, the committee could only declare failure. The British representative opposed this step and stated that he was unwilling to recognize the collective trusteeship of the four powers, creating this precedent, as it would only give the four powers nominal sovereignty, which is the same as approving the French representative's compromise proposal of "symbolic" control by the four powers yesterday.</p>
<h3>Italian Patriotic Musician Refuses to Perform in Paris</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th Dispatch] The 79-year-old Italian famous musician Toscanini, in order to protest against the Four Foreign Ministers' decision to assign the Brigar and Tanda regions of northern Italy to France, has stated that he will never come here to conduct the performance of the Milan Orchestra.</p>
<h3>Control of Austria, Allied Countries Sign New Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th Dispatch] The four-nation representatives of the Allied Council in Vienna have signed a new control agreement that greatly limits the Allied countries' supervisory powers over the Austrian government. It is understood that the implementation of this agreement was initiated by the British side. The laws passed by the Austrian government originally needed to be reviewed by the Allied Council and could be vetoed by one country. The new agreement now stipulates that the laws passed by the Austrian parliament can only be vetoed if Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union unanimously express opposition within three weeks. However, the issues of refugees, German property within Austria, and the constitution are exceptions. The old regulations still apply, and one country can still veto them separately.</p>
<h3>Veteran Politician Nicola Elected Provisional President of Italy, Gasperi Cabinet Resigns as Usual</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 28th Dispatch] The Italian Constituent Assembly elected a provisional president, with Nicola elected with 504 votes against 396 votes. Nicola was born in 1878 and served as President of the Senate in 1923. He resigned because he was unwilling to swear allegiance to the Fascist Party and soon withdrew from politics. He was later appointed as a senator by King Emmanuel II in 1929, until after the liberation of the port of Naples by the Allied forces in 1944, when he resumed his political activities.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 29th Dispatch] Nicola has been elected as the first president of the new Republic of Italy. It is expected that the next step in the development from a monarchy to a republic will be that Prime Minister Gasperi will submit his resignation. The new cabinet will be composed of the Communist Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Socialist Party. Then the Constitutional Assembly will begin its work of drafting a new constitution.</p>
<h3>World Federation of Trade Unions Advocates Cutting Ties with Franco</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 29th Dispatch] The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions today called for cutting ties with the Franco regime and requested that the United Nations declare Franco an illegal regime, while recognizing the Giral government in exile as the legitimate government of Spain.</p>
<h3>Warships Congregate in Trieste Port</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Trieste, 28th Dispatch] In addition to the two British cruisers and several small warships originally in the port of Trieste, the U.S. ten-thousand-ton cruiser Fargo arrived here tonight.</p>
<h3>Brazil Resumes Relations with the Soviet Union, List of Foreign Envoys Announced</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Brazilian Capital, 28th Dispatch] Brazil and the Soviet Union have been severed for 28 years. The list of foreign envoys announced by the Brazilian government has not included Soviet diplomats until now. Now that the two sides have resumed diplomatic relations, the list of foreign envoys announced today only includes six Soviet personnel, including two ambassadors and counselors, and two secretaries and attendants each.</p>
<h3>Aspects of American Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>Let us turn back to the story of "Dollar Diplomacy." I cannot estimate how much profound power dollar diplomacy can generate, but on the surface, dollar diplomacy does have its considerable scale. When the 500 million British loan was being debated in Congress, British diplomats, dignitaries, and bankers were making various arrangements and activities in the United States. After the House of Commons passed it, just as it was about to be presented to the House of Lords, suddenly Professor Laski, a British authority and senior advisor to the Labour Cabinet, gave a speech, the gist of which was: Britain cannot rely solely on friendship with the United States and needlessly offend the Soviet Union. Laski warned the British people to recognize the decline of American capitalism and to look forward to the emerging power of the Soviet Union. He said that Britain should stand between the United States and the Soviet Union, leaning slightly to the side of the Soviet Union. When this speech reached the United States, many newspapers began to criticize it. The New York Daily News, which was slightly sensational and very right-wing in its attitude, wrote a very vivid editorial, publishing a photo of Laski with the caption: "Recognize the True Face of the British." The editorial said: Just as the United States was passing the loan to Britain, Labour Party General Laski gave such a "biting the hand that feeds you" speech. Let them go and get close to the Soviet Union! Anyway, the United States cannot give the thread to others and then have others slap themselves in the face. The New York Daily News called on the House of Lords to reject the loan to Britain, saying: "Now workers are on strike, and prices are so high, why not use this money to save our own people?"</p>
<p>Britain and America are After All One Family</p>
<p>Of course, the New York Daily News's criticism will not be effective, and Laski's artillery-like speech is just talk. Britain and America are, after all, one family. The Americans knew that Britain would become a strong competitor in international trade with this money, but they still lent it. I have listened to several Congressional meetings discussing loan issues. The white-haired senators spoke very childishly and like they were "joking." They put forward loan conditions, some saying, "The loan can be granted, but the British must not look down on the United States again"; others said, "The money can be lent to them, but also tell those British not to be arrogant!" Some stood up and said thirty or forty conditions one by one, but apart from the lease of military bases being something to be valued, almost all of them were childish words. But it is not easy to understand the foreign policy decisions of a childish country. As I said earlier, the Paris Conference was a turning point in American foreign policy, then after the Paris Conference, the deployment of American diplomacy should have been very active everywhere. But there is still a problem here, because the essence of diplomacy is not preparation for war, and preparation for war cannot be considered diplomacy, let alone that the American people do not want to go to war with the Soviet Union? Based on this point of view, many, many people have voiced dissatisfaction with Byrnes. This dissatisfaction is not divided into Democrats and Republicans, nor is it divided into those in power and those in opposition. If we must use party lines to distinguish them, then those who criticize Byrnes' foreign policy the most are not the Republicans, but the Democrats themselves. I cannot fail to point out Mr. Wallace as the leader of this force. Perhaps my view is a bit arbitrary, or premature, but judging from the facts pieced together, the Democratic Party is indeed splitting, and the leaders of the left wing are slowly gathering around Wallace. I have not studied the history of the development of the Democratic Party, but the Democratic Party's work in the United States and even in the world is indeed a remarkable political group, with keen vision and a large number of talents, far superior to the Republican Party. At least this is the case today. This does not mean that the Republican Party has no people. The Republican Party also has outstanding talents who have always been admired by the American people. But the Republican Party's talents are mostly pragmatic entrepreneurs who can do one thing well, but they cannot have unique vision and walk ahead of the times. For example:</p>
<p>American Bao Gong, Dewey</p>
<p>Republican General Dewey was formerly the prosecutor of New York City, prosecuting tens of thousands of cases of murder for money and harming society every year, being upright, selfless, iron-faced, and ruthless. During his tenure as prosecutor, the lives and property of the people of New York were indeed guaranteed. When the people of New York talk about Dewey, they think of Bao Gong from the Chinese "Seven Heroes and Five Righteous Ones." Now this American Bao Gong is the Governor of New York, and the security of the entire state is well-organized. Another example is former President Hoover, a Republican general. Before he became president, he handled world disaster relief, being fair, impartial, prompt, and reliable. Therefore, the Americans elected him as president. But once he became president, he was flustered in dealing with the economic downturn. After four years, he immediately stepped down. Now Hoover is doing relief work again, and the Americans are convinced that he can still do well, because he can concentrate and be responsible for doing one thing well. I don't know if this is the style of the Republican Party? This style is completely different from the characters of the Democratic Party. If we say that the Republican Party's pragmatic approach is the right way, then, according to the Chinese saying, the talents of the Democratic Party are mostly "unorthodox" and "prodigies." They have vision, have the courage, and don't necessarily have to do everything themselves. Perhaps this style was influenced and cultivated by Roosevelt in the past. Taking foreign policy as an example, when Roosevelt was alive, the Democratic Party had a heavy stone to hold it down, and because the opinions and steps within the Democratic Party during the war were consistent, not only was the internal consistency, but also the Republicans could be used by Roosevelt. After Roosevelt's death, the heavy stone was gone, and the war was over. Thus, within the Democratic Party, there were significant differences in foreign policy and foreign opinions. Mr. Wallace's main base of operations is the Molomo Hotel on 42nd Street in New York. I have listened to Mr. Wallace's speeches at evening parties several times. His basic diplomatic attitude is that the United States should not hate the Soviet Union or isolate itself from the Soviet Union. He sharply states: "If we walk hand in hand with Britain, we will definitely be dragged down by Britain." The current diplomatic responsibility of the United States is to grasp the key to world peace. The only way for the United States to seek world peace is to stand in the middle of Britain and the Soviet Union, impartially. Wallace rarely directly criticizes the current government in his speeches, but in every word, he is addressing the measures of the current government. He likes to bring out the "legacy" of the late President Roosevelt. I don't know if this is the "orthodox struggle" of the Democratic Party? In theory, Western society does not pay much attention to "orthodox" and "illegitimate." Mrs. Roosevelt often likes to listen to Mr. Wallace's speeches. Former Secretary of State Stettinius, Mrs. Roosevelt, Mr. Wallace, and Secretary of Labor Schlenber are a group of people in the Democratic Party who are more compatible with each other. Let me arbitrarily give them a name: "The Left Wing of the Democratic Party." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Cuba Plans to Ask the United States to Convene a Conference to Amend the United Nations Charter and Abolish the Veto Power Provision</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 28th] Cuban Ambassador to Washington Belt announced today that the Cuban government will request the US government to convene a conference to amend the United Nations Charter in order to abolish the veto power provision.

<h3>British Cabinet Delegation Returns Home, Indian Provisional Government Established on Thursday</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] New Delhi Radio on the 29th: The British delegation left here today to return to Britain. Before leaving, member Lawrence told reporters, "I have done my best to realize India's independence."</p>
<p>Another message: The candidates for the Indian Provisional Government have been determined, with six from the British side and two from the Indian side, who will discuss the organization of the government. The new government will take office on July 4.</p>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, New Delhi, 28th] Indian Governor-General Wavell has rejected the request of Jinnah, the chairman of the Muslim League, to postpone the Indian Constituent Assembly. His reply to Jinnah's letter stated, "We cannot go back on our words about organizing a temporary government and accept your proposal."</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Passes the Burma Bill</h3>
<p>The Legal Age of Members is Reduced</p>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 28th] The House of Commons has just passed the Burma Bill. The amendment proposed by Anderson, the Minister of Burmese Affairs, advocating that the age of members of the House of Representatives shall not be less than 21 years old, and the age of senators shall not be less than 30 years old, has also been voted through. According to the 1935 Government of Burma Act, the age of members of the House of Representatives must be over 25 years old, and the age of senators must be over 35 years old, which have now been reduced respectively. In addition, there is an explicit provision in the law prohibiting Burmese monks and nuns from participating in elections. The British House of Commons has now abolished it at the request of Labour Party member Williams.</p>
<h3>Relief of China's Famine is Only Partially Effective</h3>
<p>Hoover's Broadcast Speech Claims</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 28th] Former US President Hoover, at the request of the Canadian government, delivered a broadcast speech here tonight, stating that the gap between the world's food supply and the minimum needs of the people has been filled. If the grain-producing countries can continue to cooperate, there will be no collective starvation. However, China is an exception. Due to the inconvenience of inland transportation and the lack of organization, relief has only achieved partial effectiveness. Hoover, who represented President Truman in investigating the disaster situation in 38 countries, claimed that this speech was his "final report." It is said that the current critical period has not yet passed, and the International Emergency Food Committee should find ways to provide special assistance to 200-300 million children in Europe and tens of millions of people in Asia.</p>

<h3>Tomorrow's Atomic Bomb Test, the Huge Explosion Sound on Bikini Island Can be Received by Radio, the Speed of Radio Waves is 186,000 Miles Per Second</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 28th] According to scientists, when the atomic bomb is tested on Bikini Atoll on July 1, the speed of the sound wave when the atomic bomb explodes above the reef is 1,100 feet per second, while the speed of the radio wave is 186,000 miles per second. Therefore, it is possible that radio receivers can hear the sound of the atomic bomb exploding before the participants in the test. Commander Blandy of the atomic bomb test has announced the plan to listen to the atomic bomb explosion by radio. However, the New York National Broadcasting Company announced that the plan to listen to the atomic bomb explosion has not been fully developed, but it is expected to use short waves in the future. Blandy's plan is to place the microphones on the target ships, which is similar to the test news broadcast. One of them will be placed on the target ship "Pennsylvania," which is located in the center of the test ships. The other ships are moored hundreds of yards away. When broadcasting the news, the electrical rhythm controller on the "Pennsylvania" will start to emit "tick-tock" sounds. When the radio listener does not hear this "tick-tock" sound, it indicates that the atomic bomb has exploded, because the electrical rhythm controller on the "Pennsylvania" may have been blown to smithereens at this time. Many naval personnel believe that the amplifiers on other target ships that are farther away may not be destroyed at the same time, so radio listeners can hear the sound of the atomic bomb exploding. Blandy's flagship "McKinley" also has an amplifier, moored ten miles away, and listeners can hear the sound broadcast 40 seconds after the atomic bomb explodes. The reporter ship "Appalachian," fifteen miles away from the target ship, is also equipped with an amplifier to broadcast the sound of the atomic bomb explosion.</p>
<p>Vermilion Boats Test Radiation Energy</p>
<p>[United Press, Flagship "McKinley," 28th] There are six vermilion boats in the test fleet, which are modified from 86-foot landing craft. They will be controlled by radio by thunderbolt aircraft to test the radiation energy in the lagoon after the motorized forces dare to return to the target area. The ship is equipped with a Geiger counter, which can record the amount of radiation energy in the lagoon. There is also a wireless capsule counter attached to the wireless telephone to report the radiation energy situation to the ships. When radiation energy is found, the Geiger counter will emit a "tick-tock" sound. The more radiation energy there is, the faster the sound will be. If approaching a dangerous area, the "tick-tock" version will speed up and become a "buzz" sound. The small boats that detect radiation energy are also equipped with special equipment to extract seawater from the lagoon and bring it back to the test ships for analysis. The small boats that detect radiation energy are not driven by people. The lagoon and fixed locations are equipped with counters with rangefinders to measure the radiation energy in the water flow and air system. At the same time, aircraft are used to measure the flow of the clouds that had radiation energy in the sky after the atomic bomb exploded. It is impossible to speculate how long radiation energy can remain in the water, because there is no precedent to follow. The amount of toxic substances scattered in the air when the atomic bomb explodes in the airspace is the largest.</p>
<p>Fragments After the Explosion Fly into the Stratosphere</p>
<p>It may even cause the exploded fragments to fly into the stratosphere. According to some scientists, the residual radiation on the ground can be equal to several tons of radium ingots. A large amount of radiation energy may be concentrated in the water during underwater explosions, but whether the minerals in the seawater will increase or prolong the original danger of nuclear fission will be known after the experiment. However, at high tide, seawater containing tin will flow into the lagoon from the east, rapidly changing the water quality in the lagoon. In that case, the radiation energy of the lake water may be cleared earlier.</p>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, New York, 28th] After the bomb test, four radio-controlled flying fortresses and many naval aircraft will immediately fly to investigate and report the explosion scene with radio image transmission machines for scientists to conduct accurate research.</p>
<p>Members of the Observation Group May Visit China</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] President Truman specially appointed a survey group to participate in the original bomb test. The group includes scientists and ten members of Congress. The group leader is Dr. Compton. They will return home after the second atomic bomb test. During the first and second tests, the group may go to Guam and other US military bases in the Pacific, as well as China, Japan, and other places. However, according to the representative of the group, they will probably not go to the Philippines.</p>
<p>Atomic Bomb B29 Aircraft Took Off from Kwajalein</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Song Dehe, Kwajalein Atoll, 28th] All reporters and visitors arrived at Kwajalein Island today. More than 60 Army and Navy aircraft, including B29 aircraft, will take off from here during the test, carrying atomic bombs to Bikini. American reporters or reporters and visitors from other countries are prohibited from visiting a part of the island. When the (B29) aircraft carrying the atomic bomb takes off, various preventive measures will be taken to ensure the safety of the personnel on the island. All non-essential personnel will be evacuated from the island for fear of accidents involving the aircraft.</p>

<p>[United Press, Guajalin Island, South Pacific, 28th] The atomic bomb test commander predicted today: If the weather is bad next Monday, the first atomic bomb will be dropped in the first half of July. If there is no sunny day in half a month, the bomb will be dropped regardless of the weather.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bikini Flagship "McKinley," 29th] Secretary of the Navy Forrestal declared to new reporters on the flagship today that this original bomb test is not invaluable and can produce pre-calculated results. The ships selected for bombing are extremely interesting. The result of the Japanese battleship Nagato after being bombed is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Atomic Bomb Test Day, Special Commemorative Postmark</h3>

<h3>Inspection of the Bombing of Hiroshima, the Report of American Experts is Released, Proving that the Power of the Atomic Bomb is Indeed Terrible, a Far-Reaching Plan Should be Prepared to Prevent Attacks</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Experts sent by President Truman to Japan to inspect the atomic bombing situation have submitted a report today, drafted by Averell of New Jersey Insurance Company, which advocates that the United States should formulate a far-reaching plan to prevent atomic bomb attacks. It is said that the bombing situation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki proves that the danger of the atomic bomb is not fictional. The United States should "now" prepare how to deal with the atomic bomb, and should not slacken in the slightest. All American troops should be dispersed, hidden, and protected. In addition, they should be careful at all times so as not to lose the ability to counterattack after being bombed by one or several atomic bombs. In order to protect the people, fortifications that can resist atomic bomb explosions, flashes, burns, and radiation should be built. Other necessary plans include building stronger houses, organizing a national reserve defense force equipped with grain seeds, emergency supplies, and equipment, dispersing various industrial and medical equipment, and evacuating cities. At the same time, the Army Department's Manhattan Atomic Bomb Manufacturing Engineering Office also submitted a similar report. Both reports do not believe that some people died from the radiation energy left in the bombed area during the atomic bomb explosion. However, according to experts who went to Japan for inspection, if the atomic bomb exploded not hundreds of feet above the ground, but on the ground plane, the scene would be even more tragic. The Army Department declared that the initial report that the first atomic bomb contained approximately 20,000 tons of TNT explosives was believed to be reliable. However, presidential inspection experts estimated that 2,100 tons of high explosives, incendiary bombs, and fragmentation bombs could have the same effect if dropped on Hiroshima. Both reports gave vivid descriptions of the atomic bomb's destructive and terrifying bombing and burning, and described the principle of the explosion and its destructive nature, but did not reveal any atomic secrets. According to the Army Department, the explosion of the first atomic bomb was determined around the fall of 1942. At that time, the selection of targets was based on the following conditions: the distance of aircraft navigation, whether the environment was easy to identify the bombing target, and the weather conditions. The distance of the second bombing target (Nagasaki was the second target), what impact it would have on the Japanese people and shortening the war, and what impact it would have on the enemy's morale. The expert inspection report warned the American people based on the destruction of the atomic bomb that the danger of the atomic bomb is indeed real, and they became more convinced after going to Japan for inspection.</p>

<h3>Rare Books: Jiajing and Wanli Editions of the Shanghai County Gazetteer Deposited in the Municipal Gazetteer Office; Discovery of the Hongzhi County Gazetteer Ten Years Ago; A Unique and Unprecedented Event</h3>
<p>The rare Jiajing and Wanli editions of the Shanghai County Gazetteer from the Ming Dynasty have now been deposited in the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Office. This event, combined with the office's discovery of the Hongzhi Shanghai County Gazetteer ten years ago, constitutes a unique and unprecedented event in the history of Shanghai gazetteers. According to the person in charge of the office, the Shanghai County Gazetteer was revised three times in the Ming Dynasty, and only the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Office has collected and deposited all three editions over the past 300 years. The Hongzhi Gazetteer had not been seen since the Ming Dynasty, and the only copy was hidden in the Tianyige Library, obscure and unknown. It was not until 1936 that the office learned of its existence and negotiated for a photographic copy. The Jiajing Gazetteer could not be found even when the Shanghai Gazetteer was revised during the Kangxi period, and the only copy belonged to the Jigu Ge Library. The woodblocks of the Wanli Gazetteer were damaged during the Kangxi period, and the only copies in the world are those at the Xujiahui Catholic Church, Wu Xing Jiang Mengping, and half a copy at the Beijing Library. Since its re-establishment, the Municipal Gazetteer Office has diligently sought documents, widely inquired, and collected information, continuing its pre-war work, and finally acquired the Jiajing and Wanli Gazetters, completing the collection of all three Ming Dynasty Shanghai gazetteers, including the Hongzhi edition. Its historical significance is real. "The Shanghai Yearbook, 5th Edition, North", and the Shanghai Directory have either already been edited, or are in printing. In terms of archival materials, it has recovered and reorganized tens of thousands of volumes of books and records secretly stored after August 13th, and continues to visit and purchase classical books related to Shanghai literature. The office is the most academically research-oriented institution among the administrative agencies, and its passion for work can be seen from its remarkable achievements. Furthermore, it is understood that a photographic reprint of the Hongzhi Gazetteer has already been made by the office, and it plans to follow suit with the Jiajing and Wanli Gazetters. It is estimated that the cost for each edition will be around 40,000 yuan, and a subscription has been launched. If 100 copies are subscribed, work will begin.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Industry and Mining Construction Association Discusses Current Economic Problems on the Eve of the Economic Conference</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] As the central government is about to convene a national economic planning conference, the Shanghai Industry and Mining Construction Association held a tea party yesterday on the eighth floor of the Jinmen Hotel to discuss various current economic problems. More than 20 people from industry and commerce, as well as experts such as Cai Shuhou, Yang Kaidao, Chen Baoyi, Shui Xiangyun, and Wu Juenong, attended. The discussion was lively, and the causes of the current economic crisis in our country were discussed in detail. The meeting adjourned after 6:00 PM. The general opinions can be summarized into the following points: (1) The current exchange rate should not be changed for the time being, but differential exchange rates or separate subsidies should be adopted for import and export industries based on their nature. (2) Regarding the issue of state-owned and private enterprises, in principle, state capital should be developed, but in reality, state-owned enterprises are currently controlled by bureaucratic comprador capital. Therefore, a democratic approach should be adopted, so as not to harm private enterprises. (3) Regarding the issue of prices, the fundamental solution is to balance government revenue and expenditure. If a balance cannot be achieved, the extent of the imbalance should be disclosed. Secondly, transportation must be smooth and materials must be controlled. Japan must be required to compensate in kind, such as machinery and equipment. (4) The main reason for the bankruptcy of national industries is not high wages. Under the current circumstances, labor and capital should cooperate. Since the exchange rate is inconvenient to change, at least customs autonomy must be sought. In addition, the loan interest rate of the Central Bank seems too high. (5) The fundamental solution to all economic crises lies in political domestic peace and international stability.</p>
<h3>U.S. Troops Prone to Venereal Diseases; Police Busy Inspecting Prostitutes</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Government recently received a message from the U.S. military authorities stating that some U.S. troops in Shanghai have contracted venereal diseases due to frequenting prostitutes, and have brought them back to the United States, causing a significant impact. They specifically requested close cooperation from the city authorities to reduce this problem. The Municipal Government immediately instructed the Municipal Police Bureau to strengthen enforcement. Although the Police Bureau has already been actively handling this matter, some private prostitutes are operating secretly. A method is now being devised to severely crack down on them, and all brothels have been ordered to register and prohibit the operation of prostitutes with diseases. It is reported that in addition to setting up clinics for prostitutes to be examined and treated, the Health Bureau will also set up mobile medical teams to visit and treat prostitutes in various brothels.</p>
<h3>Preparing Three Months of Food to Overcome the Lean Season; City Government Allocated 8,000 Dan Yesterday to Supply the Market; Minister Xu Arrived in Shanghai Upon Summons to Discuss Sources of Rice</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to report on the methods of handling recent rice price fluctuations and the news that rice prices will stabilize within one or two days, Mayor Wu specifically convened a meeting with reporters in the City Government conference room at 4:00 PM yesterday. Mr. Wu first reported that the City Government is planning to prepare three months of food for July, August and September to overcome the lean season. Yesterday, the City Government has allocated 8,000 dan of stored rice to supply the market, and warned rice merchants not to arbitrarily raise rice prices in the future. He stated that there is no shortage of rice, as the average daily transaction of rice shops in the city is only five thousand several hundred dan, which is sufficient to stabilize the market. Now, the City Government has decided to use a sufficient amount of stored rice to meet the emergency, so there is no reason for rice prices to rise. The method of selling this rice will follow the original regulations, that is, the selling price will be 46,000 yuan per stone, plus 6% profit and transportation costs, so the selling price should be 51,000 or 52,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding the invitation of President Song to invite Minister Xu Kan to Shanghai, the mayor specifically stated that it was solely to discuss the source of rice, and had nothing to do with the handling of the grain loan case. The grain loan case has now been handed over to the Shanghai-Wusong Preparatory Command for handling.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu expressed his pain regarding some rice merchants who disregard the country and the people, only seeking personal gain, and decided to adopt appropriate methods to actively respond to the schemes of unscrupulous merchants, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods. After the arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai, it will also be reasonably distributed. The disparity between large rice shops selling more than one hundred dan per day, while small rice shops selling only one or two dan, is considered to be in need of adjustment.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Minister of Food Xu Kan, upon the summons of President Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan, flew from Nanjing to Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and went directly to President Song's private residence on Qiqi Road to hold consultations.</p>
<h3>The Changjiang and Santai Companies Distribute Rice From Storage</h3>
<p>The rice stored by the Changjiang and Santai grain loan companies, which was previously sealed by the Municipal Government, was unsealed yesterday by the Social Affairs Bureau in conjunction with the Garrison Command, and distributed to 779 rice shops throughout the city for sale at fair prices. All rice shops must clearly mark the selling price of high-quality white rice, and must not mix it with inferior goods. All sales of five dou or more must have invoices. If the above regulations are violated, citizens may report at any time, and they will be strictly investigated according to law.</p>
<h3>Sichuan and Jiangxi Rice Arrive in Shanghai; To be Distributed by the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>According to sources from the Ministry of Food in Shanghai, 100,000 shi of Sichuan rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, amounting to 640 tons, or approximately 8,500 Shanghai dan. It was transported by the Yongkang ship and two barges, passing through Yichang, Hankou, and Nanjing before arriving here. The ship is currently docked at the Huangpu Wharf and is expected to be completely unloaded within days. In addition, the first batch of 1,700 tons of Jiangxi rice, loaded on the China Merchants Bureau's Cai E ship, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The Food Department has notified the transportation authorities here to hand over all of the Jiangxi rice to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for overall distribution. According to Ye Xinming, the newly appointed director of the Shanghai General Warehouse of the department, after the abolition of the Grain Administration Commissioner's Office, the business related to market management and supply for the people's food will be taken over by the Grain Department of the Social Affairs Bureau from July 1st. The business related to receiving and distributing military grain will be handled by the newly established General Warehouse. The General Warehouse will also be established on July 1st, and is planned to be divided into four groups: warehousing, storage, allocation, and transportation, each with its own responsibilities. The military grain requisition is divided according to the supply area, and Shanghai and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces all belong to the first supply area. The Military Grain Requisition Regulations will still be followed. From September 1st, when the land tax collection in the recovered area begins, the military grain will be changed to requisitioning and borrowing according to the one-requisition-one-borrowing method. As for the distribution of military grain, it will be decided by the Military Grain Accounting Conference, which is composed of the Logistics Department of the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Finance and Food. In addition, there are currently eight warehouses in Shanghai, which will be increased as needed in the future.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Remittances from Siam</h3>
<p>Zheng Ziliang Holds Meeting with News Media to Report</p>
<p>Zheng Ziliang, honorary director of the Siamese General Chamber of Commerce, hosted a meeting with the news media at the Central Western Restaurant yesterday to report that recently, due to the worsening disaster situation in their hometowns, overseas Chinese in Siam all wanted to send money home. However, due to the difficulty in overseas remittances, they switched to remitting gold and tried to send it illegally by plane. It was suddenly investigated by the government, and 2,000 taels of gold bars were confiscated. Mr. Zheng specifically appealed to the news media for three points: (1) Please make a righteous voice in the news media to attract the government's attention, and please ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to negotiate with the Siamese authorities based on reason in order to facilitate overseas remittances.

(3) Hope that the Guangzhou and Chaozhou hometown associations can request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to ensure the safety of overseas Chinese in Siam.</p>

<h3>The American Military Shows Indifference to Communist Anti-American Propaganda</h3>
<p>Implementing Established Policies to Assist the National Government; No Changes Due to Any Obstacles</p>
<p>The American military here is very indifferent to the Chinese Communist Party's request for the U.S. military to withdraw from China and Mao Zedong's accusation that the U.S. military is fueling the Chinese civil war, and believes that this kind of propaganda has no effect on U.S. policy in China. They said that the Kuomintang represents the Chinese government today, and if we want to assist the development of all parties in China, we should target its government. The American military is not paying much attention to the CCP's malicious propaganda, but they claim that the United States' policy toward China and its assistance to its recovery plan have long been decided, and that all policies will not change due to any obstacles.</p>

<h3>Laborers' and Employees' Cost of Living Index Slightly Fluctuates This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Government Research Office has completed the compilation of this month's cost of living index for the city, which was officially announced yesterday. The general cost of living index for laborers in this city is 404.06539, which is 1.34% lower than last month. The general cost of living index for employees is 319.51766, which is 4.88% higher than last month. The reason for the slight decrease in the cost of living index for laborers this month is entirely due to the drop in grain prices this month. According to the food index of last month, it was 452.31366, and the food index for this month is 438.45419, a decrease of approximately 3.06%. Other items such as housing, clothing, and sundries have all slightly increased. The reporter has specifically compared the cost of living index for laborers for last month and this month and listed them in the table below:</p>
<h3>Wen Zongyao's Unauthorized Sale of Public Property Continues to be Heard by the Local Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Guangzhao Association of this city filed a lawsuit requesting confirmation that the land sale was invalid, accusing Wen Zongyao, who unauthorizedly sold public property, and the Qian Tai Commercial Bank, etc., who purchased the property. The local court continued the hearing yesterday. The defendants argued that the board of directors had made several resolutions at the time, and Wen Zongyao acted in the capacity of a legal representative, which was unrelated to his political behavior as the acting president of the Pseudo-Judicial Yuan. Therefore, they requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The plaintiff intends to submit additional evidence at the next hearing. The court allowed the submission and adjourned the hearing. Although the litigation fee in this case has reached 1.3 million yuan, it is not yet considered the largest amount among the cases accepted by the local court, because the property lawsuit of the New Asia Hotel has a litigation fee of more than 20 million yuan, which is even more than this case.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Astronomers once made the prophecy of "no summer this year." However, the recent unusually hot weather proves the inaccuracy of this prophecy. In order to find out how hot the summer will be this year, the reporter visited Zheng Zizheng, director of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory on the Bund, yesterday. According to Zheng, the summer temperature in 1934 was the highest in the past 69 years, with 101.7 degrees Fahrenheit in June, 104.3 degrees in July, and 104 degrees in August. In these 69 years, the average highest temperature in summer was 95 degrees, and the highest temperature this year was 99 degrees on June 27. Zheng believes that this temperature is generally normal. There may still be hot days in July and August this year, but the changes will not be significant, and it will definitely not be as unusually hot as in 1934. Zheng also said that the previous report that this year's climate is abnormal due to the impact of the atomic bomb is not tenable from a scientific point of view.</p>

We encountered many dangers, but we overcame all difficulties with a patriotic and loyal spirit, achieved the final victory, and completed my mission during my term of office. This is something I will never forget. However, although the Anti-Japanese War has been won, economic construction is just beginning. The work of the Chamber of Commerce will be even more important than before. I hope that all colleagues will uphold the spirit of service of the past and take 'hard work' as their motto. Since the May Fourth Movement, I have represented the Chamber of Commerce and served the business community, from the Zhabei Chamber of Commerce to the General Chamber of Commerce to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, for nearly 30 years. I have not shied away from difficulties, nor have I accepted bribes. I can ask myself without shame. In the future, Xiaolai will serve the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and also serve as a supervisor of this association. I hope that my colleagues will assist from the sidelines."

<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Hankou Shipping Lines Shorten Travel Time</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Business Office of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been restored for more than a year.

<h3>The Work of Building the Police is Urgent; Mr. Li Shizhen Expresses His Views</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Mr. Li Shizhen, President of the Central Police School, recently expressed his views on some important issues related to the police at present. The main points are summarized as follows: Li first revealed Chairman Jiang's instruction: "The foundation of nation-building lies in the police," so he believes that the work of building the police is indeed urgent. However, the development of police work must be based on the foundation of caring for the people and serving the society, and it is necessary to grasp the historical center of gravity, implement benevolent governance, adapt to the trends of the times, and implement the rule of law. Li believes that there are three reasons for the poor handling of police in our country: (1) insufficient quality, (2) too low salaries, and (3) simple equipment. Therefore, if we want to improve the police in our country, we must strive to improve these three aspects in order to talk about establishing the police of a modern country. Since the enemy surrendered, social order has not yet been restored. Li believes that the key to this problem is the poor police duty methods. There is no fixed scope of service, and responsibility cannot be confirmed. The police jurisdiction system recently implemented in Beijing and Shanghai is designed to address this deficiency. However, the outside world believes that the system is strengthening the management of the people, which is a misunderstanding. Li then analyzed the issue of democracy and the police in detail. He believes that talking about democracy is inseparable from the law, and the enforcer of the law is the police. Therefore, the police are the tool for implementing democracy. Li finally hopes that the police themselves can cultivate morality and change past concepts. At the same time, he also deeply hopes that the public's perception of the police should also change, and that they should value and trust the police. He deeply hopes that all relevant parties should assist the work of building the police from various aspects in order to catch up and keep pace with the police of the world's powers.</p>

<h3>Tsinghua Holds a Meeting, Rice Prices Stabilize Once</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech at the Tsinghua Alumni Association Yesterday</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] The Shanghai Tsinghua Alumni Association held an opening ceremony yesterday because the new clubhouse of the China Flower Bank was ready. Mayor Wu and his wife, Zhou Yizhuan, Gu Yuxiu, Li Zufan, and Wang Huacheng, who recently came to Shanghai and are about to travel to the Philippines to participate in the Independence Day celebrations, were among the more than 200 people present. After Mayor Wu's wife performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Mayor Wu gave a speech, stating briefly: The last time a meeting was held, it coincided with his arrival in Shanghai to take office, and the most important issue at that time was food. Fortunately, it was soon calmed down. This time, the meeting is again at a time when the food problem is serious, which can be called a coincidence. Before the new grain enters the market, the rice market often undergoes many changes, like a malaria phenomenon. This is because unscrupulous merchants always seek to take advantage of any loopholes in the authorities' actions. However, a large amount of rice will arrive in Shanghai within a day or two, so it is believed that after this meeting, the current difficulties will definitely have a solution. Therefore, every time the association holds a meeting, it seems that the rice price can be stabilized once. It is hoped that the Tsinghua Alumni Association will hold more meetings in the future so that he can always lower the rice price. He can also often shed some "worries" (Mayor's original word was English Worry) in the alumni association. The mayor praised Tsinghua alumni for strictly adhering to their positions and working diligently, which is in line with the school motto of "self-improvement without ceasing." He also said that the main reason why China cannot be as good as people want and the intellectual community has failed to lead well is that they often become corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry as soon as they leave school, which affects the country. He deeply hopes that the alumni of the alma mater can carry forward the Tsinghua spirit and work hard for the country. Then, the chairman of the association, Li Zufan, introduced the newly appointed secretary-general of the association, Zhou Yongde, to the audience. At about six o'clock, everyone dispersed happily.

<h3>A Glimpse of the Improvement of Municipal Middle Schools: Restoration and Addition Total 15 Schools; Shanghai West Plans to Establish a Municipal Art Normal School</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Before the Anti-Japanese War, there were six municipal middle schools in this city: Jingye, Shibei, Wusong, Yangjing, Xinlu Normal School, and Wuben Girls' School. After the Anti-Japanese War, the above six schools were fully restored, and five schools formerly established by the Public Works Department were taken over: Yucai, Gezhi, Jiqi, Jinyuan (formerly Huatong Public School), and First Girls' School. Four schools were added: Gaoqiao, Luxing, Fuxing, and Kindergarten Normal School, for a total of fifteen schools. In addition, three schools were established: Remi Road West Overseas School, Dihua Road West Overseas Boys' School, and Yuyuan Road West Overseas Girls' School, specializing in enrolling American, British, French, Russian, and other foreign students. After the Japanese surrendered last autumn, foreign students who had been living in concentration camps in Shanghai for a long time had no books to read, so these special schools were established. Since July and August, the number of foreign students has gradually decreased, and most of the nationals of various countries have established their own schools. Therefore, the West Overseas Schools are no longer needed, so the education authorities have decided to close the three schools starting from the next semester. The Remi Road West Overseas School site will be moved into by the Municipal Wuben Girls' School. Moreover, because there are still few municipal middle schools in Shanghai West, a municipal Shixi Middle School will be added, and it is also planned to establish a municipal art normal school. The school buildings will use the original sites of the Yuyuan Road West Overseas Girls' School and the Dihua Road West Overseas Boys' School. This is a glimpse of the recent improvements in municipal middle schools in this city. (Tian)</p>

<h3>160,000 Tons of Foreign Rice Arriving, No Problem with Shanghai Residents' Food Supply Before New Rice Enters the Market</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] It is learned that since President Song decided to find a way to supply 8,000 dan of rice to the city every day, the future of the city's food supply has become clearer. A rice industry insider told reporters yesterday that 20,000 dan of rice have already arrived in the city. Before the new rice enters the market, there is absolutely no problem with the continuous supply of rice to Shanghai. Moreover, on July 15th, the first batch of 160,000 tons of Brazilian foreign rice will be shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, the current grain price in the Shanghai rice market is expected to remain unchanged. In addition, since the authorities unsealed the rice stored in the San Tai and Yangtze rice stores, it has been distributed to various rice shops in the market for sale yesterday. The stored rice is all high-quality thick japonica rice. Therefore, it is expected that from the next day or two, rice will be widely available for sale in various rice shops in the city.</p>
<p>North and South Rice Markets Scheduled to Open on the 3rd</p>
<p>After the North and South Rice Markets in Shanghai were ordered to actively prepare, it has now been decided to start business on July 3rd. It is reported that more than one hundred businesses are participating in trading in each market. It is learned that before the war, rice trading in Shanghai was conducted individually by rice shops. After the victory, trading was concentrated in the Qingli market. However, after centralized trading, it was very easy to have speculation, manipulation, and price increases. This time, the authorities are determined to disintegrate the centralized market. During the transitional period, the old North and South Rice Markets will be restored first, in order to gradually restore the pre-war system of individual transactions by each firm. This measure can break up the atmosphere of speculative trading and prevent normal trading from being hindered. Yesterday was the last day of business for the Qinglian Pavilion temporary rice market. Market transactions were sluggish and have already changed from a buying and selling market to a distribution market.</p>
<p>Decrease in Passenger and Cargo Registration, Increase in Self-Transportation by Rice Shops</p>
<p>The registration of passengers and goods in the rice market decreased again yesterday. The total was only 959 shi, including 795 shi of white japonica rice, 10 shi of Yangxian rice, 2 shi of white yuan rice, and 152 shi of milled xian rice. However, self-transportation and self-sales by rice shops increased sharply, totaling 1,464 shi and 54 packages. Transactions between traders in the market remained the same as before, with few changes. The goods in each stall remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Flour continued to show strength. Raw oil was scarce and quick-selling, with an increase of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. There were still shipments of soybean oil, with an increase of around 1,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil was stable. Yellow soybeans were selling well but were somewhat sluggish. Raw peanuts were average, and so was mung bean, with high prices rising and low prices falling. Cowpeas were in demand and sold quickly, remaining in the station. Broad beans were stable at high prices, with the middle and lower grades sluggish and inactive. Soybean cakes from Shantou were still acceptable and rose by 300 to 400 yuan. Wheat from other ports was selectively purchased by those who were clever at digestion and disposal, and the market was firm. The factory continued to digest it, and the prices were neither good nor bad. The Miscellaneous Grain Association will be closed for three days starting tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Relief Rice, Siamese Overseas Chinese Donate 200,000 Bags, The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Arriving in Four Batches</h3>
<p>Ma Canrong, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Food in Vietnam, recently returned to China from Haiphong. According to Ma, Vietnam and Siam both reported bumper harvests this year, and local grain prices are low. Siamese overseas Chinese organized the Siamese Overseas Chinese Relief Committee for the Motherland's Famine to raise donations to purchase rice to relieve the food shortage in the motherland. A total of 200,000 large bags of rice were purchased. 70,000 bags have already been shipped to China, and the remaining 130,000 bags will be shipped in a short period of time. Ma will also report the situation of various works to Minister Xu of the Ministry of Food within the coming days.</p>
<p>The relief supplies allocated to us by the UNRRA are far from the quantity we requested, especially in the case of rice. Since China began receiving relief supplies in December of last year, as of now, a total of three batches of rice have been shipped. The first batch arrived on March 25th, with a total of 12,445 bags. The second batch arrived on May 25th, with a total of 32,000 bags. The above two batches totaled 3,000 tons. The third batch arrived in Shanghai on the 25th of this month, with a total of 1,600 bags, only over 100 tons. It is reported that the fourth batch has already departed from Hong Kong and will arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month. It is also reported that the quantity is only several thousand bags.</p>
<h3>American Agricultural Experts Arrive in Shanghai, Export Industry Hopes for Immediate Relief</h3>
<p>The Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group, a group of eight American members, led by the head of the group, Mr. Hachison, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Chinese delegation members Shen Zonghan, Lin **, Shou Jingwei, Ge Jingzhong, and others have prepared various materials and will immediately begin joint research and investigation. The American delegation's visit to China will pay special attention to improving the four major agricultural products of our export trade, such as tung oil, tea, silk, and wool, and increasing exports to enrich our foreign exchange resources. Chinese officials and people are very excited. According to export industry magnates Qiu Liangrong, Zhang Yujiu, and others, the investigation by the group will take about two months. Then, a plan will be drawn up for the government's reference to provide a fundamental solution. This cannot be achieved in one or two years, and it is difficult to immediately solve the current difficulties in the export industry. Mr. Qiu Liangrong also stated that the current emergency measures for the export trade are: (1) Exemption from export tax. (2) Establishing a subsidy system, with the government bearing the cost of foreign shipping and insurance for all export goods. (3) Reducing transportation costs, which should follow the methods of foreign shipping companies, with equal reductions for both water and land transportation. (4) Low-interest loans, which the Central Bank has already implemented, are only for packing loans. It is hoped that the time limit will be changed to start from the time of transportation. (5) Exemption from business tax. The above five items are not trade policies, but only emergency measures for the present. It is hoped that the government will adopt them. As for a thorough solution in the future, the only hope is that there will be no war, transportation will be restored, prices will be lowered, and wages will be reduced, so that the cost of export goods can be reduced accordingly. Only then can a balance in international trade be sought.</p>
<h3>Reviewing the Long-Term Talk on Foreign Exchange, May Have a Stimulating Effect in the Short Term, Authorities Warn Against Falling into the Trap of Speculators</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Because the half-year settlement period for the silver and money industry is approaching, the new trends in the financial market after the settlement period have become the focus of speculation in all circles. Among them, the talk of long-term foreign exchange is particularly rampant. The reporter once consulted several financial authorities on this issue. Their opinions were that raising the exchange rate might be able to slightly stimulate the export industry for a while. However, the gain will soon be completely wiped out by the soaring prices that follow the long-term appreciation of the exchange rate. The impact will make the current stage of prices and exchange rates more confusing. Therefore, raising the exchange rate is by no means a good policy at present. The reporter then inquired about this matter from the relevant authorities of the Central Bank. They stated that rumors about raising the exchange rate have been repeatedly heard. The market is easily affected by rumors and does not know that it is falling into the trap of speculators. Only after suffering losses will they recognize the truth of the rumors. Therefore, from the perspective of the authorities, they have no need to repeatedly defend these rumors. They only know to use facts to show everything based on the established policies.</p>
<h3>American Dollar Users Shift Positions, British Pound and Hong Kong Notes Become Active One After Another, Gold Prices Fall Slightly, American Dollars Remain Silent</h3>
<p>Shanghai yesterday saw a slight fluctuation. However, because of the holiday, some people tried to balance their positions. Although there were some who were killed off, those with capital considered that the environment was not optimistic and bought gold to protect themselves. The overall situation was extremely stable. The morning opened at the same level. On the way, it once fell back from the 2 million mark to 1.97 million. The central bank distributed 325 bars, and the price was also reduced to 1.975 million. However, it was still slightly boosted to above 1.99 million near noon. In the early afternoon, it was still flat. Later, because the transaction was even rarer, those who were pressed for funds were eager to settle, and it fell below 1.97 million. Then it was slightly flattened. As a result, it fell slightly by 3,000 compared with the previous day. The unofficial discount closed at six points. The cash market was tight, and the interest rate ranged from one and a half to two cents.</p>
<p>Because those who needed American dollars moved to the British pound group, and at the same time, the exchange industry people tended to arbitrage between British and American exchange rates, they became even more deserted. The British pound added to the beauty and rose to 9,400 yesterday. The Indian exchange rate was even higher to 720 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was sold at 590 yuan. Transactions were difficult to announce because of the limited supply. Based on the current price of the British pound and the American dollar, the exchange rate between the British and American exchange rates is only over 3.4 yuan, which is still a distance from the official price of 4 yuan. The trend will definitely rise again. The American dollar is still deserted. Yesterday, it rose and fell slightly with the price of gold. The highest price in the middle was 2,670 yuan, and the lowest price was 2,620 yuan. At noon, it was around 2,660 yuan. It fell slightly in the afternoon. As a result, compared with the previous closing, there was no change. The Hong Kong notes had limited chips, and the supply could not meet the demand. As a result, it rose by another 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bulls Compete to Sell, Black Market for Government Bonds Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bulls made the final killings on government bonds. The Ministry of Finance will implement the return of principal next month, which is inevitable panic. The selling wind was raging. The hot Grade C transactions were slightly active due to the urgent sale by the holders. The price fell from above 700 yuan to below 450 yuan, and then flattened slightly. As a result, it fell sharply by 40% compared with the previous closing. Miscellaneous brands also fell slightly by 35%. The price difference narrowed again, with the difference between hot and cold being only 100 yuan. Foreign stocks were all suspended. Over-the-counter transactions were slightly quoted for Yongsha Mayer, and the quoted price was slightly lower. The rest were all no market.</p>
<h3>Daya Bank Closed Down, Using Deposits for Speculation</h3>
<p>Dazheng Bank, located at No. 19 Tianjin Yi, because senior soldiers failed in operating weaving, lost 50,000 yuan. Yesterday, another six ** of the period were urged, but unable to ** , declared bankruptcy and stopped business. The Shanghai Data Exchange issued a notice yesterday afternoon on the handling method for the bank's bills of exchange. The original text said: "After investigating the Daya Bank, the exchange bank acting on behalf of our office No. 50.38, after the exchange on the 28th, the amount remaining in our office was not enough to pay the difference. Although it was delayed until midnight, the bank still failed to provide the difference to the office. Then, with the approval of the Exchange Committee of our office, (1) each bank and bank in exchange relationship with the Daya Bank on the 28th should return to each other the back exchange **. Those who have already paid the seal should cancel the payment seal. (2) From the 29th, our office will stop acting on behalf of all receipts and payment bills of the Daya Bank."</p>
<h3>China Purchases 50,000 Tons of Wheat from Argentina</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 29th]</p>
<p>China has been negotiating the purchase of wheat from Argentina since the beginning of last month, and it has now been decided to purchase 50,000 tons, at a price of 30 pesos (Argentine currency) per 100 kilograms.</p>
<h3>Customs Duties on Imported Goods Based on Market Wholesale Prices</h3>
<p>If There is No Wholesale Market Price, the Customs Will Determine the Price</p>
<p>Since the victory, the import of goods into Shanghai has become more and more frequent. As for the payment of import duties, the market wholesale price is used as the basis for calculation. The customs duty wholesale price clause is as follows: (1) All goods will be deemed to be the average market price at which the goods are freely sold or can be sold in the open market at the port of import at the time of import in ordinary wholesale quantities under ordinary trade conditions as the wholesale market price. (2) If there is no wholesale market price for goods at the port of import, the wholesale market price in other major domestic markets may be used as the basis for calculating the dutiable value. (3) If there is no wholesale market price for goods in the domestic market, the bona fide price ex-ship plus 5% should be used as the dutiable value under normal circumstances. (4) If the goods do not have a wholesale market price or a bona fide price ex-ship to be based on due to the following circumstances, the dutiable value may be determined by the customs at its discretion. (A) The ownership of the goods is of a leasing nature and still belongs to others. (B) The goods are subject to royalties and the royalties are not certain or are insufficient for other reasons to estimate the value of the goods. (C) The goods are sold to agents or branches. (D) The goods are transported to China under other special circumstances.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollars Imported From Tianjin</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] A large batch of silver dollars was imported yesterday. The China Merchants Bureau's Huangyu ship returned to Shanghai from Tianjin, transporting 8,554 boxes of silver dollars, which were declared by the Central Bank. The ship is currently berthed at floating pontoon No. 10 and 11 for unloading.</p>
<h3>Uranium Standard Said, American Doctor's Suggestion</h3>
<p>(Chicago, 28th) Dr. Daniels of the University of Chicago recently wrote an article in a magazine, advocating the use of uranium instead of gold as the basis of the American currency system. Dr. Daniels pointed out that because uranium contains a certain amount of energy, it can be free from the impact of price fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Coarse Yarn Sales Remain Strong, Spot Cotton Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was unusually firm. 20s spot goods were still unsalable. Dasheng Yarn Factory opened over one hundred pieces of Nianzhi Cai Kuixing, and small-scale goods and road yarn were also transacted in not a few cases, all of which were absorbed by the Jingwu gangs. Fine yarn was still not improving, and both supply and demand were silent. At the close of the 20s Shuangma, someone who was tired of Luoke said that it was reduced to seek cash urgently.</p>
<p>Yesterday's New York American Cotton Telegraph, the market fluctuated, up and down three or five pounds. The near-term was US$31.19, and the long-term was US$31.24. The spot price of Metering was US$31.65. The spot cotton trading in the local market was still good. Lixin Factory imported Metering, and Xiamen Factory imported Pengjia Pi. In addition, the trade of flower numbers was not deserted, and the market was still in a firm situation.</p>
<p>Both the cloth street and the customers have a male star need. Because the supply of serge is short and the Imitation Construction Company has not supplied it for several periods, the market price is uniquely high. The customers on the Shilin cloth distant road have already begun to distinguish, and the market price is as stable as usual. However, bleached cloth and fancy cloth have entered the season when the orders fall, and the momentum is weaker.</p>
<h3>New Fried Green Tea Prices Drop</h3>
<p>Taiwan Bud Tea Increases Again, British Government Tenders for Tea</p>
<p>In recent days, a lot of new fried green tea from Yushan, Jiangxi and Wenzhou, Zhejiang has been transported to Shanghai, but the shops on this street, in view of the fact that during the excessive period at the end of June, the stomach for food was very weak, and the supply exceeded the demand. The prices turned sharply downward. Other colors, both selling and buying, the market was firm. However, black tea and bud tea in Taiwan, Yixing and Wuxi continued to be bought, and the handlers raised the price again. As a result, the market price rose by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per dan compared with the previous day. As for the foreign tea market, Wan Yutai, Hua Tea, Wuchang, Xinhua and other firms in Shanghai shipped red and green tea for export the other day, the number of which was about several thousand boxes. According to the tea merchants, the foreign prices are extremely tight, but in order to expand sales, there is really no profit to be made.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the British government recently tendered to purchase a large amount of tea from China and India. It is reported that Chinese import and export firms and tea merchants are enthusiastically mailing tea samples and prices for bidding.</p>
<h3>Export Price of Fur Falls, The Reason Why Bristles Do Not Meet Standards</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] After the victory of this war, sea transportation was initially opened, and Chinese exporters did their best to load and transport the export goods that had been accumulated for many years to foreign countries. European and American countries also needed the goods that had not been seen from China for many years, so they absorbed them in groups. The price of the goods was quite high, and exporters made a lot of profits. Later, because similar goods arrived one after another, it was suddenly felt that the supply exceeded the demand, and the price of the goods fell sharply. For example, the price of fur in the American market has fallen by six-tenths, while in mainland China, the price of goods has continued to rise due to the purchase by exporters and the devaluation of the currency, which has formed a strange phenomenon that the price of export goods in the place of origin is higher than the overseas market price. In addition, such as the pig bristles, during the war, the enemy and puppet used them as military supplies, regardless of standards, and purchased them all. This time, they were transported to the United States and were mostly returned because the size did not meet the standards. The loss of exporters is not in the middle. At the same time, because the initial export goods were mostly hoarded by people outside the industry, the quality was uneven, and foreign merchants were greatly disappointed. The export volume plummeted. Recently, Mr. Zhang Guowei, a tycoon in the Shanghai fur industry, decided to go to the United States in person to exchange opinions with manufacturers there on improving fur exports, and to seek the development of export goods. He made the above remarks at a farewell banquet for his colleagues.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Competition in the Fur Market</h3>
<p>[United Press, Sydney, 28th] Mr. Bellina, a representative of London's fur exporters, recently assured Australia here that Britain would purchase all the sheepskin, rabbit skin, and gray squirrel skin that Australia can supply. Mr. Bellina further stated that Britain hopes to obtain Australia's assistance in restoring London as the world's fur center, replacing New York. Currently, the best furs are all shipped to New York because "only Americans have the money to buy them."</p>
<h3>More American Wheat Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The "H.H. Raymond," managed by Fuli Foreign Firm, arrived from the United States carrying over 8,000 tons of relief wheat. It entered the port the day before yesterday evening and is now docked at the Qichang line in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices See Both Ups and Downs</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Hezhong Sugar Company's fifth batch of sugar for sale plans to deliver one-quarter as spot goods and three-quarters as futures. Under the futures item, three ships will arrive in early July. It is understood that the ships could have arrived in Shanghai earlier, but due to typhoon conditions, the time was delayed. It is now expected that the Hai Zhen and Taipei vessels will arrive first tomorrow (the 1st) and the day after (the 2nd), followed by the Maler vessel somewhat later.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended firm with little fluctuation. The guild's closing price for spot goods was 118,500 yuan for medium-grade white sugar in double bags and 119,500 to 120,000 yuan for single bags. Fifth-batch warehouse receipts were 117,000 yuan, up 4,000 yuan. Road goods for immediate delivery were silver 100,800 yuan, and customs-paid silver was 110,000 to 112,000 yuan, later 100,900 yuan. Numbered goods opened at 100,400 yuan for fresh extraction, Huanggang green at 100,200 yuan, down 500 yuan, Shantou red cotton at 123,400 yuan, and secondary at 120,000 yuan, with 200 bales transacted. Xinghua white several pieces, 128,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Orchid Bamboo Twig Market Opens</h3>
<p>The first batch of new orchid bamboo twigs, arriving in limited quantities this time, opened yesterday with several dozen boxes. The higher prices were 352,000 yuan to 315,000 yuan, and the secondary prices were 277,000 yuan. Early red twigs and dark leaf twigs were about 30% less, varying accordingly.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Patients! Where Do People Go?</h3>
<p>...Collective writing by this newspaper's interview room...</p>
<p>Patients Waver on the Crossroads: Take off-the-shelf medicine? Or seek medical treatment?</p>
<p>When you are sick, you need to take medicine, which is undeniable. But what medicine can actually cure the disease, what medicine is the same as taking nothing, and what medicine will not only have no effect but also harm people? There is a need for a great deal of research in this area. For the first type, if the patient takes the right medicine, and indeed the body recovers health, then there is simply nothing to say. But the latter two situations are the most common and the most dangerous. Here are a few common examples for everyone's reference.</p>
<p>(1) We all know that tuberculosis is the most prevalent and most frightening disease in China, but there is still no specific medicine invented. Unfortunately, if you have this disease, you have to pay extra attention to daily life, nutrition, air, sunlight, and rest more. In addition, please ask a doctor to diagnose and treat. Medication and surgery go hand in hand, so that the tuberculosis bacteria in the patient's body are calcified and automatically stop spreading. It takes a long time to treat this rich man's disease, but the so-called special medicine for lung disease sold on the market is actually only a common medicine for treating respiratory diseases. At best, it contains two kinds of antibacterial medicines, Creosol and Guaiacol (commonly known as Guaiacol). But according to the conclusions of modern biological bacteriologists, tuberculosis is wrapped in a waxy shell, and so far no medicine has been invented that can penetrate this shell, so it can be seen that the effect of antibacterial medicines is very limited.</p>
<p>(2) Mentioning the two words "stomach disease" is another headache. It is both painful and stubborn, and there are particularly many patients. Patients should pay attention to the weather, be moderate in diet, do not eat things that are difficult to digest and irritating, eat more fruits and vegetables, and eat less raw fat and carbonated foods. Most of the stomach medicines currently sold on the market are alkaline, containing baking soda and Atropa preparations to neutralize stomach acid with alkalinity. Atropa itself contains a small amount of atropine, so it has the effect of calming malaria and relieving pain. This method of drinking poison to quench thirst can only be effective for a while and has no hope of curing the disease at all. The result of taking it often is that the stomach becomes numb and unable to secrete gastric acid mucus, leading to ulcers. If the patient's stomach secretion is too weak and stomach acid is too little, then the harm of taking it can be imagined.</p>
<p>(3) Under the strict ban on smoking, drugs to quit smoking arise in response to the times, but no one has ever completely quit because of buying and taking this kind of drug. This type of drug mostly contains sleeping pills and narcotics. Taking it can only be used as a substitute, and taking it often can also become an addiction. Therefore, to quit drugs, you must consult a doctor and inject drugs according to the law and reduce the medicine step by step, otherwise the body will become weaker day by day, and old diseases and new diseases will break out together, and it will be impossible to clean them up.</p>
<p>(4) Sand eye disease is also a disease that Chinese people suffer from a lot, and most of them are caused by lack of attention to hygiene and infection. To treat it, you have to have surgery to remove it. The ingredients of the eye medicines sold on the market are nothing more than boric acid and other medicines. The effect can only treat common eye diseases, but it has no effect on sand eye at all. This point should be paid special attention to.</p>
<p>(5) On the advertising billboards, you can often see medicines that specialize in treating children's diseases. In fact, anyone with a little medical knowledge knows that there has never been a medicine that can cure all diseases. This kind of medicine mainly contains podophyllin and calomel, which can only treat constipation and kill roundworms. Both of these are powerful medicines, and taking too much will inevitably cause poisoning. Pharmaceutical merchants don't understand this point, so "only seek no harm, and don't seek merit." The amount of medicine in the medicine is extremely small, but this also loses its effectiveness.</p>
<p>(6) Everyone knows that syphilis and venereal diseases require injections of old-fashioned needle medicines such as "606" and "914". General slippery doctors vigorously publicize that the roots can be eradicated in a few days or weeks. It is really playing tricks on them. Sometimes, those who suffer from this disease are given a few injections by the doctors, and the sores on the skin slowly metabolize, and the doctors say: "Your disease has been eradicated, and you don't have to see it again in the future." You know, the "outside is strong and the inside is empty", and the blood inside is still poisonous. Therefore, sick people must ask legitimate doctors to diagnose and treat them and check the blood at any time until there is no toxin in the blood at all.</p>
<p>(7) Speaking of tonics, they are really too numerous to mention. What pills, essences, pastes, juices, elements, preparations, and life-saving tonics are all decorations for the rich and have more harm than good, but real ones of value are not easy to find. The so-called general medicinal liquid contains vitamins A, B, C, D, etc., but it is a lie. You must know that the nature of vitamins is that A and D are soluble in oil, and B and C are soluble in water. Then it can be seen that those that contain A and D are all oil-based, and those that contain B and C are all water-based. To mix the four types, except for solids, it must be emulsified, and liquids cannot be done.</p>
<p>(8) There are also many medicines, although they are genuine and live up to their reputation, there are often things that "impersonate" and "change their appearance" to confuse the public. Moreover, if there is any change in the quantity, usage, and nature when applied, all the work will be abandoned. For example, take the famous medicine penicillin. This medicine must be kept at a temperature of ten degrees below zero, otherwise it will easily lose its effectiveness. Even if it is a solvent, if it exceeds seven days after production, it will no longer be effective. Some people often want to buy cheap goods and buy them in large quantities, but the result is an empty joy. In addition, like injecting glucose needles, you must inject 40 cc of 50% each time to be effective, and the amount less than 40 cc is of little use. Serum and antitoxin should also be stored between 5 degrees and 15 degrees. Also, the way of cutting corners and reducing materials in DDT is already an open secret. It is better not to use it than to be fooled.</p>
<p>Finally, we do not want people who are sick to not take medicine because they are afraid that the medicine will be ineffective, but it is always better to be cautious. Some people want to save some money and buy some off-the-shelf medicine to eat, but the result is "trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice." You must know that "money is a small matter, but life is a big matter." If you are sick, ask a legitimate doctor to treat it, and taking medicine for the disease will not necessarily be more expensive than off-the-shelf medicine, and it will be effective soon.</p>

<h3>Weekly Forum: On the Demarcation of Shanghai from the Perspective of Urban Planning</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zukang</p>
<p>Since the Executive Yuan approved the boundary of Shanghai's urban area in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the municipal government only received 17 rural districts in the 17th year. The remaining 13 rural districts were not handed over by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and they were designated as areas where the municipal government would temporarily delay reception. To this day, the case remains unresolved, covering more than ten years. The development of the city and countryside has been greatly affected by this. The villagers in the non-received township hope that the municipal government will take over and build them immediately. Now, at the beginning of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the province and the city continue to discuss the demarcation. I would like to take the starting point of urban planning, objectively analyze and compare, and discuss the principles and practical problems of this appropriate and reasonable solution.</p>
<p>The establishment of modern cities can be regarded as the focus of national or political, cultural, economic, and transportation. The prosperity of the city can be reasonably developed, and the country or the world will benefit from it. This is a very clear principle and does not need to be elaborated in detail. Therefore, in the post-war construction of European and American countries, although great importance is attached to the universal construction of rural areas, special attention is paid to the revival and expansion of cities. The United Kingdom has established a Department of Urban and Rural Construction Planning for urban and rural construction; the United States has provided administrative and financial assistance to urban housing, urban streets, etc. from the federal government during and after the war. As for urban planning, whether in the UK or the US, small cities and villages are often combined and planned together in order to obtain a more perfect design object.</p>
<p>Therefore, the principle of provincial and municipal demarcation should first be based on the consideration of the interests of the entire national politics, economy, culture, and transportation as a prerequisite, secondly, the city should be the center, and the adjacent counties and townships should be its assistance, with the goal of co-gang development, and finally, attention should be paid to not harming the future status of the province's politics, economy, culture, and transportation. These three principles are actually the basis that both parties discussing the provincial and municipal demarcation should adopt in common.</p>
<p>The initial work of Shanghai's urban planning is now being actively carried out by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works. Urban planning refers to "the entire, long-term, and natural physical development plan of a city." The natural construction of a city is more fixed than social construction, so it must have a long-term and complete plan as its goal, so as to avoid the trouble of cutting the feet to fit the shoes and being too late for regrets. The formulation of Shanghai's urban plan is now aiming at a 50-year plan, and then taking a five-year plan and a ten-year plan as the steps to advance. Therefore, when discussing the current area of Shanghai, it is most reasonable to take a 50-year plan as the object. Now, let's discuss the needs of the four points of "population density," "waterline length," "traffic equipment," and "green area and industrial area":</p>
<p>Shanghai's population was 3.8 million in the 25th year of the Republic of China, and according to the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau's survey in April this year, it is currently 3.39 million, excluding the two districts of Tangwan and Zhoupu. (Among them, affected by the war, there is a clear interruption on the population curve.) According to the statistical records of the past 60 years, the future development is estimated, and referring to the Malthusian population theory, the growth of Shanghai's population doubles every 25 years, and quadruples after 50 years, that is, 12 million people. Even if strictly estimated, it cannot be said to be an exaggeration if Shanghai's plan aims at a population of 10 million in the future. As for the population density, there are now more than 200,000 people per square kilometer (Zhejiang Road area in Huangpu Police District and Ximen area in Taishan Police District). According to the urban plan we have drafted, it will be divided into three levels in the future, calculated as (1) 5,000 people, (2) 7,500 people, and (3) 10,000 people per square kilometer. Excessive population density not only hinders hygiene and helps traffic congestion, but also lowers living conditions and increases the causes of crime. Modern urban construction is trending towards the dispersion of population, and it has to be. According to the above three-level distribution, if the area of Shanghai approved in the 16th year of the Republic of China is more than 890 square kilometers, it can only accommodate 7 million people after 50 years. Calculated with a total of 10 million people, there are still 3 million people who must live outside the urban area, some of whom are Shanghai citizens who come to the city in the morning and scatter to the four villages in the evening, and some of whom are people from satellite cities and towns around Shanghai. From the perspective of population density, if the urban area of Shanghai cannot expand its scope, it should at least be in accordance with the regulations of the 16th year of the Republic of China to meet the actual needs, first.</p>
<p>The prosperity of Shanghai is very dependent on the development of the Yangtze River and Huangpu River water lines. The throughput of Shanghai Port reached the highest record in the 19th year of the Republic of China, with a total tonnage of 38 million tons of imported and exported ships, ranking approximately seventh or eighth among the world's ports, and being the largest port in our country. If we compare Wusong Baoshan to Shanghai's throat, then the Huangpu River is no less than Shanghai's esophagus and stomach. Now, Baoshan City could not be rationally divided and assigned to Shanghai due to the relationship between the county seat in the 16th year of the Republic of China. The upstream of the Huangpu River, such as Caohang, Tangwan, Beiqiao, Zhuanqiao, Maqiao, Xinzhuang, Qibao, and Minhang, are also among those temporarily delayed. The existing pier waterline in Shanghai is about 12,000 meters. According to the 50-year development plan, the throughput of Shanghai Port can reach approximately 100 million tons per year, and its pier waterline should be about 30,000 meters, which must make full use of both sides of the Huangpu River. From the perspective of waterline length, the area of Shanghai should include Baoshan County into the urban area, and the two banks of the Huangpu River should at least still be in accordance with the settlement of the 16th year of the Republic of China, second.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of a city is greatly related to water, land, and air transportation. The coordination of railway lines and stations in Shanghai's urban area has failed to meet the ideal and hinders the development of various industrial and commercial transportation industries in the city. The urban plan proposed by the former Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works also included suggestions for changing the money and location of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway lines and stations, which was requested by the former Shanghai Municipal Government to the former Ministry of Railways for consideration. However, due to the limitation of funds and the restriction of the environment, the central and local governments failed to cooperate effectively, and the plan could not be realized, which is a pity. Now that the concessions have been recovered and various transportation technologies have made significant progress, the plan may need to be revised, but it seems that the railway freight terminal should be moved from Maigen Road to West Shanghai, and the railway passenger terminal should be rebuilt or slightly moved outward, all of which are necessary for the gang, which is closely related to the urban area. If Yanghang, Dachang, and Zhenru must still belong to the urban area, it is easier to configure. Other places such as Longhua and Minhang in South Shanghai, Hongqiao, Qibao, and Xinzhuang in West Shanghai, and Zhoupu in Pudong, or where the airport is located, or where the railway passes, or where the highway leads, are all important transportation areas, and should still belong to the Shanghai urban area. From the perspective of traffic equipment, the Shanghai urban area should be in accordance with the original regulations of the 16th year of the Republic of China, third.</p>
<p>In the built-up areas of Shanghai, such as the former Public Concession, the former French Concession, and Hongkou, there are many shops, houses are lined up, and the population density is very high, and parks and open spaces are insufficient. According to our survey and statistics, the existing public area is about 1,000 acres, equivalent to more than 60 hectares. In terms of the built-up area, it is about 6.7/1000 of the area. If the whole city is taken as the unit, it is only 8/10,000 of the area. In the future, the layout of the garden should be in accordance with modern urban design, with more "green belts" and park open spaces, etc., and the rural areas that have not yet been built are most suitable for the use of this ideal layout, that is, the more rural areas join the urban area, the more fully the garden layout can be, and the more it conforms to the ideal of beauty and hygiene. According to the ideal of London's post-war plan, only the park area is calculated to be 4 acres per 1,000 people. If Shanghai's population is 10 million in the next 50 years, the park area should be 40,000 acres, equivalent to 16,000 hectares, which is more than two or three hundred times more than the current situation?</p>
<p>As for the location of Shanghai factories, since being occupied by the enemy and puppet management, there has been a trend of gradually encroaching on residential areas, even in West Shanghai. This poses a great threat to the health of residents. Many of these factories are dyeing and weaving factories or leather factories, and the sewage discharged is particularly harmful to hygiene. It is urgent to determine the zoning method, order them to improve, or even move them back. As for the future of Shanghai's industry, once the port and railway are improved and expanded, it will be booming. The land required for the factory base is also unlimited. The planning of the industrial area is already urgent. From the perspective of "green area" and industrial area, the area of Shanghai should also maintain the regulations stipulated in the old case of the 16th year of the Republic of China, fourth.</p>
<p>In short, if the area of Shanghai is received in accordance with the case of the 16th year of the Republic of China, it will be equivalent to the area of Beijing, which is far less than the major cities in Europe and the United States, such as New York, London, and Chicago. If it is too small, the city will be stretched and unable to expand, and the neighboring counties will also suffer from it. It is necessary to give it a reasonable and appropriate area, at least as the original case of the 16th year of the Republic of China, so that not only can the city have a place to develop, but also the neighboring satellite counties and villages will benefit from it. At present, the advanced countries in Europe and the United States have progressed from urban planning to regional planning and national planning. Their political regions are gradually trying to cooperate with economic regions. Then, the demarcation of Shanghai's area should start from the perspective of the revival and construction of the entire country and nation, and strive to promote the prosperity and development of our country's first port, first city, and its surrounding counties and villages. It is clear. (35.6.28)</p>
<h3>Private Hospitals: A Disguised Form of Hotel</h3>
<p>Opening up the telephone book, you will definitely be surprised by the number of hospitals in Shanghai. Large and small, from the quite complete Hongqiao Sanatorium, which covers all departments, to hospitals specializing in the treatment of body odor, there are more than 200 private hospitals alone.</p>
<p>Among these more than 200 hospitals, less than one-third have beds. There is a "hospital" on Tibet Road with only one room. A board wall is sandwiched on the front part along the road, leaving a space of more than a foot wide. A small window is opened on the left, which is the number queuing place, and the door to enter the "hospital" is on the right. The person in charge of registration is the only nurse in this hospital, and the person in charge of this hospital is also the only doctor in this hospital. The doctor's business does not seem to be thriving, but it is still maintained on Tibet Road, where land is as valuable as gold. Most of these "smallest" private hospitals are concentrated on Tibet Road, and some are also on Jiujiang Road and Hankou Road, mainly specializing in the treatment of venereal diseases.</p>
<p>A little larger than these hospitals are hospitals that have equipment and sometimes more than one doctor, but no wards. This kind of "hospital" is actually equivalent to the "clinic" of several doctors. Many dental hospitals seem to be able to be classified into this category.</p>
<p>Opening a Private Hospital Is the Same as Opening a Hotel</p>
<p>However, when people mention private hospitals in Shanghai, they always refer to those luxurious sanatoriums with elegantly decorated gardens as soon as you enter, and two or three patients sitting in rattan chairs on the lawn to recuperate. In terms of the high level of doctors and the relatively thoughtful nursing, these private hospitals are mostly better than general public hospitals. The wards in these hospitals are also more comfortable, so they are more popular with those dignitaries and big-name celebrities. And what those private hospitals welcome are this group of generous patrons. A doctor who has worked in a very famous private sanatorium for four or five years said: "Objectively speaking, hospitals don't make a lot of money in medicine. In other words, opening a private hospital is similar to opening a hotel.</p>
<p>This is an Enterprise, Not "Rescuing People"</p>
<p>He said: Sometimes, these hospitals will also "go bankrupt." When patients come in, they pay a little money, but later, they can't afford it, and the hospital has to recognize the bad luck.</p>
<p>"Then, people who can't pay a sum of money when they enter the hospital have no hope of seeing a doctor at all?" the reporter asked.</p>
<p>He shrugged and said, "Why don't public hospitals have better equipment? Can't they have the help of the Federation?"</p>
<p>He repeated that running a private hospital is an enterprise, at least the "hospital owner" believes so.</p>
<p>Words such as "saving all sentient beings" and "rescuing people" shrank back from my mouth.</p>
<p>The Hospital Is Much Quieter, So It Doesn't Rent Hotel Rooms</p>
<p>He also told me that in the enemy-occupied era, one day a relative of a pseudo-official suddenly came to the hospital and insisted on booking all the wards for the servants of this rich patient to live in. As a result, the hospital cobbled together and gave him ten rooms, and the patients naturally had to move to other hospitals.</p>
<p>Perhaps because he saw that I was a little surprised, he said, "There are a lot of empty rooms in other hospitals! Some people will book long rooms in the hospital. When there are really patients, these rooms can still be vacated - as long as you have enough friendship with the people in the hospital."</p>
<p>The reporter took the opportunity to ask him why those guests who booked long rooms didn't book hotel rooms since they didn't have any illnesses? The doctor smiled mysteriously and said, "Isn't the hospital a little quieter?"</p>
<h3>Concerning Public Hospitals</h3>
<p>In today's world where rice is like pearls and firewood like cassia, if you are unfortunately visited by the demon of illness, you will undoubtedly worry about which hospital is best to go to, both to quickly alleviate the pain and to minimize financial losses. From any perspective, public hospitals with a long history and large scale would be more to your liking. However, Shanghai has several public hospitals, so what are the circumstances?</p>
<p>From the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road in the western district to the China Hospital in Tilanqiao in the eastern district, there are the Sino-American Hospital on Baker Road, the Hongren Hospital on Beijing Road, the Renji Hospital on Shandong Road, the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road, as well as the Municipal First, Second, Third, and Fourth Hospitals, and the Gongji Hospital, from whose five-story balcony you can look out over the scenery of the Suzhou Creek... All these hospitals can be divided into three categories according to their nature: those run by charitable organizations, those run by churches, and those run by government agencies. They all bear important social healthcare responsibilities to varying degrees. I truly cannot imagine what fate the citizens of Shanghai would encounter if these hospitals did not exist in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Now, let us make a rough comparison of these hospitals: they all have magnificent buildings, complete equipment, and white-clad nurses shuttling back and forth endlessly. If one must mention some distinctive features, then the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road has the most tranquil environment, the Sino-American Hospital has the most complete equipment, the lawn in front of the Gongji Hospital is the most pleasing, but its prices are considered the most aristocratic.</p>
<p>Currently, the outpatient fees of various hospitals range from around four hundred yuan to one thousand yuan. The Gongji Hospital has a so-called "specialist outpatient clinic" that costs five thousand yuan per visit. The inpatient prices also vary greatly. For example, a special ward at Renji Hospital costs 16,000 yuan per day, and a first-class ward costs 14,000 yuan. A first-class ward at Hongren Hospital costs 24,000 yuan, while Gongji Hospital charges as much as 35,000 yuan. However, most hospitals offer preferential treatment to ordinary people, so the prices of third-class wards are very different from those of first and second-class wards, usually around 2,000 yuan. Even the most aristocratic Gongji Hospital has "beds for the common people," although the daily room rate is still as high as 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Almost all public hospitals have many common shortcomings, the most prominent of which are: first, when patients enter the hospital, they must prepay a huge "deposit." The first-class wards require approximately 300,000 to 400,000, while the third-class wards require about 100,000 yuan. Due to the strict enforcement of this regulation, many tragedies have occurred in the past. Often, some poor and critically ill patients are unable to pay this huge fee, and the hospital refuses to admit them, even to the point of watching them die without offering assistance.</p>
<p>Second, the doctors in charge of general outpatient clinics are mostly less experienced, or interns from medical schools just starting out. Their abilities are poor, and because there are so many people seeking treatment, diagnoses are inevitably hasty and careless. If you have a fever, they give you some baking soda; if you have a cough, they give you some quinine pills; if you have a skin disease, they give you some sulfur ointment. Patients come with great hope, wait in crowded waiting rooms for a long time, but in the end only receive prescriptions that they themselves understand, inevitably leading to complaints.</p>
<p>Third, what hospitalized patients need most is the care and comfort of nurses, but many "misses" do not seem to understand the meaning of service and treat patients as bothersome things. Especially in third-class wards, it is common for patients to be left to groan unattended or to be unable to get a cup of plain water.</p>
<p>What has been said above may inevitably be criticized for being overly demanding. In fact, we sincerely hope that all public hospitals in Shanghai can constantly find ways to improve, strive for progress, and extend benefits to the general public, in order to achieve their great goal of benefiting mankind.</p>

<h3>Factions, Factions, Factions! British, American, German, Japanese, and French Medical Circles</h3>
<p>On the surface, doctors appear to be a type of freelance professional. But the inside story is that there are many factions, each distinct. The factionalism among the factions is quite profound. According to people in the medical community, the most obvious divisions can be divided into three factions:</p>
<p>British and American Faction</p>
<p>One is the British and American faction: This faction accounts for more than half of the number of doctors in the country. It is said that there are many tributaries under this large artery. In terms of foreign countries, the most prominent are the Harvard and Hopkins factions. Domestically, it is also divided into Xiangya, Shanghai, Qilu, and Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) factions. This major artery can be said to occupy a leading position in the domestic medical community.</p>
<p>German and Japanese Faction is a Large Vein</p>
<p>Second is the German and Japanese vein: If the British and American faction is currently the main artery of the domestic medical community, then the German and Japanese faction is precisely a major vein. The number of doctors belonging to this large system is also sufficient to compete with the British and American faction. Among the German and Japanese factions, graduates from Hamburg and Tokyo Imperial University are the most famous abroad. Domestically, there are also Tongji, Tongde, and Southeast universities. The factionalism among the schools under this large system is not as profound as that of the British and American faction.</p>
<p>French Faction Weak</p>
<p>Third is the French faction: This faction is weaker. This is largely because the number of doctors from France is not as large as the previous two factions. Aurora University in this city is the representative college of this faction in China.</p>
<p>An example of this might be helpful. Suppose a doctor from the Harvard system of the British and American faction becomes the president of a hospital, he would always find a way to replace all the department directors with Harvard people. To put it more clearly, if a patient consults a doctor from the Harvard system for his initial surgery, it is absolutely impossible to switch to a doctor from the Hopkins system for follow-up care if the illness is not cured. Because the doctor from the Hopkins system, after finding out about your consultation history, will definitely shake his head at you without hesitation and leave with his medical bag. This may seem unbelievable, but similar events are constantly playing out in the medical community today!</p>
<p>Even within the British and American faction, the various small tributaries are clearly distinguished. The gulf between the British and American, German and Japanese, and French factions is so deep that readers can easily imagine it.</p>
<h3>Factionalism Becomes Argumentativeness</h3>
<p>In addition to these three major factions, there are also many who practice medicine after apprenticing as pharmacists and nurses. These individuals, after practicing with a doctor for more than three years, can obtain a "Tong" character medical license from the Ministry of Health, or pass a qualification examination.</p>
<p>Some say that the formation of these factions is due to different research systems. The diagnosis and prescription for the same symptoms have certain steps and methods, which cannot be disturbed in the slightest. Others say that factionalism is too deep, inevitably leading to argumentativeness. For the sake of the patients' welfare, we hope that the former is in line with social reality.</p>
<h3>The Anguish of Mothers</h3>
<p>Unable to Bear the Huge Delivery Costs, What Decisions Can Be Made Regarding Abandoning Infants?</p>
<p>Walking on the streets of Shanghai, one often sees various hospital signs, especially those of "obstetric hospitals." The Health Bureau is trying to compile statistics, but only a few hospitals have registered. Information about the facilities and fees inside the hospitals is naturally even more difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>A Wide Variety – Sixty or Seventy</p>
<p>According to the reporter's rough estimate: there are no less than sixty or seventy obstetric hospitals of all kinds, large and small, in Shanghai. In addition, most hospitals have an obstetrics department. Each of these many hospitals is different. After the reporter's interviews, all parties feel that Shanghai's obstetric hospitals can be roughly divided into the following four levels:</p>
<p>The So-called Super-Level – Twenty Gold Bars – Named "Super-Level" by the Reporter</p>
<p>Naturally, the environment is extraordinary, the equipment is extraordinary, the doctors are extraordinary, the surgery is extraordinary, and the fees are also extraordinary – twenty large gold bars! You may not believe it, but the reporter can remind you: this is Shanghai after all! Nightclubs that sell a Western meal for 200,000 yuan are still "fully booked" every day, let alone obstetric hospitals? That being said, those who can experience this extraordinary surgery are, after all, a minority of the minority. At the same time, these "super-level" hospitals and "super-level" doctors can live a leisurely and luxurious life by performing extraordinary surgery once or twice a year.</p>
<p>Special-Level Hospitals Charge Exorbitantly</p>
<p>Hospitals belonging to this level are not uncommon in Shanghai, and they already give the general public a rather "aristocratic" impression! Their average delivery fee is 300,000 yuan, and hospitalization fees, medical expenses, etc. are all paid separately. Difficult births are doubled, and of course, registration fees must be prepaid. The hospital is responsible for nursing before and after childbirth to ensure the safety of the mother and child. Most of the doctors inside are more reliable in terms of academic theory and experience, but how can ordinary people afford such huge costs?</p>
<p>Mid-Level Hospitals – Novices Delivering Babies</p>
<p>Speaking of mid-level, these are the most common type of hospitals, with the largest number of people hospitalized for childbirth. The delivery fee is directly proportional to the room level, with first-class wards charging about 20,000 yuan per day and delivery fees at 50,000 yuan. In addition, there are also separate charges for labor room rental, surgery fees, material fees, childcare fees, etc. The total amount will not be a small number. However, it should be noted that most of the deliveries are performed by midwives in the hospital, because according to the regulations of obstetrics schools, they must have at least twenty internship experiences before the summer vacation. The objects of these many student internships are the mothers in the hospital, and at the beginning of the internship, the doctors only provide instructions and supervision from the side. However, there are inevitably some shortcomings in deliveries performed by novices. At this time, you can designate a doctor, as long as you are willing to spend more money (usually double the fee). Therefore, the mothers in the third-class wards who cannot afford to pay become the objects of their internships.</p>
<p>Cheap Solicitation Leads to Skillful Extortion</p>
<p>The "inferior level" that the reporter refers to does not refer to the hospital's equipment. There are many obstetric hospitals in Shanghai that have very impressive facades and many branches, but their content is despicable. They use the lowest delivery fees as a selling point, and use labor-inducing injections, pain-relieving injections, and blood-boosting injections as extortion tactics. This is already an open secret. The most terrible thing is that those so-called obstetricians are there every day as butchers of countless pure little lives! According to a famous obstetrician in Shanghai, performing an abortion for an unmarried woman is a very dangerous thing, but these inferior doctors only recognize money, and they do not care about life at all. They are guilty, but this evil society tolerates them committing crimes, allowing them to continue killing people every day!</p>
<p>Serving the People and Benefiting Mothers</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter wants to introduce an obstetrics hospital that truly serves the common people – Shanghai Civilian Women and Children's Hospital at 995 Kang Nao Road. The hospital was founded in the 28th year of the Republic of China and is now largely financially responsible by Dr. Wang Yi Jun. The hospital is located in a commoners and factory district, and the diagnosis and treatment is especially eager. Most of the doctors in the hospital are devout Christians. They serve the people in the spirit of Jesus' sacrifice. Those who are truly poor can request a full waiver of fees. Recently, many mothers introduced by the "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA)" have come to the hospital. In addition to waiving all fees, they also provide meals. Each mother eats eight ounces of noodles per meal, and the flour is allocated by the CRRRA. In addition, there are also milk powder and medicines. When poor and sick mothers are discharged from the hospital, the hospital also provides some milk powder.</p>
<p>The Problem of Abandoned Babies is the Most Troublesome</p>
<p>What they currently feel most powerless to do is to accommodate infants, because there are many impoverished mothers who cannot afford to raise their children. They often heartlessly abandon their own flesh and blood. At this time, the Civilian Women and Children's Hospital has no choice but to take them in for delivery and nursing, but because childcare facilities are still lacking, they can only give them futile sympathy. Dr. Wu Rongying, who has served in the hospital for more than five years, told the reporter: "I really don't understand, since God loves everyone, why does he allow such a disparity between the rich and the poor? Wealthy people love to be comfortable and can leave their children to nannies, but poor women, who are also mothers, have to grit their teeth and heartlessly abandon their own sons!"</p>
<h3>Social Services – Answering Readers' Questions</h3>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(1) Zhao Lanfen asks: Editor, I am a 24-year-old woman who has not received education since childhood. At the age of 18, I married a man surnamed Yan from the same village, who is a chauffeur, on the orders of my parents. He became unemployed just two months after the marriage. Because of the pressure of life, I had to work as a maid. My husband is a vagrant by nature, gluttonous, and lazy. Sometimes when he has some money, he always squanders it outside, and sometimes he doesn't come home for several months. He doesn't want to pay for his parents and all the expenses at home. When I argue with him, he swears and beats me. I have no choice but to endure and go home, hoping that he will realize his mistakes. Now I have several doubts, please help me find a solution: 1. Is the husband's failure to provide for his wife a reason for divorce? 2. The husband is now cohabiting with a prostitute, who is willing to use the money she earns from prostitution to support him and live together as a couple. Can I catch them in the act of adultery? 3. Does a divorce require the consent of both parties, or can a divorce be filed unilaterally?</p>
<p>[Answer from lawyer Fu Kuangling] (1) If it is malicious abandonment that is still ongoing, it can be a reason for requesting a divorce; (2) Yes; (3) If one of the spouses has any of the circumstances listed in Article 1052 of the Civil Code, the other party may request a divorce from the court.</p>
<p>(2) Lu Zhongli asks: (A) A man and (B) A woman have been married for seven years and have no children. (B) The woman also has mental illness and cannot manage the household. Now (C) A woman is introduced by relatives to marry (A). (B) Also agrees, and the parents of (A), (B), and (C) all agree. If (A) marries (C), (B) may appeal to (A) for bigamy. I don't know if it will be legally effective. If (A) sues (B) for divorce because she has a neurological problem and cannot have children, I don't know if it will be legally effective?</p>
<p>[Answer from lawyer Fu Kuangling] Man A may not marry woman C until after divorcing woman B. As for the inability to have children, it is not sufficient to constitute a reason for divorce. However, if woman B has a serious and incurable mental illness, man A may request the court to divorce her.</p>
<p>(3) Liu Junmin asks: There is someone named A, who was introduced by a friend a few years ago to meet a woman named B. However, they did not go through the marriage procedures. Only one day they invited relatives and friends to a banquet and announced that they were married to woman B. Now, due to disagreements, they intend to break off the relationship. Please ask (1) Is this kind of marriage legal? (2) If you want to divorce, do you need to hire a lawyer to go through legal procedures?</p>
<p>[Answer from lawyer Fu Kuangling] (1) If there was a public ceremony at the time and two or more witnesses, it can be considered a legal marriage. (2) If the divorce is by mutual consent, it should be done in writing and should have the signatures of two or more witnesses. These witnesses are not limited to lawyers.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Lies</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>There was such a news item in the evening paper:</p>
<p>A certain day, a certain meeting. In addition to reporters from various newspapers, the guests included... and many foreign guests. Elegant and luxurious, some wore silk stockings. The meeting was chaired by Ms. ×××, Ms. ××× gave a speech, and then Ms. ××× gave a speech, saying that in the face of high cost of living and widespread disasters, our women should take the lead in advocating frugality...</p>
<p>"Elegant and luxurious, some wore silk stockings," "in the face of high cost of living and widespread disasters, our women should take the lead in advocating frugality"... It feels rather incongruous to read.</p>
<p>Looking at the following text, I thought there would definitely be "those wearing silk stockings took them off," or "those who were elegant and luxurious looked ashamed," but I don't know if the reporter was being euphemistic, there was no description of this.</p>
<p>I once heard a story: A labor activist was sitting on a rickshaw, stomping his feet and scolding the rickshaw puller, saying: You are pulling so slowly, delaying my business. Do you know that I am going to attend a workers' congress?</p>
<p>Unity of knowledge and action, practicing what you preach, otherwise, it's all lies.</p>
<h3>Summer on the Banks of the Jialing River</h3>
<p>— Shi Bei</p>
<p>The sound of cicadas is like the flowing water in a stream, small and slender, penetrating into the heart through the eardrum, unintentionally with a sliver of coolness flowing through the whole body.</p>
<p>Seeing the French parasol trees on the streets of Shanghai, green and crystalline, tender and dripping, I want to linger for a moment; but the lightning-like cars and the crowd of pedestrians make it impossible for me to stop. At such times, I think of last year's summer on the banks of the Jialing River.</p>
<p>There are no typhoons blown in from overseas on the banks of the Jialing River, making it almost impossible for people to open their eyes. The wind in summer there is like flying catkins scattered from the sky in the basin, turning over the mountain gorges, skimming across the river surface, and then leisurely coming to you, with the rich aroma of soil, beckoning you to return to the embrace of nature. At this time, you are truly open-minded—without a trace of worries, without a trace of the troubles of urban materialism, carefree to receive the coolness of the wind and the clarity of summer.</p>
<p>Right there on the long embankment lined with French parasol trees, you lie on a Sichuan-style bamboo chair, sitting alone, and no one else comes to disturb you. From the gaps between some low river trees, you watch the boats in the river. They, like you, only let the forces of nature govern them, slowly letting the wind send them away; some large black civilian boats, with dozens of naked-shouldered trackers, crawling down, pulling long cables. In this way, you can appreciate Du Fu's famous line "Late sun, slowly watching the brocade cables pulled," and you will also admire their perseverance in making a living.</p>
<p>There are no ice pops that chill the tongue, but there is Tuo tea in the teahouse, or sweet tea from North Hot Spring. You can ask the "little total" to bring you a cup; the clear fragrance mixed with a faint sweetness, this is the famous product of Sichuan. Sipping slowly, you feel that it is much more wonderful than the stimulating taste of ice cream. You can never find an ideal coffee shop in the city, but when you see this simple teahouse on the riverbank, with two or three "Sichuan kids" busy with hospitality, even if you sit far away from the teahouse, you don't need to call out, they will naturally come diligently to fill your cup from time to time; you enjoy the blessing of tasting tea, but you don't feel the air of sitting in a teahouse. Such a mood and place, I always think, is the most ideal coffee shop.</p>
<p>The Jialing River never has the surging waves of the Huangpu River, nor is it filled with warships and foreign ships. The river transport that the people of Sichuan call "foreign boats" in the river are just small-sized passenger ships on the inner waterways of the Minsheng Company. They fly small flags, coming from downstream and falling to upstream, like a comb, freely coming and going in the heart of the river.</p>
<p>The long sound of cicadas can float from across the river. You chant a tune and can harmonize with this cicada song. How can you hear the sound of cicadas in the city? The sound of cicadas is like the flowing water in a stream, small and woven long, penetrating into the heart through the eardrum, unintentionally with a sliver of coolness flowing through the whole body.</p>
<p>After half a day, when you see the shadow of the parasol trees stretching out slender, and two or three returning crows have also flashed in the river, you can slowly return to the small house by the river.</p>
<p>In summer, the climate in Sichuan often rains at night. Pushing open the small window, listening to the sound of rain rustling in front of the window, embracing the thin quilt, you seem to hear someone whispering Li Shangyin's famous lines:</p>
<p>"You ask when I will return, there is no date set,"</p>
<p>"Bashan night rain swells the autumn pond;</p>
<p>When will we trim the western window candle together,</p>
<p>And talk again of the Bashan night rain."</p>
<p>Good, now I am living in Shanghai and reminiscing about "Bashan." I think those who sigh in Chongqing about the "difficulty of traveling" can also linger for a while longer.</p>
<h3>A Record of Chiang Ching-kuo</h3>
<p>— Han Tianrong</p>
<p>The scorching sun hangs high in the sky, sweat pouring like a waterfall. Looking toward the Northeast, turning back to Gan Nan, the same oppressive heat pervades. Lowering my head in contemplation, the image of the young statesman Chiang Ching-kuo appears before my eyes.</p>
<p>During the war, New Gan Nan was a paradise in the Southeast rear, and many wandering youths had thrown themselves into its embrace; many foreign friends were also willing to spend their foreign lives there. Three years ago, I first came to Gan Nan, and by chance, spent more than two months of summer life with Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo, learning a lot of rich knowledge.</p>
<p>I don't emphasize or exaggerate. As he himself said, Chiang Ching-kuo is an ordinary person. A sturdy body, neither tall nor short, often wearing a black leather hat of a New Gan Nan public servant, dressed in a uniform of safe and stable blue, a smile on his face, either riding a bicycle or slowly wandering the streets of Ganzhou.</p>
<p>He has no bureaucratic airs, let alone the temper of a young master. He loves Ganzhou and likes to be close to the common people. At the entrance of the New Gan Nan Road Commissioner's Office, there are no stern, armed soldiers like in ordinary government offices, but instead two young unarmed Boy Scouts? The bulletin of the Commissioner's Office does not contain the phrases "etc. by order..." in official documents, but instead popular and sincere public language. This approach is intended to make the general public thoroughly understand government orders and get close to the government, which will certainly have a great effect. At the same time, in order to avoid being deceived, it is stipulated that the public will be received at the Commissioner's Office every Wednesday. At that time, on the roads of New Gan Nan, an endless stream of people, supporting the old and carrying the young, were marching toward the entrance of the Commissioner's Office. They were full of hope that the wise officials would be able to solve their difficulties and redress their grievances. According to several examples I have asked about in the past, Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo has indeed never given them empty promises.</p>
<p>Ganzhou is a gathering place for young people, and you can see countless students rushing to various schools. Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo loves young people, so Ganzhou has become the base camp for wandering young people. There, not only can they solve their daily lives, but also get great help in terms of schooling and employment. The hearts of wanderers are soothed with kindness, and they will not feel much desolation in a foreign land. Life School, Hugang, and the Jiangxi Branch of the Youth Corps are all residences for wandering young people. I also once lived in the university dormitory established by Mr. Chiang, and personally enjoyed the preferential treatment he gave to wanderers, "Chiang Ching-kuo is my brother, and therefore your brother." Young people who have been to Ganzhou all have the same feelings as Mr. Chiang Wei-kuo.</p>
<p>The historical facts of past hardships and struggles have forged Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo into a resolute, pragmatic, unafraid of violence, and persevering person. When he was in Russia, because he had no support and no place to live, he lived by sleeping in the trash. This difficult situation did not weaken him, on the contrary, it made him realize the bitterness of the world and laid the foundation for his future basic political concepts. He worked while studying, and in addition to his normal official duties, he also read books for two or three hours every day. According to the person closest to him, he told me: "His work has never been interrupted for a day." From this, we can see Mr. Chiang's perseverance.</p>

<p>News Snippets</p>
<h3>Famous Courtesan Dies; Pimps Send Her Off</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of rice in Shanghai has fluctuated again, and the black market is rampant. Rice shops claim that there is no rice supply, but if you ask someone you know well, you can buy it for 66,000 yuan per dan. Our view on this matter: it can be said that "wildfires cannot burn them out; the spring breeze blows and they are born again."</p>
<p>A famous courtesan in Zhangshu Back Street, Jiangxi, died of illness. On the day of her funeral, the funeral procession passed through the streets, and thirty or forty people attended the funeral, most of whom were pimps. A few words can give a glimpse of the prosperous scene of the famous courtesan's life, with a constant stream of people and carriages at her door.</p>
<p>In front of the Chenghuang Temple in Suixi County, Guangdong, there is a couplet written by the former Qing scholar Chen Qiaosen:</p>
<p>"The yamen runners there are not ghosts,</p>
<p>The yamen here does not want money."</p>
<p>Today, when we read it, it seems necessary to add a "?" to each line, saying "The yamen runners there are not ghosts? The yamen here does not want money?" It is easy to see the King of Hell, but difficult to deal with the little devils.</p>
<p>On the streets of Guiyang, rickshaw pullers and horse-drawn carriages are racing side by side. We express our twelve-point sympathy for the ancient and simple mountain people, but when we think about how far apart the distance between "man and beast" is, we can't help but feel inexplicably sad!</p>
<p>"Thousands of rickshaw pullers in Changsha City, because of sluggish business, mobilized to destroy all the buses running on the streets. The military police opened fire to suppress them, killing and wounding more than a dozen people." This is another tragedy related to rickshaw pullers, and it is also a contradictory phenomenon in the current society. Ancient China needs mechanical industry to revive and build, but the ancient people need to maintain the continuation of life under high living pressure with cheap labor. Therefore, we only consider this unfortunate event to be the sorrow of the laggards!</p>
<p>The puppet mayor of Tianjin, Wen Shizhen, was sentenced to death by the Hebei High Court on the 24th. Judge Sun's accent was too heavy, and Wen mistakenly heard it as four or ten years in court. When he walked out of the courtroom, his face was ruddy and his attitude was calm. He asked the bailiff, "Is it four years? Is it ten years?" He was quite proud at the time. The bailiff told him that it was a death sentence, and he bowed his head in silence. Wen can be said to have been smart all his life, but confused for a moment. How could he not know that he who commits many evil deeds will bring about his own destruction?</p>
<h3>Reminiscences of Jiulongpo</h3>
<p>— Chen Xunjie</p>
<p>The Site of Jiaotong University in Chongqing</p>
<p>As a person like me who likes tranquility, returning to this noisy and bustling big city cannot help but make me often recall the tranquility, beauty, and loveliness of Jiulongpo!</p>
<p>Jiulongpo is more than ten kilometers away from Chongqing, on the west side of the city, and can be reached directly by the Liangjiu Highway. If you start from Lianglukou, and if the car does not break down halfway, in about an hour, you will pass through the winding mountain roads, through several twists and turns, uphill and downhill, and slowly see the clear white water of the Yangtze River. When the car reaches the last stop, this is Jiulongpo. Jiulongpo is on the riverside. Here, you can stay on the beach and watch the rolling eastward flow of the river, the various ships coming and going, look at the factory in Lijiatuo across the river, and look far at the birds circling in the sky...</p>
<p>This is the only way from Chongqing City to Haitangxi and Guiyang. Jiulongpo Riverside is a ferry crossing. From early morning to night, there are dozens of jeeps, cars, and heavy trucks crossing the river every day.</p>
<p>In fact, the name Jiulongpo is probably due to a nearby small town called Jiulongpu. Near this ferry crossing, there is a mountain slope with a large upward and downward slope, and this small station on the slope is named Jiulongpo. Speaking of Jiulongpu, there are twenty or thirty shops, restaurants, noodle shops, tea houses, and other grocery stores, dirty streets, and dilapidated low houses. In the morning, this is a small open space, and after the rain, the mud pit is even more filthy!</p>
<p>After passing Yangjiaping on the highway bus, you can soon slowly see a small town from the car window. In a turn, the entire face of the small town is in front of you. There are only a few shops on the roadside, but the air here is more lively than Yangjiaping. This town is called Huangtongping. One stop past here is Jiulongpo. In other words, this is the last two stops of the Liangjiu Highway. Across the road from the town, is the school building of the National Jiaotong University during the Anti-Japanese War!</p>
<p>(If you already know very well, then you know that if you get off at Huangjueping, you can walk to the school in a few steps. Otherwise, you will definitely take it all the way to Jiulongpo, and then walk back a section of the road to get to the school. Correctly speaking, Jiaotong University is in Huangjueping, but perhaps because the reputation of Jiulongpo is greater than that of Huangjueping, as long as you talk about Jiulongpo, you also know that it is the location of Jiaotong University.)</p>
<p>Originally, this was a desolate place, but since Jiaotong University moved here, this small town has also risen with it. There are restaurants, noodle shops, tea rooms, candy stores, and cigarette shops. They are all doing business for the students. Here, almost all of them are Jiaotong University students. This is Jiaotong University's small world.</p>
<p>The whole of Jiulongpo does not have as many people as the Shapingba school district, so it is not as lively. This place is shrouded in the atmosphere of the countryside. Tranquility, elegance, beauty, and leisure are good places to study with peace of mind, and good places to concentrate on research.</p>
<p>The highway passes in front of the school gate. After crossing a small mountain depression, passers-by can see the neat houses. The first thing that catches the eye is probably Huangjueping, the factory building across the street; a few steps further, is Jiaotong University, probably also the most beautiful auditorium in the entire Jiulongpo. It stands tall on the roadside, showing the heroic posture of Jiaotong University standing still during the Anti-Japanese War. It shows the entire spirit of Jiaotong University. Inside is the Wenzhi Hall, which commemorates Mr. Tang Wenzhi and can accommodate nearly a thousand people. Commemorative weeks, celebrity lectures, plays, and movies are all held here. At the same time, this is also the heart of Jiaotong University, the location of all administrative offices.</p>
<p>Next to the auditorium, rows of bungalows are the classrooms for the students. Behind the auditorium, rows and rows are the dormitories for the students. Further back, on the small earthen mountain, are the residences of the professors and the dormitories for the female students. Overall, the houses are very simple, but they are neatly arranged in rows and columns, and in the morning light and sunset, they especially show the beauty of the bungalows. This place once hid a part of the essence of China, and this place was once where more than 1,500 young students studied.</p>
<p>The jagged mountain peaks are layered one after another from far to near. On clear days, you can see the rolling eastward flow of the river, contrasting with the earthy color of the uneven foothills. Water, mountains, flowers, trees, birds, the azure sky, and floating dark clouds. A gentle breeze blows from the fields, and you will doubt that you are no longer in the world.</p>
<p>By evening, this place becomes even more lovely. Dotted lights, in this long dark night, extend its infinite light, representing the light near Jiulongpo!</p>
<p>In the sunset, students gather in groups of three or five, chatting and laughing, strolling on the road. Walking out of the school gate to the right, you can go to Jiulongpo, and to the left, you can go to Yangjiaping. The breeze blowing from the valley brings the free and comfortable atmosphere of the fields, and also sends away the students' exhaustion all day long!</p>
<p>On a moonlit night, after finishing homework, you walk out of the dormitory with two or three close friends, wandering under the moonlight. Remembering the mountains and rivers of the motherland and the long-separated homeland, a piece of moonlight mountain scenery, a gentle sigh, will vibrate the entire space. If you are interested, drink together under the moon, talk to each other, and lie on the grass until late at night.</p>
<p>Jiulongpo must not be as lively as it used to be, but the mountain scenery under the moon must still be the same. In this noisy city, I often recall Jiulongpo, recall the life during the years of the Anti-Japanese War, and think of the beautiful Jiulongpo, and at the same time, I also think of the entire beautiful China. Quiet Jiulongpo, although I have left in a big city thousands of miles away, I recall it, I love its tranquility, a tranquility that is not easily obtained in the world!</p>
<h3>The Abandoned Colonel</h3>
<p>— Chuan Qiu</p>
<p>Before the United Nations launched the invasion of Europe, the US military was constantly pouring into the British Isles, setting up camps everywhere. An American colonel was ordered to inspect the barracks that were under construction in various places. His driver was a member of the beautiful British Women's Auxiliary Corps Motor Transport Corps. Wherever they went, the houses were under construction, and none were completed. Every time this driver arrived, she carefully looked for women's toilets, but she was always disappointed. As she drove along, her unpleasant mood gradually increased. Finally, she could not bear it any longer. When they were returning to headquarters, she stopped the car on the side of the road, stammered "I'm sorry," got out of the car, walked hundreds of steps quickly, and hid in the woods. A few minutes later, she reappeared, looking straight at the ground, lowered her head shyly, got into the car, started the engine, and drove straight away without saying a word. When she drove fifty miles to the headquarters parking lot, she turned her head and found that the army colonel was not in the car. Three words and two sentences collection</p>
<h3>The Sound of Gongs and Drums Next Door Prevents Sleep All Night</h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu, the sales director of the Yue Dong Cigarette Factory, was threatened this month on the 17th by someone who claimed to be "reporting a traitor" and extorted twenty gold bars. He negotiated in various places such as the Royal Cafe, Da Sanyuan Tea Room, and Meihua Restaurant. Finally, it was reduced to eight. Zhu secretly reported it to the police. On the 24th, he pretended to make a payment at the Fuchunlou Restaurant and seized the four criminals. I admire Mr. Zhu's patience and perseverance. He put it off for a week before reporting it to the police station, and the case was solved immediately, reducing a lot of investigation procedures for the police.</p>
<p>More than ninety theaters requested a reduction in donations, but did not achieve their goal, and prepared to collectively suspend operations automatically from July 1st. I am quite worried about the employees of the theaters in the city. If they stop operating, will there be problems with their lives? But when I think of the sound of gongs and drums next door at night, which often prevents me from falling asleep, I feel that it is good to have a few quiet nights.</p>
<p>It is said that white japonica rice is becoming scarce in the market, and rice merchants mostly use brown rice to supply the market. This is to promote eating brown rice. It not only meets the purpose of thrift, but also improves health, and should be commended.</p>
<p>The health authorities are working hard without slacking off, but the epidemic is rampant and getting worse every day. The number of cold food stalls on the street has not decreased, and DDT seems to be not very "popular" anymore.</p>
<p>Xu Weizhen, the president of the puppet High Court, was very unhappy with the sentence of ten years in prison, and repeatedly said that he did not accept it. Xu was quite famous in the judicial circles in the past, and he was also well versed in the law. If he were a judge today, how should he judge a criminal like him who colludes with enemy countries? I am afraid that only he himself knows the answer!</p>
<p>In view of the serious housing shortage, a certain company specially commissioned a bank to design and build real three-story city houses and fake three-story garden houses for sale in Pudong. Is this really reducing the serious housing shortage? There are plenty of houses in Shanghai, but I only regret that I don't have the connections, so it is better to say that there is a "lack of alchemy" than to say that there is a serious housing shortage.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Gestures</h3>
<p>— Chuan Hong</p>
<p>Miss Mei Ou recently returned to China from the Far East, and told the following story, and swore not to lie. When he arrived in Shanghai one night, it was late, and he stayed in a hotel. The Chinese servant knocked on the door and came in, speaking his most wonderful Pidgin English, and asked, "Want a dog?" Mei Ou asked back, "What?" The servant replied, "Dog." At the same time, he made many gestures to explain what a "dog" was. Because this pantomime was so perfect, Mei Ou finally understood. But what he urgently needed was only a bathroom and a bed, so he pointed to his gray hair and old glasses, indicating that the old man did not have such interest. But his pantomime was not as good as the servant's. Half an hour later, the servant returned to the room, followed by an old woman with chicken skin and crane hair, wearing glasses on her nose.</p>
<h3>The Wealthy and Noble of the Qianlong and Jiaqing Eras</h3>
<p>— Cao Zuohan</p>
<p>In the recent domestic news in the newspapers, in addition to the issue of the war between the Kuomintang and the Communists, the issue of the treatment of public education personnel also seems to be raging. The proposal of the Legislative Yuan, based on the price index, which is only one-tenth of the pre-war ratio, has not yet been passed. The number of adjustments now decided is that the monthly salary income is still enough to buy half a dan of rice. In the past, Tao Yuanming was unwilling to bend his waist for five dou of rice, then today's officials seem to be better than in the past.</p>
<p>In fact, the poor treatment of officials has not started today. In the Outer Chronicle of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, there are a few sentences that say:</p>
<p>"Today's Chinese government is accustomed to demanding and extorting. The small salary of officials makes people gasp in surprise... Then how do officials live? They only extort bribes for a living."</p>
<p>Just how small was the salary at that time that it could make people gasp in surprise? Its smallness can be known. But there are still people running around to seek it, because being an official is another way to make money. I remember that before the Anti-Japanese War, a certain Mr. Wang from Tianjin came to govern my county. From the moment he got off the car, all his subordinates, from the secretary section chief to the doorman and tea servant, were replaced. The people of the county who were good at visiting privately nicknamed him "Wang Yituan," because the number of people he brought was enough to form a regiment. Why did he do this? It is said that those who came here were all "carrying strong men," and their nature was the same as running a business in partnership. Since they received a good deal, all the shareholders, big and small, had to share a cup of it. In the 1861 article "The Corruption of the Chinese Government" in "China's Friend," it is stated:</p>
<p>"The government says: Come! Zhang San Li Si, pass the imperial examination, offer your money, and I will give you an official title. The scholars and imperial scholars, once they become officials, will exploit and accumulate wealth; when they have a lot of money, they will seek promotion; when they are promoted, they will exploit again. Officials, regardless of their size, all use this as a way to live. Below the governor-general is the governor, whose salary is about fifty pounds, and whose annual income is about four thousand three hundred and thirty-two pounds. The governors and governors all have the power of life and death..."</p>
<p>This is really a good deal, but unfortunately, how much of the people's hard-earned money was wasted and squandered because of this! No wonder there is a folk song of "three years of Qingzhi Prefecture, one hundred thousand taels of silver"; as a result, what is manifested in the private lives of corrupt officials is obscenity and shamelessness, and extravagant and excessive enjoyment. There is a passage in the General History of the Qing Dynasty that writes truthfully:</p>
<p>"At that time, food, clothing, vehicles, and playthings were all competing for novelty and ingenuity, and their extravagance was beyond what emperors could achieve... When a certain river governor entertained guests, a basket of pork had to kill more than fifty pigs, taking only a piece of the back meat, and the rest was discarded. To eat camel hump, three or four camels were needed for one table, and goose paws and monkey brains were also taken from the essence. Even a plate of tofu had dozens of ways to make it... Because the food was so complicated, a banquet often lasted for three days and nights."</p>
<p>If the governance of officials is not clarified, the country will be poor and the people weak, the national treasury will be empty, and the people will be unable to live. Only corrupt officials and treacherous merchants are the winners who get what they want. When Heshen's crimes were revealed and his property was confiscated, his own property exceeded the total income of the national treasury for ten years. How much did the country and the people have to be exploited and squeezed by him?</p>
<p>The above situation is from the time of Qianlong and Jiaqing. The reason for the Hong Yang Rebellion has ethnic and other factors, but the issue of people's livelihood caused by corruption is also a major cause.</p>
<p>Of course, this time is different from Qianlong and Jiaqing, but the number of bandits is still greater than at the end of the Ming Dynasty. It is hoped that we will not be driven into the jungle to be beaten, or driven into the deep to be fished. Clarifying the governance of officials and improving treatment are both urgent and cannot be delayed.</p>

<h3>The Experiential School of Acting</h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>We can see the acting methods of this school in the style of Stanislavski's "Moscow Art Theatre." This theater centers on performance, viewing actors as the fundamental and primary medium of theatrical art. The theater is owned, enjoyed, and governed by actors, but its main belief is not focused on individual creative expression, but rather on collective expression as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Stanislavski founded this theater with the aim of using "truth" to transcend the artificial "external" performances that were gradually growing in the theater at the time. He said that exaggerated styles and artificially designed expressions of emotion were gorgeous and pretentious. In his theater, each actor must put themselves in the position of the protagonist, empathically imitate the character, and experience inner emotions individually. The director merely helps them to inspire. Therefore, they call their theater a "theater of inner emotional drama." The foundation of this theater's style is to achieve beauty through simplicity and refinement, placing realistic scenery around the actors, and imitating the character's emotions truthfully and accurately. His ideal, he said, was to "drive fake theater out of the theater."</p>
<p>For this reason, the performances at the Moscow Art Theatre are more diligent than those at other theaters. They prefer to be serious and do not like to spend effort on bright decorations and pleasing costumes. They established an inner theory of performance, in which actors experience the character when performing, abandon their own will, and live the life of the character they play. Everything is done naturally, not only expressing the external appearance of the character's life, but more importantly, creating the inner life of the character being performed on stage, what Stanislavski called "emotional intuition," to contain an inner, extremely profound meaning in the external form. The inner life of this character is created through the actor's inner experience process, living the individual's feelings into the character's life, injecting the soul into the characteristic parts of the character, becoming a symbol of personal life, and selecting naturalistic details that can emphasize and digest various psychological opportunities, giving psychological elements to everything. For this reason, actors need more acute senses and more experience than in real life. And every time an actor performs, they must experience it once.</p>
<p>When an actor is completely gripped by the script they are acting in, most of the work is subconscious, relying on the natural power of the human organism. If the organism is stupid, a method must be used to stimulate it and drive it. This is the method of technical psychology, which enables actors to awaken creative awareness within themselves. For the entire psychological preparation for creation, actors must develop stage control and creative concentration within themselves, a solitary mental state completely isolated from ordinary interests, and any mental preparation is indispensable before starting creation. This is produced by the actor's long-term cultivation and enthusiastic psychological training. The task of this method is to use consciousness to indirectly awaken the subconscious to create, that is, to reveal the realism of the actor's inner life along all the natural rules of the human organism to stimulate the subconscious, so as to burst forth inspiration. Therefore, conscious and correct creation is the best foundation for the subconscious and inspiration to create. Stanislavski said in "My Art Life": "This does not mean that I want to create inspiration by artificial methods, which is impossible. What I require is: how to create a good quality that can express inspiration through will. If that quality exists, inspiration will easily pass through the actor's soul."</p>
<p>"Conscious technical psychology" is to develop this ability of creative awareness and to explain the inner essence of creation. Correct creative awareness results from a correct stage belief in the created material that has a sense of reality. Just like the purity of a child, Stanislavski said that "correct artistic truth" can eliminate artificiality in performance and produce the miracle of image life." Creation is guided from the actor's imagination and fantasy. When this assumed imagination appears, the actor can produce a greater fascination than real life and believe in it from the bottom of their heart. This will produce real stage actions. If the "consistent direction" and "core of the character" of the script are discovered, then the stage image will emerge accordingly. What should be noted here is that they are all proceeding towards a fundamental and supreme goal, and the character is a decomposition of this topic. The actor must connect the actions and converge towards this supreme goal, expressing the author's latent meaning and thoughts. They are like this, focusing on studying people's inner experiences and emotions.</p>
<p>Only this kind of performing art can completely grip the audience, so that the audience not only understands but also experiences everything that happens on the stage, enriching the audience's inner experience and leaving a trace that cannot be erased by time.</p>

<h3>Fourth General Review of Shanghai Drama</h3>
<p>— Guan Yu</p>
<p>Ten. "Teacher for All Generations"</p>
<p>"Teacher for All Generations" was the first performance of the China Electric Troupe after arriving in Shanghai. They truly introduced the level of drama in the Great Rear Area to the audience in Shanghai. Before this performance, many troop troupes used the banner of inland drama actors to give multiple public performances in Shanghai, which caused the audience to doubt the acting level of inland drama actors and made them even more disappointed with inland directors. Only after the performance of "Teacher for All Generations" by the China Electric Troupe did they truly recognize the highest level of inland drama actors. In particular, they were very satisfied with the director's handling.</p>
<p>Although the playwright and director of "Teacher for All Generations" have two different names, we know that they were originally one and two, two and one, a playwright. When he directed the play, his attitude was very serious, and he also had the power to control the acting line and level of the actors. Therefore, the plays he directed were quite complete and tidy. This has been generally recognized by all sectors during the performance.</p>
<p>"Teacher for All Generations" describes how a university professor arduously holds on to his post, teaches a group of young refugee students, and leads this group of students to walk to Yunnan to relocate the school. For a full twenty-five years, he never left his post. When he was so poor that he could no longer live, someone advised him to first lay a little economic foundation, but he did not do so. He just held on to his post diligently. He dedicated his life to this great cause, not caring about the rewards of the present and the future, but only feeling that "it is a pleasure to share one's knowledge with others" was enough.</p>
<p>In this performance, we cannot find a trace of the star system, nor any performance of a genius actor making personal development! In this play, we truly saw the collective creation of the actors. Therefore, we were able to appreciate a serious and complete work of art.</p>
<p>In another play he wrote and directed, "Mountain City Story," we cannot see such a complete collective creation. We know that the pioneers of drama have told us to put every actor on the stage in the position of the protagonist to imitate real people, and to use the success of the entire performance to replace the star system of one or two genius actors.</p>
<p>Therefore, the success of a play's performance is not the success of a certain actor, but the success of every actor, that is, the success of the whole.</p>
<p>The success of "Teacher for All Generations" is not the success of a certain actor, but the success of all the workers.</p>
<p>Eleven. "Chongqing Twenty-Four Hours"</p>
<p>This is also a play performed by the China Electric Troupe. In this play, we cannot find any of the excellent traces in the performance of "Teacher for All Generations." All that is the same is the name of the performing troupe. Other than that, there is no more breath of China Electric's performance.</p>
<p>The phenomenon shown in this play is exactly the star system we want to overthrow. It is undeniable that here we can fully see the deformed development of genius actors. They can disregard the character's personality and real life and use formal techniques to perform their roles. At the same time, their attitude towards art does not seem serious, because some things cause them to laugh in memory, so the stage and the audience are integrated, and everyone laughs. This, at least in this kind of performance, is problematic. However, it cannot be completely denied that they are more serious in other performances, but they have not faithfully implemented the observation and imitation of the character's personality.</p>
<p>The playwright added a lot of interesting gimmicks in "Chongqing Twenty-Four Hours," which are only familiar to the people of Chongqing; for example, the electric lights dimming until they go out, and then slowly turning red and white and lighting up. There is no one in Chongqing who has not personally experienced these things. It is just as common as the people of Shanghai queuing up early to wait for the National Rolling Household Rice and being starved by the enemy's blockade. Because the playwright wrote it this way, it has a bit of local color, and with local color, it is also limited by locality.</p>
<p>However, this play is written very compactly. The playwright unified the time, place, and action, so that the things to be done are completed in the same place within twenty-four hours. This is what we call the "three unities."</p>
<p>I have seen the performance of this play in different places five or six times, but their business performance always does not exceed the height of Chongqing.</p>

<p>— Wen Quan</p>
<p>(6) Color Harmony</p>
<p>Color harmony is entirely a matter of feeling caused by color contrast. Some colors feel harmonious to the human eye, while some combinations feel dazzling and uncomfortable. Common harmonious colors include: yellow and blue, red and blue, red and gray, blue and orange, blue and black, black and white, orange and green, black and yellow, white and purple, cyan and red, yellow and red, purple and orange, orange and brown, white and blue, red and white, brown and white, etc. In the combination, it is also necessary to pay attention to adding white or diluting with water to make bright tones (Tint), adding black to make dark tones (Shade), and adding both white and black to make broken tones (Broken Tone). This can make the scope of color harmony wider and obtain the pleasant beauty of life under various qualities, education, customs, and human relationships.</p>
<p>Xiang Fulu Ershang divides color harmony into two major categories. The first category is similar harmony (Harmonies of analogy), which is further divided into three types: the harmony of color steps, which is the matching of various luminances arranged in the order of equal difference of the color value (Value) of the same color step (that is, a color of the same color); the harmony of mixed colors, which is the matching of the same or similar luminances on the color steps of adjacent colors (such as yellow and orange, cyan and green); and the harmony of dominant color light, which is the matching of various different colors in which one color is uniquely visible and noticeably subordinates the remaining colors. (This kind of harmony is the same as observing objects with dichroic glass, and all object colors change color and have a common tendency.) The second category is contrast harmony (Harmonies of constract), which is also divided into three types: the harmony of color step contrast, which is the matching of suspended luminances in the same color step; the harmony of mixed color contrast, which is the matching of suspended luminances in the color steps of adjacent colors; and the harmony of different color contrast, which is the matching of very different color steps. It is generally the same as the summary of each family of Lousijing Feilai (Baily). It is nothing more than seeking unity from change.</p>
<p>The most important thing to pay attention to in the first type of harmony method is "color phase transition" (Gredation of Colour). The colors in nature, such as grass, trees, insects, and even the colors of the sky, are the most common phenomena; that is, the lightness and depth of the same color or similar colors are gradually or intermittently changed, and the contrast is clear (more distant luminances or small blanks can be used to separate the transitions of various luminances). The taste of harmony is the most elegant and peaceful. In other words, different lightness and darkness and saturation of the same color phase can achieve harmony under any proportion.</p>
<p>The second type of harmony method is mainly to unify the whole with the dominant color light, and its dominant color occupies the dominant position in terms of area or intensity. The colors dominated by it are suitable for those with a distance of 90 degrees to 220 degrees in the color wheel, because they implicitly contain the same pigment. The points to pay attention to when applying it are further listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The color area and lightness should be inversely proportional, and pay attention to the overall breadth to determine the color area, so as to achieve its balance.</p>
<p>(2) The combination of two colors is beautiful with approximate complementary colors, but the lightness should be different, that is, add gray to each or darken their tones to form an unsaturated state. If the combination of the other two colors is not suitable, it can also be harmonized if unsaturated colors are used instead.</p>
<p>(3) When matching three colors, it is advisable to use two warm colors and one cold color. Decorations and paintings in ancient times all had warm color tones.</p>
<p>(4) The area of cold colors should not be too wide. If it is necessary to use a large amount of it, the color should be light, but green should still be used sparingly. (There is no pure green in ancient Greek wall decorations).</p>
<p>(5) When using black and white and other colors, pay attention to the change in contrast on the lightness.</p>
<p>(6) Gold and silver colors can only be used as connecting lines, and their lightness and darkness should be opposite to the background color.</p>
<p>(7) For complex color schemes, you can follow the proportions of beautiful natural colors such as butterflies, flowers, and gemstones. It is also advisable to use more broken color silk. It is best to have one or five colors that are prominent, so that the whole has a tendency to the same mixed color. (Sometimes adding small dots or thin lines of one color to the whole has the same effect.)</p>
<p>(8) Use less bright and simple colors to make people obtain a wider position. (The most bright colors in nature are flowers, but their area is particularly small, and the surrounding colors are mostly dark; there are also bright and fixed comparisons, so that their colors are not too dazzling, so they do not harm the sense of beauty.)</p>
<p>(9) The number of colors used should not be too many (regardless of the lightness of each color).</p>
<p>In addition to the harmony of volume and area mentioned above, there are also differences in the length and order of time of perception and physical phenomena. We all know that all dark colors are heavier than light colors. For example, the black pants and white shirts of Chinese women and the black pants and white clothes of Western European choirs can make people feel comfortable in terms of feeling. This is because the heavy color is below and the light color is above. If this physics is reversed, it will definitely give people a feeling of disharmony. The length and order of time of perception are related to the residual sense phenomenon. Special attention should be paid to this in color films.</p>
<h3>Two Comedies</h3>
<p>— Tao Xiong</p>
<p>Although "A Chart of Official Promotions" and "A New Official Takes Office" are different in performance, their themes are the same. The former describes how a group of corrupt officials use power to exploit the common people, how to flatter their superiors, and even sacrifice their sisters and wives, in exchange for the only goal - to be promoted and make a fortune; among colleagues, they establish a wide network, exclude and squeeze each other! These are just the present forms of bureaucrats on the political stage! The latter describes a group of traitors, but aren't they also exploiting the common people, flattering their superiors, and excluding each other? However, in the environment and status of this group of people, they are not as noble and legitimate as in "A Chart of Official Promotions." Although the county magistrate and secretary in "A Chart of Official Promotions" are two habitual thieves, aren't all the others imposing officials? And in "A New Official Takes Office," it is a group of ignorant hooligans. Although this group of hooligans is pretending to be like real officials, they are ultimately pitiful! Because they don't know how to be officials, their "ancestors" have never been officials, so even on a notice, they have to write the names, ages, hometowns, and where they live of these officials. When they have a little something to do, they can hold meetings at will, "standing at attention" looking very much like it. Once the chicken comes, they can disperse in a rush for a braised or stewed chicken! They don't care what the results of the meeting are. Their stupid behavior makes people feel pitiful and laughable, and they are much more innocent than the officials in "A Chart of Official Promotions."</p>
<p>The method of corruption of the officials in "A New Official Takes Office" is to sell white powder and opium, and this one asks that one for monthly rule money; that one tells this one that he has no money, you have money, everyone should enjoy the blessing! And the method of corruption of the officials in "A Chart of Official Promotions" is to levy donations from the common people; to ask subordinates for gold bars to cure headaches, and to ask subordinates to sell a five-carat diamond ring for a few dollars. From these perspectives, stupid hooligans are much more straightforward than shameless bureaucrats.</p>
<p>These two plays were written by Chen Baichen. Their themes are all about the various forms in the officialdom, and they are all comedies. Because the times and social environments in which the playwright wrote were different, these two different works were written under the same theme. From this point, we can know that an author cannot be separated from the times and society!</p>
<h3>Luo Zhenzhi Advocates Kun Opera</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhenzhi</p>
<p>Shanghai is an area where humanities gather. Most kinds of local operas are available, but only the Kun Opera of our Suzhou territory is entrusted to Min Ru. Why? For twenty years, wars have filled our eyes, and people's hearts are strong. What we have seen and heard has all tended to be violent. Therefore, the style of opera has gradually become stimulating, and the sounds of music, poetry, and odes are not valued by the world. In addition, culture has declined, etiquette and righteousness are almost lost, the market is noisy, and the autumn is mourned by insects, causing the southern immortals to become scattered; in the north, only Han Bai remains, and Han Shichang does not want to come out to perform, but specializes in teaching music for a living. Kun performers have also sighed that they were born at the wrong time! If Mei Lanfang successfully takes the stage, he will use Kun Opera as the vanguard, with the intention of reviving the decline. The highbrow art is half to promote national studies and half to cultivate people's hearts; the words of the songs are beautiful and deeply moving, so they should be a noble form of entertainment, how can we let them be buried and unknown!</p>
<p>The legendary scripts were all written by well-known people in the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, and often take several studies to be published. Their meaning does not escape loyalty, filial piety, and righteousness, containing the essence of education. If Dou E contains grievances, flying snow in June, reading at night with straw sandals, and being granted a double crown, although they are deliberately depicted, we must know that they are eager to persuade people to do good, and they have many good influences, which are helpful to the world. Today, science is prosperous, and people can definitely overcome nature, but there are many social events, and frauds, deceptions, and thefts emerge one after another. If we can use the style of opera to correct people's hearts, it may not be a good proverb for preaching! However, at the beginning of its creation and performance, it relies on the theater owner to mediate well and guide enthusiastically!</p>
<p>The great corners of Beijing Opera, Mei, Cheng, Xun, and Shang, all have a foundation in Kun Opera. From this, we can know that Beijing Opera and Kun Opera cannot be regarded as two different paths, causing the separation of Qin and Yue. I wish that Beijing Opera and Kun Opera would be integrated, or in the performance of Beijing Opera, interspersed with Kun Opera programs, so that Kun Opera would not disappear from people's ears and eyes, and be forgotten. I hope that those who love Kun Opera will work hard to promote it, and I am willing to wait and see the revival of Kun Opera!</p>

<h3>The Plot Playwright Scribe</h3>
<p>— Da Chun</p>
<p>Before the 19th century, European plays were mostly poetic dramas. In the early 19th century, although Victor Hugo raised the banner of literary revolution in France, advocating Romanticism, his work "Hernani," which served as the prelude to Romantic literature, was also a poetic drama. It was not until Augustin Eugene Scribe arose that he began to promote vernacular drama, which was extremely popular in society at the time, and no one dared to challenge him. Another reason was that Scribe's comedies of manners, with their intricate structures and abundant interest, perfectly met the demands of the middle class at the time. His improved vernacular dramas were eagerly sought after by theaters such as the Theatre de S. A. R. Madame, the Theatre de la Comedie Francaise, and the Opera-Comique, and even influenced the rest of Europe. The theaters of various countries were almost dominated by Scribe's works.</p>
<p>Scribe was the son of a merchant, born in Paris on December 24, 1791, and died on February 20, 1861. During his lifetime, he wrote more than four hundred plays, either alone or in collaboration with others, at least three hundred and fifty of which were published separately or included in various collections. Scribe was a talented writer. In 1815, his popular comedy "Une nuit de la garde nationale" and several lively short plays, such as "Ie sollicitur" and "L'ours et Pacha," were published and immediately welcomed by the literary world, making him a famous writer. From 1811 to 1862, his plays were performed in various theaters for more than fifty years, and no French playwright was as highly regarded for so long. In terms of style, he applied comedy, vaudeville, popular vaudeville, melodrama, opera, and opera-comique styles. Scribe's earliest works were one-act popular comedies, and he later wrote five-act comedies. Scribe was an astute and meticulous observer, capturing the customs and habits of society at the time. His plays focus on construction, taking plot (Device) as a premise, rather than emphasizing wording and interest as problem plays do. Scribe had a magical and unpredictable technique, and the structure of his plays was original, very clever, and intricate. The beginning is often unremarkable, but the ending can be amazing. Every prop and book in his plays is a clue to the whole play, which can arouse the audience's interest. The plot is captivating everywhere, like a detective novel, and the ups and downs are also heart-stopping. Moreover, he can cater to the psychology of the masses, and the plays have a common character, with simple and readable words, just like Bai Juyi's poems, which even old women can understand. Therefore, the critics of the time called his plays "Pieces bien faits" (well-made plays). Later Eugène Labiche and Henri Bernstein (1876–1953) were his disciples.</p>
<p>From the opening of the Gymnase Theatre in Paris in 1820 to 1830, Scribe wrote many popular comedies for the theater, expressing them with very appropriate themes and rich content. The best works of this period are "Le plus beau jour de la vie," "La Demoisrllea marier," and "Le charlatanisme." The main themes of Scribe's plays are not hidden: they provide exactly the happiness and ideals that the middle class needs.</p>
<p>Scribe adapted several themes from popular comedies into comedies and achieved considerable success. His "Valerie" was performed at the Comedie Francaise in 1822, and in 1827 the theater staged his "Le camaraderie." From 1833 to 1850, his works often won the audience's praise at the theater. During this period, the theater successively performed his "Bertrand et Raton" (1833), "Le camaraderie," "La calomnie" (1840), "Le verre dieau" (1840), and "Une chaine" (1841).</p>
<p>From 1815 to 1848, comedies accounted for the largest proportion of French plays, and plays about money issues occupied a very large position in theaters: almost all erotic comedies were infected with this issue. In addition to Scribe's "Le camaraderie" and "Le Puff" (1848), more famous ones include "L'argent" (1825) by C. Binjour (1795-1856), and "L'agiotage" (1826) co-authored by L.B. Picard (1769-1828) and A.S. Empis (1795-1868). After 1848, F. Pinsaraent (1853) and "La Boursr" (1856) appeared.</p>
<p>From 1823, Scribe also wrote many operas and opera-comiques: "La Dame blanche", "La Muette de Portici" (1828), officers, baronesses, innocent girls, national guards, veterans of the Empire era, clever officials, fake news reporters, explosive merchants, notaries, small clerks, etc., are all model images, he simply exhibited an accurate and moving large picture album in front of people. The clothes, actions, anecdotes, and conversations of these characters revolved around. Looking at the characters in those comedies of manners, people are reminded of the works of Moliere, J.-F. Regard (1655-1709), F. Dancourt (1661-1725) and Pierre-Claude Nivelle de La Chaussée, and others. And sometimes Scribe performed even better than them.</p>
<p>Scribe had many collaborating friends who only helped him find some materials and provide some opinions. One collaborator named Carmouche once said, "I have collaborated with Scribe on twelve or fifteen popular comedies, but I always tell you that not a single word in these works is mine." Scribe often selected a few scenes from the collaborators' works, changed the theme, compacted the various parts, and rewrote them from beginning to end. The collaborators also got less than half of the benefits.</p>
<p>The best plays written by Scribe in his lifetime are "Bertrand et Raton," "Le verre d'eau," "Bataille de dames" (1851), "Le camaraderie," and "Le camaraderie". "Bertrand et Raton" and "Le verre d'eau" are model works in historical comedies, and the strokes are light and refined, pure. Alexandre Dumas also often praised him. "Bertrand et Raton" writes about the struggle between the Count of Lanjos and Stroganov. "Le verre d'eau" writes about the struggle between the Duchess of Marlborough and Bolingbroke. Scribe often chose adventurous or dangerous themes. "Bataille de dames" depicts the competition between two women to rescue a conspiratorial teenager whom they love. Will he be caught? There is endless interest in this hidden event, in this search, and in this strict language. The protagonist in "Le camaraderie" is a typical figure of the new moral nouveau riche. A young man is in love with a widow's money and marries her without love. The characters in "Le camaraderie" are similar to the typical characters in "Cabotins" by B. Pailleron (1834-1899), but Scribe's lines are clearer.</p>
<p>In addition to dramas, Scribe also wrote many short stories and published them in various newspapers and periodicals. His complete works were not published until 1859.</p>
<p>Scribe only cared about writing in his life and had no other extravagant expectations. His collaborator J.-F. Bayard once said, "He is a truly outstanding writer, just like a few writers, he is content with such a title, and does not want to use the writer's guise to seek other things. His name is not in any faction, he does not want to engage in any revolution, he does not summon any powerful people, although there are people among them whom he admires. He does not bow down to honor, status, or subsidies. He only asks for himself, only exhausts his talent and work, he has his happiness and independence..."</p>
<p>On January 28, 1836, Scribe entered the Académie Française.</p>
<p>O, Feillet (1821-1890) once said: "In the field of literary creation, the most difficult technique is to induce imagination without abandoning imagination, to touch the heart without disturbing the heart, to comfort people rather than bribing people; this supreme technique is what Scribe has."</p>
<p>On March 26, 1863, at the meeting place of the Académie Française, Vitet (1802-1873) also said: "Scribe has a strong and excellent talent, which guarantees his deserved position. In this era, he holds the reins of the drama world. He has an inventive talent for plays, which can be said to be unprecedented... His imagination is not thrown into an ordinary mill, he has his secrets, he has his methods, and he never expresses himself in the same way..."</p>
<p>Since writing plays, the most difficult thing to deal with is the structure, and Scribe's plays have overcome this difficulty. Today, although Scribe's works are no longer popular, his ingenious structure still has lasting value. This is what playwrights should learn from him. The purpose of my writing this article is only this point.</p>
<h3>Mold (Novel) (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>Of course, he never received money from his wife. He understood that it was a kind of shame, and he felt angry. But the result of his anger was just letting out a long breath and that was it.</p>
<p>It's embarrassing to say, but sometimes he actually felt a little regret. For example: when he attended meetings and saw the youngsters like Yang Ke-ren and Zhou Da-xiong, all wearing smart suits, offering cigarettes and chatting up the pot-bellied school board members, he secretly regretted not accepting his wife's money. Otherwise, those pot-bellied guys would at least look at him differently, or ask his name, instead of letting those youngsters monopolize the spotlight.</p>
<p>That kind of regret was naturally hidden deep in his heart. He never dared to reveal it to anyone, not even to himself. However, he certainly knew it existed, except when some naughty students chased after him shouting "cuckold."</p>
<p>Now, in the dim light of the rapeseed oil lamp, looking at his wife, he thought of all these things, past and present. But tonight, everything seemed a little different. There was only one thing in his heart - rage! There was only one thing in front of his eyes - Yang Ke-ren's smug face filled with coldness.</p>
<p>"How hateful, woman! Tonight, you even pretend to offer me some comfort with your fake kindness. Who wants your comfort? Because of your shamelessness, my rice bowl is shaky, do you know that?"</p>
<p>He shouted angrily in his heart. His fist almost slammed into his wife's tender face. He felt that he was too easy on her when she came back just now by only giving her a sneer and ignoring her. He really should do as Yang Ke-ren said: "That kind of woman, give her a good beating!"</p>
<p>The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, the more anxious he felt. Finally, he lost control and croaked out from his throat: "Give her a beating!"</p>
<p>He didn't shout loudly. But in the silent night, it was startling enough. His wife suddenly opened her eyes, looked at him, and asked in surprise: "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>He glared at his wife. Awakened from her sleep, her cheeks were flushed, making her look particularly beautiful. This charm pricked his eyes, pricked his heart. He hated her. At this moment, he clearly felt that he hated her. He slowly raised his clenched fist.</p>
<p>However, before his fist landed, his wife had already jumped out of bed.</p>
<p>"Don't hit me, let's talk it over properly…" She grabbed his hand, her flushed face pressed against his shoulder, and she stammered in fright: "When I came back just now, I could tell that you weren't very happy tonight, so I didn't dare tell you something very happy...". She cried, and tears dripped onto his clothes. She was a woman of rich experience, understanding that tears could melt a man's heart, especially a man like Feng Zeng-shou.</p>
<p>Sure enough, his fist loosened. Like a child wronged, complaining to his mother, he told his wife about the anger in his heart.</p>
<p>"So that's it! You've been tricked, let me tell you!..." After listening to his story, his wife smiled slightly and told him succinctly: "Recently, a girlfriend introduced me to a rich old man, a big shot, and also the most powerful director in your school. A few days ago, I asked him to promote you. He agreed immediately. Yesterday he told me that he had talked to your principal and that the position of Dean of Studies for next semester will definitely be offered to you. Yang Ke-ren probably found out about this news, so he came up with a plan today to scare you, instigate you, and make sure you don't succeed..."</p>
<p>"Understand?"</p>
<p>She didn't say much more, just gently asked: "Understand?" He nodded. She leaned close to his ear and whispered: "I did it all for you!" He nodded again. And so, the storm passed.</p>
<p>It passed. As the night deepened, in the dim light, he saw two old men with smirking faces, hugging his wife's petite body, turning, jumping, and laughing in front of him. Gradually, many familiar faces appeared in front of him, Yang Ke-ren, Zhou Da-xiong, Zhang Kang-yuan, Wang Fa-kui... Ah! Those hateful youngsters were all spitting on him and shouting at him: "Turtle! Turtle!"</p>
<p>As if in a fit of rage, his body moved slightly. But in an instant, the old man and his wife disappeared, and he was standing proudly in front of those youngsters. No! He seemed to be sitting leisurely in the Dean's office, wearing a snow-white silk shirt and light gray suit, talking secretly with Principal Li, the big boss, about joining forces to go to Nanjing and Shanghai to make money. A thin teacher knocked on the door and came in, wearing a torn blue cloth gown, with his head bowed. He looked and saw, oh, it was Yang Ke-ren, "Humph!"…</p>
<p>Humph…</p>
<p>He laughed! Opening his eyes, the rapeseed oil lamp was flickering, and his heart was also flickering.</p>
<p>It was still a moldy day, and the hot wind from the supermarket was blowing everywhere. The Dean of Studies for next semester would be changed.</p>
<p>Feng Zeng-shou had a talk with Principal Li, and dozens of strange eyes were looking at his face at the same time. He strode through these strange eyes, proudly carrying his books towards the teachers' room.</p>
<p>He walked very fast, his thin body floating, almost able to fly into the sky. But suddenly, he stopped, and his "proudly" disappeared. He heard a group of students laughing in the sixth-grade classroom, and in the middle was a very clear voice:</p>
<p>"Ha... Mr. Feng's wife sleeps with my dad, five thousand yuan a night... Ha..."</p>
<p>He could tell that it was Zhang Kang-yuan's voice. He gritted his teeth and clenched his fists, wanting to rush into the classroom. But suddenly, his fist touched a thick wad of something in his pocket, and his hand loosened. He remembered what his wife said when she stuffed this wad of things into his pocket in the morning: "Old Man Zhang said that when your school directors hold a meeting next week, he will introduce you to a few bigwigs, but how can you meet people looking like that? Hurry up and order a suit today first!" Thinking of this, he suddenly felt a burning sensation on his face; in an instant, his whole body began to burn.</p>
<p>Finally, he wiped away the sweat and carefully pressed down on the thick wad of things in his pocket, and stepped past the sixth-grade classroom, burning all over.</p>
<p>Muggy, humid, hot... A dim sun hung in the sky… (The End)</p>

<h3>Flying Together (6)(9)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>The situation on the second and third days was similar. Li-hua's performance continued to be praised, while Li-yun's was mediocre, not good, but not a complete failure. Therefore, after three days, the two sisters officially went to sea (started performing). They signed a half-year contract with the troupe manager. Their names were temporarily ranked second or third, and then considered for promotion. Li-yun's salary was 20 yuan per month, and Li-hua's salary was 40 yuan per month. Although Li-hua's income was not much, it could be considered that Mrs. Mo's purpose had been achieved. They were finally earning money while living at home. However, 12 yuan out of the 60 yuan had to be given to Zhang Xian (this was a condition that Zhang Xian had set in advance. After the apprentice started earning, the master had to extract 20% of the apprentice's salary). Moreover, Mrs. Mo still asked them to continue learning opera, because she hoped that they would have greater success. Mrs. Mo had promised Zhang Xian before the new year to increase the tuition fee to 40 yuan per month this year. In this way, the money they earned was all spent on Zhang Xian. Fortunately, Zhang Xian waived the fee for pulling the huqin (Chinese violin) for them to show his generosity. But he stated that this was only a temporary help during the transitional period. When they became more familiar with the stage and had a little more experience, others could also pull the huqin for them. Then he would no longer help them. If they had to have him pull the huqin, they would have to pay him separately. After Mrs. Mo calculated this in her heart, she was still very optimistic. For her daughter's art, she would not hesitate to spend another sum of money to hire Zhang Xian as Li-hua's fixed huqin player. Because she always felt that to make a lot of money, you had to be willing to pay. She was optimistic about Li-hua's unlimited future, and the money she spent would definitely not be in vain. As for Li-yun, it was a favor she did along the way, and cultivating Li-yun for Second Mrs. Weng would still be beneficial to her in the future. Mrs. Mo was indeed a smart person. She saw everything far ahead, had vision and a broad mind, and dared to act, dared to be ruthless, and dared to be vicious!</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo's prediction was indeed correct! Li-hua's artistic reputation grew bigger and bigger every day. The audience liked her because she was young and talented, and gradually some audience members even began to give her gifts. Some people went to the backstage specifically to see her, and many ladies and young ladies took her to their mansions to play because they loved her. All of this made Mrs. Mo ecstatic, and made Zhang Xian and Second Mrs. Weng, Shi Yu-lou, and others jealous.</p>
<p>Yet only Li-hua didn't care! She numbly accepted everything, and she indifferently regarded everything as fleeting clouds. Her repertoire has also changed recently. In addition to the few operas that she starred in independently, the operas starring Shi Yu-lou were often added, and they seemed even more exciting, and would win more applause. As a result, this situation caused Shi Yu-lou to feel uneasy, but Shi Yu-lou did not resent Li-hua, and only mourned his own golden age!</p>
<p>Time does not forgive anyone, and Shi Yu-lou was gradually abandoned in the flight of this merciless time! His body and mind were gradually abandoned with his life, and he became gray, depressed, and even died!</p>
<p>At the same time, Li-hua grew and progressed in the flying years!</p>
<p>Second Mrs. Weng was sad because of Shi Yu-lou, and Mrs. Mo was happy because of Li-hua!</p>
