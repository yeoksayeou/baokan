<h3 id="c32">借欵購買美麥問題·梓 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>昨報載華盛頓電訊。財政部長宋子文向美國財政善後銀公司借美金五千萬元。已簽成協定。依協定。該欵以五分之四在美購買棉。五分之一則購美麥及麵粉。南京電訊。述財政部對此事所發表之說明。有「此舉對於美國及中國人民彼此有益。」及「即就政府對於內地巿場。可以賒貸棉花小麥救濟棉荒麥荒。亦能裨益不少」等語。五千萬元美金。約合國幣二萬萬元。如此巨數外債。增加國民負担。不可謂不大。而財政部之說明。竟以輕描淡寫出之。意者舉借外債。關係財政根本大計。應由最高行政機關負其責。該部之說明。爲一種不負責任之臨機應付乎。吾人在最高行政機關未正式以此事內容昭示國人以前。不能對於此大借欵事件之本身。獲得正式討論之根據。所得言者。僅此以巨額外債購買美棉美麥之事耳。關於購棉部分。容另覓統計資料。詳爲論述。今就購美麥部分言之。</p>
<p>綜核外電及財政部之說明。借欵之五分之一。即美金一千萬元。約合國幣四千萬元。應爲購買美麥及麵粉之用。此其欵額。與民國二十年秋間貸購美麥之欵。相差無幾。所可購得之麥及麵粉。當亦與上次所貸購之四十五萬噸。相去有限。查上次所貸購之美麥。據國府救濟水災委員會報告。欲運赴皖北及湘鄂各處。即感交通艱阻。運輸困難。不得不將其一部份。在口岸變賣。將所得價欵。在內地購糧。今者各口岸及沿江交通便利之地。均以去歲豐收之故。不特不。需要此外來糧食。且以去秋以來。受外糧跌價傾銷之影響。成榖賤傷農之象。深懼此大批外糧之來。相去兩年。需求與利害。已根本相反。蓋往者長江流域爲水災待賑之地。今則轉以餘糧不易求售爲苦也。</p>
<p>今日國內待賑之區。厥爲陜西。依據調查。陜西今有饑民三百三十餘萬人。以四十餘萬噸之美麥及麵粉賑之。似不嫌多。然就運輸言。上次皖北湘鄂。已感不便。今欲運至交通素稱艱阻之陜西。其爲更困難而不得不仍將粉麥在口岸變賣。得價充振欵。可無待言。而口岸農民。已早受外糧傾銷之害。於豐收凶年之後。更何以堪此乎。且上次救濟水災委員會。以變價所得。購糧內地。已有「供不應求。價格見漲。易糧因難」之經騐。今稱爲內地之近陜區域。糧食存儲。較兩年前所多無幾。此項困難。依然存在。經此兩度周折。實惠之及於陜民。能有幾何。此亦一疑問也。</p>
<p>吾人非不贊成政府之籌得巨欵。以賑災黎。惟事實上之問題。不得不加以考慮。此次借欵。倘其一部分爲現金。以之購買豐收區域之餘糧。更以政治之力。疏通運道使得達於待賑之區。則實爲兩利之道誠如昨報外電所述。則所消納者爲美國之餘麥。中國借此巨欵。利未得而害先見。此當局所應知也。雖然。此次借欵之動機。果如吾人之所推想乎。抑當局別有用意乎則吾人又未敢斷言也。</p>

<p>謂不影響我國農產</p>
<p>華東社云、財政部長宋子文氏、在美簽定五千萬美金大借欵、其中五之四購美棉、五之一則購美麥、此事關係我經濟實業、殊爲重大、華東社記者、昨特往訪紗業與麻粉廠商方面叩詢意見、所得結果、均表贊同、茲將談話誌之如後、</p>
<p>紗業界表示據華商紗布交易所理事胡筠籍氏談、中國產棉、本可自給、惟連年因被日方收買、致原料日缺、日紗旣傾銷於市塲、華紗則因原料昂貴、紗價低賤關係、備受影響、在此靑黃不接之際、更屬恐慌、宋氏在未出國前、對於此事、當已充分考慮、而前者財實兩部在滬召集救濟紗廠會議時、亦有賖購美棉之决定、此可見美棉來華、當無若何影響惟美棉價格、現值約華幣六十餘元、華棉則不過四十六元左右、故運華而後、希望財部能以八折出售、則華商方面、自能踴躍購買、對於繳欵方法、如能分期付欵、則尤爲希、望在政府賖購此項原料、欠欵須待三年後償淸、而商人等付欵、最多二三個月、在政府則可立行鉅欵、雖售價已折八折、但較之發行公債、究屬合算、况更可增加關稅之收入乎、現紗廠方面、對此不日將召會集、蓋究歸何家購買、須於事前决定也、至美棉輸華、對本國產品、影響自亦不免、惟每月入口、最多不過五萬包、故亦無影響也、</p>
<p>麵粉業表示又據榮宗敬氏左右談、我國麥粉、邇來出品殊少、自東北失陷後、原料更屬缺乏、盡全國所產者、祗數廠商二三日之需用、故麵粉廠商爲維持業務及顧全工人生活計、不得不絡續向美澳各地、購運外麥、藉以接濟、故財宋內賖購美麥之舉、對於我國、絕對不致發生影響也、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3 id="c164">要自由又不要自由 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 庶謙</p>
<p>在「要自由」的自由談上豈凡先生却喊出了「不要自由」的呺。他的理由：「人類是根本不會有自由的」，「我們是什麼自由不會有的」，「局限於一部份的自由，有了又有什麼關係」</p>
<p>但是，人煩不見得就上咪自由也沒有罷？比如現在的日本人不是有侵略中國的自由嗎？現在資本主義的國家不是有銷毀和產品的自由嗎？現在全世界的失業者不是還有餓死的自由嗎？</p>
<p>這樣看來，絕對的自由固然是沒有的；但是，絕對的不自由那里會有呢？</p>
<p>那末，我們還是「要自由」呢？還是「不要自由」呢？</p>
<p>假如我們「要自由」罷；那末，「想怎樣便做到怎樣」。推到極頂，我想便會和豈凡先生所說的一樣，「中國是壞於太自由了」。</p>
<p>假如我們「不要自由」罷；那末，「我們全要合於規律。」推到極頂，我想荒木希特勒一班人就正在希望我們不要自由，好利用機會來統治中國。</p>
<p>那末，我們還是「要自由」呢？還是「不要自由」呢？</p>
<p>我的答案是：「要自由又不要自由」，這就是說：我們所需要的自由是兩個方面：一方面是「不自由的自由」，另一方面是「自由的不自由」。</p>
<p>在「將出現的新社會」裹，人人知道是「社員的一員」，人人情願犧牲個人的自由，去完成大衆的自由。這便是我們所需要的「不自由的自由」。</p>
<p>在「將出現的新社會裹」，那種個人的不自由，都是出於心甘情願的。這就是說我們我需要的「自由的不自由」。</p>
<h3 id="c165">在春秋社公演座上的感想 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>蟄居在鄕下稍稍久了，自然而然便染上了一種愛靜貪閑的陋習。兩三年來，不但繁華熱鬧的舞塲戲院，不大想踏進去，就連聞人的集會，友朋的宴作敘，也少有興致去參加。當年靑的神經病時代，本來是有過一次嫌人的孤獨症的，到了目下這日就衰落的中年，這病症彷彿是更有力地二次來復了，近來簡直一到了稠人廣衆之中，身體就會因恐怖而發起抖來。</p>
<p>六月四日的晚上，却因爲陪了新從北平逃難來滬的姪兒女輩去閑逛的結果，偶爾到了寗波同鄕會裏春秋社第一次公演的座上。門外雖則在下着愁的細雨，可是觀衆的座兒，也竟賣去了十之八九。向左右前後一看，坐在那裏的，儘是些成年以上的外貌端嚴的中產紳士。在這一點上，我就覺得中國的國民是進步了，對於話劇所抱的一般人的觀念，已經不同十數年前一樣，祗把牠當作學校懇親會的餘興物看了。後來看到了舞臺上的表現，（第一齣「梅雨」只看了一叚結幕，第二齣的「名優之死」却看了兩幕），說白的淸爽，動作的自然，劇中人態度的沈著，處處都使我吃了一驚，在這短短的數年之中，話劇居然也大大的進步了，進步得幾乎要使我流下淚來；因爲中國的政治，中國的社會狀態，在這幾年當中，只在一步一步的開加速度的倒車，而獨有這一方面，這一小小的素來爲社會人士所看不起的話劇方面，却獨畸形地到達了牠的長足的進境　！</p>
<p>在鄕下久伏之餘，和藝術團體的交往，自然老早已經斷絕，故而從前後左右的觀衆身上，熟面孔一張也不曾發見。因爲姪兒女輩在停幕的當中喧嚷着要去看看後臺，所以在離開演塲之前，就一脚跨到了幕後。幕後的人，有一大半，也不大認識了。在這些年靑心熱的鬥士身邊，我只看取了一股奮勇直前的豪氣，從前的那種老在竭力模仿頹廢的藝人生活的惡習，也在這新劇團的幕後驅散盡了。和幾位認識的舊人，草草招呼了一下，踏上了細雨昏沉的歸路，我坐在車裏，只默默的在想；「中國是還有希望的！」</p>
<h3 id="c166">野景 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 庶幾</p>
<p>小溝像蛇一樣宛曲着向東方流去。靠近小溝的左邊，是一條泥濘的馬路，大槪因爲附近一帶烟灶冷落的緣故罷，春雨時獨輪車的輪跡，依然重疊地留在那裏。</p>
<p>大麥已經熟了。在五月的陽光底下，南風吹過去，麥穗一排排地起伏着，彷彿黃浦江薄暮時的浪頭。麥田盡處，攢聚着一堆幽藹的野樹，隠約地翳蔽着幾間破落的農家。</p>
<p>在凸凹的阡陌上一個老年農夫緩步走着，口裏含着一支短小的烟管，烟袋墮下去，隨着他不安定的步伐，在胸前搖擺。當他經過每一畝田的時候，他總彎下已經駝了的背脊，摘下一顆麥穗，去了殼，送進嘴裏細細地咀嚼；臉上死板板地，沒有愉快的表情，也沒有苦笑的痕跡，像是久經風霜的銅像。</p>
<p>沿着阡陌向左邊彎去，大約有一箭路的光景，一畝秧田截斷了去路。在這乾燥的天時裏，睛不到幾天，田裏的水早已涸盡了。田的一角，一頭黃牛正拖着水車的木輪慢慢地，一步步地踏去，似乎在偷懶的樣子。他無意中揮一揮手，叱了一聲，黃牛吃驚似的弓起了背，豎直了尾巴，連忙加緊了脚步，然而拖不到兩圈，又遲緩下來了。他嘆了一口氣，蹲下了身體，坐在土堆上。在寂靜的空中蕩漾着潺潺的流水的嗚聲，他心裏覺得狠寗靜。</p>
<p>隔河的小路上，這時走出一個穿獵裝的外國人，塗鎳的槍管，在他粗大的手掌裏，時時閃出亮光。一條獵犬緊隨在他的背後，把鼻子貼在地面，起勁地嗅着。</p>
<p>斗然，他伏下了身子，偷偷地跳到一堆土阜後面，悄悄地舉起了槍。在近處的一顆大樹的密葉裏，正藏着一頭班鳩。</p>
<p>拍！一下槍聲！</p>
<p>獵犬竄過去，然而却撲了一個空，班鳩已經逃走了，遠遠地站在水車的架上。獵犬驚愣地回過頭來，注視牠的主人。</p>
<p>打獵的人，似乎一點也沒有失望，躡手躡足地追蹤過去，於是又舉起了槍。「喂」！那坐在土堆上的農夫，看見獵人的槍口，正對準水車，恐怕傷了他的黃牛，連忙把烟管在空中揮了幾揮。</p>
<p>外國人只傲慢地瞧了他一下，仍舊把他的視線集中在班鳩的腹部。</p>
<p>農夫更加慌張了，怱怱地奔過去。</p>
<p>就在這一剎那，拍的一聲！</p>
<p>獵犬隔着河勇敢地撲過去，當牠前面的兩隻脚，剛剛抓住岸的草根時，一個黑影在牠眼前倒下來，牠機警地一翻身，墮入水裏，接着有機點鮮紅的血雨從空中緊跟下去，染污了牠光潔的毛皮。</p>
<h3 id="c167">斑鳩 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 周光熙</p>
<p>天又在下着雨，斑鳩老是在屋角上呌。</p>
<p>據說這樣的雨天，斑鳩並不是高興在呌的。實在他的呌是在訴苦。他每到陰大，身上便會發出一種怪難受的臭味，斑鳩太太忍無可忍時，祗得用她的長喙啄他，把他驅逐出窠來。所以一到雨天，斑鳩受着太太的壓迫，祗好有家歸不得地在雨脚下飛着，在屋角上呌着。「鵓鴣鴣！鵓鴣鴣！」這是他傷心的泣訴！</p>
<p>可是認能同情他呢？這陰鬰的雨天，沒有一個人不感覺沈悶，雨將人關在房子裏，旣不能出去看朋友，朋友也不能來看自己，於是人們因爲恨着雨，更連帶恨這屋角上幽怨惱人的呌聲「鵓鴣鴣！鵓鴣鴣！」</p>
<p>「眞呌到人頭腦子裏來了。」一個人說。「再聽下去，我可要發狂了」。另一個人說。是的，認能原諒他是被太太逼出來訴苦的呢？大家拿石子投他，於是斑鳩先生祗好忍氣吞聲，飛到別處。</p>
<p>水從斑鳩先生頸項，翅膀上流下來，他不得不在另一個屋角上停下來，他仍然要訴苦要發出「鶉鴣鴣」的呌聲。可是被攻擊咒罵是他的命運，無處不被人投着石塊。沒有一個人可憐他，同情他。這樣的怨訴，根本惱人的，不論你是被太太逼出來的也好，你受了苦，不許哭訴，你祗配閉了你的鳥嘴，忍着苦在風裏雨裏飛着直到天睛！</p>
<p>然而什麼時候才會晴起來呢，這悠悠的梅雨的天氣呀。</p>
<h3 id="c168">紅蘿蔔鬚 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Julen　Kenato作林取譯</p>
<p>敎父（續）</p>
<p>「最要緊的是要等你的浮木沉下去三次之後才把釣竿舉起來。」他對紅蘿蔔鬚說。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨爲什麼要三次呢？</p>
<p>敎父丨頭一次是毫沒有什麼意義的：魚把釣鈎輕輕咬着。第一次，這便不是玩的了：魚把釣鈎吞下了。第三次，這便十分可靠了：魚是再也不能逃走了。我們也决不要舉得太遲的。</p>
<p>但紅蘿蔔鬚最喜歡釣河沙魚。他把鞋子脫掉，跳在水裏，用脚把沙底攪着，把水弄渾。河沙魚嚇得亂竄，紅蘿蔔鬚便把釣竿一揚又是一個。紅蘿蔔鬚忙不及地向敎父叫着：</p>
<p>「十六，十七，十八：：：：」</p>
<p>敎父看見太陽照到頭頂上了，便一同回去用午餐。他把蠶豆拚命往紅蘿蔔鬚的肚裏塞。�</p>
<p>「我覺得再沒有什麼東西比蠶豆好吃的了，」他對紅蘿蔔鬚說，「但我要把它煮得稀爛才吃。啃着一顆沒有煮爛的蠶豆，正像吃付雞時在翅膀底下嚼着一粒彈丸一樣，發出響聲，那眞比咬着鶴嘴鋤上的鐵還難受。」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚|我們現在吃的蠶豆是落口卽溶的。媽媽平素煮的蠶豆並不很壞。但却同我們現在吃的不一樣。她沒有把汁調得到家。</p>
<p>敎父|畜生，我看了你吃眞感着幾分高興呢。我敢斷言你在你母親那兒是絕沒有儘量吃過的。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚|這全看她的胃口怎樣。如果她在肚子餓了，那麼我也可以多吃一點。因爲她自已添取時，便另外給我一點。如果她自己不添的話，那麼我也跟着完了。</p>
<p>敎父|但你可以問她再要呀，蠢東西！</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚|這事說說當然容易呀，老爹。與其在問她要，那還不如餓肚子的好。</p>
<p>敎父|而我呢，沒有孩子的我，是給猿兒舐屁股都願意的，如果那猿兒是我的孩子的話！你們去把這事調理一下罷。</p>
<p>餐後，他們便一路至葡萄田裏去了，紅蘿蔔鬚在那兒時而看着他的敎父工作，緊跟在後面，時面睡在一束葡萄藤上面，眼睛望着天空，嘴裏含着一些柳樹的新芽。</p>
<p>泉水</p>
<p>和敎父同睡一事眞使他視爲畏途。房間裏旣然很冷，而那舖着鴨毛的臥床却又熱得要命。敎父的衰老的肢體感着溫和的鴨毛，一會兒使得敎男渾身流汗了。可是他能夠和他的母親隔得很遠的睡覺，這一點是使他高興的。</p>
<p>「然則她竟使怕得要命嗎？」敎父問。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚|你不如說我沒有使得她够害怕我還對些。當她想要給我哥哥什麼敎訓時，他便抓着一柄掃帚，一動也不動地站在他面前，我可以對你發誓：這樣一來，她便馬上停住了。因此，她寗願用感情去打動他。她說菲利克斯的性情是那樣易於感動的，所以人家用不着打他，打之一法對於我的性情是比較適宜的。</p>
<p>敎父|你也應當拿一柄掃帚去試試看呀，紅蘿蔔鬚。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚|啊！祗要我敢做就好啦！我和菲利克斯是常常打架的，有時打着好頑，有時是認眞相打的。我的力氣和他一樣强。我可以和他一樣抵抗着。可是如果我拿着一柄掃帚去打媽媽的話，她一定會以爲我是拿給她的，那掃帚便會從我的手裏落到她的手裏，也許她在打着我之前，還會對我說聲謝謝呢。（未完）</p>

<p>對徐悲鴻畫、觀者極其贊嘆、爭欲一識其人、故當日君夫婦、招待極忙、有握手不及者、新聞記者咸集、有攝影盛况者、有攝影徐君夫婦招待者、忙碌之至、會塲緊張之空氣、開幕之日、受彼邦之重視親善已如此、我國已給異域以極良好印象、此時法國要人在京尤多、前途之榮光可以料定、國際空氣或將由此印象而較佳焉、我國以眞善美所提倡之美術表、現得因此放光明於世界矣、</p>

<p>交通勝復旦</p>
<p>|結果八比四|</p>
<p>▲前四局復旦共得三分</p>
<p>▲第五局交通連取七分</p>
<p>上海華人棒球、淹沒已久、昨日復旦與交通兩大學作江大體協會棒球專標賽於中華棒球塲、此爲國人棒球賽之第一聲、爰詳爲紀述如下、以換讀者口胃、並示提倡之意、</p>
<p>（評球勢）兩隊實力、以復旦較硬、投手顧得剛、臂力强勁、管束力佳、接手李長芳、亦甚穏健、前四局復旦以三比零勝、以爲可操勝券、不料第五局上、復旦陣容慌亂、不可收拾、投手顧得剛並違放三次「四球數」、使交大氣𦦨突盛、連獲七分、復旦反遭四比八之敗績、殊可惜也、兩隊陣線如下、</p>
<p>▲交通位置▲復旦位置</p>
<p>劉有章二壘馮朝亮三壘</p>
<p>李北良遊擊金鎭東游擊</p>
<p>溫聯東中堅顧得剛投手</p>
<p>沈觀瀾首壘黎耀華首壘</p>
<p>王長穎三壘王樹森右翼</p>
<p>龔以斌右翼安炳武中堅</p>
<p>陳公興左翼李長芳接手</p>
<p>石壽頤接手王正寅左翼</p>
<p>吳應瓊投手周啟慶二壘</p>
<p>（第一局）</p>
<p>復旦先攻開始、首打員馮朝亮揮棍得一壘、金鎭東「三打」出局、馮則乘機偷二壘、顧得剛「安打」越首壘、馮朝亮力　生還、先得一分、黎耀華高球被左翼殺死、李長芳代顧得剛進至三壘、王樹森無功下塲、換楊後、交大劉有章先打、球至二壘被殺、李北良高球爲投手接、溫聯東「三打」出局、無功而還、（復旦一丨交通零）</p>
<p>（第二局）</p>
<p>交大佈陣、有美妙之「雙合殺」表演、復旦安炳武錯得壘（因對方失誤）後、李長芳振臂力擊、球飛左塲、被三壘員王長穎妙接、李乃下塲、而一壘上之安炳武、正偷奔二壘王長穎急送球與二壘劉有章、安亦被殺、可惜交通投手吳應瓊不爭氣、放四球數與王正寅、加以二壘之失手、接手之誤擲、被王正寅生還、周啟慶至二壘下局、交大仍負一分、換塲後、交通沈觀瀾「三打」出局、王長穎死於高球、龔以斌「四球」得壘、陳公興一籌莫展、第二局乃終、（復旦一丨交通零）</p>
<p>（第三局）</p>
<p>是局開始、交通佈陣極嚴、無隙可奪、復旦馮朝亮顧得剛均以高球六塲、黎耀華孤注一擲定神注目、揮棍猛擊、球向中場高飛、以爲可得「本壘打」、但交通溫聯東瞄個正着、救出阿斗、速殺三人、極爲容易、復旦佈陣後、交通除吳應瓊「四球」得壘外、亦均無進展、（復旦零丨交通零）</p>
<p>（第四局）</p>
<p>復旦王樹森因交大三壘與一壘間之錯誤、得直達三壘、造成級好機會、安炳武一振得首壘、歸本壘、加一分、李長芳王正寅未得手、乃換場、交通李北良出場得首壘、溫聯東塞翁失馬、因李之被殺得佔首壘、沈觀瀾「三擊」六場、王長穎亦無功而還、局乃終、（復旦一丨交通零）</p>
<p>（第五局）</p>
<p>復旦三人未得手、換局後、交大氣𦦨突盛、精神煥發、而復旦投手顧得剛、反改變常態、球出軟弱、放龔以斌以「四球」得壘、陳公興登場猛擊、球勢低急、穿過二</p>
<p>壘、龔陳各佔一壘、石壽頤被殺後、吳應瓊又進一壘、於是三壘均佔、形勢緊張、當此時也、爲投手吃重時期不可茍且、但顧得剛經交通球員吶喊助陣、心中似頗着急、竟又放劉有章以「四球數」、於是在三壘上之龔以斌、不勞而獲一分、以下李北良高球出局後、交通僅餘一人、復旦如能嚴密監察、猶不至於遭大患、安知顧得剛再放四球數」、溫聯東亦進一壘、陳公興遂亦生還、連得兩分、而交通復滿佔三壘、於是復旦愈形慌張、錯誤疊出、一失足鑄成千古恨、交通聲勢乃愈振、往後沈觀瀾王長穎各奏奇功、龔以恂並得「二壘打」、李北良（代吳應瓊跑）、劉有章、溫聯東、沈觀瀾、王長穎、又先後歸邇、共得七分之多、反以七比三勝復旦、（復旦零丨交通七）</p>
<p>（第六局）</p>
<p>是局復旦均至半途折回、王樹森曾至第三壘、卒亦被殺下場、交大石壽頤先上壘、吳應瓊「三打」出局、劉有章高球被接、李北良打出生路、溫聯東一擊命中、石壽頤生還加一分、勝利之希望、乃愈形鞏固、（復旦零丨交大一）</p>
<p>（第七局）</p>
<p>復旦一線生機、全在此局、謹愼將事、徐圖宏展、無如交大陣容、嚴密無瑕、王正寅周祝慶先後下場、奉馮朝亮得安打、金鎭東繼下、馮乃生還、顧打無效、僅獲一分、總結果交通以八比四反敗爲勝、（下半局交通未打）司壘裁判劉達成、司球裁判周家騏、各局比數如下、</p>

<h3 id="c192">不憂廟畔看龍船 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>盛大的龍舟競渡，我生平只是耳聞，不曾目見。南北兩濠划龍船，有種種的名色；什麼擋頭篙，什麼做勝會，什麼出水晉頭，僅僅在父老口中相傳至今。這些盛舉，還是洪楊以前的事；當時，物力豐富，民生不見兵革，到了端陽，老百姓當然修到這般眼福。現在呢，商業不景氣，還加着國難嚴重，端陽尙且革除，何况龍船？合該我們沒有這眼福了。</p>
<p>有人說，端陽可以革除，龍船不妨提倡，雖是個玩意兒，郤含有水上體育的精神。我說：不錯，你不見廣州大玩龍船麼？我看到紀載龍船的最近粵報，彷彿在字裏行間聽到一起起鑼鼓的聲音。這一天，萬人空巷看龍船，最盛的所在，如荔枝灣西郊，如馬涌積利濟橋兩岸，可稱人山人海。嬌滴滴的摩登婦女，懸掛香囊的放學兒童，呼朋引侶的商店人員，雇着　舫紫洞艇的豪商富紳，都是衆口一詞的「看龍船去。」大槪不是「玩物喪志」吧，說得體面一些，這呌做鼓舞水上體育的熱忱。</p>
<p>龍船有三五艘一起的，有七八艘一起的，有十餘艘以上一起的；在那游划往來的當兒，絡繹不絕的酒肉和錦標，得到許多有吃有袋的稿賞；河南面的不憂廟前，尤其是水健兒十分賣力的所在。頑到晌午，天公雖不做美；但是，毛毛雨趕不散游人，海珠橋上依舊是人頭擠擠，頭上濕淋淋，只算在冷水龍頭下沐一回髪，有什麼妨礙？</p>
<p>論理，不憂廟畔看龍船，望文生訓，便該無憂無慮的了，誰料，打不破「樂極悲來」的老話！其時，大石莊頭，黎塘，大塘等鄕的龍船三十餘艘，在馬涌橋一帶環繞數匝；橋上的觀衆太起勁了，擠坍了橋的一部分，以致有男女二十餘人同時落水。結果，只救起了十餘個負傷的人，其他，貪了眼福，竟遭着滅頂之凶了！屈大夫不檢寂寞，又得了幾個同志，這眞是煞風景的事啊。</p>
<h3 id="c193">願來生化作女兒身 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>不出閨門的大小姐，如今都衣袖兒高高，鞋跟兒高高，每天上公事房，上寫字間。而且挺高了胸，合男子爭一日之雄長，外加眼高於頂，再也不把臭男子放在眼裏。女子服務於社會，甚麼都高人一等，直把二萬萬鬚眉一個個嚇矮了三寸。瞧，爲了「提倡女子職業」，男職員便成批成隊的砸碎了飯碗，啞吧吃黃連，有苦沒處說。反對這一手，便被人罵二十世紀裏，還不懂得女子服務的大道理，眞是冬烘頭腦。若是自命摩登，不甘落伍，而兀是摸着花白鬍子，大談其女子服務，那對不起，惟有請你把吃飯地盤，讓給女子，再也沒有第二法門的了。</p>
<p>左也不妥，右也不對，在這年頭兒，做人難做男子漢。「行不得也哥哥」，做了哥哥行不得，乾脆，不是做妹妹，倒還有人說聲「我愛你」。不做男子漢，而爲女兒身，別的且不說，就以在報上登</p>
<p>「徵求配偶」廣告而言，登了一天，不吹牛，二三十對體貼溫存，緾綿悱惻的粉紅信封應徵信，是十拿九穏會有的。這眞會使得登「徵婚」廣告而接得打趣，奚落，譏訕等應聲的臭男子，相形之下，氣得一佛出世二佛涅槃，三佛如何，不可究詰。</p>
<p>天哪，我是一個男子漢，此生休矣，所以我拚命的預備在這一世裏，敲穿一百二十個木魚，願來生化作女兒身，用幾個不花錢的義務男僕，替我開門，對我讓坐，外加披大衣，獻殷懃，抱哈叭狗。但不知我這于思滿頰的臭男子，有沒有由慈航道人一變而爲觀世音菩薩的福分，眞使我十七八個吊桶，上上落落，有些放不下心兒。</p>

<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>俗話說得好，「大人說話，說錯說說過。小人說話，說錯打屁股」這是形容做大之易，做小之難，不論什麼地方，只要你是做大的，總得多少佔點便宜。</p>
<p>譬如：在官場中，你如果是一個大官，那麼，隨便你怎樣說都好，就是撒一個屁，誰敢捏一下鼻子，說一聲臭。否則，你如果是一個芝麻綠豆的小官，那你見了上司，口口聲聲，大人稱呼，不但說話要小心，並且禮貌也差不得一點。譬如：在商場中，你如果是一個大夥</p>
<p>先生，那麼，一舉一動，無拘無束，東家把全權委託了你，作憑對夥計們，說話不在道理，做事不合人情，做小夥計的除非是一個「戇大」誰敢來插一句嘴，道一個「不」字？不然，就請便，老子用不着你。</p>
<p>譬如：在家庭中，兄弟數人，你如果是一個「大哥」，福氣好的話，「你的老子」，活着做牛做馬，掙下了一筆「家當」，等到他老人家一口氣不來，「嗚呼哀哉」，「壽终正寢」之後，那麼，兄弟中「三一三十一」，分起這筆「家當」來，當然，是你做大哥的便宜，可以多得一點，排行越小的，所得的也越少，至於「老婆」，也是做大的便宜，做小的吃虧，因爲做小老婆的，只好住住小房子，就是得和大老婆在大公館裏住在一起，那麼，處處地方，須仰承大老婆的鼻息，否則，沒有辦法，依然只好住小房子：：我寫到這裏，還想寫下去，或者見了說：好了，算了罷，照你這般講來，只要是做大的，總是容易的，占便宜的。做小的，總是難的，吃虧的。那麼，我們中華民國，是一個大國，爲什麼，如禽給一個小國丨日本丨吃　呢？我說：這只好諉之於氣數，嘸啥話頭！</p>

<p>第八回償語激靑年辭官遁去</p>
<p>熱心憐少女挾壙親來</p>
<p>現在見了他，不覺酸酣苦辣，一切的味兒都有了，因故意裝着笑容道：沒有別的事情，只是我有一件不得意的消息，要告訴楊老太太，就是我怕人家說我靠了哥哥吃飯，我已經把差事辭掉了。現在我帶着行李，離開了家庭，到城裏去找事。趙自强那裏知道他有什麼用意，覺得這個人，倒還有些志氣，便道：甘先生到城裏去寓在什麼地方呢？積之心想，讓他知道自己的地址也好，他若是轉告了桂枝，桂枝若同意於我的話，他一定還會到城裏去找我的。便道：我現在是個窮措大了，當然住不起旅館，也不願意去吵鬧朋友，我就住在川東會館裏。趙連長進城順步的時候，可以到我那裏去玩玩。說畢，取下帽子點個頭就走了。趙自强根本不知道他和桂枝發生了愛情，關於他三角戀愛的那個疑團，更是作夢也不會想到。以爲他來告訴人丟了差事，還是乞憐的意思，那曉得他是一種氣話呢。當天時候到了，他不曾等着江氏母女回家，就已回營去。第二次是三天以後才回來，一進門，在前面院子裏遇到了江氏，打過招呼之後，就告訴他道：對過甘二爺上次到這兒辭行來了。他的差事丟了，您知道嗎？江氏笑道：我們不過也是一個平常街坊，沒有什麼來往，他的差事倒丟了。說着，向趙自强身上打量了一番。心裏可就想着，爲什麼要你報告我們這樣一個消息呢？大槪甘二爺丟了差事，他心裏是很得意了。江氏心裏如此想着，他並不去和桂枝說。他想着甘二爺的一舉一動，姑娘都是知道的。這次且不說破，看姑娘還是知道不知道。（九二）</p>

<p>上虞爲晋王謝樓隠遊觀之地，擅山水之勝，賦氣所踵，人才輩出，余耳其名，不克往遊，癸西初夏，因組織上虞紅卍字分會，乃得償夙願。二十八日午，同人相約往游鳳鳴山，山距城南十餘里，初不知道之遠近，及往，愈行愈遠，石徑紆回，如黃河九曲，萃峯皆高擁雲表，路旁水聲潺湲，景物幽閟。比至山麓，仰其上石級層層，樹木葱蘢，雲氣縹渺，有高閣擁出，如在半天，高不可攀，同游者咸欲却步，余行年六十，猶有壯志，鼓勇直上，至巔頂，尙不覺疲乏，蓋得力於坐功歟？上山後，席地稍坐，循徑入一祠，守祠者杜姓，名信昌，年五十餘，非道非僧，已老病不能伺應賓客矣。山產茶，味頗淸香，山居者烹以餉客，渴者得此，如飲瓊漿。仰瞻祠宇，正殿三楹，環左右樓六楹，祠有夢神殿，每年長至節，男女卜休咎者紛至，宿左右樓中祈夢，夢輒奇騐。祠名仙姑，相傳漢時有仙女乘鸞至此，仙去後，里人建祠祀之。祠左有飛瀑，懸於山半，其聲與松濤相上下，龍吟虎嘯，至此應慮盡滌。瀑旁一石洞，亦以仙姑名，蓋卽仙人駐憇之所，洞深遼幽寂，僅存一席，不能人，其門已爲後人塞之。正凝視間，忽有鳥飛鳴入石　，色靑，大如鵲而尾長，聲與常鳥不同，黃濟悟兄謂爲靑鸞，余弗信，比歸來閱絲志，果載此山有仙女乘鸞作鳳鳴，樓息於此，山卽以之得名，其後仙去鸞留，尙有見之者，余所見之靑彎其形較小，或亦仙鸞之苗裔歟？吾儕久居滬濱，繁華喧鬧，志慮昏沈，際身此間，俗念頓消，心神爲之一快，因思世道衰徵，頻年災刦，人民如居惡夢之中，亟盼鳳鳴歸隠而不可得，今靑鸞竟現，得毌鳳鳥將至之先兆歟？故樂爲之記。</p>

<p>该塲去東門約一公里，田連阡陌，雲水相映，村婦裹頭跣足，或分身於田，或負薪於途，孰謂中國女子盡屬寄生耶？自東門至西門，街長十里許，巿　櫛比，別饒風味，唯幾間布莊，所陳列者，皆印度綢洋紗布之類，益信外貨之侵吾國巿塲，如水就下，已無往面不人矣，不禁令人感慨系之！</p>

<p>故戲法家的術語說，「戲法無眞，當堂說破，」其實戲法家那裏肯說破呢，假定說破，便一錢不值，故能夠說破的，祇有一些表面上的東西，內容决不肯說破的，但旣是戲法，任何人多能知道他們所變，多不是眞的，就是當堂不說破，認以爲眞的，恐怕絕無僅有，且也沒有這樣的傻子，不過因爲他們變得高明，於是博得一般觀衆們的驚異與猜測，或說是這樣變的，或說是那樣變的，仁者見仁，智者見智，使人如墮五里霧中，到底莫名其城隍廟。</p>
<p>但是有一點，藝術家須得明白，任你會變，大家多曉得是假的，多曉得是掉槍花，多曉得是易眼法，多曉得是弄玄虛，在這一點上，大家都認識的，但是認識儘管認識，而藝術家依舊要變，好在觀衆們已經買了票入塲，坐在這個戲臺下，不怕你不看，你看，天然要會鈔，你不看，也要你會鈔，你只能看坐在臺下打磕腰，伸懶臉，喊氣悶，不與我們相干。</p>
<p>這原是藝術家的一套慣技。</p>

<p>— 蘋</p>
<p>記得五六歲的時候，雖然進了小學，但那種不完備的小學，一般兒童在這裏，並沒有什麼新的發見。每個兒童，都照着先生「溫文爾雅」的葫蘆書樣子。放學以後，三五成羣的擇個鄙靜而陰暗的大門樓，聚在一處，開始講故事。什麼孫行者一個觔斗滾十萬八千里，滾不過如來佛的手掌；什麼張三爺騎着黃騾，站在長板坡的橋頭，大喊一聲，把曹操的八十萬兵馬，駭得屁滾尿流；什麼呂洞賓八仙過海的故事，這一類不經不傳，無稽之談，天天講的爛熟。不但聽衆天大照例的聽，那講者仍覺得越講越有味兒。當時我們村中的十幾個小孩，好像都沒有聰明似的，我能在別的地方，聽到新的故事，馬上回來，召集大衆，那又可幾天娓娓不倦。此外就是跑廠城，點瓜種荳，殺羊，跳關，種種不適兒童箇性的游戲。</p>
<p>革命軍鼎定長江流域之後，那時一般兒童的舉動就不同了：排隊呀，吹號呀，個個削一支刀或劍。放學後就開始戰鬭的演習，把以前街巷不分的習慣拋棄，劃定界限，彼此斯殺，互相仇視。演至一個兒童，不敢在界以外自由活動。就是講故事，也喜歡聽打倒軍閥，打倒帝國主義之類了。</p>
<p>近幾年來，更形進步。散漫的兒童，已經組成了隊伍，有旗子，有木槍，有隊長，有司令官，並有護兵掛着紙烟盒做成手槍，給司令護衛，還有偵探等。自己稱爲革命軍，稱對方的兒童爲矮子小鬼，遇見了就喊殺。打倒，衝鋒，解决，報告，都說的爛熟。也有演說，口號。普通用石子代替彈丸，演習戰鬬。雙方約定時候，尋個坪曠作陣地，一聲衝鋒號響了，一齊動手，石如雨下。打出血來了，大家認爲達到目的，鼓掌大噪，勝利凱旋。被打的兒童，自己也覺有趣，用手帕裹住了傷處，還和同伴商量後分的辦法，决不畏縮，對於家庭，還得瞞過。兒童變遷，在這進化過程中，處處受着社會的暗示；兒童對於社會狀態演進，認爲新奇有趣，影響所及，處處模仿。總括起來，我們應敢注意下列幾點：</p>
<p>㈠由文嗣而趨於勇武</p>
<p>㈡由數漫而趨於組織</p>
<p>㈢由靜而趨於動</p>
<p>㈣由死板板地而趨於活潑地，尤其於思想方面，進步眞快，現在七八歲的兒童，知識要超過一二十年前的十三四歲的兒童。我們要知道社會進步速，兒童思想進步亦速，兒童種種的舉動，都是社會上一般狀態的縮影。我們要改進民族，那末兒童敎育，是第一工作。</p>

<p>— 彭年</p>
<p>誰都說靑年是國家未來的主人翁，是社會未來的建設者：改造新國家，建設新社會，以及一切的一切，都須仗着靑年的力量去推進或發展，所以說：靑年的力量，是能生產國家富有，靑年的力量，是能擴展社會發達，要國家强盛，要社會良好，必先培養靑年，看重靑年，愛護靑年。雖然是這樣說，但是有許多人偏偏不是這樣做丨這或許自己故意的丨反而要去傷失，這是甚麼緣故呢？你看：「報上××靑年因憂國而自盡，××靑年因失戀而自刎，××靑年因失學而自縊：：：」這在報上每日可以看到的事實，毌須我多　　舌：不過那種自殺靑年，</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>是否社會制度不良而致的，抑或出於自願，這是值得深刻研究的問題，若果自殺出於自願，那末自殺者在遺書上何不說：「此死我願。」却偏偏寫「××未遂而至自殺。」由此看來，大半自殺的人，一定不是自己所願意的。</p>
<p>自殺者多，於國家於社會有好處的嗎？我看未必。上面不是說過嗎？「靑年是國家未來的主人翁，是社會未來的建設者。」靑年旣然能幹做國家未來的主人翁，做社會未來的建設者，當然有他們可以做的能力，有他們可以負這個偉大責任的肩膀，否則，人家那肯這樣稱呼呢？旣如此說，國家傷一個靑年，使是傷一分元氣，社會少一個靑年，便是少一分力量，呵！國家不培養他們，</p>
<p>社會不看重他們，他們似乎也沒有愛護自己的道理了。</p>
<p>種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆，總之這是社會制度不良的結果，譬如說：「一艘航行大海中的帆航，把舵的人一旦脫了舵，這艘帆船，能鎭定嗎？必至隨浪漂流，决無航行正軌之理。」這是誰的責任？這當然歸罪把舵的。社會和靑年的關係，也不正如此嗎？所以我們要减少靑年自殺，必先把社會制度改造一下，否則，所有的靑年正要隨自殺的高潮，隨波而去。</p>

<p>㈠趕猪玀</p>
<p>只要你照子亮，揀那一對對手挽手的摩登男女，跟上去說兩聲：「少爺少奶奶！稱心如意」，他們窩了心，在她「格格」一笑之下，自然他會從西裝袋裏撒出一把銅子，或者莧是一個　毫。</p>
<p>㈡接汽車</p>
<p>這是頂括括的賺錢不吃力的生意，只要你佔據得到幾爿大公司，大旅館，跳舞場，西菜社的地盤國，等有光亮的黑牌汽車停下來，就疾舒猿臂的將汽車門一開，嘴裏喊聲：「少爺」「小姐奶奶走好」！代價起碼兩角。</p>
<p>㈢告地狀</p>
<p>做這門生意，身上別穿得過於襤褸，以示留落他鄕，不過暫時落難的光景，而且要寫得一手粉筆字，懂得一些外國文，像我做小學敎員的人去改刀，那是再合式也沒有，可是進益，却遠遜於接汽車了。</p>
<p>㈣看廟門</p>
<p>看廟門，以前呌做「戤石獅」，他的揀主顧，恰巧和趕猪玀相反，嘴裏喃喃念着「那摩」的十八世紀的時式太太，呌幾聲：「積福積壽」，包你有不算過分的滿意。</p>

<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>可憐我是個窮小子，從小生我的父母都死了，我也記不得是誰家的兒子。有個姓馮的道士，將我撫養到八歲，後來他的妻子也死了，無人養我，宿在露天荒野。末了，有個本鎭的鄕公所的辦事員姓俞的，將我領到他家裏。他夫妻倆年都四十以外，很仁慈的，沒有兒女就將我作爲他們的兒子。但是族中反對，不能　爲姓俞的子孫，只能作爲過房兒子。生父旣不記得，從了馮道士的姓，就姓了馮。不料到了今年春頭，我的義父姓俞的，又死了，身後極其苦窘，連殯殮也是族中帮忙，草草了事的，我義母雖然苦得很，不忍將吾趕出去，現在母子二人苦苦度日。但是我義父生前欠債很多，雖有兩個兄弟，各不相關，各債主還是天天來坐索。我義母終日啼哭，手中一無所有，族中人呢，貼幾個錢買米吃，是可以的，要拿出錢來，跟我死去的義父還債，是萬做不到的。我現在只有十三歲，沒有掙錢的能耐，萬一我義母被債戶逼死了，我的小命也沒有了。我不願再做第四個的兒子，只好投河死了。做好事的先生，有什麼方法救救我母子兩人的命呢！苦孩馮谷香叩頭。</p>
<p>編者按：在這種經濟末落的時代，一個人欠上些債，是很普通的。幸喜這種普通的現象，竟會得到立法家的憐憫。現在任何一國的法律丨連中國在內丨對於一個負債者，除非他有意將財產隠慝起來，存心　懶，那末要受制裁外；要是眞的無法償付，也就沒有什麼罪責了。欠了債，要割肉等一類的事實，現在是禁止的。「不怕兇，只怕窮」，差不多已經被法律所默許了。自己欠的債，尙且如此，配偶生前所欠的債，被繼承人生前所欠的債，更可以置之不理。你們母子兩人，現在已經窮到這步田地，論理祗有別人來怕你的分兒。你們還怕人家則甚？現在姓俞的族中人，肯貼幾個錢你們買米吃，終算萬幸。你現在應該勸勸你義母，萬事不要放在心上；儘管黃米飯，蘿葡乾，還是努力加餐。你呢！應當振作自己的志氣，候一個機會，知甘識苦，以求將來的出路。末了，我們還希望讀此通訊者，在能力之內，與以援手。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>「顧先生近來一向好嗎？長久不見了！」「謝謝，謝謝！蘇部長回北京去還沒有回來麼？」「可不是。這幾天有電報給顧先生嗎？」「前天來過一次電，說是在最近快要回來了」。「這位是張先生」，五夫人向顧經理介紹了：「是我的親戚，不知道見過沒有？」「哦！對了，很面熟的。：：…」顧先生說。「見過的，那次蘇部長請客，：：：」只消提起那次請客，張文彬便覺得很得意，因爲他從來不曾忘懷那種做招待的光榮。這時候五夫人覺着很是侷促，過於不能放肆，而顧經理也懂得五夫人已經不是從前的柳姑娘人。</p>
<p>「那末現在是從府上來？」又是顧先生說。</p>
<p>「不，買了一點東西，現在不過來支些零欵回去用用。」</p>
<p>「啊！好極了，好極了。」</p>
<p>說着，再拉了一下手顧先生便出門去了。五夫人坐着車子回家，自然不免回想起從前親暱的情景，然而給張少爺一陣擁抱也就丟開了。</p>
<p>二十四·罪與罰</p>
<p>蘇部長自北京回來，已是四五天以前的事了。但是這幾天都住在二姨太太那裏。前天下午到這邊來住過一晚，很快樂的，可是今天一來，却大不相同，走進門便殺氣衝天，好像要吃人似的。五夫人當然立刻迎了上來，領着他走進臥室，可是他更加氣忿，拍着桌子指着荷香罵：</p>
<p>「快！你這班狗東西！快去喊那姓張的小子出來」。</p>
<p>一會兒張文彬果然戰戰兢兢的立在他的面前，只聽得他破口大罵：</p>
<p>「你這小子！你是什麼東西？你敢這樣大膽？！滾！滾！：：：快給我滾！」</p>
<p>「到底是爲着什麼呀？你這樣大發脾氣。」五夫人到這時總不能不開口了。</p>
<p>「什麼事？你還問我什麼事？你們這樣的無恥還有臉來問我嗎？顧守　將」</p>
<p>你們的事完全告訴我了，還有錯的嗎？台灣銀行的十幾萬存欵都給你們輸完了</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>「哼！做得好事！</p>
<p>「現在沒有什麼可說，敎張文彬馬上離開這裏，馬上走，快！」</p>
<p>五夫人這時直是氣極了，加之再看張文彬一聲也不敢響的退下去，更加氣忿，幾乎要流出眼淚，於是狠狠將蘇老頭子看了一眼，驕傲的笑了一下，好像滿有把握似的，平心靜氣的說：</p>
<p>「好的，老頭子，你現在就來欺負我了。你這樣的給我掃　，你知汽他是</p>
<p>「好的，你現就違約了，你記得你以先是怎樣答應我的嗎？」</p>
<p>然而這時候的蘇部長到底不便示弱，這不是趁着一股火氣衝出大門去了。</p>

<h3 id="c226">好萊塢影城的一瞥 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 橫</p>
<p>合理化的分部組織</p>
<p>是發展的最大原因</p>
<p>電影在很短的期間而有這樣長足的進步，實在令人驚嘆。曾幾何時，龐大合理化的組織，各部分設備的擴張，已經代替了從前那在太陽光下的戶外製片塲以及那蹩脚的玻璃棚。現在好萊塢各大影片公司都自己建立起小城巿來了。</p>
<p>在他們各公司的城牆範圍裏面，分爲數區，而在數英里的短街平道交織之下建立在宅區，工業區，商業區等等。裏面的設備有醫院，有學校，强迫學齡上兒童們每天讀幾個鐘頭的書，有敏捷的救火隊站，有茶樓菜館。除此以外就是廣大的製片塲所。攝影塲本身，有好幾座，巍峨的圖書館，劇務部，化裝部，編劇部，宣傳部以及其他的執行部，當然其中會計部也是很重要的，警察自然更是裏面最主要的設備，他們的職務是維持路政的秩序，注意熱鬧時日，羣衆的擁擠，戒備和保護金錢的輸送，特別是轉運到遠的地方。總之他們的任務是保衛全影城一切的福利。</p>
<p>電影在技術上有這樣偉大的進步，這些合理化的分部組織，可說是最大的原因。研究與試騐工作的結果，已經給燈光，攝影機，佈景，和收音以驚人的進展，而使各種技術臻於完美之境。</p>
<p>一部影片必須經過許多階段，那便是選擇故事，分配演員，設置佈景，拍攝，剪接，配音等技術的合作，才成功一部完美的「藝術品。」可是此地却有一個危機，那就是過分的注重技術。「拙劣的技術固然是可以損傷影片，而好的技術却未曾產生過惡劣的片子。」（？）這自然是不談意識而專門胡調的美國Well　Made　Plays的觀點。因不在題內，故不多述了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c227">評「生意經」 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Stranger　in　Town</p>
<p>在目前世界金融陷於非常混亂而經濟崩潰的情形之下，銀行的倒閉，商店的週轉不靈，已經成爲世界各國普遍的現象。美國當然不會例外，而且是表現得最爲明顯，特別是羅斯福就任總統的時候。當然這種動盪的激潮，决不是偶�</p>
<p>然的現象，而是現有的經濟組織臨到了最後必然崩潰的階段。</p>
<p>那末在這動盪中的小商店，當然會受着極大的犧牲，而是不能倖免的必然的結果。所以「生意經」的作者以此爲題材，的確是非常好的選擇，同時這種非常的情况，也是必然的會反映到藝術作品上來。</p>
<p>但是「生意經」的作者對於這一新鮮的題材是怎樣理解的呢？誠然，許多小商店都會在這時候實行減價或是其他變形的競賣，以求撈回成本，而大資本的企業家更因工業生產品的過剩而减低價格盡力推銷，甚至於直接的推銷，深入到每一個鄕村中去。這樣一來，巿塲更加混亂，而營業上的競爭更加尖銳。當然，小資本者一定不能長久支持，何况一切貨物都需現欵批發，而銀行又相繼倒閉以致於無法週轉，到最後自然只有歇業以至於破產。</p>
<p>可是在這中間還有一不能避免的現象，那便是由於物價的降低，因而農產品的賤賣，以至農村破產而發生購買力的削减。自然這是一種很大的矛盾，雖是商品如何減價，終於不能敎顧主競買的吧？然而「生意經」的作者却忽視了這些，他以爲只須價格的减低，農村顧主便會趨之若鶩。同時當克雷希爾老人的雜貨商店，已陷於困境的時候，而說是貨品不敷應用，終於由於孫女婿的關係賖來大批貨物。而且這樣是否可以復興起來呢？自然不可能的。</p>
<p>至於這樣的題材，雖然意識上不免模糊，可是以喜劇形式的演出，倒是非常好的。同時愛情的穿插，雖然沒有十分的必要，但亦不勉强。不過開始時那五十年前的序幕，却是多餘的一個塲面。有些笑料却嫌重複而且誇張，同時一場情話，也覺得多少損害了全劇的情調。還有最後的一部貨車橫衝直撞，也是近於無聊的老手法。總之，這不是導演十分成功的作品。</p>
<p>然而主角的表演却很值得誇獎，在滑稽劇中能夠不過火的誇張，能夠如此自然而合理，眞是不可多得。配角　人亦很適當。</p>
<p>我覺得這是一部很能令人感覺興趣的作品。</p>

<p>— 欣俯</p>
<p>日耳曼影片公司出品全班女演員聯合主演</p>
<p>「裴柏女士！她是怎樣的一個人呢？那姑娘爲什麼要迷戀她呢」？她心中暗想着，但是她又不願意去問那神氣活現的庶務員，就退出了「化裝室」，手扶着樓梯的欄杆，一步一步懶洋洋的走下去。恰巧裴柏女士和她面對面的走上來。裴柏看見曼尼拉那楚楚可憐的模樣，雖然是第一次見面，却卽不覺動了愛憐之心。等到曼尼拉走到跟到，就伸出手來，撫弄她的髪辮，向她的面孔端詳了一會，然後開口問道：「你呌什麼？你是新來的嗎」？曼尼拉一五一十的答覆了她，方才各自走開。</p>
<p>曼尼拉在失望中，陡然遇見了這位溫文柔雅的先生，他那快要死的心靈，又好像漸漸的復活了，裴柏向樓上走去，她還獨個子站在那裏，朝着她的後影看。忽然一位同學，拍着她的肩膀，輕輕的問她道：「你認識這位先生嗎？她是許多先生中最慈愛的一個，就是那全校學生一體崇拜的裴柏女士呀」！曼尼拉到現在才明白了。那制服上鷄心和字母，原來如此。於是她的悲哀，又好像化爲烏有，在她的面孔上，又漸漸的露出笑容來了。</p>
<p>在寄宿舍裏，坐着和立着許多可愛的小姑娘，有的做女紅；有的談笑；其中還有一位呌做愛爾絲的小姑娘，在她的衣櫉後面，貼着很多男子照片，這天給大家發現了，那不是一件新鮮有趣的新聞嗎？於是大家都聚攏來和她調笑着。在那邊，還有一個女生手拿着家信，高喊着說：「媽媽說她殺了一頭豬，爲甚麼不送火腿給我吃呢」！這句話又引出了一陣大笑聲。這時外面怱然發現了皮鞋，一個站在門邊的偵探，急忙向她的同學們。丟了一個眼色。大家知道是敎員駕到了，頓時寂靜起來。</p>
<p>再說廚房裏面呢，三五成羣的女廚師，在紛紛談論着。一位女僕很怱忙的跑進來說：學「生們在嚷着肚子餓了，快點吧！一個㕑師，放下了手上所拿的盆子，回過頭來說道：「餓嗎」？她們都是軍人的兒女，將來還得做軍人的母親；况且我們普魯士人是富有忍耐性的。難道連肚皮餓都忍不住嗎」？另一個說道：「半鎊的乳油，要分配給五十個女子，怎麼這許多姑娘，曾未口出怨言，這却是很奇怪的。我决把我的一份，讓給他們了」。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Troop Withdrawal Slow <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Japan Agrees Not to Subsidize Puppet Troops</p>
<p>Rail Tracks at All Stations on the Beining Railway Have Been Repaired</p>
<p>(Beiping) The rear units of the Japanese army have been moving supplies and heavy artillery to the rear for days, but the transfer has been slow due to continuous rain. The original plan for all wartime organizations and supplies was to end on the 16th. After deliberation, whether to cancel them all at that time will depend on the Japanese army's withdrawal situation. Regarding the disposal of puppet troops, the Japanese side hopes that we will reorganize them into security teams, but we disagree because the composition of the puppet troops is mixed. After several discussions, the Japanese side finally agreed not to subsidize the puppet troops anymore and to expand the police force as much as possible in the future to resolve the problem separately. However, this matter is complicated and must wait for Okamura to return to Changchun, ask for instructions from the Kwantung Army, and then reply to Ping with a telegram before we can decide on a solution.

<p>After Liu Guitang's rebel troops occupied Guyuan, they have prepared to move towards Zhangbei. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Unfavorable Atmosphere After the Amnesty Telegram Was Sent</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Zhangyuan said that after Feng's amnesty telegram was sent, all parties were extremely calm. Chen Jitang's telegram from the east expressed opposition, which was very disappointing. Song, Pang, and others have all tried their best to distance themselves, and Song's troops have been gradually demobilized. Sun Dianying is also not being used by Feng. Moreover, the Chahar Province is extremely poor, with a monthly income of only 250,000, making it difficult to sustain. It is said that the Central Government plans to peacefully persuade Feng. Although Guan Linzheng's division is deployed in the Juyongguan area, there is no intention to advance. Feng may take the opportunity to temporarily withdraw. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>All Circles Warmly Welcome Ma and Others to Meet Wang Today</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, and their entourage arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai at 3:10 p.m. on the afternoon of the 6th and reached Xiaguan Station at 10:15 p.m. Thousands of people from various agencies, party departments, schools, and mass organizations in the capital went to the station to welcome them. Chairman Lin of the National Government sent his adjutant Tang Zhi, and President Wang sent Chu Minyi as representatives to welcome them. When the train arrived at the station, music was played, and all the welcomers clapped and chanted slogans. Representatives of Lin and Wang, as well as Garrison Commander Gu Zhenglun and Central Committee member Wang Qi, boarded the train, shook hands with Ma and Su to greet them, and expressed their condolences in person. Then they got off the train together. Amidst the cheers of the crowd, Ma and Su repeatedly said thank you. The enthusiasm of the atmosphere and the tension of the air were unprecedented. After Ma and others left the platform, they took cars directly to the Lizhi Society to rest. They are scheduled to pay their respects to the mausoleum at 7:00 a.m. on the 7th, meet Wang at 3:00 p.m., and Wang will host a banquet at the Lizhi Society at 7:00 p.m. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma and Su made the following brief remarks to reporters at the Lizhi Society: (1) This trip to Nanjing is to report to the central government on the anti-Japanese war. They will meet the chairman and the presidents of various courts and ministries tomorrow. The date of departure from Nanjing has not yet been determined. (2) The date to go to Jiangxi to meet Chiang has not yet been determined. (3) The four eastern provinces have been occupied by Japan. Until they are restored, we will adhere to our original intention and strive to recover the lost territories. In the past, due to inconvenient communication with the central government, we fought the Japanese in accordance with the duties of a soldier. In the future, we will work under the guidance of the government and obey government orders. (4) After passing through Europe this time, I felt that the scientific progress of various countries after the war has been rapid, with a very good impression, but the economy is more difficult. (5) In addition to those lurking in Heilongjiang, our troops have more than 20,000 in Chahar Province and thousands in Xinjiang. Now the hearts of the people in the Northeast have not died, and they are all determined to resist Japan. However, they feel that their strength is somewhat scattered. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e19">Zhu Jiqing Talks About the Recent Situation of the Volunteer Army Outside the Customs <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Jiqing said that the volunteer army outside the customs is entirely a self-defense organization of the local people. According to statistics from last autumn, there are about 300,000 people, mostly farmers. Whenever there is an opportunity, they desperately fight with the puppet troops. In the past few months, because the Japanese and puppet troops had to deal with the wars in Rehe and the Great Wall line, the internal defense was empty, and the volunteer armies in various places rose up for a while. Now that China and Japan have temporarily ceased fighting, the Japanese army will have more power to deal with the volunteer army, so the future of the volunteer army is indeed dangerous. However, according to my own observation, this kind of anti-Japanese potential cannot be eliminated no matter what. Although the Japanese army is violent, it will never be able to eliminate the volunteer army. After I arrived in Nanjing, I reported everything to Wang. Now that Pan Yunchao is sick in Shanghai, I plan to go to comfort him in the next few days. Whether to go to Jiangxi to meet Chiang and when to return north have not been determined. As for the North China armistice agreement, it is limited to military affairs and does not involve politics. It cannot be said that the government has abandoned the Northeast, so the people should unite in sympathizing with the government, endure hardships, and vow to avenge the country. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to financial circles, Song Ziwen established a US$50 million loan for goods with the Construction Finance Corporation in the United States. The gist of the contract has been reported to the central government by telegram. It is expected that the first batch of cotton and wheat will arrive in Shanghai next month. The government will authorize the National Economic Council to handle the storage and transportation of these goods. The issue of the allocation of the entire usage and the repayment of principal and interest will be managed by a separate supreme committee.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the memorandum submitted by the US government to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the American public and private debts owed by China, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs convened representatives from the four departments of Finance, Railways, Transportation, and Industry to discuss countermeasures. It was believed that these debts should be reorganized, but no concrete decision has been made.

The Executive Yuan considers this matter to be important and will forward it to the Central Government for review after discussion. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The move to lend to China to purchase cotton and wheat has today spurred various agricultural agencies in the United States to take action to reduce surpluses and increase prices for the next harvest. The White House said that the US president is deeply concerned that the benefits of lending to China will still be offset by overproduction. He specially summoned Secretary of Agriculture Wallace and members of Congress from the southern states to hold a two-hour cotton conference to discuss methods of reducing production. The Treasurer of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation also reported to the President that lending to China, coupled with the recent rise in cotton prices, will greatly stimulate the purchasing power of the people in the South. Senator Peng Haide reported to the President that in order to maintain the current price of cotton, the 1933 harvest must be reduced by at least 25%. Therefore, everyone at the meeting discussed plans to persuade cotton planters to reduce sowing. According to reports received by the Secretary of Agriculture, 40 million acres have been sown with cotton. Although the harvest may not all be of high quality, the total amount may not be greatly reduced from before. As for the US government's plan to raise cotton prices, it will not cause a rapid surge in the cotton market, and it will also have little impact on China's purchase of cotton, because there are still many cotton surpluses, which is enough to prevent prices from soaring. However, according to the Secretary of Agriculture, China's purchase of wheat will lead the United States to use its old goods to meet daily needs, because according to the Ministry of Agriculture's estimates, this year's wheat harvest will be 600 million bushels, the smallest harvest in 37 years. Americans need about 525 million bushels of food and 75 million bushels of seeds annually. It is estimated that this year's harvest is only enough for these two items. Exports and livestock feed are not included. Moreover, according to the Ministry of Agriculture's investigation, Russia's harvest may not be able to meet domestic needs either. Therefore, it is expected that the huge surplus may be sold out within a year. China's borrowing has today also prompted American rice growers to ask the Secretary of Agriculture for assistance in promoting sales to China or other rice-eating countries, in order to reduce the surplus.

<h3 id="e32">The Issue of Borrowing Funds to Purchase American Wheat · Zǐ <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper carried a Washington dispatch stating that Finance Minister Song Ziwen had borrowed 50 million US dollars from the American Reconstruction Finance Corporation. An agreement has been signed. According to the agreement, four-fifths of the loan will be used to purchase cotton in the United States, and one-fifth will be used to purchase American wheat and flour. A Nanjing dispatch stated the Ministry of Finance's explanation on the matter, saying, "This move is beneficial to both the American and Chinese people." and "The government can also provide cotton and wheat loans to the inland markets to alleviate cotton and wheat shortages, which will be of great benefit." Fifty million US dollars is equivalent to about 200 million yuan in national currency. Such a large amount of foreign debt increases the burden on the people, which cannot be said to be small. However, the Ministry of Finance's explanation was presented in a light and breezy manner. It is supposed that borrowing foreign debt is a fundamental plan related to finance and should be the responsibility of the highest administrative organ. Is the Ministry's explanation a kind of irresponsible, impromptu response? Before the highest administrative organ formally announces the details of this matter to the people of the country, we cannot obtain a formal basis for discussing this major borrowing event itself. What can be said is only the matter of purchasing American cotton and wheat with a huge amount of foreign debt. Regarding the cotton purchase, we will find statistical data separately for detailed discussion. Now, let's talk about the purchase of American wheat.</p>
<p>Summarizing foreign dispatches and the Ministry of Finance's explanation, one-fifth of the loan, which is 10 million US dollars, equivalent to about 40 million yuan in national currency, should be used to purchase American wheat and flour. This amount is similar to the loan for purchasing American wheat in the autumn of 1931. The wheat and flour that can be purchased should also be similar to the 450,000 tons purchased last time. According to the report of the National Government's Relief for Flood Victims Committee, transporting the American wheat purchased last time to northern Anhui and Hunan and Hubei Provinces was hindered by transportation difficulties. It was necessary to sell part of it at the ports and purchase grain in the inland areas with the proceeds. Today, due to last year's bumper harvest, the ports and areas with convenient transportation along the Yangtze River not only do not need foreign grain, but also, since last autumn, have suffered from the impact of the price reduction and dumping of foreign grain, resulting in a phenomenon of cheap grain hurting farmers. There is deep fear about the arrival of this large batch of foreign grain. Two years have passed, and the demand and interests have fundamentally reversed. In the past, the Yangtze River basin was a disaster-stricken area waiting for relief. Now, it is suffering from the difficulty of selling surplus grain.</p>
<p>Today, the area in the country waiting for relief is Shaanxi. According to investigations, there are more than 3.3 million famine victims in Shaanxi today. It seems that there is no shortage of using more than 400,000 tons of American wheat and flour to provide relief. However, in terms of transportation, it was inconvenient to transport to northern Anhui and Hunan and Hubei last time. Now, if we want to transport it to Shaanxi, where transportation has always been difficult, it will be even more difficult and we will have to sell the flour and wheat at the ports to use the proceeds as relief funds. The farmers at the ports have already suffered from the dumping of foreign grain. After the bumper harvest and famine year, how can they bear this? Moreover, last time, the Relief for Flood Victims Committee used the proceeds from the sale to purchase grain in the inland areas and had the experience of "supply falling short of demand, prices rising, and difficulty in exchanging grain." Today, the area near Shaanxi, which is called the inland area, has not much more grain storage than two years ago. This difficulty still exists. After these two twists and turns, how much benefit can the Shaanxi people receive? This is also a question.</p>
<p>We are not against the government raising huge funds to provide disaster relief to the people. However, the practical problems have to be considered. If a part of this loan is in cash, and is used to purchase surplus grain in bumper harvest areas, and the transportation routes are cleared with political power to reach the disaster-stricken areas, it would be a win-win situation. As the foreign dispatch in yesterday's newspaper stated, what is eliminated is the surplus wheat of the United States. China borrows this huge sum, and the harm is seen before the benefit. This is what the authorities should know. However, is the motive of this loan really as we speculate? Or does the authorities have other intentions? Then we dare not say.</p>

<p>Song Ziwen Arrives in London with Yan and Gu, Receives a Welcome</p>
<p>France Decides to Have the Prime Minister Serve as the Chief Representative</p>
<p>(London) Song Ziwen, Deputy President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China, together with Yan Huiqing, Chinese Ambassador to Russia, Gu Weijun, Chinese Minister to France, and the Chinese delegation to the World Economic Conference, arrived here tonight. When the ship arrived at the Sassoon Dock, Guo Taiqi, Chinese Minister to the UK, and Yang Guangsen, Chinese Consul General in London, went to greet them. When they arrived at Waterloo Station in London, Ronald, an official from the Foreign Office representing Foreign Minister Simon, and representatives from the Chinese community in London came to welcome them. Song Ziwen refused to issue a declaration at the World Economic Conference. Among those who came to England on the "Europa" with Song Ziwen were representatives from Argentina, Ecuador, and Japan to the World Economic Conference. The Polish representatives also boarded the Europa at Cherbourg, France, to go to London. The US delegation to the International Labor Conference landed at Cherbourg and transferred to Paris. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Song Ziwen visited Oxford today and will probably stay there overnight. Because Song Ziwen entered Lawton on the way, he has not yet started formal consultations with the British authorities, nor has he set a date to visit the Foreign Office. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) The British newspapers have praised Song Ziwen a lot. For example, the News Chronicle published an article by Green (former chief writer of the North China Daily News) saying that Song's arrival in England is a sign of the amazing changes that have taken place in China in the past year. It is expected that after private talks with the British government, there will be great results. China now needs the world's deeper attention, and Britain's interests in China are greater than any other country. Song is a man of high character, outstanding reputation, capable and approachable, and works fourteen hours a day. He is truly one of the most pleasant people to associate with. It is also said that among the governments of the world, there are no two people more talented than Chiang Kai-shek and Song Ziwen. Thirteen months ago, the Nanjing National Government announced that it would no longer engage in civil war. Today, the clear fact is that Nanjing has made a good start on a practical and feasible path. However, at this time, it needs help from others, and Britain can provide assistance. Upgrading the minister to an ambassador is the first step towards adopting a government strategy of constructive support based on the actual situation in the Far East. This move is valuable to both China and our England. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It has now been decided that Prime Minister Daladier will personally lead the French delegation to the World Economic Conference. He will soon entrust all matters to Finance Minister Bonnet and Keller, who has served as French Prime Minister and Finance Minister many times. According to several sources, it was originally planned to appoint Keller as the chief representative, but now Daladier has been replaced because the Prime Minister is determined to make France's security match disarmament. Therefore, even if the Four-Power Pact, which relies on a turning point in disarmament, is concluded after the opening of the World Economic Conference, it will not be surprising.

It is reported that as soon as Schacht returns to Beijing, Germany will discuss whether to adopt a cash payment suspension plan before the opening of the World Economic Conference, or whether the Deutsche Bank and the cabinet should submit a temporary plan and continue to expand it during the World Economic Conference. Several German newspapers have commented on the future of the World Economic Conference.

<p>Basel If the London World Economic Conference seeks the opinion of the International Bank for International Settlements on stabilizing currency, it is expected that the bank will recommend an improved gold standard system, but it is completely different from the gold standard system that several major countries have been forced to abandon. According to the bank's board of directors, it had prepared a plan to submit to the London conference. Later, because most of the recommendations in it would be adopted by other people's plans, the board of directors decided today not to submit it. If the Economic Conference seeks opinions, it will send representatives to London to present them in person. As for the bank's opinion on currency, the board of directors' report last year stated that the gold standard is still the best of the existing currency systems. If it wants to restore normalcy, the first step is to restore the gold standard. However, since the United States abandoned the gold standard, this statement must be revised. It is said that the bank's key people now believe that the gold standard's failure to meet the needs of the economic world is due to a lack of control. These people fully agree with the former President Mack Harrah's statement that it is futile to rashly restore the gold standard without remedying its shortcomings. As for the chaotic situation in which the gold standard has occurred today without control, according to Mack Harrah, it is caused by shortsighted egoism. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>Accuses Feng as a Japanese Agent</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Communist Party's organ newspaper, Pravda, published an article today involving the situation in North China, saying that General Feng Yuxiang, the Christian General, is actually a Japanese agent, and the Anfu clique is a medium for the Japanese to establish a puppet government in Peiping. The newspaper declared that Japan's advance into North China has been temporarily suspended in the disastrous defeat of the Chinese army. The newspaper has reported that the Japanese army's advance often goes hand in hand with the activities of Chinese pro-Japanese warlords. "The most obvious is General Feng Yuxiang, a Japanese agent. He has now restored his alliance with several soldiers. His strength is now about 100,000 people. On the one hand, Japanese imperialism is using Feng Yuxiang to make trouble for the Nanjing government, and on the other hand, it is fully preparing to establish a puppet government in Peiping through the medium of the Anfu clique." The newspaper concluded that the Japanese occupation of North China will inevitably deepen the conflicts between the imperialist countries and will further strengthen the US-Japan rivalry in the Pacific.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways believes that the gasoline used by cars on highways throughout the country is entirely purchased from overseas. Not only is the right to profit flowing overseas and leakage is increasing day by day, but the lifeline of transportation is also in the hands of others. If there is an emergency between countries, the source of gasoline will be cut off, and the effectiveness of highways will not only be lost immediately, but also help the enemy.

<p>Signed a Treaty with the Netherlands to Protect Far East Territories</p>
<p>(London) The Executive Committee of the Cotton Industry Association today wrote to Minister of Commerce Ren Ximan about Japanese competition, saying that if Japan delays sending representatives to discuss the matter, the British government should issue a formal notice to abolish the treaty, and at the same time try to implement preferential taxes or import quotas in the markets throughout the empire to restrict imports. If the Anglo-Japanese talks reach a level where the above-mentioned measures are permissible to reconsider, then the negotiations should be revised. If the talks break down, the British government should sign a treaty with the Netherlands to protect the British and Dutch colonies in the Far East in order to resist unfair competition from the Japanese cotton industry. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese officialdom is now maintaining a policy of observing the situation with a calm mind regarding the clamor in the UK. The Japanese officialdom pointed out that this clamor was initiated by the British cotton industry, with the aim of abolishing the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty and making the British colonies not subject to the existing commercial treaty. The Japanese officialdom is convinced that the British government will not tolerate this clamor, because the World Economic Conference is about to open and trade talks will be held between the British and Japanese representatives. However, the Japanese business community is quite indignant that there is an anti-Japanese movement in the UK. Some business leaders advocate retaliatory plans. They acknowledge that the competition between the two countries is very fierce, but point out that British industry and commerce hold a selfish attitude and that Japan's trade with the British Empire is actually beneficial to the UK. Japan's trade with the UK has been in a state of deficit in recent years, totaling 100,000,000 Japanese yen in 1930, 96,000,000 yen in 1931, and 34,000,000 yen in 1932. Japan's trade with some British colonies has occasionally been in surplus. It has been found that these colonies are transshipment ports for Japanese goods. Japan's trade with other parts of the British Empire has always been in deficit except for last year. Last year, Japan's trade with India did gain a slight advantage, but this was a first in 27 years. It has been found that the total deficit in Japan's trade with India in these 27 years reached 3,350,000,000 yuan. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Decided to Protest Again Against the New Tax Rate</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government instructed the Consul General in Nanjing on May 31 to protest against the Chinese government's implementation of the new tax rate. According to a report received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 5th from the Consul General in Nanjing, the Customs Department of the Chinese Ministry of Finance stated on the 4th that the Chinese government has no intention of changing the tax rate that has been implemented. Because the Chinese government did not consider the Japanese government's protest, the Asian Trade and Commerce Bureaus held a meeting on the 5th to discuss countermeasures and decided to protest to the Chinese government again. An emergency order has been issued to Japanese Minister to China Akira Ariyoshi. (Japan United News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e51">Russian Side Claims That a Secret Treaty Has Been Concluded Between China and Japan <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo Issues a Denial</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from Riga, Moscow announced that Japan has concluded a secret treaty with Nanjing. The treaty recognizes "Manchukuo" with boundaries approximately the same as today. Japan has also obtained certain privileges in Chinese waters. As for what China has obtained, it has not been mentioned. Political circles here are now denying that any secret treaty has been signed between China and Japan. Although this secret treaty cannot be initially confirmed, people here generally believe that the Tanggu Truce Agreement at least has a tacit understanding regarding "Manchukuo." It is because the Chinese side agreed to withdraw its troops south to a certain line, and the Japanese side also agreed to withdraw its troops from the Great Wall, which implies that China no longer intends to recover the land that is now within the borders of "Manchukuo." It was then claimed by political circles that the compromise between China and Japan was purely of a military nature regarding the cessation of hostilities. The details of this matter are still under discussion. What is compromised now is only a general outline. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>[P Japan Abhors US-Russian Closeness&gt;</p>
<p>Believes It Hinders Continental Policy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to diplomatic sources, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is very dissatisfied with the US-Russian closeness. Recently, it was heard that the US and Russia will use barter trade to revitalize trade between the two countries. The US exports its surplus agricultural products and livestock, and imports Russian metals, anthracite, and furs. It seeks political closeness through economic closeness. The Japanese government believes that the friendship between the US and Russia hinders Japan's continental policy and has ordered Ambassador Idebuchi to study methods locally to destroy the US-Russian friendship.

<p>Unite All Nations to Maintain World Peace</p>
<p>The International League of Nations World Federation Conference was held here in Montreux today. The chairman was Cecil. Swiss representative Motta gave a speech, pointing out the various weaknesses of the League of Nations and saying that the League of Nations' failure to operate effectively was due to the inability of major countries to agree on opinions. Cecil said that the world situation has greatly improved in recent days. The German Chief Representative, Mr. Shiney who was also a member of the Lytton Investigation Team, made a very brief statement on Germany's diplomatic policy. He said that Germany is now aware and that German Chancellor Hitler's speech in Congress on May 17 also expressed his willingness to treat all countries in the world with equality and achieve mutual understanding. Shiney's speech was very long and moved representatives from all countries. Cecil immediately declared that the people of a country have the sacred right to choose their own political system, and his personal only ambition is to unite all nations to maintain world peace, but if this goal is to be achieved, Germany's cooperation is indispensable. Later, the International Labor Organization Committee passed a resolution involving cooperation with the League of Nations Labor Bureau, and condemned labor recruitment and drug trafficking, and the Political and Legal Committee passed a resolution on the Far East incident, condemning Japanese aggression.

<p>Purpose is to extend the period of inflation</p>
<p>Government bonds have double protection</p>
<p>▲ National News, Washington, 5th. The US President signed the bill to abolish the gold standard today. This move will extend the period of inflation based on the current foundation, as the gold standard will not be restored until after Congress reconvenes at the earliest next year. During this period, the federal government will benefit the most, as it is the largest debtor, owing a total of $21,441,209,177 in public debt. In the future, it can enjoy the benefits of reduced burdens, just like farmers and homeowners who mortgage their property for loans. In addition, state and local governments across the country, which owe $100 million, will also enjoy the same benefits. According to inflation, the market price of public bonds will usually fall. However, this inflationary plan has two protections for government bonds: one is to authorize the Federal Reserve Bank to acquire 300 million yuan of government bonds, and the other is to authorize the President to issue 300 million yuan of national currency to acquire government bonds.</p>

<p>New York to Moscow in 28 and a half hours</p>
<p>Created a new record for non-stop flight</p>
<p>▲ National News, Moscow, 6th. American aviator Barton Teng rested briefly here and departed again at 1:30 AM in the moonlight, heading for Omsk in Siberia. He is expected to arrive in seven or eight hours. According to weather forecasts, there will be strong headwinds and rain along the way, with occasional heavy fog, but the weather east of Omsk should improve. Marten stayed in Moscow for less than ten hours, most of which was spent inspecting the plane. A large piece of flannel was found in an oil injector in the engine, which had fallen off the oil filter and caused an obstacle when injected into the cylinder. Marten told people that after finding this piece of flannel, it might have saved his life. Further news: Patton Teng flew over Kazan three hours after departure. His plane flew quite high, and the estimated speed was 125 miles per hour.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Moscow, 5th. American aviator Marten, who hopes to break the record for flying around the world in less than eight and a half days, arrived here at 2:05 PM today. It took him 28 hours and 45 minutes since leaving New York, exceeding the previous record of Post and Garty by three hours. When Marten flew across the Atlantic, he encountered bad weather, which prevented him from advancing according to his planned route. At 10:10 AM on Sunday morning, he made his first landing on the island of Joffrolin in southern Norway. He initially thought he had landed on the coast of Scotland, not knowing it was an island in southern Norway. The lighthouse keeper on the island reported Marten's arrival to the Norwegian capital, but the report was delayed for a long time before reaching Oslo. Since his departure, Marten had not eaten anything except oranges, so he was extremely exhausted after arriving on the island. He repaired the plane slightly, then went to bed for some time, and then flew from Joffrolin Island to the Taina military airfield, 15 miles from Oslo. After resting briefly in Oslo, he continued his journey and reached Moscow. He will now go to Irkutsk from here. Marten's plane is covered with the names of women from Joffrolin Island on both wings, as an expression of admiration for Marten's courage.</p>
<p>Another telegram: Marten felt very tired but very happy when he arrived here. He will sleep for a few hours and take a bath before going to Siberia. People in the Soviet aviation industry welcomed him warmly. The weather is not very good now, but Marten expects to fly at least 1,700 miles before landing. It took Marten seven hours and fifteen minutes to fly from the Taina airfield in Oslo to here. People in the Soviet aviation industry had been waiting for a long time. When Marten landed, they rushed forward to welcome him, helped him out of the plane, and put him in a Russian plane to take him into the air as a sign of respect. Marten said that he felt very good. The reason he landed in Norway was to melt the ice on the wings and to rest a little. Marten flew 4,000 miles from New York to Joffrolin Island, which is a new world record for non-stop solo flight. Marten said that he flew completely unconsciously over Ireland and England and did not see any ships when he crossed the Atlantic.</p>
<p>▲ Tass, Moscow, 6th. American aviator Marten, who plans to make a round-the-world flight, continued to fly to Pavlovaksk at 1:14 this morning after resting for nine hours at the Moscow airfield. He must pass through Sverdlovsk, Novosbirsk, Irkutsk and other places. The total distance from Moscow to Pavlovaksk is 6,950 kilometers.</p>

<p>President Opposes Amendment</p>
<p>Senate Postpones Vote</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Washington, 5th. The bill authorizing the President to prohibit the transport of arms to belligerent countries is unlikely to be definitively put to a vote in the Senate before it convenes in January next year. Last week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee amended the bill passed by the House of Representatives, deciding that the method of prohibiting arms exports should be applied to all belligerent countries, without making any distinction between aggressor and attacked countries. If this amendment is passed, the promises made by Roosevelt during the Washington talks and the declarations made by the US representative Davis in Geneva will lose their practical value. The establishment of this amendment is due to the resolute demands of the "isolation policy" faction. Roosevelt, upon hearing of this case, immediately declared his opposition and said that he hoped to discuss the matter again soon. However, judging from the Senate's psychology, it may not be easy to withdraw this amendment. The government seems to be aware of this, so the authorities seem to intend to delay the matter slightly, so that the Senate can change its psychology.</p>

<p>▲ Havas, Rome, 6th. German Ambassador to Rome, Hassel, is awaiting government orders to initial the Four-Power Pact. However, how the German government will decide is not yet known, as Prime Minister Hitler will only return to Berlin tonight. If the German government's affirmative response arrives in time, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will report to the Senate.</p>

<p>▲ Tass, Paris, 5th. An international anti-fascist conference was held here yesterday, with the participation of more than 3,000 representatives, presided over by Labor League Secretary Lassamon. Those who participated in the conference included various united fronts, unemployed people's groups, anti-imperialist alliances, Women's International League for Peace, trade unions from various countries, socialist organizations, labor intellectual groups, etc. In short, all were people who hated Fascistism and were prepared to fight against it. The presidium of the conference included German Communist Party's Thalmann and Tolkula, Bulgaria's Dimitrov, French Parliament's Communist Party representative Garsin, and French writer Jidette. At the meeting, reports were made on the Fascist movements in Germany, Poland, and Italy. The conference plans to issue a declaration to workers around the world and make a resolution on the impending imperialist war.

At the meeting, on the proposal of the chairman, it was resolved to first send a delegation to deliver the conference's protest against the death sentences of six German workers in Altona and Chemnitz to the German Embassy. French writer Barbisse, in the name of the International Anti-Imperialist War Committee organized in Amsterdam in August last year, applied to the conference to link the anti-fascist struggle and the anti-imperialist war struggle together under the slogan of "a united front for the mass struggle to ensure the victory of the proletariat."</p>

<p>Araki Encourages Saito to Move Forward Actively</p>
<p>Political Friends Association's Internal Strife Leads to Split</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo News. The position of the Saito Cabinet has recently been stabilized by the absolute support of the military. Recently, Army Minister Araki met with Prime Minister Saito. Araki expressed the military's strong opinions, encouraging Saito to move forward according to the fundamental mission of the current cabinet, and not to be discouraged by the severance movement of the Political Friends Association.</p>
<p>Further news: At a time when the attitude of the Political Friends Association towards the government is hardening, Army Minister Araki encouraged Prime Minister Saito by saying, "The hardness or softness of the parties can be ignored, but the cabinet should be quickly hardened and concretized in order to actively cope with the emergency." Araki's clear expression is expected to give the political world an emotional shock and cause a major wave. However, for the current cabinet, it is a very powerful stimulant. The current cabinet has now suddenly come to life. Prime Minister Saito has decided to change his previous wait-and-see attitude and move towards the concretization of new policies. The content of his new policies is (1) Cooperation with "Manchukuo", (2) Proper handling of Sino-Russian relations, (3) Diplomatic renewal after leaving the League, (4) Coordination of the London Economic Conference, (5) Rectifying the current situation, (6) Ideological countermeasures, (7) Innovation in education, (8) Establishment of finance, (9) Reform of administration, (10) Control of various industries, (11) Reform of the election law, (12) Purification of the political world (World News Agency)</p>
<p>▲ Hualian News, Tokyo, 6th. The internal strife of the Japanese Political Friends Association has become more intense since President Suzuki went to Kansai. The radicals held a meeting at the Kawauchiya in Tsukiji at 8:00 PM yesterday to discuss the unity of the various systems in the radical faction and decided to hold a meeting of interested Diet members at the Tokyo Hall at 4:00 PM on the 7th. While expanding its influence, it also issued a statement to the self-respect faction, declaring war. The drafting of the statement has been entrusted to Okada Tadahiko and Sunada Shigemasa. The self-respect faction also scheduled a meeting at the Sanyuan Pavilion at 6:00 PM on the 8th to decide on countermeasures. It is heard that the radicals will send representatives to the self-respect faction's meeting to engage in a verbal battle, which may cause a major emotional conflict and lead to a split in the Political Friends Association. Hatoyama Ichiro, Maeda Yonezo, and Ando Masazumi are deeply worried about the future of the Political Friends Association and want to contact powerful figures in the party to dissuade internal strife. It is heard that the self-respect faction will agree, but the radicals insist on not giving in. President Suzuki has decided to explain the true meaning of the Political Friends Association to the elder Saionji on the 10th of this month and then return to Beijing. The internal strife of the Political Friends Association has reached a final crisis.</p>
<h3 id="e85">PUBLIC TELEGRAM <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>To the Newspaper Offices of Peiping: I, the undersigned, established this office in Zhangjiakou last year under the order of the Ministry of Military Administration, and have since supplemented several thousand horses for various troops, organs, schools, and armies. As the national crisis is increasingly urgent, we are actively purchasing and replenishing. However, Feng Yuxiang, who is entrenched in Zhangjiakou, harbors disloyal intentions and is implementing a policy of separation in the name of resisting Japan. On May 26, he used lightning-fast methods to secretly dispatch armed troops to simultaneously surround and search the Chahar Provincial Government and all its subordinate organs, arbitrarily arresting central administrative personnel. This office was particularly targeted and suffered the most. The following is a record of the whole incident. On this day, Feng sent one battalion and two companies of his 2nd Training Regiment, led by Company Commander Gan and Deputy Officer Ran, with more than 100 armed soldiers, riding to surround this office. Holding guns and live ammunition, they were more ferocious than bandits. They detained all the officers and soldiers in one room, claiming that they were acting on the order of Commander-in-Chief Feng to search this office on the pretext that it was buying horses, but was actually conducting secret work for the central government. They also said that according to the investigation, this office had 3,000 horses, 200,000 yuan in foreign currency, and dozens of guns, and interrogated each officer one by one, creating a dangerous situation and forcing them to hand over everything immediately. After repeated explanations, they were not believed. The company commander and others even checked the horse stables and forcibly took away all 94 horses and one foal that actually existed. They also demanded the key to the safe, and when they could not get it, they broke the safe with an iron hoe. They searched and took away all the cash on hand, more than 3,000 yuan, and 5,000 yuan stored in foreign currency at the Bank of Communications. They also confiscated four rifles and pistols each, and 800 rounds of ammunition. The remaining official seals, confidential telegrams, various documents, books, etc., as well as all public and private items, were all plundered. Not satisfied with this punishment, they also escorted all the officers and soldiers in the office to the battalion headquarters to demand money for horses and guns. Later, after various attempts to rescue them, they escaped safely to Peiping. Feng is a member of the National Government, and at a time when the national situation is precarious, he should be assisting the central government and working together to save the crisis. However, he is not doing this, but is colluding with bandits, occupying a territory, and privately appointing public officials, disrupting the administrative system. He claims to be resisting Japan, but he does not rise up at a time of war emergency. He uses the false name of recruiting soldiers, but implements it at a time when military affairs have just been settled. His conspiracy to cause chaos is now evident. I, Peng, have suffered this unexpected disaster and suffered great losses. I am especially afraid that before the violent Japanese are eliminated, civil war will break out first. Therefore, I am specially reporting the circumstances of his abnormal actions and the situation of this office's plight, hoping that you will investigate it. Bai Yupeng, Director of the Zhangjiakou Military Horse Replenishment Office of the Ministry of Military Administration, respectfully presents this report.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Japanese and Puppet Troops Begin Activities in Eastern Chahar · Reaches <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Cavalry in Dolon has been Ordered to Guard Against the Puppet Army's Advance Southward</p>
<p>Feng is Consolidating his Army and Preparing for War in Zhangjiakou, with Meetings Held Daily in Pingfang</p>
<p>A Special Dispatch from Beiping: After the signing of the armistice agreement by the Japanese, they shifted their focus to Chahar Province and paid close attention to Feng's assumption of the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. On the 2nd of this month, they ordered the Motegi Cavalry in Dolon to pay special attention to the traitor Liu Guitang's forces. It was already on the 31st that they invaded Guyuan from Dolon. The traitorous troops of Cui Xinwu and others have also begun to stir, and the situation in eastern Chahar is gradually becoming tense. Since taking office, Feng has spared no effort in consolidating his army and preparing for war. On one hand, he has expanded his guard, and on the other hand, he has incorporated miscellaneous troops and militia. Near Zhangjiakou, there are about 10,000 troops expanded from Feng's guard, as well as several thousand troops from Li Fuying's Jin army. In the Zhangbei area, in addition to the original garrison of Zhao Chengzhou's Jin army cavalry division, Zhang Lisheng's cavalry commander, also has arrived. Feng Zhanhai's volunteer army was reorganized by Feng into the Anti-Japanese Army, and Feng Zhanhai was appointed as the commander-in-chief, leading his troops to be stationed in the Baochang area. Feng's troops are stationed all the way from Zhangjiakou to Xuanhua. Fang Zhenwu's troops are stationed in Xuanhua, Dushikou, and other places, while Sun Dianying's troops are stationed in the area of ​​Chicheng, Yanqing, and Shacheng. According to current statistics, the various troops and militia in Chahar number no less than 200,000. If the Japanese army does invade Chahar, they will be sufficient to resist. However, the system is complex, and both supplies and equipment are lacking. It is difficult to say whether they can cope with a strong enemy. Pingfang has been convening military meetings for days to discuss and resolve the issues of puppet troops in the war zone and the transfer of our troops after the withdrawal of the Japanese army. The matter of Chahar is also being discussed in detail. The attitude toward Feng's actions has yet to be stated; however, tight defenses are being maintained around Juyongguan to prevent accidents. Today, a certain military organization in Pingfang received a telegram from Zhao Chengzhou reporting on the Chahar situation and requesting a transfer. The telegram stated that Feng (Yuxiang) has appointed cavalry division commanders Nie Yuling, Zhang Ziguang, Cao Fuchen, and army commander Zhang Lisheng, and 24th Division commander Fu Chun, and they are all now in Zhangbei, incorporating bandits and recruiting old troops. The number of troops near Zhangbei has reached several thousand, and they are living mixed in with my troops. If anything happens, combat will definitely be inconvenient. I intend to move my troops to the area west of Zhangbei. If the Japanese and puppet troops change course and invade southward, I will lead my troops to threaten the enemy's flanks and can easily coordinate with my Li (Fuying) army. Furthermore, according to people from Zhangjiakou, Feng Yuxiang is loudly advocating thorough resistance against Japan. He has been living in seclusion in Zhangjiakou, harboring the idea of ​​returning to the battlefield to try his hand again. He has been secretly making arrangements for more than a day, and there are many people contacting him from all sides. In late last month, Fang Zhenwu led his Zhang (Renjie) and Bao (Gang) armies, claiming to number 40,000 to 50,000, and marched directly into Xuanhua, disarming a large portion of He Sui's newly compiled 55th Army. The internal atmosphere in Chahar suddenly became very tense. At the same time, Feng Zhanhai led tens of thousands of volunteer soldiers to Zhangbei. The advance troops had already entered Zhangjiakou, demanding supplies along the way, causing panic among the people. Wealthy households moved to Wanquan one after another. At that time, the voice of "Sino-Japanese Compromise" was singing loudly, and Feng suddenly rose up and detained Feng Zhanhai, sending 2,000 of his guards to disarm all the volunteer soldiers throughout the night of the 25th of last month. That night, the sound of mobilization slogans filled the streets, startling the citizens and causing them to think that a great disaster was about to befall them. The next day, Feng himself went to the Chahar Provincial Government, convened a mass rally of the province, and announced his assumption of the position of Commander-in-Chief of the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army, appointing Tong Lin'ge as the Chairman of Chahar Province, Ji Hongchang and Zhang Lisheng as the Commander and Deputy Commander of the Guard Army, and detaining Zhang Jiuqing, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, and many others. All police firearms were confiscated and replaced with batons. By the 27th, the hearts of the people throughout the city suddenly turned calm. People thought it was strange. In recent days, Feng has focused his efforts on propaganda work. Every day, on the streets, groups of workers holding paper flags can be seen everywhere, shouting slogans in teams. The entrances of various businesses are full of two kinds of cloth banners with slogans such as "Down with the Traitorous Government," "Release All Political Prisoners," and "Abolish Exorbitant Taxes." The first type is made of cloth, mostly red silk, while the second type is made of white bamboo cloth. The latter may have been hung by the citizens. At this time, a notice from Feng Zhanhai, the Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Army, was suddenly posted on the streets. It is said that when Feng Zhanhai was detained, he expressed to Feng (Yuxiang) that "If my troops are disarmed or ordered to atone for their crimes by resisting Japan, I will obey the orders of the Commander-in-Chief." Therefore, Feng bestowed this position upon him. In recent days, troops in Zhangjiakou have been dispatched one after another. It is said that their defense line is deployed north of the Dajingkou area. Fang Zhenwu's two armies, one is transferred to the front line in eastern Chahar, and the other remains stationed in Xuanhua. However, according to Feng's propaganda, resisting Japan is one issue, and opposing the central government is another. It is difficult to figure out the order of priority. It is expected that other problems will not occur in the shortest period of time. As for the Ping-Sui Railway line, Feng's army has placed a platoon of infantry at Kangzhuang Station, specializing in inspecting passengers and goods on trains. The inspection of plainclothes passengers is very lenient, but it is very strict for soldiers. If armed soldiers do not have badges, they are detained according to Feng's orders. However, after some arguing, they are often released, so the train is often delayed. The military police sent by the central government to inspect are no longer to be seen. South of Qinglongqiao, troops from Pingfang are stationed along the way, and the responsibility for inspection lies with Pingfang. However, it is not as strict as it used to be. (June 4)</p>
<h3 id="e87">The Japanese Army in Shanhaiguan Begins to Withdraw (Reaches) <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Our Army will soon be Demobilized and Preparing to Take Over the War Zone</p>
<p>The Handling of Puppet Troops is Very Difficult and is Currently Under Negotiation</p>
<p>A Special Dispatch from Beiping: After the signing of the armistice agreement, both sides immediately began to implement it. The Japanese army began to withdraw yesterday (3rd), first withdrawing the field artillery and baggage, and the rest will be transferred one after another. Our army had already withdrawn to a considerable location and does not need to withdraw any further. However, now that the war has stopped, there is no need to station a large army in Tianjin, and all wartime establishments should also be abolished, restoring the establishment. All demobilization and transfer issues have been discussed in detail at military meetings in recent days. As soon as the Japanese army withdraws, it will be demobilized, and the issues of taking over the war zone and the disposal of puppet troops will be negotiated by the representatives of both sides at the Tanggu Conference after the signing. The day before yesterday, our representative, Xiong Bin, and others went to Tianjin to first discuss in detail with Yu Xuezhong, the Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, and then consulted with the Japanese representative. A general agreement was reached on the issue of taking over. Our side is now preparing everything. The first step is to establish a provincial capital police or security team of about 2,000 people to maintain local security in the war zone. In the future, they will be distributed to various counties to clear out bandits. Once local order is restored and the local police are established, the local security will be the responsibility of the local police. As for local administration, administrative personnel will still be appointed by the provincial government to take over. As for the puppet troops, the issue is complicated. Although the Japanese side has agreed to let our side handle it, it is limited by the agreement. We cannot send troops to suppress them, nor is it convenient to appease them. It is very difficult. No appropriate solution has yet been found. Yu Xuezhong, Xiong Bin, and others came to Beiping from Tianjin and discussed the matter in detail with the military and political authorities here. They plan to negotiate with the responsible Japanese personnel in Beiping again within the next few days. In recent days, the puppet troops have still been active everywhere. Shi Yousan is also very active in eastern Luan. The villages east of Lutai and Tongzhou have been greatly ravaged. The puppet troops' opportunistic activities are intended to take advantage of this opportunity to seek a settlement. The Japanese side still has a use for them and does not want to completely eliminate them. What will happen in the future still depends on the final efforts of the authorities. (June 4)</p>
<p>Traitors Repeatedly</p>
<h3 id="e88">Plotting to Harm Yu Xuezhong · Twin <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>(Former Regiment Commander Instigated by Others)</p>
<p>A Special Dispatch from Beiping: Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, has always been known for his strict military discipline and has spared no effort in maintaining public security. The general traitors have been seeking opportunities to take advantage of him, and therefore harbor deep resentment toward Yu. In addition, Yu has repeatedly stated that he will do his best to deal with the rioters and defend the national territory. Therefore, those who harbored hatred for Yu have taken further action to harm him. The news of Yu's assassination attempt a month ago was published in the newspapers, and people in Tianjin were shocked. Unexpectedly, one wave subsided, and another rose. In late last month, after the Tianjin Incident, someone actually plotted to harm Yu again. The treacherous schemes of the traitors are becoming more and more sinister. Initially, Yu had a former regimental commander, Qu, who retired due to old age and was recuperating in Tianjin. Yu thought of their old friendship and still sent him a private subsidy of 50 yuan per month to support him. Unexpectedly, Qu became blinded by greed and secretly contacted the main actors of this Tianjin Incident, such as a certain individual, and was ordered to assassinate Yu. His wolfish ambitions were not what was expected. Certain individuals were originally famous figures among the Northern Warlords, and before the completion of the Northern Expedition, they were once prominent. They have been retreating to the north for years, not forgetting their activities. Since the Japanese have organized the Manchurian puppet state in the northeast, they have been colluding with frustrated military and political figures in the North China area, secretly plotting to start an incident. For example, Shi Yousan, who fled to eastern Luan, is also one of the main figures in this. As the Tianjin Incident has repeatedly failed, they have strengthened their determination to harm Yu and have been secretly planning for almost a day. A certain individual instructed Qu on a certain day, promising him a large sum of money after the event was successful. On a certain day, Qu met Yu's servant in a certain concession and tried every means to lure him into the plot. At that time, Yu's servant did not know the truth, so he pretended to comply, asking about the assassination plan. Qu repeatedly asked for help, gave him two packets of poison, and attached 300 yuan, instructing him to poison Yu according to the plan, saying that after success, he would give him another 30,000 yuan as a reward. The servant took the original items and presented them to Yu, and told him the whole story. Yu then secretly inquired about it from his subordinates. Unexpectedly, similar incidents were found among Yu's cooks and servants. Afterwards, several people from a certain country went to the provincial government to inquire about Yu's daily life. Only then did they know that this matter had become a planned action, so they strengthened their defenses. On the 28th of last month, Yu went to the provincial government to work at about 6 a.m. Many traitors were waiting in a secluded alley, planning to assassinate him. They thought that Yu's time to go to the provincial government was about 7 a.m. every day. They went in time that day, but initially thought that Yu had not passed by yet, so they ate soy milk and fried dough sticks at small stalls along the road. Unexpectedly, Yu had already arrived at the government office by car earlier. The traitors were extremely frustrated, and Yu was able to escape the disaster, which was also considered fortunate. Yesterday, a guest came to Beiping from Tianjin and told reporters the truth of the matter. Because the details were convoluted, they were recorded in detail. (June 4)</p>

<p>(Six Years in an Instant Since the Huanggutun Incident)</p>
<p>What Does Zhang Xueliang Think in a Foreign Country?</p>
<p>A Special Dispatch from Beiping: June 4 is the tragic anniversary of the assassination of Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin by the enemy in Huanggutun. His son, Xueliang, is now far away in a foreign country. What does he think about it? Previously, after Zhang Zuolin's military defeat, he telegraphed his resignation on June 2 of the 16th year of the Republic and left Beijing for Fengtian on the 3rd. The security of Beijing was handed over to the Temporary Security Maintenance Committee composed of Wang Shizhen, Xiong Xiling, and others. On the 4th, Zhang's special train arrived at the intersection of the Beijing-Fengtian and South Manchurian Railways on the South Manchurian Railway. Suddenly, a bomb exploded, and the special train was blown to pieces. Zhang was seriously injured and died in Shenyang on the 9th. Wu Junsheng, the Governor of Heilongjiang, was also killed in the bombing. Wu was succeeded by Wan Fulin as the Governor of Heilongjiang, and Zhang Xueliang concurrently served as the Commander of the Northeast Border Defense. When the September 18th Incident occurred, Zhang Xueliang stated that he would definitely avenge the national and family hatred. Although he is now traveling overseas, it is thought that he must not forget the painful memories of that day. Before Zhang Zuolin was killed, he had a will, which spoke of promoting unification. The original text is rarely known to outsiders. Now, through a certain important person in the Northeast, the reporter has obtained the original text, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"I am unfortunately in danger on the way back, and my illness is now serious. I am afraid I will die soon. Since I joined the army as a child, I have sworn to serve the country with my life and put life and death aside. I am now fifty-four years old, and death is not ordained by heaven, but I cannot help but feel uneasy because my ambition to save the country has not been fulfilled. Now I entrust the important task of Fengtian to Xueliang, hoping that you will manage it well, recruit talented people, improve internal affairs, make the people live and work in peace, and comfort the longings of the elders. On the one hand, strive for peace to end the war and promote unification, do not go against my previous telegrams advocating peace, and I hope that my comrades will share this idea and follow my will, giving priority to the country and the people in everything, and working together. This will be enough to show the sincerity of love among all of you. Even if I die, I will rest in peace." (Jin)</p>

<p>The First Installment of Land Value Tax Collection Begins</p>
<p>After the amalgamation of the local Finance Bureau and the County, the collection of silver tax is handled by the second section of the county government, supervised by the Land Tax Director, Zhu Kaiguan. In order to strictly pursue arrears, County Magistrate Yan convened more than 400 village heads from the entire county twice, speaking earnestly about the first installment of land value tax for this year, deciding to start collection on July 1. The Land Tax Office instructed the clerks in the Yi and Gui districts to rush to prepare the registration booklets overnight. The booklet paper was printed and distributed by the county government. As soon as all the booklets are completed, they must be sent to the county for stamping. In recent days, farmers from the four villages have been coming to the city to pay land value tax to the county and collect licenses, which is very enthusiastic. At the same time, the Land Tax Office also instructed the collection officials in the seventeen cities and villages to go to the villages to strictly urge the large clans and wealthy households to quickly pay up to support the national treasury.</p>

<p>Cultivating the Unclaimed Coastal Land North of the Yangtze River</p>
<p>Last autumn, officials and merchants discussed jointly cultivating the barren coastal salt lands north of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province. A plan was drawn up, with a total cost of 10 million yuan, with officials and merchants each contributing 5 million. In April of this year, they began to proceed separately. Initially, it was proposed that the merchants would raise 25 million first, and the officials would allocate funds from the Finance Department. According to reliable information, the 5 million that the merchants should be responsible for has been negotiated with Rong Zongjing, and all the loans will be paid in three installments by the end of this year. The loan agreement will be signed in mid-month, so the funding can be temporarily resolved. As for the official 5 million, Finance Director Shu Shifu has also assured people that he is making every effort to raise funds. Currently, the first part of the project in the reclamation zone is to improve the soil quality and flush the saline-alkali land. Starting on the 1st of this month, 30,000 workers will be hired to excavate a new canal. This canal starts from Chenjiagang in Lianshui and ends at Jiaozhen in Nantong, so as to draw water from the Huai River into the canal, divert the flow for flushing, and it is limited to be completed within this year. In addition, 500 soil-turning machines have been ordered from Germany for digging up the sandy soil in the area. A batch has now been shipped.</p>

<p>Answering Visits from Leaders of All Sectors and Receiving Reporters Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan, the national hero and Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, and Su Bingwen, the Commander-in-Chief of the National Salvation Army, arrived in Shanghai by Italian mail ship at 10 p.m. the night before last and stayed at the Army Club on Jinxian Road, where they were warmly welcomed by various groups and the public. At 9 a.m. yesterday, the two visited leaders of various groups to express their thanks. At 11 a.m., they met with reporters from various newspapers at their residence, reiterating their commitment to resist Japan to the end without yielding.

<h3 id="e95">Receiving Guests <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>

<h3 id="e97">Receiving Reporters <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>At 11 a.m. yesterday, Generals Ma and Su received reporters from various newspapers at the Army Club on Jinxian Road, with more than 20 people present. At that time, the Lianhua Company also filmed a movie. After Ma said a few words of greeting, he first expressed his gratitude and apologized for not having time to talk in detail on the ship.</p>

<p>The reporter asked, "How many of Chairman Ma's old troops are still there and where are they currently stationed?" (Ma replied) "About 20,000, currently stationed in Chahar Province." (Asked) "Commander Deng of your troops is cooperating with Feng Huanzhang in resisting Japan. What are Chairman's opinions?" (Answered) "I have not received a telegram and do not know the details. However, resisting Japan is my long-cherished wish, and all those who can truly resist Japan are my friends and can cooperate." (Asked) "Feng Yuxiang's actions in Chahar seem to be inconsistent with the central government's political views. What is your opinion?" (Answered) "I have been away from the country for half a year, and the situation is not clear. I don't know the details." (Asked) "After Chairman goes to Beijing, do you intend to go to Chahar?" (Answered) "I intend to go to Chahar to inspect my old troops and implement the anti-Japanese proposition."</p>
<h3 id="e99">Thoughts on the Ceasefire <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>(Asked) "What are Chairman's thoughts on the signing of the North China Armistice Agreement?" (Answered) "When the North China Armistice Agreement was signed, I was on my way back to the country and did not know the content, so it is not convenient to express my opinion. My personal opinion is that for the sake of rectifying the military appearance, a temporary local ceasefire is not impossible. The public should also understand the government's difficulties, but it is absolutely impossible to compromise and surrender." (Asked) "When you return to the country and go to Beijing, will you make any contributions to the central government?" (Answered) "We have been fighting against Japan for years and know more about the situation of the Japanese army. Of course, we will report to the central government and advise on everything. As for the future policy, it will be determined according to the central government's policy. However, the people of the whole country are like this, and the central government will never compromise with Japan." At this point, General Su Bingwen spoke, saying that the ceasefire was definitely not the government's intention, but a temporary measure to cope with the situation. Compromising with Japan would violate the public opinion of the whole country. Even with our stupidity, we would not do this. How could the central leaders be so confused?</p>

<p>(Reporter asked) "What are General Ma's impressions of the Soviet Union's hospitality during this trip?" (Answered) "The Soviet Union treated us entirely as a neutral country. During our stay in the country, all our comings and goings were monitored everywhere, but in fact we were never subjected to any abuse." (Asked) "After traveling to the Soviet Union, General Ma also went to Germany. The political systems of these two countries are extremely opposite. What is the general's comparative observation?" (Answered) "Although the Soviet Union is nominally a socialist country, in reality, it still takes into account its national position everywhere. For example, foreign goods cannot be sold in its country at all. Its citizens would rather wear burlap sacks than spend money to buy foreign goods. As for Germany, although the domestic political situation is also very complicated, everything is still based on the country as the premise. Recently, Hitler's assumption of power has shown the new spirit of the nation everywhere. Meetings and parades are all lively. The most admirable thing is the German people's affection for the army, which is not like the fear of soldiers among our people. This is what we soldiers are extremely ashamed of."</p>

<p>(Reporter asked) "When General Ma met with Mr. Zhang Hanqing in Italy, did he talk about national affairs?" (Answered) "Mr. Zhang only told me that he was ill and was currently recuperating. He did not express anything about national affairs." Ma also said that when we were in Europe, people from various countries paid attention to our words and deeds, and expressed sympathy for our firm anti-Japanese proposition. When we passed through Hong Kong, we were deeply grateful for the enthusiastic welcome from representatives of various sectors and groups on the ship. Liu Luyin, representing the Southwest Political Committee, did not meet on the ship. Mr. Hu Qingtang sent his daughter, Mulan, to talk and invited us to go ashore to meet, but I also declined due to illness.</p>

<p>(Asked) "Generals Ma and Su, now that you have arrived in Shanghai, just as the Sino-Japanese peace treaty has been signed in North China, the people of Jiangnan hope that the anti-Japanese leaders who have fought bloody battles with the Japanese invaders can put forward some propositions. Are you prepared to make any announcements?" (General Su answered) "We Chinese soldiers only know how to obey government orders and are not convenient to make any propositions. Moreover, we have been away from the country for half a year, and all the changes are not known in detail." General Ma remained silent in his seat, politely telling the reporter that many situations were unclear during his time abroad, so it was difficult to express his opinion.</p>

<p>The reporter also asked, "How many of General Su's old troops are there?" (Su replied) "More than 3,000 people who returned to the country from Russia to Xinjiang, all empty-handed. Later, due to the rebellion in Xinjiang, it was heard that the new provincial government had issued some firearms. In addition, there is still a brigade that followed Chairman Ma's troops to garrison in Chahar, and has now been reorganized into a training regiment." (Asked) "Will General Su go to Xinjiang?" (Answered) "I have no intention of doing so." (Asked) "Will Generals Ma and Su go to Jiangxi to visit Chairman Chiang?" (Answered) "It will be decided after going to Beijing."</p>

Their stay in the capital will be for about five days, as they need to report to the central government and thank various circles in the capital. Whether or not they will go to Jiangxi will be decided after they return to Shanghai. It is said that General Ma seems to have a stomach ailment and is also tired from the journey. After completing his official duties, he will need to rest and recuperate in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Levying Anti-Dumping Duties</p>
<h3 id="e109">To Be Handled by Customs <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Tax Rate Based on Market Conditions</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, considering that the dumping of foreign goods affects the development of Chinese industries, intends to levy anti-dumping duties on foreign goods to protect domestic products and balance the prices of foreign goods. It will also establish an anti-dumping committee to conduct detailed investigations into all dumped goods to provide a basis for levying duties. It is learned that since the committee's investigation, the various dumped goods have been generally clarified. This time, the anti-dumping duty is levied to balance prices, so the tax must determine a tax rate, and is based on market conditions as the standard. If a certain product costs ten yuan for domestic goods, but only six yuan for foreign goods, a dumping tax of four yuan will be levied in the future. If the foreign goods are not available domestically and are being dumped among foreign merchants, then no additional dumping tax will be added. It is also heard that, for the sake of convenience, the collection of this tax will be entrusted to the Customs in the future, but the principles of collection will be determined by the review committee and notified to the Customs at any time. The actual implementation date has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Industrial Circles Approve</p>
<h3 id="e110">Loan to Purchase American Cotton and Wheat <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Says it will not affect our agricultural products</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, Finance Minister Song Ziwen signed a loan of 50 million US dollars in the United States, of which four-fifths will be used to purchase American cotton and one-fifth to purchase American wheat. This matter is of great importance to our economy and industry. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency specially visited yarn and flour mill manufacturers yesterday to inquire about their opinions. The results obtained were all in agreement. The interview is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Yarn Industry stated that, according to Hu Yunjie, director of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange, China's cotton production could be self-sufficient, but due to years of being bought up by the Japanese, raw materials have become increasingly scarce. Japanese yarn is being dumped on the market, while Chinese yarn is greatly affected due to the high cost of raw materials and the low price of yarn. In this difficult period, there is even more panic. Before leaving the country, Mr. Song had fully considered this matter, and the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry also made a decision to purchase American cotton on credit at the meeting to help yarn mills in Shanghai. This shows that the arrival of American cotton in China will not have much impact. However, the current price of American cotton is about 60 yuan in Chinese currency, while Chinese cotton is only about 46 yuan. Therefore, after shipping to China, it is hoped that the Ministry of Finance can sell it at 80% of the price, so that Chinese merchants can enthusiastically purchase it. Regarding the payment method, it would be especially desirable if payments could be made in installments. The government purchases this raw material on credit, and the debt must be cleared after three years, while merchants pay at most in two or three months. The government can immediately obtain a large sum of money, which is more cost-effective than issuing public bonds, even though the selling price has been discounted by 20%. Moreover, it can increase customs revenue. The yarn mills will convene a meeting in the near future to decide which companies will purchase the cotton. The import of American cotton will inevitably affect domestic products, but the maximum monthly import is only about 50,000 bales, so it will not have much impact.</p>
<p>The Flour Industry stated that, according to Rong Zongjing's associates, the production of wheat flour in China has been very low recently. Since the loss of the Northeast, raw materials have become even more scarce. The national production is only enough for the needs of two or three days for a few manufacturers. Therefore, flour mill manufacturers have to continuously purchase foreign wheat from the United States, Australia, and other places to maintain business and take care of the lives of workers. Therefore, Finance Minister Song's decision to purchase American wheat on credit will absolutely not have any impact on our country.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Japanese Ambassador Going to Capital This Morning <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>To Protest Our New Tax Rates</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that regarding the issue of Japanese merchants opposing our implementation of new tax rates, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an emergency instruction to Shanghai yesterday, ordering Japanese Ambassador to China, Akira Ariyoshi, to immediately lodge a protest with us and request that we redraft the tax rates. It is learned that Ariyoshi has decided to go to the capital this morning to handle this matter. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Japanese Ambassador Received Instructions)</p>
<p>After our country implemented new tax rates, the United Federation of Japanese Commercial Associations in this port convened a meeting of all Japanese merchant representatives in Shanghai at the Wengjianshi Road Club to discuss countermeasures. It was unanimously decided to send a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan to lodge a protest with us. After receiving the telegram, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately telegraphed the Consul-General stationed in Beijing to thoroughly investigate the new tax rates implemented by our country in order to prepare for the protest. It is learned that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an emergency instruction to Shanghai yesterday, ordering Japanese Ambassador to China, Akira Ariyoshi, to immediately lodge a verbal protest with our diplomatic authorities. At around 3:00 PM yesterday, Ariyoshi telegraphed to invite Consul Ishisa of the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai and representatives of various Japanese factories to a meeting to discuss the reasons for the protest. Hengzhu, the Japanese Commercial Counselor in China, did not return to Shanghai yet, so he specially sent a representative to attend the meeting. Because the Japanese side is strictly guarding secrets, it is difficult to find out the results.</p>
<p>(Decision to Go to Capital This Morning)</p>
<p>According to sources from the Japanese Consul-General, Ambassador Ariyoshi, together with his secretary and Chinese translator, etc., eight people in total, is scheduled to take the Beijing-Shanghai Express train at 9:25 this morning to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss certain diplomatic matters. However, it is still difficult to determine whether it is related to the issue of opposing the implementation of new tax rates. However, according to Japanese merchants, Ariyoshi's mission this time is to protest the implementation of these new tax rates to our diplomatic authorities. The minimum goal must be to achieve a revision. If the verbal protest is ineffective, the Japanese government will order the expulsion of all Chinese overseas in Japan as retaliation. The second step is to actively establish Japanese goods manufacturing factories in Shanghai to reduce the import tax payable on Japanese goods.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Thoughts on Returning from the Northwest <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>To Reclaim the Northeast</p>
<p>Northwest Must Be Developed</p>
<p>Ms. Lin Pengxia, China's first female aviator, was warmly welcomed when she inspected various provinces in Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Suiyuan, and Chahar. She returned to Shanghai from Tianjin the day before yesterday. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency specially visited her at her hotel to inquire about her experience and thoughts on the inspection of the Northwest. She agreed to meet, her face was quite thin, but she spoke eloquently. She said that her ancestral home is Putian, and after graduating from Shanghai Minli Girls' High School and Tianjin Girls' High School, she followed her father to Nanyang to do business, and then studied at Columbia University in the United States, where she obtained a Bachelor of Economics degree. She also went to England to study aviation piloting and served as the manager of a rubber plantation in Singapore. After the September 18th Incident and the loss of the Northeast, and seeing Japanese planes flying and bombing, and compatriots suffering, she felt that the Northwest must be developed urgently. Therefore, with a spirit of fearlessness, she went to the Northwest. She saw that the provinces had vast land and sparse population, with an average of less than a few people per mile, and the richness of the resources was far beyond our expectations. Taking coal as an example, it is everywhere. Metal and other minerals are also found everywhere, but unfortunately, they have not been mined. Culture is blocked due to traffic congestion. The locals regard my solo travels as a strange thing. The customs are honest and sincere. Smokers account for an average of 70-80%. The Shaanxi-Gansu area has suffered from drought for years, commerce is sluggish, and the economy is depressed. People mainly eat wheat flour. The disaster areas are vast and numerous. Last month, there was another wind disaster, and the wheat harvest is completely hopeless. The only relief at present is replanting. Chairman Shao's planning for remedies is extremely needed. The weak among the disaster-stricken people are reduced to ditches, and the strong become bandits. It is difficult to suppress or appease them. In short, I feel that if China wants to reclaim the Northeast, it should develop the Northwest. If it wants to develop the Northwest, it should help the Northwest, starting with investigations. This time, when I came to Shanghai, I planned to ask academic and economic groups to speed up their work, and seek sincere comrades to gather and study, and be the pioneers of actual development. The Ningxia Education Department sent me off when I returned south. It is said that yesterday, Ms. Lin also gave a lecture on developing the border and promoting culture at the invitation of Wuben Girls' High School and the Frontier Research Association of Shanghai University, which greatly moved the teachers and students. She was praised as a remarkable woman in China.</p>

<p>According to the "Great American Evening News," Major Doolittle, the American aviator, officially handed over the "Great Shanghai No. 1" airplane, which was purchased with public donations, to the Chinese government in Hangzhou. He returned to Shanghai this morning (6th). As all the matters he came to China for have been completed, he is scheduled to take the "Japan Post" via Europe back to his country tomorrow (7th). He will still serve as the aviation manager of Shell Oil Company. He plans to stay in Hong Kong for a short period of time.</p>

<p>According to the "Great American Evening News," Captain Balbo, a famous Finnish aviator, flew east from Helsinki, the capital of Finland, on May 11, planning to reach the United States, passing through Southern Europe, Asia Minor, and Southern Asia. He flew to Hong Kong yesterday and flew to Shanghai this morning, stopping briefly in Xiamen to refuel. It is expected that he will arrive in the afternoon today. Therefore, representatives of the Finnish community in this port gathered at the Hongqiao Airport in the afternoon, waiting for his arrival to welcome him. It is not yet decided how long Mr. Balbo will stay in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Departing for Philippines Today, Will Still Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the "Great American Evening News," Mr. Cooper, the general manager of the Associated Press of the United States, his wife, and his female secretary, Ms. Gibbs, arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese Empress ship this afternoon (6th). However, they will leave for Manila tomorrow and will stay in Shanghai for a short time when they return to the country. Mr. and Mrs. Harris, the agency's correspondents stationed in Shanghai, boarded the ship to greet them. However, Mr. Cooper immediately asked them not to plan any welcome events. He will spend the afternoon and evening sightseeing in the city and purchasing local products. Mr. Cooper's hurried trip is partly due to the limited time and partly because he had just finished convening the agency's annual meeting in New York before setting off. After traveling in Japan for two weeks, he felt quite tired. The agency has an important branch in Manila, which provides world news to local newspapers. In Shanghai, there are only correspondents who collect news but do not publish articles.</p>

<p>Feng Yuxiang Aims to Resist Japan</p>
<p>Japanese Rumors Are Increasingly Bizarre</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter visited someone in Shanghai close to Feng Yuxiang to inquire about Feng's situation. According to him, Feng organized the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army. The Japanese side is eager to eliminate and destroy it, but due to the facts, it is impossible to introduce it to the world. The actions of Feng reported in the newspapers recently, the most laughable is the report of a Japanese news agency that Feng has severed ties with the Kuomintang, banned the Qingbai flag, and plans to restore relations with Soviet Russia. It is purely fabricated, trying to incite civil war, which is absolutely inconsistent with the facts. We appeal to common sense, ask whether Feng has the need to sever ties with the Kuomintang or the possibility of allying with Russia. Other rumors are lengthy, and I don't want to justify them any further. It is best to ask the press to organize a reporter group to go to Zhangjiakou to conduct an on-the-spot investigation to know the truth. Feng aims to resist Japan, and his situation is tragic. The Japanese army will inevitably invade Chahar. When the time comes to bravely resist foreign aggression, the facts will prove it.</p>

<p>Guo Xishi Attended the Joint Committee on Sericulture in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</p>
<p>Came to Shanghai to Borrow Funds for Road Construction</p>
<p>According to a "Shen Shi Telegraph News Agency" report from this port, Dong Xiujia, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, came to Shanghai to contact the banking community to borrow funds because the funds for the construction of Jiangsu roads are insufficient. Guo Xishi participated in the Joint Committee on Sericulture in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and visited the Provincial Agricultural Farm and Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Plant. He came to Shanghai on the 5th. A reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency specially visited him at his hotel and was received and gave the following interview:</p>
<p>Raising Funds for Road Construction, according to Dong, the most important thing for construction right now is to build roads. Convenient transportation can stabilize prices and avoid the risk of famine. However, due to the shortage of provincial treasury funds, it is necessary to contact the banking community in Shanghai to borrow funds so that the planned highways can be built section by section. He has already contacted the banking community several times with Shu Shifu, Director of the Finance Department, and there is good hope of success.</p>
<p>Attending the Joint Committee, Dong continued, while in Wuxi, he attended the meeting convened by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Sericulture Control Committee to restrict cocoon prices in Jiangsu. Because the weather in Jiangsu Province this year is excellent, the sericulture harvest is more than 80-90%. However, there are very few silkworm farmers. Judging from the current market, there is a shortage of supply. The Control Committee is afraid that the cocoon industry will arbitrarily release prices, which will affect the silk market. If silk prices are too high, it is not easy to export. For example, last year's old silk was rescued by the government for more than 3 million yuan before it could be exported. It is better to restrict cocoon prices in advance than to plan for relief in the future. Therefore, the final decision is that the improved seeds should not exceed 40 yuan per dan. If cocoon companies exceed this price, the government will revoke their licenses. The Wuxi cocoon merchants are quite able to comply. Therefore, the silk market this year will definitely not be as stagnant as last year.</p>
<p>Visiting the Agricultural Farm, Dong continued, after attending the restriction meeting, he visited the Provincial Agricultural Experiment Farm and the Sericulture Control Office. The instruments and equipment used are quite complete, and the work is also very diligent. In the future, inferior mulberry and inferior seeds will be completely banned. Finally, he visited the Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Plant. The water pumps and engines recently produced by the plant after a long period of research and improvement are quite comparable to imported products, which is a good phenomenon for my country's agriculture.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Plan for Water and Electricity Facilities in the City Center Area Has Been Determined <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Water Supply Facilities Are Being Implemented Sequentially</p>
<p>Electrical Engineering to Be Completed This Year</p>
<p>The City Government's new building and the temporary buildings of various bureaus in the city center area are being actively constructed and will soon be completed. The plan for all water and electrical equipment in the area, drawn up by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company at the order of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, has been discussed and agreed upon by all parties concerned and submitted to the Mayor for approval. The Mayor has approved it at the 237th Municipal Affairs Conference and will implement it immediately. The agreed-upon measures are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Water Supply Problem The measures that have been decided on the water supply aspect are roughly: (A) Zhabei will lay water pipes to all the most needed areas, and the rest will be laid sequentially at any time; (B) the cost of the first phase of pipe laying is estimated at 160,000 yuan; (C) the City Government guarantees that the annual water and electricity fees will be sufficient to cover 12% of the actual construction cost of the main pipe within five years. If there is a shortfall, the City Government will make it up. The cost of branch pipes other than the main pipe will be borne by the users.</p>
<p>Electrical Problem The measures discussed on the electrical problem are as follows: (A) Two underground cables will be used to connect the main transformer station on Xiangyin Road directly to both sides of the park, and then overhead lines will be used to form a ring, and then underground cables will be used to connect the twelve open-air booths; (B) low-voltage connection will be used for each area where the open-air booths are powered. If one open-air booth is damaged, it can be divided into two parts and powered by the nearby open-air booths to reduce the power transmission time. The above construction will be determined in order of priority according to the urgency of needs, but must be completed by the end of 1933; (C) The method of the City Government guaranteeing electricity revenue, excluding street lights, is the same as that for water supply.</p>

<p>Tianjin Also Cables on the Status of Receiving Refugees</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Office of the World Red Swastika Society received cables yesterday from its Chahar and Tianjin branches, reporting in detail on relief efforts. Excerpts are provided below: (1) The situation in Chahar Province is becoming increasingly tense, and relief efforts are likely to expand further. The Society's Eleventh Team has already departed for Zhangbei, and the Twelfth Team has departed for Kangnan. The Fifth and Sixth Hospitals have been reorganized, and work at the temporary treatment centers in Zhangbei, Xuanhua, and Kangzhuang is extremely busy. The General Office has appointed Li Tianzhen as supervisor to bring funds to handle post-disaster relief in the disaster area. However, subsequent relief efforts will become increasingly tense, and relief funds are gradually being exhausted. It is hoped that there will be a continuous stream of aid. (2) The Tianjin branch cabled that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Teams sent personnel to Wanwo and Mei, under the jurisdiction of Wuqing County, yesterday to rescue 700 to 800 refugees. A second group was sent to Meichang to rescue more than 500 refugees. Multiple personnel were also dispatched as far as Yongledian, Di, Xianghe, and Wuqing to receive and protect refugees coming to Tianjin, and multiple reception centers were established in Shibei Eighteen Villages, Dazhangzhuang, Ninghe, Pan'erzhuang, Lutai, and other places to accommodate refugees as much as possible. Additionally, more than ten carts carrying refugees from Ninghe, thirty miles from Tianjin, overturned due to the rugged roads, injuring many refugees. Doctors were dispatched urgently at night for rescue. The five large-scale reception centers in Dongjuzi and Tangjiakou are already overcrowded, and many extremely large shacks have been added outside the walls to accommodate as much as possible. Furthermore, Qu Wenliu and Feng Yangshan, specialists from the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Relief Committee, visited the facilities, witnessed the hunger of the refugees, and were deeply moved, promising to do their best to help.</p>
<p>County-Level Agencies</p>
<h3 id="e123">Petition to Postpone the Establishment of a Water Patrol Team <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The county-level agencies under the Shanghai County government submitted a document to the Civil Affairs Department, the Provincial Government, and the County Government, requesting postponement of the establishment of a water patrol team due to insufficient financial resources. The document stated: "Regarding the establishment of a water patrol team in this county, it was previously resolved by the council convened by your government that the joint meetings of various districts should discuss and decide on fundraising and management methods and report to the county, and then convene another meeting to make a decision, etc. After detailed discussion by Shi Jie and others, it was unanimously agreed that the chief magistrate's concern for the people's welfare and attention to waterborne security is indeed an act of benefiting the locality and should be followed. However, since the division of the city and county in this county, the essence of the city has all gone to the municipal government, and the remaining six districts are all impoverished rural areas with a population of less than 120,000 and an area of less than 500 li. Although the waterways in this county are numerous, the land area is not vast. Furthermore, in addition to the Huangpu River, the remaining waterways in this county are small and scattered ports with inconvenient passage for ships. Moreover, the First District Department of the Provincial Public Security Water Police is stationed here, and tax police patrol boats patrol from time to time, which is sufficient to maintain security. In addition, in recent years, all industries have been depressed, and taxes have been heavy. Starting last year, an additional fee for Qing Dynasty documents of one jiao per mu was levied, which has exceeded 2% of the land price. Even other donations and taxes have been exhausted, making it inconvenient to increase further. Therefore, although the public has the desire to increase police force and maintain security, they deeply feel powerless to contribute due to economic exhaustion. After repeated consideration, Shi Jie and others unanimously believe that this matter can be postponed. We hereby submit a joint petition to your esteemed chief magistrate, reporting the actual situation of the above-mentioned locality and the difficulties in fundraising, requesting that you, with your understanding, allow the temporary postponement of the establishment of the water patrol team in this county. Once the people's strength is slightly restored and funds are available, we will then organize the team in accordance with the regulations. If there is anything inappropriate, we respectfully request your review and approval, which would be in the public interest. Respectfully submitted by Jiang Shijie, Director of the Shanghai County Public Funds and Public Property Management Office; Wang Yiren, Chief of the Sixth District; Wu Shifang, Chief of the First District; Huang Xingrang, Director of the County Farmers' Association; Peng Zhaotang, Chief of the Second District; Zhang Yi, Director of the County Education Association; Sun Shiben, Chief of the Third District; Zhang Jingling, Chairman of the Minhang Chamber of Commerce; Fu Dianying, Chief of the Fourth District; Zhang Yunxuan, Chairman of the Sanlin Chamber of Commerce; Xing Zhigang, Chief of the Fifth District; and Tu Bingjun, Chairman of the Maqiao Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>An Exhibition Will Be Held in Beijing on a Scheduled Date</p>
<p>Peng Boxun, Director of the National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry, and Gong Cao, Secretary-General, came to Shanghai yesterday from Beijing to contact national goods organizations such as the China National Goods Maintenance Association, the Shanghai Citizens National Goods Promotion Association, and the National Goods Factory Federation to discuss matters related to participating in the exhibition to be held in Beijing on June 20th. The official letter from the Hall to the various national goods organizations is recorded below: "Dear Sirs, Promoting national goods is a crucial plan to increase production and resist economic invasion. The entire country shares the same determination. Our Hall, located in the central government, should fulfill its responsibility to promote and implement this plan. During this period of serious national crisis, we should raise our voices to awaken the people. Only with collective effort can we succeed. We rely on the support of virtuous and capable people across the country. Our Hall, established for nearly four years, plans to hold the fourth annual exhibition in June to promote and facilitate observation. The exhibition is scheduled to last for one month, and a temporary exhibition market will be opened in the east courtyard of our Hall for national goods manufacturers to set up temporary shops to sell their products. We will also hire industry experts to form a product review committee to conduct detailed reviews of various exhibits. Those with excellent products will be specially rewarded to encourage them. We have long admired your association's enthusiasm for promoting national goods. We hope that you will collect various national products from your area as much as possible and deliver them to our Hall before June 15th for display and promotion. We have enclosed eighty copies of the collection rules, product description forms, product application forms, and product catalogs. Please check and comply accordingly."</p>
<h3 id="e125">National Goods Touring Group Departs Tomorrow <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>To Participate in National Goods Exhibitions in Dinghai and Yongjia Counties</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens National Goods Promotion Association and the China National Goods Maintenance Association are expanding the national goods movement, concentrating national salvation efforts, and leading the Shanghai National Goods Touring Group to participate in the national goods exhibitions in Dinghai and Yongjia Counties. Preparations have been made diligently, and work has been accelerated. All procedures have been completed, and factories are participating enthusiastically. However, due to the limited space, only one hundred booths are available, so it has been necessary to limit participation. As a result, there are twenty to thirty factories that wanted to participate but could not register. It is learned that the Association has scheduled the afternoon of July 7th and the morning of July 8th for loading goods. At 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, all three hundred members of the group will gather at Pier No. 9, South City, 16th Pier, and depart on the Yili export ship. It was also resolved at the fifth factory representatives' meeting to advance the opening date to the 12th of this month to allow ample time to participate in the Qingdao National Goods Exhibition. Seal, badges, and shipping permits required for participating factories were issued starting yesterday.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Reply to the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3 id="e126">Wu Song Vehicle and Boat Taxes Cannot Be Reduced <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a request to the Municipal Government to order the relevant bureaus to reduce or exempt the small vehicle and small boat taxes in Wu Song to facilitate the economic recovery of Wu Song. It is learned that the Municipal Government replied to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Your submission has been noted. After consulting with the Public Utilities and Finance Bureaus, it was reported that the Wu Song small vehicle tax has been approved by your government to be reduced for six months starting from April of this year. The reduction period has just begun, and it is too early to assess the actual benefits of the tax reduction for small vehicles. The request for extension seems unnecessary. Regarding the request to exempt Wu Song sampans from registration and tax payment, the situation has been previously reported, making it difficult to make changes. According to the Public Utilities Bureau's investigation, the Wu Song sampans that are currently registered are engaged in lighterage operations in the city and are not struggling. Furthermore, the license fees paid at the time of registration can be refunded when the license is returned in accordance with the regulations, so the boat owners do not actually suffer any losses. The Finance Bureau's investigation shows that these boats are taxed at the lowest rate of 50 cents per month, which is a very small amount and cannot be reduced. Our bureaus have also reviewed that the boat owners' representatives, Gu Chuanlang and others, previously requested a 50% reduction in taxes and asked various shops to request tax exemption on their behalf, which seems contradictory and not from the boat owners' original intention, and should be rejected. In addition to instructions, this reply is hereby issued. Please inform them accordingly."</p>
<h3 id="e127">Zhejiang Waters Pirates Gradually Eliminated <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Ouyang Ge's Letter to the Ningbo Association Reports</p>
<p>Patrols by Yongping and Other Warships are Sent During the Fishing Season</p>
<p>The Ningbo Association in Shanghai received a letter yesterday from Ouyang Ge, the commander of the Second Brigade of the Zhejiang Water Police, reporting on the progress of work and the suppression of bandits. The details are quite thorough, so excerpts are recorded below:</p>
<p>"Regarding the work situation, the unrest in the Zhejiang waters in recent years is undeniable. However, the lack of training for the water police, the absence of motors on patrol boats, the lack of repairs to warships, and the incompleteness of weapons all hinder the progress of arrest operations. We had planned to actively reorganize, but due to financial constraints, we were unable to fully implement our plans. We have only focused on reorganization within the possible scope, training the water police and closely instructing subordinates. In recent months, although we have not been able to achieve everything perfectly, we have cracked more than twenty major robbery cases, arrested more than sixty bandits, and rescued a total of more than one hundred hostages.</p>
<p>Regarding the bandit suppression process, in the battle of Baiyan, Wenling, the notorious bandits Zhang Zhuqing and Ying Zhaocai, as well as more than ten other bandits, were killed. In the battle of Chongfu, Linhai, more than two thousand tins of kerosene from the Guanghua Company and four shipmates were intercepted. After the Yongchuan merchant ship was robbed, a number of criminals who were hiding stolen goods, including Xu Rende, were detected in Dachen Mountain, along with many stolen items. Recently, in Xiaoyao Gate, Dinghai, there was a long and fierce battle with the bandits, killing several, capturing two alive, seizing three pirate ships, and rescuing twenty-three refugees, as well as many stolen items such as matches and kerosene. Also, twenty-two refugees and six large and small sailing boats were rescued in Dongji Mountain. When the Ning aluminum company's Nanxing ship recently ran aground on the grinding disc in Haimen and encountered bandits, the Yongping and other ships, as well as the fourth platoon, were ordered to rush to rescue. Unfortunately, the ships were sailing vessels and could not arrive instantly, so the rescue was not perfect. All the escaped bandits are still being actively investigated.</p>
<p>To protect fishermen and merchants, during the current fishing season, the Yongping, Taian, and Xinbinshun ships, as well as special forces, have been dispatched to the fishing areas to patrol and suppress bandits, with Inspector Xu as the commander-in-chief, temporarily stationed in Haimen to supervise operations. Now that the major bandit gangs have been gradually annihilated, they have become less visible. The small, scattered bandits who harass fishermen and merchants are moving around in various locations, making it exhausting to pursue them. Patrol ships are cruising along the coast at all times, and patrol boats are also deployed in various locations, never slacking. We are doing our best, but we dare not claim complete success."</p>

<h3 id="e128">Trial Opens in the Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Case <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>(Yin Jiafu Was a Soldier in the 19th Route Army)</p>
<p>Police Detectives Search Wu Mai's Residence</p>
<p>The Arguments in the Case Conclude, and the Verdict Will Be Announced on a Scheduled Date</p>
<p>Following the successive bombings of various foreign goods stores, such as Ri Xin Zeng, De Sheng Xiang, De Feng Xiang, Fu Xiang Ji, and Lü Tai Chang, as well as other foreign goods and cotton stores, along French Avenue, by the Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Group, which involved throwing bombs, damaging doors, windows, glass, and goods, and occasionally injuring store employees, the French Concession Police paid close attention to the matter as a disruption to order and security. Detectives, both Chinese and foreign, were instructed to strictly investigate the case. However, the whereabouts of these individuals were extremely secret, making it difficult to crack the case. Until noon on the 3rd of this month, Detective No. 323 of the Political Department of the French Concession Police received a tip that a secret meeting was being held on the third floor of the Wei Zhen Guangdong Food Store at No. 45 Kai Zi Er Road at 6:00 PM to discuss illegal activities. The detective reported this to Deputy Police Commissioner and Department Chief Rao Boze (transliteration), who ordered Ma Muya (transliteration), the director of the investigation department, to lead Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the location at the specified time (No. 45 Kai Zi Er Road, i.e., Daode Lane). They saw two people going upstairs, and the detectives rushed to the third floor to arrest them. However, one person had already escaped, and only Yin Jiafu (age 39), a native of Zhengzhou, Henan, was apprehended. Inside the room, a hand grenade (made in China), fifteen photos, a suitcase, and letters were found in the desk drawer, as well as a set of blue cloth shirt and trousers. A piece of paper with the names Wang Shoushan and Wu Mai was found in the trouser pocket on the bed. They were taken to the police station for interrogation. Yin confessed that the place was a contact point for the Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Group, managed by Wang Shoushan, with Wu Mai as the food officer. The organization was originally located in Room 33, Xinping Apartment, Gengyu Lane, Pubai Road, and moved to No. 45 Daode Lane on the 3rd of this month (i.e., the day of the arrest). Based on the confession, the police sent detectives back to Daode Lane to wait and arrest accomplices. At the same time, they sent detectives to search the home of lawyer Wu Mai at No. 8 Garden Villa, Huanlong Road. Wu and his family were not at home, and only the maid, Chen Zhoushi from Yangzhou, was present. A business card of Wang Shoushan was found in the dresser on the third floor, and two delivery books were found on the bamboo bookshelf in the downstairs study, including letters from the Self-Help Association for Resisting Foreign Aggression and Yun Huifang (who was arrested for throwing a bomb at Maochang Foreign Cloth Store at No. 347 Minguo Road on August 5th of the previous year and sentenced by the Special No. 2 Court to two months' imprisonment with a two-year reprieve). The detectives took them back to the police station. They also went to Xinping Apartment to question the tea room attendant, Wang Xuekuan (age 32, native of Zhenjiang). Wang confessed that a guest who called himself Wang Abao came on March 14th of this year and first opened Room 33. On May 8th, he switched to Room 23 and left the apartment on the 27th. During that time, he had opened other rooms, but the numbers were no longer remembered. However, Wang often came with many people, and Yin Jiafu had also been there and had seen him. Wang sometimes wore Chinese clothes and sometimes Western clothes. After investigation, the police found that they had opened Rooms 25, 26, 28, 23, and 33 of Xinping Apartment from January 17th to May 27th. The plainclothes detectives waiting at No. 45 Daode Lane arrested two Cantonese youths in Western suits at 1:25 PM the next day (the 4th). One claimed to be Kuang Wenyi, 22 years old, working at the Yong'an Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Lan Road, and the other claimed to be Kuang Beihai, 27 years old, working at the Taicang Electric Light Factory. The two were uncle and nephew and had come to find Wang Shoushan. The detectives took them to the police station and began to investigate whether the defendants were related to the bombing of Ri Xin Zeng and De Sheng Xiang, two foreign goods stores on French Avenue. Ri Xin Zeng was bombed four times, with two bombs failing to explode and two exploding. Both bombs at De Sheng Xiang exploded. Yesterday afternoon, the police sent Yin and others to the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Local Court. Judge Li Changnian interrogated them. Yin, who was bald and wore a black cotton shirt and trousers with a white undershirt and shoes without socks, stood in the defendant's dock with the other two. First, the police lawyers, Fei Xizhen and Yao Zhaodi, stated the case, alleging that the defendants participated in an association for the purpose of committing crimes, using explosives, and intentionally harming the lives and property of others. They threw bombs at stores in the concession, causing damage. The defendants were charged with disrupting order, endangering public safety, and destroying property under Articles 158, 161, 190, 200, 201, 381, and 382 of the Criminal Code. The police submitted photographs of the seized hand grenades and other exhibits. The judge asked the defendants about their age and origin. As it was almost noon, the judge adjourned the hearing until the afternoon. At 3:30 PM, Judge Li and clerk Wang Baoxun returned to the Criminal Division to continue the interrogation. The police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, appeared in court. Yin Jiafu confessed that he had been a soldier in the 19th Route Army. After the Shanghai War, he was transferred to Fujian. After being discharged, he went to Guangdong and came to Shanghai in January of this year, living in a thatched shed behind No. 1415 Yinghua Lane, Robert's Road. Wang Dongcai introduced him to the Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Group and gave him 20 yuan per month. The group was managed by Wang Shoushan, and Wu Mai was the investigator. Wang Shoushan was from Anhui, about 35 years old. He had also been a battalion commander in the 19th Route Army, so he was also acquainted with him. The bombing was carried out after Wu investigated and reported the details. He was sent to wait near the store. At the appropriate time, Wang Dongcai would give him the bomb and order him to throw it. Wang Dongcai would report the results to Wang Shoushan. He threw bombs four times in the British and French concessions. The first time was in January at a certain foreign goods store on French Avenue (i.e., Ri Xin Zeng). The second and third times were in March at two foreign goods stores near the Xianshi Company on Fourth Avenue and Wuxi Road in the British Concession, both in alleys. The fourth time was in May at a foreign goods store in Zhengjia Wood Bridge (i.e., De Sheng Xiang). Of the four bombings, two exploded and two did not. He did not know the people who were identified by the detectives when they were arrested. On the day of his arrest, he was at home when Dongcai came and called him to clean the room at No. 45 Daode Lane. Wang escaped, and he was arrested. He did not know who had hidden the seized hand grenade there. He did not know where the two Wangs had fled to. He did not know Kuang and the others. Kuang Wenyi confessed that Wang Shoushan was his mother-in-law's adopted son and was introduced to him by his wife, but only for less than a month. Wang told him that he had just moved to No. 45 Daode Lane, so he went to visit him with his uncle that afternoon and was arrested. He knew nothing about the bombs. Kuang Beihai confessed that he had just come to Shanghai from Taicang three days ago and was living in the Qingnian Apartment on North Sichuan Road. He was arrested with his nephew Wenyi that day and claimed to know nothing about the bombs. As he did not speak Shanghainese, he could not answer the remaining questions but claimed to know nothing about the bombs. At this point, the plainclothes detectives reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants. The judge ordered the arguments to begin. After the police lawyer made the arguments, the court announced that the arguments were concluded and that the verdict would be announced on a scheduled date. The defendants were taken back into custody, and the court adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>

<p>Hu Lifu Changes Name to Hu Junyuan</p>
<p>The traitor Hu Lifu was executed in Suzhou by strangulation. Hu was 53 years old and had four sons (one of whom was a lawyer). Upon hearing the news in Shanghai, his third son took 300 yuan in cash (the youngest son was still in school and did not go) and took the early morning express train to Suzhou. At the Sishi Street branch prison, he signed a statement to claim the body for coffining. He immediately spent 150 yuan in Suzhou to buy a coffin and clothes, and hired four porters to carry the coffin to Changmen. He paid to hire a small steamboat to transport the coffin to Shanghai that day. Yesterday morning, the boat arrived at Xinzha Bridge and asked a local bailiff named Ling to find a guild hall. Fearing that Hu was a traitor, the guild hall refused to allow the coffin to be stored there. He changed his name to Hu Junyuan and hired workers to carry the coffin into a temporary special room. The annual fee for storing the coffin was estimated at 8 yuan. He planned to choose another date to transport the coffin back to his ancestral home in Yongjia for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Police Bust Electricity Theft Ring <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>More Than Sixty People Involved in Electricity Theft</p>
<p>Hundreds of Cases Committed</p>
<p>Lu Liankui, the Chinese Chief Detective of the Public Concession Police's General Inspection Department, and Chinese Detective Shao Jingfan recently cracked a large-scale electricity theft ring and arrested the criminals Cheng Zhangcai, Zhang Yulin, Liu Zhaoji, Zhao Xingkui, Huang Youliang, Ding Jintao, Wang Genfa, Yang Jingfu, Zhou Wenliang, Zhou Yiqing, Fan Chushan, and others. Most of them were employees and workers of the power company. More than sixty people were involved in the electricity theft. The police are investigating the details of the crime. Yesterday morning, the police sent the arrested Cheng Zhangcai and the other twelve to the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that although the case was a theft case, the actual situation was extremely serious. The number of people involved in the crime was large, and the number of cases committed was no less than several hundred. As far as the police knew, there were already more than two hundred cases. Therefore, the investigation would take some time. The matter was of great importance to the security and order of the concession, and the remaining accomplices were being pursued. Therefore, the trial could not proceed today, and it was requested that the trial be postponed for two weeks and a special court be opened to hear the case. The defendants, represented by lawyers Jiang Yiping, Shen Xingxia, Lin Yingqing, Du Jimei, and Lu Qi, requested bail, an earlier trial date, or exemption from sending them to Western Jail before the verdict was reached. Feng Shide, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, ordered that the defendants be detained and postponed the trial to 2:00 PM on the 23rd of this month. The police were allowed to request the release of any defendants who were not related to the case at any time.</p>

<p>Selling Absolutely Prohibited After 11 O'Clock</p>
<p>At the vegetable market streets and the Eight Immortals Bridge vegetable market in the French Concession, after the police patrol bell rings, some vendors, still greedy for profit, often violate the Municipal Council's market rules by setting up stalls and selling goods privately, resulting in numerous stalls along the way. To rectify this situation, the Municipal Council sends police officers to ring a bell around 11 AM every morning to warn vendors to close their stalls. If vendors continue to sell privately along the way, numerous police officers are dispatched, followed by trucks, to transport these vendors, along with their vegetables, to the police station for punishment. However, the vendors have not changed their behavior. Therefore, after closing the stalls yesterday morning, the police dispatched numerous officers with several trucks, arriving at the market from both the east and west sides. When the vendors saw them, they tried to escape, but as police were present on both sides, they had no choice but to surrender. They, along with their vegetables, were taken to the police station for punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e139">County Agricultural Education Center Trials Mint Planting <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Increase Production: Resist Foreign Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Zhuanqiao Farmers' Education Center has repeatedly received instructions from the County Government Education Bureau stating that mint is a major raw material for modern industry and medicine, with a high demand, but the domestic quantity is quite small, insufficient to meet demand. The import of foreign goods increases annually, causing a significant outflow of wealth, which is regrettable. China's soil is fertile, and if planting can be promoted, agricultural production can be increased. Planting mint is not subject to waterlogging, drought, or famine, and can supplement the shortage of beans, grains, and vegetables. Given the current state of agriculture in our county, planting should be vigorously promoted to enrich the people. Upon receiving the order, Director Zhang of the Center has begun planting in the open field, leading by example for the farmers. If the results are excellent in the future, it will be vigorously promoted.</p>

<p>At the end of last month, a male corpse was found murdered at the Wangjiazhai Cemetery in the Xiqiao Railway area of western Shanghai. The Second District Police Station investigated and determined that the victim was Sun Zhiyuan, a worker at the Junfeng Cloth Factory, and that Xuan Zhiben, who slept next to him, was suspected. Therefore, Xuan was arrested and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for transfer to the court for interrogation. Sun Wenhua reported to the Gaochang Temple Substation, claiming that the deceased was his cousin, originally from Gaoyang County, Hebei Province. In January of this year, Sun Zhiyuan beat his uncle, Sun Mingxun, to death at home, so they fled to Shanghai together. Sun Wenhua introduced him to work at the Yu Feng Cloth Factory at No. 1 Taide Lane, Xujiahui. On the first day of this month, Liang Wenming introduced him to work at the cloth factory at No. 24 Wulibao, Jumen Road. That night, he shared a bed with Li Quanfu and two others. Suddenly, he was hacked to death with an axe. Liang Wenming reported the news, and it was then learned that the deceased was thirty-one years old. The report was sent to the Second District Headquarters. It was confirmed that Sun Wenhua's report indicated suspicion and that Sun had committed patricide in his hometown. It was deemed necessary to investigate whether the murder was part of a conspiracy, so the report was sent to the Public Security Bureau, which transferred it to the Local Court for interrogation yesterday.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at approximately 4:00 PM, Tian Chunyao, police officer No. 2350 of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau of Zhabei, was on duty in front of the Zhengchanghe Rice Store near the Xinzha Bridge on Datong Road. The officer was cleaning his handgun when, for unknown reasons, he inadvertently triggered the mechanism. A bullet fired from the gun, heading straight into the rice store. It struck Zhou Zhangzhi, a 30-year-old clerk from Tongzhou who worked at the store, hitting a vital area. Zhou immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Qiu Wen, the owner of the store, witnessed the incident and ordered someone to take Zhou to the Western Tibetan Road Epidemic Hospital, but the hospital refused to accept him. He was then transferred to Renji Hospital, where he died despite medical treatment. The hospital reported the incident to the Huishi Police Department, which dispatched investigators to investigate. The body was moved to the Feilun Road morgue for examination. The officer, realizing that he had caused an accident, knew there was no escape and was taken into custody by another officer at the Fourth District Bureau. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court reported the incident and appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei to visit the morgue to examine the body and conduct a public inquiry. According to Qiu Wen, 37 years old, a local and owner of the store, he was in the store having a haircut when he saw the officer cleaning the gun. He was only a few steps away and asked him if the gun was loaded. The officer replied that it was. Unexpectedly, at that moment, the bullet was discharged. Qiu also stated that the officer and the deceased did not know each other. Shen Kezhi, a police chief dispatched by the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, stated that the officer involved in the incident had been taken into custody at the bureau pending interrogation and transfer to the General Bureau. After receiving the evidence, Guo determined that Zhou Zhangzhi died from a gunshot wound. The body was released to Zhou Wen after he signed a guarantee for burial. As the crime occurred in the inland area, the suspect, officer No. 2350, should be handled by the inland court in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>Japanese Goods Sell Well in Yangtze River Ports</p>
<p>(Japanese Goods Flood In)</p>
<p>Due to the brisk sales of Japanese goods in various Yangtze River ports, Japanese merchants have recently been rushing to load large quantities of Japanese goods in Shanghai, with some being transferred to various Yangtze River ports. Therefore, the Yangtze River ships of the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha have been fully loaded with Japanese goods on every trip recently. The Nippon Yusen Kaisha has designated eight ships, including the Mikasa Maru, Asuka Maru, Tsukuba Maru, and Rokko Maru, to rush the loading process. More than 50,000 pieces of goods from various Japanese ports have arrived in Shanghai in the past six days. It is reported that there are still 300,000 to 400,000 pieces that need to be transported to Shanghai in a short period of time. The eight designated ships are insufficient for transportation, so the Nippon Yusen Kaisha has specially dispatched the overseas giant ship Tsuruga Maru to the Shanghai route, dedicated to transporting Japanese goods to Shanghai. Showa Yoko also dispatched three ships to carry large quantities of Japanese goods to China.</p>
<p>(Import of Military Equipment)</p>
<p>The Japanese Navy in the Yangtze River recently dispatched the commander of the Third Fleet, Minei, to Wuhan for inspection and is implementing an expansion of its forces. The Japanese Ministry of the Navy has now dispatched the transport ship Bed Zhi, fully loaded with a large number of rifles, handguns, machine guns, artillery, bullets, and explosives, to Shanghai to be allocated to the Third Fleet and distributed to the Japanese Navy in the Yangtze River. The transport ship entered the port at noon today and immediately unloaded the military equipment at the Huishan and Osaka docks into the armory. The ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to Japan on the 8th.</p>

<p>Summer Arrives, and Odors Permeate</p>
<p>Hope for Prompt Dredging to Restore Sanitation</p>
<p>The Puhuitang Dredging Promotion Committee, composed of people from Songjiang and Qingpu counties, chaired by Ma Xiangbo and with committee member Gu Rungui, petitioned the Post-War Rehabilitation Committee of the National Government's Songhu War Zone, requesting them to urge the Municipal Government to instruct the Public Works Bureau to complete the dredging of the sixth district of the Puhuitang River west of Tianyao Bridge in western Shanghai. This area passes through Xujiahui and Tushanwan, with a mix of Chinese and foreign residents and numerous schools. As summer has arrived, this issue is of great importance to the drinking water sanitation of residents and the traffic of boats. Their petition states: "Regarding the matter of petitioning, the Puhuitang River in Songjiang and Qingpu has been reported for dredging for many days. Xiangbo and his colleagues have repeatedly urged the Shanghai section to be completed as soon as possible to comfort the hopes of hundreds of thousands of people along the river. The numerous documents are all in the clear understanding of your council. The former Standing Committee Member Zhang Shouyong and Hu Junzhuang, inspected the river project and also made verbal requests. It was approved to urge the Shanghai Municipal Government to complete the work. However, after nearly a month, the opened ones could not be completed, and the so-called sixth section from Tianyao Bridge to Liu Jing Bridge, which passes through Xujiahui and Tushanwan, with a mix of Chinese and foreign residents and numerous schools, is the most important. Not only has the work not started, but the black water still flows westward without stopping. The people along the river, seeing this situation, are disturbed and tell each other, with many doubts about the Public Works Bureau's plan to complete the river. Now that summer has arrived, the weather is hot, and the odors permeate, which hinders sanitation and endangers lives. Heaven cherishes life, how can we ignore this? Moreover, the sections of Songjiang and Qingpu, from Longgui Nunnery to Jiepai Bridge, have been completed and released, but the water does not flow smoothly. All places near the market towns have turned ochre. Flowing water does not rot, an ancient saying is clear. This not only hinders traffic, but also makes drinking water difficult for residents. Your council holds wisdom and concerns for the people. We implore you to urge the Shanghai Municipal Government to instruct the Public Works Bureau to immediately start work on this sixth section of the undredged river and complete it within a time limit, so that the entire river can flow smoothly, and the people will be grateful, living in harmony and singing praises endlessly. This is truly the blessing of the local area and the good fortune of Xiangbo and others. We present our urgent words, waiting for orders."</p>
<h3 id="e147">Levy of Fisheries Construction Fee <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Mediation Today</p>
<p>Four fish merchants, Dashengyuan Chang, and others, from the Ice-Fresh Fish Trade Association, as well as Shibu bucket fish merchants, objected to the levy of construction fees by the Fisheries Improvement Committee of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions, resulting in the confiscation of goods by the Fisheries Administration Bureau. Subsequently, Yu Qiaqing intervened to mediate, fearing that the fresh fish would rot and spoil if left unattended, and allowed the fish to be temporarily returned. It was agreed to discuss the matter further today. According to news from the Fisheries Construction Collection Office, Chen Gongbo, Minister of the Ministry of Industry, believes that Japanese invasion of the Chinese fishery market causes annual losses. To rectify the fishery administration and recover rights, thorough rectification is necessary. However, according to the Fisheries Law, the levy of fishery tax must not exceed 5% of the value. Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Fang Jiaobo, Zhang Shenzhi, Dai Yongtang, Wu Zhenpan, and others opposed this and formed a tax exemption maintenance committee to fight for tax exemption. The Executive Yuan then approved 2% of the value and decided to use the money taken from the fishermen for fishery construction. All previous license fees and miscellaneous taxes were canceled. However, Du and others still believed that this was not enough, as the power was in the hands of the government, and there was concern that the name and reality would not match in the future. Therefore, they petitioned for the establishment of another Fisheries Improvement Committee, with eleven committee members, exceeding the number of fisheries and commercial committee members determined by the Ministry by two. They fought to increase the number to six. The committee established five groups: Economics, Management, Design, Audit, and General Affairs, and began collecting the 2% fisheries construction fee, publicly recommending Dai Yongtang as the director of the collection office. At this time, Director Dai was the Director of General Affairs of the Ice-Fresh Fish Trade Association and reluctantly agreed to take office after being strongly urged. After Director Dai took office, no construction fee was collected. To protect fishermen during the fishing season, he first purchased two patrol ships with advance payments to protect them. After collecting the 1% construction fee, all miscellaneous taxes were canceled. Eight groups of fresh fish merchants and public offices unanimously approved and telegraphed their approval. Previously, with the 1% value, including license fees, each fishing boat had to pay more than 50 yuan. Later, the ocean protection fee was also more than 30 yuan. Now, with the 1% construction fee, if a fishing boat sells goods worth 2,000 yuan, it only needs to pay 20 yuan. Why wouldn't the fishermen be happy? Now, four fish merchants, including Dacheng Yuanchang, and others, in collusion with Shibu bucket fish merchants, are unreasonably objecting, obviously being fooled by a certain country and stirring up trouble. Some unscrupulous merchants are abetting the villains and secretly forming organizations to control and manipulate the situation. The Fisheries Administration Bureau's patrol ship confiscated the fresh fish for non-payment of the construction fee. After mediation by Yu Qiaqing and Fang Jiaobo, the Bureau approved the release, as the fresh fish would rot if left unattended. As for how to make them fully pay the construction fee, Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Yu Zuoting, and Director Dai will discuss the matter in detail this afternoon at the Ningbo Fellow Association to mediate the matter.</p>
<p>The "Daily News" reports that the Ice-Fresh Fish Trade Association of this city received a notice (No. 41) from the Ham, Salted Fish, and Dried Fish Trade Association of Hangzhou City, stating: "Notice regarding the fisheries construction fee, which our merchants collect on behalf of the government, has been reported to the government and relevant agencies for the record. We have now received instructions from the Provincial Party Department and the Municipal Government, as well as a letter forwarded from the Zhejiang Provincial Chamber of Commerce, stating that the case has been forwarded to the Ministry of Industry for revocation and has been notified to local chambers of commerce and fish merchants. In the future, regarding the construction fee, whether it is ice-fresh or Daqingshan goods, do not pay or collect on behalf of others before the issue is resolved. As the shippers are purely merchants and not fishermen, they have no tax obligations. Therefore, we issue this notice to inform all merchants that they must stop payment as a whole. We issue this notice."</p>

<p>The Case Was Solved the Day After the Incident</p>
<p>Bald-Headed Robbers Are Easiest to Identify</p>
<p>Guo Boru, a Cantonese deputy manager of Deldi Real Estate Company at No. 7 Shengping Lane, Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, lives at No. 390 Yuantai Lane, Shandong Road, Public Concession. Because he had spare rooms for rent, he posted rental notices at the front and back doors. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, at 1 PM, several robbers knocked on the back door of Guo's house, claiming to rent a house. Guo's maid, Wang Ajin, opened the door and let them in. When these people entered, they claimed to be renting the house to establish a general association. Guo was not at home at the time. His family, hearing the words "general association", expressed their unwillingness to rent the house. At this moment, one of the bald-headed robbers in the group thought that the opportunity should not be missed. He pulled out a handgun and drove everyone in the house to a corner, prohibiting them from making any noise. The remaining robbers entered the rooms, turning over boxes and chests, and plundered extensively for a long time before escaping. Afterward, Guo returned home with the police. Upon inspection, it was found that precious ornaments, clothes, and cash worth approximately 4,661 yuan had been stolen. Guo filed a report with the police, requesting their apprehension. The next day, detectives Tang Jian, Ding Huaguo, Lu Gendi, Zhao Fuhai, and Sun Jishan of the Xinzha Police Station learned that the robbers were having tea upstairs at a Leyuetian Tea House on Nanjing Road. They rushed to search and apprehended three robbers: the bald-headed robber Li Yulin, Zhao Afu, and Liang Shunshun. They found a platinum ring, a diamond ring, a sapphire ring, a gold ring, a gold watch, a gold chain, and 699 yuan in cash on the robbers. They were taken back to the police station. Upon questioning, they revealed that their hideout was Room 23 at the Nanfang Hotel on Jiujiang Road. The Chinese and foreign detectives then rushed to search the room and found another 600 yuan in cash behind the mirror frame hanging on the wall. All of the stolen goods were sent to the First Special District Local Court yesterday morning. Judge Qian Wenji conducted the preliminary hearing. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated the case, and Detective Tang then reported the circumstances of the case in detail, presenting all the recovered stolen goods to the court one by one. The victim, Guo Boru, also brought his maid, Wang Ajin, to the court. Wang identified Li Yulin as the robber holding the handgun, as Li's bald head made him easily recognizable, and stated that Zhao Afu was also one of the robbers present. The judge then questioned the robbers. Only Liang Shunshun denied being a robber. However, as the case required further investigation, the judge ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Follow-Up on the Datong Hotel Blood Case <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Dongrong, a 20-year-old Cantonese man, serves as a quartermaster in the Second Battalion of the 364th Regiment of the 183rd Brigade of the 61st Division of the 19th Route Army. He has been married to his wife, Zeng, for many years, but their relationship is not very harmonious. After Qiu left with the army for Fujian, Zeng lived with her in-laws at the Guangtailai Hotel at No. 107 Edward Road (which she owns). However, the relationship between the daughter-in-law and her in-laws was not close, leading to frequent disputes within the family. Recently, Zeng left home because she could no longer endure domestic abuse and sought help from the Women's Association. Qiu Dongrong learned of this and left the army to come to Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, at 2 PM, he suddenly met Zeng at a friend's house at No. 5 Dade Lane, North Sichuan Road. Upon meeting, the couple was overcome with emotion. Qiu asked her to go to the movies with him, and she agreed. They went out together, and after watching the movie at 5 PM, they went to the Datong Hotel on Yinhua Street and booked Room 517 to stay together. At 7 PM, Qiu left the room, went to Guangtailai, obtained a razor, hid it on his person, and returned to the hotel at 8 PM. The two spent some time together. At 7:30 AM the next morning, as Zeng was fast asleep, Qiu suddenly had a murderous intention. He took out the razor and slashed Zeng's throat. Zeng woke up in extreme pain, resisted, and shouted for help, causing her to be slashed several more times. The tea server heard the commotion and reported it to the Laozha Police Station by telephone. They immediately ordered Detective Huang Yingjie and a foreign detective to go and arrest Qiu. They also took Zeng to the hospital for treatment. As reported in this newspaper, yesterday morning, the police escorted Qiu to the First Special Court Criminal Division. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated the previous circumstances and stated that he was being prosecuted for premeditated murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Law and should be severely punished according to law. The defendant's lawyer then stated that the court should note that the defendant is an active-duty soldier and should be tried by a military court in accordance with the law before proceeding with the trial. He submitted the symbol and requested a change of date so that evidence could be presented. The police lawyer also agreed. When questioned, Qiu Dongrong stated, "I left the army for Shanghai on February 20 because I was very angry about this family matter. When I came to Shanghai, my superiors knew about it, but I did not ask for leave. On March 1, I received a letter from my superiors approving my resignation." Judge Feng ruled that since the defendant had confessed to leaving the army, he was no longer a soldier, so there was no need for a ruling. As it was getting late, he ordered a change of date for further questioning. The court ordered the forensic doctor to examine Qiu's injuries and verify what happened.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Those Asking for Directions Were Robbers <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Robbers Conspired Several Times</p>
<p>Robbed a Cigarette Paper Store</p>
<p>Wang Wengen, a shop assistant from Ningbo, working for the Qinchang Cigarette Paper Store at No. 52 Wusong Road, was carrying 1,300 yuan in cash to a money shop at No. 136 Ningbo Road at 8:15 AM the day before yesterday to deposit the money. As he was walking along North Suzhou Road, a Shaoxing man, Wu Leshan, suddenly approached Wang and asked for directions to Huishan Road. Wang pointed the way. After walking a few steps, three robbers suddenly blocked his path. One robber pulled out a handgun, stopping Wang from making any noise. The other two robbers robbed all the cash Wang was carrying and fled in different directions. Wang then realized that the person asking for directions was an accomplice. He followed them to Zhabu Road Bridge, where he shouted for the police at No. 1184 to come. They arrested Wu and took him to the Hongkou Police Station for strict questioning. Wu confessed that he had conspired with the three robbers who were still at large. He was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court. Judge Wu Zehan opened the court for preliminary hearing. The police lawyer stated the case, saying that the defendant had conspired with the three robbers at large, Liu Decai, Luo Ayin, and Shen Ruifang (also known as Ni Juren), at a tea house near Dexing Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, several times in advance. They knew that the store had all the money collected on Saturdays and Sundays and sent the shop assistant to deposit it at a money shop on Ningbo Road every Monday. Therefore, yesterday morning, they waited on North Suzhou Road to commit the robbery. He requested a postponement so that the accomplices could be arrested. After Judge Li questioned the defendant, he ordered him to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<p>Guomin She reports that a man named Wen Kai, who claimed to be the director of the Fifth Branch of the Returning Overseas Chinese Propaganda Team, had been visiting various organizations in Shanghai, requesting public publicity, and there were reports of him engaging in deceptive behavior. The Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Propaganda Committee, upon learning of this, determined that the team had not been approved or registered, and that he had unauthorizedly appointed himself as the director of a branch team, engaging in deceptive activities everywhere, which was extremely absurd. Therefore, they specifically ordered all local party branches to investigate and prohibit such activities to prevent deception.</p>

<p>▲Recent Situation of the Housing Rental Company Located at No. 526, Continental Commercial Building, Nanjing Road, the Housing Rental Company has seen a constant stream of landlords entrusting the registration of vacant houses since its opening. Banks such as Siming Bank, Kenye Bank, and Jianye Bank, as well as major real estate companies and construction companies, have entrusted the company to register and introduce their properties. The fees are extremely low, and the results are very fast. On the tenant side, not only are there no fees, but also 10% discount coupons for moving companies are offered. To celebrate the company's one-week anniversary and to provide preferential treatment to tenants, the company is offering a 10% discount on the first month's rent for various types of housing introduced by the company. As a result, there is a very crowded daily search for vacant houses. Those who need large houses for schools and hospitals can also specifically entrust the company to search on their behalf. Therefore, the establishment of the company has provided convenience to landlords and tenants in Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲Reputation of the Wei Ya Restaurant Cantonese cuisine is welcomed throughout the country, and businesses are competing to use this as their slogan. However, they only have the name without the substance, and therefore quickly become eliminated. These Cantonese restaurants, like mushrooms after rain, have reportedly closed down one after another in no time. The Wei Ya Restaurant on Fourth Malu Road is the originator of Cantonese restaurants. It has been open for more than ten years. The manager, He Yuechi, from Xinhui, Guangdong, has been studying cooking techniques for more than thirty years and has hired famous chefs from Hong Kong and Guangdong as assistants. Therefore, the cooking is fresh and delicious, and the taste is palatable, which is unmatched by mixed-brand Cantonese restaurants. As for the attentive service and low prices, it has long been recognized by all sectors. This is true Cantonese cuisine, worthy of being the best in Shanghai. Because of its genuine quality and reasonable price, it enjoys an exclusive reputation. Even in times of economic recession, it is still thriving and is not affected in any way. This is the result of the reputation of the Wei Ya Restaurant.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3 id="e164">Want Freedom, Yet Don't Want Freedom <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Shujian</p>
<p>In "Free Talk," where we "want freedom," Mr. Qifan is shouting "don't want freedom." His reasons: "Humans fundamentally will not have freedom," "We won't have any freedom," "Limited to a portion of freedom, what's the point of having it?"</p>
<p>But, not having freedom doesn't necessarily mean not having freedom at all, right? For example, don't the Japanese now have the freedom to invade China? Don't capitalist countries have the freedom to destroy goods and products? Don't the unemployed all over the world still have the freedom to starve to death?</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, absolute freedom certainly doesn't exist; but absolute lack of freedom, where would that be?</p>
<p>So, do we still "want freedom"? Or do we "not want freedom"?</p>
<p>If we "want freedom"; then, "do whatever you want." Pushing it to the extreme, I think it will be the same as what Mr. Qifan said, "China is ruined by too much freedom."</p>
<p>If we "don't want freedom"; then, "we must all conform to the rules." Pushing it to the extreme, I think people like Araki and Hitler are hoping we don't want freedom, so they can take the opportunity to rule China.</p>
<p>So, do we still "want freedom"? Or do we "not want freedom"?</p>
<p>My answer is: "Want freedom, yet don't want freedom." That is to say: the freedom we need has two aspects: on the one hand, it is "the freedom of non-freedom"; on the other hand, it is "the non-freedom of freedom."</p>
<p>In "the new society that will appear," everyone knows they are "a member of the community," and everyone is willing to sacrifice individual freedom to complete the freedom of the masses. This is the "freedom of non-freedom" that we need.</p>
<p>In "the new society that will appear," that kind of individual lack of freedom all comes from being willing. That is to say, we need the "non-freedom of freedom."</p>

<p>Living in the countryside for a little too long, one naturally picks up the bad habits of loving peace and laziness. In the past two or three years, not only have I been reluctant to step into bustling dance halls and theaters, but even gatherings of celebrities and banquets with friends have rarely interested me. In the days of youthful neurosis, I had an episode of disliking people and being lonely, and now, in my declining middle age, this ailment seems to have returned more powerfully. Recently, I have even started trembling in terror whenever I am among a crowd of people.</p>
<p>On the evening of June 4th, however, as a result of accompanying my nephews and nieces, who had just escaped from Peiping to Shanghai, for a casual stroll, I happened to be in the audience for the first public performance of the Spring and Autumn Society at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association. Although a sorrowful drizzle was falling outside the door, the audience seats were actually sold to about eight or nine out of ten. Looking around, I saw that those sitting there were all middle-class gentlemen with dignified appearances above a certain age. On this point, I felt that the Chinese people had progressed. The general public's view of drama was already different from what it was a dozen years ago, no longer treating it as just a sideshow at school parents' meetings. After seeing the performances on stage (I only watched a segment of the ending of the first play, "Plum Rain," but I watched two acts of the second play, "The Death of a Famous Actor"), the clarity of the dialogue, the naturalness of the actions, and the composure of the characters throughout surprised me at every turn. In these short years, drama has actually greatly progressed, progressing so much that it almost made me shed tears; because China's politics and social conditions have been going backwards step by step in these years with accelerating speed, and only this aspect, this small aspect of drama that has always been looked down upon by people in society, has uniquely and abnormally achieved its great progress!</p>
<p>After being inactive in the countryside for a long time, my connection with art groups has naturally been severed long ago, so I didn't recognize a single familiar face among the audience around me. Because my nephews and nieces were clamoring to go backstage during the intermission, I stepped backstage before leaving the performance venue. I didn't recognize most of the people backstage either. Around these young, enthusiastic fighters, I only saw a spirit of courageously moving forward. The old bad habit of trying hard to imitate the decadent lives of artists from the past has also been dispelled behind the scenes of this new theater group. After briefly greeting a few old acquaintances, I stepped onto the homeward road, shrouded in a gloomy drizzle. Sitting in the car, I was silently thinking, "China still has hope!"</p>
<h3 id="e166">Scenery <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Ji</p>
<p>The small ditch meanders like a snake, flowing eastward. To the left of the ditch is a muddy road. Perhaps because the area is sparsely populated, the wheel tracks of wheelbarrows from the spring rain are still piled up there.</p>
<p>The barley is ripe. Under the May sun, the south wind blows, and the ears of barley rise and fall in rows, like the waves of the Huangpu River at dusk. At the edge of the barley field, a cluster of dark wild trees gathers, vaguely sheltering a few dilapidated farmhouses.</p>
<p>On the uneven paths between the fields, an old farmer walks slowly, with a short pipe in his mouth. His tobacco pouch hangs down, swaying in front of his chest with his unsteady steps. As he passes each field, he always bends his already hunched back, plucks an ear of barley, removes the husk, and puts it in his mouth to chew carefully. His face is stiff, without any joyful expression or trace of a wry smile, like a bronze statue that has endured wind and frost for a long time.</p>
<p>Following the paths to the left, for about the distance an arrow can fly, a paddy field cuts off the path. In this dry weather, it only takes a few sunny days for the water in the field to dry up. In one corner of the field, a yellow ox is pulling the wooden wheel of a waterwheel slowly, step by step, seemingly slacking off. He waves his hand absentmindedly and shouts, and the ox arches its back in surprise, raises its tail straight, and quickly quickens its pace, but after pulling less than two laps, it slows down again. He sighs, squats down, and sits on a mound of earth. The gurgling sound of flowing water echoes in the silent air, and he feels very peaceful in his heart.</p>
<p>On the path across the river, a foreigner in hunting clothes walks out, the nickel-plated barrel of his gun flashing in his large palm. A hunting dog follows closely behind him, its nose to the ground, sniffing vigorously.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he crouches down, secretly jumps behind a pile of mounds, and quietly raises his gun. In the dense leaves of a large tree nearby, a turtle dove is hiding.</p>
<p>Bang! A gunshot!</p>
<p>The hunting dog rushes over, but only finds empty space. The turtle dove has already escaped and is standing far away on the frame of the waterwheel. The hunting dog looks back in surprise, watching its master.</p>
<p>The hunter doesn't seem disappointed at all, and stealthily tracks it, then raises his gun again. "Hey!" The farmer sitting on the mound, seeing the hunter's gun pointed at the waterwheel, afraid of hurting his ox, quickly waves his pipe in the air a few times.</p>
<p>The foreigner only glances at him arrogantly, still focusing his gaze on the turtle dove's abdomen.</p>
<p>The farmer becomes even more anxious and rushes over hastily.</p>
<p>At that moment, bang!</p>
<p>The hunting dog bravely rushes across the river. Just as its two front paws grasp the grass roots on the bank, a dark shadow falls in front of it. It rolls over alertly and falls into the water, followed by drops of bright red blood rain from the sky, staining its clean fur.</p>
<h3 id="e167">### Turtle Dove <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Guangxi</p>
<p>It's raining again, and the turtle dove is always calling on the corner of the roof.</p>
<p>It is said that on such rainy days, the turtle dove is not happy to be calling. In fact, its call is lamenting. Every time it's cloudy, it will emit a strange, unbearable odor, and Mrs. Turtle Dove, when she can no longer bear it, has to peck it with her long beak, driving it out of the nest. So when it rains, the turtle dove, suffering from its wife's oppression, has no home to return to and flies in the rain, calling on the corner of the roof. "Coo-coo! Coo-coo!" This is its sad lament!</p>
<p>But who can sympathize with it? On this gloomy rainy day, everyone feels depressed. The rain confines people to their houses, preventing them from seeing friends, and preventing friends from seeing them. So people hate the rain, and even hate the melancholy, annoying calls on the corner of the roof, "Coo-coo! Coo-coo!"</p>
<p>"It's really getting into people's heads," one person says. "If I listen to it any longer, I'll go crazy." Another person says. Yes, who can forgive it for being forced out by its wife to lament? Everyone throws stones at it, and so Mr. Turtle Dove has to swallow his anger and fly elsewhere.</p>
<p>Water flows down from Mr. Turtle Dove's neck and wings. He has to stop on another corner of the roof. He still wants to lament and make the "coo-coo" sound. But being attacked and cursed is his fate, and he is stoned everywhere. No one pities him or sympathizes with him. Such a lament is simply annoying. Whether you were forced out by your wife or not, if you suffer, you are not allowed to cry. You only deserve to close your bird mouth and endure the suffering, flying in the wind and rain until the sky clears!</p>
<p>But when will it clear up? This long, lingering plum rain season!</p>
<h3 id="e168">### Carrot Whiskers <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— By Julen Kenato, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Godfather (Continued)</p>
<p>"The most important thing is to wait until your bobber sinks three times before lifting the fishing rod," he said to Carrot Whiskers.</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers: Why three times?</p>
<p>Godfather: The first time doesn't mean anything: the fish gently nibbles at the hook. The second time, it's no longer a game: the fish swallows the hook. The third time, it's very reliable: the fish can no longer escape. We must never lift it too late.</p>
<p>But Carrot Whiskers liked to fish for river sand fish the most. He took off his shoes, jumped into the water, and stirred the sandy bottom with his feet, making the water muddy. The river sand fish were startled and scurried around, and Carrot Whiskers cast his rod and caught another one. Carrot Whiskers called out to the Godfather, too busy to keep up:</p>
<p>"Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen..."</p>
<p>The Godfather saw that the sun was overhead, so they went back to have lunch together. He desperately stuffed broad beans into Carrot Whiskers' stomach.</p>
<p>"I don't think there's anything better than broad beans," he said to Carrot Whiskers, "but I have to cook them until they're mushy before I eat them. Gnawing on an uncooked broad bean is like chewing a bullet under the wing when eating chicken, making a sound, which is even more uncomfortable than biting on the iron of a pickaxe."</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers: The broad beans we're eating now melt in your mouth. The broad beans Mom usually cooks aren't very bad. But they're not the same as what we're eating now. She doesn't season the broth well enough.</p>
<p>Godfather: You rascal, I feel so happy watching you eat. I dare say you never ate as much as you could at your mother's.</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers: It all depends on her appetite. If she's hungry, then I can eat a little more too. Because when she takes some for herself, she gives me a little extra. If she doesn't take any for herself, then I'm done for too.</p>
<p>Godfather: But you can ask her for more, you dummy!</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers: It's easy to say that, Old Man. I'd rather go hungry than ask her.</p>
<p>Godfather: And me, without children, I'd be willing to let a monkey lick my butt if that monkey was my child! You guys should sort this out.</p>
<p>After the meal, they went all the way to the vineyard. Carrot Whiskers sometimes watched his Godfather work, following closely behind, and sometimes slept on a bunch of grapevines, looking at the sky with some willow buds in his mouth.</p>
<p>Spring Water</p>
<p>Sleeping with the Godfather was something he really dreaded. The room was very cold, and the feather bed was terribly hot. The Godfather's aging limbs felt the warmth of the down, making the boy sweat all over. But he was happy that he could sleep far away from his mother.</p>
<p>"So she scares you to death?" the Godfather asked.</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers: You'd better say I don't scare her enough. When she wants to teach my brother a lesson, he grabs a broom and stands in front of her without moving. I can swear to you: she stops immediately. Therefore, she prefers to move him with emotion. She says Felix's disposition is so easily moved that people don't need to hit him. Hitting is more suitable for my disposition.</p>
<p>Godfather: You should try taking a broom too, Carrot Whiskers.</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers: Ah! If only I dared to do it! Felix and I often fight, sometimes playfully, sometimes seriously. I'm as strong as him. I can resist him as well. But if I take a broom to hit Mom, she'll definitely think I'm giving it to her. The broom will fall from my hand into hers, and maybe she'll even say thank you to me before she hits me.

<p>Guangzhou Zhongda Education Research Institute</p>
<p>Hires Italian Scholar to Lecture in China</p>
<p>▲Recently Published Several Series of Books</p>
<p>▲Subsidies for Graduate Students Next Year</p>
<p>The Education Research Institute of National Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou has been established for more than five years and has achieved remarkable results. It is now reported that the Italian government is willing to donate a lectureship, and it has been agreed to hire Professor Xiang Di'er, the first Minister of Education in Mussolini's cabinet, who established the foundation of the new Italian education system, to lecture in China. Professor Xiang Di'er was originally a professor of philosophy at the University of Rome. The philosophy he created has become a school of its own and is highly regarded by scholars in Europe and the United States. He served as Minister of Education for five years, and the current Italian education system can be said to have been created by him. He is currently in charge of compiling the Italian Encyclopedia. Professor Zhuang Zexuan, director of the institute, traveled to Europe last summer and had two in-depth conversations with him. This time, the Italian consul in Hong Kong sent a letter inviting him, and it is expected that he will come to China. In addition to lecturing in Guangzhou, he may also need to give public lectures in other places. It is also reported that among the series of books published by the institute recently, there are "European Secondary Education." Those in printing include "Research on Secondary School Affairs," "Research on Secondary School Libraries and Scientific Equipment," and "European New Education." Three types will be sent to the printer, including "Comparative Theory of Political Education in Various Countries," "The Technology of Studying," and "Historical Teaching in Various Countries." All are published by Minzhi Bookstore. As for Ms. Bao, a British graduate student at the institute, she has completed the investigation of the status of normal education in various provinces, and the materials are being organized. It is heard that the institute plans to recruit five graduate students in Shanghai, Beiping, and other places next year, and each student will be given a subsidy of 600 yuan to encourage them. Application guidelines will be sent upon request.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Grand Opening of the Chinese Painting Exhibition Organized by Xu Beihong in France <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese painting exhibition organized by Xu Beihong opened in France on May 10th, which can be regarded as the beginning of Chinese art exhibitions in Europe. The French had been eagerly anticipating this event. After Mr. Xu arrived in France, many famous French people went to his home every day to ask to see the paintings, praising them and returning home, competing to publish them in newspapers. At the opening ceremony, the French, from the Minister of Foreign Affairs down to artists and writers, attended in countless numbers. Although it was pouring rain that day, the attendees were extremely crowded. Even the opening of the most important Spring Salon exhibition in France was not so grand. Chinese people, from Minister Gu down, flocked to watch, also gathered together.</p>
<p>The artworks were displayed in six rooms, each room was full, and the doors were almost impassable. Fortunately, the French were very orderly and proceeded in order, otherwise it would have been unimaginable. The Figaro newspaper immediately published the best comments from the world's greatest critics. The French like to use handheld glasses to view paintings, and some even use telescopes. After using the mirrors, they put them down and sat down to watch, observing from near and far, carefully studying each piece for a very long time. As soon as they saw a Chinese person, they shook hands and asked for their name and the author's name, age, and living conditions. Even though the catalog contains detailed information, they are still so concerned. The French know more about painting than the Chinese, and they may not know as much about China as the Chinese do, but they are extremely interested in Chinese painting this time. After watching, they expressed extra respect and warmth for the Chinese. Every time they saw a Chinese person, they said it was very good. They used to be proud, but now they are unusually kind. The painting exhibition has been very successful.</p>
<p>The viewers praised Xu Beihong's paintings very much and competed to meet him. Therefore, Mr. and Mrs. Xu were extremely busy that day, and some were unable to shake hands. News reporters gathered, some photographing the grand occasion, and some photographing Mr. and Mrs. Xu hosting. They were extremely busy. The tense atmosphere of the venue and the importance and kindness shown by the country on the opening day were already like this. Our country has given the foreign country a very good impression. At this time, there are many important French people in Beijing, and the future glory can be expected. The international atmosphere may be better due to this impression. The art promoted by our country with truth, goodness, and beauty is now shining in the world because of this.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center is extremely busy as the summer vacation approaches. Various schools have invited Mr. Pan Yangyao, Mr. Yang Chonggao, and others from the center to give lectures on further education and employment.

<h3 id="e180">First Sound of the Jiangda Baseball Game <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Traffic University Victorious Over Fudan University</p>
<p>|Result: 8 to 4|</p>
<p>▲Fudan scored a total of three points in the first four innings.</p>
<p>▲Traffic University scored seven consecutive points in the fifth inning.</p>
<p>Shanghai Chinese baseball, which had been dormant for a long time, saw the Fudan and Traffic Universities compete in the Jiangda Sports Association's baseball special tournament at the China Baseball Field yesterday. This marked the first sound of Chinese baseball, and a detailed account is provided below to whet the readers' appetites and demonstrate the intention to promote the sport.</p>
<p>(Analysis of the Game) Fudan University's strength was considered to be greater. Pitcher Gu Degang had powerful arms and good control, and catcher Li Changfang was also very steady. Fudan won the first four innings with a score of three to zero, assuming they could secure victory. Unexpectedly, in the top of the fifth inning, Fudan's lineup became chaotic and uncontrollable. Pitcher Gu Degang even committed three "four-ball walks", causing Traffic University's morale to suddenly surge, earning them seven consecutive points. Fudan suffered a defeat with a score of four to eight, which was a pity. The lineups of the two teams were as follows:</p>
<p>▲Traffic University Positions▲Fudan University Positions</p>
<p>Liu Youzhang 2nd Base Feng Chaoliang 3rd Base</p>
<p>Li Beiliang Shortstop Jin Zhendong Shortstop</p>
<p>Wen Liandong Center Field Gu Degang Pitcher</p>
<p>Shen Guanlan 1st Base Li Yaohua 1st Base</p>
<p>Wang Changying 3rd Base Wang Shusen Right Field</p>
<p>Gong Yibin Right Field An Bingwu Center Field</p>
<p>Chen Gongxing Left Field Li Changfang Catcher</p>
<p>Shi Shouyi Catcher Wang Zhengyin Left Field</p>
<p>Wu Yingqiong Pitcher Zhou Qiqing 2nd Base</p>
<p>(First Inning)</p>
<p>Fudan started the attack first. The first batter, Feng Chaoliang, hit a single and reached first base. Jin Zhendong struck out. Feng then stole second base. Gu Degang hit a single past first base, and Feng Chaoliang managed to score, earning the first point. Li Yaohua's fly ball was killed by the left fielder. Li Changfang advanced to third base in place of Gu Degang. Wang Shusen went down without success. After the change, Traffic University's Liu Youzhang batted first, but the ball to second base was killed. Li Beiliang's fly ball was caught by the pitcher. Wen Liandong struck out and returned without success. (Fudan 1, Traffic University 0)</p>
<p>(Second Inning)</p>
<p>Traffic University's formation featured a wonderful "double play" performance. After Fudan's An Bingwu wrongly gained a base (due to the opponent's error), Li Changfang powerfully swung his bat, and the ball flew to the left field, where it was cleverly caught by third baseman Wang Changying, and Li was out. An Bingwu, who was on first base, was trying to steal second base when Wang Changying quickly sent the ball to second baseman Liu Youzhang, and An was also killed. Unfortunately, Traffic University's pitcher Wu Yingqiong was disappointing, issuing four walks to Wang Zhengyin. Coupled with the error at second base and the catcher's misthrow, Wang Zhengyin managed to score. Zhou Qiqing went to second base. In the next inning, Traffic University still trailed by one point. After the change, Traffic University's Shen Guanlan struck out, Wang Changying died on a fly ball, Gong Yibin reached base with a "four-ball walk", and Chen Gongxing was at a loss. The second inning ended. (Fudan 1, Traffic University 0)</p>
<p>(Third Inning)</p>
<p>At the beginning of this inning, Traffic University's formation was extremely strict, leaving no gaps to exploit. Fudan's Feng Chaoliang and Gu Degang were both sent out on fly balls. Li Yaohua made a desperate bet, staring intently, and swung his bat fiercely. The ball flew high towards the center field, thinking it would be a "home run", but Traffic University's Wen Liandong aimed it perfectly, rescued Adou, and quickly killed three people, which was extremely easy. After Fudan's formation, Traffic University also made no progress, except for Wu Yingqiong's "four-ball walk" to reach base. (Fudan 0, Traffic University 0)</p>
<p>(Fourth Inning)</p>
<p>Fudan's Wang Shusen reached third base directly due to an error between Traffic University's third and first base, creating a very good opportunity. An Bingwu hit a single and reached first base, returning to home base and adding one point. Li Changfang and Wang Zhengyin did not succeed, so the field was changed. Traffic University's Li Beiliang entered the field and reached first base. Wen Liandong suffered a loss, but due to Li's being killed, he managed to occupy first base. Shen Guanlan struck out, and Wang Changying also failed to make progress. The inning ended. (Fudan 1, Traffic University 0)</p>
<p>(Fifth Inning)</p>
<p>Fudan's three players did not score, and after the change of innings, Traffic University's morale suddenly surged, and their spirits were high. Fudan's pitcher, Gu Degang, on the other hand, changed his usual state, and his pitches were weak. He allowed Gong Yibin to reach base with a "four-ball walk". Chen Gongxing came on and struck a powerful blow, the ball was low and fast, passing through second</p>
<p>base, Gong and Chen each occupied first base. After Shi Shouyi was killed, Wu Yingqiong advanced to first base again, so all three bases were occupied, and the situation was tense. At this time, it was a critical period for the pitcher, and it could not be taken lightly. However, Gu Degang seemed quite anxious due to the cheers of the Traffic University players, and he issued another "four-ball walk" to Liu Youzhang. As a result, Gong Yibin, who was on third base, scored a point without effort. After Li Beiliang's fly ball was out, Traffic University had only one player left. If Fudan could closely monitor, they would not have suffered a major disaster. Who knew that Gu Degang would issue another "four-ball walk"? Wen Liandong also advanced to first base, and Chen Gongxing also scored, gaining two consecutive points. Traffic University was once again full of three bases. As a result, Fudan became more and more flustered, and mistakes piled up. One wrong step caused eternal regret, and Traffic University's momentum became stronger. Later, Shen Guanlan and Wang Changying each performed miraculously, and Gong Yixun even got a "double play". Li Beiliang (running in place of Wu Yingqiong), Liu Youzhang, Wen Liandong, Shen Guanlan, and Wang Changying also returned to score, gaining a total of seven points, defeating Fudan with a score of seven to three. (Fudan 0, Traffic University 7)</p>
<p>(Sixth Inning)</p>
<p>In this inning, Fudan all returned halfway. Wang Shusen reached third base, but was eventually killed and left the field. Traffic University's Shi Shouyi reached base first. Wu Yingqiong struck out. Liu Youzhang's fly ball was caught. Li Beiliang hit a single. Wen Liandong hit the ball, and Shi Shouyi scored, adding one point. The hope of victory became even more consolidated. (Fudan 0, Traffic University 1)</p>
<p>(Seventh Inning)</p>
<p>Fudan's only hope lay in this inning. They proceeded cautiously, hoping to expand their success. However, Traffic University's formation was tight and flawless. Wang Zhengyin and Zhou Zhuqing were out one after another. Feng Chaoliang hit a single, and Jin Zhendong followed. Feng scored, and Gu's hit was ineffective, only gaining one point. As a result, Traffic University reversed the defeat and won with a score of eight to four. (Traffic University did not bat in the bottom half of the inning.) The base umpire was Liu Dacheng, and the ball umpire was Zhou Jiaqi. The scores for each inning were as follows:</p>
<p>Fudan University 1 1 0 1 0 9 1 — 4</p>
<p>Inning Number (1st) (2nd) (3rd) (4th) (5th) (6th) (7th) ——</p>
<p>Traffic University 0 0 0 0 7 1 — 8</p>
<p>French International Tennis Singles Tournament</p>
<h3 id="e181">Crawford Wins Championship <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Defeats French Ace Cochêt</p>
<p>|British Miss Scriven Wins Women's Championship|</p>
<p>(Paris, 5th) In the French International Tennis Championships, the men's singles final was held. Australian player Crawford defeated French ace Cochêt by a score of 8-6, 6-1, 6-3. Crawford is good at defense. No matter what kind of shot Cochêt used, he was able to handle even the most difficult balls. Crawford also made Cochêt run around, so although Cochêt once led 5-4 and 6-5 in the first set, he was unable to maintain his lead and was defeated by Crawford. This time, the Australian male players, especially Crawford, have caused a strong impression among tennis players. The Australian Tennis Association, unlike what other countries have done, did not hesitate to add new players to the Davis Cup competition team, and their strength is formidable. In the future Davis Cup competition, Japan will definitely eliminate Germany, but when they meet the Australian team between the 17th and 19th of this month, they will definitely be defeated by the Australian players. On the other hand, the British team will definitely win the European final, but it is difficult to know who will win when they meet the Australian team. Also, the women's singles final was held at the same time today, and British player Miss Scriven defeated French Madame 　Diou by a score of 6-2, 4-6, 6-4, and won the championship. Miss Scriven is older and more confident, so she was able to overcome her strong opponent. (Havas Agency)</p>

<p>▲Disgust at Germany's Discrimination Against Jews</p>
<p>(New York, 5th, Havas Agency) The American Jewish Congress, due to the discrimination against Jews in Germany, sent a telegram to the American delegation of the Vienna International Olympic Committee, asking them to oppose holding the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. Twenty American Olympic athletes also signed the telegram. Previously, the German government intended to transfer the power to prepare for the Olympic Games to the Central Sports Committee, instead of allowing the German Olympic Committee to host it. The International Olympic Committee therefore protested to the German government. There are also rumors that the 1936 Olympic Games may be held in Italy.</p>

<p>▲Present Department of Education Order to Promulgate June 6th as Teachers' Day and Issue Declaration</p>
<p>▲Municipal Middle School Teachers' Union and Hangzhou and Zhenjiang Hold Meetings</p>
<p>|Municipal Elementary Schools|</p>
<p>Yesterday was Teachers' Day. The teachers and staff of the municipal schools in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts of the city held a celebration ceremony at 2 PM at the auditorium of Yangzheng Elementary School in the city, and classes were suspended for half a day in commemoration. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲The participating schools included Xinmin, Junyi, Pengnan, Chaozong, Wanzhu, Wuben, Shangwen, Shihua, Xicheng, Meixi, Danhua, First Experimental Elementary School, Tangwan, Bide, Hean, Xunyu, Nanqu, Gaochang, Nongtan, Nanxun, Feihong, 　Bridge, Haishan, Minglun, Longde, Chengzhi, Zhongdao, Cangqi, Qimei, Jiangjing, Dongming, Chongzheng, Quanzhang, Zhangtang, Jingye, Yongxing, Juyuan, Junpu, and other more than 40 schools, with more than 500 male and female teachers and staff, as well as Superintendent Zeng Shengyuan of the Municipal Education Bureau, Shu Xincheng of China Bookstore, Principal Zheng Xigu of Provincial Industrial High School, and President Liu Zhanen of Shanghai University.</p>
<p>▲Celebration Situation: The meeting started at 2 PM. The presidium included Zhang Yongchun of the First Experimental Elementary School, Qian Xuanqing of Yangzheng, and Zhao Luqing of Xicheng. The master of ceremonies was Xu Yuchang of Bide, and the recorders were Xu Huizhi of Xicheng and Shi Baihu of Yangzheng. The receptionists were Hu Huaitian, Kong Yimin, Zhang Xiaotian, and Jiang Menglin. The entertainment organizers were Yang Songyu and Qian Cijiu. After performing the rituals, Chairman Zhang Yongchun of the presidium gave a report. Superintendent Zeng Shengyuan of the Education Bureau, Shu Xincheng of China Bookstore, Principal Zheng Xigu of Provincial Shanghai High School, Liu Zhanen of Shanghai University, Hu Huaitian, Xu Guanguang, and Chen Pinyi gave speeches in succession. Next, teachers and children from various schools performed entertainment programs. Finally, proposals were discussed, photos were taken, and the meeting adjourned. At 7 PM, a dinner was held at Dafugui to promote fellowship.</p>
<p>▲Chairman's Report: Chairman Zhang Yongchun of the presidium reported that the celebration meeting was initially initiated by more than 20 teachers at the first preparatory meeting on June 1st. The second preparatory meeting was held the next day, setting the location, time, and ceremony for the celebration, and deciding to hold it today. Zhang Yongchun mentioned a few points that were worth noting about the celebration meeting: (1) The issue of the name of Teachers' Day. Strictly speaking, the term "teacher" seems to be limited to elementary school teachers. In fact, when Teachers' Day first started, university professors, middle school teachers, elementary school teachers, and educational administrators all participated. But why not call it Professors' Day or Teachers' Day, but insist on calling it Teachers' Day? It is precisely because elementary education is basic education, and elementary school teachers bear an extremely important responsibility. (2) The origin of Teachers' Day. In 1931, educator Cheng Qibao and others felt the need for teachers to have organizations and connections, so they initiated Teachers' Day. At that time, the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Education, and other departments sent personnel to participate, but June 6th was not promulgated as Teachers' Day. Therefore, when discussing the proposal today, it was decided to formally request the Ministry of Education to issue an official order to promulgate June 6th as Teachers' Day. (3) The goal of Teachers' Day is to improve treatment, guarantee status, and enhance self-cultivation. The methods to achieve this goal seem to require careful consideration.</p>
<p>▲Summary of Speeches (1) Superintendent Zeng Shengyuan of the Municipal Education Bureau gave a speech, stating that past education could not adapt to the education of the present era. Education in the present era should focus on production education, and special attention should be paid to the national consciousness in elementary education. (2) Shu Xincheng's speech was divided into three points: 1. If economic problems cannot be solved, educational treatment will not be easy to improve. 2. If political problems are not on track, the status of education cannot be guaranteed. 3. Before treatment and guarantees are properly resolved, self-cultivation cannot be realized. Therefore, to improve the treatment and status of teachers, it is not something that education itself can solve. Education cannot be separated from society and exist independently. Improving society is the way to improve education. Therefore, teachers themselves should first enrich their knowledge and improve society. (3) Zheng Xigu's speech stated that: 1. The reason why education cannot be improved is that the educational economy cannot be determined. Therefore, determining educational funding is the most important issue. 2. Teachers should be professionalized and take education as a lifelong career. 3. The instability of Chinese teachers' lives has become a common phenomenon. To improve education, we must first seek to stabilize teachers' lives. National teachers should determine the minimum living standard and implement a single-level salary system, and compulsory group savings should be implemented. 4. Restore the inherent status of teachers, and the municipal education community should work together to realize it. (4) Liu Zhanen's speech stated that: 1. Teachers should have a positive spirit to seek the welfare of the country. 2. Teachers should have a spirit of practice and unite together. 3. Teachers should have a spirit of sacrifice to maintain 　　and maintain the country. Hu Huaitian and others also gave speeches, which are omitted here.</p>

Organize the Municipal School Teachers' Reading Club. 7. Organize the Joint Association of Municipal School Teachers in the Shanghai Nanshi and Zhabei Districts.</p>
<p>▲General Assembly Declaration: We are the teachers of children, we are the teachers of children in Shanghai. The schools, organizations, equipment, school buildings, environment, etc. where we work may not all be the same, but we all serve the education community of Shanghai. The work, grade level, degree, subject, time, etc. that we engage in may not all be the same, but we all seek the happiness of children in Shanghai. Because of our common goals and intentions, on this day of commemorating Teachers' Day, we have a need to propose several points for discussion with teachers across the country. Teachers' Day is a special day for our teachers, and we should promote and publicize it, and everyone should take this opportunity to celebrate it in a grand and lively way. However, is it enough to just have a lively decoration? In the past two or three years, the Teachers' Day movement has only been the voice of weak teachers and the fragmented expressions of sympathy from teachers, and there have been no concrete and definite commemorative measures. This is the issue of commemorating Teachers' Day, and it is the first point to be proposed for discussion with teachers across the country. "Unity creates strength" and "Unite to start something" are words we often use to tell children. However, how many teachers' organizations are there in various places, and how many organizations are complete and detailed? Some people say, "We organize the teachers' and staff union, nothing more than to fight for guarantees." May I ask, in addition to the issue of guarantees, do we not have other issues that need to be discussed and researched together? If there are issues to be discussed and researched, is there no need for a union organization? Do these need to be proven with facts? This is the issue of whether or not there should be a teachers' and staff union and what attitude the teachers' and staff union should take, and it is the second point to be proposed for discussion with teachers across the country. The world is constantly progressing, and academic inventions are constantly being made. If we do not continue to cultivate ourselves and study, our thinking and views will inevitably lag behind. Especially in today's China, production science is lagging behind everywhere. If we do not catch up, how can we improve the international status of our motherland? To cultivate ourselves and study, what kind of method should we adopt? How can we make it a reality and not just empty talk? This is the issue of the self-improvement of our teachers, and it is the third point to be proposed for discussion with teachers across the country. Scientific inventions have made human life more complex day by day. Our teachers, who are in a position to lead children everywhere, do not need to seek to be superior in everything in terms of enjoying modern civilization, but they should also maintain a position above the horizontal line. This is the issue of improving the welfare of teachers themselves. During the national crisis, everyone should endure hardship. It is difficult to improve, and it is not easy to maintain. What kind of living standard should teachers take? This is the fourth point to be proposed for discussion with teachers across the country. The above issues are directly related to our teachers, and they are the more important of the directly related issues. How should our teachers across the country strive to encourage themselves, so that each issue can be adequately resolved, to increase the vitality of our education community, to increase the interest of our teachers, so that the education community can open up a new situation and have a new way out?</p>
<p>▲Teachers' Dinner: At 7 PM, a dinner was held at Dafugui, and more than 200 teachers and staff attended. Director Pan rushed over from Jinan University and gave a speech on the spot, mentioning three points: (1) The relationship between teachers and students now is not as strong as it was in the old private school era. Now, on the occasion of Teachers' Day, we should find ways to restore and enhance the relationship between teachers and students, and make people in society respect teachers. (2) Just now I heard the chairman report that many resolutions were made at today's commemorative meeting, such as organizing a reading club, which is very valuable. There are too many bad environments for children now. The effect of education is fleeting. If we can actively promote good education in terms of children's reading materials, movies, and broadcasting, and break through the line of defense against bad environments, it is truly an urgent task for teachers at present. (3) Teachers' and staff groups should expand their organizations and do valuable work, which is also very necessary. Please allow me to raise a glass to wish you all the best.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Watching Dragon Boats Beside the Worry-Free Temple <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The grand dragon boat races I had only heard of but never seen. The dragon boat rowing in both the northern and southern canals has various names: "blocking head oar," "making victory meeting," and "emerging water ascending head," all passed down from the elders. These grand events were before the Taiping Rebellion; back then, resources were abundant, and people did not see war. By the Dragon Boat Festival, the common people naturally had the chance to witness such spectacles. Now, with the economy sluggish and the national crisis severe, even the Dragon Boat Festival is being eliminated, let alone dragon boats? It seems we are not destined to witness such sights.</p>
<p>Some say that while the Dragon Boat Festival can be eliminated, dragon boats should be promoted. Although they are a form of entertainment, they contain the spirit of water sports. I say: that's right, haven't you seen Guangzhou playing dragon boats on a grand scale? I saw recent Cantonese newspapers reporting on dragon boats, and it felt as if I could hear the sound of gongs and drums between the lines. On that day, everyone in the city emptied their houses to watch the dragon boats. The most bustling places, such as Lizhi Bay in the western suburbs and the banks of Ma Yong near Jili Ji Bridge, were packed with people. Delicate modern women, school children wearing sachets, shop staff calling out to friends, and wealthy merchants hiring painted boats and purple-sailed vessels all chanted in unison, "Let's go watch the dragon boats." It's probably not "indulging in trivialities and losing one's ambition." To put it more elegantly, it's called encouraging enthusiasm for water sports.</p>
<p>There are three to five dragon boats racing together, seven to eight racing together, and more than ten racing together. As they paddle back and forth, endless supplies of wine, meat, and trophies are awarded, giving many people something to eat and something to take home. In front of the Worry-Free Temple on the Henan side, in particular, the strong swimmers exert themselves to the fullest. Even though the weather is not cooperating at noon, the light rain cannot disperse the tourists. The Haizhu Bridge is still crowded with people. Being wet on the head is like taking a shower under a cold water tap; what's the harm?</p>
<p>Logically, watching dragon boats beside the Worry-Free Temple should mean being carefree. Who would have thought that the old saying "extreme joy begets sorrow" would come true! At that time, more than thirty dragon boats from villages such as Dashizhuang, Litang, and Datang circled several times around the Ma Yong Bridge area. The spectators on the bridge were too enthusiastic and collapsed a part of the bridge, causing more than twenty men and women to fall into the water simultaneously. In the end, only a dozen injured people were rescued. Others, who had been greedy for the spectacle, suffered the misfortune of drowning! Qu Yuan did not endure loneliness, and gained a few comrades. This is truly a depressing event.</p>

<p>— Bai He</p>
<p>Young ladies who never left their boudoirs now have their sleeves high, their heels high, and go to the office and writing room every day. They hold their chests high, competing with men for a day's dominance, and looking down their noses, they no longer put stinky men in their eyes. Women serve society, and are superior in every way, frightening each of the two hundred million men by three inches. Look, for the sake of "promoting women's careers," male employees are smashing their rice bowls in batches, suffering in silence, with no place to complain. Oppose this, and you will be scolded for not understanding the great principle of women's service in the 20th century, truly a blockhead. If you claim to be modern, unwilling to be left behind, and still stroke your gray beard, talking about women's service, then I'm sorry, you have to give your place at the table to women, there is no other way.</p>
<p>Neither left nor right is appropriate. In this day and age, it is difficult to be a man. "I can't do it, brother," if you can't do it as a brother, then it's better to be a sister, and someone will say "I love you." Not being a man, but being a woman, not to mention anything else, just by placing a "seeking spouse" advertisement in the newspaper, without boasting, twenty or thirty pink envelopes of considerate, tender, and affectionate responses are almost guaranteed to arrive in a day. This will truly make stinky men who post "marriage wanted" ads and receive jokes, ridicule, and sarcasm seethe with rage, with one Buddha being born and two Buddhas entering nirvana, and what about three Buddhas? It cannot be investigated.</p>
<p>Oh God, I am a man, this life is over, so I desperately prepare to knock through one hundred and twenty wooden fish in this life, wishing to be reborn as a woman in the next life, using several free, obligatory male servants to open doors for me, offer me seats, and add coats, offer attentiveness, and hold my pug. But I don't know if this stinky man with a face full of worry has the good fortune to transform from the Cihang Taoist into the Guanyin Bodhisattva, which makes my seventeen or eighteen buckets go up and down, making me a little uneasy.</p>
<h3 id="e194">"Big" and "Small" <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Big people talk, if they say something wrong, let it pass. Little people talk, if they say something wrong, they get spanked." This describes how easy it is to be big and how difficult it is to be small. No matter where you are, as long as you are big, you will always get some advantage.</p>
<p>For example: in the officialdom, if you are a big official, then you can say whatever you want, even if you fart, who dares to pinch their nose and say it smells bad? Otherwise, if you are a small official like a sesame seed, then when you see your superior, you call them "Sir" in every sentence, not only must you be careful with your words, but your manners must also be impeccable. For example: in the business world, if you are a big partner, then your every move is unrestricted, and the owner entrusts you with full authority. Even if you don't speak reasonably to the employees and don't act according to human feelings, unless the junior partner is a "fool," who dares to interrupt and say "no"? Otherwise, please leave, I don't need you.</p>
<p>For example: in the family, if there are several brothers, if you are the "eldest brother," and if you are lucky, "your father" lives and works like a horse, earning a "family fortune," and when he passes away, "alas," "dies peacefully," then, when the brothers divide this "family fortune," of course, it is more advantageous for you to be the eldest brother, and you can get a little more. The smaller the ranking, the less you get. As for "wives," it is also more advantageous to be the big one and disadvantageous to be the small one, because the small wife has to live in a small house. Even if she gets to live with the big wife in a big mansion, then in every place, she must rely on the big wife. Otherwise, there is no way, she still has to live in a small house. As I write this, I still want to keep writing, or someone will say: Okay, let's stop, according to what you say, as long as you are big, it is always easy and advantageous. If you are small, it is always difficult and disadvantageous. Then, why is our Republic of China, a big country, being eaten by a small country like Japan? I say: this can only be attributed to fate, there is nothing to say!</p>

<p>Now that he saw him, he felt all kinds of emotions: sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy. He deliberately put on a smile and said: There is nothing else, but I have some unfortunate news to tell Madam Yang, which is that I am afraid people will say that I am relying on my brother for food, so I have already resigned from my job. Now I am taking my luggage, leaving the family, and going to the city to look for a job. Zhao Ziqiang did not know what his intention was, and felt that this person still had some ambition, so he said: Where will Mr. Gan be staying in the city? Ji Zhixin thought, it would be good to let him know his address, if he told Guizhi, and if Guizhi agreed to my proposal, he would definitely come to the city to find me. So he said: I am now a poor scholar, of course I cannot afford to stay in a hotel, and I do not want to disturb my friends, I will be staying in the Chuandong Guildhall. When Commander Zhao comes to the city, he can stop by and visit me. After speaking, he took off his hat, nodded, and left. Zhao Ziqiang did not know that he and Guizhi had developed love, and he would never have dreamed of the love triangle. He thought that he came to tell him that he had lost his job, or to beg for sympathy, but he did not know that it was a fit of pique. When it was time that day, he did not wait for the Jiang family mother and daughter to return home, and returned to the camp. The second time he came back was three days later. As soon as he entered the door, he met Madam Jiang in the front yard. After greeting her, he told her: Mr. Gan of the opposite house came here last time to bid farewell. He lost his job, did you know? Madam Jiang smiled and said: We are just ordinary neighbors, we don't have any dealings, his job is lost. As she spoke, she looked Zhao Ziqiang up and down. In her heart, she was thinking, why do you want to report such news to us? Probably Mr. Gan lost his job, and he is very proud in his heart. Madam Jiang thought so in her heart, but she did not tell Guizhi. She thought that Guizhi knew everything about Mr. Gan's every move. This time, let's not reveal it and see if Guizhi knows or not.

<p>Zhou Shaofu Died Peacefully, Known Throughout the Country for His Good at Collecting Small Ornaments, Zhou Shaofu, who was known throughout the country, passed away peacefully the other day. Zhou was uninhibited throughout his life and not good at managing his household. He devoted all his energy to small ornaments and also loved his drink. He was amiable and approachable, especially regardless of class and age. Those who knew him felt like old friends at first sight. Small ornaments after this, it is feared that continuers will become the Guangling Extinction Sound.</p>
<p>▲ The Traitor Hu Lifu is Dead, the traitor Hu Lifu, was changed from life imprisonment to the death penalty and was hanged in the Third Prison the other day. Before his death, he still made arrogant remarks, saying, "It is right for me to die. If the traitors within the country can be wiped out from now on, the country will not perish. However, what will happen to those whose crimes are greater than mine?" People are about to die, and their words are good. This statement is indeed credible.</p>
<p>▲ Dong Xiujia's Wonderful Words and Deeds, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, Mr. Dong Xiujia came to Suzhou the other day to inspect the Jialu Road. Someone asked Mr. Dong whether he thought Suzhou's position as a hub for Beijing and Shanghai and the importance of its transportation warranted an expansion of construction, rather than a reduction in the size of the Construction Bureau, expressing his doubt. Could it be that he was trying to seek relief in the future? Mr. Dong said that the provincial treasury was extremely tight and that austerity measures were being implemented to seek remedies. All provincial committees advocate for abolition, and there is nothing that can be done. If I object, people will say that I am biased. But from a practical point of view, if you really want to do things, even the original Construction Bureau is not enough. If you don't do things, even the existing technician's office is excessive. When he came to Suzhou, he went to Room 10 of the Railway Hotel in Changmen. Upon arriving at the hotel, he paid the room rate in full and hosted a banquet for Qian Tianpeng and others. He is an honest official under party rule.</p>

<h3 id="e197">A Trip to Fengming Mountain <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Daoyuan</p>
<p>Shangyu is a place where the Jin Prince Xie Lou hid and traveled, known for its scenic mountains and rivers, endowed with extraordinary energy, and producing talents. I had heard of its reputation but had not been able to visit. In the early summer of Gui Si, I organized the Shangyu Red Swastika Society and finally fulfilled my long-cherished wish. On the 28th, I made an appointment with my colleagues to visit Fengming Mountain. The mountain is more than ten miles south of the city. At first, I did not know how far it was, but as we went, it became further and further. The stone path wound around like the Yellow River's nine bends. The peaks were all tall and embraced the clouds. The sound of water was trickling by the roadside, and the scenery was secluded. When we reached the foot of the mountain, we looked up at the layers of stone steps, lush trees, and misty clouds. A high pavilion emerged, as if in mid-air, impossibly high. My fellow travelers all wanted to retreat, but I, at the age of sixty, still had great ambitions. I mustered my courage and went straight up to the top, and I did not feel tired, perhaps because of my seated meditation practice? After reaching the top of the mountain, we sat on the ground for a while and followed the path into a temple. The temple keeper, surnamed Du, named Xinchang, was over fifty years old, neither a Taoist nor a monk. He was old and sick and could not serve guests. The mountain produces tea, which has a very pure fragrance. The mountain dwellers cook it to serve the guests. Those who are thirsty find it like drinking jade nectar. Looking up at the temple, the main hall has three bays, surrounded by six bays of buildings on the left and right. The temple has a Dream God Hall. Every year during the Winter Solstice, men and women who want to divine good and bad fortune flock here, staying in the buildings on the left and right to pray for dreams. The dreams are often miraculously accurate. The temple is named Xiangu (Fairy Maiden), and it is said that in the Han Dynasty, a fairy maiden rode a luan to this place. After the fairy left, the villagers built a temple to worship her. To the left of the temple is a waterfall, hanging from the mountainside. Its sound is similar to the sound of pine waves, with dragons roaring and tigers howling. All worries should be washed away here. Beside the waterfall is a stone cave, also named after the fairy maiden, which is the place where the fairy rested. The cave is deep, remote, and quiet, with only enough space for one mat. It cannot accommodate people, and its entrance has been blocked by later generations. As I was gazing intently, suddenly a bird flew and chirped into the stone crevices. Its color was green, as big as a magpie with a long tail. Its sound was different from ordinary birds. Brother Huang Jiwu said it was a qingluan (green luan), but I did not believe it. When I returned, I read the Silk Records, which stated that this mountain had a fairy maiden riding a luan that sang like a phoenix. She rested in this building, and the mountain was named after it. After the fairy left, the luan stayed behind, and some people still saw it. The qingluan I saw was smaller in size, perhaps a descendant of the fairy luan? We have lived in Shanghai for a long time, with its bustling and noisy environment. Our ambitions and thoughts are dim and unclear. Being here, worldly thoughts are dispelled, and the mind and spirit are refreshed. I think of the decline of the world, the frequent disasters in recent years, and the people living as if in a nightmare. We eagerly await the return of the phoenix singing in seclusion, but it is not possible. Now that the qingluan has appeared, is it a harbinger of the arrival of the phoenix bird? Therefore, I am happy to record this.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Returning from Songjiang <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Chuan Yizhi</p>
<p>Songjiang has two famous products: one is the yellow peach, as big as a goose egg, with flesh that is fresh, sweet, and delicious, superior to ordinary peaches; the other is the four-gill perch. It is said that they are both produced in the same harbor, with the perches at both ends of the harbor having three gills, and only those caught in the central harbor having four gills. Because of its unique advantage, it can survive for ten days out of water without dying. In the past, people used to present it to the imperial court as tribute. Su Shi's "Later Ode to the Red Cliff" mentioned "a huge mouth and fine scales, resembling the perch of Songjiang," which probably refers to this.</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Zhou established a New Agricultural Beekeeping Farm in western Zhejiang. This spring, he moved his hives there and invited me to visit him in Songjiang. Last Sunday morning, I took the train there. After getting off at Mingxing Bridge, I asked for the location of the beekeeping farm. The local farmers and women led me with enthusiasm and were not tired of talking. This is the innate nature of human mutual assistance, but it is no longer possible to find it in Shanghai. There are three beekeeping farms east of the city, but they are all temporary. Once the flowering season is over, they have to move again. The New Agricultural Beekeeping Farm established by my friend is one of them. The farm has been in operation for three years, with an investment of over four thousand yuan. It currently has about one hundred and forty hives, each with five to ten frames of honeycomb foundation. Mr. Zhou showed me the honeycomb foundation, and all the cells filled with ripened honey were sealed. The bees were buzzing and flying around, constantly going in and out. I joked to Mr. Zhou: "Who are these busy little guys working for?" He said: "They are preparing for the winter food supply, and also for their own survival. However, with human intelligence, we can use them to extract honey for profit. But in spring, there are chrysanthemums and purple vetches, in summer, there are tallow trees and sesame, and in autumn, there is buckwheat and winter loquat. By moving the hives to different locations, we never let them starve to death, which is better than simply exploiting them." I listened and remained silent.</p>
<p>The farm is about one kilometer away from the east gate, with fields stretching in all directions and clouds and water reflecting each other. The village women wrap their heads and go barefoot, either working in the fields or carrying firewood on the road. Who says that Chinese women are all parasites? From the east gate to the west gate, the street is about ten miles long, with shops lined up side by side, offering a unique flavor. However, the cloth shops all display Indian silk and foreign yarn cloth, which further proves that foreign goods are invading our country's market like water flowing downhill, and there is no place they do not reach. I cannot help but feel a sense of melancholy!</p>

<h3 id="e199">Financial and Gold Markets Pass Quietly <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The gold market was quite stable yesterday. There was a brief rise in the middle, but the result was flat. In the morning, due to the overseas silver market squeeze on the 4th and 6th, the British pound rose and the U.S. dollar fell. Exchange rates continued to show a slight rise. The gold exchange's forward silver prices and stocks both fell before rising again. The U.S. cotton squeeze rebounded by several points, which was disappointing. The raw cotton market opened flat. Bing Xingfen sold actively in the market, and Yuan Maoyong also sold on his behalf, reaching a price of about 39 yuan. The exchange market opened without strengthening. Zhifeng, Yongheng, and Yu all advanced. The Dalian gang smoothly purchased according to the listed price, and the opening was flat. After entering the market, the domestic market was tighter. HSBC's listed British and U.S. rates both shrank by 1.25. People's minds were more stable. In addition, the Guangdong gang Hengxing vigorously purchased, and simultaneously deducted U.S. dollars. The situation rose accordingly. The later market was initially flat. Finally, Bombay rose slightly, but the bank's appetite was weak and fell. The situation was mediocre throughout the day. Reports stated that the Ministry of Finance had borrowed 50 million yuan and used four-fifths of it to purchase U.S. cotton. However, the power was not great, and the price increase was not expected to be significant, so it had no major impact. As for the news that the U.S. president had signed the bill to abolish the gold standard, the raw cotton market was slightly lower. Speculator Luo (Yuan Maoyong) covered shorts of about 1,800 taels, and the difference price was increased by 65 yuan. The day's market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 937.5 yuan, slightly lower than the close of last Saturday morning by 0.2 yuan. Goods opened at 7.2 yuan. The exchange market also opened flat. The recent selling price was 1 shilling 3 pence 125 for British exchange and 25.25 yuan for U.S. exchange. People's minds were quite stable. Fuchang, Yifeng, and Yong came up to advance, and then rotated and rose to over 40 yuan. The September U.S. dollar was difficult to close at 9375. When Huabi and Anda made a pair trade of the September U.S. dollar at 875, Fuchang, Hengyu, Yiyu, and others successively advanced, and then rose to 44 yuan. Shanghai offered the September dollar at 8125, but could not rise further. Pangen then offered the same month at 875. Sanjing offered July at half a yuan. Daxing, Yongruixing, Yuanchun, Zhifeng, Eryuansheng, and others all sold, and retreated to within 1 yuan. HSBC's listed British and U.S. rates both shrank by 1.25. At this time, it hovered within 1 yuan. After entering the market, Hengxing came on the scene to vigorously purchase. Yuanheng Yongfeng also bought. The Guangdong gang was very active in settling U.S. dollars at this time. The August dollar was reduced from 6875 to 625, and then gradually rose to 4.8 yuan. The bank's appetite was still blocked. Citibank came out with the September U.S. dollar at 875. Chunyuan Yongzhengchang sold to within 2 yuan, but because Yuan Maoyong vigorously purchased, it was still able to support it. It hovered quite quietly. When Huabi bought September at 875, Fuchang Daxing Yong slightly purchased, and then returned to 4.8 yuan Fuyu sold the tael and retreated. Dongfang offered the Central Bank's latter half of June at 75. Daxing Yong slightly offered. The afternoon close was 942 yuan, and the goods were photographed at 2.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 942.3 yuan, and the goods opened at 2.3 yuan. After the opening, the bank ate the September U.S. dollar at 875, and Sanjing also settled the October dollar at 0625. Yuan Maoyong Qingfa Yong entered up to 3.5 yuan, but because Zhaofeng Chang Hengyu sold the tael and retreated. After entering the market, the September U.S. dollar was difficult to sell at 875. Yuanheng Hongli sold to within 1 yuan. Pangen ate the September dollar at 9375, and formed a spin. After that, Hengyu Yuan Maoyong and others once entered up to 3 yuan, but because the exchange market still showed a downward trend, Anda came out with the September dollar at 875, and Maijiali again blocked the October dollar at 0625. The goods Yifeng Yong Tongyi sold, and broke 40 yuan. Before long, the September dollar was willing to be offered by the bank at 9375. Yuanshengyong Yuanheng Fuchang also sold. Dadecheng vigorously sold without stopping, and then fell to 37.5 yuan. HSBC settled the September U.S. dollar at 26 yuan, and the closing price was 937.8 yuan. After the closing, there were also few buyers at 26 yuan. Fuyu came up to sell. The goods were further suppressed, and once retreated to about 6 yuan. Therefore, the goods were only photographed at 6.5 yuan. The highest price for the day was 944.8 yuan, and the lowest price was 37.5 yuan, with a difference of 7.5 yuan. As a result, it rose slightly by 0.1 yuan compared to the closing price last Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Because HSBC's U.S. dollar listing was reduced by 1.25, the revealed price was 24.875 yuan, and the combined standard gold price was 964.82 yuan. According to the closing price, it was suppressed by about 27 yuan, which was more than 4 yuan more than last Saturday. The current month's registration was 955 yuan, and June's was 942 yuan. The morning's supplementary water was 95 yuan, and the afternoon's was 951 yuan. The fried bare price was increased by about 65 yuan. There was a lack of formal transactions, and the market situation was dull and unbearable. The swap was also lacking in pair trades. No one in the market even asked about it. This was because the initial revealed price was close, and both the long and short sides had no interest. As of last Saturday, there were still 4,879 taels left in the current month's coupon.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was sluggish. The front market was more eager for demand, while the back market had a worse environment. It was difficult for sellers to find opponents. In summary, Hengxing Yuan Maoyong (speculator Luo), Yongfeng Fuchang Yiyu Qingfa Yonghengyu Yuantai and others all advanced. Bing and Ruixing Daxing Yong Yuanshengyong Fuyu Wanxing Shunli Dadecheng and others all came out. Yuanheng Yifeng Yong Tongyi and others advanced first and then came out. The Dalian gang Wanxing squeezed out more than 800 in the front market, and also squeezed out more than 100 in the back market. Shunli squeezed out dozens before and after. The Guangdong gang Hengxing bought more than 600, and Shen Kang advanced more than 400 on behalf of him (transferred). The total number of chips in July was 25,655.</p>

The recent selling price was 1 shilling 3 pence 125 for British exchange and 25.25 yuan for U.S. exchange. After the opening, it was slightly tight. HSBC's listed prices were revealed, and both British and American rates shrank by 1.25. After entering the market, it tended to tighten after hovering, but not much. This was because the Guangdong gang was vigorously settling the August U.S. dollar. The morning close was still flat, and the bank's appetite was inclined to close. There were not many transactions in the back market. Although the bank accepted it, the process was hard. Near the closing, it felt even more loose and excessive. It was heard that Bombay rose slightly by one anna. The closing price for the recent period was 1 shilling 3 pence 125 for British exchange and 25.3125 yuan for U.S. exchange. Compared with last Saturday, the British was flat and the American was slightly harder by 0.0625. The bank inclined to close in the front and settle in the back, but closed out extremely much. The gold industry both settled and cleared. The Dalian gang slightly closed, and the Guangdong gang vigorously settled, about 500,000 to 600,000 in August. The day's transactions are recorded below:</p>

<p>丨Banks Were Busy Opening and Closing丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, banks opened and closed, resuming their usual operations. Consequently, both Chinese and foreign banks were quite busy with receipts and disbursements. However, the commercial market recently has not been very prosperous, so there has been no significant demand for funds. Therefore, although receipts and disbursements were busy, they were not as impressive as before. Foreign banks received and disbursed 2,230,000 taels of silver in drafts, 3,340,000 silver dollars, and 6,560,000 taels of silver and 5,600,000 silver dollars in telegraphic transfers, export bills, freight advances, and special collateral loans. 800,000 taels of silver were released from warehouses.

Money shops received and disbursed over 44,400,000 taels of silver in foreign public drafts, over 8,500,000 silver dollars in cash transfers, over 900,000 taels of silver in remittances from various routes, and over 1,000,000 taels of silver in cash receipts. The market price for overnight interest rates had once risen sharply the previous day, but yesterday's market saw a decline. The morning market was only 9 fen, and the afternoon market was even lower, only 8 fen. Cash transfers also fluctuated with overnight interest rates, with no significant difference, also around 8 or 9 fen for draft transactions. Morning market transfers totaled over 4,700,000 taels of silver, with new transactions of 400,000 to 500,000 taels of silver, and afternoon market transactions totaled over 600,000 taels of silver. Transactions in the small general exchange totaled over 500,000 taels of silver. The total amount of bank note inflows, outflows, redemptions, and issuances was 2,230,000 taels of silver. Silver dollar collateral loan transactions totaled over 1,700,000 taels of silver. 100,000 taels of silver came from the Yangtze River region, and 300,000 silver dollars and bank notes were shipped from inland areas to this city. Furthermore, the Shanghai Clearing House exchanged 7,972,032 silver dollars, 1 jiao, and 1 fen on the 6th, including 5,152,414 silver dollars, 5 jiao, and 4 fen in silver dollars and 2,819,617 silver dollars, 5 jiao, and 7 fen in remittances.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Bullish Sentiment Emerges in Securities Market <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<h3 id="e205">A Small Rebound Suddenly Arises in the Bond Market <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>▲Cumbersome Accounting Procedures, Separate Trading Sessions Morning and Afternoon▲</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw a sudden rebound in public bonds, with strong recovery momentum. Due to extremely cumbersome accounting procedures throughout the day, only one trading session was held in the morning and one in the afternoon. As bullish sentiment emerged from various groups, market prices experienced significant fluctuations. However, short covering and bargain hunting were also quite active. The morning session opened late, starting at 11:00 AM. Initially, market prices were quite firm. 1918 Customs bonds rose 3 jiao, and Reorganization bonds rose 4 to 5 jiao. This month's demobilization bonds rose from an opening price of 64 yuan and 8 jiao, gradually increasing to a peak of 65 yuan and 7 jiao. At this point, major players suddenly sold off large quantities, and market prices fell from high to low, closing at 64 yuan and 7 jiao. The rapid changes caused extreme anxiety. 1919 Customs bonds opened at 48 yuan and 2 jiao, gradually falling to 47 yuan and 2 jiao. The significant fluctuations and the downward trend were due to strong buying interest, but the competition between bulls and bears ultimately led to a slight decline due to oversupply. Subsequently, various other bonds followed this pattern, decreasing by around 1 yuan each. Trading was extremely active. In the afternoon session, Reorganization bonds opened sharply lower by 2 yuan and 7 jiao, with a minimum price of 61 yuan and 7 jiao. The difference between the highest and lowest prices was a significant 4 yuan. Such large fluctuations and market volatility have been rare recently, but compared to the previous day, the price only fell by 9 jiao. The reasons for this include the emergence of bullish sentiment and the use of arbitrage by bulls due to significant differences between near-term and long-term contracts. Therefore, the long-term contracts only decreased by a small amount of 1 yuan, which was insufficient. However, 1920s treasury bonds remained firm and even slightly increased by 1 to 2 jiao, up to 5 to 6 jiao. As a result, they fell by 8 jiao to 1 yuan and 3 jiao compared to the previous day. This stable rebound often occurs after significant increases and decreases, which is a natural human reaction and often unavoidable. The total trading volume was 18,699,000 yuan, including 14,000 yuan in spot trading. Futures trading was dominated by salt taxes, accounting for 5,795,000 yuan, followed by 1919 Customs bonds at 2,985,000 yuan, 1920s Gan Customs bonds at 3,730,000 yuan, and other bonds ranging from 6,000,000 to 75,000 yuan.</p>

<p>New Fung &amp; Co. reported that the New York stock market on Monday (the 5th) resumed its bull market due to positive business news and firm grain prices. Railroad stocks and several special stocks rose the most, while others were relatively flat. Short sellers, who had expected a market correction, had sold short on Saturday and were now covering their positions, pushing prices sharply higher. Total trading volume for the day was 5,010,000 shares. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e207">Cotton Yarn Market: Morning Low, Afternoon Rebound <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rose, but actual demand remained weak. However, rising overseas cotton prices increased buyer confidence, and absorption remained consistent. Some believe that the agreement for cotton loans has been finalized, so there is no concern about future raw material shortages. However, weak domestic consumption favors short selling of long-term standard yarn.</p>
<p>(Standard Yarn Continues to Fall by About Half a Yuan) In the morning session, despite rising U.S. cotton prices, the market lacked buyers, and sellers were eager. Prices fell by 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8 jiao for each month. In the afternoon, market sentiment improved slightly, and profit-takers covered their positions, causing prices to rebound by 5.8 jiao to 1.3 yuan for each month. Total trading volume for the day was 63,350 bales. Major sellers included Da Feng (2,300 bales), Guang Feng (1,500 bales), Yuan Da (1,850 bales), Chang Feng (3,100 bales), Yong Da (1,200 bales), Yi Da (1,400 bales), and Da Chang (1,600 bales). Major buyers included Mei Ji (1,500 bales), Chun Ji (1,350 bales), Sui Long (2,000 bales), Yi Chang (2,200 bales), Chang Feng (2,350 bales), and Hua Chang (1,250 bales). Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Closing Price Fluctuation Open Interest</p>
<p>June 19.37 Down .530 750</p>
<p>July 19.50 757 100</p>
<p>August 19.88 662 700</p>
<p>September 20.10 Down .759 550</p>
<p>October 20.19 549 650</p>
<p>November 20.24 417 250</p>
<p>Total 277,000</p>
<p>(Weak Spot Yarn Consumption) Spot yarn sales were weak. Total purchases by various groups for the day were estimated at 680 bales. Prices fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon. Purchases by various groups were as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 25, Inland 35, Ningbo 10, Tianjin 100</p>
<p>Xuzhou 10, Changsha 120, Counterparties 290</p>
<p>Market sentiment was quite weak in the morning session due to the finalized cotton loan agreement. Generally, floating long positions caused great panic, and selling pressure was strong, leading to sharp declines. However, some believe that inventory of old cotton is low, imported cotton cannot be delivered, and absorption still has a promising future, so confidence is lacking.</p>
<p>(Disparities in Zheng Standard Cotton Prices) In the morning session, selling pressure was extremely strong in the Zheng Standard cotton market, with a fierce market sentiment. Prices for the current month were called down by 3 to 4 yuan. Later, as major players bought in, prices gradually recovered. As a result, prices for each month fell by 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 jiao. In the afternoon, the current month rose by 0.8 jiao, and the long-term rose by 1.2 to 1.3 jiao. Total trading volume for the day was 159,300 dan. Major sellers included Chang Feng (10,500 dan), Chang He (3,400 dan), Yuan Da (2,700 dan), Chang He (3,400 dan), Yi Feng (2,600 dan), Shen Ji (3,100 dan), and Ren Feng (2,300 dan). Major buyers included Sui Long (5,200 dan), Da Ji (6,900 dan), Li Chang (3,900 dan), Heng De (4,300 dan), Yi Chang (6,200 dan), and Yuan Da (6,800 dan). Closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially fell due to speculator selling, but later rose due to strong activity on Wall Street and short covering. As a result, spot prices rose 20 points per pound, and futures prices rose 20 to 25 points per pound. The Bombay cotton market fell due to some long positions closing out. Closing market conditions were calm. As a result, Pinggell fell 2 rupees and 7.5 annas, Oomra fell 3 rupees and 2.5 annas, and White Rawkey fell 2 rupees and 7.5 annas. Liverpool and Egyptian cotton were both closed. The original telegraph records are as follows (dated June 5):</p>

<p>Silk Cocoon Market: Confusing and Fragmented</p>
<p>(High Prices for Jiangyin Improved Variety Cocoons) New cocoons have been on the market for five or six days in Changshou and Changjing townships in Jiangyin. Arrivals are quite abundant, and various firms are competing to buy high-quality cocoons. The price of improved variety cocoons is higher, having risen to over 40 yuan, while local variety cocoons are 31.2 yuan.</p>
<p>(Wuxi Silk Firms Secretly Increase Cocoon Prices) Cocoon production is still abundant in various townships in Wuxi, and silk firms continue to report openings and secretly compete to buy them. The highest price for improved variety high-quality cocoons has been secretly raised to over 50 yuan, while combed cocoons are 40 yuan, and local variety cocoons are 35.6 yuan.</p>
<p>(Scarce New Cocoon Production and Arrivals in Jiaxing) North cocoon production in Jiaxing is not abundant, averaging only 30% to 40% of normal years. The price of foreign variety cocoons is 40 to 45 yuan, while local variety cocoons are 28 to 32 yuan. Due to scarce supplies, preparations are being made to close.</p>
<p>(Changan Silk Firms Gradually Stop Weighing) New cocoons have been on the market in Changan for half a month. This year's harvest is still only 30%. The amount received by various firms is insufficient, only 20% to 30% of previous years. Various firms are gradually stopping weighing. The average cocoon price is 34 to 35 yuan.</p>
<p>(Hangzhou and Shaoxing Dry Cocoons Continue to Be Shipped to Shanghai) The Hangzhou and Shaoxing cocoon markets are gradually closing. The fresh cocoons received by Shanghai silk cocoon merchants have mostly been dried and are being shipped to Shanghai in succession. There are over 4,000 loads of dry cocoons, which are stored in the warehouses of Jiangsu, China, and Jiaotong Banks on North Suzhou Road.</p>
<p>(Rayon Sales Active by Sichuan and Hubei Firms) Rayon sales in Shanghai are active due to the promotion by Sichuan and Hubei firms. It is estimated that 32 cases of "One Tree," "Flying Eagle," "Peacock," and "Blue Ning" brands are being imported from Sichuan and Hubei for June and July futures, with prices ranging from 176 yuan to 157.25 yuan net.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai foreign firm tea market, the intent to purchase fine green teas from the Tunxi, Yuxian, Tu'an, and Tuzhuang regions, handled by firms such as Xiang Zhuang, Jin Long, Yi He, Xie He, Tong Fu, etc., was more enthusiastic than before. There was a particular development in the purchase of the tip-grade teas by the tea samplers. There were also many transactions in needle-shaped and pearl teas. Total transactions for green teas from various regions reached over 3,200 chests. There were also large quantities of Wenzhou Yushan Gongmei teas under negotiation. The green tea market has improved slightly compared to before. However, the intent of British merchant firms to purchase Qimen black tea has declined, and the situation is quite pessimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Grain and Rice Prices Continue to Fall by Several Jiao <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Arrivals were from over 40 sources. Su Tong japonica and South Port thick rice were selling normally in the local market, and the market situation was soft. The Chang region lacked goods and prices were stable. Merchants from Tianjin, Beijing, and Weihaiwei were purchasing Qingjiao, Songfeng, and Xilian thin rice in quantities of over 2,000 packages, but selection was strict. Therefore, apart from high-quality rice, which remained firm, the rest were discounted by several fen. Du Yang pointed rice was similar to yesterday, and Yin Bian Yuan rice was also unchanged.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were ships from two or three regions. Due to the clear weather, sales of white japonica were not active, and the market was weak. Arrivals of early thin rice continued, but it was not selling. Prices fell by a small amount of 1 jiao. Yang pointed rice was in high demand, while lower grades were soft. Du pointed rice was slightly stronger, while port pointed rice was stable and customer pointed rice was stagnant.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Hunan Machine-Milled Red Rice Rises Nearly 1 Jiao <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market temporarily remained stable. Sellers insisted on their prices, while buyers remained cautious, and transactions were light. For mid-grade and lower-grade goods, due to the weather, sellers were more willing to sell, but buyers were uninterested. Therefore, mid-grade and lower-grade rice was weak. High-grade rice arrivals and inventories were low, so the situation was different from mid-grade and lower-grade rice. Yesterday, high-grade Hunan machine-milled red rice opened at 8 yuan and 4 jiao and 2 fen, an increase of nearly 1 jiao compared to the selling price last week. High-grade machine-milled rice in the general market was still priced at 8 yuan and 3 jiao, with lower grades priced separately. Over 600 packages were sold throughout the day, going to Tianjin, Fuzhou, and inland regions. Hunan machine-milled oil was slightly cheaper, selling for 8 yuan and 8 jiao to 8 yuan and 5 jiao and 6 jiao, while lower grades were 7 yuan and 8 jiao, going to Wenzhou and Fuzhou. A total of 500 packages were sold. Small-grain foreign rice sold 500 packages, sold by the British firm Anli to Wenzhou merchants, still opening at 7 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Slight Turnaround in the Afternoon Market for Standard Flour <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, although wheat prices in the foreign market were reported to be high, the continued short selling by various factories and inland merchants, and the earlier cotton loan agreement, caused market sentiment to be very weak. All months were sold off, with long-term months being particularly depressed. November fell by over 2 fen, while the rest fell by small amounts ranging from fractions of a fen to 1.5 fen. In the afternoon, northern ocean wheat was bought at low prices. Northern ocean merchants were strongly purchasing spot flour due to the settled situation in North China. As prices fell, their intent to purchase was even stronger, purchasing approximately 100,000 bags of near-term and spot flour. Short sellers also covered their positions at low prices, and the market gradually rebounded. This month's closing price rose by 0.25 due to active sales of spot flour. The next month rose by a small amount of 0.5 fen, August rose by a small amount of 0.25, September rose by a small amount of 0.5 fen, October rose by a small amount of 1 fen, and November rose by a small amount of 1.25 fen.</p>

<p>丨Futures Rebound Slightly After Falling丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was very active. After the standard wheat market opened, continuing the previous day's decline, all parties were eager to sell short. Factories and inland producing areas were particularly active in selling. All months fell sharply, with small decreases ranging from 5 fen to 1 jiao. November was 2 jiao and 6 fen lower than the high price last week. In the afternoon, short covering and factory inquiries caused prices to recover. Closing prices for July were unchanged, August was down 0.2 fen, September was down 0.5 fen, October was down 0.3 fen, and November was still down 1.8 fen. Spot wheat continued to arrive in Shanghai. Old wheat opened at 4 yuan and 2 jiao. The second batch of new wheat arrived in Shanghai, with 130 packages of Puzhen wheat priced at 4 yuan, all dragged down by the standard wheat market, falling by approximately 1 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Strong Soybean Sales, Bull Market Resumes <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>The soybean market initially leveled out and then became brisk, mainly because continuous telegrams reported price increases, and factory purchases were quite active. Export merchants also raised prices, leading to a renewed bull market. Yesterday, the most transactions were in pushcart beans. Zhengyangguan beans were sold to export merchants at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, and 4 fen per pushcart, while factories purchased 11 pushcarts at 5 yuan and 4 jiao and 6 fen. Three pushcarts of Linhuaiguan beans were sold at 5 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen. Two pushcarts of Guide beans opened at 5 yuan and 4 jiao. Although transactions in other beans, such as Shayang, Dalian, and Andong, were few, they also increased by 3 to 4 fen. Due to reports of high production prices and scarce supplies, Minhang green broad beans were insufficient for Shantou and Guangdong merchants, and prices suddenly increased by 2 jiao. Over 600 packages of Yongjiang broad beans arrived and were purchased by Fuzhou merchants, and the market was devalued by 2 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Sugar Market: Coarse Sand and White Sugar Rise 2 Fen <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was slightly tight due to the increase in standard gold prices. The association's opening price for 24 coarse sand white ordinary grade was 20 yuan and 3 jiao per 200 packages, an increase of 2 fen compared to the previous day. 20 grade medium sand white was called 19 yuan and 6 jiao. 8-9 grade Dutch red KNG brand saw some transactions at the original price of 16 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Changxing &amp; Co. opened the Guanghua factory Lu brand at 20 yuan and 6 and a half jiao, Shou brand at 20 yuan and 5 fen, ground sand plus broad package at 20 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen, RA cotton white at 21 yuan and 6 jiao, and second-grade color at 20 yuan and 7 jiao, with transactions totaling over 1,000 packages. Some Chao merchants opened Chao Qing at 200 some packages in total, with Jiehe providing the Zhuang Qing price at 12 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen, and Yaouchang Defeng and other Huanggang Qing prices at 12 yuan and 4 jiao to 12 yuan and 1 jiao.</p>

<p>Last year's Haikou lychee crop was abundant and extremely cheap. The new lychee flowers and seedlings started well this year, but were greatly reduced due to wind damage. According to letters from the local area, the crop failure is now 20% confirmed. Output is only 20% to 30% of last year.</p>

<p>Tin Continues to Rise Sharply</p>
<p>Tin prices continued to rise sharply yesterday. A telegram from Singapore reported that there are no spot goods in the near future, and a certain tin merchant in Hong Kong is hoarding large quantities. Due to this extreme shortage of supply, market sentiment in Shanghai is very fearful. Standard tin continued to rise sharply, with small mine tin opening at 170 yuan, a further increase of 10 yuan. Dutch tin opened at 188 yuan, an increase of 8 yuan. Jianghua Hengdi and other tins also increased by 4 to 5 yuan. The strong purchasing interest from Sichuan and Shaoxing merchants and local factories is driving up prices, and there is a high probability that the market will continue to improve.</p>

<p>"Everyone can perform magic tricks, but each has their own unique skills." These lines are the opening remarks of artists on stage. Magic tricks are originally a set of performances. Whether you are Eastern, Western, or Chinese, no matter how well you perform or how unpredictable you are, you cannot escape some skills in your technique. If you do well, everyone applauds and praises you. If you do poorly, the audience will boo, and naturally, the artist will lose face. In reality, since it is called a magic trick, it is mostly fake, nothing more than a deceptive performance.</p>
<p>Therefore, the jargon of magicians says, "Magic has no truth. Reveal it on the spot." In reality, where would a magician be willing to reveal it? If they were to reveal it, it would be worthless. Therefore, what can be revealed are only some superficial things, and the content will never be revealed. However, since it is a magic trick, anyone can know that what they are performing is not real. Even if it is not revealed on the spot, believing it to be real is probably extremely rare, and there are probably no such fools. However, because they perform skillfully, they earn the surprise and speculation of the general audience, who say it is performed this way or that way. The benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom, leaving people in a fog, ultimately unsure of the true meaning.</p>
<p>However, there is one point that artists must understand. No matter how well you perform, everyone knows it is fake, knows it is a sleight of hand, knows it is a misdirection, knows it is a show of pretense. Everyone recognizes this point. However, even though everyone recognizes it, the artist still has to perform. Fortunately, the audience has already bought tickets and entered the venue, sitting under this stage, unafraid that you won't watch. If you watch, naturally you will pay money. If you don't watch, you will still pay money. You can only watch, sit under the stage dozing off, stretching your lazy face, and shouting that you're bored, which has nothing to do with us.</p>
<p>This is originally a customary skill of artists.</p>

<p>— Ye Wei</p>
<p>The dust of barbarian hordes rolls in and encroaches upon the borderlands,</p>

<p>The first emperor’s long-dammed mouth is like a river,</p>

<p>— Ping</p>
<p>I remember when I was five or six years old, although I had entered elementary school, it was an incomplete school. Generally, children in this place did not make any new discoveries. Every child followed the "gentle and refined" model of the teacher. After school, groups of three or five would choose a secluded and dark doorway to gather and begin telling stories. Stories like Sun Wukong somersaulting 108,000 miles but unable to escape the Buddha's palm; Zhang Fei riding a yellow mule, standing at the head of Changban Bridge, shouting and frightening Cao Cao's 800,000 troops into running away in terror; and the story of Lu Dongbin and the Eight Immortals crossing the sea—this type of unfounded, baseless tales were told every day until they were thoroughly memorized. Not only did the audience listen as usual, but the teller still felt more and more interested. At the time, it seemed like the dozen or so children in our village were not intelligent at all. If I heard a new story elsewhere, I would immediately return, gather everyone, and tell it tirelessly for several days. In addition, there were games like running factory walls, planting melons and beans, killing sheep, and jumping gates, all unsuitable for children's personalities.</p>
<p>After the Revolutionary Army established itself in the Yangtze River basin, the actions of children changed: lining up, blowing horns, and everyone carving a knife or sword. After school, they began practicing combat, abandoning the previous habit of not distinguishing between streets and alleys, drawing boundaries, killing each other, and hating each other. It reached the point where a child dared not freely move outside the boundaries. Even the stories they liked to listen to were about overthrowing warlords and overthrowing imperialism.</p>
<p>In recent years, even more progress has been made. Scattered children have formed teams, with flags, wooden guns, captains, commanders, and guards carrying cigarette boxes made into pistols to protect the commander, as well as detectives, etc. They call themselves the Revolutionary Army and call the opposing children midgets and devils. When they meet, they shout kill. Overthrow, charge, resolve, and report are all spoken fluently. They also give speeches and slogans. They commonly use stones instead of bullets to practice combat. Both sides agree on a time, find an open space as a battlefield, and at the sound of a bugle, they all start, and stones rain down. When someone is bleeding, everyone thinks they have achieved their goal, applauds loudly, and triumphantly returns. The children who are hit also find it interesting, wrap the wound with a handkerchief, and discuss the method of sharing the spoils with their companions, never shrinking back. They have to hide it from their families. Children's changes, in this evolutionary process, are constantly influenced by social suggestions. Children consider the social state's evolution to be novel and interesting, and its influence is imitated everywhere. In summary, we should dare to pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>1. From literary to martial.</p>
<p>2. From scattered to organized.</p>
<p>3. From stillness to movement.</p>
<p>4. From rigid to lively, especially in terms of thought, progress is really fast. The knowledge of children who are now seven or eight years old exceeds that of children who were thirteen or fourteen years old one or two decades ago. We must know that social progress is fast, and children's thinking progresses quickly. All of children's actions are a microcosm of the general state of society. If we want to improve the nation, then children's education is the first task.</p>

<p>— Peng Nian</p>
<p>Everyone says that youth are the future masters of the nation and the future builders of society. The transformation of a new nation, the construction of a new society, and everything else, all rely on the strength of youth to advance and develop. Therefore, it is said that the strength of youth can produce national wealth, and the strength of youth can expand social development. To make the country strong and society good, it is necessary to cultivate, value, and care for youth first. Although this is what is said, there are many people who do not do this, perhaps intentionally, but instead go to harm them. What is the reason for this? Look: "The newspaper reports that a certain youth committed suicide out of concern for the country, a certain youth committed suicide due to heartbreak, and a certain youth committed suicide due to being out of school..." These are facts that can be seen in the newspapers every day, and I don't need to elaborate. However, regarding those who commit suicide,</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Whether it is due to a flawed social system or out of free will, this is a question worthy of in-depth study. If the suicide is out of free will, then why doesn't the suicide victim say in their suicide note, "I willingly die"? Instead, they write, "Unable to achieve XX, I committed suicide." From this, it seems that most people who commit suicide are not willing to do so.</p>
<p>Is there any benefit to the country or society from having many suicides? I think not necessarily. Didn't I say earlier? "Youth are the future masters of the nation and the future builders of society." Since youth are capable of being the future masters of the nation and the builders of society, they naturally have the ability to do so and the shoulders to bear this great responsibility. Otherwise, would people call them that? If that's the case, then harming one youth is like harming a portion of the nation's vitality, and losing one youth is like losing a portion of society's strength. Alas! If the country does not cultivate them,</p>
<p>If society does not value them, it seems they have no reason to cherish themselves either.</p>
<p>You reap what you sow. In short, this is the result of a flawed social system. For example, "If a sailing ship at sea loses its rudder, can that ship remain steady? It will inevitably drift with the waves and will never sail on a straight course." Whose responsibility is this? This is naturally the fault of the helmsman. Isn't the relationship between society and youth just like this? Therefore, to reduce youth suicide, we must first reform the social system. Otherwise, all youth will follow the tide of suicide and drift away with the waves.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Various Types of Shanghai Beggars <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Chang</p>
<p>(1) Chasing "Piglets"</p>
<p>As long as you have sharp eyes, follow those modern couples holding hands and say a few words: "Young master and young mistress! May you be happy and prosperous!" If they are pleased, with her giggle, he will naturally scatter a handful of copper coins from his suit pocket, or perhaps a dime.</p>
<p>(2) Greeting Cars</p>
<p>This is a top-notch business that earns money without effort. As long as you occupy the territory of several large companies, large hotels, dance halls, and Western restaurants, when a shiny black-plated car stops, you quickly stretch out your arms and open the car door, shouting, "Young master! Miss, have a good trip!" The price is at least twenty cents.</p>
<p>(3) Lodging Complaints</p>
<p>To do this business, you shouldn't dress too raggedly, to show that you are a temporary down-on-your-luck from another hometown. Moreover, you must be able to write well with chalk and understand some foreign languages. It is very suitable for someone like me, a former elementary school teacher, to switch to this. However, the income is far less than greeting cars.</p>
<p>(4) Guarding Temple Gates</p>
<p>Guarding the temple gate was previously called "relying on the stone lion." Its target customers are exactly the opposite of chasing "piglets." Muttering "Namo" to the old-fashioned ladies of the eighteenth century, and saying a few words like "Accumulate blessings and longevity," you are guaranteed to be satisfied.</p>
<p>(5) Collecting Bridge Tolls</p>
<p>Those who collect bridge tolls are mostly newcomers who have just started out. However, even helping to pull rickshaws up the bridge, I heard that they can earn a thousand or eight hundred [copper coins] a day. (6) Eating Leftovers</p>
<p>This belongs to the enjoyment aspect, and the insider term is "摸蟹 [mō xiè, groping for crabs]". After lunch and dinner at various shops and households every day, the leftovers from the food vendors are usually a treat for the 三黨 [sān dǎng, three parties - beggars]. Although these dishes are mostly leftovers, with fresh fish, fatty meat, and seasonal vegetables and fruits, they can greatly satisfy the appetite.</p>
<p>Since being a beggar in Shanghai has such great income and such enjoyment, it is no wonder that so many young masters are desperately trying to crawl into their nests.</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a poor boy. My parents died when I was young, and I can't remember whose son I am. A Taoist priest named Feng raised me until I was eight years old. Later, his wife also died, and there was no one to raise me, so I lived in the open wilderness. Finally, a clerk from the Township Office of this town, surnamed Yu, took me to his home. He and his wife were both over forty years old and very kind. Since they had no children, they treated me as their son. But the clan objected, and I could not be named as a descendant of the Yu family, but only as an adopted son. Since I didn't remember my biological father, I took the surname of the Taoist priest Feng, and was named Feng. Unexpectedly, this spring, my adoptive father, surnamed Yu, died. His death was extremely difficult, and even the funeral was done hastily with the help of the clan. Although my adoptive mother is very distressed, she cannot bear to drive me away. Now the two of us are living a hard life. However, my adoptive father owed a lot of debts during his lifetime. Although he has two brothers, they are unrelated, and the creditors still come every day to demand payment. My adoptive mother cries all day long, and has nothing in her hands. The clan members can chip in a few coins to buy rice, but it is impossible to take out money to pay off my dead adoptive father's debts. I am only thirteen years old now, and I have no ability to earn money. If my adoptive mother is forced to death by the creditors, my little life will also be gone. I don't want to be a fourth son again, so I might as well throw myself into the river and die. Good-hearted sirs, what methods are there to save the lives of my mother and son! The poor child Feng Guxiang kowtows.</p>
<p>Editor's note: In this era of economic decline, it is very common for a person to owe some debts. Fortunately, this common phenomenon has been pitied by legislators. Now the laws of any country, including China, treat debtors in this way: unless they intentionally conceal their property with the intention of being lazy, then they will be punished; if they really cannot pay, then there is no guilt. Acts like cutting off flesh to pay debts are now prohibited. "Not afraid of the fierce, only afraid of the poor" has almost been tacitly approved by the law. If this is the case for one's own debts, then the debts owed by a spouse during their lifetime, and the debts owed by the person being inherited during their lifetime, can be ignored even more. You mother and son are now so poor. In theory, others should be afraid of you. What are you afraid of others for? Now, the Yu clan is willing to chip in a few coins for you to buy rice, which is very fortunate. You should now advise your adoptive mother not to take everything to heart; just eat yellow rice and dried radish, and try to add to your meals. You should invigorate your ambition, wait for an opportunity, know the sweetness and bitterness, to find a way out in the future. Finally, we hope that those who read this letter will provide assistance within their means.</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>"Mr. Gu, how have you been lately? It's been a long time!" "Thank you, thank you! Has Minister Su returned from Beijing yet?" "Not yet. Have you received any telegrams from him in the past few days, Mr. Gu?" "I received one the day before yesterday, saying that he will be back soon." "This is Mr. Zhang," Fifth Concubine introduced to Manager Gu, "He is my relative. I don't know if you've met before?" "Oh! That's right, he looks familiar..." Mr. Gu said. "We've met. Minister Su was the host at that party..." As soon as that party was mentioned, Zhang Wenbin felt very proud, because he had never forgotten the glory of being a host. At this time, Fifth Concubine felt very awkward, unable to be unrestrained, and Manager Gu understood that Fifth Concubine was no longer the former Miss Liu.</p>
<p>"So, you're coming from your residence now?" Mr. Gu said again.</p>
<p>"No, I bought some things and I'm just coming to get some petty cash to take back."</p>
<p>"Ah! That's great, that's great."</p>
<p>As he spoke, Mr. Gu shook her hand again and went out. Fifth Concubine sat in the car and went home. Naturally, she couldn't help but recall the intimate scenes of the past, but a hug from Young Master Zhang dismissed them.</p>
<p>24. Crime and Punishment</p>
<p>Minister Su had returned from Beijing four or five days ago. But these few days he had been staying at the Second Concubine's place. He came to this place for one night the day before yesterday and was very happy, but today it was very different. He walked in with a murderous aura, as if he wanted to eat people. Fifth Concubine naturally immediately greeted him and led him into the bedroom, but he became even more angry, slapped the table and pointed at He Xiang and scolded:</p>
<p>"Quick! You bunch of dogs! Go and call that kid Zhang out here."</p>
<p>After a while, Zhang Wenbin stood in front of him tremblingly, and he heard him burst out and scold:</p>
<p>"You kid! What are you? How dare you be so bold?! Get out! Get out!... Get out of here now!"</p>
<p>"What's this all about? Why are you so angry?" Fifth Concubine couldn't help but speak at this time.</p>
<p>"What's the matter? You still ask me what's the matter? How dare you shameless people ask me? Gu Shoujie will"</p>
<p>"He told me everything about you, is there anything wrong? You've lost all the hundreds of thousands of deposits in the Taiwan Bank."</p>
<p>"Hmph! What a great thing you've done!"</p>
<p>"There's nothing to say now, tell Zhang Wenbin to leave here immediately, leave immediately, hurry!"</p>
<p>At this time, Fifth Concubine was extremely angry. Seeing Zhang Wenbin retreating without daring to say a word, she became even more angry, almost shedding tears. She glared at the old man Su, smiled proudly, as if she was full of confidence, and said calmly:</p>
<p>"Okay, old man, you're bullying me now. You're embarrassing me like this, you know who he is."</p>
<p>"Okay, you're now in breach of contract. Do you remember what you promised me before?"</p>
<p>However, Minister Su couldn't show weakness at this time. He took advantage of a burst of anger and rushed out the door.</p>

<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Rationalized Divisional Organization</p>
<p>Is the Biggest Reason for Development</p>
<p>It is truly amazing that movies have made such great progress in such a short period of time. It wasn't long ago that large, rationalized organizations and the expansion of various equipment replaced the outdoor production studios under the sun and the clumsy glass sheds of the past. Now, major Hollywood film companies have built their own small cities.</p>
<p>Within the walls of each company, it is divided into several zones, with residential areas, industrial areas, commercial areas, etc., built under the intersection of short streets and flat roads for several miles. The equipment inside includes hospitals and schools, forcing children of school age to read for several hours a day, agile fire brigade stations, teahouses, and restaurants. In addition to this, there are vast production studios. There are several photography studios themselves, towering libraries, production departments, makeup departments, screenwriting departments, publicity departments, and other executive departments. Of course, the accounting department is also very important among them, and the police are naturally the most important equipment inside. Their duties are to maintain the order of road administration, pay attention to crowded days, crowd congestion, and guard and protect the transportation of money, especially when transferring to distant places. In short, their task is to protect the welfare of the entire film city.</p>
<p>The rationalized divisional organization can be said to be the biggest reason for the great progress in film technology. The results of research and experimentation have given amazing advances to lighting, cameras, sets, and sound, and have perfected various technologies.</p>
<p>A film must go through many stages, that is, the selection of stories, the allocation of actors, the setting of scenes, shooting, editing, and the technical cooperation of sound, to create a perfect "work of art." But there is a crisis here, that is, overemphasis on technology. "Clumsy technology can damage the film, but good technology has never produced bad films." (?) This is naturally the view of American Well-Made Plays, which only focuses on skill and ignores consciousness. Because it is not within the topic, I will not describe it further.</p>
<p>Movie Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e228">Review of "Stranger in Town" <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Stranger in Town</p>
<p>In the current situation where the world's finances are in extreme chaos and the economy is collapsing, the collapse of banks and the unsmooth turnover of stores have become a common phenomenon in various countries around the world. The United States is of course no exception, and it is the most obvious, especially when Roosevelt took office as president. Of course, this turbulent upsurge is by no means an accidental phenomenon, but the existing economic organization is approaching the final inevitable stage of collapse.</p>
<p>Then, the small shops in this turmoil will naturally suffer great sacrifices and are the inevitable result that cannot be avoided. Therefore, it is indeed a very good choice for the author of "Stranger in Town" to use this as the theme, and at the same time, this very special situation will inevitably be reflected in the artistic works.</p>
<p>But how does the author of "Stranger in Town" understand this fresh theme? Indeed, many small shops will implement price reductions or other deformed auctions at this time in order to recover costs, and large capital entrepreneurs will reduce prices and try their best to sell due to the surplus of industrial products, and even direct sales, penetrating into every village. In this way, the market is more chaotic, and the competition in business is more acute. Of course, small capitalists will not be able to support it for a long time, not to mention that all goods need to be wholesale in cash, and banks have successively collapsed, making it impossible to turn around, and in the end, they can only close down and even go bankrupt.</p>
<p>But there is also an unavoidable phenomenon in the middle, that is, due to the reduction of prices, agricultural products are sold cheaply, resulting in rural bankruptcy and a reduction in purchasing power. Naturally, this is a big contradiction. Even if commodities are reduced in price, will they finally not teach customers to compete for purchases? However, the author of "Stranger in Town" ignored these, and he thought that as long as the price was reduced, the rural customers would flock to it. At the same time, when old man Kleeshill's grocery store was in trouble, it was said that the goods were not enough, and finally a large number of goods were obtained on credit due to the relationship of the granddaughter-in-law. And can this revive it? Naturally impossible.</p>
<p>As for such a theme, although the consciousness is inevitably blurred, it is very good to perform it in the form of comedy. At the same time, the interweaving of love, although not very necessary, is not forced. However, the prologue fifty years ago at the beginning is a superfluous scene. Some jokes are repetitive and exaggerated, and at the same time, a scene of love talk also feels that it somewhat damages the mood of the whole play. There is also the last truck running rampant, which is also a boring old trick. In short, this is not a very successful work for the director.</p>
<p>However, the performance of the protagonist is very commendable. Being able to exaggerate in a burlesque without going too far, and being so natural and reasonable, is really rare. The supporting actors are also very appropriate.</p>
<p>I think this is a very interesting work.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Spring Love Song <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>The "Maternal Light" directed by Bu Wancang of Lianhua No. 1 Factory is the most noticed film by social figures and the entire film industry. The sound part of this film is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>There are three songs in this film, and "Spring Love Song" is one of them.</p>
<p>Everyone is willing to know the lyrics of the song, so let us introduce it first. Although there are only a few words in this song, the song is short but the meaning is profound.</p>
<p>Spring Love Song</p>
<p>Flowers are swaying with the green waves,</p>
<p>Birds are singing on the flower branches! Waves are reflecting the beautiful setting sun, people are whispering on the magnolia boat.</p>
<p>Your eyes shot into my heart, your caress healed my pain! The most precious thing in the world is love: Ah! Love is supreme. We don't want to be immortals, we only want to be mandarin ducks! Don't want to be immortals, only want to be mandarin ducks!</p>
<p>This gentle and tender "Spring Love Song" is sung by the beautiful little bird - Chen Yanyan.</p>

<p>— Tai Kang</p>
<p>The "Struggle", recently filmed by Tianyi Company, is a film that adopts the theme of rural areas, depicting the exploitation of the laboring peasants by snobbish landlords. The ending is the January 28th Shanghai Incident. The consciousness is very realistic. It is said that the film was completely filmed yesterday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Taizhong Film Company recently produced "Love Education", which was written and directed by Li Hua. The leading actor is Guo Peikun, a student of the 31st school in Hong Kong City. It is said that Mr. Guo is only thirteen years old.</p>
<p>The film after Tianyi Company's "Struggle" was originally scheduled to start filming "Dawn", but now it is known that "Dawn" will be postponed temporarily, and "Advance" written by Yu Sijun will be filmed first, but the protagonist is still Miss Li Xiao. It is said that the plot of "Advance" is a military patriotic film.</p>
<p>The debut work "Cracks" of Hong Kong Huayi Company, starring Xie Xingnong, has now been completely filmed, and the second film "Illusions" written by Chen Tianzong is about to start filming. This film stars a famous drama star and is directed by Jiang Baigu.</p>
<p>Tianyi Company's new film "Vitality" has been publicly released at the Capital National Grand Theater since the 4th, and the box office is extremely prosperous. It is said that it will be shown in Nanjing or Great Shanghai in this city soon. It is inaccurate for some two newspapers to say that it will be shown in Beijing and Great Light.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Asia Company's "Iron Horse East Qin" is a sound film. Although it has been filmed for many days, it has not been publicly released due to unclear pronunciation. A few days ago, Xue Yaozhang, a staff member of the company, came to Shanghai to discuss the sound recording problem with a certain company. It is said that the company's second film has been set to film Xue Yaozhang's "Father Returns".</p>
<h3 id="e231">Huang Yunzhen Sends Dragon Boat Festival Rice Dumplings <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Huang Yunzhen, who often plays the role of madam in Lianhua No. 2 Factory, is good at cooking and often entertains colleagues at home. Those who taste it always sigh, "It is enough to stop eating." Two days before the Dragon Boat Festival, Huang happened to be filming "Small Toys" in the Second Factory and brought more than a dozen rice dumplings. Li Lili discovered them in the makeup room first. Huang said, "This is for Mr. Lu!" Li said, "I'm very hungry right now, let me eat one first!" Unexpectedly, as soon as the package was opened, it was snatched up by all the actors in the makeup room. Those who ate it praised it as delicious, and those who were slow could only watch others eat. So, Huang smiled and said, "I'll send a hundred more tomorrow morning to share with you!"</p>

<p>Han Lagen is naturally blessed with a crying face, and can make funny performances and movements in films, so he can win the favor of the audience. His special technical performances include moving his scalp, moving his ears, and tilting his eyeballs to the left and right, separating, matching, and rotating them extremely freely. This kind of performance was seen in the "Morning of the Metropolis" directed by Cai Chusheng of Lianhua. Recently, Han has been practicing a technique that allows him to move his eyelashes automatically without moving his eyelids. This technique has been practiced in front of the mirror every morning for two months, but he has not yet succeeded in making his eyelashes move automatically without moving his eyelids, although the eyelashes did move automatically once in the middle, but it was blown by the wind.</p>

<p>Recently, Ruan Lingyu doesn't know what kind of vegetarian diet she is eating, and she is very pious about it. She has been filming "Small Toys" at the Second Factory for days, from morning till night. Her lunch and dinner meals are delivered from home. Even her daughter Xiao Yu does not touch any meat. One day, when the staff in the factory were having a snack, Li Lili took a piece of bread smeared with White Pagoda oil and gave it to Xiao Yu. Xiao Yu was about to accept it when Ruan Lingyu caught a glimpse of it and called out, "N囡 [nānnǚ, child]: This is meat!" So Xiao Yu retracted her hand and dared not accept it.</p>

<p>Director Sun's eldest son Tommy is fat and cute. Yesterday, when filming the rural scenery of Sister-in-law Ye for "Small Toys", there were more than a dozen village children doing various games in the village. Mr. Sun brought his son with him in the morning, intending to have his son join the village children in the performance, but unexpectedly, when he was dressing him up in the makeup room, he firmly refused to take off his shoes, change into ragged clothes, and dress up as a village child. Soft words and hard words were not heard, and if forced, he cried loudly. Sun scolded him angrily. Tommy said, "You hit me, I'll go back and tell my mother, let my mother hit you!" At that time, Lu Yexing joked to Sun Yu on the side, "You specialize in making plays that describe the folk, but your son refuses to go to the folk."</p>

<p>— By Xin Fu</p>
<p>Produced by German Film Company, Starring an Entire Cast of Female Actors</p>
<p>"Ms. Pei Bo! What kind of person is she? Why is that girl so infatuated with her?" She thought to herself, but she was unwilling to ask the smug clerk, so she exited the "dressing room," holding onto the staircase railing, walking down step by step languidly. Coincidentally, Ms. Pei Bo was walking up towards her, face to face. When Pei Bo saw Manilla's pitiful appearance, even though it was their first meeting, she couldn't help but feel a sense of affection. When Manilla reached her, she reached out and stroked her braids, examining her face for a while, and then asked, "What's your name? Are you new here?" Manilla answered her truthfully, and then they each went their separate ways.</p>
<p>In her disappointment, Manilla suddenly encountered this gentle and elegant teacher, and her almost dead heart seemed to gradually revive. Pei Bo walked upstairs, and she stood there alone, looking at her receding figure. Suddenly, a classmate patted her on the shoulder and gently asked her, "Do you know this teacher? She is the kindest of all the teachers, the Ms. Pei Bo that all the students in the school admire!" Manilla now understood. The heart and letters on the uniform were indeed so. Thus, her sorrow seemed to vanish into thin air, and a smile gradually reappeared on her face.</p>
<p>In the dormitory, many lovely little girls were sitting and standing, some doing needlework, some chatting and laughing. Among them was a little girl named Alice, who had many photos of men pasted behind her closet. Wasn't this a fresh and interesting piece of news? So everyone gathered around her and teased her. Over there, another female student was holding a letter from home, shouting, "My mother said she killed a pig, why doesn't she send me ham to eat!" This sentence elicited another burst of laughter. At this moment, they suddenly heard leather shoes outside. A detective standing by the door hurriedly gave her classmates a meaningful look. Everyone knew that the teacher was coming, and they immediately fell silent.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the kitchen. Groups of female cooks were talking animatedly. A maid ran in very hurriedly and said, "The students are clamoring that they are hungry, hurry up!" A cook put down the basin she was holding and turned around to say, "Hungry?" They are all the children of soldiers, and they will have to be the mothers of soldiers in the future; moreover, we Prussians are full of patience. Can't they even bear a hungry stomach?" Another said, "Half a pound of cream is to be distributed to fifty girls. It is very strange that so many girls have never complained. I will definitely give my share to them." (To be continued)</p>
