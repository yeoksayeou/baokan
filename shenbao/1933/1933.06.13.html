<h3>日本挑戰態度</h3>
<p>着眼在消滅抵貨</p>
<p>力避討論中日案</p>
<p>東京世界經濟會議開會之前、英國對日本經濟表示露骨挑戰態度、因此日本對經濟會議之旣定方針、亦變爲主戰的態度、内田外相對石井代表發如次訓令、日政府對於經濟會議之態度、與各國協力爲原則、然如有使日本存立危殆者、斷然排擊之、即如中國之排日貨運動、日本不求國際之助力、單獨處理、故在世界經濟會議日本代表對於中國排日問題、不提出任何要求、又參加會議之某國壓追日本經濟、日本亦對此採取積極政策、與之開始經濟爭　、（十一日日聨電）</p>
<p>東京現悉日政府未有新訓令致日本出席世界經濟會議代表團、因在代表團離東京時、均已接受詳細之訓示云、聞日代表團對於解救現時世界商業壓迫一點、將主張自由貿易及剷除國際間自由貿易之障礙、至於經濟抵制之問題、將由日本代表轉首席代表石井相機處理、現聞如其他各國贊成締結一普遍稅則之協定、則日本亦將加入、但日官方謂日本十年來未嘗加稅、故稅率較低云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦日代表團十一日上午五時開第一次代表團會議、協議應付經濟會議對策、石井全權以下松平深井兩代表及其他主要隨員均出席、最先决定石井代表於十四日會議席上發表之演說内容、關於經濟會議幹部會委員之選出方法交換意見之結果、如係由議長任命則日代表石井當然爲其委員、且或可得副議長之地位、亦未可知至於一般委員會、貨幣委員會、及經濟委員會等各分科委員會、日本俟其成立之後决定代表、據現在情形、日本擬不提議中日問題、然如見提出則决意斷然抗爭、（十一日日聨電）</p>
<h3>日貨對外傾銷</h3>
<p>使各國魂夢不安</p>
<p>柏林哥龍尼亞報爲文論倫敦會議、謂「倫敦會議欲安定貨幣、使之有健全之基礎、恐感遇一種障礙、即日本以通貨膨漲政策、在世界各市場與人競爭是也、」該報謂日本之競爭、使各國出口商人魂夢不安其言曰、「日本窮兵黷武忘其所以、欲以通貨膨漲政策作財政之護符、而於日後不可救藥之結果則未暇黷及、美國對於日本由侵略手段在中國所取得之地位、旣不欲承認則欲美國在政治上對日本讓步、斷乎不能、然則由經濟上設法、以避免日本方面之抵抗、其或可能乎、顧亦未可必也、蓋最惠國待遇之原則、自哇太華協定成立之後、巳飄搖不定矣」云云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>當前兩大難題</h3>
<p>貨幣與戰債</p>
<p>巴黎時報評論　界經濟會議、謂在該會開幕之前、吾人覺有兩種問題、大足影響會議工作之進展、其一爲貨幣問題、此事非恢復金本位、不能誠意解决、但截至目下止、美元與英鎊尙毫無穩定之跡象第貨幣問題、决非以人力强使黄金從新分配所能解决、如採取此種敷衍手段則世界各國貨幣必將普遍貶價、在世界經濟混亂之現狀下、試行此種手段、不免失之危險、世界各國凡不欲在精神及財政混亂之狀况中求生活者、對此敷衍之策莫不堅决反對除貨幣外、第二重要問題爲戰債之解决云（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>三國財下政會議</h3>
<p>對安定幣價意見趨接近</p>
<p>巴黎巴黎各報今日俱登載倫敦日昨舉行之英·美·法三國財政要人會議新聞、頗爲詳盡、並據報告、該項討論以幣制鞏固及其他幣制問題爲中心、惟小巴黎人報則稱、該會議之目的、爲討論某數項懸而未决一問題、欲於世界經濟會議開幕前、得一解决方案、俾得共同提出於世界經濟會議云、此三國現操有世界金額全部百分之七十、故事前意見之交換、實屬當務之急也、他報如晨報則稱、關乎幣制之安定、已由此次會議覓得一協定之接近、惟完全協定之本身、則尙未到「　的云、（十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>戰債償付問題</h3>
<p>白宮研究是否合法</p>
<p>美國會今明日休會</p>
<p>華盛頓羅斯福總統左右現正研究戰債一部份償付是否合法、及接受此種償付是否成爲明白承認其餘債欸可以不付之問題、聞英國業已由駐美大使林德賽向美政府非正式建議償付六月十五日到期之欠美戰債一部份、巴爾狄摩太陽報社論謂一部份之償付、勢將造成政治上糾紛、因此舉將以洛桑公約爲根據也、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓國會民主黨領袖今日與羅斯福總統會商、並向總統聲明今夜或明日國會定可休會云、總統對於六月期債欵之决議、如贊成一部份償付則當可得反對取銷戰債者之歡迎、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>車站人山人海</h3>
<p>法意等國代表最後趕到</p>
<p>倫敦民衆至車站瞻仰經濟會議各國代表之風采者、極爲擁擠、凡無任何職務、而純以好奇之心前往車站者、均被警察擱阻、站立後排、站台上往來者均爲行政機關人員、鐵路當局、因各國外交人員來倫敦者人數過多、特將下午七時由海口至倫敦之列車加倍掛車、（十一日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>倫敦各國代表今日抵此、絡繹不斷、最後一批爲法·意·捷克·羅馬尼亞·葡萄牙·及南斯拉夫六國之代表、夜間始到此六國駐英使署皆派員到維多利亞車站迎迓、法代表團中有法總理達拉第、捷克代表團中有外長皮尼士博士皮博士在國聨事件中聲譽頗著、（十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>某外交家</p>
<h3>對大會之觀感</h3>
<p>北平據某外交家談、此次世界經濟會議唯一目的、在解决世界經濟問題、惟因内情太複雜、其結果目前尙難斷定、但與過去之各種會議證之、預料此次會議之結果殊難抱樂觀、我國此次參加該會、並未抱有很大之希望、、不過視爲解决糾紛之一線署光而巳將來能否得到良好結果、全視列强各國有無誠意而定、據聞倘此次會議進行順利、除討論所規定六大綱目外、或可討論其他問題、總之、對此次大會望國人不要希望太高、即使有良好之决議案、亦未必能實行、過去國聨之决議案可爲明鑑、在此嚴重之局面下、推有自身努力、始能脫離武力之靨迫、（十二日中央社電）</p>

<h3>西北角上的馮玉祥</h3>
<p>國安</p>
<h3>從頭說起</h3>
<p>基督將軍自從民國十九年、在隴海綫上被迫後退、就鬱鬱不得志、的在西北半個天裏、讀書寫字的潛伏着、九一八事變、基督將軍就開始扯着喉嚨、也照樣的和别人一樣的喊『抵抗』的口號、喊的聲音雖然是娓娓動聽然而基督將軍仍然没有跑到前綫上去、但是這一回可變樣了、蹲在張家口土兒溝裏圖書館的基督將軍、實在有點忍耐不下去灤東砲火的響聲剛消沉、而基督將軍立在張家口土兒溝頂上、振臂一呼、居然實行抗日、於是緊接着西北角上的戰雲、就在報紙上一點點的顯着緊張、反正不住在西北角上的人們、誰能夠知道是息麽一回事、不過報紙是這樣的、『日僞軍佔沽源、逼近張家口方振武獨石口大戰逆軍······』這不是眞正抗日是什麽、</p>
<p>我在察哈爾省的省城『張家口』住了一個多月、又和基督將軍有一面之緣、同時基督將軍在張家口土兒溝圖書館裏、自動就同盟軍總司令職的那天、（五月二十六日）我還住在張家口的華元旅館、恭逢這樣抗日的大典禮、天公都似乎替基督將軍助威、在下午四點鐘的時候、還痛快淋漓的落了一塲大雨、我冒着雨讀完那同盟軍總司令的大佈告、二十七號就狼狽而逃似的離開西北角上的張家口、現在基督將軍、已經眞正？和日僞軍接觸、據最近報載、兩軍的主力戰還快要開始了、那麽關於基督將軍在張家口的一切行動、我那能不詳細的報告給讀者們呢、最後我須聲明的、就是這篇記載、完全是忠實的裏而並没有一點意氣用事的地方、何况過去我也是一名小丘八、對於基督將軍、也有相當的崇拜呵、</p>
<h3>㈠土兒溝裏的基督將軍</h3>
<p>土兒溝在張家口車站的南面、圖書館就在土兒溝裏、據說基督將軍没有住圖書館以前、老百姓還能進去看書、自從基督將軍搬進去、門禁就森嚴了、由市裏到圖書館去横穿過鐵路、半面向右轉、兜兩個四十五度角的彎子、並且你還得吃些沙土面、很辟靜的小巷子在靠進圖書館有三百米達遠時、你就能看見基督將軍的衛兵、在墻角上都是複哨、同樣的右手裏握着明亮亮的大刀、腰帶上繫着木柄的手炸彈、圖書館外面的土大門上、也是兩個衛兵、大刀之外還有盒子炮、一個個衛兵的臉上、都帶着黑而亮的光彩、在這裏我們承認基督將軍是一個訓練士兵的好榜樣、常常看到基督將軍的衛兵、在街上肩着黑烏烏的大煤塊、同時早晨和黄昏的空氣裏、永遠是流動着那雄壯而悲凉的軍歌調子、</p>
<p>據說基督將軍、自從搬入了書館、老是把着書本子讀、自己看不懂、還請了幾位先生不時的敎、基督將軍自信玩槍桿的本事、已經有相當的把握、於是從新開始研究政治、三民主義、不用說基督將軍讀的非常熟就是蘇聨的共產主義、以及什麽法西斯主義他都作過深切的研究、所以他始終是以抗日爲目的、雖然多倫失守、察東危急的時候、基督將軍没有什麽確切的表示但這一砲可放的對了、至少同盟軍總司令的頭街、可戴得上了、土兒溝的圖書館、一變而爲同盟軍總司令部、西北角上的張家口、這個時候、已成基督將軍的抗日大本營了、</p>
<p>在不久以前、基督將軍害過喉嚨痛、偏偏那個在時候、我坐着黄包車、到土兒溝裏的圖書館去拜訪他、經過了門崗的盤查、我拿出了一張卡片、請傳達處轉遞進入、那知道他們看見了我的卡片、都有點現出驚奇的樣子、旁邊有個粗粗大大的兵、自己這樣說着『啊！上海來的、這麽遠的路、一定是南方人呵、我假裝没有聽見、替我傳話那個着靑色中山裝的兵、他臨向後轉時很不在意的這樣問、我「先生你是什麽地方人呵、」「呵！······」我稍微停頓了一直才說、『我是河南人、』這樣一來、在我身旁的幾個灰色的傢伙、越發露着驚奇的樣子望着我、嘴裏並且嘘着、『呵·河南人』</p>
<p>我在圖書館門前的崗樓旁邊、立了有五分鐘的工夫、那着靑色中山裝的傳達、由第二道門出來了、我趕快迎上去、他於是很客氣的說、『先生實在對不住、馮先生這幾大害喉嚨痛的還没有好、實在辜負先生的盛意、如果先生有什麽事情、可以在書面上和馮先生討論、」我聽到最後、仍然是不能夠和馮先生見面、同時還呌在書面是討論、這到新奇的很、我呆了半天、用一種很誠懇的態度、向他說着、『對不住你、請你再向馮先生說一聲、我由上海來是很遠的路呵、並且馮先生現在的近况如何、國内的民衆、都很關心的、我們當新聞記者、的就彷彿代表那些急於先生要知道馮近况的民衆代表一様、所以無論如何、總要當面談幾句話方好、新聞記者拜訪一個要人、在書面上是行不通的呵、』這個小兵、聽我說了這一番辣椒與橄欖的話、於是一掉頭又進去了半天、這回還是没是成功、但是意思巳經有些活動了、『先生、馮先生遵醫生囑、實在不能會先生、請先生把地址留下、今日下午六七點鐘的時候、容或馮先生派一位代表和你談話、並且代表所說的話、馮先生都負責任的、』我聽完最後的回答、自己知道糾纒也無益、於是很客氣的和他們行了一個脫帽禮、他們都是睜圓了一對對的大眼睛、給我行那嚴肅整齊的舉手禮、我在風沙土面裏、又坐上了黄包車、心裏不住這樣的想着、『呵馮先生害喉嚨痛、說不定是因爲喊抗日的口號喊的太起勁了、』</p>
<p>我從土兒溝圖書館回來、就規規矩矩的在華元旅館裏、候着我們基督將軍的代表、時間剛到六點一刻、我所等候的那位代表已經由茶房引導進來了、這位代表、身體很粗壯的、頭上戴一頂美國水兵式的小白帽、態度非常豪爽、一進門他就操着灤東的口音說、『你是萬先生吧、』『吧</p>
<p>是的、』『貴姓』我接着問『姓張、』這時他巳坐在靠窗的一隻椅子上了、我拿給他一枝砲台香烟、擦着火柴他自己燃着、我打算向他交換名片、他很客氣的說、『對不住、先生我身邊没有帶名片、我寫給你吧、於是他在我的名片上、寫了三個字『張久榮』、緊接着他很嚴肅的說、『今天馮先生因爲喉嚨没有好、呌兄弟來和先生談幾句話、但是兄弟有一件事須聲明的、就是兄弟的名字、最好不要在報上發表、』我當時點點頭、（現在我好像失了信用似的、如張先生你看見這篇文字的話、我向你道十二萬分的歉意、）我們兩個人中間靜默了有兩分鐘的光景、我開始問他、『張先生、現在馮先生對於目前中日戰事、有什麽意見没有、同時馮先生抗日</p>
<p>的辦法、到底什麽時侯能實現、』他把眼球向上轉了兩轉、張開兩片厚厚的嘴唇皮、發着很嘹亮的聲音、好像在廣大羣衆面前演講似的、向我說着、『馮先生對於目前中日的戰爭、總覺得不能整個去對外、是一件最大的害處、灤東我軍的敗退、並不是戰鬥失敗、乃是整個戰略的失敗、指揮不能夠統一、所以敵人攻擊前進、就越發的迅速了、至於馮先生抗日主張、不能夠實現、在這一點我們不能不諒解馮先生的苦衷、他並不是和别人一樣的空喊抗日口號、但他没有機會去實現呵、』『那麽馮先生對於察省的前途抱着什麽樣的觀念、』他把頭輕微的擺了一下、嘴唇邊上還很快的溜過一個微笑、同時他的演講似的聲音、又有點低下去了、『察哈爾嗎馮先生是無論如何要保守的呵、馮先生老早就說過、他很願意呌日本人的砲火、把他打死、以完成他抗日志</p>
<p>願、先生你看着吧、馮先生在最近的將來一定受民衆的擁護呵、』受民衆擁護、這是多麽一句嚮亮的說話呵、我很靜默的聽着他那滔滔不斷的宏論、我們談了有一點鐘的工夫、最後我又向他說、『張先生、最好能想法呌我和馮先生談幾句話才好、』他沈思了一晌、『好的、你聽着電話吧、』就這様我們基督將軍的代表張久榮先生很、慷爽的互相握了一次手、就在電燈影裏告别了、（未完）</p>

<h3>昨日招待報界</h3>
<p>報告此次華北戰區救護經過</p>
<p>並與各界籌商今後救濟辦法</p>
<p>世界紅卍字會中華總會會長兼東北難民救濟會副董事長熊希齡、於昨日下午一時、假座福州路杏花酒樓招待各報社記者、報告華北戰區救護情形、及善後辦法、到者各報社記者四十餘人、由熊氏親自招待、茲將報告各情分誌於下、</p>
<h3>救濟工作此次榆關熱河事變</h3>
<p>、相繼發生敝會即組救濟隊十四隊、開赴朝陽·凌源·開魯·秦皇島等處、實施救濟傷兵難民、旋承德失守、戰事擴大、原有救濟隊、不敷應用、敝會即召集全華紅卍字會、開一救濟大會、决定擴大救濟、又加組特别救濟隊十餘隊、計前後共有二十七隊之多、由鄙人與許君蘭洲親自率領、躬赴喜峯口冷口灤縣及長城一帶、加緊工作、一面救護傷兵、一面救濟難民、因之辦理後方臨時醫院治療傷兵之外、並在平津察設立難民收容所十餘處、收容難民、歷時三月共用去四十餘萬元之譜、此欵皆係敝會總分各會共同分担、</p>
<h3>善後辦法鄙人離後、平津形</h3>
<p>勢、日趨緊張、各地難民、紛紛逃往平津一帶者不下數十萬、人敝會又增設臨時收容所十餘處、前後收容難民至五萬人以上、此項難民、大都家產蕩盡、田廬邱墟、其現時之維持與將來之遣置、若無澈底善後辦法、即令回鄕之後、一無所有、仍將無法生存、再前當戰事緊迫之時、傷亡將士不少、生者大都殘廢、死者尙待撫　、故設立殘廢院與撫卹陣亡遺族、亦爲刻不容緩之事、至此次戰事、旣非正式宣戰、故國際戰時公法、毫無効力、沿長城數千里之作戰區域、死屍數萬、均在火線之内、未得盡量掩埋、而以地理論、古北口之潮河、喜峯口之灤河、興隆縣之薊運河、石門寨之石河、其上游皆在長城以外、熱河境内、北方雨期、爲五月之末、若不趁此停戰期内、從事掩埋、（即有已掩埋者、除喜峯口宋部陣亡將士、由敝會爲之立一公墓較爲妥善外、其餘則因戰事劇烈、時間怱促、草草掩埋、故必須掘深另埋、以重人道、而資衛生、</p>
<h3>共起施救萬一大雨時行、</h3>
<p>没入河、則平津各都市之中外人民飲料、皆有傳染致疾之可憂、但以數千里戰區、欲認眞此項工作、非有千餘伕役、不能迅速　事、故戰區之防疫工作、亦須趕即辦理、敝會因辦理前後方救護諸端業已勉盡棉薄、且以前派出之救濟隊、均仍在各地辦理難民收容治療各事未敢稍懈、而以上所述之種種問題、至爲重大、决非一會之力所能完成、故特兼程來滬、與滬上各界仁人君子、商籌今後合作救濟辦法、幸蒙各界鑒納、允予合作、大約將設一華北戰區善、後救濟委員會辦理其事、此後救濟事務、千頭萬緒、尙待共同努力、新聞界諸君子均爲社會領導人物、對於社會公益、以及各項救濟、向極熱心贊助、至望諸君子喚醒各方人士、共起施救、並盼隨時加以指導、俾得完成華北戰區之善後當代災民九頓首以請、</p>
<h3>磋商結果記者旋以此次來滬</h3>
<p>結果如何、據熊氏見告九一八之役、張學良以不抵抗主義、失去東北三省版圖、至四百萬方里以上、風聲遠播、萬邦驚眙、鄙人對於各國人士之來詢問者、輒搖首長歎、無可告語、迨一二八之役、十九路軍奮勇抗日、相持至一月之久、雖以種種關係、訂立停戰協定、然國際聲譽、隨之增高、即鄙人此時、亦爲忻幸不置、此次榆關熱河事變、我軍旅繼續抵抗、頗爲奮勇、而宋哲元一師又爲之最、生回者祇二千餘人、故總計因此次戰事受傷者、計六萬餘人、殘廢者計一萬餘人而後方民衆捐助米麥柴草等項、計六千餘萬之多、但此種傷兵及難民、均宜設法位置、俾刦後子黎、不致流離失所、故鄙人來滬與仁濟堂及各方磋商之下、得有端倪、皆慈善家慷慨輸將當仁不讓而諸君之言論上之宣揚、尤屬不少、故今日僅備醴酒、藉答盛意、願一般民衆精誠團結、上下一心、則勾踐沼吳、、前車可鑒、鄙人願與諸君子共勉之、</p>

<h3>電告行將來滬</h3>

<h3>戴戟昨晨返滬</h3>
<p>至龍華司令部辦公</p>
<p>否認代表中央赴閩</p>
<p>德來第二機今晨到滬</p>
<h3>昨由蘭州飛京</h3>
<p>中央社云、歐亞航空公司新機兩架、於上月末由德經歐俄來華、試飛歐亞航線一架業於日前抵滬、另一架因專送新疆宣慰使入新、故又折回迪化、已於十日到達、當又東返來滬、以完成一萬公里之歐亞航綫、茲悉該機已於昨晨由蘭州起飛、當晚七時抵京、暫留一晚、定今晨來滬、大約十時可到、又據該公司經理李景樅語記者、歐亞聨運事德俄雙方、均已商妥、故新疆變亂、如能平靖、則七月初即可飛塔城與俄德線聨絡又談西北航線、明日（即今日）爲開航期、故决用新由德京飛來之Ｍ三十四號機、蓋其容量較大、可多載旅客及郵件、惟該機經一萬公里之長途飛行後、必須檢視機件、以免機件發生障碍、檢查工作、現在進行中、明日（即今日））始可完畢、故航期决展緩一日、於後晨（即明晨）起程、</p>
<p>淞滬警備司令戴戟、九日由福州乘輪返滬後、翌日即赴蘇、探視其夫人之病、昨晨八時、由蘇乘夜車返滬、九時、至龍華警備司令部辦公、銷假視事、本報記者、昨晨特往司令部訪問、由司令部秘書處主任徐義衡代見、據稱戴司令今次赴閩、全係辦理六十一師交代、及與陳銘樞等晤聚、外傳代表中央、解釋誤會諸說均係揣測、並非事實、戴司令對國呈毫無主張、祇知奉命駐滬、當勉力盡其本分内之責任云、</p>
<p>海軍自造飛機</p>
<h3>今日環市飛航</h3>
<p>長途飛航將於本星期五六出發</p>
<p>國聞社云、海軍飛機製造處處長曾詒經氏、近擬架自造之江鳳號飛機、作沿長江水上長途飛行、昨日記者復晤曾氏於高昌廟、據談、本處有工人百餘、預定每年可造機六架、惟近因經濟關係、祇可出兩架、現海部每月撥經費約六千餘元、前中政會通過增撥之費、係最近提出購料費三十萬耳、曩時楊部長時代、亦曾提出免購機金錢之外溢、曾提㈠擴充海軍飛機製造處、積極自造、㈡中央向外購機時、</p>
<h3>江鳳飛機前之曾詒經氏及蒲利氏</h3>
<p>（李尊庸攝）</p>
<p>必需提出一部交製造處自造、但此案迄未實行、本人爲提倡飛機自造之目的、最近故有作長途飛航之舉、現已决定明日（即今日）先作環市（上海）飛行、其長途航預定本星期五六、擇天氣良好即出發、降落地點爲南通·鎭江·南京·蕪湖·安慶·九江·漢口·岳州·長沙·沙市·迨至宜昌折回上海·休息數日然後再飛寗波·温州·厦門·福州·至閩後所乘之江鳳機即留馬尾航空處、作爲敎練之用、本人即搭船返滬即告完畢、現本處所造飛機一架、至年底方能完工、將來即配置於寗海艦上、至於長途飛行之江鳳號、造於民國二十年、發動機爲美國若持式、馬力一六五四、满載重量一一一六公斤、發火速力一九零公里巡航速力一五七、降落速力九一公里、海面升空一三六公尺、極頂高度三八一零公尺、種類水上爲偵察敎練機云云、</p>
<p>國聞社云、曾詒經君爲我國自造飛機專家、以低微之經費、及簡陋之工廠、本其素養之學識、及偉大之毅力、終造成江鳳江鶴等軍用機多架、明日將作七省之試航、將來航空救國、可不依賴他、人厥功甚偉、曾君有「我國自造飛機成功之經過」一文、載遠東月報創刋號、如有欲一讀我國第一次自造飛機之經過者、可附郵一角、函蕯坡賽路二二一號該報社索閱可也、</p>
<h3>東北歸客痛語</h3>
<p>日欲以亡韓故智亡我東北民族大通社記者昨晤由東北潛逃來滬之長春小學敎員張志塵君、承告以僞組織最近現狀、及日方力圖統治東北之各項阾謀甚詳、茲特分誌如下、</p>
<h3>完成敦圖鐵路</h3>
<p>敦圖鐵路（由敦化至圖們江）卽以前吉會鐵路之一段、自經日方於去年五月中旬、委托南满鐵道會社積極建築以來、已於本年四月二十日全部宣告竣工、並已開始通車營業、全線共長一百九十二基羅米突、自敦化起、歷經大橋·大石頭·哈爾巴嶺·南溝·亮兵台·明月溝·茶條溝·榆樹川·老頭溝·銅佛寺·朝陽川·延吉·磨盤山·葦子溝·南陽等十五站而達圖們江、嗣後朝鮮日軍、卽可藉此路而直達北满、因在此路未完成之前、朝鮮日軍之欲開赴北满、者均須　由大連轉達、今則可直由敦圖敦吉以達北满、較之過去、敏捷良多、且敦圖鐵路沿綫各縣、其出產之富饒、尤爲東北各地冠、輸出商品、年在四·二一○·二九七·五一一·四○七石以上、面積達四萬五千四百四十方里、人口則爲七十萬零七千三百七十餘名、今則悉已淪入日人之手、收復無期言之實堪痛心、</p>
<h3>計劃中之兩路</h3>
<p>自敦圖鐵路建築完竣後、日方又復計劃興築拉哈（由拉法至哈爾濱）延海（由延吉至海林）兩鐵路、以期統治我整個東北及開發各地富源現此項計劃、業已開始準備、並經派有大批工程師、分赴兩綫沿途視察測量、大約本年八九月間、卽可興工建築、</p>
<h3>稅收較前驟减</h3>
<p>自僞組織在日方卵翼下宣告成立後、一切行政大權、悉操日人之手、傀儡溥儀、並無權過問日方爲安插東北失業日僑起見、卽儘量增設機關、甚至一部之組織多至二十餘課、職員達六百餘人、故支出激增、而日貨之輸入僞組織境内者、又復不納關稅、以致稅收驟减、較諸九一八以前、短收至十分之六、日方當局爲平均預算起見、乃對於内地經營之華人、徴收種種苛稅、又復力行鴉片公賣、以增益其收入、現僞組織境内各地、烟館到處林立、烟槍則每支日收捐稅满幣一元、而美其名曰娱樂捐、其他如賭窟妓院、更屬不可勝數、總之東北同胞、均已成爲日人刀上之魚肉矣、</p>
<h3>義軍乘機崛起</h3>
<p>但有一事足以稍慰余心者、卽各地義軍、因靑紗帳已起而日見活躍是也、現日方之關東軍部、對於此項義軍、已擬定包抄撲減計劃、希冀早除心腹大患、無如義軍出没無常、行踪莫定、且僞軍中尙不乏正在伺機反正之愛國志士、故日方上此項詭計、均爲義軍所探悉、而得以從容應付、現義軍所採用之戰略、爲游擊式、抱定「你來我去、」「避重就輕」、「乘虚　　」十二字秘訣、以致日軍雖欲大施包圍而不可得、加以土匪遍地、搶掠　聞更足使日方手忙脚亂、而窮於應付、</p>
<h3>實施文字滅種</h3>
<p>至於僞組織境内之各學校、其敎職員亦悉爲日人、所訂課程、以日文爲必修課每日佔在小時、英美文各佔一小時、其餘一小時則半小時爲體操、半小時爲華文、日人之欲師亡韓故智、而以文字滅我　族之野心、於此可見一斑、且同在一校之學生、華童如在途遇見日童時、必須立正敬禮、否則必遭辱駡、逆料十五年後、數百萬東北民衆、必悉成爲日人之牛馬矣、</p>
<h3>華農束手待斃</h3>
<p>末後張君又謂、東北各地數百萬華、農現均在束手待斃、蓋日方自以武力佔據東北後、爲實行其移民政策起見、卽陸續將其國内各地失業民衆、運赴朝鮮屯墾、而將朝鮮農民、則悉數赤手移墾東北、不料此輩朝鮮農民、早已忘却自身亡國之痛、反認賊作父、一味依勢横行强佔華農住宅、鶕巢鳩佔、刦奪耕田農具、以爲已有、華農設有反抗、卽遭慘殺、甚全威迫華農、爲其奴隷、以供驅策至於姦淫擄掠、猶其餘　、鳴呼、東北農民何辜、而爲亡國奴之隷耶、深望我政府當局及全國民衆一致奮起、以拯救此上天無門、入地無路之東北同胞、爲國家保留一分元氣云云、</p>
<p>長江漲水</p>
<h3>影響上游商貨</h3>
<p>沙宜客帮已電滬减運</p>
<p>前年漢口大水、至四十二尺六寸、即已浸入市内、成爲一片汪洋、釀成罕有慘災、上年經國府水災救濟委員會利用美麥、以工代賑、建造江堤、爲防止水災之根本大計、詎今歲江水又漲、至昨日止、漢口水量、據電告已到三十九尺四寸、比較前年最高水位、祇差二尺七八寸矣、沿江較低之處、水與岸平、苟再增漲、難免不從溝渠浸入市内而新造堤岸之閘口、在必要時、亦將堵閉、以防危險、九江至漢口一帶上下水長江船、已禁行快車、沿江危險地方、巡江司增置紅色警燈、以免往來商船之肇禍、長江上游之宜昌、較昨日電告、水勢亦繼張增高、超過三十二尺以上、該處並無堤防、設再激增、在在有浸入市内之危險、邇日滬上疋紗、正當大批裝往宜昌沙市兩地、刻因漲水影響、沙宜客帮、已發電至滬、命將該項疋紗、切勿全數運去、先載一小部份、以免大水侵襲云、</p>
<p>首批</p>
<h3>阿根延麥進口</h3>
<p>先來三船二萬五千噸</p>
<p>爲南美貿易上之創舉</p>
<p>各國農產過剩、正苦缺乏銷路、而我國粉廠、貪其價廉、紛紛訂購初購、美麥、繼辦澳麥、今更向南美定購、業有一批運到、查南美運麥來華、此尙爲第一次亟將詳情查報如下、</p>
<h3>購入數量</h3>

<h3>蘇聨農業五年計劃提要</h3>
<p>高志譯全書一九六頁紙面六開本實價洋五角</p>
<p>蘇聨的五年建設計劃，其内容雖是一種普遍的社會建設，但尤其注重於農業方面，卽國勞農塲及共營農塲之建立，與農業工業化。因此，對於蘇聨的農業五年計劃，我們就有特别提出研究之必要。本書係高志翔女士根據蘇聨農業人民委員雅柯李夫YAYakovlev關於農業建設計劃的報告及演講的英譯本所轉譯。全書分五章叙述。第一章先述美國的大規模農業組織。爲什麽要先說美國的農業呢？據雅柯李夫說：「蘇聨的農業的進步和現狀的充分理解，不能僅僅從蘇聨的研究中所能得到的。爲了要避免自己的評價　關於過去的結果及將來的目標的錯誤起見，所以開始對於蘇聨及其他資本主義各國，尤其是美國的新的技術方法和大規模的發展實有比較的必要。这樣比較就能很明白地顯示出蘇聨農業的發展上的種種特徴，而且在我們工作上的優點和弱點，亦容易分析出來。」可見本章意義之重要，眞的，從這裏比較的叙述，我們可以更加明白看出同一事件在兩個不同的經濟體系下所得到的結果是如何完全不同。第二章述蘇聨的大規模農業組織。說明蘇聨大規模農業的迅速發展，共營農塲和國營農塲的迅速增加，富農日漸消滅，貧農日漸减少，農業充分機械化，生產手段日益社會化；國營農塲和共營農塲在蘇聨已經獲得了　實上的勝利，這不僅是空說，而是有具體的事實爲之證明。第三章述蘇聨農業發展的新任務，這新任務是對第一次五年年計劃而言，因爲在第一次五年計劃中關於共營化的程序，於一九三○年春已經完成，並且超過，所以對於農業發展計劃，必須根本改訂，重新决定其任務。此新任務爲何？第一，工業用農產物的鞏固化問題；第二，牧畜業等的再建及肉類供給問題的解决。，第三，榖物生產問題之終局的解决。本章卽對於此項新任務，分畜牧，飼料，榖物消費地帶，小麥生產地帶，棉花和亞麻五項叙述。他們是在把數十萬大規模農塲的優秀前鋒隊與組織者的共營農場員所得的經騐做基礎，在黨的一般方針的傾導下，勇往邁進，「在未來的數年間，他們不但能夠完全解决低生產力的小規模農場所發生的食料供給困難問題，而且相信在極短的歷史的期間内，一定能夠用資本主義社會裏所從未知道遇的進展速度，來满足蘇聨勞動者大衆的要求。」第四章述蘇聨對於鞏固和發展共營農塲所必須的組織方法。在蘇聨富農是反對共營農塲的，中農是動搖不定，要怎樣使一般農民參加共營農塲，並消滅其反動勢力，這是蘇聨所嚴密計劃着的。他們怎樣計劃着，在本章有詳細叙述。他們堅决地自信：無論如何困難横在他們面前，以蘇聨現有基礎，最後必能澈底達到共營化。雅柯李夫這樣說：「我們在背後有這些經騐，我們立在黨的一般方針的基礎上，我們可以大膽的陳述，要校正一切，無論何時，無論何人犯的錯誤。我們將不許任何人阻礙我們的共營化達到最後的目的，這個最後的目的，就是社會主義社會的創造！」第五章結論，是雅柯李夫人在大會代表者討論其報告後的一個綜括的說明，並答復幾個質問。最後他這樣說：「要之，我們結論是在共營化運動和國營農塲的基礎上。我們可以毫無疑義的比以前更敏捷地追上别國。」的確，看了蘇聨農業五年計劃已往的成果，誰都不會說他這句話是誇張。末附附錄五篇，一，第一次五年計劃中農業共營化的實續；二，蘇聨農業之機械化；三，關於農　村工作；四，美國農民的悲哀；五，共營農塲運動與農業的改善。皆係不可多得的重要參考資料，足與本　互相發明。目下各國農村，莫不閙着極度恐慌，尤其是我國農村，在外國資木主義壓迫之下，今日巳將完全破產。其區别之點究竟在那裏？眞値得我們研究。面本書就很能對於我們這種研究，給以一個重要的指示。凡留心蘇聨農業及我國農村問題者，此書實不可不讀。首附插圖八幅</p>
<h3>申報叢書</h3>
<h3>歐美的航空提要</h3>
<p>徐淵若編著全書七六頁，紙面六開本書價洋二角五分</p>
<p>現代戰爭，因航空事業之發達，空軍已經佔到一個很重要的地位。本書中引英國史丕德語，謂將來戰爭的勝負，不决於塹壕或海上，而决於空戰。空軍對於將來之戰爭上，其重要可見一斑，世界眞正和平，一日未能實現，人類之大屠殺，必不能免。空軍對於將來戰爭的偉力，自然値得人們注意。我國現有的海陸軍力量，是貧弱到那麽可憐，空軍自更不必說。然而時代之狂風暴雨，則已即將到來，我們對於未來世界大戰，豈能無所準備？一年來日本空軍對我國各地龔擊，這滋味我們也該嘗够了，他所給予我們的敎訓星些什麽？本書之作，其目的卽在介紹各國空軍槪况，促起國人對於空軍之注意。全書分二章。第一章述歐美列强航空界的現狀，復分軍事航空與民間航空兩部分。就美·法·英·意·蘇等國分别叙述。從這裏我們可以看到歐美各國在大戰後因受大戰之敎訓，如何急劇的擴充其空軍，在十年之間獲得了驚人的成績。不但在軍事航空有特殊發展，即民間航空，亦以政府之獎勵與私人之努力而有一日千里的進步。此種民間航空事業的發達，實含有重要意義，卽在戰時，此類民間航空飛機，可立時悉行改作軍事之用。所以嚴格說起來，這種民間航空，也可說是軍事航空之一部份，而且有幾國對於民間航空，此較軍事航空更爲重視，其意義可想而知。第二章述歐美列强之空防。分㈠歐戰中列强之空中襲擊及損失，㈡戰前及戰時之歐洲防空，㈢歐美列强空防設施之現狀，㈣列强的民間空防設施四節述之。從這裏我們可以知道，一國空防設備，尤其在戰時是怎樣特别重要。假若「一個國家，飽受敵機之空中襲擊的時候，而自身不能有飛機來抗戰，則該國家足以在數小時之内立刻變爲廢邱。」此固不必證之於書本，一二八日本飛機在閘北的轟炸，就是最好的實證。本章卽分述歐美列强在大戰時因空防設備不週所受到敵機威脅的事實及現在對於空防設備的情形。全書於歐美列强航空事業之現狀，叙述極爲扼要，而於航空事業之重要，尤大聲疾呼再三致意。實際上，在今日之世界，「無空軍卽無國防，」則國人讀是　而後，感望固當如何？</p>

<h3>體育協進會場地回間題</h3>
<p>沈嗣良之談話</p>
<p>該會尙未接得正式通知書</p>
<p>即使收回協會並不生問題</p>
<p>爲上海着想應覓一運動塲</p>
<p>關於本埠勞神父路中華全國體育協進會塲地將爲地主洛氏基金團收回、捐贈國立醫學院一事、深爲體育界注意、記者特於昨日走訪全國體育協進會名譽主幹沈嗣良、詢以塲地之眞相及今後之計劃、茲詳細探錄如下、</p>
<h3>尙未有通知書</h3>
<p>洛氏基金團欲收回塲</p>
<p>地並捐贈國立醫學院</p>
<p>事、已在報端見之矣、但協進會尙未接到正式通知書、至於建築醫院、茲事體大、非短時間可以成功、故塲地卽使收回、仍可以暫時借用、今年冬令之足球季、大致可無問題、</p>
<h3>場地收回歷史</h3>
<p>足球塲田徑塲田籃球房</p>
<p>及綱球塲最初由遠東</p>
<p>運動會中國委辦兼總幹事葛雷氏（卽全國靑年協會體育幹事）、將第五屆遠東運動會之餘欵經營、棒球塲則由格洛潑及别爾斯二人以私欵經營、虧出達萬餘元、當體育協進會收回時、奉得程貽澤氏之資助、故棒球塲之收回、程氏之功甚大、足球塲後面空地多畝、早經洛氏基金團售與法工部局、今已建築開辦華童公學矣、</p>

<h3>林梁新伉儷昨抵滬</h3>
<p>下榻滄洲飯店昨晚親友歡宴</p>
<p>定二十六日赴四川蜜月旅行</p>
<p>綱球國手林　華君與綱球花梁佩瑜女士、　　本月十日上星期六在天津行結婚禮、兒女英雄珠聨璧合、亦我國體育史上之佳話、林·梁·新伉儷於昨日下午自津抵滬親友往迎者甚盛、新夫婦下榻滄洲飯店、擬將於月之二十六日赴程往四川作蜜月旅行、</p>
<p>從戀愛到結婚梁女士於十九年春偕其妹佩瑤女士代表天津在杭出席全運會、奪得錦標芳名遂震海内、自杭返滬、因病在滬小住、卽識林君、從此球塲姻緣、日久更濃、遂訂婚焉迄今已二年矣但從未宣布、迫三星期之前才在津正式宣布訂婚、復以時局關係、乃提前結婚、　　津英領爲證婚星期六上午十一時、新人在天津英國領事館行結婚禮、由英國駐津領事證婚、中外佳賓、盛極一時、梁女士父梁炎卿爲旅津粤僑鉅商、兄爲怡和洋行買辦、、交游甚廣也</p>
<p>赴四川度蜜月结婚之後、當晚卽搭快車南下、昨日下午五時、抵上海北站、卽往滄洲飯店休息、昨晚滬上親友、設宴祝賀、新伉儷於月之二十六日往四川作蜜月、新婚探蜀險、其樂融、惟本季球塲、恐不能見林君身手矣、（照王開　）</p>
<h3>協會力量不夠</h3>
<p>協進會對於該場、已　　頗費競爭之力量矣、</p>
<p>當初幾次三番請求洛氏基金團捐讓、終究未得效果、良以欲得該地者頗衆、且屬於醫界者頗多而洛氏基金團復着重於醫界之事業故醫界之請求、效力較大、故國立醫學院之所以能成功也、又有一層、近年來法工部局之地稅激增當初全部地皮每月祇納二百兩、今竟須二千兩增至十倍之多是以該地卽不收回、協進會實尙無力量付地稅矣、</p>
<h3>協會不成問題</h3>
<p>地皮收回以後、在協進會方面、可謂毫無　　問題、協進會乃全國業餘體育行政機關、祇須設一辦事處、固無須運動場之設立、但爲全上海體育界着想、不得不設法一運動塲地、協進會董事會及熱心體育者、曾數度接洽過矣、</p>
<h3>找覓場地之難</h3>
<p>塲地收回後、上海體　　育界當受重大影響、　　故不得不找一適當地點、開闢一運動場、楊樹浦徐家匯及江灣市中心處、均曾前往視察、地皮足够應用、但或以地皮昻貴、或以交通不便、均不相宜、今在滬西方面找覓、（並非大西路）雖地點稍覺偏僻、交通尙覺便利、在不满意中、已比較的相宜、故場地之目的、大致在滬西方百着眼又前申　跑狗場、最爲相宜、協進會頗屬意於此、惜地價太貴、不能成爲專實、</p>
<h3>協會生財問題</h3>
<p>至於協進會之生財、如何擺佈、此點亦無問題現在場上之設備、已不値錢、寫字間及籃球房均不能拆動、因當初訂立合同時、載明凡場上之固定建築物、在場地收回時、不得拆動、故歷年來協進會對於建築方面、始終不敢實行、萬一場地收回、枉費金錢耳、</p>
<h3>將來體育局面</h3>
<p>因此番協進會地皮有　　收回之議、上海熱心體育者、頗思另組織一上海業餘運動協進、統轄上海競技運動事業、此　協進會極望實現、蓋如此、協進會可毋須兼、顧上海之體育事業、可以全力注意於全國體育事業、及對外國際體育之推進矣、</p>
<p>斜土路一帶可覓運動場</p>
<h3>一個熱心體育者之意見</h3>
<p>沈君對於找覓塲地問題發表意見、已如上述茲有熱心體育者云、棒球塲能至今日之繁盛者因接近西門、學校林立、居民衆多、交通又便、故今尋塲地須在附近人口衆多之處、如斜土路帶、空地甚多、交通亦便、距離勞神父路不遠、甚爲相宜云、</p>

<h3>林鵬俠與史天孫</h3>
<p>— 瞻康</p>
<p>中國第一女飛行家林鵬俠女士隻身從陜甘靑寗綏察各省而來，大談其西北歸來的感想；一時學界中人，備極推崇，稱爲中國奇女子。吾讀報讀到這裏，對於中國第一女飛行家八個字，又是欣幸，又是悲惋；欣幸的女界裏面，居然有抱着大無畏精神的林女士，替女飛行家開這新紀元。悲惋的在這世界空軍連年激增的當兒，中國早說有女飛行家了，爲什麽直到今日才有這一位中國第一女飛行家林鵬俠女士呢？</p>
<p>在那十六年前歐戰未停時候的憧憬，美國飛行家史天孫女士曾到上海江灣試演飛機，得到滬上人士盛大的歡迎。假使在這時候，吾國的女界一齊努力起來，究竟有十六年的悠久時間，還待林女士做那破天荒的人物麽？女飛行家早已接踵而起了。我在十六年前曾戲擬一篇「代女界歡迎女飛行家史天孫啟，」當時幽默文章是注重駢　的，原書如左：</p>
<p>女士干雲志壯，逐電心長；非奔月之姮娥，似散花之天女。超以象外，不勝西方彼美之思，飛人雲端，竟作天際眞人之想。屏風上立，熏籠上行，不足喻其敏捷；靈鵲爲橋，靑島爲使，固已遜其神通。空空自天下，司馬公之取　，徒託空言；冷冷御風行，列禦寇之寓言，竟成實事。「中略」某等託體綠閨，馳心碧漢；縱有靈犀一點之心，恨無彩鳳雙飛之翼；旣不甘乎雌伏，定有誒乎雄飛。搏扶搖者三千里，高高在上之飛行家，可謂　乎遠矣；叩　　者八九重，碌碌無能之諸姊妹，不知何以勉之？</p>
<p>結尾的一聨是在激勵一般女界，敎伊們聞風興起的足與史天孫比美，只有林鵬俠一人；吾所虚撰的歡迎文，當然可以移贈林女士了。但，經了這悠久時間，才有移贈中國第一女飛行家的可能性，這是我當年落筆時候所夢想不到的。</p>
<h3>虎列拉上市</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>枇杷黄過之後，靑梅也跟着黄熟。天氣一天熱似一天，於是「虎列拉」上市了。「虎列拉」是不圖上進的。越是高等的家庭裏，「虎列拉」是望望然去之，越是「平民」，每况愈下而至「貧民」，「虎列拉」越同他們親暱。</p>
<p>蒼蠅大哥是「虎列拉」的「義務旅行社」，借着「義務旅行社」的力，漫遊於「頂怪怪十鈿一杯」的「杜製嗬囒水」，「密糖甜呀，十鈿一片」的西瓜，「白糖倫敎糕」，「陰凉地栗糕」之間。冷麵攤，酸梅湯，以及一切酸敗臭腐的「佳餚美味」，凡是蒼蠅大哥的「衣食父母」，都是「虎列拉」的「納凉勝地」。平民們及貧民們，野心勃勃，把虎列拉的「納凉勝地」，一口呑下肚去，這分明是「挦虎鬚」，「犯虎威」，「太歲頭上動土」，「虎列拉」不肯干休，便會像孫悟空那麽在你肚裏抄得五臟殿翻身，一把領口，拉拉扯扯地到閻羅王案前去打官司。</p>
<p>當然的，怕「虎列拉」囉擾，最好的方法，惟有遠避他的「納凉勝地」，而一方面，先去注射「防疫針」，實行「安内」。若是一個不留意，已被虎列拉攻進了「腹地」，那便應當趕快後退到時疫醫院去，「長期抵抗」，切不可硬挺，而做「虎列拉」的俘虜。有些人愛請剃頭師父去挑痧，那猶如用後膛槍去抵抗機關砲，準給「虎列拉」笑得打哈哈。</p>
<p>「虎列拉」上市了，大家得火燭小心，下戒嚴令。注射「防疫針」，實行「安内」，以防「内部的反動」，同時對於「外貨進口」，先得愼重地考慮而檢查一下，毫無嫌疑纔予通過。若是蒼蠅大哥不速而至，立下逐客令，或竟予以「斷然處置」，這是「取締虎列拉多民」的根本辦法。請市民們「精神團結」，「打倒虎列拉！」</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第九回謔語豈無由東床暗引</p>
<p>突來良有以西席閑籌</p>
<p>黄曼英在楊家借住的這一宵，給與了江氏母女，的衝動。江氏對於黄女士，固然站在贊成的一方面。就是桂枝自己也就想着，軍人不見得就是我們心裏想着那樣不好的。你看黄小姐要嫁的田連長，不也就是一個學生出身的人嗎？趟連長雖是没有田連長那樣活潑年輕，可是人很忠厚，也很有可取。由趙連長再反映甘積之一下，人也斯文，相貌也很俊秀，可是你聽聽他說的話，就前後不相符，只想做官發財，别的事一槪可以丢下，這樣看起來，還是趙連長好。他心裏有了這樣一個轉變，所以到了黄女士要問他的話時，他也只好氏首無言的了。吃過了晚飯，江氏悄悄的在街上賃了兩條三新棉被回來，在坑的另一頭，將這兩條被鋪好，却將原來自己的舗蓋，展開在對方，中間隔了一個很大的空當。江氏向曼英笑道：外面賃的棉被，我們不敢說是乾凈的，讓我們娘兒倆來睡。我們自己的舗蓋，是洗了過年的，您放心睡。說着用手向坑上指着。曼英呵喲了一聲道：你這樣客氣，倒呌我不好意思了。還請您把舗蓋　在一處罷，我也好和你們大姑娘躺着談談心。江氏笑道：不罷。你在城裏睡慣了鐵床的人，到我們這兒來睡土坑，這就受了委屈了，難道還要你委屈上又受委屈嗎？曼英見他還在客氣着，自己就走上前去，把舗蓋連着一處，用手拍了幾拍棉被，笑道：這就很好，我們一路同睡罷。說着，就伸手來扯桂枝的衣袖。桂枝笑道：在我們這裏，您是怪不舒服的，我們還要擠你啦。曼英笑道：您娘兒倆這樣說着，我倒成了大小姐了，大姑娘躺下罷，我們還可以　個天兒啦。江氏母女也覺得他爲人很洒脫，不能太違拗了他的意思。於是桂枝和曼英並連在坑上横躺着，江氏睡在桂枝的外邊。桂枝因爲曼英由城裏來的人，恐怕他不憤摸黑，並没有息燈。兩個人掙了眼睡在一頭，當然不能不說話。（九八）</p>
<h3>從黄金說到戀愛</h3>
<p>— 定明</p>
<p>黄金的硬度雖然比不上銀，比錫爲高，然而畢竟是金屬中最貴重的東西；由這舉世笑哈哈歡迎的東西中，</p>
<p>我看出戀愛的一切來！</p>
<p>黄金最主要的是自然金，次之爲含金黄鐵礦，至於成締化金而產出的，那有限的很；這，彷彿人們的婚姻前身，戀愛—自然的戀愛是最主要的，含戀愛的成分次之，至於成隔膜的反目的而產生戀愛，那也有限的很—</p>
<p>金子是黄色細碎物的能變爲紫色，紅色，暗褐色或黑色。條痕黄。富有延性</p>
<p>及展性。所以它那用途除鑄貨蹩，打金箔，拉引爲細綫，造飾物外，又可用製照相術上的藥與製玻璃陶磁業上應用的顏料。這，正如無形的戀愛的色，開頭一點點，慢慢兒淡靑色，淡黄色，淡紅色，而變成玫瑰色或變爲純一的白色。染的色素廣，富有伸性及編性，所以能給對手方的性情，舉動，學力，本能，各方面，染的花花綠綠，活活脫脫，寛寛深深。至於過渡到白熱度已極的結婚期。</p>
<p>金子的產地，世界以美國及澳洲爲主：在中國首推巳喪失的熱河，如：三叉口，灤平，八道河，朝陽等：遼寗，如：海龍香爐營子等：吉林，如：延吉鵓鴿磖子等：黑龍江，如：吉拉林阿拉雅漠河，庫瑪兒，梧桐河等處。又砂金則在黑龍江及其支流之沿岸：吉林則分佈於松花江，牡丹江，烏蘇里河，綏芬江各流域：遼寗則分佈於遼河，大洋河，靉河等流域。至於目下土地完整的河北，山東，湖南，湖北，安徽，福建，四川，西康，西藏，（？）蒙古，新疆，貴州，雲南等省，都是產金的地方。人們黄金般懋愛的開端，或發生於一　一笑？一問一答？一針一線？一菜一飯？一走一跑？一羞一忿？一哀一啼？一哼一喂？一聽一讀？一伸一觸？·········？</p>
<p>或開始於　衣拈帶？整帽理髮？馳馬擊劍？足球游泳？燈前月下？花叢柳蔭？山水亭樓？切磋琢磨？娱樂塲裏？患難途中？······</p>
<p>然而有一天黄金會有一根毫毛也不値，有一天戀愛會有一個人也不講；你看鴻濛開闢的原始時代不是如此麽？</p>

<h3>戀愛的苦酒</h3>
<p>— 紥微</p>
<p>戀愛，是靑年男女難免要走上的一條路程。但是過後思量，戀愛的滋味，並不見得都是甜蜜的；往往有許多人，因爲熱戀而所感到的　苦，比較失戀還要來得深刻，來得慘酷。艾霞女士，是一位時代的姑娘，更兼是一顆亮晶晶的明星，伊的文筆也很淸　，在最近，我們常常可以在報紙上或刋物上看到伊所寫的關於戀愛的文字，鞭辟入裏，的是，過來人經騐之談。伊又編成了一個電影劇本，自己充任主角，現在已經明星公司攝成影片了。片名「現代一女性」。内容的叙述，給沉迷在戀愛的夢中的靑年們以一個重大的掊擊。伊在「現代一女性」裏指示出戀愛是無謂的欺騙的，虚僞的，愛情是建築在金錢上面的，有爲的靑年，還是去努力自己的前程，不要在戀愛的，岐途上徬徨。因爲戀愛祇是人生的一小部份啊！</p>
<p>「現代一女性」已在本埠的各大電影院公映了。這是一杯戀愛的苦酒，我想靑年男女們該都願意去嘗一嘗　的滋味的吧？</p>
<h3>誰是爲藝術而藝術的</h3>
<p>— 劉四</p>
<p>我相信凡是藝術界的一份子，無論在盛大的集會或是二三知友閑談中；如果有人問他，「你是爲什麽而藝術的？」他必特别莊嚴的回答：。「我是爲藝術而藝術的」！</p>
<p>同時我又堅决的相信，藝術界中，眞正爲藝術而藝術的，不過是百分中之一二，也許這一二分中，還要打個折扣！而其餘百分之九八九，都是爲生活而藝術，爲金錢而藝術的！</p>
<p>胡蝶女士是個兼擅歌舞的影星，伊究竟是爲藝術而藝術，或是爲生活金錢而藝術？我並不敢武斷的肯定。但看伊近來唱了兩個人家所不敢唱不能唱關於國際社會的歌曲；可知伊雖没有離開爲了生活金錢而藝術的範圍，至少限度也該承認伊是半個爲藝術而藝術的。</p>
<p>伊的歌曲是：</p>
<p>㈠你不見「綠酒綠，紅燈紅，爵士如潮，靑春如夢，委　腰，舒皓腕，就像那楊柳隨風。你不見···親愛的先生哪！東北河山整個兒斷送！戰士血還灑满在上海吳淞！」</p>
<p>㈡最後一聲：「親愛的先生，感謝你殷勤，恕我心不靜，神不寗，這是我最後一聲；你對着這綠酒紅燈，也想到東北的怨鬼悲鳴！莫待明朝國破恨長存，先生今宵紅樓夢未醒，看四海沸騰！準備着，衝鋒陷敵陣，我再不能和你婆婆舞沉淪！再會吧，我的先生，我們得要戰爭！戰爭裏解放我們！拚得鮮血染遍大地，爲着民族爭最後光明！」</p>
<p>唱這樣悲將漓鼓勵國人抗敵救國的詞句，確已打破歌曲的新紀錄，密司胡的思想和見解，實在是高人一等啊！</p>
<p>這歌曲是由百代公司收音的，當灌片時，他們公司的經理，特地邀了一些愛好藝術的朋友前去參觀，我也是被邀者之一，因此又發見了胡蝶唱這歌曲時兩個特點：</p>
<p>㈠胡蝶的嗓音，本是淸脆而又能高能低能剛能柔的；這天歌唱時更覺得凄凉掛味，大槪總是「聚精會神」的原故。</p>
<p>㈡這兩個歌曲，都是用西洋音樂奏中國劇曲調的！你不見是「南梆子」，用的却是「爵士華而司」拍子，最後一聲是「二六」，用的却是Fox-trot跳舞曲，胡蝶唱時，處虚都能和音樂吻合，同時又能保持平劇的精采，這確是特别「難能可貴」的。</p>

<h3>敬謝開發</h3>
<p>— 鄭伯奇</p>
<p>自從東洋的親善朋友，從東北方面森來了巨砲以後，我們中國便有兩個大發明··一個是「長期抵抗」，早已世界聞名，這且不去說它：還有一個便是「開發西北」，這却是連中國的大多數人都還未曾明瞭的。筆者因爲故鄕關係，比较多曉得一點，所以不能不向大家宣揚一番。</p>
<p>你瞧，自從九一八以後，我們不是添了兩個都嗎城？死去了幾千年的長安·也變成了陪都。從此「開發西北」的呼聲便呌得和東北方面的砲聲同樣響亮。</p>
<p>許多要人到西北去，實業調查團到西北去，新聞記者到西北去，從來把西北看作菲洲大沙漠一般的上海難上的公子哥兒們也閙着到西北去。古時·孔子西行不入秦，二十世紀的摩登人物，畢竟是大有進步了。</p>
<p>在這樣　極提倡之下，若是西北依然閙着兵災饑　，那眞是西北自甘落後了。果然，據最近由那邊來的老鄕講，西北的情形的確和以前兩樣。市面上，黄金差不多是絕跡了，就連四鄕發掘出來的秦磚漢瓦都大漲價。中交鈔票在那兒眞有極大的「開發」作用。幾百年來藏在地窖裏的黄金到那兒去了呢？現在大約到紐約銀行的地下室中留學去了。至於秦磚漢瓦，目前雖不能就東去扶桑嘗嘗帝國博物館的風味，至少也可以在上海灘上看看光亮的電燈和巍峨的洋樓。這在没有見過世面的他們，當然是値得欣幸的事。</p>
<p>况且，這裏，還有着極其香艶的故事哩。</p>
<p>據說，某貴夫人有一次由西北某省她丈夫的任地乘飛機晉京，航空公司照例要量她的體重。大約這　公司是「花旂」招牌，所以，就是貴夫人也不能發揮她的嬌怒，祇好俯首貼耳讓人家去量。不料，不量猶可，一量之下，那位嬌小玲瓏，掌上可舞的夫人，居然有一百八十磅。也許你會疑心她肚裏有了小寳寳，其實她的肚及并没有大，不過腰肢粗了一些罷了。可怪的是，她回到南邊以後，上海的金價都曾發生了變動。</p>
<p>所以，我的許多老鄕對於「開發西北」這口號都有分害怕，他們覺得不開發還好，一開發便黄金與瓦礫都有出洋的份兒，這實在是不敢領情的事情。</p>

<p>剛才看到自由談上達伍先生關於拙著譯文的一點質疑，我自己也驚而且感。我譯書，雖然也相當謹愼，但疏忽實在是非常之多的。伊科維持的那本書，日譯出後我就和友人方天白兄合譯出來，當時我還弄到一本原文本，但我們的法文都只認識幾個字，所以除了人名書名補入之外，只有遇着日譯過於不懂的地方，才去細查一下原文。例如，創作機構一篇中的「埃及豆」，我就審愼了一下。書譯成後賣不出去，接着幾種譯本出來，原稿歸於無用。寫藝術論後才提出其中一篇作爲附錄，出没有去詳細看他。「三層樓」那一段文章譯得不對，我承認疏忽。日譯本譯文與戴望舒先生的譯文完全符合。日譯本上有很大的字，「那在三個階段上展開」。日本字和中國字相同，我不至「三階段」三字也不認識。但我當時看疏忽了，將「段」字看掉，於是成了「三階」，「三階」是日本「三層樓」的意思。所以錯誤是由將「三階段」看成了「三階」而來。然而出眞是失之毫厘，謬以千里了。</p>
<p>不過，關於「骨董」三字，達伍先生就可不必吹毛求疵。原文雖不在手頭。但戴先生譯作「長雜」。日譯作「骨董」，我也仍「骨董」二字，是不錯的。達伍先生一看「骨董」二字就連想到山東河南的「骨董」，其實「骨董」本義，本爲「零雜」之意，雜煑之食物，曰「骨董羹」。古物之作「骨董」，是後起之誼，蓋「古銅」三字之音轉也。達伍先生以爲「骨董」就非鑽土不可，何苦呢？</p>
<p>翻譯錯誤之來源，大槪有三：第一，强不知以爲知：第二不查字典，望文生義；第三，看錯看掉了字。像最後一種，我想是不應該受那麽嚴重的攻擊的。</p>
<h3>城隍廟禮讚</h3>
<p>林翼之</p>
<p>四五十部黄包車，接連的由小東門長驅西進，車上坐的都是高鼻子，藍眼睛的西洋人，據說是外國來的什麽觀光　，往城隍廟去觀光的。外國人畢竟聰明些，他知道沿外灘一帶的高大的白石房子，霞飛路的綠燈紅樓，都祇是上海的皮毛，要眞正的認識上海的心臓，就得上城隍廟去。</p>
<p>城隍廟裏薰　着濛濛的香烟，用鋼骨三和土重建的黄牆彫角的殿堂裏，巍然的坐着穿宋朝服裝的城隍菩薩，但是在他面前低首膜拜的，却是身洒巴黎香水，足踏花旗皮鞋，頭髮燙成一九三三式的摩登太太。她們倒是的確董得中學爲體，西學爲用的，也跟身坐福特飛機的將軍，還是一心禮賢下士，擺擂台召四海英雄，徴求飛　走壁人才，以便共赴國難的一樣。城隍廟是最大衆化的娱樂所。好像上海的高等華人有他們的明園，麗娃　妲村一樣，上海的低等華人，就有他們的城隍廟。三個五個銅子一本的小書，裏面有畫有字，請的都是俠客劍仙，路見不平，就會拔刀相助，在動不動就得吃外國火腿中國耳光的社會裏，這些英雄當然是極大的安慰，於是就有些商店裏的小夥計，立志到峩嵋山去修道，以便回來時向他的師父先生報仇雪恨，還可以打東洋人，救國。其次是六個銅板看一看大頭人，小頭人，蜘蛛精，這些東西，對於甚至化不起二毛錢到電影院看好萊塢大腿的人，是極好的代替品，　跟好萊塢大腿一樣，都可以使人忘記痛苦的現實，得到享樂的陶醉。</p>
<p>城隍廟又是大衆化的先施永安，祇有在玻璃櫃外望望百貨商店的大多數的上海人，在城隍廟可以满足他的慾望。兩角錢一隻的玻璃戒指，也會亮晶晶的發光，於是雖然看見金鋼鑽戴在别人的身上，但自己也可以拿玻璃光來安慰安慰，用不着對别人起什麽不平之感。</p>
<p>城隍廟更代替了皇家飯店和沙利文，據說常熟酒釀　子，南翔饅頭，白糖藕粥，麵筋百葉，那種滋味是遍天下找不到的，但城隍廟衰可以使你满足。黑漆漆的人羣，　满了黑漆漆的灘子，和着蒼蠅與一切細菌的種子，濁呑虎嚥的把這些美味送進饑餓的肚子裏去，培養起强有力的抗毒素，與病菌作長期抵抗。據說這就是中華民族獨特的延續種族的本領。</p>
<p>如果你有興緻，再跑上春風得意樓或湖心亭去喝茶，你更會認識中國民族性的偉大，臭氣騰騰的小便處傍，有人正在品茗淸談，或獨坐冥想，一片喧蒸的人聲熱汗之中，有人正在拉着胡琴奏樂，或吹着洞蕭訴情。有些人面對着行人雜踏的街巷，提着秀眼籠調嗓子，有些人拿着幾張小報，隨手抓一些五香南瓜子，甘草黄連頭送進嘴裏。</p>
<p>雖在閙市，如絕塵　，參透了這兒的三昧，　够得上做一個中華偉大國的順民。但是這種精神，據說也有來源，那便是城隍廟裏的一個湖。這湖上有九曲欄杆的九曲橋，橋底下流着泥湯一樣的水，被日光蒸發着，發着　黝黝的光面，放養一陣陣的惡臭。日本的文學家芥川龍之介，曾經親　看見有人在這湖裏放尿，其實比尿更釀惡萬分的東西，都望這湖裏丢。但這是列名在中國大觀裏的名勝佳境，（亦猶萬里長城雖被敲指爲「新興满洲」的新疆界，而在决心收復的决心之下，總還是中國的名勝一樣，）所以居住在這湖水裏的烏龜，依然相信自己是在名勝佳境裏，悠然自得地游來游去，有時候雖抬起頭來在水面上喘喘氣，或許出覺得惡濁得不好過，但一會見又把頭低下去，快活地　受下去了。</p>
<p>烏龜的這種偉大的精神，的確對中華民族作了偉大的貢獻。所以城隍廟最後還是一個上海民衆敎育館。</p>
<p>怪不得幾年前被火燒了一次，許多　　先生都慷慨解嚢，立刻把他重建起來了，更怪不得到上海來觀光的西洋人，首先要觀光城隍廟！</p>
<h3>旱象</h3>
<p>— 一非</p>
<p>王老四立在塘路上，出神地瞧着乾涸到見了底的水塘，和等待雨水下稻的自己的田地，他只好無可奈何的嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>初夏的陽光，巳是火辣辣地曬在他底背脊上，使他不斷的流着汗，高而靑的天空，全没有一些兒雨意。</p>
<p>「是的，天也變了下季節只剛交了夏，天就這麽長久的晴起來！」王老四這樣自言自語着，儘在塘路上徘徊。</p>
<p>確實，這是近年來從不曾有的事，剛種稻的時候，也會閙起旱災來！</p>
<p>—固然，自己的稻田是太近山野，麥子成熟太慢，所以要下稻的時候，附近的水塘都者涸了。但是，照這樣的晴下去，就是已經種了，又有什麽用呢？不想着，想着，王老四又記起了去年的事：</p>
<p>—去年不是「風調雨順」「五糓豐登」的年頭嗎？可是，榖價的賤跌，却反而使終年在泥土中掙扎生存的自己，欠下了一筆大債：本來满想在今年來「反本」的，然而，今年的結果，誰又能預料呢？在剛開始種稻的時候，便這麽長久的晴</p>
<p>起來，閙着旱災了！</p>
<p>—啊—這永遠使窮人們爲難的年頭！我們這些安分守己的農夫們唯一的報酬，眞的就只有貧困，疾病，和饑餓麽？······</p>
<p>他不斷的想着，在熱燥的空氣中，汗流满了他的全身；抬頭瞧瞧天，天空依舊是高而靑，全没有一些兒雨意。</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— JulcsKenard作林取譯</p>
<p>蝌蚪</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚一個人在院子裏頑着，他站在院子中間，好呌雷辟克家的能够從窗户監視着他。當他的朋友勒米跑來時，他正在規規矩矩地頑着。勒米是一個和他同年齡的孩子，他雖是一個跛子，但他却老是要跑，因而他左邊那隻壞脚常是掉在另一隻後面，永遠趕　不上。他提着一隻籃子說道：</p>
<p>「你来嗎，紅蘿蔔鬚？爸爸把麻浸在河裏。我們去帮他，就便用籃子去捕蚪蝌。」</p>
<p>「你去問我媽媽罷，」紅蘿蔔鬚說。</p>
<p>勒米—爲什麽要我去問呢？</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚—因爲我去間，她不會矣許的。</p>
<p>恰好這時雷辟克家的探首在窗口上望着。</p>
<p>「雷辟克太太，我把紅蘿蔔鬚帶去捕蝌蚪好不好？」勒米說。</p>
<p>電辟克家的把耳朶貼在玻璃上。勒米再把上面的話呌說了一遍。電辟克家的聽懂了。我們看見她張動着嘴唇。兩個小朋友什麽都没有聽見，只好蹟躇不决地對看着。可是雷辟克家的這時搖着頭，淸淸楚楚地表示不許了。</p>
<p>「她不答應，」紅蘿蔔鬚說。「她一定馬上就有什麽事情要我做的。」勒米—眞可惜，不然大家可以痛痛快快地頑一塲的。她不答應，她不答應。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚—留在這　罷。我們在這裏一塊頑。</p>
<p>勒米—啊！不，誰肯這樣。我是寗願去釣蝌蚪的。天氣很温和。我可以釣到满满的幾籃。紅蘿蔔鬚—稍爲等一等。媽媽常常起初拒絕。有時候後來又改變宗旨的。</p>
<p>勒米—我稍爲一刻切夫，但不能再多的。</p>
<p>兩個人把手插在口袋裏，一齊站在那兒，鬼頭鬼腦地盯牢着扶梯，一會兒紅蘿蔔鬚便用肘推着勒米說：</p>
<p>「你看我說的何如？」</p>
<p>眞的，門開了，雷辟克家的手裏拿着一隻預備給紅蘿鬚的籃子，往下走了一步。但她猶疑着停住了。</p>
<p>「嘿，你遠在這裏，勒米·我以爲你走了。我以後要告訴你爸爸，說你在外面打野，他會駡你的。」</p>
<p>勒米—這是紅蘿蔔鬚要我等他的。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的—啊！眞的嗎，紅蘿蔔鬚？</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚旣不承認，也不否認。他不知道要怎樣做了。他是澈底了解雷辟克家的，他又把她猜中了一次。可是勒米這蠢東西旣把好好的事情完全弄糟了，紅蘿蔔鬚對於這事的結局便丢了不管。他用脚蹂躪着地上的靑草，眼睛瞧着别處。</p>
<p>「但我似乎並没有改口的習慣呢，」雷辟克家的說。（未完）</p>

<p>麥昨日期麥市面、見暴落之象、因天已轉晴、各路新麥紛寄新樣麥品較之往年大見進步、且以各廠尙有巨額洋麥、新麥時令、决不致如往年之爭競、必須廉宜之時、方動胃口、因此人心極度虚疲、行家及客户均見暢出、多頭回出者亦甚覺可觀、致六七兩月、均跌破四元關口、照最近情形、近期標準恐須一見八九角之低價矣、結果本月仍開三元九角六分無比價、七月份較前週暴落八分、八月份落九分、九月份落八分、十月份落五分、十一月份落八分、現麥到源尙不暢、昨開和州麥一千五百包、價四元、由申大·華豐·阜豐辦云云、</p>
<p>洋客秈銷化又活</p>
<h3>福州温州天津均有問訊</h3>
<p>昨日洋客秈市尙活潑、因本客各帮均有問津、客帮中除福州帮繼續暢辦外、温州與天津去胃亦香、天津帮久無問訊、昨辦去湖南機紅米五百包、此後如裝銷合划、或有續辦之希望、温州帮辦去南　　米二百七十包、南京　米二百八十三包、江北米四百包、無錫米七百包、福州去江西米二百二十包、湖南米一千八百五十包、本帮辦去一號西貢一百包、又小絞二百包爲温州辦去、所開價格均與上週相似、祇小絞米比上週洋商售價小一角、但比回籠售開者反好一角云、</p>

<h3>疋頭麻膠布暢銷西服帮</h3>

<h3>小人之心</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>近来眞有點迫害狂，心裏老是惴惴焉的想着，「来了」，「這回可來了」，而不很安然。雖然自身還没有受到若何迫害，但從我的前後左右隱隱地看来，便覺得這「來了」之感，不是没由來。眞的，在這變態的中國，頗不容易，頗不容易使你往好處想。在我想像中的將来，可喜的成分，實在比可怕的成分要少得少，總覺得像有臨晚時的神情一樣，暮色從四面襲來，更黑暗的局面，就要在眼前展開，於是我恐怖了。說來未免有點「小人之心」，但事實實迫你，不敢有所希望。在前幾天應了友人之約，到江灣去看飛機表演，對駕駛者那種宛轉如意的飛行技術，確使我的點感動，據說航空協會已定購了戰鬭機十八架，——我也是二元老板之一，可不管——也無法管這些閒賬，但不問是否是股東老板，設想權總是有的。我想倘能駕着就這十八架飛機，飛到東京大阪去報復一點滬戰時的損害，與東北人民的寃仇，未始不是一件快意的事，但一想到我們是「苦命的中國人」，便立刻收住這念，覺得這樣想法，實在有點過於放肆時代已至二十世紀，飛機原爲文明國所應有，以爲盛世的點綴，但用之於供要人乘坐，或在空中環城三週，普及到一般有錢的人擴擴眼界，也是好的，而我們呢？也有得鑑賞鑑賞的機會，但是現在時局又有點變化，大槪所担心的「来了」終於要來了，那即使你不很安然，也屬無法的事。在這騒然的時局中，飛機自到用武的時候了，炸彈究竟向那一方而落，雖不可知，尾巴的不向内，則可斷言。雖然所有希望的這是「小人之心，度君子之腹」，原無傷於日月，倘不幸而言中，那便是意想不到的糟糕。</p>

<h3>飯店西施</h3>
<p>— 勇士</p>
<p>阿珍又把晚飯送來了。</p>
<p>爲了凶飯問題，大家眞覺得麻煩，出了大價錢，吃不到好東西。「包飯不是人吃的！」他們常時爲了包飯問題，大發其牢騒。</p>
<p>因爲各人意見不一致，現在趙上元和全生淘三四個人。另外合成一小組，包在後面三十三衖裏合興小包飯作裏吃。合興範圍不大，除了老板和老板娘外，就是一位老板的小姐。名字呌阿珍。此外還雇着一個夥計。因爲人手不多，近段小桌頭包飯，總是阿珍自己出来送的。阿珍今年十九歲，雖然不一定長得怎樣嬌嫩，却也生得苗條得可以，白白的臉兒，襯上一對烏光雪亮的眼睛，紅紅的嘴唇，細細的眉毛，無一處不顯示其少女美。尤其是兩條腿子，和兩條臂膀，長得特别肥白。雪白的細簿麻紗襪，裹着兩條小腿，綳得貼緊，簡直就要炸裂。裏面隱隱露出粉紅的肉色，動一動似乎就有一陣肉香飄過来。這幾條衖堂裏的幾個年輕小夥子，於是就共同給她上個尊號，呌作「飯店西施」。附近幾家小店裏年輕朋友，大家都想吊她膀子，阿珍也眞浪，她總不怕這班年輕朋友的厮纒。</p>
<p>全生也是埀涎着阿珍的一個。現在有他們包飯給合興，又剛巧是阿珍自己来送飯，這對於全生自然是一個好機會雖然包了飯還不過三五天，但據全生進行的結果，成績很不壞。</p>
<p>吃飯時有趙上元等幾個有年紀人在</p>
<p>座，全生是未便放肆。他只用眼睛偷偷溜過去看阿珍。阿珍很自然地靠着窗子，看他們吃飯，她知道全生在偷看她，水汪汪的眼晴，接着對全生就帶上一絲微笑。全生禁不起阿珍這一來，心頭頓時撲撲的一陣跳，耳朵裏只覺得呼呼的發響。</p>
<p>全生很快的吃完了飯。今天他是再也忍耐不住了。他很快的走到後門弄角裏，這裏適巧没有裝電燈，地方很暗，來往人又少，據全生看來，正是一個攔路邀截的再好没有處所。不知後事如何只得問了全生再講，</p>
<p>這不是吃包飯的特别利益麽</p>
<h3>小三子的家</h3>
<p>— 樂基</p>
<p>滬北某區有一個範圍很大｝不是規模很大｝｜的貧民窟。一叢叢碎磚石和泥砌成的牆，草柴和蘆片雜蓋成頂的屋子，遠望過去眞不會想到是呼吸尚存的人生活的地方，倒好像另一世界人安身的墳墓。裏面的居民十之八九都是拉洋車或獨輪車的朋友。吾們的小三子也是内中的一個，現在吾就請他出來做一個代表，以見這裏生活情形的一斑</p>
<p>他的屋子總共不到二丈見方的一間，而他全家五口的飲食起臥就都在這裏面了。除了朝南一扇須灣身進出的大門而外，在北邊總算還開着一個直徑不满一尺似圓非圓的洞，在門關在住了的時候還可以透進一些光來。上面的屋頂早已失去功用，祇擋了陽光的駕，風雨倒反可自由的侵入。下起雨來總是弄得满屋是水，冷不提防吃上還要被雨淋醒了好夢。這樣一個地方恐怕呌狗來往還要嫌不衛生呢，然而他們不住這裏又往那裏去？加了他們整天的在外面爲生活而掙扎更没餘暇再來顧及屋子的整理。一張蹺了脚的桌子，二張破竹椅子，一具缺口的缸灶，二張破木片桌成的高低不平的床舗，毫無地位的東西雜置着。更有幾隻顏色發了黝黑的碗盞，破臺，臉盆以及木片，鐵罐子之類散得隨處都是。满屋子的雜亂的狀態，汚穢的顏色，霉蒸的氣味，你進去一分鐘保你要作三日嘔呢，然而他們倒好像安之有素從不會加以厭惡，衛生這一個觀念更是他們所不會有的。</p>
<p>在白天，這屋子總是關得靜靜的，因爲他們的全家總是一早的就總動員出發上生活的征程非到日落西山是不會回來的。他自己是拉洋車，他妻子是缝窮的，一個女兒就跟着她母親帮帮忙，兩個兒子亦整天的背着竹箕在外面拾荒，他們眞是自食其力，分工合作的一個人家。各人的面容上雖不免都刻着深深的和生活苦鬥的痕跡，然而有時候也會看見他門的兒子們各人捧着一碗黄米飯，上面放着一塊鮮紅的如醬猪肉之類的東西在很满的微笑中吃着。這大慨可以知道他們這幾天的生意一定還不差或是他們的兒子拾得了些什麽値錢的東西了。這時候他們的快樂就是公子王孫恐怕也會及不到罷！</p>
<h3>啓我的事</h3>
<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>記得看過一張「五十年後之新世界」，人名已完全用Signal等呼號代替，雖然是＂JustLmangine。然而人名倒底是一個記號而已。張三李四，不過使人說起張三就是一個瘦長子；說起李四就是一個矮胖子，浮在眼前是了。如其像蔣介石只說蔣委員長，張學良，被喚張不抵抗，也因爲後者的稱呼已人盡皆知，差不多已成了他們的記者。想不到本人被死去的父親題名「萍」字，在這年頭兒也時髦起來，每一本雜誌，每一張附刋，都有「萍」字的發見，而新聞報附刋上更有同署「一萍」的名字，自己旣不敢掠人之美，又不肯把二十五年來相隨的「萍」字更變。在左右爲難的時候，昨日（九日）申報上又發現了一條「一萍鑒」的廣告，害我的朋友們都趕到我的小樓來問我怎樣一回事。報上登的是：「得信星夜趕來，杭京遍找無着，歸衢則坐臥不安，留杭則假期將满，若再遲誤，公私俱傷，豈汝始料所及，幸見報即遠歸來」等語，我再恐有更甚的發見，於是忍痛犧牲，將二十五年來相隨的「萍」改作「蘋」。朋友們請認明商標，庶不致誤。（却酬）</p>
<h3>飢餓的力量</h3>
<p>— 達人</p>
<p>飢餓眞有不可思議的驚人的力量祇要你一天不吃，你的腹子就會和你搗亂，無論你的意志是如何的堅强，都弄得你頭眩眼花，手脚無力，非找尋點什麽東西來安慰那空虚的腹子不可了。在這時候祗要能安慰，鎭壓那搗亂的腹子的話，什麽方法，什麽手段都可以擇了。不論法律是如何的嚴峻，警政是如何周到，道德是如何的維繫人心的工具，在飢餓的面前都失掉他的效力，法律，警政，道德，我覺得祇是束縛飽食暖衣的平庸的人，决不能束縛那如虎如狼呑噬一切的飢餓的人羣的：「君子窮困」這句話，我覺得祇是白紙上的黑字，事實上並没有這麽一回事。祇要飢餓降臨到他的身上，所謂什麽有道德，有良心的安份守己的人都一一反其所爲了。「倉廪實而知禮節，」「衣食足而知榮辱，」這二句話是千古至理的。　　時常聽聞「賣兒鬻女」的呼聲，與「易子而食」慘劇，巳是極人世之慘酷了，但誰知二年前甘陜災荒時，竟有「刖愛子瘦腿以爲中飯，刳嬌妻之乳頭權作晚餐」者呢！嬌妻愛子尙刖之刳之，至其他徒具虚文的法律，和口頭說空話的道德人心，更用不着了。</p>
<p>飢餓眞是有不可思議的驚人的力量啊！她如海濤一樣的咆哮着要掩没一切，　牠如獅子一樣的怒吼着要呑噬一切！現在中國的大衆不都是陷在飢寒交迫的悲慘狀態裏嗎？</p>
<p>媳婦是好的！</p>
<h3>兒子是要的！</h3>
<p>編者先生</p>
<p>貴欄好如馬路上的紅綠交通燈。自誕生以来，不知解决了多少問題。我有一件兒孫之事。要請敎先生一下。想你一定不會推諉的。事實是這樣的：我是一個綢布店裏的老司賬，有兩個兒子，小的還在中學讀書，大的今年二十二歲了。在民國十八年，就替他娶了一門親事，那時他倆感情未見不洽。不久，吾兒因家境困難，故於十九年初，就投身軍界，現在某軍政治處服務。平日每月總有兩封信歸家，最少也有一次。今年因他的祖母病重，想他歸家一次，不料竟大失所望。回信是這樣說的「非與賢賣式之婚姻，宣告脫離，莫想兒歸家，並且從此以後，終止給信，以表兒之决心，侯復」等語。至今果然三四個月，没有信了。在我看來，一定什麽自由戀愛迷惑了。編者先生，這件事，呌我氣也不氣。他的她，在家作事，極耐苦，</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>思想又靈致，家中事務　全靠她一人主持。並且毫無摩登女子的奢華習氣。這樣看來，呌我怎麽好　　呢　　　　　不和她脫離，可恨的兒子，一定不會覺悟的。假如與他脫離，不但良心上道德上說不過去，法律上亦不會准許的。在這左右爲難之下，如何使可恨的兒子覺悟，是否可以和她脫離？想先生知識廣大，一定會替我解决的。完了，祝你編安吳申武謹啓</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者按：在我們看來，這件事，在吳君並不難處。兒媳間的離與不離，純粹是他們自身的事情，你非但無權顧問，而且你要管，也管不了許多。他們願離，媳婦雖好，你不能强留：他們不願應當去信令郎，說明離婚大事，須得親自回來商洽，爲父的不能代勞。一面將令郎來信，交與令媳，使她知道丈夫的態度。令郎得信後，歸與不歸，祇可聽其自便罷了。令媳方面，她所取的態度，有下列三種，均屬合法的。㈠她可以根據來信，向法院狀請脫離，另行嫁人：並可提出要求損害賠償的保留。㈡她可以　法院以　　　　訴　　　　　　訴，可向　婚所在地的該管法院爲之，經受　後，可由該法院，行文令郎執業所在地的法院協助。不過這種手續，每每有擱置不行的困難，所以她有力量的話，她可以赴令郎目下所屬的法院，或軍事法庭控訴，較爲有力。㈢她認痛不發。仍在尊府，如無其事的話。這樣她與令郎的夫婦關係，繼續存在，任何時候，令郎回来，她可以提起遺棄或重婚之訴。上面的第二辦法，當然最硬性，希望她不要出此。第三辦法，表面似乎柔和，但是與你「想兒子回來」的願望絕對衝空。所以你不妨在將令郎原信，交與令媳的，表示這一個願望。她要是答允了，那麽離是離定了，令郎也肯回來了，所餘的賠償問題，自有令郎負擔的。不過離婚的事，以洽議爲最妥，定要對簿公庭，未免乏味；所以要好令郎回来，對而洽商。這層，你去信令郎時，務須切實反覆說明。</p>
<p>我們對於離婚，素來主張與其同牀異夢，不如乾脆離開。但是對於任意遺棄，主張要負相當的責任。</p>
<p>更正因爲作者的粗心，不曾詳細註明原稿的頁數，以致次序錯亂。所以一聽說第八節缺了一頁，立刻臨時補上一段。誰知又這一段其後又在第十節中刋出。茲更正如次：第八節二十六行的「不知在什麽時候，······」至「······也好，就嫁給他罷」，請讀者棄去。第十節十二行「不上眼這樣」以下的「得動顫，心裏想··」至「好，就嫁給他罷」爲止，補入第入節的空白。至於第八節二十五行最後的「得動顫，也就算了」數字，亦請除去，然後連成「但因爲懶解動顫」之句。而第十節十二行「不上眼這樣」緊接同節第二十三行「這一個妖精······」慚愧得很，茲於更正之外，敬向讀者和編者道歉一</p>

<h3>五姬的一生㈢㈩㈠（續）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>二十八，復仇（二）</p>
<p>突然張文彬從裏面風流文雅的走出來，恭而且敬的向二位巨頭分别鞠躬。然後很從容的將一捲文件授給蘇耕雲。再將一册珂羅版印刷品翻開來給他們看了幾頁。說：</p>
<p>「文件原稿，當然原物奉還，不過像這樣的一本，到底應當留着作紀念品，因爲這是中國外交中最珍貴的寶物，也是二位熱心愛國的鐵證。」</p>
<p>一次風波，從此又是太平無事了。</p>
<p>二十九，革命成功之後</p>
<p>從此又過了許多年，直到五夫人已經二十七歲的時候，算起來中國革命成功，已經有五年之久了。旣然已經革命過了，少不了政府方面一定要大大的改變一下，當然蘇部長也說是不高興和革命黨往來，於是這便是革命以後最顯著的政績之一。再說得明顯一點的話，那末正如武貴所說：「一個國家没有皇帝已經不成話了，誰知現在却連大總統也不用了，只有一個主席。「主席」，單就聲調上也就不夠響亮。何况有着皇宮寳殿的北京不去建都，而偏要由武漢搬到南京，南京搬到洛陽，洛陽又搬回來，簡直是小孩兒們閙着玩兒似的。總而言之，這幾年來眞是越來越不成樣子了，甚至於將北京改成北平。而且東北四省已經讓盤給日本了。」</p>
<p>當然，像武貴這一流的人，能夠懂得什麽那裏懂得衙門裏的奥妙。不過他雖然這樣的一個人胡思亂想，到底還不曾捉去坐牢，這大槪因爲民權早已有了保障的在故。</p>
<p>然而也有一點使武貴很爲高興的，那便是張大少爺居然在外交部由一等秘書陞爲情報司長了。所以五夫人满心快樂，武貴跟着快樂，還有一個荷香也在暗暗的快樂。正因爲張文彬不能常常離開南京的原故，於是五夫人新近在湯山買了一幢洋房，算是避暑的别墅。</p>
<p>至於蘇耕雲老爺却還是和從前一樣忙碌，雖然不肯正式上台再做部長，可以國難旣經發生，也就少不了要出來帮忙帮忙，重要的外交案件，總還要出出主意。</p>
<p>不過這幾年來畢竟又老了許多，五夫人這邊也很少有興緻常常跑來，但是遵照「協定」，按月結她十萬元，總還得由臺灣銀行照付。</p>
<p>所以，假使我們給他設身處地的想一想，那末這位年高德厚的老頭子，確是太可憐了。</p>
<p>有一次，蘇部長很高興的從北京來到上海除了國事之外自然也想來和五夫人親近親近。這一天他又新買了兩件衣料送她，興高彩烈的陪着五夫人住了幾天，夏天的日子雖長，到也很快樂的容易過去。昨夜賭了一晚回力球，不免非常疲倦，雙雙的一直睡到下午，他又出主意要去看梅老板自美國得了博士回來所演的「荒山涙」了。誰知下午四點鐘五夫人坐在梳妝臺上忽然接着張文彬自南京拍來的電報，敎她立刻夜車晋就。於是她一面敎女僕收拾衣箱，一面告訴老頭子說：</p>
<p>「我現在要到南京去一趟，你好好的在家裏住幾天，我們改天再去看戲罷。」</p>
<p>「但是，」他氣惱的說：「我路遠迢迢的自北平跑來，你難道不能好好陪我玩幾天嗎？」</p>
<p>「那不成，人家有事去，誰管得看？」</p>
<p>可憐他一聽着這句話，又祇好不作聲了。</p>

<h3>好來塢思想中「忒克諾克拉西」（下）</h3>
<p>— 竹仙</p>
<p>論到好萊塢這班明星們，對於忒克諾克拉西（Tecbnoracy）的態度，我們先須記住他們的背景。好萊塢的大明星，個個都是倖運兒。他們的收獲，每星期多的亦可以到一二萬美金。所以要他們放棄了現在優越的地位，去和别人一樣地工作，做了一年，纔得到二萬美金，那他们當然是不願意的。可是好萊塢裏面，還有許多工作人等，他們辛苦終年，所得不及大明星一天的收入，虖於這種大軒輊，大不平均情勢之下，他們的感想怎樣呢？我們且從各方面來測騐一下。</p>
<p>有一天在璧克泛耳，就是范朋克與璧克福的住所，聚集了許多明星們。茶餘飯後，小范朋克就和却利卓别靈提起了「贊成不贊成」「忒克諾克拉西」的問題。小范說「凡關乎「忒克諾克拉西」的書籍，差不多我都看過了。我的意思是行不通的。什麽道理呢？因爲照我看來，「忒克諾克拉西」，是一種平均人類的空想。這是我以爲是辦不到的。這種理想，往往在紙面上很好聽，等實行的時候，就不興了。」</p>
<p>一回兒老范朋克亦加入討論了。他說「我的兒子知道的。或者比我多些。但我是一個不可救藥的樂觀者。無論「忒克諾克拉西」行得通，行不通，世界總會改進的。在我個人方面。這件事倘使是有益於大衆的，我亦當然是贊成的。却利卓别靈說：「我對於蘇俄的五年計劃，已有深切的研究。「忒克諾克拉西」雖是完全不同的一種理想，但據我看來，亦不見行容易成功吧。但世界現在進步的速率，是很可驚的。我深信三年之後，必定有一個新世界，新文明。我希望我們將來能如在南太平洋巴里海島上一樣，度着那鳥託邦的生活」傑克奥開說「什麽。我攢了這許多年的錢怎麽辦呢？倘「忒克諾克拉西」施行了，世上的愚人，越變越多了。慘澹經營四個字，亦完全失去意味了。人們亦不用奮鬥上進了。」李曲賽聽見了，連忙糾正地說「金錢是人生惟一個目的嗎。誠然金錢是極重要的，但是不能說人類除了金錢之外，就没有别的野心了。即如名譽的野心·····。」</p>
<p>琪恩哈羅發愁了。她說「忒克諾克拉西」施行之後，難道女子都穿同一樣的衣裳嗎？這是我很不贊成的。我喜歡穿些别緻的衣服。」還有一位打字的露茜說「嘎，兩萬塊錢一年很不差呀。我贊成的！」還有一位賣報童子，亦喊忒克諾克拉西，」要满了二十五歲纔工作，我贊成極了。還有一個電燈匠，他說「我做電燈匠，先要學習六年的電氣工程，所得不過幾塊錢一個禮拜。而他（指一位明星）連敎育多没有受過，一個禮拜拿幾千塊錢。這太不平均了。讓專家來處理這種事情，就不至於顚三倒四了。</p>
<p>可是有一位七塊半錢一天的臨時演員，居然反對起來。他說我辛辛苦苦，一天賺七塊半錢。但是我有我的前程，我爲那前程而努力奮鬥。倘使一切都平均了，我亦失去了我奮鬥的目標。我生活的意味減少了。（完）</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>觀「淸白」後</h3>
<p>— 徐海容</p>
<p>演出方面，開始就陷於不妥；十八年前的事，何必用書面來叙明呢？這樣的拍法，反而更使觀衆看了不懂：例如在魏光探獄出來後接着就是琵琶自街頭回家，如果我們起先没有看說明書，簡直會使我們摸不着頭腦，坐在我後面有二個女郎，當影片映到這裏時，我聽見她們頻頻的自相問道：「這是誰？這是誰？」由此足見如此攝法的不妥。</p>
<p>各演員的做作，我以爲太文明戲化了：他們的動作，都不見得很自然，尤其是韓蘭根的舞塲經理，實在演得太荒謬，形容過甚了，所以處處都失眞。上海公司的攝影和佈景，是很出品的，在本片裏依然保持牠固有的聲譽，有幾個鏡頭，眞拍得好，例如海濱的幾幕，使人看了會起一種無名的美感，導演也用了不少的小聰敏，可以說是成功的，結束的一場，極見巧妙，也是値得稱許的。</p>
<h3>觀「虎嘯獅吼」後</h3>
<p>— 堃明</p>
<p>滑稽短片後，「虎嘯獅吼」正片就星開跌了。全片形勢皆甚緊張，尤爲克萊特訓練時之數幕最佳而獅虎猛鬥時之一幕「虎嘯獅吼」獸毛飛翔實爲可懼；滑稽之串插亦甚相適。</p>
<p>男主角克萊特皮愛提ClydeBeatty表演時雖在虎獅怒目注視危急一髮之下，態度仍鎭靜泰然；女配角愛妮泰潘琪AnitaDage雖一美艶之紅星，唯在此劇中不能盡表其才實埋沁英才，終括說一句這是値得一看的，實勝於「人獸奇觀」「人猿泰山」等之獸片。</p>

<p>我的小寶貝，寶貝快快睡；晚上睡得早，天亮早起來。寶貝眞可愛，臉兒像玟瑰。我的好心肝！心肝小寶貝！寶貝迷眼，心肝快快睡！寶貝！</p>
<p>但是她的小妹妹（袁美雲飾）也運轉着她的婉轉的歌喉，不讓她姊姊專美，唱出活潑和快樂的蝶和蜂的歌來：</p>
<p>蝴蝶兒，飛飛飛，飛到東，飛到西，飛人花中便着迷！花做枕頭葉做被，多麽快活，多麽寫意·呵·冬天到了，葉落花飛，蝴蝶兒失了憑依，忍着凍，耐着飢，好不慘悽！</p>
<p>蜜蜂兒，嗡嗡嗡，飛到西，飛到東，苦苦辛辛做着工，有時備着無時用，營巢釀蜜，忙着勞働。呵！冬天到了，風冷霜濃，蜜蜂兒安住巢中，糧食足，暖烘烘，快樂無窮！</p>
<h3>再談「除夕」</h3>
<p>— 禮垣</p>
<p>現在談「除夕」似乎失了時間性吧！然而它給我的印像很佳，不談好像辜負了它。</p>
<p>看過大飯店，我驚奇着金元國金錢的神通，會把世間人心之險惡，世途之艱險，在一日短短的時間裏，盡情的暴露無遺；然而看過聨華公司的「除夕」，使我更驚嘆我國電影事業進步之神速。這張片子，的確可與「舶來品」大飯店相媲美。</p>
<p>「除夕」裏的鏡頭運用，眞難能可貴。如老翁（劉繼羣）拾得手皮夾，初則喜，繼而疑—遲疑，在這個當兒，聰明的導演，用他（老翁）往而復返，退而復進的脚步表現出來，加以適當的光線，很可以抓住觀衆的心緒緊張。片中打電話的幾幕，穿插得很好，表演最佳的，要算劉繼羣了。心情緊張，心緖麻亂的幾幕，他都能表現出。如能努力，前途正未可限量。</p>
<p>韓蘭根在「都會的早晨」裏已給我們相當的認識；在這片裏上鏡頭的機會很少，不過當富人（邢少梅飾）擲酒杯時，</p>
<p>韓君的一驚，大有卓别麟風態；有時還嫌過火，如能改正，不難與卓别麟並駕齊驅，望韓君勉之。</p>
<h3>談「春水情波」</h3>
<p>— 孟淦</p>
<p>在電影界所謂「轉變作風」後的國產片，的確是走入了生氣勃勃的大道。如聨華的：「三個摩登女性」，「城市之夜」，「都會的时晨」：明星的「狂流」，「脂粉市塲」；都是「改變作風後的佳作。而明星公司則尤其注意到一切女子的問題，這「春水情波」也是一部討論女子問題的作品。</p>
<p>在這裏它暴露了官場的黑幕，資產階級者的兇惡，他提出了到西北去的口號，並且：給了那些玩弄女性的纨袴子弟們，一個重大的警愓，所以這「春水情波」是一部明星公司的佳作。</p>
<p>在導演的持巧方面，鄭正秋覺得是退步了些，因爲太疏忽了，但在游湖等數幕，還得到了相當的成功。</p>
<p>在演員的表情方面，要以胡蝶爲最自然貼體，她是成功的。嚴月閒，胡萍，均無功過。但是孫敏，比「前程」中是退步得多了，表情太嫌生梗勉强。他是一個可造的後生，還希望他努力吧！總之，這是一部優良，進步的作品是値得賞鑒的。</p>
<h3>好萊塢反攻蕭伯納</h3>
<p>— 有基</p>
<p>蕭伯納在紐約嘗經說過：「電影是宣傳無政府主義的，因爲它表演英雄們往往拿自己的拳頭來解决一切糾紛，而並不訴諸法律的，因此好萊塢有幾個明星們裝得很勇毅的來替他們自己辯護，而反攻蕭伯納的話了。</p>
<p>「蕭先生忘了世界上還有願意公平戰鬥的人了。」凱弗倫雪斯小姐說。凱小姐是一個拳迷，（並非歡喜打拳，乃是歡喜看打拳的迷。）又是一個女演員詹姆士賈格納賞經在影片中做過很多的滑稽的事情，他對那著名的戲劇家說：「只有看滑稽戲的人，會設想去呌警察來解决那些糾紛的。」</p>
<p>戲的，更加爲好萊塢辯護得起勁，回敬了一個大砲，希望蕭伯納能夠聽到。他生活上，並不是每一個人遇到了困難就去呌警察的。」</p>
<h3>電影小說MaedcheninUniform（八）</h3>
<p>— 欣俯</p>
<p>日耳曼影片公司出品全班女演員聨合主演</p>
<p>裴柏打從大廳上走過，看見曼尼拉獨個子斜倚在牆壁上，鳴咽而泣，不由心酸起來，就走將過去，對她說道：「不必哭，你到我房裏去候着，我有話對你說，」不多一會，裴柏進尼，看見曼尼拉已帶着悲容等在那裏了，兩人面面相虚了好一會，還是裴柏先開口說：「曼房拉，她們預備要開除你，你知道嗎？</p>
<p>曼尼拉接着問道：「那麽我還能够和你相見不能呢？」裴柏遲疑了一會，把面孔對着墻壁，然後回答道：「我當然不能再見你了！」曼尼拉聽見了這句話，面色頓時蒼白起来，兩手抱着自己的頭，喊着道：不能見面！呌我怎能够再活下去！」</p>
<p>裴柏聽見了曼尼拉的話，不　急起來了，她就回過頭來，很嚴肅的喊着道：「曼尼拉，你自己應該要有把握，你應該要治療······」曼尼拉這時是已經變成了涙人了，但猶勉强打起精神來問裴柏：「治療什麽？」裴柏說：「治療你的狂戀病，」曼尼拉知道她是終於失望了！前途是不會再光明了！她最心愛的人是不能再愛她了！她也不說什麽。她把頭點點，立起來跑出去了。曼尼拉出房以後，裴柏暗想有些不妙，她急急衝出房來，高喊着「曼尼拉」。忽然和校長在門前闖一個满懷。她也就含怒對着校長說道：「你要知道我對她說什麽嗎？來吧！」於是校長和裴柏，就在房裏辯駁起來。校長說：「我的學校裏是不許有革命思想的。」裴柏說：「我辭職就是了。我不忍看見這小娘們，終日不樂。」但是這個時候，曼尼拉却和失了魂　似的，朝最高的一層樓上跑去，嘴裏還禱告着：上帝啊，天堂上想不會這樣黑暗吧！我要離開這　　的世界了！我不能再生存下去了！」可憐的曼尼拉，她心裏除掉一個死的念頭以外，是什麽都没有了。</p>
<p>在寄宿舍裏，曼尼拉的同學，因爲不看見她回來，到處找尋，可是那裏找得到呢。還有幾位和她要好的同學哭起來了。於是「曼尼拉」「曼尼拉」的呼喊聲，呌人聽了發頗的警鐘聲跳　動了全校，校中情狀，一時混亂不堪。最後同學們發現着曼尼拉，正在打算從那高按上，下，愈加駭得狂呼起來，這時裴柏在房裏聽見呼喊聲，急忙跑出来看，恰巧看見學生們將曼尼拉救出險境，她的神志是昏迷了，睡在同學們的懷抱中，一句話也說不出口。那些學生們，看見裴柏，走過來吧她團團圍住。裴柏不禁抽了一口冷氣，說道：「好得同學們救了曼尼拉的生命，否則這個慘劇，是會永遠印在我們的腦筋裏了！」這個時候，那神聖不可侵犯的校長，也好像有些覺悟了。她扶着手杖，縐着眉頭，一步一步的走下樓梯去，全塲頓時寂靜如死。於是這一幕悲劇，又在那如訴如幕的鐘聲中，告一段落了。（完）</p>

<h3>Resolving the Issue of Puppet Troops</h3>
<p>The Japanese Military Sends Kita Tsuyoshi</p>
<p>The Wartime Organization of Various Armies in North China Concludes</p>
<p>No Japanese Traces Remain Within Tong County</p>
<p>From Changchun, the Kwantung Army in Beiping dispatched Colonel Staff Officer Kita to Tianjin. Xiong Bin is waiting for Kita's arrival in Tianjin before meeting with him to continue discussing the issue of how to handle the puppet troops. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The issue of how to handle the puppet troops under Li Jichun and Zhao Lei in eastern Luan, Beiping, has not been resolved due to their unwillingness to transfer their units. At the ceasefire conference, our representative Xiong Bin telegraphed the Japanese representative Okamura, hoping to resolve this issue within the shortest possible time. Okamura replied by telegram, stating that he would come to Tianjin from Changchun. Xiong is awaiting Okamura's arrival in Tianjin to continue negotiations on how to handle the puppet troops. Once they meet, the issue can be resolved. Xu Yanmou, a counselor of the Military Affairs Committee, previously went to the capital to report on the signing of the ceasefire agreement. Xiong Bin has telegraphed Xu, urging him to return north immediately to participate in the negotiations on resolving the issue of the puppet troops. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Only a Small Number of Japanese and Puppet Troops Moved</h3>
<p>A telegram from Tongzhou, Beiping, states that the Japanese troops east of the city have withdrawn to Liuguantun in Xianghe County. On the 10th, several dozen more people, carrying armored vehicles, returned to Yanjiao Town. At eight o'clock this morning, they withdrew eastward again. Currently, there are no traces of Japanese people within Tong County. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>A telegram from Beiping states that the Japanese troops are building bridges between Qian Gou and Jielingkou. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>A telegram from Tong County, Beiping, states that Japanese troops within Tong County have been successively withdrawing to the territory of Sanhe County. The puppet troops east of the Jian'gan River have also moved towards Yutian. Refugees east of the river are returning one after another, and shops are open as usual. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>A telegram from Lutai, Beiping, states that the puppet troops in Lutai are still in the area of Renzhuangzi Zhang Xuzhuang, about two li east of Lutai. Most of them are near Sandaohao. The puppet troops under Zhao Lei outside Ninghe City have now withdrawn into the city. Zhao is also stationed there and still enters the city from time to time to create disturbances. Several dozen Japanese troops are stationed north of Donggaozhuang to the Banqiao area, constantly scouting towards our Yangzhuangzi area. Our troops are still firmly defending their original positions. The situation on the other side has been quiet recently, but there is no sign of withdrawal. It is said that many of the mid-level officers and above in the puppet army are Japanese. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese troops in Tongzhou, Beiping, are gradually withdrawing. Lutai is peaceful. Zhao Lei's troops in Ninghe City are inactive. Due to the many mountain roads in Miyun, the Japanese troops are finding transportation inconvenient, so their baggage and other supplies will be transported by automobile from Ping to Tianjin, and then transported to the Northeast by the Beining train. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Beining Train Reaches Lutai</h3>
<p>The Beining railway train in Beiping now goes to Lutai. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Wartime Organization of Various Armies Comes to an End</h3>
<p>The wartime organization of various armies in Beiping will end today, and wartime supplies will be stopped starting from the 15th. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Beiping Air Defense Headquarters will end today. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Puppet Troops Disturb Various Places in Eastern Luan</h3>
<p>Due to the disturbances caused by puppet troops in eastern Luan, Tianjin, it has become scorched earth. Only Lutai has our formal troops stationed there, and the ground is still peaceful. The Red Swastika Society is sheltering more than 8,000 refugees there. Due to inconvenient transportation, food is not very plentiful. However, thirty to forty villages west of Lutai, within a radius of forty to fifty li, are also occupied by scattered soldiers and bandits. People are not allowed to flee, and charitable organizations are not allowed to provide relief. The 200,000 residents, men and women, in the area have all become hostages. Countless women have starved to death or committed suicide after being defiled. Several thousand floating corpses are often found in the river. Corpses in wells and trees are also a common sight. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Tianben Unit Withdraws to Jinzhou</h3>
<p>A telegram from Jinzhou received in Tokyo today states that the Japanese army is satisfied with the withdrawal from the Yanqing to Lutai area, in accordance with the conditions of the peace agreement with the Chinese army. Therefore, the Japanese army has begun to withdraw to the Great Wall. The Tianben unit has withdrawn to Jinzhou. The main force of the Japanese army in Tangshan will also be able to withdraw here soon. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>A Special Police Force of 20,000 is Planned</h3>
<p>The Hebei Provincial Government plans to organize 20,000 special police officers to receive lost territories in Tianjin and be solely responsible for suppressing bandits. In the future, the scope of authority of the public security bureaus in each county will also be expanded. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Our National Army</p>
<h3>Must Undergo Thorough Reform</h3>
<p>An Army Officer Discusses Post-War Experiences</p>
<p>A reporter in Beiping interviewed an army officer, who stated that, based on the experiences of the Sino-Japanese War, he deeply knew that if our national army did not undergo thorough reform in the future, it would definitely not be able to cope with international wars. Among the most important things, there were several points. He sincerely hoped that the people of the country could know their own weaknesses and find ways to improve them, and not continue to muddle along, thinking that the ceasefire agreement had been concluded and then forgetting about danger in times of peace. ⑴ In peacetime, attention should be paid to the application of various transportation constructions in wartime. ⑵ The army should emphasize quality over quantity. Although there are many troops in our country, the equipment is incomplete and needs to be improved urgently. ⑶ Officers still lack thorough research on modern warfare technology, and the abilities of lower-level officers and cadres are too poor. ⑷ In addition to increasing light weapons, the army should also strive to replenish heavy weapons, such as tanks and field heavy artillery. ⑸ The peacetime and wartime organization must be equivalent to the enemy country. This time, the strength of one division of our army was only equivalent to one brigade of the Japanese army, and its actual strength was even more different. ⑹ Whether conscription or recruitment is used, the military system must stipulate areas and implement methods such as reserve mobilization. Otherwise, if the army is trained according to the current method, it will be impossible to replenish it once the war is slightly prolonged. ⑺ Airplanes are powerful weapons in modern warfare. The government and the people should rise up and catch up, doing their best to build the air force, and striving to complete the necessary air supremacy within a limited time. ⑻ The key points of our national defense line have now been occupied by the enemy army. Pingjin is no different from the second Shenyang and is likely to be threatened by the enemy at any time. Learning from the past, we should devote all our efforts to the construction and preparation of key points of the inner defense line. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese troops concentrated in Guyuan</p>
<h3>Liu Guitang's Rebellious Troops Receive Japanese Assistance</h3>
<p>Zhao Chengshou telegraphed from Beiping, stating that Liu Guitang's rebellious army is currently near Kangbao, with about 2,000 cavalrymen, and has stopped advancing. Japanese troops in the Duolun area are concentrating in Guyuan, as is the Motegi Cavalry Brigade, and there is a tendency to move towards the Zhanggu Avenue. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>A telegram from Duolun, Beiping, states that after Liu Guitang's bandit army moved south from Duolun, the Japanese Motegi Cavalry Brigade occupied the area. Recently, the Japanese Kwantung Army ordered the 14th Division to depart from Rehe and move towards Duolun, seemingly with the intention of doing something to our Chahar Province. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>A telegram from Beiping states that Liu Guitang's rebel army is still in Kangbao and other places. Yesterday, dozens of heavy-duty trucks loaded with a lot of military fire and more than a dozen tanks arrived from the Japanese side. With this assistance, Liu's troops intend to attack Zhangbei, and the situation there has become tense again. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Chahar Incident</p>
<h3>Can be Resolved Satisfactorily Immediately</h3>
<p>The Name of the Allied Army is Expected to be Abolished</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang Telegraphed Ping to Express His Attitude</p>
<p>The Military Affairs Committee has Sent Three Divisions to Chahar</p>
<h3>A Telegram from Taiyuan States that Feng has Left Zhangjiakou and is Heading North</h3>
<p>Feng Yuxiang issued an eleventh-day telegram from Zhangjiakou, which arrived in Ping this afternoon. The original text was very long, stating three points in general: ⑴ This time it is only for resisting Japan, not against the internal. ⑵ There is no relationship with the Soviet Union. ⑶ He will never carve out a territory for himself. However, regarding the selection of the chairman of Chahar Province, he still insists that Song Zheyuan be reappointed, otherwise, please choose one of Sun Dianying or Fang Zhenwu to succeed him. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Zhangjiakou received by a certain party in Taiyuan, Feng Yuxiang has left Zhangjiakou with more than one hundred officers and guards, divided into many cars, loaded with luggage, and went north along the Zhangku highway. The destination is unknown, but the official office in that area is still strictly keeping it secret. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Regarding the Chahar coup problem in Tianjin, there will be a sharp turn. The Military Affairs Committee has considerable understanding of Feng's difficult situation and decided to transfer three divisions into Chahar to stabilize people's hearts, not intending to target Feng. The Chahar Provincial Government will be reorganized immediately, with Pang Bingxun as the chairman to maintain the status quo. Feng is also advised to go to the capital to serve as the director of training. Feng's representatives, Dai Deyao and others, have been consulting with He Yingqin and Huang Fu in Ping for days, and there are ways to solve the problem. Jia has now come to Tianjin, saying that Feng said that as long as the government has a solution, there is no problem with his own whereabouts, and he can cancel the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Army and issue another telegram, declaring that he will not approach Redification, etc. Huang Fu's representative is still in Chahar, consulting with Feng. Once a decision is made, Pang will go to Chahar to take office. Currently, the three units of Guan Linzheng, Huang Jie, and Xiao Zhichu have been deployed to the PingSui Railway. Fu Zuoyi's unit has arrived in Kangzhuang. As for the puppet troops Liu Guitang, Zhang Haipeng, and Tang Yulin, they are now in the territory of Chahar, causing great disturbances, and plainclothes teams are also active everywhere, but there has been no contact yet. Although the Japanese army has stated that if the Chahar affair can be resolved, there is no intention of entering Chahar, it is still difficult to speculate on their true intentions at this time. Looking at their recent troop movements, it is difficult to be optimistic about the future. However, with the mediation of the authorities, internal problems have made progress, and unfortunately, the situation may be avoided. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>The military and political leaders in Beiping decided on specific conditions after discussing the Chahar situation tonight. A representative will be sent to Zhangjiakou to visit Feng within the next day. Sun Dianying stated that he would not take the position of the Northwest Reclamation Superintendent. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Feng Sends Liu Zhizhou to Taiyuan</h3>
<p>After Feng Yuxiang issued a telegram, he sent Liu Zhizhou to Bing to meet Yan and return to Zhang. He came to Ping today and visited Song Zheyuan for a meeting. He will go to Tianjin tonight. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Chahar affair in Beiping has a way to resolve it due to the results of persuasion from all parties to Feng Yuxiang. It is heard that Feng's attitude is also willing to stop at the right time. His newly compiled troops will be reorganized separately into the Central Army in the future. The name of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army will be canceled invisibly. Feng himself may be given a border defense title by the Central Government and will temporarily reside in Zhangjiakou. The three divisions of Fu Zuoyi, Pang Bingxun, and Feng Qinzai, which were dispatched by the Central Government to Chahar, are all marching on foot due to the lack of vehicles on the PingSui Railway. Fu Pang opened near Zhangjiakou, and Feng's part was stationed along the PingSui line to prevent bandit troops. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhangjiakou Citizens Form a Vigilance Team</h3>
<p>A person from Zhangjiakou, Beiping, talked about the fact that Feng ordered the citizens in Zhangjiakou to organize vigilance teams in districts. Each household in Zhangjiakou must send one person to compile and train the broadsword team. Inspections are still carried out in the city, especially strict on prostitutes and entertainment venues. Railway workers also formed vigilance teams. (12th Dispatch</p>
<h3>Bao Feng in a Stalemate Southwest of Xuanhua</h3>
<p>Bao Gang and Feng Zhanhai's troops are still in a stalemate about sixty li southwest of Xuanhua. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>He Huang Invites Qin Dechun for a Conversation</h3>
<p>Huang sent a representative to Zhangjiakou with Song's representative to visit Feng in Beiping. Feng expressed his sincerity. The representative returned to Ping this morning. In the afternoon, He and Huang invited Qin Dechun to Jurentang for a conversation and continued to discuss solutions. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>A Certain Country Makes an Unofficial Statement</h3>
<p>A certain country in Beiping made an unofficial statement, stating that if it does not stop resisting Japan, it will advance towards Zhangjiakou and the PingSui Line in Chahar Province. The authorities are discussing Feng's title. Pang's department concentrates on the defense area left behind by Kangzhuang, which will be taken over by the two departments of Xiao Zhichu and Liu Duoquan. He and Huang will hold a meeting of military and political leaders tonight to discuss the Chahar situation. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang is Willing to End Automatically</h3>
<p>The Chahar situation in Tianjin has a clue to reconciliation and can be determined within the next day. The representative of Huang and He stationed in Zhangjiakou has telegraphed to report that the contact is smooth. Feng is willing to end it automatically and has telegraphed on the 11th to declare that he only advocated resisting Japan and was not becoming red, and the Kucha Highway was not open, so there was no transportation of goods. As for entrusting Tong Linge with the leadership of Chahar, it was to entrust the responsible person, not to control the territory or seize the government. Fang Zhenwu and Sun Dianying are pillars of the country and should be treated fairly and well, and Yuxiang will never carve out a territory for himself, etc. Song requested He to give Feng the title of Border Defense Overseer, which He is considering. However, the Central Government hopes that Feng will go to the capital and return to the position of Director of Training. It is not yet known whether Feng is willing to go. The authorities are now paying special attention to the serious situation in Chahar and have sent three divisions of Xiao Zhichu, Feng Qinzai, and Liu Duoquan to Chahar to maintain public order. Fu and Pang's troops are also moving towards Chahar. Pang's appointment as Chairman of Chahar seems to have been decided, and Fu will also be appointed as Director of Appeasement in Zhangjiakou. The two units of Feng Zhanhai and Bao Gang are still confronting each other in Yuxian County. Liu Guitang has sent personnel to Zhangjiakou to contact Feng Yuxiang to negotiate surrender. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wu Yong Talks About the Recent Situation in Chahar Province</h3>
<p>Wu Yong of Beiping said that last month, after Feng sent a telegram taking office and appointing Tong Linge as the acting chairman of Chahar Province, the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs were taken over. After Zhang Jiuqing, the director of the Public Security Bureau, handed over, he was monitored by someone sent by Ji Hongchang, the new director, and then it was eased. Feng also gave Zhang the title of provincial committee member. Other departments were also taken over by people appointed by Feng. Linge concurrently served as the head of the Department of Civil Affairs, Zhang Yunrong was appointed to take charge of the Department of Finance, and the two departments of construction and education were changed to offices, with Qiao Qibing as the director of the construction office and Hu Ziheng as the director of the education office. However, the economy was tight. Feng previously raised 30,000 yuan from merchants in Zhangbei and sent it to the General Headquarters. The next day, the county government raised another 15,000 yuan. Many of the army division commanders appointed by Feng had no troops. After being appointed, they went to various places to recruit. Fang and Feng were in the position of the Allied Army, not absolutely attached to Feng. Song recently sent a personal letter to Feng, advising him to remove the title of Commander-in-Chief and act in unison with the Central Government. It is heard that Feng seems to have realized recently, and I think there will be dawn soon. The original police militias in Kangbao and other places were swept away and transferred by Feng to form the Self-Defense Army. Liu Guitang's department has two to three thousand people, and Cui Xingwu has more than two thousand people, totaling less than five thousand people. They are burning, killing, and looting everywhere and are purely bandits. Tang's department has recently returned to Guyuan. Because some of the soldiers have been moved, Sun Dianying has only two or three brigades left. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<p>According to a report from the front from a certain organization stationed in Rehe in Beiping, the Japanese are now adopting two policies towards Rehe: they are doing their best to implement small favors to the Han people to win over people's hearts, and they are doing their best to implement incitement to the Mongols in order to create resentment with the Han people and induce them to form another "Inner Mongolia Dayuan Republic." It is heard that the Japanese army is currently publicizing in various counties of Rehe Province, totaling less than several hundred people. In terms of taxes, only the opium tax is levied separately, at a rate of up to five yuan per mu. In terms of transportation, the railway from Beipiao to west of Chaoyang has been completely opened to traffic and is now being extended towards Chifeng and Tongliao to build a railway and connect rails. Countless highways have been built in each county. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Preventing Floods</h3>
<p>Yun</p>
<p>According to recent news, the Yangtze River water level has suddenly surged again. The capital Xiaguan has risen sharply by two and a half feet on the 10th. Wuhan has reached 40 feet, exceeding the water level during the great flood of twenty years ago. The area of Edong Chun has broken through 48 dikes, and more than 100,000 mu of farmland have been flooded. The disaster has already formed. I am panicked, but the counties have telegraphed the Hubei Provincial Government to allocate funds to help the emergency rescue project. The Hubei Provincial Government and the National Economic Committee and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau have not yet heard of a plan. I think of the tragic situation of the national flood twenty years ago, and I am frightened by the future dangers.</p>
<p>The total number of people affected by the national flood twenty years ago was about 25.2 million, which is equal to the total number of farmers in the United States. The area of affected arable land was about 87 million mu, accounting for about 56% of the total area of arable land in the country. The total amount of losses reached 200,000 million yuan, and the direct losses of damaged dikes and roads and other indirect losses are even inestimable. If I close my eyes and think quietly, the tragic scene of the land subsidence two years ago is vividly presented in front of me. The facts show that the disaster-stricken land has not been restored to this day, and many orphans and widows have been displaced. After this disaster, the national vitality was exhausted. How can this kind of tragic and inhumane disaster be repeated? The past is not far away, and our authorities should make preparations for the prevention of water dikes along the river.</p>
<p>Even more so, in today's civilized countries, most of them can prevent all disasters with human power, but in our country, there is no year without disasters for more than 20 years. Water, drought, locust, and hail disasters are all available. We don't know how to prevent them beforehand, and we can't remedy them afterwards. The whole country is in the persecution of disasters. This kind of phenomenon is seen in the civilized world of the 20th century, which cannot be said to be a great shame for the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>I believe that it is now imperative to urgently rescue the impending disaster in the Yangtze River Basin and actively prevent it from expanding. The National Government should strictly order the relevant authorities to step up the work of dikes and make preparations for the rainy day with great attention, so as to avoid seeing the disaster of two years ago today. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. Our authorities should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Japan's Future Policies</p>
<h3>Consolidating Asian and African Diplomatic Power</h3>
<p>Adding Embassies and Consulates, Especially Focusing on China and India</p>
<p>The Military Budget is Increased, and the Ambition of Militarism is Not Checked</p>
<p>The Tokyo Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now adopted the following policies for the budget of the next fiscal year: ⑴ Because Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it must consolidate Japan's economic and diplomatic power. ⑵ Reduce the number of embassies and consulates in Europe, and add embassies or consulates in Egypt, South Africa, the Near East, India, the South Seas, "Manchukuo," China, and Africa. ⑶ Pay special attention to the economic relations between Japan and India, and establish consulates in Karachi and Madras, and select one of the ambassadors as the consul general in Calcutta, so as to have equal power to discuss everything with the Governor-General of India. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>The two directors of the Tokyo Ministry of Foreign Affairs relied on the military's loudspeaker and suppressed the great ambassadors stationed abroad by taking advantage of the military's power, so they were attacked by the great ambassadors. Shiratori, the director of the Information Department, has been transferred to the Swedish ambassador, and Tani, the director of the Asian Affairs Department, still has no destination. It is heard that the army has recommended Tani Masayuki to be the councilor of the Japanese Embassy in Manchukuo, to be the supreme emperor of the pseudo-Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The official decision will be made within the next day. The successor to the director will recommend Yano, the counselor of the Japanese Embassy in China. Yano is the son-in-law of Ishii Kikujiro (the current Japanese representative to the World Economic Conference), a senior diplomat in Japan, and a brother of the previous Director of Information Shiratori Toshio.

<p>When the Japanese Navy compiled its next fiscal year's budget, it had a so-called second naval replenishment plan. This matter is now attracting much attention. According to this plan, Japan will use 370,000,000 yuan to build more than 20 warships around 1936, including one 8,000-ton aircraft carrier, two 8,500-ton six-inch-diameter gun cruisers, seven 1,400-ton destroyers, one 5,000-ton mine-laying ship, twelve submarines of various tonnages, and several minesweepers. The naval authorities will formally discuss their budget plan after the government decides its attitude towards this matter. It is heard that the next naval budget is about 400,000,000 yuan (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Although the Japanese next army budget has not been submitted for consideration, its total amount is between 440,000,000 and 450,000,000 yuan. Generally speaking, the Japanese army expenses will be larger than before, because in addition to the current expenses of 200,000,000 yuan and the Manchurian military expenses of 140,000,000 to 150,000,000 yuan, it is also necessary to raise 100,000,000 yuan for the expenses of supplementing military equipment. Everyone expects that if there are no unexpected events, the Manchurian military expenses are expected to be reduced, because it is heard that the so-called bandit suppression work has now been almost completely completed.

All Germans should stand on a battle line in the near future to support the colonial movement. Germany wants to recover its old colonies as part of Germany's demand for equal status. He hopes that the Hitler government will not only seek military equality but also seek colonial equality. (11th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>London Times</p>
<h3>On Sino-American New Loans</h3>
<p>The London Times reported that the United States is rumored to have provided China with loans to purchase American cotton and wheat. The result will increase the uneasiness of British holders of Chinese bonds, because if Chinese national taxes are used to pay off the new debts, while the old debts of the British are continuously ignored, the British will inevitably consider this unfavorable to them. The close and organized actions taken by the holders of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway bonds are noteworthy. It is especially important that this was initiated by a large group of local investors in the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, because local creditors have legal access to the administration of the railway that secures their bonds, while creditors outside of China obviously have no such access. Therefore, their accusations of waste have considerable weight. (12th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Opening of the World Economic Conference</h3>
<p>Gathering the Talents of Sixty-Six Nations in One Hall</p>
<p>The Greatest Gathering Since the Paris Peace Conference</p>
<p>The British Monarch Delivers a Welcome Speech</p>
<h3>Hoping to Heal the Economic Sickness Through Collective Efforts</h3>
<p>Prime Minister MacDonald Delivers the Opening Address</p>
<h3>Strongly Emphasizing the Need for International Cooperation to Avert the Crisis</h3>
<p>Sixteen National Representatives Elected to Form the Steering Committee</p>
<p>General Debate to Begin at Ten O'Clock This Morning</p>
<p>London: This afternoon, the British monarch held the opening ceremony of the World Economic Conference at the Royal Geological Museum in South Kensington, with the aim of healing economic ills. The British monarch addressed the representatives of various countries from the golden throne on the conference podium, stating, "At this time of economic hardship sweeping the world, I welcome you to this country with a deep sense of responsibility. As the head of state hosting the opening meeting of an international conference, I believe this is an unprecedented event in history. I wish to express my satisfaction that this conference could be held, and I deeply believe that this joint effort can produce beneficial results. I welcome the representatives of the member states of the League of Nations. I have always followed the work of the League of Nations with keen admiration and attention. The League of Nations convened this conference and prepared everything with the valuable services of expert committees. Without the League of Nations, without the ideals of the League of Nations, I cannot but doubt whether this conference could be held. I also warmly welcome the representatives of non-League of Nations member states. I acknowledge their willingness to join in a spirit of beneficial cooperation in joint discussions. Finally, I would like to extend a special welcome to the representatives of the British Dominions and India." At this point, the British monarch switched to French and continued, "As I look around at this solemn gathering, my heart is moved very deeply. This gathering may seem great, but what it represents is an infinitely greater concept of hope and aspirations for the entire world. The world is now in a precarious state, and your responsibilities are extremely heavy. Unless you proceed with goodwill and sincere cooperation, it will be difficult to achieve success. I extend my hand to you and sincerely wish that your efforts will produce the pleasant results that the world urgently awaits." At this point, the British monarch switched back to English and said, "I fully acknowledge the difficulty of the conference's work, but the genuine desire to reach an agreement is firmly and demonstrably present. This gives me great hope. All countries in the world share the same ailments. This is evident from the increase in the number of unemployed people. In terms of human suffering, I have often cited these figures as a cause for concern in recent years, and they are also a cause for concern for everyone gathered here today who bears the heavy responsibility of government. In this universally recognized crisis, I urge you to cooperate to seek the ultimate happiness of the world, utilizing the great power of the world to safeguard the material progress of civilization. This is certainly not beyond human reach. The world's power has not diminished, but inventions and organizations are emerging one after another, increasing possibilities to the extent that abundant production has created new and difficult problems. Accompanying this astonishing material progress is a new recognition of the value of countries supporting and cooperating with each other. Today is truly an opportunity to contribute a new conscience of shared interests to serve humanity. I now declare this conference open with the firm belief that mutual consultation is the first step towards righteous action. I will follow the discussions of this conference with the utmost interest and attention. I earnestly pray that the efforts of your work will restore the world to a path of prosperity and orderly progress." (12th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London: After the British monarch left the conference hall, Chairman MacDonald immediately delivered the opening address, stating that all countries are suffering from a common ailment, as can be clearly seen from the daily increase in the number of unemployed people. Since 1929, prices have fallen far below the cost of production and have fluctuated erratically, disrupting the normal relationships of all economic activities. Coupled with the restrictions on trade, the widespread crisis has increased. Tariffs and exchange controls have reduced international trade by half in one or two years. The large number of countries abandoning the gold standard is unprecedented in peacetime since the establishment of an international medium of exchange. MacDonald then discussed war debts, solemnly stating that before the obstacles to economic recovery are removed, we must resolve the war debts, complete the work of the Lausanne Conference, and solve this troublesome problem once and for all in light of the current state of the world. He then strongly emphasized that the World Economic Conference is the result of the Lausanne Conference. He recalled that after the Lausanne Conference completed its urgent work, it declared that in order to clear the world crisis, a conference with a wider scope should be held. At that time, this intention was recorded. He further elaborated on the necessity of international cooperation between countries, saying that no country can permanently benefit itself by sacrificing others, and that mutual benefit is a necessary condition for seeking individual benefits. (12th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>London: After MacDonald delivered the opening address and the report of the Credentials Committee was approved at the World Economic Conference, China, Argentina, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the United States, Russia, and Canada were elected to the Steering Committee. MacDonald announced that the general debate would begin at 10:30 tomorrow morning and adjourned the meeting at 4:39 p.m. The Steering Committee then immediately convened a closed meeting (12th, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Clearly Audible in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The wireless broadcast of the speech delivered by the British monarch at the opening of the World Economic Conference was received here in Tokyo tonight and was very clear. However, the speech by British Prime Minister MacDonald was largely unintelligible. (12th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Yan and Koo Arrive Early</h3>
<p>London: This afternoon, Dr. Yan Huiquing and Dr. Koo Vi Kyuin arrived at the opening ceremony of the World Economic Conference quite early, so they sat in the front row facing the British monarch's podium. The staff who handled the historical translation work for the Sino-Japanese disputes in the past were all present today, making the gathering feel even more like a conference in Geneva. (12th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Students Make Strange Noises</h3>
<p>London: The British monarch departed from Windsor Palace at 2:07 p.m. today, traveled by car to London, and arrived at the venue at 2:50 p.m. There were no demonstrations encountered along the way, but just two minutes after arriving at the venue, a group of students from the Royal College of Science, located across the street from the venue, made catcalls (expressing ridicule, commonly seen in theaters) repeatedly. The police quickly intervened, and the noise subsided. The police called these students' strange actions "the boiling of youthful spirits." Unexpectedly, just two minutes after the British monarch took the stage to speak, there was renewed clamor from the demonstrators, and the sound of machine guns rang out from the thoroughfare, continuing until the end of the monarch's speech. This is a strange phenomenon rarely seen in Britain. (12th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>London: The World Economic Conference, which is of great historical value, has been fully prepared and will open at 3:00 p.m. today. The representatives of sixty-six countries have all arrived in England.</p>
<p>A Gathering of Talents: Among them are one head of state (the President of Switzerland, M. Etter), eight prime ministers or premiers, twenty foreign ministers, and forty-seven other cabinet members. It can truly be called the largest gathering of politicians and economists since the Versailles Peace Conference.</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement: The venue is the Royal Geological Museum in South Kensington, London. It is magnificent and unparalleled. The seating in the venue was not completed until a few hours before the opening. In front of the splendid podium are the seats for the representatives of the sixty-six countries, with seats for advisors, the diplomatic corps, journalists, and special guests arranged on three sides. Seats for ordinary listeners and guests are on both sides and at the rear of the conference hall.</p>
<p>Representative Seating: There are fourteen rows of representative seats. Those with more representatives generally sit in the front rows. England and France each have eight representatives, so they sit in the front row. The United States, Germany, Italy, and Japan each have six representatives, sitting in the second row. China has three representatives, sitting in the third row. Although Soviet Russia has only two representatives, several seats are specially reserved for advisors to sit with them, because Soviet Russia has a special relationship in the world economy. There are 152 seats for the diplomatic corps, 144 seats for economic experts and advisors, and 45 seats for special guests, all specially invited guests to the opening ceremony. Three hundred journalists representing participating countries also occupy a corner close to the podium.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Opening: After 2:30 p.m. today, the representatives entered the venue in succession. The sound of welcome from the audience was like thunder. The opening was announced at 3:00 p.m. The British monarch personally delivered a</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>(8)</p>
<p>welcome speech, which was then broadcast worldwide via radio. This was followed by the opening address by British Prime Minister MacDonald. Because today's meeting was an opening ceremony, only organizational matters were considered.</p>
<p>Conference Procedure: Formal business will begin on Tuesday, when the chief representatives of each country will present their economic recovery plans in turn. According to Chairman MacDonald's intention, each person's speech is limited to ten minutes. After that, group committee meetings will be held. After some committees reach important agreements, a plenary session will be held. As for the agenda, there has been little discussion in the past two days. Most of the representatives are engaged in formal visits with each other. (12th, National News Agency)</p>

<p>Moscow: Today, Moscow newspapers predict that there will be an attempt to consolidate an anti-Russian bloc under British leadership at the World Economic Conference. The Communist Party organ Izvestia advises the world to consider whether it would be more beneficial to enjoy peaceful trade relations and normal credit with Soviet Russia than to attempt to rejuvenate itself with the blood of Soviet Russia.

<h3>Japan's Challenging Attitude</h3>
<p>Focusing on Eliminating Boycotts</p>
<p>Avoiding Discussion of the Sino-Japanese Case</p>
<p>Tokyo: Before the opening of the World Economic Conference, Britain showed an undisguised challenging attitude towards the Japanese economy. Therefore, Japan's established policy for the Economic Conference has also become a belligerent attitude. Foreign Minister Uchida issued the following instructions to Representative Ishii: The Japanese government's attitude towards the Economic Conference is to cooperate with various countries in principle, but if there is anything that endangers Japan's existence, it will resolutely reject it. For example, regarding China's anti-Japanese boycott movement, Japan does not seek international assistance and handles it independently. Therefore, at the World Economic Conference, the Japanese representative will not make any demands regarding the Chinese anti-Japanese problem. Also, if a certain country participating in the conference oppresses the Japanese economy, Japan will also adopt an active policy to start an economic dispute with it. (11th, Japan United Electric)</p>
<p>Tokyo: It is now known that the Japanese government has not issued new instructions to the Japanese delegation attending the World Economic Conference, because they had already received detailed instructions when the delegation left Tokyo. It is heard that the Japanese delegation will advocate free trade and the elimination of obstacles to free trade among nations in order to relieve the current global commercial oppression. As for the issue of economic boycotts, the Japanese representative will transfer the matter to Chief Representative Ishii for handling according to the situation. It is now heard that if other countries agree to conclude a general tariff agreement, Japan will also join, but Japanese officials say that Japan has not increased taxes for ten years, so the tax rate is lower. (11th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London: The Japanese delegation held its first delegation meeting at 5:00 a.m. on the 11th to discuss countermeasures for the Economic Conference. Plenipotentiary Ishii, along with Deputy Representatives Matsudaira and Fukai and other key members, attended. First, the content of Representative Ishii's speech at the conference on the 14th was decided. As a result of exchanging opinions on the method of selecting members of the Economic Conference Steering Committee, if the chairman appoints the committee members, Representative Ishii of Japan will naturally be a member, and it is even possible that he may obtain the position of vice-chairman. As for the general committee, the currency committee, and the economic committee and other subcommittees, Japan will decide on representatives after they are established. According to the current situation, Japan intends not to propose the Sino-Japanese issue, but if it is proposed, it is determined to resist resolutely. (11th, Japan United Electric)</p>
<h3>Japanese Goods Dumped Abroad</h3>
<p>Causing Sleepless Nights for Various Countries</p>
<p>Berlin: The Kolonia Newspaper published an article on the London Conference, saying, "The London Conference wants to stabilize currencies and give them a sound basis, but it may encounter an obstacle, that is, Japan is competing with people in the world market with its currency inflation policy." The newspaper said that Japan's competition is causing sleepless nights for export merchants in various countries. It said, "Japan is militaristic and forgets its reasons. It wants to use currency inflation policy as a financial talisman, and does not have time to think about the irremediable consequences in the future. The United States does not want to recognize the position Japan has obtained in China through aggressive means, so it is absolutely impossible to make political concessions to Japan. So, is it possible to find a way economically to avoid resistance from Japan? But it is not necessarily possible, because the principle of most-favored-nation treatment has become shaky since the Ottawa Agreement was established." (11th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Two Major Difficulties at Present</h3>
<p>Currency and War Debts</p>
<p>Paris Times Commentary on the World Economic Conference: Before the opening of the conference, we feel that there are two issues that greatly affect the progress of the conference's work. One is the currency issue, which cannot be sincerely resolved without restoring the gold standard. But as of now, the US dollar and the British pound have shown no signs of stability. The currency issue can never be resolved by forcibly redistributing gold by human power. If this kind of perfunctory method is adopted, the currencies of various countries will be generally devalued. Trying this kind of method in the current state of world economic chaos is inevitably dangerous. All countries in the world that do not want to live in a state of spiritual and financial chaos resolutely oppose this perfunctory policy. In addition to currency, the second important issue is the resolution of war debts. (11th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Three-Nation Financial Conference</h3>
<p>Opinions on Stabilizing Currency Prices Tend to Converge</p>
<p>Paris: Paris newspapers today published news of the British, American, and French financial officials' meeting held in London yesterday in great detail. According to reports, the discussion centered on currency consolidation and other currency issues. However, the Petit Parisien newspaper claimed that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss a number of outstanding issues and to reach a solution before the opening of the World Economic Conference so that they could be jointly presented at the World Economic Conference. These three countries now control 70% of the world's total amount of money, so it is imperative to exchange opinions beforehand. Other newspapers, such as Le Matin, claimed that regarding the stabilization of the monetary system, an agreement has been approached by this meeting, but the complete agreement itself has not yet arrived.

<h3>War Debt Repayment Issue</h3>
<p>White House Studies Whether It Is Legal</p>
<p>US Congress to Adjourn Today or Tomorrow</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt's staff is now studying whether partial repayment of war debts is legal, and whether accepting such repayment would constitute a clear recognition that the remaining debts can be unpaid. It is heard that Britain has already made an informal proposal to the US government through its ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, to repay part of the war debt due on June 15. The Baltimore Sun editorial said that partial repayment would create political disputes, as the move would be based on the Lausanne Convention. (11th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington: Congressional Democratic leaders met with President Roosevelt today and stated to the President that Congress could adjourn tonight or tomorrow. The President's decision on the June debt, such as approving partial repayment, will be welcomed by those who oppose the cancellation of war debts. (12th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Crowds at the Station</h3>
<p>Representatives of France, Italy, and Other Countries Arrive Last</p>
<p>London: The people who went to the station to see the demeanor of the representatives of various countries at the Economic Conference were extremely crowded. Those who had no duties and went to the station purely out of curiosity were blocked by the police and stood in the back row. Those coming and going on the platform were all administrative staff and railway officials. Because of the large number of diplomatic personnel from various countries coming to London, the railway authorities specially doubled the number of carriages on the train from the port to London at 7:00 p.m. (11th, Havas Agency)</p>
<p>London: Representatives from various countries arrived here today in an endless stream. The last batch was the representatives from six countries: France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Portugal, and Yugoslavia. They arrived here at night. The British embassies of the six countries all sent personnel to Victoria Station to greet them. Among the French delegation was French Prime Minister Daladier, and among the Czech delegation was Foreign Minister Dr. Beneš. Dr. Beneš has a prominent reputation in League of Nations affairs. (11th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Some Diplomat</p>
<h3>Impressions of the Conference</h3>
<p>Beijing: According to a diplomat, the sole purpose of this World Economic Conference is to solve the world economic problem, but because the inside story is too complicated, the result is still difficult to determine at present. However, judging from the various conferences in the past, it is expected that the outcome of this conference will be difficult to be optimistic about. Our country's participation in this conference is not holding great hope, but is regarded as a ray of light for resolving disputes. Whether or not a good result can be obtained in the future depends entirely on whether the great powers have sincerity. It is heard that if this conference proceeds smoothly, in addition to discussing the six major items stipulated, other issues may also be discussed. In short, I hope that the people of the country will not have too high hopes for this conference, and even if there is a good resolution, it may not be implemented. The resolutions of the League of Nations in the past can serve as a clear lesson. In this serious situation, we must rely on our own efforts to escape the oppression of force.

<p>Central Government Plans to Raise 20 Million Yuan</p>
<h3>To Relieve the North China War Zone</h3>
<p>The Government and the Banking Sector Will Each Raise 10 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Loan to Farmers in the Same Way as the International Famine Relief Commission Last Year</p>
<p>Nanjing: A certain central committee member said that the central government's method of relieving the North China war zone will refer to the method undertaken by the China International Famine Relief Commission last year in Jiangxi and Anhui provinces. It will start from the counties along the Great Wall and gradually move inward. The relief funds are planned to be raised by the government and the banking sector, each raising 10 million yuan, and will be loaned to farmers in combination. For every two yuan borrowed, one yuan will be repaid. Interest will be calculated at an annual rate of four percent on the amount borrowed. This fund is being planned by the government. At the same time, another 1 million yuan will be raised specifically for office use. In the future, special commissioners will be sent to take charge, and a committee of an advisory nature will be established to assist. The goal is to complete it within one year. In order to maintain the discipline of the troops stationed in the war zone, the government will pay attention to the supplies for the troops, and will also form a special gendarmerie to maintain order. This type of gendarmerie will be under the command of the special commissioner, and the work area will be limited to the counties north of the Beining Line, east of Tanggu and Peiping, east and north of the Peisui Line's Peiping and Kalgan, south of the Great Wall, Shanhaiguan, and Kalgan, and north of the coast, Shanhaiguan, and Dagu.

<h3>Two Memorial Week Reports</h3>

<p>Nanjing: The Central Committee held its 82nd Memorial Week at 8:00 a.m. on the 12th, attended by Ye Chucang, Wang Qi, Li Ciwen, Xiao Zhongzhen, Chen Guofu, Zheng Zhannan, Li Jingzhai, Hong Ludong,</p>
<p>Chen Lifu, Ju Zheng, etc. Ye Chucang chaired the meeting, and Chen Guofu reported on "The Importance of Improving Traditional Chinese Medicine," stating that Chinese medicine has a history of about several thousand years, but because it does not know how to improve, there is no progress, which has led to the promotion of Western medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine is not valued. Germany and Japan have the most developed medicine, but they still take the advantages of our Chinese medicine. We should not discriminate against it. Moreover, people in the mainland still rely on Chinese medicine when they are sick because it is widespread and the cost is small, and because Chinese medicine is suitable for the constitution of Chinese people. Therefore, improving and promoting Chinese medicine is essential. The way to improve is to explain or apply the principles of Chinese medicine using scientific methods, and to establish Chinese medicine schools to improve the talents of Chinese medicine practitioners. Domestic scientists should also help the development of Chinese medicine, improve its diagnostic methods and chemical refining of the components of Chinese medicine, and preserve its inherent strengths, so as to seek happiness for the majority of people in the mainland. I hope everyone will pay attention to and promote it. The meeting adjourned at 9:00 a.m. (12th, Central News Agency)</p>

Chairman Lin led the ceremony, followed by Shao Yuanchong's report entitled "National Survival and National Revival," based on the Premier's doctrine of nationalism. He described the foundation of national survival and the path to national revival, hoping that the people of the country would do their best in their spirit and time, follow the Premier's doctrine, seek national survival, and achieve national revival.

<p>Unemployed Overseas Chinese in Nagasaki</p>
<h3>Measures for Returning to China Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Nanjing consulted on measures to transport unemployed overseas Chinese in Nagasaki back to China. The result was that there were only 270 unemployed overseas Chinese in that area, including 184 from Fujian and only 3 from Shandong. Since the number was not large, it was inconvenient to send a special ship to pick them up. They should still take ordinary ships back to China. After arriving in China, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Ministry of Railways would reduce or waive ship and train fares to return them to their hometowns. The necessary expenses will be jointly submitted to the Executive Yuan to request the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Feng Yuxiang in the Northwest Corner</h3>
<p>National Security</p>
<h3>Starting from the Beginning</h3>
<p>Since General Christ was forced to retreat on the Longhai Line in the 19th year of the Republic of China, he has been depressed. He has been lurking in half the sky in the Northwest, reading and writing. After the September 18th Incident, General Christ began to shout the slogan of "Resistance" just like everyone else. Although the voice was gentle and pleasant, General Christ still did not run to the front line. But this time it has changed. General Christ, who was squatting in the library in Tu'ergou, Zhangjiakou, could no longer bear the sound of the Luan East artillery fire. General Christ stood on the top of Tu'ergou, Zhangjiakou, and shouted, and actually implemented the anti-Japanese war. So, the war clouds in the northwest corner gradually appeared tense in the newspapers. Anyway, people who don't live in the northwest corner, who can know what is going on? However, the newspaper said, "The Japanese and puppet troops occupied Guyuan and approached Zhangjiakou. Fang Zhenwu fought a great battle with the rebel army in Dushikou..." What is this if it is not true resistance to Japan?</p>
<p>I lived in "Zhangjiakou," the provincial capital of Chahar Province, for more than a month, and also had a face-to-face meeting with General Christ. At the same time, on the day when General Christ automatically took over the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the library in Tu'ergou, Zhangjiakou, (May 26) I was still living in the Huayuan Hotel in Zhangjiakou, and I was fortunate enough to attend such a great ceremony of anti-Japanese war. Even the heavens seemed to be helping General Christ, and at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, there was a heavy rain. I read the great announcement of the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the rain, and fled Zhangjiakou in the northwest corner in a mess on the 27th. Now, General Christ has truly contacted the Japanese and puppet troops. According to recent reports, the main battle between the two armies is about to begin. So, how can I not report to the readers in detail everything about General Christ's actions in Zhangjiakou? Finally, I must declare that this record is completely faithful and does not contain any emotionality. Besides, I used to be a small soldier, and I also have considerable admiration for General Christ.</p>
<h3>㈠ Christ General in Tu'er Gou</h3>
<p>Tu'er Gou is located south of Zhangjiakou Railway Station, and the library is situated in Tu'er Gou. It is said that before Christ General resided in the library, ordinary people could still enter to read books. However, since Christ General moved in, the security has become strict. To reach the library from the city, one must cross the railway, turn halfway to the right, make two forty-five-degree angle turns, and endure some sandy dust. When approaching the library by about three hundred meters in a quiet alley, one can see Christ General's guards. There are multiple sentry posts on the corners of the walls. Each guard holds a bright broadsword in his right hand and a wooden-handled hand grenade on his belt. Outside the library's earthen gate, there are also two guards, armed with broadswords and Mauser pistols. The faces of the guards are all dark and shiny. Here, we acknowledge that Christ General is a good example of how to train soldiers. One often sees Christ General's guards carrying large black coal chunks on their shoulders. At the same time, the air is always filled with the majestic and mournful tunes of military songs in the mornings and evenings.</p>
<p>It is said that since Christ General moved into the library, he has been constantly reading books. Unable to understand them himself, he has hired several teachers to instruct him from time to time. Christ General is confident in his ability to handle guns, having gained considerable expertise. Thus, he has started studying politics anew, including the Three Principles of the People. It goes without saying that Christ General is very familiar with Soviet communism, as well as fascism, which he has studied deeply. Therefore, his ultimate goal is to resist Japan. Although Duolun fell and Chahar East was in danger, Christ General did not express anything concrete. But this shot was fired correctly. At least the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces can be worn. The library in Tu'er Gou has transformed into the headquarters of the Allied Forces. At this time, Zhangjiakou in the northwest corner has become Christ General's base for resisting Japan.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Christ General suffered from a sore throat. It just so happened that at that time, I took a rickshaw to visit him at the library in Tu'er Gou. After passing the gatekeeper's inspection, I presented a card and asked the dispatch office to forward it. Little did I know that they seemed surprised when they saw my card. A burly soldier next to me said to himself, "Ah! From Shanghai. Such a long way. Must be a Southerner." I pretended not to hear. The soldier wearing a blue Zhongshan suit who was delivering my message asked very casually as he turned back, "Sir, where are you from?" "Ah…," I paused slightly before saying, "I am from Henan." As a result, the gray-clad figures around me looked at me with even more surprise, muttering, "Ah, a Henan person."</p>
<p>I stood next to the guardhouse in front of the library for five minutes. The messenger in the blue Zhongshan suit came out from the second gate. I quickly greeted him, and he said very politely, "Sir, I am truly sorry. Mr. Feng's sore throat has not yet healed. I am truly sorry to have disappointed you. If you have anything, you can discuss it with Mr. Feng in writing." Hearing this, I still could not meet Mr. Feng. At the same time, I was asked to discuss things in writing, which was quite novel. After a long pause, I said to him in a sincere tone, "I am sorry to bother you. Please tell Mr. Feng again that I have come a long way from Shanghai. Furthermore, the people of the country are very concerned about Mr. Feng's current situation. We journalists are like representatives of those who are eager to know Mr. Feng's condition. Therefore, it is always better to have a few words in person. It is impossible for a journalist to visit an important person and only communicate in writing." The young soldier listened to my sharp but conciliatory words. He turned around and went back in for a long time. This time, it was still not successful, but the meaning had become somewhat flexible. "Sir, Mr. Feng, following the doctor's orders, really cannot meet with you. Please leave your address. This afternoon, around six or seven o'clock, Mr. Feng may send a representative to talk to you, and Mr. Feng will be responsible for what the representative says." Hearing the final answer, I knew that further entanglement would be useless. I gave them a polite bow with my hat off. They all widened their eyes and gave me a solemn and orderly salute. I got back into the rickshaw in the wind, sand, and dust, thinking to myself, "Ah, Mr. Feng's sore throat is probably because he shouted anti-Japanese slogans too enthusiastically."</p>
<p>After returning from the Tu'er Gou Library, I waited obediently for our Christ General's representative at the Huayuan Hotel. Right at six fifteen, the representative I was waiting for was led in by the waiter. This representative was very burly, wearing a small white American sailor-style hat, and had a very hearty demeanor. As soon as he entered, he said in a Luandong accent, "Are you Mr. Wan?" "Yes." "What is your surname?" I asked. "My surname is Zhang." At this time, he was already sitting in a chair by the window. I gave him a Fortress cigarette, and he lit it himself. I intended to exchange business cards with him, but he said politely, "I am sorry, sir, I do not have a business card with me. Let me write it for you." So he wrote three characters on my business card, "Zhang Jiurong." Immediately afterward, he said very seriously, "Today, Mr. Feng's throat is not well, so he asked me, a brother, to talk to you for a few words. But I have one thing I must state, which is that it is best not to publish my name in the newspaper." I nodded at the time. (Now it seems that I have lost my credibility. If Mr. Zhang, you see this piece of writing, I offer you twelve thousand apologies.) We were silent for about two minutes between us. I began to ask him, "Mr. Zhang, what are Mr. Feng's opinions on the current Sino-Japanese war? At the same time, when will Mr. Feng's method of resisting Japan be realized?" He rolled his eyes upward twice, opened his thick lips, and spoke in a very loud voice, as if giving a speech in front of a large crowd. He said to me, "Mr. Feng always feels that the biggest disadvantage is that we cannot fight the war with the entire nation united. The defeat of our army in Luandong was not a combat failure, but a failure of the overall strategy. The command cannot be unified, so the enemy's advance is even faster. As for Mr. Feng's anti-Japanese proposal, it cannot be realized. On this point, we must understand Mr. Feng's difficulties. He is not just shouting anti-Japanese slogans like others, but he has no opportunity to realize them." "Then what kind of view does Mr. Feng have on the future of Chahar Province?" He shook his head slightly, and a smile quickly flashed across his lips. At the same time, his speech-like voice became a little lower. "Chahar? Mr. Feng will preserve it no matter what. Mr. Feng has long said that he is willing to be shot to death by the Japanese artillery to fulfill his anti-Japanese wish. Sir, you watch, Mr. Feng will definitely be supported by the people in the near future." Supported by the people, what a resounding sentence. I listened quietly to his endless eloquent remarks. We talked for about an hour. Finally, I said to him again, "Mr. Zhang, it is best to find a way to have me talk to Mr. Feng for a few words." He pondered for a moment. "Okay, you listen to the phone." In this way, we, Christ General's representative, Mr. Zhang Jiurong, shook hands heartily with each other and said goodbye in the lamplight. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Problem of Reorganizing the Luandong Puppet Army is Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>A special dispatch from Beiping: After the ceasefire agreement was established, the Japanese troops in the counties of Hebei Province mostly remained in their original defenses without withdrawing. Except for their baggage and artillery, which were transported away first, only a few infantry units moved. The puppet army in Luandong once requested to be reorganized by us. The authorities were quite hesitant about the handling method, believing that if the puppet army repented and sincerely returned, then their past could be forgiven and they could be given a new path. However, after being reorganized, they must be transferred to other places. At a minimum, the puppet army should be moved away from Luandong, retrained, and thoroughly reformed. As a result, the two sides had different opinions, and this issue was temporarily put on hold. Our side also prepared to resolve the issue of reorganization by force if necessary, but the proposal has now been abandoned. Meanwhile, Li Jichun, the leader of the puppet army, still repeatedly requested reorganization, but was firmly rejected by us. Later, after Li's repeated requests, expressing no other intention, the Hebei Provincial Government no longer insisted on rejecting the reorganization. However, the transfer and training must comply with our intentions, otherwise, other solutions should still be sought and no leniency would be shown. Li Jichun and his ilk's intentions are entirely for personal gain and have no established views. However, because the Japanese side does not want the puppet army to be transferred away from Luandong, they have secretly expressed opposition. Relying on their guidance, it is difficult to disobey. For a time, they did not want to give up the Luandong area immediately. This matter is currently under discussion, and there is no concrete solution yet. The puppet army near Yangzhuang in Ninghe, according to official announcements, has withdrawn to Sandaqiao. Japanese troops from Dongwo occasionally send scouts to the Yangzhuang area to reconnoiter. The Lutai area is quiet and unchanged. Regarding the opening of the Beining Railway between Pingyu, it will still take some time. The Railway Bureau, due to the delayed recovery of lost territory, has proposed to restore traffic ahead of schedule. If there are no safety problems in the future, a trial run can be started. However, it will be at least ten days later. East of Tongzhou, in the areas of Daxiao Dongzhuang northeast of the canal, the puppet army has not only not withdrawn but has continued to increase, buying off unemployed Hui people nearby to act as guides, and harassing villages from time to time, looting, raping, and doing whatever they please. In Xiji, the puppet army attacked and looted everything. The two largest wineries in the district, which is known for producing wine, suffered a total loss of fifty to sixty thousand yuan. The suburbs of Tongzhou are very peaceful. Most of the Japanese troops are concentrated in Sanhe. Many refugees have returned to their hometowns. The villages far east of Tongzhou, because they cannot bear the harassment of the puppet army, have all fled to Tongzhou to seek refuge with relatives and friends to escape temporarily. Even if the puppet army issue can be resolved smoothly in the future, banditry will still be inevitable. The future hidden worries still await the authorities to plan and find ways to eliminate them, so that the people can be safe. Therefore, all the follow-up work in North China is very important.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Motegi Cavalry Brigade in Chahar East is now concentrated in Duolun. Liu Guitang's puppet army is mostly in Bao(chang) Kang(bao) and Guyuan. There are also many puppet troops in Guyuan. Since yesterday (9th), the puppet army has stopped advancing west, seemingly watching and waiting. The central government originally did not want to expand the Zhangyuan crisis, but since the Japanese and puppet armies have a tendency to actively covet Zhangbei, if Zhangjiakou falls into enemy hands, then Pingjin will be in a tense situation again. The future is very worrying. After repeated consultations by various parties, it was generally advocated to handle everything with peaceful means. It is heard that the military authorities have a proper plan for maintaining security in Chahar Province. In order to avoid disputes, the government has repeatedly telegraphed the Political Committee stationed in Pingjin to seek a solution quickly. Huang Fu has been carrying out disposal matters with He Yingqin and other dignitaries, proceeding with seven parts political power and three parts military power at the same time. Regarding Feng Yuxiang's personal whereabouts, they are doing their best to use political methods to promote unity. Regarding the puppet bandits and other troops in Chahar, they are determined to settle them militarily, seeking to realize this in the shortest possible time. Jia Deyao's previous trip to Zhang was in a private capacity, to meet with Feng to make some statements. After returning to Ping, he visited He Yingqin and Huang Fu last night to report on the course of this trip. Wu Yong, the director of the Chahar Civil Affairs Office, also arrived in Ping yesterday. This morning, the 10th, he visited Song Zheyuan. Song immediately convened Qin Decun, Zhang Zhiping, Feng Zhian, etc. in his residence in Xicheng Wuyiku for consultations, which did not end until noon. According to those close to Feng Yuxiang, Feng has always hoped that the anti-Japanese military affairs will be consistent with the central government, and that all Chahar provincial affairs will still be presided over by the lower government, with Feng personally willing to assist in everything. There has been much speculation about Feng in recent days. It has been rumored that Feng will finally go abroad, but this is an overstatement. (10th)</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<h3>Two Shipping Vessels Robbed Midway</h3>
<p>The two shipping vessels, Xu Genhu and Lu Achun, operating between Suzhou and Guangfu, were fully loaded with loquats. On the morning of the 12th, around 2:00 AM, they departed from Dongshan to Suzhou. While traveling about ten miles from Mu’du, near the Dongkuatang Bridge in Hengtang Township, they were suddenly encountered by a bandit boat carrying seven or eight bandits. The bandits blocked the road and robbed them. Two bandits, each holding a handgun, opened fire first. One bandit shot Lu Axiao, a crew member on Xu Genhu’s boat, in the right leg. They then robbed for about twenty minutes before leaving. The two boats were robbed of about twenty or thirty yuan in silver dollars. Fortunately, the remaining loquats and other goods were not lost. After the incident, the two boats opened to Suzhou and reported to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Resumes Operations, Labor Disputes</h3>
<p>The Yanchangheng Silk Factory, located outside Fengmen, near Mudu Bridge, had previously ceased operations due to the decline in the silk market. The silk market has recently shown signs of improvement this year, so it continued operations.</p>
<p>However, the factory had over seven hundred male and female workers. Since the factory stopped operating, they had been unemployed for a long time. This time, when operations continued, they all hoped to return to work at the factory. However, the factory had already hired new workers, so they were greatly disappointed. They elected representatives to petition the Mudu Bridge Township Office, which in turn requested the county government for relief. Magistrate Zou especially ordered the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday (12th) and sent a letter to the County Party Headquarters to mediate and avoid disputes.</p>
<h3>Defrauding Diamond Rings, Fleeing to Suzhou, Arrested</h3>
<p>Chen Zong, twenty-eight years old, from Wuxi, recently defrauded Yunying, a prostitute at the China Hotel on Beijing Road in Shanghai, of two diamond rings. After pawning them in Shanghai, he fled to Suzhou and resided at the home of Jin Yuehua, a prostitute at No. 8 Minqing Lane outside the gate. After receiving a report, Captain Xu of the Anti-Banditry Department's Detective Team in this area dispatched detectives yesterday (12th) at 7:00 AM and successfully apprehended Chen Zong. They immediately took the team and presented him to the Anti-Banditry Department to await extradition to Shanghai for interrogation.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<h3>Petition to Strictly Limit Autumn Seed Quantity</h3>
<p>The spring silkworm crop in the Wuxi area this year was excellent and of high quality. The price was also higher than in previous years. Silkworm farmers are pre-ordering autumn seeds and raising autumn silkworms in large numbers in the hopes of making a harvest in the sunset years. However, according to the statistics of the Silkworm Industry Control Office, the entire province of Jiangsu had more than 1.4 million sheets of spring seeds this year. If the harvest is good, there will be less elimination. According to the forecast, it will exceed the amount by 20%. The actual production will be at least 1.6 million sheets. According to the decision of the Silkworm Industry Control Committee to divide spring and autumn breeding as 30% and 70%, respectively, then this year's autumn seeds will total 956,000 sheets, which can be used for raising autumn silkworms in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. However, various seed production farms, due to the strong sales of autumn seeds, have broken the 30-70 limit, and some have even produced all autumn seeds. Not only will spring seeds be lacking next year, but the limited mulberry leaves this year will inevitably cause great panic. Yesterday, Gu, the president of the Farmers Bank, together with the Provincial Public Education Institute, the County Party Headquarters, the Chamber of Commerce, the Agricultural Extension Institute, and the silk and cocoon guilds petitioned the Construction Department to strictly order all seed production farms to limit the amount of autumn seeds to no more than 60% to avoid the great danger of too many silkworms and too few leaves and a lack of spring seeds next year.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Requests Exemption from Defense Donations</h3>
<p>The various shipping companies in Wuxi received a letter from the County Defense Association informing them that starting in July of this year, they would begin collecting shipping donations, collecting five li with the ticket price. They convened a meeting yesterday to discuss the matter. They all believed that the shipping industry is currently in a slump. Routes such as Jiangyin have mostly been suspended. Even the few routes that are barely maintained are also reducing prices to attract customers. This is due to the collapse of the rural economy and the declining number of passengers. Many have stopped operating. If defense donations are collected again, it will inevitably affect passengers and make it even more impossible to maintain operations. They should follow the resolution of the previous County Chamber of Commerce meeting. The commercial sector has difficulty bearing the burden and requests that all collections be stopped. They have sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce requesting that it forward the letter to the county government to exempt the aforementioned defense donations.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<h3>No One Responsible for Rural Teachers' School</h3>
<p>This spring, the principal of Xitangqiao Rural Normal School, Qian Qin, became addicted to opium, and after being accused by local people, Qian resigned. The Education Bureau then recommended Shen Chenglie, the former director of the Changshu Education Bureau, to succeed him. However, after the appointment order was issued by the Education Department, Shen was unwilling to take office, and the appointment order was returned. As a result, for three or four months, no one was in charge of the Normal School. The two-year students are about to graduate, and the certificates will not have the signature of the person in charge of the school, which will definitely affect them in the future. They once went to the Education Bureau to petition, and then Ge, the director of the Education Bureau, personally went to Shanghai to urge Shen, the new principal, to cancel his resignation and take office immediately. Shen initially stated that he would take office after the summer vacation, and the school affairs would be temporarily handed over to the academic dean and the teaching staff. Unexpectedly, after a group discussion on the 10th, the teaching staff felt that the responsibility was too heavy and seemed inappropriate, so they decided to submit a collective resignation to the Education Bureau. As for the students, seeing that the teaching staff had expressed such an attitude, they were even more affected by the graduation, and the three-year students, although they had not yet finished this term, also opposed the Education Department's order to extend the three-year system by one year. Starting on the 12th of this month, they all went on strike, marched to the city in formation, and petitioned the county government.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<h3>Tonghai Qidong Military and Police Lift Martial Law</h3>
<p>Due to bandits planning to cause chaos, the three counties of Nantong, Haimen, and Qidong, after military and police investigation, learned that the headquarters were near Temple Street in Nantong City. They immediately searched and arrested the key criminal Liu Fusheng. For days, they also arrested his followers everywhere, successively capturing three key leaders, and sent them to the county government for secret interrogation. Due to the search for hidden bandits, temporary martial law was imposed, but the case has now been solved and martial law has been lifted.</p>
<h3>Seven Bandits Harass Pingchao</h3>
<p>Bandits are harassing the area of Lijia Ferry in Pingchao. Police and militia have been dispatched to suppress them, scattering the bandits. On the 11th, more than 20 male and female bandits were captured, along with their weapons, and sent to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<h3>Water Police Personnel Accused of Extortion</h3>
<p>Jiang Xianfa, Zhou Zhipeng, Zhang Yanli, and three other investigators from the 5th Water Police Team in Jiaxing, on the pretext of intimidating Xiangchang Wang Yuzuo's family in the 7th District, extorted 500 yuan in ocean from Bao Jinlan, the deputy director of Qianliu Township, and his son Bao Guifu. After the news was heard by groups such as Xin Shengshang and Nongtuan, they telegraphed the province, county, and team to request an investigation. The 5th Water Police Team replied by telegram, awaiting the transfer of Jiang et al. to the court for interrogation. The victim, Bao Guifu, also filed a complaint with the Jiaxing District Court. Yesterday, the Prosecutor's Office summoned a thousand people to testify and opened a court for interrogation. The defendants Jiang Xianfa, Zhou Zhipeng, and Zhang Yanli did not report. After questioning the attendees, Prosecutor Tong Xianzhi ordered the defendants Wang Yuzuo and Peng Yuquan to be released on bail, awaiting further summons.</p>
<p>Fuyang</p>
<h3>Mountain Floods Burst, Qiantang River Overflows</h3>
<p>Fuyang is located in the middle reaches of the Qiantang River, surrounded by mountains on all sides. Recently, summer rains have been continuous, and mountain floods have burst. The water from the upper reaches of the river flowed rapidly downstream. The paddy fields everywhere were washed away. At this time of bankruptcy and the collapse of the rural economy, we also have to encounter natural disasters, which is very painful.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipality Levies Provisional Land Value Tax</h3>

<h3>Yesterday's Reception for the Press</h3>
<p>Report on the Huabei War Zone Relief Efforts</p>
<p>And Discussions with Various Sectors on Future Relief Measures</p>
<p>Xiong Xiling, President of the China General Association of the World Red Swastika Society and Vice Chairman of the Northeast Refugee Relief Association, hosted a reception for reporters from various newspapers at the Xinghua Restaurant on Fuzhou Road yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. He reported on the situation of the Huabei War Zone relief efforts and subsequent measures. More than 40 reporters from various newspapers attended and were personally received by Mr. Xiong. The details of the report are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Relief Efforts During the Incident in Yuguan and Rehe</h3>
<p>The Association formed 14 relief teams which were immediately dispatched to Chaoyang, Lingyuan, Kailu, Qinhuangdao and other places to provide relief to wounded soldiers and refugees. As Chengde fell and the war expanded, the original relief teams were insufficient to meet the needs. The Association convened a major relief conference of the All-China Red Swastika Society, deciding to expand the relief efforts, and added more than ten special relief teams, for a total of 27 teams before and after. I, along with Mr. Xu Lanzhou, personally led the teams to the Xifengkou, Lengkou, Luanxian, and Great Wall areas to intensify our work, providing both medical care for wounded soldiers and relief for refugees. In addition to running temporary hospitals in the rear to treat wounded soldiers, we also established more than ten refugee shelters in Beijing, Tianjin and Chahar, taking in refugees. Over three months, we spent more than 400,000 yuan. This money was jointly contributed by the Association's headquarters and various branches.</p>
<h3>Post-Disaster Measures After my departure</h3>
<p>the situation in Beijing and Tianjin became increasingly tense, and hundreds of thousands of refugees from various places fled to the Beijing and Tianjin areas. The Association added more than ten temporary shelters, accommodating more than 50,000 refugees. These refugees had mostly lost all their property and their homes were in ruins. Without thorough post-disaster measures for their current maintenance and future resettlement, they would have nothing to live on even after returning to their hometowns. Furthermore, during the height of the war, there were many casualties among the soldiers, the survivors were mostly disabled, and the families of the deceased were still awaiting support. Therefore, establishing rehabilitation centers for the disabled and providing compensation to the families of the fallen are also urgent matters. Since this war was not a formal declaration of war, international wartime laws were ineffective. Tens of thousands of corpses were scattered along the several thousand miles of the war zone along the Great Wall, all within the line of fire, and have not been adequately buried. Geographically, the Chahe River at Gubeikou, the Luanhe River at Xifengkou, the Ji Canal at Xinglong County, and the Shihe River at Shimenzhai all originate outside the Great Wall in Rehe Province. The rainy season in the north is at the end of May. If we do not take advantage of this ceasefire period to bury the dead, (even those who have already been buried, except for the soldiers of General Song's unit who died at Xifengkou, for whom the Association has built a public cemetery that is relatively well-maintained), the rest were hastily buried due to the intensity of the war and the urgency of time. Therefore, it is necessary to dig deeper and rebury them, both out of respect for humanity and for hygiene.</p>
<h3>Jointly Launch Relief Efforts If heavy rains come</h3>
<p>the corpses are swept into the river, the drinking water for the Chinese and foreign populations of Beijing and Tianjin will be at risk of contamination and disease. However, to seriously undertake this task in a war zone spanning thousands of miles, it will require more than a thousand laborers. Therefore, epidemic prevention work in the war zone must also be carried out immediately. The Association has already done its best to provide medical care on the front and rear lines, and the relief teams dispatched earlier are still working in various places to provide refugee shelter and treatment, not daring to slacken. However, the various issues mentioned above are extremely important and cannot be accomplished by the efforts of one association alone. Therefore, I have made a special trip to Shanghai to discuss with philanthropists in Shanghai future cooperative relief measures. Fortunately, I have received their approval and willingness to cooperate. It is expected that a Huabei War Zone Post-Disaster Relief Committee will be established to handle these matters. The relief tasks are numerous and complex, and require our joint efforts. Gentlemen of the press are all leaders of society, and have always been enthusiastic in supporting social welfare and various relief efforts. I hope that you will awaken people from all walks of life to jointly launch relief efforts, and I hope that you will provide guidance at any time so that we can complete the post-disaster work in the Huabei war zone. The suffering people of the time kowtow in request.</p>
<h3>Results of Discussions With Reporters In response to questions about the results</h3>
<p>of this trip to Shanghai, Mr. Xiong said that during the September 18th Incident, Zhang Xueliang lost the territory of the three northeastern provinces, an area of more than 400,000 square miles, due to his policy of non-resistance. The news spread far and wide, shocking the world. Whenever people from various countries inquired about it, I could only shake my head and sigh, unable to say anything. During the January 28th Incident, the 19th Route Army fought bravely against the Japanese, holding out for a month. Although a ceasefire agreement was signed due to various reasons, international prestige increased as a result, and I was very pleased. During the Yuguan and Rehe Incidents, our troops continued to resist, and General Song Zheyuan's division was the most valiant, with only over two thousand survivors. In total, more than 60,000 people were injured and more than 10,000 were disabled as a result of these battles. The people in the rear donated more than 60 million worth of rice, wheat, and firewood. It is appropriate to find solutions for these wounded soldiers and refugees so that the survivors will not be displaced. Therefore, after my arrival in Shanghai, I consulted with the Renji Hall and various parties, and found some leads. Philanthropists have generously stepped forward to help. Your publicity through speech is also no small contribution. Therefore, I have only prepared wine today to express my gratitude. I hope that the general public will unite sincerely and work together with one heart. The example of Goujian's defeat of Wu should serve as a warning. I am willing to work together with you to this end.</p>

<h3>Telegram Announcing Imminent Arrival in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Generals Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen sent a telegram from Nanchang yesterday to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Shanghai Liaison Office of the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association, the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, the Shanghai Security Bureau, and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. The telegram reads: "Mayor Wu Tiecheng of Shanghai, General Zhu Ziqiao, Chairman Chu Huiseng, Director Yang Xiaotian, Commander Dai Xiaokun, respectfully noted. Zhanshan and others arrived in Shanghai some days ago. We are deeply grateful for your warm hospitality. After departing, we went to Beijing to meet with various officials, and in the evening, we boarded the Yongjian ship to Jiangxi, arriving in the province at noon. After meeting with the Chairman and receiving instructions, we will return to Shanghai to receive instructions. With respect, Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen kowtow. True."</p>

<p>The Second German Aircraft Arrived in Shanghai This Morning</p>
<h3>Flying to Beijing Yesterday from Lanzhou</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, two new aircraft of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation arrived in China via Europe and Russia at the end of last month. One aircraft completed the test flight of the Eurasia route a few days ago and arrived in Shanghai. The other aircraft returned to Dihua to deliver the Xinjiang Envoy and arrived on the 10th and then returned east to Shanghai to complete the 10,000-kilometer Eurasia route. The aircraft took off from Lanzhou yesterday morning and arrived in Beijing at 7 pm, staying overnight and planning to come to Shanghai this morning, estimated to arrive around 10 am. According to the manager of the company, Li Jingcong, the German and Russian sides have reached an agreement on Eurasia joint transportation. If the Xinjiang rebellion can be quelled, it can fly to Tacheng in early July and connect with the Russian and German routes. Regarding the Northwest route, tomorrow (i.e. today) is the opening date, so it is decided to use the M-34 aircraft newly flown from Berlin, Germany, because its capacity is larger and it can carry more passengers and mail. However, after the aircraft has flown a long distance of 10,000 kilometers, it must be inspected to avoid mechanical failures. The inspection work is currently underway and will be completed tomorrow (i.e. today), so the sailing date has been postponed by one day and will depart on the morning after tomorrow (i.e. tomorrow morning).</p>
<p>Dai Ji, the Songhu Garrison Commander, returned to Shanghai by ship on the 9th from Fuzhou, and the next day went to Suzhou to see his wife's illness. Yesterday morning at 8 o'clock, he returned to Shanghai from Suzhou by night train and went to the Longhua Garrison Headquarters at 9 o'clock to work, ending his leave and taking up his duties. A reporter from this newspaper visited the headquarters yesterday morning and was met by Xu Yiheng, the director of the headquarters' secretariat, who said that Commander Dai's visit to Fujian this time was entirely to handle the handover of the 61st Division and to meet with Chen Mingshu and others. The rumors that he was representing the Central Government to explain misunderstandings were all speculation and not true. Commander Dai had no position on the national situation and only knew to obey orders and be stationed in Shanghai, and would do his best to fulfill his responsibilities.</p>
<p>Navy Self-Made Aircraft</p>
<h3>Today's City Flight</h3>
<p>Long-Distance Flight Will Depart on Friday and Saturday This Week</p>
<p>According to the Guo Wen News Agency, Zeng Yijing, director of the Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Plant, recently plans to fly the self-made Jiangfeng aircraft on a long-distance flight over the Yangtze River. Yesterday, the reporter met with Zeng at Gaochang Temple. According to Zeng, there are more than 100 workers in the plant, and it is planned to build six aircraft each year, but due to economic relations, only two aircraft can be produced. The Naval Department currently allocates approximately 6,000 yuan per month for expenses. The fees approved by the Central Political Committee for additional allocation are the 300,000 yuan recently proposed for purchasing materials. During the Yang Ministerial era, it was also proposed to avoid buying aircraft with money. Zeng proposed (1) expanding the Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Plant and actively manufacturing aircraft; (2) when the central government purchases aircraft from abroad,</p>

<p>It is necessary to propose that a part of the aircraft be manufactured by the manufacturing plant itself, but this case has not been implemented so far. For the purpose of promoting self-made aircraft, I recently made a long-distance flight. It has now been decided to first conduct a city (Shanghai) flight tomorrow (i.e. today), and the long-distance flight is scheduled for this Friday and Saturday, and will depart when the weather is good. The landing points are Nantong, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, Hankou, Yuezhou, Changsha, Shashi, and Yichang, then return to Shanghai. After a few days of rest, fly to Ningbo, Wenzhou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou. The Jiangfeng aircraft will be left at the Mawei Aviation Office as a training aircraft, and I will return to Shanghai by boat. Currently, one aircraft manufactured by this plant will be completed by the end of the year and will be deployed on the Ninghai ship. As for the Jiangfeng aircraft for long-distance flight, it was manufactured in 1931. The engine is American Rott type, with a horsepower of 1654, a fully loaded weight of 1116 kg, a firing speed of 190 kilometers, a cruising speed of 157 kilometers, a landing speed of 91 kilometers, a sea level ascent of 136 meters, and a peak altitude of 3810 meters. The type of seaplane is for reconnaissance training, etc.</p>
<p>According to the Guo Wen News Agency, Mr. Zeng Yijing is an expert in self-made aircraft in China. With low funds and simple factories, based on his knowledge and great perseverance, he finally created many military aircraft such as Jiangfeng and Jianghe. He will conduct a test flight in seven provinces tomorrow, and in the future, aviation to save the country will not depend on others. His work is very great. Mr. Zeng has an article "The Success of Self-Made Aircraft in Our Country", published in the first issue of the Far East Monthly. If you want to read the first self-made aircraft in our country, you can attach a stamp of one corner and send a letter to the newspaper office at No. 221 Saipo Road to read it.</p>
<h3>Painful Words of Northeastern Returnees</h3>
<p>Japan Wants to Destroy My Northeast Nationalities with the Old Tricks of Destroying Korea</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the National Communication Agency met with Mr. Zhang Zhichen, a teacher at a primary school in Changchun, who fled from the Northeast. He told us in detail the recent situation of the puppet organization and the various sinister plots of the Japanese to rule the Northeast. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Duntou Railway</h3>
<p>The Duntou Railway (from Dunhua to Tumen River), which is a section of the former Jihui Railway, has been under active construction by the Japanese since mid-May last year under the entrustment of the South Manchurian Railway Company. It was fully completed and announced on April 20 this year and has begun commercial operations. The entire line is 192 kilometers long, starting from Dunhua and passing through 15 stations: Daqiao, Dashitou, Haberling, Nangou, Liangbingtai, Mingyuegou, Chatiaogou, Yushuchuan, Laotou Gou, Tongfosi, Chaoyangchuan, Yanji, Mopanshan, Weizigou, Nanyang, and reaching Tumen River. In the future, the Japanese army in Korea can directly reach North Manchuria by this railway. Before this railway was completed, the Japanese army in Korea had to transfer via Dalian to reach North Manchuria. Now, they can directly reach North Manchuria from Duntou and Dunji, which is much faster than in the past. Moreover, the counties along the Duntou Railway are the richest in production in the Northeast. The annual output of goods is over 4,210,297,511,407 shi, the area is 45,440 square miles, and the population is 700,7370 people. Now, they have all fallen into the hands of the Japanese, and it is truly heartbreaking to say that recovery is out of the question.</p>
<h3>Two Planned Roads</h3>
<p>After the completion of the Duntou Railway, the Japanese plan to build the Laha Railway (from Lafa to Harbin) and the Yanhai Railway (from Yanji to Hailin) to rule my entire Northeast and develop various rich resources. This plan has already begun to prepare and a large number of engineers have been sent to inspect and measure along the two lines. Construction is expected to begin in August and September of this year.</p>
<h3>Tax Revenue Drops Sharply Compared to Before</h3>
<p>Since the puppet organization was declared established under the wing of the Japanese, all administrative powers have been controlled by the Japanese. The puppet Puyi has no right to interfere. In order to settle unemployed Japanese in the Northeast, the Japanese have tried their best to increase the number of institutions, and some organizations have as many as twenty or more departments, with up to 600 employees. Therefore, expenditures have increased sharply, and the import of Japanese goods into the territory of the puppet organization is also exempt from tariffs, resulting in a sharp drop in tax revenue. Compared to before the September 18th Incident, it is short by six-tenths. In order to balance the budget, the Japanese authorities levy various exorbitant taxes on Chinese operating in the interior and vigorously enforce the public sale of opium to increase their income. Currently, opium dens are everywhere in the territory of the puppet organization, and each opium pipe is taxed one yuan in Manchu currency per day, which is euphemistically called entertainment donation. Other places such as gambling dens and brothels are even more numerous. In short, the Northeastern compatriots have become the fish on the Japanese knife.</p>
<h3>Volunteer Army Rises Up on the Occasion</h3>
<p>However, there is one thing that is enough to comfort me, that is, the volunteer army in various places is becoming more and more active because the green gauze account has started. Currently, the Kwantung Army of the Japanese army has formulated a plan to encircle and suppress this volunteer army, hoping to eliminate the confidant's trouble as soon as possible. The volunteer army is unpredictable and its whereabouts are uncertain, and there are also no lack of patriotic people in the puppet army who are waiting for an opportunity to revolt, so the Japanese tricks have been detected by the volunteer army and they can calmly deal with them. The strategy adopted by the current volunteer army is guerrilla warfare, adhering to the twelve-character secret of "you come, I go," "avoid the important and take the light," and "take advantage of the situation," so that the Japanese army cannot carry out a large-scale encirclement. In addition, bandits are everywhere, looting is heard, which makes the Japanese side even more overwhelmed and struggling to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Implementing a Policy of Eradicating the Race Through Writing</h3>
<p>As for the schools in the territory of the puppet organization, the teachers are all Japanese. The curriculum is required to have Japanese as a compulsory subject, which takes up hours every day. English and American languages each take up one hour, and the remaining one hour is half an hour for exercise and half an hour for Chinese. The Japanese desire to destroy the race by destroying the Korean race through writing can be seen here. Moreover, students in the same school, Chinese children must stand at attention and salute when they see Japanese children on the way, otherwise they will be insulted. It is expected that in fifteen years, millions of people in the Northeast will become cattle and horses of the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Chinese Farmers Waiting to Die</h3>
<p>Finally, Mr. Zhang also said that millions of Chinese farmers in various parts of the Northeast are now waiting to die. After the Japanese occupied the Northeast by force, in order to implement their immigration policy, they successively transported unemployed people from various parts of the country to Korea to reclaim wasteland, and then moved Korean farmers to the Northeast empty-handed to reclaim wasteland. Unexpectedly, these Korean farmers had long forgotten the pain of their own country's demise and recognized the thief as their father, arbitrarily seizing the homes of Chinese farmers, snatching cultivated land and agricultural tools as their own. If the Chinese farmers resisted, they were brutally killed, and even forced the Chinese farmers to be their slaves for driving. As for rape and plunder, they are still being spared. Alas, what crime have the farmers in the Northeast committed to be the slaves of slaves in a conquered country? I deeply hope that our government authorities and the people of the whole country will rise up together to save the Northeastern compatriots who have no way to go to heaven and no way to enter the earth, and to preserve a portion of vitality for the country.</p>
<p>Yangtze River Flooding</p>
<h3>Affects Upstream Commercial Goods</h3>
<p>Shayi Hakka Gang Has Telegraphed Shanghai to Reduce Shipping</p>
<p>The Han River was flooded in 2020, reaching 42 feet and 6 inches, which had already flooded the city and turned it into a vast ocean, causing a rare disaster. Last year, the National Government's Flood Relief Committee used American wheat to provide work for relief and built river dikes as a fundamental plan to prevent floods. However, the river water has risen again this year. As of yesterday, the water level in Hankou, according to the telegram, has reached 39 feet and 4 inches, which is only 2 feet and 78 inches lower than the highest water level in the past year. The water is level with the shore in the lower reaches of the river. If the water rises further, it will inevitably enter the city from the ditches, and the newly built dike gate will also be blocked if necessary to prevent danger. Yangtze River ships traveling up and down the river between Jiujiang and Hankou have been banned from express trains. Patrol Jiangsi has added red warning lights to dangerous places along the river to avoid accidents on merchant ships. According to the telegram from Yichang, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the water level continues to increase, exceeding 32 feet. There is no embankment there. If the water increases sharply, there is a danger of flooding the city. Recently, a large number of spun yarn in Shanghai is being shipped to Yichang and Shashi. Due to the impact of the flood, Shayi Hakka Gang has telegraphed to Shanghai, ordering that the spun yarn should not be shipped in full, and only a small part should be loaded first to avoid the flood.</p>
<p>First Batch</p>
<h3>Argentine Wheat Imports</h3>
<p>The First Three Ships Carry 25,000 Tons</p>
<p>A Breakthrough in South American Trade</p>
<p>Agricultural production is overstocked in various countries, and they are suffering from a lack of sales channels. However, the flour mills in our country are greedy for its cheap price and have successively ordered the first batch of American wheat and then Australian wheat. Now they have placed orders to South America, and a batch has been shipped. It is the first time that South American wheat has been shipped to China. The details are reported as follows.</p>
<h3>Purchase Quantity</h3>
<p>After purchasing huge amounts of American and Australian wheat, the major flour mills in Shanghai, such as Fuxin and Maoxin, have also tried to purchase a batch of wheat from South America this year to be shipped to China for comparison. However, because South American wheat has never been sold to the Far East, and there is no precedent for how much flour it produces, the first time they temporarily ordered 60,000 tons of Argentine wheat from foreign merchants on a trial basis to be delivered to Shanghai. The contract was signed long ago.</p>
<h3>Ferry Transport</h3>
<p>The 60,000 tons of South American wheat, after Shuangwen's plans, are to be transported to Shanghai by eight ferries.  Some of it may need to be shipped to Hankou for delivery. The wheat is already being shipped, with three ships carrying a total of 25,000 tons to Shanghai first. The remaining cargo will be carried by five more ships.  The first batch of wheat is managed by Geddes &amp; Co. and De Foe &amp; Co. LkuisDreefuaCo... etc.</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>H&gt; Tuesday (11th)</p>
<p>First Batch Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The first batch shipped out includes the "温古華城" (Wenguhua City) and "温古華之市" (Wenguhua City) vessels.  Both ships have arrived in Shanghai. Among them, the "温古華城" (Wenguhua City) carries 8,162.494 tons (i.e., 8 dan). The customs declaration and unloading are handled by British Tianxiang Foreign Firm. Yesterday, the ship had already sailed to Dongjiadu Yitaixing pier for unloading and is scheduled to open its hatches onto the wharf today.  The wheat carried by the "温古華之市" (Wenguhua City) will also be unloaded today.</p>
<p>Continuous Shipments Coming</p>
<p>South American Argentina has never shipped wheat to China before. This is a pioneering venture for the trade between the two countries. The wheat is shipped from Bahía Blanca (Ｂohia Blana), Argentina.  The remaining goods, yet to arrive, should reach here soon. It is said that the total value of this South American wheat import is estimated at around 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>56th Division Liu He Ding's Troops</p>
<h3>Soldiers Passing Through the Concession</h3>
<p>Released After Inquiry at the Police Station</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency reports that a company of soldiers, about one hundred, from the 166th Brigade of the 56th Division under Liu Heding, were en route from Yingzhou, Anhui, to Fujian. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Beijing, preparing to transfer to ships for Fujian. Upon arrival at the station, the troops were all unarmed and marched in formation through the concession towards the southern part of the city. They proceeded directly past the police station near the Four Roads, where police officers stopped them, concerned that the baggage car following the soldiers might contain military equipment, violating the regulations of the concession. They were instructed to report to the police station. The entire group then stood in the open space of the Four Roads police station. The company commander, Yue Gusheng, entered to explain everything. After about five minutes, the police station understood and did not detain them. They immediately departed southwards and boarded ships at the 16th Pier. Nearby residents and pedestrians were unaware of the true situation, and were surprised to see a large number of soldiers at the police station.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Refuse to Use Indian Cotton</h3>
<p>Textile Association Decided Yesterday</p>
<p>All Factories Have Been Notified Accordingly</p>
<p>Switching to Chinese Cotton or Temporarily Reducing Work</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that since the British government implemented a blockade of Japanese goods, triggering intense commercial warfare against Japan, it has provoked opposition throughout Japan. The Shanghai Japanese Textile Association received a telegram from the Osaka headquarters the day before yesterday, announcing that from now on, all Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai should refuse to use Indian cotton to retaliate. The Japanese Textile Association convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon at 5 PM to discuss measures. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Telegram from Osaka Headquarters</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Anglo-Japanese trade war, the Osaka Japanese Textile Industry Federation immediately telegraphed the Shanghai Japanese Textile Association, instructing all factories to unanimously refuse to use Indian cotton to show support, and also to boycott all other British goods. The translated telegram is as follows: (omitted above) Britain has inexplicably imposed a blockade on our (Japanese self-designation) trade, causing significant losses to our countrymen. The situation is now even more serious. Most of the businesses and factories of our countrymen in Britain have been forced to shut down and quietly return home. Although our countrymen wish to be magnanimous, because it is related to the rise and fall of the national fortune, we must regard it as a particularly serious matter. Our textile industry should especially refuse to use Indian cotton to show retaliation and should earnestly advise overseas Chinese to boycott and not use other British goods until Britain achieves the goal of opening up free trade. We hereby inform your association and hope you will proceed promptly. (omitted below)</p>
<p>Yesterday Evening's Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Textile Association, after receiving the telegram from the Osaka headquarters, immediately convened an emergency meeting at its headquarters yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, gathering more than thirty representatives from Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai. As a result of the meeting, they unanimously insisted on complying with the telegram from the Osaka headquarters. From now on, all will refuse to use Indian cotton and will temporarily use Chinese cotton as a substitute for the unified textile raw materials (i.e., cotton). If Chinese cotton is lacking, they will implement a reduction in work to show their determination. At the same time, the Japanese Residents Association notified all Japanese residents in Shanghai that they will also strictly boycott all kinds of British goods. The meeting lasted until after 7 PM.</p>
<h3>Textile Association Announcement</h3>
<p>At the emergency meeting of Japanese yarn factory representatives yesterday, a draft announcement was also prepared on the spot, printed overnight, and scheduled to be distributed to all Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai this morning for unified compliance. The full text of the announcement is as follows: Regarding the matter of urgent announcement, the British government has recently suddenly implemented a fierce trade war against us and blockaded our trade organizations in England. Our association received a telegram from the Osaka headquarters, instructing to immediately instruct all overseas Chinese merchants and yarn factories in Shanghai to uniformly refuse to use Indian cotton from now on to show retaliation. Our association convened a representative conference yesterday to discuss measures and decided to take a resolute attitude and strong spirit, absolutely comply with the Osaka headquarters' telegram, completely refuse to purchase and use Indian cotton, and temporarily substitute it with Chinese cotton. If Chinese cotton is lacking, Indian cotton must not be purchased privately, cutting off the path of patriotism. They should immediately reduce work with pain to show their determination. We hope that all factories will comply with it as a whole. This is a special announcement.</p>
<p>Belgian Envoy Arrived in Beijing Last Night</p>
<h3>Reciprocal Visit to Our Country's Authorities</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Belgian Minister, Mr. Guillaume Keumueller, along with the newly appointed Counselor of the Embassy, Mr. Bellefroid, took the night express train to Beijing last night to meet with President Wang and Foreign Minister Luo. This trip by Minister Keumueller is to introduce Mr. Bellefroid's arrival.</p>
<p>Huge Sum of Cash Shipped to America</p>
<p>Totaling Over Four Million Yuan</p>
<p>Mostly Xianfeng Era Yuanbao</p>
<p>The United States needs cash and has been collecting and shipping it in large quantities from our country for five or six times. This time, the Pacific Mail Steamship President Hoover of the American Dollar Steamship Lines is exporting another 760 boxes of cash, estimated at 3.8 million taels, to the United States. Most of the cash consists of 5-tael and 10-tael ingots, mostly cast during the Xianfeng era. There are also silver coins, but in very small quantities. The cash is being reported for shipment by a foreign bank in Shanghai and is being shipped directly to New York for unloading. It is said that shipping silver from Shanghai to the United States is very profitable in terms of market price. For every million taels of cash shipped from Shanghai to the United States, there is a net profit of 65,000 to 80,000 taels of silver.</p>
<p>Revision of the Yangjingbang Regulations</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Corps Said to Have Approved</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that regarding the approval of the revised Yangjingbang Regulations and its annexes by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, after the Shanghai Consular Corps passed it and submitted it to the Beijing Diplomatic Corps for consideration, it is rumored among foreigners in Shanghai that the Diplomatic Corps, at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, postponed its consideration. However, the Xinsheng News Agency reporter learned from reliable sources yesterday that the so-called postponement is not a long-term shelving of the matter. Therefore, the Diplomatic Corps has recently been considering the matter as usual and it is said that it has already been passed after the Diplomatic Corps meeting. However, before the discussion between the municipal government and the Municipal Council on the factory inspection issue has a possible resolution, they will remain silent for the time being and do not intend to take any actions such as announcing or notifying the approval. Once it is officially announced by the authorities, it will be enough to anger the Chinese (in the foreigners' tone). Therefore, the Consular Corps did not officially announce it last time when it was passed. Although neither the Consular Corps nor the Municipal Council has received an official notification of approval from the Diplomatic Corps, they both know privately that it has been passed.</p>
<h3>Han Liru Arrived in Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Han Liru, a member of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, retreated into the Soviet Union last winter with Chairman Ma. It is now known that Mr. Han arrived in Shanghai on the Shablogan ship some days ago and has traveled to Beijing yesterday to report everything to the central government.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Talks About Wheat and Cotton Loans</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Mr. Kong Xiangxi, President of the Central Bank, met with reporters yesterday morning to discuss issues such as the 50 million US dollar wheat and cotton loan contract. The main points of his talk are as follows:</p>
<h3>Kong on Wheat and Cotton Loans: My Trip</h3>
<p>to Beijing is not to discuss the Sino-American wheat and cotton loan with the government. However, I understand that although the loan contract was signed by Finance Minister Song Ziwen in the United States with the US government, it is only a form of loan, indicating that the Chinese government is willing to accept this loan from the US government. The distribution and delivery of US products have not yet been negotiated, so we cannot decide how to allocate it. However, because raw material prices are high for the national commercial yarn factories and flour mills, leading to production difficulties and many shutdowns, the American wheat and cotton will be directly distributed to the factories in the future to alleviate the hardship of the lack of raw materials. The amount of repayment is 10 million yuan per month, which is not difficult to raise.</p>
<h3>Bank Affairs: Central Bank Expands Treasury</h3>
<p>Department, Prepares to Establish Treasury Bureau: Due to the expansion of the organization, the expenditure budget must be increased. The new budget must be passed by the administrative meeting when the next fiscal year begins. Therefore, although it is actively preparing, the establishment date will be after July.</p>
<p>County Government County Political Meeting</p>
<h3>Resolved the Retention or Abolition of Grain Depots</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government held its 153rd county political meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. Chairman Cao County Magistrate (1) County Magistrate submitted for discussion: Regarding the request from the Grain Tax Collection Office to continue adding grain depot staff dormitories, how should it be handled? Resolved: (A) The relocation funding is currently exhausted and there is no extra land available for construction in the new governing area. The requested additional construction of grain depot staff dormitories should not be discussed. (B) The Cao Tang and Minhang sub-depots will temporarily remain as they are.</p>
<p>Mint Audit Committee</p>
<h3>Will Inspect New Coins According to Regulations</h3>
<p>To Be Released for Circulation on the Market on the First of Next Month</p>
<p>After the Central Mint began minting new coins, Chief Technician Krand arrived in Shanghai to work at the factory. The audit committee decided to inspect the new coins immediately and release them for circulation on the market on the first of next month. Details on the establishment of factory rules are as follows:</p>
<h3>Second General Meeting of New Coin Audit Committee</h3>
<p>Resolved: The Standing Committee will submit the new coins to inspection organizations both in Shanghai and other ports for inspection. The inspection organizations in Shanghai include the Public Concession Municipal Council, the Central Research Institute, and the Chemical Examination Department of Jiaotong University. Other ports include Tianjin and Beiping. The Standing Committee decided to randomly select one to three coins from every 10,000 coins to be submitted to the inspection organizations for inspection of their quality and weight to see if they meet the legal requirements (i.e., the tolerance should not exceed three thousandths). It is heard that before the chemical examiners are hired, they will be submitted to the Municipal Council for chemical examination. It is scheduled to be formally released and circulated on the market on the first of next month.</p>
<h3>Trial Casting of Factory Bars: Chief Technician Krand of the Central Mint</h3>
<p>arrived in Shanghai and immediately went to work at the factory. He also prepared detailed plans and contributed to their adoption. As for the new model coins, they are being minted day and night, with a daily output of more than 200,000 yuan. After the audit committee inspects them, factory bars will be cast, each bar worth 1,000 yuan, weighing 715 taels, for the large-scale storage of cash. In the future, they will also be inspected by the audit committee. Trial casting has already been carried out. The date of issue has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>China</p>
<h3>Cotton Production Improvement Association Annual Meeting: Preliminary Hearing</h3>
<p>Important Discussion on the Decline of Domestic Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton shortage in this city has aroused deep social concern. Although the government has established a large Sino-American 50 million cotton and wheat loan, our country, founded on agriculture, has a cotton production that cannot meet the demand, which is a fundamental problem. The construction bureaus of various provinces are now doing their best to improve it. The Cotton Production Improvement Association is scheduled to convene a meeting to discuss it. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Decrease in Domestic Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton-producing regions of our country, such as Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Liaoning, had a national cotton production of 10,220,779 dan in 1918. And Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Liaoning were not included. In 1931, the national cotton production was 6,399,780 dan, a difference of more than one-third. The reasons for the decrease are roughly the unstable political situation, years of drought and flood, dumping of foreign cotton, reduced purchasing power, and the resulting rural decline.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Test Fields</h3>
<p>The government, in order to promote and improve cotton planting, established the first cotton cultivation test field in Zhengding in 1915, the second cotton cultivation test field in Tongzhou, and the third cotton cultivation test field in Wuchang. The fourth cotton cultivation test field was established in Beijing in 1918. The Central Government established a model cotton planting field directly under its administration in Zhangde in 1916. Later, due to financial difficulties, they were successively closed. Only the test field in Zhengding was changed to the National Cotton Cultivation Test Field by the Ministry of Industry. Now, the provincial governments are actively promoting it. For example, the construction bureaus of Zhejiang, Hunan, and Shaanxi have all established cotton cultivation test fields. Hubei established a cotton industry improvement committee by cotton merchants.</p>
<h3>Cotton Production Meeting</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the China Cotton Production Improvement Association, it has presented to the Ministry of Industry, seeing that our country's cotton production is backward and the raw materials for clothing cannot be self-sufficient, resulting in huge imports of foreign cotton, foreign yarn, and foreign cloth. 1. Establishing a national cotton cultivation test product. 2. Reorganizing the provincial cotton cultivation test fields in various provinces. 3. Setting up cotton seed fields in suitable cotton-growing counties. The second annual meeting will be held in Shanghai on July 9th and 10th, and important cases such as improving domestic cotton will be put forward for discussion at that time.</p>
<h3>Improvement Plan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a cotton industry expert told a Xinsheng News Agency reporter that it is extremely appropriate to help and improve our country's cotton industry after its decline. 1. Fundamental Solution: Protecting domestic cotton and restricting the import of foreign cotton; systematically organizing the improvement of the cotton industry. 2. Short-term Solution: Cooperation between producers and consumers; promoting domestic cotton and adopting domestic cotton. Moreover, countries that produce cotton all restrict the import of foreign cotton. For example, the United States prohibits the import of all cotton plants and their products, including the entire plant and unprocessed flower clothes seeds, all waste flowers, and cotton used for packaging. It is not allowed to be imported, ostensibly to prevent the boll weevil, but in reality, it fears the invasion of foreign cotton.</p>
<p>Qu Wenliu Telegrammed Request</p>
<h3>Relief for Over Six Thousand Young People, Women, and Children</h3>
<p>The United Association of Shanghai Charity Organizations for Relief of Northeastern Refugees received a telegram yesterday from Qu Yingguang and Feng Yangshan, the permanent directors stationed in Tianjin, reporting on the situation of accommodating refugees. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Xu Jinglao, Wang Yilao, and transferred to all charity organizations and colleagues are well informed. The ash telegram is presumably delivered. According to the report of the chief officer Ma, there are more than 6,000 young people, women, and children in Lutai, who are members of the local Red Swastika Society and have accommodated them in more than ten houses, which is extremely difficult. They have now purchased grain and are heading to provide relief. Photos will be sent separately. Qu Yingguang and Feng Xuefen bowed sincerely.</p>
<h3>North China Relief Reaches a Tense Situation</h3>
<p>According to news from the China Child Welfare Association, since the ceasefire in North China, the general population believed that the refugees could return home, the relief could come to an end, and donations could be stopped. In fact, this is not the case. Recently, Chen Tiesheng, the North China War Zone Relief Representative of the China Child Welfare Association, telegraphed that more than 100,000 refugees in Pingjin are unable to return home, and there are many more refugees from Chahar. Therefore, the shelters in Beiping alone have more than thirty districts. Those trapped in the disaster-stricken areas and unable to escape, such as the refugees in Miyun and Zunhua, are even more miserable. Therefore, Representative Chen has tried to inspect the areas not yet evacuated by the Japanese army and conduct relief. Also, because the children affected by the disaster account for a large proportion and are together with adults, education, hygiene, nutrition, and games have not been taken into consideration. Therefore, the Shanghai Charity Federation, the Northeastern Refugee Relief Association, the Youth Association, the War Zone Service Department, the Beiping Christian Federation, the Beiping Local Association, the Hui Religion, the Catholic Religion, and individuals such as Zhang Yuanshan and Zhang Zhixun have been solicited to assist in managing the welfare of child refugees separately, and the Child Welfare Committee has been organized, and Zhang Yinglin has been appointed as the general manager. The work is extremely tense.</p>

<h3>To Stop Hankou City from Levying Taxes on Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association received a letter from the Hankou Silk and Satin Trade Association, stating that the Hankou business tax collection agency suddenly went to various shops to inspect goods.

They were ordered to pay taxes separately, which the merchants could not afford. They requested assistance in striving for their rights. They immediately telegraphed the Hubei Provincial Government, requesting that it order the Hankou business tax collection agency to comply with the tax laws stipulated by the Ministry and levy taxes based on industry.

<p>Seizing Family Property, a Big Disturbance in the Ancestral Hall</p>
<h3>US Consulate Personally Investigates</h3>
<p>Ms. Shen Cai, a local woman, is 67 years old. She had only one daughter, named Dan Ying, who married Mike Caven (transliteration), an American engineer, and had two daughters, Bao Juan, 16, and Xiu Juan, 15, who are currently studying at Qiming Girls' School. However, Dan Ying passed away in the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915). Mike then married Ms. Chen of Xin Longhua as his second wife, and they now have five children. Because Ms. Cai is old and has no one to rely on, she lives with her goddaughter, Ms. Chen, and her son-in-law, Mike Caven, at No. 22 Chen Family Residence, Tushanwan, West Shanghai, where they have lived for over 20 years. Unexpectedly, Ms. Shen Cai passed away due to illness at around 11:00 AM on the 10th of this month. Her son-in-law, Mike Caven, who is currently in Changzhou building a hydroelectric plant, was immediately telegraphed to return. Upon hearing the news, Mike rushed back to the Chen Family Residence overnight to handle the funeral arrangements. In accordance with Chinese customs and etiquette, he respectfully mourned and provided a dignified burial, showing great filial piety. However, Shen Xiangdi, the nephew of Ms. Shen Cai (a 35-year-old steelworker), gathered a group of people yesterday morning and caused a great disturbance at the mourning hall, forbidding the burial and vehemently demanding inheritance of his aunt's estate from Mike Caven, behaving unreasonably. Unable to bear the harassment, Mike reported the matter to the US consulate. Upon receiving the report, Mr. Meterkert (transliteration), the US consul stationed in Shanghai, visited the Chen Family Residence in the countryside at 11:00 AM yesterday with an interpreter to investigate. He then returned to the Second Branch Office of the Sixth District in Xujiahui to request police protection. After receiving the report, Director Wu immediately dispatched police officers to suppress the disturbance. Shen Xiangdi still dared to unreasonably obstruct Mike Caven, and the police took Shen to the station for temporary detention until the coffin was finally sealed at 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Document Typing Service with Chinese Typewriter</h3>
<p>The Chinese typewriter invented by Mr. Yu Binqi, patented by the National Government, has used all domestic materials since its improvement after the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident). The machine is sturdy, sensitive, and requires little practice to type 30 characters per minute. Government agencies, companies, banks, lawyers, and accountants are all happy to purchase it. However, due to cost limitations, it cannot be universally adopted, which is deeply regrettable. Nevertheless, requests from all sectors continue to pour in. Now, for convenience, a document typing and printing service has been established, specializing in typing documents, official correspondence, and lectures at reasonable prices. Various typewriter fonts are available, all made of steel, resistant to wear, and capable of producing more than ten copies at a time with carbon paper. Using wax paper, hundreds of copies can be printed with a mimeograph machine. In the future, all sectors requiring these services can have them provided. Furthermore, to meet the social demand for typing personnel, a Chinese typewriter training school has been specially established to train typists and introduce them to jobs, also as a means of alleviating unemployment. The office is located at China Industrial Development Company on Sanma Road (Nanjing East Road), where visitors are welcome to view and test the equipment.</p>

He initially only knew that he was going to rob opium, and the guns were issued by Li. There were a total of seven people who went together. Li, I, Kuang Haiqing, Zhang Xinyun, and Xiao Zicheng went inside to rob, Zhang Yucheng stood at the entrance of the alley, and Li Xiaobo was watching the street in front of the car dealership nearby. After the robbery, I only received three yuan. Kuang Haiqing and other defendants admitted to going together, but Kuang Liu and Li Liu gave evasive testimonies. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the testimonies and ordered the defendants to be remanded to custody separately pending a further hearing on the afternoon of the 22nd of this month.</p>

<h3>Central Telegrams</h3>
<p>The representatives of the two industries telegraphed to Chairman Chiang and the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Industry, and Legislative Yuan yesterday, the text of which reads (abbreviated title): "Recently, we have learned that the General Taxation Department intends to change the 1933 tobacco and alcohol tax rates, abolish the public monopoly system, and replace it with a special tax on native tobacco leaves and a fixed tax on native alcohol, with a sudden increase in non-special tax amounts. Moreover, the tax collection starts from every 'jin' (a unit of weight), causing merchants to be harassed by trivial matters. The public monopoly system has been in place for a long time, and the people have been living in relative peace. If this sudden change is implemented, it will be no different from restoring the 'likin' system (internal transit tax). If it is implemented, it will not only increase the burden abruptly but also cause merchants to be blamed at every turn, possibly leading to the complete elimination of native tobacco and alcohol. This is tantamount to promoting foreign goods and destroying domestic products. Moreover, at a time when the commercial and rural economy is bankrupt, we are already struggling to save it. How can we bear to impose further harassment? Thinking about the future, we are extremely anxious. In addition to sending representatives with detailed information on the obstacles encountered in a separate letter, we are forwarding this telegram to request your kind consideration and approval to maintain the old system to reassure businesses and safeguard the livelihood of the people. We are extremely urgent. The United Representative Assembly of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Trade Associations kowtows."</p>

<p>Shen Bao Series</p>
<h3>Summary of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Agricultural Plan</h3>
<p>Translated by Gao Zhi Full book 196 pages Paper cover 6-open format Actual price 50 cents</p>
<p>Although the content of the Soviet Union's five-year construction plan is a general social construction, it particularly focuses on agriculture, that is, the establishment of state labor farms and collective farms, and the industrialization of agriculture. Therefore, it is necessary for us to conduct a special study of the Soviet Union's five-year agricultural plan. This book is translated by Ms. Gao Zhixiang based on the English translation of the report and speech on agricultural construction plans by YAYakovlev, the Soviet Union's People's Commissar for Agriculture. The whole book is divided into five chapters. The first chapter first describes the large-scale agricultural organizations in the United States. Why should we talk about agriculture in the United States first? According to Yakolev: "A full understanding of the progress and current situation of agriculture in the Soviet Union cannot be obtained solely from research in the Soviet Union. In order to avoid errors in one's own evaluation of past results and future goals, it is necessary to begin comparing the new technological methods and large-scale developments in the Soviet Union and other capitalist countries, especially the United States. This comparison can clearly show the various characteristics of agricultural development in the Soviet Union, and it is also easy to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of our work." It can be seen that the importance of this chapter, really, from this comparative narrative, we can more clearly see how completely different the results obtained under two different economic systems are for the same event. The second chapter describes the large-scale agricultural organizations in the Soviet Union, explaining the rapid development of large-scale agriculture in the Soviet Union, the rapid increase of collective farms and state-owned farms, the gradual elimination of rich peasants, the gradual reduction of poor peasants, the full mechanization of agriculture, and the increasing socialization of the means of production; state-owned farms and collective farms have already achieved a substantial victory in the Soviet Union, which is not only empty talk, but has concrete facts to prove it. The third chapter describes the new tasks of agricultural development in the Soviet Union. These new tasks are for the first five-year plan, because the collectivization program in the first five-year plan was completed and exceeded in the spring of 1930, so the agricultural development plan must be fundamentally revised and its tasks re-determined. What are these new tasks? First, the consolidation of industrial agricultural products; second, the reconstruction of animal husbandry and the solution of the meat supply problem; third, the final solution of the grain production problem. This chapter describes these new tasks in five sections: animal husbandry, feed, grain consumption areas, wheat production areas, cotton, and flax. They are bravely advancing under the guidance of the party's general policy, based on the experience gained by the excellent vanguards and organizers of hundreds of thousands of large-scale farms, the collective farm members. "In the coming years, they will not only be able to completely solve the problem of food supply difficulties caused by low-productivity small-scale farms, but they believe that in a very short historical period, they will be able to meet the requirements of the Soviet Union's working masses at a rate of progress never known in capitalist society." The fourth chapter describes the organizational methods that the Soviet Union must have to consolidate and develop collective farms. In the Soviet Union, the rich peasants opposed the collective farms, and the middle peasants were wavering. How to make the general farmers participate in the collective farms and eliminate their reactionary forces is something that the Soviet Union is strictly planning. How they are planning is described in detail in this chapter. They firmly believe that no matter what difficulties stand in front of them, with the existing foundation of the Soviet Union, they will eventually be able to thoroughly achieve collectivization. Yakolev said: "We have these experiences behind us, and we stand on the basis of the party's general policy. We can boldly state that we must correct everything, no matter when, no matter who made the mistake. We will not allow anyone to hinder our collectivization from reaching its final goal, which is the creation of a socialist society!" The fifth chapter is a conclusion, which is a comprehensive explanation by Yakolev after the delegates discussed his report, and answers several questions. Finally, he said: "In short, our conclusion is based on the collectivization movement and state-owned farms. We can undoubtedly catch up with other countries more quickly than before." Indeed, looking at the past achievements of the Soviet Union's five-year agricultural plan, no one would say that his words are an exaggeration. Five appendices are attached at the end: 1. The Actual Record of Agricultural Collectivization in the First Five-Year Plan; 2. The Mechanization of Agriculture in the Soviet Union; 3. On Rural Work; 4. The Sorrow of American Farmers; 5. Collective Farm Movement and Agricultural Improvement. All are invaluable important reference materials, which can be mutually enlightening. At present, rural areas in all countries are suffering from extreme panic, especially in my country, where rural areas are under the oppression of foreign capitalism and are now completely bankrupt. Where exactly is the difference? It is really worth our study. The book can provide us with an important indication for this kind of research. Anyone who is concerned about Soviet agriculture and rural problems in my country must read this book. Eight illustrations are attached at the beginning.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Series</h3>
<h3>Essentials of Aviation in Europe and America</h3>
<p>Compiled and written by Xu Yuanruo, the book has 76 pages, paperback, size 6 open, priced at 25 cents.</p>
<p>In modern warfare, due to the development of aviation, the air force has become a very important element. This book quotes the words of the British Spede, saying that the victory or defeat of future wars will not be determined by trenches or the sea, but by air combat. The importance of the air force in future wars is evident. As long as true world peace is not achieved, the great slaughter of mankind will be inevitable. The great power of the air force in future wars naturally deserves people's attention. Our country's existing naval and land forces are so poor and weak, not to mention the air force. However, the tempest of the times is approaching, and how can we be unprepared for a future world war? For a year, the Japanese air force has attacked our country in various places, and we should have tasted enough of this. What lessons has it given us? The purpose of this book is to introduce the general situation of the air forces of various countries and arouse the attention of the people to the air force. The whole book is divided into two chapters. The first chapter describes the current situation of the aviation circles of European and American powers, and is divided into two parts: military aviation and civil aviation. The United States, France, Britain, Italy, the Soviet Union, and other countries are described separately. From this, we can see how European and American countries, after being taught by the Great War, have drastically expanded their air forces and achieved amazing results in ten years. Not only has military aviation developed particularly, but civil aviation has also made rapid progress with government encouragement and private efforts. The development of civil aviation has an important meaning, that is, in wartime, these civil aviation aircraft can be immediately converted for military use. Therefore, strictly speaking, this kind of civil aviation can also be said to be a part of military aviation, and some countries attach more importance to civil aviation than military aviation, and the significance can be imagined. The second chapter describes the air defense of European and American powers. It is divided into four sections: 1) Air raids and losses of the powers in the European War, 2) European air defense before and during the war, 3) The current situation of air defense facilities of European and American powers, and 4) Civil air defense facilities of the powers. From this, we can know how particularly important a country's air defense equipment is, especially in wartime. If "a country is suffering from air raids by enemy planes, but it does not have its own planes to fight, then the country can immediately turn into ruins within a few hours." This does not need to be proven in books. The bombing of Zhabei by Japanese planes on January 28 is the best practical proof. This chapter describes the facts that European and American powers were threatened by enemy planes due to inadequate air defense equipment during the Great War and the current situation of air defense equipment. The whole book is very concise in describing the current situation of aviation in European and American powers, and it repeatedly emphasizes the importance of aviation. In fact, in today's world, "without an air force, there is no national defense," then how should the people feel after reading this?</p>

<p>Fujian Department of Education Rectification</p>
<h3>Steps and Plans for Vocational Education</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou Correspondent) Zheng Zhenwen, Director of the Fujian Department of Education, believes that vocational education is extremely important and should be sorted out and the steps and implementation plans should be determined. The following is a reference:</p>
<p>There are a total of sixteen vocational schools in this province, public and private. Six of them belong to the province: Fuzhou Vocational Middle School, Fuzhou Polytechnic Middle School, Fuzhou Agricultural and Forestry Middle School, Longxi Vocational Middle School, Nanping Vocational Middle School, and Xiamen Vocational Middle School. Five of them belong to the county: Minhou Vocational Middle School, Minhou No. 1 Girls' Vocational Middle School, Minhou No. 2 Girls' Vocational Middle School, Nan'an Vocational School, and Minqing Xidong Girls' Middle School. Five of them are private: Jimei Commercial School, Jimei Agricultural and Forestry School, Jimei Fisheries and Navigation School, Rantian Vocational Middle School, and Siming Minnan Vocational Middle School.</p>
<p>In the future, funds will be raised and equipment will be expanded. The funds for vocational schools in the province will be allocated from the provincial education funds. The funds for vocational schools in the county will be allocated from the county education funds. The funds for private schools will be allocated from donations from the school board, or from the interest of the school fund and the collection of tuition fees. In the future, the province plans to increase the funding year by year so that the funds for vocational schools account for 5% to 25% of the provincial education funds. At the same time, it plans to cooperate with the provincial construction and construction committee and various industrial groups to invest and cooperate in holding various production-oriented vocational training. The county and private schools are also instructed to raise funds to enrich the equipment, or find ways to sell their products, which can be used for considerable subsidies.</p>
<p>The steps for adding schools are based on the principle of whether education funds can be increased year by year. Judging from the current situation of various vocational schools, the number of secondary vocational schools is actually the majority. In the future, while focusing on the promotion of ordinary vocational training, the vocational training classes of various vocational schools will be expanded to achieve the popularization of vocational education. At the same time, it is planned to add specialized vocational schools to provide further education for vocational school students and reserve teachers for advanced vocational schools. Therefore, it is decided to plan to add an agricultural and forestry specialty school starting in the 22nd year, so that it can be more profound and practical. Starting in the 24th year, it is planned to add a medical specialty school to prepare for the province's medical talent reserve. Starting in the 26th year, it is planned to add an industrial specialty school to meet the needs of the province's industry.</p>
<p>The plan to reorganize the original vocational schools 1) Avoid duplication of courses. Vocational schools in the same area with the same courses will be ordered to merge or change to other courses that meet the needs. 2) Reorganize the establishment of various schools. The junior high school classes that also handle ordinary courses in vocational schools will be ordered to stop or transfer to the middle school for management. All vocational schools will open up vocational classes. 3) Enrich the number of students. While defining the methods for vocational schools to collect various fees, a method for subsidizing students' work and labor achievements will be formulated. 4) Open up student employment opportunities. Within the 22nd year, the purpose of setting up departments in various schools will be specially defined. Vocational skills that are used for appreciation or leisure classes will be gradually enrolled, and talents needed in local agricultural production and manufacturing or in the province's construction plan will be given priority to training. In the future, when short-term primary school children are employed, vocational schools will hold various apprentice classes, and the teachers will be vocational school graduates. It is also planned to jointly set up a general sales office for the products of various schools in the provincial capital or larger cities in the province, and attach a vocational guidance center to promote the guidance of local industries and the introduction of graduates.</p>

<h3>Jinan University Enrolls New Students for the Next Semester</h3>

<p>National Jinan University is the only highest institution for cultivating overseas Chinese youths. After the war, President Zheng actively improved it and restored its old appearance. Recently, he spent half a year rigorously reviewing the articles of association in order to meet the actual needs and emphasize the education of science and production. The newly revised curriculum has been compiled and will be implemented starting in the 22nd year. In recent years, in order to facilitate the enrollment of overseas Chinese children, the enrollment dates are later than other schools. Now, in order to improve the enrollment level of new students, this year's enrollment will be held in July. The registration and guarantee dates are set from July 23rd to 25th, and the examination dates are set from July 28th to 29th.

<h3>Issue of Venue Reclamation by the Athletic Association</h3>
<p>Talks with Shen Siliang</p>
<p>The Association Has Not Yet Received Formal Notification</p>
<p>Even if Reclaimed, It Won't Cause Problems for the Association</p>
<p>For Shanghai's Sake, a Sports Field Should Be Found</p>
<p>The matter of the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation's venue on Route Pére Robert in this city being reclaimed by the landowner, the Rockefeller Foundation, and donated to the National Medical College has drawn much attention from the sports community. Yesterday, the reporter visited Shen Siliang, the honorary director of the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation, to inquire about the truth of the venue situation and future plans. A detailed record is provided below.</p>
<h3>No Notification Yet</h3>
<p>The Rockefeller Foundation Wants to Reclaim the Venue</p>
<p>And Donate it to the National Medical College</p>
<p>The matter has already been seen in the newspapers, but the Athletic Federation has not yet received a formal notification. As for the construction of the hospital, this is a major undertaking and cannot be accomplished in a short period of time. Therefore, even if the venue is reclaimed, it can still be temporarily borrowed. There should be no problem for this winter's soccer season.</p>
<h3>History of Venue Reclamation</h3>
<p>The soccer field, track and field, basketball court,</p>
<p>And tennis court were initially managed by Gray (the sports director of the National YMCA), the Chinese Commissioner and Director-General of the Far Eastern Games, with the remaining funds from the fifth Far Eastern Games. The baseball field was operated privately by Grew and Biers, incurring a loss of over ten thousand yuan. When the Athletic Federation took it back, it received assistance from Cheng Yize. Therefore, Cheng's contribution was significant in the recovery of the baseball field. The several acres of vacant land behind the soccer field had long been sold to the French Municipal Council by the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Huatong Public School has now been built and opened.</p>

<h3>The Newlyweds Lin Liang Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Staying at the Cangzhou Hotel, a Banquet for Friends and Relatives Last Night</p>
<p>Scheduled to Depart for Sichuan on a Honeymoon Trip on the 26th</p>
<p>Tennis national player Mr. Lin Huajun and tennis flower Ms. Liang Peiyu held their wedding on Saturday, the 10th of this month, in Tianjin. The union of these heroes and beauties is a wonderful story in the history of Chinese sports. The newlyweds Lin and Liang arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday afternoon and were warmly welcomed by friends and relatives. The newlyweds are staying at the Cangzhou Hotel and plan to travel to Sichuan for their honeymoon on the 26th of this month.</p>
<p>From Love to Marriage Ms. Liang, accompanied by her sister Ms. Peiyao, represented Tianjin at the National Games in Hangzhou in the spring of the 19th year, winning a championship and gaining fame throughout the country. After returning to Shanghai from Hangzhou, she stayed briefly in Shanghai due to illness, where she met Mr. Lin. From then on, their relationship blossomed on the tennis court and grew stronger over time, leading to their engagement. However, it was never announced until three weeks ago when they officially announced their engagement in Tianjin. Due to the current situation, they advanced the wedding date. The British Consulate Served as the Witness The wedding ceremony was held at the British Consulate in Tianjin at 11 AM on Saturday, witnessed by the British Consul in Tianjin. Chinese and foreign guests were present, making it a grand occasion. Ms. Liang's father, Liang Yanqing, is a prominent Cantonese merchant in Tianjin, and her brother is a compradore at Jardine Matheson, with extensive social connections.</p>
<p>Honeymooning in Sichuan After the wedding, they took a fast train south that evening, arriving at the Shanghai North Railway Station at 5 PM yesterday, and went to the Cangzhou Hotel to rest. Last night, friends and relatives in Shanghai hosted a banquet to congratulate them. The newlyweds will travel to Sichuan for their honeymoon on the 26th of this month. The newlyweds' exploration of Sichuan will be exciting, but it is feared that Mr. Lin's skills will not be seen on the tennis court this season. (Photo by Wang Kaifu)</p>
<h3>The Association's Strength Is Insufficient</h3>
<p>The association has already</p>
<p>Exerted a lot of competitive force on this venue</p>
<p>Initially, it made several requests to the Rockefeller Foundation to donate the land, but ultimately it was unsuccessful. This was because there were many people who wanted the land, and many of them were from the medical field. The Rockefeller Foundation also focused on medical endeavors, so the medical community's requests had a greater effect. This is why the National Medical College was successful. Another factor is that the land tax of the French Municipal Council has increased sharply in recent years. Initially, the entire land only required two hundred taels per month, but now it requires two thousand taels, an increase of tenfold. Therefore, even if the land is not reclaimed, the association would not have the financial resources to pay the land tax.</p>
<h3>It's Not a Problem for the Association</h3>
<p>After the land is reclaimed, there will be no</p>
<p>problems on the association's side. The association is a national amateur sports administrative organization, and it only needs to establish an office. There is no need for the establishment of a sports field. However, for the sake of the entire Shanghai sports community, a sports field must be found. The association's board of directors and enthusiastic sports supporters have contacted various parties several times.</p>
<h3>Difficulty in Finding a Venue</h3>
<p>The Shanghai sports community will be greatly affected after the venue is reclaimed. Therefore, a suitable location must be found to develop a sports field. Yangshupu, Xujiahui, and the Jiangwan city center have all been inspected. The land is sufficient for use, but it is either too expensive or the transportation is inconvenient, making them unsuitable. Now, they are looking in the western part of Shanghai (not on Route de Sikawei). Although the location is slightly remote, the transportation is relatively convenient. Among unsatisfactory options, it is relatively suitable. Therefore, the goal for the venue is generally to focus on the western part of Shanghai. Previously, the association favored the former Shanghai Greyhound Racing Stadium, but the land price was too high and could not become a reality.</p>
<h3>The Association's Fundraising Issues</h3>
<p>As for how the association will manage its finances, this is also not a problem. The equipment on the field is no longer valuable. The writing room and basketball room cannot be dismantled because the contract stipulated that any fixed buildings on the field could not be dismantled when the land was reclaimed. Therefore, the association has always been hesitant to invest in construction, fearing that the money would be wasted if the land was reclaimed.</p>
<h3>Future Sports Situation</h3>
<p>Because of this proposed reclamation of the association's land, enthusiastic sports supporters in Shanghai are considering forming a Shanghai Amateur Sports Association to govern the competitive sports in Shanghai. The association greatly hopes this can be realized. In this way, the association would not need to oversee Shanghai's sports affairs and could fully focus on national sports affairs and the promotion of international sports.</p>
<p>A Sports Field Can Be Found in the Xietu Road Area</p>
<h3>An Opinion from an Enthusiastic Sports Supporter</h3>
<p>Shen expressed his opinion on the issue of finding a venue, as mentioned above. Now, an enthusiastic sports supporter says that the reason why the baseball field has flourished to this day is that it is close to Ximen, surrounded by schools, densely populated, and has convenient transportation. Therefore, when looking for a venue, it should be in an area with a large population, such as the Xietu Road area. There is a lot of vacant land, the transportation is convenient, and it is not far from Route Pére Robert, making it very suitable.</p>

<h3>The Youthful White and Blue Team vs. The Old Boys, A 2-2 Draw</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Committee Youthful White and Blue Soccer Team played a friendly match with the Land Bureau Old Boys team yesterday at the Aurora University field. In the first half, the White and Blue team had the advantage of the sun at their backs and played impressively. Cao Zhongjian directed the team effectively, and Xiao Luocheng shone throughout the field, breaking through the virgin goal of the Land Bureau Old Boys. Changing sides to play, their momentum was strong, and another goal seemed imminent. However, good things don't always last. The Old Boys team was awarded a penalty kick, and the Land Bureau captain acted as the executioner, scoring with one shot. Before long, they conceded another goal, and the game ended with a whistle, resulting in a 2-2 draw, much to the delight of both sides. The lineups of both teams are as follows:</p>

<h3>Chinese Wrestling Association Welcomes Chairman</h3>
<p>The Chinese Wrestling Association was organized by Chen Fengming, Yang Xiaowen, Hu Zhuoru, Zhu Wenwei, Zhang Huichuan, Wang Huaiting, and other disciples of the famous martial artist Tong Zhongyi. The association is located at No. 23, Lane 124, Tongfu Road, at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road, and its purpose is to promote the national art of wrestling. In order to develop its affairs, the association has hired Tong as the chairman and Fan Chongshi, Liu Xiang's representative in Shanghai, as the vice chairman. Tong is currently the director of the Shaolin branch of the Shanghai Municipal Guoshu (National Martial Arts) Hall and is also proficient in wrestling, making him a famous martial artist in our country. Fan has always loved martial arts and also has a deep understanding of wrestling. The association is fortunate to have these two gentlemen serve as chairman and vice chairman. It is reported that a banquet was held at the Zhimelou Restaurant at 7 PM last night to welcome the chairman and vice chairman.</p>

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Lin Pengxia and Shi Tiansun</h3>
<p>— Zhan Kang</p>
<p>China's first female pilot, Ms. Lin Pengxia, came alone from the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Suiyuan, and Chahar, talking extensively about her experiences returning from the Northwest. For a time, people in academic circles highly praised her, calling her China's amazing woman. When I read this in the newspaper, I felt both joy and sadness about the phrase "China's first female pilot." I was happy that there was a woman like Ms. Lin who, with a spirit of great fearlessness, was opening a new era for female pilots. I was sad that in this world where air forces are increasing year after year, China has long claimed to have female pilots, but why is it that only today do we have this "China's first female pilot" Ms. Lin Pengxia?</p>
<p>Back in the yearnings of sixteen years ago, when the European War had not yet ended, the American pilot Ms. Shi Tiansun came to Jiangwan, Shanghai, to demonstrate flying an airplane, receiving a grand welcome from the people of Shanghai. If the women of our country had all worked hard together at that time, would we have had to wait for Ms. Lin to be the trailblazer after such a long period of sixteen years? Female pilots would have emerged one after another long ago. Sixteen years ago, I jokingly drafted a "Message Welcoming Female Pilot Shi Tiansun on Behalf of the Female Community," At that time, humorous articles focused on parallelism and antithesis, and the original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"With lofty ambitions reaching the clouds, and a heart longing to chase lightning; she is not Chang'e, the goddess who flies to the moon, but like a heavenly maiden scattering flowers. Transcending the mundane, she is filled with admiration for the beauty of the West, flying in the clouds, she actually becomes a true person in the sky. Standing behind a screen, walking on a perfuming burner, is not enough to describe her agility; magpies forming a bridge, Qingdao as an envoy, have already yielded to her supernatural powers. Coming down from the sky, Sima Guang's analogy of taking a high official's cap is just empty words; riding the wind in the cold, Lie Yukou's fable actually becomes reality." "Excerpted" We, who are confined to the boudoir, yearn for the blue sky; even if we have the telepathic heart of a rhinoceros horn, we regret not having the wings of a pair of colorful phoenixes; since we are not willing to remain submissive, we are bound to strive to fly high. Those who soar three thousand miles high, the pilots who are high above, can be said to be very far away; those who knock on the eight or nine layers of heaven, we, the mediocre and incapable sisters, do not know how to encourage ourselves?</p>
<p>The final couplet was to encourage the general female community, teaching them to rise up in response and become comparable to Shi Tiansun, but only Lin Pengxia has done so. My fictitious welcoming text can of course be transferred to Ms. Lin. However, after this long period of time, the possibility of transferring it to China's first female pilot has only now arisen, something I never dreamed of when I wrote it back then.</p>
<h3>Cholera Comes to Market</h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>After the loquats turn yellow, the green plums also ripen. The weather gets hotter day by day, and then "cholera" comes to market. "Cholera" does not seek to improve itself. The more high-class the family, the more "cholera" keeps its distance. The more "common" people become, the worse things get, and as they become "poor," "cholera" becomes more intimate with them.</p>
<p>Brother Fly is "cholera's" "volunteer travel agency." Through the power of the "volunteer travel agency," he roams between "weird, weird, ten coppers a cup" of "Dutch-made Holland water," "sweet honey, ten coppers a slice" of watermelon, "white sugar London cake," and "cool chestnut cake." Cold noodle stalls, sour plum soup, and all kinds of sour, spoiled, and rotten "delicacies" are all "cholera's" "summer retreats," for everything that Brother Fly relies upon to live. Common people and poor people, ambitious, swallow cholera's "summer resorts" in one gulp, clearly "pulling the tiger's whiskers," "offending the tiger's might," "stirring up trouble on the god of the year," "cholera" will not give up and will rummage around in your stomach like Sun Wukong, pulling your collar and dragging you to King Yama's court to file a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Of course, the best way to avoid being disturbed by "cholera" is to stay away from its "summer resorts," and on the other hand, get a "vaccination" first to implement "internal security." If you are not careful and "cholera" has already attacked your "hinterland," then you should quickly retreat to the epidemic hospital for "long-term resistance" and never be tough, lest you become "cholera's" captive. Some people like to ask barbers to scrape sha, which is like using a breech-loading gun to resist a machine gun, and "cholera" will laugh so hard it howls.</p>
<p>"Cholera" has come to market, everyone must be careful of fire, and issue a curfew order. Get a "vaccination" to implement "internal security" to prevent "internal reaction." At the same time, when dealing with "imported goods," you must carefully consider and check them before passing them. If Brother Fly arrives uninvited, issue an eviction order, or even take "decisive action," which is the fundamental way to "ban cholera." Please, citizens, "unite spiritually" and "defeat cholera!"</p>

<h3>Four Company Commanders of Northeast China</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Is There a Reason for Jesting? The Son-in-Law Secretly Introduces Her</p>
<p>Why Did This Guest Come So Suddenly? The Western Teacher Leisurely Plots</p>
<p>Huang Manying's stay at the Yang's house for this one night gave the Jiang mother and daughter quite the jolt. Mrs. Jiang naturally stood on the side of supporting the matter of the woman. Even Guizhi herself was thinking that soldiers were not necessarily as bad as they thought of them to be. Look at Company Commander Tian, who Miss Huang was marrying, wasn't he also someone who had emerged from being a student? Although Company Commander Tang wasn't as lively and young as Company Commander Tian, he was honest and had a good number of desirable traits. Reflecting on the situation of Gan Jizhi through the lens of Zhao, that man was refined, and his appearance was quite handsome, but if you listened to what he was saying, the words did not line up as they should, wanting nothing more than to become an official and strike it rich, and would abandon all else, so, taking this into consideration, Zhao was actually the better of the two. Having this shift in perspective, when Miss Huang had asked Guizhi about it, the young woman found herself at a loss and unable to reply. After having eaten dinner, Mrs. Jiang quietly rented two Sanxin cotton quilts from the street to bring back, laying them on the other side of the kang bed, carefully preparing these two to be laid out to sleep on, yet putting the woman's own bedding on the opposite side, leaving a very large gap between them. Mrs. Jiang smiled at Manying and said, "We wouldn't dare to say that the rented quilts are clean. We'll have my daughter and I sleep here. Our own bedding was washed for the New Year, so you can rest assured as you sleep on it." As she spoke, she pointed with her hand in the direction of the kang bed. Manying let out a sound, "Ah-yo! Your treatment of me like this makes me so uneasy. Please arrange the bedding together. That way, I can also lie down with your eldest daughter and have a chat." Mrs. Jiang said with a smile, "We won't! You're a person who's gotten used to sleeping in an iron bed in the city, and now you're forced to sleep on an earthen kang bed after coming to our place. That's already putting you in a situation of discomfort, so how could we make it any worse?" Seeing that she was still being so courteous, the visitor took the initiative to walk forward and join the bedding together, clapping at the cotton quilts with her hand a few times, and said with a smile, "This is good! Let's sleep together along the way." As she spoke, she reached out to pull Guizhi's sleeve. Guizhi said with a smile, "You must be awfully uncomfortable at our place here, and now we want to squeeze you!" Manying said with a smile, "For you mother and daughter to say something like this, it's as if I'm the eldest miss. Eldest daughter, why don't you lie down, and that way, we can chat about whatever we want." The Jiang mother and daughter also felt that she had a very easy-going personality and could not refuse what she meant to do. So, Guizhi and Manying lay side by side along the kang bed, and Mrs. Jiang slept on the outside of Guizhi. Because Guizhi thought of Manying as a visitor coming from the city, she was afraid that she would be unhappy to sleep in the dark, so they did not extinguish the lamp. As the two of them struggled to keep their eyes open while lying on one end of the bed, there was no way to avoid speaking. (98)</p>
<h3>From Gold to Love</h3>
<p>— Ding Ming</p>
<p>While the hardness of gold may not match silver, it surpasses that of tin, ultimately making it the most precious of all metals. From this universally welcomed substance,</p>
<p>I perceive the entirety of love!</p>
<p>Gold's primary source is native gold, followed by gold-bearing pyrite, while telluride gold occurrences are quite limited. Similarly, in human relationships, love—natural love—is paramount, followed by love with some underlying motive, while love born from opposition and discord is exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>Gold's yellow, finely divided forms can transform into purple, red, dark brown, or black. It exhibits a yellow streak and is highly ductile and malleable. Thus, its uses extend beyond coinage, gold leaf production, fine wire drawing, and ornamentation to include the production of photographic chemicals and pigments for the glass and ceramics industries. This mirrors the intangible hues of love, beginning subtly with hints of pale blue, pale yellow, pale red, gradually evolving into rose, or pure white. Its capacity for diverse hues, coupled with its ductility and malleability, enables the other party's temperament, actions, learning, and instincts to be vividly and thoroughly colored. Eventually, this progresses to the white-hot phase of marriage.</p>
<p>Globally, gold's primary sources are the United States and Australia. In China, the now-lost Rehe province leads, with locations such as Sanchakou, Luanping, Badaohe, and Chaoyang. Liaoning follows, with Hailong Xiangluyingzi and others; Jilin, with Yanji Boge Yazijie and others; and Heilongjiang, with Jilalin Alaya Mohe, Kumar, and Wutonghe. Placer gold is also found along the banks of the Heilongjiang River and its tributaries. In Jilin, it's distributed across the Songhua River, Mudanjiang River, Ussuri River, and Suifen River basins. In Liaoning, it's found in the Liao River, Dayang River, and Ai River basins. Current territories of Hebei, Shandong, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Fujian, Sichuan, Xikang, Tibet, (?), Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces are all gold-producing regions. People's golden love starts from a smile? A question and an answer? A needle and a thread? A dish and a meal? A walk and a run? A shy blush and a burst of anger? A lament and a sob? A hum and a coo? A listening and a reading? A reach and a touch? ·······?</p>
<p>Or starts with a flick of clothing? Straightening a hat and combing hair? Riding horses and fencing? Playing soccer and swimming? Under the lamps and moonlight? In flower clusters and willow shadows? In mountain, water, pavilion and tower? Grinding and polishing? In the entertainment ground? In times of trouble? ······</p>
<p>However, one day gold may be worthless, and one day no one will speak of love. Isn't that the case in the primordial era of the opening of the universe?</p>
<p>Correction ·· The "lifting" character in the previous "Epidemic Two Documents Picking Up Tour Towns" was mistakenly written as the "inviting" character, and the "Five" character of the Wuzhou Pharmacy was mistakenly written as the "Asia" character. This is hereby corrected.</p>

<h3>The Bitter Wine of Love</h3>
<p>— Zha Wei</p>
<p>Love is a path that young men and women inevitably embark upon. But upon reflection, the taste of love is not always sweet; often, many people find the suffering felt during passionate love more profound and more cruel than the pain of unrequited love. Ms. Ai Xia is a woman of the times and a glittering star. Her writing is also clear and insightful. Recently, we have often seen her writings on love in newspapers and periodicals, which are incisive and insightful and are indeed the experiences of someone who has been through it. She has also written a screenplay, in which she plays the main character, which has now been filmed by the Star Film Company. The film is titled "A Modern Woman". The narrative of the story strikes a heavy blow to the young people who are immersed in the dream of love. In "A Modern Woman", she points out that love is a pointless deception, a hypocrisy, and that love is built on money. Young people with ambition should strive for their own future and not wander on the wrong path of love. Because love is only a small part of life!</p>
<p>"A Modern Woman" has been released in major cinemas in this city. This is a bitter wine of love, and I think young men and women should all be willing to taste it.</p>
<h3>Who is Doing Art for Art's Sake?</h3>
<p>— Liu Si</p>
<p>I believe that every member of the art world, whether in a grand gathering or in a casual conversation with two or three friends, if someone asks him, "Why are you doing art?" he will answer with particular solemnity: "I am doing art for art's sake"!</p>
<p>At the same time, I firmly believe that, in the art world, those who truly do art for art's sake are no more than one or two percent, and perhaps even that one or two percent should be discounted! The remaining 98 or 99 percent are doing art for a living and for money!</p>
<p>Is Ms. Hu Die, a film star who is good at singing and dancing, doing art for art's sake or for a living and for money? I dare not assert. But looking at the two songs about international society that she has recently sung, which others dare not and cannot sing, we can see that although she has not left the realm of doing art for a living and for money, we should at least admit that she is half doing art for art's sake.</p>
<p>Her songs are:</p>
<p>㈠ Don't you see "Green wine green, red lights red, jazz like a tide, youth like a dream, slender waist, outstretched wrist, like the willow in the wind. Don't you see... Dear sir! The entire northeast territory is lost! The blood of soldiers is still spilled on Shanghai Wusong!"</p>
<p>㈡ The last sound: "Dear sir, thank you for your kindness, forgive my restless heart, my restless mind, this is my last sound; you face this green wine and red lights, and think of the grievances and sorrows of the ghosts in the northeast! Don't wait until the country is broken and hatred lasts forever, sir, tonight's red mansion dream is not yet awake, look at the world boiling! Prepare, charge into the enemy's battle, I can no longer sink into dancing with you! Goodbye, my sir, we must have war! Liberate us in war! Fight to stain the earth with fresh blood, for the nation to fight for the last light!"</p>
<p>Singing such tragic and encouraging words to encourage the people to resist the enemy and save the country has indeed broken the new record of songs. Miss Hu's thoughts and insights are indeed superior to others!</p>
<p>These songs were recorded by the Baidai Company. When the record was being made, the manager of their company specially invited some friends who loved art to come and visit. I was one of the invitees, so I discovered two characteristics of Hu Die's singing of these songs:</p>
<p>㈠ Hu Die's voice is originally clear and crisp and can be high and low, strong and soft; on this day, when she sang, I felt that it was even more desolate and full of flavor, probably because of "concentrating her mind".</p>
<p>㈡ These two songs both use Western music to play Chinese opera tunes! Don't you see that "Nan Bangzi" uses the "Jazz Waltz" beat, and the last sound is "Er Liu", which uses the Fox-trot dance music. When Hu Die sings, she can fit the music everywhere, and at the same time, she can maintain the essence of Peking opera, which is indeed particularly "rare and valuable".</p>

<h3>Respectful Thanks for Development</h3>
<p>— Zheng Boqi</p>
<p>Ever since the friendly friends from the East brought giant cannons from the Northeast, we Chinese have had two great inventions... One is "Long-term Resistance", which has long been world-renowned, and we won't talk about it. The other is "Development of the Northwest", which even most Chinese people have not yet understood. Because of my hometown relationship, I know a little more, so I can't help but publicize it to everyone.</p>
<p>You see, since September 18th, haven't we added two capital cities? Chang'an, which has been dead for thousands of years, has also become a secondary capital. Since then, the call for "Development of the Northwest" has been as loud as the sound of cannons from the Northeast.</p>
<p>Many important people go to the Northwest, industrial survey teams go to the Northwest, journalists go to the Northwest, and even the Shanghai playboys who have always regarded the Northwest as the African desert are clamoring to go to the Northwest. In ancient times, Confucius went west but did not enter Qin. The modern figures of the 20th century have made great progress after all.</p>
<p>Under such vigorous promotion, if the Northwest is still plagued by war and famine, then the Northwest is really content to lag behind. Sure enough, according to old hometown folks who have recently come from there, the situation in the Northwest is indeed different from before. Gold has almost disappeared from the market, and even the Qin bricks and Han tiles excavated from the countryside have greatly increased in price. The Chinese banknotes there have a very great "development" effect. Where has the gold that has been hidden in cellars for hundreds of years gone? It is now probably studying abroad in the basement of the New York Bank. As for the Qin bricks and Han tiles, although they cannot go east to Fusang to taste the flavor of the Imperial Museum for the time being, they can at least see the bright electric lights and the towering foreign buildings on the Shanghai Bund. This is of course something that they are happy about, as they have never seen the world.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are also extremely fragrant stories here.</p>
<p>It is said that a certain noble lady once took a plane from the duty station of her husband in a certain northwest province to Beijing, and the airline had to weigh her weight as usual. Perhaps this company is a "Citibank" brand, so even the noble lady could not express her anger and had to bow her head and let people weigh her. Unexpectedly, it was okay if she didn't weigh, but once she weighed, the petite and exquisite lady, who could dance on her palm, actually weighed one hundred and eighty pounds. Perhaps you will suspect that she has a little treasure in her belly, but her belly is not big, but her waist is a little thicker. What is strange is that after she returned to the south, the price of gold in Shanghai changed.</p>
<p>Therefore, many of my hometown folks are afraid of the slogan "Development of the Northwest". They feel that it is better not to develop, and once developed, both gold and rubble will have a share in going abroad, which is really something they dare not accept.</p>
<h3>Regarding "Three-Story Building" and "Antiques" Reply to Mr. Da Wu</h3>
<p>— Hu Qiuyuan</p>
<p>I just saw Mr. Da Wu's question about the translation of my humble work in Free Talk, and I was surprised and grateful. Although I am quite cautious when translating books, there are really many omissions. After that book by Iko 維持 was translated into Japanese, my friend Mr. Fang Tianbai and I translated it together. At that time, I also got a copy of the original text, but we only knew a few words of French, so in addition to adding people's names and book names, we only checked the original text in detail when we encountered places where the Japanese translation was too difficult to understand. For example, I carefully reviewed the "Egyptian beans" in the article on creation organization. After the book was translated, it could not be sold, and then several translations came out, and the original manuscript became useless. After writing the art theory, I submitted one of the articles as an appendix, but I did not go to look at it in detail. I admit that the translation of the "Three-Story Building" passage is wrong and is a mistake. The Japanese translation is completely consistent with Mr. Dai Wangshu's translation. The Japanese translation has large characters, "which unfolds in three stages." Japanese characters and Chinese characters are the same, I would not fail to recognize the three characters "three stages." But I overlooked it at the time and dropped the character "stage," so it became "three levels." "Three levels" is the Japanese meaning of "three-story building." So the mistake came from seeing "three stages" as "three levels." However, it is true that a miss of a hair's breadth results in an error of a thousand miles.</p>
<p>However, regarding the three characters "antiques," Mr. Da Wu need not be so picky. Although the original text is not at hand, Mr. Dai translates it as "long miscellaneous." The Japanese translation is "antiques," and I also use the two characters "antiques," which is correct. When Mr. Da Wu sees the two characters "antiques," he immediately thinks of the "antiques" of Shandong and Henan. In fact, the original meaning of "antiques" is "zero miscellaneous," and food that is cooked in a miscellaneous way is called "antique soup." The ancient objects are called "antiques," which is a later meaning, because the sound of the three characters "ancient bronze" is transferred. Mr. Da Wu thinks that "antiques" must be dug out of the earth, why bother?</p>
<p>There are roughly three sources of translation errors: first, pretending to know what you don't know; second, not checking the dictionary and interpreting the meaning of the words literally; third, misreading or dropping words. Like the last one, I don't think it should be attacked so severely.</p>
<h3>Ode to the City God Temple</h3>
<p>Lin Yizhi</p>
<p>Forty or fifty rickshaws drove westward in a long line from Xiaodongmen. The passengers were all high-nosed, blue-eyed Westerners, said to be some kind of tourists from foreign countries, going to visit the City God Temple. Foreigners are smarter after all. They know that the tall white stone houses along the Bund and the green lights and red buildings on Avenue Joffre are only the skin of Shanghai. To really understand the heart of Shanghai, you have to go to the City God Temple.</p>
<p>The City God Temple is filled with hazy incense smoke. In the hall with yellow walls and carved corners rebuilt with steel bones and cement, the City God Bodhisattva in Song Dynasty costumes sits majestically. However, those who bow down before him are modern ladies with Parisian perfume on their bodies, American leather shoes on their feet, and hairstyles permed in the 1933 style. They really understand the principle of Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning for application. Like the generals who ride in Ford airplanes, they are still wholeheartedly treating the virtuous with courtesy, setting up a stage to recruit heroes from all over the world, and soliciting talents who can fly and walk on walls in order to jointly meet the national crisis. The City God Temple is the most popular entertainment place. Just as the upper-class Chinese in Shanghai have their Mingyuan, Liva, and Dada Village, the lower-class Chinese in Shanghai have their City God Temple. The small books that cost three or five copper coins a piece are full of paintings and words. They all invite chivalrous men and sword immortals who will draw their swords to help when they see injustice on the road. In a society where you can easily be slapped in the face by foreigners, these heroes are of course a great comfort. So, some young shop assistants are determined to go to Mount Emei to cultivate Taoism so that they can come back and take revenge on their masters and teachers, and they can also fight against the Japanese and save the country. Secondly, it costs six copper plates to see the big-headed people, the small-headed people, and the spider spirits. These things are excellent substitutes for people who cannot even afford two dimes to go to the cinema to see Hollywood legs. Like Hollywood legs, they can make people forget the painful reality and get the intoxication of enjoyment.</p>
<p>The City God Temple is also a popular Sincere and Wing On. Most of the people in Shanghai who can only look at the department stores outside the glass cabinets can satisfy their desires in the City God Temple. A glass ring that costs two dimes will also shine brightly. So, although they see diamonds worn on other people's bodies, they can also comfort themselves with glass light and do not have to feel any unfairness towards others.</p>
<p>The City God Temple also replaces the Royal Hotel and Sullivan. It is said that the taste of Changshu fermented rice balls, Nanxiang steamed buns, white sugar lotus root porridge, and gluten and bean curd leaves cannot be found anywhere in the world, but the City God Temple can satisfy you. The dark crowd is filled with dark stalls, and together with the seeds of flies and all kinds of bacteria, they swallow these delicacies into their hungry stomachs, cultivating powerful antitoxins and engaging in long-term resistance to germs. It is said that this is the unique ability of the Chinese nation to continue its race.</p>
<p>If you are interested, go up to Chunfeng Deyilou or Huxinting to drink tea, and you will better understand the greatness of the Chinese national character. Next to the stinking urine place, someone is tasting tea and talking or sitting alone in meditation. In the midst of a noisy crowd and hot sweat, someone is pulling the erhu to play music or blowing the xiao to tell their feelings. Some people face the streets and alleys where pedestrians are mixed, raising their delicate eyes and adjusting their voices, and some people take a few small newspapers and grab some spiced pumpkin seeds and licorice Huang Lian head and send them into their mouths.</p>
<p>Although in the downtown area, it is like being far away from the dust. If you understand the samadhi here, you can be a good citizen of a great Chinese country. But this spirit is said to have a source, which is a lake in the City God Temple. This lake has a Jiuqu Bridge with nine-curved railings. Under the bridge flows mud-like water, which is evaporated by sunlight and emits a dark light, releasing a burst of stench. The Japanese writer Ryunosuke Akutagawa once personally saw someone urinating in this lake. In fact, things that are even more evil than urine are thrown into this lake. But this is a famous scenic spot listed in the Chinese Grand View, (just as the Great Wall, although it is knocked on the finger as the new border of "Emerging Manchuria", is still a Chinese scenic spot under the determination to recover it,) so the turtles living in this lake still believe that they are in a famous scenic spot, swimming leisurely and contentedly. Sometimes, although they raise their heads to breathe on the surface of the water, perhaps they feel that it is too turbid, but after a while, they lower their heads again and enjoy it happily.</p>
<p>This great spirit of the turtle has indeed made a great contribution to the Chinese nation. Therefore, the City God Temple is ultimately a Shanghai public education hall.</p>
<p>No wonder it was burned down once a few years ago, and many gentlemen generously donated money and immediately rebuilt it. No wonder the Westerners who come to Shanghai to visit want to visit the City God Temple first!</p>
<h3>Drought</h3>
<p>— Yi Fei</p>
<p>Wang Lao Si stood on the pond road, staring absently at the pond that had dried up to the bottom, and his own rice fields waiting for rain. He had no choice but to sigh helplessly.</p>
<p>The early summer sun was already scorching hot on his back, causing him to sweat constantly. The high and clear sky showed no sign of rain.</p>
<p>"Yes, the weather has changed. The season has just entered summer, and the sky has been clear for so long!" Wang Lao Si said to himself, pacing back and forth on the pond road.</p>
<p>Indeed, this was something that had never happened in recent years. A drought broke out just when the rice was planted!</p>
<p>—Of course, his own rice fields were too close to the mountains and fields, and the wheat ripened too slowly, so the nearby ponds were dry when it was time to plant the rice. But if it continued to be sunny like this, what would be the use even if it had already been planted? Thinking about it, Wang Lao Si remembered what happened last year:</p>
<p>—Wasn't last year a year of "favorable weather" and "abundant harvests"? However, the cheap price of grain caused him, who had been struggling to survive in the soil all year round, to incur a large debt: He had originally hoped to "recover his capital" this year, but what would be the result this year? Just when he started planting rice, it had been sunny for so long, and a drought had broken out!</p>
<p>—Ah—this year that always makes it difficult for the poor! Is poverty, disease, and hunger really the only reward for us honest and law-abiding farmers? ······</p>
<p>He kept thinking, and sweat filled his whole body in the hot and dry air. He looked up at the sky, and the sky was still high and clear, without any sign of rain.</p>
<h3>Carrot Whiskers</h3>
<p>— Written by Julcs Kenard, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Tadpole</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers was playing alone in the yard. He was standing in the middle of the yard so that the Lepeck family could watch him from the window. He was playing very well when his friend Remy came running over. Remy was a child of the same age as him. Although he was a cripple, he always wanted to run, so his bad left foot often fell behind the other one, never catching up. He was carrying a basket and said:</p>
<p>"Are you coming, Carrot Whiskers? Dad soaked the hemp in the river. Let's go help him and use the basket to catch tadpoles."</p>
<p>"You go ask my mom," Carrot Whiskers said.</p>
<p>Remy—Why should I ask?</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers—Because if I ask, she won't let me.</p>
<p>Just then, the Lepeck family stuck their head out of the window and looked over.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Lepeck, can I take Carrot Whiskers to catch tadpoles?" Remy said.</p>
<p>The Lepeck family put their ears to the glass. Remy called out the words above again. The Lepeck family understood. We saw her moving her lips. The two children didn't hear anything and could only look at each other hesitantly. But the Lepeck family shook their heads at this time, clearly indicating that they would not allow it.</p>
<p>"She doesn't agree," Carrot Whiskers said. "She must have something for me to do right away." Remy—It's a pity, otherwise everyone could have had a good time playing. She doesn't agree, she doesn't agree.</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers—Stay here. Let's play together here.</p>
<p>Remy—Ah! No, who would do that? I would rather go fishing for tadpoles. The weather is very mild. I can catch several baskets full. Carrot Whiskers—Wait a little while. Mom often refuses at first. Sometimes she changes her mind later.</p>
<p>Remy—I'll wait a little while, but not much more.</p>
<p>The two put their hands in their pockets and stood there together, staring intently at the ladder. After a while, Carrot Whiskers pushed Remy with his elbow and said:</p>
<p>"See, what did I tell you?"</p>
<p>Indeed, the door opened, and the Lepeck family was holding a basket prepared for Carrot Whiskers in their hand, and took a step down. But she hesitated and stopped.</p>
<p>"Hey, you're still here, Remy· I thought you were gone. I'll tell your dad later that you're playing wild outside, and he'll scold you."</p>
<p>Remy—Carrot Whiskers asked me to wait for him.</p>
<p>Lepeck family—Ah! Really, Carrot Whiskers?</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers neither admitted nor denied it. He didn't know what to do. He understood the Lepeck family thoroughly, and he guessed her again. But Remy, that stupid thing, had completely ruined the good thing, and Carrot Whiskers didn't care about the ending of this matter. He trampled the grass on the ground with his feet, looking elsewhere.</p>
<p>"But I don't seem to have the habit of changing my mind," the Lepeck family said. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Under High Pressure Selling Pressure</p>
<p>Gold Prices Continue to Fall by Fourteen Yuan</p>
<h3>Economic Conference Not Conducive to the Future of the Gold Market</h3>
<p>The gold market’s decline intensifies, morale is low. Initially, overseas silver markets saw declines in London but rises in the US, with exchange rates continuing to increase. Forward silver prices on the Metal Exchange rose insufficiently. Stocks saw both rises and falls. US cotton and wheat saw slight gains, but not enough to satisfy. As for Britain's plan to use a massive amount of silver from the Indian government to repay war debts, morale has somewhat stabilized. The initial opening price was 97.80 yuan, but later, due to private telegraph reports of silver prices rising to 43.75, exchange rates soared by more than 3%, leading major players to sell off, causing a gradual decline. The morning opening was slightly lower, but then Guangbang suddenly entered the market with advances, and banks also showed strong appetite, causing a temporary rise within the 90 yuan range. However, after entering the market, the situation remained downstream. Guangbang advanced and then retreated. Morale was inherently weak, and both the exchange market and gold market were sluggish, with lower prices expected in the future. Bombay initially rose three annas, then contracted by four annas, once pulling up. The World Economic Conference opens today, and the future is not conducive to the gold market. If it succeeds, gold prices are bound to fall. But if it fails, economic warfare is likely to bring more harm than good. The cooked red price is still increased by 85 yuan. The six-seven month swap discount is 10 yuan and 5 jiao. The day's market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 891.5 yuan, a slight drop of 3 jiao compared to Saturday's noon closing. Spot goods opened at 89 yuan. Fuchang, Wanxing, Zhaofengchang, Dadecheng, Qianchang, and Xiangshunli sold and fell to 87.5 yuan. Banque Belge bought September US dollars at 43.75. Yuansheng, Yonghengxing, Tianfeng, Yongyuanheng, Zhaofengchang, and others rushed to buy advances. Banque Belge and Mitsui bought August at 25. Before long, banks did the same month at 1.875, then rushed to 97.5 yuan. Spot goods reversed and sold off heavily. Silver companies came out with August US dollars at 1.25. Zhifengyong, Qianyu also sold. Yuanmao came in with strong buying, but knowing that HSBC's listing showed London rising 1.25 and the US rising 25, HSBC and Mitsui stuffed September US dollars at 3.75, retreating to 2.5 yuan. But the September 43.75 was bought by banks. Hengxing and Hengxingyuan also paid, reaching 5 yuan. After entering the market, September 43.75 was difficult to sell. Fuchang, Daxing, Yongrenfa, and Yongbingxing sold enthusiastically. Hengxing suddenly divested, and was therefore at 90 yuan. But the Dalian gang, Yuankangxiang, Zhengchang, and Tianfengyong took advantage of the low price to pay advances, with repeated ups and downs. Until Banque Belge came out with September US dollars at 3.75. Hengxing's selling intention was strong, again breaking 90 yuan. Before long, October 68.75 was difficult to sell. Yuanshengyong sold even more, and the decline accelerated. After entering the market, the exchange market was loose and flooded. September US dollars at half a yuan and July at 1.25 both lacked buyers. Zhifengyong sold to 5.5 yuan. Banque Belge bought September US dollars at half a yuan, and was slightly able to rebound. It was as if morale had been exhausted. Although September US dollars at 5.625 was also difficult to sell. Dadecheng, Fuyu, Yuanmao Yong, and others sold off together, falling to 81.5 yuan. An Eastern merchant bought September US dollars at 6.25. In the afternoon, it was 884 yuan. Spot goods were auctioned at the same price. After the market closed, banks continued to stuff and were even lower. The after-market opening fell to 878 yuan. Spot goods opened at 8 yuan and 5 jiao. Zhaofengchang and Yuanheng entered the market. Banque Belge bought September US dollars at 75, rising twice to 80 yuan. This hurdle was difficult to cross, because Fangxingyong, Fuchang and Yuanmao were all selling. By the time September 81.25 was difficult to sell, Yuanxingyong and Tongyi also sold. Bombay telegraphed a rise of eight annas, falling back to three yuan. Banque Belge bought September US dollars at 8.75. Mackenzie bought October US dollars at 1.25. Hengxing, Zhifengyong, Fuyu and Yuanmaoyong bought multiple times, rising again to 9 yuan. But due to Korea coming out with July at 3.75, it still retreated. Banque Belge bought January 68.75, hovering around 6 yuan at this time. Bombay rose again by a large three annas for the second time. Little Luzon telegraphed to sell September US dollars at 8.75. Hengtai sold enthusiastically, falling again to 73 yuan. After entering the market, the situation was stable. Qingfayong advanced to 7 yuan. Chunyuan Yong Tongyi advanced from 5 yuan to 8 yuan. Bombay returned a small three annas. Dalian sought to close September US dollars at 81.25 but did not succeed. Hengxing re-entered, and the situation suddenly tightened, once rising to 80 yuan and 0.5 jiao. Banque Belge came out with September 81.25. Hengtai Fuyu divested. Hengxing also did not supply, retreating again to 5.5 yuan. Scrap increased in price. The closing price was 877 yuan and 8 jiao. After the market closed, Bingxing Fuyu and Yiyu all sold. In the exchange market, near-term US dollars at 31.25 could be closed. It once retreated to within 7 yuan, while spot goods were still auctioned at 7.5 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the day was 897.5 yuan, and the lowest was 873 yuan, with a difference of 4.5 yuan. As a result, it continued to fall 14 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The posted price was due to HSBC's US exchange rate rising by 25, to 0.625 yuan, making the implied gold price over 914 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 36 yuan down, more than 5 yuan higher than the previous Saturday. The registered price for this month is 897 yuan, for July it is 884 yuan. The morning supplemental water was 897 yuan, and the afternoon was 891 yuan. The cooked red price still added 85 yuan. The market still lacked supply. In reality, it needed to be increased by more than 90 yuan. The six-seven month term was entered by Dadecheng at a discount of 10 yuan and 0.5 jiao, so Runchangyu posted 56 bars. There are still 4,879 bars remaining for this month.</p>
<p>Trading in the market is still strong. The entry and exit of various firms are uncertain. Guangbang Hengxing enthusiastically bought first and then sold vigorously later. In summary, Hengxing, Fuchang, Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Yuanxingyong, Hengtai, Renfayong and Fuyu all exited. Shunli, Yuanheng, Tianfengyong, Yuankangxiang, Hengxingyuan, Qingfayong, Yifengyong, etc. all entered. Wanxing, Daxingyong, and Tongyi exited first and then entered. Hengxingyuan and Mao advanced first and then exited. Dalian Bang Shunli squeezed in 182 bars in the morning market. Wanxing exited 49 bars. In the afternoon market, Shunli squeezed out 63 bars. Wanxing entered 42 bars. Guangbang Hengxing entered more than 500 in the morning market and exited more than 1700. In the afternoon market, entry and exit were quite frequent. The total number of chips in July was 22,652 bars.</p>

<p>Yesterday’s interbank lending market saw supply and demand meet, but confidence remained weak, leading to a decline in prices.

<p>The rest all rose by several jiao to more than two yuan</p>
<p>New Highs and Limit-Up Prices Blend Together</p>
<p>The market at the Chinese Securities Exchange was prosperous again yesterday. Because there was hope that Feng Yuxiang's troops would be resolved, and that it would not expand, the Southwest and the Central Government gradually formed a cooperative situation, and people's confidence rose again. The financial community absorbed a lot, especially the whole six public bonds, and there was a lot of demand. The bulls in various groups added positions, and each market rose with joy, increasing by jiao to one yuan three or four jiao. The whole six bonds rose by as much as one yuan and nine jiao. In the secondary market, the northern gang also took in, and the financial community's demand continued to surge. Among them, only the 20th Customs Forward and the Consolidated Tax were slightly lower by two or three jiao. The rest continued to rise by several jiao to more than two yuan. The whole six bonds for this month have risen by more than four yuan, announcing a limit-up. The momentum is extremely beautiful. In the afternoon, due to time constraints, it was changed to one market. At the initial opening, the front listed varieties were slightly lower by one or two jiao to three or four jiao. When entering the 20th year, various groups were still buying more and selling less, and continued to rise. The salt tax rose by as much as eight jiao. The whole six forward bonds continued to rise by four jiao, reaching the limit-up price. However, because someone was selling, it was not a limit-up. The market price, as a result, rose by several jiao to two yuan and several jiao. However, the whole six bonds rose by four yuan and one jiao, and the special ferocity of the rise was really due to chip relations. Disarmament forward bonds reached 63 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen. The salt tax for this month reached 50 yuan and 9 jiao and 5 fen, and the forward bonds reached 50 yuan and 4 jiao. The whole six bonds for this month were 52 yuan and a half, and for July they were 52 yuan and 8 jiao, all of which have broken through the highest market prices of the previous weeks, and established new highs. According to market sentiment, there is still the possibility of continued rise, but the market price is too high and there are also fears of a reaction. One should not be foolish or careless. The total number of transactions was 19,092,000 yuan, including 22,000 yuan for spot goods. Futures consolidated tax accounted for 7,215,000, disarmament accounted for 2,420,000, the 19th Customs accounted for 3,340,000, the 20th accounted for 3,385,000, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to more than 800,000.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Uneven</h3>

<p>30 Industrial Stocks 94.42 Rise 0.13</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 42.98 Fall 0.02</p>

<p>40 Bonds 84.48 Fall 0.16</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Rose and then Fell Sharply</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then fell, and the situation was very weak. The amount of yarn stored in warehouses is increasing day by day. Gold prices have fallen sharply. Foreign cotton has loosened, and morale is increasingly exhausted. As for actual demand, it is still depressed. Various parties' willingness to purchase is quite sluggish, all due to tight credit and a great lack of purchasing power. There is little confidence in the future situation.</p>
<h3>Artificial Cotton Soft and Weak</h3>
<p>The opening of the artificial cotton market in the morning was still tight, with all months rising by more than one yuan. After auctioning two or three rounds, it fell slightly. As a result, all months rose by six, eight, and nine jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that a certain country's yarn had fallen sharply, and the World Economic Conference was feared to be unfavorable to the cotton industry. Therefore, the wind rose again, and there was a lot of closing by those with profits, and each month fell round by round, falling by one yuan, two, three, four, and seven jiao.

<p>Sichuan 20 Luzhou 50 Wuhu 10 Nanjing 20 Mainland 285 Changsha 125 Ningbo 10 Guangdong 30 The cotton market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, but the situation was very violent. The daily rise and fall was between seven or eight jiao and one yuan, which shows that the bulls and bears were both restless. This situation is entirely due to the fanaticism of speculators. In the morning, it rose sharply due to news that Chenhua had squeezed short positions. In the afternoon, it was heard that a certain country's cotton had fallen sharply, and the gold market had fallen sharply. People were panic-stricken, and the market fell.</p>
<h3>Zheng Cotton Fluctuates Irregularly</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Zheng Cotton market in the morning, the atmosphere in the market was greatly boosted, and buying was also strong. Each month rose by five, six, and jiao.

<h3>Foreign Factories Continue to Handle Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>The most common type of current cotton trading continues to be handled by Japanese merchants. The source is Yao Hua 50 packages.

<p>Foodstuffs: Samples of Wheat Arrive From All Directions</p>
<h3>Market for Wheat Flour Falls Step by Step</h3>
<p>This Year's Wheat Products Show Great Improvement Compared to Previous Years</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's flour market initially showed signs of flatness, then fell. Because foreign wheat quotations rebounded by one to four or five jiao, the confidence at the initial opening was still stable, and slightly better than the previous week. However, after entering each market, the weather has turned sunny and smooth. Wheat from all producing areas has been seen in samples. Although the arrival of goods is not smooth, it has already reached Wang Ling. In addition, major manufacturers have successively released their files. Although merchants from the northern route have also taken in, the environment is not good, and it is still falling. Until the opening of the afternoon market, because the weather was still good, the major manufacturers continued to distribute (Fuxin in the morning, Fufeng in the afternoon). On the merchants' side, because the future has little hope, and their courage has been退, and most people are covered by the continued borrowing of US wheat, the purchase has also invisibly decreased. Therefore, the market atmosphere is step by step, and I am afraid that there is no re-emergence in a while. As a result, this month fell by two points compared to the previous week, July fell by two points and two li half, August and September fell by one point, and October and November each fell by one point and two li half.</p>
<p>Wheat: The wheat market yesterday showed a sign of violent fall. Because the weather has turned clear, new wheat samples have been sent from all directions, and the wheat products are greatly improved compared to previous years. Moreover, because the factories still have huge amounts of foreign wheat, the time for the new wheat to be in season, and there will never be as much competition as in previous years. It must be at the time of cheapness before the taste will be moved. Therefore, people's hearts are extremely虚 fatigue, and merchants and customers have seen a smooth exit, and the return of bullishness is also very considerable, so the June and July months have broken the four yuan mark. According to the recent situation, the near-term standard may have to see the low price of eight or nine jiao. As a result, this month still opened at 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 6 fen with no ratio. July fell sharply by eight points compared to the previous week. August fell by nine points, September fell by eight points, October fell by five points, and November fell by eight points. The current wheat arrival is still not smooth. Yesterday, 1,500 packages of Hezhou wheat were opened, priced at 4 yuan, and were handled by Shen Da, Hua Feng, and Fu Feng.</p>
<p>Foreign Ke Xian Sales are Active Again</p>
<h3>Inquiries from Fuzhou, Wenzhou, and Tianjin</h3>
<p>The market for foreign Ke Xian was still active yesterday, because various gangs from this place had inquiries. In addition to the Fuzhou gang continuing to handle smoothly, Wenzhou and Tianjin were also going to the stomach. The Tianjin gang had not inquired for a long time. Yesterday, they handled 500 packages of Hunan machine red rice. If the loading and sales are cost-effective, there may be hope for continued handling. The Wenzhou gang handled 270 packages of Nanjing rice, 283 packages of Nanjing rice, 400 packages of Jiangbei rice, and 700 packages of Wuxi rice. Fuzhou went to Jiangxi for 220 packages of rice and Hunan for 1,850 packages of rice. This gang handled 100 packages of Saigon No. 1. Also, 200 packages of small twisted were handled by Wenzhou. The prices quoted were similar to last week. Only the small twisted rice was one jiao lower than the foreign merchant's selling price last week, but one jiao better than the re-acquired selling price.</p>
<h3>Broad Beans Arrive in a Rush, Seen as Exhausted</h3>
<p>The market for new broad beans has fluctuated recently. There are not many sources of Minhang green broad beans. Sales are available in Guangxia Shantou and this street. As a result, the market is standing up. The most common type of other white broad beans is Jiading goods coming in the most rush. Going to the stomach, there is a foreign village that walks along the road, so it is repairing a small two or three jiao. The small Wenzhou small broad beans have fallen to below the four yuan mark, opening at three yuan and nine jiao. The Ningbo broad beans are temporarily standing up due to the rare arrival. New Zhejiang Yuhang new silkworm, yesterday the first batch arrived at 90 packages and sold for four yuan. Wujiang Qing silkworm arrived at 50 packages and opened at four yuan and five fen.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea: Qimen Tea Shops Stop Making Zi Tea</h3>
<p>Qimen black tea is divided into spring and summer first tea and zi tea. Each company has finished making spring village and is taking care of summer village. The output of zi tea is not as huge as that of the first tea, but it is also not in a small number. This year, spring tea in Qimen and Fu both suffered losses, and prices fell again. Mountain households lost tea and lost prices, hoping that the Shanghai market would improve. Zi tea production was abundant, making up for the previous shortage. Qimen Tea Industry Association received a telegram from the Shanghai Association, saying that foreign merchants were trying to depreciate tea prices and sales were narrow. Please stop making zi tea to avoid losses. Therefore, all tea companies that had finished making first tea and planned to make zi village ended there and did not add any more. Mountain households who are about to open gardens to pick and make zi tea all feel deeply that it is difficult to support their lives.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Changjiang Gang Procures Guanghua Mian Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Changxing Bank opened RA cotton Holland white at 21 yuan and 2 jiao, Guanghua Factory Lu character at 20 yuan and 4 jiao, Shou character at 20 yuan, and Quan character at 19 yuan and 6 jiao. Ground sand plus Guangdong bag at 20 yuan and 6 jiao. The recently produced Lu, Shou, and Quan three cotton sugar are fresh, oily, and comparable to Taikoo sugar. Each file is reduced by four jiao, and it is quite popular among采. Because the factory's sugar exports are exempt from earth tax, the Changjiang Gang also equipped a lot.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Ramie Rubber Cloth Sells Well in Western Clothing Gangs</h3>
<p>Ramie rubber cloth has been popular for many years, but sales have not been very strong. Since last year, sales have gradually improved. This summer's market sales are even better. Those who add Western Xia costumes all choose this material, especially the Western clothing gangs in this street have a particularly healthy taste. Three-port ramie rubber cloth and gray crepe ramie rubber cloth are the best sellers. Single-width yellow ramie rubber cloth at 1 yuan and 8 or 9 jiao and fair-width sesame ramie rubber cloth, etc., also sell well. However, there are many people who are making custom orders this year, so there is a sufficient supply of goods, and it is difficult to increase the selling price.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<h3>Spot Nail Transactions at This Factory are Few</h3>
<p>Since the local nail factory has sprung up vigorously, shipments have been rapid and sales are low. French and Western nails have disappeared from this port. No less than a dozen local nail factories have been established. The daily city shipments total 5,000 to 6,000 barrels. Recently, the season has entered the mold season, and most of the actual selling users have stopped operations, so there are few transactions. The market price is quite low due to competition among factories. Each barrel is estimated at 7 yuan and 3 jiao, and Bessie is two jiao smaller than before, but the actual transaction still does not see any improvement. The prices of each stall are described below:</p>
<p>Product/Type Price Per Barrel Product/Type Price Per Barrel</p>
<p>1 inch 10.30 2.5 inches 8.00</p>
<p>1.25 inches 9.80 2.75 inches 8.00</p>
<p>1.5 inches 8.90 3 inches 7.90</p>
<p>1.75 inches 8.70 3.5 inches 7.90</p>
<p>2 inches 8.30 4 inches 7.80</p>
<p>2.25 inches 8.30 4.5 inches 7.60</p>

<p>Conversation</p>
<h3>Small-Mindedness</h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>Recently, I've been a bit paranoid, constantly thinking with unease, "It's coming," "This time it's really coming," and I can't be at peace. Although I haven't personally been persecuted in any way, from what I vaguely see around me, I feel that this sense of "it's coming" isn't unfounded. Really, in this abnormal China, it's not easy, it's not easy to make you think positively. In my imagination of the future, the pleasing aspects are far fewer than the frightening ones. I always feel like it's late in the evening, with twilight attacking from all sides, and a darker situation is about to unfold before my eyes, so I am terrified. It might be a bit "small-minded," but reality forces you not to have any hope. A few days ago, I went to Jiangwan to see an airshow as per a friend's invitation. The pilot's smooth and skillful flying really moved me. It is said that the Aviation Association has ordered eighteen fighter planes—I am also one of the two-yuan bosses, but I don't care—I can't manage these idle accounts, but whether or not one is a shareholder or boss, one always has the right to imagine. I thought, if I could fly these eighteen planes to Tokyo and Osaka to retaliate for some of the damage from the Shanghai battle and the grievances of the people of Northeast China, wouldn't that be a satisfying thing? But as soon as I thought that we are "ill-fated Chinese," I immediately stopped the thought, feeling that such an idea was a bit too presumptuous. The era has reached the 20th century, and airplanes should have originally been possessed by civilized countries as embellishments of a prosperous age. But using them to carry important people, or circling the city three times in the air, and spreading it to ordinary wealthy people to broaden their horizons, is also good, right? We also have the opportunity to appreciate them. But now the situation has changed again, and the "it's coming" that I was probably worried about is finally coming. Then, even if you are not very at ease, there is nothing you can do about it. In this turbulent situation, the planes will naturally be put to use. Although it is unknown which way the bombs will fall, it can be asserted that the tails will not point inward. Although hoping for this is "small-minded, judging the heart of a gentleman with one's own," it originally does no harm to the sun and moon. If, unfortunately, it turns out to be true, then it would be an unexpectedly terrible thing.</p>

<h3>Four Rhymes</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>I entered Huaxu and traveled around China, hearing children's rhymes that go like this:</p>
<p>Drawing Promises, Drawing Promises</p>
<p>The world is astonished, Champagne is offered, Loquats have no feet, How can one eat their flesh without peeling the skin?</p>
<p>Children's Rhyme from a Farming Village</p>
<p>Sweet trees have worms, felled by themselves and collapsing, Golden beetles hurt my crops, Countless coming from the west, Who cares about me, Officials in Guangzhou are carefree,</p>
<p>Buying Chicken Rhyme</p>
<p>Buying chickens that don't fly, Thieves are coming with hope, Brothers are there, With thick arms and big fists, Urging eggs,</p>
<p>Good Year Rhyme</p>
<p>In a good year, people suffer from hunger, Or manage their graves, Go out and see farmers dying on the road, Saying the blue sky remains the same,</p>
<h3>Restaurant Xishi</h3>
<p>— Warrior</p>
<p>A Zhen brought the dinner again.</p>
<p>Because of the meal problem, everyone really felt troubled. They paid a high price but couldn't get good food. "Contract meals are not fit for humans!" They often complained about the contract meals.</p>
<p>Because everyone's opinions differed, Zhao Shangyuan and Quan Sheng gathered three or four people and formed a small group, eating at He Xing, a small contract meal place in Lane 33 behind. He Xing is not large. Besides the owner and his wife, there is also the owner's daughter, named A Zhen. There is also a hired hand. Because there are few people, A Zhen always personally delivers the contract meals to the small tables recently. A Zhen is nineteen years old this year. Although she may not necessarily be very delicate, she is slender enough, with a white face, bright and shiny eyes, red lips, and thin eyebrows, all of which show her youthful beauty. Especially her legs and arms are particularly plump and white. The snow-white, thin gauze stockings wrapped her legs tightly, as if they were about to burst. Inside, a faint pink flesh color was revealed, and it seemed as if a scent of meat wafted over with every movement. Several young men in these alleys then jointly gave her the title of "Restaurant Xishi." The young friends in several nearby small shops all wanted to flirt with her, and A Zhen was really unrestrained, never afraid of these young friends' entanglement.</p>
<p>Quan Sheng was also one of those drooling over A Zhen. Now that they had contract meals with He Xing, and it happened to be A Zhen delivering the meals herself, this was naturally a good opportunity for Quan Sheng. Although they had only been eating the contract meals for three to five days, the results of Quan Sheng's advances were not bad.</p>
<p>When eating, Zhao Shangyuan and a few older people were present. Quan Sheng couldn't be too presumptuous. He just secretly glanced at A Zhen with his eyes. A Zhen naturally leaned against the window, watching them eat. She knew that Quan Sheng was peeking at her, and her watery eyes then gave Quan Sheng a slight smile. Quan Sheng couldn't resist A Zhen's gesture, and his heart suddenly pounded, and he felt a whooshing sound in his ears.</p>
<p>Quan Sheng finished his meal quickly. Today, he couldn't endure it any longer. He quickly walked to the corner of the back alley. It happened that there were no electric lights installed here, and the place was very dark, with few people coming and going. In Quan Sheng's view, it was the perfect place to intercept someone. What happens next can only be told after asking Quan Sheng.</p>
<p>Isn't this the special benefit of eating contract meals?</p>
<h3>Little Sanzi's Home</h3>
<p>— Leji</p>
<p>In a certain district north of Shanghai, there is a very large (not a large scale) slum. The houses are made of piles of broken bricks and mud walls, and roofs of mixed grass and reeds. Looking at them from a distance, one would never think that they are places where breathing people live, but rather like tombs where people from another world rest. Eighty or ninety percent of the residents inside are friends who pull rickshaws or wheelbarrows. Our Little Sanzi is one of them. Now I will ask him to come out as a representative to show a glimpse of the living conditions here.</p>
<p>His house is a room of less than two zhang square, and his whole family of five eats, drinks, and sleeps in it. Besides a south-facing door that requires one to bend down to enter, there is also a hole in the north side that is less than a foot in diameter and not quite round. When the door is closed, it can still let in some light. The roof above has long lost its function, only blocking the sun's heat, while wind and rain can freely invade. When it rains, the whole house is always filled with water, and if you are not careful, you will be woken up from a good dream by the rain. Such a place would probably be considered unhygienic even for dogs to come and go, but if they don't live here, where else can they go? Moreover, they are struggling outside all day for a living and have no time to take care of cleaning the house. A table with wobbly legs, two broken bamboo chairs, a cracked jar stove, two uneven beds made of broken wooden planks, and miscellaneous things with no place to be placed. There are also several bowls and plates that have turned black, broken stands, washbasins, and pieces of wood, iron cans, and the like scattered everywhere. The whole house is in a state of chaos, with dirty colors and a moldy smell. You will probably vomit for three days after entering for a minute, but they seem to be used to it and never disgusted. The concept of hygiene is something they don't have.</p>
<p>During the day, the house is always quietly closed because their whole family always sets out early in the morning on a journey for a living and will not return until sunset. He himself pulls a rickshaw, his wife is a seamstress, a daughter helps her mother, and two sons spend all day outside picking up scraps with bamboo baskets on their backs. They are truly self-reliant and a family that cooperates by division of labor. Although each person's face inevitably bears the deep marks of struggling with life, sometimes you can also see his sons each holding a bowl of yellow rice, with a piece of bright red, sauce-like pork on top, eating with a very satisfied smile. This probably indicates that their business has been good these days, or that their sons have picked up something valuable. At this time, their happiness is probably beyond what even princes and grandsons can reach!</p>
<h3>My Enlightenment</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>I remember seeing a "New World Fifty Years Later," where people's names were completely replaced by Signal and other designations. Although it's just imagination, a person's name is ultimately just a symbol. Zhang San and Li Si only make people think of a thin, tall person when Zhang San is mentioned, and a short, fat person when Li Si is mentioned. If someone like Chiang Kai-shek is only referred to as Chairman Chiang, and Zhang Xueliang is called Zhang the Non-Resister, it's because the latter titles are well-known and have almost become their reporters. I never thought that my deceased father's name for me, "Ping," would become fashionable this year. Every magazine, every supplement, has the discovery of the character "Ping," and the "News" supplement even has the same name signed as "Yiping." I don't dare to take credit for others' work, nor am I willing to change the character "Ping" that has accompanied me for twenty-five years. While I was in a dilemma, yesterday (the 9th), an advertisement for "Yiping Jian" was found in the "Shen Bao" again, causing my friends to rush to my little house to ask me what was going on. The newspaper advertised: "Received the letter and rushed over at night, searched everywhere in Hangzhou and Beijing without finding you, returning to Quzhou, I am restless, staying in Hangzhou, my vacation is about to end, if I delay any longer, both public and private matters will be harmed, could this be what you initially expected, fortunately, upon seeing this newspaper, return home immediately," etc. I was afraid that even worse discoveries would be made, so I painfully sacrificed and changed the "Ping" that had accompanied me for twenty-five years to "Pin." Friends, please recognize the trademark so that there is no mistake. (Thank you)</p>
<h3>The Power of Hunger</h3>
<p>— Daren</p>
<p>Hunger truly has an unbelievable and amazing power. Just one day without eating, and your stomach will start to rebel. No matter how strong your will is, it will make you dizzy, your vision blurry, and your limbs weak. You must find something to comfort that empty stomach. At this time, as long as it can comfort and suppress the rebellious stomach, any method or means can be chosen. No matter how strict the law, how thorough the police, or how much morality maintains people's hearts, they all lose their effectiveness in the face of hunger. Law, police, and morality, I feel, are only tools for binding the mediocre people who are well-fed and warmly clothed, and can never bind the hungry masses who devour everything like tigers and wolves. "A gentleman in poverty" is just black words on white paper. In fact, there is no such thing. As long as hunger descends upon him, all those so-called moral, conscientious, and law-abiding people will act against their principles. "When the granaries are full, people know etiquette," and "when people are well-fed and clothed, they know honor and shame." These two sentences are eternal truths. I often hear the cries of "selling children and daughters" and the tragic events of "exchanging children to eat," which are already the most cruel things in the world. But who knew that during the famine in Gansu and Shaanxi two years ago, there were actually people who "cut off their beloved son's thin legs to use as lunch and cut open their beloved wife's nipples to temporarily use as dinner!" Even their beloved wives and children were being cut and opened, and there was no need to mention other laws that were merely empty words and the morality of human hearts that spoke empty words. Hunger truly has an unbelievable and amazing power! She roars like a sea wave, wanting to submerge everything! It roars like a lion, wanting to devour everything! Aren't the masses of China now trapped in a tragic state of hunger and cold?</p>
<h3>My Daughter-in-Law is Good!</h3>
<h3>I Want My Son!</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor,</p>
<p>Your column is like the red and green traffic lights on the road. Since its birth, I don't know how many problems it has solved. I have a matter concerning my children and grandchildren that I would like to ask you about. I think you will definitely not refuse. The facts are like this: I am an old accountant in a silk and cloth shop. I have two sons. The younger one is still in middle school, and the older one is twenty-two years old this year. In 1929, I arranged a marriage for him. At that time, their feelings did not seem incompatible. Soon after, my son joined the military in early 1930 due to difficult family circumstances and is now serving in the political department of a certain army. He usually sends two letters home every month, and at least one. This year, because his grandmother was seriously ill, I wanted him to come home once, but I was greatly disappointed. His reply said, "Unless I declare my divorce from the woman you arranged, don't think about me coming home, and from now on, I will stop sending letters to show my determination," etc. Indeed, it has been three or four months since then, and there has been no letter. In my opinion, he must be bewitched by some free love. Mr. Editor, this matter makes me angry and not angry. His wife is hardworking at home, extremely patient, has an intelligent mind, and manages all the affairs of the household. Furthermore, she has none of the extravagant habits of modern women. In this case, what should I do? If I don't let her divorce him, my hateful son will definitely not realize his mistake. If I let her divorce him, it would not only be morally wrong, but it would also not be legally permitted. In this dilemma, how can I make my hateful son realize his mistake? Is it possible to let her divorce him? I think you have great knowledge and will definitely solve it for me. Finished, wishing you peace in editing. Wu Shenwu sincerely</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>Editor's Note: In our opinion, this matter is not difficult for Mr. Wu. Whether your son and daughter-in-law divorce or not is purely their own business. You not only have no right to interfere, but even if you want to, you can't control it. If they want to divorce, even if your daughter-in-law is good, you cannot force them to stay together. If they don't want to, you should send a letter to your son, explaining that the matter of divorce must be discussed in person upon his return. As a father, you cannot do it for him. At the same time, give your son's letter to your daughter-in-law so that she knows her husband's attitude. After your son receives the letter, whether he returns or not is up to him. As for your daughter-in-law, the three attitudes she takes below are all legal. 1) She can file a lawsuit with the court based on the letter, remarry, and reserve the right to claim damages. 2) She can sue in court. You can file a lawsuit with the competent court where the marriage is registered. After acceptance, the court can send a document to the court where your son is employed to assist. However, this procedure often has difficulties in being shelved. Therefore, if she has the power, she can go to the court or military court to which your son currently belongs to file a lawsuit, which is more powerful. 3) She pretends not to notice and remains in your residence as if nothing happened. In this case, her marital relationship with your son continues to exist. At any time when your son returns, she can file a lawsuit for abandonment or bigamy. The second method above is of course the toughest, and I hope she doesn't take it. The third method seems gentle on the surface, but it is absolutely contrary to your desire to "want your son to return." Therefore, you might as well express this desire when you hand your son's original letter to your daughter-in-law. If she agrees, then the divorce is set, and your son will be willing to return. The remaining issue of compensation will be borne by your son. However, the matter of divorce is best resolved through negotiation. Going to court is unavoidable. So you need to tell your son to come back and discuss it in person. When you write to your son, you must clearly and repeatedly explain this.</p>
<p>We have always advocated that for divorce, it is better to separate frankly than to sleep in the same bed with different dreams. However, we advocate that those who are arbitrarily abandoned should bear considerable responsibility.</p>
<p>Correction: Due to the author's carelessness, the page numbers of the original manuscript were not clearly indicated, resulting in a disordered sequence. Therefore, upon hearing that a page was missing from Section 8, a passage was immediately added temporarily. Who knew that this passage would later be published again in Section 10. The following corrections are now made: Please discard "I don't know when... it would be nice to marry him" from line 26 of Section 8. "Feeling emotional... it would be nice to marry him" from after line 12 of Section 10 "Not appealing this way" should be inserted into the blank space of Section 8. As for the number "feeling emotional" at the end of line 25 of Section 8, please also remove it and connect it to form the phrase "But because of laziness..." "Not appealing this way" in line 12 of Section 10 is followed by "This demon..." in line 23 of the same section. I am very ashamed. In addition to the corrections, I would like to apologize to the readers and editors.</p>

<h3>The Life of the Five Beauties (3) (11) (1) (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Linghe</p>
<p>Twenty-Eight, Revenge (2)</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhang Wenbin walked out from inside, elegant and refined, bowing respectfully to the two tycoons separately. Then, he calmly handed a roll of documents to Su Gengyun and opened a collotype printing for them to look at a few pages. He said:</p>
<p>"The original manuscript of the documents will of course be returned, but a copy like this should be kept as a souvenir because it is the most precious treasure in Chinese diplomacy and also ironclad proof of your patriotic enthusiasm."</p>
<p>Once crisis, from then on peace returned.</p>
<p>Twenty-Nine, After the Success of the Revolution</p>
<p>From then on, many years passed, until the Fifth Madam was already twenty-seven years old. Counting from the Chinese Revolution, it has already been five years. Now that the revolution has taken place, the government must make big changes. Of course, Minister Su also said that he was unhappy to interact with the revolutionaries, so this is one of the most significant political achievements after the revolution. To put it more clearly, it is as Wu Gui said: "A country without an emperor is already unheard of, but who knew that now even the president is not needed? 'Chairman,' even the tone is not loud enough. Moreover, instead of establishing a capital in Beijing, which has the imperial palace, they insist on moving from Wuhan to Nanjing, Nanjing to Luoyang, and Luoyang back again. It's simply like children playing around. In short, these years have become more and more unreasonable, even changing Beijing to Beiping. And the four northeastern provinces have been leased to Japan."</p>
<p>Of course, people like Wu Gui can't understand anything, they don't understand the mysteries of the government. But even though such a person is thinking wildly, he has not been arrested and imprisoned, probably because civil rights have long been guaranteed.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing that makes Wu Gui very happy, and that is that young master Zhang has actually been promoted from first secretary to director of the intelligence department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. So the Fifth Madam is filled with joy, Wu Gui follows her joy, and there is also a He Xiang who is secretly happy. Precisely because Zhang Wenbin cannot often leave Nanjing, the Fifth Madam has recently bought a foreign house in Tangshan, which is considered a summer resort.</p>
<p>As for Grandpa Su Gengyun, he is still as busy as before. Although he refuses to officially take the stage again as a minister, he cannot help but come out to help when national disasters occur. He always has to give ideas on important diplomatic cases.</p>
<p>However, he has become much older in these years. The Fifth Madam also rarely has the interest to come often, but in accordance with the "agreement," she is still paid 100,000 yuan per month by the Bank of Taiwan.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we put ourselves in his shoes, this old gentleman with high morals is indeed too pitiful.</p>
<p>Once, Minister Su happily came to Shanghai from Beijing. In addition to state affairs, he naturally wanted to be close to the Fifth Madam. This day, he bought two new pieces of clothing for her and happily accompanied the Fifth Madam for a few days. Although the summer days were long, they passed quickly and happily. Last night, he played a game of Jai Alai for the whole night and was inevitably very tired. Both of them slept until the afternoon. Then he suggested going to see Mei Lanfang's "Wild Mountain Tears," which he had performed after getting his doctorate from the United States. Who knew that at 4:00 PM, the Fifth Madam was sitting at her dressing table when she suddenly received a telegram from Zhang Wenbin in Nanjing, telling her to take the night train immediately. So she told the maid to pack her suitcase and told the old man:</p>
<p>"I have to go to Nanjing now. You stay at home for a few days. We'll go see the play another day."</p>
<p>"But," he said angrily, "I traveled all the way from Beijing, can't you spend a few days playing with me?"</p>
<p>"That won't work. People have things to do. Who cares about watching?"</p>
<p>Sadly, upon hearing these words, he had no choice but to remain silent.</p>

<h3>"Technocracy" in Hollywood Thoughts (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhuxian</p>
<p>When it comes to these Hollywood stars, regarding their attitude towards Technocracy, we must first remember their background. The big stars of Hollywood are all lucky ones. Their earnings can be as high as one or two million dollars per week. Therefore, they are not willing to give up their current superior position and work like everyone else, earning only $20,000 a year. But in Hollywood, there are still many workers who work hard all year round, and their income is less than a big star's daily earnings. Under this great disparity and unequal situation, what are their feelings? Let's examine it from various aspects.</p>
<p>One day at Pickfair, the residence of Fairbanks and Pickford, many stars gathered. After tea and dinner, little Fairbanks brought up the question of "supporting or opposing" Technocracy with Charlie Chaplin. Little Fairbanks said, "I have read almost all the books about Technocracy. In my opinion, it won't work. What's the reason? Because in my opinion, Technocracy is a utopian idea of averaging out humanity. I think this is impossible. This kind of ideal often sounds good on paper, but when it is put into practice, it won't work."</p>
<p>After a while, old Fairbanks also joined the discussion. He said, "My son knows more than I do. But I am an incurable optimist. Whether Technocracy works or not, the world will always improve. On a personal level, if this matter is beneficial to the public, I will of course support it." Charlie Chaplin said, "I have done in-depth research on the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan. Although Technocracy is a completely different ideal, in my opinion, it is not easy to succeed. But the rate at which the world is progressing now is very surprising. I firmly believe that in three years, there will be a new world and a new civilization. I hope that in the future, we will be able to live a utopian life like on the island of Bali in the South Pacific." Jack Oakie said, "What? What will happen to all the money I've saved for so many years? If Technocracy is implemented, there will be more and more fools in the world. The phrase 'diligent management' will completely lose its meaning. People don't have to struggle to improve." Lee Tracy heard this and immediately corrected him, saying, "Is money the only purpose of life? Indeed, money is extremely important, but you can't say that humans have no other ambitions besides money. Such as the ambition for fame..."</p>
<p>Carole Lombard was worried. She said, "After Technocracy is implemented, do women all have to wear the same clothes? I don't agree with that. I like to wear some unique clothes." A typist named Lucy also said, "Wow, 20,000 yuan a year is not bad. I support it!" A newsboy also shouted "Technocracy!" "I support it very much if I don't have to work until I'm 25 years old. A light bulb craftsman said, "As a light bulb craftsman, I first have to study electrical engineering for six years, and I only earn a few dollars a week. But he (referring to a star) hasn't even received much education, and he earns thousands of dollars a week. This is too unfair. Let experts handle this kind of thing, and it won't be so messed up."</p>
<p>However, a temporary actor who earns seven and a half dollars a day actually opposed it. He said, "I work hard and earn seven and a half dollars a day. But I have my future, and I work hard for that future. If everything is averaged out, I will lose my goal of striving. The meaning of my life will be reduced." (The End)</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>After Viewing "Innocence"</h3>
<p>— Xu Hairong</p>
<p>The performance aspect starts off awkwardly. Why use a written explanation for something that happened eighteen years ago? This filming method makes it even harder for the audience to understand. For example, after Wei Guang is released from prison, it immediately cuts to Pipa returning home from the streets. If we hadn't read the synopsis beforehand, we would be completely lost. The two young women sitting behind me, during that scene, I heard them repeatedly asking each other, "Who is this? Who is this?" This clearly demonstrates the inappropriateness of such filming.</p>
<p>I found the actors' performances too reminiscent of the "civilized drama" style. Their movements don't seem very natural, especially Han Langan's portrayal of the dance hall manager, which is far too exaggerated and absurd, resulting in a lack of authenticity throughout. Shanghai Company's cinematography and set design are consistently high-quality, and they maintain that reputation in this film. Some of the shots are truly well-done, such as the seaside scenes, which evoke a nameless sense of beauty. The director also employs some clever techniques that can be considered successful, and the ending scene is extremely clever and worthy of praise.</p>
<h3>After Viewing "Tiger Roar, Lion's Howl"</h3>
<p>— Kun Ming</p>
<p>After the slapstick short, the feature film "Tiger Roar, Lion's Howl" starts with a bang. The entire film is very intense, especially the scenes of Clyde Beatty's training, and the scene of the fierce tiger and lion fight, with fur flying everywhere during the "Tiger Roar, Lion's Howl," is truly frightening. The comedic interludes are also well-integrated.</p>
<p>Although male lead Clyde Beatty performs under the intense gaze of angry tigers and lions, with danger imminent, his demeanor remains calm and composed. Female supporting actress Anita Dage, although a beautiful star, is unable to fully express her talent in this film, which buries her talent. In conclusion, this is worth watching, far superior to animal films like "Human and Animal Spectacle" and "Tarzan the Ape Man."</p>
<h3>A Clear Song in "Vitality"</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>In "Vitality," Chen Yumei very gently, filled with motherly love, coaxes her beloved child to sleep, singing a lullaby:</p>
<p>My little darling, darling, sleep quickly; sleep early at night, wake up early at dawn. Darling is so lovely, face like a rose. My good heart! Heart's little darling! Darling, close your eyes, heart, sleep quickly! Darling!</p>
<p>But her younger sister (played by Yuan Meiyun) also uses her melodious voice, not allowing her sister to monopolize the stage, singing a lively and happy song of butterflies and bees:</p>
<p>Butterfly, fly, fly, fly east, fly west, get lost in the flowers! Flowers as pillows, leaves as blankets, how happy, how carefree! Ah! When winter arrives, leaves fall, flowers wither, the butterfly loses its support, enduring the cold, enduring the hunger, how miserable!</p>
<p>Bee, buzz, buzz, fly west, fly east, working hard and diligently, preparing for times of need, building nests and making honey, busy with labor. Ah! When winter arrives, the wind is cold, the frost is thick, the bee lives comfortably in its nest, with plenty of food, warm and comfortable, endless happiness!</p>
<h3>Talking About "New Year's Eve" Again</h3>
<p>— Li Yuan</p>
<p>Talking about "New Year's Eve" now seems out of date! However, it left a very good impression on me, and not talking about it seems to let it down.</p>
<p>Having seen "Grand Hotel," I marveled at the magical power of Jin Yuanguo's money, which can expose the dangers of human hearts and the hardships of life in the short span of a day. However, after seeing Lianhua Company's "New Year's Eve," I am even more amazed at the rapid progress of our country's film industry. This film can indeed be compared to the "imported" "Grand Hotel."</p>
<p>The use of shots in "New Year's Eve" is truly commendable. For example, when the old man (Liu Jiqun) picks up the wallet, first joy, then suspicion—hesitation. At this moment, the clever director uses his (the old man's) back and forth, retreating and advancing footsteps to express it, coupled with appropriate lighting, which can very well grasp the audience's emotional tension. The telephone scenes in the film are well-interspersed. The best performance should be considered Liu Jiqun. He can express the several scenes of nervous mood and chaotic thoughts. If he can work hard, the future is limitless.</p>
<p>Han Langan has already given us a considerable understanding in "Morning in the Metropolis." In this film, there are very few opportunities to be on camera, but when the rich man (Xing Shaomei) throws the wine glass,</p>
<p>Mr. Han's surprise is very Chaplin-esque; sometimes it is even too much. If he can correct it, it is not difficult to be on par with Chaplin. I hope Mr. Han will encourage himself.</p>
<h3>Talking About "Spring Water, Love Waves"</h3>
<p>— Meng Gan</p>
<p>The domestic films after the so-called "change of style" in the film industry have indeed embarked on a vigorous path. Such as Lianhua's: "Three Modern Women," "City Nights," "Morning in the Metropolis"; Mingxing's "Torrent," "Rouge Market"; are all "good works after the change of style." And Mingxing Company especially paid attention to all women's issues, and this "Spring Water, Love Waves" is also a work discussing women's issues.</p>
<p>Here, it exposes the darkness of officialdom, the ferocity of the bourgeoisie, it put forward the slogan of going to the Northwest, and: gave those playboy sons who play with women a major warning, so this "Spring Water, Love Waves" is a masterpiece of Mingxing Company.</p>
<p>In terms of the director's skills, Zheng Zhengqiu felt that he had regressed a bit, because he was too negligent, but he still achieved considerable success in several scenes such as the lake tour.</p>
<p>In terms of the actors' expressions, Hu Die is the most natural and fitting, and she is successful. Yan Yuexian and Hu Ping are neither good nor bad. However, Sun Min has regressed much more than in "Future," and his expression is too stiff and forced. He is a promising young man, and I hope he will work hard! In short, this is an excellent and progressive work and is worth appreciating.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Counterattacks Shaw</h3>
<p>— You Ji</p>
<p>Shaw once said in New York: "Movies promote anarchy because they show heroes often using their fists to solve all disputes, rather than resorting to the law." Therefore, several Hollywood stars pretended to be brave and defended themselves, counterattacking Shaw.</p>
<p>"Mr. Shaw forgot that there are still people in the world who are willing to fight fairly," said Miss Kefulunxuesi. Miss Kai is a boxing fan, (not fond of boxing, but fond of watching boxing.) Also, actress James Jiana has done many funny things in films, he said to the famous playwright: "Only people who watch comedies would think of calling the police to solve those disputes."</p>
<p>The play is even more energetic in defending Hollywood, and returned a big cannon, hoping Shaw can hear it. In life, not everyone calls the police when they encounter difficulties."</p>
<h3>Film Novel Maedchen in Uniform (8)</h3>
<p>— Xin Fu</p>
<p>Produced by German Film Company, starring a joint cast of all female actors</p>
<p>Pei Bo walked through the hall and saw Mannila leaning against the wall alone, sobbing. Feeling a pang of sympathy, she walked over and said to her, "Don't cry. Wait for me in my room. I have something to say to you." Before long, Pei Bo entered the room and saw Mannila waiting there with a sad expression. They faced each other in silence for a while. Pei Bo was the first to speak, saying, "Man Fangla, do you know that they are preparing to expel you?"</p>
<p>Mannila then asked, "Then, will I still be able to see you?" Pei Bo hesitated for a moment, turned her face to the wall, and then replied, "Of course, I can't see you anymore!" Hearing this, Mannila's face turned pale instantly. She held her head in both hands and shouted, "Can't meet! How can I live on!"</p>
<p>Hearing Mannila's words, Pei Bo became anxious. She turned around and shouted very seriously, "Mannila, you should have confidence in yourself. You should be treated..." Mannila was already in tears, but she still tried to cheer up and asked Pei Bo, "Treated for what?" Pei Bo said, "Treat your infatuation." Mannila knew that she was finally disappointed! The future will no longer be bright! The person she loves most can no longer love her! She didn't say anything. She nodded, stood up, and ran out. After Mannila left the room, Pei Bo thought that something was wrong. She rushed out of the room and shouted, "Mannila!" Suddenly, she bumped into the principal at the door. She said to the principal angrily, "Do you want to know what I said to her? Come on!" So the principal and Pei Bo started arguing in the room. The principal said, "My school does not allow revolutionary ideas." Pei Bo said, "I quit. I can't bear to see this little girl unhappy all day long." But at this time, Mannila was like a lost soul, running to the highest floor, praying in her mouth: "God, heaven wouldn't be so dark, would it! I want to leave this world! I can't live on!" Poor Mannila, she had nothing in her heart except the thought of death.</p>
<p>In the dormitory, Mannila's classmates, because they didn't see her come back, searched everywhere, but where could they find her. Several classmates who were close to her started to cry. So the shouts of "Mannila" and "Mannila" and the sound of the alarm bell that people heard caused panic and chaos throughout the school. Finally, the classmates found Mannila, who was planning to climb down from that high level, and became even more horrified, shouting wildly. At this time, Pei Bo heard the shouts in the room, ran out in a hurry, and happened to see the students rescuing Mannila from danger. She was unconscious, sleeping in the arms of her classmates, unable to say a word. The students, seeing Pei Bo, surrounded her. Pei Bo couldn't help but gasp, saying, "It's good that the students saved Mannila's life, otherwise this tragedy would be forever imprinted in our minds!" At this time, the sacrosanct principal also seemed to realize something. She supported her cane, frowned, and walked down the stairs step by step. The whole scene was suddenly as silent as death. So this tragedy came to an end in the plaintive and mournful sound of the bell. (The End)</p>
