<h3>歐洲將召集四强會議</h3>
<p>麥唐納有與希特勒會見可能</p>
<p>各國對英首相外交言論反響</p>
<p>國民二十五日柏林電　英相麥唐納在下院發言、主張修改和約、此間政界皆加歡迎、各報預料英德對意相墨索里尼提出而經麥唐納贊同之協定建議、不日將交換意見、其性質雖難預定、但信英相與德總理之會晤、非不可能之事、惟聞初步談判、仍將由尋常外交機關辦理、待荆棘清除、然後作直接談話、而召集四强會議</p>
<p>路透社二十四日柏林電　德國政界評論昨日英相麥唐納在下院所發之演說、稱爲「非常冷靜」、足證法國已拒絶意相墨索里尼所提議之四强協定、政治觀察家玩讀麥氏之演詞、覺其語氣與麥氏在羅馬所表示之樂觀、大不相同、</p>
<p>路透社二十四日巴黎電　英相麥唐納今日在下院宣述渠此次赴日内瓦羅馬巴黎之結果、法國報紙對於麥氏所言、多加訾議、如巴黎迴聲報曰、慫恿報復、徒足鼓勵希特勒與墨索里尼之狄克推多肆虐耳、法報深恐英意所取之步驟、將引起修正和約、法報堅稱法國尙未準備及此云、英保守黨員邱吉爾所主外交事務應由尋常外交機關辦理之、其言殊反對麥氏之歐陸談判、而法國則大加稱讚、</p>

<h3>來唐納新計劃</h3>
<p>小協約表示原則上接受</p>
<p>土耳其亦要求軍備平等</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十五日日内瓦電　軍縮會議總委員會全日開會討論、對於程序問題、各方意見迄未確定、總委員會或即行延會、或繼續將麥唐納計畫逐章加以審議、均未可知、半官方面主張總委員會可結束辯論、而以英國計畫爲軍縮公約草案之基礎、但在討論詳細條欵之前、各國政府間、必須更作詳細之研究、此則亦爲　官方面所承認云、</p>
<p>國民二十五日日内瓦電　軍縮會議總委員會對英相麥唐納軍縮計劃之總辯論、料將延至下星期二日、目前所定之程序、委員會即將從事討論該計劃之細則、大約在耶穌復活節前可以　事、委員會突然加速工作、係出於主席漢德森之主張、漢德森初本反對迅速進行、以爲宜待政治空氣略見清朗、而尤注意英相麥唐納與意相墨索里尼運動四强諒解之努力、惟漢德森最近之主張、衆信不能裨補英國之計劃、蓋照目前之情形、英國之計劃終將擱起、如以前之各計劃然、觀於第一日之辯論、毫無實在結果、而徒表明列强意見之牴牾、即可見其一斑也、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十四日日内瓦電　本日下午軍縮會議總委員會、開始討論英相麥唐納所提軍縮計畫、羅馬尼亞外長蒂杜羅斯哥、以小協商各國名義發言、謂英國計畫、可作討論基礎、其中若干條文、固可承認、其餘則須加以修改、且有若干缺點、須予以補充、瑞士代表摩太謂、各國主張、互相參差、英國計畫、不啻一種折衷方案、而留有可以改善之地步、荷蘭匃牙利·及土耳其代表、均稱贊英國政府之努力、謂其計畫、能使人發生新希望、實爲一種顯著之進步、土耳其代表、言及羅馬曁巴黎談話、謂此種事、土國僅由報端知之、深爲可異、但欲採取有效之决定、必軍縮大會全體國家一致妥協而後可、土耳其代表、又問總委員會云、若干條約、關於陸海空軍之規定、旣欲取銷、則洛桑條約中、關於土國博斯破魯斯海峽、撤除兵備之條欵、是否同樣辦理、挪威丹麥代表發言之後、波蘭代表繼起致詞、渠僅提起若干關於手續上之問題、但保留在一般討論時發言之權、總委員會、定於明晨繼續討論、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十四日日内瓦電　本日下午英外相西門、乘飛機抵此、當即出席軍縮會議總委員會、該會開會時、土耳其代表發言、要求將軍備平等原則、推行於博斯破魯斯活峽撤除兵備區域、因是討論問題中、又加一種新資料、衆人預計一般討論、將繼續至星期一晚間、或星期二爲止、以後究應將英相計畫、繼續分章討論、而不間斷、抑應將討論延至復活節後、再行開始、屆時將由總委員會决定之、至軍縮會議各種技術上工作之延期問題、屆時恐亦將提起云、（按一九二二年土耳其與列强所訂洛桑條約、規定博斯破魯斯海峽、及達達尼爾海峽、及某某數島之兩側、俱設立不駐兵區域、）</p>
<p>路透二十四日倫敦電　英外相西門今日乘飛機由倫敦赴日内瓦、參加軍縮會總委員會關亽上星期英相所提草約之討論、因在里昻與日内瓦之途中、稍有耽擱故西門直至會議開始之後、始抵會塲、小協約國代表鐵杜萊斯首先開始公約之辯論、謂渠所代表之三小協約國、準備接受英國之提議、以此爲討論之基礎、但保留日後提出修正之權云、瑞士代表摩太亦抱此同樣態度、謂英相之計劃、已保全軍縮會議云、挪威土耳其等國代表相繼發言、對於所擬公約中之某數條、頗多枰擊、挪威代表藍格謂預算案之限制·軍火製造之監視·侵略之界說·及對於侵略國之懲戒等、皆爲應有之條欵、而此公約中竟一字不提、殊屬遺憾云、明日尙須辯論、大約星期二日辯論始可終畢、</p>
<p>華聨二十五日東京電　英首相麥唐納提出之新軍縮案、因關係日本甚大、爲嚴密對付起見、今晨十時在外務省召集陸軍·海軍·外交三省之重大連席會議、審議最後之訓令案、完成後即日電訓日内瓦日代表部照辦云、</p>
<p>路透二十五日東京電　日内將有訓令致日内瓦之日代表、聲明日政府對英國軍縮計劃之態度、聞聲明（一）不能承認破壞非戰公約者即實際爲侵略者、（二）不能承認關於陸軍限制之方案、因日本之鄰中俄兩國之軍力現未知之也、（三）不能承認海軍限制之建議、須俟去年十二月十日日本提出之建議討論時再决定態度、（四）不能承認空軍限制之方案、因日本航空事務之發展、仍在比較的落後也、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十四日巴黎電　外長彭古、今日接見報界外交記者、彭古謂、「予根據八年來在日内瓦所得之經騐、深信國際上無論舉行政治或經濟會議、如不在外交上先行準備、則斷難有成、國際會議席上公開討論、僅能爲各國外交部及使署間工作之最後一幕、試舉兩例言之、一年以來、軍縮會議遭遇之困難、其原因僅在籌備不充分、各國間意見之爭、設於事先設法消除、則會務將感便利矣、反之、羅卡洛條約之所以所功者、實因事前有長久之準備故也」云云、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>自北至南晦</h3>
<p>日本侵略東北囊括四省盡量發揮其武力侵略開拓疆土以遮飾其國内之醜惡轉換其國民對内之憤怒以向外發洩其實日本號稱軍國曾利用封建傳統之舊習所謂武士道精神又復輸入德意志的軍國主義自明治維新迄今六十年間多數日人皆孕育於此　圍中而「十年一戰之國策」尤爲陸海軍問所奉爲準繩者也然而資本主義制度由成長而濫熟之後戰爭所用之工具與夫實際上之底力皆須以國民富力及天然富源爲基礎然後立體戰鬭乃有把握日本則全國國富不過一千零二十二億日金（僅及美國六分之一）煤鐵之藴藏殊甚貧乏石油鑛藏尤爲稀少一旦挑動國際戰爭海上航行被人封鎖則不待疆塲之决勝即自陷於困境矣故乘我國實力不備國防疏懈之時一舉而侵襲東北再舉而蹂躪熱河煤鐵之缺陷乃可於處女地之東北四省得之</p>
<p>軍國之日本且不以獨吞東北四省爲滿足列國尙欲回復東洋之國際平衡堅持滿洲之門戶眞正開放耶則國聨公理已講至盡頭日本蠻横進逼不已於是乎波瀾突起赤道以北馬里阿納加洛林馬夏爾三羣島之代管因日本退出國際聨盟遂發生問題矣就國際間常例而論日本旣退出國聨則其受國聨委託代管之地域當然退還無有疑義但日本於此殊多遁詞其軍部則以爲</p>
<p>「…日本即退出國聨對南洋之委任統治并未解除、…况事實上（南洋諸島）爲日本國防之生命線故須堅决保持之…」</p>
<p>「…關於委任統治（南洋兩羣島）問題就國際法上的見解雖然有種種議論現在最妥當的見解是委任統治地的主權應該歸諸五大聨合國換一句詞說就是委任統治地的主權不屬於國際聨盟何况我（日本）的委任統治地是C式統治地就該是日本領土的一部分可以在那裏作一切的施設所以我國（日本）退出國聨之後也斷斷乎没有把牠還給國聨的必要不過是對國聨提出統治年報而已……」</p>
<p>所謂「國防」所謂「生命線」竟由北而南延長至於赤道以北三羣島在凡爾賽和約締結之初於德國舊殖民地之處置乃交付與聨合國代管而此種代管當爲和平的代管决不能任代管之國家爲自國利害關係而設置軍事防禦或作爲海軍軍事要塞者然日本代管南洋三羣島以來即暗中建築要塞其建築費已在一千五百萬日金以上自小笠原諸島沿馬里阿納羣島至於巴拉俄成一弧形其意何居固不待智者而知其爲對美也蓋美國之於遠東欲積極開發但以根據薄弱菲利濱孤懸六千海里之外雖有夏威夷居間接濟而四千里海程又烏能期其聨絡之密切耶</p>
<p>「關門」與「耶普」兩島洵爲美菲之間聨絡要道設使「關門」要塞建築完成則海軍根據較之馬尼刺尤爲便利但拘於華盛頓條約限於美國現時財力祗得暫時擱置於是蔑棄國際條約信義之日本遂得秘密進行其軍事的建築設使一旦太平洋上發生變故彼即可以憑恃地利運用其海軍短時間内剪斷美菲間之聨繫使我國全士盡在其威脅之下美國縱有强大海軍欲飛渡五千餘里之太平洋而攻破横須賀與其他任何支點亦恐難免不陷於日俄戰爭時代波羅地海艦隊之覆轍</p>
<p>故日本軍國主義者乘此國際紛擾未定歐洲騷動不安美國金融恐慌未息我國無能爭戰之際巧取豪奪變和平之代管而爲武裝之統治且已明白表示决不放手竟認南洋赤道以北三羣島爲其國防之生命線矣美國雖在委任之初首提出交換條件在條約上可謂握有「顧問」之權德國在今日國民主義澎湃之時當然不能不起而過問然皆道遠力微不及日帝國主義者形勢之便利惟太平洋之制覇實爲北美合衆國之生死關頭萬難坐視今後局勢之推移日美爭執較日德之爭執更爲嚴重恐非往時之抗議爭辯所得而了結也</p>

<h3>通告退出國聨</h3>
<p>（東京）　日樞密院定二十七日上午十時在宫中開本會議、審查退出國聨議案、關於此案之處理方法、在二十二日會議後、各顧問官已約通過該案、故日政府預料二十七日之會議可望通過、外部將以内田外長名義、電國聨秘書長特魯蒙、不經過日本代表部或駐外使館、在東京即以官報與聲明同時宣布、退出範圍、僅限在國聨大會及理事會、其他機關仍不即不離、留在後日再加入聨盟之餘地云、（二十五日華聨電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日重臣元老及鈴木若槻兩總裁、對軍部所倡之退出國聨說、初以自重論不贊同軍部、因軍部以武力脅迫、遂勉强相從、聞樞密院對内田外交亦表示不滿、内田僅能爲軍部傀儡、毫無外交經綸、若以内田荒木之軍刀外交繼續幹下去、不僅歐美變爲仇敵、就在遠東亦不能獲得相近之友邦、所謂亞洲聨盟、祇不過等於痴人作夢、故二十七日之本會議、將附下列希望、要求通過原案、（一）須積極進行中日直接交涉、從速緩和對立之僵局、（二）武力外交須擇機而行、目前之形勢、爲解决國内之經濟恐慌、只有制止中國之抵制日貨、樞府提出之意見、明顯暗示要求内田下台、因爲荒木内田在廟堂一日、中日交涉無法進行故也、（二十五日華聨電）</p>

<p>（東京）　據柏林來電、日本政府若退出國聨、德政府以爲南洋諸島應歸還國聨、實質的由國聨統治、而形式上希望復歸德國、傳已準備開始預備交涉云、日海軍當局對之、觀測如下、依同盟及協約國與德國之和平條約第百十九條、德國政府顯將德國殖民地割讓與同盟與協約國、故德國關於此之返還、固承認其與國聨與協約國之交涉、惟對協約國之一國日本交涉係屬不嘗、而爲日本所不允者也、若德國有此企圖、恐此爲對内關係而起者、即或將南洋諸島歸還德國、恐英法兩國懼德國之擴充軍事、而將加以反對也、即如美國恐亦未必同意、帝國政府之方針、則毫無所動、將以下列理由、日本雖通告退出國聨、而仍得領有南洋諸島也云、（一）長期委任統治、事實上歸受任國所領有、於數次之國聨大會與委任統治委員會、曾正式與非正式闡明之、（二）德國政府於凡爾塞條約、曾抛棄委任統治地域之主權、故無對此之發言權也、（三）非會員國之得爲受任國、若美國之爲阿美尼亞委任統治受任國、其先例也、（二十五日電通電）</p>

<h3>美國金融恐慌的成因（紐約通信）</h3>
<p>股票市價狂跌人民負債纍纍</p>
<p>銀行週轉不靈百業大受影響</p>
<p>世界上第一個富强的國家、資本主義各國的領袖、吸集了全世界現金總數百分之四十二的北美合衆國、現在竟至要停止金本位了、并且一千五百萬的失業工人、都瀕於饑餓線上、中等以上的人家、也失掉了從前優裕生活的景象、美國三千萬工人之中、有幸運而得到職業的僅祇一半、他們的工資和薪俸有的減低了百分之二十、有的竟減少了百分之七十、總平均計算、實際減少了百分之五十六又五、股票黃金時代、即普通股票的紅利、就可以維持很寬裕的生活、現在却已成爲舊夢了、</p>
<p>一九二九年的股票市價、總值三千四百六十億美金、現在僅值三百三十三億美金、這樣子的狂跌、眞和作夢差不多、（跌價的百分比、竟至们百分之九十二）個人和交易所的負債計有一千二百三十萬萬美金、其中公司負債有四百四十萬萬美金、不動産階級的擔保負債有五百七十萬萬、農村負債有二百萬萬美金、這些新的負債者、在一九二八到一九二九年時、一塊美金現在就要支付三毛三仙的利子、一九二九年時候、美國國民所得有八百五十萬萬、去年所得不過四百九十萬萬美金、其間有五分之一、是被利子吃去了、</p>
<p>民間負債旣如是巨大、國家的會計又怎樣呢、美國的國債總數計有二百零八萬萬又六百萬美金、從一九二九年以來、就增加了三十八萬萬七千五百萬美金、一九三三年會計年過去七個月中、歲入不足、已經有十二萬萬七千一百七十二萬一千零二十一元美金、去年一月底美國的國債還只有一百七十八萬萬一千五百八十六萬一千一百十七元美金、今年一月底就增加到二百零八萬萬一百七十萬七千一百三十四元美金了、實際上是增加了了三十萬萬元美金的國債、設使没有世界大都城紐約和罪惡的淵藪支加哥銀行團的援助、全國各産業就會破産、握紐約市政牛耳的「塔穆勒」（民主黨俱樂部）也不能不向銀行團低頭、殊不知國民所得雖然收縮、而「金元」的價值反轉高漲、拿一九二九年來比較、一般的生活費減少了百分之二十二、這就是說三年前的一元、如今是要一元三毛三仙了、換一句話說、是三年之前用少數的「金元」可以購得較多的物品、在三年前借了錢的人、一金元是要以一元三毛三仙來償還纔夠、所以在負債階級從前付六厘利息的、現在須付八厘利息了、至於農民那就更厲害了、因爲農業生産品價格猛跌、例如從前以收穫小麥作擔保借進來二千美金、丨四年前的市價每布式爾（約我國三斗六升）小麥值美金一元、則二千元須以二千「布式爾」小麥償債、現在的時價值不到五十仙、最少要對債主支付一倍以上、丨即四千布式爾小麥纔足以還債、這是何等的陰森景象、</p>
<p>羅斯福總統上台的第一天、就碰着「金融恐慌」、世界的「金」王、就要從王座上翻下來、他第一着要走的是改建「金元」的價值、并且「金元價值如没有增大、則美國人民也就更難得活起來、曾記上院議員波拉氏說過、</p>
<p>「一九二九年美國國民所得總計有八百五十萬萬美金、去年（一九三二年）竟祗有三百七十萬萬了、若以全國男女老少一律平均計算、在一九二九年時每人平均所得有七百元美金、現在竟减到三百元了、可是每個人還要擔負聨邦政府·州政府·市政府·等等租稅、約七十七元美金、固定利息的負擔、也假定牠爲七十七元、則一九三二年國民所得就只有一百四十五元美金了、則是每個人每月平均的生活費、只有十二塊美金、……」</p>
<p>這種的情况、在生活程度是世界第一個高貴的國家、北美合衆國人民的苦况、縱然不至於是活地獄、可是住在哈德生河邊矮小屋子裏面的失業者、旣没有失業　保險金、又没有工作、祇有睜着眼睛挨餓、同時垣街的金融資本家、又是有錢無處使、南美諸國旣宣告停付一切債欵、美國的一部分投資是收不回來了、歐洲各國應該比南美好些、可是戰債恐怕也没有償還的希望、對遠東市塲的黄金夢、又爲日本的鐵拳所擊破、現在眞不曉得前途怎樣了、戰債問題的解决、關稅壁障的撤廢、軍備的縮小、國際經濟會議、滿洲的機會均得、門戶開放等等、都是美國當前擺着的大問題、必須解决纔能找得出路、但是一般人民對這些事都似乎很冷淡、實際上也是缺乏理解、他們所要的、近若如何减低通貨的價值、打開國内國外貿易的新途徑、遠若如何恢復已往的繁榮、使物價上昇、使一般人購買力增加、</p>
<p>然而、信用凍結、人心淨動、各州發行臨時貨幣到處盛行、銀行的週轉、更見不靈、從米西干捲起的金融狂潮、到今天巳經遍滿全美國了、各地銀行都關了門、昨天是百萬富豪、隔了一晚上竟至一貧如洗、普通的商店雖没有關門大吉、可是大家都没有錢買東西、他們的買賣、也只好等着、各銀行宣告停業、對旣已窮困達於極點的中等以下人家、似乎關係很薄弱、富豪受困、反而更厲害、</p>
<p>「物物」的交易本是原始時代的一種社會形態、不意達於近代文明頂點的美國社會、於金融恐慌期中見之、這種情况、我們以常識推測、就一般經濟狀况考究、當然不至於長久繼續下去、可是美國的人民、却是會更增加苦痛、也不知何時纔得恢復繁榮、（一九三三·三·五日於紐約）</p>

<p>本月二十三日下午八時半、南市製造局路後街斜橋東弄四十四號乍浦人張明所開之萬元新醬園、曾被盜刦、詳情已誌昨日本報、茲悉該盜等已於前昨兩日被獲搜得手槍子彈贓物各情、分誌於下、</p>
<p>盜匪匿跡　該男女盜匪等刼後携贓逃往公共租界五馬路山東路金壽里六十號九華旅館、開二十八號及三十四號兩房間、互相分贓、除鈔洋分配外、將衣服金飾變價化用、</p>
<p>購買衣服　該盜黨中、一盜身穿灰色西裝雨衣、内襯古銅色線春長袍、偕一女盜、身着條子衣服、於前日下午一時三刻、赴福建路（卽石路）六馬路口鴻福衣莊購買衣服、經該衣莊夥友任賓來接待、出示小人夾衫、因貨色不佳、致與任賓來發生口角、</p>
<p>察出破綻　鴻福衣莊内有乍浦人職員陸昌林、卽住居南市製造局路後街斜橋東弄四十四號同鄉人張明所開之萬元新醬園樓上、亦被盜刼之一、當時陸在櫃旁、細看顧客、頗似盜黨、旋聽其口操江北音、且見雨衣背後、染有泥漿不少、</p>
<p>擒獲經過　陸昌林見該盜購衣不成、轉身卽去、遂跟踪至五馬路山東路金壽里進弄、該男女兩盜復外出、行經福建路四馬路公泰衣莊門口、陸昌林乃鳴該處五三○號華捕、男盜當被擒獲、女盜則由人叢中兎脫、</p>
<p>提回訉辦　當時經老閘捕房探員等、一度盤詰、因事出華界、乃通報市公安局、偵緝隊長盧英、當派該隊駐二區領班武秀峯、持文前往、將該盜帶隊訊據盜犯供稱、「朱金山、年三十四歲、清江人、直認糾夥持槍行刼、並在身畔搜出贓物、又供出同黨匿居地點、</p>

<p>嚴密訉究　訊究各盜時、由該隊傳失主到隊指認盜等無訛、且各盜均供認得贓化用、並供出手槍二支、藏於南市煤屑路一五一號馬車行内、盧氏仍派原班探員、於昨日中午十二時許、會同二區警士按址前往、搜得手槍二支、子彈十二粒、並拘獲清江女人馮王氏一名、年二十歲、一併帶隊、收押鞫訊、聞各探員定今日分赴各押當吊贓、並續緝在逃餘黨、故暫押隊中、</p>
<p>償、結果由乃姊調停、賠襪一打、其欵在工資扣住、根兄當遭乃姊之埋怨、根兄以作工所得、戔戔之數、不足賠一打襪、憤然歸家、不願再作至廿五日亦不願到廠中去、其母催促亦不願、迨午後而根兄愈思愈憤、乘母出外之際、一人掩至後房鐵床上、即解褲帶自縊身死、至下午五時、乃母歸家看見、急行解救、已經不及、於是撫尸大慟、由二房東報告一區一所、派廿三舖地甲秦德方前往調查明確、派工看守、昨日上午、由秦投地方法院報騐、而尸父投案、請求免騐、未奉核准、下午經楊檢察官宣檢騐員等蒞塲、騐明委係自縊身死、諭由家屬收殮、候查明核奪、</p>

<h3>童子軍與「新使命」</h3>
<p>丨本埠尤誠君來信丨</p>
<p>貴報自刋行「讀者信箱」以來所討論的問題。不可謂不多。惟對於團體方面的討論。尙感缺乏。鄙人不敏。敬以童子軍事業問題。敢供讀者研究。並懇賜予篇幅。以述管見如后。</p>
<p>童子軍敎育在今日猶如雨後春笋般勃發。而負責領導的機關。自應充分健全。庶不致蹈過去毫無組織之覆轍。去年一二八之役。上海童子軍理事會。爲民前鋒。毅然决然。召集本市童子軍團長及敎練。共赴國難。組織戰地服務團。在前方實地參與抗日。在後方營救災民及服務傷兵醫院收容所。其工作的表現。確切勇敢努力。足見中國靑年實負有繼往開來的重大新使命。</p>
<p>按諸童子軍訓練原理原則。其精神的專注。身心的健全。和勇敢犧牲摯誠的意志力。謂爲中國靑年之模範。亦不足愧。我們再觀童予軍的十二條規律「誠實，盡忠，助人，友愛，禮節，愛物，服從，快樂，節儉，勇敢，清潔，公德」之後。更深切地認識童子軍固有的品性和其智仁勇精神。這十二條規律而以之爲中國靑年界唯一之良劑。在個人方面。養成人　高尙。體魄健全。常識豐富的有爲人才。在國家社會和世界人類方面。促成人類互助和平博愛的現象。而漸臻至於民有民治民享的大同世界實現。觀此益足證明童子軍訓練。是救國的重要份子。是浪漫，輕浮，怯弱，愁悶的勁敵。那末這種良好靑年之得以造就。當然端賴有經騐學識明達忠仁的人才。以負責陶冶靑年不可。反之。如無充分經騐學識。一似現社會的敗類。而草率敷衍沽名釣譽之輩來訓練此童子軍。則其結果反使靑年放縱欲爲。不尙實際。貽害匪淺。……（完）</p>
<p>答：足下來信談及童子軍的問題。不過記者在十餘年前，因爲在敎育界服務。也曾親身創辦過童子軍，當時因爲要舉行童子軍成立典禮，大家要我做一篇緣起，我因此曾經稍稍考察過童子軍的歷史與社會關係，今天且借着這個機會，說一說記者現在對於童子軍本身一點意見。不過我先得要聲明，這是我個人的意見，不是什麽「絶對無諍」的理論。（一）我記得童子軍的産和理這樣的：有一個英國的人，（是軍官抑是新聞記者，或游歷家，記不得了）在菲洲殖民地，看見軍隊中的黑人的士兵生活非常刻苦，簡直非白種人所能忍受，而黑人則處之泰然。某英人心裏想：假使英國與殖民地有戰爭，就是說，殖民地起來反抗，英國去鎭壓，以舒服慣了的英國人恐怕没有必勝的把握，於是他回國之後就創立一種組織，專門使靑年學生練習勞苦並受普通的軍事訓練，未幾這種組織普遍全國且且傳播到世界。這就是所謂「童子軍」一個簡短的歷史。他的起初目的只在組織一輩靑年，對外做鎭壓殖民地的反叛之武裝準備，所謂「鎭壓反革命」的暴力基礎。（二。童子軍不是我們中國的愛國靑年反抗日本帝國主義的革命戰爭的中什麽力量，童子軍的服裝非常整齊，打仗的時候「在後方營救災民，在戰地服務，」如是而已。然而我們眼中的中國靑年不是這樣的。我們的愛國靑年，應當自己拿起武器來和日本帝國主義者拚命，和日本帝國主義者的走狗，賣國奴拚命，然而這種鬥爭，現在的童子軍是做不到的。（三）童子軍的所謂信條，如足下所舉的：「誠實，盡忠，助人，友愛，禮節，愛物，服從，快樂，節儉，勇敢，清潔，公廳，」云云，都是些抽象的，摸不着頭腦的敎條，也猶之現在的名人所提倡的「禮義廉恥」等等一樣地不是我們救亡圖存的具體的，行動的綱領。所謂「盡忠」，自然是從古大臣的「進思盡忠，退思補過」的格言中抄來的，但是我們現在對誰盡忠呢？所謂「服從」，又服從誰呢？而且忠又是怎樣盡法？服從又有什麽標準呢？假使你在一個賣國賊手底下做事情你也要對他盡忠嗎？你也要對他服從嗎？這末一來，只有把靑年都造成一個簡單的頭腦，替少數人做工具，實在要不得。（四）在目前我以爲眞正愛國靑年應當「異軍起」組織一種普遍而偉大的武裝動員的團體，或即定名「中國靑年抗日救國團」，只要是愛國靑年，不論他是學生也罷，靑年店員也罷，靑年工人也罷，靑年農民也罷，只要他是誠心獻身給抗日救國這一艱鉅鬥爭的，都有加入的資格。牠的綱領約應如下：（一）用自己頭腦，站在最大多數民衆立塲上去思想一切，分析一切，研究一切。（二）要盡忠，也只有對最大我數所保護的國家盡忠，也只有對最大多數所保護的國家盡忠，對反抗日本帝國主義的革命戰爭盡忠，要服從也只有服從保護國家與反抗日本的革命民衆所信任的團體。（三）聨合全國最大多數的靑年武裝抗日。（四）普遍地實施軍事訓練：機械的，化學的，兵式的；（五）要求政府發給武裝；（六）擔任對大多數貧民的義務敎育，演講中日戰爭的原因，其形勢，其關係，其結果與國民應負之任務；（七）研究抗日的方法，並帮助一般民衆組織各種抗日團體；（八）對民衆講演防禦毒氣及其他必要的戰爭中一般人民應有的常識與技能，如消防，救護，傳達，擔架等等；（九）應深深地意識着：只有全國民衆自動地，一致地團結起來做抗日的主力擔負起抗日的使命，抗日才有積極的，眞實的意識與希望；若是徒徒地在後邊微弱無力地搖旗呐喊，光靠着幾個兵去和日本較量，不但他們不會堅决地抗戰到底，即使萬一他們抗戰到底，也不過只　在歷史上留下悲壯的一頁罷了！至於上海童子軍前年在戰地服務，有點勞績，這並不是童子軍的成効而是中國民衆一點點的民族意識有以驅策之的結果。盡這一點義務不是童子軍可以，即普通的靑年學生也可以做到。足下即以此斷定「中國靑年實負有繼往開來的重大的新使命」，母乃視事太易乎？而且所謂繼往開來，究將何繼而何開？所謂「新使命」又安在耶？敢請丨</p>

<h3>西捕勝優游</h3>
<p>結果八比三</p>
<p>今日優游戰曁南</p>
<p>丨下午三時在逸園丨</p>
<p>優游足球隊昨戰西捕於逸園球塲、觀者二三千人、優游守門梁官濂自日前虹口公園與臘克斯一仗手腕折痛後、至今未愈、昨由王才高出塲、前衛健將葉晋錦與石金生、亦因傷不克作戰、昨由陸士芳及毛鴻貴庖代、是以前衛力量减色、加以黄瑞華亦未有出色表演、使前鋒不能呼應、後方不克防守、遂被西捕以八比三大勝、今日下午三時、優游對曁南仍在逸園比賽、茲紀昨戰經過如下、</p>
<p>優游一度失機　西捕開球先攻、步步逼進、傑克試射、王才高救出、奚巧生送球右方、陳光翼沿邊侵入、衝至門側、對門力射、西捕守門勃拉特萊臥地撲出、陳再加一脚、球掠門越左、孫錦順、再行發射、成角球、陳光耀送出、又不得逞、</p>
<p>西捕連中兩球　西捕脫險以後、引兵反殺、培特傳中甚妙、德飛迎之以頭、正中門角、極爲清晰、距開賽僅十分鐘許、中央開球、西捕再度深入、優游後方、頗覺散漫之狀、透納傳球門前、培特一射中的、兩球之間、相距不滿兩分鐘、</p>
<p>優遊還敬兩只　優游旣失兩球、士氣大振、精神奮發、孫錦順兩次發射、均被救出、李石友帶球再進、爲敵所阻、但西捕兩衛救球互讓、奚巧生坐收漁利、躐前射門、一舉成功、於是優游勢盛、西捕門前、驚危不絶、孫錦順逼得角球、李石友踢出雖佳、未能得利、旋由黃瑞華傳球左方、李石友還至門前、胡有成一踢成功、射入門角、成二與二之比、</p>
<p>不料連失三城　造成二二平手以後、咸以爲優游可有制勝之望、不料西捕不甘示弱、咄咄逼人、氣燄甚熾、一刻鐘内、又使優游連失三城、西捕以五比二佔先、終了上半時、西捕射球者、（一）德飛、（三）培特、（三）派克、至於優失守原因、由於後方不能聨絡、陣容散漫所致、</p>
<p>西捕又獲兩球　下半時起、優游前方、益逞不振之象、陳光耀埋伏邊疆、鬱鬱不得志、奚巧生胡有成疏漏頗多、李石友困於敵人、孫錦順孤掌難鳴、故優游後方、異常吃緊、門前密佈敵軍踪跡、相持十分鐘時、培特邊球射來、德飛一衝而進、西捕又加一球、派克兩次攻門失機後、傑克亦衝進一球、造成七與二之比、</p>
<p>鐵脚百步穿揚　優游在暴力威脅之下、因少活動機會、惟陳光耀在門下曾一度得機攻門、奈因操之過急、脚步未準、射成野成、孫鐵脚觸景情傷、乃不顧一切、孤軍奮鬥、左衝右突、在離門二十五碼外、得球發射、殆爲迫不得已、作孤注之一擲、詎料球路甚佳、正中門角、不覺喜出望外、但爲時無幾、西捕派克又中一球、而以八比三終了、陣線如下、</p>

<h3>自殺與夢想</h3>
<p>— 思素</p>
<p>二十世紀之世界，到底不是古老時代了。古老時代是彼此不相聞問，抑且没有個「彼此」，亞洲不知有歐洲，歐洲不知有美洲；甚至在同一亞洲裏，中國人多數不能明確知道有個印度，只恍愡愡愡地以爲有個西天佛國，印度人達摩輩到中國來，大感不易，中國人法顯玄奘之流到印度去，也成爲歷史上的探險奇人。所以貼隣如日本，也恍恍愡愡的當做蓬萊仙境；直至六朝，方纔漸有點明確，知其也是個人類所居的國度。但兩方關係，仍然微細，不過是齊高帝授倭王武爲鎭東大將軍而已。現在是什麽時代了！日本縱然自恃强盛，人莫予毒，滿想開倒車開回古老時代獨吞了中國，也如元清之入主中華一般，始終没有别洲别國來干涉；可是時代的輪子，祇進不退，日本該懊悔强盛得晚了些，没有趕得上元清，再早點，趕在遼金之前也好。居今日而欲使時代輪子向後退，事實上到底辦不到，雖然强盛，也始終只是「自恃」雖然實行開倒車，也始終只是「滿想」。美國發生金融風潮，完全是美國自己之事，然而影響所所及，已是無遠弗屆，没一個大都市不被波動了。現在的世界，大有牽一髮而全身齒動之槪，卽一細事，只要佔一點國際性，也絶對關不起國門來，何况獨吞中國這一件無大不大的大事？更何况中國以内的國際，情形之複雜，較世界任何處所爲劇？日本竟僅憑「自恃」，「滿想」步武元清後塵，獨吞中國，不許第三者干涉；這「自恃」與「滿想」還不是等於「自殺」與「夢想」嗎！</p>
<h3>書聲</h3>
<p>— 啟楣</p>
<p>每次我走過私塾的門前，總有一片書聲，從裏面傳出，嘈雜得一句也聽不清楚。</p>
<p>記得我幼時在私塾的時候。這嘈雜的書聲，却有唯一的妙用。塾師是個體態龍鍾的老者。一天到晚，除掉免不了的講書圈字之外旗大半天的生活，消耗在床上的。但他並不熟睡；祇要外面書聲一停，立刻就會出來。於是我們就逼得採取這「高喊政策，」輪流高喊。一片嘈雜的書聲，就代作我們玩要的烟幕彈　說起了書聲，却又聨想起江北人的玩戲法。他們在塲上玩戲法的當兒，總有鑼鼓來助威，大打大擂，鬧得你頭昏腦脹。玩戲法的人，更提高了嗓子，指手劃脚的念咒，畫符。吵雜的聲音，造就了施展手脚的機會。祗要鑼鼓一停，什麽事都已完了。</p>
<p>現在的日本，也何嘗不是這樣。每在暗暗運兵要進占一個地方之前，總是揑造些事實，東扯西拉的說上了一大堆，使你「丈八和尙摸不着頭腦。」等到國際想去注意，「生米已成熟飯，」，計劃已變爲事實。</p>
<p>至於中國呢？九一八之後，什麽「長期抵抗」「臥薪嘗膽」「靜候國聨解决」「安内所以攘外」等等，在不諳邏輯學的我們聽來，實在也有些兒頭昏。不過他們是否也採取這「高喊政策，」並不實行，那祗有說過的幾位要人肚子裏明白。</p>
<h3>名譽黃金和美人</h3>
<p>— 張芷痕</p>
<p>丨幻滅的經過丨</p>
<p>郁君在新大陸研究電氣學，刻苦幾年，得了博士學位，鍍過了金，氣昻昻地回到故國，撰了好多論文，登在各著名的刋物上，名譽漸漸地高起來，全國學術界，誰不知郁時芳博士的大名。</p>
<p>各大學的校長，對於郁博士，都十二分表示欽佩，爭相羅致，郁博士竟同時担任六個大學的敎授，每星期中，來往××××之間好幾次，每月所入，連撰述酬金在内，竟有八九百元之多。</p>
<p>「英雄逃不過美人關」，新時代女性典型的誘惑，使郁博士苦悶煩惑，對人生少興趣，不知怎樣竟同××第一枝交際花霍女士，結成密友。</p>
<p>由名譽而得黄金，由黄金而得美人，什麽什麽都成功了。</p>
<p>×××××</p>
<p>郁博士和霍女士，蜜一般的愛，汽車，電影院，大菜館，跳舞塲，一切一切，都足使他倆陶醉，但，各大學等着郁博士去講學，不要緊，請朋友代，每月所入的薪給，不夠霍女士的揮霍，不要緊，向朋友借。</p>
<p>郁博士的荒唐史，電一般地速傳到各人的耳朶裏，各朋友不信任他了，各大學校長，不信任他了，錢也借遍了，到了第二學年的開始，各大學的聘書，一張也不送來了。</p>
<p>郁博士的風頭，不似當年之盛，郁博士的金錢，已入窘鄉，霍女士懷疑他了，蜜一般的愛，已經化學作用，變成淡如水了。</p>
<p>由美人而失名譽，由失名譽而失黃金，復由失名譽黄金而失美人，什麽什麽都幻滅了。</p>
<h3>杜君竽遠自熱歸來與侯女士結婚詩以賀之</h3>
<p>— 潘仰葊</p>
<p>何緣巧締同心結，國難聲中佳耦成，關外敵氛猶未靖，相期戒旦待鷄鳴。劍氣珠光映洞房，征裝甫卸鬢凝霜，枕邊共訴遼東根，不斬樓蘭恥不忘。願將蜜月先嘗膽，肯把雄心付畫眉，把臂共吟塞外曲，滿懷壯志兩相知。</p>
<h3>浸禮</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>門前高　着西洋古式的鐘樓；中間有可容千人的禮堂，那便是人盡知道的耶敎禮拜堂。耶敎是廢除崇拜偶像的，所以一些也找不出可以代表上帝的裝飾品。半圓形的講經台，上邊設着一隻小桌，幾張椅子，預備牧師講經用的。台的下邊，臥着鉅大的鋼琴；四周圍着置曲譜的三脚銅架，還有提琴咧，羗笛　，銅鼓　，這種種是唱詩班用的。再過去便是成排的長椅，很整齊的列着，預備聽道的人坐</p>
<p>高樓上的大鐘，噹噹的亂吼；無數的男女老幼，魚貫似的到禮拜堂裏。一副嚴肅而又虔誠的樣子，會使得你感覺得宗敎的奇妙。台上的老牧師，慈祥的容貌；和藹的態度；誠摯的語調，眞可以代表在天的和平神。接着唱詩了，好聽的弦樂，和着羣衆的歌聲：「啊哩路呀，讚美救主。」眞好像一羣天使在歌唱。老牧師閉着眼祈禱了，台下的人，一齊站着；也一齊靜默着，靜得差不多連每人的呼吸都聽得出，「亞門」一聲，大衆方自坐下。</p>
<p>牧師開始演講施浸的緣由，他說：「從前的耶穌，也曾到約但河受浸。我們現在信耶穌，也要受浸，一方繼續耶穌的工作；一方表示舊的罪惡洗去，新的生命再來。」</p>
<p>受浸的信徒，男的女的，排列在牧師面前·牧師一一替他們祝福。然後呌他們分别男女，各到各的更衣室裏更衣。　這時台後的水池，灌滿了温水；老牧師穿着牛皮製的聖衣，站立在水中。台下的唱詩班，很悠揚的唱着「阿哩路呀，讚美救主。」受浸的信徒，一個個穿着單衣，站在水中。老牧師替他們祝福，一個個渾身浸在水中，再攙他們起來，挨次的做去。施浸完了；音樂也停止了。老牧師筋疲力盡；受浸的信徒，也好像淴了一個嚴肅的冷水浴。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二回陋室結芳鄰暗欽健叟權家擇良伴痛詆貧娃</p>
<p>積之氣得把臉紅到耳根以後去，低了頭道：人家，也是好人……厚之將手上的筷子碗一放，兩手按了桌沿向他望着，問道：什麽好人？我倒要請敎，是他滿街跑得好嗎？說着，回頭向站在一邊的老媽子道：以後那個窮丫頭來了，别理他，找誰就說誰不在家。老媽子答應是。厚之這樣大發雷霆，甘太太只是向二人看着微笑。久而久之，才道：這也犯不上這樣大發脾氣。瞟了厚之一眼，於是向積之笑道；你别找急，要找媳婦，爲嫂的可以和你帮忙，要那一路的也有。那個老姑娘，旣是家寒，又没有一點新知識，和你也不相配。别在他身上注意了。積之還有什麽話說的呢，只有趕快把飯吃完了，自己走回房去。遠遠的還聽到哥哥在那堂屋裏左一句窮丫頭，右一句窮丫頭，呌個不了。心裏想着，倒不料哥哥會生這樣大的氣，莫不是楊家有什麽不高明的事，讓他查明出來了。照說老姑娘滿街跑這件事，這並没有什麽了不得，一來是旗人規矩如此，二來他家只有母女二人，買賣東西，不是娘出來，就是女出來，這也没有什麽錯處。就是老姑娘有什麽不高明的事情，井水不犯河水，這也没有什麽關係。只是哥哥說，以後他要來了，就不理他，假使他眞來了，老姑娘碰個釘子回去，那多難爲情？這只有去向他說，呌他以後不必來了。可是這話又說回來了，這種話，怎好去向人家說呢？難道就這樣明對他說，以後不必到我家去嗎？這樣子辦，那比打他駡他還要厲害了。可是要不這樣去說，等他到家裏來碰釘子，自己忍心讓人家去吃這樣一個大虧嗎？眞有這個事，以後只有彼此絶交了。甘積之左想右想，總想不出一個辦法，事情没有發作，自己倒先爲難起來。（二三）</p>
<p>兒童的樂園</p>
<p>— 楚</p>
<h3>鶴與蝦</h3>
<p>有一隻鶴，久住在池塘邊的樹上，那池塘裏生了許多魚蝦。鶴就靠魚蝦爲生的。後來鶴的年齡漸老，身體也不能行動，連魚也不能捕了，所以常常空腹飢餓，身體愈加瘦弱了。那鶴到了這時，想到：「年輕的時候，若是能夠多勞動，貯蓄了多少糧草自然不至有今日的樣子」心裏很懊悔過去的懶惰。某日，它在池塘邊彿徊，時時嘆息，忽然看見一隻蝦，那蝦問道：「鶴君，你爲什麽緣故，這樣頽喪呢？你不必呆想，趕緊去尋些東西吃吧，」鶴答道：「我的肚子，並不飢餓，我因爲想到今天早晨，有兩位漁夫到這裏來，有一位漁夫，想把這池塘的水車乾，還有一位漁夫主張想先把那邊的池塘的水車乾，大槪不久就要着手了。我聽到他們的話，一則很爲你魚蝦們憂慮，二則我也不能常常同你們在這裏爲友了，所以我的心裏很不安啊！」那蝦聽到這話，非常驚駭，就告訴那魚蝦們，那些可憐的魚蝦也很驚駭，立刻游泳到岸邊，請求那鶴想法子救它們的命，說道：「我們見了你，本來也是大仇敵，過去你戕殺我同胞們，不必再提起。不過古人有句話：窮鳥入懷，獵夫也不殺它的。現在情勢很緊，假使一旦漁夫來車乾這池塘的水，那末我們的生命都休了。我們若是都爲漁夫所捕，你豈忍心麽？所以應當爲我們想個法子，保全同胞的生命。」鶴答道：「我没有和漁夫對抗的能力，恐怕想不出來好的法子，不過漁夫去車乾那邊池塘的水，非一朝一夕的，須要幾個月工夫，我當盡力帶你們到别的池塘裏去吧。那魚蝦們一聽這話，都是非常喜歡，說道：「那末就請你帶我們去吧。」於是鶴就從這天起，開始搬魚蝦到他處去了。不料它每天早晨，　了二三尾的魚，飛到山上，把魚吃得乾乾凈凈。因此鶴的身體，也漸漸肥大，它以爲魚蝦們墮其彀中，從此都在它的掌中了。有一天，他照例的飛到池塘邊去　魚，看見有一隻大蝦等候。鶴就把蝦　到山上，那時這蝦看見地上有許多魚骨，知道以前鶴借代爲搬家爲名，都給它果腹了。它猛然的升開兩箝，箝住鶴的頭頸，鶴無法擺脫，一瞬之間，它的喉管被蝦箝斷，翻身死在地上。這時蝦雖不能在山上生活，然而已爲其他的魚蝦們報了大仇了。</p>
<h3>五指何故不齊</h3>
<p>人類的手，原來是爲走的作用，五個手指的長短不齊，就是爲支持重心的緣故。好比犬貓的趾爬行一般的，後來人體進化，漸漸的把原來的使用變更了。前脚（手）的爬行的效用，因代遠年深環境物質的關係，比後脚（足）愈加進步。後脚因爲專門用以走路的關係，慢慢的退化了。加以後脚的脚趾比前脚爲短，他的活動作用，當然要比前脚爲差啊。</p>
<h3>洗浴時的注意</h3>
<p>我們平常洗浴的水，温度應當在四十度内外，不可過于冷，也不可過于熱。普通有這温度，身上的黴菌，就能齣消滅了。所以當入浴的時候，先把全身浸熱水五分鐘，使身上的汚海與附着皮膚的黴菌，吸收熱水，那末再用絲爪經或粗布一擦，容易把身上的垢汚洗去。但是洗浴時，面部千萬不可洗，深恐身體上或浴缸裏的齷龊東西，傳染到限耳鼻口裏去。</p>

<h3>美棉救濟案難望照案通過</h3>
<p>紐約二十四來電報告一週中之棉市云、上週棉市以多頭了結而轉反動、人心頗形不定、緣農田救濟案未布把握、該案雖經衆院通過、但在參院中恐被裁割、南方賣出極少、且以同業買進及空頭抵補、致跌價亦受限制、惟别一方面需要亦屬有限、棉作在中東　帶均有延緩之報告、但佔大西洋各州及西南方面均有較佳之進行、則關於棉田意見一時仍羅得具體之表示、因須待農田救濟及田畝限制之發展、而予以農作物之貸欵也、衆院之通過農田救濟案、未足令人驚異、預料參院中必受挫折、該處勢心予以修改、故有若干專家以爲　　蜜斯氏之計畫、　　　　　　　　錄週末統計　左、（單位千包）</p>

<p>廠方不限價抛出</p>
<h3>標粉跌勢甚猛</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、尙未呈特殊大變動、因洋麥報價、芝坎兩處、互有一角之上落、故開價時、人心尙定、惟以後各盤、因阜豐陸續暢出、數額頗多、近期又因客帮之咽出、致市氣一致疲滯、步步鬆動、迨至下午開盤、忽見巨大之跌風、因各廠未抛之籌碼、實覺龐大、故福新阜豐及各小廠、均一致抛售、不限市值、半個月之擯局、遂爲打破、因賣氣之狂、跌風遂亦巨大、且中途又傳紐絲　洋麥、曾定成三千噸、定價廉至三兩三錢四分、因此人心尤　、步步回跌、一無反顧、五六七月份均低至一兩七錢零五厘之間、與去年之低盤、已相接近、後步如低廉之洋麥再定、市面當不堪設想矣、結果本月份較前日暴落二分、、四月份至七月份各跌三分、八月份跌三分半云、</p>
<h3>期麥受粉市牽掣</h3>
<p>忍痛出檔……小去二三分</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份變動雖微、人心已經不振、因抛售見暢、受戶甚少、所謂相形見絀、遂見疲滯、迨至下午開盤、均見一致暴落、因粉市之暴落、市氣已難復擯、後因行家之定貨、陸續暢出、如呆存不動、將來之風險甚大、所以均忍痛出檔、遠期各月份、遂步跌不已、結果本月份較前日跌二分四月份跌三分、五六月份無比較、七月份跌四分、八月份跌七分云、</p>
<h3>杜沙荳存厚不振</h3>

<p>據博士說：「日本軍閥在中國暴行所造成之仇恨，到今日已頗難消除」，「而日本决不能用暴力征服中國」，（見報載胡適之最近談話，下同）。道是值得憂慮的：難道眞的没有方法征服中國嗎？不，法子是有的。「九世之仇，百年之友，均在覺悟不覺悟之關頭上，」！「日本只有一個方法可以征服中國，卽懸崖勒馬，澈底停止侵略中國，反過來征服中國民族的心。</p>
<p>這據說是「征服中國的唯一方法。」不錯，古代的儒敎軍師，，總說「以德服人者王，其心誠服也」。胡適博士不愧爲日本帝國主義的軍師。但是，從中國小百姓方面說來，這却是出賣靈魂的唯一秘訣。中國小百姓實在「愚昧」，原不懂得自己的民族性」，所以他們一向會仇恨。如果日本陛下大發慈悲，居然採用胡博士的條陳，那末，所謂「忠孝仁愛信義和平」的中國固有文化，就可以恢復：！因爲日本不用暴力而用軟功的王道，中國民族就不至於再生仇恨，因爲没有仇恨，自然更不抵抗，因爲更不抵抗，自然就更和平，更忠孝……中國的肉體固然買到了，中國的靈魂也被征服了。</p>
<p>可惜的是這「唯一方法」的實行，完全要　日本陛下的覺悟。如果不覺悟，那又怎麽辦？胡博士回答道：「到無可奈何之時，眞的接受一種恥辱的城下之盟」好了。那眞是無可奈何的呵丨因爲那時候「仇恨鬼」是不肯走的，這始終是中國民族性的汚點，卽爲日本計，也非萬全之道。</p>
<p>因此，胡博士準備出席太平洋會議，再去「忠告」一次他的日本朋友：征服中國並不是没有法子的，請接受我們出賣的靈魂罷，何况這並不難，所謂澈底停止侵略」，原只要執行「公平的」李頓報告，丨仇恨自然就銷除了！</p>
<h3>北四川路</h3>
<p>— 馬國亮</p>
<p>年紅燈，中國銀行，湯白林，色白大菜，汽車，紅的綠的人，魚生及第粥，肉絲炒麵，月宫跳舞場，恒昌洋服店，一九三三年新裝，價錢最公道，新雅茶室，上海大戲院，英宫秘史……世界十大名片之一……</p>
<p>北四川路上半段還是這麽的熱鬧，亂烘烘的滿馬路都是人，才過了上海大戲院，往下便是那麽的冷悄悄的，黑沉沉的，好像上面的人啦，車啦……一到這裏便繪鬼掩了眼睛似的，個個都轉因頭，不再往下跑，下面就那麽的突然冷靜起來。</p>
<p>幸而我的眼睛不曾給鬼掩了，我還看見前面的路，我便一直朝黑暗裏跑。</p>
<p>兩三輛没有人坐的黄包車遲鈍地被慢慢地拖着，在昏弱的燈光下彷彿認到有人走動時，空的車子像賽跑似的拚命迎上去，油布的車篷碰出了拍拍的聲音。</p>
<p>標準鐘右邊，給一二八的砲火掃平了的荒地上的亂沙石堆，蹲着幾個年輕的孩子，大槪是剛賣完了晚報的，裝出了成人似的老練的樣子，吸着烟，搶着說什麽什麽……</p>
<p>怪丨我心頭跳了一跳丨這，可不是影片「生路」裏的幾個孩子變成眞的活人從銀幕跳了出來！但隨即我又嘲笑自己的没腦袋，「生路」裏面的孩子不早已跑到工廠裏去，而且完成了一段鐵路了麽！祗有我們的孩子才有這樣的福氣，隨地亂跑，没人管，也没人理會，愛吸烟使吸烟！</p>
<p>賣餛飩的在大德里口走動着，敲着手上的竹梆子，嘴裏喊着「餛飩麵！」伸長脖子望望住在樓上的人們。但是，上面却黑沉沉地，空手變不出戲法，上面依然没有一點動靜，嗤！賣餛飩的拉下了一把鼻涕，「餛飩麵！」竹梆子托托地響，聲音在冷靜的街心震蕩着，使人聽到了心裏發抖！</p>
<p>三個日本兵，十足地模仿着美國式的酒醉的步履，顚顚斜斜地從後面跌着走來，從身邊擦過，經過一間小食店門前，靠近的一個一掌推跌了那擺在門口的木牌，又吹嘘着向前走。這就是所謂大和民族的武士道氣槪罷，我想。</p>
<p>沉重的步聲漸漸在我前面消失，寳興路口也退在後面，横浜橋下的泥潭反映着上面凄凉的月色。更加冷寂了。人們都睡了罷。是的，很久以前早昏睡地。然而總有一個醒來的明天罷，終有一個跳起身來的　天罷。</p>
<p>日本小學堂的一幢高房子，像個傲慢的巨人，冷冷地站在路邊。一二八的怒吼不曾把牠擊碎，但是將來總逃不掉那一個更大的怒吼的罷，我一壁想，兩條腿依舊往前拔。更靜了呢！像個墳墓似的丨眞的是一個墳墓呀，一二八的第二天早上，我便是從這墳墓爬出來，經過了許多血淋淋的刺刀，逃出了我底性命的！</p>
<p>再往下走，更覺到孤寂了，猛然想起上半段的輝煌的北四川路，心裏眞有點不相信剛才的眼睛了。馬上轉個身回頭便跑，一口氣跑到上海大戲院門前，眼前登時便一亮，人和車子依舊這麽亂糟糟地，年紅燈，紅的綠的人……湯白林……</p>
<p>我又掉轉頭向後跑，面前依舊是這樣的一片荒凉，和黑暗！信不信由你，反正頭上不曾另外多生了一對眼睛。</p>
<p>那邊是鈔票，狂蕩，歡笑，享樂，享樂，和享樂；這裏是一片的零落，一片的黑暗，夾着痛苦的嘆息。你瞧，朋友，慢說别的，一條北四川路就有兩個世界！</p>
<p>那邊的笑聲流不到這裏來，這裏的嘆息那邊也聽不到的。</p>
<p>等着瞧罷，我想。再没有走出去的勁兒，我便轉入了那藏在黑暗裏的我底寓所裏。</p>
<p>可怕的漆黑！我探首到窗外望望，吐了吐舌頭。但當我跳上了床的時候，我立刻安慰自己：</p>
<p>跳躍在火山旁邊的人們不會永久的；明天太陽一出來，這裏也會亮起來的！</p>
<h3>雅人</h3>
<p>— 張天翼</p>
<p>據說人有雅俗之分，又凡物皆有新舊之别，所以有一種舊的雅人，也有一種呌做新的雅人。。舊的雅人對風花雪月吟吟五個字七個字一句的東西，彈彈七弦琴，頑頑女人，玩玩骨董字畫，或者還抽抽大烟，等等。新的雅人則對夜鶯玫瑰之類做功夫，寫寫分行句子，畫畫油畫，彈彈洋琵琶，躺在「愛人」的膝腂上溜一回嗓子，或者睡那麽一覺，等等。花樣繁多，不勝備載。</p>
<p>新舊雅人的花樣雖然不同，但雅的條件是一樣的。雅人必須是個讀書人，比一般人懂得多些，你要是没錢繳學費和制服費（許多學校裏，學生不繳制服費就得被除名的，）你就莫想當雅人。第二，是要超世俗的。據說雅人都「不事生産，」也管不着世上熙熙攘攘那些麻煩勁兒，並討論厭熱辣辣的政治。</p>
<p>然而眞古怪：雅人做出來的俗事竟比俗人的要高明得多。我們古來的那些雅人，都和達官公卿混得很好。連那位雅得幾乎没有人間烟火氣的謫仙，也要捧捧闊老，還做宫廷裏的「供奉」，給皇帝老子消遣。至於像那位不希罕五斗米而「歸去來」的陶先生之流，總算是例外，但那是因爲他有「田」可「歸」之故。</p>
<p>這說的是舊的雅人。</p>
<p>至於新的雅人呢，除了幾個新式「供奉」之外，其餘都是「我生不辰」：没有「知己」。因爲現在「新人物」太多了。没人賞識。那麽「歸去來」吧，可是鄉下連年天災人禍地鬧蹩扭，無「田」可「歸」。而且更糟糕的是，帝國主義不斷地對我們轟大砲，擲炸彈，大家正要和牠拚命。這雖是俗事，然而性命交關，一個不留神，連雅命也難保。</p>
<p>然則怎麽辦呢？有這麽幾條路：</p>
<p>一，雅得新舊參半，以求「知己」。</p>
<p>二，只歎歎氣，不作别事。</p>
<p>三，出一種新的救國論。因爲獃在象牙之塔裏，把藝術弄得高明些，也可爲國增光呀。</p>
<p>除第二種略嫌消極之外，其餘兩種是旣保持了雅人的身份，又切實用，是很合式的。</p>
<h3>蘧廬絮語</h3>
<p>— 子展</p>
<p>（十）（一）文章公式</p>
<p>日前見自由談載郁達夫先生說文章公式一文，因而憶及十七年前，予新執致鞭之一段趣事。予嘗謂今之士人無事可做，始降而敎書，敎書復無專長，始降而敎國文。倘借用昔友禮吾先生之恒言，所謂低能兒也者，國文敎師屬此輩，斷斷無疑，予其一也。予弱冠弄粉條，得與老師宿儒同列，挾冊登壇，意氣若不可一世。惟予之年事最輕，同列者亦恒以是輕之。予閱諸生文卷兩次，即發見全班通用之文章公式一種：</p>
<p>人生於世……何也蓋……由是觀之……豈不……哉……嗚呼……</p>
<p>試以今人之所謂革命爲題，套人公式：</p>
<p>人生於世，不可不革命，何也？蓋人而革命，小之則容易謀事吃飯，大之則不難升官發財。然今之所謂革命，中庸之事也；不偏之謂中，不激之謂　，中庸之爲德至矣乎！是故太革命，則爲惡化，難免不殺人放火。太不革命，則爲腐化，又不免老朽昏庸。得乎其中，斯爲革命；旣革命矣，斯爲同志；同志而最忠實，斯可以爲偉人矣。由是觀之，凡今之人，莫如革命。革命而欲偉其所謂偉，豈可不先忠實其所謂忠實也哉？嗚呼，此中忠實同志之所以日多，而革命之所以成功也。</p>
<p>總之，任何論題，皆可套入此一公式。當時予因戲製横額及一聨語榜之於門：</p>
<p>嗚呼</p>
<p>人生於世何也蓋</p>
<p>由是觀之豈不哉</p>
<p>並戒諸生曰：凡作文犯此十六字者，罰令重作，再犯須自打手心。全校大譁，予幾以是避席他去。卒賴二三老同學爲之辯解，是免排擯。然最後此一文章公式，諸生亦相戒不敢復用矣。</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路</h3>
<p>— 張貫平</p>
<p>「但　是不可能的。道不　侮　了女性，而且也是一種　　的表現。」</p>
<p>他决意走了。因爲曹夫人的示威運動實在太厲害了。他好幾次想要起身，但覺得下面的雙腿只是軟　　的立不起來。他仍然像飢餓着般的再偷看了一下曹夫人的粉白色的胸部。</p>
<p>他知道他自己是站在岔路上了。他不能放棄像佩珠那樣的崇高和清風。但同時又覺得欲　治自己目前的寂寞的情懷，唯有向鶴子夫人一類的女性追求些不可思　的安慰。</p>
<p>「你有甚事情要和世　說的？……我知道了，你們都不是好東西！你倆一定預先約　了有什麽鬼秘的行動，事來　着我啊！林先生，阿曹已經夠喜　玩那一道的，你再來　着他出去玩，我眞是不能答應的！……男女是平權的！男人丢開了妻子可以在外面另找姘頌，那末，做妻子的也可以自由行動了！林先生，你想對不對？」</p>
<p>曹夫人的說話眞是一波未平，又奇峯突起了。於是他不能不和她辯　了一會。　爭論得没法開交時，忽然聽見樓梯響了，有一陣咚咚的音響。</p>
<p>「老林，你來了？是怎樣的一陣風把你吹了來的？」</p>
<p>他們又重　的爲男女性　　際的問題爭論了　久，不覺　　過　　點了。因爲海泉帮着曹世光和曹夫人爭辯，她說要罰他請吃飯。海泉當然答應了。聽見海泉允　了她的要求，她又喜歡得小孩子一樣，趕忙匀臉及換穿衣服。</p>
<p>二十九</p>
<p>秋英聽見了海泉託世光找亭子間，想搬過來和他們在同一條弄堂裏住，非常的高興起來。</p>
<p>「林先生再等幾天吧。我們那裏的亭子間就要空出來了。不是快要　年假了麽？住在亭子間裏的學生就要回家去了的，他早向二房東退了房子。二房東還託了我替他介紹熟人來往。只七塊錢喲，包電燈，便宜得狠。」</p>

<h3>法意衝突之極度尖銳化巴黎通信（二月廿五日）</h3>
<p>莫索里尼實行反攻</p>
<p>小協約國團結鞏固</p>
<p>人們嚴重地極言戰爭危險</p>
<p>法蘭西勢力範圍下的聨合國、與法西斯的國家意大利·匈牙利·德國間、他們的衝突、無日不在繼續不斷地尖銳化中、衝突的中心點、前後一樣、一方面在武斷地否認「法西斯三角同盟」、另一方面則堅决地肯定有「法西斯三角同盟、」之存在、莫索里尼在閣議席上曾極力聲明、「關於締結意匈德同盟的消息、簡直是無中生有、如果外交委員會没有提及此事、則此種消息、直無加以否認之必要、「莫索里尼同時發表一篇論文、註明是在羅馬寫的、以便大家知道論文的作者是誰、莫索里尼在這篇論文中、以從未有過的嚴厲態度、攻擊法國、他說、法國這種無矣復加的造謠的嘗試、無異公開地破壞和平、法國散佈此種有毒的空氣、使歐洲各國人民陷於混亂和不安之狀態、誰還會相信法國眞正愛護和平呢、實際上法國是不肯裁軍、但是爲避人耳目計、固意搆出萊因河畔和亞爾平山秘密同盟和戰禍的空中樓閣、誰也没威嚇法國、只有法國以其盡量加大的軍備、他的自私自利、他的完全不知道其他民族之需要、他的同盟者和他的被軍用工業收買的報紙、威嚇歐洲和全世界、</p>
<p>這彷論文、乃是火上加油、這種挑戰的論調、自然會在法國引起意料中的反響、但在德國也引起了很多的評論、斯都奈蓋耳將軍的法西斯報、「柏林人」好像小學生似的、見他的哥哥駡人駡得痛快、也非常的高興、</p>
<p>「這裏至少是以半官式的發言　揭破了法國是和平之破壞者、是大陰謀家、是殘忍的政客、莫索里尼論文中所用的語調、是最銳利没有的了、戰後歐洲國與國之間、自從没有用過這樣嚴厲的語調、就是以前的協約國也還没有用過、由於現時法國極力煽動的結果、造成籠罩着羅馬和巴黎的暴風雨情緒、莫索里尼的說話、便　是這種暴風雨情緒的表現、」</p>
<p>不錯、這種說話、乃是暴風雨情緒的表現、而且所謂暴風雨者、即是將來新的世界戰爭、現在已經不止下戰書而已、即實際行動、足以暴露戰爭危險之嚴重性者、亦在在皆是、</p>
<p>在法國的保護國中間、「小協約國」各國的團結更形鞏固、羅馬利亞、南斯拉夫、捷克、必須共同行動、并建立共同的「經常委員會」以資領導、無疑義的、這種新條約是有政治的意義的、這自然是以反對意匈德企圖變更歐洲勢力範圍的努力爲目標的、「柏林人」關於此點寫道、</p>
<p>「昨天關於小協約國之密切團結的消息、同樣能不影響到歐洲政治之進展、這種團結明白是反對意大利、匈牙利和德國的、這種團結是法國最後的一次嘗試、法國只想把捷克與經濟上財政上俱已破産的羅馬利亞及被内部風潮所威脅的南斯拉夫再團結起來、使爲凡爾賽和「安樂宫」（也在凡爾賽、爲一九一九年匈牙與協約國成立和約之地）之守衛、」</p>
<p>在貝爾格勒（南斯拉夫首都）和布加勒斯特（羅馬利亞首都都很嚴重地計算着戰爭的來臨、某報維也納通信、說「…歐洲東南部的情緒、日益惡化、人們以爲戰爭的到來、好像就是明天的事了、」</p>
<p>瓦賽（波蘭首都）的情緒也是一樣、最近議會中的辨論、很明白地顯出政府黨、丨從社會民主黨假反對派一直到右派丨都表現出戰爭的情緒、</p>
<p>法國的勢力、在最近幾個星期中、無疑義地是大加擴大了、因爲波蘭怕德國進攻、南斯拉夫怕意大利進攻、法國政府遂利用這個機會、把已經有此靠不住的「格定根·撒朗尼基路你」得新鞏固起來、</p>
<p>法國政府在這種努力上、並没有表現出甚麽出奇的手腕、法國政府所得到的勝利、差不多都是不勞而獲的、</p>
<p>在亞爾平山南北許多挑戰的演說和論文中、時常反覆問着、這些政府都是在誰的帮助下建築起來的、還是在英國帮助之下的麽、裁軍會議上英國政府的態度就是警告、英國　　　愛藤提議在開羅公約上加上一條新條文（無論如何不許在武力中求得衝突之解决）這種提議只是想把會議暫時延宕下去的一種嘗試、佛朗弗特報（二月十六日）發表一篇倫敦通信、衔指出英國不相信法國已有戰爭危險之存在、以便後來得出下面的結論、</p>
<p>「最近英國政府改組的時候、倫敦有些人一相情願、以爲德國對外政策、不會變動、星期快報的一篇談話、便完全打破了這種空想、此外凡是留意政治的人、都必須指出德國因爲新政府對内策略改變的結果、在英國政界中、極可驚地失却她的基礎、」</p>
<p>德轼法西斯派旣然得不到英國的帮助、他們可能得到蘇聨的帮助呢、像柏林人一類的法西斯的政府報、極力宣傳、好像希特勒政府之反共産主義的對内政策、對於與蘇聨的關係、絶對不生影響似的、佛朗弗特報（二月十四日）則與之相反、她很憂慮地肯定法國在不斷地努力成立法國與蘇聨間的較密切的關係、</p>
<p>「當然不能說、法國政府直接地有與蘇聨締結軍事同盟的目撤查但是法國政府、却很努力謀東方的穏定、在某種情形下、即締結一定的軍事協定亦所不辭的、蘇聨地位每小時都在前進、如果以前德國和蘇聨有關係的話、那現在便可以說、這種關係現在完全消滅了、内閣總理打倒共産主義的目標、對於法國獲得蘇聨的努力、大有帮助、這是自然的事、」</p>
<p>佛朗弗特報實行反對戰爭危險的運動、已歷一星期之久、這是德國一部分資産階級的要求、這部分資産階級很駭怕帝國主義的資産階級、冒險一戰、將使德國資本主義比一九一八年冒更大的危險、該報指出戰爭危險並重覆聲言「此地（巴黎）根據已有的徵象、人們都嚴重地極言戰爭的危險、這是很可怕的、但是不能不說的」</p>
<p>對的、巴黎、馬賽、卜拉格、貝爾格勒布加勒斯特以及羅馬不達彼斯特、柏林、都有戰爭危險、而且戰爭危險與日俱長、</p>

<p>前線戰况甚佳　至前線戰况、邇來情形甚佳、因軍隊多具必死决心、處處能以極少數之兵力、截敵出於不意、曾有一大刀隊兵士、連砍十敵人、以致受傷、至前線接濟、因交通不便、事實確多困難、但後方總須决定根本辦法、以予接濟、最近宋哲元之軍隊作戰、在戰事緊急之時、糧食之運送前線、完全係由當地居民運輸云云、</p>

<p>女職員生活專号（中）痕</p>
<p>葉餘漫談</p>
<h3>「織補」者的話</h3>
<p>— 雉</p>
<p>在付印的五分鐘前，把本期編就的稿件字數一算，尙差四百五十字，自然，這需要我們編者來加以「織補」了。</p>
<p>有幾位讀者來信向我們徵求對於改良女工和女職員生活的意見，這使我們有些爲難了：</p>
<p>第一，在現在一提起職工就會使人聨想到「左傾」和「右傾」的時代之下，說話是很不容易的。你至少先要把話放在天秤上稱過之後，纔可以說，否則，你不是犯了「尾巴主義」或「左傾幼稚病」之譏，便是有人要說你是個「時代的落伍者」了！</p>
<p>第二，世界經濟恐慌普遍化的結果，使一般勞苦大衆的生活日趨貧窮化。一切的胡佛聖人和一切的麥克唐諾爾，雖想盡種種改良與救濟的方法，而對於失業問題以及其他的民生問題，仍不能有絲毫的解决，則不才如我們區區編者，更是不必說了。班門弄斧，我知免矣！</p>
<p>總之，女職工欲解救自身的痛苦，只有返求諸自己，只有靠自己不斷的努力奮鬥，别人是不能代庖的。况女職工從自身生活鬥爭的經騐中所得來的社會科學，眞要比我們編者天天坐在圖書館裏所得來的要豐富得多，正確得多呢！　　讀者諸君！你們要知道如何改良生活的妙訣嗎？我告訴你們，請你們還是去問問大人先生們罷！</p>
<p>大衆生活</p>
<h3>牢獄</h3>
<p>— 逸玲女士</p>
<p>電話公司女接線生</p>
<p>我從前曾在某埠某租界電話公司裏當過接線生，對於這種職業，有許多女子非常羨慕，以爲我們過的是一種怎樣幸福的生活。但這是因爲她們不知道其中内幕的情形，她們更不知道我們是在那裏受着怎樣的痛苦和侮辱呢！</p>
<p>我們的工作時間雖没有像工廠女工一樣的多，可是我們每天要做着七小時以上被監視的工作。我們一跑進公司裏來，就覺得好比進了牢獄一般。我們一天到晚像機器一般的工作着，一分鐘也不能偷懶，一天遲到五分鐘就得扣除半天的工錢。在我工作着的這間接線間裏，共有七八個外國女Ｆour　Nine　Nine和十幾個中國女Ｆour　Nine　Nine。Ｆou　Nine　Nine者就是監察員之謂。她們猶如工廠中的工頭，整天的四處巡視　，看見了有誰在偷懶，或者誰在說話，她們就來譴責你，或者告訴大班。大班就立刻呌了你去，大大的敎訓你一頓，</p>
<p>我們的大班是一個高而瘦的美國婦人。她是很嚴厲的。她的座位在中央，四面環顧，監視着我們。她的檯上有一個聽筒。她的聽筒和我們接線生的不同，但和普通電戶聽筒一樣。不過她的聽筒有着特别的妙用。她把聽筒放在耳邊時，我們幾百個人中有誰在說話，她就能立刻曉得是第幾號檯在說話。有一次有一位同事和外面一個男子談幾句話，恰巧大班這時正聽着聽筒，她聽見了，就立刻站起來和鼠子一般的偷偷地走到那同事背後　兩手放在她雙肩上狠狠地一拉，把那同事嚇了一跳。那同事轉過身來，見是大班，連臉都紅了。大班問她在做什麽，又把她呌過去，當着衆人把她痛駡了一塲，末了還操着蹩脚的上海話說：「當心，當心！」</p>
<p>這兒是帝國主義一種賺錢的機關，是帝國主義施用榨取剝削手段的最好榜樣。雖則我們每月只有一二十元的薪水，但在這兒工作，告假是要扣工錢的：告半天假要扣全天工錢：一天假扣三天工錢；病假扣半天工錢，而且還要經過指定的醫院的證明。</p>
<p>還有一件事最令人痛心的就是大小</p>
<p>業餘咖啡座</p>
<h3>女店員和打胎</h3>
<p>— 無文伯</p>
<p>因爲我學的是醫學，所以我在法租界掛牌做個婦科專門醫生。有一次我給一個患肺病很重而不宜生育的×公司女店員打了一次胎，從此以後便有許多女店員來商量這個問題了。可是從前我爲了打胎，曾成過刑事被告人。法官駡我說：你說女工不打胎便不能工作，不工作便没有飯吃，况這胎還不滿三個月，打下來對於大人毫無危險，所以給她打的；但那是蘇聨的法律，不是中國的法律。因此我坐了三個月的牢。此後遇有女店員來和我商量這件事時，我便拒絶說：這一次給他生罷，生了個小寳寳也很可愛的。你要下一次不生，我倒可以想法子，你早些來商量好了。可是她們都是抱定了「這一次要想法子，下一次且不必管牠」的宗旨，而且因爲我的診所還比較的清潔，而取費又很小，所以依然還有人來商量的。</p>
<p>從我這老醫生看起來，女店員們雖說都是在經濟上能獨立的職業婦女，不過等到她們一旦有了愛人，身邊若没有我來干涉，不久愛的結晶在她們腹中作起怪來，那就要感到自己究竟不及富家小姐那樣的自由，東忙西尋，找不到解决了。這是因爲經濟上獨立的職業婦女，事實上還没有獨立，公司給她們的薪水是要她們多做幾件美麗的衣服，襯托她們的色相，以廣招徠，不是給她們的眞薪水，公司也决不肯供給她們産前産後一切的費用，所以她們的生活和女工的實在也差不了多少。這無怪她們都要這樣的問我：「那麽，我肚子裏的東西怎麽辦呢？」可是我也只好這樣的回答她們：「小姐，借那個禁錮我三個月的我國法官的話，請你到蘇聨去罷！」</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>便也要受限制。小便時要報告Ｆour　NineNine。時間只許五分鐘，大便也只許五分鐘！從工作的檯跑到樓梯口，從樓梯口跑到二樓厠所便佔了二三分鐘，五分鐘的限度實在是不夠的。如果有人因身體不適，多去厠所幾次，大班便又要把她呌去問話了。而在二樓的大班和外國職員呢，她們旣不要跑樓梯，而時間又不受限制。但她們無論是誰，進去厠所一次，却總是十多分鐘。這大槪是因爲她們在生理上的構造是有些與我們不同之處吧！</p>
<p>我這樣辛苦地工作了三年，直至後來公司裝了自動機，而一二八戰事又在此時發生，公司趁我們逃難的機會把我們辭退了，以免我們要求失業補償費。這樣，我的接綫生生活也就此告終了。　的說　，那隻右手想來握我的左手。</p>
<p>「先生規矩些，還要吃什麽？」我給他一個釘子碰。</p>
<p>「看你不出，架子怪大的，好，隨便拿什麽來，威士忌，三民治，白脫士司……隨你拿來，好在你少爺袋裏有的是大拉。」他有些老羞成怒，想把錢來壓倒人家，可是我仍是給他一個冷淡。</p>
<p>但是這樣的事，給老班知道了。他說我得罪顧客，對於他的生意上會發生影響的，所以承他諄諄的敎訓了我一番。他說：</p>
<p>「顧客是出錢來吃東西的，不是來買氣受的。他有的是錢，我們要的也是錢。他問你幾歲，你就對他說幾歲。他要握你摸你，你就讓他握握摸摸，也没有什麽大不了。不然，你整塊錢整塊錢</p>

<p>編輯先生：謝謝你，可不可以請你把我這封信發表了呢？</p>
<p>我是某政治機關裏的一個公務員，不過我身邊並没有帶衛隊，因爲一則我不是要人，二則我現在也算是「下野」了。現在我附奉一首詩和一幅畫，請你把詩登在這封信的前面，把畫登在後面。這些淺薄的作品，前呼後擁的，就作爲我的衛隊罷，只是要請你費一番工夫「檢閱」一下子昵！</p>

<h3>老板與貴客的聨合戰綫</h3>
<p>— 雲凌女士</p>
<p>女招待在咖啡室</p>
<p>在×××做了二十多天的女招待，人生的不平，什麽都嚐到了·下面寫的，就是在這二十多天中所經歷到的一件事。</p>
<p>皮鞋聲在樓梯上「角角」的響着，進來一個身上穿着華美的西裝，臉上擦着雪花膏，頭上塗着司丹康的靑年來。這是意識告訴我的，須得上前去招待他。</p>
<p>「先生，請這裏坐，吃些什麽？」爲着要解决衣食問題，不得不忍辱來幹這變相的賣笑生涯！女招待，去侍候這般少爺流氓。</p>
<p>「朱來杯咖啡！」</p>
<p>這靑年一面喝着，一面儘是對着我望，一會兒又獨自發笑。「你姓什麽？」他問我。</p>
<p>「姓×。」我簡單的回答他。</p>
<p>「照會生得怪漂亮的，今年幾歲了？」這傢伙不識相的進一步問我。我見他賊眼灼灼的不懷好意，所以没有睬他。</p>
<p>「聽見麽？我問你今年幾歲了？」可憐他連杯中的咖啡已没有了，也不知道，還想把杯往嘴裏　。</p>
<p>「先生，還要什麽吃？」我正眼不覷的問他。</p>
<p>「……要吃你嘴上的紅…」他賊忒嬉的小賬從什麽地方來？要是我店裏用的人，都像你一樣的得罪顧客，我這店豈不要連鬼也不來上門嗎？你想想，我們的店豈不是要關門。要是關了門，你的比月薪大幾倍的小賬，到那裏去賺？所以我勸你，你以後别要這樣傻，他們要呌你怎麽樣，你就依他們怎麽樣，摸摸握握反正你也不見得有什麽損失……」</p>
<p>「是的，我是傻的，我幹不來這樣没廉恥的事，我不能讓他們任意調笑，我源嶶他們獻媚。」我不等老班再說下去，就乾脆的這樣回答他。</p>
<p>「你在我這裏做女招待，總要這樣做的。你若不做，那麽請你另圖高就，幹你願意幹的去！」他拿歇生意來壓迫我。</p>
<p>我不響，眼淚像雨一般的流了下來。</p>
<h3>他們的「正動」和我的「反動」</h3>
<p>— 愛蓮女士</p>
<p>某政治機關女職員</p>
<p>每天早上看報成了習慣的我，有一天突然發現了一段：「某大機關招請女職員二人，薪金二十五至三十五元；中學以上程度，皆可報名，……」的廣告。當然，我是一個受過大學敎育的人，程度已及格了，而且又是用不着什麽照片的，所以我便大胆的寄了一張履歷表去。還不到三天，他們就寄了一張油印的通知書來，呌我到某處去應考。去的時候，我太高興了。的確，我很清楚，這是一個很有名，堂堂的政府機關，我有一位表兄曾打算去的，但是托的人物太小，所以失敗了，不料我反很容易的踏進了這個大鐵門。我所害怕的，就是考不取。待進了考塲，我更證明了我一定失敗了；因爲在七十多個應考的人中，我認識有兩個是某大學畢業生，還有一個是我母校的敎授。以我的學識來說，什九是無望的，而且我又没有托什麽人情！</p>
<p>來了二十多個監塲員，一齊站立着，其中一個人先發了幾句話，他說：我們人太多了，要改用口試。於是一個個的被呌到他們面前去問話。他們問些什麽話，我可聽不見，只看見那二十多人，每人手中在不停的記錄着，我也不明白他們在記着什麽。一個人的回答，用得着這許多人摘記嗎？後來，他們呌着我的名字了。所問的除了履歷上已有的一些以外，只多問了一句「結婚没有？」</p>
<p>很快的，第二天下午，就來了信。出乎任何人意料之外的，我是被取了。</p>
<p>我去了，我發見了另一個被取的，是和我年紀相彷彿的一個很美的人。她姓劉。薪金呢，說明了；她是二十五元，而我却有三十五元。由這時起，考試時的悶葫蘆還没打破，却又開始了另一段的神秘生活！</p>
<p>一星期過去了，我却連一件公事也没有辦過。我每天總帶着幾本小說去看，消磨七八小時的光陰。簽到簿上，我也没簽過，因爲他們說，女職員是不用簽到的。所以遲到早走，或竟至於不來，都没關係。只要有一個男同事没有事做的時候，他就會到我桌子旁來談天，眞是討厭死人！他們知道我喜歡看小說，所以我常常在抽屜裏，發現他們送給我的書。我又不知道那個人買的，退還給誰呢？這使我窘極了！再過幾天，彼此相熟了一點，他們又來請我吃飯，跳舞，看電影等等，我總是拒絶了。爲要避免他們來麻煩，所以每次回家，我總呌在海關作事的大哥來接我。於是一些男同事，有些恨我了。公事房裏，旣没有機會：下公事房時，又有我的哥哥在等候我，他們眞是無可如何。</p>
<p>劉女士呢，她坐在離我很遠的地方。我想她比我有見識，她知道處世的　戲謔的聲音，不時的傳到我耳邊來。下公事房後，也總有三兩個男同事和她同走。據說看電影是日常功課。跳舞夜餐，也平常得很。有一次竟和五位同事，在×旅館打了一夜的麻將牌。在她呢，也許是爲着生計問題不得不敷衍飯碗，安之若素。同時也可以利用很好的機會，尋自己的愉快丨不過，我總有些討厭她，所以也很少和她說話。她幾次請我去吃飯，雖然她聲明絶没有第三個人同去，但老是給我推托掉了！</p>
<p>進某機關後的第三個星期日上午，忽然劉女士到我寓所來訪我。雖然同事們來找我，我從來没接見過，但劉女士是女同事，第一次來，我不好意思擋駕，所以終於請了她進來。她向我發了一</p>

<h3>Lengkou to Become the Focus of Warfare</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops Hold Their Ground Awaiting Reinforcements</p>
<p>Fresh Troops Arrive at Banbishan</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Japanese Troops are Departing from Chengde</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News: The battles at various passes of the Great Wall have been quiet for days. Due to the failure of the attack on Xifengkou, the focus of the Great Wall battles has shifted to the Lengkou area. The enemy is determined to capture Lengkou and is currently awaiting reinforcements. A major battle is expected within days. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy forces on the Lengkou front retreated slightly after being ambushed by our troops from both flanks on the evening of the 24th. On the 25th, the remaining enemy troops were still holding their ground, awaiting reinforcements. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The main Japanese forces at Lengkou consist of the Okamura 40th Regiment of the Nakamura Mixed Brigade under the 10th Division, the Taniguchi 10th Artillery Regiment, and the Tani 5th Infantry Regiment of the Suzuki 4th Brigade under the 8th Division. In addition, a portion of the Hattori Mixed Brigade and the western part of the 8th Division have been drawn from the Japanese forces at Xifengkou to join the attack on Lengkou. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shen Ke telegraphed from Ping on the 24th, stating that after the enemy on the Luowenyu front was routed by our Liu Division, about 200 remnants, half Japanese and half Chinese, fled to the northeast of Xinglong County, where they were severely attacked by the local militia. They are in a very miserable state. The enemy at Banbishan damaged six aircraft, which are currently being repaired. Two enemy scouts were captured, and under interrogation, they confessed that the enemy has over 2,000 troops currently advancing towards our side from Chengde. A fierce battle is expected within days. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Frontline telegraphs report that over 2,000 enemy infantry troops, carrying over 20 artillery pieces, departed from Chengde on the 22nd and arrived near Banbishan on the 24th. On the morning of the 24th, the enemy fired over a hundred shells from Sanyikou towards our positions at Luowenyu, wounding seven of our soldiers. However, the newly arrived enemy reinforcements have not yet advanced. If they attack, they will be met with a severe blow. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telephone call from Zunhua reports that the situation at the front was extremely quiet this morning and last night. Apart from the Japanese troops continuously firing at our positions at Banbishan, Yumeiling, Mengziling, and other places, there were no fierce clashes. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The 29th Army's office in Beiping received a telegram from the front stating that the enemy outside Dongjiakou was attacked the night before by our [redacted] battalion, resulting in the burning of over 30 supply vehicles and the killing of over a hundred enemy soldiers.

The enemy at Tiemen bombarded us with artillery yesterday, but our troops remained calm and waited for their next move, without retaliating. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Resolves to Sacrifice Himself</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) This newspaper's reporter went to Xifengkou for inspection and met with Song Zheyuan on the 24th. According to him, the enemy's morale has been weakened due to repeated disastrous defeats, and they have retreated thirty to forty li to await reinforcements. He said that he has long been determined to resist Japan but had no opportunity. He is extremely pleased to have been transferred here this time. For anything to succeed, there must be a spirit of sacrifice. Without sacrifice, how can there be success? He holds the principle of "Success need not be mine, but sacrifice must be mine first" and will act accordingly. He is not concerned about anything else and vows to resist the enemy to the death. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Fail to Approach the Great Wall</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Second Army Corps announced this afternoon that this time our army's defense [redacted] did not adopt the method of directly defending the passes. Instead, it fought the enemy at a certain place 30 li north of the Great Wall, and [redacted] teams harassed the enemy far in front. Therefore, the enemy's 14th Division, which had been preparing in Dushan for many days, has been stuck in a certain position for three days since the 21st, despite using combined arms forces to launch fierce attacks, and has failed to approach the Great Wall by even one step. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Zhang HaiPeng's Troops Forced to Disarm</h3>

In addition, another enemy unit of two to three hundred advanced to Shiling at 8:00 AM on the 22nd and clashed with our cavalry and infantry at Dongshangzha. The enemy seems to have an active intention to attack us. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Eastern Jilin</p>
<h3>Volunteer Army's Momentum is Strong</h3>
<p>A Japanese Team Annihilated in Muling</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the eastern Jilin area, volunteer armies have risen up again and joined forces, totaling tens of thousands of people, with a strong momentum. It was previously reported that they would immediately attack Hulin. Upon hearing this, the Japanese side greatly strengthened its defenses and dispatched over 2,400 troops to garrison the area. At the same time, a small team of Japanese soldiers, about thirty people, was completely annihilated by the volunteer army about eight li east of Muling County in eastern Jilin. Since this incident occurred, the people have been in a state of panic. It is expected that the volunteer army's activities will be even more alarming after the green gauze tents are set up.

In the afternoon, another enemy plane flew to the northwest outside Miyun City and dropped six bombs. The extent of the damage is unknown.

The enemy forces stationed in Linyu are in an exposed position.

Our army is still on the front line. If the enemy invades, we vow to fight to the death. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Europe Will Convene a Conference of Four Powers</h3>
<p>MacDonald May Meet with Hitler</p>
<p>Reactions of Various Countries to the British Prime Minister's Diplomatic Remarks</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 25th – The German political circles welcome British Prime Minister MacDonald's speech in the House of Commons advocating the revision of the peace treaty. Newspapers expect that Britain and Germany will exchange views on the agreement proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and endorsed by MacDonald, and although its nature is difficult to predict, it is believed that a meeting between the British Prime Minister and the German Chancellor is not impossible. However, it is heard that preliminary negotiations will still be handled by ordinary diplomatic organs, and direct talks will be held after the thorns have been cleared, and then a four-power conference will be convened.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 24th – German political circles commented on Prime Minister MacDonald's speech in the House of Commons yesterday, calling it "very calm" and proving that France has rejected the four-power agreement proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Political observers, after reading MacDonald's speech, feel that its tone is very different from the optimism expressed by MacDonald in Rome.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 24th – French newspapers mostly criticized British Prime Minister MacDonald's statement in the House of Commons today on the results of his visit to Geneva, Rome, and Paris. For example, the Paris Echo said, "Encouraging retaliation will only encourage the dictatorships of Hitler and Mussolini to run rampant." French newspapers are deeply afraid that the steps taken by Britain and Italy will lead to the revision of the peace treaty, and French newspapers insist that France is not yet prepared for this. British Conservative member Churchill's statement that diplomatic affairs should be handled by ordinary diplomatic organs is very much opposed to MacDonald's continental negotiations, and France has greatly praised it.</p>
<h3>Airplane Adventure at the Summit of the World</h3>
<p>British Aviator to Depart from India Tomorrow</p>
<p>(National News, New Delhi, 25th) The Everest Aerial Exploration Team announced today that it will depart by plane on Monday to explore the summit of the world. It is expected that it will conquer the world's highest peak after three hours of flight. Everest is the highest peak in the Himalayas. This is the third aerial attempt. The peak is 28,000 feet high, and the aircraft must be at least 35,000 feet high to prevent various unexpected dangers.</p>
<p>Havas, Yugoslav Capital, 24th – British Prime Minister MacDonald's speech to the House of Commons yesterday shocked people here. In general, for the Little Entente countries, there is no such thing as revising the treaty, and Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant guarantees the territorial integrity of the signatory countries. It is also said that MacDonald's declarations in Rome, Paris, and London are quite different. What is MacDonald's true intention? It is hoped that he can say it clearly to avoid public confusion.</p>
<p>Reuters, Warsaw, 24th – The newly appointed Polish Ambassador to Italy, Botocki, has resigned today. It is said that Botocki's move is against the policy decided by the two countries during British Prime Minister MacDonald's talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the end of last week.</p>
<p>Disarmament Conference Begins Discussion</p>
<h3>The New MacDonald Plan</h3>
<p>Little Entente Expresses Acceptance in Principle</p>
<p>Turkey Also Demands Equality of Armaments</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 25th – The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference held a full-day meeting to discuss the procedural issues, but the opinions of all parties have not yet been determined. It is not known whether the General Commission will adjourn immediately or continue to review the MacDonald Plan chapter by chapter. Semi-official sources argue that the General Commission can conclude the debate and use the British Plan as the basis for a draft disarmament convention, but before discussing the detailed articles, there must be more detailed research among the governments of various countries, which is also recognized by official sources.</p>
<p>National News, Geneva, 25th – The general debate on British Prime Minister MacDonald's disarmament plan by the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference is expected to be extended to Tuesday next week. According to the current schedule, the committee will begin to discuss the details of the plan, and it may be completed before Easter. The committee's sudden acceleration of work is due to the proposal of Chairman Henderson. Henderson initially opposed rapid progress, believing that it was better to wait until the political atmosphere was slightly clearer and to pay particular attention to British Prime Minister MacDonald and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's efforts to promote the four-power understanding. However, Henderson's recent proposal is believed to be unable to benefit the British plan, because in the current situation, the British plan will eventually be shelved, like previous plans. It can be seen from the first day of debate that there was no real result, but only showed the contradictions in the opinions of the great powers.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 24th – This afternoon, the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference began to discuss the disarmament plan proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu spoke on behalf of the Little Entente countries, saying that the British plan could be used as a basis for discussion, that some of its articles could be recognized, that others needed to be revised, and that there were some shortcomings that needed to be supplemented. Swiss representative Motta said that the claims of the various countries were mutually different, and the British plan was nothing more than a compromise solution and left room for improvement. Representatives from the Netherlands, Hungary, and Turkey all praised the efforts of the British government, saying that its plan could give people new hope and was a significant advance. The Turkish representative mentioned the talks in Rome and Paris, saying that the Turkish government only learned about these matters from the newspapers, which was very strange, but that if effective decisions were to be taken, the entire body of the Disarmament Conference must reach a unanimous compromise. The Turkish representative also asked the General Commission whether, since the provisions of some treaties concerning land, sea, and air forces were to be abolished, the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne concerning the demilitarization of the Bosphorus Strait of Turkey should be dealt with in the same way. After the representatives of Norway and Denmark spoke, the Polish representative took the floor, raising only some questions concerning procedures, but reserving the right to speak in the general discussion. The General Commission is scheduled to continue the discussion tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 24th – This afternoon, British Foreign Secretary Simon arrived here by plane and immediately attended the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference. When the meeting was convened, the Turkish representative spoke, demanding that the principle of equality of armaments be extended to the demilitarized zone of the Bosphorus Strait. As a result, a new element was added to the discussion. It is expected that the general discussion will continue until Monday evening or Tuesday, after which the General Commission will decide whether to continue discussing the British plan chapter by chapter without interruption, or whether to postpone the discussion until after Easter. The issue of postponing various technical works of the Disarmament Conference is also likely to be raised at that time. (Note: The Treaty of Lausanne, signed by Turkey and the great powers in 1922, stipulates that demilitarized zones should be established on both sides of the Bosphorus Strait, the Dardanelles Strait, and certain islands.)</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th – British Foreign Secretary Simon flew from London to Geneva today to attend the discussion of the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference on the draft agreement proposed by the British Prime Minister last week. Because he was delayed on the way between Lyon and Geneva, Simon did not arrive at the meeting until after it had begun. The representative of the Little Entente, Titulescu, first began the debate on the convention, saying that the three Little Entente countries he represented were prepared to accept the British proposal as a basis for discussion, but reserved the right to propose amendments in the future. Swiss representative Motta also held the same attitude, saying that the British Prime Minister's plan had preserved the Disarmament Conference. Representatives from Norway, Turkey, and other countries spoke one after another, criticizing several of the proposed conventions. Norwegian representative Lange said that restrictions on the budget, supervision of arms manufacturing, the definition of aggression, and punishments for aggressor countries were all necessary provisions, but that this convention did not mention a single word, which was regrettable. Debate must continue tomorrow, and the debate will probably end on Tuesday.</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 25th – Because the new disarmament proposal put forward by British Prime Minister MacDonald has a great bearing on Japan, a joint meeting of the important departments of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs was convened at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:00 this morning to carefully deal with it and review the final instructions. After completion, the Japanese delegation in Geneva was immediately instructed by telegram to act accordingly.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 25th – Instructions will be sent to the Japanese delegation in Geneva, stating the attitude of the Japanese government towards the British disarmament plan. The statement (1) cannot recognize those who violate the Pact of Paris (Kellogg-Briand Pact) as actual aggressors; (2) cannot recognize the plan regarding the restriction of the army, because the military strength of Japan's neighbors, China and Russia, is currently unknown; (3) cannot recognize the suggestion for naval restriction, the attitude will be decided after the discussion of suggestion proposed by Japan on December 10th last year; (4) cannot recognize the plan for the restriction of the air force, because the development of Japanese aviation affairs is still comparatively backward.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 24th – Foreign Minister Pengu met with diplomatic reporters from the press today. Pengu said, "Based on my experience in Geneva for the past eight years, I am convinced that no matter whether political or economic conferences are held internationally, it is difficult to succeed without prior diplomatic preparation. Open discussions at international conference tables can only be the final scene of the work between the foreign ministries and embassies of various countries. To cite two examples, the difficulties encountered by the Disarmament Conference for the past year are only due to insufficient preparation and disputes between the opinions of various countries. If ways are sought to eliminate them in advance, the conference will be facilitated. Conversely, the reason why the Locarno Treaty was successful was because of the long preparation beforehand," and so on.</p>
<h3>President Madison Capsizes</h3>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>From North to South Darkens</h3>
<p>Japan's invasion of Northeast China encompassed four provinces, fully unleashing its military force to invade and expand territory, in order to conceal its internal ugliness and divert its people's domestic anger outward. In fact, Japan, calling itself a military nation, having utilized the old customs of feudal tradition, the so-called Bushido spirit, and further importing German militarism, the majority of Japanese people have been nurtured within this framework for the sixty years since the Meiji Restoration. The "national policy of one war every ten years" is especially regarded as a guideline by the army and navy. However, after the capitalist system has grown and matured excessively, the tools used for war and the actual underlying strength must be based on the nation's wealth and natural resources, and then a three-dimensional battle can be grasped. Japan's total national wealth is only 1.022 billion yen (only one-sixth of that of the United States), and the reserves of coal and iron are extremely scarce, with even rarer reserves of oil. Once an international war is provoked and maritime navigation is blockaded, it will be trapped in a predicament even before the outcome on the battlefield is decided. Therefore, taking advantage of our country's inadequate strength and lax national defense, it launched a sudden invasion of the Northeast and then trampled over Jehol, so that the deficiency in coal and iron could be obtained from the virgin land of the four northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>The militaristic Japan is not satisfied with exclusively swallowing the four northeastern provinces. If the countries still want to restore the international balance in the East and insist on the truly open-door policy in Manchuria, then the principle of the League of Nations has been discussed to the fullest extent. Japan's brutal advancement has not ceased, and thus a storm has suddenly arisen. The trusteeship of the three island groups of Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall north of the equator has become a problem due to Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. According to international common practice, since Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, the territories entrusted to it by the League of Nations should naturally be returned without any doubt. However, Japan has made many evasive arguments on this point. Its military believes that:</p>
<p>"...Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations does not解除 the entrusted governance of the South Seas... Moreover, in fact, (the South Seas islands) are the lifeline of Japan's national defense, so they must be firmly maintained..."</p>
<p>"...Regarding the issue of entrusted governance (of the two South Seas island groups), although there are various arguments from the perspective of international law, the most appropriate view now is that the sovereignty of the entrusted territory should belong to the five major Allied Powers. In other words, the sovereignty of the entrusted territory does not belong to the League of Nations. Moreover, my (Japan's) entrusted territory is a C-type territory, so it should be a part of Japanese territory and can be used for all kinds of facilities. Therefore, even after our country (Japan) withdraws from the League of Nations, there is absolutely no need to return it to the League of Nations, but only to submit an annual report on governance to the League of Nations..."</p>
<p>The so-called "national defense" and the so-called "lifeline" have actually been extended from north to south to the three island groups north of the equator. At the beginning of the conclusion of the Treaty of Versailles, the disposition of Germany's old colonies was handed over to the Allied Powers for trusteeship, and this trusteeship should be a peaceful trusteeship, which must not allow the trustee country to establish military defenses or use them as naval military fortresses for its own interests. However, since Japan has been entrusted with the governance of the three South Seas island groups, it has secretly built fortresses, and its construction costs have exceeded 15 million yen. From the Ogasawara Islands along the Mariana Islands to Palau, it forms an arc. What is the intention behind this? It goes without saying that it is aimed at the United States. The United States wants to actively develop the Far East, but its foundation is weak. The Philippines are isolated 6,000 nautical miles away. Although Hawaii is in the middle to provide assistance, how can the 4,000-mile sea voyage be expected to maintain close communication?</p>
<p>The islands of "Guam" and "Yap" are indeed important routes for communication between the United States and the Philippines. If the construction of the "Guam" fortress is completed, the naval base will be more convenient than Manila. However, restricted by the Washington Treaty and limited by the current financial resources of the United States, it has to be temporarily shelved. Therefore, Japan, which disregards international treaties and good faith, can secretly carry out its military construction. If a change occurs in the Pacific, it can rely on its geographical advantage to cut off the connection between the United States and the Philippines in a short period of time, so that our country will be entirely under its threat. Even if the United States has a strong navy and wants to fly over more than 5,000 miles of the Pacific Ocean to attack Yokosuka and other support points, it is feared that it will inevitably fall into the same fate as the Baltic Fleet in the era of the Russo-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Therefore, Japanese militarists took advantage of the international turmoil and uncertainty, the unrest in Europe, the unabated financial panic in the United States, and our country's inability to fight, to seize by trickery and turn peaceful trusteeship into armed rule, and have clearly stated that they will never let go, even recognizing the three island groups north of the South Seas equator as the lifeline of their national defense. Although the United States initially proposed exchange conditions at the beginning of the trusteeship, it can be said to have held the power of "consultant" in the treaty. In today's era of surging nationalism in Germany, it is naturally impossible not to intervene, but the road is long and the power is weak, which is not as convenient as the situation of Japanese imperialism. However, the control of the Pacific is a matter of life and death for the United States of America, and it is difficult to sit idly by and watch the development of the situation in the future. The dispute between Japan and the United States is more serious than the dispute between Japan and Germany, and it is feared that it cannot be resolved by past protests and debates.</p>
<p>Japan will tomorrow</p>
<h3>Announce its Withdrawal from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Privy Council will hold a plenary meeting at 10:00 a.m. on the 27th in the Imperial Palace to review the proposal to withdraw from the League of Nations. Regarding the handling of this proposal, after the meeting on the 22nd, the advisors have already approved the proposal. Therefore, the Japanese government expects that the meeting on the 27th will be passed. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will, in the name of Foreign Minister Uchida, send a telegram to League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, without going through the Japanese delegation or embassies abroad, and simultaneously announce it in the official gazette and a statement in Tokyo. The scope of withdrawal is limited to the League of Nations Assembly and the Council, and other agencies will remain neither close nor separate, leaving room for rejoining the League of Nations at a later date. (United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Senior statesmen, elders, and both Presidents Suzuki and Wakatsuki initially disapproved of the military's proposal to withdraw from the League of Nations, arguing for self-restraint. However, the military coerced them with force, so they reluctantly complied. It is heard that the Privy Council also expressed dissatisfaction with Uchida's diplomacy, believing that Uchida is only a puppet of the military and has no diplomatic skills. If Uchida and Araki continue to wield their military swords for diplomacy, not only will Europe and the United States become enemies, but even in the Far East, they will not be able to gain friendly allies. The so-called Asian League is nothing more than a fool's dream. Therefore, at the plenary meeting on the 27th, the following hopes will be attached to request the passage of the original proposal: (1) Active direct negotiations between China and Japan must be carried out to quickly ease the deadlock of confrontation; (2) Military diplomacy must be carried out selectively. The current situation requires the domestic economic panic to be resolved, and the only way to do this is to stop China's boycott of Japanese goods. The opinions put forward by the Privy Council clearly imply a demand for Uchida's resignation, because as long as Araki and Uchida are in the court, Sino-Japanese negotiations cannot proceed. (United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>South Seas Mandate Island Issue</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy's Strong Argument</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a Berlin dispatch, if the Japanese government withdraws from the League of Nations, the German government believes that the South Seas islands should be returned to the League of Nations, and substantively governed by the League of Nations, while formally hoping to return to Germany. It is rumored that preparations for negotiations have begun. The Japanese naval authorities have observed this as follows: According to Article 119 of the Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany, the German government clearly ceded the German colonies to the Allied and Associated Powers. Therefore, Germany's return to this, although acknowledging its negotiations with the League of Nations and the Allied Powers, but negotiations with Japan, one of the Allied Powers, are not permissible, and are not allowed by Japan. If Germany has this intention, it is feared that this is caused by internal relations, and even if the South Seas islands are returned to Germany, it is feared that Britain and France will fear Germany's expansion of military power and will oppose it. Even the United States may not agree. The policy of the imperial government will not be moved, and it will have the following reasons why Japan can still possess the South Seas islands even though it has announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations: (1) Long-term entrusted governance, which is in fact owned by the trustee country, has been formally and informally clarified in several League of Nations Assemblies and Entrusted Governance Committees; (2) The German government abandoned the sovereignty of the entrusted governance area in the Treaty of Versailles, so it has no right to speak on this; (3) Non-member states can be trustee countries, such as the United States being the trustee country for Armenia, which is a precedent.

<p>Matsuoka Arrives in New York</p>
<h3>Few Welcoming, Many Hating</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Mr. Lin Detained for Carrying a Handgun</p>
<p>(New York) Japanese representative to the League of Nations Matsuoka Yosuke arrived in New York today aboard the Leviathan. Matsuoka met with reporters on deck, with a rather warm attitude, but his answers to reporters' questions revealed a challenging tone. Only a dozen or so local Japanese residents went to the pier to welcome him, while more than fifty people holding flags to protest Japan's invasion of Manchuria held demonstrations. Matsuoka immediately declared to the reporters that Japan was not a vassal state of the United States and had no obligation to explain its activities. He then explained that Japan had suffered greatly due to misunderstandings from all sides and the lack of proper publicity, saying that the United States was 5,000 miles away and it was difficult to fully understand Japan's various actions in Asia, just as Japan also found it difficult to understand the United States' occupation of several countries in the Western Hemisphere. He then explained that Japan wanted to take necessary actions to avoid the rise of dangerous conspiracies against Japan in Manchuria. He then discussed the League of Nations resolution, saying that whether to withdraw or not must be decided by the Japanese government. Finally, he said that he had no special mission in the United States, but only wanted to meet old friends and explain Japan's policies and position in Manchuria. As for the demonstrators, it was heard that only one Chinese person named Lin was detained for carrying a handgun, while the remaining forty-nine people were searched at the pier and then released.

<h3>US Gold Embargo Lifted</h3>
<p>Washington dispatch from the 24th: Treasury Secretary Woodin told reporters today that the announcement regarding the gold embargo is currently being prepared and may be announced tomorrow. Woodin did not express the content of this announcement. When asked whether the gold embargo would be lifted through announcement procedures, Woodin replied that he thought so. There are many rumors in New York's financial circles, saying that the authorities have lifted the gold embargo and that it will be announced soon. However, New York's financial circles expressed doubts about the possibility of not allowing unlimited exports of cash. If the embargo is completely lifted, it is impossible to calculate how much gold will be exported, because in addition to the cash held by foreign central banks in the United States, the number of foreigners holding US bonds and other items is also very large. Moreover, if domestic people want to transport gold out of the country, it should not be difficult, as long as they contact foreign merchants and ask them to withdraw cash on their behalf. The Treasury Secretary's remarks to reporters have attracted significant attention on Wall Street. The financial circles are eagerly awaiting the announcement that may be issued tomorrow. According to some opinions, cash exports to repay actual commercial debts may be allowed to go through, but they must follow strict licensing procedures.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Washington, 24th: Senators who advocate maintaining the silver market expect that President Roosevelt will be sympathetic to them, so they are now preparing to re-promote the restoration of silver prices. In the next few days, Senator King will ask the White House to include at least three representatives related to silver in the delegation of the United States to the World Economic Conference. Senator Wheeler told guests that he would soon begin a campaign in the Senate to pass the silver bill with a ratio of sixteen to one. He believes that a legislative bill can be passed during the current congressional session to stabilize silver prices. He believes that passing the silver legislative bill is most appropriate today.</p>
<h3>German Dictatorship Implemented</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Berlin, 24th: President Hindenburg signed the Enabling Act today, which stipulates that the National Socialist government is granted dictatorial power for a period of four years. It was passed by the parliament yesterday and took effect today. Now the dictatorial power will first be applied to a certain state in western Germany, which may expel Jews from the country.</p>
<p>National dispatch from Berlin, 24th: The German government held a cabinet meeting today, which lasted for a long time. Economic Minister Hugenberg first represented all cabinet members in congratulating Prime Minister Hitler on his success in parliament. Then, Interior Minister Frick proposed a general outline of domestic policy plans, the purpose of which is to coordinate the work of the federal government and various state cities. According to some newspaper reports, the cabinet also considered the proposal to implement the death penalty for political prisoners.</p>
<h3>The Causes of the American Financial Panic (New York Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Stock Market Prices Plunge, People Heavily in Debt</p>
<p>Banks Unable to Circulate, All Industries Greatly Affected</p>
<p>The world's first rich and powerful country, the leader of capitalist countries, the United States of America, which absorbs 42% of the world's total cash, has now reached the point of suspending the gold standard, and 15 million unemployed workers are on the verge of starvation. Middle- and upper-class families have also lost the image of their former prosperous lives. Among the 30 million workers in the United States, only half are fortunate enough to have jobs. The wages and salaries of some have been reduced by 20%, and some have even been reduced by 70%. On average, the actual reduction is 56.5%. The golden age of stocks, that is, ordinary stock dividends, could maintain a very comfortable life, but now it has become a dream.</p>
<p>The total value of stock market prices in 1929 was 346 billion US dollars, but now it is only worth 33.3 billion US dollars. Such a sharp drop is almost like a dream (the percentage of price drops has reached 92%). The debts of individuals and exchanges are estimated at 123 trillion US dollars, including 44 trillion US dollars in corporate debt, 57 trillion in real estate secured debt, and 20 trillion US dollars in rural debt. These new debtors, in 1928 and 1929, one US dollar now has to pay 33 cents of interest. In 1929, the national income of the United States was 85 trillion, but last year the income was only 49 trillion US dollars, of which one-fifth was eaten up by interest.</p>
<p>If private debt is so huge, what about the national accounting? The total amount of US national debt is estimated at 208.6 billion US dollars, which has increased by 38.75 billion US dollars since 1929. In the past seven months of the 1933 fiscal year, revenue was insufficient, already 12.71721021 billion US dollars. At the end of January last year, the US national debt was only 178.15861117 billion US dollars, but at the end of January this year, it increased to 208.11707134 billion US dollars. In reality, the national debt increased by 30 trillion US dollars. If it were not for the assistance of the banking groups in New York, the world's major capital and the den of sin in Chicago, all national industries would go bankrupt. "Tammany" (Democratic Club), which holds the bull's ears of New York City politics, cannot but bow to the banking groups. It is not known that although the national income has shrunk, the value of the "gold dollar" has reversed and risen. Compared with 1929, the general cost of living has decreased by 22%. This means that one dollar three years ago is now worth one dollar and thirty-three cents. In other words, fewer "gold dollars" could be used to purchase more goods three years ago. People who borrowed money three years ago have to repay one gold dollar with one dollar and thirty-three cents. Therefore, those in the debtor class who used to pay six percent interest now have to pay eight percent interest. As for farmers, it is even worse, because the prices of agricultural products have plummeted. For example, if they borrowed 2,000 US dollars with a guarantee of harvesting wheat, the market price of wheat was one US dollar per bushel (about 3.6 liters in our country) four years ago, then 2,000 yuan would have to be repaid with 2,000 "bushels" of wheat. The current market value is less than 50 cents, and at least more than double must be paid to the creditor, that is, 4,000 bushels of wheat are enough to repay the debt. What a grim sight this is.</p>
<p>On the first day that President Roosevelt took office, he encountered a "financial panic." The world's "gold" king is about to fall from his throne. The first thing he wants to do is to restructure the value of the "gold dollar," and "if the value of the gold dollar does not increase, then it will be even more difficult for the American people to live." Senator Borah once said,</p>
<p>"In 1929, the total national income of the United States was 85 trillion US dollars, but last year (1932) it was only 37 trillion. If we calculate it by averaging all men, women, and children in the country, the average income per person in 1929 was 700 US dollars, but now it has been reduced to 300 US dollars. However, each person still has to bear the federal government, state government, city government, and other taxes, about 77 US dollars, and the burden of fixed interest is also assumed to be 77 US dollars. Then the national income in 1932 would only be 145 US dollars, which means that the average cost of living per person per month is only 12 US dollars..."</p>
<p>In this situation, in the country with the world's highest standard of living, the plight of the people of the United States of America, even if it is not a living hell, but the unemployed people living in small houses by the Hudson River, have no unemployment insurance and no work, only to starve with their eyes open. At the same time, the financial capitalists on Wall Street have money but nowhere to spend it. The countries of South America have announced the suspension of all debts, and a portion of US investment cannot be recovered. European countries should be better than South America, but there is probably no hope of repaying war debts. The golden dream of the Far East market has been shattered by Japan's iron fist. Now I really don't know what the future holds. The solution to the war debt problem, the abolition of tariff barriers, the reduction of armaments, the international economic conference, the opportunity to gain equality in Manchuria, the open-door policy, etc., are all major problems facing the United States, which must be resolved in order to find a way out. However, the general public seems very indifferent to these things, and in fact lacks understanding. What they want is to reduce the value of currency, open new avenues for domestic and foreign trade, restore past prosperity, raise prices, and increase the purchasing power of the general public.</p>
<p>However, credit is frozen, people's hearts are purified, and the issuance of temporary currencies in various states is prevalent. The turnover of banks is even more sluggish. The financial frenzy that swept from Michigan has spread all over the United States today. Banks have closed their doors everywhere. Yesterday was a millionaire, but overnight he became penniless. Although ordinary stores have not closed down, everyone has no money to buy things, and their business has to wait. The announcement of bank closures seems to have a very weak relationship with the middle- and lower-class families who have been poor to the extreme. The rich are trapped even more severely.</p>
<p>"Barter" is a form of society in primitive times. Unexpectedly, it is seen in the American society, which has reached the pinnacle of modern civilization, during the financial panic. According to our common sense, and after studying the general economic situation, this situation will certainly not continue for a long time, but the people of the United States will suffer even more, and I don't know when they will recover their prosperity. (New York, March 5, 1933)</p>

<h3>Communist Movement Actively Spreading</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reported on the 15th that the Kinrin Yoshida branch of the Kyoto City Sakyo Ward Reservists Association had been collecting comfort bags for troops stationed in Manchuria from the general public in the ward since the 20th of last month until the 3rd of this month, and had collected more than 2,000 bags. Unexpectedly, in each bag, a large number of anti-military documents aimed at communizing the military were suddenly discovered. The association immediately reported to the military police. As a result of the investigation, the sender was identified as Nakayama Noboru, the owner of a signboard business at No. 9 Yoshida Shimoadachi Town, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City. A few years ago, he was a leftist. This time, he took the opportunity to attempt to communize the army, falsely donating to soldiers stationed in Manchuria in the name of condolences, and secretly sealed red cloths one shaku five sun long and two shaku wide, wrapped in cultural struggles, literary news, and various reactionary news, into the comfort bags, in order to distribute them to the soldiers at the front.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Nichi-Nichi Shimbun also reported on the 15th that after a general inspection of the executives of the Writers' League, it was learned that a Pan-Pacific Anti-Imperialist Shanghai Conference was scheduled to be convened at the end of March, and demonstrations were to be held on commemorative days such as March 5th and 15th. What is most alarming is that they planned to mobilize all factories extensively and cooperate with the Anti-Imperialist League's Jōhoku Ward to connect junior high schools, military supplies factories, and grocery stores in the virgin lands of communism. Fortunately, the Ikebukuro police station discovered it in advance and arrested 17 leaders, who confessed that there were 300 to 400 accomplices, who used film, drama, and music to unite comrades and promote leftist ideas such as "Red Flag," "Anti-New," and "Anti-Imperialism News."</p>
<h3>Harbin and Hailar Under the Puppet Flag</h3>
<p>The Current Situation in Harbin Forms a Hell</p>
<p>The People of Hailar Have All Fled</p>
<h3>Harbin</h3>
<p>Harbin Communication: Since the Japanese invasion and occupation of Harbin on February 6th of last year, the people have been living in a sea of misery. The market is depressed, all industries are withering, education has been severely damaged, and a large percentage of children have dropped out of school. Bandits are everywhere, and gambling and opium are rampant. The once prosperous commercial port has been transformed into a hell. The details are as follows: (1) Japanese soldiers kill wantonly and inhumanely. Since the Japanese army invaded Harbin, any Chinese, whether farmers, workers, or businessmen, who accidentally offended Japanese residents were lightly beaten and arrested, and heavily shot and killed. Usually, when Japanese soldiers went out, they abused the people in every possible way. Even on trams, Japanese soldiers often interrogated fellow laborers sitting next to them, asking, "What country are you from?" If they answered, "Chinese," the Japanese soldiers would whip them. They would ask again, "What country are you from?" The laborers, thinking they were already subjugated, dared to call themselves Japanese, and would answer "Japanese." The Japanese soldiers would then beat them even harder and ask again. If they answered, "Korean," the Japanese soldiers would become furious, raise their guns, and pretend to shoot. Someone sitting nearby secretly told them to say "Manchukuo people," and they were spared from death. Such incidents of innocent people being killed are countless, and it is truly tragic. (2) Businesses close, people struggle to survive. After the Japanese puppets seized the Northeast Customs, they imposed heavy taxes on Chinese goods. Therefore, the goods on the market are all Japanese goods. However, the market has been devastated by the Japanese, and suffered from flood damage. In addition, the reckless issuance of banknotes has caused financial chaos, and the people are generally poor. With their purchasing power lost, businesses have been forced to close. Even those few who manage to barely survive are deserted and make no profit. Major firms, such as Gong He Li, Da Luo Xin, and Tong Fa Long, are considering closing down due to excessive losses. The Japanese puppets, fearing that their closure would cause panic in the market, have prevented them from doing so, leaving these stores in a difficult position, forced to accept losses. (3) Schools close, the number of vagrants increases. After the former Zhang Huanxiang expanded the special zone schools, the number of middle schools increased to more than ten, and there were about 300 elementary schools and more than 40 civilian schools. Recently, the Japanese have been actively destroying them, causing all middle schools to close and the school buildings to be used as barracks. Only six elementary schools remain open, using textbooks that aim to dumb down the population, with Japanese as the main subject. Civilian schools no longer exist. Harbin originally had a Sino-Russian joint venture industrial university with about a thousand Chinese students. The curriculum was rigorous, and graduates all served in society. Although it has not been affected by the war due to its relationship with Russia, the Chinese students have been deeply stimulated by being with Russian students, and they have all successively dropped out and joined the army. Other examples include the commercial university building being used as a Japanese military garrison, the second building of the law and political university being used as a puppet police station, and the Harbin Library being used as a puppet guard post, which are particularly disheartening. In total, more than 30,000 students in Harbin have dropped out of school. (4) Opium and gambling are open, prostitutes are like ants. The Japanese plan to use policies to weaken and fool the people, so opium and gambling are open and licenses are issued to collect taxes. People with weak knowledge, unaware of the enemy's scheme, rush to it. In Daowai, Harbin alone, there are more than 6,000 opium dens. The large number of addicts is self-evident. Furthermore, there are Japanese who sell morphine and heroin everywhere. Gambling games such as Pai Gow, lottery, Sic Bo, and Mahjong are all available. Gambling dens are called clubs. The number of people who have been bankrupted is unknown. As a result, prostitutes are like ants and bandits are rampant. Street kidnappings and indoor scams are common. (5) Soldiers are treated like prisoners, police are treated like enemies. Except for high-ranking officers, the puppet troops all want to revolt. The Japanese know this well and are very strict in their prevention. In addition to sending Japanese trainers and officers to the teams, they dare not issue ammunition in large quantities. Each soldier is only issued 200 bullets during combat, and only a few dozen at other times. At night, firearms are locked in the armory to prevent mutiny. Soldiers in the Miller camp even have to hand in their shoes and socks at night, which are locked in a room. They have to walk barefoot to go to the toilet. They are treated like prisoners. The police are even more mistreated. In the recent reorganization of the police department, Japanese occupy four out of the seven major section chief positions. (6) The people are eager to recover lost territory. Since our country blocked postal and telegraphic communications, the Northeast has been cut off from the interior. Harbin newspapers are used by the Japanese to spread propaganda that is unfavorable to our country. Except for those who are willing to act as accomplices for the</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>Japanese, the general public is eager for our government to recover lost territory as soon as possible. If our government is determined to confront Japan and unite, then the people of the Northeast will certainly rise up and respond.</p>
<h3>Hailar</h3>
<p>The Miller Review reported a communication from a foreigner in Harbin saying, "I traveled from Hailar to Harbin. The train was extremely crowded and there were not enough vehicles to meet the demand because when the Soviet Union saw the arrival of the Japanese army, they moved the best locomotives and trains across the border. The police first entered the train to check travel permits, and then a Japanese officer who came with them asked each passenger for a business card. For those he suspected, he personally checked them one by one. This Japanese officer glanced at the Chinese passengers sitting in the same carriage as me, raised his thumb, and made a sound to signal them to stand up. The Chinese passengers all changed color, angry but afraid to speak. If these Chinese had ever had any good feelings towards 'Manchukuo,' judging by what they told me after this Japanese officer left, they clearly expressed that they had already sided with the other side. No forts were seen along the way, but the buildings occupied by the Japanese were almost all surrounded by railway networks. Drunken Japanese soldiers constantly roamed Hailar, acting as if they were conquerors. While I was waiting for the train, a Harbin train arrived carrying twenty Japanese prostitutes. Someone told me that whenever the Japanese army entered a city or town, a batch of prostitutes would follow. Hailar is already like a dead cave. After four o'clock in the afternoon, there are no pedestrians on the street. Prices have fallen for everything, especially meat, butter, fish, and firewood, but there are no buyers. The Chinese residents have all fled, united in their hatred of the Japanese. The term 'Manchukuo' is regarded as a curse. On the train, I wanted a rag to wipe the seat, and a soldier calling himself 'Manchukuo' gave me a 'Manchukuo' flag instead, as if to know what he was thinking. The Japanese army occupied Hailar without firing a shot. On December 3rd and 4th, General Su Bingwen's troops left Hailar on three trains, and the next day three trains of Japanese troops entered the city. The Mongols in the Hailar area generally sympathize with the Japanese because they are dissatisfied with the treatment of the Chinese. The Japanese are spreading rumors that the Chinese will colonize all of Mongolia, convert it into farming areas, and end the nomadic life of the Mongols."</p>
<p>Japanese Army</p>
<h3>Failed to Attack Dongjiakou</h3>
<p>Appropriately transporting the remains of fallen officers and soldiers back to Shenyang</p>
<p>And building defensive works to quietly await reinforcements</p>
<p>Beiping Communication: On the Xifengkou front, on the morning of the 21st, the enemy army launched a fierce attack, and fierce battles broke out along the entire line. Our army calmly responded. That evening, the enemy stopped attacking and retreated to the Baitaizi position. Today (22nd), there were only local conflicts on the front lines. For example, in the Dongjiakou area, a combined force of enemy infantry, artillery, and cavalry, numbering about a thousand, attacked at 8:00 AM this morning, but also failed. More than 20 Japanese aircraft also flew to Zunhua Santunying for bombing. Outside Luowenyu, the Japanese army has retreated to the Banbishan and Foyeshan areas, constructing defensive works nearby. The enemy's reinforcements have moved towards Huangyaguan. A certain division of our army stationed in Malanguan is closely guarding against them. Song Zheyuan, the commander-in-chief of the Twenty-ninth Army, accompanied by Kong Xiangxi, Pang Bingxun, Xiao Zhenying, Yu Feipeng, etc., arrived at a certain place near Zunhua at 10:00 PM tonight and will go to the Luowenyu front tomorrow morning for inspection. A certain important person who came from the front line to Peiping this morning said that the results of the fierce fighting near Shanchayu outside Luowenyu in the previous days showed that the enemy suffered heavy casualties and corpses were scattered everywhere. Division Commander Liu Ruming has already taken photos of the uniforms and insignia of two enemy colonels found on the battlefield and will send them to Peiping within days. Near Diaoyutai, the enemy has had wounded soldiers for more than eight days. The remains of the fallen officers and soldiers were mostly burned by the Japanese army. The remains of an important military officer have been sent back to Pingquan and transported back to Shenyang by plane.</p>
<p>Liu Shifu, the director of the Beiping office of Song Zheyuan's troops, said today that Zhou, a member of our army's staff, returned to Peiping from the front this morning. According to him, in the Luowenyu area, the enemy troops have been repelled by our Liu Ruming's division to about 20 miles outside the pass. The enemy troops are grabbing civilians there to build fortifications and prepare for defense. Judging by their intentions, they seem to be quietly awaiting reinforcements. Starting today, our soldiers on the front lines are clearing the battlefield. According to local residents, the enemy army suffered heavy casualties after being attacked by us. In addition to transporting some of the wounded by car, on the 20th, the enemy sent several planes to the area to transport away five or six bodies of officers above the rank of captain. There are still five or six hundred bodies on the battlefield. In this battle, from the 9th to the 11th, the enemy army attacked us with planes, tanks, heavy artillery, and a large number of troops. Our army took a defensive posture, seemingly completely passive. Since the 12th, after our army destroyed the enemy's artillery positions, the enemy was unable to resist. Our army then launched surprise attacks on the fields every night. The enemy was unable to defend against our army, and thus our army changed from being passive to being active. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Returns to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Tan Sui talks about Chen's assassination attempt</p>
<p>The assassin was captured and executed on the spot</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: After Chen Jitang encountered danger in Jieyang during his inspection of the East River, he turned to Chaozhou and Meizhou, passing through Xingning, Laolong, and Heyuan. On the 16th night, he arrived in Huizhou. He left Huizhou at 12:00 PM and went to Zhangmutou Station on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, taking a pre-arranged special train to Guangzhou overnight. He arrived in Guangzhou at 5:50 AM on the 17th and went back to the model village residence in Dongshan for rest. Military and political circles went to express their condolences. Chen briefly spoke for a moment, and the visitors were dismissed. Chen, feeling tired from the journey, was unable to speak at length, so he sent Tan Sui, the chief of staff of the Second Army, who accompanied him on the inspection, to receive the guests. According to Tan, Chen first took the Haizhou warship to Shanwei during his inspection of the East River. He landed in Shanwei and passed through Haifeng, Lufeng, Kuitan, and Puning. On the morning of the 7th, he arrived in Jieyang from Puning, where he encountered danger. When Chen landed in Jieyang, a person resembling a messenger handed him a document in the welcoming crowd at the pier. Chen received and opened the document. Suddenly, the messenger revealed malicious intent. His left hand tightly held Chen's belt, and his right hand reached into his pocket to grab a hand grenade, intending to throw it at Chen. Chen noticed this and immediately hugged the assailant tightly to prevent the grenade from being thrown. The entourage saw this dangerous situation, and Zhang Ruigui, the commander of the Independent Second Division, stepped forward and knocked the assailant's left hand away. The entourage protected Chen from danger, pushing the assailant away. The assailant stumbled to the ground, and the hand grenade exploded at the same time, wounding 15 guards and killing two. The assailant was also injured and arrested on the spot. According to his confession, he was a communist. He was then taken out and executed by the defense army. After Chen escaped danger, he left Jieyang that day and went to Shantou, staying for three days. On the morning of the 9th, he passed through Chaoan to Meixian. After inspecting Jiaoling from Meixian, he then added Meixian city. From Meixian, he passed through Xingning and Wuhua, arriving at Laolong on the 14th and Heyuan on the 15th. On the night of the 16th, he arrived in Huizhou late at night. He left Huizhou from Zhangmutou Station, taking a special train to Guangzhou. During this trip through the eastern districts, he inspected the Fifth Division, the Third Army, the Second Independent Division, and the First Independent Division, and gave speeches to the troops. Chen gave speeches everywhere he went, generally explaining the Guangdong provincial government's determination to implement a three-year administration plan, abolish all exorbitant taxes, relieve the people's suffering, and hoped that the people would realize local autonomy and unite against foreign enemies.</p>
<p>Liu Ruiheng Talks About</p>
<h3>Frontline Rescue Situation</h3>
<p>There is a Considerable Organization</p>
<p>Rescue is Not a Problem</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: Liu Ruiheng, the director of the Central Health Administration and chairman of the North China Rescue Association, returned to Beijing from Peiping. This morning, the reporter interviewed Mr. Liu on the train and asked about the war situation and rescue efforts on the front lines. According to him, in recent days, there have been no fierce battles in Xifengkou and Gubeikou except for Luowenyu. The Rescue Association has taken in and rescued more than 2,000 wounded soldiers from Song Zheyuan's troops, more than 3,000 from the Central government's directly subordinate divisions, and more than 1,000 each from Wang Yizhe's and Sun Dianying's troops, totaling 7,000 to 8,000. More than 3,000 are in Beiping, more than 2,000 are in Tongzhou, more than 1,000 are in Kangzhuang, and the rest are in various places. The Japanese propaganda that we have many wounded soldiers is unreliable. Two-thirds of the wounded are lightly wounded, mostly from aircraft bombs. When the North China Rescue Association was first established, it was quite difficult due to the hasty organization and insufficient personnel. The hospitals of various armies were also not fully equipped. Now there are 12 rescue teams, each with a dozen or so doctors and nurses, plus several dozen stretcher bearers, distributed in Beiping, Miyun, Zunhua, Jizhou, Tongzhou, Kangzhuang, Sanhe, and other places for rescue. Wounded soldiers from Gubeikou are first transported to Miyun, and wounded soldiers from Xifengkou are first transported to Zunhua, and then transported to Tongzhou and Beiping. Wounded soldiers from Sun Dianying's troops are transported from Zhangjiakou to Kangzhuang. The Central Rear Military Hospital has also been established in Baoding, Shunde, and other places, on a very large scale. Various charitable organizations in Peiping and Tianjin have also organized themselves voluntarily, so there are enough hospital doctors, and they are working very hard. The funding is all self-raised or donated by various parties, so as long as the front-line troops can fight, rescue is not a problem. I have returned to Beijing to handle everything because the northern rescue matters are already being enthusiastically handled by Xiong Bing and other committee members, and the affairs of the Central Hospital and the Health Administration are also very busy. The overall national health renovation plan has not been actively implemented due to the situation and funding issues. (24th)</p>
<h3>Qingdao Organizes Local Association</h3>
<p>Donate One Year of Land Rent and Land Tax</p>
<p>Civil Servants Donate Half a Month's Salary</p>
<p>Qingdao Communication: Since the loss of Rehe, North China has been shocked. The cities of Peiping and Tianjin have organized local associations, raising donations in various ways to share the national crisis. All sectors in Qingdao have risen up in response and are now organizing a local association to conduct large-scale national salvation fundraising in order to defend themselves and defend the country. It is planned to first donate one year of land rent and land tax. Other fundraising methods are being discussed. Shen Honglie, the commander of the navy and mayor of Qingdao, also believes that civil servants are members of the nation and should not be left behind in defending the country. It is the time to destroy the family to relieve the country. The city government and the navy headquarters have jointly determined the donation methods as follows: (1) This donation is named the National Salvation Special Donation. (2) All staff members of the city government and the navy headquarters will donate half a month's salary once, according to their current actual salary, in three monthly installments, starting from this month. (3) Naval soldiers and city police, as well as workers in the city government and navy headquarters, will donate according to four grades: 3 yuan for Yuan grade, 2 yuan for Xiang grade, 1 yuan for Li grade, and 5 jiao for Zhen grade, with personal freedom to donate, limited to one time. (4) After the implementation of the above measures, all previous monthly donations of 1% for disaster relief will be stopped immediately. The allocated donations should be deducted after this donation is deducted. In addition to the navy, which is ordered by the navy headquarters, the city government has instructed all subordinate bureaus and stations to comply. (24th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Provincial Order to Arrest Bandit Collaborators</p>
<p>The county government received a secret telegram from the Director of Civil Affairs of Jiangsu Province, approving the inquiry from the Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang Province regarding Zhou Qingfan, also known as Zhou Qinghuai, suspected of selling guns to kidnapper Fan Bingfa. County Magistrate Shen immediately sent a secret telegram to Zhang Jilin, the director of the Fengjing Second Branch Bureau, to arrest and interrogate him. Zhou Qingfan used to be the chief of the Fengjing Security Corps. Since Fan Bingfa's kidnapping case was discovered, Jiashan County of Zhejiang Province has summoned him many times without success, and the Civil Affairs Department has reported him for arrest. Director Zhang of the branch bureau will find a way to summon Zhou Qingfan, escort him to the county government today (25th), and detain him temporarily, waiting to be reported to the Civil Affairs Department for handling.</p>
<h3>Joint Patrol of Water and Land Police on a Regular Basis</h3>
<p>The Nine-County Joint Defense Office recently ordered the water and land police teams of various counties to hold joint patrols. This county ordered the water patrol team and police team to set off on a regular basis and hold joint patrols in Jinshanwei. Fan Zhicheng, the captain of the first team of the first district of the provincial public security team, also held joint patrols with the Qingpu water police team in Fanbang New Town and other places to arrest bandits and maintain local peace.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Rice Business Tax Issue Resolved</p>
<p>The Wuxi rice industry, in the urban and rural areas, is divided into eight sections, with more than 130 lines. Due to the decline of the rice market and sluggish business, the lines have been closing down one after another. The nature of the business is mostly reselling among the same industry, which is completely different from the situation in other counties. Even the same industry in the eight sections is different. Therefore, they still failed to declare the business tax for the previous year in accordance with the regulations. The bureau, however, is limited by the regulations, and the provincial order urges the declaration urgently. It has repeatedly sent personnel to investigate, resulting in a conflict between the investigator and Pan Lugang, the owner of Jianyi Rice Bank outside the South Gate, constituting two crimes of obstructing official duties and injury. The lawsuit is still unresolved. Recently, the county chamber of commerce discussed with the county government to negotiate with both parties repeatedly, and the intentions gradually approached. Yesterday (25th) morning, the chamber of commerce invited more than 30 section directors from the eight rice industry sections to discuss the matter at the meeting. County Magistrate Chen and Xia, the director of the Business Tax Bureau, attended the meeting. As a result, it was decided that the industry association would report first with the lines. The total amount of all taxes, starting from the autumn of the 21st year, will be 10,000 yuan for the whole year. Regarding the re-examination of the accounts, the industry association will send personnel to assist the Business Tax Bureau in the joint investigation. At this point, the rice industry business tax, which has been deadlocked for half a year, can be resolved.</p>
<h3>Fifth District Township Head Robbed Three Times</h3>
<p>Lu Huiyun, the township head of Liujiadang Township in the Fifth District of the county, has a well-to-do family and has long been coveted by bandits. On the night of the first of this month, six or seven bandits robbed him with weapons, causing hundreds of yuan in losses. The victim, Lu Huiyun, was also tied up and beaten by the bandits. The case has been reported to the 13th branch bureau of public security and the security corps for investigation and arrest. Unexpectedly, ten days later, on the night of the 14th, more bandits came to Lu's house to rob. The door had been broken. Lu's whole family was asleep. Fortunately, the villagers heard the alarm and rang the gongs to call for help. The bandits fled in panic. Afterwards, the Fifth District Security Corps believed that Lu's house had been robbed twice, which was detrimental to local security, so it sent 10 corps members armed with weapons to patrol the Sitou area of Liujiadang all night. However, on the night of the day before yesterday (24th) at 9:00 PM, more than a dozen armed bandits came to Lu's house for the third time to rob. Lu's family members climbed onto the roof and shouted wildly. The villagers rushed to the scene, and the bandits were frightened away. The security corps and police officers also rushed to the scene after hearing the news, and arrested one bandit on the spot. He has been escorted to the bureau and transferred to the city for interrogation and detention. The remaining bandits are being pursued.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Lian Huaipu Died in Battle Against Japan</p>
<p>Lian Huaipu, a native of the county, joined the army in the 16th year of the Republic of China and was under the command of Xu Tingyao, the former commander of the Fourth Division. He accumulated military merits and was transferred to the 25th Division under Guan Linzheng, serving as the commander of the 3rd machine gun company. This time, he was ordered to set off to the front line to fight against the enemy, and he died heroically in the battle of Gubeikou. The 3rd Machine Gun Company of the 149th Regiment of the division has informed his family by letter and has buried the martyr's remains in Miyun County, Hebei Province. All sectors in the county were shocked and mourned after hearing the bad news. In addition to launching a memorial service by the county, district, party, and government agencies on the same day, they also sent a telegram to the front to inquire about the circumstances of the Lian martyr's death on that day in order to commend him.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Water Police Extort Cattle Dealers</p>
<p>A certain Xie, the captain of the water police detachment stationed in Fushan, seized 22 heads of plowing cattle in Dengshi the other day. Xie confiscated them because private sales of plowing cattle violated the ban. It turned out that the cattle were actually yellow cattle, not plowing cattle. Therefore, the two town chiefs, Lang and Zhang, were asked to intercede. After paying 100 yuan, they were released. On the afternoon of the 23rd, 18 yellow cattle were transported through Lihua. The water police stationed there immediately stopped them and did not allow them to pass, and brought the cattle to the guardhouse. The cattle dealers then bribed them with 60 yuan, but they refused. That night, two policemen were guarding the cattle. Unexpectedly, the cattle dealers secretly took them away one by one. When the police learned the news, they went to chase them. Suddenly, dozens of people rushed out in the coastal area and surrounded and beat the police officer Zhou Xuekun, who was seriously injured and stabbed in the leg. Then they dispersed.</p>

These days, they are rushing to ship goods and also work at night. At midnight on the 24th, shop assistant Tang Hongwu was making firecrackers. Due to hammering nails on gunpowder, a loud explosion occurred, shaking down the second row of houses and injuring Zhang Xisheng, Xia Yueqing, Liu Manlang, Liu Shulan, Xue Shengyu, Bian Asi, and shop owner Xu Hongtang, seven people in total. Most of their clothes were burned and their faces and arms were burned. All were sent to Lunyuan Hospital for treatment. Among them, three people were seriously injured, but their lives were not in danger.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Seizure of Smuggled Opium</p>
<p>Yue Tianbao, a resident of Raozhuang Bridge in the South Township, came from Shanghai on a regular ship yesterday, carrying a large amount of smuggled opium. A plainclothes detective from the county government found out and seized two large wooden boxes full of 54 bags of opium, weighing more than 740 taels, on the ship. The witnesses were also escorted to the county. Shen Cheng, the judge, opened the court for interrogation. His confession was ambiguous. He was ordered to be sent to prison to await trial.</p>

The debate ended the day before yesterday, and the sentence was scheduled to be pronounced yesterday. The main text of the judgment stated that Wang Jiwu was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fined 3,000 yuan for the embezzlement and dereliction of duty case. It is said that Wang has decided to appeal.</p>
<h3>Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Storm Resolved</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Bureau could not make ends meet due to excessive quotas and negotiated with merchants to increase them. The Tobacco Merchants Association expressed its opposition. Because of the weak market and dull life, it was difficult to increase. Both sides expressed their difficulties. Hu Xiwu, the chairman of the industry association, proposed a method to consider both sides and asked the chamber of commerce to assist in mediation. After two months of negotiations, it has been properly resolved. All unanimously paid taxes and obtained licenses in accordance with procedures.</p>

<p>Robbery Case in Dongsheng Village</p>
<p>Sheng Shanren, a resident of Dongsheng Village in Luotuo Bridge, Cixi East, is employed at an arts and crafts company in Shanghai. His wife and three maids were left at home. Unexpectedly, at around 4 a.m. yesterday (the 23rd), seven robbers suddenly arrived, armed with weapons, and broke into the house. They tied up Sheng's wife and maids with ropes, confined them to a room, and looted for an hour before leaving with a whoop. After inspection, it was found that clothes, jewelry, silver dollars, and other items were looted, resulting in a loss of over 3,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei and Sun Ke Returned to Nanjing Together Last Night</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang said he was going to meet with Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission.</p>
<p>The Premier of the Executive Yuan May Be Announced Tomorrow</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingwei has repeatedly expressed his humility regarding the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan. After a resolution by the Central Standing Committee, Mr. Sun Ke and Mr. Gu Mengyu were dispatched to Shanghai, one after the other, to persuade him to stay. Mr. Sun Ke arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and immediately went to meet with Mr. Wang. The outcome of their conversation was quite satisfactory, and Mr. Wang's intention to resign may have been dispelled. At 11:30 p.m. last night, Mr. Sun Ke and Mr. Wang returned to Nanjing together. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The two representatives dispatched by the Central Government to persuade Mr. Wang Jingwei to stay, Mr. Sun Ke and Mr. Gu Mengyu, apart from Mr. Gu, who had already arrived in Shanghai the night before to visit Mr. Wang and persuade him to stay, Mr. Sun also left Beijing by night train the night before, arriving in Shanghai at around 8 a.m. yesterday. After getting off the train, Mr. Sun first returned to his Shanghai residence at 22 Columbia Road for a brief rest.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng Visited Mr. Wang</h3>
<p>At 9 a.m., he went to Mr. Wang's residence on Route Ghisi to meet and talk with Mr. Wang, and conveyed the intentions of the Central Government, requesting that Mr. Wang immediately go to Nanjing to resume his duties. Mr. Wang initially declined humbly, but after Mr. Sun's sincere persuasion, and because Ms. Soong was unwilling to continue in the role, Mr. Wang finally agreed to go to Nanjing that day to discuss the selection of a successor. After talking in detail for an hour, Mr. Sun left at 10:10 a.m. At 10:20 a.m., Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng continued to visit, inquiring about Mr. Wang's opinions on resuming his duties and offering his persuasion, before leaving at 10:40 a.m.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang's Remarks</h3>
<p>After Mr. Sun's visit, Mr. Wang personally saw him off and then made remarks to the reporters of the New Sound News Agency, saying that he had resigned from his position at the Central Government and proposed that Ms. Soong succeed him. After arriving in Shanghai, he immediately visited Ms. Soong, asking her to formally take over the position. However, because Ms. Soong's responsibilities in handling finances were also extremely heavy, she could not concurrently hold the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan. Therefore, the Central Government ordered him to take on the role. This morning, after the results of his meeting with Mr. Sun, it was decided that the issue of the Premier of the Executive Yuan would be discussed after arriving in Nanjing, and another suitable successor would be decided upon. If there is still no suitable candidate, then whether or not he will resume his duties will be further discussed. As for the time and place of his meeting with Chairman Jiang, because it concerns military matters, it is difficult to announce for the time being. His tone suggested that his intention to resign had been dispelled. In addition, Mr. Wang also stated that rumors that he resigned due to differences of opinion were completely untrue, and that the work of the Executive Yuan had not been suspended due to his resignation.</p>
<h3>Mr. Sun's Remarks</h3>
<p>The President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Ke, received reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Columbia Road at 11 p.m. last night and made remarks, saying that Chairman Jiang plans to make a trip south within one or two days. Mr. Wang, after our delegation conveyed the Central Government's wishes and earnestly persuaded him to stay, agreed to go to Nanjing this evening (i.e., last night). The issue of resuming his position as Premier of the Executive Yuan will be discussed again after arriving in Nanjing. According to my conjecture, it is hoped that his intention to resign will be dispelled. Because the duties of the Premier of the Executive Yuan are heavy, apart from Mr. Wang and Ms. Soong, there is really no suitable candidate for the time being. It is also the intention of the various committees of the Central Government that Mr. Wang is the only one who can do it. Mr. Wang decided to go to Nanjing tonight (i.e., last night), and I plan to travel with him.</p>
<h3>Returned to Nanjing Last Night</h3>
<p>At 11:30 p.m. last night, the President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Ke, accompanied by Wang Jingwei and his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, the Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, Tang Youren, and others, took two special carriages attached to the Beijing-Shanghai night train to Nanjing. The security at the station was extremely tight. According to what Mr. Wang told reporters on the train, Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission may come south from the front line today (i.e., yesterday) for a meeting. As for the Premier of the Executive Yuan, it is hoped that Ms. Soong will take on the difficult task. When reporters asked if Ms. Soong firmly declined, whether Mr. Wang would agree to resume his duties, Mr. Wang said, "We'll talk about it when we get to Nanjing. It should be decided tomorrow (the 26th), and the successor to the new Premier will definitely be announced the day after tomorrow (the 27th." Furthermore, according to Mr. Sun, the Central Government hopes that Mr. Wang will return to his position, and it is likely to be realized.</p>

<h3>Telegraphed to Condemn Japan's Atrocities</h3>
<p>Telegraph to the Delegation to Forward to the League of Nations</p>
<p>A telegram from the front lines on March 22 read: "Forwarded to the Chinese Delegation in Geneva, forwarded to the League of Nations for your appraisal. Japan has forcibly occupied our Northeast provinces, created a puppet government, and disregarded the resolutions of your organization. Recently, it has also invaded Jehol, proving that it relies on military force, disregards justice, intends to destroy the League of Nations Charter, and intends to disrupt world peace. This association vows to lead the people of Zhaoling in a death-defying resistance war. We hope that you will uphold justice, fulfill your treaty obligations, and swiftly implement effective sanctions. Respectfully, Zhaoling Joint Village Self-Government Association, Jehol."</p>

<p>A telegram from Beiping read: "(Respectful Appraisal) Repeatedly received telegrams from Commander Shang, Yang Yushen, and others stating that the enemy in the Lengkou area has, since yesterday, used over a hundred armored vehicles to cover over a thousand infantrymen, attached with cavalry guns and other soldiers, in the vicinity of Tushimen, and engaged in fierce fighting with the advance troops of our ☐☐☐ regiment.

Also, a telegram from Chen said that, according to a telegram from Division Commander Huang Ma Hai, it was reported that at 2 p.m. this afternoon, 30 enemy armored vehicles advanced from Dazhangzi towards Tushishan, and all roads were blocked and destroyed with explosives. Our plainclothes squad leader Ma Caiying led a plainclothes squad to bravely counterattack, covering the blocking of the roads at Tushimen, and doing their best to prevent the enemy from advancing. The fierce fighting was intense, and the enemy suffered considerable casualties. Subsequently, a large number of enemies arrived with machine guns and artillery to launch a major bombardment. Squad Leader Ma and one soldier were killed in action. The plainclothes squad has now retreated to defend ☐☐☐, etc. According to this situation, the enemy's vanguard can contact our advance troops by tomorrow morning. In addition to ordering a strict defense and doing our best to kill the enemy, we respectfully report this by telegram. Another telegram from Yangchen stated that, according to a telegram from Division Commander Huang Guanghua Yanghai, this evening, the enemy facing ☐☐☐ Lin regiment consists of over a thousand infantry and cavalry, attached with four mountain guns, several tanks, and over a hundred armored vehicles, and engaged in fierce fighting with our Lin regiment all day. The Madaogou position was lost and regained more than ten times, and is still in our hands. In this battle, we destroyed three enemy tanks, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. We also suffered casualties of five officers, and the number of soldiers is being investigated. It is now planned to order Dai battalion to bypass the enemy's left flank from ☐☐☐ and Li battalion to bypass their right rear, in order to encircle and annihilate them. In addition to separately copying and distributing this to various newspapers and replying with condolences, we respectfully report this by telegram. Colleagues respectfully report, Jingxu Second General Qiao Yin."</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan and Wang Zhengting</p>
<h3>Arrived in Shanghai from Beiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhu Talked About the Righteous Army Hoping for Full Support</p>
<p>Wang Talked About the Efforts of the North China Anti-Japanese Army</p>
<p>General Zhu Qinglan, accompanied by former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, arrived in Tianjin from Beiping yesterday morning, and then took the Beijing-Shanghai train at 10 a.m., arriving in Shanghai at 6 p.m. yesterday. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency met with Mr. Zhu and Mr. Wang at the station yesterday and had a conversation with them as follows:</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan said that the Northeast Righteous Army is scattered in four provinces, either attacking enemy troops or waiting for an opportunity to act, but still hopes that all sectors of society and the Central Government will provide full support, and hopes that the Central Government will have a comprehensive plan for the anti-Japanese military affairs. If the Righteous Army has sufficient supplies and equipment, and can take unified action with the Central Army, it will have a greater effect.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting said that after inspecting North China, the Anti-Japanese Army is quite capable, and the Pingjin area is peaceful. Rumors are not credible. He met with Chairman Jiang in Baoding, which was an ordinary meeting and had no special mission.</p>
<p>Xiao Zhenying Telegraphed</p>
<h3>The Frontline Urgently Needs Supplies</h3>
<p>Anti-Aircraft Weapons, Heavy-Duty Vehicles</p>
<p>Radio Stations, Searchlights, etc.</p>
<p>Sun Longji, the director of the Communications Office of the 29th Army of the Land Forces, the 3rd Army Corps of North China, stationed in Shanghai, yesterday sent separate letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, local associations, the Bankers' Association, the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, the Northeast Refugee Relief Association, the Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang-Jehol Volunteer Army Support Association, the Shanghai Northeast Refugee Relief Association, and other organizations, transcribing two telegrams from Chief of Staff Xiao Zhenying, which are recorded separately below: (1) "Japanese bandits have penetrated deeply. Our Commander-in-Chief Mingxuan, with a force of 40,000, guards more than 200 li of the Great Wall, fighting fiercely for eleven days and nights, annihilating more than 10,000 enemy troops, capturing 18 large cannons, more than ten tanks and armored vehicles, and more than 4,000 rifles, and burning countless supplies. One of our brigade commanders was wounded, three regimental commanders were wounded, four battalion commanders were killed in action, and more than 6,000 soldiers were killed or wounded. The intensity of the battle and the morale of the troops are unprecedented. Recently, the enemies attacking the Luowenyu area were cleverly cut into the enemy's陣陣 at night, and after bloody battles, the enemy was溃退ed forty li away, to the Banbishan area. We also found diaries in the enemy's陣陣, which recorded that two Japanese佐 and eight尉 or more were killed in action this time. However, the enemy is unwilling to accept repeated setbacks, and has redeployed a large force to plan another all-out attack. Our soldiers regard death as home and will definitely fight to the end. The only problem is the lack of空防 and a shortage of利器, relying solely on肉薄, which is not a sustainable solution. In recent days, people at home and abroad have either voiced their support or come to express their condolences, which has touched our hearts and boosted morale. Because I am in a remote area and negotiations are difficult, if your association is willing to provide any assistance, please consult with Director Sun Longji of our army's Shanghai office for urgent needs. Xiao Zhenying bowed. (2) Sun Longji, I appreciate your勋鉴. Having received and understood your養电, our troops' battle line now stretches across more than 200 li, and transportation is difficult. Often, after fighting all day and night, they still have to march more than 100 li. The most urgently needed items are a large number of heavy-duty vehicles, as well as wireless stations and searchlights. Please forward this message. Zhang Weifan and Xiao Zhenying bowed."</p>
<p>Family Members of Wang Delin and Others</p>
<h3>Will Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Temporarily Residing at the Shanghai Grand Hotel</p>
<p>A dispatch from the Shishi News Agency in this city stated that a group of over a hundred family members of the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin Volunteer Army arrived in Shanghai on the Wuyang Lun of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company from Qingdao the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the army's representative, Liang Yuanshan, had notified the Renji Hall and other organizations that the ship would arrive in Shanghai at 6 or 7 a.m. this morning and dock at the Jinliyuan Wharf in the French Concession. However, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with Zhao Yuntai, the chief of the shipping department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, yesterday, who said that the Wuyang Lun departed from Qingdao at 7 p.m. on the 24th and is expected to arrive in port at approximately 5 p.m. on the 26th, docking at the Jinliyuan Wharf. The preparations for the accommodation of all parties are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Number of People Arriving</h3>
<p>When they departed from Vladivostok, there were originally 188 people, including 19 wounded soldiers and 11 family members of Brigade Commander Zheng, who had already landed in Tianjin and gone to Beiping for residence and medical treatment. The actual number of people arriving in Shanghai is 158. In addition to Commander Wang's wife and children, Brigade Commanders Liu and Kong also came with them. When Liu and others arrive in Shanghai, due to their unfamiliarity with the place, in order to avoid unscrupulous people taking advantage of the situation, the army headquarters specially issued certificate documents for proof to avoid trouble.</p>
<h3>Accommodation Location</h3>
<p>The family members of Commander Wang and others were initially planned to be accommodated at the Shanghai Injured Soldiers' Hospital in West Shanghai. However, due to the complete lack of beds and other daily necessities, Mr. Qu Wenliu introduced them to the Shanghai Grand Hotel in Baoyu Lane for accommodation. Yesterday, a reporter from the Shishi News Agency specially visited Mr. Huang, the manager of the hotel, who said that the entire second and third floors had been reserved. Among them, it had been decided that Commander Wang's wife and children would live in Room 31 on the third floor, Brigade Commander Kong would live in Room 31, and Brigade Commander Liu and his wife would live in Room 23 on the second floor. The rest had not yet been decided. The cost of food and accommodation is 77 cents per person per day, half price for children under the age of 14. The total daily expenses are estimated to be around 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Sun Ke Promised the People</p>
<h3>The Central Government Is Determined to Fight the Enemy</h3>
<p>Only a Matter of Strength</p>
<p>No Room for Compromise</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that recently, the Japanese side has repeatedly spread rumors of a compromise between China and Japan, a ceasefire on the front lines, and the imminent start of direct negotiations, in order to confuse the people of the world and incite the emotions of our people. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Mr. Sun Zhesheng, the President of the Legislative Yuan, yesterday to inquire about the truth of this matter. According to President Sun, if Japan can abolish the puppet state, withdraw its troops from the three northeastern provinces and Jehol, and return the Northeast to our country, then China and Japan may have the possibility of negotiations. However, can Japan abolish the puppet state? Can it withdraw its troops and return the Northeast to our country? Everyone knows that this is impossible. If Japan can abolish the puppet state and free the slaves, then that's it. Otherwise, there is no room for direct negotiations between China and Japan. The Central Government's policy towards Japan has not changed, and it can only fight the enemy. I dare to promise the people that the Central Government is determined to fight the enemy, relying only on strength. At present, it is only a matter of strength, and there is no room for compromise.</p>
<h3>Second Collection Results for Saving the Nation Through Aviation</h3>
<p>Total Reached Over 290,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Fresh Meat Industry Plans to Raise 100,000 Yuan Independently</p>
<p>At 4 p.m. yesterday, the Shanghai City Collection Team of the Chinese Aviation Association held its second results report at the YMCA. The total team leader Wu Tiecheng and the various team leaders Cai Zengji, Lai Zhenhuan, Yang Nianzu, Li Tingan, Wang Yinting, Qian Jinhua, Tong Hangbai, Li Denghui, Li Mengnan, Pan Gongzhan, Zheng Tonghe, Zhou Feicheng, Zhu Shaoping, Wang Lianfang, Huang Zaoxiong, Lin Kanghou, and others, totaling over a hundred people, attended. First, the total team leader reported the general amount of the second results. Then, Xu Shiying, Li Tingan, Lin Kanghou, and others gave speeches in succession. Finally, Zhu Shaoping, the director of the solicitation section, announced the scores of each team. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Report by the Total Team Leader</h3>
<p>The total team leader Wu Tiecheng reported, roughly stating that today is the day for the Shanghai City Collection Team of the Chinese Aviation Association to report its second results. In terms of organizations, the achievements this time include: (1) the Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Association proposed that the association raise 100,000 yuan to purchase an aircraft to be named the "Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry" aircraft; (2) the Guangdong native place association in Shanghai initiated a collection of 100,000 yuan to purchase a fighter plane, which is now underway; (3) the "Shanghai Boy Scout" aircraft planned to be purchased by the ten Shanghai city boy scouts will begin a general mobilization on the 27th. In terms of individuals, the most commendable achievements include: (1) Gu Jiatang 12,000 yuan; (2) Lu Fengzhu 10,450 yuan; (3) Du Yuesheng, Yan Yukun, Lu Zhengbing, Yang Hu, Yang Weiyin, etc., 10,000 yuan each. The total amount has reached over 290,000 yuan. Now we calculate that there is only one month and five days left until the end date. The total amount received in these two collections is still very different from our estimated goal of 2 million yuan. However, the total population of Shanghai is 3 million, and Shanghai is the economic center of the country. All other businesses are in a leading position. This time we are holding the aviation saving the nation movement in Shanghai because we believe that aviation is the most needed weapon in national defense. I think if we unite the enthusiasm of the people of the whole city and the efforts of the team leaders and members of each team, this number of 1 million yuan can definitely be achieved and become an advocate for the whole country. People in Shanghai have a saying, "Merchants don't惜錢, soldiers don't惜命," and another saying, "You only make money when there's a fight." But if you only value money, it's not very useful, because money can't be directly used as a weapon. We must exchange the money for weapons, supply them to the soldiers, and only then can the soldiers take these weapons to kill the enemy, defend the country, and protect the nation.</p>
<h3>Lin Kanghou's Speech</h3>
<p>Next, Lin Kanghou, in his capacity as the secretary of the Aviation Association, gave a speech to the public, roughly stating that the aviation saving the nation movement we are holding this time is not hoping that the people will donate money and immediately purchase aircraft to go to the front line to kill the enemy. Our intention is to recognize the importance of the position of the aviation industry today, and the aviation industry in our country is still so infantile. Therefore, the people should take the initiative to launch and build aviation. The association now plans to use the donated funds to establish an aeronautical school in Shanghai, and plans to establish a factory to repair various parts inside aircraft. The association deeply believes that this movement did not occur on a momentary impulse, but focuses on the spirit of aviation construction.</p>
<h3>Efforts of the Fresh Meat Industry</h3>
<p>The Fresh Meat Industry Association of this city voluntarily donated money to purchase the "Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry aircraft." According to the representative of the association at the meeting, the association will stipulate donation methods, and plans that within one year, each store will pay 10 cents for the aviation saving the nation fund for each pig slaughtered, which will be collected by the pig merchants on their behalf. If the money cannot be collected in full within one year, then other methods will be set up to achieve the goal of collecting 100,000 yuan to purchase an aircraft within one year.</p>

<h3>External Communication</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, regarding the participation of the Products Association in the Chicago World's Fair, sent a note to the American Minister to China on the 22nd of this month, stating: "The Chinese government previously notified its intention to participate in the Chicago World's Fair on April 2, 1931. Now, our government has changed the method of participation, with merchants organizing a Products Association under government guidance to participate and assist in this grand event. This special note is to request that this information be conveyed to the appropriate parties. Minister Luo Wengan."</p>
<h3>Telegram to the Nation</h3>
<p>(Salutations omitted) It is known to all, both domestically and internationally, that our country's participation in the Chicago World's Fair has been in preparation for a long time.

<p>Suggestions from Two Organizations</p>
<h3>Two Major Proposals for Saving the Nation</h3>
<p>The 26th Branch of the First Special District City Federation and the Jiangxi Road Business Community Federation sent an important recommendation letter yesterday to the City Federation and other organizations. Here is the original letter divided into sections.</p>
<h3>Rent Contributions for Aviation Funds</h3>
<p>The Battle of Shanghai on January 28th, the market strike against resistance, lasted for three months. The most vibrant districts have been devastated. Survivors after the war, the movement to reduce rent can ease the burden on the people. Since the municipal government issued the rent exemption measures, the central district and other areas have not been treated fairly. Fortunately, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters forwarded the issue to the central government, and the rent reduction measures are being revised. However, it should not be delayed for too long, as it would lose the people's trust. In view of the pressing foreign invasion and the perilous state of the nation, we should learn from the lessons of the Air Force and strive for national salvation. Aviation to save the country, empty talk cannot become a reality. It is necessary to raise considerable funds. Then, regardless of the type of aircraft, it can soar into the sky. Now, the rent for the Shanghai war that has not been waived should be uniformly exempted. The resulting funds should be used as aviation expenses. The matter concerns national salvation, we will do our utmost to follow. But the municipal authorities should lead by example, and hope that the matter will be discussed and submitted to the authorities for implementation.</p>
<h3>Economic Sanctions Must Prevent Traitorous Merchants</h3>
<p>The Japanese army invaded our territory, using poison gas and air force to wreak havoc on the people. How can the descendants of the Yellow Emperor accept such humiliation? We vow to resist. While our armed comrades are fighting on the battlefield, we unarmed citizens can only implement economic sanctions to express our conscience. However, economic sanctions must stop the source. The only way is to prevent the transportation by traitorous merchants. If the source can be cut off, it is advisable to install secret report boxes for traitorous merchants everywhere, and to request the government to promulgate punitive regulations. Before the government promulgates regulations, the people should automatically be vigilant. This will not only show the national spirit, but also unite us to save the nation. We urge you to discuss and approve it.</p>
<h3>Sinking of the Yutong Steamer</h3>
<p>Company Seeks Rescue</p>
<p>Crew Reported Safe</p>
<p>The Yutong steamer of Yuda Company ran aground on Qixing Reef outside Xinghua, Fujian, the day before yesterday at about 7 a.m. These details were already noted in yesterday's newspaper. Here are the additional details obtained yesterday.</p>
<h3>Naval Department Sends Ship for Protection</h3>
<p>The Yuda branch office on Yong'an Street received a telegram the day before yesterday about the accident of the Yutong ship outside Xinghua. The company requested the Shipping Association to telegraph the Shanghai office of the Naval Department and the Fujian Naval Department to send a ship for protection. Yesterday we heard that the Naval Department had already telegraphed nearby patrol ships to rush to protect it.</p>
<h3>Insurance Company Salvages</h3>
<p>The ship had previously insured a peace insurance with Lianbao Company for 120,000 yuan (yesterday's newspaper mistakenly stated 120,000 taels). The company has now notified Lianbao Company, and the insurance company has contacted the Japanese salvage company yesterday to arrange salvage procedures due to the relationship of responsibility. It is learned that the salvage company has telegraphed the Moji Company and heard that the Oura Maru salvage ship has been designated to go to the scene of the accident to investigate, but the ship will not arrive until next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Yutong's Situation Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, Yuda Company received another telegram from the Xinghua agency, which stated that the first and second holds of the ship had been flooded with 1.2 feet of water, and there was still no news of the goods being taken out. It is hoped that there will be no strong winds in the next few days, so it will not capsize. The company then telegraphed to inform them that Japanese ships had been sent from Moji to rescue them.</p>
<h3>Crew Not in Danger</h3>
<p>The senior crew members of the ship are all Japanese, including the shipowner Sanshen Longxiong, the first mate Marukawa Fuji'erlang, the second mate Chinese (because the name is unknown due to recent change), the engineer Ise Zhongcang, the chief manager Li Wenjin, the second manager He Zhendong, four helmsmen, eight sailors, eight stokers, four oilers, fourteen clerks, and ten servants, a total of fifty-four people. According to the company's news, about a part of the crew has arrived in Xinghua, and it is also said that this Yutong accident, the ship may be unsalvageable, and the crew will not be in danger.</p>
<p>The City Federation will hold tomorrow</p>
<h3>National Goods Movement Propaganda</h3>
<p>And Fill in the Oath to Not Buy or Sell Enemy Goods</p>

The association has now scheduled to publicly promote the National Goods Movement Propaganda Week at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce tomorrow (Monday) at 3 pm, and has formulated a pledge form for stores to not sell or buy enemy goods to be issued to stores in each district to fill in. The oath says, "I, [name], hereby pledge to comply with the instructions of the National Goods Movement Committee of the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of Shanghai, and will strive to promote national goods and never buy or sell enemy goods in the future.

It is expected that the number of votes cast this year will be even more enthusiastic. The association's election documents are recorded separately as follows.</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Government and Others: The association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, our association's 12th election is scheduled to vote from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm on March 27 and count the ballots from 9:00 am on March 28.

<p>Patriotic Youth Pan Hongsheng</p>
<h3>Not Released After Serving Sentence</h3>
<p>His Family Asks Citizens' Association for Assistance</p>
<p>The six patriotic people, Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songshou, Tian Shuiyang, Zhu Erkang, and Xia Zida, were arrested by Gordon Road detectives and sent to court for throwing bombs on Kangnao Road in Shanghai West on November 29th last year to warn Yuanchang Foreign Goods Store. Liu Chongwu was sentenced to seven years in prison, and the other five people, including Pan Hongsheng, were sentenced to two to three months in prison. Among them, Pan Hongsheng has served his sentence and should be released immediately according to law. He is still being detained in the Tilanqiao West Prison. His family is extremely panicked. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District, requesting assistance. Here is the original letter: "Respectfully, my son Pan Hongsheng was arrested by the patrol room on November 29th last year on suspicion of throwing bombs. He was sentenced to three months in prison by the court and has served his sentence according to law, but he has not been released. He is in prison, and the suffering is indescribable. My son was motivated by the patriotic movement and acted out of conscience. Since he has been imprisoned, but has not been released after serving his sentence, what is the purpose? It is contrary to the principles of justice. I earnestly request that your association have compassion on my son, who has been imprisoned for his patriotic actions, and has suffered injustice. I implore you to negotiate with the court quickly and release him to maintain the lives of the people. With great anticipation, I respectfully submit this letter to the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of Shanghai. Respectfully, Pan Shunqing."</p>
<p>US on</p>
<h3>Total Far East Trade Volume</h3>
<p>丨One-Third Reduction Compared to Last Year丨</p>
<p>According to the Great American Evening News, according to the United States Department of Commerce, the total amount of US trade with the Far East last year was worth US$679,330,000, which is nearly one-third less than the US$995,230,000 in the previous year. From this, it can be seen the impact of the world economic downturn, exchange rate fluctuations, and the sharp decline in the purchasing power of the people in most countries in the Far East. Other factors such as increased tariffs, falling prices, and the instability of the political situation in China and India also play a significant role. Last year, US imports from the Far East were worth US$357,818,000, while the previous year it was US$573,632,000, a decrease of 73% compared to 1929. The value of imports in 1929 was 34% less than the average value between 1915 and 1919. Last year, US exports to the Far East were worth US$321,451,000, a decrease of 23.7% compared to US$425,780,000 in the previous year, and a decrease of 60% compared to 1929. The value of exports in 1929 was 43% less than the average value between 1915 and 1919. From this, it can be seen that the US trade with the Far East was sluggish last year. Last year, US exports to China were worth US$67,052,000, a decrease of 41.7% compared to the previous year. Exports to Japan were worth US$134,537,000, a decrease of 13.6% compared to the previous year. Exports to the Philippines were worth US$44,987,000, a decrease of 8% compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Nanyang</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Tobacco Factory Strike</h3>
<p>Satisfactory Results of Yesterday's Interrogation</p>
<p>Four Measures Agreed Upon, Provisional Conclusion</p>
<p>Arrested Workers Released, Entering Factory Tomorrow</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, a major strike occurred at Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company due to the workers organizing a union office, resulting in the detention of seven workers, which has resulted in a serious situation. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, Party and government organs specially convened an interrogation of both parties at the Social Affairs Bureau. The labor representatives Zhang Zhang and Wu Jiuzhang, and the capital representatives Liang Zhenqing and Chen Deshen were present. The meeting was chaired by Wang Xianqing, director of the Mediation Section of the Third Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhang Sheng, a member of the Civil Training Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters, attended as an observer. First, the chairman immediately inquired about the circumstances of both parties. The labor representative stated that the company interfered with the organization of the union and illegally instructed the police to detain the workers. The capital representative then stated that the factory did not oppose the workers' union, and it was also possible to negotiate on the proposed conditions according to the procedures. As for the police detention of the workers, the labor side said that it was instructed by the factory, which is absolutely untrue. If the workers do not beat the staff and do not disturb order, they will never be arrested, but they do not know whether the union is a legal organization. The representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters immediately replied that it was indeed approved by the Party Headquarters in accordance with legal procedures. The chairman then said to both parties that today, they will inquire about the beating problem in order to solve it first. As for the proposed conditions and whether the procedures are legal, they will not be discussed for the time being. I hope that the capital side will care for the workers, and the labor side will understand and cooperate with the capital side. The following four measures are proposed, and both parties are requested to accept them: (1) The arrested workers will wait for the court to release them (the Party and government have consulted the court to handle it) (2) The conditions proposed by the labor side will be temporarily withdrawn and submitted to the Municipal Party Headquarters for review and then proposed (3) The capital side's use of force to suppress workers should be revoked immediately (4) The workers should be well-behaved and not be used by others. If the above four points are accommodated by both parties, the strike can be temporarily concluded, and all workers will enter the factory as usual next Monday. After the chairman finished speaking, both parties expressed satisfaction, and the strike came to an end.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Again Requests Exemption</p>
<h3>Autumn and Winter House Donations for Jiangwan Last Year</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a letter to the Municipal Government, again requesting exemption from the autumn and winter house donations for Jiangwan last year. The original letter said, "Submitted for request, it is found that the case of the Shanghai war zone requesting exemption from the house donations for the two seasons of autumn and winter in the 21st year was submitted by the association based on the letter from the Wusong sub-office in October last year. After submission, the government approved and instructed that the house donations for the spring and summer seasons in the war zone have been exempted. The request is a general case and is difficult to approve, etc., and the instructions have been followed in separate letters. Now, on the 23rd of this month, the Jiangwan sub-office of the association stated in its letter that after the Shanghai war, 19 towns in Jiangwan were reduced to ashes. After the ceasefire agreement was concluded, merchants returned to their hometowns to clean up the debris, which was in the late summer and autumn. Therefore, the actual resumption of business was mostly at the end of the year, and the municipal government clearly ordered the exemption of taxes and donations, only covering the spring and summer. The merchants in this district have not benefited. On the 18th of this month, the association and the Wusong sub-office jointly presented a letter to the municipal government, and Chen, the clerk, was sent to receive it, and agreed to forward it. However, this case is a fundamental interest of the merchants in the Wusong and Jiangwan districts, and a written request is made again for verification. Please observe the hardships of the merchants in this district and forward it to the municipal government for exemption to maintain the difficulties of the people." According to this, it is found that the city's war zone has stipulated the method of reducing and exempting house donations, originally limited to the spring and summer seasons. However, Jiangwan is the center of the war. In the spring, it was under shelling. In the summer, the ceasefire agreement was just signed. During these two seasons, there was no house donation to speak of. It was not until cleaning up the debris and slowly seeking business resumption that most of them were in autumn and winter. If we rush to order the collection of donations in accordance with the regulations when this remnant breath has just stabilized and the vitality has not recovered, the merchants will not be able to reach it. The request to exempt the house donations for the autumn and winter seasons last year really has the hardship of having no choice, and it seems that it cannot be treated with routine. It is reasonable to submit a request to the government for verification and permission, which is convenient for the public.</p>
<p>Medical Team of the Chinese Relief Association</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Telegraphed Welcome</h3>
<p>Designated Jixian Location for Treating Wounded Soldiers</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram from the military committee branch, the medical team of the Chinese Relief Association has prepared to go north to handle medical affairs and treat wounded soldiers and civilians. The association also received a telegram from Representative Sun Longji yesterday from General Song Zheyuan, which stated, "To Representative Sun Longji, your telegram has been noted. The Shanghai Chinese Relief Association plans to send personnel north to set up a hospital to relieve the wounded soldiers, care for the injured, and be most admired. Please come to Jixian and contact Director Xie. Please convey this and express my gratitude." After receiving the telegram, the association prepared the luggage and is approved to depart on the 28th. However, the material aspects are extremely difficult, and there is also a concern that the medicines are insufficient. Special commissioners are sent to various parties to request assistance in order to get a full supply and avoid the danger of exhausting the aid. If all sectors of society are willing to donate voluntarily, please send them directly to the association's office at the intersection of Love Asia Road and Tibet Road, or submit them to the Jincheng Bank on Jiangxi Road for collection and transfer.</p>

Zhu was seriously injured, and his life was in danger, and Ren Zhenxiang, the Standing Committee of the 20th branch of the district, was also beaten and humiliated. He has been summoned by the Public Security Bureau, and I sincerely request that you transfer the letter to arrest the murderer and release him." Accordingly, I have copied and attached the original letter from the District Party Headquarters for your verification and instruction to arrest the main culprit of the murder and release Ren Zhenxiang, who was beaten and summoned, to maintain the labor movement.</p>

<p>Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<h3>Political Views of Council Candidate Lei Wen</h3>
<p>| Does Not Advocate for Immediate Tax Increases |</p>
<p>Ten candidates for the Shanghai Municipal Council have successively published their opinions on municipal affairs, which were recorded in this newspaper on the previous two days. Yesterday, American candidate Lei Wen also published his political views, stating roughly that although Shanghai's taxes are very low compared to other similarly prosperous cities around the world, he opposes immediate tax increases during this period of economic recession. He would rather issue public bonds to cover special expenses. The police, fire brigade, and sanitation department should all have their vacancies filled. No more large sums of money should be allocated for the construction of new roads or the extension of old roads in the coming year, but existing roads must be repaired on time and widened and straightened whenever possible. All municipal affairs must be maintained effectively, but at the same time, vigorous efforts must be made to practice economy. A solution to the issue of roads built beyond the concession must be found within the coming year, so that roads can be repaired and the convenience of telephones and water and electricity can be improved.</p>

<p>Shocking News</p>
<h3>Poisonous Substances Found in Japanese Goods Shipped to China</h3>
<p>Some time ago, newspapers in Wuhan reported that compatriots residing in Japan had found an English letter in the Drunken Weng Pavilion restaurant in Yokohama. The letter stated that the Imperial Japanese Military Medical School had established a Poison China Expedited Drug Research Society to place substances in gauze, cotton textiles, and daily necessities sold in China to spread epidemics. Their intentions are extremely vicious. The translated version of the original letter is as follows: Dear friends, Salerm Laisen. I am currently residing in Osaka and have learned of a most accurate matter, which I present to you for your special attention. Japan's invasion of China is an active and unremitting endeavor. During October 1931, the Imperial Japanese Military Medical School established a Poison China Expedited Drug Research Society. The purpose is to use scientific methods to place all kinds of toxins into necessities for human consumption. Some of the toxins cause permanent infertility (i.e., toxins hidden in clothing materials), while others cause cholera (such as adding such germs into cosmetics or utensils). Their malicious intentions to harm the Chinese people can be seen. However, we who reside in China must also be careful. In addition to my telegraphing the government to alert the people, I hereby inform you. I wish you good health. Sincerely, Jia Maseqi.</p>

<h3>Fare Increase for Chinese Tramways</h3>
<p>Starting next month, the first and second class fares will increase by two copper coins.</p>
<p>According to a Shinshi Telegraph Agency local news report, the Nanshi Water and Electricity Company has not increased its fares in the past three years. Recently, due to the depreciation of copper coins, it has become difficult to maintain all expenses. Therefore, it applied to the Public Utilities Bureau for permission to increase fares to maintain operations. It is now learned that the Public Utilities Bureau believes that the application is factual and has approved the company to increase the fares for first and second class by two copper coins each, starting from the first day of next month.</p>
<h3>Gang Fight Between Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>Using Bricks and Wooden Sticks as Weapons</p>
<p>Resulting in Multiple Injuries on Both Sides</p>
<p>Between Avenue Edward VII and Rue de Hartong and Route Say Zoong in western Shanghai, a major fight broke out yesterday at 10:45 AM between the rickshaw gang and the cart gang. The cause of the fight had been brewing for a long time, but the main reason was still competition for business. Yesterday morning, over a hundred rickshaw pullers gathered near the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue de Hartong. When they saw five or six carts working in the direction of Route Say Zoong at around 10 AM, they each grabbed bricks and rushed toward the cart pullers. At the time, there were also forty or fifty cart pullers, each holding bamboo poles to fight back. A chaotic battle ensued, with shouts shaking the sky, disrupting traffic and causing considerable disorder. The melee lasted for about a quarter of an hour. The Jing'an Temple Road police station, having received a report, dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives and police cars to the scene and immediately ordered arrests. Seeing the detectives arrive, the rickshaw pullers scattered, and over thirty people and twenty rickshaws were seized on the spot and taken to the police station for detention. Among the thirty-odd people arrested, nine were injured, but the injuries were minor. However, the fact is that at around 8 AM yesterday morning, the Gongda Freight Automobile Company of Zhoujiaqiao in western Shanghai loaded a large quantity of bricks and tiles from the Zhensou Brick and Tile Company in Caojiadu, intending to transport them to the Yuanhechang yard at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road. Unexpectedly, when they were about to reach their destination, they suddenly encountered over a hundred human-powered rickshaws transporting bricks and tiles from the White Railing to the Yongchangtai yard in western Jing'an Temple. When the rickshaw pullers saw the Gongda automobile, they swarmed forward to stop the automobile from unloading. The escorts and drivers of the automobile, seeing the rickshaw pullers obstructing them unreasonably, stepped forward to reason with them. Words quickly escalated into a mutual brawl, resulting in injuries on both sides. Nearby police officers, hearing the commotion, arrived and arrested everyone involved, taking them to the police station. The police chief ordered them to reconcile outside, but the Gongda Freight Automobile Company immediately reported the incident to the Shanghai Freight Automobile Industry Association and hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Gu Rumei, Hu Xiaodazi, and other rickshaw pullers who instigated the violence.</p>
<p>Miao Qinghe</p>
<h3>Death by Eating Pufferfish Roe</h3>
<p>Whole Body Numb, Jumping Like Thunder</p>
<p>Seized Up Like Electrocution, Died Untreated</p>
<p>Miao Qinghe, a 45-year-old man from Ningbo, lived at No. 161 Dengtuo Road and sold spiced beans for a living. He usually enjoyed a drink. At around 10 AM the day before yesterday, Miao bought two large pieces of pufferfish roe at the market and took them home. After cooking them, he used them as snacks to go with his wine, eating half of the roe. Initially, he did not feel anything, but unexpectedly, at around 6 PM, Miao suddenly became numb all over, jumping like thunder, as if he had been electrocuted. His wife, Zhu, was frightened and panicked when she saw this and immediately sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He suddenly died at around 11 PM. According to the hospital doctor's diagnosis, it was indeed caused by eating too much pufferfish roe. The hospital then reported it to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to the Pielun Road autopsy station. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court was requested to appoint Prosecutor Guo Wei, forensic doctor Zhang Yan, and clerk Wang Zuyi to go to the station to examine the body. Taking the bench, he questioned the deceased's wife, Miao Zhu, who testified, "My husband bought sorghum wine and pufferfish roe from the market that day and told me to cook it for him to eat. I and others do not like to drink wine, so only he ate it alone. But I did not know that eating this product could cause death, so I did not stop him at the time," and so on. After hearing the testimony, Guo Jun ordered the examination to confirm that the deceased, Miao Qinghe, had indeed died from poisoning after eating pufferfish roe. The body was handed over to his wife, Miao Zhu, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial, pending further investigation and verification.</p>

<h3>Female Worker Hangs Herself in Resentment</h3>
<p>| Jiang Genxiong Died a Pitiable Death |</p>
<p>Jiang Guisheng, a porter at a coal store who hailed from Gaoyou, lived in a side room at No. 34 Laoxiaopilu Lane in Nanshi. His wife, Jiang Shen, rowed a small boat in the Huangpu River. They had a total of five children. Their eldest daughter, Jiang Jindi, was married in the Zhonghua Road area of Xiaoximen. The family also included a second daughter named Genxiong, who was eighteen years old. Life was difficult for the family. Since the eldest daughter worked at the Jiucheng Stocking Factory on Penglai Road, she took her younger sister Genxiong there to learn the trade last winter. She had already completed her apprenticeship and was now working at the factory. On the 23rd of this month, Jiang Genxiong was ordered to pay compensation by the factory because the stockings she wove were too sparse.</p>
<p>Robbery to Buy Clothes</p>
<h3>Store Clerk Detects and Arrests</h3>
<p>Four Male and Female Thieves Arrested</p>
<p>Handguns, Bullets, and Stolen Goods Seized</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, at 8:30 PM, the Wanyuanxin Sauce Garden opened by Zhang Ming, a resident of Zhapu, at No. 44 Houjie Xiejiaodong Lane, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Nanshi, was robbed. Details were recorded in this newspaper yesterday. It is now learned that the robbers were caught on the previous two days, and handguns, bullets, and stolen goods were seized. Details are listed below.</p>
<p>Thieves Hide Out The male and female robbers fled to the Jiuhua Hotel at No. 60 Jinshouli, Shandong Road, W马 Road, in the Public Concession with the stolen goods. They rented rooms 28 and 34, divided the loot, and converted the clothes and gold jewelry into cash.</p>
<p>Buying Clothes One of the robbers, wearing a gray western-style raincoat over a bronze-colored silk robe, and a female robber, wearing striped clothes, went to the Hongfu Clothing Store at the intersection of Fujian Road (i.e., Shilu) and L马 Road at 1:45 PM the day before yesterday to buy clothes. They were greeted by the store clerk, Ren Binlai, who showed them a small cotton jacket, but because the quality was not good, they argued with Ren Binlai.</p>
<p>Clerk Detects the Deception The Hongfu Clothing Store had a clerk from Zhapu named Lu Changlin, who lived upstairs from Zhang Ming's Wanyuanxin Sauce Garden at No. 44 Houjie Xiejiaodong Lane, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Nanshi, which was also robbed. At the time, Lu was standing next to the counter, carefully looking at the customers, and they looked very much like the robbers. He then heard them speaking with a Jiangbei accent and saw that the raincoat had a lot of mud on the back.</p>
<p>Details of the Capture Lu Changlin saw that the robbers did not buy the clothes and turned to leave, so he followed them to Jinshouli Lane, W马 Road, Shandong Road. The male and female robbers then went out again and passed the entrance of the Gongtai Clothing Store on S马 Road, Fujian Road. Lu Changlin then called out to Chinese constable No. 530 there. The male robber was arrested on the spot, and the female robber escaped from the crowd.</p>
<p>Taken Back for Interrogation Detectives from the Lao Zha Police Station interrogated them briefly. Because the incident occurred in the Chinese area, they notified the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Detective Team Leader Lu Ying dispatched Wu Xiufeng, the leader of the team stationed in the Second District, with a document to take the robber back to the team for interrogation. The robber confessed, "Zhu Jinshan, 34 years old, from Qingjiang, admits to colluding with others to commit robbery with guns." Stolen goods were found on him. He also confessed the hiding place of his accomplices.</p>
<p>Continued Arrest of Accomplices After reviewing the confession, Lu Ying immediately dispatched detective leaders Zhou Peisan and detectives Wu Zuorong and Lu Zhenyuan to escort the Zhu suspect to the concession to meet with Chinese and foreign detectives from the police station. They went to rooms 28 and 34 of the Jiuhua Hotel at No. 60 Jinshouli, W马 Road, Shandong Road, and arrested two robbers: Liu Youcai, 40 years old, from Huai'an, and the female robber, Shen Yueshi, 34 years old, from Huai'an. Stolen cash totaling 30 yuan, 84 jiao in double coins, and 24 jiao in single coins, 23 pawn tickets, and leather clothing and other items were seized on the spot.</p>
<p>Strict Interrogation During the interrogation of the robbers, the team summoned the victims to the team to identify the robbers, who were confirmed to be them. The robbers also confessed to using the stolen goods and confessed that two handguns were hidden in the Ma Carriage Company at No. 151 Meixie Road in Nanshi. Lu sent the original team of detectives to go to the address with police officers from the Second District at around 12:00 PM yesterday to search and seize two handguns and twelve bullets. They also arrested Feng Wangshi, a 20-year-old woman from Qingjiang, and took her to the team for detention and interrogation. It is reported that the detectives will go to the various pawnshops today to track down the stolen goods and continue to arrest the remaining fugitives. They are temporarily being held in the team.</p>
<h3>Jumping into the Huangpu River Afraid of the Cold</h3>
<p>Young Lin Wenfu Was Fortunately Saved</p>
<p>At around 5 PM the day before yesterday, a young man hired a No. 360 sampan at the Zhaofeng Road Wharf in Hongkou, claiming that he was crossing to Pudong. The sampan operator, Lin Xingru, immediately cast off and rowed towards the opposite bank. Unexpectedly, when he reached the middle of the river, the young man suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. His body sank and then floated up again. The sampan operator was shocked and used a bamboo pole to try to save him. The young man grabbed the bamboo pole and was pulled back onto the boat. He was then sent to the Customs Water Police Station. He identified himself as Lin Wenfu, 18 years old, from Fujian. He refused to reveal the reason for his suicide attempt. When police officers asked why he grabbed the pole to get back on the boat if he wanted to commit suicide, his answer was quite amusing. He claimed that the water in the Huangpu River was very cold and he could not bear it, so it was not worth dying. Those who heard this were amused. When asked where he lived and whether he had any relatives or friends in Shanghai, he replied that he had no address, only a friend named Peng Demao who lived in the Xinkaihe area. The police station then sent Detective Huang Songsheng to the address to summon his friend to come and take him back.</p>

<h3>Emergency Meeting on Refusal to Cut Off Water</h3>
<p>| Residents in the Water Cut-off Area Drink Unclean Water and 19 Became Ill |</p>
<p>The Eastern Shanghai District Citizens' Committee for Refusing to Cut Off Water held an emergency meeting yesterday at 5 PM to discuss solutions, based on reports from residents in the water cut-off area. Chairman Qiu Jialiang chaired the meeting, and the following resolutions were passed: Representatives of residents in flat houses along the corner of Qiwupu Road and Baikai'er Road came to the meeting and claimed that after the water company closed the main switch, the landlord prohibited tenants from opening it. If they opened it without permission, they were threatened with the renovation of the house. Moreover, there were no public water hydrants nearby, so they had no way to get water. They could only draw water from the natural well behind the house. The well water was extremely muddy and very unsanitary, causing 19 residents there to become ill. They requested assistance from the committee. The committee believed the situation was serious and immediately sent a letter to the Real Estate Industry Association, urgently warning the landlord to protect people's lives and actively appealing to various organizations for assistance. The meeting adjourned at 7 PM.</p>

<p>The Truth Is Unclear</p>
<h3>Empty Wooden Box Scam</h3>
<p>Only One of the 26 Wooden Boxes Contained Rayon</p>
<p>The Other 25 Boxes Contained Wood Shavings and Brick Mud</p>
<p>The Purpose Was to Switch Goods and Defraud Customs</p>
<p>According to Song Bingzheng and Ye Yuxi, drug enforcement detectives, and Xu Guirong, a detective, from the Drug Enforcement Group of the Public Concession Police Department, there was a report that prohibited drugs were hidden in the Wufeng Customs Brokerage at No. 41 Yuegui Lane, Guangdong Road. The chief reported it and applied to the First Special District Local Court for a search warrant. They went to the customs brokerage at 2:30 PM the day before yesterday to conduct a search. They found 26 wooden boxes. The detectives, wanting to know what kind of items were stored in the boxes, opened and inspected each box. Unexpectedly, 25 of the boxes contained worthless items such as wood shavings and brick mud. Only one box contained rayon. The detectives were puzzled by their purpose. They arrested four people with close ties to the wooden boxes: Qian Hegeng from Yong, Xu Jingxiang, Qi Bingwen from Changzhou, and Monk Wang from Wuxi. They also took the wooden boxes back to the police station. Under investigation, it was learned that the purpose of preparing the wooden boxes was to defraud customs of goods. The method of deception was very thorough and rarely revealed any flaws, so it was usually not easy to solve the case. It is now known that to deceive and obtain certain goods, they would first prepare wooden boxes with the same decoration as the goods and report them to customs for shipment. When the goods left the customs warehouse, they would take the opportunity to switch them, replacing the real goods with fake ones. What other tricks they used are still under investigation by the detectives. The full story will be revealed in the future. Yesterday morning, the police sent Qian and the other four to the First Special Court. Judge Huang Risheng questioned them. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, and Zhang Shizhu, stated that they were prosecuting the four defendants for fraud. However, how the defendants were defrauding in this case is still under detailed investigation and should be adjourned to a later date. Judge Chen briefly questioned each defendant and ordered them to be detained pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Du Nanxi, a native of Sichuan, 26 years old, formerly studied in the Municipal Administration Department of Fudan University in Jiangwan. On the 21st of this month, he came to Shanghai by plane from Hankou and stayed at Fudan University, planning to marry his fiancée, Ding Yandao, who is currently working in the Education Bureau of Jinshan Zhu Jing, in Shanghai.

<p>New Bride</p>
<h3>Holding a Kitchen Knife to Chop at the Mother-in-Law's Head</h3>
<p>Romantic by Nature... Unaccustomed to Being a Wife</p>
<p>Transgressing Moral Standards... Sent to the Authorities for Investigation</p>
<p>Zhang Ji, a villager in Zhengang Township, the Third District of Shanghai County, comes from a family of modest means and has two sons, Fangsheng and Xiangsheng. Her husband died many years ago, and she relies on farming and weaving for a living. The elder son, Fangsheng, has been married for six years, and the younger son, Xiangsheng, was engaged to Da Jin, the daughter of Weng Qin, from the same township, through the introduction of Sun Guisheng when he was young. On the twenty-second day of the second month of the lunar calendar this year, Zhang Ji married Xiangsheng to complete the family. Unexpectedly, the wedding sedan was met with refusal. By midnight, the bride had not yet boarded the sedan. After receiving the news, Zhang Ji asked the township head, Jin Diangeng, to mediate. Only then was Da Jin brought home for the wedding on the morning of the next day. Unexpectedly, one wave had just subsided, and another rose. On the second day of the marriage, Xiangsheng's mother-in-law, Weng Qin, actually brought several armed men to Zhang's house to take Da Jin back. Later, local impartial people came forward to mediate, and the matter was finally resolved. According to Da Jin's usual behavior, she is very romantic and unaccustomed to being a wife. After six days in the same room, she returned home. At that time, it happened to be the local welcoming the gods festival. Da Jin went out and returned with her young boyfriend. Although Zhang Ji and Xiangsheng heard about it, they could not stop it. Yesterday, Zhang Ji went to Weng Qin's house to bring the new bride home to help with everything as the farm work was getting busy and to fulfill her wish of having a grandson as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, Da Jin, with her fierce and barbaric nature, grabbed a kitchen knife and chopped at her mother-in-law's head several times, causing Zhang Ji's face to be covered with blood and tears, and she fell to the ground in extreme pain. Neighbors came to help her home. Zhang's family and the elders of the village were indignant. Zhang Ji, having been chopped by the knife of her daughter-in-law, a matter that transgressed moral standards, reported the incident to the Zhuanqiao Police Station of the Third Public Security Bureau under its jurisdiction. After questioning by Chief Zhu, she was sent to the Third Public Security Bureau because the case concerned harm to a senior relative, and then sent to the County Government for legal investigation.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: The Shenbao, Xinwenbao, and Chengbao have reported for days that our bureau has dismissed a large number of staff and employees, and at the same time, it has newly appointed a large number of staff and employees. Although our bureau has repeatedly received orders from the Ministry of Railways to strictly reduce staff and reduce administration due to the financial difficulties of the two railways, the dismissal of the staff this time is not entirely based on austerity. In fact, some of them have been involved in corruption, or have weak knowledge and abilities, or are incompetent, or do not observe discipline. After careful investigation by the responsible officials, they had to be dismissed separately in order to rectify the situation. The newly appointed employees are mostly transferred from the Ministry of Railways and other departments. For example, Secretary Xiao Weiguo, Deputy Director of the General Affairs Department Yuan Boyang, Director of the Materials Department Sun Xuexiu, and Director of the Transportation Division Wang Yunyuan are all members of the Ministry. Director of the General Affairs Department Mo Heng is the technician and section chief of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, and Section Chief of the General Affairs Section Cao Shengzhi is the technician of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and concurrently the Deputy Director of the Ferry General Administration. They all have considerable positions and salaries, or still retain their original positions, so our bureau wants to rely on them and cannot but give them preferential treatment. Moreover, according to the regulations of the Ministry of Railways, the appointment and dismissal of staff and employees in our bureau, directors, deputy directors, secretaries, section chiefs, and employees of the same level are directly appointed by the Ministry, and the salaries of other staff and employees reaching one hundred yuan must be approved by the Ministry of Railways for appointment. In addition, if the public expenses paid reach ten yuan, it must also be approved by the Ministry. In addition, the appointment and dismissal of police officers in the police department are directly managed by the Railway Police Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. The director of the bureau cannot interfere. Only the staff and employees whose salaries are less than one hundred yuan can the director of the bureau freely appoint and dismiss. Therefore, the director of the Lianglu Bureau's employment rights are subject to strict restrictions. The staff who have been dismissed now know this procedure, but they generally say that the director dismissed 61 old employees and appointed 57 new employees, hoping to stir up gossip from all sides. This alone proves what kind of people they are. Taking the so-called dismissal of 61 old employees, only 22 of them were directly dismissed by the bureau. 28 were directly approved by the Ministry for dismissal. The remaining 11 were either resigned, dismissed by the police department, or even fabricated. Furthermore, among the so-called 57 newly appointed personnel, only 12 were directly appointed by the bureau, and 24 were directly appointed by the Ministry. The remaining 21 were either promoted from existing employees, appointed by the police department, or even fabricated. Furthermore, the Materials Department and the General Affairs Department's General Affairs Section are the only ones with more changes, precisely because these two parts are the hotbeds of corruption. Therefore, the Ministry specifically transferred Technician Sun Xuexiu to be the Director of the Materials Department and borrowed Technician Cao Shengzhi from the Shanghai Municipal Government to be the Section Chief of the General Affairs Section, ordering them to be responsible for sorting out the situation. There is no major change in other departments such as the General Affairs Department's Document Section. Wu Xiwei, the Section Chief of the Document Section, was promoted from the staff of the Industry Section. As for the pension savings, unless they are dismissed or have unfinished business in office, once the responsible official reports it, the Ministry of Railways specifically appoints the road inspector to audit it and confirm that there are no errors, and the accounting department will allocate it. The director of the bureau cannot arbitrarily issue or withhold it. Therefore, various parties have inquired about this matter to our bureau, and we cannot answer each one in detail. Therefore, we have specifically stated the facts in a nutshell, and we hope that your newspaper will publish this letter to clarify the truth. Sincerely, The Jinghu-Huning and Huning-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, March 25th.</p>

<h3>Boy Scouts and the "New Mission"</h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. You Cheng of this Port丨</p>
<p>Since your esteemed newspaper began publishing the "Readers' Mailbox," the issues discussed have been numerous. However, there seems to be a lack of discussion regarding group activities. I am not talented, but I respectfully present the issue of the Boy Scout movement for readers to study and ask for space to express my humble opinions as follows.</p>
<p>Boy Scout education is flourishing today like bamboo shoots after rain. The leading organization should be fully sound to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, which lacked organization. During the January 28th Incident last year, the Shanghai Boy Scout Council was at the forefront, resolutely summoning the heads and trainers of Boy Scout troops in the city to face the national crisis. They organized a battlefield service corps, participating in the resistance against Japan at the front lines, rescuing victims in the rear, and serving in hospitals and shelters for wounded soldiers. Their work was indeed precise, brave, and diligent, demonstrating that Chinese youth truly bear a significant new mission of carrying on the past and opening up the future.</p>
<p>According to the principles of Boy Scout training, the focus of their spirit, the soundness of their bodies and minds, and their courageous, sacrificial, and sincere willpower are worthy of being models for Chinese youth. When we further observe the twelve Boy Scout laws – "Honest, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and civic-minded" – we gain a deeper understanding of the inherent character of the Boy Scouts and their spirit of wisdom, benevolence, and courage. These twelve laws are the only effective remedy for the youth of China. In terms of individuals, they cultivate talented individuals who are noble, physically sound, and knowledgeable. In terms of the nation, society, and humanity, they promote mutual assistance, peace, and universal love, gradually approaching the realization of a world of the people, by the people, and for the people. This further proves that Boy Scout training is an important element in saving the nation and is a formidable enemy of romanticism, frivolity, timidity, and melancholy. Therefore, the cultivation of such excellent youth naturally depends on talented individuals with experience, knowledge, and loyalty to take responsibility for molding them. Conversely, if there is a lack of sufficient experience and knowledge, and if the scum of society hastily and perfunctorily seek fame and praise by training these Boy Scouts, the result will only lead to the youth becoming undisciplined and impractical, causing profound harm... (End)</p>
<p>Answer: Your letter discusses the issue of Boy Scouts. However, more than ten years ago, as I served in the education field, I personally founded a Boy Scout troop. At that time, for the establishment ceremony of the Boy Scouts, everyone wanted me to write an introduction. Therefore, I had briefly investigated the history and social relations of the Boy Scouts. Today, I take this opportunity to share my current opinions on the Boy Scouts themselves. However, I must first declare that these are my personal opinions and not some "absolutely indisputable" theory. (1) I remember the origin and reasoning behind Boy Scouts: There was an Englishman (whether he was a military officer, a journalist, or a traveler, I don't remember) who saw in an African colony that the lives of the black soldiers in the army were very arduous, simply unbearable for white people, but the black people were at ease. The Englishman thought: If there is a war between England and the colony, that is to say, the colony rises up in resistance and England goes to suppress it, the English people, used to comfort, may not be confident of victory. So, after returning to England, he created an organization specifically to train young students in hardship and provide basic military training. Before long, this organization spread throughout the country and the world. This is the brief history of the so-called "Boy Scouts." Its initial purpose was only to organize a generation of youth to prepare for the armed suppression of colonial rebellions, the violent foundation of so-called "suppression of counter-revolution." (2) Boy Scouts are not a force in our Chinese patriotic youth's revolutionary war against Japanese imperialism. The Boy Scout uniforms are very neat, and during the war, they "rescue victims in the rear and serve on the battlefield," and that is all. However, the Chinese youth in our eyes are not like this. Our patriotic youth should take up arms themselves and fight to the death with Japanese imperialists and their running dogs, the traitors. However, the current Boy Scouts cannot do this kind of struggle. (3) The so-called creeds of the Boy Scouts, as you mentioned: "Honest, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and civic-minded," etc., are all abstract, intangible dogmas, just like the "propriety, justice, integrity, and shame" advocated by celebrities today, not concrete and actionable programs for our survival as a nation. The so-called "loyalty" is naturally copied from the ancient ministers' saying, "Advance in thought, exhaust loyalty; retreat in thought, make up for mistakes." But who should we be loyal to now? The so-called "obedience," who should we obey? And how should we fulfill loyalty? What are the standards for obedience? If you are working under a traitor, should you be loyal to him? Should you obey him? In this way, only simple-minded youth are created to be tools for a few people, which is truly undesirable. (4) Currently, I believe that truly patriotic youth should "rise up as a separate force" to organize a widespread and great armed mobilization group, or simply name it "Chinese Youth Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps." As long as they are patriotic youth, whether they are students, young clerks, young workers, or young farmers, as long as they sincerely dedicate themselves to this arduous struggle of resisting Japan and saving the nation, they are qualified to join. Its program should be approximately as follows: (1) Use your own brain, stand on the position of the vast majority of the people to think about everything, analyze everything, and study everything. (2) To be loyal, you should only be loyal to the country protected by the vast majority, and only be loyal to the revolutionary war against Japanese imperialism. To obey, you should only obey the organizations trusted by the revolutionary masses who protect the country and resist Japan. (3) Unite the vast majority of youth in the country to resist Japan with arms. (4) Universally implement military training: mechanical, chemical, and tactical. (5) Demand that the government issue weapons. (6) Undertake compulsory education for the majority of the poor, lecturing on the causes, situation, relationship, results, and responsibilities of the Chinese-Japanese war. (7) Study methods of resisting Japan and help the general public organize various anti-Japanese groups. (8) Lecture to the public on the prevention of poison gas and other necessary knowledge and skills that the general public should have during wartime, such as fire prevention, first aid, communication, stretchers, etc. (9) Should be deeply aware that only when the people of the whole country spontaneously and unitedly unite to become the main force in resisting Japan and take on the mission of resisting Japan will the resistance have active and real consciousness and hope. If they are merely weakly waving flags and shouting slogans in the rear, relying solely on a few soldiers to compete with Japan, not only will they not resolutely fight to the end, but even if they do fight to the end, they will only leave a tragic page in history! As for the Shanghai Boy Scouts' service on the battlefield in the past two years, they have made some contributions. This is not due to the effectiveness of the Boy Scouts but the result of a little national consciousness driving the Chinese people. To fulfill this little bit of obligation is not something only the Boy Scouts can do; ordinary young students can also do it. If you conclude from this that "Chinese youth truly bear a significant new mission of carrying on the past and opening up the future," are you not taking things too lightly? And what is the so-called carrying on and opening up, what exactly will be carried on and what will be opened up? Where is the so-called "new mission"? May I ask丨</p>

<p>Presidents of Private Middle Schools in Beijing</p>
<h3>Petition Again for Unified Examination</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Should Quickly Formulate Special Measures</p>
<p>Eight presidents or representatives of more than ten registered private middle schools in Beijing, including Yao Wencai, went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau on the afternoon of the 24th to petition for the unified examination. Director Wang Chongzhi received them. Because this matter needs to be formulated by the Ministry of Education in order to be implemented, the representatives went to the Ministry of Education at 5:00 PM. Division Chief Gu Yinting received them. The representatives said that after the Ministry of Education announced the unified examination measures, various provinces have special circumstances that can be remedied. Now, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have already held presidents' meetings to propose measures, and the Education Departments have detailed various regulations, but Beijing has not yet made any plans. The unified examination is approaching soon, so it is necessary to formulate regulations as soon as possible. What we request is: (1) Beijing should quickly organize an examination committee for this matter, so that practical educators can contribute appropriate opinions to the committee, and the selection of committee members should pay attention to the talents of the Beijing education community, so as to avoid separation. (2) The scope and standards of the examination should be based on the actual situation of each school. Because the new curriculum standards were only recently announced, the levels of the schools are very uneven. During the transition period, there should be a compromise remedy. (3) The scoring method should consider the overall situation and reduce the standard of passing scores separately, and the usual grades should also be stipulated to account for a certain percentage of the unified examination scores, so as not to completely obliterate the usual grades due to the length of one day. Division Chief Gu said that this matter must be formulated by the Beijing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau itself. The Ministry of Education had previously meant in a general meeting that it could be changed due to special circumstances. He agreed to urge the Social Affairs Bureau to formulate the unified examination measures as soon as possible in a private capacity and report them to the Ministry for review.</p>

<h3>Liu Changchun Can Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Intends to Obtain a Position in Shanghai</p>
<p>Hoping for Assistance from All Sectors</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Changchun, the only athlete representing the country at the World Games, currently resides in Beiping. He feels that the local environment is not good and fears that his original talent may be worn away and submerged due to a lack of practice. He intends to find a place to stay in Shanghai, so that he can learn from and improve with famous athletes in East China. He has sent letters to various friends in Shanghai, asking for introductions. Mr. Cheng Yize, a famous and enthusiastic sportsman in this city, is also one of those entrusted. Mr. Cheng called this museum yesterday, stating the reason for Mr. Liu's coming to Shanghai, and hoping that all sectors will lend a helping hand, so that Mr. Liu will not be disappointed. The original letter is as follows: Sirs, recently I received a letter from Mr. Liu Changchun, the only athlete representing our country at the World Games, from Beiping. He deeply feels the bleakness of the sports circles there and the lack of opportunities and interest in practice, and fears that his personal useful talent will be worn away and submerged in the long run, which is a misfortune for the sports circles of our China. Therefore, he is eager to pack his bags and come here to learn from and improve with famous athletes in East China, hoping to receive the effect of other mountains. His ambition is far-reaching, his heart is long, and he is humble. His words do not abandon my own mediocrity, and he wants me to find him a place to stay to maintain his livelihood. In our country's sports circles, which are still in their infancy, at this time of global life panic, every talent often leaves school due to food and clothing, and then gradually degenerates, which is very regrettable. Now, even an athlete as agile as Mr. Liu cannot escape this example. I thought again and again, and I was eager to place Mr. Liu in an appropriate position, so that his skills can soar, and he can fulfill his strengths. But my current situation is different from the past, and there is no suitable position to accommodate Mr. Liu for a while, and I can't bear to leave it alone. My heart is uneasy and I can't control myself, so I specifically ask you to publish my letter, so that comrades in this city may be able to lend a helping hand, so that Mr. Liu can have no worries about living and can gain the benefits of learning in practice. In the future, those who gallop in the battlefield and vent their anger for my Chinese athletes are not only what I, one person, look forward to. If any of you readers have any advice, please send a letter or visit my residence on Matthew Hedgestone Road for a chat. Thank you very much.</p>

<h3>Western Police Win Over Youyou</h3>
<p>Result Eight to Three</p>
<p>Today Youyou Battles Jinan</p>
<p>丨3 PM at Yiyuan丨</p>
<p>The Youyou football team fought the Western Police at the Yiyuan Stadium yesterday. Two or three thousand people watched. Youyou goalkeeper Liang Guanlian has not recovered since his wrist was fractured in the battle with Lax at Hongkou Park a few days ago. Yesterday, Wang Caigao played in his place. Veteran forwards Ye Jinjin and Shi Jinsheng were also unable to play due to injuries. Yesterday, Lu Shifang and Mao Honggui were substituted. As a result, the forward strength was reduced, and Huang Ruihua also did not perform well, so the forwards could not respond, and the rear could not defend. Then, the Western Police won with a score of eight to three. The battle record yesterday is as follows.</p>
<p>Youyou Misses an Opportunity Once The Western Police kicked off and attacked first, approaching step by step. Jack tried a shot, and Wang Caigao saved it. Xi Qiaosheng sent the ball to the right. Chen Guangyi invaded along the side, rushed to the side of the goal, and shot hard at the goal. Western Police goalkeeper Bradly fell to the ground and pounced out, Chen added another kick, the ball brushed the door and crossed to the left, Sun Jinshun, fired again, into a corner kick, Chen Guangyao sent it out, and failed again.</p>
<p>Western Police Scores Two Goals in a Row After escaping danger, the Western Police led their troops to counterattack. Pete's pass was excellent, and De Fei greeted it with his head, hitting the corner of the goal squarely, which was very clear. Only ten minutes had passed since the start of the game. In the center kick-off, the Western Police went deep again, and the Youyou rear was in a rather scattered state. Turner passed the ball in front of the goal, and Pete shot it into the net. The two goals were less than two minutes apart.</p>
<p>Youyou Returns Two Goals After losing two goals, Youyou's morale was greatly boosted and their spirits were uplifted. Sun Jinshun's two shots were both saved. Li Shiyou dribbled the ball and advanced again, but was blocked by the enemy. However, the two defenders of the Western Police let each other save the ball, and Xi Qiaosheng reaped the benefits, stepping forward and shooting, succeeding in one fell swoop. Therefore, Youyou's momentum was strong, and the Western Police's goal was in constant danger. Sun Jinshun forced a corner kick, Li Shiyou's kick was good, but it did not yield any benefits. Then, Huang Ruihua passed the ball to the left, and Li Shiyou returned it to the front of the goal, Hu Youcheng kicked it successfully, shooting into the corner of the goal, making the score two to two.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Three More Cities Were Lost After tying the score at two to two, it was generally believed that Youyou could win. Unexpectedly, the Western Police refused to show weakness and were aggressive, and their arrogance was very high. Within a quarter of an hour, Youyou lost three more cities in a row. The Western Police took the lead with five to two, ending the first half. The shooters of the Western Police were (1) De Fei, (3) Pete, (3) Parker. As for the reason why Youyou lost, it was due to the fact that the rear could not connect and the formation was scattered.</p>
<p>Western Police Scores Two More Goals At the beginning of the second half, the Youyou front showed even more signs of depression. Chen Guangyao was ambushed on the border and was frustrated. Xi Qiaosheng and Hu Youcheng were quite negligent, Li Shiyou was trapped by the enemy, and Sun Jinshun was unable to do anything alone. Therefore, the Youyou rear was extremely tight, and the enemy's traces were densely distributed in front of the goal. After ten minutes of stalemate, Pete shot a side ball, De Fei rushed in, and the Western Police added another goal. After Parker missed two shots, Jack also rushed in a goal, making the score seven to two.</p>
<p>Iron Foot Shoots Through the Willow Under the threat of violence, Youyou had few opportunities to move. Only Chen Guangyao once had the opportunity to attack the goal, but because he was too hasty and his steps were not accurate, he shot wildly. Sun Tiezu felt hurt by the scene and struggled single-handedly, ignoring everything, charging left and right, and got the ball to shoot 25 yards away from the goal. It was almost a last resort to make a desperate gamble. Unexpectedly, the ball's path was excellent, hitting the corner of the goal squarely, and he was overjoyed. But before long, Western Police's Parker scored another goal, ending the game with a score of eight to three. The lineup is as follows.</p>
<p>Western Police</p>
<p>Bradly, Gregson, Shaw, France, Gash, Stogges, Turner, De Fei, Parker, Jack, Pete</p>
<p>Youyou</p>
<p>Wang Caigao, Wang Shusen, Yao Bin, Lu Fang, Huang Ruihua, Mao Honggui, Li Shiyou, Sun Jinshun, Hu Youcheng, Xi Qiaosheng, Chen Guangyao</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Suicide and Dreams</h3>
<p>— Si Su</p>
<p>The world of the twentieth century is, after all, not the ancient times. In ancient times, people did not know each other, and there was no "each other." Asia did not know there was Europe, and Europe did not know there was America. Even within the same Asia, most Chinese people could not clearly know there was India, but vaguely thought there was a Western Paradise. It was not easy for people like Bodhidharma from India to come to China, and it also became a historical adventure for people like Faxian and Xuanzang to go to India. Therefore, even neighboring countries like Japan were vaguely regarded as a paradise; it was not until the Six Dynasties that it became clear that it was also a country inhabited by humans. However, the relationship between the two sides was still subtle, only that Emperor Gao of Qi granted King Wu of Wa the title of General Who Pacifies the East. What era is it now! Even if Japan relies on its strength and believes that no one can harm it, and intends to turn the clock back to the ancient times and swallow China alone, just like the Yuan and Qing dynasties entering the Central Plains, no other continents or countries have ever interfered. However, the wheel of time only moves forward and does not retreat. Japan should regret that it became strong too late and did not catch up with the Yuan and Qing dynasties, or even earlier, before the Liao and Jin dynasties. Today, to try to turn the wheel of time backward is, in fact, impossible. Although it is strong, it is still only "relying on itself." Although it is implementing a reversal, it is still only "intending." When a financial crisis occurs in the United States, it is entirely the United States' own business, but the impact has reached far and wide, and no major city has not been affected. Today's world is largely one where a single hair can move the whole body. Even a small matter, as long as it is international in nature, can absolutely not be shut out. How much more so is the major event of swallowing China alone? Moreover, the complexity of the international situation within China is more dramatic than anywhere else in the world. Japan, relying solely on "self-reliance" and "intending" to follow in the footsteps of the Yuan and Qing dynasties, swallowing China alone and not allowing third-party interference; isn't this "self-reliance" and "intending" equal to "suicide" and "dreams"!</p>
<h3>書聲</h3>
<p>— 啟楣</p>
<p>Every time I walk past the gate of a private school, there's always a chorus of voices reciting from books, so noisy that it's impossible to make out a single word.</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child in a private school. This noisy recitation had one unique use. The tutor was an old man, frail and stooped. All day long, apart from the unavoidable lecturing and circling of characters, most of his time was spent on the bed. But he wasn't fast asleep; the moment the sound of the recitations stopped, he would immediately come out. So, we were forced to adopt this "shouting policy," taking turns to shout out loud. The noisy chorus served as our smoke screen for playing around. Speaking of the sounds of recitations, it reminds me of the street performers from Jiangbei. When they perform their magic tricks on the stage, there are always gongs and drums to add to the atmosphere, creating a deafening racket that makes your head spin. The performers themselves raise their voices even higher, gesturing wildly and chanting incantations. The clamor creates opportunities for sleight of hand. Once the gongs and drums stop, everything is over.</p>
<p>Isn't Japan doing the same thing now? Before covertly deploying troops to occupy a certain place, they always fabricate some facts, rambling on and on about all sorts of things, leaving you completely baffled. By the time the international community tries to pay attention, "the rice has already been cooked," and the plan has become a reality.</p>
<p>As for China? After the September 18th Incident, slogans like "long-term resistance," "sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall," "quietly awaiting resolution from the League of Nations," "pacifying internally before resisting externally," etc., sound rather confusing to those of us unfamiliar with logic. However, whether they are also adopting this "shouting policy" without actually implementing it is something only those important figures who have spoken know in their hearts.</p>

<p>丨幻滅的經過丨</p>
<p>丨The Process of Disillusionment丨</p>
<p>After several years of dedicated study in the New World, Mr. Yu obtained a doctorate in electrical engineering. Gilded with success, he returned to his homeland full of vigor. He wrote many papers, which were published in various prestigious journals, and his reputation gradually grew. Everyone in the national academic circle knew the great name of Dr. Yu Shifang.</p>
<p>The presidents of various universities expressed their admiration for Dr. Yu and vied to recruit him. Dr. Yu even held professorships at six universities simultaneously, traveling between ×××× several times a week. His monthly income, including writing fees, amounted to as much as eight or nine hundred yuan.</p>
<p>"Even heroes cannot escape the trap of beautiful women." The temptations of the typical New Era woman made Dr. Yu feel depressed and troubled, losing interest in life. Somehow, he formed a close friendship with Miss Huo, the most sought-after courtesan in ××.</p>
<p>From fame came gold, and from gold came beauty. Everything seemed to be a success.</p>
<p>×××××</p>
<p>Dr. Yu and Miss Huo's love was as sweet as honey. Cars, cinemas, upscale restaurants, dance halls – everything intoxicated them both. But the universities were waiting for Dr. Yu to lecture. No problem, he could ask friends to substitute. The monthly salary wasn't enough for Miss Huo's extravagant spending? No problem, he could borrow from friends.</p>
<p>The story of Dr. Yu's debauchery spread like wildfire. His friends no longer trusted him, and the university presidents no longer trusted him. He had borrowed all the money he could. As the second academic year began, no invitations from the universities arrived.</p>
<p>Dr. Yu's glory was not as bright as it once was, and his financial situation was dire. Miss Huo began to doubt him. Their honey-sweet love underwent a chemical reaction and turned as bland as water.</p>
<p>From beauty came the loss of fame, from the loss of fame came the loss of gold, and from the loss of fame and gold came the loss of beauty. Everything was shattered.</p>

<h3>浸禮</h3>
<h3>Baptism</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>A Western-style clock tower stands tall at the entrance; in the middle is a hall that can hold a thousand people, that is the well-known Christian church. Christianity is against the worship of idols, so one cannot find any decorations that represent God. A semi-circular pulpit is set up with a small table and a few chairs for the pastor's sermon. Below the platform lies a huge piano, surrounded by copper music stands for sheet music, as well as violins, clarinets, and copper drums; these are all for the choir. Beyond that are rows of benches, neatly arranged, for the listeners.</p>
<p>The large clock on the high tower, rings loudly; countless men, women, old and young, file into the church. Their solemn and pious appearances make you feel the wonders of religion. The old pastor on the platform has a kind face and an amiable attitude; his sincere tone truly represents the God of peace in heaven. Next is the hymn singing, beautiful string music accompanying the voices of the crowd: "Hallelujah, praise the Savior." It is like a group of angels singing. The old pastor closes his eyes and prays, the people below all stand together; they are also silent together, so quiet that almost everyone's breathing can be heard. "Amen" is said, and the congregation sits down.</p>
<p>The pastor begins to explain the reasons for the baptism, he says: "Jesus of the past also received baptism in the Jordan River. Now we believe in Jesus, so we must also be baptized, on the one hand to continue the work of Jesus; on the other hand to show that the old sins have been washed away, and new life has come again."</p>
<p>The believers being baptized, men and women, line up in front of the pastor. The pastor blesses them one by one. Then he tells them to separate into men's and women's changing rooms. At this time, the pool behind the platform is filled with warm water; the old pastor, wearing a sacred robe made of cowhide, stands in the water. The choir below is singing "Hallelujah, praise the Savior" in a melodious voice. The believers being baptized, one by one wearing single garments, stand in the water. The old pastor blesses them, one by one, they are immersed completely in the water, and then he helps them up, doing it in order. The baptism is over; the music has also stopped. The old pastor is exhausted; the baptized believers also seem to have taken a solemn cold bath.</p>

<p>Accumulating anger until his face turned red to the roots of his ears, Ji Zhi lowered his head and said, "She... she is also a good person..." Hou Zhi slammed his chopsticks and bowl down, placed both hands on the edge of the table, and looked at him, asking, "What good person? I must ask you to enlighten me, is she good because she runs around in the streets?" As he spoke, he turned to the old servant woman standing to the side and said, "In the future, if that poor girl comes, ignore her, just say whoever she's looking for isn't home." The old servant woman agreed. Hou Zhi was in such a rage that Mrs. Gan could only look at the two of them and smile. After a long while, she said, "There's no need to get so angry over this." She glanced at Hou Zhi, then smiled at Ji Zhi, saying, "Don't be impatient, if you want to find a wife, I can help you as your sister-in-law, I know people from all walks of life. That old maid, being from a poor family and lacking any modern knowledge, isn't a good match for you. Don't pay any attention to her." What else could Ji Zhi say? He could only quickly finish his meal and return to his own room. From afar, he could still hear his brother in the main room repeating "poor girl" over and over again. In his heart, he thought, "I didn't expect my brother to get so angry. Could it be that the Yang family has done something improper that he found out about?" To say that the old maid runs around in the streets is nothing important. First of all, that's how Manchu women are. Secondly, there are only a mother and daughter in her family, so either the mother or the daughter has to go out to buy things. There's nothing wrong with that. Even if the old maid has done something improper, well water doesn't interfere with river water, it has nothing to do with us. It's just that my brother said that if she comes in the future, we shouldn't pay attention to her. If she really comes and gets the cold shoulder, wouldn't she be embarrassed? The only thing to do is to tell her not to come anymore. But then again, how can I say such a thing to someone? Can I just plainly tell her, 'Don't come to my house anymore?' Doing it that way is worse than hitting her or scolding her. But if I don't say that, and she comes to the house and gets the cold shoulder, can I bear to let her suffer such a great loss? If that really happens, then we'll have to break off relations with each other." Ji Zhi thought and thought, but he couldn't come up with a solution. The incident hasn't even happened yet, and he's already in a dilemma. (23)</p>

<h3>鶴與蝦</h3>
<h3>The Crane and the Shrimp</h3>
<p>有一隻鶴，久住在池塘邊的樹上，那池塘裏生了許多魚蝦。鶴就靠魚蝦爲生的。後來鶴的年齡漸老，身體也不能行動，連魚也不能捕了，所以常常空腹飢餓，身體愈加瘦弱了。那鶴到了這時，想到：「年輕的時候，若是能夠多勞動，貯蓄了多少糧草自然不至有今日的樣子」心裏很懊悔過去的懶惰。某日，它在池塘邊彿徊，時時嘆息，忽然看見一隻蝦，那蝦問道：「鶴君，你爲什麽緣故，這樣頽喪呢？你不必呆想，趕緊去尋些東西吃吧，」鶴答道：「我的肚子，並不飢餓，我因爲想到今天早晨，有兩位漁夫到這裏來，有一位漁夫，想把這池塘的水車乾，還有一位漁夫主張想先把那邊的池塘的水車乾，大槪不久就要着手了。我聽到他們的話，一則很爲你魚蝦們憂慮，二則我也不能常常同你們在這裏爲友了，所以我的心裏很不安啊！」那蝦聽到這話，非常驚駭，就告訴那魚蝦們，那些可憐的魚蝦也很驚駭，立刻游泳到岸邊，請求那鶴想法子救它們的命，說道：「我們見了你，本來也是大仇敵，過去你戕殺我同胞們，不必再提起。不過古人有句話：窮鳥入懷，獵夫也不殺它的。現在情勢很緊，假使一旦漁夫來車乾這池塘的水，那末我們的生命都休了。我們若是都爲漁夫所捕，你豈忍心麽？所以應當爲我們想個法子，保全同胞的生命。」鶴答道：「我没有和漁夫對抗的能力，恐怕想不出來好的法子，不過漁夫去車乾那邊池塘的水，非一朝一夕的，須要幾個月工夫，我當盡力帶你們到别的池塘裏去吧。那魚蝦們一聽這話，都是非常喜歡，說道：「那末就請你帶我們去吧。」於是鶴就從這天起，開始搬魚蝦到他處去了。不料它每天早晨，　了二三尾的魚，飛到山上，把魚吃得乾乾凈凈。因此鶴的身體，也漸漸肥大，它以爲魚蝦們墮其彀中，從此都在它的掌中了。有一天，他照例的飛到池塘邊去　魚，看見有一隻大蝦等候。鶴就把蝦　到山上，那時這蝦看見地上有許多魚骨，知道以前鶴借代爲搬家爲名，都給它果腹了。它猛然的升開兩箝，箝住鶴的頭頸，鶴無法擺脫，一瞬之間，它的喉管被蝦箝斷，翻身死在地上。這時蝦雖不能在山上生活，然而已爲其他的魚蝦們報了大仇了。</p>
<p>There was a crane that lived for a long time on a tree by a pond. The pond was full of fish and shrimp. The crane relied on the fish and shrimp for food. Later, the crane grew old and could no longer move, so it could not catch fish, and was often hungry. Its body grew thinner. The crane thought at this point, "If I could have worked harder when I was young, I would have saved up a lot of food and would not be in this state today." It regretted its past laziness. One day, it paced back and forth by the pond, sighing from time to time. Suddenly, it saw a shrimp. The shrimp asked, "Mr. Crane, why are you so dispirited? Don't just stand there thinking. Go find something to eat." The crane replied, "My stomach isn't hungry. I was thinking that two fishermen came here this morning. One fisherman wanted to drain the pond, and the other advocated draining the pond over there first. They will probably start soon. When I heard their words, I was worried for you fish and shrimp, and also because I won't be able to be friends with you here for long. So, I am very uneasy!" When the shrimp heard this, it was very alarmed and told the other fish and shrimp. The poor fish and shrimp were also very alarmed and immediately swam to the shore and begged the crane to find a way to save their lives, saying, "When we see you, we are usually enemies. You have killed our fellow fish and shrimp in the past, but there is no need to mention that again. However, there is an old saying: 'A bird in distress, even a hunter will not kill it.' The situation is now very tight. If the fishermen come to drain the pond, then our lives will be over. If we are all caught by the fishermen, how can you bear it? Therefore, you should think of a way to save our fellow fish and shrimp." The crane replied, "I have no ability to confront the fishermen. I am afraid I can't think of a good way, but it will take months for the fishermen to drain the water from that pond. I will do my best to take you to another pond." When the fish and shrimp heard this, they were very happy and said, "Then please take us there." So, from that day on, the crane began to move the fish and shrimp to another place. Unexpectedly, every morning, it caught two or three fish, flew to the mountain, and ate the fish clean. Therefore, the crane's body gradually grew fatter. It thought that the fish and shrimp were in its grasp and that they were now all under its control. One day, as usual, it flew to the pond to catch fish, and saw a large shrimp waiting. The crane caught the shrimp and flew to the mountain. At that time, the shrimp saw many fish bones on the ground and knew that the crane was using the relocation as a pretext to fill its stomach. It suddenly opened its pincers and clamped the crane's neck. The crane could not get rid of it. In an instant, the crane's throat was cut off by the shrimp's pincers, and it fell to the ground and died. At this time, although the shrimp could not live on the mountain, it had avenged the great hatred for the other fish and shrimp.</p>
<h3>五指何故不齊</h3>
<h3>Why Are the Five Fingers Not the Same Length?</h3>
<p>人類的手，原來是爲走的作用，五個手指的長短不齊，就是爲支持重心的緣故。好比犬貓的趾爬行一般的，後來人體進化，漸漸的把原來的使用變更了。前脚（手）的爬行的效用，因代遠年深環境物質的關係，比後脚（足）愈加進步。後脚因爲專門用以走路的關係，慢慢的退化了。加以後脚的脚趾比前脚爲短，他的活動作用，當然要比前脚爲差啊。</p>
<p>The human hand was originally used for walking. The unequal length of the five fingers is for the sake of supporting the center of gravity. Like the toes of dogs and cats used for crawling, later, with human evolution, the original use gradually changed. The crawling function of the forelegs (hands), due to the distance of time and the environmental material, is more advanced than the hind legs (feet). Because the hind legs are specifically used for walking, they have slowly degenerated. In addition, the toes of the hind legs are shorter than those of the forelegs, so their active function is naturally worse than that of the forelegs.</p>
<h3>洗浴時的注意</h3>
<h3>Precautions When Bathing</h3>
<p>我們平常洗浴的水，温度應當在四十度内外，不可過于冷，也不可過于熱。普通有這温度，身上的黴菌，就能齣消滅了。所以當入浴的時候，先把全身浸熱水五分鐘，使身上的汚海與附着皮膚的黴菌，吸收熱水，那末再用絲爪經或粗布一擦，容易把身上的垢汚洗去。但是洗浴時，面部千萬不可洗，深恐身體上或浴缸裏的齷龊東西，傳染到限耳鼻口裏去。</p>
<p>The water we usually use for bathing should be around 40 degrees Celsius, not too cold or too hot. At this temperature, the mold on the body can be eliminated. Therefore, when entering the bath, first soak the whole body in hot water for five minutes, so that the dirt and mold attached to the skin absorb the hot water. Then, wipe with a silk sponge or coarse cloth to easily wash away the dirt from the body. However, do not wash the face during bathing, for fear that dirty things from the body or in the bathtub will infect the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.</p>

<p>The gold market has been volatile for days, making it difficult to predict. After rising the day before yesterday, it fell again yesterday. In the early morning, due to foreign cable reports of broad declines in London's spot and forward prices, the footing was poor. New York silver prices fell by half a cent, the British-American exchange rate rose by 0.75, and the American-British exchange rate rose by half a cent. All of this was still satisfactory, but because the decline in forward silver prices was minimal, only a slight 0.5, and the bank's private cables showed a slight decrease of 0.625, market sentiment was poor. Spot trading was done at $76-$77, but before long, news came from foreign cables that the United States was about to lift the ban on gold exports, and market sentiment stabilized. Therefore, the opening price was slightly higher than the previous close at $1080.05. At the initial opening of the foreign exchange market, the ups and downs were slight, and no attention was paid. Buyers were excited, but after rising to $1085, the foreign exchange market still did not show any improvement, and there were many who sold off. In addition, news suddenly came from foreign cables that US President Roosevelt had proposed buying silver, which was beneficial to silver prices. A selling trend arose at that time, and the price fell back to within $80. The foreign exchange market also eased. It was difficult to sell US$30.0625 for July delivery (the bank had first taken in US$30). Citibank even blocked US$29.5625 for May delivery, and the price fell to $72.50. At this point, Maccaglee began to take in US$30.1875 for July delivery. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announced that both British and American currencies had fallen by 0.125, and gradually pulled back up, but because those who were blocking sales were still strong, the price fell back again after reaching $6. There were frequent changes in the environment. Foreign cables stated that the President's proposal to raise silver prices was unlikely to pass. Buyers became slightly active. Maccaglee took in another US$0.125 for July delivery, and the market gradually improved to $77.50, but because US$29.3125 for April delivery was available, the price remained downstream. There were no buyers for US$30.1875 for July delivery, and the price was even lower. After the good news from foreign cables, bad news came. It was said that Pittman had again issued arguments in favor of the silver bill. The selling trend was frequent, and the Guangdong banks came to sell off, breaking the $70 mark and reaching $1069.50. Before long, the noon close was $1071.80, and the trend was very erratic. The premium for refined silver remained at $38. The spread for April-May hedging narrowed slightly, with the shorts posting $27.50. Now, the market situation for half a day is recorded below.</p>

<p>The opening price was $1080.50, a slight increase of $0.50 from the previous close. In spot trading, the initial price was called at $76-$77. Xie Xing Yong took the lead in buying, and although Bing Xing sold, the price still rose to $80. Yuan Cang Yong took in more, so the opening price was higher than the previous close, due to news from foreign cables that the United States had issued an order to lift the ban on gold exports. Heng Yu and Yi Feng Yong were the first to buy, and the market situation was excellent. The foreign exchange market opened flat, with the British exchange rate at one shilling eight pence three seven five, slightly tighter than the previous close of 0.0625, and the American exchange rate at $29.1875, slightly firmer at 0.0625. At this time, there were still no larger transactions. The price of gold continued to rise, with Yong Jin reaching $1085. Heng Yu sold off at the high price, and because the foreign exchange market was weak, a downstream trend was seen. Da De Cheng further sold to within $3, and Tian Feng Yong and Zhao Feng Chang sold to within $1, to $0.05. Mitsui was the first to sell US$30 for July delivery, returning more than $10. After this, a sharp decline was seen, and sellers in the market were brave. Although the banks took in, it was difficult to stop the decline. Yi Feng Yong sold to $80, and Zhi Feng Yong further came out at $79. Heng Yu came to sell again, and the price immediately fell to $75.20, due to news from foreign cables that US President Roosevelt was considering buying silver. Anda Na US$30.0625 for July delivery, Heng Xing and Yuan Chun both entered, and the price rose to $8. In a blink of an eye, it was difficult to sell US$0.0625 for July delivery. Yuan Kang Xiang and Qian Chang Xiang sold to within $6. Citibank blocked US$29.5625 for May delivery again. Qian Chang Xiang came to sell, and Zhao Feng Chang and Xie Xing Yong also sold at this time, and the price fell to $2.50. Maccaglee sold US$30.1875 for July delivery, Bing Xing came to enter, pulling the price to outside of $4. HSBC announced the exchange rates, with both shillings and US dollars shrinking by 0.125. Fu Yu entered to outside of $5. Mitsui took in another US$0.125 for July delivery, and the price rose to $6. After this, the situation was rather quiet. Qing Fa Yong and Heng Xing bought slightly, while Yuan Kang Xiang and Heng Yu sold, and the price hovered around $5. When Yuan Mao Yong entered the market to buy, Maccaglee sold US$0.125 for July delivery again, and the price rose to outside of $7. Rui Xing then sold, and the price continued to fall, but there was still a struggle. US$31.125 for April delivery was available, and Yuan Mao Yong sold again. Da Xing Yong also sold, but because Heng Xing took in slightly, the situation was still缓和. By the time US$30.1875 for July delivery was difficult to sell, Qian Chang Xiang and Yuan Mao sold vigorously, and the price fell to about $1. Zhong Fu bought US$30.1875 for July delivery, and Fu Chang bought, and the price was good to $1. However, the trend was still bad. Heng Yu sold to $3, and Heng Xing suddenly sold off, and the price fell continuously to within $2. Fu Chang and Fu Tai Heng both took in, and the price rose from $1 to about $1. But because Heng Xing's selling pressure was strong, they sold off again. Although Da Lian Gang Shun Li took in, the price still fell. Tong Yi then sold on behalf of them, and the price fell to about $70. Bing Xing and Yong Feng Fa took in, and they were still able to struggle. In a short time, Tong Yi sold again on behalf of Heng Xing, and the price could not be sustained, and then broke the $70 mark and fell to $1069.50, because it was difficult to sell US$0.25 for July delivery. At this time, Zhi Feng Yong also sold off, but because Da Xing Yong wanted to take in with a limited盤, they were able to support the price. Fu Chang entered to outside of $70, and Qian Chang Xiang further entered to $71. Maccaglee took in US$0.25 for the July exchange rate. Da De Cheng and Fu Chang came to buy again, and the price was added to $2.50. Before long, the noon close was $1071.80, and the items were raised by levy and auctioned at $73. The highest price in the half-day was $1085, the lowest price was $1069.50, with a rise and fall of $15.50. The market situation was still and special changes resulted in a fall of $8.20 from the previous close.</p>

<p>Under the Struggle Between Bulls and Bears</p>
<p>Public Bonds Fluctuate Inconsistently</p>
<p>Afternoon Northern Traders Increase Purchases at Rising Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange remained stable. Aside from spread trading between bulls and bears, there were few new transactions. Large investors were gradually balancing their positions, while there was still more activity among small retail investors. There were also new rumors circulating in the market about new diplomatic avenues, which were widely discussed, causing unease among short sellers. The morning sessions were quite chaotic, with bulls and bears competing fiercely, and prices fluctuated inconsistently, although the difference between the highs and lows was only ten to twenty fen. Nos. 31 and 44 bonds were mostly sold, while Nos. 20 and 21 bonds were mostly bought. After the afternoon opening, northern traders showed some demand, and small retail investors mostly bought in, leading to a uniform increase of twenty to thirty fen in market prices. The closing trend remained strong. The 20th bond remained high due to the slight decrease of bull spread trades on the 40th bond. The overall result for the day was a continued increase of one to five jiao, but the consolidated tax futures still fell by five fen. With only one trading day left in the month (the 27th), there may still be significant fluctuations. The total transaction volume was approximately 6.61 million yuan. No spot transactions were made throughout the day. The April futures contract was the most active, with the unified customs tax accounting for over 2.8 million in long positions, armament reduction contracts totaled 970,000, and the remaining contracts ranged from about 200,000 to over 600,000.</p>

<p>According to the report from Sun Fook On &amp; Co., the New York stock market on Friday (the 24th) was even more stagnant, with a total trading volume of only 640,000 shares. Due to a reduction in dividends by a subsidiary of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, speculators generally expected that its dividends would also be reduced, causing the price to sink to a new low for the year. Other stocks also weakened due to concerns about the German situation, and German public bonds plummeted by one to seven yuan. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>

<h3>美棉救濟案難望照案通過</h3>
<p>US Cotton Relief Bill Unlikely to Pass as Originally Proposed</p>
<p>A report from New York on the 24th regarding the cotton market for the week stated that the cotton market had turned reactive due to the liquidation of long positions, and sentiment was quite unsettled. There was no certainty regarding the farm relief bill. Although the bill passed the House of Representatives, it was feared that it would be cut back in the Senate. Southern sales were minimal, and price declines were limited due to industry buying and short covering. However, demand was also limited. There were reports of delays in cotton cultivation in the Middle East, but better progress was being made in the Atlantic states and the Southwest. Therefore, concrete opinions on cotton fields were not readily available, as they depended on the development of farm relief and acreage restrictions, as well as loans for agricultural crops. The passage of the farm relief bill in the House of Representatives was not surprising, but it was expected to face setbacks in the Senate, where there was a strong desire to amend it. Therefore, some experts believed that the plan of Mr. Miss, [incomplete text]. The weekend statistics are listed on the left (in thousands of bales):</p>

<h3>糧食河下米續小一二角</h3>
<p>Grains: "River-Down" Rice Continues to Fall by One or Two Jiao</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's arrivals exceeded fifty vessels. Urban and rural merchants remained sluggish, with only six to seven hundred shi sold. As a result, market conditions softened, and the prices of Suzhou-Tongxiang and Qingjiao Nanxiang rice fell by one or two jiao. Judging from the overall situation, there is no significant demand, and the inland rice supply is congested. It is anticipated that prices may fall further within the next few days. Du Yang Jian and Yin Yuan remained stagnant and were slightly discounted. Bian Yuan lacked supply, and sales were still available, so prices were expected to stabilize.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 26 to 27 vessels arrived from the "River-Down" region. Bai Geng retail prices decreased, and the market fell by one or two jiao. Thin rice arrivals were frequent, but retail sales were slow. Tianjin rice transactions were six to seven hundred shi, with prices slightly lower. Early rice was also slightly lower. Hua Du Jian and Bai Ke Jian were also slightly discounted. Machine Ke Jian Bai Yuan was slightly lower by several fen. Yin Yuan fell by two to three jiao.</p>
<h3>客秈狂落三四角</h3>
<p>Ke Hsien Rice Plummets Wildly by Thirty to Forty Jiao</p>
<p>存到兩多……去化呆滯</p>
<p>Excessive Inventory...Sluggish Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Hsien rice market suddenly plummeted. Machine-milled and unpolished rice prices fell uniformly. Initially, there was a continuous flow of arrivals, with large shipments en route, while inventory remained abundant and sales were weak. Local merchants were unwilling to inquire due to the recent drop in "River-Down" rice prices. The Fujianese were also unenthusiastic. In addition, sentiment was weak, and sellers were eager to sell. Hunan unpolished rice prices fell by thirty to forty jiao, machine-milled red rice fell slightly by half a jiao, and early rice continued to fall by one jiao. After the market softened, local merchants began to inquire. The Tong market was dominated by Fujianese merchants purchasing 140 bags of Hunan Hong rice at 7.5 yuan, and 100 bags of unpolished red rice at 7.45 yuan. Local merchants purchased 80 bags of Yunnan Hunan machine-milled red rice at 8.3 yuan, and 100 bags of Jiangxi early rice at 6.5 yuan.</p>
<p>廠方不限價抛出</p>
<h3>標粉跌勢甚猛</h3>
<p>Flour Plummets Sharply As Mills Dump Unrestricted</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market did not show any significant fluctuations after the morning opening. As both Zihgam and Chicago wheat quotations fluctuated in different directions by about a dime, market participants remained composed. However, the flour market became increasingly sluggish and weak during the following trading sessions due to the continuous dumping of flour from Foo Foong, whose sales volume was quite large. Moreover, some merchants from Ke Pang continued dumping, the flour market became extremely bearish. The afternoon trading session saw a large collapse, as mills dumped remaining products irrespective of market prices. Consequently, the lock up which lasted for a half-month came to a conclusion. Amid heavy selling pressure, flour prices plummeted, and it was rumored that Niu Sze &amp; Co. contracted to import 3,000 tons of wheat at a price as low as 3.324 yuan per ton. This rumor made the market participants very nervous, and caused prices to fall. The prices for May, June and July contracts declined to as low as 1.705 yuan. The price levels were close to the historical low. The market will become unimaginable if imported wheat price goes lower. As a result, the current month contract fell by two fen compared with yesterday, while the prices for April to July contracts each fell by three fen, and the August contract fell by three and a half fen.</p>
<h3>期麥受粉市牽掣</h3>
<p>Wheat Futures Affected by Plunging Flour Market</p>
<p>忍痛出檔……小去二三分</p>
<p>Reluctantly Cutting Losses...Slight Losses of Two to Three Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market saw little price movement in the morning session, the sentiment was still negative because very few buyers showed up and the selling of flour was smooth. As a result, the price of wheat fell. Afternoon trading also experienced a collapse. It was difficult for the market to support the price as the price of flour plunged. Finally, because the dealers were ordering wheat continuously, the risk in keeping the stocks was too high, so most of them chose to cut their losses. The prices for futures contracts dropped steadily. As a result, the current month contract fell by two fen compared with yesterday, the April contract fell by three fen. The prices for May and June contracts had no price comparison, the July contract fell by four fen, and the August contract fell by seven fen.</p>
<h3>杜沙荳存厚不振</h3>

<p>赤豆高貨板價甚力</p>
<p>Red Bean, High-Quality Goods See Strong Resistance</p>
<p>Mung beans and yellow soybeans showed decent sales volumes and are priced handsomely, but they suffered from market slumps due to large inventories. The high-quality goods from both Guangxia and the gangs there were being shipped to Little Luzon, thus, the price was stable. The incoming yellow beans are being accepted but some merchants are accepting the cheaper product which makes the market unstable. High quality red beans are dry, and the inventories are still quite high, however, owners of this type of high grade product are resisting prices so trade is scarce. Yesterday, a cargo arrived from Pinghu with 53 packages, with the commodities in question that cannot be kept on shelves for too long and sold immediately, was priced at three taels and eight qian by foreign merchants.</p>

<p>Silk, Tea, and Native Products Market: Needle-like and Eyebrow Teas Active in French Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, native product needle-like and eyebrow green teas were in demand from French merchants who requested them in cables. Zhenmei's market became relatively active. The entire city's purchases from Jardine Matheson, Jinlong, Yongxing, and Qi Mo and other shops accounted for 282 boxes. Road Zhenmei was priced at seventy-eight taels, Native Zhenmei was sold at 40-50 taels, and Native Needle-Like was sold at 20-30 taels. All prices remained the same. Qimen black tea inventory remained at 2000+ boxes and Chinese merchants were compelled to sell the commodities at that price to realize capital. Yesterday, English merchants broadcast cables.</p>

<p>After the China Tobacco Company purchased many zinc sheets, the market supply for these zinc sheets remained short. Even with recent purchases from the Tea merchants, market supply is very short. Each "dan" would sell up to 29 taels, higher than before. Arrival takes time.</p>

<p>Due to the Enamel factory producing Summer products, the people from the factory are collecting black iron sheets.

Sheets 8-9 sell at 8 taels 7 qian. Sheets with 10 sell for 9 taels. Sheets over 11 are at 9 and a half taels, and sheets with 18 are sold at 9 taels. There were 2000 dans that were transacted yesterday.</p>

<p>Flannel is currently selling well. Such as Bean Paste, Yellow Brown, Green Grey, White Grey, Light Grey, Red Striped. Tailoring shops on Sima Road show large demand and are capable of purchasing around 3.20 to 3.5. This is because winter clothes continue to be popular and so merchants are competing to buy. The running agents all rush to show samples to secure purchases first.</p>

<h3>出賣靈魂的秘訣</h3>
<p>The Secret to Selling One's Soul</p>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>— By He Jiagan</p>
<p>幾年前，胡適博士曾經玩過一套。五鬼閙中華，的把戲，那是說：這世界上並無所謂帝國主義之類在侵略中國，倒是中國自己該着「貧窮」，「愚昧」…等五個鬼，鬧得大家不安寗。現在，胡適博士又發見了第六個鬼！呌做仇恨。這個鬼不但閙中華，而且禍延友邦，鬧到東京去了。因此，胡博士對症發藥，預備向「日本朋友」上條陳。</p>
<p>A few years ago, Dr. Hu Shih played a trick called "Five Ghosts Haunting China," which claimed that there was no such thing as imperialism invading China. Instead, China was plagued by five ghosts: "poverty," "ignorance," etc., causing unrest among the people. Now, Dr. Hu Shih has discovered a sixth ghost! It's called hatred. This ghost not only haunts China but also harms friendly nations, causing trouble in Tokyo. Therefore, Dr. Hu is prescribing a remedy, preparing to make recommendations to his "Japanese friends."</p>
<p>據博士說：「日本軍閥在中國暴行所造成之仇恨，到今日已頗難消除」，「而日本决不能用暴力征服中國」，（見報載胡適之最近談話，下同）。道是值得憂慮的：難道眞的没有方法征服中國嗎？不，法子是有的。「九世之仇，百年之友，均在覺悟不覺悟之關頭上，」！「日本只有一個方法可以征服中國，卽懸崖勒馬，澈底停止侵略中國，反過來征服中國民族的心。</p>
<p>According to the doctor, "The hatred caused by the atrocities of Japanese warlords in China is difficult to eliminate today," and "Japan can never conquer China by force." (See recent remarks by Hu Shih as reported in the newspapers, same below). This is a matter of concern: Is there really no way to conquer China? No, there is a way. "Enmity of nine generations and friendship of a hundred years depend on whether one is enlightened or not!" "Japan has only one way to conquer China: to rein in its horses at the precipice, completely stop invading China, and instead conquer the hearts of the Chinese people."</p>
<p>這據說是「征服中國的唯一方法。」不錯，古代的儒敎軍師，，總說「以德服人者王，其心誠服也」。胡適博士不愧爲日本帝國主義的軍師。但是，從中國小百姓方面說來，這却是出賣靈魂的唯一秘訣。中國小百姓實在「愚昧」，原不懂得自己的民族性」，所以他們一向會仇恨。如果日本陛下大發慈悲，居然採用胡博士的條陳，那末，所謂「忠孝仁愛信義和平」的中國固有文化，就可以恢復：！因爲日本不用暴力而用軟功的王道，中國民族就不至於再生仇恨，因爲没有仇恨，自然更不抵抗，因爲更不抵抗，自然就更和平，更忠孝……中國的肉體固然買到了，中國的靈魂也被征服了。</p>
<p>This is said to be "the only way to conquer China." Indeed, ancient Confucian military strategists always said, "He who conquers with virtue reigns, and his heart is truly conquered." Dr. Hu Shih is indeed a military strategist for Japanese imperialism. However, from the perspective of ordinary Chinese people, this is the only secret to selling one's soul. Ordinary Chinese people are indeed "ignorant" and do not understand their own national character," so they have always harbored hatred. If His Majesty the Emperor of Japan, in his great mercy, were to adopt Dr. Hu's recommendations, then the inherent Chinese culture of "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace" could be restored! Because Japan would not use violence but instead use the gentle power of the kingly way, the Chinese people would not generate hatred again. Because there would be no hatred, they would naturally not resist. Because they would not resist, there would naturally be more peace and more loyalty and filial piety... China's body would indeed be bought, and China's soul would also be conquered.</p>
<p>可惜的是這「唯一方法」的實行，完全要　日本陛下的覺悟。如果不覺悟，那又怎麽辦？胡博士回答道：「到無可奈何之時，眞的接受一種恥辱的城下之盟」好了。那眞是無可奈何的呵丨因爲那時候「仇恨鬼」是不肯走的，這始終是中國民族性的汚點，卽爲日本計，也非萬全之道。</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the implementation of this "only method" completely depends on the enlightenment of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan. If he is not enlightened, then what can be done? Dr. Hu replied, "When there is no other option, we must truly accept a humiliating treaty of surrender." That would truly be helpless! Because at that time, the "ghost of hatred" would not leave, and this would always be a stain on the Chinese national character. Even for Japan's sake, it is not a perfect solution.</p>
<p>因此，胡博士準備出席太平洋會議，再去「忠告」一次他的日本朋友：征服中國並不是没有法子的，請接受我們出賣的靈魂罷，何况這並不難，所謂澈底停止侵略」，原只要執行「公平的」李頓報告，丨仇恨自然就銷除了！</p>
<p>Therefore, Dr. Hu is preparing to attend the Pacific Conference to give his Japanese friends another "sincere piece of advice": There is indeed a way to conquer China. Please accept our souls that we are selling. Moreover, it is not difficult. The so-called "completely stopping aggression" only requires implementing the "fair" Lytton Report, and hatred will naturally be eliminated!</p>
<h3>North Sichuan Road</h3>
<p>— Ma Guoliang</p>
<p>New Year's red lanterns, Bank of China, Tang Bailin, large white dishes, cars, people in red and green, fish congee and minced pork noodles, Moon Palace Dance Hall, Hengchang Tailor Shop, renovated in 1933, the most reasonable prices, Xinya Tea Room, Shanghai Grand Theatre, Secrets of the English Court… one of the world's top ten films…</p>
<p>The upper section of North Sichuan Road is still so lively, a chaotic mass of people fills the street. But just past the Shanghai Grand Theatre, it becomes so quiet and dark, as if the people and cars above… once they get here, they're like ghosts who've covered their eyes, everyone turns their heads and no longer runs downwards; suddenly, the bottom becomes so calm.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my eyes haven't been covered by ghosts, I can still see the road ahead, so I keep running into the darkness.</p>
<p>Two or three empty rickshaws are slowly pulled along sluggishly. Under the dim light, as if recognizing someone walking, the empty vehicles desperately rush forward as if in a race, the oiled canvas hoods making flapping sounds.</p>
<p>To the right of the standard clock, on the wasteland that was leveled by the January 28th artillery fire, several young children are squatting amidst the rubble. They’ve probably just finished selling the evening newspapers and are putting on a practiced, adult-like appearance as they smoke and argue about something…</p>
<p>How strange! My heart skipped a beat! Aren’t these the children from the movie "A Way to Live" turned into real living people, jumping out of the screen! But then I mocked my own foolishness, the children in "A Way to Live" had already run to the factory and completed a section of railway! Only our children have the fortune to run around randomly, with no one caring or paying attention, smoking if they want to smoke!</p>
<p>The wonton seller walks around at the entrance of Dade Lane, hitting the bamboo clapper in his hand, shouting, "Wonton noodles!" Stretching his neck, he looks up at the people living upstairs. But the upper floors are dark and silent. Nothing can be conjured out of thin air. There's still no movement from above. Pshaw! The wonton seller blows his nose, "Wonton noodles!" The bamboo clapper clatters, the sound vibrating in the quiet street center, making people shiver!</p>
<p>Three Japanese soldiers, thoroughly imitating the drunken steps of Americans, stagger and stumble from behind, brushing past me. Passing the entrance of a small eatery, one of them pushes over the wooden sign placed at the doorway, and then they brag and walk on. This is the so-called spirit of Bushido of the Yamato race, I thought.</p>
<p>The heavy footsteps gradually disappear ahead of me, and Baoxing Road is left behind. The mud in the pool under Yokohama Bridge reflects the desolate moonlight above. It's even colder and lonelier. People are all asleep, aren't they? Yes, they've been fast asleep for a long time. But there will always be a tomorrow when they wake up, a day when they finally jump up.</p>
<p>The tall building of the Japanese Elementary School, like an arrogant giant, stands coldly by the roadside. The roar of January 28th didn't shatter it, but in the future, it won't be able to escape an even greater roar, I thought, as my legs continued to move forward. It's even quieter now! Like a tomb—it really is a tomb! On the morning of the second day of January 28th, I crawled out of this tomb, passing through many bloody bayonets, escaping with my life!</p>
<p>Walking further down, I felt even more isolated. Suddenly recalling the splendor of the upper section of North Sichuan Road, I couldn’t quite believe my eyes just now. I immediately turned around and ran back, running to the entrance of the Shanghai Grand Theatre in one breath. Instantly, everything brightened up, and the people and cars were still such a chaotic mess, New Year's red lanterns, people in red and green... Tang Bailin...</p>
<p>I turned my head again and ran back, and in front of me was still such a desolate scene, and darkness! Believe it or not, anyway, I haven't grown another pair of eyes on my head.</p>
<p>Over there is money, extravagance, laughter, pleasure, pleasure, and more pleasure; here is a scene of desolation, a scene of darkness, mixed with painful sighs. Look, friend, never mind anything else, just one North Sichuan Road has two worlds!</p>
<p>The laughter over there doesn't reach here, and the sighs here can't be heard over there either.</p>
<p>Wait and see, I thought. No longer having the strength to walk out, I turned into my apartment hidden in the darkness.</p>
<p>Terrifying darkness! I leaned my head out of the window and looked around, sticking out my tongue. But when I jumped into bed, I immediately comforted myself:</p>
<p>People living next to a volcano won't be there forever; when the sun comes out tomorrow, it will light up here too!</p>
<h3>Elegant Person</h3>
<p>— Zhang Tianyi</p>
<p>It is said that people are divided into elegant and vulgar, and that everything has old and new distinctions, so there are old elegant people and new elegant people. Old elegant people recite five-character and seven-character lines about wind, flowers, snow, and moon, play the seven-stringed zither, frolic with women, play with antique calligraphy and paintings, or even smoke opium, and so on. New elegant people, on the other hand, exert effort on nightingales and roses, write lines of poetry, paint oil paintings, play the Western pipa, lie on their "lover's" lap and practice their singing voice, or take a nap like that, and so on. There are many varieties, too numerous to record.</p>
<p>Although the styles of new and old elegant people are different, the conditions for being elegant are the same. Elegant people must be scholars, knowing more than ordinary people. If you don’t have money to pay for tuition and uniform fees (in many schools, students who don’t pay for uniforms are expelled), you can forget about becoming an elegant person. Secondly, they must be detached from the mundane world. It is said that elegant people "do not engage in production," and don't care about the bustling and troublesome affairs of the world, and despise discussing fiery political matters.</p>
<p>However, it is truly strange: the vulgar things that elegant people do are much more sophisticated than those of vulgar people. Our ancient elegant people all mixed well with high officials and nobles. Even the immortal who was so elegant that he seemed to have no earthly desires had to fawn over the wealthy and serve as a "court attendant" in the palace, amusing the emperor. As for someone like Mr. Tao, who didn't care for five pecks of rice and "returned," he was an exception, but that was because he had "fields" to "return" to.</p>
<p>This is talking about the old elegant people.</p>
<p>As for the new elegant people, apart from a few new-style "court attendants," the rest are all "born at an unfortunate time": they have no "soulmates." Because there are too many "new figures" now. No one appreciates them. Then "return," but the countryside is plagued by natural disasters and human calamities year after year, and there are no "fields" to "return" to. And what's worse, imperialism is constantly bombing us with cannons and dropping bombs, and everyone is about to fight them to the death. This is a vulgar matter, but it is a matter of life and death. If you are not careful, even your elegant life is hard to guarantee.</p>
<p>So what to do? There are a few paths:</p>
<p>One, be elegant in a way that is half old and half new, in order to find "soulmates."</p>
<p>Two, just sigh and do nothing else.</p>
<p>Three, come up with a new theory of national salvation. Because staying in an ivory tower and making art more sophisticated can also bring glory to the country.</p>
<p>Except for the second option, which is slightly passive, the other two are both maintaining the identity of an elegant person and being practical, which is very appropriate.</p>
<h3>Random Words from Qu Lu</h3>
<p>— Zi Zhan</p>
<p>(Ten) (One) Essay Formula</p>
<p>Recently, I saw an article by Mr. Yu Dafu in the "Free Talk" section about the essay formula, which reminded me of an interesting incident when I first took up the teaching post seventeen years ago. I once said that scholars today have nothing to do, so they descend to teach, and if they have no expertise in teaching, they descend to teach Chinese literature. If we borrow the constant saying of my old friend Mr. Li Wu, the so-called mentally challenged, Chinese literature teachers belong to this group, without a doubt, and I am one of them. When I was young, I dabbled in writing and was ranked alongside teachers and Confucian scholars, holding a book and stepping onto the podium, feeling invincible. However, I was the youngest, and my colleagues often looked down on me because of this. After I read the students' papers twice, I discovered an essay formula used by the whole class:</p>
<p>"Living in the world… why? Because… from this perspective… wouldn't it be… ah… alas…"</p>
<p>Let's take the so-called revolution of today as the topic and apply the formula:</p>
<p>"Living in the world, one must engage in revolution, why? Because if a person engages in revolution, in a small way, it is easy to find a job and eat, and in a big way, it is not difficult to be promoted and become wealthy. But the so-called revolution today is a matter of moderation; not leaning to one side is called moderation, and not being extreme is called gentleness. Moderation is the highest virtue! Therefore, being too revolutionary is degeneration, inevitably leading to murder and arson. Being too unrevolutionary is corruption, inevitably leading to senility and incompetence. Achieving the middle ground is revolution; once one is revolutionary, one is a comrade; if a comrade is most loyal, one can become a great person. From this perspective, of all the people today, none are better than revolutionaries. If one wants to make one's revolution great, how can one not first be loyal to one's so-called loyalty? Alas, this is why there are more and more loyal comrades, and why the revolution is successful."</p>
<p>In short, any topic can be put into this formula. At that time, I jokingly made a banner and a couplet and posted them on the door:</p>
<p>Alas</p>
<p>Living in the world why because</p>
<p>From this perspective wouldn't it be ah</p>
<p>And I warned the students: anyone who commits these sixteen characters in their essays will be penalized by having to rewrite them, and those who commit them again must slap their own palms. The whole school was in an uproar, and I almost left to avoid the situation. Finally, two or three old classmates interceded for me, and I was spared being ostracized. But in the end, the students warned each other not to use this essay formula again.</p>
<p>Long Fiction</p>
<h3>The Crossroads of the Times and Love</h3>
<p>— Zhang Guanping</p>
<p>"But that is impossible. It insults women, and it is also a sign of..."</p>
<p>He decided to leave. Because Madam Cao's demonstration was really too intense. He wanted to get up several times, but he felt that his legs below were just limp and couldn't stand up. He still stole another hungry glance at Madam Cao's pinkish-white chest.</p>
<p>He knew that he was standing at a crossroads. He couldn't give up the nobility and purity like Peizhu. But at the same time, he felt that the only way to cure his current feelings of loneliness was to seek some unthinkable comfort from women like Madam Hezi.</p>
<p>"What do you have to say to Shiguang? ...I know, you're all no good! You two must have made a secret agreement beforehand, and now you're trying to drag me along! Mr. Lin, Acao already likes playing that game enough, and you're trying to drag him out to play again, I really can't agree to it! ...Men and women are equal! If a man can leave his wife and find another mistress outside, then a wife can also move freely! Mr. Lin, do you think that's right?"</p>
<p>Madam Cao's words were like a wave that hadn't settled down, and then a surprising peak rose again. So he couldn't help but argue with her for a while. When the argument couldn't be resolved, he suddenly heard a sound on the stairs, a series of thumping sounds.</p>
<p>"Old Lin, you're here? What kind of wind blew you here?"</p>
<p>They had another long argument about the issue of gender equality, and before they knew it, it was past one o'clock. Because Haiquan helped Cao Shiguang and Madam Cao argue, she said she would punish him by making him treat them to dinner. Haiquan naturally agreed. Hearing Haiquan agree to her request, she was as happy as a child again, hurrying to apply makeup and change clothes.</p>
<p>Twenty-nine</p>
<p>Qiuying was very happy when she heard that Haiquan had asked Shiguang to find a garret, wanting to move over and live in the same alley with them.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, wait a few more days. The garret there is about to become available. Isn't the New Year's holiday coming soon? The student living in the garret is going home, and he has already returned the room to the second landlord. The second landlord has also asked me to introduce someone familiar to him. It's only seven dollars, including electricity, incredibly cheap."</p>

<p>Premier of the Executive Yuan Issue to be Resolved Soon</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang arrived in Kaifeng by plane from Baoding at 10:00 AM on the 25th. At 6:30 PM, he traveled south from Kaifeng by special train, accompanied by his attendant secretary, Deng Wenyi, and several others. He arrived in Pukou at 10:00 AM on the 26th.

<p>(Nanjing) Two flower-decorated cars carrying Premier Wang, Sun Ke, Chen Bijun, and Tang Youren arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai at 7:30 AM on the 26th. Zeng Zhongming welcomed them. Wang told reporters that after returning to Nanjing, he would immediately meet with Chairman Chiang to discuss national affairs. Later, he received a telegram from Chiang, stating that he would return to Nanjing two or three days later. Therefore, he took the opportunity to go to Shanghai to urge Song Zhen to handle affairs at the Executive Yuan. Song firmly declined due to the heavy financial burden. He specially returned to Nanjing to consult with the Central government on the selection of a successor. In short, this matter will definitely not be delayed any further, and it should be resolved in a day or two. His illness has now slightly improved, but according to doctors, it may recur at any time within a year. After leaving the station, Wang and Chen took a car to the official residence of the Ministry of Railways, and Sun returned to the official residence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Sun Ke invited Dai Fuxian, Ye Chu, etc., to meet with Wang at his residence at 10:00 AM for discussions. (Central News dispatch, morning of the 26th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) This morning, Shen Honglie, Fang Juehui, and Ge Guangting arrived in Jinan from Qingdao. Shen said that his previous resignation was due to his lack of personal talent and ability. Upon the consolation of Chiang, He, and Han, he reluctantly agreed to continue and work with Han to maintain public order in Shandong. Qingdao City is now striving to improve the people's livelihood. Last year, it built 400,000 meters of rural roads, which is equivalent to what was built in the more than 20 years of German and Japanese administration. The education budget was originally 480,000 yuan per year, and it was increased by 240,000 yuan last year. Fang said that Shen's intention to resign has been withdrawn, and he has reported this to Chiang and He. There are currently a total of eleven Japanese warships in North China, including the original three destroyers, and four more have been added. Three of them are stationed in Dagu. The Tama and Iwate cruisers are now in Qingdao. Their commander, Tsuda, arrived in Qingdao today on the flagship Hirato.

<p>(Beiping) Since the enemy increased its troops in the Gubeikou area, it has been shelling our positions from time to time and has repeatedly used small units to harass us, but they have been repeatedly repelled by our army. According to the people who fled back from the enemy area, the Japanese army has been severely beaten by our army and is quite fearful.

<h3>Shao Yuan-chong Receives Foreign Correspondents</h3>
<p>Reporting on Our Country's Unified Determination to Resist Japan</p>
<p>Striving for National Survival with a Spirit of Fearlessness</p>
<p>Hoping Friendly Nations Understand and Provide Moral Support in Friendship</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shao Yuan-chong hosted foreign journalists at the German Hotel on the 25th and delivered the following speech: Gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to meet with you all today. You have all been engaged in journalism in China for many years and have provided much support for Chinese friendship. You are all good friends of China. China is currently in an unfortunate situation. The Chinese people are willing to exert their own efforts to overcome this national crisis, and they hope that you will provide moral assistance to convey the truth of the Chinese Kuomintang's struggle to all countries of the world, so that they will not be blinded by biased news. This would be of great help to China. Since the founding of the Republic of China, progress has often been hindered by unexpected obstacles, so that political construction, economic construction, and cultural construction have not yet achieved the expected results. However, we must not be disappointed because China, with its land, population, and history, cannot easily completely reform old habits and create a new foundation in a short period of time. Ten or twenty years is a very short time in history, so we must not be disappointed by the failure to completely succeed in reform. We must only work harder to achieve construction success, and we firmly believe that continuous efforts and a determination to persevere will enable us to achieve final success and create a glorious new life for the Chinese nation and state. The reasons for the obstacles to China's past construction progress are numerous, but the biggest reason is the instigation, destruction, aggression, and oppression of Japanese imperialism. Therefore, since the Qing Dynasty and the Yuan Shikai era, all movements for innovation and efforts to build the country by the Chinese people have been constantly subjected to direct or indirect oppression and destruction by Japanese imperialism, either by supporting old forces to suppress new forces, or by using anti-democratic forces to confront democratic forces. This historical fact of the past few decades can be illustrated by any example. Since the Meiji era, the only national strategy of Japanese imperialism has been to annex the Asian continent, threaten the world, and create the world's sole military power. China's natural resources are inexhaustible. After annexing Korea as the first step, Japan proceeded to annex China's Northeast, and then to annex the whole of China. With its barbaric military force and China's infinite resources, it would have no fear of being an enemy to all the powerful countries in the world. Therefore, the frequent and blatant serious oppression of China by Japanese imperialism in recent years is actually a challenge to the whole world, and China is the first to be sacrificed. However, the Chinese nation has never failed to encounter serious foreign insults in its more than four thousand years of history. However, the Chinese nation, with its perseverance and continuous efforts, has eventually been able to drive out foreign races or assimilate them. It will never be oppressed by foreign races for long. The Chinese nation is inherently peaceful, but within peace, it has a strong spirit, that is, to be able to save itself, love its national history, and worship heroes who sacrifice for the nation. For example, Yue Fei, who struggled throughout his life to defend his country, is consistently worshiped by the Chinese, old and young, as a national hero. His spirit is deeply rooted in the psychology of the general public. This is the inner expression of the Chinese national spirit. Therefore, no matter what the era, the Chinese nation has been able to resist foreign enemies, which is the expression of this national spirit. This national spirit is what sustains the life of the Chinese nation in the past, present, and future. Although the Chinese nation is now under serious oppression by Japanese imperialism, we firmly believe that our persevering struggle will be able to break through the serious environment with our own efforts and the encouragement of international justice, and give a powerful lesson to the violent invaders, so that they will suffer their own evil retribution. We are fighting with a spirit of fearlessness, so even if our material equipment is not as good as others, we can still use ancient weapons, such as broadswords, to fight against modern aircraft and cannons. We can make the entire nation sacrifice to resist oppressive forces, but we cannot allow ourselves to be subdued by unreasonable oppression. There is an ancient Chinese saying, "Better to be a shattered jade than a whole tile." This is what we use to encourage ourselves. This is what we use to encourage our struggle. John Hay of the United States said, "The center of the world's future problems is in the Pacific, and the center of the Pacific problems is in China." Sun Yat-sen also said, "China's peace is the foundation of world peace, and the success of the Chinese revolution is the guarantee of world peace." Therefore, the problem of China is actually the problem of the world, and the oppression and aggression of China by any power is a crisis for world peace. Therefore, the struggle of the Chinese nation is not only for the survival of its own nation, but also for the protection of world peace. The Chinese nation can cooperate in friendship with all nations of the world, and the Chinese state can cooperate in friendship with all countries of the world. China is happy to work together with the international community on all economic and cultural undertakings that can increase the common interests and development of China and the world, and to complete them together in accordance with Sun Yat-sen's principles of economic construction. However, if anyone wants to use military aggression and oppression to separate China's land and people and infringe upon China's sovereignty, then the Chinese people will continue to develop their spirit of resistance and fight for their nation and sovereignty. Because the Chinese nation is fighting for the nation, even if there is only one person left, he will fight to his last breath. This is the unanimous determination of China at this time, and it is also the common policy of the Chinese government and people today, which cannot be changed, nor can anyone change it. I am very happy to be able to meet with you all today, and I hope to have opportunities to shake hands in the future. I would like to express the general opinion of the Chinese people in a brief speech, and I hope that you will spread this opinion to the general public of friendly countries, so that they can understand the direction of the Chinese people's efforts and provide moral support in friendship. I would also like to ask you all to raise a glass and wish you good health. (Central News Agency dispatch, morning of the 26th)</p>
<h3>Li Liejun Arrives in Nanjing Today</h3>
<p>| Issues Statement |</p>
<p>Chiang, Feng, and Yan Share Anti-Japanese Determination</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Liejun arrived in Nanjing at 8:00 AM on the 26th. After staying for two or three days, he will go to Shanghai to attend an important central meeting on the 27th, and will also make suggestions. Li issued the following statement:</p>
<p>"Previously, due to the invasion of Rehe, I went north to inspect, hoping that the comrades in the north would quickly unite and protect this northern border. Unexpectedly, due to political shortcomings and unstable public sentiment, the enemy was given an opportunity. Although all parties made joint efforts, it was still a cause for regret. Since General Chiang went north to rectify the war situation, the arrangements have become more rigorous, and the front will have other measures. What I am paying attention to is also political reform. I believe that uniting the wisdom and courage of the people of the whole country is the fundamental problem to solve the national crisis. In the past, I have repeatedly discussed this with General Chiang in detail, and he very much agreed. Therefore, I have returned to Nanjing to make further plans. If the fundamental plan can be decided early, the whole country will be excited. It is said that although the Japanese are strong, they can eventually be broken. National affairs cannot be calculated by the day, but there is more than enough time for a month. The key is that people have the determination to fight, and scholars have long-term plans. In the past, the King of Yue was able to defeat Wu after ten years, even after the destruction of his country. Moreover, today is only a slight setback, and it can still be saved. In response to a reporter's question, he said, Feng lives a civilian life in Zhangjiakou and studies very diligently. His determination to resist Japan is very firm. He once said to me that he has four pistols. You and I each hold two and can fight the enemy. Moreover, hundreds of Hu guards can be used. Therefore, if the central government has any orders, he will be happy to obey and go to the front line to kill the enemy. The central government's politics are the responsibility of the central leadership. It is useless for Feng to come to Nanjing. I only hope to be able to serve on the battlefield. Yan Xishan's determination to resist Japan is the same as Feng's. Han Fuju has 100,000 troops and absolutely obeys the central government and awaits orders. Chiang's attitude is very clear and can be summarized in two sentences: 'His determination to resist Japan is more determined, and his attitude towards politics has changed greatly.'"

<p>Bandits on the Henan-Hubei Border</p>
<h3>Have Been Surrounded and Suppressed and Have Fled in Different Directions</h3>
<p>Troops are in Pursuit</p>
<p>(Hankou) Military news: The bandits Xiao Gu, Zhang Ma, and others, who were entrenched in the area between Tanghe, Tongbai, Biyang, Suixian, and Zaoyang on the border of Henan and Hubei, previously fled to Zhengyang, Queshan, and Xixian after being pursued and suppressed by the Luo Brigade stationed in Sui. They were then surrounded and suppressed on several sides by the Liu Fengqi Brigade, the Wu Tinglin Brigade of the Eleventh Route Army, the Fan Longzhang Brigade of the Twentieth Route Army, and the Henan security forces. After suffering heavy losses, a small group fled east of the railway and was tracked and suppressed by Zhang Fang, who was responsible. It is reported that they have been defeated. A large group that fled to western Henan was personally led by Liu Zhenhua to Jiaxian, Yuxian, Xuchang, Luoyang, and other counties to command his troops and security forces to pursue and suppress them in different directions. It is reported that many bandits have been killed in recent days. The remaining three hundred or so people were surrounded and suppressed by the Wu Brigade in Shiwo Slope and have fled in all directions. In this battle, more than one hundred bandits were killed and one hundred and eighty were captured alive. There is still a small group entrenched in Ducun, and troops are being sent to surround and suppress them. They can be wiped out completely within a few days.

<p>Reuters, New York, 25th: Wall Street now expects the United States to use gold bars as the basis. All gold coins and gold certificates will be recalled and will never be circulated. It is widely believed that gold can only be purchased in the form of gold bars, each priced at $8,000. It is also said that gold bar transactions will be limited to legitimate commercial needs as prescribed by the Treasury Department.</p>
<p>French Cabinet Discusses</p>
<h3>Four-Power Cooperation Plan</h3>
<p>Temporarily Does Not Decide on Attitude</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 25th: The French Cabinet today discussed the four-power understanding plan drafted by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for France, Britain, Germany, and Italy. It lasted a long time. According to a semi-official communiqué, the Cabinet will not make a decision for the time being, but will wait to ascertain the attitudes of the governments concerned, especially those that have not been consulted before, and then decide how to proceed. The Cabinet also discussed the overdue payment of war debts to the United States.</p>
<p>The Little Entente</p>
<h3>Is a Force Not to Be Scorned</h3>
<p>Communiqué Issued After Opening of Regular Meeting in Geneva</p>
<p>Opposes Any Agreement That Impedes Peace</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 25th: The Standing Committee of the Little Entente countries met in Geneva today and issued a communiqué stating, "The Standing Committee of the Little Entente countries, after carefully considering recent international events, believes that it is appropriate for countries to aspire to establish relations with each other and to resolve issues related to specific countries through cooperation. This cooperation can produce good results. However, if countries sign various treaties that force the signatory countries to take concrete decisions, or only allow the signatory countries to exert pressure on countries outside the treaty to achieve their goal of disposing of the rights of third countries, such means cannot be recognized by the Little Entente countries as conducive to good relations between countries. From a legal point of view, the property of others cannot be disposed of, directly or indirectly. Therefore, the Little Entente countries specifically reserve their rights regarding the desire of countries to conclude such treaties that infringe upon the rights and politics of the Little Entente countries. Such treaties have become a thing of the past and cannot exist after the establishment of the League of Nations. Moreover, there have been signs of proposals to amend treaties in recent negotiations, which is most regrettable. Mutual trust must be sought first if countries cooperate. The act of amending treaties cannot reassure countries or increase their trust. The result is only to provoke resolute resistance. For the sake of international peace, the Little Entente countries believe that all countries should pay attention to this. For this reason, the Little Entente countries believe that the powers of the respective countries should be concentrated and devoted to the work of building peace. There is no other way to maintain world peace and security."</p>
<p>Britain's</p>
<h3>Position Gradually Consolidated</h3>
<p>Optimistic Words from Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th: Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain spoke optimistically about Britain's future in Birmingham last night, asking the people to trust the government so that the government could complete its work, saying that Britain's credit system has now been fully restored. People from other countries are now flocking to England, believing England to be a safer place. Britain, which had fallen to the world's third-largest exporter, has now regained its position as the world's first-largest exporter. More than two hundred new factories in Britain have been established with foreign investment, and no fewer than twenty foreign governments have asked to negotiate new commercial treaties with Britain. British agriculture has now been thoroughly reorganized, and farmers currently have greater hope and confidence in the future. As for the problem of the new Indian political system, it is very difficult. The government is well aware of the dangers, but it can eventually solve this problem by approaching it with patience, goodwill, wisdom, and perseverance. In the past week, the European situation has undergone great changes as a result of the British Prime Minister's visit to Geneva and Rome. The interests of British strategy have always been in maintaining peace, but it is not entirely true to say that we do not want to fight. In fact, what we want is a step further than fighting, to do our best to mediate and relieve other countries from the scourge of war. This is our responsibility.</p>
<p>There Is Talk of Revising and</p>
<h3>Redistributing Mandated Territories</h3>
<p>According to the Tokyo Jiji Shinpo, on the 20th, the London newspapers, regarding the meeting between British Prime Minister MacDonald and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, used Mussolini's peace treaty proposal as the theme, writing extensively about the content of the meeting and adding various explanations. Among them, the Conservative Party-related newspapers published a theory of redistributing mandated territories, the gist of which was "Mussolini agreed to MacDonald's disarmament proposal on the condition that the mandated territories of the League of Nations be revised and redistributed. For example, some of the small territories currently under British mandate will be ceded to Italy. Italy's supply of necessary raw materials will be increased from these regions. " (According to Japanese reports, after Britain released the news of the redistribution, it was extremely panicked, fearing that the South Pacific mandated territories would also be distributed to other countries.)</p>
<h3>Closing Ceremony of the Japanese Diet</h3>
<p>Fifty-One Government Bills Passed</p>
<p>Saito's Fate Hinges on Meeting with Prince Saionji</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 26th: The 64th Diet concluded uneventfully yesterday. The closing ceremony was held in the House of Peers at 11:00 AM today. According to the Imperial Household Ordinance, the Emperor did not have to attend in person. Prime Minister Saito and other cabinet members, the speakers and vice-speakers of both houses, and Diet members successively entered the House from 9:00 AM, forgetting the political battles of yesterday and gathering together in joy. The bell rang at 10:00 AM to open the meeting. Prime Minister Saito proceeded to the throne, performed the most respectful bow, and received the Imperial Edict held by the Chief Cabinet Secretary. Amidst the most respectful bows of the officials, he held it and read it aloud. Speaker Tokugawa received the Imperial Edict, completed the ceremony, and withdrew.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 26th: After the Diet ended yesterday, Prime Minister Saito told reporters that he was very pleased that the Diet had closed uneventfully. He will pay full attention to the implementation of the budget. In the future, he will concentrate on reorganizing the tax system, financial reform, and administrative legal bills. Of the 53 bills submitted by the government, 51 were passed by both houses, and only two were not deliberated. The government must work harder on the diplomatic issues, ideological issues, and financial issues after withdrawing from the League of Nations. There are many domestic and foreign affairs now, and we are still in an extraordinary situation. The government can only be more aware of its increased efforts.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 26th: Now that the 64th Diet has ended, if the Saito Cabinet violates the expectations of the Seiyukai and maintains its government, the Seiyukai's anti-government attitude will inevitably increase. Although Prime Minister Saito said at the closing of the Diet that he had not yet left the extraordinary situation and would continue to take responsibility in the future, it is doubtful whether the current cabinet, which includes Seiyukai cabinet members, can proceed smoothly without problems of disunity. The issue of responsibility for Justice Minister Oyama and Education Minister Hatoyama cannot be ignored. In short, Prime Minister Saito's visit to Prince Saionji on the 6th or 7th will truly determine the direction of the current government.</p>
<p>World Astronomers</p>
<h3>Gather on Uninhabited Islands in the South Pacific</h3>
<h3>to Observe the Solar Eclipse</h3>
<p>Nichi-Ren, Tokyo, 26th: Famous astronomers from around the world will gather on an uninhabited island in the South Pacific to observe the total solar eclipse and study important issues in astrophysics. Japan has decided to send Dr. Saotome of the Tokyo Observatory and Dr. Yamaki of the Kyoto Kasan Observatory to participate in the research. The uninhabited island is an isolated island in the open sea, with many reefs nearby, making it difficult to navigate. Ordinary ships cannot go there. The Japanese Navy authorities, in order to assist this valuable academic research, have dispatched the warship Komahashi to escort the group.</p>

<p>World League Against Anti-Semitism</p>
<h3>Announces Boycott of German Goods</h3>
<p>Unless the Tyranny Worsens, the Holy See Wishes to Intervene</p>
<p>Political Prisoners in German Prisons Are Not Being Tortured</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th: The World League Against Anti-Semitism, which had previously announced a boycott of German goods, today re-announced the boycott and extended it to German-owned restaurants and cinemas showing German films, expressing its protest against Germany's treatment of Jews. Rumors that the Pope in Rome would intervene have been denied. According to a Reuters correspondent in the Holy City today, there will be no diplomatic action unless the tyranny worsens. German Reichstag President Göring today told a foreign press correspondent in Berlin that the German government does not want to discriminate against Jews or interfere with their personal freedom. Göring also denied allegations of atrocities and murder, but admitted that there had been "isolated acts" in several cases, but that the government was now making every effort to prevent them from happening again. Foreign news correspondents were allowed by the German authorities to visit the prisons and speak freely with the political prisoners, who were rumored to be tortured or executed in prison. Communist leaders Thälmann and Torgler were among those detained. The Reuters correspondent met them at the police headquarters. Thälmann said that he was not suffering and had not been insulted. The others were the same. However, the author of "War," Lenn, criticized the food, accommodation, and general treatment in prison harshly. According to a senior police officer, there are currently 5,000 to 6,000 political prisoners in detention in Germany, and many of them have asked to be detained to avoid accidents. Since the government decided that Jews would no longer be allowed to serve as judges in German courts in Berlin from April 1, the Bavarian Minister of Justice has ordered that Jewish judges should not preside in criminal or admonition courts in the future, and Jewish prosecutors should not be allowed to serve as state lawyers.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 25th: A temporary committee has now been established in France to provide relief to Jews who are being treated unfairly in Germany. Former Prime Minister Painlevé and the Chief Rabbi of France are among the members.</p>
<p>Hitler</p>
<h3>Reconciles with Key Party Figures</h3>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 25th: It seems that Prime Minister Hitler and former key figure of the National Socialist Party Strasser will be reconciled. During General Schleicher's tenure as Federal Chancellor last December, Strasser strongly advocated cooperation between the National Socialist Party and the Schleicher cabinet. Hitler did not approve, and the two became estranged. As a result, Strasser was also dismissed. Since then, Strasser has not engaged in political activities.</p>

<p>Havas, London, 25th: The Bank of England purchased cash worth £950,000 today. Since January of this year, the Bank of England has purchased cash worth approximately £50 million.</p>
<h3>Advocating Afforestation to Accommodate the Unemployed</h3>
<p>American Labor Party Organs Oppose Wage Issues</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 26th: The Labor Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives today discussed President Roosevelt's plan to organize 250,000 people to undertake afforestation work to accommodate the unemployed. Labor Party organs have serious objections to this plan, especially dissatisfied with the proposal to pay afforestation workers one dollar a day. American Federation of Labor President Green delivered a speech today, attacking the method of hindering wage standards in peacetime labor groups. He advocated that afforestation workers should be paid standard wages.</p>
<h3>Dutch Postpones Tea Production Restriction Plan</h3>
<p>| Implementation Delayed |</p>
<p>Reuters, The Hague, 25th: The Dutch Colonial Department announced that the plan to restrict tea production in Dutch territories has been postponed from April 1. However, if tea growers in India and Ceylon implement the same plan, the Dutch East Indies may also implement it from April 15.</p>
<h3>The Extremely Sharpened Conflict Between France and Italy, Paris Correspondence (February 25th)</h3>
<p>Mussolini Implements a Counterattack</p>
<p>The Little Entente's Solidarity is Strengthened</p>
<p>People Severely Warn of the Danger of War</p>
<p>The conflict between the allied nations within France's sphere of influence and the fascist nations of Italy, Hungary, and Germany is continuously intensifying day by day. The focal point of the conflict, as before, lies on one hand in the arbitrary denial of the "Fascist Triangular Alliance," and on the other hand in the firm affirmation of the existence of the "Fascist Triangular Alliance." Mussolini vehemently declared in a cabinet meeting, "The news regarding the conclusion of an Italian-Hungarian-German alliance is simply unfounded. If the Foreign Affairs Committee did not mention this matter, then there would be no need to deny such news." At the same time, Mussolini published an essay, noting that it was written in Rome so that everyone would know who the author was. In this essay, Mussolini attacked France with unprecedented severity, saying that France's utterly excessive attempt to spread rumors is tantamount to openly disrupting peace. France spreads this poisonous atmosphere, causing confusion and unrest among the people of Europe. Who would still believe that France truly cherishes peace? In reality, France refuses to disarm, but in order to deceive others, it deliberately constructs secret alliances and castles in the air about war disasters on the banks of the Rhine and the Alps. No one has threatened France; only France, with its excessively enlarged military equipment, its selfishness, its complete ignorance of the needs of other nations, its allies, and its newspapers bought by the military industry, threatens Europe and the world.</p>
<p>This essay is like adding fuel to the fire. This challenging tone will naturally cause the expected reaction in France, but it has also aroused many comments in Germany. General Stohnegel's fascist newspaper, the "Berliner," seems like a schoolboy, very happy to see his brother scolding people so happily.</p>
<p>"Here, at least in a semi-official statement, France is exposed as the destroyer of peace, a great conspirator, and a cruel politician. The tone used in Mussolini's essay is the sharpest ever. Since the war, no such harsh tone has been used between European countries, not even by the former Allies. Due to the current vigorous instigation by France, a stormy mood is enveloping Rome and Paris. Mussolini's words are a manifestation of this stormy mood."</p>
<p>Indeed, these words are a manifestation of a stormy mood, and the so-called storm is the future new world war. Now, it is not just issuing declarations of war; the actual actions are enough to expose the severity of the danger of war, and they are everywhere.</p>
<p>Among France's protectorates, the solidarity of the "Little Entente" countries is further strengthened. Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia must act together and establish a joint "Permanent Committee" for leadership. Undoubtedly, this new treaty has political significance. It is naturally aimed at opposing the Italian-Hungarian-German attempt to change the European sphere of influence. The "Berliner" wrote about this,</p>
<p>"Yesterday's news about the close solidarity of the Little Entente will similarly affect the progress of European politics. This solidarity is clearly against Italy, Hungary, and Germany. This solidarity is France's last attempt. France only wants to reunite Czechoslovakia with Romania, which is already economically and financially bankrupt, and Yugoslavia, which is threatened by internal turmoil, to make them guardians of Versailles and "Trianon" (also in Versailles, the site of the 1919 treaty between Hungary and the Allies)."</p>
<p>In Belgrade (the capital of Yugoslavia) and Bucharest (the capital of Romania), the arrival of war is being calculated very seriously. A Vienna correspondent for a certain newspaper said, "...The mood in southeastern Europe is deteriorating day by day. People believe that the arrival of war seems like it is tomorrow."</p>
<p>The mood in Warsaw (the capital of Poland) is the same. Recent debates in parliament clearly show that the government party, from the Social Democrats and fake opposition parties all the way to the right wing, are all exhibiting a mood for war.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, France's influence has undoubtedly greatly expanded. Because Poland fears German invasion and Yugoslavia fears Italian invasion, the French government has taken advantage of this opportunity to consolidate the already unreliable "Godingen-Salonika route."</p>
<p>The French government has not shown any surprising skill in this effort. The victories the French government has achieved are almost unearned.</p>
<p>In many challenging speeches and essays north and south of the Alps, the question is often repeatedly asked, under whose help are these governments built, or are they under British help? The British government's attitude at the disarmament conference is a warning. The British [blank space] Eden's proposal to add a new clause to the Cairo Convention (that no conflict should be resolved by force under any circumstances) is just an attempt to temporarily delay the conference. The Frankfurter Zeitung (February 16th) published a London dispatch, pointing out that Britain does not believe that France is in danger of war, in order to later reach the following conclusion,</p>
<p>"When the British government was reorganized recently, some people in London wished that German foreign policy would not change. An interview in the Sunday Express completely shattered this illusion. In addition, anyone who pays attention to politics must point out that Germany has surprisingly lost its foundation in British political circles as a result of the new government's change in domestic strategy."</p>
<p>Since the German Fascists cannot get help from Britain, can they get help from the Soviet Union? Fascist government newspapers like the Berliner are vigorously promoting that the Hitler government's anti-communist domestic policy will absolutely not affect relations with the Soviet Union. The Frankfurter Zeitung (February 14th), on the other hand, contradicts this. It is very worried and affirms that France is constantly striving to establish closer relations between France and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>"Of course, it cannot be said that the French government directly intends to conclude a military alliance with the Soviet Union, but the French government is working hard to stabilize the East, and in certain circumstances, it would not hesitate to conclude a certain military agreement. The Soviet Union's position is advancing every hour. If Germany and the Soviet Union had relations before, then it can now be said that these relations have completely disappeared. The Prime Minister's goal of defeating communism greatly helps France's efforts to win over the Soviet Union. This is natural."</p>
<p>The Frankfurter Zeitung has been carrying out a campaign against the danger of war for a week. This is the demand of a part of the German bourgeoisie. This part of the bourgeoisie is very afraid that the imperialist bourgeoisie's adventurous war will put German capitalism in greater danger than in 1918. The newspaper points out the danger of war and repeatedly declares, "Here (Paris), according to the existing signs, people are severely warning of the danger of war. This is terrible, but it must be said."</p>
<p>Yes, there is a danger of war in Paris, Marseille, Prague, Belgrade, Bucharest, as well as Rome, Budapest, and Berlin, and the danger of war is growing day by day.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Decides to Complete the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Railway</h3>
<p>The Lechang to Luojiadu Section Will Be Constructed Immediately</p>
<p>The Construction Funds of 7 Million Yuan Have Also Been Raised</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section of the Yuehan Railway was previously planned by the Guangzhou-Shaoguan Railway Bureau, intending to allocate two-thirds of the Boxer Indemnity to construction costs, and also planning to issue 40 million yuan of Zhuzhou-Shaoguan public bonds starting from March of this year. Later, due to the increasing national crisis, the Ministry of Finance temporarily suspended the allocation of the indemnity, and the construction plan was hit. Li Xiangen, Director of the Guangzhou-Shaoguan Railway Bureau, went to Beijing a few days ago to discuss everything with the Ministries of Finance and Railways. After reaching an agreement with Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, Li returned south yesterday. It is reported that three plans for the construction of the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section have been formulated as follows: (1) The original plan for the completion of the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section and the purchase of various locomotives for the Guangzhou-Shaoguan Railway will not be changed. (2) The original proposal to construct the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section from both ends simultaneously will be cancelled and changed to constructing directly from the south. It is now found that the section from Shaoguan to Liputou has been built and opened to traffic. The section from Liputou to Lechang is expected to be completed and opened to traffic in April of this year. At the end of April, construction will continue on the road from Lechang to Luojiadu (Luojiadu [blank space] is located in Pingshi). The engineering of this section of the road [blank space] can be opened for bidding during the day, and merchants have also arrived in Guangdong to prepare for bidding. (3) Regarding the issue of construction funds for the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Railway this year, it is found that the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Railway can be built to Luojiadu from March of this year to March of next year. The construction funds required during this year are about 7 million yuan. It has been decided that the Ministries of Railways and Finance will each allocate half of this amount. The remaining shortfall of about 1 million yuan will be the responsibility of the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Guangzhou-Shaoguan Railway Bureau to raise. (20th)</p>
<p>Northern Anhui</p>
<h3>The Special Goods Office is Abolished</h3>
<p>It Operated for Several Months Without Success</p>
<p>It Was Ordered to Close Immediately</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Feng Yafo, the Special Commissioner for the Collection and Transportation of Special Goods in Northern Anhui, came to Bengbu last winter and set up an office in Runfuli. He appointed a large number of collectors and transporters, who went to various counties to collect and transport goods in person. Their method of collection and transportation was entirely a policy of prohibition in the guise of taxation. It was called collection and transportation, but in reality, it was taxation. However, since the opening of the collection, due to the poor management of the office, more than three months have passed, and there have been no results. The quotas in each county are too heavy, with some reaching as high as 70,000 or 80,000 or more. At a time when the people are poor and resources are exhausted, there is no income, so very few county branches report monthly remittances. The head office only received several thousand yuan in guarantee deposits from the collectors and transporters in each county. The authorities were very dissatisfied with this and immediately ordered the abolition of the Special Goods Office in Northern Anhui. Feng Yafo was appointed as the Special Commissioner for the Investigation and Prohibition of Tobacco Seedlings in Anhui. Feng set up an office in Anqing to investigate and prohibit tobacco seedlings and specialized in investigating and prohibiting tobacco seedlings. He came to Bengbu from the province a few days ago to handle the closure of the Special Goods Office. After the closure was completed, he returned to the province with the important personnel of the head office. After the Special Goods Head Office was closed clearly, the Bengbu Inspection Office of this tobacco special goods depot and the branch offices in various counties in Northern Anhui were also ordered to close in order. It is reported that many collectors and transporters in each county suffered losses as a result. (23rd)</p>
<h3>A Military and Police Inspectorate is Re-established in Bengbu</h3>
<p>Responsible for Maintaining Public Security</p>
<p>Directly Under the Jurisdiction of the Garrison Department</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Since the Bengbu Garrison Headquarters was abolished and Xu Tingyao went north to participate in the war of resistance against Japan, the defense of this area has been undertaken by the 37th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the 7th Division, commanded by Wang Kaizhen. However, the garrison matters of the Jinpu Railway are still the responsibility of Wang Jun, Commander of the Third Army. Wang believes that Bengbu is located in a strategic location on the Jinpu Railway, and the public security of the area is extremely important. There was previously a Military and Police Inspectorate in Bengbu, which was directly under the jurisdiction of the Jinpu Railway Garrison Headquarters. Now that the situation is unstable, the Military and Police Inspectorate should be restored as soon as possible. Therefore, Wang Kaizhen, Commander of the 37th Regiment stationed in Bengbu, was specially appointed as the concurrent Director of the Inspectorate. It will be organized immediately and is scheduled to take office before the 25th. Regarding the expenses, local consultations will be held, and at least 1,500 yuan will be required. Therefore, a special letter was sent to the Chamber of Commerce to discuss raising funds to facilitate the process. After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce invited representatives from various agencies and public associations to a meeting at 3:00 pm on the 23rd to discuss the matter. As a result, it was agreed to undertake 1,000 yuan per month. The method of apportionment is that, in addition to an additional two yuan per geisha from the geisha singing donation, the rest will be undertaken by the tax collection agencies and major merchants separately. The amount apportioned by each bank will be undertaken by the Banking Association for 100 yuan, and the Chamber of Commerce will immediately inform Commander Wang of this by letter. (24th)</p>
<p>All Shanghai Organizations</p>
<h3>Will Suggest a Wartime Organization to the Central Government</h3>
<p>To Control the National Economy, Military Affairs, and Transportation</p>
<p>The Federation of All Chinese Industries is Currently Negotiating</p>
<p>The Federation of All Chinese Industries held a reception for public organizations and the press at the Bank Association Club at 5:00 pm yesterday to discuss and suggest that the Central Government establish a political center to control military, economic, and transportation affairs to facilitate the overall resistance against the enemy. The details of the various news items are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Participating Public Organizations</h3>
<p>Those who attended last night included representatives from the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Citizens' Federation, the Journalists' Association, the Federation of Machine-Made National Goods Factories, the Shipping Association, the Shanghai National Goods Factories Federation, and other organizations, as well as representatives from the Qingdao, Suzhou, and other branches of the Federation, totaling more than 20 people. They were warmly received by Qian Chengxu of the Federation and Lin Kanghou of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>During the meeting, the Chairman said in his speech, "Fellow comrades, the guests today are either celebrities in the industrial and commercial circles or leaders from various regions. Discussing and consulting on the grand plan of resisting Japan and saving the nation can be said to be a rare opportunity. Today, we are facing a major national crisis. First, we must ask ourselves, from the standpoint of the people, whether it is industry or commerce, or other professions, whether we want to save the country. Second, if we want to save the country, in the current emergency and serious situation, how can we save the country? I have carefully considered these two points, and the current situation in China presents this phenomenon: on the part of the masses, there is a lack of unity, so the various organizations cannot be very strong. In the political aspect, the distribution of powers is too fragmented, so the power of the center cannot be generated to deal with this special crisis. However, adversity builds a nation. There is this lesson from ancient times. A nation must be able to devise a solution based on its own position and circumstances in order to save itself. The situation in China is exactly like this. From a positive point of view, it can be said that it is not a phenomenon of national subjugation, but a sign of national revival. The colleagues of our association have asked ourselves that, at such a serious time in the overall situation in China, we must do some work to save the country. Therefore, a few days ago, after everyone gathered to discuss, we formulated a draft telegram to be submitted to the Central Government, advocating that the Central Government transform the current government into a wartime organization, concentrate powers, and control military, economic, and transportation affairs to facilitate the overall external response. However, from our own standpoint, the Federation of All Chinese Industries is purely an industrial group. This type of work and design for saving the country is of great importance and cannot be undertaken by relying on the strength of a local organization. Therefore, I have specially invited various public organizations tonight and for the next two days, and at the same time, I will present this draft to ask the guests present to seriously discuss and vote on it, and also ask the guests present to publicly elect a chairman to preside over tonight's meeting, etc."</p>

<p>After the various organizations discussed on the spot, they passed the principle and advocated that after the Federation of All Chinese Industries first receives various public organizations next Monday, they will then schedule another tea party to discuss the final steps to make a strong recommendation to the government.</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Proposal</h3>
<p>The association decided to hold a general meeting after receiving various public organizations on the 28th and 29th to pass a proposal to the Central Government to change the government into a wartime organization. The proposal (1) advocates that a person be appointed to be responsible for controlling the military, training elite troops, and implementing a national military deployment plan to defend against the enemy. (2) The Central Government should make overall plans to organize a wartime financial institution outside the wartime government to control the national economy. (3) Organize a military transportation agency to control national transportation.</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan Talks About Determination to Resist the Enemy</p>
<h3>Recovering Lost Territory Is Not Difficult</h3>
<p>The Volunteer Army in the East is Active and Waiting for an Opportunity to Move</p>
<p>This Time He is Here to Negotiate Relief for Northeastern Refugees</p>
<p>General Zhu [illegible character] Xian, recently seeing the expansion of the anti-Japanese military in North China, and the increasing number of refugees in the Northeast, and the need for huge amounts of funds for resettlement, which cannot be collected from one corner of the north, specially came south to negotiate with various charitable organizations in Shanghai, in order to achieve great results. Zhu arrived in Shanghai last night. The reporter specially visited Zhu at his private residence this morning. The following is a record of Zhu's remarks:</p>
<p>Negotiating for Relief for Refugees Zhu first said that he came here entirely to provide relief for refugees in the north, because after the fall of Rehe and the three eastern provinces, refugees from various places are increasingly concentrated in Pingjin and other places, and the war is expanding day by day, and wounded soldiers are also being transported to the rear one after another. The resettlement matters require huge expenses, so I personally came to Shanghai to negotiate with various circles in Shanghai, and plan to invite some people to help in the north. I will return north as soon as the negotiations are settled.</p>
<p>The Volunteer Army is Active and Waiting to Move The people in the Northeast are suffering unspeakable pain under the iron heel of the enemy. They look forward to the government being able to recover the non-land. Although the Japanese army is frequently invading, as long as the hearts of the people across the country do not die, and they are determined to resist, there is no fear that they will not be able to recover the lost territory. Therefore, the volunteer army in the hinterland of the eastern provinces is active, and if they get an opportunity, they can rise up at any time.</p>
<p>The Battle Situation on the Front is Very Good As for the battle situation on the front, the situation has been very good recently, because the troops are mostly determined to die, and everywhere they can use a very small number of troops to intercept the enemy unexpectedly. There was once a Big Sword Team soldier who cut down ten enemies in a row, resulting in his injury. As for the supply to the front, due to the inconvenience of transportation, there are indeed many difficulties in reality, but the rear must decide on a fundamental solution to provide supply. Recently, when Song Zheyuan's troops were fighting, at a time of emergency in the war, the transportation of food to the front was entirely done by local residents, etc.</p>

The Shanghai Relief Federation for Northeastern Refugees, the Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association Local Association, and other organizations have appointed representatives to go to the Jinliyuan Wharf at the appointed time to welcome them and have hired many moving trucks for loading luggage.</p>
<p>The Nissin Company's Ships</p>
<h3>Internal Decision on Shipping Routes</h3>
<p>[A total of seven lines, none of which are commercially viable]</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun, the seven shipping routes of the Nissin Company, centered on Shanghai, have been hit by extreme anti-Japanese sentiment and the conflict between the Chinese and Japanese armies. The business has been increasingly declining since this year. Since April of last year, the number of voyages on the designated shipping routes in one year was about 230, but in reality, it was less than 100. However, the designated shipping routes, which are usually changed in April every year, have been internally decided by the Ministry of Communications as follows: (1) Shanghai-Hankou Line, four ships, more than 120 voyages. (2) Hankou-Yichang Line, two ships, 48 voyages. (3) Hankou-Xiangtan Line, one ship, 24 voyages. (4) Shanghai-Tianjin Line, two ships, 36 voyages. (5) Shanghai-Guangdong Line, two ships, 36 voyages. (6) Yichang-Chongqing Line, one ship, number of voyages not determined. (7) Hankou-Changde Line, one ship, number of voyages not determined. The Hankou-Yichang, Hankou-Xiangtan, Tianjin-Shanghai, Shanghai-Guangdong, Yichang-Chongqing, and Hankou-Changde lines all have no business to speak of.</p>

<p>Order from the Trademark Bureau</p>
<h3>Improving Cotton Classification Standards</h3>
<p>He Zhuoxian, Director of the Trademark Bureau, believes that there are different grades and varieties of white cotton in China. There are five main standards. When the China Cotton Production Improvement Association held a meeting in Beijing a few days ago, Director Ye was sent to Beijing to participate, and brought rough [illegible character] standard one [illegible character] and various [illegible character] to attend, soliciting opinions from experts on the grades tried and set by the bureau. After detailed discussion by the experts, it was felt that the names of the various standards were still not very perfect. Therefore, after Director Ye returned to the bureau this time, he specially ordered the standard names to be improved as follows: (1) Lingbao Long-Staple American Cotton Grade Standard was changed to Long-Staple American Cotton Grade Standard. (2) American Cotton Grade Standard was changed to Short-Staple American Cotton Grade Standard. (3) Black-Seeded Fine Lint Grade Standard was changed to Black-Seeded Medium Cotton Grade Standard. (4) White-Seeded Coarse Lint Grade Standard was changed to White-Seeded Medium Cotton Grade Standard. (5) Tianjin Hard Lint Grade Standard was changed to Special Hard Lint Grade Standard.</p>

<h3>Difficult to Rescue the Yutong Ship</h3>
<p>The First and Second Holds are 15 Feet Underwater</p>
<p>The Ship's Passenger and Cargo Losses Total 260,000</p>
<p>The Yutong Ship of the Yu Da Shipping Company ran aground near Xinghua, Fujian. The ship is sinking, and the situation is extremely critical. It seems that it will be impossible to rescue. The total loss of passengers and cargo on the ship is about 260,000 yuan. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Critical Situation The Yu Da Shipping Company received a telegram from the Xinghua Branch this morning stating that the bottom of the front hold of the Yutong Ship has broken, and seawater has entered the first and second holds, increasing from 13 feet to 15 feet. The ship's draft is five feet when the tide is low. The engine room and the rear hold are unharmed. Due to bad weather, rescue [illegible character]. Currently, Lianbao Shui [illegible character] Company has commissioned a Japanese salvage company to send a ship from Moji to the accident site to rescue. It is scheduled to [illegible character] tonight.</p>
<p>Total Loss of Passengers and Cargo The Coast Guard of the Military Department sent a patrol ship from Xiamen to the accident site, which arrived last night. It is stationed next to the Yutong Ship at the accident site to prevent pirates from robbing it. As for the crew of the ship, although they have been rescued, the 1,700 tons of passengers and cargo, soybean cakes, etc., worth 120,000 yuan, are completely wet and swollen, and it is impossible to load and unload them. The price of the ship is about 140,000 yuan. Because the passengers and cargo cannot be loaded and unloaded, it is difficult to escape the danger in reality, and it has already sunk. The insurance companies of Dalian for the passengers and cargo have sent personnel to inspect.</p>

<h3>The Monastery's Meditation Hall Turns Into an Opium Den</h3>
<p>Three Sets of Opium Smoking Equipment Seized Inside Bao Lao Ye Temple</p>
<p>More Than Ten Young Women Also Found Inside the Temple</p>
<p>| Abbot Zhang Wenyu and Others Sentenced to One Month Imprisonment Each |</p>
<p>Inside Bao Lao Ye Temple, located at No. 542-3 Tunan Lane, North Henan Road, reside more than thirty monks. The abbot, Zhang Wenyu, is deeply addicted to opium. Recently, this abbot, seeing that most of the monks in the temple shared his addiction, prepared extra opium equipment to prevent profits from flowing elsewhere. He set up a secret den in a more secluded monk's room, so they could all enjoy the taste of "sweet dew." Thus, besides chanting sutras every day, they only indulged in smoking opium. This was discovered by Inspector Yao Jialin of District C, who believed that turning a monastery meditation hall into an opium den was a severe violation of the law. He petitioned the First Special District Local Court for a search warrant and, on the afternoon of the other day, braved the rain to search the temple. Most of the monks were out, and only the abbot, along with incense caretakers Xiao Dexing, Pan Bosheng, and Guo Chunlai, were lying on the bed, indulging in their addiction. They were all arrested, and three sets of opium equipment, two jars of opium paste, and sixty-nine rolls of dried opium were seized. At that time, more than ten young women suddenly appeared inside the temple. Inspector Yao Jialin, seeing that they did not resemble ordinary worshippers, questioned them suspiciously. The women confessed in unison that they were all wives of the monks in the temple. For monks who were supposed to have emptied the five skandhas and purified the six senses, to suddenly have beautiful wives living with them in the monastery was truly unheard of. This further demonstrated the temple's usual practice of harboring filth and hiding dirt. After witnessing this strange phenomenon, Inspector Yao Jialin sneered at it and immediately took Zhang Wenyu and the other three, along with the opium equipment, back to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought before Judge Huang Risheng of the First Special District Local Court for interrogation. Lawyers Li Zhishan and Zhang Shizhu from the police station stated that the defendants would be prosecuted for violating Article 11 of the Anti-Opium Law. Subsequently, Inspector Yao Jialin reported the details of the case, and when asked by Judge Huang, the defendants Zhang Wenyu and others confessed to smoking opium without denial. Judge Huang then sentenced the four defendants, Zhang, Xiao, Pan, and Guo, to one month imprisonment each, and confiscated the opium paste and opium equipment.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Regulations</p>
<h3>Procedures for Handling Unidentified Corpses</h3>
<p>| Circular Order to All District Stations to Comply |</p>
<p>Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently issued a circular order to all district police captains, stating that in order to ensure compliance, it has been found that the reporting procedures for unidentified corpses discovered within the jurisdiction of each district station are inconsistent, and the sizes of corpse photographs also vary, as do the reported photography costs. Unless proper measures are established and uniformly enforced, it will be insufficient to ensure uniformity and demonstrate prudence. Eight procedures for handling unidentified corpses discovered within the jurisdiction of each district station have now been established. In addition to separate orders and distribution, a copy of these procedures is hereby issued to all district stations for immediate compliance. This order.</p>

(3) For corpses that died of illness, seven photographs shall be taken, one to be kept by the district station for public announcement and claim, and the remaining six, one each to be kept by the Records Section and one to be posted at the Bureau's entrance for public recognition, and four to be sent to major newspapers for public recognition, to be sent to the Bureau with a prepared document.

<p>Special Issue on the Lives of Female Employees (II)</p>
<p>Casual Chats by Ye Yu</p>
<h3>Words from a "Weaver"</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Five minutes before going to press, I calculated the number of words in the manuscripts compiled for this issue, and it was still four hundred and fifty words short. Naturally, this requires us editors to "weave" some more.</p>
<p>Several readers have written to us seeking our opinions on improving the lives of female workers and female employees. This puts us in a bit of a difficult position:</p>
<p>First, in this era where mentioning workers and employees immediately conjures up thoughts of "left-leaning" and "right-leaning," it is very difficult to speak. You must at least weigh your words on a scale before you can say them, otherwise, you will either be accused of "tailism" or "left-wing infantile disorder," or someone will say that you are a "backward person of the times!"</p>
<p>Second, the universal spread of the world economic panic has made the lives of the general working masses increasingly impoverished. All the Hoover saints and all the MacDonalds, despite exhausting various methods of improvement and relief, still cannot solve the unemployment problem and other livelihood issues in the slightest. Then, needless to say, the humble editors like us are even less capable. I know I can avoid playing an axe in front of Lu Ban!</p>
<p>In short, if female employees want to alleviate their own suffering, they can only turn to themselves and rely on their own continuous efforts and struggles. Others cannot do it for them. Moreover, the social science that female employees learn from their own life struggles is much richer and more accurate than what we editors sitting in the library learn every day! Dear readers! Do you want to know the secret to improving your lives? I'll tell you, please go ask the great gentlemen!</p>
<p>Life of the Masses</p>
<h3>Prison</h3>
<p>— Ms. Yi Ling</p>
<p>Female Telephone Operator</p>
<p>I used to work as a telephone operator in a concession telephone company in a certain port. Many women envied this profession, thinking that we led a happy life. But this is because they don't know the inside story, and they don't know how much pain and humiliation we suffered there!</p>
<p>Although our working hours are not as long as those of female factory workers, we have to do more than seven hours of monitored work every day. As soon as we run into the company, we feel like we have entered a prison. We work like machines all day long, without a minute to be lazy. Being five minutes late results in half a day's pay being deducted. In the switchboard room where I worked, there were seven or eight foreign female "Four Nine Nine" and a dozen Chinese female "Four Nine Nine." "Four Nine Nine" means supervisor. They are like foremen in a factory, patrolling around all day long. If they see anyone being lazy or talking, they will scold you or tell the manager. The manager will immediately call you in and give you a big lecture.</p>
<p>Our manager is a tall and thin American woman. She is very strict. Her seat is in the center, looking around and monitoring us. She has a receiver on her desk. Her receiver is different from the switchboard operator's receiver, but the same as the ordinary telephone user's receiver. But her receiver has special uses. When she puts the receiver to her ear, she can immediately know which station is talking among the hundreds of us. Once, a colleague talked to a man outside for a few words. It happened that the manager was listening to the receiver at this time. She heard it, and immediately stood up and sneaked behind the colleague like a mouse, and pulled her shoulders hard with both hands, which startled the colleague. The colleague turned around and saw that it was the manager, and her face turned red. The manager asked her what she was doing, and then called her over and scolded her in front of everyone. Finally, she spoke in broken Shanghai dialect: "Be careful, be careful!"</p>
<p>This is an imperialist money-making machine, the best example of imperialist exploitation. Although we only have ten or twenty yuan a month, we have to deduct wages for taking leave here: half a day's leave deducts a full day's pay; one day's leave deducts three days' pay; sick leave deducts half a day's pay, and it must be certified by a designated hospital.</p>
<p>Another thing that is most heartbreaking is that even urinating is restricted. You have to report to "Four Nine Nine" when you urinate. The time is only allowed for five minutes, and defecation is also only allowed for five minutes! Running from the work station to the staircase, and from the staircase to the toilet on the second floor takes two or three minutes. The limit of five minutes is really not enough. If someone goes to the toilet a few more times due to physical discomfort, the manager will call her in for questioning again. But the manager and foreign staff on the second floor don't have to run up the stairs, and their time is not restricted. But no matter who they are, they always spend more than ten minutes in the toilet each time. This is probably because their physiological structure is somewhat different from ours!</p>
<p>I worked so hard for three years, until the company installed automatic machines, and the January 28th Incident happened at this time. The company took the opportunity of our escape to dismiss us, so as to avoid us asking for unemployment compensation. In this way, my switchboard operator's life came to an end.</p>

<h3>Female Store Clerks and Abortion</h3>
<p>— Wu Wenbo</p>
<p>Because I studied medicine, I hung up a sign as a gynecologist in the French Concession. Once, I performed an abortion for a female employee of Company ×, who had severe lung disease and was not suitable for childbearing. From then on, many female store clerks came to discuss this issue. But I had been a criminal defendant for performing abortions before. The judge scolded me, saying: You say that female workers cannot work without abortions, and cannot eat without work. Moreover, the pregnancy is not yet three months old, and there is no danger to the adult if it is aborted, so I gave it to her. But that is Soviet law, not Chinese law. Therefore, I sat in jail for three months. Since then, when female store clerks come to me to discuss this matter, I refuse and say: Give birth to it this time, and a little baby is also very cute. If you don't want to give birth next time, I can think of a way. You should come and discuss it with me earlier. But they are all determined to "think of a way this time, and don't worry about it next time," and because my clinic is relatively clean, and the fees are very low, there are still people who come to discuss it.</p>
<p>From my old doctor's point of view, although female store clerks are said to be economically independent working women, once they have a lover, if I am not around to interfere, before long the crystallization of love will start to act strangely in their stomachs, and they will feel that they are not as free as young ladies from wealthy families, and they will be busy looking for a solution. This is because economically independent working women are not really independent. The salary that the company gives them is to make them wear a few more beautiful clothes to set off their beauty in order to attract customers, not their real salary. The company will never provide them with all the pre- and post-natal expenses, so their lives are not much different from those of female workers. It is no wonder that they all ask me like this: "So, what should I do with the thing in my stomach?" But I can only answer them like this: "Miss, to borrow the words of the Chinese judge who imprisoned me for three months, please go to the Soviet Union!"</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>said that the right hand wanted to shake my left hand.</p>
<p>"Sir, behave yourself, what else do you want to eat?" I gave him a "nail."</p>
<p>"I can't believe you, you have such a big attitude. Okay, just bring me anything, whiskey, sandwich, butter toast... bring me whatever you want, anyway, I have plenty of money in my pocket." He was a little embarrassed and angry, wanting to use money to overwhelm people, but I still gave him a cold shoulder.</p>
<p>But the boss knew about this. He said that I offended the customer, which would affect his business, so he earnestly taught me a lesson. He said:</p>
<p>"Customers pay money to eat, not to be insulted. They have money, and we also want money. If he asks you how old you are, you tell him how old you are. If he wants to hold you and touch you, you let him hold you and touch you, there is nothing big deal about it. Otherwise, where would you get your big tips, which are several times your monthly salary? If my employees all offended customers like you, wouldn't my store be visited by ghosts? Think about it, wouldn't our store have to close? If it closes, where would you get your big tips, which are several times your monthly salary? So I advise you, don't be so stupid in the future. Whatever they want you to do, you do it. Holding and touching won't cause you any loss anyway..."</p>
<p>"Yes, I am stupid. I can't do such a shameless thing. I can't let them tease me at will. I can't fawn on them." I interrupted the boss before he could continue and answered him simply like that.</p>
<p>"If you work as a waitress in my place, you have to do this. If you don't do it, then please find another job and do what you want to do!" He threatened me with closing the business.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything, and tears streamed down like rain.</p>
<p>Self-Professional Introduction</p>
<h3>A Retinue of Bodyguards</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hai Xiao</p>
<p>Female Civil Servant</p>
<p>Not sitting in the boudoir to embroider phoenixes, I travel to foreign lands for a living, weathering frost and snow, my rosy face withers, my aspirations are not realized, only a sliver remains.</p>
<p>Editor: Thank you. Could you please publish this letter of mine?</p>
<p>I am a civil servant in a certain political organization, but I don't have a retinue of bodyguards because I am not an important person, and I am now considered "retired." Now I enclose a poem and a painting. Please put the poem in front of this letter and the painting in the back. These shallow works, surrounded by a retinue, will be my bodyguards, but I need you to take the time to "inspect" them!</p>

I have served as a civil servant, lawyer's assistant, speech stenographer, middle school dean, director of student affairs, Chinese and art teacher, female student instructor, and private tutor.

<h3>The United Front of the Boss and the Honored Guest</h3>
<p>— Ms. Yun Ling</p>
<p>Waitress in a Coffee Shop</p>
<p>Having worked as a waitress in ××× for more than twenty days, I have tasted all the unfairness of life. What is written below is one of the things I experienced in these twenty-odd days.</p>
<p>The sound of leather shoes "kak-kak" echoed on the stairs. A young man came in, wearing a gorgeous suit, with snow cream on his face and Stanco on his head. This is what my consciousness told me: I had to go forward to greet him.</p>
<p>"Sir, please sit here, what would you like to eat?" In order to solve the problem of food and clothing, I had to endure humiliation and engage in this disguised selling of smiles! A waitress, to serve these young masters and ruffians.</p>
<p>"A cup of coffee!"</p>
<p>While drinking, this young man kept looking at me and laughing to himself. "What is your name?" he asked me.</p>
<p>"My surname is ×." I replied to him simply.</p>
<p>"You look very pretty. How old are you this year?" This ignorant guy asked me further. Seeing that his eyes were flickering with malicious intent, I ignored him.</p>
<p>"Did you hear me? I asked you how old you are this year?" Poor guy, he didn't even know that there was no coffee left in his cup, and he still wanted to put the cup in his mouth.</p>
<p>"Sir, would you like anything else to eat?" I asked him without looking at him directly.</p>
<p>"...I want to eat the red on your lips..." His sly little account came from where? If everyone I employed in my store offended customers like you, wouldn't my store be visited by even ghosts? Think about it, wouldn't our store have to close? If it closes, where would you get your big tips, which are several times your monthly salary? So I advise you, don't be so stupid in the future. Whatever they want you to do, you do it. Touching and holding won't cause you any loss anyway..."</p>
<p>"Yes, I am stupid. I can't do such a shameless thing. I can't let them tease me at will. I can't fawn on them." I didn't wait for the boss to continue and answered him frankly like that.</p>
<p>"If you work as a waitress in my place, you have to do this. If you don't do it, then please find another job and do what you want to do!" He threatened me with closing the business.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything, and tears streamed down like rain.</p>
<h3>Their "Progressive Action" and My "Reactionary Action"</h3>
<p>— Ms. Ai Lian</p>
<p>Female Employee of a Certain Political Organization</p>
<p>It has become a habit for me to read the newspaper every morning. One day, I suddenly discovered a section: "A certain large agency is recruiting two female employees, salary 25 to 35 yuan; middle school education or above, anyone can apply..." Of course, I am a university-educated person, and my qualifications are up to standard, and there is no need for any photos, so I boldly sent a resume. In less than three days, they sent me a mimeographed notice, asking me to go to a certain place to take the exam. I was too happy when I went. Indeed, I am very clear that this is a very famous, dignified government agency. One of my cousins once planned to go, but the person he asked for help was too small, so he failed. Unexpectedly, I easily stepped into this big iron gate. What I am afraid of is not being admitted. When I entered the examination hall, I further proved that I would definitely fail; because among the seventy or so candidates, I knew two who were graduates of a certain university, and one was a professor at my alma mater. In terms of my knowledge, there is little hope, and I have not asked anyone for help!</p>
<p>More than twenty proctors came, all standing. One of them gave a few words first. He said: There are too many of us, so we will switch to oral examinations. So one by one they were called in front of them to ask questions. What they asked, I couldn't hear, but I saw that the twenty or so people were constantly recording in their hands. I didn't understand what they were recording. Does one person's answer require so many people to take notes? Later, they called my name. In addition to some of the information already on the resume, they only asked one more question: "Are you married?"</p>
<p>Quickly, the next afternoon, a letter came. Contrary to anyone's expectations, I was admitted.</p>
<p>I went, and I found that another person who was admitted was a very beautiful person who was about my age. Her surname is Liu. The salary was explained; she was 25 yuan, and I was 35 yuan. From this time on, the secret of the exam had not yet been broken, but another period of mysterious life began!</p>
<p>A week passed, but I didn't handle a single official matter. I always brought a few novels to read every day, spending seven or eight hours. I hadn't signed the attendance book either, because they said that female employees didn't need to sign in. So it didn't matter if I was late, left early, or didn't come at all. As long as a male colleague had nothing to do, he would come to my desk to chat, which was really annoying! They knew that I liked to read novels, so I often found books they gave me in my drawer. I didn't know who bought them, or who to return them to? This made me extremely embarrassed! After a few more days, we got to know each other a little better, and they asked me to dinner, dancing, movies, etc., but I always refused. In order to avoid them bothering me, I always asked my older brother, who worked at the customs, to pick me up when I went home. So some male colleagues hated me a little. There was no opportunity in the office; when I left the office, my brother was waiting for me, they were really helpless.</p>
<p>Ms. Liu, she sat far away from me. I thought she was more knowledgeable than me, she knew how to deal with the world. Playful voices were constantly transmitted to my ears. After leaving the office, there were always two or three male colleagues walking with her. It is said that watching movies is a daily routine. Dancing and suppers are also very common. Once, she even played mahjong all night with five colleagues at × Hotel. For her, it may be that she had to deal with the job for the sake of making a living, and she was at ease with it. At the same time, she could also take advantage of a good opportunity to seek her own pleasure. However, I always disliked her a little, so I rarely talked to her. She asked me to dinner several times, although she declared that there would be no third person with us, but I always declined!</p>
<p>On Sunday morning of the third week after entering a certain agency, Ms. Liu suddenly came to visit me at my residence. Although I had never received colleagues who came to find me, Ms. Liu was a female colleague, and it was her first time, so I was embarrassed to refuse her, so I finally invited her in. She sent me a</p>
