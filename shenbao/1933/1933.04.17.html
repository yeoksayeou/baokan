<p>時評英蘇關係惡化給予遠東之影響　明　　英國六位工程師因犯指揮怠工。破壞蘇聯蘇夫迦廠之嫌而补捕。遂引起英蘇國間極大之衝動。英蘇兩國商務。且受嚴重影響。甚至有斷絶國交之虞。其起因雖徽細。而結果乃十分重大。世界變故。往往如是。蕯拉齊一粒子彈。竟挑動第一次世界大戰。惡鬭四年。直接動因。緃甚微小。但積蓄爆炸性之種種材料。乃逼满世界。英國與蘇聯之間。就表面利害觀察對立衝突。僅同於一般資本主義國與社會主義國之景象似無特殊之不相容處。然而細繹其内容則否英國與蘇聯之不相協在今日兩對立營壘中固愈増明顯。歷史關係。尤不能加以否諰。吾人回憶日俄戰争之前。英俄之間争霸之烈。自小亞細亞沿印度邊境以迄遠東。到處皆形成對峙關係。是以日俄之戰。英國不惜犠牲。其在歐洲荣譽的孤立。而對日成立英日同盟陷俄國波羅的艦隧於不堪作戰境地。蓋西比利亞大鐵道築成。遠東市塲。將受俄國之威脅。是以借日本之力以阻遏其東進也。　頃者俄國大革命之後。其國基日漸穏固。第一五年計剗完成所予世界之影響。更形顯著。而於殖民地之印度。尤感不安。加以土西鐡道成功。势將直迫印度。英人安能不不雨綢繆。預爲自己地步。况蘇聯西進的世界政策遭受阻遏。改而東向。在太平洋籌另一出路。無論在任何地方均與英帝國發生密切關聯。至少亦與英國海外市塲或海外投資。發生嚴重影響。在一般商業競争與金融支配力。蘇聯誠非英國立敵。且膛乎其後。然煤油出産及中歐與遠東市塲上煤油之消售。蘇聯確爲英國之勁敵。矧蘇聯煤油　藏極富。以有計劃之開採與有計劃之傾消。匪特足以左右遠東市塲之煤油價格。且將發生巨大之政治作用。日蘇暫時諒解。即其一例。是以英國不能不借用日本之力以防禦蘇聯。并以保持遠東市塲之安定。維持印度之統制。而日本更利用此種弱點。盡量設法挑撥。使英蘇遠離。以便彼侵略東北。防赤借口。方得實證。　史事姑量不譮。即以九一八瀋變以来來之國際勢。加以亝證。即足明悉其究竟。（公道正義）之美名似皆爲我國所得。但失陷之士地。依萬在敵軍蹂躪之下。武力收復失地。固成高調抵抗到底。亦僅决此誠爲我國自身問題。不能尤人然我中國近数十年一切政治軍事。皆受國際牵聯。以庚子事彬變後爲甚北伐成功以來此種牵制。并未根本解除。而於日本開始以武力侵略東北以嗳遠尤爲明顯。　日本旣審知我國之抵抗。限於局部。彼遂實施各個撃破策略。故無論某一部隧如何堅强設使缺乏全國民之後援。則萬離與頑敵抗戰。缺乏近代殺備。其小焉者也同時彼日本帝國主義者又深知英美之間。不易協調戰債·貿易·金融。在在足以引起糾紛即使協商尚須時日。英蘇兩國又不兩立。於是日本乃得而於中取巧。在攻掠热河之前。自謂不越長城。以稳定列國使不發首。現在更須窺察形勢。試用小規模兵力。以衝動我軍陣缐遂其得寸進尺。逐步蠶食之詭計。同時更假借辛丑條約之名。竟要求由日本軍隧駐紮北寗路沿線。設使此舉能得英國之諒解。我國又不亟起作戰者。則日本將更進一步席卷内蒙。取灤東。而脅制華北矣。當此時也。我國人民。機甚懦關。亦决無再坐待殺戳之理。惟遠東市塲。亦後從此破壤不堪。英國雖老於外交。亦不免爲日本所利用耳。新彊事變有擴大勎　　傳哈密鄯善等處相繼淪陷　　中央擬派員前往調查眞相大趋势、哈密·鄯善·庫車·鳥温蘇·温宿·和闐等處、相纎淪陷、且有進攻迪化之説、中央擬即派員前往調奞眞相、以便處置、（十六日尃電）國府明令派宁子文赴美参加經濟討論我方提案原則大致擬定　　（南京）國府十六日令、特派行政院副院長兼財政部長宋子文前往華府、参加經濟討論、此令、（十六日中央社電）　　（南京）華府舉行之經濟談話會、我國提案問題、財·實·兩部、原擬事前會組專門委員會、負責擬定原則、嗣因時間倉卒、未能成立、按斯會討論要耍點、在安定世界經濟、包括戰債賠欵關税銀價等、我國提案方策、當亦不外乎此、（一）關税問題、我國關税雖已自主、但受昔日之條約束縳、殊欠平等、故我國進口關税税率與各國相較、低於一倍或數倍、斯會宗旨、重在减低關税税率、我國自有深切關係、故須將我國關税之歷來現狀、我國人民與各國人民生活物價之相差、進出口貨物之統計、均須提付討論、俾得今後與各國進出口、通商上得互相平衡之待遇、（二）銀價問題、美總統羅斯福、於斯會主要議案中、有提高銀價廢止金本位之擬議、此與我國關係尤重、我國雖歷受金涨漲銀賤之影變、但據銀界專家意見、現在國内存銀不多、銀價一經高漲、受損亦非淺鮮、故政府當局預料此事之重大、一再邀請宋部長出席、以便乘機應付、（三）戰債問題、我國雖無重大關係、伹際此暴日特强侵略、刦奪我國關税之時、致我收入鋭减、直接影響價遠外債爫及各國賠欵、亦須向斯會愼重聲明、（四）我國必須提案制裁暴日、伸張公理、並且斯會討論主旨、在消弭世界經濟恐慌、欲達此目的、必先討論安定世界政局、俾各國人民均得安居樂業、故斯會對遠東政局問題、亦必須尋求光明途徑、始能完成如集之使命、按以上四點、係就主要方面言之、惟斯會討論範圍猶未詳確規定、故提案之凖備、祇能先定原則、至具體辦法、當由出席代表隨機策應之、（十六日專電）中央召各地黨委到京諮詢黨務　　（南京）中央如各省市黨委來京、諮詢各省市最近黨務情形、並將今後黨務方針、有所指示、已抵京者、有張華村·蕭聞叔等、其餘卾·赣·皖等地黨委、今明均可抵京、（十六日專電）（南京）張華村十六由濟抵京、向中央報告魯省黨務情形、（十六日尃電）高友唐等彈劾劾王正廷案　　（南京）監委高友唐等以前外長王正廷喪權辱國、斷送南洋各地黨權、曾提出彈劾、並經行政院一度派員調查、尚無結果、現有改派專属查辦説、（十六日專電）魯南股匪逞兇縱火燒蔣莊焚斃多人　　（徐州）路訊、魯南股匪佔踞韓莊東北十五里之大小官莊舉、縣長率隧往勦、與匪激戰、匪麰樅火燒莊、焚斃人民甚多、匪被燒死二十餘、殘部潰竄、（十六日專電）龍雲派員到京　　（南京）漢主席能雲爲明瞭日軍遒冦及華北抗日實况、派參議　華旅長谷晨漙溥魯子泉等十人北來、調查接洽、於十六日抵京、即往軍委會晋見朱培徳、定今明日日赴贑謁蔣陳遠、並請示一切、再定北上考察之途程、（十六日專電）　　（南京）雲南考察團某團員云、能雲已準備出兵一師作抗日前驅、如中央有令、即随時出發、（十六日專電）沈鴻烈到濟偕邵元冲返靑　　（濟南）今日沈鴻烈·葛光庭·來淸、復榘到站迎、沈談、沿海平静、靑島駐日驅逐艦二隻、烟台龍口大沽均無日艦、秦皇島日艦二大二小、餘均在旅順、總數仍十一隻、此來爲與韓主席商救濟本省出口業、因本省惟一出口貨花生米花生油、均因歐銷港銷俱斷、靑島存米五百萬噸、油二百萬噸、現擬减碼頭捐檢騐費運費、前與韓主席會請財部酌减關税、以資維持、本省牛以前靑島每日出口三千頭、現只四五百頭、雉子出口斷絕、煤前每月出口五萬噸、現只三萬餘噸、係受撫順煤傾銷影響、葛談、膠路决加開四等貧民車、减票價一半、（十六日專電）　　（濟南）今邵元冲·趙丕廉·到淸、下車即赴共和醫院看劉守中病（十六日專電）　　（濟南）韓今日與葛光庭沈鴻烈赴國書館參觀滕縣古物、（十六日專電）　　（濟南）邵元冲談、定今晚偕沈葛赴靑島視察政治黨務地方情形後、再返濟視察、由濟赴平、趙丕廉談、如劉守中病愈、即偕劉赴膠東視察、否則余先回京、晚十點沈邵葛同赴靑、韓到站送行、（十六日專電）漢口日僑大批婦孺歸國鬈長江日輪客貨均淡　　（漢口）漢日僑婦孺最近返國者二百餘人、日租界商業益益冷淡、商輪行駛滬漢僅襄陽·洛陽·鳳陽·南陽四輪、鎭京蕪潯各埠、均無貨物起御、十六襄陽輪入口、只装啤酒六件、載客亦僅少数白俄、華人巳絕跡、（十六日專電）　　（漢口）漢日僑十六晨九時、在明洽小學開東北陣亡將士招魂祭禮大會、由石川勝敏主祭、到會二百餘人、又日艦宇治十六開宜昌、（十六日專電）馮玉祥代表分谒粤桂將領李宗仁病愈出院　　（香港）馮玉祥代表熊觀民·于爕成十日抵粤、謁陳濟棠·李宗仁、定日内赴桂谒白崇禧、（十六日專電）　　（香港）李宗仁病愈出院、十六日訪陳濟棠·蔡廷鍇、（十六日專電）　　（香港）粤再電中央、增撥入贛剿匪軍費、（十六日專電）（香港）粤允助宋商兩軍費各五千元、（十六日專電）張繼昨過徐赴新鄕　　（徐州）張繼十六日由京過徐赴新鄕、據談、華北辦事處爲辦事便利計、將移保定、伹須候中央决定、此後在華北薰務工作、應注重鄕鄕村、俾三民主義深入民間、（十六日專電）京市捕盗殞命兩警柩暫厝烈士祠　　（南京）因追捕搶刦王榮江營營造廠盗匪被匪開槍謦警之警士曹德山·王文玉·巳於十六日由警應備棺收殮、送至第一公園烈士祠暫厝、定期開追悼會、並將厚部其家属、至此次奮勇捕盗之各將、亦將分别獎勵、受傷之警士呂萬海、已由中央醫院將彈取出、脈搏熟度均未增髙、生命可望無虞、（十六日專電）中國土地學會成立　　（南京）中國土地學會、十六日成立、票選覃振·邵力子·等十一人爲理事、（十六日專電）實部設法救濟國煤　　（南京）實部爲救濟國煤、除商得晨部同意减輕煤斤運價外、並電煤業各團體、轉知煤商、再减成本、以期傾銷、（十六日專電）立法院推員起草國民大會法案　　（南京）立法院推張知本等七人起草國民大會組織法選舉法、定本星期内集羲一次、即開始起草、（十六日專電）比使離京赴平就任　　（南京）比使紀佑穆十六晚赴平就任、（十六日專電）美日飛機速度比較（南京）歐戰後世界飛機製造技術日精、其馬力在千五百四以上者、英有十六種、法有兩種、徳五種、意十種、美六種、日本二種、其中以美國之（一）巴熟里（二）賀卡（三）基斯統三種飛機速度最大、每小時可行二四零公里以上、次則爲日本之（九二式）飛機、每小時可行二三零公里、（十六日中央社電）顔德慶扄啓程返國　　（南京）鉽部技監颜德慶、去歲赴日内瓦任國聯代表團專員、兹以事畢、十四日啓程轉馬賽返國、五月中旬可抵滬、（十六日中央社電）交部飭屬趕造决算　　（南京）交通部以部轄直屬各機關决算、原應三月底呈部、刻已逾限多日、今特嚴電催促漏夜趕造呈報、（十五日中央社電）威廉定期在京演講　　（南京）威廉馬丹定二十二晚在金陵大學禮堂演説中國外交政策之難題及制裁暴日問題、（十六日專電）軍部派員出洋習醫　　　（南京）軍政部派第九陸軍醫院院長吴哲孫往德國·丹麥·荷蘭·瑞典·捷克·等國考察軍醫、（十六日專電）笨賊偷屋　　（哈爾滨）俄婦史加培爾基那夫人、報告警署、謂渠在哈爾鄉間有屋一所、不知爲睢何將該屋拆毀、盡載其材料而去、盗等手段甚爲敏捷、因先一日該婦猶往該屋、見一切完好、迨翌日復往、該屋已不翼而飛、片瓦無存矣、警察後查明有二華人五俄人於前一日正午驅車五輛彰往拆屋、嗣將所有材籿以車載去、不知何往、何物不可盗、而竟盗屋屋、該盗亦可謂笨伯矣、（十六日路透電）</p>

<p>今天、敞部舉行全國鐵路沿線出産貨品展覧會講演會、敞部貨展的意義和大槪情形、已屢次在報上披蕗、諸君想已經明瞭、全國鐵路唯一的主顧、就是各行同業、各行同業每年委託鐵路運的貨物、數目非常之多、就民國二十年的统計來説、全國全年運輸的噸位、一共兩千多萬噸、所有運費、共計有七千二百多萬元、以怎麽大的生意、來委旗我們鐵路、信任我們鐵路、鐵路負這樣大的責任、這種責任、就是把各商行的貨物、送到目的地、這種責任、在鐵路上雖然是時間很短、但是已往、我們鐵路人員的辦事能力、還是非常幼稚、有很多地方、我們覺得非常慚愧、我們可以説是還未有盡我們鐵路的責任、因爲鐵路的責任、不袛運輪而已、還要推進鐵路沿線的農工商各業增加生産的能力、促進他的發達、這種才是鐵路眞正的目的、所以建築鐵路、本來是爲全國各業的發展、我們要達到這個目的、應該使全國人民、得到種種便利、因爲如此、所以敞部此次將全國鐵路沿線出産貨樣、拿到上海來、舉行第一次全國鐵路沿線出産貨品展覧會、雖然、這一次的貨樣、並不多、但是全國鐵道三十年來所未有辦的、現在算是辯了、我們也已經盡量想法了、將各地的出産、收集弄來、盡量的調查各種貨物的産銷運之方面、希望上海各商行、能夠详細的研究、能夠指遵各地方出産的能力、運輪的方法、銷費的能力、把各種貨樣、詳細比較、這樣就可以定各商行今後營業的方針、這是鐵路沿線貨</p>
<p>展最重要的綠因、鐵路沿線、最重要出産有兩種、第一種是　産、根擔民二十年的统計、全國　産的噸位、有一千三百多萬、所有的運費是兩千五百多萬、第二種是農産、就是糧食一類的東西、根擔民二十年统計、噸位有三百四十多萬噸、運費兩千多萬元、這兩個是鐵路最有的主　、其次是工業品、民二十年有三百多萬噸、運費一千九百多萬元、其他的貨物、數目很少、不過這三種重要的貨物、在鐵路方面看起來、還是非常幼稚的時期、需要充分的改良、努力的推進、因爲各地方的交通很不便利、其他種種、都感覺非常困雖、所以一般商人、未有法子到各處去調查、有很我國産的貨品、我們竟末有法子可以知道、今天趁這個機會、大家可以詳細的參考、至於與上海商人有最密切的關係的、就是京　　杭甬兩路、我們看京滬路、民國二十年的統計、貨物的噸位、是一百多萬噸、運費一百八十多萬元、其中數目最大的、就是費産品、他的噸位、是四十六萬噸、運運是六十六萬元、次要的就是工業品、全年是三十八萬多噸、運費是七十七萬餘元、這種情形、與全國的統計、稍爲有點兩樣、因爲上海是工業品非常發達的地方、所以比较旁的路所估的成分、稍爲多一點、其他的林鑛等産品、估很少的數目、滬杭甬路、全年的貨運噸位、八十多萬噸、運費一百四十幾萬元、這襄面最在的、是工業品、他的噸位是三十萬二十二萬噸、運費有十萬元、其他都是很少的數目、　部對於兩路、正在　眞整理之中、現在黄局長·吳副局長·正在努力澈底的改善、希望能　　到諸位所期望的、至我們所希望於諸君的、第一、就是辦鐵路在表面上算是國營的事業、然而不應該有一種普通衙門官僚的習氣、來影響我們業務的前進、也許我們鐵路同人裏面、難免有這種不良份子、我們希望諸位盡量的監督、因爲鐵　路當是商業化、各商行不要困爲他是衙門、如果諸位　破了這一點、那末以後各商行與我們的關係、就等於商人與商人之間的營　一樣、我們有不對的地方、諸君就可以拿對付同行的態度、來對付我們、責備我們、使我們馬上改正、那末、鐵路的當業、就有辦法、各商行自身的營業、也有辦法、我也知道、從前鐵路種種腐敗</p>
<p>的地方、比方車皮費·掛　費·加油費·與其他種種弊端、不但是鐵路員司的舞弊、其中還有不肖的商人在裏面勾結、因爲他們袛貪目前的利益、也有種種寭劣的　境所逼迫、因此在規定的運費之外、另外加上了一倍或一倍以上之運費、在諸君因爲營業的關係、不能不忍痛的忍受、然而這多出的　、在鐵路本身、並未有受到好處、而在諸君增加了許多負　、這個可以説、鐵路没有盡鐵路的責任、也可以説諸君未有盡監督的責任、敝部很願意請諸君努力監督、使鐵路與客商、能够共同合作、（二）我們也希望位認識鐵路、現在敝部對於以前鐵路的情形、有根本改革的地方、鐵路對於貨物、向來是不負責任的、你們願总來就來、不願意來、我們也不管、我們運貨、丢了壤了少了偷了、都可以不、這種情形、在世界各匣鐵路上看起來、都没有的、可以説是中國鐵路最大的毛病、所以敝部去年提倡負責運輸、負責運輸、就是爲各商行誠意的服務、也許有人以爲我們辦負責運輸、是要加一成運費、其實這是根本誤會的、因爲以前客商所交的運費、往往超過規定有一倍或者兩倍的數目、現在所加的一成、可以説是很少、而客商可以免去這一倍兩倍的負擔、我們鐵路、是爲公衆謀幸褔、並不是爲賺錢的、雖然、我們並不希望虧本、但是有虧本的地方、我們也要辦、諸君要知道、我們負責運輸、就是要客商直接到鐵路來運貨、少經過幾個經手人、那末客商的負擔、當然可以减經許多負擔、所以請諸位認清這一點、（三）鐵路雖然是國營的機關、然而他的目的、是要發展人民的生産能力、增加農工商業生産的量、改良以往幼稚的情形、推進工業農業商業協助他使他發達、　如说敝部這一年來、對於一　的收費、本來是頭等加四倍、以後改爲二等加四倍、現在把四倍取消、祗收二等運費了、其他的如陶器·窑貨·粗糧食·監·農産種子·鮮桑菜·亁鮮　·　子·各種植物·金　砂石·均减一等或二等、國産火柴成品减四等、塘沽永利製鹹六等七五折、華資工廠出品原料·山東製針廠·上海天原電化廠减一等、上海申新·永安紡織·九江久興紡織·棉秒布匹、均已减等、煤斤糧食茶菜羊毛磁　粗紙訂定等價、總之、我們以適合各業的需要爲標凖、盡量设法、協助生産力量的増加、（四）鄙人很希望今天能夠促成鐵路與商人的合作、所以我們鐵路、舉行這個展覧覧會、使全國的貨樣、集合在一起、使大家詳細的參考、這一個展覧會、就是路商合作的起點、我們鐵路、還有很多應當改良的地方、请各位不吝指敎、使我們能够减少各商行的負擔、也就是盡我們鐵路一部份的責任、以下请譚帮辦講鐵路運貨農工商各界須知的手續、</p>

<p>昨有大批仇魚進口卒因未能消售退回</p>
<p>申時電訊社本埠消息、我國漁業　極幼穉、近數年來、雖稍見改進、惟因迫於經濟、難期擴充、坐見强鄰侵略、無法抗爭、最近市上更有一種駭人聽聞之谈、謂仇魚商團、復以種種方法、陰　搗亂我上海魚市、中時社記者、欲明暸其究竟、及本市魚業近况起見、特赴有關係各方詳密採訪、茲將所得結果、分誌於后、</p>
<h3 id="c79">現有漁輪 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>我國現有漁輪、僅中華·聯豊·永豊·海順·永茂·茂豊·集美·海興·富達·富貴、（原名東泰丸、以一萬三千元向日本購來、）褐生一·二·號、（原名晩洋丸、以二萬元向日本購來、）民生一·二·號等十一輪、除集美·海興·二輪、租與江蘇省立漁業試騐場、民生輪爲浙江省立水産學校所有外、餘均爲捕捉魚類之各漁及漁業公司所有、其中集美輪創立最早、富達富貴輪最遲、總計資本爲六十六萬八千元</p>
<h3 id="c80">捕捉近况 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>目下捕捉之主要魚類、爲黄花魚（俗名小黄魚、）鐔魚·鞋底魚·蓋上三種魚類、除黄花魚爲時鮮貨外、鐔魚及鞋底魚、則爲常年貨、每輪出口、少則七八日、多則十三四日、即可進口、所獲魚量、少則百餘箱、或二三百箱、多則七八百箱、民船以土祘捕捉、則無一定日期、故難於統計、蓋民船須預先抛錨張綢、待魚類自行投入、不若漁輪之能自由　捕、</p>
<h3 id="c81">仇我分别 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>我國自被日　無故侵略以後、國民有自動抵制仇魚之舉、惟有一小部之奸商、不知利害、徒顧目前之小利、惟魚類不若布匹或什物之有固定商標、魚則頗難於鋻别、况仇輪更時至我領海盗捕、更以捕得之魚、售諸我國市塲、是則來源如一、更難識别、然置魚之裝載物、尚可約略分别、如寗波貨以木桶裝載、每桶可四百斤左右、本埠則以竹蔀、每蔀可納百餘斤、大連來者、則爲大木箱或大圓木桶、每件可裝二百餘斤至三百餘斤、仇貨則爲小木板箱、每箱僅四十斤、箱中之魚、先以水冲洗後、方行裝入、且箱面之冰塊、下承以紙、使汚泥不至汚及魚身、故魚身均較華魚華魚爲清　、內行者見之立可分辦清楚、流綢船（即民船）則散置船中、每船所置魚量、少則百餘担、多亦不過七八百担、</p>
<h3 id="c82">無恥奸商 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>記者曾至上海漁業仇貨檢查會、詢問最近檢查仇貨情形、據委員毛菊生君、謂魚商大多頗知自愛、自暴日侵入我國後、各魚行相率不爲代賣、惟有一小部分不顧大局之無恥好商、以貧得目前之些微利益、竞改頭換　、代爲銷售、但魚業問　於各貨來　、即極少數亦無不明暸者、如本月十日愼豊協豊·同興·等經售之仇魚八百箱、即以板箱改裝筒部混售者、後爲同業識破、煞心者流、即以火油（即煤油）向仇魚澆潑、其下　着油不多者、大部分爲一謀客講去、小部份仍售於本垖、昨日又有日漁輪大成丸豊魚丸裝來大批仇魚九百六十箱、惟未能銷售、即行退出、其退出之故有二、（一）民衆反對極烈、仍恐師對待協豊愼豊等故　、而澆射煤油、（二）税額高大不合算、因目前黄花魚價、最低者不過六元左右、且不易售脱、故即時退去也、</p>
<h3 id="c83">傳有毒質 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>記者更詢毛君、謂近日外間頗爲有一種傳聞、凡進口之仇貨小黄魚、間有施以毒質者、不知才食之移時即發生腹痛如絞之症、未悉果有此事否、毛君答稱、謂此事尚未有所聞、惟此種謡言就爲無因、茲不問仇魚之有無毒質、我真正之華魚、必將受影響無疑、蓋食户恐染毒質、遂生工戒心、相率不食、　有一　可以　所表自協豊　愼豊　　潮發生後、同業實不敢輕冒大不　而出於　試云</p>
<h3 id="c84">最近銷價 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>又據毛君　、今歳黄花魚出</p>
<p>産頗旺、敢售價便宜、最好者不過售九元左右、低者僅　六元之　、不若去年能至二十餘元、且各貨銷路、黄花魚大部銷於本埠、　帮則育京滬路之蘇·錫·常·鎮·滬杭路松·嘉·杭·各埠、鐔魚則傾銷寗波　化、本埠銷售亦多、惟不若寗奉之旺、鞋底魚則大部銷於番菜帮、即我輩所食之炸板魚是　、</p>
<h3 id="c85">前途危機 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>據記者近日　查昕得、除仇商除謀誛　　海之魚外、復有　種之具　計劃、以謀破壤我沿海之魚市證之最近市面　言、益覺可靠、國人對於商業競爭、素多膜視、且各自爲謀、不能一致團結、尤足爲仇商造機會、彼則爲大規模之計劃、一旦任其實現、則我魚市能不爲所奪者亦僅矣、深望我漁業團體、急起圖之、</p>

<p>（十）本埠劉思民君來信　爲農村問题</p>
<p>再質尤懹臯先生並朱天靑行生</p>
<p>我們爲了尤先生對於「農邨回得去嗎？」這一問題。發表了他的「洞達大勢。眼光深遠極了」的偉論。發表黩意見。如張梅君。如石愚君。如我皆是反對尤先生的高見的。張石一先生反對尤先生的出發點。雖然和我有些不同。然而他們的意見我都是贊成的。我提出了許多問题。質問尤先生。正在這裏渴望著尤先生的答復。今天讀到申報讀者顧問的朱天靑先生的信。曉得朱先生是同情於尤先生的。好極好極。一來，我們雖遠没有得到尤先生的回答。然而同情於尤先生的回答。當然是一樣的。二來，尤先生的高見。也找到了回聲。大家討論起來。分外有趣。這一問題。絶不是我們幾個人的問題。而是當前一個極關重要的問題。因爲二方面的立塲不同。這種立塲的背後。便隐藏着社會衝突之極尖端的關係。現在我且就先生我來信商榷商榷。</p>
<p>（一）尤先生一點也不「洞達大勢。」一點也没有「深遠」「眼光。」尤先生的意思是説。（當然朱先生也是這樣説。）中國農民的痛苦。最重要的是由於他們没有知識。他們的没知識。是「由於農村敎育不發達。」所以要勸人到鄉村辦敎育。那末。我要請問。中國的鄉村敎育爲什麽不發達呢。尤先生和朱先生能給我們一個答復麽。我想你們的答復（要是從足下稱贊尤先生「洞達大勢眼光深遠極了」的話推論下去。）一定是。因爲没有人「洞達在勢。」没有人有「深遠」的「眼光。」所以鄉村敎育没有人辦。或是有人辦也辦不好。問題有這樣簡單麽。這不是在玄學鬼的迷塊陣中兜圈子麽。或則尤朱兩先生的答復比這高明一點。答這。中國農村敎育不發達。是由於軍閥内戰。苛捐雜税等。或如朱先生说的「農村的破産。情形龐雜。牠們各有背景。晵如中國農村的破産。由於内亂。共匪到處　亂。」阿！阿。這想必就是「深遠的眼光」了。那末。我　要綪　。「内亂」是從什麽地方來的呢。天上掉下來的嗎。「共匪」又從什麽地方來的呢。地裏生出來的嗎。一個人對於社會現象。若果只看到牠的表面。那你的判斷就永遠不會給人满意的答復。也就永遠不會給人解决問題。因爲你只在表面上。形式上着眼。怎樣會洞達大勢呢。眼光又怎樣會深遠呢。而且我遠要請敎。所謂「農村破産。情形龐雜」究意是怎樣龐雜法子。所謂「各有背景。」究竟是怎樣一種背景。譼如美國。假使一個自詡爲「洞達大勢眼光深遠」的人給人解决問題。僅以「情形龐雜各有背景」了之。那這種牛皮。我也會吹。不但我會吹。就是阿貓阿狗都會吹。先生。我們研究一個社會問題。尤其是一個極複雜的社會問題。首先的任務。就是要在牠纷紜錯雜。五光十色的現象中。找也牠的主要的動力。就是説。我們要分清什麽是這種現象的主要原因。什麽是牠的物質基礎。什麽是牠的上　建築。尤先生或朱先生若果不能回答我的上面的問題。最好遠是謂你閉口不説的好。（二）尤先生勸人到鄉村去。完全是個人主義的落伍思想。不但落伍　朱先生，我説這話你暫且不要氣。聽我道來。尤先生説。「久居城中的人。或要感到枯寂無聊的少趣。」這到是一句老實话。因爲大人老爺們。或是財東們在城中過厭了。坐着汽車。帶着摩登女郎。到到鄉下别墅去。閑散閑散開開心。這猶之乎大人老爺吃大菜。喝波蘭地。吃厭了。偶爾吃點蔬菜。喝點燒酒換換口。倒覺别致有趣。如果這樣。各行其是。我們没有什麽話説。然而尤先生的「但是」（這種上下不接氣的文字。本來就不通。然而我現在不是在敎學生。改文章。只好不説了）一轉。却説。「我覺得在國難臨頭時節。眼見着都市中醉生夢死的生活。」我當時讀到這兒。心頭狂喜。以爲尤先生一定會給我們想個方法。來挽救「國難。」來　改這「都市中醉生夢死的生活」狀態。他却勸我們「逃之夭夭。」一溜烟跑到鄉村。並且遠要「覓一個幽靜可愛的鄉村。去另謀出路。」這裏已經充分地表現尤先生根本矛盾。旣是説是國難臨頭。就應該先應付了國難。譬如如敵人的刀　着我們的頭是了。我們只有先排除了這「臨頭」的大難。才説其牠。那有「憑我能力所及。用十年的工夫。來建设一個意想中的新式的桃化源」的餘閑給你。這不是自相矛盾麽。其實是我們把尤先生的「國難臨頭」道幾個字看得太重了。在尤先生寫到這幾個字的時候。也不過等於上海報上各商店裏大登廣吿。什麽「國難臨頭。要買國貨。」或「挽救國難。唯有穿國貨中山裝」一樣的心理。但是我們所以要嘮叨的。不是爲的尤先生。而是恐他害人了。尤先生的眼睛根本就没有看覎下層　衆。並且也根本不願接近下層　衆。所以他勸雄聲先生「覓一個幽靜的鄉邨。」若果要眞正地到　村去。爲的是大多數的農民。那就不能愛「幽」。不能喜「靜。那就要習慣了農民的啶詳嘮叨。和他們平坐平吃。給他們解决痛苦。跑到他們齷齪不堪啼飢號寒的農村去。一黠他不能麻煩。天下有幾個愛「幽」喜「靜」的高人　士。能做得這種事業。若果眞要「幽」要「靜」那只有在鄉村的風景幽勝的地方建立一個修道院。在那兒去做衣　。接迎上帝。有時也可以給農民看看病。説説敎。可以找些「信徒。」更談不談國難不國難。恰恰相反。張學良　一年有半送掉中國四省土地。現在仍在交戰。若果有點心肝的人。都應當積極地先在都市中鼓動起抗日的情緒。組織起來。然後從城市推到鄉村。組織民衆抗日救國軍與救國關體。敎農民知道我們只有拿起武器來先把「臨頭」的「國難。」卽侵人腹地的敵「人」驅逐出去。方來談别的。等不到你來慢慢地談學校。講詩云了曰。更等不到你「十年的工夫。來建設一個意想中的新式桃花源。」报以我説。尤先生的説話是站在我們的營壘中替敵人做反宣傳。至少是無意識地替敵人做反宣傳。（三）尤先生祇有看到樹没有看到森林。尤先生只知道勸人到鄉村去。並且是到「幽靜的鄉村」去做「新式的」隐君子。（有尤先生的「新式桃花源。」自然有這種「新式的」隐君子。當然這種「新式的」隐君子。不和蕉式的「踏雪尋梅。」「飲酒賞菊」的隐君子一樣。他們「是穿中同裝。」「會説洋話」（至少懂得ＡＢＣ。）脚登革履。眼架托里克。口喊着「國難臨頭」的新式的隐君子。）這樣絶談不到鄉村的一般的敎育。卽使承認他。這種辦法是在辦農村敎育。也是驢唇不對馬嘴。他以「中國的大敵。」不單單是「日本帝國主義。」而尤在農民之「一代一代的無敎育。」他不知道農民一代一代的無敎育的原因。（經濟的與政治的。）所以只有這樣的「頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚」的辦法。我十二日在申報上發表質問尤先生的信所提出的政治問題。並不是怕有政治干涉或受到政治影響。而是看到尤先生是閉着眼睛不看政治。閉口不説政治。閉着腦筋不想政治。到今天看見了朱先生的大論。我才恍然大悟。尤先生的「要建設新式的桃花源的出發點。」出發點怎樣建設。我今天是第一次的眼福。）就是「要使人民洞達國家大事。」這話怎講。我真蠢。一點也不懂。「建設新式桃花源」與「使人民知道國家大事」結起婚來。真是聞所未聞。有了。有了。建設「新式桃花源」的出發點。就是想開拓農村敎育。所以要開拓農村的敎育。就是要使人民洞達國家大事爲最高目的。所謂「要使人民洞達國家大事爲最高目的」這又把我弄糊途了。就文法解剖起來。「人民洞達國家大事」是賓洞。要使爲「動詞。」若果這樣，那這句話就不通。那就應該改爲「以使人民洞達國家大事爲最高目的。」而「爲最高目的」是开容「以使人民洞達國家大事」的开容勛詞的短句子。不然便應當這樣地角释。要使人洞達國家大事爲最高目的。」就是说要敎人民知道國家大事是我們最高的目的。然而這與上下文又不接氣。也是不通。究竟怎樣呢。我想。朱先生若是這樣説。「所以要開拓農村敎育。其最高的目的就是要使人民洞達國家大事」便通了。我不是故意在咬文嚼字。而是因爲尤先生注意到鄉村去的「識字能文」的「領袖人物。」若果旘字而文不通。豈不是失却「領袖人物」的奞格嗎。朱先生又要説。「可謂滑稽之至」了。現在姑且承認就是這末説吧。我且請問「國家大事」是怎樣會知道呢。你要研究外國文罷。你需要電報。（尤先生遠要收音機呢。）你需要洞達世界大勢明歷史地理吧。你要改良種子。改進種植與收割的機械吧。這些東西都是由城市裏來的。並且在一定的條件之下。（没有軍閵的混戰。没有封建的剝削。没有貧官汚吏的摧殘。政治的清明要在水平線上。）方可以得到。才有使人民（尤先生的眼中的人民自然是農民自然是富農）曉得國家大事的可能。不然的話。一部馬氏文通便會請你當饖　風味。又怎樣能容你「使人民洞達國家大事」呢。而且朱先生所謂「洞遠」兩字實在太言重了。人民都能洞達國家大事固然是我們所想望的。然而所謂國家大事就是些什麽事呢。恐怕是左一個「新式桃花源」右一個「新式桃花源」吧。尤朱兩先生自已對於國家大事遠没有「達。」更談不到「洞。」怎樣使農民去「洞達」呢。我告訴你。從前北京城城裏的館予裏或客棧裏都貼「休談國事」四個大字。那你們的「新式桃花源」的氏敎育農民的綱領第一條而且唯一的一條。就是「休談國事。」不但休談國家大事。並且休談國家小事。這才合乎你們的宗旨。你們也只有這樣。因爲你們只是自欺欺人。你們的眼睛始終没有看到城市鄉村的最大多數的民衆（工人貧民和店員。）没有看到政治。（實在是不敢談政治。美國日本的農村破産是否比中國厲害。這要拿土地關係。與農民的整個生活及其他們的文化程度來决定的。我們並不會單論過這個問题。然而我們可以説中國農民若是發達到了美國的資本生義大規模的農業的生活狀態。他們的破産程度一定同美國差不多。或則更要厲害。（其實在現在的政治狀况之下。中國的民族資本决没有能力與勇氣能以直接走上這條路。因爲要走上這二條路。必需有二個條件。對外排除帝國主義的壓迫與剝削。對内實行真正的民主政治。解决土地問題。不然。便没有希望。這是現在「國家大事」的ＡＢＣ。）若是美國的農民處到中國農民現在的狀况。其　攘不寗更是不可一朝居。因爲他們的文化水準因了經濟的水準而增高。自然更不能和平地忍受這種痛苦。你們閉着睛睛不看整個社會的真象。實在遠談到什麽「國事」不國事。至於你的第（四）條所説的話是無的放矢。請看我的原函是怎樣説的。若果你的「須知天下的事决無絶對的」話是真理。那是對尤先生的批評。與我不相干。</p>

<p>莊子曰，「哀莫大於心死、而身死次之」。次之者，兩害到其輕也。所以，外面的身體要牠死，而内心要牠洛：或者正因爲要那心活，所以把身體治死。此之謂治心。</p>

<p>治心的道理很玄妙：心固然要活，但不可遇於活。　　心死了，就明明白白地不抵抗，結果反而弄得大家不鎭靜。心過於活了。就胡思亂想，當眞要閙抵抗；這種人，「絶對不能言抗日」</p>

<p>— 待桁</p>
<p>最厅怪的是沈中元之之死。這個沈中元外號人稱小諸葛，也是書中最主要的人物之一。在「坧俠五義」的書名改爲「七俠五義」的時候·作者在序上特意講了他·封他爲俠客之一。而且在卷六第一百回書中，作者還鄭重地替他解釋着説：　　「凡俠客義士行止不同。若是沈中元尤難。自已先　個從奸助惡之名，而且在奸王面前，還要隨聲附和，迎逢獻媚，屈已從人，何以見他的俠義呢？殊不知他仗着自已聰明智略過人，他把事體看透，猶如掌上觀文，彷彿逢場作戲，從游戲中生出俠義來，這才是眞正俠義。即如南俠北俠雙俠甚至小俠，處處濟困扶危，誰不知是行俠尚義呢？這明是露的俠義，却到容易。若沈中元决非他等可比，他却在暗中調停，毫不露一點聲色，隨機應變，譎詐多端，到了歸期，恰在俠義之中，豈不是個極難事呢」　　這樣「三俠五義」的作者稱讚了的俠客，到了「續小五義」的作者的手裏，却不免一死了。也許「三俠五義」的作者與「續小五義」的作者的思想，起了不詷合了吧。由前者看來，沈中元一向作的裏應外合的色當，是仍不失爲俠義的，而且是一件極難的事，可是由後者看來，沈中元的一向的行爲，是不合道德的，應當給他一個報應。</p>
<p>在「續小五義」裏，本來提到沈中元的地方就極少，而在書已講到收尾，萬歲爺都已快到降旨封官的時候，更無需筆下不留情，將這個經了千辛萬苦的俠客致諸死地。但是那作者早就對於前肅作者的不公平，懷下反抗心了，所以無論如何，也把他硬拉了來，使他遭到横死。他怎樣叙述的呢？那是很簡的描寫。</p>
<p>「姚文奔到用棍對北俠就打，北俠用平生之力對姚文横着磕，姚文　受不住，先撤一隻手，那隻手也拿不住了，横着丢將出去多遠。不料沈中元往前一跑，那棍正打在沈中元太陽穴上，沈中元鳴呼哀哉歸陰去了。皆因這人反覆無常，心地不正，故此他先死了。」　　「續小五義」的作者以「反覆無常，心地不正」八個字的罪名，就致沈中元於死地，我眞替地呌寃。其實是因爲「續小五義」的作者與前作者的道德觀念不同，而阜就懹下了反抗心，就替他揑造了這樣的罪名。</p>

<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>小時候讀古文觀止，讀得每篇爛熟；老師説要讀熟　好，因爲古語道，『熟讀唐詩三百首，不會做詩也會吟』：所以我們就『摇頭擺耳』，讀得爛熟。大家以爲『熟讀古文書一部，不會做文也會抄』：那時候老師説我們這幾個孩子是『孺子可敎』的。果然，文章讀熟，文境自來：老師一有課題，我們總能夠『像煞有介事』地，寫那麽一大篇；而且頗有些『古香古色』。古文觀止裏的每篇文章，又幾乎成爲一種文譜；我們做起文章來，就照譜塡字；要不是仿五柳先生傳，便是仿醉翁亭記。那時候老師又説我們『可與道古』。於是乎我們讀文章的興趣更好了。　　其實，常時以古文觀止作爲文譜者，當亦不止我們幾個『乳臭未乾』的黄毛小子。還有許多文人，特地编了雜誌來寫那種文章。於是乎有仿秋聲賦而做的尿聲賦，有仿阿房宮赋而做的澡堂赋等等，一時爭相傳誦，據説『紙貴洛陽』。直到今天，我還可以翻出幾册雜誌：仍然覺得這些文章的作者除了照例是『可與道古』外還多少有點幽默氣度。例如××雜誌第四期所登的一篇倣桃李園序的「專制國序」：</p>
<p>『夫國家者，一人之私産：人民者，君主之𨽻。而民心難服，爲時幾何？古王創立專制，良有以也。况聖賢敎我以妙策：牙爪假我以淫威。市爵賞之虚恩；賺愚臣之死力。焚書坑士，願爲始皇：暴歛横征，獨慚桀紂。壓制未足，殺　頻施。與三字之寃獄，快一黨之私仇。不如内亂何能滅亡。欲哭不能，爲之太息無數』。</p>
<p>這不是用來諷刺無論甚塺時代都很恰當的文字嗎？</p>

<p>是妻逝世的第三週月紀念。早起，天空灰暗，沉　。自已的心也一般的灰暗，沉　。</p>
<p>在異國的都會裏，幾年没有聽着的喚雨」的鳩聲，初聽到到時好像有着會見故人似的親切之感，但在今天，這樣固執地喚若，覺得非常討厭。吃過午飯，终於在輕風細雨中悄悄地坐上　閔長途汽車出發了。　　三個月來，隔不多天，又夾在一些小商人和小地主裏面，坐着長途汽車作來回兩小時的短旅行，已成了習慣。　　最初，每次出發時，總是在悲哀的重荷下，苦悶著，窒息着，再也不感覺别的；近來，漸渐不同了，大概是習慣了的綠故罷，每次出發時，在同樣凄楚的胸懷裏，却有着幾許欣喜的心情：這就如小時候在學常住讀，一到星期六便能回家去頑一兩天的那種心情一樣。　　三個月來，自已不是有了一個家在上海市外嗎？不是有了一個住着自已唯一的愛人的家在那幽靜的郊野嗎？</p>
<p>因爲有着這樣渴望回家的孩子侅似的欣喜，本來充满着悲苦的不吉的旅行，也就並不使人十分難堪了，車一開行，竟會泰然的回過頭來眺看窗外的景色。　　汽車走過斜土路和製造局路交义處的Ｐｌａｃｅ時，眞像見着伹丁神曲第一部裏的一幅最動人最可怕的手　　，恐怕和憎惡的念頭，雜然並起。外國的Ｐｌａｃｅ，是雕像，是噴水池，是小塊的草地點綴着悦人的花木，而這裏呢，却是一片爛泥，業集着三四尺高的弓形船蓬，許多　着褴褸的男女，匍匐着在這些船蓬裏竄進竄出。這和在汚沼中湌着的猪獧有什麽分别呢？經過非洲時，參觀過最卑下的黑人的住家，同樣三四尺高的茅栅，伹乾燥的𤍠帶土寺，究竟還不至於终日在爛泥裏面打滾的。二十世紀的今日，還有人過着這樣悽慘的生活，實在很難呌人相信。　　但這怕人的地獄寫眞，祗一瞥就過去了，兩分鐘後，汽車走出了襤樓和汚穢的都會。　　現在展開在眼前的，是一望無邊的，盛放的黄色菜花。兩三座低矮的農舍，一半埋在菜花底下，一半露出春雨迷濛的空中，就像幾小艇飄流在佈满着浮萍的湖面一樣。　　汽車接連轉了幾個湾，忽然發見龍華塔和土山　敎堂的兩座鐘樓，遙遙相對地顯現在兩邊窗外。（未完）</p>

<p>經秋英的介弨，他和姓諸的認識了。介在他們的中間，秋英的態度非常的得意，好像在表示好有絶大的力量，征服了這兩個男性。到後來，好對海泉説，她要和姓諸的出去一趟，煩海泉照顧一下房子。假如老曹回來了時，便告訴他，她等一會就會回來。又如果海泉要出去就請他把房門鎖好，錀匙交存下面的二房東手裏好了。　　聽見秋英要出去，海泉感着一個大大的失望。他原想等老曹回來了時，再請他俩吃一個便飯的。此刻看見她和姓諸的那樣的親密，知道他的計劃失敗了，神氣懶懶的説：「我也要出去看」個朋友。　　海泉想，要他一個人守在這個像有鬼氣的冷寂的房裏等他們，無論如何做不到。他又想，自已也不會這樣傻。　　「那眞對不住了。」　　秋英裝出十分對不住他的樣子，笑着向他説。但他只是苦笑了一下，似乎是表示放棄了好的神氣。　　這時候，因爲秋英要換穿衣裳，姓諸的抱着小孩子走到外面去了。　　「林先生，我一刻就回來的。望你早一點回來，我等着你啊！」　　她说了後，又努着她的變唇向他。他看見没有誰在周圜，便順勢著她，和她作了一回，熱烈的接吻。　　他跟着她俩走出來，在電車站邊分了手。他望着他俩很高興地上了電車後，覺得自已是給社會排除出來了的人，他感着一陣悲哀和孤寂。他想，在這樣的情景之下，也儘可以流眼淚了。他一個人在馬路傍站了一忽，半意識地向鶴子夫人住家的那條大街走來。他在途中看見了許多没有祖國的俄國男女在追逐低級的歡樂，也看見了許多不知忘國恨的安南巡捕在向着中國人揚武耀威的走過去，他們頭上戴的黑色的笠帽，看見也令人討厭。還有許多那阿四也混在這些亡國奴　中，嘰哇呱啦一走過去。他們一面磨拳擦掌，一面走路。他們的威風似乎也不弱於今天下午作示威游行的一　靑年。　　距鶴子夫人所住的弄堂不遠了。海泉不敢，也不便再走向前去。他只遠遠地眺望了一下，覺得那個弄常亦是非常可愛的。他後悔和秋英親吻親得過早了。　　「旣可以和秋英親吻，那末，對鶴子夫人更可以∶∶∶他想壯着瞻兒走回去看一下。他深信有鶴子夫人在那裏，决没有什麽困難題發生的。可是他心裏雖然這樣想，脚下仍然是趦趄不能前進。　　他在那地方徘徊了好一會，也暗暗地自已悲慯了一番。到後來，他想，儘立在這路口上等，也等不出什麽結果來。他决意離開那個地點了。但他還　躇了一忽，他希望能够看見鶴子夫人家中的用人，也可以打聽一下他們的情形。可是他再企望了一忽，仍不見那個娘姨出來。他只有自已暗馬一聲自已是個蠢才了。「非革命不可？像這樣冰冷的無聊的生活，自已再也不能過了。」</p>

<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第四章　　業務之情形</p>
<p>（乙）　新藥界的業務</p>
<p>配方商從前是一種利息很厚的營業，所以配方商昔日竭力連絡醫生，甚而至於允許醫生取一種回扣，而招攪生意，開始作俑者是某外國藥房，以後各家一致效尤，竟成爲風氣。並且彼此競爭，回扣數目有增加到藥價分之三十的，於是病家買一元的藥，就須化一元三角之多。近年以來這種公開之秘密，漸漸爲社會上一般人所揭發，而以此詬病新醫，故而上海市醫師公會，曾經嚴重討論了幾回，通告會員，主張竭力拒絶這種苞苴的行國實醫師等幾位，在「醫藥评論」等刋物裏面發表過，此篇也就不赘。其實廢除這種陋規，在醫師方面毫無　利上的損失，蓋回扣的收入自然以開方的多　爲消長，假如一個醫師業務蕭條，所開的處方當然不多，正項收入旣的受打撃，而欲靠此回扣作開銷，也就無濟於事的了。但海上頗有著名的名醫，利用他生涯垢發達，過意在處方上亂開貴重的原瓶新藥，增高藥方價目，以便多得回扣，並且喜歡每天開一張新藥方，使病家天天配藥藥，（有一位醫生曾經治一個心臟病，光用毛地黄製劑一味，換闰至三十一張方子之多，他雖然得了三十餘次的診金，並得了一筆很大的附加税，而病家订頭，却宛如開了一爿小藥房，平添了二三十個只服二三次的原瓶藥品。）這種舉動，實在使明眼人　冷學術上的身份實在也受很大的降落咧。　　配藥商方面，對於取消回扣，比較的　受困雜，有二種原因：第一點是同業中員：第二點是各家都不肯首先創作好榜樣，而冒一個放棄營業的危險。關於第一點其實母須過慮，因爲百分之二十的回扣，已經成了通例，旣稱通例，即不足以當竸爭之工具。第二點也只要配方業中相約在一個時期同時廢除，也就没有什麽處。然而我們中國的同業，從來没有一行　是個的，假如用約定時期的辦法，必然發生第二個小同行，竭力來做這招攪的色當，並且本國配藥商又怕幾家外國藥房去運動醫師，搶了生意去。即此小小一端，也可見得我國要整理一什事情，往往受外國人的牵制。所以要肅清這個弊，必三方面合力去做：（一）是醫師要保持自已的身份，勿再貪此非義之財；（寗可加诊金），（二）是社會上病家，須要認清題目，配方到中國店家去右以便宜，不要再含了拜外的心理，往外國藥房跑：（三）要新藥配方商，將營業眼光放遠大些，寗歸勝利。本人把這件事公開的在此發表，也就是要社會上病家明瞭此中癥結，以後可以得谦價的藥物。　　至於配方商近來眞正的利息，早已不如前幾年好了，因爲各國藥廠，上海傾銷的合製劑量天多似一天，醫家爲便利起見，往往在處方上開現成的合製劑，病家偏惑於「來路貨」的三字，也歡迎服此類藥品，而經銷此類藥品的洋行，都在上海另有市價，藥房配方，至多略加佣多利息，却不能過高其價。（上面所述回扣之秘密，也就因此易於揭破。）又因各藥房必須聘用正式藥劑師等人員，責任旣重，開支尤鉅，所以利息比了學徒制度的時代，反薄了，市上流行的外國所製丸散膏丹，自化學出品，以至配合装管·盛瓶·包裹·封籨·都要人工，而此項人工，自然自金本位計算，加上運水到華，重　關税入口，然後折合銀兩，由藥行而達藥房，由藥房而至病家，當然價格很高的了。假使醫界於可能範圍，多用原料，仍照较舊的格式處方，藥劑師審愼配合，功效也是一樣治病。醫界和藥界旣　了職，而配方只管加厚利息，那病家的　負，還比買「來路原藥」輕得多呢。</p>

<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>年來吾國中外貨充斥，利權外溢，殆已達到了極點，弄得全國民窮財盡的失業的徧地都是，强悍的挻而走險，這是什麽人造成的呢？不必説，領導的，至少要負一半的責任，這句話，誰都不能否認的吧。我們醫藥界，覺悟最遲，二十年前，可説應用和消耗，還全在外人之手。到了近年，國中新醫輩出，亦多知新藥品的需要，於是消最，遂日漸增加，舉二十八行省，又爲各國競逐醫藥用品之塲了。財政家，大唱其經濟自决説：醫學家，狂呼其藥品自給説；工業界，競相倣造；舊醫界，盛唱抵制，而一片提倡國貨之聲，常觸目驚心的現乎報紙，到處宣傳，出乎大人先生之口，動乎愛國志士之心，照這樣的國民覺悟和努力，宜有相當的効果和成績了。然而按之事實，大謬不然。考科學幼稚之國，一切自先當追隨先進，所以物質補充，抵制外貨，第一從仿造着手，可以説一句很明亮的话，照外國的原料，照外國的式樣，照外國的効用，照外國的宣傳，這並不是賈牌，是挽回利權，是抵制外貨，諸位請想想，世間爭　權利，是何等劇烈和慘酷的事。這時嫩芽初放的花苗，極易被狂風驟雨所摧折，維護而挨植的是誰呢，不消説，政府之外，還有什麽權力可以依頼？所以外國，都有内國讗標法，這商標註册的大目標，是爲保護内國出品，不是保護外國出品，尃在獎勵内國出品，不是奬勵外國出品，因此設置商標註册之始，尤其是外貨充斥的國家，註的目光，應灌註在何處，頭腦清明的政治家，不消説，自然都很明白。日本是最會摹仿人家的國家　　的工業和醫業品中·什麽不仿照外國的式樣？什麽不　用外國的名稱？什麽不模　外國的口氣？而國家並不説他冒牌，不但不説他冒牌，即有人家説他冒牌，他還盡力的替他辯護，解説他不同之點，而獎勵他的仿造。不信，我隨使可舉出幾個實例來，比方像我們醫用的Ｊｕｓｎｌｉｎ，大家晓得他是治糖尿病的新藥，日本仿造了，便　取各Ｊｕｖｅｌｉｎ然而並不因其名稱類音，而不許註册，不許發資。又像Ａｎｔｏｐｈｌｃｅｇｌｓｔｉｏｎ是安福消腫膏，世界各處通行，日本造了，取名ｌｌｎｓｂｉｎ，但是並不因其裝式相同，而不許註册，不許發賣，又像Ｓｔａｎｎｏｘｙｌ，是治　疽的錫製内服藥，日本仿造了，便取名Ｅｔａｉｎｏｘｙｌ，然而也並不因其類音同裝同效，而不許註册，不許發賣，此外等這一類的藥品·和器具的實例，不一而足。政府不但不加禁此，有時還補助他資本，呌他暢造，貼他損失。有時還陳列起來，替他宣傳，贊他功用，有時還聘了許多醫藥專家，替他證明，給他褒狀，並没有聽到説，因爲要過盧外貨的銷塲，保護外貨的發賣，而加以壓迫禁止。爲什麽呢，因爲他們商品競爭的主眼在國際，而不在國内，所以國家保護獎勵的目標，也在國際，而不在國内。再進一句説：國際競爭，主在爲我，國内競爭，一秉大公，故外發貨和國貨的註册保護，宜分開而不可混同。困其中意義，有似是而實相反對者，即國内之所以要商標註册，無非防國内同業的仿造歟冒牌，而妨礙創製專賣權，如其有同類出品，切望他不要雷同，而對於國外輪入品之仿造與冒牌，旨在抵制外品，挽回利權，所以仿造力，求其神似，并且愈神似，愈可達其仿造之目的。若爲顧全國際道義，和互利主義起見，不妨如以限止，但是於名稱，式樣，顔色，効用等點，有一不同，即不得嚴格的指爲冒牌，而吹求禁止，反爲外貨張目。尤其是科學幼稚，正在提倡的國家，這是受過完全敎育的國民，和賢明的執政當局，應當切心注意的一點。　　我自問是個醫，最痛心的，每天給病人服的，用的，塗抹的，注射的，和此外一切的一切醫藥材料，可以説，不是英品，便是德品；不是法産，便是美産；甚而至於瑞士荷蘭等的小國出品，也不少參雜其間，要代以國産，苦代無可代，草根樹皮，未經科學製煉過的，當然不合我用，那末目下仿造製煉，無異急如薪火，一方藥業工業界，當然要十分努力，工方政府主管機關，更要十分獎護，大家都要放些天良，通力合作，那未才可達到救國自救的目的，切不可糊裏糊塗，忘了自已國家，忘了自已地们，忘了自已本分，忘了自已責任，在中間顛顛倒倒，使市塲上的外貨，只見其多；不見其少，那末除了因噎廢食而外，終於貧　弱　亡　絶了！</p>

<p>其三曰溢飲。溢飲之候曰。「飲水流行。歸於四肢。當汗出而不汗出。身體疼重。謂之溢飮。」又曰。「病溢飲者。當發其汗。」病源論溢飲之候則曰。「因大渴而暴飲水。水氣溢於腸胃之外。在於皮　之間。故言溢飲。令人身體疼重而多汗。」其所述病候。與金匱不同者有兩點。一。金匱言水歸四肢。病原言水在皮　。二。金匱言不汗。病源言多汗也。及觀千金曰。「病人　息上引。此皆有溢飮在胸中。久者。缺盆满。馬刀腫。有劇時，」云云。然後知金匱之但言四肢。乃其略而不詳之處。病源謂在皮　之間。足以補金匱之缺矣。蓋溢飮者。皮　有水腫之候。皮　水腫。全身到處皆可發生。不限於四肢。故缺盆陷下之處爲之满。而馬刀幽　之處爲</p>

<p>之腫也。請更以内經證之。素問脈要精　論曰。「其耎而散。色澤者。當病溢飮。溢飮者。渴暴多飮。而易入肌皮腸胃之外也，」楊上善注。以色澤光澤。王啓玄注。以爲面色浮澤。要皆淨腫之候也。張　庵注。引金匱水氣病篇「夫病水人面目鮮澤」之言。以證溢飮之色澤。由此言之。内經亦言溢飮爲水在肌皮。而肌皮之色。因水腫而光澤矣。據此。則溢飮之爲皮　水腫。更可以無疑矣。且千金大五飲丸。又謂溢飮之水。在隔上五藏間。是不但全身肌　之間有水腫。并内藏亦以爲有水腫矣。金匱獨言四肢者。將必水腫之候。四肢最先發生。而亦四肢最明著歟。若然。則溢飮者。乃心藏病之有循環障礙者也。故千金有肩息上引之候。謂呼吸促迫也。呼吸促迫。亦心藏病候之一矣。至不汗多汗之不同。或一言誗病之初。一言旣病之後。未敢臆斷也。　　其四曰支飮。其候曰。「欬逆倚息。短氣不得臥。其形如腫。」又曰。「支飮亦喘而不能臥。加短氣。其脈平。「又曰。「隔間支飮。其人喘满。心下痞堅。面色墨黑。其脈沈緊。」又曰。「心下有支飮。其人苦冒玄。」又曰。「支飮胸满。」又曰。「支飮不得息。」又曰。「今反不渴。心下有支飮故也。」又曰。「支飮家欬煩。胸中痛者。不卒死。至一百日一歲。」又曰。「其脈虚者。必苦冒。其人本有支飮在胸中故也。」又曰。「渴反止者。爲支飮也。支飮者。法當冒。冒者必嘔。」病源曰。」支飮。謂飮水過多。停積於胸隔之間。支乘於心。故云支飮。其病令人欬逆喘息。身體如腫之狀。」總上所述支飮之候。則脈平也。脈沈緊也。欬逆倚息。短氣不得臥也。喘满。心下痞堅。面色墨黑也。玄冒也。嘔也。不渴也。胸中痛也。身體如腫也。其言脈忽曰平。忽曰沈緊。不足爲訓。諸注家以平爲即是不弦。威以平爲即是沈緊。皆附會牽强之詞。不可據。要之脈象本不可　。古人言脈又皆荒誕不經。不足論也。曰倚息不得臥。即短氣之甚者也。曰面色墨黑。則循環不良。起鬰血也。曰眩冒。曰嘔。亦由胸中血行不良良而生。彼急性腦貧血。鬰血性腦充血。皆能發眩暈。如腦血管硬化之人。常患眩暈是也。眩暈之甚者。則發惡心與嘔吐。故有嘔也。心下痞堅者。肝中血鬰而脹大也。此往往作痛。故有胸中痛之候也。喘满短氣也。呼吸困難。所謂心藏性哮喘也。身體如腫者。心藏性哮喘。亦能成肺氣腫也。肺氣腫之爲候。背凸胸脹。腹亦澎满。以心肺下界及橫隔。皆降下故也。故曰「身體」。以非眞水腫之候。故曰「如腫」。肺氣腫之成就。有直接由呼吸器官病來者。有間接由心藏病來者。此則由心藏病來也。心藏病法當水腫。今不言者。心藏之病。常有先發欬逆。呼吸困難。肝脹大等候。而晚發皮　水腫者。不足爲異也。吾所以不以此爲呼吸器病而以爲心藏病者。金匱肺飮與支飮並言。是支飮外又有肺飮。知支飲非呼吸器病。其證一也。支飮諸候之中。如喘满。如心下痞堅。如短氣。如不渴。即金匱水在心之候。所謂水在心。心下堅築短氣。惡水不欲飲者也。是支飮即水在心。其證二也。心下痞堅。呼吸器病無此候。惟心藏疾病。則有鬰血肝可以説明。其證三也。言古騐今。皆與呼吸器病不合。而與心藏病相似。是以斷其爲心也。由此觀之。金匱之四飮。其病或在胃腸。或在心藏。其爲飮也。或由來之水而成。如痰飮懸飮是也。或因鬰血濾出之液面成。溢飮是也。或竟無水。支飮是也。原因不同。證候各異。漫然以「飲病」二字。爲之目以统之。其能切貼病情。治鬰解纷也。固然其無足怪也。鳴呼。此所以痰飮之説。紛紜雜亂。幾二千年。無人能整理之歟。</p>

<p>患肺癆的人們。常常地喉音作啞。或帶沙音。或完全失音。但有久暫的分别。若啞了數星期。略略休息。仍可恢復。或白天尚好。早間睡醒。與晚間倦乏時略啞。或談話多了。圍爐太久。一時啞嗓。那都不要緊的。最可怕的是常常的啞。那就危險的很。説不定喉頭便要損壤。進一步説。就是肺癆的邁進。　　尋常患的喉痺症。（俗名）大半是喉頭結核。他的痰吐必有病菌。設使和他同飮同吃。那碗碟杯匙食箸。千萬不可共用。否則定要傳染。　　肺癆中大約有十分之一强。必定種兼患喉症。到了嗓子發啞。須趕緊檢查喉頭。茲就其症的輕重。區分三種如左。　　（甲）喉頭現深淺的發炎狀。粘膜略腫。且兼溢血。聲帶之色呈斑剝狀　　。面上有時呈細薄潰瘍。有時無之。在此種症狀下。喉音失常是意中事。但不甚痛。　　（乙）喉頭兩邊現浸潤狀。潰爛之處甚多。且多深久。致喉頭爛壤。亦�</p>
<p>有病勢轉佳。喉爛中止。發生結痂。致喉蓋狹小。起喉管阻塞症。　　此種喉症的失音。或失其一半。或竟全失。而患處痛不可忍。因喉蓋　　與舌根間摺　組織。以及喉蓋本體。均遭結核的浸潤故也。　　（丙）此乃眞性喉頭結核。由喉頭組織之深處。發生細小之　。其上面　　之粘膜呈蒼白色。且有稀水。附近之細胞組織發現極甚之水腫。此種　　喉患。初起時無潰瘍發生。喉音或變或否。均無一定。但覺喉痛。　　　此症的進行。有時患者不甚覺察。遠瘤腫隆起。始自驚駭。一旦瘤腫潰裂。則危險萬狀矣。</p>

<p>（五）醫師助産士應有的注意</p>
<p>在分娩時，内诊愈少愈妙，蓋恐常由此送入病菌，或易引起早期破胞，或竟刺激子宮口，而增疼痛，致發痙攣性陣痛。　　倘無特殊情形，在未曾破胞之時，則以外诊爲妥，尤其是留心從陰道内流出分泌物的性狀及數量，胎聲，母體脈摶，泘吸，體温，陣痛發作與歇情形，膀胱是否充盈等狀况，概須一一嚴行監視。（丁）娩出期應有注意的要點</p>
<p>（一）腹壓</p>
<p>上面所述的嚴密監視，以迄破胞之時，産婦以取仰臥们較便便，或半臥位亦可，腰下置一小枕，在陣痛發作時，可令産婦用力加以腹壓，庶使胎兒從速娩出，雖不指示定在此時，但亦自然能加腹壓。</p>
<p>用繩漀於近頭部牀擋上或牀柱上（俗名癁産繩，）一面令産婦持繩之一端同時：令其兩足抵住於牀擋上的固定物上，如是方能着實用力，倘陣痛休息，切忌再用腹萌壓之力，否則徒勞無益。　　（二）娩出</p>
<p>兒頭更前進，産婦有便急之意，肛門哆開，在此時間，醫師助産士等，應該時刻留心胎心聲及産道壓壓狀况。如果胎兒進行遲缓，應速施行内诊，檢查兒頭是否轉正，如遇胎心聲有異，或其他異常時，亦應從速救濟。又如保護會陰術，乃是醫師助産的分内要務之一，倘使會陰緊張，立呈球形，同時：陰唇亦極緊張，在此千鉸一髮之際，兒頭方吿排出，於是胎兒出世。</p>
<p>（三）保護會陰</p>
<p>會陰爲什麽要保護？因爲：一，兒頭及肩胛部，通過軟部産　出口時，速度過急。二、兒頭愈大，陰道入口愈小。三。會陰組織異常發育，有硬固性，而少彈力性。四、恥骨弓狹小，陣痛加强，骨盆異常。　　上述四點，乃是會陰破裂的原因，自從會陰破裂後，最易侵入傳染菌，每致發生産褥鷙熱危險等症，所以不可不有保護會陰術，極力防止傳染。舊式穏婆，亦有瞭知。會陰堅硬，阻碍兒頭排出的道理，但彼輩就用汚穢不堪的長手指甲，狠心的剌會陰及陰唇，及至産婦在産褥時發生危險，尙不知原因何在，此種睛形，實在可憐又可嘆哩。</p>

<p>「獨行，獨坐，獨唱，獨酬還獨臥。」自古以來，一個婦女守着秉樓深閣，凄凉和寂寞，度過了枯案的一世。所以每每谈到婦女的詩詞中，大都是訴説一些：「腸斷芳草，身世孤零！」大部份婦女的人生觀，「衹一個愁字了得？」婦女與婦女間，一些也没有什麽相當的聯絡，自然更談不得什麽是婦女團結力。至多有三兩個蘭　采伴，也許可以踏靑郊外，　草　中；再或者在　齡幼會有靑梅竹馬，兩小無猜的情侶，但是到了花信待字以後，也祇好是若卽若離。過子嫁後光陰，更祇是「守着窗兒獨自怎生提黑？」要是能够「雲髮釵斜，笑語　郎。」已算是閨房中無上的幸福？所以綜觀婦女的一生，已絶對没有團結的可以。緃然有一些到了娘半老，愛國牌的，有凑局的搭子，信神好佛的，有燒香，做功課的香客，道友，但是無論如何總够不上團結二字。　　雖然在現在女權日高，也有一部份婦女呼號奔走，努力於社會公益善　，女學校裏更是學友如雲，踏上了社會市塲，也少不了職業界的同事，但是婦女們團結，依舊是十分困難　　試看在學校裏能，雖則師友同堂，良朋满座，不過知音的仍是寥寥無幾。一旦出了閣，有的竞自地角天涯，便從此不再相見。在各人自有各人的家務，以致隔絶的竟自隔絶，知已的却也漸疏散了。一直到今日家庭社會間的婦女，大都仍是散沙一盤，旣不曾想到婦女間應當聯絡結合，婦女有了團結力，也可以做許多偉大的工作。　　確已有少數先覺的女子，已組織了什麽　婦女協會，女靑年會等，究竟人數太少，力量自然薄弱了，參加的僅僅是幾们政治家的夫人，和幾们已有了地位有職業的婦女，或者竟還有參加入會而永遠不到會的，也並不算什麽奇怪事。　　不過要提倡婦女運動，首先要實際上使多數婦女團結起來。倘若徒有一紙空論，唱幾句女權高調，似科是無補於事；更或者讓一男人來替伊們努力鼓吹，那簡直是隔靴搔　。滑稽之至了。所要希望將來的女權如何發展？但看婦女們團結力如何罷。</p>

<p>年來國内糧食不足，致常有巨額之洋麥洋米等物之輸入，在此種病象之下，似不足以語農産之輸出。然農産一物，種類甚多，國中有不足之農産，亦有有餘之農産，觀吾國出口貨統計，尚以原料居大宗，卽足見農産之輸出，實爲國際借貸中之一巨大項目，加以鼓勵，非特有益於農民生活，亦且有補於國家經濟，蓋多一分之輸出，卽多一分之銷路，對於農村前途，大有裨裨益在也。就鐵路之立塲言之，農産之輸出，增多其運輸，業務亦必增多，自利利人，莫便於此，今欲從鐵路運輸方面鼓勵農産之輸出，厥有數法，申述於後　　（一）頒訂農産輸出特價及專價　農産品之欲輸出者，多由内地輾轉輸送，運至遁商大埠，始能出口，故運費一項，實爲出口農産品之一大負擔，今欲鼓勵其輸出，非頒訂一種特價或專價，分别减輕其擔負不可。此種特價或專價，祇得適用於眞正出口之農産；其運往國内各地銷售者，不得沿用。訂定特仠價或專價時，儘可不以里程爲绝對之根據，而採用一種分區運價Ｇｒｏｕｐ　Ｒａｔｅｓ之制度。所謂分區運價者，卽將産地分成若干廣大之區域，凡由同一區域運往某出口商埠之同一貨物，卽得收同一之運費，其里程之遠近，在同一區域以内，不加區别，如是則，遠在内地之農産，亦得有輪出之便利，不至因距離之遥遠而裏足不前，此分區運價之　點也。美國鐵路有採用此制者，其意亦在求實業之分佈並均平發展也。然則農産輸出特價或專價，一面旣較普通運價爲低，一面採用分區制度較諸普通運價之採里程制度者爲寛，有此二點，對於鼓勵農産之輸出，必能發採其有力作用，蓋一方减輕運費，一方剷除畛域，全國農産，幾都有均等輸出之機會，其數量之足以加多，當無疑也。至於分區之法，須視各地之産物而殊，凡産皒物相埓之地，均可劃入同一區域之内，以資平衡，而免軒輊。將來各地農産販賣合作機關成立，則可與之訂立農産輸出專價，從事專運，則較諸特價，將又作更近一步之鼓勵矣。</p>
<p>（二）實施農産中途停留業務　農産由内地運至商埠，在未輸出以前，往往須再經過相當手續，始能報裝出口；例如棉花之須壓實或重捆，米麥之須去榖或除糠，烟葉之須切製，　毛之須整理，茶葉之須改製等，均爲必要之手續，非此不足以應市塲之需要，成减輕輪運之費用者。且出口貨物，往往須在出口之地，停留相當時間，以便接洽買賣，或待輪起運，故能直接卸車裝輪者，固所在多有，而須中途停留者，亦比比皆是也。鐵路對於此種中途停留之出口農産，應與以種種之便利，最要者，莫如在鐵路之終點站，建築廣大之倉庫，俾得就近團存，不必車送他處，徒增耗費如能更進一步，在終點站附近之地招商建設各種打包機壓製造等工廠，以便出口農産之須經此種手續者，均得就近入廠處理，無須遠送，則尤爲經濟便利矣。此種工廠之建設，儘可　衡緩急，次第進行，最初專以大宗貨物所需之工廠爲限，將來逐漸推廣，以期普及可耳。</p>
<p>（三）實行海陸聯運　西國鐵路，均有與航海輪船公司聯運之辦法，且有自辦輪運業務，以求更進一步之聯貫者，如可拿大太平洋鐵路卽著例也。吾國鐵路對於海陸聯運，向未注意，殊足以磚輪出貿易之發展，今欲鼓勵農産輪出非實行海陸聯運不可，否則輾轉搬運，旣多耗費，亦多麻煩，　言鼓勵哉。海陸聯運之法，首在建設規模宏大之鐵路碼頭，俾航海繤輪，均可停靠，從事裝卸，并須有廣大倉庫，以備進出口貨之囤存，蓋不如是則由鐵路運到之貨，不能直接裝輪出口者，必多種種之周折與髦耗費也。此外　類起重機等之設置，亦應次第舉辦，以便　類之起卸，此海陸聯運應有之物質建設也。其次則鐵路與輪船公司間須訂立聯運合同，明定雙方之權利義務與責任等，並採用海陸聯運提貨單Ｔｈｒｏｎｇｈ　Ｅｘｐｏｒｔ　Ｂｉｉｌｌ　ｏｆ　Ｌａｄｉｎｇ以省手續，凡由内地運貨出口者，在起運站即可取得海陸聯運提單付法運雜各費手續卽告完畢，所有裝車裝輪之種種手續，均由鐵路或輪船公司代辦，無煩運商之照顧，其便利輸出爲何如？至於中途停留之貨，自不能適用海陸聯運提單，但其卸車裝輪之手續，仍得托由運輪人代理也。</p>
<h3 id="c155">（乙）保護國内農産 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>近年來國外糧食等農産源源輪入，以致號稱以農立國之中華，亦須仰給舶來之農産，年耗巨资資，至堪痛心。雖外國農産輸入，最初由於吾國農産之不足，以盈劑鹧虚，勢有固然。但降至今日，海外農産，亦多有以生産過剩，以開拓市塲爲目的而輸入者。馴致吾國固有之農産，被外貨所壓迫，市價一落千丈，雖遇豐收之年，農民亦苦無利可圖，由盈虚之調節，一轉而爲市塲之竸爭，其爲害固不僅不入超之數而已也。爲今之計，非保護本國之農産，不足以禦外來之壓迫，蓋農産之須保護，因與工業品無或異也。保護之法，在政府方面言，因以保護關税爲上，而就鐵路運輪方面言，亦有足資保護之法，其效或不亞於關税也。申論如次：　　（一）改良農産品之分等　查吾國鐵路分等之法，對於外貨向有差别待遇；例如棉秒疋頭之進口或外國製春，　列二等，「其他列四等，皮布之進口或外國罅者，列三等，其他（除另定外）列四等，均所以示保護而補吾國關税之不足也。然此種差别待遇，在農産品中尚無規定，例如米麥鮮果棉藏烟茶油類等物，均有外貨輪入，但分等表中尚無外貨國貨之分，此非分等之不完備，實因保護農産問題在吾國尚未加以深切之注意也。然農産之與外貨競爭者，應與工業品受同樣之保護，在農業國尤所當然，識者已早有論列，無待煩言。今後鐵路貨物分等對於本國農産之與舶來品競爭者，亦應與以差别之等級與待遇，庶幾本國農産多得一厝保障，不至爲外貨所壓倒，而一落千丈，榖賤傷農之挽救，此其一途乎？</p>
<p>（二）頒訂維護本國農産特價　從貨物分等之差别以保護本國之農産與减低運價之法相较，固屬殊途同歸，無或稍異，然照普通分等運價收費，有時仍嫌太昂，致失保護之本旨；結果，則市場仍爲外貨所奪，而國産被其排擠，例如國産之棉，有因運價過高，轉不如採用外棉爲廉者，他如米麥蔬菒亦然。蓋外國人工，雖較我國爲昂，然其生産爲有組織的，爲大規模的，且爲機械的，科學的，故其生産費用，未必較我國爲昂，加諸傾銷政策之盛行，過剩生産之排洩，在在足以壓　國産而有餘。故凡本國農産與外貨競爭甚烈者，除差别分等外，尚宜與以特别低廉之特價，以資澈底的保護。此種特價，亦可採用分區之原則，而不以里程爲根據，俾遠近各地之農産，均得與外貨競爭市塲，并起而代之。蓋近今商業戰爭，非集全國力量以爲應付不可，若遠方物産，徒以路程遥遠而阻滯，則競爭之力必爲之大减，保護云云，亦僅局部之小惠而已，此分區特價之所以尚也。</p>
<p>（三）頒訂節制進口農産特價　對於本國農産之之與外貨競爭甚烈者，應規定低廉之特價以維護之，已如上述。反之，對於此種與國産競爭劇烈之外來農産，亦應規訂一種高昂之特價以節制之，以抵禦之，庶幾雙管齊下，收效自易。規定此種特價時，吾人須先調查此種外國農産之生産成本，以與本國同樣産品之成本相較，如前者大於後者，則進口特價不妨稍低，前者小於後者，則進口特價應特别提高，務使本國農産取得較　之地位，以增加其競爭能力。例如某種外來糧食，每石之生産成本（連輪運費在内）爲五元，而本國同樣産品之成本爲四元五角，雖前者大於後者，然國産未必能爲外貨之敵，蓋外貨之生産規模較大，一以薄利多賣爲主旨，如該貨每石能售六元，在彼以數量衆多，獲利已漙，而我則農户生産，能力漙弱，所入仍屬無幾，較諸外貨尙未侵入之時所獲已大見减少也，其所受影響蓋可想見。况外貨成本，未必均較國産爲高，年來國中物力維艱，而生産方法墨守　規，加諸　税繁重，損耗殊多，農産成本，竟有超過市價以　者，農民鶉衣菜色，非偶然也。故爲今計，非節制外來農産，無以謀國産之昭蘇，在政府未便徵收保護關税際，亟應從運價方面，謀一相當出路，此即所謂進口農産特價是也。在　路不與水道競爭之地，此　特價，儘可推行無阻。其有競爭之處，應與水道謀協作，共同進行，勿以利益之　殊，　國家經濟於不顧，則事亦未始不可爲耳。</p>
<h3 id="c156">列强眞會對日經濟封鎖嗎？　徐枬 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>二月二十四日國際聯盟以全體對一票的絶對多數，通過開於東北事件的大會報告書。國人都額手相　，以爲這是中國在外交上的絶大勝利，也是公理自在人心的表現，誠然，國聯對於我們已盡了面子是的責任，至於决議案之是否能發生效力，須看在决議案之後，有没有制裁實力。假使没有，還不是等於一紙具文？國人很明暸這點，所以仍舊拿以前期待國聯的態度，希望國聯會員國對日加以制裁，現在，我們就來討論铏强對日制裁的可能性如何？　　我們先看國聯有幾種制裁違約的方法據。</p>
<p>盟約第十六條所載，國聯有三種方法，制裁違約國，（一）經濟封銷，（二）兵力制裁，（三）除名，日本不待除名，早已於三月二十七日正式宣告退出，第三種制裁法當然不發生效力。至於兵力制裁，現代各國已没有中世紀十字軍人那末熱心，肯爲眞理信仰而犠牲，於是所剩下的唯一希望，祗有經濟封鎖了。　　「聯盟會員國如不顧第十二·十三·及十五·各條之規定，訴諸戰爭，事實上卽爲對於其他全體會員國搆成戰事行爲。後列各國，應即刻與其斷絶一切通商及金融關係；禁止本國人民與違約國人民交通；又不問其是否爲聯盟會員國，防遏他國人民與達約國人民發生金融上，通商上，及個人之交通關係」。（盟約第十六條第一欵）在經濟關係已經非常密切的今日，這種制裁是很嚴厲的。然而要經濟土封鎖全發生效力，非具有兩大條件不可；（一）海上完全封鎖，（二）列國共同戰線，日本地形狹長，四環海，絶對封鎖非常困難，日本海軍部亦於三月二十二日發表聲明；「國民對於任何封鎖，决不屈服，…………萬一而發生封鎖，海軍省準備以實力應付，………」因此經濟封鎖的第一條件，已經不能成立。　　第二條件如何？卽使聯盟會員國實施封鎖，而非會員國不共同行動，封鎖不易發生實效。這在上次戰時，美國未麥戰前協約國對德封鎖中很明顯地表示出來了。所以我們要以美國的態度加入考譪慮，查日美兩國貿易關係，向極密切，一九三二年日本圇輪出總額十四億一千萬日金，對美輪出四億四千五百萬，佔全輪出十分之三·二，同年輸入總額十四億三千一百萬日金，由美國輪入才佔十分三·六，美國顯然居於順調地位。從貿易品而論，日本對美輸出以生絲爲大宗，一九三二年日本輸出生絲五十四萬七千斤，三億八千二百萬日金，美國佔五十一萬二千斤，三億六千日金，英國一萬三千斤，九百萬日金；法國一萬二千斤，七百萬日金，美國佔十分之八以上。同年一月至十月，美國總輸出十三億四千二百萬美金，對英二億四千二百萬，佔十分之一·八；加拿大二億千萬美金，佔十分之一·六；法國一億一千二百萬，佔十分之○·八；日本一檍億六百萬，較法國略小，居第四位。美國重要農業品的棉花，在該年輸出八百九十一萬八千担，對日二百二十三萬九千担，佔百分之二十五；對英一百四十八萬六千担，而以日本居第一位。由此而觀，日本佔美國棉花輸出的第一位，美國佔日本生絲輸出的第一位，如美國對日封鎖，日本的棉織業和　桑業固大受影響，而美國的絲織業，也將瀨於危境。且美國農民已經非常困難，再加大旦棉花輸出的終止，生計一定更盛。所以從弳濟而論，美國不至對日經濟封鎖。　　英日兩國的貿易關係，并不如美日的密切，近年英國對日輸出，且有滅退趋勢；如一九三○年英國輸出總額七億七千一百萬鎊，日本佔八百萬鎊；一九三二年一月至九月輸出總額二億七千一百萬鎊，日本佔四百四十萬鎊；不過爲英國全输出的百分之五强。同年同時日本對英输出爲五百萬鎊，和英國全輸人五億二千萬鎊相較，不過百分之一强。而且英國棉布與日本棉布處於尖鋭竸爭地位，下表表示一九三二年英日二國棉布勢力概况，單位百萬平方碼。</p>
<p>對中國　日本一九四　英國一二五　　對印度　日本一九四　英國一二五　　對　洲　日本二三一　英國二八一　　對南洋　島　日本三五二　英國　四四從上表而論，除菲洲一處外，英國勢力都不不敵日本當然願意乘經濟封鎖機會，把日本勢力逐出。　　然而事實没有這樣簡單，日本對英本國貿易關係雖不深切，而對英領地的貿易額，却甚浩大，而尤以澳州及印度二處爲最著。一九三一年印度全輸出十五億九千九百萬羅比中，對日输爲一億四千萬，僅次於曲國；同年印度總輸入十二億六千五百萬羅比中，由日本輸入者佔一億三百萬，更就棉花而論，同年印度輸出四億二千三百萬噸，日本佔一億九千三百萬噸，英國反祗有三千萬噸，不過爲日本六分之一，一九三一年澳澳澳洲輸出總額一億八百萬鎊，對日一千一百六十萬鎊，佔百分之十八；輸入總額五千七百萬鎊，日本佔二百七十萬鎊，約百分之五。澳洲顯在處於順調地位，澳洲對日輸出中，以羊毛及小麥爲大宗，同年日本由澳輸入小麥十億萬斤，佔小麥輸入總額十分之八以上；又羊毛一億四千九百萬斤，佔羊毛全輸入百分之九十七。而澳洲購買日本的生絲以及絲織品，不過爲對日输輸出價值之四分之一。假使英國斷然對日經濟土封鎖，則印度的棉花以及澳洲的小麥和羊毛，必失去一重要市塲，英國必有相當顧慮。而且近年保守黨得勢，念英日同盟舊情，對日時相提携，遠東方面的印度，也有拜托日本共同保障之意，的以經濟封鎖的可能性更少了。　　英美兩大國的情勢，旣如上面所述其他如德法意俄等國或則因爲關係不深，不願多管閑事；或則正從事於自已建設，無暇顧慮。於是經濟封鎖的第二條件，　列强共同戰線　也不打自破。　　國聯的三種制裁，卽除名，兵力制裁，和經濟封鎖，旣都不發生效力，那末大會决議茶，還不是一纸空文，寫本文的動機，决不是長他人威風，滅自已志氣，而是希望國人打破持外助圖僥倖的因　心理，認清客觀的經濟事實，爲自已謀一出路。現在，我們還是再　國聯坐以待斃呢？還是對日妥協，拱手讓人呢？還是發奮自强抵抗暴力呢？這是要我們國民自自已下一决心來。</p>
<h3 id="c157">外貨傾銷與國民經濟　　任逢辛 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>來日貨傾銷，遍及吾國，據實業部所調查，倾銷貨物，有煤斤·紗·布·人造絲·纸·水泥·魚·等六種。國人對於傾銷之外貨，應有相當之認　，否則爲一時小利所蔽，而貽國計民生以大患，無殊飲酖止渴，追悔莫及，用將外貨倾銷與吾國國民經濟之關係，爲國人一述之，俾得明辨得失，計及利害，庶不爲所利用矣。　　日本以煤·絲·纸·水泥·魚·等，削减售價，交由華商進，轉以低價出售於市塲，消費者較諸未傾銷前，付少量金錢，得相等貨物。不知者以爲所得貨物如故，所付費用較少，似有利於吾國消費者。而一究其實，有未盡然。蓋傾銷貨物，期限不一，爲脱售生産過剩貨物，而傾銷國外市塲者，名曰臨時傾銷，以壓迫外商，獨佔國外爲傾銷目的者，曰短期傾銷，如其傾銷，在保持大規模生産，用以低减成本者，則爲長期傾銷。於此三種傾銷中，唯臨時傾銷與長期傾銷，確有利於被傾銷加之消費者，至若第二種短期傾銷，則於消費者，不僅無利，抑且有害。近今盛行吾國之外貨傾銷，大率爲短期傾銷，最近之日貨傾銷，卽其一例，揆其用意，乃在壓迫吾華商，獨佔吾市塲，其所謂削價脱售，旣非假以出清過剩貨物，又非藉以維持大規模生産，而抱有「侵略」「掠奪」之野心。此種短期傾銷，乃以傾銷爲手段，而以獨</p>
<p>佔爲目的，唯其獨佔爲目的，故不惜先以削價出售方法，結歡吾國消費者，一俟時機成熟，彼將起而獨佔吾市塲，其時將盡景抬高市價，取償傾銷時所受之損害。至此，吾國消費者，唯有兩手自縳，聽其宰割而已。總之，外貨傾銷於吾國，大都爲短期傾銷，吾國人雖能費較少之金錢，　相等之貨物，日常生活，不無裨益。不知此種小利，係一時而非永久，係手段而非目的，老子云，「將欲奪之，必固與之，」其是之謂也。　　再就外貨傾銷與國民生物經濟之係言之，就平時而讑，吾國生産事業，較諸外商企業，已大相逕庭，不讑於資本組織管理技術品質推銷諸端，吾國貨工業，無一不在外商工業之下。一方同以速年戰亂，國事蜩　，政府無力亦無睱盡其提倡保護之責。他方國貨工業，自相傾軋，故自封，亦屬咎由自取。故在通常狀態下，換言之，卽外貨不用其傾銷方法，吾國貨工業，亦早處於不利之地位，猶如一人病入膏肓，卽不遭打撀，亦已朝不保夕。今外貨如變本加　，實行傾銷，則無　以拳足加諸病　，益促吾國貨工業之崩潰已耳。據最近報載，開　煤礦，因受日煤傾銷影響，存貨滯銷，受害非淺，卽此一例，亦足　外貨傾銷之不利於吾國生産業矣。在今日情形之下，吾國工貨業，欲效　外貨之傾銷，則心有餘而力不足，卽勉强削價，以相周旋，然究其實，亦無異自殺而已，何也，蓋吾國貨工業，先天　弱，加以政府不予保護，後天養育盡　，勉與强者頡　，其有不召　　者乎？然欲與世無爭，一任　貨傾銷，則大好市塲，盡被蹂踫　，喧賓　主，爲患　已，是　亦難，退亦難也。　　外貨傾銷與吾國國民經濟之關係，具如上述，至其應付方策，容再爲文文論之。</p>
<h3 id="c158">國際貿易與關税戰　楚玉 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>今日全世界之國際留易；其混亂狀態，至今日而愈甚矣。溯自十九世紀之第四半期以來，世界關税政策，漸傾於保護貿易主義，高築關税之障壁，防制外國品之輪入，以謀國内産業之發　，此種保護貿易主義，久已風靡世界。良以外國商品之輪入，經濟侵略之急進手段，各國爲謀自存計，不得不增高關税耳。雖然，國際貿易，遂因此而發生混亂狀態。自歐洲大戰以後，各國咸以熱烈的促自國産業之復與，但受此高率關税政策之影響，金本位制度之動摇，致國際貿易，發生不安之氣象。迴憶前年秋季，英國因脱離金本位制，各國貨幣價格，隨之激變，而國際貿易，竟引起重大的波澜。凡貨幣價格低落國之商品，以對外匯兑低廉爲武器，突向貨幣價格較高國之市場，猛力發展，此輪出品之增加國，固爲得策，然而在貨幣價格較高之國，乘國際匯兑之低廉，商品之輪出，多以匯兑傾銷而爲其防制。例如關税税率之增加，傾銷税之新設等，在在使金本位制動摇。於是國際貿易上，發生異常紊亂。故今日世界各國，爲預防匯兑低落國商品之輪入，莫不注重於關税政策。以是往年國際貿易，在平等的自由競爭狀態時施行之保護關税政策，與今的之關税戰，迴異其旨。不過今日之關税戰，皆因金本位制動摇，旣不能恢復安定市塲，又不能排除　患，不得不變本加厲以抵抗外國也。　　由此觀之，在今日國際貿易舞台混亂時代，所謂匯兑傾銷防制案，關税增加税率，與其報復關税率等關税戰，其最受影響者，卽爲貨幣價格激落之國。近來美法二國，因金之集中變態，與金本位制互相呼應，以致國際總决算上，又生障碍，特金保有額較少之國，努力於貿易之均衡，以免金之流出，乃有贸易管理之　。例如亞爾善了，輸入量少於輪出量，七耳其以不買商品，願廢棄通商條約等，皆本此政策而起也。蓋藉貿易管理與相類似之政策。得以徹底的防壓匯兑傾銷之手段故也。</p>

<p>— 天方</p>
<p>説起「假道」，我們便會想起春秋時候晋　公滅　那一套把戲。這真是一椿可怕的陰謀，使三千載下的人們聞而猶有戒心。　　最近抵抗空氣，甚爲緊張，據報載閩粤桂三省出師北上抗日，原定集中韶關，經廣州聯合北上，在閩十九路軍已下令動員，『不圖粤省軍事當局忽對於十九路軍之「假道」東江，發生問題，曾去電蔡廷楷，「本省發生紙幣風潮，如大軍過境，恐民衆不察真相，引起誤會，於粤局前途，致生影響。」其後復暗示汕頭市黨部，發也此項同樣之電文，以爲張目？』四月十日某某報　　誰也想不到抗日的大軍過境，會引民衆的「誤會」，致影響「粤局前途」，民衆真是阿斗「抗日」大計之不知，亡國之禍，其難免乎？所可異者，「爲民先鋒」的汕頭市黨部，竟因爲人「張目」而發出此項「同樣電文」，頗有致疑於目前之情勢，大槪這「先鋒」是在前線「批尖」了。先鋒旣打尖，於是「後盾」也就「稍息」，或是「向後轉」，一幕抗日喜劇，於焉吿終。　　民衆全是「阿斗」，固無可諱言，但粤軍事當局的尊重民意，却是值得贊許的。有此阿斗，自然少不了這些諸葛亮。「客軍」！注意，這裏所指並非是英美或日法的軍隧，切勿誤會！入境，頗足疑懼，何况歷史上又有那怕人的先例，據説畫馬的是照着自已的形象畫的，所以諸葛亮也者的恐懼，或更甚於一般阿斗。</p>
<p>「抗日」爲國，「國」是大家的，「省」却是咱們的，這關係不是更爲密切嗎？何况日帝國主義的砲彈還未落到廣州市上，據「就地抵抗」之眞詮，也無此必要，　至少是太早，所以倘使我做粤省軍事當局，就决不呑呑吐吐，老實地説：「你要抗日，此路不通」。旣母須乎「暗示」，更不必他人爲我「張目」，豈不直　了當，所謂「前途」「影響」等等費解的話頭，也可不説。　　生在二十世紀的中國，眞是什麽都有點　糊，不要説外國人看了費解　如一國的軍隧，而有所謂「假途」之類　自已也不很了然。唉，枉铸了二十有餘年大中華民國的公民，而於「黨」「國」大事，如此茫然，我其終於「阿斗」矣乎？</p>
<h3 id="c166">掃墓的回憶　　賓符 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>每年的三月三日彷彿綢是晴的，我家規定每年的這天去掃墓。我們是Ｗ鄕人，但因爲種種便利的綠故，我們住在離Ｚ鄕四十时的Ｎ市中。Ｚ鄕和Ｎ市間有段短短的火車，四十里的距離只需三十分鐘就到達了。因此我們每年到故鄕摕墓，常是是附乘三月三日的早班火火車去的。　　照例到了Ｚ鄕以後，我們先去掃高曾祖的墓。參與的人，除了我們一家以外，還有四家的族人。我們在鄕原是個大族，我們這一集團，只是大族中的一支。這一支，共分成五家，五家的人合了攏來，可就不少了，再加上幾十名的輪夫，雜役，還有吹手大吹大擂着，「點點　打打」，頓時把寂寞的田野間點綴得十分熱閙。附近的牧童農婦者停止了工作趕集了攏來，像有什麽重大事情發生似的。祭墓的時候，儀式是很隆重的，一個主祭　主祭常是我底父親　之外，還有兩個襄祭，還有一個　祭文，這祭文差不多年年是這麽一套。祭完了以後，還要來幾聲「匹力拍拉　蓬」的爆竹，這聲音，常把睡在楊柳樹下的懶牛驚得跳起來。一陣「匹拍」之後，接着就有許多的牧童聚搶小鞭砲的剩餘，往往因此會引起兇限的爭鬥。這些事情，在當時是最使我感到興趣的，當時我以爲掃墓的意義也就在於這點。　　當午就在我們的老家吃飯，這就是所謂「散胙」。用過了午飯，我們一家的人才出發到祖父的墳頭去。春天的太陽燦爛地高張着，雖説是春日郤也已儘足使我們流汗了。祖瑩在Ｚ鄕北門外的一個同　中，那裏，鄕村的風味自然是更加濃厚。深黑的森林，　　的小溪，即使童子的我，也感着無限的怡悦。交親一手拿着杖，一面低吟着詩句，在曲折的麥隴中邁健地步行着，大哥和我，都默默地隨在後面。這時候，除了營營的蜂蜂聲，或是山腰裏的人語聲以外，切都是寂靜的，即使那絮聒的狗，也多攔路熟睡着。到了墓前，管墳的人早已把香燭祭　布置好了。他一見交父親，總要急不及待地報吿這墓前的石頭如何如何的給人家俞了去，墓後的松樹又如何如何的給大風吹倒了，結果總是父親答應给給他些錢呌他去補好，這差不多每年是的慣例。祭掃過以後，父親默無一語地在在墓前徘徊着，百容間充满着深沉的悵惘，我呢？卻忙着摘草採花，撲蜂捉蝶，因爲當時，我只　得這才是掃墓的眞意義啊。</p>
<p>去年三月，我又到故鄕掃墓。山色依舊是靑蒼的，北門外Ｚ湖的波光依舊是明媚的，只是我的心已不復是開展的</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>了！在Ｚ湖到祖　　段路的中間，增加了一座新墳，這裏，安眼着我親愛底父親。　　我竚立吸　，波光倒照着我孤苦的影子，到這時，我才體騐到父親的悲哀已是輪到我了。我在暮色蒼茫中，反顧那　然的新塜，我不禁腸斷了！</p>

<p>提倡女權運動的先决問題，無疑的，自然先要求婦女在社會方面，得有職業上的自由，經濟獨立了，一般的婦女，才能脱離了種種的苦痛和刺縳。在中國，女權運動的呼聲，也已鬧過了不少的年頭，一般奔走婦運的先鋒，都在呐喊着走向社會中去的口號，而在力謀職業上男女的半等。然而事實上中國的婦女，到而今依然大半沉浸在醉生夢死之中，依賴性依然深深的種的心窠。在她們以爲嫁了人，一切的一切，生活上所需要的，自有丈夫來供給，本用不到女人去擔心。這原因，她們日常的生活，除了吃，睏，和玩之外，其餘便什麽都没有事情做了。　　在這裏，一説隔鄰的幾個師母的生活，便可知道她們生活的安逸而平時什麽都不擔心事呢　東鄰的趙師母，她的丈夫趙先生，在洋行口當一個中等的職員，大槪每月可有百元的進欵；西隔壁的李師母，她的丈夫李先生，在一個機關中充當秘書，每月的收入，也充乎其量不過百元吧？這兩位先生，同樣地每天在很怱忙的工作着，然而説起了這兩位師母的生活，却太是舒服了吧？做了一個總統的夫人，恐怕也汉有也們這樣的舒服吧？</p>
<p>這兩位師母，每天至早要睡到吃中飯才起來，趙家雖然不用人，但趙先生的那位六十歲已過的母親，每天獨當了一切的家務，自燒飯，洗衣，以至倒馬桶，完全由她一人包辦，人家説她名義上雖是趙先生的母親，實際上整天在牛馬般的工作，無非是一個不必出工錢的女傭啊　李家僱着一個中年的女傭，一切的家事，都由她操作，所以這兩位師母，對於家事便用不到她們去擔一分心了。</p>
<p>日上三竿，廚房裏的飯已煑熟了，師母才懶洋洋的起了床，吃過了中飯，東鄰，西鄰，拉幾位太太來碰幾圈麻將，如果三缺一坐不攏打扮好了出去聽聽書，狂逛戲塲。晚上回來，吃過晚飯，檔了一定坐得攏一局一局，再碰一局，打麻將比吃飯，每天不打不過瘾，晚上至少要打到了兩三點鐘才睡。　　因爲睡得太晚了，早上自然不能爬起來，趙先生，李先生，老清早起來辦公，攪動了被窠，驚醒了師母，會吃牌頭而彼她們駡幾句山門，最可惡是那個不　相的倒老爺，一大早就來殺天倒地的毃門，每天總是鬧醒了師母們初睡時的好夢，又那呌她們不駡幾聲殺坏啊？倒老爺去了，先生出了門，師母們才得一忽睡到吃中飯，没有人再來纒擾了。　　我瘊如果把師母們的生活檢查一那每天的課程，差不多總離不掉吃，睏，打牌，游玩這四門功課的吧？真舒服呢！</p>

<p>— 靜</p>
<p>日帝國主義的满洲政策，竟不費一舉手之勞而得實現，眞是出其意料之外；想不到少帥旣採取不抵抗主義將東三省奉送，而𤍠渴亦不例外，聽到喜到峯的失利，也就不甘落後（就忙將家私運走），未戰先逃，於是承德又落入其手，事實如出一轍，頗有「君子　讓」之風，但從另一方面看來，却有些不同，在東三省喪失之後，我們只聽到些「收復失地」的空調，事實上並没有見到少帥或任何人的一兵一卒的出動；這次承德失陷，却有効法「民族英雄」的孫宋二將軍「大演其全武行」，單刀肉摶，盛極一時，雖説是很短的一幕，無傷日帝國主義的毫末，畢竟出了一下風頭，較之以前「鴉雀無聞」，總要「冠冕堂皇」一點，自然結果仍歸一樣，失地依然是失了，不會有半點收回，且因某種關係，雙方已吿掩旗息鼓，誠如某要人所云：「現在雙方主力無甚接觸，」換言之，快要平靜無事，正合一般酷愛和平的小百姓，相慶太平將至。　　然而翻開報紙一看，戰神並未匿跡，反在繼續活躍，不過這次戰事的重心，普非在對外而是移回到對内，有人説這是貫澈「攘外必先安内」的主張，此舉乃理所當然，無庸置議，况當此朝野上下（？）舉國一致（？）共赴國難的當兒；竟有那不顧大體而專事搗亂的共匪，乘承德之失，大打其出手，致使剿匪隧伍之師旅　營各長官傷亡幾十位之多，其他下級兵士更不必説，且有政取撫州南昌之勢，據説那些前仆後起的傻漢，並没有剿匪軍隧那樣聰明，能知道種種作戰計畫，譬如誘敵深入，一鼓蕩平那樣欲擒先縱的戰略，所以事實上的喪師失地，都不過是誘敵之餌，用不着什麽顧慮，况剿匪軍隧如此之多，地又那麽廣，幾師人馬與幾個城池的喪失，算得什麽一回事，且政府諸公早已有見於此，正在調兵遣將，坐鎭視察，馬上要殺個不休，安内也就有日矣。　　同時，我們也可以看到日帝國主羲的深明大義，不幹趁火打刦的勾當，竟在政府諸公一再聲明誓不「直接交渉」，簽訂「辱國條約」，及「長期抵抗」種種政策之下，停止其野心侵略，放棄佔取平津之舉，好使政府諸公先行安内，再來與之較量，眞是慷慨已極。　　所以，這裏所説「前綫平靜無事」，無須小子　述，自然可想而知了。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>自貴欄專爲店員們解答疑難雜問而出世後，吾輩身爲店員者，獲得了莫大的利便。茲有一事相詢，伏祈不吝珠玉，詳爲指答。舍親某，於數年前，與友人等合股設一米肆於閘北某路。初時營業甚佳；詎意一二八戰役，除在店中服務而又爲股東之三人，因未住店内，而得倖免外，餘均被日軍捕去。氨無下落，蓋早已成爲暴日鐵蹄下之犧牲者矣。當戰事底定，協定吿成，戰區開放之後，將店中存米，分償各債户外；其他各股東，鑒於所放賬欵，達一萬七八千元之鉅，雖因賬户星散，又須償付債務數千元，但全部股本，總不致完全蝕去，遂議定重行復業。在他們數次集議的時候，對於被難者家屬，並未通知。後因被難者俱係年輕壯丁，平日一家數口，端頼若輩之收入，藉以維持生活：今一旦罹難，其慘悽之情狀，不言可知。該家屬等，迫於飢寒，曾數度往見股東，要求予以救濟，酌給體恤金。但店東等總是你推我諉，一味延宕；以一般老弱婦稚之家族，欲與飽經世故之男子相周旋，怎會得到勝利呢　他們現在所收的賬欵，究有多少：償還債務以後，是否尚有多餘，抑又不足；吾人不得而知。即使説股本已無剩餘，難道對於店員因店務而罹難者，不應負撫恤的責任嗎？現在他們又暫行停業，改換店名，重合新股，再行開業；冀遂其卸却撫恤被難者的責任了。　　先生，你想他們未及於難者，仍能衣於斯，食於斯，取用於斯：而彼被難者的寡妻孤兒，反得洷林株毫利潤。揆�</p>
<p>諸情理，得謂平乎？　　先生，你看彼被難者的家屬，可以向他們要求撫恤金碼？又怎向他們要求呢？假使他們不理，又怎樣呢？　速賜　，則感激不盡了。專此並頌</p>

<p>編者按：從這封信裏；我們看到一件很可疑的事情：爲什麽在店中服務而又爲股東的三人，均能倖免。他們是不是一向並不住在店中的呢？還是股東畢竟比店員自由，所以在風聲緊急的時候，可以先事防範，不住在店中的呢？倘使他們的得免於難，完全是因爲先事防範的話，那末這可以反證店員們的慘遇，完全是因爲効患於股東的結果。我雖不殺伯仁，伯仁由我而死，股東方面應當盡力去撫慰他們的遺族。要是他們的「不住店中」，是一種習慣，他們的不死，眞是僥倖；那末當然又當别論了。罪魁禍首的日本人，我們小百姓，當然不能零零碎碎的去向他算賬；但是以「建築在民衆」的立塲上的政府，就不得不請他墊出一筆巨欵，來救濟救濟了。好在抗日救國，已有整個計畫，最後勝利，可操左券；將來不妨由你去向日本總算賬好了。此外還有什麽團體，什麽公團，他們因爲要來救濟戰區災民，曾經想了許多方法，籌集過許多欵項，單單一批大香檳票的收入，已很可驚人。你們旣經是戰區災民，你們就可以起來問問他的下落呀　戰區被難人民的家族，要是有一個得不到這筆錢的利益，何論你賬目如何公開，手續如何周到，終不能不使人懹疑。至少分配不均的過失，是百喙難辭吧！</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>愛國運動原是每個國民應有的表示，也可以説是大學生的分内之事，照理講根本没有發生什麽問題的可能；但是神秘而矛盾的中國政，却偏極顚顚倒的想禁止，而一般大學生中，也往往有許多自小頭便尖的「政客的幼虫」們在中間操縱，借請願游行做某黨傾軋某派的利器，這樣就使政府當局越發有止的藉口。學生們也越發的不讓他禁止，雙方的主張愈　愈遠，便各自走到了極端方面去，那就倒霉了當校長的人，一方面老是打起了官話，竭力的要責成他制止學潮，取締罷課，一方面却又灌足了满腔熱血，誓死不服干涉，如果你的態度稍不和馴一些的話，「官僚」「走狗」等等的新頭銜，便立刻　止了。×大學生旣多，分子又複雜，地位又在首都，因此愛國運動之熱，更比别的學堂厲害得多了。伍逸雖然已是上了年紀的人，可是他爲了日本獸軍强佔東三省而所抱的悲憤，實在不輸如年輕的人，所以他對於學生們的集會，游行，演講，完全採取放任政策，絲毫不加限制，不用説，他這樣不負責任態度，當然不是政府當局所能满意的，有好幾個執政的要人，已曾轉　的敎人送了幾次警吿給他涼是他的令高足　×部長　也再三　説要他设法限制學生的行動，然而他的答復總是「待亡了國再限制罷」的一句冷語。後來他令高足也惱了，很有請他老人家回府去休息的意思，無奈學生都做了他的擁護者，一時竟無如之何了。</p>
<p>「寗可犧牲一切，愛國運動却斷不能破壤」伍大塼士往往很堅决地向人們這樣宣示着。　　「校長　請你上大禮堂去開會，我們要處置一個破壤我們全體名譽，阻撓檢貨運動的敗類」某一日的午後，學生會忽然派了二個幹事來向伍逸報吿一件驚伯消息。　　「眞有這事嗎。」</p>
<p>「怎麽不眞！」兩個幹事異口同聲的確認着。　　「好！好當然該處置　我馬上就去　」伍逸也表示十二分的憤　，怱怱戴上了一副光度很深的玳瑁眼鏡，便隨着兩個學生，望大禮堂奔去。「滴鈴……滴鈴　！」摇着集會鈴的　　，興　地　各處飛跑着，敎授</p>

<h3 id="c174">好萊塢電影明星抱養螟蛉子心理之一斑 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 西容</p>
<p>去年的好萊塢盛行之領養「螟蛉子」的風氣。這種風氣繼續到今年，而最後一個領養「螟蛉」的，就是現在「羅宮春色」一片中的主角，茀德立馬區，近來發表了一篇領養「螟蛉」的意見，將一對照愛夫妻的心理，描盡得躍紙上，呼之欲出。可見天下人結婚後，經過了多少年而不生子，容易引起一種空虚的煩悶，或無後的恐怖。這種「無後爲大」的心理，或「膝下猶虚」的暵惜，並不限於我們這重孝的中國人也。　　茀德立馬區領的是螟蛉女，名字呌潘妮洛潑（Ｐｅｎｅｌｃｐｅ），簡稱爲膰妮。茀德立馬區於六七年前與名女星福羅惀絲愛德立治Ｆｌｏｒｅｎｃｅ　Ｅｌｄｒｌｄｇｅ結婚，但至今子息全無。愛德立胎，嫁茀德立馬區的時候，準備犠牲了一生的事業,去和茀德立馬區組織一善美的家庭.但是家庭而無小孩,不成爲家庭的。所以他們結婚之後，經過一年二年還没有生兒子，愛德立治就煩悶得了不得。她就要想抱一個螟蛉子，但是其時茀德立馬區還不相信他們有會生自已的兒子，要去抱他人之子以爲已子？所以他婉轉地拒絶了她的請求。但是一年復一年的過去，以至三四年，五六年，那隻送子之鶴，總不降臨他們的住屋。愛德立治於是因思子情切，竟至容顔消瘦，精神恍愡起來。茀德立馬區於是就恐慌起來了。這樣他們就互相同意着，倘再經過一年，而仍無生子的朕兆，他們就一定抱一螟蛉之子，以娱膝下。　　這樣又過了一年，終於毫無音信，他們就開始了螟蛉子的尋求。愛德立治因爲想念要一個兒子，所以看見了一個初生不到兩個月的男孩子，就淧得了不得，立意要領他。茀德立亦很喜歡那孩子，不過有一黩，就是那孩子總不像是他們俩自已生的，因爲茀德立馬區和愛德立治却是棕色頭髪的，而那個孩子，却是黄頭髮的。正在遲疑不决之間，有一位知交替他們尋到了一個初生的女孩。他們去一相看之下，都驚奇得了不得。　　原來這女孩子，棕髮大眼，形貎與茀德立馬區十分直像。他們想他們將來一定能視她如已出，所以就决定領她回去了。茀德立馬區想起和那女孩子初會面的時候，至今還覺得欣欣樂道。他説「很奇怪的，她看見了我們，就好像知道將來要歸於我們似的。她欣欣地笑着。她那時不過三個星期六，但是已經能認識她將來的父母了。她的面貌，人家看見了，一定知道是我們自已生的，或者我們自已生的，還没有這麽好呢。」　　茀德立馬區是不大相信遺傳性的，所以他們領養這螟蛉子的時候，並没夽　深切地考察她的父母是誰。不過他深知她生産以前的背景是良善的，所以以後亦不至於有什麽不好的印象在那女孩的心靈中。　　還有一個問題，就是潘妮長大了，要不要使她知道她是領養的呢？茀德立馬區和愛德立治却贊成等到她大些，明白了事理之後，就同她講明白。他説這樣可以使她更快活些，因爲抱養的子女。本身並没有什麽不名　的事，她不用爲此而覺得慚愧。但是倘使這種事實不和她講明白，而隐瞒起來，她將來聽見人家告訢她之後，反而會當做一件不好聽的事，因此而與父母的感情破裂了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c175">評「球影珠光」Ａｌｌ　Ａｍｅｒｉｃａｎ <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>劇情胡閙　攝影頗佳</p>
<p>一個好的影片，必然的要以好的劇本爲骨幹。雖然這種劇本也可以取材於極平凡的事件，但是無論如何，總應當有其本身的價值。　　現階段的美國電影，很顯然早已陷於他們所親手掘成的深沉的泥坑中，也許永遠不能找着一條比較正當的出路。雖然少數作品仍能使觀衆在銀幕之前，體認出相當的含義，但是大多數的作品，却是顯然的趨於胡閙。　　就本片「球影珠光」而論，當我勉强睜開欲睡的眼睛看完之後，我極力在記憶中尋求，可是始終不能了解這片子到底吿訴我一些什麽。　　故事大槪是這樣的：一個「球王」突然變更主意而從事商業，頗爲其未婚妻所反對。在商塲中因其過去之「檾譽，」而偶然得着一個富商的女公子的靑睞，於是免不了發生戀愛。從此日夜沉醉於酒色賭塼之中，甚至於貧窮倒。其後總算是頓改前非，復在球塲中獲得勝利。於是，當然和未婚妻團圓和好。　　這裏所吿訴我們的是什麽呢？充其量不過是救人們不可悞入岐途。而且故事結構，也是散漫平庸而不見曲折，嚴密，没有比較明暸的穖系统。關於演出，導演可説是過於平凡。</p>
<p>他不知道怎樣使全劇波折起伏，怎樣的逼近高潮。不必要而沉悶的塲面，盡量的使其多　，簡直不能刺激觀衆，提不起觀衆的精神。有幾個比較新頴的鏡頭，但是他却再三的重覆。穿揷了幾個笑料，也是呆笨得可以的，祗有那女人的哭泣，到還聰明。表演方面，除了李却亞倫（Ｒｉｃｈａｒｄ　Ａｒｌｅｎ）以外，其餘均無足取，不過也還敷衍得過去。　　然而本片也有值得注意的，便是攝影的可取。全部的畫面都是那樣明快清瞭，幾個夜間的鏡頭，也限精采。當然，燈光的靈活，在圖面中是很可以看得出來的。收音亦比較純凈，然而這原來就是美國片較爲特長的地方。</p>

<h3 id="c176">「女性的呐喊」總評 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 不徵白</p>
<p>「城市之夜」，「都會的早晨」之後，又來了「女性的呐喊」。當然這也是一張大片子，所以也有許多外來的評稿。申報電影專刋站在愛護國産影片的立塲上，很願意將琳瑯满目的來稿，盡量披露。很可惜的，我們篇幅有限，所以祇可擇其　之中肯者，摘錄若干，所以往往來稿洋千言，這　不過寥寥數語，或意無隻字披露，希閲愛護本刋者，多加以原諒。</p>
<p>不徵白</p>
<h3 id="c177">僅僅是一聲只喊 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 毅羣</p>
<p>我認爲缺憾的是在這故事中僅有一種前進的傾向，而還没有具體的積極的行動。因爲它的對象，僅僅在「呐喊」，僅僅在喊着「我們的前途呢」？雖然在字幕上也曾指示出「個人奮鬥是會失敗的，健實起來再奮鬥，」然而怎樣健實？怎樣合　？怎樣奮鬥？這裏一點也不曾解答出來。旣知病源而不寫藥方，結果只有使我們的　蓮作一名不知所終的駱駝而已。（事實是這樣）　　講到技巧，導演很有幾個小聰明的手法，譬如一個鳥籠在劇中穿揷了三次，而每次都有不同的意義，又如兩次汽笛的特寫和一面擦粉一面擦汗的對照，極經纃而且極合法，帮助劇情的刺激性不少。　　至於表演方面，王瑩尚見稱職，不過有幾處表現得太弱了（如父母死時，妹妹死時）這大槪是初上鏡頭膽小的綠故吧？龍稼農和顧梅君因爲戲少，所以看不出什麽破绽來，王吉亭和譚志遠满臉是戲，太賣弄了，其他的演員不好也不壤。　　總之「女性的呐喊」一步也不曾跳過題名之外，它僅僅是被壓迫女性的一聲呐喊。</p>
<h3 id="c178">向「呐喊」而呐喊 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 玉虹</p>
<p>當我們看到「女性的呐喊」的幾個字，就會使我們聯想到「河東獅吼」的幾個字，使一般具有季常癖的同志，會　觫得若無罪而就死。這是多樣威嚴的一個命名啊！　　不過當我們看過了説明書後，我們知道是誤會了，因爲這片中的「女性」是向黑暗社會而呐喊，並不是向我們「男性」挑戰，所以我們就安心的等候這位女性的示威呐喊！　　但是當我們看過了影片後，又使我們失望了，因爲這裏面祗有一葉被黑暗社會宰割與壓迫的懦弱女性，她們惟有屈服的心，悲哀的淚，並没有反抗的毅力與奮鬥的精神。能與我們一點事實上的指示的，也不過祗有葉蓮一人。而她的結局又是這樣的慘痛！　　這種痛苦與壓迫，我們隨時隨地都可以見得到的，固勿容影片來介紹。我們現在所要曉得的，是在這壓迫下的女性，應常怎樣的起來奮鬥與呐喊，在劇本方面應當給我們一條光明的路綫，與偉大的指示。若僅如此，未免辜負了這偉大的命名吧！</p>
<h3 id="c179">他説「很值得一看」 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 伍成</p>
<p>我看完後，影像還好。劇本也可以説是有相當的好處，但决不能説是充分的成功，因爲尚有幾處是不妥當，不深刻，不合現實的情節。像女學生輕易受騙，汽車肇禍的捕能輕易放過，和暴露貧苦女工的受二唇剝削時只在包飯作上用工夫；對於資本壓迫，却始終不曾有過一塲與一個號頭。導演更不如劇本，尤其是盜刦太兒戲馬虎。</p>
<p>说明都是加得非常得當，有幾句眞痛快。演員們都還賣力，不過飰飾葉運的王瑩表情太庸淺點，可是還在頭一次上鐘頭呢！王吉亭的動作，太隨便了點。譚志遠則和自由之花中，狂流中一樣的太過火。總之這張片子很值得一看。</p>
<h3 id="c180">關係「蝴蝶夫人」片内雙人東洋車的討論 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>十二日本刋載登禮垣君的一封信和凌鶴君的答覆，我覺得有不能肯定的地方，特地把這問題再提出討論一下。　　按「蝴蝶夫人」一片所取之時期及背景，係離今約二三十年以前，當日本尚在明治年代，禮垣君説曾在日本過了十餘年的孩童時代，未知是否明治年代？我雖然不敢自稱爲日本通，亦不曾仔細考察，過彼邦的歷史風俗，但是雙人座的東洋車，我的確曾經親眼看見過。這種車子起初是用木輪，到後來才用橡皮輪的。因爲坐兩人的原故，所以須一人拉一人推，方才拉得動。當那時候　即明治時代　女傭人偕着女公子或者兩個男人坐着這種車子是到處能夠看見的。那麽該片的作者對於日本的風俗能夠這樣細心考察是應該佩服的。我對於凌鶴君毫不細察而就武斷地否定，覺得是不應該的。</p>
<h3 id="c181">冷面滑稽不可再得矣 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>老牌冷面滑稽裴斯開登的作品，與卓别麟的作品相較，别有一種風味。尤其是和大鼻子先生傑美杜倫合演後的出品。最能使觀者看後如吃橄欖，饒有回味。然而不幸的消息傳來，裴斯開登已决定向米高梅公司辭職，並且决定此後脱離銀幕生活。眞是好萊塢的不幸，也是影迷們的不幸也。</p>
<p>裴斯開登在米高梅已有十年的歷史。他的早年是很不得名的起碼演員，入米高梅後便一帆風順，靠了他天然的陰陽怪氣配了一隻長面孔大眼睛，在無聲片時代裴斯開登的大名在歐美各國婦孺皆知，最歡迎他的片子的是英國。及至有聲片出而問世，裴斯開登曾一度失敗，後來在他和傑美村倫的大學敎授一片出世後，裴斯開登又能超出往日聲譽的趨勢，而不知現在爲何退休。米高梅的合同上尚有八個月遥日期，然裴斯開登願賠償其損失而以銷毀合同，可見其去志已决矣。</p>

<p>這時候，蕭伐洛夫，知道擁戴妲拉喀挪華公主的計盡已經敗露，他仍舊偷偷地溜回俄羅斯。奥洛夫已明白這套把戲，是蕭伐洛夫的主謀，但他也不便根究，怕事情一閙大，妲拉喀挪華公主就有性命之憂！他再一看好那一副嬌啼宛轉奄一息的樣兒，想起在意大利時候，天天偎傍着，間談着親愛，覺得心裏萬分的難受！然而悔已是來不及了！他從她的受罪上，又想着蕭伐洛夫，如果不是蕭伐洛夫，出了這個詭計，她怎會變成公主，又怎會受這一套　惡的毒刑？想着，他便設法去找了蕭伐洛夫來！　　奥洛夫對蕭伐洛夫説：「她現在已經懊悔了，所以我把她释放出來，你把她帶到波茜蒂公主那個修道院裏去，讓她知道一切的事情，免得她老是做着粉紅色的夢！」　　波茜蒂公主那個與世隔絶的修道院中，這一天來了一位和她面貎相似的少女，雖則面貎相似，可是兩個人的心性，却絶對的不同！波茜蒂公主那顆心，是冰一般的冷的是水一般的清：而妲拉喀挪華呢，她雖是受了無上　痛苦，然而仍是活　着，充满了新鮮的生命！直等到波茜蒂公主坐在她的身邊，軟軟地，温柔地，把經過的一切告訴她聽，她才明白自已祗是一個吉普西少女，什麽妲拉喀挪華公主，全是蕭伐洛夫玩的反戲！</p>
<p>她痛恨蕭伐洛夫，她寛恕了奥洛夫，她不知道怎樣才好！而波茜蒂公主，在絮叨叨告訴她之後，自已也覺得無限的悲哀，兩顆熱淚，從她的眼珠裏滴了下來！大家都是一樣零仃，一樣孤苦，不覺把她當做親生的姊妹一樣，可是妲拉喀挪華，已經不能像從前那樣活潑，而再唱那，人低徊的吉普西情歌了！（未完）</p>

<p>Ming</p>
<p>The arrest of six British engineers on suspicion of negligence in command and sabotage at the Soviet Sufjia factory has caused great friction between Britain and the Soviet Union. Trade between the two countries has been severely affected, even to the point of breaking off diplomatic relations. Although the cause is small, the result is very significant. World events are often like this. A bullet in Sarajevo triggered the First World War. Although the direct cause was very small, the accumulated explosive materials filled the world. From a superficial point of view, the conflict of interest between Britain and the Soviet Union is only the general appearance of a capitalist country versus a socialist country, and there seems to be no special incompatibility. However, a careful analysis of its content shows that the incompatibility between Britain and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly apparent in today's two opposing camps. Historical relations cannot be denied. We recall the fierce rivalry between Britain and Russia before the Russo-Japanese War, from Asia Minor along the Indian border to the Far East. Everywhere, a confrontational relationship was formed. Therefore, in the Russo-Japanese War, Britain did not hesitate to sacrifice its honorary isolation in Europe and form the Anglo-Japanese Alliance with Japan, trapping the Russian Baltic Fleet in an untenable situation. The completion of the Siberian Railway meant that the Far East market would be threatened by Russia, so it borrowed the power of Japan to deter its eastward advance.</p>
<p>Recently, after the Russian Revolution, its national foundation has become increasingly stable. The impact of the completion of the first five-year plan on the world has become more significant, and it has become particularly unsettling for the colony of India. In addition, the success of the Turkish railway will directly threaten India. How can the British not prepare for their own retreat? Moreover, the Soviet Union's westward world policy has been blocked, and it has turned eastward to find another way out in the Pacific. No matter where it is, it is closely related to the British Empire, or at least has a serious impact on British overseas markets or overseas investments. In general commercial competition and financial dominance, the Soviet Union is not a match for Britain and is far behind it. However, in the production of oil and the consumption of oil in Central Europe and the Far East market, the Soviet Union is indeed Britain's strong enemy. Moreover, the Soviet Union's oil reserves are extremely rich. With planned exploitation and planned dumping, it can not only control the price of oil in the Far East market, but also have a huge political impact. The temporary understanding between Japan and the Soviet Union is one example. Therefore, Britain cannot but borrow the power of Japan to defend the Soviet Union and maintain the stability of the Far East market and the control of India. Japan is using this weakness to provoke as much as possible, so that Britain and the Soviet Union will move away, so that it can invade the Northeast with the excuse of defending against the Red. The facts have been proven.</p>
<p>Let's not repeat the historical facts and analyze the international situation since the September 18th Incident to clarify the truth. The good name of justice and righteousness seems to have been won by our country, but the lost land is still under the trampling of the enemy's troops. Recovering the lost land by force has become a high-profile slogan, and resisting to the end is only a matter for our country. However, all political and military affairs in China in recent decades have been tied to international affairs. This kind of restriction has not been fundamentally lifted since the success of the Northern Expedition, and it is even more obvious since Japan began to invade the Northeast with force.</p>
<p>Since Japan has determined that our country's resistance is limited to local areas, it is implementing a strategy of defeating each one. Therefore, no matter how strong a troop is, if it lacks the support of the people of the whole country, it will be difficult to fight against the strong enemy. The imperialists also know that it is not easy to coordinate war debts, trade, and finance between Britain and the United States. Even if consultations are needed, it will take time. Britain and the Soviet Union are also not on good terms. Therefore, Japan can take advantage of this situation and use small-scale troops to provoke our army's front lines to achieve its trick of gradually eroding our country. At the same time, it is also using the name of the Boxer Protocol to request that Japanese troops be stationed along the Beining Railway. If this move can gain the understanding of Britain and our country does not immediately start fighting, Japan will take over Inner Mongolia and seize eastern Hebei, and threaten North China. At this time, the people of our country are very weak and it is impossible to sit still and wait for slaughter. However, the Far East market will also be destroyed from then on. Although Britain is old in diplomacy, it will inevitably be used by Japan.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 16th, specially appointing Song Zewen, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, to go to Washington to participate in economic discussions. This is the order. (Sixteenth Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the economic talks to be held in Washington, the Ministries of Finance and Industry originally planned to set up a special committee in advance to be responsible for drafting the principles. However, due to the tight schedule, it could not be established. According to the main points of the discussion, it is to stabilize the world economy, including war debts, reparations, tariffs, silver prices, etc. Our country's proposal policy is also nothing more than this. (1) Tariff issues: Although our country has achieved tariff autonomy, it is restricted by past treaties and lacks equality. Therefore, compared with other countries, our country's import tariff rates are lower by one or several times. The purpose of this meeting is to reduce tariff rates, which is of great concern to our country. Therefore, the historical status quo of our country's tariffs, the difference between the living prices of our people and the people of other countries, and the statistics of import and export goods must all be submitted for discussion, so that in the future, we can obtain mutually balanced treatment in import and export and trade with other countries. (2) Silver price issue: U.S. President Roosevelt has a proposal to raise silver prices and abolish the gold standard in the main agenda of this meeting. This is especially important to our country. Although our country has suffered from the rising gold price and cheap silver, according to the opinions of silver experts, there is not much silver in the country now. Once the silver price rises, the damage will not be small. Therefore, the government authorities anticipated the importance of this matter and repeatedly invited Minister Song to attend in order to seize the opportunity to deal with it. (3) War debt issue: Although our country has no major relationship, when the violent Japanese are particularly aggressively invading and plundering our country's tariffs, resulting in a sharp decrease in our income, directly affecting distant foreign debts and reparations to various countries, we must also make a careful statement to this meeting. (4) Our country must propose sanctions against the violent Japanese to uphold justice. Moreover, the main purpose of this meeting is to eliminate the world economic panic. To achieve this goal, we must first discuss stabilizing the world political situation, so that the people of all countries can live and work in peace. Therefore, this meeting must also seek a bright path for the Far East political situation in order to complete the mission of such a collection. The above four points are based on the main aspects. However, the scope of discussion of this meeting has not yet been clearly defined. Therefore, the preparation of the proposal can only be based on principles first. The specific measures should be responded to by the attending representatives as the situation changes. (Sixteenth Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the Washington Preparatory Conference is a great opportunity for the Japanese government to express itself after withdrawing from the League of Nations. The London World Economic Conference is an opportunity to break the world's economic downturn. It is now carefully discussing with Representative Ishii ways to eliminate the unsatisfactory situation between Japan and the United States on the Far East issue. The Japanese government is convinced that because Japan has severed ties with the League of Nations, no matter what the form of the Manchuria issue, it will never allow interference from third countries. Moreover, because Japan's policy toward Manchuria is indeed unchanged, Britain, France, and the United States will never raise this issue for discussion at the Washington Conference. However, the root cause of the current world unrest is not only due to the turmoil in the European economy, but also to the special situation in the Far East, which is quite clear. Therefore, Representative Ishii is ordered to explain to the new U.S. government Japan's position of maintaining peace in the Far East. Foreign Minister Uchida plans to discuss Japan's policy with Ishii for days before Ishii departs on May 4. According to Japanese authorities, there is no fundamental conflict of interest between Japan and the United States on the Far East issue, but the U.S.'s biased views on the Far East policy are mostly based on abstract political theories or emotional theories. Therefore, if Japan seriously explains the specific truth, it will surely gain the understanding of the United States, and it will not be difficult for Japan and the United States to shake hands.

<p>(Moscow) A report from Boli was published here today, stating that Japanese newspapers and White Russian newspapers in Manchuria have begun a rampant anti-Soviet movement, and are directly targeting the Soviet representatives of the Chinese Eastern Railway, accusing them of transporting locomotives of the Chinese Eastern Railway to the Soviet railway. The report stated that this movement is supported by Japanese officials from the (Manchukuo) Ministry of Transportation. Their provocative articles have repeatedly appeared in Japanese and White Russian newspapers. The Harbin Times wants to clarify that the locomotives in the dispute are not Soviet property, and its people advocate that (Manchukuo) and Japan should use strong measures to suppress the Soviet officials who are transferring these locomotives. Another Japanese named Shunwen from the Chinese Eastern Railway wrote an article in the Harbin Times, declaring that the locomotives do not belong to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet representatives should not have any objections. The Soviet government must return them, etc. The Soviet government's public bulletin (Yitufansi Tai) published an article today condemning this matter, stating that the anti-Soviet movement of Japanese newspapers and White Russian newspapers shows that certain adventurous elements in Manchuria are now attempting to obstruct the transportation of the Chinese Eastern Railway. This provocation is very obvious, because the locomotives in the dispute were collected and organized by the Soviet Union after the intervention of the great powers and transferred to the Chinese Eastern Railway. It is the property of the Soviet Union, which has been repeatedly declared by the Chinese Eastern Railway Administration and is considered to be undisputed. The newspaper pointed out that there was a similar movement in September of last year, which was stopped after explanations from the Soviet representatives and the Soviet Consul General in Harbin. As for the so-called Soviet representatives (stealing) Chinese Eastern Railway vehicles, the newspaper pointed out that there are currently more Soviet vehicles on the Chinese Eastern Railway than Chinese Eastern Railway vehicles on the Soviet railway. The newspaper concluded that the new Japanese officials leading this anti-Soviet movement (Man) have little to do with the interests of the Chinese Eastern Railway, because the road is the property of the Soviet Union and is placed under joint control. However, the Soviet people will pay the greatest attention to the disputes stirred up by these adventurous elements in the Far East, and they also hope that the Japanese government and public opinion can restrain these rampant adventurers, etc. (Sixteenth Dispatch from Tass)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Staff Officer Major General of the Kwantung Army Iso arrived in Dalian this morning at 8:00 a.m. aboard the Osaka Shosen Line ship America. Iso's trip is to participate in the Chiefs of Staff Conference to discuss countermeasures against the invasion of North China and the seizure of the Chinese Eastern Railway. In Shimonoseki, he told the Japanese press corps, "The military operation in Rehe has come to an end. The quick resolution of this operation was unexpected. The anti-Japanese Manchurian Volunteer Army, a large group in the four eastern provinces, has ended. Small groups in various places will still take a considerable amount of time to be wiped out. At this time, the British consulates and bank branches in Manchuria suddenly received orders from their home country to close and prepare to withdraw, which is puzzling. It is clear that they do not recognize the independence of (Manchukuo), which is very unfavorable to (Manchukuo), but Britain itself will also suffer losses in the future. The Chinese Eastern Railway is even more complicated. My trip is to participate in the National Chiefs of Staff Conference. The countermeasures against Russia in Manchuria and the countermeasures against North China in the future will also be earnestly discussed with the government."

(2) The Third Fleet is responsible for the security of the Yangtze River basin, and especially seriously guards against anti-Japanese actions.

The Textile Federation's interpretation of the abolition issue is roughly as follows: (1) Request the government to take active action to set the exchange rate tariff to the minimum limit. (2) Not buying Indian cotton is one way to protest, but the silk elephant must be discarded and further discussed at the meeting on the 18th. (3) Unite traders with India to continue the protest movement. (4) Depending on the level of the exchange rate tariff, the fundamental change in the textile industry's warning method is a major issue.

<p>The entire case has been tried once, with a hearing scheduled for the 20th</p>
<p>The case of Chen Duxiu and other Trotskyite communist leaders endangering the Republic of China began to be tried publicly by the Jiangsu High Court, sitting in the Criminal Court of the Jiangning District Court, on the 14th. On the 14th, Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, Pu Yifan, Wang Wu, and other four people were separately summoned for questioning. At 10 AM on the 15th, the trial continued. First, the written records of Chen and the other four were checked, and then the six defendants in the same case, Wang Ziping and others, were questioned. The court adjourned at 3:15 PM. The audience was still very crowded. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e53">Reading Yesterday's Records <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>At 9:55 AM, Hu Shanbai, the presiding judge of the case, along with judges Zhang Bingci and Lin Zhemin, prosecutor Zhu Xie, clerk Shen Yuren, and others, ascended the courtroom. The defense lawyers for the defendants, Zhang Shizhao, Peng Wangye, Wu Zhiping, Jiang Haoshi, Liu Zuwang, and others, successively entered the courtroom. The clerk announced that the trial of Chen Duxiu for endangering the Republic of China would continue today. The judge then stated that the records of yesterday's trial of Chen and others had been organized and should be checked by the defendants in court. Chen Duxiu was then ordered to be brought to the court, and the clerk read the record aloud. (That is, the main points of Chen's confession were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Chen stood quietly listening. After the reading, Chen stated that it was generally the same as yesterday's confession, with only slight corrections regarding the Red Army section in the fourth volume of "Anti-Spark" and the section on "Reddening." He added that the original wording in the record was not appropriate and slightly deviated from the original meaning, but this was not my political thought and did not seem to be of great importance. At this time, Peng Wangye, the defense lawyer for the defendant, stood up and stated that a section was slightly missing from the record regarding Chen's confession about alternate Central Committee member Pu Yifan. Chen had confessed that the alternate Central Committee member was Pu Yifang, a Sichuanese, over thirty years old, with a very dark complexion, while the Pu Yifan seen today has a fair complexion and is very young, not the same Pu Yifang, etc. These statements were not recorded and should be added. The clerk then added the corrected points one by one. The judge ordered Chen to return to his seat in the defendant's row, and then ordered Peng Shuzhi to be brought in. The clerk checked the record, which Peng generally acknowledged, but said that he was expelled from the party in 1929, and regarding the Red Army and the so-called Three Revolutions, he had made some statements. He had not divided his reasons for opposing the National Government into three points: foreign, domestic, and the suffering of the people, and asked to re-narrate them for a supplement. The lawyer also stood up and stated that there were omissions in Peng's confession. Peng confessed that regarding the point about alternate Central Committee members, "Ning Fengchun is imprisoned, how can someone imprisoned be elected as an alternate Central Committee member," but the description in the record was slightly unclear and should also be supplemented and corrected. Chen and Peng's confession records were the longest. Just the reading and correction took an hour. Then the records of Pu Yifan and Wang Wu (Song Fengchun) were checked, with no significant corrections, which was completed in about a quarter of an hour.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Wang and He Admit to Being Communists <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(1) Wang Ziping: At 11:10 AM, Wang Ziping was interrogated. According to his confession, he is Wang Ziping, also known as Zeng Meng, from Wenzhou, Zhejiang. He joined the party in 1927 and was sent to study in Russia in the same year, attending Sun Yat-sen University. He later returned to China due to illness. At that time, the Chinese Communist Party did not have a Trotskyite faction name, but in Russia, many Chinese party members had this tendency. After returning to China, some people were expelled from the party. Because I (Wang referring to himself below) had friendly relations with them, I was suspected by the cadres. In the spring of 1929, I was also expelled from the party, but I did not join the Trotskyite faction. Since then, I have been unemployed. I lived in Zhabei. The Battle of Shanghai in January 28th last year destroyed Zhabei, making me even more destitute. Then I met Peng Shuzhi and he asked me to take on writing, providing monthly support for living. Then on September 23rd, I moved to 335 Yeguang Lane, Tangshan Road, and lived with He Afang, helping to print the two periodicals "Spark" and "School Life." The manuscripts were brought by Xie Shaoshan, printing about 250 copies each issue, printing it and handing it to Xie Shaoshan, saying those magazines were all Trotskyite propositions, but I did not know Chen Duxiu. I only did the printing work for the Trotskyites, and I don't know anything else. I was arrested on the evening of October 16th. At that time, we were living in the hall of that house, printing "Spark" magazine, and were arrested by the police. All the original documents of the printed materials were checked and searched by the police. (2) He Afang: At 11:30 AM, the judge ordered He Afang to be interrogated. According to her confession, her other name is He Zhiwei, from Ruian, Zhejiang. She joined the Communist Party in 1927. In September of the same year, she was sent to Russia, first studying at the Eastern University and then at Sun Yat-sen University for three years. She was expelled from the party before graduating and deported back to China. She worked as a coppersmith in a machine shop in Shanghai. Last September 23, at the invitation of Xie Shaoshan, she moved to 335 Yeguang Lane and lived with Wang Ziping. During the day, I went to work at the factory, and sometimes I helped with printing "Spark" and other magazines in the evening. On the evening of October 16th, it was still the first time to print "Spark," and while printing, I was arrested before it was finished. I (He referring to herself below) never printed "School Life." I have never printed "Spark" before. After being arrested, all the sundries in the room (including clothes and printed matter) were searched. Xie Shaoshan introduced me to Yeguang Lane. I don't know Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, and Peng's wife Chen Guixian. The records of my confession at the police station on October 17th were not accurate. Xie Shaoshan called me to do the printing, giving me twenty yuan each time. I don't know much about the other things.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Wang Zhaoye and Others Deny Involvement <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>(1) Wang Zhaoye: He confessed that he was from Suxian, Anhui. He graduated from the Fourth Normal School in Anhui Province. He then studied at Southeast University for one year and then went to Beiping. He previously held a teaching position at the Hubei High School in E Province, with a monthly salary of eighty yuan. He resigned and came to Beijing because the principal was replaced. He found a job through Li Sichang, an employee of Central University, who introduced him to Xie Shaoshan in Shanghai. He lived in Xie's house and was arrested with Peng Shuzhi and others on October 15. He does not know Peng and others, and does not know it is a communist organization. When arrested, I was reading a movie magazine. Peng and others were reading and talking. I do not know whether they were arrested for being Kaifeng. To this day, I still don't understand why I was arrested. I don't know anything about the report of Detective Godard of the police station. After asking this, the judge asked, "You are a teacher, an intellectual, can't you see the traces of those people, isn't it known as a communist agency?" Also, where their agencies are located, if you are not a member of the party, why would they accept a stranger to live together?" Wang replied that he did not know that the place was a Communist Party agency. He also didn't know why they would take him, and did not recognize Chen Duxiu, only reading his articles in magazines. (2) Guo Jinghao: According to his confession, he is twenty-one years old, also named Peng Daozhi, from Baoqing, Hunan, and is Peng Shuzhi's younger brother. He studied at Shanghai Labor University for one semester. Later, he was closed down. I did not join the Communist Party. I heard that Shuzhi was. On October 17, I was arrested looking for Zhou Bosheng (transliteration) at 335 Yeguang Lane, Tangshan Road. I was looking for him to borrow money for rent. There was a policeman guarding the door, and he arrested me. I changed my name to Guo Jinghao because my brother is a famous Communist Party member. I don't know why I was arrested. When asked this, the presiding judge mentioned the three characters for changing the school registration form. Guo replied, "I cannot admit that the school registration form is my evidence of crime." "I don't know the source of the form. It was not found where I live." "The form said that I joined the Communist Party in Changsha in 1925. I have never been to Changsha. Please join the opposition in 1929, I haven't been to Shanghai yet. I arrived in Shanghai in the spring of the nineteenth year, and was admitted to Laoda in the spring of the twentieth year. The form was fabricated by the public security." (3) Liang Youguang: According to his confession, he is thirty-three years old, from Guilin, Guangxi. I have never joined the Communist Party. I was arrested at Sun Jingkuan's (transliteration) home on Daitong Road on October 16. I live in his house because he is a friend of my brother Liang Youming. I used to do gold and silver jewelry business at home. I didn't arrive in Shanghai until October 1. I went to Sun's house on the 14th. At 11:00 a.m. on the 16th, the police knocked on the door. The whole house was unexpectedly shocked for unknown reasons. Sun jumped out of the window. I didn't know what was going on. I thought an accident had happened and wanted to climb to the neighboring room to escape. I missed and fell down. I didn't run away from the reactionary books. I don't know. I'm not the landlord. I can't be responsible for anything. I just came. The landlord can also testify that I am a provincial investigator of the Trotskyite group, and there is no evidence. Except for Sun Jingkuan, I don't know Luo Sifan and Xie Shaoshan. (4) Wang Jiantang, his confession generally stated that he was from Shandong, twenty-eight years old, lived at 22 Fulili, Shanghai, and owned a tobacco shop. His family lived in the shop. He had never joined the Communist Party. Some of the reactionary books that were searched were from the previous tenant of the upper floor. He went out that day and had not returned by night. He was arrested that night. The former tenant claimed to be Wang Boping (transliteration) and said he worked at the municipal government. The tenants in the back building had a small amount of vegetables. What I confessed to the police station before about the reactionary books was another matter, because there used to be a Mr. Xue working as an accountant in my store. He went to Putuo in July last year. He owed me twenty-one yuan and put the wooden box as a mortgage when he left. I didn't know what was inside until I was arrested, and the police opened the wooden box and found out that it was a reactionary book. Because they searched for the books of the previous tenant and the books of the Xue's, they pointed out that I was a communist, which is indeed unjust. Please ask the court to investigate whether Yu Zhijing's confession is true, and it can be judged whether he is related to the case. However, Gu Guan's image is not like a Communist Party member.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Chen and Peng Interrogated Again <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>At 12:45 PM, after separate interrogations, the presiding judge recalled Chen, Peng, Wang and Pu. He first asked Chen Duxiu what the ultimate goal of the Trotskyite faction was. (Chen replied), "It is the world proletarian government." (Asked), "Isn't it to overthrow the National Government?" (Answer) "Of course." Then ask Peng Shuzhi what the ultimate goal of the Trotskyite faction is? (Peng replied), it is the world proletarian revolution.</p>
<p>Re-summon Wang Wu. (The official asked), "Your name is involved in the testimonial, saying that you attended the second regular meeting. Is that true?" The court then handed the document to Wang to read. (Wang replied), "This manuscript, first of all, is in terms of time, it is still a 1930s publication, and it has nothing to do with my affairs on October 15th last year. And in terms of the meaning of the entire text, it scolds me. It is politically attacking me. In the same publication, perhaps I can find the announcement of my dismissal. If this can be used as legal evidence, then it can be used as my refutation." Re-summon Pu Yifan. (The official asked) Are you from Anhui or Sichuan? (Answer) You can tell by listening to me speak. (Asked), "Where were you arrested?" (Answer), "At Xie Shaoshan's house in Chunyangli." (Asked), "Are you a Communist candidate?" (Answer) "I don't understand. I studied literature at Waseda University in Japan. I know things like moon, flowers, and sister I love you, but I don’t know anything else.”</p>
<h3 id="e57">Court Set for Another Hearing <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>From the opening of the court to the completion of the questioning, it took more than three hours for a portion of the entire case to be examined. Thereupon, the judge declared that the case had been examined once. Tomorrow happens to be the regular weekly holiday, and the day after tomorrow is needed to organize the records. It is now scheduled for another hearing on the 18th (i.e., Tuesday). Subsequently, the defendant's lawyer stated that the court would need time to gather all the evidence and summon witnesses, which might not be completed within a very short period, and requested an extension of the hearing. The judge then rescheduled the court hearing to the morning of the 20th, without issuing another notice. At that time, it was already 1:15 PM, and the court was adjourned. The one thousand defendants were still returned to the detention center. The five lawyers representing the defendant in the defense, Zhang Shi Jian, Wu Zhi Ping, etc., are all practicing in Shanghai. The case was being heard in Beijing, so they came to Beijing from Shanghai to appear in court. Because the court will not reopen until the 20th, they will depart from Beijing by train at 3:20 PM on the 15th.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Recent Situation of Defense Corps Training in Various Districts <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Our county's Defense Corps, since starting the general training in early February in accordance with provincial orders, the three-month training period is about to expire. Previously, the County Defense Committee sent personnel to inspect and verify that some districts had dropouts and absentees. Due to the training results, the level may not be consistent. Regarding this point, the leaders of the County Defense Committee have decided that the training period must still end at the end of April. Those who have not completed the training courses will be left to make up for them during the agricultural slack season, which has been circulated on record. However, there are still Corps members who are evading training under various pretexts. They are also ordered to gather the required number before the 25th of this month, with the assistance of the local public security sub-bureaus. If they still resist, they will be punished according to Article 21 of the Provisional Reward and Punishment Rules of the Defense Corps of various counties in Jiangsu Province, and district leaders will be ordered to submit a list for review. As for the funding of the Defense Corps, it was previously proposed to collect a defense donation. After the provincial office approved the record, the district was also ordered to investigate separately. It has already been completed. Once the party committee completes the review, the collection will begin immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Yu Tan's Speech <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Today, our ministry is holding a national railway-related product exhibition and lecture. The significance and general situation of our ministry's cargo exhibition have been disclosed repeatedly in the newspapers. You must already understand. The only customers of the national railway are the various trade associations. The number of goods entrusted by various trade associations to the railway for transportation each year is very large. According to the statistics of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the total tonnage transported nationwide throughout the year was more than 20 million tons, and the total freight was more than 72 million yuan. We are entrusted with such a large business and trusted with such a large responsibility by our railway. This responsibility is to deliver the goods of various commercial firms to their destination. Although this responsibility is very short in time on the railway, in the past, the ability of our railway staff to handle affairs was still very immature. In many places, we feel very ashamed. We can say that we have not yet fulfilled our railway responsibility. Because the railway's responsibility is not only transportation, but also to promote the ability of the agricultural, industrial, and commercial industries along the railway to increase production and promote their development. This is the real purpose of the railway. Therefore, the construction of the railway was originally for the development of all industries in the country. To achieve this goal, we should make the people of the country get all kinds of conveniences. Because of this, our ministry brought the samples of products produced along the national railway to Shanghai for the first national railway-related product exhibition. Although this time, the samples are not many, but it is the first time in the 30 years of the national railway to do it. Now it is considered to be done. We have also tried our best to collect the products from various places and investigate the production, sales, and transportation of various goods as much as possible. We hope that the various commercial firms in Shanghai can study in detail, be able to guide the production capacity of various places, the method of transportation, and the ability of sales, and compare various samples in detail. This way, the business policy of each commercial firm can be determined in the future. This is the most important reason for the railway-related cargo exhibition. There are two most important products along the railway. The first is the mine product. According to the statistics of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the tonnage of the mine product nationwide was more than 13 million, and the total freight was more than 25 million. The second is agricultural products, which is food. According to the statistics of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the tonnage was more than 3.4 million tons, and the freight was more than 20 million yuan. These two are the railway's most important customers. The second is industrial products. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, there were more than 3 million tons, and the freight was more than 19 million yuan. The number of other goods is very small. However, these three important goods, from the railway's point of view, are still in a very immature stage and need to be fully improved and vigorously promoted. Because the traffic in various places is very inconvenient, and other aspects feel very difficult, so most merchants have no way to go to various places to investigate. We even have no way to know many of our country's products. Taking this opportunity today, everyone can refer to it in detail. As for the most closely related to the merchants in Shanghai, it is the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. We look at the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. According to the statistics of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the tonnage of goods was more than 1 million tons, and the freight was more than 1.8 million yuan. Among them, the largest number is the mining product. Its tonnage is 460,000 tons, and the freight is 660,000 yuan. The secondary is industrial products. The whole year is more than 380,000 tons, and the freight is more than 770,000 yuan. This situation is slightly different from the national statistics. Because Shanghai is a very developed place for industrial products, the estimated composition is slightly more than other roads. Other products such as forests and mines are estimated at a very small number. The total annual freight tonnage of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is more than 800,000 tons, and the freight is more than 1.4 million yuan. The most important thing here is industrial products. Its tonnage is 300,000 tons and 220,000 tons, and the freight is 100,000 yuan. The rest are very small numbers. Our ministry is in the process of earnest consolidation of the two roads. Now Director Huang and Deputy Director Wu are working hard to thoroughly improve, hoping to live up to your expectations. As for what we hope from you, first, although running the railway is nominally a state-owned enterprise, it should not have the bureaucratic habits of an ordinary yamen to affect the progress of our business. Perhaps there are some unscrupulous people among our railway colleagues. We hope that you will supervise them as much as possible. Because the railway should be commercialized, various commercial firms should not be troubled because it is a yamen. If you break through this point, then the relationship between various commercial firms and us in the future will be like the business between merchants. If we have something wrong, you can treat us with the attitude of dealing with colleagues, blame us, and make us correct it immediately. Then, the railway industry will have a way, and the business of various commercial firms will also have a way. I also know that in the past, the various corrupt places of the railway, such as carriage fee, hanging fee, refueling fee, and other kinds of malpractices, were not only the fraud of the railway staff, but also the collusion of unscrupulous merchants. Because they only covet the current interests, they are also forced by various difficult circumstances, so they add one or more times the freight to the prescribed freight. Because of your business relationship, you have to endure it painfully. However, the railway itself has not benefited from this extra money, and you have increased many burdens. It can be said that the railway has not fulfilled its railway responsibility, and it can also be said that you have not fulfilled your supervision responsibility. Our ministry is very willing to ask you to work hard to supervise, so that the railway and passengers can cooperate together. (2) We also hope that you will understand the railway. Now our ministry has fundamentally reformed the previous railway situation. The railway has never been responsible for goods. You can come if you want, and we don't care if you don't want to come. We can not be responsible for transporting goods, losing them, damaging them, stealing them. This situation is not seen on railways all over the world. It can be said that it is the biggest problem of Chinese railways. Therefore, our ministry advocated responsible transportation last year. Responsible transportation is to sincerely serve the various commercial firms. Perhaps some people think that we are doing responsible transportation to add 10% freight. In fact, this is a fundamental misunderstanding. Because the freight paid by the passengers in the past often exceeded the regulations by one or two times, the 10% added now can be said to be very little, and the passengers can be exempted from this one or two times the burden. Our railway is to seek happiness for the public, not to make money. Although we do not hope to lose money, we must also do it where there are losses. You must know that we are responsible for transportation, that is, to ask the passengers to come directly to the railway to transport goods, with fewer middlemen, then the burden of the passengers can certainly be reduced by many burdens, so please recognize this point. (3) Although the railway is a state-owned institution, its purpose is to develop the people's production capacity, increase the amount of agricultural, industrial, and commercial production, improve the previous immature situation, promote industry, agriculture, and commerce, and assist him to make him develop. For example, our ministry has been charging four times as much for first-class goods for the past year, then changed to four times as much for second-class goods, and now the four times have been canceled and only second-class freight is charged. Others such as pottery, kiln goods, coarse grains, salt, agricultural seeds, fresh mulberry vegetables, dried seafood, fish seeds, various plants, gold ore, sand, are reduced by one or two grades, domestic match finished products are reduced by four grades, Tanggu Yongli salt is reduced by six grades and 75%, raw materials produced by Chinese-funded factories, Shandong needle factory, Shanghai Tianyuan electrochemical factory are reduced by one grade, Shanghai Shenxin, Yong'an textile, Jiujiang Jiuxing textile, cotton second cloth, are all reduced grades, coal, grain, tea, vegetables, wool, porcelain, coarse paper are set at the same price. In short, we aim to meet the needs of various industries as the standard, and try our best to help increase production capacity. (4) I hope that today we can promote the cooperation between the railway and merchants, so we railway held this exhibition, to gather the samples of goods from all over the country together, so that everyone can refer to them in detail. This exhibition is the starting point of the road-commerce cooperation. Our railway still has many places to be improved. Please do not hesitate to give us advice, so that we can reduce the burden of various commercial firms, which is also fulfilling a part of our railway's responsibility. Next, please Mr. Tan talk about the procedures that the agricultural, industrial, and commercial circles need to know when transporting goods by railway.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Tan Yaozong's Speech <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Tan Yaozong, Assistant of the Business Department of the Railway Ministry, spoke about the procedures that the industrial and commercial circles need to know when transporting goods by railway, saying that the railway business has two types: passenger transport and freight transport. In the past, the railway authorities did not pay attention to freight transport. The decline of the railway business was inevitable. However, the underdevelopment of industry and commerce had a great impact on the social economy. Therefore, the Railway Ministry, in view of this, immediately planned to rectify and implement responsible transportation. In August last year, it participated in the examples of various countries and formulated all the regulations. In September, it was promulgated and implemented, gradually extending from the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Jinpu, and other railways to various railways. There are 14 railways in Guannei. Currently, only three railways, Ping Sui and Guang Shao, have not been implemented. The other eleven railways have been implemented in order, and the results are remarkable, which is convenient for passengers and merchants. The procedures are reported as follows: Freight transport is divided into chartered cars and consignment. Except for the slight difference in charges, the procedures are the same, and they are very simple, divided into three steps: (1) packaging, (2) consignment, (3) pick-up. Freight rates are charged in six grades. Therefore, when packaging, passengers and merchants must pack the goods of each grade separately. The wooden boxes or wrapping paper used must be strong to avoid loss or damage. It is best to add paper seals along the mouth, and the packing must be neat and tight, which can not only save space but also avoid the damage during loading and unloading. After packaging, send it to the railway bureau, fill in the consignment note, fill in the name, number of pieces, weight, name and address of the consignee and the case person, hand it over to the railway bureau staff to weigh, and fill in the freight, the railway bureau will issue a receipt waybill, responsible for transporting it to the consignee at the destination, without any other expenses. In case of loss or damage, the railway bureau will be fully responsible for compensation. However, what should be paid attention to when chartering a car is that all the goods must be loaded within 24 hours to avoid delay. When the goods arrive at the destination, the railway bureau will immediately notify the consignee to pick them up. If it exceeds one day, a storage fee and a storage fee will be charged. The fee is very low, only 2.5 points for every 50 kilograms of first-class goods. The price of car transport and parcel transport is now 1 to 2 on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, and 1 to 1.75 on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. Because the procedures for sending parts by mail are more complicated, the charges are higher. However, the railway is now planning to reform, in order to reduce the difference between the two as much as possible. As for the freight, it can be paid at the time of departure or collected after delivery. This method has been implemented on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, and the Jinpu Railway will also implement it soon, which is also to facilitate passengers and merchants. Since the implementation of responsible transportation, all parties have faith in it, so the bank can also release funds to mortgage. The Railway Ministry has also set a method to facilitate merchants, so that merchants can make profits by transferring, and the social economy can also be prosperous.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Huang Boqiao and Others' Speeches <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Huang Boqiao, director of the two railway bureaus, said in his speech that the principle of politics is to seek the welfare of the masses. The government spends hundreds of millions of dollars to build railways or dredge waterways for this purpose. My country's railways have a long history, but they do not aim to serve the people, which has led to bureaucratic habits. The National Government was established to improve this situation and eliminate all long-standing malpractices. I hope that all sectors will report them at any time and urge them to do so. Deputy Director Wu Shaozeng said in his speech that the implementation of responsible transportation is convenient for all sectors, but its freight rates still need to be improved. For example, dividing all goods into six grades seems to be unfair in terms of their affordability. Therefore, I ask the Railway Ministry to modify it immediately and charge in ten grades. For the length of the journey, I hope that there will be no difference in charges, so that the products of all places can get the convenience of equal freight rates and the opportunity to compete in the same market. The indirect impact can make the citizens get cheaper goods.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association published Feng Bingnan's reply to Yan Fangjun's letter, and the numbers in the second point of his point-by-point answer were copied incorrectly due to a clerical error.

<h3 id="e86">Li Liejun Delivers Speech on Opening Up Political Power <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Military and Pro-Communism Propaganda Only Subject to Censorship</p>
<p>The Provisional National Congress Will Be the Final Conclusion of Representing Public Opinion</p>
<p>Central Committee member Mr. Li Liejun visited Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to inquire about his illness and discuss the issue of opening up political power. He then visited Central Committee member Li Shizeng but did not find him. Mr. Li then delivered a speech at his private residence on Rue Massenet, as follows: "My visit to Mr. Wang was to inquire about his illness, but the affairs of the state are serious, so naturally, a detailed discussion was necessary. What the whole country is currently focused on is the willingness to open up political power, actively resist Japan, and thoroughly suppress the communists. All three matters should be actively pursued. Recently, Mr. Li Genyuan, Mr. Chu Fucheng, Mr. Zhao Fengchang, Mr. Sun Hongyi, Mr. Zhang Yaozeng, and the National Salvation Joint Association sent a telegram to the Central Government, which the government takes very seriously and will respond to sincerely by telegram. The matters stated in the two telegrams are mostly the same. Freedom of organization inherently includes the freedom of assembly and association. However, in recent years, there have been no other political parties besides the Kuomintang, hence the explicit regulations. The government has already issued a circular to protect the freedoms of assembly, association, speech, and publication. Our country's law on the organization of people's organizations has not yet been abolished, so organizing groups is extremely inconvenient. However, the abolition of this law will also have to wait until the National Congress. This convening of a provisional National Congress is a necessary procedure for opening up political power. As for the censorship of speech and publication, it would be inconvenient to completely abolish it now, given the fierce battles in the front lines and the prevention of communist propaganda. However, the Central Government has already instructed all localities to ensure that censorship is limited only to military and pro-communist propaganda. If all localities can strictly comply, then speech and publication will be more convenient. As for resisting Japan and suppressing the communists, the social sector greatly hopes that the nation's talents can be concentrated to jointly support the effort. Therefore, the telegram from Yin Quan and others suggests expanding the Central Government's organization and expanding the organizational structure of the military and political organs in Beiping. This matter is also of great importance. Currently, some people in the Central Government are drafting concrete measures, which should be discussed in the coming days to promote their success and ensure that the ability to resist Japan and suppress the communists is effectively enhanced." Mr. Li then added, "There are those who oppose this opening up of political power. However, domestic opinions can be divided into three types: one is those with political motives, the second is those who are enthusiastically patriotic but do not have a clear understanding of the government, and the third is those who are enthusiastically patriotic and have a very clear understanding of the government. However, our standard for selection cannot be based on the opinions of a minority of people; we must base our standard on the will of the majority of the people to avoid being limited by bias. There is one point about the National Congress that is currently misunderstood by many outsiders, which I should explain. What is it? This National Congress is a necessary step for opening up political power and is also the last time it will represent the will of the people. After this Congress, the representation of public opinion will come to an end, and subsequent meetings will be effective only within the party, so that the boundaries between public opinion organs and the Kuomintang are clearly defined. Therefore, those who suspect that convening the congress is inappropriate have not paid attention to this point." He concluded, "My blood pressure is still high, and the date of my trip to Nanjing has not yet been decided."</p>
<h3 id="e87">Jiang-Zhejiang Silk Cocoon Associations Petition the Ministry of Finance for Silk Cocoon and Silk Relief <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Exemption of All Surcharges on Dry Cocoons and Allocation of Funds to Subsidize Silk Exports</p>
<p>The Jiang-Zhejiang Silk Cocoon Trade Association Joint Council, in view of the dumping of Japanese silk and the squeeze on Chinese silk, petitioned the National Government's Ministry of Finance for relief, requesting that all surcharges on dry cocoons be exempted and that a portion of the tax increase on artificial silk be allocated to subsidize silk exports. The original text is recorded on the left:</p>
<h3 id="e88">Abolish Surcharges <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of requesting the exemption of all taxes and levies to rescue the declining cocoon industry: Upon investigation, the dumping of Japanese silk has squeezed Chinese silk. The raw silk cocoons stockpiled in Shanghai warehouses are still piled high like mountains. Cocoon merchants have suffered losses year after year, with debts accumulating. They all regard the purchase of cocoons as a long journey. The silkworm season this year will be turning. If measures are not taken early, there will be no one to buy the cocoons, and farmers holding cocoons will have nowhere to sell them. They will inevitably rot and be abandoned, harming the rural economy to a great extent. The only way to ensure smooth sales of cocoons is to first reduce the cost of cocoons. However, as silkworm cocoons are essential to farmers' livelihoods, the purchase price should not be too low. In addition to petitioning your ministry to subsidize the export of raw silk with a portion of the tax increase on artificial silk, thereby raising the price of cocoons, we respectfully request that you still issue a general order exempting all taxes and levies related to the cocoon industry, such as stove taxes, business taxes, stamp taxes, construction surcharges, and various local benefit taxes, so as to reduce costs and compete with Japan, allowing the nearly extinct silk cocoon industry to be revived, the rural economy to be saved, and the bankruptcy of merchants to be avoided. The general public will know that the government is actively assisting, and it is hoped that more cocoon shops can be established. Otherwise, farmers will have no way to sell their cocoons, and the future of sericulture will be even more bleak. All requests to exempt all taxes and levies on the cocoon industry are submitted below. We respectfully request that your ministry approve and implement them as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Subsidize Exports <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of requesting that the tax revenue from the tax increase on artificial silk be allocated to subsidize the export of raw silk, thereby raising the price of cocoons and maintaining the rural economy: Upon investigation, Japanese silk is being sold at low prices, and Chinese silk cannot gain a foothold in the European and American markets. As a result, the price of silk has fallen from over 1,200 taels per picul to just over 400 taels. The price of cocoons has also plummeted. In 1930, native fresh cocoons could be sold for over 70 yuan per picul. Last year, they were sold for only 20 yuan, a drop of three-quarters. Farmers have suffered greatly. According to farm households, raising one picul of cocoons requires feeding 18 piculs of mulberry leaves. Even if we calculate based on self-cultivated mulberry trees, each picul costs at least one yuan, totaling 18 yuan for mulberry leaves. Adding the cost of silkworm eggs at three yuan, plus repairing silkworm rearing equipment, purchasing firewood, etc., if each picul costs 30 yuan, it barely covers the cost of materials, and there is no allowance for the cost of rearing silkworms. Now, selling for 20 yuan means losing money. Last year, families raising silkworms suffered great losses, and some even chopped down their mulberry trees, vowing never to raise silkworms again. Farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang rely entirely on the income from silkworm rearing to subsidize their farming. If they all chop down mulberry trees and abandon silkworm rearing, not only will the country lose a major source of production, but the rural economy will inevitably go bankrupt, with no hope of recovery. This will cause the decline of all industries on a small scale and affect public security on a large scale. If prompt relief is not provided, the hidden dangers will spread uncontrollably. To seek relief, raising the price of cocoons is the only way to succeed. The tax increase on artificial silk was originally approved at the request of various public groups to provide relief to silk cocoons. Now that your ministry has implemented it, using the revenue from the tax increase to subsidize the export of raw silk is extremely appropriate. We should request that the tax revenue from the tax increase on artificial silk be allocated to the Ministry of Industry as a special fund for storage, to be used permanently for maintaining silk cocoons, so that manufacturers can gain this guarantee and dare to slightly increase the price of cocoons and boldly purchase cocoons. This is the only way to solve the urgent problem. Therefore, we urgently petition your ministry to implement it decisively. The livelihoods of rural areas and the safety of silk cocoons depend entirely on this. Respectfully submitted. The water fee for this extra use of water should be calculated based on the class of the house. For houses with the lowest rent, it is 1.71 cents per thousand gallons, and for houses with the highest rent, it is 7.5 cents per thousand gallons.</p>

<p>He Has Already Moved Into the Hospital for Treatment</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zhiben, Deputy Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, came to Shanghai yesterday for medical treatment and telegraphed President Sun of the Legislative Yuan to resign. After receiving the telegram, Sun replied to him with words of consolation. Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, he sent Liang Hancao, the Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, to Mr. Zhang's residence to persuade him to stay and complete the draft of the constitution so that it could serve as a guideline for the implementation of constitutional government. In the afternoon, Mr. Zhang visited Mr. Sun at his residence on Columbia Road, expressing that his old illness (stomach disease) had not healed and that he could not overcome the difficulties. He firmly requested that other talents be sought so that he could rest. According to a reporter from the Far East News Agency who went to Mr. Zhang's residence, Mr. Zhang's intention to resign was quite firm. His previous trip to Beijing to take on the task of drafting the constitution was at the repeated invitation of President Sun. He refused many times, but to no avail. Now, due to the recurrence of his stomach illness, doctors say that it will be difficult to achieve results without effective treatment. Therefore, after visiting Mr. Sun this afternoon, he moved into the hospital. The reporter saw that his attitude was negative and did not inquire further about the question of returning to work.</p>

<p>Report on Repelling the Japanese Army in Dongning</p>
<p>Liang Detang and Zhang Chuyu, representatives of Wang Delin, Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin National Salvation Army, received a telegram from the front lines stating that ammunition and clothing were extremely lacking and requesting assistance from all sectors. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Righteous Army Support Association requesting assistance. (Respected Sirs: We have just received a telegram from our Acting Commander-in-Chief Wu stating that our Liu unit engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy in Dongning on March 16 and achieved a great victory, soon recovering the county. Order is normal. It is estimated that over 100 enemies were killed, and our army suffered over 30 casualties. They are still continuing to fight and making progress. However, ammunition, clothing, and other items are severely lacking. Relying solely on hand-to-hand combat cannot last. Now that the enemy is weak and has no time to look east, it is the time for us to risk our lives and make contributions. The opportunity is urgent and must not be missed. We beg you to ask all sectors to provide assistance. Sincerely, etc." A copy is attached for your review. We respectfully request that your association provide strong assistance to achieve the merit of killing the enemy and avoid missing the opportunity and regretting it later.

<h3 id="e92">Shanghai Discusses Building a Public Cemetery for War Dead <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the remains of officers and soldiers who died in the January 28th Incident last year, apart from a portion that was exhumed by personnel sent by the Central Government to Shanghai and transported to the capital for burial, the remaining remains were hastily buried on the spot at the time due to the urgency. However, the coffins were thin and of poor quality, and they were buried together in one place, covered with thin soil. As a result, just over a year later, they have been eroded by wind and rain, and the soil has been washed away, gradually exposing the coffins. Therefore, they are scattered along the Jiaotong Road in Zhenru, Dazhili, and the roadside from the station to Zhenru Town. Out of compassion, Tao Yiqian and other citizens there specifically petitioned Mayor Wu, requesting that he build a public cemetery to comfort the loyal souls. Mayor Wu approved the letter and replied that he would find a way to build a public cemetery to preserve it permanently. The correspondence is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e93">Letter from Tao Yiqian and Others <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Respected Mayor Tiecheng: Respectfully, during the January 28th Incident, when the Japanese bandits invaded Shanghai, our national army bravely resisted the enemy in fierce battles that lasted over a month. In the end, the enemy was unsuccessful, and the inland was preserved. Their功was great. The soldiers who fought in the anti-Japanese war were loyal, brave, and righteous, thereby demonstrating the fearless spirit of our Chinese nation. Not only is this a source of infinite glory for history, but it also enhances our international standing. However, the officers and soldiers obeyed righteousness and determined to risk their lives, not caring for themselves, resulting in the loss of life. Those who sacrificed their lives for the country are everywhere within the jurisdiction of Shanghai. At the time, in a hurry, they were hastily buried on the spot. The coffins were very thin and of poor quality. Several or more than ten coffins were buried together in one place, covered with thin soil. A wooden sign over a foot long was erected, only recording their unit, rank, and name. Now, just over a year later, after repeated erosion by wind and rain, the soil has been washed away, and the coffins are gradually exposed. The wooden signs are scattered and incomplete. They are scattered along the Jiaotong Road in Zhenru, Dazhili, and the roadside from the station to Zhenru Town. Thinking of who has no parents, wife, and children, these brave men shed their hot blood and were willing to die for the country, determined to fulfill their志and never return alive. They will never be able to comfort their waiting parents, and they are just a dream in the spring boudoir. Unfortunately, they died on the battlefield, and they were not buried peacefully after death. During the Qingming Festival, weeds entangle the bones, and arched trees gather the souls. Who will offer barley rice? Who will hold a sheet of paper money to commemorate them? If the dead have knowledge, they will also be抚 and cry bitterly, harboring hatred in the underworld. Looking back at the reports, the bones of Japanese soldiers in northern Shanghai are buried with great dignity, and sacrifices are made to them every year. Comparing this with our situation, how can we say that it is fair? Qian is filled with孤 and is just a scholar. He has the heart to serve the country, but he lacks the power to kill the enemy. He has always had the utmost respect for the officers and soldiers who defended the country against the enemy. Today, he witnessed this situation and felt compassion. The state should have proper measures to clean up the aftermath, honor virtue, and reward功. Even if this is not the case, there are many charitable organizations in the source area. If Mr. Ming cares for his袍泽 and does not discriminate, he can initiate the construction of a public cemetery and bury all the officers and soldiers who died in the Shanghai war in one area. Check their names and engrave them on stone one by one, so that they can be preserved for a long time and show the people of the country. By calling out from a high place, it will be easy to arouse sympathy and gain assistance. Otherwise, it is also appropriate to find a way as soon as possible, or to order each police district to work with the urban area office to take care of the original burial sites, where several or more than ten people are buried, and first add soil to form a tall mound and erect a monument. to avoid the tragedy of exposed bones and to comfort the英 souls. They will be grateful and tie grass for you in the dark. Moreover, this move will benefit the appearance of the city and hygiene and is an easy task. I have seen and dared not to take the liberty to express my earnest request, praying for your wisdom and adoption, and prompt implementation.</p>

<p>Since the Ministry of Railways implemented responsible transportation, all sectors have found it convenient, and the business of each railway has increased as a result. The Ministry of Railways is now seeking to promote the convenience of merchants by seeking joint transportation methods with other transportation agencies. For example, the Hunan-Hubei Railway has already implemented joint transportation with various highways in Hunan Province, and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is planning to implement joint transportation with the Beijing-Wu Highway. Other highways and waterways are also being contacted.

<p>Bidding to Commence Within Days, Completion Expected in June</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration ordered the suspension of construction of the Song Park Road site station and postponed the construction of the Pengpu intermodal terminal, the existing destroyed station site is unsightly and lacks office space for the traffic department. Therefore, to remedy the situation, it is planned to rebuild the site, adding a floor in the middle and keeping the surroundings as single-story buildings. In the future, the upper floor will be used as office space for the traffic department, and the lower floor will be used as waiting rooms for first, second, and third-class passengers. The estimated cost is over 40,000 yuan, and the Ministry of Railways was requested to approve it last month. It is now learned that the administration has received a reply from the Ministry of Railways approving it, and public bidding will commence within days to invite construction. It is said that the construction time will be very fast and should be completed within two months. Therefore, in June of this year, the traffic department will move in, and the original site will be converted into a road police training center.</p>

<p>Submitted to the Chamber of Commerce to Request the Central Government to Enforce Them</p>
<p>Various trade associations in the city have submitted a petition to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to be forwarded to the Executive Yuan, requesting that all trades that have not joined the association be ordered to join the association and to prepare methods for joining the association, and to request that they be approved and followed. Upon investigation, the case of trades joining trade associations was resolved at last year's citywide trade representative conference. Your association presented it to the National Government Legislative Yuan, and Article 7 of the Trade Association Law was revised to state that all trades should be members of the trade association and ordered to comply with it. However, after a year, very few trades that have not joined the association have complied with the membership. Most of them still hold a wait-and-see attitude, and some even deliberately undermine the interests of the group. Therefore, it is difficult to improve the association, and laws and regulations are equal to waste. Every time they want to maintain the public interest of the trade, they are hindered, and social undertakings and patriotic movements are not carried out successfully. They do not know that joining the association has the benefit of enjoying the group's interests. Moreover, organizing the people is one of the principles of party governance. If the general trades do not join the association, stick to their misguided views, and abandon the group interests that they should enjoy, the association will become an incomplete organization, which is not a blessing for the business community. Moreover, during the period of political tutelage, there should be no such bad situation. The association and other inquiries and negotiations are the same, and the methods for urging the trades to join the association are proposed, and the method is "Because the people have the obligation to abide by national laws and regulations, the competent department should announce and order them to join the association within a time limit. If they do not comply as scheduled, in addition to being convicted of resisting the national administrative power, they will be forced to join the association" to comply with laws and regulations and to enable the trades to eliminate mutual suspicion, work together with one heart, go to the path of construction, and enjoy the rights that should be enjoyed and the obligations that should be fulfilled. It is true, nothing is more than this, and it is not contrary to reason and emotion. It is reasonable to jointly present it to your association for review and submit it to the Executive Yuan for instructions to follow. In addition, this case was drafted by the Intestine Industry Association, and it is also stated that</p>
<h3 id="e100">City General Labor Union Issues Declaration Against Yarn Factories Reducing Work Hours <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal General Labor Union, in response to the decision by the National Yarn Factories Association to reduce work hours, yesterday specially issued a declaration, stating: "Our nation is unfortunate, suffering under the invasion of the violent Japanese. The people of the whole country are not only angered by the ferocity of the Japanese disaster, but also terrified by the fear of national subjugation. Our workers throughout the country, deeply aware of the gravity of the national crisis, are all striving with the attitude of enduring hardship and bearing heavy burdens to devote their full strength to increasing production, hoping that labor and capital will cooperate to jointly avert the crisis. However, as reported in the newspapers on April 11th, the National Chinese Yarn Factories Association decided that all Chinese-owned yarn factories across the country would uniformly reduce work hours from April 21st, with all work, day and night, suspended on Saturdays and Sundays. Violators of this resolution would be punished according to the rules, etc. Cotton yarn is our country's largest industry. Now, due to the dumping of foreign goods and overproduction, sales have become sluggish. If these factories were to consider the urgency of foreign aggression, they should strive to improve equipment and products to compete with foreign goods. Even as a fallback, they should endure temporary pain to maintain the status quo of this largest industry. Instead, they resort to the passive measure of reducing work hours, not only depriving hundreds of thousands of workers of their livelihood, but also pushing cotton yarn down the same path as silk and tea until it is eliminated. After Chinese factories reduce work hours, the dumping of foreign goods will inevitably become even more severe than before. From then on, Chinese factories will reduce work hours while foreign goods strive to dump their products, which will soon lead to the disappearance of Chinese yarn from the market. Furthermore, business profits and losses are normal occurrences. Moreover, factories such as Shen Xin No. 1 and Minsheng currently have a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Using this as an example, not all yarn factories across the country are necessarily overproducing. It is unreasonable to force all factories across the country to reduce work hours because of the sluggish sales of a portion of them. Moreover, this reduction in work hours is based solely on a resolution from the association, without being submitted to the government for approval, which is a blatant disregard for national laws.

<p>Problems Arise with Free Transportation Passes</p>
<p>The medical team of the Chinese Relief Association was originally scheduled to go north last night. However, they subsequently received a letter from the Shanghai office of the Military Affairs Commission, stating that, regarding the matter of free transportation passes, a telegram had been sent to the Military Affairs Commission, which was then forwarded to the Ministry of Railways for verification and handling. A reply had not yet been received, so it was difficult to process these free transportation passes. Upon hearing this news, the association became extremely anxious and specially appointed Wu Jiang, the director of the wounded soldiers' hospital, to go to the two railway administrations to request accommodation. However, they also stated that they could not act without an order from the ministry, and he returned without success. The departing personnel of the association gathered at the meeting place, looking very worried. Moreover, the preparations had been painstaking and the expenses were not small. Due to the obstruction of passage, they had to postpone their departure to the north.</p>
<h3 id="e103">National Resistance Association Hosts Various Circles <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, Song Qingling and Wu Mai, the director and deputy director of the National Resistance and Self-Salvation Association, hosted various groups at the Victory Hotel on Bubai Road at 7 o'clock the night before last. Those who attended included Xu Xiaotian, Wang Canzhi (daughter of martyr Qiu Jin), and Luo Sizhang and Lu Yong, members of the Blood Soul Assassin Group who had just been released from prison, and more than thirty others. Wu Mai, the chairman, reported on the association's establishment process and purpose, as well as the incident of Japanese patrolmen and ruffians murdering and arresting speakers, and the search and destruction of the Shanghai South Branch of the General Association in the concession. The association is purely a patriotic organization of the people, with no illegal or disorderly conduct. However, imperialists have imposed persecution and destruction, which is an insult to our entire nation. Moreover, without legal procedures, people can be arbitrarily searched and destroyed, which means that the safety of citizens will have no guarantee in the future. It is hoped that all circles will rise up and resist. Next, Wei Sizhang was introduced to report on the arrest and imprisonment process and life in prison, which made those who heard it feel sorrowful. Finally, the staff of the National Resistance and Self-Salvation Association immediately drafted a protest, and all attendees signed it and dispersed.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Defense Committee held its fourteenth member general assembly yesterday. The attendees included various committee members, district regiment leaders, district chiefs, and Xu Yi, director of the general affairs office and concurrently in charge of regimental affairs. The meeting was chaired by Committee Chairman Tang Zhenfei. First, Director Xu of the general affairs office reported on the committee's work situation for the previous month, which focused entirely on inspection and evaluation. This month will focus on completing general training, holding evaluations, and preparing the scores for each subject. A score of 60 or above will be considered passing. They are also preparing to run special training classes and other related matters. Next, the proposals were discussed: (1) Committee Member Zhang proposed holding a drill exercise for the defense regiment; (2) Director Xu of the general affairs office proposed that after the general training ends, the qualified regiment soldiers should be formed into a special service team and assigned commanding officers for dispatching when necessary. The above two items were discussed together and resolved to be handled by the general affairs office in accordance with provincial orders, and to prepare for a drill exercise, taking into account Committee Member Zhang's proposal; (3) The second district regiment leader proposed how to preserve the uniforms of the general training regiment soldiers; (4) Director Xu of the general affairs office proposed that after the general training ends, the unqualified regiment soldiers will not be discharged and the uniforms and symbols that have been issued will be retrieved and preserved as public property. The above two proposals were discussed together and resolved that the unqualified regiment soldiers' symbols and uniforms should be retrieved and preserved by the district regiment headquarters; (5) The second district regiment leader proposed whether to issue commemorative badges to the qualified discharged regiment soldiers. It was resolved that certificates should be issued to the training instructors in each district, and discharge certificates should be issued to the general training regiment soldiers in each district. The remaining award methods will be detailed by the general affairs office and submitted to the next meeting for discussion; (6) The second district regiment leader proposed whether to brand and obtain guarantees for privately owned firearms to prevent accidents.

Should those with good results be selected for use as Jia chiefs and monthly funding for the Jia chiefs be provided to facilitate regimental affairs? It was resolved that the general affairs office should handle this in accordance with the previous case; (8) The second district regiment leader proposed that some regiment soldiers wear uniforms without tickets to ride boats and vehicles, or provide them to others to take advantage of cheap prices. How should this be prohibited? It was resolved that the county government should strictly order the district regiment leaders to supervise the Jia and Pai chiefs in each district to pay attention to the prohibition; (9) The fourth district regiment leader proposed that the next term of the property training class should be handled separately by each district. It was resolved to postpone the discussion; (10) The defense funds must be reorganized according to the approved reduction and redistribution of the annual general budget. It was resolved that the budget for the second half of the twenty-first year should still be submitted to the province for verification and approval, and the difficulties in the transformation should be explained. As for the budget for the twenty-second year, it will be sent after the members are reviewed at the next meeting.</p>

<p>Xu Yonggui, Suspicious and Jealous</p>
<p>Gen Di, the granddaughter of Huang Zigen, the owner of the Jurulin Noodle Restaurant on Nancang Street, Xiaonanmen, was married to Xu Yonggui, the son of Xu Shunrong, the owner of the Xutai Hing Lacquer Shop. Because Gen Di often returned home for long periods, he believed that Xue Aquan, a partner, was enticing her. Therefore, he went to the shop with a knife and injured him the day before yesterday. He was arrested by the police. Now it is learned that Xu Yonggui had a conflict with his father due to the division of the household, so his father drove Yonggui and his wife out. So the young couple lived in the countryside of Chuansha. Gen Di still lives in the countryside, and Xu Yonggui, after obtaining a communication note, became extremely suspicious and took his lacquer craftsman's scraper to Jurulin to question Xue Aquan, which led to the blood case. Xue has now had his wound sealed and is not in danger of death. Xu Yonggui was escorted to the Public Security Bureau by the first district and one office, and then transferred to the district court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Wu Daishi from Shaoxing, 32 years old, came to Shanghai four years ago and worked as a nanny at a certain address on Fangbang Road in the city. Last year, she became acquainted with Liu Fuxing, who was engaged in business, and rented a house at No. 123, Tianbaoli, Haining Road to live together. Later, her husband from Shaoxing, Zhu Jian, found out and came to Shanghai from his original hometown to take his wife Wu back home. In February of this year, his wife escaped from home again and came to Shanghai to live with her lover. Her husband also rushed from his hometown a few days ago and stayed with relatives on Wuding Road. Yesterday morning, Zhu Jian went to Liu Fuxing's house and asked his wife to return to her hometown immediately. The woman refused to the death. Zhu Jian was furious and stabbed his wife three times in the neck with scissors, causing her to fall to the ground injured. Later, the Chinese police heard the news and arrested the murderer and took him to the police station. Wu was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the injury was minor and there was no danger to her life.</p>

<p>At about 11 o'clock last night, four drunk American sailors staggered into the Xiang Sheng Automobile Branch near the Great World on Avenue Edward VII. At that time, there was only one car, No. 81453, parked in the branch. The sailors did not ask for any reason and squeezed into the car, driving it themselves and speeding south on Min Ti Ni Yin Road. However, when they drove to the corner of Ningbo Road, they knocked down two people and the car crashed into the wall, damaging the machinery and making it impossible to move forward. The surrounding pedestrians made a great noise and the detectives gathered, capturing one person on the spot, while the rest fled. The two people who were hit were immediately sent to Renji Hospital. One was Song Yida, 18 years old, from Shandong, who injured his leg, and the other was Ji Xiaoxia, 16 years old, who injured his head. The police are currently investigating.</p>

<p>Chen Maoyin, the daughter of Chen Shenshi, a Ningbo woman currently living at No. 8, Nanlou Deli, Beile Road in the French Concession, was betrothed to Guang Achang, a nephew, by Chen Shenshi's brother, Shen Xincai. They are cousins. However, Achang's father died when he was young, and his mother remarried. Because Achang had no one to take care of him, he lived with his aunt Chen Shenshi from childhood. He studied as a coppersmith when he grew up and has been working on Yangtze River ships since graduating. He married on May 15th two years ago and still lived with his mother-in-law. Because Shen's is a handicraft business, the wages he earns are limited and not enough to support the family, which often leads to disagreements and conflicts between the couple. In the autumn of that year, Chen Maoyin, born on December 2nd of the Republic of China year five, was not yet sixteen years old when she married, and her marriage was arranged by her parents without her consent, which did not meet the marriage conditions stipulated by the Civil Code. Therefore, her mother, Chen Shenshi, acted as her legal agent and hired a lawyer. They first filed with the Second Special Court to request mediation and annul the marriage. Because the mediation failed, they formally filed a lawsuit. The defendant, Shen Achang, presented a counter-argument, stating that he had lived with Maoyin since childhood and that Maoyin was already seventeen years old when they married, opposing the divorce. Subsequently, because the evidence presented was insufficient, the court ruled to dismiss the plaintiff's suit. Chen Shenshi and Chen Maoyin, the mother and daughter, were dissatisfied with the original judgment and filed an appeal with the Higher Third Branch Court. The court was opened for joint trial the other day by Presiding Judge Zhou, Li, and Fan. The appellant presented two midwives who helped with Maoyin's birth to testify that Maoyin was indeed not sixteen years old. The attorney for the respondent, Shen Achang, Wang Shizong, argued that the dispute over age had been clearly explained by the first instance and that the original judgment was very appropriate. If the court had any doubts, please summon the matchmaker, Shen Xincai, to testify. The appellant's request was unfounded, because the respondent was poor and wanted to remarry after the divorce. Please reject the appeal. The court questioned both sides and tried to reconcile them. Because they were unable to reach an agreement, the court postponed the hearing and asked to summon and interrogate the matchmaker.</p>

<p>Sun Qishan, a male, 13 years old, was recommended to the Hu Rongji tailor shop at No. 8, Gao San Branch, Xiai Xian Si Road, French Concession by a relative last year as an apprentice. Alexi Beltoff (transliteration), a Russian, 29 years old, who used to be a dancer, rented the pavilion room of the tailor shop last month. The Russian usually ordered Sun Qishan to buy other things. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Sun was working downstairs when he heard the Russian calling him upstairs, ordering him to buy wine. Sun immediately went upstairs to take the money and went out to buy it. After a while, he brought the wine back upstairs and handed the bottle to the Russian. Unexpectedly, the Russian was suddenly overcome by lust and closed the door, violently wrapping Sun's head and face with a woolen blanket, pressing him on the bed, pulling off his pants, and violently thrusting his genitals into his anus, exerting all his strength to vent his lust. After finishing, he gave three silver coins and told him not to make a sound. The apprentice went downstairs with his injury, and cried out loud because of the unbearable pain. The shop owner asked about the situation and reported it to the Lujiazui police station, which sent detectives to arrest the Russian. After the head detective questioned him, he ordered him to be detained and sent Sun to the hospital for an examination. It was confirmed to be true and he was sent to court for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Shanghai Fishing Industry Crisis in the Midst of Japanese Fishing Aggression <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Treacherous Merchants Seek Profit, Selling Enemy Fish as Domestic Goods, Conspiracy of Enemy Merchants Undermines Future, Worrisome</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Large Batch of Enemy Fish Was Imported but Returned Due to Failure to Sell</p>
<p>According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Shenshi Telegraphic News Agency, China's fishing industry is extremely young. Although it has seen some improvement in recent years, it is difficult to expand due to economic constraints, and it helplessly watches its powerful neighbors invade without being able to resist. Recently, there has been an alarming rumor in the market that enemy fish merchant groups are using various methods to secretly disrupt Shanghai's fish market. In order to understand the situation and the current state of the fish industry in this city, the Central News Agency reporter went to various parties to conduct detailed interviews. The results obtained are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e117">Existing Fishing Vessels <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>China currently has only eleven fishing vessels: Zhonghua, Lianfeng, Yongfeng, Haishun, Yongmao, Mao Feng, Jimei, Haixing, Fuda, Fugui (originally named Dongtai Maru, purchased from Japan for 13,000 yuan), Hesheng Nos. 1 and 2 (originally named Wanyang Maru, purchased from Japan for 20,000 yuan), Minsheng Nos. 1 and 2, etc. Except for Jimei and Haixing, which are leased to the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries Experiment Station, and the Minsheng vessels, which are owned by the Zhejiang Provincial Fisheries School, the rest are owned by fishing companies and fishing industries that catch fish. Among them, Jimei was established the earliest, and Fuda and Fugui were the latest. The total capital is 668,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Current Catching Situation <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The main types of fish currently being caught are yellow croaker (commonly known as small yellow croaker), hairtail, sole, and three types of flatfish. Except for yellow croaker, which is a seasonal item, hairtail and sole are year-round items. Each vessel takes seven to eight days to export, and thirteen to fourteen days at most, before it can import. The amount of fish caught ranges from a hundred boxes or two to three hundred boxes to seven to eight hundred boxes. Civil ships use indigenous methods for catching, so there is no fixed date and it is difficult to calculate. This is because civil ships must first anchor and spread the nets, waiting for the fish to enter on their own, which is not as free and capable as fishing vessels.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Distinction Between Enemy and Us <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Since China was invaded by Japan for no reason, the people have automatically boycotted enemy fish. However, a small number of treacherous merchants are unaware of the consequences and only care about their current small profits. Fish do not have fixed trademarks like cloth or sundries, so it is difficult to distinguish them. Moreover, enemy vessels often steal catches in our territorial waters and sell the fish they catch in our market. In this case, the sources are the same, making it even more difficult to identify. However, the containers for placing the fish can be roughly distinguished. Ningbo goods are loaded in wooden barrels, each barrel can hold about 400 catties. Local fish is loaded in bamboo crates, each crate can hold more than 100 catties. Fish from Dalian are loaded in large wooden boxes or large round wooden barrels, each piece can hold 200 to 300 catties. Enemy goods are in small wooden boxes, each box is only 40 catties. The fish in the boxes are washed with water before being loaded, and the ice on the surface of the boxes is lined with paper to prevent the mud from staining the fish. Therefore, the fish are cleaner than Chinese fish. Insiders can distinguish them at a glance. Flowing net boats (i.e. civilian boats) scatter the fish in the boat, each boat contains less than a hundred dan and no more than seven or eight hundred dan.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Shameless Traitorous Merchants <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The reporter went to the Shanghai Fisheries Enemy Goods Inspection Association to inquire about the recent inspection of enemy goods. According to Committee Member Mao Jusheng, most fish merchants know how to love themselves. Since the violent invasion of our country by Japan, the fish companies have all refused to sell them on behalf. However, a small number of shameless merchants, disregarding the overall situation, seek only a small profit at the moment and change their faces to sell them on behalf. However, the fish industry has a clear understanding of the source of each product, even the very few people are very aware of it. For example, the 800 boxes of enemy fish sold by Shenfeng Xiefeng and Tongxing on the 10th of this month were disguised as bamboo buckets. Later, they were exposed by their peers. Those who were determined to punish them poured kerosene on the enemy fish. The kerosene had not been completely poured and a large part of it was taken away by a plotter, and a small part was still sold in this port. Yesterday, the Japanese fishing vessels Daicheng Maru and Fengyu Maru brought in a large batch of 960 boxes of enemy fish, but they failed to sell and left. There are two reasons for their withdrawal: (1) The public's opposition is extremely strong, and they are still afraid of being treated like Xiefeng Shenfeng, so they poured kerosene; (2) The tax amount is too high and it is not cost-effective. Because the current price of yellow croaker is no more than about six yuan at the lowest, and it is not easy to sell, so it left immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Rumors of Poison <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The reporter further inquired of Mr. Mao, saying that recently there has been quite a rumor in the outside world that imported "enemy goods" small yellow croakers are sometimes treated with poison, and that shortly after eating them, one experiences abdominal pain like being strangled. He asked if this was indeed the case. Mr. Mao replied, saying that he had not heard of this matter. However, he said that even if this rumor is unfounded, our genuine Chinese fish will undoubtedly be affected. Because diners fear being poisoned, they become wary and collectively refrain from eating them.</p>
<p>After the Chaozhou typhoon occurred, fellow merchants really dare not risk great losses.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Recent Sales Prices <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Also according to Mr. Mao, this year's yellow croaker production is quite high, so the selling price is cheap. The best ones sell for only about nine yuan, and the lowest ones are only about six yuan, unlike last year when they could reach more than twenty yuan. Moreover, the sales routes for various goods are as follows: yellow croakers are mostly sold in this city, and salted fish are sold in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and Shanghai on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, and Songjiang, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. Hairtail is sold heavily in Ningbo and Fenghua, and there are also many sales in this city, but not as strong as in Ningbo and Fenghua. Flounder is mostly sold to the "foreign vegetable" (Western food) community, which is what we eat as fried flounder.</p>

<p>According to recent investigations by reporters, in addition to the "enemy merchants" scheming to seize the fishing market in Shanghai, there is also a plot to undermine our coastal fish market. This is supported by recent market conditions. Chinese people have always looked down on commercial competition and often act selfishly and cannot unite, which creates opportunities for "enemy merchants." They have large-scale plans, and once they realize them, our fish market will be almost completely taken over. It is hoped that our fisheries organizations will quickly take action.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Youth Throws Bomb at Umbrella Factory <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Thick smoke filled the air, the smell of sulfur stung the nose, and glass shattered everywhere.</p>
<p>Young man warns unscrupulous merchants, posts warning at factory gate.</p>
<p>Yao Fusheng of Qingjiang, 31 years old, runs the Guangsheng Umbrella Factory at No. 210 Fangbang Road in the French Concession. His business is usually quite prosperous. At about 12 o'clock the night before last, a young man suddenly came and lingered in front of the factory for a long time. Seeing that no one was around, he took out a round object resembling a bomb from his side and threw it forcefully at the factory upstairs. With a loud bang, the object exploded immediately, shaking the house. The young man fled immediately. At that time, the partners in the factory were already asleep. Hearing the loud noise, they were startled from their dreams and put on their clothes to investigate. They saw that the room was filled with thick smoke, the smell of sulfur was stinging their noses, and three panes of glass had been shattered. They were greatly alarmed. The neighbors on the left and right also heard the noise and rushed out to investigate, but the young man was nowhere to be seen. A pane of glass on the upper floor of a building next door to the factory was also shattered by the blast. Then a piece of white paper was found stuck on the factory gate, with a poorly written four-character poem (recorded below). It was then learned that the factory had recently secretly imported a large batch of "enemy goods" in order to make a huge profit, and had been detected by patriotic heroes, who came to throw a bomb as a warning. The matter was reported to the Second Precinct of the First District, and Chief Liu dispatched Sergeant Li Fuyi and others to investigate. A report was prepared and submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for review. The four-character poem is appended below:</p>
<p>A bomb explodes,</p>
<p>Warning to unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<p>"Enemy" goods,</p>
<p>You import and export.</p>
<p>Soldiers on the front lines,</p>
<p>Flesh and blood fly.</p>
<p>Unscrupulous merchants seek profit,</p>
<p>Ignoring national demise.</p>
<p>If you continue to operate,</p>
<p>You will be dealt with accordingly.</p>

<p>Mahjong tiles, alarm clock, school bag, etc. were all stolen, and a coat was left behind in haste.</p>
<p>The shikumen apartment at No. 31, Lane 3, Wenyuan Fang, Rue Pichon, French Concession, is rented by Wang Ruzhou, the owner of Wan Chang Ginseng Shop. The remaining rooms are sublet to a total of four families. At 10:00 AM yesterday, just as Wang was out buying groceries, when there were few people in the house, five robbers suddenly arrived, claiming to be searching for opium. Four of them held pistols, and one in short clothes guarded the back door. The four robbers entered the house and locked the landlady, Mrs. Wang, and a tenant, Luo, in one room. Then they ransacked the rooms upstairs and downstairs, searching at will. In total, Qi Yuying in the second-floor attic lost a pair of gold bracelets, two gold rings, 22 yuan in cash, and five silk qipaos. Li Yongchu's family in the main room upstairs lost 60 yuan in cash, a watch, a gold ring, a set of mahjong tiles, a raincoat, two silk long gowns, and two sets of gauze shirts and trousers. Bao Gu's family in the back room downstairs lost a pair of gold earrings and a gold hairpin. The landlady, Wang Ruzhou, lost an alarm clock, a leather school bag, and a single blanket. Most fortunately, the search lasted two hours, and just then, a tailor knocked on the door. The robbers did not have time to enter the room and search, so she suffered the least loss. In total, the four households lost about 400 to 500 yuan worth of goods. However, the robbers left in a hurry and reportedly left a coat and a leather briefcase in the kitchen. Afterwards, a report was made to the police station in charge requesting an investigation and arrest.</p>

<p>The Nanshi Chinese Merchant Tram Company's new connection between Peace Road and Fangbang Road has been in the works for a long time and has not yet opened. Citizens in the area believe that transportation and commerce are closely related, and everyone hopes that the connection will open soon. It is now learned that the company's transportation department stated that the copper track required for Peace Road from Zhaozhou Road to Nanyang Bridge was ordered from the United States and France, with four crossroads and nine branch lines. They have already been delivered. The method of connection is now being negotiated with the French Company, and construction will begin soon. Therefore, the foundation for the connection at Fangbang Bridge has also been prepared. It is expected that the new line on Peace Road will be connected and open next month. After the opening, Route 4 from Gaochang Temple and Route 2 from Xuejiabang will both go directly from the Old West Gate to Fangbang Bridge to Nanyang Bridge as the terminus. Route 2 will be changed to a circular route, so transportation in the Old West Gate section will be convenient, making it a central location for commercial prosperity.</p>
<p>On the 5th, Wu Yuji Gold Shop was opened, specializing in collecting old gold jewelry from pawnshops, etc. Yesterday at 5:30 PM, Wu returned home from Fourth Horse Road with five taels of old broken gold. Unexpectedly, four robbers were already in the house looting. Seeing that the situation was not good, Wu immediately retreated. Unexpectedly, the robber with the gun grabbed Wu Shijian and threatened him with the gun, not allowing him to make a sound. At that time, more than ten family members had already been driven and locked in one room. The robbers searched Wu's house and stole more than 100 yuan in cash and clothes (the number of pieces is currently unknown), two gold rings, and searched Wu Shijian and stole five taels of old gold jewelry and five yuan in cash. They roared and fled. After the robbers left, Wu regained his composure and immediately reported to Officer Fang of Police Station No. 6. He immediately escorted Wu to the First Branch of the Second District to request an arrest. After Chief Shen inquired in detail about the robbers' appearance and clothing, Wu Shijian said that there were four robbers, all wearing long gowns of different kinds. Three robbers were carrying guns, about thirty or forty years old, with local accents. Chief Shen immediately led Sergeant Ma and others to rush to the area to catch them, but the robbers had already fled far away. Then they went to the victim's home to investigate and vowed to investigate and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>No reply from the Executive Yuan, goods are at risk, if not resolved within three days, preparations will be made to retrieve them.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Pickled Meat Industry and Ham Industry Associations of this city held an emergency meeting of executive committee members in the afternoon to discuss how to deal with the illegal inspection and detention of goods by the Bureau of Health. After mutual consultation, everyone believed that the Bureau of Health's use of coercive measures to detain goods from the South Station and Heshang, valued at a total of 150,000 to 160,000 yuan, would cause the goods to be at risk if delayed for too long. Although the bureau claimed that it had received a "yuan" approval, the industry had already received an order from the Ministry of Industry and the Executive Yuan three months ago to revoke the order. "Shen has not dried", there should be no room for revocation. Recently, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also twice telegraphed the Executive Yuan on its behalf, but why is there no news after half a month? It is clear that there are unspeakable reasons. Businessmen value the detention of goods as their lives. Therefore, everyone unanimously advocated that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce should negotiate with the Bureau of Health to allow all detained goods to be retrieved. If it cannot be resolved within three days, they will decide to retrieve the goods automatically. If the Bureau of Health comes forward to prevent it, they should announce the reasons for denying the Executive Yuan's Second Cut Two Order of Revocation, otherwise any sacrifice will be spared, and it was decided to conduct a large-scale petition to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce today.</p>

<p>(10) Letter from Mr. Liu Simin of this City on Rural Issues</p>
<p>A Second Inquiry to Mr. You Huaigao and Mr. Zhu Tianqing</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. You's remarks on the question of "Can one return to the countryside?", he has published his "penetrating insight into the overall situation and extremely far-sighted vision." Mr. Zhang Mei, Mr. Shi Yu, and I have all expressed dissenting opinions to Mr. You's brilliant views. Although Mr. Zhang and Mr. Shi have slightly different starting points from me in opposing Mr. You, I agree with their opinions. I raised many questions to Mr. You, and I am eagerly awaiting his reply here. Today, after reading the letter from Mr. Zhu Tianqing, a consultant to the Shen Bao readers, I understand that Mr. Zhu sympathizes with Mr. You. Excellent, excellent. First, although we have not yet received Mr. You's reply, a response that sympathizes with Mr. You is naturally the same. Second, Mr. You's brilliant views have found an echo. It is especially interesting to discuss them. This question is definitely not just our personal issue, but a very important issue at present. Because the two sides have different positions, behind these positions lies the most extreme relationship of social conflict. Now, I will discuss this with Mr. Zhu in this letter.</p>
<p>(1) Mr. You is not at all "penetrating in his insight into the overall situation" and has no "far-sighted" "vision" whatsoever. Mr. You's meaning is (and Mr. Zhu also says this) that the most important reason for the suffering of Chinese farmers is their lack of knowledge. Their lack of knowledge is "due to the underdevelopment of rural education." Therefore, he advises people to go to the countryside to run education. Well then, I want to ask, why is rural education in China underdeveloped? Can Mr. You and Mr. Zhu give us an answer? I think your answer (if we infer from your praise of Mr. You's "penetrating insight into the overall situation and extremely far-sighted vision") must be that because no one has "penetrating insight into the overall situation" and no one has a "far-sighted" "vision," no one runs rural education, or those who do run it cannot do it well. Is the question that simple? Isn't this just going in circles in the maze of metaphysics? Or, perhaps Mr. You and Mr. Zhu's answer is a bit more sophisticated than this. They answer that the underdevelopment of rural education in China is due to warlord civil wars, exorbitant taxes, etc., or, as Mr. Zhu said, "The bankruptcy of the countryside is complex, and each has its own background. For example, the bankruptcy of the Chinese countryside is due to internal strife, and the Communist bandits cause chaos everywhere." Ah! Ah. This must be the "far-sighted vision." In that case, I want to ask, where did "internal strife" come from? Did it fall from the sky? Where did the "Communist bandits" come from? Did they grow out of the ground? If a person only sees the surface of social phenomena, then your judgment will never give people a satisfactory answer, and you will never be able to solve the problem. Because you only focus on the surface and the form, how can you have penetrating insight into the overall situation? How can your vision be far-sighted? Moreover, I also want to ask, what exactly is meant by "the bankruptcy of the countryside is complex"? What kind of background is meant by "each has its own background"? For example, in America, if someone who claims to have "penetrating insight into the overall situation and a far-sighted vision" solves a problem by simply saying "the situation is complex and each has its own background," then I can also boast like that. Not only can I boast like that, but any Tom, Dick, or Harry can boast like that. Sir, when we study a social problem, especially a very complex social problem, the first task is to find its main driving force in its confusing, intricate, and colorful phenomena. That is to say, we must distinguish what is the main cause of this phenomenon, what is its material basis, and what is its superstructure. If Mr. You or Mr. Zhu cannot answer my above questions, it is best to keep your mouth shut. (2) Mr. You's advice to people to go to the countryside is entirely a backward individualistic idea. Not only is it backward—Mr. Zhu, don't be angry when I say this. Listen to me. Mr. You said, "People who have lived in the city for a long time may feel bored and lack interest." That is an honest statement. Because the bigwigs, lords, or wealthy people are tired of living in the city, they take their cars, bring their modern young ladies, and go to their villas in the countryside to relax and have fun. This is like the bigwigs eating fancy dishes and drinking brandy. When they are tired of it, they occasionally eat some vegetables and drink some shochu to change their taste. Then they find it particularly interesting. If that is the case, then each can do his own thing, and we have nothing to say. However, Mr. You's "but" (this kind of incoherent writing is inherently flawed, but I am not teaching students to revise essays, so I won't say anything) suddenly says, "I feel that in this time of national crisis, seeing the life of drunken stupor in the city..." When I read this, I was overjoyed, thinking that Mr. You would definitely think of a way for us to save the "national crisis" and change this state of "drunken stupor in the city." But he advises us to "flee" and run to the countryside in a puff of smoke, and even to "find a quiet and lovely village to seek another way out." This fully demonstrates Mr. You's fundamental contradiction. Since he says it is a time of national crisis, we should first deal with the national crisis. For example, if the enemy's knife is against our heads, we can only get rid of this "imminent" disaster before we can talk about other things. How can we have the leisure to "use ten years of effort to build a new-style Utopia that I imagine"? Isn't this self-contradictory? In fact, we have taken Mr. You's words "time of national crisis" too seriously. When Mr. You wrote these words, it was just like the big advertisements in the Shanghai newspapers saying, "In this time of national crisis, buy domestic goods" or "To save the national crisis, the only way is to wear Zhongshan suits made of domestic goods." But the reason why we are nagging is not for Mr. You's sake, but because we are afraid that he will harm people. Mr. You's eyes have not seen the lower classes, and he is fundamentally unwilling to approach the lower classes. Therefore, he advises Mr. Xiong Sheng to "find a quiet village." If you really want to go to the countryside for the sake of the majority of farmers, then you cannot love "quiet" and you cannot like "peace." You must get used to the farmers' tedious nagging, sit and eat with them on an equal footing, and solve their problems. Go to their dirty, unbearable, crying, and starving villages. He cannot stand a little bit of trouble. How many high-minded people who love "quiet" and like "peace" can do this kind of career? If you really want "quiet" and "peace," then you can only build a monastery in a scenic place in the countryside. Go there to make clothes and welcome God. Sometimes you can also see a doctor, preach, and find some "believers" for the farmers. There is no mention of national crisis or not. On the contrary, Zhang Xueliang gave away four provinces of China in half a year, and they are still at war. If you have a little conscience, you should actively instigate anti-Japanese sentiment in the cities first, organize, and then promote it from the cities to the countryside, organize the masses into anti-Japanese national salvation troops and national salvation groups, and teach the farmers that we can only pick up weapons and first drive out the enemy who has invaded our territory before we can talk about other things. You can't wait for you to slowly talk about schools and lecture on poetry and sayings. You can't wait for you to "use ten years of effort to build a new-style Utopia that I imagine." I say that Mr. You's words are doing counter-propaganda for the enemy in our camp, or at least doing counter-propaganda for the enemy unconsciously. (3) Mr. You only sees the trees and not the forest. Mr. You only knows how to advise people to go to the countryside, and to go to "quiet villages" to be "new-style" hermits. (With Mr. You's "new-style Utopia," there will naturally be this kind of "new-style" hermit. Of course, this kind of "new-style" hermit is not the same as the old-fashioned hermits who "step on snow to find plum blossoms" and "drink wine to appreciate chrysanthemums." They "wear Chinese clothes," "can speak foreign languages" (at least understand ABC), wear leather shoes, wear toric glasses, and shout "national crisis is imminent.") This is absolutely unrelated to general rural education. Even if we admit that this method is running rural education, it is like putting a donkey's lips to a horse's mouth. He thinks that "China's great enemy" is not only "Japanese imperialism" but also the farmers' "generations of uneducation." He does not know the reasons for the farmers' generations of uneducation (economic and political). Therefore, there is only this kind of "treating the headache when the head hurts and treating the foot when the foot hurts" method. The political questions I raised in my letter questioning Mr. You, which was published in the Shen Bao on the 12th, are not because I am afraid of political interference or being politically influenced, but because I see that Mr. You is closing his eyes and not looking at politics, closing his mouth and not talking about politics, and closing his mind and not thinking about politics. Today, after seeing Mr. Zhu's great argument, I suddenly understood. The "starting point for building a new-style Utopia" (how to build the starting point, I have the pleasure of seeing it for the first time today) is "to make the people understand national affairs." What does this mean? I am really stupid. I don't understand it at all. "Building a new-style Utopia" and "making the people know national affairs" get married. This is unheard of. Got it. Got it. The starting point for building a "new-style Utopia" is to open up rural education. Therefore, to open up rural education is to make the people understand national affairs as the highest goal. The so-called "to make the people understand national affairs as the highest goal" has confused me again. Breaking it down grammatically, "the people understand national affairs" is the object. "To make" is the verb. If this is the case, then this sentence does not make sense. It should be changed to "to make the people understand national affairs as the highest goal." And "as the highest goal" is a short sentence that describes "to make the people understand national affairs." Otherwise, it should be explained in this way. To make people understand national affairs is the highest goal. That is to say, to teach the people that knowing national affairs is our highest goal. However, this is not coherent with the context and does not make sense either. What is it really? I think, Mr. Zhu, if you said, "Therefore, to open up rural education, the highest goal is to make the people understand national affairs," then it would make sense. I am not deliberately quibbling, but because Mr. You pays attention to the "literate" "leading figures" who go to the countryside. If they are literate but cannot write coherently, wouldn't they lose the demeanor of "leading figures"? Mr. Zhu will say again, "It can be said to be extremely ridiculous." Now, let's assume that this is what it means. Let me ask, how do you know about "national affairs"? You need to study foreign languages. You need telegrams (Mr. You even needs radios). You need to understand the world situation and know history and geography. You need to improve seeds and improve planting and harvesting machinery. These things all come from the city, and under certain conditions (no warlord chaos, no feudal exploitation, no corrupt officials, and political clarity must be above the horizon) can they be obtained. Only then is it possible for the people (the people in Mr. You's eyes are naturally the farmers, naturally the rich farmers) to understand national affairs. Otherwise, a copy of Ma Shi Wentong will ask you to be a flavor. How can it allow you to "make the people understand national affairs"? Moreover, Mr. Zhu's so-called "understanding" is too serious. It is certainly what we hope for that the people can understand national affairs. However, what are these so-called national affairs? I'm afraid it's one "new-style Utopia" on the left and one "new-style Utopia" on the right. Mr. You and Mr. Zhu themselves are far from "understanding" national affairs, let alone "penetrating" them. How can they make the farmers "penetrate" them? I tell you, in the past, the inns or hotels in Beijing city posted four big characters "No talking about national affairs." Then the first and only principle of your "new-style Utopia" for educating farmers is "No talking about national affairs." Not only no talking about national affairs, but also no talking about small national affairs. This is in line with your principles. You can only do this, because you are only deceiving yourselves. Your eyes have never seen the vast majority of people (workers, poor people, and shop assistants) in the city and countryside. You have not seen politics (in fact, you dare not talk about politics). Is the bankruptcy of American and Japanese rural areas more serious than that of China? This depends on the land relationship, the farmers' entire lives, and their cultural level. We will not simply discuss this issue. However, we can say that if Chinese farmers develop to the large-scale agricultural life of American capitalism, their degree of bankruptcy must be similar to that of the United States, or even more serious. (In fact, under the current political situation, Chinese national capital has no ability or courage to directly embark on this path. Because to embark on these two paths, there must be two conditions: to eliminate the oppression and exploitation of imperialism externally and to implement true democratic politics and solve the land problem internally. Otherwise, there is no hope. This is the ABC of current "national affairs.") If American farmers were in the current situation of Chinese farmers, their restlessness would be even more unbearable for even a day. Because their cultural level has increased due to their economic level, they naturally cannot peacefully endure this kind of pain. You close your eyes and do not look at the true picture of the entire society. It is really far from talking about any "national affairs." As for what you said in your fourth point, it is off target. Please see what my original letter said. If your words "It must be known that there is nothing absolute in the world" are the truth, then that is a criticism of Mr. You, which has nothing to do with me.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Fuzhou Students Secretly Head North <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>▲Students of Provincial Normal School Eager to Save the Nation with Blood</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence. The Provincial Normal School in this city has more than 600 male and female students. Recently, they were agitated by the Japanese army's occupation of Rehe, and the crisis in North China. They initiated the organization of a northern rescue team to serve in the war zone. At one time, more than 30 people signed up to join. Some students organized a support association to raise funds for travel expenses. Unexpectedly, the plan was not kept secret and was heard by the school authorities, who informed the families and had the students taken back to avoid accidents. However, the students who were not taken back were still very determined and continued to proceed in secret. On the 10th of this month, the support association prepared 150 yuan for travel expenses and sent Zhao Xiumeng, Chen Lun, Zheng Delan, Wang Tai, Jia Shun, and Yang Yu, all third-year students, to secretly board the Jiji ship to Shanghai on the morning of the 11th, and then head north to Beijing. It was not until after the ship set sail that they sent out a letter of farewell to their teachers and friends. Among them, it was said that this trip to the north was driven by patriotism, and all concepts of family and school were shattered under the surge of hot blood. They are willing to exchange fresh red blood for the nation's freedom. They will not return alive until the violent Japanese stop their bombardment. The words were extremely tragic. There was also a letter from Zhao Xiumeng to his father and brothers, saying that although he knew that the road ahead would be full of hardships, he was very happy in spirit. Compared to sitting in the classroom all day and being bored and restless, he felt that this was better than that. It can also be seen from this that today's young people are wholeheartedly dedicated to one thing. It is now heard that the support association has raised a considerable amount of travel expenses, and the second batch will also depart within a day or two. However, to avoid trouble, their names will be announced later before they set off. Wu Zefan, the principal of the school, believes that the students have secretly left one after another, which has greatly affected the school's future. He has asked the Education Department to send a telegram to the Shanghai Education Bureau to try to intercept them. It is not known whether this will be possible. (April 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e159">Proclamation of the Congress <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The world is on the brink of contradiction and sharp turning points; China has reached a critical moment of survival. As such, Chinese youth, who claim to be the vanguard of the nation, must have a clear understanding and shoulder the great task entrusted to us by this era. In the twentieth century, the world, whether in politics or economics, is like an intricate brocade, with interconnected flaws. Moving one part affects the whole. China cannot exist independently outside this brocade. Since the Great War, the focal point of world political problems has shifted from the Balkan Peninsula. Germany in Europe and China in Asia have become two fuses for explosions on the planet. Currently, the Pacific Ocean is covered in ominous clouds, and hidden reefs lurk in continental Europe. The confrontation between imperialists and small, weak nations, as well as the conflicting interests among imperialist powers, involve intricate machinations. Some seek to redistribute colonies and markets to solve their economic difficulties, others seek to maintain the existing power and consolidate their acquired hegemony, while still others seek to remove external fetters and oppression and establish their own independent territories. In this critical juncture, if these contradictions and disputes are mutually compromised and disputes are quelled, it would be tantamount to giving Japanese imperialists the opportunity to further subjugate China. If they intensify and lead to conflict, it would be the outbreak of a Second World War. In the former scenario, China will be reduced to slavery; in the latter, China will be turned into a battlefield. In this turbulent and dangerous wave, whether the Chinese nation sinks or revives depends entirely on our own efforts and struggles. Fellow students, we should seize the current era, muster courage, and unite our forces to rescue ourselves, our nation, and our country from the vortex of this turbulent era. The May Fourth Movement opened the first glorious chapter in the history of the Chinese student movement and also marked a new era in the Chinese national movement. In the May Fourth Movement, students awakened the broad masses of workers and merchants, forming a nationwide anti-imperialist movement. After the September 18th Incident, the ardent and generous spirit of Shanghai students at that time, and the courage to lie on the tracks and cry out, greatly demonstrated the unique and sound character of Chinese students. However, due to the lack of orderly steps and a complete plan, it ultimately failed to produce significant results. Past experiences and lessons are sufficient for our future reflection and reference. Over the past year, the insatiable greed of the violent Japanese has led them to seize Yu Pass, occupy Rehe through the puppet state of Manchukuo, and now cross the Great Wall to encroach on northern Hebei. However, looking back at the youth in the country, they remain indifferent and apathetic. The degenerate indulge in singing and dancing for their own pleasure, while the ambitious sit quietly, heartbroken and sighing. Without organization, there is no power; without unity, there is no spirit. With international circumstances as they are and the domestic situation as such, if our heroic young students do not rise up to save themselves, save the country, and resist foreign aggression, who else can we rely on? Driven by objective facts, we have established the Shanghai University Students' Federation today. The current era has determined our mission. We believe that the Chinese nation has reached a critical juncture of life and death. With violent enemies invading from the outside and communist bandits disturbing from within, relying on the League of Nations is not a way for the nation to save itself, and merely hoping for the government is not a way to jointly face national crises. No government that is divorced from the people can exert strong authority, nor can any government that is divorced from the people avoid betraying the interests of the people. We should awaken the spirit of the nation, unite the strength of the broad masses, to serve as a backing for the government to resist foreign aggression and save the country, and to complete the mission of the revolution. Standing on this position, we must re-establish the national spirit of a new China, which is one of the goals of this association in the future. Saving the country requires people who can take action, as well as people who can build. It requires the spirit of communication, as well as knowledge and ability. Therefore, in saving the country, we must eliminate chaotic and superficial actions and engage in planned and effective struggles. In self-cultivation, we must sweep away the past decadent habits and create a character of enduring hardship and hard work, which is the second goal of this association in the future. This association is aware of the importance of its responsibilities and deeply recognizes the inadequacy of its strength. It is aware of the long-term nature of its mission and fears that its knowledge and understanding are insufficient. Because of the former, we hope that students from all provinces and cities across the country will unite. Because of the latter, we hope that people from all walks of life will provide sincere guidance. This association is willing to make efforts as a revolutionary vanguard in this time of uncertainty and darkness. This proclamation is hereby made.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Inside and Outside <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— He Jia Gan</p>
<p>The ancients said that there are differences between inside and outside, and the principles are different. A husband is called "Wai Zi" (outside person), and a wife is called "Jian Nei" (humble inside). Wounded soldiers are inside the hospital, while relief goods are outside the hospital; they are not allowed to be received without verification. Outside, one must be at peace; inside, one must be aggressive, or noisy.</p>
<p>○　　　　　○　　　　　○</p>
<p>Mr. He Xiangning sighed: "In the past, I was afraid that they would not rise up; today, I am afraid that they will not die." However, the principles of death are also different inside and outside.</p>
<p>○　　　　　○　　　　　○</p>
<p>Zhuangzi said, "The greatest sorrow is the death of the heart, and the death of the body is secondary." The latter is the lesser of two evils. Therefore, the body on the outside is made to die, while the heart on the inside is made to live. Or, precisely because the heart must live, the body is treated to death. This is called "governing the heart."</p>
<p>○　　　　　○　　　　　○</p>
<p>The principle of governing the heart is very mysterious: the heart certainly must live, but it cannot be *too* alive. If the heart is dead, one will clearly and openly not resist, and as a result, everyone will become uneasy. If the heart is *too* alive, one will have wild thoughts and genuinely want to start resistance; such people "absolutely cannot speak of resisting Japan."</p>
<p>○　　　　　○　　　　　○</p>
<p>In order to calm everyone down, those whose hearts are dead should go abroad; studying abroad is a method of governing the heart. And those whose hearts are too alive are guilty and should be severely punished; this is the method of governing the heart domestically.</p>
<p>○　　　　　○　　　　　○</p>
<p>Mr. He Xiangning believes that "who is a criminal is a very problematic question," which is because she does not understand the principle of differences between inside and outside.</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Death of Bai Yutang (Continued) <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Dai Heng</p>
<p>The strangest death is that of Shen Zhongyuan. This Shen Zhongyuan, nicknamed "Little Zhuge," is also one of the most important characters in the book. When the title of "Pouncing Mouse Five Righteous Ones" was changed to "Seven Knights Five Righteous Ones," the author specifically talked about him in the preface and designated him as one of the knights. Moreover, in chapter 100 of Volume Six, the author solemnly explains him, saying: "The actions of knights and righteous people are different. This is especially true for Shen Zhongyuan. He takes on the reputation of aiding evil, and in front of the treacherous prince, he must echo, flatter, and submit to others. How can one see his chivalry? One does not know that he relies on his superior intelligence and wisdom, seeing matters clearly as if viewing patterns on the palm of his hand. It is like acting in a play, producing chivalry from the game. This is true chivalry. If the Southern Knight, the Northern Knight, the Twin Knights, and even the Little Knight help the poor and relieve the distressed everywhere, who does not know that they are practicing chivalry and righteousness? This is open chivalry, which is easy to do. Shen Zhongyuan cannot be compared to them; he mediates in secret, without revealing any hint, adapting to circumstances and using cunning tactics. When the time comes, he is precisely within the realm of chivalry. Isn't this an extremely difficult thing?" Thus, the author of "Three Knights Five Righteous Ones" praised this knight. However, in the hands of the author of "Sequel to Little Five Righteous Ones," he inevitably died. Perhaps the thoughts of the former author and the latter author diverged. From the former's perspective, Shen Zhongyuan's actions of acting in concert with both sides still did not negate his chivalry and righteousness, and it was an extremely difficult thing. However, from the latter's perspective, Shen Zhongyuan's consistent behavior was unethical and deserved a punishment.</p>
<p>In "Sequel to Little Five Righteous Ones," Shen Zhongyuan is mentioned very little. When the book is nearing its end and the emperor is about to issue a decree to confer official positions, there is no need to be merciless and send this knight, who has endured countless hardships, to his death. However, the author had long harbored a rebellious spirit against the unfairness of the previous author, so he forcefully dragged him in and caused him to die a violent death. How does he describe it? It is a very simple depiction.</p>
<p>"Yao Wen rushed forward and used his staff to strike at the Northern Knight. The Northern Knight used all his strength to block Yao Wen horizontally. Yao Wen could not withstand it, first withdrawing one hand, and that hand could not hold on either, throwing the staff horizontally far away. Unexpectedly, Shen Zhongyuan ran forward, and the staff hit Shen Zhongyuan's temple. Shen Zhongyuan cried out and died. This was because this person was fickle and had an impure heart, so he died first." The author of "Sequel to Little Five Righteous Ones" condemned Shen Zhongyuan to death with the eight-character crime of "fickle and impure heart," and I truly feel wronged for him. In fact, it was because the author of "Sequel to Little Five Righteous Ones" had different moral concepts from the previous author, and he harbored a rebellious spirit, so he fabricated such a crime for him.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Old Literary Models <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>When I was a child, I read the "Guwen Guanzhi" (Anthology of Classical Prose) until I knew every article by heart. The teacher said that we should read it well because the old saying goes, "Read the Tang poems three hundred times, and even if you can't write poetry, you can still recite it." So we "shook our heads and swayed our ears," reading it until it was memorized. Everyone thought that "reading a classical text thoroughly means that even if you can't write essays, you can still copy them." At that time, the teacher said that we children were "promising." Sure enough, after reading the articles thoroughly, the literary realm came naturally. Whenever the teacher gave a topic, we could always write a long piece "pretentiously" and with a "classical flavor." Every article in the "Guwen Guanzhi" almost became a literary model; when we wrote essays, we would fill in the words according to the model. If it wasn't imitating the "Biography of Mr. Five Willows," it was imitating the "Record of the Pavilion of the Old Drunkard." At that time, the teacher also said that we "could discuss the ancients." As a result, our interest in reading articles increased even more. In fact, those who often used the "Guwen Guanzhi" as a literary model were not just us few "greenhorns" who were still wet behind the ears. There were also many literati who specially compiled magazines to write that kind of article. As a result, there were "Urine Sound Rhapsody" imitating "Autumn Sound Rhapsody," "Bathhouse Rhapsody" imitating "A Fang Palace Rhapsody," etc., which were widely circulated for a time, and it was said that "paper became expensive in Luoyang." Even today, I can still find a few magazines and still feel that the authors of these articles, in addition to being "able to discuss the ancients," also have some humor. For example, the "Despotic State Preface" in the fourth issue of ×× magazine, which imitated "Preface to the Peach and Plum Garden":</p>
<p>"A state is the private property of one person; the people are the servants of the ruler. But the hearts of the people are difficult to subdue, and how long can it last? The ancient kings created despotism, which was well-founded. Moreover, the sages taught us clever strategies: giving us fangs and claws and false authority. Giving illusory favors of selling official positions; deceiving foolish subjects to die for them. Burning books and burying scholars, wanting to be the First Emperor of Qin; plundering and levying taxes, feeling ashamed of Jie and Zhou. Suppressing is not enough, and killings are frequently carried out. Implicating three characters to create unjust prisons, satisfying the private feuds of one party. It is better to cause internal strife than to let the state perish. Wanting to cry but unable to, sighing countless times."</p>
<p>Isn't this text suitable for satirizing any era?</p>

<p>It is the third month anniversary of my wife's passing. Early in the morning, the sky is gray and gloomy. My own heart is also generally gray and gloomy.</p>
<p>In a foreign metropolis, I had not heard the call of the rain" from cuckoos for several years. When I first heard it, I felt a sense of intimacy as if meeting an old friend. But today, stubbornly calling like that, I find it very annoying. After lunch, I finally quietly boarded the Shanghai-Minhang long-distance bus in a light rain. For the past three months, every few days, I have been traveling back and forth for two hours on the long-distance bus, sandwiched among small merchants and small landlords. It has become a habit. Initially, every time I set off, I was burdened by sorrow, feeling depressed and suffocated, and feeling nothing else. Recently, it has gradually changed, probably because I have gotten used to it. Every time I set off, there is a bit of joy in my equally sorrowful heart. It is like the feeling I had when I was studying away from home as a child, when I could go home on Saturdays and play for a day or two. For the past three months, haven't I had a home outside Shanghai? Haven't I had a home in that quiet suburb where my only love lives?</p>
<p>Because I have this childlike joy of longing to go home, this originally unfortunate journey filled with grief does not make me feel too uncomfortable. As soon as the bus starts, I can calmly turn around and look at the scenery outside the window. When the bus passes through the Place at the intersection of Xietu Road and Zhaozhou Road, it really looks like a most moving and terrible woodcut from the first part of Dante's Divine Comedy. Fear and hatred arise together. Foreign Places are decorated with statues, fountains, and small patches of grass with pleasing flowers and trees. But here, it is a patch of mud, gathering arched boat awnings that are three or four feet high. Many ragged men and women are crawling in and out of these awnings. What is the difference between them and pigs wallowing in a dirty swamp? When I visited Africa, I saw the homes of the lowest blacks, which were also thatched huts three or four feet high. But the dry tropical soil was at least not something one had to wallow in all day long. It is hard to believe that people are still living such a miserable life in the 20th century. But this frightening snapshot of hell passes quickly, and two minutes later, the bus drives out of the slum and filthy metropolis. What is now unfolding before my eyes is an endless expanse of blooming yellow canola flowers. Two or three low farmhouses are half buried under the canola flowers, and half exposed to the misty spring rain, like a few small boats floating on a lake covered with duckweed. The bus turns several corners in succession, and suddenly I see the Longhua Pagoda and the two bell towers of the Tushan Catholic Church, appearing remotely opposite each other outside the windows on both sides.

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>Through Qiu Ying's introduction, he became acquainted with someone surnamed Zhu. With Jie in the middle, Qiu Ying's attitude was very triumphant, as if showing off her great power in conquering these two men. Later, Qiu Ying said to Haiquan that she was going out with Mr. Zhu and asked Haiquan to look after the house. If Old Cao came back, tell him that she would be back in a little while. Also, if Haiquan wanted to go out, he should lock the door and give the key to the second landlord downstairs.</p>
<p>Hearing that Qiu Ying was going out, Haiquan felt a great disappointment. He had originally planned to invite Old Cao and her for a simple meal when Old Cao returned. Seeing her intimacy with Mr. Zhu, he knew that his plan had failed, and he said listlessly, "I also want to go out and see" a friend.</p>
<p>Haiquan thought that he couldn't possibly stay alone in this ghostly, desolate room and wait for them. He also thought that he wouldn't be so foolish.</p>
<p>"That's really a shame."</p>
<p>Qiu Ying pretended to feel very sorry for him and said to him with a smile. But he just smiled bitterly, as if to show that he had given up his spirit.</p>
<p>At this time, because Qiu Ying wanted to change clothes, Mr. Zhu took the child outside.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, I'll be back in a moment. I hope you come back soon, I'll be waiting for you!"</p>
<p>After she said that, she pursed her changed lips at him. Seeing that there was no one around, he went along with her and had a passionate kiss with her.</p>
<p>He followed them out and parted ways at the tram stop. After watching them happily board the tram, he felt like a person excluded by society, and he felt a wave of sadness and loneliness. He thought that in this situation, he could even shed tears. He stood on the side of the road for a while, and half-consciously walked towards the street where Mrs. Hezi lived. On the way, he saw many Russian men and women without a homeland pursuing low-level pleasures, and he also saw many Annamite police officers who did not forget the hatred of their country strutting past Chinese people, the black conical hats they wore on their heads were also annoying to see. There were also many A-si mixed among these slaves of subjugated nations, chattering and walking past. They were rubbing their fists and palms as they walked. Their power seemed no less than that of the young people who demonstrated this afternoon.</p>
<p>Not far from the alley where Mrs. Hezi lived. Haiquan didn't dare, nor was it convenient to go any further. He only looked at it from a distance and felt that the alley was also very lovely. He regretted kissing Qiu Ying too early.</p>
<p>"Since I can kiss Qiu Ying, then, I can do even more to Mrs. Hezi..." He thought about summoning up his courage to go back and take a look. He firmly believed that with Mrs. Hezi there, there would be no difficulties. However, although he thought so in his heart, his feet were still hesitant and unable to move forward.</p>
<p>He wandered around in that place for a while, and also secretly grieved for himself. Later, he thought that just standing at this intersection would not lead to any results. He decided to leave that place. But he still hesitated for a moment, hoping to see the servant of Mrs. Hezi's house, so he could also inquire about their situation. But he waited for another moment and still didn't see the maid come out. He could only curse himself as a fool in his heart. "A revolution is a must? I can't live such a cold, boring life anymore."</p>

<p>Chapter 4 Business Situation</p>
<p>(B) Business in the New Drug Industry</p>
<p>Prescription merchants used to be a very profitable business, so prescription merchants used to try their best to contact doctors, and even allowed doctors to take a kind of rebate in order to attract business. The initiator was a certain foreign pharmacy, and later all pharmacies followed suit, which became a trend. Moreover, they competed with each other, and the amount of rebates increased to 30% of the drug price, so patients had to spend more than one yuan and three corners to buy a one-yuan medicine. In recent years, this open secret has gradually been exposed by the general public, and new doctors have been criticized for this. Therefore, the Shanghai Medical Association has seriously discussed it several times, and notified its members to advocate resolutely rejecting this kind of bribery. Doctors such as Guo Shi and others have published articles in publications such as "Medical Review". I will not repeat it here. In fact, abolishing this kind of bad practice does not cause any loss of interest to doctors. After all, the rebate income naturally increases or decreases with the number of prescriptions. If a doctor's business is sluggish, the number of prescriptions he writes will naturally not be high. The regular income has been hit, and it is useless to rely on this rebate to cover expenses. However, there are quite a few famous doctors in Shanghai who take advantage of their prosperous careers to randomly prescribe expensive original-bottle new drugs on prescriptions, increase the price of prescriptions, so as to get more rebates, and like to prescribe a new prescription every day, so that patients fill prescriptions every day (one doctor once treated a heart disease, using only digitalis preparations, changing to as many as thirty-one prescriptions. Although he received more than thirty consultation fees and a large amount of surcharges, the patient's family was like opening a small pharmacy, adding two or thirty original-bottle medicines that were only taken two or three times.) This kind of behavior really makes discerning people feel cold, and the academic status is also greatly reduced. On the prescription merchant's side, it is relatively difficult to cancel the rebate, for two reasons: the first point is members in the same industry: the second point is that no one is willing to be the first to create a good example, and risk giving up business. As for the first point, there is actually no need to worry too much, because a 20% rebate has become the norm. Since it is called the norm, it is not enough to be used as a tool for competition. As for the second point, as long as the prescription industry agrees to abolish it at the same time in a certain period, there is nothing wrong with it. However, our Chinese colleagues have never been a thing, and if the agreed-upon period is used, a second small industry will inevitably arise to do this kind of business. Moreover, domestic prescription merchants are afraid that several foreign pharmacies will persuade doctors to steal business. Even this small point shows that if our country wants to rectify something, it is often controlled by foreigners. Therefore, to eliminate this malpractice, three parties must work together: (1) Doctors must maintain their own status and not be greedy for this ill-gotten wealth (it is better to increase consultation fees), (2) Patients in the society must recognize the topic and go to Chinese stores to fill prescriptions to be cheaper, and not hold the psychology of worshiping foreigners and run to foreign pharmacies: (3) New drug prescription merchants should have a broader business vision, and it is better to return to victory. I am publicly publishing this matter here, which is to make patients in the society understand the crux of the matter, so that they can obtain low-priced medicines in the future. As for the real profits of prescription merchants in recent years, they have long been inferior to those of previous years, because the amount of combined preparations dumped in Shanghai by pharmaceutical factories in various countries is increasing day by day. For the sake of convenience, doctors often prescribe ready-made combined preparations on prescriptions. Patients are partial to the three words "imported goods", and they also welcome taking this kind of medicine, and the foreign firms that sell this kind of medicine have their own market prices in Shanghai. Pharmacies filling prescriptions can at most add a little commission and profit, but they cannot increase the price too much. (The secret of the rebate mentioned above is therefore easy to expose.) Moreover, because each pharmacy must hire formal pharmacists and other personnel, the responsibilities are heavy and the expenses are huge, so the profits are thinner than in the era of the apprentice system. The pills, powders, creams, and elixirs made by foreign countries that are popular on the market, from chemical products to the mixing, packaging, bottling, wrapping, and sealing, all require labor, and this labor is naturally calculated in gold standards, plus the cost of transporting water to China, heavy tariffs for import, and then converted into silver, from the drug store to the pharmacy, from the pharmacy to the patient, the price is of course very high. If the medical community uses more raw materials within the possible range, and still prescribes according to the old format, and the pharmacists carefully match them, the efficacy is the same in treating diseases. The medical community and the pharmaceutical community have performed their duties, and the prescription only cares about increasing profits, then the patient's burden is much lighter than buying "imported original medicines".</p>

<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>In recent years, our country has been flooded with Chinese and foreign goods, and the outflow of rights and interests has almost reached its extreme. The result is that the people of the whole country are poor and exhausted, and there are unemployed people everywhere. The strong and fierce are taking risks. Who caused this? Needless to say, the leaders should at least bear half of the responsibility. No one can deny this, right? Our medical and pharmaceutical circles are the latest to wake up. Twenty years ago, it can be said that the application and consumption were entirely in the hands of foreigners. In recent years, new doctors have emerged in the country, and they also know the need for new medicines. As a result, the consumption has gradually increased day by day. The twenty-eight provinces have also become the battleground for medical and pharmaceutical supplies for various countries. Financiers loudly advocate the theory of economic self-determination; medical scientists frantically call for the theory of drug self-sufficiency; the industrial community is competing to imitate; the old medical community is vigorously advocating resistance, and a piece of advocacy for domestic goods often appears shockingly in the newspapers, preaching everywhere, coming from the mouths of adults and gentlemen, and moving the hearts of patriotic people. With such national awareness and efforts, there should be considerable effects and achievements. However, according to the facts, it is far from the truth. In countries with immature science, everything should first follow the advanced, so the supplement of materials, the resistance to foreign goods, first starts with imitation. It can be said very clearly that copying foreign raw materials, foreign styles, foreign effects, and foreign propaganda is not counterfeiting, but recovering rights and interests, and resisting foreign goods. Please think about it, how fierce and cruel is the struggle for rights and interests in the world. At this time, the newly sprouting flower seedlings are extremely easy to be crushed by violent winds and rain. Who is maintaining and planting them? Needless to say, what other power can be relied on besides the government? Therefore, foreign countries have domestic trademark laws. The great goal of trademark registration is to protect domestic products, not to protect foreign products, and to specifically reward domestic products, not to reward foreign products. Therefore, at the beginning of setting up trademark registration, especially in countries flooded with foreign goods, where should the focus of registration be placed? Needless to say, clear-minded politicians will understand. Japan is the most imitative country. Among the industrial and medical products, what does not imitate foreign styles? What does not use foreign names? What does not imitate foreign tones? But the country does not say that it is counterfeiting. Not only does it not say that it is counterfeiting, but if someone says that it is counterfeiting, it will do its best to defend it, explain the differences, and reward its imitation. If you don’t believe it, I can give you a few examples at will. For example, like the Jusnlin we use in medicine, everyone knows that it is a new drug for treating diabetes. Japan imitated it and took the name Juvelin. However, it is not allowed to register or issue capital because its name is similar in sound. Another example is Antophlceglstion, which is Anfu Swelling Relief Plaster, which is popular all over the world. Japan made it and named it llnsbin, but it is not allowed to register or sell because its packaging is the same. Another example is Stannoxyl, which is a tin-made oral medicine for treating carbuncles. Japan imitated it and took the name Etainoxyl, but it is not allowed to register or sell because its sound, packaging, and effect are similar. There are many other examples of this kind of medicine and equipment. The government not only does not prohibit it, but sometimes subsidizes its capital, tells it to manufacture freely, and compensates for its losses. Sometimes it also puts it on display, promotes it, praises its functions, and sometimes hires many medical and pharmaceutical experts to prove it and give it praise. It has not been heard that it is suppressed and prohibited because it wants to pass through the sales field of foreign goods and protect the sales of foreign goods. Why? Because their main focus of commodity competition is international, not domestic, so the goal of national protection and reward is also international, not domestic. To go a step further, international competition is mainly for ourselves, and domestic competition is based on fairness. Therefore, the registration and protection of foreign goods and domestic goods should be separated and not mixed together. The meaning is similar but actually opposite. That is, the reason why domestic trademark registration is necessary is nothing more than to prevent domestic colleagues from imitating or counterfeiting, and to hinder the exclusive right to create. If there are similar products, it is hoped that they will not be the same. As for the imitation and counterfeiting of foreign imported products, the purpose is to resist foreign products and recover rights and interests. Therefore, the imitation strives for likeness, and the more likeness, the more it can achieve the purpose of imitation. If we want to take into account international morality and mutual benefit, we may as well limit it, but if there is a difference in the name, style, color, effect, etc., we must not strictly refer to it as counterfeiting and blow the whistle for prohibition, but instead promote foreign goods. Especially in countries with immature science that are being promoted, this is a point that well-educated citizens and wise ruling authorities should pay close attention to. I ask myself as a doctor, and I am most heartbroken that the medicines, supplies, ointments, injections, and all other medical materials that I give patients every day can be said to be either British, German, French, or American products. Even the products of small countries such as Switzerland and the Netherlands are mixed in. To replace them with domestic products is difficult to replace. Grass roots and tree bark that have not been scientifically refined are of course not suitable for my use. Then, the current imitation and refining is undoubtedly as urgent as firewood. On the one hand, the pharmaceutical industry must work hard, and on the other hand, the government authorities must protect and protect them. Everyone must have some conscience and cooperate fully, so that we can achieve the goal of saving the country and saving ourselves. We must not be muddled, forget our own country, forget our own land, forget our own duty, and forget our own responsibility. In the middle of turning things upside down, we only see more foreign goods in the market, not less. Then, in addition to giving up eating because of choking, we will eventually be poor, weak, dead, and extinct!</p>
<h3 id="e180">On Drinking (II) <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>The third is overflowing drinking. The symptoms of overflowing drinking are: "Drinking water flows, returning to the limbs. When sweat should be produced but is not, the body feels heavy and painful, which is called overflowing drinking." It also says, "Those who suffer from overflowing drinking should be made to sweat." The theory of the source of disease says that the symptoms of overflowing drinking are: "Because of great thirst and excessive drinking of water, the water vapor overflows outside the intestines and stomach, and is between the skin and flesh. Therefore, it is called overflowing drinking. It makes people feel heavy and painful and sweat a lot." There are two differences between the symptoms described and the Essentials of the Golden Cabinet. First, the Essentials of the Golden Cabinet says that water returns to the limbs, while the theory of the source of disease says that water is between the skin and flesh. Second, the Essentials of the Golden Cabinet says no sweating, while the theory of the source of disease says a lot of sweating. And then Guan Qianjin said, "The patient's breath rises upwards. This is all because there is overflowing drinking in the chest. After a long time, the supraclavicular fossa is full and the scrofula swells. There are severe times," and so on. Then I know that the Essentials of the Golden Cabinet only says the limbs, which is its omission and not detailed place. The theory of the source of disease says that it is between the skin and flesh, which is enough to make up for the lack of the Essentials of the Golden Cabinet. Those who overflow with drinking have symptoms of edema in the skin and flesh. Edema of the skin and flesh can occur everywhere in the whole body, not limited to the limbs. Therefore, the sunken place of the supraclavicular fossa is full, and the hidden place of scrofula is</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>is swollen. Please prove it further with the Inner Canon. The Pulse Essentials and Subtle Theory of the Plain Questions says, "Those who are soft and scattered and have a lustrous complexion suffer from overflowing drinking. Those who overflow with drinking are thirsty and drink a lot, and easily enter outside the muscles, skin, intestines, and stomach." Yang Shangshan commented, "With a lustrous complexion." Wang Qixuan commented, "Considering the complexion is floating and lustrous." Both are symptoms of edema. Zhang Jingyue commented, citing the words "People with water disease have a fresh and lustrous face" from the Water Qi Disease chapter of the Essentials of the Golden Cabinet to prove the lustrous complexion of overflowing drinking. From this, the Inner Canon also says that overflowing drinking is water in the muscles and skin, and the color of the muscles and skin is lustrous due to edema. According to this, it can be more undoubtedly that overflowing drinking is edema of the skin and flesh. Moreover, Qianjin Da Wu Yin Wan also said that the water of overflowing drinking is between the upper diaphragm and the five internal organs. That is to say, not only is there edema between the muscles of the whole body, but also the internal organs are considered to have edema. The Essentials of the Golden Cabinet only says the limbs, which will certainly be the symptoms of edema. The limbs are the first to occur, and the limbs are also the most obvious. If so, those who overflow with drinking have circulatory disorders in the heart. Therefore, Qianjin has the symptom of shouldering and breathing upwards, which means rapid breathing. Rapid breathing is also one of the symptoms of heart disease. As for the difference between no sweating and excessive sweating, perhaps one refers to the beginning of the disease and the other refers to after the disease, but I dare not speculate. The fourth is supporting drinking. The symptoms are: "Coughing, leaning on something to breathe, shortness of breath and unable to lie down, its shape is like swelling." It also says, "Supporting drinking also causes panting and inability to lie down, plus shortness of breath. The pulse is normal." It also says, "Supporting drinking between the diaphragm, the person is panting and full, there is a firm blockage under the heart, the complexion is dark. The pulse is deep and tense." It also says, "There is supporting drinking under the heart, the person suffers from dizziness and hallucinations." It also says, "Supporting drinking makes the chest full." It also says, "Supporting drinking makes it impossible to breathe." It also says, "Now I am not thirsty, because there is supporting drinking under the heart." It also says, "The home with supporting drinking coughs annoyingly and has chest pain will not die suddenly, but will die in one hundred days to one year." It also says, "Those whose pulse is weak will surely suffer from dizziness, because the person has supporting drinking in the chest." It also says, "Those who stop being thirsty are suffering from supporting drinking. Those who have supporting drinking should have dizziness. Those who have dizziness will surely vomit." The theory of the source of disease says, "Supporting drinking means that drinking too much water accumulates between the chest and diaphragm, supporting the heart, so it is called supporting drinking. The disease makes people cough and pant, and the body is like swelling." The symptoms of supporting drinking mentioned above are: the pulse is normal, the pulse is deep and tense, coughing, leaning on something to breathe, shortness of breath and unable to lie down, panting and full, there is a firm blockage under the heart, the complexion is dark, dizziness and hallucinations, vomiting, not thirsty, chest pain, and the body is like swelling. It says that the pulse is sometimes normal and sometimes deep and tense, which is not enough to be a guide. The commentators all say that normal means not taut, and they all say that normal means deep and tense, which are far-fetched and cannot be relied on. In short, the pulse is inherently unpredictable. The ancients' words about the pulse are also absurd and unscientific, and are not worth discussing. Saying leaning on something to breathe and unable to lie down is the same as extreme shortness of breath. Saying dark complexion means poor circulation and blood stasis. Dizziness and hallucinations and vomiting are also caused by poor blood circulation in the chest. Those with acute cerebral anemia and congestion of the brain due to blood stasis can all cause dizziness, just like people with arteriosclerosis often suffer from dizziness. Those with severe dizziness will have nausea and vomiting, so there is vomiting. A firm blockage under the heart means that the blood in the liver is stagnant and enlarged. This often causes pain, so there is a symptom of chest pain. Panting, full, and shortness of breath is called cardiac asthma. The body is like swelling, and cardiac asthma can also cause emphysema. The symptoms of emphysema are a protruding back, a distended chest, and a full abdomen, because the lower border of the heart and lungs and the diaphragm all descend. Therefore, it is called "body" because it is not a true symptom of edema, so it is called "like swelling." The achievement of emphysema can come directly from diseases of the respiratory organs, or indirectly from diseases of the heart. This comes from heart disease. Heart disease should cause edema, but it is not mentioned here because heart disease often has symptoms such as coughing, difficulty breathing, and enlarged liver before edema of the skin and flesh occurs, which is not unusual. The reason why I do not consider this a respiratory disease but a heart disease is that the Essentials of the Golden Cabinet mentions lung drinking and supporting drinking together, which means that there is lung drinking outside of supporting drinking, knowing that supporting drinking is not a respiratory disease, which is the first proof. Among the various symptoms of supporting drinking, such as panting, a firm blockage under the heart, shortness of breath, and not being thirsty, are the symptoms of water in the heart in the Essentials of the Golden Cabinet, which is called water in the heart, a firm obstruction under the heart, shortness of breath, and dislike of water and not wanting to drink it. That is, supporting drinking is water in the heart, which is the second proof. A firm blockage under the heart is not a symptom of respiratory diseases. Only heart diseases can be explained by blood stasis in the liver, which is the third proof. Comparing ancient evidence with present evidence, they are all inconsistent with respiratory diseases, but similar to heart diseases, so it is judged to be heart disease. From this point of view, the four drinks of the Essentials of the Golden Cabinet, the disease is either in the stomach and intestines, or in the heart. The drink is either formed from water, such as phlegm drinking and hanging drinking, or formed from fluid filtered out due to blood stasis, such as overflowing drinking, or there is no water at all, such as supporting drinking. The causes are different, and the symptoms are different. Just use the two words "drinking disease" to generalize and unify them. How can it be close to the condition and solve the problem? It is of course not surprising that it is not enough. Alas, this is why the theory of phlegm drinking has been confusing and chaotic for nearly two thousand years, and no one can sort it out.</p>
<h3 id="e181">The Relationship between Aphonia and Pulmonary Tuberculosis <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Hou Guangdi</p>
<p>People suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis often have a hoarse throat, or a sandy voice, or complete aphonia, but there are differences in duration. If you are hoarse for several weeks, take a short rest, and you can still recover. Or it is still good during the day, but slightly hoarse when you wake up in the morning and when you are tired at night. Or if you talk too much or stay by the stove for too long, you will be hoarse for a while. That doesn't matter. The most terrible thing is constant hoarseness, which is very dangerous. It is said that the throat will be damaged. To go a step further, it is the progress of pulmonary tuberculosis. Most of the common throat paralysis (commonly known) is laryngeal tuberculosis. There must be bacteria in his sputum. If you drink and eat with him, the bowls, plates, cups, spoons, chopsticks must not be shared, otherwise you will definitely be infected. Approximately one in ten people with pulmonary tuberculosis will also suffer from throat disease. When the voice becomes hoarse, you must quickly check the throat. Here are three types based on the severity of the symptoms: (A) The throat shows shallow and deep inflammation. The mucous membrane is slightly swollen and bleeding. The color of the vocal cords is mottled. There are sometimes thin ulcers on the surface, and sometimes not. Under this kind of symptom, abnormal voice is expected, but it is not very painful. (B) Both sides of the throat show infiltration. There are many ulcers, and they are deep and long-lasting, causing the throat to rot. There is also a good turn in the disease, and the throat rot stops. Scabs are formed, causing the epiglottis to narrow and causing tracheal obstruction. This kind of throat disease can lose half of its voice or even all of it, and the affected area is unbearably painful. This is because the folds between the epiglottis and the root of the tongue and the epiglottis itself are infiltrated by tuberculosis. (C) This is true laryngeal tuberculosis. Small tubercles occur deep in the throat tissue. The mucous membrane above is pale white and has sparse water. Extremely severe edema is found in the surrounding cells. This kind of throat disease does not initially cause ulcers. The voice may change or not, and there is no certainty. But I feel a sore throat. The progress of this disease is sometimes not very noticeable by the patient. When the tumor rises far away, I am shocked. Once the tumor ruptures, it will be very dangerous.</p>

<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>(5) Precautions for Physicians and Midwives</p>
<p>During childbirth, internal examinations should be kept to a minimum. This is because they can introduce germs, easily cause premature rupture of membranes, or even stimulate the cervix, increasing pain and leading to spasmodic labor pains. Unless there are special circumstances, external examinations are preferable before the membranes rupture. Particular attention should be paid to the characteristics and amount of vaginal discharge, fetal heart sounds, the mother's pulse, breathing, body temperature, the occurrence and duration of contractions, and whether the bladder is full. All of these conditions must be carefully monitored.</p>
<p>(D) Key Points to Note During the Expulsion Stage</p>
<p>(1) Abdominal Pressure</p>
<p>The above-mentioned close monitoring should continue until the membranes rupture. The woman should lie on her back, which is more convenient, or in a semi-recumbent position. A small pillow should be placed under her lower back. During contractions, the woman can be instructed to exert abdominal pressure to help the fetus be expelled quickly. While not specifically indicated at this time, it can naturally increase abdominal pressure.</p>
<p>Use a rope tied to the bed frame or bedpost near the head (commonly called a "delivery rope"). Have the woman hold one end of the rope while also pressing her feet against a fixed object on the bed frame. This will allow her to exert force effectively. If the contractions subside, avoid using abdominal pressure again, as it will be futile.</p>
<p>(2) Expulsion</p>
<p>As the baby's head advances further, the woman will feel an urge to defecate, and the anus will dilate. At this time, physicians, midwives, and others should constantly monitor the fetal heart sounds and the condition of the birth canal. If the fetus's progress is slow, a rapid internal examination should be performed to check whether the baby's head is properly positioned. If abnormal fetal heart sounds or other abnormalities are encountered, prompt rescue measures should be taken. Protecting the perineum is one of the essential duties of physicians and midwives. If the perineum is tense and bulging, and the labia are also extremely tense, the baby's head is about to emerge, and the baby will be born.</p>
<p>(3) Perineal Protection</p>
<p>Why is it important to protect the perineum? Because:</p>
<p>1. The baby's head and shoulders pass through the soft tissue of the birth canal exit too quickly.</p>
<p>2. The baby's head is too large, and the vaginal opening is too small.</p>
<p>3. The perineal tissue is abnormally developed, hard, and lacks elasticity.</p>
<p>4. The pubic arch is narrow, contractions are strong, and the pelvis is abnormal.</p>
<p>These four points are the causes of perineal tears. After a perineal tear occurs, it is very easy for infectious bacteria to enter, often leading to dangerous puerperal fever and other conditions. Therefore, perineal protection techniques must be used to vigorously prevent infection. Old-style midwives also understood that a hardened perineum obstructs the baby's head from emerging. However, they would use their dirty, long fingernails to cruelly cut the perineum and labia. When the woman experiences danger during the puerperium, they would not know the cause. This situation is truly pitiful and lamentable.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Common Sense Q&amp;A on Diseases <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(5) Epidemic Cerebrospinal Meningitis (referred to as Meningitis)</p>
<p>Q: What is Epidemic Cerebrospinal Meningitis?</p>
<p>A: Epidemic Cerebrospinal Meningitis (Meningitis cerebrospinalis epidemica) is a disease caused by inflammation of the meninges or spinal cord membranes due to the invasion of meningococcus. It is simply called meningitis.</p>
<p>Q: Where are these pathogens found?</p>
<p>A: Meningococci are found in the cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and nasopharyngeal secretions of patients.</p>
<p>Q: How do they invade the meninges and spinal cord?</p>
<p>A: They invade the meninges and spinal cord from the nasal mucosa, tonsils, or nearby lymphatic tissue.</p>
<p>Q: In what season does this disease occur?</p>
<p>A: It often becomes epidemic in the spring and autumn, hence the term "epidemic."</p>
<p>Q: Is this disease related to age?</p>
<p>A: Although not strongly related, children are more susceptible to infection.</p>
<p>Q: How long after infection does the disease develop?</p>
<p>A: It requires an incubation period of one to four days.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of the disease when it develops? (To be continued)</p>
<p>A: There is a sudden onset of chills, shivering, and fever. The most prominent symptom is intense occipital headache, accompanied by vomiting. Soon after, neck stiffness, confusion, delirium, and manic excitement appear, eventually leading to drowsiness. In addition, muscle spasms occur in the jaw, back, trunk, and limbs, resulting in trismus (lockjaw), opisthotonos (arching of the back), Kernig's sign, and boat-shaped abdomen. The skin and muscles are very sensitive to touch; even a light touch causes pain. When a hard object is rubbed on the skin, a red mark appears that does not easily disappear. There is also hypersensitivity to light and sound. Skin and tendon reflexes are sometimes diminished. Patients often cry out loudly.</p>
<p>Q: Are there any symptoms related to the brain?</p>
<p>A: Yes. If the oculomotor nerve is affected, nystagmus, strabismus, and ptosis (drooping eyelid) occur. The pupils may be of different sizes, and their reaction to light may be reduced or even absent. Optic neuritis and metastatic ophthalmia may also be seen. In addition, there may be tinnitus, difficulty hearing, hemiplegia, paraplegia, and aphasia.</p>
<p>Q: Is there anything abnormal in the lumbar puncture fluid of people with cerebrospinal meningitis?</p>
<p>A: The lumbar puncture fluid is mostly turbid, with increased pressure, a high protein content, and white blood cells and meningococci. In the late stages, the white blood cells disappear, lymphocytes appear, and the fluid becomes clear again.</p>
<p>Q: What is the body temperature of patients with cerebrospinal meningitis?</p>
<p>A: The patient's body temperature does not always correspond to the severity of the disease. It is usually remittent, but rarely exceeds 40 degrees Celsius. However, just before death, it often rises to a high fever of 41 or 42 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Q: What skin manifestations are there?</p>
<p>A: In the early stages, herpes labialis and facial rashes appear. Measles-like or scarlet fever-like rashes, petechiae, or pinpoint hemorrhages may also be seen.</p>
<p>Q: Are there any symptoms in the digestive system?</p>
<p>A: There may be loss of appetite, constipation or diarrhea, often accompanied by jaundice and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen).</p>
<p>Q: How is the circulatory system affected?</p>
<p>A: There may be dangerous suppurative endocarditis and myocarditis. Pulse rate increases.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Clothes Make the Man, Gold Makes the Buddha <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>"Devaluing the poor and valuing the rich" is something that everyone laments, shaking their heads like a bell after the event, sighing that "folk customs are not what they used to be." But you must know that "clothes make the man, gold makes the Buddha" has "always been the case," though it is "more extreme now." "Wearing fine silk clothes, yet having no rice for dinner at home," one would rather pawn their belt and buckle, and endure hunger for a while, but one must dress smartly and present oneself as a young gentleman. Because if you don't, if you look "shabby and stretched to the limit," with a poor and sour appearance, then opening your mouth to people for "business," even at 108 cents, you can forget it. If you wear fine silk clothes, people will think that "everyone has their urgent needs," and perhaps if you can't borrow 108 cents, you might get ten or eight dollars with "a single word."</p>
<p>It's the same with Buddhas. The statue itself is just clay or wood, but when adorned with gold, it exudes an "awe-inspiring" air. Devout men and women will naturally come to kowtow like pounding garlic, seeking sons before the God of Wealth and asking for fortune at the feet of Guanyin. But if a Buddha in some temple has had its gold stripped off, and its nose is missing, don't expect incense to burn vigorously. Even those who "pick and choose Buddhas to burn incense for," or who love to "burn incense at cold temples," will have a hard time finding it, even with a lantern.</p>
<p>"Clothes make the man, gold makes the Buddha," and by extension, "arming makes the nation." No matter how desperate the diplomatic isolation, no matter how chaotic the infighting among political parties, no matter how bankrupt the industries, no matter how exhausted the finances, only armaments must be expanded day by day. Even if it means squeezing the marrow from the bones of the common people, expansion is still pursued desperately. Because armaments are to a nation what clothes are to a man and gold is to a Buddha. With armaments, everything will be "answered," and one won't be given the cold shoulder.</p>
<p>Which country in the world today isn't frantically struggling to solve its economic problems? To put it bluntly, who isn't worrying about "having no rice for dinner at home?" Everyone is squeezed to the bone, and everyone is clamoring for austerity. Only with armaments do they insist on putting up a grand show and putting on a grand front, even if it kills them. If you have a 10,000-ton cruiser, and I only have 9,999 tons, it's not a matter of business acumen, but of "pawning my cloth" to make it up to 10,000 tons, just to save face.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Vicissitudes of Hair <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Su</p>
<p>When the Qing troops entered the pass, their first achievement was to order the Han people to shave off their hair and wear a braid. Tracing the origin of the insulting "pig tail" hairstyle, one would think that the Qing dynasty bestowed it. At the same time, a barber shop was added to the 360 professions in society. At that time, the prohibition was as strict as the current "crime of harming the Republic," punishable by extreme penalty. It was a matter of forcibly shaving hair along the streets with a sharp blade. Anyone who disobeyed the order would be immediately beheaded. Even now, in remote villages, barbers carrying a pole still have a straight wooden pole on their shoulder pole, which is said to be what they used to hang heads on. According to the elderly, barbers were good at telling unofficial histories and easily gained the favor of customers.</p>
<p>When the Xinhai Revolution arose, the proposal to cut hair led the barbers to believe they would perish together with the Qing dynasty. Who knew that their lifeline would become hundreds of times brighter than before? The barber was transformed into a hairdresser, which perfectly suited the couplet on their door: "Establishing the number one enterprise under heaven, controlling the craft of the top of people's heads." In the past, barbers had to be good at speaking, but now hairdressers must be silent, young, and wear suits and leather shoes, with a pleasant demeanor. Because in the past ten years, not only men needed haircuts, but women had also cut their hair short. I remember once going to a barber shop and seeing a young woman with long hair hanging over her shoulders walking in and saying sweetly, "Is Number Three here? I want a perm." Later, Number Three came out, indeed a handsome young man. Looking at his clever face, his skills must have been superb.</p>
<p>Currently, the hairdressing world has been divided in half by perms. We know that in the bustling cities, a man's haircut has risen from 20 cents to one dollar, making the people in the hinterland speechless. What do they know? Several newly established electric perm parlors in Shanghai are said to start at eight yuan, and the highest price is 35 yuan. Thirty-five yuan would be enough for a small boatman who makes a living by rowing to enjoy for a lifetime. The deformity of mankind clearly has an unspeakable gap, and the extravagance of life has unexpectedly increased.</p>
<p>We know that barber shops that make good use of opportunities have five or six apprentices who, like skirmishers, go to the streets and alleys, aimlessly giving haircuts to the coolies. The heads of the coolies are turned into the apprentices' testing ground, which is another small vicissitude compared to practicing with watermelons in the past.</p>

<p>The truly happy enjoyment is only for those with leisure. The beautiful and delicate flowers that people praise are produced from the muddy soil.</p>
<p>The love of a modern woman is like a turbulent sea. The love of an old-fashioned woman is like a pool of stagnant water that does not flow.</p>
<p>Even the baby born into a wealthy family with abundant wealth will cry when it first comes out of its mother's womb.</p>
<p>The power of light can create everything in the world and destroy everything in the world. If music can relieve people's worries, then why do some people shed tears in the rise and fall of songs?</p>

<p>— Huang Kewei</p>
<p>Nanjing Road at night is as beautiful as a goddess of peace and as ugly as a hideous devil. The red and definitely not green neon lights, the square, long, and big discount banners, the electric trams writhing like long snakes, spitting out one batch and swallowing another. A 1933-style car stopped in front of a large company. With a "cha cha" sound, two Russian bodyguards jumped out of the car first, their slippery eyes looking around, their hands groping for the short, sturdy pistol in their pockets. Then, a gentleman in a British camel-hair coat, with a thoroughly modernized woman tucked under his arm, shaking his walking stick, his leather shoes crisply stepping on the terrazzo.</p>
<p>Pigeon-shaped old rifles, reaching out, annoying.</p>
<p>Plaster statue wilds, selling meat, foul air fills the sky.</p>
<p>Short, thin three, snatching rice buckets, truly brave.</p>
<p>Crying refugees, complaining to the ground, how pitiful.</p>
<p>Each different way of doing things is all for the sake of eating, rice... rice.</p>
<p>Flowing cards, flowing people, seductive eyes, red lips, thighs, breasts, buttocks, souls all out, countrymen fooled, thugs with crooked hats extorting money, white foreign coins flying away, hard fists landing on bodies.</p>
<p>Young girls strolling on the road, greasy rogues making jokes, the price of a cheap lure, the beautiful mermaid caught alive, the restaurant welcoming people with a smile, chastity lost in a moment.</p>
<p>Shanghai is full of sin everywhere and shows contradictions everywhere. How many people are struggling and trembling on this heavenly Nanjing Road, living a hellish life!</p>
<h3 id="e188">Ancient Words, Modern Proof <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Shui Lian</p>
<p>Married couples: The divorce cases published in the social news section of newspapers are truly numerous. Investigating the reasons, it is all because men and women do not have braids. Su Wu's poem: "We tie our hair to become husband and wife, our love knows no doubt." In ancient times, both men and women kept long hair, and even in death, they were tightly bound together as ghosts in the same tomb. Divorce was absolutely rare. Later, the men's hair was shaved off, but fortunately, the women kept theirs, and could use their long hair to wrap around the necks of the men. But now that neither men nor women have long hair, there is no hair to tie, so they advocate divorce at the slightest provocation.</p>
<p>Seamless Heavenly Clothes: The lining of the cheongsam worn by modern women is mostly not sewn to the outer fabric. The colors are very bright: if it is not bright red silk, then it is Yang Guifei-colored silk. When a breeze gently touches it, the outer fabric and lining will fly together like a feather and ascend to immortality. Its style can be said to be particularly unique. The Strange Tales state that the Weaver Girl replied to Guo Han's question, saying, "Heavenly clothes are not made by needle and thread." Then the cheongsam of modern young ladies is the "heavenly clothes" that the Weaver Girl spoke of.</p>
<p>Walking on Thin Ice: When girls wearing high heels walk on cobblestone streets, even though they try their best to maintain a natural posture, they inevitably tremble, stagger, and look like they are about to fall. The poem says, "Like walking on thin ice." It is probably a hymn for the young ladies.</p>
<p>Hair Stands on End: The meaning of these two words is that the hair stands up straight, which is used to describe the state of a person when angry. In reality, soft hair cannot stand straight. But in today's 20th century, even without anger, there is a real possibility. Isn't the beautiful hair of the girls permed to be fluffy and loose, like gold threads standing straight up?</p>
<p>Women's Rare News</p>
<h3 id="e189">Women's Solidarity <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Juan Yun</p>
<p>"Walking alone, sitting alone, singing alone, drinking alone, and sleeping alone." Since ancient times, a woman has guarded a boudoir, spending a lonely and desolate life. Therefore, when talking about women's poetry, it mostly tells of "broken-hearted fragrances and a lonely life!" For most women, the view of life is "just one word of sorrow?" There was no significant connection between women, let alone any talk of women's solidarity. At most, there would be two or three close friends who might go to the suburbs for a walk or sing in the grass. Or, in childhood, there might be childhood sweethearts, innocent lovers, but after reaching the age of marriage, they could only be close and distant. After marriage, it was only "guarding the window and wondering how to pass the long dark nights?" To be able to "wear skewed hairpins and laugh with her husband" was already the supreme happiness in the boudoir? Therefore, in general, there was absolutely no solidarity in a woman's life. Even if some women reached middle age, had patriotic intentions, or had companions to put together a game, or believed in gods and liked Buddha, there were incense burners and worshipers who did homework, but no matter what, it was not enough to be called solidarity.</p>
<p>Although women's rights are increasing now, and some women are shouting and running around, striving for social welfare, and there are many classmates in girls' schools, and there are also colleagues in the professional world when they step into the social market, women's solidarity is still very difficult.</p>
<p>Take the schools as an example. Although there are teachers and friends in the same hall, and the seats are full of good friends, there are still very few soulmates. Once they get married, some go to different corners of the world and never see each other again. Everyone has their own family affairs, so that those who are isolated become isolated, and those who are familiar gradually disperse. Even today, most of the women in families and society are still like a tray of loose sand. They have never thought that women should contact and unite, and that women can do many great things with solidarity.</p>
<p>Indeed, a few enlightened women have organized women's associations, YWCAs, etc. After all, the number of people is too small, and the strength is naturally weak. Only a few wives of politicians, and a few women who already have status and occupations participate, or there are even those who join the association but never attend meetings, which is not surprising.</p>
<p>However, to promote the women's movement, it is necessary to actually unite the majority of women. If there is only empty talk and a few high-sounding words about women's rights, it seems that it will not help. Even worse, if you let a man work hard to promote them, it is simply hitting a boot with a scratching stick. It's extremely ridiculous. What about the future development of women's rights? It depends on how women unite.</p>
<h3 id="e190">The "Vitality" of Women's Issues <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Cha</p>
<p>"Marry a chicken, follow the chicken; marry a dog, follow the dog." These two proverbs clearly say that women are appendages of men. Originally, the only virtue that feudal society believed in for women was "three obediences and four virtues." The so-called three obediences were to obey the father, the son, and "marry a chicken, follow the chicken; marry a dog, follow the dog," which can be said to be an explanation of "obeying the husband."</p>
<p>Although the times have changed, what with the women's liberation movement and the issue of women's careers, in a society that has always been centered on men, in the end it only forms a deformed phenomenon, and the result is getting worse and worse. The so-called liberation has added a group of modern women who only know how to enjoy and consume and do not work or produce; the so-called careers have added a group of "vases" that are for people to enjoy and contain a decorative nature.</p>
<p>Women's issues are indeed an important issue, because women and men must equally take half the responsibility for everything in society.</p>
<p>Movies are the only tool for social education, and should pay close attention to women's issues. However, past works on women's issues have been nothing more than marriage and love, with no significant meaning. Recently, Tianyi Company made a sound film "Vitality," which has profound enlightenment on women's issues. Its central ideas include the following points: eradicating women's dependency habits; developing women's self-reliance; promoting women's legitimate careers; and pointing out the path for women to strive for the country.</p>

<p>Chapter Four: The Situation Reopens, Tea is Served, and Long-Accumulated Affection is倾斜d. The Year-End is Difficult to Pass and the Pawnshop Makes a Mournful Sound.</p>
<p>Looking at him, it was clear that the five dollars were borrowed from someone else. It was useless for me to rely on him there. I gave up. The debts I owed outside were only ten dollars. I collected the money I earned, paid off the most important debts, and gave a little less to one or two of the remaining ones. I could owe a little, and that would probably get me through. As long as I paid off the debts, it didn't matter if I celebrated the New Year. When Guizhi heard that her mother had really not gotten the money, she knew it was no joke. She had to start collecting wages on the streets immediately. The poor were most afraid of the end of the year, which was approaching. It was already New Year's Eve. The coal shop came to ask for money the day before, a total of five dollars, a large sum. The person delivering kerosene and sesame oil also came to settle the bill, a total of more than two dollars. There were also four or five other items, each of which was over one dollar. Jiang Shi did not dare to pay in advance, but pushed it off until tomorrow. By New Year's Eve, someone was calling out "Old Lady Yang" outside the window early in the morning. These two days, Jiang Shi's ears were on alert. As soon as someone called her, her heart would jump. At this time, she heard someone calling outside and looked out the window. It was the person delivering oil standing in the courtyard. Jiang Shi said: "Shopkeeper, come in and sit for a while." The oil seller said: "I'm busy, I won't sit. Please lend me the money first." Jiang Shi then took out a dollar and sent it out, saying with a smile: "I'm really sorry, I haven't collected any money this year, you..." The oil seller saw that she only had a dollar in her hand, and said with a stern face: "That won't work! Usually when I ask you for money, you always say you settle the bill at the three festivals. It's New Year's Eve, and you want to delay again. That won't work." Jiang Shi then took out a dollar and sent it out, saying with a smile: "I really haven't received any money, in the first month..." The oil seller said: "No way! If you don't have any money at the end of the year, where will you get the money in the first month? It's a total of more than two dollars, so you're planning to owe more than a dollar, that won't work." He said the words louder and louder, and repeated "that won't work" several times. Jiang Shi looked at his aggressive attitude, holding a dollar in her hand, standing under the eaves in a daze, unable to say anything. The oil seller raised his head, folded his two large sleeves, stood in the middle of the courtyard, and kept shaking one foot. Guizhi rushed out of the house and said: "Isn't it just a matter of two dollars? Anyway, it won't force people to hang themselves, just give it to him." (44)</p>

<h3 id="e192">Railway Transportation and Rural Economy (Part 1) <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The difficulties of the national rural economy are now intense. The cry of rural bankruptcy is heard almost daily. Some argue that low grain prices injure farmers, which is the primary cause of rural economic bankruptcy in recent times. However, low grain prices are merely a symptom, not the underlying pathology; they are the result, not the cause. If we want to investigate the true reasons for the suffering of our country's rural areas, the situation is extremely complex and cannot be summarized by the two words "low grain prices." The main points are: (1) agricultural finance is depleted, agricultural products cannot be stored, and as soon as they are harvested, they must be sold off, with few able to wait for a good price; (2) in recent years, commercial finance has also shown signs of depletion in various parts of the interior, the market's turnover is slow, and there is no surplus capital to purchase agricultural products for hoarding; (3) transportation is inconvenient in various places, agricultural products cannot be transported long distances, sales channels are narrow, and market prices are naturally low; (4) foreign agricultural products, through their mass production and dumping policies, deeply penetrate various parts of our country to compete with our country's products, resulting in a major blow; (5) there are no protection measures against competition from foreign agricultural products, and there are no incentive measures for the export of domestic agricultural products, so overseas markets are not ours; (6) farmers have limited knowledge and follow old ways in selling their products, not knowing how to develop new markets or improve sales methods, leaving themselves at the mercy of middlemen's exploitation and deception; (7) areas accessible by water and land transportation often suffer from poor facilities, lack of coordination, and high freight rates, making it impossible to use transportation to promote the sales of agricultural products; (8) rice embargoes in various provinces are often tightened or relaxed at different times, and the effort to redistribute surpluses and deficits is insufficient. In summary, these eight points are the main causes of low grain prices harming farmers and the consequences of rural economic bankruptcy. Among them, the impact of transportation problems is particularly profound. To avoid the adverse consequences of low grain prices, we must rely on financial regulation and, even more so, on the improvement of transportation. Without a universal, convenient, fast, low-cost, and interconnected transportation system, the sales of agricultural products will never be developed. Famine is enough to harm the people, but a bumper year will also lead to freezing and starvation. This article aims to discuss how to encourage the promotion of agricultural product sales and protect the interests of domestic agricultural products through various transportation methods. Although this cannot solve the entire rural economic problem, it is an essential path in the solution process. Therefore, it is divided into the following sections for separate discussion:</p>
<h3 id="e193">(A) Encouraging the Export of Agricultural Products <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, domestic food shortages have led to the import of large amounts of foreign wheat, foreign rice, and other items. Under these pathological conditions, it seems insufficient to talk about the export of agricultural products. However, there are many types of agricultural products. Our country has some agricultural products that are insufficient and others that are surplus. Looking at our country's export statistics, raw materials still account for the majority, which shows that the export of agricultural products is indeed a significant item in international lending. Encouraging it will not only benefit the lives of farmers but also supplement the national economy. More exports mean more sales channels, which is of great benefit to the future of rural areas. From the perspective of railways, the export of agricultural products increases transportation, and business will also increase. This is the most convenient way to benefit oneself and others. Now, if we want to encourage the export of agricultural products from the railway transportation aspect, there are several methods, which are described below: (1) Promulgate special prices and dedicated prices for agricultural product exports. Agricultural products that are to be exported are mostly transported from the interior to the major trading ports before they can be exported. Therefore, freight is a major burden for exported agricultural products. If we want to encourage their export, we must issue a special price or dedicated price to reduce their burden separately. This special price or dedicated price should only apply to agricultural products that are truly exported; those transported to various parts of the country for sale should not use it. When setting special prices or dedicated prices, you can do it not based on mileage as the absolute basis but adopt a zoning freight rate system (Group Rates). The so-called zoning freight rate is to divide the producing areas into several large regions. All the same goods transported from the same region to a certain export port will be charged the same freight. The distance, whether far or near, within the same region, is not distinguished. In this way, agricultural products far in the interior can also have the convenience of being transported out and will not be discouraged by the distance. This is the advantage of zoning freight rates. American railways use this system, and its purpose is also to seek the distribution and balanced development of industries. Therefore, the special price or dedicated price for agricultural product exports is lower than the ordinary freight rate on the one hand, and the zoning system is wider than the mileage system of ordinary freight rates on the other hand. With these two points, it will be able to exert its powerful role in encouraging the export of agricultural products. On the one hand, it reduces freight, and on the other hand, it eliminates barriers. Agricultural products across the country almost have an equal opportunity to export, and there is no doubt that the quantity will increase. As for the method of zoning, it must vary depending on the products of different places. All places with comparable products can be included in the same region for balance and to avoid unevenness. In the future, when agricultural product sales cooperative organizations are established in various places, they can sign dedicated agricultural product export prices with them to engage in dedicated transportation, which will be a further step in encouragement compared to special prices.</p>
<p>(2) Implement the agricultural product stop-in-transit business. Agricultural products are transported from the interior to commercial ports, and before they are exported, they often have to go through considerable procedures before they can be declared for export. For example, cotton must be compressed or re-bundled, rice and wheat must be dehusked or debranned, tobacco leaves must be cut, wool must be sorted, and tea leaves must be reprocessed. These are all necessary procedures, without which it is impossible to meet the needs of the market and reduce the cost of transportation. Moreover, export goods often have to stay in the place of export for a considerable period of time in order to negotiate sales or wait for ships to be shipped. Therefore, there are many cases where goods can be directly unloaded from the train and loaded onto ships, and there are also many cases where they need to stop in transit. Railways should provide all kinds of conveniences for this kind of export agricultural products that stop in transit. The most important thing is to build large warehouses at the end of the railway line so that they can be stored nearby without having to be sent to other places, which would only increase costs. If we can go a step further and attract merchants to build various packing, pressing, manufacturing, and other factories near the end of the railway line so that export agricultural products that need to go through these procedures can be processed in nearby factories without having to be sent far away, it will be even more economical and convenient. The construction of these factories can be considered in terms of urgency and carried out gradually. Initially, it should be limited to the factories needed for major commodities, and then gradually expanded to achieve popularization.</p>
<p>(3) Implement combined sea-land transportation. Western railways all have methods of combined transportation with shipping companies, and some even run their own shipping businesses to seek further interconnection, such as the Canadian Pacific Railway. Our country's railways have not paid attention to combined sea-land transportation in the past, which has hindered the development of trade. If we want to encourage the export of agricultural products now, we must implement combined sea-land transportation, otherwise, repeated handling will be costly and troublesome. The method of combined sea-land transportation first involves building large-scale railway terminals so that ocean-going ships can dock for loading and unloading. It also requires large warehouses to store import and export goods. If this is not the case, goods transported by railway cannot be directly loaded onto ships for export, and there will be many twists and turns and waste. In addition, the installation of various types of cranes should be carried out in order to facilitate the lifting and unloading of various types of goods. This is the material construction that combined sea-land transportation should have. Secondly, railways and shipping companies must sign combined transportation contracts, clearly defining the rights, obligations, and responsibilities of both parties, and adopt sea-land combined transportation bills of lading (Through Export Bill of Lading) to save procedures. Those who transport goods from the interior for export can obtain the sea-land combined transportation bill of lading at the departure station, and the payment of freight and various fees will be completed. All the procedures for loading the train and loading the ship will be handled by the railway or shipping company on behalf of the shipper, without the need for the shipper to take care of it. How convenient is this for export? As for goods that stop in transit, the sea-land combined transportation bill of lading cannot be applied, but the procedures for unloading the train and loading the ship can still be entrusted to the carrier for agency.</p>
<h3 id="e194">(B) Protecting Domestic Agricultural Products <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, foreign food and other agricultural products have been imported in a steady stream, so that China, which is known as an agricultural country, also has to rely on imported agricultural products, which costs a lot of money every year, which is heartbreaking. Although the import of foreign agricultural products was initially due to the insufficiency of our country's agricultural products, which was necessary to balance surpluses and deficits. But today, many overseas agricultural products are imported for the purpose of expanding the market due to overproduction. As a result, our country's inherent agricultural products are suppressed by foreign goods, and market prices plummet. Even in years of good harvest, farmers have no profit to make. The adjustment of surpluses and deficits has turned into market competition, and its harm is not only the amount of imports. For the current plan, it is not enough to protect our country's agricultural products to resist foreign oppression, because agricultural products need protection, and there is no difference from industrial products. In terms of government, the protection method is to use protective tariffs, and in terms of railway transportation, there are also methods that can be used for protection, and its effect may not be less than tariffs. The discussion is as follows: (1) Improve the grading of agricultural products. The method of grading in our country's railways has always had differential treatment for foreign goods; for example, imported cotton yarn or foreign-made cloth are listed as second class, "others are listed as fourth class, imported leather cloth or foreign-made ones are listed as third class, and others (unless otherwise specified) are listed as fourth class, all of which are intended to show protection and supplement the inadequacy of our country's tariffs. However, there are no provisions for this kind of differential treatment in agricultural products. For example, rice, wheat, fresh fruits, cotton, tobacco, tea, oil, and other items are all imported from foreign countries, but there is no distinction between foreign goods and domestic goods in the grading table. This is not because the grading is incomplete, but because the issue of protecting agricultural products has not been given deep attention in our country. However, agricultural products that compete with foreign goods should receive the same protection as industrial products, which is especially true in agricultural countries, and experts have already discussed this, so there is no need to repeat it. In the future, the grading of railway goods should also give differential grades and treatment to domestic agricultural products that compete with imported goods, so that domestic agricultural products can have more protection and will not be overwhelmed by foreign goods and plummet in price. Is this one way to save the situation of low grain prices harming farmers?</p>
<p>(2) Promulgate special prices to protect domestic agricultural products. Protecting domestic agricultural products from the differential of freight grading and reducing freight rates is the same path to different goals, and there is no difference. However, charging according to ordinary grading freight rates is sometimes too expensive, which loses the original purpose of protection. As a result, the market is still captured by foreign goods, and domestic products are squeezed out. For example, domestic cotton is sometimes more expensive to transport than foreign cotton. The same is true for rice, wheat, and vegetables. Although foreign labor is more expensive than our country, its production is organized, large-scale, mechanical, and scientific, so its production costs are not necessarily more expensive than our country. In addition, the prevalence of dumping policies and the discharge of surplus production are enough to suppress domestic products. Therefore, for domestic agricultural products that compete fiercely with foreign goods, in addition to differential grading, it is also appropriate to give them particularly low special prices to provide thorough protection. This kind of special price can also adopt the principle of zoning instead of basing it on mileage, so that agricultural products from all over the country can compete with foreign goods in the market and rise up to replace them. In modern commercial warfare, it is necessary to gather the strength of the whole country to cope with it. If products from distant places are hindered by the long distance, the competitive power will be greatly reduced, and protection will only be a small benefit for the local area. This is why zoning special prices are important.</p>
<p>(3) Promulgate special prices to control imported agricultural products. For domestic agricultural products that compete fiercely with foreign goods, low special prices should be stipulated to protect them, as mentioned above. Conversely, for foreign agricultural products that compete fiercely with domestic products, a high special price should also be stipulated to control them and resist them, so that both can work together and achieve results more easily. When stipulating this kind of special price, we must first investigate the production cost of this kind of foreign agricultural product and compare it with the cost of the same product in our country. If the former is greater than the latter, the import special price may be slightly lower. If the former is less than the latter, the import special price should be specially increased to make domestic agricultural products have a more advantageous position to increase their competitiveness. For example, the production cost (including freight) of a certain foreign grain is five yuan per stone, and the cost of the same product in our country is four yuan and five jiao. Although the former is greater than the latter, domestic products may not be able to be enemies of foreign goods. The production scale of foreign goods is larger, and they mainly aim to make a small profit and sell more. If the goods can be sold for six yuan per stone, they can make a profit because of the large quantity, while our farmers' production capacity is weak, and the income is still small. Compared with the time when foreign goods have not invaded, the income has been greatly reduced, and the impact can be imagined. Moreover, the cost of foreign goods is not necessarily higher than that of domestic products. In recent years, domestic material resources have been difficult, and production methods have remained the same. In addition, the heavy taxes and many losses have caused the cost of agricultural products to exceed the market price. It is no accident that farmers are poorly clothed and fed. Therefore, for the current plan, if we do not control foreign agricultural products, we cannot seek the revival of domestic products. When the government is unable to levy protective tariffs, it should seek a corresponding way out from the aspect of freight rates. This is the so-called special price for imported agricultural products. In places where railways do not compete with waterways, this special price can be promoted without hindrance. Where there is competition, we should seek cooperation with waterways and proceed together, and not disregard the national economy due to the difference in interests. Then things may not be impossible.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Will the Great Powers Really Impose an Economic Blockade on Japan? By Xu Nan <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>On February 24th, the League of Nations, by an overwhelming majority of all but one vote, passed the General Assembly report on the Northeast Incident. All Chinese were overjoyed, believing that this was a great victory for China in diplomacy and a manifestation of justice being in the hearts of the people. Indeed, the League of Nations has fulfilled its face-saving responsibility to us. As for whether the resolution can take effect, it depends on whether there is a deterrent power after the resolution. If not, isn't it just a piece of paper? The Chinese people are very clear about this, so they still take the attitude of expecting the League of Nations in the past and hope that the member states of the League of Nations will impose sanctions on Japan. Now, let's discuss the possibility of powerful countries imposing sanctions on Japan. First, let's look at the methods available to the League of Nations for sanctioning a violating country.</p>
<p>According to Article 16 of the Covenant, the League of Nations has three methods to sanction violating countries: (1) economic blockade, (2) military sanctions, and (3) expulsion. Japan had already formally announced its withdrawal on March 27th, without waiting to be expelled, so the third method of sanctioning is of course ineffective. As for military sanctions, modern countries no longer have the enthusiasm of medieval crusaders to sacrifice for the sake of truth and faith. Therefore, the only remaining hope is economic blockade. "Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13 or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League. The latter hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not." (Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Covenant) In today's world where economic relations are already very close, this kind of sanction is very severe. However, for an economic blockade to be fully effective, it must have two major conditions: (1) a complete naval blockade and (2) a united front of the great powers. Japan's terrain is narrow and long, surrounded by the sea, and an absolute blockade is very difficult. The Japanese Navy Ministry also issued a statement on March 22nd: "The people will never yield to any blockade... In the event of a blockade, the Navy Ministry is prepared to respond with force..." Therefore, the first condition of economic blockade cannot be established. What about the second condition? Even if the member states of the League of Nations implement a blockade, it is difficult for the blockade to be effective if non-member states do not act together. This was clearly shown in the Allies' blockade of Germany before the United States entered the last war. Therefore, we must consider the attitude of the United States. Looking at the trade relations between Japan and the United States, they have always been very close. In 1932, Japan's total exports were 1.41 billion yen, of which 445 million yen were exported to the United States, accounting for 3/10.2 of the total exports. In the same year, the total imports were 1.431 billion yen, of which only 3/10.6 were imported from the United States. The United States is clearly in a favorable position. In terms of trade goods, raw silk is the main export from Japan to the United States. In 1932, Japan exported 547,000 catties of raw silk, worth 382 million yen. The United States accounted for 512,000 catties, worth 360 million yen; the United Kingdom accounted for 13,000 catties, worth 9 million yen; and France accounted for 12,000 catties, worth 7 million yen. The United States accounts for more than 8/10. From January to October of the same year, the total exports of the United States were 1.342 billion US dollars, of which 242 million were to the United Kingdom, accounting for 1/10.8; 210 million to Canada, accounting for 1/10.6; 112 million to France, accounting for 0.8/10; and 106 million to Japan, slightly less than France, ranking fourth. Cotton, an important agricultural product of the United States, exported 8,918,000 dan in the same year, of which 2,239,000 dan were to Japan, accounting for 25%; 1,486,000 dan were to the United Kingdom, but Japan ranked first. From this point of view, Japan ranks first in the export of cotton from the United States, and the United States ranks first in the export of raw silk from Japan. If the United States blockades Japan, Japan's cotton textile industry and sericulture industry will be greatly affected, and the US silk weaving industry will also be in danger. Moreover, American farmers are already in very difficult circumstances, and the end of cotton exports will definitely make their livelihoods even worse. Therefore, from an economic point of view, the United States will not impose an economic blockade on Japan. The trade relations between the United Kingdom and Japan are not as close as those between the United States and Japan. In recent years, the United Kingdom's exports to Japan have shown a downward trend. For example, in 1930, the United Kingdom's total exports were 771 million pounds, of which Japan accounted for 8 million pounds; from January to September 1932, the total exports were 271 million pounds, of which Japan accounted for 4.4 million pounds; but it accounted for a little more than 5% of the total exports of the United Kingdom. During the same period, Japan's exports to the United Kingdom were 5 million pounds, compared with the United Kingdom's total imports of 520 million pounds, which is only a little more than 1%. Moreover, British cotton cloth and Japanese cotton cloth are in fierce competition. The following table shows the general situation of the power of British and Japanese cotton cloth in 1932, in millions of square yards.</p>
<p>To China: Japan 194, UK 125 To India: Japan 194, UK 125 To Africa: Japan 231, UK 281 To Southeast Asia: Japan 352, UK 44</p>
<p>From the above table, except for one place in Africa, the UK's power is not inferior to Japan, and it is certainly willing to take the opportunity of an economic blockade to drive out Japan's power. However, the facts are not that simple. Although Japan's trade relations with the UK are not deep, its trade volume with UK territories is very large, especially in Australia and India. In 1931, of India's total exports of 1.599 billion rupees, 140 million were to Japan, second only to the UK; in the same year, of India's total imports of 1.265 billion rupees, 103 million were imported from Japan. In terms of cotton, in the same year, India exported 423 million tons, of which Japan accounted for 193 million tons, while the UK only accounted for 30 million tons, only 1/6 of Japan. In 1931, Australia's total exports were 108 million pounds, of which 11.6 million pounds were to Japan, accounting for 18%; total imports were 57 million pounds, of which Japan accounted for 2.7 million pounds, about 5%. Australia is clearly in a favorable position. Australia's exports to Japan are mainly wool and wheat. In the same year, Japan imported 1 billion catties of wheat from Australia, accounting for more than 8/10 of the total wheat imports; and 149 million catties of wool, accounting for 97% of the total wool imports. And Australia's purchase of Japanese raw silk and silk fabrics is only 1/4 of the value of exports to Japan. If the UK decisively imposes an economic blockade on Japan, India's cotton and Australia's wheat and wool will definitely lose an important market, and the UK will definitely have considerable concerns. Moreover, in recent years, the Conservative Party has gained power, remembering the old friendship between the UK and Japan, and helping each other with Japan. India in the Far East also intends to entrust Japan with the joint guarantee, so the possibility of an economic blockade is even less. The situation of the UK and the US is as described above. Other countries, such as Germany, France, Italy, and Russia, either do not want to be nosy because of their shallow relationship, or are busy with their own construction and have no time to worry. Therefore, the second condition of economic blockade, a united front of the great powers, is also defeated.</p>
<p>The three sanctions of the League of Nations, namely expulsion, military sanctions, and economic blockade, are all ineffective. Then, is the General Assembly's resolution not just a piece of paper? The motivation for writing this article is definitely not to boost the morale of others and destroy our own ambition, but to hope that the Chinese people will break the mentality of relying on external assistance and seeking luck, recognize the objective economic facts, and seek a way out for themselves. Now, are we still waiting to die in the League of Nations? Or are we compromising with Japan and giving up our land? Or are we striving to resist violence? This requires our people to make their own decisions.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Foreign Goods Dumping and the National Economy by Ren Fengxin <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese goods have been dumped all over our country. According to the investigation by the Ministry of Industry, the dumped goods include six types: coal, yarn, cloth, rayon, paper, cement, and fish. The Chinese people should have a proper understanding of dumped foreign goods. Otherwise, they will be blinded by temporary small gains, resulting in a major disaster for the national economy and people's livelihood, which is no different from drinking poison to quench thirst, and regretting it will be too late. Therefore, I will explain the relationship between foreign goods dumping and our country's national economy for the benefit of the Chinese people, so that they can distinguish between gains and losses, consider the advantages and disadvantages, and avoid being exploited. Japan reduces the selling prices of coal, silk, paper, cement, and fish, and delivers them to Chinese merchants for import, who then sell them at low prices in the market. Consumers pay a small amount of money for the same goods compared to before the dumping. Those who do not know the truth think that they get the same goods with less money, which seems to be beneficial to Chinese consumers. But in reality, it is not entirely true. The duration of dumping varies. Dumping in foreign markets to sell excess production is called temporary dumping. Dumping with the aim of suppressing foreign merchants and monopolizing foreign countries is called short-term dumping. If dumping is done to maintain large-scale production and reduce costs, it is long-term dumping. Among these three types of dumping, only temporary dumping and long-term dumping are truly beneficial to consumers in the country being dumped on. As for the second type, short-term dumping, it is not only not beneficial to consumers, but also harmful. Recently, the dumping of foreign goods prevalent in our country is mostly short-term dumping. The recent dumping of Japanese goods is one example. Its intention is to suppress Chinese merchants and monopolize our market. The so-called price reduction and sale is neither to clear excess goods nor to maintain large-scale production, but to harbor the ambition of "aggression" and "plunder." This kind of short-term dumping takes dumping as a means and monopoly as the goal. Precisely because monopoly is the goal, they do not hesitate to first use the method of selling at reduced prices to please Chinese consumers. Once the opportunity is ripe, they will rise up and monopolize our market. At that time, they will definitely raise the market price to compensate for the damage suffered during dumping. At this point, Chinese consumers will have no choice but to tie their own hands and be slaughtered. In short, foreign goods dumping in our country is mostly short-term dumping. Although Chinese people can spend less money to get the same goods, which is beneficial to their daily lives, they do not know that this small gain is temporary and not permanent, a means and not an end. Lao Tzu said, "If you want to take away, you must first give." This is what he meant. Furthermore, from the perspective of the relationship between foreign goods dumping and the people's economic livelihood, normally, our country's production enterprises are very different from foreign enterprises. Regardless of capital organization, management technology, quality, or sales, our country's goods industry is inferior to foreign industries in every aspect. On the one hand, continuous years of war and national affairs are chaotic. The government is unable to and has no time to fulfill its responsibility of promoting and protecting. On the other hand, our country's goods industry is plagued by infighting, so self-sealing is also self-inflicted. Therefore, under normal circumstances, in other words, even if foreign goods do not use the dumping method, our country's goods industry is already in a disadvantageous position, just like a person with a terminal illness, even without being attacked, will not last long. Now, if foreign goods intensify and implement dumping, it is like adding fists and feet to a sick person, further accelerating the collapse of our country's goods industry. According to recent reports, the Kaiyuan Coal Mine has been severely affected by the dumping of Japanese coal, resulting in sluggish sales. This one example is enough to show the disadvantage of foreign goods dumping to our country's production industry. Under the current circumstances, if our country's goods industry wants to imitate foreign goods dumping, they lack the ability but have more than enough desire. Even if they reluctantly reduce prices to compete, in reality, it is no different from suicide. Why? Because our country's goods industry is inherently weak, coupled with the government's failure to protect it, and the lack of postnatal nurturing, forcing them to compete with the strong will inevitably lead to disaster. However, if they want to avoid competition and allow foreign goods dumping to run rampant, then a good market will be trampled on, the guest will usurp the host, and the harm will be endless. It is difficult to advance and difficult to retreat. The relationship between foreign goods dumping and our country's national economy is as described above. As for the countermeasures, I will write another article to discuss them.</p>
<h3 id="e197">International Trade and Tariff War by Chu Yu <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Today, the state of international trade worldwide is becoming increasingly chaotic. Since the fourth quarter of the 19th century, world tariff policies have gradually leaned towards protectionist trade, erecting high tariff barriers to prevent the import of foreign goods in order to develop domestic industries. This kind of protectionist trade has long been popular around the world. Because the import of foreign goods is a rapid means of economic aggression, countries have to increase tariffs in order to survive. However, international trade has become chaotic as a result. Since the European War, countries have been enthusiastically promoting the recovery of their national industries, but influenced by this high tariff policy and the instability of the gold standard, international trade has become uncertain. Recalling the autumn of the year before last, when the United Kingdom abandoned the gold standard, the prices of currencies in various countries changed drastically, and international trade caused major waves. The goods of countries with low currency prices, using the low foreign exchange rate as a weapon, suddenly developed vigorously into the markets of countries with high currency prices. This is a good strategy for countries that increase their exports, but in countries with higher currency prices, taking advantage of the low international exchange rate, the export of goods is mostly prevented by exchange rate dumping. For example, increasing tariff rates and establishing new dumping taxes have made the gold standard unstable. As a result, abnormal chaos has occurred in international trade. Therefore, today, all countries in the world are focusing on tariff policies to prevent the import of goods from countries with low exchange rates. Therefore, the protectionist tariff policy implemented in the past when international trade was in a state of equal and free competition is very different from today's tariff war. However, today's tariff war is all due to the instability of the gold standard. Since it cannot restore a stable market or eliminate hidden dangers, it has to be intensified to resist foreign countries. From this perspective, in today's chaotic era of international trade, the countries most affected by the so-called exchange rate dumping prevention案, increased tariff rates, and retaliatory tariff rates are those with drastically falling currency prices. Recently, the United States and France have been responding to the gold standard due to the concentrated change in gold, which has created obstacles to the international settlement. Countries with less gold reserves are striving for trade balance to avoid the outflow of gold, hence the emergence of trade management. For example, Argentina's import volume is less than the export volume, and Turkey is willing to abolish trade treaties rather than buy goods, all based on this policy. Trade management and similar policies are used to thoroughly prevent exchange rate dumping.</p>

<p>Yesterday, banks were still in the closing period and it was Sunday, and Chinese banks were also closed as usual, so the financial market was completely uninteresting. Therefore, the interbank interest rate had no market. Both morning and afternoon were open for white borrowing. Interbank bill transactions were 4.89 million in the morning and 670,000 in the afternoon. The Small General Association was 340,000. Qianzhuang (money shops) remitted over 29 million in foreign currency notes, and remittances from various routes were 560,000. Subsidiary coins (Jiangjiao) returned a small total of 866 yuan, which was 3 yuan less than the previous day. Transactions were only 5,000 jiao in the morning market. The market price was the same in the morning and afternoon. Guangdong jiao was 794 yuan in the morning market and 796 yuan and 5 jiao in the afternoon market. Transactions were 115,000 jiao in the morning market and 75,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins plus one thousand five hundred wen amounted to three hundred and six thousand wen.

<p>Monday to Wednesday: Quiet and sluggish</p>
<p>Thursday: Plunge due to rumors</p>
<p>Saturday: Improved atmosphere and rally</p>
<p>Result: Fell 2-3 jiao to 7-8 jiao</p>
<p>Last week, from April 10th to 15th, the public bonds market of the Chinese Securities Exchange, from an overall perspective, still did not break out of the circling pattern. Because the situation was still brewing, the war situation on the surface was still very intense, and the voices for peace had not been cut off. Both long and short sides had their own views and watched each other, waiting for the opportunity. Therefore, from Monday to Wednesday, the market was quiet and sluggish. Market prices fluctuated up and down, with daily gains and losses of only 3-4 jiao to 5 jiao. Large investors rarely entered or exited. On Thursday and Friday, there were suddenly rumors on the market about the Southwest. Guangbang frantically sold off issues 40 and 54, and issue 38 also had long positions exiting. Some longs also rolled over their positions. Retail investors also wavered and sold off with the market. It was generally believed that retail investors were biased towards the long side, so most were shorting. The market price then fell for two consecutive days, showing no sign of stabilizing. Fortunately, issues 16, 17, 27, and 21, as well as the Northern Gang, bought in small amounts to resist the decline. However, the market price fell by as much as 2 yuan. On Saturday, Minister Song had agreed to attend the Washington Conference, and all disputes between China and Japan could be resolved there. Short covering and rollover transactions were prevalent in the market, and market prices suddenly moved, with a uniform rally of several jiao to one yuan. Summarizing the week's market price results, it fell by only 2-3 jiao to 7-8 jiao compared to the previous week. However, as the April futures delivery gradually approached, the next week should be more lively. The total transaction volume was 38,046,000 yuan, including 16,000 yuan in spot goods and 38,030,000 yuan in futures. Among them, the Unified Supervision Tax accounted for the most at 14,380,000 yuan, followed by Disarmament at 5,740,000 yuan, the 19 Customs Tax and 20 Customs Tax totaling 7,300,000 yuan, the 20 Customs Tax and 20 Customs Tax accounting for 8,020,000 yuan, the Compilation Remnant also had 1,480,000 yuan, the 18 Customs Tax had 530,000 yuan, and the Whole Six had 400,000 yuan. These two types of transactions were the least. The 18 Customs Tax lost its speculative nature due to the absolutely small number of accounts. The Whole Six was rarely traded, often unable to be transacted due to the lack of counter parties, so those who held a small number were all of an investment nature. 10 shares of the Exchange's stock were traded at a price of 40 yuan. The merger issue between the Exchange and the Chinese Exchange has been substantially resolved and the measures can be announced after the extraordinary shareholders' meeting on the 30th.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the 10th, due to heavy rain, there were few customers, and the number of transactions was very few. Due to the rain and the closure of the customs on Sunday, only over 300 dan of rice were traded. Therefore, the market situation showed a stable but sluggish trend. The prices of Sutong Gang and Nangang Qingjiao rice were unchanged. Duyangjian and Yinyuan rice were tight, and the market was neither prosperous nor declining.</p>

<h3 id="e204">False Passage <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>Speaking of "false passage," we would think of the trick that Duke Xian of Jin used to destroy the State of Yu during the Spring and Autumn period. This is truly a terrible conspiracy, making people wary of it even after three thousand years.</p>
<p>Recently, the resistance against Japan has been very tense. According to reports, the three provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi have sent troops north to resist Japan. It was originally planned to concentrate in Shaoguan and go north jointly through Guangzhou. The 19th Route Army in Fujian has already ordered mobilization. "Unexpectedly, the military authorities in Guangdong Province suddenly raised the issue of the 19th Route Army's 'false passage' through Dongjiang, and sent a telegram to Cai Tingkai, saying, 'A paper currency crisis has occurred in this province. If a large army passes through, the public may not understand the truth and cause misunderstandings, which will affect the future of the Guangdong situation.' Later, it also hinted to the Shantou Municipal Party Department to issue this same telegram to support its claim?" (April 10, a certain newspaper)</p>
<p>Who would have thought that the passage of a large army resisting Japan would cause "misunderstandings" among the public and affect the "future of the Guangdong situation"? The public is truly ignorant of the "resisting Japan" plan, and the disaster of national subjugation is inevitable. What is strange is that the Shantou Municipal Party Department, which is the "vanguard for the people," actually issued this "same telegram" to "support its claim," which is quite suspicious of the current situation. It is likely that this "vanguard" is "slacking off" at the front line. Since the vanguard is slacking off, the "rearguard" will also "rest" or "turn backwards," and a comedy of resisting Japan will come to an end.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the public is all "idiots," but the Guangdong military authorities' respect for public opinion is commendable. With these idiots, there will naturally be no shortage of Zhuge Liangs. "Guest troops"! Please note that this does not refer to the troops of the United States, Britain, or France, so please do not misunderstand! Entry is quite fearful, especially since there is such a terrible precedent in history. It is said that the person who paints horses paints them in his own image, so the fear of Zhuge Liang and others is perhaps even greater than that of ordinary idiots.</p>
<p>"Resisting Japan" is for the country, and the "country" belongs to everyone, but the "province" belongs to us. Isn't this relationship even closer? Moreover, the Japanese imperialist's shells have not yet landed on Guangzhou City. According to the true meaning of "resisting on the spot," there is no need for this. At least it is too early, so if I were the Guangdong military authorities, I would definitely not hesitate and honestly say, "If you want to resist Japan, this road is blocked." There is no need to "hint," and there is no need for others to "support my claim." Wouldn't that be straightforward? The so-called "future" and "impact" and other incomprehensible topics can also be left unsaid.</p>
<p>Living in China in the 20th century, everything is a bit confusing. Not to mention that foreigners find it incomprehensible, such as the troops of a country, and there is something called "false passage," which even we ourselves do not understand very well. Alas, I have been a citizen of the Republic of China for more than twenty years, and I am so ignorant of the "Party" and "country" affairs. Will I eventually become an "idiot"?</p>
<h3 id="e205">Memories of Tomb Sweeping by Bin Fu <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Every year on the third day of the third lunar month, the weather always seems to be clear. My family has a tradition of tomb sweeping on this day. We are from W Township, but due to various conveniences, we live in N City, which is forty li from Z Township. There is a short train ride between Z Township and N City. The forty-li distance only takes thirty minutes. Therefore, every year when we go to sweep the tombs in our hometown, we often take the early train on the third day of the third lunar month. As usual, after arriving at Z Township, we first go to sweep the tombs of our great-great-grandparents. Besides my family, there are also four families of relatives participating. We were originally a large clan in the countryside, and our group is just one branch of the large clan. This branch is divided into five families. When the people from the five families come together, there are quite a few of them. Add to that dozens of porters, servants, and musicians blowing loudly, "di-di-da-da," instantly decorating the lonely fields with a lively atmosphere. The nearby cowherds and peasant women stop their work and gather around, as if something important has happened. The ceremony is very grand when worshipping at the tomb. In addition to a chief celebrant (the chief celebrant is often my father), there are two assistant celebrants, and a eulogist. This eulogy is almost always the same every year. After the worship, there are several sounds of "pi-li-pa-la, peng" from the firecrackers. These sounds often startle the lazy cows sleeping under the willow trees, causing them to jump up. After a burst of "pi-pa," many cowherds gather to snatch the remnants of the small firecrackers, often leading to fierce fights. These things were what interested me the most at the time. At that time, I thought that the meaning of tomb sweeping was just that. We would have lunch at our old house, which is what is known as "distributing the sacrificial meat." After lunch, our family would set off to my grandfather's tomb. The spring sun shone brightly in the sky. Although it was spring, it was already enough to make us sweat. My grandfather's tomb was in a field outside the north gate of Z Township. The flavor of the countryside was naturally even stronger there. The deep, dark forest and the babbling streams filled even a child like me with endless joy. My father held a cane in one hand and recited poems in a low voice, walking steadily through the winding wheat fields. My older brother and I followed silently behind. At this time, except for the buzzing of bees or the voices of people on the hillside, everything was quiet. Even the talkative dogs were mostly sleeping soundly in the middle of the road. When we arrived at the tomb, the caretaker had already arranged the incense, candles, and sacrificial offerings. As soon as he saw my father, he would eagerly report how the stone in front of the tomb had been stolen by someone, and how the pine tree behind the tomb had been blown down by the wind. In the end, my father would always agree to give him some money and ask him to fix it. This was almost an annual routine. After the worship, my father would wander silently in front of the tomb, his face full of deep melancholy. As for me? I was busy picking grass, picking flowers, catching bees, and chasing butterflies, because at the time, I only thought that this was the true meaning of tomb sweeping.</p>
<p>Last year in March, I went to my hometown to sweep the tomb again. The mountains were still green, and the sparkling waves of Z Lake outside the north gate were still beautiful, but my heart was no longer open! Between Z Lake and my grandfather's tomb, a new grave had been added. There, my beloved father was resting.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>I stood and sighed, the waves reflected my lonely shadow. It was at this moment that I finally understood that the sorrow my father felt had become my turn. In the twilight, I looked back at the desolate new tomb, and I couldn't help but feel heartbroken!</p>

<p>— Lin Yuexuan</p>
<p>Walking with skirt sashes to Longhua, breaking willows and climbing peaches, the joy is inexhaustible,</p>
<p>In the village, sad cries as spring departs, smoke rises from chimneys in many homes.</p>
<p>Pagoda shadows and bell sounds separate the city's clamor, a gentle breeze carries wine flags askew,</p>
<p>Peach blossoms with pale cheeks and red tears, every Qingming Festival weep blood in China.</p>
<p>Half the river's surface bears the Rising Sun Flag, after all, this famous spot is far from barbarian influence,</p>
<p>What do tourists remember while treading the green? This year seems better than years past.</p>
<p>The Han camp is still by the willow shade, heroic deeds remain, arousing tears,</p>
<p>Frequent alarms of war on the frontier, the spring countryside desolate with apricot blossom smoke. (Moved to donate to the volunteer army)</p>

<p>— Shadow Dull</p>
<p>To advocate for women's rights, the primary prerequisite is undoubtedly to demand that women have freedom in social careers and economic independence. Only then can women in general escape various sufferings and constraints. In China, the call for women's rights has been going on for quite a few years. The pioneers who advocate for women's movements are all shouting slogans to go into society and strive for equal rights for men and women in their careers. However, in reality, most Chinese women are still immersed in a life of drunken dreams, and dependence is still deeply rooted in their hearts. They believe that once married, everything they need in life will be provided by their husbands, so there is no need for women to worry. As a result, their daily lives consist of nothing but eating, sleeping, and playing.</p>
<p>Here, just talking about the lives of a few teachers' wives next door can show how comfortable their lives are and how they usually don't worry about anything. Mrs. Zhao, who lives to the east, her husband, Mr. Zhao, is a middle-level employee in a foreign firm, earning about a hundred yuan a month. Mrs. Li, who lives next door to the west, her husband, Mr. Li, is a secretary in an organization, and his monthly income is probably no more than a hundred yuan. These two gentlemen are equally busy working every day, but when it comes to the lives of these two teachers' wives, they are too comfortable, right? Even the wife of a president is probably not as comfortable as they are.</p>
<p>These two teachers' wives sleep until lunchtime at the earliest every day. Although the Zhao family doesn't hire anyone, Mr. Zhao's mother, who is over sixty years old, takes care of all the housework by herself every day, from cooking and washing clothes to emptying the chamber pot. It is said that although she is nominally Mr. Zhao's mother, she actually works like a horse all day long, simply being a female servant who doesn't need to be paid. The Li family hires a middle-aged maid to do all the housework, so these two teachers' wives don't have to worry about any household chores.</p>
<p>When the sun is high and the rice in the kitchen is cooked, the teachers' wives lazily get out of bed, have lunch, and then invite a few wives from the east and west to play a few rounds of mahjong. If there are three missing, they get dressed up and go out to listen to storytelling or wildly visit theaters. When they come back in the evening, have dinner, and then, if they can get a game going, they play round after round. Playing mahjong is more important than eating, and they don't feel satisfied if they don't play every day. They play until at least two or three in the morning before going to sleep. Because they go to sleep so late, they naturally can't get up early. Mr. Zhao and Mr. Li get up early to go to work, disturbing the blankets and waking up the teachers' wives, who scold them for disturbing their sleep. What's even more hateful is that old man who doesn't know what's good for him, knocking on the door early in the morning, always waking up the teachers' wives' good dreams, so how can they not scold him a few times? After the old man leaves and the gentlemen go out, the teachers' wives can finally sleep until lunchtime without being disturbed anymore. I think if we were to examine the lives of the teachers' wives, their daily courses would almost always revolve around eating, sleeping, playing cards, and having fun, right? How comfortable!</p>
<h3 id="e208">The Front Line is Peaceful and Quiet <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Quiet</p>
<p>The Japanese imperialists' Manchurian policy was realized without lifting a finger, which was truly unexpected. Unexpectedly, the Young Marshal adopted a policy of non-resistance and gave away the three northeastern provinces, and Rehe was no exception. Upon hearing of the defeat at Xifengkou, they were unwilling to lag behind (and hastily moved their belongings), fleeing before the battle. As a result, Chengde fell into their hands again. The facts were exactly the same, with a "gentlemanly" air of yielding. However, from another perspective, there are some differences. After the loss of the three northeastern provinces, we only heard empty calls to "recover lost territory," but in reality, we did not see a single soldier or general mobilized by the Young Marshal or anyone else. This time, however, after the fall of Chengde, the "national heroes" Generals Sun and Song effectively emulated "a full martial performance," engaging in single-handedly close combat, which was a great spectacle for a while. Although it was a very short scene that did no harm to Japanese imperialism, they still put on a show, which was more "dignified" than the previous "silence." Of course, the result was still the same, the lost territory remained lost, with no hope of recovery. Furthermore, due to some kind of relationship, both sides have already ceased hostilities. As some important figure said, "There is not much contact between the main forces of both sides now." In other words, it will soon be peaceful and quiet, which suits the common people who love peace and celebrate the coming of peace. However, upon opening the newspaper, it is clear that the god of war has not disappeared, but continues to be active. However, this time the focus of the war is not on the outside but has shifted back to the inside. Some say that this is to implement the principle of "internal pacification before external resistance," which is only natural and beyond dispute. Moreover, at a time when the government and the people are united (?), the whole country is united (?), and jointly facing national difficulties, there are actually bandits who disregard the overall situation and specialize in making trouble. Taking advantage of the loss of Chengde, they launched a major offensive, causing the deaths and injuries of dozens of officers at all levels of the bandit suppression forces. Not to mention the lower-ranking soldiers, they even have the potential to seize Fuzhou and Nanchang. It is said that those foolish men who fall one after another are not as clever as the bandit suppression forces, knowing all kinds of combat plans, such as luring the enemy deep, and using the strategy of releasing them in order to capture them. Therefore, the actual loss of troops and territory is just bait to lure the enemy, and there is no need to worry about it. Moreover, there are so many bandit suppression forces, and the land is so vast, so what does it matter if a few divisions of troops and a few cities are lost? Furthermore, the officials of the government have long seen this, and are currently deploying troops and generals, sitting in town and inspecting, and will soon engage in relentless killing, and internal pacification will be achieved one day.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can also see the Japanese imperialists' deep understanding of righteousness, not engaging in the act of taking advantage of the fire, but stopping their ambitious aggression under the government's repeated statements that they will not "directly negotiate," sign "humiliating treaties," and the policy of "long-term resistance." They gave up occupying Tianjin and Beijing, so that the government officials could first pacify the interior, and then compete with them, which is extremely generous. Therefore, the "peaceful and quiet on the front line" mentioned here, without the need for the humble writer to describe, can naturally be imagined.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Shop Assistant Communication: Bereaved Families in War Zones <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Since your column was created to answer the difficult questions of shop assistants, we, as shop assistants, have gained great convenience. I have a question to ask and sincerely hope that you will not hesitate to share your valuable opinion and answer it in detail. A relative of mine, Mr. So-and-so, established a rice store with friends on a certain road in Zhabei a few years ago. At first, the business was very good. Unexpectedly, during the January 28 Incident, except for the three people who worked in the store and were also shareholders, who were spared because they did not live in the store, the rest were captured by the Japanese army. There is no news of them, and they have probably already become victims under the iron hooves of the brutal Japanese. After the war was settled and the agreement was reached, after the war zone was opened, the rice stored in the store was used to repay the creditors. The other shareholders, in view of the fact that the outstanding debts reached as much as 17,000 or 18,000 yuan, although the accounts were scattered and several thousand yuan had to be paid in debts, the entire share capital should not be completely lost, so they decided to resume business. When they gathered several times to discuss, they did not notify the families of the victims. Later, because the victims were all young and strong men, and their families relied on their income to maintain their lives, it is easy to imagine their tragic situation after they were killed. The families, compelled by hunger and cold, went to see the shareholders several times, asking for relief and a small amount of condolence money. However, the shopkeepers always pushed each other, procrastinating. How could a family of old, weak women and children prevail against men who are well-versed in worldly affairs? We do not know how much money they have collected now, whether there is any surplus after repaying the debts, or whether it is insufficient. Even if it is said that there is no surplus in the share capital, should they not be responsible for providing compensation to the shop assistants who died due to store affairs? Now they have temporarily suspended business, changed the name of the store, reorganized new shares, and reopened, hoping to shirk their responsibility for compensating the victims.</p>
<p>Sir, do you think it is fair that those who have not suffered can still clothe themselves, feed themselves, and take what they need, while the widows and orphans of the victims receive no profit at all?</p>
<p>Sir, do you think the families of the victims can ask them for compensation? And how should they ask them? What if they ignore them? Please give me an answer quickly, and I will be very grateful. With this, I wish you</p>
<p>Good health.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Wan Mengjie</p>
<p>× × ×</p>
<p>Editor's Note: From this letter, we see a very suspicious thing: why were the three people who worked in the store and were also shareholders spared? Were they not usually living in the store? Or are shareholders more free than shop assistants, so they can take precautions in case of emergency and not live in the store? If their escape from disaster was entirely due to taking precautions, then this can prove that the shop assistants' tragic experience was entirely due to their loyalty to the shareholders. Although I did not kill Boren, Boren died because of me. The shareholders should do their best to comfort their bereaved families. If their "not living in the store" was a habit, their survival was truly lucky. Then, of course, another discussion is necessary. We, the common people, cannot go to the main culprit, the Japanese, to settle accounts individually. However, the government, based on its position of "building on the people," must ask them to pay a huge sum of money to provide relief. Fortunately, there is an overall plan for resisting Japan and saving the country, and final victory is assured. In the future, you may as well go to Japan to settle accounts completely. In addition, there are also some groups and public organizations that have devised many methods and raised many funds to provide relief to disaster victims in war zones. The income from a single batch of large champagne tickets is already very alarming. Since you are disaster victims in war zones, you can ask about their whereabouts. If the families of war-stricken people do not receive the benefit of this money, no matter how open your accounts are or how thorough your procedures are, it will inevitably make people suspicious. At the very least, the fault of unequal distribution is undeniable!</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The patriotic movement is a manifestation that every citizen should have, and it can also be said to be within the scope of college students. In theory, there is no possibility of any problems occurring at all. However, the mysterious and contradictory Chinese politics are extremely inverted and want to prohibit it. Among the general college students, there are often many "political larvae" with sharp heads from childhood who manipulate in the middle, using petitions and parades as tools for a certain party to squeeze out a certain faction. This makes the government authorities have more and more excuses to stop them. The students become more and more reluctant to let him prohibit it. The claims of both sides are getting further and further apart, and they each go to extremes. Then the person who suffers is the president of the school. On the one hand, he always speaks official language, trying his best to hold him responsible for stopping the student movement and banning strikes. On the other hand, he is filled with full enthusiasm and swears to death not to obey interference. If your attitude is slightly uncongenial, new titles such as "bureaucrat" and "running dog" will immediately stop him. × There are many college students, the components are complex, and the location is in the capital. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the patriotic movement is more severe than other schools. Although Wu Yi is an elderly person, the grief and anger he holds for the Japanese beast army's strong occupation of the three northeastern provinces is really not inferior to that of young people. Therefore, he completely adopts a laissez-faire policy for the students' gatherings, parades, and speeches, without any restrictions. Needless to say, his irresponsible attitude is of course not satisfactory to the government authorities. Several important people in power have turned to teach people to send several warnings to him. Liang, his top student × Minister, has also repeatedly said that he should try to restrict the students' actions. However, his reply is always a cold saying, "Restrict it after the country is destroyed." Later, his top student was also annoyed, and meant to ask his old man to go back to his mansion to rest. However, the students all became his supporters, and for a time, he had no way to deal with it.</p>
<p>"I would rather sacrifice everything, but the patriotic movement must not be destroyed," Wu Dashuan often declared to people very resolutely. "President, please go to the auditorium to hold a meeting. We want to deal with a scoundrel who damages our overall reputation and obstructs the cargo inspection movement." One afternoon, the student union suddenly sent two cadres to report a shocking message to Wu Yi. "Is there really such a thing?" "Why isn't it true!" The two cadres confirmed in unison. "Good! Of course it should be dealt with. I will go right away." Wu Yi also expressed twelve points of anger and hurried to put on a pair of tortoiseshell glasses with a very deep degree, and then followed the two students, and ran to the auditorium. "Ding Ling...

<h3 id="e213">A Glimpse into the Psychology of Hollywood Movie Stars Adopting Adopted Children <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Rong</p>
<p>The trend of adopting "adopted children" prevailed in Hollywood last year. This trend has continued into this year, and the latest person to adopt an "adopted child" is Frederic March, the protagonist of the film "The Royal Family of Broadway." Recently, he published his opinion on adopting "adopted children," which vividly depicts the psychology of a loving couple, as if it were about to jump off the paper. It can be seen that after marriage, people all over the world who have not had children for many years are prone to a kind of empty boredom or the terror of having no descendants. This psychology of "no descendants is the greatest unfilial act," or the regret of "no child under the knee," is not limited to us Chinese people who value filial piety.</p>
<p>Frederic March adopted an adopted daughter, named Penelope, nicknamed Penny. Frederic March married the famous actress Florence Eldridge six or seven years ago, but has not had any children to this day. When Eldridge married Frederic March, she was prepared to sacrifice her life's career to build a beautiful family with Frederic March. However, a family without children is not a family. So, after their marriage, after a year or two of not having a son, Eldridge became extremely depressed. She wanted to adopt an adopted child, but at that time, Frederic March still didn't believe that they would have their own son. Why adopt someone else's child as their own? So he tactfully rejected her request. But year after year passed, until three or four years, five or six years, the stork that delivers children never landed on their house. Eldridge then became gaunt and mentally distraught due to her longing for children. Frederic March then became panicked. So they agreed with each other that if another year passed and there was still no sign of having children, they would definitely adopt an adopted child to entertain them.</p>
<p>Another year passed like this, and finally there was no news. They began the search for an adopted child. Because Eldridge wanted a son, she became infatuated when she saw a boy less than two months old and decided to adopt him. Frederic also liked the child very much, but there was one flaw: the child didn't seem like their own, because Frederic March and Eldridge had brown hair, while the child had blond hair. While they were hesitating, a friend found them a newborn girl. When they went to take a look, they were both extremely surprised.</p>
<p>It turned out that the girl had brown hair and big eyes, and her appearance was very similar to Frederic March. They thought that they would definitely be able to treat her as their own in the future, so they decided to take her back. Frederic March still feels happy when he thinks about the first time he met the girl. He said, "It's very strange. When she saw us, it was as if she knew that she would belong to us in the future. She smiled happily. She was only three weeks old at that time, but she could already recognize her future parents. People who see her face will definitely know that she is our own child, or even better than our own child."</p>
<p>Frederic March does not believe in heredity very much, so when they adopted this adopted child, they did not thoroughly investigate who her parents were. However, he knows that the background before her birth was good, so there will be no bad impression on the girl's mind in the future.</p>
<p>There is also a question: when Penny grows up, should she be told that she is adopted? Frederic March and Eldridge agree to wait until she is older and understands things before telling her. He said that this can make her happier, because adopted children themselves have nothing unnameable, and she does not need to feel ashamed because of it. However, if this fact is not explained to her and is hidden, she will think of it as something unpleasant in the future after hearing someone tell her, and her relationship with her parents will be broken because of it.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Review of "All American" <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The plot is chaotic, but the photography is quite good.</p>
<p>A good film must have a good script as its backbone. Although this kind of script can also be based on extremely ordinary events, it should have its own value regardless. The current American film is obviously already mired in the deep mud pit that they have dug themselves, and may never find a more proper way out. Although a small number of works can still allow the audience to recognize considerable meaning in front of the screen, most of the works are obviously tending towards chaos.</p>
<p>As far as this film "All American" is concerned, after I reluctantly opened my sleepy eyes and finished watching it, I tried my best to search in my memory, but I still couldn't understand what this film told me.</p>
<p>The story is roughly like this: a "baseball king" suddenly changes his mind and engages in commerce, which is quite opposed by his fiancée. In the business world, due to his past "reputation," he accidentally gains the favor of a rich businessman's daughter, and a romance inevitably occurs. From then on, he is addicted to alcohol, sex, and gambling, and even becomes poor. Afterwards, he finally changed his past mistakes and regained victory on the baseball field. So, of course, he reunited with his fiancée and made peace.</p>
<p>What does this tell us? At most, it is to save people from going astray. Moreover, the story structure is also loose and mediocre, without twists and turns, rigorous, and without a relatively clear system. Regarding the performance, the director can be said to be too ordinary.</p>
<p>He doesn't know how to make the whole play rise and fall, how to approach the climax. He makes the unnecessary and dull scenes as long as possible, which simply cannot stimulate the audience or lift the audience's spirits. There are a few relatively novel shots, but he repeats them again and again. The few jokes interspersed are also so dull that they are only tolerable. Only the woman's crying is still clever. In terms of performance, except for Richard Arlen, the rest are not worth mentioning, but they are still perfunctory.</p>
<p>However, this film also has something worth noting, which is the commendable photography. The entire picture is so bright and clear, and the few night shots are also limited to being wonderful. Of course, the flexibility of the lighting can be seen very clearly in the picture. The sound is also relatively pure, but this is originally the more special place of American films.</p>
<p>Audience Opinion</p>
<h3 id="e215">Overall Review of "The Cry of Women" <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Zheng Bai</p>
<p>After "City Nights" and "Metropolitan Morning," here comes "The Cry of Women." Of course, this is also a big film, so there are also many foreign reviews. Standing on the position of cherishing domestic films, the Shenbao Film Special Issue is very willing to disclose as many of the dazzling submissions as possible. Unfortunately, our space is limited, so we can only select the more pertinent ones and excerpt a few. Therefore, thousands of words are often submitted, but only a few words are disclosed here, or no words are disclosed at all. I hope those who read and cherish this journal will forgive me.</p>
<p>Bu Zheng Bai</p>
<h3 id="e216">Just a Shout <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qun</p>
<p>I think the deficiency is that there is only a kind of forward tendency in this story, but there is no concrete and active action. Because its object is only in "cry," only shouting "What is our future?" Although the subtitles also indicated that "personal struggle will fail, get stronger and then struggle," but how to get stronger? How to cooperate? How to struggle? This is not answered here at all. Knowing the cause of the disease but not writing the prescription, the result is only to make our Lotus a camel who does not know where he is going. (The fact is like this)</p>
<p>Speaking of skills, the director has several clever techniques, such as a birdcage interspersed three times in the play, and each time has a different meaning. Also, the close-ups of the whistle twice and the comparison of wiping powder and wiping sweat are extremely fine and legal, and help the stimulation of the plot a lot.</p>
<p>As for the performance, Wang Ying is still considered qualified, but there are a few places where she performed too weakly (such as when her parents died and when her sister died). This is probably because she was timid when she first appeared on the screen? Long Jianong and Gu Meijun have few scenes, so you can't see any flaws. Wang Jiting and Tan Zhiyuan's faces are full of drama, too ostentatious. The other actors are neither good nor bad.</p>
<p>In short, "The Cry of Women" has not jumped over the title at all. It is only a cry of oppressed women.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Crying Out for "Cry" <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Hong</p>
<p>When we see the words "Women's Cry," we immediately think of the phrase "Hedong Lion's Roar," making those comrades with Ji Chang-phobia tremble as if they were innocent but condemned to death. What an imposing name! However, after reading the explanation, we realize it's a misunderstanding. Because the "women" in this film are crying out against a dark society, not challenging us "men," so we can rest assured and wait for this woman's demonstrative cry! But after watching the film, we are disappointed again, because inside there is only a weak woman, being slaughtered and oppressed by the dark society, they only have a heart to submit, sad tears, and no perseverance to resist and spirit to fight. The only one who can give us a little practical guidance is Ye Lian. And her ending is so tragic! Such pain and oppression, we can see it anytime and anywhere, so there is no need for the film to introduce it. What we want to know now is, how should women under this oppression rise up to fight and cry out, the script should give us a bright path and great instructions. If it's just like this, it would be a disappointment to this great naming!</p>
<h3 id="e218">He Said "Very Worth Seeing" <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Cheng</p>
<p>After watching it, the images are still good. The script can also be said to have considerable advantages, but it cannot be said to be fully successful, because there are still several places that are inappropriate, not profound, and unrealistic. For example, female students are easily deceived, the perpetrator of the car accident is easily let go, and the exposure of the exploitation of poor female workers only focuses on the food allowance; but there has never been a scene or a slogan regarding capital oppression. The director is even worse than the script, especially the robbery is too childish and sloppy.</p>
<p>The explanations are all very appropriate, and some sentences are really satisfying. The actors are all working hard, but Wang Ying, who plays Ye Lian, has a shallow expression, but she's on the screen for the first time! Wang Jiting's movements are a bit too casual. Tan Zhiyuan is too over the top, just like in The Flower of Freedom and Mad Current. In short, this film is very worth seeing.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Discussion Regarding the Two-Person Oriental Vehicle in the "Madame Butterfly" Film <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Deng LiYuan's letter and Mr. Ling He's reply published in the newspaper on the 12th, I feel there are things I cannot affirm, so I specially bring up this question again for discussion. According to the time and background taken in the film "Madame Butterfly," it is about twenty or thirty years ago, when Japan was still in the Meiji era. Mr. Li Yuan said that he spent more than ten years of his childhood in Japan, I don't know if it was during the Meiji era? Although I dare not call myself a Japan expert, nor have I carefully examined the history and customs of that country, but I have indeed seen two-seater Oriental vehicles with my own eyes. These cars initially used wooden wheels, and later rubber wheels were used. Because two people were sitting, one person had to pull and one person had to push in order to pull it. At that time (ie the Meiji era), maids accompanying young ladies or two men sitting in this kind of car could be seen everywhere. Then the author of the film should be admired for being able to examine the Japanese customs so carefully. I feel that it is inappropriate for Mr. Ling He to deny it arbitrarily without careful examination.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Cold-Faced Comedy Can No Longer Be Obtained <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>The works of the old-fashioned cold-faced comedian, Paskal, compared with the works of Chaplin, have a different flavor. Especially the works after co-starring with Mr. Big Nose Jimmy Durante. It can best make the viewer feel like eating olives after watching it, with a rich aftertaste. However, the unfortunate news came that Paskal has decided to resign from MGM and has decided to leave the screen life from now on. It is really a misfortune for Hollywood and also a misfortune for movie fans.</p>
<p>Paskal has been with MGM for ten years. His early years were very obscure as a minimum actor, but after joining MGM, he went smoothly. Relying on his natural quirkiness and a long face with big eyes, Paskal's name was known to women and children in Europe and the United States in the silent film era. The country that welcomed his films the most was Britain. When sound films came out, Paskal once failed. Later, after his film University Professor with Jimmy Durante was released, Paskal was able to surpass his previous reputation. I don't know why he is retiring now. There are still eight months until the end of MGM's contract, but Paskal is willing to compensate for the losses and destroy the contract, which shows that his determination to leave has been made.</p>

<p>— Mei Hua</p>
<p>At this time, Xiao Falov knew that his plan to support Princess Da Laka Nuo Hua had been exposed, but he still sneaked back to Russia. Olov had understood that this trick was planned by Xiao Falov, but he was inconvenienced to investigate further, fearing that if the matter got out of hand, Princess Da Laka Nuo Hua's life would be in danger! He looked again at her delicate, pitiful, and dying appearance, and remembered how they snuggled together every day in Italy, talking about love, and felt extremely uncomfortable in his heart! But it was too late for regret! From her suffering, he thought of Xiao Falov. If it weren't for Xiao Falov, who came up with this trick, how could she have become a princess, and how could she have suffered this set of evil tortures? Thinking about it, he tried to find Xiao Falov! Olov said to Xiao Falov: "She is already regretting it, so I released her. You take her to Princess Bo Xidi's monastery and let her know everything, so that she won't always be dreaming pink dreams!" In Princess Bo Xidi's secluded monastery, a young girl who looked similar to her came this day. Although their appearances were similar, their personalities were absolutely different! Princess Bo Xidi's heart was as cold as ice and as clear as water: but Da Laka Nuo Hua, although she had suffered supreme pain, was still alive and full of fresh life! Only when Princess Bo Xidi sat beside her, softly and gently, and told her everything that had happened, did she realize that she was just a Gypsy girl. What Princess Da Laka Nuo Hua was, was all Xiao Falov's trick!</p>
<p>She hated Xiao Falov, she forgave Olov, she didn't know what to do! And Princess Bo Xidi, after telling her everything in detail, also felt infinite sadness, and two hot tears dripped from her eyes! Everyone was equally lonely and equally helpless, and they unconsciously treated her like a biological sister, but Da Laka Nuo Hua could no longer be as lively as before, and sing that lingering Gypsy love song!
