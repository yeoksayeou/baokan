<h3 id="c5">最後之决心穗 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>邇近由於華盛方面之表示願意開始談判戰債。以及英日在華北利益發生衝突。歐美間之關係。顯然漸趨接近。縱横捭闔之國際政局。亦顯然漸次轉捩其方向。在此種轉捩之下。國際聯盟乃亦轉變其兩年來維持［日本遠東政策］之態度。於本月二十四日毅然以［四十二對一］通過十九委會所草擬之報告。予日本以嚴正之指摘。予［滿洲僞國］以正式之否認。此種堅决嚴正之態度。誠足以使世人耳目爲之煥然一新。</p>
<p>國際聯盟對日態度之改變。其根本原因。仍在於列强相互間之利益衝突。換言之。國際政治之種種形。相實即爲［帝國主義内在矛盾］之顯示。故吾人於當前之國際局勢。旣不能誤認爲［公理今已戰勝强權。］尤不能誤認爲［列强今皆助。我］但使吾人而果眞有爲民族生存而鬭爭之决心。則當前之國際局勢。實即爲我國以最大之决心實際總動員自救之絕好機會也。　　熱河方面之悲壯爭鬭。今已開始。沿海沿江各地。都杌揑不安。隨時有被襲擊擾亂之可能。我政府在當前情勢之下。應出其最後最大之决心昭示全國以一貫之方針。而後全國人民乃得集中力量。以爲政府後盾猶記甲午戰後。外人謂此戰非［中國一國］對日本作戰。而爲［直隷一省］對日作戰。非爲直隷一省對日作戰。直爲［李鴻章個人］對日作戰吾人鑒此覆轍。則又深懼熱河方面之悲壯鬭。終將在敵人［各個擊破］之一策略下。歸於悲壯失敗。終將爲一二八淞滬血戰之績。</p>
<p>此次代行政院長宋子文氏偕張學良氏親往熱河視察前線。並激勵士氣。據電訊所傳。前敵將士及人民氣勢爲之一振。可徴今日我國之人民。實非亡國之人民。徒以以前政府舉棋莫定。戰和莫决。故欲救國而莫由自效。宋氏在熱河歡迎會中演説有曰。［政府决不放棄東北。决不放棄熱河。］復言［强］盜臨門。惟一的生路。即爲武力自衛。］果宋氏此種堅决之表示。而眞可以代表政府之態度。則吾人敢請蔣委員長目前暫委其江西方面之責任於其他大員。立時親臨前線。撫退策勉。蓋此不僅更足以激勵士氣。堅其抗日之决心。抑且全國人民在此種堅决行動之下。亦皆將仰望旌旗。歡呼踴躍以共赴民族革命鬭爭。</p>
<p>雖然國危至此。爲此爲亡。已間不容髮我人民固亦不能長此因循坐待也。在當前情勢之下。吾人已堅决認定。非鬭爭不足以遏止日帝國主義者之侵略。非鬭爭不足以維護自身之生存。非實行反日帝國主義之民族革命戰爭。不能求得我民族生存之出路。則我人民今日。即應一致動員。以大衆之力量。堅强政府之後盾。并以堅定政府之意志。同時更以大衆之力量。充實民族爭鬭之戰線。去歲一二八月餘血戰。雖極光榮悲壯。然而此戰中强横之主要人物。則終賴韓人之一擊。予以有力之膺懲。意者惟亡國遺民。身膺劇痛。而其反抗之意志乃愈堅决。而行動乃愈壯烈乎。吾人切盻國人。趁此國尚未亡。急起挽救。母待國旣亡欲挽救而莫由。今日之事。鬭爭而已。政府其覺醒。國人其覺醒。</p>

<p>仍事否認國聯判斷</p>
<p>一再强辯於事何補</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　日代表在此間發表日本對於國聯大會報告書之意見書、在結論中否認許多國聯之判斷、如稱日本在滿並未逾越自衛範圍、［滿洲國］係自然産生、日本未嘗違犯國聯盟約、九國公約、或凱洛格非戰公約、力稱日本在滿並無領土野心、第欲使滿洲成爲共産主義侵入遠東之障壁等、無非欺人之談、此外復一再誣衊中國之無組織、以期朦蔽世人、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日本政府提出國聯之陳述書要旨如下、</p>
<p>第一部、日本與國聯之協力、日本對於國聯之發逹與成功、與以協力十有餘年、中國要求國聯理事會審議中日問題、然日軍行動爲對於中軍攻擊之自衛行動也、國聯與日本見解之不同、因國聯缺乏對於遠東之理解而發生日本曾要求國聯遺派調查團、得諒解中國實狀、然委員會報告書不能作爲足以記述中國眞相之書、因此日本於去年十一月十八日提出意見書、然其後國勢組織、不得日本同意而組織之十九國委員會、其後依據盟約第十五條第二項起草關於和解之决議與理由書、而日本對於該决議要求削除不承認滿洲國二節、同時與國聯繼續交涉、並提出種種提案、以計發見妥協手段、然卒無効果、於期十九國委員會認第三項和解爲不可能、而起草第四項報告書、二月二十四日不顧日本反對、提交大會而通過矣、</p>
<p>第二部、報告之誤謬、報告書以李頓報告書爲其基礎、審議爭執事實、殊爲遺憾、報告書認中國九一八以後之抵制日貨爲報復手段、然事將來對於與中國有關係之各國必有影響、又報告書　九一八日本軍行動不得認爲自衛行動、日政府否認中國抵制日貨爲報復之决議、報告書又謂滿洲國之獨立、非由居民自動意志而發生、此採用　頓報告書誤謬之决論者也、</p>
<p>第三部、實行不可能之勸告、（一）適用盟約及巴黎條約原則於如中國之變態的事態時、應與以相當之伸縮性爲嚴必要、（二）報告書勸告日軍之撤退、然日軍駐紥並不與法律的原則相反、日軍根　於日滿議定書有維持［滿洲國］内治安之資任、（三）報告書雖稱滿洲主權屬於中國、然滿洲自一九一六年以後、未曾屬於中國權力、（四）省略、（五）設立交涉委員會之辦法、與日本不許任何第三者干涉滿洲問題之主張相反、故日本絕對不能接受如此提案、</p>
<p>第四部、結論、日本政府確信九一八以後日軍行動、均不出於自衛之範圍、又［滿洲國］由滿洲居民自動意志而成立之事、故日政府以爲其軍隊之行動、及日滿議定書之訂立、並不侵害國聯盟約、力國條約、巴黎條約、及其他任何國際條約、［滿洲國］現已推行迅速之發達、而外國人及滿洲居民、均受其利益、此則證明日本承認、滿洲國一爲轉持遽東和平唯一方法之具體事實也、（二十六日日聯電）</p>

<p>二週後徴求會員</p>
<p>明日舉行常理會</p>
<p>東北協會爲援敎東北碭　東北之續一團體、其目的爲援助在東北作戰之將士、調查東三省現在過去之實况、研究東北問題之解决、並聯合全國各團體、以合力協助發揮整個民族之毅力及决心、以謀東北問題之解决、當成立之初、發起人吳鐵城史量才等、已將其目的明白宣示、前日該會全體理事更聯名宣言、詳述創立之旨趣及所負之重任、以喚醒國人上下團結、作全民族之總動員、以貫澈其目的、中央社記者爲欲明瞭該會籌劃組織之現况、特往該會總幹事臧啓芳氏、當得其詳爲解答如次、</p>
<p>二件重要的工作</p>
<p>臧氏語記者、東北</p>
<p>協會成立之宗旨、在前日發表之宣言中、已經詳述、國人想已明瞭、現在我人所籌劃者、爲工作之計劃、其最重要者有二端、（一）爲如何使在東北之義勇軍能在統一領導之下、響應國軍同起奮戰、（二）爲調查東三省之近况及僞組織與日本之内　、以研究應付之策略、去歲馬占山馮占海丁超李杜等相繼出國後、東北義勇軍之氣燄、似已消沉、然在實際東北人民之枕戈待命者、尚不下二十萬之數、惟或因缺乏領導、或以給養斷絕、故匿跡深山、以待機會耳、且因日本軍人之嚴密偵查、國内消息之不能傳逹該處、故彼等雖已準備就緒、而尚未知殺敵効國之時機已經成熟也、現在熱邊大戰、已經爆發、故義軍之奮起響應、以攻其後、實爲良好之機會、如熱省國軍、能維持三月、則日本之慘敗、當在意料之中、即不幸熱省失陷、本會對義軍之後援、亦不稍减、蓋義軍在其内部作戰之效力、實較派兵收復失地爲宏大也、故本會一方固須與以領導及援助、一方更將種種消息傳遞該處、俾得應時而起、</p>
<p>二週後徴求會員</p>
<p>繼談及徴求會員事</p>
<p>、臧氏謂會務之籌</p>
<p>劃、大約再經二週、</p>
<p>即可就緒、故徴求會員期、亦不過遠、本會旣爲挽救東北解决東北問題之大集團、故希望全國同胞、均爲會員、吳市長曾謂東北問題、須深印全國同胞之腦中、隨時隨地加以警惕、即東北能收復後、亦勿忘東北建設之重大責任、但人壽有限、而東北問題、則恐非短時期間所能解决、故如有東北協會之存在、雖傳至吾子吾孫、亦必不忘東北也、至其組織、更須求普及全國、各地會員均成立分會、其内部組織、將視需要而增設若干特種委員會、上次理事會决定之外交委員會、已在着手進行中、將來對東北之國際問題、詳加調查及研究、以貢獻政府參考、其他如經濟委員會參謀委員會等、亦將次第成立、以研究各種專門問題、</p>
<p>明日舉行常理會</p>
<p>臧氏末謂、本會已</p>
<p>定於明日（星期一）</p>
<p>午後四時半、假市</p>
<p>政府召集第一次常務理事會、討論一切進行事宜、至於會址、原擬附設中國航空協會内、現因該會房屋不敷應用故、故已另行覓定、俟修葺後、即可遷入辦公云、</p>

<p>頑　比較的還　强健、所以活到今年六十九歲、一生没有什麽大病、我相借漢書上説的一有病不治、常得中醫、］簡直凡遇些小的傷風發熱時、從不曾請敎過醫一、我也相信有幾種藥物、有自小由外祖母等傳授的、如鬧肚子·吃些山查灰、喧嗽·吃雙貝母·蒸雪梨·之類、由新流行所暗示的、如打　疾·吞兩粒金　納霜丸·冒充吞陸·又服幾顆沙逹明脱之類、倒也往往樂到病除、所以也很不葬薄什麽黄耆黨參、什麽血清雷錠、不管什麽中醫西醫、止有五臟閣涉五行、敲了全副牙齒、可以做治病之準備等、還没有信仰的程度、然而説句腐敗話、幸虧天照料、旣不曾患過傷寒肺炎、亦不曾生過流注發背、所以也没有機會試騐醫生的本領、可是對於這種險症的預防、什麽新鮮的空氣哩、清潔的飲食哩、到必要時、我也相信選擇、不過看我像似漫不管的罷了、什麽肥鮮的鱗甲哩、什麽狼吞虎嚥的大魚大肉哩、我到胃口不對時、也知道停筷、不過看我像似不擇美惡罷了、我就是對於衛生常談、比較有理的、都能試行、不過没有了夫詳細研究罷了、但是我年輕時也吐過血、我看醫書上設、［吐血不死、駭必］死、我就掩了卷、從此我有了頓悟、於是馬上自已宜做已經死了、馬上飲食有節、起居有時、悠然自得、午後散步近郊、仰視白雪、舒展天際、豁人心胸、静坐而聽檐前雀噪、美如笙簧·哈哈、不到二十天、被我養得肥頭胖耳、滴血不吐、而且從此不發、我最好笑的、呌什麽斷根、凡希望斷根之人、有了病、手忙脚亂、趕請醫生、怨天恨地、托命醫生、（那託命菩薩的、自然更可笑了、）我終不大贊同、我有時還笑他們作死、所以看我雖是不信醫藥、而且是隨便過活的人、不料我每到小病終、能用我的忍耐留心、對付過去、例如牙藥、我便故意問什麽呌做痛、體念痛的程度、看他到如何地步、倒也止覺熱烘烘棗、無奈何了、有時膀子舉不起來、我以爲何必急急治好、落得聽便他休息休息、省點舉動、我相信用自然的療法、或者也很有帮助、然而到底還是我的野蠻、幸虧託賴身體比較頑健、不能算做經騐、有供人參考的價值、但是同我朋友丁仲祐先生相共了五十年、我們看他身體的怯弱、往往吃驚、嘴裏不好説、而心表憂愁、他决不是一個壽客、加之、他治學處事的努力、異乎常人、就是他研究醫術、治病的懇切、被他用藥物治好的身體怯弱之人、也就不少、那不是更消耗池的精神麽、何以他竟一點不走作、心想必定用藥自醫、故居然到了六十歲、身體到反强健起來、然聽見他不大輕易服藥、止是心平氣和、很少火胃、也很少急躁、我所以了解他眞懂得自然療法、常稱他爲聖賢養病法、舉告一切自已不懂自然療法專靠藥物者、呌他們學步、乃目前他把種種空氣日光飲食運動等自然療法、擇要的一一介紹出來、才知他原有這種本領、這些理解、在他雖得其精·在我亦略得其粗者深信我是任天的老健、他是自造的康壽、我讀了他的書、愈信我的道路、走得不錯、他的明燈、導引了我、我更能走得得法、故爾在民衆新醫學叢書二十種出版之際、敢把對了醫藥一點不懂的我、也在書首加些瞎話、以備和我一樣頑健的人、及和丁先生同一怯弱的人、都來參證、可是我雖篤信疾病是要自然療法來帮助、然而如犯了流行病、時疫症等、非用藥物預防、或請醫生治療的、我也並信到昭種情形、决不能專恃自然療法的、幸虧丁先生此書、也已經有更詳備的簡要藥物預防法、或勸告如何醫治法、給我們了、這眞是人人應當懷一本的要書呀、丁先生自已得了壽先八百的秘訣、希望别人個個壽長八百、我們又應當感謝他、好了、廢話也太説多了、傳丁先生一笑罷、民國二十二年二月、吳敬恒、</p>

<p>做工和戀愛</p>
<p>丨丨復韋影君來信丨丨</p>
<p>答：來信讀悉，略復如左：（一）學徒問題。你對於學徒的觀念有很多矛盾：第一，你説：你［感到做學徒，除給］師父打駡，皮肉損失之外，精神是極端快樂的。］這話恐怕是一種客氣，不是由衷之言因爲你［第忖做工終］非長計］，這不是矛盾麽？第二，一個人被人打，被人駡，精神上還是極端的快樂，恐怕没有這回事，你究竟快樂什麽呢？這不是矛盾嗎？第三，旣説願意做學徒，又天天希望升到職員，這不是矛盾嗎？第四，你説：［泥灰臉，油漬衣……中國人生之典型］，其實這並不能算是中國人生之典型。世界先進國的工人莫不如此，僅靠着你泥灰臉，油漬衣，便［可以與列强並駕齊驅］？這話説得也是不明不白。如果説，中國的前途是要靠着泥灰臉，油漬衣，這般人羣起來肩負，這是對的，然而這種肩負的目的並不在［與列强並駕齊驅］，恰恰相反，突在是要打倒這種並駕齊驅的社會因素，因爲並駕齊驅就是互爭雄長，就是爭霸稱雄，就是帝國主義爭奪和壓榨殖民地的罪惡表現，你旣然願做工人，而又在那做帝國主義的迷夢，這不是矛盾麽？（二）婚姻問題。你旣和你的從前店主人的女兒發生戀愛，自然要發生問題：第一，你是學徒，他是店主人：第二，他有錢，你是窮小子，這不但是普通的地位問題。而是很嚴重的貧富問題。横在你面前的急切要解决的問題是這樣：是你爬到他那一地位去高攀他呢？還是他死心塌地，掃棄一切降到你這一地位，情願同廿共苦來俯就你呢？果然他來俯就你，那是値得我們贊揚的，如果你要爲着追逐你的愛人而放棄了你所生活的學徒社會，工人社會，那你這人也就有限了，今日之事，在我們想來，只有這樣：（一）你死心塌地地做你的學徒，進而做一個獨立生活的工人，你要爲你們［泥灰臉，油漬衣］的社會羣衆謀共的福利。如果［這山望］着那山高］，鎭日價要想升職員，做老板，那你是不對的。（二）光明磊落地寫信給你的老板小姐，明白地告訴他説，我現在做了學徒了，將來的生活只是一個工人的生活。假使他願意和你始終相愛，那只有舍却店東小姐的身分來和你這灰鼻灰臉的哥兒共同生活，不然的話，那就和他一刀兩斷，各走各的人生之路。泥灰臉，油漬衣的社會中，儘可找到泥灰臉，油漬衣的愛人，這種愛人門戶相當，地位一樣，利害相同，自然可以得到魚水和諧之樂。若是你疾心不死，定要［癩蝦　想吃天鵝肉］，那便是自討苦吃。雖然你拚死命飛上天去吃到了天鵝肉，一交跌下，不死也弄得腿斷骨折，葬送了你的一生！忠言逆耳，明知區區之意不能見納於足下，然而除此以外，我們實别無良策可供採擇，幸足下三思之。</p>

<p>小話者、所以别於呼彥之閒話也。其實，小話也就是閒話。因恐有人誤會我或有影射［文字典型］的野心，所以還是［小話］來得妥當一些。</p>
<p>據熟於風土人情的老上海説，中装穿到［獺皮大衣］，西装穿到［塔克西多］，不作興再坐人力車。這當然爲體面與身分的關係。</p>
<p>所以，不穿獺皮大衣而坐人力車，顯然有些秋氣，而以在南京路上爲尤甚。因爲人力車在那條海上之菁華的路上，照例是不得上電車軌道，而祗能緊挨着人行道走的。</p>
<p>要是分起品級來，人力車儻算是三等車，那匯票掮客的塔克西Ｔaxl，恐怕只好打入［未入流］吧。它旣不敢步武汽車電車而馳騁夫康莊大道，又不耐煩跟着人步化的人力車慢慢見行。吆吆喝喝，老給車夫們一種精神上的擾亂和威脅。可惜我不能代表車夫，有時我眞想回過頭去；　［你要緊？有本事跑當中去！］</p>
<p>爲免除電車上的擁擠，在早晨我居然特訂了包月車，（那當然不能説是布爾喬亞）每逢馬嘴子上熱烘烘的白沫，飛濺到我衣領上時，我似乎聞到一陣又腥又腐的惡氣。而忍不住咒詛。同時，使我十分惓念故鄉的漿劃船。它雖然頂小；但是它可以優游自得在河當中行，不必受水上警察的干涉。至於　在船艙裏聽烏篷上淅淅瀝瀝的雨聲的那一種時意，更非悶在籠一樣的車篷裏的上海人所能夢見了！</p>

<p>路見不平，拔刀相助，假使這二句　話，還没有成爲［中國文化博物］院］中的骨董之一，祇足以供今人的鑑賞與贊歟的話，那麽，逹兩文的弱肉强食論，也夠不上請秦始皇焚，祇好同破銅爛鐵放在一起，論斤兒的當廢物賣。　不信，請瞧事實。</p>
<p>流氓，丨北方人所説的青皮，調戲上街的良家婦女那回事，讀者諸君，除了一世没出過大門的，在這烏烟瘴氣的社會裏，大抵總睄見過一二遭吧。那麽，現在就抓這回事打比。</p>
<p>好好兒的一位女太太在街上獨個兒走，給一個青皮一眼睄上了，儘跟在後面瞎三話四，甚而至於毛手毛脚的調戲。假使這位女太太是個嫩貨兒，儘着青皮調戲，三步并作二步，紅着臉，低着頭的避，那麽，非但青皮得其所哉，就是看熱鬧的好好先生，也會伸頭伸頸地呌好。假使這位女太太不是好惹的，青皮放了一個屁，早已一把領口，二下巴掌，那麽，馬上有人來做好做歹的調解，或許警察也會把青皮抓去法辦的。</p>
<p>日本把中國欺侮得也夠了。奪去東三省，中國祇是不抵抗，活現地是一位罕曾見的可喜娘，儘着青皮調戲，誰見有一位拔刀相助的路見不平者？十九路軍和第五軍在淞滬抵抗，正如女太太的柳眉倒豎，杏眼圓睜，您瞧，各國的公使領事，就手忙脚亂地來調解了。熱河已挖好了壕溝，準備同敵軍拼個你死我活，國聯的病狀，日有進步，比前硬朗得多了。</p>
<p>現在這世界，惟有自强，纔不受人欺侮。假使自已是阿斗，滿望着人來路見不平，拔刀相助，哼，休想。</p>

<p>丨中國的女子們請照一照自已丨</p>
<p>（一）松岡的母親</p>
<p>好多天前，報載：［松岡離國赴日内瓦時，其老母曾親贈日本刀一把，囑其爲國奮鬥，謂倘在國聯上外交失敗，可將該刀自裁，以顯揚大和民族之精神。］松岡拿了刀，跑到日内瓦，親見日本外交，已成僵局，松岡每次回歸寓所，常視其母所贈之刀而嘆氣。　　這把刀，的確有價値。旣悲壯，又熱烈，尤其是我們怕死的中國人，應該仿效。</p>
<p>在中國，生了一個小孩子，都當爲是自家的一注財産，一株摇錢樹，只要這個小孩子長大了。能夠拍馬，吹牛，貪污，會弄錢，父母們必定笑逐顏開，不論社會是怎樣？國家是如何？　　這位松岡的母親，把自已的兒子生死，看得很輕，而以國家，民族爲重，在偌大的中國，恐怕踏破鐵鞋也找不到半個。</p>
<p>假使中國的做母親的，都給伊的子女每人一把鋒鋭的中國刀，並且囑咐道：［你不把你的仇人殺死，奇恥雪掉，失］地收復，那末，你就拿刀自裁，永遠不要再回家。］</p>
<p>能夠如此，中國，準保不會亡！</p>
<p>（二）律子夫人</p>
<p>在現在，尤其是畸形社會的中國，女人，要想找一個的確賢慧而能帮助丈夫學業成功的女人，眞是［鳳毛麟角。］　　不料，在三島日本！居然有一個鶴立鷄羣的律子夫人。</p>
<p>律子夫人，因爲伊的丈夫，在京都帝大擔任經濟學助敎，終天埋頭研究，不事生産，秘密練習開汽車，領得車夫執照，日間做汽車夫謀利，夜間操持家務使丈夫得心學問，這是一件難能的事。</p>
<p>大學敎授的太太，是何等的尊嚴？何等的快樂，汽車夫是如何的卑賤？如何的痛苦？然而在這位賢夫人律子看來，什麽都不尊嚴，什麽都不快樂，唯有丈夫的學業成功，才是極尊嚴極快樂的事　唉！茫茫中國，從那兒找律子夫人第二？</p>

<p>— 妙神</p>
<p>我國文字，一向以玉喻女人。如言［玉人］，卽指美麗的女人；如言（玉貌），卽指女的美貌。可見玉字的意思，不但是喻女人，而且是喻美麗的女人。而女子呢，非但以玉自居，一切［玉膚］［玉腕］［玉股］［玉腿］，都攬在自已身上，女人身上的一切無往而不玉。並且與玉爲友，認玉爲至寳，把玉佩在身上，戴在頭上，玉而有知，倒可稱𧰟福無窮！如果玉没有女的需要，恐怕今日它的價値，和磚石札去無幾。所以玉無女人，無此珍貴；女人無玉，不見美麗！因此後人有位荒唐子定義説：玉是女人，女人是玉</p>
<p>從字典中我們可以查到古寫的［玩］字，寫作［妧］。有人問：還什麽從［妧］字改爲［玩］字呢？這也有意思的：因爲我國從前女權雖不發逹，但崇女之心，倒並不在現代人之下，他們的理由是：女人那可給你玩呢？要玩還是玩玉去！因此把個女旁的，妧］，改爲斜玉旁的［玩］。可歎一般人不明這位造字先生的　意，仍把玉比女人，什麽美玉咧，美女咧，纏個不清，這未免太辜負改造［玩］字的一香苦心了。</p>

<p>好［好！張四哥！］田莊主身上每一根的血管。都在不住的澎漲着，差不多要爆裂了。［現在就請你引我們家的老六，］</p>
<p>老七兩人出去，通知合村住戶，吩咐他們趕快各自逃難；如其有人願意留在這裏，和倭子們决一死戰的，便請他們搬進莊來，伏在林子裏守着。不願者不必勉强！</p>
<p>三個人旋風似的走了。</p>
<p>［仔細！準備着！］田莊主横着刀，讓他的老夥伴把他䭾出莊去的時候，他瞧見林子裏已伏着一羣精神抖擻的少年人，摩拳擦掌地在那裏防守着。這都是幾年來他所訓練就的［田家兵］。</p>
<p>莊主吩咐大家各自逃難的消息傳佈出去之後，全村的人都知道他們的生命是危險了：情形頓時大亂，男的，女的，老的，少的，誰不想逃命？人像潮水一般的儘望西流去，哭聲，喊聲，遥遥地和前方的厮殺之聲相應；雞和犬也滿街的亂飛亂撞。　　願意留在這裏的一共是十四個人，其中有一個女人，還有一個是病人。</p>
<p>病人就是趙二哥。他在打發妻子們逃出村去之後，便柱着一支拐杖，一步一步的挨進莊來。</p>
<p>［趙二哥！你留在這裏幹什麽？還不凑早逃走啊？］旁邊的人這樣欵問着。</p>
<p>［我雖不能上陣，給你們料理飯食，也好盡盡我的心！］雄壯的笑在趙二哥的金黄色的臉上浮動着。［原來燒飯的人，也可以］替出去打仗了！］</p>
<p>［二哥的話不錯！］每一個人都給他感動了。</p>
<p>［姑母！你爲什麽不走啊？］小鈴向那一個女人很誠懇地問着。女人是田莊主的女兒，已經是寡婦了。</p>
<p>［什麽話！田莊主的女兒怎肯跟着人家逃命！］姑母像不知道外面有倭子殺來一般的鎭定地走進屋子裏去了，脚步還是跟平常一樣的從容和緩。</p>
<p>趙二哥和姑母的激勵，使每個人都增加出十倍的勇氣，分外有勁地握住了他們的兵器，静待着血鬥時期的來到。　　村上的人是走盡了，前綫的勝敗却還没有消息。　［小鈴！你聽喊聲怎麽漸漸近了？］説話的是小禾。！小鈴的從兄弟。</p>

<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>讀本年二月十五日申報，航空協會組織徴求隊二百隊，其目的將募會費二百萬元，而購置飛機之費，則就吳市長答復中華婦女節制會函，每架約在十萬以上十五萬以下，而就林我將先生所述日本現有飛機一千五六百架，我最少亦須有一千架以上，然則購機之費，須有二萬萬元方可，協會所募，不過百分之一之會費而已，然吾以爲救國之心，人人皆具，假令四萬萬人，每人擔任半元，則雖赤貧之心丐，每日乞得铜銅元一枚，亦不過數月工夫，已克盡其匹夫之責。至於無能力者，卽如襁褓之兒，亦必有人負其連帶之責，可無慮其不能擔任。例如八口之家，爲之主者，卽當担任四元，爲其應盡之義務，而能力較充者，雖數倍之，出於良心上之自願，亦不致於爲難，雖其繳欵之處，收欵之法，最好卽由政府仿照郵票式樣，立卽印刷航空儲劵一批，分爲半元五元五十元二種，分發各地郵局，與售賣郵票方法一般，得在任何郵局或郵信櫃，繳人航空救國儲金，掣給此劵一如所繳銀數，以資查考。一面卽托郵差爲義務徴求員，得携此劵，於送信時帶便勸募，逐日繳局，則凡足跡所經，定多成績，易收速效。凡已盡此義務者，得以此劵粘貼門首或易見之處，表示其愛國之心，自足引起光榮之觀念。蓋自一二八週年紀念後，民衆已無不知航空救國爲必要，但有許多觀念，亦爲民衆所不免，或則以爲此類救國捐之發起，已非一次，而結果圓滿者，殊不多　，遂抱冷觀，或則以爲此等捐欵，究不知應送何處。是否可成事實？因而觀望不前。又或自慚棉力，無補艱巨，聚塔之沙，而反認爲無足輕重，又或以爲勸募者不一而足，屢登其門，多多益善，殊無標準之可言，因而引起誤會嫌疑者，亦頗有之。凡此種種，若來鄙見，宜可解除，蓋使民衆皆知所應負擔之數，每人不過半元，自量其力，願代十人百人千人萬人，盡此義務者，亦必不在少數，而在未盡一分子義務者，亦必無躬自愧，問心不過，無論如何，必求盡其應盡之義務而後已。雖其父母已爲子女盡其兼責，而爲子女者，自願節省糖果玩具之費，以購救國儲劵，表示自已能力者，亦必不在少數。吾料郵局之門，必如山陰道上一般，按旬彙解，其數必有可觀。假如一月之間，揭報於衆，謂已購定飛機百架，則奮起之人，必多踴躍，有餘力者，亦且自告奮勇，繼起爲第二次之捐輸，可無待乎勸募。如果有人竟以此劵粘貼於臂上黑紗，以誌九一八之哀悼者，吾料引起觀念，當尤勝於逢人演講，蓋凡奮興作用，皆如是也。至於航空郵信，亦即因而可資利用，蓋防空之具，亦正如養兵千日用在一時，古者寓兵於農，今奚不可寓防空戰士於郵政之中，耶？甚望我政府采及芻蕘，毅然行之！</p>

<p>上海市十年來醫藥鳥瞰（續）</p>
<p>龐京周</p>
<p>除了上述的公私立醫院以外，還有一種診所而稱醫院，却並不能收容病人的，最易引起社會上的誤會，而予一般雜醫以貿利欺人的機會。我這里也順便申説一下：！！查醫院的組織，不是我國本來固有［醫院］二字的名稱，不過君主時代太醫院（御醫的彙粹處）用過，自從拿牠與西文Ｈospieal對譯之後，在人們腦筋裏，狹義的解説，似乎是一個收容病人，養疴受治的所在。然而政府官廳，却並没有明令規定醫院的資格，也没有説這名稱無可假借，語所謂名不正言不順，於是乎糾紛來了。</p>
<p>有許多醫者，在他個人的診所外面，掛上一個醫院的市招，或稱某某人醫院，或則另取安康博濟等等字樣，而其實他那裏何嘗能容納一個住院病人？尤其是一般雜醫，借重［醫院比個人聲價較大］的觀念，大夥兒掛起醫院牌子來，於是四馬路中，玻璃窗上，充滿了醫院的字樣，新聞紙後，廣告欄裏，編布了醫院的名稱，而最可笑的，拿别處久有聲名，借爲號召的工具。譬如北平有一個占地百畝的協和醫院，上海居然也有二開間的協和醫院：杭州有個依山傍水的廣濟醫院，上海也有個弄口路角的廣濟醫院：蘇州有個風景幽静的福音醫院：上海也有個電炬燦爛的福音醫院；非但中國文字寫得明明白白，還要加上西文的横額，牆上還要標明此科目價錢，以便問津者一目了然，眞正貽笑外邦，極社會之奇觀。然而我們新醫界中，以診所稱醫院的，也有個依據，！案日本的習慣；凡是醫家個人開業的地方，呌作醫院；！容納住院病人的地方，呌作病院，所以虹口一帶，什麽［清水］［篠崎］等醫院，就不定收住院病人，而福民醫院之不稱病院，已經遷就了中國的習慣了。在這排日潮流之中，我要奉勸諸位同道，不必以日本的習慣爲依據，而再以診所稱醫院，以致於攪亂我們已經［約定俗成之名］。</p>
<p>但是社會上人，因爲被醫界這麽一混亂，反而把從前對於醫院的認識變易了。我常受到酬酢間的詢問，並且聽見别個醫師，也受着同樣詢問，！説：［久仰久仰！大醫師醫院在那裏］？好似醫師必有醫院，有醫院的，方是大醫師，所以我主張，在最近的將來，須由衛生局醫師公會等會同了租界當局，將上海市的公私立醫院調查表，註明主任醫師，診治科目，床位多少，等次如何？收費若干？在報紙上大規模的披露一下，倒可以分析社會上的觀聽不少，而便利於病家適從，也不在小處呢。</p>

<p>（十）分娩日期預算法</p>
<p>從最終月經之第一日算起，以迄二百八十天之日，即爲預算之分娩日期，　　算法　加七日於末次月經之第一日，加九個月於其月數，或由此減去三個月，即　預算之分娩日期：</p>
<p>（一）假定末次月經之第一日是九月二十一日：</p>
<p>日日　日</p>
<p>一　七八</p>
<p>算廿　加　廿即六月廿八日</p>
<p>式月月　月　爲預測分娩日</p>
<p>九三六</p>
<p>减</p>
<p>（二）假定末次月經之第一日是一月五日：</p>
<p>日　日　日</p>
<p>五　七　二</p>
<p>算　加　十即十月十二日</p>
<p>式　月　月　月爲預測分娩日</p>
<p>一　九　十</p>
<p>加</p>
<p>此種算法，簡潔明瞭，人人易算，</p>
<p>尚有一種預算表，亦頗簡明，列表如下：</p>
<p>上表根據最後一次　月經的出現日子，按照　表内應加字數，一加即　得。</p>
<p>例如最後月經之日，是一月二十日，那末；預測的産期，就是十月二十七日。最後月經之日是十二月一日，那末，預測次年的九月七日分娩，餘可類推。</p>
<p>（十一）分娩（臨盆）</p>
<p>分娩就是妊婦娩出胎兒及其附屬物，俗稱臨盆，通常二百八十天算　正當分娩期，在這分娩時期，有一種娩出力，使胎兒自然娩出，並使子宮收縮，又名産出力，即陣痛，腹壓，陰　壁，骨盆底部，圓軔帶，及喇叭管肌肉等，均起收縮之總稱。</p>
<p>（甲）陣痛</p>
<p>陣痛就是分娩的時候，子宮反覆而起定期性的收縮，因之疾痛，所以就有陣痛的名稱。</p>
<p>陣痛乃是開始分娩，而加以促進分娩的步驟，能使妊卵剝離，妊卵排出，因其作用，以便娩出。</p>
<p>前驅陣痛，乃在相近妊娠末期之時，常起微弱的子宮收縮，是謂前驅陣痛，初産婦（就是初次生産的産婦）在前驅陣痛時，屢有緊張的感覺，或輕徹的疾痛，但是經産婦，在第二胎以上的産婦）多無疾痛的感覺，在前驅陣痛，起初不過一二次及至分娩時期愈迫，那末：陣痛次數，亦愈增加，但發作與間歇，大都不甚匀整，其收縮力亦甚微弱，假使陣痛增劇，往往誤認作分婏的開始，其中不可不細心辨别。</p>
<p>（乙）分娩第一期……開口期</p>
<p>分娩第一期開始陣痛，是謂開口期陣痛，以反覆整匀爲始，直迄子宮口完全開放，其時子宮逐漸收縮，陣痛逐漸强劇，陣痛發作之持續時間，在三十秒至五十秒，或許較長，其間歇時間，爲十分至一刻鐘或許二分至五分鐘，由此陣痛加緊，子宮口亦漸張大，卵膜亦因此與子宮剝離，在剝離面常有出血，所以排出時，每有血液混合的粘膜，這就是子宮口開大之徴象。</p>
<p>（一）子宮口如何能夠開大……上述剝離的卵膜，隆突如胞狀，進入子宮口内，因此子宮口徐徐開大，這就是胎胞，胞内儲有羊水（胞水）胎胞在陣痛時緊張，間歇時弛緩，每逢陣痛一次，那末；胎胞的大小及緊張的度數，亦必增加一次，并由上方壓開子宮口，子宮口旣開大，那邊緣就向上而縮，初産婦在此時，她的兒頭，就嵌入骨盆内，經産婦的兒頭，有時尚在骨盆入口移動，但在陣痛時，亦均固定在骨盆入口。</p>
<p>（二）破胞時有響聲……在此時期，陣痛反覆增劇，産婦頓呈恐怖狀態，食慾减少，或竟不食，惡寒怕冷，時有惡心嘔吐等狀，子宮口愈開大，陣痛愈劇烈，胎胞異常緊張，陣痛在間歇時，亦不再弛懈，一切緊張，達於極度，在此當兒，胎膜突然破裂，同時：并射出前胞水（羊水），這就破胞，破胞時胞水約重三十公分，並有響聲。</p>
<p>（三）假羊水……假羊水俗名濾胞生，往往在脱落膜和脈絡膜之間所蓄的液質流出，誤以爲前羊水的，或是破在上方，那末；胞水泄漏，但是胞膜末破。</p>
<p>（四）破胞的遲早……在前驅陣痛時，即已破裂，是名前期破水，倘子宮尚未開達五　時，胎兒先進部亦未進至骨盆入口，而胞水已經破裂，這是早期皮水。　　（五）早期破水的危險……破水以後的子宮開張，全賴胎兒的先進部有以促進，所以經過非常的徐緩，并且羊水泄漏不止，倘若早期破水，那末，胎兒密接於子宮壁，亦有因此陷於危險的境界。</p>
<p>（六）遲延破水……子宮口已十分開大，胎胞不破，乃因陣痛反覆漸降，以致膨脹於陰門之外，胎盤被其牽引，因此一部分之被剥離而出血，妨礙胎兒的血液循環，或者胎兒完全被卵膜所包裹而娩出，若不將卵膜翦破，那末；胎兒勢必陷於窒息而亡。</p>
<p>（七）破水以後……陣痛或常休息片刻，後再强烈地發作，那時兒頭更加深入骨盆腔，前進移行到第二期的分娩去。</p>
<p>痰説三</p>
<p>余雲岫</p>
<p>痰病證候之説，至金元以後，蕪穢怪誕極矣，不暇繁引，錄其最著者以見梗概。</p>
<p>陳無擇三因方曰：［爲喘，爲欬，］爲嘔，爲泄，爲眩暈，嘈煩，忪悸，愪濩，寒熱，疼痛，腫滿，蠻癖，癃閉，痞隔，如風，如癲，未有不由痰飲所致］。</p>
<p>王隱君曰：［或頭風眩暈，目運耳］鳴，或口眼蠕動，眉稜耳輪俱癢或痛，或四肢游風腫硬，而似疼非疼，或爲齒頰癢痛，牙齒浮而痛癢不一，或噫氣吞酸，心下嘈雜，或痛或噦，或咽嗌不利，咯之不出，嚥之不下，其痰似墨，有如破絮桃膠蜆肉之狀，或心下如停冰鐵，心頭冷痛，或夢寐奇怪之狀，惑足腕酸軟，腰背骨節卒痛，或四肢筋骨疼痛難名，並無當所，乃至手麻臂痛，狀若風濕，或脊上每有一條如綫之寒起者，</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>或渾身習習，如臥芒剌者，或眼粘濕癢，口糜舌爛喉痺等證，或遶項結核，狀若瘰癢，或胸腹間有如二氣交紐，噎塞煩悶，有如烟火上衝，頭面烘熱，或爲失志顚狂，或中風癱瘓，或癆瘵荏苒之疾，或風毒脚氣，或心下怔忡，如長人捕，或喘嗽嘔吐，或嘔冷涎綠水黑汁，甚爲肺癰腸毒，便　攀跛，蓋内外爲病，百般皆痰所致，其狀不同，難以盡述，蓋津液旣凝爲痰，不復同潤三焦，故口燥烟乾，大便秘，面如枯骨，毛髮焦槁，婦人則因此月水不通］，此論痰病證候之最複雜者，（徐春甫古今醫統及）孫東宿赤水元球引王隱君，論證更繁，茲從劉宗厚玉機微義及沈朗仲病機彙論所節引，）也。</p>
<p>金匱言痰飲之候，已有溢出胃腸病之外者，如手足痺四肢歷節痛之類，是也，其面翕然熱如醉狀之類是也，此皆兼證，而皆歸之痰飲，已不可訓，至王隱君則舉一切内外科病神經病精神病，皆歸罪於痰，以擴大其礯石滖痰丸之功用，謬妄極矣，劉宗厚乃引脈經及活人書之言，以明隱君之非誣，後之言痰者，遂若皆在天羅地網之中，而不能自脱矣。</p>
<p>至於言痰之原因，張子和分風痰熱痰濕痰酒痰食痰爲五，陳無擇以七情爲内因，六淫爲外因，飲食色慾運動爲不内外因，丹溪則有因熱因氣因驚因續飲多食因暑因傷冷物因脾虚因嗜酒之别，又有濕痰老痰鬱痰頑痰等目，由痰病證候之説，則無病而非痰之崇，由痰病原因之説，則無因不可生痰後世劉松峰言疫，遂至無病而非疫，郭右陶言痧，遂至無病而非痧，皆襲金元痰説之故智也。</p>
<p>若夫成痰之原因，漢唐人祗謂由水飲聚　而成，宋人則以爲由津液凝濁而生，其説蓋始於龐安常，又以爲由涎結而爲飲，其説則見於陳無擇，嗣是以後，言痰，遂完全以粘稠涎沫及濃厚濁唾當之，不復以水飲爲痰矣，更可異者，以膠固粘稠者爲痰，清而稀薄者爲飲，此乃後人之所共云，而陳無擇乃有［涎結爲飲］之語，夫飲由涎結，則飲稠於涎，與痰無異，是并古人之水飲，而亦以爲粘稠之痰矣。</p>
<p>要而言之，金匱痰飲，祗言胃腸之水，後人旣認粘稠之涎沫及濃厚之濁唾爲痰，則所見病候，自與金匱不同，而於金匱所言水飲之證狀，又不敢削除删改，於是兼容並蓄，合以肺管之唾，而痰飲之論，始混淆不清，値金元空想玄論熾昌之會，於是議論漫無崖岸，又取粘膜炎之分泌粘液者，亦歸入之，如痢是也，又取諸神經之急劇障礙，氣管分泌因而增加者，亦歸入之，如中風，如小兒驚風，如癲癎如酒家晨嘔是也，推而廣之，又取與水與粘液絕無關係之病，亦羅而致之，如臂不能動，手麻，及腦後風聲耳内蟬鳴，心下怔忡如畏人捕等神經證狀是，是以痰病之説，乃蕪穢誕怪而莫可究詰矣。</p>

<p>（二）在今日的中國，自由職業者像律師會計師都是一式的，提到醫師就不同了！最顯著的有新醫舊醫二派，此中的爭執不屬於本題範圍，現再捨開不談。在新醫内又有正式開業醫師和非正式的之别。此種非正式醫生，並非出身殹校，大多數係做過醫院看護或醫師私人助手。其中也有學識稍差而醫術經騐都不壞的，此種大多數是敎會醫院出身，（在從前中國尚没有正式醫校的時候）但佔其中之少數。大多數則均不知所云，視醫藥基本科學解剖生理化學生物等若無睹的。他們均知道内科外科與生理解剖關係最深，不能强作解人；祗有花柳病祗統會注射六○六，就可做花柳病專家醫生。老實説一句，他們認爲醫並非種種科學，是一種術法。所以無論是醫師的號房，或車夫，祇須看見醫師注射過幾次六○六，讀一篇六○六注射法，就可以懸牌做專家醫生。其中手腕長一點，得要人的保託，也可以領到醫師開業執照。就是領不到，好在上海租界是化外地，又是花柳病發生最多的地方；所以花柳專家頭銜也就特别的多。他們使醫師這職業完全商業化，想盡種種法子來競爭。什麽包醫淋濁呀，二針斷根呀，一圓注射六○六呀。其實是合四五人分開注射一瓶溶液，或是注射他病人的剩餘溶液，俗稱六○六大屁股。前者不過是分量减輕無效果，後者則流弊甚大。到了碰着有錢的主顧，他們也會説注射特别上等的六○六每以二三十元不等這一類的話。偏偏梅毒病者，總有些怕難爲情，最慮熟識的醫師説出來，和他的名譽有碍。所以大部也找這類醫生去診治。其結果弄得醫界漆黑一團烏烟瘴氣是非顚倒黑白不分。而病者并没有沾着根本治愈的利益。此種現象，開業醫師因各人有各人特殊的地位和苦衷，决不能効法此輩，并且奬導欺騙，尤不足爲馴。但假是有免費可長期診治，則此輩亦難施狡獪。　　（三）有了梅毒免費治療所，貧苦病人患此症而無力尋醫師診治固可以受根本治愈之惠。即有錢自醫而不願免費治療，也可以慢慢曉得梅毒根本治療并非如此簡單，而正當醫師也不致迫被欺騙之嫌疑了。病家一有正當認識，那本病完全治愈的希望也比較現在爲大。</p>
<p>以上所寫的幾種理由，係作者一時隨便舉出的；我想應補充的地方一定很多，統望同道中加以留意。</p>

<p>疾病常識問答</p>
<p>（續）程瀚章</p>
<p>（三）麻疹（俗稱痧子或瘄子）</p>
<p>間麻疹是什麽病·西文名呌什麽？答麻疹就是俗稱的瘄子·也呌痧子，英文名Ｍeeasies，德文名Masern，拉丁文是Ｍorbilli</p>
<p>問麻疹的病原是什麽？</p>
<p>答　現在還没有發見，大概是一種超顯微鏡的么微體。</p>
<p>問這種病原物，存在於什麽地方？答存在於病人的血液，涙液，痰涕，唾液，和皮膚的落屑中。</p>
<p>問這種病最容易傅染的是那一種人？答小兒最容易傅染。</p>
<p>問怎樣傅染的？</p>
<p>答由於和病人同居，接近或吸入空氣中浮游的病原體而傅染的。</p>
<p>問爲什麽小兒最容易患麻疹？</p>
<p>答因爲人類對於麻疹都有感受性的；而一次患了麻疹以後，都能終生免疫。所以在小兒時代，差不多没有不傅染的，而年齡大的，大都已經患過，所以不再受傳染了。</p>
<p>問這種病，在什麽季節流行最多？答在春季往往起一時的流行。</p>
<p>問　麻疹病毒傅染之後，經過幾天發病？</p>
<p>答經過約十天的潛伏期纔發病。問在發病期中，可以分做幾期？答可以分前驅期發疹期和恢復期三期。</p>
<p>問前驅期的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答病者的顏面稍呈浮腫，結合膜，鼻腔，咽，喉，支氣管等部現出炎衝症狀。起羞明，流涙，噴嚔，衂血，嗄聲，咳嗽等。這樣情形，大概三四天，於是顯出黏膜疹和哥伯力氏斑點。這是麻疹所特有的症狀。</p>
<p>問什麽呌做哥伯力氏斑點？</p>
<p>答哥伯力氏斑點（Ｋopliklsspots）是在臼齒對面的口類黏膜上　生的白斑，大小像留針頭，周圍有紅暈的。</p>
<p>問這時期中的體温怎樣？</p>
<p>答體温在起初幾天，以戰慄或惡寒而上昇，不久就很降下，到第三天起再上昇像階梯狀。</p>
<p>問發疹期的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答身體發疹的時候，體温更見上昇，現稽留熱或弛張熱型；到了發疹的全期，渙散狀退熱。</p>
<p>問身體上發疹的情形怎麽樣？答皮膚疹，先現於顏面，頭部，耳郭等處，繼及頸部，軀幹，四肢。疹子，最初是和毛蠧相一致的留針頭大小的充血性斑點；後來漸漸擴大融合，稍隆起於皮膚面，成爲帶淡紅色至暗赤色的丘疹。到發疹期的第三天，發疹最盛。而黏膜疹到了皮膚發疹顯著的時候，反而消退。哥伯力氏斑也不明瞭問恢復期是怎樣的？</p>
<p>答恢復期的時候，體温正常，皮膚疹隨着現出時的順序而漸漸退色，起糠粃狀落屑，於是各種症狀消失。問恢復期中有起别種病變嗎？</p>
<p>答有的。大多數起支氣管炎，甚至肺炎，那是很劇重的。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c153">洋釐固定後之瞻顧 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 潘士浩</p>
<p>上海錢，公議，自三月一日起，固定洋厘爲七錢一五，銀元銀兩間之比價，永久一定，舉凡一切通貨之行市，如小洋等，從此均以銀元爲表示市價之標準，一切帳篷之計算，均以銀元爲單位，蓋銀元已取銀兩固有之地位而代之矣。今距實行之期，祗有二日。（三月一日）回溯旣往，購念將來，不能無言。</p>
<p>夫我國本無所謂洋厘也。自一四九七年墨西哥盛　銀元，流通之廣，自北美各州面及菲律　及我國各口岸。於是寗波，厦門，上海等處，於本有之銀兩外，復有英洋爲記賬計算之單位。（以其幣面有鷹，俗稱匯洋通作英洋）以二者比價之上落，而洋厘生焉。當是時，鷹洋之勢力，不及銀兩。一般人目以銀兩爲國寳，而以鷹洋爲洋元。凡官商之記帳計算，均以銀兩爲主幣。故二者間之比價，亦以洋厘表示之。換言之。卽銀兩爲主幣，而　洋爲雜幣也，此爲洋厘。起源時期。</p>
<p>清光緒十三年，粤督張之洞氏奏准開請本國銀元，以抵制外國銀元。兩廣·兩湖·湖南·直隸·安徽·浙江·奉天·吉林·福建·雲南·山東·河南等省，紛紛開鑄，計銀元局凡十有七處，以其幣面均鑄有龍救，俗統稱龍洋。型式旣大同小異，成色亦未能一律，授受之間，動生歧視。於是銀元之種類愈多，洋厘之市價亦愈雜。以上海言。　洋旣另有洋厘，而龍洋中如江南·湖北·廣東·奉天等等，又各有洋厘。其未開行市者，或比附而授受，或貼水以使用，紛亂龐雜，絕盡［雜貨幣制度］下之惡現象。故銀元之流通數量雖日增，銀兩之實際授受雖漸减，而銀元仍不脱其雜幣資格，銀兩確能維持其主席之資格焉，此爲洋厘之雜亂時期　　民國三年，天津造幣總廠根據國幣條例，開鑄袁像新幣，江南造幣廠繼之，型式成色頗能一律，流通之數漸增，舊式銀元，紛紛收回改鑄，市上通貨之雜亂狀態漸减。四月八月，上海中交二銀行與錢業公所協商，洋厘除英洋新幣，江南·湖北·廣東·大清銀幣等，仍舊分别開做外。其他各種龍洋，均得向一銀行掉換新幣，不復另開行市，駸漸而各埠　之，洋厘乃漸見統一。此爲雜種洋厘漸歸消滅時期。</p>
<p>自墨西哥改用金匯兑本位制，鷹洋停止鼓鑄，而袁像銀元，又逐年增鑄，其成色及洋厘，雖與鷹洋有别，而社會上之普通行使，多計其個數，而不遑細算其重量成色。於是格雷欣法則發生，英洋之存底日鷁　薄，洋銀行之於收解兑換，勢不能再專用鷹洋。民國八年六月，上海本國銀錢二業與洋銀行協商，取消鷹洋洋厘行市，新幣一律通用。嗣而銀元洋行市，且單開袁像新幣一種。凡江南·湖北·廣東等，一律行使，其他各種本國銀元之重量成色過低者，陸續收回改鑄，民旣稱便，各埠亦紛紛響應，洋厘蓋從此而得統一矣。洎乎國民政府成立，總理幣出世，洋厘仍統一無碍，此爲洋厘統一時期。然而銀兩固始終未失其計算上之主幣資格，凡以銀元爲記賬計算者。仍不得不虚定一［不動的洋厘］爲單位，而將逐日開出之洋厘，相爲整理，質實言之，銀元仍不過一種雜幣而已。</p>
<p>今也，竟以上海錢業之决議而固定洋厘矣。夫洋厘而固定，雖爲取消銀元之行市也可。謂爲取銷洋厘也亦可，此誠廢　用元運動之初步成功，而金融界數十年之大變局也。在財政經濟史上可以劃分一時代，愚於此。不禁重有感焉。（一）幣制上之感想貨幣爲易中之具，本身之價格當不變，　諸度量衡所以權衡百物者也，其本身之標準，始終不變。惟其不變，故可爲授受之準則，爲交易之媒介，此貸幣學上之通義也。我國自有清開鑄銀元以還，國家立法，久以之爲主幣。而實際上則銀元旣有行市式之洋厘，其本身且須受銀兩之權衡，何有平貨幣之資格，又遑　乎其爲主幣，實不過一種雜幣而已。故廢兩用元之議，但之數十年，整理幣制之説，汗牛充楝，實際授受之通貨，銀兩又遠不及銀元，而銀元終未得取銀兩之地位而代之，以完成其主席幣之資格者胥以此也。夫久已定爲國幣之銀元，且未取得其貨幣之資格，則本位問題之討論，幣制改革之研究，皆非當前之要論。易詞以言之，卽惟廢兩用元，乃可以開始言幣制耳，所以此次上海錢業之决意用銀元爲主幣，誠値得輿論之種贊，此種［銀元爲主幣］之術語，一般人容或未能了解，實則洋釐旣不取銷而取銷，其本身之價格已無變動，凡記賬計算上，均得直捷了當，取以爲單位幣。此外若無限法償，若自由鑄造等要素。法律上且已明白規定，銀元之主幣資格，固已完全矣。他　面銀兩一項，在最近之將來，似與銀元成爲一種跛行本位，實則銀元主幣之資格旣立，銀兩已失其權衡各幣之憑藉，其將淘汰爲一種貨物式的生銀，無容疑也。　　雖然，此種理論，或尚過於樂觀也。何以言之？夫洋厘自英洋人口以來，幾經變化，始底於近今之錢業决議固定。此其原因，謂爲出於朝野之廢兩用元運動耳，謂爲由於社會上銀元之已臻劃一，亦無不可。蓋惟銀元已臻劃一，斯行使乃得便利，洋厘乃得爲單一的穩定耳。近月政府另鑄新幣之説，甚　塵上，其重量成色，未知究將若何，設與現行者發生參差，則洋厘仍得爲單一的穩定乎？銀元仍得保持其整齊的狀態乎？若其整齊狀態不能保持，則銀元自身間將起問題，能防銀兩制度不變相復活乎？此其未必能樂觀一也。二一　者，愚嘗者論，以爲廢　用兀問題之障碍，有若干原因出於一兩［元］本身之系統。申言之，卽兩雖爲虚幣，而保有歷時極久之士進制。設賬計算上不無便利。銀元雖　國幣，而其吳所謂輔幣者角洋銅元等，日有行市，殊無幣的資格。習用旣久。整雜判然，故元用不易抬頭。今洋厘固定矣，銀兩等於廉止矣，而銀元之本身系統，仍未確立。質實言之。國幣條例中侵存銀元一種耳，一切輔幣，謂爲尚未成就可也，如之何，而能謀運用上之便乎？此其未必能樂觀者又一也。</p>
<p>（二）錢業勢力感想錢業有悠久之歷史，外人所稱爲ＮativeBANKS者也。譽之者頌其樸實穩固，毁之者目爲守舊算小，實則守舊卽形成樸實穩固之美德，而愼小惜微，又爲經商者所未可厚非者也。且以其守舊之點言，則誠守舊矣，若以其進化之點言，固亦有足稱者。故在我國金融界，始終占有多量之勢力。例如，述之洋厘問題，如雜種龍洋行市之取消，英龍洋行市之劃一等，無一不得其助業中人向修言洋厘行市之决定，權在錢業，又謂除少數有名銀行外，外人及洋銀行對於錢業之信任心，過於銀行，要亦有幾分眞理。此次上海錢業之决定洋厘，其影響之遠大，尤無容諱言。然業中人其能再善用此潜勢力，以助長幣制金融之改善乎？抑沾沾自足，甘爲被動的推進乎？或竟横生阻碍，以妨害各方之進展乎？此殆非制度的問題，而爲人的問題矣。</p>
<p>洋厘中之一二五問題，及二五問題，卽錢業之爲人目爲算小者也，而業中人能毅然取消之，今洋厘定，而銀兩換算率又起矣。在最近之將來。銀兩猶當行使，甚望業中人能貫澈取消。頭之初衷，勿於此中博計算上之不當利得，須知近月之取消扣頭與夫固定厘價，廢除銀兩主幣制，與其謂爲毁時機，毋若認爲已落後也，與其謂爲主動的，不如目爲被動的之爲愈也。</p>
<h3 id="c154">當前問題之戰時經濟 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 茅震初</p>
<p>有關中國生死存亡的熱河戰爭，終於被野心的暴日揭開了序幕！這次的戰爭，其關鍵之重要旣如此，毋待説應該傾中國所有的人力財力物力來應付這戰爭。在前方，當然是［人力］最集中的地方，用血肉和敵人衝擊，在後方應該將［財力］和［物力］都集中起來，應付環境之變化。鑒於過往世界大戰時的事實，吾以爲實有厲行戰時經濟組織的必要。</p>
<p>當一九一四年至一九一八年世界大戰的時候，所有英·法·德·奥·俄·意等國，整個的經濟組織捲入了戰爭的漩渦之中，没有不臨時實行一切的經濟政策去應付這　非常的狀態。英國在大戰爆發之初，經濟就立刻全部動摇，交易所閉鎖，國外匯兑斷絕，金融恐慌，産業不安。因此政府方面卽刻頒布延長銀行停業日以及債務支付停止的命令，把所有鐵道，保險等事業移歸國營。一九一四年八月六日更施行一管理通貨及紙幣法令］、TheCurrency　and　Ba</p>
<p>nk　Noct　Asct	M　同時將以前頒布的銀行條例廢止，以限制各銀行紙幣的發行。法國政府也和英國一樣，初則下令交易所關於契約上的履行一律延期，繼則頒布債務緩付命令，爲實行救濟財界的困難籌劃軍隊的出動費用起見，祇有用中央銀行的力量來支配財政。但是戰爭的範圍遂漸擴大起來，單靠中央銀行這一些力量是無濟於事的，爰於一九一四年八月末改組内閣，始决定李波的戰時財政政策。這政策的基礎在於發行不兑現紙幣，以充當戰費。後因此項紙幣汜濫全國，卽用一種政府長期債券來收回，同時迭增税收，用度難關。德國比較的在事前早有了準備。在一九一三年（卽大戰前一年）卽秣馬厲兵以待一朝儘量把陸海軍擴張起來。因此在那時一方發行巨額的軍事特種公債，一方卽徴收五萬萬元的浩大的直接財産賦課金。所以事實上開戰以後並不再向國民有什麽徴收。等到戰火一開，首先蒙受直接影響，當然是實業，貿易，海運等　。因貿易曁海運業的打擊，向來仰給於外國的糧食和原料品同時感到缺乏，惹起了有關係的諸製造工業的困難，尤以軍需口製造的困難爲甚。於是設置原料局，成立德意志電氣協社等務使全德各種工業團體一心一德的爲戰爭這一個月的總動員。而占德意志戰時經濟該重要地位的厥惟食糧問題。雖則政府方面想盡種種的方策，有如限制毅價的過分騰貴，制定限價，規定用小麥麵包和了萊伊麥及馬鈴薯作爲軍用麵包，成立戰時毅物機關，所有毅物供給由政府專賣制度下支配，並强制的發行麵包券分給人民使用等等，然而最後終於因爲被困於協約國的封鎖，食料一層　於山窮水盡的地步。其他協約國方面如日·美·等國也同樣的人於極度混亂狀態，更以貨幣價格的狂跌，世界任何一處都蒙受影響。</p>
<p>所以一到廣大的戰爭開始以德，一切都失了常態，雖則像德國那樣在戰前已有準備，尚且要恐慌到如此地步，何况在戰前没有準備！現在，我們和敵冦事實上已是到交戰狀態，祗少了形式上的宣戰，處這樣的一個危急之秋，在經濟上怎麽可以没有組織照我的管見，財政方面旣有歐戰時成法可援，由政府參酌國内民生實業，製定一種適宜方法去實行。一人力］方面注重於軍　者居多，讓軍事當局去籌劃。最没有把握的恐怕還在［物力］方面。平常我們的日用必需之品，十九仰給外洋，萬一也和德國同樣的處於被敵人封鎖的時候，豈不和德國一樣的將陷於絕境麽。正好外國現在都在鬧着生産過剩，不妨利用這一點趁海口未被封鎖以前，舉凡軍需，日用，必需之品大量的向海外採購，（當然是指國貨中所没有的或者不多的而）這以備持久之戰。有人説中國去年豐收，食糧方面可　問題。實際這種觀察也是錯誤的。原來去年的糧食過剩是一種變態的而非正軌的。依歷年來洋米進口的統計字數的推知，以及目前湖北等省匪區災區荒區地域的廣大，福建，廣東，等省的食料缺乏來觀察，若不設法廣儲糧食，决不能持久作戰！我們以爲在事實上實有利用國外小麥等過剩農産品充作糧食準備的必要。此外，還應該用民衆的努力設置各種分工合作的機關。如調查機關，運輸機關，徴集機關，分配穖關等等一切的一切都集中起來，以適應此戰時的特殊經濟局面，方才可以使軍事上有充實的後盾。</p>
<h3 id="c155">中國之婦女與經濟 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 唐摩增</p>
<p>（一）婦女在過去及現在經濟組織中所占之地位　　研究中國過去及現在經濟上之進步，論者往往重視於男子之創造，而忽略婦女之貢獻，實則在過去之經濟史上，婦女實占有重要之地位，在現代經濟組織，有賴婦女之助力亦多，推測未來情形，婦女所負之使命，更爲重大，尤不可忽視。今請先言過去，我國自古以農立國，而農業之發展，實賴男女之分工，古籍中往往有［男耕女織］之紀載，又云：［一夫不耕，或］爲之飢，一女不織，或爲之寒，］國語敬姜論勞逸一篇，後世尤傳爲美談，可知婦人之勞工，亦屬促進經濟組織之原動力，不可忽視。在西洋各國經濟演進之程序中，婦女貢獻亦甚重要，希臘馬時代，男子之生活，多消磨於戰爭之中，故農業事務，由婦女担任者甚多。工業革命後，生産力法一變，婦女在工業界，亦極活動，吾國亦有此種情形，就物質上言，在都市中之女工，爲數極多，均在工廠中工作，據調查，現今我國全國女工人數，占職工百份之三十至四十之間，不得謂少，就服務及專門職業上而言，現時吾國婦女在商界服務者，數漸增加，（如銀行公司等）至於在藝術方面有貢獻者，如對於音樂美術文學各方面，均有特出之人材，預料將來吾國婦女在社會中一躍而與男子處同等之地位，共同合作，以求社會經濟之進步，　非不可能之事也。</p>
<p>（二）婦女爲今日改造中國經濟社會之重要份子　　中國婦女在過去歷史上，旣已與男子共同創造此現有之經濟社會，則現代婦女自應繼續前人進取之精神，努力於改造今日之經濟組織，此層可分數點言之：</p>
<p>（一）關於消耗者論者以爲今日中國經濟上之危機，由於消耗與生産不能適應所致，以十六七世紀之生産形式，而爲二千世紀之消耗，雙方失其平衡，國民生計，自不免瀕於破産，此言甚有見地。按儉爲美德之一種，原爲吾民族之長處，近十數年來，社會風尚，日趨奢靡，農村中居民無謂之浪費可少，至在擲市，奢侈之風，已成習慣，長此以往，前途大堪憂懼。按消耗原有分爲生産的消耗與非生産的消耗一種，其間利弊，相去甚遠，譬如在農塲中採用利生産方法，　置機器，雖屬消耗，乃　有益而無損，更如吾人願求智識，　置　範，亦屬生産的消耗，至若購備奢華品，爲外貨推廣市塲，不但於社會無益而且有害，實爲非生産的消耗矣，前者在我國且有提倡之必要，後者不啻自殺政策，不可不辨也。</p>
<p>（二）關於生産者今日我國婦女界，似於利用資本之道，未能講求透澈，投機者多而投資者少，鄉村中婦女，惟知　藏，貨棄於地，其爲失策，自不待言。卽在都市中，能充分利用資本者，亦不多見，爲今之計，當移其資本以出於推廣實業之一途，此其一。目前吾國資本尚嫌缺乏，則不能不設立各種機關以積貯之，婦女界當創立女子銀行，使國中資本之增加，此其二。方今經濟趨勢，瞬息千變，且處此商戰劇烈之世界，我國婦女當及早培養商業基本智識，以爲服務社會之準備，此層做到，則他日領袖人才必多，而我國現今商業缺乏人材一層困難，亦可迎刄而解矣，此其三。又所謂生産者，有狹義與廣義之分，依狹義的解釋，乃屬財富之創造，依廣義的解釋，則凡對於人羣之服務，皆隸屬之，婦女界苟能投身社會，爲人羣謀福利，卽屬有用人材，非謂必須如農工二階級，始得稱爲生産者，此其四也。</p>
<p>（三）關於分配者分配雖非吾國當今最嚴重之經濟問題，然亦頗有討論之價值，與婦女界關係亦甚密切，社會財富之分配，究應以何者爲準則，頗難斷定。概括言之，一爲貴族學説卽主張社會財富應　某一特殊階級所有，帮遺産制爲主張此項學説者所同情，此學説之不妥，顯而易見，不必詳論。二爲社會主義學説，卽主張社會財富之分配，應視個人之需要爲衡，此説甚合情理，但個人之需要，不易測量，故此學説亦有令人不能滿意之處。三爲自由主義事説，卽主張財富應依照個人之生産能力（貢獻）而分配，報配與個人貢獻之大小成正比例，此學説乃根據於［適者生存劣者淘汰］之原則，最爲公允。理想境界，雖與現時吾國社會之實際消形，距離尚遠，但他日必有進此途徑之一日，吾國婦女而欲與男子同享分配上之平等者，不可不努力於此，蓋欲增加已身收人，捨努力外無他途也。現今國人習俗，以不勞而獲爲榮，以致生産份子日少，今後此種不良心理，亟須剷除。</p>
<p>（四）關於財政者　　現時吾國財政，腐敗萬分，在上者諱不公開，小民亦置而不問，今後欲納吾國財政於正軌者，民衆須羣起負此監督之責任。吾國婦女，現時須先獲得參政權，否則勢必權利少而　務多，縱欲監督財政而無由下手也，但麥政談何容易，斷經過長時期之奮鬧，方能普遍，如美國婦女選舉權運動，自一上八七年開始以來，直至一八五十年，始有成績，可見事非易易。至監督財政，在目前我國，於支出方面，當求其適當之限制，收入亦當研究其來源之是否正當，督促政府，厲特預算制，公債發行額，亦應限制，今日吾國婦女雖尚不能在政治上獲得何等勢力，但此類問題，不可不預爲研究，以爲他日實行監督財政之準備也。</p>
<p>（三）今後婦女界所應注意各點</p>
<p>婦女在經濟上所負之責任，如此之重大，必須充分發揮其能力，就自有之長處利用之，同時矯正一切弱點，庶可兩全，吾國婦女特長之虞甚多，有爲男子所不能及者，舉其大者而言：（一）精細，婦女處事恒較男子爲精細，不如男子辦事，易犯粗心浮躁之病，此項特性，於現代複雜之經濟組織，甚爲相宜。世界人勢所趨，各國經濟組織，日益複雜，吾國現今雖以農業經濟爲本，尚未完全人於工業時代，然過渡時期之紛亂情形，不易處理，商情預測，尤非易事，非有冷静之頭腦，精到之眼光不足以語此，吾國婦女最適宜之工作，如會計統計一類事務，將來在國中，必絕發達也。（二）道德，婦女於道德，甚見注重，服從法律，尤屬優點，此固由於社會對於婦女行動裁制之嚴厲，亦未始不由於婦女界本身之自愛也。我國習俗，輕商已成習慣，主要原因，實由於昔時一部份商人，壟斷舞弊，道德方面，爲人所詬病，因此社會人十所得印魚甚惡，商人在社會上地位，遂亦不能提高，（以前外邦學者，如法國之孟德斯鳩Ｍontesquieu亦嘗將其著述中，排斥中國商人）他日吾國婦女參加國内之種種經濟活動，當能掃除此種陋習，從事實上之表現，矯正外人此種謬謨之觀念。（三）節儉，此亦爲吾國婦女之美德，亟須保持者在，現今我國情狀之下，固不必一味的提倡窒欲學説，以自阻其經濟進步之源泉，但亦須認明一切非生産的支出，不可不嚴加限制，否則國民生計，非至破産不可，生産不妨新式，消耗仍須合於生産源則，吾國婦女節儉一習慣發揮之，足以挽救國運，况婦女占全國人口半數以上，設能竭力提倡，收效自宏，全國經濟，必能得有相當之裨益。</p>
<p>除上述諸長處外，今日婦女界更當將已身缺點，加以改正，現時經濟競爭，日益劇烈，欲使本身處於不敗地位，不可不抱有强毅之堅忍心，作事方能有成功之望，婦女似於此點，稍現欠缺，再吾國婦女界之通病爲眼光淺近，僅囿於現在而不能及將來，祇類及本身之利害關係，而不能爲社會計算，此項缺點，實爲發展中國經濟之一大障礙，若個人事業之失敗，猶其小焉者耳。又現代經濟趨勢，最重組織，故近代經濟事家往往於勞工土地資木而外，别加組織一項而成四大生産要素，其重要可見，吾國婦女界，誠欲於中國經濟社會中佔優勝地位者，更不可設法增進其組織能力也。</p>

<p>：人生每意須盡歡，莫使金樽空對月！］這是第二種方式：跳跳舞，喝喝洒，把歲月度所去就算。［　哄哄，你方唱罷找登場，反認他鄉是故鄉。甚荒唐，］到頭來，都是爲他人作嫁衣裳！一這是第三種方式：命定如此，一切都是徒然的。我們翻看文學上的作品，無論以什麽形式出現，他們的根本觀念，除了這種個人主義的［愁苦］，［頺廢享樂］。［定命］而外，還有别的健康意識没有？除了麻醉青年使苟安現狀而外，還有别的作用没有？飛來飛去，一隻隻灰色的猫頭鷹，呌出中華民族的死亡之音Ｌ五四運動以來的新文學作家，可曾跳出這個圈子没有？</p>

<p>— 穆時英</p>
<p>那天是五月節！太好的天氣！可是在都市裏，天還不够藍，太陽還不够明亮。我和珮珮上麗娃栗妲去，去找一個更廣闊的田野，一個更高大的天空，一點鐘頂年輕的時閥。　把城市丢在城市裏，我們在初夏的和風裏，到了郊外。渡過了蘇州河，是一條很長的小徑，兩旁有柳樹，柳條直拖到地上。走完那條小徑，便看到一片草地，一道河，一座紅屋子，一個音樂台，還有白的桌布，黑的咖啡，一溜婆娑的老樹，一些夢。</p>
<p>在那邊，麥田從村邊直伸到天邊。天邊有一株樹，樹上有一個烏鴉窠，樹旁有一垜籬笆，一座黑的瓦屋，從那兒溶溶地捲到村邊的就是麗娃栗妲河。</p>
<p>我們划了一隻狹長的雙漿游艇，划到水中央，讓牠隨流水淌。是一個流質的天空，没有雲。一陣喛風，就從天邊吹來了布榖烏的雙重的歌聲，吹着，吹着，從天邊吹到天邊，從麥田吹到麥田。那風，那歌聲，到飄到麥穗上，飄到水面上，又烟似地消散在珮珮的頭髮裏邊。</p>
<p>她太息了一下。我笑。</p>
<p>傍着船，一隻百鵝睡在波紋上，腦袋藏在翅膀下面。前面有一個俄國人也划着隻船。静的水静的天，静前田野，静的船，甚至那露在船沿上的穿了白襯衫的脊梁也是静的。只有那兩支漿在一起一落。珮珮的臉上有人陽光，一張黑而嬌紅的臉，健康的臉。我的鼻子上也有太陽光，我深深地呼吸了一下，想把牠吸進去。　我笑。她又太息了一下。</p>

<p>— 彭雪珍女士</p>
<p>［苦孩子！你不願意人家這樣呌你，］但，别蹶起你的小嘴兒來吧，你該學得耐性點兒！</p>
<p>昨天收到你姊姊自南寗來信，我眞奇怪呢，她跑得這麽遠。她告訴我，不得已把民民你留在家裏，很難受，我聽了也爲你歎息呢！</p>
<p>你不會記得的：前兩年的一個夏大，我第一回，也僅是這一回上你家來，找看見了我久已想看看的民民，那時你正赤着脚被她們罰坐在　子上，天熱得利害，你只穿一件汗坎肩，露着你那肌肉不結實的小臂，你嚷着要下地，可是她們不給你鞋穿。你眞掘强呢，你不肯呌我。我至今還忘不了你那靈活的小眼睛，那笑起來只剩一條線縫的小眼睛。　　你姊姊陪我狂南湖，你要跟，她固執着不肯，等我們走出大門，你被老媽子抱進去了，老遠的還聽得見你的響亮的哭聲。你一定在想：姊姊只管朋友不管民民了，是不是？</p>
<p>在烟雨樓，我説：［民民太右憐了！］你姊姊没説什麽，只輕輕地嘆了口氣。民民，從她深鎖着的眉頭，我瞧出她是多麽愛你！</p>
<p>前年，你姊姊來，狂滄浪，望着那迢遠的田野和青天，她又想着你，那大大嬸嫌民民脾氣壞，囑咐你乖點兒，民民民民却仰着小臉嚴肅地説：［民民没媽］管啊！］你説得眞好！眞有你的，民民，六七歲的孩子就能説這樣的話，你懂得没媽愛撫的孤苦，你記得那死去已二年的媽媽嗎？好，你就永遠記念着她吧，這是應當的！</p>
<p>你是一個機伶的孩子，小嘴裏常吐出比大人還天眞可又還深刻的話。所以你姊姊常説：這孩子得有人小心招管，太伶俐。</p>
<p>不是嗎，你爸爸前年接着又死了，哥哥姊姊都做事，你於是便跟着四處跑，六歲的孩子住幼稚園，據説你在那邊很乖，可是太拘束，不那麽活潑了。你太懂事吧，還是小朋友們欺了你？民民，告訴我！</p>
<p>你姊姊如今走遠了，你周圍更少了親人，放學回來忘不了滿處找姊姊吧？她到那盛長着芭蕉棕橺的南國去了，你爲這個哭過没有？</p>
<p>你承認自已是苦孩子嗎？你該堅决地摇摇你的小腦袋：民民不苦！民民有哥哥疼，有姊姊愛，有大嬸喜歡！你聰明，是，你就得多　點兒事：苦孩子這世界多得很，你看見街坊人家的没吃底穿底的小朋友嗎？你該好好兒唸書，好好兒玩，不苦的日子在後頭哪！拿出點魄力來，瞧瞧這比你姊姊買給你的老虎臉子還要獰惡的世界，那時候你才知道你是不是苦孩子！</p>
<p>笑一笑罷！院中小樹萌芽了嗎？孩子是和那青綠的芽兒一樣有希望的，尤其是咱們苦孩子！</p>

<p>— 蕭伯訥作　宜閑譯</p>
<p>那術士怔住了，然而立卽和葛地微笑了。他回等道，［我們不要使這成爲私人的問題呵。］　　［然而，如果不是私人的問題，那是没有意思的，黑女孩子説。［要是照著你對我所説，］</p>
<p>我應該怎樣！我對你説我愛你！你没有感覺到我在唐突你麽？］</p>
<p>［當然没有，］那術士説。［你不可這麽想。雖然你黑我白，可是在那將我們造得這樣的神］的前面，我們却是平等的。］</p>
<p>［我　没有這麽想，］黑女孩子説。［當我説的時候，我没有説自已是黑人而你不過是可憐的白人。請將我當作白人的女王將你自已當作白人的王罷。這有什要緊呢？你何必發呆？］　　［那里。那里］那術士説。［哦，我是可憐的白人裏最可憐的人；可是我却也將我自已當］作王呢。這是當人們的邪惡逼到我發狂了的時候。］</p>
<p>［我見過還要壞的那些王呢，］黑女孩子説；［你用不着害羞的。哦哦，照聖書裏那樣，你］</p>
<p>來做所羅門王，我來做示巴女王罷。我到你這裏來，説我愛你。這意思就是來佔有了你。我抱着雌獅的　來在吃你，便你成爲我自已的一部分。從此以後，你只得想到使我愉快的事，不能想到使你愉快的事了。我要站在你和你自已之間，你和神之間，這可不是可怕的專制麽？愛这東西是吃人的。你能够想像内中有着愛的天國麽？</p>
<p>［我的天國裏是没有别的甚麽的。除愛以外，還有甚麽是天國呢？］那術士大胆地，但也不舒服地説。</p>
<p>［還有光榮。那是神的象，神的思想的家：那邊没有甚麽旖旌風流，没有甚麽像虱子釘着］羊身似的纒綿。我　務師，那敎士是談着愛的；然而她却逃避了她的一切情人，却做神的工作了。那些白人一見我就轉過眼去，惟恐自已要愛上我。有些男男女女的隊夥，專心幹着神的工作，他們自稱爲敎兄弟，敎姊妹，却没有互通聲氣。］</p>
<p>［他們　透了，］那術士説。</p>
<p>［自然呵，這是愚蠢的，］黑女孩子説。［我們不得不和人們生活在一起，我們必須滿意於］</p>
<p>他們纔是。然而，我們的靈魂需要着孤獨，正同我們的肉體需要着愛一樣，這呆不是明明白白的麽？我們需要着彼此肉體的帮助，和彼此精神的帮助：然而我們的靈魂　有着單獨伴着神的必要；每逢人們來愛你，來要你的靈魂以及你的精神和肉體的時候，你這樣的呌罷，［不要近攏來：我屬於我自已，不屬於你。］你的那一種［相愛一論，對於尋求着神的我，侮辱］</p>
<p>得比對於爲反對奴隸制度和殺人而必須戰爭的武士，或是不殺戮就得眼見自已的子女餓死的獵人更惡劣。］</p>
<p>［那麽，我可以説［你們得互相殘殺；這一條給你的誡律：］麽？］那術士説。</p>
<p>［這不過是從先前那句話翻過來説法，［黑女孩子説。［也不是生活法則。老實對你説，你的這種萬應　誡律好像江湖郎中賣給我們的丸藥：二十趟衷用得着一趟，還有十九趟是不中用的。况且，我不是尋求着誡律。我是尋求着神。］</p>
<p>［你繼續尋求罷，願神和你同在，］那術士説。［你必須經過我，纔找得到這樣的神，你去］尋找罷，］説到這里，他不見了。</p>
<p>［這大約是你的拿手好戲了，］黑女孩子説；［可是我失了你，倒也有些不好過；因爲我心］裏覺得你是可愛的男子，你心地也好。］</p>
<p>她再前進了一哩，便遇到了一個古老的漁夫，他的肩胛上，背着一個巨大的敎堂。</p>

<p>— 莊貞</p>
<p>綠悠悠的大海，碧沉沉的大海，波濤洶湧着的大海，閃着金色的太陽，銀色的月亮的光的大海……自古至今，不知這受過多少墨客詩人的咏嘆，給了他們多少的安慰，多少的鼓勵，多少的感慨！然而科學家眼中所看見的海，似乎和詩人所見的完全兩樣！</p>
<p>據許多科學家説，這成爲詩人文士之［詩的情緒］之源泉的大海，是世間最大的寳藏，我們可以從海裏掏出燦爛的金銀來。他們研究的結果，説每一噸海水含有十兞（Ｍilligramme）的銀故若以全世界海水總量十二萬七千萬立方　。而全世界人口總數十五萬萬計算，每一個人可以得到價值九百萬元的銀塊之分配。至於金的含量則比銀更多，據説每一噸海水平均含有五十兞的金，故若按上述全世界人口總數分配起來，每人可以得到四萬八千兙的金塊！</p>
<p>朋友，你説窮困嗎？然向你所應該分得的産財却是這樣的多，不過散藏在海水果吧了！</p>
<p>［海底掏金］，這話誰還能夠加以嘲笑！一些作着黄金夢的化學家，好幾年前就已從事於［海水還金］［海水還銀］的研究了，現在還不斷地在做着實騐呢！</p>

<p>日本國民對於軍人的崇拜、對於武力的信仰、大約始於日俄戰爭、當時日本以蝦夷島國、戰敗雄踞歐亞兩洲的俄羅斯、其雄壯氣象、自可想見、這便是日本軍閥所以能跋扈、黷武主義所以能成爲全國民衆信仰中心的一個總原因、因此日本軍人、亦遂成爲全國人民中的特殊階級、陸軍人物如參謀總長閑院宮·陸軍大臣荒木貞夫·敎育總監林銑十郎·陸軍航空本部長渡邊錠太郎·陸軍技術本部長緒方勝一·關東軍司令官武藤信義等的身世事蹟、早爲世人所熟悉、可以不必説起、現在我們要就日本軍界中、略説其次要的陸軍人物、</p>
<p>（一）士官第九期畢業生</p>
<p>日本陸軍士官學校的第九期畢業生、在軍界中特别佔得優勢、如眞崎·本莊·阿部·松井·荒木·林·山本·等諸中將、均身</p>

<p>（四）敎育總監部的未來人才</p>
<p>敎育總監部部長香椎浩平中將、爲士官第十二期畢業生、前任駐華北日軍司令官、爲天津事變的指使者、依日本向來習慣、自任敎育總監部部長後、不久均將遷掌大權、如宇垣一成·岸本鹿太郎·林銑　郎·荒木貞夫等、即其先例、則香椎之將遷昇、亦必不能例外了、砲兵監烟俊六中將、與香椎同年畢業、雖其現在的位置尚低、但其前途是絕有希望的、彼係故烟英太郎的胞弟、砲兵科出身、曾任野重砲第四旅旅長、參謀本部第四部部長及第一部部長、他是一個軍事家、在敎育總監部内爲有數的名將最近的將來、亦將榮遷參謀次長了、</p>

<h3 id="c219">推行女警察的應聲 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 賡</p>
<p>自各報把［内部十六日咨各省政府請推行女子警察］的新聞揭示、一班對於女子另用一種［愛克司光］看待的人們，更比前幾年乍然聽到女子投考縣長的消息，還要加倍駭異。因爲女子投考縣長，是破天荒的創舉，姑且不説，但是走馬上任之時，按照起縣官老爺，太太小姐諸稱謂的法規，百姓們要怎樣稱呼她？更要怎樣的稱呼她的他？已把這班人自擾得百思莫解：如今推行女警察的問題，雖説猶步歐美之後塵，但在我們貴國終算遠從天外飛來，那能不呌他們大驚小怪？</p>
<p>其實，適合社會的需要，順應世界的潮流的時代前進之輪，畢竟不會因爲一些反動之力而站住。此一新聞，一般女同胞界的新青年，公然竟有些眉飛色舞，陰氣勃勃的討論得個結果：［要幹就幹義勇軍去，以便和前綫戰士們一樣］殺敵。］！這是多麽替女界吐奇氣的豪語，聞之，眞不禁有［風蕭蕭兮易水寒］之感！</p>
<p>中國人口，號稱四萬萬七千萬，可是實際上若無占有半數的女同胞，一致敵愾同仇的實行武装起來，那末全國總動員共赴國難之口號，不將一變而爲全國半動員耶？</p>
<p>試一翻閲古老的國史，例如木蘭征戍十二年，號［娘子軍］的唐平陽公主之能助太宗定天下，梁紅玉之能親執桴鼓助戰，并與士卒同力役，秦良玉之能饒膽識，善騎射，而屢平宼亂，是史不絕書的炳炳爛爛的女戰功，已成千古美談；至於去歲東北義勇軍中，亦有身騎白馬，不知姓名的女將軍，苦戰而死的新聞見稱於世，那更足以證明汗馬功勞，非鬚眉所得而專，殺敵致果，縱巾幗亦能特告奮勇也！</p>
<p>［要幹就幹義勇軍去，以便和前綫戰士們一樣殺敵］在此悲歌慷慨，壯氣足撼山岳的口號之下，當有不少的其他有志女青年，應聲而起，立赴前方去做實際工作，或組織救護隊，吾人謹當備下羔羊美酒，掬誠以餞壯行！</p>

<p>之於胸懐］。</p>
<p>失戀的人這樣憤憤地説：</p>
<p>［難道説女人是這樣的可愛，戀愛］是這樣的甜蜜，須得用黄金的上獻和雙膝的下跪來購換麽？……我不相信這世上有這許多愚蠢的人們，永是歡喜鏈結了自已成爲奴隸心而去愛那些拜金的女人們……］</p>
<p>男女是這樣的不平等麽？尤其是布爾喬亞的人們！</p>
<p>［大學府］的體育館的門前貼着佈告［凡着皮鞋者請勿入内］，這張堂堂佈告張貼後的結果：男生們是唯命是從的在跑進體育館的門前先要估量估量自已如否有換了平底鞋，至於一般東宮裏的宮主們呢？却還未曾放棄她們的高跟鞋，嗚呼！一樣皮鞋，兩種看法，天下不平之事孰有甚於斯哉？</p>
<p>據説這是有類乎阿Ｑ式的戀愛癩蝦蟆想不到天鵝肉吃，他偏對人説：［這個女郎我根本是不喜歡的］。！！這，其實與狐狸得不到葡萄吃，而説這葡萄是酸，反正一樣，</p>
<p>一般初次新婚的女子們，大家都惴惴於被男人們的遺棄而跌入了苦陷裏。有一首日本的俳句寫得很好，這正可論當今我國的女子代作呻吟的哭訴：</p>

<p>這是過去的心願了。</p>

<p>再進去，便是會客室，左右都是甬道，明净的鋼窗，光線是那麽充足，遮在窗上的帘兒，半掩半啓的掛在那裏，室的中間，放着一張大圓桌，圍着圓桌放着許多椅子，四角裏又放着四張籐的圓桌，圓桌的周圍，又各配上四張籐椅　　每天下午五時以後，或是星期日和星期六的下午，那麽會客室裏的凳子，怕没有一張空着了。</p>

<p>— 林蘭妹</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是個年華雙十的弱女子；也曾在小學裏讀過幾年書，後因經濟關係，不能升學，至今老是在家裏操持家務。每想找一個事情做做；不是位置太壞，有被人侮辱之虞，因此自已不肯去遷就，便是他們懸格太高，什麽大學畢業，中學畢業等等，拒我於千里之外。我家中有二位年已六旬向外的父母，上無兄姊，下無弟妹，一點没有倚靠。在這生活程度高貴的時代，天天感覺到很尖鋭的壓迫，若要想起我們相依爲命的三個人的前途，那眞是要使你寢食不安呢！眼看一般從容的人，天天享樂，怎能不又羡又妒呢。</p>
<p>前年由同學介紹，得識一位羅君；他很合我的理想，並且也非常愛我。他曾經向我求婚，當時我心裏本是情願的，不過念到［雙親無我，何以終餘年］，所以唖口無言，涙如雨下。弄得他莫明其妙，再三追間，我就祇好掬誠相告：我説［我本人並無何種條件，最重要的］，就是你開否照　我父母到底呢！］他聽了此言，面有難邑，停了許久，他才説［可惜我也是個苦命男子，每月的新］水，很是有限；還有老母弱弟，靠我扶育呢？］因此我倆的婚姻，就不得不忍痛割絕。此後他雖則時常來説，［希望我每月的收入，有一天加增到相當數量，我倆仍舊可以舉行結婚。］現在呢？他因爲抝不過老母的主張，於去年冬季，與别的女子結婚了。我聽到這個消息，好似一個囚犯，在法庭上聽到法官宣告他的死刑一般，有苦也説不出了。一直到現在，羅君還時常有信來，安慰我，勸我不要過分悲傷；但是我呢，竟愈勸而愈辛酸了。唉！</p>
<p>編者先生，人是生而平等的，我又没有做過虧心的事，爲什麽要怎樣苦呢。難道眞是前世事嗎？（下略）</p>
<p>林蘭妹謹上</p>
<p>編者按：讀了林女士的來信，不由你不鼻子裏發酸；她的身世，何等的可憐呀。所以她雖則不是一個店員工友或學徒，我們也不得不在此公開討論一下。</p>
<p>不錯［人是生而平等的］。不過這是［一種主張，見解，理想罷了。古今中外］，從來没有實現過。有種人，就生而富貴，有種人，就生而貧賤。但這决不是前世事，這是萬惡的資本主義所造成的。我們要求平等，怨天尤命是不中用的，我們應該向這萬惡的社會進攻，才是出路。</p>
<p>林女士的擇婿的標準，是要找一個男子，能夠照顧她父母到底，這就難了！現在生活程度日高，一個男子，養一個妻子，已經要臭汗一身，所以［女子要有自立的本領一的呼聲，到處可以聽到；那裹還有能力照顧你的父母呢。你要養你的父母，是你的孝道，可敬之至，但是你祇可出買你自已的心力，去成全這個願望。在現社會裏，要找一個夫婿，來照顧你的父母，實在是不容易呀！即使有一般席豐履厚的貴公子，可以担任，那你就不免要終身氣呢！至於女子的職業，有的當然要有相當資格，但也有可以無須十分高深學問的。講到有些位置，雖説有被人侮辱之虞，但是只要自已拿得定，就不怕了。所以我們勸林女士趕快去找個事情做，拿所得的代價，來奉養父母，婚姻是另一問題·不要再把養父母的問題混進去。羅君是業已有婦，無可挽回；但第二個羅君，也不難再覓，所以也毋庸過分悲傷。不知我們這個忠告，會不會使你格外辛酸呀！</p>

<h3 id="c227">蘇聯電影的過去及未來 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 黃君如</p>
<p>自從此次上海大戲院開映蘇聯聲片［生路］後，引起滬上一般人士的Ｓensafi</p>
<p>ono其所以如此者，不僅是因爲該片具有一種獨特的風格，與向來提倡享樂主義爲主體的　美影片作風不同，而且是因爲牠能夠指出人生的進路。但是現時蘇聯國内的電影事業，以及蘇聯電影對於國外輸出的情形是怎樣呢？我想這也必是一般人們所急欲知足的。故現將其情形簡單的介紹於下：</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯電影新五年計劃</p>
<p>電影化與電化，化學化，汽車化等，同爲現時蘇聯的主要口號。去年蘇聯住民的電影觀覽次數，大人每人平均十回。倘以都市和農村分别論，則都市二十一回，農村五六回。蘇聯政府爲使國民與電影更加親近，在第二次五年計劃中，計劃普遍電影網。豫定在俄羅斯共和國增加三倍影戲院，特别是注意中小民族地帶，如同共和國内的中亞加薩克斯坦，將增加六倍半影戲院；新設四萬二千二百四十四電影俱樂部；國營其營農塲等農業中心地帶，建築三百一十間最新式的電影大戲院；勞動者農民俱樂部等，全部設備放映電影臺。預計在九三七年，即第二次五年計劃的最終年度，全聯邦電影觀覽人員總數，達對三十億。觀覽回數，大人每人四十八回，即與第一次五年計劃末年度比較如次：　　一九三二年　一九三七年</p>
<p>都市　　二十一回　五十六回</p>
<p>農村　五回！六回　　四十一回</p>
<p>從此可見，第二次五年計劃，不僅是使國民的觀覽次數，從平均十回增加至四十八回，同時是使都市住民與農村住民的觀覽次數漸漸接近。　　（二）蘇聯影片的輸出額</p>
<p>蘇聯影片，雖因其主題及技術之特殊性，頗受各國觀衆之愛好；然因其思想的内容時觸各國檢閲之忌諱，致得不到輸入公開的自由；且因租費頗昻，故至今輸出額，尚未達到最大的數目。去年從一月至九月，其輸出額僅五萬九千廬布（重量二噸），比一九三一年度的三萬四千盧布（重量一噸）增加二萬五千盧布云。</p>
<h3 id="c228">鮑才琪導演之［戰地情天］ <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 郭聲宏</p>
<p>的確，佛蘭克鮑才琪導演的［七重天，］予世界人士以深刻的印象，因此，他老人家就於一九三一年當選爲世界十大導演家之一。</p>
<p>前數年，他應了世界影迷熱烈的要求，開始導演［戰地情天］，ＡＦarewell　lo　Arm劇情和［七重天］一樣的哀感頑艶，帶點俄國大文豪托爾斯泰巨著［復活］的色彩，該片描寫人生别離的悲哀非常深刻，全片都浸在悽楚的音樂和憂鬱的情調裏。</p>
<p>主角問題，佛蘭克鮑才琪鄭重選拔，像劉别謙選拔［璇宮艶史］主角一樣的小心翼翼，結果前年榮膺影藝學院桂冠女明星漢倫海絲Ｈelen</p>
<p>Hayes當選，男主角是老明星加萊古柏，Ｇr</p>
<p>ay　CorperAdcolphe　Menjou劇情是多麽的哀怨纏棉，悲泗流漓，誠怛人心。大意是述一個軍官於某鄉村中邂逅一女郎，他倆是夜竟發生戀愛關係，不久軍官赴前綫作戰，女郎在家誕生一孩，不幸夭殤，女郎望軍官歸來，消杳然，女郎積憂成疾，奄奄一息，此時軍官忽由前綫歸來，女郎僅於臨别之時，微開杏眼，向軍官微微苦笑，一縷芳魂，飄飄而去。正呌做［天長地久有時盡，此恨綿］綿無絕期！</p>
<h3 id="c229">再介紹［孽海雙鴛］ <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 平忱</p>
<p>將在新光開映</p>
<p>中國人是抱着家族主義的，對於嗣續念，也特别濃厚，往往節衣縮食，辛辛苦苦做一世牛馬，把這産給兒孫化用，這種人眞是愚不可及！</p>
<p>日本人攻入了榆關，義勇軍忍飢耐凍的拼命作戰，東北難民的流離慘狀，這些和富人們是漠不相干的。他們預備着把鉅大的家産，遺傳給兒孫，决不肯捐助一點給義勇軍或難民，至於他的兒孫，將來是敗子，是亡國奴，他是不會想到的！</p>
<p>天一公司有聲新出品［孽海雙鴛］，牠的中心思想，就是描寫遺産的流毒，牠明白告訴我們，遺産的對於子女，是［非徒無益而又害之］，同時又告訴我們，富人們應該把財産來創辦社會事業，爲羣衆謀福利。</p>
<p>［孽海雙鴛］是現實的描寫，對準着中國社會的病態而發的有力量的影片。還有一點值得介紹的，就是［孽海雙鴛］中有幾塲佈景，確夠得上［堂皇富麗］四字的按語。</p>
<p>從好萊塢歸來　蔣青</p>
<p>瑪麗德蘭潄在好萊塢服務的角色是慈愛的老婦，所以大家都呌伊［銀幕上的母親］可是伊的服務已有廿年以上，許多人料伊不久便要退休了。</p>
<p>賈克科根是夙負神童之譽的，可是他很頑皮。有一次他將他新製的襯衫剪上許多小洞，他却穿着到各街去。這是他的笑史之一頁。不過他近來却静默多了，原因是他聲言將退出銀壇，進州立大學去。</p>
<p>曼麗壁克馥在三年前剪修了她那黄金色的長髮而變成捲髮式，這樣伊覺得非常適合少婦的装束。</p>
<p>范朋克最喜練習遊狩槍擊等，每當酒酣耳熱時，他總要談起他的武技的。他近來漫遊世界，足跡徧各地，美國電影學會選爲一九三二年遊歷最多的明星。</p>
<p>却利卓别麟的［城市之光］映後，他仍堅决他的製片主張。他很有意攝一張［Ｎapoleon　Bona］</p>
<p>parte的片子，但仍未定。他或者仍要自兼編劇導演主角的。</p>
<p>却利法雷的唯一嗜好是收集舊物，郵票古幣珍玩之類。中國的織繡，也很歡喜。他説中國人很好交易的。</p>
<p>中國女明星黄柳霜漫遊歐陸，她似乎已倦厭了影戲的生涯。有人問她可要回她的祖國時，她只微笑而已。</p>

<p>大概誰都知道吧，電影界新進明星</p>
<p>王人美和黎莉莉就是明月社的台柱啊！</p>
<p>在明月社登台表演的時候，我做害篇文字，未免含有投機性質吧！</p>

<p>她和王人美被聯華歌舞班同時搜羅　　去以後，聯華歌舞班公演時，她也和我們相見過幾次。去年，聯華歌舞班解散，她也繼王人美而起，現身於銀幕。她的處女作是［火山情血］。這張片子公映後，她就得了一個［美人精］的綽號。（這好　與王人美的綽號［美人王］對立）的）。後來更有人稱她［甜姐兒］。她在聯華的第二張片子就是最近公映的［天明］了。但是這全是無聲的。我們在銀幕上聽見她的　　嬌聲，還從天一的［芭蕉棠上詩］始。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Main Force of the Rehe Army Fought Fiercely Between Lingyuan, Jianping, and Chifeng in Southern Ling Yesterday Morning <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Our Army Shortens Its Lines, Deploys Defenses Step by Step, and the Situation Is Solidified</p>
<p>Volunteer Armies from Various Places Gather Towards the Newly Constructed Defense Positions to Assist in the Battle</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Suffered Losses at Baishizui and Their Advance Has Been Halted</p>
<p>Chaoyang, Lingyuan, and Other Places Were Tragically and Fiercely Bombed by Enemy Aircraft</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde Telegram: The enemy army had six train carriages each on the 24th and 25th, arriving at Chaoyang Temple from Suizhong, numbering up to a brigade. After disembarking, they immediately moved towards Southern Ling. A large part had already arrived on the evening of the 25th. Fierce fighting began at 6:00 AM on the 26th. Our army deployed defenses along the Tiesongling mountain range from Yushulin Daxuzi. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde Telegram: Six Japanese troop trains, three stopping at Koubeiyingzi, three at Beipiao, carrying Japanese puppet troops, are preparing to advance southwest. Ammunition and supplies are also being unloaded and transported to the front line. There has been fighting in the Linglongta area of the second district of Southern Ling since the 25th. Lingyuan County was severely bombed by the Japanese army yesterday. On the Chaoyang front, our Dong brigade engaged fiercely with the enemy's Suzuki unit near Shuangmiao. The enemy army charged into our army's positions several times, but were repelled by our machine gun fire. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. Currently, all our front-line troops are concentrated at a new defense line in a certain area of the Ling-Chao Avenue. On the 25th, Southern Ling County was bombed by more than ten enemy aircraft, destroying civilian houses in the county town. The villages in the first and second districts of the county were also burned by the enemy. Our volunteer armies, Peng Zhenguo, Han Yunpu, and others, with more than 3,000 troops, are concentrating on the Lingyuan, Pingquan, and Fuxin defense lines. It is expected that a major battle between the main forces will take place in Lingyuan, Pingquan, Jianping, Chifeng, and other places. Currently, volunteer armies Li Haiqing, Feng Zhanhai, and others in Suidong, Fuxin, and other places in eastern Rehe are also gathering near Jianping. Tang Yulin, seeing that the Japanese side has launched a general offensive and the military situation on the front line is urgent, has decided to personally go to the front line in Lingyuan on the afternoon of the 26th to supervise the battle. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin telegraphed today, stating that according to a phone report from Brigade Commander Dong on the afternoon of the 25th, the Japanese army, in conjunction, launched a fierce attack on our Chaoyang defense area from the left flank with a large number of artillery fire. At 7:00 PM, the Second Battalion of the Baisakayingzi Infantry had retreated to Hebei and is currently being reorganized to the Baiyao position, where fierce fighting is still ongoing. According to another telegram from Brigade Commander Dong, the Dong regiment of his unit has launched a counterattack on Baisakayingzi and recovered the position late on the 25th. They are currently confronting the enemy and have strictly ordered the unit to defend the position with all their might. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The battle situation in Chaoyang is chaotic. The two pagodas and the post and telegraph office in the Yuren Temple in the city have been bombed by Japanese aircraft. Our Dong Futing brigade has built a new defense line near Chaoyang, firmly preventing the Japanese army from advancing. Last night, there was a telegram to Ping reporting that the Kai-Cui brigade had also built a new defense line between Chifeng and Kailu, about three hundred li from Kailu. The enemy is paying the most attention to both Chifeng and Southern Ling. Our Cui brigade is still holding firm in northeastern Chifeng. The enemy is reinforcing Southern Ling in preparation for an attack, and we are also reinforcing that area from Lingyuan. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The battle of Rehe is fiercest in Southern Ling. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lingyuan Telegram: Four Japanese bombers flew to Lingyuan at 10:00 AM on the 26th and dropped seven bombs on the city. One bomb did not explode. Japanese aircraft also went to the Yebachou and Jianping areas. Losses are unknown. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin announced to European and American reporters that in order to concentrate forces, the defense lines have been shortened. If the Japanese army invades, they will launch a full-scale attack. The main battles in the future will be in Lingyuan and Chifeng. The morale of the front-line soldiers is extremely high, vowing to fight the Japanese army to the end. Our army has deployed defenses step by step on the lines of Lingyuan, Pingquan, Jianping, and Chifeng, and the defense positions are extremely solid. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin telegraphed yesterday, ordering Dong Futing to defend the last defense line to the death, and has dispatched senior officials to go to a certain place on the front line this afternoon to command the battle. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) 10,000 Japanese infantry and 5,000 cavalry are advancing towards Southern Ling. The vanguard troops made formal contact with our forces on the evening of the 24th. We are focusing all our efforts on Southern Ling and Lingyuan because Chaoyang and Kailu have flat terrain and are not easy to defend, from north to Chifeng and Jianping. It is expected that the Japanese army will press forward step by step, and the main battle will be on the Lingyuan-Chifeng line. Our morale is extremely high, and everyone is prepared to fight to the death. However, there is a shortage of local food. Tang Yulin has telegraphed requesting assistance from all parties. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde Telegram on the evening of the 25th: The fierce battle in Chaoyang lasted for seven hours, and the enemy did not gain an inch. The avenue from Lingyuan to Chaoyang is guarded step by step by our army. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde Telegram at 11:00 PM on the 25th: The puppet army of Wang Weiqing, under Japanese cover, advanced towards Kailu. After being surrounded by the Cui brigade on three sides, more than 1,000 members of the puppet army were disarmed by us at Aigen Temple, and a Mongolian staff officer of Zhang Haipeng was captured. According to his confession, the Japanese army plans to advance on the plains and deserts with 300 armored vehicles. We have taken strict precautions. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to the bombing of Chaoyang by Japanese aircraft on Saturday night, the Chinese army abandoned the city after it was set ablaze. Dong Futing is determined to rebuild the defense line ten miles to the west. His four brigades are currently holding the line, starting from Chaoyang in the west and extending to Baishizui (southeast of Southern Ling). 30,000 Japanese troops are currently attacking along this 60-mile long line, but their advance has been halted. Kailu has also been destroyed by Japanese aircraft, so the Chinese army has abandoned it. The radio station, telegraph bureau, and post office there have been destroyed, and many civilian houses have been destroyed, with some still burning. There are no formal troops there, only volunteer armies currently fighting ten miles west of Kailu in Taixing and Taila (transliterations). However, it is difficult to hold the position because the area is part of the Gobi Desert, so it is impossible to dig defenses or trenches to avoid Japanese aerial bombardment. Because of the cold winds of the desert land, sand fills the sky, and trenches will be filled in a few hours. Since there is no defensible place in the Kailu area, it seems that the battle between the Japanese army and the Chinese regular army will be seen in Chifeng, 150 miles from Kailu. What is certain is that the volunteer armies will contain the Japanese army as they advance deeply. It is expected that the real war in Rehe will occur in Chifeng and Lingyuan. However, before the Japanese army reaches these two places, the price of their advance will be very high. It is reported that in this week's fighting, Chinese casualties alone totaled 500. The climate in both parts of Rehe is very good, but within Kailu, there are still violent winds, heavy snow, and sandstorms, and the temperature is extremely low. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, nine planes flew to Fuxin and dropped more than twenty bombs, causing heavy losses. (Special dispatch on the 26th) (Beiping) Chengde Telegram: Zhang Zhendong's puppet army fought fiercely with our militia in the Linglong second district near Southern Ling. Our troops in Kailu are concentrated in Siyingzi. Zhang Haipeng's puppet cavalry, five detachments, are advancing towards Kailu. (Special dispatch on the 26th) (Beiping) More than 300 enemy troops were discovered southeast of Mangniuyingzi yesterday, attempting to advance towards Phoenix Mountain. Our army's defenses are very solid. There is busy troop movement of enemy infantry and cavalry on the Beipiao Avenue. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) About 10,000 Japanese infantry and about 5,000 cavalry crossed Laoye Ridge and Lishugou in armored vehicles, attacking our army's positions at Wuzishan and Laoye Temple. Our Liu Xiangjiu brigade responded to the attack. Fierce fighting lasted all day on the 25th, and the Japanese army was repelled. The Japanese army retreated to Mingshuitang to await reinforcements. On the night of the 25th, the Japanese continued to send reinforcements from the Suizhong and Jinxi areas, and immediately launched a fierce attack on Southern Ling. Our army also increased troop deployments to respond. A major battle began this morning at Lishugou Yaowang Temple. (Special dispatch on the 26th) (Beiping) Dong Futing telegraphed Ping this morning, saying that the Southern Ling line is extremely tense, with four brigades of our army deployed. Fierce fighting is still ongoing in Chaoyang. Six Japanese aircraft bombed Chaoyang yesterday afternoon. (Special dispatch on the 26th) (Beiping) Feng Zhanhai returned to Fuxin last night. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Our main force in Kailu is fighting fiercely with the enemy army in Daxingzhala. A part of our reinforcements from Chifeng has made contact with Cui Gong. (Special dispatch on the 26th) (Beiping) The Japanese Army Ministry announced this morning that the Japanese army attacking Rehe encountered strong resistance from the Chinese army in the Baishizu area. (Special dispatch on the 26th) (Beiping) Brigade Commander Dong Futing telegraphed Ping, saying that the Japanese army attacked Chaoyang and dispatched a large number of Japanese aircraft to bomb the city. They dropped incendiary bombs, and four places caught fire. As of noon on the 26th, the city was still burning. (Special dispatch on the 26th) (Beiping) Tang Yulin telegraphed Ping, saying that the main force of the Japanese attack on Chaoyang has moved to the Chaoyang Temple area, attacking Lingyuan from south of Chaoyang Temple via Taipingfang, and advancing towards Jianping from north of Chaoyang Temple via Damiao. The puppet armies of Cheng Guorui and Shao Muliang are still fighting fiercely with our army on the Chaoyang front. (Special dispatch on the 26th) (Beiping) The enemy is transferring troops from Suizhong to Chaoyang, with over 2,000 people being transported every hour, all transported by armored troops and motor troops. A large number of corpses are piled up along the railway in Chaoyang County, and it is impossible to collect them. Zhang Haipeng's puppet command attacking Rehe has transferred three detachments to advance towards Fuxin. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Frontline telegram: The enemy army launched an attack on Chaoyang with tanks on the night of the 25th, but was repelled by our army. On the morning of the 26th, they attacked again under the cover of aircraft, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. There is no change in our defense line. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Fighting broke out in Lingnan County on the morning of the 26th. Teng Guofeng, commander of the Third Route Army of the puppet guerrillas, telegraphed the First Battalion of the First Regiment stationed in Nuan Chih Tang, led by Wen Zuo-chen, with more than 400 men, to go to Chaoyang to fight. The officers and soldiers of the battalion disobeyed orders, and deserted with their weapons on the morning of the 22nd. Wen also fled in fear of punishment. Upon receiving the report, Teng led a guard of more than 400 men from Jinxi County to Chih Chang, Baishi Shuimen and other places on the afternoon of the 22nd to intercept them. The Sixth Route Army of Zhao Da-zhong, stationed in Lishu Gou, was transferred to Jinxi County to defend. The puppet Cui Yao-wu recruited more than a thousand new soldiers in Xinmin County and arrived in Xingcheng County on the 25th, stationed at Xinkaimen. (Special dispatch on the 26th) (Tianjin) Our troops in Chaoyang, Fuxin, Suidong, Kailu and other places have all entered newly constructed defense lines. The fighting in Southern Ling should come to an end soon. This is not the main battle yet. The main battle in the future will be on the line of Lingyuan, Jianping, Chifeng, and Pingquan. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from Suizhong, the Hattori Brigade departed westward from Suizhong this morning.

<p>(Beiping) When someone asked a certain figure in Chinese military circles about the Japanese claim that the Japanese army had occupied Chaoyang, the person replied that this was a trick of the Japanese to exaggerate their victory according to their pre-planned scheme and not according to the true facts.

There have been no follow-up reports since then, because there was nothing to report.

<p>(Nanjing) The Naval Aviation Department was originally located at Hongqiao, Shanghai. It was destroyed by the Japanese pirates' invasion of Shanghai last year and has not been repaired. The Naval Commander Chen Shaokuan, considering that Shanghai is not a suitable place for aviation practice, decided to move the Shanghai Aviation Department to Xiamen. He ordered the department yesterday to handle the completion of all machinery, equipment, documents, and events within a time limit, and wait for orders to send ships to transport them to Xiamen. He also telegraphed the new director Chen Wenlin to select outstanding officers and employees of the department and the previous Xiamen Naval Aviation Department, which was eliminated, to merge and reorganize them and report the results. (Special dispatch on the 26th) (Nanjing) Shen Dexie, Director of the Shanghai Aviation Department of the Navy, submitted his resignation to the Naval Department, saying that since he took over as Director of the Naval Aviation Department in the eighteenth year, he had strived to expand and build the foundation of naval aviation, hoping to strengthen national defense. For three years now, many plans have not been realized. Rather than delaying national defense, it is better to yield to someone more capable. Moreover, Dexie is currently affiliated with the Aviation Agency and has a lot of work to do, so it is difficult to兼顧兼顧 serve as Director of the Naval Aviation Department.

<h3 id="e5">Final Resolution from Guangzhou <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to Washington's expression of willingness to begin negotiations on war debts, as well as the conflict of interests between Britain and Japan in North China, relations between Europe and the United States have clearly become closer. The intricate and complex international political situation is also evidently gradually turning its direction. Under this kind of turning point, the League of Nations has also changed its attitude of maintaining [Japan's Far East policy] for the past two years, and on the 24th of this month, resolutely passed the report drafted by the Committee of Nineteen with a vote of [forty-two to one], giving Japan a stern reprimand and formally denying the [Manchukuo puppet state]. This resolute and stern attitude is truly enough to make the world feel refreshed.</p>
<p>The fundamental reason for the change in the League of Nations' attitude towards Japan still lies in the conflict of interests between the major powers. In other words, the various forms of international politics are actually a manifestation of the [internal contradictions of imperialism]. Therefore, we must not mistakenly believe that [justice has now triumphed over might] in the current international situation, nor should we mistakenly believe that [all the powers are now helping us]. However, if we truly have the determination to fight for national survival, then the current international situation is actually an excellent opportunity for our country to make a final and greatest determination to mobilize ourselves for self-rescue. The tragic struggle in the Rehe region has now begun. Coastal and riverine areas are all uneasy and apprehensive, with the possibility of being attacked and disturbed at any time. Under the current circumstances, our government should show its final and greatest determination and declare to the whole country a consistent policy, so that the people of the whole country can concentrate their strength to support the government. Remembering the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, foreigners said that this war was not a war between [China as a country] and Japan, but a war between [Zhili Province] and Japan. It was not even a war between Zhili Province and Japan, but a war between [Li Hongzhang alone] and Japan. Learning from this past mistake, we are deeply afraid that the tragic struggle in Rehe will eventually end in tragic failure under the enemy's strategy of [divide and conquer], and will ultimately become like the results of the January 28th Shanghai Battle.</p>
<p>This time, Acting Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen and Zhang Xueliang personally went to Rehe to inspect the front lines and boost morale. According to telegram reports, the morale of the frontline soldiers and people has been greatly boosted. This shows that the people of our country today are not a people who are willing to perish. It is only because the previous government was indecisive and unable to decide on war or peace that they wanted to save the country but could not find a way to do so. In his speech at the welcome meeting in Rehe, Song said, [The government will never give up the Northeast, and will never give up Rehe.] He also said, [When a strong robber comes to the door, the only way to survive is to defend ourselves by force.] If Song's firm statement can truly represent the government's attitude, then we dare to ask Chairman Jiang to temporarily entrust his responsibilities in Jiangxi to other senior officials and immediately go to the front lines to appease and encourage the troops. This will not only further boost morale and strengthen their determination to resist Japan, but also the people of the whole country will look up to the banners and cheer and jump for joy to jointly participate in the national revolutionary struggle under this kind of resolute action.</p>
<p>Although the country is in such a critical state, the difference between survival and destruction is imminent. Our people certainly cannot continue to wait passively. Under the current circumstances, we have resolutely determined that struggle is necessary to curb the aggression of Japanese imperialism, struggle is necessary to maintain our own survival, and only by carrying out an anti-Japanese imperialist national revolutionary war can we find a way out for our nation's survival. Therefore, our people today should unite and mobilize, use the power of the masses to strengthen the government's backing, and strengthen the government's will. At the same time, we must also use the power of the masses to enrich the front lines of national struggle. The bloody battle of more than a month on January 28th last year, although extremely glorious and tragic, ultimately relied on the single blow of a Korean to give it a powerful blow. Is it only the people who have lost their country who have suffered great pain, and whose will to resist is more determined and whose actions are more heroic? We earnestly hope that the people of the country will seize the opportunity to save the country before it perishes. Do not wait until the country has perished to try to save it, but there is no way to do so. Today's matter is only about struggle. Let the government awaken, and let the people of the country awaken.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Various Countries Will Implement Economic Sanctions Against Japan <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign news, Japan's rejection of the League of Nations' resolution and its dispatch of troops to attack Rehe actually violate the world's public consensus on peace. In order to prevent the Far East incident from affecting global warfare, if the Japanese army continues to attack Rehe and the scope of the war in North China expands, they will unanimously suspend trade with Japan, first to warn Japan's brutality, second to maintain world justice to help the invaded Chinese nation, and third to benefit their own countries, because Japan's industry and commerce have gradually progressed in recent years, and the industrial goods of major European and American countries have not only seen a decline in those transported to Japan, but even in economically backward countries, those who previously sold large quantities of goods from the United Kingdom and the United States have recently been competed with by Japanese industrial goods, and the number is not small. Therefore, in fact, suspending trade with Japan is also beneficial to the interests of major countries themselves. As for implementing Article 16 of the League of Nations' Covenant to block the Japanese economy, due to the mutual relations between countries, it is still the second step.

<p>The State Department replied to the League of Nations' endorsement of the report</p>
<p>And expressed its participation in the League of Nations Advisory Committee</p>
<p>(Washington) The current U.S. Secretary of State Stimson and the future Secretary of State Hull today discussed all U.S. diplomatic and military affairs, and then the State Department sent a letter to the League of Nations, stating that the United States generally agrees with the League of Nations' conclusions on the Manchuria case. At the same time, Hull also made a brief statement to the public, arguing for the dignity of treaties and expressing his complete agreement with the League of Nations report. Regarding the League of Nations Advisory Committee, it is reported that U.S. Secretary of State Stimson claimed that he now believes that the United States should cooperate with it, and expects that future Secretary of State Hull will also have the same intention, because Hull has stated that he believes that any opportunity for international cooperation to solve important problems should not be missed.</p>
<p>The U.S. government's reply is in response to the League of Nations' invitation to the United States to endorse the views expressed in the report on the Manchuria case and to comply with them jointly. In addition to declaring its support for the League of Nations' conclusions, it also attached advice to China and Japan to resolve disputes peacefully. It first stated that the U.S.'s purpose in the situation arising from the Sino-Japanese dispute is generally consistent with that of the League of Nations, both aiming to maintain peace and resolve international disputes peacefully. In order to achieve this goal, the United States has tried to assist when the League of Nations is exercising its management power over disputes between the two member states, in order to jointly maintain peace. However, at the same time, it reserves the right to make its own decisions regarding methods and scope.</p>
<p>Then, it recounted that the League of Nations, based on the facts of the investigation, made its conclusions into a well-considered explanation, stating that the U.S. government generally agrees with these conclusions, and also said that the U.S. government expresses general agreement with the principles of resolution proposed by the League of Nations, which are in line with the treaties signed by the United States.</p>
<p>Then, it discussed the level of peaceful resolution, with rather euphemistic wording. It is claimed that one is due to the current tension of the situation, and the other is because this letter is actually a statement made by Stimson on behalf of the new government. It said that the two countries currently in dispute have long established friendly relations with the American people. The U.S. government sincerely hopes that both sides will see a way to make their policies conform to the needs and wishes of the League of Nations in view of the world public opinion that has now been clearly expressed, and hopes that disputes between the two countries will not be resolved by any means other than peaceful means.</p>
<p>This letter was drafted by two assistant secretaries of state, Humek and Rogers, with the assistance of Stimson. However, the fact that the League of Nations' invitation can be answered so quickly is enough to show that Roosevelt's attitude is completely the same as that of the Republican government. (National Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After Secretary of State Stimson and Hull discussed, they sent an important official document to the League of Nations regarding the U.S.'s position in the Sino-Japanese dispute, stating that the U.S. government's purpose in this dispute is mostly in line with the League of Nations' purpose, and their common purpose is to maintain peace and resolve international disputes by peaceful means. As for the declaration of the principle of not recognizing [Manchukuo] and the expression of attitude towards this issue, the League of Nations and the United States are in a common position. The U.S. government expresses general agreement with the principles of such suggestions based on the treaties it has signed. (Reuters telegram on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Today, the future U.S. Secretary of State Hull and the current Secretary of State Stimson met, and then told people that the scope of the talks was very broad, which is usually the case during the transition between the old and the new, and said that the opinions of the two were mainly based on compliance with treaties. The United States or any country should not be slack in complying with the words and spirit of treaties and taking care of international credit. Then, it was indicated that the two would meet with British Ambassador Lindsay and French Ambassador Crouta tomorrow, but the issues to be discussed would not be disclosed. According to reporters' exploration from other sources, the Far East situation will probably be discussed together with issues such as war debts and world economic recovery. Hull then stated that he believes that resolving war debts is indeed a definite element in encouraging world recovery, but it is only a part of it. Therefore, the future formal war debt conference is only a part of a large movement in which countries jointly seek economic recovery. He intends to follow a broad policy of international cooperation for all world events, hoping to accelerate the increase in international trade, resolve disputes between countries, and said that he may meet with Stimson every day before the government transition on March 4. (National Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is reported that today, when Secretary of State Stimson and the next Secretary of State Hull held a meeting at the State Department, they have decided to issue a declaration. The declaration is currently being drafted. The general idea is to express cautious approval of the League of Nations' condemnation of Japan's Manchuria policy. The meeting between Stimson and Hull was held after receiving the notification from the League of Nations General Assembly, which stated that the League of Nations had passed a resolution inviting the Soviet Union and the United States to participate in the League of Nations' work to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute. (Reuters telegram on the 25th) (Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the League of Nations Advisory Committee has officially invited the United States and the Soviet Union to participate. The United States believes that the facts and recommendations in the report are in line with the U.S.'s opinions, and that cooperation with the League of Nations is very possible. As for the Soviet Union, it will also take consistent action with the United States. (Central News Agency Telegram on the 26th)</p>

<p>Still Denying the League of Nations' Judgment</p>
<p>Repeatedly Arguing, What Good Is It?</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese representative here published Japan's opinion on the League of Nations General Assembly report. In the conclusion, it denied many of the League of Nations' judgments, such as claiming that Japan did not exceed the scope of self-defense in Manchuria, [Manchukuo] was naturally produced, and Japan had not violated the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, or the Kellogg-Briand Pact, forcefully claiming that Japan had no territorial ambitions in Manchuria, and only wanted to make Manchuria a barrier to communist invasion of the Far East, etc., which is nothing more than deceiving people. In addition, it repeatedly slandered China's disorganization in order to obscure the world. (National telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The main points of the statement submitted by the Japanese government to the League of Nations are as follows:</p>
<p>Part 1: Japan's Cooperation with the League of Nations. Japan has cooperated with the development and success of the League of Nations for more than ten years. China requested the League of Nations Council to deliberate on the Sino-Japanese issue, but the Japanese military action was a self-defense action against the Chinese military attack. The difference in opinion between the League of Nations and Japan occurred because the League of Nations lacked understanding of the Far East. Japan once requested the League of Nations to send an investigation team to understand the true situation of China, but the Committee's report cannot be used as a book sufficient to describe the truth of China. Therefore, Japan submitted a statement of opinion on November 18 last year, but the subsequent organization of the national situation was the organization of the Committee of Nineteen without Japan's consent. Later, in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 2 of the Covenant, it drafted a resolution on reconciliation and the reasons, and Japan requested the deletion of the two sections that did not recognize Manchukuo from the resolution, and at the same time continued to negotiate with the League of Nations and submitted various proposals in order to discover compromise means, but to no avail. The Committee of Nineteen recognized that the third reconciliation was impossible and drafted the fourth report, which was submitted to the General Assembly on February 24 and passed despite Japan's opposition.</p>
<p>Part 2: Errors in the Report. It is a pity that the report uses the Lytton Report as its foundation to review the facts of the dispute. The report recognizes that China's boycott of Japanese goods after September 18 was a means of retaliation, but the matter will definitely have an impact on all countries related to China in the future. Also, the report states that Japan's military action on September 18 cannot be regarded as a self-defense action. The Japanese government denies the resolution that China's boycott of Japanese goods was retaliation. The report also said that the independence of Manchukuo did not occur due to the automatic will of the residents. This is the erroneous conclusion of the Lytton Report.</p>
<p>Part 3: Recommendations That Cannot Be Implemented. (1) When applying the principles of the Covenant and the Paris Treaty to abnormal situations such as China, it is strictly necessary to give it considerable flexibility. (2) The report recommends the withdrawal of the Japanese army, but the stationing of the Japanese army is not contrary to legal principles. The Japanese army is based on the Japan-Manchuria Protocol and has the responsibility to maintain the internal security of [Manchukuo]. (3) Although the report claims that the sovereignty of Manchuria belongs to China, Manchuria has not belonged to Chinese power since 1916. (4) Omitted. (5) The method of establishing a negotiation committee is contrary to Japan's claim that it does not allow any third party to interfere in the Manchuria issue. Therefore, Japan absolutely cannot accept such a proposal.</p>
<p>Part 4: Conclusion. The Japanese government is convinced that the Japanese military actions after September 18 were all within the scope of self-defense, and that [Manchukuo] was established by the automatic will of the residents of Manchuria. Therefore, the Japanese government believes that the actions of its army and the conclusion of the Japan-Manchuria Protocol do not infringe on the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg Pact, the Paris Treaty, or any other international treaty. [Manchukuo] is now promoting rapid development, and foreigners and Manchurian residents are benefiting from it. This proves that Japan's recognition of Manchukuo is a concrete fact that it is the only way to maintain peace in the Far East. (United Press telegram on the 26th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida reported to the cabinet that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can complete the necessary internal steps for Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations within ten days. (Reuters telegram on the 26th) (Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has begun drafting a concrete plan to consult with the Privy Council regarding withdrawal from the League of Nations, which is divided into four parts as follows: (1) The notification to the League of Nations Secretariat regarding withdrawal; (2) The matter of amending the Treaty of Versailles due to the submission of the notification; (3) The obligations that the Japanese government should bear for two years after submitting the notification; (4) The handling of the Disarmament Conference, the Labor Conference, and other international conferences hosted by the League of Nations. Several days are still needed to complete the above four official documents. Therefore, it is estimated that the notification to the League of Nations will be made around March 10 to 15 after the cabinet decides to submit the consultation case to the Privy Council meeting. Also, due to the importance of issues such as the mandated territories, the Labor Conference, and the Economic Conference, the relevant provinces have been ordered to investigate as soon as possible. Some cabinet members advocate that the Labor Conference and the Disarmament Conference should continue to attend from separate standpoints. It is estimated that among the four disarmament representatives, Matsudaira, the ambassador to the UK, will stay until the end to observe the trend of the meeting. The other three representatives, such as Ambassador Sato, and the plenipotentiaries of the Army and Navy, Tatekawa and Nagano, will each return to their posts in their home countries.

<p>Even if Japan Withdraws from the League of Nations, The Hague, the President of the International Court of Justice, Will Still Be Japanese. According to Judge Adachi's interview with Reuters, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations has nothing to do with his position. He also said that the election of judges of the Permanent Court of Justice does not involve nationality issues. Although the United States is not a member of the League of Nations, it has been elected three times. Brazil and Spain have both withdrawn from the League of Nations, but their judges have not resigned, which can be used as a precedent. (Reuters telegram on the 25th)</p>

<p>Rome After Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, what will happen to the islands in the Pacific, north of the equator, that Japan is mandated to govern (i.e., the Marshall Islands and the Caroline Islands)? Today, the organ newspaper of the Pan-German Party published an article discussing this issue, saying that Japan is now controlling the entire Western Pacific, and its situation is sufficient to intercept the sea route between San Francisco, Hawaii, the Philippines, and Shanghai. Therefore, as far as the United States is concerned, it is actually beneficial for Japan to give up the islands. If Japan were to give them up, then these islands could be returned to Germany. [The current situation in the Pacific] is quite unfavorable to the issue of naval disarmament. If the above-mentioned islands are returned to Germany, then a new element will appear in the military status in the Pacific. (Havas telegram on the 25th)</p>

<p>Issuing a Self-Deprecating Lament on Departure</p>
<p>(Paris) Matsuoka Yosuke, the chief representative of Japan at the League of Nations, arrived here at 10:40 last night and will stay for several days before going to London. Other members of the Japanese delegation arrived here this morning. (Havas telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Matsuoka Yosuke, the chief representative of Japan, sent a telegram after leaving Geneva, which was immediately forwarded to the press to explain his feelings of farewell, saying: "When I left Tokyo earlier, I was determined to do my best to explain Japan's claims so that the people of Europe could understand our position and the difficulties we encountered. I wanted to avoid a conflict between the League of Nations and Japan so that Japan could continue to participate in the League of Nations. I was confident that this move was not without hope. Who knew that after March, this hope was completely destroyed. I left with emotions of distress and disappointment. I am not distressed for Japan, but for the League of Nations having made this hasty decision. This will inevitably prove after some time that the League of Nations will suffer more than Japan. I am even more saddened for China, because the actions of the League of Nations will not only fail to resolve the dispute, but will also add a confusing element to the situation in China, and Japan's struggle to stop the unrest will be even more obstructed from now on. I think that the only good thing about this move is that the Japanese people are becoming more and more united, and are more aware of the importance of the current difficult situation and the arduousness of Japan's responsibilities, and are even more determined to restore and maintain the peace and order in the Far East with all their strength. If the actions of the League of Nations can produce this unique effect, then Japan may be grateful to the League of Nations. Although, we still hope that this action of the League of Nations will not widen the divide between the East and the West. As for me personally, I have neither resentment nor fear, so there is no need to waste words. I have always had a hope that Japan will one day be understood by the world. When I leave Geneva, I silently wish that all member states of the League of Nations will be able to obtain enlightenment, and sincerely hope that the efforts of the League of Nations will be successful. What I am comforted by is that the representative of Siam abandoned the voting rights of the sub-resolution. Siam, as a country, is the only Asian country, except for Japan and [Manchukuo], that is truly complete and fully responsible, and has the desire and ability to be independent. As I leave Geneva, I would also like to sincerely thank all member states of the League of Nations for the work they have completed in the past seventeen months, the problems they are facing, and the problems they have encountered in the thirteen years since the League of Nations was established. Their efforts to try to solve the problems are commendable. I would also like to express my gratitude to the city of Geneva and its residents, because the residents of Geneva's style of discussion is deeply felt by the Japanese delegation and me personally." (Havas telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japanese representative Matsuoka told a Reuters reporter before leaving for the Netherlands, referring to the passage of the report and recommendations by the League of Nations, that if I did not have the perseverance of an Oriental, I would definitely cry for it. Future historians will regard the cancellation of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance after the European War as one of the greatest tragedies of our time. He also said that Japan does not want to annex Manchuria. (Reuters telegram on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) On the southeast side of the Japanese garrison in Haiguang Temple, Japanese soldiers, on the avenue from Tianjin to Fengwo, dug bunkers resembling artillery emplacements. Two armed soldiers are stationed there in shifts. At 9 PM on the 25th, two people riding bicycles passed in front of the Zhongyuan Company in the Japanese Concession, and were arrested by Japanese soldiers and taken into the Japanese garrison. Pedestrians, witnessing this, suspected something was amiss and fled in droves. The Japanese police station immediately imposed martial law, which was lifted again at 10 PM. According to information leaked from Japanese residents, the Japanese garrison currently has fifteen tanks and two aircraft. When necessary, plainclothes teams will be unleashed into Chinese territory to create disturbances, and then the intersection of Tonghua Street in the Japanese Concession will be sealed off, and no one will be allowed to retreat back into the Japanese Concession under any circumstances. The Fourth Precinct of the First District and Sixth Precinct of the Public Security Bureau is not far from the Japanese garrison in Haiguang Temple. On the evening of the 24th, five armed Japanese soldiers suddenly attempted to enter the precinct to "inspect." The patrol chief, Zhao Yunpeng, immediately refused, saying there was nothing to see inside. The Japanese soldiers were aggressive and intent on provoking a conflict. Eventually, they were tactfully persuaded to leave by the security team. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese military authorities here are now making every effort to fortify the defenses of the Japanese Concession. All streets and alleys connecting to the concessions are being blocked with barbed wire obstacles, and short walls made of brick and cement are being built in several locations. Thousands of sandbags are currently being filled in preparation for emergencies. All work is being done by Japanese soldiers. Residents in the Chinese-administered area are very apprehensive, but so far, no one has moved into the foreign concessions. (Reuters telegram on the 26th) (Tianjin) According to a telephone call from Tanggu, the Japanese garrison there is digging tunnels inside the barracks, strictly forbidding Chinese people from spying. It is not known where the tunnels lead, but it is speculated that they are heading towards the railway station. The Japanese military in the area has recently stepped up security measures, with many sentries patrolling at night, prohibiting pedestrians, creating a tense situation. Defensive fortifications are being built in many places with sandbags. The transport ship H-ji-ko Maru arrived from Lushun a few days ago carrying a large quantity of military supplies, all of which were rifles and bombs. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

It is estimated that the installation work will take about a month. The previously scheduled date of May 1st for direct traffic may be the date of the trial run after installation is complete.

<p>(Nanjing) Legislative member Liu Guanxun said that the Japanese army has launched a large-scale invasion of Rehe, completely treating us as an enemy country. In order to defend ourselves, our country, in addition to the soldiers on the front lines resolutely resisting, the whole country should unanimously conspire against Japan. The various privileges enjoyed by the Japanese in China, in particular, should be uniformly abolished by the government to clearly delineate the boundaries between the enemy and ourselves. These privileges were originally intended as preferential treatment. Japan has already used airplanes, bombs, and artillery shells to kill and maim our compatriots. Our government still retains preferential treatment for the Japanese in China, which is inappropriate in terms of both sentiment and reason. This matter was recently brought up for discussion at the National Diplomacy Association, and it was decided that it should be presented to the government for adoption and implementation. There are two other things, namely: first, since the front lines are ablaze with gunfire, all cities and ports should immediately stop all entertainment; and second, make efforts to promote donations to support the volunteer army.

Shao believed that his resignation had been approved, and in this time of serious national crisis, the Central Government's promised monthly subsidy of 100,000 yuan for Gansu Province's finances was difficult to fulfill, and it was difficult for him to go to Gansu recently.

<p>President Hoover is Considering It</p>
<p>Washington, 25th (National News Agency) After banks in Maryland closed for three days to prevent a run on deposits, the financial community in Washington was greatly shaken because it is only 40 miles from Baltimore and the banks in the two places are closely related. The Senate and House of Representatives of Congress immediately put Kushner's emergency banking bill on the agenda for discussion, and passed the bill today, authorizing national banks to provide financial assistance to state banks in times of financial emergency. It is currently under consideration by President Hoover. In addition, the Maryland legislature has a bill to limit the amount of withdrawals that bank depositors can make without prior notice, and it is expected that it will also be passed tomorrow. Both of these bills can prevent state banks from declaring another suspension of payments. The power to implement them is now in the hands of the U.S. President and the Governor of Maryland.</p>
<p>Washington, 25th (Reuters) There are over 6,000 banks in the United States, with total deposits of $17,000,000,000. The Senate and House of Representatives have passed a bill granting the Comptroller of the Currency the authority to place limited restrictions on withdrawals. This bill will become law upon presidential approval. This power is granted to the Comptroller of the Currency for a period of six months, which can be extended with the consent of the President and the Secretary of the Treasury. In practice, this bill directly grants temporary emergency powers to the Comptroller of the Currency, but state governments already have this power over state-chartered banks.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 25th – Bavaria is hearing that the central government will send an administrative committee to reside in the province, causing public anxiety. To calm the public, Vice-Chancellor von Papen telegraphed Munich, the capital of the province, stating that the government has no such intention. However, the authorities are currently engaged in prohibiting opposition party election propaganda. Recent actions include forbidding former Chancellor Brüning from making a broadcast election speech. Other opposition party leaders are also subject to this restriction.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 25th – The government is still making every effort to curb the activities of the Communist Party, but has not yet found a reason to declare the party an illegal organization and prevent it from participating in the general election. Today, an order was issued prohibiting the collection of funds for the Communist Party and similar organizations throughout Prussia. Although funds can still be collected as usual in party meetings, this ban greatly hinders the Communist Party's election campaign, as large sums of money are needed during the campaign, relying entirely on donations. Elections will also be held in Prussia on March 5, as the Supreme Court in Leipzig today rejected the former Prussian government's lawsuit against the hasty dissolution of the assembly before a new election date was set.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Chiang Kai-shek Issues Another Order for Fan Xiji to Eliminate Xu and He Bandits <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Xu Bandits Gather in Tongjiang</p>
<p>He Bandits Flee in Disarray to Tianmen</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the Xu bandits fled to northern Sichuan and the He bandits fled to western Hubei, forming two major forces, Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek immediately dispatched He Chengjun as the commander of the suppression campaign and Tian Songyao as the bandit suppression supervisor of the Sichuan-Shaanxi border region to pursue and block the Xu bandits. He also ordered Fan Xiji, the chief of the Hubei Provincial Security Department, to rush to Yichang to supervise the suppression of the He bandits. More than a month has passed since then. According to Tian Songyao’s telegram from Ningqiang on the 23rd, the bandits initially entered Sichuan with only five or six thousand men. In the past two months, they have collected various local bandits in the Sichuan-Shaanxi border area, such as Ren Weizhang, and seized group guns, increasing the number to thirty or forty thousand, with no less than ten thousand guns. They were organized into the pseudo Fourth, Ninth, and Twenty-fifth Armies, and there were also names such as Red Army, Pioneer Corps, Children's Corps, Red Guards, Militia, Guerrilla Squad, and Upper, Middle, and Lower Vanguard Squads. The bandit leaders are Zhang Guotao, the pseudo director of the Northwest Military Affairs of the Chinese Soviet, Xu Xiangqian, the pseudo commander-in-chief and army commander, Kuang Jixun and He Wei, the pseudo director of the General Political Department, Tao Changhao, the pseudo general director, Zhang Qinqiu, and the pseudo political commissars Zhan Fangcai and Gan Yuanjing. They committed arson and murder, showing extreme cruelty. After investigation, Tian's troops, although stronger than the bandits, felt a lack of bullets. The troops of Hu Zongnan and Liu Maoen, who were originally elite and belonged to Shaanxi suppression, were transferred to Gansu, leaving only Liu's troops to enter Sichuan, and the supplies could not be transported. A month ago, Shaanxi sent personnel to escort military rations to Sichuan, which took a month to arrive. The transported rations were eaten up by the transporters, as the road was dangerous and there were no residents. Northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi are the most barren, and there is no food to buy along the way, so they have to fill their stomachs with military rice. Under these circumstances, the bandits were able to expand their strength through intimidation and enticement. Tian Songyao's telegram clearly shows that the situation is becoming increasingly serious. Tian recently sent a representative to Nanchang to meet Chiang Kai-shek and personally present everything. It is heard that Chiang instructed to re-telegraph Tian, instructing him to eliminate the bandits and prevent them from fleeing far away. At the same time, he also ordered Fan Xiji to be responsible for eliminating the He bandits. According to the latest news, Tian's troops have captured Bazhong and are advancing to suppress Tongjiang. Liu Cunhou and Liu Maoen's troops have also advanced to Moshitou, more than ten miles away from Tongjiang, and will launch a joint attack within days. As for the various units of the He bandits, except for a part that remained in Hunan, most of them have returned to the border of Hubei. The county seat of Wufeng was once lost, but the newly appointed county magistrate Sun Bin, specially appointed by the provincial government, telegraphed that he had risked his life to take office, seemingly indicating that the bandits had withdrawn from the county seat and had other plans. The Wang Bingnan unit of the He bandits was defeated by Fan Xiji in Xintang before, and fled to Shiziguan in Xuan'en. After sending teams to pursue and suppress them, they fled to Ximaping in Tianmen. Fan is supervising the troops to encircle and suppress them, and Xu Yuanquan has also sent troops to block them in various places to prevent them from going deep. (February 25)</p>

<p>Xia Doutang, He Jingwu and others Elected as Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hubei Provincial National Air Force Creation Association held its inaugural meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 1:00 PM on the 25th. Leaders from all sectors of the Party, government, military, gentry, business, industry, and academia attended enthusiastically. The presidium of the meeting included Ye Peng, Chen Daxun, He Jingwu, Su Taiyu, Pu Xinya, He Hengfu, Huang Yingzhong, Lou Botang, etc. Ye Peng was publicly elected as the general chairman, and reported the significance of the meeting, briefly stating that in modern scientific progress, the use of air force in war has suddenly increased in importance. Therefore, the outcome depends not on the quantity of the navy and army, but on the strength of the air force. Without an air force, there is no national defense. The Premier had already instructed in the past that, as the national crisis is pressing and the government's finances are difficult, the people should automatically create an air force. Saving the country is saving oneself. The turmoil of the roving bandits in the late Ming Dynasty shows that the wealthy were unwilling to contribute their wealth until the city was breached, but they still could not protect themselves. The image of national subjugation can serve as a warning. Next, He Jingwu, Fang Benren, He Hengfu, Zhou Xingtang, and others gave speeches, all of which were extremely poignant. After the speeches, the Refined Salt Association immediately donated 2,000 yuan on the spot, and the Security Joint Association donated 1,000 yuan. Then, He Jingwu read out the various proposals, which were unanimously passed by the entire audience: (1) The Provincial Air Force Creation Association is established today, with the general headquarters located at the Hankou General Chamber of Commerce. (2) Telegraph all counties and cities in the province and various groups in Wuhan to quickly establish branch associations. (3) Telegraph all provinces in the country to quickly establish National Air Force Creation Associations to unite and resist foreign aggression. (4) Pass the general association constitution. (5) The telegrams that have been sent are approved retroactively. (6) Pass the general meeting declaration and the method of collecting, safekeeping, and using donations. (7) Set the first joint meeting of directors and supervisors for 2:00 PM on the 28th. Forty-nine directors were elected on the spot: Xia Douyin, Ye Peng, Tu Weizeng, Chen Daxun, Lu Deze, Yang Zaichun, Chen Shi, Song Ruhai, Xie Chuheng, Wu Guozhen, Zhao Dianzhi, Li Shucheng, Cai Lisheng, Liu Shaoyan, Fang Benren, Zhao Zhongxuan, Xu Ziqing, Pu Xinya, Wu Xinming, Wang Yiling, Yu Zhonghan, Zhou Cangbai, Zhou Xingtang, He Hengfu, Chen Jingyu, Zhu Songshan, Yu Jusheng, Xiao Dengyun, Li Dezhai, Gao Bochang, Su Taiyu, Zhang Yikun, Yu Yuzhi, Cai Shuzhong, He Jingwu, Huang Yingzhong, Sun Yechao, Lou Botang, Chen Huaping, Qiu Ao, Hu Zhichu, Huang Shaokun, Li Huating, Liao Yaping, Liu Wensong, Li Kaichen, Ye Jiabi.

<h3 id="e66">Financial Crisis in Jinan <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Two Banks Close Down</p>
<p>Deficit of More Than 800,000</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Yijusheng Bank in this city suddenly closed down yesterday (23rd), with a market deficit of more than 300,000, causing a major panic in the financial community. It is currently under investigation. Only one night later, today (24th), Chengdehou Bank also closed down and declared bankruptcy, with an estimated deficit of more than 500,000. The news spread, shaking the entire city. Li Jianquan, the owner of Chengdehou Bank, was originally an unknown salt merchant. During Zhang Zongchang's time in Shandong in the 1920s, Li made a lot of profit by handling Xuan Yong bills and provincial bank bills, and thus became a seemingly wealthy merchant. Chengdehou Bank was established in his home (Xianxue Street). Li had extensive social connections and was lavish in his spending. Banks and silver firms considered him reliable due to his activities and were happy to deal with him. In fact, he did not have much capital. In addition, his salt business suffered many losses, and his extravagant spending gradually led to financial difficulties. Therefore, on the second day after Yijusheng Bank closed down, he declared bankruptcy. It is scheduled to be held at 3:00 PM tomorrow (25th) at his home to host a creditors' meeting to discuss bankruptcy and debt repayment methods. It is heard that his assets are very few, but the total deficit is 500,000 yuan. Those affected include five banks, thirteen silver firms, and ten individuals. Among those already identified are: Continental Bank 110,000 yuan, Shanghai Commercial Bank 60,000 yuan, China Industrial Bank 40,000 yuan, Zhonglu Bank 25,000 yuan, Shandong Commercial Bank 11,000 yuan, Xiejutai Bank 18,000 yuan, Deju 9,000 yuan, Jindaxiang 10,000 yuan, Dadetong 10,000 yuan, Deshengchang 8,000 yuan, and Yuanfengcheng 24,000 yuan.</p>
<p>After the collapse of Yangjusheng, the staff of its Lianhao Yijuzhan also fled. Qingdao Lianhao Yijucheng also collapsed on the same day. It is heard that Qingdao Yijucheng owes people 110,000 yuan and is owed 80,000 yuan. The bank issued a Shanghai exchange for 80,000 yuan. It is heard that after the incident, 50,000 yuan was deducted in Shanghai, but this has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>According to people in the financial community, native products, cotton yarn, and other companies suffered too many losses last year, and this year's market prices have plummeted again and again, with estimated total losses of more than 1 million yuan. If they cannot support it, the entire city's commerce will be at risk of collapse. (February 24)</p>
<p>[P Lu Province Establishes County Administration Construction Experimental Zone</p>
<p>Pilot Project in Zouping and Zou County</p>
<p>Director of the Experimental Department Concurrently Serves as Chief</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Governor of Shandong Province Han Fuqu believes that improving internal affairs and promoting autonomy must start from rural areas, so he pays special attention to rural education and rural construction. He designated Zouping as a model county and hired rural education experts Liang Shuming, Liang Zhonghua, and others to come to Shandong. They established a Rural Construction Research Institute in Zouping, recruited several classes of students, and engaged in research and experimentation. For two years, they have achieved some results, but the scale is still small, not enough to accommodate many people, and sometimes restricted by laws and regulations, they cannot fully experiment. Therefore, they have now changed their approach, expanded it, and made it larger. At today's provincial government standing committee meeting, Han specially proposed the establishment of the Shandong Provincial County Administration Construction Research Institute Experimental Zone, which was passed as proposed. The content is as follows: A temporary report from the Secretariat stated that the Chairman has submitted a copy of the Shandong Provincial County Administration Construction Research Institute Experimental Zone Regulations, the original text is as follows: (1) These Regulations are formulated with reference to the Measures for Establishing County Administration Construction Experimental Zones in Various Counties of the Ministry of Interior Affairs (hereinafter referred to as the previous measures) passed by the Second National Internal Affairs Conference. (2) In accordance with the provisions of Articles 2, 3, and 8 of the previous measures, Zouping and Zou County are temporarily designated as the experimental zone. When necessary, the number of counties may be expanded. One zone chief officer is established to have overall responsibility for all administrative affairs within the experimental zone. (3) In accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of the previous measures, the county government and its affiliated agencies within the experimental zone may be reorganized and expanded as appropriate. (4) The organization of the zone chief officer's office shall be formulated separately in accordance with the provisions of Articles 8 and 10 of the previous measures.

<p>The County Government Recommends Construction Personnel</p>
<p>The County Construction Bureau of this county was ordered to be abolished and transferred to the county government for reception. The county government was received by County Chief Shen, the section chief of the second section, Qian Baotai, and clerks a few days ago. Subsequently, the provincial government issued an order, promulgating the outline of the county government organization, stipulating that the county government should set up a technician's office to take charge of construction matters, and the number of staff members would be determined separately, etc. For the time being, nine staff members, including Mu Tongbo, are temporarily appointed as custodians to be responsible for safekeeping. Now it is learned that the county government has submitted a request to the Construction Department, requesting the appointment of Mu Tongbo as the technical director, Zhao Shuda and Wu Zhaosheng as technicians, Luo Yili as a surveyor, and Ye Jitang as a construction worker, in order to emphasize construction. As soon as the provincial order is approved, they will start work immediately.</p>

<p>New Weights and Measures are Successfully Implemented</p>
<p>Because the local Nandhuo Industry Association was ordered to switch to the municipal scale on March 1, it convened a general meeting of all members on the afternoon of the previous day (25th). Chairman Miao Dongchen reported first, briefly saying that the goods from Shanghai in our industry have all switched to the new scale, but the sales in this county still use the old scale, which has a huge loss. We should quickly switch to the municipal scale in accordance with the order. It was decided that the switch would be implemented on March 1, and all old scales would be handed over to the association for safekeeping. The door-to-door prices would be reduced uniformly, and a list of prices would be recorded separately and sent to each store, which must not be increased or decreased without authorization, so as to ensure fairness. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. The sauce and wine industries will also use measuring instruments from April 1. Inspectors Tang Fuxuan and Qin Hebing have been inspecting the clothing industry for days and found more than 100 old rulers, which were taken back to the county government and confiscated uniformly.</p>

<p>The River North Tong's Fisheries Administration's protection team was abolished by order of the Ministry of Industry. The coastal protection facilities will be handled by the Fisheries Improvement Association.</p>
<p>Jiaxing Four-County Highway Conference Minutes</p>
<p>Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, and Haiyan counties convened a meeting at the Jiaxing County Government on the 25th to discuss the construction of highways. The items for discussion are as follows: The road lines will be built in two phases. The first phase will be at the end of the 22nd year, and the road lines to be built are: (A) Pinghu to Jiashan, (B) Jiashan to Xitang, (C) Xinfeng to Xinhua Shendang. The second phase will be at the end of the 23rd year, and the road lines to be built are: (A) Shendang to Ganpu, (B) Xinhua to Jiashan, (C) Haiyan to Tanghua, (D) Zhapu to Pinghu. The cost is tentatively set at 400,000 yuan, which will be borne by the province and the counties. The 200,000 yuan for the four counties is divided into five shares, and Jiaxing gets two shares, and should pay 80,000 yuan. The money will be allocated from the sale of the city bricks and surplus land from the Shiqiu city wall. If the four counties have difficulty raising funds, they may mortgage the property rights of the entire road to the financial community for cash, or the Highway Bureau may issue stocks and use the revenue of the entire road as a mortgage.</p>
<p>Qingjiang, Qingzhen Small Boats Resume Long Trips</p>
<p>The small boats of the Qingjiang and Qingzhen companies on the inner river have not been running long trips since the Mapengwan blocked the construction of a river dam. Until the dam was released last winter, the river water froze again, so even short trips were stopped. Now that the river water is melting and the water is increasing, two upstream long trips have arrived in the past two days, one is the Chunxian steamboat of the Fuyun Company and the Fuqing tugboat, and the other is the Guangjiang steamboat of the Zhentong Company and the Qingjiang tugboat. Therefore, the various boat companies here have also opened downstream trips from (22nd) onwards, directly reaching Zhenjiang, restoring the old routes before the dam was built.</p>

<h3 id="e69">University Professors' Conference Discusses Ways to Cope with National Crisis <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Xiong Xiling and Wang Renzhi Report on the Situation in North China</p>
<p>All Advocate for Chairman Chiang to Go North to Resist the Enemy</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Professors' Association, in response to the start of the Battle of Rehe, convened a general meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the China Society on Weihaiwei Road. More than 20 people attended, including Wang Zaoshi, Zhu Qinglai, Zuo Shunsheng, Shen Hengshan, Xie Xunchu, Wu Zelin, Yang Weiyu, Peng Jiuying, and Pan Dakui. Mr. Xiong Bing-san and Mr. Huang Renzhi were invited to report on the situation in North China, discuss countermeasures, and re-elect directors. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Xiong Xiling's Report</p>
<p>The meeting began at 3:00 PM, chaired by Wang Zaoshi. He first reported that representatives of professors from universities in Peiping and Tianjin had come south, but had not yet arrived in Shanghai because negotiations in Beijing were not yet complete. Mr. Xiong Bing-san arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Peiping, and the association respectfully invited him to report on the situation in North China. Mr. Xiong stood up and reported that the situation in Rehe was precarious, surrounded by mountains, commanding a high position. Its importance was even greater than that of Peiping and Tianjin. Currently, the battlefields, except for Kailu, which is a plain, are all in towering mountains and steep ridges, such as Lingyuan, Beipiao, and Chaoyangsi, which are easy to defend and difficult to attack. Even Kailu requires traversing sixty li of mountain roads, all narrow paths, truly a situation where "one man guards the pass, and ten thousand cannot pass." Within Rehe, there are more than hundreds of thousands of local militia, with nearly two hundred thousand rifles. The local customs are robust, as it was the imperial hunting ground during the Qing Dynasty, and the residents are accustomed to martial arts. When I (Xiong referring to himself) served as the Governor of Rehe, I trained more than one hundred thousand local militia. Later, when the Feng army was defeated and withdrew from the pass, two divisions of troops were disarmed by the Rehe militia. Therefore, their strength is quite considerable. It will not be easy for the Japanese to invade this area. However, Rehe Province has always been poor. In the past, the central government assisted with hundreds of thousands [of dollars] annually. When Zhang Zuolin became the Grand Marshal, he stopped the subsidies. Subsequently, the local authorities took everything from the people. When Tang Yulin governed the province, the land tax increased to four yuan per mu, and the people's livelihood became difficult. Later, through my efforts and those of General Zhu Ziqiao, we vigorously negotiated with the central government and North China authorities for subsidies, so that Rehe Province could stop collecting the land tax. Fortunately, it was successful, and the people's strength was somewhat relieved. The military deployment is also in place, and the command of the formal army and the volunteer army is also moving towards unification. However, Rehe is barren and the people are poor. In recent months, the volunteer armies from the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang have gathered on the Rehe border, and there is a danger of food shortages. It is hoped that assistance can be provided. The morale of the lower-ranking officers and soldiers in North China is very high. The troops set out as soon as they receive orders, without demanding any expenses for departure. The soldiers expressed that in the current war of resistance against Japan, people from all walks of life come to comfort them, showing the great kindness of the Chinese people. How can we not fight desperately? He also stated that although our army does not have airplanes and artillery, the Japanese cannot occupy our land solely relying on airplanes and artillery. They must use infantry or cavalry to charge before they can occupy our positions. We must vow to hold on to the death, never give up our positions, and not allow the Japanese invaders to cross the Lei Pool one step. The battle of Rehe and eastern Hebei is related to the survival of our country. I hope the whole country will rise up to help, fully supply food and military supplies, and especially hope that Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission will personally go north to supervise the army. Then the victory is in our grasp, etc.</p>
<p>Huang Renzhi's Report</p>
<p>Next, Huang Renzhi, the representative of the Shanghai Local Association who went north, reported that since the September 18th Incident, he had gone north twice, in July of last year and January of this year. His impression was that there were three points: (1) lack of unified command at the front; (2) lack of organization at the rear; (3) lack of financial resources. This month, he and representatives of the Local Association, Mu Ouchou, Hu Yunzhuang, Yang Zhixiong, etc., went north again. Fortunately, Dean Song also arrived in Peiping around the same time. The above three shortcomings began to be addressed one by one, and considerable measures were taken. If Rehe can hold for three months, then the "green screen" will rise, and the Japanese, even with airplanes and other new weapons, will have no way to use their skills. For the sake of reliable security in North China, and for the future of the entire country, I hope that Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission can personally go north to supervise the army.</p>
<p>Passage of Various Resolutions</p>
<p>After the reports by Xiong and Huang, discussions began on countermeasures. Peng Wenyin, Xie Xunchu, Pan Dakui, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhu Qinglai, Zheng Xi, Gu, and others spoke and debated one after another. Then, the following resolutions were passed: (1) Resolution to reward and comfort the frontline soldiers. A: Send a telegram to the frontline to encourage the soldiers. B: Invite Mr. Shen Junru to represent the association and go north to comfort the troops. (2) Send a telegram to the Military Affairs Commission, requesting Chairman Chiang to personally go north to supervise the army. (3) Initiate a fundraising campaign. The procedures and methods will be determined and implemented by the board of directors. (4) Five principles of policy toward Japan were contributed to the government and passed: A: Declare war on Japan. B: Recall the ambassador to Japan and declare a severance of diplomatic relations. C: Order a total political, economic, and military mobilization of the country. D: Launch a counterattack on the three northeastern provinces and Japanese concessions. E: Organize a national volunteer army to conduct guerrilla warfare, and prepare the national combat teams for a long-term war. The five domestic items will be temporarily reserved.</p>
<p>Election of New Directors</p>
<p>After the discussion, the directors were elected by ballot. Yang Weiyu and Zhu Qinglai counted the votes. Wang Zaoshi, Shen Hengshan, Zhu Qinglai, Zuo Shunsheng, Xie Xunchu, Wu Zelin, Zhang Yousan, Zheng Xigu, Jin Tongyin, Chen XuanShan, Yang Weiyu and other eleven people were elected as directors. Peng Wenyin, Pan Dakui, Xie Chengping, Zhang Peijun, Yu Naichuan, and other five people were elected as alternate directors. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Shanghai General Labor Union Issues Letter to Workers Nationwide <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Three Main Points</p>
<p>Save on Food and Clothing to Fully Support Military Supplies</p>
<p>Vigorously Resist Goods and Intensify Anti-Japanese Work</p>
<p>Strive for Production and Implement Labor-Management Cooperation</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Shanghai General Labor Union, in view of the outbreak of the Rehe War and the serious situation, yesterday issued a letter to workers nationwide, stating that the brutal Japanese, disregarding justice and betraying good faith, took advantage of our great flood to seize the three northeastern provinces with lightning speed, and created a puppet organization. In order to respect the League of Nations Covenant and maintain peace in East Asia, we have not hesitated to endure humiliation and repeatedly make concessions. However, the Japanese bandits, like wild boars and long snakes, have endlessly nibbled away at our territory. Recently, after capturing Yuguan, they mobilized a large army to launch a general offensive against Rehe, attempting to fulfill their delusion of swallowing the Northeast and destroying China. Their ferocity and violence have reached their extreme, and their arrogance has reached its limit. Our North China generals, unable to bear it any longer, deeply understand that at this critical moment, there is no way to survive without fighting and no way to save ourselves without sacrificing ourselves. Therefore, they resolutely and decisively sent a telegram, expressing their determination to resist violence and defend the country to the death. Now that the war has broken out, Japan is also tilting its national strength to invade us. The situation is tense and has reached the most serious stage. We must unite as one, exert our efforts to resist the enemy, and save the country from danger and protect the national lineage. The association dares to express its sincere hope and briefly list a few things to tell our most beloved workers nationwide: (1) We should save on food and clothing and do our best to support [军需] the war effort. Defending the homeland and resisting the enemy is the duty of soldiers. Saving on food and clothing, donating money and grain is the obligation of the people. Now that the war has begun, the soldiers at the front have bravely resisted violence and vowed to resist to the death, and the volunteer armies in various places are even more persevering and fighting bloody battles. We, the people in the rear, should prepare grain and supplies, donate money and silk, and fully support them to boost morale and express the people's will. Our national workers have always had extremely ardent patriotic emotions. They should not shirk their responsibility, quickly rise up to provide assistance, so that military strength is strong and morale is high, and it can be expected that the enemy will be wiped out. (2) We should vigorously resist Japanese goods and intensify the anti-Japanese movement. Japan, as a small and poor country, relies on the development of industry and commerce and the sales of inferior goods to us to achieve its current wealth and strength and cultivate its aggressive violence. We must vigorously boycott Japanese goods to strike at its economic lifeline. This task is especially our revolutionary workers' unshirkable responsibility. We deeply hope that workers nationwide will unite, intensify anti-Japanese work, and adopt strict and effective means to carry out an organized boycott movement. Then the Japanese financial stagnation, economic collapse, its desire to engage in further militarism, I am afraid, is also impossible. (3) We should unite and work together to overcome national difficulties. The matter is urgent, the disaster is approaching, the national crisis is serious, and it has reached the final stage. We must gather the entire strength of the country to cope with this critical situation. In addition to doing their best to support the anti-Japanese soldiers and vigorously boycott Japanese goods, the national workers must unite as one, strive to increase production on the one hand, and strive to coordinate labor and management on the other, help each other with sincerity, and work together to resist the enemy. Then, relieving difficulties and saving the country can be expected. The association is not talented, but dares to encourage all workers nationwide.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Support Association Sends Telegram to Encourage North China Generals <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Volunteer Army Support Association, yesterday sent a telegram to various generals in Peiping and Rehe, saying: To Chairman Zhang of Beiping, Chief Staff Officer Wan, Commander-in-Chief Zhang of Rehe, Chairman Tang, and all the generals and soldiers in the Northeast, reading the clever telegram, we are greatly inspired. The Japanese bandits are now trying their best to seize Rehe and peep into North China. At this critical juncture, you are ordered by the central government to actively resist, and the entire army is indignant and righteous. However, the Japanese bandits disregard the League of Nations and throw all their national strength into a desperate gamble. You must have the greatest determination, break the cauldrons and sink the boats, move forward bravely, and disregard your personal lives and seek the survival of the nation and the country. The people of the whole country should unanimously support you. Our association, not considering its limited strength, is more willing to do its best to serve. We send this telegram in reply, eagerly awaiting good news. The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, Chu Huifu Cheng, Li Cishan, Yin Zhufu, Wu Shan, Feng Shaoshan, Yu Huancheng, Yan Zhifang, Chen Ya Fu, respectfully, You,</p>

<p>He Bingxian Talks</p>
<p>The Five-Year Plan as a Model for Our Improvement</p>
<p>Seeking Mutual Sales of Products Between China and Russia</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has consulted with leaders of the Shanghai business and industrial circles to organize a delegation to Russia, with business and industry as the main body, assisted by the government, and is now actively proceeding. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Active Organization</p>
<p>After the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry and Commerce, in order to seek mutual sales of industrial and commercial products between China and Russia, hoped that the national business and industrial circles would initiate the organization of a delegation to Russia. He Bingxian, the Director of the International Trade Bureau, consulted with Zhang Gongquan, Chen Guangfu, and other leaders of the Shanghai business and industrial circles, and they all agreed. They are now actively organizing, with the business and industrial circles as the main body, assisted by the government. The delegation will depart after the organization is completed.</p>
<p>Investigation Mission</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with He Bingxian, the Director of the International Trade Bureau, and asked about the mission of the delegation to Russia. According to him, Russia was originally an agricultural country, but after the success of the Five-Year Industrial Plan, it has been transformed into an industrial country. After the resumption of trade between China and Russia, in order to seek the mutual sales of products between the two countries, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce hopes that our country's business and industrial circles will organize a delegation to Russia to conduct on-site investigations. Moreover, our country is originally an agricultural country and is now actively seeking ways to develop industry. The Ministry's Four-Year Industrial Plan has already begun to be implemented. Therefore, studying the Russian Five-Year Plan can serve as a model for our country's improvement.</p>
<h3 id="e73">The Work and Organization of the Northeastern Association <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Recruitment of Members in Two Weeks</p>
<p>Regular Board Meeting Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Northeastern Association is a successor organization for helping and educating those in the Northeast. Its purpose is to assist the soldiers fighting in the Northeast, investigate the current and past conditions of the three northeastern provinces, study the solution to the Northeast issue, and unite various national organizations to jointly assist in exerting the entire nation's perseverance and determination to seek a solution to the Northeast issue. At the beginning of its establishment, the founders, Wu Tiecheng, Shi Liangcai, and others, clearly declared its purpose. The entire board of directors of the association jointly declared the other day, detailing the purpose of the establishment and the heavy responsibility it bears, in order to awaken the people of the country to unite from top to bottom and carry out the general mobilization of the entire nation to achieve its purpose. A reporter from the Central News Agency, in order to understand the current status of the association's planning and organization, specifically went to the association's executive director, Zang Qifang, and received a detailed answer as follows:</p>
<p>Two Important Tasks</p>
<p>Zang told the reporter, the purpose of the establishment of the Northeastern Association has been described in detail in the declaration published the other day, and the people of the country should have understood it. What we are planning now is the work plan. The most important things are two points: (1) How to enable the volunteer army in the Northeast to fight together with the national army under unified leadership. (2) To investigate the recent situation in the three northeastern provinces and the internal workings of the puppet organization and Japan in order to study the coping strategies. After Ma Zhanshan, Feng Zhanhai, Ding Chao, Li Du and others successively went abroad last year, the spirit of the Northeast Volunteer Army seemed to have declined. However, in reality, there are still no less than 200,000 people in the Northeast who are waiting for orders. However, due to the lack of leadership or the cut-off of supplies, they are hiding in the deep mountains, waiting for opportunities. Moreover, due to the strict investigation by the Japanese military, domestic news cannot be conveyed there. Therefore, although they are ready, they do not yet know that the time to kill the enemy and serve the country has matured. Now the war on the Rehe border has broken out, so it is a good opportunity for the volunteer army to rise up in response to attack from the rear. If the national army in Rehe Province can maintain for three months, then the crushing defeat of Japan should be within expectation. Even if Rehe Province unfortunately falls, the association's support for the volunteer army will not be reduced at all. The effectiveness of the volunteer army fighting within its interior is actually greater than sending troops to recover lost land. Therefore, the association must provide leadership and assistance on the one hand, and transmit all kinds of news to that place on the other hand, so that they can rise up in time.</p>
<p>Recruitment of Members in Two Weeks</p>
<p>Continuing to talk about the recruitment of members, Zang said that the planning of the association will be completed in about two weeks. Therefore, the recruitment period is not too far away. The association is a large group for saving the Northeast and solving the Northeast issue, so we hope that all compatriots nationwide will be members. Mayor Wu once said that the Northeast issue must be deeply imprinted in the minds of compatriots nationwide and alerted at any time and place, that even after the Northeast is recovered, we must not forget the great responsibility of the Northeast's construction. But human life is limited, and the Northeast issue may not be resolved in a short period of time. Therefore, if the Northeastern Association exists, even if it is passed down to our children and grandchildren, it will not forget the Northeast. As for its organization, it must be popularized throughout the country, and branch associations will be established for members in various places. Its internal organization will add several special committees as needed. The Foreign Affairs Committee, which was decided by the last board of directors, is already underway and will conduct detailed investigations and studies on the international issues of the Northeast in the future to contribute to government references. Other committees such as the Economic Committee and the Advisory Committee will also be established in order to study various specialized issues.</p>
<p>Regular Board Meeting Tomorrow</p>
<p>Zang said at the end that the association has scheduled the first regular board meeting for tomorrow (Monday) at 4:30 pm at the Municipal Government to discuss all the proceedings. As for the venue, it was originally intended to be attached to the China Aviation Association, but now because the association's houses are not enough to use, it has been relocated separately and will be moved into the office after repairs.</p>

<p>Tianjin Local Association Standing Committee Member Xiong Xiling, entrusted by the association, has arrived in Shanghai to contact various circles in Shanghai on various issues. The local association, the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, and the Northeast Refugee Relief Association, and other groups, believe that Xiong's trip is particularly related to the anti-Japanese resistance in North China, so they have scheduled a meeting at the China Society on Weihaiwei Road at 3:00 PM this afternoon to welcome him. At the same time, the Volunteer Army Support Association, as Xiong is also one of the directors of the association, will hold the fifth board meeting to allow Xiong to attend and discuss issues such as supporting the volunteer army and assisting the progress of the anti-Japanese resistance in North China.</p>

<p>There used to be a model health district in Wusong Town, which was jointly operated by the Medical School of National Central University and the Municipal Health Bureau. After the January 28th Incident, it was unfortunately suspended. Last year, President Weng Zhilong of Tongji University and Professor Li Xuanguo of the university negotiated with Li Tingan, the Director of the Health Bureau, to resume it and requested assistance from the Health Department. An agreement has been reached and it is said that it can be realized soon. A committee will be set up to take charge of this health district, and the expenses will be shared by the Health Bureau and Tongji University. The Shanghai Lottery Association has allocated 30,000 yuan as temporary expenses for the opening. Once it is restored in the future, the public health of the Wusong area will definitely improve, the health of citizens will be protected, and the students of the Public Health Department of the Medical School of Tongji University will have more places for practice, which is truly a win-win situation.</p>

<p>The Petition Did Not Have Results</p>
<p>The National Postal Workers' General Union of this city convened an emergency meeting a few days ago to discuss the postal unrest in Tianjin and Beiping. Everyone agreed that the peaceful policy has completely failed. In addition to issuing a notice to the postal workers' unions in various places to actively prepare for vigorous preparations, it also sent four representatives, including Zhang Kechang, to Beijing to petition the central government and the Ministry of Communications, hoping to obtain a satisfactory solution. The petition representatives have returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to them, the Ministry of Communications did not give a satisfactory answer to the requests and did not accept the suspension of dispatching the members in Tianjin and Beiping and the cancellation of the demotion punishment. Even the punishment of Ba Lidi and Cao Jianting was not approved. Currently, the emotions of postal workers in various places are agitated and the postal unrest is about to expand.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Strike at the Welfare Rubber Factory Resolved <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Detained Workers Released on Bail by the Municipal Party Department</p>
<p>The entire workforce of the Great China Welfare Rubber Factory in Xingjiazhai, Zhabei, recently organized a labor union and investigated worker names, causing a misunderstanding by the factory. Fourteen workers were detained, leading to a strike. The detained workers have now been released on bail by the Municipal Party Department, and the workers have all resumed work. The following is a record of the events:</p>
<p>The Incident The entire workforce of the factory, in order to organize the Rubber Workers' Union of the Fourth District, had submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department for permission and dispatched Fan Guoren of the Civil Affairs Section as an instructor. In order to clarify the content of the workers, Fan recently sent a letter to the worker Wu Fushou, asking him to investigate the names of all the workers. After receiving the letter, Wu collected all the workers' workbooks to copy the names. The matter was discovered by the factory, which misunderstood that Wu Fushou had other purposes, and then stopped him. Wu then adopted a tough attitude, resulting in a conflict. The police were then called and detained by the First Precinct of the Fifth District. Some unemployed workers, such as Zhu Caixing, gathered workers in a secret meeting in Yuanmaoli, Tiantong Road, that evening. The instructor of the Municipal Party Department found out and reported that the workers were illegally gathering, and then reported it to the Third Precinct of the Fifth District, which dispatched police to detain the workers Zhu Caixing, Qin ChanGen, Li RongYang, Ji Sheng, and other ten people, and sent them to the Zhabei Judicial Section for disposal.</p>
<p>Workers Released on Bail After the workers were detained, the entire workforce declared a strike the next morning and sent representatives to the Municipal Party Department to petition. The day before yesterday, the Municipal Party Department sent Fan Guoren to persuade the workers, instructing them not to be exploited by reactionary elements, and advised them to resume work first. As for the arrested workers, the Municipal Party Department would be responsible for bail. The workers then stated that their actions were indeed wrong, they were willing to repent, and accepted the advice. The Municipal Party Department then notified the Zhabei Judicial Section by telephone to release all the detained workers on bail. All the male and female workers in the factory have resumed work yesterday morning, declaring a solution.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Sun Hegao and Others Preparing to Establish a Copper Rolling Mill <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Former Directors of the Two Railway Bureaus, Sun Hegao, and former Headquarters Chief of Staff Yu Zhongnan, and others believe that various industries are controlled by foreigners, and the required machinery parts are supplied by Japanese merchants, so the rights and interests are lost and the leakage is increasing day by day. Therefore, they are raising huge amounts of money to establish a large-scale copper rolling mill and are hiring Yu Dingming, the former Director of the Taixian Construction Bureau, as an engineer. Since the factory was initiated and prepared, it has been progressing very smoothly and will be officially opened next month. Its name is the China Copper Rolling Mill, and the factory address is on Qu Zhenren Road, Xiejiao, Shanghai, with the office located at No. 4, Niansi Road, Weihaiwei Road, British Concession. It is reported that the main machinery of the factory is custom-made from Germany, so the delivery of goods in the future will definitely be fast and excellent.</p>

<p>Preparing to Develop Chinese Silk Trade in Europe</p>
<p>And Inviting Participation in International Exhibitions</p>
<p>Mr. Zou Zhihua of the Chinese Consulate Office in Lyon, France, yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to investigate the names and addresses of Shanghai silk merchants. The original letter stated, Respectfully, After Zihua was ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to set up an office in Lyon in November last year, it has been actively prepared and has been completed and started working. Lyon is the commercial center of France for the Far East, especially for velvet products. Its international trade relationship with our country is extremely important. Since the establishment of this office, it is planned to first focus on Lyon and prepare for the development of China's silk weaving industry in Europe. However, during the investigation, more actual materials from our country are needed for comparison. Therefore, I specifically ask the President of your esteemed association to lead the group, solicit solid silk merchants in Shanghai who are interested in international trade, and contribute their opinions. There are several items that are requested to be indicated in detail here, listed as follows: (1) Store name and address; (2) Product name in Chinese and English; (3) Samples for exporters must be classified, priced and sent to Lyon; (4) Method of delivery and payment; (5) Other. In March of this year, Lyon routinely holds an international commodity exhibition. If Shanghai's business community intends to participate, then the above items are requested to be actively carried out. Furthermore, please send as much as possible the journals published by the committee on commercial affairs and store them for future reference in case foreign merchants inquire, etc. It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has approved the Business Affairs Section to send personnel to the Silk Factory Industry, Electrical Silk Weaving Industry, and Silk Satin Industry, and other public associations for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e84">County Construction Bureau Abolished <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>County Government Establishes Technical and Health Office</p>
<p>The question of abolishing the Shanghai County Construction Bureau arose because the county government moved to Beiqiao, where construction was heavy. It was once said that the bureau would not be abolished for the time being. Now it is understood that the county government has received a provincial order to abolish the bureau and merge it into the county government. The county will set up a technical office to plan construction matters. It is said that the current director of the bureau, Sun Shengzeng, will still serve as the director of the technical office, and Shi Jingyuan and others will be technicians. The deadline for the merger is March 1st, so Director Sun is currently handling the handover procedures.</p>

<p>Running Away From Home to Join the Army in Shanghai</p>
<p>Jiang Bingqiu, the son of Jiang Maolong, who lives at Malu Bridge outside the West Gate of Songjiang, is fourteen years old and is a student at the local elementary school. Recently, he heard his teacher in school talk about the invasion of the eastern provinces by the violent Japanese, and now they have invaded Rehe again. The situation is becoming increasingly serious. Although Bingqiu is an underage boy, he is extremely indignant. He has twice gone to the local military police camp to request to be enlisted and sent north to fight the enemy. The battalion commander, seeing his youth and bravery, praised him greatly and kindly advised him to serve the country after he has completed his studies. It would not be too late. He then ordered someone to send him home. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 19th of this month, Jiang, together with Meng Guiren (nicknamed Little Girl), the fifteen-year-old son of Meng Tubiao, a carpenter living next door (and a classmate of Jiang), took a fourth-class train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line to Shanghai. Before leaving, they only took two silver dollars. After deducting the fare for the two, they still had a few dimes. However, they had no relatives in Shanghai, and they were lost and confused. They searched everywhere for places to enlist, but after running around for two days, they found nothing. They had no choice but to beg along the way. Later, Lu Xisheng, a native of Songjiang who runs the Yunjian Inn in Yuqing Lane, Xixin Bridge Street, in the French Concession, took them in out of consideration for their fellow hometown relationship. He asked them why they came to Shanghai, and the two students told him the truth. After learning about it, Lu sent a letter to the two students' families, asking them to come to Shanghai to take them back home. After receiving the letter, Jiang and Meng came to Shanghai yesterday to take their children home for a reunion.</p>

Zhao Jinqing presided, Weng Guoxun recorded, and Zhu Guishen prayed. The chairman reported that the country's situation is critical, social morality is deteriorating, and human desires are rampant, the harm of which is immeasurable. The reason for this is that Christians do not emphasize faith and action. Mr. Zhang Zhijiang and others, in view of this, initiated the organization of the Ten-Person Group, hoping to save people and the country. It is expected that all the comrades present will understand this. Now, please ask Mr. Zhang to report on the preparations. Mr. Zhang stood up and said that the purpose of the group's initiation is that we Christians should uphold the spirit of Jesus' love, sacrifice, and fearlessness, promote truth, and jointly face national difficulties, awaken compatriots across the country, and together repent and confess sins before God, reform ourselves, save ourselves and the country, love and help each other, regardless of denomination, cooperate and actively carry out our mission. Preparations and progress in both Beijing and Shanghai have been quite smooth. However, this matter is of great importance and requires the joint responsibility of all comrades present in order to glorify God and save the country from danger. He also suggested that those who have not yet been listed as initiators should all be initiators, which was unanimously approved. It was also decided that the preparatory committee would consist of fifteen people. In addition to the original seven, eight additional people were elected, including Ding Shujing, Lin Hongbing, You Shuxun, Wang Wanbai, Xie Songyang, Shen Weixin, and Zhu Haoran. The election of You Hui was approved. Next, the proposals were discussed: 1. Telegraphing to Christians in countries around the world to pray for our national difficulties, uphold justice, and eliminate the scourge of war. 2. Telegraphing to Chinese Christians at home and abroad to pray for the country, unite and rise up, and jointly seek salvation. 3. Initiate national salvation savings to prepare for relief work. All three proposals were unanimously approved, and it was decided that starting today, for one week, at noon each day, to pray for the country. All churches and believers should participate. Dr. Cheng Jingyi then offered a prayer of blessing, and the meeting adjourned with refreshments. The second preparatory meeting is scheduled for 6:00 PM today at the same location to discuss and decide on the implementation of the proposals.</p>

<p>The Postal Administration submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Communications on the 7th of this month to increase postal rates for letters to Southeast Asia. The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce believes that this move will affect the livelihoods of overseas Chinese and has telegraphed its opposition. The following is an excerpt from the telegram: To Chairman Chen of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee in Nanjing: According to a letter from the Min-Chao Remittance Association, business conditions are extremely bad, and remittances from overseas Chinese have sharply decreased. Family members at home are already suffering. Now, the postal rate for letters is about to increase to one dime and two and a half cents, which is like adding weight to a fish. The more remittances decrease, the more difficult it becomes for families to make a living. We earnestly request that your committee be concerned about the difficulties of overseas Chinese and ask the Ministry of Communications to postpone the increase so that the people can be relieved and have something to rely on for support. Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce respectfully.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Mr. Wu Zhihui's Discussion on the "New Popular Medicine Series" <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Ding Zhongyu from Wuxi, after claiming to have completed the annotation of "Jie Xue Gu Lin," immediately began compiling the "New Popular Medicine Series" with the hope of instilling new medical knowledge into the people of the whole country, thereby strengthening the people and the nation, which would have a great impact. This book is currently being printed and will soon be published. Mr. Wu Zhihui has written a preface to the book, which is very valuable. The excerpt is as follows:</p>
<p>Stubborn me is relatively healthy, so I have lived to sixty-nine years old this year without any major illnesses. I agree with what is said in the "Book of Han" that "if a disease is not treated, it is often cured by traditional Chinese medicine." I have never consulted a doctor for minor colds and fevers. I also believe that some medicines, passed down from my grandmother and others, such as hawthorn ash for diarrhea, fritillaria cirrhosa steamed with snow pear for coughs, etc., work. As suggested by new trends, such as quinine pills for malaria, or swallowing a few Santonin tablets, they often work, so I do not despise Astragalus and Ginseng, serums, or radium tablets. Whether it's traditional Chinese medicine or Western medicine, I only think about the five organs corresponding to the five elements, and removing all my teeth can be a preparation for curing diseases, but I don't have faith in them to that extent. However, to be frank, luckily, Heaven has taken care of me. I have never suffered from typhoid fever or pneumonia, nor have I had carbuncles or boils, so I have not had the opportunity to test the skills of doctors. However, for the prevention of such dangerous diseases, such as fresh air and clean diet, I also believe in making choices when necessary, although I seem to not care. When my appetite is not right for fatty and delicious fish and shellfish or for devouring large portions of fish and meat, I also know to stop eating, although I seem to not be picky about good or bad food. I can try to practice relatively reasonable common sense hygiene, but I haven't researched it in detail. However, I also vomited blood when I was young. I saw in medical books that "if you vomit blood and don't die, you will definitely be scared to death." I closed the book, and I had a sudden realization. Therefore, I immediately acted as if I was already dead, and immediately regulated my diet and sleep, leisurely and content. In the afternoon, I took a walk in the suburbs, looking up at the white snow, stretching across the horizon, opening my mind and chest. Sitting quietly and listening to the sparrows chirping in front of the eaves, it was as beautiful as a sheng and a reed pipe. Haha, in less than twenty days, I nourished myself so that I had a fat head and big ears, and I stopped vomiting blood, and it never happened again. What I find most funny is the so-called "getting rid of the root." Anyone who hopes to get rid of the root of a disease gets flustered and hurriedly calls for a doctor, blaming heaven and cursing the earth, entrusting their life to the doctor (and entrusting their life to the Bodhisattva is even more ridiculous). I don't really agree with this. I sometimes laugh at them for courting death. Therefore, although I don't believe in medicine, and I live a casual life, I unexpectedly use my patience and care to deal with minor illnesses. For example, for tooth medicine, I deliberately ask what is called pain, and consider the degree of pain, seeing how far it goes. I only feel a warm, helpless sensation. Sometimes I can't lift my arm, and I think, why rush to cure it? Let it rest, saving some movement. I believe that using natural therapies may also be helpful. However, in the end, it is still my barbarity. Fortunately, I rely on my relatively strong body, which cannot be considered as valuable experience for others to refer to. However, I have been friends with Mr. Ding Zhongyu for fifty years. We are often shocked by his weak body. We don't say it out loud, but we worry in our hearts that he is definitely not going to live long. In addition, his efforts in learning and handling affairs are extraordinary. Even his earnestness in studying medicine and treating diseases means that he has used medicine to cure many people with weak bodies, which doesn't further deplete his spirit? How is it that he doesn't seem to be doing anything? I think he must be using medicine to treat himself, so he has actually reached the age of sixty, and his body has become stronger. However, I hear that he doesn't easily take medicine, but keeps his mind calm and peaceful, rarely gets angry, and rarely gets impatient. That's why I understand that he really understands natural therapy. I often call his method of maintaining health the "sage's method," and I recommend it to everyone who doesn't understand natural therapy and relies solely on medicine, telling them to learn from it. Now he has selected and introduced various natural therapies such as air, sunlight, diet, and exercise. Only then did I realize that he originally possessed this skill. Although he has a deep understanding of these things, and I only have a superficial understanding, I firmly believe that I am a healthy old man who relies on nature, and he is a healthy and long-lived man who creates his own health. After reading his book, I am even more convinced that I am on the right path. His lamp has guided me, and I can walk more skillfully. Therefore, on the occasion of the publication of the twenty volumes of the "New Popular Medicine Series," I dare to add some nonsense at the beginning of the book, even though I don't understand medicine at all, so that people who are as stubborn as me, and people who are as weak as Mr. Ding, can all refer to it. However, although I firmly believe that diseases need the help of natural therapies, if I contract epidemic diseases or infectious diseases, I also believe that it is absolutely necessary to use medicine for prevention or to consult a doctor, and that one cannot rely solely on natural therapies in such situations. Fortunately, Mr. Ding's book also contains more detailed and concise methods of drug prevention, or advice on how to treat them, for us. This is truly an essential book that everyone should keep with them. Mr. Ding has obtained the secret to longevity and hopes that everyone will live to be eight hundred years old. We should also thank him. Okay, I've said too much nonsense. I'll send it to Mr. Ding for a laugh. February, 22nd year of the Republic of China, Wu Jingheng.</p>

<p>There is a flower association general headquarters with the longest qualifications, located in Sanxin Lane, Dujiazhai, Route Wagner, French Concession. It is said that the flower association was opened by a gambler named Mao. The night before, a bomb was suddenly discovered in the headquarters.

However, the police have already learned about it and are currently conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e94">A Bizarre Case of an Old Man and a Young Girl <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Suspected of Being Sold to Fujian</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 11:00 a.m., police officers Jiang Zhengde and others from the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team were patrolling the river near the Dada Wharf and saw the Wanxiang steamship berthed there, not yet set to sail. They immediately boarded the ship to conduct an inspection. They found an old man in the cabin carrying a young girl, looking flustered and suspicious. When questioned, the two were evasive. They were immediately taken to the team. During the preliminary interrogation by Chief Zhu, the old man stated that his name was Yang Huachen, 55 years old, from Zhejiang. The girl was his niece, and he intended to take her to Fujian to find a relative. When the girl was questioned, she said that her name was Zhu Alin, 16 years old, and the old man was her maternal grandfather. This time, he was taking her to Fujian to find her aunt. Since the statements of the two were completely different, and since there was no reason to take a girl thousands of miles away to find relatives, it was clear that there was a case of trafficking involved. They were ordered to prepare a document and send it to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Swindlers Using Checks as a Tool <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Jiawei and Others Fled</p>
<p>Swindlers Zhang Jiawei, Zheng Hanshan, Xu Xiuzhang, Shen Yunlai, and Wu Wanlong rented a house at 595 Xinzha Road in October of last year, established the Baohua Store, deposited a small amount of money in the World Commerce &amp; Savings Bank, and obtained the bank's checkbook. They then purchased goods from various manufacturers, paying the price with checks. After operating for more than a month, they swindled several thousand dollars worth of goods. When the checks were due, these people, fearing that the scam would be exposed, fled in advance. When the various factories went to the bank to cash the checks, they were unable to do so. When they went to the Shinhua Store to claim payment, the store was already closed, with a sign posted saying "rent due for business failure." Only then did they realize that they had been swindled. At present, the factories that have been swindled, such as Youcheng Silk Factory, Asia Silk Weaving Factory, Zhenhua Umbrella Factory, Huanan Knitting Factory, Yishenghao, Tianhehao, Longchanghao, etc., have hired lawyers to file a criminal self-accusation against the swindlers in the First Special District Court, requesting that they be arrested and investigated and ordered to repay the goods, totaling more than 1,000 yuan. However, the swindlers have already flown away, and it is unknown whether they will be caught in the future.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association, for the case of Wang Weisan, a reporter stationed in Beijing for the Shih Shih Hsin Pao, who was kidnapped and shot by thugs, and who was in dire straits after his death, resolved at an executive committee meeting to send a telegram to the garrison headquarters police department to arrest the murderers, and to send a letter to the Shih Shih Hsin Pao to provide compensation. The association received the newspaper's reply yesterday, stating: "In response to your letter, we have learned that Mr. Wang Weisan, our reporter stationed in Beijing, died unjustly. We are grateful for your concern and high regard. When the incident occurred, our newspaper immediately arranged for the Beijing office to handle all funeral arrangements. Furthermore, Mr. Wang Yingjie, the director of the enemy consulate, personally went to Beijing a few days ago to inform the garrison headquarters to arrest the murderers and bring them to justice in order to comfort his spirit. As for Mr. Wang's family, they have already been compensated in accordance with the company's regulations. Thank you again for your attention. We hereby reply."</p>

<p>許静仁, Chairman of the Shanghai Temporary Relief Association for the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Disaster Areas, along with 張嘯林 and 杜月笙, Directors of the Shanghai China Jockey Club, decided to hold a charity champagne raffle. A special meeting was convened yesterday at 4:00 PM at the逸圍 Greyhound Racing Track, inviting leaders from all sectors to discuss ticket sales. The response was extremely enthusiastic, with 39,400 tickets, more than one-third of the total, being sold on the spot. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Approximately one hundred individuals were present, including 吳鐵城, 戴戟, 熊秉三, 黄涵之, 趙晉卿, 穆藕初, 王曉籟, 虞洽卿, 袁履登, 鄔志豪, 黄伯度, 郭德華, 張竹平, 王彬彥, 劉鴻生, 章行嚴, 應時, 沈錫慶, 文鴻恩, 王一亭, 江一平等.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman 许静仁 opened the meeting with a report on its purpose, stating that it was to organize a charity champagne raffle to raise funds for the disaster areas of Henan and Anhui. He welcomed all those present, noting that they all shared a commitment to charity and relief, and would not hesitate to help those in need. He thanked 张啸林 and 杜月笙 for donating this year's Gold Cup Race to the association. He then gave a brief report on the disaster situation in the three provinces, stating that on October 6th of the previous year, the Relief Committee forwarded a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang, stating that the recovered areas of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei had been devastated for a long time, with widespread suffering, vast numbers of refugees, and widespread devastation. All trees were felled, all houses burned, and even chickens and dogs were not spared. Millions of refugees were left destitute and starving, and the disaster was severe. He requested that funds be raised for relief and that various sectors organize inspection teams to visit the disaster areas for on-site inspections. After deliberation, it was decided to unite all sectors and launch this association, which was established on October 11th at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Fundraising and relief efforts were launched alongside a disaster area inspection, in the hope of doing their best to fulfill their duties. The most severely affected counties in the three provinces, and the areas visited by the association's inspection teams, were reported to those present and are presented below: (A) Severely affected counties in the recovered areas of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei provinces: (1) Henan Province: seven counties: 经扶, 立煌, 商城, 潢川, 光山, 罗山, 信阳; (2) Anhui Province: five counties: 六安, 霍邱, 英山, 霍山, 寿县; (3) Hubei Province: thirteen counties: 黄安, 罗田, 阳新, 沔阳, 潜江, 监利, 汉川, 天门, 应城, 京山, 通山, 厂城, 通城. (B) Organization of the association's inspection teams and locations of their inspections (omitted); (C) Overview of the disaster situation in various counties: (1) 罗田: In areas such as the 阳河 district and the 凤凰山 district, nine out of ten homes were empty, and refugees lacked food and clothing, resulting in a tragic situation; (2) 英山: The county had been a bandit area for a long time and suffered greatly. Most of the houses in the urban area were destroyed, and seven or eight out of ten people fled. People ate grass roots and tree bark to survive, and corpses were piled up everywhere. The Hongshan priest initiated the construction of two white bone towers to bury them; (3) 六安: The disaster situation was particularly severe from the county seat to the 蔴埠 area, with at least one thousand people dead in the least affected areas, and about three to five thousand in the most affected areas. 蔴埠 was in the bandit zone, where over ten thousand people died. The people are now struggling for food, and grain prices have soared. Disaster victims have no clothes to keep warm, and countless people are starving to death; (4) 光山; (5) 经扶; (6) 罗山; (7) 信阳: In the above four counties, houses and farming tools were almost completely destroyed, and hundreds of thousands of people fled. Corpses were everywhere, presenting a terrible sight. It is said that there are two places for burning people, 烧人塲 and 红厂, within 经扶 county, both used for killings, with over 20,000 people killed. 罗山 is suffering from an extreme shortage of grain and clothing, and the sale of sons and daughters is common; (8) 汉川: The county seat was not breached, but the rural areas suffered greatly. The local organization is still good, and there is a Communist Suppression Volunteer Army of 8,100 people; (9) 天门: The areas near 岳口镇 were mostly devastated. The 別家大灣 area was completely burned, a truly tragic sight; (10) 潜江: The area is close to Honghu Lake and is a gateway for the Communists. It has been captured and lost over 20 times, with over 70,000 deaths. Shops have no capital of over 300 yuan, and people still wear single layers of clothing and eat tree bark, making it extremely miserable; (11) 监利: There is not a single copper coin that can be exchanged in the city, the doors are wide open, and many people have fled; (12) 潢川: The county and 焦澤湖 have been lost and regained many times and have suffered particularly severely. Only the elderly and children were seen along the way, with no adult men. Furthermore, there has been no rain for several months, making the situation extremely dire; (13) Other counties: The severity of the disaster situation will be announced later, as the reports have not yet been fully compiled; (D) The urgency of disaster victims awaiting relief: Due to the impact of the current situation, the association has received very little in donations, while the number of disaster victims in the three provinces is huge and in urgent need of relief. Furthermore, groups in the disaster areas of Jiangxi and Shaanxi provinces have requested to join the association and help raise funds. The suffering of the disaster victims is extreme, and the association's resources are stretched thin. If a way is not found to quickly raise large sums of money, it is feared that the surviving people will be beyond help. As the saying goes, "Not saving is certain death, and delayed saving is also death." This would not only fail the expectations of the disaster victims in the three provinces but also go against the initial intentions of the public to do good and provide disaster relief. He respectfully requested that everyone join together to perform this act of kindness, avert this catastrophe, and save the remaining people. He also gave a supplementary report on the overview of the Northeast relief efforts.</p>
<p>Other Reports</p>
<p>(A) Mayor 吴铁城 spoke on the current situation in the disaster areas of the three provinces; (B) 熊秉三 reported on the tragic situation of refugees from the Northeast fleeing to Tianjin and Beijing; (C) 张啸林 reported that relief for refugees could not be delayed and urged all those present to provide as much assistance as possible; (D) 王晓籁 reported on the Gold Cup Race event, stating that there would be a total of 110,000 tickets, with 10,000 tickets being given away as gifts. For every book purchased (10 tickets), one ticket would be given away. Each ticket would be sold for ten yuan, for a total of one million yuan. The first prize would be 420,000 yuan (70%), the second prize would be 120,000 yuan (20%), the third prize would be 60,000 yuan (10%), and small prizes would be 150,000 yuan (20%). The drawing would be held on April 30th in 引翔. These tickets are now on sale. The main sales office is the China Jockey Club on 静安寺 Road, and branch sales offices are at the 申報, 新聞報, 先施, 永安, 新新, and 麗華 companies, for a total of 15 locations.</p>
<p>Number of Tickets Pledged</p>
<p>王彬彦 and others personally carried donation books and asked everyone to sign and pledge the number of tickets they would sell. A total of 39,400 tickets were sold on the spot, accounting for more than one-third of the total. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Proposed Advertisement</p>
<p>A draft advertisement was also prepared on the spot, which will be sent to various newspapers for publication today. The original text stated: "Due to the repeated disasters in the three provinces, the devastation is unbearable to describe. Although the gentlemen and merchants of this port have raised funds for relief, the area is vast and the disaster is severe, making it difficult to provide comprehensive assistance. Therefore, this association, at the request of the Shanghai Temporary Relief Association for the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Disaster Areas, has decided to donate this year's Gold Cup Race to the association so that the income can be used for relief funds, in order to fulfill our limited responsibility. The main points of the arrangements are outlined below for your information. There are 110,000 Gold Cup Champagne Raffle tickets, with 10,000 tickets being given away as gifts. For every book purchased (10 tickets), one ticket will be given away. Each ticket will be sold for ten yuan, for a total of one million yuan. After deducting 250,000 yuan for commissions, all proceeds will be used to expand the relief funds. The remaining amount will be distributed as follows: 420,000 yuan (70%) for the first prize, 120,000 yuan (20%) for the second prize, 60,000 yuan (10%) for the third prize, and 150,000 yuan (20%) for small prizes. The above amounts are based on the premise of selling out all the tickets. The drawing will be held on April 30th at the racecourse of this association in 引翔. Tickets are now on sale. Please purchase them from this association at No. 770 静安寺 Road, or send a postal money order. You will be saving disaster victims, increasing wealth, and seizing a good opportunity. Signed, 张啸林 and 杜月笙, Directors of the Shanghai China Jockey Club."</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 1:45 PM, Vietnamese Constable No. 427 of the麦兰 police station in the French Concession, while investigating two women riding together in a rickshaw, tried to inspect their passes. A dispute arose with the rickshaw puller, 沈芳荣, and the passengers, 解莲贞 and 张凤英. In the ensuing altercation, a Cantonese man, 朱固廷, who was walking by, was shot and killed on the spot. 刘福高, 赵长兴, and 徐林生 were also wounded in the abdomen and arms. The responsible police station took the Vietnamese constable, the rickshaw puller, and Ms. 徐 into custody for investigation. The injured 刘 and 赵 were sent to仁濟 and 廣慈 hospitals for treatment. 徐 went to seek medical attention herself. Zhu's body was taken to the 同仁輔元 sub-hall for examination. 刘 also died. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has been learned that 刘福高 died at 11:53 PM last night. The hospital notified the police station to take the body to the coroner's office. Yesterday, the Second Special District Court was notified, and Prosecutor 邓葆蓀, along with forensic doctor姜 and clerk 卢世臣, arrived at noon for the inspection. The French police station also sent a Western detective and a doctor from the 工部局 to the scene. The bodies were inspected according to the law, and the case was heard. Zhu's family, 朱固海, reported that his brother, 朱固廷, had been tragically shot and killed and requested justice. As no relatives of Liu were present, the official ordered the inspection to confirm that 朱固廷 and 刘 had died from gunshot wounds. 朱's body was allowed to be claimed by his brother for burial. Liu's body was photographed and buried by the 同仁輔元堂, awaiting family claim. It is reported that the families of the deceased have reported the information to their fellow-villagers associations and requested assistance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai was very concerned after learning of the death of their fellow villager, 刘福高. In addition to sending personnel to the Chaozhou Native Association in Shanghai to inquire about the handling of the death of the Cantonese man, 朱国廷, they also sent a letter to the Police Department of the French Municipal Council and the Second District Court of the Special Zone, urging them to punish the culprit and provide compensation according to law. The letter stated, "Respectfully, according to my fellow villager, 刘庆来, his nephew, 刘福高, a native of Cixi, 39 years old, was working as a warehouseman in the Yuan Tai Heng sugar store on 洋行街. On the afternoon of the 25th of this month, he was passing by 新桥街 in the French Concession when an Annamite constable inexplicably opened fire and shot 福高 in the abdomen. He immediately fell to the ground, unconscious, and was taken to the 仁濟 Hospital, where he died around 12 o'clock that night. Qinglai was shocked and went to see him, but it was too late. However, his nephew, 福高, came from a poor family, with an elderly mother over sixty years old and a wife and children below, crying for food. This unexpected disaster has left them without a way to live. Therefore, we earnestly request assistance to comfort the wronged soul." It is our belief that the Vietnamese constable opened fire in a busy street during the day, killing and injuring many people, which is a blatant disregard for human life. Based on the above, we urgently request your director (court) to punish him according to law and provide appropriate compensation to comfort the bereaved family."</p>

<h3 id="e99">Autopsy Required to Investigate Abortion Issue <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Husband Unaware of Wife's Abortion</p>
<p>Neighboring Woman Testifies to Deceased's Statement</p>
<p>A Russian woman named 阿納司旦雪印諾開締納恊可寗 (translated name), 29 years old, whose husband, 恊可寗, is an employee of the Shanghai Power Company, residing at No. 47 Tangshan Road, became pregnant four months ago. On January 7th of this year, due to her aversion to childbirth, she went to a Russian midwife in 茂海 Road to have an abortion. The midwife performed the procedure at that time. Since then, the woman experienced heavy bleeding in her lower body and difficulty walking. Her husband noticed that his wife's condition was worsening and sent her to 宏恩 and 公濟 hospitals for treatment, but to no avail. She died at around 10 AM on the day before yesterday. The hospital reported the case to the 汇山 police station, which sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the斐伦 Road morgue. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court was notified, and Prosecutor 郭炜 arrived to inspect the body and hear the case. A Russian woman named 司各立, residing at No. 31 Tangshan Road, testified that she had visited the deceased's home a few days ago and was told that she had had an abortion in early January and had been bleeding ever since, and had not left the house since then. The deceased's husband, 協可寗, testified that the deceased was his wife. She did not explain this to me at first. Later, I went to the hospital and questioned her repeatedly, and she finally admitted to having had an abortion and said that she had no money to bury her. Based on the testimonies, Mr. Guo stated that it was not yet certain that the deceased had died from the abortion and that an autopsy was required to determine the truth. He ordered that an autopsy be performed and that the hearing be postponed to next Tuesday. The body was handed over to the Health Department of the 工部局 for preservation.</p>

<p>Resisting the Monopoly of Foreign Shipping Companies</p>
<p>Last year, when the Sichuan war broke out, large quantities of piece goods and cotton yarn ordered in Chongqing and 泸州 and other ports were suspended from shipment and accumulated in Shanghai. As the river water receded, the goods were still not shipped. Recently, the Sichuanese merchants, due to the end of the war and the gradual increase in water upstream, and fearing that the Yangtze River transportation might be disrupted, wired Shanghai to rush the goods. This has led to a trend of foreign shipping companies competing to monopolize transportation and Chinese shipping companies uniting to resist. A summary of the situation is reported below:</p>
<h3 id="e101">Foreign Ships Compete for Navigation <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Due to the Sichuan war last year, a large amount of cargo was blocked in Shanghai, mostly foreign cloth and cotton yarn. Recently, the Sichuanese merchants repeatedly wired Shanghai to ship the goods to prevent disruption of the Yangtze River transportation. These yarns and cloths are transported by two routes: one is direct Shanghai to Chongqing ships, and the other is Shanghai to Yichang ships, which are then transferred to Chongqing. The foreign merchants specializing in the Sichuan River shipping route in Shanghai are the Jardine River Company, which has a total of twelve ships operating, followed by 太古怡和, which also has more than ten ships. Currently, Jardine is competing to carry the direct Chongqing cargo, and 太古怡和 is dividing the Yichang transfer cargo. The competition is now underway.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Water Freight Increases <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The main cargo for Sichuan River transportation is cotton yarn. In previous years, foreign shipping companies drastically reduced freight rates to as low as six taels of silver per piece in the shortest time to defeat the Chinese shipping companies, causing many small Sichuan River shipping companies to suspend operations. Seeing the success of the price reduction strategy, the foreign merchants gradually increased freight rates again in the autumn and winter of last year. The cotton yarn water freight rate rose from six taels to eight taels, then from eight taels to ten taels, and then from ten taels to twelve taels, more than doubling it. Special water freight rates are required during shallow water periods.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Chinese Ships Unite <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Last year, seven or eight small Sichuan River shipping companies were squeezed out by foreign ships and went bankrupt. At that time, the Chinese merchant Minsheng Company raised capital and bought up all the suspended ships, with the idea of consolidating the fragmented forces and preventing the Sichuan River navigation rights from falling completely into the hands of foreigners. The Minsheng Shipping Company suddenly rose and also launched Shanghai-Chongqing, Shanghai-Yichang, Hankou-Yichang, and 泸州 routes with more than ten ships, such as the Minquan and Minzhu, to compete with Jardine and other foreign merchants. This time, the Sichuanese merchants rushed to load the accumulated cargo, and the foreign ships took the opportunity to increase freight rates. Minsheng Company joined forces with 招商, 三北, 永兴, 浹江渝 and other Chinese shipping companies to form the Great Alliance of Chinese River Steamers to gather strength and regain navigation rights.</p>
<p>The company will break the foreign ships' monopoly and has decided to reduce freight rates for all goods shipped from Shanghai to various parts of Sichuan from March 1st. It has also notified the Sichuanese merchants in Shanghai. Yesterday, the foreign shipping companies in the port received an urgent telegram from Yichang reporting that the Great Unity of Chinese Ships has been established and is completely aimed at resisting foreign merchants. They should jointly discuss ways to salvage the situation. The foreign merchants who received the news are also secretly discussing countermeasures.</p>

<p>At 7:35 PM last night, a young woman suddenly jumped into the lake at the Nine-Bend Bridge in the lake-center pavilion of the City God Temple in the Nanshi district. Fortunately, a nearby police officer spotted her and managed to rescue her. However, she had been in the water for quite some time and had swallowed too much water, rendering her unconscious. The woman was wearing a dark blue patterned wool cheongsam and cotton trousers. Her shoes were missing. Her hairstyle was a half-modern style, indicating that she was a semi-modern young woman. She was immediately taken to the Second Precinct of the First District. After questioning her in detail, the precinct chief found that the woman did not utter a word. She was first sent to the Shanghai Hospital. She regained consciousness this morning and, after further questioning, revealed some of the facts. She claimed that she was 26 years old and married a man surnamed Bao at the age of 22. Bao died shortly after due to illness. She then cohabited with a man surnamed Zhao, who was a merchant selling opium. Zhao had an 18-year-old younger brother who was fond of wandering. This spring, he even joined a gang of bandits and committed robbery in the French Concession. Zhao's brother was arrested. Unexpectedly, he intended to falsely accuse her (the young woman claimed). Her home was searched by the police station and was left empty, and her cohabiting partner also disappeared. Because she had become homeless, she had the idea of suicide. Director Liu, according to the report, immediately prepared a document to submit it for further judicial interrogation.</p>
<p>Fire Alarm on Avenue Joffre Last Night</p>
<p>At 10:09 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out on the upper floor of the Zhou Xiexiang tobacco and paper shop at No. 90 Avenue Joffre, at the intersection of Avenue Foch in the French Concession. Due to the old nature of the surrounding buildings, which were easily combustible, the fire quickly spread to No. 88, a cross-street building in Taiping Lane to the left, No. 86, the facade of the Qingzhen religious hall, and the entire building of No. 92, the 道生印尉所, and No. 94, the 正大橡皮店, to the right. After the fire department drove to the scene and made strenuous efforts to extinguish the fire, it was not extinguished until 11:35 PM. A total of four buildings were destroyed.</p>

After the incident, an examination revealed that gold jewelry, furs, and approximately 400 yuan in cash were stolen. The owner filed a report with the Fourth District Headquarters requesting investigation and arrest.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Bigamy or Treating Both Wives Equally <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Officials Urge Husband to Treat Both Wives Equally</p>
<p>Ordering Xie Yuchun to Support Liu Lanying</p>
<p>Liu Lanying, a young woman from Wuxi, recently hired lawyer Xu Lin to apply for mediation with the local court mediation office regarding her husband, Xie Yuchun (i.e., Xu Yuchun), who abandoned her and is demanding payment of 3,000 yuan in alimony. Briefly, because the defendant sent someone to marry Ms. Wang as his wife on October 14th of last year. When the petitioner married into the family, the defendant claimed that his previous wife had died and treated the petitioner as an equal wife, treating her as a servant, etc. Yesterday, Wang Shicheng was appointed to open the court for trial. The petitioner, Liu Lanying, testified to the previous situation. When asked, the defendant Xie Yuchun, who is 34 years old, from Wuxi, and lives at No. 17 Xinfeng Lane, Menghua Street, inside the West Gate, replied that he works as a newspaper vendor. Because my original wife was ill and could not have children, through someone's introduction, the petitioner had nowhere to go, so she was brought by Yuan Lai and lived together. Not long after, my wife died of illness. Because the petitioner could not manage the household affairs, I married Ms. Wang to fill the position. The petitioner's bedroom is in the pavilion, and she must sleep until ten o'clock every day before getting up, and often finds fault, placing her clothes elsewhere. Now I have no money, and even if I did, it would be difficult to agree. The official said that she is still a member of the family, and you must treat her equally. The official then attempted to reconcile both parties in court. As a result, in addition to the man being responsible for the petitioner's food, clothing, and housing, she will also receive a monthly allowance of two yuan for pocket money and continue to live together. There must be no abusive behavior. A reconciliation was reached, and both parties signed and left the court.</p>

<p>Numbered with a common opening meeting, and publicly announced by the Public Security Bureau, it is known that there are many suspects and counter-revolutionary propaganda materials have been obtained.

<p>Work and Love</p>
<p>丨丨Reply to Mr. Wei Ying丨丨</p>
<p>Answer: I have read your letter and will reply briefly as follows: (1) Apprenticeship problem. You have many contradictions in your view of apprenticeship: First, you say: "I [feel that being an apprentice, except for being] scolded by the master and suffering physical losses, my spirit is extremely happy." This is probably a kind of politeness and not a heartfelt statement, because you "[think that] doing work [is] not a long-term plan." Isn't this a contradiction? Second, if a person is beaten and scolded, their spirit is still extremely happy. I am afraid that this is not the case. What exactly are you happy about? Isn't this a contradiction? Third, if you say you are willing to be an apprentice, but you hope to be promoted to an employee every day, isn't this a contradiction? Fourth, you say: "[Muddy gray face, oil-stained clothes...a typical example of Chinese life]," in fact, this cannot be regarded as a typical example of Chinese life. Workers in developed countries around the world are all like this. Can you rely on your muddy gray face and oil-stained clothes alone to "[keep pace with the great powers]?" This statement is also unclear. If it is said that China's future depends on the muddy gray faces and oil-stained clothes of these people taking on the burden, this is correct, but the purpose of this burden is not to "[keep pace with the great powers]." On the contrary, it is to overthrow the social factors that cause this keeping pace, because keeping pace means competing for leadership, means fighting for hegemony, and means the evil manifestation of imperialism's plunder and exploitation of colonies. Since you are willing to be a worker, but you are still dreaming the imperialist dream, isn't this a contradiction? (2) Marriage problem. You are in love with the daughter of your former store owner, so problems will naturally arise: First, you are an apprentice, and he is the store owner; second, he has money, and you are a poor boy. This is not only an ordinary problem of status, but a very serious problem of wealth and poverty. The urgent problem to be solved in front of you is this: do you climb to his position to reach up to him? Or does he give up and sweep away everything to descend to your position, willing to share the hardships with you? If he comes to condescend to you, that is something we should praise. If you abandon the apprentice society and the worker society in which you live in order to pursue your lover, then you are also limited. In our opinion, the only thing that can be done today is this: (1) You wholeheartedly do your apprenticeship, and then become an independent worker. You must seek common welfare for the masses of your "[muddy gray face, oil-stained clothes]" society. If you "[look at that mountain and think] that mountain is higher," and you want to be promoted to an employee or become a boss all day long, then you are wrong. (2) Write a frank and open letter to your boss's daughter, clearly telling him that you are now an apprentice and that your future life will only be the life of a worker. If she is willing to always love you, then she can only give up her status as the store owner's daughter to live with you, a gray-faced brother. Otherwise, break up with him and go your own way in life. In the society of muddy gray faces and oil-stained clothes, you can find a lover with a muddy gray face and oil-stained clothes. Such lovers have equal status, the same interests, and can naturally enjoy the joy of harmonious love. If you do not give up, and you must "[a toad wants to eat swan meat]," then you are just asking for trouble. Even if you desperately fly into the sky and eat swan meat, you will fall down and break your legs and bones, and ruin your life! Honest words are offensive to the ear. I know that my humble opinion cannot be accepted by you, but other than this, we have no other good plan to offer. I hope you will think twice.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Donations to Universities in Beiping and Tianjin <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>丨20% to be used for anti-Japanese expenses</p>
<p>(Beiping, 26th) Regarding the issue of anti-Japanese donations from universities in Beiping and Tianjin, the Salvation Federation has passed a resolution to donate 20% of the academy's operating expenses for anti-Japanese expenses and has sent representatives to negotiate with various colleges and universities, which is gradually making progress. Xu Songming said that there are no problems with anti-Japanese donations from various colleges and universities. Jiang Menglin said that the professors at Peking University have not yet reached a consensus on anti-Japanese donations and will decide after he has smoothed things out. The Peking University Academic Affairs Committee decided to donate 5% of their monthly salary from January to March, for a total of three months. If necessary, the amount and time of the donation can be increased. Yang Likui, a standing committee member of the Education Federation, said that he advocates that professors donate one month's salary, because the peasants in the front line are still donating three or four yuan per person and donating rice for large carts for transportation. They are a hundred times more bitter than professors. Central figures who usually eat well and wear good clothes and sit in luxury cars should donate more enthusiastically.</p>

<p>(Qingjiangpu, 26th) At the plenary session of the Huaiyin Normal School staff on the afternoon of the 26th, a proposal was made to suggest that the provincial education federation donate salaries to purchase airplanes to resist Japan and save the country. The result was extraordinarily satisfactory.</p>

<p>Since the Huaiyin Education Bureau was ordered to close, it has been handling the handover procedures in preparation for sending it to the Third Section of the County Government for acceptance. The other day, Director Sun first opened a list of miscellaneous items and utensils in the bureau and sent it to the section, which was checked and accepted by Section Members Qi Ming and Li Shulun. As for documents, seals, etc., they are also being rushed to be processed. Regarding the issue of the bureau's location, there are now two parties requesting the county to allocate it for use, one is the Kangshi Building Girls' Primary School, and the other is the County Education Association. Both parties have submitted a request to the county government for approval.</p>

<p>If American Indemnity Payments are Stopped Again, the School Will Inevitably Shut Down</p>
<p>Students Will Hold a General Meeting to Support the Principal</p>
<p>The China Education and Culture Foundation Will Also do Everything Possible to Maintain it</p>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) The funding for National Tsinghua University has always been sufficient. When the national universities in Beiping and Tianjin were in financial straits, only Tsinghua University, which was far away from the city of Beiping, still had magnificent and luxurious school buildings, and various buildings were being added as much as possible, because the school's funding was entirely allocated from the American Boxer Indemnity refunds, and was not affected by the Russian Boxer Indemnity like other national universities. However, last year, the Japanese robbed the Northeast customs duties, and the Ministry of Finance announced that it would suspend the American and British Boxer Indemnity payments for one year starting in March. This was the first time that Tsinghua University's funding was affected by the situation. Later, after the school principal Mei Yiqi went to Beijing several times to negotiate, the Ministry of Finance finally approved a loan of one million yuan to the school during the suspension period to provide some assistance. Recently, acting Premier Song Ziwen, due to the impending national crisis, urgently needs funds, and plans to suspend the American, British, and Italian Boxer Indemnity payments for another year. He also has concerns about the impact of American Indemnity payments on education and cultural groups. This is the second time that Tsinghua University's funding has been affected by the situation. The following is a record of the situation of the school and the China Education and Culture Foundation regarding the current funding problem.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Remarks by President Mei of Tsinghua University <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Tsinghua University relies entirely on the American Boxer Indemnity refund for its funding. Now, the American Boxer Indemnity refund is about to be suspended for another year, and Tsinghua's foundation is likely to be shaken. On the 22nd, a reporter made a special trip to Tsinghua Garden to interview President Mei Yi-qi and inquire about the financial situation. The following is a record of Mei's remarks: Reports stating that the school's funding is still sustainable are inaccurate. Since the suspension of the Boxer Indemnity refund in March of last year, the school has felt the pain of the funding source being cut off. Subsequently, with the government's permission, 125,000 yuan was allocated monthly from July of last year to February of this year for subsidies. However, the school's annual operating expenses require 1.2 million yuan, and the expenses for students studying in the United States require over 700,000 yuan annually. Furthermore, with the addition of the School of Engineering and a sharp increase in the number of faculty and students, there is an urgent need to add a great deal of equipment. A subsidy of one million yuan is truly insufficient. However, given the critical situation during the Shanghai war last year, we had no choice but to endure it for the time being. On the one hand, we appropriately halted several construction projects and used part of the construction funds to subsidize school expenses. On the other hand, we tried our best to economize, postponing anything that could be delayed. Over the past year, the school has been struggling financially. In the past two months, the situation has become even more difficult. We have tried to negotiate extensions for many payments due, hoping to pay them after the funding increases in March. Maintaining daily expenses has already necessitated borrowing from banks. Recently, I read in the newspaper that the Boxer Indemnity refund is about to be suspended again. If this is true, then the school will inevitably be brought to a standstill, because the situation this year is very different from last year. Therefore, the faculty and students of the school are extremely uneasy. A few days ago, I accompanied Mr. Ren Hongjun, the secretary-general of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, to Peiping to request an audience with Minister Song, but we were unable to meet him due to unforeseen circumstances. We still do not know the true situation or whether it has been confirmed. However, I believe that during this time of national crisis, the government's finances are certainly difficult. While the amount of the American Boxer Indemnity refund is relatively small in the government's revenue and expenditure, it is crucial for the maintenance of this school and the China Foundation. In the coming year, in addition to the school's regular expenses of 1.2 million yuan and the American expenses of over 700,000 yuan, the equipment for the two new departments of electrical and mechanical engineering, which the school is adding in accordance with the government's directive to develop science and engineering, will cost at least 2 million yuan, which is still far from enough. If the suspension is actually implemented, and only the remaining funds that should be used as a foundation are taken by the government, it may not provide much assistance to the government, but it will have a great impact on the school's repeated exhortations to students to study diligently and strive to serve the country. Moreover, if the precedent of suspending payments is opened again and again, and if it continues, the foundation of the school will be shaken, and it will be difficult to maintain it in the future, let alone develop it and achieve success. Furthermore, yesterday's newspaper reported Minister Song's remarks that, in any case, the educational expenses of Peiping and Tianjin would not be affected, which shows that the government attaches importance to education and considers it a major national plan, which is in line with our views. Although the school has not yet made many contributions in academics, judging by its equipment and achievements, it is still one of the better universities in the country. The government should not be biased and allow it to come to a standstill. Even if the Boxer Indemnity refund is not suspended, the funds for March will not be received until April, so there will be no way to manage next month. We will have to find a way to borrow. In short, the proposal to suspend the American Boxer Indemnity refund again will not provide much assistance to the country, but it will greatly harm the school. I hope that it will not become a reality, so that the studies of more than 900 young people in the school can be spared from suspension, the 80 or 90 students studying in the United States will not be stranded overseas, university education will not be affected, and the foundation of the country will not be shaken, which would be a great fortune.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Opinions of Tsinghua Student Representatives <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The reporter interviewed Shang Chuandao, the representative of the Tsinghua University Student Union, and asked about the students' attitude towards the funding problem. His answer was as follows: Unfortunately, our school suffered the suspension of the American Boxer Indemnity refund for one year last year. Thanks to President Mei's trip to the capital for negotiations and the students' efforts as a backing, the Ministry of Finance allocated a loan of one million yuan during the suspension period. Unexpectedly, the American Boxer Indemnity refund is about to be suspended again this year, which is an unfortunate situation for our school. In the spring of last year, Tsinghua, in order to add the School of Engineering and departments such as electrical and mechanical engineering, requested the government to approve the allocation of all the American Boxer Indemnity refunds due to our school in the final year of the fiscal year (i.e., from January to June of the 21st year of the Republic) as school expenses, which was approved by the government. Subsequently, due to the Japanese seizure of Northeast tariffs, the Ministry of Finance suddenly announced the suspension of the American Boxer Indemnity refund for one year from March, causing Tsinghua University, which was in the process of expansion, to suddenly feel an economic panic. Although the Ministry of Finance allocated a loan of one million yuan afterwards, it was far from the school's original funding, which was two million yuan. Only after adopting reduction measures could we barely survive the difficult situation. The last time the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture held a regular meeting in Shanghai, this issue was discussed, and Director Ren Hongjun contacted the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance, but without results. Now, President Song has announced the suspension of the American Boxer Indemnity refund for another year, and our school's future is in great danger. The students are considering this difficult problem. For the sake of the studies of all students, we must not allow the suspension of the American Boxer Indemnity refund again. If Tsinghua's funding has problems again, then the addition of courses and departments will be greatly hindered. Not only will the students at Tsinghua be sacrificed in their studies, but the graduate students studying overseas will have no way to make a living. Tsinghua's funding has always been allocated monthly by the customs from the American Boxer Indemnity refund to the American Embassy as a procedure for returning the Boxer Indemnity, and then the American Embassy handed it over to the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, and then the Foundation divided the funds into three parts, one part for the use of students studying in the United States, one part for Tsinghua's regular expenses, and another part for Tsinghua's foundation. Although our school has a foundation, no one can use it. Last year, during the suspension of the American Boxer Indemnity refund, it was stipulated that the American Boxer Indemnity refund would be delayed for one year. The American Boxer Indemnity refund was originally scheduled to be paid off in the 29th year of the Republic, but it was postponed for one year to the end of the 30th year of the Republic. Now there is news of another one-year suspension of the American Boxer Indemnity refund. Whether it will continue to be postponed for another year will be known after President Mei contacts the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance. In the future, after the American Boxer Indemnity refund is paid off, Tsinghua's funding will completely depend on the interest of the foundation, so the foundation must never be used and must be preserved properly, because the government has no special [funds] allocated to Tsinghua's funding. At present, the students are temporarily silent, waiting for the government to see if there is a solution for Tsinghua's funding after the continued suspension of the American Boxer Indemnity refund, and waiting for President Mei to contact the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance first. All the students pledge to be a backing, and when necessary, convene a general assembly to discuss detailed measures, the purpose of which is to prevent Tsinghua University from closing its doors.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Cultural Institutions in Peiping Affected <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The reporter learned that in addition to Tsinghua University, the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture was also greatly affected by the suspension of the American Boxer Indemnity refund. He specially interviewed Yu Shangchen, the secretary of the Foundation, who said the following: I also learned from the newspaper that the American Boxer Indemnity refund would be suspended for another year. The exact news will have to wait until the end of April, because that is when the customs surplus period is. Looking back at the suspension of the Boxer Indemnity refund last year, the subsidies for cultural and educational institutions in Peiping were maintained by the Ministry of Finance borrowing one million to maintain the status quo. This amount also included a small amount of foreign debt, which was barely enough to pay. Therefore, the subsidies for existing cultural institutions were greatly reduced, and new establishments requesting subsidies were not approved. Among them, although there were many well-run institutions that should have been subsidized, we wanted to support them as much as possible, but due to financial constraints, we had to cut them off. The Foundation manages subsidies for cultural institutions in Peiping, amounting to about 3 million yuan. Tsinghua's 2 million yuan is also handled by the Foundation. If the American Boxer Indemnity refund is suspended again this year, not only will the status quo not be maintained, but also the foreign debt borrowed last year and the increase in the foundation will be difficult to find other ways. Institutions such as the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute and the National Peiping Library are medium-sized cultural institutions that receive subsidies from the Foundation. Therefore, last year, due to the lack of funds for purchasing books, valuable books that should have been collected were lost abroad, which is a great pity. As for the Foundation's annual meeting, it is held once a year in July, and the location is decided by the Standing Committee. The Standing Committee discussed the location of this year's annual meeting in January, and due to the current situation, it is planned to be determined according to the situation at that time. This is also a special situation this year.</p>

<p>Over 500 Attendees Including Party and Government Representatives, Teachers, and Students</p>
<p>Chairman Pan Gongzhan Reports on the Situation of Civilian Supplementary Schools</p>
<p>The eighth session of the Municipal Public Schools and the fifth session of the supplementary schools organized by the Municipal Bureau of Education were held yesterday at 2:00 PM at the Municipal Public Education Center. Those in attendance included Mayor Wu's representative, Zhang Yuanruo, representative of the Municipal Party Department, Huang Shaoxiong, representative of the Municipal Health Bureau, Xu Xingjia, Director of the Bureau of Education, Pan Gongzhan, Section Chief Chen Bai, Commissioner Zhang Yongchun, Director of the Public Education Center, Yang Peiwen, and over 500 teachers and students from public schools and supplementary schools. Chairman Pan, the Director of the Bureau of Education, performed the ceremony as scheduled. First, the chairman reported, saying roughly that the meaning of opening public schools and supplementary schools is probably understood by everyone, because the general public has exceeded the age of education and has not been able to study, and some have not been able to study due to family relations. We run these schools to provide learning opportunities for the general out-of-school public, at least to give them a kind of general knowledge. This session of public schools runs a total of 35 schools, with a total funding of 3,474 yuan, an average of 100 yuan for each school. There are a total of 1,697 students, and 384 graduates have been reported, but the exact number is more than that. The average cost per student is 2 yuan. From the first session to the eighth session, the total funding is 37,273 yuan, the total number of students is 13,578, and the total number of graduates (not including the eighth session) is 7,099. There have been five sessions of supplementary schools, with a total of 5,908 students and a total funding of 23,265 yuan, with an average cost per student of 4 yuan. In the future, we hope that the education funding will increase, and we are more willing to expand these schools. At the same time, we hope that private individuals or organizations will work hard to promote them, so that the number of literate citizens will increase day by day. As for the graduates, they should bear the responsibility of advising and guiding. We sincerely hope that these schools will develop day by day and that the public's reading will increase day by day. Next, Mayor Wu's representative Zhang Yuanruo, representative of the Municipal Party Department Huang Shaoxiong, representative of the Health Bureau Xu Xingjia, and Commissioner of the Municipal Bureau of Education Zhang Yongchun gave consecutive speeches, and the graduates' representative gave a reply speech. Director Pan then distributed souvenirs, and the ceremony ended.</p>

<p>Germany's Poor Economy, Hitler Opposes Holding Games in Germany</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Mussolini Has Agreed to Host</p>
<p>(Rome Correspondence) At last year's 10th World Games held in Los Angeles, USA, the Olympic Committee resolved that the next games would be held in Berlin, Germany, in 1936. The German committee members also accepted this proposal. However, at that time, Hitler, the leader of the German National Socialist Party, declared that if he were to lead the German cabinet, he would oppose the next games being hosted by the Germans because the unstable German national economy could not afford such waste. At that time, the Los Angeles newspapers reported this news one after another, and the sports circles of various countries felt extremely uneasy. Recently, Hitler was indeed appointed Prime Minister of the German Cabinet. A month ago, he made a statement to reporters from the German Nazi Daily, saying that he was determined to oppose the next games being held in Germany. Count Razi Ruber, Chairman of the Olympic Committee, was extremely worried when he heard the news. He believed that Italy and Japan were currently competing to host the 12th Games. Since the 11th Games could not be held in Germany, it would be better to move the next games to Italy and formally decide that the 12th Games would be hosted by Japan. Razi Ruber personally visited Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for this matter, and Mussolini agreed to host the next games. Therefore, it is now rumored in Europe that the next games will be held in Rome instead of Berlin.</p>

<p>Liangjiang Refuses White Nat as Referee</p>
<p>Before going abroad, the Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team held friendly practice matches with various strong teams from Western expatriate communities. Although they suffered minor setbacks twice, the team members remained in high spirits and continued to work hard without giving way, because their goal was to seek improvement in experience and skills, and the team did not care about winning or losing. Liangjiang has participated in the Xiqing Championship for four years and has never had any problems. Therefore, the Xiqing authorities strongly praised them, especially since Liangjiang has won the championship in the past two years. All Western women's teams also admire them very much, so the relationship between them is very harmonious. This competition is purely for friendly practice. However, Liangjiang authorities believe that the referee White Nat, who refereed the previous two games, lacked fairness and has officially sent a letter to Xiqing refusing White Nat as a referee. It is reported that Liangjiang will have a third friendly match with the Green Team tonight. It is expected that there will be a fierce battle, because the Green Team is the A team of the Rowing Club. It is difficult to predict who will win. It is hoped that Liangjiang will be careful in their efforts to regain victory.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Shanghai Small Talk <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— T. G.</p>
<p>Small talk is intended to be different from the idle chatter of Hu Yan. In fact, small talk is just idle chatter. Because I'm afraid someone will misunderstand me or have the ambition to imply [literary archetype], so it's better to call it "small talk."</p>
<p>According to old Shanghai locals who are familiar with local customs, once you wear a [otter fur coat] with Chinese dress or a [tuxedo] with Western dress, you don't take rickshaws anymore. This is naturally related to status and face.</p>
<p>Therefore, not wearing an otter fur coat and taking a rickshaw is obviously a bit out of place, especially on Nanjing Road. Because rickshaws are not allowed on the tram tracks on that most refined street of Shanghai, and can only go close to the sidewalk.</p>
<p>If we're ranking things, if a rickshaw is considered a third-class vehicle, then the taxi of a bill broker probably only deserves to be labeled as [unclassifiable]. It doesn't dare to imitate cars and trams and gallop on the wide road, nor is it patient enough to slowly walk along with the rickshaws following pedestrians. The shouts and yells constantly give the rickshaw pullers a kind of mental disturbance and threat. Unfortunately, I can't represent the rickshaw pullers, and sometimes I really want to turn around and say: "Are you in a hurry? If you're so capable, go run in the middle of the road!"</p>
<p>To avoid the crowding on the trams, I actually subscribed to a monthly rickshaw in the morning (which of course can't be said to be bourgeois). Whenever the hot white foam from the horse's mouth splashed on my collar, I seemed to smell a fishy and rotten stench and couldn't help but curse. At the same time, it makes me miss the sculling boats of my hometown very much. Although it is very small, it can leisurely row in the middle of the river without being interfered with by the river police. As for the mood of listening to the rustling sound of rain on the awning in the cabin, it's something that Shanghai people who are stuck in a cage-like rickshaw canopy can't even dream of!</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Law of the Jungle <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>Righting wrongs when seeing injustice and drawing a sword to help—if these two phrases haven't yet become antiques in the [Chinese Cultural Museum] and are only worthy of admiration and praise, then Da Erwen's theory of the law of the jungle isn't worth burning by Qin Shi Huang. It can only be put together with scrap metal and sold as waste by the pound. Don't believe it? Look at the facts.</p>
<p>Hooligans—or "green skins" as they're called in the north—harassing decent women on the street. Readers, unless you've never left your house, you've probably seen it once or twice in this smoky society. So, let's use this as an example.</p>
<p>A nice lady walks alone on the street, and a green skin spots her and follows her, talking nonsense and even groping her. If the lady is timid, she'll just let the green skin harass her, taking two steps at a time, her face red and her head lowered, trying to avoid him. Then, not only will the green skin get his way, but even the well-mannered bystanders will crane their necks and applaud. But if the lady isn't easy to mess with and grabs the green skin by the collar after he lets out a fart and slaps him twice, then someone will immediately come to mediate and perhaps the police will even arrest the green skin and bring him to justice.</p>
<p>Japan has bullied China enough. After taking away the Northeast provinces, China simply didn't resist. It was like a rare and pleasing woman letting the green skin harass her. Who saw anyone righting wrongs and drawing a sword to help? When the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army resisted in Shanghai, just like the lady raising her eyebrows and widening her eyes, look, the ministers and consuls of various countries rushed to mediate. Trenches have already been dug in Rehe, preparing to fight the enemy to the death, and the League of Nations' condition is improving day by day, much stronger than before.</p>
<p>In this world, you can only avoid being bullied if you are strong yourself. If you're like A Dou, just hoping that someone will right wrongs and draw a sword to help, humph, forget about it.</p>

<p>— Tu Hongxia</p>
<p>[Chinese Women, Please Look at Yourselves]</p>
<p>(1) Mrs. Matsuoka</p>
<p>Many days ago, the newspaper reported: [When Matsuoka left the country to go to Geneva, his old mother personally gave him a Japanese sword and instructed him to fight for the country, saying that if diplomacy failed at the League of Nations, he could commit suicide with the sword to show the spirit of the Yamato people.] Matsuoka took the sword and ran to Geneva. Seeing that Japanese diplomacy was in a stalemate, Matsuoka often sighed when he saw the sword given by his mother every time he returned to his residence. This sword is indeed valuable. It's both tragic and fervent, and especially we Chinese people who are afraid of death should emulate it.</p>
<p>In China, when a child is born, they are all regarded as their own source of wealth, a money tree. As long as this child grows up, is able to flatter, brag, and be corrupt, and knows how to make money, parents will definitely smile. No matter what society is like? What is the country like? This Mrs. Matsuoka takes her son's life and death very lightly and regards the country and the nation as important. In the vastness of China, I'm afraid you won't be able to find even half a person even if you wear out your iron shoes.</p>
<p>If the mothers of China give each of their children a sharp Chinese sword and instruct them: [If you don't kill your enemies, wash away the disgrace, and recover the] lost territory, then commit suicide with the sword and never come home again.]</p>
<p>If we can do that, China is guaranteed not to perish!</p>
<p>(2) Mrs. Noriko</p>
<p>Today, especially in the deformed society of China, it is really as rare as [phoenix feathers and unicorn horns] to find a woman who is truly virtuous and can help her husband succeed in his studies. Unexpectedly, in the three-island Japan! There is actually a Mrs. Noriko who stands out from the crowd.</p>
<p>Because her husband was working as a teaching assistant in economics at Kyoto Imperial University, burying himself in research all day long without producing anything, Mrs. Noriko secretly practiced driving a car and obtained a driver's license. She worked as a chauffeur during the day to make a living and took care of household chores at night so that her husband could concentrate on his studies. This is a commendable thing.</p>
<p>How dignified and happy is the wife of a university professor? How humble and painful is a chauffeur? However, in the eyes of this virtuous Mrs. Noriko, nothing is dignified, and nothing is happy. Only her husband's academic success is the most dignified and happiest thing. Alas! In the vast land of China, where can we find a second Mrs. Noriko?</p>
<h3 id="e147">Jade and Women <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Miaoshen</p>
<p>In our country's writing, jade has always been used to represent women. For example, [jade person] refers to a beautiful woman; for example, (jade appearance) refers to a woman's beauty. It can be seen that the meaning of the word jade is not only a metaphor for women, but also a metaphor for beautiful women. And women, not only regard themselves as jade, but also claim everything, such as [jade skin], [jade wrist], [jade thighs], [jade legs], everything on a woman's body is like jade. And they befriend jade, regard jade as the ultimate treasure, and wear jade on their bodies and on their heads. If jade had knowledge, it could be called infinite blessing! If jade didn't have the need of women, I'm afraid its value today would be little different from bricks and stones. So jade is not precious without women; women are not beautiful without jade! Therefore, a libertine in later generations defined it by saying: Jade is a woman, and a woman is jade.</p>
<p>From the dictionary, we can find that the ancient writing of the word [play] is [妧]. Someone asked: Why did the [妧] character change to the [play] character? There is also a meaning to this: because although women's rights in our country were not developed in the past, the heart of worshiping women was no less than that of modern people. Their reason was: How can a woman be played with by you? If you want to play, go play with jade! Therefore, the character [妧], which has a female radical, was changed to [play], which has a jade radical. It's a pity that the general public doesn't understand the original intention of this character-creating gentleman and still compares jade to women, endlessly entangled with what is beautiful jade and what is a beautiful woman. This is too ungrateful to the painstakingly transformed [play] character.</p>

<h3 id="e148">The Landlord <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Good! Good, Brother Zhang!" Every blood vessel in the landlord's body was swelling, almost bursting. "Now, please take our Lao Liu and Lao Qi out to inform the residents of the village, and tell them to escape as soon as possible. If anyone is willing to stay here and fight to the death with the Japanese, please move into the manor and lie in ambush in the woods to guard it. Those who are unwilling should not be forced!"</p>
<p>The three people left like whirlwinds.</p>
<p>"Be careful! Be prepared!" The landlord, with his knife held horizontally, saw a group of spirited young people already lying in ambush in the woods, rubbing their fists and preparing to defend when his old partner carried him out of the manor. These were all [militia farmers] that he had trained over the years.</p>
<p>After the news that the landlord had ordered everyone to escape spread, the whole village knew that their lives were in danger. The situation was immediately chaotic. Men, women, old, young, who didn't want to escape? People flowed westward like a tide. Cries and shouts echoed the sounds of fighting in the distance. Chickens and dogs were also flying and running wildly in the streets. A total of fourteen people were willing to stay here, including one woman and one patient.</p>
<p>The patient was Brother Zhao. After sending his wife and children out of the village, he leaned on a crutch and slowly limped into the manor.</p>
<p>"Brother Zhao! What are you staying here for? Why don't you escape early?" Someone next to him asked.</p>
<p>"Although I can't go to battle, I can cook for you and do my best!" A hearty smile floated on Brother Zhao's golden face. "It turns out that the person who cooks can also go out to fight!"</p>
<p>"Brother Zhao is right!" Everyone was moved by him.</p>
<p>"Auntie! Why don't you leave?" Xiao Ling asked the woman very sincerely. The woman was the landlord's daughter, who was already a widow.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about! How could the landlord's daughter be willing to escape with others!" Auntie walked into the house as calmly as if she didn't know there were Japanese invaders coming, and her pace was as calm and slow as usual.</p>
<p>Brother Zhao and Auntie's encouragement gave everyone ten times more courage, and they held their weapons especially forcefully, quietly waiting for the time of bloody battle to come. The people in the village had all left, but there was still no news of the victory or defeat on the front line. "Xiao Ling! Do you hear how the shouts are getting closer?" The speaker was Xiao He, Xiao Ling's cousin.</p>
<p>Xiao Ling responded with silence. (5)</p>
<h3 id="e149">The Voice of National Salvation: My Personal View on Saving the Nation Through Aviation <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Having read the *Shenbao* from February 15th of this year, the Aviation Association has organized two hundred fundraising teams, aiming to raise two million yuan in membership fees. The cost of purchasing aircraft, according to Mayor Wu's reply to the Chinese Women's Temperance Union, is approximately between one hundred thousand and one hundred fifty thousand per plane. According to Mr. Lin Wojiang, Japan currently has one thousand five hundred to one thousand six hundred aircraft, so we should have at least one thousand. Therefore, the cost of purchasing planes would require two hundred million yuan. The Association's fundraising only covers one percent of the required funds. However, I believe that everyone possesses a heart for national salvation. If four hundred million people each contribute half a yuan, even the poorest beggar, earning only one copper coin a day, could fulfill their responsibility in just a few months. As for those unable to contribute, such as infants in swaddling clothes, someone must bear the associated responsibility, so there is no need to worry about their inability to contribute. For example, the head of an eight-person household should contribute four yuan, fulfilling their due obligation. Those with greater means can contribute several times that amount, based on their conscience and willingness, without facing difficulties. As for the payment method, it would be best if the government immediately printed a batch of aviation savings certificates, imitating postage stamps, divided into denominations of half a yuan, five yuan, and fifty yuan. These should be distributed to post offices across the country and sold like postage stamps. People could deposit aviation national salvation savings at any post office or mailbox, receiving a certificate equivalent to the amount deposited for verification purposes. Simultaneously, postmen could serve as volunteer fundraisers, carrying these certificates while delivering mail to conveniently solicit donations. They would submit their collections to the post office daily, ensuring success and quick results along their routes. Those who have fulfilled this obligation can affix the certificate to their door or in a visible place, demonstrating their patriotism and fostering a sense of glory. Since the anniversary of the January 28th Incident, the public is generally aware of the necessity of saving the nation through aviation. However, there are several concerns among the public: Some believe that such national salvation donations have been launched many times, but few have yielded satisfactory results, leading to a cold attitude. Others wonder where these donations will ultimately go and whether they will materialize into tangible results, causing them to hesitate. Some are ashamed of their limited ability to contribute significantly, thinking their small contributions are insignificant. Still others believe that there are too many fundraisers who frequently visit their homes, with no clear standards, leading to misunderstandings and suspicions. In my humble opinion, all of these concerns can be addressed. If the public knows the required contribution is only half a yuan per person, and those who can afford to contribute for ten, a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand people are likely to do so, and those who have not fulfilled their share will feel ashamed and strive to meet their obligations. Even if parents have already fulfilled their children's share, the children may voluntarily save money from candy and toys to purchase national salvation certificates, demonstrating their ability to contribute. I expect the post offices to be as crowded as the roads of Shanyin, collecting and remitting funds every ten days, reaching a considerable sum. If it is announced to the public within a month that a hundred aircraft have been purchased, it will inspire many to enthusiastically contribute, and those with extra resources will volunteer to donate again, without needing further solicitation. If someone affixes this certificate to a black armband to commemorate the September 18th Incident, I believe it will create a stronger impression than giving speeches, as all acts of awakening operate in this way. As for aviation mail, it can also be utilized accordingly. Defensive measures are like training soldiers for a thousand days to use them at a critical moment. In ancient times, soldiers were integrated with farmers; why can't we integrate anti-aircraft fighters into the postal service today? I sincerely hope that our government will consider my humble suggestions and implement them resolutely!</p>

<p>In addition to the aforementioned public and private hospitals, there are also clinics that call themselves hospitals but cannot accommodate patients, easily causing misunderstandings in society and providing opportunities for unscrupulous doctors to deceive people for profit. I would like to take this opportunity to clarify: The term "hospital" is not originally a Chinese term. The name "Tai Hospital" (a collection of imperial physicians) was used during the monarchical era. Since it was used to translate the Western word "Hospital," the narrow interpretation in people's minds seems to be a place that accommodates patients for treatment and recovery. However, government officials have not explicitly stipulated the qualifications for a hospital or stated that the name cannot be misused. As the saying goes, "If the name is not correct, the words will not ring true," and thus disputes arise.</p>
<p>Many doctors hang a "hospital" sign outside their personal clinics, either calling it "So-and-So Hospital" or choosing names like "Ankang Boji," but in reality, they cannot accommodate a single inpatient. In particular, general practitioners take advantage of the notion that "hospitals have greater prestige than individual practitioners" and collectively hang up hospital signs. As a result, the glass windows on Fourth Avenue are filled with the words "hospital," and the advertisement columns in newspapers are filled with hospital names. The most ridiculous thing is to borrow the name of a well-known hospital elsewhere as a way to attract customers. For example, there is a Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing that covers hundreds of acres, and there is also a "Peking Union Medical College Hospital" in Shanghai that occupies two rooms. There is a Guangji Hospital in Hangzhou that is built on mountains and rivers, and there is also a "Guangji Hospital" on a corner in Shanghai. There is a Gospel Hospital in Suzhou with beautiful scenery, and there is also a "Gospel Hospital" in Shanghai with brilliant electric lights. Not only is it written clearly in Chinese characters, but also a Western-language banner is added, and the prices for each department are marked on the wall so that potential patients can understand at a glance, truly making a fool of ourselves in front of foreigners and creating a spectacle in society. However, there is also a basis for some of our new medical practitioners to call clinics hospitals. According to Japanese custom, a place where a doctor practices individually is called a "hospital," and a place that accommodates inpatients is called a "sanatorium." Therefore, hospitals such as "Shimizu" and "Shinozaki" in the Hongkou area do not necessarily accept inpatients, and the fact that Fumin Hospital does not call itself a sanatorium has already accommodated Chinese customs. In this anti-Japanese trend, I want to advise my colleagues not to use Japanese customs as a basis for calling clinics hospitals, so as not to disrupt our already "agreed-upon name."</p>
<p>However, people in society have changed their previous understanding of hospitals because of this confusion in the medical community. I am often asked during social gatherings, and I have heard other doctors being asked the same question: "I have heard a lot about you! Where is your big doctor's hospital?" It seems that a doctor must have a hospital, and only those with a hospital are big doctors. Therefore, I advocate that in the near future, the Health Bureau, the Medical Association, and other organizations should work together with the concession authorities to investigate the public and private hospitals in Shanghai, indicating the chief physician, the departments of diagnosis and treatment, the number of beds, the level of service, and the fees charged. A large-scale disclosure in the newspapers can analyze the public's perception and facilitate patients in choosing the appropriate medical care, which is not a small matter.</p>

<p>(10) Method for Estimating the Date of Childbirth</p>
<p>Calculate from the first day of the last menstrual period to 280 days, which is the estimated date of childbirth. The calculation method is to add seven days to the first day of the last menstrual period and add nine months to the month number, or subtract three months from it, which is the estimated date of childbirth:</p>
<p>(1) Assuming the first day of the last menstrual period is September 21st:</p>
<p>Day Day Day</p>
<p>21 + 7 = 28, i.e., June 28th</p>
<p>Month Month Month</p>
<p>9 - 3 = 6, which is the estimated date of childbirth</p>
<p>(2) Assuming the first day of the last menstrual period is January 5th:</p>
<p>Day Day Day</p>
<p>5 + 7 = 12, i.e., October 12th</p>
<p>Month Month Month</p>
<p>1 + 9 = 10, which is the estimated date of childbirth</p>
<p>This calculation method is simple and clear, and everyone can easily calculate it.</p>
<p>There is also a prediction table, which is quite simple. The table is as follows:</p>
<p>This table is based on the date of the last menstrual period. Add the corresponding number in the table to get the result.</p>
<p>For example, if the last menstrual period was January 20th, then the predicted delivery date is October 27th. If the last menstrual period was December 1st, then the predicted delivery date is September 7th of the following year, and so on.</p>
<p>(11) Childbirth (Labor)</p>
<p>Childbirth is the expulsion of the fetus and its appendages from the pregnant woman, commonly known as labor. Generally, 280 days is considered the normal period of childbirth. During this period, there is a force of expulsion that allows the fetus to be delivered naturally and causes the uterus to contract, also known as the force of delivery, which is labor pain, abdominal pressure, vaginal wall, pelvic floor, round ligaments, and fallopian tube muscles, all of which contract.</p>
<p>(A) Labor Pain</p>
<p>Labor pain is the periodic contraction of the uterus during childbirth, causing pain, hence the name labor pain.</p>
<p>Labor pain is the beginning of childbirth and promotes the process of childbirth. It can cause the separation and expulsion of the ovum, facilitating childbirth.</p>
<p>Premonitory labor pain is the slight uterine contraction that often occurs near the end of pregnancy, called premonitory labor pain. Primiparas (women giving birth for the first time) often experience a sense of tension or slight pain during premonitory labor pain, but multiparas (women giving birth for the second time or more) often have no pain. In premonitory labor pain, it occurs only once or twice at first, and as the time of delivery approaches, the number of labor pains increases, but the onset and interval are generally not very uniform, and the contraction force is very weak. If the labor pain intensifies, it is often mistaken for the beginning of childbirth, and one must carefully distinguish between them.</p>
<p>(B) The First Stage of Labor… Opening Stage</p>
<p>The first stage of labor begins with labor pain, called the opening stage of labor pain, which starts with repeated uniformity and continues until the cervix is fully opened. At this time, the uterus gradually contracts, the labor pain gradually intensifies, the duration of the labor pain is 30 to 50 seconds, or perhaps longer, the interval is 10 to 15 minutes, or perhaps 2 to 5 minutes. As the labor pain intensifies, the cervix gradually dilates, and the membrane also separates from the uterus. There is often bleeding on the separation surface, so when it is discharged, there is often mucus mixed with blood, which is a sign that the cervix is dilated.</p>
<p>(1) How can the cervix dilate? The aforementioned separated membrane bulges like a cyst and enters the cervix, thus the cervix slowly dilates. This is the amniotic sac, which stores amniotic fluid (sac water). The amniotic sac is tense during labor pain and relaxed during intervals. Every time there is labor pain, the size and tension of the amniotic sac will increase, and it will press open the cervix from above. After the cervix is dilated, the edge shrinks upward. At this time, the baby's head of a primipara embeds into the pelvis, and the baby's head of a multipara is still moving at the pelvic inlet, but during labor pain, they are all fixed at the pelvic inlet.</p>
<p>(2) There is a sound when the amniotic sac ruptures. During this period, labor pains repeatedly intensify, and the pregnant woman suddenly becomes terrified, loses appetite, or even does not eat, feels cold and afraid of cold, and often has nausea and vomiting. The more the cervix dilates, the more intense the labor pain becomes, and the amniotic sac is abnormally tense. The amniotic sac no longer relaxes during the intervals of labor pain. All tensions reach the extreme. At this moment, the membrane suddenly ruptures, and at the same time, the fore sac water (amniotic fluid) is ejected. This is the rupture of the sac. The sac water weighs about 30 cm when the sac ruptures, and there is a sound.</p>
<p>(3) False amniotic fluid… False amniotic fluid, commonly known as "follicle birth," is the outflow of liquid accumulated between the decidua and chorion, which is mistaken for fore amniotic fluid, or ruptures above, so the sac water leaks, but the membrane has not ruptured.</p>
<p>(4) The timing of the rupture of the sac… If it has already ruptured during premonitory labor pain, it is called early rupture of membranes. If the cervix has not yet dilated to 5 cm and the presenting part of the fetus has not yet reached the pelvic inlet, but the sac water has already ruptured, this is early rupture of membranes. (5) The danger of early rupture of membranes… The dilation of the uterus after rupture of membranes relies entirely on the presenting part of the fetus to promote it, so it is very slow, and the amniotic fluid leaks continuously. If there is an early rupture of membranes, then the fetus is closely attached to the uterine wall, which may lead to a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>(6) Delayed rupture of membranes… The cervix has fully dilated, but the amniotic sac does not rupture. This is because the labor pain has gradually decreased, causing it to bulge outside the vulva. The placenta is pulled by it, so a part of it is separated and bleeds, hindering the fetal blood circulation, or the fetus is completely wrapped in the membrane and delivered. If the membrane is not cut open, then the fetus will inevitably suffocate and die.</p>
<p>(7) After the rupture of the sac… The labor pain often rests for a moment, and then occurs strongly again. At that time, the baby's head penetrates further into the pelvic cavity and moves forward to the second stage of labor.</p>
<p>Talking About Phlegm, Part Three</p>
<p>Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>The theories about the symptoms of phlegm disease have become extremely chaotic and bizarre since the Jin and Yuan dynasties. I will not cite them all, but record the most notable ones to show the general idea.</p>
<p>Chen Wuzhe's *Three Causes Formula* states: ["Coughing, asthma, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, restlessness, palpitations, worries, hot and cold sensations, pain, swelling, fullness, abdominal masses, urinary retention, obstruction, like wind, like epilepsy, none are not caused by phlegm and fluid."]</p>
<p>Wang Yinjun said: ["Or headache, dizziness, eye movement, ear ringing, or twitching of the mouth and eyes, itching or pain in the eyebrows and ears, or wind-like swelling and hardening of the limbs, with pain that seems not to be pain, or itching and pain in the teeth and cheeks, teeth floating and pain varying, or belching, acid reflux, heart burning, or pain or hiccups, or difficulty in swallowing, unable to cough up or swallow down, the phlegm is like ink, like broken cotton, peach gum, or clam meat, or the heart feels like frozen iron, cold pain in the heart, or strange dreams, or weakness in the feet and wrists, sudden pain in the lower back and joints, or pain in the limbs and bones that is difficult to name, with no specific location, or numbness in the hands and pain in the arms, like rheumatism, or a cold sensation like a thread rising on the back,</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>or the whole body feels like lying on thorns, or sticky, itchy eyes, canker sores, sore throat, etc., or cervical lymph node enlargement, like scrofula, or two energies intertwining between the chest and abdomen, stuffiness, like smoke rising, hot flashes in the head and face, or loss of will, madness, or stroke paralysis, or chronic debilitating diseases, or toxic leg qi, or palpitations in the heart, like being chased by a tall man, or coughing and vomiting, or vomiting cold saliva, green water, or black juice, even lung abscesses, intestinal toxins, constipation, lameness, generally internal and external diseases, all kinds are caused by phlegm, the symptoms are different and difficult to describe in detail. Since body fluids congeal into phlegm, they no longer moisten the triple energizer, so the mouth is dry, the throat is dry, the stool is constipated, the face is like withered bones, the hair is scorched, and women have amenorrhea because of this."] This is the most complex theory of phlegm disease symptoms (Xu Chunfu's *Comprehensive Medicine of Ancient and Modern Times* and Sun Dongsu's *Red Water Primal Ball* cite Wang Yinjun, the theory is even more complicated, here quoted from Liu Zonghou's *Jade Pivot Subtle Meaning* and Shen Langzhong's *Collection of Disease Mechanisms*).</p>
<p>The *Golden Chamber* already mentions symptoms of phlegm and fluid that overflow beyond stomach and intestinal diseases, such as numbness in the hands and feet, arthralgia in the limbs, and the like. And the face is flushed and hot as if drunk, and the like. These are all concurrent symptoms, but all attributed to phlegm and fluid, which is already untrustworthy. As for Wang Yinjun, he attributes all internal and surgical diseases, neurological diseases, and mental illnesses to phlegm, in order to expand the efficacy of his *Tumbling Phlegm Pills*, which is extremely absurd. Liu Zonghou then cites the words of *Pulse Classic* and *Living People's Book* to clarify that Yinjun's statements are not slander, and those who talk about phlegm later seem to be in a net and unable to escape.</p>
<p>As for the causes of phlegm, Zhang Zihe divides it into wind phlegm, heat phlegm, damp phlegm, alcohol phlegm, and food phlegm in five categories. Chen Wuzhe uses the seven emotions as internal causes, the six evils as external causes, and diet, sex, and exercise as neither internal nor external causes. Danxi distinguishes between heat, qi, fright, continuous drinking and overeating, summer heat, injury from cold things, spleen deficiency, and addiction to alcohol. There are also terms such as wet phlegm, old phlegm, depressed phlegm, and stubborn phlegm. According to the theory of phlegm disease symptoms, there is no disease that is not caused by phlegm. According to the theory of the causes of phlegm disease, there is no cause that cannot produce phlegm. Later, Liu Songfeng spoke of epidemic diseases, and then there was no disease that was not epidemic. Guo Youtao spoke of sha diseases, and then there was no disease that was not sha. All of them follow the old wisdom of the Jin and Yuan dynasties' theory of phlegm.</p>
<p>As for the causes of phlegm formation, the people of the Han and Tang dynasties only said that it was caused by the accumulation of water and fluids. The people of the Song dynasty believed that it was caused by the coagulation and turbidity of body fluids. This theory probably originated from Pang Anchang. It was also believed that it was caused by the accumulation of saliva to form fluid. This theory can be seen in Chen Wuzhe. Since then, when talking about phlegm, it is completely regarded as viscous saliva and thick, turbid sputum, and no longer regarded as water and fluid as phlegm. What is even more strange is that what is sticky and thick is regarded as phlegm, and what is clear and thin is regarded as fluid. This is what later generations commonly say, but Chen Wuzhe has the saying ["Saliva congeals to form fluid"]. If fluid is formed by the coagulation of saliva, then fluid is thicker than saliva, which is no different from phlegm. That is, even the water and fluid of the ancients are also regarded as viscous phlegm.</p>
<p>In short, the phlegm and fluid in the *Golden Chamber* only refers to the water in the stomach and intestines. Later generations recognized sticky saliva and thick, turbid sputum as phlegm, so the symptoms they saw were naturally different from those in the *Golden Chamber*. However, they did not dare to delete or modify the symptoms of water and fluid mentioned in the *Golden Chamber*. Therefore, they were compatible and inclusive, combined with the saliva in the lungs, and the theory of phlegm and fluid began to be confused. At the time of the flourishing of Jin and Yuan dynasties' fantasy and metaphysical theories, the arguments were boundless. Then, the mucus secreted by mucous membrane inflammation was also included, such as dysentery. Then, the acute neurological disorders, where the secretion of the trachea increased accordingly, were also included, such as stroke, infantile convulsion, epilepsy, and morning vomiting of alcoholics. Extending it further, diseases that had absolutely no relationship with water and mucus were also brought in, such as the inability to move the arm, numbness in the hand, and neurological symptoms such as wind noise behind the head, cicada chirping in the ears, and palpitations in the heart as if afraid of being caught. Therefore, the theory of phlegm disease is chaotic, bizarre, and impossible to investigate.</p>

<p>(2) In today's China, freelance professionals such as lawyers and accountants are all the same, but doctors are different! The most obvious difference is between the new and old schools of medicine, but the disputes within them are beyond the scope of this topic, so I won't discuss them further. Within the new school of medicine, there is a distinction between formally licensed doctors and informal doctors. These informal doctors are not from medical schools, and most of them have worked as hospital nurses or private assistants to doctors. Among them, there are some who have slightly less knowledge but are not bad in medical skills and experience. Most of these are from missionary hospitals (when there were no formal medical schools in China), but they account for only a small number. The majority of them don't know what they are talking about and regard basic medical sciences such as anatomy, physiology, chemistry, and biology as nothing. They all know that internal medicine and surgery are most closely related to physiology and anatomy, so they cannot pretend to understand them; only venereal diseases will always prescribe injections of Salvarsan ("606"), and they can become venereal disease specialists. To be honest, they think that medicine is not a science, but a skill. Therefore, whether it is a doctor's office or a rickshaw puller, as long as they see a doctor inject Salvarsan a few times and read an article on the Salvarsan injection method, they can hang up a sign to become a specialist doctor. Among them, those with longer arms and who get the guarantee of important people can also get a doctor's license. Even if they can't get it, Shanghai's concessions are extraterritorial, and they are also the place with the most venereal diseases; therefore, the title of venereal disease specialist is particularly numerous. They make the doctor's profession completely commercialized and try every means to compete. What kind of guaranteed cure for gonorrhea, complete cure with two injections, one yuan injection of Salvarsan, etc. In fact, it is four or five people dividing a bottle of solution for injection, or injecting the remaining solution from other patients, commonly known as "Salvarsan big buttock." The former is just a reduced dose with no effect, while the latter has great drawbacks. When they encounter wealthy customers, they will also say that they inject particularly high-quality Salvarsan for twenty or thirty yuan or more. But venereal disease patients are always a little embarrassed and worry that familiar doctors will tell about it, which will damage their reputation. Therefore, most of them also go to these doctors for diagnosis and treatment. As a result, the medical community is pitch-black, full of smoke and gas, right and wrong are reversed, and black and white are indistinguishable. But the patients do not get the benefit of a complete cure. Doctors in private practice cannot emulate these people because they have their own special positions and difficulties, and it is even more insufficient to encourage deception. But if there is free long-term treatment available, then these people will also find it difficult to use their cunning tricks. (3) With a free syphilis treatment center, poor patients suffering from this disease who cannot afford to seek medical treatment can receive the benefit of a complete cure. Even those who have money to treat themselves but are unwilling to receive free treatment can gradually learn that the radical treatment of syphilis is not that simple, and legitimate doctors will not be suspected of deception. Once patients have a proper understanding, the hope of completely curing the disease will be greater than it is now.</p>
<p>The above are just a few reasons that the author has randomly cited; I think there must be many places that need to be supplemented, and I hope that colleagues will pay attention to them.</p>

<p>(VII) Star Anise (Large Anise) Anisum Stellatum</p>
<p>This product originally comes from plants of the Magnolia family (Magnoliaceae), specifically the mature fruit of the star anise (Illicum verum Hooker filius), produced in various southwestern provinces of our country.</p>
<p>Shape: This product is a fruit composed of six to eleven follicles, though most commonly it has eight, hence the name "star anise." Each follicle is shaped like a small, opened boat, with its base attached to a common central axis. Below the central axis is a hook-shaped fruit stalk. The outside appears reddish-brown and has numerous wrinkles, while the inside is smooth, lighter in color, and glossy. The distal end forms a blunt bird's beak shape, containing a single, oval-shaped seed. It has a pleasant aroma and a sweet taste.</p>
<p>Composition: When this product is distilled with water, it yields volatile star anise oil, approximately five percent. This oil is composed of anethole, safrole, and anisic acid, among other substances. It also contains sugar, mucilage, and fatty oil.</p>
<p>Uses: This product is a stimulant or carminative, commonly used as a flavoring or deodorizing agent.</p>
<p>(Appendix: Old Theories) It is acrid and hot, entering the kidney and bladder meridians, soothing the Dantian, replenishing deficiencies in the Life Gate, stimulating the appetite, stopping vomiting, treating cold Qi in the small intestine, scrotal hernia, and scrotal pain. There is mention of Japanese star anise, which is the fruit of _Illicium Religiosum Sieb et Zuco_, also known as the shikimi fruit. Its shape is not very different from star anise, but it is slightly smaller, and the tip of the boat-shaped follicle is sharper and curved. Its aroma is completely different from star anise, resembling cardamom or cubeb pepper. It contains shikimic acid and is highly toxic. It must not be mixed into star anise. Previously, at Jiangsu Medical University, there was a case in Suzhou where someone died from consuming star anise. Upon examination, it was found to be not star anise but the poisonous Japanese star anise, i.e., shikimi fruit. Some pharmacies use it as a counterfeit drug due to its similar shape and lower price. Therefore, one should be especially careful when using star anise.</p>
<p>Diseases: Common Knowledge Q&amp;A</p>
<p>(Continued) by Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(III) Measles (Commonly Known as Shazi or Yuzi)</p>
<p>Question: What is measles? What is it called in Western languages? Answer: Measles is commonly known as Yuzi or Shazi. The English name is Measles, the German name is Masern, and the Latin name is Morbilli.</p>
<p>Question: What is the pathogen of measles?</p>
<p>Answer: It has not yet been discovered, but it is likely an ultramicroscopic microbe.</p>
<p>Question: Where does this pathogen exist? Answer: It exists in the blood, tears, phlegm, nasal discharge, saliva, and skin scales of patients.</p>
<p>Question: Which type of person is most susceptible to measles? Answer: Children are most susceptible.</p>
<p>Question: How is it transmitted?</p>
<p>Answer: It is transmitted through cohabitation with patients, close proximity, or inhalation of airborne pathogens.</p>
<p>Question: Why are children most susceptible to measles?</p>
<p>Answer: Because humans are all susceptible to measles; once measles is contracted, lifelong immunity is usually acquired. Therefore, almost all children get infected, while most adults have already had the disease and are no longer susceptible.</p>
<p>Question: During which season is this disease most prevalent? Answer: It tends to be more prevalent in the spring.</p>
<p>Question: How many days after measles viruses are contracted does illness develop?</p>
<p>Answer: It takes about ten days of incubation before the illness develops. Question: During the period of illness, into how many phases can we divide it? Answer: It can be divided into three phases: the prodromal phase, the eruptive phase, and the recovery phase.</p>
<p>Question: What are the symptoms of the prodromal phase?</p>
<p>Answer: The patient's face is slightly swollen, and symptoms of inflammation appear in the conjunctiva, nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, and bronchi. There is photophobia, tearing, sneezing, epistaxis, hoarseness, coughing, etc. This situation lasts for about three or four days, then mucous membrane spots and Koplik's spots appear. This is a symptom unique to measles.</p>
<p>Question: What are Koplik's spots?</p>
<p>Answer: Koplik's spots are white spots that appear on the oral mucosa opposite the molars, the size of pinheads, surrounded by a red halo.</p>
<p>Question: What is the body temperature like during this period?</p>
<p>Answer: The body temperature rises with shivering or chills in the first few days, then drops briefly, and then rises again from the third day, like a staircase.</p>
<p>Question: What are the symptoms of the eruptive phase?</p>
<p>Answer: When the body develops a rash, the body temperature rises further, showing persistent fever or remittent fever patterns; when the rash has fully emerged, the fever dissipates.</p>
<p>Question: What does the rash on the body look like? Answer: The skin rash first appears on the face, head, auricles, etc., followed by the neck, trunk, and limbs. Initially, the rash consists of blood-filled spots the size of pinheads, consistent with hair follicles; later, they gradually enlarge and merge, rising slightly above the skin surface, becoming papules that are light pink to dark red. The rash is most pronounced on the third day of the eruptive phase. The mucous membrane spots, on the other hand, subside when the skin rash becomes noticeable. Koplik's spots are also unclear. Question: What is the recovery phase like?</p>
<p>Answer: During the recovery phase, the body temperature is normal, and the skin rash gradually fades in the order it appeared, with desquamation, and then various symptoms disappear. Question: Are there any other complications during the recovery phase?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, there are. Most develop bronchitis, or even pneumonia, which can be very severe. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e153">Reflections After the Fixation of the Foreign Cent <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>—Pan Shihao</p>
<p>Since March 1st, the Shanghai Monetary Association has fixed the foreign cent at 7 qian 15 li, establishing a permanent exchange rate between silver dollars and silver taels. All currency market prices, such as small silver dollars, will henceforth use silver dollars as the standard for expressing market prices, and all account calculations will be based on silver dollars as the unit. Silver dollars have thus taken the inherent position of silver taels and replaced them. The date of implementation is only two days away (March 1st). Looking back at the past and contemplating the future, one cannot remain silent.</p>
<p>In fact, China originally had no so-called "foreign cent." Since 1497, the Mexican silver dollar has been popular and widely circulated from the states of North America to the Philippines and the ports of China. Thus, in Ningbo, Xiamen, Shanghai, and other places, in addition to the existing silver taels, the British silver dollar was used as a unit of account (because of the eagle on the coin, it was commonly called the eagle dollar, abbreviated as the British dollar). The foreign cent was created by the fluctuation of the exchange rate between the two. At that time, the influence of the eagle dollar was less than that of silver taels. The general public regarded silver taels as the national treasure and eagle dollars as foreign currency. All official and commercial accounting was based on silver taels as the principal currency. Therefore, the exchange rate between the two was expressed in foreign cents. In other words, silver taels were the principal currency, and foreign silver dollars were subsidiary currency. This was the period of origin for the foreign cent.</p>
<p>In the thirteenth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty [1887], the Guangdong Governor Zhang Zhidong was granted permission to mint domestic silver dollars to resist foreign silver dollars. The provinces of Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Zhili, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fengtian, Jilin, Fujian, Yunnan, Shandong, and Henan successively opened mints, totaling seventeen silver dollar bureaus. Because the coin designs were largely similar but slightly different, and the quality could not be consistent, discrimination arose during transactions. Thus, the types of silver dollars increased, and the market prices of foreign cents became more mixed. Taking Shanghai as an example, British dollars already had their own foreign cent, and dragon dollars such as those from Jiangnan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Fengtian each had their own foreign cent as well. Those that did not have official market prices were either traded by analogy or used with a discount, resulting in chaos and complexity, all the negative phenomena of a "miscellaneous currency system." Therefore, although the circulation volume of silver dollars increased daily and the actual transactions of silver taels gradually decreased, silver dollars still did not shed their status as subsidiary currency, and silver taels were indeed able to maintain their qualification as the primary currency. This was the period of chaos for the foreign cent. In the third year of the Republic [1914], the Tianjin General Mint, according to the National Currency Regulations, began minting new silver coins with Yuan Shikai's image. The Jiangnan Mint followed suit. The design and quality were fairly uniform, and the volume of circulation gradually increased. Old-style silver dollars were successively withdrawn and reminted, and the chaotic state of currency in the market gradually decreased. In April and August, the Shanghai Sino-Foreign Two Banks and the Money Trade Association negotiated that, in addition to British dollars, new coins, and Jiangnan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Qing silver coins, which would still be quoted separately, all other kinds of dragon dollars could be exchanged for new coins at a rate fixed by the banks, without separate quotations. This was gradually followed by other ports, and the foreign cent gradually became unified. This was the period when various kinds of foreign cents gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>After Mexico adopted the gold exchange standard, the minting of eagle dollars ceased, and the Yuan Shikai silver dollars were minted in increasing numbers each year. Although its quality and foreign cent were different from those of the eagle dollar, the general public in society mostly counted the number of coins and did not bother to calculate their weight and quality in detail. Thus, Gresham's Law occurred, and the stock of British dollars dwindled daily. Foreign banks could no longer specialize in eagle dollars for collection, remittance, and exchange. In June of the eighth year of the Republic [1919], Shanghai's local silver and money industries negotiated with foreign banks to abolish the eagle dollar foreign cent market and universally use new coins. Subsequently, the silver dollar market only quoted one type of new coin, the Yuan Shikai coin. All coins from Jiangnan, Hubei, and Guangdong were universally used, and various other domestic silver dollars with excessively low weight and quality were successively withdrawn and reminted. The public found this convenient, and other ports responded one after another. The foreign cent was thus unified from this point onward. After the establishment of the National Government, when the Sun Yat-sen silver dollar came into existence, the unification of the foreign cent remained unimpeded. This was the period of unification of the foreign cent. However, silver taels always retained their qualification as the principal currency in calculations. Whoever used silver dollars for accounting still had to fictitiously set an "immobile foreign cent" as the unit and reconcile it with the daily opening foreign cent. In reality, silver dollars were still just a type of subsidiary currency.</p>
<p>Now, the Shanghai monetary industry has decided to fix the foreign cent. Fixing the foreign cent can be said to be abolishing the market price of silver dollars. It can also be said to be abolishing the foreign cent. This is truly the initial success of the movement to abolish taels and use dollars, and a major change in the financial world for decades. It can be divided into an era in financial and economic history, and I cannot help but feel deeply about this. (I) Reflections on the Monetary System: Currency is a medium of exchange, and its own price should not change, just like weights and measures, which are used to weigh all things. Its own standard should remain unchanged. Only when it is unchanged can it be a guideline for transactions and a medium of exchange. This is the general meaning of monetary theory. Since China began minting silver dollars in the Qing Dynasty, the state has legislated for it to be the main currency for a long time. However, in reality, silver dollars had a market-based foreign cent, and its own value had to be weighed against silver taels. How could it have the qualification of a flat currency, let alone be the main currency? It was just a kind of subsidiary currency. Therefore, the proposal to abolish taels and use dollars has been around for decades, and the theory of reforming the monetary system has been voluminous. The currency actually transacted, silver dollars, was used far more than silver taels, but silver dollars ultimately failed to take the place of silver taels and complete their qualification as the primary currency. This is all because of this. If silver dollars, which have long been designated as the national currency, have not obtained their qualification as currency, then discussions on the monetary standard and studies on currency reform are not the most important topics at present. In other words, only by abolishing taels and using dollars can we begin to talk about the monetary system. Therefore, the decision of the Shanghai money industry to use silver dollars as the main currency is worthy of public praise. The term "silver dollars as the main currency" may not be understood by the general public, but in fact, since the foreign cent has been abolished implicitly, its own price has not changed, and it can be directly and easily used as a unit of currency for accounting. In addition, factors such as unlimited legal tender and free minting have already been clearly stipulated in the law. The qualification of silver dollars as the main currency has already been fully established. On the other hand, silver taels, in the near future, seem to have become a kind of lame standard with silver dollars. In fact, once the qualification of silver dollars as the main currency is established, silver taels will lose their basis for weighing all currencies, and there is no doubt that they will be eliminated as a kind of commodity-like silver. However, this theory may still be too optimistic. Why do I say this? Since the foreign cent entered the country with British dollars, it has undergone several changes before finally reaching the recent decision by the money industry to fix it. The reason for this can be said to be due to the abolition of the tael and the use of the dollar movement in the government and the public, and it can also be said to be due to the fact that silver dollars in society have become more uniform. Only when silver dollars have become more uniform can their use be convenient and the foreign cent can be single and stable. In recent months, the theory that the government will mint new coins has been widely rumored, but the weight and quality of these coins are unknown. If there are differences between these coins and the current coins, will the foreign cent still be single and stable? Will silver dollars still be able to maintain their uniform state? If their uniform state cannot be maintained, then problems will arise between silver dollars themselves. Can we prevent the silver tael system from reviving in a disguised form? This is the first reason why it is difficult to be optimistic. The second reason is that I have often argued that there are several reasons for the obstacles to the abolition of the tael and the use of the dollar, which are related to the system of taels and dollars themselves. In other words, although taels are fictitious currencies, they retain the decimal system that has existed for a very long time. There is no lack of convenience in accounting and calculation. Although silver dollars are national currencies, their so-called auxiliary currencies, such as dimes and copper coins, have daily market prices and do not have the qualification of currency. Because people are used to them and the distinction between whole and miscellaneous is clear, it is not easy for dollars to rise. Now that the foreign cent is fixed, silver taels are equivalent to ceasing. However, the silver dollar's own system has not yet been established. In fact, the National Currency Regulations only mention silver dollars. All auxiliary currencies can be said to be not yet established. How can we plan for convenience in use? This is another reason why it is difficult to be optimistic.</p>
<p>(II) Reflections on the Strength of the Monetary Industry: The monetary industry has a long history. Foreigners call them Native Banks. Those who praise them praise their simplicity and stability, while those who criticize them see them as conservative and calculating. In fact, conservatism forms the virtue of simplicity and stability, and caution is not to be criticized in business. Moreover, in terms of their conservatism, they are indeed conservative. In terms of their evolution, there is indeed something to be praised. Therefore, they have always occupied a large amount of influence in China's financial world. For example, in the matter of the foreign cent, the abolition of the market price of miscellaneous dragon dollars and the standardization of the market price of British dragon dollars could not have been achieved without their help. Industry insiders have always said that the decision on the market price of the foreign cent is in the hands of the monetary industry. In addition to a few famous banks, foreigners and foreign banks trust the monetary industry more than banks. There is some truth to this. The decision of the Shanghai monetary industry to fix the foreign cent will have far-reaching effects. Can the industry insiders make good use of this potential influence to help the improvement of the monetary and financial system? Or will they be complacent and be content to be passively pushed forward? Or will they even create obstacles to hinder the progress of all parties? This is probably not a question of system, but a question of people.</p>
<p>The one-two-five issue and the two-five issue of the foreign cent are what people in the monetary industry see as calculating, but the industry insiders can resolutely cancel them. Now that the foreign cent is fixed, the silver tael exchange rate has risen again. In the near future, silver taels should still be used. It is hoped that the industry insiders can carry out the original intention of canceling the buckle and not seek undue profits in the calculation. You must know that the cancellation of the buckle and the fixation of the price of the foreign cent in recent months and the abolition of the silver tael standard system are not so much an opportunity to be missed as a recognition that they have fallen behind. Instead of saying that they are active, it is better to see them as being passive.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Wartime Economy for Current Issues <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>—Mao Zhenchu</p>
<p>The Rehe War, concerning the life and death of China, has finally been initiated by ambitious and violent Japan! The importance of this war is such that we should mobilize all of China's manpower, financial resources, and material resources to cope with this war. At the front, of course, is where [manpower] is most concentrated, using flesh and blood to attack the enemy. At the rear, [financial resources] and [material resources] should be concentrated to cope with changes in the environment. In view of the facts of past world wars, I believe that it is necessary to strictly implement wartime economic organizations.</p>
<p>During the World War from 1914 to 1918, the entire economic organizations of all countries, including England, France, Germany, Austria, Russia, and Italy, were involved in the whirlpool of war. All of them temporarily implemented all economic policies to cope with this extraordinary state. At the beginning of the outbreak of the war in England, the economy immediately shook completely, the exchange closed, foreign exchange was cut off, financial panic, and industrial unrest. Therefore, the government immediately promulgated the order to extend the bank holiday and the suspension of debt payment, and transferred all railways, insurance, and other businesses to state-owned. On August 6, 1914, it also implemented the Currency and Bank Note Act, and at the same time abolished the previously promulgated banking regulations to restrict the issuance of banknotes by various banks. The French government, like the British government, initially ordered the postponement of the performance of contracts on the exchange, and then promulgated the debt relief order. In order to implement the relief of the financial difficulties and raise the expenses of the army's mobilization, it could only use the power of the central bank to control finances. However, as the scope of the war gradually expanded, relying on the power of the central bank alone was useless. At the end of August 1914, the cabinet was reorganized, and Li Bo's wartime financial policy was finally decided. The foundation of this policy was to issue inconvertible banknotes to serve as war expenses. Later, because these banknotes flooded the country, it used a kind of government long-term bonds to recover them, and at the same time increased taxes to overcome the difficulties of spending. Germany was relatively prepared in advance. In 1913 (the year before the war), it was actively preparing for war, expanding the army and navy as much as possible. Therefore, at that time, on the one hand, it issued huge special military bonds, and on the other hand, it levied a huge direct property tax of 500 million yuan. Therefore, in fact, after the war began, it no longer levied anything from the people. After the war started, the first to suffer a direct impact was of course the industry, trade, and shipping industries. Due to the impact of trade and shipping, food and raw materials that had always been supplied from foreign countries felt a lack at the same time, which caused difficulties for the manufacturing industries concerned, especially the manufacturing difficulties of military supplies. Therefore, the Raw Materials Bureau was established, and the German Electrical Association was established, so that all German industrial groups were of one heart and one mind for the general mobilization of the war for a month. The most important position in Germany's wartime economy was the food problem. Although the government tried all kinds of measures, such as restricting the excessive rise in grain prices, setting price limits, stipulating that wheat bread and rye wheat and potatoes should be used as military bread, establishing wartime grain agencies, and all grain supplies were controlled by the government under the monopoly system, and compulsory issuance of bread coupons was distributed to the people, etc., in the end, due to being trapped by the blockade of the Allied Powers, the food supply was on the verge of exhaustion. Other Allied countries, such as Japan and the United States, were also in a state of extreme chaos, and the wild drop in currency prices affected anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, when a wide-ranging war started in Germany, everything was abnormal. Even if Germany had prepared before the war, it still had to panic to such an extent, let alone without preparation before the war! Now, we and the enemy have actually reached a state of war, just lacking a formal declaration of war. In such a critical autumn, how can there be no organization in the economy? According to my opinion, the financial aspect has the precedent of the European War to refer to, and the government should refer to the domestic people's livelihood and industry to formulate a suitable method to implement it. One [manpower] aspect focuses on military [censored] people, and let the military authorities plan it. The most uncertain thing is probably still in the [material resources] aspect. Usually, most of our daily necessities are supplied by foreign countries. If we are in the same situation as Germany, being blockaded by the enemy, wouldn't we be in the same desperate situation as Germany? It is good that foreign countries are now having excess production. We may wish to take advantage of this and purchase a large amount of military, daily, and necessary goods from overseas before the sea ports are blockaded (of course, this refers to those that are not available or not many in domestic goods) to prepare for a protracted war. Some people say that China had a bumper harvest last year, and there is no [censored] problem in terms of food. In fact, this observation is also wrong. Originally, last year's excess of grain was an abnormal rather than a normal situation. According to the statistics of imported foreign rice over the years, as well as the vast area of bandit areas, disaster areas, and barren areas in Hubei and other provinces, and the lack of food in Fujian, Guangdong, and other provinces, if we do not try to store grain widely, we will definitely not be able to fight for a long time! We believe that it is necessary in fact to use surplus agricultural products such as foreign wheat to prepare for food. In addition, we should also use the efforts of the people to set up various cooperative organizations. Such as investigation agencies, transportation agencies, requisition agencies, distribution agencies, etc., everything is concentrated to adapt to the special economic situation of this war, so that the military can have a solid backing.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Women and Economics in China <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Mozeng</p>
<p>(1) The Position of Women in Past and Present Economic Organizations</p>
<p>When studying the past and present economic progress of China, commentators often emphasize the creation of men and overlook the contributions of women. In fact, in past economic history, women occupied an important position. In modern economic organizations, much relies on the assistance of women, and speculating on future situations, the mission borne by women is even more significant and cannot be ignored. Now, let us first talk about the past. Our country has been an agricultural country since ancient times, and the development of agriculture has relied on the division of labor between men and women. Ancient books often contain records of [men plowing and women weaving]. It is also said: [If one man does not plow, some will be hungry; if one woman does not weave, some will be cold.] The chapter on labor and leisure by Jing Jiang in the "Guoyu" (Discourses of the States) is especially passed down as a beautiful story by later generations, showing that the labor of women is also a driving force for promoting economic organization and cannot be ignored. In the process of economic evolution in Western countries, women's contributions were also very important. In the Greek and Roman eras, men's lives were mostly spent in warfare, so agricultural affairs were mostly undertaken by women. After the Industrial Revolution, the method of production changed drastically, and women were also very active in the industrial world. Our country also has this situation. In terms of material things, there are a large number of female workers in cities, all working in factories. According to surveys, the current number of female workers in our country accounts for 30% to 40% of the total number of employees, which is not a small number. In terms of service and professional occupations, the number of women serving in the business world in our country is gradually increasing (such as in banks and companies). As for those who have contributed in the arts, such as in music, fine arts, and literature, there are all outstanding talents. It is predicted that in the future, women in our country will leap to the same position as men in society, working together to seek the progress of the social economy. This is not an impossible thing.</p>
<p>(2) Women as Important Members in Today's Transformation of China's Economic Society</p>
<p>Since Chinese women have jointly created this existing economic society with men in the past, modern women should continue the enterprising spirit of their predecessors and strive to transform today's economic organization. This can be discussed in several points:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding Consumers</p>
<p>Commentators believe that the economic crisis in China today is due to the failure of consumption to adapt to production. With the production forms of the 16th and 17th centuries, and the consumption of the 20th century, the two sides lose their balance, and the national livelihood is inevitably on the verge of bankruptcy. This statement is very insightful. Frugality is a virtue and has always been a strength of our nation. In the past decade or so, social customs have become increasingly extravagant. Unnecessary waste among residents in rural areas is minimal, but in cities, the habit of luxury has become common. If this continues, the future is greatly worrying. Consumption can be divided into productive consumption and non-productive consumption. The advantages and disadvantages between them are far apart. For example, using production methods in farms and setting up machinery, although it is consumption, it is beneficial and harmless. Furthermore, if we want to seek knowledge and set up schools, it is also productive consumption. As for purchasing luxury goods to expand the market for foreign goods, it is not only useless to society but also harmful. It is non-productive consumption. The former should be promoted in our country, and the latter is tantamount to a suicidal policy and must be distinguished.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Producers</p>
<p>Today, it seems that women in our country have not thoroughly studied how to use capital. There are many speculators and few investors. Women in rural areas only know how to hoard, and goods are abandoned on the ground. This is obviously a mistake. Even in cities, those who can fully utilize capital are not often seen. For the present plan, we should shift their capital to the path of promoting real industries. This is one point. Currently, our country still lacks capital, so we must establish various institutions to accumulate it. The women's community should establish women's banks to increase the country's capital. This is the second point. Today's economic trends are changing rapidly, and in this world of fierce commercial warfare, women in our country should cultivate basic commercial knowledge as early as possible to prepare for serving society. If this is done, there will be many leading talents in the future, and the current difficulty of lacking commercial talents in our country can also be solved easily. This is the third point. Furthermore, the so-called producers have narrow and broad definitions. According to the narrow definition, it belongs to the creation of wealth. According to the broad definition, all services to the community belong to it. If women can devote themselves to society and seek welfare for the people, they are useful talents, not just those in the agricultural and industrial classes who can be called producers. This is the fourth point.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding Distributors</p>
<p>Although distribution is not the most serious economic problem in our country today, it is still worth discussing and is closely related to the women's community. It is difficult to determine by what standards the distribution of social wealth should be based. Generally speaking, one is the aristocratic theory, which advocates that social wealth should be owned by a specific class. The inheritance system is supported by those who advocate this theory. The impropriety of this theory is obvious and does not need to be discussed in detail. The second is the socialist theory, which advocates that the distribution of social wealth should be measured according to individual needs. This theory is very reasonable, but individual needs are not easy to measure, so this theory also has aspects that are not satisfactory. The third is the liberal theory, which advocates that wealth should be distributed according to individual production capacity (contribution). Compensation is directly proportional to the size of individual contributions. This theory is based on the principle of [survival of the fittest]. It is the fairest. Although the ideal state is still far from the actual situation of our country's society, there will be a day when we enter this path in the future. If women in our country want to enjoy equality in distribution with men, they must work hard for this. There is no other way to increase one's income except through hard work. Nowadays, people in our country are accustomed to taking pride in gaining without labor, resulting in fewer and fewer producers. In the future, this bad mentality must be eradicated.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding Finance</p>
<p>At present, our country's finances are extremely corrupt. Those in power are reluctant to disclose information, and the common people ignore it. In the future, if we want to put our country's finances on the right track, the people must rise up and take on the responsibility of supervision. Women in our country must first obtain the right to participate in politics, otherwise, they will inevitably have few rights and many obligations, and they will have no way to start even if they want to supervise finances. However, how easy is it to discuss politics? It will definitely take a long period of struggle before it can become widespread. For example, the women's suffrage movement in the United States began in 1870 and did not achieve results until 1850, showing that things are not easy. To supervise finances, in our country at present, we should seek appropriate restrictions on expenditures, and also study whether the source of income is legitimate. Urge the government to implement a strict budget system, and the amount of public debt issuance should also be limited. Although women in our country are not yet able to gain any power in politics, these types of issues must be studied in advance to prepare for supervising finances in the future.</p>
<p>(3) Points That the Women's Community Should Pay Attention to in the Future</p>
<p>The responsibilities borne by women in the economy are so significant that they must fully develop their abilities and utilize their own strengths. At the same time, they must correct all weaknesses so that they can have the best of both worlds. Women in our country have many special strengths that men cannot match. To name a few major ones: (1) Precision. Women are always more precise in handling things than men. Unlike men, they are prone to making careless and impetuous mistakes. This characteristic is very suitable for modern complex economic organizations. As the world's trend dictates, the economic organizations of various countries are becoming increasingly complex. Although our country is currently based on an agricultural economy and has not fully entered the industrial age, the chaotic situation of the transitional period is not easy to handle, and commercial sentiment prediction is especially difficult. Without a calm mind and keen insight, it is not enough to talk about this. The most suitable work for women in our country, such as accounting and statistics, will definitely develop in the country in the future. (2) Morality. Women pay great attention to morality, and obeying the law is also an advantage. This is certainly due to the strict restrictions imposed by society on women's actions, but it may also be due to the self-love of the women's community itself. In our country's customs, disdain for merchants has become a habit. The main reason is that in the past, some merchants monopolized and engaged in fraudulent practices, and their morality was criticized. Therefore, society had a very bad impression of merchants, and their status in society could not be improved. (In the past, foreign scholars, such as Montesquieu of France, also rejected Chinese merchants in his writings.) In the future, when women in our country participate in various economic activities in the country, they will be able to sweep away these bad habits and correct this misconception of foreigners through factual performance. (3) Frugality. This is also a virtue of women in our country that must be maintained. Under the current circumstances in our country, it is certainly not necessary to advocate asceticism in a one-sided way to hinder the source of economic progress, but it is also necessary to recognize that all non-productive expenditures must be strictly limited, otherwise, the national livelihood will inevitably go bankrupt. Production may be new, but consumption must still conform to the principles of production. If women in our country develop the habit of frugality, it will be enough to save the country's fortunes. Moreover, women account for more than half of the country's population. If they can do their best to promote it, the results will be significant, and the national economy will definitely benefit significantly.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned strengths, the women's community today should also correct its own shortcomings. Today's economic competition is becoming increasingly fierce. If you want to put yourself in an invincible position, you must have a strong and persevering heart, so that you can hope to succeed in doing things. Women seem to be somewhat lacking in this regard. Furthermore, the common problem of the women's community in our country is that their vision is short-sighted. They are only limited to the present and cannot reach the future. They only care about their own interests and cannot calculate for society. This shortcoming is a major obstacle to the development of China's economy. The failure of individual careers is a minor matter. Furthermore, modern economic trends place the greatest emphasis on organization. Therefore, modern economists often add the item of organization in addition to labor, land, and capital to form the four major factors of production. Its importance can be seen. If the women's community in our country sincerely wants to occupy a superior position in China's economic society, they must find ways to enhance their organizational abilities.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Securities: Bond Market Initially Fell and Then Rose Last Week <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>From February 20th to 25th last week, the public bond market of the Huashang Securities Exchange initially saw a sharp drop in opening prices due to the apprehensive sentiment that the Rehe War would still be unavoidable. Subsequently, as the war broke out, bullish investors panicked and sold off, causing the market price to fall even more drastically. Finally, due to the impending maturity of the February futures, short positions were squeezed and prices rose. However, the intense fighting in Nanling and Beipiao and the war situation will inevitably affect the prospects of the bond market to some extent. Nevertheless, the US silver loan to China, which has been brewing for a long time, suddenly had rumors of its imminent establishment, and there were also rumors of other countries mediating a reconciliation. The financial community slightly bought in, and various groups covered their short positions, with the northern group buying particularly aggressively. Therefore, after a period of weakness, the market price showed signs of gradual recovery. Therefore, the apparent rise in market price seems to run counter to the environment, but it is actually not accidental. Monday and Tuesday happened to be the beginning of the outbreak of the Rehe War. The northern group had frantically sold off beforehand, and bullish investors panicked and sold off. The market price fell sharply for two days, with the largest drops approaching 5 yuan and the smallest drops exceeding 1 or 2 yuan. The trend was extremely unfavorable to bullish investors. As a result, short positions in the market suddenly became crowded. However, with only Wednesday and Thursday remaining for the delivery of February futures, and large bullish investors holding firm and preparing to take delivery, the news that the silver loan was expected to be established suddenly came at this time. The financial community gradually absorbed, and the short position fortifications began to shake. In addition, the rumors of reconciliation were revived, Japanese diplomacy was outwardly stern but inwardly weak, the northern group covered its shorts, and retail investors were particularly panicked, which seemed to be completely opposite to the normal track. Therefore, from Wednesday to Saturday, the trend gradually rose. The total turnover was 47,615,000 yuan. The comparison is briefly listed below to illustrate the trend. Today is a holiday for delivery and the market is closed for one day (unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Decline of 20 Pounds, Increase in English and Indian Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton market was weak due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, weakness on Wall Street, and bullish investors taking profits. Futures fell by 17 to 20 pounds, and spot prices fell by 1 pound. English cotton futures rose by 23 points, and spot prices rose by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 3 points. Indian cotton initially rose with American cotton, but then fell back due to selling by European exporters and merchants. Pingguoer rose by 0.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 0.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 25th):</p>

<p>Shortage of Rice from the Lower Reaches of the River Causes Price to Rise</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were no shipments at all, and the shipping disputes have not yet been resolved. Therefore, there is not much stock left in the port, and retail sales are still sluggish. However, due to the lack of goods, the prices of rice from Suzhou, Tongli, Changzhou, Qingjiao, and Nangang have increased by a premium. Du Yang (imported rice) has changed to Yin Yuan (silver dollars) without honor or disgrace. However, according to the sellers, shipments cannot be resolved within one or two days, and there will be regrets about having transactions without goods.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Recently, due to the unresolved disputes over light and heavy pecks from the lower reaches of the river, there is a shortage of goods from various groups. Inventory of numbers 80 and 90 rice is low. Although retail sales of white glutinous rice are sluggish, the market situation is tight and close to the foot. There is little inventory of thin glutinous rice and early rice. Retail sales continue. Prices are strong. Yangjian (pointed rice) is turning strong, Dujian (top-grade rice) is stable, Bujian (port rice) is slightly tired, Kejian (guest rice) is fair, and Baiyuan (white yuan rice) is stable.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Silk and Tea Exports Face Daily Declines and Dumping of Japanese Silk <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Last Week's Silk Market Lacked Vitality</p>
<p>Silk Prices Fell to Minimum Levels, European Firms Still Considered Withholding Stock to Manipulate Prices</p>
<p>Chinese Silk Merchants Suffered Heavy Losses; Factories Maintained Production, Awaiting Opportunities</p>
<p>Last week, the local Shanghai and foreign firms' silk market was completely lifeless. The Japanese exchange rate continued to decline, and Japanese silk was aggressively dumped in European and American markets at rock-bottom prices, causing the market price of Chinese silk to plummet as well. New York's B-grade white filature was quoted at only 480 taels by the China Bank's telegraphic transfer rate, while the 13/15 denier type in Lyon was only 520-530 taels. During the European war, the minimum price for white filature could still reach 630-640 taels. Prices have now fallen to the lowest level. However, European and American stockpilers still considered suppressing prices to hoard stock. Chinese silk merchants believed that silk prices could not fall any further. Moreover, they knew that the United States, angered by Japan's militaristic aggression in the Northeast, was increasingly refusing to use Japanese goods. Should the American silk weaving industry stop using Japanese silk, the sales of Chinese silk in the American market would likely increase. Therefore, they all withheld their stock and waited for an opportunity. As a result, the sales of Chinese silk last week were almost stagnant. At present, only mainland silk factories took the opportunity to purchase stock, and Indian firms replenished their stocks of yellow and rough Japanese silk, totaling 80 bales. Over 500 bales were shipped out.</p>
<p>New York's Raw Silk Consumption Greatly Reduced</p>
<p>New York has always been the center of American silk fabric production. Every time the spring silk fabric sales season starts, raw silk consumption by various silk factories inevitably increases. In recent years, the proliferation of artificial silk and the brisk sales of synthetic silk fabrics have made it difficult to expect an increase in natural silk consumption. According to news from local American silk trading firms yesterday, the total amount of raw silk consumed by silk factories throughout New York City this month (i.e., February) will not exceed 42,000-43,000 bales. Last year's February raw silk consumption totaled 45,900 bales, a decrease of 3,000-4,000 bales. It is estimated that the quantity of raw silk in stock at the end of this month will be around 67,000-68,000 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Prices for Thick and Thin Raincoat Fabric are Weak <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Raincoat fabric is currently in season for spring, and sales are brisk. Both thick and thin goods have seen considerable transactions. New varieties continue to be introduced by the trade association, with single-sided waterproof American cloth being the most active. Napped, gray elephant skin-like thin cotton cloth also enjoys wide sales. Rubberized raincoat fabric also shows a strong trend. However, their prices have been weakening due to an oversupply of goods. Yesterday, the industry was quoting 1 tael and 6 mace for the 4026 old brand single-sided waterproof American raincoat fabric. Top-grade goods of ordinary brands were quoted at 3 taels and 5 mace and a half, and second-grade goods at 3 taels and 3-4 mace.</p>

<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Mr. Shicheng sighed at the crippled minds of people in an abnormal society and expressed boundless admiration for the health of Soviet Russia. I feel the same way. However, China cannot be compared to Europe and America. They are standing on the line of death, while we have already died. What appears is wandering souls and ghosts. Fundamentally speaking, there is no health to speak of!</p>
<p>"How can one avoid the sorrows and resentments of life?" I agree with this statement. How can we answer the "sorrows and resentments of life?" For thousands of years, sages, heroes, literati, and scholars have only had the following three ways: "My heart is sorrowful, anxiously like pounding: I feign sleep with perpetual worry, worrying makes me old; my heart is full of melancholy, and sickness is like a headache." (Poetry, Xiaobian) This is the first way: sorrowing until old age, without any hope. "Have you not seen the bright mirror in the high hall grieving over white hair, in the morning like black silk, in the evening becoming snow?" "In life, one should enjoy every pleasure, do not let the golden goblet face the moon in vain!" This is the second way: dancing, drinking, and letting the years pass by. "Hoo-hoo, you finish singing, I take the stage, mistaking another place for my hometown. How absurd!" In the end, it is all making wedding clothes for others! This is the third way: it is destined to be so, and everything is in vain. When we look at literary works, no matter what form they take, their fundamental concepts, apart from this individualism of "sorrow," "decadent enjoyment," and "predestination," is there any other healthy consciousness? Apart from numbing the youth to make them complacent with the status quo, is there any other effect? Flying to and fro, gray owls hoot the death knell of the Chinese nation! Have the new literary writers since the May Fourth Movement jumped out of this circle?</p>
<p>"No Struggle, No Drama." I am deeply moved by the words of this great critic. If we cannot answer life with a positive attitude, if we cannot experience the "joy of life," and if we cannot understand a nation with the power of a collective, I am afraid that we will never have life and will forever be reduced to wandering souls and ghosts!</p>
<h3 id="e162">Liwa Lida Village <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Shiying</p>
<p>That day was the Dragon Boat Festival! Such great weather! But in the city, the sky is not blue enough, and the sun is not bright enough. Pei Pei and I went to Liwa Lida to find a wider field, a taller sky, and the youngest moment of one o'clock. Leaving the city in the city, we arrived in the suburbs in the early summer breeze. After crossing the Suzhou River, there was a very long path with willows on both sides, their branches dragging straight to the ground. After walking the path, we saw a field of grass, a river, a red house, a bandstand, and white tablecloths, black coffee, a row of old trees swaying in the breeze, and some dreams.</p>
<p>Over there, the wheat fields stretched straight from the edge of the village to the horizon. On the horizon, there was a tree with a crow's nest, next to a pile of fences, a black tiled house, and from there, the Liwa Lida River gently rolled to the edge of the village.</p>
<p>We rowed a narrow, double-oared boat into the middle of the water, letting it drift with the current. It was a flowing sky, without clouds. A warm breeze brought the double song of the cuckoo from the horizon, blowing, blowing, from horizon to horizon, from wheat field to wheat field. The wind, the song, floated to the wheat ears, floated to the surface of the water, and then dissipated like smoke in Pei Pei's hair.</p>
<p>She sighed softly. I smiled.</p>
<p>Next to the boat, a hundred geese slept on the ripples, their heads tucked under their wings. In front, a Russian man was also rowing a boat. Quiet water, quiet sky, quiet fields, quiet boat, even the back in the white shirt exposed on the edge of the boat was quiet. Only the two oars rose and fell together. Pei Pei's face had sunlight, a dark and delicate red face, a healthy face. My nose also had sunlight, and I took a deep breath, wanting to absorb it. I smiled. She sighed again.</p>
<p>It was not easy to see her sitting so quietly. Her brown eyes were transparent, with an intense fragrance, intense light and shadow. But today, her eyes were a pair of dreams, darker and deeper than usual. She also did not laugh as loudly or speak as loudly as usual.</p>
<p>A sound of a guitar drifted from the shore, quietly. I lit a cigarette. The smoke slowly drifted into the willow branches. It was dusk. In the twilight, I saw her pupils turn black, staring at me. I thought, thinking of when I first met her.</p>
<p>We will only return when we are sitting on the moon! The moon topped the head of the Russian man rowing in front, he had bald hair, rowing two silver oars.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Poor Child <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Peng Xuezhen</p>
<p>"Poor child! You don't want people to call you that," but don't pout your little mouth, you should learn to be more patient!</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from your sister from Nanning, and I was really surprised that she ran so far. She told me that she had no choice but to leave you, Minmin, at home, which made her very sad. I also sighed for you when I heard that!</p>
<p>You probably don't remember: one summer two years ago, I came to your house for the first time, and also only this once, to see Minmin, whom I had wanted to see for a long time. At that time, you were barefoot, being punished by them, sitting on a mat. It was terribly hot, and you were only wearing a sweaty undershirt, exposing your small, flabby arms. You were clamoring to get off the ground, but they wouldn't let you wear shoes. You were really stubborn, you refused to call me. I still can't forget your lively little eyes, the little eyes that turned into a line when you smiled. Your sister took me around Nanhu. You wanted to come along, but she stubbornly refused. After we walked out the door, you were carried in by the old nanny. I could still hear your loud cries from afar. You must have been thinking: my sister only cares about her friends and not Minmin, right?</p>
<p>At Yanyu Tower, I said, "Minmin is too pitiful!" Your sister didn't say anything, just sighed softly. Minmin, from her deeply furrowed brow, I could see how much she loved you!</p>
<p>The year before last, your sister came, taking a stroll around Canglang Pavilion, looking at the distant fields and the blue sky. She was thinking about you again. The aunt didn't like Minmin's bad temper, told you to be a good boy. But Minmin raised her small face and said seriously, "Minmin has no mom!" You said it so well! You really have it in you, Minmin. A six- or seven-year-old child can say such words. You understand the loneliness of a child without a mother's love. Do you remember your mother who died two years ago? Good, you should always remember her. That is what you should do!</p>
<p>You are a clever child, often uttering words from your little mouth that are more innocent and profound than adults. So your sister often said, "This child needs someone to carefully take care of, too clever."</p>
<p>Isn't that so? Your father also died the year before last, and your older siblings all work, so you follow them everywhere. A six-year-old child lives in kindergarten. It is said that you are very good there, but too restrained, not so lively. Are you too sensible, or are the other children bullying you? Minmin, tell me!</p>
<p>Your sister has now gone far away, and there are fewer relatives around you. You can't help looking for your sister everywhere when you come back from school, right? She has gone to that southern country full of bananas and palm trees. Have you cried about this?</p>
<p>Do you admit that you are a poor child? You should firmly shake your little head: Minmin is not poor! Minmin has older brothers who care for her, older sisters who love her, and aunts who like her! You are smart, yes, so you have to understand more things: there are many poor children in this world. Have you seen the children in the neighborhood who don't have enough to eat or wear? You should study hard, play hard, and the days without hardship are in the future! Show some courage, look at this world that is more ferocious than the tiger mask your sister bought you, then you will know if you are a poor child!</p>
<p>Smile! Have the small trees in the yard sprouted? Children are as hopeful as those green sprouts, especially our poor children!</p>

<p>— by Xiao Boner, translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>The sorcerer was stunned, but he immediately smiled at Ge Di. He replied, "Let's not make this a personal matter, shall we?"</p>
<p>"However, if it's not a personal matter, it's meaningless," the black girl said. "If I were to do as you tell me,"</p>
<p>"What should I do! I tell you that I love you! Don't you feel that I am being impudent?"</p>
<p>"Of course not," the sorcerer said. "You mustn't think like that. Although you are black and I am white, we are equal before the God who created us like this."</p>
<p>"I didn't think like that," the black girl said. "When I spoke, I didn't say that I am a black person and you are just a pitiful white person. Please treat me as a white queen and yourself as a white king. What does it matter? Why are you staring blankly?"</p>
<p>"There, there," the sorcerer said. "Oh, I am the most pitiful of all pitiful white people; but I also regard myself" as a king. This is when people's evil forces me to go mad."</p>
<p>"I've seen even worse kings," the black girl said; "You don't need to be ashamed. Oh, oh, like in the Bible, you" be King Solomon, and I'll be the Queen of Sheba. I came to you to say that I love you. That means coming to possess you. I embrace the lioness's to eat you, to make you a part of myself. From now on, you can only think of things that make me happy, and not of things that make you happy. I will stand between you and yourself, between you and God. Isn't this terrible tyranny? Love is something that devours people. Can you imagine a heaven within which there is love?"</p>
<p>"There is nothing else in my heaven. What else is heaven besides love?" the sorcerer said boldly, but also uncomfortably.</p>
<p>"There is also glory. That is the image of God, the home of God's thoughts: there is no flirtatious style, no lingering like lice clinging to the body of a sheep. I The pastor is talking about love; but she avoids all her lovers, and works for God. Those white people turn their eyes away when they see me, fearing that they will fall in love with me. There are groups of men and women who are devoted to God's work, calling themselves brothers and sisters, but they don't even speak to each other."</p>
<p>"They see through," the sorcerer said.</p>
<p>"Of course, this is stupid," the black girl said. "We have to live with people, we have to be satisfied with"</p>
<p>"That's it. However, our souls need solitude, just as our bodies need love, isn't that obvious? We need each other's physical help and each other's spiritual help: but our souls have to be alone with God; whenever people come to love you, to want your soul, your spirit, and your body, you say like this, 'Don't come close: I belong to myself, not to you.' That kind of 'love argument, for me who is seeking God, is more insulting'" than for a warrior who must fight against slavery and murder, or for a hunter who must kill or see his children starve."</p>
<p>"Then, can I say 'You must kill each other; this is the commandment given to you'?" the sorcerer said.</p>
<p>"That's just turning the previous statement around, [the black girl said. [It is not a law of life. To be honest with you, this kind of cure-all commandment of yours is like the pills sold to us by quacks: it's useful one out of twenty times, and it's useless nineteen times. Moreover, I am not seeking commandments. I am seeking God."</p>
<p>"Continue seeking, may God be with you," the sorcerer said. "You must pass through me to find such a God, go" searching," he said, and then he disappeared.</p>
<p>"This is probably your specialty," the black girl said; "But I'm a little sad that I lost you; because I feel in my heart" that you are a lovely man, and you have a good heart."</p>
<p>She went another mile and met an old fisherman carrying a huge church on his shoulders.</p>
<h3 id="e165">"Panning for Gold in the Sea" <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang Zhen</p>
<p>Green sea, blue sea, stormy sea, shining with the golden sun, the silver moon… From ancient times to the present, how many poets and writers have praised this, giving them how much comfort, how much encouragement, and how many feelings! However, what scientists see in the sea seems to be completely different from what poets see!</p>
<p>According to many scientists, the sea, which has become the source of "poetic emotions" for poets and writers, is the world's largest treasure trove, and we can pan out brilliant gold and silver from the sea. Their research shows that every ton of seawater contains ten milligrams of silver, so if we calculate the total amount of seawater in the world at 127 million cubic . And the total population of the world is 1.5 billion, each person can get a silver block worth 9 million yuan to distribute. As for the gold content, it is even more than silver, and it is said that every ton of seawater contains an average of 50 milligrams of gold, so if it is distributed according to the total population of the world mentioned above, each person can get a gold block of 48,000 grams!</p>
<p>Friends, do you say you are poor? However, the property that you should be allocated is so much, but it is scattered in the sea!</p>
<p>"Panning for gold in the sea", who can still laugh at this! Some chemists who dream of gold have been engaged in the research of "recovering gold from seawater" and "recovering silver from seawater" for several years, and are still constantly doing experiments!</p>

<p>— Xin Hong</p>
<p>Since the Russian literary master Gorky's unfortunately masterpiece "The Lower Depths" was published, he has rarely had his new plays.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that the second part of's two-part drama "Destigeve and Others" will be handed over to the Moscow Haidan Hoff Theater for performance. This script was written by Gao in two months in 1917. The first performance is scheduled for April 15 this year, and there will definitely be a grand event at that time.</p>
<p>It is understood that the first part of Gao's two-part song is "Paraysive and Others", which was performed in Moscow and achieved great success.</p>

<p>Over 400 Enemy Cavalrymen Buried in the Desert in the Kailu Area</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Suzuki Brigade completely concentrated in Chaoyang on the 26th in the morning, and then divided into two routes, one heading to Lingyuan to support the back of Lingnan. On the 27th in the morning, contact was made at Pingfangzi Polo (between Da Chi). One headed to Jianping, and clashed with our army between Damiao and Laohushan on the 27th in the morning. Several enemy planes bombed Lingyuan, Jianping, Yebaishou and other places on the 27th in the morning, and distributed leaflets to persuade foreign missionaries to leave the war zone quickly. On the Lingnan side, the battle situation from the 26th in the morning was fierce. The enemy traitors reached more than 20,000. On the 27th in the morning, contact was made with our volunteer army between Naiman Wangfu and Fifty Families. According to reliable reports, the Japanese army plans to release poison gas and smoke bombs if Lingyuan and Jianping are difficult to attack. A large number of poison gas shells are being transported to Chaoyang. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Our army's positions such as Baiyaoliang in Chaoyang are still in fierce battle. According to the telegram from Brigade Commander Dong, the troops counterattacked the Japanese Baisaka Camp position at 7 pm on the 25th and completely recovered it in the middle of the night. They are now confronting the enemy. In the Baishizu area on the border of Lingnan, there has been fierce fighting from the morning of the 26th to the present, and the enemy has not made an inch of progress. After the volunteer army captured places such as Mizigou near Koumen on the 25th, the enemy transferred reinforcements from Wanjia Village one after another. The enemy's reinforcements on that side were only the Suizhong route. The volunteer troops of Zheng Guilin and others are fighting the enemy separately in the Lishugoumen and Mingshui areas to contain their actions. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram was received from the front line this morning stating that the 60-mile-long front line from Chaoyang in the west to Baishizu is currently under fierce attack by 30,000 Japanese troops. However, Baishizu has not been invaded by the enemy. Dong Futing is currently defending against the enemy with the Fourth Brigade. It also said that the Japanese army bombarded fiercely with artillery and then charged with cavalry, but failed to cross the mountain pass. Repeated attacks were repelled by Chinese electric shocks, and many enemy corpses were abandoned in the mountains. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th) (Beiping) According to the Chengde telegram, the enemies at Shaomao Mountain, Yaoyu Temple, and Qingshanling have all been defeated. Enemy planes have been flying to Chifeng, Jianping, Lingyuan, Pingquan and other counties for reconnaissance and bombing for days. Lingyuan suffered the most. Our army has a meticulous deployment on the line from Damiao to Shaomao Mountain, which is more than 140 miles long. (27th Dispatch) (Beiping) Tang Yulin telegraphed Ping saying that more than 200 enemy infantrymen were found in front of Hailyingzi and shelled the position of our Sixth Company. More than 200 enemy infantrymen were also found in Luotuoyingzi and were attacking our front line. Baiyao found to be riding four to five hundred, and the advance troops were engaged in fierce fighting with our Fourth Company. They were immediately ordered to resist fiercely in all positions. (27th) dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Dong Futing telegraphed Ping tonight that his troops are now concentrated on the west bank of the Daling River. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Chengde telegram said that enemy and traitor cavalry fought fiercely with our Cui Brigade near Naiman Wangfu all day today. Our army showed a hundred times more courage and killed countless enemies. More than 400 enemy cavalrymen were buried in the desert. At the same time, Feng Guhai's troops also advanced northward from Xiawa. After fighting for about five hours, the enemy and traitor cavalry retreated northward one after another. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde telegram, traitor army Yu Qiang's second brigade commander Yinpu, led more than 2,000 troops to Liujiazi to defect, and joined Wang Xianting's troops. The clothing, weapons, and equipment were complete. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>A Reuters reporter from Chengde inspected Rehe today, passing through Pingquan and reaching Lingyuan. The troops along the line were extremely excited. What is even more commendable is that the civilians did not show any signs of panic. Even when enemy planes bombed them with bombs, they remained calm. The civilians were like this, so the spirit of the soldiers can be imagined. Yesterday, a Japanese plane dropped a bomb over Yebaishou Village near Lingyuan, killing a child. The reporter said, "I heard the rattling of the plane and the explosion of the bomb, but I did not see any villagers panicking. The villagers seemed to have the determination to resist the enemy. Japanese planes have now begun to bombard the roads. Today, a Japanese plane tried to bomb a team of cars carrying refugees leaving Chaoyang, similar to the bombing of refugee trains with bombs in the three eastern provinces. Today, a woman was bombed to death 20 miles southwest of Lingyuan, but none of the cars were hit. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde telegram at 3 pm on the 26th. After the Japanese traitor army launched a general attack on the 25th, the war on all lines became more intense. According to reports from the front, after our army in Kailu changed its new front line, the enemy continued to advance to southern Lu. Although the enemy's purpose on this route was in Chifeng, the army's advance was extremely difficult, because the area between southern Lu, Jianping and Lindong was purely an alluvial area of the Laohe River and Xilaolun River, and weapons such as tanks became useless. The cars recently shipped by the enemy from Shenyang were originally intended to use them to transport troops forward, but as a result, they were still stopped in the Kailu area due to desert obstacles. Today, enemy and traitor cavalry fought fiercely with our Cui Brigade near Naiman Wangfu. All day long, our army was 倍.The courage was doubled, and countless enemies were killed. More than 400 enemy cavalrymen were buried in the desert. At the same time, Feng Zhanhai's troops also advanced northward from Xiawa. After fighting for about five hours, the enemy and traitor cavalry retreated northward one after another. (Central News Agency dispatch on the morning of the 27th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Suidong County, south of Kailu and close to the Liaoning border, has now been occupied by Japanese troops. Fuxin is still garrisoned by a unit of the Volunteer Army. This area is strategically important, and the enemy is making every effort to advance toward Lingnan. Furthermore, a large force was dispatched from Suizhong, crossing the mountains, and engaged our troops in fierce fighting for several hours around Mount Sha Mao that evening. The enemy retreated after being unable to withstand the attacks, and our troops advanced to the area of Baishizuizi. This morning, the enemy dispatched 10,000 reinforcements from Suizhong. A major battle is expected to occur tonight. Due to our troops having to cover a long front line from the northeast of Chaoyang to the Mount Sha Mao area, it was decided that starting on the 27th, a plan to reinforce the forces would be implemented, concentrating our strength. Coupled with the strategic importance of the mountain roads, we will certainly be able to await the enemy in a position of strength and deal them a heavy blow. The recent situation depends on the progress of the advance on Lingnan. We have amassed a large force and are determined to defend it to the death. (27th Exclusive Dispatch)</p>

<p>Ju Zheng's Report at the National Government Memorial Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week service for the Premier at 9:00 AM on the 27th. Chairman Lin, Ju Zheng, He Yaozu, Chen Shaokuan, Lu Chao, Wei ..., and more than 400 staff members from the three departments of the National Government attended. Chairman Lin led the proceedings, and Ju Zheng delivered a report entitled "Vow to Save the Nation and Fight the Enemy to the Death," stating that in recent days, the anti-Japanese soldiers in Rehe have been fighting the enemy to the death. All Chinese people are eager to take action because the evil demons of East Asia have betrayed their race and the ancestors of their culture and harmed their fellow countrymen. Despite our repeated tolerance, they are constantly preparing and plotting to disrupt world peace. Fortunately, reason and justice still exist in the world. The League of Nations resolution still gives the demons room to maneuver, but they are angered and intend to be enemies of the entire world. Our country is the first to bear the brunt. Faced with this serious crisis, we must only look to ourselves, to "vow" and to "fight to the death." Why talk about "vowing" at this time? Because for thousands of years, our country has been characterized by a slow pace. The disadvantage of this is that we are left with nothing but to await death. When disaster strikes, we are as docile as sheep. Instead of seeking determination, it is better to hope for the initiation of a vow, which will be of great benefit to personal advancement. If the people of the nation all vow together, those with wealth will contribute wealth, and those with ability will contribute ability, to achieve the goal of saving the world and the nation. The key to fighting to the death lies in being able to act, being strong and persistent, and being calm. All countries in the world are paying close attention to our engagement with the enemy. The government and the actions of the people should be very cautious. From the beginning of the attack on Rehe, Japan has been promoting the blockade of our ports, even disturbing North China with threats. We will not panic because of this, nor will we be negligent in our determination to fight to the death, to engage in a protracted war. After three to five months, when the cunning plans of the violent Japanese are frustrated, and other countries take advantage of their weaknesses and impose sanctions, Japan will inevitably submit, and the East Asian incident will come to a small conclusion. Otherwise, it will inevitably trigger a world war, and the result will be that the violent Japanese will be the first to fall. We must not harbor any thoughts of侥幸, persevere, and the deeper the pain, the more steadfast our struggle. When all the people are united, this is the true meaning of fighting to the death. Comrades, let us vow to save the nation and fight Japan to the death, and next year today, we will have a commemorative celebration of our success in resisting Japan.

<p>(London) It has been rumored from the Far East by the Japanese that British Foreign Secretary Simon allegedly stated to Japan that if Japanese actions were limited to Rehe, the British government would not oppose Japanese actions in Rehe. A Reuters reporter questioned the British Foreign Office in London about this statement. The British Foreign Office immediately and categorically denied it, saying that British Foreign Secretary Simon had not seen the Japanese ambassador for two weeks, so how could this statement have been made? Furthermore, the British government's attitude is consistent with the attitude of the report passed by the League of Nations General Assembly last Friday. (26th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) There are rumors that Foreign Secretary Simon had notified Japan that the British government has no objections to the activities of Japanese and Manchurian troops in Rehe, but only if it is limited to that province. London has formally denied this news. (26th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>The "China Press" London special dispatch on the 26th said that the Shanghai-published news that British Foreign Secretary Simon had notified the Japanese government that if the Japanese-Manchurian army attacked Rehe and was limited to that province, then the British government would not oppose this action has now been firmly denied by the authorities here. It is verified that this news was transmitted by the Japanese United Press, which stated that before starting the attack on Rehe, the Japanese Foreign Minister inquired about the attitudes of the British, American, French, Italian, and German ambassadors stationed in Tokyo. Of these five countries, only Britain replied that if the Japanese-Manchurian army's operations did not go beyond the scope of Rehe Province, the British government had no objections to this action.</p>
<p>In addition to the British Foreign Office formally denying this news, I (the reporter claims himself) also learned that the British government unequivocally supports the League of Nations' resolution that Japanese troops should withdraw from Manchuria, and also learned that the American government has agreed with Britain's position on this matter.</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal to ban the shipment of arms to China and Japan, news has been received from official circles that the British government has refused to allow a ban specifically against Japan, because any arms shipped to China are likely to be seized by the Japanese fleet, so this plan is very difficult to implement.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Navy's junior leadership is studying the impact of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. It is reported that the following issues will arise: (1) The South Seas Mandate Issue: The location of the South Seas Islands is of great importance to the Japanese Navy's operations in the Pacific. There are various discussions about the issue of its sovereignty, but the Japanese Navy interprets its sovereignty as being in Japan and is determined to protect the South Seas with force. (2) Naval Disarmament Issue: Due to being bound by the Washington and London treaties, the Japanese Navy cannot completely withdraw from the disarmament conference and intends to send appropriate representatives to participate in the conference. (3) Economic Blockade Issue: If the League of Nations applies group sanctions and implements an economic blockade against Japan, Japan will confront it with force.

The banking crisis in Maryland and Michigan is also being followed by President-elect Roosevelt and future Secretary of State Hull. The Washington Financial Good Samaritans are considering lending to banks in Baltimore and Detroit. According to a report from Lima, Ohio, the First American Trust Company decided to allow withdrawals of two percent of deposits. Yesterday, the Governor of Maryland announced a three-day holiday for all banks and financial institutions in the state to facilitate the resolution of measures to curb the large number of withdrawals. The eight-day period of bank holidays in Michigan has now been extended.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 26th: Following the banking crises in Michigan and Maryland, discussions are now taking place throughout the United States on authorizing governors to declare suspensions of payments to protect banks and depositors.

The governors of Indiana, Arkansas, and Wisconsin have now signed bills authorizing the declaration of suspensions of payments if necessary. At the same time, New York and New Jersey, among five other states, have passed new laws increasing the power of officials to assist banks in maintaining operations and facilitating reorganization. Four banks in Arkansas, with a total of $5 million in deposits, have now been merged into the National Commercial Bank and Trust Company.

Manchuria's secession from China will be a barrier to the communist danger in the Far East.

<p>Dismantling Railway Tracks and Robbing Trains</p>
<p>(Moscow) This dispatch from Berdi reports that the situation on the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway is now becoming increasingly dangerous. Armed "Red Beard" bandit gangs, often in front of the Japanese army, openly intrude into railway stations and residences of railway employees, engage in robbery, and even destroy railway tracks in an attempt to derail trains. Although the railway authorities have requested protection, the "puppet Manchuria" and the Japanese army have not taken any measures to prevent this harassment or to arrest the robbers after the fact. According to reliable sources, the reason why these bandits dare to act with impunity is because their leaders have close relations with officials of "puppet Manchuria" and the Japanese. (26th TASS Telegram) (Moscow) Today, this location received a telegram from Heihe stating that the situation on the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway is extremely dangerous. Bandit gangs frequently attack railway stations and outposts. Although there are Japanese troops along the line, the bandits are not afraid at all and continue to carry out robberies. Afterwards, they still get away with their crimes. On several occasions, bandits have dismantled the railway tracks and robbed trains. Although the Railway Bureau has appealed to the Japanese-Manchurian authorities for assistance, the Manchurian authorities and the Japanese army have not taken any action to stop the activities of these people. It is said that the leaders of the bandit gangs have close ties with officials of Manchuria and related Japanese. (26th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Reaches Over Eight Billion</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Tokyo said that according to the latest statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Finance, the country's national debt has reached over eight billion. Now, it is further invading Rehe, and the financial situation is becoming increasingly unsustainable. The Japanese zaibatsu have occupied the Northeast, and the annual maintenance cost is about 40 to 50 million, which is extremely difficult. As a result of the Japanese zaibatsu's militarism, Japan's rural areas are increasingly collapsing. The total amount of debt owed by farmers has exceeded 1.2 billion yuan. There are approximately 5.57 million farming households nationwide, with an average debt of 1,200 to 1,300 yuan per household. The annual interest on the debt is about 110 yuan. The income from agricultural products is not enough to pay off the debt. The price of agricultural products is falling daily. Before the European War, the highest price of Japanese silk was about 4,000 yuan per province, but now it has fallen to 400 yuan. The price of rice was at its highest 50 yuan, but now it has fallen to 20 yuan. The cost of rice per stone and taxes combined is about 21 yuan. Farm children account for 83% of the total number of soldiers in the country, so it affects the instability of the military's morale. The Tokyo Stock Exchange has even had five days of closure. The gold standard has now fallen from more than three yuan to nine jiao. Amid the rural bankruptcy and economic panic, the Japanese zaibatsu are still actively conscripting soldiers. Those who are conscripted are mostly pampered and afraid of death. The Japanese government is also concerned about the high number of Japanese soldiers dying, because it feels unable to raise funds for the compensation of the dead. When Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated and was on the verge of death, he still said that he feared that Japan would inevitably face a dangerous situation in the future. (26th Exclusive Dispatch)</p>

<p>Many Male and Female Workers Injured</p>
<p>A Loud Explosion Shakes the Vicinity</p>
<p>Seventeen Injured and One Dead Already Known</p>
<p>The Exact Number of Dead and Injured Still Awaits Further Investigation</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM this morning, at the Yonghe Industrial Company in West Baoxing Road, Zhabei, the rubber factory's boiler exploded due to electrical leakage and carelessness. The loud explosion shook the vicinity. At the time, hundreds of male and female workers were working and fled in panic upon hearing the news. The Zhabei Fourth Fire Brigade rushed to the rescue and successively rescued seventeen injured male and female workers and pulled out the body of a female worker. As of the time this newspaper went to press, rescue efforts were still underway, and the exact number of dead and injured is still under investigation. The details of the accident are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e195">Rubber Factory's Carelessness <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The Yonghe Industrial Company on West Baoxing Road, Zhabei, was founded in 1918 and was originally a cosmetics manufacturing company. It began to operate a rubber factory in 1930, manufacturing rubber shoes, rubber balls, and other products. During the January 28th Incident last year, many of the factory's buildings were destroyed by bombing, and the inventory was also burned to the ground, resulting in a loss of 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. After the Japanese troops withdrew, the factory worked to restore the factory site on West Baoxing Road in Zhabei, which was entirely used as a rubber factory, while the cosmetics factory was moved to Kang Nao Te Road. The entire rubber factory has approximately 300 female workers and 200 male workers. The business is considered quite good. At around 11:30 AM this morning, some of the workers had already left work, while others were still working.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Four Loud Explosions <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Suddenly, the boiler exploded due to electrical leakage. The loud explosion sounded like artillery fire, followed by flames. All four of the factory's boilers were affected one after another, and the sound shook the vicinity. Nearby residents thought that another major incident had occurred and came out to investigate. At the time, the factory was engulfed in flames, and the Zhabei Fourth Fire Brigade rushed to the rescue, making efforts to rescue male and female workers from danger. By this time, most of the workers had escaped to safety, with only a few trapped in the flames, crying for help. The firefighters then successively rescued seventeen injured male and female workers. This reporter rushed to investigate at around 1:00 PM this afternoon. The factory's thick smoke had not yet dissipated, and the firefighters were still continuing their rescue efforts and pulling out the body of a female worker. Her face was blurred, making it difficult to identify her. It is expected that more will be found, so the exact number of dead and injured still awaits the factory's final investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Losses of Tens of Thousands of Yuan <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>This reporter visited the factory authorities and was told that all four boilers had been completely destroyed, but the inventory had not yet been affected, with losses of around 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The factory has been working to recover since the war, and it is unfortunate that it has suffered another disaster. The dead and injured male and female workers will be given generous compensation for medical treatment and care. An active investigation is currently underway. The number of dead and injured can only be known accurately after the flames are completely extinguished.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Injured Persons' Names <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>

<p>The Ministry Dispatches Jing'an Warship to Transport Machinery</p>
<p>Active Expansion After the Shanghai-Xiamen Merger</p>
<p>The Shanghai Hongqiao Naval Aviation Office, since the resignation of Aviation Office Director Shen Dexie, the Ministry of the Navy has appointed Chen Wenlin as his successor and resolved to move the Shanghai Aviation Office to Xiamen. This morning, a reporter inquired at the Gaochang Temple Naval Headquarters and learned that the Naval Aviation Office currently has five training aircraft. Since receiving the order to move to Xiamen, it has been handling the closing procedures and has already completed all of them. The Ministry of the Navy plans to dispatch the Jing'an warship from Beijing to Shanghai within this week to transport all the machinery, equipment, documents, and other items to Xiamen. Director Chen Wenlin will also accompany the ship to supervise the operation. The scale of the Xiamen Naval Aviation Office is originally larger than that of Shanghai, with a total of more than ten training aircraft. In the future, after the Shanghai and Xiamen offices are merged, it is planned to actively find ways to expand and purchase more aircraft. The original staff of the two offices will also need to be reduced and reorganized.</p>
<h3 id="e200">China Aviation Association Plans to Establish Flying School <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Requests Assistance from the Aviation Administration to Borrow Airfield and Instructors</p>
<p>Donations to Be Allocated to Three Items: Purchasing Aircraft, Building Factories, and Running the School</p>
<p>The China Aviation Association is planning to establish a flying school to train aviation pilots, as reported in various newspapers. Recently, the association is in contact with the Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Military Affairs, requesting the Aviation Administration to do its best to help by borrowing airfields and instructors to save expenses and realize the plan as soon as possible. The donations received by the association will be allocated to three items: purchasing aircraft, building aviation factories, and running the flying school. The association greatly agrees with the patriotic aviation lottery tickets and methods initiated by the Shanghai Minbao Newspaper Office. However, since the Custody Committee already has this type of organization, there is no need for further discussion. When selling lottery tickets, purchasers can specify that the funds be allocated to one of the above three uses. Regarding the organization of the Custody Committee, it will be submitted for discussion at the third board meeting in early March. The association has been very busy in recent days preparing application supplies for the recruitment team. It also worked as usual yesterday, which was a weekly holiday.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Deadline for Recovering China Merchants' Stock is Tomorrow <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Many People Have Been Paying Tickets to the Central Bank in Recent Days</p>
<p>Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was nationalized last winter, the Ministry of Communications has announced measures to recover commercial shares, ordering the Central Bank to handle it in conjunction with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and setting the deadline at the end of February. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company announced the measures and sent personnel to the Central Bank to begin collecting shares. Initially, many shareholders were still skeptical and took a wait-and-see attitude, so the number of stock registrations was not large. Later, the Ministry of Communications and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company repeatedly explained and firmly declared that the deadline for stock recovery would not be extended. Therefore, in recent days, those paying shares have been rushing, with a daily number of about one thousand sets. As of the 26th, more than 24,000 sets have been obtained. This morning, those going to pay stock were even more enthusiastic, and those handling the matter were unable to cope, so they telephoned the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to send additional personnel to help and also requested that they bring large boxes to store the stocks. According to General Manager Liu Hongsheng, the stock recovery period will definitely not be extended. Today is already the 27th, only one and a half days away from the deadline, so it is feared that the entire amount cannot be collected. However, judging from the situation this morning, it should be possible to collect three-quarters (the total amount is 40,000 sets). As for the measures for unsubmitted stocks, they will be submitted to the Ministry of Communications for instructions. As for the issue of recovering the Yangtze Wharf, the bureau has reached an agreement with the Ministry of Communications and can utilize it once the Ministry's order arrives.</p>

<p>Regarding the whereabouts of Feng Yuxiang, who is rumored to be entering Beijing soon, according to Zhang Zhijiang, Director of the Central Guoshu Institute, Mr. Feng is currently still in Zhangjiakou. However, Mr. Feng had repeatedly stated before that once the central government decides on the overall anti-Japanese plan, he will immediately rush to Beijing to participate in the work. It is said that the central government has now decided on the overall anti-Japanese plan, so the date of Mr. Feng's arrival in Beijing should not be far off.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Zhang Qun Has Not Come to Shanghai <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Fan Chongshi Entered Beijing the Night Before Last</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Zhang Qun has not yet entered Sichuan as a special commissioner because the measures for reorganizing Sichuan Province are still awaiting approval from the Central Political Conference, and the generals in Sichuan have not been thoroughly enlightened. It was said that Mr. Zhang had arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. In recent days, reporters have visited Zhang's residence on Avenue Albert and learned that Mr. Zhang has not returned to Shanghai. A certain gentleman from the municipal government telephoned Zhang's residence last night and learned that Mr. Zhang was still in Beijing yesterday. Multiple sources prove that Mr. Zhang's arrival in Shanghai yesterday morning is indeed inaccurate. As for Fan Chongshi, the Shanghai representative of Liu Xiang, it is reported that he took the night express train to Beijing the night before last to discuss the aftermath of Sichuan Province.</p>

<p>Dalian Company Cancels Shanghai Route</p>
<p>Military Industry Comes to Shanghai: After the construction of the new barracks for the Japanese Naval Landing Forces in Shanghai, Chief Commander Sugisaka telegraphed the Naval Ministry, requesting the addition of an armory in Shanghai dedicated to manufacturing and repair.

Carrying machinery parts for manufacturing weapons, they arrived in Shanghai by Japanese ship today. Major General Sugisaka has dispatched them to the new barracks in Hongkou to install the machinery, which will be dedicated to repairing and manufacturing military supplies for the Japanese Navy in Shanghai and the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Transport: Since the outbreak of the hot war, Japanese ships from Dalian Kisen and Tianjin will, from this day forward, change to the Dalian-Tianjin route, canceling the Shanghai route and being assigned for transportation during the military period. They will also be prepared to provide transportation to Dalian for Japanese residents in Peiping and Tianjin when they evacuate if necessary.

<p>The Municipal Council Expresses Approval in Principle</p>
<p>Other Opinions Will Be Responded to in Writing</p>
<p>Regarding the municipal government's inspection of factories in the concessions, this morning, according to Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, in order to implement the factory inspection of the Factory Law promulgated by the central government, the concession side has not yet implemented it due to unresolved negotiations. Recently, I again met with Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, and stated that the municipal government urgently needs to start inspecting the factories in the concessions. Mr. Fessenden expressed support for the principle of inspecting factories, but the Municipal Council also had opinions to express and promised to respond in writing in the shortest possible time. No response has been received yet. The content will be studied after the response is received, and a decision will be made on future procedures. As for the tragic case of the Zhengtai Rubber Factory, it is said that the factory has offered compensation of 300 yuan per victimized worker. The resolution of this matter may not be so simple. The cause of the disaster should be investigated first, and then the issue of compensation should be considered. As for the issues of building roads beyond the boundary and promoting the new system of weights and measures in the concessions, they are all in active progress.</p>

<p>The Central Guoshu Institute was established in 1928 and has been in operation for five years. The museum is currently preparing to hold a five-year anniversary celebration and plans to film the national arts performance and send it to the Chicago Exposition for screening.

It is now actively preparing to be held in Beijing in late March. As for the upcoming Chicago Exposition in the United States, the Central Guoshu Institute originally planned to send personnel to participate, but because the round-trip travel expenses are very high, it has now been decided to film the national arts performance and send it to the conference for screening.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Jiangsu Rice Association Asks to Stop the Rice Transport Strike <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Ninghu Municipal and County Rice Industry Association held its 16th standing meeting of the second session at Zuo Xiutang yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Because not enough members from various counties attended, the quorum was not met, and it was changed to a discussion meeting. Chairman Zhao Zixin reported that the strike in Shanghai had not been resolved, which was very unfortunate. At present, it is heard that there are more than 100 rice boats carrying rice from the interior to Shanghai that have been blocked on the way. Over time, it is feared that the rice will overheat. Moreover, Shanghai's rice supply depends on the interior. If this continues, it is feared that there will be a panic in the people's food supply, which will have a significant impact on social safety and stability. It is appropriate to request the authorities not to condone it any further and to strictly stop it to prevent the matter from expanding and hindering the people's food supply. It was publicly decided to request the Social Bureau to stop it immediately. In addition, the Changshu County Chamber of Commerce sent a letter requesting that the dispute over the price of rice be banned. It has been forwarded to the Bean and Rice Industry Association for reply and will be replied to by the association later.</p>

<p>Secret Hand-Off in the Urinal</p>
<p>Customer Turns Out to Be Detective</p>
<p>Detective Hua Men of the Huishi Patrol Room received a report from an informant a few days ago stating that a Westerner was secretly selling handguns in the Dadong Hotel on Yinghua Street. He sent Detective Deng Shu to pretend to be a customer and secretly contacted the Westerner once. He stated that each handgun and 100 bullets would cost 220 yuan and agreed to exchange the money on the 25th of this month. On the due date, Chinese and Western detectives waited in the billiard room upstairs in the Dadong Hotel. As expected, the Westerner was already there. Detective Deng immediately went up to greet him and then went to the urinal together. The Westerner immediately took out an [A. C. Tirera] brand handgun, one hundred bullets, and a bullet case from his side and handed them to the Chinese detective. The Western detective Hua Men immediately arrested him and took him to the patrol room. After questioning, his name was [Isique Gestin], age 30, a Brazilian. He was ordered to be detained. This morning, he was escorted to the 8th Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Patrol Room lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that he was currently prosecuting the defendant under Article 201, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, but all the guns and bullets had not yet been sent to the Council for verification, so he requested a postponement. According to the Chinese and Western detectives' complaint, the defendant confessed that the matter was done by another Westerner, Si Huituo. After Judge Qian Wenqi verified the confession, he instructed that the defendant Isique Gestin be detained pending rescheduling of the trial next Friday.</p>

<p>Both Sentenced to Remand Pending Investigation and Retrial</p>
<p>Hongkou Patrol Room Detective Chief Wei Jinfu, Detectives Yang Zhaoqing, Liu Zhaonian, Wang Runhe, and Detective Zhang Faxiang learned that robbers were hiding in a house at No. 25 Ximen Road, French Concession. Yesterday morning, they cooperated with Western detectives and French patrol room detectives to secretly arrest Shao Xing native Rong Ahai and local Zheng Ruiying. They confessed that there were still robbers at No. 276 Hede Road. They also arrested Shao Xing native Tang Agen, Ningbo native Xu Changgen, Cai Xiangyun, and woman Li Cai Shi and seized two handguns and fifteen bullets. They were all taken back to the patrol room and detained separately. This morning, they were escorted to the 3rd Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Patrol Room lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the previous situation and stated that the two handguns were loaded with bullets and it was not known where they were going to rob. He requested that they be detained temporarily to investigate the defendants' crimes and that the handguns be submitted for inspection. After Judge Wu Zehan briefly questioned the defendants Rong and others, he instructed that they still be remanded separately and rescheduled for investigation and trial. Also, Huishan Patrol Room Detectives Liu Baoshan and Yin Zhanqing and Western Detective Watson arrested robbers Changshu native Wei Shixiang, Wuxi native Zhang Fugeng, Danyang native Zhou Tonghai, Shanghai native Hu Shanqing, and Chongming native A Liu and five others yesterday afternoon at Shenzhou Hotel at No. 159 Zhejiang Road, China Hotel at No. 91 Jiujiang Road, and Zhongnan Hotel on Beijing Road. They seized two fake handguns and brought them back to the patrol room. Today, they were escorted to the 3rd Criminal Division. Patrol Room lawyer Zhang stated that after investigating, the defendants had one case of intimidation and two cases of theft. Because the names and locations of the victims were not yet clear, he requested a postponement. Judge Wu instructed that they all be remanded and rescheduled for verification and seizure.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Some Overbearing Soldiers in Japan (Tokyo Correspondence) <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese people's worship of soldiers and belief in force probably began with the Russo-Japanese War. At that time, Japan, an island country, defeated Russia, which dominated the Eurasian continent. Its heroic image can be imagined. This is the general reason why Japanese warlords were able to be overbearing and militarism was able to become the belief center of the entire nation. Therefore, Japanese soldiers became a special class among the people of the whole country. The backgrounds and deeds of army figures such as Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in, Minister of the Army Araki Sadao, Director General of Education Hayashi Senjuro, Director of Army Aviation Watanabe Jotaro, Director of Army Technology Ogata Katsuichi, and Commander of the Kwantung Army Muto Nobuyoshi are already familiar to the world, so there is no need to say more. Now we want to briefly talk about the secondary army figures in the Japanese military.</p>
<p>(1) Graduates of the 9th Class of the Military Academy</p>
<p>Graduates of the 9th class of the Japanese Army Military Academy have a special advantage in the military. For example, Lieutenant Generals Masaki, Honjo, Abe, Matsui, Araki, Hayashi, Yamamoto, and others all hold important positions and are important figures in the Japanese Army and are recognized as the dominating figures in the future army. Masaki Jinzaburo, former Commander of the Taiwan Army and currently Vice Chief of Staff, is said to be able to be promoted to general this year. In the near future, he will surely be honored as Chief of Staff. Honjo Shigeru, the notorious creator of the September 18th Incident and the incubator of [Manchukuo], formerly Commander of the Kwantung Army. Last July, he was transferred back to the country and appointed Military Councilor. He will surely be promoted to general this year and will also be a major figure in the Japanese military in the future. Abe Nobuyuki, currently Commander of the Taiwan Army, served as [Minister Without Portfolio] during the Hamaguchi Cabinet. During the illness of Army Minister Ugaki, he served as Acting Army Minister, and he can be said to be the actual Army Minister. Since the retirement of General Ugaki, Abe should be the successor of that faction. Abe is one of the most powerful candidates for Army Minister in the near future. Matsui Ishigen was the Japanese Plenipotentiary Representative sent to Geneva to participate in the Disarmament Conference and served as the Second Department Chief of the General Staff Headquarters and the Commander of the 11th Division.</p>
<p>(2) Future Talents of the General Staff Headquarters</p>
<p>Major General Umezu Yoshijiro, Chief of the General Affairs Department of the General Staff Headquarters, is a graduate of the 15th class of the Military Academy. He graduated first in his class from Kumamoto Army Elementary School when he was young. Major General Furushō Mikio, Chief of the First Department, was the first graduate of the 14th class. Major General Nagata Tetsuzan, Chief of the Second Department, served as the Chief of the Military Affairs Section of the Army Ministry and personally observed the general mobilization measures of various countries during the European War. He is now regarded by the Japanese as an expert in the Japanese national general mobilization plan. Major General Ogawa Toshishiro, Chief of the Third Department, is known as [Army Minister Araki's confidant] and is expected to be the future Chief of Staff. Major General Nishio Toshizo, Chief of the Fourth Department, is a graduate of the 14th class of the Military Academy. He served as the Chief of the First Section of the Education Directorate and has a deep understanding of military education. He is quite hopeful of becoming the next Director of Education. The above five people are important and promising talents in the General Staff Headquarters.</p>
<p>(3) Future Talents of the Naval General Staff</p>
<p>Vice Admiral Yanagawa Heisuke, Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff, is from the cavalry department of the 17th class of the Military Academy and is the most trusted figure of Army Minister Araki. Major General Yamaoka Juatsu, Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau, is, like Vice Chief Yanagawa, a person who was specially promoted and reused by Mr. Araki. Yamaoka was on the staff of Nogi's army during the Russo-Japanese War. The Japanese praised him for succeeding Tanaka Giichi, Ugaki Kazunari, Tata Hitaro, Abe Nobuyuki, and Sugiyama Gen as a [soldier with a politician's mind]. He first served as the Chief of the Second Section of the Education Directorate and then as the Brigade Commander of the First Infantry Brigade. When Army Minister Araki took office, he was awarded the important position of Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau. Colonel Yamashita Tomoyuki, Chief of the Military Affairs Section of the famous Army Ministry for a time, is a graduate of the 18th class. Finally, we must also mention the head of the press group, Colonel Honma Masaharu. Since the establishment of the press group, he has been promoted as the first head of the group, and he is likely to develop greatly in military and political aspects in the future.</p>
<p>(4) Future Talents of the Education Directorate</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Kashii Kohei, Director of the Education Directorate, is a graduate of the 12th class of the Military Academy and the former Commander of the Japanese Army in North China. He was the instigator of the Tianjin Incident. According to the usual Japanese custom, after serving as the Director of the Education Directorate, they will soon take over the great power, such as Ugaki Kazunari, Kishimoto Shikatarō, Hayashi Senjuro, and Araki Sadao, which are its precedents. Therefore, Kashii's promotion will inevitably be no exception. Lieutenant General Tada Shunroku, Chief of Artillery, graduated in the same year as Kashii. Although his current position is still low, his future is absolutely hopeful. He is the younger brother of the late Dada Hitaro. From the artillery department, he has served as the Brigade Commander of the 4th Field Heavy Artillery Brigade and the Chief of the 4th and 1st Departments of the General Staff Headquarters. He is a military strategist and one of the few famous generals in the Education Directorate. In the near future, he will also be promoted to Vice Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>(5) Generals in Battle</p>
<p>Among the division commanders of the Japanese Army, Lieutenant General Niiya Harushige, Commander of the 5th Division, is the most famous. Niiya served as Vice Chief of Staff and Chief of the General Affairs Department of the General Staff Headquarters. He is a graduate of the 12th class of the Military Academy and an outstanding talent of the General Staff Headquarters. During the transition of the Ugaki system, he was at his post in Hiroshima, and then he was transferred to work in the Ministry. Lieutenant General Sugiyama Gen, Commander of the 12th Division, graduated from the Military Academy in the same year as Niiya. He served as the Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau and the Vice Minister of the Army. When the Ugaki system was handed over, he had already taken office as the division commander, and he is quite hopeful of becoming an attendant military officer or the Director of Education. Lieutenant General Koiso Kuniaki, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, is a graduate of the 12th class. During the Saito Cabinet, Araki recognized him and promoted him to Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau. Later, when Muto took office as the Commander of the Kwantung Army, Koiso was promoted to Chief of Staff. Major General Okamura Yasuji, a graduate of the 16th class of the Military Academy. During the Shanghai Incident, General Shirakawa was ordered to serve as the Commander of the Shanghai Expeditionary Force, and Okamura was promoted to Deputy Chief of Staff. Colonel Saito Yūhei, currently a senior staff officer, may have great development in the Japanese Army in the future. The above five people are regarded by the Japanese military as outstanding talents in the battlefield.</p>
<p>In addition, there is Lieutenant General Tatekawa Yoshitsugu, who served as the Chief of the 1st Department of the General Staff Headquarters and was later sent to Geneva to attend the Disarmament Conference as a military representative. Today, all Japanese people regard him as an outstanding talent dispatched overseas.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Echoes of Promoting Female Police Officers <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>Since various newspapers published the news that "the Ministry of Interior Affairs on the 16th issued a consultation to provincial governments requesting the promotion of female police officers," a group of people who view women with a special "X-ray" perspective were even more astonished than they were a few years ago when they suddenly heard the news of women taking the county magistrate examination. Because women taking the county magistrate examination was an unprecedented innovation, let's leave that aside for now, but when they take office, according to the regulations on addressing county officials as "Your Honor," how should the common people address them? And how should they address "him"? This had already perplexed these people. Now, the issue of promoting female police officers, although it follows in the footsteps of Europe and America, ultimately feels like it has flown in from outer space in our esteemed country. How can it not cause them great alarm?</p>
<p>In reality, the wheel of progress, which adapts to the needs of society and conforms to the trends of the world, will not stop because of some reactionary forces. Upon hearing this news, some young people in the female community openly discussed it with excitement, reaching the conclusion: "If we're going to do it, let's join the volunteer army so that we can kill the enemy like the soldiers on the front lines!" What heroic words that liberate the female community. Hearing them, one cannot help but feel a sense of "The wind is howling, the Yi River is cold!"</p>
<p>China's population is said to be 470 million, but in reality, if half of the female compatriots do not unanimously arm themselves with a shared hatred for the enemy, then will the slogan of "national mobilization to jointly face national crisis" not turn into "national semi-mobilization"?</p>
<p>If we flip through ancient national history, for example, Mulan's twelve years of military service, the Tang Dynasty Princess Pingyang's "Women's Army" that helped Emperor Taizong secure the empire, Liang Hongyu's personal drumming to assist in battle and sharing labor with soldiers, and Qin Liangyu's courage, horsemanship, archery, and repeated suppression of rebellions, these are all brilliantly recorded female war achievements that have become beautiful tales throughout the ages. As for the news of a nameless female general riding a white horse in the Northeast Volunteer Army last year who fought bravely and died, it is also well-known in the world. That is even more proof that meritorious service is not exclusive to men, and even women can courageously kill the enemy!</p>
<p>"If we're going to do it, let's join the volunteer army so that we can kill the enemy like the soldiers on the front lines!" Under this slogan of sorrowful and heroic spirit, enough to shake mountains and rivers, many other ambitious young women should rise up in response, immediately go to the front lines to do practical work, or organize ambulance teams. We should prepare sacrificial lambs and fine wine to sincerely send them off on their heroic journey!</p>

<p>A poet wrote this motto on his desk: "Woman is a snake, I shall cast her into the sea." An erotic maniac wrote next to that motto: "Woman is a treasure, I shall embrace her in my bosom."</p>
<p>A heartbroken person said angrily:</p>
<p>"Is it really that women are so lovely, that love is so sweet, that one must offer gold and kneel down to purchase it?... I don't believe there are so many foolish people in this world who are always happy to chain themselves into slavery and love those money-worshiping women..."</p>

<p>A notice posted in front of the gymnasium of the "University Hall" reads: "Those wearing leather shoes are not allowed to enter." After this dignified notice was posted, the result was: the male students obediently measured themselves before running into the gymnasium to see if they had changed into flat shoes. As for the princesses in the Eastern Palace? They have not yet given up their high heels. Alas! Same leather shoes, two different views, what injustice in the world is greater than this?</p>

<p>— Mizu</p>
<p>The God of Spring drove away the severe cold of the remaining winter. On the ground and branches, one can faintly see tender green buds and thin grass, and the warm breeze brings infinite vitality.</p>
<p>Yi Palace, surrounded by the atmosphere of spring, appears particularly inviting.</p>
<p>In front of it, there is a wide road. Short holly trees, as green as oil, stand on both sides of the road. Facing the palace gate, there is a cluster of small trees. Not far to the left, there is a wisteria trellis. The trellis is so long, with a thatched pavilion built in the center of the corridor. Some couples whisper sweet words here, and some discuss academic papers together.</p>
<p>The architecture of Yi Palace is very novel. Its overall shape resembles a concave character. The three-story Western-style buildings are all painted in goose yellow. Viewed in the morning light or evening glow, each has different colors. Especially at night, the neat rows of electric lights illuminate it so brilliantly. Seen from the incomplete Yi Yi Road piled with sand and dust, it is truly like a jade palace in the sky.</p>
<p>Inside the concave shape, there is a flat platform. Three sides of the platform have bamboo fences, and wisteria vines climb on the bamboo fences. Red, yellow, and purple flowers bloom very adorably, especially during the late spring and autumn seasons.</p>
<p>Entering through the palace gate, the reception desk is on the right. The entrance to the reception desk and the wall opposite it are covered with colorful notices, announcements, declarations, or book introductions, interspersed with small notes for lost items waiting to be claimed, or urgent meeting convocations regarding the Japanese pirates.</p>
<p>Further inside is the reception room. There are corridors on both sides. The clear steel windows provide ample light. The curtains covering the windows are half-open and half-closed. In the middle of the room, there is a large round table, surrounded by many chairs. In the four corners, there are four rattan round tables, each surrounded by four rattan chairs. Every day after 5 pm, or on Sundays and Saturday afternoons, there is probably not a single empty chair in the reception room.</p>
<p>At one point, many students proposed to open it, but they were still disappointed.</p>

<p>Spring in Shanghai, youthful flames are active in the oblique, cold wind.</p>
<p>The night of the city, the pursuit of red lights and flesh. I was sent from the dreamlike Risheng Building to Guizhou Road. Groups of urban animals were sent into the pleasure exchange under the jade-like white thighs of beauties.</p>
<p>Dance, spread its wings of temptation wide, casting mysterious glances at everyone. The performance of flesh, as if animated, jumped out of the glass cabinet, grabbing the souls of passersby.</p>
<p>The alternation of Peerka and Xitelin, the high-heeled shoes covered by long cheongsams, accompanied by the pointed leather shoes of 1933. Groups and teams were sent in under the jade-like white thighs of beauties.</p>
<p>I was stuffed in the crowd, forgetting myself. Dance, the performance of flesh. I subconsciously reached into the pocket of my worn-out suit. The red lights extinguished their radiance. The urban animals turned into the black velvet door. The "eight corners" under the ticket booth had not lost their authority; and at the same time, the brass frame of "full upstairs and downstairs" also reflected in my eyes.</p>
<p>The servant in the royal uniform gave me a weak glance, like surprise, like contempt, lightly whispering to each other.</p>
<p>Ghostly music came from a very far place. I glanced at the jade-like white thighs of the beauties for the last time, and hurriedly fled out.</p>
<p>A monster drove from afar, spitting out four high-nosed pointed men who were drunk, or rather, intoxicated by wine. A gust of wind was swallowed into the jade-like white</p>

<p>thighs of beauties.</p>
<p>I was sent to the Risheng Building in a dreamlike state. A group of ghosts whose original faces were concealed by white powder sang pitiful songs under the red lights. Suddenly, one running westward did not stay, and the slaves who lost their motherland were sent in through the sound of huge leather shoes.</p>
<p>The night of the city, the pursuit of red lights and flesh.</p>

<p>— Sheng Hong</p>
<p>Alas; Shanghai is really a place where there are no wonders, and countless dark curtains emerge. Just taking the advertisement as a layer, it is enough to make me, a newcomer, be greatly deceived.</p>
<p>The fact is like this. This semester, due to various difficulties, I had to temporarily drop out of school and study at home. However, studying at home is of course not able to satisfy my desire for academics. Therefore, I planned to enroll in night school to specialize. Just imagine, Shanghai is so big, and the establishment of night schools is like bamboo shoots after the rain. Night school recruitment advertisements almost occupy the entire page in major newspaper advertising columns. Perhaps this is the popularization of Chinese education. These advertisements really speak like flowers falling from the sky, greatly praising themselves. To tear down the magic mirror, they are nothing more than high-class wild chickens. At first, I carefully looked around, and no school made me feel quite satisfied. Suddenly, an advertisement as big as a teacup attracted me: "Western 囗囗 English Special Night School" Next to it, a small line of attached notice was: "This school hires the current 囗囗" University professor, Western 囗囗, PhD as 囗-level professor" This is amazing. A night school would pay such a price to hire Professor 囗囗, PhD from University 囗囗 as a professor. That would naturally arouse my great attention. So, I immediately asked for a copy of the regulations to read carefully. This copy of the regulations, of course, said it like flowers falling from the sky, greatly boasting and drumming up, just like the advertisement. The tuition fee is only 18 yuan per semester, and the time is two hours every night. The books made me feel very satisfied. In this way, I resolutely paid the tuition fee and bought the books, and went to school the next night to attend classes.</p>
<p>The teacher on the first night was Cantonese. I was greatly shocked in my heart. Who knew I waited two nights, two nights, three nights, and the dreamed-of Western Professor 囗囗, PhD from University 囗囗 was like a needle sinking into the sea, and there was no news forever, and the time was also greatly wrong. The teacher was late to school until 7:20, and was full of "damn," and dismissed the class at 8:25, which was the opposite of the "two hours every night" stated in the regulations.</p>
<p>"Sir, who is the Doctor 囗囗" mentioned in your school's regulations? Also, the books mentioned in the regulations include Composition and Essay, Nest</p>
<p>Lied Grammar lv, Vicar of Wackfield,</p>
<p>and what else has not been taught?" One night, I could no longer bear it and questioned the Dean of Academic Affairs in this way.</p>

<p>— Lin Lanmei</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am a weak woman, 20 years of age. I also studied in elementary school for a few years, but due to economic reasons, I couldn't go on to higher education, and I'm always at home taking care of housework. Every time I think about finding something to do; either the location is too bad, with the risk of being insulted, so I'm unwilling to compromise myself, or their qualifications are too high, such as a university degree, a middle school degree, etc., rejecting me from a thousand miles away. There are two parents in my family who are over 60 years old, with no older siblings above and no younger siblings below, and no one to rely on. In this era of high cost of living, I feel very acute pressure every day. If I think about the future of the three of us who depend on each other for life, it really makes you restless! Seeing those leisurely people enjoying themselves every day, how can I not be both envious and jealous?</p>
<p>The year before last, through a classmate's introduction, I met a Mr. Luo. He fits my ideal very well and loves me very much. He once proposed to me, and at that time, I was willing in my heart, but thinking about "Without me, what would my parents do for the rest of their years?", I was speechless, and tears fell like rain. He was confused, and after repeated questioning, I had to tell him sincerely: I said, "I myself have no conditions, the most important thing is, are you willing to take care of my parents in the end?" Hearing these words, his face was troubled, and after a long pause, he said, "Unfortunately, I am also a man with a hard life, and my monthly salary is very limited; I also have an old mother and a weak younger sibling who rely on me to support them." Therefore, our marriage had to be painfully severed. Since then, he has often said, "I hope that my monthly income will one day increase to a considerable amount, and we can still get married." Now? Because he couldn't resist his old mother's opinion, he married another woman last winter. Hearing this news, I felt like a prisoner hearing the judge announce his death sentence in court, and I couldn't express my suffering. Until now, Mr. Luo still often sends letters to comfort me and advise me not to be too sad; but I, the more I'm advised, the more heartbroken I become. Alas!</p>
<p>Dear Editor, people are born equal, and I haven't done anything wrong, why do I have to suffer so much? Is it really a matter of a previous life? (omitted below)</p>
<p>Sincerely, Lin Lanmei</p>
<p>Editor's Note: After reading Ms. Lin's letter, you can't help but feel a sourness in your nose; her life is so pitiful. Therefore, even though she is not a shop employee, worker, or apprentice, we have to discuss it publicly here.</p>
<p>It is true that "people are born equal." However, this is "a kind of proposition, opinion, ideal only. Ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign," has never been realized. Some people are born rich and noble, and some people are born poor and lowly. But this is definitely not a matter of a previous life, it is caused by the evil capitalism. We demand equality, and blaming heaven and earth is useless. We should attack this evil society, that is the way out.</p>
<p>Ms. Lin's standard for choosing a husband is to find a man who can take care of her parents to the end, which is difficult! Now the cost of living is getting higher every day, and a man who supports a wife is already covered in sweat, so "the call for women to have the ability to be independent" can be heard everywhere; how can they still have the ability to take care of your parents? It is your filial piety to support your parents, which is admirable, but you can only offer your own mental strength to fulfill this wish. In today's society, it is really not easy to find a husband to take care of your parents! Even if there are some wealthy young masters who can take on this responsibility, then you will inevitably be angry for life! As for women's occupations, some of course require considerable qualifications, but there are also some that do not require very profound knowledge. Speaking of some positions, although there is a risk of being insulted, as long as you are firm, you are not afraid. So, we advise Ms. Lin to quickly find something to do and use the price she gets to support her parents. Marriage is another issue. Don't mix the issue of supporting parents into it. Mr. Luo already has a wife, and it's impossible to salvage; but a second Mr. Luo is not difficult to find again, so there is no need to be too sad. I don't know if this advice will make you even more heartbroken!</p>

<p>— Written by Ed Falkowiki, Abridged and Translated by Zhixiang</p>
<p>"Don't talk like that, Peter. We've lived here for a long time. Now, where can we go?"</p>
<p>Peter remained silent. He placed his cold pipe in the iron ashtray.</p>
<p>You are right, Mary! In all respects, I show the appearance of old age; tonight, I have dressed up to go out. It's been a long time since I last met my companions. It's Saturday night, and I want to go out and have some fun, no matter what."</p>
<p>Although smoking is forbidden, drinking is still allowed. Everyone at home can drink as much as they want! Or they can increase it at will!</p>
<p>The Jiggai Cafe on Sino-Western Street is often frequented by people. It seems to boast of exclusive business. The next room is full of traveling salesmen, private wine merchants, and painted prostitutes. They are all trying to have fun as much as possible.</p>
<p>The managers and foremen in the mines drink in the Peisike shop on Coal Street. Merchants who contract materials in the mines come there to invite foremen to eat and drink, and they won't blame the merchants for wasting. They like such waste. We should know that this is the secret to doing business! Entertainment expenses are equal to investment in sales. If you are willing to waste like this, you can win the favor of the managers, and their favor is the price of increasing the value of various materials.</p>
<p>The workers often live in the tunnels of the mines. There, they fight desperately with the ore, and the reward they get is only some coal. How would they know that this Peisike shop, poor workers! How many eras will it take for a worker to become an intellectual in America!</p>
<p>Notice</p>
<p>Regarding the Coal Hill novel, on the previous two days, the signature "Sui" was actually a misunderstanding, and there are also places in the original text that have been deleted, so now it has been changed to "Translated and interpreted by Zhixiang," and this is specifically stated;</p>

<p>— Huang Junru</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Grand Theatre screened the Soviet sound film "Road to Life" this time, it has aroused the Sensafi of the general public in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The reason for this is not only because the film has a unique style, which is different from the American film style that has always advocated hedonism, but also because it can point out the way forward in life. But what is the current state of the film industry in the Soviet Union, and what is the situation of Soviet films exported abroad? I think this must also be something that the general public is eager to know. Therefore, I will briefly introduce its situation below:</p>
<p>(1) The Soviet Film New Five-Year Plan</p>
<p>Filmification, along with electrification, chemicalization, and automobilization, are all the main slogans of the current Soviet Union. Last year, the number of times Soviet residents watched movies averaged ten times per person. If we discuss it separately in urban and rural areas, it is 21 times in urban areas and 5-6 times in rural areas. In order to make the people closer to movies, the Soviet government plans to universalize the film network in the Second Five-Year Plan. It is expected to triple the number of cinemas in the Russian Republic, paying special attention to the areas of small and medium-sized ethnic groups, such as the Central Asian Kazakhstan within the Republic, which will increase the number of cinemas by six and a half times; newly established 42,244 film clubs; state-owned agricultural centers, etc., building 310 of the latest modern movie theaters; labor farmers' clubs, etc., all equipped with film projectors. It is estimated that in 1937, the final year of the Second Five-Year Plan, the total number of movie viewers in the entire Federation will reach 3 billion. The number of viewers will be 48 times per adult, which is compared with the end of the First Five-Year Plan as follows: 1932 1937</p>
<p>City 21 times 56 times</p>
<p>Rural 5-6 times 41 times</p>
<p>It can be seen from this that the Second Five-Year Plan is not only to increase the number of viewers from an average of 10 times to 48 times, but also to gradually bring the number of viewers closer together in urban and rural areas. (2) The Soviet Union's Film Export Volume</p>
<p>Although Soviet films are quite popular with audiences in various countries due to their unique themes and techniques, they cannot obtain the freedom of public import due to the ideological content often touching the taboos of censorship in various countries; and because the rental fees are quite high, the export volume has not yet reached the maximum number. Last year, from January to September, its export volume was only 59,000 rubles (weight 2 tons), an increase of 25,000 rubles compared to 34,000 rubles (weight 1 ton) in 1931.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Director Bao Caiqi's [Love in the Battlefield] <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Shenghong</p>
<p>Indeed, Frank Bao Caiqi's [Seventh Heaven] made a profound impression on people around the world. As a result, he was elected as one of the world's top ten directors in 1931.</p>
<p>A few years ago, in response to the enthusiastic demands of movie fans around the world, he began directing [Love in the Battlefield], (A Farewell to Arms). The plot, like [Seventh Heaven], is full of sorrow and allure, with a touch of the color of the Russian literary giant Tolstoy's masterpiece [Resurrection]. The film depicts the sorrow of life's separations very deeply, and the whole film is immersed in sad music and melancholic emotions.</p>
<p>Regarding the leading role, Frank Bao Caiqi carefully selected the actors, as cautiously as Lubitsch selected the leading roles for [The Merry Widow]. As a result, Helen Hayes, who won the Academy Award for Best Actress the year before last, was selected. The male lead is the veteran star Gary Cooper, with Adolphe Menjou. The plot is so mournful, lingering, and tearful, truly touching people's hearts. The general idea is about a military officer who meets a young woman in a certain village, and they fall in love that night. Soon after, the officer goes to the front line to fight, and the woman gives birth to a child at home, who unfortunately dies young. The woman waits for the officer to return, but there is no news. The woman becomes ill from accumulated worry, and is on her deathbed. At this time, the officer suddenly returns from the front line. The woman only slightly opens her almond eyes at the moment of parting, giving the officer a slight bitter smile, and her fragrant soul flutters away. It is truly [Heaven and earth may pass away, but this sorrow will last forever]!</p>
<h3 id="e228">Further Introduction to [A Pair of Ill-Fated Lovers] <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Ping Chen</p>
<p>Coming Soon to the New Guang Theater</p>
<p>Chinese people embrace familism, and their concern for succession is particularly strong. They often scrimp and save, working hard all their lives like beasts of burden, to leave this property for their children and grandchildren to use. Such people are truly foolish!</p>
<p>The Japanese have invaded Yuguan, and the volunteer army is desperately fighting, enduring hunger and cold. The plight of the refugees from the Northeast is completely irrelevant to the wealthy. They are preparing to pass on their huge family fortunes to their children and grandchildren, and are unwilling to donate even a little to the volunteer army or refugees. As for whether their children and grandchildren will be spendthrifts or slaves to a conquered nation in the future, they will not think about it!</p>
<p>Tianyi Film Company's new sound production [A Pair of Ill-Fated Lovers], its central idea is to depict the evils of inheritance. It clearly tells us that inheritance for children is [not only useless but also harmful]. At the same time, it also tells us that the wealthy should use their wealth to establish social enterprises to benefit the masses.</p>
<p>[A Pair of Ill-Fated Lovers] is a realistic depiction, a powerful film aimed at the ills of Chinese society. Another point worth mentioning is that several of the sets in [A Pair of Ill-Fated Lovers] are indeed worthy of the description [magnificent and luxurious].</p>
<p>Jiang Qing, Returned from Hollywood</p>
<p>The roles played by Mary Doran in Hollywood are those of kind old women, so everyone calls her [Mother on the Screen]. But she has been in the industry for more than 20 years, and many people expect her to retire soon.</p>
<p>Jackie Coogan is known as a child prodigy, but he is very naughty. Once, he cut many small holes in his newly made shirt, but he wore it to the streets. This is one page of his humorous history. However, he has been much quieter recently, because he has declared that he will withdraw from the film industry and go to state university.</p>
<p>Mary Pickford cut her golden long hair three years ago and turned it into a curly style, which she felt was very suitable for a young woman's dress.</p>
<p>Douglas Fairbanks loves to practice hunting and shooting. Whenever he is drunk, he always talks about his martial arts skills. He has recently traveled the world, his footprints all over the world. The American Film Institute selected him as the star who traveled the most in 1932.</p>
<p>After Charlie Chaplin's [City Lights] was released, he still firmly adhered to his film production principles. He is very interested in shooting a film about [Napoleon Bonaparte], but it is still undecided. He may still serve as the screenwriter, director, and leading actor himself.</p>
<p>Charlie Farrell's only hobby is collecting old things, stamps, old coins, treasures, and the like. He also likes Chinese embroidery very much. He said that the Chinese are very easy to trade with.</p>
<p>Anna May Wong, a Chinese actress, is touring Europe. She seems to be tired of her film career. When someone asked her if she would return to her motherland, she just smiled.</p>
<p>A scene from Tianyi Film Company's new sound film [A Pair of Ill-Fated Lovers]</p>
<h3 id="e229">Talking about Li Lili <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Presumably everyone knows that the new stars in the film industry,</p>
<p>Wang Renmei and Li Lili are the mainstays of the Bright Moon Troupe!</p>
<p>When they performed on stage at the Bright Moon Troupe, I wrote some articles, which may have contained some opportunistic elements!</p>
<p>She!! Li Lili!! was born in Beiping. She can speak very clear and fluent Mandarin. When she was twelve years old, she came to Shanghai from Beiping to seek her new life. At that time, she worshiped Li Jinhui as her adoptive father. Her real surname is Qian, and her father, Qian Zhuzhuang, is a doctor in Beiping. She only changed her surname to Li after becoming Li Jinhui's adopted daughter. As for why she doesn't have the surname Qian, that is a mysterious matter.</p>
<p>She and Wang Renmei were recruited by the United China Singing and Dancing Troupe at the same time. When the United China Singing and Dancing Troupe performed publicly, she met us several times. Last year, when the United China Singing and Dancing Troupe disbanded, she also followed Wang Renmei's example and appeared on the screen. Her debut work was [Blood of Love in the Volcano]. After the release of this film, she got the nickname [Beauty Essence] (which is opposed to Wang Renmei's nickname [Beauty King]). Later, some people called her [Sweetheart]. Her second film in United China was the recently released [Dawn]. But all of these were silent films. We heard her sweet voice on the screen only from Tianyi's [Poetry on the Banana Plant].</p>
<p>She is only eighteen years old this year, which is the age of a young woman.</p>
