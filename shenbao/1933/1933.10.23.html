<p>據今日表示、美總統與李維諾夫之初步討論、倘能肅清荆棘、即能進而接洽商約、惟美國商人之債權要求、必須先行考慮、然後方能切實討論商約細目也、（廿一日國民電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄大爲興奮　希望獲到三重結果</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）　蘇俄全國聞美國將予以承認之消息、大爲興奮、蘇俄領袖今日聲稱、俄國希望美俄復交有三重結果、即（一）借債便利之大增、（二）美國對若干俄貨障碍之撤銷、（三）蘇俄對日遠東地位之鞏固、是蘇俄確信世界經濟情形、已造成對美談判之地位、如美國願作貿易、蘇俄將詢問恢復大宗貿易之條件、所謂條件者、無非依允充分的賒賬、俾蘇俄可向美國採辦及撤銷美國對俄貨之限制耳（二十二路透）</p>
<h3>日本精神上受打擊　軍事當局故示鎭定</h3>
<p>（東京）　美國承認蘇聯之問題、將踏入具體階段、荒木陸相對於此事之觀察、其所談如左、「美國承認蘇聯、或能成爲事實、亦未可料、但日本對於此案、當處之以泰然自若之態度、並無任何左顧右盼之必要」云、又日本陸軍當局之觀察、其大體如左、「關於美國承認蘇聯之眞相尚未明瞭、故對於見解之批評、當屬困難、美國欲使蘇俄承認其克倫斯基時代之戰債而促其償還、蘇俄倘承認之、則日本亦有數億之戰債、可於東鐵購受之問題、可藉此得到容易之解决策、但蘇俄恐不易概然承認也、若美國放棄蘇俄之戰債、則歐洲各國之戰債亦當倣傚其辦法關於此點則承認更不易實行、且美國國内之卸職軍人與夫其團體、皆表示倔强之反對、欲使此案通過議會尤感困難、但美國處於未曾有之恐慌中、其希望擴張貿易市塲之心甚形急迫、故促其承認蘇俄、此種空氣亦在所不免、唯承認時期不至如是迫切而即行决定也、對於日本出其牽制手段、亦不無蛛絲馬跡之可尋、縱令實現、其承認方略、則直至今日而未承認者、反爲不可思議之情形矣、在日本不過微受其精神上之打擊耳、至謂日本因此而深領任何影響、則爲淺見者之推想而巳」云云、（二十二日日聯電）</p>
<h3>復交前途樂觀　大可增進兩國貿易　國會核准可無疑義</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　蘇俄代表急欲前來白宫、而此間官場亦期望迅速承認蘇俄、俾可增進俄美貿易、據非官場之可恃消息、俄外長李維諾夫在兩星期内或可與羅斯福總統唔談、羅總統對新聞記者談俄國來函時、已着手從事凖備來函中所稱兩國間之反常現狀今已臻終止之期一語、已引起此間人士之樂觀、官場表示其私人意見者、謂若雙方談話可解决承認問題上之困難、商業當有一萬萬元以上之發動、農村信用放欵社主任摩根曹現有使俄之望、將來國會開會或有反對羅總統承認美俄之舉者、美國總工會現已表示反對、但若總統果將使俄人選提交國會議准、參議院未必有充分力量以打銷之也、（二十一日路透社電）</p>
<h3>運用外交美俄鈎心鬥角　函電之交换實係十月十九日　故意倒塡日期免起不良印象</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）　今日探悉美總統羅斯福致蘇俄中央執行委員會主席加列寗函、係用電報拍出、而其實在拍發日期、亦比公布之發函期遲九日、此種發覺、大可使華盛頓未來之復交談話、又加一重新色彩、按昨日莫斯科與華盛頓同時公布之美總統函俱稱十月十日在華盛頓發出、但頃得非正式而極可靠消息、實係十月十九日用電報直接拍與加列寗、至美總統所以倒塡日期原因、據此間所聞、蓋欲避免外間發生此事因日俄關係緊張而起之印象故也、（按十九日適在日本五相會議將次結束、速戰派勝利形勢已定之後）參證各國對此評論、亦可見國際間鈎心鬥角運用外交手腕之神妙入化也（二十國民電）</p>
<h3>垣街頓呈活氣　資本家願助貿易發展</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　目下美國全國似大都贊成美總統與蘇俄代表研究全部復交問題、垣街方面與政府意見相同、多數銀行家以爲倘總統認蘇俄之保證可以接受時、即可予以承認、若干著名銀行家並謂目下證券市塲、雖不能吸收鉅額俄債或根據蘇俄貿易所發債券、但多數資本家頗可供給私人借欵、以换取貿易或工業方面之讓與權、諒一旦承認後、蘇俄將不繼在美籌欵購買任何貨物也、若干曾與蘇俄貿易代表接洽之官員聲稱、苟有適宜信用條件、則蘇俄將凖備在美購貨五萬萬元、莫斯科消息、亦龍徵實此說、逆料將來李維諾夫與美總統討論商約大綱時、亦將提及此事、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>首任駐美俄使　梅慈勞有望</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　此時最歡迎復交問題之進展者、大約當爲前參議員白洛克哈特、白氏現任農業整理行政處顧問、專司向國外推銷農産品尤其棉花之特别運動、其次則爲參議員寇遜士、寇氏即爲在倫敦出席會議時、與蘇俄代表梅慈勞首先私人接洽者、本日聲稱、倘總統與俄代表商得圓滿恊定、則渠贊成承認俄政府、按梅慈勞現任國家設計副委員長、據本日莫斯科消息、俄當軸已内定一旦復交後、即以梅慈勞充第一任駐美大使、倘梅氏不克赴美、則或將以現任外交副委員蘇科尼廓夫充任、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福主張平均全國財富</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　羅斯福總統今日於取得華盛頓學院之名譽學位後、致詞請國人表示其從前殖民時代之合作精神、並謂現有數國、其狄克推多已製定其所謂五年或十年計畫者、但美國未有狄克推多、余以爲吾人更可推進以赴吾人目的、無須限定若干時期也、又謂以少數人之財富、普遍分配於人民、殆可致國家於安全云、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>美俄進行復交各國輿論一斑</p>
<h3>美報稱係對内作用</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　各國輿論指羅斯福總統對俄之提議、乃一勝利、惟紐約報紙若干之華盛頓訪電、則指此爲移轉國人注意由目前農村鼓噪而至蘇俄爲之一種把戲、巴黎迴聲報載裴狄那一文、謂蘇俄現漸放棄世界革命之計劃、而欲在中等階級的國家中和平工作、美國於應付目前危局時、巳稍損其驕矜日本勢力日增乃美俄接近之一原因云、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<h3>日本野心有以促成</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　報界以爲美國與蘇俄接近、係因遠東時局不安所致、咸謂一九三五年係日本緊要關頭、因日本退出國聯會之舉、將於是年生效、（會員國退出者必自通知之日起、兩年後始乃解除一切義務）一至是時、則太平洋中委任日本統治各島一問題、即當明白提出討論也、星期泰晤士報載稱、「一九三五年或將再度舉行海軍會議、日本已决定提出擴充海軍之要求、」又稱一至一九三五年、則蘇俄第二次五年計劃即將完成、而國内時局必見緩和、抑「滿洲傳來之警報、吾人不當忽視、吾人雖不能因此對於目前時局變化、即起憂慮、但意外事變之來、終不可稍存忽視之心、彼美國與蘇俄對於恢復國交、彼此均有利益一層、所以愈益了解之理由、自上述種種事實觀之、可以瞭然矣云云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>多少含有排日意味</h3>
<p>（柏林）　德國伏錫志報今日聲稱、倘美國承認蘇國、則此舉定含若干排日意味、毫無可疑、惟此國聯外之兩大國恢復邦交、將有保障維持世界和平之趨勢、德國旣亦退出國聯、對於美國尤當表示特殊同情云、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯地位不復孤立</h3>
<p>（柏林）　半官式之「外交政治通訊報」視美總統羅斯福與蘇聯中央執行委員會主席加里寗函電往返、爲目前國際上最重大之事件、該報首述承認蘇俄之事、係由美國發起、繼云、「美國承認蘇俄、可見美政府係承認現行之蘇維埃政治足以代表俄國」、該報又稱、蘇聯孤立之時代現已完全終結、一德國對此變遷、只能欣幸、蓋德國自始即相信一國之大如俄國者、决不致立於西方各國團體之外、並以爲俄國在國際關係上完全恢復其原有地位、則以後國際上種種政治經濟問題、自易恢復常態矣」、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>不啻對日一種警告</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　法國報界對於美國與蘇俄之日趨接近、頗爲注意、「時報」以專文評論此事、謂蘇俄外交委員長不日赴美、其與羅斯福之談話將甚感興趣、該報謂「羅斯福與蘇俄復交之計畫、不啻對日本之一種警告、又德國對蘇俄之意向如何、羅斯福已深知之、故此種舉動、又爲對德國之一種警告、」惟時報與「清議報」仍表示若干保留態度、「時報」深恐蘇俄在美國宣傳革命及共産主義「清議報」則謂美總統之計畫、不啻鞏固蘇維埃政治、急進黨各報謂蘇俄志在實行恊調及和平政策、前與其鄰近各國及法國訂立互不侵犯條約、即爲實行此種政策之開端、蘇俄此種志願、現日趨堅固、深爲可幸云、（廿一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>函電往還無異承認</h3>

<h3>退出軍縮與國聯德國持之成理　軍備監察徒有其名　列國歧視萬難忍受　英公法家代德抱不平</h3>
<p>（柏林）　國民新聞社駐歐特約記者兹自可靠方面、探得德國退出軍縮會議以及國際聯盟本身之眞實理由、據云、英外相西門於十月十四日所提出議案之目的、在使各武裝完備之國家之減縮再行遲延四年、此議案旋即爲重要國家之代表團通過、再則此議案詞句至爲含混、故即屆四年期滿之後、各國軍備之是否眞的減縮、猶在不可知之數、蓋此尚須視監視之得法與否、而所謂監視亦係僅指德國之軍備而言者、故在四年之後、各國仍得藉口監視之不滿意、或德國之如何違犯條約上之義務等等、而拒絕减縮其軍備、即以單方之監視一項而言、亦屬至不名譽之事、而爲德國所萬難忍受者、蓋此項監視辦法之根據、即爲日内瓦所公開宣傳之讕言、如德國之新政府實爲歐洲和平之障碍云云等是、再復有一重要之點、即爲四年之後、列强之軍備減縮究竟將至何種程度、則在議案中並未有明文之解釋、而德國則竭力欲將此點加以明訂、但終不能如願、故德國深覺各强之目的、實爲各國軍備之無限的保留、而對於德國則爲無限的箝制、再如德國國防軍之改組爲短期民團、亦屬爭論之一點、并可據以爲反德宣傳之工具、且德國國防軍無論如何改組、均不能認爲各國對德之讓步、或德國軍力之增加、蓋德國現有常備國防軍十萬人、將來改爲短期之民團二十萬、實力祗有減縮、實際上係德國對於列强之讓步也、如以二十萬枝槍與法國之八百萬枝槍相較、已屬勢力懸殊、更無須計及德國四週之其他各國矣、故此種計劃、不啻欲使德國受第二次之解除武裝是以德國之斷然拒絕、各國聞之亦不能視爲異舉、若謂德國已得重幣武裝之機會、而掩飾各國自身之不願减縮軍備之私心、則德國實萬難承認者也、（二十一日國民電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>美蘇關係之新動向</h3>
<p>— 偉</p>
<p>最近由於美總統羅斯福氏與蘇聯中央執行委員會主席加里寗氏函電之交换。美蘇兩國間之關係。乃顯然呈現一種光明之氣象。而在此急轉直下之情勢中。蘇聯且將應美總統之邀請。派李維諾夫氏訪問白宫。則「在今日國際關係之黑暗背景中。實爲一可喜之事件。」質言之。美國將放棄其不承認蘇聯之傳統政策。而與蘇聯恢復正常之國交。今日殆已達到即將實現之時機。</p>
<p>歷來横梗於美蘇復交一問題前之礁石有三。爲克倫斯基政府時代之債務及歐洲大戰之戰債問題。爲美僑在蘇聯境内財産被没收問題。爲共産宣傳問題。以此三因。乃自威爾遜總統以至目前。中間經歷哈定柯立治胡佛諸氏。歷時亘十六年之久。而美國對蘇聯之遠避固拒。乃儼若已成爲不可變易之國策。雖今日世界列强。已無一不與蘇聯復交。而美仍我行我素。一九二八年四月間美國務卿開洛。發表「重申美政府向來之對蘇政策」宣言。且認爲美政府之對蘇政策爲先知先覺。此種固執而堅决之態度。誠爲一頗堪驚異之事。</p>
<p>今羅斯福總統。洞觀世界大勢之趨向。一反往昔一貫的對蘇政策。毅然提出對一九一七年十一月七日使美俄絕交之懸案。覓取共同解决之新途徑。乃愈徵其見識之遠大。及其打破障壁之勇毅。而博得國際輿論之盛譽。蓋今日世界巳臨到十分嚴重之境地。尤其遠東之局勢。以日本一種窮兵黷武之行爲。與其侵略野心爲之策動。更隂霾四塞。危殆不可終朝。爲維持世界和平計。爲戢止遠東方面如火如荼之戰機計。爲阻遏野心國家之侵略行爲。及其危害全人類之厄運計。此太平洋上之兩大國家。丨美國與蘇聯。實有捐棄其夙嫌。改善其關係。誠意携手之必要。美國不少賢明之人士。於九一八學變發生之後曾大聲疾呼。倡言與蘇聯恢復過去關係。以遏止遠東之災禍。同時蘇聯政府亦曾痛快表示。美蘇諒解。實爲阻止戰爭火燄之關鍵。此種觀察實至正確。故此次美蘇外交關係之接近。一方面固由於羅斯福總統之遠識與勇毅。另一方面則亦由於遠東嚴重局勢之推移。設時至今日。而美蘇兩國之政治家。猶不能基於維護世界和平之立塲上。誠意携手。則全人類無形中所蒙受之損失。殆眞無可數計矣。</p>
<p>再就美蘇兩國之本身言之。姑無論由於「美日」「蘇日」在遠東之衝突。有促成兩大改善關係之必要。即基於經濟之利益上而言。則美國復興計劃程序。與蘇聯第二五年計劃。彼此進行。均有便利。如美蘇復交。果以此次李維諾夫氏之訪問白宫而克實現。則一方面固可謂爲蘇聯一貫的和平外交政策所收獲之另一碩果。而他一方面。亦不能不謂爲由於美國今日已切實認清蘇聯立國基礎之鞏固。及其國際間所佔之重要地位。</p>
<p>總之在今日隂霾蔽空。全人類方憂慮一種災禍即將到臨之際。而美蘇兩大國間之外交關係。乃突呈現一清新之氣象。不能不認爲有益世界之舉。故吾人對於此次李維諾夫氏之渡美。無不嚴重注意。而於其未來之結果。更不能不以十二分之熱望。表示其期待之殷。</p>

<p>主席顧孟餘致開會辭云、長江爲我國最大河流、古稱天塹、飛渡爲難、致大江南北、自爲風氣、缺憾殊多、自民國成立後、雖屢有建橋之議、但以經費浩大、非財政困難情况之下所可明辯、前任部長孫哲生氏、有鑒及此、乃盡起輪渡建築、以爲發展近幾交通之政策、經召集專家縝密研究、始决定建造輪渡、此舉在我國猶屬創舉、而關於技術上之種種、亦爲我國第一次之試騐、輪渡功用、雖不能與鐵橋相提並論、然物運旣可藉以暢通、而經費又較橋樑爲省、誠屬創舉、在建築期中一承中外人士之贊助、未及三年卽告完成、今日舉行通車典禮其意義不僅在紀念通車、蓋中國建設事業、千端萬緒、待辦者甚多、渡輪建築、乃其中最小之一部、今日之典禮、一方面紀念通車、一方面對將來之建設事業、亦抱有無　之希望云云、</p>

<h3>汪致訓詞</h3>
<p>汪院長代表國府訓詞云、此次輪渡用　極儉、據　部長鄭處長之報告、全部工程僅用二百八十萬、若與建橋之三千萬相較、已省二千六百萬、而輪渡之功用、又與橋樑相埒、誠屬費廉效宏之舉、甚望今後各種建設事業、均以此輪渡爲模範、則政府必可省出一部經費、爲其他建設事業之舉、至此次輪渡得以迅速成功、其重要原因、乃幾年中政治未有變遷、而技術上各工作人員、亦不因政務官之　迭、而有所變换中國建設事業、如交通鐵道等待辦甚多、希望均如輪渡之成功、同時並須不因政治影響而發生阻滯、使其得以迅速完成、則建設前途、必有莫大安慰、</p>

<h3>三項條件</h3>
<p>怡和各輪理貨工友、所受待遇、較之任何公司爲劣、不能維持生活經工友自行召集各輪代表、决定改善條件三項、（一）每一理貨員工、自本年十月份起、每月增加大洋六元正、（二）輪船遇險、除依照海商法辦理外、其一年薪率、不滿六百五十元、其撫卹不得少過六百五十元、生還者賠償損失費一百六十元、其職業須優先安插、（三）每年年終雙薪取消、改爲每月升工三天、</p>
<h3>工會交涉</h3>
<p>工友以公司久無表示、顯屬毫無誠意、故於前日毅然採取罷工行動同時由理貨俱樂部常委王正馥·率領全體工友、向中華海員工會籌備委員會及海員特别黨部請願、海員工會當由秘書后大椿接見、除力囑各工友嚴守秩序、不得有軌外行動外、一面並飭上海分會調查及派秘書孫履平、前往公司交涉、當於下午晤該公司大班土德（Ｔod）總買辦潘志銓、對三項條件、完全接受、大班土德、並表示一切願與工會接洽、其他任何人、皆不能參與談判、並訂今日簽訂恊約工會仍將派孫秘書辦理、久懸不决之加薪問題、至是始告圓滿解决、</p>

<h3>歐戰浩刧</h3>
<p>之後、列强痛定思痛、故於國聯約章八條規定、會員國應承認裁减軍備、至足供保障國際及履行國際義務、曾以常設軍備委員會、研究解决軍縮之技術問題、以混合委員會解决軍縮之政治問題、因一九二三年之保障恊約草案、與一九二四年之日内瓦議定書、均因英國反對而未得採用、其後因英·德·法·等、因局部恊商、締結羅加諾公約、安全保障仲裁各問題、有相當解决、始有軍縮預備會議之召集、在國聯之外、又有美總統召集之日内瓦海軍會議、繼續華府會議未完事業、結果失敗、英美</p>
<h3>海軍競爭</h3>
<p>愈益尖銳化、一九二九年、英國上院於批准非戰公約、同星期内、國會通過建造十五萬噸巡艦法案、胡佛就任後、努力中止英·美·間之海軍競爭、英國工黨内閣總理、後親赴美國、成立英美海軍平等諒解後、開倫敦五强海軍會議、簽定五强海軍恊約、是約於一九三五年滿期、卽於是年召集第二次海軍軍縮會議、而德·日·兩國、</p>
<h3>退出國聯</h3>

<p>（六比三）</p>
<p>邱王戰况</p>
<h3>▲擊法相同</h3>
<p>邱王兩人、同爲底線長袖之健將、百穩不失其一、故兩人對陣、因戰法之相同、興趣上勢必减少、然王文正之功夫、究差不少、因之王欲勝邱、必另尋出路、於是果見王時時上網、然因厭殺之不穩、球之觸網、爲數累累、而邱則不减其態、勝負亦卽分於此、以言精彩、殊不多見、在王文正言、則巳進步多矣、</p>
<h3>▲直落三勝</h3>
<p>王文正開球、發球者皆勝、直至成四比四後、邱飛海破王之發球局、成五比四、局面於是展開、然而王亦照樣報復、再成五比五、邱卒再勝二局而得勝第一盤、此盤苦戰後、王之堅持力、已大减、形勢急轉而直下、王發球得勝後、邱一連得四局、第六局王得、邱以六比二再勝第二盤、末了一盤、又成各勝一局又一局之局面、三比三後、邱連得三局、六比三成直落三得勝、</p>

<h3>萬五千人齊聲贊賞</h3>
<p>出席全國運動之滬港兩足球隊、昨日會師於中華棒球塲、此爲上海足球季開始以來、最精彩之一幕、球塲四週人山人海、約有一萬五千人、熱鬧非凡、香港爲報全運會失敗之恨起見、昨特借廣東隊中之四騎士之一李天生葉北華等加入助戰、是以陣容益爲鞏固、表演愈覺出色、奔跑迅速、傳遞美妙、脚頭爽辣無疵、動作巧妙清脆、觀者讚美備至、嘆觀止焉、至於滬隊雖頑强抵抗、處處暴露軟弱之態、優勝劣敗、不可强求、港隊之以二比一得勝、誰曰不宜、惟滬隊周鐵門未出塲、梁樹棠於下半時方調入、此爲滬隊减色之由來也、</p>
<h3>吳市長舉行開球禮</h3>
<p>此場比賽、雖屬友誼性質、實無異爲滬港埠際比賽、故禮式頗爲隆重、運動界名宿元老、均曾到吳市長開球（啓昌攝）</p>
<p>塲參觀、市長吳鐵城、特捐贈銀杯一只、未開賽前、先將銀杯陳列塲之中心點、光輝奪目、博得掌聲不少、並由吳市長行開球禮、比賽結果、由吳市長親自頒奬、並致詞以歡迎之三呼而散、</p>
<h3>初開賽形勢就緊張</h3>

<h3>葉北華結束上半時</h3>
<p>滬隊失球後、羣雄聚會、努力反攻、徐亞輝更見奮發希圖將功折罪、香港門前幾見敵騎縱横、幸包鋼門眼快手溜、處之泰然、救出險球不少、冷不防一球漏出、鄭季良得到接濟、快馬加鞭、乘虚直入、傳於葉北華、北華頓時活躍、莽張飛阻之不得、直搗龍門、輕輕踢入、香港隊又勝一球、時已開審後四十分鐘矣、滬隊正謀收復失地無奈時不我許、上半時遂以二對零結束、</p>
<h3>李義臣巧踢十二碼</h3>
<p>檸檬時間一過、戰士重上疆塲、滬隊專取攻勢、立志收復失地、陳家球大賣氣力、孫鐵腿一球就地滾去、包鋼門資格老到、伏地撲之、球離門左三寸許偏出、造成角球、陳家球不高不低、踢在門前、義臣用頭一頂、恰落鋼門手中、又被救出、滬隊二次進攻、李石友沿邊挺進、球入内衛線、梁榮照阻之過急、一不小心、被罰十二碼、李義臣主罰、無話可說、滬隊撥回一球、</p>
<h3>香港隊榮奪市長杯</h3>
<p>是從港險採取守勢、滬隊反攻更烈、愈後愈見精采、李義臣、孫錦順、屢失良機、兼以港隊後衛森嚴、鋼門難破、經三十分之鏖戰、　見成效、黄美順曾乘亞攻進一球、以越位未算、結果香港隊卒以二比一勝上海隊、奪得市長杯而歸、裁判員沈回春、雙方陴線如下、</p>

<h3>章輯五赴歐美研究體育</h3>
<p>▲下月十四日放洋</p>
<h3>▲章氏小史</h3>
<p>章輯五字濟武、現年四十二歳、天津市人、在前清宣統二年、畢業於直隸省高等工業學校機械工程科、在學部覆試、列最優等第一名、給予舉人學位、卒業後、留校敎授物理英文諸科、兼課外運動管理、民國二年、改就天津上海大連等處美孚油行工程師、民國四年受南開學校之聘、任物理英文等科敎員、兼課外運動管理及童子軍敎練、歷充天津學校體育聯合會會長、天津中華童子軍聯合會名譽總幹事、民國十二年、因感於中華民族體育敎育之急需、遂赴國立東南大學體育系、隨美國體育名家麥克樂先生、研究中國體育問題、民國十三年仍返天津南開學校服務、充南開大學中學女子中學小學四部體育主任、歷充華北體育聯合會名譽書記、天津體育協進會會長、天津市公共體育塲董事、及青年會體育委辦、</p>
<h3>▲出國緣起</h3>
<p>予在天津南開學校及體育界服務、將近二十年、在此二十年中、對於實施中國體育敎育、經歷困難問題頗多、久欲出國考察以資借鏡、前年南開張伯苓校長、自美歸後、卽擬命余出洋、嗣以華北時局不靖、國難方殷、學校經濟困難、無法實行、最近辦得河北省留學貸費五千元、及各方親友之援助、凑足旅費、足供二年之用、遂决定出洋計劃、</p>
<h3>▲對於體育之信仰</h3>
<p>中國在今日救國困難問題、國人皆謂不外貧弱二字、但仔細研究中國的根本問題、予嘗謂不在貧而在弱、何以言之、試看一看中國最近調查的統計、就知道了、中國國民平均年齡之短促、各項疾病死亡之驚人鉅數、他如生産能力之薄弱、道德嗜好之墮落、生活習慣之不正軌等等、無一不與體育健康問題、有直接關係、所以予嘗以爲中國各種事業之落後、完全因爲現在没有幾個健康偉大的人物出來、民族的危險是怎樣大呀、所以中華民族之根本問題、實在弱是原因、貧不過是結果罷了</p>
<h3>▲出國計劃</h3>
<p>現代體育的發源、始　　自希臘羅馬、次自瑞典德國、最近發達於美國、所以余此次出國、擬先赴歐洲約留一年、次赴美國再留一年、爲期以二年爲限、在歐以德京柏林爲中心、常駐柏林體章輯五君近影</p>
<p>育大學、分赴其他各國、考察應注意之點、如意大利自法西斯黨墨索里尼當政、對於國民體育異常重視、擬有具體的計劃、切實推行、中國不無可效法者、蘇俄五年計劃完畢後、不少成功、對於訓練青年的方法、并如何使體育普羅化民衆化、中國亦有可效法的地方、瑞士國的軍事敎育、丹麥的新體操、瑞典之矯正體操、英吉利業餘運動、及仁俠精神之養成、皆爲研究體育者不可忽略之學問、至於德意志自大戰之後、割地賠欵、限制軍備、處處受條約之拘束、與中國所處環境不無相似、然德意志民族奮鬥的精神、如何寓軍事於體育的種種方法、爲余個人所欽佩者、亦爲我國現在最應取法者、所以余决計在歐常駐德國少與國人接觸、藉以吸收其民族奮鬥的精神、第二年再赴美國、研究其如何使體育科學化及敎育化的各種方法、</p>
<h3>▲個人國内責任之脱卸</h3>
<p>予在國内所負的責任、最大者爲南開學校體育主任、及天津體育協進會會長之職、關於南開學校予此次出國、已得張伯苓校長之贊同、給假二年、體育課不設主任、改爲委員制、以敎務主任充當體育委員會的主席、其他職務均由各位體育敎員、分别擔任、南開的體育、已近軌道、有了相當的基礎、予離校之後、不致發生問題、至於天津體育協進會會長的職務、予離津之後、暫由副會長代行職權也不會發生問題的、</p>
<h3>▲行踪</h3>
<p>予訂於本年十一月十四日搭意大利郵船由滬登程、十二月七日在意大利Ｂrindisi登岸、九日到Ｎaples留三日、再赴意京羅馬、約留兩星期、約二十日至Ｆlorence參觀新築之體育塲、二十二日至瑞士日内瓦、月底至德國Ｅssen友人宅度歳、一九三四年新年後、入德京、通信處由中國駐德公使館轉、</p>

<h3>上海市近十年來醫藥鳥瞰（續）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第七章　結論</p>
<p>本文陸續寫來。不覺巳盡二萬餘言。雖然隨記事實。隨加些評語。而按照普通體例。似乎還應有一總交代。因把以上種種。仍舊分類歸納。一面就事論斷。一面聲述原委。附帶再添上我個人的意見。就作爲本文的結論罷。</p>
<p>（一）學說一言以蔽之曰「是非未判的。」這原因實在還受千百年文化的影響。而新敎育又不普及之故。國人到今日之下。還犯着故步自封。夜郎自大的毛病。對於人家的長處。還抱着趦趄的態度。妒忌的思想。硬要說中華文明古國。一切一切。早就發達在西人之前。好比看了鏡花緣小說。就稱飛機自我發明。看了三國演義。偏道機械是我固有。於是一味抱着舊書。與新說對壘。記得以前開鐵道。辦電報。也曾經許多大臣的阻撓。然而終於結果是如何。諸位今日想想。怕也要失笑。在醫藥方面。雖因爲許多病可以自愈。許多藥幸中偶合。而一時分不出什麽是非來。實際上莫說於思想的人。知道舊醫早晚淘汰。就是舊醫自己。也知道日就衰微。所以急謀補救。只可惜學說不能整理。祇有提倡業務。但是天下只有那學說可以扶助業務。萬無以業務牽制學說之理。要拿石匠造的橋。推翻學校裏的土木工程科。到底做不到吧！。至於舊醫材料方面可貴的中藥。固然其多。但照他們現在業務中日使用的。顚來倒去不過二三百種。倘新醫爲社會所提倡。則整理的初步。並非難事。「不過小兒的胎盤。女人的褲子。（燒褌散）那些古怪野蠻東西。似乎可以放棄了。」所以短時間的而逐步减少的漏巵。也不成什麽問題。至於胃口上愛吃國藥的人們。包管仍有上</p>
<p>之農。販藥之商的一切生計問題。來箝制維新者的口。實在更無道理。試問全國禁烟。要剗除鶯粟花時。可以有人起來說。「顧全農民生計土販營業烟商膏血攸關。」而永遠不許改種稻麥麽？而况藥物。並不在剗除之列呢。凡事興革。自有興革的代價。須要先决興革是否合理。自然其餘迎刃而解。則足適履。圖一時的苟安。終久爲事實所不容。徒然多受磨折而已。這個醫藥學說問題。雖然上繫乎敎育行政兩大機關。而社會人士。也務必認清潮流趨勢。用有力的輿論。扶助新說的早興。以便舊藥精華。早受合法整理。一方面還望舊醫子弟。幡然改圖。勿爲傳統的神秘信徒。大好青年。天下何事不可爲。而定要迷戀於這些不合宜的業術呢。？要知今日社會上。大讚某中醫的人。將來其子。必不請某中醫的學生兒子治病。舊醫若以此時算傳統發揚的機會。未免眼光短淺。上了社會的當了。</p>
<p>近年頗有人拿新舊醫的學理。借少數人的業務來較短長。如當日褚君民誼。也曾欲偕此辦法。顧全雙方爭論。焦君易堂。簡直將一二人的成績。三四個的治例。當作鐵案。來替舊醫張目。實在不是個辦法。上海中西療養院。一面掛着法國人郎培安的牌子。一面設着陸仲安國醫的診室。結果各行各事。中西醫藥雜投。還不是莫明其妙。丨若要澈底的試騐。祗有開一個大醫院。請幾個飽學知名新醫在内。凡病人入院。由新醫診斷定了病名。然後完全讓舊醫去治。隨他針炙。按摩。湯頭。丸散。或者竟是徧訪名山。弄些仙草丹方。也無不可。如此聚數千百例。做個統計。譬如說。胃癌治愈幾個。腦膜炎治愈多少。傷寒死亡率若干。白喉腥紅熱治愈若干。丨就狠可以研究學說誰是誰非。效用在醫在藥了。但是這種事。須要社會上起來督促了做。放公平了說話。不要徒逢一己的好惡。而空說才好。</p>
<h3>爲有志革新中國醫藥者進一忠告（二）</h3>
<p>— 周莎</p>
<p>（二）醫藥的分界</p>
<p>我們如果要改進舊醫學，第一就要把「醫」和「藥」的界限分别清楚，切莫把醫藥併爲一譚，因爲舊醫完全是理論。（不合科學的理論）舊藥是從幾千萬無辜病人身上冒險考騐出來的東西。舊藥雖然有這樣的功效，但是使用舊醫不能下確切的診斷，而單靠了那「寒熱温凉」「升降浮沉」以五行配五臟」的荒唐藥理，去糟塌這些良好的天産。所以所得的效果，實在是事倍而功未能半。因此我們必須把舊「醫」「藥」的界限分别清楚了，再去譚改進，否則不知要跟着二噠子繞多少灣兒呢？</p>
<p>我們來講舊醫吧！舊醫學的理論，荒唐怪誕，滿紙隂陽五行，凡是涉獵過一些舊醫警的人，大概多知道罷。即使稍爲樸質一點的如張長沙著的傷寒卒病論，究竟不能算現代適用的東西。或許給我們當參考的資料則可。倘一定要挾之以横行天下，恐怕一定要被自然的淘汰的。關於舊醫界中批評舊醫的理論，眞是疊床架屋，不知有幾十斤了，但是要揀　篇釐然有當於吾心的，却是不容易找，作者所最佩服的只有靈素商兌和六氣論。（余雲岫著見余氏醫述）因爲這兩篇文字已把舊醫學的大本營攻破了，其它枝枝節節的辯論豈能勝此，讀者不妨試一檢讀，以證作者，非騙人。余雲岫先生曾說：「舊醫之理論荒唐怪誕，</p>
<p>無可掩諱，惟有聽其淪喪而已丨欲保存國粹，於方藥尚有一綫希望。嘗讀神農本草經，其文質樸，其言藥主味，不雜荒誕之理論。…………後世治藥物者：如吳普，李當之，陶宏景，許愼激之流：謹守師法，不過於藥物之作用，指其當然而己！不敢稍涉玄言。」（見余譯藥理學序，因手邊無原書可考，謹記其大略。）明慧的讀者試一味斯言。</p>
<p>（三）方法</p>
<p>舊醫們的所謂那一張方子好和那一味藥靈者，不過是醫好了一二個人而已，並没有一定的標凖，我們要知道某種藥物的確切功效，一定先要有明確的診斷，診斷了是某病，然後再　藥，並且記錄他的經過，這樣算一例，例子愈多愈好，漸漸的積多了。再去觀察它在那幾種病的症狀上最有效騐，和它所以奏效的理由。如果認承這一味藥物在臨床上是有效的，那末再去分析它的成分再去做科學上的種種試騐。國醫評論曾有沈警凡先生著的應用統計學整理國藥舉例一文，余氏醫述内有國産藥件研究之第一步一文，讀者都可參看，大致都是改進舊藥的方法。所以我們應該用統計方法去研究舊藥，還可收些效果，否則盲人瞎馬，夜半深池眞危險萬分了，舊藥的改進方法如此，至於舊藥的　論呢？現在似乎有許多人在大呼整理，整理出來的成績，不過是說「新醫的怎麽就是舊醫的怎麽」，總之一定要使天下無數的青年，知道新醫學界所發明的種種學理，我們的神農黄帝張仲聖孫眞人在幾千年前早已知道了。新醫不得不讓我高出一頭」等觀念而已！試問舍新的學理而不用，而一定要服從幾千年前的舊理論，假使想中國在世界地圖上多存在幾日的人，不會出此吧？（參看本文第六節）</p>
<p>（四）　工具</p>
<p>研究舊藥，旣用了統計方法來確定某種藥物是有價值的是應該再加於研究，的那末用怎麽做工具來動手呢？年來舊醫們所用爲鐵甲車的新中藥，是把巳有報告的幾種藥物作用標出來，就算改進舊藥的能事了，不管人家的報告，錯也好，不錯也好，一古腦兒拿了過來。他不知這種工作是暫時的，不是永久的，永久的工作。那是把藥物拿到實騐室裏，仔些地分析，用種種科學上的試騐，臨床上的試用，然後再用到普遍的臨床上。試看余雲岫先生用舊藥創製的「止痛消炎膏」他的經過，多少曲折，多少令人有興味，多少值得我們欽佩。（見新藥時報劉步青　）朋友！我告訴你：不用科學做工具去研究舊藥，是不會收作好的結果，所得者不過是一些糢糊的印象而已，</p>
<p>（五）　材料</p>
<p>研究舊藥，所用的材料，當然是舊藥無疑了。但是藥店中泡製的已不適用，適用的那是種植的生藥：而且生藥又有　　關係而其成分亦有不同，如日光，空氣，雨量，地質，採取的時間，等等。要明明白白的去措置裕如，非精於「生藥學」不可。中國關係這種研究很少，據作者所　有袁涉範，徐伯鋆等。</p>
<p>（六）　闢舊</p>
<p>舊醫理論的荒唐怪誕，旣到了大家知道不能掩諱的地步，我們當然把它廢棄好了，何必拿來怎麽整理，引經據典的把暗合科學的地方記出來。（其實還是牽强附會的）然而舊醫界中大有人在做這門工作，以作者的意見，實在大可不必，因爲我們生活科學刻刻在進化中的現代，爲甚要一定回到幾千年的古國裏去，即使它是暗合科學的，那末只要服從科學好了，更不必多此一舉了。作者於此不得不引余雲岫先生之言以證之。曰，「蓋此種工作，祇能最科學醫所己知之事，巳　之理，以證前古之說：而所證前古之說，皆爲今日所已有之事，於現代醫學，絕無裨益，絕無影響，成以舊醫之立塲言之。此種工作，似屬重要之舉：而以現代醫學全體言之；此種工作，不過發古人之潛德幽光，在上古中古近古醫學史上，爭一席地位而巳丨至其學說，爲現代醫學所已知，無之不爲預：有之不爲益也。」讀者大概對於舊醫們　謂的「整理國醫學說」的價值，充分明白了吧？作者更引新會梁啓超氏的話，以作本文之結束。</p>

<p>梁氏清代學術概論頁一四五：「摭古書片詞單語以傳會今義，以易發生兩種流弊：一，倘可印證之義，某表裏相脗合，善巳；若稍有牽合附會。則最易導國民以不正確之觀念，而緣郢　燕說以滋弊。例如讀昔談立憲談共和者，偶見經典中某句某字與立憲共和等字義略相近，　摭拾　沾沾自喜，謂此種爲　所固有；其實今世立憲制度之爲物，即秦泰西亦不過起於近百年，求諸彼古代之希臘羅馬且不可得，遑論我國。而比附之言，傳播旣廣，則能使多數之眼光之思想，見局見縛於此所比附之文句；以爲所謂立憲共和者不過如是，而不復追求其眞義之所好。…此等結習，最易爲國民研究實學之魔障。二，勸人行此制，告之曰，吾先哲　嘗行也，勸人治此學，告之曰　吾先哲所嘗治也：其勢較易人，固也。然頻以此相治，則人於先哲未嘗行之制，輒疑其不可行；於先哲未嘗治之學，輒疑其不當治。無行之中，恒足以增其故見自滿之習。而障其擇善服從之明。………吾雅不願采　隔牆桃李之繁葩，綴結於家吾於杉松之老幹，而沾沾自鳴得意；吾誠愛桃李也，惟當思所以移植之，而何必使與杉松淆其名實哉」。乙卯年國風報）又曰；「此諸論者，雖專爲一問題而　：然啓超對於我們舊思想之總批判，及其所認爲今後新思想發展應遵之途徑，皆略見焉。中國思想之痌疾，確在「好依傍」與「名實混淆」。</p>
<p>總之一句話；作者對於中國整個的醫藥事業，希望他往新的路上跑；不希望他迷戀已死去舊理論。更希望有爲青年，再不要中了舊醫的毒。作者的意思，「君子觀之亦足見其志之所在」！（完）</p>
<h3>潛伏結核之一般狀態及其對於人身之利益（二）</h3>
<p>— 謝筠夀</p>
<p>著者思之　因結核知識之不普及。致現世發生如此之可怖現象。雖日夕呈於眼前。而毫不注意。著者對於世上之此等爲父兄者。實不堪遺恨。判於本人。又不勝惋惜。實則如斯之潛伏結核患者。多爲小兒及少年。倘施以適當之治療法。與養生。實有可驚之偉大效力。著者以爲僅在數年以内。可由此而將小兒及少年之薄弱體質。根本的改良。由此點論之。則兹所述之預防養生法之重要。更可知之矣。</p>
<p>（其三）除上述兩種外。又有重大之意味而不能不歸入潛伏結核症者。即下述各種類之疾患者。世上實頗多存在。</p>
<p>此在診察上雖有極正式之肺結核或肋膜結核。但在自己或他人。從來不覺其有何等之障碍。發現於身體。且其有疾病之部分。不知於何時。在不知不覺間。達某程度之治愈。在肺尖或肋膜。結成所謂瘢痕。而徒留無害之形。此等人偶然因罹其他疾病。受醫師之診察。醫師偶然發見。以爲結核正在活動進行。而大驚小怪。謀種種　治療法。患者聞之。常大爲悲觀。此乃診察法之惡劣。其結核今日决不活動。乃旣治療者也。此時在診察上打診一側之肺尖爲短音或有抵抗。聽診上呼氣音銳變而延長。或在背部。肋膜厚而硬固。此等變化。决無用驚恐。如請熟練之醫師診察時。則果爲正在進行之肺病或肋膜炎。抑旣多年存在。大半治愈。而無治療之必要者。均能判别之。丨丨此等鑑别。實屬必要。丨丨總之旣已大半治愈。現在已成功潛在結核症。對於健康上。雖無危險之意義。但達後年以此部多容易再發。所以有此等潛在結核症之人。目下之治療。雖無必要。而後來之預防。實爲緊要也。</p>
<p>試將以上之三種總論之。</p>
<p>（一）肺結核症幸有治療之傾向。而入於恢復期。更進而消退。外觀上雖似乎全　治療。但實際上未十分完全治療者。往往有之。故雖一次入於恢復期或進而達於治療之患者。亦不可不顧及後來長久存在之潛伏肺結核而加以養生。</p>
<p>（二）生來身體薄弱。顔貌蒼白者。殆多爲潛伏結核。一見雖似乎健康之人。而其潛在之肺結核或肋膜及其他之結核。長久存在。而不注意者往往有之。</p>
<p>以上述眼光觀察世人。則潛伏結核患者。其數之多。殊足驚人。此等人如思及後來在任何時均有發生肺結核之可能。有不令人寒心者乎。故著者在此處所述養生法之精神。不僅對於自以爲病者之恢復期患者。即對於身體薄弱之世人亦然。乃普遍的對結核之預防養生法也。决非僅爲紙上之空論。全爲吾人目前之實際問題。世間萬人之健康增進長壽法也。</p>
<p>▲潛伏結核對於人體之利益</p>
<p>凡生物界之現象。往往互成因果。其原因結果。輒循環輪迴。著者對於潛伏結核之可恐一點。固已說明。但潛伏結核對於該人身體之有利一點。亦非說明不可。夫一切細菌性疾患。有一種之免疫。曾一次罹該病者。其身體中發生一種之防禦物質。可以亨受後來再不感傳該病之天然恩惠。如曾罹腸傷寒一次者。其一生涯中無再罹腸傷寒之事。天然痘之預防法　爲人工的　痘。乃故意的預使發生輕度痘瘡之一種。後來可以避免眞正之重症天然痘者。即此理也。結核雖無完全之免疫。但某一程度之免度。則確有之。例如幼時腺病質（小兒之潛伏結核）者。迨成年時罹肺結核。其疾病多爲良性。而不進行。反之幼時甚爲健康。非結核質者。達青年期傳染結核。則其進行頗速。數年内即死者居多。此因其旣往無結核質。缺乏免疫力故也。又以前曾罹肋膜炎（肋膜炎之大多數爲結核性）者。所生之肺結核。或以前曾罹結核性骨關節炎，脊椎骨瘍，（脊椎骨瘍乃脊髓骨之結核）者所生之肺結核。或現在正患此種疾病者。所生之肺結核。常爲輕症。而重症者少。</p>
<p>從此等關係觀察之。潛伏結核。一方面固屬可恐。何則。因如前所述。有隨時爆發之危險。但從他方面觀察之。寧謂有此潛伏結核者。對於該人之身體。反非常有利。何則。有此者對於該人身體上重症結核之爆發。常得以防禦之。有保險瓣之作用者也。是以兒童有腺病質。無須過於憂慮。且從他方面言之。其腺病質反可謂爲對於肺結核正在施行安全防禦之證據也。此等狀態。倘能注意日常預防養生法而實行之。毫不足恐者也。</p>
<p>結核固普遍於人類社會。爲威脅人類健康之大敵。但非十分可恐之疾患也。其證據如下。試從屍體解剖或「士貝可林」皮膚反應兩者之確實診斷法觀察之。則人類百人中之九十人以上。其體内幾無不保有多少之潛伏結核竈者。（見上集第四節）但人類斃於結核症之數，僅不過全人類之七分之一。然其餘之七分之六（百人中之八十五人）。雖傳染結核。然其結局則一生涯間均能打勝結核。以全其天年。可以證明之矣。换言之。人類幾皆有一次傳染結核。唯以潛伏結核之狀態。終生爲一幸福之人者。較之因結核而死亡者。有數倍之多。實則在現時之世態。吾輩一生涯間。欲完全預防結核之傳染。可謂至難之事矣。例如即使在小兒。雖如何講求完全預防傳染之方法。然不知不覺的已傳染結核者甚多。此因結核菌在地上到處普遍散在。實無可如何者也。傳染之預防。雖爲必要。但各人旣皆有潛伏結核存在於體内者。注意日常之養生法。使身體内無潛伏結核發起之餘地。乃一最緊要之問題。著者特將此等注意。爲諸君一述之。（完）</p>
<h3>介紹「理學診療院」於上海民衆及醫界同仁</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>龐京周醫師曾在醫藥評論第五卷第一期裏面發表了一篇「理學治療集中的我見。」他的意思，以爲：現在最新的治療方法就是理學治療器械治療，而這種治療代價是很高的，在現在的中國享受這種治療的人並不多，而我國醫師爲適應世界潮流起見，於是你也買一架愛克司光，他也買一架太陽燈。結果弄得東西分置，七零八落，每天每具的器械，祗能供一二人使用。而病人們要尋覓一個治療所在，就非東問信西打聽不可。雜色的醫生借此於中取利，貽害社會。因爲以上種種的不便，所以龐氏的建議，主張設一種合資的理學治療院，或器械治療院，把所有的設備，集中在一處，使得病家就治順便而又經濟。</p>
<p>龐氏的大文，使得我們感覺到深切的猛省。理學治療的確是一種最新而效用最大的治療方法，聽不出和看不見的病症，用愛克司光是可以昭然若揭的，一切藥力所不能到的病症，用器械治療如透熱器，太陽燈，愛克司光，鐳錠等，都有奏效的成績了！診斷上的懷疑和錯誤，都可以用這種最新的方法來解决了！我們之需要理學治療，實在是迫於眉睫，不僅適應世界之潮流而已！但是反觀現在醫界的情形。則誠如龐氏所云，器械是簡陋而不能集中，病人是疲於奔命的。需要如此的急迫，而設備則如此的分歧，這實在是不能不令人悲觀的啊！</p>
<p>不僅此也，龐氏所見到的僅僅乎是一面，而另一面則龐氏尚未言及。誰也知道列强的經濟侵略，中一天天的加緊着。以醫藥界而論，外國醫生和外國藥品，都占着最好的地位，偌大的上海，貴族式的病人幾乎全被外籍醫生所包辦了！平心而論，固然是由於中國人的排外心理，同時，也由他們有着雄厚的資本，和器械設備的完全，所以上海這地方，并不是没有好好的理學治療的地方，而可惜這些地方郤操之於外國人手内罷了！因爲中國醫界的倚賴性太重，創造性太差，總不肯奮勇地向前幹，於是這種治療完善的地方就缺乏了，外國醫生也就利用中國人的弱點，大大的抬高他的價值了！一次的治療費，千金萬金是可以聽他要的，因此享受這種治療的，僅僅乎祇有一班少數的貴族階級和資本階級，大多數的平民，在需要這種治療的時候，是只有東奔西問，在幾處設備不完全的地方試試罷了！</p>
<p>爲救濟這種社會上的畸形狀况起見，爲供給大多數的平民享受這種治療起見，近兩年來中國人所創辦的理學治療的地方，也有一兩處了！但是設備固然不全，手續尤其簡陋，即如愛克司光的照片，不是照的糢糊，就是說明没有，没有說明，病家那裏會知道呢？在這樣治如不治的情形之下，我們的病人們仍然是要忍着痛跑向外國人方面去的。</p>
<p>龐京周氏的主張，我們必定要實現的，但是我們理想中的理學治療院，是第一要合於價廉物美的條件的，我們創辦理學治療院，要抱着挽回利權，造福平民的宗旨，要脚踏實地的做去，纔能合於這「廉」「美」二字的條件。</p>
<p>好了！我們理想中的計劃實現了！震旦圖學會的同仁在巨籟達路體仁醫院裏附設了一個「上海理學診療院」了，診費固然訂的很低，器械也極其新式，設備很完備，尤其是技術的高妙，診斷的確實，中文說明書是極詳細的，醫師與管理者也都是專門而富有經騐的，這眞是我們享受這種治療的病人，尤其是平民的福音。同道們！假使有需要這種治療的病人，不妨介紹一試，也是指迷度世的天職，和挽回利權的機會啊！</p>

<h3>秋雨秋風</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>秋老了，又是這樣鬱悶，眞是不聽秋聲也是愁，那更兼風雨！</p>
<p>隨手在架上取書一册，一看乃是大宋宣和遺事，心裏已經有些悚然了。我一頁一頁地瞧下去；自道君微服私訪李師師起，直瞧到他死在均州土坑中，被金人以木杖貫尸，曳棄在另一石坑之中，尸身直下至坑底爲止，便不忍再讀下去了。最沈痛的，是他對欽宗這樣說：「吾祖宗二百年基業，一旦罹外國之腥膻，禍起奸臣之手，一家三千餘口……皆爲奴婢！」我忖著，我獨自忖著。這倒並不是悲秋。我的幽憤，除了哀雁寒蛩而外，恐怕要算那風和雨最能領會了；然而它們不幸，是日被喜歡賞月的文人雅士所詛咒的。</p>
<p>前幾天，日報告訴我們許多消息：什麽「方吉大舉進擾某地」哩：什麽「激戰一晝夜，砲火未停」哩：什麽「限於恊定，未能窮追」哩；什麽「人民逃避，情極狼狽」哩；什麽「日機擲彈，損失不明」哩：難道這些消息，眞應了那唐書裏「秋者天將摇落肅殺」的語讖麽？那麽，我們又詛咒那秋風秋雨做什麽呢！</p>
<p>「壯志飢餐胡虜肉，笑談渴飮匃奴血。」這是岳武穆滿江紅裏的壯語。念家山破一聲聲，銷盡湘纍多少涙，不要人聽」。這是朱古微自題庚子秋詞後浪淘沙中的哀鳴。一壯語，一哀鳴，我們讀了，作何感想，恐怕連那秋風秋雨也未必會領悟了。</p>
<h3>療飢方</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>「避穀仙丹」這句話，在往昔書籍的裏面，雖曾見過。但究是江湖術士惑人之談，不足憑信。近來德國有位博士新發明從棉子中提出一種滋養質，製成丸藥，說能補益身體，避穀療飢。在科學發達的今日，有這種驚人之事，也許是實在的。不過將來提煉成功，倘裝運來華，當作補品出售，每瓶需洋幾元幾角。那末，祗可供富貴人服用之避穀仙丹，不能作貧賤人服用之避穀仙丹。豈非反給洋大人發了財嗎？其實避穀療飢之方，我國未嘗没有。在下昨在故紙堆中，檢出一紙，還是清同治初年所印行。特開列於下：現在各省天災流行，哀鴻遍野。各界慈善家，若廣爲傳播。或製以賑濟飢民，較之施放錢米，更爲實惠而有益。再在顚沛流離的時候，當作乾糧，以備不時之需。那眞是救急活命的仙丹咧！</p>
<p>（一）芝蔴三升，糯米三升，俱水淘晒乾，文火炒，先將糯米磨粉，和入芝蔴，再磨，另用紅棗三斤，煑爛留汁肉，濾去皮核。與粉入石臼，同搗爲丸，如彈子大，約重五錢，白湯下。每服一丸，可耐一日飢，久服不餓。</p>
<p>（二）赤小豆升半炒，大黄豆升半焙，二味搗末，每服一合，日服三合，十日不飢。</p>
<p>（三）黄豆七升，芝蔴三升，水淘凈，即蒸，不可浸多時。蒸後，晒乾去殼，再蒸再晒，共三次。搗極透爲丸，如核桃大，每服一丸，可三日不飢。</p>
<p>（四）栗子，紅棗，胡桃，杮餅，四味去皮核，搗爛作餅，晒乾。日食一兩，則不知飢。</p>

<p>住在上海，富有之家，草地洋房之中，别說分有彈子房，酒排間，儲藏室，淴浴間，廚房間，汽車間，傭僕間；就是玻璃酒杯等器具，也佔着很大一間、這種公館有時進内跑上一個圈子，還不見人踪跡；其他設備自是備極舒服，什麽「騙阿拉」二萬惡淋」，單單無線電：會客室的十四燈機不足，少爺臥室有八燈的，小姐閨房有十二燈的；可是主人似乎很忙，甚少開聽時間而已！</p>
<p>他們的進欵，却又常常祇在一具電話中，閒話幾句，十萬八萬，收入尊册了。</p>
<p>和那一上一下，住了四五六家的一比較，更覺滑稽可笑，他們廚房便間都是假座了臥室，褲子短衫晒了一窗沿，藉代窗帘似的，孩子尿有繫到像萬國旗一連串不算，還有躺到客人足邊來；知道你朋友苦衷的：就不去拜訪爲妙。再說隔鄰不知如何，買了具四燈機，不怕費電，日中固然，夜裏二更半，也還是響個不完！累他失眠，遲到，罰薪，他說過好幾次要搬塌，祇因房租尚欠二個月，一時難以實行。</p>

<h3>吳淞之行</h3>
<p>— 趙子明</p>
<p>窄小的淞滬車，裝滿客人。在筆直的鐵軌上死命的奔馳。經過四層樓的帝國大兵壘，就看到頽垣的商務印書館。隆隆的車聲。唤醒沉寂的農村。</p>
<p>車廂裏有藍衣的工人，小脚的鄉下婆，站立的嬝嬝婷婷的女學生，英氣勃勃的男學生。在這時分不出你是先生，我是工人。大家都是站在一條平等線上。</p>
<p>車到終點丨「砲台灣。」隨着人潮湧出車門，看到屋頂大洞的車站，拆斷的電桿，槍彈洞穿的窗門，墻壁……怎不令人觸目驚心？</p>
<p>海面上白浪滾滾，提旁有對對的情侣；「良鄉栗子」壳和「天津雅梨。」狼藉滿地，男的放着喉嚨高唱：「楊延輝，坐宫院，自思自嘆……。」女的也和着：「寳寳要睡覺……」的催眠曲……同樣的潮水，不知他們當作海寗潮，還是黄河之潮？是來憑弔，還是取樂？</p>
<p>砲台是禁止參觀，上面有武裝戒備，一位女學生被兵阻止上去，伊說：「你們情願給日本人打，却不給中國人看！」此言可謂俏皮，然則亡亡羊補牢，未爲晚也！</p>
<p>秋風秋雨，綿綿終日，棉花歉收。三五位鄉下婆，披着藍布頭巾，赤着脚的在那邊採棉，聽他們談：「今年棉花嘸啥銷塲，洋棉花賤來唏！多來唏……」</p>
<p>燈火熒熒，秋蟲唧唧，吳淞的四圍，更形冷酷，悽凉……隆隆的火車，依然把我載回塵囂的都市。</p>

<p>當他下樓梯的時候，自己忽然省悟起來，怎麽回事？我這雙舊皮鞋，今天忽然緊束起來了。低頭看時，這才發現着，原來是把鞋子穿反了脚了。於是坐在樓梯上，把皮鞋脱下來挾着。换好了，提脚走了兩步，還是覺得鞋子夾脚。再仔細的看着，自己也不由得打了一個哈哈，原來在左脚上脱下來的皮鞋，依然還穿在左脚上。又二次的坐下來，把鞋子换着。换好了鞋子以後，自己坦然的下了樓了。王士立却由後面追上來道：連長到那裏去？趙自强道：到團部裏去呀。王士立道：您不戴了帽子去嗎？趙自强這才感到頭上是凉颸颸的。這是怎麽回事，今天的精神，却是這樣的彷彿顚倒，讓弟兄們知道了，那不成了一種笑話嗎？笑道：太忙了，忙得心裏亂七八糟，你把帽子扔給我罷。王士立雖不敢笑，心裏頭也是很納悶，送了帽給他，立刻回身走了。這情形恰是讓趙自强看見一點，他立刻挺了胸脯，扯了兩扯軍衣下擺，口裏唱着軍歌大開着步子，向團部裏走來。他没有走進門的時候，背上先足足的透了一陣熱汗，原來這一團的營連長，全到齊了，整整的圍了大餐桌子，左右兩方坐定，當自己要入座的時候，團長就出來了。團長先將各席上看了一遍，人數没有缺，這就問道：事情凖備得怎麽樣了？有一個營長站起來報告，大致都就緒了。團長這就挺了胸脯子道：我們這一團人，明天出發，現在有旅長的命令，拿去看。於是他在衣袋裏掬出一張命令，交給了手邊的營長。那命令如下。（二二○）</p>

<h3>兒童知識</h3>
<p>— 楚玉</p>
<p>攝取猛獸電影的方法　諸君常常看見猛獸的電影，可知道這種影片，是用什麽方法攝取來的呢？這恐怕諸君大都不明白的。我從前會見一位電影照相家，他和我說道：攝取猛獸電影，有幾種危險，就是猛獸所棲的地方，都在寒帶熱帶區域，或者因爲氣候酷熱以致攝影隊中暑患病的：或者因爲嚴寒凍斃氷雪中的；或者露宿荒野中，爲猛獸毒蛇所害的；或因交通不便，失足墮死的；或因乘小船渡河，爲鍔魚所襲，翻舟溺死的；種種危險，實在難以言語形容。前幾年英國某電影公司的攝影隊，隊員出發時，一共有二十八人，到了非洲猛獸境内去攝影，過了兩個月，生還者祇有三人。我們所看的幾張猛獸電影片子：如人獸奇觀；獸國春秋，等，差不多費了一二百萬的資本，犧牲了四五十人的生命所得的，但是我們在影片中，往往看到很吃緊的地方，這種片子，究竟是怎麽樣拍來的呢？現在我把朋友所說的，告訴諸君。他們攝取猛獸的方法：大約有三種：第一種爲自然攝影法；就是對於自然棲居的猛獸，隨便珀來的，這種方法，切不可爲猛獸看見，要秘密隱藏在岩谷森林中；爬到大樹上；等到猛獸出來的時候，利用望遠鏡，隨意拍來的。第二種爲攝影者先匿於鐵製的籠中，或在鐵栅欄後面，在猛獸時常出入的要口伺候，一人專司拍照；其他或探望四面；或手持刀槍以防猛獸襲來；這種攝影，非常危險，每有爲猛獸毒蛇咬殺的。第三種是率領勇敢的土人，備好槍械，冒險的到各處，去尋猛獸，倘與猛獸相遇，一面拍照；一面對準猛獸；非到萬分危險的時候，不胷發射，這樣與猛獸很接近的攝影，雖然十分危險，但是可以正面攝取猛獸的兇像，聽說猛獸中最兇悍的牛犀，常常劈面殺人。第四種爲反射經過攝影法；Ｐrocess這是因研究電影技術的進步，新發明的，就是應用光學，用望遠鏡，攝取實物，通過屏風Ｓcreen使實物反射到玻璃上，再由後面觀察實物，迅速的借望遠鏡攝取的。</p>
<p>▲人與猿　印度大學敎授凱洛克氏，爲試騐人與猿的智力，把自己生後十個月的嬰兒與生後七個月的黑猩猩Ｃhimpanzee比較的研究。（黑猩猩亦名類人猿，其容貌性能，與人類爲最近的）他把兩者各别的養在小室内，定好從什麽起頭，到什麽爲止的相當敎育的條件，最初先用吃飯的筷瓢等，逐一的依法分别敎授。隔了一星期，那黑猩猩自己就會使用了，而嬰兒祗能執瓢，不能握筷，且用瓢吃牛奶時，十瓢有九瓢，不到口邊，都傾覆在身上。凱洛克氏再敎以自己穿衣服的方法，用同樣的衣服，同法的指敎，過了一星期，那黑猩猩照樣的能夠穿好，而嬰兒還不明衣服的上下端，尋不到手袖與領口，祗把那衣服翻來覆去。其後再敎以吃茶的方法，黑猩猩不到第三日，就會正式的自飮了，而嬰兒過了一星期還拿不住茶杯，每次拿到茶杯，差不多没有接近口邊就大半傾覆了。凱洛克敎授又在記憶力上試騐，在室内裝置出入口，敎他們從東邊的進去，西邊的出來，嬰兒不到五分鎭，已記不清東西，兩口的方向黑猩猩雖過了三十分鐘，還辨得出的。凱氏就九個月試騐的結果，發表人與猿，在同一條件下敎育，不論智力，愛情，記憶力，都不及黑猩猩，不過言語方面，因猿類已經過了長年月的退化，總難以學像啊。自從這研究發表後，美國學者間，引起重大的衝動，大家都把各種類似的動物，好比狗與羊，牛與馬以及其他各種飛禽走獸，努力的比較試騐，以辨别動物靈性的高下。</p>

<h3>交通建設與國民經濟</h3>
<p>— 薛遺生</p>
<p>今日之中國，内伏農村經濟破産之危機，外感國際幣值跌落之壓迫，以致生産事業，奄奄一息，漏巵日巨，民生日蹙，有識之士，戚然憂之，於是紛倡救濟之議，或主統制經濟，以謀生産分配之均衡，或主膨脹通貨，以冀本國物價之抬高，宏論崇議，良堪欽佩。惟管見所及，以及值兹國内産業極度凋敝之秋，允宜對症發藥，作切實之規劃，若統制經濟與膨脹通貨，政策非不新頴，用意非不善美，然揆之吾國現狀，是否能見之實行，行之有效，殆均不無疑問。蓋吾國今日人民，依然如一盤散沙，卽以中央權力而言，亦尚不能遠及邊陲，試問須有全盤計劃之統制經濟，其將如何實施，卽姑令政治問題，不難立獲解决，然在地方自治尚未完成以前，一切調查統計，必均無從着手。而實施統制經濟，則不能不有精密之調查，與可恃之統計，以爲施設之準繩。今日雖己有一二統計，但除海關貿易册外，大致均不甚可靠，卽以人口一項而言，有調查爲四萬五千萬以上者，有調查爲四萬萬者，亦有調查爲不足四萬萬者，究竟實數若干，殊無人可以置答。至於耕地面積，及各項商品之産銷情形，更與實施統制經濟，所關綦巨，而現有之各項統計，亦復徒憑估計者多，精確調查者少，卽關册所載數字，因有免税及偷漏等關係，亦未必完全可靠。加以吾國政治未上軌道，民智尚未普及，人民對於官家之調查，難免疑慮横生，故卽向實地調查，亦未必遂可盡信，試問在此情形之下，統制經濟又如何能行之有效。藉曰吾人不能因噎廢食，則亦當勤求治理，以謀逐步之施設，而不宜操切從事，免致失信於人民。至若膨脹通貨，雖屬事較易行，然若謂僅藉通貨膨脹之力，以抬高物價之水準，卽可拯救國民經濟之危機，則事實恐無如此簡單。蓋增加通貨，雖足以刺激生産，然其刺激性，僅爲一時的而非永久的。况吾國物價低落之原因，並非由於通貨之缺乏，而乃由於人民購買力之减退。至人民購買力之所以减退，則其原因錯綜複雜，而銀價之跌落、亦未始非其癥結之一。理論上銀價低落，雖似可以促進輸出貿易，轉以增加人民之購買力，然以吾國生産事業之不發達，農産有餘而日用品之生産不足，仍不能不仰給於舶來品之輸入。卽本可自給之農産，亦以交通未闢，及運輸之不經濟，致需供未能適合，而有一方農産委棄於地，一方米麥大量輸入之矛盾現象。加以銀價低落，引起世界物價同情的低落，各國貨物，蓋不得不以吾國爲傾銷之尾閭。故以往數年中，銀價雖大跌特跌，而輸入依然不見减少，人民購買力依然不見增加，理論事實，無往而不顯呈其矛盾。今後應注重於事實之改善，使原可自給者，不必再仰給於人，不能自給者，亦設法可以自給，而後乃有計劃之可言。吾人非主張復返於閉關時代，特以國際合作，旣不可能，則惟有自給自足，乃能戰勝環境耳。</p>
<p>自給自足之義，在謀貨物之調節，與膨脹通貨注重貨幣之調節者不同。吾人固知膨脹通貨，其易十百倍於調節貨物，然證之已往之歷史，各國一度膨脹通貨，卽一度發生恐慌，前事斑斑，可爲殷鑒。卽以近例而言，倘膨脹通貨，果能復興經濟，則若英若法，歐戰後儘可安於跌價之貨幣，奚必苦心孤詣以謀回復金本位。美國最近停止金本位後，亦儘可利用紙幣政策，又奚必禁金出口，以保留多量存金於國内。且據吾人之觀察，最近之將來，金本位當有重光之一日。吾國此時採用膨脹政策，尤屬不切時宜。且徒膨脹通貨，而不求改良商貨之品質，减低生産之成本，則增加輸出，亦不可能。但若徒憑國内之消費，則如國内物價騰高之程度，超過國外幣價跌落之比例，恐曩之樂用國貨者，亦將轉而求之於洋貨。是其結果，反召輸入之增加，而仍無裨於生産之事業。且幣值减低後，不啻無形中削减資産階級之財富，因之消費亦必將隨之而縮减，於國民經濟之全體，亦未必得償所失。故雖以美國生産事業之發達，而膨脹計劃，猶在愼重考慮之中，而謂吾國産業幼穉，卽可藉膨脹通貨，以發展國民經濟，愚實未之敢信。愚以爲居今日而言調節生産，必須做到貨暢其流，地盡其利八字。而今日吾國貨流之所以不暢，地利之所以未盡，實由於交通機關之不健全，故與其由政府統制貨物之産銷，不如由國家致力交通之建設，請復得而申吾說。</p>
<p>（一）交通事業，爲一國之命脈。曩者葉譽虎氏有交通救國論之作，先總理亦有交通建設之計劃。蓋未有交通發達，而國運不蒸蒸日上者，證之獨立後之美國，維新後之日本，事實昭彰，不待煩言。故今後欲謀吾國國民經濟之繁榮，則開發交通，勢不可緩。</p>
<p>（二）吾國以農立國，糧食跌價，影響甚巨，而考糧食所以跌價之原因，則交通之阻梗，實爲一大癥結。蓋吾國之糧食問題，非收成荒歉之問題，而爲分配不均之問題。故雖值五穀豐登之年，而尚有洋米洋麥驚人之進口，果使交通便利，糧食自由流通，則進口自可减少，市價亦可維持，否則卽使高抬税率，恐亦於事無補，故苟言救濟農村，亦以發展交通爲第一要義。</p>
<p>（三）吾國幣制，素極紊辭，最近廢兩改元，雖已成功，然各地幣價，仍復參差不一，雖由於各地貨幣需供情形之不同，而運輸之不便，費用之昻貴，實爲其根本之原因。故欲平準各埠之幣價，調劑全國之金融，亦非發展交通事業不爲功，况交通便利，則商貨成本，可以减輕，營業利潤，亦可增加，金融界自可安心放欵，因此市面亦不難漸臻於繁榮。</p>
<p>（四）吾國天賦寳藏，都未開闢，然空言開闢，而不先發展交通，則人民習於偷安，又孰肯冒萬險以深入不毛之境者。故因勢利導，亟宜使幽遠偏僻之區，與通都大邑，打成一片，然後再設法奬勵人民之移殖，自事半而功倍。且開發交通，工程浩大，旣可增加二人工作之機會，又可消納社會夫業之人口，誠一舉而數善備焉。</p>
<p>（五）年來吾國内戰頻仍，影響於生産事業者，誠非淺鮮。考其原因，乃由於羣雄之割據，而亦由於交通之不便，遂致中央權力，鞭長莫及，離叛變亂，層出不窮。故今後欲謀整個社會之安定，使人民得告安居樂業，市面金融不再蒙戰亂之影響！則尤非致力於交通建設不可。</p>
<p>雖然欲圖交通建設之完成，非政府與金融界通力合作不爲功，方今金融界正苦深資充斥，無法運用，果使政府對於交通事業，有整個之計劃！建設之决心，諒金融界亦必樂於贊助，交通救國，胥在此輩，望有謀國之責者，熟利圖之。</p>
<h3>棉業推廣之步驟</h3>
<p>— 方君强</p>
<p>棉之爲用至溥，而棉業之盛衰，影響於國計民生者尤大。夷考我國棉業之失敗，癥結所在，不外下列諸端；</p>
<p>（二）政府對於棉業無整個奬進及救濟計劃，棉農，棉商，及紡織業者，各以個人利益爲前提，缺乏互助合作精神。（二）棉農知識愚陋，不圖改進，所植土棉！絨短質劣，已不適於今日機械化紡織業之需要，因而銷路日蹙，産量日减。（三）棉商眼光短弱，昧於近利，以短絨土棉，便於攙水，廣事買收，旣損棉買。復使細絨良種無法勸種。（四）紡織業因土棉不適用，又不奬掖棉農改種良棉，惟仰給其原料於外人，一受外商操縱，成本頓時高漲，同時工廠之管理不得法，工人之訓練不足，生産費加重；華商各廠，彼此間復少聯絡，一經外貨之傾銷，與躉拚，」乃紛紛虧折而停業。</p>
<p>綜上四因，乃造成今日華棉不夠用，不適用，與華商紡織業崩潰之結果。去年全國棉産，較民七减少三百餘萬担，紗廠之運轉錠數，較民十三减去三分之一，洋棉及棉貨之輪入，年達五萬八千萬元之鉅，漏巵不塞丨國將不國，初無待乎帝國主義者之飛機大砲制我人死命而後然也。然則救濟之道，又將奚出？曰，解鈴繫鈴！捨吾政府，紡織業，棉商，棉農，一致覺悟，通力合作，以推廣棉業外，别無他策。吾人當集中政府及紡織業之財力與人力，以促棉農棉商之覺悟，及其改進之决心，然後聯合一致，使棉業生産趨於合理化。調查各省棉産及風土荒地情形，開拓棉田，以增加産量，使國人有敷用之棉，然後可以杜外棉之輸入。普設棉業改良塲，蕃殖細絨良棉，實行地方純種主義，訂定棉花品級標準，厲禁做潮及摻雜惡習，以改進品質，使紡織業有可用之原料，製廉價之細布，然後可以制舶來棉貨之貨銷。更設軋花及榨油廠，以减輕棉農之勞力，且以絕惡劣棉種之流傳。設棉花倉庫及打包廠，以便棉農之存貯運輸，且以杜棉花之做潮與摻雜。設棉農貸欵處，及合作指導所，以救濟棉農之經濟，且以防花行之壟斷。提倡棉農義敎，舉辦棉業示範會，以增進棉農之植棉知識及技術。實行全國棉産及棉業賃易之調查及估計，按時公佈，以供棉商及紡織業之參考。組織全國及各地之紡織業聯合會，切守團結，以抵抗外商之侵略與壓迫。運用保護關税政策，提高進口税，課收傾銷税，取締外商在華設廠，然後中國棉業之復興，庶幾有豸，兹就管見所及，擬定推廣步驟，分下列四期。</p>
<p>第一期</p>
<p>（一）舉辦各省棉業調查　由各省農政機關主辦，注重棉田畝數，棉花産量，棉花品種，可推廣棉業之荒地畝數，地方風土，及交通概况等項，並附帶調查農村經濟，農民生活，主要農産狀况。</p>
<p>（二）擬定各省開拓棉田實施計劃　各省農政首腦機關，根據調查結果，會同當地高級農業敎育機關，及棉業專家，擬定本省增殖棉田實施方案，並由農政當局，要求紡織業投資，預備開墾經費。</p>

<h3>漁業有統制之必要</h3>
<p>— 屈若搴</p>
<p>目前經濟統制之呼聲，瀰滿社會，自宋部長歸國發表統制之言論後，卽有經濟委員會擴大之事實，此所以應時勢之要求，挽救危殆於萬一者也。吾國實行經濟統制，自在各項事業之個别統制，故經濟委員會乃有糧食，棉花，煤業，絲業，礦業等統制會之組織，而對於生計乘絕占民食重要地位之漁業，尚未得政府之注意，安得不一言而申其說乎？</p>
<p>吾國漁業之衰頽，已達極點，内而漁村破産，海盜蠭起，外而鄰國侵漁，盡量傾銷。衰敗之由，正爲綿長萬里之海岸線與夫數百萬之漁民，歷來缺乏管理，失所指導，漁民知識，依然固陋，捕漁舊法，不謀改進。採捕祗知集中一處，遂以濫捕之結果，致使漁獲逐漸减退，生産日微。所捕魚鮮，又以製法不精，難於持久，而不能行銷遠方，獲利至艱。漁商販運，亦祗知銷運一地，譬諸上海爲歷史上漁産銷售地，於是不論貨品之好劣多寡，市塲之供求盈虚，羣以滬上爲唯一銷地，而不知擇地擇價以行銷，魚價時有暴落之危機，再以市場之中，外國水産喧賓奪主，復運用其傾銷手段，貶低價格，擾亂魚市，使吾漁産，亦不得不降價求售，多受損失，卽所以制吾漁民之死命。加之土劣之榨取，官商之壓迫，漁民乃有棄其罟網，善良者向都市謀生活，桀鰲者流而爲海匪，作業者祇餘老弱，苟延殘喘，漁業生産，自然薄弱。生産旣薄弱，更予外貨以傾銷之機會，外貨傾銷，漁民更難生存，流而爲盜，海盜縱横，則生産更微，循環往復，相爲因果，此吾國漁業之日趨衰頽，乃有今日不可收拾之狀也，設再因循坐視，不加補救，不數年間吾國漁民旣無一線生機，海　之不安謐，亦恐視今日爲甚也。</p>
<p>吾國漁業，誠如一般人所謂尚屬幼稚時期、但如何可以促其改進，助其發展，是誠吾人亟應注意之點也。蓋吾國沿海村鎭，全爲漁民集中之處，天然資源，絕形豐富，所以奄奄就斃者，正爲缺乏統制，致散漫不堪，旣不知改進技術，又動輙分帮械鬥，江浙外海，雖有各項漁業公所之組織，但其成績，祇向漁民收取金錢，並無改進漁業之功用。至漁民自身，則蚩愚桀鰲，對其事業可謂一無認識，一旦漁獲豐足，金錢到手，則狂賭瀘嫖；一旦生産不足，資本虧蝕，則聚衆刦物，到處騷擾，凡此情狀，試一赴外海各島，便能歷歷在目，漁業之所以不能進步者，實由於此。是以必須組織各項合理化之漁業組合，辦理漁民敎育，調查漁村經濟，爲之謀根本改善，故非有强有力之統制機關，經過詳實調查，精密計劃，不克奏效，若徒唱保護漁民之空調，曷克濟事。</p>
<p>再如運銷，實亦不能不加以統制。蓋吾國魚商，祇向平素銷售之集散地輸送，不問該地之需要如何？亦不思向内地推銷之利益如何？如何事可以全部出售？如何事可以安定價格？漠然不知。毫不計及。卽如去年之默魚鮝商人，在嵊山一帶收取之墨魚鮝，全數運滬；而舟山羣島之産品，則由寗波各墨魚鮝行收集，皆以各自盲目營業之故，毫無聯絡，致銷路停滯，貨品廢棄頗多，作者今春赴各島調查，過甬曾晤該業中人，俱云年來生意惡劣，全年營業，甬地行家共祗三四十萬元，去年銷路之狹，使貨品堆存頗多，大有束手待斃之情况；而考之去年舶來水産品之輸入，卽以日本産墨魚乾而論，其銷售於吾國者，已達一萬一千四百七十九擔，價值三十二萬九千四百八十九金單位，約合國幣六十萬元，其數值之可驚，可見國内市塲對墨魚乾需要正殷，正爲吾國魚商不知運銷之故，而有此損失。（今年墨魚鮝商人仍形虧本但至今尚無正確統計與調查）故運銷若有統制，則此弊當然可免。</p>
<p>更有進者，吾國之水産貿易，始終爲入超之現象，而年來日貨之傾銷，更足以摧殘吾國漁業之生存。雖國人對日本水産品，具有戒心，然一般貿易商人，反因此改换標記，冒稱國貨，或竟偷運進口，私銷内地，而坐享大利。此誠漁業前途之最大障礙，如能有統制貿易之機關，則海味行商，在統制之下，不克自由賣買，故卽使日産之如何跌價，亦難獲得買主，若竟自行運來吾國，亦必爲與消費者直接交易之困難，斷不能如目下之暢銷，故統制以後，卽使不能切實使貿易商之不自由買賣，然最低當獲有精確之統計，則可審定國内供需之情形，必能使輸入有相當之節制，以免外國水産品之大量輸入，而直接影響於國内産業之生存。</p>
<p>且實施統制以後，可作各方之詳密研究，如某項産品，吾國之生産如何？需要如何？對内地之運銷如何？外國輸入之數值如何？侵害吾國之程度如何？抵制之方策如何？以及振興吾國水産業之手段如何。凡此諸問題，皆能於精密調查計劃以後，予以一一解答，則漁業之復興，庶有希望，且今人所謂防止海盜，確屬當務之急，但此乃治標方策之一端。吾人前已言之，海盜之發生，大都由漁民受種種壓迫而出此，故能融通水産經濟，安定漁民生活，則海洋自能安靖，漁業自能振興，是以欲謀漁業之復興，必成於漁業之統制也。</p>
<p>至於處今日而言新式漁輪業之發展，則亦爲振興漁業急切要圖之一，但尚有種種問題在，作者於此，不　多所論列。惟以起漁業於垂死之地步，非加以統制不爲功也。</p>

<h3>外國也有</h3>
<p>— 符靈</p>
<p>凡中國所有的，外國也都有。</p>
<p>外國人說中國多臭蟲，但西洋也有臭蟲，日本人笑中國人弄文字，但日本人也一樣的弄文字。不抵抗的有甘地；禁打外人的有希特拉；狄昆希吸鴉片；陀思妥夫斯基賭得發昏。斯惠夫德帶枷，馬克斯反動。林白大佐的兒子，就給綁匪綁去了。而裹脚和高跟鞋，相差也不見得有多麽遠。</p>
<p>只有外國人說我們不問公益，只知自利，愛金錢，却還没法辯解。民國以來，有過許多總統和闊官了，下野之後，都是面團團的，或賦詩，或看戲，或吟佛，喫着不盡，眞也好像給批評者以證據。不料今天却被我發見了：外國也有的！</p>
<p>『十七日哈伐那電丨丨避居加拿大之古巴前總統麥查度……在古巴之産業，計值八百萬美元，凡能對渠担保收回此項財産者，無論何人，渠願與以援助。又一消息，謂古巴政府已對麥及其舊僚屬三十八人下逮捕令，並扣押渠等之財産，其數達二千五百萬美元。……』</p>
<p>以三十八人之多，而財産一共祇有區區二千五百萬美元，手段雖不能謂之高，但有些近乎發財却總是確鑿的。</p>
<p>假使世界上祇有一家有臭蟲，而遭别人指摘的時候，實在也不大舒服的，但捉起來却也眞費事。况且北京有一種學說，說臭蟲是捉不得的，越捉越多。即使捉盡了，又有什麽價值呢，不過是消極的辦法。最好還是希望别家也有臭蟲，而竟發見了就更好。發見，這是積極的事業。哥崙布與愛迪生，也不過有了發見或發明而已。</p>
<p>與其勞心勞力，不如玩跳舞，喝咖啡，外國也有的，巴黎就有許多跳舞塲，和咖啡店。</p>
<h3>再論「文選」</h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>爲了當時寫信的習慣，下筆便須描寫月令物色一番，蕭統就製作了十二月啟，以爲這種文字的公式。爲了當時公牘文字的能手不多，任昉陸倕就算是這種文章之冠冕，蕭統就撰集古今典誥文言，成爲正序一書，以爲公文程式。爲了五言詩是當時一種最流行的詩體，蕭統就選五言之善者，成爲文章英華一書，其實，應該呌做模範詩選。倘若說詩經尚書都是經過孔子之手，選輯而成的話，那麽，蕭統算是孔子第二了。這位孔子第二，也正是聖之時者也，他選輯的幾部書，都帶有很濃厚的時代色彩，都算是他那一個時代的時髦東西。正序和文章英華的至今不傳，想是時代淘洗的結果罷。只有文選存在至今，還有一位當代有名的作者施蟄存先生，要推薦給青年，作爲文學修養之根基，這不能不算是這部書的好運道了。</p>
<p>誰也知道「文起八代之衰」的是韓愈，可是有一位享盡高夀大名的選學家，他想「文復八代之盛」。他「覺得五十年來事事新」，文選讀膩了，也許太舊了罷，他就重新選一部八代文粹，又選一部八代詩選，去敎他的門弟子，果然他的門弟子們就拿這兩部書當寳典，這一批文學家，我們應該呌他們做「新選學派」。這派的開山祖師究竟是誰？便是死去還不算久遠的吾鄉先哲王湘綺先生。他老先生幾乎一脚把「舊選學派」踢翻，讓「新選學派」獨覇文壇。不料他的願力雖宏，恰和他的再傳弟子，提倡「新孔學」的康有爲一樣。新的還没有站得住脚倒連舊的給他踢翻了也爬不起來，這豈不是糟天下之大糕嗎？</p>
<p>我想，這眞是一樁奇怪的事，以施蟄存先生那樣有名的現代小說作家，要推薦文選這部書給青年，作爲「文學修養之根基」，這猶之林語堂先生勸人讀論語，不過幽默而已，倒没有什麽。倘若竟有爲文「拙直」，爲人也「拙直」的青年，相信施先生的話，想從文選「參悟一點做文章的作法」，「擴大一點字彙」，得毋賊夫人之子也夫！但在另一方面說，不僅舊選學派當有文章中興，吾道不孤之感，就是新選學派也許雀躍三百，希望文復八代之盛，因爲同屬選學，無論新舊，其揆一也。</p>
<p>雖然，文選這部書能夠存在到如今，自然也有它的不可磨滅的地方。蕭統說：</p>
<p>自姬漢以來，眇焉悠邈，時更七代，數逾千祀。詞人才子，則名溢於縹曩；飛文染翰，則卷盈乎緗帙。自非略其蕪穢，集其清英，蓋欲兼功，太半難矣。</p>
<p>可知文選是一部七代文之精選。其中詩也有，賦也有，其他各種文體也大半都有。駢文家把它當作寶典，固然不在說；就是看不起八代之文的唐宋古文家，也未嘗不要讀它。等而下之，至於明清兩代的八股文人，也得從文選參悟一點作文的方法，擴大一點字彙，所以有「文選爛，秀才半；四書熟，秀才足，」的語訣。不幸時代大變了，文學也大變了，駢文古文同時倒霉，白話文學代之而起。「選學妖孽，桐城謬種」敵不過文學革命先驅者的法寳，久已銷聲匿跡，從此文選就不必列爲青年必讀書了罷？</p>
<h3>談麥綏萊勒木刻連環圖畫</h3>
<p>— 李平</p>
<p>我想把外國的木刻連環圖畫，介紹到中國來，要以良友公司翻印麥綏萊勒的作品爲第一次吧。麥綏萊勒是一個有名的比利時的木刻畫家。他除曾替幾部名著作揷畫，和零星的在報上發表作品之外，還作了幾部没字的連環畫本。這次良友公司所選印的是他最有名的四種：（一）一個人的受難，（二）光明的追求，（三）我的懺悔，（四）没有字的故事。其中只有一個人的受難，和我的懺悔是寫實的。一個人的受難是叙述一個勞働者，怎樣從流浪孩起一直受難到死。雖然僅僅二十來幅的畫面，然而它的表現是那麽深刻有力。尤其是明顯的黑白的對照，和一種巧妙的比喻，（如在第六幅他被人踢出像打跑了條野狗一樣）使你一看之後便會留下不可磨滅的印像。我的懺悔雖帶點作者個人自述的性質，然而他的遭遇，思想，墮落，革命，憤怒，和對於現社會的不平，都恰似波浪一般在這百多幅的木刻上起伏着。麥綏萊勒有些作品是極其離奇而富於想像的。這在光明的追求中就可見到。光明的追求原名呌做太陽，内中說一個人想達到太陽，他用種種的方法去追求，可是他處處失敗。爲什麽光明的追求者要這樣地處處踫壁呢？我想這或許就是作者所亟亟於告訴我們的吧。麥綏萊勒不僅有純熟的木刻地技巧，而且他有豐富的人生經騐，他能夠將他的感覺與經騐，用他的天才的刀法，運刻在木頭上四週經過了墨色的塗抹，然後再翻印在白紙上，雖然没有字，可是你看了之後，恰如讀了世界上最著名的文藝創作一般。没有字的故事不僅有好的内容，而且因着他天才的技巧，使文字所不能傳達的情感，也能表現在這黑白的畫面上。</p>
<h3>撲空</h3>
<p>— 豐之餘</p>
<p>自從「自由談」上發表了我的「感舊」和施蟄存先生的「莊子與文選」以後，「大晚報」的「火炬」便在徵求展開的討論。首先徵到的是施先生的一封信，題目曰「推薦者的立場」，注云「莊子與文選的論爭」。</p>
<p>但施先生又並不願意「論爭」，他以爲兩人作戰，正如弧光燈下的拳擊手·無非給看客好玩。這是很聰明的見解，我贊成這一肢一節。不過更聰明的是施先生其實並非眞没有動手，他在未說退塲白之前，早巳揮了幾拳了，揮了之後，飄然遠引，倒是最超脱的拳法。現在只剩下一個我了，却還得回一手，但對面没人也不要緊，我算是在打「逍遥遊」。</p>
<p>施先生開首就說我加以「訓誨」，而且派他爲「遺少的一肢一節」。上一句是誣賴的，我的文章中，並未對於他個人有所勸告。至於指爲「遺少的一肢一節」，却誠然有這意思，不過我的意思，是以爲「遺少」也並非怎麽很壞的人物。新文學和舊文學中間難有截然的分界，施先生是承認的，辛亥革命去今不過二十二年，則民國人中帶些遺少氣，遺老氣，甚而至於封建氣，也還不算大怪事，更何况如施先生自己所說，「雖然不敢自認爲遺少，但的確已消失了少年的活力」的呢，過去的餘氣當然要有的。但是，只要自己知道，别人知道，能少傳授一點，那就好了。</p>
<p>我早經聲明，先前的文字是並非專爲他個人而作的，而且自看了「莊子與文選」之後，則連這「一肢一節」也巳經疏遠。爲什麽呢，因爲在推薦給青年的幾部書目上，還題出着别一個極有意味的問題：其中有一種是「顔氏家訓」。這「家訓」的作者，生當亂世，由齊入隋，一直是胡勢大張的時候，他在那書裏，也談古典，論文章，儒士似的，却又歸心於佛，而對於子弟，則願意他們學鮮卑語，彈琵琶，以服事貴人丨胡人。這也是庚子義和拳敗後的達官，富翁，巨商，士人的思想，自己吟佛，子弟却學些「洋務」，使將來可以事人：便是現在，抱這樣思想的人恐怕還不少。而這顔氏的渡世法，竟打動了施先生的心了，還推荐於青年，算是「道德修養」。他又舉出自己在讀的書籍，是一部英文和一部佛經，正爲「鮮卑語」和「歸心篇」寫照。只是現代變化急速，没有前人的悠閑，新舊之爭，又正劇烈，一下子看不出頭緒，他就也只好將先前兩代的「道德」，並萃於一身了。假使青年，中年，老年，有着這顔氏式道德者多，則在中國社會上，實是一個嚴重的問題，有蕩滌的必要。自然，這雖爲書目所引起，問題是不專在於個人的，這是時代思潮的一部。但因爲連帶提出，表面上似有太關涉了某一個人之觀，我便不敢論及了，可以和他相關的只有「勸人看莊子文選了」八個字，對於個人，恐怕還不能算是不敬的。但待到看了「莊子與文選」，却實在生了一點不敬之心，因爲他辯駁的話比我所豫料的還空虚，但仍給以正經的答覆，那便是「感舊以後」上。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（六）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>羅蘭太太是一個四十八歳而外表還看不出有這樣年紀的女人，她對於這次的海游和這落日的美景，好像比誰都感覺快樂。</p>
<p>她那褐色的頭髮還才開始變白。她有着一副沉着而有理性的臉孔，一副快樂和善逗人喜歡的臉孔。照她的兒子筆爾的話說來，她是懂得銀錢的價值的，可是這事並不妨害她領略夢想的風味。她歡喜讀小說和詩，這不是爲着它們的藝術價值，而是因爲它們能使她興起一些憂鬱而又温柔的沉思。據她說，一句詩，常是一句平凡的不好的詩，也使得小小的心弦顫動，而她覺得幾乎實現了一個神秘的願望。她很樂於消受這類輕微的感動，這類使得她那像一本賬簿一樣的有條理的心情稍稍擾亂的感動。</p>
<p>自從她來到哈佛爾以後，她顯着的發胖起來，她從前那非常苗條，非常婀娜的身材，因此日漸隆重。</p>
<p>這次海上的游玩使她非常快樂。她的丈夫並不是惡人，但虐待她正如那些小店裏的暴君無怒無恨地虐待别人一樣，在這些暴君，指揮就等於發誓。當着一切陌生人，他矜持着，但在家裏，他便放任起來並使出種種駭人的樣子，雖然他其實是什麽人都害怕的。她呢，因爲最怕吵鬧和無用的解釋，老是讓步着，從來不曾有所要求；因此，好久以來，她不敢再要羅蘭帶她到海上去游散了。所以她這次很欣喜地抓着這機會，她享受着這稀有的新的樂趣。</p>
<p>從出發以來，她便把整個身子，精神和肉體兩方面，都沉浸在這温柔的水上的滑走裏。她什麽都不想，摒去一切回憶和希望，她覺得她的心像她的身子一樣，飄浮在一種柔軟的，流動的，美妙的東西上面，這東西摇着她，使她昏昏然。</p>
<p>當爸爸吩咐歸航時說：「喂，坐在划槳的地方罷！」她便微笑着瞧着她的孩子們，她那兩個大孩子，把他們的衣裳脱去，把襯衫的袖子捲在赤裸裸的手臂上。</p>
<p>靠近兩個女人坐着的筆爾抓着右邊的槳，哲安抓着左邊的槳，他們等着主人呌說：「一齊向前！」因爲照主人的意思，駛船的動作是必須有規則地執行的。</p>
<p>以同樣的努力，他們一齊把槳打入水中，隨後將身子向後仰倒並盡力把槳往前划去；於是爲表現他們的精力起見，開始了一個鬭爭。他們來時原時楊着帆緩緩駛來的，但現在風已息了，而兩兄弟的那種男性的驕傲却忽然覺醒過來，想要互爭雄長。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>騎牆進階</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>不久以前，曾在本刋發表了一篇「說騎牆」，有過候補「騎牆進階」的預告，本文就是我底履約。</p>
<p>前文有過這麽幾句：「話雖如此，有時候却也出亂子，因爲到底雙脚兩邊踏，自己也頗賣力，脚跟來一個痙孿兒，騎的工夫漲滿了，就難免跌翻一交」。惟其如此，所以這不是一躍可蹴，需要一番頂天的修養，也就是騎牆自有進階。</p>
<p>可是話又說回，騎牆雖已成了一種廣遍的人生哲學，却又不是凡屬方趾圓顱者所能染指冒牌，也就是說傻裏傻氣的人萬難施其效顰。要想騎牆，雖無用天生麗質，却確確實實要幅透頂的聰明，像猴猻那樣的靈活，像貓兒那樣的夜明珠，像老鼠那樣的狡黠和敏銳的聽覺，像花狗那樣的會跳，總之是要聰明過人，這才有份兒，這才能夠如願以償。</p>
<p>然後且談進階：</p>
<p>獨一步，何不要忘記了人生的大前提丨丨利慾的追索，一個人忙來忙去，無非想掙幾隻老洋，在這佔有爲尚的年代裏，有錢便是好漢，手心裏端的是老洋，生活上就會晃動無數的花簇，人壽短短的，照理也該當享受享受。所以利慾是第一着，乾脆此說，也就是首先應顧及到老洋。站在老洋跟後的種種享樂的方式如摟女人坐汽車等等，恐多牽涉，暫均「帶住」。</p>
<p>其次也需要眞實的本領，不過這不是指什麽鳥的學問而言，而是要精密而遠大的眼光，把潮流弄得分明，把世情看得透澈，不要太前進，也不能太落後，務要高瞻遠矚，隨機應變，比如說在某個時候Ｘ先生頗能號召一部份瞎眼的羣衆，非常「捧紅」你就須觀察得到這是Ｘ先生的時代，於是你可踏上一隻脚。同時候Ｘ先生的新藥也在貼廣告了，算得凖，這同樣有一個轟動的時期到臨，你也須像孔明老師一樣，來一番透澈的估計，行動也就可跟搭上Ｘ先生的新號召，所以目光務要精密而遠大。</p>
<p>再近一步的話，你就得套上「跳加官」似的面幕，迴腸似的腦腺，這麽一篇議論，會顯得出你是幹練忠實，那麽翻一幅臉，又題得出你是幹練忠實，落在匪窟，你說這是窮人當正的出路，高踞法壇，你說盜匪之刑，死有餘辜，說得出這麽一個立塲，也說得出那麽一套是非，嘴巴像留聲機一樣，開一張愛情名曲，又一張佛老誦經。總之是需要假就假，能哭能笑，只不過在轉舵的時候，當心破綻，其實也無妨。這樣你的脚自然隨踏就穩。</p>
<p>此外呢，還需要一般的拍馬與吹牛，逢上就緊緊的拍，逢下就放肆的吹，這巳是老門檻，陳調兒了，毋庸多所闡述。</p>
<p>最後倒還要補說兩種反尅：第一最忌所謂「氣節」，這是昔人所重，今之所非者矣，你不要固執什麽鳥的主張，鳥的人格；主張，人格都是那麽虚無抽象，你可搬運你的偉大的前程來抵擋牠，看牠會不會蔴不可當，蕩然掃地。第二最忌所謂「良心」，這，原也是一個不中用的名詞，你無須顧及這麽許多，只要手段拿得出，目的達得到，騎東也好，騎西也好，殺人也好，縱火也好，總算了事。</p>
<p>失眠的頭腦，脹痛欲裂，燃起一枝烟，看着時計巳是薄曉五時了，北站的火車已發動了洪大的晨班汽笛，「騎牆進階」竟。</p>

<h3>期待</h3>
<p>— 紹淵</p>
<p>是隂沉沉的天氣，好像是想下雨，整個的大自然都沉浸在灰色的宇宙恒抱裏。</p>
<p>他兩眼怔怔地望着窗外，坐在籐椅上面，兩手分開擺在左右，虔誠地在沉默着。</p>
<p>丨丨唔丨這樓梯響的聲音就恐怕是她了。他側着頭聽着下面上的樓梯聲。</p>
<p>然而，只是使他焦急，失望。每次噠噠噠的樓梯聲，不是走到二樓歇住了，就是直跑上四樓去的。</p>
<p>丨丨嗤丨這個的不是丨那個也不是丨</p>
<p>他站起來，打了一個圈。向四週望望，房子的佈置，是這樣摩登化，藝術化，尤其是最使他歡心的，是擺在案上的兩朶鮮花，放出芬芳的氣味來，是這樣有雙有對。於是他憧憬着，也許未來的他和她的象徵吧。他向着那兩朶美麗的花歡笑，舞眉。</p>
<p>噠，噠，噠！下面的樓梯聲又響起來了。他靜靜地反過頭來望着房門的動靜，結果又是跑上晒臺上去的娘姨，他恨她，恨不得把她殺死，怎麽老是這樣跑上跑下呢？</p>
<p>丨丨難道她失約了嗎？再不然忘記了嗎？不，不，絕對不會失約，忘記的。昨天也還接她一封信哩！也許她没有下課？也許她被女伴所覊累？也許她現正是在途中？也許…………</p>
<p>他的思潮如浪濤般洶湧着。</p>
<p>又是打了幾個圈。五分鐘過後，仍然是茫無人影。他探頭到窗外去。只看見下面衖堂裏往來三三五五的陌生人。他又回轉頭來，望望案頭的時鐘，已指着五鐘三十五分了。他疑午鐘是走得太快，不凖確。然而，窗外似乎是漸漸地黯淡起來了。暮爲籠罩整個大地了。</p>
<p>他急煞了。再也不能等了。他想跑到學校裏去打電話。究竟是怎樣一回事呢？</p>
<p>「喂！找誰？」</p>
<p>「找密司ＸＸＸ」</p>
<p>「好！請你等一等啊！」</p>
<p>「唔！」</p>
<p>他心裏是這樣忐忑着期待着在這刹那的一間。</p>
<p>「喂丨ＸＸＸ女士出去了！」</p>
<p>好像上天起了霹靂一般，他呆住了。把電筒掛上去，垂頭喪氣走出校門。　　丨丨也許她巳經在我家裏等我了哪！</p>
<p>一種熱望又想起來，匆匆忙忙跑回家來，最先在下面詢問一回，然後直跑上房裏來。把房門推開，一種沉悶的氣味與熱望的空虚騰滿了他的團團……</p>
<p>窗外是越發黑了！慘淡的街燈射進微光來，遠處傳來工廠裏的氣笛聲，買報聲，……</p>
<p>一九三三，九，二九夜，</p>
<h3>夢中三個階段</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>昨天到上海去，看見馬路裏，東也「航空奬劵五十萬元」。西也「航空奬劵五十萬元」，看得心花潦亂，神思恍盪，打算吃中飯，竟跑錯了冥洋店裏去，直是財迷心竅了。入夜來就此做了一夢。</p>
<p>夢見我買的「六零六」航空奬券，竟得中了頭奬了，往中央銀洋領得奬金五十萬元，回到家裏來，歡天喜地，非但老母嬌妻，含笑相迎，並且銀行裏，還派了四個一向使我見了，心中有些駭怕的大兵，掛了盒子砲，用「雪佛蘭」一九三三新汽車，護送我回府，一路上，看的人，人山人海，都在讚美我福份大，使我臉上飛金，眞是我有生以來，破題兒第一遭的，快樂，榮耀，風頭，闊綽，和得意了。</p>
<p>有了錢，案向見我避之惟恐不及的，高親貴戚，竟不約而同的，都來拜望我了。最使我喜出望外的：就是一位三年前要求我買一只鑽戒，我没買給她，因而愛情剖裂的情人，金是愛女士，也打扮得花枝招展地，從路遠迢迢的南京，特地趕來和我過喜，隨身還帶來了，許許多多使我呌不出名稱的，貴重物品，並殷勤地，問我三年來身體的健康，吾極力地，道着她前回爲我不買鑽戒，而使她賭氣憤走的歉意。兩個誘惑的，醉人心靈的，迷人的酒渦，又和我輕輕地，嫣然一笑，我的身子，淘醉得不能自主了，突然上前摟住她，接了一個甜密的吻，這時，三年前温存的夢境，又在我的腦底迅速地出現了。這天我見親朋的紛至沓來，也就覺得我的屋子太陋，一切器具的太蹩脚了，不但對不起這般高貴的親友，簡直我現在是一個五十萬大富翁，也覺得太不像樣了，於是馬上託了一個地産公司經理的親戚，立刻代我包造了一座精緻的小洋房，柚木器具和銅床錦被，他也一手包辦的和我佈置妥當　不勞我自己一點費心，這是他多麽地熱心啦。小張善迎人意，還替我覓了三位絕色的姨太太。喬遷新第的那天，佳賓滿座，樂聲鏗鏘，嬌妻美妾，又緊張地環侍左右，使我享盡人生幸福，樂得笑了嘴合不攏來。</p>
<p>一因親友勸我，現在時世不好，外面綁風甚熾，出門須格外當心；二因面團團的富家翁的身價，自己當然要裝重些，所以就買了一輛嶄新的汽車代步。那知我和嬌妻美妾，左擁右抱的，駕車兜風，就惹起了綁匪的垂涎，Ｘ日深夜，我和三姨太太，剛從ＸＸ舞場，舞罷歸來，汽過ＸＸＸ路，突然路旁竄出三位惡狠狠的仁兄，袖出手槍，奪車而去，架至匪窟，他們丨匪丨追我寫五十萬元信催贖，我想好容易得了一個頭奬，頓成暴富，現在迫我全部交出，我的洋房美妾，一旦化爲烏有，仍做一個貧民，那麽五十萬元，豈非黄梁一夢？所以抵死不從，那知他們的槍，對我瞄凖了，不從又恐性命危險，於是心中一急，一個驚嚇，突然醒覺，原來是南柯一夢。</p>
<h3>「怎樣做人」</h3>
<p>— 從雲</p>
<p>『怎樣做人』？换言之，『就是怎樣在時代中生存』？的確，生在這個時代，不懂一些做『人』的門徑，那就一輩子凖没發達，不過這是『人上人』，『普通人』以下的『人』，也就例外咧！</p>
<p>這般說來，『做人』是一件最難的事了？不，祗要你厚着臉去幹，也有發達的一天，然而臉又怎樣厚呢？不希罕，祗要步着她們的後塵依法行去，包管就得咧！</p>
<p>女人丨丨萬世所崇拜的，不論在什麽時代都是這樣，不過在這個時代，　處理代』　　　　　　　　　　　　　。</p>
<p>自古至今約　　子，殺人不眨眼的魔王，祗要一到她們的眼前，她們的手裏，就會無力地醉酥起來了！她們是玩的那忽兒把戲呢？定而言之精而確之的話一句，還不是擒縱政策麽？在你不快意，灰心的時候，她來熖媚你一下子，等你精神振作樂心的時候，她又遲延了，這時候的你，還不是她的圈中物麽？這時她勝利了！她以不及不離的態度來斷定你的意識，倒可眞算得是行的鐵腕政策！國際間何嘗不是這樣？不即不離的。不過太　都　些。</p>
<p>『做人』要是學到了這個方策就好咧丨逢到了剛挺的上司，簡直是不可理諭，那你就可依此法而例之，百般地奉承，低首下氣，比做兒子還孝敬十培，等他對你略爲示點好感的時候，你就可有所需求了，至少發話的資格是有的了，這時你要是狠心的話，不，聰明的話，你就可進讒那個一下子，或者你竟有候補的機會，若是例外地成了他的心服，那就更好咧！</p>
<p>這還是個『　　』方策，還有一個『應時』方策，也是很重要的，再拏女人來說丨丨一個伶俐的女人，透澈的女人，她感到肉的缺乏，所以不惜地犧牲着把來給不衆賞覽，她還塗着美麗的脂粉，一切人工的美，這樣，還怕人家不向她行注目禮嗎？夠啦，祇要有人向她行注目禮，她就有所施展了！有了發展還怕什麽？</p>
<p>『做人』也是這樣，做得特别，做得透切，看凖了那裏有孔，就　命往前營　，『　』　　就　點小　也　　　　如說：那個長官姨太太死咧，假如你有美麗的妻子，妹子，或者就有點小親也可，你就得趕快把她呈了上去，要快，因爲候補的人多咧！不然的說，就被捷足者先得去了！這樣做，怕也會受人譏笑，但是不妨的，他何嘗不想這樣，不過缺點『做人』的門徑罷了！</p>
<p>你能夠做了人，人匕人，向你行注目禮的也多了，人家注目了你，你也　女人一般的有了發展，有了發展，來　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　。</p>

<h3>黑路的摸索者</h3>
<p>— 蓉子</p>
<p>事實上不得不呌我承認：我是過了二十幾年摸黑路的生活丨丨一直到現在，我的面前，仍然是漆黑的一團糟。雖然這般我的打擊，是深刻得只有呌我捺掉了野心，忘記了夢想，而咒詛人生，懷疑人生，甚至想要逃避人生！但其間，偶然也像死灰復燃似的，我曾屢次鼓了最後的勇氣，掙扎着想去尋求光明，有時甚至於慌張得拚命的在滿山滿林裏亂碰亂趕，然而頭皮碰腫了，終於是兜不出這銅墻鐵壁般的黑暗的圈子與死的雾圍！我想：是命運註定了該做奴隸受鞭苔一生而悄然至於死的嗎？</p>
<p>姑媽從南京來，說起幾年來和我同遭一個命運的世杰，因不堪環境的鞭苔宰割之苦與一切深陷於無辦法之中到燕子磯頭自殺在滾滾的洪流之中了！</p>
<p>世杰，一提起這個熟悉的名字，便有一個面孔剛毅深沉，個子結實高大的影子浮在我的意識上了。在這個影子的臉上，劃着兩道濃闊的眉毛，和要多條飽任了風霜與折磨而描成的曲線的皺紋，還有厚的唇，扁的鼻，削長的臉，深刻的眸子…………這些，都一樣一樣的重現在我的眼前了，尤其是他那股勤勞，忠實和果敬的勁兒，是存留在我的心頭而永遠不能磨滅消逝的了。兩年以來，他從破了産的鄉下帶着饑餓的肚子跑到上海來找飯吃丨丨這不是做夢嗎？上海豈是窮孩子的上海，而况他又是一個不會滑頭隂險，投機作僞的鄉下人呢？但是，整整一年的流浪生活，雖然把他的肚腸餓的更乾癟得不得樣子了，他的求生的意志和勇氣可倒加强了。於是他毅然懷了極大的野心離開了上海到廣東，但不幸的事，總是這樣來得意外的，那時那邊的ＸＸＸ和ＸＸＸ正在火併，一切情形都是亂麻般的，他一點眉目没有的奔走期待了三個月，就廢然重返上海。自此以後的生活，他就像一匹失了繮的野馬了，没有目的，没有决心的回鄉下去，第二次到廣東，到湖南，回上海，又往江西，最後才流到了我們的首都，南京。他是一無所成的在黑路上空趕了兩個年頭，終於在洪流中埋葬了他疲憊的身子。啊，世杰，一個黑路上的慘死者哪！</p>
<p>起初，我是懷疑的：不會滑頭隂險，投機作僞的人，都是應當在黑路上摸索一輩子，而終至於慘死的嗎？事實的答覆，固然是這樣；但由世杰的慘死而給我的啓示，不特呌我把以往的唐頽捺到九霄雲外，把已經消失的求生的意志和勇氣重新抓了回來，並且我明白在這年頭兒，在這人吃人的社會制度之下，像世杰和我之類的人之被趕上黑路，這是必然的反映，惟世杰之最後的處决，太表現他是個没出息的弱者了；無辦法固然痛苦，但固無辦法便去糊裏糊塗的死了，則未免不是愚笨！因爲死了便算走通了黑路，摸到了光明嗎？這當然是不能的。我們應當首先找出無辦法的原因，給它一個條理的分析，最後，明白自己身上所負的救人救己的大責任，不斷的毅然刻苦的向前幹着。那麽，在這條漫長昏暗的黑路上，才會由黑路的摸索者用自身的能和力建造起一架堅固的高大的永遠照得整個世界通明的燈塔來！</p>
<p>「是命運註定了該做奴隸受鞭苔一生而悄然至於死的嗎？」我的朋友們，黑路的摸索者喲，這是欺騙人的！我們踏在荆棘上，只要當心脚下的坑；牽起手來，我們應當切實地自救救人！</p>
<h3>香烟與愛人</h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>自己不幸和香烟做了朋友，没時没刻離得了牠。工作疲倦時牠能使我的精神興奮。雖然在高級小學念書時已經知道烟中含着可怕的尼古丁，能夠危害身體的康健，可是我總不能和牠割席絕交。</p>
<p>香烟是我底朋友，然而香烟却是我底愛人的仇敵。她曾經在信中命令我立刻和烟捲絕交，她誥誡我說烟對我是没好處的，她並且說：『…假如你不照我的話辦，那我永遠和你絕交。』</p>
<p>我處拉極爲難的境界中。在接到她那封信的晚上，我思慮了一夜之久。矛盾的思想在我底腦中作戰。</p>
<p>根據了亞聖孟老夫子的話；『烟，我所欲也；愛人，亦我所欲也，二者不可得兼……』底下我就没法决定。我遠是舍愛人而取烟捲呢，還是該舍烟捲而取愛人？</p>
<p>終拉，我决定了舍了烟捲。我忍痛地和相交四五年之久的烟捲絕交了。</p>
<p>在開始絕交之後，我有說不出的難過。胸中悶得很，尤其在飯後和大便的時候。工作時也不能像以前一樣的興奮迅速。更可怕的是父親吸烟時對我的誘惑。我常常站在他的旁邊，當他吸烟的時候，我狂吸着從他口中噴出來的青烟。我幾次三番地把烟夾在唇間，可是總爲了怕有頁拉愛人的殷生而哄着氣把烟從口唇間拿下來。自從與牠絕交之後，我好像墜入痛苦的國土裏一般。</p>
<p>我敵不過牠的誘惑，我受不了這樣的痛苦，終拉我做了一個意志薄弱的傢伙，向烟捲深表歉意，和牠復交了。這並不是羞恥的事，一個國家可以和别的國家絕交，也可以復交。何况我！</p>
<p>可是愛人却從此就不理我了。她以爲我是一個無賴。没有烟，我痛苦：没愛人，我孤獨。我就被這兩樣東西支配着了！去了痛苦來了孤獨，去了孤獨來了痛苦！我還是受着肉體的痛苦呢，還是受着精神上的孤獨？</p>
<p>至少，我可以得到其中的一個。</p>

<h3>戰爭與和平（五一）（四幕劇）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>第三幕　和平禮讚</p>
<p>老者：不過，周三爺，他家裏也實在是窮。加之又打仗打得這個樣子，你敎他拿什麽來還錢糧呢？還是請三爺在縣長面前說幾句好話，再欠住幾個月，到收下忙的時候一道還吧。</p>
<p>村長：那不成，錢糧國課，那好欠的呢？至於我的十三塊錢，我知道他是窮光蛋，就再等他一個月也没有什麽。不過就是賣了妹子也要還給我的。</p>
<p>中年婦人：還是請三爺開恩罷（跪下），饒了我這條老命。……給這次仗一打，我們家裏確是窮得没有飯吃。以後就是變牛變馬也要還給你三爺。</p>
<p>村長：現在是收皇糧國課，這是没有情面可講的。你得知道，政府爲了打仗的事，已是很要錢用，現在又是和平開始，實行建設救國，更是要錢用。政府又不能做賊打搶，假使你們不完糧，拿什麽來談建設，拿什麽來買飛機航空救國呀？至於我的那筆欵子，連本帶利要……三分息算，三得三，三三九，這個月就得十七塊，你拿什麽還？不過到下一個月就得十七元半了。……本來，假使你的大和尚是一個安分守己的人，這一次錢糧，我未常不可以代你墊出來，可是他平素太愛逞强，勾結敵軍，甘心做漢奸，你們想，這還是有良心的人嗎？</p>
<p>青年乙：不過我們知道大和尚並不是漢奸。</p>
<p>村長：什麽？你們知道，呸！難道我還不知道嗎？</p>
<p>保安隊甲：不管怎麽的，我們先把這老太婆和小姑娘帶去。</p>
<p>少女：媽丨我們不去。</p>
<p>中年婦人：三爺求求你！</p>
<p>村長：不成，我管不了這些，你將你的兒子交出來。</p>
<p>老者：天哪，你敎她怎麽交出來？他躱着不見，又有什麽辦法呢？眞是太不講道理了。</p>
<p>村長：什麽？你說誰不講道理？</p>
<p>保安隊乙：那末將這老傢伙也帶去。</p>
<p>老者：去就去，我又没有犯王法，我還怕嗎？反正我這麽老了，要殺就殺罷！……</p>
<p>（另一中年婦人抱着一嬰孩，又牽着一小孩自人羣中擠上。）</p>
<p>村長：噢？你還敢倔强，帶他去！</p>
<p>中年婦人乙：什麽？什麽？爸爸爲什麽要帶你去呀！</p>
<p>老者：哦！你們來了。……啊！眞是昏天黑地的世界，我不過說了一句公道話，便連我也要捉去。</p>
<p>小孩：（即第一幕上塲的）爺爺，你不去，你不要去！</p>
<p>中年婦人乙：那不成，那不成，你去了，丢下我們幾個小孩兒怎麽辦呀！</p>
<p>老者：哦！是的，我怎麽能去，這兩位小孫兒怎麽辦呢？（抱起小孩兒）他的爸爸給大兵挑擔去了，直到現在還没有回來，我怎麽能去呢？哦！我不能去，我不能去，我不是活活的要餓死他們麽？</p>
<p>保安隊乙：（拉着他。）不管這麽些，去！（小孩兒嚇得哭起來）。</p>

<h3>關於大電影院的管理（上）　倫敦某影院經理之經騐談</h3>
<p>— 深翁</p>
<p>一座電影院的營業如何，以及觀衆所得的享受能夠滿意與否，和一個電影院的經理，是極有關係的。克魯爾Ｈ.Ｗ.Ｃrull，他是倫敦帝國戲院的經理，這是倫敦西區幾家最華麗影院中的一家。最近他在一部英國出版的電影刋物上，發表了一篇關於管理影院的文字。鄙人現在將它迻譯出來，寫在下面：好使得讀報諸君，知道管理一座戲院，確是一種很有趣味而又非常麻煩的工作。</p>
<p>這電影院的經理，在大多數觀衆看起來，他不過是這麽一個人，穿着整潔的衣服，站在穿堂裏，有時向着那顯貴的觀衆，鞠躬致敬：有時揮動他的手臂，去指揮招待人員工作。看上去打扮得是很漂亮的，但是他究竟有些什麽工作呢？簡括說一句，他就是用來服侍觀衆，使得觀衆們個個得着舒適和滿意的。在我的戲院裏，每星期的觀衆，自五萬人至十萬人，所以我就負着使得這麽許多顧客滿意的責任。我的工作時間，和許多大戲院經理一樣，普通每天有十四個鐘頭。</p>
<p>讓我先來把一個大影戲院經理的日常工作，告訴你們。他在上午九句鐘到了戲院，要在第一塲戲以前，把全院偵察一下。他得去視察那各處的電燈有無損壞。他得去審查坐位，地毯和牆壁上面有没有怠惰工作的記號。這是清潔隊從半夜到天明五點鐘的時候來打掃的。等到十點鐘快到時，他還要到外面去督察第一場（即早場）開塲，開映後，他又要去注意發音和光綫怎樣。如果有一點兒不合式，他就得開照放映間糾正。等到一切都上了正軌了，他才向觀衆最後注視一下，然後回到他的辦公室去。</p>
<p>那裏已經有很多的郵件等着他了。一位大影院的經理，一星期接到主顧的信，總有好幾百件。第一個貢獻一個新的曲調，給那琴師在休息時候彈奏。第二個說是他落掉一副手套在戲院裏。第三個怪一個男子，在她的隔座大吸其雪笳。總之有許多信是包括很好的忠告的，經理當然十分歡迎。等他讀了這許多信，可是又有很多的事情跟着來了。一直要等到午膳的時候，他才能夠把寫回信和日常公事支配完畢。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>「飄零」評</h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>「飄零」是天一公司接續「飛絮」的一張片子。因爲「飛絮」，給人們印象尚佳，所以在看「飄零」時，是存着相當的希望的。特别是湯小丹君的導演，我們很有認識一下的必要。</p>
<p>飄零的故事，是說「飛絮中的秀貞，因爲丈夫的病死，及其翁的撤了地保的差事，遭婆婆痛駡爲害人精，更因財主胡福保要拿她作妾，所以私自逃往都市爲傭，但主人又挑以游辭，因而和同伴柳青進廠做女工。後遇少年丁振平，一見傾心，遂賦同居，但丁因此而爲學校開除，且被禁於家庭。秀貞受房東摧索租金，無以應，遂於風雨之夜，帶病出走。幸柳青扶歸陋室，待丁趕至，她只吐出最後的哀音而逝世。」因爲故事簡單，「飄零」的本事，（說明書）是採取詩的形式的，最後并且有以下的句子，「飛絮，飄零！她的遭遇，爲甚這樣慘酷，歸納起來，是萬惡社會造成！</p>
<p>本來在「飛絮」中，是相當的展開了中國農邨的眞實。就是飄零中開始時，秀貞的丈夫病死，翁又撤差，因而遭到婆婆的毒駡，在中國的封建殘餘勢力濃厚的農邨　，所謂一尅夫星，」所謂「敗家精，」是非常普遍在人們口頭流行。中國婦女，在這一個荒謬的迷信中，犧牲了多少生命，造成了多少悲苦的命運，作者抓緊這一點，確是狠相當的。但是可惜，這一節故事，只用字幕一提，畫面上一點也看不到。而對於成了中國電影題材公式的土豪逼婚，倒詳細的寫，這是作者的剏作方法决定的！一點也不能勉强！</p>
<p>就是後邊秀貞和柳青去做工，他一點也不提工人的痛苦，和廠方的壓迫，而莫名其妙的把秀貞寫得碰到丁振平而同居。假使不是學校開除，家庭禁止，秀貞就成了柳貞口中的丁太太了。試問做「丁太太」，是不是秀貞的出路？更是不是全體女工的出路呢？作者因爲偏于插出丁家的封建的親威，偏於暴露封建殘餘，而把其他更重要的忽略了！這是故事和導演方面的大缺憾！</p>
<p>至於導演方面的小缺點：</p>
<p>第一，傅老爺給秀貞戒指，太隨便，傅老爺好像早已準備着把戒指放在身上，而前此又没有表現過。</p>
<p>第二，秀貞旣在傅家帮傭，怎麽薦頭店高家一呌，她立刻就走，連主人面前也不回一句？這是不合理的，特别她是傅老爺有心於她的女傭。</p>
<p>第三，丁振平寫給秀貞信，給他的父親看到，但這信對於故事是很少關係的。而秀貞寫給丁振平的信，我們旣然没有看到秀貞寫，也没有看到她寄，更没有看到寄到丁家，被丁振平的父親没收，只在字幕裏說及，是不夠的。</p>
<p>第四，丁振平的父親，關照僕役不准丁振平出外，和没收他的信！果然僕役把丁寫給秀貞的信，呈給他，但最後丁振平去看秀貞，是乘汽車去的，何以他關照僕役不要告訴老爺，僕役就不告訴呢？</p>
<p>第五，秀貞幾次等公共汽車，路上的行人太少，甚至没有一個，也是不對的。</p>
<p>此外，導演者於秀貞做工的時候，她在家裏種一枝花，日日灌溉，特别在和丁相遇那天，更灌溉得起勁，後來在風雨之夜，秀貞臨死之前，花被風雨摧折，這種「兼象徽」的方法，是可取的，但一個女工，是不見得有種花的閑情吧？</p>
<p>至於表演，胡珊代替「飛絮」中袁美雲的角色，而遠不及袁美雲，馬陋芬太不夠，其他也没有好的地方！</p>
<p>總之，在飛絮中，天一公司的用了買關子的方式，呌人們在「飄零」中看結果，現在在飄零中我們看到的結果是「幻滅」。這「幻滅」并不是偶然的，因爲没有認清必然的前途！所以秀貞的認不清前途，當然是製作者認不清前途。</p>
<h3>評「馬塲秘史」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ｔhe　Calendar</p>
<p>看了這一作品之後，我想一定有人說：「這是非常沉悶的」。的確，這是主要的缺點。</p>
<p>一般的說，沉默的演出，不一定都是不好的方法，假使在劇中能夠很好的注意到内心的表演，假使在整個的劇中能夠把握住靜的情調。喬其亞立斯的「博愛」是如此，安哈婷的「流水年華」也是如此。在這些影片中，我們不必看到無謂的噱頭，或是激烈的打武，反之，我們正給那種靜的力攫住了心胸，無一個場面都使我們融洽了劇中人的情感。因此，我們並没有沈悶的感覺。</p>
<p>然而這裏的沉默的演出却是失敗了。勿論他有着發鬆的對白，勿論它有着可笑的動作。只就這一點，便證明導演能力的不夠。他盡力的要使劇情趣味化，然而所得的效果却正相反。</p>
<p>不過這主要的還是故事的平庸，在這樣庸俗的故事之下，自然得不着好的結果。即使導演極巧妙的换過某種方法演出，此不見得能使人有着了不起的吟味。何况這裏就根本没有插入一些跳舞或是肉感的可能，儘可能的祗是少許勉强刺激的場合。否則，和一般的美國片一樣，未嘗不可以利用大腿酥胸大大的賣弄一下。當然，我們並非說因爲不夠肉感而失望，反之，却是說作者正没有方法來一套瘋狂的拿手好戲。</p>
<p>至於故事中說些什麽，我想，凡是和歐美片多有接觸的人們，一定可以想像得出，還不是那些男才女貌，一見傾心的巴戲。然而好事多磨，未免醋海興波，結果，一定是有情人到底有着圓滿的結果。不管這裏是馬場少年愛上大公爵的小姐，不管一個平民和小姐有着尊卑之分，不管他們之間的經濟是何等的懸殊，到後來終於化除了這些阻礙，反正他們可把戀愛至上主義做最好的解釋。其實，戀愛决不是超越一切的東西，無論如何，經濟的力量早已决定了各樣人們的戀愛，祗有没落的藝術，才自欺欺人，堅持着戀愛至高無上的論調。自然這不是毫無用意的，但在此不必詳述。</p>
<p>至於演員方面，那一個公爵倒是相當出色的，至少他還没放鬆劇中人的身份。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>所謂「古寺鵑聲」</h3>
<p>— 寅仲</p>
<p>當革命的潮流，澎漲到頂峯的時候，隨着就起了一陣反動。同樣，當電影界轉變了方向，正在繼續邁步前進之際，隨之亦發生了開倒車的行徑。而電影界的這種行徑，就是從轉變者自身表現出來的。這眞是可惋惜的事！</p>
<p>聯華公司，不是我國影業中之最前進的嗎？而它的開個車行爲，也要算最出色的；不信，請看現正開映在「北京」的「古寺鵑聲」！</p>
<p>我們看了這張片子，好像看了「太上感應篇」一樣。全片的故事，澈頭澈尾是一種所謂「善有善報，惡有惡報」的「因果錄」，無疑地，是在替「鬼神」說敎，是在提倡迷信思想！其實，我國民衆的腦子　的迷信毒素已夠利害了，何苦還要去助長它。</p>
<p>可是這張片子，居然還能吸引得住一些觀衆，這也無疑地，因爲還有需要它的在，這就是平日一班自命所謂「善男信女們。他們正可以把這張片子去作宣傳「果報」的良好工具。而影片公司當局，要不是也因爲看透了這一點，它還肯耗費心力去製造它出來嗎？</p>

<h3>電影小說桃李芬芳　Ｐaddy　the　Next　Best　Thing（一）　美國福斯公司出品丨丨珍　坭蓋諾華納巴克斯德主演</h3>
<p>— 幸生</p>
<p>愛爾蘭的一處海邊上風景的清幽，眞是無以復加，海色一線連天，忽然遠處來了一艘遊艇，掛了帆駛進了海口。那遊艇下了錨，就有兩個人從船上爬了下來，跨進了一隻小舢板，朝着岸潑浪而來。這兩個人在舢板裏談着話。裏面的一個呌薛雷伯，他似乎是一位落落寡歡的人。他怪着他的同伴，他說：「你倘使因爲無事可作，而必須藉婚姻作消遣的話，那還有可說；但是你，放棄了你自己的事業，老遠的從錫蘭跑到這裏來向一個多年没有見面的女子求婚，我眞有些莫名其妙了。」那一個人呌勃萊克，外貌是很羅曼的克的，他說：「我現在是己經浸濕在戀愛之中了：但是，我還没有向她求婚呀。」薛雷伯道：「那你儘管放心好了，這事是差不多十足成功的了。」</p>
<p>他們忽然看見遠處有一隻小船翻身了，上面好像有一個女人似的。他們就掉轉船頭，向着那隻翻身的船划過去。等到走近了一看，却是有些作怪；那個女郎的船雖翻了，她却一隻手攀着船舷，一隻手拿着一隻蘋果在那裏啃。勃萊克走近了問道：「喂，你在那裏作什麽？她說：「我船翻了，早餐都没有了，祗剩了這只蘋果。」他們就把她把上了舢板。靠了岸，她就跳躍的去了。</p>
<p>那女郎去後，勃萊克問那旁邊的漁人道：「這女郎是誰？是不是在這裏住的？」那些漁人道：那就是潘弟，亞代爾小姐，是住在這裏的。」勃萊克驚呼道：「她難道是愛琳，亞代爾小姐的妹子嗎？那些漁人都說：「是的，一些也不差。」勃萊克回過頭來看萊薛雷伯道：「大概這位我們救起來的，還是我的小姨呢。」於是他們先去打電話給亞代爾大尉去了。</p>
<p>勃萊克的電話再巧没有了。他打電話的時候，正是大尉爲難的時候，他被（大隊的債主團困着。他們亂哄哄地鬧着：「要是再没有法子想的話，那我們一個月之内，祇好採取强　的方法了。」亞代爾大尉去接電話去了。他接了電話回來，興匆匆地向那些債主道：「好了，好了，你們放心吧。我女兒的未婚夫，剛才來電話。我女兒的未婚夫，就是勞倫斯勃萊克。等我女兒嫁了勃萊克之後，我决不欠你們半個大錢。好了，再見吧。」他鞠着躬，拿許多債主都哄走了。</p>
<p>「或者這婚姻的買賣，有些指望，」一個債主說。「别聽那老東西的話。他專門驅人。從前他講他奥斯塔拉文尼亞的伯父死了，有遺産傳給他。誰知道地球上亦没有奥斯塔拉文尼亞一個地方；他亦没有伯父，他祇有一個姑母！（未完）</p>

There are about a hundred soldiers moving around on the mountain, observing very clearly. There are about 4,000 bandits inside the city. It seems Guo Ya is still inside directing them. Only Rong Shan's unit has fled to Taitouying and other places, making contact with Zhou's troops. Zhou's unit is advancing along the Tianzhuang line, but is still far from the city. Dou's unit is advancing very quickly, taking an arc-shaped formation and encircling Fucheng. Gunfire has been dense since last night until this morning. There have been minor clashes in all units. It only subsided slightly at dawn. At noon on the 22nd, a plane flew around Fucheng for reconnaissance for about ten minutes before leaving. Zhang Xiaoguang arrived in Changli in the afternoon to inspect the defenses. After finishing, he returned to Qin. It is heard that the authorities have decided to be lenient towards the bandits and to both suppress and appease them.

<p>The Ningxia Provincial Committee Resigns En Masse</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying Expresses Only the Desire to Maintain the Livelihood of His Troops; Authorities Devise Two Solutions Regarding the Garrison Location of Sun's Army</h3>
<p>(Beiping) - As Sun Dianying's army moves west, Ningxia Chairman Ma Hongkui refused him passage on the order of Zhu Shaoliang and telegraphed the central government to resign. Now the entire committee of the Ningxia Provincial Government has issued a telegram of resignation due to this matter. The original telegram roughly stated: "Recently, it has been heard that Army Commander Sun Dianying is stationed in Qingxi, levying supplies, and is about to reach the border. Due to the rumors spread, merchants and residents in the areas of Dengkou, Shizuishan, and Pingluo are moving and fleeing, exposed to the elements, and buried by wind and snow, with many deaths. Various counties have successively requested instructions on how to respond. Upon investigation, Army Commander Sun is coming west with the clear order of the central government, but the central government has not indicated how the route should be taken through the military area, or whether military food should be supplied. The local area is extremely poor. If Sun's army levies supplies, it will inevitably lead to conflict. If the Ningxia province prepares to supply them, it will be exhausted. In this extremely difficult situation, there is no perfect solution. The committee members feel that they are lacking in wisdom and talent and are unable to cope. They are unable to comfort the local people and unable to face the central government. They are ashamed of their positions and should quickly yield to the worthy. Therefore, they dare to express the situation and jointly request the government to understand their humble intentions and allow them to resign from their respective positions immediately, and quickly appoint someone to take over, so as to avoid guilt and thank the people." (Special Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) - Regarding the matter of Sun Dianying's troops moving west, Sun has expressed to the central government and all parties that as long as the livelihood of his troops can be maintained, whether or not to move is not a problem. His future actions will be subject to the orders of the central government. It is heard that the authorities have devised two solutions: one is to follow Wang's proposal to transfer Sun's troops to Xinjiang to strengthen border defense, but this issue is quite complex and requires the consent of all parties. The other is to have Sun's troops stationed in the Suiyuan-Baotou area, and then the central government will issue instructions to determine their future actions. This solution is being discussed with the Shanxi-Suiyuan authorities. In general, it must be resolved peacefully and no other misunderstandings should arise as a result. It is expected to be decided in the near future. (Special Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) - Wang Shiping, the director of the 41st Army stationed in Beiping, visited He Yingqin yesterday to inquire about the measures regarding Sun's army moving west. If they cannot move out, please have He issue an order to temporarily station them in the Baotou, Wuyuan, and Linhe areas. He has telegraphed the central government for instructions and will reply after the reply telegram arrives in Beiping. (Special Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

Tao's intention to resign may be dispelled. (Special Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Letter to Bandit Army Officers and Soldiers; Instructing Three Ways to Escape and Save Their Lives</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) - The bandits encircled in the massive suppression are already exhausted. In order to relieve the suffering of the Jiangxi people as soon as possible, Chairman Chiang declared that all officers and soldiers of the bandit forces who surrender will not only not be held accountable for the past, but will also be guaranteed and treated favorably. Now Chiang is issuing a letter to the officers and soldiers of the bandit army, instructing three ways to escape and save their lives: (1) When the bandit leaders force you to attack our National Army, just pretend to rush forward, quickly put down your guns, and run to our front line to surrender; (2) When the bandit leaders want you to retreat, pretend to be sick and fall behind, hide in the deep forest, and when our National Army chases after you, quickly get up and surrender; (3) When you fall behind, you may be afraid that the bandits will turn back to find you, so as soon as the bandit army retreats, fire a cold shot in the place where you fell behind, so that the bandit leaders will be afraid and not turn back to look for you, and you can safely surrender.

<h3>US-Soviet Diplomatic Relations Take a Sharp Turn for the Better; White House Prepares to Welcome Soviet Representatives; So They Will Have the Pleasure of Feeling at Home; Preliminary Negotiations Divided into Two Steps; Guarantees Obtained on Debt Issues; Further Consultations on Trade Agreements</h3>
<p>(Washington) - US Secretary of State Hull stated today that the State Department is working to prepare for talks between the President and the Soviet representatives. Although there will be no formal welcoming ceremony for Litvinov, he will be sincerely welcomed and everything possible will be done to make Mr. Litvinov feel at home. (National Telegram from the 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) - Today, the US State Department stated that the US government's decision to discuss the possibility of restoring relations with the Soviet Union does not presuppose recognition of the Soviet Union. At the same time, it requested all commercial firms with debt claims against Russia to report to the State Department in detail, stating that these debt claims are of great importance to the restoration of relations. It is heard that the State Department is particularly concerned about the confiscated property of the Singer Sewing Machine Company and the New York Life Insurance Company, and the unpaid principal and interest on debts incurred during the Tsarist era.</p>
<p>It was stated today that if the preliminary discussions between the US President and Litvinov can clear away obstacles, they can proceed to negotiate a trade agreement. However, the debt claims of US businessmen must be considered first before the details of the trade agreement can be substantively discussed. (National Telegram from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Greatly Excited; Hopes to Achieve a Triple Result</h3>
<p>(Moscow) - All of Soviet Russia is greatly excited by the news that the United States will recognize it. Soviet leaders stated today that Russia hopes that the restoration of US-Soviet relations will have a triple result: (1) A large increase in the convenience of borrowing; (2) The removal of US obstacles to some Russian goods; (3) The consolidation of Soviet Russia's position in the Far East vis-à-vis Japan. It is Soviet Russia's conviction that world economic conditions have created a negotiating position with the United States. If the United States is willing to trade, Soviet Russia will inquire about the conditions for restoring large-scale trade, which are nothing more than agreeing to full credit so that Soviet Russia can purchase from the United States and remove US restrictions on Russian goods. (Reuters from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japan Spiritually Affected; Military Authorities Put on a Show of Calm</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) - The issue of the United States recognizing the Soviet Union is about to enter a concrete stage. Army Minister Araki's observations on this matter are as follows: "It is impossible to predict whether the United States recognizing the Soviet Union will become a reality. However, Japan should treat this case with a calm and composed attitude, and there is no need to look left or right." Also, the observations of the Japanese military authorities are roughly as follows: "The truth about the United States recognizing the Soviet Union is not yet clear, so it is difficult to criticize the views. If the United States wants to make Soviet Russia recognize its war debts from the Kerensky era and urge it to repay them, and if Soviet Russia acknowledges them, then Japan also has several hundred million in war debts. The issue of purchasing the Eastern Railway could be easily resolved by this. But it is feared that Soviet Russia will not easily acknowledge them. If the United States abandons Soviet Russia's war debts, then the European countries' war debts should also follow suit. In this regard, recognition is even more difficult to implement. Moreover, discharged soldiers and their groups in the United States have expressed stubborn opposition, making it even more difficult for this case to pass through Congress. But the United States is in an unprecedented state of panic, and its desire to expand its trade market is very urgent, so it is inevitable that it will promote the recognition of Soviet Russia. However, the timing of recognition is not so pressing as to be decided immediately. There are also traces of attempts to check Japan. Even if it is realized, the recognition strategy, then the fact that it has not been recognized until today would be an inconceivable situation. Japan will only be slightly spiritually affected by it. As for saying that Japan will be deeply affected by this, it is only the speculation of those with shallow views." (United Press from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Prospects for Restoration of Relations Optimistic; Can Greatly Increase Trade Between the Two Countries; Congressional Approval Undoubtedly Possible</h3>
<p>(Washington) - The Soviet representative is eager to come to the White House, and officials here are also hoping to quickly recognize Soviet Russia so as to increase Russian-American trade. According to reliable non-official sources, Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov may meet with President Roosevelt within two weeks. President Roosevelt's talk to reporters about the Russian letter has begun to prepare for the "abnormal situation" between the two countries mentioned in the letter, which has aroused optimism here. Officials expressed their personal opinion that if the talks can resolve the difficulties in recognizing the Soviet Union, business should have an initiation of over one hundred million yuan. Farm Credit Administration Director Morgenthau is now hopeful of being sent to Russia. When Congress convenes in the future, there may be opposition to President Roosevelt's recognition of Russia. The American Federation of Labor has now expressed its opposition, but if the President submits the list of candidates to be sent to Russia to Congress for approval, the Senate may not have enough power to strike it down.

<h3>Using Diplomacy, the US and Russia Vie with Each Other; The Exchange of Letters and Telegrams Actually Occurred on October 19th; The Date was Intentionally Backdated to Avoid Unfavorable Impressions</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Today it was learned that the letter from US President Roosevelt to the Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, Kalinin, was sent by telegram. However, the actual date of dispatch was nine days later than the announced date of the letter. This discovery could add a new dimension to future resumption of diplomatic relations talks in Washington. According to the US President's letter simultaneously announced yesterday in Moscow and Washington, it was stated to have been sent from Washington on October 10th. However, according to unofficial but extremely reliable sources, it was actually telegraphed directly to Kalinin on October 19th. As for the reason why the US President backdated the letter, it is said here that it was to avoid the external impression that this matter arose due to the tense relations between Japan and Russia. (Note: October 19th was just after the Japanese Five Ministers' Conference was about to end, and the situation of the victory of the pro-war faction had been determined.) Referring to the comments of various countries on this matter, one can also see the amazing and transformative use of diplomatic tactics in international struggles. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Wall Street Revitalized; Capitalists Willing to Help Develop Trade</h3>
<p>(Washington) At present, the entire United States seems to be largely in favor of the US President and Soviet representatives studying the issue of full resumption of diplomatic relations. Wall Street agrees with the government's views, and most bankers believe that if the President deems the Soviet Union's guarantees acceptable, recognition can be granted. Several prominent bankers have also stated that although the current securities market cannot absorb large amounts of Russian debt or bonds issued based on Soviet trade, many capitalists are quite willing to provide private loans in exchange for concessions in trade or industry. It is expected that once recognition is granted, the Soviet Union will continue to raise funds in the United States to purchase goods. Several officials who have been in contact with Soviet trade representatives have stated that if suitable credit terms are available, the Soviet Union will be prepared to purchase 500 million yuan worth of goods in the United States. News from Moscow also seems to corroborate this statement. It is anticipated that Litvinov will also mention this matter when discussing the outline of a trade agreement with the US President. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<h3>The First Russian Ambassador to the United States; Metzlerov Expected</h3>
<p>(Washington) At this time, the one who most welcomes the progress of the resumption of diplomatic relations issue is probably former Senator Brockhart. Brockhart currently serves as an advisor to the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, specializing in special campaigns to promote the sale of agricultural products, especially cotton, abroad. The next is Senator Coulson. Coulson was the first to make private contact with Soviet representative Metzlerov while attending a conference in London. He stated today that if the President reaches a satisfactory agreement with the Russian representatives, he would support the recognition of the Russian government. Metzlerov is currently the Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Committee. According to news from Moscow today, the Russian authorities have internally decided that once diplomatic relations are restored, Metzlerov will be the first ambassador to the United States. If Metzlerov is unable to go to the United States, then the current Deputy Commissar of Foreign Affairs, Sokolnikov, may be appointed instead. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Advocates for Equalizing National Wealth</h3>
<p>(Washington) After receiving an honorary degree from Washington College today, President Roosevelt delivered a speech calling on the people to show the spirit of cooperation from the colonial era. He also stated that several countries now have dictators who have formulated their so-called five-year or ten-year plans, but the United States does not have a dictator. He believes that "we can further advance to our goals without limiting a certain period." He also said that distributing the wealth of a few people to the people at large would almost lead the country to safety. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Various Countries' Opinions on the US and Russia Resuming Diplomatic Relations</p>
<h3>US Newspapers Claim It's for Domestic Purposes</h3>
<p>(London) Various countries' opinions indicate that President Roosevelt's proposal to Russia is a victory. However, some Washington dispatches from New York newspapers indicate that this is a trick to shift the public's attention from the current rural uproar to the Soviet Union. The Paris Echo reported an article by Pedina, stating that the Soviet Union is gradually abandoning its plan for world revolution and wants to work peacefully in middle-class countries. The United States has slightly damaged its pride in dealing with the current crisis. The increasing power of Japan is one of the reasons for the US and Russia to get closer. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan's Ambition Helped Facilitate It</h3>
<p>(London) The press believes that the rapprochement between the United States and the Soviet Union is due to the unstable situation in the Far East. It is generally believed that 1935 is a critical juncture for Japan because Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations will take effect in that year. (Member states that withdraw must fulfill all obligations for two years from the date of notification.) When that time comes, the issue of the islands in the Pacific mandated to Japan will be clearly raised for discussion. The Sunday Times stated, "A naval conference may be held again in 1935, and Japan has decided to make a request to expand its navy." It also stated that by 1935, the Soviet Union's second five-year plan will be completed, and the domestic situation will inevitably be eased. "We should not ignore the warnings from Manchuria. Although we cannot worry about the current changes in the situation because of this, the arrival of unexpected events should not be ignored. The reason why the United States and the Soviet Union have mutual interests in restoring diplomatic relations is becoming increasingly clear from the above facts." (22nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Containing Japan to Some Extent</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German Volkszeitung stated today that if the United States recognizes the Soviet Union, this move will undoubtedly contain Japan to some extent. However, the restoration of diplomatic relations between these two major powers outside the League of Nations will tend to guarantee and maintain world peace. Since Germany has also withdrawn from the League of Nations, it should express special sympathy to the United States. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union's Status is No Longer Isolated</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official "Foreign Political Correspondence" regards the exchange of letters and telegrams between US President Roosevelt and the Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, Kalinin, as the most important event in the current international arena. The newspaper first stated that the recognition of Soviet Russia was initiated by the United States, and then said, "The United States' recognition of Soviet Russia shows that the US government recognizes that the current Soviet political system is sufficient to represent Russia." The newspaper also stated that the era of Soviet isolation has now completely ended. Germany can only be pleased with this change because Germany has always believed that a country as large as Russia would never be excluded from the Western groups. It also believes that when Russia fully restores its original position in international relations, all kinds of political and economic problems in the future will naturally return to normal. (21st Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>No Less Than a Warning to Japan</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French press is paying close attention to the growing closeness between the United States and the Soviet Union. "Le Temps" commented on this matter in a special article, saying that the Soviet Foreign Minister will go to the United States in the near future, and his talks with Roosevelt will be very interesting. The newspaper said, "Roosevelt's plan to resume diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union is no less than a warning to Japan. Roosevelt is well aware of Germany's intentions towards the Soviet Union, so this move is also a warning to Germany." However, "Le Temps" and "Qingyi Bao" still expressed some reservations. "Le Temps" is deeply concerned that the Soviet Union will promote revolution and communism in the United States, while "Qingyi Bao" said that the US President's plan is no less than consolidating Soviet politics. The Radical Party newspapers stated that the Soviet Union is determined to implement a policy of coordination and peace, and the conclusion of non-aggression treaties with its neighboring countries and France is the beginning of implementing this policy. It is fortunate that the Soviet Union's aspirations are becoming increasingly firm. (21st Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Exchange of Letters and Telegrams is Equivalent to Recognition</h3>
<p>Rome The local newspapers here believe that US President Roosevelt's direct communication with the Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, Kalinin, is equivalent to the United States recognizing Soviet Russia. Public opinion has expressed great satisfaction with this matter. (21st Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Situation in the Eastern Route is Still Tense; Japan is Actively Deploying Military Forces Against Russia; Puppet Troops are Equipped with the Latest Weapons and Deployed on the Border; Japanese Military Police Command the Police to Maintain Order</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The situation of the Chinese Eastern Railway is still tense. The board of directors has met several times, but no results have been achieved, so there is no solution to the various disputes, and all affairs are still at a standstill. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changchun) After the Soviet Union announced Commander Hishikari's secret letter on October 8th, the Kwantung Army became nervous. The Hirose Division was transferred to the eastern border of Jilin Province to actively prepare for Russia. There have also been changes in the military deployment in the four eastern provinces. It is reported that the Kwantung Army's policy of ruling the four eastern provinces is as follows: (1) Actively train the puppet troops, stationing Japanese people as commanders at all levels, one to prevent the puppet troops from turning against them, and the other to improve their combat power. The puppet troops' divisions and brigades are equipped with the latest weapons to replenish their military strength and expand their combat power. (2) The puppet troops are stationed on the border to guard against anti-Japanese military actions in wartime. The border puppet troops are deployed between the Japanese troops to cut off the connection between the puppet troops' divisions and brigades. (3) Expand the Japanese military police force in Manchuria. The puppet military police force and security police force are all under the command of the Japanese military police commander, responsible for maintaining the security of the four eastern provinces and guarding against various anti-Japanese movements. (4) Step up the implementation of the Baojia system of joint liability. The Baojia in various townships are under the control of the Autonomy Guidance Association, and the Autonomy Guidance Association is under the control of the military police. The police and civilian corps are integrated to jointly assume responsibility for security. (5) The Kwantung Army needs to add railway guard troops to guard the traffic on all railways in Manchuria. (6) Permanent military facilities on the border must be carried out as soon as possible, and efforts must be made to complete its military defense project, replenish military equipment and supplies, and station elite Japanese soldiers.

<h3>The Situation on the Pacific; The US Government Allocates Huge Sums of Money to Fund National Defense; The Navy Adds New Aircraft, and the Army is Mechanized; Australia Holds an Important Position in the British Empire; Fortresses are Strengthened and Armaments are Produced Day and Night</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US Department of the Interior, which manages the funds for public buildings, today allocated 10 million yuan to the Army Department for the use of motorizing several troops, and another 15 million yuan to the Navy Department for adding new aircraft and building aircraft warehouses. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<p>▲ Melbourne News: Amidst the preparations for the Second World War, Australia will play an important role in protecting the British Empire's interests in the Pacific. Australia's defense authorities are carrying out various new defenses, such as strengthening coastal fortresses, mechanizing the army, and improving the equipment of the naval, land, and air forces. In addition, military supplies are being manufactured. A new arsenal has been established in Victoria, and its military weapons and ammunition will be supplied to the British naval forces in New Zealand, the British fleet in the East Indies, and the British fleet in China. The British naval station in South Africa may also be supplied with ammunition from this arsenal. Several types of ammunition are now being manufactured in Australia, such as the 8-inch caliber guns used in the heavy artillery of 10,000-ton cruisers. The aforementioned arsenal can now manufacture them. Recently, several cannons were sent to the United Kingdom for testing, and the results were excellent. The British inspectors greatly praised the manufacturing efficiency of the Australian gun makers. Most of the canned meat, fruit pulp, and other preserved foods used by the British fleet in Hong Kong and other Eastern British naval stations are now supplied by Australia. The Australian government has long considered re-equipping the coastal artillery. It is now planned to install a 9.2-inch caliber gun at each of the two locations in Newcastle and Sydney, and at a military key point near Fremantle, each costing about 80,000 pounds. In addition, new-style rifles and cannons are being sought. The latest-style shrapnel and field guns have been purchased. If funds are available, it is also planned to purchase new-style anti-aircraft guns from the United Kingdom to prevent enemy aircraft attacks. The new development of army mechanization is being closely watched by the Australian defense authorities. The army's transport team has already started to implement mechanization.

<h3>Hirota Hiroki Talks About Armed Diplomacy; Unique Views on US-Russian Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Hirota Hiroki departed from Tokyo Station westward yesterday afternoon to report his appointment as Foreign Minister to the Ise Grand Shrine. He said to reporters in the car, "The Five Ministers' Conference was held to find out the government's policies, especially the views on diplomacy and the national policy related to the military, which is a wing of diplomacy, and the financial problems arising from this, and the situation of various countries in the world towards Japan. I expressed my opinion on the diplomatic policy at this important time. The detailed content cannot be disclosed now. In order to maintain peace in the Orient, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, and will work hard to develop Manchuria in a sound manner as its first policy in the future. Regarding the Manchuria issue, it is the first priority to eliminate the misunderstanding of the United States, that is, to cope with the 1935 disarmament conference, it is also necessary to make full efforts to eliminate the sinister atmosphere in the United States. Also, regarding the relationship with the United Kingdom, there are many differences of opinion on commercial issues, but I believe that the results of the Seymour Conference can resolve these disputes. Although Germany and France do not understand the true intentions of Japan's Manchuria Incident, both countries have recently expressed their willingness to establish friendly relations, and Japan is also willing to increase national relations with the two countries. My mission is to increase friendly relations with the world's major countries, but the future of international relations is not optimistic, so it is not allowed to spend leisurely. In the future, the promotion of diplomacy must have sufficient national defense preparations behind it. There are those who have concerns about domestic ideological issues, but ideological issues are also the same as national defense. The country should be united as a whole. Today's Japan is most important to defend against foreign aggression and protect itself internally." (22nd Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>As for the fact that the United States today actually invited Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, it is still questionable whether this matter is the United States' recognition of the Soviet Union. It remains for us to make a clear judgment as to whether it is possible for the United States, the leader of world capitalism, to cooperate with the only communist Soviet Union in the world. If this cooperation between the two countries is regarded as suppressing Japan's position in the Far East, then their views are erroneous, and we need not make any judgment.

<h3>The German Government Dispatches a Military Attaché to Japan; The First Time Since the European War; The Date of Arrival Has Not Been Determined</h3>

The German government appointed Navy Major Weniger as the military attaché to the Japanese embassy on October 1st. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently been notified and has been approved. However, it is said that the date of arrival of the military attaché has not yet been determined.

<h3>Germany Reasonably Advocates Withdrawal from Disarmament and the League of Nations; Military Supervision is Just a Name; It is Difficult to Endure Discrimination from Various Countries; An English Public Law Scholar Defends Germany</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The special correspondent of the Kokumin Shinbun stationed in Europe has obtained the true reasons for Germany's withdrawal from the disarmament conference and the League of Nations itself from reliable sources. According to him, the purpose of the proposal put forward by British Foreign Secretary Simon on October 14th was to delay the reduction of the countries with complete armaments for another four years. This proposal was immediately passed by the delegations of important countries. Furthermore, the wording of this proposal is extremely vague, so it is still unknown whether the armaments of various countries will be truly reduced even after the four-year period expires. This depends on whether the supervision is effective, and the so-called supervision only refers to Germany's armaments. Therefore, after four years, various countries may still refuse to reduce their armaments by pretexting dissatisfaction with the supervision, or how Germany has violated its treaty obligations, etc. Even the unilateral supervision is a very dishonorable matter, which Germany cannot endure. The basis of this supervisory measure is the slander publicly promoted in Geneva, such as the new German government is an obstacle to European peace, etc. Furthermore, an important point is that the proposal does not have an explicit explanation of the extent to which the armaments of the powers will be reduced after four years, and Germany has tried its best to clearly define this point, but it has not been able to do so. Therefore, Germany deeply feels that the purpose of the powers is to infinitely reserve the armaments of various countries, and to infinitely restrict Germany. For example, the reorganization of the German National Defense Force into a short-term militia is also a point of contention, and can be used as a tool for anti-German propaganda. No matter how the German National Defense Force is reorganized, it cannot be regarded as a concession to Germany by various countries, or an increase in German military strength. Germany currently has a standing National Defense Force of 100,000 people. In the future, it will be changed to a short-term militia of 200,000 people, and its strength will only be reduced. In fact, it is Germany's concession to the powers. Comparing 200,000 guns with France's 8 million guns is already a huge disparity in strength, not to mention the other countries around Germany. Therefore, this plan is nothing more than an attempt to make Germany undergo a second disarmament. Therefore, Germany's resolute rejection cannot be regarded as an unusual move. If it is said that Germany has obtained the opportunity to rearm, and conceals the selfishness of various countries' unwillingness to reduce their armaments, then Germany will not recognize it. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Today, the famous British public law scholar Bryceford wrote an article, which was published in the New Statesman bi-monthly, defending Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations. It stated that although the British feel that they cannot arbitrarily put forward clauses to solve the disarmament problem, most people still think that it is reasonable to force obedience to our will and to put pressure on Germany. This is a great misunderstanding. "We can preserve our warships and heavy bombers, and France can also preserve its submarines. Why can't Germany have its independence? What is the reason for such injustice? And today is not the same as 1919. Today, no one deeply believes that Germany is the culprit of the European War. If Germany accuses us of not reducing our armaments and destroying the treaty ourselves, how will we answer Germany? For fourteen years, the Allied powers have not only ignored their promises to reduce armaments, but have also increased their armaments. Furthermore, countless futile meetings have been held in the past two years, and today various countries want to continue this unreasonable discrimination for four years, and the equality that exists in name only will have to wait another eight years. Anyone who has self-respect will not be able to endure this treatment." (21st National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from Aoki, the ambassador to Spain, taking advantage of the recent deterioration of relations between Japan and Russia, a letter was sent to the Japanese embassy in Madrid, the capital of Spain, on the 18th in the name of the Communist Party. The content is as follows: "Please change Japan's aggressive attitude towards the Soviet Union." On the 20th, stones were thrown at the Japanese embassy at dawn. This was the act of the Communist Party. The Spanish government is now strictly investigating the criminals and is working hard to be vigilant. (22nd Japan Federation Telegram)</p>
<h3>The US Agricultural Strike Movement; Affects the Recovery Plan; Will Use Force to Stop It if Necessary</h3>
<p>(New York) The center of the farmers' strike movement seems to be in Des Moines, Iowa. Reno, the president of the Farmers' Holiday Association, officially announced the strike there today, saying that the authorities' agricultural program is neither economically sound nor can it relieve the suffering of farmers. The farmers' requests have become frantic, and politicians are political tools controlled by Wall Street financiers. The Farmers' Holiday Association has sent people to various states in the Midwest to persuade farmers to join the strike. The purpose is to end the closure of rural mortgages. It is true that many farmers in the Midwest are in very poor circumstances, but other large agricultural institutions are unwilling to join the strike and make things difficult for the National Recovery Administration. It is said that Reno once said that farmers will not allow people to make them homeless, and if necessary, they will use force to stop such events. The impact of the farmers' actions is difficult to know in detail for a while, but the decline in stock exchange prices may be due to this. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>New Trends in US-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Recently, due to the exchange of letters and telegrams between US President Roosevelt and the Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, Kalinin, relations between the United States and the Soviet Union have clearly shown a promising atmosphere. In this rapidly changing situation, the Soviet Union will also respond to the invitation of the US President and send Litvinov to visit the White House. This "is indeed a welcome event in the dark background of today's international relations." In other words, the United States will abandon its traditional policy of non-recognition of the Soviet Union and restore normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Today, the moment of realization is almost at hand.</p>
<p>Historically, there have been three obstacles to the issue of the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union: the debt of the Kerensky government era and the war debts of the European War, the confiscation of American property within the Soviet Union, and the issue of communist propaganda. Because of these three reasons, from President Wilson to the present, through Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover, for a period of sixteen years, the United States' avoidance and rejection of the Soviet Union has seemed to have become an immutable national policy. Although today's world powers have all restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, the United States still goes its own way. In April 1928, US Secretary of State Kellogg issued a declaration "reaffirming the US government's consistent policy toward the Soviet Union" and believed that the US government's policy toward the Soviet Union was prescient. This stubborn and resolute attitude is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>Now, President Roosevelt, with a keen insight into the trend of the world, has reversed the consistent anti-Soviet policy of the past and resolutely put forward a new way to jointly solve the pending case that caused the break in relations between the United States and Russia on November 7, 1917. This further demonstrates his foresight and courage to break down barriers, and he has won high praise from international public opinion. Today, the world has reached a very serious situation, especially the situation in the Far East. Japan's militaristic behavior and its aggressive ambitions are driving the situation, and the atmosphere is increasingly ominous. To maintain world peace, to contain the raging war in the Far East, and to stop the aggressive behavior of ambitious countries and the misfortune that threatens all mankind, these two major countries in the Pacific—the United States and the Soviet Union—must abandon their old grievances, improve their relations, and sincerely join hands. Many enlightened people in the United States loudly called for the restoration of past relations with the Soviet Union after the September 18th Incident to contain the disaster in the Far East. At the same time, the Soviet government also expressed its pleasure, stating that mutual understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union is the key to preventing the flames of war. This observation is indeed correct. Therefore, the rapprochement of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union is not only due to President Roosevelt's foresight and courage, but also due to the development of the serious situation in the Far East. If, even today, the politicians of the United States and the Soviet Union still cannot sincerely join hands based on the position of maintaining world peace, then the intangible losses suffered by all mankind will be incalculable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of the United States and the Soviet Union themselves, regardless of the necessity of promoting the improvement of relations between the two countries due to the "US-Japan" and "Soviet-Japan" conflicts in the Far East, even in terms of economic interests, the US recovery plan and the Soviet Union's second five-year plan are mutually beneficial. If the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union is realized through Litvinov's visit to the White House, on the one hand, it can be said to be another fruitful result of the Soviet Union's consistent peaceful foreign policy. On the other hand, it must also be said that the United States has now truly recognized the consolidation of the Soviet Union's founding foundation and the important position it occupies internationally.</p>
<p>In short, in today's cloudy sky, when all mankind is worried about a disaster about to come, the diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union suddenly show a fresh atmosphere. It cannot but be considered a beneficial act for the world. Therefore, we are all paying serious attention to Litvinov's visit to the United States, and we cannot help but express our high hopes for its future results.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The final day of the Second National Higher Examination for ordinary administrative personnel was held on the 22nd, with 850 candidates. The examination originally scheduled for the morning was on the Constitution. However, as the Constitution had not yet been promulgated, it was changed to the Provisional Constitution. However, theories on the Constitution were also touched on. The examination in the afternoon was on economics. (A) Constitution: (1) During the period of political tutelage, which organ exercises central rule according to the Provisional Constitution?

<h3>Executive Yuan Announces Civil Servant Salary Table</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan instructed all subordinate agencies to comply with the National Government's order No. 521, which stated that the Examination Yuan reported that the Ministry of Personnel presented a draft salary table for civil servant ranks and salaries. This draft was approved by the National Government, prefixed with the term "provisional," and promulgated by decree, effective from November 1st. The salary table and regulations promulgated in the sixteenth and eighteenth years were repealed on the same day. Therefore, all agencies should conduct salary reviews in accordance with the new table from the effective date. However, there may be discrepancies between the salaries of existing personnel under the old ranks and the new table. It seems that the resolution of the National Government Committee should be followed, stating that the salaries of agencies should not be increased as a result, which would affect the total amount of the false budget. Three implementation measures were determined: (1) From the effective date of the new table, the original ranks of existing personnel in all agencies should be retained, and the original salaries should be temporarily maintained. (2) When promoted, personnel should be promoted from their original rank, and the salaries should be determined by the agencies. (3) When demoted, personnel should be demoted from their original rank, and salaries should be reduced according to the grade difference in the new table. After careful examination, the proposal is deemed appropriate and is hereby ordered to be followed. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Difficult to Raise Funds for Paper Mill</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A spokesman for the Ministry of Industry said that the Ministry sent personnel to Zhejiang to survey the site of the paper mill and used hydropower for power generation. It had contacted Shanghai businessmen, but the businessmen recently planned to establish it independently. However, it is difficult to raise funds. They plan to borrow money from the government. The government's finances have been extremely difficult in recent years, and how can a large sum of money be borrowed? Therefore, there has been no progress in this matter recently. If the Shanghai businessmen are really unwilling to cooperate, the Ministry will seek new methods to realize the paper mill. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3>The Japanese Plan to Divide Eastern Mongolia into Several Provinces; Huang Shaohong Arrives in Beiping and Will Soon Go to Mongolia to Offer Comfort; Inner Mongolian Youth Plan to Emulate Irish Autonomy; Three Major Problems Urgently Awaiting Resolution for the Mongolians</h3>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: The issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy is quite important. The central government has now dispatched Minister of the Interior Huang Shaohong to inspect Inner Mongolia. This morning (the 21st), Mr. Huang, along with secretaries, staff members, and internal personnel, boarded a train to the north. He will stay in Beiping briefly and, after Zhao Pilian arrives from the north, will go to Inner Mongolia together to offer comfort. It has also been decided to establish a Pacification Office in Zhangjiakou to facilitate contact with Mongolian princes. Mr. Huang's intention is primarily to break down the barriers between Inner Mongolia and the interior, starting with coordination. He also plans to transfer personnel familiar with the situation in Inner Mongolia from the military branch to assist in all matters. Tan Qinglin and Tao Jun are both on the list for transfer.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy, although it was convened by Prince De, each prince has his own "views." The proposals of the Xilingol League and Ulaanchab League are quite outdated, but they still lean towards the central government. The final resolution will be presided over by the central government. As for the slight movements of the Inner Mongolian army, they are under the command of a certain party. After the closing of the princes' meeting in Bailingmiao, Prince De continued to travel around, trying his best to win support. However, due to disagreements, there have been no concrete results to date. Nevertheless, Prince De is still actively working. In recent years, the thinking of Inner Mongolian youth has been quite left-leaning, and a portion of them are engrossed in the study of autonomy. Their proposals differ from those of Prince De. The youth intend to emulate Ireland's path in the United Kingdom and carry out a national autonomous movement. Therefore, they also find it difficult to cooperate with Prince De. Currently, Prince De is in a predicament due to his isolated and weak position, and the difficulty in rallying support. He is in a situation akin to riding a tiger. If Huang Shaohong, Zhao Pilian, and others can carefully assess the situation and handle it prudently, it is not difficult to salvage the situation.</p>
<p>Regarding the Eastern Mongolian area, since the September 18th Incident in Northeast China, Japan has dispatched personnel to Eastern Mongolia to instigate trouble, hoping to complete the established plan advocated by the Tanaka Cabinet. They intend to divide Eastern Mongolia into several provinces based on geographical conditions. The investigation into the division of provinces and candidates for provincial governors is as follows: (1) Eastern Province: The Mongolian Banner of Buteha will be the center of the province and an important town in Heilongjiang. For the sake of de facto smoothness, Japan has appointed Olunchun Prince Buteha as the provincial governor. (2) Northern Province: The area is located in Hailar and is an important Mongolian port in the Northeast. Japan has appointed Lin Sheng, the eldest son of Gui Fu, the Governor-General of Hulunbuir, as the provincial governor. (3) Southern Province: The central part of the Jerim League will be the scope of the province, and Prince Yanxihaishun of the Tumed Banner will be responsible as the provincial governor. However, the regulatory agency above the divided provinces is under the unified jurisdiction of the Xing'an General Office, with the Chief of the Jerim League as the Director-General and a Japanese person as the Deputy Director-General. Since the fall of Rehe, the area north of the Xilamulun River (Josutu League) has been designated as the Central Province, and Prince Zagal of the Bairin Banner, the Chief of the Josutu League, has been invited to take charge of provincial affairs. It is found that Inner Mongolia stretches from Qinghai in the west to Hulunbuir in the east, extending for thousands of miles, encompassing over a hundred banners, and with a population of over two and a half million. Their livelihoods depend entirely on animal husbandry. However, in recent years, pastures have gone bankrupt, and the people are adrift, leading a miserable life every day. According to Mongolians coming from Inner Mongolia to Beiping, the events that Inner Mongolian people feel most acutely and urgently need to be resolved in this difficult and challenging life are only three major problems: (1) Livelihood problems; (2) Security problems; (3) Border official problems. Regarding livelihood problems, since the Republic of China, the country has been implementing policies of opening up territories and settling borders with immigrants, resulting in Inner Mongolian people losing their nomadic lives, their economies collapsing, their livelihoods being cut off, and them becoming displaced, with cries of misery everywhere. Regarding security problems, in all reclaimed areas, because immigrants are increasing daily, people from all directions gather, and there is a mix of good and bad. Those who have occupations can settle down and work, but those who do not gather and plunder. As a result, bandits rise up, and society is in turmoil. Regarding border official problems, all Chinese border officials who are appointed cannot fulfill their responsibilities. Those who can maintain a clean and honest style are rare. The rest are mostly corrupt and despicable. Therefore, all kinds of darkness, such as arbitrary exploitation, forced apportionment, arbitrary arrests, strict interrogations, and false accusations and killings, are frequently seen. This phenomenon is most common in the border provinces such as Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. In this kind of miserable situation, how can over two and a half million Inner Mongolian compatriots sympathize with the central government when their lives cannot even be protected? How can they take care of other things? If Inner Mongolia is to serve the country and the entire Inner Mongolia stands on a common front with the country to resist the aggression of Japan and Russia, the minimum requirement is for the central government to assist Inner Mongolia in the following matters: (1) Quickly devise ways to relieve the lives of the people of Inner Mongolia; (2) Find ways to maintain the security of Inner Mongolia and protect their lives and property; (3) Abandon the policy of using religion as a means of control and establish a practical political power in Inner Mongolia; (4) Carefully select border officials; (5) Introduce Inner Mongolian youths with aspirations to handle banner affairs in various leagues and banners. If the above matters can be achieved, resisting Japan and defending against insults, and recovering lost Mongolian territory, may be easier. Minister Huang will come to the north, and an inspection of Inner Mongolia will of course be welcomed by the Mongolians, not to welcome Minister Huang to Inner Mongolia to offer comfort, but to welcome his investigation of the actual situation in Inner Mongolia and the relief of Mongolian suffering. As for the princes' meeting convened by De Wang, it is also hoped that Minister Huang will thoroughly investigate the inside story. (21st)</p>
<h3>Inauguration Ceremony of the Railway Ferry Across the Capital</h3>
<p>Nanjing and Pukou are separated by the Yangtze River. For more than ten years, the transportation authorities have repeatedly proposed building a bridge to connect the Jinghu and Jinpu railways, but it has never been realized. After the establishment of the Ministry of Railways, after studying the results, it was found that building a ferry was the most economical. Therefore, engineering experts were convened to conduct a detailed review and decided to adopt the method of movable approach bridges and ferry boats. Construction began on December 1, 1920, and the Ferry Engineering Office was established, with Zheng Hua as the director. At that time, the engineering costs were inevitable due to the lack of funds. In the summer of 1921, the work was suspended for several months due to the rising river water. Until the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity loan was completed in November 1921, and the funds were in place, the progress began to be smooth. It is estimated that the purchase of a ferry and all the approach bridges and other expenses from the London China Purchase Committee totaled more than 3,875,000 yuan in national currency. The ferry was named "Yangtze River" and was launched in December 1922. It was driven from England to China in April of this year. Other projects such as the bridge piers on both sides of the approach bridge were completed successively at the end of September of this year. The inauguration ceremony was held on the morning of the 22nd of this month. President Wang and others all attended in person. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>People Present</h3>
<p>The people present yesterday included Executive Yuan President Wang Zhaoming, Judicial Yuan President Ju Zheng, Central Party Headquarters representative Ye Chucang, Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu, Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming, Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua, Director of the National Government Accounting Office Chen Qicai, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, Minister of Education Wang Shijie, Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan, Capital Garrison Commander Gu Zhenglun, Police Chief Chen Zhuo, National Government Military Counselor Lu Chao, Civil Service Chief Wei Huai, Central Committee members Wang Zhengting, Wang Luyi, Zhang Daofan, Chu Minyi, Guo Chuntao, National Government member Yang Shuzhuang, and six or seven hundred people including officials from various Yuan, ministries and commissions, Chinese and foreign guests.</p>

<h3>Tight Security</h3>
<p>From 8:00 a.m. yesterday, the Xiaguan area was dispatched by the Garrison Command to dispatch a large team of military police, and the police team dispatched a security team. Fully armed, they patrolled together with the police from the 7th Bureau. Pukou was also under guard by the military police authorities, together with the road police and the police from the 7th Bureau. The police department's security vehicles and fire brigade also went to Xiaguan to deploy. Traffic near the Xiaguan and Pukou train stations was temporarily cut off. Anyone without a guest badge was not allowed to enter.</p>
<h3>Venue Layout</h3>
<p>The venue was set up on the Yangtze River ferry. In the ship, there was a horizontal plaque gifted by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Association, which read "Spanning the Natural Barrier." It was surrounded by national flags, with a table in the center with two flower baskets on either side. There was a silver tripod on the table, which was given to Ms. Yang Xiuqiong, who cut the ribbon, by the Ministry of Railways. The portrait of the Prime Minister and the party flag were hung in the center, which was extremely grand. At 9:00 a.m., officials from various Yuan, ministries and commissions, and Chinese and foreign guests boarded a special train prepared by the Ministry of Railways from Xiaguan to a place near the river ferry, disembarked, walked to the ship, and held the opening ceremony.</p>
<h3>On the Dais</h3>
<p>To the left and right of the dais, Boy Scouts from Liangguang Middle School maintained order. The presidium consisted of seven people, including Wang Zhaoming, Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Zhu Jiahua, Gu Mengyu, Chen Gongbo, Wang Zhengting, and Chen Qicai. Ms. Yang Xiuqiong also sat upright on the dais, wearing a pale lotus-colored cheongsam, and a light red soft woolen coat, with a lively attitude in her dignity.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>Chairman Gu Mengyu delivered an opening speech, saying, "The Yangtze River is the largest river in our country, known as a natural barrier in ancient times. It is difficult to cross, resulting in different customs north and south of the river, with many regrets. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, there have been repeated proposals to build a bridge, but due to the huge cost, it could not be clearly decided under difficult financial conditions. Former Minister Sun Zhesheng, in view of this, made every effort to build a ferry as a policy for developing transportation in the near future. After convening experts for careful research, it was decided to build a ferry. This move is still a pioneering undertaking in our country, and all aspects of technology are also our country's first experiment. Although the function of the ferry cannot be compared with that of a railway bridge, the transportation of goods can be facilitated, and the cost is more economical than bridges. It is truly a pioneering undertaking. During the construction period, with the support of Chinese and foreign people, it was completed in less than three years. Today's opening ceremony is not only to commemorate the opening of the ferry, but also because China's construction undertakings are numerous and await handling. The ferry construction is only one of the smallest parts. Today's ceremony commemorates the opening of the ferry on the one hand, and on the other hand, it also holds unlimited hopes for future construction undertakings."</p>
<h3>Director's Report</h3>
<p>Engineering Director Zheng Hua reported, "Today, at the opening of the ferry, I am deeply honored by the presence of ministers from various Yuan, comrades from all walks of life, and guests from all walks of life. I have this opportunity to briefly report on the construction of the ferry. The Yangtze River is the longest river in our country, with a length of more than 5,000 kilometers, without any north-south transportation buildings. In the past twenty years, although the authorities have repeatedly proposed the construction of bridges, they have failed to realize it due to economic relations. In 1920, the Ministry of Railways decided to build approach bridges and ferries. At that time, people in the society regarded this kind of construction as pioneering in our country and had many doubts, and they all believed that it was not as good as building bridges. However, they did not know that the river surface of the capital is about 3,700 feet wide and about 160 feet deep. The budget for building bridges cannot be less than 30 million yuan, while the construction of ferries is only more than 3.78 million yuan, accounting for only a little more than one-tenth of the construction cost of bridges. Therefore, social figures can understand the economic difficulties and urgent transportation needs of our country today, and there should be no doubts. As for the source of funds, design, and construction process, all the detailed information has been compiled into booklets and distributed to all sectors today. Due to time constraints, it is not necessary to report in detail again. The ferry project, from the start of construction to today, has been two years, ten months, and a half. From beginning to end, I have been involved in it, and I believe that it is by no means the power of one hand and one foot. I have been able to see its completion. The ministers and vice ministers of the past have never dispatched one more person or replaced one member for the ferry engineering office, so that they can serve with peace of mind. Director Sa of the Engineering Department provided guidance at any time, and I have benefited a lot from it. The Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou railways, within their power, have provided full assistance at all times and in all places, so as to provide all kinds of conveniences. The staff members can work harder and never slacken until the end. Every day, they work eleven hours from 5:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., regardless of cold or heat. Even though they are in the capital, close to the Ministry of Railways, and adjacent to the two Railway Bureaus, they never hope to rest because the ministries and bureaus have Saturdays or holidays, nor do they ask for benefits or complain because of overwork. On the workers' side, although it has been a year, there has been no minor labor unrest. And on weekdays, all kinds of workers can cooperate equally, regardless of boundaries. Skilled workers can also perform the duties of unskilled workers when they have some free time, and clever unskilled workers can also assist according to their ability when skilled workers are busy. Internal and external employees can all get along like family members and regard public affairs as their own affairs, which is really rare and commendable. What is especially gratifying is that no accidents have occurred from beginning to end, and no employees have been injured or disabled. Even in terms of safety, it is enough to reassure the people of the country. With the above situations, relying on the guidance of superiors, the assistance of all parties, and the efforts of employees, although military disasters and floods have been experienced in the meantime, not only has the economic aspect not exceeded the budget, but it has also been more economical. Take this opportunity to briefly report and pay my respects and thanks."</p>
<h3>Wang's Instructions</h3>
<p>President Wang gave instructions on behalf of the National Government, saying, "This ferry uses extremely economical means. According to the reports of Minister Gu and Director Zheng, the entire project only used 2.8 million yuan. Compared with the 30 million yuan for building a bridge, it has saved 26 million yuan. The function of the ferry is also equivalent to that of a bridge. It is truly an example of low cost and high efficiency. I hope that all kinds of construction undertakings in the future will take this ferry as a model, so that the government will definitely be able to save a part of the funds for other construction undertakings. The important reason for the rapid success of this ferry is that there have been no political changes in the past few years, and the technical staff have not changed due to the successive changes of government officials. There are many construction undertakings in China, such as transportation and railways, waiting to be handled. I hope that all of them will be as successful as the ferry, and at the same time, they must not be hindered by political influences so that they can be completed quickly. Then there will be great comfort for the future of construction."</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Opening</h3>
<p>After Wang finished his instructions, Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua gave a speech, and then the ribbon-cutting ceremony was held. Ms. Yang Xiuqiong cut the red and green ribbons with a silver scissor with a smile in the melodious music, and Gu Mengyu awarded a silver tripod and a flower basket. At that time, guests stood on both sides of the ferry, and three blue steel cars were loaded, and they drove to Pukou, driving straight up from the bridge pier. The action was very flexible and took a short time. The original wheeled vehicles were transported into the Tianjin-Pukou Line. The ferry still drove to the Xiaguan river bank. The guests were then entertained with tea and refreshments specially prepared by the Ministry of Railways in the pre-parked car. At twelve noon, they returned to Xiaguan Station.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Invade Shaowu in Northern Fujian; Traces of Bandits Still Exist in Jianning and Taining; The Power of the Big Knife Society in Northern Fujian Is Gradually Increasing</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: After the communist bandits in northern Fujian retreated far to Jianning and Taining on the Fujian border, Cai Tingkai returned to the province from Yanping and entrusted Chief of Staff Deng Shizeng of the Jing'an Office to preside over the Yanping incident. In recent days, they have searched and suppressed the remnants of the bandits in Nanping (i.e., Yanping) and Shunchang, and between Nanping and Shaxian. However, there are still a few scattered bandits harassing between Shaxian and Jiangle, and between Jiangle and Shunchang. Deng has ordered Liu Heding and Lu Xingbang to search and suppress them separately, striving to eliminate them within a time limit. As for the bandits who fled to Jian and Tai, the air force is bombing them every day. The bandits have suffered heavy casualties. In order to make a final struggle, they sent about 7,000 people from the 13th and 14th Divisions of the Pseudo 5th Army and the Young Pioneers Regiment from Taining on the 13th to attack Jiangle and the Guizhenyuan Brigade of Liu Heding's Division, fighting fiercely for three days and nights in Liwangcen, Yuankou Bridge, and Xinbanlu. More than a thousand bandits were killed or wounded, and Xu Yangang, the commander of the Pseudo 14th Division, was also killed in battle. The bandits' forces began to collapse, and the National Army pursued them victoriously, and has advanced to the border of Taining. The Liu Shangzhi Brigade in the rear also arrived in Shunchang from Jianou on the 15th, and made contact with the Jiangle army. As soon as the National Army Zhou Hunyuan's troops from Jiangxi advance from Lichuan and Nanfeng to the Fujian border and approach Jian and Tai, the Fujian army will also send troops from Jiangle and Mingxi (currently stationed by Lu Xingbang's troops) to attack them from both sides. It is also reported that after the Taining red bandits failed to invade Jiangle, they changed their attack to Shaowu on the 15th and fought fiercely with the Zhou Zhiqun Brigade stationed in Shaocheng at Gaojiadu Helinping in the south of the city. According to Zhou Brigade's report, the purpose of the red bandits' invasion of Shao this time was entirely to plunder the farmers' late rice to relieve the famine in the bandit area.</p>
<p>The farmers in various counties in northern Fujian originally had an organization called the Big Knife Society to defend against the bandits. The Yiting believed that it had many malpractices and had banned it in the past. However, this time it came out to assist in suppressing the red bandits, which was very effective. The bandit armies in Xiayang, Wangtai, Xiamu, and Maodi were all driven out by them. The government authorities tolerated them for their merits, and the power of the society became increasingly strong. They extorted supplies from the township people in addition to requesting food from the government authorities in the counties of Dundun, Shunchang, Nansha, Yong'an, and Mingxi. Therefore, it is feared that it will become a hidden danger for the locality. (16th)</p>
<h3>The Southern Route Army Deploys a General Attack on the Communist Bandit Area in Eastern Jiangxi; Two Columns Advance in Two Routes to Attack Yunmen Ridge; The Commander of the 4th Division Stationed in Xinfeng Suddenly Changes</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Telegram: The military affairs of suppressing bandits in southern Jiangxi have been actively deployed in recent days. The Southern Route Bandit Suppression Headquarters has telegraphed the Nanchang Bandit Suppression Headquarters, requesting instructions on the date of the general attack, and requesting that the Ministry of Finance be telegraphed to remit 600,000 yuan for the October subsidy and 500,000 yuan for bandit suppression expenses as soon as possible, so as to be distributed to the military expenses of the various bandit suppression units in the front. It is heard that the Southern Route Army's bandit suppression will be divided into two routes, undertaken by the First and Second Columns. As for the liaison and progress of the two columns, Liang Ruiyin, a major general section chief, was dispatched by the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Department to Dayu yesterday to meet with Yu Hanmou, the commander of the First Column, and accompanied Yu Hanmou on a tour of the defenses of Xinfeng, Anyuan, and Sannan, and convened the division commanders under the First Column in Anyuan to discuss the plan to encircle Yunmen. At the same time, the headquarters also dispatched Major General Staff Officer Xin Sen to Dongjiang with military maps, and then went to Jiaoling to discuss with Huang Renhuan, the acting commander of the Second Column, the Second Column's joint attack on Yunmen Ridge, and will convene the commanders of the Seventh and Eighth Divisions of the Second Column to hold a meeting at Datuo, which belongs to Pingyuan County. After deciding on the steps, they will jointly discuss the plan of action with the First Column. It is found that the old nest of the Communist bandits in eastern Jiangxi is in the vicinity of Huichang, Yudu, and Ruijin, and Yunmen Ridge is the screen of Huichang. The southeast of Yunmen is Chengjiang. At present, Chengjiang is still in the hands of the Communist bandits, and the main force is concentrated in Yunmen. Yunmen Ridge has always been known as a natural barrier. The Communist bandits used the natural stronghold and fortifications to ensure the safety of the bandit nest for several years. At present, the Southern Route Army has decided to break through Yunmen first, and then drive straight into the bandit area. In the future, the Seventh and Eighth Divisions of the Second Column will take one route and advance towards Chengjiang. The First Column will take the First Division and the 44th Division of the Guangxi Army as one route and force east from Anyuan. As for the route to attack Chengjiang, there are many mountains along the way, and over-the-mountain artillery and aircraft must be used to assist in the attack. Therefore, two companies of artillery from the Third Army have been ordered to go to Xunwu from Chao'an, and the 20th Regiment and the 24th Regiment of direct artillery, which are left in the province for training, have also been transferred to the front. As for the aircraft team stationed in Dongjiang, it is now preparing to dispatch aircraft to Yunmen Ridge to bomb the Communist bandits' fortifications. The headquarters' ordnance department has ordered the Second Ammunition Factory to rush to manufacture 500 heavy bombs and transport them to the front. Looking at the above situation, the second phase of the Southern Route Army's bandit suppression military affairs has become increasingly tense.</p>
<p>It is also reported that due to military necessity, the Southern Route Army has added Ye Zhao's First Division of the First Army, and opened Anyuan from Xinfeng, together with Wang Zanbin's division of the Guangxi Army to defend the area north of Anyuan, blocking the Communist bandits from invading the south. Ye Division pushed into Anyuan on the 12th of this month and completed the takeover. However, after the red bandits fled back from western Fujian, a large number of them gathered in eastern Jiangxi. A few days ago, two or three thousand people suddenly attacked Shanglianshaham and other places northeast of Anyuan. They invaded again on the 10th. The defenders sent a regiment to search and suppress them on the 11th, and held each other for four or five hours at Nanmuping. After that, the defenders sent a battalion from Jiaotou to reinforce them, and sent another battalion to intercept the bandit formation from Chakeng. The firepower on both sides was extremely fierce. The Communist bandits resisted stubbornly. At about 6:00 p.m., their momentum gradually became unsustainable. The defenders used artillery to bombard from afar, and the bandit formation was in chaos, and they fled in panic, scattering towards Qingxi in Huichang. More than 200 bandits were killed in this battle, and more than 40 Communist bandits were captured, and Liu Fangji, the chairman of the pseudo-Eastern District, was also captured alive. Since the Second Division of the First Army took over the defense of Anyuan, the Fourth Division of the Second Army, which was originally stationed in Banshixu and other places, has now been transferred back to Xinfeng to garrison. However, Chen Jitang suddenly transferred Zhang Meixin, the commander of the division, to serve as the lieutenant general aide-de-camp of the headquarters, and ordered him to return to the province to take office immediately. The vacancy of the commander of the Fourth Division was filled by Zhang Da, the commander of the Fifth Division. The vacancy of the commander of the Fifth Division was filled by Li Zhenliang, the commander of the 5th Division. The letter of appointment has been issued with the order. After receiving the order, Zhang Meixin returned to the province from the front on the 16th. The newly appointed Commander Zhang Da of the Fourth Division also came to the province to ask Chen Jitang and Commander Xiang Hanping for instructions. He then received an edict to go to southern Jiangxi from the province on the 18th to take over the headquarters of the Fourth Division. As for Li Zhenliang, the newly promoted commander of the Fifth Division, he is scheduled to be sworn in on the 23rd in the province, and then return to Huizhou to preside over the Fifth Division. The vacancy of the 5th Division commander will be temporarily filled by Wu Jun, the head of the training regiment of the division. (October 19)</p>
<h3>Chen Guofu Expresses Rectification of Common Chinese Problems 丨 Speech at the Welcome Reception of the Jiangsu Business Association 丨</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce held a welcome reception for the Provincial Government Chairman and committee members at the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on the 20th. Over a hundred people attended, including Chairman Chen, Director Zhao, Committee Member Yu, Director Xu representing the Construction Department, and representatives from various chambers of commerce. Chairman Yu Xiaochuan first delivered a welcome speech, followed by Qian Sunqing, representing Wuxi, who expressed the hope that provincial administration would gradually advance and alleviate the suffering of industry and commerce. Next, Wang Hongzao of Gaoyou spoke, hoping that the government would pay attention to public security, finance, education, and water conservancy construction, with cooperation between the Party and local areas. Chen Guofu then gave a speech, saying, "I am very grateful for your warm hospitality today. I was unable to participate in your meeting yesterday. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly express my thoughts. However, my colleagues and I have been ordered to come to Jiangsu with two hopes for how to govern Jiangsu well. To achieve these hopes, first, the people of Jiangsu must connect with politics and work together. As a person from Zhejiang, I dare to try this because Zhejiang and Jiangsu are adjacent, sharing the Taihu Lake basin. The two provinces share similar customs and traditions. I have a deeper understanding of the business situation. I believe that the main reason for the decline of Chinese commerce today is the oppression of external forces. The country lacks the strength to make industry and commerce independent. However, in this predicament, we must find a way out. To overcome this obstacle, China has a common problem, which is that everyone is moving towards 'extravagance.' This trend is not only evident in politics but also in commerce. The establishment of a store is very difficult, but the expenses are greater than before, and the quality of goods is not as solid as before. Cheap, substandard foreign goods then exploit this weakness and enter the Chinese market. Such empty extravagance affects both merchants and industry, resulting in losses for both sides. It would be better for everyone to be frugal. Another common problem is 'corruption.' Corruption exists in all sectors of China, especially in the business community. There is corruption between government departments managing funds and banks and money houses. There is also corruption between all merchants and local governments. Chinese people not only do not seek to eliminate corruption, but society also tolerates it. For example, the value of tea and snacks purchased by an institution does not match the bill, or the distance traveled on a tram does not match the fare. This is corruption between institutions and merchants, passengers and ticket buyers. Such habits can become natural. Society not only does not sanction them but also encourages crime and collusion. We must hope that everyone will unite with the government to correct this. The purpose of commerce is to diligently seek profit. If someone in society becomes rich through business, they should be admired. However, today's society only admires people's wealth without asking how they became rich. Corrupt officials leave with their pockets full. Although they may be criticized temporarily in one place, they are still admired and envied by most people when they return to their hometowns. The decline of integrity is lamentable. I hope that local people, especially merchants, will not blindly admire wealthy people. They must recognize justice. As for the failure of various factories today, it goes without saying that it is due to external forces. However, at least their internal weaknesses are also fatal. For example, the profit or loss of a cotton yarn factory depends on the gain or loss of purchasing cotton. If there is corruption in the cotton purchase, even without external pressure, this alone is enough to destroy the factory. Therefore, under the external pressure on Chinese industry and commerce, we must start with internal rectification of factories. There are many things in Jiangsu that need to be reformed and developed. My colleagues and I are ashamed of our inability to do so. Politics and commerce are closely related. The above is just a temporary reflection. I hope to have another opportunity to discuss it further in the future." (October 22nd)</p>
<h3>Dispute over Levying Contributions at the Suzhou Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>The county government ordered vegetable vendors and stallholders in the Yuyuxiang, Taiping Bridge, and Jili Bridge areas to move into the small vegetable market built in the Xiliku, but the stallholders refused to move into the market because they were oppressed by merchants who collected taxes and extorted contributions. The merchants in those areas also supported the stallholders, which led to a major dispute. Now, the county government has strictly ordered all stallholders to move in within five days. If they do not move in, it will be enforced. Residents of the four towns of Taiping, Shengping, Changchun, and Youlan have entrusted their respective town offices to submit a petition to the county government to oppose the levy of contributions and to jointly invest with various shops to build another vegetable market near Taiping Bridge.</p>
<h3>Thorough Investigation of Embezzlement of Military Funds</h3>
<p>More than 10,000 yuan was allocated to various districts in the former Fiscal Bureau of Weiting, Yaoguo, and Xietang for the expenses of digging trenches. It was distributed to villagers who worked for power, but the villagers in each township did not receive it. Therefore, it is believed that it has been embezzled by the respective district offices. The County Farmers' Association has presented a case to the county government for a thorough investigation. The Wuxian Journalists' Association yesterday (22nd) resolved at a cadre meeting to submit a petition to the county government to quickly investigate and severely punish the district chiefs of each district.</p>
<h3>Robbery Occurs in Caojing Township, Songjiang</h3>
<p>At around 11:00 PM the night before, seven or eight bandits armed with sharp weapons and flashlights broke into the home of Zhang Tang, a farmer in the 22nd Tu of Caojing. Tang Rong and his son woke up in shock and tried to escape, but they were grabbed by the bandits, tied with ropes, and beaten severely. They were ordered to hand over their hidden silver, causing injuries to their hands and feet. The bandits then looted clothing, silver dollars, cloth, and other items from the house and left with a whoop. The reported loss is about several hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>New Building of Changzhou Wujin Hospital Completed</h3>
<p>The president of Wujin Hospital, Bede (an American), went to the United States to raise donations to build a new hospital in Changzhou. Bede received more than 30,000 US dollars, equivalent to about 140,000 Chinese dollars, from Ms. Stevenson in that country. Last winter, the funds were remitted, and preparations were made for design and bidding. The construction was contracted to the Wuxi Industrial Construction Company and was fully completed in October of this year. The hospital president sent a letter yesterday (21st) inviting people from all walks of life to the hospital to hold a completion ceremony, which was quite grand.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Prosecutor Hu Inspects Wuxi</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangsu Higher Court, Hu Yigu, visited various counties in stages to understand the judiciary in each county in order to rectify it. The day before yesterday afternoon, Chief Prosecutor Hu, accompanied by Chief Secretary Yu Hao, came to Wuxi from Suzhou by car. After getting off the car, they went directly to the County Court, where Chief Prosecutor Zhou Erkai came out to greet them. After a brief conversation, they were led to inspect the interior. Then, they went to inspect the County Prison, the Detention Center, and the County Sub-station. The inspection was quite thorough. Yesterday (22nd) morning, Mr. Hu left Wuxi for Suzhou and will visit other counties in the next few days.</p>
<h3>The Confusing Private Settlement of a Opium Case</h3>
<p>Some days ago, it was rumored in the city that Hua Dazhang, the owner of the Huatai Clothing Store in Jingqiao outside the city gate, was arrested for smoking opium. Mi Fengxun, Mi Yaoting, and Zhu Pusheng interceded on his behalf and paid 100 yuan to Mao Yijun, the head of the Second Public Security Bureau, and 150 yuan to arrange for the suspect to be escorted to the court. Afterwards, the county government thoroughly investigated the matter, as reported in this newspaper. However, the Wuxi Daily reported that someone named Yuan interceded and paid bail to the court in the form of a written guarantee. That night, 250 yuan was paid to Yuan for handling the matter. After seeing the report, the County Court Prosecutor's Office believed that the news was ambiguous, so it sent a letter to the Wuxi Daily the day before yesterday, requesting the name of the contributor for verification. After receiving the letter, the newspaper voluntarily corrected itself the next day, saying that the news was completely untrue. Yesterday afternoon, the Prosecutor's Office ordered Hua Dazhang, Mi Fengxun, and Mi Yaoting to appear in court. Shen, the prosecutor, opened the court for interrogation and ordered Hua Dazhang to be detained, while Mi Fengxun and others were ordered to return and await investigation. Before one wave subsided, another rose again. Yesterday, a certain newspaper in the city reported that the Second Public Security Bureau dispatched officers Sun Zhongjie, Wang Shucai, and Wu Quan at around 1:00 AM the night before, leading police to check Room 43 of the Wuxi Hotel and found opium offenders Fei Liansheng and Mi Dongsheng, along with opium paraphernalia. They were taken to the bureau, but someone interceded and released them for 300 yuan, of which 100 yuan was given to Director Wu of the General Bureau by Director Cheng of the Second Bureau. However, when asked, the Second Bureau denied the private settlement, and the hotel also claimed that only travelers were taken to the bureau and there were no opium paraphernalia. The inside story is complicated and unclear. However, it is said that the Second Bureau is now conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang Elementary School Students Poisoned by Noodles</h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday (19th), Wang Huaibao, Liu Shijin, both seven years old, Chen Zhifa, nine years old, Mou Shunxing, eleven years old, Zhou Zhan'ao, twelve years old, Liu Shixing, fifteen years old, and Zhang Ransheng, twenty years old, students from a nearby private school in Hexi Liuzi Alley, went to Hu Baotong Noodle Restaurant at the entrance of the alley to eat noodles. Unexpectedly, after eating, each person suffered from abdominal pain and vomiting, similar to the symptoms of an epidemic. It was suspected that there was poison in the noodles. The families sent them to the nearby Deutsche Hospital for treatment before their condition improved. However, it has not yet been confirmed what poison was in the noodles.</p>
<h3>Cleaning Campaign in Five Counties of Nantong to Be Held Next Month</h3>
<p>The county chiefs and water and land police team leaders of the five counties of Nantong, Rugao, Chongming, Haimen, and Qidong continued to discuss the cleaning campaign in Tong on the 21st. Cheng Yuyan and Cao Pang were appointed as the general supervisors of the cleaning campaign. The campaign will begin on November 1st to search for and suppress hidden bandits, brand and inspect firearms, and ban disbanded civilian militiamen. After the cleaning campaign, key areas will be selected to set up defensive works to maintain permanent public security.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou Police Team Captures Three Bandits</h3>
<p>The captain of the county police team, Zhu Hua, in order to eliminate banditry in the four townships, specially sent plainclothes police to investigate bandit tracks in various townships. The day before yesterday, Captain Zhu received a report from plainclothes police stating that there was a bandit den under the brick bridge east of Wangyingzhen in the Fifth District. Captain Zhu secretly ordered the third squad leader, Tan Shuren, to lead the team to arrest them. They captured the bandit leader Chen Xiaomianzi and the bandits Liu Xiaohongzi and Jin Changyong, and seized firearms and ammunition. They were escorted to the city last night (19th) and transferred to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Judgment in the Fraud Case of a Detective from the Jiaxing Water Police</h3>
<p>Bao Fugui and his son, farmers in Qianliu Township, the seventh district of Jiaxing, were extorted 500 yuan by Jiang Xianfa, a detective from the First Brigade of the Water Police, in collusion with Zhou Zhipeng, Zhang Yanli, Wang Yuzuo, Peng Yuquan, Peng Jingru, and Wang Aliu. The victims reported to the Prosecutor's Office, and after investigation, the charges were found to be true. A public prosecution was filed. Except for Wang Yuzuo and Peng Yuquan, who have been sentenced to fines by the court separately, Jiang Xianfa and others are still at large and the case is still unresolved. Now, Jiang Xianfa has been arrested by the Water Police and sent to the court. The trial has ended, and the judgment was announced yesterday: Jiang Xianfa was sentenced to two years of imprisonment for extortion and restriction of freedom.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin Returns to His Hometown, Passing Through Shanghai Yesterday Morning 丨 Passed Wusong at 9:00 AM Yesterday Morning Without Landing 丨 Arrives in His Hometown at 3:00 PM This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Riri News reports that President Lin Sen of the National Government, in view of the rampant bandits in Fujian, although gradually suppressed, the hometown after the disaster is inevitably filled with mourning. Always thinking of his hometown, now that the autumn is high and the sky is clear, and the time is right, he has specially taken the time to return to Fujian to visit relatives and sweep graves. President Lin boarded the Yingrui warship from Xiaguan, Nanjing, at 7:30 PM the night before yesterday and passed Wusong at 9:00 AM yesterday morning without stopping, heading directly to Fujian. The details obtained by the Riri News reporter are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>According to news from the Naval Headquarters, President Lin was on the Yingrui warship, which set sail from Xiaguan, Nanjing, at 7:30 PM the night before yesterday. The report stating the Yong Sui warship was an error. Accompanying him were Military Advisor Mao Zhongfang, Secretary Lin Yushi, and Adjutant Zhang Zhong, among others. Li Shijia from the Navy also accompanied him. The ship passed Wusong at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Because there was still plenty of fuel, it did not stop and went directly to Fujian.</p>
<h3>Arrives in Fujian Today</h3>
<p>President Lin's hometown is Minhou County, Fujian Province. Because the Minjiang River is shallow, the warship cannot sail close to the city walls and must dock at Mawei, Fuzhou. He must then transfer to a small steamship to land at Nantai outside the city. Based on the ship's speed, it is estimated that it will take about 44 hours from Nanjing to reach the destination. It is estimated that it will arrive at Mawei at about 3:00 PM this afternoon. After arriving in Fujian, the Yingrui warship will not go anywhere else and will wait for President Lin to board and return to Nanjing after a week.</p>
<h3>Tang Youren Discusses Diplomacy 丨 Sino-Vietnamese Trade Agreement to Be Signed Soon 丨 Tax on Imported Rice Is Underway</h3>
<p>Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tang Youren came to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed him at his residence and inquired about the latest developments in diplomacy. He replied as follows:</p>
<h3>Sino-Vietnamese Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>Regarding the signing of the Sino-Vietnamese trade agreement, since French Ambassador Weidun entered Nanjing several times to negotiate with our foreign affairs authorities, everything has been resolved. It will be signed very soon. Once the agreement is signed, our country will immediately send consuls to Vietnam to handle the commercial affairs of overseas Chinese in the area. The locations for the consulates have not yet been decided. Generally, consulates will be established in major trading ports in Vietnam and areas where a large number of overseas Chinese reside.</p>
<h3>Tax on Imported Rice</h3>
<p>The collection of tax on imported rice is not only related to the income of the national treasury but also to the rural economy. Therefore, the central government believes that the collection of tax on imported rice is extremely urgent. However, how to proceed should be carefully considered. All countries have not expressed any opinions regarding our country's plan to collect tax on imported rice. Only the French ambassador inquired verbally. However, most of the overseas Chinese in Vietnam are engaged in the rice industry, so the collection of tax on imported rice will have a considerable impact on them. It should also be taken into account within the possible scope. In short, the collection of tax on imported rice is a unanimous demand of the entire country.</p>
<h3>Luo's Mission</h3>
<p>The former Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, Jin Shuren, signed an illegal commercial treaty with the Soviet Russian government during his tenure, which had long been denied by the Ministry. Foreign Minister Luo Wengan went to Xinjiang to negotiate with the Russian side to terminate this illegal commercial treaty. As for the establishment of the Xinjiang Foreign Affairs Office by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Xinjiang Province, Wu Aichen has been appointed to preside over it and it has now been established.</p>
<h3>Three Envoys to Take Office</h3>
<p>Our country's newly appointed Minister to Italy, Liu Chongjie, Minister to Portugal, Zhang Xinhai, and Minister to Belgium, Zhang Naiyan, have all decided to leave Shanghai on November 14th to take up their new posts. Before leaving the country, the three ministers will jointly visit Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Minister of Finance Song Ziwen to Meet with Reporters Today 丨 To Issue Important Remarks</h3>
<p>Minister of Finance Song Ziwen came to Shanghai from Nanjing on the Yangtze River Customs patrol vessel Xiaguang the day before yesterday to discuss the selection of members for various control committees such as the Grain and Silk Industry Committee of the National Economic Council. It is reported that Mr. Song is scheduled to meet with reporters from various newspapers at 10:00 AM today (23rd) at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance on West Ainsworth Road to issue important remarks.</p>
<h3>Recent Status of the Ministry of Industry's Active Preparation for Establishing Five Factories 丨 Alcohol and Paper Mills to Be Established Soon 丨 Machinery and Sulfuric Acid Factories Await Opening 丨 Steel Factory Contract Under Review</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News reports that Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, in order to develop industry and restore rights, has formulated a four-year industrial plan and is planning to establish steel, alcohol, paper, machinery, and sulfuric acid factories. Since the active implementation, considerable progress has been made. The recent progress of each factory, as learned by Xin Xin News reporters, is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Alcohol Factory Contract Signed</h3>
<p>The capital of the alcohol factory planned and established by the Ministry of Industry is 1 million yuan. It is jointly operated by the Ministry of Industry and overseas Chinese Huang Jiangquan and others. Since the consultation on the joint venture contract between the two parties, all procedures have been negotiated and formally signed in Nanjing on the 21st. The main points of the contract are roughly as follows: (1) The capital of 1 million yuan is advanced by Huang alone, and the Ministry of Industry receives one-tenth, totaling 100,000 yuan, which will be returned in installments from the alcohol factory's surplus in the future; (2) The alcohol factory must be completed and produce alcohol within one year, otherwise the contract will be canceled and the 50,000 yuan deposit will be confiscated; (3) Priority will be given to domestic raw materials for winemaking. As for the factory site, a suitable location is currently being sought in Shanghai, and it is expected that a decision will be made soon so that it can be opened first.</p>
<h3>Steel Factory Contract Under Review</h3>
<p>The capital of the steel factory is 80 million yuan, which is jointly operated with the German Hope Company. After several thorough discussions between the two parties, the draft contract has been negotiated and finalized. However, the Ministry of Industry believes that the various equipment of the factory is of great importance to our country's entire national defense. For the sake of prudence, the entire plan for preparing the steel factory and the draft contract have been submitted to the National Economic Council for review.</p>
<p>Therefore, the formal signing date of the factory contract must wait until the Economic Council has completed its review before it can be scheduled.</p>
<h3>Paper Mill Actively Preparing</h3>
<p>Since it was decided that the paper mill would be jointly operated by the government and merchants, the capital is 5 million yuan, of which 2 million yuan is merchant shares, which has been jointly subscribed by the Commercial Press, Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, and Shishi Xin Bao, and is being raised. As for the 3 million yuan in government shares, the Ministry of Industry is planning and will decide soon. The factory site has been decided to be Xiaoxi in Qingtian County, Wenzhou. The construction costs for various buildings such as the base, houses, warehouses, water and power plants have also been drafted. It is estimated that after opening, the daily output can produce 25 tons of mechanical wood pulp, 10 tons of ammonia sulfuric acid wood pulp, and 35 tons of newsprint in total. According to the plan, rolled and loose paper will be manufactured at the same time. The annual output can be 10,550 tons of paper, which is estimated to be 2.31 million yuan at 200 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Machinery Factory Raising Funds</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Industry has been actively preparing for the machinery factory, it has been largely completed. 123,200 pounds have been borrowed from the British Boxer Indemnity to purchase machinery. The Ministry has negotiated with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board. The Ministry has purchased more than 300 mu of land in Xiaguan for the factory site. The most urgent task to be solved is the construction of the machine factory and the raising of working capital. Once the above problems are solved, procedures for opening the factory can be carried out.</p>
<h3>Sulfuric Acid Factory Awaits Opening</h3>
<p>The sulfuric acid and ammonium factory was originally planned to be jointly operated by the Ministry of Industry, the British Brunner Mond Company, and the German Aegis Company, with a capital of 15 million yuan. Our country will invest 8 million yuan, and the British and German companies will each invest 3.5 million yuan. The three parties have also drafted a draft agreement, but the conditions set by the British and German companies are very harsh, and there has been no indication of continued negotiations to date, which shows that the other party has no sincerity, so it has been suspended. The Ministry of Industry is now planning to operate it independently, reducing the capital from 15 million to 7 million yuan, and has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to allocate 7 million yuan in US cotton loans to carry out the project, but it has not yet been approved. Therefore, the opening of the factory is still pending.</p>

<h3>Beiping Train Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the Beining, Jinpu, and Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureaus announced the implementation of Shanghai-Beiping direct joint transportation, a capital railway ferry crossing fee was uniformly charged, and first and second class sleeper tickets were sold. The Beining Road between Beiping and Tianjin charged a special express fee and canceled the education fee. The 302nd Shanghai-Beiping direct through train from Beiping the day before yesterday arrived at Pukou at 3:05 PM yesterday afternoon and boarded the Changjiang ferry, which arrived at Xiaguan Station. At 5:25 PM, it headed south from Xiaguan and arrived at Shanghai North Station at 11:55 PM last night. The through train is a Blue Steel car from the Jinpu Road, which is exceptionally stable and eliminates the need to change trains in Nanjing. Passengers praised the convenience.</p>

There is one round trip between Beiping and Shanghai every day. Jinpu Road has five trains, Beining Road has one train, and Beijing-Shanghai Road has one train. However, one train from the Beijing-Shanghai Road is being rushed to be built by the Wusong Machinery Factory.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Industry Association Advocates Severe Punishment for the Eight Firms</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice and Grain Industry Association has expressed extreme indignation at the eight rice firms purchasing Japanese rice. Yesterday, they issued two official letters, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To Party and Government Organs: A petition regarding the import of Japanese rice affecting farmers' livelihoods, requesting severe sanctions to serve as a strong warning. It has been discovered that eight rice firms in Nanshi, namely Shen Feng Rice Firm (王蔭堂), Yong Da (永大), Wan Xing (萬興), Da Feng (達豐), Nai Tai (鼐泰), Xin Feng (新豐), Chang Mao (長茂), and Ren Cheng (仁成), are purchasing and importing 24,986 bags of enemy rice from a certain foreign firm affiliated with Japanese merchants at a time when the entire nation is united in hatred against Japan. It is confirmed that the rice was loaded in Moji, Japan, and transported to Shanghai via the Japanese ship "Himalaya Maru." After the initial batch is sold, continuous purchases and shipments are planned. At a time when the rural economy is bankrupt and farmers are fortunate to have a promising autumn harvest, providing a slight respite, they are suddenly burdened by a large quantity of enemy rice, which is akin to adding insult to injury. The small number of treacherous merchants undoubtedly disregard the lives of 350 million farmers and are unconcerned about pushing the entire nation-state into peril. The national shame of the September 18th Incident has not been avenged, and the blood from the January 28th Incident is still fresh. Such heartless and inhumane behavior is beyond comprehension. The association convened a special meeting and resolved: (1) To petition the Party and government organs to swiftly and urgently dispose of the enemy rice. (A) All of this enemy rice should be used for disaster relief in areas affected by bandits and floods. (B) All of this enemy rice should be used for grain storage. (A and B) Either option should be implemented urgently, or each should be implemented by half. (2) To request the investigation and sealing of the eight rice firms and to prosecute the managers of each firm for the crime of collusion with the enemy, so as to serve as a strong warning to those who, following the enemy's military aggression, willingly act as the enemy's pawns in economic aggression and attempt to betray the nation. We are specially submitting this case for your consideration and earnestly request that your esteemed office, mindful of the severity of the national crisis and the cries of distress from farmers in all regions, make an urgent decision without leniency. We are waiting anxiously for your instructions. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department and the Director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, Mr. Wu.</p>
<p>Reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Respectfully replying, we received your esteemed association's letter, which stated that this association previously received a letter from the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, reporting that more than one million stones of Japanese rice were planned to be sold in China, and the first batch of 25,000 stones has already been shipped. It is now reported that the first batch of Japanese rice has arrived at warehouses in Shanghai, and there are reports that it has been accepted by eight firms, including Shen Feng in Nanshi. In addition to sending a letter to the Rice Firm Association to investigate and handle the matter, as it concerns obstructing domestic agricultural products and undermining the agreement to boycott enemy goods, your esteemed association must caution fellow businesses to refuse to associate with them, build a strong defense, and not be taken advantage of by the enemy in order to fulfill the merchant's duty to save the nation. It is of utmost importance that you report back on the actions taken. We have learned that our country is founded on agriculture, and due to repeated foreign invasions and internal strife, the rural economy is already bankrupt, and the cries of distress can be heard everywhere. Now, fortunately, the autumn harvest is in sight, providing a slight respite, but these eight firms, including Shen Feng Rice Firm, dare to commit such a heinous act that harms farmers and hastens the destruction of the nation. First, the farmers' livelihoods will be cut off. The old and weak will inevitably end up in ditches, while the strong will be forced to take risks, inevitably leading to incitement by communist bandits and fueling their poisonous flames. These rice firms are thus no less than disruptors of the anti-communist work, aiding the bandit scourge, and instigating internal strife. Second, the Japanese imperialists, believing that military aggression is insufficient to destroy our nation and people, are also engaging in economic aggression to hasten our demise, especially through the most poisonous tactic of oppressing farmers' livelihoods. These rice firms are clearly colluding with them, betraying the nation-state, and are collaborators committing the crime of treason. Shanghai is the financial hub of the nation, where the lifeblood of the country is entrusted. The invasion of a large quantity of enemy rice is equivalent to a large quantity of blood flowing out. Thinking of the future, we cannot help but shudder. Following the previous letter, we immediately convened a special emergency meeting and decided, in addition to petitioning the Party and government organs to swiftly confiscate all of the enemy rice and use it for disaster relief for those affected by bandits and floods, or to use it for grain storage, and to investigate and seal the eight rice firms and prosecute the managers of the firms for treason, we respectfully request that your esteemed association implement the agreement to boycott enemy goods, stop the firms' deposit withdrawals and remittances, and notify all merchants in the city and the country not to privately engage in transactions or provide financial accommodations to these firms. If any banks or merchants do not cooperate with this type of sanction, they will also be subject to the same sanctions once discovered, in order to deter those who betray the country for profit. Our entire association will strictly follow your letter, announce it to all customers and domestic colleagues, and vow to be the backbone of your esteemed association. We are specially replying to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends a Telegram Requesting the Release of Hainan Brown Sugar: It Concerns the Livelihood of Farmers and the Prosperity and Decline of Commerce in Qiongya; Adulteration with Foreign Sugar is Unreasonable and Should be Rectified Quickly</h3>
<p>The Hainan brown sugar industry has been deemed by the customs to have been adulterated with foreign sugar, and they have been ordered to pay fines. Sugar merchants believe that this matter concerns the future of brown sugar and have specially elected Xing Juefei as their representative to petition in Beijing. Mr. Xing has already arrived in Shanghai and has gone to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations to request assistance. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that this matter concerns the domestic sugar production and has specially submitted a report to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, requesting them to uphold justice and exonerate the sugar merchants. The original text is recorded as follows: A petition regarding the request. On the 20th of this month, a letter from Xing Juefei, a representative of the Qiongya sugar merchants from the Haikou Municipal Chamber of Commerce in Qiongzhou, stated in brief: "The Qiongzhou Customs is devastating brown sugar and levying huge fines, which hinders the livelihoods of sugarcane farmers and sugar merchants. Therefore, I have been dispatched as a representative to go to Beijing to present the situation to the central Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry and request: (1) To ensure the safety of Qiongya brown sugar exports in the future and order the Ministry of Finance to instruct customs commissioners of all customs offices not to deliberately create difficulties for future exports of Qiongya brown sugar; (2) To replace the Qiongzhou Customs Commissioner who has illegally devastated the sugar industry; (3) To order the Qionghai Customs to return the fines; (4) To order the Jianghai Customs to release the brown sugar detained on behalf of the Qiongzhou Customs and return the fines in order to protect the local sugar industry of Qiongya and redress the grievances of the sugar merchants, and to provide practical assistance, which would also be fortunate for the national commerce." Upon investigation, the brown sugar produced in Qiongzhou is transported to various places. Since April of this year, customs offices have been accusing the sugar of being adulterated with foreign sugar, and confiscations or fines have occurred almost every month. Foreign sugar has heavy tariffs and high prices, and selling it mixed with brown sugar would mean that merchants would suffer losses due to price reductions and also face the risk of being detained and fined. It is generally believed that there is no reason to do this. After imported foreign goods pay taxes, they are transported to other ports, and no further customs duties are usually required. If sugar merchants want to sell foreign sugar, why not report it as foreign sugar for re-export and instead mix it with brown sugar and pay an additional brown sugar re-export tax? All of this is unreasonable. Moreover, the Qiongzhou sugar production has already had representatives from the Pacification Commissioner's Office, the Customs Superintendent, and the Bureau of Industry go to various areas to collect sugar samples and conduct mutual inspections. The quality of the "Crossroads" brown sugar is consistent with the quality of the sugar from Yongcheng that was detained in July, so the truth of this case is not difficult to investigate. Furthermore, a batch of sugar goods from merchant firms such as Jusheng, which were fined by the Qiongzhou Customs, was transported to Hunan and Shanghai, and the customs offices in those two places issued written proof that they were indeed domestic goods. The Qiongzhou Customs still refuses to return the fines and is still appealing to the Customs Administration. Based on the above situation, it is clear that the Qiongzhou Customs' handling of the brown sugar case is not fair and impartial. As it concerns the rise and fall of sugar production on Qiong Island, this association must not only advocate for the sugar merchants but also appeal for the rural areas of Qiongzhou. Therefore, we are submitting this report based on the facts and respectfully request that your esteemed Yuan and Ministries review and approve the four items requested by the representatives and instruct them to handle them separately in order to exonerate them and maintain sugar production, which would be a matter of public convenience.</p>

<h3>Liaodong Volunteer Army's Deng Tiemei Requests Assistance: Support Association Decides to Donate 1,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The local Volunteer Army Support Association recently received a report from Deng Tiemei, commander of the Liaodong Volunteer Army, regarding the combat operations and the condition of the soldiers of his unit, requesting immediate relief. The following is Deng's report (formal address omitted): "Tiemei has been resisting Japan to save the country for two years now. The troops are all volunteers and purely for the sake of saving the country. They initially had no desire for fame or profit, nor any other ulterior motives. This is a commitment that can be witnessed by heaven and earth. Moreover, since Tiemei raised the standard of revolt, his unit of several thousand men has fought in over a hundred battles, large and small, against the Japanese and their puppets. (Omission) I have already disbanded several thousand of my troops, who are now hiding in various places and villages. There are still more than two thousand men, many of whom have no homes to return to and are displaced, or who are afraid of being killed because of their reputation for resisting Japan. Tiemei personally leads these men, seeking ways to survive. These officers and soldiers have shared life and death with Tiemei and are inseparable. Our army's operational areas, such as Fengcheng, Andong, and Benxi counties, are places where we can live peacefully because of the love and support of the people. Whether for the sake of the country, the people, or myself, Tiemei will only resist to the end and never surrender. If the lost territory can be recovered, I will disarm and return to my fields, happily enjoying the blessings of a free citizen. Otherwise, I will only sacrifice myself in order to live up to the expectations of the officers and soldiers of my unit and the suffering people of Liaodong, who depend on each other and share life and death. I previously sent Wang Chunian, the commander of the first detachment, into the pass with orders to consult with the comrades of the National Salvation Support Association and seek assistance. I hope that you will remember the pain of the people of Northeast China who have lost their country and the sacrifices made by the volunteer army and make further efforts to encourage them so that their hearts will not die and they can prepare for future opportunities to work. If Northeast China cannot be recovered, please reveal the situation of Tiemei's troops, who have sacrificed their families and lives to save the country, to the people of the nation so that they will know that even if we die in Northeast China, we will never be ghosts of a lost nation and will vow to coexist with Northeast China. Please also tell our displaced compatriots within the pass. Moreover, my officers and soldiers have suffered disaster for the sake of saving the country and lost their homes for resisting Japan. Our hearts are filled with sorrow and we cannot control ourselves. Moreover, as autumn ends and winter approaches, we are fighting all year round. Our bellies may be empty, but we can endure it. The cold is hard to bear. Our bodies can be killed, but our hearts truly ache. Thinking of the loyal hearts of my volunteer army who are serving the country and the people, if there is a way to help us, Tiemei will close my eyes and be at peace, and I will repay you with gratitude even in death. In the spring, the Support Association allocated 10,000 yuan, which I immediately distributed to my subordinates. If you are able to show compassion again, I beg you to continue to provide urgent relief. Otherwise, without immediate help, the loyal souls who died in battle will become ghosts who died of hunger and cold. How can we endure this situation? Therefore, I dare to report this to you and humbly beg for your consideration. My words are painful and my emotions are long, and I cannot express everything I want to say. I eagerly await your instructions. With utmost respect, I wish you peace. The Liaodong Volunteer Army Commander, Deng Tiemei, respectfully reports."</p>
<p>After receiving this report, the Volunteer Army Support Association immediately convened its 18th regular meeting and decided to allocate 1,000 yuan to assist Deng Tiemei's troops.</p>
<h3>Tokugawa Returns to Japan This Morning; Sugimura Flew from Beijing to Hankou Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, Japanese dignitaries Tokugawa Iemasa and Sugimura Yotaro, after arriving in China, visited Huang Fu, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee, He Yingqin, Chairman of the Military Council, Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, and Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is now learned that Sugimura flew from Beijing to Hankou yesterday morning and will return to Shanghai in two or three days before heading south to Guangdong. Tokugawa Iemasa came to Shanghai that night after visiting Wang and is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the Japanese ship "Shanghai Maru" around 9:00 this morning to return to Japan. He will report to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the visits and discussions with various dignitaries in our country. Observers in diplomatic circles believe that the two men came with a diplomatic mission. After their arrival in China, their most obvious actions were to inspect public sentiment and inquire about the diplomatic views of key government figures in order to explore diplomatic relations with China. Moreover, Japan recently changed its foreign minister, and the Five-Minister Conference has just concluded. This kind of reference to diplomatic methods is even more necessary. Furthermore, according to Tokugawa Iemasa's remarks, although he did not touch on political issues when he visited Wang, he briefly described the situation in the Far East and expressed regret for not being able to visit Chiang (Kai-shek) and Song (Ziwen). Therefore, although Sugimura and Tokugawa stated that they had no mission when they first arrived in Shanghai, in fact, discerning people could tell. In addition, after returning to Japan, Sugimura will go to Hong Kong and Guangdong to visit Hu Hanmin, Chen Jitang, and others, suggesting that his mission in China is not yet completed. It is reported that Tokugawa will arrive in Kobe on the 25th and immediately return to Tokyo to report on his mission.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Flight to Launch Tomorrow: Mail First, Passengers in a Month</h3>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation issued a notice yesterday stating that the Shanghai-Guangdong route of the company is scheduled to officially launch on October 24. On that day, it will fly from Shanghai to Guangzhou, on the 25th from Guangzhou to Shantou, and on the 26th from Shantou back to Shanghai. After that, there will be two round trips each week, south on Tuesdays and Fridays, and north on Wednesdays and Saturdays. For the time being, it will only carry mail, and passengers will be carried one month later. The Shanghai Postal Administration and the company have commemorative envelopes for the launch of the route, selling for five cents each. The quantity is limited, so those who wish to purchase them should do so as soon as possible.</p>
<p>After the company confirmed the launch date, Huang Baoxian, the company's business director, went to Guangzhou and actively prepared to complete all the preparations that had not yet been completed. Mail will be carried first, and passengers will be carried one month later. All mail is scheduled to be packed and sealed tonight and will take off from Longhua at 6:05 tomorrow morning on a Sikorsky aircraft, arriving in Guangzhou at 5:05 that afternoon. The next day (the 25th), it will fly back from Guangzhou at 2:30 in the afternoon, spending the night in Shantou that night. It will leave Shantou at 6:05 in the morning of the 26th and arrive at Longhua Airport at 3:00 in the afternoon. All personnel and pilots who will be flying to Guangdong tomorrow can be confirmed today. Huang Baoxian is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the plane on the 25th.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Conducting Final Factory Inspection Negotiations: Bao Huaguo's Mission to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Regarding the factory inspection in Shanghai, the concessions are intentionally delaying it. Li Pingheng, director of the Labor Department of the Ministry of Industry, said that the ministry, by virtue of its authority, has once again sent Bao Huaguo, chief of the Fourth Section of the Labor Department, to Shanghai to assist the municipal government in devising a plan to continue the final negotiations without compromising the principle of sovereignty in order to achieve a satisfactory solution. Otherwise, for the sake of national sovereignty, the ministry will follow the central government's entire factory inspection administrative plan and carry out inspections of concession factories as scheduled. The ministry has not yet received a telegram reporting on the progress of Bao's mission to Shanghai after he was ordered to go to Shanghai the other day.</p>
<h3>Yin Tong Left Shanghai for Nanjing Last Night: To Go North to Take Up Position in the Beining Railway Within Days</h3>
<p>According to the Riri News, Yin Tong, a member of the Beining Railway Reception Committee, came to Nanjing from Beiping on official business and then came to Shanghai from Nanjing with Huang Xuan, a secretary of the Executive Yuan, on the evening of the 21st. His whereabouts were very secretive, and few people knew about it. Yin received a clear order from the Ministry of Railways on the 21st of this month, appointing him as the director of the Beining Railway Bureau and urgently needing to go north to take up his new position. He returned to Nanjing last night and plans to go north from Nanjing to take up his post within days. A reporter from the Riri News, in order to understand the inside story of Yin's mission to the south, which was rumored to have the mission of opening a new chapter in Sino-Japanese diplomacy in North China, visited Yin at the station last night and asked about his mission to the south. According to Yin, his</p>
<h3>Mission to the South</h3>
<p>was absolutely unrelated to diplomacy. It was to report to the Ministry of Railways on the situation of the Beining Railway's reception. The Japanese occupied the Lutai area inside the pass when the Sino-Japanese war was tense. The section from Lutai to Tangshan and Qinhuangdao is the most important part of the entire Beining Railway line, with daily revenue of about 30,000 yuan. After strict negotiations, it was finally recovered. Therefore, the Beining train has now reached Shanhaiguan, but the station issue is still being negotiated because it is half inside the pass and half outside the pass. The "Fengshan Railway" occupied by the Japanese and their puppets is originally a section of the Beining Railway outside the pass. The Japanese and their puppets previously requested to open the railway, but our side refused. If traffic is the principle and the Beining Railway comes forward to start traffic, it would not be impossible, but the Japanese and their puppets did not agree, so it was shelved.</p>
<h3>The Military and Political Situation in North China</h3>
<p>is becoming more stable due to the proper arrangement by He Yingqin, the Chairman of the Military Council, and Chairman Huang of the Political Affairs Committee. The counties in eastern Luan are also being reorganized. As for the Japanese ambassador Ariyoshi's trip to the north, it is to handle embassy affairs because the embassy is in Beiping. Direct Sino-Japanese negotiations are not yet possible. When asked by the Riri News reporter when Yin would go north to take up his new position as the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, he said that after he arrived in Nanjing and finished handling unfinished matters, he would be able to go north to take up his post within days.</p>
<h3>Yin Rugeng to Return North Within Days: Visited Tang Waiji Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The newly appointed administrative inspector of the Jidong District of Hebei Province, Yin Rugeng, has been staying in Shanghai recently to take care of personal matters. At 10:00 yesterday morning, Yin drove to visit the Foreign Vice-Minister You Ren, where he discussed the issue of receiving the North China war zone. According to Yin, he will return north within days to prepare for the establishment of the Administrative Inspector's Office of the Jidong District.</p>
<h3>Moore Succeeds as British Assessor in China</h3>
<p>According to a London dispatch from the Zilin Bao on the 21st, it was reported that after Sir Grain, the British Assessor in China, retired, his vacant position has been assigned to the current Royal Prosecutor in China, Moore. This appointment will take effect on December 21. Moore joined the Bar Association in 1908 and practiced law in Shanghai for several years. In 1915, he served as the acting Royal Prosecutor of Weihaiwei, and the following year he was formally appointed, but he also acted as the Royal Prosecutor in China several times in the same year. He then served as acting Royal Prosecutor several times until 1925, when the previous Royal Prosecutor in China, Wilkinson, retired, and Moore succeeded him until now.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Communications' Inspection Commissioner Left Shanghai Yesterday to Return to Nanjing to Report: The Accounting of the Bureau of Navigation Has Been Completed; Agencies Under the Provinces Will Also Be Investigated</h3>
<p>According to the Riri News, the Ministry of Communications recently sent Lu Rongguang, the head of the accounting section, Huang Renhao, the section chief of the general office, and Zhu Yaoting, the current director of the Shanghai Bureau of Navigation, to investigate the accounting of the Shanghai Bureau of Navigation. After arriving in Shanghai, Commissioner Huang and Lu immediately began the investigation. Now, after a week, all procedures have been fully completed and a report has been prepared. Commissioner Huang and Lu took it and returned to Nanjing yesterday to report on their mission. The Ministry will announce it in the future so that the outside world can understand the truth. Moreover, the Ministry of Communications sent people to Shanghai this time, and there were rumors from the outside world. However, according to the Riri News reporter's investigation, the rumors from the outside world are purely fabricated. In fact, the Ministry's move was not aimed specifically at the Shanghai Bureau of Navigation. Because the agencies under the Ministry of Communications in the provinces often have chaotic accounting behaviors, especially with regard to income, expenditure, profits, and losses, and there are many conflicts with the Ministry's regulations. As the 21st year is about to begin, it is urgent to understand the accounting matters of the agencies and seek unification. Therefore, Commissioners were specially sent to the agencies in the provinces to start the investigation. Yesterday, the Ministry also sent Zhang Jinpeng and Wan Yiyi to Hubei to investigate the Hankou Bureau of Navigation. After completing the investigation, they will continue to investigate the telegraph and telephone bureaus.</p>
<h3>Continued News of the Pilot Licensing Dispute</h3>
<p>Pilots are commonly known as "leading the harbor" or "leading the river." Their work is extremely important to national defense. Because the Qing government was昏庸and did not know to重视it, the Chinese government went along and let it go. Since the commencement of trade,太阿倒持, and 门户洞开. During the January 28th Incident of the previous year, the Shanghai War, enemy warships were rampaging on the river. Although the 19th Route Army was heroic, it suffered a惨败. Tracing the reasons, it is worthy of great grief. Aware of this, the Ministry of the Navy vigorously sought to save the situation. In addition to establishing a pilot training institute to train personnel, in January of this year, it promulgated the "Regulations for Pilots in the Songjiang-Hankou Area," ordering pilots to organize an association and stipulating that those who did not join the association would not be allowed to carry out business and re-issue pilot licenses. All ships employing pilots without reading documents would not be allowed to leave the port. The intention was to unite pilots to manage pilot affairs and recover sovereignty. This method is admirable and beautiful. However, pilots are of varying levels and have been allowed to do as they please in the past. Once there is restraint, they will naturally feel inconvenienced in their individual circumstances. For this reason, since the establishment of the Pilot Association, disputes have repeatedly occurred internally and externally, which is due to the fact that the society and the pilots generally do not understand the contents of the document. Recently, the association reported to the Navy Ministry for punishment because seven short-term pilot members, including Fan Gengliang, had violated the rules. Fan and others submitted a reply to the Ministry. The following is a copy of the Navy Ministry's reply: The original petitioners, Fan Gengliang et al., submitted a document stating that they were dissatisfied with the Pilot Association of Songjiang-Hankou's punishment, filed a reply, and requested dismissal. Having presented the document, it has been investigated that pilotage is a publicly operated business, which is related to international treaties and is connected to national defense. A pilot association should be established so that the government can supervise it. The Pilot Association of Songjiang-Hankou has been ordered to be established, issue practicing certificates, and clearly define the pilotage rates, which are the same as the Shanghai port pilotage regulations. It is hoped that the country will follow a policy of recovering its sovereignty. Chinese citizens who serve as pilots should be able to understand this. Pilots in all countries, East and West, are usually guided by the port authorities and carry out pilotage regulations on their behalf. In times of war, they are ordered by military organs to direct pilotage tasks. This is not a matter of other public businesses, limited to personal arts, and not involving national defense treaties. The Songjiang-Hankou Pilotage Regulations clearly stipulate that those who do not join the association may not be pilots. Therefore, once the association's charter is legally agreed upon, it should be followed jointly. In accordance with the provisions of Articles 10, 12, and 16, the association is responsible for all pilots' actions. Privately-operated pilotage businesses arbitrarily set rates, which is clearly a disturbance to the port regulations. The authorities cannot check the ships that go deep into the interior, and there are also problems with the defense of the river. Now that practicing certificates have been issued, it has the responsibility to supervise internally and externally. In terms of the shipping industry, if ships employ pilots who are irresponsible, then it will be called pilotage, but in reality, the pilots are crew members. If there is a ship accident, there will also be problems with water insurance compensation. The association accused pilot Fan Gengliang and others of violating the rules, causing the association to be unable to check and unable to act as the government's eyes and ears, and it is reasonable to submit them for punishment. The association's charter is an internal business matter of the pilot group. The Pilot Training Institute stated that it was a document passed by the association in accordance with the Pilotage Regulations and submitted to the Ministry for record, which was approved. If the payment of pilotage fees to the association, the joint dispatch of aircraft, etc., are not applicable, reasons should be put forward for amendment at the association meeting in order to comply with the procedure. This time, the Pilot Training Institute maintained the association's case requesting punishment. The Ministry approved it on September 27. Now that the pilots have requested a review within the time limit, it should be accepted. What exactly are the facts stated in the reply, and are there any other circumstances? In addition to returning it to the Pilot Training Institute for further review and reply, pilots Fan Gengliang et al. are ordered to report to the institute within five days of receiving this document to await interrogation. This is the approval.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Enthusiastically Supports National Roads: Serves as the Captain of the Shanghai Team of the Road Association</h3>

<h3>News of the Red Swastika Society Handling Emergency Relief for the Yellow River Disaster</h3>
<p>The Red Swastika Society previously dispatched a relief team to western Shandong for disaster relief. Now, reports from various relief workers on the handling of emergency relief have been received and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Caoxian Relief Report Respectfully reporting, the relief workers from this office, Shi Xiding, He Xixiang, Shen Huizhi, etc., rushed to the first, third, and second districts of Caoxian in western Shandong to distribute emergency relief, disbursing a total of 17,881 yuan in relief funds, rescuing over 3,000 households and over 10,000 people. Now, relief worker Shen Huizhi and others are still continuing to work in the fourth district of Caoxian, conducting household investigations and distributing relief tickets in places such as Liwang Wangzhuang Huzhuang Mahai, Jianglou, and Nielou. Soon they will go to Zhangzhuang Lisihangzhuang Zhangdian Nainai, Zhangzhuang Liuzhuang Jilaojia Dahonglimiao Xinji, etc., to continue the investigation and distribution. Everywhere they went, they witnessed extreme misery, sleeping in the open and eating in the wind, which is unbearable to describe. The meager relief funds obtained are only enough to patch up thatched huts and buy a little food and clothing to temporarily maintain their lives. In the sixteen villages they visited, totaling over 300 households and over 1,500 people, a total of 321 relief tickets were issued, including 97 first-class tickets, each worth 8 yuan, totaling 776 yuan; 223 second-class tickets, each worth 6 yuan, totaling 1,338 yuan; and one additional ticket worth 5 yuan, for a total of 2,119 yuan in relief funds disbursed. Adding this to the relief funds previously disbursed in the first, second, and third districts, the total will reach 20,000 yuan. The collected 2,820 relief tickets have been handed over to the Caoxian County Government for safekeeping and future reference.</p>
<p>Dingtao Relief Report Respectfully reporting, I went to Dingtao on October 1st to conduct investigations and distribute relief. It happened to be continuous rainy days, and the roads were muddy, which was quite difficult. It was not until the 7th that the 104 villages affected by the flood were investigated. The conditions of the disaster victims varied, so the relief tickets were divided into three grades. Each disaster household was given one ticket, including 17 special tickets, each worth 5 yuan; 327 Dao tickets, each worth 2.6 yuan; and 2,574 Ci tickets, each worth 1.6 yuan. A total of 2,918 relief tickets were issued, worth 5,053.6 yuan. On the 9th and 10th, together with various organizations in the county office, the tickets were redeemed according to household. On the 11th, I went to Chengwu County and stayed in the Third Section. After inquiring about the flooded villages, I found that they were twice as many as in Dingtao. Today, I will first go to the severely affected areas to investigate and distribute relief one by one, and then determine the method later. Zhao Yulin and Guan Suzhan report.</p>
<h3>Henan Lanfeng Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee Sends Letter Requesting Relief for the Stricken Disaster Victims When the Yellow River Broke its Banks It Was the Middle of the Night Numberless People Were Drowned</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Groups Raising Emergency Relief Joint Committee for the Yellow River Flood recently received a letter from the Henan Lanfeng Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, which stated: Respectfully, after investigation, Lanfeng borders the Yellow River and is often affected by floods. The land is covered in sand and salt. Except for the old course of the Yellow River and the remnants of dikes and dams, only two or three tenths of the land can be cultivated. The land is barren and the people are poor, and few households have any savings. In addition, in recent years, the disasters of soldiers, bandits, floods, and droughts have come one after another, and the harvests have been poor. Even in normal times, most households are empty and people are barely surviving. Unexpectedly, on August 11th this autumn, due to rising water in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, two breaches occurred in our territory, each reaching over a hundred zhang. One flowed from the new dike in Matixiang towards Kaocheng, and the other flowed from the new dike in Zhenpu into the old course. The water was over a zhang deep in some places and four or five chi deep in others, turning the second and third districts into a vast swamp, and the first, fourth, and fifth districts were also submerged in a sea of water. All the crops were washed away, and over 2,000 qing of land were inundated, submerging over a hundred villages. In an area of dozens of li, the fields, livestock, clothing, grain, and fodder were all lost. When the water came, the waves were surging, and it was the middle of the night, so there was no time to escape. For a time, the cries of grief were unbearable to hear. Numberless people were drowned. Those who climbed trees or ascended cliffs were fortunate to escape, but they had no homes to return to and no food to eat. They lingered by the riverbank, no less than fifty or sixty thousand people. The sounds of weeping were heard every day from children and old people, and the faces of old women and weak girls showed signs of hunger. They sought refuge with relatives and friends, but everyone was suffering from the same affliction. They fled in all directions, but the mountains and passes were difficult to cross. They were on the verge of death, like fish stranded in a dried-up rut, crying for food, like stray dogs who had lost their homes. Moreover, the autumn wind was already cool, and they were still living in the grass and sleeping in the open. Although the water has receded, the fertile fields have become barren, and the soil and sand are several chi deep, making it difficult to grow anything in the future. This great disaster will have lasting effects. Anyone who sees this scene will be heartbroken, and anyone who hears about it will feel sorrow. If no measures are taken to rescue the disaster victims, they will have no clothing and no food, and they will either die from the water or from hunger and cold. The Yellow River breach caused unusually severe disaster conditions. We are accordingly sending this letter, along with six photos of the disaster situation, to your association, requesting that you investigate and allocate a large sum of money to rescue the disaster victims and save the lives of the people. This is a matter of public duty. To the Shanghai Yellow River Flood Emergency Relief Joint Committee, from the Henan Lanfeng Yellow River Flood Relief Committee.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warship Tenryū Leaves Shanghai Yamamoto Returns to Japan Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Nichi Nichi Shimbun reported that the warship Tenryū, which had been sailing to Hankou, returned to Shanghai the night before last. The ship has now completely completed its duty of guarding and is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 11:00 AM tomorrow (the 23rd). The Tenryū has been appearing and disappearing in the Yangtze River area for nearly two years since the Shanghai Incident. This time, it will first sail back to the Wu Naval Port and then to the Lushun Fortress for guard duty. It is also said that Inspector-General Yamamoto will return to Japan tomorrow to report on his mission.</p>
<h3>Tariff Law Submitted to the Legislative Yuan for Review Implementation Pending Passage</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency learned yesterday from customs officials that the draft tariff law had long been drafted by the National Fixed Tariff Rate Committee and submitted to Finance Minister Song for review. It is said that Song has now forwarded the full text of the draft to the Legislative Yuan for review, and after it is discussed and passed, it will be submitted to the National Government for promulgation and implementation.</p>
<h3>Cotton Industry Improves Cotton Planting Trials in the Yangsi Area Yield Good Results Expansion Planned</h3>
<p>Cotton is the main agricultural product of this city, but rural farmers stick to old methods and do not make improvements, resulting in poor production and low quality. In view of this, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has been increasing the number of agricultural cooperation trial areas in recent years, and the harvests of various agricultural products have been quite successful. Recently, cotton industry magnates such as Chen Zixin have imitated this method in the Yangsi area of Pudong. They made special agreements with farmers, provided high-quality cotton seeds, hired cotton industry technicians to provide guidance at any time, and subsidized cultivation costs, stipulating three yuan per mu. The farmers were very willing to comply, so the results were quite remarkable. According to reports from farmers in the area, since using the new method of cultivation, the harvest has increased by about one to two times compared to previous years. Chen Zixin and others plan to expand the program next year and are currently preparing an expansion plan. They also plan to organize a cotton planting production and consumption cooperative in Pudong to facilitate the improvement of the cotton industry in this area.</p>

<h3>Jardine Matheson Comprador Dispute The Xi Family is Accused of Breach of Contract Wang Huaisan and Xi Zhengfu Were Originally Partners Gong Ziyu Took Over the Position and Believes There Was a Breach of Contract All Eight Defendants are Named Xi</h3>
<p>The position of comprador for HSBC Bank has been held the longest by the Xi family of Dongting. From Xi Zhengfu to Xi Ligong to Xi Lusheng, it has been passed down for three generations, resembling a hereditary position. If there had been no infighting among the Xi family clan after Xi Lusheng was kidnapped and killed by bandits some years ago, Gong Ziyu would not have succeeded to the position. Upon investigation, British merchants established HSBC Bank in Shanghai as far back as the Tongzhi era of the late Qing Dynasty. The Chinese manager (i.e., comprador) appointed was not initially from the Xi family, but was actually Wang Huaisan from Yuyao, Zhejiang. Wang began his duties in the thirteenth year of Tongzhi and continued until he was old. Feeling that the business was becoming increasingly busy, he consulted with the bank's shareholders and invited Xi Zhengfu to partner with him in taking on the position. The required guarantee deposit was 20,000 taels, with Wang responsible for 20,000 taels. A partnership agreement was signed, stipulating that Xi would handle all business matters. After Wang passed away, Xi took over the position, which was passed down through the generations. Until Lusheng's death, no one knew that a Wang had a share in the position. Recently, Wang Huaisan's daughter-in-law, Wang Hu, (67 years old) came to Shanghai from her original home in Yuyao and hired lawyer Hu Jue to sue Xi Juxing and others, descendants of Xi Zhifu. Thus, the old story was brought up again. The plaintiff Wang Hu accused eight defendants, all named Xi. Other than the eighth defendant, who is Xi Lusheng's wife and therefore a woman, the rest are men. Their occupations and addresses are as follows: The first defendant, Xi Juxing, works in the financial industry; the second defendant, Xi Boyu, has an unknown occupation; the third defendant, Xi Mingjiu, is a bill broker; the fourth defendant, Xi Shuwen, is currently the Assistant Manager of the Huadong Bank; the fifth defendant, Xi Jiming, is currently the Manager of the Huifeng Money Shop; the sixth defendant, Xi Jianxi, was formerly the Director of the Foreign Exchange Bureau of the Central Bank; and the seventh defendant, Xi Debing, was formerly the Superintendent of the Jianghan Customs. The first, sixth, and seventh defendants reside at 1131 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession; the second, third, fourth, and fifth defendants reside at 3 Lane 592, Boone Road, in the British Concession. Xi Lusheng's wife also resides at the end of Qingxiang Lane, Route Cardinal Foch, in the French Concession. The eight defendants reside in both the British and French Concessions, but for the convenience of the lawsuit proceedings, the case was filed in the Second Special District Court. The accusation is that there was a breach of the partnership agreement, stating that the defendants did not request the plaintiff to terminate the agreement, but suddenly transferred the partnership business to Gong Ziyu. The plaintiff did not agree to this act, so how could they transfer the rights and obligations? This is clearly a breach of contract. Moreover, the plaintiff's late father-in-law paid 20,000 taels for the HSBC deposit, and the defendants have not handed over and settled the profits that should have been earned over the years. They requested that the defendants be summoned to court as soon as possible and ordered to hand over all partnership account books for settlement. On the 17th of this month, Judge Rao of the court opened a hearing. The defendants hired lawyers such as Wu Linkun to defend them, raising the issue of the statute of limitations for the contract. They debated with lawyer Hu for a long time. As a result, Judge Rao ordered that the hearing be adjourned to the morning of the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants are Very Active Economic Invasion of China A Department Store Has Been Completed</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Nichi Nichi Shimbun reported that the Shiye Department Store, which is undergoing reorganization and is being built at the corner of Wusong Road and Haining Road, is expected to be completed around November 10th. Suzuki Kōzō, the manager of the store, visited major cities in Kyushu, Kansai, and Kanto in Japan some time ago to inspect department store management methods and reportedly learned new management secrets. He is currently busy with preparations. In addition to the general merchandise market on the ground floor, the second floor will be a cafeteria. The existing store (at the corner of Wusong Road and Bazilu) will collect specialty products from all over China and be converted into a "Chinese Products Museum."</p>
<h3>Apartment Industry in the French Concession Opposes the Municipal Council's Donation and License Regulations Asks the Taxpayers' Association to Negotiate for Cancellation</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council promulgated the new apartment donation and license regulations, all apartments in the French Concession believe that various countries also have distinctions between inns and apartments. Why should apartments in the Shanghai French Concession be taxed and licensed in the same way as hotels? After representatives of various apartments were convened to hold a meeting and discuss the matter, they reported to the Shanghai Apartment Association, which appointed representatives to petition the Municipal Council, requesting that the order be withdrawn. The Municipal Council's General Manager Fuller rejected the request, saying that it must be handled according to the new regulations. All the apartments were greatly alarmed and have convened a meeting, deciding to jointly stamp a letter in the name of all the apartments in the French Concession and send it to the directors of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, requesting that they negotiate with the French Municipal Council to allow the withdrawal of the order. They will also attach photographs of the donation certificates issued by the French Municipal Council in 1931 for the Chinese Directors of the Taxpayers' Association to review, and they will request quick negotiations to maintain the operation of the apartments.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation Sends Letter to the Public Works Department Requesting a Delay in the Construction of the Huishan New Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession yesterday, which stated: Respectfully, according to a letter from the 30th District Branch of our association, the Huashou Lane Tenants' Association of Huate Road and Zhoushan Road stated that the landlord of the lane's buildings traded a base of 3 mu, 4 fen, 2 li, and 1 hao of land with the Public Concession Public Works Department's Huishan Small Vegetable Market base of 2 mu and 2 li and 1 hao of land, receiving a compensation of 32,000 taels for the Public Works Department to use for the construction of the small vegetable market. This has affected tenants whose houses are only eleven years old, who are being forced to relocate and have suffered serious losses in the January 28th Incident, and are now facing the danger of water being cut off three times. They requested assistance, etc., and the matter was brought to the association. After investigation, the tenants in the area suffered losses in the January 28th War. Your department should be sympathetic. In the view of our association, at a time when both public and private finances are tight, and the existing Huishan Vegetable Market is still sufficient, it seems that the construction of a new market can be temporarily delayed, which can save public funds and relieve the hardship. Moreover, it is better to exchange a nearby location for a distant location, paying a large sum of money. It is also an act of losing more than one gains. Furthermore, based on past examples where land has been requisitioned for public use, the original tenants have been evicted, and construction has been delayed for several years without starting, such actions should not be repeated now, adding to the burden of the citizens. In view of the situation described in the letter, we are sending this letter requesting that you investigate and provide relief, which would be a public service.</p>
<h3>The Contents of the Qiangwei Garden New Village Beautiful Environment Convenient Transportation Complete Facilities Transparent Costs</h3>
<p>The China New Village Construction Society recently built the Qiangwei Garden New Village in western Shanghai, and the details have been reported in this newspaper. This kind of undertaking directly solves the housing problem for the masses and is indirectly related to social improvement. The reporter visited Zhang Yongnian and Kong Zizhen of the society, who told them that the first step in building a new village is to choose a location with a good environment: (1) It must be away from the city and not contaminated by the city's bad habits; (2) It should not be too far away from the city, so as not to affect the residents' work; (3) The land price must not be too high; (4) The location must be safe. Therefore, the Qiangwei Garden New Village is located in the suburbs, in Xijiatang, Ningguo Township, Shanghai County, next to the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, with smooth traffic. The village also has public buses to and from Nanjing Road and the Bund, which can be reached in about half an hour. The entire village covers an area of 100 mu, with only 50 houses built. The rest is used for public places, such as a civic hall, kindergarten, elementary school, children's playground, health center, ball field, and market. The expenses are all deposited in the bank according to the plan and will be announced in the newspaper after completion. The houses are divided into three types: A, B, and C. Type A includes a base of one mu and facilities such as flowers, trees, and grassland, costing 9,000 yuan in total. Types A and B are priced slightly higher. The prices are all based on cost, and the cost is absolutely transparent. Each type of house has several designs available for people to choose from, and the cost can be paid in installments to make it easier for people who do not have their own homes to purchase. Nearly two-thirds of the houses have been booked recently. Then, Zhang and Kong guided the reporter to the new village. The car departed from the society's office at 20 Bowuyuan Road and arrived in about half an hour, which is no different from traveling from Yuyuan Road and Daxi Road to Nanjing Road. After passing Jinyi Bridge, the scenery was quiet and beautiful, with green trees and clear streams, and smoke rising from the rooftops. Immersed in nature, it is truly a perfect place to build a new village.</p>
<h3>The Haikingberg Circus Treats Orphans to the Theater</h3>
<p>There are hundreds of unfortunate orphans from various countries in one corner of Shanghai. Mr. Haikingberg, with a kind heart, plans to invite the local orphaned children to visit the theater in the next few days. The first performance will be held on Thursday, inviting 75 children with comfortable seats. Among these 75 children, there are orphans of British, American, Chinese, and Russian nationalities from a local orphanage. Initially, a British employee of a large shipping company went to negotiate with Mr. Haikingberg to purchase tickets at a reduced price, so that these orphaned children could also enjoy a feast for the eyes. Mr. Haikingberg generously agreed to waive the tickets for all of them. As a result, other orphanages have also come to contact him, and the number has reached several hundred. Mr. Haikingberg also plans to send the clown from the troupe to perform tricks at various hospitals and orphanages to entertain the unfortunate patients and orphans.</p>
<h3>Police Station Encourages the Use of Police Whistles to Report Crimes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a shop assistant was able to restrain a gang of thieves by following the police notice encouraging the use of police whistles. Several people entered his shop and showed their guns, forbidding him from making a sound. It is said that he immediately shouted "Robbers!" and his wife, who was upstairs, heard her husband shout and immediately blew the police whistle. The bandits then fled immediately.</p>
<h3>The Great Shanghai Construction Movement Closed Yesterday Wang Xiaolai and Lin Kanghou Spoke at the Meeting</h3>
<p>The Great Shanghai Construction Movement, sponsored by the YMCA, was the last day yesterday. From 10:00 AM to 9:00 PM, the number of people visiting the exhibition was even greater than the previous two days. At 1:30 PM, the association hired several special cars to send visitors to the city center for sightseeing. At 5:30 PM, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commercial Associations, and Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, were specially invited to speak at the meeting. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech Yang Shu, Executive Secretary of the Association, gave a speech, saying that today is the last day of the Great Shanghai Construction Movement. The association should have kept this meeting going until Great Shanghai was realized, but because there are other tasks, it has to come to an end for the time being. He believed that the citizens of the city will definitely work hard to realize Great Shanghai, regardless of whether the association has a movement or not. The speakers invited in the previous two days were from the municipal government, and today, they invited two gentlemen, Wang Xiaolai and Lin Kanghou, the leaders representing the citizens, to speak here.</p>
<p>Lin's Speech Next, Lin Kanghou gave a speech, saying that the municipal government has such a complete and meaningful Great Shanghai construction plan, and we, as citizens, should sincerely support its realization. However, from the standpoint of a citizen, I cannot help but express my hope in three major points: (1) The problem of defending public security. It goes without saying that our country urgently needs various constructions, but if there is no military force to defend public security, people will be hesitant to move forward. Therefore, the Japanese barracks are not to be feared, and the battleships on the Huangpu River are not to be feared. The most important thing is that our country has the ability to resist. (2) The problem of political security. The bad habits of our country's officialdom are that people move with events. However, although Shanghai has repeatedly changed mayors, the changes in various bureaus are still small, especially the public works talents have not been easily changed, so there are these construction achievements. I hope that in the future, it will not fluctuate with political tides. (3) The problem of economic security. To prosper the market, the economy must be the first priority. Today, the market is in great disarray, and the people's purchasing power is weak, which is really worrying. In the future, if we want to realize the Great Shanghai plan, we must first seek economic security. If these three are secure, then the prosperity of Great Shanghai can be predicted. As for the city center, today there is only an isolated municipal government. I believe that all customs offices, post offices, and other important agencies should be moved there. Those who advocate it, such as local officials, should first go to live there to set an example for the citizens, and within a few years, we will not have to worry about the underdevelopment of the city center.</p>
<p>Wang's Speech Finally, Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, saying that there are two major buildings in Ba Xian Qiao, one is the Great World and the other is the YMCA, facing each other, like a pair of large candles in the French Concession. Although both of these pairs of large candles are for the people, they inevitably have a bit of a barbaric taste due to their location. This kind of barbaric taste is really not in line with hygiene. For the sake of hygiene, we should quickly avoid it. As for the term "Great Shanghai," some people find it strange and think that Shanghai is not big enough. Why is the municipal government promoting Great Shanghai again? However, they do not know that the current "great" is someone else's great, not our own great. So everyone must hurry up and work hard to realize our own great. After 7:30 PM, the Jingzhi Troupe performed a play about the meaning of Great Shanghai, and the audience was even more enthusiastic than the previous day. The exhibition closed at 9:00 PM. It is heard that the association will hold an aviation exhibition soon, and all the preparations have been completed.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Memorial Service for Wang Xinguan from All Circles, Publicly Conferring the Posthumous Title</h3>
<p>— "Master Tonghui"</p>
<p>The passing of Mr. Wang Xinguan of Zhenhai has deeply grieved all circles in Shanghai. Organizations such as the Shanghai Banking Association, the Ningbo Association, the Zhenhai Association, the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, and the Siming Bank, held a memorial service at the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association on Xizang Road at 2 p.m. yesterday. The somber atmosphere with plain carriages and white horses showed the utmost respect and honor. The assembly passed a resolution to publicly confer the posthumous title of "Master Tonghui." The details of the meeting are recorded below.</p>
<p>Hall Arrangement: A white cloth banner reading "Memorial Service for Mr. Wang Xinguan" hung high outside the hall. Inside, on the stage, a decorative pavilion was set up, housing a portrait of Mr. Wang. On the table were incense, flowers, plain fruits, and tall white candles burning, with incense smoke lingering. Dozens of wreaths from various sectors were placed below the stage. Scores of bamboo branches adorned with white flowers surrounded the area, creating an extremely sorrowful atmosphere. Inside and outside the hall, elegiac couplets and other condolences were displayed everywhere, numbering no less than a thousand.</p>
<p>Attendees: Those who attended yesterday included Fu Xiao'an, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Shiying, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Xu Shengchan, Yu Zuoting, Sun Hengfu, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Zhu Zikui, Fu Pinggui, Li Shuxiong, Xie Guangfu, Xie Boxu, Wu Zhihao, Xie Hengchuang, Zhu Huanwen, Zhu Meitian, Lu Shaotang, and others, totaling over a thousand people.</p>
<p>Order of Proceedings: (1) Play dirge music; (2) Publicly elect a chairman; (3) Chairman delivers opening remarks; (4) Observe a moment of silence; (5) Chairman presents flowers; (6) Entire assembly bows to the portrait; (7) Read the memorial oration; (8) Sing a funeral song; (9) Report on his life and deeds; (10) Speeches; (11) Family expresses gratitude; (12) Photograph; (13) Play dirge music; (14) Service concludes.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address: After the music played and the meeting began, Yu Qiaqing was publicly elected as chairman. The chairman's address roughly stated that Mr. Wang was a brilliant young man with outstanding talents, helping the poor and assisting those in need, and was enthusiastic about public welfare. He had long been admired by people in society. Unfortunately, his physical constitution was weak, and Heaven did not grant him many years. His passing is deeply mourned by everyone. Mr. Wang treated people with sincerity and dealt with them with harmony. He shared his clothes and food with others, and he was concerned about those who were drowning and hungry. Such a person is hard to find in this world. He devoted his life to developing industry and did not accumulate wealth for personal gain, benefiting society and leaving behind an immortal legacy. We recall the past with unbearable emotions. Today's memorial service is held to express our grief. People in the world leave money for their children and grandchildren, but Mr. Wang left his industry to his descendants. The advantages and disadvantages of this, naturally, cannot be compared on the same day.</p>
<p>Report on His Life and Deeds: Next, Wu Yaqin reported on Mr. Wang's life and deeds, dividing it into three points: family, career, and public welfare. The general idea was that Mr. Wang was intelligent from a young age, and by the age of sixteen or seventeen, he had already shown his mettle in his hometown. He was known far and wide, and he was no ordinary person. Later, he was recognized by Mr. Fu Xiao'an, which allowed him to develop his talents. He was serious in his work, did his best in his duties, was good at maneuvering, had brilliant ideas, generously helped the masses, and made great contributions to society. His filial piety was especially admirable. He left behind six sons, all of whom are gentle and refined scholars, capable of carrying on his legacy. It is comforting to know that good people have descendants.</p>
<p>Excerpts from Speeches: "Xu Shiying" stated in his speech that Mr. Wang's talent was exceptional, and his unfortunate passing was a great loss to the country and society. When the coffin is closed, it is appropriate to honor him. He proposed that the organizations and people from all walks of life present should publicly confer a posthumous title to commemorate him. "Wang Xiaolai" said in his speech that Mr. Wang's body was weak. Five years ago, some people predicted his death. But he did not die five years ago; he died five years later. This not dying is equivalent to longevity. Mr. Wang's immortality came from his struggle, not from enjoying good fortune. The most important thing in life is emotion. With emotion, friends become family; without emotion, family becomes enemies. Mr. Wang was rich in emotion, so his spirit is immortal. "Yuan Ludeng" said in his speech that Mr. Wang was only forty-two years old, so he could not be considered to have lived a long life. The meaning of the memorial service is to look back on the past and to look forward to the future. Mr. Wang came into the world in his teens. If Heaven had granted him more years, his achievements would have been immeasurable. Unfortunately, he passed away suddenly, and the grief is immeasurable. The dead are gone, but we should encourage those who are alive to carry on his legacy, so that this memorial service will not be in vain. "Lin Kanghou" said in his speech that Mr. Wang's spirit was one of struggle and perseverance, and he worked extremely hard in his duties. The prosperity of the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank is due to his contributions. Therefore, in terms of career, he is alive even though he is dead. Compared to those who live in comfort and wealth, his spirit is much longer lived. "Xu Shengchan" said in his speech that during the Northern Expedition fifteen years ago, when Wuhan had not yet fallen, the army was stationed on the border between Hubei and Jiangxi, and supplies to the front lines were extremely difficult. Mr. Wang was entrusted by him to find a way to remit millions of dollars to the army. At that time, under the power of the warlords, this task was extremely difficult. But Mr. Wang calmly dealt with it and made great contributions. Later, he made many plans for finance and received a lot of help from him. Therefore, his contribution to the party and the country has its undeniable value. Now that the coffin is closed, we should make an official statement. "Wu Zhihao" said in his speech that the length of a person's life should be judged by their career. If one enjoys a high life but does nothing for the world, it is meaningless. "Fu Xiao'an" elaborated on Mr. Wang's life in his speech, and he promised to discuss and handle all the post-mortem matters with his friends.</p>
<p>Public Conferment of the Posthumous Title: After the speeches, Xu Shiying proposed to publicly confer the posthumous title of "Master Tonghui," and the whole assembly applauded in agreement. Finally, the family expressed their gratitude, and the meeting adjourned after taking a group photo.</p>
<h3>Mr. Barker Lectures on the British Cotton Industry</h3>
<p>Mr. Barker, a British textile expert, was invited by the China Industrial and Commercial Management Association yesterday to give a lecture on the British cotton textile industry at the United China Association. Those who attended included Li Zhaohuan, Yang Dunfu, Jin Guobao, Pan Yangyao, Shen Jiucheng, Ji Jiannan, Cao Yunxiang, Lao Huimin, Chen Shi, Cheng Shouzhong, and more than forty others. The lecture was translated by Chairman Cao Yunxiang and recorded by Xun's shorthand office. The main points of the lecture are excerpted below: The total world cotton production is 1.4 billion pounds, of which the United States accounts for 58%, and China and the United Kingdom account for 13%. The United Kingdom exports six times more cloth than the United States, and Japan exports three times more than the United States. The reasons why the United Kingdom occupies a superior position are: (1) the United States was formerly a colony of the United Kingdom, and the United Kingdom enjoyed priority in its two cotton-producing regions; (2) the climate in the United Kingdom is humid, which is conducive to the textile industry; (3) the British market is stable, and there are no wars; (4) the workers have technical skills and considerable training; (5) the United Kingdom is a free trade country. However, at present, all countries are advocating self-reliance in developing their own industries. Cotton-producing countries such as the United States, China, and Japan are vigorously expanding their cotton textile industries. As a result, the United Kingdom's superior position is declining. Within the United Kingdom itself, improvements in machinery and scientific management have led to unrest. As for the problem of reducing costs, rationalization, i.e., scientific management, is needed, but it is necessary to take into account: (1) not suppressing individual abilities; (2) taking into account worker training; (3) seeking special development for individuals. If scientific management is used and the above points are ignored, then the harm may outweigh the benefits. Therefore, there are two orientations for the current improvement of the textile industry in the United Kingdom: (1) large-scale rationalization, producing medium-grade goods; (2) specialized small factories, manufacturing the finest fabrics. If the United Kingdom utilizes technological and scientific improvements, it will definitely be able to compete with Japan. Finally, he said that China's textile industry is now working hard to make progress, and the future is promising.</p>
<h3>The Grand Funeral of Madam Lu Zhang</h3>
<p>Yesterday (22nd) was the date of the funeral of Madam Zhang, the first wife of Lu Liankui, the superintendent of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. Important officials of the National Government, county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs from various counties, fellow townsmen associations from various provinces and counties in Shanghai, and prominent figures in Shanghai all sent mourning couplets, "ten thousand people umbrellas," flags, and wreaths, and personally came to pay their respects. The procession was divided into five teams, with seventy plaques, more than eight hundred "rushing flags," more than thirty military bands from the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Government Public Security Bureau, the Municipal Council's Huier Orphanage, and other institutions, more than thirty "ten thousand people umbrellas," and about forty roadside sacrifices from the General Chamber of Commerce and the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association. The fifth team, the Zhang Daishi team, was particularly unique. The instruments were all made of yellow silk, with eight trigrams on them. There were two sedan chairs carrying golden and silver mountains, transported by two trucks, decorated by Sang Dongchen. On each of the mountainsides there was a person wearing a red monk's robe, tying a dragon and a tiger, dressed as capturing the dragon and subduing the tiger. In the caves there were living Arhats totaling eighteen people, with gold-painted faces and wearing red monks' robes with gold thread, dressed as Arhats. The people along the way were amazed by the continuous drumming and percussion. (The golden and silver mountain sedan chairs were sent by Shao Ruqing.) The procession was three miles long, with about five thousand people. It set off at one o'clock and did not reach the Ruijin Public Office on Haining Road until eight o'clock in the evening. The crowds along the way were huge. The Red Cross sent ambulances for emergencies, and the Zhabei Fire Brigade sent two fire trucks. Students from engineering schools, boy scouts, the entire Chinese detective force of the General Patrol Room, and Chinese and Western patrol officers all joined in carrying the ropes. Four groups of photographers were dispatched to take photos along the way. Shao Ruxin, the chief director of the funeral committee, supervised the directors of the various departments and prepared day and night, which was quite arduous.</p>
<h3>The Xin Renhe Steamer Organizes an Escort Team 丨Protecting Passengers on Board丨</h3>
<p>The Xin Renhe steamer, which runs between Shanghai and Chongming, has been extremely crowded with passengers and goods since it was leased to the Haiqi Shipping Bureau. The business is booming. Recently, as winter has arrived, there are more passengers coming and going than before. In order to protect the safety of passengers, the Bureau has organized an escort team. Every day, more than a dozen armed soldiers are dispatched on board to protect passengers along the way, so that the luggage and goods carried by passengers will not be stolen or damaged. Therefore, in recent days, passengers traveling between Shanghai, Chongming, and Haiqi have been happy to take the steamer.</p>
<h3>Ji Guo Punished for Performing Abortion for One Year</h3>
<p>Zhu Aiqiao, a woman from Hangzhou residing at No. 63 Ren Shou Lane, Pekaier Road, is 20 years old. She used to work as a female worker at the Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory in Chunyang Lane on the same road. Recently, she was seduced by Xu Wenyao, an employee of the factory, and had a physical relationship. She became pregnant for three months. Fearing that her sister Zhu Zhengyuan would find out, she asked Ji Guo, a woman from Jiangbei, to perform an abortion secretly at the home of Jin Xiaomei, her neighbor at No. 51, on the 2nd of this month. Later, Zhu became ill and was treated at Guangren Hospital. Zhang Degong, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Patrol Station, found out about it and arrested Xu Wenyao without success. He arrested Zhu and Ji Guo and took them to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The day before yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiebin presided over the third criminal court for further interrogation. The doctor at Guangren Hospital said that there were still fetal objects in Zhu's abdomen. The forensic doctor had already verified that there was no sign of twins. Ji Guo's testimony was evasive and asked for leniency. Judge Xiao sentenced Zhu Aiqiao to a fine of 50 yuan, with a two-year suspended sentence. Ji Guo was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the judgment is confirmed will be offset against one day of imprisonment for every two days. The two roots of abortion herbs were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Hu Xiyuan Will Go to Wuhan to Attend the National Electrical Industry Conference</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Private Electrical Industries will hold its fifth general membership meeting in Wuhan on the 31st of this month. Electrical industry leaders and electrical experts from all over the country are invited to gather together to discuss matters related to improving the electrical industry. Both the China Yaopu'er Electric Appliance Factory and its general manager Hu Xiyuan received invitations from the Federation of Private Electrical Industries to attend the meeting. Hu Xiyuan of the Yaopu'er Factory believes that the matter concerns the national electrical industry and is of great importance, and he plans to attend in person to discuss everything. It is said that he is scheduled to leave for Wuhan on the 25th.</p>
<h3>Fire at Xiaodongmen</h3>
<p>Pan A'da, a native of Wuxi, runs the Lao Pumanxing Iron Shop at No. 43 Xiaodongmen, Zhonghua Road. His business has been quite prosperous in recent years. At around 10 o'clock yesterday morning, the shop accidentally caught fire. In an instant, fierce flames soared and pierced the roof. When the fire brigades from various districts heard about it, they immediately drove pump trucks to the scene to draw water to put out the fire. The fire was extinguished after about half an hour. In addition to burning down one room on the second floor of the shop, the second floor of the Yang Wanxing Iron Shop at No. 41 on the left was also affected and burned down at the same time. When the fire was raging, the police from the First Zone and Second Precinct rushed to the scene to maintain order after hearing the alarm. They also took Pan's mother, Pan Zhang, to the station. After preliminary questioning by Director Liu, the case concerned a fire, and he immediately ordered a written report to be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>The Process of Resolving the Wage Increase Issue for Yihe Stevedores 丨The Union's Negotiations Are Successful 丨All Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>The stevedores on the Jianghai routes of the British Yihe Company went on strike on the 20th to urge the company to come to its senses because their demands for a wage increase had not been met for a long time. At that time, the situation was extremely tense. Fortunately, the union's negotiations were effective, and a resolution was reached within a few hours. The storm did not spread. The company accepted all three conditions proposed by the stevedores at 5 p.m. that afternoon. Therefore, the stevedores obeyed the union's order and announced their resumption of work yesterday morning. The details of the process are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Three Conditions</h3>
<p>The treatment received by the stevedores of Yihe's various ships is inferior to that of any other company, and they cannot maintain their livelihoods. The stevedores convened representatives from various ships and decided on three conditions to improve their situation: (1) Every stevedore will receive an additional six yuan per month starting from October of this year; (2) In the event of a shipwreck, in addition to handling the matter in accordance with maritime law, if the annual salary is less than 650 yuan, the compensation shall not be less than 650 yuan. Survivors shall be compensated 160 yuan for losses, and their jobs shall be given priority; (3) The annual double salary will be abolished and replaced with three days of work promotion per month.</p>
<h3>Union Negotiation</h3>
<p>The stevedores believed that the company had not made any statement for a long time, which showed that it had no sincerity. Therefore, they resolutely took strike action the day before yesterday. At the same time, Wang Zhengfu, a standing committee member of the Stevedores Club, led all the stevedores to petition the Preparatory Committee of the China Seamen's Union and the Seamen's Special Party Branch. The Seamen's Union was received by Secretary Hou Dachun. In addition to urging all stevedores to strictly observe order and not take any actions outside the rules, it also ordered the Shanghai Branch to investigate and send Secretary Sun Luping to negotiate with the company. That afternoon, he met with Mr. Tod, the chief manager of the company, and Pan Zhiquan, the general comprador, and completely accepted the three conditions. Mr. Tod also stated that he was willing to negotiate everything with the union and that no one else could participate in the negotiations. He also scheduled to sign an agreement today. The union will still send Secretary Sun to handle it. The long-pending issue of wage increases has finally been resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<h3>Resumption of Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>The union believed that since the conditions had been accepted, the stevedores should immediately resume work. Therefore, it issued an emergency order that night, ordering the stevedore representatives Lin Shengmao and others that the three conditions proposed by the Yihe stevedores regarding the request for a wage increase had been agreed to and completely accepted by Mr. Tod, the chief manager of the company, and Pan Zhiquan, the general comprador, after Secretary Sun Luping rushed to the company for strict negotiations. For this reason, they were urgently ordered to immediately inform all stevedores to return to work on the ship tomorrow without fail. The order was to be followed without error. After receiving the order, the stevedores cheered. They all boarded the ship and resumed work yesterday morning. The union also sent a cadre, Yin Xuzai, to investigate. All the goods on the Lisheng ship berthed at the Huashun Wharf and the Yuansheng ship berthed at the Shuntai Wharf have been loaded and unloaded.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Cadre School of the Security Department Invited Kang Xuanyi to Give a Lecture on the Disarmament Conference and the Second World War</h3>
<p>According to Xin Xin She, the cadre training school of the Municipal Security Department invited Professor Kang Xuanyi, a standing committee member of the United Association of Staff Members of Various Universities, to give a lecture yesterday on the Disarmament Conference and the Second World War. Those who attended included Li Zhengqiu, Wang Weiming, and Lu Jianhong, the training directors of the department, and more than a hundred cadres, officers, and students. Director Li first gave an introductory speech, followed by Kang's lecture. The general idea was that the ancient saying "stopping the spear is martial; not restraining yourself is self-immolation," as well as Mozi's theory of non-aggression, all contain the meaning of disarmament. The idea of disarmament in Europe was nurtured by Rousseau, Kant, Bentham, and others. In the first and second naval conferences, both the United Kingdom and Germany had disarmament proposals. Although there were subsequent mutual arms talks between the United Kingdom and Germany, they ultimately failed.</p>
<h3>The Havoc of the European War</h3>
<p>Afterwards, the great powers painfully reflected on their experiences. Therefore, Article 8 of the Covenant of the League of Nations stipulated that member states should recognize the reduction of armaments to the extent sufficient to guarantee international and international obligations. A standing armaments committee was established to study and resolve the technical issues of disarmament, and a mixed committee was established to resolve the political issues of disarmament. The Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance in 1923 and the Geneva Protocol in 1924 were not adopted because of British opposition. Later, due to local consultations between the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, the Locarno Treaty was concluded, and the problems of security guarantees and arbitration were adequately resolved. Then, a preparatory disarmament conference was convened. Outside the League of Nations, the U.S. President convened the Geneva Naval Conference to continue the unfinished business of the Washington Conference. The result was failure, and British-American</p>
<h3>Naval Competition</h3>
<p>became increasingly acute. In 1929, the British House of Lords approved the Kellogg-Briand Pact. In the same week, Congress passed a bill to build 150,000 tons of cruisers. After Hoover took office, he worked to end the naval competition between the United Kingdom and the United States. The British Labour Party Prime Minister went to the United States in person. After an understanding of British-American naval equality was reached, the London Five-Power Naval Conference was held and the Five-Power Naval Treaty was signed. The treaty expired in 1935. The Second Naval Disarmament Conference was convened in that year. Germany and Japan</p>
<h3>Withdrew from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>also took effect in that year. The Saar coal region's citizens' election was also held in that year. As a result of Japan's withdrawal from the League, the South Pacific mandated territories were regarded by Japan as a military lifeline and Manchuria as its economic lifeline, having the same importance. They will not be easily abandoned, and they will be contested by other countries. These are all fuses for the Second World War. Therefore, the Japanese man Qiaozhua Mingnan wrote in the "Economic Exchange Magazine" that the most recent 1936 was a major crisis for Japan, urgently calling for attention from his countrymen. The British historian Wells recently wrote an article predicting that in 1935, Japan would once again launch a large-scale invasion of China and create a puppet state in North China. In 1936, Japan would mobilize 20,000 troops to invade all parts of China. In 1937, the Russian Air Force would attack Japan, and there would be a major naval battle between Japan and the United States. In 1938, the Japanese army would retreat home in defeat due to the Blackwater plague, and a revolution would occur in the country. In 1940, the revolutionary climax would spread from India and Persia to all parts of Europe. If Wells' words unfortunately come true, then the comrades of the Security Team, who are responsible for maintaining security in Shanghai, will be on the front lines of the world war. Therefore, they should work hard and prepare to deal with future emergencies in a timely manner.</p>
<h3>Dyeing Workers Refuse to Dye Customer Goods, Social Bureau Sets Interview Today</h3>
<p>The silk and cloth dyeing workers in the city formally refused to dye silk shop original piece customer goods starting yesterday because they opposed the capital side's reduction of wine money. At the same time, for fear that the dyeing workshops would cheat by dyeing customer goods under the name of retail goods, they specially notified all dyeing workshops yesterday that all whole-piece goods must be stamped by the union before being placed in the vat and must be picked up starting on the sixth day (because silk shop original piece goods can usually be picked up on the day they are sent for dyeing). The Social Bureau, fearing that the situation would escalate, specially set today at 1:00 p.m. to summon both parties for questioning. The notice is recorded below: For notification purposes, according to the report, the labor and capital sides are first notified to appoint two responsible representatives to come to the Bureau to listen to the questioning. This is specially notified. October 21st, 22nd year of the Republic of China, Director Wu Xingya. The capital side also sent a letter to the Silk and Cloth Dyeing Office yesterday, saying: Dear Sir, Your office, etc., is for not fulfilling the original agreement conditions for the wine money of the workers and requesting restoration for our industry. You have implemented a go-slow strike starting from today to strictly urge the capital side to come to its senses. We have investigated this matter and found that your office, etc., did not submit a written request beforehand or go through a proper discussion method between labor and capital. You immediately went on strike, which is deeply regrettable. Moreover, the destruction of the wine money was originally due to the silk side deducting the dyeing price and layer-by-layer exploitation, violating the dyeing price conditions signed by the Social Bureau in the 18th year of the Republic of China, causing the capital side to fail to cover costs when settling the dyeing price with the silk side and suffering huge losses, making it impossible to provide the wine money included in the dyeing price, indirectly causing the labor side's reaction. The fundamental solution to this case and the restoration of the wine money must first restore the dyeing price agreement as a prerequisite. The labor and capital sides should take advantage of this opportunity to stand on the principle of mutual benefit and assist in the process to restore the dyeing price agreement as a matter of urgency, strive for a way out, and achieve the goal of co-existence and co-prosperity. If this is not the case, and the capital side, which is on the verge of death, is forced to recognize the restoration of the wine money, it will be even more unsustainable. It is tantamount to mutual destruction. To illustrate, if the wet nurse is sick, the baby's demand for milk will inevitably lead to exhaustion and death together. "If the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to?" This concept is probably shared by all the workers. Now the capital side advocates that the negotiation on the dyeing price agreement, the restoration of the original situation, and the dispute over the restoration of the wine money requested by your office should be resolved at the same time, taking a two-pronged approach so as to reach an appropriate path. This association has convened a representative assembly on the 20th of this month to discuss the "results." In terms of dyeing price, the contract price signed in the original 18th year should be restored, and the wine money can be implemented according to the old agreement. If the dyeing price cannot be restored, under the financial circumstances, the capital side really has difficulty bearing the restoration of the wine money. On the one hand, the silk side must separate the wine money to clearly mark the limit. A letter has been sent to this effect. Correspondingly, this letter is sent for your information, hoping that you will quickly order all workers and staff to take into account the intention of mutual benefit and cooperation between labor and capital, and resume work immediately. You must know that a day of strike will result in a day of business loss and the suffering of life for both labor and capital. Please pay attention and look forward to a reply.</p>
<h3>Distribution of American Cotton and Wheat Should Be Calculated According to New Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>The American cotton and wheat that our country borrowed from the United States have been shipped in batches and distributed for application in various regions. The Ministry of Industries is deeply concerned that the cotton and wheat may be calculated according to the American system of weights and measures during the unloading and distribution process. Therefore, it has specially consulted the Ministry of Finance and instructed its subordinates to be informed. The text states: "Approved Shanghai Municipal Government Consultation No. 1544, based on the report from Shen Hui, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Weights and Measures Instrument Manufacturing Factory, stating the report as a report. It is noted that the unification of weights and measures in this city was announced on July 1, 1931, and the national weights and measures are also scheduled to be unified before the end of this year. The issue of promoting the new system is now urgently in need of government advocacy and supervision to lead the public to actively implement it consistently, in order to maintain the system and achieve the goal of unification. Recently, the cotton and wheat that the National Government ordered from the United States have arrived in our country for distribution and application in domestic factories. However, it is noted that since these cotton and wheat are American goods, their measurement is calculated according to the American system, which is completely incompatible with our country's new system. It is proposed that the Ministry of Industries should use our country's new system as the standard when the goods arrive and are allocated, in order to comply with the Ministry's original intention of promoting the new system and avoid giving people grounds for criticism. When various factories sell their manufactured products, they must also continue to implement the new system, and the official authorities should cooperate in promoting it, so that the completion of the unification of national weights and measures can be expected. This matter is of great importance and cannot be kept silent. Therefore, a special written report is submitted, hoping for your examination and approval and forwarding to the Ministry of Industries for examination and handling, which would be in the public interest." Based on this, it is found that the various points stated are for the sake of complying with the new system of weights and measures. In addition to instructing to forward the consultation according to the situation, a corresponding consultation is sent to you, hoping that you will investigate and handle it, and also request a reply. It is hereby approved that the unification of weights and measures is an important policy of the present time. All government affairs related to weights and measures should comply with the new system to demonstrate unification and promote it. When the cotton and wheat borrowed from the United States arrive in our country and are distributed for application in domestic factories, they should be calculated according to the new system of weights and measures in order to comply with the previous intention. The point requested by the chairman is indeed crucial. The consultation is approved for the aforementioned reason. In addition to replying to the consultation, a corresponding consultation is sent to you, hoping that you will investigate and handle it, and also request a reply.</p>

<h3>Tragedy Strikes at Funeral Procession: Hua Zuolie Injured in Head by Falling Timber</h3>
<p>Hua Zuolie, a 27-year-old man from Ningbo, who worked as a clerk at the Jiande Bank on North Henan Road, was walking with a friend along North Suzhou Road yesterday afternoon at around 2 p.m., when he encountered the funeral procession of the wife of Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the Public Concession Police.

A Chinese police officer, number 29, from the Customs Water Police Station discovered the body and brought it to the police station. Two pawn tickets from Jinchang and Wankang pawnshops were found on the body. It is believed that the person was under economic pressure and committed suicide by throwing himself into the river.

<h3>Cheng Yuanqing Goes Missing</h3>
<p>Cheng Xuezhai from Anhui, a worker at the Sanyuan Tea House at No. 4 Taixing Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, has a son named Yuanqing who also works at the Sanyuan Tea House. He is extremely honest and familiar with the streets of Shanghai. However, on the afternoon of the 6th of this month, he went to the amusement park and never returned. According to his father, his son had no enemies and no money.

<h3>Shanghai Senior Singles Championship Still Belongs to Qiu Feihai 丨Result of Yesterday's Final丨 Straight Three Wins Over Wang Wenzheng 丨Situation Dull and Lacks Excitement丨</h3>
<p>In the Men's Senior Singles Final of the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Association, Qiu Feihai defeated Wang Wenzheng in straight three sets yesterday, retaining the championship. The Women's Doubles Championship was won by Miss Cora Shaw and Mrs. Fischer. The results of the two groups are as follows:</p>
<h3>Women's Doubles Final</h3>
<p>Miss Cora Shaw (6-2) Mrs. Voges</p>
<p>Mrs. Fischer (6-3) Mrs. Klenov</p>
<h3>▲Men's Senior Singles Final</h3>
<p>(7-5)</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai (6-2) Wang Wenzheng</p>
<p>(6-3)</p>
<p>Qiu Wang Battle Situation</p>
<h3>▲Similar Playing Style</h3>
<p>Qiu and Wang are both skilled long-sleeved players from the baseline, consistently steady. Therefore, when they face each other, the similarity in their tactics inevitably reduces the excitement. However, Wang Wenzheng's skill is ultimately somewhat lacking. Consequently, if Wang wants to defeat Qiu, he must find another way. Therefore, it was observed that Wang often went to the net, but due to his unsteady finishing, the number of times the ball hit the net was numerous. Qiu, on the other hand, maintained his usual style, and the outcome was thus decided. In terms of excitement, there wasn't much to see. From Wang Wenzheng's perspective, he has already made significant progress.</p>
<h3>▲Straight Three Wins</h3>
<p>Wang Wenzheng served, and the server won each time until it was four to four. Then, Qiu Feihai broke Wang's serve, making it five to four, and the situation began to unfold. However, Wang retaliated in the same way, making it five to five again. Qiu finally won two more games to win the first set. After this hard-fought set, Wang's endurance significantly decreased, and the situation rapidly deteriorated. After Wang won his serve, Qiu won four games in a row. In the sixth game, Wang won, and Qiu won the second set 6-2. In the final set, they each won a game again and again. After three to three, Qiu won three consecutive games, winning 6-3 and achieving a straight three-set victory.</p>

<h3>Football Stars' Grand Gathering: Hong Kong Borrows Troops to Avenge Shanghai - ▲Result: Two to One, Two to Zero in the First Half - Hong Kong Team Organized Internally and Externally, Dominated the Game - Shanghai Team Strived Together, But Ultimately Failed</h3>
<h3>15,000 People Applaud in Unison</h3>
<p>The Shanghai and Hong Kong football teams, which participated in the National Games, met yesterday at the China Baseball Field. This was one of the most exciting scenes since the beginning of the Shanghai football season. The football field was surrounded by a sea of people, approximately 15,000 in number, creating a lively atmosphere. Hong Kong, in order to avenge their defeat in the National Games, specially borrowed Li Tiansheng, Ye Beihua, and others, who are among the "Four Knights" from the Guangdong team, to join them. Therefore, their lineup was even more solid, and their performance was even more outstanding. Their running was fast, their passing was beautiful, their footwork was sharp and flawless, and their movements were skillful and crisp. The spectators praised them lavishly, admiring them without end. As for the Shanghai team, although they resisted tenaciously, they exposed their weaknesses everywhere. Success or failure is inevitable, and one cannot force it. Who would say that it was inappropriate for the Hong Kong team to win 2-1? However, Zhou Tiemen of the Shanghai team did not play, and Liang Shutang was only brought in during the second half, which was the reason for the Shanghai team's diminished performance.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Holds the Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>Although this match was a friendly one, it was essentially an inter-port match between Shanghai and Hong Kong, so the ceremony was quite grand. Prominent figures and veterans from the sports world were present. Mayor Wu performed the opening kick. (Photo by Qi Chang)</p>
<p>to observe the game. Mayor Wu Tiecheng specially donated a silver cup. Before the start of the match, the silver cup was displayed at the center of the field, its brilliance dazzling, earning much applause. Mayor Wu officiated the opening ceremony. After the match, Mayor Wu personally presented the award and delivered a speech to welcome the attendees, followed by three cheers, and the event dispersed.</p>
<h3>Tense Situation from the Start</h3>
<p>After three chimes, a silver whistle sounded. Both teams lined up in anticipation. Mayor Wu kicked the ball, and the players began to fight fiercely. Zheng Jiliang and Ye Beihua were like light cavalry, galloping quickly, holding their guns and running swiftly. The situation in front of the Shanghai team's goal was tense. The valiant Zhang Fei displayed his imposing presence, blocking the way. Li Yichen commanded his troops to launch raids and assaults, creating a dangerous situation for the Hong Kong team. Li Tiansheng used both falls and tumbles to turn danger into safety. Thus, both sides advanced and retreated, back and forth, for ten minutes, without a clear winner.</p>
<h3>Xu Yahui Scores an Own Goal with His Head</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong team, determined to avenge their defeat, launched a fierce attack. Yang Shuiyi received the ball on the wing and passed it to Zheng Jiliang, who broke through the first line of defense and lightly passed it to the left corner. Ye Beihua shot the ball in front of the goal, and Huang Meishun happened to arrive, kicking it forcefully. Lu Zhongen received the ball perfectly and kicked it out with his foot, accurately hitting Xu Ya's forehead. The ball, possessing elasticity, reflected towards the goal. Lu Zhongen exclaimed "Ah!" as the ball fell into the net. The Hong Kong team gained a goal without effort.</p>
<h3>Ye Beihua Ends the First Half</h3>
<p>After conceding a goal, the Shanghai team gathered together and made an effort to counterattack. Xu Yahui was even more determined, hoping to redeem himself. The Hong Kong goal saw enemy riders gallop about several times. Fortunately, goalkeeper Bao Gang was quick-witted and agile, dealing with the situation calmly and saving many dangerous shots. Unexpectedly, a ball slipped out, and Zheng Jiliang received assistance, swiftly galloping in and charging straight in. He passed the ball to Ye Beihua. Beihua became active immediately. The valiant Zhang Fei could not stop him. He stormed the goal and lightly kicked the ball in. The Hong Kong team scored another goal. By then, forty minutes had passed since the start of the match. The Shanghai team was planning to recover lost ground, but time did not permit it. The first half ended with a score of 2-0.</p>
<h3>Li Yichen Skillfully Kicks a Penalty</h3>
<p>After a lemon break, the players returned to the battlefield. The Shanghai team adopted an offensive strategy, determined to recover lost ground. Chen Jiaqiu exerted great effort. Sun Tuitui kicked a ball on the ground. Goalkeeper Bao Gang, experienced and skilled, dived to catch it, but the ball veered off by three inches to the left of the goal, resulting in a corner kick. Chen Jiaqiu kicked the ball neither too high nor too low, in front of the goal. Yichen headed it, but it landed right in Gang's hands and was saved again. The Shanghai team attacked a second time. Li Shiyou advanced along the side. The ball entered the inner defense line. Liang Rongzhao, in his eagerness to stop him, carelessly fouled him, resulting in a penalty. Li Yichen took the penalty. There was nothing to say. The Shanghai team pulled back a goal.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Team Wins the Mayor's Cup</h3>
<p>From then on, Hong Kong adopted a defensive strategy, while the Shanghai team's counterattack became even fiercer. The later stages were even more exciting. Li Yichen and Sun Jinshun repeatedly missed good opportunities. Moreover, the Hong Kong team's defense was strict, and their goal was difficult to penetrate. After thirty minutes of fierce fighting, no results were seen. Huang Meishun once scored a goal during an attack, but it was ruled offside. In the end, the Hong Kong team defeated the Shanghai team 2-1 and won the Mayor's Cup. Referee Shen Huichun. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>

<h3>Zhang Jiwu Goes to Europe and America to Study Physical Education</h3>
<p>▲Sailing on the 14th of Next Month</p>
<h3>▲Brief Biography of Mr. Zhang</h3>
<p>Zhang Jiwu, styled Jiwu, is currently 42 years old and a native of Tianjin. In the second year of the Xuantong reign of the Qing dynasty, he graduated from the mechanical engineering department of Zhili Provincial Higher Industrial School. In the re-examination by the Ministry of Education, he was ranked first in the highest class and awarded the degree of Juren. After graduation, he stayed at the school to teach physics and English, and also managed extracurricular sports. In the second year of the Republic of China, he transferred to the American Mobil Oil Company in Tianjin, Shanghai, Dalian, etc. as an engineer. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, he was hired by Nankai School to teach physics and English, and also managed extracurricular sports and served as a scout trainer. He served as the president of the Tianjin School Sports Federation and the honorary executive director of the Tianjin Chinese Boy Scouts Federation. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, feeling the urgent need for physical education for the Chinese nation, he went to the Department of Physical Education of National Southeast University to study Chinese physical education problems with Mr. McLure, an American physical education expert. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, he returned to Tianjin Nankai School to serve as the director of physical education for the four departments of Nankai University, middle school, girls' middle school, and elementary school. He served as honorary secretary of the North China Sports Federation, president of the Tianjin Sports Association, director of the Tianjin Public Sports Ground, and member of the YMCA Sports Committee.</p>
<h3>▲Reason for Going Abroad</h3>
<p>I have served in Tianjin Nankai School and the sports world for nearly 20 years. During these 20 years, I have experienced many difficulties in implementing Chinese physical education. I have long wanted to go abroad to study and learn from others. Two years ago, after President Zhang Boling of Nankai returned from the United States, he planned to send me abroad, but due to the unstable situation in North China, the country was in distress, and the school's economy was difficult, it could not be implemented. Recently, I obtained a loan of 5,000 yuan from Hebei Province for studying abroad, as well as the assistance of relatives and friends, raising enough travel expenses to cover two years. Therefore, I decided on a plan to go abroad.</p>
<h3>▲Belief in Physical Education</h3>
<p>In today's difficult problem of saving the country, people all say that it is nothing more than poverty and weakness. But after carefully studying the fundamental problems of China, I have said that it is not in poverty but in weakness. Why do I say this? Just look at the latest statistical survey of China and you will know. The short average age of Chinese citizens, the shockingly high number of deaths from various diseases, as well as weak production capacity, moral depravity, and irregular living habits, etc., are all directly related to physical fitness and health. Therefore, I have always believed that the backwardness of various undertakings in China is entirely because there are not a few healthy and great people emerging now. How great is the danger of the nation! Therefore, the fundamental problem of the Chinese nation is really weakness, poverty is just the result.</p>
<h3>▲Plan for Going Abroad</h3>
<p>The origin of modern physical education started in Greece and Rome, then in Sweden and Germany, and recently developed in the United States. Therefore, this time I plan to go abroad, first to Europe for about a year, and then to the United States for another year, with a limit of two years. In Europe, I will use Berlin, the capital of Germany, as the center, and reside at the Berlin</p>
<p>(Photo of Mr. Zhang Jiwu recently)</p>
<p>Sports University. I will go to other countries to investigate points that should be noted. For example, Italy, since Mussolini of the Fascist Party came to power, has attached great importance to national sports, and plans to implement it concretely. China can learn from this. After the completion of the Soviet Union's five-year plan, there have been many successes. China can also learn from the methods of training young people and how to popularize and democratize sports. Switzerland's military education, Denmark's new gymnastics, Sweden's corrective gymnastics, British amateur sports, and the cultivation of benevolence and chivalry are all knowledge that physical education researchers cannot ignore. As for Germany, after the Great War, ceding land and paying reparations, and restricting armaments, it is everywhere subject to the constraints of treaties, which is not dissimilar to China's situation. However, the spirit of struggle of the German nation and the various methods of incorporating military affairs into sports are admired by me personally and are what our country should learn from most now. Therefore, I am determined to reside in Germany for a long time in Europe and have less contact with Chinese people, so as to absorb its spirit of national struggle. In the second year, I will go to the United States to study its various methods of how to make sports scientific and educational.</p>
<h3>▲Discharge of Personal Domestic Responsibilities</h3>
<p>The greatest responsibilities I bear at home are the position of Director of Physical Education at Nankai School and the presidency of the Tianjin Sports Association. Regarding Nankai School, my trip abroad has been agreed to by President Zhang Boling, who has granted me a leave of absence for two years. The physical education course will not have a director, but will be changed to a committee system, with the Director of Academic Affairs serving as the chairman of the Sports Committee. Other duties will be undertaken separately by the physical education teachers. Nankai's physical education is already on track and has a considerable foundation. After I leave the school, there will be no problems. As for the position of president of the Tianjin Sports Association, after I leave Tianjin, the vice president will temporarily exercise the powers of the office, and there will be no problems either.</p>
<h3>▲Itinerary</h3>
<p>I am scheduled to take an Italian mail ship from Shanghai on November 14th of this year, disembarking at Brindisi, Italy on December 7th, arriving in Naples on the 9th and staying for three days, then going to the Italian capital Rome for about two weeks. Around the 20th, I will visit the newly built sports ground in Florence. On the 22nd, I will go to Geneva, Switzerland, and spend the end of the year at the home of a friend in Essen, Germany. After the New Year in 1934, I will enter the German capital. The mailing address will be forwarded by the Chinese Embassy in Germany.</p>
<h3>London Indoor Tennis Finals: Borotra Defeats Austin, 3-2, Retains Title</h3>

<h3>Rebuilding of the Shanghai North Middle School　▲Construction will begin today to restore the old appearance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai North Middle School on Yongxing Road, Zhabei, was built by the founder and principal, Tang Naikang, in conjunction with Qian Yongming, chairman of the board of directors, and others, in 1918, with huge sums of money raised. The school buildings were grand and majestic, making it the top private middle school in Shanghai. Unfortunately, all the school buildings were burned down during the January 28 Incident, with losses amounting to more than 200,000 yuan. The school compiled a detailed account of the destruction, which recorded the facts in detail, distributed it to all sectors of society, and reported it to the government for record. At the same time, a revival design committee was organized, inviting celebrities from all walks of life to discuss the matter together, and there were signs of progress. The construction funds have also been raised. Now, in order to urgently revive local education and promote the prosperity of the Zhabei market, Principal Tang has decided to rebuild the latest modern school buildings on the original site of Yongxing Road, Zhabei. The drawings have been completed by the Dingzhong Construction Company. It is planned to build a classroom building that can accommodate 600 people, a dormitory building that can accommodate 200 people, a large auditorium that can accommodate 700 people, and other office buildings. All projects are equipped with the latest facilities. The plan has been approved by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, and the Lugenji Construction Factory has been selected as the contractor. Construction is scheduled to begin today, and the cornerstone laying ceremony is scheduled to be held on November 4th, with completion expected within three months.</p>

<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of Medicine in Shanghai in the Last Decade (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: Conclusion</p>
<p>This article has been written successively. Unconsciously, it has exceeded 20,000 words. Although I have added some comments along with the factual records, according to common practice, there should still be an overall explanation. Therefore, I have categorized and summarized the above, and while discussing the matters, I also state the original reasons and add my personal opinions to serve as the conclusion of this article.</p>
<p>(1) The Doctrine: In a nutshell, it is "right and wrong have not been judged." The reason is actually still influenced by thousands of years of culture, and new education is not yet universal. Chinese people still suffer from the problems of sticking to old ways and being ignorant and arrogant. They still hold a hesitant attitude and jealous thoughts towards the strengths of others. They insist that China is an ancient civilized country, and everything has been developed before Westerners. It's like claiming that we invented airplanes after reading the "Romance of the Mirror Flowers," and insisting that machinery is our own after reading the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." So they cling to old books and confront new theories. I remember that in the past, when building railways and setting up telegraphs, many ministers also obstructed them. But what was the result in the end? If you think about it today, I'm afraid you will laugh. In medicine, although many diseases can heal themselves, and many medicines are coincidentally effective, it is difficult to distinguish right from wrong for a while. In fact, not to mention people of thought, who know that old medicine will be eliminated sooner or later, even old doctors themselves know that it is declining day by day, so they are eager to remedy it. It's just a pity that the doctrine cannot be sorted out, and they can only promote business. But only the doctrine can help business, and there is no reason to use business to restrain the doctrine. To overthrow the civil engineering department in the school with a bridge built by a stonemason, it is impossible after all! As for the valuable Chinese medicines in the materials of old medicine, there are indeed many. But according to their current business, they only use two or three hundred kinds back and forth. If new medicine is promoted by society, the initial stage of sorting out is not difficult. "However, the placenta of children and women's pants (burnt crotch powder), those strange and barbaric things, seem to be able to be abandoned." Therefore, short-term and gradually reduced loopholes are not a problem. As for people who love to eat Chinese medicine, it is guaranteed that there are still people</p>
<p>of the farmers who grow the medicine and the merchants who sell the medicine who want to control the mouths of the reformers with all the livelihood problems. There is really no reason for this. May I ask, when the whole country bans opium and wants to eradicate poppy flowers, can someone stand up and say, "Take care of the livelihood of farmers, the business of local merchants, and the blood of opium dealers are all related," and never allow them to change to planting rice and wheat? Moreover, medicine is not in the list of eradication. For all reforms, there is a price for reform. It is necessary to first determine whether the reform is reasonable, and naturally the rest will be solved easily. It is better to adapt to the foot than to seek temporary peace. In the end, it will not be tolerated by the facts and will only suffer more setbacks. This issue of medical doctrine, although it is related to the two major institutions of education and administration, people in society must also recognize the trend of the times and use strong public opinion to support the early rise of new theories so that the essence of old medicine can be sorted out legally as soon as possible. On the one hand, I also hope that the children of old doctors will change their minds and not be traditional mystery believers. What can't be done in the world with a good youth? Why do you have to be obsessed with these unsuitable industries? ? You should know that today's society, people who praise a certain Chinese medicine doctor will not ask the student son of a certain Chinese medicine doctor to treat the disease in the future. If old medicine takes this opportunity to calculate the opportunity for traditional development, it is inevitable that the vision is short-sighted and you will be deceived by society.</p>
<p>In recent years, some people have taken the theories of new and old medicine to compare the strengths and weaknesses by the business of a few people. For example, Mr. Chu Minyi also wanted to cooperate with this method to take care of the disputes between the two sides. Mr. Jiao Yitang simply regarded the achievements of one or two people and the treatment cases of three or four people as ironclad cases to support old medicine. It's really not a solution. The Shanghai Sino-Western Sanatorium hangs the sign of the French Lang Peian on the one hand, and on the other hand, it sets up the consultation room of the national doctor Lu Zhong'an. As a result, each line does its own thing, and Chinese and Western medicines are mixed, isn't it still inexplicable. 丨If you want to thoroughly test it, you can only open a large hospital and invite several well-learned and well-known new doctors. All patients are admitted to the hospital, and the new doctors diagnose and determine the name of the disease, and then completely let the old doctors treat it. Let him acupuncture, massage, decoction, pills, or even visit famous mountains to find some fairy grass prescriptions. It's also okay. If you gather thousands of cases like this and make a statistics, for example, how many cases of gastric cancer are cured, how many cases of meningitis are cured, what is the mortality rate of typhoid fever, and how many cases of diphtheria and scarlet fever are cured, then you can study whose theory is right and wrong, and the effect lies in medicine and medicine. But this kind of thing requires society to stand up and urge it to be done, to speak fairly, not to just meet one's own preferences and say it empty.</p>
<h3>A Sincere Admonition to Those Aspiring to Reform Chinese Medicine (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Sha</p>
<p>(II) The Distinction Between Medicine and Materia Medica</p>
<p>If we want to improve traditional medicine, the first step is to clearly distinguish between "medicine" and "materia medica," and avoid conflating the two. This is because traditional medicine is entirely theoretical (based on unscientific theories), while traditional materia medica consists of substances tested through risky trials on millions of innocent patients. Although traditional medicines may possess certain efficacies, traditional medicine cannot provide accurate diagnoses. Instead, it relies on absurd pharmacological principles such as "cold, heat, warmth, coolness," "ascension, descent, floating, sinking," and "matching the five elements with the five viscera" to squander these valuable natural resources. Consequently, the results are often inefficient, achieving less than half the desired effect. Therefore, we must clearly distinguish between traditional "medicine" and "materia medica" before discussing reform. Otherwise, we will be led astray indefinitely.</p>
<p>Let's discuss traditional medicine. The theories of traditional medicine are preposterous and bizarre, filled with Yin-Yang and Five Elements. Most people who have dabbled in traditional medicine are likely aware of this. Even more straightforward works, such as Zhang Zhongjing's "Treatise on Cold Damage," are no longer applicable to modern practice. They might serve as reference material, but attempting to force them into practice would inevitably lead to their natural elimination. There is no shortage of criticism of traditional medical theories within the traditional medical community itself. However, finding articles that are insightful and align with my own thinking is not easy. The author most admires the "Spiritual Pivot and Its Commentary" and the "Six Qi Theory" (by Yu Yunxiu, found in Yu's Medical Discourses). These two texts have breached the main stronghold of traditional medicine, and other trivial debates cannot compare. Readers may wish to examine them to verify that the author is not deceiving them. Mr. Yu Yunxiu once said, "The theories of traditional medicine are preposterous and bizarre, and cannot be concealed. The only option is to allow them to perish. If we wish to preserve the national essence, there is still a glimmer of hope in formulas and medicinals. I have read the 'Shen Nong's Classic of Materia Medica.' Its writing is simple and unadorned, focusing on the tastes and properties of drugs, without mixing in absurd theories... Later scholars who studied medicinals, such as Wu Pu, Li Dangzhi, Tao Hongjing, and Xu Shen, adhered strictly to their teachers' methods, focusing solely on the effects of the medicinals, stating what was natural, and daring not to delve into mysterious pronouncements." (From the preface to Yu's translation of "Pharmacology," due to lack of the original text, only a rough outline is remembered). Insightful readers should consider this statement.</p>
<p>(III) Method</p>
<p>The so-called "good prescriptions" and "effective medicinals" touted by traditional doctors are only effective for one or two individuals and lack standardized criteria. To determine the exact efficacy of a certain medicinal, we must first have an accurate diagnosis. After diagnosing a specific disease, then use the drug and record its progress. Each such case counts as an example, and the more examples, the better. Gradually accumulate them, and then observe which diseases and symptoms they are most effective against, and the reasons for their effectiveness. If we confirm that a particular medicinal is clinically effective, then we can analyze its components and conduct scientific experiments. In the "National Medicine Review," Mr. Shen Jingfan wrote an article titled "Examples of Using Applied Statistics to Organize Chinese Medicines." Yu's Medical Discourses also contains an article titled "The First Step in Studying Domestic Medicinal Ingredients." Readers can refer to these, as they broadly outline methods for improving traditional medicines. Therefore, we should use statistical methods to study traditional medicines, which may yield some results. Otherwise, we would be like blind men riding blind horses into a deep pool at midnight, which is extremely dangerous. This is the method for improving traditional medicines. As for the theories of traditional medicine, many people seem to be clamoring for their reorganization. However, the results of such reorganization merely state that "whatever is found in modern medicine was already present in traditional medicine." In short, they aim to make countless young people believe that the various scientific theories discovered by the modern medical community were already known to our Shennong, Yellow Emperor, Zhang Zhongjing, and Sun Simiao thousands of years ago, and that "modern medicine must acknowledge that I am superior." If we abandon new scientific theories and insist on adhering to ancient theories, then those who wish China to survive on the world map for a few more days would not act in this way, would they? (See Section VI of this article.)</p>
<p>(IV) Tools</p>
<p>If we are using statistical methods to study traditional medicines to confirm the value of a certain medicinal, then what tools should we use? In recent years, the "new Chinese medicines" used by traditional doctors as "armored vehicles" merely highlight the reported effects of certain drugs, considering this to be the pinnacle of improving traditional medicine. They indiscriminately adopt others' reports, regardless of whether they are correct or not. They do not realize that this kind of work is temporary, not permanent. Permanent work involves taking the medicinal to the laboratory, carefully analyzing it, conducting various scientific experiments, and using it in clinical trials before applying it broadly in clinical practice. Consider Mr. Yu Yunxiu's "Analgesic and Anti-inflammatory Plaster," created using traditional medicines. Its development involved many twists and turns, much that was interesting, and much that deserves our admiration (see Liu Buqing's article in "New Medicine Times"). Friends! I tell you, without using science as a tool to study traditional medicines, you will not achieve good results. You will only obtain vague impressions.</p>
<p>(V) Materials</p>
<p>The materials used for studying traditional medicines are, of course, traditional medicines themselves. However, the medicines prepared in pharmacies are not suitable. What is suitable are the raw medicinal materials that are cultivated. Furthermore, the composition of raw medicinal materials varies depending on environmental factors such as sunlight, air, rainfall, geology, and harvest time. To manage these factors clearly and adequately, one must be proficient in "pharmacognosy." There is little research in China on this topic. The author is aware of Yuan Shefan, Xu Boyun, and others.</p>
<p>(VI) Refuting the Old</p>
<p>Since the absurdity and bizarreness of traditional medical theories have reached a point where they cannot be concealed, we should abandon them altogether. Why bother reorganizing them and citing classics to point out elements that coincidentally align with science (which is still a forced interpretation)? However, there are many in the traditional medical community who are engaged in this work. In the author's opinion, this is largely unnecessary. Because we live in a modern era where science is constantly evolving, why must we return to an ancient country thousands of years ago? Even if it does coincidentally align with science, we should simply adhere to science and not go to unnecessary lengths. Here, the author must quote Mr. Yu Yunxiu to prove this point. He said, "This kind of work can only use what scientific medicine already knows, what has already been verified, to prove the sayings of the ancients. And what is proven in the sayings of the ancients is all that is already known today in modern medicine. It is of absolutely no benefit or impact to modern medicine. From the standpoint of traditional medicine, this kind of work seems important. But from the perspective of modern medicine as a whole, this kind of work is merely uncovering the hidden virtues and obscure glories of the ancients, and contending for a place in the history of ancient, medieval, and recent medical history. As for its theories, modern medicine already knows them all, none of which are unnecessary, and none of which are beneficial." Readers probably fully understand the value of the so-called "reorganization of traditional medical theories" by traditional doctors, right? The author further quotes Liang Qichao of Xinhui to conclude this article.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Liang Qichao's Overview of Qing Dynasty Scholarship, page 145: "Picking up fragments of words and phrases from ancient books to convey modern meanings easily leads to two types of malpractices: First, if the meanings can be corroborated and match each other, that is good. However, if there is even a slight forced interpretation, it is most likely to mislead the public with incorrect notions and exacerbate the problem by drawing analogies. For example, when discussing constitutionalism and republicanism in the past, if one happens to find a sentence or word in the classics that has a meaning similar to constitutionalism or republicanism, one picks it up and gloats, claiming that this kind of thing is inherent to us. In fact, the constitutional system as it exists today, even in the West, only arose in the last hundred years. It cannot even be found in ancient Greece and Rome, let alone in our country. And when such analogies are widely spread, they can cause the majority of eyes and thoughts to be limited and bound by the cited words and phrases, leading them to believe that so-called constitutionalism and republicanism are merely like this, and they no longer pursue the true meaning... Such ingrained habits are most likely to become obstacles to the public's study of practical learning. Second, when persuading people to adopt this system, telling them that our sages have already practiced it; when persuading people to study this discipline, telling them that our sages have already studied it, it is naturally easier to persuade people. However, when this is used repeatedly, people will suspect that systems that our sages have not practiced are not feasible, and that disciplines that our sages have not studied are not worth studying. Inadvertently, it constantly increases the habit of complacency and hinders their discernment in choosing the good to follow... I am unwilling to pluck the blooming flowers of peach and plum trees from across the wall and attach them to the old trunks of cedars and pines in my garden, then gloatingly declare my satisfaction. I truly love peach and plum trees, but I should think about how to transplant them, not confuse them with the names and realities of cedars and pines." (Yimao Year, National Style Newspaper) It also said, "Although these debaters are focused on a single issue, they provide a glimpse of Qichao's overall critique of our old thoughts, and the path he believes should be followed for the development of new thoughts in the future. The chronic ailment of Chinese thought lies precisely in 'reliance on others' and 'confusion of names and realities.'"</p>
<p>In a word, the author hopes that China's entire medical and pharmaceutical industry will move in a new direction, and not be infatuated with outdated and dead theories. Furthermore, the author hopes that aspiring young people will no longer be poisoned by traditional medicine. The author's intention is that "gentlemen who observe it will be able to see where his ambition lies!" (End)</p>
<h3>The General State of Latent Tuberculosis and Its Benefits to the Human Body (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>The author believes that the lack of public awareness of tuberculosis has led to the terrible phenomenon that we see today. Although it is presented before our eyes every day, no one pays attention. The author feels unspeakable regret for fathers and brothers in the world. As for the patients themselves, the author is filled with pity. In fact, most latent tuberculosis patients are children and adolescents. If appropriate treatment and health maintenance are applied, astonishingly great effects can be achieved. The author believes that within just a few years, the weak constitutions of children and adolescents can be fundamentally improved. From this perspective, the importance of the prevention and health maintenance methods discussed here is even more evident.</p>
<p>(III) In addition to the two types mentioned above, there is another significant condition that must be classified as latent tuberculosis, namely the following types of patients, which are quite prevalent in the world.</p>
<p>Although a formal diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis or pleurisy is made, neither the patient nor others have ever perceived any obstacles to their physical well-being. The diseased part heals to a certain extent unnoticed. The so-called scar tissue forms in the apex of the lung or pleura, leaving behind a harmless mark. When these people happen to suffer from other diseases and are examined by a doctor, the doctor accidentally discovers it and is greatly alarmed, thinking that the tuberculosis is actively progressing and proposing various treatments. Patients often become very pessimistic upon hearing this. This is due to poor diagnostic skills. The tuberculosis is definitely not active today, but has already been healed. At this time, percussion of the apex of one lung may produce a dull sound or resistance, and auscultation may reveal a sharp change and prolongation of the exhalation sound, or the pleura may be thick and hardened on the back. These changes are absolutely nothing to be alarmed about. If you consult an experienced physician, they will be able to distinguish whether it is ongoing lung disease or pleurisy, or whether it has existed for many years, is mostly healed, and does not require treatment. This kind of differentiation is essential. In short, since it has mostly healed and has successfully become latent tuberculosis, it does not pose a dangerous threat to health. However, this area is prone to recurrence in later years, so while current treatment may not be necessary, future prevention is crucial for people with latent tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Let's summarize the three types above:</p>
<p>(1) Pulmonary tuberculosis is fortunately tending toward treatment and entering the recovery phase, and even regressing. Although it seems completely healed on the surface, it is often not completely cured in reality. Therefore, even patients who have once entered the recovery phase or have even been cured must still consider the latent pulmonary tuberculosis that persists for a long time and take care of their health.</p>
<p>(2) Those who are born with weak bodies and pale complexions are mostly latent tuberculosis patients. Although they may seem healthy at first glance, their latent pulmonary tuberculosis or pleurisy, and other types of tuberculosis, persist for a long time and are often overlooked.</p>
<p>Observing the world through the lens described above, the number of latent tuberculosis patients is shockingly large. How can one not feel chilled to the bone when considering the possibility of developing pulmonary tuberculosis at any time in the future? Therefore, the spirit of the health maintenance methods described here by the author applies not only to recovering patients who consider themselves ill, but also to people with weak bodies in general. It is a universal method of preventing and maintaining health against tuberculosis. It is by no means empty theory on paper, but a practical problem for us in the present. It is a method for improving the health and longevity of all people in the world.</p>
<p>▲ The Benefits of Latent Tuberculosis to the Human Body</p>
<p>The phenomena in the biological world often form a cause-and-effect relationship. The cause and effect often cycle and repeat. The author has already explained the terrifying aspect of latent tuberculosis, but the beneficial aspect of latent tuberculosis to the individual's body must also be explained. All bacterial diseases have a kind of immunity. Those who have contracted the disease once develop a defense substance in their bodies that allows them to enjoy the natural benefit of never contracting the disease again. For example, those who have contracted typhoid fever once will never contract typhoid fever again in their lifetime. The prevention method for smallpox, artificial smallpox vaccination, deliberately induces a mild form of smallpox, which can later avoid true, severe smallpox. The same principle applies to tuberculosis. Although there is no complete immunity to tuberculosis, a certain degree of immunity certainly exists. For example, those with scrofula (latent tuberculosis in children) in childhood are more likely to have a benign and non-progressive form of the disease when they develop pulmonary tuberculosis as adults. Conversely, those who were very healthy in childhood and did not have scrofula are more likely to develop tuberculosis rapidly when infected in their youth, often dying within a few years. This is because they did not have scrofula in the past and lacked immunity. Also, pulmonary tuberculosis that develops after pleurisy (most cases of pleurisy are tuberculous), or pulmonary tuberculosis that develops after tuberculous osteoarticular inflammation and spinal osteomyelitis (spinal osteomyelitis is tuberculosis of the spinal bones), or pulmonary tuberculosis that develops in those currently suffering from these diseases, is often mild, with fewer severe cases.</p>
<p>Observing it from this perspective, latent tuberculosis is indeed terrifying on the one hand, because as mentioned earlier, it carries the risk of breaking out at any time. But from another perspective, it can be said that having latent tuberculosis is actually very beneficial to the individual's body. Having it can prevent the outbreak of severe tuberculosis in the individual's body and acts as a safety valve. Therefore, there is no need to worry too much about children having scrofula. Moreover, from another perspective, scrofula can be considered evidence that safe protection against pulmonary tuberculosis is being carried out. If people can pay attention to and practice daily preventive health maintenance methods, there is nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is prevalent in human society and is a major enemy threatening human health, but it is not an entirely terrifying disease. The evidence is as follows. From the reliable diagnostic methods of autopsy or "Tuberculin" skin tests, it can be observed that more than 90 out of 100 people have some amount of latent tuberculous lesions in their bodies (see Section IV of the previous volume). However, the number of people who die from tuberculosis is only about one-seventh of all people. The remaining six-sevenths (85 out of 100 people), although infected with tuberculosis, are able to fight off tuberculosis for their entire lives and live out their natural lifespans. This proves it. In other words, humans are almost all infected with tuberculosis once, but there are many times more people who live a happy life in a state of latent tuberculosis than those who die from tuberculosis. In fact, in the current state of the world, it is very difficult for us to completely prevent the transmission of tuberculosis throughout our lives. For example, even in children, no matter how much effort is put into completely preventing transmission, many people are unknowingly infected with tuberculosis. This is because tubercle bacilli are commonly scattered everywhere on the ground, and there is nothing that can be done about it. Although prevention of transmission is necessary, since everyone has latent tuberculosis in their bodies, paying attention to daily health maintenance methods to ensure that there is no room for latent tuberculosis to break out in the body is the most important issue. The author is specially relaying these points to you. (End)</p>
<h3>Introducing the "Physical Therapy Clinic" to the Public and Medical Colleagues in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Dr. Pang Jingzhou published an article entitled "My Views on Concentrated Physical Therapy" in the first issue of Volume 5 of "Medical and Pharmaceutical Review." His idea was that the latest treatment methods are physical therapy and instrumental therapy, but these treatments are very expensive. Not many people in China can afford them. In order to adapt to the world trend, our doctors are buying X-ray machines and sunlamps. As a result, equipment is scattered and fragmented. Each piece of equipment can only be used by one or two people each day. Patients must search and inquire everywhere to find a treatment location. Unscrupulous doctors take advantage of this situation to profit and harm society. Due to the above inconveniences, Pang suggested establishing a joint-venture physical therapy clinic, or instrumental therapy clinic, to centralize all the equipment in one place, making it convenient and economical for patients to seek treatment.</p>
<p>Pang's article made us feel deeply aware. Physical therapy is indeed the latest and most effective treatment method. Diseases that cannot be heard or seen can be revealed by X-rays. All diseases that cannot be reached by drugs can be effectively treated with instrumental therapy such as diathermy, sunlamps, X-rays, and radium implants! Suspicions and errors in diagnosis can be resolved with this latest method! Our need for physical therapy is indeed imminent, not just to adapt to the world trend! However, looking at the current situation of the medical community, it is indeed as Pang said, the equipment is simple and cannot be centralized, and patients are tired of running around. The need is so urgent, but the equipment is so fragmented, which is truly disheartening!</p>
<p>Moreover, Pang only saw one side of the issue, and did not mention the other side. Everyone knows that the economic aggression of the great powers is intensifying every day. In the medical and pharmaceutical industry, foreign doctors and foreign medicines occupy the best positions. In Shanghai, noble patients are almost entirely taken care of by foreign doctors! Frankly speaking, this is not only due to the xenophobic mentality of the Chinese, but also due to their strong capital and complete equipment. Therefore, it is not that there are no good physical therapy locations in Shanghai, but unfortunately, these locations are controlled by foreigners! Because the Chinese medical community is too dependent and lacks creativity, and is unwilling to work hard to move forward, there is a lack of such well-equipped treatment locations, and foreign doctors take advantage of the weaknesses of the Chinese and greatly inflate their prices! The treatment fee for one session can be as high as thousands or tens of thousands of dollars, so only a small number of aristocrats and capitalists can afford this treatment. Most ordinary people can only run around and try at a few locations with incomplete equipment when they need this treatment!</p>
<p>To remedy this social distortion and to provide this treatment to the majority of ordinary people, Chinese-run physical therapy locations have been established in the past two years! However, the equipment is not complete, and the procedures are especially rudimentary. For example, X-ray photos are either blurry or lack explanations. How can patients know without explanations? In this situation where treatment is as good as no treatment, our patients still have to endure the pain and go to the foreigners.</p>
<p>We must realize Pang Jingzhou's proposal. However, our ideal physical therapy clinic must first meet the criteria of low price and high quality. Our purpose in establishing a physical therapy clinic is to reclaim rights and benefit the people. Only by doing things practically can we meet the criteria of "low price" and "high quality."</p>
<p>Great! Our ideal plan has been realized! The colleagues of the Aurora Drawing Society have established a "Shanghai Physical Therapy Clinic" at the Tiren Hospital on Julaida Road. The consultation fee is very low, the equipment is very new, the facilities are very complete, and especially, the technology is superb, the diagnosis is accurate, and the Chinese instructions are very detailed. The doctors and managers are also specialized and experienced. This is truly good news for patients who need this treatment, especially the common people. Colleagues! If you have patients who need this treatment, you may as well introduce them to try it. It is also your divine duty to guide and help them, and an opportunity to reclaim rights!</p>

<h3>Autumn Rain and Autumn Wind</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>Autumn is old, and it is so depressing again. It is truly distressing even without listening to the sounds of autumn, let alone with wind and rain!</p>
<p>I casually picked up a book from the shelf. Upon seeing that it was the "Anecdotes of the Xuanhe Era of the Great Song Dynasty," I already felt somewhat frightened. As I read through it page by page, from the Daoist Emperor's private visit to Li Shishi to his death in an earthen pit in Junzhou, where his corpse was pierced by the Jin people with wooden staffs and dragged into another stone pit until it reached the bottom, I couldn't bear to read any further. What was most heart-wrenching was his statement to Emperor Qinzong: "My ancestors' two-hundred-year legacy has been tainted by foreign barbarians. The disaster began with treacherous ministers. My family of over three thousand... has all become slaves!" I pondered, I pondered alone. This wasn't exactly melancholy for autumn. My deep resentment, besides the cries of grieving geese and cold crickets, was perhaps best understood by the wind and rain. Yet unfortunately, they are cursed by literati and scholars who like to enjoy the moon.</p>
<p>In the past few days, the newspaper has told us many news stories: something about "Fang Ji launching a large-scale invasion of a certain place"; something about "fierce fighting for a day and night, with artillery fire not ceasing"; something about "being unable to pursue due to the agreement"; something about "the people fleeing, in a state of extreme distress"; something about "Japanese planes dropping bombs, with unclear losses." Could these news stories truly be fulfilling the prophecy in the Tang History that "autumn is when heaven will shake, wither, and kill"? In that case, why are we cursing the autumn wind and autumn rain!</p>
<p>"I will eat the flesh of the Xiongnu when I am hungry, and I will drink the blood of the Jie slaves while laughing and talking." These are the heroic words in Yue Wumu's "Manjianghong." "Each sound of recalling our broken homeland exhausts how many tears of Xiang Lei. Do not let people hear it." This is the mournful cry in Zhu Guwei's self-inscription "Autumn Song of the Gengzi Year, Lang Taosha." One is a heroic utterance, one is a mournful cry. What feelings do we have after reading them? I'm afraid even the autumn wind and autumn rain may not understand.</p>
<h3>Remedy for Hunger</h3>
<p>— Drunken Fool</p>
<p>I have seen the phrase "grain-avoiding elixir" in old books, but I always thought it was the deceptive talk of quack doctors, not to be believed. Recently, a German doctor has invented a method to extract a nourishing substance from cottonseed, making it into pills said to nourish the body and allow one to avoid grains and alleviate hunger. In today's era of scientific advancement, such an amazing thing may be real. However, if it is successfully refined and shipped to China to be sold as a tonic, each bottle will cost several dollars and cents. Then, it will only be a grain-avoiding elixir that the rich can afford, not one for the poor. Wouldn't that just make the foreign devils rich? In fact, our country has never lacked remedies for avoiding grains and alleviating hunger. Yesterday, I found a piece of paper in a pile of old documents, printed in the early years of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing dynasty. I am now listing it below: Currently, natural disasters are rampant in various provinces, and the starving people wail everywhere. If philanthropists from all walks of life widely disseminate this information, or make these remedies to provide relief to the starving people, it would be more practical and beneficial than distributing money and rice. Moreover, in times of displacement and wandering, it can be used as dry rations for emergencies. It is truly a life-saving elixir!</p>
<p>(1) Three liters of sesame seeds and three liters of glutinous rice, both washed in water and dried in the sun, stir-fried over a low heat. First grind the glutinous rice into flour, mix it with the sesame seeds, and grind again. Separately, use three catties of red dates, boil them until soft, retain the juice and flesh, and filter out the skin and pits. Add it to the flour in a stone mortar and pound them together into pills, about the size of bullets, weighing about five mace (approximately 18.5 grams). Take with white soup. Take one pill each time, which can last for a day without hunger, and long-term consumption will prevent hunger.</p>
<p>(2) One and a half liters of adzuki beans, stir-fried; one and a half liters of soybeans, baked. Grind the two ingredients into powder. Take one he (approximately 100 ml) each time, three he per day, for ten days without hunger.</p>
<p>(3) Seven liters of soybeans and three liters of sesame seeds, washed clean and steamed immediately, without soaking for too long. After steaming, dry them in the sun and remove the husks, then steam and dry them again, for a total of three times. Pound them thoroughly into pills, about the size of walnuts. Take one pill each time, which can last for three days without hunger.</p>
<p>(4) Chestnuts, red dates, walnuts, and dried persimmons, all peeled and pitted, mashed and made into cakes, and dried in the sun. Eating one tael (approximately 37 grams) per day will prevent hunger.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Cartoons</h3>
<p>— By Qian Yun, artwork by Zuo Liang</p>
<p>—Via Shanghai—</p>
<p>Living in Shanghai, wealthy families in houses with lawns, not to mention having billiard rooms, bars, storage rooms, bathrooms, kitchens, garages, and servants' quarters; even glassware occupies a large room. Sometimes you can run a lap inside such mansions and still not see anyone. Other facilities are naturally extremely comfortable. Never mind the "fraudulent Alembic" worth twenty thousand, just the radios: a fourteen-tube radio in the living room isn't enough, the young master's bedroom has an eight-tube, and the young lady's boudoir has a twelve-tube; but the owners seem very busy and rarely turn them on!</p>
<p>Their income, however, often comes from just a few words on the telephone, ten or eighty thousand, entered into their accounts.</p>
<p>Compared to those living in houses with four, five, or six families crammed in, it's even more ridiculous and laughable. Their kitchens and rooms are all borrowed from the bedroom, pants and short shirts hung along the windowsill, acting like curtains. Not to mention the children's diapers hung like a string of national flags, and even lying at the feet of guests; it's best not to visit if you know your friend's plight. Furthermore, the neighbor, somehow, bought a four-tube radio, doesn't care about the electricity bill, and it's blasting all day, and even at half past two in the morning! It's causing him insomnia, lateness, and docked pay. He's said several times that he wants to move, but he still owes two months' rent and can't do it for the time being.</p>
<p>Writing some facts roughly here, I think it's enough; as for adding fuel to the fire, so-called "comments," it's unnecessary.</p>
<h3>A Trip to Wusong</h3>
<p>— Zhao Ziming</p>
<p>The narrow Shanghai-Wusong train is packed with passengers. It speeds along the straight rails. After passing the four-story Imperial Army barracks, you see the crumbling Commercial Press. The rumbling of the train awakens the silent countryside.</p>
<p>Inside the carriage are blue-clad workers, women from the countryside with bound feet, standing graceful female students, and spirited male students. At this moment, you can't tell who is the teacher and who is the worker. Everyone is standing on an equal footing.</p>
<p>The train arrives at the terminal, "Fort Taiwan." Following the crowd out of the train, you see the station with a large hole in the roof, the broken telephone poles, the windows and walls riddled with bullet holes... How can it not be shocking?</p>
<p>White waves roll on the sea. Couples are on the embankment; "Liangxiang chestnuts" shells and "Tianjin pears" are scattered all over the ground. The man sings loudly, "Yang Yanhui, sitting in the palace, thinking and sighing..." The woman echoes with a lullaby, "Baby wants to sleep..." The same tide, I wonder if they regard it as the Haining tide or the Yellow River tide? Are they here to pay homage or to have fun?</p>
<p>The fort is forbidden to visit, and armed guards are on duty. A female student was stopped by a soldier from going up. She said, "You'd rather be beaten by the Japanese than let the Chinese see!" This remark is witty, but it's not too late to mend the fold after losing the sheep!</p>
<p>Autumn wind and autumn rain, drizzling all day long, cotton harvest is poor. Three or five women from the countryside, wearing blue cloth headscarves and barefoot, are picking cotton over there, listening to them talking: "This year's cotton doesn't sell well, foreign cotton is cheap! Too much..."</p>
<p>Lights flicker, autumn insects chirp, Wusong's surroundings are even more bleak and desolate... The rumbling train still carries me back to the noisy city.</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Who Can Be Without Emotion? Family Thoughts Diminish Morale. Soldiers Despise Deceit, Bold Words Boost Army Morale.</p>
<p>As he went downstairs, he suddenly realized, what's going on? These old leather shoes of mine suddenly feel tight today. Looking down, he noticed that he had put his shoes on the wrong feet. So he sat on the stairs, took off his leather shoes, and held them. After putting them on correctly, he took two steps and still felt that the shoes were tight. Looking at them carefully again, he couldn't help but laugh. It turned out that the leather shoe he took off from his left foot was still on his left foot. He sat down a second time and switched the shoes. After putting on the shoes correctly, he calmly went downstairs. Wang Shili chased up from behind and said: Where is the company commander going? Zhao Ziqiang said: Going to the regimental headquarters. Wang Shili said: Aren't you going without a hat? Zhao Ziqiang then felt a cool breeze on his head. What's going on? Today's spirit is so confused. If the brothers know, wouldn't it become a joke? He laughed and said: Too busy, so busy that my mind is in a mess, throw me the hat. Wang Shili didn't dare to laugh, but he was also very puzzled in his heart. He gave him the hat and immediately turned around and left. This situation happened to be seen a little by Zhao Ziqiang. He immediately straightened his chest, tugged at the hem of his military uniform, sang a military song, and walked towards the regimental headquarters with big steps. Before he walked in the door, his back was already soaked with sweat. It turned out that the company commanders of this regiment were all there, sitting around a large dining table. Just as he was about to take his seat, the regimental commander came out. The regimental commander first looked around at each seat. No one was missing, so he asked: How is the preparation going? One of the battalion commanders stood up and reported that everything was basically ready. The regimental commander then puffed out his chest and said: Our regiment will depart tomorrow. Now there is an order from the brigade commander, take a look. Then he took out an order from his pocket and handed it to the battalion commander next to him. The order is as follows (220).</p>
<h3>A Hundred Images</h3>
<p>— Su Qiu</p>
<p>▲ The patriotism of the Chinese is like a flush toilet. Flush it once, and it comes rushing and torrential, but it ends in a flash. You have to flush it again to see the rushing, torrential tide again.</p>
<p>▲ The Japanese invasion of China is like syphilis festering on the body. Signing a ceasefire agreement is like getting a shot of 606. After a while, the syphilis will flare up again, and you have to get another shot of 606. The Fang Ji problem in the north recently seems like the season has come to spring again, and syphilis is about to flare up again.</p>
<p>▲ Unemployed friends are like sailboats that have lost their rudder in the sea. There is absolutely no guarantee when they will meet a savior, or sink into the sea.</p>
<p>▲ University students attending class is like going to a teahouse to listen to storytellers. If they are happy, they go; if they are not happy, they don't have to go.</p>
<p>▲ The Chinese Communist Party is like a heat boil on the forehead. Before it's healed here, it pops up there again.</p>
<p>Children's Paradise</p>
<h3>Children's Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>Methods of Filming Wild Animal Movies You often see movies of wild animals, but do you know how these films are taken? I am afraid most of you do not understand. I once met a movie photographer, and he told me: Filming wild animal movies has several dangers. The places where wild animals live are all in the frigid and tropical zones. The filming team may suffer from heatstroke and illness because of the hot climate; or freeze to death in the ice and snow because of the severe cold; or sleep in the wilderness and be harmed by wild animals and poisonous snakes; or fall to their deaths due to inconvenient transportation; or capsize and drown after being attacked by alligators while crossing rivers in small boats; the various dangers are really difficult to describe. A few years ago, a British film company's photography team had a total of twenty-eight members when they set out. They went to the wild animal territory in Africa to take pictures. After two months, only three survivors remained. The wild animal movies we have seen, such as "Human and Animal Wonders" and "Animal Kingdom Chronicles," cost almost one or two million in capital and sacrificed the lives of forty or fifty people. However, we often see very tense places in the films. How exactly are these films taken? Now I will tell you what my friend said. There are about three methods they use to film wild animals: The first type is natural photography; that is, to randomly photograph wild animals that live naturally. This method must not be seen by wild animals, and must be secretly hidden in rocky valleys and forests; climb up to the big trees; when wild animals come out, use telescopes to take pictures at will. The second type is for the photographer to first hide in an iron cage, or behind an iron fence, and wait at the important places where wild animals often come and go. One person is in charge of taking pictures; others either look around; or hold knives and guns to prevent wild animals from attacking; this type of photography is very dangerous, and there are often people who are bitten and killed by wild animals and poisonous snakes. The third type is to lead brave natives, prepare guns and weapons, and venture to various places to find wild animals. If they encounter wild animals, they take pictures while aiming at the wild animals; unless it is extremely dangerous, they will not fire. This kind of photography, which is very close to wild animals, is very dangerous, but it can capture the fierce image of wild animals from the front. I heard that the most ferocious wild animal, the rhinoceros, often kills people head-on. The fourth type is reflection-through photography; Process This is a newly invented method due to the progress of film technology; that is, using optics, using telescopes to capture real objects, and reflecting the real objects onto the screen Screen, and then observing the real objects from behind, and quickly capturing them with a telescope.</p>
<p>▲ Humans and Apes Indian university professor Kellogg conducted a comparative study of the intelligence of humans and apes by comparing his ten-month-old baby with a seven-month-old chimpanzee (also known as anthropoid apes, whose appearance and performance are closest to humans). He kept both separately in small rooms, and set conditions for equivalent education from the beginning to the end. At first, he taught them one by one how to use chopsticks, spoons, etc., separately according to the law. After a week, the chimpanzee could use it by itself, while the baby could only hold the spoon, not the chopsticks, and when using the spoon to drink milk, nine out of ten spoons did not reach his mouth and were spilled on his body. Kellogg then taught the method of dressing himself. Using the same clothes and the same method of instruction, after a week, the chimpanzee was able to dress as usual, while the baby still did not know the top and bottom ends of the clothes, could not find the sleeves and collar, and only turned the clothes over and over. Later, he taught the method of drinking tea. The chimpanzee would officially drink by himself in less than three days, while the baby could not hold the teacup after a week, and almost every time he got the teacup, it would spill before it even got close to his mouth. Professor Kellogg also tested memory. He installed entrances and exits in the room and taught them to enter from the east and exit from the west. The baby could not remember the east and west directions in less than five minutes. Although the chimpanzee had passed thirty minutes, he could still tell. According to the results of the nine-month experiment, Ke published that humans and apes, when educated under the same conditions, are not as good as chimpanzees in terms of intelligence, love, and memory. However, in terms of language, apes have undergone years of degradation, so it is always difficult to learn to be like humans. Since this study was published, it has caused a major shock among American scholars. Everyone is working hard to compare similar animals of various types, such as dogs and sheep, cows and horses, and other various birds and animals, in order to distinguish the level of animal intelligence.</p>

<h3>Transportation Construction and the National Economy</h3>
<p>— Xue Yisheng</p>
<p>Today's China is facing the crisis of rural economic bankruptcy internally and the pressure of international currency devaluation externally, resulting in a precarious production industry, a widening deficit, and a worsening people's livelihood. People with knowledge are deeply worried about this, so they have advocated rescue plans, some advocating a controlled economy to seek a balance in production and distribution, and others advocating inflated currency in the hope of raising domestic prices. The grand theories and noble ideas are admirable. However, as far as I can see, and as we are in the autumn of extreme depression of the domestic industry, it is appropriate to prescribe the right medicine for the disease and make practical plans. Although the policies of a controlled economy and inflated currency are not new and the intentions are not good, it is doubtful whether they can be implemented in practice and whether they will be effective in view of the current situation in our country. Today's Chinese people are still like a heap of loose sand, and even the central power cannot reach the frontier areas. How can a controlled economy with an overall plan be implemented? Even if the political problem is easily solved, before local autonomy is completed, all surveys and statistics will be impossible to start. And the implementation of a controlled economy must have precise surveys and reliable statistics as the basis for the facilities. Today, although there are some statistics, except for the customs trade records, most are not very reliable. Even in terms of population, some surveys show more than 450 million, some show 400 million, and some show less than 400 million. No one can answer what the actual number is. As for the area of cultivated land and the production and sales of various commodities, it is even more closely related to the implementation of a controlled economy, and the existing statistics are mostly based on estimates, and few are based on accurate surveys. Even the figures recorded in the customs records are not completely reliable due to tax exemptions and smuggling. In addition, China's politics have not been on track and the people's wisdom has not been popularized. People are bound to be suspicious of official surveys, so even if they conduct on-site surveys, they may not be able to fully believe them. In this situation, how can a controlled economy be effectively implemented? If we cannot give up eating because of choking, then we should diligently seek governance to gradually establish facilities, and should not act rashly to avoid losing credibility with the people. As for inflating the currency, although it is easier to implement, if we say that we can only rely on the power of currency inflation to raise the level of prices, we can save the crisis of the national economy, then the facts may not be so simple. Although increasing the currency is enough to stimulate production, its stimulation is only temporary and not permanent. Moreover, the reason for the decline in prices in our country is not due to the lack of currency, but due to the decline in the people's purchasing power. As for the reason why the people's purchasing power has declined, the reasons are complex, and the fall in the price of silver is not one of the key factors. In theory, the fall in the price of silver seems to be able to promote export trade and increase the people's purchasing power, but due to the underdeveloped production industry in our country, there is a surplus of agricultural products and insufficient production of daily necessities, so we still have to rely on the import of foreign goods. Even the agricultural products that can be self-sufficient cannot be matched due to the undeveloped transportation and uneconomical transportation, and there is a contradictory phenomenon of some agricultural products being abandoned on the ground and a large amount of rice and wheat being imported. In addition, the fall in the price of silver has caused the sympathetic fall in world prices. Goods from various countries have to regard our country as the tail end of dumping. Therefore, in the past few years, although the price of silver has plummeted, imports have not decreased and the people's purchasing power has not increased. The theory and facts have shown their contradictions everywhere. In the future, we should focus on improving the facts so that those who can be self-sufficient do not have to rely on others, and those who cannot be self-sufficient should also find ways to be self-sufficient, and then there will be a plan. We do not advocate returning to the closed-door era, but since international cooperation is impossible, only self-sufficiency can overcome the environment.</p>
<p>The meaning of self-sufficiency is to seek the adjustment of goods, which is different from the inflated currency that focuses on the adjustment of currency. We know that inflating the currency is a hundred times easier than adjusting the goods, but as evidenced by the past history, once a country inflates the currency, it will experience panic. The previous events can be used as a warning. Even in recent examples, if inflating the currency can revive the economy, then whether it is England or France, they can settle for depreciated currency after the European war, why bother to painstakingly seek to restore the gold standard. After the United States recently abandoned the gold standard, it can also use the paper currency policy, why prohibit the export of gold to retain a large amount of gold in the country. Moreover, according to our observations, in the near future, the gold standard will have a day of recovery. It is particularly inappropriate for our country to adopt an inflationary policy at this time. Moreover, merely inflating the currency without seeking to improve the quality of commercial goods and reduce the cost of production will not increase exports. But if we rely solely on domestic consumption, then if the degree of domestic price increase exceeds the proportion of foreign currency depreciation, I am afraid that those who used to be happy to use domestic goods will turn to foreign goods. As a result, it will increase imports and will not help the production industry. Moreover, after the currency value is reduced, it is equivalent to invisibly reducing the wealth of the asset class, and therefore consumption will inevitably shrink accordingly, and the overall national economy may not be worth the loss. Therefore, even with the developed production industry in the United States, the inflation plan is still under careful consideration, and to say that our country's infant industry can develop the national economy by inflating the currency, I really dare not believe it. I think that to adjust production today, we must achieve the eight words of smooth flow of goods and full use of land. And today, the reason why the flow of goods in our country is not smooth and the land is not fully utilized is due to the unsound transportation facilities. Therefore, instead of the government controlling the production and sales of goods, it is better for the country to focus on the construction of transportation. Please allow me to repeat my statement.</p>
<p>(1) The transportation industry is the lifeline of a country. In the past, Ye Yuhu had a theory of saving the country through transportation, and Premier Sun Yat-sen also had a plan for transportation construction. There has never been a case where the national fortune has not been thriving with the development of transportation. The facts of the United States after independence and Japan after the Meiji Restoration are obvious and need no further explanation. Therefore, if we want to seek the prosperity of our country's national economy in the future, the development of transportation cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>(2) Our country is based on agriculture, and the fall in food prices has a great impact. The reason for the fall in food prices is that the obstruction of transportation is a major factor. The food problem in our country is not a problem of poor harvest, but a problem of uneven distribution. Therefore, even in years of abundant harvest, there are still alarming imports of foreign rice and wheat. If transportation is convenient and food is freely circulated, imports can be reduced and market prices can be maintained. Otherwise, even if tax rates are raised, it may not help. Therefore, to save the countryside, the first priority is to develop transportation.</p>
<p>(3) Our country's currency system has always been extremely chaotic. Recently, the abolition of taels and the conversion to yuan have been successful, but the currency prices in various places are still uneven. Although it is due to the different supply and demand of currency in various places, the inconvenience of transportation and the high cost are the fundamental reasons. Therefore, to equalize the currency prices in various ports and adjust the national finance, the development of the transportation industry is indispensable. Moreover, with convenient transportation, the cost of commercial goods can be reduced, and business profits can be increased. The financial community can rest assured to make loans, so the market will gradually become prosperous.</p>
<p>(4) Our country's natural treasures have not been developed, but it is empty talk to develop without first developing transportation. People are accustomed to being comfortable, so who would dare to risk all dangers to go deep into the uncultivated land. Therefore, it is appropriate to guide the situation and make the remote and isolated areas connected with the major cities, and then find ways to encourage the people to migrate, which will be easier and more effective. Moreover, the development of transportation is a huge project, which can increase the opportunities for two people to work and eliminate the unemployed population in the society, which is a good thing in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>(5) In recent years, internal wars in our country have been frequent, and the impact on the production industry is not small. The reason is due to the separatist rule of the warlords, and also due to the inconvenience of transportation, which has led to the central power being out of reach, and rebellions have emerged one after another. Therefore, to seek the stability of the entire society in the future, so that the people can live and work in peace, and the market and finance will no longer be affected by the war! Then we must devote ourselves to transportation construction.</p>
<p>Although to complete the construction of transportation, the government and the financial community must cooperate fully. Today, the financial community is suffering from abundant funds and no way to use them. If the government has a complete plan for the transportation industry! With the determination to build, the financial community will surely be happy to support it. Saving the country through transportation is all about this generation. I hope those who have the responsibility of planning the country will carefully consider it.</p>
<h3>Steps for Cotton Industry Promotion</h3>
<p>— Fang Junqiang</p>
<p>Cotton is used very extensively, and the prosperity or decline of the cotton industry has a particularly significant impact on national economy and people's livelihood. Upon examining the failure of China's cotton industry, the crux of the problem lies in the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The government lacks an overall plan for promoting and rescuing the cotton industry. Cotton farmers, cotton merchants, and textile operators each prioritize their individual interests, lacking a spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. (2) Cotton farmers are ignorant and unwilling to improve, planting native cotton that is short in staple and of poor quality, which is no longer suitable for today's mechanized textile industry, resulting in shrinking sales and declining production. (3) Cotton merchants are short-sighted and blinded by immediate profits, readily buying up short-staple native cotton, which is easy to adulterate with water, extensively purchasing it, damaging cotton buying and preventing the promotion of fine-staple, high-quality varieties. (4) Because native cotton is unsuitable, the textile industry does not encourage cotton farmers to switch to better varieties, but relies on foreign raw materials. Once manipulated by foreign merchants, costs immediately soar. At the same time, factory management is improper, worker training is insufficient, and production costs increase. Chinese-owned factories lack coordination among themselves, and once faced with the dumping and "wholesale competition" of foreign goods, they suffer losses and close down one after another.</p>
<p>Combining the above four reasons has led to the current situation where Chinese cotton is insufficient, unsuitable, and the Chinese textile industry is collapsing. Last year, national cotton production decreased by more than 3 million dan compared to 1918. The number of spindles in operation in yarn factories decreased by one-third compared to 1924. Imports of foreign cotton and cotton goods reached a staggering 580 million yuan annually. If this loophole is not plugged, the country will be in peril. There is no need for imperialists to use airplanes and cannons to control our people's lives. So, what is the solution? The answer is: "Untie the bell, tie the bell!" Only by the consistent awareness and cooperation of our government, the textile industry, cotton merchants, and cotton farmers, to promote the cotton industry, can we find a solution. We should concentrate the financial and human resources of the government and the textile industry to awaken the awareness and determination of cotton farmers and cotton merchants to improve, then unite to rationalize cotton production. Investigate the cotton production, climate, and wasteland situation in various provinces, open up cotton fields to increase production, so that the Chinese people have enough cotton for their needs, and then the import of foreign cotton can be stopped. Establish cotton improvement stations everywhere, propagate fine-staple, high-quality cotton, implement a local pure-strain system, set standards for cotton grades, strictly prohibit practices of adding moisture and adulteration, to improve quality, so that the textile industry has usable raw materials to manufacture inexpensive fine cloth, and then we can contain the dumping of imported cotton goods. Furthermore, set up ginning and oil-pressing factories to reduce the labor of cotton farmers and prevent the spread of inferior cotton varieties. Establish cotton warehouses and packaging plants to facilitate cotton farmers' storage and transportation, and to prevent cotton from being moistened and adulterated. Establish cotton farmer loan offices and cooperative guidance centers to alleviate the economic burden of cotton farmers and prevent monopolization by cotton brokerages. Promote cotton farmer education and hold cotton industry demonstration meetings to increase cotton farmers' knowledge and skills in cotton planting. Conduct nationwide surveys and estimations of cotton production and cotton trade, and publish them regularly for reference by cotton merchants and the textile industry. Organize national and local textile industry federations, adhere to unity, to resist the aggression and oppression of foreign merchants. Apply protective tariff policies, raise import taxes, levy anti-dumping taxes, and ban foreign merchants from establishing factories in China, so that the revival of China's cotton industry may have a chance. Now, based on my limited understanding, I propose the following promotion steps, divided into four phases.</p>
<p>Phase 1</p>
<p>(1) Conduct cotton industry surveys in various provinces: Organized by agricultural administration agencies in each province, focusing on items such as the number of acres of cotton fields, cotton production, cotton varieties, the number of acres of wasteland suitable for cotton industry promotion, local climate, and transportation conditions, and conduct accompanying surveys of the rural economy, farmers' livelihoods, and the status of major agricultural products.</p>
<p>(2) Formulate implementation plans for opening up cotton fields in various provinces: The heads of agricultural administration agencies in each province, based on survey results, together with local senior agricultural education institutions and cotton industry experts, formulate implementation plans for increasing cotton acreage in the province, and agricultural administration authorities should request investment from the textile industry to prepare land reclamation funds.</p>
<p>(3) Designate central cotton-producing areas in various provinces and establish large-scale provincial cotton improvement stations: Designate the most prosperous cotton-producing areas in each province as central cotton-producing areas (such as Lingbao in Henan, Xiaogan in Hubei, Yuyao in Zhejiang, and Dongliu in Anhui). Establish one large-scale provincial cotton improvement station in each area (existing cotton industry organizations or school cotton fields can be expanded). Internally, each station should be divided into the following ten departments: 1. "Breeding Department": Select and breed superior new varieties. Before new varieties are bred, focus on propagating existing effective varieties for promotion during the transition period. In stations north of 40 degrees north latitude, propagate Lingbao cotton and Tuoshi American cotton. In stations to the south, propagate Baiwan cotton, Xiaogan cotton, Chicken Foot cotton, and Ai Zi American cotton. 2. "Testing Department": Specialize in variety testing and cultivation method testing. Promising varieties should be handed over to the Breeding Department for breeding and propagation. 3. "Promotion Department": Plan and implement local pure-strain systems, distribute improved cotton seeds to cotton farmers, and issue seed receipt certificates. Cotton farmers can sell cotton to the station's Cotton Collection Department with the certificate and enjoy benefits such as free ginning, packaging, oil pressing, and storage, and can also get preferential loan access from the station's Loan Department. 4. "Loan Department": Specialize in issuing loans to cotton farmers, limited to those who use the improved cotton seeds from the station for cotton production, charging extremely low interest rates, and deducting repayment during the autumn cotton harvest and payment. 5. "Cotton Collection Department": Specialize in collecting improved cotton from the station, raising prices to strengthen farmers' confidence, and guaranteeing that those who receive improved cotton seeds will have a market for their products. 6. "Ginning Department": Equip new-style cotton gins. Ginning is free for those who have a seed receipt certificate. Cottonseeds can be exchanged at the station's Promotion Department for improved seeds propagated that year. Those who do not promote cotton but request ginning will also be welcomed, but a ginning fee will be charged, and their cottonseeds will be collected. The Promotion Department will exchange them for improved cotton to prevent cotton farmers from lacking seeds for planting. 7. "Packaging Department": Equip new-style cotton presses. Those who have seed receipt certificates and request packaging of improved cotton will only be charged for the wrapping material and will be exempt from the packaging fee. Non-improved cotton that has been inspected and found to be free of moisture and adulteration can be packaged for a fee that includes both the wrapping material and the packaging. Cotton that has been moistened or adulterated will be refused packaging. A packaging certificate will be attached to the cotton bales packaged by the station, indicating the grade and quality of the cotton inside. 8. "Oil Pressing Department": Equip new-style oil presses. Those who have seed receipt certificates can exchange undegenerated improved cottonseeds for refined oil at a price slightly higher than the cottonseed price. Cottonseeds that are not from improved varieties, or degenerated improved cottonseeds, can also be pressed for a small fee. 9. "Cooperation Department": Guide and assist cotton farmers in organizing production cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, marketing cooperatives, and other cooperatives. 10. "Education Department": Hold cotton farmer literacy schools and schools for cotton farmer children, teaching cotton planting knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>The funding and personnel for departments 1, 2, 3, 9, and 10 will be provided by the government, while the capital for departments 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will be invested by the textile industry, with personnel provided jointly by the government and the textile industry.</p>
<p>(4) Conduct surveys, statistics, and estimations of cotton production and trade conditions in various provinces: The provincial-level cotton industry organizations should publish these regularly for reference by the textile industry.</p>
<p>(5) Establish cotton inspection bureaus in various provinces: Promulgate cotton grade standards and rules for prohibiting the addition of moisture and adulteration, and strictly prohibit bad habits among cotton merchants.</p>
<p>(6) Organize a textile industry federation: In textile industry centers such as Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Qingdao, concentrate the financial resources of various Chinese-owned factories, unite, cooperate in production and sales, rationalize enterprises, and strive for co-existence and co-prosperity to counter foreign-owned factories in China.</p>
<p>(7) Implement protective tariff policies: Raise import taxes, levy anti-dumping taxes, and ban foreigners from establishing factories in China.</p>
<p>Phase 2</p>
<p>(1) Encourage people to open up cotton fields: Provincial governments should earnestly promote implementation according to the plans formulated in the previous phase, allocating wasteland and cotton seeds to farmers, and providing as much assistance as possible within the range of possibilities.</p>
<p>(2) Designate cotton-producing areas in various provinces and selectively establish cotton improvement branch stations: Select important cotton-producing counties in various provinces to establish cotton improvement branch stations, subordinate to and supervised by the provincial cotton improvement headquarters. Their organization and work will be the same as the provincial station, but on a smaller scale.</p>
<p>(3) Hold cotton industry exhibitions and cotton industry demonstration meetings: Hold these events on a rotating basis in various regions for cotton farmers to observe and learn from.</p>
<p>(4) Continue the work of items 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the previous phase.</p>
<p>Phase 3</p>
<p>(1) Continue to encourage people to open up cotton fields.</p>
<p>(2) Establish cotton improvement branch stations in all cotton-producing counties of various provinces, with the same organization and work as the cotton improvement branch stations established in the second phase.</p>
<p>(3) Continue the third and fourth items of the previous phase.</p>
<p>Phase 4</p>
<p>(1) Replace old varieties with new varieties in cotton-producing areas nationwide and strictly implement local pure-strain systems: After the preparations of the previous three phases, cotton stations have been established everywhere, and superior new varieties should have been bred. Therefore, a local pure-strain system must be strictly implemented to thoroughly improve cotton varieties.</p>
<p>(2) Forcibly eliminate inferior native varieties: All native cotton seedlings should be uprooted to prevent the spread of impure strains.</p>
<p>(3) The national textile industry should be united as one: Use all efforts to compete with foreign factories. Eliminate the basis of imperialist economic aggression by defeating foreign factories in China one by one in stages.</p>
<p>(4) Continue the third item of the previous phase.</p>
<h3>The Necessity of Regulating the Fishing Industry</h3>
<p>— Qu Ruoqian</p>
<p>The call for economic regulation is currently sweeping through society. Since Minister Song returned to China and made statements about regulation, there has been an expansion of the Economic Commission, which is a response to the demands of the times and an attempt to avert danger at the last moment. China's implementation of economic regulation naturally begins with individual regulation of various industries. Therefore, the Economic Commission has organized regulation committees for grain, cotton, coal, silk, mining, and other industries. However, the fishing industry, which occupies an important position in the people's livelihood, has not yet received the government's attention. How can one not speak out in its behalf?</p>
<p>The decline of China's fishing industry has reached its extreme. Internally, fishing villages are bankrupt and pirates are rising up in swarms. Externally, neighboring countries are encroaching on fishing grounds and dumping their catches in abundance. The reason for the decline is that the long coastline of thousands of miles and the millions of fishermen have historically lacked management and guidance. Fishermen's knowledge remains ignorant and outdated, and old fishing methods are not being improved. Fishing is concentrated in one place, leading to overfishing, which has resulted in a gradual decline in catches and a reduction in production. The caught fish are poorly processed, making them difficult to preserve and unable to be sold to distant places, making profits extremely difficult. Fish merchants also only know how to sell to one place. For example, Shanghai has historically been a distribution center for fish products. Thus, regardless of the quality, quantity, supply, or demand of the market, everyone considers Shanghai as the only sales destination, without knowing how to choose locations and prices for sales. Fish prices are often in danger of plummeting. Furthermore, foreign aquatic products in the market are dominating, using dumping tactics to lower prices and disrupt the fish market, forcing Chinese fish products to lower prices for sale and suffer more losses, which is in effect taking the lifeblood of Chinese fishermen. In addition, with exploitation by local bullies and oppression by government officials and merchants, fishermen are abandoning their nets. The good ones seek a living in the cities, while the fierce ones become sea bandits. Only the old and weak remain to work, barely eking out a living. Fish production is naturally weak. Weak production gives foreign goods the opportunity to dump their products. Foreign goods dumping makes it harder for fishermen to survive, leading them to become bandits. When sea pirates are rampant, production is even smaller, creating a cycle of cause and effect. This is why China's fishing industry is declining and is in the unmanageable state it is in today. If we continue to wait and see without taking remedial measures, in a few years Chinese fishermen will have no chance of survival, and the instability of the seas will be even worse than it is today.</p>
<p>China's fishing industry is indeed, as many people say, still in its infancy. But how can we promote its improvement and assist its development? This is something we should pay attention to urgently. The coastal towns in China are where fishermen are concentrated and natural resources are extremely abundant. The reason they are on the verge of collapse is precisely because of a lack of regulation, leading to extreme disorganization. They do not know how to improve technology, and they often engage in factional fights. Although various fishing associations have been organized off the coasts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, their performance is only to collect money from fishermen and have no effect on improving the fishing industry. As for the fishermen themselves, they are ignorant and fierce and have no understanding of their industry. Once they have a good catch and money in hand, they engage in gambling and prostitution. Once production is insufficient and capital is lost, they gather crowds to rob and cause trouble everywhere. All these situations can be seen clearly by going to various islands in the outer seas. The reason why the fishing industry cannot progress is due to this. Therefore, it is necessary to organize various rational fishing associations, provide education for fishermen, investigate the fishing village economy, and seek fundamental improvements for them. Therefore, without a strong regulatory agency, detailed investigation, and careful planning, success cannot be achieved. It is useless to just sing empty tunes about protecting fishermen.</p>
<p>Furthermore, transportation and sales must also be regulated. Chinese fish merchants only transport to the distribution centers for normal sales, without asking what the needs of the place are, or thinking about the benefits of promoting sales to the interior. How can everything be sold? How can prices be stabilized? They are indifferent and do not consider it. For example, last year's cuttlefish merchants collected all the cuttlefish in the Shengshan area and transported it to Shanghai. The products of the Zhoushan Islands were collected by various cuttlefish businesses in Ningbo. Because of their own blind business operations, there was no communication, resulting in stagnant sales and a lot of abandoned goods. The author went to various islands this spring to investigate and met people in the industry in Ningbo, who all said that business had been bad in recent years. The total business volume of the Ningbo trade associations for the whole year was only three to four hundred thousand yuan. The narrow sales channels last year caused a lot of goods to be stockpiled, creating a situation where they were awaiting death. However, according to the statistics on the import of aquatic products last year, just considering dried cuttlefish from Japan, the amount sold in China reached 11,479 dan, worth 329,489 gold units, equivalent to about 600,000 yuan in national currency. The alarming value shows that the domestic market has a strong need for dried cuttlefish. The loss is due to the fact that Chinese fish merchants do not know how to transport and sell. (Cuttlefish merchants are still losing money this year, but there are no accurate statistics or investigations yet.) Therefore, the problem can be avoided if transportation and sales are regulated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, China's aquatic product trade has always been in a state of deficit, and the dumping of Japanese goods in recent years is enough to devastate the survival of China's fishing industry. Although Chinese people are wary of Japanese aquatic products, general traders are changing labels, falsely claiming they are domestic goods, or smuggling them in and selling them privately inland to reap huge profits. This is truly the biggest obstacle to the future of the fishing industry. If there were an agency to regulate trade, seafood merchants would be under control and unable to freely buy and sell. Therefore, even if the price of Japanese products were to fall, it would be difficult to find buyers. If they were to transport them to China on their own, it would be difficult to trade directly with consumers, and they would not be able to sell as well as they do now. Therefore, even if regulation cannot completely restrict the free buying and selling of traders, at the very least accurate statistics can be obtained to determine the domestic supply and demand situation, which will certainly allow for appropriate restrictions on imports to prevent the large-scale import of foreign aquatic products from directly affecting the survival of domestic industries.</p>
<p>Moreover, after the implementation of regulation, detailed research can be conducted in all areas, such as how is the production and demand for a certain product in China? How is it transported and sold to the interior? What are the import values from foreign countries? How much harm are they causing to China? What are the strategies for resisting them? And what are the means to revitalize China's aquatic industry? All these issues can be answered one by one after careful investigation and planning, so that the revitalization of the fishing industry has hope. Furthermore, the prevention of sea pirates that people are talking about today is indeed an urgent task, but this is just one aspect of a temporary solution. As we have said before, the occurrence of sea piracy is mostly caused by fishermen being subjected to various oppressions. Therefore, by unblocking the aquatic economy and stabilizing the lives of fishermen, the ocean can be calmed and the fishing industry can be revitalized. Therefore, to seek the revival of the fishing industry, it must be done through the regulation of the fishing industry.</p>
<p>As for the development of modern fishing vessels today, it is also one of the urgent measures to revitalize the fishing industry, but there are still various problems. The author will not elaborate on them here. However, to revive the fishing industry from its dying state, it will not succeed without regulation.</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Call Loans Still at Six Percent</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai's business community adopted the Gregorian calendar in recent years, banks of all sizes have routinely taken Sundays off as holidays. Although pawnshops remain open, they only serve as a minor complement to the quiet scene. However, the lack of clearing and settlement channels is a deficiency. The shape of term call loans should be strong but for the Sunday holiday relation. In the midst of a busy business it is suddenly silent, this too is the direction of the trend, and it is beyond human power to resist it. Yesterday's foreign call loans were at 6 percent in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The volume of call loan transactions in the morning session was more than 4.1 million yuan, with new transactions exceeding 600,000 yuan. In the afternoon session, the volume was more than 200,000 yuan. The volume of transactions in the small general association was more than 300,000 yuan. The volume of clearing and settlement of foreign banker's drafts by pawnshops was more than 34 million yuan. Due to the closure of banks, the clearing and settlement of foreign exchange header accounts could not be processed smoothly. In terms of foreign collateral loans and term loans, pawnshops saw both inflows and outflows. Collateral loans totaled more than 2 million yuan, and term loans exceeded 4 million yuan. The market price of auxiliary currency, Jiangnan small silver coins, was 836.2 yuan in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The volume of transactions in the morning session was 4,000 jiao, and in the afternoon session, it was 3,000 jiao. The price of Guangdong small silver coins was 784 yuan in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The volume of transactions in the morning session was 50,000 jiao, and in the afternoon session, it was 20,000 jiao. Copper coins were priced at 1,000 cash, or 304,000 cash, per tael. The volume of transactions was 32,528 strings of cash, worth 10,700 yuan.</p>

<h3>Term Ningbo Loans Released in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Yesterday, pawnshops brought a large batch of cash from Ningbo to Shanghai for distribution. As a result, the total amount of cash distributed reached four to five million yuan. In addition, the amount of old account rollovers and transfers and the settlement of the previous period's procedures was no less than three to four million yuan. It is said that this lending was handled by pawnshops in Shanghai on behalf of merchants from various industries, including dyes, pawned goods, foreign goods, grains, and import and export businesses. The amount of money borrowed varied, and the interest rates were also uneven. From what I have heard, the rates ranged from 8.5 yuan to 10.75 yuan, with as many as seven or eight different rates in between. As for lending by local pawnshops, although there were no large-scale transactions, there were old account rollovers. However, judging from the situation, other small loans, except for large factories that had no choice but to roll over their accounts, would likely not be rolled over. It is appropriate that the market is sluggish and turnover is inflexible.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3>The Weak Trend of the Bond Market Last Week Amidst Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Last week, from October 16th to 21st, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw a rather sluggish market. Major players were actively selling, especially firms numbered 21, 33, and 54, whose selling was the most vigorous. The Cantonese firms also participated in selling. The underlying reasons for this are worth studying. It seems that both speculative and fundamental factors played a role. Major players were buying, especially firms numbered 4, 31, 38, 41, and 50, as well as smaller buyers from Northern firms. Here too, both covering shorts and establishing new long positions were present. Sellers based their actions on the tight domestic financial situation and the worsening relations between Japan and Russia, while buyers based theirs on the stable political situation, the pacification of Fang Ji, and the gradually improving situation in North China. It was a case of "different people, different perspectives," each with their own reasonable basis. In reality, the trends last week were not greatly influenced by the overall environment. Fluctuations in the market price were mainly driven by the strength of each side, the supply and demand of chips, and the magnitude of underlying reserves held by each side, indicating that both sides had considerable strength. With only four days left before the settlement period, both sides likely engaged in hedging and mutual squeezing. On Monday, vigorous selling by firms 33 and 54 caused the market price to drop sharply, by a few cents to over a dollar. This was one of the days with the greatest price fluctuation of the entire week. On Tuesday, due to buying by firms 41, 47, and Northern firms, although firms 33 and the Cantonese firms still sold, the volume was small, and the market price rebounded by forty or fifty cents. On Wednesday, firms 4 and 50 in the financial sector bought, while firms 6 and 11 sold, causing the market price to fall again by thirty or forty cents. On Thursday and Friday, the market was relatively stagnant, with some sideways movement. Both sides engaged in steady hedging, with varying prices and very small volumes. Saturday morning was also stagnant, with neither gains nor losses. The afternoon remained stable until the closing bell, when the market prices of the 20th Customs Bonds and Consolidated Salt Tax Bonds fell by thirty to fifty cents due to large-scale selling by firm 21. In summary, the market prices for the week fell by several cents to one or two dollars. The total transaction volume was 48,014,000 yuan, including 4,000 yuan in spot transactions and 48,000,000 yuan in futures. The following table lists the details (transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn &amp; Floral Fabrics: Fluctuating American Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market initially rose due to speculator buying but later fell due to hedging in the South and weakness on Wall Street. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, while futures prices fluctuated up or down by one to three points per pound. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by three points, and futures prices rose by four to six points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by three points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to a lack of rain in the Oomra region, short covering, and speculative buying. As a result, Pinga rose by two rupees and seven and a half annas, Oomra rose by three rupees and seven and a half annas, and Bai Luo Creek rose by two and a half rupees.

<h3>Grain: The Decline of Broken Rice Continues</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over forty boats arrived from various locations. Sales of kiln-dried "Baige" rice were still strong, with a total of about a thousand bags. However, demand from the Hakka buyers was slightly tight. Sellers, constrained by the price of unhusked rice in the interior, did not offer much stock and were unwilling to make concessions, still intending to raise prices, leading to a stalemate between the two sides. Prices were only released near noon, but the market remained stable. As for various grades of new "Geng" rice, such as white rice and wild rice, the market was still struggling to improve due to continuous inflows and limited sales channels, causing prices to be reduced by over twenty coppers. "Du Yang" rice also depreciated slightly as a result. Various broken rice varieties, especially the "Songjiang Zhongguan" variety handled by Northern firms, totaling about a hundred and ten bags, were difficult to sell due to high inventory levels, making it difficult to stimulate demand. The market showed a general downturn, with prices falling by another one or two cents. New "Yinyuan" rice was scarce and showed a slight advantage.</p>

<h3>Foreign Countries Have It Too</h3>
<p>— Fu Ling</p>
<p>Everything that China has, foreign countries have too.</p>
<p>Foreigners say China has many bedbugs, but Western countries also have bedbugs. The Japanese laugh at Chinese people for playing with words, but the Japanese also play with words in the same way. Gandhi practices non-resistance; Hitler forbids hitting foreigners; De Quincey smoked opium; Dostoevsky was driven mad by gambling. Swedes have the custom of wearing a yoke, and Marx was reactionary. Colonel Lindbergh's son was kidnapped by kidnappers. And the difference between foot binding and high heels is not so great.</p>
<p>Only when foreigners say we don't care about public interest, only know how to benefit ourselves, and love money, we have no way to argue back. Since the Republic of China, there have been many presidents and rich officials who, after leaving office, are all round-faced, or compose poetry, or watch plays, or chant Buddhist scriptures, eating endlessly, which really seems to give evidence to the critics. Unexpectedly, today I found that foreign countries have it too!</p>
<p>"Havana, 17th – Former Cuban President Machado, who is living in exile in Canada... his industry in Cuba is valued at eight million US dollars. He is willing to offer assistance to anyone who can guarantee the recovery of this property for him. Another message says that the Cuban government has issued arrest warrants for Machado and thirty-eight of his former subordinates, and seized their property, which amounts to twenty-five million US dollars..."</p>
<p>With as many as thirty-eight people, and a total property of only twenty-five million US dollars, although the means cannot be said to be high, it is certainly true that they are close to getting rich.</p>
<p>If there is only one family in the world that has bedbugs, and it is pointed out by others, it is really uncomfortable, but it is really troublesome to catch them. Moreover, there is a theory in Beijing that says that bedbugs cannot be caught, the more you catch, the more there are. Even if you catch them all, what is the value? It is just a passive method. It is best to hope that other families also have bedbugs, and it would be even better if you found them. Discovery is a positive undertaking. Columbus and Edison have only made discoveries or inventions.</p>
<p>Instead of working hard and straining your mind, it is better to dance and drink coffee, which foreign countries also have. Paris has many dance halls and coffee shops.</p>
<h3>Re-discussing "Selections of Refined Literature"</h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Because of the custom of writing letters at that time, one had to describe the season and scenery in the beginning, so Xiao Tong created the "Twelve Months' Invocations" as a formula for this kind of writing. Because there were not many experts in official documents at that time, Ren Fang and Lu Chui were considered the crown of this kind of writing, so Xiao Tong compiled ancient and modern edicts and official language into a book called "Correct Preface" as a template for official documents. Because five-character poetry was the most popular poetic form at that time, Xiao Tong selected the best five-character poems and compiled them into a book called "Essence of Literary Compositions", which should actually be called "Model Poem Selections". If it is said that the Book of Songs and the Book of Documents were all selected and compiled by Confucius, then Xiao Tong can be regarded as the second Confucius. This second Confucius was also a sage of his time. The several books he selected and compiled all had a strong flavor of the times and were all fashionable things of his time. "Correct Preface" and "Essence of Literary Compositions" have not been passed down to this day, which is probably the result of the scouring of the times. Only "Selections of Refined Literature" exists to this day, and there is also a famous contemporary author, Mr. Shi Zhicun, who wants to recommend it to young people as the foundation of literary cultivation. This cannot but be regarded as the good luck of this book.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that it was Han Yu who "revived literature after eight generations of decline", but there was a scholar of "Selections" who enjoyed a high lifespan and great fame who wanted to "restore the glory of literature after eight generations." He "felt that everything was new in the past fifty years". He was tired of reading "Selections of Refined Literature", perhaps it was too old, so he reselected "Essence of Eight Generations Literature" and "Poetry Selections of Eight Generations" to teach his disciples. Sure enough, his disciples regarded these two books as treasures. We should call this group of writers the "New Selections School". Who is the founder of this school? It is Mr. Wang Xiangqi, a philosopher from my hometown who died not long ago. He almost overturned the "Old Selections School" with one kick, allowing the "New Selections School" to dominate the literary world. Unexpectedly, his grand vision was just like that of his second-generation disciple, Kang Youwei, who advocated "New Confucianism." Before the new could gain a foothold, it even overturned the old, leaving it unable to get up. Isn't this a disaster for the world?</p>
<p>I think this is really a strange thing. Mr. Shi Zhicun, such a famous modern novelist, wants to recommend "Selections of Refined Literature" to young people as the "foundation of literary cultivation". This is just like Mr. Lin Yutang advising people to read the Analects, just humor, nothing more. If there are young people who are "clumsy and straightforward" in writing and "clumsy and straightforward" in character who believe Mr. Shi's words and want to "understand a little about how to write articles" and "expand their vocabulary" from "Selections of Refined Literature," wouldn't they be betraying their own children? But on the other hand, not only should the Old Selections School feel that literature is being revived and that they are not alone, but the New Selections School may also be overjoyed, hoping to restore the glory of literature after eight generations, because they both belong to the school of selections, whether old or new, their principles are the same.</p>
<p>Although "Selections of Refined Literature" has been able to exist to this day, it naturally has its indelible qualities. Xiao Tong said:</p>
<p>Since the Ji and Han dynasties, it has been long and distant, and seven generations and more than a thousand years have passed. There are countless famous scholars and talented writers; the scrolls of flying words and writing are full of silk. If one does not extract the essence and discard the dross, it is too difficult to achieve comprehensive mastery.</p>
<p>It can be seen that "Selections of Refined Literature" is a selection of the best literature from seven generations. It contains poems, fu, and most other literary genres. It goes without saying that writers of parallel prose regard it as a treasure. Even the ancient prose writers of the Tang and Song dynasties, who looked down on the literature of the eight generations, still read it. Those below them, such as the eight-legged essay writers of the Ming and Qing dynasties, also had to learn a little about how to write articles and expand their vocabulary from "Selections of Refined Literature," so there was the saying "If you understand Selections of Refined Literature thoroughly, you are half a scholar; if you master the Four Books, you are a full scholar." Unfortunately, times have changed drastically, literature has also changed drastically, and parallel prose and ancient prose have both suffered, while vernacular literature has risen to replace them. "Selections of Refined Literature" and the "monstrous descendants of the Tongcheng School" could not withstand the magic weapons of the pioneers of the literary revolution and have long disappeared. From then on, "Selections of Refined Literature" need not be listed as required reading for young people?</p>
<h3>Talking about Masereel's Woodcut Comic Strips</h3>
<p>— Li Ping</p>
<p>I think the first time foreign woodcut comic strips were introduced to China was when Liangyou Company reprinted Masereel's works. Masereel is a famous Belgian woodcut artist. In addition to illustrating several famous works and publishing sporadic works in newspapers, he has also created several wordless comic books. The four most famous works selected and printed by Liangyou Company this time are: (1) "The Passion of a Man," (2) "The Idea," (3) "My Book of Hours," and (4) "Story Without Words". Among them, only "The Passion of a Man" and "My Book of Hours" are realistic. "The Passion of a Man" tells the story of how a worker suffers from being a wandering child until his death. Although there are only twenty or so scenes, its expression is so profound and powerful. Especially the obvious black-and-white contrast and a kind of ingenious metaphor (such as in the sixth frame where he is kicked out like a stray dog being driven away) will leave you with an indelible impression after you see it. Although "My Book of Hours" has a bit of the nature of the author's personal narrative, his experiences, thoughts, depravity, revolution, anger, and resentment towards the current society are like waves rising and falling on these hundred or so woodcuts. Some of Masereel's works are extremely bizarre and imaginative. This can be seen in "The Idea". The original name of "The Idea" was "Sun," which tells the story of a person who wants to reach the sun. He uses various methods to pursue it, but he fails everywhere. Why does the pursuer of light encounter obstacles everywhere like this? I think this is probably what the author is eager to tell us. Masereel not only has superb woodcut skills, but also has rich life experience. He can use his genius knife technique to engrave his feelings and experiences on wood. After the surrounding areas are smeared with ink, they are then reprinted on white paper. Although there are no words, after you see it, it is like reading the world's most famous literary creation. "Story Without Words" not only has good content, but also because of his genius skills, it can also express emotions that words cannot convey in this black and white picture.</p>
<h3>Missing the Mark</h3>
<p>— Feng Zhiya</p>
<p>Since my "Feeling Nostalgic" and Mr. Shi Zhicun's "Zhuangzi and Selections of Refined Literature" were published in "Free Talk," the "Torch" section of the "Great Evening News" has been soliciting further discussions. The first contribution was a letter from Mr. Shi, titled "The Recommender's Standpoint," with a note stating "The Debate on Zhuangzi and Selections of Refined Literature."</p>
<p>However, Mr. Shi is unwilling to "debate." He believes that two people fighting, like boxers under arc lights, are simply for the amusement of the audience. This is a very clever insight, and I agree with this part. But what's even more clever is that Mr. Shi isn't really standing aside. Before declaring his withdrawal, he had already thrown a few punches. After throwing them, he gracefully retreated, which is the most detached form of boxing. Now, only I am left, and I still have to respond. But it doesn't matter if there's no one on the other side; I consider myself to be performing "Free and Easy Wandering."</p>
<p>Mr. Shi begins by saying that I "instructed" him and assigned him as "a small part of the remnants of the old dynasty." The former is slanderous; I did not offer any personal advice to him in my article. As for referring to him as "a small part of the remnants of the old dynasty," that is indeed what I meant. However, my intention was that "remnants of the old dynasty" are not necessarily entirely bad people. There is no clear boundary between new and old literature, which Mr. Shi acknowledges. The Xinhai Revolution was only twenty-two years ago, so it's not surprising that people in the Republic era have some traits of the old dynasty, former officials, or even feudalism. Moreover, as Mr. Shi himself says, "Although I dare not consider myself a remnant of the old dynasty, I have indeed lost the vitality of youth." Naturally, some remnants of the past are to be expected. However, it would be better if one knew oneself, others knew, and one could transmit less of it.</p>
<p>I stated earlier that my previous writing was not specifically for him personally. After reading "Zhuangzi and Selections of Refined Literature," even this "small part" has become distant. Why? Because on the list of books recommended to young people, another extremely meaningful question is raised: one of the books is "Yan's Family Instructions." The author of "Family Instructions" lived in chaotic times, entering the Sui dynasty from Qi. It was a time when the influence of the foreign rulers was great. In that book, he discusses the classics, literature, like a Confucian scholar, yet his heart turns to Buddhism. For his children, he wants them to learn Xianbei language and play the pipa to serve noble people丨foreigners. This was also the thinking of officials, wealthy merchants, and scholars after the Boxer Rebellion: they themselves chanted Buddhist scriptures, but their children learned some "foreign affairs" so they could serve people in the future. Even now, there are probably many people who hold such thoughts. And this way of navigating the world by Yan has moved Mr. Shi and is even recommended to young people as "moral cultivation." He also mentions that he is reading a book in English and a Buddhist scripture, which is a perfect portrayal of "Xianbei language" and "turning to Buddhism." However, modern changes are rapid, lacking the leisure of the past. The conflict between the new and the old is intense, and he cannot see a clear path, so he simply combines the "morality" of the previous two generations in himself. If many young, middle-aged, and elderly people possess this Yan-style morality, it would be a serious problem in Chinese society, requiring purification. Of course, although this was prompted by the book list, the issue is not solely about an individual; it is a part of the trends of the times. However, because it is brought up in connection, it seems too closely related to a certain person's views, so I dare not discuss it. The only thing that can be related to him is "recommending people to read Zhuangzi and Selections of Refined Literature," which is probably not disrespectful to an individual. But after reading "Zhuangzi and Selections of Refined Literature," I did develop a little disrespect because his refutation was even more empty than I had anticipated, but I still gave a serious response, which is "After Feeling Nostalgic."</p>

<h3>Two Brothers (6)</h3>
<p>— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Mrs. Roland was a forty-eight-year-old woman who did not look her age. She seemed happier than anyone else about this boat trip and the beautiful sunset.</p>
<p>Her brown hair was only just beginning to turn white. She had a calm and rational face, a happy and pleasant face. According to her son Pierre, she knew the value of money, but this did not prevent her from enjoying the flavor of dreams. She liked to read novels and poems, not for their artistic value, but because they aroused some melancholy and gentle contemplation in her. According to her, a line of poetry, often an ordinary and bad line, would make the small strings of her heart tremble, and she felt as if she had almost realized a mysterious wish. She was happy to indulge in these slight emotions, these emotions that slightly disturbed her organized mind, which was like a ledger.</p>
<p>Since she came to Havre, she had noticeably gained weight, and her formerly very slender and graceful figure had gradually become more substantial.</p>
<p>This boat trip made her very happy. Her husband was not a bad person, but he mistreated her just as the tyrants in those small shops mistreat others without anger or hatred. For these tyrants, command is equivalent to swearing. In front of strangers, he was reserved, but at home, he let himself go and displayed all sorts of frightening appearances, although he was actually afraid of everyone. She, because she was most afraid of quarrels and useless explanations, always gave in and never made any demands. Therefore, for a long time, she dared not ask Roland to take her out to sea for a stroll. So she seized this opportunity with great joy, and she enjoyed this rare new pleasure.</p>
<p>From the moment she set off, she immersed her whole being, both mentally and physically, in this gentle glide on the water. She thought of nothing, banished all memories and hopes. She felt that her heart, like her body, was floating on something soft, flowing, and wonderful, which rocked her and made her feel faint.</p>
<p>When her father ordered the return trip, saying, "Hey, sit in the rowing seats!" she smiled and looked at her children, her two big boys, who took off their clothes and rolled up the sleeves of their shirts on their bare arms.</p>
<p>Pierre, sitting close to the two women, grabbed the oar on the right, and Jean grabbed the oar on the left. They waited for the master to shout, "Forward together!" because, according to the master's wishes, the action of rowing the boat had to be executed regularly.</p>
<p>With the same effort, they both plunged their oars into the water and then leaned back and tried their best to pull the oars forward. Thus, to show their energy, a struggle began. They had come slowly under sail, but now the wind had died down, and the two brothers' masculine pride had suddenly awakened, wanting to compete for superiority.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Advancing by Straddling</h3>
<p>— Wenbing</p>
<p>Not long ago, I published an article called "On Straddling" in this publication, with a preview of a candidate for "Advancing by Straddling." This article is my fulfillment of that promise.</p>
<p>The previous article had these sentences: "Even so, sometimes things go wrong, because ultimately, straddling both sides requires effort, and if your feet cramp up and your straddling skills are fully developed, you will inevitably fall." Because of this, it is not something that can be achieved in one leap; it requires a great deal of cultivation, which means straddling has its own stages of advancement.</p>
<p>But then again, although straddling has become a widespread philosophy of life, it is not something that everyone can imitate. That is to say, foolish people can hardly imitate it effectively. To straddle, although you don't need innate beauty, you do need to be extremely clever, as agile as a monkey, as insightful as a cat's eyes at night, as cunning and keen-eared as a rat, as good at jumping as a spotted dog. In short, you must be exceptionally clever to have a chance to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about advancing:</p>
<p>First, you must not forget the most important premise of life: the pursuit of profit and desire. A person is busy all the time, wanting nothing more than to earn a few silver dollars. In this age of possession, money is power. With silver dollars in hand, life will be surrounded by countless flowers. Life is short, so logically, you should enjoy it. So, profit and desire are the first priority, simply put, it means you should first consider silver dollars. Various ways of enjoying yourself that follow silver dollars, such as holding women and riding in cars, are too involved, so let's "hold back" on those for now.</p>
<p>Secondly, you also need real skills, but this does not refer to some kind of academic knowledge. Rather, it means having a precise and far-sighted vision, clearly understanding the trends, and seeing the world thoroughly. Don't be too advanced, and don't be too backward. You must be far-sighted and adapt to changing circumstances. For example, at a certain time, Mr. X can mobilize a group of blind masses and become very popular. You must observe that this is the era of Mr. X, so you can step on one foot. At the same time, Mr. X's new medicine is also being advertised. If you can accurately predict that there will be a sensational period, you must also make a thorough estimate, like Master Kongming, and your actions can follow Mr. X's new call to action. Therefore, your vision must be precise and far-sighted.</p>
<p>To go one step further, you need to put on a "Jia Guan dance" mask, a convoluted brain. Such an argument will show that you are capable and loyal. Then, with a flip of the face, you can still show that you are capable and loyal. When you fall into a bandit's den, you say that this is the only way out for poor people. When you sit high on the altar of justice, you say that bandits deserve to die. You can say one set of principles and another set of right and wrong. Your mouth is like a phonograph, playing a popular love song and then a Buddhist scripture. In short, you need to be fake when you need to be fake, able to cry and able to laugh, but when changing course, be careful of flaws, although it doesn't really matter. In this way, your feet will naturally step steadily.</p>
<p>In addition, you also need general flattery and boasting. When you meet someone above you, flatter them tightly; when you meet someone below you, boast recklessly. This is an old trick, a cliché, so there's no need to elaborate.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to add two kinds of counter-measures: first, the most taboo thing is so-called "integrity," which was valued by people in the past but is now considered wrong. Don't be stubborn about any bird's opinions or bird's personality. Opinions and personality are so empty and abstract. You can use your great future to resist it, and see if it will be irresistible and swept away. Second, the most taboo thing is so-called "conscience." This is also a useless term. You don't need to consider so much. As long as you can use any means and achieve your goals, whether you straddle east or straddle west, whether you kill or set fire, it's all considered done.</p>
<p>My sleepless head is throbbing with pain. I light a cigarette and look at the clock. It's already five o'clock in the morning. The train at the North Station has started its loud morning whistle. "Advancing by Straddling" is complete.</p>

<h3>Expectation</h3>
<p>— Shaoyuan</p>
<p>It was gloomy weather, as if it wanted to rain. All of nature was immersed in the gray embrace of the universe.</p>
<p>He stared blankly out the window, sitting on a rattan chair, his hands placed apart on either side, devoutly in silence.</p>
<p>丨丨Um丨That sound on the stairs, I'm afraid it's her. He tilted his head, listening to the sound of footsteps climbing the stairs below.</p>
<p>However, it only made him anxious and disappointed. Each time the sound of footsteps, either stopped on the second floor or ran straight up to the fourth floor.</p>
<p>丨丨Tch丨This one isn't it丨That one isn't it丨</p>
<p>He stood up and paced in a circle. Looking around the room, the decor was so modern and artistic. What made him especially happy were the two fresh flowers placed on the table, emitting a fragrant scent, so well-paired. He longed for them to be a symbol of him and her in the future. He smiled and raised his eyebrows at the two beautiful flowers.</p>
<p>Tap, tap, tap! The sound of footsteps below rang out again. He quietly turned his head to watch the movements of the door. In the end, it was the servant girl running up to the balcony. He hated her, wishing he could kill her. Why was she always running up and down like this?</p>
<p>丨丨Could it be that she broke the appointment? Or perhaps she forgot? No, no, she would absolutely not break the appointment or forget. I even received a letter from her yesterday! Maybe her class hasn't ended? Maybe she's being held back by her female companions? Maybe she's on the way right now? Maybe...</p>
<p>His thoughts surged like waves.</p>
<p>He paced in circles again. Five minutes passed, and still no sign of anyone. He peeked out the window. He only saw strangers coming and going in twos and threes in the alley below. He turned his head again and looked at the clock on the desk. It was already pointing to 5:35. He suspected that the clock was running too fast and was inaccurate. However, the light outside the window seemed to be gradually dimming. Twilight enveloped the entire earth.</p>
<p>He was anxious. He couldn't wait any longer. He wanted to run to the school to make a phone call. What exactly was going on?</p>
<p>"Hello! Who are you looking for?"</p>
<p>"Looking for Miss XXX."</p>
<p>"Okay! Please wait a moment!"</p>
<p>"Um!"</p>
<p>His heart was full of anticipation in that moment.</p>
<p>"Hello丨Miss XXX has gone out!"</p>
<p>As if heaven had struck with thunder, he was stunned. He hung up the phone and walked out of the school gate dejectedly. 丨丨Maybe she's already waiting for me at my house!</p>
<p>A kind of hope sprang up again. He rushed home, first asking below, then running straight up to the room. He pushed open the door, and a kind of stuffy smell and the emptiness of hope filled him...</p>
<p>Outside the window it was getting darker and darker! The dim street lights shone in faintly, and in the distance came the sound of factory whistles, the sound of buying newspapers...</p>
<p>Night of September 29, 1933,</p>
<h3>Three Stages in a Dream</h3>
<p>— Shibeng</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to Shanghai and saw "Aviation Lottery 500,000 Yuan" everywhere on the road, east and west. It made me feel dizzy and disoriented. I was planning to have lunch, but I ran into a place that sells paper offerings to the dead. I was just obsessed with wealth. That night I had a dream.</p>
<p>I dreamed that the "606" aviation lottery ticket I bought had won the first prize. I went to the Central Bank to collect the prize money of 500,000 yuan. When I returned home, I was overjoyed. Not only did my old mother and beloved wife greet me with smiles, but the bank also sent four soldiers who always made me feel a little scared when I saw them. They were carrying box cannons and driving a new 1933 "Chevrolet" car to escort me back to my residence. Along the way, the people watching were a sea of faces, all praising my great fortune. It made my face glow with pride. It was truly the first time in my life that I had experienced such happiness, glory, prominence, extravagance, and triumph.</p>
<p>Once I had money, all the high-ranking relatives and nobles who used to avoid me as if I were a plague came to visit me uninvited. What made me most pleasantly surprised was that Miss Jin Ai, a lover who had broken up with me three years ago because I didn't buy her a diamond ring, also came all the way from Nanjing, dressed in gorgeous clothes, to celebrate with me. She also brought many valuable items that I couldn't name. She kindly asked about my health over the past three years. I apologized to her for making her angry and leave because I didn't buy her a diamond ring before. Her two tempting, intoxicating, charming dimples smiled gently at me again, and my body was so intoxicated that I couldn't control myself. I suddenly stepped forward, hugged her, and gave her a sweet kiss. At this time, the warm dream of three years ago quickly appeared in my mind. That day, seeing the constant stream of relatives and friends, I felt that my house was too shabby and all the utensils were too shabby. Not only was I sorry for these noble relatives and friends, but it also felt too undignified for me, who was now a 500,000-yuan millionaire. So I immediately entrusted a relative who was a real estate company manager to build me a exquisite small Western-style house. He also took care of all the teak utensils and copper beds and silk quilts for me 丨 I didn't have to worry about it at all. That's how enthusiastic he was. Xiao Zhang was good at catering to people's wishes and even found three beautiful concubines for me. On the day I moved to the new residence, it was full of guests, the music was loud, and my beloved wife and beautiful concubines nervously surrounded me, allowing me to enjoy all the happiness in life. I was so happy that I couldn't close my mouth.</p>
<p>First, because relatives and friends advised me that the world was not good now and that kidnappings were rampant, so I had to be extra careful when going out; second, because of my round-faced millionaire status, I naturally had to act more important, so I bought a brand-new car to travel in. Who knew that my beloved wife and beautiful concubines, hugging left and right, would attract the attention of kidnappers while driving for pleasure. Late at night on X day, my third concubine and I had just returned from the XX dance hall after dancing. When the car passed XX Road, three fierce-looking brothers suddenly jumped out from the roadside, pulled out their guns, and stole the car. They took us to the bandits' lair. The bandits forced me to write a letter demanding 500,000 yuan for ransom. I thought I had only just won the first prize and suddenly become rich, but now I was forced to hand over everything. My Western-style house and beautiful concubines would vanish once again, and I would still be a poor man. Then, wouldn't the 500,000 yuan be just a fool's dream? So I stubbornly refused. Who knew that they were aiming their guns at me? If I didn't comply, my life would be in danger. So, in a moment of anxiety and fright, I suddenly woke up and realized it was just a dream.</p>
<h3>"How to Be a Person"</h3>
<p>— Congyun</p>
<p>"How to Be a Person"? In other words, "How to Survive in the Times"? Indeed, living in this era, if you don't understand some of the ways to be a "person," you'll never be successful in your life. But this refers to "people above people," people below "ordinary people" are exceptions!</p>
<p>Does this mean that "being a person" is the most difficult thing? No, as long as you have the thick skin to do it, there will be a day when you succeed. But how do you get that thick skin? It's not difficult, just follow in their footsteps and act accordingly, and I guarantee you'll get it!</p>
<p>Women 丨丨 are worshipped by the world, no matter what era it is. However, in this era, 　　 era.</p>
<p>From ancient times to the present, 　　 son, a demon king who kills without blinking an eye, will be helplessly intoxicated as soon as he comes into their presence, into their hands! What tricks are they playing? To put it definitively, precisely, and accurately, isn't it the policy of controlling others? When you are unhappy and discouraged, she comes to flatter you for a moment, and when you are spirited and happy, she delays again. At this time, aren't you already in her circle? At this time, she has won! She uses an attitude of neither approaching nor leaving to determine your consciousness. This can be considered a policy of iron fists! Isn't it the same in the international arena? Neither close nor distant. But too 　 all 　 some.</p>
<p>If you learn this strategy for "being a person," it will be good 丨 when you meet a rigid boss who is simply unreasonable, you can follow this method and act accordingly. Serve him in every possible way, bow your head and lower your voice, even more filial than a son. When he shows you a little kindness, you can have some demands. At least you have the right to speak. At this time, if you are ruthless, no, if you are clever, you can slander that person for a moment, or you may even have a chance to be a candidate. If you exceptionally become his trusted follower, that would be even better!</p>
<p>This is still a "　　" strategy. There is also a "timely" strategy, which is also very important. To take women as an example again 丨丨 a clever woman, a thorough woman, feels the lack of flesh, so she generously sacrifices it to be viewed by the public. She also applies beautiful makeup, all artificial beauty. In this way, is she still afraid that people won't pay attention to her? That's enough, as long as someone pays attention to her, she has something to show! What's there to be afraid of once there is development?</p>
<p>"Being a person" is the same. Do it in a special way, do it thoroughly. See where there is a hole, and work hard to operate there. "　"　 is　 a little 　 also 　　　　 For example, say: that official's concubine died. If you have a beautiful wife, sister, or even a small relative, you must quickly present her. Be quick, because there are many candidates! Otherwise, someone else will get there first! Doing this may be ridiculed, but it doesn't matter. Isn't he thinking of doing this, but he just lacks the path to "being a person"!</p>
<p>If you can be a person, a person among people, more people will pay attention to you. When people pay attention to you, you will also 　 woman generally have development. Once you have development, come.</p>

<h3>The Explorer of the Dark Road</h3>
<p>— Rong Zi</p>
<p>In fact, I must admit: I have lived a life of groping in the dark for over twenty years. Even now, all that lies before me is a chaotic darkness. Although this has struck me so deeply that it has forced me to abandon my ambitions, forget my dreams, curse life, doubt life, and even want to escape life! But occasionally, like embers rekindling, I have repeatedly mustered my last bit of courage, struggling to seek the light. Sometimes, I have even frantically stumbled through the mountains and forests, only to end up with a swollen head, unable to break out of this seemingly impenetrable circle of darkness and deathly fog! I wonder: Is it my destiny to be a slave, whipped throughout my life, and quietly drift toward death?</p>
<p>My aunt came from Nanjing and spoke of Shi Jie, who shared the same fate as me for several years. Unable to bear the scourges and torments of his environment, and deeply mired in a hopeless situation, he committed suicide at the Swallow Rock, throwing himself into the surging torrent!</p>
<p>Shi Jie—mentioning this familiar name evokes an image of a man with a resolute and profound face, a sturdy and tall figure in my mind. On this figure's face, there are thick, broad eyebrows, and wrinkles that trace countless curves, etched by wind, frost, and torment. There are also thick lips, a flat nose, a lean, long face, and deep-set eyes... All of these reappear before my eyes, one by one. In particular, his diligence, loyalty, and sincerity are engraved in my heart and can never be erased or forgotten. Two years ago, he came from a bankrupt countryside, with an empty stomach, to Shanghai in search of food—wasn't this a dream? Was Shanghai a place for poor children, especially one who was not cunning, treacherous, opportunistic, or deceitful? However, a full year of wandering, although it had left his stomach even more empty and shriveled, had strengthened his will to survive and his courage. So he resolutely left Shanghai for Guangdong with great ambition. But unfortunately, things always happen unexpectedly. At that time, XXX and XXX were at war, and everything was in a chaotic state. He ran around aimlessly for three months, only to dejectedly return to Shanghai. After that, his life was like a wild horse without reins. Without purpose or determination, he returned to his hometown, went to Guangdong again, then to Hunan, back to Shanghai, then to Jiangxi, and finally drifted to our capital, Nanjing. He spent two years rushing through the darkness accomplishing nothing, and finally buried his exhausted body in the flood. Alas, Shi Jie, a tragic victim on the dark road!</p>
<p>At first, I was doubtful: Are those who are not cunning, treacherous, opportunistic, or deceitful destined to grope in the dark for their entire lives, ultimately meeting a tragic end? The answer, of course, seemed to be yes. But Shi Jie's tragic death inspired me not only to cast aside my past depression and reclaim my lost will to survive and courage, but also to understand that in this era, under this dog-eat-dog social system, it is inevitable that people like Shi Jie and I are driven onto the dark road. However, Shi Jie's final act shows that he was a weakling without promise. Hopelessness is certainly painful, but to die in confusion because of hopelessness is foolish! Does death mean the dark road has been traversed, and the light has been found? Of course not. We should first find the reasons for our hopelessness, analyze them systematically, and finally, understand the great responsibility we bear to save ourselves and others, and relentlessly and diligently move forward. Only then, on this long and dim dark road, can the explorers of the dark road use their own ability and strength to build a solid, tall lighthouse that will forever illuminate the entire world!</p>
<p>"Is it my destiny to be a slave, whipped throughout my life, and quietly drift toward death?" My friends, explorers of the dark road, this is a lie! We are treading on thorns, but as long as we are careful of the pits beneath our feet, and we hold hands, we should earnestly save ourselves and others!</p>
<h3>Cigarettes and Lovers</h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>I have unfortunately become friends with cigarettes, unable to be without them for a moment. When I am tired from work, they can make me feel energized. Although I knew even when I was in elementary school that cigarettes contain terrible nicotine that can harm my health, I simply cannot sever my ties with them.</p>
<p>Cigarettes are my friends, but cigarettes are my lover's enemy. She once ordered me in a letter to immediately break up with cigarettes. She warned me that cigarettes are not good for me, and she even said, "...If you don't do as I say, I will break up with you forever."</p>
<p>I was in a very difficult situation. The night I received her letter, I pondered it all night. Conflicting thoughts battled in my mind.</p>
<p>According to the words of the sage Mencius, "Cigarettes, I desire them; my lover, I also desire her. But I cannot have both..." I could not decide what to do. Should I give up my lover for cigarettes, or should I give up cigarettes for my lover?</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to give up cigarettes. I painfully broke up with cigarettes, whom I had known for four or five years.</p>
<p>After I started quitting, I felt unspeakably sad. My chest felt heavy, especially after meals and bowel movements. I couldn't work as energetically or quickly as before. Even more terrible was the temptation of my father smoking. I often stood next to him, inhaling the blue smoke that he exhaled. Several times, I put a cigarette between my lips, but I always took it away, fearing that I would upset my lover. Since I broke up with cigarettes, I felt like I had fallen into a land of suffering.</p>
<p>I couldn't resist its temptation, I couldn't bear the pain, and finally, I became a weak-willed fellow, deeply apologized to cigarettes, and rekindled our relationship. This is not a shameful thing. A country can break up with another country and then restore relations. How much more so me!</p>
<p>But my lover has ignored me ever since. She thinks I am a rogue. Without cigarettes, I suffer. Without a lover, I am lonely. I am controlled by these two things! Away with the pain, and here comes the loneliness; away with the loneliness, and here comes the pain! Should I suffer physical pain, or should I suffer spiritual loneliness?</p>
<p>At least, I can have one of them.</p>
<p>Drama</p>
<h3>War and Peace (May First) (A Play in Four Acts)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Act Three: Ode to Peace</p>
<p>Elder: But, Master Zhou, his family is really poor. Plus, with the war like this, what can you expect him to use to pay the grain tax? Please say a few good words to the magistrate, Master Zhou, and let him delay the payment for a few months, until the harvest season.</p>
<p>Village Chief: That won't do. Grain tax is a national levy. How can you just delay it? As for my thirteen dollars, I know he's a pauper, so I can wait another month. But he has to pay me back, even if he has to sell his sister.</p>
<p>Middle-Aged Woman: Please have mercy, Master Zhou (kneeling). Spare my old life... Because of this war, our family is really too poor to eat. We will repay you in the future, even if we become oxen or horses.</p>
<p>Village Chief: Now we are collecting imperial grain and national taxes, and there's no room for sentimentality. You have to understand that the government needs a lot of money for the war, and now that peace has begun, we need even more money to implement national reconstruction. The government can't become thieves and robbers, so if you don't pay your taxes, how can we talk about reconstruction, how can we buy planes to save the country? As for my money, with principal and interest, calculated at three percent, three times three is nine, three times nine is twenty-seven, so this month you owe seventeen dollars. What are you going to pay with? But next month, it will be seventeen dollars and fifty cents... Originally, if your monk was a law-abiding person, I might have been able to cover this grain tax for you, but he is usually too aggressive, colluding with the enemy, willingly becoming a traitor.

<p>Young Man B: But we know the monk is not a traitor.</p>
<p>Village Chief: What? You know? Bah! Don't you think I know?</p>
<p>Security Team Member A: No matter what, let's take this old woman and the young girl away first.</p>
<p>Young Girl: Mom! We don't want to go.</p>
<p>Middle-Aged Woman: Master Zhou, please!</p>
<p>Village Chief: No, I can't control that. You hand over your son.</p>
<p>Elder: Heavens, how can you ask her to hand him over? He's hiding and can't be found. What can she do? You're being completely unreasonable.</p>
<p>Village Chief: What? Who are you saying is being unreasonable?</p>
<p>Security Team Member B: Then let's take this old fellow away too.</p>
<p>Elder: Go ahead, I haven't broken any law, what am I afraid of? I'm already so old, kill me if you want!...</p>

<p>Elder: Oh! You've come... Ah! It's a dark and chaotic world. I only spoke a word of fairness, and now they're taking me away too.</p>
<p>Child: (The one from Act One) Grandpa, don't go, don't go!</p>
<p>Middle-Aged Woman B: No, no, that won't do. If you go, what will we do with the children?</p>
<p>Elder: Oh! Yes, how can I go, what will happen to these two grandchildren? (Picks up the child) Their father went to carry loads for the soldiers, and hasn't come back yet. How can I go? Oh! I can't go, I can't just let them starve to death, can I?</p>
<p>Security Team Member B: (Pulling him) Never mind all that, go! (The child cries in fright).</p>

<h3>On the Management of Large Cinemas (Part 1) Experiences of a London Cinema Manager</h3>
<p>— Shen Weng</p>
<p>The success of a cinema's business and the satisfaction of its audience are closely related to the cinema's manager. H.W. Crull, manager of the London Empire Theatre, one of the most luxurious cinemas in London's West End, recently published an article on cinema management in a British film publication. I am now translating it below so that readers may know that managing a cinema is indeed an interesting but also a very troublesome job.</p>
<p>To most of the audience, the cinema manager is just someone who wears neat clothes, stands in the lobby, sometimes bows to the distinguished audience, and sometimes waves his arms to direct the ushers. He looks very well-dressed, but what exactly does he do? In short, he is there to serve the audience, making sure that each of them is comfortable and satisfied. In my cinema, the audience ranges from 50,000 to 100,000 people every week, so I am responsible for satisfying so many customers. Like many large cinema managers, my working hours are usually fourteen hours a day.</p>
<p>Let me first tell you about the daily work of a large cinema manager. He arrives at the cinema at nine in the morning and inspects the entire building before the first show. He must inspect whether the lights are damaged. He must check the seats, carpets, and walls for signs of shoddy work. The cleaning crew comes to clean from midnight to five o'clock in the morning. When it is almost ten o'clock, he must also go outside to supervise the opening of the first show (i.e., the morning show). After the show starts, he must pay attention to the sound and light. If there is anything that is not suitable, he must go to the projection room to correct it. When everything is on the right track, he will give the audience a final look before returning to his office.</p>
<p>There are already many emails waiting for him there. A large cinema manager receives hundreds of letters from customers every week. The first one suggests a new tune for the pianist to play during breaks. The second one says that he dropped a pair of gloves in the cinema. The third one complains about a man who was smoking a cigar next to her. In short, many letters contain good advice, which the manager of course welcomes. After he has read these many letters, there are still many things to follow. It is not until lunchtime that he can finish writing replies and handling daily affairs. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Floating Petals"</h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>"Floating Petals" is a film by Tianyi Film Company, following "Flying Catkins." Because "Flying Catkins" left a good impression on people, there were considerable hopes when watching "Floating Petals." In particular, there is a need for us to get to know director Tang Xiaodan.</p>
<p>The story of "Floating Petals" is about "Xiu Zhen from Flying Catkins, who, because of her husband's death and the dismissal of her father-in-law from his position as village security chief, is scolded by her mother-in-law as a jinx. Furthermore, because the rich man Hu Fubao wants to take her as a concubine, she secretly escapes to the city to work as a maid, but the master makes excuses to dismiss her. Therefore, she and her companion Liu Qing go to work as factory workers. Later, she meets the young Ding Zhenping, and they fall in love at first sight, and live together. However, Ding is expelled from school because of this and is confined to his home. Xiu Zhen is pressed for rent by the landlord and has no way to pay. So, on a stormy night, she leaves while ill. Fortunately, Liu Qing helps her back to her humble home. When Ding arrives, she only utters her last lament and dies." Because the story is simple, the plot of "Floating Petals" (in the explanation) takes the form of a poem, ending with the following sentences: "Flying Catkins, Floating Petals! Her fate, why is it so cruel? To sum it up, it is caused by the evil society!"</p>
<p>Originally, "Flying Catkins" presented a fairly realistic picture of the Chinese countryside. Even at the beginning of "Floating Petals," when Xiu Zhen's husband dies and her father-in-law is dismissed, leading to her mother-in-law's venomous scolding, the so-called "wife killer" and "family destroyer" were very common phrases in the mouths of people in the Chinese countryside, where feudal remnants were strong. Chinese women have sacrificed so many lives and suffered so much misery due to this absurd superstition. The author's grasp of this point is indeed quite appropriate. But unfortunately, this part of the story is only mentioned in the subtitles, and not seen at all on screen. On the other hand, the cliché of the local tyrant forcing marriage, which has become a formula for Chinese films, is written in detail. This is determined by the author's method of creation! There is no forcing it!</p>
<p>Even when Xiu Zhen and Liu Qing go to work, there is no mention of the workers' suffering or the factory's oppression. Instead, Xiu Zhen is inexplicably written as meeting Ding Zhenping and living with him. If it weren't for the school expulsion and the family's prohibition, Xiu Zhen would have become Mrs. Ding in Liu Zhen's eyes. May I ask, is being "Mrs. Ding" Xiu Zhen's way out? Is it the way out for all female workers? The author focuses on inserting the feudal relatives of the Ding family and exposing the remnants of feudalism, while neglecting other more important things! This is a major flaw in the story and the direction!</p>
<p>As for the minor shortcomings in the direction:</p>
<p>First, Master Fu giving Xiu Zhen a ring is too casual. It seems that Master Fu had already prepared the ring and kept it on his person, without any prior indication.</p>
<p>Second, since Xiu Zhen is working as a maid in the Fu family, how could she leave immediately when the matchmaker Gao's family called, without even telling the master? This is unreasonable, especially since she is a maid that Master Fu has taken an interest in.</p>
<p>Third, Ding Zhenping's letter to Xiu Zhen is seen by his father, but this letter has very little relation to the story. And Xiu Zhen's letter to Ding Zhenping, we neither see Xiu Zhen writing it, nor see her sending it, nor see it arriving at the Ding family and being confiscated by Ding Zhenping's father. It is only mentioned in the subtitles, which is not enough.</p>
<p>Fourth, Ding Zhenping's father tells the servants not to allow Ding Zhenping to go out and to confiscate his letters! Sure enough, the servants present Ding's letter to Xiu Zhen to him. But when Ding Zhenping finally goes to see Xiu Zhen, he goes by car. Why is it that when he tells the servants not to tell the master, the servants don't tell him?</p>
<p>Fifth, Xiu Zhen waits for the bus several times, and there are too few pedestrians on the road, even none at all, which is also incorrect.</p>
<p>In addition, the director has Xiu Zhen planting a flower at home while she is working, watering it every day, especially on the day she meets Ding, she waters it even more vigorously. Later, on a stormy night, the flower is broken by the wind and rain before Xiu Zhen dies. This method of "symbolism" is commendable, but a female worker is unlikely to have the leisure to grow flowers, is she?</p>
<p>As for the performances, Hu Shan replaces Yuan Meiyun's role in "Flying Catkins," but she is far inferior to Yuan Meiyun. Ma Loufen is not good enough, and there are no other good points either!</p>
<p>In short, in "Flying Catkins," Tianyi Film Company used a suspenseful method to get people to see the results in "Floating Petals." Now, the result we see in "Floating Petals" is "Disillusionment." This "Disillusionment" is not accidental, because it did not recognize the inevitable future! Therefore, Xiu Zhen's inability to recognize the future is of course due to the producers' inability to recognize the future.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Calendar"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The Calendar</p>
<p>After watching this work, I think someone will definitely say, "This is very dull." Indeed, this is the main drawback.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, silent performances are not necessarily a bad method. If the play can pay good attention to inner performances, and if the entire play can grasp the mood of stillness, like Georgia Lis's "Philanthropy" and Ann Harding's "The Age of Innocence." In these films, we don't have to see pointless gimmicks or fierce fighting. On the contrary, we are gripped by that kind of quiet power, and every scene makes us blend in with the emotions of the people in the play. Therefore, we do not have a dull feeling.</p>
<p>However, the silent performance here is a failure. No matter whether it has loose dialogue or ridiculous actions. This alone proves the director's lack of ability. He tries his best to make the plot interesting, but the effect is the opposite.</p>
<p>However, the main thing is the mediocrity of the story. Under such a vulgar story, a good result cannot be obtained naturally. Even if the director cleverly changes a certain method of performance, it is not certain that it will make people have a great taste. Moreover, there is no possibility of inserting some dancing or sensuality at all. The only thing that is possible is a small amount of barely stimulating occasions. Otherwise, like ordinary American films, it is not impossible to take advantage of the thighs and breasts to make a big show. Of course, we are not saying that we are disappointed because it is not sensual enough. On the contrary, we are saying that the author has no way to come up with a set of crazy stunts.</p>
<p>As for what the story is about, I think anyone who has had a lot of contact with European and American films will definitely be able to imagine it. Isn't it the same old story of talented men and beautiful women falling in love at first sight? However, good things often take a lot of effort, and there is bound to be jealousy and suspicion. In the end, lovers will definitely have a happy ending. Regardless of whether this is a racetrack boy falling in love with the Duke's daughter, regardless of whether there is a distinction between nobility and inferiority between a commoner and a lady, regardless of how disparate their economic situations are, in the end, these obstacles are eliminated, and they can give the best explanation of the doctrine of love above all else. In fact, love is by no means something that transcends everything. In any case, the power of economics has long determined the love of all kinds of people. Only declining art deceives itself and insists on the theory that love is supreme. Naturally, this is not without purpose, but there is no need to elaborate here.</p>
<p>As for the actors, the Duke is quite outstanding. At least he did not relax the identity of the people in the play.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>The So-Called "Cuckoo's Song in an Ancient Temple"</h3>
<p>— Yin Zhong</p>
<p>When the tide of revolution surges to its peak, it is followed by a wave of reaction. Similarly, when the film industry has changed direction and is continuing to move forward, it is also followed by the act of reversing the trend. And this kind of behavior in the film industry is expressed by the transformers themselves. This is really a pity!</p>
<p>Isn't Lianhua Film Company the most progressive in our country's film industry? And its act of reversing the trend is also the most outstanding. If you don't believe me, please take a look at "Cuckoo's Song in an Ancient Temple," which is currently being screened at the Beijing Theater!</p>
<p>After watching this film, it's like watching "The Book of Supreme Inducement." The whole story is a kind of "good begets good, and evil begets evil" "record of cause and effect" from beginning to end. Undoubtedly, it is preaching for "ghosts and gods" and promoting superstitious thinking! In fact, the superstitious toxins in the minds of our people are already harmful enough. Why bother to promote it?</p>
<p>However, this film can still attract some audiences. This is undoubtedly because there are still those who need it. These are the so-called "devout men and women" who can use this film as a good tool for propagating "retribution." If the film company officials had not seen through this point, would they be willing to spend their efforts to manufacture it?</p>
<h3>Newsreel of the National Games Opens</h3>
<p>At the National Games held in the capital this time, Tianyi, Lianhua, and Mingxing all sent photography teams to Beijing to take newsreels. Now, the newsreel taken by Tianyi is being shown at the Beijing Theater in this city. The wonderful programs in the meeting, such as various men's and women's track and field events, swimming, martial arts, football, basketball, tennis, volleyball, etc., are all available. Men and women athletes, such as Qian Hangsu, Liu Changchun, Hao Chunde, Wang Jihuai, Fu Baolu, Sun Guiyun, Ma Ji, Lin Baohua, Shi Xingzhi, Chen Rongming, Lin Shaozhou, Zhang Jieqiong, etc., are also all included in the lens. There are also athletes visiting the Mausoleum of Sun Yat-sen, and the triumphal return to Shanghai by male and female athletes from Shanghai the other day, the city government's banquet, and the car parade, etc., which are particularly wonderful. It is said that the Guanghua, Donghai, New Central, and Enpaiya theaters also have newsreels of the National Games being shown. The one shown in Guanghua is said to be produced by Lianhua Film Company.</p>
<h3>The Film Novel "Peach and Plum in Fragrance" Paddy the Next Best Thing (1) Produced by 20th Century Fox, starring Janet Gaynor and Warner Baxter</h3>
<p>— Xing Sheng</p>
<p>The tranquility of the seaside scenery in Ireland is truly unsurpassed. The color of the sea stretches to the horizon. Suddenly, a yacht appears in the distance, its sails catching the wind as it enters the harbor. Once the yacht drops anchor, two people climb down from the ship and into a small sampan, rowing towards the shore, cutting through the waves. The two men are talking in the sampan. One of them, named Schreiber, seems to be a melancholy person. He is blaming his companion, saying, "If you must use marriage as a pastime because you have nothing else to do, that's one thing. But for you to abandon your own career and travel all the way from Ceylon to propose to a woman you haven't seen in years, I find it truly inexplicable." The other man, named Blake, has a very romantic appearance. He says, "I am already immersed in love, but I haven't proposed to her yet." Schreiber says, "Then you can rest assured, this matter is almost certain to succeed."</p>
<p>Suddenly, they see a small boat capsized in the distance, with what appears to be a woman on top. They turn the boat around and row towards the overturned vessel. When they get closer, they find something strange: although the girl's boat is overturned, she is clinging to the side with one hand and eating an apple with the other. Blake approaches and asks, "Hey, what are you doing there?" She says, "My boat capsized, and I didn't have any breakfast. All I have left is this apple." They pull her onto the sampan. Once ashore, she jumps away.</p>
<p>After the girl leaves, Blake asks the fisherman nearby, "Who is that girl? Does she live here?" The fisherman says, "That's Paddy, Miss Adair. She lives here." Blake exclaims, "Could she be Eileen, Miss Adair's sister?" The fisherman says, "Yes, exactly." Blake turns to Schreiber and says, "The one we just rescued is probably my future sister-in-law." So they first call Captain Adair.</p>
<p>Blake's phone call couldn't have come at a better time. He calls when the Captain is in dire straits, besieged by a group of creditors. They are noisily protesting, "If we can't think of another solution, we'll have to resort to drastic measures within a month." Captain Adair goes to answer the phone. He returns from the phone with great excitement and says to the creditors, "Alright, alright, you can rest assured. My daughter's fiancé just called. My daughter's fiancé is Lawrence Blake. Once my daughter marries Blake, I will not owe you half a penny. Alright, goodbye." He bows and hustles the creditors away.</p>
<p>"Perhaps this marriage deal has some hope," says one creditor. "Don't listen to that old fox. He specializes in deceiving people. He used to say that his uncle from Austra-Venetia died and left him an inheritance. Who knew there wasn't even a place called Austra-Venetia on earth; he doesn't even have an uncle, he only has an aunt! (To be continued)</p>
