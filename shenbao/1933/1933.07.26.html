<p>地理學者張其昀君最近在上海講演國防敎育。其演詞中言及國防之四要點。（一）應爲國民的而不應爲軍人的。（二）應爲養生的而不應爲送死的。（三）應爲攻勢而不應徒爲守勢。（四）應有精神而不應只有物質。張君此次之講演。係對聽講之中小學敎員談國防之敎育。與軍事上之國防論不同。故所言如此。吾人則因張君之言。引起討論國防問題之興趣。特藉此闡明國家境界在國防上之關係。</p>
<p>何謂國防。簡單説明之。即國家因領土之保安。而施以戰略的守勢防禦之謂也。準此以言。則國防之基本。爲國家之領土。種種防禦方法及設備。不過保安領土之計劃耳。一國之領土與他國之領土間。必有境界線。此境界線。在吾中國陸路長二萬八千餘里。海岸長約一萬六千餘里。對此四萬四千餘里之國境及其距地面一萬公尺之天空。布置陸海空軍及各種軍事設備爲軍事上之國防。訓練國民。使國防能力。得以充分發揮。爲國防之敎育。</p>
<p>中國國防之第一困難問題。爲國家境界之未能確保。換言之。即國家權力未能及於全部國境也。以前在東北有所謂間島問題。在西南有片馬江心坡之糾紛。在南部領海。有西沙羣島事件。今則東北四省。全淪於日。南海九島，。又有法人樹幟之消息。邊境情形。旣不堪言説。通商大埠。如天津。如上海。多駐有外兵。長江及沿海。外艦來往無阻。在如此情形之下。欲高談保安領土。其不可能。無待去年一二八上海之戰。今年北寗路用兵之苦。有識者固己早知之矣中國國防之第二困難問題。爲全國自當局者以至普通人民之國境觀念之糢糊薄弱。『國家面積愈大。則國人對於國境之注意愈小』固爲不易之定理。然國人國境觀念之糢糊薄弱。實未有如今日之中國者申報年鑑土地編所載中國國界諸地之名稱。有若干人能明知其地位現已出版之輿圖有多少之可恃。吾人殊不敢斷言。由國人對國境觀念之糢糊薄弱。遂不免有當局抛棄領土不稍吝惜之事。領土之不惜。何足言國防乎。今日欲眞正從事於軍事的國防。當自使國家權力能及於全部國境之一點做起。欲談國防敎育。當自使國民注意國家境界之一點做起。吾人持論如此。望國内地理學者有所努力也。</p>

<p>補救運華爪哇糖產　　挽救南洋羣島航業</p>
<p>爭運東北雜糧出口</p>
<p>爪哇糖運銷我國、年有數十萬噸、暢銷長江南北洋各地、惟在一二八戰事之後、輸入大减、及增加進口税後、爪糖來華、更一落萬丈矣、航輪遂亦大受影響、渣華輪船公司總大班嚴文海Ｊ·Ｎｉｅｕｗｅｎｈｕｙｓ氏、爲挽救南洋羣島航業、特親來上海、調查我國各地商業、以爲對華航業補救之準備、亟將爪糖之衰落等情、查記如下、</p>

<h3 id="c232">最近日本小學敎員之生活問題（袁文彰） <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>一·日本小學敎員之欠薪狀態</p>
<p>日本自農業恐慌發生以來、農村經濟殆入破產狀態、農民窮乏、影響到小學敎員的生活問題、甚至有如某農村爲發放欠薪起見、請該地敎員親赴農家追索未納税金等、此種狀態、可知日本地方政府對於經濟問題、實已毫無辦法、日本帝國敎員會於去年四月所調查的報告、内中欠薪者有一府二十四縣、（日本全國爲三府四十三縣）共三百八十一校、尤以熊東·長崎·長野等縣爲甚、今日則欠薪問題雖是波及全國、而如熊東等所謂更甚者、亦已並不罕見、現舉二三實例如左、</p>
<p>新瀉某敎員團體寄給同縣全體敎員的報告中有説、『觀察農村實情謀了解育界之動問時、覺得一切都是停滯腐敗、農業恐慌之深刻化、急激的招致本縣六千農村敎員之生活不安、自</p>
<p>下因延納租税之擴大、敎員之欠薪己逹三十餘校、農村方面並己實行强制捐助及减發賞金等等秋田縣下有百○三校欠薪、金額達十萬元以上敎員實在己到達窮苦之最下層了···一</p>
<p>和上述報告可以對照的、尙有縣學務課所調查去年年底的狀態之報告、依此報告、則欠薪者爲二十四鄉鎭、金額達二萬七千元、其中尤以佐渡之水津村爲更甚、卽自前年四月起直欠至去年年底、</p>
<p>長野縣的欠薪學校數去年四月是二十八校、五月是七十二校、至六月達百八十六校、現將同縣欠薪狀况統計如下、（一九三二年六月）</p>
<p>欠薪者</p>
<p>學校數四二五一八六</p>
<p>敎員數七、五一二人二、七一六人</p>
<p>同月薪額四一八千元一一九千元</p>
<p>二八·五四％</p>
<p>岩手縣北地方無一處能發全薪者、大槪所欠都在三個月左右、而東京朝日新聞岩手版並報説、『縣當局爲催費派員至各鄉鎭時、村長助理員及會計等都避而不見、於是當局亦祗有置諸不理、宫城縣之欠薪者達五十五鄉鎭、</p>
<p>在他方面、雖是發薪、因有强制捐助等種種榨取的方法、實質上還是等於減俸、翻閲帝國農會最近之『農村不况調查』、各地仍有許多實行强制捐助者、其數目則自一成至六分等、</p>
<p>二·日本小學敎員之待遇</p>
<p>日本小學敎員之薪金、本來也不見得有減俸的資格、所以結果、就大家無以爲生、日本全國小學敎員數卽初高等的正敎員、專科敎員准敎員、代用敎員等總數是二十三萬四千七百人（一九三一年三月調查）、各敎員所得平均數、尋常科正敎員男子七○元二角四分、女敎員四九元七角四分、如江都市和鄉村區别而男女混合對比之薪金比率、都市是五五％鄉村是四五％、</p>
<p>以上是平均額、現在再説最高最低者、卽最高之本科正敎員的男子是二百四○元、同女子是一二○元、初等科正敎員之男子是一三○元、同女子是一○○元、而最低之本科男敎員爲十元、女敎員爲十二元、初等科的男敎員爲十五元、女敎員爲八元、</p>

<h3 id="c233">放暑假 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 顏</p>
<p>烈日行天，緑蔭匝地，當炎熱之夏，各大中小學都放暑假了。</p>
<p>敎育當局規定小學暑假四十二天，中學五十六天，大學兩個月還要多些，同是一樣熱，而以學生大中小之不同，假期有長短之别。甲説：因爲大學生最怕熱，中學生次之，小學生又次之，所以大學假期最長，中學小學次之又次之。乙説：論理大學生身强力壯，較能耐熱，假期應放得最短；小學生還未發育成人；脆弱得很，最經不起熱，應最多放些日子。中學生仍介二者之間。丙説：學生愈大，愈大應讀死書，當到社會上去多讀活書，所以假期應最長。丁説：根本不應放暑假，如説天熱不能讀書，那末爲什麽不見農夫因而停止耕耘，工人因熱而不入工塲，商人因熱而關起店來，運人因熱而不打仗，黃包車夫因熱而不拖車。且一個假期並不是從第熱到末一天、一天之中，也不是從早熱到晚，不熱之天，風凉之上午，那可以讀書，放暑假後之暑期學校，如雨後春笋之勃發，不是熱天可以讀書之明證嗎？戊説：暑假應放，但當放假之前，學校中應規定一個假期作業給他們，學生處在農村裏的，呌他作什麽事、在工人區的，呌他們作什麽事，在都市的，呌他們作什麽事，一個個拿了作業大綱去，照大綱工作，到開學時各把作業報告交來，批評短長，這是一個絶好的成績，重要的學問。現在的學校，徒然放暑假，絶不給活書他們讀，耗費光陰，實在可惜！倒不如不放假給他們多讀些死書爲愈。</p>
<p>甲乙丙戊五人的説話，孰是孰非，請敎育界人士想想。</p>

<p>在黃布大傘底下。冰凍酸梅湯也趕上市來啦，五個銅子喝一杯，經濟的冷飲品；鄭福齋的好。丨一個朋友對着另一個朋友説。</p>

<p>傍晚，公園裏的長椅上坐滿了人，臀部碰着臀部；軍工路上的汽車，一輛銜接一輛地飛駛，汔車屁夾着塵灰捲起來，吹得人們喘不過氣。</p>
<p>海水在怒吼，街樹在搖曳，享受凉風的人們在歡笑！</p>
<p>又是夏天啦。丨活從人們的嘴裏滑出來，輕輕地。</p>
<p>焦太陽喝醉了威士忌，剛從都市回轉來，臉紅紅的，像隻杮子，踏着華爾茲的舞步，一歪一歪地，落在黛色的山背後去。</p>
<p>在荳棚瓜架下、莊稼人赤着膊，喝着白干兒，花生米，怡然自得。</p>
<p>田野送來了牧童的歌聲，布穀鳥的呌聲，金蟬的啼聲，靑蛙的閣閣聲。孩子們赤裸着身子，跳到小溪裏洗個淸水澡帶便摸一碗螺蚌，捉幾條大魚，回家去佐晚餐，眞樂啦。</p>

<h3 id="c235">扇子 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>扇子扇凉風，扇夏不扇冬。有人向我借，待到八月中。</p>
<p>這四句俚俗的詩，在小學生，商店夥計，以及略識幾個字的朋友，他們手中所拿的扇子上，常常看到。字句雖是俚俗，意義却很實際。照新文學家眼光看來，很可以收入民間文學的册子裏面。至於扇子不肯出借，這理由是很淺顯的。你熱我也熱；你要扇我也要扇。那個人肯犧牲自己幸福以利他人？你爲自己幸福而侵奪他人的權利，也不恕道。所以扇子不出借，於情於理，都是講得通的。而且『扇子跟人走』。你一邊揮着，一邊走着，也會忘記了物歸原主而扇到你的家裏來。</p>
<p>有智識的人，畢竟花樣多些。雪白的扇面，請了書家畫家，揮上幾筆。其實扇起來，未必風凉一些。而且爲了珍愛扇面上的書畫，反而不肯大扇特扇。這種扇子，與其説他是揮暑品，母寗説他是裝飾品，來得確切一些。</p>
<p>戲臺上的諸葛亮，不論寒冬暑熱，總持着一把羽毛扇。這把扇子，好像現在人所持的司的克，裝裝塲面，擺擺威風江湖朋友所用的油搭扇，中畫着閻王高坐；判官侍立；小鬼簇擁兩旁。我起始以爲勸善懲惡。後來纔知道畫裏包含着歌訣，就是江湖好漢進帮的條規。用扇雖沒有限制，可是暗中也有一定的區别。男子多用竹骨摺扇；女子用鵝毛扇和團扇；間有用小型的摺扇，這種扇子，長僅三四寸，那裏會扇出風來。江湖朋友和勞工們，喜用油搭扇；鄉下人喜用蒲扇。我以爲蒲扇風最大：價錢也最便宜；又最耐用。實利主義的朋友，大可提倡用蒲扇。</p>

<p>六月得岑西林訃，公之論定，自有國史傳贊，予第爲私人哀輓云爾。予從公游於清光緖甲午任大理卿時，其年與日本宣戰，公上奏請糾合先襄勤公舊部，出關殺敵，忠勇憤激，曰討日，曰征倭，聲光出今抗日上矣。得旨發交欽差大臣劉坤一差遣，公怏怏，而予亦辭去。越六年而有庚子拳亂，公勤王至西安，授陜撫，調晋撫，子二度入公幕，壬寅，移粤撫，未上，升川督，川有匪警，奉旨兼程前進，七月望發太原，八月廿四抵成都，朝野稱其神速，法國公使尤譽之。予爲隨節兼程之一人，時予年三十，公年可四十，從行文武數十，皆靑年，絶無五十歲人，一時人謂帥幕皆小孩云。行程循河東道，至陵風渡濟河，入潼關，過西安，逾渭水，取道鳳翔，由廣元昭化沿嘉陵江以入蜀，予此役得詩最富，公方接印，而電報公夫人卒於卾，公子德固殉焉。此一事，子不自知何心耿耿至今不能忘也。明年予以戴文誠師特科之薦入京。遂爲二度之辭去，别後一晤於舊京，再晤於上海，而淸禪政，人民國約八九年間，邂逅滬上一晤，談次較前尤多滄桑之感，邦之殄瘁，人之云亡，哀哉！自須門生故吏，爲追悼之會，數公之延攬，當以予爲最先，而亦最不長進，旣歎逝者，還復自念，百端交集，對此茫茫，屬以病廢，不克往哭，輒誎寫哀，其詞曰：</p>

<p>無如神經興奮起來了，却也是不聽人的指揮，窗子外面，風過天空聲，枯樹枝經着寒風摧折，卜突打擊屋瓦聲。士兵屋子裏的鼾呼聲，却是一陣一陣，送到了耳朶裏來。耳朶旣是未曾聾，人是醒的，這聲音决沒有不聽到之理。旣是聲聲都聽見，自然就睡不着了。也不知是什麽時候，他自己用了一些玄術，弄得自己和桂枝見面了。桂枝今天打扮的是更爲艷麗，穿了一件粉紅色長衣，在漆黑的髮　角下，倒挿了一朶紅花，這陪襯着他的面貎，别有一種洋洋的喜氣，莫非他是作新娘子了。要作新娘子，那當然是嫁我。他如此想着，似乎桂枝己把他的心事，洞若觀火的猜出來了。他瞪了眼道；你不要作那些夢想，以爲我能嫁你嗎？趙自强這倒炸了。嫁我不嫁我，那不要緊，爲什麽放出這種驕傲的樣子來。便道：這又不是我胡説的，自有人作媒爲證。你忽然變了心，莫不是要嫁甘二爺？你要知道他，現在窮得要死，連飯碗都找不着，還是我給他想的法子呢。桂枝道：你不要在身後糟榻人，我嫁他是嫁定了。你聽，他接我的花馬車來了。那不是奏着音樂隊嗎？趙自强聽説，仔細一聽，這可不就是吹着軍號嗎？然而這號聲並不是愛情曲子，乃是起床號，趙自强突然一個翻身坐了起來，呵喲！那裏有什麽人結婚，原來是自己作夢。這用不着什麽考慮了，自己趕快起床。當連長的人那總是比士兵自由且舒服得多。在趙自强剛起床之後，他的隨從兵已經進房來了，和他整理床舖，送洗臉水來。（一三九）</p>

<p>— 朱𦐂</p>
<p>在這太陽酷熱得像火傘下面，蓮，葉是亭亭田田地翻着滿塘綠雲，那白的紅的荷花，更像凌波仙子般掩映於綠葉中間；綽約的丰姿，淸幽的妙香，從微風中度上衣袂，眞好似坐對君子，俗氛全消。周敦頤先生説得好：『出汚泥而不染，濯淸泉而自潔，』其實蓮的德性，何止祗有潔身自好！那日的炎威愈酷，花也開得愈見精神，亭立在暴日之下，這種不屈撓的抗日精神，不但是花中英雄，並且也是我們的模範。揮汗作蓮花話，以實春秋小園藝。蓮的種類　蓮花最普通的，有紅蓮，白蓮兩種；紅裳素衣，映着那田田翠蓋，像洛水神女，凌波微步，雅澹清幽，眞不知是詩是畫！花瓣繁複，叢生如盤的，是重瓣蓮花；這種花大半是紅蓮，富麗是富麗了，可惜不結蓮蓬。一莖上開兩花的，呌『並蒂蓮；那位多才薄命的馮家小靑，伊焚餘草裏，曾吟詠過『···願將一滴楊枝水，化作人間並蒂蓮。』一莖三蒂的，呌品字蓮。此外還有一種重疊蓮花，外面的蓮花開足之後，裏面蓮蓬中再開出一朶蓮花，好似屋子的的樓房一般。此外還有碧蓮，睡蓮；碧蓮我沒有見過，睡蓮是外國種，花色有白，有淺紅，有淡黃，浮在水面，比較我國的蓮花，約小一倍。</p>
<p>蓮的培植　蓮是根生植物、他的根就是藕。培植方法，大都把藕秧留在泥裏，聽他自己生長。那植在缸裏的，當黃梅時節，先把河泥當做肥料，舖在藕秧上面，在日光裏晒着，等到河泥晒得起着龜圻，然後再把水澆下，仍放在日光中晒着、那綠葉紅花，就會迅速地生長着發榮開花，不過缸中的蓮花，澆水之後，第一不可缺水，須漸乾漸增，保住着平衡的水量。第二不可再加肥料，我的朋友柳君然畫師，他的畫室裏，植着三缸重疊蓮花，今年加水後，因嫌葉子不大，再加了些河泥，可惜兩缸已經菡蓓的蓮花，都葉焦花枯，竟至萎悴而死。蓮的食品　蓮花花瓣，可製花露。蓮子和藕，除了生食；蓮子煮熟了，可以做糖蓮子，蓮子　。藕可煮菜肴，還可煮熓熟藕，和藕粉。（以老藕摀爛濾汁，俟粉質凝沉後，以沸水調食，清香腴美，較市上出售的藕粉，滋味遠勝。）藕節和藕，還可入藥。那鮮荷葉的粉蒸雞，肉，更是夏日當令的佳肴。</p>
<p>蘇州的蓮　蘇州葑門城外的黃天藕，荷塘十里，紅荷映日，綠葉停雲，早成了蘇州夏季唯一的勝地。那肥脆鮮嫩，馳譽江南的塘藕，就產生在那裏。園林裏的荷花，以前景德路遂園，時有品字蓮和並蒂蓮發見，可惜現在己久不開放了。此外拙政園因荷池的面積還寛大，蓮花還可一觀外，留園和滄浪亭等等，大都祗有普通的紅蓮，並且也並不繁茂。近年公園中的蓮花，因添開了一個池塘，確比較以前繁盛衆多，在淸晨或夜晚，到東齊茶社飲一甌清茗，那雅澹的淸香，微微送來，眞覺飄飄欲仙。可惜公園游者，俗客太多，正競競於兩性追逐，能領略蓮花清趣者，千百中能有幾人？唉！</p>

<p>— 另境</p>
<p>平心而論，編一本書的價値也并不低於著一本書的。尤其是在文化水準極低的中國目前。新文化運動十多年來，一般靑年尙迷戀於古文詩詞武俠性愛小説的圈子裏，不但各種科學理論沒有研究出多少成績，卽對於新文學也何嘗有甚麽深刻的理解，春　般的性愛小説之風行，就是明證。（若以爲庸俗的三角四角戀愛小説只有店員之類的人去讀它，實乃大誤。）所以現在負着文化運動任務的人，與其專去販運外國名著，何如謄出一部份精力來做一點改頭換面的編述工作，以供範圍較廣的一般人閲讀，其意義實較前者更爲遠大。此其一。其次，目下能眞正應用科學方法從事研究的，究屬甚少，况因年月之短促，欲產生成熟的著作亦不可能，卽現有爲人所注意的幾種學術專著，亦不外借助於外人研究的成績，而所謂唯物辯證法之應用，尤其乖謬百出。故若索性『舍本逐末』節职國外名著，詳爲編述，於編者固能獲得有益之借鑑，於讀者反較讀生呑活剝之本廠貨得益多多。此我之所以説編不低於著的又一理由。</p>
<p>雖然，考之現在出版界的編述品，却又不能使人滿意。這原因大槪是一般編述家受着生活的逼迫，沒有充分時間去詳搜博採，只望多凑幾張稿紙，計算多換一點生活費，結果便成了雜凑品，其無價値可知。此卽現在的編述品不能爲人看重的原因。</p>
<p>當我在北方執敎的時候，就感着一穩困難，一般靑年是有着新求知欲希望讀一些理論書的，但他們對於現在的許多硬譯品又讀不懂，近來聽説這些書完全沒有銷路了，則更可證明此路實有商量之餘地。我以爲最好能有一種名著述略本出現，把那許多深奥的理論通俗化起來，這實是編述家的任務。</p>

<p>林庚白『孑樓詩詞話』（七月十九晨報）</p>
<p>，載魯迅一九三一年所作，曾刋載於文藝新聞』上的舊詩一首，詩曰：</p>
<p>慣於長夜過春時，</p>
<p>絜婦將雛鬢有絲。</p>
<p>夢裏依稀慈母淚，</p>
<p>城頭變幻大王旗。</p>
<p>忍看朋輩成新鬼，</p>
<p>怒向刀叢覓小詩。</p>
<p>吟罷低頭無寫處，</p>
<p>月光如水照緇衣。</p>
<p>詩後有『詩詞話』作者的按語説，『夢裏依稀慈母淚之句，以詩論固佳，然吾儕士大夫階級之意識與情緒，蓋不自學其流露，布爾雪維克無是也。』魯迅是不是如林庚白所説的這樣的人，我不知道，但説這樣的人一定不會懷念慈母，我却不能同意。一樣的有血，有肉，有豐富的情感，對於慈愛的母親，爲什麽不會懷念呢？不必遠徵博引，就把最近『文學』上所載的關於小林多喜二的事抄下一則吧：</p>
<p>母親己是有年紀的人，他心裏老是掛念着母親，在忙碌中，一有機會，便竭力想使母親快樂。阿哥（指小林多喜二）看到母親快樂也就樂起來了。</p>
<p>母親在革命者的眼中，是一樣的可愛啊！這看丁玲的『母親』（良友書局文藝叢書，和另一個短篇，）是也可以得到旁證的。我覺得，林庚白，在這一點上，如果不是誤信了傳言，把革命者『惡』化了，便是單純的從『鐵的意志』一面，機械的理解了革命者。</p>

<p>我有五個四川朋友，一天聚集着閒談，偶然提到原籍問題，知道他們都不是眞正的四川人：成都人的趙君原籍是浙江，華陽人的文君是湖南，自流井人的李君是廣東，内江人的余君是湖北，峩眉人的金君是江蘇。他們的祖先搬到四川去住下，都不過是兩百來年以前的事情。他們還都保持着固有的地方色彩，一説穿就覺得是很確實的，考查起來，現在住在四川的眞正的四川人並不多，大半都是由各省趕攏去的，這是因爲在明朝末了的時候，張獻忠在四川大大的殺人，形成了『張獻忠殺盡四川人』的話。事實上四川人雖不曾殺盡，可是實在殺了不少。四川本是地大物博的，所以各省的人都趕攏去了。</p>
<p>隨便殺人，本是有了刀槍的人的常事。不過一般人的殺人，目的大槪是爲排除異己。張獻忠殺人的動機，却並非專爲這個，他的七殺碑上明明這樣寫着，『天生萬物與人，人無一物』</p>
<p>與天，殺，殺，殺，殺，殺，殺，殺！從這些話看來，他要這樣殺人，好像是替天報復的。照蜀碧和蜀龜鑑所紀載，他常常把小孩子擲在空中，任憑落下觸在槍尖上，看着那流着鮮血狂呌亂動的情况以爲快樂。可見他的殺人，替天報復以外，還寓着游嬉的意義。</p>
<p>據説張獻忠以殺人爲游嬉的方法多得很，有一回，他己積起了一大堆的婦女的小脚，帶着他的愛妾去觀賞。看了一陣，覺得那山一般的小脚堆上還缺少兩隻出色的小脚做頂尖，就把他愛妾的脚割下來放上去了。</p>
<p>每到一處，他照例殺一大批人以後，總要把頭，手和脚分别堆積起來，點清數目以後，記一筆賬，還要刻在碑上。</p>
<p>一天晚上，張獻忠把他自己的老婆和兒子都殺了。第二天　是　悔，　他的從人不去勸阻，於是把從人也都殺了。他的妻子固然服從他，他的從人連殺他自己的妻子都不敢去勸阻更是絶對服從的；但他統統殺了，可見他的殺人，並非專爲排除異己。</p>
<p>張獻忠的殺人，有時無非出於好奇心，譬如殺一個狀元的事。他很尊重那狀元，只是因爲欽佩己極，要明白他爲什麽能夠多才多藝，就把那狀元活活的剖開肚子來看了。</p>
<p>張獻忠眞可謂勇於殺人的了，殺人的花樣也是夠多的了。但他都是明做的，不曾用過暗殺的手段，這一點還値得我們佩服的。</p>
<h3 id="c243">月的夢 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 孫泱</p>
<p>月光像水一般從窗隙瀉到黑暗的房裏，頑皮地吻着我的書桌，桌上反映出黯淡的灰色的微光，房裏的靜物便呈現出模糊的陰影。</p>
<p>我斜靠着桌子，靜靜地注視着那一線月光，温柔，淡雅，幽靜，神秘</p>
<p>『月的夢呵！』我輕輕地拍着胸膛嘆息。</p>
<p>回憶己離我遠了，可是僅餘的遺跡己足夠震動我的心弦，我喜歡回憶着她丨丨我那不愛我的愛人。我半開着　，默默地沉息着嬉　　的話。　酸梅湯的　　　　　　　　　　　　　月光漏過柳葉的叢，撒到我和她的身上，六月的晚風拂着她的　髮。</p>
<p>『月亮是團圓的呢，』她抬起頭，用明亮的大眼從葉隙中望着天。</p>
<p>『我們也是團圓的呵！』我揑着她的温軟的小手。</p>
<p>『夢裏的幸福，我們睜着眼享受。』她的嘴角上掛着獅芬克司的微笑，倒在我的懷裡。</p>
<p>『這是月的夢呵！』我吻着她的紅菱角似的嘴唇。</p>
<p>我望着月光　傲地笑了。我輕輕撫着自己的唇，它曾經吻過那迷人的嘴唇呀！月光慢慢地移動，漸漸地丢掉我的書桌，吻着地板了。突然，我的胸膛裡充滿了憤怒，這樣利害的憤怒，它彷彿不受胸膛的拘束而要爆發出來，我吻過的嘴唇，現在恐怕正吻着另一張嘴兒哪！</p>
<p>我忘掉了自己的肉體，呆呆地注視着那一線月光。</p>
<p>『月的夢呵！』我吐一口氣，低聲嘆息着。</p>
<h3 id="c244">平凡的事（二三） <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 澹果孫</p>
<p>『眞殼二十多里！』之光照着説了一遍，『那一帶危險嗎？』『危險倒還沒有，』那工人説，『矮鬼還沒有打到那裏，這兩天，我們晚上運過去安的東西眞多，大槪不久也要打了。</p>
<p>『一打，』另一個工人説，『運東西到那裏去就危險了；現在危險的地方還是閘北，頂危險的要算寳山路到八字橋一帶！</p>
<p>『三不知就是兵林朋隆一大陣，』另外又一個工人指着東邊説，『聽罷，這一陣又鬧了點把鐘了！』</p>
<p>説到這裏，大家都停了一下；末了，之光問；</p>
<p>『你們做的東西，難道全是用人工抬了去的嗎？』</p>
<p>『差不多全是抬了去的，』某一個工人説，『我們的車子太少，要運的東西太多，所以總先儘最要緊的或者最沈重的用卡車運，剩下的就全用人抬，那末自然就慢了！</p>
<p>『慢了是很不好的！』另一個工人説，『説到做，我們究竟還來得及，然而因爲要抬，這裏』</p>
<p>頭至少就要把三股之一的工友，輪做夜班去管『抬』的事情，　因此就把『安』的事情躭誤了！若是再添夜班的人去『安』，那末『做』的人一少，東西就出得慢了！</p>
<p>『這自然要想法子補救才好！』之光誠懇地説。</p>
<p>這時候，之光己經墜人沈思的境界裏了，他那副深睫毛的近視眼，始終一開一關不住地贬到吃完了那頓午飯才停止。</p>
<p>於是之光用一種類乎會議又類乎調查的形式和這些在陳家浜做工的木工談了大半天；末了，他立起來向大衆説；</p>
<p>『我對於各位的服務熱枕，是十二分欽佩的！我對於長興廠的工友們將要向廠裏提出來的要求，也是十二分同情的！不過我在廠裏，儘管有一種能彀多説兩句話的力量，然而却只能彀説，還不能彀説了就可以呌人家照着去做，這也是各位都明白的。所以我現在只能彀以代表者的地位，極力去勸廠裏的東家！極力去勸廠裏的東家！總要他能彀實行接洽！大衆都鼓掌了，之光接着又説：</p>
<p>『根據剛才的前前後後的談話，我也明白軍事當局的佈防情形，看來是要在很近的期間之内，把閘北到吳淞之間的三十多里，築成一條極堅固的戰壕。那末當然是很緊急的了，因而我明白運輸器具的接濟，遠比其他的接濟重要得多，這一層，我很淸楚，我要設法呌廠裏的東家和我一樣淸楚！大家的事，大家要負擔，我的心，和各位的心是站在一條線上的！</p>
<p>這幾句短簡而誠懇的演説，當然是很受歡迎的，很呌這些工人抱着滿意的希望的。以後的下文，在他們看來就是去找姚伯唐而己，但是之光却還想到劉家宅那裏去，所以他就向他們説：</p>
<p>『現在東面還在那裏兵林朋隆，我們這時候要到劉家宅，應當怎樣走！』</p>
<p>『這是很難説的，』某一個工人説，『前兩天，打得厲害的時候，劉家宅的人都移動了，那一帶離八字橋太近！今天的情形，看來未見得比那一天髮、説是要到那一帶去，就很難説了！』</p>
<p>這問題，一時眞討論不出甚麽結果，因爲之光决計要到劉家宅去探問長興廠裏的那些泥土，而這裏的木工又勸他不可以過於冒險，這時候，閘北的槍砲聲音固然沒有停，而空中那幾架飛機也循環地在戰區上面飛翔不息；直到那個管理陳家浜一帶工兵的組長，在兩點鐘光景來視察的時候，才把這個小困難打開。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c265">談『世風』和『人情』之日下 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 惠成</p>
<p>當翻開報紙來看的時候，眼睛前所接觸的差不多都是些偷盜，姦淫，自殺等等的新聞。於是大家都嘆息着世風人情之日下了。的確，這是實在的話，社會上充滿了罪惡。但是我們却不應該像那一班道學夫子們一樣的含糊，不關痛養的只是嘆息，因爲這於事有何補呢！我們却應該很冷靜地用客觀的眼光來分柝這所以『世風』和『人情』之日下的原因，而末了應該怎樣的去補救。</p>
<p>自然，人是應該先飽了肚子，但是人生的條件並不這樣的簡單。除了飯爲人生的主體外，還有許多的慾望丨丨需要丨存在着。譬如説：在某一個生理變態中我們需要性交、而某一個時期中也需要穿衣暖體。不過在現在的畸形社會上，是否能很普遍的解决這些問題呢？除了一班的資產階級外能享受或超過這些的條件，餘下的比資產階級還要多的人簡直連吃飯的先决條件還生問題哩但是人類終究要有需要的。於是他們搶了，偷了，姦了。不過其中的有一部份感覺到這些的行動都不敢或不願去幹，便走上自殺之道了。這樣的一來，道家便嘆息着世風和人情之日下。</p>
<p>假使我們用邏輯Ｌｏｇｉｃ的態度來分析他們的行動是否犯罪、那麽我們一定承認在道德上·Ｖｉｒｔｕｒｅ他們是錯誤犯罪的，但是在思想的出發點上説來，他們不但不犯罪而且是對的。因爲他們是人啊！是應該需要有吃飯，穿衣和性交的動物啊！</p>
<p>不過，他們的行動上是値得有糾正的必要：自殺的應該奮勇起來；搶，偷，姦淫的應該冷靜起來。大家應該站在一條戰綫上去解决他們的吃飯，穿衣和　性交。因爲單獨的幹是容易碰壁的。</p>
<h3 id="c266">我果爲環境所支配嗎 <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— 悟非</p>
<p>李君。是ＸＸ大學畢業。富有理智的人。當他初離學校生活而任事於金業交所。與社會世故開始接觸的時候，對於業務。非常盡職。對於同事。十分和洽。尤其是金錢的出納。往來的酬應。更能出以審愼。原來他在校裏的當兒。聽得某友因沈迷賭博而解雇，某戚因留戀女色而撤職。某人因經濟關係而結果自殺。以及某人因某事而發生不幸等等　。他時常想難道社會的誘惑性。果如此利害嗎。環境的支配力。果如此偉大嗎。所以他就業之始。抱定宗旨。要打破環境。不爲環境所支配。常常有一個我果爲環境所支配嗎一個問題。盤旋往復在腦海裏。</p>
<p>他的思想太靈敏了。他以爲在『嫖賭吃著』四字的環境裏。最容易受牠誘惑和支配。所以他有一個『四不』主義。就是不入花叢。不爲局戲。不吸烟酒。不穿華服。他能努力地做去。不與俗同。大家多欽敬他。錫他一『少年老成』的　離婚後的丈夫！生活津貼費義璋</p>
<p>徽號。但他在金業交易所内。無非是金臭冲天。利慾熏心的環境。他看見同人中兼營是業。往往發了大財。不是賺三千。就是餘一萬。他的心田。未免歆羡。他的雙晴。未免眼紅。以爲發財這麽容易。也就在不知不覺地活動起來。那末合組經營。也想發一票財。詎知初出茅廬。破題兒第一遭。適在此世界金潮的時候。價格日跌。損失了一千多兩。雖是懊喪。依舊交易。不上一週。又損失了二千多兩。數目旣大。應付就覺困難。親朋中知道其事的。多勸他不要在這嚴重的時期中。盲目的虚擲。只好再待機緣。不可徒作犧牲的。他聽了以後。忽然大澈大悟起來。道吾果爲環境所支配嗎。他立刻將欵結束。忍痛一時。仍舊實行他的四不主義。一天。有人去問他。你爲甚回頭這樣快呢。他就發表一番議論道。『打破環境。這件事很不容易。吾不必把歐美的學理來説。總之德性的堕落。人格的卑下。無非是受環境支配的結果。譬如很勤樸誠實的鄉農村姑。到了都市裏後。潛移默化。久而久之。也會狡猾起來。也會摩登起來。能夠不爲環境所支配者有幾。反過來説。就是都市的士女們。衣食住行的四件生活大事。確是滿意和舒適。一旦呌他們到鄉村去。就覺得起居不惯語言</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>無味。十分地孤寂。煩悶。能夠自創新環境者又有幾人呢。所以在某一種環境裏。能夠遇到了富貴。貧賤。威武三種境地。所不能淫。所不能移。所不能屈。實不易見。又在另一種環境裏。如苦其心志。勞其筋骨。飢其體膚。空乏其身。行拂亂其所爲。所以動心忍性。增益其所不能者。亦不多得。即如我起初抱定宗旨。要不爲環境所支配。但是感受了無形的誘惑。也會被他支配。幾乎誤入歧途。幸而勒馬懸崖。戞然而止。結果尙能保持。所以我們不但要不爲環境所支配。不但要打破環境。又須能自己創造新環境。才有生路呢。大家多佩服他的高論，多佩服他有主見。</p>

<p>— 烈火</p>
<p>也許是同病相憐，也許是問題太嚴重了。每早打開報紙，除了儘先翻看有不有自己的文章登出。隨着便兩眼瞪視着『自我職業介紹』諸君，精細的唸讀他們各個的略歷，精細的推敲這問題的因果·結果便像有一方厚重的岩石，緊榨在我的心頭，窒息而不能動彈。</p>
<p>本刋增設該欄，爲時己有半載，每日登出的人數，多至二十一人，十九人，少亦有五六人，平均每日十人，總計己有一千八百人。近來各報亦多有該欄之設，再加上渺無可紀的未投登的人，合計增添十倍，便爲一萬八千人，這統計雖不正確，但我想只有多不會少，上海有多少人呢？失業者已有這麽一個巨大的數目，這問題不能不算嚴重了。</p>
<p>論其出身，大多是中學畢業，高小出身的很少，大學畢業得有學士頭銜者居次，甚至在國外吃過十數年洋麵包的也有。</p>
<p>論其才學，有精通國文者、有能操滬粤及各地方言者、有英文能説能作能繙譯者、有會計深有根底者，有能打樣繪圖充當工程師者。</p>
<p>論其履歷，有曾充黨政機關要職者，有曾充洋行公司職員者，有當過私人秘書的，也有當過中小學校長或敎員的，有自己曾經營過企業的，也有在别人公司裏當過經理的。</p>
<p>出身不能謂微，才學不能謂淺，履歷更不能謂低，雖不全是頂乖乖的人才，但至少每個都有一藝之長，在需才孔殷的現在中國社會裏，本不應使他們袖手無事，然而事實陳擺在我們的眼前，他們是被摒棄了的失業者。</p>
<p>爲什麽有這麽多人失業呢？第一是緣於經濟不景氣，因此各業都呈阢隉不安的恐怖現象，因此各業都取緊縮政策、要興辦的事擱淺不提了，己興辦的也都縮小範圍，裁員减薪，時有所聞，於是乎社會上失業的人多了、</p>
<p>因爲第一個原因，當然的，便形成『人浮於事』的現象，安置人才的機關有限，需要安置的人却擁擠不堪，於是有限的機關便被下列的幾種人，捷足先得，牢牢的覇住了。</p>
<p>（一）善於拍馬吹牛者</p>
<p>（二）有裙帶關係者</p>
<p>（三）有某種背景或系統者</p>
<p>（四）有特殊才學者</p>
<p>這就使失業者長久失業，後起者離開學校，便無事可做，於是失業者越益增多了。在這種情形之下，且看失業者進一步的悲痛序幕。</p>
<p>雖然自信才學叮噹，眼見兜售之不可能，乃把慾望儘力低壓，减價出售，從『薪金不計』『半盡義務』一只求供給膳宿等價目看來，可知失業者渴求職業的强度了，只要能馬虎解决一己生活，即告滿足。而就業的眼光更低，曾經當過秘書的願當書記，當過高級職員的願當跑街，更有中學畢業的願當隨從走使，總之只要有人承受。但不幸，那裏有回嚮，有幾個成了功？</p>
<p>都市裏旣這樣無路可走，爲什麽不歸回廣大的農村去？可憐農村更死氣，更貧窮，兵亂，匪患，税捐，天災，緊急的在破壞，歸得去麽？歸去又能生活麽？</p>
<p>這兩日編輯先生頂出了『本欄積稿甚多、暫時停收）的啓事、更使我猛然感到署假己届，各校率己舉行畢業典禮，也計有關於『現積稿甚多』吧，畢業即失業，這是毋庸掩節的現敎育的歸宿論。</p>
<p>這樣，在現階段上，失業問題只有一篐一篐的緊迫起來。不過『物極必反』</p>
<p>，也許不久有總解决的一天吧。</p>

<h3 id="c269">痛苦的訴述 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我現在有個難題請先代爲解答那是非常感激的：</p>
<p>茲將我的日常生活表錄下：</p>
<p>在七點鐘起身，作那掃抺之事，至七點半　　店中的　小菜。　就，我們的經理先生起身，卽取面水，與買點心。（我店是連家店，經理的父母及兄嫂　　　　住　店的　上。</p>
<p>十句鐘，吃粥。那時粥菜己吃完，惟有白粥，吃與不吃，由你可也。此項工作己完，才做店事。做的乃不過拿拿物品，寄寄信，無一件是正當事體。吃飯後要洗碗筷。至下午，又是要點心，司各人吃的不同，故東一家，西一家，至少又非要二句鐘不可。夜飯吃罷，現在熱天，是泡水，代人拿浴盆等。至十時以後，又是點心時間到了。至十二時方正。我們店中，申報是有的，但是經理先生的命令，不准看報及看書。因爲看書報時眼在書裏，外面有賊，卽不知也。又在十二句鐘以後，不准開燈。（因經理先生在十時睡覺，經理的家眷要十二時始睡。）睡後，我想練習練習，但是這種命令，誰肯違反他呢？</p>
<p>先生，我是一個十六歲的人。資本家用這種手段，使我成一個無能之人，將來什樣可以自立呢？這種生活，眞正是非人生活！但是不高興做，回到家中去，那麽事實上辦不到。假使再住下去，年齡飛的過去，有何立身之術，以救我之將來乎？現在我的苦衷己告訴完了，請先生答復下列問題：</p>
<p>用何方法便資本家改良待遇？</p>
<p>我想讀書，以求自立，請先生指導何處有義務的學校？如無者，請敎以什樣自修？用何方法脱離此種環境，以求光明大道？前茫上答：來信描寫學徒生活的痛苦，眞可以代表中國一般商店學徒的生活狀况。中國有整千整萬的學徒，他們就都在這種重重壓迫之下呻吟着，過活着。然而他們至多只能呻吟而己，他們决不會爬起來反抗！粗手赤脚的工人們，他們至被壓迫到實在不堪時、他們就會集合起來，號呌起來。罷工，反抗，羣衆的熱情，和　火山一般爆發開來！以他們羣衆的熱血，羣衆的意志，去找尋他們光明之路。學徒們就始終不會如此！他們只會呻吟着，呻吟着，被壓迫到死！這就是我們學徒階級的根本弱點！因爲不知團結，不知反抗，所以被壓迫了不知多少年，到現在他們的生活還是沒有一點改進。這去怪誰，都是自己不長進。來信所述痛苦，我誠然同情、然而我决不有一點可憐之心。我所要問你的，是：爲什麽不反抗？你怕飢餓，嘲笑，辱駡，和一切的壓迫嗎？假使你有上戰塲銜鋒的勇氣，這些又怕他做什麽？</p>
<p>來問一點，奉答於下：</p>
<p>（一）用何法使資本家改良待遇？恕我學識淺陋，從來沒有聽見資本家會肯改良工人的待遇！資本家命裏呌他要剝削工人、才能致富，否則他就不成其爲資本家。要改良我們自己的待遇，方法儘有，那就是靠自己的力量！你若説使資本家來改良，那除非等資本家死絶，這希望是一輩子不會達到的。</p>
<p>（二）上海雖爲一大都會，然而義務學校還不大聽見有。或者退一步就比較價廉的夜校去讀也可。（本報現設有業餘補習學校多所，公共）</p>
<p>租界法租界東市閘北各處皆有，内分英算國文會計日文俄文等科，初級一律每學期收費六元，高級十元，價並不昻，君如有志讀書，可隨時前來報名。但來信旣説讀報也犯店章的、那恐這種讀書方法，也未必能實現吧。）自修可就自己所需要者學習之。如你要做買賣，普通商業信札算法及商業常識等，你就不能不留意。此外，最重要的，平時在實際生活中所得到的生活經騐，也是頂好沒有的學問。如你因浸有錢讀書而致被迫爲學徒、又因爲學徒而備受種壓迫，這是你的生活經騐。你就得在這方面推究去：爲什麽我不能讀書？爲什麽我要受商店經理無理之壓迫？然後想到我怎樣推翻這壓迫？你若能從這方面尋出一條路來。那你前途實有可望，比之徒然讀得幾本死書，還要受用得多！最後你問用怎樣方法脱離此種環境？我看就你能力環境言，最好回去同父母商量，明白要求另謀職業，如父母不允，你應該堅持到底，我想這目的一定可以達到。</p>
<p>總之：你現在一方面應以百折不撓的精神去求和；一方面則需要以一往直前的勇氣往前幹！先死飢寒利慾，一切應置諸度外，這樣，然後你才能得生！</p>

<p>（二十）今晚陪她的不見得祇我一人呀！</p>
<p>今天石喬己和王化向陳天任領到了兩百塊錢、他們兩人各分贓了六十塊、</p>
<p>其餘八十元分給了他們的帮手。</p>
<p>石喬走回家，除還了向美子借的那五塊錢外，並付了一個月的房租二十八元，餘下二十餘元作爲吃飯用的。</p>
<p>晚間到溫泉浴室洗了澡，回了家裏沒有一點事好做，想打美子談話，到底立給諾夫在家有點不方便，於是他想到三姨太，可不知三姨太在家不。便走去敲她的門，房裏原祇有阿珍一個人坐在那兒瞎想什麽心思。他問道：</p>
<p>『丹麗丨太太那裏去了！』</p>
<p>『瑪琍飯店去了，今晚不會回來的，』阿珍歪着頭説，當石喬表示一種驚愕的樣子，她便做着媚眼道：『李先生不曉得嗎，我還以爲是陪李先生去開房間的呢！李先生，你和我們太太眞要好得來哇！</p>
<p>『她是一個人去的嗎。』</p>
<p>『啊唷唷，你也吃她的醋嗎！她也吃李先生的醋呢，李先生不是和這二房東女人東洋婆子很要好麽？</p>
<p>『瞎三話四！』李石喬口裏雖這樣抵辯着，心裏確然有些酸溜溜地。他明知自己並不眞心地戀愛着三姨太，但三姨太確然是愛着他的，愛過自己的人又去愛别人，無論如何他認爲是一種侮辱。阿珍看出了這個隱秘，乘機施出她的勾引手段，譬如和李石喬説話的時候，身子並不轉過來，讓臀部突出向着他，一邊臉扭轉在肩上，眼睛溜在眼角邊反過來看人、這種迷人的姿態，多少是模仿了三姨太，不過由阿珍丨一隻剛成熟的果子做出來，却另有一番騷動，她故意顫動着聲音说：</p>
<p>『李先生，你在走桃花運啦！』</p>
<p>丨丨這東西是和三姨太半斤；兩的貨色啦　！石喬幾乎動搖了。但是由阿珍這種和三姨太相仿的姿態，又聯想到三姨太也許正對别人做着這種姿態呢。於是便斷然地回到房裏穿好衣服，向瑪琍飯店出發。</p>
<p>走到瑪琍飯店，却不曉得是開的幾號房間。看見有幾個熟習的茶房，又不便怎樣問起、便祇好埀頭喪氣的走了出來。馬路上，人車的來往仍不减於戰前時的熱鬧。紅的，緣的廣告燈。招牌燈，一樣地佈滿了街衢，燈下的妓女，成排的站着，並不因戰事曾經冷淡，生意反而較戰前更爲興隆。原因是民衆並未因戰爭而興奮起來，却是因戰爭的剌激，覺得憤情無可發洩，反過來，這證明民衆是在要求怒吼而不可得祇好無目的地消耗自己的精力呀！李石喬也許就是　　的　　　　當然他　不能看出這現象　底裏　而且他正　心一意在盤算怎</p>

<p>— 瑞</p>
<p>電影在現代，已成了一般人需要的食糧，差不多和每天吃飯，看報紙爲同一的重要了。不過引以爲憾事的，便是這『食糧』，僅僅是限於資產者與小資產者，而且，這『食糧』的本身，也僅能給予觀衆以消『閒』而不能給他們以營養。</p>
<p>中國因爲傳統的錮習，民智閉塞，文化落後，以致大多數的民衆對於智識的營養是缺乏得不堪的。他們幾乎像一個飢餓得枯槁的災民一樣。這般人在都市裏當然還不多，但是在鄉村裏却幾乎占了全部，這般人是如何的需渴着智識的營養啊！</p>
<p>電影是建設的先鋒，敎育的工具，因此，在這時候，應該義不容辭的喚起極大的使命來，我們所喊的口號是『以銀幕代替書本丨』</p>
<p>這句話，在歐洲各國丨丨尤其是蘇聯，己經是實現了，凡是看過『生路』的人，大槪總己領敎了吧？那種敎育方法，眞正比了書本的力量偉大到不知多少倍，然而中國的電影却一向忽視了這一點。最近，中國纔有敎育電影這名詞漸漸爲人注意起來，他們己覺得建設新中國，只有從敎育電影入手。</p>
<p>怎樣把銀幕來代替書本呢？敎育影片裏應該放些什麽呢？意大利電影專家薩爾地Ｓａｒｄｉ的意見是：『例如表現各國大事，包括表現地方事件之足可借鏡者』</p>
<p>，風俗片及風景片之表演各國之天然風景及該國民間風俗者：職業訓練片之表演工藝學校之敎科者；影片之表演各國國内及國外實業者，如築鐵路，造船，造汽車，築路，架橋樑等。其次爲衛生及疾病預防影片之表演如何預防並診治傳染病科學片表現之範圍最廣，自昆蟲生活以至於結晶鑛物，自植物胚芽以至於銧之應用法等至於農學影片，則尤爲重要，藉可宣傳最優良之耕種方法，俾收穫豐饒，並表現耕種機器之不斷進步情形。至於軍事影片，對於訓練新兵，乃極大之助力於是我們知道敎育影片中包含的眞是多啊！</p>
<p>中國是迫切需要這一種重大的工作，同時我預料這種電影出世，一定也能夠引起廣大民衆新奇的注意與熱烈的歡迎的。</p>
<p>無論關乎電影事業的前途，或民衆敎育，『銀幕代替書本』應該給我們深切的注意。中國電影界的同志們啊！應該怎麽努力來做這一步鑿山開道的工作啊！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c272">評『千古恨』 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 靡蕪</p>
<p>小影片公司，因爲經濟關係，設備方面，常常不能和大公司比較。但是一張影片的内容，是不會因爲公司之大小，而影響到他的優劣所以許多人對於小公司的出品，往往比較寛容，這自然有相當的理由的。不過我個人對於影片的内容，是主張不放鬆的。這是我批評（假使説得上的話小公司影片的態度，或者不能當作閑話看罷</p>
<p>『千古恨』一張十足的果報主義的影片，它相信善惡和苦樂的因果關係，同時他也相信法律是絶對的正確。所以他不但説明犯人的行爲，終於暴露被逮，就是寫犯人駕了飛機逃遁，還是給豫先準備好的所謂『飛彈』射擊，毁滅，這不是非常明顯的嗎？</p>
<p>和别的影片一樣，中間的愛情的穿挿，是必然有的。而這個穿挿，不過要使法律的擁護者，得到極圓滿的結果，此外，沒有其他作用。</p>
<p>我們常常看到舊的武俠小説，著作者不但剏造出一個顯官來執行法律，同時更剏造幾個『英雄』來帮助執行法律。『千古恨』就完全含有這類小説的意味。</p>
<p>説到技術，導演是極平庸的。他同樣的運用了。二次回憶鏡頭，而使觀衆感到討壓，挿入的鏡頭太長，使觀衆有故事的開展隔絶掉的感覺。字幕上説志岐自已發明的飛機，要是完全完成的話，比普通飛機，要快上三分之一，但中問并沒飛機完成的塲面，就騰空而去。并且旣然比普通飛機還快三分之一，那未，當然非汽車所能及，而在銀幕上我們看到的飛機，業已騰空，警士打電話到公安局，然後再由探長回到家裏去拿『飛機』經過這樣的長時間，飛機應該早己不知去向了，何以飛彈射上去，飛機就即刻落下呢？還有志岐旣是積年大盜，何以麗蓮潛入他的密室的時候，他一無所覺呢？而在畫面上看到的，也是志岐有意反臉迥避，讓她進去。</p>
<p>此外則因爲内景少，所以光線，大槪都不甚好，就是内景，燈光也太不調和　。</p>
<p>演演方面，可以説沒有一個會表現的。比較好些的還是魏光壽。</p>

<p>Eastern Counties to be Received Tomorrow</p>
<p>County Magistrates Conferred with Li Jichun Yesterday on All Matters</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Along the Beining Line Between Tangshan and Yu Not Yet Fully Withdrawn</p>
<p>(Tangshan) Song Naigan arrived at the Tangshan Public Security Bureau at 10:00 AM on the 25th to formally take over. The puppet regime's director, Gao Xixian, was present to hand over the seal. Initially, the puppet side was unwilling to hold a ceremony, but after Song explained the solemn nature of the handover, they proceeded with the reception ceremony, which was quite grand. Li Jichun, in his capacity as Chairman of the Reorganization and Dismissal Committee, dispatched Zhang Shouxian to attend the ceremony. Song personally raised the national flag. The handover was completed at 11:00 AM. The five branch bureaus under its jurisdiction were also taken over simultaneously. The Kailuan mining area security team was also restored to its old system. Song continues to serve concurrently as the captain-general, with a total police force of nearly 1,000 people, including 600 in the security team and over 300 in the public security team, ensuring peace and order. There were no major changes among the bureau's officials. In the afternoon, both sides conducted a handover inventory. Upon seeing the blue sky and white sun flag again, all businesses enthusiastically hung flags to commemorate the occasion. The atmosphere in the streets was completely renewed. Song stated that the handover was smooth due to the perfect negotiations by the various committee members beforehand and Li's deep understanding of righteousness. The takeover of the eastern counties will also not be a problem. Regarding the reorganization and dismissal of Li's troops, Li has dispatched personnel to the counties, commencing on the 26th to proceed locally, with the surplus troops not being concentrated in Tangshan to avoid temporary issues, he said. After the takeover, Song will telegraph a report on the proceedings. The Tangshan consolidated tax and business tax bureaus will be collected by Li's side until the end of the month. Song has telegraphed to dispatch personnel to Tangshan to prepare for the takeover next month. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tangshan) Fengrun County Magistrate Zhang Renli, Changli County Magistrate Liang Yu, Funing County Magistrate Liu Xingpei, and Qian'an County Magistrate Lu Fachen arrived in Tangshan by car together at 1:00 PM on the 25th. The Public Security Bureau sent personnel to welcome them. After Zhang and others got out of the car, they went to the Qixin Building to meet with Committee Members Xue and Lei. Subsequently, Xue Lei accompanied Zhang and others to Jiaoda headquarters to meet with Li to discuss the reception of the counties. Li expressed his approval and guaranteed that there would be no accidents during the handover. It was decided that the eastern counties would be received simultaneously from the 27th. After a quick conversation lasting about an hour, they bid farewell. At 4:45 PM in the afternoon, Lu, Liu, and Liang returned to Tianjin by car, while Zhang remained in Tangshan. It was decided that he would go to Fengrun on the 26th to conduct a preliminary inspection. If the handover could be carried out that day, he would officially take office; otherwise, it would be implemented simultaneously on the following day. This reporter met the three county magistrates at the station. According to them, the meeting with Li was harmonious, and it was decided that the handover of the counties would be carried out on the same day from the 27th. At about 4:00 AM on the morning of the same day, the county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs of the eastern counties, along with several hundred newly organized police teams from the province, departed from Tianjin on two special trains, expected to arrive in Tangshan before noon, and then head east from Tangshan, disembarking at the stations along the way to take over. It is expected that the counties along the Beining line can be reached on the same day, while Qian'an may be slightly delayed, but it is uncertain. Further discussions covered the policy guidelines after the takeover of the counties, with the most important thing being to focus on the four characters of "rest and recuperation for the people" before considering any other work. The organization of the county government was also discussed, and it was decided to follow the new method, abolishing the three bureaus of finance, education, and construction, and merging them into the county government, leaving only the Public Security Bureau to increase administrative efficiency. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tangshan) Li Jichun's troops have decided to be reorganized into a security police force, with the establishment determined to be two general teams, with Zhao Lei and Wang Tie serving as the two team leaders, divided into eight large detachments, including infantry, cavalry, and special service teams. The reorganization and training will be implemented after the completion of the dismissal of the remaining personnel. Along the Beining line between Tangshan and Yu, the Japanese army has not fully withdrawn, belonging to the Hattori 14th Brigade, with the brigade headquarters set up in Yuguan. It is said that the Japanese side is quite inclined to station a large detachment in Tangshan to protect traffic under the name of the Sino-Japanese Treaty. Currently, Tangshan has a Tangshan Garrison Department and a Beining Garrison Command. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The county magistrates of the eastern counties departed from Tianjin today, including Yu Tian, Dong Zihua, Fengrun Zhang Renli, Luan County Zhang Jinchen, Leting Guan Gengqin, Changli Liang Yu, Funing Liu Xingpei, Lulong Chen Cengshi, Qian'an Lu Fachen, Linyu Yin Shousong. Nine hundred security team members dispatched by the Tangshan and Tianjin Public Security Bureaus also departed with them. The counties east of Luan need to contact Li Jichun in Tangshan. The Japanese army in Miyun, the 8th Division, has withdrawn beyond the Great Wall and returned to Chengde. There are only two Japanese platoons in Miyun. The Japanese army will fully withdraw as soon as we take over Miyun. The Japanese army on the Great Wall still has more than a hundred garrison troops in Tangshan, who will gradually withdraw after our takeover. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tangshan Public Security Bureau Chief Song Naigan telegraphed the provincial government, reporting that he had successfully taken over at 10:00 AM on the 25th. The magistrates of ten eastern counties, including Ninghe, Luan County, Fengrun, Yutian, Leting, Changli, Qian'an, Lulong, Funing, and Linyu, went to Tangshan on the morning of the 25th, met with Li Jichun with introductions from Xue Zhiheng and Lei Rong, and discussed the takeover procedures. It was decided that they would return to Tianjin on the evening of the 25th, and at 12:00 AM on the night of the 26th, they would board a train prepared by the Railway Bureau, accompanied by the public security bureau chiefs and accompanying personnel, as well as the security team, to Tangshan. On the morning of the 27th, Li Jichun will send personnel to accompany them on separate routes to assist in the handover. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Tangshan on the afternoon of the 25th stated that Song Naigan took over the Public Security Bureau at 10:00 AM this morning. The former director, Gao Xixian, personally arrived to hand over the affairs clearly. Li Jichun sent representatives to participate, and the ceremony was grand. After Song received the seal, he personally raised the blue sky and white sun flag, and the crowd applauded and cheered. The puppet government affairs hall has ended, and the tax collection agencies in the counties have also begun to end, and will be cancelled by the end of this month. It was decided that Li's troops will be reorganized and dismissed on the 26th, 27th, and 28th, and the surplus personnel will be transported to Jinpu Road for disbandment. The dispute over Li's term as chairman of the Reorganization and Dismissal Committee, whether it will be two months or six months, remains unresolved. The 8,000 yuan budget for the Chairman's Office has not yet been approved by the provincial government meeting. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming led the county magistrates of Miyun, Zunhua, and Ji County this morning, traveling by car to Miyun to meet with Suzuki, the brigade commander of the Japanese army. They are expected to return to Ping in the afternoon. It was decided that they will go again tomorrow with the security police to begin the takeover. The takeover of Tangshan has been postponed repeatedly, and it is still difficult to predict whether it can be implemented today. In addition to those who have been transferred to Yutian, a small number of Shi Yousan's troops are still stationed around Qindao. The deadline for the reorganization of the puppet army is scheduled for two months, but due to the complicated procedures, it may be difficult to complete by then, and it may be extended for three months. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The reorganization and dismissal of Li Jichun's puppet army began yesterday. The four units of the puppet army are concentrated in Xugezhuang, Tangshan, Luan County, and Beidaihe. There is also a unit in Fengrun. The reorganization and dismissal expenses have been remitted to Tangshan by the Receiving Committee, totaling 140,000 yuan in the first installment and 100,000 yuan in the second installment, for a total of 240,000 yuan, still based on the plan of reorganizing 4,000 and dismissing 6,000. The end date of the reorganization and dismissal is expected to be completed within about half a month. In the future, the Ji Provincial Government will also gather 4,000 security police and organize them into the first team of the war zone garrison. The puppet army that is reorganized and retained will be the second team. The deployment locations of the first team will be directly controlled by the provincial government, while the second team will be designated to be stationed in Luan County and Fengrun. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qian Zongze telegraphed that he had received a notice from the Tangshan line area commander that the first train of luggage for transporting the dismissed troops would be loaded from Tangshan on the 26th, the second and third trains would be loaded from Luan County on the 27th, and the fourth train would be loaded from Xugezhuang on the 28th, still according to the original plan, and then transported to Machang. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The provincial government first established a war zone security team general team, which was formed on the 25th, and commissioned Dou as the captain-general, with the rank to be verified. The headquarters of the general team is located in Tangshan. Each county magistrate leads a company to depart, with each company approximately equivalent to an infantry company. The number of personnel, firearms, and uniforms will be issued on the 26th. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The machinery of the Tangshan factory on the Beining Road is scheduled to be transported back to Tangshan on the 26th to resume work. One long-distance telephone line in Tangshan will be repaired first, and it is scheduled to resume telephone service on the 28th.)</p>

Committee members will be dispatched to Tangshan, Tianjin, and Pingbei to take charge separately. Tao Shangming for the Pingbei area, Yin Tong and Wei Jian for Tianjin, and Lei Shourong and Xue Zhiheng for Tangshan. The director of the Public Security Bureau commissioned by the Tangshan puppet army has completed the handover. The takeover by our side's director, Song Naigan, has been slightly suspended due to procedural issues, but in fact, it is considered to have been received. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The takeover of the Luandong war zone has now been postponed again. It seems difficult to start before Wednesday this week. The difficulty in the Tangshan area lies in reorganizing Li Jichun's subordinates and dismissing the remaining puppet troops. However, according to the China Telegraph Administration Bureau, the telegraph bureaus along the Beining Road, such as Lutai, Tangshan, Changli, and Qinhuangdao, have already begun operations, and the Beidaihe telegraph bureau may begin operations on Wednesday or Thursday.

<p>(Beiping) The Chahar Bureau is in a state of stagnation while awaiting the Lushan Conference to decide on a solution. The PingSui line is tranquil. Song is still at his private residence. The troops filling the defense of Chahar were originally under the command of Pang, but due to environmental reasons, Pang plans to resign from the command and plans to come to Ping in the short term. Pang sent Deputy Army Commander Ma Fawu to Ping yesterday to report to He Yingqin on the troop deployment situation on the PingSui line. Ma visited Song Zheyuan today, and Song sent Qin Decun to meet him on his behalf due to illness. It is rumored that the troops filling the defense have separately organized staff groups from each army to facilitate contact. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhou Yawei said that the issue of changing the organization of the Military Commission is indeed one of the main issues of the Lushan Conference. However, the principle of change is entirely based on saving expenses and improving work efficiency.

Concrete results are expected to be achieved on various issues that urgently need to be resolved. The Lushan Conference also has a plan to deal with the Xinjiang incident.

The 4 million relief bonds issued by the Ji Provincial Government have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for transfer to the Central Government for approval and promulgation, and can be issued in the near future.

<p>(Tianjin) Civil Affairs Department Director Wei Jian said that the War Zone Relief Committee currently has one million yuan, which has been remitted by the Ministry of Finance. It is now planned to withdraw one million yuan from the public bonds to handle emergency relief and distribution procedures. This will be voted on during the meeting. The remaining three million yuan in bonds will be used for agricultural relief. However, it is a drop in the bucket and difficult to allocate fairly. It is hoped that the Central Government will fulfill its previous promise of 20 million yuan so that the farmers in the disaster area can share the benefits. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>Huang Musong is Unrelated to the Incident</p>
<p>Current Situation in Xinjiang Depends on the Central Government</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Wenlong and Sheng Shicai telegraphed Nanjing, translated and presented by Zhang Fengjiu to Chiang and Wang, stating that the solar telegram from the two leaders was deeply appreciated. Wenlong and Shicai were wrongly recommended and took it as their mission to support the central government and protect the local area. All sectors warmly welcomed Chief Commissioner Huang's arrival in Xinjiang. Shicai personally led his troops to suppress Ma Zhongying, also after consulting with Chief Commissioner Huang on the agreed-upon strategy. However, before the departure, Tao Mingyue secretly asked Li Xiaofu to consult with Shicai to seize the position of chairman. After Shicai reprimanded him, Tao incited Shicai to concurrently serve as chairman, but Shicai declined with a few words. Knowing that his conspiracy would be difficult to sell, Tao stirred things up from all sides. After Shicai's departure, he colluded with Chen Zhong and Li Xiaotian in secret. Chen Zhong abruptly returned to the province by plane from the front line under the guise of orders, and Li Xiaotian secretly induced the army to mutiny. After reports from regiment commanders Lu Changlin and Ma Deshan and further investigation, it was confirmed to be true. Fortunately, Shicai returned to the province on a set date, and the matter had not yet taken place. He believed that although Ma Zhongying had been defeated and fled, he had not been completely suppressed, and if there were any changes in the provincial capital, the danger would be unimaginable. As a last resort, he would enforce military law and spare the investigation of other accomplices. Outside rumors inevitably had some misunderstandings about Chief Commissioner Huang. Although after thorough investigation, they were all incited by Tao, Chen, and Li and had nothing to do with Chief Commissioner Huang. Chief Commissioner Huang came to Xinjiang to announce the good intentions of the central government and comfort the people of Xinjiang. The people's hearts were greatly comforted after his arrival, and the border situation became stable. Even those who had previously falsely claimed to be ordered to launch a western expedition were mostly influenced by Ma Zhongying. Since Chief Commissioner Huang's visit, people of all ethnic groups have known that it was a trick of Ma Zhongying's and have mostly eliminated their support and assistance. Chief Commissioner Huang's contribution is truly not small, and it is enough to prove that Xinjiang, isolated outside the border, is barren and impoverished. It cannot stand on its own without relying on the central government for support. Especially now that the local area has been corrupted and almost all of Xinjiang, it is even more impossible to do anything without the assistance of the central government. Wenlong and Shicai are not so foolish as to not understand this. How the central government can thoroughly plan and consolidate the border situation, the duties and others swear to wholeheartedly comply in order to fulfill their heavenly duty. This sincerity and this aspiration can be guaranteed by heaven and earth. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>

Therefore, they requested the central government to quickly remove Liu from his various concurrent positions in order to eliminate obstacles to suppressing the Red bandits and to strictly order the Sichuan armies to break the defense zone system, unify military and political affairs, obey the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression, and command them to quickly send troops to severely suppress the bandits. The number of people who have fled from the bandit areas is over one million. The people in Sichuan are poor and exhausted, and they are unable to provide relief.

When he went abroad, he also told people that he would go by boat today and would fly back by plane in the future. Therefore, he was willing to risk his life and fight against wind, clouds, thunder, and rain, and after several dangers, he was able to reach Beijing. In Europe, he saw the aviation strength of various countries competing with each other, progressing rapidly. The greatness of their combat power was astonishing. Last year, various places were ravaged by Japanese planes, and our air force was unable to resist, which is truly heartbreaking. The 20th century can be said to be an era of aviation development. If our country wants to develop transportation or consolidate national defense, it must develop aviation in order to be effective. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e25">National Defense and National Boundaries <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Geographer Zhang Qiyun recently gave a lecture in Shanghai on national defense education. In his speech, he mentioned four key points of national defense: (1) It should be for the people, not just for the military. (2) It should be for nurturing life, not just for sending people to their deaths. (3) It should be offensive, not just defensive. (4) It should have spirit, not just material resources. Mr. Zhang's lecture was aimed at primary and secondary school teachers attending the lecture, talking about national defense education, which is different from the military's theory of national defense. Therefore, he said so. We are inspired by Mr. Zhang's words to discuss the issue of national defense. We would like to take this opportunity to clarify the relationship between national boundaries and national defense.</p>
<p>What is national defense? To put it simply, it is the strategic defensive defense implemented by a country for the security of its territory. Accordingly, the basis of national defense is the territory of the country. Various defensive methods and equipment are merely plans to secure the territory. There must be boundary lines between the territory of one country and the territory of another country. This boundary line is more than 28,000 li long on land and approximately 16,000 li long along the coast in our China. Deploying land, sea, and air forces and various military equipment along this 44,000 li border and its airspace 10,000 meters above the ground is military national defense. Training the people to fully develop national defense capabilities is national defense education.</p>
<p>The first difficult problem in China's national defense is the failure to secure national boundaries. In other words, the power of the state cannot reach the entire national border. In the past, there was the so-called Jiandao issue in the Northeast, the Pianma Jiangxinpo dispute in the Southwest, and the Xisha Islands incident in the southern territorial waters. Now, all four northeastern provinces have fallen to the Japanese. As for the nine islands in the South China Sea, there are also reports of the French planting flags. The situation on the border is beyond description. Many treaty ports, such as Tianjin and Shanghai, have foreign troops stationed there. Foreign warships travel freely in the Yangtze River and along the coast. Under such circumstances, talking about securing the territory is impossible. The bitterness of the January 28th Shanghai battle last year and the military actions on the Beining Railway this year only confirm what enlightened people already knew. The second difficult problem in China's national defense is the vague and weak concept of national boundaries among the authorities and the common people. "The larger the area of a country, the less attention its people pay to its borders" is indeed an immutable theorem. However, the vagueness and weakness of the Chinese people's concept of national borders are unprecedented. How many people can clearly know the location of the names of the Chinese borders recorded in the land section of the Shenbao Yearbook? How much can we rely on the maps that have been published? We dare not say. Because of the vague and weak concept of national borders among the people, the authorities inevitably abandon territory without the slightest hesitation. If territory is not valued, how can we talk about national defense? If we want to truly engage in military national defense today, we must start with making the power of the state able to reach the entire national border. If we want to talk about national defense education, we must start with making the people pay attention to national boundaries. We hold such views, hoping that domestic geographers will make efforts.</p>

<p>Gengzi Indemnity Used for the Zhanglong Railway Line</p>
<p>Japan Believes It Violates Treaty</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from Takeushi, acting consul in Xiamen, Fujian Province, received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Li Qingquan, Lin Rongsen, and Lin Dingren, members of the preparation committee for the Zhanglong Railway in Fujian Province, recently agreed with the Nanjing government to borrow 300,000 pounds from the 500,000 pounds of the Boxer Indemnity. The preparation committee held a meeting on the 15th and decided to raise funds. Li Qingquan went to Manila again, intending to return to China in mid-August. His purpose seems to be to borrow American capital. According to other sources, the committee plans to purchase rails, sleepers, machinery, and vehicles from the United Kingdom and hire British technicians when necessary. The Japanese government believes that Fujian Province is across from Taiwan and that it signed a treaty with the Qing government on April 22, Meiji 31 (1898), not to cede Fujian Province. Therefore, it believes that the above plan violates the spirit of the treaty and is monitoring the attitude of the Chinese government. (25th Japan Union Telegram)</p>

Five hundred experts, mostly without political minds, gathered together to closely study the difficult problems they had been working on for ten years. This is very gratifying, he said.

<p>Pittman's Pleased Remarks</p>
<p>(London) US representative Pittman told a Reuters reporter today that the silver agreement reached at the World Economic Conference will be one of the greatest stimulants to world trade. Half of the world today only knows silver coins. If the price of silver rises, those who use silver coins will benefit. The current price of silver is only half of what it should be. The stabilization of the price of silver can help China pay its debts and help China in many other ways, he said. Pittman also praised the support of Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen and Indian representatives, saying that he is confident that they will be able to achieve an agreement given their spirit of cooperation.

<p>(New York) The New York silver market believes that the silver agreement reached at the London World Economic Conference is the most constructive development since Pittman proposed the use of silver to pay off war debts in Congress. Those who explain the agreement say that the silver market will only need to absorb the new silver produced from the mines in the next four years. Compared with the large amount of silver stored in India and other places, this move is indeed rewarding. Although the agreement does not specify the exact ratio of silver used as part of the reserve by the signatory countries, the public believes that this is not important, given the silver agreement and the stable impact of the market conditions. However, in the near future, there will eventually be a convention on the exact ratio of silver. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e44">Roosevelt's Speech on Recovery Plan <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Industrialists Must Shorten Working Hours</p>
<p>Increase Wages to Increase National Purchasing Power</p>
<p>National Washington Telegram, 24th US President Roosevelt stated in his speech tonight that a country cannot achieve lasting prosperity if half of its families are wealthy and half are desperately poor. Roosevelt's speech aimed to outline his achievements and frankly advise the national industrial leaders. Therefore, he clearly explained the government's intention. If all national industries can fully cooperate with the government, like farmers destroying cotton fields, then the unemployed can all find work and no one will feel economic pain. If working hours can be shortened, excessive production can be avoided. If wages can be increased reasonably according to the situation of various industries, then national purchasing power can be increased in a short period of time, so that unemployment and economic pain will disappear. Roosevelt also stated that since there have recently been comments on the government's economic plan, believing that it is too broad and therefore difficult to succeed, he stated the government's various measures and asked the people to judge them. He said that the Democratic Party's larger guarantees have been fulfilled one by one. The government's first priority is to reduce expenditure and balance the budget. Now government expenditure has been reduced by 100 million yuan per year, and the budget has also been balanced. The country's credit has also been preserved at the same time. Regarding the preservation of credit, after the government implemented the home loan and rural loan programs, it resolved the crisis of farmers and homeowners clearing mortgages, and the people's credit was also preserved. At present, the national banks have been placed on a more solid foundation than before, and their business has also returned to normal. The government knew early on that the recovery plan could not be done in piecemeal fashion, so it planned to allocate 330 million yuan to public works and 5 million yuan to subsidize state unemployment relief. The government's steps to expand the monetary base were to fulfill the Democratic Party's guarantee to supply the country with sufficient and sound currency, and this expansion movement has made a real contribution to economic recovery. Roosevelt then discussed raising prices, saying that there has been great progress, and that nearly two million unemployed workers have regained employment. However, in order to continue to progress, there must be selfless cooperation from the people of the country, and this kind of selfless cooperation is especially important when implementing rural and industrial recovery programs today. Various industries must shorten working hours and increase wages. There is no other way to see prosperity again. Moreover, the increase in wages must be slightly faster than prices, because if prices do not have real purchasing power as their backing, then their increase will become artificial and unsustainable, etc. According to reports, the US president's clear advice to industrialists to shorten working hours and increase wages is due to a survey of the national industrial situation by officials of the Industrial Recovery Administration, which showed that those engaged in the manufacture of finished goods are in a far better situation than those engaged in the production of raw materials.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industries' response to the inquiry from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce states: "The Chinese Patent Law has not yet been revised and promulgated, therefore foreign patented products have no patent rights under Chinese jurisdiction." Minister Chen explained that this instruction absolutely cannot be construed as granting Chinese merchants special rights to imitate foreign patented products. The Provisional Regulations for Encouraging Industrial Technology, promulgated on November 30, 1932, clearly stipulate in Article 1 that "Any citizen of the Republic of China who first invents an industrial product or method may apply for an award in accordance with these regulations." If it is found that the product or method has already been patented by others in China or abroad, or if interested parties raise objections or provide conclusive evidence, the Ministry will not grant a patent. If a registration has been obtained by mistake, it shall be revoked. This instruction is based on the Sino-American Commercial Treaty of 1903. Article 10 of that treaty clearly states that for inventions by American citizens, patent rights can only be recognized after China has established a patent law and a dedicated patent office, and approval has been obtained in accordance with the law. The issue of patent law is currently under investigation based on precedents from various countries, with the aim of establishing it soon so that the patent office can be established as soon as possible to comply with the treaty and allow foreign merchants to obtain patent rights in accordance with the law. Even before the patent law is formulated and promulgated, if domestic citizens apply for awards in accordance with the regulations of the Industrial Encouragement Law, and it is found that they are clearly imitating foreign patented products, or if interested parties raise objections, patents will not be granted. This implicitly contains the intention of protecting the patent rights of foreign merchants. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industries' response to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's inquiry regarding whether foreign merchants have patents in China stated that the Chinese Patent Law has not yet been revised and promulgated, therefore foreign patented products have no patent rights under Chinese jurisdiction. A responsible person from the Ministry of Industries explained the instruction, stating that Chinese merchants cannot enjoy the special right to imitate foreign patented products as a result of this instruction. The Provisional Regulations for Encouraging Industrial Technology, promulgated last November, stipulate that citizens can apply for awards in accordance with the regulations, but if the applied-for product has already been patented by others in China or abroad, or if interested parties raise objections, the patent will be revoked. Furthermore, this instruction is based on Article 10 of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty of 1903, which stipulates that for inventions by American citizens, patents can only be granted after China has established a patent law and a dedicated patent office and obtained approval in accordance with the law. The Ministry of Industries is currently investigating precedents, formulating patent laws, and establishing a dedicated patent office as soon as possible so that foreign merchants can also obtain patent rights.

<p>Records of Separate Trials by Army and Navy</p>
<p>Dentsu Tokyo, 25th: The public trial of Goto Eihan and others, defendants in the May 15 Incident on the army side, began after Prosecutor Hiyosaka read the facts of the prosecution. Goto Eihan was then questioned. Legal Officer Shimada examined the facts. Mr. Goto gave a routine statement of his family relations and experiences. The questions and answers between the legal officer and the defendant were as follows: (Q) When did you start the movement to reform the country? (A) In Showa 6, under the guidance of Lieutenant Kanbe, a senior officer, I began to participate in the movement to reform the country by studying the national polity with military personnel. As a result of the study, I realized that the current situation in Japan has many things related to the essence of the national polity, etc., citing the military's admonition to explain. (Q) What are your thoughts on the current society? (A) Political parties tend to pursue party strategies, becoming tools of plutocrats and financial cliques. Therefore, issues such as buying US dollars and military reductions are all like this. In the meantime, small and medium-sized industrialists and the proletariat are suffering from food shortages, so the ministers around the monarch are alienated from us citizens and those above. It is not to criticize American gold worship and communism. (Q) What is the reason for taking direct action? (A) At that time, the Tohoku region was experiencing famine, and the children of poor rural areas were incorporated into the army, and they had the feeling of pulling the hair behind their heads. Following them on expeditions, the financial cliques and politicians were only concerned with their own private interests. Turning to the Sino-Japanese issue and international relations, he bitterly scolded the incompetence and lack of strategy of those in power. After a break at 10:55 AM, the court reopened at 0:10 PM. Mr. Goto continued, "Soldiers who love the country and are loyal will surely rise up one after another." He then stated his awareness of cooperation and compromise with comrades in the navy, saying that he heard that the navy wanted to cooperate, so he compromised, not because of the navy's request. Moreover, from the beginning, the comrades and others had made up their minds. He then spoke in detail about the planning of the incident. The court was adjourned at 2:30 PM.</p>
<p>Dentsu Yokosuka, 25th: On the second day of the naval court-martial, as reported in the evening newspaper, after about ten minutes of non-public trial of Lieutenant Koga, the public trial began at 9:22 AM. Lieutenant Koga's statement was as follows: "The Blood Pledge Corps is the vanguard team to carry out the purpose. Army and navy personnel are the main force of the vanguard. To describe the fundamental spirit of the plan, we will rise up first. If martial law is imposed, the entire army will surely rise up. I am convinced that the country can be reformed because of the military's uprising. Araki, the Minister of the Army, will be the head, and a military government will be established as the first stage of reforming the national power. We, who act in military uniforms, are acting in the name of the children of His Majesty the Emperor." At 11:30 AM, a break was announced. The court reopened at 1:00 PM. Lieutenant Koga continued, "In mid-May, during the special Diet session, we planned to attack the Diet. The plan was to hide bombs in our loincloths (i.e., in the lower hanging cloth) and throw them in when the Diet was in session to cause chaos. At the same time, a team outside the Diet would attack. However, because security was tight at the time, the plan failed." The court was adjourned at 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>Hualian Tokyo, 25th: The first public trial of the army assassins Goto Eihan and the other ten defendants in the May 15 Incident is scheduled to be held this morning at the military court of the Aoyama Division. Only 20 general spectators are allowed to enter the courtroom, and 26 special spectators are designated: 8 from the Tokyo Gendarmerie Headquarters, 6 from the Ministry of the Army, 2 from the General Staff Headquarters, 5 from the Ministry of Justice, 4 from the Ministry of the Navy, and 1 from the Tokyo Garrison Headquarters. Chief Judge Nishimura held a judges' meeting yesterday afternoon, believing that the case was serious. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the judges' group went to Meiji Shrine to pray, seeking the protection of the gods. Because Tokyo City is a hotbed of fascism, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has convened a special police team to guard the roads and the Aoyama Division in case of emergency.</p>

<p>(National Washington, 24th) British geologist Woodworth presented a paper at the Geological Congress today, detailing the results of his geological surveys in Africa, stating that mankind originated in Africa. This is because human remains and evidence of human existence have been found in the older geological structures in Africa. The composition of the geology is much older than the site where "Peking Man" was discovered, which shows that the theory held by Osborne and Andrew that mankind originated in Asia is not yet credible history.</p>

This was done throughout the country by the police, the auxiliary team of the National Socialist Party, and the stormtroopers, acting on orders from the Berlin secret police.

The non-National Socialist Party election office has received letters complaining that those participating in the election from the National Socialist Party used coercion and interfered with the voting of the non-National Socialist Party.

<p>With Important Political Mission</p>
<p>National Hungarian Capital, 24th: Hungarian Prime Minister Gombos and Foreign Minister Kanya, accompanied by senior officials and economic experts, left here tonight for Italy and are expected to arrive in Rome around 11:30 tomorrow morning. Authorities here all acknowledge that Mr. Gombos and others are on a very important mission this time. Mr. Gombos personally stated that Hungary has no intention of developing a closer relationship with the Little Entente countries unless the Little Entente countries can give them complete equality and guarantee the revision of the peace treaty. Hungary will not engage in any kind of negotiations, and the rumors that Mr. Gombos has already held consultations with Czech Foreign Minister Beneš and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu have been denied by Mr. Gombos. As for Hungary's intervention in the dispute between Germany and Austria, or the establishment of close economic and political coordination with Austria, all are unfounded. The real purpose of this trip by Mr. Gombos and others is to discuss what practical impact the Four-Power Pact has had on Hungary since it was signed. Mr. Gombos will also request Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to intercede with France to revise the Trianon Treaty. It is likely that Mr. Gombos and others will stay for about three days.</p>

<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported on the 13th that the Kwantung anti-aircraft drill is scheduled to be held from August 9th to the dawn of the 11th. This large-scale drill is a major issue that will determine the fate of the empire in future wars with enemy countries. Therefore, the Tokyo Garrison Headquarters, the command of the drill, and the authorities of the General Staff Headquarters and the Ministry of the Army have decided to implement secret air raid defense operations based on realism. However, the air attaché of the US Embassy in Japan, the hypothetical enemy of our country (referring to the United States), has received a secret order from the headquarters of his country to investigate the content of the empire's defense operations and report to the highest leaders of his country's military. Fortunately, this was known to our (Japanese) authorities. Therefore, the central part of the army is very nervous about this kind of international intelligence rush. According to the investigation of our (Japanese) authorities, it attaches great importance to the air defense drill in the capital. Since the announcement of the air defense drill plan in the Kwantung region this spring, a great effort has been made to investigate the air raid defense plan of Greater Tokyo. At the same time, Japanese people are hired as guides or internal spies to search for secret information. Therefore, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and related authorities have recently held meetings to discuss preventing the leakage of information.</p>
<p>Japan Cooperates with Us Due to the League of Nations</p>
<h3 id="e90">Sugimura Comes to China to Supervise <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>But It is Still Undetermined Whether to Allow the Appointment</p>
<p>According to the Osaka Asahi Shimbun on the 21st, the League of Nations has dispatched Dr. Rajchman, Director of Health, to plan everything in order to assist the Chinese government. In order to formulate countermeasures, our government authorities have sought opinions from various parties. After repeated consultations, everyone agreed that Japan has already declared its withdrawal from the League, so it cannot notify the League and ask the League to reflect on itself. Therefore, it has no choice but to directly dispatch knowledgeable politicians and diplomats to China to supervise China's attitude towards Japan and take all necessary measures. In China, Yangta郎 Sugimura, who participated in international politics at the Secretariat of the League of Nations (former Deputy Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the League of Nations),</p>
<p>(is the most familiar. Sugimura and Rajchman have a very close friendship,</p>
<p>and he also gets along very well with the League of Nations faction of the Chinese government, so that he can convey Japan's opinions and alleviate the anti-Japanese sentiments of the Chinese government. This person is the most suitable. However, it is still uncertain whether Sugimura will agree to this important task. When Sugimura returned to Japan from Geneva, he expressed his hope to go to China to inspect the situation in China and Manchuria. Therefore, Foreign Minister Uchida believed that Sugimura would not refuse this mission. However, Sugimura's opinion is: "The current situation cannot be moved by the strength of one or two people. Rajchman's actions after arriving in China are very important to Japan's relations. In addition to the Second Washington Conference and the revision of the Japan-Russia Fisheries Treaty, etc., our country's withdrawal from the League is scheduled for 1935, that is, in the next year or two. At this time, we should devote our efforts to establish various plans. Not only the Japanese government, but also private organizations and groups, are unanimously planning to implement the purpose." Judging from this statement, he seems unwilling to take on the responsibility. At present, government officials attach great importance to Sugiyama's intentions. Foreign Minister Uchida is particularly enthusiastic about considering follow-up measures in order to seek fundamental countermeasures. It is expected that Sugiyama will not firmly refuse, etc.</p>

<p>Wang Arrives in Guling, Discusses Various Issues That Evening</p>
<p>Zhu Peide and Others Are Also Summoned to the Lushan Conference, Wang Yitang Also Arrives in Guling for Extensive Discussions with Chiang</p>
<p>Jiujiang Dispatch: Premier Wang, due to the importance of all central government affairs, needed to confer with Chairman Chiang. However, Chiang was occupied with managing the military academy and overseeing bandit suppression in Lushan, unable to return to Nanjing. Therefore, in response to Chiang's telegram invitation, Premier Wang, along with Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu, Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming, Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua, and Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan, departed Nanjing on the "Ninghai" warship on the 21st, heading west. On the 22nd, they arrived in Jiujiang around 10:00 AM. After landing and briefly resting, they traveled by car to Lianhua Cave and then by sedan chair, arriving at Guling at 3:00 PM that afternoon. That evening, they met with Chairman Chiang, President Dai, Huang Shaohong (who had just arrived in Lushan from Hankou), and other central committee members in Lushan at Chiang's private residence. Wang reported on the recent situations and measures taken regarding Party affairs, politics, and the current state of affairs at the central government. Chiang also reported on recent military developments and the bandit suppression efforts in five provinces. Discussions also covered the aftermath of receiving the North China war zone, the incorporation of puppet troops, and disaster relief in affected areas. The most important topics were the resolution of the Chahar incident and corresponding measures. Further joint efforts with the Southwest to suppress Zhu De and Mao Zedong and eradicate the Red bandits were also thoroughly studied.</p>
<p>In recent days, those who have come to Lushan in response to Chiang's telegram invitations include Zhu Peide, Director of the Military Affairs Commission's Third Hall; Tang Shengzhi, President of the Military Council; Chen Yi, Vice Minister of Military Administration; Yang Jie, Principal of the Central Military Academy; and dozens of senior generals such as Zhang Zhizhong. They are all participating in the military conference convened by the Military Affairs Commission. The formal conference will last approximately three to five days, discussing the reorganization and training of national troops and local defense, similar in nature to the bandit suppression military conference Chiang convened in Nanchang some time ago. (Evening of July 22)</p>
<p>Guling Dispatch: Chairman Chiang has repeatedly sent letters and telegrams inviting Wang Yitang to come south and even dispatched personnel north to urge him. It was said that Wang was unable to make the trip due to various matters. Recently, after Wang arrived in Shanghai, he was directly and indirectly urged again and again via telegrams. Wang finally arrived in Guling the day before yesterday. Coincidentally, Chiang had previously gone to southern mountains to inspect troops and rushed back yesterday. Refraining from using a vehicle, he personally went to visit Wang, encountering him on the way. They walked together, engaging in prolonged and extensive discussions. That evening, Chiang hosted Wang for dinner at his villa until late at night, sending Wang back to his residence in Dalinchong by sedan chair. It is commendable that Chiang, amidst the pressing affairs of military life, did not forget to respect the virtuous. (July 22)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Tianjin Communists Reform <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Wang Baozhong and Others Awaken and Return</p>
<p>There Are Only a Hundred or So Communists in Tianjin</p>
<p>Tianjin Special Dispatch: In recent years, the Yangtze River region has been plagued by the Communists, causing immense suffering. Communism is also beginning to sprout and grow in North China. However, the people of the North possess a robust character and deeply ingrained traditional moral values. Coupled with the strict enforcement of arrests by the police, the Communists find it difficult to operate freely. Only local labor strikes exhibit slight red undertones. Therefore, aside from ordinary workers who are easily tempted due to the hardships of life, it is the youth from middle schools and universities who feel frustrated due to their inability to find employment in society. Furthermore, with their weak willpower, they fall into the trap once lured. Earlier this month, the activities of the so-called "Tianjin Municipal Guidance Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League" were discovered. The Tianjin Municipal Party Department of the Kuomintang, in conjunction with the Special Task Force of the Public Security Bureau, conducted a thorough investigation and lured Wu Peicang, the Standing Committee Member and Secretary of the League, from the concession area to Chinese territory and arrested him. Wu confessed that the organization's headquarters were located at a certain address on Jinyiwei Bridge. Police detectives were immediately dispatched to the location, where they captured Wang Baozhong, a member of the Standing Committee, and Zhang Lihua (female, original name Dong Qirong), a branch administrator. Subsequently, based on their confessions, they successively arrested Liu Yazhai, the secretary of the branch at the Higher Industrial School and secretary of the Anti-Imperialist branch; Liu Senlin, the acting secretary of the branch at the Higher Industrial School; Wu Tianmin, the secretary of the street branch; Zhang Zhenmin, the leader of the assault team (formerly of the puppet municipal committee); and League members Zhang Zongqian, Zhang Zongjian, Yang Yinshuo, Zhang Zhensheng, and more than ten others. They were detained in the preferential treatment room of the Public Security Bureau. Shao Hua, a member of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Department, interrogated them along with personnel from the Special Task Force. They all confessed to joining the Communist Party without denial. After careful examination, Shao and others found that these individuals were all young, and Wu Peicang and Wang Baozhong were university students with excellent qualifications. It would be regrettable to punish them by law for going astray due to a moment's weakness. Therefore, they explained the fallacies of the Communist Party's heresies and the crimes they had committed in deceiving the masses. They were told that if they could repent, they would be given a path to reform. At this point, they all confessed their innermost feelings, admitting that they had joined due to enticement, curiosity, or the bitterness of life. They had all joined the party around February of this year, and although it had only been half a year, they had gained a complete understanding of the Communist Party's inner workings and expressed their realization. Finally, they completely disclosed the Communist Party's organization and plans in North China. The Municipal Party Department reported this to the Central Government, which approved the issuance of a declaration of withdrawal from the party, pardoning their past actions and allowing them to reform. The Municipal Party Department then held a reception for the press at 3:00 PM on the 22nd, where Wang Baozhong, Wu Cangpei, and others successively reported on various inside stories of the Communist Party. According to Wang Baozhong, there are only about one hundred Communist Party members in Tianjin, mostly students, followed by workers, with very weak influence. It is feared that they will soon naturally dissolve. (July 23)</p>

<p>Jinan Dispatch: At 11:00 PM on the 23rd, a long-distance telephone call from Qingdao reported that Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie, due to the earnest retention by all parties and abandoning his resignation intentions, returned to Qingdao from Weihai by boat on the 21st with Qingdao representatives Song Yuting and others. They arrived in Yantai that day. They were originally scheduled to return to Qingdao via Weixian from Yantai on the 22nd, but because all sectors in Yantai held a welcome meeting, they stayed for a day. It was not until 8:00 AM this morning (the 23rd) that they departed Yantai with the Qingdao representatives, traveling south along the Yantai-Weixian road by car. Rong Guangxing, Brigade Commander of the Eighty-Seventh Brigade, Zhang Kuiwen, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and representatives from all sectors all went to the bus station to see them off. At noon, Shen and his party arrived in Weixian. Li Wenli, the Magistrate of Weixian County, and representatives of the garrison commander from all sectors all went to the station to welcome them. Shen briefly exchanged greetings with the welcomers, and then boarded two carriages of a reserved special train prepared by the Jiaoji Railway, which were attached to the Jiaoji Railway's sixth train, departing Weixian at 1:08 PM and arriving in Qingdao at 6:30 PM in the afternoon. Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, important party, government, and military figures, consuls from various countries, and representatives from all sectors also went to the station to welcome them. After Shen got off the train, he briefly interacted with the welcomers, then left the station on foot to Zhongshan Road, and then took a car back to his private residence for rest. Qingdao's all sectors, assuming that Shen still intends to resign, sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Premier Wang Jingwei, and Huang Fu and He Yingqin in Peiping today, to retain Shen, requesting them to send a telegram to Shen to dispel his resignation intentions. Also, after Shen arrived in Qingdao, he met with reporters at the station and made a statement, saying, "My resignation from Qingdao this time had unavoidable difficulties. After arriving in Weihai, all parties sent telegrams to retain me, and representatives from this city tracked me down and forced me to return to Qingdao. I am also very grateful for Chairman Han's joint telegram urging me to return, so I had no choice but to return to Qingdao. I am deeply ashamed and uneasy for the trouble everyone has taken to welcome me today. Qingdao still has many difficulties. On the one hand, I will temporarily take responsibility and continue to handle municipal affairs, and on the other hand, I will still resign to the central government and recommend a capable person to take over."

The two directors, Zhang and Yu, were unable to apply funds due to the provincial treasury's shortage and overdue party and government expenses for more than five months, and the matter was related to bandit suppression, so it had to be done. Therefore, they had to borrow 500,000 yuan from all seven banks in Hunan Province to deal with the situation.

<p>Anhui Province</p>
<h3 id="e96">This Year's Budget is Prepared <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Total Revenue and Expenditure Can Barely Match</p>
<p>Anqing Dispatch: The Anhui Provincial 22nd Annual Budget was passed by the Provincial Government Standing Committee last week. The total amount of revenue and expenditure was 11,173,934 yuan, and the revenue and expenditure could barely match. The budget for the previous year was 9,210,000 yuan for both revenue and expenditure. Later, the National Government Accounting Office ordered that the central government's assistance of 1,200,000 yuan be added to the approved revenue and expenditure, which were listed as 10,412,739 yuan. The first draft of this year's budget showed a very large increase in expenditure compared to the previous year, and the budget review committee discussed and stipulated three standards for reduction: (1) The organs that were originally established and had a budget in the previous year shall not exceed the budget amount of the previous year; (2) The organs that were established in the previous year but did not have an additional budget shall be prepared according to the minimum amount; (3) The newly added expenditures in this year shall comply with the instructions of the Headquarters and must first raise funds before increasing. Finally, after repeated reductions and revisions by various agencies, the draft was submitted to the meeting for review, and the total expenditure was still more than 11,100,000 yuan, which was still more than 1,300,000 yuan less than the total revenue of more than 9,800,000 yuan. The capital of the Four Provinces Farmers Bank of 500,000 yuan, the rural cooperative business fee of 120,000 yuan, and the public science museum of more than 70,000 yuan were increased by order of the Headquarters, and the debt fee of more than 560,000 yuan that had been paid in the previous year had to be increased in fact, and the remaining original funds could not be reduced. The only way to consolidate the original income of the Department of Finance is to increase the annual land tax by 250,000 yuan, the business tax by 100,000 yuan, the brokerage tax by 40,000 yuan, the slaughter tax by 70,000 yuan, the livestock fee by 30,000 yuan, the sanitary land price payment by 100,000 yuan, the official property reclamation by 160,000 yuan, and the road construction surcharge by 12,500 yuan, totaling 762,500 yuan, which can be used to offset the previous shortage, but there is still a difference of about 600,000 yuan, so it is planned to issue 600,000 yuan of treasury bills, which are specifically designated for the capital of the Four Provinces Farmers Bank and the rural cooperative business fee. The preparation of the business budget is set at 455,017 yuan, which has been prepared by the Department of Finance in two categories, ordinary business, and submitted to the Provincial Government Standing Committee for approval, and the Department of Finance will rush to prepare a formal budget and submit it to the Headquarters for approval and implementation. As for this year's special construction fee, it is heard that the fee for rice and photos has been cut off, and there is no designated fund to point to, and it is heard that the two departments of finance and construction will negotiate separately on handling it.

<p>Li Yihua, a seawall patrolman of the seawall works department in this county's Pudong area, was instructed by the Department of Construction and the county government that there would be a hurricane passing through on the 22nd and 23rd, and that the seawall works should be carefully protected, and the county government sent technician Zhao Shuda to the worksite to make arrangements. Unexpectedly, the seawall in that area was hit by a hurricane on the morning of the 22nd, originating from the southeast, and became more rampant in the evening. The patrolman immediately led more than 30 workers to rescue the seawall. The flood was almost level with the seawall surface, and the danger was very serious. The first to fifth sections were the most important. They used pre-set sacks filled with mud to selectively fill the gaps and depressions to make up for them. They worked all night, and the seawall danger subsided when the tide receded and the wind slowed down on the 23rd.</p>

Yesterday afternoon, they convened a temporary member meeting and resolved: (1) Send a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce to forward a letter to the collection office to strive to maintain the original amount; (2) Before obtaining a satisfactory reply from the collection office, in accordance with the methods of the same industry in various counties, each firm shall send the original paid license tax amount to the guild for transfer to the County Chamber of Commerce for preservation to maintain the national tax, and at the same time request the County Chamber of Commerce to forward a letter to the collection office to exempt the overdue reminder fee, and request the Public Security Bureau to forward a letter to all branches to suspend sending police to assist in the collection before the tax amount is resolved. After the discussion, they immediately sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce to forward a letter to the collection office to strive for it.</p>

A woman named Huang rented a room in their house, and Huang had a beautiful daughter named Qibao. Xingzhen was envious and jealous of Qibao's poverty and often mocked her. The other day, Xingzhen's wickedness resurfaced, and she started a fight. Ke Xu helped her daughter and tore off Qibao's trousers. Onlookers applauded and laughed. Qibao, feeling ashamed and indignant, committed suicide by swallowing raw opium that day. The next day, the authorities were notified for an autopsy. The officials believed that Ke and Xingzhen were suspected of forcing her to death and immediately arrested them. Ke Xu was released on bail. The shops and neighborhoods believe that Ke Xu is violent and is still free from justice, so the community is upset and drafted an official complaint today and are requesting strict legal action from the county government.</p>

<p>Qi Zhongbao, a farmer from No. 6 Caoshe, Kuoshi Banqiao, West Lake, discovered that his daughter, Xu Qi, was having an affair with a monk named Xinkong. The farmhand Shen Afa caught them. Qi preemptively attacked, brutally killing Shen with thirteen cuts from a kitchen knife and burying the body in the vegetable garden to cover up the crime. The crime was leaked by a temporary worker, Qi Demao, and the police unearthed the body. The perpetrators were arrested and sent to court for trial. After investigation, it was determined that Qi Zhongbao was already seventy years old and could not have killed the strong and robust Shen Afa. His son, Amao, had a knife wound on his finger, making him undoubtedly the actual perpetrator of the murder. Qi Xu was also a co-conspirator in the murder. Both were charged with the crime of joint homicide under Articles 42 and 282 of the Criminal Law and were prosecuted according to law. Xu Zhan's adultery with monk Xinkong could not be substantiated, and she was declared innocent and granted immunity from prosecution.</p>

<p>Local News: Navy's Domestically Made Jiangque Aircraft</p>
<h3 id="e105">Flew from Nanjing to Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Landed at Hongqiao Airport, Welcomed by All Sectors</p>
<p>Will Continue Northward Flight After Replacing New Engine</p>
<p>Will Fly Back to Shanghai from Beiping, Then Fly South to Hong Kong and Guangdong</p>
<p>Chen Wenlin, Director of the Xiamen Naval Aviation Department of the Ministry of the Navy, accompanied by Pan Dingxin, Head of the Mechanical Section, flew the domestically-made military land-based training and reconnaissance aircraft Jiangque, departing from Xiamen on the 20th and flying across the country via Fuzhou, Wenzhou, and Liyang. They arrived in Nanjing on the 21st. Due to slight engine damage, repairs were completed yesterday morning. They took off from Nanjing at 2:45 PM yesterday and arrived at Hongqiao Airport at 4:50 PM. They are scheduled to stay in Shanghai for three weeks, replace the 120-horsepower engine, and then fly north. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived at Hongqiao</p>
<p>Director Chen and Section Chief Pan departed from Xiamen on the 20th, passed through Fuzhou, Wenzhou, etc., and arrived in Nanjing on the 21st. They originally planned to fly to Shanghai the next day, but after inspecting the aircraft, they found that the engine was slightly damaged. They worked to repair it, and it was completed yesterday morning. They left Nanjing for Shanghai at 2:45 PM in the afternoon. Between Changzhou and Suzhou, they encountered sudden rain twice, so they ascended to an altitude of 6,000 feet to avoid the rain. They arrived in Shanghai at 4:50 PM and landed at Hongqiao Airport. Few people knew about Chen's flight to Shanghai in advance. Only Zeng Yijing, Director of the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant, Lin Wojiang, Secretary-General of the Aviation Association, and more than a dozen reporters from various newspapers went to welcome them.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Engine Replacement <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>After Director Chen deplaned, Director Zeng invited him to a small room next to the airport for a light refreshment. Then they went back to the airport to watch the performance of the Italian Fiat Company's fighter plane to take pointers from the performance. The Jiangque aircraft's current engine is 85 horsepower, which is not suitable for long-distance flights. Therefore, it has been decided to replace it with a 120-horsepower engine in Shanghai. The engine has been selected by the British Far East Aircraft Company and will be replaced by personnel from the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant here. It will take about three weeks to complete the installation. Director Chen and Section Chief Pan are currently at the Naval Entertainment Club and will wait for the engine replacement to be completed before continuing to fly to North and South China to complete the feat of circumnavigating the country.</p>
<h3 id="e107">A Glimpse of the Fuselage <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangque aircraft fuselage is painted silver. The upper wing has the Blue Sky with a White Sun emblem. At the rear, the rudder has vertical stripes of blue and white. On both sides of the front of the fuselage are the emblems of the Naval Aviation Department. On both sides of the rear of the fuselage are the words "Jiangque." The upper and lower wings are staggered, unlike the parallel upper and lower wings of foreign aircraft. The fuselage is extremely light. One person holding the tail can push it quickly. The entire aircraft is constructed with extraordinary precision.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Cost 10,000 Yuan <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The total cost of manufacturing this aircraft is about 10,000 yuan, which is one-third cheaper than foreign aircraft. If more are built, it can be even cheaper. After it was completed this month, the team decided to make a long-distance flight across the country to attract people's attention so that the Chinese people could witness the state of domestically made aircraft. After the first test flight, the results were excellent. The people of Hong Kong also came to Xiamen to visit. On the morning of the 20th, Director Chen and Section Chief Pan departed from Xiamen on the aircraft, passed through Fuzhou and Wenzhou, and reached Liyang, Jiangsu, staying overnight. They flew to Nanjing on the 21st.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Aircraft Manufacturing Process <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, our reporter at the airport interviewed Chen Wenlin. Chen, wearing a naval uniform, was humble, energetic, and about thirty years old. He was indeed a promising young man. He introduced Pan Dingxin and spoke eloquently about the process of manufacturing the aircraft. Chen said, "Section Chief Pan and I were classmates in Germany. Seeing that most of our country's aircraft were purchased from Europe and the United States, we worked hard to study and design in detail. Section Chief Pan has special expertise in mechanical engineering, and we finally succeeded. Therefore, the style is different from imported products in several places, but it is more convenient and sophisticated." All materials, except those that our country lacks, are made domestically. The engine was dismantled from the Xiamen aircraft, which I flew back to China from Germany four years ago. The others are newly built. It took about three months, and only five or six people were manufacturing during breaks. If we raise special funds and hire workers to build, the time can be shortened."</p>
<h3 id="e110">Staying in Shanghai for Three Weeks <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>After arriving in Nanjing, we originally planned to fly to Shanghai immediately, but the engine was slightly damaged, so we stayed in Nanjing for repairs. It was repaired this morning (yesterday morning) and arrived here at 4:45 PM in the afternoon, taking only two hours. The aircraft is 85 horsepower. If it is replaced with a more than 100 horsepower engine, the flight will be faster. The fuselage is more than twice as light as foreign goods, so turning up and down during flight is particularly fast, which is very satisfying. It is planned to stay in Shanghai for three weeks to replace the 120-horsepower engine.</p>

<p>After the installation is complete, the team will fly north, scheduled to go through Bengbu, Xuzhou, Jinan, and reach Peiping. From Peiping, the team will fly to Tianjin, Qingdao, and return to Shanghai, then fly south, passing through Xiamen, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other places to complete the nationwide flight. I hope that the people of the whole country will jointly advocate the self-production of aircraft, then we can plug loopholes, and the country's strength is hopeful."</p>

<p>Finally, the reporter asked about the news of Sun Tonggang, the aviator who recently flew from Germany to Beijing. According to Chen, "I met Sun twice in Beijing. Sun's long-distance flight from Germany back to the motherland was indeed arduous. I also flew the Xiamen aircraft from Germany along this route four years ago. Sun and I studied aviation in Germany and were classmates. When I left Germany, Sun had just arrived in Germany to study German. Now Sun plans to fly to Jinan within a few days to visit relatives. His flight route is not planned to go through Shanghai."</p>
<p>Kan En, Foreign Exchange Broker</p>
<h3 id="e114">Views on the Silver Agreement <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Limited Benefits for Relevant Parties</p>
<p>Little Impact on the Shanghai Market</p>
<p>The Ta Mei Wan Bao reported that Kan En, a foreign exchange broker in this city, is known among foreigners as an authority on silver. Recently, he expressed his opinion on the silver agreement of the World Economic Conference, believing that the signing of the agreement still has limited benefits for those related to silver. A world conference should not only focus on such one agreement, which must be regarded as a great achievement, but its actual benefits are also limited. It cannot achieve unexpected results for silver. The so-called sacrifices made by Spain, India, and China are not real sacrifices. India has always sold no more than 35 million ounces of silver a year. Now it is allowed to sell this quota every year. Spain has never exported silver, but now it can sell 5 million ounces every year. China has not actually exported silver in terms of import and export differences, except for the past six months. Moreover, one point that has not been paid attention to in the agreement is that speculators in New York currently hold 122.5 million ounces of silver. Once they dump it on the market, it will be like dropping a bomb. As for the agreement's impact on the Shanghai market, it will have little impact, partly because its impact has been preemptively offset and partly because its effect is not sufficient to guarantee the future of silver and its permanent strength. If China believes that this agreement will stabilize the silver market, it is not something that ordinary psychology can understand. Because the silver price is still fluctuating as before, and how can the silver price be stabilized when the gold price is not stable?</p>
<p>Java Taipan Comes to China</p>
<h3 id="e115">Investigating Commerce in Central Java <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Supplementing Java Sugar Production for Transport to China. Rescuing Shipping in the South Seas</p>
<p>Competing to Transport Northeast Miscellaneous Grains for Export</p>
<p>Java sugar is transported to our country, with annual shipments of hundreds of thousands of tons, selling well in various places north and south of the Yangtze River. However, after the January 28th Incident, imports decreased significantly. After the import tax was increased, Java sugar coming to China declined even more drastically. Shipping was also greatly affected. Mr. J. Nieuwenhuys, General Manager of the Java Shipping Company, came to Shanghai to investigate the commerce of various places in our country in order to prepare to supplement shipping to China. The reasons for the decline of Java sugar are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e116">Decreasing Shipping Volume <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Our country has purchased Java sugar due to years of resisting inferior sugar. The amount transported to Shanghai alone is always between 300,000 and 400,000 tons. The Java Shipping Company specially opened eight South Seas liner ships to transport Java sugar to Shanghai. Before the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, Java Shipping alone transported more than 250,000 tons of Java sugar to Shanghai in the previous year. Last year, various places in our country were affected by the aggression of a strong neighbor, and all industries were depressed. Java sugar also reduced its shipping to China. This year, since the customs increased the import tax on sugar, the tax is more than the sugar price. Those who are managing Java sugar stopped buying. Although the sugar price has repeatedly fallen, because the tax rate is too large, transporting sales to China is encountering greater setbacks. According to Java Shipping Company statistics, the sugar loaded in the first six months of this year is less than 50,000 tons, which is only 30% of the year before. Recently, inferior sugar has been transported along the Yangtze River. Java sugar may become even more depressed in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Limiting Production <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Java regards sugar as the bulk of its production and China as its only market for sales. Now that Java sugar cannot be smoothly transported to China, the sugar factories are piling up with inventory. Although the price has been reduced to 4 guilders per picul, there are few orders due to the heavy tariffs, resulting in a situation of surplus sugar. The Dutch government, in order to help Java sugar merchants, has limited the production volume. It is also planning to sell Java sugar, designating it to be sold exclusively by one company, which is equivalent to a monopoly method, to avoid repeated competition and indiscriminate price drops. After this news spread, most of the Chinese merchants operating sugar in Java rose up in opposition. If this matter is realized, the South Seas sugar merchants will inevitably go bankrupt completely, so this matter has not yet been realized.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Inspecting the Northeast <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The products of our country that are sold to the South Seas Islands are mostly Northeast soybeans, soybean cakes, and miscellaneous grains, all of which are transshipped in Shanghai for export. Since the Northeast was forcibly occupied by Japan, the Northeast soybeans and other goods transported to the South Seas have disappeared from Shanghai due to the tax levied by the puppet state and are now directly transported to Java from Dalian. Japanese ships have taken over 70-80% of the shipping rights. The Java Shipping Company only sends one ship to Dalian per month, and its business has also suffered significant losses. This time, Java Taipan Nieuwenhuys personally went to the Northeast to investigate the export situation of soybeans and miscellaneous grains, preparing to increase the number of ships to compete with Japanese ships and make up for the losses.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Improving Passenger Seats <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Most of the overseas Chinese doing business in the South Seas are from Fujian and Guangdong, so the Java Shipping Company's Xiamen passenger tickets are a huge business. Every time a ship travels to and from Xiamen, there are often three to four hundred overseas Chinese on board. Recently, the Dutch government has increased the head tax for Chinese entering the country to 150 guilders per person. If there is no proper guarantee when entering the country, they are not allowed to land. They must also pay a population donation every year. After the company's ships twice had incidents of crew insulting Chinese passengers, each ship has now authorized each Chinese compradore to improve treatment in order to maintain the business in that port. Today, the Taipan Nieuwenhuys has decided to take the Jinan ship to Xiamen to discuss with the local branch manager the improvement of treatment for Chinese passengers and the convenience of taking ships in order to eliminate the accumulation of bad habits.</p>

<p>Inviting Him to Shanghai</p>
<p>Sun Tonggang, an aviator who studied in Germany, has returned to China after a long-distance flight and has arrived in Nanjing. It is heard that he will go to Jinan, stay for three months, and then go to Germany to continue his studies and practice manufacturing aircraft. Therefore, it is still unknown whether Sun will come to Shanghai. The Chinese Aviation Association in this city believes that Sun's successful long-distance flight has brought great honor to the country and has long planned to launch a grand welcome when he arrives in Shanghai. Now that Sun has arrived in Beijing, there is no news of him coming to Shanghai. Yesterday, they telegraphed Beijing to congratulate him on his success and inquired whether he would come to Shanghai so that the people of this city could admire his demeanor and express their welcome. They are currently waiting for a reply.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Appropriating Funds to Expand the Aircraft Manufacturing Plant <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Director Zeng Requested the Ministry to Quickly Allocate Funds to Add Factory Buildings and Machinery</p>
<p>Maximizing Expansion Can Produce 100 Aircraft Per Year</p>
<p>The Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant has been striving to expand and actively develop since it moved from Mawei to Shanghai in the spring of 1931. Director Zeng Yijing had drafted a plan and submitted it to the Ministry for adoption. It has been approved by the Central Political Council and funds have been allocated for expansion. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e125">Drafting a Plan <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant in Gaochangmiao occupies about 100 acres, bordering the Huangpu River to the east and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to the west, with convenient water and land transportation. Director Zeng Yijing had drafted an expansion plan, initially for 300,000 yuan, with 80,000 yuan for building factory buildings and 220,000 yuan for adding machinery. As for the detailed methods and factory building drawings, they have all been decided. After the expansion, six aircraft can be manufactured each year, and it has been submitted to the Ministry of the Navy for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Approved Appropriation <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>After the expansion plan was submitted to the Ministry, Yang Shuzhuang also submitted it to the Central Political Council, which approved the appropriation of more than 100,000 yuan for expansion. It was submitted to the Military Affairs Committee for review and transferred to the Ministry of Military Affairs for handling. The Ministry of Military Affairs decided to submit it to the Aviation Administration for consideration. After the Aviation Administration reviewed it and attached its opinions, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan, which ordered the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds appropriately. The Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant recently submitted a request to the Ministry to request the Ministry of Finance to quickly allocate funds in order to proceed.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Current Situation <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency recently met with Director Zeng, who said that after the Ministry of Finance allocates funds to Shanghai, he will immediately find ways to expand, first building factory buildings on the open space in front of the gate and adding power machinery. Because most of the original machinery is manual, there are currently 100 workers, all of whom are skilled workers. The engineers are all students who graduated from the United States and naval training. Only one aircraft used on the Ninghai warship is currently being manufactured. As for the current situation, due to financial difficulties, expenses are kept to a minimum. For example, the salary of engineers is no more than 200 yuan per month.</p>
<h3 id="e128">After Expansion <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the business department in this plant this year, it has been dedicated to designing drawings and manufacturing various types of commercial and military aircraft for all sectors. It will also use domestic materials as much as possible to ensure that customers are satisfied. However, since its establishment, no one from all sectors who are enthusiastic about promoting aviation has ordered from the plant. After the initial expansion, the annual output can be increased to six aircraft, and the manufacturing will be faster. It is hoped that all sectors will come to order, the price is low, and the quality is excellent. We welcome the outside world to come to the factory to monitor the work. If the funding is sufficient, given the size of the land, building a factory for manufacturing can produce up to 100 aircraft per year.</p>
<p>Inspection of Factories in the Concessions</p>

<p>The Municipal Government Hopes to Resolve It Soon</p>
<p>Regarding the inspection of factories in the Public Concession, after repeated consultations between Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and Feixindao, Director-General of the Municipal Council, a decision has been made. The Municipal Government immediately submitted a report to the Industry Department of the Executive Yuan for verification. The Municipal Council has scheduled to submit it to the Board of Directors for discussion today (Wednesday). It is heard that there are still slight differences of opinion regarding the number of inspectors. According to investigations by the Municipal Government, the equipment in the factories in the Concession is quite dangerous. It is deeply hoped that the inspection issue can be resolved quickly and smoothly so that inspections can be implemented as soon as possible in order to alleviate the suffering of workers.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Cracks Down on Rubber Factories</p>
<h3 id="e130">The Machinery Industry Association Submits a Protest <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Industry Association Pushes Representatives to Urge Inquiries with the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Machinery Industry Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating, "This submission is for the matter of petitioning. Since the implementation of our country's Factory Law, the Shanghai Public Concession Taxpayers' Association unilaterally amended Article 34 of the appendix to the Yangjingbang Land Regulations. The Association knew that the Municipal Council was deliberately destroying our country's entire labor administration and resisting the right of factory inspection so that it could not be implemented within the concession area. Later, due to repeated opposition from various groups in Shanghai, knowing the excitement of our people, they changed their strategy and sought shortcuts, citing Article 30 of the Yangjingbang Regulations to prevent public danger as an excuse, ordering Yiyuan and other factories to stop work and relocate. Article 30 has been established for a long time, why not implement it in the past but apply it today? Its sinister intentions are known to everyone. If it once indulges its power and plunders our right to inspect factories in the concession, there will be many disadvantages, which are listed as follows: (1) The concession authorities protect foreign merchants' factories from inspection by Chinese officials. (2) Increase the Municipal Council's large amount of licensing revenue. (3) Understand Chinese industrial secrets. (4) Suppress Chinese industry, making it impossible to develop. (5) Destroy China's entire labor administration, making it ununified, and it is also convenient to make excuses for other negotiations. According to the above situation, it concerns national sovereignty. It is appropriate to protest reasonably to protect sovereignty and ensure industry, which is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Industry of the National Government."</p>
<p>The Rubber Products Industry Association of this city held a standing committee meeting at 2 PM yesterday, chaired by Shi Zhishan. The resolutions were: (1) Chairman Shi submitted that the application of the new member, the Da Zhongyang Rubber Factory, to join the association has been pending for a long time and has not yet been investigated. Now, at the 23rd standing committee meeting, the case was submitted for reconsideration, and the standing committee members Shi Zhishan, Shen Mengshi, and Mao Yuting were appointed to investigate the factory in detail. The report showed that there was nothing inappropriate and asked whether it could be approved to join the association. The resolution was that since it has been verified that there is no suspicion, it should be approved to join the association. (2) The National Goods Factory Federation and the Rubber Industry Union of the Third District inquired about the handling of the case of the Municipal Council ordering the relocation of factories. The resolution was to reply separately that the case has not been resolved yet, and the three members Feng Yunchu, Yang Weiyin, and Shen Mengshi will be pushed to the Municipal Government to urge inquiries. The meeting adjourned at 5 PM.</p>

<p>The Municipal Land Bureau issued a notice yesterday, stating: "Notice regarding the city's busy season silver tax for the 22nd year, scheduled to begin on August 1st. Concerning the tax quota for the Zhenru District, previously, due to reports of a poor autumn harvest in the 21st year, a request was made to reduce the land tax to provide relief. The Finance Bureau, together with this bureau, investigated the disaster situation and agreed to a general reduction of 0.05 of the busy season grain tax. This reduction was not implemented in the same year, and it was proposed to offset it against the 22nd year's busy season grain tax. This proposal was submitted to the municipal government and approved. This bureau has complied with the instructions on record. The busy season silver tax for this district in the current year should be reduced by 0.05 according to the approved plan. The remaining districts will continue to collect taxes based on the old amount and price, with detailed information recorded on the tax bills. It is stipulated that all taxes must be paid within two months from the start of the tax collection period, with a deadline of September 30th. Those who fail to pay by the deadline will be subject to an additional 0.2 tax. An additional two months will be allowed, with a deadline of November 30th. Those who still fail to pay by the deadline will be subject to an additional 0.1 tax as a penalty for late payment. This matter has been reported to the municipal government for record-keeping and has been communicated to the relevant departments. A notice is hereby issued to inform the people of this city to pay their taxes at the counters within the specified time limit, obtain receipts, and secure their property. Do not delay. This notice is urgent."</p>

Cai replied that the inability to balance the budget was unavoidable every year and that other remedies must be sought. The reporter further asked whether new public bonds would be issued in the future to seek remedies. Cai replied that it was unlikely at present but did not deny the possibility. Cai finally stated that previous reports that the house tax in the North Sichuan Road area could generate 600,000 yuan per year were inaccurate.</p>

<p>Held at Hongqiao Airport Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Mayor Wu and Kong Xiangxi Both Attended</p>
<p>The Italian Fei Ye De aircraft manufacturing plant, managed by the Italian Yixing Company, is renowned. During his visit to Italy, Finance Minister Song Ziwen ordered multiple C.R.30 fighter planes from the factory. To arouse national interest in aviation and demonstrate the aircraft's power, Yixing Company held a demonstration flight at Hongqiao Airport at 5:30 PM yesterday. Attendees included Mayor Wu, Central Bank President Kong Xiangxi, Aviation Association Standing Committee member Lin Wojiang, Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Public Utilities Bureau Director Xu Peihuang, Public Security Bureau Director Wen Hongen, Yu Qiaqing, Yu Zuoting, Italian Consul-General in Shanghai Le Duli, Italian Embassy Air Force Attaché Lu Di, and the Italian Marine Corps, totaling approximately 500 people. A large contingent of soldiers from the Municipal Security Department provided perimeter security. Mao Heyuan, general manager of Yixing Company in China, warmly greeted the guests. The C.R.30 fighter plane, with a horsepower of 750, was painted silver-gray and could travel 240 miles per hour. It was piloted by Italian Aviation Lieutenant Cos. At 5:30 PM, the plane took off and performed various maneuvers, including banking, stall turns, and inverted and oblique flight, eliciting gasps from the audience. At around 6:00 PM, it landed safely. Mayor Wu and others stepped forward to shake hands and express their admiration. It was reported that the demonstration showed the Italian plane's power was superior to the American Curtiss Hawk fighter plane.</p>

<p>Negotiations Underway Regarding the Tounan Case</p>
<h3 id="e136">Order from the Ministry of Transportation <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The case of the China Merchants Bureau's Tounan vessel being sunk by the Japanese vessel Changchun Maru, resulting in the drowning of over a hundred people, has been submitted to the Ministry of Transportation by the bureau based on the report of shipowner Jiang Changqing for review and instructions. At the same time, a letter was sent to Gao Tingzi, Director of the Navigation Administration Department, stating that all important documents and orders would not be published until formal negotiations have been initiated. Yesterday, the Ministry of Transportation issued an order to Shanghai, stating that the exact number of passengers who died in the sinking of the Tounan and the full extent of the vessel's public and private losses have not been reported in detail. Furthermore, the bureau has not reported on the steps taken in negotiations with the Japanese merchants or the progress of the situation. As this matter involves international negotiations, the bureau is ordered to submit a detailed report immediately to allow for review and handling and to prepare for serious negotiations with the Japanese side. The bureau has completed the preparation of Jiang Changqing's detailed report in Western languages and will submit it to the Ministry of Transportation for review.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Shipowner's Statement <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Shipowner Jiang Changqing recently issued a statement in response to a letter sent by passengers rescued from the Tounan to the shipping ticket office, claiming that the shipowner and crew did not carry out rescue operations after the accident. The statement reads: "The Tounan vessel was split into two sections immediately after being struck by the Changchun Maru. I was trapped under the bridge and, after being pulled out, saw that the front section of the vessel had already sunk. Eight passengers and twenty-nine crew members on board jumped into the Japanese vessel. I was the last person to leave the Tounan. If I had jumped immediately upon impact, I could have jumped to the deck of the Changchun Maru with thirty others. Why would I have been holding onto the hatch? Furthermore, the Tounan sank in only four minutes. If rescue operations could have been carried out, why would Erche Zheng Jingsheng have returned to the cabin and drowned? The radio operator rushed into the cabin to retrieve a life jacket and was trapped inside. If the waves had not destroyed the cabin, he would have also died. At that critical moment, with the ship sinking in an instant, how could rescue operations have been possible? If the ship had not sunk completely in four minutes, wouldn't the fifty-three crew members, all experienced sailors, have preferred to escape rather than be buried in the bellies of fish? Shipowner Jiang also stated that the rumor that the Tounan sank after twelve minutes was completely false."</p>
<h3 id="e138">Tragic State of Banditry in Sichuan <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society recently received a joint report from refugee groups in Bazhong, Tongjiang, and Nanjiang counties in Sichuan Province, stating: "The scourge of the Xu Kuang Red Bandits has spread to Sichuan, and our three counties of Bazhong, Tongjiang, and Nanjiang have suffered greatly. Since last year, we have been invaded repeatedly. The brutality of the massacres, the scale of the destruction, and the completeness of the looting are well-known to officials. Prosperous areas have been transformed into desolate wastelands in an instant. Now, we have fallen into misery again. The people of our three counties are constantly falling under the iron hooves of the Red Bandits, or wandering homeless in the ditches of foreign lands. Neighboring counties have tens of thousands of refugees gathered. The cries of the refugees are endless, and there is no way to survive. We earnestly plead with kind-hearted people to embrace a spirit of compassion and show mercy. We ask you to donate grain, provide porridge, draw water from the West River, or gather quilts to distribute to the refugees in various areas to provide relief and revive the survivors so that the refugees of our three counties can return to their homeland and see the light of day again. We would be eternally grateful. We submit this urgent plea in the hope that you will understand." The society has been involved in Sichuan relief for many years, and the people are grateful. Now, the banditry in Sichuan has begun, and the suffering is extreme. According to reports, the situation is appalling. The refugees are desperately crying for help. Unfortunately, the society has received little funding and is unable to cope. How can we acquire thousands of rooms and millions of bushels of porridge to save these surviving refugees who are awaiting death? Compatriots with compassion, will you rush to their aid?</p>

<p>The water levels in various sections of the Yangtze River have been declining daily, and it is hoped that the flood season can be passed safely. However, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, which is responsible for the dike work in Hubei Province, is still actively carrying out flood control work. The Engineering Department of the National Economic Council in this city received a report from the Jianghan Bureau yesterday stating that a light railway was used to transport soil to repair the dangerous section of the Qikou Dike in Huangmei County. A sub-dike has been built and internal supports have been added to the seepage area of the Shangchewan Dike in Jianli. Wave protection work has been carried out on the Dayue Dike, and board piles have been driven and internal supports have been added to the leaking sections. Stone has been thrown on the outer slope of the Zhoujiahe River Dike, and earth supports have been built on the inner slope. Sub-dikes have been built at Zhusangong and Jiangjianaodeng to prevent seepage. The Xiang River area has also been secured after emergency protection measures were taken. The Engineering Department also received a telegram from the Henan Provincial Works Bureau stating that the Yellow River has swelled rapidly, the third dam of the Luo River has been washed away, and the water level has suddenly risen by four to six feet, posing a serious danger. Emergency repairs are currently underway. The rise and fall of water levels along the river are attached below:</p>

<h3 id="e147">Police Interference with Clothing Store Hawking <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Taxpayers Association Seeks Justice for the Industry</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of clothing store hawking, we have received your replies of July 8th and 15th, which have been forwarded to the Shanghai Clothing Industry Association. We have received a letter from the association, acknowledging receipt of your letter of July 5th and awaiting the Public Works Department to correct the actions of the police hired with taxpayers' money. However, we have also received a joint letter from Hongyu, Tiansheng, Qiantai, Hongtaixiang, Guchang, Shuntai, Fuyuan, Fulai, Xiekang, Hengxing, Yuanshun, and other clothing stores, stating: 'We have received and reviewed your previous letter to the association and understand that it has been forwarded to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Taxpayers Association for forwarding to the Public Works Department. Our fellow merchants on this road have been repeatedly harassed by the Huishan Police Station. Since our previous letter to the association, we have been prevented from hawking three times and have been forced to pay fines in court twice. If this continues, our shops will be unable to withstand the disturbance. Not only is our business disrupted, but we fear that our industry's future livelihood will be interrupted. At 4:00 PM on the 8th, Police Officer No. 29 from the police station came to each house to prevent us from hawking, recording our door numbers. This happened during a time when customers were plentiful. The police suddenly dispersed the customers and ordered us to turn over our clothes. Our fellow merchants did not dare to resist and had to let them do as they pleased. Clothing stores operating in the concession are taxpayers. Why are we not protected but instead harassed? We have no choice but to request that your association uphold justice, quickly provide assistance, and engage in serious negotiations with the police station. We also earnestly request that you forward our letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Taxpayers Association to provide assistance in maintaining our business and alleviating our business difficulties. We have communicated this matter accordingly and request that you investigate and assist. Thank you.' We understand that your association sent a letter to the Public Works Department before July 5th. The department should uphold its repeated declarations to respect the wishes of the citizens and, based on the value of taxpayers' money being used to purchase peace, immediately correct the actions of the hired police. However, at 4:00 PM on July 8th, Police Officer No. 29 still went to each house to prevent hawking and ordered them to turn over their clothes, continuing to engage in destructive business practices. This not only failed to implement the declaration to respect the wishes of the citizens but also violated the principle of taxpayers' money being used to purchase peace and disregarded your association's letter. Therefore, we are writing again to request that you quickly negotiate with the Public Works Department. Otherwise, our association will send another letter to your association, convening a representative assembly of Chinese taxpayers to discuss the issue of taxation in the future. We have informed you of the reasons for this. Please reply as soon as possible. We understand that maintaining traffic is important. However, since the Hongkou area was allowed to be used as a military base by the Japanese army last year, commerce has declined. The clothing stores in the area are attempting to improve their business by adopting advertising methods, which is commendable. If it is believed that hawking truly obstructs traffic, it may be better to first consult with the industry association through this association to find a mutually agreeable solution. Imposing penalties hastily is more likely to create misunderstandings. The association's plan to request this association to convene a representative assembly to discuss future taxation issues has its reasons. We have informed you of the reasons for this. Accordingly, we request that your association absolutely refrain from interfering with clothing store hawking as much as possible, provided that it does not impede traffic."</p>

<p>Lao Gongmao Bank Announces 10% Rent Increase</p>
<p>City Federation and Others Petition Party and Government to Stop It</p>
<p>Most of the shops and residences on North Fujian Road are properties managed by the rental department of the Lao Gongmao Bank. Recently, the bank suddenly announced a uniform rent increase of 10%. The tenants opposed this increase, citing the poor market conditions and their inability to afford it. They requested assistance from the 37th Branch of the First Special District City Federation and the Road Merchants Association. Lao Gongmao then sent a letter to the two associations, proposing to send representatives to discuss the rent increase. The two associations sent five people, including Sun Wenyi, to negotiate. The two sides initially agreed to temporarily increase the rent by 5%. However, Lao Gongmao suddenly sent a letter denying the previous agreement. Therefore, the two associations held a joint meeting and decided to firmly oppose the rent increase and insist on their opposition. It is said that they will petition the party and government organs to issue a strict order to stop it.</p>

<p>200 Bottles of Newly Invented Emergency Shasha Dan</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society has recently invented and prepared an eye corner Emergency Shasha Dan to treat Susha disease, which is very effective. When encountering an emergency Susha, apply this medicine to the four corners of the eyes. After application, tears will flow, and the eyes will feel very painful. The limbs will become numb and cold. The medicine will then directly reach the dantian, and the symptoms will be relieved. If there is no pain in the eyes after application, then it is not Susha disease. However, it must not be ingested. One bottle of this Dan can treat three or four people. Apply it two or three times every two minutes until the patient's limbs are no longer numb or cold and the body feels comfortable. Therefore, the society donated 200 bottles of this medicine to the Shanghai Charity Organizations Relief Northeast Refugee United Association yesterday, requesting them to be forwarded to the two resident directors of various charity organizations, Dong Qu Yingguang and Feng Yangshan, for use in relieving the sick and poor in the disaster area. It is said that the association will send the medicine to the post office for distribution.</p>

<p>丨A Hooligan Prank丨</p>
<p>Lawyer Xu Shihao went to the Second Special District Court at 9:00 AM yesterday to represent Shi De in the case against Wang Zhenchuan and others for trademark infringement. After the court session, Xu left the court at 10:30 AM, carrying a briefcase. As he stepped out of the gate and was about to open the car door, a tall man with a Northern accent, wearing a xiangyunsha shirt and trousers, was standing outside the court. When he saw Xu leaving the court and opening the car door, the man went up to greet him. Xu nodded in response. Unexpectedly, the man took advantage of Xu's leaning over to get into the car and dumped half a watermelon rind full of feces on Xu's head, completely covering Xu's straw hat, white silk long gown, and the car door and interior with feces. The stench was unbearable. The man stood still and did not leave. Two Westerners went up to him, grabbed him, and sent him to the police station. Upon arriving at the police station, the police chief questioned the man, who only gave his name as Zhang Debiao, 30 years old, from Tianjin. When asked why he threw filth at people and who instructed him to do so, Zhang remained silent. The police chief ordered him to be detained pending investigation and sent to court for trial. In the afternoon, Xu reported the incident to the police station and requested a thorough investigation into the instigator and the arrest and interrogation of the culprit.</p>

<p>Zhang Wenqing, a woman from Huzhou, instigated Chen Wencai and others to kill her stepmother, Zhang Su, at her residence on Route Carde in western Shanghai two years ago. The police station filed charges. As a result of the initial trial, Zhang Wenqing, Chen Hengcai, Gao Jintang, and Yao Yonggui were all sentenced to death. Zhang and others were dissatisfied and filed an appeal. At the conclusion of the second trial, Chen Hengcai was still sentenced to death, but the sentences of the other three defendants were reduced by one degree and each was sentenced to life imprisonment. However, the prosecutor and the police station who filed the charges in the second trial felt that the sentences were too lenient and appealed to the Supreme Court in the third trial. After reviewing the case files, the court overturned the second trial's judgment and sent it back to the Higher Second Branch Court for retrial. The court has been convened multiple times recently. Zhang and the other two male and female defendants were all brought before the court, and witnesses were summoned for questioning. Yesterday morning, Judge Yu, along with judges Zhao and Jiang, took the stand to announce the verdict. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu and the defendant's defense lawyer both appeared in court. Judge Yu then announced the judgment, stating that Zhang Wenqing was guilty of instigating and plotting murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Chen Hengcai and Gao Jintang's appeals were rejected. Yao Yonggui's portion was not accepted. After the judgment, the police sent the three defendants back to the men's and women's prisons for imprisonment.</p>

<p>Ying Ye, a woman from Ningbo, 49 years old, whose husband passed away several years ago, has a son named Gen Cai, nearly twenty years old, a carpenter. The mother and son lived at No. 119 Yongji Lane, Dongxi Huade Road. The day before yesterday afternoon, Gen Cai asked his mother for one yuan in pocket money. His mother told him to take it himself from the box where she kept the money. Later, Ying discovered that three yuan was missing from the box and suspected that her son had taken it. She questioned Gen Cai, who firmly denied it, leading to an argument. Afterwards, Ying became resentful and despondent, and secretly swallowed opium in a suicide attempt. Her son discovered her and found that she was barely breathing. He immediately sent her to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but to no avail. She soon died. The hospital reported the incident to the Huishan Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate. They then transported the body to the Feilun Road autopsy center. Yesterday morning, they reported the matter to the First Special District District Court, which dispatched a prosecutor to the center to examine the body. The prosecutor interrogated Ying Gen Cai, who recounted the events. The prosecutor then declared that the deceased, Ying Ye, a female, had died from opium poisoning. Her son, Ying Gen Cai, signed a statement to take the body back for burial.</p>

<p>Gu Gendi's Letter Reporting Her Experience of Being Driven to Learn Opera</p>
<p>Liao Zhuanji Seeks Assistance from the China Relief Association</p>
<p>Gu Gendi, the twenty-year-old wife of Liao Zhuanji, a tin worker residing at No. 2, Huikang Lane, Caiyang Lane, outside Xiaonanmen in the Nanshi district, was quite beautiful. Three years ago, an old woman from a barber shop in the same neighborhood falsely claimed that she could learn opera and lured her to sell her services as a prostitute at the Xinchun Courtyard of Lao Si in Xiacun Street, Zhangzhou, Fujian Province, for a price of four hundred yuan. Since losing his wife, Liao has searched for her everywhere, but there has been no news. On June 9th of this year, he suddenly received a letter from Gu, which stated, "To my husband, Zhuanji, with deepest regards: Due to a moment of foolishness, I was deceived by an old woman who brought me to Zhangzhou, initially saying that I would learn to sing opera. Little did I know that I would be sold into the brothel world. At that time, I was helpless and had no relatives. I had no choice but to make the best of a bad situation. As of today, I am in debt for about four hundred yuan. A momentary lapse has now left me ill, and the suffering in my illness is beyond words. I only hope that my husband will remember our love as husband and wife and find a way to get me out of this fiery pit. I would be forever grateful. I am writing to apologize and beg that you reply as soon as you receive this letter. Wishing you peace. Your wife, Gu Gendi." Upon receiving the letter, Liao was both surprised and overjoyed. However, the travel expenses were too high, so he hesitated. In the past few days, he has received several urgent letters describing her pitiful situation, which chills him to the bone. Liao has been trying to raise travel funds for days, planning to go there, but few have responded, and he seems dazed. Some have suggested that Liao write a letter to the China Relief Association on Longmen Road to request assistance. After receiving the letter, Chen Angui, the director of the relief section of the association, questioned Liao in detail about everything. Because the matter was in Zhangzhou, it was inconvenient to take sole responsibility. He submitted it to a regular meeting of the association, which immediately decided to send someone to Zhangzhou to investigate in order to negotiate and reunite Liao with his wife.</p>

The log fell and crushed Zhang Jinlin's head, causing his brains to splatter, and he died instantly. Someone witnessed the incident and called the police, who sent him to Tongren Hospital by car before transferring him to the morgue for examination.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Examination Process of Middle Schools in the City <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Planning to Award Scholarships to Students with Excellent Grades</p>
<p>The Exam Leakage Case Has Been Clarified, 31 Graduates from Jianguo</p>
<p>This year's joint graduation examination for primary and secondary schools in this city, the preliminary examination, follow-up examination, and supplementary examination have all ended successively. The results of the joint examination have also been announced. However, this joint examination is the first one held in this city, and the process of handling it is deeply concerned by educators. Yesterday, the reporter of the Shanghai News Agency visited Mr. Jiang Shixun, the executive member of the high school group of the examination committee, and learned about the process of this year's joint graduation examination for middle schools as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Executive Committee Member Jiang Talks <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>This city's joint graduation examination for middle schools, after the dispute over the leakage of examination questions occurred, the follow-up examination and supplementary examination were held on the 13th, 14th, and 15th of this month and have been completed. The grading method follows the Ministry's order, with 40 points as the passing grade. This lenient approach is not due to the disturbances, but because it is the first time that a joint examination is held, it cannot be too harsh. The school should be responsible for the good or bad performance of the students, not just the students themselves. In total, this middle school,</p>
<h3 id="e181">Examination Results <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Approximately 80% of the students in each subject passed and are allowed to graduate. Approximately 10% of the students failed in three or more subjects or were absent and are held back. The remaining 10% or so of the students failed in one or two subjects or were absent and should take supplementary lessons. Among the students who are held back or take supplementary lessons, the majority are absent. Only a small number of students actually failed. There are still some students who, either under the suggestion of the school or under the pressure of a few students, left the school and could not participate in this follow-up examination, totaling more than 180 people. These students may have already taken eight or six subjects, and there is still one or three subjects that have not been taken. They have been approved by the Ministry,</p>
<h3 id="e182">Temporary Enrollment <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Starting from today, they can go to the Education Bureau to collect certificates of passing subjects taken in order to apply for schools. The certificate states that they still need to take supplementary examinations for the subjects not taken. The Education Bureau will stipulate the supplementary examination methods and dates, which will generally be before the start of school. If they still do not participate in this supplementary examination or fail the supplementary examination, their enrollment qualification will be revoked. The Education Bureau has already stipulated the calculation method for the overall results of this joint examination. Based on the school's grades, the ranking of the school and the ranking of the students will be revealed. For schools with poor performance, improvements will be made. Schools with excellent performance will be rewarded. The students with the best grades may</p>

<p>The specific methods still need to be submitted to the Bureau Affairs Meeting for approval before a decision can be made. The Education Bureau will compile a detailed report and explanation of all the detailed processes and grades of the joint examination, on the one hand to let the schools know the actual situation, and on the other hand to serve as a reference for the next joint examination. As for the</p>

<p>Case, the Bureau has sent 1,000 pieces of evidence to the Shanghai District Court. After the court's investigation, the prosecution has now been completed. The defendants are Zhang Jieliang, a proofreader from the Nanjing Printing Company, Xie Zhen from the Central Daily News, and Xie Ying, a student from Jianguo. As for the students from Jianguo Middle School who participated in the joint examination, except for Xie Ying, whose qualification was revoked, the rest have been announced, totaling 31 passing students, it is said.</p>

<p>University Education Association Submitted a Request</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Ministry of Education Approved Enrollment for the Law School <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The Foundation of Private Schools Lies in Students</p>
<p>The Method of Reorganizing Education Lies in Daily Practice</p>
<p>Please Consider the Hardships of Starting a Business and Handle it Flexibly</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Faculty Association yesterday sent a telegram to the Nanjing Ministry of Education stating: Minister Wang, Nanjing Ministry of Education: We have recently received a statement from members of our association, stating that your Ministry issued an order on the 20th of this month to stop the Shanghai Law School and other schools from enrolling new students and transfer students, giving them a final opportunity to improve. This shows that your Ministry has the intention of actively encouraging improvement while passively cracking down. However, these schools have been established for many years, with painstaking efforts and arduous management, and have now gradually established a solid foundation and a basic scale. In the future, under the strict supervision and guidance of your Ministry, they can certainly be reorganized and innovated, in line with the expectations of your Ministry. We believe that the foundation of private schools lies in students, and the method of reorganization lies in daily practice. Now that enrollment is stopped, the classes will be interrupted, and the economic sources will be cut off. Maintaining the status quo is already difficult, and reorganizing the school affairs is even more difficult. There is fundamentally no opportunity for improvement, which is not the original intention of your Ministry to protect education. Therefore, we specially send a telegram to earnestly request your consideration of the schools' enthusiasm for running schools and the hardships of starting a business. We earnestly hope that you will handle it flexibly and allow them to continue enrollment, which would be fortunate for education. Respectfully submitted, Shanghai University Faculty Association.</p>

<p>Hiring Directors of Various Departments</p>
<p>Reducing the Cost of the Congress</p>
<p>Nian Jiu Opened the Second Congress</p>
<p>(Special News from Nanjing) The budget案 for the National Games to be held this year on the Double Tenth Festival has been reduced to 50,000 yuan by the Central Political Conference. The Preparatory Committee for the National Games is actively preparing. In addition to the general rules of the Congress, which have been revised and promulgated by the Ministry of Education, the remaining preparatory matters coincided with the opening of the Ministry of Education's summer sports training class, and the committee members were busy with their duties, so they had to temporarily postpone the preparatory matters for the National Games. Now the summer sports class has started, and the registration of students ended on the 18th, with a total of 314 people. All matters can be carried out in order, and the date of the National Games is approaching. Preparatory affairs are numerous and should be prepared as soon as possible to avoid the urgency of time. Therefore, the appointment letters of the directors of various departments were issued yesterday, including the Director of the Referee Committee Wang Zhengting, the Director of the Judging Committee Zhang Boling, the Secretary-General Zhang Xinfu, the Deputy Secretary-General Wu Yunrui, the Director of the Document Section Peng Baichuan, the Director of the General Affairs Section Lei Zhen, the Director of the Accounting Section Zheng Yanghe, the Director of the Propaganda Section Guo Lianfeng, the Director of the Transportation Section Wu Zhuozhi, the Director of the Police Section Ma Xiang, the Director of the Venue Equipment Section Jin Zhaojun, the Director of the Registration and Allocation Section Wu Bangwei, the Director of the Record Section Zhang Zhongfan, the Director of the Referee Section Ma Yuehan, the Director of the Awards Section Xu Yanzhi, the Director of the Health Section Liu Ruiheng, the Director of the National Arts Section Xu Yusheng, and the Director of the Reception Section Huang Renlin. In addition, the free round-trip train and ship tickets for athletes and referees have been approved by the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Transportation, and the Central Sports Field will be received on August 1st in accordance with the joint agreement between the Ministry of Education and the Mausoleum Management Committee. The Preparatory Committee will move to the field to work on the same day. On the 18th, the committee suddenly received resignation letters from Jin Zhaojun and Wu Bangwei, and returned the appointment letters for the venue section and the registration section. It is heard that the Standing Committee will discuss it at the meeting on the 20th.</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee reduced the cost of the conference to 50,000 yuan due to the Central Political Conference. This cost is very insufficient. Yesterday, I specially sent a letter to the directors of the various departments, asking them to reduce the minimum cost required again, and send it to the meeting together with the planning book of each department before the 25th of this month, so that it can be submitted for discussion at the second plenary session of the Preparatory Committee on the 29th of this month. According to the opinions of most of the preparatory committees, the cost of 50,000 yuan, no matter how frugal, will definitely be insufficient. Since the government is sincerely holding this meeting, it must also know the actual difficulties. Therefore, after the second meeting of the preparatory committee, it will immediately submit a request to the central government to increase the budget. At a minimum, it must be issued in full in accordance with the previous decision of the Executive Yuan of more than 90,000 yuan before it can be started. Otherwise, it will be difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice.</p>

On the 11th, they took the original ship to the Philippines, and arrived in Manila at 8:00 AM on the 13th. The Chinese Consulate in the Philippines sent personnel in advance to handle the landing procedures. Lin Zhuguang and other well-known figures in the city personally went to the ship to meet them. There were also many Chinese and Western newspaper reporters to inquire about the team's news and to take photos. The wharf was very lively for a while. After the team landed, the Chinese YMCA was responsible for entertaining everything. They are now staying at the YMCA dormitory, and the YMCA has appointed Cai Yixian to contact the competition matters. In addition, the Philippines Charity Association heard that the Nanyang Business Basketball Team had arrived in the Philippines, and sent a letter to the mayor of Manila, Philippines, asking the Nanyang Business Team to compete with the Philippine teams to raise funds. The mayor ordered Du Lishi, the director of the city's sports field, to handle the matter. Therefore, Du Lishi also went to the wharf to meet the ship, and contacted Wu Xinglian, the principal of the Youth Association and Nanyang Business School, and has obtained the permission of the Nanyang Business Team to raise funds for the city's charity association.

<h3 id="e202">Jinan Planning to Build a Swimming Pool <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Sports Field Expanded to Supplement Basketball Field</p>
<p>丨The Excitement of Shandong Sports Circle After the North Games丨</p>
<p>(Correspondence from Jinan) In this North China Games, the Shandong male high school and male middle school players were almost completely wiped out. Fortunately, the efforts of the female heroes and the struggle of the national martial arts masters won the women's track and field championship and the wrestling championship, which was enough to make people laugh. However, with only three points difference, it is said that it is dangerous to live in Qingdao. The tired swimming of the Xuanping team has just returned in the past few days. This conference is a great stimulus for the entire province. The Qilu athletes vowed to work hard to hone their skills and wait for the future. Recently, the sports field has been expanding the football and basketball fields, building a gymnasium, to prepare for the North China Football and Basketball Tournament during the winter vacation. The Education Department is also planning to build a swimming pool to train the navy. The recent preparations are described below.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Swimming Pool <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>This province has no such equipment for swimming, and there is no way to practice it. Therefore, in the past North China Games, only track and field and ball games were participated in, and swimming was just watching from the sidelines. The situation is similar to today's China, with an army but no navy. Last year, Jinan citizens requested the government to build a swimming pool, and the location was planned on the side of Yuequan Spring in Nanguan, but it was a flash in the pan and was shelved again. Recently, He Siyuan of the Education Department led the athletes to the Qingdao Games. Because there are swimming teams in many provinces and cities, the Shandong team, which lives by the sea, was absent, which is a great regret. After returning to Jinan, a swimming pool is now being planned. The location is planned to be at the Black Tiger Spring under the southeast corner of the Nanguan City. Because Jinan is known as the two famous springs, the water source is strong, and it can be set up everywhere. Once the plan is determined, construction can be started, and it is expected to be realized in August. Black Tiger Spring is a famous scenic spot in Jinan. The blue water is clear and transparent. There is a stone tiger head carved beside the spring. The spring water gurgles and spurts out of the tiger's mouth, splashing beads and jade, like the sound of waves on the beach. If a swimming pool is built there, it will complement the famous spring and be a natural scenic spot.</p>

<p>The next North China Football and Basketball Tournament has now been confirmed to be held in Jinan during the winter vacation. Although the track and field field of the Provincial Sports Field has a rough scale, the ball field is still mostly simple. After the Qingdao North China Games, expansion is now being planned to prepare a place for the teams from the ten provinces and cities in North China to use their weapons. In addition to the original football field temporarily borrowing the track and field field, new foundations purchased in the east of the field are being sorted out. Five new basketball fields have been set up in the new field, and one football field is being built. It should be enough to use during the North China Football and Basketball Tournament. As for the old field, six tennis courts and four volleyball courts are also being renovated at this moment. Expanding the sports field, Zu Shangshu Mei told the reporter that the sports field plans to build a gymnasium (gym), the address is planned to be west of the current office, the old earth ditch is filled and built, and the scale is slightly imitated from the Tsinghua University gymnasium. There is a basketball court and office in the room, and it is still in the planning stage. Only after the decision is made can preparations begin. (20th)</p>

<h3 id="e205">Recent Problems in the Lives of Japanese Elementary School Teachers (by Yuan Wenzhang) <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>1.  The Arrears in Salary for Japanese Elementary School Teachers</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the agricultural panic in Japan, the rural economy has practically entered a state of bankruptcy. The impoverishment of farmers has affected the living conditions of elementary school teachers. In some rural areas, teachers have even been asked to personally visit farmers to collect overdue taxes in order to pay the teachers' back wages. This situation shows that local governments in Japan are truly helpless in dealing with economic problems. According to a report by the Japan Imperial Teachers Association in April of last year, there were salary arrears in one prefecture and twenty-four counties (out of three prefectures and forty-three counties nationwide in Japan), totaling 381 schools. The situation was particularly severe in Kumamoto, Nagasaki, and Nagano prefectures. Today, although the problem of salary arrears has spread throughout the country, what was once considered "more severe" in places like Kumamoto is no longer uncommon. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>A certain teachers' association in Niigata sent a report to all teachers in the county, stating: "When observing the real situation in rural areas and seeking to understand the dynamics of the educational community, everything feels stagnant and corrupt. The deepening of the agricultural panic has rapidly led to insecurity in the lives of six thousand rural teachers in our county. Due to the expansion of deferred tax payments, the salary arrears of teachers have reached more than thirty schools. Rural areas have also implemented forced donations and reduced bonuses, etc. Over one hundred and three schools in Akita Prefecture have salary arrears, amounting to over 100,000 yuan. Teachers have truly reached the lowest stratum of poverty..."</p>
<p>Comparable to the above report is a report from the county education affairs department on the situation at the end of last year. According to this report, twenty-four townships and towns had salary arrears, amounting to 27,000 yuan, with the village of Suizu in Sado being the most severe, having arrears dating back to April of the year before, continuing until the end of last year.</p>
<p>In Nagano Prefecture, the number of schools with salary arrears was twenty-eight in April of last year, seventy-two in May, and reached one hundred and eighty-six in June. Here is a statistical summary of the salary arrears situation in the county (June 1932):</p>
<p>Arrears</p>
<p>Number of schools: 425, 186</p>
<p>Number of teachers: 7,512, 2,716</p>
<p>Monthly salary amount: 418,000 yuan, 119,000 yuan</p>
<p>28.54%</p>
<p>In the northern part of Iwate Prefecture, there is not a single place that can pay full salaries. Most arrears are around three months. The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun's Iwate edition also reported that "When the county authorities sent personnel to various townships and towns to urge payment, the village chiefs, assistant officers, and accountants all avoided meeting them, so the authorities had no choice but to ignore the situation." In Miyagi Prefecture, salary arrears affected fifty-five townships and towns.</p>
<p>In other areas, although salaries are paid, various exploitative methods such as forced donations are used, which effectively amount to salary reductions. According to the recent "Survey of Rural Depression" by the Imperial Agricultural Association, many places still implement forced donations, ranging from one to six tenths of the salary.</p>
<p>2.  The Compensation of Japanese Elementary School Teachers</p>
<p>The salaries of Japanese elementary school teachers were not originally high enough to warrant reductions. Consequently, everyone finds it impossible to make a living. The total number of elementary school teachers nationwide, including regular teachers in primary and higher grades, specialist teachers, associate teachers, and substitute teachers, is 234,700 (surveyed in March 1931). The average income of each teacher is 70 yuan, 2 jiao, 4 fen for male regular teachers in ordinary courses, and 49 yuan, 7 jiao, 4 fen for female teachers. When comparing the salary ratios of men and women in urban and rural areas, the ratio is 55% in urban areas and 45% in rural areas.</p>
<p>The above are average amounts. Now, let's talk about the highest and lowest. The highest-paid male regular teachers in core subjects earn 240 yuan, and female teachers earn 120 yuan. Male regular teachers in primary courses earn 130 yuan, and female teachers earn 100 yuan. The lowest-paid male teachers in core subjects earn 10 yuan, and female teachers earn 12 yuan. Male teachers in primary courses earn 15 yuan, and female teachers earn 8 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Summer Vacation <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The scorching sun travels across the sky, green shade encircles the earth. During the hot summer, all major, middle, and elementary schools are on summer vacation.</p>
<p>The education authorities stipulate 42 days for elementary school summer vacation, 56 days for middle school, and more than two months for college. The heat is the same, but the length of vacation differs depending on whether the student is in elementary, middle, or college. Person A says: Because college students are most afraid of the heat, middle school students are next, and elementary school students are less so, therefore college vacation is the longest, middle and elementary schools are next. Person B says: Logically, college students are strong, and more heat resistant, vacation should be the shortest; elementary school students have not yet fully developed, they are very fragile, they can least endure the heat, and should get the most days off. Middle school students remain in between. Person C says: The older the student, the more they should read dead books, they should go to society to read live books, so the vacation should be the longest. Person D says: There should be no summer vacation at all, if you say you cannot read books because of the heat, then why do farmers not stop cultivating, workers not enter factories, merchants close their shops, soldiers not fight, or rickshaw pullers not pull cars because of the heat? Also, a vacation is not hot from the first day to the last, and a day is not hot from morning to night, on days that are not hot, cool mornings, you can read books, summer schools after summer vacation burst forth like bamboo shoots after rain, is that not clear proof that you can read books in hot weather? Person E says: There should be a summer vacation, but before the vacation begins, the school should assign them vacation homework, students in the countryside should be asked to do this, students in workers' districts should be asked to do that, students in the city should be asked to do this, one by one they take the homework outline and work according to the outline, and when school starts, each turns in the homework report, and the strengths and weaknesses are critiqued, this is an excellent grade, important learning. Today's schools, futilely give summer vacation, and never give them live books to read, wasting time, it is a pity! It would be better to not have vacation and give them more dead books to read.</p>
<p>The words of Person A, B, C, D, and E, who is right and who is wrong, please let the education world think.</p>

<p>It's summer again. | These words slipped lightly from people's mouths.</p>
<p>On the skyscrapers, hangs a scorching sun, like a brazier.</p>
<p>The swimming pool is filled with a large amount of blue Shar, turning the water into a turquoise color. Water battles, hand-to-hand combat, laughter, scolding, chasing, are publicly exhibited, showing the beauty of lines, the beauty of health; a great new contribution of the summer of 1933 |</p>
<p>The beggars do not have the blessing of entering the swimming pool, and can only wash in the Suzhou River, but, the police came, and they ran away in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>The banners of summer sales flutter scrapingly, the signs of cold drinks hang high, timely ornaments of the street ah!</p>
<p>Under the big yellow umbrella. Frozen sour plum soup has also come on the market, five coppers for a cup, an economical cold drink; Zheng Fuzhai's is good. | A friend said to another friend.</p>
<p>Under the pink cool umbrella, a soft waist trembles, like a flower snake.</p>
<p>In the big mansion, they are arguing about where to go for summer vacation: the third concubine wants to go to Lushan, the fifth concubine wants to go to Moganshan, the young master is clamoring to go to Sullivan, but the eldest young master wants to go to the Wusong seaside for a spin first.</p>
<p>In the evening, the benches in the park are full of people, buttocks touching buttocks; the cars on Jungong Road fly by in succession, the car's rear end stirs up dust, making people unable to breathe.</p>
<p>The sea is roaring, the street trees are swaying, the people enjoying the cool breeze are laughing!</p>
<p>It's summer again. | Life slipped lightly from people's mouths.</p>
<p>The scorching sun, drunk on whiskey, just returned from the city, face red, like a persimmon, stepping to the rhythm of a waltz, tilted and crooked, falling behind the dark mountain.</p>
<p>Under the bean trellis and melon racks, the farmers are shirtless, drinking white liquor, eating peanuts, content and at ease.</p>
<p>The fields send the singing of shepherds, the calls of cuckoos, the chirping of cicadas, the croaking of frogs. The children, naked, jump into the creek to take a clean bath and scoop up a bowl of snails and mussels, catch a few big fish, and go home to supplement dinner, truly fun.</p>
<p>The young village girl, steals a peek, blushes with shame, and quickly hides in the house.</p>
<p>The peaches are ripe, wonderfully red, climb up the tree to pick and eat, one, two, three</p>
<p>Smoke rises from the thatched roof, curling, like a black dragon, smearing the splendid rosy clouds black.</p>
<p>The summer in the city is noisy, filled with the stench of sweat and flesh!</p>
<p>The summer in the countryside is quiet, depicting a beautiful mood!</p>
<h3 id="e208">Fan <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The fan fans a cool breeze, fans in summer, not winter. Someone asked to borrow it from me, wait until the middle of August.</p>
<p>These four lines of vulgar poetry, in elementary school students, shop clerks, and friends who know a few characters, are often seen on the fans they hold. Although the words are vulgar, the meaning is very practical. From the perspective of new literary scholars, it can be included in the book of folk literature. As for the refusal to lend the fan, the reason is very obvious. You are hot and I am hot; you want to fan yourself and I want to fan myself. Who would sacrifice their own happiness for the benefit of others? You invade other people's rights for your own happiness, which is not a good thing. So, not lending the fan, in terms of emotion and reason, makes sense. Moreover, "the fan follows the person." As you wave it and walk, you may forget to return it to the owner and fan it all the way to your home.</p>
<p>People with knowledge, after all, have more tricks. On the snow-white fan surface, they invite calligraphers and painters to brush a few strokes. In fact, it may not be cooler to fan with it. And because they cherish the calligraphy and painting on the fan surface, they are unwilling to fan it vigorously. This kind of fan, rather than saying it is a cooling item, it is more accurate to say it is an ornament.</p>
<p>Zhuge Liang on the stage always holds a feather fan, regardless of the cold winter or hot summer. This fan seems to be like the walking stick held by modern people, decorating the scene, and showing off the prestige. The oilcloth fan used by friends in the underworld is painted with Yama sitting high; a judge standing by; and little ghosts crowding on both sides. At first, I thought it was to encourage good and punish evil. Later, I realized that the painting contained a song, which is the rules for underworld heroes to join the gang. Although there is no restriction on the use of fans, there is a certain distinction in secret. Men mostly use bamboo-bone folding fans; women use goose feather fans and round fans; occasionally, they use small folding fans, which are only three or four inches long, so how can they fan out a breeze. Friends in the underworld and laborers like to use oilcloth fans; villagers like to use palm-leaf fans. I think palm-leaf fans have the largest breeze; the price is also the cheapest; and they are the most durable. Friends of practical philosophy can advocate the use of palm-leaf fans.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Elegy for Xilin <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>I received the obituary of Cen Xilin in June. Public opinion on the Duke has settled, and the national history will have biographies and eulogies. I am merely writing a private elegy. I accompanied the Duke when he served as the Minister of the Court of Judicature during the Guangxu Jiawu year of the Qing Dynasty. That year, war was declared with Japan. The Duke submitted a memorial requesting the gathering of the former troops of the late Duke Xiangqin to go out and kill the enemy. His loyalty, bravery, and indignation were expressed in the words "punishing the Japanese" and "conquering the dwarves," surpassing even today's anti-Japanese rhetoric. The imperial edict was issued to the Imperial Commissioner Liu Kunyi for dispatch. The Duke was displeased, and I also resigned. Six years later, during the Gengzi Boxer Rebellion, the Duke served the King in Xi'an, was appointed Governor of Shaanxi, and then transferred to Governor of Shanxi. I entered the Duke's staff for the second time. In Renyin, he was transferred to Governor of Guangdong, but he did not take office and was promoted to Governor-General of Sichuan. There were bandit disturbances in Sichuan, and he was ordered to proceed with all speed. He left Taiyuan on the 15th of July and arrived in Chengdu on the 24th of August. The imperial court praised his speed, and the French minister especially admired him. I was one of those who followed the Duke with all speed. I was thirty years old at the time, and the Duke was about forty years old. The accompanying civil and military officials were all young people, with no one over fifty years old. At that time, people said that the staff of the commander-in-chief were all children. The journey followed the Hedong Road, crossed the Yellow River at Lingfeng Ferry, entered Tongguan, passed Xi'an, crossed the Wei River, took the road through Fengxiang, and entered Sichuan along the Jialing River from Guangyuan and Zhaohua. I gained the richest poetry from this expedition. Just as the Duke was taking office, a telegram arrived informing him that his wife had passed away in Hubei, and his son, De Gu, had also died. To this day, I still don't know why this event has remained so deeply etched in my mind. The following year, I was recommended by Teacher Dai Wencheng for a special examination and entered the capital. I resigned for the second time. After that, I met him once in the old capital, and again in Shanghai. During the eighth or ninth year of the Republic of China, I encountered him in Shanghai. The conversation was filled with even more feelings of vicissitudes than before. The decline of the country and the demise of people, alas! The students and former officials will surely hold a memorial meeting. Among those whom the Duke recruited, I should be the first, and also the least successful. Sighing for the departed, I also reflect on myself. A hundred thoughts converge, and I am lost in confusion. Afflicted by illness, I am unable to go and mourn. I hastily write this elegy, the words of which are:</p>
<p>The nation's troubles are repeated, finally breaking away from the world like an old woman, closing her eyes and no longer seeing. Old journeys are vivid, remembering the scattered guests of those times, my tears are hard to hold back.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Four Company Commanders of the Northeast <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: The Poor and Humble Join the Army, the Sick Fall Behind</p>
<p>Sacrifice is Sweet to Resign, Soldiers are Sentimental</p>
<p>But my nerves were excited, but they didn't listen to people's commands. Outside the window, the sound of wind passing through the sky, and the sound of dead branches being broken by the cold wind and hitting the roof tiles. The snoring in the soldiers' rooms came in waves, reaching my ears. Since my ears were not deaf, and I was awake, there was no way I couldn't hear the sound. Since I heard every sound, I naturally couldn't sleep. I don't know when, I used some magic tricks to make myself meet Guizhi. Guizhi was dressed even more beautifully today, wearing a pink long dress, and under her black hair, she had a red flower stuck in it, which set off her appearance with a kind of joyful aura. Could it be that she was getting married? If she was getting married, then of course she would marry me. As he thought this, it seemed that Guizhi had guessed his thoughts, and read his mind like a torch. She glared at him and said: "Don't have those dreams, do you think I can marry you?" Zhao Ziqiang exploded. Whether she married me or not was not important, but why did she put on such a proud appearance? So he said: "It's not like I'm making this up, there are people who can act as matchmakers to prove it. You've suddenly changed your mind, could it be that you're going to marry Master Gan? You should know that he's so poor right now that he can't even find a bowl of rice, and I'm the one who came up with a way for him." Guizhi said: "Don't slander people behind their backs, I'm determined to marry him. Listen, he's here with the flower car to pick me up. Isn't that the music team playing?" When Zhao Ziqiang heard this, he listened carefully, and sure enough, it was the bugle playing. However, the bugle call was not a love song, but the reveille. Zhao Ziqiang suddenly sat up with a start. Oh my! Where was anyone getting married? It turned out he was just dreaming. There was no need to think about it, he quickly got out of bed. A company commander is always much freer and more comfortable than a soldier. Just after Zhao Ziqiang got out of bed, his orderly had already entered the room to make his bed and bring him water to wash his face. (139)</p>
<p>Small Gardening</p>
<h3 id="e211">Lotus Talk <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Kui</p>
<p>Under this sun, which is as scorching as a flaming umbrella, the lotus leaves are standing tall and turning over the whole pond of green clouds. The white and red lotus flowers are even more like fairies floating on the water, shaded by the green leaves. Their graceful figures and subtle fragrance permeate the breeze, as if sitting opposite a noble person, and all mundane influences disappear. Mr. Zhou Dunyi said well: "Emerging from the mud unsullied, washing in clear water and self-cleansing." In fact, the virtue of the lotus is not limited to self-preservation! The hotter the sun, the more spirited the flowers bloom, standing upright under the scorching sun. This indomitable spirit of resistance is not only the hero among flowers, but also our model. Perspiring while talking about lotuses, to fulfill the small gardening of Spring and Autumn. The types of lotuses The most common lotus flowers are the red lotus and the white lotus. Red skirts and plain clothes, reflecting the lush green canopy, like the goddess of the Luo River, gliding gently on the waves, elegant and serene, truly indistinguishable from poetry and painting! The petals are numerous, growing in clusters like a plate, which is a double-petaled lotus flower. Most of these flowers are red lotuses. They are magnificent, but unfortunately, they do not bear lotus pods. One stem with two flowers is called "twin lotus"; the multi-talented and ill-fated Feng Xiaoqing once wrote in her ashes: "...I wish to use a drop of willow branch water to transform into twin lotus flowers in the world." One stem with three flowers is called a trinity lotus. In addition, there is a double-layered lotus flower, in which another lotus flower blooms from the lotus pod inside after the outer lotus flower has fully bloomed, just like a multi-storied building. There are also blue lotuses and water lilies. I have never seen a blue lotus, but water lilies are foreign varieties. The flowers are white, light red, or light yellow, floating on the water surface, about half the size of Chinese lotus flowers.</p>
<p>Cultivation of lotuses Lotuses are root-born plants; their roots are lotus roots. The cultivation method is mostly to leave the lotus seedlings in the mud, letting them grow on their own. For those planted in jars, during the plum rain season, first spread river mud as fertilizer on top of the lotus seedlings, and dry them in the sun. When the river mud cracks, then pour water and continue to expose them to the sun. The green leaves and red flowers will grow rapidly and bloom. However, for lotus flowers in jars, first, there must be no shortage of water after watering. The amount of water should be gradually increased to maintain a balanced amount. Second, no more fertilizer should be added. My friend, the painter Mr. Liu Junran, has three jars of double-layered lotus flowers in his studio. This year, after adding water, because he felt that the leaves were not large enough, he added some river mud. Unfortunately, the lotus flowers that were already budding in two jars withered and died. The foods of lotuses The lotus flower petals can be used to make flower dew. Lotus seeds and lotus roots, in addition to being eaten raw; cooked lotus seeds can be made into candied lotus seeds and lotus seed paste. Lotus roots can be cooked into dishes, or stewed into cooked lotus roots and lotus root flour. (Mash old lotus roots and filter the juice. After the starch settles, mix it with boiling water to eat. It is fragrant and delicious, far superior in taste to the lotus root flour sold in the market.) Lotus nodes and lotus roots can also be used in medicine. The steamed chicken and meat with fresh lotus leaves are even more delicious dishes in the summer.</p>
<p>Suzhou's lotuses Outside Suzhou's Fengmen gate, the Huangtian lotus roots, and the ten miles of lotus ponds, with red lotuses reflecting the sun and green leaves suspending clouds, have long become the only scenic spot in Suzhou in the summer. The fat, crisp, and tender lotus roots, famous throughout Jiangnan, are produced there. In the gardens, the Su Yuan of Jinde Road used to have trinity lotuses and twin lotuses discovered, but unfortunately, they have not bloomed for a long time. In addition, because the lotus pond in the Humble Administrator's Garden is still large, lotus flowers can still be viewed. The Lingering Garden and Canglang Pavilion, etc., mostly have only ordinary red lotuses, and they are not very lush. In recent years, the lotus flowers in the park have indeed become more prosperous and numerous because a pond has been added. In the early morning or at night, go to the Dongqi Teahouse to drink a pot of clear tea, and the elegant fragrance will be gently carried over, making you feel like you are floating into the sky. Unfortunately, there are too many vulgar guests in the park, who are competing for pursuits of both sexes. How many among the thousands can appreciate the refined interest of lotus flowers? Alas!</p>

<p>— Another Realm</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, the value of editing a book is not lower than authoring one. Especially in China today, where the cultural level is extremely low. For more than a decade since the New Culture Movement, the general youth are still infatuated with the circles of classical Chinese poetry and martial arts and love novels. Not only have various scientific theories not produced much achievement, but even the new literature has not been deeply understood. The popularity of Spring Love Novels is a clear proof. (It is a big mistake to think that vulgar triangular and quadrilateral love novels are only read by shop clerks.) So, the people who are now carrying the task of the cultural movement, instead of specializing in trafficking foreign masterpieces, why not spend part of their energy to do some rehashed editing work for a wider range of people to read? Its significance is more far-reaching than the former. This is the first. Secondly, there are very few who can truly engage in research using scientific methods. Moreover, due to the shortness of time, it is impossible to produce mature works. Even the few academic monographs that are currently attracting attention are nothing more than borrowing from the achievements of foreign research, and the so-called application of materialistic dialectics is especially full of errors. Therefore, if we simply "abandon the fundamental and pursue the superficial" and thoroughly edit and write foreign masterpieces, the editors will be able to obtain beneficial lessons, and the readers will benefit more than reading raw and unrefined local products. This is another reason why I say editing is not lower than authoring.</p>
<p>However, the edited and written products in the publishing industry today cannot satisfy people. The reason is probably that the general editors are forced by life and do not have enough time to search and collect in detail, but only hope to gather a few more pages of manuscript paper and calculate how to exchange a little more living expenses. The result is a patchwork, and its worthlessness is obvious. This is the reason why the current edited and written products cannot be valued.</p>
<p>When I was teaching in the North, I felt a steady difficulty. The general youth have a new desire for knowledge and hope to read some theoretical books, but they cannot understand the many hard translations that are currently available. Recently, I heard that these books have no sales at all, which proves that there is room for discussion in this road. I think it would be best if there could be a book of famous masterpieces that summarizes and simplifies the many profound theories. This is the task of the editor.</p>

<p>Switzerland has many mountains. The mountains are so close together that a person cannot step across. The Swiss build suspension bridges (Pont Suspendu).</p>
<p>| | The bridge is suspended in the air between the mountains. When the gentle feet of a woman walk across, the bridge will shake as if it is about to break; when a heavy car passes, the bridge will only shake, but it will not break. Therefore, with such bridges, Switzerland, which is as beautiful as a large "rockery," is even more beautiful, and the Swiss are famous for building suspension bridges.</p>
<p>The Netherlands has a lot of sea. The sea is higher than the land, and when the tide comes, | | people will be swept away. The tide comes often; but have all the Dutch been swept away? No. They often admire the wonder of the sea being higher than the land because they are most famous for building dikes.</p>
<p>In short, Europeans also encounter many natural disasters and many obstacles, just like the Chinese; but they overcome them and transform them into magnificent sights.</p>
<p>The flooding of the Yellow River in China is a famous natural disaster since ancient times.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a famous natural disaster since ancient times, everyone knows it. But to this day, whenever the Yellow River floods, it is still "Multiple dam collapses in the upper reaches" | | This is our magnificent sight!</p>
<p>Kropotkin said: "Today's scientific inventions are very sophisticated, and there is no need to invent any more for the time being. It is enough to have the public enjoy all the inventions that have already been made." So I say: Today, to avoid natural disasters, we must first extinguish human disasters!</p>
<p>Really, friends! We should first extinguish human disasters, and then extinguish this age-old, detestable cry of "Multiple dam collapses in the upper reaches!"</p>

<p>— Little Snow</p>
<p>Lin Gengbai's "Notes on Jielou Poetry" (July 19th Morning Post),</p>
<p>publishes a poem written by Lu Xun in 1931, which was previously published in "Literary News." The poem goes:</p>
<p>Accustomed to long nights surpassing springtime,</p>
<p>A chaste woman with her brood, her temples streaked with gray.</p>
<p>In dreams, vaguely, a loving mother's tears,</p>
<p>On the city walls, the great king's banners shift.</p>
<p>Grieving to see comrades become new ghosts,</p>
<p>Angrily seeking small poems amidst the knife-edged thickets.</p>
<p>Having recited, I lower my head, nowhere to write,</p>
<p>Moonlight like water shines on my dark robes.</p>
<p>Following the poem is a comment from the author of "Notes on Poetry," saying, "The line 'In dreams, vaguely, a loving mother's tears, 'is excellent as poetry, but the consciousness and emotions of our literati class are revealed involuntarily, which is not the case for Bolsheviks." I don't know if Lu Xun was the kind of person Lin Gengbai described, but I cannot agree that such a person would not miss his loving mother. They have blood, flesh, and rich emotions; why wouldn't they miss a loving mother? Without citing far-fetched examples, let's just copy a passage about Kobayashi Takiji from the recent "Literature":</p>
<p>His mother was already old, and he always worried about her. Amidst his busy life, whenever he had the chance, he tried his best to make his mother happy. The older brother (referring to Kobayashi Takiji) was happy when he saw his mother happy.</p>
<p>Mothers are just as lovable in the eyes of revolutionaries! This can also be corroborated by Ding Ling's "Mother" (Literary Series of Liangyou Bookstore, and another short story). I think that Lin Gengbai, in this regard, has either mistakenly believed rumors and "demonized" revolutionaries, or has simply understood revolutionaries mechanistically from the aspect of "iron will."</p>
<h3 id="e215">Zhang Xianzhong in Sichuan <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Qinwen</p>
<p>I have five Sichuan friends. One day, we gathered to chat, and the topic happened to turn to our ancestral homes. I learned that none of them were true Sichuanese: Mr. Zhao from Chengdu was originally from Zhejiang, Mr. Wen from Huayang was from Hunan, Mr. Li from Zigong was from Guangdong, Mr. Yu from Neijiang was from Hubei, and Mr. Jin from Emei was from Jiangsu. Their ancestors moved to Sichuan and settled down only about two hundred years ago. They all still retain their inherent regional characteristics, and it is very evident once you mention it. Upon investigation, there are not many true Sichuanese living in Sichuan now; most of them were drawn from various provinces. This is because, at the end of the Ming Dynasty, Zhang Xianzhong killed a great number of people in Sichuan, leading to the saying "Zhang Xianzhong killed all the Sichuanese." Although not all Sichuanese were killed, a considerable number were indeed killed. Sichuan was originally a vast and resource-rich land, so people from various provinces were drawn there.</p>
<p>Indiscriminate killing is common among those who wield weapons. However, the purpose of most people's killings is generally to eliminate dissidents. Zhang Xianzhong's motive for killing was not solely for this purpose. His Seven Kill Stele clearly states: "Heaven creates all things for man, man returns nothing to Heaven, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!" From these words, it seems that he was killing as a way to avenge Heaven. According to the records in the Book of Shu and the Mirror of Shu, he often threw small children into the air, letting them fall onto the tips of spears, taking pleasure in watching their bloodied and frantic movements and cries. It is evident that his killing, besides being for revenge on behalf of Heaven, also contained a sense of amusement.</p>
<p>It is said that Zhang Xianzhong had many methods of killing for amusement. Once, he had piled up a large heap of women's bound feet and took his favorite concubine to view them. After looking for a while, he felt that the mountain of small feet was missing two outstanding ones to be placed at the top, so he cut off his favorite concubine's feet and put them on top.</p>
<p>Everywhere he went, he would routinely kill a large number of people and then pile up the heads, hands, and feet separately. After counting the number, he would record it in an account and even carve it on a stele.</p>
<p>One night, Zhang Xianzhong killed his own wife and children. The next day, he regretted it. His attendants did not dare to dissuade him, so he killed them all as well. His wife certainly obeyed him, and his attendants were even more absolutely obedient, not daring to dissuade him from killing his own wife. But he killed them all, which shows that his killing was not solely for eliminating dissidents.</p>
<p>Zhang Xianzhong's killing sometimes stemmed simply from curiosity, such as the case of killing a狀元 (the person who comes first in the highest imperial exam). He greatly respected the狀元, but simply because he admired him to the extreme and wanted to understand why he was so talented, he dissected the狀元 alive to see.</p>
<p>Zhang Xianzhong can truly be called courageous in killing, and his methods of killing were also quite diverse. However, he always did it openly and never used assassination methods, which is something we can still admire.</p>
<h3 id="e216">A Dream of the Moon <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Yang</p>
<p>Moonlight, like water, pours from the gaps in the window into the dark room, playfully kissing my desk. The desk reflects a dim, gray light, and the still objects in the room take on blurry shadows.</p>
<p>I lean against the desk, quietly gazing at that line of moonlight—gentle, elegant, quiet, and mysterious.</p>
<p>"A dream of the moon!" I sigh softly, patting my chest.</p>
<p>Memories have already drifted far from me, but the remaining traces are enough to stir my heartstrings. I like to recall her—my lover who doesn't love me. I half-open my mouth, silently remembering playful words. The tang of plum juice... Moonlight leaks through the willow leaves, scattering over her and me. The evening breeze of June caresses her hair.</p>
<p>"The moon is for reunions," she raises her head, looking at the sky through the gaps in the leaves with bright eyes.</p>
<p>"We are reunited too!" I squeeze her soft little hand.</p>
<p>"Happiness in a dream, we enjoy it with our eyes open." A sphinx-like smile hangs on her lips as she falls into my arms.</p>
<p>"This is a dream of the moon!" I kiss her lips, like red water chestnuts.</p>
<p>I look at the moonlight and smile proudly. I gently caress my lips, for they have kissed those enchanting lips! The moonlight slowly moves, gradually leaving my desk and kissing the floor. Suddenly, my chest fills with anger, such intense anger that it seems unrestrained by my chest and wants to explode. The lips I kissed are probably kissing another mouth now!</p>
<p>I forget my own body, staring blankly at that line of moonlight.</p>
<p>"A dream of the moon!" I exhale and sigh softly.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Ordinary Matters (23) <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Dan Guosun</p>
<p>"'It's really more than twenty li!' said Zhiguang, 'Is that area dangerous?'" "Not dangerous yet," the worker said. "The short devils haven't reached there yet. These past two days, we've been transporting so many things over there at night. It looks like there will be fighting soon."</p>
<p>"'Once the fighting starts,' another worker said, 'it will be dangerous to transport things there. The dangerous place now is still Zhabei, and the most dangerous area is around Baoshan Road to Baziqiao!'"</p>
<p>"'Sanbuzhi is a big array of guns and soldiers,' another worker said, pointing eastward. 'Listen, that array has been making noise for another point-ba-zhong (a period of time)!"</p>
<p>At this point, everyone paused for a moment. Finally, Zhiguang asked:</p>
<p>"Are all the things you're making being carried there by manpower?"</p>
<p>"Almost all of it is being carried," one of the workers said. "We have too few trucks and too many things to transport, so we always prioritize the most important or heaviest things to be transported by truck, and the rest is all carried by manpower, so naturally it's slow!"</p>
<p>"Slow is not good!" another worker said. "When it comes to making things, we can still make it in time, but because we have to carry things, at least one-third of the workers here have to take night shifts to manage the 'carrying' matters, which delays the 'installation' matters! If we add more people to the night shift for 'installation,' then the 'making' people will be fewer, and things will be produced more slowly!"</p>
<p>"We naturally need to find a way to remedy this!" Zhiguang said sincerely.</p>
<p>At this time, Zhiguang had already fallen into a state of deep thought. His near-sighted eyes with deep eyelashes were constantly opening and closing until he finished that lunch.</p>
<p>Then, Zhiguang had a long conversation with these carpenters working at Chenjiabang in a form that resembled both a meeting and an investigation. Finally, he stood up and said to the crowd:</p>
<p>"I greatly admire everyone's enthusiasm for service! I also greatly sympathize with the demands that the workers of Changxing Factory are going to make to the factory! However, in the factory, although I have a kind of power to say a few more words, I can only say it, and I can't just say it and expect people to do it accordingly. Everyone understands this. So now I can only try my best to persuade the factory's owner in the position of a representative! Try my best to persuade the factory's owner! I always want him to be able to implement negotiations!" The crowd applauded, and Zhiguang continued:</p>
<p>"Based on the conversations just now, I also understand the deployment situation of the military authorities. It seems that within a very short period of time, they will build a very solid trench along the thirty-odd li between Zhabei and Wusong. That must be very urgent. Therefore, I understand that the supply of transportation equipment is much more important than other supplies. I am very clear about this, and I will find a way to make the factory owner as clear as I am! Everyone's business, everyone must bear the responsibility, and my heart is on the same line as everyone's!"</p>
<p>These few short and sincere speeches were, of course, very welcome and gave these workers a sense of satisfaction and hope. In their view, the next step was just to find Yao Botang, but Zhiguang also wanted to go to Liujiazhai, so he said to them:</p>
<p>"Now that there's still fighting in the east, how should we go to Liujiazhai at this time?"</p>
<p>"It's hard to say," one of the workers said. "When the fighting was fierce a few days ago, the people of Liujiazhai all moved. That area is too close to Baziqiao! Given the situation today, it seems that it's not necessarily better than that day. It's hard to say if we want to go to that area!"</p>
<p>For a while, it was really difficult to discuss any results, because Zhiguang was determined to go to Liujiazhai to inquire about the soil from Changxing Factory, and the carpenters here advised him not to take too much risk. At this time, the sounds of gunfire in Zhabei had not stopped, and the few airplanes in the air were also circling continuously above the war zone. It wasn't until the leader of the engineering soldiers managing the Chenjiabang area came to inspect at around two o'clock that this small difficulty was resolved.</p>

<p>Commercial News Financial Chips Exhausted</p>
<h3 id="e218">Silver Standard Money Falls and Rises Again <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>U.S. May No Longer Inflate Currency Theory</p>
<p>The Result Is Better Than the Previous Day by Three Yuan and Two Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market initially broke the 800 yuan mark yesterday, but the situation stabilized after the opening, and the market even saw an increase later. This was due to the extraordinary rise in the British and American silver markets, according to foreign telegraphs. The exchange rate initially narrowed but closed higher. The delivery of the long-term silver price from the Gold and Silver Exchange was delayed, with gains ranging from 1.6% to 2%. Stocks surged by more than five yuan, and U.S. cotton also increased by 39 pounds. The initial gross trading opened at 0.45 yuan, retreating to within 800 yuan. After the opening, people's confidence strengthened, and banks opened and immediately bought in, resulting in a steady situation. There were quite a few front-runners, and near noon, the Guangdong consortium bought in, and the market seemed exhausted. The noon closing then broke through to beyond ten yuan. In the afternoon market, under the influence of the Reuter's telegram reporting that the American silver mining industry had expressed satisfaction with the silver agreement, the gross trading suddenly retreated to 0.78 yuan. Finally, with the early Bombay report of a decrease of five annas to one rupee, banks rushed to buy in, and the opening remained firm. Although there was a slight setback later, the market was still tense due to the banks' lack of capacity. This was perhaps due to the influence of the evening edition of foreign newspapers carrying the news that U.S. President Roosevelt may no longer inflate the currency to raise prices. The market</p>
<p>was dry, so that the day's market situation was completely under the pressure of the bulls. Although the Guangdong consortium bought in not much, the pure red price still added 195 yuan. The spread for August and September was a discount of 4.78 yuan. The market situation for today is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 800 yuan and 5 jiao, a further drop of 15 yuan and 3 jiao compared to the previous close. Goods opened at 1.5 yuan, and the exchange market also opened strong. The recent selling price was 1 shilling, 3 pence, 4375 for British exchange, and 30 yuan and 625 for U.S. exchange. Bingxing, Hengyu, Hongli, and Zhaofengchang immediately bought in at the start of the session, while Huabi and Mecali all bought in. October went from half a yuan to four yuan. Mecali offered 4375 for the same month, retreating slightly, but Fuchang, Dachangxiang, and Daxingyong bought in again, and U.S. dollars for October at 3.75 were difficult to settle, rising further to 6.5 yuan. Goods Yuangxingyong and Yuanmaoyong slightly sold, retreating to within 4 yuan. It was previously heard that HSBC's listing was only 125 for British long and 375 for U.S. dollars. Hengyu, Zhengchang, Zhaofengchang, and Dadecheng scrambled to buy, and Andada bought 25 for U.S. dollars in October and rose to 9.5 yuan. Bingxing and Yifengyong sold off, gradually becoming downstream. Daxingyong bought in and then offered again, Huabi offered 1875 for U.S. dollars in October and 375 for November, and the price dropped to 6.2 yuan. Fuchang, Yuanmaoyong, and Bingxing bought in slightly and saw a pull-up. Zhifengyong and Yifengyong sold strongly, still retreating to 5 yuan. Mitsui bought 25 for U.S. dollars in October and stabilized. Hengxing, Fuchang, Yifengyong, Zhifengyong, Qingfayong, and Shenkang jointly bought enthusiastically, and U.S. dollars for October at 1875 were difficult to settle, rising to beyond 10 yuan. Shanghai offered 125 for U.S. dollars in October, and Zhaofengchang and Fuyu sold off and then fell again. Yuanmaoyong and Daxingyong even fell to 4.5 yuan. Hengyu and Dadecheng maintained some struggle, and when Hengyu, Yuanheng, Yu, Shunli, Quntai, etc. supplied one after another, the exchange market seemed to loosen</p>
<p>and retreated to 0.4 yuan. Qianchangxiang, Hongxing, Zhengchang, and Hengyu took the opportunity to buy low and formed a rebound. Finally, Hengxing, Daxingyong, Dadecheng, Fengyong, etc. bought in one after another, and the market seemed exhausted. The Guangdong consortium also bought goods, and although the bank offered 125 for U.S. dollars in October, it still rushed to 13.5 yuan. The noon closing was 812.5 yuan, and the goods were auctioned at 12 yuan.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, due to unfavorable foreign telegraphic news, it immediately retreated to 0.78 yuan. Wanxing and Yuanheng bought in at once, and the opening still pulled up to 812 yuan. Goods opened at 1.5 yuan, and retail investors pressed strongly, retreating to 0.98 yuan. Hengyu, Fuchang, and Dadecheng all bought in, and Mecali bought 0.625 for U.S. dollars in October, and soon 30 yuan was difficult to settle, and it rushed to 16 yuan. Zhaofengchang slightly sold, with a slight setback of 1.5 yuan, but due to Shenggda and Hengxing's strong purchases, U.S. dollars in November at 0.625 were difficult to settle. Shenkang and Qianchangxiang also bought U.S. dollars in October, although at 875, the supply was also scarce, and it rose further to 19 yuan. Zhejiang then offered 8125 for U.S. dollars in October, and Shunli sold, and the situation turned around. Yifengyong, Hongli, Wanxing, etc. jointly sold off, and Shanghai offered 0.625 for U.S. dollars in November, and the market rotated and retreated, but it was still able to struggle at around 6 yuan for quite a while. Later, with Hengxing buying in again, Zhifengyong and Hengyu also bought in, and it rose again to 9 yuan. The exchange market had no major movements, and Qianchangxiang and Hengtai sold off, and in an instant, it fell again to within 7 yuan. Goods Zhaofengchang took the opportunity to buy low, and the closing was then 819 yuan. After the closing, goods rose sharply, once rising to beyond 20 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 21 yuan, and Fuyu and Hengyu limited sales, and finally retreated to within 20 yuan. The highest price of the day was 819 yuan, the lowest was 800 yuan and 5 jiao, with a difference of 18.5 yuan. The result was an increase of 3 yuan and 2 jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The posted price, because HSBC's listing of U.S. dollars was 375, was 29 yuan and 125, and the combined silver standard money price was 824 yuan. According to the closing price, it was only pressed by 5 yuan, at most by a strong 23 yuan, less than 14 yuan less than the previous close. The registered account for this month was 825 yuan, for August 818 yuan, and for September 813 yuan. The water replenishment in the morning was 825 yuan, and the water replenishment in the afternoon was 831 yuan. The pure red price still added 195 yuan, because the source of goods in Tianjin was again abundant. Inside the market, Tongfengheng sold 100 taels to the silver shop, calculated at an additional 210 yuan, and sold 70 taels to outsiders at an additional 208 yuan. Shencheng (Hanzhuang) sold 150 taels to Jinfu, at an additional 203 yuan. For August and September spreads, Hengyu discounted 21 lots to Zhifengyong, Chengfengyong discounted 98 lots to Zhifengyong, at 4.7 yuan. Qianchangxiang discounted 140 lots to Yuanxingyong, at 4.8 yuan. In the afternoon, Chengfengyong discounted 105 lots to Yuanmaoyong at the same price, and Yuanheng discounted 28 lots to Zhifengyong, at 4.7 yuan. There are still 2,527 lots remaining for this month, and 1,603 lots for August.</p>
<p>There were not many transactions inside the market, and the chips were exhausted. In summary, Shenggda, Hengxing, Dadecheng, Shenkang, Bingxing, Hengyu, Fuchang, Yuanheng, and Qianchangxiang all bought in, while Zhaofengchang, Yuanmaoyong, Cuitai, Yifengyong, Hengtai, and Qingfayong sold off. The Dalian consortium Shunli bought in more than 900 in the previous session and sold more than 700, with a net purchase of 196 lots. Wanxing made more than 1,400 lots in total, with a net purchase of 7 lots. In the afternoon session, Wanxing made a total of 1,106 lots, and the net position was even.

The Guangdong consortium Hengxing bought in approximately 500 lots, and Shenggda also bought in September chips totaling 16,730 lots.</p>
<p>Banks Have No Selling Capacity</p>
<h3 id="e219">The Exchange Market Finally Tightens <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign telegrams were received, with London big bars long and short all up 375, American silver up 1.875, British against American down 4.75, and American against British up 4.25.

The recent selling price was 1 shilling, 3 pence, 4375 for British exchange and 30 yuan, 0625 for U.S. exchange. Banks opened and immediately bought in, and then, with the announcement of HSBC's listing of British long at 125 and U.S. dollars up 375, it was not seen as powerful and became even tighter. Before the opening of the afternoon market, due to unfavorable news, the gold market retreated, but the Bombay telegram reported a decrease of five annas to one rupee, and the banks bought in strongly, gradually trending tight. Finally, the banks had no selling capacity, extremely tense. By the close, the recent selling price was 1 shilling, 3 pence, 125 for British exchange and 29 yuan, 375 for U.S. exchange, with British exchange up 25 and U.S. exchange up 125 compared to the previous close. Both buying and selling were present in the banking sector, but the selling power was not strong. The gold industry sold approximately 300,000 yuan in the previous session, and it was difficult to close out in the afternoon market. The Guangdong consortium also bought in, and speculator Mr. Wu bought in shillings in the previous session, and the stock company also bought U.S. dollars in the amount of 100,000.

<p>Yesterday, the interbank market price remained absolutely stable, with both the morning and afternoon markets at 5 fen, and the adding of water to the tou was also without market movement and done by book transfer. The abundance of tou's backup and the leisure of its use can be imagined. As for the receipt and settlement aspect, due to the collection of various payments, the receipt and settlement of transactions was quite complicated, adding more than usual. However, the money houses also had increased public bond receipt and settlement due to the 25th period. Yesterday's receipt and settlement of foreign public bonds amounted to more than 45 million, and the receipt and settlement of tou kuan was more than 7.5 million. The remittances from various routes were limited, still only slightly more than 400,000. The transaction of interbank drafts was more than 4.6 million in the morning session for book transfer, and more than 1.1 million for new transactions. The transaction in the afternoon session was more than 600,000, and the transaction in the Small General Association was more than 700,000. The bank receipts and settlements were more than 2.1 million in silver and more than 2.2 million in foreign currency for the foreign merchants' receipt and settlement of drafts. The special kuan receipt and settlement was more than 2.56 million in silver, and the various goods, remittances, taxes, and other mortgages and dian kuan receipt and settlement was more than 5.2 million in silver and more than 4.12 million in foreign currency. The inbound warehouse was 500,000 in silver and 500,000 in foreign currency. The receipt and settlement of drafts for the Chinese merchants' banks was more than 3.34 million, the various goods, remittances, taxes, and other mortgages and dian kuan receipt and settlement was more than 7 million, the special kuan receipt and settlement was more than 3.7 million, and the inbound warehouse was 800,000.

<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small foreign coins suddenly became extraordinarily tight in the morning market, with a top price of 850 yuan, a sudden increase of 7 yuan compared to the previous day.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3 id="e223">A Slight Abnormality in Public Bonds <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>丨Entirely Due to Differences in Bull-Bear Swaps and Settlements丨</p>
<p>Yesterday was the last day for trading July futures at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. The demand for settlement or swaps from both bulls and bears was relatively balanced, and there were no significant changes in the market. New trading for August was dominated by buyers, and the market was limited to the supply and demand of chips and arbitrage trading, so price fluctuations were very stable. Today, only August futures are traded. Starting tomorrow, September futures trading will be added. As for the future outlook, we will have to wait until after the settlement on the 28th to observe the trend again. At the opening yesterday morning, the "18 Customs" bonds rose by 30 cents, reaching new highs for both near and far-term bonds. However, the "Compilation &amp; Dismissal" bonds up to "19 Goodness" showed slight weakness. When trading reached "20 Rolls," prices rebounded sharply, rising by 30 cents. Afterwards, all saw gains, with salt tax rising by 40 cents. This was entirely due to the different settlement or swap strategies of the bulls and bears in this month, resulting in this abnormal state, with no trend to speak of. Trading in the second session gradually thinned out, and the market price remained within this range, with mixed gains and losses, amounting to about 20 to 30 cents. In the end, prices rose from 5 cents to 55 cents, with longer-term bonds seeing greater gains. The "Compilation &amp; Dismissal" bonds for this month declined slightly by 20 cents due to more bull swaps. August's "Gold Length" bonds declined slightly by 15 cents due to arbitrage.

<h3 id="e224">New York Stock Market Rebounds Due to Short Covering <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>A report from the New Asia Trading Company stated that on Monday (24th), the New York stock market rebounded strongly due to short covering. "Wet" stocks rose by about 10 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was 3,420,000 shares. Market conditions seem poised to rise further. The weakness in US cotton has led to the liquidation of many long positions. Due to a lack of sellers, prices rose by over 30 points compared to the previous day. Grain trading was unusually cautious. Wheat initially rose and then fell back, resulting in little change. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is stable, but the situation is slightly firmer due to the rise in US cotton. However, exchange rates are loosening, so sentiment remains good. Sales to customers are more active than before, but the market remains flat and weak. Sellers for this month are well-prepared for delivery, and factories are receiving goods. According to some, the range of fluctuations in the yarn market is currently very small.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Human Labels Show Slight Recovery <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>The human label market opened flat in the morning. In the second and third sessions, due to the rising trend of US cotton and good sales in the yarn market, buying interest in the market was strong. Prices for each month rose by 2, 4, and 5 cents. Total transaction volume for the day was 12,350 bales. Sales included 450 bales from Sui Jiang, 400 bales from Xin Chang, 650 bales from Sen Kang, 400 bales from Yuan De, and 400 bales from Chang Feng.

<p>丨Abundant Delivery of Storage Cotton丨</p>
<p>The storage cotton market is weak. Some yarn factories have already stopped production and are selling off their stored cotton. Sellers are actively delivering, and the pressure from floating longs is leading to settlements, so the market is loosening. However, new cotton bulls are holding firm. The weather is good, and new cotton is growing vigorously. More and more producers from various regions are coming to Shanghai to sell.</p>

<p>Flour: Yesterday, after the market opened in the morning, the flour market for each month showed initial stability. The quoted price for imported wheat in Chicago was about 20 to 30 cents, while Canadian wheat rebounded by 80 to 90 cents. Due to the indecisiveness of imported wheat, sentiment was less enthusiastic. Therefore, after the opening, the market did not look good. Later, this month's contracts rebounded due to factory replenishment. It was rumored that there were many head contracts, and factories were losing too much, so they mostly recovered on their own, thus reversing the trend. Customer trading in longer-term contracts was very thin, with only external speculation continuing to buy, and the amount was not large. Observing the later trend, this month's contracts are bound to be squeezed due to head contracts. As a result, this month's contracts rose by 1 cent compared to the previous day, August's by 0.5 cents, September's by 0.75 cents, October and November's by 0.25 cents, and December's by 0.75 cents.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, after the wheat market opened in the morning, it generally showed a stable trend. The quoted price for imported wheat fluctuated. Sentiment was in a wait-and-see mode. This month's settlement was also approaching, and receivers other than factories had to settle. Therefore, at the opening, prices fell as low as 3.67 yuan. However, longer-term contracts tended to stabilize due to very few sellers. When the afternoon session opened, sentiment slightly improved. It was rumored that factories would receive 30 to 40 trucks of this month's contracts, and many of the standards were not met. Therefore, sentiment rebounded, and longer-term contracts also rose. As a result, this month's contracts improved by 3 cents, August's by 2 cents, September's by 5 cents, November's by 2 cents, and December's by 3 cents. The spot wheat market remains stable, but there are many medium-quality goods, and high-quality goods are not abundant. Quoted prices: Qintong wheat 3.70 yuan, Yangzhou wheat 3.60 yuan, Jiangyan wheat 3.72 yuan, Xia wheat 3.59 yuan, Xia Xia wheat 3.546 yuan, Gao Xia wheat 3.61 yuan, Xinghua wheat 3.68 yuan, Su Xia wheat 3.80 yuan, Pudong wheat 3.20 yuan, second-grade to 10 cents, boat wheat 3.54 yuan, a total of more than 7,500 bags, which were taken away by Fuxin.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sales of bean cakes remained strong. A total of 10,000 pieces of customer cakes and 14,500 pieces of factory cakes were sold. Customer cakes showed stronger rising power, while factory cakes were slightly reduced by 1-2 cents. The soybean market showed a slight loosening in the midst of this active cake sales. Yesterday, Zheng Yangguan soybeans, in addition to 200-300 bags purchased by export brokers at a price of 4.92 yuan, factories purchased 8-9 trucks at prices of 4.88 to 4.885 yuan. Also, Yingzhou soybeans sold 12 trucks at a price of 4.80 yuan, leading to a rebound in market sentiment. However, with the gradual arrival of new soybeans, these old soybeans are bound to be affected.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable as the bidding price fell and then rose. The guild set the initial market price for common grade 24 coarse sand white sugar at 20.15 yuan, later down by 2 cents, setting the zero price at 1.03 yuan, slightly better than the previous day.

<p>The new Hunan lotus seeds market initially saw prices as high as 32 taels per picul. Due to the small quantity, they were all purchased by the Guangdong Gang. Now prices have fallen by 4-5 taels.

<p>Yesterday, due to demand from foreign countries, British firms such as Jardine Matheson and Xiehe aggressively searched for core-pulled Zhenmei tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other areas, resulting in very strong transactions. Large quantities of needle-brow tribute tea from upper and middle villages, as well as No. 1 Pingshui Zhucha tea, were also purchased by British and French Bai Tou and other villages. High-grade green tea has seen a turnaround, but market prices are slightly lower by 3-4 yuan. There was no progress in the market for Wenzhou Zhenmei Zhucha tea yesterday. There seems to be no hope for activity in currently low-quality goods. Both British and Russian firms have considerable intake of Qimen black tea, and Chinese merchants are becoming more assertive, with the market showing a general upward trend.</p>

<h3 id="e238">On the Decline of "Public Morality" and "Human Sentiment" <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Huicheng</p>
<p>When one opens the newspaper, one is almost always confronted with news of theft, rape, suicide, and so on. Everyone then sighs about the decline of public morality and human sentiment. Indeed, this is the truth; society is filled with evil. However, we should not be like those Confucian moralists who vaguely and indifferently sigh, for what good does that do? We should calmly analyze the reasons for the decline of "public morality" and "human sentiment" with an objective eye, and ultimately consider how to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Naturally, people should first fill their stomachs, but the conditions of life are not so simple. In addition to food as the mainstay of life, there are many desires that need to be satisfied. For example, in a certain physiological state, we need sexual intercourse, and at certain times, we also need clothing to keep warm. However, in today's deformed society, can these problems be widely solved? Except for a class of bourgeoisie who can enjoy or exceed these conditions, the remaining people, who outnumber the bourgeoisie, are struggling even with the prerequisite of eating. But humans ultimately have needs. So they rob, steal, and rape. However, some of them feel that these actions are not something they dare or want to do, so they take the path of suicide. In this way, moralists sigh about the decline of public morality and human sentiment.</p>
<p>If we analyze their actions with a logical attitude, whether they are crimes, then we must admit that morally, they are wrong and have committed crimes. But from the starting point of their thinking, they are not only not committing crimes but are also right. Because they are humans! They are animals that should need to eat, wear clothes, and have sexual intercourse!</p>
<p>However, their actions need to be corrected: those who commit suicide should bravely rise up; those who rob, steal, and rape should calm down. Everyone should stand on the same battle line to solve their problems of eating, wearing clothes, and having sexual intercourse. Because doing it alone is easy to run into obstacles.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Am I Really Dominated by the Environment? <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Fei</p>
<p>Mr. Li is a graduate of XX University, a man rich in reason. When he first left school life and took a job at a gold exchange, starting to come into contact with society and its ways, he was very conscientious in his work. He was very harmonious with his colleagues. In particular, he was able to be cautious in the disbursement of money and in social interactions. Originally, when he was at school, he heard that a friend had been dismissed for being addicted to gambling, a relative had been dismissed for being infatuated with women, someone had committed suicide due to economic reasons, and someone had an unfortunate incident due to something else. He often wondered, is the temptation of society really so strong? Is the dominance of the environment really so great? So, at the beginning of his employment, he was determined to break through the environment and not be dominated by it. The question of "Am I really dominated by the environment?" was constantly swirling in his mind.</p>
<p>His thinking was too keen. He believed that in the environment of "prostitution, gambling, and smoking," it was easiest to be tempted and dominated. So he had a "four nots" principle: do not enter flower bushes, do not gamble, do not smoke or drink, and do not wear fancy clothes. He was able to work hard to do this, not to be the same as the world. Everyone admired him and gave him the nickname "old beyond his years." But in the gold exchange, all that was present was the stench of gold and the desire for profit. He saw that colleagues who ran side businesses often made a fortune, either earning three thousand or more than ten thousand. His heart could not help but be envious. His eyes could not help but be red. He thought that making a fortune was so easy, so he unconsciously began to act. Then he joined in the operation, hoping to make a fortune. Who knew that his first venture into the world, the first thing he did, happened to be during the world gold tide. The price was falling day by day, and he lost more than a thousand taels. Although he was frustrated, he continued to trade. In less than a week, he lost more than two thousand taels. The amount was large, and it became difficult to cope. Friends and relatives who knew about it advised him not to blindly squander his money in this serious period. He could only wait for an opportunity and not make a futile sacrifice. After listening to them, he suddenly realized. "Am I really dominated by the environment?" He immediately stopped the investment, endured the pain for a while, and continued to practice his four nots principles. One day, someone went to ask him, "Why did you turn back so quickly?" He then gave a speech. "Breaking through the environment is not easy. I don't need to talk about European and American theories. In short, the degradation of virtue and the baseness of personality are the result of being dominated by the environment. For example, very diligent and honest rural girls, after arriving in the city, are imperceptibly influenced and gradually become cunning and fashionable. How many can not be dominated by the environment? Conversely, the ladies and gentlemen of the city, the four major things in life, food, clothing, housing, and transportation, are indeed satisfactory and comfortable. Once they are called to the countryside, they feel uncomfortable living and are unaccustomed to the language.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>It is boring and very lonely and depressed. How many people can create a new environment? Therefore, in a certain environment, it is not easy to meet the three states of wealth, poverty, and power, which cannot be indulged in, cannot be moved, and cannot be bent. In another environment, such as suffering their minds, laboring their muscles and bones, starving their bodies, emptying their bodies, and disrupting their actions, there are not many who can move their hearts, endure their nature, and increase what they cannot do. Just like I was originally determined not to be dominated by the environment, but I was influenced by invisible temptations and was almost misled. Fortunately, I reined in the horse at the precipice and stopped abruptly. In the end, I was able to maintain myself. Therefore, we must not only not be dominated by the environment, but also break through the environment, and be able to create a new environment for ourselves in order to have a way out." Everyone admired his high opinions and admired him for having his own views.</p>

<p>— Lie Huo</p>
<p>Perhaps it is sympathy for the same illness, or perhaps the problem is too serious. Every morning when I open the newspaper, besides flipping through to see if my article has been published, I stare at the "Self-Job Introduction" people, carefully reading their brief biographies, and carefully pondering the cause and effect of this problem. The result is like a heavy rock, pressing tightly on my heart, suffocating me and preventing me from moving.</p>
<p>This column has been added to this publication for about half a year. The number of people published daily is as many as twenty-one or nineteen, and as few as five or six, averaging ten people per day, totaling 1,800 people. Recently, many newspapers have also set up this column, plus the unrecorded number of people who have not submitted their applications, totaling ten times as many, which is 18,000 people. Although this statistic is not accurate, I think it will only be more, not less. How many people are there in Shanghai? There are already such a huge number of unemployed people, and this problem cannot be considered not serious.</p>
<p>Looking at their backgrounds, most of them are high school graduates, and very few are elementary school graduates. University graduates with bachelor's degrees are next in number, and even some have eaten Western bread abroad for more than ten years.</p>
<p>Looking at their talents and learning, some are proficient in Chinese, some can speak Shanghai, Cantonese, and various local dialects, some can speak, write, and translate English, some are deeply rooted in accounting, and some can draft and draw to serve as engineers.</p>
<p>Looking at their resumes, some have held important positions in party and government agencies, some have worked as employees in foreign firms and companies, some have worked as private secretaries, some have worked as principals or teachers in primary and secondary schools, some have operated their own businesses, and some have worked as managers in other people's companies.</p>
<p>Their backgrounds cannot be said to be humble, their talents and learning cannot be said to be shallow, and their resumes cannot be said to be low. Although not all of them are top-notch talents, at least each of them has a skill. In today's Chinese society, which is in urgent need of talent, they should not be left idle. However, the facts are displayed before our eyes. They are the rejected unemployed.</p>
<p>Why are so many people unemployed? The first reason is the economic downturn, which causes a panic phenomenon of instability in all industries. Therefore, all industries adopt a tightening policy, matters that need to be undertaken are shelved, and those that have been undertaken are reduced in scope. Layoffs and salary cuts are often heard, and therefore, the number of unemployed people in society has increased.</p>
<p>Because of the first reason, of course, the phenomenon of "more people than jobs" is formed. The organs for placing talents are limited, but the people who need to be placed are overcrowded. Therefore, the limited organs are preempted by the following types of people and firmly occupy them.</p>
<p>(1) Those who are good at flattering and boasting</p>
<p>(2) Those who have nepotistic relationships</p>
<p>(3) Those who have a certain background or system</p>
<p>(4) Those who have special talents and learning</p>
<p>This causes the unemployed to be unemployed for a long time. Those who start later leave school and have nothing to do. Therefore, the number of unemployed people is increasing. Under such circumstances, let us look at the further tragic prelude of the unemployed.</p>
<p>Although they are confident in their talents and learning, they see that it is impossible to sell themselves, so they try to suppress their desires and sell themselves at a reduced price. Looking at the prices such as "salary is not counted" and "half-duty," only seeking to provide food and accommodation, it can be seen the intensity of the unemployed's desire for a job. As long as they can barely solve their own lives, they are satisfied. And the eyes for employment are even lower. Those who have been secretaries are willing to be clerks, and those who have been senior staff are willing to be runners. Even high school graduates are willing to be followers. In short, as long as someone accepts them. But unfortunately, where is the response? How many have succeeded?</p>
<p>Since there is no way to go in the city, why not return to the vast countryside? Unfortunately, the countryside is more lifeless and poorer. War, bandits, taxes, natural disasters are urgently destroying it. Can you return? Can you make a living if you return?</p>
<p>These two days, the editor has published a notice saying, "This column has a lot of manuscripts accumulated and will temporarily stop accepting submissions," which makes me suddenly feel that the summer vacation has arrived, and the graduation ceremonies of various schools have been held. It is also said that it is related to "the accumulation of many manuscripts." Graduation is unemployment. This is the conclusion of current education that cannot be concealed.</p>
<p>In this way, at the present stage, the unemployment problem is only getting more urgent. However, "when things reach an extreme, they will turn around."</p>
<p>Perhaps there will be a day of overall solution soon.</p>

<h3 id="e242">A Painful Plea <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I have a problem and would be very grateful if you could answer it for me:</p>
<p>Here is a record of my daily life:</p>
<p>I get up at seven o'clock and do the sweeping and wiping until seven thirty. Then the store's side dishes... Then, our manager gets up and immediately takes flour and buys snacks. (Our store is a family business, and the manager's parents and elder siblings live above the store.)</p>
<p>At ten o'clock, we eat porridge. By that time, the porridge and side dishes are all gone, and only plain porridge is left. Whether you eat it or not is up to you. After this task is finished, I do store business. But all I do is move things around and send letters, nothing of any real substance. After lunch, I have to wash the dishes and chopsticks. In the afternoon, it's time for snacks again. Everyone eats different things, so going to one place and then another takes at least two hours. After dinner, in this hot weather, I'm fetching water and carrying bath tubs for people. After ten o'clock, it's snack time again. It's not until twelve o'clock that the day is truly over. Our store subscribes to the Shen Bao newspaper, but the manager has ordered that we are not allowed to read it or any other books. Because when your eyes are on the book, you won't notice if there are thieves outside. Also, after twelve o'clock, we are not allowed to turn on the lights. (Because the manager goes to bed at ten o'clock, and his family doesn't go to bed until twelve o'clock.) After I go to bed, I want to practice and study, but who would dare to violate such an order?</p>
<p>Sir, I am sixteen years old. The capitalist is using these means to make me an incapable person. How will I be able to support myself in the future? This kind of life is truly not a human life! But if I don't like it and go home, that is simply not an option. If I stay here any longer, the years will fly by, and what skills will I have to save my future? Now I have told you my troubles, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>What methods can be used to make capitalists improve their treatment of employees?</p>
<p>I want to study so that I can support myself. Please tell me where there are free schools. If there are none, please teach me how to study on my own. What methods can I use to escape this kind of environment and find a bright future? I anxiously await your reply.</p>
<p>Answer: The letter describes the painful life of an apprentice, which truly represents the life of apprentices in general stores in China. There are tens of thousands of apprentices in China, and they are all groaning and living under this kind of heavy oppression. However, they can only groan at most, and they will never rise up and resist! The rough-handed and bare-footed workers, when they are truly oppressed beyond endurance, will gather together and shout. They will strike, resist, and their collective passion will erupt like a volcano! They will use their collective blood and collective will to find their path to a bright future. But apprentices will never do this! They will only groan and groan, oppressed to death! This is the fundamental weakness of our apprentice class! Because they do not know how to unite and do not know how to resist, they have been oppressed for who knows how many years, and their lives have not improved at all. Who can be blamed for this? It is all because they themselves are not making progress. I sincerely sympathize with the suffering described in the letter, but I do not have any pity for you. What I want to ask you is: why don't you resist? Are you afraid of hunger, ridicule, insults, and all kinds of oppression? If you have the courage to face the enemy on the battlefield, what are you afraid of?</p>
<p>You asked a few questions, and I will answer them below:</p>
<p>(1) What methods can be used to make capitalists improve their treatment of employees? Forgive my shallow knowledge, but I have never heard of a capitalist who would be willing to improve the treatment of workers! Capitalists are destined to exploit workers in order to get rich, otherwise, they would not be capitalists. There are plenty of ways to improve our own treatment, and that is to rely on our own strength! If you talk about making capitalists improve, that will only happen when all the capitalists are dead, and that hope will never be realized in your lifetime.</p>
<p>(2) Although Shanghai is a metropolis, there are not many free schools. Or, as a step back, you could go to a relatively inexpensive night school. (This newspaper currently has several vocational schools.)</p>
<p>There are schools in the Public and French Concessions, as well as in Zhabei, with courses in English, arithmetic, Chinese, accounting, Japanese, and Russian. The tuition is generally six yuan per semester for beginners and ten yuan for advanced students, which is not expensive. If you are determined to study, you can register at any time. But since the letter says that reading the newspaper is also against the store's rules, then I'm afraid this method of studying may not be feasible either.) For self-study, you can learn what you need. For example, if you want to do business, you must pay attention to ordinary commercial correspondence, calculation methods, and commercial knowledge. In addition, the most important thing is the life experience you gain in your daily life, which is the best kind of knowledge. For example, if you were forced to become an apprentice because you didn't have money to study, and you are suffering all kinds of oppression because you are an apprentice, this is your life experience. You should investigate this: why can't I study? Why do I have to be subjected to the unreasonable oppression of the store manager? Then think about how I can overthrow this oppression? If you can find a way out from this, then your future is truly promising, and it will be much more beneficial than just reading a few dead books! Finally, you ask what methods can be used to escape this kind of environment? In my opinion, based on your abilities and environment, the best thing to do is to go back and discuss it with your parents, clearly demanding to find another job. If your parents do not agree, you should persevere to the end. I think this goal can definitely be achieved.</p>
<p>In short: on the one hand, you should use a spirit of perseverance to seek harmony; on the other hand, you need to move forward with unwavering courage! First, put aside hunger, cold, desires, and everything else, and then you can gain life!</p>

<p>— Xilin</p>
<p>(20) I'm not necessarily the only one keeping her company tonight!</p>
<p>Today, Shi Qiao and Wang Hua received two hundred yuan from Chen Tianren. They each took sixty yuan as their share,</p>
<p>and divided the remaining eighty yuan among their accomplices.</p>
<p>Shi Qiao went home, repaid the five yuan he borrowed from Meizi, and paid one month's rent of twenty-eight yuan, leaving twenty yuan for food.</p>
<p>In the evening, he took a bath at the hot spring bathhouse. When he returned home, he had nothing to do. He wanted to talk to Meizi, but it was inconvenient with Livinoff at home. So he thought of the third concubine, but he didn't know if she was at home. He went to knock on her door, and only A Zhen was sitting in the room, thinking about something. He asked:</p>
<p>"Where did Madam Danli go?"</p>
<p>"She went to the Marie Hotel and won't be back tonight," A Zhen said, tilting her head. When Shi Qiao showed a look of surprise, she winked and said, "Doesn't Mr. Li know? I thought you were going to open a room with Mr. Li! Mr. Li, you and our madam are really close!"</p>
<p>"Did she go alone?"</p>
<p>"Oh my, are you jealous of her too? She's also jealous of Mr. Li. Isn't Mr. Li very close to that landlady, that Japanese woman?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" Although Li Shi Qiao defended himself, he felt a pang of jealousy in his heart. He knew that he didn't truly love the third concubine, but the third concubine did love him. He felt it was an insult that someone who had loved him was now loving someone else. A Zhen saw this secret and took the opportunity to use her seductive tricks. For example, when she spoke to Li Shi Qiao, she didn't turn her body around, but instead, her buttocks were sticking out towards him, and one side of her face was twisted over her shoulder, with her eyes looking back at him from the corner of her eye. This charming posture was somewhat of an imitation of the third concubine, but when done by A Zhen, a newly ripened fruit, it had a different kind of agitation. She deliberately trembled her voice and said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Li, you're having a lot of peach blossom luck!"</p>
<p>"This thing is half a catty compared to the third concubine! Shi Qiao almost wavered. But A Zhen's posture, which was similar to the third concubine's, reminded him that the third concubine might be making that kind of posture to someone else. So he decisively returned to his room, put on his clothes, and headed for the Marie Hotel.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the Marie Hotel, he didn't know which room she was in. He saw several familiar waiters and didn't want to ask them, so he had to walk out dejectedly. On the road, the traffic of people and cars was still as lively as before the war. Red and green advertising lights, billboards, were still covering the streets, and the prostitutes under the lights were standing in rows, and the business was even more prosperous than before the war. The reason is that the people did not get excited because of the war, but because of the stimulation of the war, they felt that their anger could not be vented, so they turned around and wasted their energy aimlessly! Li Shi Qiao may be one of them... Of course, he couldn't see the phenomenon at the bottom, and he was thinking wholeheartedly about how to do it.</p>

<h3 id="e244">The Silver Screen Replaces the Book <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Rui</p>
<p>In modern times, movies have become a necessity for the general public, almost as important as eating, and reading the newspaper every day. However, it is regrettable that this "food" is only limited to the wealthy and the petty bourgeoisie, and that this "food" itself can only provide the audience with "leisure" and cannot provide them with nutrition.</p>
<p>Because of traditional ignorance, ignorance of the people, and cultural backwardness, the majority of the Chinese people lack knowledge. They are almost like starving and withered disaster victims. There are certainly not many such people in the cities, but in the countryside, they make up almost the entire population. How thirsty these people are for the nourishment of knowledge!</p>
<p>Movies are the vanguard of construction and the tool of education, therefore, at this time, they should unreservedly awaken to their great mission. The slogan we are shouting is "The silver screen replaces the book!"</p>
<p>This sentence has already been realized in European countries, especially in the Soviet Union. Anyone who has seen "A New Life" has probably already learned it. That kind of educational method is truly many times greater than the power of books. However, Chinese films have always ignored this point. Recently, the term educational film has gradually come to the attention of Chinese people, and they have realized that building a new China can only start with educational films.</p>
<p>How can the silver screen replace the book? What should be put in educational films? The opinion of Italian film expert Sardi is: "For example, showing major events in various countries, including local events that can be used as a reference,</p>
<p>Folklore and landscape films that show the natural scenery of various countries and the folk customs of the people; vocational training films that show the subjects taught in technical schools; films that show the industry of various countries at home and abroad, such as building railways, building ships, building cars, building roads, building bridges, etc. Secondly, there are health and disease prevention films that show how to prevent and treat infectious diseases. The scope of scientific films is the widest, from the life of insects to crystalline minerals, from plant embryos to the application of light. As for agricultural films, they are even more important. They can be used to promote the best planting methods, so as to harvest abundant crops, and show the continuous progress of farming machinery. As for military films, they are a great help in training new soldiers. So we know that the content contained in educational films is really a lot!</p>
<p>China is in urgent need of this kind of major work, and at the same time, I expect that the emergence of this kind of film will definitely arouse the curious attention and enthusiastic welcome of the vast majority of the people.</p>
<p>Whether it is about the future of the film industry or the education of the people, "the silver screen replaces the book" should give us deep attention. Comrades in the Chinese film industry! How should we work hard to do this step-by-step work of chiseling mountains and opening roads!</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e245">Review of "Eternal Regret" <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Mi Wu</p>
<p>Small film companies often cannot compare with large companies in terms of equipment because of economic factors. However, the content of a film will not affect its quality because of the size of the company, so many people are often more tolerant of the products of small companies, which naturally has a considerable reason. However, I personally advocate not letting go of the content of the film. This is my attitude towards criticizing the films of small companies (if it can be said).</p>
<p>"Eternal Regret" is a film that fully believes in the doctrine of retribution. It believes in the cause-and-effect relationship between good and evil and suffering and happiness, and at the same time, it also believes that the law is absolutely correct. Therefore, it not only explains the criminal's actions, which are finally exposed and arrested, but also writes that the criminal escapes in an airplane, but is still shot down and destroyed by the so-called "missile" that was prepared in advance. Isn't this very obvious?</p>
<p>Like other films, the insertion of love in the middle is inevitable. However, this insertion only serves to give the supporters of the law a very satisfactory result, and has no other effect.</p>
<p>We often see old martial arts novels in which the author not only creates a high official to enforce the law, but also creates several "heroes" to help enforce the law. "Eternal Regret" completely contains the meaning of this kind of novel.</p>
<p>Speaking of technology, the director is extremely mediocre. He used the same two flashback shots, which made the audience feel disgusted. The inserted shots were too long, making the audience feel that the development of the story was cut off. The subtitles say that Zhiqi's own invention of the airplane, if it is completely completed, will be one-third faster than ordinary airplanes, but there is no scene of the airplane being completed in the middle, and it takes off. And since it is one-third faster than ordinary airplanes, it is certainly beyond the reach of cars, and on the screen, we see that the airplane has already taken off, and the police call the Public Security Bureau, and then the detective returns home to get the "airplane." After such a long time, the airplane should have disappeared long ago, so why does the airplane fall down immediately when the missile is shot up? Also, since Zhiqi is a long-time bandit, why did he not notice anything when Lilian sneaked into his secret room? And what we see on the screen is that Zhiqi deliberately turns his face away and avoids her, letting her in.</p>
<p>In addition, because there are few interior scenes, the light is generally not very good, and even in the interior scenes, the lighting is too uncoordinated.</p>
<p>In terms of acting, it can be said that no one can perform. The better one is still Wei Guangshou.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Lianhua Establishes Six Factories in Shanghai <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>The films produced by Lianhua have always been praised by the Chinese people. The company has been nurtured by the love and cultivation of the Chinese people, so it is urgently seeking to increase its efforts in terms of quality and quantity. Recently, Mr. Zhu Shilin, the Shanghai branch manager of the company, has seen that society attaches importance to Lianhua films, and that a large number of products are not enough to meet the needs. Therefore, in addition to the original first and second factories in Shanghai, he has set up the Lianhua Sixth Factory (the Lianhua Third Factory is in Hong Kong, the Fourth Factory, but Mr. Du Yu is focusing on researching sound films, and the Fifth Factory is in Peiping, which has been temporarily suspended due to the situation). A preparatory office has been set up in the branch office. On the one hand, he is looking for a suitable location to build a studio, and on the other hand, he is preparing to produce products. On July 22, he hosted a banquet at the New Asia Hotel for the important employees and actors of Lianhua. More than 100 people attended the banquet, which was a grand occasion for a while. At the banquet, Mr. Zhu Shilin announced the purpose of establishing the Sixth Factory, and made a speech on the relationship between films and social education, the importance of Lianhua to the Chinese film industry, and new hopes for colleagues. The speech was very pertinent. Then, the representative of the colleagues made a congratulatory speech, and it was not until about 10 p.m. that the banquet ended with joy.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Lianhua Second Factory Two Fairies <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Lianhua Second Factory has a night fairy, Cai Chusheng. Although he has recently set his own rules to get rid of nightlife and become a worker under the sun, no matter how he changes, the name of this night fairy cannot be taken off. Recently, in addition to this night fairy, the factory has discovered another fairy, Zheng Jiduo, but this fairy's working hours are exactly the opposite of the night fairy's. He likes to work when the sun has not yet risen. It was found that the first day of filming "The Way Out" was at 4 a.m., the second day was at 5 a.m., and the third... to the present, it has been very early in the morning. According to Director Zheng himself, "The plan for the day lies in the morning, so it is best to work in the most precious morning light of the day!" So, colleagues gave him the name of Morning Fairy. Mr. Zheng Jiduo, the Korean director, laughed when he heard the name.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Zheng Junli "The Way Out" Bleeds <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Lianhua Second Factory, Director Zheng Jiduo's "The Way Out", the filming speed is very amazing, since the start of filming, it is planned to shoot more than two scenes every day. Director Zheng leads cameraman Qiu Yiwei, stage manager Meng Junmou, Zheng Junli, Tan Ying, Tang Tianxiu, Yuan Congmei, and many temporary actors to shoot inside and outside scenes, which is very busy. In the past few days, the scenes shot are: Penglai Market, the Bund, Nanjing Road Bank Street, pawnshops, and hospitals, department stores. The scenes of Chen Tai's wife's death, pushing the car and colliding with the bus, and being injured by the car after being disappointed in seeking employment, were all shot smoothly. However, when filming the scene where Chen Tai was injured by the car, Director Zheng, in order to be realistic, advocated not using photography skills, but carefully instructed the actors to do their jobs. However, the car drove straight at Zheng Junli, although not at high speed, but the momentum was quite fierce, so Zheng Junli was knocked down, his hands were scratched, and blood was dripping. However, he still endured the pain to complete the performance of the scene before using medicine to bandage it. His spirit of sacrificing for art is really admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Xu Qinfang Complains About Her Big Belly <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Set Designer</p>
<p>Xu Qinfang has been having a big belly and raising sons every year since she married Chen Kengran, the former boss of Youlian. As the ancients said, "There are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest!" Someone like Chen Kengran, who works so hard at the work of having descendants, may be called a filial son.</p>
<p>The couple joined the Mingxing Company together and cooperated on a "The Road to Fitness," which has not been screened for long. They wanted to make another "Fragrant Grass Beauty," but this star, who is good at having a big belly, is having her belly slightly raised like a small hill again. Chen Kengran had no way to deal with it!</p>
<p>Finally; he thought of a way to invite Xia Peizhen to play the lead in "Fragrant Grass Beauty." Xia Peizhen had just recovered from a new illness! She originally wanted to decline, but she couldn't stand the pleading, so she had to agree, and now she has started working.</p>
<p>It's ridiculous! A few days later, Xu Qinfang said to people, "This time I had a son, I swore I wouldn't have any more. I think; this is just saying it for fun. How can it be done!</p>

<p>— Jiaxiang</p>
<p>Up-and-coming director Yuan Yiting. Lately, he has been suffering from having to let others benefit from his work. Last month, he joined forces with several like-minded people. To create the Huahua Film Company. His debut work is "Conscience Trial." But the next film, "The Result of Seeking Marriage," because it is a short comedy, has been completed in advance. It was previewed at the company on Avenue Joffre on the evening of the 23rd. The results were satisfactory. On the left is a small image of the heroine of the film, Misha Lei.</p>
<h3 id="e251">"Maternal Light" Plays in Nanjing <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>The Lianhua new film, "Maternal Light", which took half a year to make, will be shown in the Nanjing Grand Theatre in this city, under the extreme eagerness of people in Shanghai. Originally, the film, which was produced by the Lianhua First Factory with all its strength and took half a year, was not intended to be shown in this hot summer weather, but the company authorities recently had to advance the public release due to the urging of public opinion. It is generally expected that when this film is shown, there will be a large audience.</p>
<h3 id="e252">A Tour of European and American Studios (7) <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Yunyan</p>
<p>In fact, this is a precarious studio, because the British Lion Film Company can never be as prosperous as President Juarez was in his time. He is a comedian and a filmmaker who is best at making entertaining films. He has made many good films, which have enhanced the reputation of the Pikons studio. Pikons studio is certainly not a luxurious film studio in the UK. It is not built with white marble, but because many of the best British films have been produced in this studio, there is such a place in the minds of a group of people in society.</p>
<p>(9) Elstree (England)</p>
<p>The British International Film Company Studio is in Elstree, England.</p>
<p>In the UK, there is no film center like Hollywood. The places where films are made are scattered around London in a chaotic and disordered manner, but many people generally acknowledge that Elstree (in Herts) is the Hollywood of the UK. There are many studios there, such as Bretner Studios and Royal Studios, but the largest studio in the UK is the British International Studio, opposite Royal Studios. The buildings inside occupy an area of 40 acres. The International Studio was established in 1928. It has nine huge theaters for filming, spread over three huge areas. Two of the theaters are enclosed in corrugated iron houses, which were originally used for shooting silent films. There is also one that is very modern in all its equipment, with three sound stages connected to an impermeable trough in the floor below the water, which is prepared for shooting swimming films. For example, the scenes of the submarine disaster in "Seven Heroes" were shot using this impermeable pipe. Next to these three major studio houses are the splicing room, the laboratory, the car room, and the restaurant, which is one of the best of the British studio restaurants. People from the Royal Studio next door often come to visit. Their dressing rooms are always stocked with countless pounds of snow powder, boxes of powder puffs, and countless gallons of liquid colors. The factory is also very large, with a total of more than 150 carpenters. Every year, it uses 50,000 feet of strips, 10,000 feet of wide boards, and almost half a ton of iron nails a week. The spirit of the material department is very serious. If they are asked to prepare six machine bicycles used by the American police or many Chinese stored eggs within a day, they can do it without hesitation. (To be continued)</p>
