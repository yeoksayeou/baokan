<h3 id="c14">熱河失陷後之危機 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>繼遼吉黑半壁山河淪亡之後。正當全國人民焦灼期冀之中　突然霹靂一聲。熱河又宣告陷落矣。</p>
<p>誠然熱河之陷落。固早在吾人意料之中。蓋以平日惟知横征暴歛榨壓人民膏血之湯玉麟。而謂其能拚死抗日。亦决非吾人所敢信。抑且此落日殘照之孤城。在日人犀利砲火與重兵攻撃之下。其終將無法支此危局。則亦爲事實必然之結果。獨是吾人以爲熱境叢山峻嶺。爲天險之勢。但使我軍能具三分抗守之决心。敵人亦决末由長驅以直入。　同時自熱河情勢轉急。華北軍事當局。即再四表示死守熱河之决心。守熱抗日之軍事公債。亦已發行。或者在相當的抵抗之下。至少可以使此對抗之情勢。延長數月之時日。即熱河而終不免於失陷。日人亦必支付絶大之代價。然而今日則自日軍正式發動侵熱。不過旬日。承德遂告失陷。在叢山峻嶺天險之地。日軍竟能如人無人之境。則在熱河前綫之我軍。直等於爲日軍之嚮導。否則無論如何。熱河之失陷斷不至若是之迅速也。</p>
<p>熱河竟已失陷矣。據平方電訊。張學良表示憤慨。嚴責義軍一槍不發。令其不准後退。并嚴緝棄城潛逃之湯玉麟。此種嚴厲之處置。固爲吾人所極端贊同。獨是九一八以來。失職喪地。望風引退之將領。政府從未予以若何之懲罰。則今之湯玉麟棄城潛逃。亦非偶然之事。湯玉麟固罪不容於死。然而不容於死者。又豈獨湯玉麟一人。棄東北者何人棄錦州者何人。棄榆關者又何人。夫惟有不抵抗之主將。而後湯玉麟乃敢於棄城潛逃。亦惟棄城者不加懲罰。而後湯玉麟乃敢無所顧惜。今熱河失矣。湯玉麟逃矣。全國人民悲憤北顧。已同感無淚可揮矣。若僅僅通緝一湯玉麟。詎能緩和全國人民之悲憤心理耶。</p>
<p>熱河之失。不失於日軍之進攻。而失於我國一貫的［一不爲民族謀生存鬥爭］之政策。或者一般淺見者流。以爲熱河之失。日人之目的已達。今後彼此庶幾可以相安而無事。觀於公債反見高漲即可知之。殊不知熱河失陷而我國今後之危機。乃愈深重。第一·華北屏障既撤。平津無險可守。華北遂無日不在日人控制之下。第二熱·熱河既陷。東北義勇軍接濟之路絶。東北三千萬人民期冀政府收復失地之念。亦歸於幻滅。第三·由於熱河事件之刺激。華北或將形成［抵抗］與［不抵抗［兩種主張之對立。更予日人以進窺之藉口。第四·自熱撤退之軍隊。將如何安置。治安問題。亦極堪憂慮。總之在遼吉黑三省陷落之後。而尙有熱河之陷落。在九一八不抵抗之後。而尙有熱河之不抵抗。吾人日言共赴國難。而共赴國難之結果如斯。我民族誠無以自解於世界。而我軍事當局亦無以自解於我全國之人民也。</p>

<h3 id="c78">蘇聯農業之機械化（下） <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>蘇聯通信（一月十五日）</p>
<p>農業機械化之程度　所謂農業機械化、就是農業　上一切、生產過程、如耕耘·撒種·收穫·打榖·與夫施肥、慨應用機器來操作、而排斥人手勞動、這亦呌做農業工業化、</p>
<p>農業工業化、這漫說後進國、就是在先進的資本主義國度裏、亦尙未做到、因爲天然條件（氣候）和社會條件（土地私有、分成小塊）的關係、資本家不願在農業上去投資冒險、在農民本身方面、多係小經濟、無力購備機器、所以在資本主義之下、就形成了先進的城市與落後的農村之顧著差異、</p>
<p>蘇聯自革命日起、土地已收爲國有、且自五年計劃實施後、農民旣多半集體化、則鄕村裏田地、已成廣漠一片、無小塊之分、換言之、更具備了農業生產機械化之先决條件、所以現在蘇聯的經濟政策、質言之、亦就是竭力去消滅前社會所遺留下來的這種差異、廣大的實施農業機械化、</p>
<p>農業機械化之主要種力爲曳引機、就是上述各種操作機器、由曳引機引其動作、因在田野連在工廠裏是不相同的、列寗在時、夢想全蘇聯農村裏須有十萬架曳引機來工作、但至一九三二年底、全蘇聯農業中工作的已有十四萬七千八百架曳引機、（在一九二八年時共只有兩萬六千七百架）、利用的農户達六百八十二萬、計佔全體農户百分之二四九、這此農户都是加入集體農莊的、至在蘇聯農業中有很大作用的國營農塲之完全機械化、更不用説了、</p>
<p>一九二八年、全蘇聯農户三分之一、尙是用着木犂來耕地、這木犂是代代相傳了幾千年的東西、但到一九三二年、蘇聯農村中此種木犂、業已廢棄、播種總面積百分之四八、春季播種面積百分之五三、已由曳引機犂來耕耘、此外用馬曳機之農户、一九二八年時僅二十八萬七千家、計爲全體農户百分之一八、到一九三二年、已增至七百五十萬户、計全體農户百分之三○五了、</p>
<p>又在一九二八年時、全蘇聯春季播種面積四分之三、是用人手撒種籽的、到一九三二年、主要播種用具已爲播種機、計達春季播種面積約百分之四○、一九二八年用舊式鐮刀收穫榖物的面積達四千四百萬公頃、一九三二年、榖物主要收穫器、已爲曳引收穫機丨丨新式穫打複合機了、同樣、一九二八年時、有四千萬公尺之收成、乃是用鏈枷和其他手打榖形態的、到一九三二年、主要者已爲曳引打谷機及穫打複合機了、</p>
<p>總而言之、現在蘇聯農業生產過程一半、業已機械化了、尤其在質量方面注意的、就是機械化的、不是個體農户、而是集體農莊和國營農塲、這是說在農民集體化程度越高的地方、而機械化的程</p>
<p>度也越大了、</p>
<p>以地域論、大半烏克蘭·北高加索等農產地帶機械化程度最大、比如以各地曳引機數目論、烏克蘭所有曳引機、居全蘇聯所有曳引機總數百分之十八·三、北高加索居百分之一二·二、中窩爾加居百分之九、下窩爾加居百分之七·五、西比利亞西部居百分之八·五、中亞細亞居百分之七·五、卡查斯坦居百分之五·一、　　更以蘇聯所有農業機器數值論、在一九二八年共計十四萬萬四千九百萬盧布、（以一九二六丨二七年物價計）一九三二年已增至二十三萬萬盧布了、在第一次五年計劃諸年間、應用於農業的機械、計達十六萬萬盧布、在一九二八年時農業中所有機械、不過值十一萬萬四千九百萬盧布而已、由此亦可想見其農業機械化之突進、</p>
<p>農業機械化之槓桿　機器曳引機站網蘇聯實施農業機械化之槓桿、就是機器曳引機站、它是由政府選擇農業區城適中地方所辦的、其作用極大、兹擇最主要者叙述如下、</p>
<p>（一）可促進農民集體化運動、蘇聯刋物上稱［機器曳引機站是集體化之眞正組織者、］蓋某村農民剛成立集體農莊、一時尙無力購備機器、就可向機器曳引機站去租借、租費在收穫後交納、此時尙未加入集體農莊的貧中農親眼看到集體農莊用機器耕種之利益、也願意加入了、　　（二）機器集中在一起、其使用效率、大爲增加、比如在一九二八年、集體農莊所有曳引機共兩萬架、那時利用的農户、共只四萬五千户、一九三二年、集體農莊和機器曳引機站兩者所有曳引機八萬五千架、因成立機器曳引機站之故、利用農户（均係加入集體農莊者）竟達六百八十二萬家了、而且有機器曳引機站服務的這六百八十餘萬户集體農莊農民、其播種面積三千五百三十萬公頃、即每户平均有五·一八公頃、而未有機器曳引機站供用的八百一十萬户集體農莊　農民、其播種面積爲三千一百四十萬公頃、即每户平均爲三·九公頃、一千萬户個體農民、其播種面積爲一千九百八十萬公頃、即每户平均只有一·九八公頃、由此看來、有機器曳引機站供用的集體農莊農户勞動生產量、要比個體農户多兩倍半、比未有機器曳引機站供用的集體農莊農户多百分之三七、機器曳引機站之效用、槪可想見、</p>
<p>可實施國家對集體農莊之領導　所以、蘇聯所謂實施農業機械化、主要就是去發展這種機器曳引機站網、在一九二八年時、這種機器曳引機站、只有一所、一九三零年有一五八處、一九三二年已有兩千四百九十八處、其馬力共計有九十三萬八千匹、利用的集體農莊達百分之四十、</p>
<p>同時機器曳引機站、已成爲蘇聯農村政治與文化中心、每站設有醫院·學校·電影院·俱樂部·圖書館·等、此外黨政機關辦公處亦在此處、這在消滅城市與農村之差異上、機器曳引機站、更有重大作用的、</p>
<p>曳引機驚駛員及其他各種機器司機員、均由機器曳引機站來培養、一九三一年、進入曳引機、穫打複合機及汽車等司機員訓練班的、共計達一百餘萬名、一九三二年、已增至二百五十餘萬名以上了、</p>
<p>第二次五年計劃中農業機械化之綱領第二次五年計劃决定、至一九三七年、農民全體須集體化、農業生產須全部機械化、機械化之槓桿、　丨機器曳引機站、至第二次五年計劃末、要增加至五千五百到六千所、預定到一九三四年春季、所有集體農塲均可包攬於機器曳引機站網之内、</p>
<p>在第二次五年計劃期間、蘇聯每年可造十七萬餘架　曳引機、全部農業　生產機械化、預計需要一千五百萬匹馬力、所需曳引機、即可由自造者充分供給、其他附屬用具、計需九十萬萬至一百萬萬盧布、比之一九三二年產額　要多十倍至十一倍、</p>
<p>同農業生產機械化有連帶關係的、就是燃料問題、曳引機現在所用唯一燃料爲石油、至第二次五年計劃末、農業生產機械化所需一千五百萬匹馬力、計要一千五百萬噸揮發油、要提煉如此巨額揮發油、計非原油四千五百萬噸不可、這樣、就要佔一九三七年所預定石油採額之一半了、</p>
<p>此外、第二次五年計劃期間、規定農業生產一部分要電化、到一九三七年、至少須有九十萬萬至一百萬萬克羅瓦特小時電力、施用於農業、預定首先電化的、爲牛乳製品、國營及集團養蜂塲、次爲工藝作物、如棉·蔴·糖·蘿葡·等田野作業電化的、至多三四百萬公頃而已、</p>

<p>讀者願問的答覆，每一個都令我欽佩的五體投地，我每天吁嘆的難題，也請先生指南一下，我十二歳的那一年，由父母媒妁，許給一個深鄕土豪的兒子，那時我懞懂不知，當然不去反對，以後我知識漸漸變進，才知道婚姻是我最大問題，我留心探聽我未婚夫的一切，並也見過面，他年不滿弱冠已是個酒鬼，每飯先酒，他仍在家庭請八股先生敎詩經古文’能有用嗎我住在城市裏，略受了報紙雜誌的薰陶，那樣不農不工的，坐吃祖上餘蔭的，老實說，我不願嫁他而願死！我鄰居有一個和我年貎相若的男子，他雖處境寒微，却能說是人格清高，我經過一年多的注意他，他的一切習慣正如我的理想，我倆有時邂逅，兩人都非常羞澀’不用說是互相慕變‘我有一天接着一封無頭尾的信，我猜是他所寫，從此就書翰頻通’我也曾過幾次險和他在公園談心，彼此更形投契，可恨我雖想否認道純粹專制的婚約，脫離這不具生產能力，不合性情的未婚夫，但是我這樣陳腐家庭，蹤然把我私衷，向父母明白要求，决不能遂我所願，我的將來絶望已極，我聽說夫家不久將要看期娶我，不啻我死期將近，先生常說自殺是切不可，我一朝出嫁在僻鄕荒鎭的榨取平民血汗土壕，决絶我意情投契的愛友，我覺是生不如死，惟先生霧海南針，請示答覆。答··女士來書字跡娟秀，文理清通，在私塾中讀過一年書，竟有此成績，自然是不可能，而是女士本有一種卓犖的天資與自修的美德的結果，可敬可敬！然而以如此有志力學，毅然欲有所樹立的女子竟爲舊式家庭所束縳，爲不自由的婚姻所痛苦，又不禁爲之廢書三嘆，並至以無積極援助女士之力爲恨！爲女士計··第一步設法說動令尊和令堂求他們讓你出來求學··可是你暫且不可表示拒婚之意，只說待求學歸來，再做道理··若是他們答應你的要求，那第二步就有辦法，你到上海之後，理頭讀一年書，或自已辛苦一點，並帮助你的愛人讀書，切不可馬上結婚，或和他發生進一步的關係；因爲你們都不知道防禦生育的方法，假使生出别的結果來，那你們不但此後没有快樂可享，反而要受罪。待一年以後，你們在外都有點根基，那時才寫信將不能和那土豪的子弟訂婚的理由告訴他們，請他們原諒，或許他們不會固執已見，不然的話，你們若果眞是兩情相愛，那就脫離家庭到工廠作工，獨立生活，互相帮助，雖然在物質方面苦一點，但在精神上當可以得到一點補償。婚姻問題，是現代社會問題之一，若果社會問題不根本解决，這種問題是不會得到圓滿解决的。我們所貢獻的意見，也是不得已的一種辦法，還要看女士的奮鬥力量如何咧！</p>

<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>上海市内尤感覺缺乏而急於要提倡的，乃是傳染病醫院。據目前狀况而論。專收危險性傳染病，如腦膜炎，腹紅熱，天花等症的醫院，祗有數處。公共租界工部局，設有隔離病院，而内中的華人部，實在不得華人之贊許。因此病家聽說要送工部局醫院，都有毛骨悚然之懼：法租界廣慈醫院，别設陳離醫院部仍。可是制度狠偏斷，與其他醫界十二分的隔膜。並且祇收法租暂的居民，也不甚方便。南市公立上海醫院，於以上各病流行時期。也設着相當的隔離舖位，可是他那方面房屋太不合式，過於多收險症，於其他病房不無妨礙。閘北從前有個公立醫院，乃是華人自辦，專收此等症候，地點建築甚好，資格也最老，可是醫務完全交與一個外國人包辦，頗有不合新學理的地方。如腥紅熱不肯多注血清，並且每天喉頭搽藥，常常使病人支擋起坐，不顧心臓危險，都是我親眼目覩。如今閘北兵災以後，該院也就受了打擊。此外紅十字會對於隔離病院，時辦時輟，衞生局又無欵開辦，所以開業醫師診到此類病症，最爲躊躇，勸令病家送以上各院、他們大都不肯，送入其他病房，必被拒絶，聽其在家治療。大不合公共衞生的原則，而尤背謬正當醫師的責職。於是熱心的醫家，不管病家願與不願，報告了工部局把病人硬接了去，略爲消極的醫家，順從病家的要求冒着十二分危險，就在家庭中，仍用每天出診的生意經，替他治療，最消極的，就將這個病人完全放棄，讓他去吃仙方也地，吃湯頭也好，更管了他們他染不傳染，上海的所謂大傳染病，也就在這畸形的醫藥之下流行着，靠天起伏，工部局居然每星期有個報告在報上發表，說天花若干，腥紅若干人，那裏是可稽的確數？凡是吃仙方，請喉科，貼膏藥的，可說完全不在其内。就有死亡傳染都非容易調查，然而假定所有各症，全照合法的手續送入隔離病院，恐怕上述幾個醫院又必有人滿之患，這種情形，社會上有思想的應該值得注意罷。</p>
<p>其次再談到夏季流行病的霍亂醫院，俗稱時疫醫院，大都因爲霍亂病患者，以平民勞工居多，所以辦理這種醫院的方式，往往是施診式，慈善式的，但是霍亂病並不限定平民生啊，中資商人，達官大賈，飲食不愼，照樣也患霍亂，於是就發生住院問題的困難了。若說高等療養院或私立醫院，收容霍亂，實在有些違法，若說與販夫走卒同居一室，又雅非上流社會人所願，雖然有幾處時疫醫院，分别着頭二等收費的房間，可惜性屬臨時，事尤忙亂，頭二等也考究不到那裏去。儘有病人向時疫醫院的人說：「我情願多出院費，請你們診治看護格外道地些。一而醫院中人都祗好回說：「此地人多事雜，祗好一視同仁。」你不才作主的時疫醫院，尤其是完全施診性質，憑他願意出資，我們不好收受半文，而對於看護供應，也實在無可道地，因此我覺得上海市内，在每年霍亂流行的時期，不妨適應事實上的需要，另外　組織一二處高等時疫醫院，用完備的消毒設備，妥當的看護醫藥，收費較昂，舖位不必過多，專供有産階級的偶患霍亂者之用，（即赤痢炎自然亦可並收兼蓄）以免其他普通醫院受那些傳染性病者的攪亂，又免得許多病人，因怕進平常時疫醫院而使家庭里衖中充滿了傳染性排泄物的流弊。</p>

<p>吐血爲一種症象。並非病症。一般人以爲吐血即是肺癆（意指肺結核症）。　實吐血之原因甚多。肺癆不過爲其原因之一種。即以所吐之血而論。有從肺部來者。有簡接由心臓來者。有從腸胃來者。又有從咽喉鼻腔口腔等處來者。俱須區别診斷。不能混爲一談。且肺部所來之血。亦未必由肺癆所致。例如肺部有梅毒。便可吐血。肺氣管擴大破裂。便可吐血。肺部血管血塊栓塞（主因乃爲心臓病）。亦可吐血。肺部患有放射綫菌或脾脫疽菌症。俱可吐血。肺部患有包囊虫或二口虫症（又名肺蛭其症象絶似肺癆。）更有吐血之可能。若女子患有倒經。或大動脈血瘤穿破於肺氣管内。則其血亦可從肺氣管吐出。曾記某病人忽然吐血。醫者診爲肺癆。並　愛克司光攝圖爲證。其後屢治不愈。仔細診之。方知爲心臓病。蓋患心臓病者之愛克司光攝影片。有時亦可與肺癆等症絶似也。至於從胃部吐出之血。亦非全係胃病所致。例如肝臓萎縮。血液壅塞於食道之下部及胃部。遇有機會。便可出血。其血上湧。即是吐血。年老之人。其血管容易硬化。胃部血管硬化之後。亦極易出血。其血積於胃部大多。即被吐出。又如患傷寒症或肓腸炎症之人。有時亦可吐血。其他如腸部血管栓塞。或惡性淋巴腺瘤。或黄疸等症。俱可爲吐血之原因。至於鼻口腔咽喉等處。有時因種種關係。便可因創口而吐血。不知者乃以爲肺部或胃部出血矣。爨昔在德。曾見有患神經病之女子。以吐血病來肺病部求診。屢經診察。莫究其血從何而來。惟案上痰盂。每晨見其滿積血水而已。嗣經夜班看護暗中調查。方知其所吐之血。乃爲其特以髮針穿刺牙肉所致。凡此種種。不一而足。若謂吐血即爲肺癆。豈不憤事。是以醫者如遇病人吐血。倘稍有疑惑。則必須仔細診斷。區别病因。對症下藥。然後方可奏效。而病者如患吐血。則亦不必過於驚惶。切勿以爲即呈肺癆。而灰心萬狀。必須求醫者仔細診斷。方爲上策。至於區别診斷吐血之法頗繁。有時需要愛克司光檢騐。有時需要顯微鏡檢騐。有時需要血清檢騐。有時需要化學檢騐。種類繁多。恕不具　。他日有暇。當爲文詳述之。惟關於上項檢騐一事。最好能自己施行。蓋有時遇及危急病人。而又必須檢者。萬不能再延時問也。</p>
<p>吐血之原因。旣已複雜如上述。則其主治之藥。亦隨病而異。自不能拘執一方也。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c162">防治腦膜炎之芻見 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 王堯白</p>
<p>（一）流行之經過</p>
<p>腦膜炎從前不過偶一流行而已。自歐戰後。一變而爲盛大之流行病。查美國醫學會雜誌之記載。本病之大流行。起自歐戰後。一九一七年首先發見於奥國。以後自西租東。由法而英。一九一九年事達美洲。一九二０年春。滬報記載此病見於上海。查則越太平洋而至中國矣。旋自滬埠沿鐵道綫而至江浙各地。可按圖　索。是年三月。余在常州。最初發見時。余嘗將美醫報之論文譯登各報紙。備同　之考證。自此以後。後年冬春之交。時有本病流行。於最近數年間。尤爲盛行。且以江南與浙西。爲盤踞之區域。大概由於交通之便利。及消息之靈通。故見聞級多歟。</p>
<p>（二）症狀之變異</p>
<p>本病普通症狀。爲發熱。頭痛。嘔惡。漸乃頸肌强硬。以至角弓反張。然亦有多種例外之特殊病候。易於誤會。如湖州鄉間初見本病時。患者祗稱少微頭痛。無熱無抽搐等狀。檢查其脊液。甚清徹。但未幾遍身起紫色斑。再檢查脊液。則病菌甚多。自起病至不治。僅十餘小時。又杭州有一小孩。方八月。病　　腫脹。家屬疑爲時症。要求檢騐脊液。無細菌。但病重而死。家屬願作屍體解剖。以察究竟。結果查得腦膜確有發炎之狀。腦膜炎嘉興所見之本病。初狀爲嘔吐泄瀉。極似霍亂。而脊液中可檢　病菌。故遇有可疑之症。醫師與病家均宜顧及之。</p>
<p>（三）防治之意見</p>
<p>（甲）預防　方法不一。然最有確效者。當推注射腦膜疫苗。然須在尚未流行之前。早爲施行。蓋疫苗之注射。每星期一次。連用三次。方有充分之免疫力。故宜在冬季或春初即提倡注射。始可防患未然。若已與病者接觸。則須以血清作爲預防注射。湖州衞生會。在城鄉注射防疫苗者四千餘人。未聞有一受染。某醫院中職工百餘人。概施預防注射。不意後有護士三人。傳染本病。查之則伊等適因故未經預防注射。此極有力之反證也。常州去年本病流行特盛。臨時發起此項預防注射。後分南北二區辦理。余主持之福音醫院　任北區。共注射三千餘人。未聞受注射者有人再受傳染（乙）治療　本病當然以腦膜炎血清爲唯一特效藥。所當注意者。施用時期愈早愈佳。當本病流行時、遇類似之病。即可用腦膜炎血清作筋肉注射。往往先發制人。弭患無形。若必待脊液檢　發見病菌。然後始用。每致誤事。蓋常有初施檢查。無菌可見。迨數小時後病狀突顯。再查脊液。菌已甚多。救治未免過遲。又若僅用脊液注射不甚見效者。則兼用靜脈注射。較可獲益。</p>
<p>（四）血清之産地</p>
<p>對於血清及疫苗之産地。有一種要之事實。應請國人特别注意。常人之見解。多有舶來品精美勝於國産之成見。惟治傳染病之血清或疫苗。則適得其反。蓋據各地敎會醫院實騐之結果。國産之血清疫苗。效果竟遠駕舶來品之上。聞者初以爲此不過因出品較會新鮮耳。但據西友康博士之意見。則由病菌種類之關係。聞歐戰時亦有同樣之發見。戰士來自環球各處。血清等藥品。亦自各地搜羅集中。支配應用。不</p>

<p>意偶而以甲國之血清。治乙國之病人。竟效力大减者。再三研究。始悟製造血清之菌種。若採自同地之人。種類相向。攻效即鉅。余於徵集治療腦膜炎之成績時。獲此發見。亟當報告於國人。更望國内製造血清疫苗之機關。對出品能精益求精。以供國人之需要也。</p>

<p>— 愚公</p>
<p>倭宼侵凌。有加無已。國家命脈。不</p>
<p>絶如縷。推原禍始。莫非不平等條約有以致之。因有不平等條約。日人得在我國境内公然調兵遣將。伺隙閧釁。以造瀋陽之變。淞滬之役。榆關之戰。現又大軍壓境。侵犯熱河。毁我藩籬。窺我堂奥。皆恃不平等條約爲護符。是不平等條約。乃亡我國之先聲。而各種不平等條約之簽訂。則導源于道光二十年之雅片一戰。是則雅片問題。關係我國存亡。不可不有所叙述。考雅片在英又爲Opium爲最有用之藥。亦爲最有害之藥OOpium一字。源于希臘字Ｏpion意即汁也。查當時草木之汁。可作藥用者。皆曰Opion嗣因留粟花汁。較其他草木之汁。功效爲大。於是Opion乃專指罌粟花汁。至世界人類。何時知罌粟花汁。有藥物上之價值。則知者甚少。歐西醫學鼻祖（Ｈipocrates）赫波克里特氏。（耶穌紀元前四百六十年至三百七十二年）雖知其葉。可供食品。但不知其藥用之效能。最初發明其催眠用者。當推（Ｔarentun）達倫敦氏。（耶穌紀元前二百四十年）至第一世紀台額斯卡里氏（Ｄioscorids）對於雅片之藥用效能。及採雅片之方法。始作明確之紀載。但雅片聲譽當時並不甚著。甚有對之持反對論調者。以最著名之藥物家（Ｇalen）加倫氏。尚認雅片爲極端危險物。不宜輕用。以致雅片功用。埋没千數百年。直至一五三六　一六一四年。有（Ｆelix　Ｐlatter）白拉特爾氏出。始打破成見。推演其效能。至一六六九年。英國醫師（Ｓydenham）賽登漢氏。將雅片製爲浸酒。至今沿用不衰。但在雅片上有極大貢獻者。乃爲一八一五年　（Ｓerturoer）色特勒氏所提出之　鹻。此　鹻名Morpheum蓋所以紀念夢神名Ｍorpheus者。至採雅片方法。係在晚問下露時。採者以刀向果外皮作多數划痕。痕之深淺。殊　重要。大深則雅片烟汁。有損失之虞。二十四小時内。採者須往田問。將流出之汁。仔細刮取。盛于盤中。再將此乾汁。裝成　圓形塊。此即市售之雅片也。考雅片初至中華。乃在第九世紀。當時來華西醫。名（Moors）摩爾史氏者。</p>
<p>用治療痢疾。頗著功效。至十七世紀末葉。華人始開始吸食。誰某作俑。不得而知。傳聞所及。或云波斯人。或云土耳其人。初以雅片與烟葉混和吸之。其方法展轉傳入中土。經華人製成特殊器具。用烟槍挑吸。於是祇吸雅片。而不與烟葉相混和矣。雅片輸入中國。最初爲量甚微。至一七八七年。英國東印度公司。在香港附近成立雅片貨棧。對於雅片運輸。爲大規模之增加。吸者乃日益衆多。華人吸烟成癮。因癮致弱致廢。比比皆是。中政府不得已取嚴厲手段。于一七九六年。下諭禁止吸烟。於一八二０年。禁止運雅片之船舶開入廣州。乃引起一八四０年雅片之戰。結果中國慘敗。並於一八四二年締結江寗條約。開放五口通商。從此雅片運華。不爲違禁品矣。從此種種不平等條約。繼續簽訂矣。而列强即藉種種不平等條約。爲侵略中國之工具矣。是則造成今日之國難者。爲不平等條約。而造成不平</p>
<p>等條約者。則爲雅片。雅片雅片。汝直爲帝國主義之急先鋒耶。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>問　麻疹的預防，對於生命，有没有危險。</p>
<p>答　没有危險。大概死亡率是百分三。可見幼兒和　病質的小兒却比較的不良。</p>
<p>問麻疹的一般治療法是怎樣的？</p>
<p>答　使病室温暖，濕潤，薄暗，安靜休臥。頭部貼氷囊，胸部施温濕布淹法。有時貼芥末。</p>
<p>問　對於各種病狀，應當怎樣？</p>
<p>答　發熱的時候，行發汗法。喝熱的飲料，間或用優奎寧。咳嗽的時候，行吸入法，含嗽法或服袪痰鎭咳劑。對於發疹時的皮膚癢感，用消毒的油類墜布。眼内用硼酸水洗滌，鼻内塗硼酸軟膏或用Mistcl點入。</p>
<p>問　麻疹病愈後，應當怎樣調攝？</p>
<p>答　等到熱度退盡後一星期，纔可起床。再經一星期可以出外。在恢復期中，切勿感寒，以防發生肺炎等症。</p>
<p>問　有什麽方法可以預防麻疹？</p>
<p>答　勿和已病的人接近（隔離），注射恢復期病人的血清是很有效的預防法。</p>

<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>雖然，我們要使普通的民衆對於醫學，都能瞭解其究竟，當然是辦不到的事。不要說是普通的民衆，就是智識界，甚至我們醫界自身的人們，也是不可能。我們所研究所求得的一點智識，也不過是目前科學界所公認的一極小部份。醫學中未知的東西，還是很多很多，簡直可以說，未知的醫學好似茫茫大海呢。這多多的無限量的未知醫學，還在那裏靜待着我們醫學界今後的研究與努力，去發現去探求。我們　要宣傳的醫學智識，是極極淺易的醫學常識，是處處實用待着，時刻應用得到的普遍常識，我們所以責無旁貸的要去負這個宣傳的任務，實在是因爲一般的民衆，對於這一點淺易而攸關生命的日常智識，都太缺乏了，太遠離了，太不注意了，太不識辜用了的緣故呀！所以在任何方面的中國社會，都感覺到急需乎醫學智識的宣傳灌輸，我們醫師難道就不該來應現實社會的需要、而擔負起這利羣濟世的嚴重任務嗎？</p>
<p>以上把醫師對於病痛疾苦的民衆的救治任務，和醫藥常識的宣傳任務，已經大要的說過了；現在來說另一個與上述一個任務具有同樣重要的工作任務，這個工作任務，就是反非科學醫的革命任務。所謂非科學醫，即是一般人們所稱呼的「舊醫」，就是。這所謂舊醫的名稱，我覺得是很恰當很公道的。然而一般舊醫界的人們聽見，當然是要加以否認的；即一般外界的民衆聽見，或者也難免要說是我們新醫界對於舊醫們的一種含有幾分訕笑口氣的稱呼。其實這是錯誤的：所謂舊醫，就是因爲他是過去時代的一種玄學醫術；他的全部理論，都是根據古代玄醫的論調學說，全是尊崇古人抄襲古人開倒車的復古論者。我們科學新醫的醫師們爲什麽要做這一層反對的工作呢？這是很明白的，就是因爲他現代醫學是自然科學一部分的應用科學，他是解除人類疾苦，保衞人體康健的東西。這在上面已曾說起過。他旣然是一種應用人體上的應用科學，不消說，我們對於人體的組織構造，生理狀態等等，都要預先有個愼密的觀察，精確的研究才是。現代的科學新醫，即是根據於這個對於人體經過長期間嚴密的觀察，精確的實地試騐，實地研究出來的一種學術。由此種的科學基礎而出發的病理藥理等等，才是可靠，者是無誤於人體康健的眞正醫學。舊醫在早時過去時代，也曾經古人的一番心血，一番苦工，觀察過，研究過，那個時光，也曾經出過一番風頭；大家也認他爲當時的中心理論。不過那時候古人的觀察，古人的研究，當然不能像現在的應用科學的方法。所以他雖然觀察，却不觀察得嚴密，雖然研究，却研究殊不精確；因此，他的一切理論，一切事實，以現在的科學眼光看起來，都是不合理，都是虛僞，都是臆想猜測，都是　羣說謊</p>

<p>— 幹</p>
<p>「人權論」是從鸚鵡開頭的。據說古時候有一隻高飛遠走的鸚哥兒·偶然又經過自己的山林，看見那裏大火，　就用翅膀蘸着些水灑在這山上；人家說牠那一點兒水怎麽救得熄這樣的大火，牠說：「我總算在這裏住過的，現在不得不盡點兒心，」（事出「櫟園書影」，見胡適「人權論集」序所引）。鸚鵡會救火，人權可以粉飾一下反動的統治。這是不會没有報酬的。胡博士到長沙去講演一次，何將軍就送了五千元程儀。價錢不算小，這「呌做」實騐主義。</p>
<p>但是，這火怎麽救，「在人權」論時期，（一九二九—三０年），還不十分明白，五千元一次的零賣價格做出來之後，就不同了。最近（今年二月二十一）字林西報登載胡博士的談話說：</p>
<p>任何一個政府都應當有保護自己而鎭壓那些危害自己的運動的權利、固然，政治犯也和其他罪犯一樣，應當得着法律的保障和合法的審判……</p>
<p>這就清楚得多了！這不是在說「政府權」了嗎？自然，博士的頭腦並不簡單，他不至於只說：「一隻手拿着寳劍，一隻手拿着經典」丨如什麽主義之類。他是說還應當拿着法律。</p>
<p>中國的邦忙文人，總有這一套祖傳秘訣，說什麽王道，仁政。你看孟夫子多麽幽默，他敎你離得殺猪的地方遠遠的，嘴裏還保持着不忍人之心，又有了仁義道千的名目。不但騙人，還騙了自己，眞所謂心守理得，實惠無窮。</p>
<p>詩曰：</p>
<p>文化班頭博士銜，人權抛却說主權，朝廷自古多屠戮，此理今憑實騐傳。人權王道兩翻新，爲感君恩奏聖明，虐政何妨援律例，殺人如草不聞聲。先生熟讀聖賢書，君子由來道不孤，千古同心有孟子，也敎肉食遠庖廚。能言鸚鵡毒於蛇，滴水微功漫自誇，好向侯門賣廉恥。五千一擲未爲奢。</p>

<p>没有清晨，也没有日暮；世界在他永遠是没有光明的。他不知道什麽是人快樂的表現，又什麽是人悲哀的流露；他眼前永遠是那樣的漆黑一團丨每天，彈着三絃琴，從這條巷裏走出來，又從别一條巷裏走進去。</p>
<p>這世界永遠不會對他發生同情，他從也不知道這世界上還有同情兩個字。每天。他聽到了門外有了行人的脚步聲，他就取了三絃琴，摸出門來、上各街各巷去作生命的掙扎，等到街上行人的脚步聲漸漸消散了，他就收了三絃琴，從各街各巷走出來，又摸進了自己的家門。</p>
<p>每天，他都彈着三絃琴，從這條巷裏走出來，又從别一條巷裏走進去。</p>
<p>琴絃一根一根在他的手指下跳動着，輕輕地埕出一聲聲的嘆息。他不知道爲什麽要走上這茫茫的旅途？不論是在清晨或是日暮，晴天或是雪朝，他彈着三絃琴只是走，只是在這茫茫的旅程上走着丨他非常困倦，想早點完結這黑暗的旅行，可是生活的鞭子沉重的抽來，不容他休息，他只得悄無聲息的抱着三絃琴向前走去。</p>
<p>他要什麽時候才能走出這黑暗的旅途呢？祗有天知道。</p>

<p>— 朱湘</p>
<p>官場現形記」裏所說的，候差委的　人去見上司，要預備下一筆門包的費用　，否則，連見面的希望都没有：這種情形，不知道現在還遺存於官場之内否，因爲我不曾作過官。一班的訪會者，儉省的，只須在傳達處遞入五厘錢，一張名片的費用。便只索取這五厘錢，丨無益於傳達處，正與紙錢錫箔一樣。</p>
<p>訪會最好是在事先約定時間，否則在名片去了，主人來了之間，必有一番的等候丨有的時候，即使是時間已經事先約定了，這一番的等候還是不免的。所以，我向一班訪會者建議、名片之外，隨身不要忘了帶一本書，「翟斯特斐爾德勛爵信牘集」LOARD　Chesterfield'sLetters最好。切不可帶那種看來這主人是不會喜歡的書，「嘗試集」，如主人是舊派，「聖經，」如主人是新派，「托洛茲基自傳，」如主人是「國民黨，」「三民主義，」如主人是「國家主義派；」主人如其自己便是一個作者，那便再好不過了······主人來了。他如其用手一揮，敬你的烟，你最好是撒一個白謊，說不會，即使几上是放着精雅的烟盒，或是「大砲台」的烟罐。熟人是會去自取烟捲的；生客、如其愚蠢，會在「大砲台」的烟罐内取出了一支丨「大英牌。」烟捲如其親手的遞到了你的面前，這時便要相機處置了；如其主人知道你是抽烟的，爲了禮貌，你便不得不抽，即使是「大英牌」；如其，天幸，他並不知道，你便可以也撒一個白謊，說不會···却不能忘記了再說一聲，多謝。</p>
<p>訪會的時候，錶是不能不帶的，不過，當了主人的面，你决不能去看牠。坐得時刻太短，又怕主人臆怪；坐得時刻太長，變相的逐客令又會使得你難堪。啊，訪會時的痛苦，去留的問題！</p>
<p>端茶送客，這是古禮；在新潮流的現代，古禮是廢除了，變相的逐客令是如何的下法，這便要看主人的聰明了。不說話；看時計；討論氣象；問來客的住址；等等。包車夫可以進來領工錢；至於門房、在這一點上，更是一個層出不窮的智囊。</p>
<p>於是你便出來了······趕快燃一支烟捲罷。抽烟的時候，你可以自慰：還好，主人並没有「不在家」。</p>
<h3 id="c203">巴黎留學生的住和食（續） <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 復生</p>
<p>食</p>
<p>拉丁區的小旅館，都是祇租房子不包伙食的。高高的住在天國裏的留學生，就是不出去上課的時候，爲着肚子，每天也得好幾次降臨　世。</p>
<p>最受留學生光顧的，要算那些定價　店。一份頂普通的定價餐，太大概包含一碟小食品（Hors.d.oeuvre）一碟肉或魚，一碟青菜，一碟點心或水菓，一小瓶葡萄酒或啤酒，一條飯巾，一幾塊麵包（麵包大都是可以儘量吃的）。樣數雖有規定，但菜却可　以隨客挑選。譬如肉類，有牛肉，豬肉，羊肉，兎肉等等；單是牛肉一項，又有炸牛排，紅燒牛肉等等，隨你挑選一樣。這種定價餐，烹調雖不見佳，但滋養料是很充足的，並且無論怎樣食量大的人，總都可以吃飽。當我初到巴黎時，這樣的定價餐，有三個多佛郎就可以吃到，而現在却非五個佛郎不行（約國弊一元）。</p>
<p>吃不憤法國菜，或是被牛排和馬鈴薯塞厭了，想換換口胃的，那麽，在第五區，到處都有中國飯店等着你。</p>
<p>一說中國飯店，這算是中國人唯一可以驕傲的事。無論日本人怎樣蠻横，怎樣瞧不起中國人，但他們一見到「支那料理」，總自然忍不住要涎埀三丈，讚不絶口。在巴黎也就和在東京一樣，中國人做别的生意都不行，祗有賣這五各年文明的結晶丨丨支那料理，却還站得脚住。</p>
<p>拉丁區一隅，現在已有中國飯店上十家之多。這些飯店，大部分都是很賺錢的。飯店老闆多半是一些參戰的華工，做菜本非他們的專業，可是因爲中國人大多數都有烹調的天才，所以這班「素人」弄出來的中國菜，在巴黎也居然能夠吸收許多異國的食客。安南學生和日本學生，成了這些中國飯店的常年顧客，固不必說；就是法國人和其他各國的人士也都很高興跑來玩玩中國筷子。其中尤「上海樓」一家，因爲開在巴黎大學隔壁的緣故，吸收外國學生最多。</p>
<p>在這些中國飯店吃一餐飯，如果點菜的話，單單一樣菜，連白飯在内，總得十佛郎左右；「定價飯」雖可便宜一點，但菜劣不堪下咽，且兩小碟的東西，食量稍大的人就不夠吃，實在不如法國人或别國人開的飯店裏面五六佛郎一頓的定價餐來得合算。</p>
<p>自從一九二九年起，因爲金價高漲的原故，巴黎的中國學生，大都窮困不堪，能夠餐餐上飯店吃飯的，實在很少。十之六七，都用一具酒精燈，在房間裏自己隨便煮點東西果腹。尤其是住在城外的，因爲吃飯不便（城外餐店通常比城内昂貴），十之九都是自炊。早兩年孫伏園君住在薔薇村的時候，也時常提着玻璃瓶出去買火酒；現在主編東方雜誌的胡愈之君，住在第五區某小旅館時，也曾度過自炊的生活。這都是現在國内的所謂名流。名流在巴黎的生活已經如是，其餘非名流的苦學生，更可想而知了。不過名流裏面究竟還有一二例外的，如像官僚化的藝術叛徒劉某，在巴黎的時候，却是天天挾着他的嬌妻愛子出入於「上海樓「」萬花樓」等酒店的。可是這究竟是例外。</p>
<h3 id="c204">黑女求神記（十九） <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 蕭伯訥作　宜閑譯</p>
<p>「只不過將我們交到吃人的奴隷驅使者和踐踏人的先生們手裏去罷了」黑女孩子說。「獅子和象同我們共有着土地。當他們吃着，踏着我儀身體的時候，他們　放着我們的靈魂。他們吃飽了，就不再要什麽了。但是什麽東西也不會滿足你們的貪心的。你們呌世世代代的我們拚命工作着，直至你們每個人都有多於我們一百個人吃得，用得的東西；可是你們還要强迫我們工作得愈益苦，愈益長久，而我們所得的衣食反愈益少。你們没有明白你們所謂足够的意義是什麽；又没有明白我們所謂不足的意義是什麽。我們没有錢來買你們販運進來的貨色了，你們便老是咕嚕着；你們的救濟辦法只不過是將錢給得我們更少。這一定是你們信奉僞神的緣故啦。你們是異敎徒，是野蠻人。你們旣不知道怎樣生活，又不讓别人生活。待到我尋到神的時候，我就有精神上的力量來破壞你們，來敎我同種的人們不要破壞自己了。」　　「看啊」！第一個女士呌道。「她惹得這班男人心亂了。我告訴過你們！她要遥樣的。她的」</p>
<p>那番煽動的廢話，他們用心聽着啦。看看他們的眼睛罷。那是有些危險的。如果你們男人没有一個動手呢，那我要一槍打死她了。」</p>
<p>於是那女士慌張起來，眞的拔手槍了。然而她還未使得手槍出皮匣子，黑女孩子却向她撲去，用她那心愛的「諾勃凱黎」只一擊結果了她的性命；便卽狂奔到森林裏去了。於是黑脚夫們不由　得非常開心了。</p>
<p>「、謝天謝地，她的脾氣變好了，」第一個先生說。「只一刹時，事情似乎有些不妙的樣子。」</p>
<p>現在是一切都好了。獨克透：你將怪可憐的菲次瓊茲小姐的小腦察看一下好不好。」</p>
<p>「我們所犯的錯誤，」博物學者說，「就在没有將我們的食物送一點給她。」</p>
<p>黑女孩子躱了許多時候，直至拿得穩没有人來追趕她了。她知道自己的是要受笞打的案子，又知道黑人被告對白人原告的什麽辯訴都是没有效力的。她没提防騎警；因爲那地方騎警很稀少。她又不願意儘管躱避那旅行團；她因爲這個方向和那個方向於自己的目的都一樣的緣故，便回轉去走她走過了的路，（因爲那旅行團走着她本來要走的路啦）到傍晚時候這纔覺得自己又在同術士談過天的那口井邊了。她在那里見到一個攤頭，擺着許多木頭，石膏，象牙的造像出賣；攤頭旁邊的地上横着一個大大的木頭十字架，那術士义着膝頭，張着兩臂躺在這上面。擺攤頭的人正在木頭上很迅速很純熟地雕着他的雕像。他們由一個漂亮的戴頭帕的亞拉伯紳士看望着，他腰帶上插一把彎刀，坐在井闌圈上，撚着他的鬍子。</p>
<p>「你爲什麽幹勾當的呢，朋友？」亞拉伯紳士說。「你知道這是破犯神給摩西的第二誡的。照理，我可以用彎刀斫死你；然而我却捱受着一輩子的苦難啦，爲的是一種精神上的軟弱使我不能從從容容地斫殺什麽動物，更不必說人了。你爲什麽幹這勾當的？」</p>
<p>「我要不餓死，另外還有什麽幹得呢？」術士說。「我是人們中間全被棄却的人，我的生活方法只有坐在這里，給這好心的藝術家充當模特兒罷了。我整天攤在這個十字架上，他給我後個鐘頭六班士。他自己呢，是將這種可笑模樣的我的造像出賣，靠此過活的。人們將我當作「死時的罪人」把玩着，因爲他們除了對於警務新聞以外，是什麽也不留心的。他造像的存貨，積得充足了，我呢，六辨士也積蓄到有成數了，我便休息一天，到各地方去，將好的勸告給予人們，將有益的眞理告訴人們。如果他們只聽信我的話呢，那他們就會儘幸福起來儘好起來的罷。然而他們却不肯相信我，除非我變戲法給他們看看，我變戲法的時候，他們丢給我的也只有銅子，間或呢，「鐵開」他們說我是好不奇怪的人，他們說世界上從未有過像我這樣的人啦；然而他們却還繼續做着愚人，惡心，和殘暴的人。這使我覺得神有時候是捨棄我的了。」</p>

<h3 id="c205">文言化的吳諺 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>純粹的吳諺存在於不識字的民衆口中，越是智　階級，所操的吳諺裏面含有文言的成分越多。</p>
<p>但是，不識字民衆的口中，間或也有文言化的吳谚，我把來冩在後面：</p>
<p>吳諺中用「之」字，這是文言化；如普通吳諺中的「一蓬之火」，「一墻之隔」，「一世之事」，這是不識字的都會說的。其他，「豈有此理」？「弗在乎此」，「弗成其局」，「鄭重其事」，······這一　的俗語，都是人人會說的；細細研究起來，句句都是文言化。</p>
<p>從前私塾盛行的時候，兒童在裏面呐喊的書本，這是任何人都耳熟能詳的；往往有不識一字的人，也會背得出兒童口中的讀物。爲這緣故，所以一部分的吳諺，受了兒童讀本化；譬如逃走了人，大家都會說：「桃之夭夭」：事近冒險，大家都會說：「顯顯令德」；還有什麽眇得「不亦樂乎」？吃得「焉哉乎也」；這些吳諺，現在還可以常常聽得，可見從前的兒童讀物，深印在一般民衆的腦蒂了；這是是文言化的吳諺。</p>
<p>吳諺中有一句矛盾話，便是有人聽得大哭小喊的聲音，也會說：哭得不亦樂乎？哭字和樂字用在一句，正是不堪細解。</p>
<h3 id="c206">當票 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 石顔也</p>
<p>丨上海的繁富是僅有表面的丨</p>
<p>當票，這是典質衣物的一張收據，上海是一個號稱黄金遍地之區，照理這當票和上海人是無緣的了。然而我見上海無論在熱閙區或僻靜地掛着大大的當字或押字店肆之多，就可證明這推理的不確。典質衣物，照理又是窮人的行爲，而事實上又不然，儘有衣服麗都之輩，皮夾裏也藏着一張或數張當票。</p>
<p>我曾這樣的妄想：假使我能取得一個絶大的權威，率領着數十百人，在熱閙的南京路上，立施一個緊急戒備令，呌自外灘至跑馬廳不論在車中的和步行的人都立着不准動，由我所領的許多人，專擇西裝革履的中服細軟的以及摩登女子們，在他們身上内内外外一個個袋中搜查，皮夾查到最深處的一層，那末定能有很多很多人鈔票没有一張，袁面没有一個，小銀圓亦或有或無，而祗有幾枚黄臭的銅圓。特别多的是當票，在不少人的皮夾的深深處發現出來，或竟會半數以上人身邊有這東西。這樣，我上面所說的衣服麗都者也有當票，便是以證明了。我得這個證明，我將如何欣喜？然而那時在稠人中被發現當票的，他的面部表情又將如何呢？</p>
<p>我這個妄想，也是有感而發的，因爲我的朋友中，有很多西裝革履，中服細軟，他們很像是資産階級，至少也不是一個窮人，乘上電車，終向頭等裏跑，實則他們囊中祗有幾枚車費，其餘的就是當票了。四時不斷的循環着，他們的衣服的循環着出入於長生庫中，而一個皮夾是專門買來做當票的保險庫。一個冬天的傍晚，我在一家質庫門前走過。門裏兩個白白凈凈穿了皮大衣的少婦走出，伊們走在我前面，没有留意我在後面。只聽見其中的一個說：好好的一條頭繩圍巾，祗當一塊半錢，現在的東西眞當不起錢了！這樣的漂亮人還入長生庫，而所質的又是冬季所需用的圍巾，那末伊春夏秋三季衣服的盡入質肆，已不言而喻；伊袋裏當票之多，看來也可以開個展覽會了。當票不專是窮人的所有物，我在我的朋友和那個女子已找到了確證。朋友！你們也見到這種人嗎？上海繁富是僅有表面的，我於這貌似富裕而身藏當票者之多而益信了。</p>

<p>「抗空救國」的聲浪，這幾天，像日本飛機飛得那麽高日本飛機下，像驚弓之鳥船的中國老百姓，老是伸長着脖子，等着看炸飛鷹，轟掖縣，焚成都的列位民族英雄，爭先恐後出關去「航空救國」。「不抵抗」已成陳跡。「長期抵抗」，此路不通。「空談救國，無濟於事」。「武力擔抗」，少不了飛機。提倡航空，確是救國要圖，「愛國有心，救亡無術」連嘴都愛國的同胞，在這千載一時，萬年一刻的緊要關頭，怎敢不感激涕零，從腰包裏掏出白花花的大洋錢，贊助一下「航空救國」的百年大計。「航空救國」這錦囊妙計，果然可使敵人嗁矮下去三寸。可是一年半載之間，大批飛機已購就了，一時要訓練就大批駕駛術純熟的飛機師，倒也不是輕易平凡的事。待到萬事齊備，開往熱河，一鼓而收復失地，雖然一方面「航空救國」，一方面不放棄「長期抵抗」，儘慢慢地抱佛脚，可是在敵機下面，地窖子裏伸長着脖子期待着的中國老百姓，早已一堆一堆的陳列於扶桑三島的枯魚之肆了依在下的愚見，與其「航空救國」，還不如「高射砲救國」來得千穩萬妥，簡便易行。高射砲這東西，一運到就可使用，至少可免用「航空救國」方法時招請或訓練駕駛員的麻煩。每一個軍隊裏，配上幾尊高射砲。一架敵機來，就打它一個　子翻身。十架來，就打它十個機身墮地。檢打得無可收拾的敵機，陳列起來，像日本人把「天下第一關」匾額，運往東京，留爲紀念。檢好些的，修理一下，「航空救國」。「高射砲救國」，分明是孔明借箭，豈不上算。</p>

<p>天災人禍，把整個的中國。掩入於絶對不景氣的狀態之中，說天災罷，水災旱災，流離了多少貧苦的民衆，葬送了無數親愛的同胞，其種種姜慘情景，書不勝書，眞是令人悲痛萬分，欲哭無涙！</p>
<p>可是一般富人，儘自享樂，無動於中，一旦自己逢着，有了錢可向别處逃走，好像挖腰包捐助他人，不是份内的事，其坐視他人之淪亡，雖謂其無心肝，亦無不可。</p>
<p>不僅如此，更有些人借「振欵」之名，以塞其私囊，　置民命於不顧，其用心之毒，直無過於蛇蝎。</p>
<p>昨往觀明星公司出品「狂流」試片，覺得上述那種痛心現象，已爲　盡行暴露其情節，述一劣紳之不顧民生，使人怒髮衝冠，其布景之逼眞，傷心怵目，有如身臨其境，凡吾同胞。值得一看。</p>

<p>江江氏道：我們娘兒倆，一天到晚，縮在屋子裏，悶得發慌，二爺來了，我們也可以談談。甘二爺道：你們這兒快有街坊搬來了，往後就熱閙了。江氏皺了眉道：往後就熱閙了嗎？我正在這裏發愁呢，人家是當軍官的，我們是小住家的，和人家住在一處，恐怕有些說不來。甘二爺笑道：這樣說起來，你們倒有些傲骨　嶒呢。可是說起來，我也是個小小的官僚，應該你們對我也是不歡迎的了。老姑娘站在一邊只是微笑着，没有說甚麽，江氏連忙揷言道：那是甚麽話，像二爺這樣的人，我們都要說不來，甚麽樣的人。才能夠說得來呢？說着話時，老姑娘已經在甘二爺手上接過包袱去。也不打開來看，就放到坑頭邊一隻破箱子裏去。甘二爺笑道：老姑娘，你也不將布量一量嗎？若是不夠的話，我要你作起一件衣服來，你可得賠我的料子。老姑娘笑道：你二爺也不是作衣他捨不得一二尺料子的人，縱然少一二尺料子。我告地訴二爺，二爺也會相信，不能說是我們把料子落下來了。甘二爺聽到人家說出這種知己之言來，也不由得從心窩裏笑將出來。只因楊家是個舊式人家，有江氏在當面，不能因爲人家窮了，自己就隨便的說笑話，所以還是十二分的鄭重，只微微一笑，便走出外邊屋子來。他走出外邊屋子時，老姑娘也立刻向伊母親道：吃晚飯還没有菜，我要上街去買兩塊南豆腐來吃。說着，也隨着甘二爺後面，跟了出來。到了大門口，便笑道：二爺你不是想喝小米粥嗎？甘二爺道：可不是，你怎麽知道？老姑娘道：今天上午，瞧見你家聽差拿了個大瓦罐子由街上跑回來，他告訴我，我想喝這個，我們家晚上熬的是進個，　回頭呌聽差拿缽罐子到我家來舀罷。甘二爺笑道：阿彌陀佛！你娘兒倆極省儉的，我倒要分你們吃的。老姑娘道：一升小米，要煑一大鍋粥呢。我們家就是再窮，拿一鍋小米粥送人，總還送得起。甘二爺聽了笑道：那我一定叨擾，就笑着去了。老姑娘得了這句話，倒不買豆腐，在街買了紅豆小米回來，用大瓦缽子裝着，放到火上來熬。江氏道：你爲甚麽熬這一大鍋小米粥。打算吃個三天三晚嗎？老姑娘却並不說甚麽，只是抿了嘴微笑着（三）</p>

<p>一向被舊禮敎遮掩着的婦女，始終守着「金人三緘」！間或有許多是「上疏班昭」，「詠絮謝女，」的才女，在男人們眼光裏看來似乎都是些「不祥之物」！</p>
<p>直到民初提倡婦女解放以後，纔知道女子與男子應有平等的地位，同樣的言論自由。在民三，各書局都出版許多關於婦女的雜誌，中華書局出版「中華婦女界」，商務出版「婦女雜誌」，其他有一些什麽「女子雜誌」，「婦女時報」，煉石女士在日本主編了「中國新女界雜誌」，一時到也洋洋大觀到後來開明書店出版了「新女性」，良友書局出版「今代婦女」，像北平，天津，漢口，杭州等處也有出版女子日報的，婦女週報的，婦女導報的，婦女旬刋的，祇可惜多半都是「紅顔薄命」，始終没有一個能得着永久的存在。</p>
<p>就像商務在一二八以後，達「婦婦雜誌」都不再復刋了，說起來尤其是痛心得很！</p>
<p>似乎從前在一般子主編的小報雜誌上，都載一些妓女和女伶的照片，現在却趨合時代的潮流，用女學生做幌子，這絶對不能用女學生高尚的人格，去和妓女相比，似乎我們做女學生的，應當提出抗議，嚴厲拒絶，不許别人去刋載。這並不能算是一種出風頭的表示呵！</p>
<p>尤其是事案上，這許多報紙雜誌，根本就没有婦女自由的言論，旣稱是婦女刋物，縱使不必盡是女子去執筆，也應當討論些關於婦女的切身問題，做一種改良家庭社會的先聲。</p>
<p>婦女們更不應當做「人間的傀儡」「社會上的木偶」！</p>

<p>上美髮館洗頭燙頭髮。」我們常聽見姊妹們這樣說。自己在家裏總洗不好，也燙不好，似乎在美髮館裏修飾之後，便能出落得和天仙一般的美麗！其中有一些小小的研究。</p>
<p>有一些人在不曾塗過洗頭水之前，便行將頭髮浸在水裏了。温和的水内還加了些硼砂。不過硼砂對於柔軟而光亮的頭髮是適宜的，對於澀而細長的頭髮却不合適，</p>
<p>洗頭髮須經過兩次抹肥皂沬的手續，而且每一次都要在水裏漂洗乾淨。「漂洗」不過是洗去一切灰塵短頭髮及頭皮屑油膩之類。</p>
<p>經過兩次漂洗後，可用半只檸檬汁滲和一英兩「輕氣化銹」Ｈydrogen　peroxide融合在熱水裏，用它來淋頭髮。這種方法是對於各種顔色的頭髮都適用，目的是防止頭髮不會變成黯然無光，不過我們黑色頭髮的人應用、「紫蘇茶和洋醋」Ｓage　Tea　And　Vinegar來得相宜。</p>
<p>燙頭髮我以爲「水燙」比火酒燙電燙都好，可以免去損傷美麗的頭髮。</p>
<p>要是水燙便不能不採用美髮漿Ｈair　Waving　Lotion　o若是在美髮漿裏加少許鹻alkali，結果一定還要圓滿。</p>
<p>市上購置美髮漿價錢太貴，這裏有一個簡單的自製方法：</p>
<p>鉀炭酸鹽ｐOTASSIUM　carbonte</p>
<p>半茶匙</p>
<p>玟瑰水Ｒose　Water四英兩</p>
<p>用鉀炭鹽投在玟瑰水内，摇着瓶子讓它完全化合。</p>
<p>水燙另有一種「鬆髮梳」，Ｗater　Waving　Comb市上出賣的是英國貨，但是仿製也簡單而容易得很。</p>
<p>頭髮鬆成波紋式的結果，可以保存到一兩星期之久。</p>

<p>— 鳳梧</p>
<p>以「金元王國」稱於世之美利堅，不幸其金融界發生恐慌，波及全國。吾人懸崖觀火，方　其黄金之豐富，而乃有此提存之風潮，豈眞黄金無靈不罷能　厄者耶？</p>
<p>此次風潮發生於世界第一汽車業製造處之　芝根州第答羅城之聨合監護信托公司，該公司因現欵不敷應付存户提欵及發財政善後社之信欵息金，風聲外播，人心皇皇，存户　紛紛提欵。密芝根州州長康姆司第克遂於二月十三日夜間　同　地銀行界　夜會商，並徵得商部與財部同意，卽以全州財政緊急之理由，下令自十四日起至廿一日止，在此期内，各銀行與信托公司及財政機關均停業，八天。於是全州四百二十家州銀行一百二十家國銀行及　　交易所均停業。亦美國經濟衰落以來最大之經濟風潮，而爲全世界金融界所注目者也。</p>
<p>自事變發生後，　國各地銀行，紛紛以現欵交由火車或飛機運往接濟，數在四千萬至五千萬之　。福特公司並納克列斯勒與通用汽車兩公司之勸告，接濟聨合監議信托公司現欵二千萬元，人氣恐慌爲之大减。州長康氏以此次風潮之主因，大半由於小存户恐慌心理所造成，故言一俟人民皆覽其存欵安全無虞後，卽可撤銷停付令。至十七日密州參議院通過决議案，宣布緊急狀態，並授權州長得展貴銀行停付期限，以調節提欵。所有停止付現辦法，並推行及於自來火電氣電話之帳欵，即市政局其工工資，亦　爲現金半付支票。定二十一日滿期，州長下令各銀行准於廿二日開市，但祗准提取存欵百分之五。一面由福特父子接管第一國銀行及聨合監護信托公司，如以改組。惟第一國銀行因紐約銀行拒絶福特之援助改組計劃仍依限制提存辦法，照舊經營。至信託公司則由福特組織製造業國銀行接收其財産。聞共出資八百二十五萬金元。</p>
<p>當風潮之初起也，全美震動，紐約及各大城證劵交易所市價立時狂跌，倫敦市場上美金交易絶爲旺盛，尤甚近遠期市價相差頗鉅，每磅竟至二分半，故如美國銀行當　買進三個月期，同時售出近期，獲利甫操左劵。參議院並懐疑於財産善後社之措置，往往於銀行將　　貸以巨欵，而有要求澈底調查該公司内容之舉。</p>
<p>自密芝根州提存風潮作，雖百方維持，漸造平息。然以限制提存之結果，各方人心爲之戒懼，不久，竟蔓延及於美國東部之馬利蘭州。亦發生提存風潮，一星期中，祗巴的馬爾一處已達一千三百萬元上下雖與該州五萬萬元存欵，之比較，尚　不鉅，但星期五一日竟揚提六百萬元，不無使人驚訝，及至二月二十四日上午，更有擠提之象，且有兩銀行，將受擠而　。州長李齊乃召集本州六大銀行緊急會議，决定本州境内各銀行暫行休業三日，以保持存户反銀行之利益。計停業之銀行，二百零五家。而據州長宣稱，本州各銀行基礎皆甚穩固，僅有數家，不能應付空然發生之擠提風潮而已。</p>
<p>馬利蘭州之巴的馬爾城與華盛頓相距僅四十哩，兩地金融界關係素絶密切，自得此訊，大爲震動，一般遂視爲美國銀行全部不穩健狀態之表現。並以美國金融善後社本有救濟此種局勢之職權，而今不爲救濟，任令停業，是否爲有關係各銀行未能供給該公司所需借欵担保品之故，不無致其責備之意。該州議會本有限制銀行存户未先通知之提欵數目議案，至此則迅速通過，以期實行。無如局勢已成，迄難挽救，全國危疑，無術消弭，空前之金融恐慌，相激相盪，而不可收拾矣。</p>
<p>美國人民，自聞密芝根馬利蘭兩州發生提存及停業後。對於銀行之信任心，大爲動摇，小存户紛向銀行提取儲蓄存欵。各州亦皆討論授州長宣布銀行停業之權，以圖减輕雙方　　之損失。故二十六日之一日中，有二十州立法議會集議此事。印第安那州阿千薩斯州與威斯感　州之州長，皆簽定於必要時宣布停付之議案，同時紐約及　傑　等五州亦增加州長　助銀行維持營業與促成改良之權力，各銀行又自相防範，如承千薩斯州有銀行四家，存欵五百萬元，併於國内商業銀行與信托公司。夭海胡州以形勢不利，廿七廿有十八家銀行，共有存欵八萬一千五百萬元，宣告停付，台敦Ｄayton參議會召集緊急會議，即宣布銀行停業。但經該州立法議會通過准銀行於緊急時限制存户提欵，以免發生擠提風潮，但必須得本州銀行委員會同意，於是台敦，阿克朗，里瑪，克里扶蘭等布鎭之銀行，於限制提欵辦法下開市營業，本雲凡尼亞州立法議會亦准銀行自行酌定限制提欵，毋須得本州之同意。</p>
<p>事雖如是，然而人心已虛，蔓延愈甚，逐漸而侵入中部波及西部矣。沃海胡州之南之　德凱州騰尼斯州各銀行卽於三月一日自動停業五天。加里福尼亞，路易西亞那，鄂克拉胡馬，米西西比諸州均先後宣告休業，有則限制提存。至三月二日宣布銀行休業者已有十八州，受停付影響者，逾五千萬人。各州宣布銀行休業限制提存續出，及至三月三日銀行散市之後，素以金融總匯著稱之紐約，伊里諾亞兩州亦不免宣告銀行休業。哥倫布亞區則由美國國會於三月三日通過議案，以無限之權力，授予總統與通貨管理員管理哥倫比亞區存欵收提事，所以保全首都金融之樞紐。恐慌及於全國，卽此三日之一日間，美國因金融風潮所受之損失，，竟達一萬一千六百萬元，宣布休業或限制提存之銀行，已達三千家。茲據各通訊社電訊所　，將美國各州銀行之應付提存辦法，彙列一表，以資參考，惟各電訊簡略不詳，漏漏誤所在不免，還祈諒之，惟天致已盡於此矣。（截至三月四日電訊爲止）</p>

<p>美政府於此屆風潮之處置，其先卽密芝根州提存之時，有資助清理銀行跌價　産辦法之草擬。及馬利蘭州繼起擠提，參衆兩院將顧順士之緊急法案予以通過，該案卽准國銀行於　融緊急時接濟用銀行。又授　通貨管理員對於美國六千餘家銀行所有存欵一七、０００、０００，０００元許加以有限制之提取一案，亦經胡佛總統核准成爲法律案。案爲授與通貨　　員以　　月爲限，期滿後，如得總統與財政部長之同　得繼續之，　以臨時感　之權，授奥　貨管理員，但各州對於州立銀行早有此權。又於三月一日國會以二０七票對二六　通過確産法案，移送總統簽字，該案許多債務人請准法庭後，展緩還債，免致確産，其時風潮已波及全國。四日又公有現已限制提現者之銀行，凡需欵孔殷，而有充分擔保品可得金融善後　之財力接濟。（金融善後社，所規定借欵須有充分擔保一層，頗使金融界中人不明其眞意，各銀行果有充分擔保品，則决不致感受羅致借欵之困難。　料金融　後　　　　可通融辦理，否則許多銀行　永　　該社覓得借欵之機會。）胡佛總統本有令新國會於三月二十日召築特别會議，討論　　美國内銀行業危機之緊急法案，而衆院銀行委員會已準備集會考慮立法案，參議　主張設立　政儲金，並授權新總統與通貨管理員採行其　　必其以保障存歎之任　辦法，騰尼斯州清算所現製定一種方法，令各銀行各自發行券，其數目一元至二十一元不　，庶存户可提取消多而銀行亦可應付其義務，甚至謂胡羅兩總統會談之結果，有廢除金付欵或禁止現金出口之猪測辭。及羅斯福就職之後，卽向全國人民，發表宣告，略爲深爲應付舉　恐慌計，將要求議會，界以全權，一如　時，又謂渠旦夕　，卽將召集職會、開非常會議云云，</p>
<p>０００００００００</p>
<p>此次提存風潮所生之影響，其在美國國内者，美國金錢，因存户之恐慌，及證　紛向加　拿大移存，月初之一二日内，已有千百萬元，致加幣漲起二分，勢尚未殺，蓋有錢者不敢存欵於其本國，深恐成爲呆資，據聨邦準備銀行理事會發表之每月報告書，略謂美國貨幣，一星期來，增加一萬三千四百萬元，已達流通額之最高限度，又最近三星期來抽提存欵數額之多，爲前此所未見，現金準備額，本星期内已滅少一萬一千六百萬元，私人多半提取存欵，尤以紐約爲甚，該處各銀行存欵總額，已由四萬四百萬圓減至二萬七千八百萬云元云。最近所有匯兌證劵及棉花市塲亦皆休業，百業停頓，影響可謂巨大矣。</p>
<p>其在國外，當密芝根州風潮初起時，曾有一態恐慌，不久卽歸平靜。但至三月四日海外形勢頓非　比，倫敦銀行票據交換所委員會决定暫停一切外匯交易，又據歐洲各大埠消息，進止外匯交易者漸衆。丹京外匯交易祗英鎊一種，巴黎市塲美匯無市，銀行不付美銀行支票。羅馬曾停止美匯交易兩小時，意大利國家銀行電紐約各行將所有存欵改作黄金記帳，蓋恐美國或將禁金出口，而蹈英國放棄金本位時之覆轍也。</p>
<p>００００００</p>
<p>美國此次金融風潮之劇烈究爲何故發生，即美之銀行專家亦不能確知。最初雖起於第答羅城，但當他埠發生時，該處已告平靜。及激盪所屆，至二月二十五日至二十八日間，遂造成今日全國銀行停頓之局面。無他，發動之始難微，而民衆自聞發生風潮之銀行有停業之舉，深恐累及，於是紛向銀行提取存欵，以防不測，存户之恐慌心理愈熾，銀行之危險性愈大，銀行乃至無法應付，而出於停業。甲地乙地之銀行休業，丙地丁地之存户更慌。無不澈於一時之利念，而不念銀行擠倒後之損失，難有政府宣言警察警告，俱不能阻存户提欵之心，蓋此時之存户心理，已失常態，惟恐後　而不得存欵耳。此不僅銀行爲然，卽如基礎穩固之公司行號，亦有時爲現金周轉不靈，同爲銀行錢莊所逼倒。銀行收受存欵，除提相當現欵作準備外，餘皆周轉於工商實業，决無死藏多數現欵之理，故如存户紛起提欵，超出於其平常準備之外，銀行自必難以應付，其勢不能向客家立時收回其放欵耳。假如一銀行提存，他銀行尚可接濟之，今美國多數銀行提存，惟有暫時休業之一法。風聲鶴涙，草不皆兵，正見人心之恐慌，然星星之火，可以憭原，亦見禍常忽於所微者也。</p>
<p>言其遠因，仍不外世界經濟衰落之影響。蓋自各國多數放棄金本位後，美國仍　持原狀。因此對外貿易顯見不利。内部則生産過剩。物價下跌，百業凋零，失業增加，民生艱困。卽如棉價减至三年前之四分之一，小麥及猪肉减至三分之一，致無論農工商業皆感受此嚴重影響。如欲提高國内物價及恢復輸出貿易，在波拉氏主張，則以川戰債問題之解决（一日不解决，」日不　，美國金融頓减量額）（二）通貨膨脹，以提高物價。（三）削减政費（美國政費擴大，致有每分鐘不數二千三百元及每人每年工作四月以奉政府之說）（四）變動貨幣價值，確立金銀復本位制，提高銀價，整理民間債以爲消弭恐慌之政策。然此爲共和釁所不喜，胡佛總統於卸任告别演說中，有云，美國在經濟方面，已抵岔路口。第一途各國合作，祗除世界貿易之障壁，與提高物價之阻礙，此爲全世界立時可以救濟農業，與减少失業之途徑。第二途：美國將恃其地大物博，足以自給，增加關稅。其第三途則爲膨脹頭通貨，放棄金本位，入於世界經濟戰爭，但其結果，必致人已兩敗完全破壞。但自此次民主黨秉政，金融業復發生空前之恐慌，胡佛之言，恐將發生變動矣。</p>
<p>美國銀行受前述之影響，所受理之貨物，所有之財産，或以經濟不充，或爲物價低落而貶值，因此而失存户之信任，提存風潮之來，蓋淵源於此。來日何如，且觀其後。二十二年三月四日</p>
<h3 id="c214">國幣型式評 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 潘士浩</p>
<p>國幣必具備相當之型式，型式者，花紋，直後·重量·成然之德　也。我國國幣之直徑·重量·成色，均明定於法律。花紋則徐大清銀幣則例外，均以敎令定之。考此項花紋，本富有研究之價值，故有所謂花紋學（Ｈeraldfytty）者出焉。凡當時政治之制度，宗敎之變　，美　之盛衰，風俗之　薄，文物工藝之隆替等一切國民性之表現，均可於此覘之。雖曰小技，而一國之榮辱系之矣。</p>
<p>我國國幣之花紋，自清代之龍，民三之袁像，國民政府之開國紀念幣，以迄中央造幣廠近日新宣布之斷幣，蓋已數經變　矣。究竟此次新型式爲進步乎？爲退步乎？爲合理乎？爲背理乎？請分别批評之。</p>
<p>（一）　造地名之生滅，國幣者，全國通用之貨幣也，除標明國名外，不得另標　造地名，此各國之通則也。清代幣廠林立，改出多門，幣面各標名其　造之省名。實一缺點也。民初袁像幣首革此弊，新國幣因之。此爲進步之點一。</p>
<p>（二）重量及此價之生滅，國幣之重量及相互　之比價，各國均　諸法律。幣　遵之以鼓　，國民　之以授受，初　　諸聖式之必要也。清代各幣，均　此缺點，　　理習慣之遺　。民國以來，頗能革除，傳　式上免去無謂之雜格，此爲進步之點二。</p>
<p>（三）洋文之生　　國幣　貿易貨幣不同。國幣者，國幣之代表也，非本國文字不載。貿易幣則專爲謀貿易之便利，乃可以洋文記載。清代當張之洞氏奏准開鑄銀元之初，意在抵制墨西哥銀元，並用　文洋文，以便與外洋交易。蓋卽貿易幣耳。實則華洋授受，仍用秤量。在國際　，銀元乃一　生銀，雖載洋文，無　實際也。其後各省紛紛開鑄，銀元之國幣資格，明定於　　銀幣則例，而型式之有洋文也如故。袁像幣獨革此弊，不可謂非一絶大進步。國民政府之開國紀念幣，則復用洋文。雖曰開國紀念幣不同凡幣，意在寫示中外。而國幣之雜用外國文字，　　有點　　。此次　式國幣，有鑒及此，將洋文一概屏棄，此爲進步之點三·（四）正面花紋之優劣，型式如上述三點之生滅外，其花紋復有足言者。新國幣正面爲孫中山先生側面肖像，上篆「中華民國二十一年」數字國莊嚴堂皇，絶合國體。蓋以國家政策論，以開。歷史論，以國民性之好尚論，此正面肖像，頗足以代表之也。以視富有迷信思想之　致，與美不脫專制　皇思想之袁像，相差不可以道里計矣。此爲進步之點　。</p>
<p>考貨幣型式上之肖像，大致爲理想的，如美國之用自由女神是也。自亞歷山大自用其肖像於幣面，乃開型式上用當代責人肖像之創例。然實不足爲訓。袁世凱以共和國之元首，而龔用專制帝皇之「朕卽國家」思想，欲以代表個人者代表國家，斯尤惑矣。惟孫中山先生爲開國之先動，又爲三民主義之先哲。凡知中國者，莫不知有孫先生。凡爲中國國民者，莫不崇拜孫先生。同一用以幣面，以爲國幣之型式。其其於國體上之損益，及影響於國民心理之優劣，則不可同日而語矣。</p>
<p>（五）皮面花紋之優劣　新國幣之反面花紋，爲晨旭初升，一船揚　　進，海匯高　其上，而兩旁分書「　」圓二字。生動而富有朝氣，頗合發揚進取之意。當此國難重重，内憂外患之秋，用之甚爲合理。考現開國紀念幣反面有嘉禾之花紋，袁像幣反面，亦有嘉禾。我國以　立國，嘉禾又爲農事上之禎祥，用之本無不　。但以生動進取言，則當推此次新幣。誠使國人觀感之餘，能奮發自强，一洗老大迂滯之　，此國弊眞足代表現代之國民性矣。此其進步之點五。</p>
<p>綜以上之批評而言，新國幣之型式，並無雜格無用花紋文字。其所有者，頗能代表國體，發揚國民性。文字除標明國名年代及幣制上之數量外，不妄費一字。花樣除前述合理各點外。毫無支離破碎之弊。如開國紀念幣，本可謂進步的型色矣，而反面有洋文，正面二旁，有　疣之花朶。新國幣　之，　有進步。設計者之巧思，應值得我人之感謝也。</p>
<p>型式中之花紋　矣，而廳造上必須認　，始可以防消磨僞造。用重量。成色必須按期爲公開的化騐，始可以堅國幣之信用。望造幣當局，加之意滙。</p>

<p>空太多籌　感缺</p>
<p>多期不動大漲兩日</p>
<p>上週二月二十七日至三月四日、華商證劵交易所公債市塲、二月二十七爲辦理二月　　貨交割、停市一天、市上祗做五日交易、初刻盤旋略　、繼則大漲兩日、終則　爲回跌、按　河戰　、連日不利、平津謡言、　　日緊、在此外侮方急、事態十分　重時、普通心理、咸以爲償　市價必將大跌、大都觀念、集中一對、放空者乃日益增加、多　方面、如浮而不實、則早將動摇、交割以後、仍無出　、乃知資本家實爲中堅份子、空願因無希望而抵補、故外　市價大漲似與時局　勢背　而聽、實則初非　然也、茲將本週五日逐日趨勢、分列於後、</p>
<p>（週二）爲交割後市一日、市上有將債劵基金撥出二成、以爲戰費之用、散户紛紛放空、大户乘低收進、市價略疲三五角、并本大跌、已出空方意料之外、</p>
<p>（週三）日人攻擊天津之說、愈見緊張、外行放空更甚、市價自早至暮、雖屬疲軟、終以供求均衡、結果祇小三四角、鹽稅并上漲二角、此日情形、檯面空頭、漸漸轉向、已料其空頭擁擠、勢將崩潰、因攻津之說、并未實現、</p>
<p>（週四）北帮空頭見機最早、在戰事危急、風聲鶴唳時、一意抵補、市價穩步上騰、散户空頭、乃處於進退維谷、</p>
<p>（週五）突有日内瓦我國三代表辭職之說、散户之機警者、趁勢補空、市價跌而復漲、北帮買進尢湧、結果又漲一元、</p>
<p>（週六）因市價已高、引起實貨之抛賣、故早盤　仍一漲、入後即不能振作、多頭且有得利結出者、乃起回風、稍跌七八角、</p>
<p>綜觀一週經過、多頭得利、其趨漲之王要原因、爲散户空頭太多、大户多頭不動、市上籌　、因至缺乏、故無怪其與時局情勢爲反比例也、一週結果、比前週續漲數角至一元餘、成交總數爲三千零十七萬五千元、茲將其高低漲跌、列表如後、</p>

<p>試騐期中　據郭氏云、本廠雖已開鑄、因尙在試騐期内、故每日能出幣數、亦未能確定、其原因有二點、（一）以所需器具如模型等、向多購自國外、現在廠内、擬自已研究製造、（二）所有工人、多係新招、對於製幣工作、均非素習、不經若干之時期、實地訓練、萬難熟諳、所以現在雖已開鑄、有上述兩種原因、而未能作爲正式、即前日宋院長來廠視察、亦以爲非經六月之試騐不可、</p>
<p>不敷開支　現在製幣之生銀、完全由中銀行交付、而所鑄銀幣、亦全係代中央所造、廠中祗得一手續費而已、故將來非日出三十萬元、方可不蝕本、照余希望、嗣後能逐步改造、增造銀幣、以代替銅元、及製造各種證章、方能支持廠内開支、不使虧本、但事非容易、一時尙不能辦到也云云、</p>

<p>— 吾</p>
<p>多麽奇特的消息，日本關東又大地震了，我猜得準，定有許多觀音菩薩的信士弟子，因此而合十日，「天網恢恢，疏而不漏，這是殺人越貨的果報呀·」另有一等人則大歡喜，理由是這一來日本可大傷原氣，從此恐怕不能一味蠻幹而馬上打到平津吧？也許進攻熱河的軍事行動馬上就會停止哩，至於深明大義的爲國爲民者諸公，他們該是怎樣想法，我們到不能猜得準確，因爲「以小人之心度君子之德，」究竟是很容易「失之毫厘差以千里」的，所以還是不說爲妙，但是爲了「郭睦邦交」起見，也許會動員全國人民，節衣縮食而賑濟一番的何况當前年咱們全國水災的時候，日本天皇還「佈施」了好幾萬國帑，於是以一「禮尚往來」爲原則，我們回敬多少，也是很正大堂皇的，而且幾年以前的關東震災，我國也曾經賑濟不少，這一次，當然不可例外，况且現在的中日國交，的確已到了似乎快要斷絶的時候，我們如能藉此而情誼動人，雖然不見得馬上實現中日聨盟，但最少也可以不必興兵動馬吧？因爲日帝國主義不見得就完全喪絶良心，而還不停止軍事行動，</p>
<p>各人都有各人的說法，各人都有各人的理由，頭頭是道，所以天下的事。也就不能以常軌而論。</p>
<p>但是就目前的形式而言，時局是的確緊張，雖然報紙上總是以大字標題，極顯眼目的登載着，「因戰略關係縮短戰線」，或「佈置新隊綫」最巧妙的題目是「誘敵深入」，名目非常好聽，非常有希望，使大家心領神會，心照不宣，以圖鼓勵民氣，可是這民氣事實上鼓勵到何等程度呢？最明顯的便是商店的玻璃窗上。多半貼上了「航空救國」四個大字，所以眞正没有閒錢來捐助飛機的究竟免不了悲憤塡膺，爲的是他們所能夠拿出的只有熱血和頭顱，但是民衆武裝，事實上難於辦到，所以在呼天愴地之餘，所能做到僅是求天老爺保佑了，現在天是「有求必應」了，居然日本又有震災，至於另一等人希望日本因震災而中止侵略，因而自己樂得休息休息，等到「十年生集，十年敎訓」之後。再來比比高低，對於這種人，我們很可打他兩板屁股的吧，</p>
<p>然而正經的一句話，是日本地震與否，和我們全無關係，日帝國主義的侵略的繼續，便是我們反帝戰爭的繼續，廣大的民衆團結起來，在反帝的立塲上與强盜們奮鬭到底，</p>
<p>更正　日前「松岡爲甚不自殺」一文中，後面有「只有自救」一語，誤爲「只有自殺，」特此更正。</p>

<p>— 芳心</p>
<p>（一）十四個孩子</p>
<p>王先生的家，在一條骯髒的弄堂裏。房子是二上二下的中國式的。那屋子裏除了王先生的之家之外，還有客堂樓上的張家，亭子間裏的黄家，廂房裏的薛家，那小小的二上二下房子内，一共住了四家，而每一家有二三個或三四個小孩子的。所以到王先生的家裏去，一進門就是許多小孩子。他們有時洵氣，有時相打，把那小小的一個客堂，閙得烏烟瘴氣。他們一共是十四個，七個男。七個女，說也奇怪，男女恰恰各占半數。那十四個孩子的來源是這着的：客堂樓上的張家一男二女，亭子間裏的黄家二男二女，廂房裏的薛家，二男一女，王先生二女二女。</p>
<p>（二）一只半凳</p>
<p>王先生佔據了那屋子的樓上一間廂房，長約二丈，闊約七八尺，說大不大，說小不小，王先生和一個老婆四個孩子住着，還過得去，不過王先生家的凳子，實在太少了，數一數，只有一只半。這如何說法？原來除王先生坐着寫字的那只凳子之外，只有一只破了的長凳了。那長凳本來是有四只脚的，但現在只剩了二只脚，不知給誰弄壞了。這只長凳由四只脚而變爲二只脚，只可說它是半只了。所以王先生之家裏，只有一只半凳。</p>
<p>（三）包羅萬象</p>
<p>王先生的家裏，凳子雖少，其餘的東西倒很多：牀一共有二只，檯子也有二只，其餘風爐，洋燈，油瓶，茶杯，茶壺，等等、可說是記不完的。因此那一間王先生的家，包括的着實不少。那裏有牀，他們臥的，那可稱之爲臥室；有碗廚，吃飯的筷等，他們吃飯也在那裏，那可稱之爲膳室；王先生坐在那僅有的一只完全的凳子上寫字，看報，讀書，那可謂之書室；他們燒菜煑飯也在那裏，那是廚房了；夏天他們又在那裏洗澡，那是浴室了；他們一只牀的背後，有便桶，那是大小便處了。王先生的一義廂房的家，包括了臥室，勝室，書室，廚房，浴室，大小便處，眞可稱它一句包羅萬象啊。</p>

<p>「聽說：這位小姐的聘金三千元還嫌太少不肯出閣，後來加了一千元才坐轎的呢，」</p>
<p>是啊！她做了三年小學敎師，一腔摩登思想，自然把二十世紀的哲學讀得很爛熟了：你猜，她的丈夫是個怎樣的人物？」</p>
<p>大學畢業生，西裝少年？」</p>
<p>「你這些理想哲學早落伍了！誰不會想到她的丈夫是醬圍裏的小開，三十多歲的一個土老兒，一臉肥肉，粗眉大眼，大掛長袍，腰包飽滿的人物。」</p>
<p>「哦！她爲什麽不嫁一個漂亮一點的人？」</p>
<p>「唉！老弟！」哥哥把大衣脫了，有些興奮地說「這是眞眞二十世紀的哲學，可說這位小姐的眼力一些也不差啊：除了錢以外還怕甚麽？」</p>

<p>鄙人自民國十八年，踏進本埠某商店後，與同事某君相契，由朋友而結爲金蘭之好。民國二十年，得得擢升爲出納員。二十一年夏，這位譜兄，因丁了父艱，請假回里：臨時的時候，他向我私宕了大洋二十五元。不料在他没有回店的時候，我自己也家遭不幸，不得不束至返里，所有經手的事情，照例交給經理所指定的另一同事。事君私宕一事，當然爲經理所知：但他並未加以可否。兩星期後我的譜兄回店供職；我呢因爲種種關係，辭職别就。頃接舊同事來信得悉某君於去年捲欵潛逃；所有我經手的宕脹，已奉經理命、劃入我的賬内；不日就要來信責償了。請問此欵鄙人應否承認：承認了於鄙人名譽，有何妨害；倘我置之不理，經理能不能向我保證人追償？再此欵萬一要付的時候，可否托人轉？我現在渴望你的答復。（下略）</p>
<p>李幼章謹上</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸ</p>
<p>編者按；金錢這東西，實在可怕極了；除非你絶塵逃世，才得與他絶緣；否則就不免要同他發生關係：而且一經經手，弄得不好，就要負相當責任。到那時責有攸歸，不由你不忍痛承認呢。</p>
<p>李君的這件事，就是一個例子。李君因爲要吃飯，並且要吃比較舒服一些的飯，經理升他爲出納員的時候，當然願就，而且勢必十分樂意。但是做了出納員，麻煩就來了：當他的譜兄向他商量私宕這二十五塊錢的時候，他什樣能夠回絶呢？有些人說起來，總要派李君當時，本不該不告知經理，私自作主：但我們以爲，這些官話是不對的。你想資本家的心腸，是何等的硬：若然禀明經理，這事情就無望了：以誼切金蘭的李君，呌他如何能夠硬得起這只手呢。後來李君的譜兄，竟捲欵潛逃；在一般人看來，又要派李君不是了，他們會說「你眼光也太差了，竟與這不長進的人，如此要好，現在你賠累幾鈿，實在可憐不足惜。」我們却以爲這話又錯了；一個歹人在没有發覺之前，實在是不容易分辯得很：何况一般人的捲欵潛逃。大半也爲了環境所迫；除非窮極無聊。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>誰肯幹這種自絶於人的勾當呢。所以我們看來，李君對於賠償這筆錢的事情，心有不甘，也是不能免的。但是可嘆得很，這世界還是在資本主義籠斷之下，法律也是爲資本家作倀的；任你如何不願，你是逃不了責任呢。即使你不賠，你的保證人就要負連帶責任。至於承認了這筆欵子，於名譽有何妨礙一層。這却可以不成問題；當你請假回里的當兒，經理知道這私宕事情的時候，他不置可否，就是他承認這筆錢，確是你譜兄所借宕的表示。現在你忍痛賠償，非但不損名譽，並且還要說你能負責任呢。講到交付的方法，當然以面致爲最妥，否則托人轉交亦可，祗須防不要再所托非人罷了。</p>

<p>— ＥoFalkowski著　志翔節譯</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>從加丁和亞克兩條街的樓臺前面，向那班流汗。而生活受着礦廠的汽笛所支配的工人望着丨每晨的汽笛聲驅使他們跑進神秘的煤坑，直到晚上再逃出來的工人：他們塗滿了污泥的面孔，穿了惡氣的衣服，在在暗示着他們在煤坑中生活的可怕：那裏不是一般生活安閒的人們所能想像或是久留的地方。</p>
<p>礦工是夢想不到城市的人們的愉快的。當礦廠的汽笛響了，很容易地表顯出社會上人們的生活的不一樣：一班人在早晨六點鐘，汽笛雖然響了，可是不能指揮他們的行動仍然可以安睡；另一班人，在這時就必須服從汽笛的命令，跑到那可怕的煤坑中去，爲了麵包而奮鬥。</p>
<p>這個城市是安全地擁抱在高原山谷中，不受外界的侵擾。離開此地很遠的許多城市，如紐約，波司　，常有爲了經濟而發生的鬥爭，但，在這山谷擁抱中的小城是很平靖的；只見烟囱中的烟霧，在秋日暮色中嬝嬝地繚繞在空際。</p>
<p>這城好像個夢游者的微笑似的一年一年地過去中，有無量數的煤車輸送到市塲去和其他的燃料競爭着。因爲最近的罷工，却使這軟煤和煤油的銷路超過了那一向銷路普遍的硬煤了。牠在過中的時光，在市塲上佔着優超的地位，現在却不能再維持了。那登在報紙上的大廣告迷惑了一般人購買燃料的目光。此時的　煤。似乎火爐都對牠表顯一種冷淡而譏笑的神氣。軟煤呢，以前的銷路不能和硬煤並駕齊驅的、現在，　在那平日只贜高貴的硬煤的地室中大大的活動起來了。</p>
<p>在礦工聨合工會中根據了「合作與效力」的一個口號，對於硬煤罷工的工人應該表示同情的。同一的工會中，工會的領袖分化了硬煤工人和軟煤工人之間的公共利益，劃了一條鴻溝。當硬煤工人罷工時，軟煤工人就應該加倍地工作着，以供應社會上燃料的需要。同樣的，當軟煤工人要求改良待遇而罷工時，硬煤工人覺得不關痛癢似的，除了捐助些微金錢之外，還是照舊地工作而且很快樂地努力地工作　　應付燃料急切地需要。王會很巧妙地利用了這雙方面彼此的不關痛癢。各行各的秘訣，這種現象不斷地繼續着。</p>

<p>(Beiping) A gentleman left Chengde and returned south when it was abandoned, and has now arrived in Beiping. According to him, the Rehe army has not been paid for two years, and the soldiers are resentful and lack the will to fight. The local people are being exploited and have no way to appeal. This time, when the Japanese army invaded, the troops on the front line, except for some guest troops, did not do their duty. The people also lacked the spirit of cooperation with the army. After the fall of Lingyuan and Chifeng, Tang was panicked and ordered that all vehicles transporting ammunition and supplies be impounded. He swept away valuables and led his concubines and concubines, escorted by more than 2,000 guards, and swarmed out of the city. Before Tang left the city, he met with a foreign reporter. While they were talking, Tang suddenly excused himself to change clothes and never returned. The reporter sat and waited for a long time, not knowing what had happened. After Tang left the city, the provincial capital was ownerless, and the people were panic-stricken. Those who heard the news and fled for their lives were on the road one after another, supporting the old and carrying the young, which was unbearable to witness. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>

Wang Shuchang, Jiang Bocheng, Yang Jie, Rong Zhen, Ji Yiqiao, and others were all at the station to welcome them. The Military Affairs Commission also sent a band, guards, and security teams to greet them at the station. After He alighted from the train, he rode in a car with Jiang to Juren Hall in Zhongnanhai to stay, temporarily using the place as He's office. Those who came with He also included Wang Lun, Xie Zhongyuan, and more than 20 guards. Zhang and the generals in Beiping, such as Fu Zuoyi and Li Fuying, visited He at Juren Hall one after another at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon.

The central government is actively responsible for military affairs. After he arrives in Beiping, he will discuss countermeasures with all parties. Generals who retreat without a fight should be severely punished to deter others. The date of his stay in Beiping cannot be predicted. President Song's visit to the north has not been scheduled. If needed, he will come. He and more than 20 followers will stay in Beiping for a short time in several cars. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>To Discuss Defense and Counter-Offensive Plans</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central government officials held an emergency meeting at 9:00 this morning due to the large-scale Japanese invasion of Chengde to discuss national defense. Decisions were made on defense and counter-offensive plans, and telegrams were sent to the generals in North China to follow them. (5th Special Dispatch) (Nanjing) All circles in Nanjing were saddened and indignant upon learning of the news that Tang Yulin had abandoned Chengde. According to a certain important person, the result of the Rehe war was unexpected. However, the people of our country should not be discouraged by this and should unite to support each other and work together to recover it. It is not a difficult task. Since the matter is already like this, everyone should remember the disaster of national destruction and family ruin, rise up to save the country. The government has ordered He Yingqin to go north to preside over the anti-Japanese military affairs in North China together with Acting Chairman Zhang. It is estimated that he arrived in Beiping on the 5th. As for how the central government will deal with Tang's responsibility for defending the territory, it is under discussion and there will be a serious expression. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">The Crisis After the Fall of Rehe <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Following the loss of half of the country in Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, and just when the people of the entire country were anxiously waiting and hoping, a sudden thunderbolt struck, and Rehe was declared to have fallen again.</p>
<p>Indeed, the fall of Rehe was already expected by us. After all, with Tang Yulin, who only knew how to levy exorbitant taxes and squeeze the lifeblood of the people, saying that he could fight to the death against Japan was something we dared not believe. Moreover, this lonely city with its setting sun and dying embers, under the fierce firepower and heavy troop attacks of the Japanese, would ultimately be unable to withstand this dangerous situation, which was also an inevitable result in fact. However, we believe that Rehe's mountainous terrain is a natural defense. If our army could have even a fraction of the determination to resist, the enemy would not have been able to drive straight in. At the same time, since the situation in Rehe became critical, the military authorities in North China repeatedly expressed their determination to defend Rehe to the death. Military bonds for defending Rehe and resisting Japan have also been issued. Perhaps with considerable resistance, the situation of confrontation could have been extended for at least several months. Even if Rehe could not ultimately avoid falling, the Japanese would have had to pay a huge price. However, today, it has been only ten days since the Japanese army officially launched its invasion of Rehe, and Chengde has already been lost. In a mountainous terrain with natural defenses, the Japanese army has been able to enter as if there were no people. The Chinese army on the front lines of Rehe has been acting as a guide for the Japanese army. Otherwise, no matter what, the fall of Rehe would not have been so rapid.</p>
<p>Rehe has already fallen. According to a telegram from Beiping, Zhang Xueliang expressed indignation, severely reprimanded the righteous army for not firing a single shot, ordered them not to retreat, and issued an arrest warrant for Tang Yulin, who abandoned the city and fled. This kind of severe measure is something we strongly endorse. However, since the September 18th Incident, the government has never punished the generals who abandoned their posts, lost territory, and retreated at the sight of the enemy. Tang Yulin's abandonment of the city and flight is therefore not an isolated incident. Tang Yulin's crime deserves death, but is Tang Yulin the only one whose crime deserves death? Who abandoned the Northeast? Who abandoned Jinzhou? Who abandoned Yuguan? Only with the main generals who did not resist could Tang Yulin dare to abandon the city and flee. Only with no punishment for those who abandoned the city could Tang Yulin dare to have no reservations. Now Rehe is lost. Tang Yulin has fled. The people of the entire country look north with grief and indignation, already feeling that they have no tears to shed. If only one Tang Yulin is arrested, how can the grief and indignation of the people of the entire country be alleviated?</p>
<p>The loss of Rehe was not due to the Japanese army's attack, but to our country's consistent policy of [not striving for national survival]. Perhaps some short-sighted people believe that with the loss of Rehe, the Japanese have achieved their goal, and from now on, both sides can live in peace and without incident. This can be seen from the fact that government bonds have risen instead of falling. However, they do not know that the crisis facing our country after the fall of Rehe is becoming more and more serious. First, with the removal of the barrier to North China, Beiping and Tianjin have no defenses to rely on, and North China will be under Japanese control at all times. Second, with the fall of Rehe, the supply route for the Northeast Volunteer Army has been cut off, and the hopes of the 30 million people of the Northeast for the government to recover the lost territory have also vanished. Third, due to the stimulation of the Rehe Incident, North China may form a confrontation between [resistance] and [non-resistance], giving the Japanese an excuse to advance further. Fourth, how to settle the troops retreating from Rehe, and the issue of public security, are also extremely worrying. In short, after the fall of the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, there is still the fall of Rehe. After the non-resistance of the September 18th Incident, there is still the non-resistance of Rehe. We say every day that we will share the national crisis together, but the result of sharing the national crisis is like this. Our nation has no way to explain itself to the world, and our military authorities have no way to explain themselves to the people of the entire country.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Inaugural Address of the Thirty-Second President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Externally...Maintain the Dignity of Treaties and Seek to Restore World Trade Prosperity</p>
<p>Internally...Strive to Stabilize Financial Panic and Relieve Rural Distress</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's long-awaited inaugural address was mainly focused on domestic affairs, discussing in detail the stabilization of finances, the restoration of normalcy, worker unemployment, and rural distress, in order to address the various thorny issues currently facing the new government. As for foreign policy and international issues, there were only a few words, the main points of which were roughly as follows: "The international trade relations of our United States are important, but at this time, they are secondary to establishing a solid national policy. I will do my best to seek to restore world trade through international economic adjustments, but the urgent domestic situation today cannot wait for this to be achieved first. As for the position of world policy, I am willing to offer this country to the policy of good neighborliness. Anyone who is determined to respect their own rights and the rights of others, and who respects their treaty obligations and sanctity, is our good neighbor," etc. As for Roosevelt's speech on domestic affairs, the main points were roughly as follows: "In a great country, we will be able to respond to these difficulties and return to the realm of prosperity. Therefore, we must first embrace a firm belief. The only thing we have to fear at this time is nameless, unreasonable, and unwarranted fear. This fear alone is enough to discourage people and turn progress into retreat. I firmly believe that you will support your leader in times of difficulty. With this spirit of mine and yours, we can undoubtedly cope with the common difficulties." Roosevelt then explained the country's current difficulties and the bright future ahead, and criticized the shortcomings of the American banking system. Then, he summarized the two ways to restore prosperity, stating: "Today's most urgent task is to provide people with work. This can be accomplished by the government dealing with the economic situation as if dealing with a wartime emergency, requisitioning resources to achieve a part of this. He believes that the government's plan to encourage the development of natural resources is not enough, and private individuals should also make great efforts in this regard. Although this problem is complex and difficult, he will lead the country to solve it." He also said that "some people must recognize that people are too concentrated in industrial hubs and should strive to make good use of the land and increase agricultural product prices. This will increase people's purchasing power. This plan will also prevent congestion losses and will be assisted by the federal, state, and local governments to reduce costs. If the state plans to supervise all transportation, communication, and public utilities, it can prevent unnecessary losses and save huge amounts of waste. Furthermore, all banks and lending and investment institutions must be strictly supervised to prevent the bad habit of using other people's money for speculative purposes. In addition, there must be a suitable and stable currency. These are all urgent tasks at present. He will prepare a special message outlining the plan to implement these plans and send it to Congress for its adoption." Finally, Roosevelt asked the entire country to abide by discipline and sacrifice for the public good. He guaranteed that he would serve as the leader of the people under this guarantee. He is prepared to follow his constitutional responsibilities and propose these plans to the Congress that is about to convene and ask them to quickly adopt them together with other plans that Congress proposes. But if this approach cannot be adopted by Congress and the state of affairs is still extremely critical, then he will ask Congress to give him the most powerful tools to deal with the emergency situation, expanding executive power to the extent that the president has during an invasion by a foreign enemy, so as to combat the emergency situation.

<h3 id="e16">The American Financial Crisis Intensifies <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Banks in Forty-Eight States All Engulfed in Vortex, Limiting Withdrawals</p>
<p>New Government Assembles National Strength to Plan Rescue Measures</p>
<p>(Special Session of Congress to be Called Within Days)</p>
<p>(Washington) The American financial crisis is intensifying. By sunset today, banks in all forty-eight states had fully implemented restrictions on withdrawals. Bankers from major cities are rushing to the capital to assist the government in jointly devising measures to restore normalcy. President Roosevelt has scheduled a meeting with Congressional leaders on Sunday to finalize the date for a special session of Congress. It is expected that the order for the session will be issued immediately after the decision is made, and Congress may convene as early as Tuesday. Even before the inauguration ceremony was completed, after the new President had just returned to the White House from the Capitol, party leaders were already conferring on the bills the President would propose. The President is currently preparing a special message to be sent to the new Congress, summarizing these bills. However, solutions to remedy the current situation have yet to be finalized late into the night. Bankers and officials are gathering proposals from all sides, selecting the most timely ones to compile into bills. As soon as the inauguration ceremony was completed, the new President began to address the economic problems. In addition to deciding to meet with members of Congress on Sunday, he also instructed Treasury Secretary Woodin to discuss relief measures with national bankers. He also agreed to personally meet with banking and financial experts from Philadelphia and New York on Sunday, and ordered all national postal savings banks to remain open for business as usual until further notice. Roosevelt has now begun to assemble the strength of national bankers to help quell the crisis, and is compiling detailed charts of the measures taken by various states to prevent bank runs and stabilize public confidence. He is also collecting reports from clearinghouse committees and bank resolutions from various regions for research and reference. The New York Clearing House Association has decided to issue small-denomination scrip to replace currency, jointly guaranteed by New York banks for commercial transactions. The Philadelphia Clearing House Association has suggested that Pennsylvania banks extend the moratorium for another week until satisfactory regulations are enacted. Furthermore, Philadelphia bankers have also suggested a ban on gold exports. Political circles here were alarmed upon hearing this news and inquired with the Treasury Department. However, the Treasury Department has not made a formal statement, only indicating that Woodin will discuss the matter after the bankers arrive in the capital in the next day or two. It is reported that at dawn today, only half of the forty-eight states had implemented restrictions. Upon hearing that banks in New York and Illinois had suspended operations, one state after another followed suit. By noon, when the President was inaugurated, most states had been engulfed in the vortex. Indiana and South Carolina were the last states to restrict withdrawals. However, in places like Enid, Oklahoma, the National Guard was mobilized to force banks to comply with the moratorium order. Even though the local banks had sufficient cash on hand, the authorities ordered them to suspend operations to maintain uniformity. Many financiers believe that this concerted action is beneficial to resolving the crisis, as it can put all parts of the country in equilibrium, making it easier to reach a consensus on favorable Congressional solutions. In places like Chautauqua, New York, after hearing the news that the state was also implementing restrictions, state troops were mobilized to protect banks to prevent accidents. However, depositors were able to remain calm upon hearing the news. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>(Washington) After President Roosevelt's inaugural address was broadcast nationwide via radio, Roosevelt shook hands with people near the podium and then rode in a car to inspect the parade. The crowd cheered along the way. The parade then began to pass in front of the viewing platform. However, there were incidents of demonstrations and disturbances by Communist Party members and unemployed workers in various parts of the United States today. In Detroit, the Communist Party gathered people to march on the main streets, demanding immediate payment of small bank deposits. In Chicago, Communist Party members and unemployed workers also stormed into the City Council, demanding relief money and food, but there were no riots. The situation in Pittsburgh was more serious, with police clashing with Communist Party members in the city, resulting in sixteen arrests. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>There was no wave of withdrawals. As for the proposal to ban gold exports, it is rumored that it is also accompanied by a suggestion to have the federal government guarantee bank deposits nationwide. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The talk of banning gold exports is rampant today. Financial experts say that it is indeed possible for the US government to ban cash from leaving the country on the one hand and allow people to freely exchange cash for currency on the other. As for the amount of currency in circulation, there is currently a reserve of 400 million gold dollars in the treasury as a backing. Therefore, banning gold exports only guarantees that the treasury's gold reserves will not flow out. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>

<p>Silk Prices Plunge, US Dollar Exchange Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese financial community is particularly concerned about the US financial panic. There are two opinions on its future prospects: one is that the United States will definitely ban gold exports, and the other is that it will continue to adopt a free policy. The reason for banning exports is to reduce the market price of gold and help the domestic economy boom, resisting imports. The observation of the free policy is that the United States has an overabundance of gold reserves, and even if it adopts a policy of devaluing currency, it will be difficult to create a boom. The Japanese financial community is particularly worried about the United States adopting a policy of banning gold exports, because doing so would eliminate Japan's foreign exchange boom and cause panic in Japanese rural areas. (United Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The US financial panic has affected the entire country. 80 to 90% of Japanese raw silk is sold to the United States, so market prices have plummeted. If the exchange rate against the US dollar falls to 25 cents, the losses suffered by foreign export trade in the second half of the year will be enormous. Key figures from the Japanese Ministry of Finance and the financial community have convened emergency meetings to discuss countermeasures. Because the US countermeasures have not been determined, Japan has not decided on the final countermeasures. Banks will temporarily suspend foreign exchange with the US tomorrow, and the countermeasures after the 7th will be discussed again tomorrow. (United Press dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>Inquires about France's Opinion on Sanctions and Arms Embargo</p>
<p>Says Will Maintain Same Stance as US and League of Nations</p>
<p>Havas Geneva Dispatch, 4th. French representative Paul-Boncour departs for home tonight. Prior to his departure, he discussed the work of the Disarmament Conference with Conference Chairman Henderson. He also met with Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China to the League of Nations, and Hu Shize, the Chinese envoy to Switzerland. The purpose of the Chinese representatives' visit to Paul-Boncour was to inquire about the French government's opinion on the situation in Rehe. At the last session of the League of Nations Assembly, Gu Weijun, based on the unanimous passage of the Nineteenth Committee report, requested the League of Nations to implement the various sanction provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant. It is believed that the purpose of the Chinese representatives' visit was to ascertain France's intentions regarding sanctions and the implementation of a ban on arms shipments to the Far East. According to Havas, Paul-Boncour only replied to the Chinese representatives that France would take the same stance as the member states of the League of Nations and the United States.</p>

<p>Japanese Ambassador to the Netherlands Says:</p>
<p>No War between US and Japan, East Indies Can Be at Peace</p>
<p>Reuters The Hague Dispatch, 4th. The new Japanese ambassador to the Netherlands, Saito, told a Reuters reporter here that Matsuoka's visit to the Netherlands was of a private nature. He would only stay for a few days and then go to London. There was no question of negotiating a non-aggression pact between the two countries with the Dutch government. There was no reason for the Dutch East Indies to be apprehensive. The oil stations on Borneo were indeed important to the Japanese Navy, but it would only be a matter of life and death if there was a conflict between the United States and Japan in the Atlantic Ocean. He said that there would never be a war between the United States and Japan that would make it necessary for Japan to lack a way to ensure oil supply. Japan adopted a friendly policy towards the Dutch Indies.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' proposal on withdrawing from the League of Nations has been finalized. A meeting of key officials will be held on the morning of the 6th to finalize it, and then a temporary cabinet meeting will decide it in the afternoon, after which the process of consulting the Privy Council will be adopted. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' plan, the notification of withdrawal from the League of Nations and its reasons are not separated. Only in the notification of withdrawal to the Secretariat are the shortcomings of the League of Nations and the impropriety of handling the Sino-Japanese dispute pointed out, and the reasons for withdrawal are recorded. The notification is written in Japanese, simple and clear, with only 1,500 characters. When the notification is submitted, the government's statement on the withdrawal will not be issued, and the notification will be used instead. The notification will be submitted to the Secretariat at the same time as it is published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Privy Council must be consulted as soon as possible. If the consultation is completed within one week, the Emperor will be asked to approve it on the 15th or 16th, and the notification will be submitted to the Secretariat of the League of Nations. (Dentsu dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is said that when the Japanese government formally notifies the League of Nations of its withdrawal, it will attach a statement saying that although Japan has had to withdraw from the League of Nations because of differences of opinion with the League of Nations on how to maintain peace in the Far East, Japan is still willing to do its utmost to promote international cooperation in order to maintain world peace.

<p>Second Task Force Fully Stationed at Qinhuangdao</p>
<p>Third Task Force Stationed in the Yangtze River, Sending Ships to Guard Southern China</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Chinese coast guard, the Ministry of the Navy released information at 4:00 AM this morning. (Ministry of the Navy Announcement) At the end of last year, the Outer Fleet, commanded by Rear Admiral Tsuji, which was responsible for guarding the coast of North China [Manchukuo], originally consisted of the warship Hirato and three destroyers of the Sixteenth Destroyer Squadron. After the Shanhaiguan Incident, the warship Tokiwa was added. At the time of the Japanese [Manchu] army's [invasion] of Rehe, fearing anti-Japanese behavior, the necessary deployment was made to protect Japanese residents. The special service ship Kamui departed Sasebo on January 28, the warship Tama departed Maizuru on February 28, and four destroyers of the Fifteenth Destroyer Squadron departed Kure, all joining the Second Outer Fleet. (1) Because the coast of Shanhaiguan, Qinhuangdao, and Dagu is frozen, it is very difficult for warships to move, but the maritime guard is still very complete. Currently, with the exception of the Tokiwa in Qingdao, the entire Second Outer Fleet is guarding Shanhaiguan and Bohai Island. The Third Fleet is guarding the Yangtze River basin, and the Magong Naval Base fleet is guarding the coast of southern China. The total naval force is 38 warships and more than 8,000 personnel. So far, there have been no accidents. (Dentsu dispatch, 5th)</p>

(3) How can we prevent Japanese warships from sailing and docking in our territorial waters and ports? (4) Can troops stationed in China be expelled?

(6) If the League of Nations considers this an act of escalation, or even a step towards war, will our international status be affected? (7) Even if the incident escalates, will the League of Nations invoke Article 16 of the Covenant? The above are all matters that must be considered in advance. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>Hankou Telegram. Please forward to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government's various ministries and departments. Also, to the Shanghai Aviation Association, the provincial and municipal governments and party headquarters, various national aviation salvation groups, and various legal entities. The Battle of Rehe has entered a phase of close combat. The war reports of late show that our hundreds of thousands of patriotic soldiers are fighting fiercely on the frontiers. The enemy's strong armor and sharp weapons have become ineffective. If we can have 500 aircraft to fight a decisive battle with the Japanese invaders, it will not be difficult to recover Liaoning and Shenyang. The people of the country, alarmed by the tragic bombing of Shanghai by enemy planes last year on January 28th, have initiated a national aviation salvation movement. The news has spread, and the country is in shock. The people of Hubei, patriotic, dare not lag behind. Therefore, on February 25th, the Hubei Provincial National Air Force Founding Association was formally established in Hankou, and branches were established in various counties and cities, aiming to recruit 600,000 members and raise funds for 15 aircraft in the shortest possible time, following the example of other provinces. However, in recent years, national salvation movements often start strong but end weak, with poor planning leading to little success. We now present three matters for the government and various national aviation salvation groups to pay close attention to, so that funds are not wasted and things can be realized: (1) Please implement the resolutions of the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of this session and unify the administrative construction of aviation. The provinces are each establishing their own forces, each seeking development, with talent and machinery forming their own factions. The orders of the central government are not followed, and the tragedy of internal strife can be expected. Even if China has 3,000 aircraft, the result could still be national demise. (2) Please unify the aviation salvation organizations in various provinces and strive for overall development. We advocate long-term resistance against Japan and must first have the people voluntarily establish the air force. The initial total should be 500 aircraft, with large provinces raising funds for 50 aircraft and small provinces raising funds for 30 aircraft. Each province should have a general association, and each county and city should have a branch. All organizations and groups should be automatic members. The country should have 10 million members, each donating 5 yuan. In the future, the people can donate 500 aircraft to the government each year. (3) Please ensure that the funds raised by the provinces and counties are fully concentrated in the provincial capitals by August of the 22nd year, with people of the highest reputation publicly elected to be responsible for safekeeping. At the same time, please designate the highest fund-receiving agency of the government and periodically convene representatives from the provinces responsible for safekeeping donations to the capital, together with aviation authorities, to determine the procedures for establishing the air force, so that by the end of the 22nd year, we will have 500 aircraft defending our airspace, flying in the sky. Although the people of Hubei have suffered through military calamity, we are willing to work together with our compatriots throughout the country to achieve this. The Hubei Provincial National Air Force Founding Association respectfully petitions.</p>

<p>Attempting to Sabotage Agricultural Production and Create Famine</p>
<p>Hitler's Anti-Communist Rhetoric</p>
<p>Provokes Repercussions in Russian Newspapers</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 5th. According to an announcement by the State Political Department today, seventy people have been detained for engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. During interrogation, they confessed that they were plotting to sabotage agricultural production and create famine. Agencies of the State Political Department have recently uncovered many counter-revolutionary sabotage organizations. These organizations are mostly hidden within a portion of the agencies of the Agricultural Commission and the State Farm Commission, especially in Ukraine, the North Caucasus, and various agricultural regions of Russia. The majority of their members are employees of state-run agencies, all from landlord backgrounds. Most of those arrested confessed to engaging in counter-revolutionary activities, plotting to sabotage agriculture. Their methods include damaging motor vehicles and other agricultural machinery, accumulating weeds, engaging in slow-downs and arson in motor vehicle yards and flax mills to reduce production, robbing collective farm grains, disrupting planting and harvesting movements, and plotting to murder livestock, etc.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 5th. German Chancellor Hitler's speech attacking the Soviet Union has provoked a strong reaction in the Soviet Union. The Soviet government's bulletin [Izvestia] today published a sharp editorial under the title [Clumsy Fool], saying, "Even with intimidation and provocation, the leaders of the National Socialist Party have clearly failed to fully control their chances of success in the election. Therefore, in addition to batons and machine guns, they are also trying to use their theoretical rhetoric on the eve of the election." On March 3rd, Mr. Hitler delivered a lengthy policy declaration. Everyone hoped that Mr. Hitler could state his plan to save Germany from its current dangerous situation, but the result was that he only used the Soviet Union as an example to prove the tragic results of communism. Although we do not want to respond to Mr. Hitler's [analysis] of the Soviet Union's situation, under these circumstances, even if German politicians do not want to save all their people, they at least want to save the German nation. Since Mr. Hitler has raised this [discussion], he should not blame us for being forced to respond. In recent years, the leading economists of the capitalist world have come to the Soviet Union to study its economic development. Even bourgeois scientists and politicians are discussing the possibility of implementing the Soviet Union's planned economic experiment in capitalist lands. This is not because of the collapse of the Soviet economy or the hardship of the Soviet people, but because of the development of the socialist economy, the elimination of unemployment, and the progress of Soviet culture. Mr. Hitler does not mention a word about the Soviet Union's collective agricultural construction, but wants to scare the Germans with stories about Soviet terror. The world's listeners will surely laugh at this. The National Socialist Party members call themselves German patriots and believe that they can better protect Germany's interests than others, but the policies they are pursuing are exactly the opposite, such as organizing civil war and launching indiscriminate attacks against the Soviet Union, the only country that does not harbor hostility towards Germany. They believe that this is a wise move, but we believe that with such National Socialist gentlemen at the helm, Germany's ship may not reach its destination." [Pravda] published an editorial titled [The Clown Takes the Stage], claiming that no one is unaware that the Reichstag fire was a provocative act by the National Socialists. All kinds of evidence prove that this is a re-enactment of the French Gogol affair. Hitler has only been in power for a month, but in this short period, the National Socialists have used every means to oppress German workers and peasants. In fact, the National Socialist forces' instigation of civil war will only increase Germany's internal strife, and the results of their foreign policy will be even more tragic. In just thirty days, those who call themselves [representatives of the nation] have clashed with the entire world. If they cannot carefully choose a different path, the newspaper concludes, "The party that bears the name [National] is isolating Germany and weakening its international position. Only such clownish policies can isolate Germany, but those who embrace such policies will probably not last long."</p>

<p>Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the House Resign</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 4th. The House of Representatives held an extraordinary meeting today. At the close of the meeting, the Speaker and Deputy Speaker resigned, much to the surprise of the general public. The Greater German Party introduced a motion demanding leniency towards striking workers. The House voted on the motion, passing it by a vote of 81 to 80. The Greater German Party, with the support of the Social Democratic Party, caused the government parties to become the minority. The Christian Social Party, which belongs to the government faction, was quite disadvantaged. At that time, the noise in the chamber became even louder, and the Speaker announced the adjournment of the meeting and withdrew to consult with the Deputy Speaker.

<p>Storm Troopers Armed Watch, Berlin Silent</p>
<p>Communists Concealed, But Secret Struggle Still Fierce</p>
<p>Germany's Future Fate Tied to This Result</p>
<p>Guomin, Berlin, 5th. Today is General Election Day. The morning passed quietly, indistinguishable from an ordinary Sunday, except that the election affairs, which are usually set up in front of public buildings, today have National Defense Party Storm Troopers and Steel Helmet members standing guard with their uniforms erect. Plainclothesmen also carried slogan boards of the Social Democratic Party and other parties, running around. In the last election, the Communist Party was the most powerful party. Today, even in the streets of the labor districts, they have disappeared. All the labor districts are unusually quiet, apparently due to special orders issued by the Communist Party leaders. But although the surface is quiet, the struggle is still going on. Judging from the current situation, the number of votes cast this time will certainly exceed the previous two elections. Havas, Warsaw, 5th. According to unconfirmed news from Berlin, the city of Berlin was extremely quiet this morning, with few pedestrians on the streets. However, most of the members of the National Socialist Storm Troopers were divided into several small groups, each group of about three or four people, as well as police and supplemental police, patrolling slowly on the main roads of the capital. At the street corners, police officers stood guard with Mauser rifles. At the entrance of the polling places, news vendors stood shoulder to shoulder with badges of various parties, without any discord, which shows that the situation is stable. President Hindenburg, accompanied by Secretary-General Meissner, went to a polling place nearby in the early morning to vote. When the President's ballot was dropped into the ballot box, some people cheered and welcomed him, as usual. Among them, some shouted [God bless you]. When the President slowly boarded the car and paid tribute to the crowd, photographers scrambled to take pictures. Vice-Chancellor Papen followed to the polling place shortly after. Foreign Minister Neurath also arrived soon after. The cabinet ministers Goring, Interior Minister Frick, and several other National Socialist cabinet members voted at another polling place.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 5th. The result of this election will determine the fate of Germany in the coming years, so everyone is extremely excited, especially in Berlin. The only question in the election district is the nation: Does it want Hitlerism? It is very difficult to predict the answer to this question. Hitler will certainly get the support of millions of people today, because only the National Socialist Party and its comrades were able to conduct organized propaganda. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party only relied on word of mouth. But Hitler may get an unexpected and unpleasant surprise. Now, looking at the labor districts of Berlin and other major cities, the workers are extremely jealous of Hitler, so they will never vote for Hitler. In past elections, many workers' homes flew red flags, but now they have disappeared, fearing insults from the National Socialist Storm Troopers. Many people expect that the Communist Party will not vote for its own party but will change to elect Socialist members, fearing that the votes cast by the Communist Party will be declared invalid. If so, the number of seats won by the Socialist Party will certainly increase. In addition, the number of seats won by the People's Party will also increase greatly, because former Chancellor Papen and Sellde are very popular among the middle class. As for the National Socialist Party, it may not be able to get 250 seats as in the election of July last year. According to this prediction, the right-wing parties combined may not be able to get the 51% of the total votes they hoped for. However, the abnormal situation and the [possible pressure] of the National Socialist brownshirts outside the polling places may greatly change this prediction. The police will serve the entire day to maintain order, and the brownshirts will help. The sale of alcohol is prohibited throughout the country today, as usual. The results of the election will not be known until late at night.</p>

<p>400 Communists Arrested Overnight Yesterday</p>
<p>Guomin, Berlin, 4th. The more liberal elements in the German government, seeing that the atmosphere in Europe cannot tolerate Chancellor Hitler's iron-fisted politics, are trying their best to stop Hitler and Goring from taking radical measures. But the Nazi Party's search and arrest of Communists has again created a new record in Prussia and throughout Germany today. Four hundred people were arrested in 24 hours. Since the Reichstag fire, no less than 4,000 people have been arrested. It is now rumored that Hitler intends to remain Chancellor regardless of the results of tomorrow's general election, and will begin a German rearmament plan, citing Geneva's failure to achieve military equality as a reason. France is said to be very alarmed by this, and most countries in Europe are also showing signs of shock and danger over Germany's recent developments.</p>

<h3 id="e78">The Mechanization of Soviet Agriculture (Part 2) <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Soviet Correspondence (January 15th)</p>
<p>Extent of Agricultural Mechanization: The so-called agricultural mechanization is the application of machines to operate all agricultural production processes, such as plowing, sowing, harvesting, threshing, and fertilizing, and to exclude manual labor. This is also called agricultural industrialization.</p>
<p>Agricultural industrialization has not yet been achieved in backward countries, let alone advanced capitalist countries, because capitalists are unwilling to invest in agriculture due to natural conditions (climate) and social conditions (private land ownership, divided into small plots). On the farmers' side, most are small economies and unable to purchase machines. Therefore, under capitalism, a distinct difference has formed between advanced cities and backward rural areas.</p>
<p>Since the revolution, the Soviet Union has nationalized land. And since the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, most farmers have been collectivized, so the fields in the countryside have become vast and without small plots. In other words, the prerequisite conditions for agricultural mechanization have been met. Therefore, the current economic policy of the Soviet Union, in essence, is to vigorously eliminate this difference left over from the previous society and implement large-scale agricultural mechanization.</p>
<p>The main driving force of agricultural mechanization is tractors, which drive the above-mentioned various operating machines. Because the situation in the fields is different from that in factories, Lenin dreamed that there should be 100,000 tractors working in the Soviet countryside. But by the end of 1932, there were already 147,800 tractors working in Soviet agriculture (compared to only 26,700 in 1928), serving 6.82 million households, accounting for 24.9% of all farm households. These farm households have all joined collective farms. It goes without saying that state-owned farms, which play a significant role in Soviet agriculture, are fully mechanized.</p>
<p>In 1928, one-third of all farm households in the Soviet Union were still using wooden plows to cultivate the land, which had been passed down for thousands of years. But by 1932, this type of wooden plow had been abandoned in the Soviet countryside. 48% of the total sown area and 53% of the spring sown area were cultivated by tractor plows. In addition, the number of farm households using horse-drawn machinery was only 287,000 in 1928, accounting for 1.8% of all farm households. By 1932, it had increased to 7.5 million households, accounting for 30.5% of all farm households.</p>
<p>Also, in 1928, three-quarters of the spring sown area in the Soviet Union was sown by hand. By 1932, the main sowing tool had become a seed drill, accounting for about 40% of the spring sown area. In 1928, the area harvested with old-fashioned sickles reached 44 million hectares. In 1932, the main harvesting equipment for grains had become tractor-drawn harvesters and new-style combine harvesters. Similarly, in 1928, 40 million meters of harvest were threshed using flails and other manual threshing methods. By 1932, the main equipment had become tractor-drawn threshers and combine harvesters.</p>
<p>In short, half of the current agricultural production process in the Soviet Union has been mechanized. Especially in terms of quality, it is noted that the mechanization is not of individual farmers, but of collective farms and state-owned farms. This means that the higher the degree of collectivization of farmers, the greater the degree of mechanization.</p>
<p>In terms of region, the agricultural areas such as Ukraine and the North Caucasus have the highest degree of mechanization. For example, in terms of the number of tractors in each region, Ukraine has 18.3% of all tractors in the Soviet Union, the North Caucasus has 12.2%, the Central Volga has 9%, the Lower Volga has 7.5%, Western Siberia has 8.5%, Central Asia has 7.5%, and Kazakhstan has 5.1%. Furthermore, in terms of the value of all agricultural machinery in the Soviet Union, it totaled 1.449 billion rubles in 1928 (calculated at 1926-27 prices) and had increased to 2.3 billion rubles by 1932. During the first Five-Year Plan, machinery applied to agriculture totaled 1.6 billion rubles. In 1928, all machinery in agriculture was worth only 1.149 billion rubles. From this, one can imagine the rapid advancement of agricultural mechanization.</p>
<p>The Lever of Agricultural Mechanization: Machine and Tractor Stations. The lever for implementing agricultural mechanization in the Soviet Union is the Machine and Tractor Station. It is run by the government in suitable locations selected in agricultural areas, and its role is extremely significant. The most important aspects are described below.</p>
<p>(1) It can promote the collective farm movement. Soviet publications claim that "Machine and Tractor Stations are the true organizers of collectivization." This is because when farmers in a village have just established a collective farm, they may not be able to afford to purchase machines. They can rent them from the Machine and Tractor Station, and the rent is paid after the harvest. At this time, poor and middle peasants who have not yet joined the collective farm see the benefits of using machines for cultivation and are willing to join. (2) Machines are concentrated together, and their efficiency is greatly increased. For example, in 1928, collective farms owned a total of 20,000 tractors, which served only 45,000 farm households. In 1932, collective farms and Machine and Tractor Stations owned 85,000 tractors. Due to the establishment of Machine and Tractor Stations, the number of farm households served (all of whom had joined collective farms) reached 6.82 million. Moreover, the 6.8 million collective farm peasants served by Machine and Tractor Stations had a sown area of 35.3 million hectares, which is an average of 5.18 hectares per household. The 8.1 million collective farm peasants not served by Machine and Tractor Stations had a sown area of 31.4 million hectares, which is an average of 3.9 hectares per household. The 10 million individual farmers had a sown area of 19.8 million hectares, which is an average of only 1.98 hectares per household. From this, it can be seen that the labor productivity of collective farm households served by Machine and Tractor Stations is two and a half times higher than that of individual farmers and 37% higher than that of collective farm households not served by Machine and Tractor Stations. The effectiveness of Machine and Tractor Stations can be imagined.</p>
<p>It can implement state leadership over collective farms. Therefore, the so-called implementation of agricultural mechanization in the Soviet Union is mainly to develop this network of Machine and Tractor Stations. In 1928, there was only one such Machine and Tractor Station. In 1930, there were 158. In 1932, there were 2,498, with a total horsepower of 938,000, serving 40% of collective farms.</p>
<p>At the same time, Machine and Tractor Stations have become the political and cultural center of the Soviet countryside. Each station is equipped with hospitals, schools, cinemas, clubs, libraries, etc. In addition, the offices of party and government agencies are also located here. This plays a significant role in eliminating the differences between cities and rural areas.</p>
<p>Tractor drivers and other various machine operators are all trained by Machine and Tractor Stations. In 1931, the number of people entering training classes for tractor, combine harvester, and automobile drivers reached more than one million. In 1932, it had increased to more than 2.5 million.</p>
<p>The Outline of Agricultural Mechanization in the Second Five-Year Plan. The Second Five-Year Plan decided that by 1937, all farmers must be collectivized and agricultural production must be fully mechanized. The lever of mechanization | Machine and Tractor Stations will be increased to 5,500 to 6,000 by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan. It is planned that by the spring of 1934, all collective farms will be covered by the network of Machine and Tractor Stations.</p>
<p>During the Second Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union can manufacture more than 170,000 tractors each year. Full agricultural mechanization is expected to require 15 million horsepower. The required tractors can be fully supplied by domestic manufacturers. Other auxiliary equipment is expected to cost 9 billion to 10 billion rubles, which is ten to eleven times more than the output in 1932.</p>
<p>Related to agricultural mechanization is the fuel problem. The only fuel currently used by tractors is petroleum. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, the 15 million horsepower required for agricultural mechanization will require 15 million tons of gasoline. To refine such a huge amount of gasoline, 45 million tons of crude oil are required. This will account for half of the planned oil production in 1937.</p>
<p>In addition, during the Second Five-Year Plan, it is stipulated that a portion of agricultural production must be electrified. By 1937, at least 9 billion to 10 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity must be applied to agriculture. It is planned to first electrify dairy products, state-owned and group beekeeping farms, followed by industrial crops such as cotton, hemp, sugar, and turnips. At most, 3 to 4 million hectares of field operations will be electrified.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Li Lieh-chun's Proposal <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>| Matters related to military secrets will not be published |</p>
<p>Central Committee member Li Lieh-chun was summoned to Beijing. It is said that he has an important proposal. Various newspapers have briefly reported on it, but the details are unknown. The results of the central government's discussion are also unknown. Now, with Li's consent, the reporter publishes a part of it, which is recorded as follows: [In the history of various countries in the world, the ages are different, and the positions of prosperity are also different. Internal worries and external troubles are almost universal to all countries. Those who do not handle them well will perish, and those who handle them well will turn misfortune into good fortune. Historical traces are numerous and cannot be listed exhaustively. However, when a country is in danger, the reason why it can turn danger into safety and chaos into order is that there is a kind of national spirit that runs through it. Internally, it can make great reforms, and externally, it can make great struggles. The situation in which our country finds itself today cannot be said to be not serious. If we want to break through this difficult situation and cross to the other shore, then we can only make great reforms in internal affairs and great struggles against foreign aggression, and only by consistently implementing this spirit can we succeed. I, Lieh-chun, went to Beijing to participate in the final discussion. I was ordered to accept the teachings, which is what I wanted. However, I cannot remain silent about my foolish thoughts. The proposals are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Regarding the minimum preparations for resisting foreign aggression, military affairs, finance, and diplomacy (there are eight items in total, which are omitted due to confidentiality). As for the military aspects of the national defense plan, the matter is very complicated. I heard that the competent authorities already have a considerable plan, but giving it practical implementation will surely benefit the actual situation. I will only choose a few matters to speak about. No matter what the plan is, there must be a superior military force and talent, weapons and materials, and huge economic resources and necessary military expenses must be fully prepared. And there must be a considerable amount of time before it can be successful. Of the matters described above, the economy is the most difficult. Although, even a small country like Japan can bear a national debt of more than 70 billion yuan. The domestic public debt, even this time of issuance, is quite large for the enemy. How can it be said that China, with its vastness and the patriotism of its people, is not as good as Japan? Even with frequent disasters, it should be able to raise huge national defense public bonds to relieve the national crisis and resist the violent Japan. The obligation and the right go hand in hand. If only the obligation is fulfilled and the right is not enjoyed, and even all facilities are contrary to the spirit of the Republic, then the people are treated as slaves. How can this succeed? If we can reverse this and make the people directly and indirectly work hard for national affairs, and the government and the people all follow the correct path of the Republic, then the intelligence of the people of the whole country will surely be gathered, and it will not be difficult to save the country and revitalize it. However, during this period, the minimum limit must be able to implement the following matters:</p>
<p>B. Regarding the minimum facilities for reforming internal affairs (1) Enforce the complete freedom of the people to assemble, associate, speak, publish, reside, and believe, and cancel the laws that hinder the aforementioned items. Officials and party departments in various places who have hindered the aforementioned actions shall be prohibited and severely punished separately. Clearly permit the people to freely organize political parties, but during the period of political tutelage, it must be within the scope of being able to abide by the Three Principles of the People. (2) The National Political Consultative Conference should be entirely elected by the people, and its rights should be like those of the lower house of various countries, resolving national affairs. (3) Expand the power of local autonomy. The people of each county shall elect county officials to carry out the political affairs of a county, and elect councilors to discuss and establish the laws of a county. Provincial governors of all provinces shall simultaneously implement popular elections. The aforementioned (A) items are necessary for resisting Japan. However, if (B) items are not resolutely implemented, then (A) items will be difficult to fully realize. And the things stated in (B) are already within the scope of this party, and are old tunes repeated, and are the most ordinary things. It is a matter of being able to implement them. When the national crisis has reached this point, I know that this party will definitely be able to use them. If it can be like this, then the people's attitude towards national affairs will surely change from pessimism to optimism, from passivity to activism. When factionalism is eliminated, the talents of the whole country will naturally gather. How can there be a situation where foreign troubles are not eliminated, the foundation of the country is not consolidated, and things are not improving day by day? It is a matter of sincerely planning for it. Therefore, I have prepared a brief statement and respectfully present it for public inspection and decide to implement it.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Disaster Situation Survey in Various Counties of Shaanxi Province <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Statistics Show 92 Counties Affected</p>
<p>More Than Three Million People Awaiting Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Xi'an Correspondence: In recent years, Shaanxi Province has suffered from continuous natural disasters and man-made calamities. As a result, the people in various counties are in dire straits, and the sight is devastating. Although the government has exhausted all means of relief, the number of people fleeing from various counties continues to increase. The rural areas are bankrupt, the fields are barren, and the vitality is not restored, which is truly regrettable. Of the 92 counties in the province, none were spared from the severe drought from the 17th to the 19th year of the Republic, and various disasters such as wind, hail, frost, and ice were added. As a result, there was no harvest for three years, especially in the Guanzhong area, with the western and northern parts of the province being the most tragic. Although there was a slight harvest in the 20th year, the overall calculation is still meager. This spring, the drought has returned, and the summer harvest has become a vain hope. Currently, the number of disaster-stricken people awaiting relief in the entire province has reached more than 3.345 million. The severity of the disaster can be imagined. Now, the disaster situation in various counties over the years is briefly recorded as follows, in order to seek the sympathy and relief of those who care:</p>
<p>Xianyang: From the spring of the 17th year of the Republic to the autumn of the 19th year, there was a severe drought, coupled with locusts. There was no harvest for three years and six seasons. To this day, people are fleeing, houses are being demolished, and the situation continues unabated. In the 21st year, wind, frost, drought, and hail successively caused disasters. More than 51,000 people are awaiting relief, and requests for relief have been made 13 times. Liquan: The disaster situation over the years is the same as that in Xianyang. In the 21st year, wind, frost, drought, hail, rats, and locusts all struck, and the lives of the people were in danger and panic. More than 60,000 people are awaiting relief, and requests for relief have been made 5 times. Qianxian: In the first half of last year, there were wind, frost, hail, and drought. In the second half of the year, there were drought and epidemics. The summer and autumn harvests were poor, and the population was almost completely evacuated. More than 81,000 people are awaiting relief, and requests for relief have been made 11 times. Wugong: Successive black frost and strong winds killed many wheat seedlings. There was severe drought in summer and autumn, coupled with hail disasters, and the autumn crops withered. There were also tiger epidemics, causing many deaths and injuries, and many people fled. Many villages were completely depopulated. More than 11,000 people are awaiting relief, and requests for relief have been made 8 times. Fufeng: Wind, frost, drought, epidemics, and various disasters struck one after another. Houses were dismantled and sold, and the villages were desolate. More than 78,000 people are awaiting relief, and requests for relief have been made 9 times. Qishan: The disaster over the years is as severe as that in Xianyang and other counties. In the first half of the 21st year, there were wind, frost, and drought. In the second half of the year, there were bandits and epidemics. People fled in different directions, and the villages were empty. More than 81,000 disaster-stricken people are awaiting relief, and requests for relief have been made 10 times. Baoji: There has been no rain for years, and there has been no harvest for six seasons. In the 21st year, wind, frost, drought, and epidemics exhausted the vitality. More than 85,000 people are awaiting relief, and requests for relief have been made 11 times. Meixian: From the 17th to the 19th year, many farmlands in various places were not sown. Recently, insects, hail, drought, epidemics, wind, and frost have struck one after another. Every household has no food, and every family is waiting to die. More than 63,000 disaster-stricken people are awaiting relief, and requests for relief have been made 8 times. Fengxiang: There has been no harvest for six seasons over the years, and no grains have been sown. Wind, frost, water, and drought have continued unabated. There have been too many deaths, and the villages have become ruins. More than 98,000 people are awaiting relief, and requests for relief have been made 5 times. Sanyuan: There has been severe drought for several years, and no grains have been harvested. Recently, there have been hail, epidemics, bandits, and droughts, and many people have fled. More than 97,000 people are awaiting relief, and requests for relief have been made 6 times. Jingyang: The disaster situation is the same as above.

<p>Japanese Consul in Wuhu Suddenly Requests Protection of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Wuhu correspondence: Recently, Japanese naval officers and soldiers stationed in Wuhu, as well as Japanese people residing in Wuhu, have been very active. They have been going ashore for sightseeing, secretly surveying the terrain, and holding overseas Chinese conferences, as if preparing for an emergency. Unexpectedly, the Japanese warship Fushimi suddenly sailed downstream at 7:00 this morning, while the former Feiying warship stationed at Jiangguanmenzhou in Wuhu moved to the inside of the Osaka lighter ship. At 4:00 in the afternoon, the gunboat Toba arrived in Wuhu from downstream. According to Japanese officers on the ship, the two destroyers Momoyuki will come to Wuhu tomorrow. Two officers of the Toba warship went ashore to meet with Japanese Consul Shibazaki and Shirao at the Japanese Consulate. The Japanese consul then drove to the Second District Administrative Commissioner's Office to meet with Commissioner Gao Tie-jun to request protection of the lives and property of Japanese residents. Mr. Gao also asked them to restrain Japanese soldiers and residents and abide by order. After about half an hour of discussion, the Japanese consul left and inspected Zhongshan Road and Beiping Road. However, the public is very strange about the various actions of the Japanese soldiers and civilians and the sudden request of the Japanese consul for the protection of overseas Chinese. (4th)</p>

<p>The First District Vigorously Implements Universal Training</p>
<p>This county was ordered to organize a defense regiment. Universal training was implemented in early last month. The regimental soldiers who should be trained in various townships and towns in the first district were divided into four groups. They gathered for exercises at 7:00 every morning. Many people were able to report on time, but there were also quite a few who stopped halfway or made excuses to shirk their responsibilities. Tai Shi, the head of the first district, and Gu Yangtian, the head of the district regiment, specially convened a meeting of township and town leaders and Jia chiefs yesterday to explain the reasons for the establishment of the defense regiment and its relationship with local autonomy. As a result of the discussion, the regimental soldiers in each township and town who dropped out or shirked their responsibilities must be notified by the township and town chiefs and Jia chiefs together with the township and town police, and the reward and punishment measures of the defense regiment must be printed and actively publicized so that the regimental soldiers know what to be vigilant about. With this supervision, the universal training in the first district should be effective.</p>

That night, the home of surgeon Zheng Yehan in Gutang outside the West Gate was also visited by more than 20 bandits, six or seven of whom were armed with pistols. Fortunately, the family discovered it early and rang the gong for help. Zheng Yehan held a self-defense gun and opened fire on the bandits.

<p>The Ministry of Finance, in view of the dispute between Changzhou Jing Shang and Jiuda Company over the sale of refined salt in Wuxi, previously presented an order from the Executive Yuan, stipulating that the prosperous roads in the Muyi, Yingyun, Kaiyuan, and Liangxiang areas should be the scope of Wuxi's refined salt sales. It was instructed to comply with the record. Later, Changzhou Jing Shang and the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce and others appealed that they could not accurately prove the boundaries of the original commercial port. They should submit another request to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Executive Yuan then instructed, "After investigation by the ministry, and according to the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce and Yang Shou-nan, the boundaries of the original commercial port could not be accurately proven, and the market conditions have changed greatly after many years. The area previously designated by the Executive Yuan should still be the scope of the refined salt sales area."

<p>Zhang Xiatang, the owner of the oil tanker of the Asia Petroleum Company, transported 3,000 boxes of kerosene in October last year and planned to deliver them to Suqian. In advance, he was instructed by an employee of the company to sell all the oil gradually after arriving in Gua and Yang. He put the ship into Shaobo Lake and set it on fire to try to destroy the evidence. Another owner, Chen Laoqi, received a reward of 2,000 yuan and fled. Zhang then reported to the police station. The police station detained Zhang Xiatang because the incident was bizarre and the circumstances did not match. While the investigation was underway, the company had received a secret report, found evidence, and detained Zhang and Zhou, the manager of Yangzhou, at the Public Security Bureau, and then transferred them to Zhenjiang. After being interrogated by the Security Department, they were transferred to the court for investigation. The case was recently concluded.

<p>Urges Chiang to Go North to Preside Over Military Affairs in North China</p>
<p>To Undertake Bandit Suppression Work in the Southwestern Provinces</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, met with reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Columbia Road at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. He expressed extreme indignation over the entire fall of Rehe in less than ten days, saying that not only the military commanders such as Tang Yulin, who were in command at the front line, should be severely punished, but also Zhang Xueliang, who was most responsible, should immediately resign to apologize to the people. Otherwise, in order to maintain its prestige and discipline, the central government should make a determination and order Zhang to be removed from all his positions. At the same time, we should unanimously urge Commander Chiang to go north as soon as possible to preside over the reorganization and save the crisis, and said that he had telegraphed Chiang yesterday afternoon, urging him to return to Beijing immediately. The following is a record of Sun's remarks.</p>
<h3 id="e93">The War Lasted Less Than Ten Days <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Sun said first that Rehe was a natural barrier, and the defending army numbered more than 100,000. Although the central government knew that the result would be defeat, it thought that it could at least last for two or three months. Zhang Hanqing also said to others that it would last for two months. During this period, it was enough to give our country's representative in Geneva an opportunity to work hard, so that the international community could develop more powerfully in sanctioning Japan. Unexpectedly, the war lasted less than ten days, and the entire front collapsed, and Chengde fell. It was really unexpected. Calculating that the Japanese army advanced 50 miles a day, as if entering an unmanned area, who can believe that it was resistance and that there was a fierce war? No wonder our overseas representatives repeatedly heard of the loss of important passes and believed that the generals defending the land were implementing the non-resistance policy, so they resigned in anger.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Zhang Should Resign Quickly <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Victory or defeat in war is common for military strategists, but retreating without fighting is a great shame. As for the issue of responsibility for this war, the military commanders such as Tang Yulin, who were in command at the front line, should be directly responsible and should be severely punished. Zhang Xueliang, as the highest military commander in North China, should of course bear the greatest responsibility. He had already lost three provinces in one day and handed over Jinzhou. Recently, he lost Yuguan again. At that time, the people of the country still hoped that Zhang would atone for his crimes and be determined to defend Rehe and fight the enemy. As a result, the four northeastern provinces were lost and the troops under his command collapsed without fighting. He shirked his responsibility and was spurned by the whole country. For Zhang's sake, he can only resign quickly to apologize to the people, give way to the virtuous and able, and support the crisis in North China. If he continues to linger in his position, I personally advocate that the central government should make a determination and order his removal.</p>

<p>In terms of the central government, the Rehe war was originally expected to last for two or three months, so Military Commander Chiang was stationed in Jiangxi to supervise the suppression of bandits because the bandits in Jiangxi were rampant. Now that Rehe has fallen and Pingjin is in critical condition, the situation in Chahar and Suiyuan is also in danger. Therefore, in terms of the situation, North China is more important and the Red bandits are less important. Therefore, we advocate that Chiang be invited to go north as soon as possible, and that troops be transferred from the southwestern provinces of Fujian and Hunan to be responsible for the work of suppressing bandits. Chiang is the highest military commander in the country, so the defense of North China can only be solved by Chiang's going north. I telegraphed Chiang this afternoon (that is, yesterday afternoon) to urge him to return to Beijing as soon as possible to work together to remedy the situation. I will also return to Beijing in the next few days.</p>

<p>When reporters asked about the issue of breaking off diplomatic relations with Japan, Sun said that our country's military is so uncompetitive, and even if breaking off diplomatic relations is realized, it will not help. When asked about the rumors that the central government and Japan are compromising, Sun firmly denied it, saying that at this time, unless one is insane, where would there be compromise? Sun finally said that all sectors are enthusiastic about saving the country and actively contributing, and he hopes that they will not be discouraged by the loss of Rehe. The central government has the determination to work together from top to bottom to deal with this unprecedented crisis.</p>

<p>The Soldiers on the Front Line Are Not Competitive</p>
<p>What Diplomacy Can Be Talked About?</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, reporters met with Vice Foreign Minister Liu Chongjie. Liu expressed his sadness and indignation, saying that in today's situation, the soldiers on the front line are not competitive, so what is there to talk about? And the diplomatic backing is non-existent, so what diplomacy can be talked about? No wonder the three representatives of the League of Nations have expressed their indignation and resigned. Today's (that is, yesterday's) newspaper reported that Minister Luo resigned in anger due to the loss of Chengde. I have not received a confirmed report on this, so I will return to Beijing this afternoon (that is, yesterday). If Minister Luo really resigns, I will definitely not linger in my position. Liu also said that although the Japanese army's invasion of Rehe is determined to win, we should resolutely resist it no matter what. Now, they have left without fighting. This responsibility should not only be borne by Tang Yulin, but also by the military commanders in the front. Now that Rehe has been lost, the security of Pingjin is completely gone. Although the Japanese side has repeatedly stated that it will never invade Guannei, no one can guarantee the actions of the Japanese, and how can we predict that they will not have other plans in the Pingjin area?</p>
<h3 id="e98">Song Ziwen's Speech <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Victory Comes from Failure</p>
<p>Deeply Hope That the People and Soldiers Will Be Awakened</p>
<p>Regarding the loss of Rehe, Dean Song published a speech as follows: After I returned from Rehe, the military commanders asked me for my personal observations on how long Rehe could be defended. I replied that it would be one week to ten days. At that time, those who heard my words laughed and said that even if the Japanese army drove straight in without any resistance, it would take several weeks to walk from the border of Rehe to Chengde. The ten-day period is ridiculous. I replied that the Japanese army's march cannot be calculated on foot. Tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of troops are scattered. They travel dozens of miles a day. They use written and oral reports as official announcements of victory. There is very little real support. This is the concept of the old-fashioned tactics that our country's military personnel have always been full of. They have not deeply understood the new tactics of modern warfare, which require months of continuous rear preparation for the final battle of a few days. It is said that raising soldiers for a thousand days is for a day's use. This is an ancient principle that has been overturned in modern warfare. Unfortunately, our country's military has not paid attention to it. In the recent changes in Rehe, the Japanese army has railways for transportation in the rear and a strict logistics system, plus the active preparation of numbers, to make the final blow. Airplanes, tanks, armored vehicles, over-mountain guns, and cavalry come at the same time like a storm. Looking back at the army defending Rehe in our country, there is absolutely no so-called staff work. The military commanders are leisurely and slow to act. Ancient-style vehicles are used for transportation. It takes several weeks for camels and mules to transport from Beiping to the front line to reach the front line. There is no contact between the various troops, and there is no preparation for anti-aircraft guns and trenching tools. The soldiers have only received training in the drill field. Rehe is a natural barrier. If scientific tactics are used to defend it with danger, it is really a situation where one man can guard the pass. If it is still in the old style, it will become a dead end. For example, a narrow valley is the best target for airplanes and artillery. In addition, the command cannot be unified, and once it is defeated in a dangerous place, it will collapse and cannot be recovered. Rehe is the land of our Republic of China. How can it be handed over to others? The enemy is indeed stronger than us, but our soldiers defending the land are ordered by the government to resist and fight to the death with airplanes, tanks, and artillery for more than ten days with their flesh and blood. The brave and fearless spirit of our soldiers is far superior to that of the enemy, but what is lacking is tactics and equipment. As a result, Chengde was lost. After this bloody battle of more than ten days, it is enough to prove that the rumors that the generals of Rehe were colluding with the enemy are nonsense, and it is enough to prove that Rehe was not lost without fighting. The government ordered the army to resist, and no matter how much the army can defend, the government's policy cannot be criticized. There is a saying in Western languages: We do not necessarily fight to win, and even if we fight and lose, we can find a bright path in defeat. Now the army defending Rehe has been defeated, and everyone is pointing fingers at it. But when we ask ourselves, instead of blaming others, why not be self-aware? The Rehe war has given us a major lesson and a major awakening. The blame for the defeat is not on one person or a few people, but on the military system of our country. We raise soldiers for days and millions, but the equipment is inferior, the food and clothing are insufficient, and they are like a rabble. Even if the soldiers can risk their lives in danger, they are simply driving the people of the city to fight. The blame should be attributed to the poor military system. In European and American countries, those who join the army are excellent people, but in our country, it is not the case. Education is far behind others, and the youth are not trained, and there are very few excellent people who join the army. I dare to say that if our country's military does not quickly awaken, abandon the tactics of the 18th and 19th centuries, and strive for the training of modern troops, then national defense will ultimately be empty talk. But we must not be discouraged by this. Victory comes from failure. If the whole country is united and fights, the iron hooves of the invaders will surely produce a pure and bright national concept in us. The rise of the nation comes from blood and tears. Last year at this time, our army fought bravely against the invading Japanese army in Shanghai for more than 30 days. The world praised it and regarded it as a national hero. But a year later, tens of thousands of troops in Rehe collapsed in ten days, and the world's eyes have changed again. In fact, the army that resisted Japan in Shanghai last year and the army that is now defending the land in Rehe have the same origin. Why is there such a huge difference in strength and weakness? One is inspired by the national spirit, and the other is bound by primitive tactics and cannot save themselves. I deeply hope that the people and soldiers will gain a thorough awakening from the tragic lesson and seek a bright path for our nation.</p>

However, we calmly review the facts that have occurred since the September 18th Incident, weigh the situation and reason, and dare not believe this rumor. May I ask who has been persevering in resisting the enemy and fighting against Japan for the past year? Those who have been called to flow through the remote fortresses, unyielding and unyielding, to win back the personality of the nation and to awaken the loyal souls of the Chinese people, which one is not our iron-blooded man, the patriotic compatriots? As for losing three provinces without fighting in less than a day, giving up Jin and Yu without resistance, singing and dancing, and enjoying the sights and sounds, and recently issuing a telegram stating that they will mobilize, the whole country has not blamed them for their past mistakes, and has praised them as being generous. Who would have expected that they would hold their troops and not attack, with hundreds of thousands of troops under their command, and bear the full responsibility of defending the land, but would allow 120 Japanese soldiers to drive straight into the natural barrier of Rehe, blaming the volunteer army, and even saying that they did not fire a single shot. If they want the whole country to shift the blame in this way, Heaven, oh Heaven, is there such a reason? If we allow right and wrong to be unclear, then in the future, enthusiastic people will surely be heartbroken and disgusted by the name of the volunteer army, and will abandon it completely. It will destroy the enthusiasm for relieving the crisis and saving together, and cut off the source of funds and supplies, causing the heroic soldiers of Xue Dou to be shot and killed, and die tragically under the iron hooves of the enemy, causing the future of the nation to be irrevocably lost. The matter is so tragic that nothing can be worse than this. After investigating the Northeast Volunteer Army, who have risked their lives, they have been relying on the support of various circles at home and abroad to continue their struggle. The international community has paid attention to them, and the enemy has not dared to relax. Previously, I read the telegram news published in the Tianjin Dagong Daily and learned that the entire Rehe army was unified under the unified command of the Beiping Military Branch in the previous month. In the time when the government and the people are helping each other, these volunteer armies, who had previously defied all dangers, are now receiving the treatment of the national army, and the support seems to be worry-free. But now, when the strong enemy is in front of them, they do not fire a shot. Is there such a reason? The complexity of the matter cannot be explained in detail. I hope that the people of the country will explore quietly when reading the newspaper, and not rely on hearsay, so as not to be pained by those who are close to them and pleased by the enemies. The hearts of the people are said to be in danger, and we have to shout loudly and ask all compatriots to pay special attention. He Yinqiao, Wang Hegao, Chen Yian, and other 124 people kowtow together. "</p>

Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai held a fundraising rally yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to raise aviation donations. At that time, the donors were quite enthusiastic. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Meeting Situation: When the meeting opened yesterday afternoon, more than 150 people from the same village, including Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Wu Zhihao, and Yuan Ludeng, attended. Fang Jiaobo served as chairman, Chen Qibo as recorder, and Dong Xinqin as master of ceremonies. First, the chairman reported, saying roughly that the violent Japanese bandits were invading, and they were sending troops to attack Pingjin. If the people did not fight, they would not be able to survive. If the whole country did not unite as one, it would be impossible to save the crisis. Our army is not lacking in tactics, but it is really oppressed by the air force. This is undeniable. There are more than 600,000 fellow villagers living in Shanghai. If each person donates one yuan, we can buy five fighter planes. If the people of the whole country can do this, the future of the country will be promising, and so on. Then, General Captain Yu Qiaqing, Chief of Staff Wang Wenhan, Zhang Shenzhi, Yuan Ludeng, Wu Zhihao, and others gave speeches one after another. The speeches were lengthy and are omitted here.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Donations: After the representatives spoke, it was decided to first establish a basic team. Yu Qiaqing, Wang Wenhan, Qin Runqing, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Jiguang, Jin Tingsun, Wang Boyuan, Sun Hengfu, Zhou Zongliang, Yu Zuoting, Wu Zhihao, Sun Meitang, Zhu Meixian, Wang Dongdun, Mao Heyuan, Xu Yunchan, Zhou Qiankang, Jin Runxiang, Chen Zhi, Wu Yaqin, Chuan Xiao'an, and other 20 people were selected as the basic team. Each team pledged to raise 5,000 yuan. People were still being sought for the basic team, including Yu Bao’san, Xu Maotang, Liu Hongsheng, Le Zhenbao, and Liu Pinsan. After the basic team was finalized, the search for combat teams continued. Each team pledged to raise 500 yuan. More than 290 teams were recognized on the spot. In addition, more than 300 teams pledged to raise 200 yuan for the demolition team. Finally, Yuan Ludeng introduced Mr. Zhou Weiqiao, a fellow villager, and Ms. Zhou Anqing, who donated 500 yuan from the birthday celebration of her late father, and 400 yuan of her own money, plus 100 yuan of Yuan Ludeng's gift money, totaling 1,000 yuan, all of which were used to help the aviation fund. Then, 11-year-old child Jiang Chengjia also donated 100 yuan that he had saved for candy. Those who stepped forward to donate on the spot added up to more than 3,000 yuan, which shows the patriotic enthusiasm. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM. (Dagong News Agency)</p>
<p>Shanghai General Labor Union: In order to raise funds for the "Shanghai Workers' Plane," a discussion meeting was held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, bringing together representatives from all sectors of the city's labor community to discuss practical implementation methods. There were more than 200 representatives from various labor unions. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Situation: After the meeting was announced, Zhu Xuefan was publicly elected as chairman, and Ye Gonglun as recorder. First, the chairman reported, saying roughly that the violent Japanese are invading the Northeast and are wreaking havoc with airplanes. Because our country lacks aviation weapons, although we have risen up to resist, we have ultimately failed to achieve victory in the war. The entire Shanghai labor community knows the importance of aviation to save the country, and the donation of airplanes cannot be delayed. Therefore, we plan to raise 100,000 yuan to raise a "Shanghai Workers' Plane" so that we can fulfill the duties of the city's labor community and complete the work of saving the country through aviation. All workers should rise up bravely. How to proceed to achieve success? We should ask the representatives to express their opinions and discuss them in detail, and so on. Then, Committee Member Li Yongxiang reported on the progress of raising funds for the "Shanghai Workers' Plane," and Zhu Xuefan reported on the enthusiastic support of the various labor unions. Then, representatives Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, Lu Muqin, Zhao Zhenhui, Li Mengnan, and others successively stood up to express their opinions and contribute various implementation plans to each other.</p>
<p>Resolutions: After the representatives expressed their opinions, the following resolutions were passed: (1) All labor unions must confirm their donations before the deadline and report to the meeting. (2) The deadline for payment of donations is one month, which may be extended if necessary. (3) Incentive measures will be formulated by the Fundraising Committee. (4) Donation items will be published in the newspaper daily to show good faith. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were passed.</p>
<p>Grain, Flour and Oil Cake Trade Association: The Executive Committee held its 6th meeting of the second session yesterday afternoon. Chairman Gu Xin reported that the executive committee members were invited to a meeting today because the China Aviation Association was soliciting team leaders. Five members of the association were selected, and we ask that you discuss how to solicit team members. It was decided to send letters to the eight professional associations to be responsible for soliciting team members as much as possible. All the committee members present were very enthusiastic and volunteered to carry out the task separately. It is expected that the results will be considerable.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Wu Jingxiong Discusses Constitution Drafting <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Preliminary Work to Be Completed Before the Sixth</p>
<p>Consideration Will Be Given to Opinions from All Parties</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency called on Mr. Wu Jingxiong, Vice Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, at his private residence this morning to discuss the constitution drafting work. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Decided Sections: Mr. Wu said that the assumed sections are the territory, form of government, sovereignty, and flag colors discussed by the first group of the Constitution Drafting Committee. The territory is listed in the constitution, the form of government is the Republic of the Three Principles of the People, sovereignty belongs to the people, and the flag colors are Blue Sky, White Sun.</p>
<p>Under Discussion: Currently under discussion is the second group's rights of the people, obligations of the people, and people's livelihood. A meeting was held last Tuesday. There are many types of people's rights, and it was impossible to list them all at once. The ones that have been listed number as many as 18, which are similar to the 23 articles of Article 6 of the Provisional Constitution. The biggest difference is that Article 19 of the current Provisional Constitution stipulates that the people shall enjoy the right to inherit property in accordance with the law. The assumption of the subcommittee is to modify it to the people enjoy the right to inherit property, but the law may restrict it. In addition, Article 21 of the Provisional Constitution stipulates that the people have the right to sue in law in accordance with the law. The three words "in accordance with the law" are redundant. This law is the so-called constitution. The subcommittee assumes to modify it to the people have the right to sue in court in accordance with the law. The two words "in accordance with the law" refer to the law of procedure. The group is scheduled to continue the discussion on the 8th, and a plenary meeting of the Drafting Committee will be held on the 9th to make assumptions.</p>
<p>Preliminary Drafting: The constitution draft research procedure stipulates that the first week, February 23 to March 2, will discuss the territory, groups, sovereignty, and flag colors; the second week, March 2 to March 9, will discuss the issue of people's rights; the third week, March 9 to March 16, will discuss the issue of people's obligations; the fourth week, March 16 to March 23, will discuss the issue of the National Assembly; the fifth week, March 23 to March 23, will discuss the issue of the balance of power between the central and local governments; the sixth week, March 29 to April 5, will discuss the issue of the central government system; the seventh week, April 5 to April 13, will continue; the eighth week, April 13 to April 20, will discuss the issue of the provincial system; the ninth week, April 20 to April 27, will discuss the issue of the county system; the tenth week, April 27 to May 4, will discuss the issue of the right to interpret the constitution and sanctions for violations of the constitution; the eleventh week, May 11 to May 18, will discuss the issue of the exercise of the four powers, the issue of people's livelihood, and the issue of national education; the twelfth week, May 18 to May 25, will discuss the issue of the military system and the issue of national accounting. Preliminary work must be completed by May 25. Afterwards, the assumed items will be reconsidered based on the opinions of all parties and the people.</p>
<p>Presidential Issue: At this point, the reporter asked Mr. Wu for his opinion on the issue of the head of state. Mr. Wu said that he advocates the presidential system. The reporter also asked, "In your opinion, can a military person be the head of state?" Mr. Wu replied, "All people in the Republic of China, whether military or non-military, are equal. Anyone who is respected by the people can take office and cannot be restricted. Don't you hear of the late President Washington of the United States and President Hindenburg of Germany?" At this point, the reporter took his leave.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Ancient Relics Transported from the South Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>A Total of 1,054 Boxes</p>
<p>Stored at the Former Site of Renji Hospital</p>
<p>The ancient relics from the Forbidden City in Peiping left Peiping on the 7th of last month and arrived in Pukou on the 9th. Because the central government had not decided on the storage location, they were stranded in Pukou for more than two weeks. They were shipped from Pukou on the 3rd of this month due to the central government deciding to store them in Shanghai. The 1,054 boxes of ancient relics stored in Shanghai arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday and were transported by automobile to the former site of Renji Hospital at No. 26 Tiantang Street for storage. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e104">Arrival in Shanghai <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangjing ship loaded the ancient relics in Pukou on the third day and crossed the river to Xiaguan to decide where to store them. The cases of previous dynasties were transported ashore and are now placed in the auditorium of the Executive Yuan. The rest were loaded on the Jiangjing and sailed directly to Shanghai. The Jiangjing entered the port at Shangshi yesterday morning. At 12:00 noon, the ship docked at Jinliyuan Wharf. Soon after, Li Zongtong, Secretary-General of the Museum, inspected and took over. At 1:00 PM, four Mautai foreign company trucks and workers were hired to transport the relics to the sixth floor of the cement building at the former site of Renji Hospital for storage.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Ancient Relics Transported to Shanghai <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter asked Wu Ying, the secret construction officer who accompanied the ancient relics to Shanghai, about the ancient relics transported to Shanghai. According to him, the total number of boxes transported to Shanghai was 1,056, including books, including the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, and calligraphy and paintings, including Wang Xizhi's "Clear Weather After Snowfall", which is one of the three rare treasures. The rest are bronze wares, including scattered-character plates and jade wares, and miscellaneous items. The number of boxes transported to Beijing was not limited to this number. However, a department case has been preserved by the Executive Yuan yesterday, so there are only 1,054 boxes. The second batch of ancient relics in Peiping will also be transported to the south. However, we must wait for the empty cars returned from Pukou to go and transport them. In the future, they will probably still have to be transported to Shanghai for storage.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Wharf Protection <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>After the ship arrived in port, the capital's original constitutional soldiers, a company with machine guns, escorted the ship to Shanghai. However, when they arrived at the wharf, the Public Security Bureau dispatched Captain Lu Ying of the Detective Team and Inspector Zhang Zhishan, the Water Patrol Team, etc. to go to the waterway for guard protection. The surprise preparedness headquarters and the French Concession authorities also sent detectives to assist in maintaining order and set up temporary posts at the wharf, which was very strict.</p>
<h3 id="e107">A Glimpse of the Warehouse <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The reporter visited the temporary warehouse at the former site of Renji Hospital in the afternoon. At that time, half of the ancient relics had been moved. The gate of the house was guarded by Vietnamese guards. Each automobile was jointly protected by a staff member of the Forbidden City and a member of the detective team. Although the surroundings were surrounded by iron cabinets and glass windows, there was fear of leakage. Iron wire mesh was temporarily installed by carpenters. The ancient relics arrived yesterday only reached the third and second floors, and the fourth floor was still empty. Each box of ancient relics was numbered and marked with the word "Wu," which means books. The more valuable items were packed in the original wooden boxes, and the less valuable ones were packed in ordinary large wooden boxes, such as those used to pack cigarettes. Although the house in front of the house was the Renji Hospital, Renji was also leasing it. It is said that the original house belonged to a foreign merchant.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Escort Returning <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>After the constitutional soldiers who escorted the ship to Shanghai yesterday arrived in Shanghai, they were taken over by the local military. Therefore, Secretary-General Li Zongtong ordered them to go to the South Railway Station and take a train back to Beijing last night. As for Secretary Wu Ying, who led eight combatants to Shanghai, was still in the process of sorting things out yesterday. In about two or three days, he would return to Beijing together with Chen Xian, Zhu Zongliang, Zhai Zonghan, and Wang Jinliang, the transport personnel dispatched by the Executive Yuan, and then go to Peiping to take care of the south transport of the second batch of ancient relics. From left to right: Mr. Li Zongtong and Mr. Wu Ying, personnel escorting ancient relics to Shanghai (photographed by Huadong News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e109">Li Zongtong Speaks <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The reporter met Li Zongtong, Secretary-General of the Palace Museum of Ancient Relics in Peiping, in the warehouse on Tiantang Street. At that time, Wen Hong'en, Director of the Public Security Bureau, was also at the French Concession Police Station. Section Chief (French) was contacting Mr. Li about the night protection. The French police agreed to dispatch five people to jointly protect the site with five detectives from the Public Security Bureau. According to Mr. Li, the ancient relics have now been transported, but this number is only one-fifth of the total. In the future, they will continue to be transported to the south one after another. We are now hiring Mautai freight trucks. At this rate, it will definitely not be finished by tomorrow. Therefore, ten more trucks were hired in the afternoon. Even so, it will not be completed until 8:00 PM in the evening. The warehouse rent is 3,750 taels per month, and the contract is for half a year. In the past, it was decided not to store it in Shanghai anymore, so there was a refund of 2,000 taels. Now that we have leased it, we will continue to do so. Regarding the security of the warehouse, I am negotiating with Director Wen, but it has not yet been decided. In general, there will be a random inspection of the ancient relics once every period. I will complete the Shanghai affairs and then go to Beijing to report. As for the date of the south transport of the second batch and the storage location, it is difficult to predict. There is still space in the Shanghai house now. In general, the ones coming south in the future will still be stored in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Shanghai Fishery Association Held Its Inaugural Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Sent Representatives to Give Instructions</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Shanghai Fishery Association, which has been in preparation for many years, held its inaugural meeting at Dunhe Public Office, No. Lujiazhai Lane, Xiaodongmen yesterday. A total of more than 90 representatives of fishermen and fish merchants attended, as well as more than 100 guests, including Lu Yinchu, representative of the Municipal Party Committee, Wang Defa, representative of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Luo Yu, representative of the Jiangzhe Fisheries Administration Bureau, and other guests. At 10:00 AM, the bell rang to open the meeting. According to the agenda, they began to discuss proposals and elect directors and supervisors. After lunch, the ballots were counted again. It was not until 4:00 PM in the afternoon that the election results were announced. The details of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e111">Ceremony Order <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>1. Ring the bell to open the meeting. 2. All stand at attention. 3. Bow three times to the Party and National Flag and the portrait of the Prime Minister. 4. The chairman respectfully reads the Prime Minister's will. 5. Silence. 6. The chairman reports on the purpose of the meeting. 7. The preparatory committee reports on the preparation process. 8. Party and government representatives give instructions. 9. Guests speak. 10. Discuss the association's charter. 11. Discuss proposals. 12. Elect directors and supervisors. 13. Report the election results. All the staff at the meeting were tentatively nominated in advance by the preparatory committee. The presidium consisted of seven people: Zhang Shenzhi, Fang Jiaobo, Dai Yongting, Wu Zhenxin, Zhu Bao, Wu Xintai, Ge Liquan, and several people as master of ceremonies, recorders, and receptionists.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Various Reports <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>After performing the ceremony as required, Chairman Fang Jiaobo first reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying roughly that the city's fishermen and fish merchants have never had a unified organization. This time, in order to seek the welfare of the fishermen and fish merchants themselves, we have brought together fishermen, fish shops, and store merchants from all over the city to organize the City Fishery Association, which is of great significance, and so on. Then, Zhang Shenzhi, a member of the preparatory committee, reported on the preparation process, saying roughly that the city's fishermen and fish merchants initiated the organization of the City Fishery Association this time based on the Central Fishery Association Law, and appointed me and others to serve as members of the preparatory committee to handle all preparation matters. Because the procedures were more complicated, it has been a year since the preparation began. We have now solicited more than a thousand members and have reported to the party and government agencies for filing. Today, we are holding a formal inaugural meeting, and all previous preparations have come to an end, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Abstract of Instructions <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Lu Yinchu, representative of the Municipal Party Committee, gave instructions, saying roughly that China has always been an agricultural country, and fisheries are also an important part. Therefore, we should attach importance to fisheries. Today, the City Fishery Association is established in the city, and directors and supervisors will be elected. In the future, the relationship between all members and directors and supervisors should be close, so that they can exchange ideas, alleviate their own pain, and improve their own careers. Then, Wang Defa, representative of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, gave instructions, saying roughly that the length of China's coastline is much longer than that of Japan, but China's fishery market has been encroached upon by Japanese merchants. This is due to the backwardness of China's fishery technology. Therefore, in the future, under a unified organization, we should strive to improve China's fisheries so that hate goods cannot appear in China's fishery market. Next, Luo Zibao, representative of the Fisheries Bureau, gave instructions, saying roughly that the mission undertaken by the establishment of the City Fishery Association today is of great significance. Fisheries are a major production industry, and Shanghai is the center of the national production industry. Therefore, in the future, all our fishermen and fish merchants should seek the improvement of fisheries for the benefit of the entire nation. There were also speeches by Feng Limin, Principal of Wusong Fisheries School, and Wang Wentai, Director of Jiangsu Fisheries Experimental Farm, and others. The speeches were lengthy and are omitted here.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Wang Delin's Entry into Russia: <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Account of Anti-Japanese Situation</p>
<p>It is now known that Liang Yinshan, a special envoy from a certain military organization in Beiping, has returned to China after General Commander Wang Delin of the Jilin National Salvation Army retreated into Russian territory last month due to exhaustion of ammunition and lack of reinforcements. His report on Wang Delin's retreat into Russia is extremely detailed. The original text of his report is as follows (excerpted above): I was dispatched from Beiping on January 27th of this year and arrived in Qingdao on the 31st. On February 2nd, I took a boat to Dalian, and the next day, I arrived in Harbin. On the 5th, I arrived in Yimianpo and was slightly ill for several days. On the night of the 9th, I arrived at Bazhan (i.e., Maqiao River). On the 12th, I arrived at Suifenhe to investigate everything. I started my return journey on the 14th and returned to Beiping on the 21st. Now, I will list the situation at the front line as follows: General Commander Wang Delin was suddenly subjected to pressure and engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy at Wanlonggou, which belongs to the jurisdiction of Chezi County. The Japanese invaders suffered heavy casualties. It is rumored that the enemy side seized the bodies of officers and soldiers who died in battle, amounting to seventeen sleighs. Each sleigh could hold at least thirty bodies, so the number of deaths is obvious. Our army was attacked from above and below by the enemy's tanks and airplanes. With ammunition exhausted and no reinforcements, we had to retreat south to Dongning. We continued to resist at places such as Daxiao Wushaogou and Foyegou, holding on with flesh and blood. However, the snow in the mountains was several feet deep, and there was no suitable way out. After a fierce battle, the entire army carefully considered the advantages and disadvantages. The masses gathered and decided to force General Commander Wang to temporarily enter Russian territory in order to remove the target of the violent Japanese and to preserve our strength. In this environment, General Commander Wang led a small number of trusted cavalry and infantry units, as well as the families of generals and refugees, and retreated into the Shuangchengpu area of Russia on January 15th. Before departing, General Commander Wang emphasized local security and ordered Deputy Commander Kong Xianrong to lead strong troops to resist at the rear. Therefore, the people and merchants of Dongning did not suffer any losses. After General Commander Wang completely withdrew from the country, Deputy Commander Kong also entered Russia. Currently, all the troops in the Yanji and Dunhua areas are under the authority of Deputy Commander Wu Yicheng, who is acting as the commander-in-chief. Deputy Commander Wu and Staff Officer Li led the majority of the troops directly to Suifen Dadianzi, Huapidianzi, Nanbeichengzigou, and Daxiao Putaogou, through Zhuanjiaolou, taking the road through Chengzicun, Tongzigou, and reaching Songshuling, stationed at Nanhutou, in order to cut off the Japanese army's road from Dunhua to Mian. They are currently reorganizing their troops and actively planning a counterattack, as well as urgently destroying the Yan-Hui and Mudanjiang bank's Middle Eastern Railway tracks. Their momentum is more active than before. After this major stimulation, the soldiers' determination to kill the enemy and recover the land is even stronger. Those in the Hunchun and Wangqing areas are under the command of Deputy Commander Wang Yuzhen. The situation of the battle is unknown. It is also heard that Zhao Rongxian, the liaison officer sent by the rear, and Gao, the adjutant sent by Supervisor Wan to inspect the troops, have already gone to Russia with General Commander Wang. The whereabouts of other liaison officers, such as Liu Yichen, are still unknown. The various armies led by War Supervisor Zhang Yuting and Zheng Xing are still holding strategic locations in Muleng Liangzihe and Baicaogou, waiting for an opportunity to move. This is all the real situation.</p>

<p>Yesterday at around 5 PM, Li Pengfei, Detective No. 98 of the Yulin Road Police Station, received a tip that robbers would be passing through the intersection of Longjiang Road and Weituoma Road to commit robbery. After receiving the report, Li reported to the chief, who dispatched the entire squad of detectives to arrest them. As they approached Weituoma Road, four men suddenly appeared on the side of the road, acting suspiciously. Li knew they were not good people and prepared to go forward to search them. Unexpectedly, the robbers noticed them and, as the detectives attempted to arrest them, the robbers drew their guns and opened fire on the detectives. The detectives returned fire, and a fierce battle ensued. Bullets flew thick and fast, and they exchanged fire for about twenty rounds. One of the robbers was shot down first. When the remaining robbers saw this, they were terrified and were captured by the detectives in one fell swoop. Two handguns were confiscated and taken to the police station for safekeeping. The wounded robber was sent to the Municipal Council Hospital. It is reported that the robber's name is Zheng Dengcai, 28 years old, and he was shot seven times in the head, waist, right leg, right knee, left arm, left leg, and back. His injuries are quite serious. During the battle between the detectives and the robbers, a passerby was wounded by a stray bullet. The bullet passed through his left chest. The detectives sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, his injuries were minor and he is not in danger. It is also learned that the person's name is Liu Guoxun, 30 years old, from Funing, and he works as a salesman for the Jiuli Oil Company on Meizhou Road. He lives inside the No. 5 gate of the Shenxin Yarn Factory's workers' quarters on Meizhou Road.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Poisonous Snake Den Discovered in Qibao Town, Western Shanghai <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>A Total of Forty to Fifty Snakes</p>
<p>The Largest is More Than Five Feet Long</p>
<p>In Qibao Town, southwest of the Dasi Street in western Shanghai, there is a house inhabited by the Tang family. The northwest side of the house is surrounded by trees, vegetables, and other plants. Now that spring has arrived, they plan to turn over the garden soil and plant vegetables. The day before yesterday, while digging up dead trees and moving broken tiles, they suddenly discovered more than ten snakes, commonly known as "red-banded krait" and "ash viper". Yesterday, they saw eight or nine more. Today, as the moving and digging were nearing completion, they discovered a large pile of these snakes again, counting more than twenty. The largest was more than five feet long, and the smallest was more than one foot long. Because it was not yet the Jingzhe (Awakening of Insects) solar term, they were shaped like dead creatures but wriggling. The Tang family quickly killed them with iron hoes and burned them to prevent them from leaving poison. This matter spread throughout the town and was regarded as a strange event.</p>

<p>The Butcher Prepares to Slaughter</p>
<p>The Detective Steps Forward to Stop Him</p>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, at dawn, the Lida Carriage Company at 176 Maybelle Avenue was broken into by a thief who stole two fat horses from the stables. It was not discovered until dawn, and the horses were nowhere to be found. The day before yesterday, Zhang Chengtang, the owner of the company, happened to be passing through the French Concession when he encountered the horse thief, Li Afu. He immediately called the police and brought Li to the Xinzha Police Station. According to Li's confession, the two horses were sold to a certain cattle slaughterer at 4117 Jiaotong Road in Zhabei. The police dispatched Detective Ma Zhongrong and Detective Xia Yeshan to investigate. The butcher was just preparing to slaughter the horses when he was stopped. The two horses were immediately taken back and returned to the owner, and Li was detained by the police station to await interrogation by the court.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Salary Reduction Dispute at the Grains Exchange <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Between Seventy and Ninety Percent</p>
<p>Due to poor business, the Shanghai Grains, Oil, and Cake Exchange has been paying its employees only seventy percent of their original salaries since January of last year, causing dissatisfaction among the employees. They all believed that the exchange had not yet suffered losses and should not reduce salaries. Therefore, they requested several times without success and petitioned various party and government agencies for mediation. The Social Bureau recently summoned representatives from both labor and management for mediation, but the management claimed that due to sluggish business, paying seventy percent of the salary was a last resort. However, the labor side argued that although business had declined last year, there was still a surplus, and salaries should not be discounted. The two sides remained deadlocked and the issue was not resolved. It is now learned that after mediation by someone, the exchange's board of directors discussed the salaries of the employees again and again and decided to pay eighty-five percent of the original salaries. The salaries will be restored to their original levels after the business recovers. It is heard that some people on the employee side also made some concessions and requested to receive ninety percent of the salary as a temporary measure. If the business is booming, the deducted salaries will be compensated in full. After the mediator's explanation, the matter should be resolved soon.</p>

<p>Miss Chen Er Sold to Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Then Abducted Again to Shanghai for Sale</p>
<p>The World is Full of Dangers, and Some People Have the Hearts of Beasts</p>
<p>Chen Er, a woman from Taixing, is 29 years old. She lost her father early in life and depended on her elderly mother and sister for a living. Although she was betrothed to Lou Haiqing, a neighbor, Lou was wandering in Zhenjiang and had no ability to marry her, causing her youth to be wasted. The woman was quite depressed. On January 22nd of this year, two men, Lu and Wang, secretly went to the woman's house, claiming that they had been entrusted by Lou Haiqing to invite her to Zhenjiang for the wedding. Chen Er did not have time to distinguish the truth and followed them without telling her mother and sister. When they arrived in Jingkou, Lu and Wang sold her to a brothel run by the Chen family in that area. These people received 350 yuan for her body and escaped with the money. From then on, Chen Er engaged in a life of prostitution, welcoming new customers and seeing off old ones, becoming everyone's wife. After a month, she met a patron named Li Arong, who, during a lull in the drinking and revelry, inquired about her background. Chen Er told him everything. Li then compared himself to an ancient bailiff, saying that he would definitely rescue her from the pit of fire and send her back to her hometown. Even if she could not reunite with her fiancé, he would still reunite her with her mother. Chen Er, seeing his righteousness, did not suspect anything and escaped from the brothel on February 24th, running away with Li. Unexpectedly, Li Arong was also one of Lu and Wang's type, thinking that this lonely and helpless woman was easy to deceive. After deceiving her,</p>

<h3 id="e131">The Zhengtai Factory Disaster has been Reported to the Social Bureau <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>A Compensation of 300 Yuan for Each Deceased Worker</p>
<p>Seventy-One of the Eighty-One Families Have Already Received It</p>
<p>Since the disastrous incident at the Shanghai Zhengtai Rubber Factory, the factory has been handling the aftermath. Yesterday, they also submitted a report to the Social Bureau on the circumstances of the disaster for record-keeping. The original report is as follows: Reporting on the circumstances of the disastrous accident at our factory, as well as the handling of the aftermath, requesting review and approval, etc. In response to Order No. Shezi 9121, within, etc. (excerpted), This order, etc. In response, we found that our factory suffered an unfortunate accident at 9:30 AM on the 21st of last month. We were about to investigate and report in accordance with the Factory Law, but due to the extraordinary nature of the incident and the magnitude of the disaster, the number of deaths and injuries was not easy to investigate for a while, resulting in a delay. The reason for the cylinder explosion that day was that the electrical wire behind the steam cylinder in the southern part of our factory short-circuited, igniting the paint oil drums nearby. The oil was flammable, so after the fire started, all ten or so drums of paint oil burned at the same time. The temperature rose sharply, and the four boilers connected to the paint oil, including one large and one small, were filled with air. Affected by the extremely high temperature outside, the air pressure increased and exploded one after another. The entire factory collapsed, and the sound of the explosions shook the sky. It was unbearable to witness. Seventy-five female workers and six male workers died in the disaster, a total of eighty-one people. Three male workers and fifteen female workers are still being treated in the hospital, a total of eighteen people. The bodies of all eighty-one deceased male and female workers have been examined by the court and sent to the Pushan Villa for burial. Our factory deeply mourns the deceased workers and has purchased coffins, silk bedding, and silk floss for the burial. The coffins were temporarily placed in the hospital and then transported to Shanghai by the Beijing-Shanghai train and temporarily placed in the Zhonghua Hotel on Jielu Road. Li then went around looking for a buyer. On the 27th of last month, Li Arong entrusted Li Erda of Changzhou to sell her, and Li Erda led his accomplice, Shen Xiaosan of Jiangbei, to pretend to be the woman's husband in order to facilitate the sale. After several days of running around, a man named Wang Baobao wanted to buy the woman. Li and others then invited Wang and Wang's friend, Yang Axin, to the Zhonghua Hotel to negotiate. Shen Xiaosan, the woman's fake husband, asked for 400 yuan. Unexpectedly, the matter was heard by detectives Wang Xichang and Yang Xinzheng of the Jingansi Road Police Station, who rushed to the hotel to arrest them the day before yesterday. Li Erda and Shen Xiaosan were arrested on the spot, but Li Arong had already escaped in advance. The detectives then escorted the two traffickers and Chen Er, who had been abducted repeatedly, to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation. Although Chen Er is a country girl, she is naturally beautiful. Even in a black cotton jacket and pants, she cannot hide her natural beauty. Those who saw her said that with such beauty, it is no wonder that she was repeatedly lured by traitors while alone outside. At that time, the police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the defendants had abducted a woman from a good family, sold her into prostitution, and then abducted her again for sale, which was a heinous crime, and requested that they be severely punished. After the woman detailed the circumstances of the abduction, Judge Wu Tingqi questioned the two defendants, Li Erda and Shen Xiaosan, and the witness, Wang Baobao, one by one, and ordered the defendants to be detained. The woman was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<p>The Jiangyin Guild Hall has purchased four mu of land in Datang to build a public cemetery for the workers who died in the disaster to comfort their souls. The factory's board of directors has also repeatedly discussed the issue of compensation for the families of the deceased workers and has decided to provide a compensation of 300 yuan per family. Seventy-one families have already come to the factory to collect it, and the rest will be paid as soon as they collect it. The factory will continue to pay the male workers who escaped the disaster their original salaries to maintain their livelihoods. Those who wish to return to their hometowns will be given travel expenses. After the factory's machinery is repaired, they will be notified to return to work. The female workers who escaped the disaster will be transferred to the factory's second factory as soon as possible to avoid unemployment. All of the above is a general overview of the efforts made by our factory to handle the aftermath. Rubber manufacturing has been suffering from the encroachment of Japanese goods for years, and business has plummeted. Since the January 28th Incident last year, the damage has been even greater. All businesses in this industry are on the verge of collapse. Our factory suffered a major disaster this time, making it even more difficult to sustain itself. However, we believe that the workers sacrificed their lives in the line of duty, which is very regrettable. Therefore, we have been working hard to handle the aftermath and compensation matters, hoping to live up to our conscience. In accordance with the order, we have submitted a report on the disaster and the handling of the aftermath. We hope that you will review and approve it for the benefit of the public. Respectfully submitted to Wu, Director of the Shanghai Social Bureau.</p>

<p>Sent Staff to Investigate, but the Company Refused</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce announced that it had received a letter from the General Affairs Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters, stating that it had been reported that Hengfeng Hardware Company, located at No. 9 Jingjiang Lane, Catholic Church Street, French Concession, had smuggled hundreds of boxes of hostile goods and liquor. The Chamber of Commerce sent staff to the company at the address to meet with a Yan, who was in charge of accounting, and told him the purpose of their visit. Unexpectedly, Yan panicked upon hearing this and stammered, then claimed that the manager was out and he dared not make a decision on his own. Finally, he said that even if there were smuggled hostile goods, there was no need to argue. The Chamber of Commerce then explained the stakes to him repeatedly, but Yan refused the investigation, saying that he would let them handle it and would never accept it. The Chamber of Commerce believes that the company has something to hide and should disclose the investigation to draw public attention.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Ministry of Industry Instructs Municipal Chambers of Commerce to Promote Industrial Standardization <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Regulations on Methods of Recording Information on Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received Instruction No. 6181 from the Ministry of Industry, stating that the National Bureau of Weights and Measures reported that industrial standardization is closely related to the unification of weights and measures. Taking the item of recording quantities on goods as an example, many countries have explicit legal provisions, and our country has also adopted some, but they are not very common, and they mostly use various complex weights and measures of other countries or old systems, which have no prospect of unification and cause many obstacles. Now, three preliminary measures are drafted as follows: (1) For goods that are easy to record quantities, the quantity should be clearly recorded on the original product or its packaging when leaving the factory, such as the length and width of a piece of cloth. (2) The quantity marked on the goods shall not exceed the actual quantity. For example, if a box of biscuits actually weighs one catty, it shall not be marked as more than one catty on the box. (3) The measurement of goods shall be based on the new system of weights and measures and shall not misuse the old system or foreign weights and measures. The above-mentioned three preliminary measures, if implemented nationwide, will be of some benefit to the unification of weights and measures. Whether they are feasible, it is appropriate to submit a document for review and compliance. If approved, it is proposed to issue a notice to all chambers of commerce and trade associations across the country to comply accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Wenzhou Fellow Townsmen Association Calls for Aftermath Arrangements After the Taishun Mutiny <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Taishun Mutiny incident, the Wenzhou Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association yesterday telegraphed the Military Affairs Commission, General Commander Jiang, and the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, urging them to send personnel to conduct on-site investigations promptly, punish responsible military officers, and properly arrange local aftermath measures to calm the people's hearts. It also telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government to promptly dispatch special commissioners to implement emergency relief and comfort the affected masses. Excerpts of the association's original telegrams to the Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government are as follows: (Titles omitted) Repeatedly received telegrams from all French churches in Taishun, stating that on January 25th, all officers and soldiers of the First and Second Battalions of the First Regiment of the Twenty-first Division stationed in the territory mutinied, searching every household, burning, killing, raping, and doing everything possible. They destroyed party headquarters and institutions, detained the county magistrate and public officials, and extorted huge sums of money. On the 28th, they led the masses to Baimao Hongkou in the county, and after looting, they burned the streets to the ground. Then, they fled back to the county seat, where the burning and killing were even worse than before. Many people died from bullets. Later, after Liu Shi Zhao Brigade Commander pacified them, they led the masses to Pingyang on February 3rd, and the disaster of the mutiny subsided. This time, the mutinous soldiers occupied the county seat for as long as nine days, and all parts of the countryside were looted without exception. More than 200 households were destroyed in the county seat of Baimao Hongkou, with a total loss of no less than one million. About 30 soldiers, police, and civilians were killed or injured. The amount of cash extorted was about 20,000 yuan. Regiment Commander Chen Xiao was incompetent in managing his subordinates, indulged in disturbing the people, and failed to make plans to defend the territory in the face of rampant bandits, resulting in this major mutiny. Now, the local area is desolate, worse than a disaster area, and the victims are calling for help but have no way to seek assistance. We urgently request your commission to promptly submit a request for the issuance of emergency relief for military disasters, strictly order Liu Shi to compensate for the losses, and punish the mutinous officers and soldiers, to save the remaining lives and punish the wicked. Upon approval, we have learned that Taishun is a barren land with poor people, and it has suffered from banditry repeatedly, and its vitality has not yet recovered. This time, Liu Shi was transferred to Zhejiang to guard against the suppression of Jiangxi bandits, but he failed to fulfill his duty to defend the territory, resulting in harming the local area. Alas, the people of Taiyi, how can they bear this catastrophe? The people in all the neighboring counties are even more terrified and restless at the sight of this mutiny. According to the aforementioned telegram, it is appropriate to telegraph to your excellency, asking you to conduct an on-site investigation in Taishun promptly, punish the responsible military officers, and telegraph the local government to prepare for emergency relief and properly arrange for the aftermath to appease the local area and comfort the people's hearts, which is extremely urgent. Another telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government stated, (Omitted above) It has been learned that Taiyi is a barren land with poor people, and it has suffered from banditry repeatedly, and its vitality has not yet recovered. This time, it has suffered a great catastrophe again, and the losses are so great that it will be difficult to restore the original state in several decades. Therefore, according to the situation, we urgently request your government to promptly dispatch special commissioners to implement emergency relief and provide comfort to the affected masses to comfort the wronged souls and appease the local area.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Overview of War Damage to the Law School <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Total Loss Exceeds 430,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Law School in Jiangwan was bombed by the violent Japanese army during the January 28th Shanghai Incident. The losses suffered during the national crisis have been ascertained and compiled into [Overview of Losses of Shanghai Law School in the National Crisis]. The construction of buildings, equipment, and books totaled 303,580 yuan. The private losses [such as faculty, staff, and students] of bedding, luggage, books, works, daily necessities, etc., totaled 130,710 yuan. Ten photos of the destroyed school buildings, dormitories, auditoriums, and classrooms were taken and explained. The school was founded in the summer of 1926, initially named Shanghai Law University, renting private houses on Pubo Road in the French Concession as lecture halls. Zhang Binglin and Dong Kang served as presidents and vice presidents, respectively. Before long, Zhang resigned and organized a board of directors in accordance with the law, electing Chu Fucheng as chairman, and Dong Kang and Pan Dadao as vice chairmen. In 1927, Pan was assassinated, and Dong also resigned. Qian Yongming was re-elected as chairman, and Chu as president, and Shen Junru as dean of academic affairs, and continued to run the school, striving for improvement. The number of students increased, and the school buildings were insufficient. Therefore, in August 1928, the school moved to Jiangwan Road in Zhabei, with a total area of 15 mu. The classroom dormitory archway was completed in 1929 and could accommodate 1,500 people. The lecture halls and dormitories were divided into 47 rooms and could accommodate 300 people. In 1930, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Education, the school was renamed Shanghai Private Law School. In the winter of that year, it was approved for registration. In the spring of 1931, a large auditorium was added. The above situation was carefully managed over the years, and the total amount of school funds reached 400,000 yuan. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by the violent Japanese army on January 28th, and everything was reduced to ashes. The School had organized a restoration committee and plans to raise 100,000 yuan. It is currently engaged in repairs. Once the school buildings are repaired, all the students of the school can move back to Jiangwan Road from Yaozhu Road.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Marriage Problem <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Inquiry from Ms. Luo Shuqing</p>
<p>I am eighteen years old this year and grew up in an old-fashioned family. I only studied in a private school for one year. My parents are very conservative and afraid that I will be influenced by new trends, so they do not allow me to go to school. All day long, I am confined to my deep and closed cage. Reading the newspaper is how I study.</p>
<p>The reader’s answers to questions all make me admire them to the point of prostration. I also ask you to give me guidance on the difficult problem I sigh about every day. When I was twelve years old, my parents made a match for me with the son of a wealthy man in a deep rural area. At that time, I was ignorant and of course did not object. Later, as my knowledge gradually improved, I realized that marriage was my biggest problem. I paid attention to inquiring about everything about my fiancé and also met him. He is not yet twenty years old and is already a drunkard, drinking alcohol before every meal. He is still asking an eight-legged essay teacher to teach him the Classic of Poetry and ancient texts at home. Can that be useful? I live in the city and have been slightly influenced by newspapers and magazines. Frankly speaking, I am unwilling to marry someone who is neither a farmer nor a worker and who sits and eats up his ancestors’ inheritance. I would rather die! There is a man next door to me who is about the same age as me. Although his situation is humble, he can be said to have a noble personality. I have been paying attention to him for more than a year, and all his habits are just like my ideals. We sometimes meet, and we are both very shy. There is no need to say that we admire each other. One day, I received a letter without a head or tail. I guess it was written by him. Since then, we have corresponded frequently. I have also had a few dangerous encounters where I talked to him in the park, and we are even more in harmony. It is hateful that although I want to deny this purely despotic marriage contract and break away from this unproductive and incompatible fiancé, I cannot express my private thoughts to my parents in such a corrupt family. It is impossible for them to grant my wishes. My future is extremely hopeless. I heard that my husband’s family will soon be looking for a date to marry me, which is tantamount to my death date approaching. Mr. Chang said that suicide is absolutely not allowed. If I marry into a remote rural town, I will be extorting blood and sweat from a wealthy man, and I will break off my friendship with my friends. I feel that life is worse than death. Only Mr. Mist Haina Zhen, please show me the answer. Answer: The handwriting of the lady’s letter is beautiful and the writing is clear and coherent. It is naturally impossible to have this achievement after studying in a private school for one year. Rather, it is the result of the lady having a remarkable talent and the virtue of self-study. Admirable, admirable! However, it is distressing to see such a determined and eager-to-learn woman being bound by an old-fashioned family and suffering from unfree marriage, and it is even hateful that I have no power to actively help the lady! For the sake of the lady... the first step is to try to persuade your father and mother to ask them to let you come out to study... But for the time being, you must not express your intention to refuse marriage, just say that you will talk about it after you return from studying... If they agree to your request, then there will be a way for the second step. After you arrive in Shanghai, study hard for a year, or work a little harder and help your lover study. You must not get married immediately or have further relations with him; because you do not know how to prevent childbirth, if other results occur, then not only will you have no joy to enjoy in the future, but you will also suffer. After a year, you will both have a little foundation outside, and then write a letter to tell them the reason why you cannot be engaged to the wealthy man's son, and ask them to forgive you. Perhaps they will not be stubborn, otherwise, if you really love each other, then you should leave your family and work in the factory, live independently, and help each other. Although it is a little hard in terms of material things, you can get some compensation in spirit. The marriage problem is one of the modern social problems. If the social problem is not fundamentally solved, this problem will not be solved satisfactorily. The opinions we offer are also a last resort, and it depends on the lady's efforts!</p>

<p>Ding Shaoxian, a native of Zhaiqi Town, Hangzhou, is 36 years old this year. He was engaged in the paper business and worked at Kang Dingchang Shop in Zhoupu Town, Nanhui County, Pudong. He has a wife and children at home. Recently, he used the funds in the shop and was dismissed by the manager and came to Shanghai, intending to find another place to live. Unfortunately, he could not find a place. On the evening of the 3rd, he checked into Room 18 of the Huatong Inn, No. 381, Aiduya Road, French Concession, under the assumed name of Ding Yuyu. He stayed until the evening of the 4th. Because he could not find a job, he was stimulated for a while and had a momentary thought. He secretly swallowed raw opium and committed suicide. By yesterday, it was already past noon. The teaboy, Wang Yu, saw that he had not yet gotten up, so at 1:00 p.m., he knocked on the door as usual, asking if the room was needed. He knocked on the door and called for a long time, but there was no response in the room. He knew that something had happened, so he pried open the door and went in to check. Ding had already died in bed, his body was as cold as ice. He immediately reported to the French Police Station, which sent a detective to investigate. A suicide note was found on the deceased, with two letters, one addressed to his younger brother Ding Xiuchang, instructing him to take care of his wife and children, and one entrusted to his teacher, the owner of Kang Dingchang, saying that the funds were lost due to being harmed by others, and he was now forced to commit suicide. The body was sent to the Tongren Foyuantang autopsy site and reported to the court for examination today.</p>

<p>The Ningbo Road China Jishenghui in this port constantly distributes various essential medicines, all of which require huge sums of money. They are sincerely prepared, so each has a spiritual effect, especially the gynecological Jishenghui Deshengshen Dan, which is in the greatest demand. Most poor women suffer from chest tightness, abdominal distension, back pain, waist soreness, and menstrual disorders due to sorrow, depression, and anger. Taking this Dan can calm the liver, soothe qi, nourish blood, regulate menstruation, and treat various strange diseases. The association entrusted Hu Qingyutang to prepare this Dan sincerely, using high-quality raw materials and matching them carefully. The hall also intends to save the world, charging low prices to fulfill its obligations and provide assistance to poor women who are unable to afford it. Now, at the beginning of spring, women suffering from the above-mentioned diseases can obtain it from the association free of charge. Furthermore, the aforementioned diseases have become common problems in the women's world, and they are closely related to fertility. Therefore, caring people should widely persuade women to calm down and restore the national spirit, which is also the association's sincere hope.</p>

<p>Central and Western Radio Station Explains "Heavenly Rain of Flowers" Central and Western Radio Station Since its opening, it has been widely praised and is considered to be unique. Moreover, the programs broadcast are very beneficial to society, such as medical and musical Q&amp;A, current affairs reports, etc., and there is absolutely no involvement in entertainment.

<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>What Shanghai feels particularly lacking and urgently needs to promote is infectious disease hospitals. According to the current situation, there are only a few hospitals that specialize in treating dangerous infectious diseases, such as meningitis, scarlet fever, and smallpox. The Public Concession's Public Works Department has an isolation hospital, but the Chinese department inside is really not praised by the Chinese. Therefore, patients are terrified when they hear that they are going to the Public Works Department Hospital. The French Concession's Guangci Hospital has a separate Chenli Hospital Department. However, the system is very biased and isolated from other medical circles. And it is not very convenient to only accept residents of the French Concession. The Shanghai Municipal Shanghai Hospital in Nanshi also has considerable isolation beds during the epidemic period of the above-mentioned diseases, but the houses there are too unsuitable. Collecting too many dangerous cases will hinder other wards. There used to be a public hospital in Zhabei, which was run by the Chinese. It specialized in receiving such symptoms. The location and architecture were very good, and the qualifications were the oldest, but the medical affairs were completely contracted by a foreigner, which was somewhat inconsistent with the new academic theory. For example, scarlet fever does not allow much blood serum to be injected, and the throat is smeared with medicine every day, which often makes the patient sit up, regardless of the danger of the heart. These are all I have witnessed with my own eyes. Now, after the war in Zhabei, the hospital has also been hit. In addition, the Red Cross Society has been intermittent in the operation of isolation hospitals, and the Health Bureau has no funds to open them, so開業physicians are most hesitant when diagnosing such diseases, persuading patients to send them to the above-mentioned hospitals. They are mostly unwilling. If they are sent to other wards, they will be rejected. Listen to them being treated at home. It is greatly inconsistent with the principles of public health, and especially violates the responsibilities of a proper doctor. Therefore, enthusiastic doctors, regardless of whether the patient is willing or not, report to the Public Works Department and forcibly take the patient away. Slightly passive doctors follow the patient's requirements and take a great risk to treat him at home with the business experience of daily visits. The most passive doctors completely abandon this patient, let him eat immortal prescriptions or soup heads, and ignore whether he infects others. The so-called major infectious diseases in Shanghai are also流行流行 under this畸形 medicine, rising and falling with the weather. The Public Works Department actually publishes a report in the newspaper every week, saying that there are so many cases of smallpox and so many cases of scarlet fever. Where is the auditable exact number? It can be said that all those who eat immortal prescriptions, invite otolaryngologists, and apply plasters are completely not included. It is not easy to investigate even deaths. However, assuming that all cases are sent to isolation hospitals in accordance with legal procedures, I am afraid that the above-mentioned hospitals will be overcrowded. This situation should be worthy of attention by thoughtful people in society.</p>
<p>Next, let’s talk about cholera hospitals, commonly known as epidemic hospitals, which are popular in summer. Most of the cholera patients are civilians and laborers, so the way of running such hospitals is often like giving free clinics, in a charitable way. However, cholera is not limited to civilians, and middle-class merchants, high officials and wealthy businessmen also suffer from cholera if they are not careful in their diet, so the difficulty of hospitalization arises. If you say that高等sanatoriums or private hospitals accept cholera, it is actually somewhat illegal. If you say that you live in the same room with peddlers and pawnbrokers, it is also something that the upper class people do not want. Although there are several epidemic hospitals with first- and second-class chargeable rooms, unfortunately they are temporary and things are very chaotic, and the first- and second-class are not well-studied. There are patients who say to the people in the epidemic hospital: "I would rather pay more hospital fees, please treat and care for me more authentically." However, everyone in the hospital can only reply: "There are many people and things here, so we have to treat everyone equally." In your self-governing epidemic hospital, especially the completely free clinic nature, we cannot accept half a cent no matter how much he is willing to pay, and there is really nothing authentic about nursing supplies. Therefore, I think that in Shanghai, during the annual cholera epidemic, it may be appropriate to adapt to the actual needs and organize one or two more advanced epidemic hospitals, with complete disinfection equipment, proper nursing medicine, and higher charges. There is no need for too many beds, only for the use of the property-owning class who occasionally suffer from cholera (that is, dysentery can also be accepted and retained), so as to avoid the other ordinary hospitals being disturbed by those infectious patients, and to avoid many patients filling the family alleys with infectious excrement because they are afraid of entering ordinary epidemic hospitals.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Talking About Hemoptysis <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>Hemoptysis is a symptom, not a disease. Generally speaking, people think that hemoptysis is tuberculosis (meaning pulmonary tuberculosis). In fact, there are many causes of hemoptysis. Tuberculosis is just one of the causes. Even in terms of the blood that is coughed up, some comes from the lungs, some comes directly from the heart, some comes from the stomach, and some comes from the throat, nasal cavity, and oral cavity. All must be distinguished and diagnosed, and cannot be confused. Moreover, the blood that comes from the lungs is not necessarily caused by tuberculosis. For example, if the lungs have syphilis, hemoptysis can occur. If the pulmonary trachea expands and ruptures, hemoptysis can occur. If the pulmonary blood vessels are blocked by blood clots (the main cause is heart disease), hemoptysis can also occur. If the lungs suffer from actinomycosis or carbuncle, hemoptysis can occur. If the lungs suffer from cysticercosis or Paragonimus disease (also known as lung fluke, the symptoms of which are very similar to tuberculosis), there is even the possibility of hemoptysis. If a woman has retrograde menstruation, or if the aortic aneurysm ruptures into the pulmonary trachea, the blood can also be coughed up from the pulmonary trachea. I remember that a certain patient suddenly coughed up blood. The doctor diagnosed it as tuberculosis and even took an X-ray photograph as proof. Later, after repeated treatment, it was not cured. After careful diagnosis, it was found to be heart disease. The X-ray photograph of a patient with heart disease can sometimes be very similar to tuberculosis and other diseases. As for the blood coughed up from the stomach, it is not all caused by stomach diseases. For example, if the liver is atrophied, the blood will be blocked in the lower part of the esophagus and the stomach. If there is an opportunity, bleeding can occur. The blood gushes up and is hemoptysis. The blood vessels of old people are easily hardened. After the blood vessels of the stomach are hardened, it is also very easy to bleed. The blood accumulates in the stomach mostly and is coughed up. Also, people with typhoid fever or appendicitis sometimes also cough up blood. Other causes such as blood vessel embolism in the intestine, malignant lymphoma, or jaundice can also be the cause of hemoptysis. As for the nose, oral cavity, throat, etc., sometimes due to various reasons, bleeding can occur due to wounds. Those who do not know think it is bleeding from the lungs or stomach. I remember when I was in Germany, I saw a woman suffering from a nervous disorder who came to the lung department seeking treatment for hemoptysis. After repeated examinations, it was not known where the blood came from. However, the sputum bowl on the table was filled with blood every morning. Later, after a secret investigation by the night shift nurse, it was found that the blood she coughed up was caused by her specially piercing her gums with a hair needle. All of this is endless. If it is said that hemoptysis is tuberculosis, wouldn't it be angry? Therefore, if a doctor encounters a patient coughing up blood, if there is any doubt, he must carefully diagnose and distinguish the cause of the disease, and prescribe the right medicine, then it will be effective. And if a patient suffers from hemoptysis, there is no need to panic too much. Don't think that it is tuberculosis and be disheartened. It is best to ask the doctor to carefully diagnose. As for the method of differentiating and diagnosing hemoptysis, it is quite complicated. Sometimes X-ray examination is required, sometimes microscopic examination is required, sometimes serum examination is required, and sometimes chemical examination is required. There are many kinds. I will not list them all. If I have time in the future, I will write a detailed explanation. However, regarding the above-mentioned examination, it is best to be able to implement it yourself. Sometimes, when encountering critically ill patients who must be examined, it is impossible to delay the time.</p>
<p>Since the causes of hemoptysis are as complicated as described above, the main treatment drugs also vary with the disease, and cannot be confined to one prescription. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e162">A Humble Opinion on Preventing Meningitis <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yaobai</p>
<p>(I) The Course of the Epidemic</p>
<p>Meningitis was formerly only an occasional epidemic. Since the European War, it has transformed into a large-scale epidemic. According to the records of the Journal of the American Medical Association, the great epidemic of this disease began after the European War. It was first discovered in Austria in 1917, and then spread from west to east, from France to England. In 1919, it reached the Americas. In the spring of 1920, Shanghai newspapers reported that the disease was found in Shanghai, thus it crossed the Pacific Ocean and reached China. Subsequently, it spread from Shanghai along the railway lines to various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. This can be traced on a map. In March of that year, I was in Changzhou. When it was first discovered, I translated and published the articles from the American Medical Journal in various newspapers for colleagues to study and verify. Since then, between the winter and spring of each year, there has been an epidemic of this disease. In recent years, it has been particularly prevalent, with Jiangnan and western Zhejiang being the main areas of occurrence. This is probably due to the convenience of transportation and the rapid dissemination of information, hence the increased awareness.</p>
<p>(II) Variations in Symptoms</p>
<p>The common symptoms of this disease are fever, headache, vomiting, and gradually stiff neck muscles, leading to opisthotonos. However, there are also many exceptional and unusual symptoms that are easily mistaken. For example, when this disease was first seen in rural Huzhou, patients only complained of slight headaches, without fever or convulsions. Examination of their cerebrospinal fluid showed it to be very clear. However, shortly afterwards, purple spots appeared all over their bodies. A further examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed a large number of bacteria. From the onset of the disease to death, it took only a dozen hours. Also, there was a child in Hangzhou, only eight months old, whose fontanelle was swollen. The family suspected it was a seasonal illness and requested an examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. No bacteria were found, but the child became seriously ill and died. The family agreed to a post-mortem examination to find out what happened. The results showed that the meninges were indeed inflamed. Meningitis, as seen in Jiaxing, initially presented with vomiting and diarrhea, very similar to cholera, but bacteria could be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore, doctors and patients should be aware of this when encountering suspicious symptoms.</p>
<p>(III) Opinions on Prevention and Treatment</p>
<p>(A) There are various preventive methods. However, the most effective is the injection of meningitis vaccine. However, it must be administered early, before the epidemic occurs. Each vaccination needs to be done every week for three weeks to give a full immune response. Thus, it is advisable to promote vaccination in winter or early spring to prevent problems before they arise. If you have already been in contact with a patient, then serum should be used as a preventative injection. The Huzhou Health Association vaccinated more than 4,000 people in urban and rural areas with the preventative vaccine and none of them were infected. In a certain hospital, more than a hundred employees were given preventative injections. Unexpectedly, three nurses later contracted the disease. Upon investigation, it was found that they had not received preventative injections due to some reason. This is a very powerful counter-proof. The epidemic was particularly severe in Changzhou last year. A temporary preventative vaccination program was initiated, and it was later divided into two areas, north and south. I was in charge of the Gospel Hospital in the northern district. A total of more than 3,000 people were vaccinated and none of those vaccinated were subsequently infected. (B) Treatment - Meningitis serum is, of course, the only specific drug for this disease. What should be noted is that the earlier it is used, the better. When the disease is prevalent, meningitis serum can be used for intramuscular injection when similar illnesses are encountered, often taking the initiative and eliminating the disease before it takes hold. If one must wait until bacteria are found in the spinal fluid examination before using it, it often leads to mistakes. This is because there are often cases where the initial examination shows no bacteria. The patient deteriorates after a few hours. A second spinal fluid examination shows there are many bacteria. Treatment may then be too late. Also, if spinal fluid injections alone are not very effective, intravenous injections can be used in conjunction with them, which may be more beneficial.</p>
<p>(IV) Origin of Serum</p>
<p>Regarding the origin of serum and vaccines, there is an important fact that should be brought to the special attention of Chinese people. The common view is that imported goods are more exquisite and superior to domestically produced goods. However, in the case of serum or vaccines for treating infectious diseases, the opposite is true. According to the results of experiments in various mission hospitals, domestically produced serum and vaccines are actually far more effective than imported goods. Some initially thought that this was simply because the products were fresher. However, according to Dr. Xi Youkang's opinion, it is due to the types of bacteria. It was also discovered that in the European War. Soldiers came from all over the world. Serum and other medicines were also collected and concentrated from various places and distributed for use. Unexpectedly, when serum from country A was used to treat patients from country B, the effect was greatly reduced. After repeated research, it was realized that if the bacterial strains used to manufacture the serum were taken from people of the same region, the types would be more similar, and the attacking effect would be greater. I obtained this discovery while collecting treatment results for meningitis. I must report this to the Chinese people. I also hope that domestic institutions that manufacture serum and vaccines will continue to improve the quality of their products to meet the needs of the Chinese people.</p>

<p>— Yugong</p>
<p>The Japanese pirates are invading more and more. The nation's lifeline is hanging by a thread. Tracing the origin of the disaster, it is none other than the unequal treaties that have led to this. Because of the unequal treaties, the Japanese are able to openly deploy troops and generals within our country, seeking opportunities to start trouble and create the Mukden Incident, the Shanghai War, and the Battle of Shanhaiguan. Now, a large army is pressing down on our borders, invading Rehe, destroying our defenses, and peeking into our heartland. They all rely on the unequal treaties as a protective talisman. The unequal treaties are the prelude to our country's demise. And the signing of various unequal treaties originated from the Opium War in the 20th year of Daoguang (1840). The opium problem is a matter of life and death for our country and must be described. Opium in England is also known as Opium, which is the most useful medicine and also the most harmful medicine. The word Opium comes from the Greek word Ｏpion, meaning juice. In those days, the juice of plants that could be used for medicinal purposes was called Opion. Later, because poppy flower juice was more effective than the juice of other plants, Opion specifically referred to poppy flower juice. When the world's people learned of the medicinal value of poppy flower juice, very few people knew. The founder of Western medicine, Hippocrates (460-372 BC), knew that its leaves could be used for food, but did not know its medicinal effect. The first person to discover its hypnotic use was Tarentun (240 BC). In the first century, Dioscorides began to make clear records of the medicinal efficacy of opium and the method of collecting opium. However, the reputation of opium was not very prominent at the time. Some people even held opposing views. The most famous pharmacist, Galen, still regarded opium as an extremely dangerous substance and should not be used lightly. As a result, the efficacy of opium was buried for thousands of years. It was not until Felix Platter came out in 1536-1614 that he broke the prejudice and promoted its efficacy. In 1669, the British physician Sydenham made opium into wine, which is still used today. However, the person who made a great contribution to opium was Serturoer in 1815, who proposed the alkali. This alkali is named Morpheum to commemorate the god of dreams, Morpheus. The method of collecting opium is to make a number of scratches on the outer skin of the fruit with a knife at night when the dew is down. The depth of the scratches is very important. If the scratches are too deep, the opium juice may be lost. Within 24 hours, the collector must go to the field to carefully scrape off the flowing juice and place it in a plate. Then, the dried juice is packed into round blocks. This is the opium sold on the market. The first time opium came to China was in the ninth century. At that time, a Western doctor named Moors used it to treat dysentery and it was quite effective. At the end of the 17th century, Chinese people began to smoke it. Who started it is unknown. According to rumors, it was either the Persians or the Turks. They initially mixed opium with tobacco leaves and smoked it. The method was spread to China, where the Chinese made special equipment and used a pipe to pick and smoke it. Then, they only smoked opium and did not mix it with tobacco leaves. The initial amount of opium imported into China was very small. In 1787, the British East India Company established an opium depot near Hong Kong, which greatly increased the transportation of opium. The number of smokers increased day by day. Chinese people became addicted to smoking, which led to weakness and waste. The Chinese government had no choice but to take strict measures. In 1796, it issued an edict prohibiting smoking. In 1820, it prohibited opium ships from entering Guangzhou, which led to the Opium War in 1840. As a result, China was defeated miserably. In 1842, the Treaty of Nanjing was concluded, opening five ports for trade. From then on, the transportation of opium to China was no longer a prohibited item. Since then, various unequal treaties have continued to be signed. The powers have used various unequal treaties as tools to invade China. The cause of today's national crisis is the unequal treaties. The cause of the unequal treaties is opium. Opium, opium, you are really the vanguard of imperialism.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>Q: Is measles prevention dangerous to life?</p>
<p>A: Not dangerous. The mortality rate is roughly 3%. It can be seen that infants and children with weak constitutions are relatively more at risk.</p>
<p>Q: What is the general treatment for measles?</p>
<p>A: Keep the sickroom warm, humid, dim, and quiet for rest. Apply an ice pack to the head and a warm, moist cloth to the chest. Sometimes apply mustard.</p>
<p>Q: How should one deal with various symptoms?</p>
<p>A: When there is a fever, use a sweating method. Drink hot beverages, and occasionally use euquinine. When coughing, use inhalation, gargling, or take expectorant and cough suppressant. For itchy skin during the rash, use sterile oil and cloth. Wash the eyes with boric acid water and apply boric acid ointment to the nose or drop in Mistol.</p>
<p>Q: How should one take care of oneself after recovering from measles?</p>
<p>A: Wait one week after the fever has completely subsided before getting out of bed. You can go out after another week. During the recovery period, do not catch a cold to prevent pneumonia and other symptoms.</p>
<p>Q: What methods can be used to prevent measles?</p>
<p>A: Do not get close to people who are already sick (isolation). Injecting serum from patients in the recovery period is a very effective prevention method.</p>

<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>Although, we want to enable the ordinary public to understand medicine. But of course that is impossible. Not to mention the ordinary public, even the intellectual community, even the people in our own medical field, is impossible. The knowledge we research is only a very small part of what is currently recognized by the scientific community. There are still many, many unknown things in medicine. It can be said that unknown medicine is like a vast ocean. That vast amount of unknown medicine is still waiting for our medical community to study and work hard in the future to discover and explore. The medical knowledge we want to promote is extremely easy and simple, ubiquitous, universally practical, and available at all times. The reason why we have the inescapable responsibility to take on this task of popularization is precisely because the general public lacks this simple and vital everyday knowledge, is too far away from it, pays too little attention to it, and is too ignorant of its value! Therefore, in all aspects of Chinese society, there is a feeling of urgent need for the dissemination of medical knowledge. Shouldn't we doctors respond to the needs of the real world and take on this serious task of benefiting the masses and helping the world?</p>
<p>The above has broadly covered the tasks of doctors to treat the sick and suffering masses, and to publicize medical knowledge; now let us talk about another working task that has the same importance as the above one, that working task is the revolutionary task of anti-unscientific medicine. The so-called unscientific medicine is what people generally call "old medicine", that is. I think the name "old medicine" is very appropriate and fair. However, people in the general old medical community will certainly deny it; even the general public outside the world may inevitably say that it is a kind of sarcastic title of our new medical community for the old doctors. In fact, this is wrong: the so-called old medicine is because it is a kind of metaphysical medical skill of the past era; all its theories are based on the ancient metaphysical medical arguments and doctrines, and they are all restorationists who respect the ancients, copy the ancients, and drive backwards. Why do our scientific new doctors do this opposition work? This is very clear, because modern medicine is an applied science that is part of natural science, it is something that relieves human suffering and protects human health. This has been mentioned above. Since it is an applied science that is applied to the human body, needless to say, we must have a careful observation and accurate research on the organizational structure, physiological state, etc. of the human body in advance. Modern scientific new medicine is based on a kind of knowledge of the human body obtained through a long period of strict observation, accurate field experiments, and field research. The pathology, pharmacology, etc. that start from this kind of scientific foundation are reliable, and they are the true medicine that is not wrong in human health. Old doctors in the early past era also used to put in a lot of effort and hard work to observe and study. At that time, they also had their moment of glory; everyone also regarded him as the central theory at that time. However, the ancient people's observations and ancient people's research were of course not like the methods of applied science now. Therefore, although he observed, he did not observe meticulously; although he researched, he did not research accurately. Therefore, all his theories, all his facts, look irrational, false, and speculative from the perspective of modern science, and they are all groups saying lies.</p>

<p>Collecting the works of famous artists in abundance</p>
<p>(TASS News Agency, Kakov) At the end of 1932, a Ukrainian Historical Literature Museum was established here. The founders are well-known domestic scientists, writers, and political leaders. The first impression of visitors is the unprecedented development of literature in the past fifteen years. In the old Russian era, only 2,560 kinds of books were published in Ukraine in 120 years, while 6,000 kinds of books were published between 1929 and 1930. The museum also shows evidence that the creation of aesthetic value must be based on social conditions. From this, it can be seen that the economy and politics of a country are closely related. The museum has a large hall with the works of about 100 famous modern writers on display. Each writer has a special shelf, and the writer's political "face" and artistic "face" are revealed here. Another hall is dedicated to displaying the works of foreign writers living in Ukraine. There are 35 writers in total, with texts in Bulgarian, Molu Taiwan, Greek, Armenian Tartar, Polish, German, and Jewish. In addition, translated works also occupy a separate room. Ancient literature from Sophocles to Euripides, Dante, and even Goethe has been translated and completed in recent years.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Ministry Order for Rectifying the Two Law Schools <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>News of the Ministry of Education's rectification of the private Shanghai Law and Political Science College and Shanghai Law College was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The instruction to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau is recorded below. According to the report of the inspector of this Ministry, the situation of the private Shanghai Law and Political Science College and the private Shanghai Law College is excerpted as follows: Student level: After checking the admission qualifications, many are not in compliance with the regulations. Admission and transfer certificates from the Ministry are also mostly forged. Furthermore, checking the semesters and entrance examination papers reveals that the examination is extremely easy, and the grading is too lenient. The level of Chinese and foreign languages is particularly low. Teacher salaries: The highest monthly salary for full-time teachers is only one hundred and sixty or seventy yuan, and the lowest is thirty or forty yuan. Part-time teachers receive two, three, or four yuan per hour, varying. Curriculum: There are many types of courses, and the order of arrangement is not well considered. Basic courses are mostly lacking. Course materials focus on lectures, with little practical exercise or research. Equipment: The books in the Law and Political Science College library are old and mostly unusable. The Law College library was destroyed in the Shanghai Incident and cannot be verified. What exists now is only newspapers and magazines. Sports fields are lacking in both. Funding: The regular expenses are far from the minimum standard set by the Ministry, and they rely entirely on miscellaneous fee income. Although the Law and Political Science College claims that its funds are deposited in the bank, the college's budget does not list interest income. The Law College's funds have already been used for the construction of school buildings and auditoriums. School buildings: The Law and Political Science College has not fully resolved its debt disputes regarding school buildings. The Law College's school buildings were completely destroyed in the Shanghai Incident and are currently temporarily rented. During classes at the Law and Political Science College, many students at all levels are absent, the order is chaotic, and the spirit is poor. The interior of the school is filthy. The president does not often come to the school, and some teachers and staff receive salaries but do not come to the school to teach or work. In general, the management of these two colleges is very poor and violates many laws and regulations. According to Article 6 of the Regulations for Private Schools and the clear orders from the Central Government to eliminate departments such as literature and law, this Ministry should strictly ban them. However, the colleges are given a final opportunity for improvement and are temporarily handled leniently. They must immediately and rigorously improve. This Ministry will send personnel to inspect again to observe the subsequent effects. This order is to be issued to the Bureau to inform them to comply with it. This order.</p>

<p>Ministry of Railways Instructs the University to Handle According to Law</p>
<p>Due to the previous purchase of civilian land being insufficient for expansion, National Chiao Tung University intends to continue to collect land to the north and southwest of the school. It specially drafted a plan for purchasing civilian land, including maps and lists, and submitted them to the Ministry of Railways to inform the Ministry of Interior for approval and announcement. Now it has been learned that the Ministry of Interior has replied. The university has also recently received instructions from the Ministry of Railways, stating that the reply has been approved, and it complies with the provisions of the first half of Clause 7 of Article 2 of the Land Expropriation Law. In addition to approving the announcement according to law, two copies of the announcement and a copy of the previously submitted plan are enclosed for review and shall be posted at the expropriation site to inform the public. Still hope to handle according to law, etc., and enclosed the announcement and other documents to the Ministry. According to Article 12 of the Land Expropriation Law, "After the approval by the approving authority in Clause 8, if it is a national or provincial undertaking, the competent authority of the undertaking shall notify the local administrative authority to announce the detailed list of land to be expropriated, and notify the land owners and related parties," etc. In addition to consulting the Shanghai Special Municipal Government for verification and handling, this document is enclosed with Zhang, ordering the school to immediately post them at the expropriation site to inform the public, and also prepare a plan for purchasing civilian land, maps, and a list of the number of acres of civilian land purchased and the names of the owners, and directly contact the Municipal Government to handle it according to law, etc.</p>

<p>Recently, news reported that the Ministry of Communications had a proposal to increase postage to Nanyang, causing widespread panic. The Shanghai Jinan Alumni Association has always been extremely concerned about overseas Chinese affairs. In order to reduce the burden on overseas Chinese compatriots, it specially cabled the Ministry of Communications to postpone the increase in postage to Nanyang. The text of the cable is recorded below: To Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications: Recently, I heard that the Postal Administration is discussing increasing postage to Nanyang. In recent years, overseas Chinese compatriots in Nanyang have suffered from the impact of the world's economic recession, and all industries are declining, making life difficult. Now, the motherland government not only does not provide assistance, but also intends to increase postage to Nanyang, which is contrary to the original intention of caring for overseas Chinese compatriots. Moreover, overseas Chinese compatriots in Nanyang can still enthusiastically donate funds to save the country despite all kinds of difficulties, but our government does not remember this and should not take this kind of measure, which really disappoints overseas Chinese compatriots. Our association is aware of the suffering of overseas Chinese compatriots and dare not remain silent. I specially cable your ministry to quickly order the General Administration of Posts to postpone the increase in postage to Nanyang in order to relieve the difficulties of overseas Chinese. The cable is urgent and awaits your decision. Respectfully, Shanghai Alumni Association of National Jinan University.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Performance Reduced, Donghua Ties French Business Association 3-3 <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>—After a 3-1 Victory, French Business Association Scores Two Goals in a Row—</p>
<p>The Donghua soccer team, which has won repeatedly, has had smooth sailing in the Western League A group, creating a record of 16 consecutive victories and winning the championship. Yesterday's match against the French Business Association was originally unrelated to the championship, but Donghua should have worked hard to win in order to maintain the undefeated reputation of a perennial winning team. Unexpectedly, against all expectations, the game ended in a 3-3 draw amidst dangerous situations. In the first half, Donghua took a 2-1 lead. The French Business Association has indeed improved, and Donghua's performance has declined compared to before. Since then, it has been unable to obtain a completely new record.</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Enemy's Fierce Momentum Leads to Loss of Territory <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The French Business Association first had the right to kick off. Donghua intercepted it. Chen Yutian once charged straight along the side, but it was ineffective. The French Business Association immediately began the order to launch a general attack. The army advanced and attacked Donghua fiercely. The situation was extremely dangerous. Although Li Yichen once came out of the encirclement, he failed to score. Wan Xianghua had little opportunity to cooperate with his teammates under the surveillance of the enemy. Lu Zhongen changed positions and served as a midfielder. He touched the ball in his own territory. The French Valley kicked it to the center, and it reached the right wing, French Fafanqie. Coleto hooked back and centered the ball, but it was ruled offside and invalidated. Donghua's danger was evident. It had been half an hour. Feng Yunyou kicked a free kick, and the rebound was obtained by Lungeer, who went straight to Fafanqie. The French shot it into the middle, and Lungeer jumped up and charged, and the ball followed into the goal. Donghua's iron gate was lost.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Improvising and Scoring Two Goals in a Row <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Donghua repeatedly tried to fight back in this slump, but because of the strong enemy, they had to wait quietly for an opportunity. The Donghua players were all smart and quick-witted and could improvise and adapt. Therefore, in the last fifteen minutes of the first half, they broke the enemy's goal twice in a row, and the first half ended with a 2-1 lead. The teammates advanced, and French midfielder Grenell was monitoring Xiao Wan. Seeing the ball flying, he hurriedly kicked back, inadvertently falling behind his own line, resulting in a corner kick. Xiao Wan sent the ball to the center very accurately. Li Yichen saw that the front of the goal was heavily stacked with soldiers, pushed it back, and Feng Zhongjian rushed up and attacked with a strong kick, making it 1-1 and becoming a tie. In an instant of five minutes, Feng Lianyou shot hard, and the ball rebounded. Cao Qiuting deflected it to the left and reached the teammate, who returned to the right. Yu Tian led it and charged straight, not obliquely, beautifully hitting the enemy's goal. Donghua thus took a 2-1 lead in the first half.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Advantageous Situation Suddenly Becomes a Draw <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Donghua broke through the difficulties in the first half and gained an advantage. The atmosphere was new. In the first quarter of the second half, they added another goal, taking a 3-1 lead. Chen Jiaqiu and Li Yichen advanced in mutual assistance, passing the midfield. Li sent the ball to the right corner. Cao Qiuting returned it to the center. Feng Yunyou rushed up with a kick, and Chen Yutian flapped his hands and flew straight, breaking through three passes in a row, scoring with one attack, making it 3-1. Everyone thought that victory was guaranteed, but it was not so. Five minutes later, the French Fafanqie repeatedly failed to attack on the right. Once he rushed in, Guan Xun'an lost his mind and fell into the rear due to a rebound. Fafanqie got a good opportunity for a corner kick. Coleto, a famous inter-port player, headed it in, and Zhou Xianyan could not save it. The French were overjoyed and recovered half of the deficit. In the last twenty minutes, Donghua's danger did not disappear. Under severe pressure, they indeed lost territory again and became a 3-3 draw. Fafanqie attacked alone, and Li Ning could not stop him. The French had no obstacles after leaving Li and penetrated into the undefended territory and attacked, resulting in a draw and reducing hope. Donghua repeatedly attacked again, but could not change the result.</p>
<h3 id="e190">French Business Association Improves, Donghua Declines <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The French Business Association had the upper hand everywhere and had a great chance of winning. The two inside forwards, Coleto and Bochet, were the best, worthy of being inter-port players. It is a pity that Fafanqie is old and missed many opportunities. If the ball on the right corner was accurate, Donghua would have been defeated long ago. Li Yichen was the most diminished for Donghua, the connection between the forwards was greatly reduced, and Lu Jin'en was barely satisfactory. The two fullbacks were to blame. It was already fortunate that Donghua was not defeated. The formations of both sides are as follows:</p>

<p>To Compete Against Other Teams at the End of March</p>
<p>And Will Visit Suzhou, Xiamen, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jiangnan Track and Field Team, having returned from Peiping and Tianjin the year before last, originally intended to compete for glory for Shanghai in the National Games. Unexpectedly, the September 18th Incident suddenly occurred, and the Eastern Provinces fell, leading to the suspension of the National Games. As a result, the team remained silent for a long time. Last year, they once prepared to travel to Sichuan, going upstream along the Yangtze River, to promote sports in the various ports of Central and Western China. However, the Sichuan War broke out, and nothing came of it. Now, the Battle of Rehe is raging, and the government has announced that the National Games will be held on October 10th. Adhering to the purpose of strengthening the body to save the nation, the team, amidst the national grief over the loss of Chengde, convened a general meeting of all members yesterday at the Yuebinlou Restaurant. More than twenty people attended, including Hao Chunde, Fu Jincheng, He Debao, Zeng Rongzhong, Dong Shuzhao, Xia Xianxuan, Wang Jihuai, Gong Wanyu, Cao Yu, Chen Jiayou, Tao Yingjie, Yang Qingxie, Zhang Zaojiu, and Xie Xingdao. The meeting was presided over by Wang Fudan, the team manager. During the meeting, all agreed that to save the nation, one must first strengthen the body. Therefore, it was unanimously decided that all team members should start practicing diligently from today onwards, to be pioneers for the nation. It was also decided to have the first competition against another team (the MacLeans Team) at the end of February. If there is a turning point in the war, the team also plans to travel to Suzhou and Hangzhou during the spring vacation, and to Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, and other ports during the summer vacation, to fulfill its responsibility of promoting track and field sports.</p>

<p>— Gan</p>
<p>"On Human Rights" begins with a parrot. It is said that in ancient times, there was a parrot that flew far away and happened to pass by its own mountain forest. Seeing a large fire there, it dipped its wings in some water and sprinkled it on the mountain. People said that how could its little bit of water extinguish such a large fire? It said, "I have lived here before, and now I have to do my best." (This comes from "Le Yuan Shu Ying," as quoted in Hu Shi's preface to "A Collection of Essays on Human Rights"). A parrot can put out a fire, and human rights can be used to prettify a reactionary regime. This will not go unrewarded. Dr. Hu went to Changsha to give a lecture once, and General He gave him a travel allowance of five thousand yuan. The price is not small; this is "called" experimentalism.</p>
<p>However, how to put out the fire was not very clear during the "On Human Rights" period (1929-1930). After the retail price of five thousand yuan per time came out, it became different. Recently (February 21st of this year), the North-China Daily News published Dr. Hu's remarks, saying:</p>
<p>Any government should have the right to protect itself and suppress movements that endanger it. Of course, political prisoners, like other criminals, should receive legal protection and a fair trial...</p>
<p>This is much clearer! Isn't this talking about "government power"? Naturally, the doctor's mind is not simple; he would not just say, "One hand holds a sword, and the other holds the classics," like some ideologies. He says that one should also hold the law.</p>
<p>Chinese literati who help despots always have this set of ancestral secrets, talking about the kingly way and benevolent governance. Look how humorous Mencius is; he teaches you to stay far away from the place where pigs are slaughtered, while still maintaining a sense of compassion in your mouth, and also having the name of benevolence and righteousness. Not only does he deceive others, but he also deceives himself; this is truly called keeping the mind with principle and reaping endless benefits.</p>
<p>A poem says:</p>
<p>Cultural bureaucrat with a doctorate, human rights abandoned to speak of sovereignty, the court has always been full of massacres, this principle now relies on experimental transmission. Human rights and the kingly way are both renewed, to thank the emperor's grace, I奏for the sage's understanding, cruel politics may as well invoke laws, killing people like grass goes unheard. The gentleman is well-versed in the books of sages, the gentleman's way is never lonely, Mencius has the same heart throughout the ages, also teaching meat-eaters to stay away from the kitchen. A parrot that speaks is more poisonous than a snake, its tiny efforts are boastful, eager to sell its shame to the powerful, five thousand at a throw is not extravagant.</p>

<p>— Tang Gai</p>
<p>There is no dawn, and there is no dusk; the world is always without light for him. He does not know what is the expression of human happiness, nor what is the manifestation of human sorrow; his eyes are always a mass of darkness. Every day, he plays the sanxian, walking out of this alley and into another.</p>
<p>The world will never have compassion for him, and he does not even know that there are two words in this world called compassion. Every day, he hears the sound of pedestrians outside the door, and he takes his sanxian, gropes out the door, and goes to the streets and alleys to struggle for life. When the sound of pedestrians on the street gradually dissipates, he puts away his sanxian, walks out of the streets and alleys, and gropes back into his own doorway.</p>
<p>Every day, he plays the sanxian, walking out of this alley and into another.</p>
<p>The strings of the qin vibrate under his fingers, lightly exhaling sighs. He doesn't know why he has to embark on this vast journey. Whether it is morning or dusk, sunny or snowy, he plays the sanxian and just walks, just walking on this vast journey. He is very tired and wants to end this dark journey early, but the whip of life whips heavily, not allowing him to rest. He can only silently hold the sanxian and move forward.</p>
<p>When will he be able to walk out of this dark journey? Only heaven knows.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Visiting People <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Xiang</p>
<p>In "The Unofficial History of the Bureaucracy," it is said that those who are waiting for assignments to visit their superiors must prepare a sum of money as a "door package," otherwise, they will not even have the hope of meeting. I don't know if this situation still exists in the bureaucracy today, because I have never been an official. Most visitors, if they are thrifty, only need to deposit five li of money at the reception desk, which is the cost of a business card. They only ask for this five li of money, which is of no benefit to the reception desk, just like paper money and tin foil.</p>
<p>The best way to visit is to arrange a time in advance, otherwise, between the time the business card is sent in and the time the host arrives, there will be a period of waiting. Sometimes, even if the time has been arranged in advance, this period of waiting is still inevitable. Therefore, I suggest to visitors that, in addition to a business card, they should not forget to bring a book with them, preferably "Lord Chesterfield's Letters." It is important not to bring a book that the host would not like to see, such as "Essays," if the host is old-fashioned, "The Bible," if the host is modern, "Trotsky's Autobiography," if the host is a "Kuomintang member," or "The Three Principles of the People," if the host is a "nationalist." It would be even better if the host himself is an author... The host has arrived. If he waves his hand and offers you a cigarette, it is best to tell a white lie and say that you don't smoke, even if there is an elegant cigarette case or a "Big Cannon Platform" tobacco jar on the table. Acquaintances will take a cigarette on their own; strangers, if they are foolish, will take out a "British Brand" cigarette from the "Big Cannon Platform" tobacco jar. If the cigarette is handed to you in person, then you must act according to the circumstances. If the host knows that you smoke, you have to smoke it out of courtesy, even if it is a "British Brand." If, fortunately, he doesn't know, you can also tell a white lie and say that you don't... but you can't forget to say "thank you" again.</p>
<p>When visiting, you must bring a watch, but you must never look at it in front of the host. If you sit for too short a time, you are afraid that the host will think it strange; if you sit for too long, a disguised order to leave will make you embarrassed. Ah, the pain of visiting, the problem of staying or leaving!</p>
<p>Serving tea and seeing guests off is an ancient etiquette. In the modern era of new trends, the ancient etiquette has been abolished. How to issue a disguised order to leave depends on the host's intelligence. Not speaking; looking at the watch; discussing the weather; asking the visitor's address; and so on. Rickshaw drivers can come in to collect their wages; as for the doorman, he is an inexhaustible source of ideas in this regard.</p>
<p>Then you come out... hurry up and light a cigarette. When smoking, you can comfort yourself: It's a good thing the host wasn't "not at home."</p>
<h3 id="e203">Accommodation and Food for Students Studying in Paris (Continued) <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Fusheng</p>
<p>Food</p>
<p>Small hotels in the Latin Quarter only rent rooms and do not include meals. Students living high up in the heavens must descend to earth several times a day for the sake of their stomachs, even when they are not going to class.</p>
<p>The most popular places for students are the prix fixe restaurants. A very ordinary prix fixe meal usually includes an appetizer (Hors.d.oeuvre), a dish of meat or fish, a dish of vegetables, a dessert or fruit, a small bottle of wine or beer, a napkin, and a few pieces of bread (bread can usually be eaten as much as you want). Although the number of items is fixed, the dishes can be chosen by the customer. For example, for meat, there is beef, pork, lamb, rabbit, etc.; just for beef, there is fried steak, braised beef, etc., you can choose one. Although the cooking of this prix fixe meal is not great, the nutrients are very sufficient, and no matter how big your appetite is, you can always eat your fill. When I first arrived in Paris, such a prix fixe meal could be eaten for a little more than three francs, but now it costs five francs (about one yuan in national currency).</p>
<p>If you are not used to French cuisine, or are tired of being stuffed with steak and potatoes, then there are Chinese restaurants waiting for you everywhere in the 5th arrondissement.</p>
<p>Speaking of Chinese restaurants, this is the only thing Chinese people can be proud of. No matter how rude and disdainful the Japanese are towards the Chinese, they cannot help but drool when they see "Chinese cuisine" and praise it endlessly. In Paris, as in Tokyo, Chinese people are not good at other businesses, but only selling this crystallization of five thousand years of civilization—Chinese cuisine—can they still stand firm.</p>
<p>In a corner of the Latin Quarter, there are now more than ten Chinese restaurants. Most of these restaurants are very profitable. Most of the restaurant owners are Chinese laborers who participated in the war. Cooking was not their profession, but because most Chinese people have a talent for cooking, the Chinese food made by these "amateurs" is actually able to attract many foreign diners in Paris. It goes without saying that Annamese and Japanese students have become regular customers of these Chinese restaurants; French people and people from other countries are also very happy to come and play with Chinese chopsticks. Among them, "Shanghai Lou" in particular attracts the most foreign students because it is located next to the University of Paris.</p>
<p>Eating a meal at these Chinese restaurants, if you order à la carte, a single dish, including rice, will cost around ten francs; although "prix fixe rice" is a bit cheaper, the dishes are unpalatable, and two small dishes are not enough for people with a slightly larger appetite. It is really not as cost-effective as a prix fixe meal in a restaurant opened by French or other foreigners for five or six francs.</p>
<p>Since 1929, due to the rise in gold prices, most Chinese students in Paris have been very poor, and very few can afford to eat in restaurants for every meal. Six or seven out of ten use an alcohol lamp to cook something in their rooms to satisfy their hunger. Especially those who live outside the city, because it is inconvenient to eat (restaurants outside the city are usually more expensive than those inside the city), nine out of ten cook for themselves. A few years ago, when Mr. Sun Fuyuan lived in Rose Village, he often went out with a glass bottle to buy methylated spirits; now, Mr. Hu Yuzhi, the editor of the Oriental Magazine, also lived a self-catering life when he lived in a small hotel in the 5th arrondissement. These are all so-called celebrities in China today. The lives of celebrities in Paris are already like this, and the lives of other non-celebrity students can be imagined. However, there are still one or two exceptions among the celebrities, such as a certain bureaucratized art traitor Liu, who, when in Paris, took his beloved wife and children in and out of restaurants such as "Shanghai Lou" and "Wan Hua Lou" every day. But this is ultimately an exception.</p>

<p>— By Shaw Bernard, translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>"Only to hand us over to man-eating slave drivers and people-trampling gentlemen," said the black girl. "Lions and elephants share the land with us. When they eat and trample on our bodies, they let go of our souls. When they are full, they don't want anything else. But nothing will satisfy your greed. You make us work desperately for generations, until each of you has more to eat and use than a hundred of us; but you still force us to work harder and longer, while we get less and less food and clothing. You don't understand what you mean by enough; nor do you understand what we mean by not enough. We don't have money to buy the goods you sell, so you always grumble; your solution is just to give us less money. This must be because you worship false gods. You are heathens, you are barbarians. You don't know how to live, and you don't let others live. When I find God, I will have the spiritual power to destroy you, to teach my people not to destroy themselves."</p>
<p>"Look!" cried the first lady. "She's upsetting these men. I told you! She wants to be distant from the sample. Her."</p>
<p>"That inciting nonsense, they are listening carefully. Look at their eyes. That's a little dangerous. If none of you men move a hand, then I'm going to shoot her."</p>
<p>So the lady panicked and really drew her gun. But before she could get the gun out of its holster, the black girl pounced on her and ended her life with just one blow from her beloved "Knobkerry"; she then ran madly into the forest. So the black men couldn't help but be very happy.</p>
<p>"Thank God, her temper has improved," said the first gentleman. "For a moment, things seemed a little bad."</p>
<p>"Now everything is fine. Duke Tou: Would you be kind enough to examine the little brain of poor Miss Fitz-Jones?"</p>
<p>"The mistake we made," said the naturalist, "was not sending her a little of our food."</p>
<p>The black girl hid for a long time, until she was sure that no one was coming after her. She knew she was facing a case of flogging, and that no defense by a black defendant against a white plaintiff was effective. She didn't guard against mounted police; because mounted police were very rare in that area. She didn't want to just avoid the tour group; because this direction and that direction were the same for her purposes, she turned back and walked the way she had come (because the tour group was walking the way she had originally wanted to go), and by evening she felt that she was back at the well where she had spoken to the sorcerer. There she saw a stall selling many statues made of wood, plaster, and ivory; next to the stall, a large wooden cross lay on the ground, and the sorcerer lay on it with his knees bent and his arms outstretched. The stall keeper was carving his statue on the wood very quickly and skillfully. They were watched by a handsome Arab gentleman wearing a turban, who had a scimitar in his belt and was sitting on the well railing, twirling his beard.</p>
<p>"Why are you doing this, friend?" said the Arab gentleman. "You know this violates the second commandment that God gave to Moses. In theory, I could chop you to death with my scimitar; but I am enduring a lifetime of suffering because a spiritual weakness prevents me from calmly killing any animal, let alone a person. Why are you doing this?"</p>
<p>"What else can I do if I don't want to starve to death?" said the sorcerer. "I am the most abandoned person among people. The only way I can live is to sit here and be a model for this kind artist. I lie on this cross all day, and he gives me six pence every two hours. He sells these ridiculous images of me himself and makes a living from it. People play with me as a 'sinner at death' because they don't pay attention to anything except police news. When he has enough stock of statues, and I have saved up a certain amount of sixpence, I take a day off and go around giving good advice to people and telling them useful truths. If they would only listen to me, they would be as happy and good as possible. But they refuse to believe me unless I perform magic for them. When I perform magic, they only throw me copper coins, or sometimes 'tin openers'. They say I am a strange person, they say there has never been anyone like me in the world; but they continue to be foolish, disgusting, and brutal people. This makes me feel that God has sometimes abandoned me."</p>

<h3 id="e205">Wu Proverbs Rendered in Classical Chinese <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>Pure Wu proverbs exist in the mouths of illiterate common people. The higher the intellectual class, the more classical Chinese elements are contained in the Wu proverbs they use.</p>
<p>However, in the mouths of illiterate common people, there are occasionally Wu proverbs that have been rendered in classical Chinese. I will write them down below:</p>
<p>The use of the character "zhi" in Wu proverbs is a sign of classical Chinese rendering. For example, "yi peng zhi huo" (a wisp of fire), "yi qiang zhi ge" (separated by a wall), "yi shi zhi shi" (a matter of a lifetime) in ordinary Wu proverbs are all phrases that illiterate people would say. Other examples include "qi you ci li" (how can this be?), "fu zai hu ci" (not caring about this), "fu cheng qi ju" (not forming a situation), "zheng zhong qi shi" (treating it solemnly)... all of these idioms are spoken by everyone. Upon closer examination, every sentence is a classical Chinese rendering.</p>
<p>In the past, when private schools were popular, the books that children chanted inside were familiar to everyone. Often, people who did not know a single character could recite the readings of children. For this reason, some Wu proverbs were influenced by children's primers. For example, when someone ran away, everyone would say "tao zhi yao yao" (peach tree is young); when something was close to being risky, everyone would say "xian xian ling de" (manifesting virtue); and what about being so happy that it's "bu yi le hu" (isn't it joyful?) Eating until it's "yan zai hu ye" (where is it?). These Wu proverbs can still be heard often today, which shows that the children's readings of the past were deeply imprinted in the minds of the general public. These are Wu proverbs that have been rendered in classical Chinese.</p>
<p>There is a contradictory sentence in Wu proverbs, which is that when someone hears the sound of loud crying, they will also say: "ku de bu yi le hu?" (crying so much, isn't it joyful?) Using the words "cry" and "joy" in the same sentence is simply unbearable to analyze closely.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Pawn Tickets <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Shiyanye</p>
<p>Shanghai's Prosperity Is Only Superficial</p>
<p>A pawn ticket is a receipt for pawned clothes. Shanghai is an area known as a place where gold is everywhere, so logically pawn tickets and Shanghai people are not related. However, I see so many shops with the large characters "pawn" or "pledge" hanging in Shanghai, whether in bustling areas or quiet places, which proves that this reasoning is inaccurate. Pawning clothes is, logically, an act of the poor, but the fact is not so. There are plenty of people who wear splendid clothes who also have a pawn ticket or several in their wallets.</p>
<p>I once had this fantasy: If I could obtain absolute authority, leading hundreds of people, to impose an emergency curfew on the bustling Nanjing Road, ordering everyone from the Bund to the racecourse, whether in cars or walking, to stand still and not move, then the many people I led would specifically choose people in suits and leather shoes, fine Chinese clothes, and fashionable women, and search them inside and out, layer by layer, checking the deepest part of their wallets. Then there would definitely be many, many people who did not have a single banknote, not a single yuan coin, and perhaps a small silver yuan or not, but only a few yellow, smelly copper coins. In particular, there would be many pawn tickets, found in the deepest part of the wallets of many people, or perhaps more than half of the people would have this thing on them. In this way, what I said above, that people who wear splendid clothes also have pawn tickets, would be proven. How happy would I be to get this proof? However, what would be the facial expression of those who were found to have pawn tickets in the crowd at that time?</p>
<p>This fantasy of mine is also inspired by my feelings, because many of my friends wear suits and leather shoes and fine Chinese clothes. They seem to be members of the bourgeoisie, or at least not poor people, and they always run to the first class when getting on the tram. In reality, they only have a few coins for the fare in their pockets, and the rest are pawn tickets. The four seasons constantly circulate, and their clothes circulate in and out of Changsheng Library (pawnshop), and a wallet is specially bought to be a vault for pawn tickets. One winter evening, I walked past the door of a pawnshop. Two fair-skinned young women in fur coats walked out of the door. They walked in front of me and didn't notice me behind them. I only heard one of them say: "A good silk scarf is only worth one and a half yuan when pawned. Things are really worthless now!" Such beautiful people still go to Changsheng Library, and what is being pawned is a scarf needed in winter, so it goes without saying that all of her clothes for the three seasons of spring, summer, and autumn are pawned. It seems that there are so many pawn tickets in her pocket that she could hold an exhibition. Pawn tickets are not just the property of the poor. I have found confirmation in my friends and that woman. Friends! Have you also seen this kind of person? Shanghai's prosperity is only superficial. I am increasingly convinced of this by the many people who appear wealthy but carry pawn tickets on their persons.</p>

<p>| On Saving the Nation Through Aviation |</p>
<p>The cry for "saving the nation through air defense" has been echoing these past few days, as high as the Japanese planes fly. Beneath the Japanese planes, like startled birds, the Chinese people are constantly craning their necks, waiting to see the national heroes who will compete to go beyond the borders to "save the nation through aviation" by bombing the Japanese planes, devastating Ye County, and incinerating Chengdu. "Non-resistance" has become a thing of the past. "Prolonged resistance" is a dead end. "Empty talk of saving the nation is useless." "Armed resistance" requires airplanes. Advocating aviation is indeed a crucial plan for saving the nation. "Having a patriotic heart but lacking the means to save the country," even those compatriots who only love the nation with their mouths dare not fail to be moved to tears at this critical juncture, unprecedented in thousands of years, and dig into their pockets to contribute silver dollars to support the century-long grand plan of "saving the nation through aviation." This brilliant plan of "saving the nation through aviation" can indeed make the enemy shrink three inches. However, within a year or half a year, a large number of aircraft will have been purchased, but it is not an easy or ordinary matter to train a large number of skilled pilots in a short time. By the time everything is ready and they are dispatched to Rehe to recover the lost territory in one fell swoop, while on the one hand "saving the nation through aviation" and on the other hand not abandoning "prolonged resistance" and slowly seeking divine help at the last moment, the Chinese people who are stretching their necks in the cellars under the enemy planes will have long been displayed in piles in the dried fish markets of the Japanese archipelago. In my humble opinion, it is better to "save the nation with anti-aircraft guns" than to "save the nation through aviation," as it is more reliable, convenient, and easy to implement. Once anti-aircraft guns are transported in, they can be used, at least avoiding the trouble of recruiting or training pilots when using the "saving the nation through aviation" method. Equip each army with several anti-aircraft guns. When one enemy plane comes, shoot it down and flip it over. When ten planes come, shoot down ten of them and make them crash to the ground. Collect the hopelessly damaged enemy planes and display them, just like the Japanese transported the plaque of "The First Pass Under Heaven" to Tokyo as a souvenir. Repair the better ones and use them for "saving the nation through aviation." "Saving the nation with anti-aircraft guns" is clearly like Zhuge Liang borrowing arrows, isn't that a better deal?</p>

<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Natural disasters and human calamities have engulfed the entire China in a state of absolute depression. Speaking of natural disasters, floods and droughts have displaced countless poor people and buried countless beloved compatriots. The various tragic scenes are too numerous to describe, truly causing immense sorrow and bringing tears to one's eyes!</p>
<p>However, most wealthy people continue to indulge in pleasure, remaining unmoved. Once they themselves encounter disaster, they have the money to flee elsewhere, as if donating from their pockets to help others is not their responsibility. To sit idly by and watch others perish is, without exaggeration, heartless.</p>
<p>Not only that, but some people even use the name of "disaster relief" to fill their private pockets, disregarding the lives of the people. The malice in their hearts is even greater than that of snakes and scorpions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to watch the preview screening of the Mingxing Film Company's production, "Turbulent Currents." I felt that the aforementioned heartbreaking phenomenon had been fully exposed. The plot describes the disregard for the people's livelihood by a wicked gentry, causing one's hair to stand on end in anger. The realism of the scenery is heartbreaking and shocking, as if one were personally experiencing the situation. All my compatriots should watch it.</p>

<p>Chapter One</p>
<p>Being Hospitable and Cordial, Especially Inviting a Poor Woman, Remembering the Entrance with Generosity, Particularly Possessing the Ambition of a Soldier</p>
<p>Jiang said: "We mother and daughter shrink in the house all day long, feeling stifled. When Second Master comes, we can chat." Second Master Gan said: "You'll soon have neighbors moving in here, and it'll be lively in the future." Jiang frowned and said: "Lively in the future? I'm worried about that. They are military officers, and we are just ordinary residents. Living with them, I'm afraid we won't get along." Second Master Gan laughed and said: "Speaking of it that way, you seem to have some proud bones. But speaking of it, I'm also a small official, so you probably don't welcome me either." The old girl stood on the side, just smiling and saying nothing. Jiang quickly interjected and said: "What are you saying? If we can't get along with someone like Second Master, what kind of person can we get along with?" As she spoke, the old girl had already taken the package from Second Master Gan's hand. Without even opening it to look, she put it in a broken box by the head of the kang (heated brick bed). Second Master Gan laughed and said: "Old girl, aren't you going to measure the cloth? If it's not enough, and I want you to make me a piece of clothing, you'll have to pay me for the material." The old girl laughed and said: "Second Master, you're not someone who is unwilling to part with an inch or two of material when making clothes. Even if it's short an inch or two, I'll tell Second Master, and Second Master will believe me and won't say that we kept the material." Hearing people say such intimate words, Second Master Gan couldn't help but laugh from the bottom of his heart. Just because the Yang family was an old-fashioned family, and Jiang was present, he couldn't just say jokes casually just because they were poor. So he was still extremely serious, just smiled slightly, and then walked out to the outer room. When he walked out to the outer room, the old girl also immediately said to her mother: "There are no vegetables for dinner yet, I'm going to go to the street to buy two pieces of tofu to eat." As she spoke, she followed Second Master Gan out behind him. When she reached the gate, she laughed and said: "Second Master, didn't you want to drink millet porridge?" Second Master Gan said: "That's right, how did you know?" The old girl said: "This morning, I saw your servant running back from the street with a big pottery jar. He told me you wanted to drink this. We're cooking congee tonight. I'll have the servant bring a bowl to your house to scoop some, okay?" Second Master Gan laughed and said: "Amitabha! You mother and daughter are so frugal, and I'm going to take food from you." The old girl said: "A liter of millet makes a big pot of porridge. No matter how poor we are, we can always afford to send a pot of millet porridge to someone." Second Master Gan laughed upon hearing this and said: "Then I'll definitely bother you." He laughed and left. Upon hearing this, the old girl didn't buy tofu. Instead, she bought red beans and millet on the street, put them in a large pottery pot, and put them on the fire to cook. Jiang said: "Why are you cooking such a big pot of millet porridge? Are you planning to eat it for three days and three nights?" The old girl didn't say anything, but just pursed her lips and smiled (3).</p>

<p>Women, who have always been veiled by old etiquette, have always adhered to the "golden man's three silences"! Occasionally, there were many talented women who were "presenting memorials like Ban Zhao" and "composing willow catkin poems like Xie Daoyun," but in the eyes of men, they all seemed to be "inauspicious things"!</p>
<p>It was not until the early Republic era when women's liberation was advocated that people realized that women and men should have equal status and the same freedom of speech. In the third year of the Republic [1914], various publishing houses published many magazines about women. The Zhonghua Book Company published "Zhonghua Women's World," the Commercial Press published "Women's Magazine," and there were other things like "Women's Magazine" and "Women's Times." Ms. Lianshi edited "Chinese New Women's World Magazine" in Japan. For a time, it was also quite a sight to behold. Later, the Kaiming Bookstore published "New Women," and the Liangyou Book Company published "Contemporary Women." Places like Beijing, Tianjin, Hankou, and Hangzhou also published women's daily newspapers, women's weekly newspapers, women's guide newspapers, and women's ten-day publications. It's a pity that most of them were "red beauties with short lives," and none of them managed to achieve permanent existence.</p>
<p>It seems that after the January 28th Incident, even the Commercial Press stopped republishing "Women's Magazine," which is especially heartbreaking!</p>
<p>It seems that in the past, small newspapers and magazines edited by general sons all published photos of prostitutes and actresses, but now they are following the trend of the times and using female students as a facade. It is absolutely impossible to compare the noble personality of female students with that of prostitutes. It seems that we female students should protest, strongly reject, and not allow others to publish them. This cannot be regarded as a way to show off!</p>
<p>Especially in practical matters, many of these newspapers and magazines fundamentally lack women's freedom of speech. Since they are called women's publications, even if not all of them must be written by women, they should discuss issues that are closely related to women and serve as a precursor to improving family and society.</p>
<p>Women should no longer be "human puppets" or "social wooden figures"!</p>

<p>"Going to the beauty salon to wash and perm hair." We often hear sisters say this. It seems that they can't wash or perm their hair well at home. It seems that after being adorned at the beauty salon, they can become as beautiful as celestial beings! There are some small studies among them.</p>
<p>Some people soak their hair in water before applying shampoo. Mild water is also added with some borax. However, borax is suitable for soft and shiny hair, but not suitable for astringent and slender hair.</p>
<p>Washing hair must go through the procedure of applying soap lather twice, and each time must be rinsed clean in water. "Rinsing" is just to wash away all kinds of dust, short hair, dandruff, grease, and the like.</p>
<p>After rinsing twice, you can mix half a lemon juice with one ounce of "Hydrogen Peroxide" and melt it in hot water and use it to pour on the hair. This method is suitable for hair of all colors, and the purpose is to prevent the hair from becoming dull, but it is more suitable for people with black hair to use "Sage Tea And Vinegar".</p>
<p>When perming hair, I think "water perm" is better than alcohol perm and electric perm, which can avoid damaging beautiful hair.</p>
<p>If you want to water perm, you have to use Hair Waving Lotion. If you add a little alkali to the hair waving lotion, the result will definitely be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Buying hair waving lotion on the market is too expensive. Here is a simple homemade method:</p>
<p>Potassium carbonate</p>
<p>Half a teaspoon</p>
<p>Rose Water four ounces</p>
<p>Put potassium carbonate in rose water and shake the bottle to make it completely combined.</p>
<p>There is also a kind of "loose hair comb" for water perms. The Water Waving Comb sold on the market is a British product, but imitation is simple and easy.</p>
<p>The result of the hair being loosened into a wave pattern can be preserved for one or two weeks.</p>

<h3 id="e213">U.S. Financial Panic <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Fengwu</p>
<p>America, known to the world as a "Gold Kingdom," has unfortunately experienced a financial panic in its financial sector, affecting the entire nation. We watch from afar, wondering how, despite its abundant gold reserves, this run on banks could occur. Is gold truly powerless to prevent disasters?</p>
<p>This crisis began at the United Guardian Trust Company in Detroit, Michigan, the world's leading automobile manufacturing center. The company lacked sufficient cash to meet depositor withdrawals and the interest payments on loans from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC). As rumors spread, people became anxious, and depositors rushed to withdraw their funds. Michigan Governor Comstock, on the night of February 13th, convened an emergency meeting with local banking leaders and, with the approval of the Department of Commerce and the Treasury, declared a statewide financial emergency. He ordered all banks, trust companies, and financial institutions to close for eight days, from the 14th to the 21st. As a result, all 420 state banks, 120 national banks, and the stock exchange in the state were shut down. This was the largest economic crisis since the decline of the American economy and has drawn the attention of the global financial community.</p>
<p>Since the crisis began, banks across the country have been rushing cash by train or plane to provide assistance, totaling between 40 and 50 million dollars. Following the advice of Nash and Chrysler, and General Motors, the Ford Company provided United Guardian Trust Company with $20 million in cash, greatly reducing public panic. Governor Comstock stated that the main cause of the crisis was largely due to the panic among small depositors. He said that the suspension order could be lifted once people were assured that their deposits were safe. On the 17th, the Michigan Senate passed a resolution declaring a state of emergency and authorizing the governor to extend the bank suspension period to regulate withdrawals. The suspension of cash payments was also extended to utility bills such as electricity, gas, and telephone, as well as municipal worker wages, which were paid half in cash and half in checks. When the initial suspension period expired on the 21st, the governor ordered all banks to reopen on the 22nd, but only allowed withdrawals of 5% of deposits. Meanwhile, the Ford family took over the First National Bank and United Guardian Trust Company for reorganization. However, because New York banks refused Ford's assistance, the First National Bank's reorganization plan continued to operate under the existing withdrawal restrictions. The trust company was taken over by the Manufacturers National Bank, organized by Ford, which acquired its assets. It is said that a total of 8.25 million gold dollars was invested.</p>
<p>When the crisis first erupted, the entire United States was shaken. Stock market prices in New York and other major cities plummeted immediately. Trading in U.S. dollars was extremely active on the London market, with a particularly large difference between spot and forward prices, reaching as much as 2.5 cents per pound. As a result, American banks profited by buying three-month forward contracts while simultaneously selling spot contracts. The Senate also questioned the actions of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), suspecting that it often loaned large sums to banks that were about to fail, and called for a thorough investigation of the company's operations.</p>
<p>Since the bank run in Michigan began, efforts have been made to maintain stability and gradually quell the crisis. However, the result of restricting withdrawals has made people wary. Soon, the crisis spread to Maryland in the eastern United States. A bank run also occurred there. In just one week, withdrawals in Baltimore alone reached around $13 million. Although this was not significant compared to the state's $500 million in deposits, the withdrawal of $6 million on Friday alone was alarming. By the morning of February 24th, there were signs of even greater runs, and two banks were on the verge of collapse. Governor Ritchie convened an emergency meeting of the state's six largest banks and decided to temporarily close all banks in the state for three days to protect the interests of depositors and banks. A total of 205 banks were closed. According to the governor, the foundations of the state's banks were very solid, and only a few were unable to cope with the sudden bank run.</p>
<p>Baltimore, Maryland, is only 40 miles from Washington, D.C., and the financial sectors of the two cities are closely linked. Upon receiving this news, Washington D.C. was greatly shaken, and it was generally seen as a sign of instability in the entire U.S. banking system. There was criticism that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) had the authority to alleviate this situation but failed to do so, allowing the closures to occur. It was asked whether this was because the banks in question failed to provide the corporation with the necessary collateral for loans. The Maryland legislature, which already had a bill restricting the amount of withdrawals that could be made without prior notice, quickly passed it in the hope of implementation. However, the situation had already deteriorated, and it was difficult to salvage. National anxiety could not be dispelled, and an unprecedented financial panic intensified and became unmanageable.</p>
<p>After hearing about the bank runs and closures in Michigan and Maryland, the American people's trust in banks was greatly shaken, and small depositors rushed to withdraw their savings. State legislatures also discussed granting governors the power to declare bank holidays to reduce losses for both sides. On the 26th, the legislatures of 20 states convened to discuss this matter. The governors of Indiana, Arkansas, and Wisconsin signed bills to declare bank holidays if necessary. At the same time, New York, New Jersey, and three other states increased the power of the governor to help banks maintain operations and promote improvements. Banks also took precautionary measures. For example, four banks in Kansas, with deposits of $5 million, merged with the Commerce Trust Company. Due to the unfavorable situation, 18 banks in Ohio, with a total of $81.5 million in deposits, declared a suspension of payments on the 27th. The Dayton City Council convened an emergency meeting and immediately declared a bank holiday. However, the state legislature passed a law allowing banks to restrict withdrawals in emergencies to prevent bank runs, but only with the approval of the State Banking Commission. As a result, banks in Dayton, Akron, Lima, Cleveland, and other cities reopened under withdrawal restrictions. The Pennsylvania legislature also allowed banks to independently determine withdrawal restrictions without the approval of the state.</p>
<p>Despite these measures, public confidence had already been undermined, and the crisis spread further, gradually entering the Midwest and affecting the West. Banks in southern Ohio, Delaware, and Tennessee voluntarily closed for five days on March 1st. California, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and other states successively declared holidays or imposed withdrawal restrictions. By March 2nd, 18 states had declared bank holidays, affecting over 50 million people. More states continued to announce bank holidays and withdrawal restrictions. After the close of business on March 3rd, even New York and Illinois, known as financial centers, could not avoid declaring bank holidays. In the District of Columbia, the U.S. Congress passed a bill on March 3rd granting the President and the Comptroller of the Currency unlimited power to manage deposits and withdrawals in the District of Columbia, in order to preserve the capital's financial hub. The panic spread nationwide. In just the three days, the losses caused by the financial crisis in the United States reached $11.6 million, and the number of banks that declared holidays or imposed withdrawal restrictions reached 3,000. The following is a table summarizing the withdrawal measures implemented by banks in various U.S. states, based on reports from various news agencies. However, due to the brevity and incompleteness of the reports, omissions and errors are inevitable. Your understanding is appreciated. However, all possible effort has been made. (As of the telegraphs on March 4th.)</p>

<p>Dakota: Same as above.</p>
<p>Illinois: Closed for three days beginning March 4th.</p>
<p>Washington: Same as above.</p>
<p>(Note) According to a Havas News Agency dispatch on the 4th, only four of the 48 states in the United States had not yet declared bank holidays: Montana, Colorado, Dakota (North and South Dakota, one of them has already declared a holiday), and South Carolina. However, Reuters reported that only South Carolina had not. In short, all banks in the United States have fallen into a state of suspension.</p>
<p>The U.S. government's initial response to this crisis was to draft measures to assist in clearing devalued assets when the Michigan run occurred. When Maryland subsequently experienced a run, both houses of Congress passed the Goldsborough Emergency Banking Act, which authorized national banks to assist troubled banks in times of financial emergency. It also granted the Comptroller of the Currency the authority to limit withdrawals of the $17,000,000,000 in deposits held by the more than 6,000 banks across the United States, which was approved by President Hoover and became law. The act granted the Comptroller of the Currency temporary emergency powers for a period of one month, which could be extended with the approval of the President and the Secretary of the Treasury. However, the states already had this power over state-chartered banks. On March 1st, Congress also passed the Frazier-Lemke Farm Bankruptcy Act by a vote of 207 to 26, which was sent to the President for signature. The act allowed debtors to apply to the court for a delay in debt repayment to avoid foreclosure. By this time, the crisis had spread across the country. On the 4th, it was also announced that banks that had already restricted cash withdrawals could receive financial assistance from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) if they were in urgent need of funds and had sufficient collateral. (The RFC's requirement that loans must be fully secured has been criticized by some in the financial community, as banks with sufficient collateral would not have difficulty securing loans.) It is hoped that the RFC can be flexible, otherwise many banks will never find an opportunity to borrow from the RFC. President Hoover had planned to convene a special session of the new Congress on March 20th to discuss emergency legislation to address the banking crisis in the United States. The House Banking Committee had prepared to meet and consider legislation. Senators advocated for the establishment of a postal savings system and granting the new President and Comptroller of the Currency the necessary authority to safeguard deposits. The Tennessee Clearing House had developed a method to allow banks to issue their own currency, in denominations ranging from one to twenty dollars, so that depositors could withdraw funds and banks could meet their obligations. There were even reports that Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt had discussed abolishing gold payments or prohibiting cash exports. After Roosevelt took office, he issued a statement to the nation, stating that in order to deal with the ongoing panic, he would ask Congress for full powers, as in wartime, and that he would convene a special session of Congress very soon.</p>
<p>000000000</p>
<p>The impact of this bank run domestically has been that American money, due to depositor panic, and securities have been transferred to Canada. Within the first two days of the month, tens of millions of dollars had moved, causing the Canadian dollar to rise by two cents, and the momentum has not stopped. People with money dare not deposit it in their own country, fearing that it will become dead money. According to the monthly report released by the Federal Reserve Board, the amount of U.S. currency in circulation increased by $134 million in one week, reaching the highest limit. The amount of deposits withdrawn in the past three weeks is unprecedented. Cash reserves have decreased by $116 million this week. Most private individuals are withdrawing deposits, especially in New York, where the total amount of deposits in various banks has decreased from 440 million dollars to 278 million dollars. Recently, all foreign exchange, securities, and cotton markets have also closed, and all industries have come to a standstill. The impact can be described as huge.</p>
<p>Abroad, there was a panic when the Michigan crisis first erupted, but it soon subsided. However, by March 4th, the overseas situation was completely different. The London Bankers' Clearing House Committee decided to suspend all foreign exchange transactions. According to news from major European ports, the number of ports suspending foreign exchange transactions increased. Only the British pound was traded in Dalian, and there was no U.S. dollar market in Paris, and banks did not honor U.S. bank checks. Rome suspended U.S. dollar trading for two hours. The Italian National Bank wired New York banks to convert all deposits into gold accounts, fearing that the United States might ban gold exports and repeat the United Kingdom's abandonment of the gold standard.</p>
<p>000000</p>
<p>The reason for the severity of this financial crisis in the United States is unknown even to American banking experts. Although it started in Detroit, the situation there had calmed down when it broke out in other cities. As the crisis intensified, between February 25th and 28th, it created the current situation of nationwide bank closures. There is no other reason than that the beginning of the crisis was subtle, and when the public heard that the banks experiencing runs were closing, they were afraid of being affected and rushed to withdraw their deposits from the banks to prevent unforeseen circumstances. The more intense the panic among depositors, the greater the risk to the banks, and the banks were unable to cope, leading to closures. Banks closed in one place and depositors became even more panicked. Everyone thinks only of immediate gains and not of the losses after banks collapse. No matter what governments and police warn, they cannot stop depositors from withdrawing money. At this time, the psychology of depositors has become abnormal. They are just afraid of being left behind and not being able to withdraw their deposits. This is not only true for banks. Even companies with solid foundations are sometimes forced into bankruptcy due to the lack of cash flow, as the banks and money shops tighten their grip. Banks accept deposits, but in addition to setting aside a certain amount of cash as reserves, the rest is circulated to industries and businesses. There is no reason to hoard large amounts of cash, so if depositors rush to withdraw money beyond the normal reserve, the banks will naturally be unable to cope and will not be able to immediately recover their loans. If one bank experiences withdrawals, other banks can provide assistance. However, now that most banks in the United States are experiencing withdrawals, the only option is to temporarily close. Rumors spread rapidly. This shows the panic of the people and that disaster often arises from small things.</p>
<p>The underlying cause is still the impact of the global economic recession. Since most countries abandoned the gold standard, the United States has maintained the status quo. As a result, foreign trade is clearly unfavorable. Internally, there is overproduction, falling prices, economic downturn, increased unemployment, and hardship for the people. For example, cotton prices have fallen to one-fourth of what they were three years ago, and wheat and pork prices have fallen to one-third. Farmers, workers, and businesses are all suffering from this serious impact. In order to increase domestic prices and restore export trade, Borah advocated (1) resolving the war debt issue (as long as it is not resolved, U.S. financial resources will be reduced); (2) currency inflation to raise prices; (3) reducing government spending (U.S. government spending has expanded, such that every minute spent requires over $2,300 and that every person works four months a year to support the government); (4) changing the value of currency, establishing a bimetallic standard of gold and silver, raising the price of silver, and reorganizing private debt to eliminate panic. However, this was disliked by Republicans. In his farewell address, President Hoover said that the United States had reached a crossroads in the economy. The first path is for countries to cooperate, remove barriers to world trade, and eliminate obstacles to raising prices. This is the path to immediately relieve agriculture and reduce unemployment worldwide. The second path is for the United States to rely on its vast territory and resources, increase tariffs. The third path is to inflate the currency, abandon the gold standard, and enter a global economic war, but the result will inevitably be mutual destruction. However, since the Democratic Party came to power, the financial industry has experienced an unprecedented panic, and Hoover's words may change.</p>
<p>American banks have been affected by the aforementioned factors, and the goods and assets they hold have depreciated due to economic inadequacy or falling prices. As a result, they have lost the trust of depositors, and the bank run is rooted in this. What the future holds remains to be seen. March 4th, Year 22.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Commentary on National Coinage Design <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>National coinage must possess appropriate design, including its pattern, diameter, weight, fineness, and other virtues. The diameter, weight, and fineness of our national coinage are all clearly stipulated by law. With the exception of the silver coins of the Qing Dynasty, patterns are typically defined by edict. This aspect of design holds considerable value for research, leading to the emergence of a discipline known as "Heraldfytty" [likely a misprint for "Heraldry"]. Through these designs, we can discern various manifestations of a nation's character, encompassing the political systems of the time, changes in religious beliefs, the flourishing or decline of aesthetic values, the waxing and waning of customs, and the rise and fall of cultural artifacts and craftsmanship. Though seemingly a minor detail, it is intrinsically linked to a nation's honor and standing.</p>
<p>The designs of our national coinage, from the dragon of the Qing Dynasty to the Yuan Shikai portrait of the early Republic, the commemorative coins of the founding of the Nationalist government, and the newly announced coinage of the Central Mint, have undergone several changes. Are these new designs progressive, regressive, rational, or irrational? Let us examine them separately.</p>
<p>(1) The Birth and Death of Minting Locations: National coinage, being a form of currency universally used throughout the country, should only bear the name of the nation, without specifying the location of minting. This is a common principle among all countries. During the Qing Dynasty, numerous mints were established, resulting in multiple coinages, with each coin bearing the name of the province in which it was minted. This was a flaw. The Yuan Shikai coinage of the early Republic eliminated this defect, and the new national coinage follows suit. This is a point of progress.</p>
<p>(2) The Birth and Death of Weight and Relative Value: The weight and relative value of national coinage are invariably specified by law in all countries. Mints adhere to these laws during production, and the public relies on them during transactions. Such regulations are considered essential and inviolable. Various Qing Dynasty coinages were deficient in this regard, resulting from lingering irrational customs. Since the establishment of the Republic, there has been considerable effort to eliminate these flaws, freeing up coin design from unnecessary complications. This represents a second point of progress.</p>
<p>(3) The Emergence and Vanishing of Foreign Languages: National coinage differs from trade currency. National coinage represents the nation itself, and as such, should not feature any language other than the national language. Trade currency, on the other hand, is specifically designed to facilitate trade and may include foreign languages. When Zhang Zhidong was initially granted permission to mint silver dollars during the Qing Dynasty, the intention was to counter the influence of Mexican silver dollars, which included both Chinese and foreign languages to facilitate trade with foreign countries. This was essentially a form of trade currency. However, in practice, weighing was still used in both Chinese and foreign transactions. In international trade, silver dollars were simply considered raw silver, and the inclusion of foreign languages had no practical value. Later, various provinces began minting silver dollars, and the national coinage status of silver dollars was formally established by the regulations governing silver coinage. However, the inclusion of foreign languages in the design persisted. The Yuan Shikai coinage alone eliminated this defect, which must be considered a significant improvement. The commemorative coins of the founding of the Nationalist government reverted to the use of foreign languages, purportedly because these coins were different from ordinary coins and were intended to be displayed both domestically and internationally. However, the inclusion of foreign languages on national coinage is somewhat flawed. Recognizing this, the new national coinage completely omits foreign languages, which constitutes a third point of progress.</p>
<p>(4) The Merits and Demerits of the Obverse Pattern: In addition to the aforementioned points regarding the birth and death of design elements, the patterns themselves are also worth discussing. The obverse of the new national coinage features a profile portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, with the dignified inscription "Republic of China, Year Twenty-One" above it, which is perfectly suited to the national identity. Whether judged by national policy, historical context, or the preferences of the national character, this portrait is well-suited to representing the nation. It represents a significant improvement compared to the superstitious dragon of the Qing Dynasty, or the Yuan Shikai portrait which betrayed an imperial autocracy. This is the fourth point of progress.</p>
<p>Historically, the portraits on coinage have generally been idealized, such as the use of the Statue of Liberty in the United States. Alexander the Great initiated the practice of using his own portrait on coinage, setting a precedent for using contemporary figures on coin designs. However, this practice is not ideal. Yuan Shikai, as the head of a republic, embraced the imperial autocracy's concept of "I am the state," attempting to use himself, a single individual, to represent the nation. This was a delusion. Sun Yat-sen, however, was the pioneer of the founding of the nation and the precursor of the Three Principles of the People. Everyone who knows China knows about Dr. Sun, and every Chinese citizen reveres Dr. Sun. The use of his portrait on coinage as the design of national coinage is vastly different in its impact on the national character. The effects on the national character, and the impact on the national psychology, are incommensurable.</p>
<p>(5) The Merits and Demerits of the Reverse Pattern: The reverse of the new national coinage features the rising sun, a sailboat setting forth, and seagulls soaring above the sea, with the characters "One Yuan" inscribed on either side. The design is dynamic and full of vitality, well-suited to promoting the spirit of development and progress. In this time of national crisis, fraught with internal and external threats, such a design is particularly appropriate. The reverse of the commemorative coins of the founding of the nation features stalks of grain, as does the Yuan Shikai coinage. Since our nation is founded on agriculture, and grain represents prosperity, such designs are unobjectionable. However, in terms of dynamism and progress, the new coinage is superior. If the people of the nation can be inspired to become self-reliant and shed the lethargy and stagnation of the past, this national coinage can truly represent the modern national character. This constitutes a fifth point of progress.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the designs of the new national coinage lack superfluous or useless patterns and characters. They are well-suited to representing the national identity and promoting the national character. The characters are limited to the name of the nation, the year, and the denomination. The patterns, in addition to the aforementioned rational points, are free of any disjointed or fragmented elements. The commemorative coins of the founding of the nation can be considered progressive in design, but they feature foreign languages on the reverse and superfluous floral ornaments on either side of the obverse. The new national coinage surpasses them in its improvements. The ingenuity of the designers deserves our gratitude.</p>
<p>While the design of the coinage is important, strict quality control during minting is essential to prevent wear and counterfeiting. Regular and public chemical assays of the weight and fineness are necessary to maintain the credibility of the national coinage. It is hoped that the minting authorities will pay close attention to this.</p>

<p>Sunday, the Call Loan Market is Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai silver market saw scarce transactions and no competition, resulting in morning and afternoon prices resembling the previous day, at 7 qian, 1 fen, 4 li, 8 hao, 7 hu, and a half. Call loan transaction requests were extremely rare. Morning transactions were only 200,000, and afternoon transactions were even lower at 10,000, indicating a quiet situation. The call loan market was mostly comprised of transfers, so competition was limited. Both morning and afternoon results were the same as the previous day at 2 fen. Total transactions of call loans, transfers, and new transactions were less than 4 million. Banks were closed for the Sunday holiday and did not accept deposits. Money shops and foreign firms accepted over 3.8 million, but clearinghouse transfers were not accepted. Remittances from various routes amounted to 400,000. Silver firms accepted over 16 million, and small money shops traded 300,000. Subsidiary coins, both morning and afternoon, for Jiangnan small silver dollars were at 6 qian, 1 fen, 7 li, a slight decrease of 1 li from the previous day. Morning transactions were 3,500 jiao, and afternoon transactions were 2,000 jiao. Guangdong small silver dollars were 5 qian, 8 fen, 5 li, 7 hao, and a half in the morning, and 5 qian, 8 fen, 5 li in the afternoon. Morning transactions were 30,000 jiao, and afternoon transactions were 15,000 jiao. Copper coins with length added 500 wen, totaling 422,500 wen. Transactions amounted to over 38,000 strings of cash.</p>

<p>Due to the tense situation and potential sudden changes in the British exchange rate, the Gold Exchange might not open on schedule today or may be delayed until 9:30 AM, depending on whether HSBC posts official exchange rates.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Securities Market Detached from the Situation Last Week <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Too Many Shorts Feeling Insecure</p>
<p>Several Issues Unmoved, Large Increases Over Two Days</p>
<p>From February 27th to March 4th of last week, the public bond market of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw no trading on February 27th due to the settlement of February futures contracts, resulting in only five days of trading. Initial trading was slightly volatile, followed by large increases over two days, ultimately ending in a pullback. Amidst unfavorable news from the Rehe front and increasingly tense rumors in Peiping and Tianjin, the general public expected bond prices to plummet due to the urgency of the external threat. Most focused on shorting, leading to an increasing number of short positions. However, the longs seemed weak, and poised to waver. But after the settlement, there was no selling off. This revealed that capitalists were a backbone. Short sellers covered their positions due to a lack of hope. The increase in the foreign market was detached from the current situation, but this was not by chance. A breakdown of each day’s trend follows.</p>
<p>(Tuesday) The first day after settlement, the market heard the government was appropriating 20% of bond funds for war expenses, retail investors sold short, and big players bought low, making prices weaken slightly, 3 to 5 jiao, contrary to shorts' expectations.</p>
<p>(Wednesday) The rumors of Japanese attacks on Tianjin intensified, and inexperienced investors shorted further. Prices were soft from morning to evening, but supply and demand were balanced, and the market only dropped slightly, 3 or 4 jiao. The salt tax also rose 2 jiao. Short sellers gradually shifted, anticipating a short squeeze, as the attack on Tianjin had not materialized.</p>
<p>(Thursday) Northern investors were the first to see the opportunity and began to cover their positions amidst the tense wartime atmosphere. Prices steadily rose, leaving retail short sellers in a dilemma.</p>
<p>(Friday) Suddenly, news broke that three Chinese representatives in Geneva had resigned. Savvy retail investors took the opportunity to cover their short positions, and prices fell before rebounding. Northern buyers were particularly aggressive, and the market rose another yuan.</p>
<p>(Saturday) Due to high prices, real goods were sold, causing early trading to rise, but the market could not sustain momentum. Some longs took profits, leading to a pullback, falling 7 or 8 jiao.</p>
<p>Overall, longs profited from the week. The main reason for the rising trend was too many retail short sellers, while large long positions remained unchanged. A lack of supplies in the market led to the unusual situation that was opposite of the current crisis. As a result, the bonds continued to rise by several jiao to over one yuan compared to the previous week. The total trading volume was 30,175,000 yuan. A table showing the highs, lows, rises, and falls follows.</p>

<p>Foodstuffs Market: Superior Rice Down Another 10 to 20 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were still rice shipments to the Shanghai North Rice Market. Rice from Nanbang arrived in Shanghai from Xiaogang, but there were no arrivals from Dangxi. Factory warehouses were eager to sell, resulting in weak market conditions for both unpolished and polished superior rice, with prices declining another 10 to 20 cents. There was some trading in thin early rice, with stable prices. Foreign rice also saw some trading. Yin Yuan and Bai Yuan weakened by nearly one jiao.</p>

<p>Silk, Tea, and Rayon Recent Exports Booming</p>
<p>Over 500 crates were exported last week, most of which were sent to Yangtze River ports. Recently, various silk merchants, mindful of the tense situation, actively shipped out their February futures contracts that had been transferred to them by foreign firms, in batches. Last week, various liners shipped out a total of more than 530 crates of rayon to various countries, with the Yangtze River route being the most popular.</p>

<p>Setting up the Silkworm and Mulberry Improvement Association, to be Established on the 15th of This Month</p>
<p>In light of the deteriorating state of silkworm and mulberry cultivation in the urban areas, the Hangzhou Municipal Government has initiated the organization of a Silkworm and Mulberry Improvement Committee. Representatives appointed by the Municipal Government, as well as district chiefs from various districts, and silk-related organizations, will serve as ex-officio members. In addition, individuals with extensive knowledge and experience in the silkworm, mulberry, and silk industries will be invited to serve as specialized committee members to jointly devise solutions. The committee will have two sections: propaganda and guidance. Five executive committee members will be elected by the members. The official establishment is scheduled for the 15th of this month. It is reported that He Shangping, a technician from the Shanghai Joint Silkworm and Mulberry Improvement Association, and Chu Fucheng, a leader in the silk cocoon industry, have both been invited to serve as specialized committee members. A preparatory committee will first be held in Hangzhou tomorrow (Tuesday) to discuss implementation methods for improving silkworm rearing, mulberry planting, and related matters.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Hardware and Cement Prices Plunge by Fifty Cents <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Cement Market: Since the establishment of domestic cement companies such as Qixin and Huashang Taishan, shipments have been smooth and sufficient. Foreign brands like Qingzhou Asano Jianglong have been phased out, and merchants can no longer come to Shanghai. In the last 5 or 6 years, the cement market in this city has been controlled by the Chinese. However, in the beginning, the companies competed with each other, and the prices went down. After there was coordination, each company agreed to raise prices (the name is: National Cement Company), so for the past three or four years, the price has not changed. However, the price decreased by 50 cents yesterday, which surprised many people. According to investigations, each company has different opinions, so they are separating in an intangible way. Thus, prices in the coming days are likely to differ. Currently, a horse brand cement bucket is priced at 4 liang and 5 qian (unchanged), while a bag is priced at 3 liang and 4 qian and a half (dropped 50 cents). Elephant brand cement buckets are also priced at 4 liang and 5 qian, while bags are priced at 3 liang and 4 qian (both with an additional factory tax of 6 jiao). It is reported that transactions have recently decreased, presumably because buyers are adopting a wait-and-see approach.</p>

<p>Zhang and He Confer on Recovery Plan</p>
<p>Our Troops Outside Gubeikou Have Advanced on Multiple Fronts. Enemy Aircraft Bombing at Xifengkou and Gubeikou. Zhang Xueliang to Depart for the Front to Supervise the War.</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhang Xueliang and He Yingqin spent a long time last night discussing the recovery plan. In addition to severely punishing those responsible for defending the territory, Zhang has decided to depart for the front line to command and supervise the counterattack, determined to fight the enemy to the end. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Our troops outside Gubeikou have built solid trenches. The morning before, our troops advanced on multiple fronts in a counterattack. The left wing reached Qing Shi Lin, and the right wing crossed Anjiang Camp, advancing along the Han'erling Ridge. Commander Sun Zhengfang is commanding at the front line. It is reported this morning that they have already made contact with the enemy. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the morning of the 6th, enemy aircraft continued to bomb Gubeikou, Xifengkou, and other locations. Our troops' new defense line along the Great Wall has been established and is ready for a counterattack within days. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) He Yingqin telegraphed the Central Government yesterday, requesting a clear order to strip Tang of his position and investigate him. Tang plans to flee to Dolon Nor, and it is reported that a unit has been dispatched to intercept him. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Rehe Provincial Government has been changed to the Kawabara Brigade headquarters. Traitor Zhang Hai Peng has arrived in Chengde. The Japanese plan to transform Rehe into the Xing'an Province and appoint Zhang Hai Peng as chairman. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The area around Lengkou, Lulong, and Qian'an is heavily guarded. The Japanese have already made preparations at various points along the Great Wall. News reports indicate that an advance unit of Japanese troops has arrived at Lengkou, intending to block the retreat of our troops at the front. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Chiang's telegram arrived in Peiping tonight, ordering the Northeast Army to continue resisting. Zhang Zuoxi's troops at Gubeikou, Wan Fulin's troops at Pingquan, and Sun Dianying's troops at Chifeng were concentrated and divided into five routes to counterattack Chengde. Upon receiving Chiang's telegram, Zhang ordered the front-line troops to concentrate at strategic locations for a final stand. Japanese advance teams moved towards the Peiping-Rehe highway. Small numbers of enemy troops have been spotted near Kalatun and have made contact with our troops. Our troops have built solid trenches twenty miles northeast of Gubeikou, using Great Wall bricks and stones. Defensive works have also been built in the Anziling area. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) A Reuters special correspondent, reporting from Gubeikou, said that yesterday he saw Tang Yulin traveling lightly in a car towards Gubeikou. Yesterday, Japanese planes bombed Gubeikou, but there were no casualties. Temporary field hospitals are visible along the road to Gubeikou, and the staff in each hospital are very busy treating the wounded. The entire city of Gubeikou is crowded with soldiers and civilians. Today, a regiment of reinforcements entered Rehe, establishing a defense line twenty miles inside the border to block the Japanese advance. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) There is still fighting on the Rehe front today. The Chinese troops in Rehe are currently retreating in three directions: one group is retreating west from Chifeng into Dolon Nor in Chahar; one is concentrating at Gubeikou from Chengde; and one is retreating to Xifengkou from Lingyuan. These Chinese troops are constantly threatened by Japanese aircraft during their retreat, so their movement is extremely rapid. At the same time, Japanese aircraft are preventing Chinese troops from advancing towards Chengde because the number of Japanese troops in Chengde is still small. The Japanese troops who entered Chengde yesterday received reinforcements from the Suzuki Brigade in the afternoon. Although Zhang Xueliang's troops have suffered many casualties, they are still willing to fight. They may engage in another fierce battle between Chengde and Gubeikou. The 60,000 Chinese troops currently concentrated at Gubeikou have been ordered to advance twenty miles into Rehe and are building new positions there. Zhang Xueliang's direct troops, numbering 20,000, participated in this battle in Rehe, and the whereabouts of most of them are now unknown. Tang Yulin's troops are currently retreating in a disorderly manner, and many boxes of ammunition have not yet been opened or unloaded, but are being transported back by camel convoys. Zhang Xueliang received a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek ordering him to continue fighting. All the troops in the province have been strictly ordered to fight. Song Ziwen and other government leaders will soon arrive in Peiping to take charge of everything. Tang Yulin's whereabouts are still unclear. Today, Zhang Xueliang's spokesman firmly denied rumors that Chahar had been in contact with the "Manchukuo" about annexation, and said that Chahar is currently making military preparations within its provincial borders and will defend itself by force if Japanese troops invade. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

The Japanese army launched a general offensive on the 22nd, using armored vehicles and small tanks to charge forward, covering the advance of the infantry. The enemy's artillery fire was extremely fierce. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely and resisted until the 26th, when the Japanese Allied Forces' main force from Chaoyang launched a fierce attack on our rear.

<p>(Peiping) Those who escaped from Chengde say that one night Tang heard that Cui Xingwu had already reached a compromise with the rebel Shao Benliang and was preparing to surrender to the puppet state. Tang immediately asked Cui about this via long-distance telephone. The reply was, "You owe me wages and don't pay them, so there's nothing else to talk about." On the morning of the 2nd, Tang convened a meeting of important officials of the Rehe Provincial Government and representatives of local organizations. Tang expressed his determination to leave Rehe. After the meeting, he received a telegram from Zhang ordering him to hold firm. Tang then ordered Tang Yuming of the 19th Artillery Regiment to lead his troops to hold the Hongshilaling, nine miles from Chengde. After Tang's regiment arrived at that location, they demanded unpaid wages. Tang ordered that each person be given two yuan, but they refused. He then increased the amount to two yuan, but as soon as the money was distributed, a mutiny erupted, and the troops scattered. The rest also deserted. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Our Troops in Northern Rehe, Sun Dianying and Weng Zhaoyuan's Units, Have Fallen into Desperate Straits</p>
<p>With No Supplies, No Communication, and Unable to Retreat into Chahar Province</p>
<p>After the fall of Chengde, our troops in northern Rehe, such as Sun Dianying and Weng Zhaoyuan's units, lost contact and were cut off from supplies, causing national outrage. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency went to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters yesterday morning to visit Commander Dai and inquire about his views on this matter. Commander Dai was out on official business, so the reporter was received by Secretary Xu and met with Staff Officer Cheng of the department. According to his expression, Cheng, who is knowledgeable in military affairs, said that the fall of Chengde and the lack of supplies and communication for our troops in northern Rehe have truly put them in desperate straits. Retreating into Chahar Province is very difficult. As for Weng Zhaoyuan, there has been no telegram from him recently, and his whereabouts are unknown. The reporter then visited Central Committee Member Wu Tiecheng at the Municipal Government. According to him, those responsible for the Rehe army's failure to resist for a long time cannot shirk their responsibility. Minister He Jingzhi telegraphed that he had arrived in Peiping, which means the central government has a great determination on this military campaign, and it would not accept any threat from the Japanese Empire. The public order of Peiping and Tianjin will be in safety.</p>

The known results are as follows: National Socialist Party 288, Social Democratic Party 120, Communist Party 79, Centre Party 70, German National People's Party 52, Bavarian People's Party 20, German National Party 6. The number of seats for the German People's Party and the Christian Social People's Party are not yet confirmed.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 6th – The final election results were announced around 2:00 AM this morning as follows: National Socialist Party 288 seats, Social Democratic Party 120 seats, Communist Party 79 seats, Centre Party 71 seats, German National People's Party 52 seats, Bavarian People's Party 20 seats, Christian Social People's Party 6 seats, German National Party 6 seats, German Party 7 seats.

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 6th – The German general election concluded yesterday at 6:00 PM, and vote counting began immediately. Voter turnout was approximately 80% of the total electorate. The country was relatively peaceful, with only two reported deaths due to conflicts. In the Breslau area, one National Socialist auxiliary policeman was shot and killed, and several others were injured. Police indicated that the shots were fired from a certain house and subsequently fired machine guns from armored vehicles at the house, eventually dragging out all the occupants. In the Affenbar area, there was one death and one injury. In Weimar, a conflict also occurred between National Socialists and Communists, resulting in one National Socialist being seriously injured and nine Communists being arrested. Berlin was calm. Only 41 people were arrested last night, a significant decrease compared to November of last year. However, many Communists were still arrested in various provinces. 20,000 members of the Stahlhelm League marched in formation yesterday afternoon. Crowds cheered them, and they gathered in front of the former Royal Palace, where their leader addressed them before they dispersed. Yesterday, Berlin saw fewer Republican flags and other similar flags, but more flags of the old German Empire than before.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hamburg, 6th – Upon the order of Interior Minister Frick, the National Socialist Party took over the police administration of the Free City of Hamburg today. National Socialists have now taken over the municipal government. The mayor of Hamburg and the president of the Senate have both resigned. The Hamburg authorities have traditionally been a group opposed to the National Socialist Party; this marks their failure.</p>

<p>Roosevelt Calls Special Session of Congress</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 5th – Following an emergency meeting today, the US Cabinet announced the decision to convene a special session of Congress on Thursday. President Roosevelt then stated that he is preparing a temporary procedure to address the financial crisis. It is expected that Congress's first action will be to quickly pass a bill to permit the supervision of the national banking industry and improvement of the system, to restore confidence.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 6th – The New York Daily News's Washington dispatch stated that, according to a key Democratic figure in the White House yesterday, the United States will abolish the gold standard tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 6th – Close aides to President Roosevelt predict that banks will close until March 13th to prevent cash from being hoarded or taken abroad. The claim in the Daily News that the United States will abolish the gold standard tomorrow has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 5th – Southern California announced a seven-day bank holiday for all banks in the state today.</p>
<p>Reuters, Havana, 5th – Cuban President Machado has announced a three-day bank holiday for all banks, starting today.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 5th – Many places in the United States are considering issuing clearinghouse certificates and the like to replace cash. New York has already printed clearinghouse certificates, scheduled for issuance on March 7th. Treasury Secretary Woodin conferred with important bankers and merchants in Washington today, but the results of the meeting were not made public. News from here tonight indicates that Cuba and Puerto Rico are both affected by the US banking crisis. The President of Cuba has announced a three-day bank holiday, during which all transactions will be suspended. Puerto Rico will suspend bank payments for three days starting March 6th.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 5th – Before convening a meeting with the old Treasury Secretary and the banking community, the new Treasury Secretary Woodin secretly consulted with Meyer, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. The new Treasury Secretary kept the matter strictly confidential, even refusing to disclose who participated in the meeting. What was discussed is even more unknown. However, it is generally believed that two issues must have been discussed: (1) the Federal Reserve's plan to issue paper money, and (2) the Clearinghouse's request to issue small bills to replace currency. The ban on exports is limited to the domestic withdrawal of cash. The closure of state banks will be for a very short period. We still remember that during the war, the US government defined "those who trade with the enemy" and prohibited the export of cash. Afterwards, Congress did not repeal it. Therefore, Roosevelt can still re-employ this method. It is said that the new Treasury Secretary intends to meet with Roosevelt. After the new and old Treasury Secretaries met with the banking community, some congressmen believed that Roosevelt's speech yesterday seemed to clearly indicate that cash payments would be prohibited. Now foreign countries will not withdraw cash, even if the United States abandons the gold standard. However, for some time, American commercial groups and people have had a strong trend of transporting cash to foreign countries, especially to Canada, and the US government may inevitably prohibit it.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 5th – The new Secretary of the Treasury, Woodin, will convene a meeting tomorrow morning with former Secretary of the Treasury Mills, other Treasury officials, members of the Federal Reserve Board, and fifteen important bankers to discuss the banking situation and its relationship to the gold standard. After the meeting, Woodin and other government officials will meet with the new President Roosevelt at the White House. According to well-informed sources, the United States will take extraordinary measures to save the panic. This evening, Roosevelt will issue a proclamation explaining the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e235">US Financial Crisis Impacts Japan <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>Exchange Transactions Suspended, Gold Export Prohibited, Securities Market Shaken</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th – The impact of the US financial panic on the Japanese economy is being viewed by the financial community as follows: Major exports to the US, such as raw silk, have been significantly affected. Exchange banks, except for the surplus, mostly transfer overseas funds to London. The impact of the panic should not be very great. If the US prohibits gold exports, it will be a major blow. Exchange rate fluctuations are even more expected. There is widespread talk of the US dollar rising to 25 or 30 US dollars. If the US dollar rises to 25 US dollars at this time, the calculation of exports and imports will change by more than 20%, and the securities market will inevitably experience turmoil and be adversely affected.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th – Regarding the panic in all banks, the Director of the Financial Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, Tomita, and others still went to the ministry to work on Sunday, collecting information. As a result of the discussion, their unanimous view is as follows: The United States will surely implement the so-called expansionary policy to a considerable extent, but will probably not stop the gold standard. Indeed, a temporary suspension of convertibility may be implemented as a response, but a ban on gold exports is a last resort and will not be implemented until absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th – Due to the impact of the US financial panic, Japanese exchange banks have decided to suspend exchange transactions today. Bank transactions other than exchange will continue as usual. Also, the Tokyo Stock Exchange opened a joint committee at 7:30 this morning and decided to close the market before and after lunch. The same applies to Osaka and Nagoya. Therefore, except for rice, all futures markets have decided to close simultaneously today.</p>
<p>Japan United, Tokyo, 6th – All overseas markets held emergency meetings yesterday due to the economic panic in the United States. As a result, all exchanges except rice have suspended operations today.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 6th – All stock exchanges are closed today. If the situation does not improve, they may not be able to reopen tomorrow. Today, all commodity exchanges except the rice market are closed. There are also no foreign exchange rates quoted.</p>

<h3 id="e237">National Government's Memorial Week <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Dai Chuanxian Reports on the Intentions of the Japanese</p>
<p>(Nanjing) – The National Government held a memorial week at 9:00 AM on the 6th. Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Niu Yongjian, Jing Tingyi, Zhou Zhenlin, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Yongbin, Chen Shuren, Liang Hancao, Chen Shaokuan, He Yaozu, Huang Musong, Chen Yi, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and more than 500 National Government employees attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Dai Chuanxian reported, stating that the recent resolution of the League of Nations has made clear Japan's invasion of us, and the right and wrong has been clarified to the world. However, in the past two weeks, Japan's attacks have become increasingly fierce. From before the September 18th Incident to the present, the Japanese have known that their actions are illegal and violate justice, but they still act recklessly. If judgment based on words and justice could make Japan realize, things would not be as they are today. I remember being ordered to go to Japan in 1927 and staying in Tokyo for more than 60 days, giving more than 80 public lectures. After each lecture, I would debate with the audience, and eventually, most Japanese people deeply understood the principles of our party, which were very proper, and expressed great admiration. As I was about to leave Japan, I heard that the Revolutionary Army had recaptured Nanjing, and at this time, the Japanese military authorities suddenly invited me to a banquet. During the banquet, the host gave a toast, saying that they greatly admired the principles advocated by Mr. and the theories of the Kuomintang. Now, your country's revolutionary regime has been listed on the international stage, but there is still one thing to say, that the prosperity of a country does not depend on talking, but on having the power to do it. Japan's existence today is entirely built by fighting. I respectfully propose a toast and wish you all the best. When he spoke, his expression was extremely fierce and cold. This kind of feeling and impression has never been forgotten. The expression at that time had already foreseen the fact of the invasion of our country today. Now the world is clear about the right and wrong of Japan's invasion of us. To make this judgment effective, only we Chinese people can thoroughly make efforts to reach the goal. Especially in the past two weeks, having personally experienced this kind of violence, there is no way to say it nicely. Therefore, I brought up the image of that small banquet in Japan at that time to talk about, so that you know the intentions of the Japanese and their views on right and wrong, based on their own responsibilities and seeing the future very clearly. I hope all comrades will be vigilant. The ceremony was completed at 10:00 AM. (6th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Zhu and Mao Flee to Dongshao and Are Intercepted</p>
<p>Hunan Army Recovers Ninggang</p>
<p>Chiang Reissues Bounty Order for Bandit Chiefs</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The communist bandits of the pseudo 135th Army Corps, pseudo 22nd Army of Zhu and Mao, and the pseudo 10th Army of Fang Shao, and the pseudo Soviet independent divisions stationed in various places in southeastern Jiangxi and northwestern Fujian, concentrated their forces to invade Lichuan last month. After failing, they turned to Nancheng. At that time, the Mao and Li divisions stationed in Liangnan defended the city and fought fiercely with the bandits for more than ten days, finally repelling the bandits. The bandits, unable to succeed, crossed the southern part of Yihuang from the Xiong Village Dangkou and the Ganzhu Kuzhu areas south of Guangchang, and fled southwest into the Dongshao, Luokou, Wangpi, Xiaopu area of the communist nest in Ningdu. After Chiang received the report, he ordered Luo Zhuoying's troops to leave Yihuang Le'an and cut off their route to Ningdu. Recently, the Provincial Government received a winter telegram from the Communist District Party Affairs Office, stating that our army fought the main force of the bandits for three days in Huangpi, south of Yihuang, near Ningdu Guangchang, killing thousands of bandits, seizing more than 2,000 guns, and capturing countless prisoners. Based on this, the bandits' plan to flee to Ningdu failed again.</p>
<p>Ninggang Yongxin in western Jiangxi, bordering Ling County in Hunan, is the birthplace of Zhu, Mao, and Peng. Currently, there is still a unit of the pseudo Third Army, a unit of the pseudo Eighth Army, and the pseudo Independent 12th Division and Guard Division entrenched in the area, led by Li Tianzhu, the communist bandit leader of western Jiangxi and eastern Hunan. They have also recruited scattered bandits from western Jiangxi and eastern Hunan into pseudo independent regiments and guerrilla teams, etc., and often harass the counties of Chongyi, Shangyou, Suichuan, Wan'an, Taihe, Anfu, and Lianhua. It is heard that Chairman Chiang is also planning to advance and suppress the bandits in this area, so he has ordered the Guangdong Army's Li Zhenqiu Division to advance from Shangyou Chongyi towards Suichuan, the Hunan Army's Tao Guang Division to advance from Pingxiang towards Lianhua, and the Jiangxi Army's Wang Maode to advance from the west bank of the Gan River towards the Hunan border, while the eastern Hunan's Wang Dongyuan is also out of the Jiangxi border to intercept. This plan was implemented last month, and all armies have made progress, and the bandit nests of Qixiaqi, Wudoujiang, and Huang'ao have been successively recovered. After the royal army recovered Yamenqian in southwestern Suichuan, the pseudo 22nd, 23rd, and 24th divisions of the pseudo Eighth Army, with about 3,000 guns, counterattacked more than ten times from Xinjiangou, but were all repelled by the royal army, killing more than 300 bandits. The Zhang Brigade of the division captured Cigamping on the border of Ninggang on the 20th of last month, and taking advantage of the victory, advanced and recovered the city of Ninggang, which had been captured by the bandits for six years, on the 21st. The remaining bandits retreated into Yongxin, and Tao's division has already advanced from Pingxiang towards Yongxin to attack them.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang believes that the bandit chiefs Zhu and Mao willingly fawn on foreigners, so he has reiterated the bounty order, and his order is as follows: [After investigating, bandit chiefs Zhu De and others willingly fawn on foreigners, act as accomplices to evil, harm the country and the people, and have long been wanted. This chairman has been ordered to supervise the suppression and has the determination to eliminate the red bandits and bears the important responsibility of internal pacification and foreign resistance. It is urgent to reissue a circular order, offering rewards for their arrest and clarifying the punishment. For this purpose, it is ordered that the subordinates be instructed to earnestly and strictly arrest them. This order, (1) those who capture the pseudo First Front Army Commander Zhu De and the General Political Commissar Zhou Lai will be given a reward of 200,000 yuan. Those who cut off their heads and offer them will be rewarded with the same amount after being proven to be correct. (1) Those who capture the pseudo First Army Corps Commander Peng Dehuai, General Political Commissar Nie Rongzhen, pseudo Third Army Corps Commander Lin Biao, General Political Commissar Teng Daiyuan, pseudo Fifth Army Corps Commander Dong Zhentang, General Political Commissar Xiao Dongguang will each be given a reward of 100,000 yuan. Those who cut off their heads and offer them will be rewarded with the same amount after being proven to be correct (1) Those who capture the pseudo First Army Corps Political Department Director Luo Ronghuan, Deputy Director Li Zhuoran, pseudo Third Army Corps Political Department Director Zeng Risan, pseudo Fifth Army Corps Political Department Director Xiao Bojian will each be given a reward of 50,000 yuan. Those who cut off their heads and offer them will be rewarded with the same amount after being proven to be correct. (March 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e256">Measures by Hunan Provincial Government to Prohibit the Issuance of Paper Money <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Those Already Issued Must Be Recalled Within Six Months</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: It is a common practice in various counties and cities in Hunan Province that any company, store, vendor, or household with a little credit can print city tickets and issue them indiscriminately without any restrictions. Once business declines and there are losses, they go bankrupt, harming society, disrupting finance, and having a great impact. The provincial government has repeatedly ordered strict prohibition and circulated orders to all printing offices not to accept printing orders. However, the stores, due to their own interests, do not hesitate to disrupt finance and disregard the law, and continue to issue tickets, resulting in an increase in paper money and a shortage of cash. Therefore, with the recent establishment of the Hunan Branch of the Coin Revolution Association, people suspected that the association was issuing paper money and rushed to transfer cash out of the area, causing panic in the society, a sharp increase in interest rates, and a tight financial situation. After the provincial government repeatedly explained that the association was a private organization engaged in academic research and not an agency issuing paper money, people's hearts finally stabilized. From this, it can be seen that the public's faith in paper money has been lost. Therefore, the provincial government has specially stipulated twelve measures, that all paper money that has been issued and not approved by the Ministry of Finance and the provincial government must be recalled within six months from March 1st. If it is reissued, the circumstances will be considered and confiscated and punished. The order has been circulated to all counties for implementation. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: These measures are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 and Article 6 of the Regulations on Suppressing Paper Money, which have been approved for reference by the National Government. Article 2: All printed or handwritten paper money that does not contain the name of the payee and the payment period and is redeemable for taels of silver, silver dollars, silver coins, or copper coins, regardless of the name used (such as wage coupons, circulation coupons, loan coupons, etc.), are recognized as paper money. Article 3: After the promulgation of these measures, all government agencies, silver shops, companies, stores, and households in this province must not issue paper money without the approval of the Ministry of Finance or this provincial government.

<p>Deputy Commander Xu Jingde Already Arrived to Meet Him</p>
<p>Xu Talks About the Arduous Anti-Japanese Battles in Heilongjiang Province</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after General Ma Zhanshan left Heilongjiang for Russia, all of General Ma's troops were handed over to Xu Jingde, the acting Deputy Commander of Heilongjiang Province. Mr. Xu recently heard that General Ma was about to return to China. Therefore, he made a detour from Heilongjiang to Shanghai to meet with General Ma before returning to his defense area to plan the recovery of lost territory. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Xu at his residence and inquired about the recent situation in Heilongjiang Province. Mr. Xu graciously received the reporter and gave a detailed reply as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e258">Account of Arduous Battles <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Xu, he is a native of Northeast China and belongs to the military. Since the September 18th Incident, Chairman Ma Zhanshan took charge of the Jiang administration and engaged in anti-Japanese work. Mr. Xu was personally involved in the Jiangqiao and Daxing battles. On the 4th of last month, Chairman Ma went to Heihe to re-establish the provincial government. Soon after, he led the troops to set off. At that time, he appointed Mr. Xu as the Heihe Garrison Commander and Acting Deputy Commander, staying behind to coordinate various routes. For several months, over thousands of miles up and down the Heihe River, Mr. Xu had been trying to advance while defending. The southern route advanced into Nenjiang to spy on Nehe, and the eastern route advanced into Luobei to plan for Suibin. The two routes in the middle were repeatedly attacked by the enemy, but they were repelled. Suibin, a fundamental place, was once recovered, and the defense was consolidated. However, Heihe has always been known as a barren border area, with severe shortages of food and various materials. In particular, the only necessary military supplies, bullets, were not available. Troops and volunteer armies along all routes requested supplies and ammunition one after another, causing a great sense of exhaustion. It took a lot of effort to cope with it for several months, and Heihe became increasingly empty. At that time, Chairman Ma was stationed in Nehe, planning to attack the Harbin station. On one hand, he telegraphed Hailar, Zhalantun, and the Su and Zhang armies to mobilize, and he personally went to discuss strategies, hoping to advance together and recover the provincial capital. However, as soon as Chairman Ma arrived in Zhalantun, the situation changed. Chairman Ma was isolated and unable to return, so he retreated into Russian territory via Manzhouli, hoping to return to China and plan a major offensive.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Waiting for the Opportunity to Act <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>However, after the enemy resolved the situation in Haiman, they concentrated their forces to attack Heihe. Mr. Xu originally planned to concentrate his troops to defend the Xing'an Mountains and fight the Japanese invaders to the death. However, the supplies and ammunition were severely lacking. Although he had the determination to die, he lacked the means to fight the enemy. As a last resort, he handed over the various troops under his command to Chief of Staff Wang and various brigade commanders to be responsible for maintaining order, and secretly instructed them to lie dormant in various counties for the time being, totaling more than 16,000 people, instructing them to wait for the opportunity to act. As for other units, there were still Commander Pu Bingshan, Army of Cai Hongyou, Army of Nan Tingfang, troops of Zhang Xishi, and troops of Xu Haiting, totaling 50,000 to 60,000 people. They were also out of ammunition and food, and their clothing was thin, making it impossible to fight. They were lying dormant in various counties. Xu Haiting, who was not performing well, should be brought to a meeting for disciplinary action. Article 10: 50% of the fines imposed by county governments according to Article 7 of these measures may be used to fund the suppression of paper money, and the remaining 50% should be submitted to the case and taken as a record. Article 11: Matters not covered by these measures may be modified by the Provincial Government Committee. Article 12: These measures shall be implemented after being promulgated by the Provincial Government Committee.</p>
<p>Army Commander Zhang Xishi, due to his advanced age, fought hard in the Laha station and Nehe area for several days. He suffered rheumatism in his arm and has already come to Shanghai for medical treatment. Army Commander Zhang Xishi is also said to have arrived in Peiping, requesting relief.</p>

<p>Mr. Xu heard that Chairman Ma was about to arrive in Shanghai to discuss with the central government and the military authorities in North China a complete plan to recover the lost territories. Mr. Xu disguised himself, changed his name, and made a detour to Shanghai via Vladivostok. He is now suffering from heart disease due to excessive stimulation and plans to recuperate in Shanghai for a while. After Chairman Ma returns to China, he will follow him again to discuss ways to save the situation. However, he regretted that he was a soldier and was responsible for important military affairs, but failed to defend a corner of the border, causing the Heilongjiang provincial government to retreat. He was extremely ashamed. This time, he left in tears, feeling very sad and indignant, so he did not want to express much to the press. He was compelled to give an account of the experience due to inquiries. Chairman Ma has now left Vornosk and should be able to arrive in Shanghai in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>General Post Office Has Not Received Report from Tianjin Post Office</p>
<p>Suspension is of a Temporary Nature</p>
<p>After the news of the fall of Chengde reached Shanghai, the parcel section of the Shanghai Postal Administration stopped accepting parcels to Jehol today morning, while letters are still accepted, but only a very small number. As of yesterday afternoon, the General Post Office had not received a report from the Tianjin Post Office regarding postal services in Jehol, so the General Post Office had not issued an order to stop sending mail to Jehol. The suspension of these parcels is only a temporary measure. In the future, the items that should be suspended and accepted regarding mail in Jehol will be determined after the Tianjin Post Office reports to Shanghai and formulates methods. According to Kang Yong, a standing committee member of the Postal Workers' Union, the union has telegraphed the Peiping Workers' Union to find a way to evacuate the postal workers in Jehol in batches to ensure their safety, and there should be no danger.</p>

<p>Non-War Members Raise Funds to Assist Sailors and Prevent Ships from Helping Japanese Troops Invade</p>
<p>(London) The British Anti-War Association held a meeting today. The chairman announced that a ship was about to leave for Japan. If the crew could get financial help from the Anti-War Association, they would decide to leave the ship. A resolution was immediately made to raise funds from members, totaling about 200 pounds in English currency. According to the report, the ship, the Stanleyville, was recently sold to Japan by Belgium and is currently berthed in Wales. Its crew telegraphed: [If the crew is given financial assistance by the Anti-War Association, they are prepared to leave the ship, otherwise they will have no place to live. The crew are all people of color. It is scheduled to leave for Japan at 5 PM tonight. The ship carries a white pilot who intends to join the Japanese Air Force. Reply immediately.] The association, in view of the urgency of the situation, advocated immediate fundraising. As a result, silver dollars and copper coins rained down, and they were carried in trade union flags and men's and women's hats. Representatives were then dispatched to meet with the sailors in Wales with the funds. They will return here tomorrow to report on the negotiations. (April 4, North China Daily News telegram)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Northeastern Volunteer Army Relief Association received the following aid messages from various parties the day before yesterday:</p>
<p>Student Entertainment Association Yesterday, the Shanghai Student Theater Troupe sent a letter to the Northeastern Volunteer Army Relief Association, saying: Dear Sirs, Upon receiving the notice from the general assembly on March 3 that the national crisis is serious and the volunteer army is struggling without support, we are launching a Shanghai student theater troupe to aid the Northeastern Volunteer Army entertainment conference, scheduled to be held from March 6 to 8 at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association for public performance. We hereby request your association to send a representative to attend the opening day to report on the recent anti-Japanese situation of the Northeastern Volunteer Army, etc. Therefore, the standing committee has decided to nominate Mr. Wu Shan, a standing director, as a representative to participate in the opening report of your association. A special letter is hereby sent to you.</p>
<p>Tea Dance Donation The association received a letter from the Chinese Dance Research Association the day before yesterday, stating that the association has scheduled a tea dance party from 5 PM to 8 PM on the afternoon of March 10 at the Honey Sweet Dance Hall at the intersection of Avenue Soeur and Avenue Joffre. The colleagues plan to donate half of the ticket revenue after expenses to the Northeastern Volunteer Army. We hereby inform you.</p>
<p>Subscription Donation The association replied to the Kang Jian Monthly Magazine yesterday, stating that upon receiving your letter, we respectfully learned that your newspaper intends to donate one silver dollar from each full-year subscription fee received from March 1 to the Northeastern Volunteer Army. Your enthusiasm and friendship are deeply appreciated. The standing committee has decided to extend its sincere thanks to the Northeastern Volunteer Army on behalf of the Northeastern Volunteer Army. We hope that you will deliver the new subscription donations to major banks in installments to obtain receipts from our association, which will be transferred to the front line to assist the volunteer army. A special reply is hereby sent to you.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Guo Chengen Talks About the Situation After the Opening of the Mint <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Five days have passed since the Central Mint opened on March 1. In order to understand the situation since the opening, the reporter visited Director Guo Chengen of the factory this morning to inquire about the factory's output and work situation. The conversation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Trial Period According to Mr. Guo, although the factory has already opened, it is still in the trial period, so the number of coins that can be produced each day has not yet been determined. There are two reasons for this: (1) Most of the required equipment, such as models, etc., are purchased from abroad. The factory now plans to research and manufacture them itself. (2) Most of the workers are newly recruited and are not familiar with coin-making work. Without a certain period of practical training, it is difficult to become proficient. Therefore, although the factory has already opened, it cannot be considered formal due to the above two reasons. Even when President Song came to the factory to inspect the day before yesterday, he believed that it would not be possible without a six-month trial.</p>
<p>Insufficient Expenses The raw silver for making coins is completely delivered by the Central Bank, and the silver coins minted are all made for the central government. The factory only earns a handling fee. Therefore, it will not be profitable unless it produces 300,000 yuan per day. According to my hope, we can gradually transform and increase the minting of silver coins to replace copper coins and manufacture various badges in the future to support the factory's expenses and prevent losses. But things are not easy and cannot be done in a short time.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Writes to the American Chamber of Commerce Requesting that the US Tobacco Industry Monopoly Be Stopped <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce wrote to the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai yesterday, stating that on March 3, the Chinese Cigarette Factory Association sent a letter stating that the members of the association's cigarette factories purchased tobacco leaves from American tobacco companies, and the pricing, payment period, and gold and ocean settlement of tobacco leaves were based on the agreements reached with the brokers. Now, the tobacco companies have organized the American Tobacco Association, which uses high-pressure tactics to force the cigarette factories to directly sign trade contracts with the association. If they do not comply, the tobacco companies will stop supplying tobacco leaves. This is close to a monopoly and makes the cigarette factories subject to restrictions at every turn. In order to maintain the factory's operations and the livelihood of the workers, the cigarette factories have to temporarily endure the pain and accept it in order to maintain the status quo, and then seek a proper solution through proper procedures. It is found that the tobacco companies sell goods to the cigarette factories, and even if there are contracts, they are handled directly by the companies and factories, and there is no contract signed with the factories in the name of the association. Even more worrying is that if any cigarette factory does not comply with the association's methods, the association will notify the companies to stop supplying tobacco leaves to the factory. Sales and purchases are originally free, so how can a third party interfere? If the companies change their articles of association or the association has business rules, the association should notify its members to negotiate with the cigarette factories, and both parties should have absolute freedom to trade or not, which has nothing to do with third parties. Now, the association is overstepping its authority and using high-pressure tactics to intimidate with blockades, which is not the way of trade. If this is taken as a precedent, then if there is any dispute between the factory and the company in the future, there will be no way to remedy it by resorting to law. The association, at the request of its members, has already written to the association for an explanation, but has not received a reply. Therefore, we are writing to your association again, asking you to forward it to the American Chamber of Commerce and quickly find a way to correct it together. The practice of the tobacco companies concluding contracts through the American Tobacco Association makes it impossible for the Chinese cigarette factories to compare and choose. The method is unfair. Your association should know that there is no such method in Chinese foreign trade and trade between various countries and China. Your country's tobacco industry is the only one that advocates this monopoly policy, which is enough to cause repercussions in the Sino-US commercial undertaking that has great hope in the future. At present, there are many countries that are dumping at low prices in trade with China. This monopoly policy may maintain its superior position in the tobacco industry because there is still little competition. However, if it loses the sympathy of the Chinese merchants as a result, it is difficult to guarantee that other commodities will not be controlled by this policy. Therefore, the tobacco companies only consider their tobacco business, and your association should consider the overall trade with China. We hope that you will be able to mediate in a righteous manner so that this monopoly policy can be eliminated, which is a blessing for the future of commerce between the two countries. To the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Detectives Li Pengfei and Jin Wanrong of the Yulin Road Police Station, together with Detective Hander from the Western Police Station, arrested bandits near Longjiang Road and Weituoma Road at around 5 PM yesterday. Both sides exchanged gunfire. As a result, six people from Funing, Jiangbei, Deng Sanzi, Chen Zikui, Wang San, Sun Da, Yang Dabaozi, and Shi Youcai, were captured. Two pistols and 17 bullets were seized. Deng and Chen were shot and seriously injured. At that time, a stray bullet injured a pedestrian, Liu Guoxun. They were sent to the hospital for treatment, as detailed in this newspaper. This morning, the police station sent Wang San and the other four people to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the previous situation and requested an extension of the temporary detention to investigate the case. The guns and bullets were presented for inspection. According to the report of the Chinese and Western detectives, Wang San confessed that he was invited by the injured Chen Zikui to rob the property of a certain family near the Yangshupu Water Plant. At that time, he met Chen on Yangzhou Road, together with the defendants Sun, Yang, and Shi, for a total of six people. Sun Dabao and Yang Dabao confessed that Deng Sanzi instructed them to go to a certain place, so they went together. Shi Youcai confessed that he happened to be going to a friend nearby to ask for money when he suddenly heard gunfire, so he fled and was mistakenly arrested. He did not know the other defendants and did not know anything about the robbery. Judge Wu Zehan ordered that they be remanded in custody and rescheduled to wait for Deng and Chen to recover from their injuries and be interrogated together.</p>

<h3 id="e275">Thoughts on the Great Earthquake in Japan <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>What a peculiar message! The Kanto region of Japan has had another major earthquake. I guess right! There must be many believing disciples of Guanyin Bodhisattva, so they put their hands together and say, "The net of heaven is vast, and it is not leaky. This is the consequence of murder and robbery!" Others are overjoyed, for the reason that Japan can be greatly injured as a result, and from now on, it may not be able to act recklessly and immediately hit Pingjin! Perhaps the military operation to attack Jehol will stop immediately. As for the gentlemen who are deeply aware of righteousness and work for the country and the people, we cannot accurately guess what they think, because "to measure the virtue of a gentleman with the heart of a villain" is very easy to "lose by a millimeter and deviate by a thousand miles," so it is best not to say it. But for the sake of "neighborly relations between Guo and Mu," perhaps the people of the whole country will be mobilized to save money and food to provide relief. Moreover, when our country had floods a few years ago, the Japanese Emperor "donated" tens of thousands of national funds. Therefore, based on the principle of "reciprocity," it is very dignified for us to reciprocate. Moreover, in the previous Kanto earthquake a few years ago, China also provided a lot of relief. This time, of course, there is no exception. Moreover, the current Sino-Japanese relations have indeed reached a point where it seems that they are about to break down. If we can move people with affection through this, although it may not immediately realize the Sino-Japanese alliance, at least we can avoid using troops, because Japanese imperialism may not have completely lost its conscience, and still will not stop military action.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own saying, everyone has their own reason, everything is logical, so the things in the world cannot be discussed in the usual way.</p>
<p>But in terms of the current form, the situation is indeed tense. Although the newspapers always use large headlines to prominently publish "Shorten the front line due to strategic relations" or "Deploy a new team line." The most clever title is "Entice the enemy to go deep," the name is very pleasant and very hopeful, so that everyone understands each other tacitly, in order to encourage the morale of the people, but to what extent has this morale been actually encouraged? The most obvious thing is that most of the glass windows of the shops are affixed with the four characters "Aviation to Save the Country," so those who really do not have spare money to donate to airplanes cannot avoid being filled with grief and indignation, because what they can take out is only hot blood and heads, but popular armament is actually difficult to do, so in addition to crying out to the heavens, all they can do is to ask the old man to bless them. Now the heavens are "responsive to requests," and Japan has had another earthquake. As for those who hope that Japan will stop its aggression because of the earthquake, so that they can have a rest and wait until "ten years of gathering strength, ten years of training" before comparing their strengths again, we can very well slap them on the buttocks!</p>
<p>However, to put it seriously, Japan's earthquake has nothing to do with us. The continuation of Japanese imperialism's aggression is the continuation of our anti-imperialist war. The broad masses of the people unite and fight to the end with the robbers on the anti-imperialist standpoint.</p>
<p>Correction In the previous article "Why Didn't Matsuoka Commit Suicide," the phrase "only self-help" at the end was mistakenly written as "only suicide." We hereby correct it.</p>

<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Xiaoshi has been living in seclusion since the Revolution of 1911, residing in Shanghai, entertaining himself with poetry and wine. Although he is seventy-seven years old, he is still full of energy. Yesterday, I saw his recent inscription on Zhang Dingcheng's old friend's three seven-character quatrains on receiving an award in Nepal, which described events of fifty years ago. I could not help but feel the vicissitudes of life, so I especially transcribed them as follows:</p>
<p>The stargate ship returns from ten thousand miles, I sang the sword ring in the sky, I worship the royal envoy again, I personally visit the Himalayas in the remote area.</p>

<p>(1) Fourteen Children</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's home is in a dirty alley. The house is a two-story Chinese style building. In that house, besides Mr. Wang's family, there's also the Zhang family upstairs in the living room, the Huang family in the garret, and the Xue family in the side room. A total of four families live in that small two-story house, and each family has two or three, or three or four children. So, when you go to Mr. Wang's home, the first thing you see is a lot of children. Sometimes they cry, sometimes they fight, making that small living room smoky and chaotic. There are fourteen of them in total, seven boys and seven girls. Strangely, the numbers of boys and girls are exactly half each. The origin of the fourteen children is as follows: the Zhang family upstairs in the living room has one boy and two girls; the Huang family in the garret has two boys and two girls; the Xue family in the side room has two boys and one girl; and Mr. Wang's family has two boys and two girls.</p>
<p>(2) A Half Stool</p>
<p>Mr. Wang occupies a side room upstairs in the house, about two zhang long and seven or eight chi wide. It's not big, but it's not small. Mr. Wang, his wife, and four children live there, which is manageable. However, Mr. Wang's family has very few stools. Counting them, there's only one and a half. What does this mean? It turns out that besides the stool Mr. Wang sits on to write, there's only a broken long bench. The long bench originally had four legs, but now only two legs remain. No one knows who broke it. This long bench has changed from four legs to two legs, so you can only say it's half a stool. Therefore, Mr. Wang's family only has one and a half stools.</p>
<p>(3) All-Encompassing</p>
<p>Although Mr. Wang's family has few stools, they have many other things: there are two beds in total, and two tables as well. Other items like a stove, kerosene lamp, oil bottle, teacups, teapot, etc., are too numerous to count. Therefore, Mr. Wang's room is truly all-encompassing. There are beds where they sleep, which can be called the bedroom; there's a cupboard for bowls and chopsticks, where they eat, which can be called the dining room; Mr. Wang sits on the only complete stool to write, read newspapers, and study, which can be called the study; they also cook there, which is the kitchen; in the summer, they also bathe there, which is the bathroom; behind one of the beds, there's a chamber pot, which is the toilet. Mr. Wang's one-room home includes a bedroom, dining room, study, kitchen, bathroom, and toilet, truly deserving the description of all-encompassing.</p>

<p>Midnight. The clock had struck one. My brother returned from a colleague's wedding, wearing two fresh and vibrant flowers.</p>
<p>"Is the bride pretty?" I asked, waking up and looking at him.</p>
<p>"Of course, the bride is a modern girl. She's a female teacher in her twenties. My colleague. Her wedding dress was rented from XX Company for 170 yuan!"</p>
<p>"I heard that the bride's dowry of 3,000 yuan was considered too little, and she refused to marry. They added another 1,000 yuan before she got into the sedan chair."</p>
<p>"Yes! She's been a primary school teacher for three years, with a head full of modern ideas. She's naturally read the philosophy of the 20th century thoroughly. Guess what kind of person her husband is?"</p>
<p>"A college graduate, a young man in a Western suit?"</p>
<p>"Your ideal philosophies are outdated! Who wouldn't think her husband is the young master of a soy sauce shop, an old-fashioned fellow in his thirties, with a face full of fat, thick eyebrows and big eyes, wearing a long gown, and with a full wallet."</p>
<p>"Oh! Why didn't she marry someone more handsome?"</p>
<p>"Ah, brother!" My brother took off his coat, somewhat excitedly, and said, "This is the true philosophy of the 20th century. It can be said that this lady's vision is not bad at all: what else is there to fear besides money?"</p>
<p>"Ah! Truly not bad! Only money won't fail!"</p>
<p>"Brother! Look at these two beautiful flowers I'm wearing!"</p>

<p>— Li Youzhang</p>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>Since I entered a certain store in this port in the year 18 of the Republic of China, I became acquainted with a colleague, Mr. So-and-so, and we became sworn brothers. In the year 20 of the Republic of China, I was promoted to teller. In the summer of the year 21, this sworn brother took leave to return to his hometown due to the passing of his father. At that time, he privately borrowed 25 silver dollars from me. Unexpectedly, before he returned to the store, I also suffered misfortune at home and had to return to my hometown. As usual, I handed over all the matters under my charge to another colleague designated by the manager. The matter of Mr. So-and-so's private borrowing was, of course, known to the manager, but he did not express any opinion. Two weeks later, my sworn brother returned to the store to work; I, due to various reasons, resigned and took another job. I recently received a letter from a former colleague informing me that Mr. So-and-so absconded with the funds last year; all the debts I handled have been ordered by the manager to be debited to my account; and a letter will be sent soon demanding repayment. I would like to ask whether I should acknowledge this debt; what harm acknowledging it would do to my reputation; and if I ignore it, can the manager guarantee to seek repayment from my guarantor? Furthermore, if this debt must be paid, can I entrust someone to transfer it? I eagerly await your reply. (The rest omitted)</p>
<p>Sincerely, Li Youzhang</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>Editor's note: Money is truly a terrible thing; unless you escape from the world, you can be completely disconnected from it; otherwise, you will inevitably have to deal with it; and once you handle it, if you don't do it well, you will have to bear considerable responsibility. At that time, responsibility lies where it belongs, and you can't help but reluctantly acknowledge it.</p>
<p>Mr. Li's case is an example. Because Mr. Li wanted to eat, and wanted to eat more comfortably, when the manager promoted him to teller, he was naturally willing to accept, and he would definitely be very happy. But after becoming a teller, the trouble came: when his sworn brother discussed privately borrowing these twenty-five dollars, how could he refuse? Some people say that Mr. Li should not have failed to inform the manager and made his own decision at that time: but we think these platitudes are wrong. Think about how hard-hearted capitalists are: if he had reported it to the manager, this matter would have been hopeless: with the close brotherhood of Mr. Li, how could he harden his heart? Later, Mr. Li's sworn brother actually absconded with the funds; in the eyes of most people, they will blame Mr. Li again, saying, "Your judgment is too poor, you are so close to this good-for-nothing person, now you are suffering losses, it is truly pitiful and not worth pitying." We think this is wrong again; before a bad person is discovered, it is really not easy to distinguish them; moreover, most people who abscond with funds are forced by circumstances; unless they are extremely desperate.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Who would be willing to do such a self-defeating thing? So, in our view, it is inevitable that Mr. Li feels unwilling to compensate for this money. But alas, this world is still under the monopoly of capitalism, and the law is also helping the capitalists; no matter how unwilling you are, you cannot escape responsibility. Even if you don't compensate, your guarantor will have to bear joint liability. As for the matter of whether acknowledging this debt will harm your reputation, this is not a problem; when you took leave to return to your hometown, the manager knew about this private borrowing, and his lack of objection was his acknowledgment that this money was indeed borrowed by your sworn brother. Now that you reluctantly compensate, it will not only not harm your reputation, but it will also show that you can take responsibility. Speaking of the method of delivery, it is of course best to deliver it in person, otherwise, entrusting someone to transfer it is also acceptable, but be careful not to entrust the wrong person again.</p>

<p>— Written by EoFalkowski, translated by Zhixiang</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>From the buildings on Jading and Ak Street, the workers who were sweating and whose lives were dictated by the mine whistles looked out. Every morning, the whistle drove them into the mysterious coal pits, and they didn't escape until evening. Their faces were covered in mud, and they wore foul-smelling clothes, suggesting the horrors of their lives in the coal pits, a place where ordinary people with leisurely lives could not imagine or stay long.</p>
<p>Miners couldn't imagine the joy of city dwellers. When the mine whistle blew, it easily revealed the differences in people's lives in society: one group of people, even though the whistle blew at six in the morning, could not be commanded by it and could still sleep soundly; another group of people, at this time, had to obey the whistle's command and run to the terrifying coal pit to struggle for bread.</p>
<p>This city was safely embraced in a mountain valley, undisturbed by the outside world. Many cities far away from here, such as New York and Boston, often had struggles over economics, but this small town embraced in the valley was very peaceful; only the smoke from the chimneys curled leisurely in the autumn dusk.</p>
<p>This city, like the smile of a sleepwalker, had passed year after year, with countless coal cars being transported to the market to compete with other fuels. Because of the recent strike, however, the sales of soft coal and kerosene exceeded those of hard coal, which had always been popular. It had occupied a superior position in the market in the past, but now it could no longer maintain it. The large advertisements in the newspapers confused the general public's eyes when buying fuel. At this time, the stoves seemed to show a cold and mocking look towards hard coal. Soft coal, whose sales had not been able to match hard coal in the past, was now greatly active in the basements that had previously only been the domain of expensive hard coal.</p>
<p>In the miners' union, based on the slogan of "cooperation and effectiveness," sympathy should have been shown to the workers on strike in the hard coal mines. Within the same union, the union leaders divided the common interests between the hard coal workers and the soft coal workers, drawing a line of demarcation. When the hard coal workers went on strike, the soft coal workers should have worked doubly hard to supply the fuel needs of society. Similarly, when the soft coal workers demanded better treatment and went on strike, the hard coal workers felt indifferent, and besides donating a small amount of money, they still worked as usual and happily worked hard to meet the urgent need for fuel. The union cleverly exploited this mutual indifference. Each practiced its own secrets, and this phenomenon continued.</p>
