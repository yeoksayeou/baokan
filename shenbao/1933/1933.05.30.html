<p>在中國民族運動史上占有重要地位之五卅事件。今日已届第八週年之紀念期矣。回憶民國十四年之五月三十日。由上海南京路上千餘羣衆與數十巡捕之衝突。演成死傷二十餘人之慘劇。因是引起全上海之大罷業。更進而漢潯粤渝寗慘案繼作。全中國人民協力奮鬭完成轟轟烈烈之一次民族運動。其影響所及。内則造成全國民衆聯合革命之基礎。外則使則强對中國民族之醒覺。有相當之認識。雖其後交涉未完全勝利。然事件經過之歷史。已足爲中國民族展開前途之希望矣。</p>
<p>五卅事件。不僅爲關係二十餘人死傷之事件。不僅爲對付直接負責之人或某一國家之事件。更不僅爲以事件發生前四閱月工潮爲起點之間單事件。實中國民族謀獨立求生存之一大運動。其原因爲數十年來中國對外屈辱。與各國積極侵略中國之歷史。基本體爲四萬萬中國人民接受世界民族運動之潮流。並因此而發洩之民族意志。其结果。至八年後之今日可謂尚未得到。故吾人紀念事件。不應以一時之流血慘劇爲重心。而應置重於當時造成此流血慘劇之背景。不應僅以對五卅殉難烈士之憑弔追懷爲範圍。而應一念今日中國民族之獨立與生存。已受到如何之威脅。</p>
<p>吾人生對日反抗。已至由軍民之艱苦奮鬭。至當局之商量停戰之今日。紀念此要求民族獨立與生存之事件。誠不勝其悲憤成概。雖然。日本之軍事能力。足以暫時佔據我四省以上之土地。足以毁壞我苦干無保護之村鎭。足以慘殺我抵抗能力未充足之多數軍民。足以壓迫我作前線停戰之談判。而决不能斬截我全民族繼續奮鬭之意志。使此後我民族能不陷於頽廢。能發憤圖强。繼續發場我民族意志。正自有日。八年前之五卅事件。已開我民族奮鬭之端。此後循途進行。以求民族獨立與生存之免除威脅。光明在前。國人其邁進焉。</p>
<p>中國民族運動。自辛亥革命以至五卅事件。實際參加奮鬭者之人數日多組織與能力。亦日益擴大。五卅事件中。目標所指之國家。雖未表示屈服。實已見機讓步。他日中國之民族運動。倘能繼續猛進。結合全民族之實力。嚴密組織。則最後之結果。必足以使凡侵害我獨立威脅我生存者。受其應得之敎訓。事在國人之努力爲之。</p>

<p>哈瓦斯二十九日但澤電　國社黨旣在但澤得勢、其行動得與柏林時相關聯、故但澤與波蘭之未來關係、已成爲一種問題、苦干人士追述希特勒曾作和平宣言、波蘭政府亦嘗保證維持秩序、加以國社黨首領冦赫林均允離開但澤、以避免發生示威運動、未始非緩和之象、波蘭人士對於國權黨之失敗、尙屬樂觀、因國權黨於競選運動時、不斷反對波蘭故也、自一九三○年以來、但澤參議院所行政策反到波蘭、不無滋生紛擾之虞、現國社黨勝利、則此種反波蘭政策亦即可以停止矣、國社黨方面深知與波蘭合作實爲必要、其所發表之黨網、絕示列入任何攻擊華沙之文字、此層已使但澤大多數居民爲之安心、</p>

<h3>廣西墾殖水利試辦區參觀記</h3>
<p>廣西通訊、最近復興農村之呼聲、甚囂應上、政府且有農村復興委員會之設、可見國人對於此事重視之一斑、顧復興之道如何、卽從何處入手、則論者主張不一、大部份人均主張從救濟人手、卽改良農作、低利貸欵、開發水利、普及鄉村敎育等等、最近農村復興委員會决議項目、即揭藥是義、山東鄒平縣之山東鄉村建設研究院其所標榜者、如振興農業、改進鄉村、亦不外乎是、是救濟鄉村建設鄒村、在今日已爲國内大部份人所公認爲復興農村之唯一辦法、無論其將來之功效如何、在今日吾人要不能不認其爲一種有力量之理論、則凡有根據此穩理論而見諸實施之農村事業、吾人自有加以注意與研究之必要、記者旅居廣西、聞廣西之柳州農柳城間、有廣西墾殖水利試辦區之設、以其爲廣西省不可多得之農村事業、特往參觀、茲將參觀所得、約略記述、報告國人、以爲今日留心農村問題者作一參考、</p>
<h3>（一）廣西墾殖水利試辦區概觀</h3>
<p>該試　區地點在廣西中部之柳州與柳城沙浦東泉石洞間、廣袤約二千方里、南北目柳州至沙浦之北、長百餘里、東西自柳城至東泉與石洞之東、闊九十里、全區面積作菱形、總區在沙塘、南距柳州縣城三十五城、有汽車可以直達、區主任爲伍廷颺、卽前廣西建設　長、區經費則由廣西省政府每年撥毫洋十萬元、（約折合滬幣七萬元）充之、全區人、合計約七萬五千餘人、分佈一百五十六村、其中由湖南方面轉徒而來者、佔面分之四十、由廣東及梧州等處來者、佔百分之三十、餘則爲撞人、爲柳州桂林一帶之土著、與猺人相類、是處同爲沈鴻英所蟠據、陸榮廷亦曾居是間、因連年戰亂、土匪極多、地方經濟、甚　枯竭、人口亦疎密不等、全區除東泉附近人烟較爲稠密外、餘皆荒地千里、人口極稀、附簡單地圖如下、</p>
<h3>（二）開辦經過</h3>
<p>該區最初本爲柳江林墾署之一部分、但開辦後經五六年、因種種原因、毫無發展、二十一年三月間、乃改爲廣西墾殖水利試辦區、獨立經營、故該區開辦迄今、尙僅一年、但因規劉周密　辦理努力、一年以來、成績已頗有可觀、記者在柳州時、曾遇一由美國哈佛大學派來中國研安昆蟲之列淦芝君、據云、在中國遍歷南北、爲時几二年有餘、所至鄉村無數、其間所見之鄉村事業、惟四川之巴縣北碚與該區、頗有足觀、其推重　此、</p>
<h3>（三）區政方針</h3>
<p>該區辦理方針、一言以蔽之、即爲改造舊農村、建設新農村、顧如何而後可以建設新農村、該區因環境關係、第一步僅先從增加生產着手、逮農民有相當經濟力、然後再進而要求農民自治、該區認爲第一應使農民人人有飯吃、此爲不易之原則、農民人人有飯吃後、第二步即應請求如何使農民吃得更好、更安樂、同時、又認爲飯是要大家有得吃、不應少數人有得吃而多數人則没得吃、更不應當勞心者可以吃得好、吃得安樂而勞力者就該吃得壞、吃得不安樂、故其一貫主張實在於、耕者有其田、」實現平等社會消滅貧富階級、其所以用墾殖水利試辦區之名獲、本與宗旨不符、不過爲避免社會誤會起見、乃用此名、其實該區主旨、並不僅僅以墾殖爲止也、</p>
<h3>（四）經營步驟</h3>
<p>該區經營步驟、分兩個時期進行、第一期着手改善鄉村經濟組織、並實施墾殖政策、第二期除繼續上期事業外、並着手各種社會設施與政治設施、茲分述於下、</p>
<p>（甲）經濟組織之改善　此爲進人農村之第一步、更分三種事業進行、</p>
<p>（一）設立借貸處　借貸處之性質、卽等於信用合作社、但其内容、視普通所見之信用合作社爲尤完善、第一、放欵由借貸處、接貸借於農民中間不假手於村長或區長、第二、担保品不注重於實質財產、如田地房屋等、而注重在農民平日之信用與勸勞之程度、第三、貸放之欵、係由該區向廣西銀行轉借而來、廣西銀行取息一分、該區轉貸與農民、亦取息一分、並不加收手續等費、全屬義務、故該借貸處頗能眞實爲農民服務、與普通合作社不同、記者曾問該處主持人、曷不逕用信用合作社之名稱、答云、本處現在所辦事業自否眞能合乎信用合作社之精神、尙未敢自必、若至相當時期、非定確實名稱不可時、吾等可在門口掛起一牌、題曰廣西柳城縣天字第一號沙塘信用合作社」、庶名副其實、其言雖滑稽、但亦屬慨乎言之、因與相視而笑、</p>
<p>（二）試辦倉庫　農民最感痛苦者、厥爲鄉村間地主之高利貸、此在各國皆然、廣西柳州農村利率有高至年利三倍於本金者、若農民平時無相當菩積、一届靑黄不接之際、每不惜飲酖止渴、甘受高利貸之壓迫而不拒、迨至新穀登場、則又有米商操縱壟斷、故意抑貶市價、合農民以重價生產之穀物、不得不以低價脫售、更加内地關卡重疊、交換不能流暢、荒年不能購人他處之穀以資救濟、豐年則又不能以餘穀出糶於他處歉收之地、致米價跌落、釀成穀賤傷農之現象、總之、無論荒年豐年、農民皆袛有瀕於破產之一途、如此輾轉數年、一般農民無不血肉皆盡、即小康之自耕農、亦無不日趨凋落、此爲今日我國一般之狀况、廣西自不在例外、該區有鑒於此、特創辦倉庫一種、爲農民儲糧之所、豐年收農民餘穀、儲之倉庫、以維持市價、荒年則散之以資救濟、靑黄不接之際、又可以儲穀接濟、其性質與普通積穀倉不同、而實　於上海地方之堆棧、其唯一目的、在存儲農民餘穀、調節民食、雜持米價、此項倉庫與貸欵處有密切連繫、法至良意至美、</p>
<p>（三）創設公店　此種公店頗類乎消費合作社購買合作社等、但與通常消費合作社又不同、其辦貨以需要而定、何時需要何種物品、始向他處躉批購買、與外埠商有相互連絡、並經營連銷合作事業、</p>
<p>上述三種事　、該區起手先辦第一種、俟第一種辦理有相當成效、然後接續辦理第二三種、該區以爲辦理鄉村事業第一步應使經濟有辦法、使農民對該區發生信仰、然後農民始能有團結、始可領事、而此三種事業、正爲深入農村與農民發生密切關係之人手辦法、必有須此三種事業辦理完善、然後始可進一步辦理其他事業、</p>
<p>（乙）實施墾殖政策　此爲進一步的建設新農村的計劃、該區荒地共分三種、一、水田、二、高地、三、山地、墾殖方法、亦分作三項同時並進、茲分述於下、</p>
<p>（一）中心農塲　　此係劃出小部分田地　作試騐之用、佔全區中之三百畝、此外及菓樹圍藝塲等、此種試騐區最初亦可由墾民自由耕植、但在墾民耕植區之旁、必有一區用科事方法耕植之田、以示比較、引起農民改良農作之信心、</p>
<p>（二）經濟農塲　此爲大規模墾植農塲、每區佔田萬畝以上用機器耕種、</p>
<p>（三）協作農塲　此由私人集股開墾、而受該區之指導、</p>
<p>該區規定上述田地、由墾民墾熟後、即將田地分給墾民、農具牲畜、則折價借給墾民、而由墾民分十年將折定之價攤還出資者、森林林木二分之一給與墾民、二分之一給與出資者、林地則完全由墾民所得、新村實施、至此可告一段落、</p>
<p>以上爲第一期着手工作、第一期工作完竣、然後進而從　社會之設施、</p>
<p>（内）實騐學校　此卽爲第二期工作、預定在二年以後開辦、其目的在以學校爲社會設施及政治設施出發點、訓練一般鄉村兒童、提高一般農民知識程度、進而謀農民之獨立與自治、</p>

<h3>往那裏走是生路</h3>
<p>丨松江汪斌君來信丨</p>
<p>我今年念多歲了。實在無路可走的時候。特地寫一信來述述我的身事。因爲在孩童的時代。未曾受過相當的敎育的苦痛。而且我不到十多歳不幸你母就相繼亡掉了。那時候我跟了我的胞兄度日。到了十五歳。承一位我父親在日的知友。介我到工廠裏去做學徒。過了三年。廠長開我每月四元的薪水。到今年第九年了。前在小孩的時候。都可以不知不覺的過去。現在是無路可走了。爲什麽呢。卽是二年前我是胞兄以爲我年已弱冠。應當成立家庭。那時我也不知什麽家庭負責的重担。就領命了。誰知道到現在剛三年。已經負債纍纍了。而且去年又添了一個小孩子。現在的開支加大了。我妻在未生產以前。還可以做工帮助一點。現在是不能了。我的胞兄也有家庭的負担。親友處告貸已盡了。要想去覓一處位置高些薪水大一點的職業。自問在上面已經說過。不曾受過相當的敎育。程度是全無的。就是人家要僱用職員。總是要用相當程度的。而且現在社會恐慌。失業人很多。有程度的文憑的人也很多。誰人肯用我呢。要想在本來這廠裏出息來應付家庭的開支。可不能了。因爲現在的生意衰落得不堪。東家以减省爲宗旨。我每　的薪水只八元。敢問現在我一家數口。何樣的度日。要去向東家求加薪水。他立卽開除。我就是要失　了。要去做工。又無人介紹。到鄉下去種田。又無田地。要自殺。又不能。這幾種思想之下。實在是無路可走了。只有懇求見識度和好生之德的記者先生爲我想一個圓滿的生路答復呀！</p>
<p>答··我們的讀者因爲生活没有出路而發爲問題的，差不多要占大半數。這就可見現在的社會之普遍的經濟破產，不但是鄉村而且是城市。我們於此實在難以替每個人想出生活的方法，因爲這是整個的社會問題，希望我們的親愛的讀者關於這種問題，千萬不要眼光只注在一身一家，奮鬭的目的，也不要只限於一身一家的利害。足下的問題，也是一樣，希望你從大處着想，爲羣而奮鬭，生路自然就有。更正昨日本欄第四十一行「或少數人的利益出發？」下脫「抑或由大多數羣衆的社會利益出發？」一句；第五十三行「或是普」三字下脫一「遍」字··第八十六行「與其說」三字係衍文··倒數第二行「聖的經」的「的」字衍文，合併更正，通訊手續··（一）開明姓·名·年齡·性别·籍貫·職業·詳細住赴。（二）附足回信郵票，（三）貼用本欄上角通訊印花。來函叙述事實，須簡單明瞭，字跡須淸楚。凡不附足回信郵票，不開明詳細住址，除可旋本欄發表外，概不作覆。</p>

<h3>打破時局之謎</h3>
<p>— 贍廬</p>
<p>時局之謎不容易打破麽？容易容易。</p>
<p>時局之謎用什麽方式來打破？用兩種方式來打破，一是捲簾格，一是繫鈴而兼紅豆格。</p>
<p>愛猜謎的人們，一定理會得猜謎的方式。有捲簾格，把謎語用倒讀法。有繫鈴格，把謎語加上一個　聲。有紅豆格。把謎語一句點成兩句。任憑什麽否定的話，用了捲簾格也會變做懐疑未定。用了繫鈴而兼紅豆格，便會由否定而成爲肯定。用着這般方式來猜時局之謎，大概總可以揭去這一紙謎條兒吧。</p>
<p>譬如外交家口中定的「决不屈辱，」這是一個時局之謎。第一步，用捲簾繫鈴格來猜，　是「辱屈不决；」可見外交家對於辱屈兩字，兀自不能解决。第二步，用繫鈴而兼紅豆格來猜，不字繫鈴，更成爲否字：又用紅豆格把一句分成兩句，其式如：「辱屈否？决。」「辱屈否？」是問話；「决」字是答語，便是决計屈辱的意思；那麽由否定而成爲肯定了。</p>
<p>再來　兩個時局之謎的猜法：譬如，將士口中的「决不退讓，」用着捲簾格、便是「讓退不决。」用着繫鈴而兼紅豆格，便是「讓退否？决。」又如，要人口中的「决不　和，」用着捲簾格，便是「和議不决。」用着繫鈴而兼紅豆格，便是「和議否？决。」</p>
<p>這是多麽傷心啊！辱屈否？决。讓退否？决。和議否？决。唉！如是云云的時局之謎。</p>
<h3>農村破產</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>農村破產了，農夫都丢了鋤頭鐵鏟望都市裏溜，都市裏的人，除了外國來的賑麥之外，赌都要没有飯吃了，那怎麽辦。</p>
<p>農村破產，實在也並不是時髦的一回事，我記得當我那條結着紅絨繩的小豚尾兒尙未剪掉的年頭兒，已有一大夥，一大夥的逃荒者，從江北不遠千里而到江南來。這不是農村破產在二三十年前，已風行一時的鐵證麽？這種逃荒者，一直到現在，還是每年有幾大夥光臨我的故鄉·同二十年前·没有變甚花樣兒，而我們還是每天三餐白米飯。所以農村破產，儘破產，不用找急。</p>
<p>但是我們每天吃飽了三餐白米飯，假使有的是閒情逸，那麽，不妨研究研究農村破產問題，當着要。</p>
<p>我記得從前在鄉間觀光逃荒者，每一集團裏，往往有好幾位穿着灘皮袍子，絲絨馬褂，坐着轎兒的老爺嘴臉者，心中很是納罕。後來一打聽，這些都是大户，就是現代的所謂大地主。大户有的是吃不完的米，花不完的踐。農奴儘破產，也是破不到大户頭上的，但是農奴們說，若是大户不逃荒，大家便要吃大户，大户們拾不得拔一毛而利農奴，於是不得不坐了轎逃荒。</p>
<p>在自下，大家打着救濟村的口號，但不知諸位委員老爺們，將何從着手起。農民是没有組織的，要救濟，總又不免要與有紳董資格的坐轎子的逃荒者接頭啦。得囉，這麽辦，坐二人轎的，怕不可大大的沾上些兒油水，換坐四人轎，農村破產，那纔破定啦。</p>
<p>到那時，我們的三餐白米飯，恐也不得不代以賑麥了。</p>
<h3>葬禮</h3>
<p>— 重樓</p>
<p>在都市中，我常常看見富麗堂皇的葬禮。</p>
<p>走在前面的有耀武揚威的馬隊，穿着紅綠制服的樂隊，掮着各種祭品步行隊，因吸食鴉片而致面黄肌夜的僧道隊，接連着又是樂隊步隊……，以及一切人，物，蜿蜒着丨前進着！</p>
<p>孝子（？）是走在靈柩的前面的，雖然他們說是··「苫塊昏迷，痛不欲生」。但他們却没有忘記派幾位鏢客隨身保護，以防因步行而發生意外的危險。</p>
<p>送葬的汽車接連在大隊後面迂緩的開行着，它們像是失去了疾馳的威權。不過你在這種種不調和的情况當中，却能聽見旁邊擁擠的觀衆們在嘻笑歡呼着說··「這是很好看的大出喪呀！」</p>
<p>人是已經死了，但人的骨骸還要被拿來做一次葬禮的工具！有人說··「死人是常常要受活人的欺騙的，」我觀葬禮後而益信了。</p>
<h3>記靑島之海市蜃樓</h3>
<p>— 竹影</p>
<p>靑島前海，距岸五十里之山石起伏間，或名之日舞鶴濱地方者，於五月二十二日，午刻十一句半鐘，忽現奇景，樓台亭閣，高過山巔，所謂海市蜃樓者是也。樓如二坐大規模之工廠，窗門洞闢，人影往來，在此霎那之間，雖鬼斧神工，不能有如此速者，今忽映眼簾矣。</p>
<p>時吾友曲君益三，散步海濱細沙之上，覩此奇景，躍然一驚，認爲生平未之見，即欲以電話召余，同賞此千百年不見之奇觀，顧該處又無電話，因派同遊者某君，來寓送信，余午睡未醒，突聞此信，即怱怱往，至則見此大海中之蜃樓，已漸消化，離水平線僅有丈許耳。</p>
<p>樓作淡赭色，與山石無異，平呈於水上，水上帆影往來，不辦眞幻，當時海濱遊人，有特雇漁船前往覘異者，至其處遂没，懊喪而返。樓後一帶城垣，前則樹木　立，恍如北平前門之光景，左有小亭一座，亭下白雲高湧，又如一幀古盡，忽懸海天深處，無怪觀者稱奇矣。</p>
<p>自此海市蜃樓出現之消息傳出後，中山路上，爭往參觀者，途爲之塞，莫不爭先恐後，或乘人力車，或駕摩托車，或乘脚踏車、車馬往來，横衝直撞，不顧一切，惟恐失之交臂也。</p>
<p>於是一船迷信家，謠言紛起，有謂靑島將如何如何者，有謂大局將如何如何者，一般居民，驚喜文集，莫衷一是。又有謂係蜃　張穀，藉陽光曙晒，因將岸上之樓台風物，倒映穀中，由穀中，反映於岸上。或謂苟能出其腹中珠璣，置爲燈燭，至夜間以火燃之，則見期燭光中之樓台浮動，如在海中出現者無異，語雖無稽，亦堪慰未曾目覩者之渴望耳。</p>
<p>海濱一帶，人山人海，萬頭攢動，南海石椚杵左右，觀者如堵，無插足地，莫不爭看此百年不遇之奇景，惟好景不長，一轉瞬間，（歷一小時許）已不復見。致使後來者徒呼負負，未得覩此奇景，咸盼明日此時，重現海上，得以飽覽，惟不能盡如人意耳。</p>
<p>按海市蜃樓，完全爲空氣作用，以溫度低於空氣，幾經曲折，映成宫殿城市之光景，若隱若現，反射人目，以春夏之交，風平浪靜時，多有此現象也。</p>
<p>來函　昨讀貴報鄭君逸梅所紀盧子嘉軼事一則，未免大相徑庭，想必傳聞之誤。不佞居盧幕久，江浙之戰，是非姑不必追論，不過盧氏始終不主戰，曾兩次密囑不佞來滬，請唐少川先生設法從旁消彌，少川先生今猶健在，可以質問也。至有無向夏超過餉及摑頰事，今未十年，浙中士紳當能追憶，固不必不佞曉曉代辯。查盧氏之父，於庚子拳匪亂時卽告失踪，昨某小報所記雖多不符，惟失蹤則確屬事實，其母則早已物故在前，迄江浙之戰，更何來母氏，若盧氏之向無珠玉古玩，御下亦從無疾言厲色，此凡與盧氏有一日之雅者，都能言之，至此侍從之述，不知何所見而云然也，尙祈察閱被露爲幸。　　了盦謹狀</p>

<p>自人造絲侵銷以來，中國綢業，一落千文，良以價値懸殊，買主貪廉，商人重利，只此八字，已成不可救藥之死症。去年一二八後，予在機聯會刋中，曾有數篇文字，略抒我見，希望天然絲價能與人造絲抗衡。不意此次杭州國貨展覧會中，所售眞絲大綢，竟比人造絲者爲廉，每四僅十四元，長四丈六尺，闊二尺四寸，祇核每尺三角之譜，而人造絲職者，最低價亦需每尺三角四分，因各剪一條，試以火柴燃之，眞絲者但覺焦蜷膨脹，如鴉片膏狀，並不成灰，而人造絲者，則與布條無異，立化飛灰，另以人造絲與天然絲交織者燃之，則亦眞僞顯然，莫可隱遁，因念此等試騐方法，實至簡單，人人皆能立試，亦爲人人所能辦識，吾杭有此美廉出品，各地豈有不能，洵能如是，不但可以戰退人造絲，並且可以戰退洋紗，因用細秒所織之布，名爲國產，實係外棉所紡，五萬萬入超之中，不過爲棉與米麥三項，假令人人屏絕細布而用大綢，卽靈絲無過剩之虞，毋庸求售於外。此等大綢，論其工本，卽售三角一尺，亦不過爲薄利多賣之策，並不致於虧蝕，每疋平均重量，不過不一磅七五，以六百四十元一担之絲價核之，所用原料，不過八元四角，織工以每尺一角論，不過四元六角，卽在販賣者所得之利，亦已超過五釐常度，不得謂之過薄，而在用户方面，可謂便宜之至。蓋洋布之價，每尺尙需二角有奇，與其購用洋布，何若用此大綢，若必用布，則當購用土布，庶免利權外溢，但使人人抱定此旨，卽在人造絲與美棉兩項，可得解决，農村之復興，可以翹足而竢，實跂望之。</p>
<h3>俱樂部</h3>
<p>— 周才良</p>
<p>說起俱樂部，誰也都知道它是消遣娛樂的塲所，考查這名詞的來源，確是頂括括的道地東洋貨，起先惟我國通商大埠有之，而具團體分子也以服務洋商的華人爲多數，每値休假，團員們都如約而至，舉凡絲竹書報琴棋（茶更不必說）等高尚娛樂設備，幾乎應有盡有，所謂各投所好，儘量消遣，陶情樂性，眞很得調劑工作疲乏精神的益處，繼後風氣日開，仿行漸衆，組織分子旣良莠不齊，因而賭博的娛樂品像「雀牌」等類，也慢慢地盛行起來，等到日久成習，遂寖漸而僭居爲俱樂部的主要工具，而且因爲俱樂部的組織，是向屬正當團體，好像官廳方面也默許它享着保障賭博安全的特利，利之所在，誰都要歆羨而仿效，遠的人的地方固不必說，姑就僻處海隅的我鄉（張溪）來說，一個小小的鎭上，住户不滿千家，那供給消遣的茶坊，酒　，却有四五十家之多，（烟尙不在内）其間尤以變相賭窟的俱樂部游客爲最盛，當此農忙時節，在這裏還是呼盧喝雉的旦夕不休，上至士紳階級，下及販夫走卒，無論識與不識，差不多沆瀣一氣的都表示着樂此不疲，照例大約市面多少可以繁盛些，農民生活也必寛裕異常，那知事實况適得其反，據說此間自從去秋鹽收迄今，因爲穀賤傷農的緣故，以致調劑平民經濟的當舖營業，竟是一落千丈（當多贖少，）其他各項生意的不景氣，也可想而知，那末像各地俱樂部（以我鄉爲比例）的生意獨佔興旺，其實正在急促整個農村經濟的崩潰。唉！再也想不到我國革命興學數十年，它的結果，却造　成了今日各地麻雀敎育之普及，民性旣好樂如此，國事又安得不陷入「不亦樂乎」之境地乎？嗚呼噫嘻，吾列何言！</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第八回　憤語激靑年辭官遁去</p>
<p>熱心憐少女挾壙親來</p>
<p>趙自强在酒酣耳熱之際，忽然轉着話鋒，提到了前院的楊老太太，關耀武覺得他這個提議不能是毫無意思的因之立刻就到前院來會江氏，在院子裏先呌了一聲拜年的來了，然後推着門走進屋去。江氏迎出來笑道··表哥來了，桂枝快沏茶。桂枝應聲走出來。他今天穿了一件簇新的花點子旗袍，照着旗族人家規矩，依然還拖了一條長辮。在額頭前面，他長長的留了一剪劉海髮，這很可以表示，他雖是二十以上的人，依然還保留着他的處女之美啦。因爲他臉上雖也和别個旗族姑娘一般塗抺着很濃厚的脂粉，但是他的皮膚，却較之普通人細膩得多，一笑起來，在紅嘴唇裏露出兩排白牙，這都不是其他二十歳以上的姑娘，所能有的美態。開耀武心裏，立刻就想着，有這樣好的姑娘，而且粗細事情都能做，我們把弟，還有什麽不想的，只是有了院鄰這一層關係，不好開口罷了。這話又說回來了，像表妹這樣的人才，至少也要嫁個趙自强一般的人，才對得住他。在關耀武這樣進門的一刹那之間，他望着桂枝的臉上，已是連連轉人好幾個念頭。桂枝看他如此注意，倒有些不好意思，不由得先人低了頭。提了茶壼斟着茶道··怎麽回事？表哥今天老望着我，我今天臉上還有一些什麽特别的地方嗎？關耀武笑道··我會看相，我看你臉上，鴻鸞星照命，喜信要動了。桂枝端了一杯茶，放到舊的茶几上，推到他的面前來。一面鼓了嘴道··大正月的挑好的說罷。關耀武索與偏了頭望着他道··鴻鸞星照命，這句話還壞嗎？你知道什麽呌鴻鸞星？（八五）</p>

<h3>再論「塡鴨」式的敎育</h3>
<p>— 天一</p>
<p>前兩天有人從塡鴨談到敎育，說現在的從事敎育者，大都在幹着塡鴨的工作，敎師們不願念學生們的食堂，也不顧念當前社會和時代的需要，只揑着一團所謂「學問」的食量，向學生們的肚裏塞，等到學生的肚了塞滿了，便算盡了唯一的職責了這比喻當然已經是刻薄極了，但，我以爲假如現在的敎師們底手裏眞的都揑有一團「學問」的食料，而且眞的能將學生的肚子和塡鴨一樣的塞滿，那究竟還不能不算是差强人意的事，可是事實上現在大多數的敎師手裏本就没曾揑有食料，其所以「誨人不倦」者，并不是爲了要塡滿學生的肚子，而只是爲了要塡滿自已的肚子。</p>
<p>假如我們不否認事實，就不能不承認今日的敎育家們上焉者爲扮演魔術，中焉者爲開留聲機，而下焉者則爲徒以學生爲衣食的工具。所謂扮演魔術者何？今日搬演東洋之制度，明日侈談歐美之主義，改土八股，不求其適合實際，更不求其有若何之效率，正如變戲法，演魔術者只以新奇自炫，巧妙自誇。所謂開留聲機者何？留聲機的發出聲音，只是一種被動的動作，只是機械式的呌，只是唱念刻版式的歌曲，許多敎師也正是這樣，只是爲敎而敎，毫無目的，敎育不能活潑地運用，而成爲一種死笨的「形式」，或粉飾耳目的工具。至於所謂以學生爲衣食工具者，事實尤其顯明，這裏我們用不着細說。敎育如此，所以敎育的成績只是爲社會養成高等游民，爲國家造出官僚政客。塡鴨式的敎育雖對於社會没有積極的益處，消極的害處，要亦較小，然而此種塡鴨式的敎育今日要亦不可多得呵！</p>
<h3>不准哭！</h3>
<p>— 馬國亮</p>
<p>也許有人從生到死，不曾享受過一點快樂，但是却没有人不曾感受過痛苦的，無論是直接從精神上，或是間接從物質上。</p>
<p>痛苦的種類很多，我們去似乎不能用客觀的一定的標準尺來衡量，說那一種痛苦比那一種深或淺，這是因人，因時，因地而異的。正如一個孩子喪失了他心愛的玩具，和一個富翁喪失了他的財富，這兩人所受到的痛苦，我們誰能說那一個是深一點呢！</p>
<p>但我們雖不能說出那一類痛苦最輕，我們却可以說出那一種痛苦最大。這便是··「有了痛苦而不許你伸訴出來」的痛苦。</p>
<p>孩子失了他的玩具而不許他哭泣，富翁失掉他的財富而不許他嘆氣。或向别人訴苦，世間還有比這個更爲深湛的苦痛麽？</p>
<p>日常我們遭遇了不幸的時候，我們定會找一個朋友，或是能夠同情於自已的親人，來訴說出自已鬱抑在心裏的苦惱；雖然這於事實是毫無補益，但是有機會傾吐了出來，心裏便舒服許多，這也是我們每一個人都有過的經騐。如果找不到可傾說的人，便獨自大哭一塲吧，或是在文字，圖書，或音樂種種方面來宣洩吧。這都是人們通常採用的宣洩痛苦的方法。廚川白村所謂藝術是苦惱的象徵，便是這個意思。</p>
<p>至於父親被人殺死，兒子歷盡艱辛，也要把仇人殺掉。其實明知殺掉仇人不能使已死的父親復活，無他，宣洩因父親被殺而蘊結着的痛苦而已。再從極普通的事來說，某人因爲憤怒之極而把自已家裏的一隻花瓶繫破，我們却不能笑他是傻子，唯有最聰明的人才能在痛苦到無可宣洩時想到擊破花瓶來減輕苦痛的方法。</p>
<p>由此可見，人們雖没有方法去抵抗痛苦之來，却知道在牠來了之後怎樣去驅除牠。倘若連驅除痛苦的權利也被剝奪，這不是最難堪的麽？曼殊斐兒在她的Ma　Parker　一篇中，說這個老媽子備嘗了人生的慘過，却连一個可以讓她痛快地大哭一塲的地方也没有，人生到此，眞要比死亡還更慘痛了呵！</p>
<p>最近讀到Oliver　Goldsmith的一篇Happiness　In　a　GreatMeasure　DependenOn　Constitutation（快樂多半是靠性質的）中，說到抵禦苦痛的方法時，他說「……第一個方法便是忘記了我們的苦惱，下一個方法便是把苦惱隱藏起來；和不幸爭鬭，在衝突時我們一定會受傷的。要得到勝利，其唯一的方法便是逃走。」</p>
<p>他所謂「逃走」，便是把痛苦忘記或隱藏起來。其實能不能忘記是不由人自主的，而隱藏也不過是自欺欺人，痛苦依然蘊積在心中，自已是依然在受苦，在想尋求宣洩驅除的方法的。</p>
<p>今晨從窗口看見我的一位隣人在鞭責一個年幼的婢女，當好小女孩因痛而大聲號哭時，嚴厲的主婦却來了一句··「不准哭！」我替那孩子設想，固然她是無法忘記所受的屈辱和肉體上的痛苦的。而「隱藏」於她自已也確毫無益處。果在她到底又哭出來了！可是隨了哭聲而來的又是一句··「不准哭！」的怒吼和鞭撻丨</p>
<p>這慘苦的人間！</p>
<h3>悔</h3>
<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>像鮫人離不開海一樣，我這生長自喝茶鄉的人總是到處找尋喝茶的地方。在南京，雨花台麓是我　常去喝茶的地方的一個。</p>
<p>有一次，在坐夠了，喝夠了的以後，我走出了茶舖，沿着曲折的小徑上升。到上面，見有一處一個人都没有，彷彿是一個被忘却的孤墳，獨自凄淸地站在那里。我的前進的方向便專注着那一面。正在上那斜坡，突然聽到後面有呌喊的聲音，那聲音紛擾了我那專注地走着的步趨。我聽不淸在呌什麽。可是因爲呌得那麽厲害，我不能不站定了脚旋回身去探究。旋回去，便看到對丘站着一個兵士，兩手平執着他的槍，作着要撥機扭的樣子，看來好像我的身體的或一部分就是他的將發的子彈的目標。</p>
<p>「你再走，我打死你！」那兵士怒吼着。</p>
<p>到這時我才驚異地看到那兵士的呌跳，確是對我而發。我便不解地對着我所想要前去的丘端的小屋望了一望。</p>
<p>「還要看！你要去做砲灰？」那兵士也不解似地警告而詰責。</p>
<p>「哦，原來那里有砲，去了便該做「砲灰」，我醒悟了，便沉思地下着我所走上了的坡道。我還留心望着，想看一看我剛才所忽略了的道旁的「砲台重地，閒火止步」之類的牌示。可是没有。「要是我剛才没有回頭！」我又沉思；「要是我剛才没有回頭，不是，是許，我已到了人生的彼岸。一個與我現在的全然異趣的境界？」</p>
<p>不；我並不想自殺。只是那樣出於不自知地把生命戴然告一叚落，或者甚至受些小創　總覺得是比較有意思的事情，雖然要是眞的那樣了，也許有人會冷靜地說這是蠢物，竟連砲台那樣的險地也會不經心地走去。</p>
<p>是的，我在後悔那我的多事的頭的一回。</p>
<h3>蘧廬絮語</h3>
<p>— 子展</p>
<p>（三十七）可以休矣</p>
<p>一　昨（五月二十七日）上海某小報刋登「據說」短文一篇，作者自稱雲英女士。略謂「自由談上曾經聲明過公開投稿。……有十八世紀的臭腐先生子展公的遺作蘧廬絮語也登也上面，嗚呼子展，如此作品，可以休矣。」予方讀竟，亦不禁嗚呼曰，雲英女士！如此作品，予猶未肯休也。予之爲文，無甚意義，噉飯而已。以名山事業責之，則吾豈敢；以臭腐稱之，吾亦謙讓未遑。有人駡予低能，予敬謝曰，予固無能，低於何有？有人駡予不革命，予亦敬謝曰，革命何爲？予無同志。有人譏予落伍，予笑答曰，予已落陸矣。有人譏予老氣横秋，予亦笑曰，予已老氣横冬矣。又有人詆予頭腦冬烘，予曰，人而冬烘，不僅頭腦。今雲英女士謂予爲十八世紀人，實則予求爲無懷氏之民，葛天氏之民，而不可得也。甲談唯物史觀，謂爲萬應靈藥；乙談民生史觀，謂能百病消除；予談喫飯史觀，不過家常便飯。予之敎書，非以大學敎授爲名高也，騙飯喫而已。予之作文，非以著作家自命也，騙飯喫而已。予固不願自知生于何代，秦歟？漢歟？將近代歟？任人位置可也。</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— Jules　Renaro作　林取譯</p>
<p>像布魯脫斯一樣（續）</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨怎麽？你那樣高談闊論，潢臉通紅，揮着拳頭，差不多呌得全村人都聽到了你還說没有說什麽！把那句話再說一遍看看，好使大家傾敎領敎。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚亅這用不着再說的，算了罷，媽媽。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨說，說，你剛才講着什麽人；你究竟講着誰？</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨這人是你不懂得的，媽媽。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨正因爲懂得才要你說啦。我請你先把頭腦弄淸楚一點，然後服我的話。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨好，我說能！媽媽，剛才我和爸爸閒談着，爸爸給了我一些好意的勸告，我爲着對於爸爸表示感謝起見，不知那來的念頭，竟在爸爸面前許了口，並引着那呌做布魯脫斯的羅馬人的話……</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨呸，你瞎扯。我請你用着同樣的聲調，一字不改地把你剛才說的那句話再說一遍。我覺得我所要求的並不是什麽了不得的事情，你實在很可以顧着你母親的意思做的。</p>
<p>菲利克斯丨我來替他再說一遍好嗎，媽媽？</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨不，等他先說了，你再說，然後我們來比較。說罷，紅蘿蔔鬚，快點。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚以一種要哭的聲音，吃吃地說着。</p>
<p>「操……守，你……不過是……一個……名詞……」</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨眞没有辦法。這東西是無論怎樣說都不行的。他是寗願讓人家痛打也不肯使得他母親高興的。</p>
<p>菲利克斯丨聽啦，媽媽，他是這樣說的呢··（他把兩眼轉來轉去，投出一種挑撥的眼光。）「萬一我的作文考不到第一名時，」（他鼓起兩頰，把脚在地上踏着。）「我可以像布魯脫斯一樣寫着··」（他把兩臂舉起。）「啊，操守！」（他把兩臂放下。）「你不過是一個名詞罷了！」他是這樣說的啦。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨好呀，學得像極了！我恭賀你，紅蘿蔔鬚，可是你固執着不肯重說，實在使我引爲憾事，因爲倣造究竟比不上原作啊。</p>
<p>菲利克斯丨但，紅蘿蔔鬚，這話究竟是不是布魯脫斯說的呢？這不是加能（Caton）說的嗎？</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨我相信這確是布魯脫斯說的。書上還說··「隨後他便投身在他朋友手中的寳劍上自刎了。」</p>
<p>愛勒絲丁丨紅蘿蔔鬚說的不錯。我還記得布魯脫斯曾裝作瘋癲，把黄金塞在手杖裏面呢。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨不紛，姐姐，你扯錯了。你把我所說的布魯脫斯混到另一個人身上去了。</p>
<p>愛勒絲丁丨但我相信不會錯的。我可以向你保證，蘇菲女士講授給我們的犘史决不會比你那公立中學敎員講的壞。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨這不相干。你們不要爭論。最要緊的是我們家裏要有一個布魯脫斯，而我們現在已經有了。虧得紅蘿蔔鬚的力量，我們可以使得人家羨慕起來！我們一有着這　的就榮耀還不知道呢。現在你們可以瞻仰瞻仰這新布魯脫斯啦。他像一位主敎一樣說着拉丁文，可是他拒絕給那些聾子作第二次的彌撒。你們把他翻過來，從正面一看，他今天才穿上身的新衣已經有着汚迹，再從背面一看，他的褲子已經撕破了。天啊，他究竟又竄到什麽地方去來？不，你們且看我把成了布魯脫斯的紅蘿蔔鬚打給你們看看！稚弱的野獸啊，滚罷！</p>

<h3>血</h3>
<p>— 牛</p>
<p>血，果眞是不祥之物，上海的血案，可算天天都有，而今天南京路上的特别大血案紀念，尤足見血是不祥的表證、列推開幾百步說，一二八的血宁，九一八的血案，以至近日平津的血案，四川劉鄧的血案，我國熱血男兒，不知擲了幾許頭顱，濃了幾許熱血，若一談起血，眞是不寒而憟。</p>
<p>血，本來是不祥之物，從歷史上看來，國家多事，將要興動干戈。往往有「天雨血」「河流赤」的變報發生，天先爲之警戒，尤其是近年以來，變象迭出，如去年龍門附近，黄河忽然收狹，河中翻起寳物及米糧等等，這種變報，天然不是好預兆，近據汕頭電，潮安綵虹遶日，歷半小時，朝江水變赤，沙泥沸起，濁如血，自竹稔山至急水塔城订附近，人家改食井水，歷二十時始滅，這不是一種血的變報麽，北方的血案未乾，南方的血兆又見，眞是不出血不罷休呢。</p>
<p>然而上海下級社會的人，往往以金錢爲血，譬如說「今天我本來要想請客，但是襄中没有血」，又如說「某人的血麥卡麥卡，可惜不肯拔一毛」，多以血來替代金錢，起初我不解，金錢是吉羊的，而又爲可寳可貴之物，血是最爲可怕可慘的東西，以金錢比血，似覺比非其倫。</p>
<p>仔細想來，其中很有至理，血的人身，本來是最寳貴的，人而無血，則其人心死，金錢亦爲人所最寳貴的東西，人無金錢，即不能生活，故可慘可怕的是血，而最寳貴的亦是血，可愛可寳的是金錢，而可怕可慘的亦是金錢，故以血比金錢眞是一　個恰而且巧。</p>
<p>馬路英雄，爲了幾只袁頭，拔出尖刀，造成血案，帝國主義者拿了飛機大砲，到處横行無忌，亦造成血案，故金錢即爲血的代價，而血亦即爲金錢的代價，金錢不當用而用，果然是浪費，當用而不用亦是「屈死」，血亦是如此，不當渍灑而灑，果然不興，當灑而不灑，亦豈是「屈活」。</p>
<p>倘若犧牲了血本，博得了金錢，原是兩不吃虧，若犧牲了血本，而不到金錢，眞是犧牲血本大拍賣了，而在顧在主方，得了物貨，又不出金錢，此種便宜眞到那裏去搭呢，故出血而不取代價眞是「屈死」，不出血而得到代價，惟有「强盜」。</p>
<h3>難爲了「上帝」！</h3>
<p>— 愛連</p>
<p>在人心慌惶的一城市中，消息傅來，曰兵逼近城下了，那縱横的慘苦的以往的境像，在每個人心中戰顫着事實，勢將發現了更有什麽能再慰安自心呢！「唔！禱告，還是祝禱上帝求以授助吧，於是合家大小跑到在聖母像前，那尊長者開始作着禱告了··「天上的爺！我們感謝着你賜與我們的衣食住；我們的靈魂能復活，我們的罪惡能靠了你的寳血洗淨，可是現在我們虔誠的跽求着天上的爺能賜予我們和平，安全，日兵是逼臨了城下，那悲苦的慘劇勢將開始了，雖然罪惡的人類是應當受一番折磨，不過上帝啊！願你恕了他們七十個七次，像聖經上說過的一般求上帝賦以和平，安全，使罪惡的人們的個自新的機會，同是用你博愛的精神去感化敵人的暴行，使得我們城中的人民平安的生活着，仰望天上的爺接受我們虔誠的祝禱阿。」</p>
<p>在燈火輝煌的一個城市中，消息傳來，中國兵節節安全退出，不久的將來勢將有滿意的實望了，在每個人臉上充滿了驕傲怏樂的現象，在籌備慶祝大會的籌備會中，主席發言的說；讓我們祈求上帝吧，由上帝的賜予我們勇士的助力，使得我們的慶祝祝即日的開演起來，同志們丨容我們禱告吧，於是許多人就跪下，禱告開始了··</p>
<p>「天上的爺！我們感謝你給與我們的勇氣，使我們的民族有了光榮的歷史，使我們的國土擴大到中國的東三省，這裏我們所要祈求的是，願上帝賜我們的勇士有列大的勇力，很迅速的踐平季中國的東三省，完成了我們的願望，們，」</p>
<p>上帝在冥冥之中，同時接到了二個禱告，上帝似乎太爲難了去答覆，這兩個祝禱，一急之下，智從中來，於是用安撫的口吻對第一個祝告的人說··</p>
<p>「這裏我允許你們的祝告賜於你們的和平，安全，但是你們要記得「愛你的仇敵」那句話，你們應當開了城門去愛護你們的仇敵，這就是我賜你們的平安，」</p>
<p>上帝翻轉身來回答第二個禱告是··</p>
<p>「記住吧那句「愛你的仇敵一的話，當你仇敵開城來愛護你的時候，你也應當愛護他們，」</p>
<p>難爲了上帝想出兩全的美法解决了一切的問題　萬　了　帝萬歲</p>

<h3>雜詠</h3>
<p>報載吳佩孚居平，不談國事；只是吟詩，其詠時事一絕，悲憤之意，溢於言表；其風格不减當年之「大水詩」，爰步元韵，率成二絕。　　西河主人</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>原燎何妨隔岸觀，精誠豈必瀝胸肝，佇看五十餘年後，（節用胡博士語）鷄犬飛昇舐鉢丹。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>孚威氣燄忍回觀，富貴浮雲嘆鼠肝，往事已成蕉鹿夢，那堪冷灶復燒丹。</p>
<p>意有未盡復成一絕</p>
<p>前人</p>
<p>不談國事只吟詩，（用廿五日某報標題語）猶似將軍入泮時，寂寞故園空灑淚，何嘗重整洛陽師。</p>
<p>詩旣成無塵君更成</p>
<p>一絕仍用元韵</p>
<p>將軍底事祇旁觀，貫日空吟慰　肝，　恨至今輸一馬，燕昭難學學燕丹，</p>
<h3>上海的幾種典型人物素描</h3>
<p>— 具</p>
<p>（一）名流大亨</p>
<p>衣服着得那麽破舊，而面孔却大率肥得走油，這便是名流大亨的輸廊盡；粗粗看去，活像堂倌走卒。因此，有時不免遭宴會裏機關中的没眼睛的侍者的奚落·然而名流大亨是有岂過頂天修養的，「君子不較小量，」嘸啥關係，只消向瞎眼奚落的侍者作番說明，呌他下次不要小覷了衣着破舊的人就是了。這正格外顯出自已的「豁達大度」的豐采來，嚇得侍者鼠竄鼠竄的，碰幾個響頭，陪禮求恕。而一般旁觀者，便昨舌正色，讚聲喋喋。這輩名流大亨，在上海是有着超越的勢力，與華洋兩方的當局都拉得緊緊的，市上生了亂子，或說要興革什麽市政，小民的權利義務，便在他們的掌中旋翻，他們的汽車在街心是「呞」的疾駛，爲的是他們倒很少有閒工夫兜風·他們全是高等華人·上海舞台的大班。　　（二）西裝少年</p>
<p>在上海，提到西裝少年，眞像二三月裏水田中蝌蚪一樣的多，又像　三四月裏水田中靑蛙一樣的跳呌，這團集來得十足複雜，有公子哥兒，有公司職員·有公務員，大學生，拆白黨；但在靑一色（注意··並非他們全是着的靑色西裝）的西裝統蓋下，誰也辦不出他們的身份與職司，他們有的是閒情，有的是麥克麥克，成排的在街邊踱，旣有助於市肆的熱閙，也是大都會少不了的點綴。從游藝場轉向公園，或踏上崔巍的旋館之門，是他們每日的生活行程。但也有在書局的架攤前或路邊的揭報牌旁·孜孜然在　學問工夫的，只是很少數。閒踱時，釘眼過路的女人腿·好像是他們唯一的職司。在洋塲數十里的上海，確也少不了這羣角色。</p>
<p>（三）摩登小姐</p>
<p>物以「相承相生」見長，有了那麽一批西裝少年，也就需要一羣摩登小姐，陰陽配　，兩性婫美，於是就有那麽多的小姐，登在高跟的革履上，飛馬似的滿　　　　　　　　　更　　　　　之能事，有閨秀，有名媛，有舞女，有女學生，等而下之，有女流氓，有野鷄，有鹹肉莊。緊　在他們掌中的皮夾，是那麽的神秘，丨丨裏面滿裝着小方鏡，口紅，香水精，香粉，電影說明書，出堂票。他們的眼不打野，但也不討厭男子的釘梢。經過大公司時，才會稍停一歇，看有不有新的衣飾品出世。</p>
<p>（四）白相朋友</p>
<p>紮小開衣服，袖口反折半面，絲光襪，花緞鞋，那麽一根寬的綢褲帶，平掃及膝。三五個要好，聚集攏，不是說那一宗爛貨Ｘ風騷，便是說昨天的夜飯米是怎樣敲來的。有時從口袋裏掏出幾個銅板，大家朝對一個目標擲丢，那是一種最能消磨辰光的玩意兒，雖然勝負不大。等有陌生生的女人走過時，跟上前，一聲兩語的獻殷勤，女人窘得來呌巡捕。慕前嗚路，愚園路就時常有着這一套，巡捕臨了，早已哄然而散，逃之夭夭，有時他們會無故的向你的乾凈的衣上噴兩口濃痰，你若不服，他說你踩髒了他的花緞鞋，請你上茶樓，一天的生活，又有着落了。</p>
<p>（五）娘姨媽子</p>
<p>弄堂口，老虎灶旁，是他們擺塲面論是非的所在，屁股那麽一拐，我們便可從她們的皺皺的唇間，聽來不少的珍貴新聞，說那家的少奶奶，白天有野漢子來伴睡；那家的眞闊綽，一天要換十來套新衣掌；那家的娘姨最苦惱，事體多外快少，買菜，少奶奶跟着去，一個銅子也不能馬處，那家的却只要在也麻將時，招呼招呼客人，白銀錢便有一厚疊；最是那一家的少奶奶眞凶，把娘姨鑿瞎了一隻眼睛，把小丫頭的鼻樑也打歪了。雖然他們都是忙碌分子，却每每能這麽道閒一二個鐘頭。有時有姘頭在旁，話匣便開向甜蜜的方向去了。這也是上海的一種典型人物。</p>
<h3>眼涙救國</h3>
<p>人們因苦惱而哭泣，苦惱之來，或受了外界强烈的壓迫，或内心感到深刻的剌激，而無法抑　，便訴之於　　　。這　是一時或清的衝動，　　意　亦很偉大丨小之能引起人家的同情大之能挽救國家的頽勢。</p>
<p>林妹妹有時和誰賭了氣，便偷偷地獨自一個兒在房中咽泣，寳哥哥看見了，連心找些溫柔的話兒來安尉牠。賽跑得不到第一的Ｘ小姐，懊傷得涙珠兒突眶而出，同學們快快掏出手帕兒爲她印乾；這是哭泣能引起人家的同情。</p>
<p>「華周杞梁之妻，善哭其夫前變國俗。伍員以吳師伐楚，申包胥入秦乞師，依庭牆而器者七日，秦伯乃遣將定其國難，這是哭泣能挽救國家的頽勢。</p>
<p>自九一八來，舉國上下，莫不以救國爲當前急務，舉凡「玉容救國」，「跳舞救國」，「時輪金剛法會救國」，「航空救國」，以及「通電」「抗議」等，都風行一時。結果，民氣消没，列强旁觀，敵兵深入，原以解除國難爲宗旨的救國方策，其所得成績如是，不禁要同聲一哭。「此路不通矣」丨自宜改行他道才對呀丨「眼涙救國」尙未有人說起道，在下不敏，且來提倡一下，凑凑熱閙。</p>
<p>我們所需要的眼淚，並不是如林妹妹和Ｘ小姐所流的兒女態的眼涙，是如申包胥杞梁妻有血氣的眼淚。我們的外交家在「弱國無外交」的今日，用口辯是枉費的，不如到羅斯福或斯丹林的面前去痛哭一塲，要救他們爲我們平定國難，申包胥是哭了七日，秦伯才肯出兵，我們的外交家就是再哭七日，也莫要心焦，祗要能達到出兵的目的就好。</p>
<p>徒有外援，而自已不着力，收效亦恐甚微！所以擁大兵愛玩内戰的諸軍爺處，也該派幾個去哭哭，哭得他們心兒酸，也祇好硬着頭皮上前線去了。</p>
<p>「哀莫大乎心死」，一般公子哥兒，少姐奶奶，日日沉醉於歌舞塲中，國難早已置在腦後了，若用溫碗的言語或惡毒的詈駡，促其醒悟，是很難的！有時反而引起他們惡感。所以也非眼涙來滌淸她們的頭腦不可。</p>
<p>涙誠是能動人的。同胞們！曷不來實行一下呢？</p>

<h3>店員通訊</h3>
<p>幾個法律問題</p>
<p>編者先生，吾的義務的法律顧問，茲以十二萬分之誠意，請你指示吾下列二事之汉律上責任，不勝韾感之至··</p>
<p>（一）吾是大公司内的小職員，月入僅能糊口，可是所負的責任倒不輕呢？吾家有一祠堂，共有祠產約四百畝左右，向由祖父經管，因不善經營，漸減至二百畝左右。祖父殁，由家你經管，又將祠產買去一百畝··現家父已於去年作古，於是祠產祠堂，由吾承繼管理（吾家習慣，祠堂祠產均由長房長子管理，一向均視爲私產··當家父將祠產出賣時，亦無族人出來講話），而現存祠產已僅一百畝矣丨（每年大約能出產一百二三十元，由吾收用）現在請問··</p>
<p>甲，如有族人出來，命我將祠產補滿四百畝，在法律上應負責任否？</p>
<p>乙，敝祠在蘇州鄉下，因江北小竊太多，無人敢在内看守，去年「一二八「時，大兵所過，將木材拆去充防禦工程及燃料，現祠堂已頽倒，無力重建，如有族人出面，强令重建則在法律上應負何項責任？</p>
<p>（二）舍戚家本小康，因生子不肖，漸政虧欠，今春又營業失敗，於是不支，現共欠約三千元，現有房至，貨物，家具，生財等約値一千五百元左右，如宜告破產約可灘得五成左右，除宣告破產外尙有其他刑事責任否（如徒刑等）？現舍戚已走，不料這位少爺也是溜之大吉，此事在法律上應負何等責任？</p>
<p>完了，吾希望你直接答覆吾丨謝謝謝謝丨敬祝</p>
<p>撰安　　　　王同和敬上</p>
<p>編者近··關於第一個問題，應當歸咎於習慣的不良。查祠堂祠產，無論當時爲長房獨力捐置，抑係闔族損建。顧名思義，應爲闔族所其有；豈能視爲長房之私產。爾祖若父，旣已濫用職權；闔族長幼，又復放棄不問。爲今之計，似應由王君出面，邀集族人，一面聲明將祠產還諸族人，一面聲明，放棄此每年一百二三十元之收入。所有祖若父經手之事，族人旣已放棄在前，現在祇有請求追認；王君經手之事，則當詳爲報告。重建與否，聽諸闔族公意可也。</p>
<p>關於第二個問題，令親因生子不肖，營業失敗，致虧負約三千金左右，除將房屋，貨物，家具，生財作抵外，約虧洋一千五百金左右。此事本可申請法院，依照破產法辦理；倘無隱匿情事，原可不負其他刑事責任。不過父子現在雙雙出走，不免使人懷疑耳。但事歸實在，倘無隱惹情弊，目下仍以挻身而出爲是；如有隱惹，則當自動宣佈。否則各債權人，可以虧欵潛逃，向法院控訴。房屋，貨物，家具，生財，不免被扣；而令親父子，更須緝拿歸案。到那個時候，雖說没有隱惹，恐怕就没有人相信了。</p>

<h3>從「春江花月夜」的歌曲說到新興音樂（下）</h3>
<p>— 任西達</p>
<p>但是到了一九三三年的現在，資本主義已進到最後的矛盾期。機器的發展，反而成了資本主義運命中惡魔。資產階級是這樣的不能樂觀。於是所有一切誇張機器，麻醉人類的音樂，就再不夠給人麻醉，再不夠代表社會生活和憤感了。因此資本主義的「爵士」音樂，也隨着資本主義的運命，進到了最後的没落時期，不能再行發展。</p>
<p>正在這過渡時期中，「新興」音樂還没有普遍發展，舊的音樂又失了時代性的時候；同時没落的歐美資產階級，再没有力量發展他新的階級藝術。於是一般在資本主義中找出路的小資產階級，例尋找到了資本主義以前的貴族音樂，他們覺得這種幽靜的情調，還可給人一點回憶的快活。於是他們便挅取了「春江花夜月」裏的歌曲，和「姚花村」裏的歌曲，作一種把農業時代音樂，給牠現代化的試探。那麽很明顯的這種音樂絕不合於現代的時代需要，因此的壽命，也必不能長久，將要不等資本主義的没落，而先期死亡。</p>
<p>現在的電影和音樂差不多是不能分開，而必是調和的東西。音樂旣是變遷了。同樣的，電影畫片也轉移了方面。牠由談大資本主義發狂的影片，轉移到沉默和諷剌了。因此這資本主義的騎士「好萊塢」也便由美國而移入了歐洲，但是歐洲如果是把「好萊塢」整個的搬來，仍舊去作資本主義爭疆的騎士，牠會和美國的「好萊塢」一樣，行不能！因此我們知道，如果想在歐洲建立起第二「好萊塢」的話，那必是牠的電影不僅不是資本主義的騎士，反而是資本主義的輓郎。將來代替一切舊音樂的，是新寫實派，大衆化音樂。這種音樂不論在形式上，性質上，都是嶄新的，進步的音樂。特别是將來社會旣是更進步，更有組織的工業化社會，因此代表機器力量的「爵士」音樂，在將來「新興」音樂的形式上，不僅是不把這種特點消滅，而且更有力的給牠「組織化」「大衆化」。同時在情感上必是完全消滅牠的「麻醉性」，而換爲深刻的最大多數人羣的呼喊和力量。建立新興音樂藝術，偉大的價値與成功！代替一切舊時代裏，種種個人的，以及麻醉的音樂而獨立！（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「莫斯科之英雄」</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>（Cleer　all　Wires）</p>
<p>俄國影片，在上海已演了三部，體裁完全是抵毁世界經濟的没落，資產的崩潰，和社會的不安，來反襯出社會主義的光坦之路。當然，資本的國家，也不肯甘休而要反唇相譏的，因此「莫斯科之英雄」Clcar　all　Wires也就應時而產生了。</p>
<p>這是一張幽默式的滑稽片，諷剌蘇俄政府的無聊和民衆的受愚，海從這些材料裏造出一種卑視侮辱他們的笑料來。它旣是一張自認爲滑稽的影片，演出時候的不合理，我們似乎也無庸深究了。</p>
<p>劇意是有的，不過只是對於社會主義的攻擊，發揚美國人的「英雄精神，」</p>
<p>在這一點我覺得原動方面有一些像三年前的「不怕死」Welcome　Danger。</p>
<p>故事倒並不怎麽特出，只爲說一個美國駐莫斯科的記者，因爲了報館經理的愛人而被辭職，他於是唆人去殺死一個白俄貴族，以便藉此消息圖謀復職，不料助手誤會了而去殺一個赤俄警長。他恐怕惹禍，便捨身相護，警長幸賴無恙，而他自已了鎗傷。於是他被赤俄，稱爲「莫斯科之英雄」，而這段新聞，抬高了斯他的身價。不久，他就復職，而和他的戀人結了婚，來作駐中國的記者了。</p>
<p>的確，蘇俄第一個五年計劃成功以後，住房問題，還没有解决。（見蘇俄視察記）這片子，緊緊抓住了這個弱點來發揮，但是内中描寫過當，關於蘇俄物質生活和蘇俄人士丨丨上自政府委員下至小工丨丨的愚笨昏庸和不道德，都是呌人不能相信的。牠目的是要使人們對於社會主義的厭惡，但是結查只暴露了美國新聞記者人格的卑鄙。</p>
<p>關於技巧，導演除去一些莫明其妙，想入非非的挖苦蘇俄的笑料以外，就找不出什麽。鏡頭有幾個還可以算聰明的，光線在一張滑稽片裏，本來不吃重的，這裏也是平平。對白比普通英國片還多，發音還好。對白中的詼諧字句多半是詈駡蘇俄的「俏皮話」。</p>
<p>飾那個記者的「李屈死」Lee　Tracv把美國新聞記者形容得一無骨氣，眞像一個「屈死」，表演還不失爲一位「幽點至骨稽的明星」。兩個女角BenitaHume,Una　Merkel都平常得很，除一些妖艶肉感以外，一無可取。</p>
<p>佈景故意簡陋，把莫斯科寫得像鬼城似的，也許美國人對於這一點，特别滿意吧？</p>
<p>總之，牠是一張爲資本主義吐氣，而向蘇俄進攻，出乎常情的滑稽片。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>評「春水情波」</h3>
<p>— 芳龍</p>
<p>從影片的序幕上。我們知道「春水</p>
<h3>善操英德法三國語言的麗琳哈惠現已成爲歐美雙方爭奪之恩物，但好萊塢正在想　方汉留她在美國。這就是她最近的照相。</h3>
<p>情波」是脫胎於小說「隱刑」的，可是片中的情節，却又和「隱刑」不很相同，而且有許多竟失了該書的原意，這也許是著作者和編劇者所抓住意旨的重心，各有不司的原故。</p>
<p>本片意識，尙屬取，縱使不能博取每個人的滿意··但至少已指出了勢利婚姻的虚僞，冒失愛情的危險，和被玩弄的女姓們應有學悟。其他對於財迷官迷，土豪劣紳，封建勢力的餘毒，以及劇末民族團結的需要等等，都有相當的發揮。</p>
<p>全劇最値得注意的一點，是喊出了西北墾殖的口號。東南的蜜度激境，和邊隅的荒偏廢；形成了中國整個的畸形荏弱。對於經濟崩漬，農村破產等問題，無不發生直接的影響。「春水情波」爲救三年之艾，首起提倡，這不是很値得稱贊的嗎？</p>
<p>導演很努力，雖然找不出什麽傑出特點，但全劇劇情的開展，和演出的節奏，都能不失協和的諧調，與緊張的情緒。尢其内容和形式，發展得平衡而適當，始终抓得住觀衆的情感。對於劇中各個被玩弄者的悲哀，各人覺悟的環境之啓迪，轉變的動機，奮鬭的途徑，以及各片段的銜接，處處顯露得出導演者卓立的作風。技巧主面，也見到相當匠心，至少導演手腕，是縝密的。</p>
<p>說到演員的表演，胡蝶面部表情很好，幾個特寫更見精彩。孫敏表演，有兩塲還顯得眞切。胡萍表演的機會雖少，可是成績很好。嚴月嫻也還不錯。</p>
<p>佈景很美，取景也大體不錯。不過春水湖的水面太狹，簡直像小溪，未免美中不足。鏡頭位置，攝影光線，等都還好，字幕也給了相當的帮助。</p>
<p>總之，「春水情波」是一本進步的影片··多少總給予觀衆一點良好的印象雖然稍微缺乏些兒剌激性。</p>
<h3>蘇俄電影概况（三）</h3>
<p>— 魯道夫梅蘇民著</p>
<p>（二）蘇俄電影事業之計劃</p>
<p>在蘇維埃聯邦全境之内，電影事業爲言傳上最重要之工具。他種工業，旣悉有審愼詳盡之規畫，電影事業，當亦不能獨居例外。蘇俄在全國電影宣傅便利著想上，將全國分爲區域；以廣義而言，此等區域亦猶之指南針上東南西北四極也。在每一區域内，有一中心生產塲所之組織，蓋即一大攝影塲也。此大攝影塲有控制管理區内各重要地點所分設各小攝影塲之威權。而大攝影場復隸屬於莫斯科之全國電影聯合會（Ail　Union　Cinema　Sojus或Kint）。全國電影聯合會者，操縱全國影業之大權；對於各區生產場所於必有經濟維持之責；各區攝影場之出品，亦出其接受支配；并隨時監督及指導各區事務之進行。但以事實而言，各區这分組織，頗有自由之享受而不受父母組織之非份干與，而父母組織所頒有之命令，亦僅限於所需於各區攝影場影片之長度，至於影片之内容題材等等絕少干預也。</p>
<p>蘇國當局所以必需在各區設立中心生產塲所者，以便於中央組織之將描寫某一區生活狀况之影片分佈於全國其他區域也。高多索區之生活文化與日耳曼，伏　加或西伯利亞之生活文化，自大不相同，但蘇聯當局深信描寫各區生活狀况之影片倘能互相交換權輸，非但可以資人民之觀感，并且可因此而發生人民間團結之思想及引起合作之責任。</p>
<p>彼等復謂，使士耳其斯坦之居著，能目覩與彼等生活完全不同之高加索人動作之畫片，足以使彼輩感覺人種生活雖不同而爲社會主義而工作嵵睛…如是則退化民族所常自覺之孤陋寡聞與世隔絕之情緒，可以排除。如是則土耳其斯坦之人民可由影片而覺悟彼等自身之不孤立，且屬大計劃之一部份，同爲社會主義之建設而盡力，固無分種族與畛域也。至於此等民族所懷之種種　懼如對於特殊習俗之壓迫禁止等等，亦可因電影宣傳之簡單方式而使之鎭靜也。</p>

<h3>論萬國式建築　黄影呆</h3>
<p>在過去十年之中。產生了好多的生義。但現在已到達了窮盡的時期了。我們走到歐洲各大城市。尤其是在美國。一切的建築物。早已被現代建築所破壞了。所謂現代主義者。並不是專指建築術。這種計劃。在運用各種不同的新式。他們對於外觀的别緻。已發生了濃厚的趣味。而並不是在利用新的原料。以建築房屋。使適於器物。速度。經濟等問題。這種現代主義的建築家。對於窗門的斜線或直綫。黑的。白的。和其他各種顏色的磚頭。瓦。和三合士。一切的形式和顏色。有光彩的金屬。特别的木料。和各種裝飾物。能面面顧到。而極端的去注意所謂現代主義的建築家。他們在規劃建築物的時侯。對於外面的斜柱。很注意。而對於内部柱子撑到屋頂的。却當做不重要的問題。在頂上那些圓柱有特别的裝飾，有的用花石，有的用具體的裝飾，在窗的中間，距離的地方。也用特别的鐵板或磚石，使得一切的一切。和以前是不同的。他們假定所有的房屋。正面都要具體的。或是用花石的玻璃的。而所有屋角。便都應用玻璃。進口的走道。尤其是别緻。模倣的磚石。砌成不是平常的牆壁。什麽都有一種奇特的色彩。現代主義者。對於房屋的内部建業的計劃。他們以爲一切現代的器物。都含有不安全的性質。我記得有一次在街市上。發生了一種有趣的笑話。一個現代主義的建築家。彎着腰走過。一個朋友問道。「你有些什麽不好。腰痛嗎」。他這樣答道。「不是。那不是腰痛。而是現代的器物。」</p>
<p>所謂現代建築。目前所最是盛行的。畢建築一些不同式樣的房屋。目前不在求房屋的本身。能永久存在。而祗求房屋具有一種特性。而主要的條件。在求使钱切能滿足。那麽這種房屋。究竟要合乎那幾種條件呢。簡單的說來就在合於現代的一切。什麽都能調和而一致。整潔和簡單。具有特殊的色彩。每一間屋子。彼此都不會抵觸。所有物質上。精神上。一切的需要。都是滿足的。在四千年來建築術上一切的方法。現在我們是没有興趣再去模倣了。而與我們更是没有關係。所具的價値。早已不再存在。而因爲建築術革命的結果。人們所具的舊觀念。也早已完全消滅了。有許多廿世紀的藝術建築家。他們說在建築學上。因爲實業發展的結果。所謂藝術。早已死滅了。而現時代之下。所謂藝術的進化中。所產生的建築物。早已把建築物的美的。完全消除了。就事實方面說。新的建築物。用新的物質。像鋼鐵。水泥。玻璃等等來建造。我們都可以看見的。但他們對於藝術却不十分注意。至於古代的建築。却不是如此。他們的建築。偏重於精神。而對於屋内的裝飾。尤其是當爲重要的事項。但現代建築。所認爲重要的質素。却和以前是完全不同的。我們齊巧立有一個時代的開端。因爲我們在技術上具有最後的能力。而現在知道建築術是在革命。而產生種種以前所没有的形式了。然而採用了新的物質。在標準以上的人類生活上。人類和工商業。進展得如此神速的時候。建築術上又究竟將發生什樣的重要變化呢。在構造房屋的時候。我們採用一切新的物質。當做材料。然而我們仍舊套了假面具。用了幾千年來屋内裝飾方法來掩飾新的建築物。而更有一種謬誤。把這種房屋。假裝一種現代的建築。這些現代的建築原料。事實上又是否能帮助我們去建造那些銀行的屋子。火車站。和各種辦公室。機房。各種私人住宅。增進外觀的美麗。而我們又是否都在利用這些機能。我們對於這些建築。是否抱忠實的態度。然而我們對於一切太耗費而没有功用的房屋。都發生一種厭惡的。而我們完全抱了忠實的態度。來應付一切建築物的。」</p>
<p>「我曾經在一個很著名的實業中心的城市中。發現一個一九三一年所建造的橡皮廠。外面用三合土建成埃及的式樣外面更彫成獅身人像。荷花。荷葉。什麽東西都有。和半哩之外。一所用水泥鋼骨來建造的廠屋相對之下。這屋子什麽都令人感到厭惡呢。火車站。銀行辦公室。公寓。棧房。這些房屋。外觀各有不同的式樣有的模倣希臘的古廟。有的倣難馬的皇宮。以至復興後的敎堂。這些錯綜雜亂的房屋。我們目覩之下。幾乎要頭昏眼暗。很大的石子或大理石的石柱。毫無功效的。加上醜態的裝飾物。配在現代的建築物上。自必令人厭惡而感覺到建築術的虚僞了。那麽誰能利用新的原料而建造時代的建築物呢。當然我們這一般大膽的工程師去負此重大的使命。他們曾經建造過航洋的大船。各種辦公室。銀行辦公室。工程師還建築橋樑。礦室。鐵路。油站。發電室。動力室。飛機。飛船。和其他一切現代機件。工廠高大的多層房屋。第一層是玻璃的。鋼骨圓柱也很細。而上面可以建造六十層的房屋。這些工程師。用了算術的方法來產生這些建築。使自然律的限制。而建成這種時代建築。使我們感到什麽都是音調和合的。我們並不是把古代一切的建築式都檳棄了。他們不是一意去模倣意大利文藝復興式的房屋。簡括的說來。這些新的建築物。是把古代的建築。取其長而去其短。然後再利用種種新的方法。來應用在時代建築物的上面。」</p>
<p>「我們祇要看到美國。加拿大。大宜諾斯艾爾斯等地的積穀倉。扛重機。是這個新世紀的所產生的最初果實。工程師並不在熱烈的追求一個建築術的正確理論。祇是抱着一種冷淡鎭靜的態度。而由控制宇宙的一種原理的領導。得到一個估計的方法。我們祗要看到一切現代工程上的美學。從紐約到支加哥的自動火車。法國的寢室車。德國的齊柏林飛船。英國航洋巨艦。意國的飛機。瑞士的坦克車。機械上。電力上。使得今日的世界。形成一個特殊的景象。而且有實際的能力和勇氣。去使這個景氣的實現。他們用現代的物質。建成現代的式樣。而舊式中的不合時代。毫無效果和用意的一切陳腐的。完全擯棄無餘。建築術上的生命。在一條狹隘的路上動作的時代。現在已到了末日的時期。而到達一種新的精神產生的時期。所有的工程師。都可運用了淸晰的觀念。去從事建築。使時代的建築物。隨着時代而無窮盡的產生。」</p>
<h3>論現代建築和室内佈置　影</h3>
<p>在歐洲和美洲，過去幾年中，好多的建築物，都傾向於時代建築的運動方式，以本國的固有建築式爲基礎，而另外便仿照所有建築式，截長補短，以求建築特的日益完美，這種建築物的產生，唯一的原因，就在受了現代生活的影響，現在的房屋，在一個指定的區域之中，我們在建築的時候，一切都應合於科學化的，使得一間房屋，我們住在裏面，好像一架要機器，一般的建築師。正在深思熟慮，擯棄一切屋的外面的那種不需要的裝飾，内部的裝飾物也是如此，而極力的在經濟方面，作用方面着重，明白的說一句，就是使建築物，有偉大的作用，和適合經濟的原理，一般的婦人，大概從事於活動的職業，或社會生活，她們都希望用最少的力最，而換得最多的愉快，祗要把一個神秘的關鍵，一觸她們所需要的東西，熱水或冷水，熱氣或冷氣，或一間屋子裏，或是滿宅的屋子裏，都可隨心所欲了，用電力來燃燈或烹飪，在電氣的冷氣室裏，可以把全度的飯菜保存着，祇要把她的手腕一轉，她便可預備一度請國王吃的酒菜，在没有火光的電灶上，她可烹飪各種的飯菜，而在桇子上又隨時可把罐頭食物取下來開聽，電力眞空淸潔器，和縫衣器的聲響，在主婦們聽來，好像無線電裏的音樂，或比亞那的演奏聲，完全相同，在一間現代式的房屋之中，所有的一切設備，在在可減少工作時間，好像一架打字機，非常的神速，而又非常的合用，外面的形式，利用了羅輯的方式，而决定一切，至於内部也這麽都和外部吻合，我們如果把作用問題，詳細的研究起來，那麽也許並不是在一間房屋，關頭建築的時候，和出發點有連帶的關係，所用的建築原料，什麽都有一種自然和忠實的表示，而對於一切房屋裏面的物件，並没有一種不適的情狀，和建築的要素，並無密切關係的。</p>
<p>房屋的裏面，地面一定要自由，各間屋子，留着空地，面積的大小，都須有相當的作用，器物的搬運，人們的來往，都應使之能節省時間，在屋子裏面，臥室和操作家事的地方，所留的空地，應該得當，尤其是日光照着的地方，新工建築的原料·鋼鐵·堅質·玻璃，和其他各種金屬，使得能夠建成一種寬大的光線，充足的房屋，而同時可節省好多的原料，比起以前的建築物，彼此相去很多，而且從前的又在在是不適應用的，從前建的築物，所有牆壁，力使寬大，而門窗的孔隙，力使減少，可是現代建築呢，這種方式完全擯棄了，房屋的重量，全部擱置在純鋼的骨子上面，或是其他的骨子上，天花板地板，也没有什麽正面，地板方面，完全由自身支撑，而同時又有力量去抵抗環境，熱氣冷氣和䀨耳的聲息，現在我們都主張外面有極强的光線射入，所以科學家有一種玻璃，發明這種玻璃，光線完全可以穿射過的，因此窗便成爲一間屋子中主要的原緊了，所有的牆壁，現在差不多完全要用玻璃窗替代了，一間屋子，果如建築在一個現代化的城市之中，那就要用種種的方法去　握光線，許多的空隙，留着裝窗的，使得住在裏面的人，和户外生活多所接觸，而揆諸今日的情狀，也是大勢所趨，因現代文明的需要而然。</p>
<p>現代的建築，牠的作用，究竟是什麽呢，在理想上的目的，計劃，和構造，固完全一致的，所有的房屋，隔離的得宜，使得美觀方面，達於是高的限度，而同時更使房屋的建築，配重適當，構造和合，當一般建築師在建築房屋而規劃之初，對於美觀問題，極度注意。</p>

<h3>Peace Negotiations Limited to Military Scope</h3>
<p>Attending Representatives Limited to Military Personnel</p>
<p>Negotiation Location Already Decided</p>
<p>Both Sides' Armies to Withdraw Thirty Li Each</p>
<p>(Peiping) The oral negotiations between the representatives of both sides on the matter of peace have concluded. Going forward, further liaison should occur. Regarding the location for discussing the armistice agreement and the location for the representatives to negotiate, the proposals of both sides are not yet aligned. Each side has five or six representatives, and the number of expert committee members has not yet been determined. After some discussion, all can be determined. Yesterday, the armies of both sides decided to withdraw thirty li each, so that the distance between the two armies is greater, avoiding further conflicts during the negotiations and increasing the difficulty of peaceful progress. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The preliminary agreement on peace, in addition to specifying the locations for troop withdrawal on both sides, contains no specific conditions. Both sides declared an oral agreement that the location for formally discussing the agreement is set at a certain place. This negotiation still falls within the military scope, and the attending representatives are limited to military personnel, with only expert committee members attached. The areas from which the armies of both sides withdraw will avoid the use of words like "buffer" or "neutral," or armed zones as requested by the Japanese side. Diplomatic issues will be discussed after Arima arrives in Peiping. Last night, one side held talks with diplomatic circles, and the planned future steps are extensive. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to Chinese sources, the armistice negotiations are progressing quite smoothly, but the formal agreement will still require several days before it can be signed. Furthermore, according to responsible sources, the negotiations are currently limited to military matters, and the rumors of discussing political disputes are unfounded. Last night, He Yingqin convened an important meeting of military leaders that lasted until after midnight. The local situation and the Sino-Japanese negotiation issues were all discussed. The lines of defense of all sides are currently quiet. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) The ceasefire agreement has become concrete. The commander of the Kwantung Army, Mutō, dispatched the destroyer Yūgure of the destroyer squadron to Tanggu at 1:30 PM on the 29th as a signing representative. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) In recent days, there have been widespread rumors from all sides that the Sino-Japanese ceasefire measures have been signed by representatives of both sides. As the matter is important, this reporter specifically visited a certain authority to inquire about the truth. According to a certain responsible official, our side only dispatched a certain staff officer to the Japanese headquarters. When making oral contact, he carried credentials as a military envoy. Apart from this, there has been absolutely no other expression to the Japanese side. The various rumors circulating are purely speculative and absolutely incorrect. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to a certain person closest to Huang Fu, the formal meeting for the Sino-Japanese armistice will begin discussions as soon as the representatives are appointed. The location of the meeting may be in Tanggu, but this has not yet been decided. When asked whether it is true that China has sent six people to participate in the meeting, the spokesperson replied that the list of Chinese representatives has been internally determined, but they have not been formally appointed. He also said that, in addition to military leaders, there will also be civil servants related to military affairs among the Chinese representatives. Both the Chinese and Japanese sides have emphatically stated that future meetings will be limited to discussing military matters and will not involve diplomatic or political issues. It is understood that the meeting will not only discuss the ceasefire and the withdrawal of troops by both sides, but also discuss the issue of establishing a non-militarized zone.

<h3>Garrisoned Troops in Peiping Increased to 2,500</h3>
<p>Exceeding the Restrictions of the Boxer Protocol Several Times Over</p>
<p>(Peiping) The garrisons of various countries in Peiping are limited according to the provisions of the Boxer Protocol. Recently, the Japanese garrison again arrived with more than 500 men from Tientsin. According to the provisions of the treaty, the number previously stationed in this city was 300 men. Currently, the Japanese side is using the pretext of protecting residents to increase troops in Peiping. The total number of Japanese troops stationed in Peiping, including their resident militia and veterans, is approximately 2,500, exceeding the restrictions of the Boxer Protocol several times over. Our authorities are paying close attention. Furthermore, the 40 to 50 men of the First Battalion of the Japanese North China Dispatch Army arrived in Tientsin yesterday aboard the Tencho Maru.

<h3>Majority of Japanese Troops Concentrated Near Tangshan</h3>
<p>No Appearance of Moving Westward</p>
<p>(Peiping) Tanggu dispatch: The majority of the Japanese troops, approximately 2,000 men, are still garrisoned near Kaiping and Tangshan, showing no signs of moving westward. West of Tangshan to Xugezhuang, there are over 300 Japanese troops stationed along the way. The puppet troops, originally stationed at a certain location east of Lutai, are in a confrontational state with those in the Xugezhuang area. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Xugezhuang is still garrisoned by 200 to 300 Japanese troops and approximately 1,000 puppet troops. The majority of the Japanese troops are concentrated in Tangshan. In the Fengrun area, there are also over 2,000 Japanese troops and approximately 500 to 600 puppet troops, carrying over 30 armored tanks. There has been no action in recent days. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Sun Dianying's representative, Wang Shiping, returned to Peiping from Chahar last night to meet with He Yingqin, reporting on the current garrison situation of Sun's troops in the eastern Chahar area. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Sentries at Luofa Open Fire to Provoke Us</h3>
<p>Our Troops Retreated to Avoid Incident</p>
<p>(Tientsin) More than 300 Japanese troops are stationed in Zhangzhuang, Luofa, Langfang, all encamped outside the station. It is confirmed that two-thirds of them are disguised puppet troops. The Japanese troops in Luofa moved out more than 50 men at 4:00 PM on the 28th, their destination unknown.

<h3>Great Prison Break in Changchun</h3>
<p>Seventy-Eight Escape</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to the announcement of the (puppet) Manchukuo Police Department, at 7:00 PM on the 28th, seventy-eight out of 171 inmates in the Jilin First Prison in Changchun City escaped. Thirty-three were arrested, four were killed, and three were arrested after being wounded. The remaining forty or so were being seriously searched by two (puppet) police squadrons mobilized after 8:00 PM. An emergency meeting was held by the heads of the headhunters including the village sub-team leader Sakata and the capital police chief at the city's military police substation. However, the prisoners all had handcuffs and could not escape far. Also according to the military police's announcement, among the eighty unconvicted prisoners in Changchun City, those in a neighboring cell at the detention center broke the door at 6:00 PM last night, broke into the detention center, beat the guards, stole several rifles and 116 rounds of ammunition, and fled towards the Ministry of Justice. Upon receiving this urgent news, the military police and police immediately went on alert. The cause of the prison break was premeditation, taking advantage of the Dragon Boat Festival to reduce the number of guards by two, and thus taking the opportunity to attempt an escape. (29th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The facilities at the Jilin Prison, which triggered the prison break, are extremely incomplete, and the prison cells where this prison break's prisoners were housed are no different from ordinary residential buildings, merely supplemented with wooden partitions. Furthermore, the doors were not locked. What's more, last night happened to be the Dragon Boat Festival, and only two guards were left, which naturally caused the issue of responsibility for those in charge. According to Abiryu, the Director-General of the Judicial Ministry, the prison break is a great misfortune on the face of the capital. The prison was a temporary place to imprison bandits during the old warlord era, and at that time, they were all shot, so it seemed unnecessary to have permanent facilities. In today's new era, due to budget constraints, it has not been improved, so this responsibility cannot be solely attributed to the guards. A prison system training institute will soon be established to train guards and strive to guide prisoners' work and education, and they plan to find ways to prevent future prison breaks.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Eighth Anniversary of the May 30th Incident - Zi</h3>
<p>The May 30th Incident, which occupies an important position in the history of the Chinese national movement, has reached its eighth anniversary today. Recalling May 30th, 1925, the conflict between over a thousand people and dozens of police officers on Nanjing Road in Shanghai escalated into a tragedy with over twenty deaths and injuries. This led to a major strike throughout Shanghai. Furthermore, the Han, Xun, Yue, Yu, and Ning massacres followed one after another. The people of all China cooperated and fought together to complete a magnificent national movement. Its impact was that internally, it created the foundation for a national mass united revolution, and externally, it made the powerful countries have a considerable understanding of the awakening of the Chinese nation. Although the negotiations were not a complete victory, the historical course of the incident is enough to give the Chinese nation hope for its future.</p>
<p>The May 30th Incident was not just about the deaths and injuries of twenty-odd people, nor was it just about dealing with those directly responsible or a certain country. It was also not just a single incident that started with the labor unrest four months prior. It was a major movement for the Chinese nation to seek independence and survival. The reason for this was the decades of humiliation suffered by China externally and the history of active aggression against China by various countries. The basic substance was the acceptance of the global national movement by 400 million Chinese people, and the national will that was thus expressed. The result of this, up to eight years later, can be said not to have been obtained. Therefore, when we commemorate the incident, we should not focus on the temporary bloodshed tragedy, but should place importance on the background that created this bloodshed tragedy. We should not limit ourselves to mourning the martyrs of the May 30th Incident, but should consider how the independence and survival of the Chinese nation are threatened today.</p>
<p>Our people's resistance to Japan has reached the point where it has gone from the arduous struggles of the military and civilians to the authorities discussing a ceasefire today. Commemorating this incident, which demanded national independence and survival, is truly filled with grief and indignation. Although Japan's military capabilities are sufficient to temporarily occupy more than four provinces of our land, sufficient to destroy our hard-worked and unprotected villages and towns, sufficient to massacre the majority of our military and civilians whose resistance capabilities are not yet sufficient, and sufficient to pressure us into ceasefire negotiations on the front lines, they can never cut off the will of our entire nation to continue to struggle. If our nation can avoid falling into decline, can be inspired to become strong, and can continue to develop our national will, then there will be a day when the May 30th Incident, eight years ago, opened the end of our nation's struggle. From now on, we must follow the path to seek the elimination of threats to national independence and survival. The future is bright; let the people of the country move forward.</p>
<p>Since the Xinhai Revolution until the May 30th Incident, the number of people actually participating in the struggle in the Chinese national movement has increased daily, and the organization and capabilities have also expanded daily. Although the country targeted by the May 30th Incident did not show submission, it actually saw the opportunity and made concessions. If the Chinese national movement can continue to advance vigorously in the future, combining the strength of the entire nation and with tight organizations, then the final result will be sufficient to make those who infringe upon our independence and threaten our survival receive the lessons they deserve. The matter rests on the efforts of the people of the country.</p>
<h3>Japan Fears Resistance to Goods</h3>
<p>Ishii States in New York to Journalists</p>
<p>Will Submit Plans to Address at the Economic Conference</p>
<p>(New York) Ishii, the Japanese representative attending the World Economic Conference, arrived here today from Washington and told reporters that he will submit plans to address the Chinese policy of rejecting Japanese goods at the Economic Conference. Ishii pointed to Chinese resistance as the biggest obstacle in commerce and said that he already has a way to subdue Chinese resistance. He believes that resistance is an action that endangers the entire world, and he will submit his plan to the Economic Conference after it is drafted. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Side Is Self-Satisfied</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the meeting of representatives Ishii and Fukai with the US President in Washington had a major impact on the US government's new policy toward the Far East and is watching its progress with the utmost attention. The US President made it clear to representative Ishii that the Manchuria problem will no longer be discussed and that attention will be paid to promoting stability in the Far East in the future. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed satisfaction with this statement, namely that the United States hopes to cooperate with the Far East and Western countries and make an important foundation for world peace and prosperity policies, and to remove the current world unrest, advocates rational solutions to economic and transport reductions. It is different from the policies of previous US Republican governments. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also recognizes this as a practical policy and is very satisfied. The Ministry believes that the results of this meeting between Japanese and American representatives will definitely improve the previous relationship between Japan and the United States and the entire relationship between China and Japan. (29th Nichiren Dispatch)</p>
<p>Ishii's Schedule in the United States</p>
<p>(New York) Ishii, Fukai and other plenipotentiaries arrived in New York from Washington at 4:00 PM today and immediately entered the Pierre Hotel for a meeting with the press corps.

<h3>Japan Plans to Interfere with China's Tariff Autonomy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The National Government implemented increased tariffs starting May 22nd. The Foreign Ministry instructed Consul-General Ishisha in Shanghai to investigate, as the tariffs have a significant impact on Japan's trade with China. It has been decided to lodge a protest with the National Government, and Minister Arima has been telegraphed with the following protest: "Your country's increase in tariffs has severely impacted Japanese trade and harmed friendly Sino-Japanese relations, which is deeply regrettable. We respectfully request reconsideration." (29th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Report on Trade of National Goods in the Nanyang Islands</h3>
<p>Tea Suffers from Taiwan Tea Dumping and Low Prices</p>
<p>Porcelain Industry Needs Improvement to Compete with Japanese Goods</p>
<p>(Singapore) The Chinese Consul-General in Singapore and other Chinese representatives in Nanyang have issued similar reports on the general situation of trade in Chinese products. The general gist is that items such as cotton cloth, leather suitcases, and flashlights are selling well and at reasonable prices. The high value of the Singapore dollar is favorable for Chinese products. However, Chinese tea has suffered a significant decline due to competition from Taiwanese tea. Taiwan currently ships 8 million kilograms of tea annually to Java and Sumatra, and 3 million kilograms to Malaya, while Chinese tea only ships 1 million kilograms to Java and Sumatra, and 500,000 kilograms to Malaya. Japanese porcelain has low prices and good designs, coupled with the low value of the Japanese yen, making it a competitor for the Chinese porcelain industry. Although Chinese merchants in this industry encourage overseas Chinese with patriotic appeals, the effect is limited, and it is ultimately difficult to compete with Japanese porcelain. Chinese manufactured goods have gained a foothold in the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya. The general situation in the past twelve months is considered good, but Chinese canned food has encountered setbacks because the supply and sale prices of fresh goods in various parts of Nanyang are already low.

<h3>Russian Pravda Exposes Japan's Conspiracy to Invade China</h3>
<p>Plans to Occupy Chahar Province in Hopes of Invading the Northwest</p>
<p>Seizing Railways in North China to Penetrate the Interior</p>
<p>Building Military Ports and Annexing the Yellow Sea</p>
<p>(Moscow) A commentary in the Pravda newspaper on the 27th stated that Japan is attempting to establish a new country in North China, similar to "Manchukuo," bounded by the Yellow River, and therefore cannot relax its grip on Shandong. Japan's objectives are threefold: (1) to turn Manchuria into a colony; (2) to establish administrative power in North China and gradually expand it to the entire country; and (3) to ultimately use the Chinese Empire to eliminate the Chinese Revolution. In the Northeast, it will inevitably further invade the Northwest. Its occupation of Chahar Province can be seen as a prelude to advancing north, west, and northwest. Progress in the northern direction will not provoke the opposition of Britain and the United States as much as invasion of the southwest. Therefore, it is a misunderstanding to say that Japan's aggression will end after it obtains the area north of the Great Wall. The newspaper also stated that what Japan pays particular attention to is the control of the railways of Liaoning-Tianjin, Ping-Zhangjiakou, and Baotou. If these railways are connected to the Pusan-Yang railways, the importance of their military and economic significance to Japan can be imagined. To the south of these railways are China's two major railways (referring to Tianjin-Pukou and Beijing-Hankou). To the west is the main road from Xinpukou to Beijing. By occupying these, Japan can not only extensively exploit all the resources of China but also have a base for penetrating China and Mongolia. The newspaper also stated that in order to secure transportation to North China and Hokkaido, Japan will establish administrative control over the Yellow River. Japan has built the Tsugaru naval base near Busan, and now it is restoring the Lushun military port. If Japan occupies Qingdao as a second base in the future, then the Yellow Sea will forever be without the shadow of national warships. Japan's various plans are related to preparations for war on the East Asian continent and war against the United States. (27th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Talk of Moving the World Economic Conference to Geneva</h3>
<p>To Coordinate with the Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>British Proposal for Aerial Bombing Retains Reservations</p>
<p>Vehemently Criticized by Russian Representatives</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations is currently working hard to move the venue of the World Economic Conference from London to Geneva. The biggest reason is that it is difficult to hope for the conclusion of the Disarmament Conference before the opening of the Economic Conference. Therefore, if the Economic Conference is to open on June 12th, it would be better to hold the two conferences in the same location, to avoid the dispersion and involvement of representatives from various countries. Furthermore, holding the two conferences in the same location can not only save time and economic resources but also bring many conveniences in terms of work. Moreover, the agreements reached at each conference can promote the progress of other conferences. (29th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The British representative's request to retain the right to exercise "police powers" through bombing aircraft in "remote areas" was vehemently criticized by Soviet representative Stein today. Stein firmly insisted that Britain must remove Article 34 from its plan. It is said that we have not seen any government that has requested to exercise its police powers by aerial bombing over its people in remote areas, such as in colonies. The geographical term "remote areas" can be interpreted by any country as it pleases. Therefore, the Soviet delegation will in no way allow the retention of that part of Article 34 in the British plan. Regarding a certain country's representative's proposal to add the words "outside of Europe" to this reservation, Stein declared, "I do not understand why the people of continents outside of Europe should be specially granted the right to be bombed by aircraft."

<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Peng Gu has arrived in Geneva and will personally attend the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference. The committee will continue to discuss the definition of "aggressor" in the afternoon (29th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov is expected to arrive in Geneva tomorrow, Tuesday. (29th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from the Matsudaira Embassy in the United Kingdom, after the World Economic Conference opens in London on June 12th, it will be moved to Geneva. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has expressed great dissatisfaction with this report. Since Geneva is the place where Japan broke with the League of Nations, Japan is unwilling to participate in world conferences there again. Moreover, since its purpose is to conduct the Disarmament and Economic Conferences simultaneously, Japan, although participating in the Economic Conference to overcome domestic economic difficulties and hoping that the conference can achieve its goals, does not want to be interfered with by the world regarding disarmament issues because its continental policy has not been completed. It is heard that Foreign Minister Uchida will order the ambassadors stationed in the major powers of Britain, the United States, France, Germany, and Italy to vehemently oppose it. (29th, China United News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Special Committee on Armaments of the Disarmament Conference met this morning. French representative Jouart made strong remarks, stating that the French delegation will immediately submit a proposal to the Presidium of the General Assembly in the form of amendments, as an annex to the British Disarmament Plan, advocating for the restriction of national defense expenditures and the crackdown on the public and private manufacturing industries of armaments and bullets. The purpose of the French proposal is to resist the means used by the majority of countries in the committee who do not support the restriction of national defense budgets and do not advocate for the supervision of the manufacture of armaments, and who strive to quickly conclude a convention, hoping to disregard these issues.

<h3>Four-Power Pact Negotiations Take a Sudden Turn for the Better</h3>
<p>Signing Expected in Geneva</p>
<p>(Paris) Messages from London, Rome, and Geneva received by the Morning Post today stated that the Four-Power Pact is on the verge of being concluded and that the signing is expected to take place this week. The reason for this rapid conclusion is that Britain has agreed to incorporate Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant concerning sanctions into the pact. The Little Entente countries have also accepted French Foreign Minister Peng Gu's promise to conclude a separate treaty guaranteeing the security of the smaller countries, thereby abandoning their initial protests.

<h3>National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held its weekly memorial ceremony on the morning of the 29th. Attending were Ye Chucang, Wei Huai, Lu Chao, Tang Shengzhi, He Yaozu, Chen Qicai, Li Yuanding, Zhang Daofan, Zhou Yawei, and over 300 civil and military officials. Chairman Ye Chucang presided over the ceremony and gave a report, emphasizing "frugality to save the nation." He stated that in this time of national crisis, we should dedicate all that we have to the nation to meet its needs. Colleagues in the National Government recently formed a Frugality to Save the Nation Association, with this intention in mind. However, the association has an even more important purpose, which is to practice the word "frugality." Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings have eight virtues: loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, peace. These eight virtues are concrete in times of national crisis. While military affairs, finance, and diplomacy are all important, the concrete foundation is still frugality. Therefore, to achieve the eight virtues of loyalty, filial piety, etc., one must start with practicing frugality. Achieving the eight virtues is not easy, but practicing frugality only requires determination. Those who are thrifty are certainly diligent. Those who are thrifty and diligent can certainly be loyal to the country, can be without contention with others, and can be sincerely united with everyone. Therefore, only frugality can save the nation. (29th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Central Party Headquarters Memorial Week</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Party Headquarters held its 80th Memorial Week on the morning of the 29th at 8:00 AM. Attending were Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Wu Jingheng, Chen Lifu, Li Ciwen, Huang Jichen, Wang Luyi, Wang Faquan, Hong Ludong, Ke Xing'e, and approximately 600 staff members. Wu Jingheng presided over the ceremony, led the attendees in paying their respects, and gave a general report, stating that Japan has always been able to exploit all the weaknesses of other countries to carry out its extreme imperialist aggression. Because our country has many weaknesses, its ability to cope with the environment is insufficient, and it is bullied everywhere. The cessation of military action in the north is really just a temporary respite and should not be taken to mean that there will be no more trouble. We must seek fundamental ways to become strong. Others say that we have no organization, but in fact, our organization is complete. It is only that the people have no ideology. Originally, mass belief in an ideology begins with compulsion. Besides unconditional absolute obedience and belief, there is no need for discussion or hesitation. This principle holds true in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Our country should still take the spirit of the previous Kuomintang and require the whole country to respect and absolutely believe in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Because Dr. Sun Yat-sen created the Republic of China, all people of the Republic should unconditionally believe in the claims of their founding father. When a nation has an ideology, it gains strength. What is there to fear about being unable to save the nation? After finishing his speech, the meeting was adjourned. (29th, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Gandhi Ends Fasting</h3>
<p>Weak Vitality, Doctors Advise Urgent Rest</p>
<p>Crowds Celebrate Enthusiastically, Offer Food</p>
<p>National Daily, Poona, 29th: After the end of his fasting period today, Gandhi initially ingested two ounces of orange juice, and then rested peacefully. His physical condition did not seem to be as weak as the doctors had predicted. His fasting period expired at 12:15 PM today. At that time, Gandhi was lying on a small bed, covered with a white sheet, his eyes still shining, but his body was thinner than after his last fast, almost skin and bones. As he drank the orange juice, the doctors attended by his side. Gandhi then thanked the doctors for their attentive care during the fasting period, and said that he would rest quietly. As for the results of this fast, there are no comments from his friends yet.</p>
<p>Havas, Bombay, India, 29th: Gandhi's followers in Poona gathered in groups in a beautiful building on a small hill to celebrate the end of Gandhi's fasting. The crowds demonstrated enthusiastically, sang songs, and set off fireworks, using them to announce the news of Gandhi's end of fasting to residents throughout the city. Today is Gandhi's day of silence. Gandhi first performed silent prayer, then drank a cup of orange water offered by the untouchable caste. Villagers from distant places came one after another, competing to offer various items, especially honey, fresh fruit, and lotus flowers, to Gandhi. Gandhi then handwrote a declaration, instructing someone to read it to the public, saying that if God allowed him to fast and still maintain his life, it was because God still needed him to engage in other undertakings. Mrs. Gandhi then planted a mango tree in a flower bed near the small hill building, so as to leave a memorial for the end of Gandhi's fasting. The whole city is like on a holiday today. Gandhi's followers will hold a meeting in the afternoon to recite prayers of gratitude to God. The expert doctors treating Gandhi said that Gandhi now needs absolute rest.</p>
<h3>US Treasury Secretary Morgan Case Intends to Resign</h3>
<p>Backdoor Deals Give Opposition Party an Opening</p>
<p>President Invites Woodin for a River Cruise</p>
<p>To Discuss Solutions</p>
<p>Washington, 28th (Special Dispatch) - Friends of the US President claim that Treasury Secretary Woodin has told the President that if the President believes his remaining in office would embarrass the government, he would resign. However, the President has not yet decided whether to ask Woodin to resign. When Woodin was asked about this matter, he only replied that one should ask the President, adding that he has not yet resigned.</p>
<p>Washington, 28th (Special Dispatch) - Today, the US President invited Treasury Secretary Woodin for a cruise on the Potomac River. It is reported that the decision on whether Woodin will remain in office will be made before they return to Washington. Government officials indicate that the President felt uneasy after learning about the details of the Morgan Bank case, discovering that Treasury Secretary Woodin was also among those receiving special treatment from Morgan. Therefore, he specifically invited Woodin on the cruise to discuss solutions face-to-face. It is said that since the Senate Banking Committee discovered that Woodin had engaged in "backdoor deals" with Morgan, purchasing stocks at prices far below market value and reselling them for profit, Republican senators have been demanding his resignation. Although the calls for resignation have subsided slightly in the past two days, it is rumored that Democratic leaders in the Senate have agreed to take action to rectify the situation. However, those close to the President mostly deny these claims, some suggesting that the President and the Treasury Secretary will discuss stabilizing the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar. Others claim that Woodin does not fully agree with the President's financial plans, a hint of which was revealed when the President implemented the gold embargo a few days ago. In any case, regardless of what is discussed on the President's yacht, the Republican Party is determined to seize the opportunity to embarrass the opposition. Today, Republican senators issued a declaration demanding the dismissal of US Ambassador to Europe, Davis, stating that it is shocking that the President has not immediately dismissed Davis after uncovering the inside story. They also claimed that they would propose a detailed investigation in the House of Representatives on Monday into Davis's relationship with international bankers since he learned about international affairs in 1917. Davis previously served as Acting Secretary of State under President Wilson and was later appointed to the Financial Committee in Europe in 1919. He also served as a member of the Supreme Economic Council and the Reparations Commission. However, according to a claim, Davis still served as a trustee of a New York bank for most of this time.</p>

<h3>Danzig General Election Results: Nazi Party Wins Big</h3>
<p>Anti-Polish Policy Expected to End</p>
<p>Reuters, Danzig, 28th - The Nazi Party has won a major victory in the Danzig general election, securing 38 out of 72 seats. In other words, they won 107,619 votes out of 215,132, three times more than in 1930. The Social Democratic Party received 38,210 votes, the Center Party received 31,504 votes, the Communist Party received 14,800 votes, and others received 13,601 votes. Furthermore, the final results of the Danzig election are as follows: Nazi Party 38 seats, Social Democratic Party 13 seats, Center Party 10 seats, Communist Party 3 seats, Government Party 4 seats, Polish Party 3 seats. The Nazi Party gained 25 more seats than before. The election has passed without any disturbances.</p>
<p>Havas, Danzig, 29th - Now that the Nazi Party has gained power in Danzig, its actions will be closely linked to Berlin. Therefore, the future relationship between Danzig and Poland has become a problem. Some point out that Hitler has made declarations of peace, and the Polish government has also guaranteed to maintain order. Additionally, Nazi Party leader Koch has agreed to leave Danzig to avoid demonstrations, which may signal a possible easing of tensions. Polish individuals are optimistic about the failure of the National Rights Party, as it constantly opposed Poland during the election campaign. Since 1930, the Danzig Senate's policies have been anti-Polish, which has caused some disturbances. With the Nazi Party's victory, this anti-Polish policy may come to an end. The Nazi Party is well aware of the necessity of cooperation with Poland, and its published party platform does not include any attacks on Warsaw. This has reassured most residents of Danzig.</p>

<h3>Tension in Chahar -</h3>
<p>Feng Yuxiang Becomes Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Army</p>
<p>Obstacles on the PingSui Railway</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping - The Japanese army is determined to seize Chahar in order to complete its so-called Manchuria-Mongolia policy, controlling China from the south and resisting Soviet Russia from the north. After the situation in Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin) eased, the defense of Chahar Province became tense. Lieutenant General Isoya, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, stated that taking Zhangjiakou is necessary to ensure the security of the Manchurian border. Military headquarters also intend to retreat to the Great Wall for future plans in the west. Recently, although the first step of the local peace negotiations within the Great Wall has been agreed upon, and the second step of resolving diplomatic issues is underway, the Japanese army has temporarily suspended the advance of troops entering the pass during this period and shifted its attention to Chahar, beginning preparations for aggression. After the traitorous troops of Liu Guitang and Cui Xingwu occupied Dolun, the Japanese army supervised their actions while transporting large quantities of military supplies to Dolun in preparation for invading Chahar. Liu and his men repeatedly telegraphed the support associations and the troops stationed in Chahar Province, stating that there was nothing unusual, but they claimed that Japanese cavalry were monitoring them and that they could not act freely until the opportune moment. As for the Chahar volunteer army and various miscellaneous troops, their organization is complex, they are not under unified command, and they lack both pay and equipment, making their combat effectiveness weak. Unless methods are devised to prepare them as soon as possible, the defense of Chahar Province is precarious. Feng Yuxiang has been living in Zhangjiakou for a long time and advocates thorough resistance against Japan. He has been in contact with various parties for two months. Since Fang Zhenwu's troops arrived in Chahar Province, he has become even more active. Yesterday (the 26th), he assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army in Zhangjiakou. Sun Dianying and Fang Zhenwu have joined forces with him, each serving as a commander. Feng originally had a guard of several hundred men in Zhangjiakou. Recently, he recruited new soldiers and reorganized a part of the volunteer army. Since retreating from Rehe, Sun Dianying's troops have been stationed in the Chicheng area, with approximately 30,000 soldiers. Fang Zhenwu has combined his old troops, the Bao Gang and Zhang Renjie armies, and stationed them in the Xuanhua area. A few days ago, he suddenly disarmed He Sui's 2,000 troops, seized their weapons, and replenished his forces, making preparations. He now has about 20,000 soldiers. Tang Yulin's troops have automatically entered the Rehe territory, and Tang's whereabouts are unknown. The situation of Feng Zhanhai's volunteer army in the Kangbao area is also unclear. After Feng Yuxiang assumed office in Zhangjiakou, a lengthy telegraph of over 600 words was sent to Beiping today (the 27th), stating the reasons for assuming office. The main points of the telegram roughly stated, "I, as the Commander-in-Chief of the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army, lead like-minded soldiers and civilians to form a front, armed to resist Japan and defend Chahar Province. All who genuinely resist Japan are friends of the nation and therefore my friends. All who do not resist Japan or falsely resist Japan are enemies of the nation and therefore my enemies." After Feng's telegram arrived in Beiping, it attracted considerable attention from all parties. Yesterday (the 26th) afternoon, the PingSui Railway experienced obstacles in the Xuanhua area, and traffic was temporarily interrupted. The Ping-Zhang telegrams were also blocked. Today (the 27th) at 7:00 a.m., it was fully restored. The PingSui Railway Bureau plans to establish a branch office in Datong. Duan Zonglin, the deputy director of the railway, has gone to Datong today to prepare everything. Based on the current situation, the situation in Chahar is becoming increasingly tense. If the Japanese and puppet troops invade the west, Feng and others will definitely fight to the death. Although the outcome is difficult to predict, the situation is worthy of attention.

<h3>He Chengjun Departs for Western Hubei to Inspect</h3>
<p>Detailed Discussions with Xu Yuanquan on Plans to Suppress He Long's Bandits</p>
<p>Bandits in Eastern Hubei Fled to Southern Henan, No More Bandit Traces</p>
<p>Correspondence from Hankou - He Long's bandit gang, trapped in western Hubei, knowing that holding out was not a viable plan, sent out members to flee in all directions, attempting to find a way out. Apart from once fleeing to eastern Sichuan, they twice fled to western Hunan and central Hubei, but were always blocked by the strict defenses of the National Army, and eventually had to retreat back to Wufeng in a sorry state, having lost more than half of their strength. Recently, it was heard that Xu Xiangqian's bandit gang was causing trouble in northern Sichuan again, becoming active. Xu's bandits previously fled to Sichuan to provide remote support to He Long's bandits, forming a mutual defense. When Xu first entered Sichuan, he took advantage of the exploitation by warlords to incite the masses, which was very effective. Therefore, they were very active. However, Tian Songyao, concerned about his survival, worked hard to suppress them. Xu's bandits suffered repeated defeats, and hearing that the Liu-Deng war was imminent, they did not want to stay in Sichuan and prompt the Sichuan warlords to unite. Thus, they completely abandoned Bazhong, Nanjiang, and Tongjiang, and retreated to the Shaanxi border to show that they had no intention of re-entering Sichuan. In reality, they were still waiting for an opportunity. Not long after Xu's bandits left Sichuan, the Liu-Deng war unfortunately broke out. Tian only left two divisions to defend northern Sichuan, and the rest were sent back to participate in the civil war, leaving the defenses of Tongnan empty. At this time, Xu's main force had approached Hanzhong and, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched a force back to northern Sichuan, arriving at Kushuba in Tongjiang County. They made contact with Tian Songyao's troops, and it was said that Tian's troops suffered some losses. Initially, they were guests on foreign soil, but now they were outnumbered. He Long's bandits, seeing that Xu's bandits had re-entered Sichuan, thought they would strike to provide support and planned to break out with all their strength. Their destination is still unknown, but they were likely to flee to Sichuan and form a pincer movement with Xu's bandits. He Chengjun, the Pacification Director stationed in Hubei, was ordered by Chiang Kai-shek to reside in Hankou and was responsible for overseeing the suppression of bandits in Sichuan and Hubei. Seeing that He Long's bandits were in dire straits, he planned to eradicate them in one fell swoop. To understand the bandit situation and discuss plans to suppress them with Xu Yuanquan, he took a mail plane on the 27th, braving the rain to inspect Shashi. When they reached Yuekou, the wind and rain intensified, and heavy clouds prevented them from continuing. They turned back to Hankou and rescheduled their departure for the 28th or 29th. Xu Yuanquan will issue a general suppression order as soon as He arrives in Shashi. It should not be difficult to eliminate this bandit force. The only concern is Xu's bandits on the Sichuan border. Kuang's bandits in eastern Hubei are still on the border between Henan and Hubei, and there have been no major movements recently. However, a faction from Yinghuo has split and fled through the east-west boundary ridge to the eastern countryside of Lihuang County in southern Henan. Wei Lihuang and Chen Jicheng are preparing to suppress them. Kong's bandits in southern Hubei were previously defeated by the Hunan army and fled back to the Jiangxi border. The remnants fled to the vicinity of Jinniu. According to a telegram from the commander of the 82nd Division, Rong Jingfang, they have been completely annihilated by that unit. Currently, He Jian, the commander of the western route, is launching a large-scale general offensive against this bandit force, making it difficult for them to cause trouble on the Hubei border again. Looking at the areas plagued by bandit disturbances, apart from Xu's bandits, He Long, Kuang Jixun, and Kong Hechong's three bandit forces are all within Hubei Province. Therefore, Hubei has suffered more than other provinces. The Hubei Provincial Party Headquarters specifically sent letters on the 26th to the command headquarters for suppressing bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and the provincial government, requesting them to devise methods to eliminate them and secure the local area to eliminate hidden dangers. The letter stated, "The 103rd meeting of this committee passed a temporary motion to investigate the communist bandits in this province. Apart from the central Hubei area, which has been cleared, other areas have recently seen the resurgence of communist activity, and there is a risk of revival. It is proposed that this committee send letters to the command headquarters, the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and the provincial government, requesting them to devise methods to suppress them and eliminate the root cause to prevent them from spreading. It was also decided that the major bandit forces in this province were previously suppressed by Commander-in-Chief Chiang during his visit to Hubei, and they have been repeatedly routed. Only remnants remain, and the responsibility for clearing them has been assigned to various armies. We thought that these insignificant bandits would soon be completely annihilated. Unexpectedly, recent reports indicate that the remaining bandits in various counties have continued to grow. If we do not suppress them in advance, the hidden dangers will be profound. We are sending this letter to you, requesting you to devise methods to eliminate them and secure the local area." The Department of Civil Affairs and the Relief Committee, recognizing that the bandit disasters in western Hubei, northern Hubei, and eastern Hubei are the most severe, decided to allocate 77,000 yuan to provide emergency relief to the victims. On the 27th, Xie Shubin was appointed as the relief commissioner for Jun, Yun, and Yunxi counties, Dai Lizhen was appointed as the relief commissioner for the border area between Huang and Ma counties, Wang Hu was appointed as the relief commissioner for Fangxian, Baokang, and Yiju counties, and Chen Yichen was appointed as the relief commissioner for Xingshan, Badong, and Wufeng counties. They departed with the funds that day. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is better than nothing. (May 27th)</p>
<h3>Shanxi and Suiyuan Armies Participate in the Anti-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Fu Zuoyi's Troops Initially Stationed in Zhangjiakou</p>
<p>Now Ordered to Advance to Shunyi</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence - The Shanxi and Suiyuan armies participating in the anti-Japanese war include one division directly under Fu Zuoyi, one division under Li Fuyong, and Zhao Chengshou's entire cavalry force. In addition, there is a portion of Zhou Dai's artillery force. Fu's troops are moving from Suiyuan, Zhao's troops are departing from Datong, and Li's division and Zhou's artillery are departing from Taiyuan. Zhao's troops were initially deployed to Dolun, while Fu and Li's troops were expected to be stationed in the Zhangjiakou area to defend the eastern Chahar line. Fu's troops have now been ordered to advance to Shunyi, while Li's division will remain in Zhangjiakou to maintain order. Fu's troops are currently resisting fiercely at the front lines. Yan Xishan has been receiving telegrams from Fu for days, and in addition to sending telegrams of commendation and providing strategic guidance, he has specially dispatched Bo Guitang, director of the Suiyuan Military Medical Department, with 5,000 yuan in cash to represent his appreciation. After receiving the order, Bo departed this afternoon on the Zhengtai Railway via Beiping to the north. Furthermore, the Taiyuan Women's National Salvation Association, recognizing Fu's troops' valiant fighting, has appointed Zhao Peilan, Yang Banghuan, Song Guanghua, Zhang Ciqin, Cao Yayi, and other five people as representatives to bring a large number of慰劳items to the troops tomorrow morning to boost morale. Recently, because Beiping and Tianjin have been harassed by enemy aircraft, refugees have been flocking to Taiyuan for days, and the inns are almost full. Northeastern University had previously announced its relocation to Taiyuan, and the local Public Security Bureau has found many houses for them to stay. However, as of tonight, they have not yet arrived in Taiyuan, presumably because the situation in Beiping has eased and they have canceled their trip. Furthermore, the authorities, recognizing that the enemy is advancing and the situation in Chahar is critical, have transferred Sun Chu's Ma Yanshou brigade of the Zhengtai Railway Protection Army to Datong to strengthen the border defense. Sun and Ma went to inspect everything yesterday. (May 25th)</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Guangxi Reclamation and Water Conservancy Pilot Zone</h3>
<p>Correspondence from Guangxi - Recently, the call for rural reconstruction has been growing louder, and the government has even established a Rural Reconstruction Committee, demonstrating the importance that the people of the country attach to this matter. However, opinions vary on how to achieve reconstruction and where to start. Most people advocate starting with relief efforts, such as improving agricultural production, providing low-interest loans, developing water conservancy, and promoting rural education. The recent resolutions of the Rural Reconstruction Committee reflect these ideas. The Shandong Rural Construction Research Institute in Zouping County, Shandong, also promotes these same goals, such as revitalizing agriculture and improving rural areas. Relief for rural construction and Zouping Village is now recognized by most people in the country as the only way to revive the countryside. Regardless of its future effectiveness, we must recognize it as a powerful theory today. Therefore, we must pay attention to and study any rural projects that are based on this theory and put into practice. I am currently residing in Guangxi and heard that there is a Guangxi Reclamation and Water Conservancy Pilot Zone located between Liuzhou and Liucheng in Guangxi. Recognizing it as a rare rural project in Guangxi Province, I made a special trip to visit it. I will now briefly describe my observations and report them to the people of the country as a reference for those who are concerned about rural issues today.</p>
<h3>(1) Overview of the Guangxi Reclamation and Water Conservancy Pilot Zone</h3>
<p>The pilot zone is located in central Guangxi, between Liuzhou and the Shapudongquan Shidong area in Liucheng. It covers an area of approximately 2,000 square li, extending over 100 li from Liuzhou to the north of Shapu in the north-south direction and 90 li from Liucheng to the east of Dongquan and Shidong in the east-west direction. The total area of the zone is in the shape of a rhombus. The headquarters is located in Shatang, 35 li south of Liuzhou County, and can be reached directly by car. The director of the zone is Wu Tingyang, the former Director of Construction of Guangxi. The Guangxi Provincial Government allocates 100,000 silver dollars (approximately equivalent to 70,000 Shanghai dollars) each year to fund the zone. The total population of the zone is approximately 75,000, distributed in 156 villages. Among them, those who migrated from Hunan account for 40%, those who came from Guangdong and Wuzhou account for 30%, and the rest are Zhuang people, natives of the Liuzhou and Guilin areas similar to the Yao people. This area was once occupied by Shen Hongying, and Lu Rongting also resided here. Due to years of war and numerous bandits, the local economy is extremely depleted, and the population density varies. Apart from the area near Dongquan, where the population is relatively dense, the rest of the zone is a vast wilderness with a very sparse population. A simple map is attached below.</p>
<h3>(2) Development Process</h3>
<p>The zone was originally part of the Liujiang Forestry and Reclamation Office. However, after five or six years of operation, it had no development due to various reasons. In March of the 21st year, it was reorganized into the Guangxi Reclamation and Water Conservancy Pilot Zone, operating independently. Therefore, the zone has only been operating for one year. However, due to careful planning and diligent implementation, the achievements in the past year have been quite remarkable. When I was in Liuzhou, I met Mr. Lie Ganzhi, who was sent to China by Harvard University in the United States to study insects. He said that he had traveled all over China for more than two years and had seen countless villages. Among the rural projects he had seen, only Beibei in Baxian County, Sichuan, and this zone were worthy of attention. He highly praised this.</p>
<h3>(3) Zone Administration Policy</h3>
<p>The zone's administrative policy can be summarized as transforming the old rural areas and building new rural areas. The zone believes that due to environmental constraints, the first step is to increase production so that farmers have considerable economic power. Only then can the zone demand rural self-governance from the farmers. The zone believes that the first thing to do is to ensure that every farmer has enough to eat. This is an inviolable principle. After every farmer has enough to eat, the second step is to ask how to make farmers eat better and live more comfortably. At the same time, the zone believes that everyone should have enough to eat, not just a few. Furthermore, those who work with their minds should not be able to eat well and live comfortably while those who work with their hands should eat poorly and live uncomfortably. Therefore, its consistent advocacy lies in "the tillers owning their land," realizing an equal society and eliminating the gap between the rich and the poor. The name "Reclamation and Water Conservancy Pilot Zone" is actually inconsistent with the zone's objectives. However, to avoid social misunderstanding, this name was used. In fact, the zone's purpose is not limited to reclamation.</p>
<h3>(4) Operational Steps</h3>
<p>The operational steps for the area will be carried out in two phases. The first phase will focus on improving rural economic organizations and implementing land reclamation policies. In addition to continuing the projects from the previous phase, the second phase will focus on various social and political facilities. These are described in detail below:</p>
<p>(A) Improvement of Economic Organizations: This is the first step into rural areas, and it will be carried out through three types of projects:</p>
<p>(1) Establishing Lending Offices: The nature of the lending offices is equivalent to that of credit cooperatives, but their content is even more comprehensive than the credit cooperatives commonly seen. First, the lending office will directly handle loans to farmers without involving village chiefs or district heads. Second, the collateral is not based on tangible assets such as farmland and houses, but on the farmer's daily creditworthiness and diligence. Third, the loans are borrowed by the area from the Guangxi Bank. The Guangxi Bank charges 1% interest, and the area also charges 1% interest when re-lending to farmers, without adding any handling fees, etc. It is entirely voluntary, so the lending office can truly serve the farmers, unlike ordinary cooperatives. The reporter asked the person in charge of the office why they did not directly use the name of "credit cooperative." The response was, "We are not yet sure whether the business we are currently running can truly meet the spirit of a credit cooperative. If it reaches a certain stage and a definite name is needed, we can hang a sign at the door that says 'Guangxi Liucheng County Tianzi No. 1 Shatang Credit Cooperative' so that the name matches the reality." Although the words were humorous, they were also said with sincerity. We looked at each other and laughed.</p>
<p>(2) Trial Operation of Warehouses: The most painful thing for farmers is the high interest rates charged by landlords in rural areas. This is the case in all countries. In the rural areas of Liuzhou, Guangxi, interest rates can be as high as three times the principal per year. If farmers do not have sufficient savings during lean seasons, they often resort to drinking poison to quench their thirst, willingly accepting the oppression of high interest rates without resistance. When the new grain is harvested, grain merchants manipulate and monopolize the market, deliberately suppressing prices. Farmers have no choice but to sell the grain they produced at a high cost at a low price. In addition, there are many internal customs checkpoints, making exchange difficult. In famine years, they cannot purchase grain from other places for relief, and in bumper years, they cannot sell surplus grain to places with poor harvests, resulting in falling grain prices and harming farmers. In short, whether in famine or bumper years, farmers only have one path: bankruptcy. After several years of such cycles, the average farmer is bled dry, and even self-sufficient small farmers are declining. This is the general situation in China today, and Guangxi is no exception. In view of this, the area has created a warehouse to store grain for farmers. In bumper years, it stores the surplus grain of farmers to maintain market prices, and in famine years, it distributes it to provide relief. It can also be used to provide grain during lean seasons. Its nature is different from ordinary granaries, and it is actually similar to the godowns in Shanghai. Its sole purpose is to store the surplus grain of farmers, regulate the people's food supply, and stabilize grain prices. This warehouse is closely linked to the lending office, and the method is excellent and the intention is beautiful.</p>
<p>(3) Establishing Public Stores: These public stores are quite similar to consumer cooperatives and purchasing cooperatives, but they are different from ordinary consumer cooperatives. They purchase goods based on demand. When a certain item is needed, they purchase it wholesale from other places. They have mutual contact with merchants in other ports and operate chain cooperative businesses.</p>
<p>Of the above three projects, the area will start with the first one. After the first one has been successfully implemented, the second and third will be carried out in succession. The area believes that the first step in running rural affairs should be to make the economy work and to make farmers trust the area. Only then can farmers unite and be led. These three projects are precisely the means to deeply penetrate the rural areas and establish a close relationship with the farmers. It is necessary to ensure that these three projects are well-managed before other projects can be carried out.</p>
<p>(B) Implementing Land Reclamation Policies: This is a plan for further building new rural areas. The barren land in the area is divided into three types: 1. Paddy fields, 2. Highlands, 3. Mountain land. The land reclamation methods are also divided into three items that are carried out simultaneously, which are described in detail below:</p>
<p>(1) Central Farm: This involves setting aside a small portion of land for experimentation, accounting for 300 mu in the entire area, in addition to orchards and garden areas. This experimental area can initially be freely cultivated by the settlers, but next to the settlers' cultivated area, there must be an area cultivated using scientific methods to demonstrate comparison and inspire farmers' confidence in improving farming.</p>
<p>(2) Economic Farm: This is a large-scale land reclamation farm, each occupying more than 10,000 mu of land and using machinery for cultivation.</p>
<p>(3) Cooperative Farm: This is developed by private individuals who pool their shares and receive guidance from the area.</p>
<p>The area stipulates that after the above-mentioned land is cultivated by the settlers, the land will be distributed to the settlers. Farming tools and livestock will be lent to the settlers at a discounted price, and the settlers will repay the discounted price to the investors in ten years. Half of the forest timber will be given to the settlers, and half will be given to the investors. The forest land will be completely owned by the settlers. At this point, the implementation of the new village can be declared complete.</p>
<p>The above is the work to be carried out in the first phase. After the first phase of work is completed, the work of social facilities will be proceeded with.</p>
<p>(Inner) Experimental School: This is the work of the second phase, scheduled to open in two years. Its purpose is to use the school as a starting point for social and political facilities, train general rural children, improve the general knowledge level of farmers, and promote the independence and autonomy of farmers.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Communist Suppression Army Mobilizes</h3>
<p>Eastern River troops successively advance towards Jiangxi</p>
<p>Southern Route Headquarters for Suppressing Bandits in Five Provinces Organized</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Since Chen Jitang resolved to become the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route for Suppressing Bandits in the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, he has been actively preparing to send troops into Jiangxi to implement the second phase of the bandit suppression plan. The troop deployments are becoming increasingly active. The 1st Independent Division and the 7th and 8th Divisions of the 3rd Army in the Eastern River area have been mobilized successively. It is estimated that the two regiments of Zhong Shaokui's brigade under the 1st Independent Division and Wu Hanping's regiment stationed in Pingyuan have arrived in Dongshi, Guangdong. Ye Shiyao's regiment under Huang Zhiwen's unit of the 8th Division of the 3rd Army has moved from Xunwu to Xunbei. Xie Zheng's regiment stationed in Liuche has advanced to Xunwu, and Ouyang Xin's regiment stationed in Beiling has moved into Liuche on the Jiangxi border. Chen Feng's regiment, originally stationed in Xingning, has also been ordered to depart. The 19th and 20th regiments of Huang Yanzhen's unit of the 7th Division and Deng Hui's training regiment have also received clear orders to concentrate in Meixian and Pingyuan to prepare to enter Jiangxi. The military expenses have been discussed and finalized with the military authorities in the province by the Chief of Staff of the army, Zhou Zhi. Zhou returned to Chaozhou and Shantou yesterday to deploy everything. The labor force has been allocated by the Transportation Corps Captain to 1,700 people for distribution to various divisions. The second transportation station has been moved from Shantou to Meixian. In the future, the defenses of Chaozhou and Shantou will be taken over by Zhang Duangui's unit of the 2nd Independent Division. The defenses of Xingning will be taken over by troops sent by the 5th Division. It has been learned that the Guangdong army in the Eastern River area is focusing on the Xunwu line in eastern Jiangxi. After the Xunwu troops advance, Zhang Meixin's unit of the 4th Division in Sannan and Wang Zanbin's division of the Guangxi army will advance towards Anyuan and other places. The 1st and 2nd Divisions and the 3rd Independent Division of the 1st Army in northern Guangdong and Jiangxi will also advance towards Xingguo at the same time, with Chen Zhang's 2nd Independent Brigade remaining in the rear as a reserve force. The 3rd Independent Division stationed in Shaozhou has been ordered to begin transporting troops to Nanxiong yesterday. At the same time, more than a dozen long-distance buses have been chartered and handed over to the Nan-Shao Highway Administration for transporting military supplies. Since the Guangdong Province Communist Suppression Army has advanced on the northeast roads, it is rumored that the two-column system will be restored, with Yu Hanmou and Xiang Hanping serving as the commanders of the first and second columns, directly under the Command Headquarters of the Five Provinces Southern Route Communist Suppression. The Fifth Provinces Anti-Bandit General Headquarters is also actively being organized, and in addition to establishing one director, it is divided into staff office, military supply office, adjutant office, military law office, and political training office. The director of the executive camp may be held concurrently by Yu Hanmou, and the candidates for the heads of the various offices have also been largely determined. (24th)</p>
<h3>Sujia Highway Nearing Completion</h3>
<p>Road Surface Being Prepared, Expected to Open to Traffic in June</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The Sujia Highway in Jiangsu Province runs from Wuxian, passing through Wujiang, Beitan, Pingwang, Wangjiangjing, etc., to Jiaxing, Zhejiang. It is extremely important for transportation and transportation relations between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The road is 77.7 kilometers long. The roadbed was started in 1929, but due to funding problems, there were delays. In addition, the Shanghai War broke out suddenly last year, and part of the road project was bombed and destroyed by Japanese aircraft. Later, when Finance Minister Song Ziwen convened a highway conference in Beijing for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, Song and others believed that this road was important and should be completed as soon as possible. According to the opinion of the National Economic Council, the original route was too remote, so the route plan was overturned, and the route below Pingwang was changed, running from Pingwang through Duanshi, Shengze, Wangjiangjing to Jiaxing. The Jiangsu Construction Department ordered the heads of the construction bureaus of Wuxian and Wujiang to remeasure, prepare a new plan and budget for approval, and then ordered them to be responsible for the project. At the same time, the Sujia Road Engineering Office was established to supervise the entire project. The road includes 48 bridges, culverts, and earthwork projects, which require time and money. The Jiangsu Construction Department originally planned to complete the entire project in March of this year, but after repeated requests for postponement from the construction bureaus of Wuxian and other places, it has recently been reported that the road bridges, culverts, and other works have been completed, and the road surface is currently being prepared. The provincial government has recently ordered to speed up the preparation, and to open the road to traffic no later than June 18. (29th)</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Another Problem Arises with the Sheng Family Inheritance</p>
<p>The Sheng Ansun property in Suzhou, such as the famous Liuyuan Garden, was previously ordered by the county government to be returned. It was fully handed over to the descendants of the Sheng family on the 18th of this month. Now the county government has suddenly received an order from the province to temporarily suspend the return. County Magistrate Zou ordered the former Sheng Property Management Office and the Public Security Bureau to go to recover it yesterday (29th). It is also heard that the Sheng property in Jiangyin has also been repossessed by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Appeal in the Shazhou Rape and Murder Case</p>
<p>Jiang Wangshi, the wife of Jiang Qinsheng in Yanhong Township, Shazhou City, Fourth District, had an affair with Yu San, who lived nearby. Jiang discovered the affair and caught them in the act once. Yu and Wang then harbored resentment. On November 15 of last year, they strangled Qinsheng with a rope and buried the body in a mud pit. The case was initially solved this month, and Yu and Wang were arrested and detained. After repeated trials, the county magistrate sentenced Yu San and Jiang Wangshi to death for jointly plotting murder. Yu San refused to accept the county verdict and hired lawyer Xi Dehe to write an appeal.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Bandits Continuously Rob and Injure People</p>
<p>The Xunqiaotou area of Yishiyitu, Sixth District, is only two li away from the city and has convenient land and water transportation. There are three brothers, Xu Ronghua, Rongchun, and Rongkui, who are villagers there and jointly run a boat from Jiangyin Tianzhuang to Wuxi. The night before, the boat sailed from Tianzhuang to Wuxi. At around 2:00 am, when the boat passed the Xieqian Toubankou in Changjing Township, Cheng County, a bandit boat suddenly appeared. Eight or nine bandits jumped out, wearing red cloths on their heads and holding four box cannons, shouting to stop the boat. They swarmed aboard and wantonly looted, taking away goods and silver dollars worth about 300 yuan. They also stabbed the passengers with sharp blades, and Xu Ronghua was also injured by wooden objects. Afterwards, Xu Ronghua and others still sailed the boat to Wuxi and anchored. The next day, the three brothers, Xu Ronghua, etc., walked home. Unexpectedly, eight bandits came to the Xu family that night, forbidding them to make any noise, and wantonly searched and looted, causing a loss of more than 200 yuan. Ronghua and Rongkui were both shot by the bandits with pistols. After obtaining the loot, the bandits fled towards the railway from the Beizhakou area.</p>
<h3>Tan Hongxi to Visit Wuxi Today</h3>
<p>After a period of extreme fatigue, the local silk cocoon industry may be on the road to recovery due to the good cocoon season this year. The silkworms in the four villages have mostly ascended to the clusters. The Cocoon Industry Guild decided at a meeting on the 26th to open the cocoon weighing scale on June 1. Seventeen cocoon houses have reported to the guild that they will open. The silk factories that have been shut down in the local area are planning to resume operations. Tan Hongxi, the director of the Land Reclamation Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, will personally come to Wuxi today (30th) to understand the current situation of the local silk factories and the cocoon harvesting situation this year. He will convene a meeting with all the people in the silk and cocoon industry at the Qingye Guild to discuss everything.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Building Retreat Banks along the River to Defend Against Tides</p>
<p>The river embankment in the Langshan Port area of Nantong collapsed. Local people gathered to discuss relief measures and decided to build retreat banks inside the embankment to defend against the tides. The county government will requisition labor and start work within a month to complete the project.</p>
<p>Holding Infant Health Competition</p>
<p>The County Governance Folk Education Center initiated and held an infant health competition on the 28th. The venue was set up in the Chamber of Commerce Hall. More than 600 infants participated in the competition.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Discovery of Ancient Buddha in Boyun Temple</p>
<p>Boyun Temple, an ancient temple in Chenwuzhuang, Zhenjiang, is more than 2,000 years old. In the third year of Qianlong, the abbot of the temple went to Tibet to pay homage to the Buddha and request scriptures. The Living Buddha bestowed three ancient steel Buddhas from the Liang Dynasty, all less than a foot high and exquisitely carved. The monk brought them back and immediately covered them with red gold, costing nearly a thousand taels. He set up a shrine to enshrine them and assigned special personnel to guard them. During the Taiping Rebellion in the Tongzhi period, part of the temple was destroyed, and the Buddhas disappeared. Later, one was discovered and sold to a temple by a certain layman for a thousand taels. The other two have not been found. It is now heard that another one has been discovered in a certain place in the southern countryside. It was unearthed by a farmer and brought to Zhenjiang for sale. The gold has been eroded, and the ancient colors are mottled. A Mr. Zhang bought it for 200 yuan and plans to send it to a temple for preservation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Young Owner of Lumber Store Kidnapped</p>
<p>At 2:00 am on the (26th), five bandits suddenly came to the Ni Kunji Lumber Store outside Xuningmen in the city, holding two pistols, broke in, looted 10 silver dollars, and kidnapped the young owner of the store, Xiaolongzi, and escaped. The store has reported the case and requested the government to rescue the hostage.</p>
<p>Qingzhen Ferryboat Suspends Night Sailing</p>
<p>Since the water level in the Grand Canal has increased, the Qingzhen ferryboat has been able to travel smoothly. However, due to the rampant banditry between Mapengwan and Jieshou, each company has implemented a suspension of night sailing to avoid accidents and to be careful with travelers. All the ships sailing from Zhenjiang to Qing will spend the night in Shaobo, and the ships sailing from Qing to Zhenjiang will spend the night in Yangzhou for fear of danger in the Yangzi Bridge area.</p>
<p>Coal Worker Falls into the Water</p>
<p>The Guazhou Zhongxing Coal Company had a coal ship arrive the other day. A crane was used with rattan baskets to lift the coal ashore. A certain worker happened to be working beside the ship and was bumped into the water by the basket of coal. When he was rescued, he was already with the Water God. The worker's family has approached the company to ask for compensation.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Construction Department Sends Personnel</p>
<p>To Inspect and Accept Nanhui Project</p>
<p>Yu Wei, a technician from the Jiangsu Construction Department, was ordered to inspect the construction projects of Jia, Tai, Bao, Shang, Nan, Chuan, Feng, Qing, and Song counties. Yu arrived in Nanhui on the 26th, where he was received by County Magistrate Yuan Xiluo and Construction Director Ling Zhibin. They discussed the construction methods of county roads and telephone projects. On the 27th, he hired a special boat and was accompanied by Director Ling to inspect the dredging of the Wangjia Bang project in the county and instructed on the mud-digging method at Huangpu Estuary. That night, he stayed in Minhang. The next morning, he inspected and accepted the road surface project of the Pu-Bin section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. After arriving in Shanghai yesterday, he visited the city center and the new city government building. He took the 11:00 pm train back to the province.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Provincial School Inspector Comes to Cheng to Investigate Case</p>
<p>The Jigu Granary along the Hongqiao River in the city was applied for by the former School Superintendent Zhu Tinghua for educational use between 1915 and 1916 and approved. The Education Bureau moved in during 1928 and filed a report to the province for approval. Last year, the Department ordered the restoration of storage, and the Relief Institute disputed it, allocating the eastern houses for the use of the Jigu Granary. Unexpectedly, someone recently accused the Education Bureau to the provincial government of encroaching on the granary foundation. The provincial government ordered the Department of Education to handle it. Yesterday (27th), the Department of Education commissioned School Inspector Yi Zuolin to come to Cheng to jointly investigate the files with County Magistrate Ruan to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Cocoon Production Poor in Four Townships</p>
<p>The cocoon production season in the four townships of Jiaxing has largely come to an end. Fresh cocoons have already entered the market. According to a survey, only more than 20 cocoon houses have been opened in the county. The cocoon houses are very picky about the cocoons sold by the villagers. The local varieties are priced at 25-26 cents per catty at the top end, and the improved varieties are priced at 38-39 cents per catty at the top end. This year, due to the unfavorable weather, the cocoon harvest is exceptionally poor. In addition, the number of silkworm eggs raised is less than in previous years. Overall, the cocoon harvest is only 20-30%. The remaining leaves on the mulberry trees in the countryside are still eye-catching. The rural landscape can be seen here.</p>
<p>Riot of Road Construction Workers on Jiaping Road</p>
<p>The Jiaxing-Pinghu Highway has already been contracted out for construction in sections. However, the workers are all unreasonable, and nearby shops and villagers have been disturbed by them. The workers in the Dongzha section of the attached city strongly demanded yellow croaker. The patrol chief of the sub-station reported it to the County Public Security Bureau, which forwarded a letter to the General Engineering Office of the road to strictly restrain them. The workers found out about the incident. On the afternoon of the 28th, the workers invited Patrol Chief He Kuixiong to Bailian Temple to talk, but He ignored them. Unexpectedly, dozens of workers rushed to the police station and dragged Patrol Chief He to Bailian Temple, beating him severely along the way. The town's commercial office and the water police went to stop them, but the workers used the road construction tools to beat them indiscriminately, and also robbed the wooden-cased gun worn by the water police patrol chief Xiang. The town's shops closed one after another. When the County Public Security Bureau received the news, the vehicle patrol team and the patrol brigade went to arrest the troublemaking workers Yan Zhiwen, Wang Yisan, Shao Liping, Li Xiuchuan, Zhu Guangsheng, Zhang Ruping, Li Weilong, Jin Guangsheng, Wang Jinliang, Xu Weizhi and others. The rest scattered. It is not known how the road engineering office will deal with this.</p>

<h3>Aviation Association Did Not Send Personnel to Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association to Withdraw Funds</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that the Aviation Association Office, after reading Shenbao on May 27, contained the news that the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association had ordered fighter planes from the United Kingdom, specially sent clerk Zhang Yuliang to inquire about the actual situation. Unexpectedly, the next day, a news report said that the Aviation Association Office sent Zhang Yuliang to the association to withdraw aviation donations. The Aviation Association Office was sincerely afraid that the various circles would misunderstand, so it asked Zhang Yuliang to truthfully report and sent a letter to the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association for investigation. Zhang Yuliang's report was roughly the same as the letter to Lin Mianzhai (the letter to Lin has been seen in yesterday's newspaper). Lin Mianzhai replied that, "Mr. Yuliang, after reading your letter, I learned the truth. What was said in the conversation the other day was as stated in your letter.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Replies to Aviation Association</h3>
<p>Commending the Association for Raising Funds to Purchase Aircraft</p>
<p>After the Chinese Aviation Association resolved to raise funds to purchase aircraft, it immediately sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Now it has received a reply telegram from Chiang saying, "Mr. Shi Liangcai, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zhengting, Lin Kanghou, and Lin Wojiang, I have received your telegram and learned that your meeting resolved to purchase aircraft and collect donations, demonstrating your eagerness to save the country and your courage to sacrifice. I admire you endlessly. I hereby express my love. Chiang Kai-shek, Qianji"</p>
<h3>Lin Wojiang Talks about the Recent Work of the Aviation Association</h3>
<p>Eighteen Fighter Jets Are Being Shipped to Shanghai One After Another</p>
<p>All Organizations' Fundraising for Aircraft Purchases Should Be Unified</p>
<p>Flying Club Can Be Established in January or February</p>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association has ordered 18 Eagle brand fighter jets from the Curtiss Company in the United States. The first aircraft has been shipped to Shanghai a few days ago. The Aviation Association has scheduled to hold the naming ceremony of the Shanghai City No. 1 aircraft at Longhua Airport on June 1, and invited all sectors to participate. At that time, Colonel Du Lide, a famous American aviator, will fly the aircraft and give a public demonstration. A reporter from this newspaper interviewed Mr. Lin Wojiang, Executive Director and Secretary-General of the Aviation Association, yesterday. According to his talk, the Eagle brand fighter jet is the latest product of the United States. It has the highest speed and is extremely convenient for ascending and descending. The head is equipped with machine guns, and bombs can be placed under the ends of the two wings. It can be used as a fighter jet or a bomber, so the Aviation Association, in accordance with the intentions of the Aviation Administration, decided to order 18 aircraft and organize them into a team. The first aircraft has been shipped, and the second batch will be shipped to Shanghai in the next few weeks. As for the donations raised by the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association and other organizations, it is best to concentrate them. It is hoped that the aircraft styles ordered should be unified, otherwise it will be very difficult in practical command. When Mr. Lin spoke, he took the purchase of cannons for coastal defense in the late Qing Dynasty as an example. He said that at that time, various seaports ordered from England, Germany, France, and other countries. The cannons were not unfavorable, but when they were actually used, the inconsistencies in the styles of the various places resulted in the shells not matching the diameters, which delayed the war effort. It should be a lesson for us. Therefore, before ordering, all parties should have detailed consultations to achieve unification. Mr. Lin also said that the Aviation Association plans to establish a flying club first, which can be established in January or February. It is easier than establishing an aviation school. Anyone interested in aviation, after a doctor examines and certifies that they are physically qualified, pays a fee to become a member. After six months of practice, they can drive or serve in the civil aviation industry, or after several months of military training, they can be incorporated into the air defense team. The Aviation Administration has agreed to provide the Hongqiao and Longhua Airports for practice. Otherwise, huge expenses will be required to open an airport, etc.</p>

<p>Seventeen More to Arrive in Shanghai in Stages</p>
<p>After Naming, to Be Donated to the Government for Inclusion in the Air Force</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the China Aviation Association, previously, due to the tense war situation, decided to first order twelve fighter planes as a gift to the government for incorporation into its squadrons for use in resisting Japan. Later, at a meeting of executive directors, it was decided to add six more planes, totaling eighteen. These were ordered from the American Aviation Corporation in batches. Some time ago, American pilot Doolittle brought the first aircraft, designated Shanghai City No. 1, to Shanghai, and performed demonstrations at the Bund and Longhua, This aircraft was purchased and delivered to Shanghai by the Association. The naming ceremony is scheduled for 2:00 PM on June 1st at the Jiangwan Racecourse. Central government officials will also be sent to attend. After the ceremony, Mr. Lin will fly the aircraft over Jiangwan for a demonstration. The remaining seventeen aircraft are said to be delivered in stages, with five expected in mid-June, ten in mid-July, and the final two in early August. After each aircraft is named, it will be donated to the government for incorporation into the Air Force. It is reported that all eighteen aircraft are of the same type, with a power of 150 horsepower. They can be equipped with machine guns and carry a large number of bombs. After delivering the aircraft to Shanghai, American pilot Doolittle originally planned to return home immediately. However, due to the need to attend the ceremony, he has postponed his departure. It is said that he will take a liner to Hong Kong in the middle of next month, and then fly to Southeast Asia before returning to Europe.</p>
<h3>Su Zongjun and Others to Go to Hong Kong to Welcome Ma Su Back to China</h3>

<h3>Arrival in Shanghai in Early June</h3>
<p>Generals Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen have been leading their troops in resisting Japan since the September 18th Incident. In the Nenjiang campaign, they inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. Their fierce fighting in Haimang shook the world. Eventually, on June 4th last year, due to exhaustion of ammunition and lack of reinforcements, they were forced to retreat into the Soviet Union, spending over a year in exile. They left Russia for Germany last month, and then went to Italy at the invitation of Zhang Xueliang for a meeting. On the 12th of this month, they embarked on the Italian postal ship Conte Rosso for their return to China. They are expected to arrive in Hong Kong on June 3rd, and should arrive in Shanghai on the 5th, to set foot again on the soil of their homeland, encourage their troops, and continue to resist Japan.</p>

As for Ren Zuo, Yang Dafang, Li Yunqing, Zhan Jiazhou, the magistrate of Hulun County, Wang Weizhe, the president of the Hailaer Support Association of Heilongjiang Province, and Wang Wenying, the president of the Boketu Support Association, representatives of the Northeastern people returning from Russia in Beiping, have all arrived in Shanghai one after another and will wait for Generals Ma and Su in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Preparations for Reception</h3>
<p>Su's son, Zongjun, and Fan Ruizheng, the representative stationed in Peiping, visited Mayor Wu at around 10:00 AM yesterday, and then left to visit Zhu Qinglan, Chu Fucheng, and others, to thank them for their past assistance to Su's troops. Generals Ma and Su are scheduled to pass through Hong Kong without stopping and proceed to Shanghai and then Nanjing to report everything to the central government, before going to Jiangxi and Shanxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to seek military advice. Chairman Chiang and President Wang Jingwei are quite concerned about the safety of Generals Ma and Su, and have specifically wired Mayor Wu to make proper arrangements for their reception and protection when Generals Ma and Su pass through Shanghai. Mayor Wu has already instructed his subordinates to prepare everything.</p>
<h3>Su's Father Encourages His Son</h3>
<p>Su's son, Zongjun, is carrying a handwritten letter from Su's father to Hong Kong, encouraging General Su to lead his old troops to make persistent efforts and continue to resist Japan, not to be arrogant in victory, nor to be discouraged in failure, to kill the enemy for the country, even unto death.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Supports Imposition of New Taxes on Japan</h3>
<p>Telegram to the National Government Requesting Firm Leadership</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance yesterday, supporting the imposition of new tariffs on Japan. The original telegram is recorded below: To the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, As the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement has expired, our country has the right to autonomous tariffs. The Shanghai business community unanimously supports the implementation of new taxes. We earnestly request firm leadership and that the Japanese not be allowed to interfere unreasonably. Signed, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Shang Qiyu Cables Thanks for Condolences and慰勞品</h3>
<p>The Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association received a telegram from Shang Zhen, commander-in-chief of the Second Army Corps of the North China Army, which stated: "Recently, the North China Military Commission forwarded the 850 packages of absorbent cotton gauze, 133 white cloth short shirts and pants, two dozen beef extract, six boxes of milk, and one thousand cans of beef generously donated to our department by your esteemed association.

<h3>Liu Wenhui Telegrams in Response to the Anti-War Association's Message</h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui sent a telegram yesterday in reply to a telegram from the National Federation of the Anti-Civil War League at No. 4 Hong Kong Road in this city, which stated: "Upon receiving the telegram on the 25th, your words are just and sincere, and I am deeply grateful. Although I, Wenhui, am in the military, I have done little to alleviate the current difficulties. I dare not lag behind in uniting internally and resisting foreign aggression. I hope you understand my sincere intentions. Last year, when I returned to the province, I hoped to give the people a rest. However, recently, due to internal divisions within the 28th Army, a reorganization was brewing. Commander Deng Xihou was unable to control his troops, and hoped to provoke foreign conflicts to divert attention. Suddenly, on the 25th, he secretly went to Xin and deployed troops facing each other, and even decided to destroy the Dujiangyan Dam to cover my army. Seeing that foreign troubles were spreading and the Red scourge was not yet settled, I could not bear to repeat internal strife and hasten our demise. I immediately strictly ordered my troops to only defend themselves and not allow the dispute to escalate. Now that I have received a clear order from the Central Government, I have obeyed the order to stop military activities on the front lines and await the Central Government's decision. I have always admired your association's promotion of peace and support for justice. I hope that you will continue to uphold your original intentions and strongly advocate for a joint understanding to end the dispute as soon as possible. I earnestly hope that you will consider this." Signed, Liu Wenhui. (May 27th)</p>
<h3>Important Letter Regarding Centralizing Aviation Donations</h3>

<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that Wu Tiecheng, the chief captain of the General Office of the China Aviation Association's Fundraising Team in this city, sent a letter yesterday to the Aviation Fundraising Committee of the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai, which stated: "The fundraising for the aviation fund in this city has lasted for three months.

Please concentrate the results obtained before the 30th of this month and report them to this office for summarization and action."</p>
<h3>Letter of Advice to Members from the Citizens' Association on Sichuan Road</h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the Shanghai Sichuan Road Businessmen's Association and the Citizens' Branch of the 17th District have issued a notice to advise members to unite and rise up to save the country, which stated: "What the enemy wants is our land. Is it possible that after plundering the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, they will be satisfied with their insatiable greed and allow us to hold on to the remnants and eke out a living forever? The reason why they have temporarily left Tianjin and Beiping without immediately occupying them is because they are forced by diplomatic isolation and economic panic, and are temporarily retreating to advance, placing Tianjin and Beiping under their control and not allowing us to station a single soldier, so that they can seize them in the future. If our people do not unite and rise up to save the country, and leave it entirely to the government's measures, I am afraid that our broken land will no longer belong to us. Those who betray the country still have huge sums of money to pocket and thick faces to hide behind, following in the footsteps of the Jews. But ordinary people like us have no way to escape and will be slaves for generations. This is truly an eternal doom. We and others, who have been entrusted by you to serve as executive committee members of this term, have a duty to do everything we know and can to save the country from its imminent demise and to live up to your trust. We believe that the way to save the country cannot be achieved without collective wisdom and effort, and even more so, it cannot be achieved without strengthening the organization and concentrating its economic strength to support the troops fighting the enemy and saving the country. Therefore, we plan to divide the work of saving the country into two steps. The first step is to start with a precise organization. All citizens of this district who have not joined this association should be recruited to join, so as to provide support and achieve soundness. There is no limit to class, and no distinction is made between boundaries, only those who share enthusiasm and overcome national difficulties together. If there are any who do not comply with this agreement, we should abandon them. The second step is to do everything in our power to deposit money in a public designated bank, so as to gather a little to make a lot, and use it as supplementary funds for the real troops fighting the enemy. We and others will never handle a single cent to avoid suspicion, but the amount of savings should be reported to the association at any time, so that we can understand the amount of money collected in this district. Once needed, it can be concentrated immediately with just a notice from the association. In short, we and others only seek social trust and have no suspicion or worry, so that we can raise our arms and respond from all directions. The future of the country depends on this, and the long-cherished wish of the comrades will be fulfilled. At this point, everyone should embrace the spirit of fearless sacrifice. As long as we have a breath left, we cannot slack off, so as to show the true meaning and strength of the people, so that we will not be reduced to homeless people. Otherwise, it will be like the impassioned and tragic songs of the soldiers at the end of the Ming Dynasty, which are not enough to discuss saving the country. If you have any good ideas, please do not hesitate to teach us, and fight together, which is what we hope for."</p>
<h3>Hundreds of Thousands of Refugees in Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>Qu Yingguang and Others Request Allocation of Relief Funds</p>
<p>To Continue Relieving Refugees in Various Places</p>
<p>Telegraphing Zhang and Du for Champagne Funds</p>
<p>The United Association of Shanghai Charitable Organizations for the Relief of Northeastern Refugees, with its permanent directors in Tianjin, Qu Yingguang and Feng Xuefen, stated that hundreds of thousands of refugees have gathered in Beiping and Tianjin, and their spirits have not settled down. They are living in the open air and eating in the wind, which is truly pitiable. Yesterday, they telegraphed Xu Shiying and others of the association and Zhang Xiaolin and Du Yuesheng, requesting them to allocate more of the remaining charity champagne funds to help continue the relief efforts. The original text is copied below: (1) To Xu Jinglao, Wang Yilao, and all colleagues of the charitable organizations: The telegram has been received. The number of refugees here is increasing every day. They are living in the open air and eating in the wind, which is very pitiful. We are building shacks in places such as the East Bureau Son in Tianjin East, providing food according to the number of people. All expenses, after consultation with local charitable organizations, will be borne half by our association. In addition, refugees sheltered in Beiping and Tongzhou must continue to be relieved. Without huge sums of money, it is impossible to sustain. The charity champagne draw is approaching. It was previously decided to allocate 100,000 yuan to relieve the refugees. We hope to propose and allocate more funds quickly to provide relief. In addition to telegraphing Mr. Xiao and Yue to appeal, we specifically request your help. Please telegraph your instructions. Qu and Fen respectfully. (2) To Mr. Zhang Xiaolin and Du Yuesheng: Hundreds of thousands of refugees have gathered in Beiping and Tianjin. Their spirits have not settled down. They are living in the open air and eating in the wind. If they are not relieved, they will either die in the conflagration or freeze and starve to death. We have now agreed with local charitable organizations to build shacks in districts and provide food according to the number of people. All expenses will be borne half by our association. Qu and others brought relief funds, which are expected to be only enough to be jointly managed with the churches for two months. This huge expense depends entirely on the distribution of charity champagne tickets. It has been previously resolved to distribute 300,000 yuan. We pray for your leadership to allocate more funds to save the dying compatriots. We anxiously await good news. Qu Yingguang and Feng respectfully.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Borrows £400,000 from the Boxer Indemnity</h3>
<p>To Purchase New Ships from England</p>
<p>Two River Steamers and Four Sea Vessels</p>
<p>Since Liu Hongsheng took over the China Merchants Bureau, he has spared no effort in reorganizing the bureau's affairs. However, because all the ships are too old to be used, a ship purchasing committee was organized to add new river and sea vessels. On the one hand, negotiations were held with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Management Committee to borrow funds to purchase ships. This has been approved by the Ministry of Communications. Because the amount of the loan has been increased and the purchase of ships has also been slightly changed as originally agreed, it has been submitted to the ministry for approval. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Boxer Indemnity Committee for verification. Our reporter has specially verified the general outline and recorded it as follows:</p>
<p>Loan Amount</p>
<p>Adding new ships to the China Merchants Bureau is a prerequisite that cannot be delayed. However, the required funds are huge, and the central government cannot temporarily provide this huge amount. Therefore, General Manager Liu Hongsheng was approved by Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua to allocate a portion from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity. Previously, it was proposed to borrow £360,000, which has been approved by Minister Zhu. Because the originally determined amount is still insufficient, General Manager Liu and Minister Zhu have agreed to increase the loan amount to £400,000, which is equivalent to approximately 6.5 million national currency at the current market price.</p>
<p>Purchase of New Ships</p>
<p>The use of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity loan must be specified. The China Merchants Bureau will use the loan to purchase new ships. However, according to established practice, the bureau must purchase ships from England. The bureau has already agreed to this. It was originally agreed to use the funds to purchase two river steamers and four sea vessels, of which three would be regular liners and one would be a temporary liner. Now, there has been a slight change: to purchase two Yangtze River ships and four sea vessels from England, all of which will be regular liners. Yesterday, this intention was submitted to the ministry for the record.</p>
<p>Letter to the Boxer Indemnity Committee</p>
<p>Yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau sent a letter in the name of General Manager Liu to the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee, verifying the details of the loan amendment to £400,000 and the purchase of ships, all of which have been changed to regular liners, in order to comply with the regulations. The letter has been sent out. As soon as the committee replies, the methods for negotiating the disbursement of funds and the procedures for ordering new ships will proceed. At present, the initial procedures for borrowing funds from the Boxer Indemnity have been completed.</p>

<h3>Various Industries Oppose Telephone Rate Increase</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Sends Representatives to Negotiate Without Result</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce accepted the joint letter from more than 30 trade associations, including restaurants, tobacco shops, sauce and wine shops, biscuit and candy shops, and taxi companies, opposing the Shanghai Telephone Bureau's rate increase, the chamber appointed Luo Qinghua and Zheng Chengqing to negotiate. According to Luo and Zheng's statement to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, they went to the Telephone Bureau at 2:00 PM yesterday to meet with Xu Xueyu, the director of the bureau, and requested on behalf of the trade associations that the telephone fees be waived, reduced, or increased in stages during this period of commercial decline to reduce the burden on businesses and citizens. Xu said that he had no authority to handle the above three points and must submit them to the Ministry of Communications for review. The representatives then requested that no hasty action be taken if fees are not paid during the period when various industries are petitioning the Ministry of Communications, so as to avoid disputes. Xu agreed to handle the matter carefully. The representatives then left. It is reported that the trade associations, due to the lack of results in the negotiations, have decided to send representatives to Nanjing to petition the Ministry of Communications to waive the increase.</p>
<h3>Redemption of the Revitalization Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Lottery on June 1st at the HSBC Bank</p>

<h3>County Government County Administration Meeting</h3>
<p>115th Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government held its 115th county administration meeting yesterday, chaired by County Magistrate Cao. Matters discussed included: (1) The county magistrate submitted a report from the County Education Bureau stating that the construction of the staff dormitory project in the new governing area of the bureau has been completed, and requesting that personnel be sent to conduct acceptance inspections on a scheduled basis. It was resolved to send Chief Technician Sun to conduct the acceptance inspections. (2) The county magistrate submitted a report from Director Jiang of the Property Management Office stating that he had complied with the order to convene a review of the county grain management committee's expenses for the 22nd year, and the budget results showed that the distribution was difficult. The draft resolution was to request instructions. It was resolved to convene a grain management committee on a scheduled basis and invite the review personnel to attend and submit their review opinions and Director Jiang's explanation of the difficulties in distribution to be discussed before being submitted to this meeting for decision.</p>
<h3>Grain Committee Discusses</h3>
<p>Measures to Ban Adulteration of Rice</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Grain Committee held its 40th regular meeting on the 26th of this month at the Bureau of Social Affairs. More than ten members attended, including Zhang Binghui, Gu Xin'yi, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Sun Yongyi, Yao Yuannuan, and Lin Dun. Chairman Zhang Binghui first reported on (1) the resolution of disputes over rice measures in the city, (2) the recent status of the original grain property division in Shanghai County, and (3) the investigation into the situation of rice merchants severely speculating. The meeting then began to discuss measures to ban the adulteration of rice. It was felt that the original punishment measures stipulated by the Bureau of Social Affairs, which stipulated that shipowners who added water to the rice on the ships would be detained and severely punished, and the original ship would be confiscated, were too severe, resulting in no one daring to report the crime. According to the rice industry association, the penalties should be reduced to: (1) If a shipowner is found to have added water to the rice, and it is confirmed to be a first offense, a fine of 55 yuan will be imposed. (2) If a shipowner has already been penalized and commits the offense again, a fine of 100 yuan will be imposed. (3) If a shipowner does not change after three offenses, the Shanghai Municipal Rice Industry Association will notify its counterparts in the interior not to engage him permanently. After discussion, it was resolved to add a fine of 100 yuan to the original third provision. The detailed measures are still to be properly drafted by the department of the Bureau of Social Affairs. Later, Committee Member Gu Xin'yi made a temporary motion to request the establishment of a method to compensate for the unfulfilled funds of the warehouse fund raising committee. It was resolved to submit the case to the Bureau of Social Affairs for review. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>The Last Batch of Government-Subsidized Huzhou Silk Shipped to Europe</h3>

<h3>The Barber Industry Weeps, Recounting the Gao Case</h3>
<p>Announcement by the Shanghai Barber Industry Committee for Redressing the Grievances of the Gao Yātou Tragedy: Esteemed Sirs, we respectfully report that our colleague, Gao Yātou, also known as Gao Jinquan, was fifteen years old and the son of Gao Yuanlin from the Xiannvmiao district of Yangzhou. His father had three brothers, none of whom had sons, so Yātou served as the heir to all three branches of the family. Last August, he was introduced by Guo Wanhai to a barbershop on Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession to learn the trade. On the morning of May 7th, at 8:30 a.m., he set up a barber's stall on an open space near Qianjiatang on Avenue Albert to attract customers. Just half an hour later, a Western constable, No. 39, named Mileihong, from the Route Say Zoong Police Station came to check his permits. Gao Yātou, knowing the officer's purpose, felt for his permit but realized he had forgotten to bring it. Fearing a fine, he abandoned his barber's pole and fled north. The Western constable abandoned his vehicle and gave chase. When Gao Yātou ran to the entrance of the Wankang Sauce Garden at No. 216 Qianjiatang, he was suddenly grabbed and slapped in the face. Gao Yātou knelt down to beg for mercy but was kicked violently twice, hitting his scrotum directly. He died instantly. The Western constable, realizing the gravity of his actions, abandoned his vehicle and fled. The crowd witnessed the tragic scene and felt outraged, chasing the constable to the entrance of the Cercle Sportif Français, where they surrounded him and demanded an explanation. The Western constable went to the nearby Yangtse Bus Company to make a phone call to the police station, but was apprehended by the owner of a nearby Faji barbershop. Within moments, a large number of detectives were dispatched from the Route Say Zoong Police Station, intending to move the body and cover up the crime. The crowd prevented them and demanded that the situation be photographed and kept on file by the police station. Faced with public anger, the detectives complied. The body was taken by Tongren Fuyuantang to await examination. On May 8th, it was moved to the French Municipal Council Hospital on Route Massenet for two examinations. No family members of the deceased were present at the scene. Only Guo Wanhai, the deceased's introducer, was present during the autopsy. He described the horrific details of the abdominal incision and head sawing. However, when he inquired about the autopsy results, the doctors did not announce the cause of death. Guo Wanhai also touched the deceased's scrotum with his hand and found abnormalities, requesting that the lower body be examined together, but the doctors and officials present ignored him and told Guo Wanhai to leave immediately. However, according to news reports the following day, both autopsies found no signs of injury. Furthermore, according to reports in various newspapers on May 12th, the French police station released a statement that the investigation revealed that Gao Yātou had long suffered from lung disease, and the cause of death was heart failure due to overexertion. The results of the investigation and autopsy confirmed that running was the cause of death, and the police constable could not be held responsible. On May 10th, a general meeting of the city's barber industry was convened at the barber's guild, with representatives from the Municipal Party Department in attendance to provide guidance. A committee was formed to redress the grievances of the Gao Yātou tragedy, appealing to party and government agencies for assistance and redress. After Gao Yuanlin, the deceased's father, arrived in Shanghai, he hired a lawyer and filed a petition with the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special District Court to request a re-examination. The petition was denied with the response that "the requested re-examination cannot be granted." The above are the details of the Gao case, tearfully reported to all sectors of society, asking for attention and upholding justice. We hope to gain serious diplomatic backing to achieve victory, to comfort the departed soul, and to uphold the rule of law, so that the nation's future will not be bullied by foreigners. We deeply believe that the power of our masses cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>A separate declaration was issued, with the minimum demands being: punish the perpetrator, provide compensation, offer apologies, provide guarantees, improve police affairs, and re-examine Gao's body, among other things.</p>

<h3>The Assassination Case on Xinqiao Road</h3>

<p>Originally Committed a Blood Case</p>
<p>Met an Untimely Death in Shanghai</p>

They rushed to check and found that a man of about thirty years old had been assassinated. He was stabbed with more than ten axes all over his body, and the flesh was blurred. The corpse was wearing a plain white free cloth short jacket, a Zhigong twill single shirt, black rubber shoes, and a white silk belt around the waist.

<h3>Yesterday Morning, Boat Dwellers on the Suzhou Creek Petitioned the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Approved a Three-Month Extension for Relocation</p>
<p>Along the Suzhou Creek in Huxi, Shanghai, there are poor boat dwellers extending for more than ten miles, totaling about a thousand people. The Second Squad of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team ordered them to relocate. These boat dwellers either work in nearby factories, carry goods at the docks along the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek, or work as rickshaw pullers, as well as other hard laborers. If they were to relocate to distant villages, it would affect their livelihoods. Therefore, at 10 a.m. yesterday morning, they petitioned the Municipal Government. The details of the petition are recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, boat dwellers along the Suzhou Creek, regardless of men, women, old, or young, departed from Huxi in batches and walked to Fenglin Bridge. By 9 a.m., six or seven hundred people had arrived one after another, all gathered in the open space in front of the Municipal Government. They elected Wu Shaohua, Xia Xianyang, Cui Dengxian, Qi Guihua, and Qian Huayuan as representatives to take the petition to see the mayor. The mayor sent Xu Shaoxiu, a staff member of the Second Section, to meet the representatives. In addition to handing over the petition in person, they stated that the boat dwellers had been forced to relocate by the water patrol team, which hindered their livelihoods, and that the deadline was very tight, making it difficult to find a suitable place to make a living for a while. They requested an extension of the deadline. The chief staff member said that the instruction to relocate was due to the Junpu Bureau's dredging of the Suzhou Creek. If they were not allowed to relocate, it would hinder the dredging project. However, to show consideration for the boat dwellers, they were granted a three-month extension. If they did not relocate after that, they would be strictly dealt with. The representatives left satisfied.</p>
<p>Petition</p>
<p>In order to tearfully state the hardships and humbly request permission to extend the ban, so as to maintain the lives of the people, we poor people are unfortunate in life and lack resources, so we live by the shore and earn our living by labor. We live in small boats and have been living here for decades. Who knows that the hardships have not been eliminated, and a disaster has suddenly fallen. In recent days, the entire police of the Second Squad of the Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau has been holding weapons and forcing the poor people to relocate. Those who have the slightest doubt are dealt with with iron eagle beaks, destroying the small boats where the poor people's families live. For a time, the boats leaked and sank, causing the poor people to suffer the disaster of being drowned. Those who have suffered this tragic experience are not isolated cases. Alas, we are all citizens, all with four limbs, but due to our poor circumstances, it is difficult to find a way to survive for a while, and we cannot comply with the regulations, which will lead to the doom of family destruction and death. The ancients said, "The poor have no fate." It is truly true. Rather than living to die, it is better to risk our lives to petition. We deeply hope that the distinguished seat will adhere to the Prime Minister's benevolent and compassionate purpose, strive to solve the people's livelihood, and open a compassionate heart to approve an extension of several months before imposing the ban, so as to solve the lives of more than ten thousand people. It is truly a merit.</p>

<h3>Stop Broadcasting Siming Folk Opera</h3>
<p>Obscene Language Endangers Social Mores and National Reputation</p>
<p>Ningbo Native Place Association Sends Warning to Broadcasting Station</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association believes that some broadcasting stations in the city broadcast Siming folk operas with obscene language that endangers social mores. Yesterday, it sent a letter to all broadcasting stations requesting them to stop broadcasting to maintain the nation's reputation. The original letter is recorded below: The radio broadcast of various news, commercial information, music, etc., was originally intended to develop culture, facilitate commerce, and supplement social entertainment, which is a very good intention. However, recently, one or two radio stations, for the sake of profit, have adopted Siming actors' records, with obscene language, which not only endangers social mores but also affects the nation's reputation. It is indeed inconsistent with the original purpose of broadcasting. At a time when customs are declining, how can we allow fuel to be added to the fire, harming society? Therefore, this special letter is a warning. I hope you will investigate and stop broadcasting such obscene lyrics as soon as possible, so that it will be beneficial to both national reputation and social mores, and it should be pleased by your radio station.</p>

<h3>Another Accomplice, the Chauffeur, is Apprehended in the Kidnapping Case of Wei Tingrong</h3>
<p>Wei Tingrong, the former commander-in-chief of the Chinese Volunteer Corps in the French Concession, was kidnapped by bandits on Zhu Baosan Road in the French Concession at 10:30 am on July 24, 1929, and taken into hiding. The family reported the case to the French police, and after the Chinese and Western detectives rescued him from danger in the countryside of Pudong, they successively arrested three bandits, Chen Zhongheng, Tang Shiliang, and Zhu Jingcheng, and sent them to the former French Court, where they were sentenced to five years in the Western Prison. After their terms expired, they were sent to the inland authorities for interrogation. In the autumn of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), Lu Ruowang, Cai Weicai, and Zhao Weisian, three accomplices, were apprehended. The Second Special District Local Court sentenced Lu to life imprisonment and Cai to 20 years in prison. Zhao, being a military man, was ordered to be sent to the military authorities for verification. The case was concluded after three trials, and awaiting execution and transfer. On the 29th of last month, the French police discovered that the chauffeur who drove the car for the bandits at the time of the kidnapping, a local named Qian Lihe, was hiding at No. 345 Chunghua Road in the South City. They immediately went to the address, arrested Qian, and brought him back to the police station to be sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. After the police brought back the previously convicted bandits and interrogated Zhao et al., the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, Wang Wangxu, accompanied by clerk Ren Qiyuan, came to the Criminal Court No. 1 to interrogate them. The police attorney Fei Xizhen stated the police investigation process, saying that the defendant Qian Lihe had confessed to the police that on July 24, 1929, at 7:00 am, he was invited by Zhang Adong (Zhang was murdered for adultery in September of that year) at Qinglong Bridge, Xuejiabang, to meet Cai Weicai, Tang Shiliang, etc., on the second floor of the Ping'an Hotel on Zhu Baosan Road to discuss the kidnapping of Wei. They asked him to drive the car, and he agreed to help drive the car for the kidnapping. Afterwards, Zhang told him to wait for news at No. 309 Kang Nao Road. Now the police are prosecuting him under Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. When questioned, Qian Lihe claimed to be 28 years old, formerly a chauffeur in a South City motor vehicle shop, and now unemployed. He completely denied the kidnapping case and claimed not to know Cai Weicai, Tang Shiliang, Zhang Adong, etc. The judge then ordered Cai Weicai, Zhu Jingcheng, Tang Shiliang, and Chen Zhongheng to be brought in for questioning. Cai and others were brought in in chains. When the judge asked them about the kidnapping case, they all claimed ignorance, saying that they were wrongly accused, and their answers were irrelevant. Finally, Zhao Weisian was brought in, also claiming not to know anything about the kidnapping case and not to know anyone involved. At this point, the court ordered Qian to be returned to custody and rescheduled the interrogation for June 8. Cai, Zhu, Tang, and Chen were sent back to prison, and Zhao was returned to the detention center to await instructions.</p>
<h3>Shen Tianxi, a Victim of Economic Oppression, Commits Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Shen Tianxi, 39 years old, from Changzhou, a plasterer who lived behind the reception room downstairs in the Qitaosheng Building, No. 9 Feixing Lane, Xinmin Road, Zhabei, made a living selling chicken and duck blood near the Gengxin Stage on Xinjiang Road. Recently, due to economic oppression, he suddenly became disillusioned with life. On the day of the Dragon Boat Festival (lunar calendar), creditors crowded his door, and in the evening, he secretly took raw opium and lay in bed, not getting up. It was not until about 2:00 pm yesterday that the second landlord, Ye Taosheng, noticed and sent him to the Pushan Hospital. The doctor found that Shen had been poisoned for a long time and could not be treated, so he died immediately. Ye immediately reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau of the Fourth District with the deceased's niece, named A Jin. The district sent police to investigate. According to Ye Taosheng, the deceased's business selling chicken and duck blood was quite prosperous, earning four or five yuan a day, but he owed too much money, and the money he earned was not enough to pay the interest. The money he borrowed was mostly usurious loans, about five or six hundred yuan, so he often said he wanted to die or not live in Shanghai, etc. He and his wife repeatedly dissuaded him, but unexpectedly last night (i.e., the night before last) he secretly took opium and died. Shen A Jin said, "I am 12 years old and the deceased's niece. I still have my biological parents in my hometown. My father's name is Shen Yansheng. I was raised by the deceased since I was a child, so he treated me as his daughter. On the Dragon Boat Festival, the deceased told me to do business well, that is, to sell chicken and duck blood, and told me to collect the money I earned. If I don't see him when I go home, I can go back to my hometown in Changzhou. At that time, the deceased still had a 'double happiness' silver coin, but now the coin is gone. I think he must have used it to buy opium. I am going back to my hometown now." After the investigating official verified the statements, he ordered Shen Xiaowu, the neighborhood head of the Eleventh Ward, to report to the Shanghai Local Court for an inquest before further verification. The body is currently kept in the morgue of Pushan Hospital.</p>
<h3>Strictly Suppressing Flower Association Gambling</h3>
<p>Strictly Apprehending Flower Association Kingpin Gu Malu</p>
<p>Flower association gambling is strictly prohibited by the police authorities of both the Chinese and foreign concessions. However, the cunning rabbits have three burrows, and they flee from one place to another. It is rare to crack down on flower association factories. Since the French</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>police purchased information and cracked down on a flower association factory at No. 3 to No. 8 Fuyu Lane, Nanyang Bridge, they have strictly prohibited flower association loudspeakers and "ships" (runners) and severely punished those arrested. These people, knowing that it was difficult to gain a foothold, moved into the Chinese area and continued to operate as usual. Yesterday, they were cracked down again by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Strict Suppression in the Concession</p>
<p>The flower association factory opened by flower association kingpin Gu Malu (nickname "Ting Luo Zi") moved from the British Concession to the French Concession. He sets up characters (numbers) wherever he goes and has no fixed place. He widely dispatches his accomplices to various roads and lanes to set up loudspeaker agencies to absorb gambling funds. In the Chinese area, he sends "ships" to collect money from house to house, and then dispatches dozens of people in cars to report characters in sections. After the French police discovered the situation, they added Chinese and French detectives to search pedestrians at the crossroads of various roads and to search houses in various lanes. They arrested and punished those who were found with flower association slips, making it impossible to set up loudspeakers and difficult for "ships" to gain a foothold. Even those who were involved in gambling did not dare to go out, and the gambling trend was greatly reduced.</p>
<p>The Factory Moves into the Chinese Area</p>
<p>At this point, flower association kingpin Gu Malu knew that it was difficult to gain a foothold in the concession, so he moved the factory to the upstairs of No. 3 Linghui Lane, Baoren Street, east of the New North Gate in the Chinese area (a "Xingji New Firm" sign was posted at the door). He continued to set up characters and receive gambling funds three times a day and night. Each character received four or five thousand gold, and gamblers flocked to it. Every time the characters were drawn, half an hour before, gamblers gathered on the sidewalks on both sides of the New North Gate.</p>
<p>Detectives in Disguise Arrest</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau Director Wen discovered the matter. Fearing that the information would be leaked, he secretly dispatched Hong Liang, the captain of the inspection brigade, to supervise dozens of detectives. Half of the plainclothes detectives disguised themselves as gamblers to monitor first, and then the main team of detectives rushed to arrest. As a result, they arrested 30 gamblers and seized flower association slips, account books, and loudspeakers (but flower association kingpin Gu Malu escaped). They took the people to the police brigade and immediately sent them to the Third Section of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Strictly Apprehending Flower Association Kingpin</p>
<p>Director Wen believes that to eradicate flower associations, it is necessary to arrest the leader and bring him to justice. Yesterday, he specifically instructed the supervisors and detective teams to strictly apprehend flower association kingpin Gu Malu and bring him to justice for severe punishment to eradicate gambling.</p>
<h3>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Discusses Anti-Piracy Measures</h3>
<p>In recent days, pirate attacks on merchant ships have occurred frequently. There have been multiple ships attacked, with passengers injured and crew members harmed. This not only hinders shipping but also affects travel. Liu Hongsheng, the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, specifically issued instructions to the heads of various departments yesterday, stating that the sea is not peaceful recently, which is very harmful to travelers and should be prevented to ensure safety. He convened a meeting of the heads of various departments this afternoon to discuss the methods of preventing pirates on sea vessels, and each presented their views for public decision. Then, he ordered the shipowners of each sea vessel to strictly comply.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Public Works Bureau Completes Water Transportation</h3>
<p>The North Route is Extended to Wusong Town, Adding New Ferries</p>
<p>The South Route Travels to Zhoujiadu, Connecting with Automobiles</p>
<p>In order to complete water transportation in the entire city, the Shanghai Public Works Bureau has decided to expand the city ferry organization and add new ferries. Various plans have been carried out separately. According to Tan Boying, the chief of the Fourth Section of the bureau in charge of city ferries, to the Central News Agency reporter, the North Route facilities: The bureau currently has four large and six small ferries. Because the planned routes are insufficient, a large ferry has been added. The load and speed of the ferry are higher than the current ferries. It is expected to be completed in September and will extend the route from Tongren Wharf to Gaoqiao to Wusong Town, using the ferry to travel. The ferry terminal in Wusong Town will also be built one by one, to be realized in October. The reason why the bureau extends the route is that the residents of Wusong and nearby villages purchase goods from the shops in the 16th Pier. Not only is it inconvenient to enter and exit, but also the Shanghai-Wusong Railway does not carry cargo, relying solely on sailboats for transportation, which is a loss in terms of time and money. The citizens of Gaoqiao and Wusong are all citizens of the city and should enjoy the same convenience. Therefore, all preparations are being actively made.</p>
<p>South Route Plan: Water transportation on the North Route of the city will be completed after the Wusong line ferry is realized. Then, the South Route will be considered. The plan is to open one shift per hour from Tongren Wharf to Zhoujiadu to facilitate the citizens of the area. After negotiating with the long-distance company in the area and preparing the method, preparations can be made to complete water transportation in the city as soon as possible. As for the management of wharves and other affairs by the bureau, according to Shi Konghuai, the director of the wharf management office, after the bureau managed the wharf, it tried its best to eliminate various malpractices on the wharf to ensure the safety of travelers and implemented it long ago. Now it still adheres to this spirit to make the wharf management more perfect.</p>
<h3>The Industrial Safety Association Seeks Members</h3>
<p>The First Phase Ends on the 10th of Next Month</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Family Industry Society, Kangyuan Canning Factory, Yonghe Industrial Company, Tianchu MSG Factory, Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory, Chichang New Rubber Factory, and others initiated the organization of the Industrial Safety Association, they actively carried out preparations to establish it as soon as possible and began to solicit members. The announcement is as follows: In order to ensure the safety of factories, the association has joined with various factories to organize the Industrial Safety Association to jointly study methods for preventing disasters and to plan factories that prevent industrial disasters for various factories, or academic groups that support the purpose of the association, are requested to join the association as group members. All individuals or academic experts who support the purpose of the association and are willing to cooperate in promoting industrial safety are requested to join the association as individual members, so that they can work together to protect the lives and health of workers and reduce accidental losses in factories.

The representatives of all group members are requested to indicate their age and position in the group.</p>
<h3>A Foreigner's Car Runs Over a Rural Child</h3>
<p>Shunxiang, the grandson of Ma Fusheng, a farmer in Guqiao, was walking on the Shanghai-Minhang Road near the Beiqiao County Government at about 4:00 pm the day before yesterday. Suddenly, a foreigner drove his own car at high speed, and the child was unable to avoid it, causing him to be knocked down and seriously injured by the car. The police arrived, recorded the car number, and sent the injured child to a Shanghai hospital for treatment. However, he died yesterday afternoon due to severe injuries. It was immediately reported to the court for inspection and verification.</p>
<h3>The Actor Chen Xiaomu is Extremely Licentious</h3>
<p>His Wife Petitions for Mediation and Divorce</p>
<p>Chen Xiaomu, who currently plays the old man in the Sanxing Stage, has always liked women. Since marrying Wang Naizhen in 1926 through a matchmaker, he has not known how to cherish himself and has been pursuing women and creating a bad reputation. Later, he was hired to perform in Hanzhou and dared to seduce women during the performance, which was not tolerated by the local people who attacked him and drove him away. Chen was not tolerated in Hanzhou and returned to Shanghai in disgrace. Unexpectedly, he relapsed not long after. His wife, Wang Naizhen, feared that he would repeat the mistakes he made in Hanzhou and advised him, but Chen not only did not change, but also became worse and vented his anger on her. From then on, he regarded Wang as a thorn in his side and abused her, and invited his concubine to his home to sleep with her publicly and forced Wang to wash clothes for the concubine, which was extremely tyrannical and spread scandalous rumors. Wang, because her concubine usurped her position, treated her as a servant, and was unwilling to endure her breath, naturally resisted and was beaten and kicked by Chen until September last year, when Chen even staged the "Wang Youdao Divorces His Wife" play in his home and forced Wang to leave. Wang could no longer bear it and hired a lawyer to negotiate with him. As a result of the negotiation, Chen promised (1) not to abuse her again, (2) not to seduce women again, and (3) to pay 20 yuan a month for pocket money. Therefore, they reconciled, and Wang lived with him again. Unexpectedly, Chen was fickle, the ink on the contract was not dry, and the evil thoughts of lust re-emerged. In addition to sleeping with prostitutes, he also operated a "golden house" in the Tongshan Lane on Bishi Road in the French Concession, treating his legal wife as a stranger and abandoning her. Wang negotiated with him again, but Chen was cunning and immediately moved his concubine to another place, and the house he rented in Tongshan Lane was also handed over to others. However, he stubbornly denied it after the reconciliation, but Wang felt that Chen did not fulfill his obligation to live together, was not worthy of the name of husband and wife, and continued to oppress her, making her feel unbearable. If she did not cut off the vines, her lifelong happiness would be sacrificed forever. Therefore, she decided to hire lawyer Wang Peiyuan to file a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the First Special District Local Court, requesting that Chen Xiaomu be ordered to come to the court to mediate the divorce and to pay 30,000 yuan for alimony. This morning at 9:00, it was the date for the court to mediate, but Chen Xiaomu refused to appear, and Wang Naizhen came to the court with her representative lawyer, waiting for a long time. Because one party evaded, mediation could not be carried out, so their divorce entanglement will probably have to wait for a formal lawsuit before a ruling can be made.</p>
<h3>Singing Girl Zhao Peiying Accuses Li Shiquan of Enticement</h3>
<p>Zhao is the Adopted Daughter of Fan Shaoshan</p>
<p>Li is a Descendant of Li Hongzhang</p>
<p>Li Shiquan, a descendant of the former Qing Prime Minister Li Hongzhang, who currently resides at No. 4 Chongqing Road, is 24 years old. Recently, Zhao Peiying, 23 years old, the adopted daughter of Fan Shaoshan, who is famous for singing "Tan Huang," filed a complaint with the First Court of the Special District, accusing him of enticement. Yesterday was the date for the trial, which was publicly heard by Judge Wu Zelin in the Criminal Court No. 3. First, the plaintiff said that she was from Pudong and was adopted by Fan Shaoshan as his adopted daughter at the age of twelve and followed him in singing. In 1928, she met the defendant, and the two fell in love. In November of that year, they had a relationship in the East Asia Hotel. Then, he ordered her to leave the Fan family and rented a house in Yanji Lane, Garbage Bridge, and then moved to No. 46 Yongji Lane, Weihaiwei Road. At that time, Zhao was only 21 years old. In addition to paying the rent by Li, she also received 250 yuan per month for living expenses. When they had a relationship, Zhao wanted to hold a formal wedding, but Li said that the wedding was only a formality and could not be relied on, so they could take a photo together as a souvenir. Since March of this year (Gregorian calendar), the supply and Li himself have been cut off. Now, because he abandoned her after seducing her, she requests that he be sentenced according to the law and ordered to continue to bear 250 yuan per month for living expenses for ten years, requesting a one-time payment of 30,000 yuan. When questioned, the defendant Li Shiquan claimed that he completely denied the facts stated by the plaintiff. He had a friendly relationship with Zhao Peiying, but only because he was studying at school at the time and had nothing to do after class, so he accompanied friends to cheer her up. He once sent someone to borrow money because Zhao was pregnant and gave birth, with 2,500 yuan as a break-up fee, which can be proved and has an intermediary, Wu Yixiang, to testify. He married a wife the year before last and was also engaged when he met Zhao. Now he denies all the 30,000 yuan requested by the plaintiff. At this point, Judge Wu summoned the witness Wu Yiqing for questioning and ordered the lawyers for both parties to begin their arguments. After the arguments by the plaintiff's agent, Zhan Jifeng, and the defendant's agent, E Sen, the court ordered that the judgment be announced at 2:00 pm on the 5th of next month.</p>
<h3>Huang Ziqiang is Sent to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Huang Ziqiang, also known as Mu Yan, is from Chengdu, Sichuan. He is 35 years old and resides at No. 25 Xingye Lane, Xiafei Road, French Concession. His brother, Huang Ying, is currently the commander of the Second Division of the 28th Army in Sichuan. Huang once served as the chief of staff of the division headquarters and is currently the Shanghai representative of Deng Hou, the commander of the 28th Army. Recently, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Headquarters Garrison Command stating that Huang had reactionary communist activities in Shanghai and should be immediately arrested and sent to Beijing for interrogation. Director Wen Hongen, upon receiving the order, prepared a document and sent personnel to the French police on the afternoon of the 17th of this month to request assistance in the arrest. The Minister of Political Affairs sent Chinese and Western detectives to rush to Huang's residence at 10:30 pm that night, arrested Huang, and seized books, documents, and other evidence, and brought them back to the police station. The next day, he was sent to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and prosecuted for endangering the Republic of China under Article 1, Section 3. After being detained for investigation, the court rescheduled the hearing. After the police completed the investigation, Zhou Yunhui, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, together with judges Guo Dezhang and Fan Peien, and Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei, came to the Criminal Court No. 3 to interrogate him. The police lawyer Yuan Jiahong appeared in court, and the defendant Huang Ziqiang hired lawyer Tan Yigong to defend him. Jiang Yuewu, the supervisor of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, along with detectives, came to the court and requested permission to transfer the defendant to the bureau for interrogation. The court then announced that because the case was related to politics, bystanders were prohibited from attending the hearing. According to reports, the court ruled that because the defendant was an active-duty military officer, the court had no jurisdiction and ordered the defendant Huang Ziqiang to be handed over to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>A Counterfeit Money Headquarters is Cracked Down in Zilaishui Street</h3>
<p>The Main Criminal, Zhou, is on the Run</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a group of extremely idle people who specialize in using counterfeit money in various cigarette and paper shops in the concession. However, the headquarters of the counterfeit money often moves, so it is difficult for the authorities to crack down on it. A Shandong native, Zhu Lingheng, used a ten-yuan counterfeit banknote at a small cigarette and paper shop opened by Wang Cai, a woman on Xihuade Road. Wang was unable to detect the authenticity, and sent an apprentice to inspect nearby shops. Zhu became nervous and wanted to retrieve the counterfeit banknote, causing a dispute. The Chinese detective Zhang Guisheng found out the situation, questioned him, and sent Zhu and the counterfeit banknote to the First Special District Local Court for detention. After Zhang detected that there was another accomplice, Tang Jinfu from Zhenjiang, hiding at No. 840 Fangbang Road in the Chinese area, he reported to the head of the police, and together with the Western detective, rushed to the Public Security Bureau in charge and arrested Tang, seized a bundle of white paper for printing counterfeit banknotes. He learned that the headquarters was located at No. 160 Lianmeng Lane, Zilaishui Street, French Concession, and the main criminal was surnamed Zhou. The detectives went to the French police to assist in the arrest, but Zhou had already fled when he heard the news. Only two five-yuan counterfeit banknotes and 100 bullets and a pair of handcuffs were seized. However, the prohibited items were not related to the counterfeit money case and were taken back by the French detectives for investigation. Yesterday, Tang was sent to the Special Court, and Judge Wu Zehan interrogated him. The police lawyer Chen Ming explained the situation and requested detention and presented the counterfeit banknotes for inspection. Judge Wu briefly questioned the defendant, ordered him to be returned to custody, and rescheduled the hearing to be combined with the case.</p>
<h3>Fang Jiaobo Sends a Letter to the Fisheries Association</h3>
<p>Liu Tonghua and other four families of the Shanghai Ice Fresh Fish Industry Association resisted paying the fishery construction fee. The Fisheries Improvement Committee issued strict orders to supervise them separately. The other day, Liu and others submitted a document stating that Fang Jiaobo, a member of the industry director and the association, had guided them. Yesterday, Fang Jiaobo sent a special letter to the Fisheries Improvement Association, the original letter is as follows: Dear Sir, I recently read a report stating that Liu Tonghua and others of the Dacheng Fish Industry Association stated in their document to your association that the association was guided by me and elected Dai Qiu and other four people to consult with the collection office and request that the method be changed and the collection be made on-site from the fishermen, and our association in Shanghai will not be responsible for withholding it. I am deeply shocked. When the association held a meeting on the construction fee, I attended and advocated that since there were many people, it was inconvenient to talk, and Dai Qiu should be elected to make an appointment with the collection office to discuss a proper method, and there was no indication that the collection should be made on-site from the fishermen or that the fish industry association would not be responsible for withholding it. What the Dacheng Industry Association said is completely inconsistent with the facts. I am afraid that there will be misunderstandings. I am writing this letter to clarify the situation, I hope you will take note of it. To the Fisheries Improvement Committee of the Jiangzhe District of the Ministry of Industry, Fang Jiaobo, May 29.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I have read the article in your newspaper that He Fangpu has not yet been released. The article states that according to investigations, although He has no master-servant relationship with Mitsui now, He's original position is still inherited by He's eldest son, so it cannot be said that there is no relationship at all. Also, it is said that every time goods arrive, He must take the opportunity to purchase Japanese sugar in bulk and obtain huge profits, which is shocking. It is found that my father was arrested by the Zhejiang Provincial authorities this time because of false accusations by those who held grudges. Once the matter is clarified, the truth will come out. However, the claim that my father's position at Mitsui was inherited by his eldest son is inaccurate. Although Bo Yan also worked at the company when my father was at Mitsui, after my father resigned, he completed the unfinished procedures and also left the relationship with Mitsui. He is now employed at Lida Zhuzhou Bearing Company, No. 81 Xihua Road in this city. The facts are all there and cannot be falsified. As for the bulk purchase of Japanese sugar, it is even more of a fabrication out of thin air. I am afraid that it will confuse the public. Therefore, I am specially writing to your newspaper to correct it in order to clarify the truth. I would be grateful. Respectfully, Shenbao Newspaper Editorial Department, Editor-in-chief, He Boyan, May 29.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I have just read the news in the "City News" column of your newspaper on May 28 about the donation for aircraft purchase, which involves our factory. It is found that the aircraft donated exclusively by our factory has already been ordered and the price is above 100,000 yuan. It will arrive soon. Regarding the self-ordering and the type of aircraft purchased, the consent and instructions of all relevant parties have been obtained. The statement that "the Aviation Patriotic Association has repeatedly requested it without success, and negotiations are still underway" is completely untrue. Please correct it in order to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Shenbao Newspaper, Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Company Manufacturing Plant Management Office, May 28.</p>

<h3>Where to Go is the Road to Survival</h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Wang Bin of Songjiang丨</p>
<p>I am several years old this year. When I really have no way to go, I specially write a letter to describe my situation. Because in my childhood, I never suffered the pain of receiving a proper education. Moreover, I lost my mother one after the other before I was even ten years old. At that time, I lived with my brother. When I was fifteen years old, an acquaintance of my father from Japan introduced me to work as an apprentice in a factory. After three years, the factory director paid me a monthly salary of four yuan. It has been nine years this year. In the past, when I was a child, I could pass the time unknowingly. Now, there is no way to go. Why? It is because two years ago, my brother thought that I was of age and should establish a family. At that time, I didn't know what the heavy burden of family responsibility was, so I followed orders. Who knew that after only three years, I am already heavily in debt. Moreover, a small child was added last year. Now, the expenses have increased. Before my wife gave birth, she could still do some work to help. Now, she can't. My brother also has the burden of a family. I have exhausted my loans from relatives and friends. I want to find a job with a higher position and a higher salary. I have already said above that I have not received a proper education. I have no qualifications at all. Even if people want to hire staff, they always want people with proper qualifications. Moreover, the society is now in a panic. There are many unemployed people. There are also many people with educational degrees. Who would want to hire me? I want to improve my situation in this factory to meet the family expenses, but I can't. Because the business is now declining terribly. The boss's principle is to reduce expenses. My monthly salary is only eight yuan. May I ask how my family of several people can live now? If I ask the boss for a raise, he will immediately fire me. I am about to lose my job. I want to find work, but no one will introduce me. I want to go to the countryside to farm, but I have no land. I want to commit suicide, but I can't. Under these thoughts, I really have no way to go. I can only beg the reporter, who has insight and a virtue of loving life, to think of a perfect way to survive for me and reply!</p>
<p>Answer: Almost half of our readers are asking questions because they have no way out of life. This shows the widespread economic bankruptcy in the current society, not only in the countryside but also in the cities. It is really difficult for us to come up with ways for everyone to live, because this is a social problem as a whole. I hope that our dear readers, when it comes to this kind of problem, never focus only on themselves and their families, and the purpose of their struggle should not be limited to the interests of themselves and their families. Your problem is the same. I hope you think from a big picture perspective and fight for the community. A way to survive will naturally appear. Correction Yesterday's column, line 41, after "or the interests of a few people?", the sentence "or from the social interests of the majority of the masses?" was omitted; in line 53, after the three words "or Pu", the word "bian" was omitted; in line 86, the three words "with its saying" were redundant; in the second to last line, the word "the" in "the holy scripture" was redundant. Combined corrections. Communication procedures: (1) Provide full name, age, gender, place of origin, occupation, and detailed address. (2) Attach sufficient return postage. (3) Affix the communication stamp in the upper corner of this column. The description of facts in the letter should be simple and clear, and the handwriting should be clear. All letters that do not include sufficient return postage or do not provide a detailed address, except for those that may be published in this column, will not be replied to.</p>

<h3>Joint Appeal from Shanghai University Students to All Students in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Way to Save the Nation Lies in Long-Term, Effective Struggle</p>
<p>Those indulging in romantic pastimes should abandon their bad habits.</p>
<p>Those chasing after movies and dances should eliminate their addictions.</p>
<p>Study "The Last Lesson" with the spirit of killing the enemy on horseback.</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Student Union issued an appeal to all students in Shanghai, stating: "China's internal and external troubles have reached their peak. At this critical juncture, everyone should have the spirit of passionate endeavor, indignation, and desperate effort. However, the way to save the nation lies in effective struggle, and everyone must do their best and fulfill their responsibilities. Our current responsibility as students is to study. We should deeply understand the difficulties of the current situation and always take saving the nation and revitalizing the nation as our own responsibility. Those indulging in romantic pastimes should abandon their bad habits, and those chasing after movies and dances should eliminate their addictions. With the spirit of killing the enemy on horseback, we should strive to learn, train our minds and bodies, and strengthen our will. We should strive for practicality in our studies and practice in our actions, so that we can acquire real knowledge today and shoulder the great responsibility of revitalizing the nation in the future. This is what we university students should encourage and pledge to ourselves during this period of national crisis. Recently, reactionary factions and traitors in this city have spread rumors that our students will go on strike. We sincerely do not know on what basis they say so. We recognize the seriousness of the current environment and believe that only persistent struggle can save the country. However, to engage in long-term and effective struggle, we must rely on the basic knowledge of saving the country. Shanghai students should have the spirit to finish reading 'The Last Lesson.' The model of Turkish revival is already there, and the precedent of Alsace-Lorraine is not far away. May all university students in Shanghai encourage each other."</p>

<h3>The Talent-Rich 19th Route Army Soccer Team Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Led by Jin Yiting, Huang Meishun and 19 others arrive first</p>
<p>Xu Xiang and Liu Zukan from Shanghai will join the team to work together</p>
<p>The team will stay in Shanghai for two weeks to await the return of the East China team</p>
<p>The soccer team of the Youth Military Service Corps of the First Column of the 19th Route Army, led by Corps Leader Jin Yiting, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the Jinan steamer from Xiamen and stayed at No. 4 Yipinxiang. Xu Heng and Liu Zukan from Shanghai will join the team. The team will stay in Shanghai for two weeks to await the return of the Donghua team from the Philippines for a match, before leaving Shanghai for Wuhan.</p>
<p>Origin of the Organization</p>
<p>After the 19th Route Army decided to go north from northern Guangdong, Zhang Yan, commander of the First Column, considering that many young people would enthusiastically participate in this departure, initiated the organization of the Youth Military Service Corps. In addition to setting up propaganda and other departments, there was also a sports department. In addition to sports propaganda, it could also supplement military needs with ticket income, which led to the creation of the 19th Route Army soccer team.</p>
<p>Members Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>The first batch of 19 people arriving in Shanghai yesterday included Corps Leader Jin Yiting, Section Chief Chao Zhongyuan, Secretary Wu Qinrao, and team members Huang Mei , Tang Kun, Zheng Shaokang, Liang Darong, Du Kecheng, Yang Benhan, Yang Guohua, You Huaxing, Gan Xihui, Xu Yaoxian, Hui Lin, He Qi, Zeng Zhi , Tang Baoxing, Huang Xing, Lin Dacheng, Zhang Xiuquan, Zhang Shao . Many of them are soccer players from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Second Batch Arriving</p>
<p>The four knights of the South China Soccer Team, Feng Zuixiang, Tan Liangbai, Bei Hua, Li Tiansheng, as well as Zhu Guolun, Jiang Zan, Huang Jiliang, and Huang Dingfen, will come in the second batch. The date of their arrival in Shanghai is currently uncertain. The players from Shanghai who will participate are Liu Zukan and Xu Heng.</p>
<p>Activities in Shanghai</p>
<p>The team will stay in Shanghai for about two weeks. Now is the end of the soccer season. The West Union team no longer exists, and the Donghua team has also gone south to the Philippines. The Shanghai Football Association and Yu Heng are in contact to arrange matches in Shanghai. They will probably play several matches. The Donghua team is expected to return to Shanghai around June 12th. The team will wait for their return to Shanghai and will also arrange a match. The issue of the venue is being discussed with Shen Siliang.</p>
<p>Leaving Shanghai for Wuhan</p>
<p>After the match with the Donghua team, the team will leave Shanghai for Hankou around the 15th to join the army. They will then leave Wuhan for the north. There will also be one or two matches in Wuhan. The issue of going north cannot be predicted at this time.</p>

<h3>Breaking the Mystery of the Current Situation</h3>
<p>— Shan Lu</p>
<p>Is the mystery of the current situation not easy to break? Easy, easy.</p>
<p>What way to break the mystery of the current situation? Break it two ways, by reversed riddle and by tying a bell with a red bean.</p>
<p>Those who love riddles will certainly understand the way to guess them. There is the reversed riddle, to read the riddle backwards. There is the bell-tied riddle, to add a voiceless word to the riddle. There is the red bean riddle, to make one sentence of the riddle into two sentences. Whatever negative words, by using a reversed riddle can be changed into doubt and uncertainty. By using a bell-tied riddle with a red bean riddle, one can change negation into affirmation. By using these kinds of methods to guess the mystery of the current situation, one can probably tear off this piece of riddle paper.</p>
<p>For example, the diplomat's set phrase "Absolutely no humiliation," is a mystery of the current situation. The first step is to use the reversed riddle and the bell-tied riddle to guess it, that is, "humiliation does not decide;" so it is clear that the diplomat cannot resolve the words humiliation. The second step is to use the bell-tied riddle with a red bean riddle to guess it, the word "no" tied with a bell, becomes the word "negation:" and using the red bean riddle to divide one sentence into two sentences, the form is like: "Is there humiliation? Deciding." "Is there humiliation?" is a question; the word "deciding" is an answer, it means deciding to be humiliated; then negation becomes affirmation.</p>
<p>Let's guess two more mysteries of the current situation: for example, the soldiers' "Absolutely no retreat," using a reversed riddle, becomes "Letting retreat does not decide." Using a bell-tied riddle with a red bean riddle, it becomes "Letting retreat? Deciding." Another example, the important people's "Absolutely no peace talks," using a reversed riddle, becomes "Peace talks not decided." Using a bell-tied riddle with a red bean riddle, it becomes "Peace talks? Deciding."</p>
<p>How sad this is! Is there humiliation? Deciding. Is there retreat? Deciding. Are there peace talks? Deciding. Alas! Such is the mystery of the current situation.</p>
<h3>Rural Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>The countryside is bankrupt, the farmers all throw down their hoes and iron shovels and sneak into the city. If the people in the city, besides the foreign relief wheat, will soon have no food to eat, what will they do?</p>
<p>Rural bankruptcy is really not a fashionable thing. I remember when I still had a small pigtail tied with red velvet rope, there was already a large group, a large group of famine refugees, coming from north of the river, thousands of miles away, to the south of the river. Is this not ironclad proof that rural bankruptcy was already all the rage twenty or thirty years ago? These famine refugees have continued to come to my hometown every year until now. Nothing has changed much from twenty years ago, and we still eat three meals of white rice every day. So rural bankruptcy, even if it goes bankrupt, there's no need to panic.</p>
<p>But we eat three meals of white rice every day, and if we have some leisure time, then we might as well study the problem of rural bankruptcy, if necessary.</p>
<p>I remember when I used to visit the famine refugees in the countryside, there were often several old men with the faces of lords, wearing tan leather robes and velvet vests, sitting in sedan chairs, in each group, and I was very puzzled. Later, I found out that these were all wealthy households, what are now called big landlords. Wealthy households had inexhaustible rice and inexhaustible money. No matter how bankrupt the tenant farmers were, they could not break the wealthy households, but the tenant farmers said that if the wealthy households did not flee the famine, everyone would eat the wealthy households, and the wealthy households could not bear to pull a hair to benefit the tenant farmers, so they had to sit in sedan chairs and flee the famine.</p>
<p>Since then, everyone has been shouting the slogan of saving the villages, but I don't know how the honorable committee members will start. The peasants have no organization, and to provide relief, it is inevitable that they will have to connect with the sedan chair-sitting famine refugees who have the qualifications of gentry directors. Oh, that's how it's done. Those who sit in two-person sedan chairs are afraid that they will greatly get some grease, and change to sitting in four-person sedan chairs. Rural bankruptcy, that's really bankrupt.</p>
<p>By then, we will probably have to replace our three meals of white rice with relief wheat.</p>
<h3>Funeral</h3>
<p>— Chonglou</p>
<p>In the city, I often see magnificent funerals.</p>
<p>In front are swaggering cavalry, bands in red and green uniforms, walking teams carrying various sacrificial offerings, monk and Taoist teams with yellow faces and dark nights due to opium smoking, followed by bands and walking teams..., and all people and objects, winding and advancing!</p>
<p>The filial sons (?) are walking in front of the coffin, although they say they are "stupefied and delirious, in unbearable pain." But they have not forgotten to send a few bodyguards to protect them in case of accidents due to walking.</p>
<p>The funeral cars followed slowly behind the procession, as if they had lost their authority to speed. However, in this kind of disharmonious situation, you can hear the crowded onlookers laughing and cheering beside you and saying, "This is a very good-looking grand funeral!"</p>
<p>The person is already dead, but the person's bones are still being used as a tool for a funeral! Someone said, "The dead are often deceived by the living," and I believe it even more after watching the funeral.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Mirage in Qingdao</h3>
<p>— Zhuying</p>
<p>In the sea off Qingdao, in the undulating mountains and rocks fifty li from the shore, in a place called Maizuru Beach, at half past eleven at noon on May 22, a strange sight suddenly appeared: pavilions and towers, higher than the mountain peaks, the so-called mirage. The buildings looked like two large-scale factories, with windows and doors open and people walking back and forth. In this instant, even the work of gods could not be so fast, but now it suddenly appeared before our eyes.</p>
<p>At that time, my friend Mr. Qu Yisan was strolling on the fine sand of the beach. When he saw this strange sight, he was shocked and thought he had never seen it in his life. He wanted to call me by phone to share this spectacle that had not been seen for thousands of years, but there was no phone there. So he sent Mr. Mou, who was traveling with him, to send a letter to my residence. I was napping when I suddenly heard the news. I hurriedly went, and when I arrived, I saw that the mirage in the sea had gradually dissipated, only about ten feet from the water line.</p>
<p>The buildings were light ochre in color, no different from the mountains and rocks, lying flat on the water. Sails came and went on the water, making it difficult to distinguish between real and illusion. At that time, some tourists on the beach hired fishing boats to go and see the strange sight, but they sank when they reached the spot and returned in disappointment. Behind the buildings was a city wall, and in front were trees, like the scene of Qianmen in Beijing. On the left was a small pavilion, with white clouds gushing high below it, like an ancient painting hanging deep in the sea and sky, no wonder the viewers praised it as a miracle.</p>
<p>Since the news of the appearance of the mirage spread, people on Zhongshan Road rushed to see it, and the road was blocked. Everyone scrambled to be first, some by rickshaw, some by motorcycle, and some by bicycle. Cars and horses came and went, rushing and bumping, regardless of everything, for fear of missing it.</p>
<p>As a result, a group of superstitious people started rumors, some saying what would happen to Qingdao, some saying what would happen to the overall situation. The general residents were surprised and their opinions were divided. Others said that it was a mirage opening its abdomen and exposing its scales, using the sunlight to dry them, and reflecting the scenery of the buildings on the shore into the scales, and from the scales, reflecting them onto the shore. Others said that if they could take out the pearls and gems from its belly and set them as lamps and candles, and burn them with fire at night, they would see the buildings floating in the candlelight, as if they were appearing in the sea. Although the words were unfounded, they were enough to comfort the longing of those who had not seen it.</p>
<p>The beach was crowded with people, with thousands of heads moving. The rocks on both sides of Nanhai Shimen were blocked by viewers, with no room to insert a foot. Everyone scrambled to see this rare sight of a century, but the good times did not last long, and in a blink of an eye (after about an hour) it was no longer visible. As a result, those who came later could only sigh in disappointment. Unable to see this spectacle, they all hoped that it would reappear on the sea at this time tomorrow, so they could enjoy it to the fullest, but it could not be as people wished.</p>
<p>According to the theory, a mirage is entirely the result of atmospheric effects. The temperature is lower than the air, and after several refractions, it reflects the scenery of palaces and cities, appearing faintly and reflecting into people's eyes. This phenomenon often occurs in the spring and summer, when the wind is calm and the waves are gentle.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor I read Mr. Zheng Jun Yimei's anecdote about Lu Zijia in your newspaper yesterday, and it is quite different from the truth. It must be a mistake in the transmission. I have been in Lu's staff for a long time. It is not necessary to pursue the rights and wrongs of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang war, but Lu never advocated war. He twice secretly instructed me to come to Shanghai and ask Mr. Tang Shaochuan to find a way to mediate from the side. Mr. Shaochuan is still alive and can be questioned. As for whether there was any appropriation of military pay from Xia Chao or slapping, it has not been ten years, and the gentry in Zhejiang should be able to recall it, so I don't need to defend it on his behalf. According to the investigation, Lu's father disappeared during the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year. Although most of what a certain tabloid reported yesterday was inconsistent, the disappearance was indeed a fact. His mother had already passed away before the Jiangsu-Zhejiang war, so how could there be a mother? As for Lu's never having jewels and antiques, and never speaking harshly to his subordinates, anyone who has even one day of acquaintance with Lu can say this. As for what this attendant said, I don't know what he saw that made him say that. I hope you will examine and reveal the truth. Respectfully, Liao An</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3>News on the Lake</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Since the invasion of rayon, the Chinese silk industry has declined rapidly, because the prices are so different, the buyers are greedy for cheap goods, and the merchants value profits. These eight words have become an incurable disease. After the January 28th Incident last year, I had several articles in the Machine Alliance, expressing my views, hoping that the price of natural silk could compete with rayon. Unexpectedly, the real silk brocade sold at the Hangzhou National Goods Exhibition this time was actually cheaper than rayon. Each piece was only fourteen yuan, four yards and six feet long and two feet four inches wide, only about three corners per foot. The lowest price for rayon brocade was three corners and four cents per foot. Therefore, I cut one strip of each and burned them with a match. The real silk only felt scorched and swollen, like opium paste, and did not turn into ash. The rayon, on the other hand, was no different from cloth strips, and immediately turned into flying ash. If rayon and natural silk are interwoven and burned, the truth and falsehood are also obvious and cannot be hidden. Therefore, I think this kind of testing method is very simple, everyone can try it on the spot, and everyone can identify it. Our Hangzhou has this beautiful and cheap product, how can other places not? If it can be like this, not only can rayon be defeated, but also foreign yarn can be defeated, because cloth woven with fine yarn is called domestic, but it is actually spun from foreign cotton. Among the 500 million yuan of excess imports, cotton, rice and wheat are only three items. If everyone rejects fine cloth and uses big brocade, there is no danger of excess spiritual silk and there is no need to sell it abroad. This kind of big brocade, in terms of its labor and capital, even if it is sold for three corners a foot, is only a strategy of small profits and quick turnover, and it will not lead to losses. The average weight of each bolt is only one pound and seventy-five. Calculated at a silk price of 640 yuan per dan, the raw materials used are only eight yuan and four corners. The weaving cost is one corner per foot, only four yuan and six corners. Even the profits earned by the sellers have exceeded the normal rate of five percent and cannot be said to be too thin. On the user side, it can be said to be the most affordable. The price of foreign cloth still needs more than two corners per foot, so why not use this big brocade instead of buying foreign cloth? If cloth must be used, then domestic cloth should be purchased to avoid the outflow of rights and interests. But if everyone holds this purpose, then the two items of rayon and American cotton can be resolved, and the revival of the countryside can be awaited. Really looking forward to it.</p>
<h3>Club</h3>
<p>— Zhou Cailiang</p>
<p>Speaking of clubs, everyone knows they are places for leisure and entertainment. Examining the origin of this term, it is indeed an authentic product from the East. Initially, only the major commercial ports in our country had them, and the members were mostly Chinese who served foreign merchants. Whenever there were holidays, the members would arrive as agreed. All kinds of elegant entertainment facilities, such as string and bamboo music, books and newspapers, and chess (tea is a given), were almost all available. The so-called "catering to individual preferences" allowed everyone to relax and enjoy themselves, which was truly beneficial in alleviating work fatigue and refreshing the spirit. Later, as the trend opened up and more people imitated, the quality of the members became uneven. As a result, gambling entertainment like "mahjong" gradually became popular. As time passed, it slowly encroached upon the club's primary function. Moreover, because the club's organization was a legitimate group, it seemed that the authorities tacitly allowed it to enjoy the special privilege of guaranteeing gambling safety. Where there is profit, everyone will be envious and imitate. Not to mention distant places, let's just take my hometown (Zhangxi), a remote coastal area, as an example. In a small town with less than a thousand households, there are forty or fifty teahouses and taverns that provide entertainment (not including tobacco). Among them, the disguised gambling dens of clubs are the most prevalent. Even during the busy farming season, people are still gambling day and night. From the gentry class to the laborers, whether they know each other or not, they almost all revel in it. Ordinarily, this would mean that the market would be somewhat prosperous, and the farmers' lives would be unusually comfortable. But the reality is quite the opposite. It is said that since the salt harvest last autumn, due to the cheap grain hurting farmers, the pawnshop business, which regulates the economy of the common people, has plummeted (more pawns than redemptions). The sluggishness of other businesses is also imaginable. So, the fact that the business of clubs (taking my hometown as an example) is exclusively prosperous is actually accelerating the collapse of the entire rural economy. Alas! I never thought that after decades of revolution and education in our country, the result has been the popularization of mahjong education everywhere. Since the people are so fond of pleasure, how can the national affairs not fall into a state of "Isn't it delightful?" Alas! What can I say!</p>

<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>

<p>Chapter Eight: Indignant Words Stir Youth to Resign and Flee;</p>
<p>Passionate Compassion for a Maiden Leads to a Grave Visit.</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang, in the heat of wine and excitement, suddenly changed the subject and mentioned the old Mrs. Yang in the front yard. Guan Yaowu felt that his suggestion couldn't be without meaning, so he immediately went to the front yard to meet Mrs. Jiang. In the courtyard, he first shouted, "Happy New Year!" and then pushed the door open and went into the house. Mrs. Jiang greeted him with a smile, "Cousin is here. Guizhi, quickly make tea." Guizhi responded and came out. Today, she was wearing a brand-new patterned cheongsam. Following the customs of the Manchu people, she still had a long braid. In front of her forehead, she had long bangs, which showed that even though she was over twenty years old, she still retained her virgin beauty. Although her face was painted with thick powder like other Manchu girls, her skin was much more delicate than ordinary people. When she smiled, her red lips revealed two rows of white teeth, which were beauties that other girls over twenty could not have. Guan Yaowu immediately thought, "With such a good girl, and able to do both rough and fine work, what else could my brother not want? It's just that because of the neighborly relationship, it's hard to bring it up." Then again, a talent like Cousin should at least marry someone like Zhao Ziqiang to be worthy of her. In the instant Guan Yaowu entered the door, looking at Guizhi's face, he had already turned over several thoughts. Guizhi, seeing him paying so much attention, felt a little embarrassed and couldn't help but lower her head. She picked up the teapot, poured tea, and said, "What's wrong? Cousin is staring at me today. Is there anything special about my face today?" Guan Yaowu smiled, "I can read faces. I see that the stars of romance and marriage are shining on your face. Good news is coming." Guizhi placed a cup of tea on the old tea table and pushed it in front of him. With a pout, she said, "It's the first month of the year, say something good." Guan Yaowu tilted his head and looked at her, saying, "Is 'stars of romance and marriage are shining on your face' bad? Do you know what the stars of romance and marriage are?" (85)</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on "Force-feeding" Education</h3>
<p>— Tianyi</p>
<p>The other day, someone talked about education from the perspective of force-feeding, saying that educators today are mostly doing the work of force-feeding. Teachers are unwilling to consider students' interests, nor do they consider the needs of the current society and era. They only squeeze a bunch of so-called "knowledge" as food and cram it into students' bellies. Once the students' bellies are full, they consider their only responsibility fulfilled. This analogy is certainly very harsh, but I think that if the teachers today really had a bunch of "knowledge" as food in their hands, and could really fill the students' bellies like force-feeding a duck, then it would still be considered passable. But the fact is that most teachers today never had food in their hands in the first place. The reason why they "tirelessly teach" is not to fill the students' bellies, but only to fill their own bellies.</p>
<p>If we do not deny the facts, we must admit that the educators of today, the superiors are acting as magicians, the middling ones are like playing gramophones, and the inferior ones are simply using students as tools for food and clothing. What is meant by acting as magicians? Today, they move in Eastern systems, and tomorrow, they boast about European and American doctrines. They change old-fashioned essays without seeking to adapt to reality, and without seeking any efficiency. Just like performing magic tricks, the performers only show off their novelty and boast about their cleverness. What is meant by playing gramophones? The sound emitted by a gramophone is only a passive action, a mechanical call, simply chanting stereotyped songs. Many teachers are also like this, teaching only for the sake of teaching, without any purpose. Education cannot be used in a lively way, and becomes a dead and clumsy "form," or a tool for decorating the eyes and ears. As for using students as tools for food and clothing, the fact is even more obvious, and we don't need to elaborate here. Because education is like this, the result of education is only to cultivate high-level idlers for society, and to create bureaucrats and politicians for the country. Although force-feeding education does not have positive benefits for society, the negative harm is also relatively small. However, this kind of force-feeding education is also rare today!</p>
<h3>Don't Cry!</h3>
<p>— Ma Guoliang</p>
<p>Perhaps some people have never enjoyed a moment of happiness from birth to death, but no one has never experienced pain, whether directly from the spirit or indirectly from material things.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of pain, and we seem unable to use objective and fixed standards to measure and say which kind of pain is deeper or shallower. This varies from person to person, from time to time, and from place to place. Just like a child losing his favorite toy, and a rich man losing his wealth, who can say which of these two people is suffering more?</p>
<p>But although we cannot say which type of pain is the lightest, we can say which type of pain is the greatest. This is the pain of "having pain but not being allowed to express it."</p>
<p>A child loses his toy and is not allowed to cry, a rich man loses his wealth and is not allowed to sigh, or complain to others. Is there any pain in the world that is deeper than this?</p>
<p>In everyday life, when we encounter misfortune, we will definitely find a friend, or a relative who can sympathize with us, to tell them the troubles that are suppressed in our hearts. Although this does not help the facts, it makes us feel much better when we have the opportunity to pour it out. This is an experience that everyone has had. If you can't find someone to talk to, just cry out loud, or vent through writing, books, or music. These are all methods people usually use to vent their pain. Chuan Baicun's so-called art is a symbol of suffering, is what this means.</p>
<p>As for the father being killed, the son goes through all kinds of hardships to kill the enemy. In fact, it is clear that killing the enemy cannot bring the dead father back to life. There is no other reason than to vent the pain caused by the father's murder. To take a more ordinary example, someone breaks a vase in their home because they are extremely angry. We cannot laugh at them for being stupid. Only the smartest people can think of breaking a vase to relieve the pain when they are in so much pain that they cannot vent it.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that although people have no way to resist the coming of pain, they know how to get rid of it after it comes. If even the right to get rid of pain is deprived, isn't that the most unbearable thing? Mansfield, in her "Ma Parker," said that this old woman has tasted all the tragedies of life, but doesn't even have a place where she can cry to her heart's content. Life to this point is truly more tragic than death!</p>
<p>Recently, I read Oliver Goldsmith's "Happiness In a Great Measure Dependen On Constitution," which, when talking about how to resist pain, he said, "... the first method is to forget our troubles, and the next method is to hide our troubles; fighting with misfortune, we will definitely be injured in the conflict. The only way to achieve victory is to escape."</p>
<p>What he calls "escape" is to forget or hide the pain. In fact, whether or not one can forget is not up to them, and hiding is just deceiving oneself. The pain is still accumulated in the heart, and one is still suffering and seeking a way to vent and get rid of it.</p>
<p>This morning, looking out the window, I saw my neighbor whipping a young maid. Just as the little girl cried loudly in pain, the stern mistress said, "Don't cry!" I thought for the child that she was unable to forget the humiliation and physical pain she had suffered. And "hiding" it was of no use to her at all. Indeed, she cried again in the end! But what followed the cry was another roar of "Don't cry!" and whipping!</p>
<p>This miserable world!</p>
<h3>Regret</h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>Like sharks cannot live without the sea, I, who grew up in a tea-drinking land, am always looking for places to drink tea. In Nanjing, Yuhuatai is one of the places I often go to drink tea.</p>
<p>One time, after sitting and drinking enough, I walked out of the teahouse and went up along the winding path. At the top, I saw a place where there was no one, as if it was a forgotten solitary grave, standing there alone and desolate. My direction of advance was focused on that side. Just as I was going up that slope, I suddenly heard shouts from behind. The sound disturbed my focused steps. I couldn't hear what they were shouting. But because they were shouting so fiercely, I couldn't help but stop and turn around to investigate. When I turned back, I saw a soldier standing on the opposite hill, holding his gun flat in both hands, in the pose of about to pull the trigger. It seemed that my body or part of it was the target of his soon-to-be-fired bullet.</p>
<p>"If you go any further, I'll shoot you!" the soldier roared.</p>
<p>At this time, I was surprised to see that the soldier's shouting was indeed directed at me. I looked puzzledly at the small house at the end of the hill I wanted to go to.</p>
<p>"Still looking! Do you want to be cannon fodder?" the soldier warned and questioned, as if he didn't understand either.</p>
<p>"Oh, so there is a cannon there. If I go, I will be 'cannon fodder'." I woke up and thoughtfully descended the slope I had climbed. I also paid attention to see if I had overlooked signs like "Fortress Area, No Entry" on the side of the road. But there were none. "What if I hadn't turned back just now!" I thought again; "If I hadn't turned back just now, no, perhaps I would have reached the other shore of life. A realm completely different from my current one?"</p>
<p>No; I didn't want to commit suicide. It's just that taking life so unknowingly, or even suffering some small injuries, always feels like a more meaningful thing, although if that were really the case, someone might calmly say that it was a stupid thing to walk to such a dangerous place as a fortress without thinking.</p>
<p>Yes, I regret my nosy head for once.</p>
<h3>Ramblings from a Humble Cottage</h3>
<p>— Zizhan</p>
<p>(Thirty-Seven) Time to Rest</p>
<p>Yesterday (May 27th), a small Shanghai newspaper published a short article titled "It is Said," written by a woman claiming to be Ms. Yunying. It roughly said, "Freedom Talk once declared that it would accept public submissions... Even Mr. Zizhan's, the stinky and rotten gentleman of the eighteenth century, posthumous work, Ramblings from a Humble Cottage, is published above. Alas, Zizhan, such works, time to rest." After I finished reading it, I couldn't help but exclaim, "Ms. Yunying! Such works, I am not yet willing to rest. My writing has no great meaning, it's just for eating. To hold me accountable for a famous mountain cause, how dare I? To call it stinky and rotten, I am still too humble to accept. Someone scolded me for being incompetent, I respectfully thanked them and said, I am indeed incompetent, what is there to be lower than? Someone scolded me for not being revolutionary, I also respectfully thanked them and said, why revolution? I have no comrades. Someone ridiculed me for being outdated, I laughed and replied, I have already landed. Someone ridiculed me for being old-fashioned, I also laughed and said, I am already old-fashioned for the winter. Yet another person criticized me for having a musty brain, I said, for a person to be musty, it's not just the brain. Now Ms. Yunying says that I am an eighteenth-century person, but in fact, I seek to be a person of the age of Wu Huai, a person of the age of Ge Tian, but I cannot obtain it. A talks about the materialistic view of history, saying it is a panacea; B talks about the people's livelihood view of history, saying it can eliminate all diseases; I talk about the eating view of history, it's just everyday food. My teaching is not for the high name of a university professor, it's just for cheating food. My writing is not to call myself an author, it's just for cheating food. I certainly do not wish to know what era I was born in, Qin? Han? Or modern times? Let others decide."</p>
<h3>Carrot Hair</h3>
<p>— Written by Jules Renaro, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Like Brutus (continued)</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic: How is that? You made such a loud speech, your face flushed, waving your fists, almost shouting so that the whole village could hear, and you still say you didn't say anything! Say that sentence again and let everyone listen.</p>
<p>Carrot Hair: There's no need to say it again. Let it go, Mom.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic: Say it, say it, who were you talking about just now; who exactly were you talking about?</p>
<p>Carrot Hair: You wouldn't understand this person, Mom.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic: That's exactly why I want you to say it. I ask you to clear your head a little bit, and then obey my words.</p>
<p>Carrot Hair: Okay, I'll say it! Mom, just now I was chatting with Dad, and Dad gave me some kind advice. Because I wanted to express my gratitude to Dad, I don't know where the idea came from, but I actually made a promise in front of Dad, and quoted the words of that Roman called Brutus...</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic: Bah, you're talking nonsense. I ask you to repeat that sentence you said just now in the same tone, word for word. I feel that what I'm asking for isn't anything extraordinary, and you really can consider your mother's feelings and do it.</p>
<p>Felix: Can I repeat it for him, Mom?</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic: No, let him say it first, then you say it, and then we'll compare. Say it, Carrot Hair, hurry up.</p>
<p>Carrot Hair said in a voice that was about to cry, stuttering.</p>
<p>"Oh… integrity… you… are… just… a… noun…"</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic: There's really no way. This thing can't be said no matter what. He would rather be beaten than make his mother happy.</p>
<p>Felix: Listen, Mom, he said it like this… (He turned his eyes around, casting a provocative look.) "If I don't get first place on my essay," (He puffed out his cheeks and stomped his feet on the ground.) "I can write like Brutus…" (He raised his arms.) "Oh, integrity!" (He put down his arms.) "You are just a noun!" That's what he said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic: Very good, learned it perfectly! I congratulate you, Carrot Hair, but you insisted on not repeating it, which is really a pity for me, because imitation is ultimately not as good as the original.</p>
<p>Felix: But, Carrot Hair, did Brutus actually say this? Isn't this what Cato said?</p>
<p>Carrot Hair: I believe it was definitely Brutus who said it. The book also said... "Afterwards, he threw himself on the sword in his friend's hand and committed suicide."</p>
<p>Elesdin: Carrot Hair is right. I still remember that Brutus pretended to be crazy and stuffed gold into his cane.</p>
<p>Carrot Hair: No, Sister, you're mixed up. You've mixed up the Brutus I'm talking about with another person.</p>
<p>Elesdin: But I believe it won't be wrong. I can guarantee you that what Ms. Sophie taught us about history will never be worse than what your public middle school teacher taught.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic: That's irrelevant. Don't argue. The most important thing is that we have to have a Brutus in our family, and we already have one now. Thanks to Carrot Hair's efforts, we can make people envy us! We don't even know how glorious it is to have this. Now you can look at this new Brutus. He speaks Latin like a bishop, but he refuses to give a second mass to the deaf. Turn him over and look at him from the front, the new clothes he put on today already have stains, and look at him from the back, his pants are already torn. Heavens, where did he run off to again? No, let me beat the Carrot Hair who has become Brutus and show you! Young beast, get lost!</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Interbank Rate Varies Between Morning and Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign interbank rate suddenly varied between the morning and afternoon sessions, with the morning rate at five points and the afternoon rate at three points. This was the first time since the foreign interbank rate was adopted that the morning and afternoon rates differed on the same day, as usually the rate is the same for both sessions. Regarding banks, the banks on the Bund had a holiday closure on the day before yesterday due to the Dragon Boat Festival, which coincided with a Sunday, so they had to make up for the holiday closure yesterday. However, the Central Bank and the Customs Office were open as usual, and the Chinese banks did not make up for the holiday either. It is estimated that they received more than 600,000 yuan in ticket payments and about 2 million yuan in various freight, tax, and miscellaneous payments. Due to the holiday closure the day before yesterday, the amount of money collected by the money shops for foreign public orders increased, with a total of more than 43 million yuan, more than 400,000 yuan in remittances from various routes, and 200,000 yuan in remittances from customers. In the interbank ticket trading, the morning session had more than 4.7 million yuan in transfers and 780,000 yuan in new transactions, the afternoon session had more than 400,000 yuan in transactions, and the small general association had more than 500,000 yuan in transactions. Banknote inflows and outflows amounted to more than 1.1 million yuan. In addition, the total amount exchanged at the clearing house on the 29th was 2,513,846.93 yuan in silver dollars. Among them, the Bund banks were closed for a holiday, so there was no exchange of silver dollars. The total amount of silver dollars remitted was 2,513,846.93 yuan.</p>
<h3>Both Jiangsu and Guangdong Coins Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangsu small silver coin was 854.5 yuan in the morning session and 853 yuan in the afternoon session. Although there was a small difference of 1.5 yuan between the two sessions, it seemed to have risen by more than 2 yuan compared to the price at the end of last week. The trading volume was 5,000 coins in the morning session and 7,000 coins in the afternoon session. The Guangdong small silver coin was 778.5 yuan in the morning session and 777.5 yuan in the afternoon session. As a result, it was also 2.5 yuan higher than the previous day. The trading volume was 75,000 coins in the morning session and 45,000 coins in the afternoon session. Copper coins remained unchanged at 317,500 coins. The trading volume was 38,100 strings, with a total value of 12,000 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3>The Beiyang Coins Will be Used Directly From Now On</h3>
<p>In the past, the most commonly used silver coins were the Yuan head and Sun Yat-sen coins. Among other old coins, such as the British coin, Jiangsu coin, and Guangdong dragon coin, there was liquidity, but the Beiyang coin was not very applicable in the market. Money shops often had to charge a discount, which was very inconvenient. After the unification of silver coins this time, measures should be taken to curb the miscellaneous foreign coins that require a discount. Therefore, the Chinese and foreign banking associations recently held a joint meeting and, with the consent of the leaders of the money industry, decided to use the Beiyang coin directly. All money shops and banks should use this coin directly when opening boxes and encountering it in their inventory, without the need for exchange, to facilitate convenience. It was announced yesterday that a notice has been posted in the financial market to inform the entire society.</p>
<h3>Large, Long-Term Loans at 625</h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 29th. Large, long-term loans at 625. The recent price is 18 pence 9375, and the forward price is 19 pence. The British-American exchange rate opened at 3 yuan 9 jiao 7 fen 25.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Peaceful Progress</p>
<p>Government Bonds Showed Weak Upward Momentum Last Week</p>
<p>| Increase from several jiao to two yuan |</p>
<p>From May 22nd to 27th last week, the bond market of the Chinese Securities Exchange was very tense. The mystery of Tianjin and Beijing was confusing, and after several weeks, it was finally broken on Wednesday last week. The short sellers were almost on the verge of desperation at this point, but their reaction did not affect the stop-loss limit, because the short sellers had prepared to some extent. Therefore, the escape of Tianjin and Beijing from the crisis was fortunate, and there was no violent storm. Only with the arrival of peaceful news, after the newspapers were published, the trend suddenly became strange and unpredictable, and the speculators were able to do their best. When the news spread throughout the market, it became calm and quiet. How the situation will change in the future depends on the negotiations. On Monday last week, the situation in Tianjin and Beijing was already felt to be imminent, and the situation in North China was extremely chaotic. Large investors even sold out, and the market price fell from 34 jiao to 1 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen. On Tuesday, according to newspaper reports, the atmosphere of peace seemed to be a bubble. The morning session even fell by 67 jiao, with a downward trend. Unexpectedly, at the close of the market, news of a ceasefire suddenly filled the market. For a time, the bulls were jubilant, and the short sellers were extremely panicked. The Northern Gang first rushed to cover their positions, and all gangs bravely bought in. In one session, the market price soared by 23 yuan. The trading volume was also very brisk, and the closing time in the afternoon was already 5 o'clock. The closing sale reached 9 o'clock. Because this day was the last day of the first half of May, the number of outstanding positions could not be reduced, and the trading volume reached more than 27.4 million, creating the highest trading volume record this year. On Wednesday, only the June session was being collected, and because the accounts on Tuesday were extremely confusing, there was one session in the morning and afternoon, and the market price rose slightly by half a yuan or so. On Thursday, the July futures session began to be traded, but the trading volume was greatly reduced, and the market price was slightly sluggish by about 4 jiao. On Friday, the delivery of the May futures was carried out, and trading was suspended for one day. On Saturday, because the preliminary peace had been completed, except for one or two large investors who still sold, the demand from others was still urgent, and the market price continued to rise by 34 jiao to 1 yuan 1 jiao. In summary, the market price rose from several jiao to 2 yuan for the whole week. The total trading volume was 72,948,000 yuan, including 38,000 yuan in spot goods. The futures stamp duty alone amounted to 17,175,000 yuan, the demobilization accounted for 12,450,000 yuan, the unified tax accounted for 10,150,000 yuan, the 19 customs duty accounted for 11,490,000 yuan, the 20-volume 20-customs duty accounted for 16,115,000 yuan, and the rest ranged from several hundred thousand to 230,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Yarn Prices Slightly Suppressed by Short Selling</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rose. However, the situation in overseas cotton industries is gradually improving. At the same time, various groups in the South China area are developing and purchasing cotton yarn briskly. The current yarn market appears quite favorable. However, sellers, due to the chaotic situation, are still short selling, which is suppressing the upward trend. Nevertheless, the actual demand has been stagnant for a long time, and there is concern that extreme stillness may lead to movement. If business continues, there could be a drastic change in the future. It is said that the prices of yarn from a certain country have risen by 200 yuan beyond the pass for all months.</p>
<p>People's Standard (Ren Biao) Falls and Rises Again: In the opening market of People's Standard, American cotton continued to rise, and there were many spot yarn transactions in Guangdong. However, the pressure from scattered short selling in the market was still heavy. As the Shen Xin factory has resumed operations, prices for various months fell by 7.8.9 jiao to 1 yuan. In the afternoon, it was reported that spot yarn transactions from the South continued to come in, and cloth prices have recently been rising. People's confidence increased, and prices for various months rose by 5.6.7.8 jiao to 1 yuan. The total volume of transactions for the day was 41,600 bales. Sales included Dafeng 2,400 bales, Lichang Yi 700 bales, Yichang 1,850 bales, Changfeng 1,500 bales, and Huachang 1,300 bales. Purchases included Mingde 1,000 bales, Ruida 1,250 bales, Renfeng 1,600 bales, Tonghe 1,050 bales, Xincheng 1,050 bales, and Senkang 900 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing Prices and Fluctuations, Account Balance: September 2010, Down 1, 46,950</p>
<p>June 1945, Down 4, 40,600 October 2017, Up 2, 42,750</p>
<p>July 1967, Up 3, 66,950 Total 257,850</p>
<p>August 1995, Up 4, 60,600</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Trading Opens with 3,000 Bales: The movement of spot yarn has suddenly become brisk, with significant activity in the Southern ports. It is estimated that various groups purchased a total of 3,000 bales throughout the day, with prices rising by 5 jiao. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 1,785 Shantou 5 Yunnan 420 Changsha 40 Nanjing 5</p>
<p>Inland 275 Datong 10 Ningbo 30 Sichuan 350 Peers 60</p>
<p>The flower market was sluggish in the morning due to scattered short selling, but the situation with foreign cotton remained favorable. New short sellers were still lacking. In the afternoon, Indian merchants purchased to cover their short positions, and the calculated silver price for foreign cotton rose by 1 yuan compared to yesterday. As a result, people's confidence tightened, and sellers became cautious. The selling price of spot cotton was quite high.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard (Zheng Biao) Sluggish in the Morning, Recovers in the Afternoon: In the opening market of Zheng Standard, buyers were lacking, and prices for various months fell by 1.5 jiao to 4 jiao. In the afternoon, Indian merchants covered their short positions, and sentiment turned upward, with prices for all months rising by 1.5 jiao to 3.5 jiao. The total volume of transactions for the day was 9,050 dan. Sales included Yichang 4,600 dan, Xincheng 5,400 dan, Gengfeng 5,400 dan, Dianji 1,800 dan, and Hengde 2,500 dan. Purchases included Renfeng 3,000 dan, Changfeng 5,600 dan, Yuanda 6,500 dan, Tonghe 2,900 dan, Yukang 2,000 dan, and Yiyu 1,900 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Closing Prices Compared to Previous Day, Account Balance: August 4750, Down 5, 149,900</p>
<p>June 4735, Down 5, 96,700 October 4645, Up 10, 98,600</p>
<p>July 4755, …, 141,600 Total 486,800</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Remains Firm: The situation with spot cotton remains firm. As foreign cotton prices are rising, people's confidence is increasing, and they are unwilling to compromise on prices. Therefore, transactions have not been brisk. The source of arrival was 302 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Tianjin American Cotton: 48.50, Imported by Hongshun Company, 200 Pieces, Delivered at Warehouse</p>
<p>Tianjin American Cotton: 49.00, Imported by Hengfeng Factory, 280 Pieces, Delivered to Factory</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton: 47.75, Imported by Zhenxin Factory, 140 Pieces, Delivered to Tin</p>
<h3>Indian and British Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>Bombay: Sales were very good last week. Speculators were actively buying futures. It is generally believed that Indian cotton prices are very cheap compared to American cotton prices. In addition, there is export demand from Europe, Japan, and even China, which has further strengthened people's confidence. The demand for White Rawxi cotton is unabated, and sales are very strong. Local yarn factories are improving due to the need for cloth. The weekly statistics are appended below (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>
<p>1932 1933</p>
<p>Cumulative receipts since September 1 1,754 2,122</p>

<p>Other places 25 47</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot sales were very brisk last week. Futures prices were mostly upward due to the implementation of the American rural relief plan. There was some selling during the week, but it was all absorbed. Market prices rose again at the weekend due to the decision by the United States to abandon the gold standard. Transactions in Egyptian cotton decreased, and prices fluctuated with American cotton.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Miscellaneous Notes on Silk Cocoons</h3>
<p>Mo Jia Xian Cocoons Yield 50%: In the Mo Jia Xian area of Jia County, the harvest of new cocoons is only about 50%. After four days on the market, the arrival of cocoons has been sluggish, and cocoon prices are expected to rise. Improved variety high-quality cocoons have opened at 32.3 yuan, and local variety cocoons at 27.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Tian Le Township's High-Quality Cocoons Fetch High Prices: In Tian Le Township and other places in Shao County, cocoon merchants have been weighing cocoons for a week. There are few high-quality cocoons on the market, and opening prices are rising. Foreign high-quality cocoons have opened at a maximum price of 40 yuan.</p>
<p>Heavy Rain in Lin City Leads to Fewer Arrivals: Cocoon merchants in Lin City, Changxing, have been weighing cocoons for three days. Due to heavy rain all night the day before yesterday, fewer goods arrived on the market the next day. High-quality cocoons were priced at 32 yuan by merchants such as Chengchang, and local cocoons at 25 yuan. The price ratio is still flat.</p>
<p>Shu Shan's High-Quality Cocoons See Gradual Price Increases: The improved cocoons produced in the Shu Shan area of Su County are of high quality and thick-bodied. Cocoon merchants are competing to purchase them. The highest price has risen to 41.2 yuan according to the Sima scale, with an average price of 33-34 yuan.</p>
<p>Wuxi Cocoon Merchants to Begin Weighing: The early silkworms in various cities and villages of Wuxi are forming cocoons on a large scale. Cocoon merchants are preparing to begin weighing. It is reported that around 50 cocoon merchants have registered to open for business in the entire county, all scheduled to open on June 1. A bumper harvest of new cocoons is expected, but silkworm rearing has decreased.</p>
<p>Stock of Chen Factory Silk Gradually Dwindling: The stock of old silk and cocoons from previous years in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is gradually dwindling since the Ministry of Finance and Industry dispatched personnel to organize the consolidation and promotion committees and issued 3 million yuan in silk public bonds to encourage exports. It is estimated that the previous Chen factory silk stored in Shanghai is less than 3,000 bales, and efforts are being made to sell it off before the subsidy deadline at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Rayon Sells Clean, Prices Firm: Sales of rayon in the local market are still difficult to progress. Yesterday, only Hangzhou silk merchants purchased 13 boxes of Degi's first and second grade futures for this month, priced from 168 yuan to 161.25 yuan net.</p>
<p>Ban Zhuang Silk Sales Still Not Weak: Various manufacturers are actively selling old silk yellow and white factory silk, and transactions are still lively. It is estimated that Xinfu and others purchased 60 bales of white factory silk, 61 bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk, 4 bales of yellow reeling silk, and 6 bales of yellow coarse silk. Prices remain stable.</p>
<h3>New Tea Weighing in Wuyuan is Not Brisk</h3>
<p>Since Wuyuan green tea opened at a new price of 40 to 45 yuan on the 19th, various companies have been negotiating prices based on the market. It was expected that someone would soon open for weighing and conclude transactions. However, most small households are clinging to this market price and are unwilling to sell cheaply. While the two sides were in a stalemate, the bad news of low new prices for Shanghai black tea came. Considering the poor market conditions for both black and green tea, tea companies were timid and hesitant to proceed. They still hoped to lower the mountain price of 40 yuan. In recent days, only Dongxiang Xitou has opened at 70 yuan, Shacheng at 59 yuan, Beixiang Liwaiyao at 40 yuan, Guqifang at 15 yuan, Tantou at 43 yuan, and Xixiang at 38 yuan. There are still not many others who have opened for weighing without prices. Companies that suffered heavy losses last year and those that are financially sound are mostly watching and not proceeding. Tea assistants have been sent out to collect scales and return to the villages. The coldness of the market is truly rare.</p>
<h3>Xiushui Black Tea Production Suffers Losses</h3>
<p>In Xun, the price offered for Xiushui's early black tea ranges from 700 to 1,000 cash per catty, equivalent to 30 yuan in foreign currency per dan, a decrease of more than 20 yuan compared to last year. The cost of the first batch of boxed tea is around 100 yuan. The mountain price has opened at only 20 to 10 yuan. Because the number of tea companies in the mountains has decreased this year, there is no competition to inflate prices, so mountain prices have been immediately lowered. The production of Xiutong tea this year has suffered significant losses, reaching only 40-50% of last year's production. The second batch of boxed tea from various companies is already being shipped. Because the tea from the third batch is coarse and old, few companies are processing it. Companies with small amounts of tea can complete their operations within the month. In total, the output of boxed tea from Xiudi this year will not exceed 3,000 to 4,000 boxes. The shortfall in tea output is significantly different from the past. (May 23)</p>
<h3>Qimen Tea Reaches a New Low Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the road for Qimen, Fuliang, and Jiande black tea and Yingde Zhuang was slightly active. However, the British telegrams set extremely strict price limits. The cost of the first batch of goods was relatively high, and negotiations between Chinese and foreign parties were difficult to approach. The goods traded were mostly the second batch of tea recently arrived, totaling 2,124 boxes of black tea and 445 boxes of green tea. The market price for Qimen tea has already opened to the lowest price of 80 yuan, and the situation remains unfavorable. After a drop last week, Zun'an Tuzhuang Zhenmei green tea was not opened. The Tunxi New Tribute was also lowered by the Baitouzhuang Yu Jiang foreign firm, with a price of 100 yuan, only 85% lower than last year. The overall trend of the tea market is said to be better for green tea than black tea.</p>
<h3>Ningzhou Tea Market Depressed</h3>
<p>The Ning black tea of the past was once famous, dominating the tea market. Recently, it has almost disappeared and is barely surviving. The tea market here is showing a depressed atmosphere again this year. The following is based on the findings of the investigation: The tea companies in Xiushui and Wuning counties in Tiaoshui County include Jichang, Guangxinglong, Zhonghechang, Zhentailong, Hengfengshun, Yuanfengxiang, Shengfa, Yuanfeng Yiji, Yuji, Shengji, Jinfengchang, Yutaiheng, Hengfenglong, Zhengdayuan (the above sell to Shanghai Zhuangkou), Chunji, Tongyu, Hengchun, Gonghelong, and Wusongji (the above sell to Nanchang Zhuangkou), a total of 20 companies. Except for Jichang and Guangxinglong, which also make green tea boxes and baskets, the rest specialize in making black tea baskets. Those in Wuning County include Shendasheng, Huangwanshun, Tangzhengxing, Fangmingchun, Yitaifu, Yuxingxiang, Gongshengchang, and Qingchanglong, a total of eight companies that specialize in making black tea baskets and sell them to Shanghai. There are also more than ten other companies, including Shiyuxing, Dajixiang, Qianheyu, Chunsheng, Yihefu, Qianyulong, Rongtaixiang, Yufulong, Ruifenglong, Deji, Yuanhexing, and Shichanglong, distributed in various towns of Xiuwu. In total, the tea that has been imported by various companies in Xiushui this year includes 832 pieces in baskets, 6,085 pieces in bags, and 14 pieces in boxes. As for Wuning, the exact number has not yet been found, so it is not listed.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Xiushui Tea Industry Improvement Farm</h3>
<p>The Tea Industry Improvement Farm jointly organized by the Central Agricultural Experiment of the Ministry of Industry and the Shanghai and Wuhan Commodity Inspection Bureaus is located at the old site of the Ning Tea Revitalization Company in Baipengkeng, Xiushui. The company was originally founded by Chen, a giant merchant in the tea industry, with a large scale and owning more than 2,000 mu of vast tea mountains. However, due to poor management, it suffered losses every year, amounting to hundreds of thousands. Recently, due to local unrest, there was no intention to continue, so the Ministry of Industry leased and took over the establishment of the Tea Industry Improvement Farm, and appointed Yu Haiqing as the person in charge. After receiving the order, Yu arrived at the farm with technical staff in late last month to handle the handover and preparation matters. As it was the tea season, on the one hand, they worked day and night to manufacture. Currently, the first batch of products from the farm has been manufactured into dozens of boxes, with very good quality. The shape, color, and aroma far exceed Qihong. It is said that if it were not affected by time and machinery, the results would be more than this. The batch of tea leaves will be shipped to Shanghai soon, and the second batch is currently being rushed, which can also be packed and shipped out within about a week.</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Rice Prices Rise by More Than a Dime After the Festival</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 30 to 40 sources, and although the market situation was that the Dragon Boat Festival had passed, the appetite was not yet strong. However, sellers were determined to make a profit, and the market price increased by more than one chi. The Wei Hai Wei gang was preparing to move nearly 1,000 packages, and because the source of thin rice was not large, the market price also increased. In short, the prices of Su Tong gang and Nangang Qing Yong Song Si Xi Lian Guang were high by more than a dime. Du Yangjian also had a good angle, only Yin Bian Yuan, because the season has passed, the market is now soft and tired.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) In the past two days, there were more than 30 boats from various routes in Hexia. The market's white japonica rice was slightly active and rose nearly one chi. Thin rice arrived continuously, but there was only zero appetite and the price was tired. Early rice was lacking, and the arrival of Yang Du Bu Jian was not strong, and sales were also average, and the price was stable. Ke Jian had no honor or disgrace, Yin Yuan was lacking in goods, and Bai Yuan was slightly tired.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Sales Are Active, Prices Rise by One Dime</h3>
<p>| Yang Rice Price Increases by One Dime |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian market was quite lively. Because the Fuzhou gang had a very good appetite, but the arrival was not strong, the goods were firm, and the hoarders were guarding. People's hearts were upward, and the prices of Jiangxi and Hunan rice all rose by about five to six cents to a dime. Throughout the day, 1,000 packages of Jiangxi Machine Late were sold at a price of 8 yuan and 2.5 jiao, 40 packages of Machine Yuan were sold at a price of 9.5 yuan, 130 packages of Machine Early were sold at a price of 7 yuan and 6 jiao, 450 packages of Hunan Machine Oil were sold at a price of 8 yuan and 8 jiao, 255 packages of Coarse Red were sold at a price of 7 yuan and 3 jiao, 300 packages of Jing were sold at a price of 7 yuan, 1 jiao, and 3 cents, 600 packages of Wuhu Machine Xian were sold at a price of 7 yuan and 8 jiao, 300 packages of Jiangbei Xian rice were sold at a price of 7 yuan, 4 jiao, and 3 cents. The 300 packages of Jiangxi Machine Late and Wu Xian were purchased by Wen Chou, while the foreign grains were defended by foreign merchants and the hoarders called for a dime increase, resulting in no transactions.</p>
<h3>Period Flour is Close to Pingyuan Pine</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for each month were stable. Although the price reported by Yangbu had risen by about seven or eight jiao, the people's hearts in the market were very little shaken. As the delivery for this month was approaching, the factories still had a lot of silkworm codes, and the actual sales customers were not enthusiastic. It was rumored that Wuxi factories were continuously issuing files in the long term. Although the number was not strong, it was inevitably suppressed by the customers in the light. Therefore, the market conditions for each board were always hovering. Until the afternoon opening, the recent period was still stable, and the long-term period gradually loosened. Because some factories had a lot of hedging business, they took in recent ones, but still sold in the long term. The number of periods was more than the intake, so the market atmosphere was less lively. Observing the new wheat harvest, the difference between rising and falling depends on how the year is. As a result, this month and June were 2.5 li smaller than the previous week, July was unchanged, August was 2.5 li smaller, September was 7.5 li smaller, and October was 5 li smaller.</p>
<p>There was Chen goods for sale in the spot wheat market yesterday, which came from Huaiyuan and was priced at 4 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 cents, and was taken by Huafeng.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Market Turns Active</h3>
<p>The source of soybean cake surged, and because it was seen that the sales stomach could gradually expand after the festival, the industry was very strong. Yesterday, the market traded about 20,000 pieces. The goods holders in the oil market were very firm, and the market was gradually rising. The atmosphere in the bean market was still strong. Yesterday, 2,000 packages of Hankou Xinyangzhou beans were shipped, and the factory took a batch because the price was cheap, opening at 5 yuan and 3 jiao.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>White Tung Oil Suddenly Turns Upward</p>
<p>White tung oil has been suddenly tired and tired in the past half month, exhausting all the abilities of rabbits and turtles. However, yesterday, the Han telegram suddenly saw an upward trend. Each number in the wood port was at the bottom, and when they heard the news, they all competed for office by telegram, so there must be a vitality to watch today. According to yesterday's Han telegram, the old brand per dan was 17 yuan, and the foreign village was still 22 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 cents.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Coarse Sand White Falls by One Dime</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market tended to be flat and tired due to the lack of transactions. The association's planned 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods were 20 yuan and 3 jiao, with only 100 packages traded. 89 Hechi 16 yuan and 2 jiao, slightly out of stock. Taikoo Chebai had no big ups and downs, and the daily price was 21 yuan and 7.5 jiao, CW mark 21 yuan and 6 jiao, DY mark 21 yuan and 4.5 jiao, HX mark 21 yuan and 3 jiao. Chang Yuhang opened RA cotton Hebai at 22 yuan, Guangju Factory, the word 20 yuan and 7 cents and a half, the word 20 yuan and a dime. The sand plus Guangbao was 21 yuan. The number of the board opened by the gang was less than 300 packages, and the price was 12 yuan, 2 jiao, and a half to 12 yuan. Guangzhicheng Xinghao and others opened more than 300 packages of Guangzhouyang, priced at 15 yuan and 3 jiao. The rest of Zhengmian Chi and Hainan Chi were only called discs and did not open.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Neirong Chuanbang's Appetite Recovers</p>
<p>Chuanbang's purchase of neirong has always been the strongest of the customer gangs. However, since this year, the gang's appetite has been blunt. Since the Sichuan Road, business has not yet recovered. Recently, there has been a slow start, and its needs are not asked much. Chongqing needs Yusha neirong, white bibi, white straight through, French neirong, Balene, yarn oblique, cloth, yellow Kebuo, etc. Order goods, while Chengdu's gang reversed the flower bibi, straight through neirong, and even colorful and clipped cold weather felt neirong in the autumn and winter seasons. It is also asked or handed over. The difference in the road lies mostly in the relationship between the road.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>More Than 15,000 Boxes of Tinplate Arrive</p>
<p>Yesterday, 15,600 boxes of British tinplate were loaded into the new Taikoo Stack in Pudong, including 90 pounds, 180 pounds, 200 pounds and other colors. However, the oil company has 6,000 boxes, and there are also more than 1,000 boxes of goods for Tianjin and Hankou. The remaining 8,000 boxes are all orders from local counterparts.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Blood</h3>
<p>— Ox</p>
<p>Blood is truly an ominous thing. Bloodshed in Shanghai can be said to happen every day, and today's special bloodbath commemoration on Nanjing Road is enough to show that blood is an ominous sign. Extending this by hundreds of steps, the bloodletting of January 28th, the bloodbath of September 18th, and even the recent bloodshed in Peiping and Tianjin, the bloodshed between Liu and Deng in Sichuan, our country's ardent sons, I don't know how many heads have been thrown, how much hot blood has been thickened. When you talk about blood, you really can't help but feel cold.</p>
<p>Blood is originally an ominous thing. Historically, when a country has many events and is about to stir up war, there are often reports of "blood rain" and "red rivers." Heaven first warns of it. Especially in recent years, changes have occurred repeatedly. For example, near Longmen last year, the Yellow River suddenly narrowed, and treasures, rice, and grain were turned up in the river. These kinds of changes are naturally not good omens. According to a Shantou telegram, a rainbow circled the sun in Chao'an for half an hour, and the water in the Chao River turned red, and the sand and mud boiled up, turbid like blood. From Zhuzhen Mountain to Jishuitacheng, people changed to drinking well water. It took twenty hours to put it out. Isn't this a kind of blood report? The blood cases in the north are not dry, and the blood signs in the south have appeared again. It's true that the bloodshed won't stop.</p>
<p>However, people in Shanghai's lower society often regard money as blood. For example, they say, "I originally wanted to treat guests today, but there is no blood in the purse," or "So-and-so's blood is Mecca Mecca, but unfortunately, they are unwilling to pluck a hair." They often use blood to replace money. At first, I didn't understand. Money is auspicious and precious, while blood is the most terrible and miserable thing. It seems inappropriate to compare money to blood.</p>
<p>Thinking carefully, there is a great truth in it. The human body's blood is originally the most precious. If a person has no blood, then their heart is dead. Money is also the most precious thing to people. If people have no money, they cannot live. Therefore, what is miserable and terrible is blood, and what is most precious is also blood. What is lovely and precious is money, and what is terrible and miserable is also money. Therefore, comparing blood to money is truly an apt and clever metaphor.</p>
<p>Heroes on the road draw sharp knives for a few yuan, causing bloodshed. Imperialists take airplanes and cannons and run rampant everywhere, also causing bloodshed. Therefore, money is the price of blood, and blood is also the price of money. If money is used improperly, it is indeed a waste. If it is not used when it should be used, it is also "dying wronged."</p>
<p>It is the same with blood. If it is not shed when it should not be shed, it will not flourish. If it is not shed when it should be shed, how can it be "living in humiliation"?</p>
<p>If blood capital is sacrificed and money is won, there is no loss for both sides. If blood capital is sacrificed and no money is won, it is a true sacrifice of blood capital for a big sale. And on the customer side, the goods are obtained, but no money is paid. Where can such a bargain be found? Therefore, bleeding without getting a price is a true "death of injustice," and getting a price without bleeding is only "robbery."</p>
<h3>It's Hard for "God"!</h3>
<p>— Ai Lian</p>
<p>In a city where people are in a panic, news comes that the soldiers are approaching the city. The tragic and painful past images are trembling in everyone's hearts. If the facts are about to be revealed, what else can comfort the heart? "Um! Pray, or pray to God for help!" So the whole family ran to the statue of the Virgin, and the elder began to pray... "Heavenly Father! We thank you for the food, clothing, and shelter you have given us; our souls can be resurrected, and our sins can be washed away by your precious blood, but now we sincerely kneel and ask Heavenly Father to grant us peace and security. The Japanese soldiers are approaching the city, and the tragic tragedy is about to begin. Although sinful humans should suffer some torment, God! May you forgive them seventy times seven times, as the Bible says. We ask God to grant peace and security, so that sinful people have the opportunity to renew themselves, and use your spirit of love to influence the enemy's atrocities, so that the people in our city can live in peace, looking up to Heavenly Father to accept our sincere prayers, Amen."</p>
<p>In a brightly lit city, news came that the Chinese soldiers were safely withdrawing, and there would be satisfactory hope in the near future. Everyone's faces were filled with pride and joy. In the preparatory meeting for the celebration, the chairman said; Let us pray to God, by the grace of God, we will have the help of our warriors, so that our celebration can begin today. Comrades! Let us pray, so many people knelt down, and the prayer began··</p>
<p>"Heavenly Father! We thank you for giving our courage, for giving our nation a glorious history, for expanding our territory to the three eastern provinces of China. Here we want to pray that God will give our warriors great courage and strength, and quickly flatten the three eastern provinces of China, completing our wishes."</p>
<p>God, in the dark, received two prayers at the same time. God seemed too embarrassed to answer. Under the urgency of these two prayers, wisdom came from the middle, so he said to the first person with a soothing tone...</p>
<p>"Here I allow your prayers to grant you peace and security, but you must remember the saying 'Love your enemies.' You should open the city gates to love your enemies. This is the peace I give you."</p>
<p>God turned around and answered the second prayer...</p>
<p>"Remember the saying 'Love your enemies.' When your enemies open the city to love you, you should also love them."</p>
<p>It was difficult for God to come up with a perfect solution to solve all the problems. Hallelujah! Long live God!</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Poems</h3>
<p>Reports say that Wu Peifu lives in peace, not talking about state affairs, but only chanting poems. His one-verse poem about current affairs is full of grief and indignation. His style is no less than his "Great Flood Poem" of the year. Following the original rhyme, I have composed two verses. - Xi He Master</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Why not watch the plains burn across the bank, why must sincerity drain the chest and liver, just wait more than fifty years later, (Dr. Hu's quote on frugality) chickens and dogs ascend to lick the alms bowl dan.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Fu Wei's aura, how can he bear to look back, riches and honor are floating clouds, sighing at the rat's liver, past events have become a dream of plantain deer, how can he bear to rekindle the cold stove dan.</p>
<p>If the meaning is unfinished, one verse will be repeated</p>
<p>Former person</p>
<p>Not talking about state affairs, just chanting poems (using the title of a certain newspaper on the 25th), it is like a general entering school, lonely old garden, shedding tears in vain, why should he reorganize the Luoyang division.</p>
<p>Since the poem is completed, Wu Chenjun will compose it even more</p>
<p>One verse is still in the original rhyme</p>
<p>What is the matter with the general just watching by the side, just chanting through the sun to comfort the liver, hate to lose a horse to this day, Yan Zhao is difficult to learn from Yan Dan,</p>
<h3>A Sketch of Several Typical Characters in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ju</p>
<p>(1) Celebrities and Tycoons</p>
<p>Their clothes are so shabby, yet their faces are generally greasy with fat. This is the portrait of a celebrity and tycoon. At first glance, they look just like waiters and errand boys. Therefore, they sometimes inevitably suffer the ridicule of the clueless waiters at banquets. However, celebrities and tycoons have a heaven-defying cultivation: "A gentleman does not argue about petty matters." It doesn't matter. Just explain to the blind waiter so he doesn't look down on people with shabby clothes next time. This precisely highlights their "magnanimous" demeanor, scaring the waiter into scurrying away like a rat, banging his head several times, and begging for forgiveness. And the general bystanders are in awe and praise endlessly. These celebrities and tycoons have a transcendent influence in Shanghai, tightly connected with the authorities of both Chinese and foreigners. If there are disturbances in the market, or talk of reforming the municipality, the rights and obligations of the common people are spun around in their palms. Their cars speed through the center of the street, because they rarely have time to go for a drive. They are all high-class Chinese, the big shots on the Shanghai stage.</p>
<p>(2) Western-Suited Youths</p>
<p>In Shanghai, when you mention Western-suited youths, they are as numerous as tadpoles in the rice paddies in February and March, and they jump and shout like frogs in the rice paddies in March and April. This group is extremely complex. There are young masters, company clerks, civil servants, college students, and gigolos. But under the uniform cover of Western suits (note: they are not all wearing blue suits), no one can tell their identity and duties. They have plenty of leisure time and money. They stroll in rows along the streets, which not only contributes to the hustle and bustle of the market, but is also an indispensable decoration of the metropolis. Going from amusement parks to parks, or stepping into the towering revolving door, is their daily routine. But there are also a small number who are diligently studying at the book stalls or beside the roadside news boards. Staring at the legs of passing women seems to be their only duty when they are strolling around. In Shanghai, which spans dozens of miles of foreign concessions, this group of characters is indeed indispensable.</p>
<p>(3) Modern Misses</p>
<p>Things grow by "inheriting and generating" each other. With so many Western-suited youths, there also needs to be a group of modern misses, matching yin and yang, the two sexes vying for beauty. Thus, there are so many misses, stepping on high-heeled leather shoes, galloping like horses to show off their ability to dress up. There are daughters of noble families, socialites, dancers, and female students. And so on down the line, there are female gangsters, prostitutes, and women from the salted meat shops. The wallets tightly held in their hands are so mysterious, filled with small square mirrors, lipsticks, perfume, face powder, movie brochures, and admission tickets. Their eyes don't wander, but they also don't dislike men staring at them. When passing by large companies, they will stop for a moment to see if there are any new clothing and accessories on display.</p>
<p>(4) Idle Young Men</p>
<p>They wear clothes like young masters, with the cuffs folded back halfway, silk socks, and embroidered satin shoes. That wide silk trouser belt nearly sweeps the knees. Three or five of them gather together, and they are either talking about which rotten goods are alluring, or how they scrounged up the rice for yesterday's dinner. Sometimes they take out a few copper coins from their pockets, and everyone throws them at a target. It is a way to pass the time, even though the stakes are not high. When a strange woman walks by, they follow her and offer their flattery in a couple of words, embarrassing the woman enough to call the police. This often happens on Avenue Edward VII and Yu Yuan Road. When the police arrive, they scatter in all directions, fleeing for their lives. Sometimes they will spit two mouthfuls of thick phlegm on your clean clothes for no reason. If you protest, they will say that you stepped on their embroidered satin shoes and invite you to a teahouse. And so, they have a place to spend the day.</p>
<p>(5) Nannies and Maids</p>
<p>The alley entrance and the tiger stove are where they set up shop to discuss right and wrong. With a twist of their hips, we can hear a lot of valuable news from their wrinkled lips: which young mistress has a wild man to accompany her during the day; which family is truly wealthy, changing a dozen sets of new clothes a day; which nanny is the most troubled, with many tasks and little extra money, and when she goes to buy groceries, the young mistress follows her, not allowing a single copper coin to be pocketed; while another only needs to greet the guests during mahjong games to get a thick stack of silver coins; and which young mistress is the most fierce, blinding the nanny in one eye and breaking the young maid's nose. Although they are all busy people, they can still spend an hour or two gossiping. Sometimes, if they have a lover nearby, the conversation will turn to sweet nothings. This is also a typical character in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Saving the Nation with Tears</h3>
<p>People cry because of distress. Distress comes either from strong external oppression or from deep internal stimulation, which cannot be suppressed, so they resort to crying. This is a temporary or emotional impulse, and its meaning is also very great. On a small scale, it can arouse people's sympathy, and on a large scale, it can save the country from decline.</p>
<p>When Lin Daiyu quarrels with someone, she secretly sobs alone in her room. When Baoyu sees her, he quickly finds some gentle words to comfort her. When Miss X fails to win first place in a race, tears well up in her eyes. The students quickly take out their handkerchiefs to dry her tears. This is how crying can arouse people's sympathy.</p>
<p>"The wife of Qi Liang of Hua Zhou was good at crying for her husband, thereby changing the customs of the country. Wu Zixu attacked Chu with the Wu army, and Shen Baoxu entered Qin to beg for troops, leaning against the courtyard wall and crying for seven days, so the Duke of Qin sent generals to settle his country's difficulties." This is how crying can save the country from decline.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the entire country has regarded saving the nation as the most urgent task. All kinds of "saving the nation with beauty," "saving the nation with dancing," "saving the nation with the Kalachakra Tantra Dharma Assembly," "saving the nation with aviation," as well as "telegrams" and "protests," have been popular for a time. As a result, the people's spirit has waned, the great powers are watching, and the enemy troops are penetrating deeper. The national salvation strategies, which were originally aimed at relieving the national crisis, have achieved such results, and one cannot help but cry out in unison: "This road is impassable!" We should change to another path! No one has yet mentioned "saving the nation with tears." I am not talented, but I will promote it to join in the fun.</p>
<p>The tears we need are not the tears of children like Lin Daiyu and Miss X, but the bloody tears like those of Shen Baoxu and the wife of Qi Liang. Our diplomats, in today's "weak nations have no diplomacy," are wasting their breath by arguing. It is better to go to Roosevelt or Stalin and cry bitterly, begging them to settle our national crisis. Shen Baoxu cried for seven days before the Duke of Qin was willing to send troops. Even if our diplomats cry for another seven days, they should not be impatient, as long as they can achieve the goal of sending troops.</p>
<p>It is feared that even with foreign aid, if we do not make efforts ourselves, the effect will be very small! Therefore, we should also send a few people to cry to the generals who possess large armies and love to play civil wars, crying until their hearts ache, and they will have no choice but to bite the bullet and go to the front line.</p>
<p>"Nothing is more sorrowful than the death of the heart." The general young masters and mistresses are drunk in dance halls every day, and the national crisis has long been put behind them. It is very difficult to awaken them with gentle words or vicious scolding! Sometimes it even causes them to feel resentful. Therefore, tears must be used to cleanse their minds.</p>
<p>Tears can indeed move people. Compatriots! Why not put it into practice?</p>

<h3>Shop Clerk Correspondence</h3>
<p>Several Legal Issues</p>
<p>Mr. Editor, my legal advisor in duty, I hereby ask you to indicate the following two matters of legal responsibility with the utmost sincerity, I am extremely grateful.</p>
<p>(1) I am a small staff member in a large company, and my monthly income is only enough to make ends meet, but the responsibilities I bear are not light. My family has an ancestral hall, with about 400 acres of ancestral property, which was managed by my grandfather. Due to poor management, it gradually decreased to about 200 acres. After my grandfather died, it was managed by my father, who sold another 100 acres of ancestral property. Now my father passed away last year, so I inherited and managed the ancestral hall and ancestral property (according to my family's custom, the ancestral hall and ancestral property are managed by the eldest son of the eldest branch, and have always been regarded as private property. When my father sold the ancestral property, no clansmen came out to speak). Now the existing ancestral property is only 100 acres! (About 120-130 yuan can be produced each year, which I collect and use) Now please ask...</p>
<p>A, If clansmen come out and order me to replenish the ancestral property to 400 acres, am I legally responsible?</p>
<p>B, My ancestral hall is in the countryside of Suzhou. Because there are too many petty thieves in Jiangbei, no one dares to guard it. During the "January 28th Incident" last year, when the soldiers passed by, they dismantled the wood to fill defense projects and fuel. Now the ancestral hall has collapsed and there is no strength to rebuild it. If clansmen come out and force me to rebuild it, what legal responsibility should I bear?</p>
<p>(2) My relatives' family was originally well-off, but due to having a prodigal son, they gradually became indebted. This spring, the business failed again, so they could not support themselves. Now they owe about 3,000 yuan. Now they have houses, goods, furniture, and means of livelihood worth about 1,500 yuan. If they declare bankruptcy, they can probably repay about 50%. Are there any other criminal liabilities (such as imprisonment, etc.) besides declaring bankruptcy? Now my relative has left. Unexpectedly, this young master also slipped away. What kind of responsibility should this matter bear in law?</p>
<p>That's all. I hope you will answer me directly! Thank you, thank you! Best wishes</p>
<p>Respectfully, Wang Tonghe</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Regarding the first question, it should be attributed to the bad habits. According to the investigation of the ancestral hall and ancestral property, whether it was donated by the eldest branch alone or built by the entire clan, as the name suggests, it should be owned by the entire clan; how can it be regarded as the private property of the eldest branch? Your grandfather or father has already abused their power; the elders and juniors of the entire clan have also given up asking about it. For the current plan, it seems that Mr. Wang should come forward, invite the clansmen, declare on the one hand that the ancestral property should be returned to the clansmen, and declare on the other hand that he will give up this annual income of 120-130 yuan. Regarding the matters handled by your grandfather or father, since the clansmen have already given up in advance, now they can only request ratification; regarding the matters handled by Mr. Wang, they should be reported in detail. Whether to rebuild or not is up to the public opinion of the entire clan.</p>
<p>Regarding the second question, your relative suffered a loss of about 3,000 gold due to having a prodigal son and business failure. After mortgaging the houses, goods, furniture, and means of livelihood, they lost about 1,500 gold. This matter can be applied to the court and handled in accordance with the bankruptcy law; if there is no concealment, they can originally not bear other criminal liabilities. However, the father and son are now both leaving, which inevitably makes people suspicious. But if the matter is factual and there is no concealment, it is still best to come forward; if there is concealment, they should announce it automatically. Otherwise, the creditors can sue the court for absconding with the money. The houses, goods, furniture, and means of livelihood will inevitably be seized; and your relatives, father and son, must be arrested and brought to justice. At that time, even if you say there is no concealment, I am afraid no one will believe it.</p>

<h3>From the Song "Spring River Flower Moon Night" to Emerging Music (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ren Xida</p>
<p>But now in 1933, capitalism has entered its final period of contradiction. The development of machinery has instead become a demon in the fate of capitalism. The bourgeoisie is so unable to be optimistic. Therefore, all the music that exaggerates machinery and anesthetizes humanity is no longer enough to anesthetize people, and no longer enough to represent social life and resentment. Therefore, the "jazz" music of capitalism has also entered its final period of decline with the fate of capitalism, and can no longer develop.</p>
<p>During this transition period, "emerging" music has not yet become widespread, and old music has lost its timeliness. At the same time, the declining European bourgeoisie no longer has the power to develop its new class art. Therefore, the petty bourgeoisie who are looking for a way out in capitalism have found the aristocratic music before capitalism. They feel that this quiet mood can still give people a little memory of happiness. Therefore, they have adopted the songs in "Spring River Flower Moon Night" and the songs in "Yaohua Village" as a kind of attempt to modernize the music of the agricultural era. So it is very obvious that this kind of music is absolutely not suitable for the needs of the modern era, so its lifespan will not be long, and it will die before the decline of capitalism.</p>
<p>Now movies and music are almost inseparable, and must be harmonious. Since music has changed, the same is true of motion pictures. It has shifted from films about the madness of big capitalism to silence and satire. Therefore, the knight of capitalism, "Hollywood," has also moved from the United States to Europe. But if Europe brings "Hollywood" in its entirety and continues to be the knight of capitalism fighting for territory, it will be the same as "Hollywood" in the United States, which will not work! Therefore, we know that if we want to establish a second "Hollywood" in Europe, its movies must not only not be the knight of capitalism, but also the eulogist of capitalism. What will replace all the old music in the future is the new realist, popular music. This kind of music is brand new and progressive in both form and nature. Especially in the future, as society becomes more progressive and more organized, industrialized society, the "jazz" music representing the power of machinery will not only not eliminate this feature in the form of future "emerging" music, but will also more powerfully "organize" and "popularize" it. At the same time, in terms of emotion, it must completely eliminate its "anesthetic" and replace it with the deep cry and power of the largest number of people. Establish the new emerging music art, great value and success! Replace all the individual and anesthetic music of the old era and stand alone! (The End)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Heroes of Moscow"</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>(Clear All Wires)</p>
<p>Three Russian films have been shown in Shanghai, and the themes are completely to denigrate the decline of the world economy, the collapse of assets, and social unrest, to set off the bright road of socialism. Of course, the capitalist countries are not willing to give in and want to retaliate, so "Heroes of Moscow" Clear All Wires was produced in response to the times.</p>
<p>This is a humorous comedy, satirizing the boredom of the Soviet Russian government and the foolishness of the people, and creating a kind of contemptuous and insulting joke from these materials. Since it is a film that considers itself humorous, we don't seem to need to delve into the irrationality of the performance.</p>
<p>There is meaning to the play, but it is only for the attack on socialism, promoting the "heroic spirit" of the Americans.</p>
<p>In this point, I feel that the original motivation is somewhat like "Unbreakable" Welcome Danger three years ago.</p>
<p>The story is not very special, just to say that an American reporter stationed in Moscow was fired because of the lover of the newspaper manager. So he instigated someone to kill a White Russian aristocrat, in order to use this news to plot reinstatement. Unexpectedly, the assistant misunderstood and went to kill a Red Russian police chief. He was afraid of getting into trouble, so he protected the police chief at the expense of himself. The police chief was fortunate to be unharmed, and he himself was wounded by a gun. So he was called the "Hero of Moscow" by the Red Russians, and this news raised his value. Soon, he was reinstated and married his lover to become a reporter stationed in China.</p>
<p>Indeed, after the success of the first five-year plan in Soviet Russia, the housing problem has not yet been solved. (See the Soviet Inspection Record) This film tightly grasped this weakness to play out, but the depiction in it was excessive, and the stupidity, incompetence, and immorality of Soviet Russian material life and Soviet Russian people, from government members to small workers, were all unbelievable. Its purpose is to make people disgusted with socialism, but the result only exposes the despicable personality of American newspaper reporters.</p>
<p>In terms of technique, the director could not find anything except some inexplicable jokes that wanted to delve into Soviet Russia. A few of the shots can be considered clever, and the light is not important in a comedy, and it is average here. There are more dialogues than ordinary British films, and the pronunciation is good. Most of the humorous words in the dialogue are "witty remarks" that scold Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Lee Tracy, who plays the reporter, portrays the American newspaper reporter as having no backbone, really like a "dead end," and the performance is still worthy of being a "humorous star." The two female characters, BenitaHume and Una Merkel, are very ordinary, and there is nothing to recommend except for some glamorous sensuality.</p>
<p>The scenery is deliberately simple, writing Moscow like a ghost town. Perhaps Americans are particularly satisfied with this?</p>
<p>In short, it is an unusual comedy that vents its anger for capitalism and attacks Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Review of "Spring Water Love Waves"</h3>
<p>— Fang Long</p>
<p>From the opening of the film, we know that "Spring Water</p>
<h3>Lilian Harvey, who is skilled in English, German, and French, has now become the darling of both Europe and the United States, but Hollywood is trying to keep her in the United States. This is her recent photo.</h3>
<p>Love Waves" is based on the novel "Hidden Criminal," but the plot in the film is not very similar to "Hidden Criminal," and many of them have lost the original meaning of the book. This may be because the authors and screenwriters have different focuses.</p>
<p>The consciousness of this film is still acceptable, even if it cannot win everyone's satisfaction, at least it has pointed out the hypocrisy of snobbish marriages, the danger of reckless love, and the lessons that women who are played with should learn. Other aspects, such as the obsession with money, the obsession with officials, the local tyrants and evil gentry, the remnants of feudal forces, and the need for national unity at the end of the play, have all been given considerable play.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy point of the whole play is the shouting of the slogan of Northwest reclamation. The honeyed realm of the southeast and the desolation and abandonment of the border areas have formed the entire deformed weakness of China. It has a direct impact on problems such as economic collapse and rural bankruptcy. "Spring Water Love Waves" is the first to advocate saving three years of moxibustion, is this not worthy of praise?</p>
<p>The director is very hardworking, although he cannot find any outstanding features, the development of the whole play's plot and the rhythm of the performance can not lose the harmony of coordination, and the tense mood. In particular, the content and form are developed in a balanced and appropriate manner, and the audience's emotions are always grasped. The director's outstanding style is revealed everywhere in the grief of the victims in the play, the enlightenment of the environment of each person's awareness, the motivation of the transformation, the path of struggle, and the connection of each segment. In terms of skill, we also see considerable ingenuity, at least the director's skill is meticulous.</p>
<p>Speaking of the actors' performances, Hu Die has good facial expressions, and several close-ups are even more exciting. Sun Min's performance is still sincere in two scenes. Although Hu Ping's performance opportunities are few, the results are very good. Yan Yuexian is also good.</p>
<p>The scenery is very beautiful, and the scenery is generally good. However, the water surface of Chunshui Lake is too narrow, it is simply like a small stream, which is a fly in the ointment. The position of the lens, the photography light, etc. are all good, and the subtitles have also given considerable help.</p>
<p>In short, "Spring Water Love Waves" is a progressive film, which always gives the audience a good impression, although it lacks some stimulation.</p>
<h3>An Overview of Soviet Russian Films (3)</h3>
<p>— Written by Rudolf Messumin</p>
<p>(2) The Plan of the Soviet Russian Film Industry</p>
<p>Within the entire territory of the Soviet Union, the film industry is the most important tool for communication. Since other industries have careful and detailed plans, the film industry cannot be an exception. In the interest of facilitating film propaganda throughout the country, Soviet Russia divides the country into regions; in a broad sense, these regions are like the four poles of a compass. Within each region, there is an organization of a central production place, which is a large photography place. This large photography place has the authority to control and manage the small photography places established in various important locations in the region. And the large photography place is subordinate to the All-Union Cinema Sojus or Kint in Moscow. The All-Union Cinema Union controls the power of the national film industry; it is responsible for the economic maintenance of production places in various regions; the products of photography places in various regions are also accepted and controlled by it; and it supervises and guides the progress of affairs in various regions at any time. But in fact, the subordinate organizations in various regions enjoy a lot of freedom and are not subject to undue interference from the parent organization, and the orders issued by the parent organization are only limited to the length of films required by photography places in various regions, and there is very little interference in the content and themes of the films.</p>
<p>The Soviet authorities must establish a central production place in each region so that the central organization can distribute films depicting the life conditions of a certain region to other regions of the country. The life culture of the Gothozo region is very different from the life culture of the German, Volga, or Siberian regions, but the Soviet authorities firmly believe that if films depicting the life conditions of various regions can be exchanged and transported with each other, they can not only benefit the people's impressions, but also generate the idea of unity among the people and arouse the responsibility of cooperation.</p>
<p>They also said that allowing the residents of Turkey to see pictures of the actions of Caucasians whose lives are completely different from theirs is enough to make them feel that although the lives of races are different, they are working for socialism... In this way, the emotions of ignorance and isolation from the world that are often self-conscious by backward nations can be eliminated. In this way, the people of Turkey can realize from the film that they are not isolated, but are part of a larger plan, and are working hard for the construction of socialism, regardless of race and boundaries. As for the various fears held by these nations, such as the oppression and prohibition of special customs, etc., they can also be calmed down by the simple method of film propaganda.</p>

<h3>Construction of Shanghai North Railway Station Commences</h3>
<p>Architect Zhao Shen Assists in Design</p>
<p>丨 Zhongnan Construction Company Undertakes Construction 丨</p>
<h3>The Refreshed New Look of Shanghai North Railway Station After Reconstruction (Drawings by the Design Department of Hua Yi Architectural Firm)</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways previously planned to build a new station, but this was temporarily suspended due to the current situation. The original site of the North Station is now filled with dilapidated walls and ruins, which not only obstruct the view but also lack a place for passengers to rest while waiting for trains. The railway's traffic department also needs to have a station office to manage train operations. Since the new station will not be built for the time being, the renovation of the old station cannot be delayed. After the bureau submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways and obtained approval, it immediately published a public tender for construction. The bureau opened the bids publicly on the afternoon of May 1st, receiving a total of seventeen bids. As a result, Zhongnan Construction Company was deemed the most suitable and was awarded the project. It is reported that the bureau's goal in renovating the old station is to utilize the existing foundations and stone walls to create a more modern station. The entire building will have three floors, with the first and second floors serving as offices for the traffic department, and the lower floor also serving as a waiting area for passengers. Upon entering, there will be a large hall, with waiting rooms, baggage storage, a dining room, a cloakroom, a washroom, etc. on the left and right sides of the hall, all simple, beautiful, and practical. The entire project is managed by the bureau's engineering department, with architect Zhao Shen of Hua Yi Architectural Firm responsible for the internal and external layout, decoration, and construction matters. It is estimated that the project will be completed in a few months, at which time the North Station will have a completely new look.</p>
<h3>On International-Style Architecture by Huang Yingdai</h3>
<p>In the past ten years, many new meanings have emerged, but now they have reached a point of exhaustion. When we go to major European cities, especially in the United States, all the buildings have already been ruined by modern architecture. The so-called modernists do not refer specifically to architectural techniques. This plan uses various different new styles. They have developed a strong interest in the uniqueness of the exterior, rather than using new materials to build houses to suit issues such as tools, speed, and economy. These modernist architects can consider all aspects of the slanted or straight lines of windows and doors, black, white, and various other colored bricks, tiles, and cement, all forms and colors, shiny metals, special wood, and various decorations. And extremely pay attention to so-called modernist architects. When planning buildings, they pay great attention to the external inclined columns, but treat the internal columns that support the roof as unimportant. There are special decorations on the top of those columns, some with floral stones, some with concrete decorations, and in the middle of the windows, special iron plates or stones are also used to make everything different from the past. They assume that all the facades of the houses must be concrete or made of floral stone glass, and all the corners of the houses must be made of glass. The entrance walkways are especially unique, with imitation brick and stone forming unusual walls. Everything has a peculiar color. Modernists believe that all modern objects have unsafe characteristics in the planning of the interior construction of houses. I remember an interesting joke that happened in the market once. A modernist architect was walking by hunched over. A friend asked, "What's wrong with you? Does your back hurt?" He replied, "No, it's not a backache, it's modern objects."</p>
<p>So-called modern architecture, which is currently the most popular, is about building houses of different styles. Currently, it does not seek for the house itself to exist permanently, but only for the house to have a certain characteristic, and the main condition is to satisfy everything. So, what conditions must this kind of house meet? Simply put, it must meet everything modern, everything can be harmonized and unified, neat and simple, with special colors, each room will not conflict with each other, and all material and spiritual needs are met. We are no longer interested in imitating all the methods in architecture for four thousand years. It has nothing to do with us. The value it possesses no longer exists. And because of the architectural revolution, people's old ideas have been completely eliminated. Many 20th-century art architects say that in architecture, as a result of the development of industry, so-called art has already died out. And in the current era, the buildings produced in the evolution of so-called art have completely eliminated the beauty of buildings. In terms of facts, we can all see new buildings built with new materials such as steel, cement, and glass. But they don't pay much attention to art. As for ancient architecture, it is not like this. Their architecture emphasizes the spirit, and the interior decoration is especially considered an important matter. But the important qualities that modern architecture considers are completely different from the past. We are at the beginning of an era because we have the ultimate ability in technology, and now we know that architecture is in revolution and produces all kinds of forms that did not exist before. However, when new materials are adopted, human life above the standard, and human beings and industry and commerce are progressing so rapidly, what important changes will occur in architecture? When constructing houses, we use all new materials as materials. However, we still wear masks and use thousands of years of indoor decoration methods to cover up the new buildings. And there is another fallacy, pretending these houses to be a kind of modern architecture. Can these modern building materials really help us build those bank houses, train stations, and various offices, engine rooms, various private residences, and increase the beauty of the appearance? And are we all using these functions? Do we have a faithful attitude towards these buildings? However, we have a disgust for all houses that are too expensive and useless, and we have a completely faithful attitude to deal with all buildings. "</p>
<p>"I once found a rubber factory built in 1931 in a very famous industrial center city. The outside was built in the Egyptian style with cement, and the outside was carved with sphinxes, lotus flowers, lotus leaves, everything. Opposite half a mile away, a factory building was built with cement and steel bones. This house made people feel disgusted. Train stations, bank offices, apartments, warehouses, these houses have different styles. Some imitate ancient Greek temples, some imitate the palaces of the Nanhua, and even the churches after the revival. When we see these complicated and chaotic houses, we almost feel dizzy. Large stones or marble pillars are useless and added with ugly decorations. Paired with modern buildings, it will inevitably make people disgusted and feel the hypocrisy of architecture. So who can use new raw materials to build era buildings? Of course, our general bold engineers will take on this important mission. They have built large ocean-going ships, various offices, bank offices, and engineers have also built bridges, mine rooms, railways, oil stations, power generation rooms, power rooms, airplanes, airships, and all other modern machines. The tall multi-story buildings of the factory. The first floor is made of glass. The steel bone columns are also very thin. And 60 floors of houses can be built on top. These engineers use arithmetic methods to generate these buildings, which limit the laws of nature. And build this era architecture, which makes us feel that everything is in tune and harmonious. We are not discarding all the architectural styles of the ancient times. They are not single-mindedly imitating the houses of the Italian Renaissance. In summary, these new buildings are taking the advantages of ancient architecture and abandoning its disadvantages, and then using various new methods to apply them to the buildings of the era."</p>
<p>"We only need to see the grain silos and heavy-duty cranes in the United States, Canada, and Buenos Aires, etc., which are the first fruits produced in this new century. Engineers are not enthusiastically pursuing a correct theory of architecture. They are just holding a kind of cold and calm attitude. And led by a principle that controls the universe, we get a method of estimation. We only need to see the aesthetics of all modern engineering. From the automatic trains from New York to Chicago, the sleeper cars in France, the Zeppelin airships in Germany, the giant ocean-going ships in the United Kingdom, the airplanes in Italy, the tanks in Switzerland, mechanical and electrical power have made today's world form a special scene. And have the practical ability and courage to make this scene a reality. They use modern materials to build modern styles, and all the outdated, ineffective, and meaningless clichés in the old style are completely discarded. The era when the life of architecture moved on a narrow road has now reached its end. And it has reached a period of a new spirit being generated. All engineers can use clear ideas to engage in architecture, so that the buildings of the era will be produced endlessly with the era."</p>
<h3>On Modern Architecture and Interior Decoration by Ying</h3>
<p>In Europe and America, in the past few years, many buildings have tended towards the architectural movement of the times, based on the inherent architectural style of the country, and also imitating all architectural styles, taking the best and making up for the worst, in order to make the architecture increasingly perfect. The only reason for the emergence of this kind of building is that it is influenced by modern life. In a designated area, when we are building, everything should be in line with science, so that a house, we live inside, is like a machine, the general architect. Are carefully considering abandoning all the unnecessary decorations on the outside of the house, and the interior decorations are also the same, and striving to emphasize the economic and functional aspects. To put it plainly, it is to make the building have a great function and be suitable for economic principles. Most women are engaged in active occupations or social life. They all hope to use the least amount of effort to get the most pleasure. Just touch a mysterious key, and the things they need, hot water or cold water, hot air or cold air, either in one room or in the whole house, can be as they wish. Use electricity to light or cook. In the electric cold room, you can keep all the meals at a certain temperature. Just turn her wrist, and she can prepare a meal for the king. On the flameless electric stove, she can cook all kinds of meals, and she can take the canned food from the shelf at any time and open it to listen. The sound of electric vacuum cleaners and sewing machines, in the ears of housewives, is like the music from the radio, or the sound of piano playing, exactly the same. In a modern house, all the equipment can reduce working hours, like a typewriter, very fast, and very useful. The external form uses a logical way to determine everything, and the interior also matches the exterior in this way. If we study the problem of function in detail, then perhaps it is not in a house, the turning point of construction, and the starting point are related. The architectural raw materials used all have a natural and faithful expression, and there is no inappropriate situation for all the objects in the house, and there is no close relationship with the architectural elements.</p>
<p>Inside the house, the ground must be free, and the rooms must have empty spaces. The size of the area must have a considerable function. The transportation of utensils and the movement of people should save time. In the house, the empty spaces left in the bedroom and the places where housework is done should be appropriate, especially the places where sunlight shines. New construction raw materials · steel · hard · glass, and other various metals, make it possible to build a wide and bright house, and at the same time save a lot of raw materials. Compared with the previous buildings, they are very different from each other, and the previous ones are not suitable for use. In the buildings built in the past, all the walls were made wide, and the gaps in the doors and windows were made small. But what about modern architecture? This method is completely abandoned. The weight of the house is entirely placed on the pure steel bones or other bones. The ceiling and floor have no positive aspects. The floor aspect is completely supported by itself, and at the same time has the power to resist the environment, heat, cold, and the sound of the eardrum. Now we all advocate that extremely strong light should be injected from the outside, so scientists have a kind of glass, and the invention of this glass allows light to completely penetrate it, so the window has become the main element in a room. All the walls are now almost completely replaced by glass windows. If a house is built in a modern city, then we must use various methods to grasp the light. Many gaps are left for windows, so that the people who live inside can have more contact with outdoor life, and considering the current situation, this is also the general trend, which is due to the needs of modern civilization.</p>
<p>What is the function of modern architecture? In terms of ideal purpose, planning, and construction, it is completely consistent. All the houses are isolated properly, so that the beauty reaches a high limit, and at the same time makes the construction of the houses appropriate in weight and harmonious in structure. When general architects are building houses and planning them, they pay great attention to the issue of beauty.</p>
