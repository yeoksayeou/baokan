<p>時評</p>
<p>復興農村會議以後實</p>
<p>復興農村會議窮兩日之力。分組審議各項原則并擬在行政院指導之下。就各省設立分。會期其實行。吾人就技術組。經濟組。組織組。所擬定之綱。要略加檢討。在農村技術方面。於水利。土壤肥料。農具。種子。家畜。病害蟲。以至農村副業等。皆曾有相當研究。在農村經濟方面。對農民銀行。合作社。以至　當等調劑金融機關。與夫農産品之流通問題。亦具討論綱領。關於組織方面。對農村自治。農村敎育。保衛。衛生。以及娱樂等。又皆標出大綱。意在努力以促其實現。</p>
<p>綜觀上述綱要。已可窺見復興農村之内容。我國國勢。衰頽已極。對復興農村。在理論上事實上。皆無絲毫懷疑之餘地。顧凡欲確立方案。須視其是否能針對當前之需要。而爲農民大衆所樂於奉行。反之徒有方案而不能見諸實行。實行而不得力。甚或根本與農村隔膜。至爲農人所反對。則匪特於事實無補。且徒致紛擾。頃者復興農村會所擬之各種綱要。誠亦能顧及目前之需要。但欲舒農村困苦。吾人竊以爲未足也。</p>
<p>第一。在消極方面。農村在經濟上已萬分枯渴。以江浙富庶之區。因絲。茶。漁。各項副業齊趨凋落之故。致鄕村間欲覓一圓現金以購蠶種而不可得。則是銀行放欵。信用合作社組織之推行。洵爲當務之急矣。然而「銀行」之農村分行。支店。尙不知何時始克設立。則農民爲窘困之勢所迫。高利貸之盤剥。仍舊不能免除。故吾謂今後欲希望農村復興。對經濟上高利貸剥削之問題。不可忽視。此其一。再則農民離村。在今日之中國。固有種種複雜關聯。由資本主義之侵略。至於國内政治不安。皆爲其主要因素。而穀價猛跌。又値靑黄不接之際。農村愈覺疲廠不堪。　在今日謀農民生活之如何維持。以及穀價之如何安定。均爲當前焦眉之急。此其二。</p>
<p>政治上原因。若僅就表面觀察。似尙不致影響農村。然而我國今日之經濟社會。仍不脫農業形態。至爲顯然故一切捐稅。類皆轉嫁於農民。貪官污吏之剥削。又多以農民爲對象。故今日而言復興農村。如不先肅淸貪官污吏。任其繼續敲剥。則農村恐永無復興之日。再則苛捐雜稅。於産業之發達。固多阻碍。而於農村之頽败。尤屬要因。此種阻碍而不加剔除。則一切無從着手。此亦爲復興農村運動聲中所應深刻注意者也。</p>
<p>第二。在積極方面。農業生産之低落。由洋米。洋麥。以及外國麵粉之大量輸入。即可得一明證。雖米價低落至於生産費用以下。然而自耕農民。竟有饑色。甚至流爲餓莩。由是更促進農村生産之衰退。愈引起一般社會之不安。復興農村會議。對農業生産技術。雖略有提示。而於安定農民生活。似尙未加以充分注意。此其缺少積極之方案一也。</p>
<p>更有進者。農村問題之核心。農業經營之基礎。「土地」關係。如不能求得適當解决方法。則其他農村一切問題。皆無從說起。蓋膏强者可以操縱其間。肆行兼併。而眞正出力耕作。勤苦耐勞之純粹農民。依然受人牽割。農田荒廢日多。農民不平愈甚。於此而欲圖農村之復興。其何能得。是以「土地問題。」在農村問題解决中。實爲先决之要件。復興農村。而不提示土地問題之解决方法。是即缺少積極之方案二也。</p>
<p>至於農村自治之基礎。究竟何在。屬於政治方面。且爲上層組織。農民當此求生不暇之際。未必即能熱烈追求。是以安定農民生活及土地問題之適當解决。乃爲復興農村之初步要圖。</p>

<p>日本現内閣與軍部（日本通信）</p>
<p>日本財政廳長高橋是淸辭職的問題、鬧了這樣久、還是没有結論、究竟是高橋辭職之後、齋藤内閣一部分改造呢、還是聯帶着總辭職呢、這正是日本政治上一個難問題、也是一個有趣味的問題、</p>
<p>先就政黨方面、略加分析如下、民政黨自已實力不夠、同時也知道一般人對政黨政治表示厭倦、而民政黨在議會中、又只有一百二十二個議席、即使現内閣倒台、牠决没有組閣的希望、所以不如作政府與黨、附合非常時的說法、旣可以拉攏實力派、有機會即歡迎宇垣一成入爲該黨總裁、又可以乘此時機、多培養自己的實力、政友會則有將近二百九十八頭議員、照常理講、牠確實該掌握政權、所以高倡「非常時消解論」、反映出炭復立憲政治常軌的說法、力主高橋一旦辭職、齋藤内閣就應該瓦解、但何以到現在、并不曾發動倒閣運動呢、其原因、第一、是政友會内部意見不一致、久原派床次派的對立不能消除、鈴木幾乎不能統率、假使正式倒閣、則政友會本身、就不免分裂、第二、是對軍部和元老方面、都不能求得充分的諒解、何况所謂政黨政治、自從九一八事變之後、即已壽終正寢、至於國民同盟、雖號爲法西斯的代表團體、與軍部和平沼等都有相當密切關係、可是議院實力很小、事實上不過是軍部的尾巴、自己决没有實力、所以只得吵吵、并不發生上層的政治影響和下層的羣衆影響、</p>
<p>在日本支配上層的勢力是軍部、而一般羣衆中有軍事力量作背景、有「在鄕軍人會」和其他右傾團體的活動、於是在民衆間、也只看見軍國主義的力量、因此齋藤内閣組織之初、就說是爲了消除非常時代的國内不安、爲了遂行其大陸侵略政策、換言之、是軍部作後台的「强力内閣、」所謂政民兩黨的混合（協同）内閣、不過是一塊政治上的招牌、所以政友會要倒閣、非看軍部的顔色不可、軍部對於政局的見解、丨丨各領袖的意見、綜合起來、略述如下、</p>
<p>（一）軍部雖不至於惡意的否定政黨政治、但是軍部一切的行動、是要超越乎一般的政治動向、而且要排斥從前政黨政治的弊病、同時更要喚起一般人民排擊這種毛病、</p>
<p>（二）要隱「滿洲」（僞）國的基礎、盡力之所能取得外交上的承認、</p>
<p>（三）退出國聯之後、日本外交似陷於孤立、現在須重新建立外交基歴、變更以前的外交政策、當然首要的是聯絡英國、否則在某種條件之下、聯美也可以、總之是以完成「滿蒙」的獲得爲主眼、（四）克服（日本）國内經濟的恐慌、是防止思想惡化的要着、所以救濟農村是當前之急、這都不是一黨一派所能勝任的、</p>
<p>（五）「滿洲」的占領、雖有一年多、可是還說不到眞正就緒、即建設工作的確立、至少還得二三年、在這個二三年當中、到底還是很重大的時期、特别是樹立」日滿經濟統制」的根基、更是一件艱苦的事、現在軍事在東三省境内、僅告一段、可是政治還没有開始、今後要作的事、非常的重大、决非一黨一派所能完成、</p>
<p>上述五點、是軍部方面最近露出來的意思、縱然不是用正式的任何方式發表出來、但是表白了軍部的立場、很顯明的提出不贊成政黨政治、和進一步侵略中國的意見、對齋藤内閣不必一力支援、而主張强力内閣、却是事實、齋藤固弱、但是聽軍部侵略政策自由發展、亦不失爲良好工具、如果齋藤倒台、則繼任内閣、無論如何、必然要比齋藤還更聽軍部指揮、纔能撑持、（一九三三·四·卅日於東京）</p>

<p>蘇俄出售中東路說</p>
<p>伍朝樞發表重要談話</p>
<p>中俄復交伊始此事殊堪惋惜</p>
<p>莫斯科電傳、蘇俄爲求解决中東路之糾紛、提議將該路出售事、頗與我國有關、新聲社記者、因於昨日、經訪中委伍朝樞博士、探詢其意見、伍氏以爲中俄兩國、正在復交、互換大使、爲時不久、俄方忽有此舉、對之深表惋惜、並謂此項提議、顯然違背原訂鐡路合同、且亦非蘇俄將來之福、茲分誌其所述各節於後、</p>
<p>有背合同</p>
<p>伍氏答記者之問云、蘇俄提議中東路出售事、已在報端見之、但此事絶非蘇俄　應作之事、蓋以其有背原訂鐡路合同規定、該路屬於中俄兩國、不能轉讓於第三者也、繼謂、如俄方出售中東路、在俄國自身之眼光觀察、設承認東三省仍爲中國之一部份領土、則出售應與我國政府磋商、不應與地方當局磋商、設認東北已脫離中國、向僞國出售、則爲違背合同、蓋僞國即爲第三者矣、何况事實上僞國即係日本、故此舉動之不合法、不待言也、</p>
<p>深爲惋惜</p>
<p>繼謂以渠個人主意、中央對此事、應表示意見、作一鄭重之聲明、目蘇俄此舉、適在兩國新近復交、我國駐俄大使與蘇俄駐華大使到任、呈遞國書之初、殊可惋惜也、在俄方大抵爲免除目前困難、不得已而擬出此、但即令出售或成事實、亦不過僅求得目前之解决耳、日後之糾紛、必更增重、終非蘇俄前途之福、所幸此事尙在醖釀之中、惟有希望俄方熟思審愼出之爲佳也、</p>
<p>經濟會議</p>
<p>關於在英舉行之世界經濟會、據伍氏觀察、日本黷武與侵略東北、雖於解决世界經濟問題有關、但深以爲該會一定避免討論之、吾人期欲以國際會議解决東北問題、實不可得、余曾屢次言之、希望他人救我者、實不如自救、他人之所能協助於我者、亦只能說說幾句公道話耳、東北之淪陷、不能靠幾句公道話、便可收復也、所可恃者、仍爲自己之力量耳、</p>
<p>否認僞國</p>
<p>近日國聯小組委員會所擬成之不承認僞國說帖、伍氏對之、亦略有評語、謂國聯只能作到僞國之「不承認」一節、不能作到四省之恢復、欲想達到恢復之目的、仍須吾人自爲之、</p>
<p>墨國排華</p>
<p>於墨西哥之排華運動、此事　不近乎情理、然事之發生已非一日、數年前即有排華之舉、此事在於國勢之强弱、國家軟弱、即爲人欺侮、故弱國國民、處處均蒙不利也、</p>
<p>研究史地</p>
<p>此外伍氏并表示、渠於一兩星期之前、曾作浙江上游一帶旅行、史金華衢縣常山入江西之玉山、伍氏在玉山所立足之地、前一晚即有共匪來擾防軍與之交戰、一小時之久、始將其擊退、伍氏以爲中國領域廣大、風俗人情等、隨地而異、凡事非親歷其境者、實無以得其實在、故「閉門造車」不能千里合轍也、渠平時頗喜研究地理歷史、而作各地之旅行、尤有興趣、自謂此行獲益不少云、</p>
<p>恊定摘要</p>
<p>（記者按）中俄協定第九條之規定、爲「蘇俄政府允諾以中國資本贖回中東路、及該路所屬一切財産、并允諾將該路股票移歸中國、」第五欵規定、兩締約國、承認對中東路之前途、祇能由中俄兩國取决、不許第三者干涉、又奉俄協定第一條第四欵、亦有相類似之規定、「締約國雙方彼此同意、東省鐡路之前途、祗應由中國及蘇聯兩國取决、不許第三者干涉」</p>

<p>恢復勇氣與團體生活</p>
<p>南潯曹海帆君來信</p>
<p>我是奮鬥的敗將，時代的落伍者，靑責年紀，已經失却了勇氣，脆弱的心上，滿佈了無數的創痕，我深切地感覺到自己的意識，在一天一天的向那覆落的深淵襄陷落，没落的悲哀，恐怕己迫近在我的眉睫了！鄙人是站在舊時代的商店裏的一名小職員，每天在過着依賴式的生活，五六年來，這小小的魔窟，丨商店丨是葬送了我整個的黎明時期。於是我的自由，便被剥奪了，我的前進的志向，便被毁滅了，甚至毁滅了我畢生的幸福，這裏，我深切地體味到一個靑年在發軔之始的時候，是不容忽視的，但我並不在寃我的父母，因爲我的父母只是局於客觀的眼光，而史見到商人表面的虚僞，並不知道商人的内容是空虚的。我因爲不能忍受這種生活，而想到奮鬥，「只有奮鬥才是自己的出路，」心裏常這麽想：但這頑固的社會是容許你有奮鬥的機會嗎？苦鬥了好些時，非但得不到良好的結果。而且受了重創，結果與從前一些没有兩樣，但這亦不能怨人，這完全是自己缺乏專門的技藝所致。寫到這裏，我不得不欽佩那街頭呌賣的五香荳的小販了。他們的生活不是完全獨立嗎？記得從前讀過郁達夫的過去集　。有這麽一稿的文字，一我從小若學作木匠，今日至少也有一二所房子造成了，我從小若學做裁縫，不消說現在我也能裁成綺麗的衣服了，……」這一段事實，十足的代表了我今日的心情，到現在弄得無一藝之長，横又不能豎又不能，覺得自己完全是無用之物，在靜夜裏，追溯着這些事，一種自殺的意識，便常爲　入我的腦海裏，但一回憶到，一自殺是一種卑怯的行爲，是根本没有迫視人生黑暗的勇氣，……」一轉念間，又把這意識打消了，仍然在這灰色的雰圍中掙扎着，在苟延着殘喘，以冀得到最後的一點希望。先生！你不」以爲我是在無病呻吟，在效着舊婦人的悲啼，現在我請敎二項問題請你於報上答復我，（一）一個靑年到了這種境地，能不能設法去挽求他已失的勇氣，（二）怎樣來做一個自新的人，</p>
<p>答：來書所詢兩事，敬答如左，（一）「一個靑年到了這種境地」一定能以「設法去挽救他已失的勇氣」的，但須有一個條件，就是要把己身的利害與社會大多數人的利害聯繫起來，把自己的前途與社會大多數人的前途聯繫起來，並且把現在社會大多數人的利害與前途和前有千年後有百世的最大多數甚至全人類的利害與幸福聯擊起來　　同順昌之純　剪刀法租　吉祥　老同順昌毡毯店王彦璋君、經售江蘇洞庭山　　剪刀以來、　受用者赞譽、良以刀鋒快利、稱心應　、茲爲提倡國貨起見、批　零售、一律廉價云、</p>

<p>，自然可以鼓起你的勇氣，繼續不斷地增加你奮鬥的精神。世人因奮鬥失敗而灰心短氣者，大都因爲他只以已身之利害或一時之利害爲利害，而没有看到現在與將來社會大多數以及全人類的利害，並且没有把現在的失敗便是將來成功的必經的過程；個人的失敗便是將來他人及大多數人成功的必經的過程。用這種見解做個人奮鬥的指針，便永不會灰心短氣的，第一次失敗了帶着第一次的經騐再來第二次；第二次失敗了，帶了第一，第二兩次的經騐再來第三次，以至無數次，必有成功之一日：假使及身不能成功，必有繼我而起者收其效，食其賜，這末一來，你的勇氣必是越來越增，絶不會失掉的。（二）現在生活就是鬥爭的生活，並且不是個人鬥爭的生活，而是集團鬥爭的生活：不僅要參加公開的，合法的集團的鬥爭生活，把上面兩個問題切實地解决了，你便可做一個自新的人了。</p>

<h3>變</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>齊一變，至於魯，魯一變，至於道。」這是脫胎換形，變得着實不錯！</p>
<p>孫行者，猪八戒，牛魔王，黑風怪，摇身一變，變做美貌佳人；變做風流雅士，這種變外形雖變，内心不變，變得未見高明。</p>
<p>對神榜上說：「妲已招了許多孤子狐孫，變做衆仙模樣，在鹿台上喝酒。喝得太多了，一個個臀後拖着一條蓬鬆大尾。」這種變呌做狐狸精顯原形，變得最　脚。</p>
<p>台上的魔術家，穿那整齊的禮服；應用着光學，聲學，催眠術的原理，變起來神出鬼没，着實使人驚奇。</p>
<p>廣塲上圍着一大堆人，大鑼大皷敲着。山東佬赤着膊，口裏吐火：甕中殺小孩，也變得使人呌好。</p>
<p>只有猴子做的戲法，雖是披着紅衣：雖是戴着面具；雖是會做李三娘挑水；雖是會做王伯黨招親，可仍是一隻猴子，變不像人。</p>
<p>「戲」法人人會變，各有巧妙不同。」且看世界舞台上變的戲法吧！</p>
<p>列寗口中唸唸有詞；麽術棒一指，把極右的專制，變做極左的共産，這戲法是變得很高明的。</p>
<p>基瑪爾蹲身地下，把布袱一掩，等一回揭露出來，多病多愁的土耳其，頃刻返老爲童，也變得手法靈活。</p>
<p>現在的墨索里尼，希特勒，羅斯福……，也正在大變戲法。這戲法變得好不好，妙不妙，請諸位靜瞧着吧！</p>
<p>我們中國現在變甚麽戲法，我可賣一個關子，不肯告訴出來。或許是西洋麽術；或許中國戲法；或許是猴子演獻，三者必有其一。</p>
<p>「蓋棺論定。」人死了才能確定其是非，我們中國不亡，這戲法是好是歹，還不能肯定咧！</p>
<h3>東京將沉海底</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>東京日日新聞載，帝國大學地震研究所技師宫部直已氏，根日着東京市土木局道路建設課的調查、發表說，在這未來的二年中，東京及其附近的地段，將爱漸逐漸地下沉，逐漸逐斬地沉到東洋大海底裏去。目下全東京人士，莫不大起恐慌云。</p>
<p>日本人來殺人放火，扔炸彈，搶地皮，我們中國「因爲不能戰而抵抗」，這是多麽可以痛心的一回事。但是論「殺人放火」的勾當，中國夠不上日本，若是說「幸災樂禍」，咒咒駡駡，那我們中國人却强得多。從「國難」誕生時起，「葷口裏念經，素口裏駡人」的愛國朋友，莫不朝一炷香，晚一對燭的祈禱着伏羲文王，周公，孔子，天降鞠凶於日本，再來一次大地震，以便中國輕而易舉到不费吹灰之力去收復失地。若是宫部直已氏的科學預言，果然應騐，那眞是「阿彌陀佛，天有眼睛。」</p>
<p>在不久以前，有一位某公發表談話，說日本不出十年，必將大起革命。到那時，自會把吞下肚的東北，整塊嘔出來，還給中國。當時有很多人切切喳喳在背地裏議論，以爲没有那麽容易。但是照宫部直已氏的說法，看來，哈哈，何用十年，滄海桑田，怕不二年之後，天亡日本了麽？</p>
<p>記得十年前，有一位天文家說，某月某日，金星將碰地球的頭，地球將碎爲虀粉。當時較爲優秀的中國人，於是都挖了地窖子，以避大刦。這方法，我看恐慌的東京人士，倒大可仿行。若是日本人傻得連這方法都不會模仿，那麽，惟有縮短「三年亡滿計劃」，在二年内完成，以便把京城搬到奉天去。</p>
<h3>都市散記</h3>
<p>— 郭蘭馨</p>
<p>現在已經是流水落花春去也的初夏時節了。在煤烟灰籠罩的都市中，那黄浦江終年黄濁的江水激蕩外，看不見一條淸澈的流水，馬路上的女人們脂紅粉白，五色繽紛的袍裾飄掠，從皮大衣裏剥出了一個曲線肉感的腰體使人迷惑外，也看不見一朶落花，或者一瓣殘紅。許多勞工們在被壓迫的工作下面吟呻外，更聽不見泣血的鵑啼，至於羣鶯亂飛，祇有在東新橋北京路偷鷄橋一帶的雉妓被巡捕驅逐的時光，大自然的風景，都市中將使任何人失望丨雖是半亡國式的租界，也有幾個公園點綴，但市民把自己的錢，被外人去經營公園，踏進去自己有些慚愧，同時都是人工的裝點。</p>
<p>都市自從與繁華罪惡結識同居以後，將春遺棄了。春雖是嚴妝艶麗，但都市是不能再享受，祗好受燈紅酒綠的腻艶包圍。都市淸醒的時光懺悔，但什麽都遲了，春也不願投進都市的懷中，除了春風輕拂中報告消息外，其它什麽也不會再與都市作繁華罪惡没有结識同居前的親切了。年年的春，依舊給幸福的人們祝福，給傷心的人們慰安，同時也給傷心的人們悽愴哀愁！這樣咒咀都市薄倖中春漸漸忘了都市。</p>
<h3>春夜</h3>
<p>— 憶秋</p>
<p>咱們中國，向來是國泰民安；現在春深了，西子湖畔的旅館，家家客滿；黄捕江邊的舞塲和戲院處處擁擠，看阿！不正在酒綠燈紅地歌舞昇平嗎現在，咱們的國家，雖說有些舞關緊要的外侮，可是不打緊，國難會議已開過了，我們的政府，早有了「全盤計劃」並且已在「長期抵抗」了用不着我們老百姓來躭心。至於近來農村經濟的破産，對於國計民生，確有些危險性，可是也不打聚，「農村復興委員會」已成立了，更用不着我們庸人自擾！</p>
<p>在這「春色惱人眠不得」的當兒，我雖不會吟風弄月，也讓我來「閒情逸致」一下吧。</p>
<p>花兒總是背着人悄悄地開放，</p>
<p>而又在人們不知不覺中枯萎了！</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>春光是姗姗其來遲，</p>
<p>却又怱怱地歸去！</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>月兒看見過無數情侣的笑容，</p>
<p>又不知看見了多少孤獨者的涙痕。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>世界上最没有冷暖的是淸風，</p>
<p>因爲它常常接近着一般最窮苦的人。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>水，能夠洗去人身上的骯髒，</p>

<h3>竃下雜談</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>各别的爐灶</p>
<p>食的問題人生三要素之一，，烹調法便各處有各處的口味，就是解决「食的問題」的爐灶，也很不一致。</p>
<p>在江南各處大都是長烟囱磗砌的大竈，普通些有三眠灶，兩眼竈，有兩隻鍋的稱爲兩眼，三隻鍋的稱爲三眼。這類大灶因砌在廚房襄，燃料多半是用茅柴和稻柴之類，使用的時候，須一個人燒着火，一人纔可以從容去炒菜，否則又要燒火，又要炒菜，火工或大或小，炒菜或生或焦，一個人如何兼顧得了？堆積燃料，尤其累墜費事，一百斤二百斤一擔擔的柴，堆滿一屋子，算是堆柴間；試想在都市人烟稠密的所在，住的房屋還發生問題，那有空餘的地位，去作爲燃料的倉庫？所以這種舊式呆笨的大灶，已不適用。</p>
<p>在北方普通用的煤灶燃些熟煤或是煤球，祗是大都没有烟囱，煤氣藴積，盤旋在室内不散，頗容易便人吸收了煤毒，對於患肺病的人尤其是不相宜，雖然也有人說，著沸了水的蒸氣，可以解煤毒，究竟還是危險的事！所以要用煤灶必須先按上烟囱。但是煤灶究比燒茅柴的大灶來得簡便適用，至少第一樁日常用的開水，可以不必過慮！在我們江浙一帶有售水的「老虎灶」不過往往在老虎灶所泡的水並不是煮沸的水，竟有人吃了未沸的水而致病的。</p>
<p>「行灶」似乎很方便，可以隨處搬動，頗適用於一般遊牧生活的民衆，就是我們常常看到行軍打仗的兵士，「埋鍋造飯」那便是所謂行灶，所需的燃料以木柴爲主，居家並不相宜。</p>
<p>在普通人口稀少之有，燃煤灶嫌費事，所以現在很有許多人用「白泥爐」的，倒眞算得輕便易舉，最方便用的時候生兩隻白泥爐，一隻煮飯，一隻煮菜，爐堂小，燒煤球也省，生火也最快，這類白泥爐，從前是用作冬天圍爐取煖的，現在竟奪了廚房灶下的地位了。</p>
<p>便有許多人家因陋就簡，用「煤油小爐子」煮菜煮飯，雖然也可以將就從事，但是「急病遇着慢郎中」性子急的人决不相宜，因爲在煤油爐上煮菜煮飯所需的時間，比了煤爐煤灶要多三四倍以上，要是你單用一隻煤油爐去煮、一天功夫不必辦别的事，三頓飯已很夠你的忙碌了　　繁華的都市裏，有煤氣灶，電灶，自然是旣乾凈又省事，不過因爲耗費過鉅用的人很少，在内地更是絶無僅有了，姑且從略不談罷。</p>
<p>竈下的設備</p>
<p>其實人人都知道「食的問題」很重要，但是關於灶的設備，大都疏略太甚！不是設備不完全，便是常常會失散零落，東找西尋，切菜切每用以做别的工作。一塊抹布用處最多，襯禍端菜，擦油的刀，擦鍋，擦菜碗飯碗的水漬，在在離不了它，油膩污黑，永遠見不到乾凈的日子。可是「病從口入」對於食的問题，我們竟不講衛生的多，實在是可慮的事，那們改良竈下，應有灶下的設備。</p>
<p>主婦的責任</p>
<p>主婦主持中饋，是一句老話。究竟婦女應否操習烹調，是一個問題。不過主婦旣主持家政，食的問題以是人生的要素，那决不能便置之不問。可是時髦的主婦都不願意下廚房，其實下廚房並不卑鄙，歐美的主婦，大都能親自煮調，中國素稱考究「吃」的，爲什麽主婦們都不願意負一些責任？其實二三日入廚下，洗手作羹湯。」也是堂皇冠冕的事。</p>

<p>他皺了眉毛頓着脚道：呌你管，你不管，你看，閙我一身，現在你可以抱他了吧？袁氏笑着擔了孩子過去，連道：走罷，走罷，惹下禍事了。於是摟了孩子，跑到裏屋子裏去了。關耀武兩手牽了大衣呆着站在屋子中間，一步也走不得，口裏不住的喞咕着，殷得仁笑道：老趙，你瞧見没有？這就是個樂子。關耀武皺了眉道：說起來，眞是可氣。回得家來，不抱孩子吧？孩子是吵着要你抱，你抱過來吧？就是這樣了閙你一身。袁氏在屋子裏道：進來罷，讓我跟你擦擦呀。關耀武擺着頭牽着衣服走進去了。却聽到他夫妻兩人喁喁的又在裏面說話。袁氏道：你今天出城去了，知道那一天回來呢，多去幾個錢在家裏作零用罷。關耀武道：過年才有兩天，又要錢嗎？我過年才發八成餉，你倒和我要來個雙分。袁氏道：我還提過年呢。過年過年，把我零碎積攅下來的幾個錢，全墊着花了。說起來，你得拿錢出來還我呢。關耀武呌着道：我身上就只有這些錢，你都拿去了，我還用不用呢？袁氏呌起來道：我不管。說着話時，屋子裏有陣脚步忙亂的聲音，隨着關耀武紅着一張臉，跑了出來。趙自强道：怎麽了？你又和嫂子在辦交涉。關耀武摇着頭道：不必提了。皮夾子讓他搶去了。袁氏由屋子裏搶出來，笑道：二位别廳他的話。我過年要六七十塊錢開銷，他才給我三十塊錢，欠人的錢，那裏少得了呢，我只好拿出錢來墊着把債還了。現在把年關逃過來了，他倒不認賑，我能不把他的錢扣下來嗎？關耀武瞅着他的女人，有一句話想說出來，却又忍回去了，向他摇了幾摇頭道：今天若不是大年初二，我眞要說出什麽好的來了。走罷，出城去罷。關連長滿臉敢怒而不敢言的樣子，殷趙二人，也就只好跟了他走將出來。（六三）</p>

<h3>德人懋倫司博士講演概况（上）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>（我社會人士應注意近代科學之驚人現狀。）</p>
<p>德國漢堡。是德國的唯一商埠。宛如　國的上海。是萬商雲集的所在。而疾病種類。也較爲複雜。所以德國的熱帶病研究院。就設在漢堡大學裏面。有一個敎授。名呌懋倫司ＰＲＯＦＰＭＵＥＨＬＥＮＳ。他在歐戰時候。拿他研究細菌學衛生學的功夫。狠在軍隊裏和都市上做過一番事業。如今却在熱帶病院裏。考究生物學。細菌寄生蟲等重要門類。聲名赫。他和ＤＲＫＯＬＬＥ考來博士（就是同華色曼博士同發明梅毒血淸反應的人也是一個大家）及拿而博士ＤＲＫＮＯＬＬ等。都曾到過好幾處熱帶地方去實地考察。所以經騐實在豐富。此次應我國政府和醫學界之約。來華講學。並且隨帶了許多講演的材料。如幻燈片及活動影片之類。三星期前。分頭在上海寳隆醫院。與仁濟醫院。用德英二國文字。講演了六次之多。（題目是相同的）。在寳隆醫院講的六次裏面。不佞到了四次。如今我且把這四次裏所見所聞的記出來。要使社會人士。明瞭近代醫學的研究方法。以及已經達到了一種什麽境界。尤其要請舊醫先生們。靜氣平心的讀一讀。如果不信。則懋倫司還在南京。可以請他來使諸君廣廣眼界。不比海外奇談。一時無從對證。但本文將過細的專門名詞。過深的醫學理論。一概略去。以求通俗。而省筆墨。</p>
<p>第一個講題是「螺旋菌。ＳＰＩＲＯＣＨＡＥＴＡ。講了二天。並且除講菌的本身動作性質生活狀况以外。再講因這一類菌而所致的病象。諸君諒都知道。梅毒的病原。也就是一種螺旋菌的傳染。不過另有專名。呌作ＳＰＩＲＯＣＨＡＥＴＡＰＡＬＬＩＤＡ。但是另外幾種牙患。與急性黄疸病。也都是螺旋菌爲祟。在從前。研究螺旋菌的形狀。是用墨汁染色法。我們在一片黑的玻璃片上。可以看見白絲樣的螺旋菌體。後來用暗視野的方法。才可以看見螺旋菌的動作。這一次懋倫博士帶了一本最新的影片來。是將暗視野裏面的菌體動作。用顯微攝影法。拍入了影戲片子。或將培養的各種菌類狀况。拍出來。或以病人身上膿血。放在玻片上拍攝。這一種影片。放大以後。照樣可供千百人觀看。所以講演時候。有聲有色。連螺菌在人的皮肉上如何擾亂。血球在這是時候怎樣奮鬥。都一目了然。</p>
<p>自從這種菌體動作的研究。有進一步的成功以後。我我們可以由動作的不同。再去細分菌的種類。這一次懋倫所指示的ＲＥＣＵＲＲＥＮＳＳＰＩＲＯＣＨＡＥＴＡ回歸熱螺旋菌。和另外一種ＬＥＰＴＯＳＰＩＲＡ的動作。就大不相同。一個是像魚兒游水一樣的。一個是像蝗蚓般扭動的。我們倘然拿研究生物學的觀念巫說。丨在顯微鏡底下分别各種小生物的生活狀態。竟要如在地面上。分别驢馬一般。才稱得起「格物致知」咧。但是有幾種小螺菌。在普通人體的排洩物裏面。或膿血裏面。往往看不出。必須另注在動物的身上。（家兎之類）然後方可尋到。此篇恕不詳論了。</p>
<p>第三天第二個講題。是「世界大戰中的衛生學。」這天所講的。大致都是軍隊衛生。而許多戰時疾病的統計。他說戰爭時。有許多病。都從兵士身上的蝨子傳染。最著的。就是發疹傷寒。丨丨此外則蚊蟲傳染瘧疾。弄得兵士個個發熱。而减少戰鬥力。後來想法從事於捉蝨運動。撲蚊運動。由軍醫計劃。由總司令嚴飭照辦。居然大有成効。此外又講到戰時的營養問題。報告了些俘虜患肺癆病的統計。據他說。俄國所俘德兵。什之六七漸患肺癆。德國所俘俄俄兵。頗受醫學上的助力。而死亡較少。</p>
<p>那一天所示的幻燈。有許多野戰時臨時所製的軍衣消毒器等等。最簡單的。只用一只汽油空筒。中間架上木栅。下半盛水。底上砌石。掘坑。燒樹。也就可以乾蒸不少士兵的軍衣。而撲滅蝨子。一方還有臨時浴塲。簡單的也祇用木板架成。甚至用布圍起來就行了。士兵脫衣入浴。浴罷穿衣。衣服已經蒸過。此外馬鞍皮件。都用狠簡的法子滅蝨消毒。最多時候。一天可以使一萬兵身上驅蝨凈盡。有一個研究寄生學的醫師。曾經在那時候。數過一條背帶上的蝨卵。竟有六千餘枚之多。事雖不常。可見他們研究醫學的精神。</p>
<h3>怎樣維持身體的健康（下）</h3>
<p>— 江俊孫</p>
<p>（三）怎樣去維持你身體的健康？</p>
<p>上面說過，人好像一部汽車上的機器，必須時常加以檢騐，看看有没有小毛病，小螺絲釘鬆了没有，鬆了，弄弄緊，機器的何處有破損，應當加以修理，何處應當加油，勿使機器太熱，這種事情，應當個個人隨時注意，按時去請工程師檢查檢查，那麽小毛病可以馬上修好，大毛病亦不至於發生，人們的身體，亦何嘗不是這樣。可惜我中國人太不會用這部靈巧的機器，往往短壽夭折，又不信任工程師，部部機器想自己是個工程師，往往弄出大亂子來，多麽可惜！</p>
<p>講到按時檢查身體健康的情形，美國有種機關，我們想可取法，他們每年要檢查十萬多人，内中有一萬萬多個醫生服務，他們的檢查，分理學的，化學的，顯微鏡的，以及血淸，愛克司光等，没有一件不查到的，遇見有病的地方，在報告書上明白指出，并且還告訴他們以補救的方法，這樣子一來，大病化小病，小病化無病，延年益壽，不難達到。敝人在最近的將來，亦擬擔任這種工作，因爲他對於我民族健康，國家前途，狠關重要的啊！</p>
<h3>飲說三余</h3>
<p>— 雪岫</p>
<p>金匱於四飲之外，又有伏飲留飲之候曰，「其人背寒冷，如水大」又曰，「脇下痛，引缺盆，咳嗽則輒已，（一作轉甚，）又曰，「其人短氣而渴，四肢歷節痛，脈沈者，有留飲，」病源曰，由飲酒後飲水多，水氣停留於胸鬲之　，而不　散，乃令人脇下痛，短氣而潯，」千金曰，「留飲形不發作，無熱，脈徽，煩滿不能食，脈沈滑者，留飲病，病　留飲者，脇下瘧引缺盆，欬轉甚，其人欬而不得臥，引項上痛，欬者如小兒掣瘲狀，」又大五飲丸曰，」一曰留飲，停水在心下，」漢唐文獻之可徴者，略盡於此矣，金匱之背寒冷如水大之「如水大」三字，不成文理，脈經及千金方作「大如手」，是也，欬嗽則輒已之「輒已」二字，不可解，一作轉甚，是也，凡身體有痛，欬則牽動，痛必增劇，未有欬喇而痛反止者，脈經正作轉甚，當據以改正，千金方亦作轉甚，且其下又曰，「欬者如兒掣瘲狀，」此狀其欬嗽則轉甚之形也，若欬喇輒已，則其狀宜反安舒，何爲如掣瘲乎，總以上所述留飲之候，則背寒冷大如手也，脇下痛引缺盆，欬嗽則轉甚也，短氣而渴，四肢歷節痛也，形不發作，無熱，煩滿不能食也，欬而不得臥，引項上痛，欬者如小兒掣瘲狀也，其中脇下痛引缺盆，欬嗽轉甚之候，近於懸飮，短氣欬不得臥之候近於支飲，然支飲不渴，此渴，乃其不同之點也，形不發作者，其病候常如是，不甚有變化，非如溢飲之「有劇時」也，無熱者，明其非急性炎證也，煩滿不能食者，知其影響及於胃也，四肢歷節痛者，有多發性關節炎之候也，背寒冷大如手者，冐擴張之人，往往有此候，渴者，亦胃擴張病人所有之候也，欬如小兒掣瘲狀者，欬甚則掣痛，作勢以抵抗之也，今按多發性關節炎，屢多并發心藏内膜炎，故金匱中鳳歷節痛篇，言歷節如水傷心，蓋其病候，除肢節疼痛而外，如短氣，如脚腫，顯然爲心藏之病，與所謂支飲者相類，金匱旣謂支飲爲水在心，故亦謂歷節爲水傷心也，綜合各證，知古之所謂劉飲，非指一病而言，如懸飲，如支飲，以及歷節之有心瓣膜病者，皆歸之於留飲，非　　至於伏飲之候則曰，「膈上病痰，滿喘欬吐，發則寒熱，背痛腰疼，目泣自出，其人振振身瞤劇，」按金匱不單獨言痰，已於痰說中論之，此「病痰」二字欵誤，考脈經千金方及外臺秘要所引，「病痰」二字皆作「之病」，可證病痰二字，實爲金匱誤文，宜據脈經千金外臺以訂正之者也，伏飲病候之記述，此外不稪有所見，諸家妥說，紛紜不一，如徐可忠以爲即痰飲支飲之伏而不即發者，尤拙吾以爲是痰飲之伏而不覺者，朱明俊以爲即支飲之伏藏深久者，醫宗金鑑以爲是留飲伏而不出，即世俗所謂吼喘之病，然細按其病候，滿喘欬吐，乃其常有之證，即病不發作時，亦有是證也，寒熱背痛腰疼，目眩身瞤，爲其發時之候，即病不發作時，即無是證也，此非胃病也，胃病無寒熱，雖外臺引病源留飲宿食之候，有壯熱之語，千金前胡湯及蜜煎，有寒熱之語，此皆古人觀察不細密，述證多模糊这咎，以今病騐之，急性胃炎尙有發壯熱與傷寒相似者，慢性胃炎則無有也，至於喘及欬，更非冐病所常有矣，伏飲又非心病，心病雖亦有滿喘，然無「發則寒熱背痛腰疼」之候也，統觀伏飲之候，惟支氣管擴張足以當之，蓋擴張之部，中成窼囊，足以爲痰沬停潴之處，若停潴之痰，排泄不良，則起腐化而發寒熱，於是腰背疼痛，目眩身瞤，種種熱之副産物生矣，然則證候之中，有吐者，何也，曰，自嚴格言之，嘔吐爲排除胃内容之機能，欬唾爲排除肺及氣管内容之機能，然古人往往言唾爲吐，不如今之界限嚴謹也，金匱肺痿肺癰欬嗽上氣篇曰，「寸口脈數，其人欬，口中反有濁唾唌沬，」此涎沬之言唾也，然又曰，「肺痿，吐涎沬而不欬者，其人不渴，必遺尿，</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>小便數，」則涎沬又言吐矣，又曰，「欬睡膿血，脈數虚者爲肺痿，數實者爲肺癰，」此肺癰膿血之言唾也，然又曰，「病欬逆，脈之，何以知此爲肺癰，當有膿血，吐之則死，」則肺癰膿血，又言吐矣，又曰，「畜結癰膿，吐如米粥，」此亦肺癰之膿言吐之證也，然則伏飲之所謂「欬吐，」即「欬唾」也，又何欵乎其爲肺及氣管之病乎，然金鑑謂即今之吼喘，則非是，以吼喘無寒熱故也</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答（八）</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>問隔日熱和四日熱的發作期間怎樣一定的？</p>
<p>答隔日熱在四十八小時後；四日熱在七十二小時後再發第二回熱，以後便照這樣反復發作的。但有時在次回發作，比較預定時間早一二小時的。也有一部分在二十四小時後就發作而變成天天發熱的，呌做重複隔日熱或重複四日熱。</p>
<p>問惡性瘧是不是發生於熱帶地方的？答惡性瘧本來是發生於熱帶地方的。但近年來上海附近也有時發見，大概因爲從南洋或别的熱帶地方來的人民携帶過來的。</p>
<p>問惡性瘧的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答發惡性瘧的時候、並没有激烈的戰慄，僅有惡寒，就起體温上昇，而熱度留着約二十四小時到四十八小時之久。間歇數十小時再發第二次的發作。體温上昇之外，還有脈搏頻數，嗜眠，譫語，脾腫，肝腫，黄疸，匐行疹等。</p>
<p>問瘧疾有慢性的嗎？</p>
<p>答有的。慢性瘧，大都是從惡性瘧轉移而成的。熱型很不規則，因爲赤血球破壞而呈强度的貧血，肝脾腫大，皮膚現　黄色。則後來陷於惡液質（雖不發熱，但營養衰退，心悸亢進，呼吸促迫，慢性泄瀉，浮腫，衂血，皮下出血等。</p>
<p>問瘧疾還有他種變狀嗎？</p>
<p>答有一種呌假面瘧的，是没有發熱，或發微熱，没有一定的間歇而發别的病狀，像神經痛，心痛，腹痛，間或失神痙等，但常見脾臟腫大。問這種假面瘧，在什麽地方最多？</p>
<p>答温暖的地方很多。</p>
<p>問瘧疾對於生命怎麽樣？</p>
<p>答隔日熱和四日熱，没有危險；惡性熱，比較的兇險。</p>
<p>問治療瘧疾有没有特效藥？</p>
<p>答治療瘧疾的特效藥，就是奎寗（俗名金鷄納霜）因爲他有殺滅血中瘧疾胞子蟲的能力的緣故。</p>
<p>問奎寗怎樣服法？</p>
<p>答在發作前三四小時服用半克的鹽酸奎寗；如果發熱停止後，還須連服十多天每天服用二三次每次○·二克。</p>
<p>問奎寗可以直接注射到血管裏嗎？</p>
<p>答遇到重病的時候，可用來注射靜脈内。</p>
<p>問奎寗劑内服或注射没有效力時，應當怎樣？</p>
<p>答可同時服用或注射砒素劑，或注射九一四，或試用一種新製劑奎諾撲瘧母星。</p>
<p>問怎樣預防瘧疾？</p>
<p>答預防瘧疾，在乎驅除瘧蚊。家中附近不可瀦積污水，以防蚊蟲繁殖。睡床用蚊帳，窗戶加紗窗，以免蚊蟲的螯剌。</p>
<h3>科學的達生篇（十六）</h3>
<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>變更編制聲明本編陸續刊載以來，頗蒙各界函電推許，敢不用以自勵，本因全稿完成、行將付印單行本、惟查題名旣稱「科學的達生編」，乃爲新時代普及民衆的一種讀物，而旣發表各章，間有産科助産方面之講習性質，似不盡適於普及閱讀，是以重行改編，以期適合民衆需要，爲唯一之目標。除將前部各節改編之文，另日印就，發表於單行本外，嗣後本報所載，完全係照改編者繼續發表，尙希關心本編緒公，有以見諒爲幸。</p>
<p>（十）（三）産後一般的處置</p>
<p>（甲）産褥的定義</p>
<p>由於妊娠分娩所起的肉體變化，在分娩後以迄恢復原狀的時期，就稱所謂産褥期，此種産褥期，平均有六個星期之久，尋常以月經再潮，就算産褥终了的標識，産婦由正規的經過，以達産褥，當然一帆風順，毋庸過慮，但是因分娩所受的肉體變化，究屬非輕，假使偶有不愼，勢必貽患無窮，所以産褥中的處置的攝生，亦不可不加以注意，</p>
<p>（乙）就褥的久暫</p>
<p>分娩後至少須就褥一二星期，起初數日，宜取仰臥位，以防空氣竄入子宫，嗣後如果子宫收縮伴良，惡露正常，那末，可以隨意側臥，在一星期以内，所有飤食哺乳，大小便的排泄，均以不離床褥爲妥，假使起立過早，恐因子宫尙未收縮，靭帶尙未堅整，或有子宫轉位下埀脫出以及出血之患，總之，必須根據子宫收縮的狀態，惡露發現的質量，方可解决離床的遲早，意思就是惡露稀淡，子宫恢復，以迄恥骨縫上不能按摸，若至此時，方可離床，</p>
<p>（丙）惡露的排泄</p>
<p>甚麽是惡露？就是在産褥中，由生殖器排出的一種液汁，産後一二日，有暗赤色的惡露，這是血性惡露，第三日後流出，漸有漿液，現淡紅色，這是漿液性惡露，第八日後，粘液中白血球漸多，現灰白色，這是白色惡露，第三星期以後，排洩的只不過透明稀薄的粘液，以迄第四星期，排洩完全停止，大抵授乳婦的惡露少的時間短，不授乳婦的惡露多而延長，</p>
<p>（丁）子宫的收縮</p>
<p>後陣痛乃是子宫收縮的一種原因，初起疼痛較强，嗣後减弱，以迄産褥期的第二三日，完全消息，至多亦不過五日，分娩完畢後，子宫就起收缩，子宫底部，處於臍下約十一生的米達，經過二三小時，漸向上升，而達臍窩，第二三日，漸次下降至臍下，第五日至恥骨縫與臍之間第九第十日，匿入恥骨縫之後，及至第十二日，完全潛入小骨盤中，至第六星期，恢復妊娠前的原狀，</p>
<p>腹帶可以防止腹壁的弛緩，並可以促進子宫的收縮，簡易的使用法，可在腹壁置上棉花四五層，再用軟布圍而縛之，</p>
<h3>述肺部之梅毒</h3>
<p>— 梁俊靑</p>
<p>肺部之梅毒發生於梅毒第三期，前人以爲乃罕見之梅毒症象，其實臨診時若留意診察，則必詫異其數見不鮮，蓋其症象絶似肺癆，醫者若不留意，往往誤診爲肺癆也，按梅毒之發於肺部，初不明顯，僅有咳嗽，胸前苦悶，胸骨疼痛等症狀，病者身體日益瘦弱，胃口逐漸低減，其後則痰中帶血，多少不一，呼吸感覺困難，有時發熱甚高，有時則微覺發熱，所吐之痰除帶血外多半爲膿液性，此時病者每以爲肺癆症（即肺結核症）而求診於醫者，而醫者聽其病情如上述，檢騐其肺部有氣管性呼吸或水泡音，以愛克司光照之有空洞或浸潤性病灶，往往亦不假思索，以爲乃第二期或第三期之肺癆症，於是乎日光療，太陽燈療，氣胸術療，營養療，藥物療，氣候療，諸如此類，不一而足，而病狀日益加重，甚至氣急痰湧而死，一般人猶惜其求治太晚，以致不救，其實寃也，</p>
<p>至其診斷因症象與肺癆相似頗不容易，診者除注意其已往病歷外，並須檢查其身體有無梅毒徴象，若病者喉頭有類似梅毒性潰瘍，或瞳孔反射消失，或膝蓋骨筋反射消失，以及其他梅毒象徴，同時肺部又有上述現象，則必須施行華氏梅毒血淸反應檢騐，在必要時須舉行腦脊髓水之華氏梅毒反應檢騐，有時華氏之梅毒血淸反應可以呈顯負性，此時可注射零四五之獅牌九一四以激動之，然後取血檢騐，若係梅毒，則必顯正性之華氏反應，有人謂用愛克司光檢騐可以診斷肺部梅毒症，其實非富有經騐之肺病學專家不能辨之，蓋肺部之梅毒雖在愛克司光片上有濃厚之背影呈顯於氣管分枝處爲其特徴，然其病灶往往在肺尖或銷骨下亦有之，有時且有萎縮性條紋或空洞，極易被人誤認爲肺癆也，總之診斷肺部之梅毒症必須注意病人以前有無梅毒傳染之可能，其身體各處有無梅毒徴象，同時參考其華氏之梅毒反應以及目前肺部之種種症象，則其診斷不易致誤，有時眞正之肺癆症患者亦可同時染有梅毒，此時可注射九一四驅梅毒劑以覘之，若其肺部之症象不退，同時痰内又檢得結核菌，則知其肺部之症象乃因肺癆而起，並非肺部有梅毒之侵蝕，善通人對於曾經傳染之梅毒往往諱莫如深，其實若其梅毒發作於肺部，則必給予醫者以診斷方面之困難，反可自誤，願社會人士注意及之，（完）</p>
<h3>民衆對於「痧藥水」應有之認識（下）</h3>
<p>— 毛啟昆</p>
<p>便秘當然不是絶對不要緊的病症。有時會因便秘而發生另一種疾患；有時亦僅爲某一病的一種症候。前者如以便秘而誘發「痔核」，「慢性腸炎」，及腸肌因之麻痺，而發生「腸嵌頓」……等症。小則帶病終身，大則足以危險生命。後者如患「傷寒」者每多便秘；或以内臓下埀，腸壁弛緩，子宫後屈，直腸癌等而有顯著之便秘，亦更有倒前者因果而便秘者。醫者遇之，猶未敢貿然從事，必經詳細之診察，而一般人竟多以身試藥，殊可惜也。要知夏季之便秘。類多以流汗過多，腸内缺少水分：或以消化不良爲其誘因；或以貪食生冷發生冐腸炎病，致失排便機能；或以腸肌過敏，蠕動亢進，有時亦足發生便秘。同時每覺口乾舌燥，噁心頭痛，甚有四肢如冰，麻木抽筋者。以致多誤認爲痧，而乞靈於痧藥水，正如上例之自尋苦惱。爲欲求閱者了解起見，乃不覺辭之過費。今當言歸正傳，更述其他。</p>
<p>某婦，中夜腹痛，起如厠，微瀉。服痧藥水而痛減。然終覺腹部脹滿，時有便意，不獲成眠，聞說鴉片有止痛，消脹，催眠之功。覓得之，已而果效。越日寒熱大作，腹痛尤烈。初猶未肯就醫，方視痧藥水爲至寳。斷漸不支，乃投醫院。診之，似痢。騐之果然。</p>
<p>治痢之法，固無論新舊，必先通便。若彼婦者，先之以痧藥水，繼之以鴉片。與治療之正規，相背而馳，其不自陷於絶地者幾然。此又一例。</p>
<p>某孩，方呀呀學語。忽腹瀉而吐。家人投以痧藥水，竟長眠不醒。來院時氣息僅續。診察之下，中毒之症象頗顯著。詢之，知曾給以痧藥水。問幾何？曰：「眞眞一些些」。出瓶騐之，而所謂「眞眞一些些」者，殆已將近半瓶矣丨告以服藥過多，勢難挽救。則凄然欲涕，爽然若失。猶自訝「所給些微，何竟得如此？」</p>
<p>若而人者，以吾所見，不知凡幾丨其觀念錯誤之焦點，厥惟「藥灌滿腸」一語，有以害之丨其實若輩又何嘗想到，「一升米的飯與一升米的粥」，雖然做出來的量有兩樣，而「米」都是「一升」。「一碗厚粥與一碗薄粥」，雖然是同樣的「一碗」，可是内容所含「米」，確有了多少不同。又何怪他門拿服「舊藥」丨丨煎劑的觀念，來服用「已經提煉精製」的「新藥」丨吾特鄭重提出，務望讀者注意丨固不僅服用「痧藥水」須注意丨其他一切「新藥」均不能隨己意爲增减丨必須按正規方法使用丨尤其對於「孩童」，更應愼重將事丨庶不負本人之嘵舌。</p>
<p>其他如確屬「霍亂症」，或别種疾患。而因迷信「痧藥水」，致「誤　」，及因之而失去良好之治療時期者，更屬普遍之現象。</p>
<p>諸君讀吾篇至此，當能「了然認識痧藥水」爲何物？以之備一時之急救或有之，若視之爲「萬病回春」之妙丹，則謬誤矣！</p>
<p>復次，吾更有所希望者：</p>
<p>（一）有管理藥品發行之責者，應嚴加取締市售之不合正規之制劑，以免危害社會。旣經檢騐認爲可予發行者，應飭令將該劑之「處方」明白刊布：治何種疾病？服用時，應禁忌之事項；每次之用量，及最多之限量；尤以連續服用應隔若干時間，及不得超過若干定量之標準以便使用者，不致「弄巧成拙」，而有所遵循。</p>
<p>（二）痧藥水之製劑，旣不能劃一不二。各家所出，配合自有出入。是（一）項所陳自屬重要。一般藥商固應鄭重其事，一般自命爲「樂善好施」之士，亦應加以相當注意。遇有不識字，或下愚之人，務必爲詳細說明，庶免有誤，亦屬功德無量！</p>

<h3>多難之月</h3>
<p>— 丁萌</p>
<p>前月底的報章上，多說五月是「多難之月」。這名目，以前是没有見過的。現在這「多難之月」已經臨頭了。從經過了的日子來想一想，不錯，五一是「勞動節」，可以說很有些「多難」；五三是濟南慘案紀念日，也當然屬於「多難」之一的。但五四是新文化運動的發揚，五五是革命政府成立的佳日，爲什麽都包括在「難」字堆裏的呢？這可眞有點兒希奇古怪！</p>
<p>不過只要將這「難」字，不作國民「受難」的「難」字解，而作令人「爲難」的「難」字解，則一切困難，可就渙然冰釋了。</p>
<p>時勢也眞改變得飛快，古之佳節，後來自不免化爲難關。先前的開會，是聽大衆在空地上開的，現在却要防人「乘機搗亂」了，所以只得函請代表，齊集洋樓，還要由軍警維持秩序。先前的要人，雖然出來要「淸道」（俗名「凈街」），但還是走在地上的，現在却更要防人「謀爲不軌」了，必得坐着飛機，須到出洋的時候，纔能放心送給朋友。名人逛一淌古董店，先前也不算奇事情，現在却「微服」「微服」的嚷得人耳聾，只好或登名山，或入古廟，比較的免掉大驚小怪。總而言之，可靠的國之柱石，已經多在半空中，最低限度也上了高樓峻嶺了，地主就只留着些可疑的百姓，實做了「下民」，且又民匪難分，一有慶弔，總不免「假名滋擾」，向來雖靠「華洋兩方當局，先事嚴防」，没有鬧過什麽大亂子，然而總比平時費力的，這就令人爲難，而五月也成了「多難之月」，紀念的是好是壞，日子的爲戚爲喜，都不在話下。</p>
<p>但願世上大事件不要增加起來；但願中國裏慘案不要再有，但願也不再有什麽政府成立；但願也不再有偉人的生日和忌日增添。否則，日積月累。不久就會成個「多難之年」，不但華洋當局，老是爲難，連我們走在地面上的小百姓，也只好永遠身帶「嫌疑」，奉陪戒嚴，嗚呼哀哉３不能喘氣了。</p>
<h3>我也來談談中國的國民性</h3>
<p>— 契</p>
<p>我近來把中國的所謂「國民性」，細細地加了一番歷史的研究，結果，不能不跟着高倡「民族復興」的人們，喊一聲「偉大！」</p>
<p>依我的研究，中國的國民性，是最能犧牲的，最顧大局的，總之，是最具有「大國民的風範」的。依照中國士大夫們的邏輯方法，是只要舉出少少的幾個人的「豐功偉烈」，就可遮蓋了一個時代的國民性的。因爲，有這少數人先「以身作則」「樹之楷模」的做起來，依照「正心，修身，齊家，治國，平天下」的順序，當然那一個時代當中，就不會有胡適博士所謂具有劣根性的人民了。現在，就舉兩位足以代表中國國民性的人物，做一個證例。</p>
<p>「犧牲民族英雄的美名」，和志願一跳火坑」的人，當然是頂頂肯犧牲的人。有這樣的「大無畏精神」的人，歷史上恐怕要算秦檜「首屈一指」。秦檜因爲犧牲了「民族英雄的美名」，所以，他的鐡像，會跪在西湖給萬人唾駡。事實上，他當時那種「苦心孤詣」和「排除萬難」的勇氣，自己也覺得是在那裏「跳火坑」。只可惜當時胡野和後代的人們，對他始終不肯原諒！</p>
<p>歷史上頂頂能夠「顧全大局」的人，要算是吳三桂了！你想，那時李自成領導下的一羣流寇，「殺人放火」，何等猖獗？倘使讓他們那樣的胡鬧下去，中國民族還有瞧類嗎？吳先生就因爲要保全中國民族的一線生機，才請淸兵入關，「滅此醜類。」固然淸兵的殺人放火，還遠在流寇之上，然而，到底淸太祖是個「眞命天子」，他燒殺之後，自能奠定中原的呀，並且，幾百年之後，他的子孫不還是把好好的一個民族，交還給我們了嗎？所以，吳先生的算盤，實在不錯！而秦吳二位老先生的氣量，對於「大國民」的徽號，誰還能說受之有愧？</p>
<p>本來，歷史的意義，是隨着時代變遷的。商鞅和王安石，在康梁主張變政的時候，居然也抬過頭。目下的時代，依照某方面發出來的電報，所謂「赤匪」的流毒，眞是不亞　明末的流寇丨所以有人主張即使不積極的請日本兵進來帮同我們「剿匪」，儘不妨消極的讓他們進來鞏固我們的「後防」。不過，在這個關頭，我們做老百姓的却要想一想，究竟明末的人民，是應該帮同李自成打吳三桂呢，還是應該帮同吳三桂打李自成？</p>
<h3>一天</h3>
<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>在櫉窗裏，汽車天天從朝到夜，從夜到朝地，望着窗外的街上有許多别的汽車在疾馳，在緩步：車上有老爺，有太太，有小姐，有你爺，還有的時候有狗，都很可愛，他尤其喜歡的是狗，蔑視一切似地蹲着，無目的似地向前凝視着，彷彿就連他身旁的主人也不在他的心目中似地。他不知道他們從那里去載了這些人或狗來，載了這些人或狗又在奔向那里去。他眞羨慕他們，這樣地自由飛跑着。他偷倫地望了望停在他左右的兩輛汽車，也像他一樣地在埀頭喪氣。</p>
<p>一天，幸運臨到了他，他如願地得到了一個駕御他的主人，把他從牢獄似的櫉窗中拯救了出來。於他什麽都是新奇，他快活，他感激他的主人。他很忠心地爲他的主人馳驅，有時路跑短了，他覺得有些歉意，似首主人太體貼了他。剛才他馳過那他久住過的櫉窗，看見他的兩個伴侣依舊在那里，只地位稍稍移動了一些。他很同情他們，怎麽到這時還没有出去見世面。一分心，他忘了招呼他們，連頭都没有輕微地點一點，彷彿他並不同他們相識，或者相識而並没有見到他們似地。他覺得他們在抱憾地望着他。他太鹵忙了，他在悔恨地自責着。他希望不久再會經過那里，去請求他們寛恕他這次的疏忽。</p>
<p>可是，不知從什麽時候起，他已消失了那馳騁的愉快。他又感到他的主人太不顧憐他。剛從一個什麽會集跑進車房，休鄎　没有多久，又要送小主人上學去了。還時常地給雨淋着，雖說是春大，却也很有些寒意。而且儘這樣跑算什麽呢？難道這就是究竟？這不是比以前更丨不，他並不想回到櫉窗去，他已嘗夠了那種滋味。他想丨他想什麽？他想他有些不大敢說，同對面來的什麽車撞一下。有一次，他看見前面有一輛車駛來，很漂亮，車中的人看來也並不使他厭惡，他便低着頭，沉着心，一半恐懼，一半希冀地向前直撞；可是，不知怎麽一來，竟没有撞到。他失望，他抱怨着車主人。</p>
<p>現在，同什麽來車相撞，可說是他的唯一的希望。</p>
<h3>從外國回來的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 達伍</p>
<p>一個從外國住了十幾年後回來的朋友，近日時常跑來向我訴苦，說中國的生活過不慣。譬如大便，馬桶旣蹲不來，而遍上海打鑼也尋不出一個乾凈的公厠所。一到上海，起首就一星期不能大便，後來學習了蹲馬桶，但也要三天後方能解一次，眞像上斷頭台，下滚油鍋，頗有些熬煎不住。</p>
<p>於是我告訴他，這是他没有習慣的緣故。但要是有錢，上海也還是可以舒服的，不過不能像外國那麽便宜罷了：工人可以乘汽車上工，用抽水馬桶大便。因爲「中國是苦命的中國，中國人是苦命的中國人，」以大喻小，譬如國難，我們就「要安排吃苦，」不呌，也許國難可救，一呌，「便有亡國的危險」所以大便不出，第一義也只有「沉默，」否則也許要「不許大便，如違送捕的。」</p>
<p>那位朋友又向我訴述别的種種苦楚：上電車要爭先後，買東西要爭價錢，否則常常吃虧，例如：一天，到郵局去發掛號信，因爲照外國習慣，自己挨着次序，但别人却搶先去了，結果足足等了一個鐘頭纔把信發掉；又一天乘黄包車，被拉到半途，放下來要加錢，……之類。</p>
<p>我說這也是没有辦法的，等一等習慣了，自然没有困難。中國同胞，即使由政學商各界在「道德字典」中揀選一百字，呌人奉爲信條，「維持道德，挽回人心，」也無辦法。倘使和你一道去買郵票的人也和你一樣有機會到外國去住十幾年，拉黄包車的也和你一樣有錢乘車，中國早已由「苦命」變爲「好命」了，何必一面抵抗，一面交涉？所以如今「苦命是注定了」的，要安排吃苦，不要呌苦。</p>
<p>那位朋友摇摇頭，慘然而去。</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— julesrenard作林取譯</p>
<p>一撮頭髮</p>
<p>星期日，雷辟克家的迫令她的兩個孩子去做彌撒。他們被人家打扮得漂漂亮亮；姐兒愛勒絲丁冒着自己不及梳裝的危險，親自主持他們的裝飾事宜。她給他們選擇領帶，替他們磨刮指甲，爲他們分配祈禱害。丨她把最厚的一册分給紅蘿蔔鬚。但最緊要的是給她的兄弟擦生髮膏。</p>
<p>她對於這事眞有着一種狂熱。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚雖然隨她擺佈，毫無異言，但大哥斐利克斯却警告妹妹說，再要這樣，他會動怒的。因此，她便騙他：</p>
<p>「這次我忘記了，」她說，「我不是有意做的，我對你發誓：從下星期日起，不再給你擦生髮膏了。」</p>
<p>而她却老是想方設計給他擦上一點點。</p>
<p>「總有一天會要閙出禍事來的。」大哥斐利克斯說。</p>
<p>這天早上，因爲他正低頭揩臉，所以姐兒愛勒絲丁雖又使着詭計，他却一點都没看出。「你看，我現在聽你的話了，」她說，「你再不會咕嚕什麽了，你瞧生髮油缸子蓋得緊緊的擱在壁爐上面啦。我還不好嗎？其實我没有什麽　勞。紅蘿蔔鬚的頭髮是要水門汀才能粘住的，但對於你，生髮膏完全没有用處。你的頭髮自然捲曲着，蓬鬆着。你的頭好像一窩菜花一樣，這條紋路可以留到晚上還不會亂。」</p>
<p>「難爲你了，」大哥斐利克斯說。</p>
<p>他毫不疑心地站起身來。他忘記像平常一樣，把手在頭上摸一摸試試看。</p>
<p>姐兒愛勒絲丁替他穿好了衣服，把他裝飾起來，給他一雙白絲手套。</p>
<p>「好了嗎？」大哥斐利克斯說。</p>
<p>「你漂亮得像一個王子。」姐兒愛勒絲丁說，「你現在祗差一頂帽子。你自已到衣櫃裏面去拿罷。」</p>
<p>可是大哥斐利克期弄錯了。他在櫃門上照了一下。他連忙跑到碗櫃那邊去，打開碗櫃，抓了一隻盛滿着水的飯桌上用的玻瓶，從容不迫地傾在自己的頭上。</p>
<p>「我早就警告過你了，我的妹妹」他說。「我不歡喜别人拿我開頑笑的。你這一點點大，還不夠欺弄一個富有閱歷的老人呢。如果你再是這樣，我便便跳到河裏去洗掉你的生髮膏。」　　他的頭髮弄平了，他星期日穿的漂亮衣服水淋淋地全給弄濕了，他等着别人去替他更換或讓太陽來曬乾，隨便怎樣都好，在他是一樣。</p>
<p>「多麽厲害的人啊！」紅蘿蔔鬚心裏想，他滿懷欽佩，簡直看呆了。「他什麽人都不怕，如果我也照他的樣去做，那一定會笑痛人肚子的。還是讓他們以爲我並不厭惡生髮膏的好罷。」</p>
<p>可是當紅蘿蔔鬚以一種習慣了的心情忍耐着的時候，他的頭髮却偷偷在給他報仇了。那些被人用力按倒后頭髮，在生髮膏的壓迫之下，暫時像是死了一樣；隨後漸漸復活了，由於一種無形的推動，他們造出了一塊薄而放光的浮彫，它們把這浮彫裂開來，挖下去。這恰像一座正在融化的結着冰的茅屋。</p>
<p>祇一會兒功夫，那第一撮頭髮便挺直的，無拘無碍的，翌立在空中。</p>

<h3>上海金融市場之危徴魏友棐</h3>
<p>本文所謂上海金融市塲之危徴者，亦卽全國一般的危徴。其最顯著的徴狀是（一）金融滯呆，（二）資金向外流出。</p>
<p>今年一四期，（從一月到三月）上海方面的銀元移動狀况，表示逐漸在增多着，下面是一張統計：（單位萬元）</p>
<p>（移入）</p>
<p>漢口四九五重慶四九九江一九八宜昌三六</p>
<p>南怠一九二天津三０温州一九０鎭江二一</p>
<p>新銀元一八六長沙二０靑島一八五蚌埠二五</p>
<p>厦門一四一洛陽二０許州一００安慶一０</p>
<p>無湖八七牛莊一０杭州八五</p>
<p>（移出）</p>
<p>大連一五０天津一００秦皇島二０</p>
<p>杭州四０芝罘二０</p>
<p>移入的總數是二千○八十萬元，移出的總數是三百三十萬元，成一個六三與之比。爲什麽内地的銀元只是向上海方面輸送呢？不外乎下列三種原因：</p>
<p>（一）農村經濟的破産每年的絲繭節，是金融界發旺的季節，因爲那時銀元的用途最大，利率可以漲高，銀行和錢莊就可以此時相機成交，這幾年絲繭的市塲破産，滬杭和滬寗鐡路一帶，可以說没一處不需要欵項的接濟，在金融界一方面的地位，可以說，没一處可以放欵。爲什麽兩方面成一個相反的情形呢。在内地，平日差不多是全靠農作物以及副産品爲资本的，農産物的不况，農人，工人，以及商人都得停頓起來，他們是不是要資本的接濟呢？金融界方面，向來所以運欵於内地者，也不過以農作物爲一種担保，而今農作物一方面失依據。爲放欵之安全計，是否將裏足不前呢？因這兩種關係，已放的欵就得到期收回，預備放出的欵也就不放了，因此上海方面的銀元只有加多，没出路出。</p>
<p>（二）國際貿易收支不平衡這原因也是根據第一個原因發生的。連年的水災，共匪擾亂，農作物的跌價，造成農村經濟的破産。農民的購買力固然大爲薄弱而且節省了，可是日常用品，如煤油洋布疋頭，仍不得不仰給於外國，在平年，自然洋貨進口來得多，但土貨之出口，也可以抵冲一些，今年是不能了，只有向内地去的貨，末有從内地運出來的貨，因此銀元只有運到上海來買進口貨，一批一批地增加。</p>
<p>（二）内地存戶心理之恐慌這是一種特殊情狀，内地的存戶通常絶相信上海的金融機關，就是在滬戰期内，上海方面的存欵，也並不動摇，因爲内地的不安全，存戶基於上述心理，就運到上海來存儲，也是加多的一原因，</p>
<p>如此，内地的情形，是需要金融界的接濟，可是一方面資金只是向上海方面流出。至於上海方面呢，也是没法使資金活潑的，也只有兩種去路，一種是做投機，一種是流到國外去，　　上海方面對於銀元存額之增加，去路之阻滯，就只有做投機。最顯著的是做地産交易；連年地産價格的突飛猛進，就是這些資金呆滯的結果，一種虚浮的長進。無論什麽交易，他的價格的向前或下落，往往是要過其眞實情形的，地産也是如此，惟其太活躍了太旺氣了。當時大量收買的，都覺脫手爲難。已經買了不能脫手的，又不能看着一塊空地生利息，便不得不從建築方面以謀租賃之收入。根據本埠地産公司的報告，一四期内，地産的交易不見發旺，而建築界則漸轉好况。就是爲了一時難沽的原因。</p>
<p>近年建築界尤有一種辦法，譬如地産商人，他可以先將地産向金融界抵押借欵作爲建築資本，建築之後，又可以將房屋再抵押借欵作爲活動資本，所以建築事業也是虚的，建築的租賃只有向上，而生活力不見增加，生計就更加困難。</p>
<p>這種情形，自然不是好現狀，用投機來代替投資，是以資本爲逍遣，而金融界對於大量不動産押欵，一遇恐慌便有使金融周轉不靈之弊。本年美國的金融恐慌風潮，其起因在於擠兌，擠兌的原因，則爲資金缺乏，而美國銀行因産業破産的結果，承做大量不動産押欵，亦僞周轉不靈原因之一。其他各種投機市塲之躍起，亦基於金融呆滯的緣故，地産其一而已。</p>
<p>上海存在欵項有一無終底的去路，那就是流到國外去。這全是基於國際貿易入超的緣故。上海辦理華洋銀行收解機關的統計，，就是華商方面的存底，天天只有减少；解與洋商銀行之欵，天天只有增加。所以金融狀况的公式，是農村向通商口岸流出，通商口岸向外國流出，這是不是金融界之危徴，是不是國民經濟的致命傷呢？</p>
<p>外貨傾銷之對策</p>
<p>王逢辛</p>
<p>外貨傾銷與吾國國民生産及銷費經濟之關係，已詳拙著「外貨傾銷與國民經濟」一文，（見四月十七日本刊）茲請一述外貨倾銷之對策如次：</p>
<p>各國貨物，向以吾國市塲爲尾閭。近年各國經濟恐慌，貨物銷路日溢，國際商業競爭，頗有愈演俞烈之勢，舉凡關稅之提高也，金本位制之放棄也，貨物之向外傾銷也，無一而非各國經濟戰爭之堅甲利兵。吾國連年内戰，民不聯生，最近外侮踵至，國勢貼危，在此種情形之下，吾基礎薄弱之國貨工業，猶如病人膏盲之人，卽不遭任何打擊，亦已朝不保暮。今外貨變本加厲，挾其跌價之貨幣，與夫雄厚之實力，不顧血本，傾銷吾國，是無異拳足交加，其有不召顚躓喪亡者幾希矣。外貨傾銷之嚴重，及其對於吾國國民經濟之危害旣若是。吾國果願聽天由命，坐以待斃，斯亦已矣，不然，預須於可能範圍内，妥籌應付辦法，雖不能完全抵制外貨之傾銷，但至少足以抑制其傾銷之程度。至詳細辦法，可從政府社會及國貨工業本身三方面言之。</p>
<p>先就政府方面言之，則一曰從速厲行外貨傾銷稅法也，吾國傾銷稅法，業經公佈，而傾銷審查委員會，亦已由財政部曁實業部，派員組成，深望政府執法以繩，切實施行，俾外貨以納稅多，成本重，而不能爲無限制之傾銷，同時，吾國貨工業，亦可賴以有一線之生機。唯吾人於此有不可不注意者數端，（一）反傾銷立法，ＡＮＴＩ－ＤＵＭＰＩＮＧＬＥＧＩＳＬＡＴＩＯＮ有强制與任意兩種，任意反傾銷立法，於執行時，較有柔性，而强制反傾銷立法，則較含剛性，吾國反傾銷立法，究以何者爲宜，要須衡情酌理而后定，唯吾國反傾銷立法之目的，旣在抵禦各種外貨之傾銷，則似以柔性爲宜。且剛性反傾銷立法，手續冗繁，費用浩大，故以經濟眼光觀之，亦以柔性爲較勝一着也。（二）反傾銷立法不外規定傾銷外貨，課以特稅。唯此種稅率，究不何者爲宜，誠一問題。其較爲合理者，莫若所訂傾銷稅，相等於該傾銷外貨之本國市價與出口價値間之差額，俾其售價於課稅後，得與國内售價相近，而吾國貨，可不蒙重大影響。（三）外貨製造廠，非盡在本國，於吾國境内設廠製造者，不乏其例。在此種特殊情形下。設吾國反傾銷立法，祇規定由各本國輪入之外貨，而置吾國境内製造之傾銷外貨於不顧，亦非計之得者。故不論於吾國境内，或於本國製造之傾銷外貨，均須徴以傾銷稅，抑又進者，政府之施行傾銷稅，亦祇爲治標辦法而已，故二曰切實保護國貨工業也。吾政府之保護國貨工業，祗見於辭令，而未證諸事實。且舉事實所示，適與保護背道而馳，以言捐稅，則對於國貨工業，未見有若何之優待也；以云運輸，則運輸機關亦未嘗予國貨工業若何便利也；最近紗廠減工，厥因固多，而據局内人云，則統稅之不利於華商紗廠，以及鐡路運費之過高，亦爲其重要原因。居今之日，吾國果欲對付外貨之傾銷，在消極方面，當厲行外貨傾銷稅法；而在積極方面，尤當切實保護國貨工業，以增加其頡頏外貨傾銷之力量。</p>
<p>其次，就社會方面言之，則一曰金融機關　助國貨工業也。吾國國貨工業基礎之薄弱，至爲顯明，凡處金融機關地位者，允宜就能力所及範圍内，加以物質之援助，讀最近中國銀行及上海銀行報告書，得悉兩銀行對於國貨工業放欵，爲數甚鉅，然就全體國貨工業言之，仍屬杯水車薪，所望各金融機關，體念國貨工業之艱危，多加　助，則其有裨於國計民生者，豈非淺鮮哉，二曰人民養成購用國貨之習慣也。輓近國人崇尙奢華，喜用外貨，而於國産，輒加鄙視，是亦予外貨以傾銷之良機。冀吾國人，大澈大悟，培養購用國貨之習憤，而不斤斤於外貨之價廉物美，則其足以消極抵制外貨之傾銷，固不待智者而後知也。</p>
<p>最後就國貨工業本身言之，則一曰改善内部之管理也，二曰滅低貨物之成本也，三曰改良貨物之品質也。凡此三瑞，雖卑之無足高論，然吾國貨工業。果能蠲嫌釋疑，團結一致，造或民族資本集團，致力於管理及製造之改良，則於有形無形　，可得增加實力，充厚基礎。於是外貨傾銷，可得從容應付，力圖爭紥，决不致如今日之束手無策，坐以待斃矣。</p>
<p>吾國農村經濟，已告破産，今國内經濟界，猶得奄奄一息者，厥惟一般新興之國貨工業是賴。設此碩果僅存之國貨工業，亦受外貨傾銷之打擊，而致一蹶不起，行見吾國民經濟，將入於土崩瓦解之境，興言及此，不寒而慄，深望政府國人以及國貨工業，急起圖之。</p>
<p>何謂生産唐慶增</p>
<p>生産者何？創造或增加財富效用之謂也，自然物如水火木石等，其效用均有限制，必須加勞力以變化之，使適合人類慾望上之需要，故生産愈盛則財富愈增，財富愈多則慾望充足之機會亦愈多，人生幸福，因此益得增進焉。惟生産事業，並非國中一特殊階級之工作，必須全國人民共同擔任，或從事於農業工業之生産，或從事於商業之經營，或從事於學問藝術上之研究，分工合作，皆生産也。</p>
<p>吾人日常生活之中，在在均有消耗之行爲，若飲食起居等莫不皆然。旣有消耗，則必設法生産以填補之，設徒知消耗而不事生産，則一且消耗罄盡時，生活卽不能滿足矣。個人對於社會之貢獻如何，當視其生産力之大小而定，自其所生産者减去其所消耗者，所餘之數，卽其人之社會評價也。若生産多而消耗少，其個人價値必高，反之則低，試以公式表明之如後　　個人價値＝生産－消耗</p>
<p>我國現在一般人民，多耽於安逸，鮮事生産，社會上因消耗者多而生産者少，故其結果乃發生不足之現象，抑即國家貧困之根本原因也。亦可以公式表明之如後：</p>
<p>生産（少－淸耗（多）＝不足</p>
<p>生産之重要，旣如上述。至其本身，約可分爲二類：一爲物質的生産，乃有形的，如農業及工業之生産，或變財富之性質，或變財富之形式，俾能創造增加其效用，而抬高其價値；一爲非物質的生産，則由社會全部人民之服務以容成之，人人必須盡其所長，努力爲社會服務，以期本人在社會中成一有用之人材，此種生産雖係無形的，然亦頗重要。</p>
<p>生産之目的，則有個人的及社會的二種：前者爲滿足本人之慾望，如謀個人衣食之温飽，及其事業之發展與成功等是。若不從事生産，則不能獲得社會之報酬，個人慾望無由滿足；後者乃爲人羣謀幸福，較前者尤爲重要，蓋人爲社會的動物，個人不能離羣而獨立，故於一身一家之外，尙應顧及國家之利益，與一般社會之幸福，國家社會因隨人類慾望之進化而日見發達，倘遇個人慾望與社會慾望衝突，兩者難以同時滿足時，卽當犧牲個人慾望，然後社會慾望始得充足，社會之發達乃有圓滿之望焉。</p>
<p>生産之實行，當先具有生産之要素。生産要素者，參加生産以爲其用，而構成生産之結果者也，學者通常皆以資本勞力及土地三者爲生産之要素云。</p>
<p>資本在今日對於生産最爲重要，凡機械之應用及企業之擴張等，均非具有資本莫辦。一切生産之盛衰興亡，皆决於資本之有無多寡，有資本，則任何企業，皆得經營，無資本則任何生産不能從事，資本大者勞而資本小者衰矣。</p>
<p>勞力亦爲生産所不可缺少之原素，因一切天然産物之效用，輒難滿足人類慾望，必須加入勞力以增多其效用，如古人感茹毛飲血穴居野處之不足也，則創爲熟食，作爲宫室，吾人今日衣食住行一切之進步，皆前人努力生産之結果也。</p>
<p>土地乃自然之賜予，具有天然之生産能力，一切動物植物，均賴其仰載滋生，地層之下，更有煤鐡等礦産之藴藏，此非獨爲生産所不可缺少之要素，實國民經濟上不可不備之要件也　　夫資本勞力及土地等對於生産之關係，旣如此重要，吾人誠宜如何撙節使用，俾無缺乏之祺；但國人對於生産要素之浪費，已成習慣。　　以言资本，則我國向稱貧窮，缺乏資本，而稍擁資産之人，每不知如何運用資本，以從事於正當之生産事業。或則喜爲投機之事，或則耽於赌博之好，上焉者亦不過將欵項存之外國銀行而已，坐使利權外溢，資本虚耗，而正當生産事業，反無由獲得资本，致無發展之機會，寗不可傷？</p>
<p>國人對於勞力之使用，亦多浪費，綜觀其原因，或因衛生之設備不週，致影　及於工人健康，而减少工作之能力：或以工人缺乏敎育，知識不足，致常蹈法網，身陷　閻而不能工作；或由於管理方法之不善，或造成工人怠情之機會，甚且流於浪漫，工作成績，自必因之而减低；此外尙有一種危險之現象，卽爲近年以來，我國農村經濟逐漸衰落，而都市新興産業猶未發達，値此過渡時期，工人供過於求，失業者遍地皆是，有勞力者苦無使用之機會，此種損失，對於國民經濟影響頗鉅，足使社會發生動摇。</p>
<p>国或人對於土地之使用，尤屬不經濟之至，荒地不知墾種。耕地不加改良，試觀西北平原，沃野千里，　藏無盡，徒以交通不便，居民稀少，遂任其荒棄，無人墾種；東南各處，向稱農事發達之區，然因地利有限，已耕之地，若不加以改良，生産必無增加之望，且以河道不疏，湖泊淤塞，水患連年，農産太减，於是以農立國之國家，並其日需糧食，亦須仰給於外人矣。</p>
<p>然則吾人果將如何而使現代靑年成爲他日健全之生産者乎？吾人對於各種生産要素，究應持何種態度乎。</p>
<p>凡一健全之生産者，必須具有充足之學識，健强之體格，與善良之道德，苟無充分之學識，則不知如何生産始爲有效；苟無健强之體格，則根本無從事生産之能力；然使學識足矣，體格强矣，但缺乏善良之道德，則其人之學識體力，若用之不得其當，消耗有餘，生産不足，何有於國家耶？此種健全生産者之資格，務須於靑年時代好爲養成，俾他日長成，可多爲社會服務，多爲社會生産也。</p>
<p>再因鑒於過去一切之錯誤，以後對於生産之要素，當持下列態度：</p>
<p>（一）對於資本，應先從節儉下手，以免浪費，當使用資本時，宜特别審愼，先竟此種投資，是否果能生産？是否有益於社會國家？如能生産而有益於社會國家，則雖有犧牲，在所不惜，否則雖毫末之微，亦當珍視之。</p>
<p>（二）對於勞力方面，除勞心之勞働外，更應注意體力之勞働實力夫做，以改正中國重勞心而輕勞力之差誤觀念，蓋勞心勞力，同屬勞働，對於生産，同樣重要，固不容軒輊於其間也。</p>
<p>（三）對於土地，應研究自然界之現象，以便戰勝之，對於自然現象能多了解一分，卽能多利用一分，自然之賜惠無窮，要視吾人能否戰勝之與利用之耳。</p>
<h3>略論生産要素分類法葓耕</h3>
<p>生産要素的分類法，在生産及分配兩方面都佔着很重要的地位，因爲在生（資）産裏他能指示某要素的職能，在分配裏他能决定某要素應得的酬報。所以我們覺得關于他的分類法，該有閘明與討論的必要。</p>
<p>生産要素分類的内容，乃是漸次的充實起來的，並非是一蹴而就，他經過了歷史上若干年的演化，才能達到現在的階段，我們可以從兩方面去觀察他的推進。</p>
<p>第一先從傳統ＴＲＡＤＩＴＩＯＮ方面看來，可以分爲三步驟：</p>
<p>（五）土地重商主義以金銀爲國家之財富，及重農主義起，盡反其說，以土地爲唯一可生産之物，亦唯土地可以少數之成本而獲得大量之凈餘，即所謂ＮＥＴＰＲＯＤＵＣＴ。其他如工，商業等不過只是改變物的形態或地域，並不能有所生産，所以那時候的經濟學者如ＢＯＩＳＧＵＩＬＬＥＢＥＲ　　ＶＡＵＢＡＮＣＡＮＴＩＬＬＯＮ（以上爲重農派之先導）ＭＩＲＡＢＥＡＵＱＥＳＮＡＹ（以上爲重農派之大師）等俱以土地爲唯一的生産要素。</p>
<p>（二）勞力以後到了亞當斯密，却進步了一層認爲一切商品之交換價値皆以其所需之勞動製造量爲估計，所以勞力實在是一國的富源，不過他仍然信任自然（即土地）在生産的過程中日有相當重要的地位，贊助他的理論的有李加多，馬克思諸人。</p>
<p>（三）資本在工業革命以前，保持家庭工藝，生産與消費的關係是處于直接的地位。可是工業革命以後，實行大規模生産，又因工廠制度之成立，必需用大量的機器與宏壯的廠屋，所以在這環境下，資本必然的成爲生産要素之一，到了一八三六年ＳＥＮＩＯＲ乃確定資本在生産中的地位，他的分類法乃是這樣的：</p>
<p>（一）基本的要素</p>
<p>（一）土地</p>
<p>（二）勞力</p>
<p>（二）附屬的要素丨資本</p>
<p>在傳統分類法中的諸要素，俱各受一公律之限制，如土地受報酬漸減律的限制，勞力受人口律的支配。而資本則爲利潤遞减律及忍慾說的支配，關於這些公律的詳細理論，因爲篇幅的關係，不能在這裏詳說。</p>
<p>第二種分類法是以職能爲標準而分的：</p>
<p>（一）工作（working）即勞工對于生産的貢獻，前已論其發展，其所得的報酬爲工資。</p>
<p>（二）等待（ＷＡＩＴＩＮＧ）卽資本家對于生産之貢獻，他能犧牲現在的享樂，以资本加人生産，而待將來之收獲，是卽所謂利息。</p>
<p>（三）管理或冒險（ＭＡＮＡＧＥＭＥＮＴＯＲＲＩＳＫＴＡＫＩＮＧ）這就是指企業家對于生産的貢獻，他能指揮生産的支配與進行，同時他還得要猜度市塲的狀况，以决定生産的種類。這一點即包含了冒險的性質　假如觀察的確實則可以獲得ＰＲＯＦＩＴ，但是萬一事與願爲，即必蒙受損失ＬＯＳＳ這以上將分類法的種類，約略的述了下。分類法到了近世，除以上數點外，並没有什麽增損，我們就拿馬謝爾ＡＭＡＲＳＨＡＬＬ來講，他的分類法可以用下圖來表示：</p>
<p>生産要素（自然……土地資本……資本人類類……勞力）管理或組織綜合起來看，分類法發達到了現在爲止，他的内容爲大家所公認的有土地，資本，勞力，管理四項。時論有以爲國家也要作爲生産要素之一，他的意問　歸納起來，可以得三點：</p>
<p>（一）政治環境對于生産的影響政治家環境就是秩序與治安，假使有了有形的生産要素，而缺乏秩序與治安，則生産不能發達。</p>
<p>（二）社會環境對于生産的影響社會環境即是社會的組織，對於生産也有莫大的關係。</p>
<p>（三）國家的徴之租稅即爲其參加生産事業所應得的報酬。</p>
<p>從以上的理論，我們分析起來：</p>
<p>（一）國家在生産上是否已經有人認爲是生産要素，從歷史上看起來，還没有人直接認爲國家是生産的要素之一。至多也不過承認國家對于生産是有絶大的帮助，缺乏他的時候並不見得卽如缺乏勞工或資本的一樣的會停止生産，只不過是减少他的生産量而已。證之李士特，雷蒙特ＤＡＮＩＥＬＲＡＹＭＯＮＤ諸人之說皆然，卽爲中國今日之狀况秩序安寗不能維持，豈可謂中國全然無生産乎。</p>
<p>（二）國家是否直接影響于生産生産過程中主要的成分爲勞役及物二者，卽以勞役變化物之形態，而國家的効用乃爲消極的　値，卽生産能隨國家政治之改進而發達，並非謂國家能直接影響于生産。關于　一點歷來呈者聚訟紛紜，有一派以爲國家非但不能幫　生産，且足以爲其害，國家完全是一種耗費，亞　斯密卽主張此說。而　伊氏則　和之。另一派以爲國家是生産的，又可别爲數小派。</p>
<p>（甲）生産力說丨爲李士　所主張，卽謂國家雖不能直接産生價値，但是却能　産生一種生産力以輔佐生産。</p>
<p>（乙）資本家的生産說爲ＫＡＲＬＤＩＥＴＺＥＬ所主張，以爲國家以一種無形資本的形態來促進生産，但是國家的無形資本的價値却無法估計　　（丙）再生産力說ＬＶＳＴＥＩＮ氏所倡導。卽是說國家的效能，可以成爲個人的資本而表現，卽是國民經濟上的再生産，但是我們也不能决定這種資本究竟佔個人資本的若干成分，所以也不　用。</p>
<p>（丁）新生産說爲瓦格納等所提倡，謂家國能創造無形財以輔翼生産。</p>
<p>綜記以上諸說各有瑕疵。比較起來　以新生産說爲可信。可是他所論到的國家與生産的關係，仍是處于簡接而非直接的地位。</p>
<p>（三）國家是否爲一純經濟的組織國家的職能乃是紛雜的而非純經濟的，所以他的組織也是適合多方的需要，而生産不過佔其中的一部份，由此可以證明國家並不是一個純經濟如工廠，公司等一樣的組織，同時卽不能成爲一個獨立的生産要素。</p>
<p>（四）國家的功效不易估計生産中各要素的功能都是可以估計的，所以在分配的時候才能决定他們各别應得的報酬。但是國家的功能旣是多方的，我們怎樣估計他在生産上有多少貢獻，要是不能估計，則他的報酬又從何而定，其實這一切事實已明明的告訴我們國家不是個生産要素。至于以爲租稅卽是國家所得生産之報酬，亦殊不盡然，一則因租稅乃强迫徴收性，而其他生産要素則在自由競爭之條件下獲得其報酬。一則因租稅徴收之數額，未必能與其效能相當，再則租稅的用途並非盡爲生産的，亦有及于其他慈善，改進享受等事業的，則又將何以别之。</p>
<p>總之，至現在爲止還止曾有人，並且也不能以國家爲生産要素之一。至于以後怎麽樣，我們現在還不能决定。或者到那時社會制度改變，國家的職能因之而演化，理論或許成爲事實罷。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>有聲電影在靜安寺</h3>
<p>— 惠</p>
<p>「今天是四月初八日，到靜安寺看熱閙去。」</p>
<p>「張媽，快去買香燭，老太太都準備好了。」</p>
<p>「南無阿彌陀佛……南無釋迦牟尼佛……南無觀世音菩薩……」</p>
<p>「……………」</p>
<p>在平日的倒馬桶聲，賣報紙聲，脚踏車的鈴聲，小販的喊賣聲，吱吱喳喳的談話聲吵閙聲外，今天很剌耳的參加了這些聲音，由窗口送進亭子樓上尙擁被而臥的我的耳鼓中來。當時我的尊腦就立刻頒下一道秘令丨「凑熱閙去丨」於是一咕　遛下牀來，在抽斗中，枕頭底下，，箱角落裏摸索了好半天，竟找不出一文錢來，心中很懊悔「昨天兩角錢不該花在麵館裏！」但還自幸有兩條腿。當即開足馬力加速度向這個今天最熱閙的場合駛來丨足足駛了兩個有半的鐘頭！這可說是我自有吃奶的經騐，從没做過的「在陰沉沉的早晨，作長足的旅行」。</p>
<p>「棚，攤，車子，人，呌喊，擁擠，擁擠，還是擁擠！」丨這是寺門前的速寫。</p>
<p>在擁擠中，我究竟不愧是個健者，我很快地擠進寺裏！呀！這裏在映一幕有聲電影：一個宗敎的盛會中，有窮人，富翁；有鄕下的，城裏的：有深閨裏的大小姐，終年不見天日的老太太：有西裝靑年，摩登女士；有大腹便便的孕婦，走路巍顫顫的老頭兒；還有西洋男士，外國水兵……形形色色，看得我昏頭昏腦！我發現他們各人帶着一顆不同的心：有求財的心，求福的心，求壽的心，求免災的心，求愛人的心，求六甲生男的心，有普渡衆生的心，也有包藏禍心的。西洋男士帶着一顆觀光咱們東方精神文明的心：外國水兵帶着一顆做軍閥的心，侵略弱小民族的心！（我的心是虚的，並且不敢稍有邪心的猥褻的心、怕的是佛菩薩威靈顯聖，陡降災禍，害我肚皮疼，那可不是玩的！）那些佛公，佛婆，佛靑年，佛女士，一個　身背黄色布袋，手擎香燭，目不他顧，口中念念有詞，（大概是求佛菩薩神靈賜予他們蕴藏着心的實現吧！）可憐他們起起倒倒，手腿合作而不得停息。我　立一旁靜聲屏氣又足足的看了一百零幾十分鐘，居然在「起起倒倒」中發現了三年不見的老同學根生，跟着他「起倒」的，大概是他的太太（我就心想：他們是來求兒子的。）於是我就立刻扯住他，並且很敏捷地轉了一個雅念（這時可顧不得佛菩薩的威靈了，）向他們敲以了一筆竹槓，要他們請我乘電車。</p>
<p>我們三個擠出寺門，走到赫德路口，在人叢中忽然一個西洋傳敎士遞一本「福音」給我。根生驚訝地說：「這位傳敎士的宣傳功夫很不差，不近不遠，偏偏在靜安寺門口佈道，大概他想以耶蘇基督來抵制我們的釋迦牟尼佛罷。」　回到斗大的亭子樓中，躺在牀上，腿是酸楚楚地，肚裏咕嚕嚕地……</p>
<h3>幸福的人</h3>
<p>— 蘋</p>
<p>一個月前我的朋友從北國歸來，他是被三十元的代價出賣到北國去的。三年前的春天，我患着初期肺病，在一個小醫院中療養；他正這時候像中了香檳一般難的悄悄地到北國去。詐多窮朋友因爲不願意我知道這消息，恐怕我感傷離别之愁，他没有到我醫院中辭别，悄悄地去了，到那荒漠一般的北國，其實這是怎樣可愛的消息，許多朋友中誰有資格自己的身體可以賣三十塊錢一個月。我一方感謝朋友愛我之情，一面好像不能送他榮任認爲遺憾。</p>
<p>這一次，他雖不榮歸故里，仍能帶了較爲蒼老的容貌歸來，仍能像土老兒</p>
<p>文藝</p>

<p>瀋陽奉客錦州陪，更把榆關次第開，自是中華多土地，區區餽贈理應該，</p>
<p>凛凛威風北大營，傷心夜陷瀋陽城，如何攘外先安内，留得千秋不戰名，</p>
<p>河山破碎國阽危，諸將迍　不出師，忍令熱河淪倭寇，砲聲直逼鳳凰池，</p>
<p>一般的歸來，終究三十塊錢没有賣掉他的靈魂。在我自己，窮人是不能生病的，肺病到如何程度是不可而知，但是在一個報館裏做事，我的朋友認爲適合我個性的好職業。所以在春降臨到上海的一個月中，我們到過龍華，像公子哥兒一般的效春游的舉動；我們到過半淞園，在小河中莫明其妙的追逐感人的歌女；在夕陽的餘暉中，我們到過霞飛路散步，心是活躍的，步伐是輕鬆的；在晨曦初上的時候，我們到過黄浦江邉，精神是安閒的，態度是活潑的。一個月很快的過去了，春也不知不覺隨着乳燕的生長而悄悄的逝去，我的朋友又將送到荒漠的北國。</p>
<p>我現在仍是個病人但是不能住小醫院了。因爲自己生性率直，不能夠抓住時代跑，終於擠出了出賣自己身體的人羣。我在最後一天的報上說，我將我這身體作孤注之一擲吧？或者有坐汽車歸來的一天，朋友們，别笑我痴，有許多人夢想着這般做；有許多人已經做了歸來坐汽車！就在這天晚上，我能親自參加送行朋友的酒樓中，丨丨三年前認爲遺憾的事在這樣的環境中實踐！</p>
<p>送行這類事，我還是第一回，雖在極度興奮的飲酒高歌中，多少藴含着感傷的情調。朋友們前次不使我知道，並不是没有理由的，他重回北國，不是仍是可愛的事實。</p>
<p>從北站送行歸來，已是深夜，萬籟無聲，幾個朋友踏着自己的影子默默地走着，大概總有這樣的同情吧，能夠出賣自己身體的還是幸福的人！</p>
<h3>窮話</h3>
<p>— 竹巖</p>
<p>一個人到了窮的時候。處處見的是窮事。講的窮話。作的窮文章。看的窮書報。交的窮朋友。小子最歡迎看的。本刊上各篇的大作。因爲撰登的。大都是窮文章。像亭子間裏的生活。店員通訊。自我介紹職員等的作品。那豈非是窮苦的話嗎？小子想本刊主幹。一定也是一位窮編輯。所以特别歡迎那種窮稿子。盡量的登刊。給我們窮小子一些的生活。</p>
<p>再講到一個人。到了窮的時候。切勿可見着一種窮樣出來。否則你到處被人奚落。被人呌窮光蛋。做窮人。必定要裝着「肚俄腹挺」的樣子。才不拆穿西洋鏡。都市中的人眼。是會像狗般專看不起的窮人啊。</p>
<p>可是小子說倒會說。自己時時振不窮相。有時小子心裏想想。人是窮了。我的人像。切勿有窮的樣子。這樣一想。小子的尊臉。頓時裝着一副樂觀開懷的模樣了。那時不識相的黄臉婆。抱着</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>小囝。來小子面前說道。「小毛拉爺。小毛奶粉吃完了。你跑出的時候。買一聽回來。勿要忘記呢。還有樓下二房東伯伯說。我們房錢。已經過頭十多天。還没有付下去。若再勿付。他們要另貼招租了。再有我的爷爷。後天是五十歲做壽。你預備送些什麽？」這樣一大篇的話。小子聽了。一副樂觀開懷的尊臉。頓時復變了蹙眉縐額的窮相來了。小子一想。奶粉最少的要二隻羊。房錢八隻羊。岳父做壽。最起碼送的是壽桃。壽糕。壽燭。壽香。也要四隻羊不可。一共倒要十四隻老羊。那時小子袋裏。只乘二毛錢。六只銅板。那末窮思極想。將二只破皮箱裏。東掏西翻。整了幾件未破的衣褲。包札定當。挾了出門。到了長生庫裏。那位朝俸先生。見小子是老主顧。終算帮小子的忙。當了九隻羊。否則至多七隻羊可當。小子一想。現在只有九隻羊。還勿夠要用。用只硬着頭皮。跑到家裏。向那二房東老伯伯商量。再欠幾天。幸而這位老伯伯。不知什麽興頭。見了小子。怪可憐的。就得應了緩付幾天。那時小子一想。這個難關。可以過去了。一副尊臉又展開了。當時出去。買了一聽奶粉。定了壽桃壽糕。買了壽燭壽香。還多幾隻羊回來預備吃夜飯了。不想那黄臉婆。又來和小子爲難了。她說「小毛拉爺。後天我到爸爸家裏去祝壽。我的一件旗袍。和一只戒指。你要給我贖出來的。否則我這樣破的衣服。如何可去呢。」小子又聽了這話。不覺木呆了多時。想旗袍當的五元。戒指當的十四元。總共是十九元。這個難關。委實没法想了。只得對她說道「你原諒些吧。現在我實在没有法子了。前樓嫂嫂。她有許多旗袍。長短和你差勿多。可向她借一件穿穿吧」。窮話說到這裏。因火油點燥了。祗得擱起窮筆。下次再來講罷。</p>

<h3>白色的没落</h3>
<p>— 昌炤</p>
<p>在去年初夏的一個黑夜裏，我從外祖家出來。天空中下着微微的雨。四週的空氣非常沉寂，停車處也没有人。祗有一些斷續的骨牌聲從對街的烟紙店中透出。雨愈下愈緊了。細密的雨絲飛掠到面上眞有些使我難受。電車還没有來，我祗得靜靜地看看汤車馳過飛濺的泥水和天上閃爍的星光。</p>
<p>突然找又聽見一些比牙琴的聲韻了，我知道這是這裏隣近落魄的白俄人家透出來的。韻調還不十分純熟，大約是一個新手吧。我正在無意識地領略這異國情調的時候，突然我的背後好像有人在同我講話。我回頭一望，瞧見一位中年的肥胖俄婦在和我做手勢，這可把我奇怪極了。我再不會料到竟有這種事情的，於是我就拿一種好奇的目光去　　她。</p>
<p>她已經是一個中年的婦人了，雖然她塗了滿臉的脂粉和滿嘴的口紅，但是畢竟掩不住她的老大，她已經完全失了靑春的美麗，失去了誘惑的能力；再也鼓引不起人們對於她的情感了。但是她要我些什麽呢？是不是向我要錢呢？她的那一付哀感神情，我知道她要我去帮助她，但是我聽不懂她的話。</p>
<p>ＷＨＡＴＤＯＹＯＵＷＡＮＴ我問她。</p>
<p>「咭喔太……咭喔太」她更可憐了　　可是我依舊不懂她說些什麽，她那硬生生的英吉利話不會使我明白。</p>
<p>ＷＨＡＴＤＯＹＯＵＷＡＮＴＩＳＡＹ我又問她</p>
<p>「咭喔太……咭喔太…得利大拉…司………得利大拉司」她似乎要哭出來了。</p>
<p>啊！這一次可把我明白了，但是阿！你這飄流異國的落泊婦人啊！我慚愧的很呢，請你光顧别人去吧！</p>
<p>ＯＨ　ＯＬＩＣＡＮＴ</p>
<p>她是失望了，她含着眼涙慢慢的在雨絲緊密中消失了。</p>
<p>這裏引起了我的同感，我對於這位可憐的俄婦表示深切的同情。請你們不要小覷她啊！也許她在帝俄時代是一位高貴的婦人呢。又誰知道她不是一個皇族，一位公主，或是一位大公爵的夫人啊！她的面前也許跪過許多年靑高貴的王子，她的頸項間也許懸掛過價値盈萬的珠寳，她呼斥過下人，享受過快樂。但是現在又是怎樣呢？又怎怎樣的在這異國境地的上海，又怎樣在這風雨凄凉的黑夜裏幹這種没落生涯呢！當然，祗要我高興，我那晚不也一樣可以享受像高貴王子們一樣的快樂嗎？又怕她不會把她的好處像供獻給王子們的一樣供獻給我嗎！</p>
<p>但是世界上又那一樁不是這樣呢？我們貴國的貪官污吏啊！你們瞧瞧吧！你們不要太滿足了，又誰知道你們的妻女將來不會和這個無恥的俄婦一樣呢？據</p>
<h3>跳舞塲與小菜塲</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>丨慷慨與吝嗇分野丨</p>
<p>這標題顯然有些牽强，上等文化所在的跳舞塲，竟與卑卑不足道的柴米油鹽醬醋茶的販賣所小菜塲聯在一起，說不定會使讀者「掩鼻而甩之」，更說不定會辱承賜謚曰：「介撒爛污的文丐」！</p>
<p>我便這樣坦白的招供：投靠報屁股摇筆桿過活的人，大抵只有這麽一套。而况衡職度任，本刊也彷彿只須肩負這等小使命。至若「黨國大事」，已多着大人先生們在臺前臺後擂得震天價響，不用咱們僣分嚕囌也。</p>
<p>說來愧　，所謂跳舞，在上海已如家常便飯，而我却還是個十足的門外漢，私幸還曾唸過幾年書，從街頭巷尾，從報端雜誌上，略略獲得些這方面的常識。知道「舞」有「交際雜」「裸體舞」「狐步舞」「古裝舞」「茶舞」等之分，就中以「交際舞」爲最普偏，而其誘惑性最强，爲一般舞癖同胞所稱道不置者，則首推「裸體舞。」「茶舞」之名，始自近今，據說與救國有關，於是乎跳舞塲的使命也就加勝一等了。平時我們只知它是一種營業的組合，而今已是「跳舞救國」甚囂塵上，幾乎與「航空救國」之類相埒，誠不可小覷也。</p>
<p>兜進咱們袋裏的一二隻洋，往往兜上許多日，還是熱烘烘的兜着捨不得用了，聽說出入舞塲裏的同胞，一隻洋僅能沉醉幾分鐘，這還算不了怎樣希奇，最是開起小賬或付點心錢來的時候，才差夠慷慨，大方，比如交付侍者一張五大元的鈔票，本還應找加若干元帶若干角，爲了顯示闊綽，不在乎，往往也就不　　找了，這就　得侍者滿臉春風的迎進送出，呼喚靈應。本來踏進無塲的人，雖不盡是「腰纏百萬，使錢如水」的闊老，也總是在生活上綽有餘裕的分子，錢本是流通的東西，大方幾個，也是該當的。</p>
<p>然而這也就是我所要說的一番意思了。</p>
<p>不說是怎樣闊綽的人，早晨在小菜塲裏，我們總可看到一些晚上出入於跳舞塲的少奶，太太，蜜司，先生，也同樣擠在四五等階級的人叢裏混來撞去，所不同的，是她們大抵帶有跟班！娘姨丫頭之屬，買菜的錢是自己的手捧着，而菜籃當然是屬勞於隨班，睜大着餓鷹似的雙眼，在人叢裏湧鑽，顯然的，此時的色相與沉醉在跳舞塲時，完全兩樣了，簡直有些類似「暴徒」。</p>
<p>看呀，她他們是多麽的刁狠，首先最翻東翻西的審查菜質的好歹，販夫爲了要做筆生意，只好任憑他她們的翻弄，否則不但不買你的了，面且還會使你陣白眼，繼之是一陣價錢的爭嚷，等到價錢講好了，挖了便宜，又少不了要來一陣秤的爭嚷。販夫要過市秤，她他們死會要用自己帶來的十八兩的老秤，你若不從，他會把菜丢下，掉頭不顧了。價錢巧了，秤也足了，本來只用付價就是了，但她他們免不了還要抺下你一二枚銅板的尾子，這樣，販夫也只有光着雙眼吃白虧。最是價尾抹了過後，往往還要額外的撈走一大把菜，販夫着了慌，畧不住要生氣冒火，駡一聲把「猪玀」，但她他們是能容受着的。</p>
<p>這情形在觀光過小菜塲的朋友，想來誰都相信，從這裏的吝嗇，小氣，聯想到在跳舞塲的慷慨，大方，眞不禁使余連聲咄咄曰：「天曉得！天曉得」！</p>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<p>賣關子</p>
<p>編輯先生；</p>
<p>我是本埠某機關裏的練習生，我的服務，是帮辦管卷事務。這管卷一部份，除了我之外，還有一位科員負責。講到管卷事情，實在是很容易的！祗須隨手歸納，不使積滯，不厭煩的將卷目分淸，就没有什麽大不了的了。不料這位科員，他怕我學會之後，搶了他的飯碗，所以大賣其關子。有意將重要案卷，尤其是尙未辦了，每日要調閱的案卷，隨意亂放，檢卷簿與素引也由他自己一人起稿，我呢不過替他抄寫，空下來的時候，還要呌我帮他的忙，改上二三十本考卷，因爲這位科員，還在ＸＸ夜校裏當敎員呀！所以有時他不在這裏的時候，萬一科理要查閱案卷，我就無法檢得：非等他來了之後，是絶對無辦法的。因此上面的職員，都以爲我是飯桶，其實眞寃枉，一個人放的東西，除非有一定的地方，呌那個能夠尋到呢！這樣他就安於其位，還得到一個義務帮手；不過我却苦了，二年半之中，薪水分毫没有加過，至今還拿着十二元一月的津貼。先生，我不是誇張大口，這裏管卷的事情，要是没有他來搗亂，我一個人，包管可以做了，也用不着什麽帮手。但是這一點，上面的職員，那裏肯相信呢？錢子倩謹上</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者按：賣關子的惡習，在中國社會裏是很習見的。人們祗知道他的不是，痛駡採取這種手段的人。其實這種人也很可憐：像上面的那位科員，要是他有保障，說即使這位練習生，學會了管卷事情，他的位置，决没有應響；那没的機關裏，除了少數政務處之外，所有事務員的位置，絶對有保障的，没有重大過我深信他决不會賣關子的：在文明各國後有過失，不能隨意停職。所以他們的一切，無所用其賣關子，各人全部的精力，都專注在工作方面；科學管理，才能實現。</p>

<h3>五姬的一生（三續）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>不過這在她幼弱的心靈中，都是莫明其妙的。據說這家裏的老太婆並不是自己的母親，但是總得要喊「媽媽」，雖然從小兒便是這樣喊慣了的，並不覺得如何不順口，但是假如自己親生的媽媽還在身邊的話，至少是不至於因爲不愛唱戲或其他一點兒小事而遭毒打的吧。然而有一點總還是値得高興的，那就是當着老太婆的面前必须「媽媽媽媽」喊得怪甜密的，但是背着她的時候，却大可仍然以老太婆稱呼她的。屋子裏的姊姊們大家都是如此，於是她也無形中得了這種權利。</p>
<p>其實她不僅是時常受着鴇母的虐待，就　姊妹行裏也是非常姊嫉她的。最大的原因就是她現在居然還有福氣讀書，少不了常時給姊妹們指頭戳在自己的腮上而聽着她咬緊牙齒惡狠狠的駡道：</p>
<p>你長得太好看哪，你大了是老太婆的摇錢樹呀，所以你現在給你唸書去，將來好做一個頂呱呱的婊子好賺大錢呀。」</p>
<p>每次都一樣，給别人的口水噴在臉上自己抹了，因爲自己確是没有胆量回答。</p>
<p>四她哭了</p>
<p>其實，她總覺得有許多事是自己看不慣的。譬如只大自己三歲的金花每天晚上總要換一個人，有的肥得像一隻胖猪，有的連耳朶裏都長着黑毛，簡直怕人。他們是來做什麽的呢？誰都明白，她自己也很明白。可是有時也太令人看不上眼，他們使盡氣力抱着女人親嘴，簡直是打架似的，結果總是女人動顫不得，於是重重的吻着，甚至於還將舌頭伸到她們嘴裏去，口水從嘴角邊流出直往下滴。眞是要命，醜極了。然而還不只這些，當他們灌飽了高梁瘋狂的跑來的時候，馬上抱着她們中間的一個往床上鑽去，房門固然是不必關，就是帳子也來不及放下。這樣的事，常時都有，於是她也很有機會發現他們像狗似躺在那兒，赤裸裸的。</p>
<p>像這樣的事，起初一二次當然會引起她的好奇心，但長久了以後，也就平凡得很，算不了什麽，不過一想到將來自己也會如此，於是便覺得很是可怕。</p>

<h3>好萊塢武俠明星　喬治勃倫脫少年時的冒險性（下）</h3>
<p>— 遜南</p>
<p>有一天喬治勃倫脫又去拜訪那位敎士。剛巧那時候的獨立黨領袖高林上正在物色一位得力可靠的人，去送一封密報到貝爾番斯德。這位高林士，兩次被英國警察所捕，他都設法逃去，現在英國當局已經懸賞緝拿他，所以他晝伏夜出，行動極爲詭秘。那敎士是高林士的密友，他和喬治勃倫脫談到這件事，喬治就感覺到極度的興趣。他要求着要去試一試。這時英國有幾十萬的軍隊，在愛爾蘭全境，維持着外表平靜的秩序；愛爾蘭人的一舉一動，都有人跟隨著；殺戮之慘，可云暗無天日。喬治勃倫脫的祖國，雖是愛爾蘭，但他已在美國多年，得了美國的國籍；並且他一口美國土音無論到什麽地方，人家總當他係一位美國遊歷家，而將他輕輕放過了。這是再好没有的秘密工作人了。</p>
<p>於是喬治勃倫脫就帶了秘密文件，從杜柏杯到了目爾番斯德。那大信封裏的什麽東西，他亦不知道。他的任務就是將那文件帶到貝爾番斯德，交給一個預約好的人，此外他一無所知。</p>
<p>從此之後喬治屢次帶了秘密文件，來往於杜柏林貝爾番斯德之間。他亦不知什麽怕懼。他常常乘了英國的兵車，和英國兵士同起同坐。那時的喬治勃倫脫，亦並不是什麽冒險，實在是他年紀太輕了，不知怕懼是什麽東西。他到了貝爾番斯德，還隨了一大羣人，跳到刑塲上，看那一排的愛爾蘭奸細的槍斃。他亦毫不想想，或者自己有一天亦會站立在他們一起被槍斃的。</p>
<p>至於喬治那時的費用從那裏來的呢？說來亦很有趣。他第一次將那秘密文件帶到貝爾番斯德獨立黨秘密機關的時候，就有人問他要錢化不要？喬治點點頭，那人就拿一大捲的鈔票，塞在他衣服口袋裏。所以他的薪水是没有限制的，祇要開口，從來不少的。從此之後，他來往各地，都裝作美國富家子弟來愛爾蘭，一半遊歷一半求學。他說他那時候，非常自由快活，而惟一的缺憾，就是上峯的嚴禁他和人爭鬥。</p>
<p>在這一年餘之中，亦並不是毫無危險的。有的時候，旅館主人，待他太關切了，他恐怕出毛病，就設法避開了。有的時候，人家注意他的行動了。他就設法逃走了。有一天，危險得很，他那天身上帶了秘密文件從杜柏林到了貝爾番斯德，因爲時間尙早，他就在馬路上閒逛著。等到他回到客棧，客棧主人告訴他，他的行李都搜查過了。危險的很，幸虧他秘密文件他帶在身上。但恐怕英國警察再來！他就設法遷往别處了了。（完）</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>看了道德寳鑑以後</h3>
<p>— 契予</p>
<p>一九三三年的電影界，是經了一次極大的轉變的。從封建餘毒中奮鬥出來，到一個新的壁壘的過程。在這過程中，需要我們不斷的努力，和奮鬥，才能得着豐滿的收穫。</p>
<p>明星新片「道德寳鑑」，丨原名人道之賊，是不是在這一重要的過程擔負了牠的使命呢？我首先肯定的說：道德寳鑑的意識是不健康的。本片的動機是想暴露一些僞君子的眞面目。把人道的内幕揭穿出來，顯示給人們認識；所以把莊大道來代表這一羣蟊賊。可是因爲過重就輕的關係，結果變了缺乏剌激性的報應錄。這因果相循，還是由於巧合而成的。像莊大道巧事南來，莊志卿凑巧留條在寄宿舍，而志卿大宴賓客又適在金仲虎所經理的旅館，都是在空想下構成的。</p>
<p>第二，　對觀衆有什麽指示呢？有的！回鄕村中去，鄕村至少是比城市淸凈些。但，編劇者忘記了帝國主義的經濟勢力侵入了農村，農村是走向　産的途徑；同時，都市的罪惡，也迅速地流瀉到農村中去了。農村是否樂土，這是一個疑問。退一步說：鄕村可以給我們回去的，而這種逃避現實的消極辦法，也决不是我們應取的方針，我們在城市中逃避到鄕村中去；倘使鄕村也不是乾凈土的時候，我們又向那裏走呢？</p>
<h3>觀「孤軍」以後</h3>
<p>— 史美政</p>
<p>以「楊柳靑」因拍戲誤斃，而博得特大宣傳的「孤軍」影片，已經在北京大戲院公映了！這無庸諱言的，我們在未觀這部片子以前，心中想：以爲這部影片如何的偉大而犧牲：而且還有國府要人的題字褒奬更；是使人們深信偉大而無疑了。不佞也久久欲觀　片，因此便於五日下午，驅車前往北京，去看這一部以性命換來的鐡血愛國的「孤軍」。</p>
<p>可是失望得很，當我在映畢出院的時候，歸途上這門地想：這片子的故事，都是太使人失望了！簡直是不知所云。這裏，不佞並不是有意謗毁大中公司，凡是看過這部片子的諸君，都不否認的吧！</p>
<p>開塲的幾幕，是在一所深山叢林之中，有許多兵士在進行着，盲目地拍了　多無謂的片子。後來，兵士不見了，接着便是十來個的騎兵，東西胡亂地奔馳；說是在作戰吧！亦可說是在賽跑。這一幕，又盲目地拍了許多尺的片子。</p>
<p>這片子，不合情理的地方，眞是多得很。　舉一則吧：某一節内，所謂「敵軍」？的長官，打聽得所謂有一隊「孤軍」？來抄後路了！那長官因爲來不及調兵應對，便暗下遣一個女間牒，在中途施計，謀阻止這一隊「孤軍」的前進。一會兒，那一隊騎馬的孤軍，果然來了，也不探聽明白敵踪，貿然的借宿在一　從不相識的女子（即是女間牒）家中。那妇子還裸露了玉體，向孤軍的隊長，引誘獻媚；而隊長似有意非有意地，一些也不懷疑這個女子的奇突；雖然並没有被她所引動。</p>
<p>到了第二日，那隊長發覺了那女子用電話打給敵方；這時候，應該要立刻　了！但，不，事實却與理想相反着；那隊長非但不把那個女子加以捕捉或盤問，而且還毫無懷疑地去了！</p>
<p>再談談關於要人的題字，這好似喪事人家訃文上所印的題贊；這實在是毫無意義的事。</p>
<p>倒底是小製片公司，資本究還不充實，人才當然也缺乏；這一次的失敗，我們應當要加以諒解，並且望大中公司的當局，此後不斷的奮鬭！努力！</p>
<h3>爲「孤軍」可惜</h3>
<p>— 五虹</p>
<p>在這山河色變，家國淪亡的國難聲中，我們日常耳目所接觸的，除了不抵抗軍隊的退却外，就要算塞外「孤軍」的喋血却敵了，所	以當我們聽到「孤軍」二字，就可隱隱想到邊陲絶域，血洒秋風的一幕悲壯戰史，這是多樣令人動心的一個命名啊</p>
<p>不過當我們看見銀幕上的「孤軍」後，不禁使我們失望了，因爲在這片裏僅僅能告訴我們一段事實的演進，並没有將敵人的慘暴，整個的暴露出來，也並未將這隊援絶彈盡的「孤軍」，所受的壓迫及其所抱堅卓不拔的大無畏精神告訴我們，所以殊無動人之可言，</p>
<p>本來戰事片没有偉大的經濟爲後盾，是不易討好的。不過在導演者若明白此種困難，儘可以「表情」爲主系，而以「戰事」爲陪景，這是藏拙的第一要策，况欲表現一種「報國」的精神，也不决不是一味的混戰所能達得到的，若從表情方面進展，或許能月更深切的收獲，但本片導演並不出此，竟置演員的表情於不顧，專從砲火中求進取，於是弱點盡行暴露，而使全劇散漫到無宗旨無意義的地步。</p>
<p>最後我覺得現在我們是需要這一類的愛國戰事片，孤軍雖不能使我們完全滿意，但我總望電影界能有繼起奮鬥者，來喚醒埀死國魂，振起民族精神，這也是戰影界所共負的一點責任啊！</p>
<h3>「孤軍」觀後感</h3>
<p>— 占鼎</p>
<p>炫於報紙上巨幅的廣告，又震於爲藝術而犧牲的楊柳靑之名，我心中藴存好久，而思一觀的「孤軍」，竟花了兩個鐘頭可貴的光陰，在銀幕上看到了。</p>
<p>當着電燈黑暗，銀幕明亮的時候；我也提起了精神，從頭到尾，領略一遍。其中許多不妥的地方，眞是不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>但說本片一些價値也没有嗎？那又不是。在我國電影事業纔萌芽的當兒，固然不免有過事只噓的地方，况本片又是以鬥爭，愛國爲前提的呢。倘若與「西線無戰事」等舶來品比較，自是小巫見大巫。但是在現時的中國，尤其是「國家興亡，匹夫有責」的時候，這種充滿着鐡血和忠義精神的片子，更是我們所需要的。</p>
<p>末了，我希望許多影片公司，更加努力。因爲現在我們所需求的，是鐡和血。不是那些迷醉人生的大腿，女人，酒……</p>
<p>再本片中配和着悲壯的音樂，實給全片以偉大的力量，活躍的生機。</p>
<h3>好萊塢的音樂名手</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>在好萊塢幾千萬的影界人物中，音樂家是不可少的。但是在許多音樂家中，没有一個比得上華納兄弟公司的狄克鮑威ＤＩＣＫＰＯＷＥＬＬ的。</p>
<p>狄克鮑威兄弟三人，狄克最小。他的父親是美國的製譜專家。他兄弟三人，都受了他父親的熏淘，而自小即浸沈於管絃之中。狄克鮑威的長兄，襲了他父親在音樂界中的地位，繼續在美國襲樂譜。狄克的次兄也靠了他父親的聲名，在紐約音樂研究院中任事。而兄弟三人，狄克的技藝最精，所以他能單獨靠奏藝生活。</p>
<p>狄克鮑威未到好萊塢之前，在百老匯畢茨堡等各音樂會奏藝，此外著名的洛賽琪舞台也有他的踪跡。不論提琴鋼琴簫笛喇叭等樂器，他都能奏，而尤以梵亞琳鋼琴最精。他初到好萊塢，是洛賽大戲院請他去的。他在紐約和畢茨堡所得的薪金，每星期有五千多塊美金，所以他没有想入影界的意思。而華納兄弟公司考察他有演影劇的才能，所以執意要聘他。但是狄克不願放棄他家傳的技藝，他雖然答應了，但是他聲明，祇能當影業是一種副業，一年之中祇有十二星期能拍影戲，當然，華納公司知道他的地位，不能勉强的。</p>
<p>狄克鮑威在紐約奏藝，座無虚位，他的技藝，的確是夠醉人的。但很可惜的，他的嗓子有點缺點，不能唱過高的音，所以一位天然的音樂家，祗能奏而不能唱，這是許多的人對於他所抱的遺憾。</p>
<h3>電影小說秘密（ＳＥＣＲＥＴＳ）（二）</h3>
<p>— 羅</p>
<p>但是「天有不測風雲，人有旦夕禍福。」曼麗和蘇笙等認爲很秘密的，極安全的行動，居然有一天被猜疑暴厲的威廉麥羅所發覺了。他親手將那封信拆了開來，看了信上寫的是。親愛的約翰：今天是一個紀念日。你我相識到現在，合算起來。</p>
<p>是十四天七個鐘點。今天晚上因爲家中開宴會，請赫雷爵主，</p>
<p>不能和你相會。但明天一定。我愛你！我愛！我愛你！曼麗</p>
<p>下面還有一大串的愛克斯符號。威廉看了，暴躁如雷。他將約翰卡頓喚了來，問著；「這是不是我女兒親筆寫的信？」約翰說「是的。」威廉又問，「你是不是這信裏所稱的……」他有些說不下去了。約翰接著對他說道；「親愛的約翰？是的，我就是。」</p>
<p>威廉聽了，眼中生火破口大駡起來：「你這個混蛋！你這個下賤無恥的混蛋！」約翰抗聲道：「我不是混蛋，我是極淸醒而敬畏上帝的人。不過我愛你的女兒，我願意娶她。」</p>
<p>「自然一個富家的女兒，你不設法勾引還勾引誰？你給我拿了你的東西，滚你的蛋！我不用你了！」</p>
<p>「謹遵台命，」约翰心平氣靜地對待那暴躁如雷的威廉麥羅說，「但是我未走之先，還要請你給我一封信，證明我的淸廉才幹。」</p>
<p>「胡說！我還要寫信證明你的淸廉才幹？」</p>
<p>「你别作夢了！我自然會替你設法，在新英格蘭尋不著事情做的。」威廉說完了。伏在桌上寫了一張支票，約翰兩星期的薪水，遞給約翰道：「這是你的薪水，傘了滚你的蛋！」</p>
<p>約翰接了支票。慢慢地將支票撕成小片，故意望他僱主的檯上一擲。威廉表示驚奇似的，想世上那有看見錢不要的。忽然他又大怒嚇道；「你這個混蛋，你活在世上一天，你要懊悔一天的！」</p>
<p>成廉拍著桌子大駡的時候，約翰卡頓悄然地向他鞠著躬，退出去了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Red Swastika Society's Second Relief Team Sends Off President Xiong Xiling for Inspection in Stone</h3>
<p>I</p>
<p>Min Customs Superintendent</p>
<p>Jiang Pingfan Assassinated</p>
<p>The Deceased Was the Nephew of National Government Chairman Lin Sen</p>
<p>Assassinated Out of Revenge After Winning a Lawsuit Over a Cemetery</p>
<p>The Assailant, Huang Sandi, Was Arrested on the Spot After the Attack</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, a major assassination case that shocked the entire city occurred in Min. The victim was Jiang Pingfan, the nephew of National Government Chairman Lin Sen. Jiang had served as Superintendent of the Guangdong Chao-Mei Customs, Director of the Fujian Stamp Tax Bureau, and a member of the Fujian Provincial Government and Director of the Construction Department. He was currently the Min Customs Superintendent. The assailant was Huang Sandi, a standing committee member of the Taiwan Overseas Chinese Association. The motive for the attack was a dispute over a cemetery, leading to revenge. The assailant was arrested on the spot. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiang Pingfan held important positions and amassed a considerable fortune. He was particularly criticized for a corruption case during his tenure as Director of the Construction Department, involving the reconstruction of the Wan Shou Jiang Nan two bridges in Fuzhou. In 1931, after leaving his position as Director of the Construction Department, he purchased a garden villa on the Cangqian Mountain bank of the Taijiang South bank, named Tao Garden, and moved in. In 1932, he purchased a burial ground at Jinshi Mountain in Zhuyu Township outside the East Gate to build tombs for his parents and wife. The area was quite extensive, and he compensated the owners of nearby civilian graves to have them relocated. The ancestral tomb of the assailant, Huang Sandi, was also among those to be relocated. Huang refused to move it and sued Jiang in court, but lost the case and was ordered to relocate the tomb. Unexpectedly, after the relocation, Huang's sons and nephews died one after another within a year. He also spent several thousand yuan in litigation fees, and his Western clothing store in Taiwan went bankrupt. Destitute and alone, Huang harbored a deep hatred for Jiang and plotted revenge. He recently learned that Jiang often went to Jinshi Mountain to inspect the tomb construction, so he disguised himself as a grass-cutting farmer, carrying a sickle and a sharp knife, and lurked in the Zhuyu Township area. At 1:00 PM on the 3rd, Jiang indeed went there by car. Upon reaching the entrance of Zhuyu Township, he got out of the car and walked uphill because the road was rough. Just halfway there, Huang Sandi came face to face with him, pulled out a sharp knife, and stabbed Jiang violently in the face. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Jiang quickly jumped into a rice field beside the road. Huang also jumped down, grabbed Jiang, and stabbed him more than ten times in vital areas such as the forehead, throat, top of the head, and chest. Blood splattered everywhere, and Jiang died instantly from his injuries. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, Huang ran away madly. The villagers, having heard the news, gathered and chased after him. Coincidentally, Guan Xiqin, the patrol chief of the county public security bureau, was leading police officers to the countryside to handle a case. They intercepted Huang, who, seeing that he could not escape, surrendered calmly. Patrol Chief Guan escorted him to the county public security bureau in the city. The assailant's attitude was normal along the way, without any change in expression. After arriving at the bureau, Director Luo Yati interrogated him. Huang confessed to the crime without hesitation. A cloth bag was found on his person. When asked about it, he said that he intended to cut off Jiang's head, store it in the bag, and hang it on Fangshou Bridge. He also said that his great revenge had been avenged and he had no regrets about dying. Director Luo temporarily detained Huang and notified Jiang's family by telephone. His concubine and son rushed to Zhuyu to see the body and wept bitterly. They reported the matter to the local court and requested them to send personnel for an autopsy. At 10:00 PM, Prosecutor Xu Guanlan arrived for the autopsy. The family moved the body home and scheduled the coffin for the afternoon of the 4th. The assailant was escorted by the county public security bureau to the local court on the morning of the 4th for interrogation and processing. (May 4th)</p>
<p>Sichuanese</p>
<p>Oppose Japanese Warships Coming to Chongqing</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Intended to Suppress the Boycott of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Chongqing Citizens Decide on Countermeasures</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: Sichuan Province has always been a dumping ground for Japanese goods. Even in remote rural areas, Japanese goods are ubiquitous. However, since the September 18th Incident, public sentiment in Sichuan Province has been quite aroused, and people have collectively implemented an economic boycott of Japan. Various national salvation associations and economic boycott committees have been established to inspect imported goods. Any goods found to be Japanese are confiscated and burned. Even those suspected of being Japanese goods are severely punished. Even when Japanese goods are delivered via postal parcels, they are discovered and confiscated. The Chongqing Sichuan All-Circles People's National Salvation Congress had a major dispute with the Dongchuan Postal Administration because of this. As a result, no fewer than 500 bags of postal parcels were set on fire and destroyed by Chongqing citizens. With Japanese goods unable to be dumped in Sichuan Province, Japanese merchants asked the Japanese Consul-General to find a way to stop this. The Japanese Consul-General believed that Chongqing was the gateway to Sichuan Province, and that all goods were transshipped through the area. If they could pass through Chongqing Customs, there would be no problem in the interior. Therefore, he telegraphed the Japanese Consul in Hankou, ordering the warships "Settsu" and "Katata," which were stationed in Hankou, to sail to Chongqing to suppress anti-Japanese sentiment. Upon receiving the telegram, the Japanese Consul in Hankou immediately informed the captains of the two warships. On April 30th, the warships sailed upstream from Hankou. However, after arriving in Yichang, they found that the Sichuan River had many shoals and dangerous waters, and that only Sichuan River pilots such as Jiang and Guada Ma could navigate it. The Japanese Consul in Yichang sent Chinese traitors to Chongqing to hire Sichuan River pilots with high pay so that the Japanese warships could reach Chongqing. Several traitors were hired and sent to Yichang to act as pilots. On May 2nd, the Japanese warships, which were docked in Yichang, fired up their engines and sailed upstream again. They were expected to reach Wanxian on the 5th and Chongqing on the 7th. Liu Xiang was deeply concerned that the warships' arrival would cause misunderstandings among people and lead to incidents. He telegraphed the Japanese Consul in Hankou, asking him to immediately stop the warships from sailing upstream. At the same time, people from all walks of life telegraphed the Japanese Consul in Yichang, asking him to immediately stop the two warships from entering Sichuan. The telegrams stated that since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese Consul-General in Chongqing had been recalled to Japan, and all Japanese residents in Chongqing had left. Business had also been cut off. There was no need for Japanese warships to come to Chongqing. Otherwise, it would be a pretext for provocation and causing disputes. All the people of Chongqing were willing to shed their blood, and the responsibility would be borne by Japan. After the telegrams were sent, the Japanese warships continued to sail upstream regardless of everything, attempting to use gunboats to suppress our determination to boycott Japanese goods. The Chongqing citizens held several meetings to discuss the attitude and countermeasures to be taken regarding the Japanese warships' arrival in Chongqing. Two decisions were made: (1) Take active measures to deal with the situation by laying mines and various obstacles to shipping in the river from Tangjiatuo, 15 li from Chongqing, to the lower reaches of the river. All Chinese and foreign merchant ships were notified to temporarily suspend navigation to prevent Japanese warships from sailing upstream. (2) Passively resist the warships by not supplying them with food or fuel, and persuading the Chinese on board to sever their relationship with them. Otherwise, coercive measures would be taken. The people of Chongqing are currently preparing for the above measures. (May 4th)</p>
<p>Beijing-Shanghai Railway</p>
<p>Plans to Implement Joint Water-Land Transportation in Jiangbei</p>
<p>Personnel Sent to Zhenjiang to Discuss Arrangements with Various Shipping Companies</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Zhenjiang station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has always been a hub for the transfer of passengers and goods to the Jiangbei region along the canal. Business is extremely prosperous. However, since the Zhenjiang river surface was blocked by the Taijiang shoals, the number of ships arriving and departing decreased, and the passenger and freight volume greatly declined. Moreover, since the opening of direct Shanghai riverboats in the Huojiaqiao area of Jiangdu County in Jiangbei, passengers and goods from Jiangbei have been entering and exiting through that point. This avoids the danger of crossing the river, and the ticket prices are cheaper than train tickets. Furthermore, goods do not have to pass through Zhenjiang, thus avoiding customs duties. As a result, Huojiaqiao has become a tax-free free port in Jiangbei. Initially, the Dada Company was the only company operating Yangtze River services. More recently, the Datong Company has also started operating services, seemingly seizing Zhenjiang's position and replacing it. As a result, not a single small shipping company in Zhenjiang has avoided bankruptcy, and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway's passenger and freight transportation has also been severely affected. Previously, passenger transportation could generate more than 3,000 yuan per day, but now it is less than 2,000 yuan. Unless reforms are made, the situation will continue to deteriorate. It is reported that the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau recently sent Zeng Zhihong, the stationmaster of Zhenjiang station, Lu Bohua, the freight inspector of the western section, and Xu Bingcheng, the section chief of the vehicle department stationed in Nanjing, to negotiate joint transportation arrangements with various small shipping companies and the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Automobile Company. In the future, passengers and goods from Yangzhou, Qingjiang, Taizhou, and other counties in Jiangbei traveling to various ports in Beijing and Shanghai can purchase tickets and load goods at their respective starting points and pick up their luggage and goods at their destinations. Transportation costs will be lower and more convenient, with the aim of developing shipping and rail transportation. (May 7th)</p>

<p>Shandong Silk Merchants Request Relief</p>
<p>Zhoucun Silk Merchants Request Issuance of Relief Vouchers</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong Province's silk industry has declined drastically in recent years. Japanese merchants have taken the opportunity to invade and encroach, pushing it to the brink. Not only have 90% of the silk factories closed down, but also the number of silkworm breeders in rural areas has been decreasing year by year. If this continues, Shandong Province's silk industry will be in danger of complete bankruptcy. Silk merchants in Linqu County received assistance from the provincial government last year and issued relief vouchers to maintain their business. Silk merchants in Zhoucun have also requested the issuance of Zhoucun vouchers worth 200,000 yuan, citing the Linqu example. According to Li Huafeng, chairman of the Zhoucun Chamber of Commerce, the situation in the silk industry is as follows: Before 1929, the Zhoucun area produced more than 1 million jin of fresh cocoons annually. Suzuki, a Japanese merchant, purchased 30-40% of the cocoons, while domestic silk factories such as Tongfeng, Hengxingde, Xinjie, and Yuanfeng purchased 70-80%. Due to the labor unrest in 1929, the stagnation of silk sales, and the competitive sale of Japanese silk, the Zhoucun silk factories were unable to sustain themselves and were all shut down in 1931. Last year, cocoon production was only 300,000 jin, less than one-third of previous years. The entire amount was purchased by Japanese merchants at low prices, which severely impacted the silkworm breeders in the countryside. Some villagers, out of anger, even cut down mulberry trees that had been cultivated for many years. This spring, the rain has been timely and the mulberry leaves are lush, so cocoon production is expected to be abundant. The Zhoucun silk merchants have requested the Chamber of Commerce to submit a report to the Changshan County government and the Department of Industry, citing the Linqu case of issuing silk industry relief vouchers (Linqu issued 900,000 last year, and after retrieving them, issued 400,000 yuan again this year) and request the issuance of Zhoucun vouchers worth 200,000 yuan for a period of four months, with a monthly interest rate of 6%. The silk factories will use their factory sites as collateral, jointly establish a cocoon purchasing office, and rent silk factories to reel silk and sell it, then redeem the relief vouchers to maintain the silk industry's lifeline and prevent it from being monopolized by Japanese merchants. If the industry can be maintained this year, the number of silkworm breeders will increase next year, and Shandong Province's silk industry will still have hope of recovery. The various reports will be submitted soon. The detailed measures for issuing relief vouchers and the combination of cocoon purchasing and silk reeling are being studied by the Chamber of Commerce and the silk factories. It is estimated that this year's cocoon production will be 600,000 jin, half of which will be purchased by Japanese merchants. If domestic silk factories purchase half with relief vouchers, that would be 300,000 jin. Based on a price of about 300 yuan per 100 jin, relief vouchers worth 100,000 yuan would be sufficient. However, this also depends on the amount of cocoon production. (May 3rd)</p>

<p>Investigation of the Illegal Sale of Ancient Tombs</p>
<p>Near Tong'an Bridge in the Suzhou Countryside, There is an Ancient Tomb Belonging to the Ye Family, Occupying Over 28 Mu of Land and Containing More Than 100 Tomb Buildings. The Tomb Owner Has Been Serving in the Political Circles of Shaanxi Province and Has Not Visited the Tomb for More Than 30 Years. Recently, Hou Mingjiu Illegally Sold the Tomb, Selling All the Bricks, Tiles, and Stone Materials to a Mr. Chen for 13,000 Yuan. Fearing Obstruction from the Villagers During the Demolition, Eight Armed Men Were Assigned to Guard the Site. Fang A'er, the Tomb Keeper, Reported the Incident to the County Government in the City and Requested Assistance from the Tomb Protection Association. In Addition to the County Government Ordering an Investigation by the District, the Tomb Protection Association Has Also Sent Personnel to Conduct an On-Site Investigation to Ensure Impartial Handling.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Preventing Traitors from Spreading Counter-Propaganda</p>
<p>According to a Secret Report Received by the Local Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, There Are Traitors in the Tea Houses and Restaurants Inside and Outside the City Who Are Spreading Counter-Propaganda to the Elderly, Telling Them That "The Three Provinces of Manchuria Revered the Teachings of Confucius and Mencius, So Their Customs Were Very Honest and Kind." They Tell Merchants That "The Puppet State Has No Taxes, and the Burden on Shops is Very Light." To the Youth, They "Attack the Government as Much as Possible, Hoping to Tempt Their Will." Their Purpose Is to Divide the People in Our Rear Areas, Undermine Their Faith in Our Government, Numb Public Opinion, and Greatly Affect the Overall Anti-Japanese Plan. The 25th Committee Meeting Has Decided to Report the Situation to the County Executive Committee, Which Will Forward the Report to the Provincial Party Headquarters, Instructing All Counties to Pay Close Attention to Prevent Any Trouble from Arising in Advance, to Prevent the People in the Rear Areas from Being Deceived. The County Executive Committee Has Also Sent Notices to the Party Headquarters of Various Counties to Investigate and Deal with the Matter to Eliminate Hidden Dangers.</p>
<p>The Timing of the Spring Silkworm Season Varies Greatly in the Four Rural Areas</p>
<p>In Recent Days, the Weather Has Been Warm, and the Period for the Spring Silkworms to Emerge Has Passed in the Four Rural Areas. The Earliest Silkworms Have Already Had Their Third Sleep, While the Later Silkworms Have Just Begun to Eat Leaves After Their First Sleep. The Latest Silkworms Have Just Been Picked Up from the Ant Bed, or Are Still Being Purchased. There Is a Great Difference in the Timing of This Year's Silkworm Season. The Silkworms Are Currently in Good Condition, and There Is No Market for Mulberry Leaves. The Price of Mulberry Leaves Will Only Fluctuate When the Later Silkworms Have Their Third Sleep. It Is Also Reported That Some Silkworm Eggs Are About to Hatch, but There Are No Customers at All. The Eggs Are Being Stored in Cold Storage and Sold Again. The Quality of the Silkworm Eggs Is Severely Damaged, and Buyers Are Harmed Without Knowing It. Such Merchants Who Harm the People Should Be Severely Punished.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Spring Dredging of the Canal Is Difficult to Implement</p>
<p>The Canal Is Key for North-South Shipping in China and Irrigation in the Entire Jiangbei Region. During the Qing Dynasty, the National Treasury Allocated Funds Annually and Dispatched Senior Officials to Specially Manage Canal Projects. After the Establishment of the Republic, the Management of the Canal Has Been Declining Day by Day. Subsequently, a "Canal Management Acreage Tax" Was Introduced (Limited to Counties Along the Canal) Specifically for Canal Management. The Original Plan Estimated That More Than 600,000 Yuan Could Be Obtained Annually, but the Amount Actually Collected and Submitted Has Never Exceeded 310,000 Yuan, and the Lowest Amount Was Only 80,000 Yuan. As a Result, the Acreage Tax Was Insufficient for Canal Management. The Reporter Recently Met with an Official of the Canal Project Bureau and Inquired About This Year's Spring Dredging Project. He Learned That There Were No Funds to Start Work. The Amount Required Was Only 80,000 to 90,000 Yuan, but the Government Had No Funds to Meet the Need. Before the Separation of National and Provincial Treasuries, Jiangsu's Canal Management Funds Could Still Be Used from National Funds. Now, the Taxes That Should Be Collected by the National Treasury in Jiangsu Are Collected by the Central Government Itself, and Jiangsu Province Cannot Share Any of the Revenue. If the Acreage Tax Revenue Averaged 300,000 Yuan Annually, Then the Canal Project Bureau's Expenses and Temporary Fees for Spring Dredging and Summer Flood Prevention Could Be Covered, but in China, Whenever a Tax Is Levied, the Budget Is One Thing, the Actual Revenue Is Another, and the Actual Submission Is Yet Another. It Cannot Be Used to Offset the Costs and Only Increases the Burden on the People, Which Is Lamentable. It Is Reported That the Provincial Government Contacted the Central Government Regarding This Matter, Requesting the Allocation of Funds, but There Were No Funds to Allocate. It Requested That the Amount Owed to Jiangsu by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications Before the Separation of National and Provincial Funds Be Used to Supplement the Funds, but This Could Not Be Agreed Upon. The Acreage Tax Has Already Been Used and Cannot Be Moved. The Spring Dredging Period Has Passed, and Summer Flood Prevention Is Approaching. If There Is Excessive Rain, Could the Disaster of the Flood Two Years Ago Be Seen Again? It Is Reported That the Authorities Plan to Follow the Example of the Pond Project and Issue Lottery Tickets to Raise Funds for Spring Dredging. However, the Time Is Running Out and There Is No Room for Delay. It Is Hoped That the Provincial Government Will Quickly Devise Practical Measures.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<p>Soviet Russia to Sell the China Eastern Railway</p>
<p>Wu Chaoshu Issues Important Statement</p>
<p>It Is Regrettable That This Matter Should Arise So Soon After the Reestablishment of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Russia</p>
<p>Moscow Telegram: Regarding the proposal by Soviet Russia to sell the China Eastern Railway in order to resolve the dispute over the railway, which is quite relevant to our country, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed Dr. Wu Chaoshu, a member of the Central Executive Committee, to inquire about his opinion. Wu said that China and Russia were in the process of reestablishing diplomatic relations, exchanging ambassadors, and so soon after, the Russian side suddenly took this action, which he deeply regretted. He also said that this proposal clearly violated the original railway contract and would not be in the best interests of Soviet Russia in the future. His statements are recorded below:</p>
<p>Violation of Contract</p>
<p>Wu said in response to the reporter's question that he had seen the Soviet Russian proposal to sell the China Eastern Railway in the newspapers, but that this matter was absolutely something that Soviet Russia should not do, because it violated the original railway contract. The railway belonged to China and Russia and could not be transferred to a third party. He continued that if the Russian side sold the China Eastern Railway and recognized that the three northeastern provinces were still part of China's territory, then the sale should be discussed with the Chinese government, not with the local authorities. If it recognized that the Northeast had separated from China and sold it to the puppet state, then it would be violating the contract, because the puppet state was a third party. Moreover, in fact, the puppet state was Japan, so this action was illegal, and there was no need to say more.</p>
<p>Deep Regret</p>
<p>He continued that in his personal opinion, the central government should express its opinion on this matter and make a solemn statement. The Soviet Russia's action happened just as the two countries had recently reestablished diplomatic relations, and our country's ambassador to Russia and the Soviet Russian ambassador to China had arrived and presented their credentials. This was regrettable. The Russian side probably proposed this out of necessity to avoid current difficulties, but even if the sale became a reality, it would only be a temporary solution. Future disputes would only increase, and it would not be in the best interests of Soviet Russia in the long run. Fortunately, this matter was still in the works, and he could only hope that the Russian side would think carefully and make a prudent decision.</p>
<p>Economic Conference</p>
<p>Regarding the World Economic Conference to be held in England, Wu observed that Japan's militarism and invasion of the Northeast, although related to solving the world's economic problems, would certainly be avoided by the conference. It was impossible for us to solve the Northeast problem with an international conference. He had said it many times that it was better to save ourselves than to hope that others would save us. Others could only help us by saying a few fair words. The fall of the Northeast could not be recovered with a few fair words. What we could rely on was still our own strength.</p>
<p>Denial of the Puppet State</p>
<p>Regarding the draft of the League of Nations subcommittee's non-recognition of the puppet state, Wu also made some comments, saying that the League of Nations could only achieve the "non-recognition" of the puppet state and could not achieve the restoration of the four provinces. If we wanted to achieve the goal of restoration, we still had to do it ourselves.</p>
<p>Mexican Anti-Chinese Sentiment</p>
<p>The anti-Chinese movement in Mexico was not reasonable, but the matter had not happened in a day or two. There had been anti-Chinese actions several years ago. This matter depended on the strength of the country. If the country was weak, it would be bullied. Therefore, citizens of weak countries were at a disadvantage everywhere.</p>
<p>Studying History and Geography</p>
<p>In addition, Wu also said that he had traveled to the upper reaches of Zhejiang a week or two ago, from Jinhua, Quzhou, and Changshan in Zhejiang to Yushan in Jiangxi. In Yushan, where Wu was standing, there were bandits harassing the defense forces the night before, and they had fought for an hour before being repelled. Wu believed that China's territory was vast, and customs and human conditions varied from place to place. It was impossible to understand the reality of things without experiencing them firsthand. Therefore, "building a car behind closed doors" could not be a thousand miles in harmony. He usually liked to study geography and history, and he was especially interested in traveling to various places. He said that he had benefited a lot from this trip.</p>

<p>The pirates, who had pretended to be passengers, wrapped their heads in white cloth, each carrying guns and weapons, launched an attack in three routes. First, they destroyed the ship's radio, making it impossible to send a distress signal. They monitored the driver and engaged in looting, forcing purser Huang Daqin to reveal the location where the silver was hidden, and robbing 580 yuan that was stored in the accounting room. They then carried out large-scale looting, and no passenger was spared. It was calculated that Huang Qin Chen, a special agent of the Third Regiment of the 19th Route Army, carried 2,670 yuan, and Zhang You of the Quanzhou Headquarters of the 19th Route Army, Passengers Lin Li, Guo Dafa, Gan Dashi, etc.,</p>

When the sky was slightly bright on the morning of the 26th, the pirates forced the crew to launch a lifeboat, tied up the purser Huang Daqin with hemp rope, boarded the boat, landed on the mountain road near Qilun, and left. The lifeboat and crew were released. After the pirates left, the shipowner turned to Shantou, and arrived in Shantou that evening, and telegraphed the Shanghai head office.</p>

<p>The Second Charity Football Match Watched by Tens of Thousands</p>
<p>Donghua Encounters a Strong Enemy and Suffers a Major Defeat for the First Time</p>
<p>Western League Wins Seven to Three</p>
<p>Donghua Leads Two to One in the First Half</p>
<p>Western League Scores Six Consecutive Goals After Three to One</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this football season, no less than twenty matches, large and small, have been held in the China Baseball Field, but none can compare to yesterday's second charity football match between the Donghua and Western League mixed teams in terms of the significance of the mission, the gathering of Chinese and Western stars, and the liveliness of the male and female spectators. Chinese and Western men and women were generous with their donations, rushing to be first. Old Mr. Ma Xiangbo also sat among them. The baseball field was crowded with people, and the traffic was heavy. According to statistics, more than 400 five-yuan tickets, more than 1,400 one-yuan tickets, and more than 8,000 fifty-cent tickets were sold. The income is estimated to be more than 7,000 yuan. The Xie Jin Association will formally report the details in the near future. The result of the battle was seven to three, with the Western League team winning. The referee was Yue Xiurong, and the linesmen were Shen Huichun and Wu Shouheng.</p>
<p>The Three Players from China Deserve Commendation</p>
<p>| Center Back Hayes Was the Best in the Entire Field |</p>
<p>The Western League mixed team gathered the best players from various teams and was formed in a short time. Communication was not easy, and the hope of victory was naturally less. Unexpectedly, heroes create opportunities, and they managed to reverse the dangerous situation and gain an advantage against Donghua. No one could surpass their strong center back line. The cooperation in the middle was lacking, but the wings made considerable contributions. Zhong Yongshen initially appeared unremarkable, but later he repeatedly kicked corner kicks with accurate landing points, becoming a hero. Sun Jinshun, known for his iron legs, showed off his power and was unstoppable. Chen Zhenhe was energetic and capable of both offense and defense. All three players from China made contributions. However, the player who was the most outstanding in the entire team in terms of defense and offense was center back Hayes. The inner guards were weaker, and the goalkeeper was mediocre.</p>

<p>Loss of Balance Leads to Complete Collapse</p>
<p>| Two Players Injured and the Iron Gate Cannot Be Salvaged |</p>
<p>Donghua's internal iron wall and external agility have long been admired by general football fans. In the first half of yesterday's match, with the help of the wind, they made progress in all directions and were unstoppable. Starting in the second half, Feng Yunyou and Li Ning were injured one after another, and the entire team lost its balance. Zhou Xianyan was trapped in the encirclement, and the iron gate fell repeatedly and could not be salvaged. The five forwards were blocked by the opponent and could not advance. Wu Youliang, Tu Kaiyuan, and Guan Xun'an united to defend firmly, but it was of no avail. In short, the entire line collapsed and could not be salvaged. Although they worked hard, they were at the end of their rope and could not do anything.</p>
<p>Donghua Takes the Lead Two to One</p>
<p>| Mayor Wu Performs the Opening Kick |</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, Mayor Wu stepped onto the field and performed the opening kick. As soon as he kicked, the two armies moved together, and the audience applauded and cheered. Li Yichen blocked the advancing army and led the three armies to counterattack. Chen Zhenhe suddenly broke out from the side and passed the ball to Zhong Yongshen, who went straight down the side and turned it into a corner kick. Zhong kicked the ball perfectly, and Hughes lightly bounced it back. Li Ning blocked the goal and calmly cleared the ball. Hayes was penalized for a free kick, and Tu Kaiyuan took the kick, which landed in front of the goal. Li Yichen chased the ball, and the goalkeeper hesitated slightly. Chen Hongyuan swept the ball out from the side and into the net. The Western League lost one goal. Immediately, they adjusted their forces and counterattacked. Hughes picked up the ball, and Zhou Xianyan missed it. The ball rolled past the goal, and Sun Jinshun and Ke Laida rushed forward together but failed to receive the ball. Hayes made a mistake and tried to save himself with a corner kick, causing a disaster. Feng Yunyou passed the ball from left to right, and Chen Hongyuan and Wan Xianghua drove side by side to the goal. Wan fell to the ground and shot, scoring another goal. After another ten minutes, the Western League showed its strength. Ke Laida shot a goal twenty yards from the goal, which was very beautiful and spectacular. In the first half, Donghua led two to one.</p>
<p>Western League Reverses the Defeat and Wins</p>
<p>| The Entire Team Does Its Best, Five to One in the Second Half |</p>
<p>The Western League was shocked at the beginning of the second half. Within half a minute, Donghua suddenly used a high pass, picking over the inner defense line. Chen Hongguang rushed forward alone and scored a goal past Hayes, making it three to one. Not long after, Hongguang advanced alone again, but the goalkeeper handled it well, turning defeat into victory. From then on, the Western League rallied and attacked the goal repeatedly. Fortunately, the goalkeeper was skilled and escaped death. After ten minutes, Zhong kicked the ball back from the baseline, Hayes entered the room and shot into the goal, making it two to three. Soon after, Zhong kicked a corner kick, which landed in front of the goal. Xiu had eyes on the top of his head and headed the ball into the goal, making it three to three. Suddenly, Donghua's entire line collapsed, and the enemy's traces could be seen everywhere in half of the country. The iron gate cried out in pain and could not resist. Chen Zhenhe sent the ball far away, Zhou missed it, and it fell behind him. By the time he looked back, Parker had already pushed the ball into the net, making it four to three. Not long after, Sun Iron Leg also shot a goal, making it five to three. Donghua's situation worsened. Zhong Yongshen tried to shoot and also got his wish, making it six to three. The last goal was still kicked by Sun Jinshun, resulting in a final score of seven to three, with the Western League winning. After the match, Mayor Wu distributed the large and small silver cups donated by Minister Song Ziwen to the teams and auctioned off the football. Chinese and Western philanthropists competed to bid, and Sheng Pingchen won it for 200 yuan, which is also a memorable event. The Western League team consisted of</p>

<p>Group Victory/Defeat of Teams Score</p>
<p>(B) Kangyuan Wins Huying 36 to 24</p>
<p>(B) Xinwen Wins Huanian 27 to 12</p>

<p>(A) Huofen Wins Ruhua 45 to 35</p>
<p>The Group A competition uses a double round-robin system. Based on past results, Quanhei and Huofen are the best among them, and other teams are no match for them. In the first round-robin, Huofen defeated Quanhei with a score of 42 to 33. Yesterday was the second week of matches, and Quanhei made a comeback with great momentum. Huofen's strength was greatly reduced due to the absence of Ding Shouyu, a good right guard who was good at both defense and offense. In the first half, they lost with a score of 16 to 24. In the second half, Huofen's entire line was heavily guarded, and Quanhei's iron cavalry was difficult to gallop. They tied with a score of 12 to 12. In total, it was 36 to 28, Quanhei won. Therefore, according to the statistics of the two teams' results, they are once again on equal footing, and a final will be necessary to determine the championship.</p>

<p>I</p>
<p>Counties such as He, Baoqing, Muling, and Dongning are accumulating strength to await the enemy. Although they have repeatedly suffered sneak attacks from stubborn foes, their hearts are filled with fervent patriotism and have never faltered. Zong Dai enlisted in the army as a young man, spending half his life in military service. Now, with a powerful neighbor pressing upon our borders and our land in ruins, how could he dare lag behind others in serving the great cause of patriotism? He has specially inspired his soldiers, personally leading his troops to shoulder the heavy responsibility of resisting Japan and fulfilling the duty of killing the enemy. With utmost sincerity, he is ready to face any hardship, even death. Zong Dai, lacking talent, does not overestimate his own limitations, but he considers himself a general willing to die rather than a contemptible person who would surrender. He does not merely utter heroic words but truly aims to accomplish great deeds. He deeply hopes that all patriots in the country will not remain spectators, will not be divided by regionalism, will demonstrate the spirit of the nation, and will fulfill Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, fighting together and united in resisting Japan. This is the only way to ensure the integrity of our territory and the survival of our nation. This is the task of our time, and the future of China depends on it. I humbly pray that you grant me timely guidance so that I may follow it accordingly. I send this telegram with tears and trepidation.</p>

<p>Chen Youren</p>
<p>To Oversee Southwest Diplomacy</p>
<p>Chen Takes Office as Southwest Political Affairs Committee Member</p>
<p>Southwest Establishes High-Level Diplomatic Organ</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Former Foreign Minister Chen Youren arrived from Shanghai via Hong Kong. During his stay in Hong Kong, he visited Hu Hanmin. He then proceeded to Guangzhou to discuss important matters with the Southwest authorities. After Chen arrived in Guangdong, his movements were rarely known. Zou Lu stated that Chen's trip south did not have any specific mission. However, on the first of this month, Chen attended the Southwest Executive Committee meeting at the invitation of various Central Committee members. During the meeting, the committee members consulted Chen on diplomatic matters. On the second, the Southwest Political Affairs Council held its 67th meeting, attended by members Zou Lu, Deng Zeru, Lin Yun’gai, Yang Xixu, Li Xiaosheng, Qu Fangpu, Zhang Renmin, Lin Yizhong, Liu Jiwen, Chen Jitang, Xiao Focheng, Luo Yiqun, Liu Luyin, Li Pan, and Chen Rong, with Zou Lu as the chair. Zou Lu first reported on over twenty resolutions. The sixth resolution reported a letter from the Secretariat of the Southwest Executive Committee stating that at the 66th Standing Committee meeting, Zou Lu, Deng Zeru, Chen Jitang, and Xiao Focheng had proposed appointing Chen Youren as a member of the Southwest Political Affairs Council, which was approved. The Secretariat was instructed to inform the relevant parties. The Southwest Executive Committee has already delivered the appointment to Chen, who is scheduled to take the oath of office at the Political Affairs Council auditorium on the eighth. It is reported that the Southwest Political Affairs Council will establish a high-level diplomatic organ after Chen takes office, entrusting him with its leadership and announcing the Southwest's diplomatic positions to the world at any time.

<p>Activities of Japanese Merchants in Hankou</p>
<p>Buying Over Traitors</p>
<p>Dumping Inferior Goods</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Japanese merchants residing in Hankou previously held a general meeting of all overseas merchants in mid-April, requesting assistance from the Japanese authorities due to the boycott of inferior goods, which caused unsold goods and commercial stagnation. The Japanese Naval Fleet Commander Banno and Consul Shimizu Hachiro also convened secret meetings twice and made certain decisions. As a result, the clamor of Japanese merchants gradually subsided. However, the details of their decisions have remained unknown for a long time. Recently, clues have gradually emerged. The Japanese merchants have always colluded with treacherous merchants. Since the founding of the Republic, boycotts of inferior goods have been conducted five times, but the sales volume eventually exceeded that before the boycotts. This was all due to the actions of treacherous merchants. This year, the [unreadable] group has been quite active, and the leading treacherous merchants have been eliminated one after another. The loss of this reliance has affected the commercial prospects of Japanese merchants, who have been forced to seek help from the Japanese authorities. After secret deliberations, the Japanese authorities decided to change their approach, buying over traitors since it was not easy to directly collude with treacherous merchants. It is said that quite a few people have been bought over. The Japanese merchants have also jointly established a goods sales association to handle the matter secretly, with the Japanese Qingci Xiuji in charge. A liaison office has been set up in the Japanese concession, and a branch office has been set up near the Houhualou residential area on Huajie, with the traitor Zhu Youbing responsible for liaison. It is said that the daily sales of inferior goods amount to more than ten thousand yuan. The commercial authorities are currently investigating this matter in order to take measures to ban it.</p>
<p>The Japanese have concentrated thirteen warships in the Han River under the pretext of protecting merchants and overseas residents. After six ships were transferred elsewhere, the remaining seven ships, namely Tsushima, Katata, Otaka, Momo, Yanagi, Kashi, and Hinoki, and the two gunboats Ataka and Futami, were used by Banno and Kukoji to inspect Changsha and Yichang. Kukoji inspected the Toba and Atami ships in Changsha and the Uji and Seta ships in Yichang, also extending his regards to the officers and soldiers of each fleet. On the fifth, Kukoji returned to Hankou from Yichang on the Futami, and on the sixth, he transferred to the Tenryu and went to Shanghai, then on to Qingdao. Banno arrived in Hankou from Yichang and remains in charge. (May 6th)</p>
<p>The New Situation in Suppressing Bandits in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Region</p>
<p>The Main Bandit Forces Gather in Huangma, Eastern Hubei</p>
<p>Headquarters for Suppressing Bandits in the Border Region Established in Huangchuan</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Bandits in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border region have recently gathered their main forces in the Huangma counties of Eastern Hubei, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. At the beginning of the bandit resurgence, there were only two to three thousand people who dug up buried guns and harassed everywhere. Later, they absorbed scattered bandits from various places and coerced the masses, and their strength has grown. Now they are more than ten thousand people. The troops stationed there, under Wei Lihuang and Wan Yaohuang, have been successively dispatched to suppress them. However, due to the bandits' elusive movements, it is not easy to annihilate them. The bandits attacked the weak points, and actually captured Sanhekou, which belongs to Macheng. Later, the national army recovered Sanhekou. The bandits then fled in two directions, eastwards to the Songziguan and Changgangling areas in Huang'an County via the Lipu County border, and westwards to the Qiting and Songbu areas in Macheng County via the Fu County border. The Huangma counties were in a state of panic almost every day. Chiang Kai-shek, seeing the bandits' rampant activities, specially appointed Liu Zhenhua as the Commander-in-Chief of the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Region for Suppressing Bandits, responsible for supervising the suppression. Liu's troops were also ordered to successively move to Hubei. After receiving the order, Liu immediately sent personnel to Huangchuan to organize the headquarters, while he himself left Nanyang for Xuchang on the fourth and took a special train to Hankou to discuss everything with He Chengjun. Liu arrived in Xu on the fifth, where Liang Guanying arrived from Hankou. Together they headed south. They arrived in Hankou at 6 pm on the sixth. That night, he discussed the bandit suppression plan with He Chengjun and planned to stay in Hankou for three days before returning to Nanyang. He will then move to Huangchuan to supervise the suppression after the border region headquarters is established. The troops stationed in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border region have all received telegrams ordering them to be under Liu's command, giving him full authority.</p>
<p>Due to various difficulties, the suppression of bandits in western Hubei has not progressed smoothly. Fan Xiji, who was ordered to supervise the suppression, was granted a half-month leave by Chiang Kai-shek. He will return to Hankou within days to report on the bandit situation to He. Xu Yuanquan, the overall commander of bandit suppression in western Hubei, is scheduled to go to the front line on the seventh to replace Fan and take charge of the command. According to Xu's telegram to the Sui Jing Gong Shu, the Red Bandit pseudo-Xiangbei Independent Regiment fled from the border area near Jingzhong to the area where Qianjiang and Mianyang meet. The 34th Division and the 38th Independent Brigade were dispatched to encircle and suppress them, and they were defeated. Another group fled back from Honghu to Datitou in Jianli, attempting to enter Dongting Lake. They were also surrounded and annihilated by the 19th Division and local troops. He's bandits are now trapped in Wuhe and cannot cross Leichi Lake again. However, they are building fortifications on the mountains and intend to hold their ground. It is expected that there will be a bloody battle when Xu arrives at the front line. (May 6th)</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Returns</p>
<p>Ancient Paintings from the Summer Palace</p>
<p>| Returned to the Summer Palace by Zhou Dawen |</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: The ancient paintings of the Summer Palace, which were borrowed by Zhang Xueliang, then Acting Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission Branch, while he was recuperating in the Summer Palace. These paintings included Qian Weicheng's two albums of "Scenic Views of West Lake," Emperor Qianlong's inscription on Yong Rong's "Orchid Painting," a "Longevity and Wealth" flower painting, a "Nine Songs" painting by Li Gonglin, a "Seven-Character Verse" by Chen Tingjing, a "Listening to the Zither under Pine Trees" painting by Zhao Mengfu, a "Zhuan Sun Xiang Zi" painting by Yuan Ying, an album of flower paintings by Qian Weicheng, an album of flower paintings by Jiang Tingxi, an album of "Plowing and Weaving" paintings by Jiao Bingzhen, and an album of flower paintings by Jiang Tingxi, totaling thirteen items or fifteen pieces. Later, due to the hurried departure from Beiping, they could not be returned and were deposited in a bank in Tianjin. Zhu Guangmu telegraphed Zhou Dawen, the mayor of Beiping, on April 9th, asking him to work with Hu Ruoyu to be responsible for returning them. Zhou brought them back from Tianjin to Beiping on the 3rd and immediately handed them over to the Summer Palace Management Office. They were then jointly reviewed by members of the Summer Palace Appraisal Committee and the Palace Museum and found to be correct. The office then prepared to pack them and transport them to Nanjing along with the fifth batch of antiquities from the Palace Museum.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan previously telegraphed Beiping to transport all the antiquities from the Summer Palace to Nanjing. After Liu Minjun was sent to Beiping to inspect the results, he found that most of them did not need to be transported. The important antiquities were then packed and transported south. The first batch of more than 200 boxes has already been transported south along with the fourth batch of antiquities from the Palace Museum. Packing continues, and more than 300 boxes have been packed and will be transported south along with the fifth batch of antiquities from the Palace Museum. (May 5th)</p>

<h3>Change</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>"If Qi makes a change, it can reach Lu. If Lu makes a change, it can reach the Way." This is a thorough transformation, a truly excellent change!</p>
<p>Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, Niu Mowang, and the Black Wind Demon can transform themselves into beautiful women or refined scholars. Although their outward appearance changes, their inner nature remains the same. This kind of change is not particularly clever.</p>
<p>The Investiture of the Gods says: "Daji recruited many orphaned fox descendants and transformed them into the appearance of immortals, drinking wine on the Deer Terrace. They drank too much, and each of them had a large, fluffy tail dragging behind them." This kind of change is called the fox spirit revealing its true form, the most [unreadable] change.</p>
<p>Magicians on stage, wearing neat formal attire, use the principles of optics, acoustics, and hypnotism to perform changes that are unpredictable and truly amazing.</p>
<p>A large crowd surrounds a square, banging gongs and drums. A Shandong man, bare-chested, breathes fire and kills a child in a jar, which is also deemed a wonderful performance.</p>
<p>Only the tricks done by monkeys, though dressed in red clothes, wearing masks, and able to mimic Li Sanniang carrying water or Wang Botang seeking a bride, are still just monkeys and cannot transform into humans.</p>
<p>"Everyone can perform magic tricks, each with their own cleverness." Let's watch the tricks being performed on the world stage!</p>
<p>Lenin mutters incantations and points his magic wand, transforming the extreme right dictatorship into extreme left communism. This trick is very clever.</p>
<p>Kemal crouches down, covers something with a cloth, and when he uncovers it, the sickly and melancholic Turkey is instantly rejuvenated, a very skillful transformation.</p>
<p>Now Mussolini, Hitler, Roosevelt... are also performing great magic tricks. Whether these tricks are good or bad, wonderful or not, please watch closely!</p>
<p>What kind of trick is China performing now? I'll keep that a secret and won't tell you. Perhaps it's Western magic, perhaps Chinese magic, perhaps it's a monkey show. It must be one of the three.</p>
<p>"Definitive judgment comes with the coffin." Only after a person dies can their rights and wrongs be determined. If China does not perish, we cannot be sure whether this trick is good or bad!</p>
<h3>Tokyo Will Sink to the Bottom of the Sea</h3>
<p>— Yong Zi</p>
<p>The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun reported that Mr. Miyamura Naoki, a technician at the Earthquake Research Institute of the Imperial University, based on a survey by the Road Construction Section of the Tokyo Municipal Civil Engineering Bureau, stated that in the next two years, Tokyo and its surrounding areas will gradually sink into the bottom of the Eastern Ocean. It is said that all the people of Tokyo are greatly alarmed.</p>
<p>The Japanese come to kill, set fires, throw bombs, and seize land, and we Chinese "resist because we cannot fight." This is a matter of great grief and heartache. But when it comes to "killing and arson," China cannot match Japan. However, if we are talking about "schadenfreude," cursing and scolding, then we Chinese are much stronger. Since the birth of the "national crisis," patriotic friends who "chant scriptures with meat in their mouths and curse with vegetarian mouths" have all been praying to Fuxi, King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, burning incense and lighting candles, that Heaven will bring great misfortune to Japan and that there will be another major earthquake so that China can easily recover its lost territories without lifting a finger. If Mr. Miyamura Naoki's scientific prediction comes true, that would truly be "Amitabha, heaven has eyes."</p>
<p>Not long ago, a certain gentleman gave a speech saying that Japan would have a major revolution within ten years. At that time, they would vomit the Northeast whole out of their stomachs and return it to China. At the time, many people were whispering behind his back, thinking that it would not be so easy. But according to Mr. Miyamura Naoki's statement, it seems that, haha, why ten years? The seas change into mulberry fields. Isn't it that heaven will destroy Japan in two years?</p>
<p>I remember ten years ago, an astronomer said that on a certain day, the planet Venus would collide with the head of the Earth, and the Earth would be smashed into powder. At the time, the more intelligent Chinese people dug cellars to avoid the great catastrophe. I think that the panicked people of Tokyo could well imitate this method. If the Japanese are so stupid that they can't even imitate this method, then they can only shorten the "three-year plan to destroy Manchuria" and complete it within two years, so that they can move the capital to Fengtian.</p>
<h3>Urban Jottings</h3>
<p>— Guo Lanxin</p>
<p>It is now the early summer season when the flowing water carries away fallen flowers and spring has passed. In the coal smoke-shrouded city, besides the perpetually yellow and turbid waters of the Huangpu River, one cannot see a clear stream. The women on the streets, with their white faces and rouge lips, and their colorful robes fluttering, revealing the curvaceous waistlines beneath their fur coats, are bewitching. Besides these, one cannot see a single fallen flower or a petal of withered red. Besides the groans of many laborers under the oppression of work, one cannot hear the weeping of cuckoos. As for flocks of orioles flying about, they can only be seen when the prostitutes in the areas of Dongxin Bridge, Beijing Road, and Toujiao Bridge are being chased by the police. The natural scenery in the city will disappoint anyone. Even in the semi-colonial concessions, there are a few parks to adorn the city, but the citizens feel somewhat ashamed to step inside, knowing that their money is being used by foreigners to run the parks, and at the same time, they are all artificial decorations.</p>
<p>Ever since the city became acquainted with and cohabited with prosperity and sin, it has abandoned spring. Although spring is gorgeously dressed, the city can no longer enjoy it and can only be surrounded by the greasy glamour of lights and wine. The city repents in its moments of clarity, but everything is too late. Spring is unwilling to throw itself into the city's embrace. Besides gently blowing in the spring breeze to report news, it will no longer have the same intimacy with the city that it had before the city became acquainted with and cohabited with prosperity and sin. Every year, spring continues to bless the happy and comfort the heartbroken, while also bringing grief and sorrow to the sad! In this way, spring gradually forgets the city amidst cursing its fickleness.</p>
<h3>Spring Night</h3>
<p>— Yi Qiu</p>
<p>Our China has always been a country of peace and prosperity. Now that spring is deep, the hotels on the shores of West Lake are all fully booked. The dance halls and theaters on the banks of the Huangpu River are crowded everywhere. Look! Aren't they singing and dancing in a world of wine, green lights, and prosperity? Now, our country, although there are some insignificant foreign invasions, it doesn't matter. The National Crisis Conference has already been held, and our government has long had a "comprehensive plan" and is already "resisting for the long term." There is no need for us ordinary people to worry. As for the recent bankruptcy of the rural economy, which does pose some danger to the national economy and the people's livelihood, it also doesn't matter. The "Rural Reconstruction Committee" has already been established, so there is no need for us to disturb ourselves!</p>
<p>In this moment when "spring is annoying and keeps me from sleeping," although I cannot compose poems about the wind and the moon, let me "indulge in some leisurely feelings."</p>
<p>Flowers always bloom quietly, away from people,</p>
<p>And wither without people noticing!</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Spring comes slowly,</p>
<p>But leaves in a hurry!</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>The moon has seen countless lovers' smiles,</p>
<p>And countless loners' tears.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>The thing that knows no warmth or cold is the gentle breeze,</p>
<p>Because it often approaches the poorest of people.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Water can wash away the dirt on people's bodies,</p>
<p>But who can wash away the dirt on the soul?</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Wine is the most lovable thing,</p>
<p>Because it can blur my life.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Love is a dazzling flash of light,</p>
<p>Able to cover up the ugliness behind it.</p>
<p>New news from the art world: Mr. Zhang Zhenlü founded the Good Morning Friends Society at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road in Shanghai for ten years, producing hundreds of types of Good Morning stationery.</p>
<p>It is now holding a sale. Among its products is "Good Morning Stationery Landscape Painting No. 1," which is a collection of twenty landscape paintings by the old painter Ma Henian, reproduced and printed. Each book has one hundred pages, made of Chinese paper, divided into four, three, half, and one-third grades, all sold at a 10% discount. In addition, the original green landscape paintings have been carefully mounted and sold at a low price. Four-foot vertical scrolls are only twelve yuan, and three-foot scrolls are nine yuan. Zhenlü's cursive calligraphy couplets are also mounted and sold at a low price for display. Five-foot couplets are only five yuan, and four-foot couplets are four yuan. It is said that there are not many of these ready-made mounted couplets left.</p>

<h3>Random Chat by the Stove</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Different Stoves</p>
<p>The problem of food is one of the three essentials of life. Cooking methods vary from place to place, and even the stoves used to solve the "problem of food" are very different.</p>
<p>In the Jiangnan area, most of the stoves are large brick stoves with long chimneys. Ordinary ones have three sleeping stoves and two-eye stoves. Stoves with two pots are called two-eye stoves, and stoves with three pots are called three-eye stoves. These large stoves are built in the kitchen, and the fuel used is mostly thatch and rice straw. When using them, one person must tend the fire so that another person can calmly stir-fry the dishes. Otherwise, if one person has to tend the fire and stir-fry the dishes at the same time, the fire will be either too big or too small, and the dishes will be either undercooked or burnt. Piling up fuel is especially cumbersome and time-consuming. Hundreds of catties or two hundred catties of firewood are piled up to fill a room, which is considered a firewood room. Just imagine, in densely populated urban areas, where housing is already a problem, where can you find spare space to use as a fuel warehouse? Therefore, this kind of old-fashioned and clumsy large stove is no longer suitable.</p>
<p>In the north, ordinary people use coal stoves to burn cooked coal or coal balls. However, most of them do not have chimneys, and the coal gas accumulates and lingers in the room, making it easy for people to absorb the coal poison. This is especially unsuitable for people with lung diseases. Although some people say that boiling water vapor can解煤毒, it is still a dangerous thing! Therefore, a chimney must be installed before using a coal stove. However, coal stoves are still more convenient and practical than large thatch-burning stoves. At least, the first thing, daily hot water, can be relieved of worry! In our Jiangsu and Zhejiang area, there are water-selling "tiger stoves," but the water brewed in the tiger stoves is often not boiled water. Some people have even gotten sick from drinking unboiled water.</p>
<p>"Portable stoves" seem very convenient and can be moved anywhere. They are quite suitable for the nomadic lifestyle of the general public. What we often see soldiers "burying the pot to cook" is the so-called portable stove. The fuel required is mainly firewood, which is not suitable for home use.</p>
<p>In sparsely populated areas, burning coal in stoves is considered troublesome, so many people now use "white clay stoves," which are truly convenient and easy to use. It is most convenient to light two white clay stoves at the same time, one for cooking rice and one for cooking dishes. The stove chamber is small, so it saves coal balls, and it is also the fastest to light. These types of white clay stoves were formerly used for warming around the stove in winter, but now they have taken the place of the kitchen stove.</p>
<p>Many families simplify things and use "kerosene stoves" to cook dishes and rice. Although this can be done with difficulty, it is like "meeting a slow doctor in a sudden illness," and it is definitely not suitable for impatient people. Because the time it takes to cook dishes and rice on a kerosene stove is three to four times longer than on a coal stove. If you only use one kerosene stove to cook, you don't have to do anything else all day. Three meals a day are enough to keep you busy!</p>
<p>In the bustling city, there are gas stoves and electric stoves, which are naturally clean and convenient, but because they are too expensive, very few people use them. In the interior, they are even rarer, so I will skip them for now.</p>
<p>Stove Equipment</p>
<p>In fact, everyone knows that the "problem of food" is very important, but the equipment around the stove is often too neglected! Either the equipment is not complete, or it is often lost and scattered, requiring you to search for it everywhere. Cutting vegetables is often used for other work. A single rag has many uses: lining the pot, wiping oily knives, wiping pots, wiping vegetable bowls, and wiping water stains from rice bowls. You can't do without it. It's greasy and dirty, and you never see a clean day. However, "illness enters through the mouth." We are so unhygienic when it comes to the problem of food, which is really worrying. Therefore, to improve the stove area, there should be stove equipment.</p>
<p>The Responsibility of the Housewife</p>
<p>"The housewife manages the household," is an old saying. Whether women should learn to cook is a question. However, since the housewife manages the household, and the problem of food is an essential element of life, she cannot ignore it. However, fashionable housewives are unwilling to go into the kitchen. In fact, going into the kitchen is not despicable. Housewives in Europe and America can all cook themselves. China is known for its "eating," so why are housewives unwilling to take on some responsibility? In fact, "entering the kitchen every two or three days and washing hands to make soup" is also a dignified and respectable thing.</p>

<p>He frowned and stamped his feet, saying, "I told you to take care of him, but you didn't. Look, he's made a mess of me. Now you can hold him, right?" Madam Yuan smiled, took the child, and said repeatedly, "Let's go, let's go, you've caused trouble." Then she hugged the child and ran into the inner room. Guan Yaowu stood dazedly in the middle of the room, holding his coat in both hands, unable to move, muttering incessantly. Yin Deren smiled and said, "Old Zhao, did you see that? That's entertainment." Guan Yaowu frowned and said, "Speaking of it, it's really annoying. When I get home, if I don't hold the child, he cries for me to hold him. But when I do hold him, he makes a mess of me." Madam Yuan said from inside the room, "Come in, let me wipe you off." Guan Yaowu shook his head, holding his coat, and went in. They could hear the husband and wife whispering to each other inside. Madam Yuan said, "You're going out of the city today. Do you know when you'll be back? Leave some extra money at home for spending." Guan Yaowu said, "It's only been two days since the New Year, and you want money again? I only get eighty percent of my salary for the New Year, but you want to take double that from me." Madam Yuan said, "I haven't even mentioned the New Year yet. The New Year, the New Year, all the money I've saved up bit by bit has been spent to cover expenses. Speaking of it, you have to give me money to pay me back." Guan Yaowu shouted, "I only have this much money on me. You've taken it all. What will I use?" Madam Yuan shouted back, "I don't care." As she spoke, there was a flurry of footsteps inside the room, and Guan Yaowu ran out with a red face. Zhao Ziqiang said, "What's wrong? Are you negotiating with your sister-in-law again?" Guan Yaowu shook his head and said, "Don't mention it. She snatched my wallet." Madam Yuan rushed out of the room and laughed, "Don't listen to him, you two. I need sixty or seventy dollars for New Year's expenses, but he only gave me thirty. How can I do without the money I owe people? I had to take out my own money to pay off the debts. Now that we've gotten through the New Year, he won't acknowledge the debt. How can I not deduct his money?" Guan Yaowu glared at his wife, wanting to say something, but he held it back. He shook his head at her a few times and said, "If it weren't the second day of the New Year, I would really say something harsh." "Let's go, let's go out of the city." Battalion Commander Guan looked angry but dared not speak. Yin and Zhao had no choice but to follow him out. (63)</p>

<h3>Overview of Dr. Muhlens' Speech (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>(Our social circles should pay attention to the astounding state of modern science.)</p>
<p>Hamburg, Germany, is Germany's only commercial port. It is like Shanghai in China, a gathering place for merchants from all over the world. The types of diseases are also more complex. Therefore, the German Institute for Tropical Diseases is located in the University of Hamburg. There is a professor named PROF. MUEHLENS. During the European War, he used his expertise in bacteriology and hygiene to do a great deal of work in the army and in the city. Now he is in the tropical hospital, studying important categories such as biology, bacteria, and parasites. His reputation is prominent. He, Dr. KOLLE (who co-invented the Wassermann test for syphilis with Dr. Wassermann and is also a master), and Dr. KNOLL have all been to several tropical places for field investigations. Therefore, his experience is really rich. This time, he came to China to lecture at the invitation of our government and the medical community, and brought many lecture materials, such as slides and motion pictures. Three weeks ago, he gave six lectures (the same topic) in German and English at Baolong Hospital and Renji Hospital in Shanghai. I went to four of the six lectures at Baolong Hospital. Now I will write down what I saw and heard in these four lectures to make the public understand the research methods of modern medicine and the realm that has been reached. In particular, I would like to ask old-style doctors to read it calmly and peacefully. If they do not believe it, then Muhlens is still in Nanjing and can be invited to broaden their horizons. It is not a foreign tale, and there is no way to verify it for a while. However, this article will omit overly detailed specialized terms and overly deep medical theories in order to be popular and save space.</p>
<p>The first topic was "Spirochetes. SPIROCHAETA." He spoke for two days, and in addition to talking about the bacteria's own movements, properties, and living conditions, he also talked about the pathological manifestations caused by this type of bacteria. You all know that the pathogen of syphilis is also a type of spirochete infection, but it has a special name, called SPIROCHAETA PALLIDA. However, other dental diseases and acute jaundice are also caused by spirochetes. In the past, the shape of spirochetes was studied using the ink staining method. On a black glass slide, we could see white thread-like spirochete bodies. Later, the movement of spirochetes could only be seen using the dark-field method. This time, Dr. Muhlens brought a brand new film, which used microphotography to capture the movement of bacteria in the dark field into a movie film. Or, the various culture conditions of bacteria were filmed. Or, pus and blood from a patient's body were placed on a glass slide and filmed. This kind of film, after being magnified, can be viewed by thousands of people. Therefore, the lectures were vivid and engaging. Even how spirochetes disrupt human flesh and how blood cells fight at this time are clear at a glance.</p>
<p>Since the study of the movement of this bacterium has made further progress, we can further subdivide the types of bacteria by the difference in movement. The RECURRENS SPIROCHAETA relapsing fever spirochete and another type of LEPTOSPIRA, as indicated by Muhlens this time, have very different movements. One is like a fish swimming, and the other is like an earthworm twisting. If we take the concept of studying biology, we can distinguish the living states of various small organisms under a microscope, just like distinguishing donkeys and horses on the ground, then we can be called "investigating things to acquire knowledge." However, there are several types of small spirochetes that are often not visible in the excrement or pus and blood of ordinary human bodies. They must be injected into the bodies of animals (such as rabbits) before they can be found. This article will not discuss it in detail.</p>
<p>The second topic on the third day was "Hygiene in the World War." What was said that day was mostly military hygiene and many wartime disease statistics. He said that during the war, many diseases were transmitted from the lice on the soldiers' bodies. The most obvious is typhus. In addition, mosquitoes transmit malaria, causing soldiers to have fever and reducing combat effectiveness. Later, they thought of engaging in louse-catching and mosquito-swatting campaigns, which were planned by military doctors and strictly enforced by the commander-in-chief. Sure enough, it was very effective. In addition, he also talked about the nutritional problems during the war and reported some statistics on prisoners suffering from tuberculosis. According to him, 60-70% of the German soldiers captured by Russia gradually developed tuberculosis. The Russian soldiers captured by Germany received a lot of medical assistance and had fewer deaths.</p>
<p>Many of the slides shown that day were temporary military clothing sterilizers made during field operations. The simplest one only used an empty gasoline drum, with wooden fences in the middle, half-filled with water, and stones piled up at the bottom. Digging a pit and burning trees could dry-steam a lot of soldiers' military uniforms and kill lice. There was also a temporary bathhouse. The simple one was only made of wooden boards, or even just surrounded by cloth. The soldiers took off their clothes and took a bath. After the bath, they put on their clothes, which had already been steamed. In addition, saddles and leather goods were disinfected with very simple methods. At most, the lice on the bodies of 10,000 soldiers could be completely eliminated in one day. A doctor who studied parasitology once counted the number of louse eggs on a suspender at that time, and there were more than 6,000. Although things are not common, it can be seen that they have a spirit of studying medicine.</p>
<h3>How to Maintain Physical Health (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Junsun</p>
<p>(3) How to Maintain Your Physical Health?</p>
<p>As mentioned above, a person is like a machine on a car, and must be checked frequently to see if there are any small problems, whether small screws are loose, and if they are, tighten them. Where the machine is damaged, it should be repaired, where it should be oiled, and do not let the machine get too hot. This kind of thing should be paid attention to by everyone at any time, and engineers should be asked to check it regularly, so that small problems can be repaired immediately, and big problems will not occur. People's bodies are also like this. Unfortunately, we Chinese people are too unaccustomed to using this clever machine, and often die young. They also do not trust engineers, and every machine thinks that they are an engineer, and often cause big troubles, which is a pity!</p>
<p>Speaking of checking physical health on time, there is a kind of institution in the United States that we think can be adopted. They check more than 100,000 people every year, and there are more than 10,000 doctors serving in it. Their checks are divided into physics, chemistry, microscopy, as well as blood serum, X-rays, etc. Nothing is not checked. If there is a place with disease, it is clearly pointed out in the report, and they are also told about the remedy. In this way, a big disease can be turned into a small disease, a small disease can be turned into no disease, and it is not difficult to achieve longevity. In the near future, I also plan to take on this kind of work, because it is very important for the health of our nation and the future of the country!</p>
<h3>On Drinking, Continued (3)</h3>
<p>— Xuexiu</p>
<p>In addition to the four types of drinking described, the "Golden Chamber" also describes the symptoms of latent drinking and lingering drinking, saying, "The person's back is cold, like a large amount of water." It also says, "Pain under the ribs, radiating to the supraclavicular fossa; coughing makes it stop," (or "worse,") and, "The person has shortness of breath and thirst, pain in the joints of the four limbs; a sunken pulse indicates lingering drinking." The "Origin of Diseases" says, "It is caused by drinking too much water after drinking alcohol. The water vapor stays in the chest and diaphragm and does not dissipate, causing pain under the ribs, shortness of breath, and rapid breathing." The "Thousand Gold Prescriptions" says, "Lingering drinking does not manifest in shape, has no heat, a weak pulse, fullness, and cannot eat; a sunken and slippery pulse indicates lingering drinking. The person with lingering drinking has pain under the ribs, radiating to the supraclavicular fossa; coughing makes it worse; the person coughs and cannot lie down, has pain radiating to the back of the neck; coughing resembles a child's convulsion." It also says in the "Great Five Drink Pill," "The first is lingering drinking, where water is retained under the heart." The verifiable records from the Han and Tang Dynasties are roughly exhausted here. The three words "like a large amount of water" in "cold back, like a large amount of water" in the "Golden Chamber" do not make sense. The "Pulse Classic" and "Thousand Gold Prescriptions" say "as large as a hand." The two words "makes it stop" in "coughing makes it stop" are incomprehensible; it is said to be "worse." Whenever there is pain in the body, coughing will pull on it, and the pain will definitely increase. There is no such thing as coughing stopping the pain. The "Pulse Classic" correctly says "worse" and should be used to correct it. The "Thousand Gold Prescriptions" also says "worse," and below it also says, "Coughing resembles a child's convulsion." This describes the coughing becoming worse. If coughing made it stop, then the state should be comfortable; why would it resemble a convulsion? In summary, the symptoms of lingering drinking are a cold back as large as a hand, pain under the ribs radiating to the supraclavicular fossa, coughing making it worse, shortness of breath and thirst, pain in the joints of the four limbs, not manifesting in shape, no heat, fullness and cannot eat, coughing and cannot lie down, pain radiating to the back of the neck, coughing resembling a child's convulsion. Among these, pain under the ribs radiating to the supraclavicular fossa and coughing making it worse are close to hanging drinking, and shortness of breath and cannot lie down are close to propping drinking. However, propping drinking does not cause thirst, which is the point of difference. Not manifesting in shape means that the disease is always like this and does not change much, unlike overflowing drinking which "has times of aggravation." No heat means that it is not an acute inflammatory disease. Fullness and cannot eat means that it affects the stomach. Pain in the joints of the four limbs indicates the symptoms of polyarthritis. A cold back as large as a hand often occurs in people with mitral valve prolapse, and thirst is also a symptom of patients with stomach dilation. Coughing resembling a child's convulsion means that the coughing is so severe that it causes pain, making gestures to resist it. Now, according to polyarthritis, it often occurs with endocarditis, so in the "Golden Chamber's" chapter on wind through the joints, it says that wind through the joints is like water damaging the heart, because its symptoms, in addition to pain in the limbs, such as shortness of breath and swollen feet, are clearly diseases of the heart, similar to what is called propping drinking. Since the "Golden Chamber" says that propping drinking is water in the heart, it also says that wind through the joints is water damaging the heart. Comprehensively considering all the symptoms, it is known that what the ancients called Liu Drinking did not refer to one disease, such as hanging drinking, such as propping drinking, and even those with wind through the joints who had valvular heart disease, were all attributed to Liu Drinking. As for the symptoms of latent drinking, it says, "Phlegm above the diaphragm, fullness, panting, coughing, vomiting, fever and chills when it occurs, back pain, waist pain, tears flowing from the eyes, the person trembles, and the body twitches severely." According to the "Golden Chamber," it does not mention phlegm alone, and it has already been discussed in the discourse on phlegm. The two words "disease phlegm" are suspected to be erroneous. According to the "Pulse Classic," "Thousand Gold Prescriptions," and "Outer Platform Secret Essentials," the two words "disease phlegm" are all written as "disease of," which proves that the two words "disease phlegm" are actually an erroneous text in the "Golden Chamber" and should be corrected according to the "Pulse Classic," "Thousand Gold Prescriptions," and "Outer Platform Secret Essentials." The description of the symptoms of latent drinking is not seen anywhere else. The theories of various schools are mixed and inconsistent. For example, Xu Kezhong believed that it was phlegm drinking or propping drinking that was latent and not immediately manifested. You Zhuowu believed that it was phlegm drinking that was latent and unnoticed. Zhu Mingjun believed that it was propping drinking that was latent and hidden for a long time. The "Medical Sect Golden Mirror" believed that it was lingering drinking that was latent and not manifested, which is what the world calls asthma. However, after careful examination of its symptoms, fullness, panting, coughing, and vomiting are its common symptoms, even when the disease does not occur. Fever, chills, back pain, waist pain, dizziness, and body twitching are symptoms when it occurs, and there are no symptoms when the disease does not occur. This is not a stomach disease. Stomach disease has no fever or chills. Although the "Outer Platform Secret Essentials" quotes the symptoms of lingering drinking and food retention in the "Origin of Diseases," there are words of strong fever, and the "Thousand Gold Prescriptions" decoction of Heracleum and honey has words of fever and chills. These are all the faults of the ancients' inaccurate observation and vague descriptions of symptoms. According to today's disease experience, acute gastritis still has strong fever similar to typhoid fever, but chronic gastritis does not. As for panting and coughing, it is even less of a constant symptom of stomach disease. Latent drinking is also not a heart disease. Although heart disease also has fullness and panting, there are no symptoms of "fever and chills, back pain, and waist pain when it occurs." Comprehensively considering the symptoms of latent drinking, only bronchiectasis is sufficient to be considered. Because the expanded part forms a nest, which is enough to be a place for phlegm to stop. If the stopped phlegm is not well discharged, it will start to decay and cause fever and chills, and then waist and back pain, dizziness, and body twitching, various by-products of heat will be produced. Then, among the symptoms, there is vomiting; why? It is said that, strictly speaking, vomiting is the function of eliminating the contents of the stomach, and coughing and spitting is the function of eliminating the contents of the lungs and trachea. However, the ancients often said spitting for vomiting, not as strict as the current distinction. The "Golden Chamber" chapter on lung flaccidity, lung abscess, coughing, and shortness of breath says, "A rapid pulse at the cunkou indicates that the person coughs, and there is turbid saliva and mucus in the mouth." This saliva and mucus is called spitting. However, it also says, "Lung flaccidity, spitting saliva and mucus without coughing, the person is not thirsty and will definitely have urinary incontinence."</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Frequent urination," then saliva and mucus is also called vomiting. It also says, "Coughing and spitting pus and blood, a rapid and deficient pulse indicates lung flaccidity, a rapid and full pulse indicates lung abscess." This pus and blood from lung abscess is called spitting. However, it also says, "The disease is coughing and rebellious, the pulse is fine; how is it known that this is a lung abscess? There should be pus and blood, vomiting it will cause death." Then pus and blood from lung abscess is also called vomiting. It also says, "Accumulated abscess and pus, vomiting like rice porridge." This is also the pus of lung abscess being called a symptom of vomiting. Then the "coughing and vomiting" of latent drinking is "coughing and spitting." Why is it questioned that it is a disease of the lungs and trachea? However, the "Golden Mirror" says that it is the current asthma, which is not true, because asthma has no fever or chills.</p>
<h3>Q&amp;A on Common Medical Knowledge (8)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>Q: How is the onset period of tertian fever and quartan fever determined?</p>
<p>A: Tertian fever recurs after forty-eight hours; quartan fever recurs for the second time after seventy-two hours, and then it recurs repeatedly in this way. However, sometimes the next attack occurs one or two hours earlier than the scheduled time. There are also some that attack after twenty-four hours and become febrile every day, called repeated tertian fever or repeated quartan fever.</p>
<p>Q: Does malignant malaria occur in tropical areas? A: Malignant malaria originally occurred in tropical areas. However, in recent years, it has also been found occasionally near Shanghai, probably because people from Nanyang or other tropical areas brought it with them.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of malignant malaria?</p>
<p>A: When malignant malaria occurs, there is no violent tremor, only chills, and then the body temperature rises, and the fever lasts for about twenty-four hours to forty-eight hours. The attack recurs after an interval of several tens of hours. In addition to the rise in body temperature, there are also frequent pulse, somnolence, delirium, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, jaundice, creeping rash, etc.</p>
<p>Q: Is malaria chronic?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Chronic malaria is mostly transformed from malignant malaria. The fever pattern is very irregular. Because red blood cells are destroyed, there is severe anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and the skin appears yellowish. Then it later falls into cachexia (although there is no fever, nutrition is impaired, palpitation is enhanced, breathing is accelerated, chronic diarrhea, edema, bloody nose, subcutaneous hemorrhage, etc.).</p>
<p>Q: Are there other changes in malaria?</p>
<p>A: There is a type called masked malaria, which has no fever or a slight fever. There is no fixed interval, and other symptoms occur, such as neuralgia, heart pain, abdominal pain, occasional loss of consciousness, etc., but splenomegaly is common.</p>
<p>Q: Where is this masked malaria most common?</p>
<p>A: There are many warm places.</p>
<p>Q: How does malaria affect life?</p>
<p>A: Tertian fever and quartan fever are not dangerous; malignant fever is relatively dangerous.</p>
<p>Q: Is there a specific drug for treating malaria?</p>
<p>A: The specific drug for treating malaria is quinine (commonly known as cinchona bark) because it has the ability to kill malaria sporozoites in the blood.</p>
<p>Q: How is quinine taken?</p>
<p>A: Take half a gram of quinine hydrochloride three or four hours before the attack; if the fever stops, you must continue to take it for more than ten days, two or three times a day, each time 0.2 grams.</p>
<p>Q: Can quinine be injected directly into blood vessels?</p>
<p>A: In case of serious illness, it can be used to inject intravenously.</p>
<p>Q: What should be done if oral or injectable quinine is ineffective?</p>
<p>A: You can also take or inject arsenic agents at the same time, or inject salvarsan, or try a new preparation, quinoporphyromonoastral.</p>
<p>Q: How to prevent malaria?</p>
<p>A: The prevention of malaria lies in getting rid of malarial mosquitoes. Do not accumulate sewage near the home to prevent mosquito breeding. Use mosquito nets on beds and screens on windows to avoid mosquito bites.</p>
<h3>The Scientific Treatise on Health Preservation (16)</h3>
<p>— Yu Songjun</p>
<p>Statement of Changing the Compilation: Since the publication of this series, it has been praised by all walks of life through letters and telegrams, and I dare not fail to encourage myself. Originally, the entire manuscript was completed and about to be printed into a separate book. However, after checking the title "Scientific Treatise on Health Preservation," it is a kind of reading material for the new era to popularize the public, and the published chapters occasionally have the nature of lectures on obstetrics and midwifery, which seems not entirely suitable for popular reading. Therefore, it is re-edited in order to meet the needs of the public as the sole goal. In addition to the revised text of the previous sections, which will be printed separately and published in a separate book, the contents published in this newspaper afterwards will be continued in accordance with the re-edited version. I hope that those who are concerned about this series will understand.</p>
<p>(10) (3) General Postpartum Management</p>
<p>(A) Definition of the Puerperium</p>
<p>The period from childbirth to the restoration of the body to its original state due to the physical changes caused by pregnancy and childbirth is called the puerperium. This puerperium lasts an average of six weeks. Usually, the return of menstruation is considered the sign of the end of the puerperium. If the parturient woman goes through the normal process to reach the puerperium, it will naturally be smooth sailing and there is no need to worry too much. However, the physical changes caused by childbirth are not minor after all. If there is any carelessness, it will inevitably cause endless troubles. Therefore, the recuperation and health maintenance during the puerperium must also be paid attention to.</p>
<p>(B) Length of Bed Rest</p>
<p>At least one or two weeks of bed rest are required after childbirth. In the first few days, the supine position should be taken to prevent air from entering the uterus. Afterwards, if the uterine contraction is good and the lochia is normal, then you can lie on your side at will. Within a week, all feeding, breastfeeding, and excretion of urine and feces should be done in bed. If you get up too early, the uterus may not have contracted, the ligaments may not be firm, or there may be uterine inversion, prolapse, or bleeding. In short, the decision on when to get out of bed must be based on the state of uterine contraction and the quality of lochia. The meaning is that the lochia is thin and light, the uterus recovers, and until the pubic symphysis cannot be felt by palpation, only then can you get out of bed.</p>
<p>(C) Excretion of Lochia</p>
<p>What is lochia? It is a kind of fluid discharged from the reproductive organs during the puerperium. One or two days after childbirth, there is dark red lochia, which is bloody lochia. It flows out after the third day, gradually has serum, and appears light red, which is serous lochia. After the eighth day, the number of white blood cells in the mucus gradually increases, and it appears grayish white, which is white lochia. After the third week, what is excreted is only transparent, thin mucus, until the fourth week, the excretion is completely stopped. Generally speaking, lactating women have less lochia and a shorter time, while non-lactating women have more lochia and a longer time.</p>
<p>(D) Uterine Contraction</p>
<p>Afterpains are a cause of uterine contraction. The initial pain is stronger, and then it weakens, until the second or third day of the puerperium, it completely disappears, at most not more than five days. After childbirth is completed, the uterus begins to contract. The bottom of the uterus is about 11 cm below the umbilicus. After two or three hours, it gradually rises and reaches the navel. On the second and third days, it gradually descends to below the navel. On the fifth day to between the pubic symphysis and the navel, on the ninth and tenth days, it hides behind the pubic symphysis, and by the twelfth day, it completely enters the small pelvis. By the sixth week, it returns to its original state before pregnancy.</p>
<p>An abdominal binder can prevent relaxation of the abdominal wall and can promote uterine contraction. For easy use, you can place four or five layers of cotton wool on the abdominal wall, and then wrap and tie it with a soft cloth.</p>
<h3>Regarding Syphilis of the Lungs</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>Syphilis of the lungs occurs in the tertiary stage of syphilis. Previous generations considered it a rare manifestation of syphilis. In fact, if one pays attention to examination during clinical practice, one would be surprised at its frequency. Its symptoms are very similar to pulmonary tuberculosis. If doctors are not careful, they often misdiagnose it as pulmonary tuberculosis. Syphilis affecting the lungs is initially not obvious, with only symptoms such as coughing, chest tightness, and pain in the sternum. The patient's body gradually becomes weaker, and their appetite gradually decreases. Later, there will be blood in the sputum, in varying amounts, difficulty breathing, sometimes high fever, and sometimes only a slight fever. The sputum, in addition to blood, is mostly purulent. At this time, patients often think it is pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., tuberculosis) and seek medical attention. Doctors, hearing the symptoms described above, examining the lungs and finding bronchial breathing sounds or rales, and seeing cavities or infiltrative lesions on X-rays, often assume it is secondary or tertiary pulmonary tuberculosis without further thought. Therefore, they prescribe treatments such as sunlight therapy, sun lamp therapy, pneumothorax, nutritional therapy, medication, and climate therapy, and so on, without exception. However, the condition worsens day by day, even to the point of respiratory distress and death from excessive phlegm. People generally regret that they sought treatment too late to be saved. In fact, it is a wrongful death.</p>
<p>Diagnosis is quite difficult because the symptoms are similar to pulmonary tuberculosis. In addition to paying attention to the patient's past medical history, the examiner must also check for signs of syphilis. If the patient has a syphilitic ulcer-like sore throat, absent pupillary reflexes, absent knee-jerk reflexes, and other signs of syphilis, while also having the above-mentioned lung symptoms, then a Wassermann serological test for syphilis must be performed. If necessary, a Wassermann reaction test of the cerebrospinal fluid should be performed. Sometimes, the Wassermann serological test may be negative. In this case, 0.45 of Salvarsan 914 should be injected to stimulate it, and then blood should be drawn for testing. If it is syphilis, then it will definitely show a positive Wassermann reaction. Some people say that X-ray examination can diagnose syphilis of the lungs, but in reality, only experienced pulmonologists can distinguish it. Although syphilis of the lungs has a dense shadow on the X-ray film, appearing at the bifurcation of the trachea as a characteristic, the lesions are often also found at the apex of the lungs or below the clavicle. Sometimes, there are also atrophic streaks or cavities, which can easily be mistaken for pulmonary tuberculosis. In short, diagnosing syphilis of the lungs requires attention to whether the patient had the possibility of syphilis infection in the past, whether there are signs of syphilis in various parts of the body, and reference to the Wassermann reaction and the various current symptoms of the lungs. Then the diagnosis will not easily be mistaken. Sometimes, patients with true pulmonary tuberculosis may also be infected with syphilis at the same time. In this case, Salvarsan 914 can be injected to expel the syphilitic agent to observe the results. If the lung symptoms do not improve, and tubercle bacilli are found in the sputum, then it is known that the lung symptoms are caused by pulmonary tuberculosis, and not by syphilis. Some people who are well-informed are often secretive about past syphilis infections. In fact, if the syphilis affects the lungs, it will make diagnosis difficult for doctors, which can backfire. I hope that people in society will pay attention to this. (End)</p>
<h3>What the Public Should Know About "Sha Yao Shui" (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Mao Qikun</p>
<p>Constipation is certainly not an absolutely unimportant disease. Sometimes another disease can occur due to constipation; sometimes it is just a symptom of a certain disease. The former includes the inducement of "hemorrhoids," "chronic enteritis," and paralysis of the intestinal muscles due to constipation, resulting in "intestinal obstruction"...etc. Mild cases can lead to lifelong illness, while severe cases can endanger life. The latter includes constipation often occurring in those suffering from "typhoid fever"; or significant constipation due to visceral ptosis, weakened intestinal walls, retroverted uterus, rectal cancer, etc. There are also cases where the former becomes the cause and the latter the effect. Even doctors do not dare to act rashly when encountering these cases, and must conduct a detailed examination, but many ordinary people try medications themselves, which is a pity. One should know that constipation in summer is mostly caused by excessive sweating, lack of water in the intestines; or by indigestion; or by consuming raw and cold foods, causing intestinal inflammation, resulting in loss of defecation function; or by intestinal muscle hypersensitivity and increased peristalsis, which can sometimes also cause constipation. At the same time, one often feels dry mouth, sore throat, nausea, and headaches, and even cold limbs, numbness, and cramps. As a result, many mistakenly believe it to be "sha" and seek relief from Sha Yao Shui, just like the above example of seeking trouble for oneself. In order to help the reader understand, I have explained it in great detail. Now, let's get back to the main topic and describe other cases.</p>
<p>A woman had abdominal pain in the middle of the night, got up to go to the toilet, and had slight diarrhea. She took Sha Yao Shui and the pain subsided. However, she still felt abdominal distension and frequent urges to defecate, and could not fall asleep. Hearing that opium has the effect of relieving pain, reducing bloating, and inducing sleep, she sought it out, and it was indeed effective. The next day, she had a high fever and chills, and the abdominal pain was even more severe. At first, she was unwilling to seek medical attention, and still regarded Sha Yao Shui as a treasure. Gradually, she could not hold on and went to the hospital. Diagnosed as dysentery. Examination confirmed it.</p>
<p>The method of treating dysentery, whether new or old, must first be to promote bowel movements. The woman in question first used Sha Yao Shui, then opium. This is contrary to the standard treatment, and she almost put herself in a desperate situation. This is another example.</p>
<p>A child, just learning to speak, suddenly had diarrhea and vomiting. The family gave him Sha Yao Shui, and he fell asleep and never woke up. When he arrived at the hospital, his breathing was barely sustained. After examination, the symptoms of poisoning were quite obvious. When asked, they knew that he had been given Sha Yao Shui. Asked how much? They said: "Just a little bit." The bottle was taken out for examination, and the so-called "just a little bit" was almost half a bottle! Told that he had taken too much medicine, and it was difficult to save him. They were sadly about to cry, and felt lost. Still wondering, "How could such a small amount cause such a thing?"</p>
<p>People like that, as far as I have seen, are countless! The focus of their wrong concept is the phrase "medicine filling the intestines," which is harmful! In fact, these people have never thought that "a liter of rice cooked into rice and a liter of rice cooked into porridge," although the amount produced is different, the "rice" is still "one liter." "A bowl of thick porridge and a bowl of thin porridge," although it is the same "bowl," the amount of "rice" contained is definitely different. No wonder they use the concept of taking "old medicine" - decoctions, to take "new medicine" that has been "refined." I specifically emphasize this, hoping that readers pay attention! It is not only when taking "Sha Yao Shui" that one must be careful - all other "new medicines" cannot be increased or decreased at will. They must be used according to the standard method! Especially for "children," one should be even more cautious! So that I do not waste my breath.</p>
<p>Other cases, such as those that are definitely "cholera" or other diseases, and are "mistreated" due to blind faith in "Sha Yao Shui," resulting in the loss of a good treatment period, are even more common.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, having read my article to this point, you should be able to "clearly recognize what Sha Yao Shui is"! It may be used as a temporary emergency remedy, but it is a fallacy to regard it as a "miracle cure for all diseases"!</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have some hopes:</p>
<p>(1) Those responsible for managing the distribution of drugs should strictly ban the sale of non-standard preparations on the market, so as to avoid harm to society. Once a preparation has been inspected and deemed acceptable for distribution, they should be ordered to clearly publish the "prescription" for the preparation: what diseases it treats? What precautions should be taken when taking it? The dosage for each time, and the maximum limit; especially the standard for how much time should pass between consecutive doses, and not to exceed a certain limit, so that users do not "overdo things" and have something to follow.</p>
<p>(2) The preparations for Sha Yao Shui cannot be uniform. Each company's preparations have their own differences. The matters stated in (1) above are very important. General pharmacists should take this seriously, and those who call themselves "charitable" should also pay considerable attention to it. When encountering illiterate or ignorant people, they must explain it in detail to avoid misunderstandings, which is also a great merit!</p>

<h3>Month of Many Troubles</h3>
<p>— Ding Meng</p>
<p>At the end of last month, newspapers mostly said that May is a "month of many troubles." This term has not been seen before. Now this "month of many troubles" has arrived. Thinking back on the days that have passed, it is true that May 1st is "Labor Day," which can be said to have some "many troubles"; May 3rd is the anniversary of the Jinan Massacre, which is also certainly one of the "many troubles." But May 4th is the promotion of the New Culture Movement, and May 5th is the auspicious day of the establishment of the revolutionary government. Why are these included in the "trouble" pile? This is really a bit strange!</p>
<p>However, as long as this "trouble" is not interpreted as the "suffering" of the people, but as the "embarrassing" "trouble," then all difficulties can be easily resolved.</p>
<p>The times have really changed quickly. Ancient festivals have inevitably turned into difficult hurdles. Previous meetings were held in open spaces where the public could listen, but now one must guard against people "taking the opportunity to cause trouble," so representatives must be invited by letter to gather in Western-style buildings, and military police must maintain order. Previous dignitaries, although they came out to "clear the streets" (commonly known as "净街"), still walked on the ground, but now they must guard against people "plotting against them," and must travel by plane, and can only be safely sent to friends when going abroad. Celebrities strolling through antique shops was not considered a strange thing before, but now the "incognito" and "incognito" talk is deafening, so they can only climb famous mountains or enter ancient temples, which is relatively free from surprises. In short, the reliable pillars of the country are mostly in mid-air, or at least on high buildings and mountains. The landlords only keep some suspicious people, who are actually "lower people," and it is difficult to distinguish between the people and bandits. Whenever there are celebrations or funerals, there is always the risk of "disturbances under false pretenses." Although we have always relied on "strict prevention by both Chinese and foreign authorities," and there have been no major disturbances, it is always more laborious than usual, which is embarrassing, and May has become a "month of many troubles," regardless of whether the commemorations are good or bad, and whether the days are sad or happy.</p>
<p>I hope that major events in the world will not increase; I hope that there will be no more massacres in China; I hope that there will be no more government establishments; I hope that there will be no more birthdays and death anniversaries of great people. Otherwise, over time, it will soon become a "year of many troubles." Not only will the Chinese and foreign authorities always be embarrassed, but we small people walking on the ground will also have to always carry "suspicion" and accompany the martial law, alas! We can't breathe anymore.</p>
<h3>Let Me Also Talk About the National Character of China</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>Recently, I have carefully studied the so-called "national character" of China from a historical perspective. As a result, I cannot help but join the people who advocate "national rejuvenation" and shout "Great!"</p>
<p>According to my research, the national character of China is the most willing to sacrifice, the most considerate of the overall situation, and in short, the most "possessing the demeanor of a great nation." According to the logical methods of Chinese scholar-officials, as long as you point out a few people's "great achievements," you can cover up the national character of an era. Because these few people first "set an example" and "set a model," and according to the order of "rectifying the heart, cultivating the body, managing the family, governing the country, and pacifying the world," of course there will be no people with inferior character, as Dr. Hu Shi called them, in that era. Now, let me give two examples of figures who can represent the Chinese national character.</p>
<p>Those who "sacrifice the good name of national heroes" and those who voluntarily jump into the fire pit" are certainly the most willing to sacrifice. The person with such a "fearless spirit" in history is probably Qin Hui, "second to none." Because Qin Hui sacrificed the "good name of national heroes," his iron statue kneels in West Lake and is spat upon by thousands of people. In fact, he himself felt that he was "jumping into the fire pit" with his "painstaking efforts" and the courage to "overcome all difficulties." It is a pity that Hu Ye and the people of later generations have never been willing to forgive him!</p>
<p>The person who was most able to "consider the overall situation" in history was Wu Sangui! Think about it, at that time, a group of bandits led by Li Zicheng were rampant, "killing and setting fires." If they were allowed to mess around like that, would the Chinese nation still have a chance to survive? Because Mr. Wu wanted to preserve a glimmer of hope for the Chinese nation, he invited the Qing troops to enter the customs and "destroy this ugly class." Of course, the Qing troops killed and set fires far more than the bandits, but after all, the Qing Taizu was a "true son of heaven." After he burned and killed, he was able to lay the foundation for the Central Plains, and after hundreds of years, his descendants did not return a good nation to us? Therefore, Mr. Wu's calculations were really good! Who can say that Mr. Qin and Mr. Wu are ashamed of the title of "great citizen"?</p>
<p>Originally, the meaning of history changes with the times. Shang Yang and Wang Anshi were also raised up when Kang Liang advocated reform. In the current era, according to telegrams issued by some parties, the poison of the so-called "Red Bandits" is really no less than the bandits at the end of the Ming Dynasty, so some people advocate that even if we do not actively invite Japanese soldiers to come and help us "suppress the bandits," we might as well passively let them come in to consolidate our "rear defense." However, at this juncture, we ordinary people should think about whether the people at the end of the Ming Dynasty should help Li Zicheng fight Wu Sangui, or should help Wu Sangui fight Li Zicheng?</p>
<h3>One Day</h3>
<p>— Lin Weiyin</p>
<p>In the showcase, the car, day after day from morning to night, from night to morning, looked at the many other cars on the street outside the window speeding by, walking slowly: there were masters, madams, misses, grandfathers, and sometimes dogs in the cars, all of them were very cute. He especially liked the dogs, squatting there seemingly despising everything, gazing forward seemingly without purpose, as if even the masters beside them were not in their eyes. He did not know where they had gone to pick up these people or dogs, and where they were rushing to with these people or dogs. He really envied them, running so freely. He furtively looked at the two cars parked on his left and right, also drooping their heads and losing their spirits like him.</p>
<p>One day, luck came to him, and he happily got a master to drive him and rescued him from the prison-like showcase. Everything was new to him, he was happy, he was grateful to his master. He drove very loyally for his master, and sometimes when the road was short, he felt a little sorry, as if the master was too considerate of him. Just now he drove past the showcase he had lived in for a long time and saw his two companions were still there, only their positions had moved slightly. He sympathized with them, why haven't they gone out to see the world yet at this time. Distracted, he forgot to greet them, not even nodding his head slightly, as if he did not know them, or as if he knew them but did not see them. He felt that they were looking at him with regret. He was too hasty, he was reproaching himself in regret. He hoped to pass by there again soon and ask them to forgive him for this oversight.</p>
<p>However, he did not know when, he had lost that joy of running. He also felt that his master was too inconsiderate of him. Having just run from a gathering into the garage, before he could rest for long, he had to send the young master to school. He was also often rained on, and although it was spring, it was still a bit cold. And what's the point of running like this? Could this be the end? This is even more than before丨No, he didn't want to go back to the showcase, he had tasted that kind of taste enough. He thought丨What did he think? He thought he was a little afraid to say it, to crash into some car coming from the opposite direction. Once, he saw a car coming from the front, very beautiful, and the people in the car did not seem to disgust him, so he lowered his head, calmed his heart, and charged straight ahead, half in fear and half in hope; but, somehow, he did not crash into it. He was disappointed, he complained to the car owner.</p>
<p>Now, crashing into an oncoming car can be said to be his only hope.</p>
<h3>The Sorrow of Returning from Abroad</h3>
<p>— Da Wu</p>
<p>A friend who returned from living abroad for more than ten years has been coming to me frequently lately to complain that he is not used to life in China. For example, when defecating, he can't squat on a toilet, and he can't find a clean public toilet anywhere in Shanghai. Upon arriving in Shanghai, he couldn't defecate for a week at first. Later, he learned to squat on the toilet, but he could only defecate once every three days, really like being on the guillotine and in a pot of boiling oil, quite unable to endure the torment.</p>
<p>So I told him that this was because he was not used to it. But if you have money, Shanghai can still be comfortable, but it's not as cheap as abroad: workers can take cars to work and defecate using flushing toilets. Because "China is a suffering China, and the Chinese people are suffering Chinese people," using the large to illustrate the small, such as national crises, we "must arrange to suffer," don't shout, maybe the national crisis can be saved, one shout, "there is the danger of national demise," so if you can't defecate, the first thing is to "be silent," otherwise maybe you will be "not allowed to defecate, violators will be arrested."</p>
<p>That friend also complained to me about various other hardships: getting on the tram you have to scramble, buying things you have to haggle over the price, otherwise you often suffer losses. For example: one day, going to the post office to send a registered letter, because according to foreign customs, he waited in line, but others rushed ahead of him, and as a result he waited a full hour to send the letter; another day, taking a rickshaw, he was pulled halfway, put down, and asked for more money, ... and so on.</p>
<p>I said that there is no way to do this, wait until you get used to it, and naturally there will be no difficulties. Even if people from all walks of life in politics, academia, and business select a hundred words from the "dictionary of morality" and call on people to regard them as creeds, "maintain morality, and restore people's hearts," there is no way. If the people who go to buy stamps with you also have the opportunity to live abroad for more than ten years, and the rickshaw pullers also have the money to take cars, China would have already changed from "suffering" to "good fortune," why bother with resisting and negotiating at the same time? So now "suffering is destined," you have to arrange to suffer, don't complain.</p>
<p>That friend shook his head, and left sadly.</p>
<h3>Carrot Hair</h3>
<p>— julesrenard, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>A Lock of Hair</p>
<p>On Sundays, the family of Le Pichon forced her two children to go to Mass. They were dressed up beautifully; Miss Elestine, risking that she wouldn't have enough time to dress up herself, personally took charge of their attire. She chose ties for them, trimmed their fingernails, and handed out prayer books. 丨She gave the thickest one to Carrot Hair. But the most important thing was to rub hair growth oil on her brothers.</p>
<p>She really had a kind of craze for this.</p>
<p>Although Carrot Hair followed her instructions without saying anything different, his older brother Felix warned his younger sister that he would get angry if she did it again. Therefore, she deceived him:</p>
<p>"This time I forgot," she said, "I didn't mean to do it, I swear to you: from next week, I won't put hair growth oil on you anymore."</p>
<p>But she always tried to find ways to put a little bit on him.</p>
<p>"One day this will cause trouble," his older brother Felix said.</p>
<p>This morning, because he was bowing his head to wipe his face, Miss Elestine was able to play tricks again, but he didn't notice it at all. "Look, I'm listening to you now," she said, "you won't grumble anymore, you see the jar of hair oil is tightly covered and placed on the mantelpiece. Aren't I good? Actually, I didn't do much work. Carrot Hair's hair needs cement to stick, but for you, hair growth oil is completely useless. Your hair naturally curls and is fluffy. Your head is like a head of cauliflower, and this pattern can last until the evening without getting messed up."</p>
<p>"I owe you one," his older brother Felix said.</p>
<p>He stood up without suspicion. He forgot to touch his head as usual to try.</p>
<p>Miss Elestine dressed him, decorated him, and gave him a pair of white silk gloves.</p>
<p>"Alright?" his older brother Felix said.</p>
<p>"You're as handsome as a prince," Miss Elestine said, "Now you only lack a hat. Go get it yourself from the wardrobe."</p>
<p>But his older brother Felix made a mistake. He looked at himself in the door of the cabinet. He rushed to the cupboard, opened it, grabbed a glass bottle filled with water from the dining table, and calmly poured it on his head.</p>
<p>"I warned you a long time ago, my sister," he said. "I don't like people making fun of me. You're only this little, not enough to deceive an experienced old man. If you do this again, I'll jump into the river to wash off your hair growth oil." His hair was flattened, his beautiful Sunday clothes were all wet, and he waited for others to change him or let the sun dry them, whatever was fine, it was the same to him.</p>
<p>"What a powerful person!" Carrot Hair thought, he was completely stunned with admiration. "He's not afraid of anyone, if I did as he did, it would definitely make people laugh. It's better to let them think that I don't hate hair growth oil."</p>
<p>But as Carrot Hair patiently endured with a accustomed mind, his hair was secretly taking revenge for him. Those hairs that had been pressed down with force, temporarily seemed dead under the pressure of the hair growth oil; then they gradually revived, and due to an invisible impetus, they created a thin and shiny relief, and they cracked open this relief and dug down. It was exactly like a thatched house covered in ice that was melting.</p>
<p>In just a moment, that first lock of hair stood straight, unconstrained, and independent in the air.</p>

<h3>The Ominous Signs of Shanghai's Financial Market by Wei Youfei</h3>
<p>The ominous signs of Shanghai's financial market, as discussed in this article, are in fact general ominous signs for the entire nation. The most prominent symptoms are (1) financial stagnation and (2) outflow of funds.</p>
<p>In the first quarter (January to March) of this year, the silver dollar movement in Shanghai indicates a gradual increase. The following is a statistical table: (Unit: ten thousand yuan)</p>
<p>(Inflow)</p>
<p>Hankou 495, Chongqing 499, Jiujiang 198, Yichang 36</p>
<p>Nantong 192, Tianjin 30, Wenzhou 190, Zhenjiang 21</p>
<p>New silver dollars 186, Changsha 20, Qingdao 185, Bengbu 25</p>
<p>Xiamen 141, Luoyang 20, Xuzhou 100, Anqing 10</p>
<p>Wuhu 87, Niuzhuang 10, Hangzhou 85</p>
<p>(Outflow)</p>
<p>Dalian 150, Tianjin 100, Qinhuangdao 20</p>
<p>Hangzhou 40, Zhifu 20</p>
<p>The total inflow is 20.8 million yuan, and the total outflow is 3.3 million yuan, forming a ratio of 6.3 to 1. Why are silver dollars from the inland areas being transported to Shanghai? There are only three possible reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The Bankruptcy of the Rural Economy: The silk cocoon season each year is a prosperous season for the financial sector because the use of silver dollars is greatest at that time. Interest rates can rise, and banks and money shops can take the opportunity to make transactions. In recent years, the silk cocoon market has collapsed. The areas along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo railways can be said to be in need of financial assistance everywhere, while, in the financial sector, there is nowhere to lend. Why are the two sides in such opposite situations? In the inland areas, people rely almost entirely on agricultural crops and by-products as capital. The poor condition of agricultural products has caused farmers, workers, and merchants to come to a standstill. Do they not need financial assistance? In the financial sector, the reason for sending funds to the inland areas has always been to use agricultural crops as a form of collateral. Now, there is no basis for relying on agricultural crops. For the sake of the safety of lending, will they stop moving forward? Because of these two relationships, the loans that have already been issued must be recovered when they are due, and the loans that are prepared to be issued will not be issued. Therefore, the silver dollars in Shanghai can only increase, with no way out.</p>
<p>(2) Imbalance in International Trade Balance: This reason is also based on the first reason. The years of floods, the disturbances by the communists, and the drop in prices of agricultural crops have caused the bankruptcy of the rural economy. The purchasing power of farmers has been greatly weakened and they have become more frugal, but daily necessities, such as kerosene, foreign cloth, and piece goods, still have to rely on foreign countries. In normal years, naturally more foreign goods are imported, but the export of local goods can also offset some of it. This year, it is impossible. There are only goods going to the inland areas, and no goods coming out from the inland areas. Therefore, silver dollars can only be transported to Shanghai to buy imported goods, increasing batch by batch.</p>
<p>(3) Panic in the Minds of Inland Depositors: This is a special situation. Inland depositors usually trust Shanghai's financial institutions. Even during the Shanghai War, the deposits in Shanghai did not waver because of the insecurity in the inland areas. Based on the above-mentioned psychology, depositors transport their money to Shanghai for storage, which is also one of the reasons for the increase.</p>
<p>As such, the situation in the inland areas is that they need financial assistance, but on the one hand, funds are only flowing to Shanghai. As for Shanghai, there is also no way to make the funds active, and there are only two ways to go: one is to speculate, and the other is to flow abroad. Shanghai can only speculate on the increase in the amount of silver dollars and the stagnation of the way out. The most obvious is to do real estate transactions; the soaring prices of real estate in recent years are the result of these stagnant funds, a kind of floating growth. No matter what kind of transaction, its price will often exceed its true situation, whether it goes up or down. The same is true of real estate, only it is too active and too prosperous. Those who bought in large quantities at that time all found it difficult to sell. Those who have already bought but cannot sell them have no choice but to seek rental income from construction, because they cannot watch a piece of empty land generate interest. According to the report of the local real estate company, real estate transactions did not flourish in the first quarter, while the construction industry gradually improved. This is due to the reason that it is difficult to sell at the moment.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a method especially used in the construction industry. For example, a real estate merchant can first mortgage the land to the financial sector to borrow funds as construction capital, and after the construction is completed, he can mortgage the houses again to borrow funds as working capital. Therefore, the construction business is also false. The rental of buildings only goes up, while the vitality of life does not increase, and livelihood becomes more difficult.</p>
<p>This situation is naturally not a good current situation. Using speculation to replace investment is to treat capital as leisure, and the financial sector's mortgage of a large amount of real estate will cause the disadvantage of making financial turnover inflexible in the event of panic. The cause of the financial panic in the United States this year was a bank run. The reason for the bank run was the lack of funds, and the fact that American banks undertook a large amount of real estate mortgage due to the result of industrial bankruptcy was also one of the reasons for the inflexibility of turnover. The rise of other speculative markets is also based on the reason of financial stagnation, and real estate is only one of them.</p>
<p>There is an endless way for Shanghai to deposit funds, and that is to flow abroad. This is entirely due to the reason of the international trade deficit. According to the statistics of the Shanghai agency that handles the collection and disbursement of Chinese and foreign banks, the deposits of Chinese merchants are decreasing every day, and the amount of money transferred to foreign banks is increasing every day. Therefore, the formula for the financial situation is that rural areas flow to trading ports, and trading ports flow to foreign countries. Is this not an ominous sign of the financial sector? Is this not a fatal injury to the national economy?</p>
<p>Countermeasures Against Dumping of Foreign Goods</p>
<p>by Wang Fengxin</p>
<p>The relationship between the dumping of foreign goods and the national production and consumption economy of our country has been detailed in my book "Dumping of Foreign Goods and the National Economy" (see this journal on April 17). Now, please allow me to discuss the countermeasures against the dumping of foreign goods as follows:</p>
<p>The markets of our country have always been the final destination for goods from various countries. In recent years, economic panic has occurred in various countries, and the sales of goods have been increasing day by day. International commercial competition has been intensifying. All measures, such as the increase of tariffs, the abandonment of the gold standard, and the dumping of goods abroad, are all strong armor and sharp weapons in the economic wars of various countries. Our country has been in civil war for years, and the people have not been able to live together. Recently, foreign aggression has come one after another, and the national situation is in danger. Under these circumstances, the national industry of our country, which has a weak foundation, is like a person with a chronic disease, and even if it does not suffer any blows, it will not be able to survive until the evening. Now, foreign goods have become more intensified, using their devalued currency and their strong strength, regardless of cost, to dump in our country, which is tantamount to being beaten up. There are few who will not fall and die. The seriousness of the dumping of foreign goods and its harm to the national economy of our country are like this. If our country is willing to listen to fate and sit and wait for death, then so be it. If not, we must carefully plan coping methods within the possible scope. Although we cannot completely resist the dumping of foreign goods, we can at least suppress the degree of their dumping. The detailed methods can be discussed from three aspects: the government, the society, and the national industry itself.</p>
<p>First, from the government's point of view, the first is to promptly implement the anti-dumping tax law. The anti-dumping tax law of our country has been promulgated, and the anti-dumping review committee has also been formed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. We deeply hope that the government will enforce the law and implement it earnestly so that foreign goods will have to pay more taxes and have heavier costs, and cannot be dumped without limit. At the same time, the national industry of our country can also rely on it to have a glimmer of life. However, there are several points that we must pay attention to here: (1) ANTI-DUMPING LEGISLATION has two types: mandatory and discretionary. Discretionary anti-dumping legislation is more flexible in execution, while mandatory anti-dumping legislation is more rigid. Which of the two is more suitable for the anti-dumping legislation of our country must be determined after weighing the situation and considering the reasons. However, since the purpose of the anti-dumping legislation of our country is to resist the dumping of various foreign goods, it seems that flexibility is more suitable. Moreover, rigid anti-dumping legislation involves complicated procedures and high costs. Therefore, from an economic point of view, flexibility is a better choice. (2) Anti-dumping legislation is nothing more than stipulating that foreign goods that are dumped should be subject to a special tax. However, it is a question as to what kind of tax rate is more suitable. The more reasonable approach is that the stipulated anti-dumping tax is equal to the difference between the domestic market price and the export value of the dumped foreign goods, so that its selling price after taxation is close to the domestic selling price, and our national goods will not be greatly affected. (3) Foreign goods manufacturers are not all in their home countries. There are not a few who set up factories in our country to manufacture. Under this special circumstance, if our country's anti-dumping legislation only stipulates that foreign goods imported from various home countries are taxed, while ignoring the dumped foreign goods manufactured in our country, it is also not a good plan. Therefore, whether foreign goods are dumped in our country or manufactured in their home countries, they must be subject to anti-dumping tax. Furthermore, the government's implementation of anti-dumping tax is only a temporary solution. Therefore, the second is to effectively protect the national industry. The government's protection of the national industry is only seen in rhetoric, and has not been proven by facts. Moreover, to give examples of facts, it is precisely the opposite of protection. In terms of donations and taxes, there has been no preferential treatment for the national industry; in terms of transportation, transportation agencies have also never given the national industry any convenience; recently, the reduction of work in yarn factories has many reasons, but according to people in the bureau, the unfavorable nature of the consolidated tax to Chinese yarn factories and the excessively high railway freight are also important reasons. At the present time, if our country wants to deal with the dumping of foreign goods, it should vigorously implement the anti-dumping tax law in a passive way; and in an active way, it should effectively protect the national industry to increase its strength to resist the dumping of foreign goods.</p>
<p>Secondly, from the social point of view, the first is that financial institutions should assist the national industry. The weak foundation of the national industry in our country is very obvious. All those who are in the position of financial institutions should provide material assistance to the extent possible. Reading the recent reports of the Bank of China and the Shanghai Bank, we learned that the two banks have provided a large amount of loans to the national industry. However, from the perspective of the entire national industry, it is still a drop in the bucket. It is hoped that all financial institutions will consider the difficulties and dangers of the national industry and provide more assistance, then will it not be of great benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood? The second is that the people should develop the habit of purchasing and using national goods. In recent times, the people of our country have admired extravagance and luxury, and like to use foreign goods, while despising national products, which also gives foreign goods a good opportunity to dump. It is hoped that the people of our country will be greatly enlightened, cultivate the habit of purchasing and using national goods, and not focus on the cheapness and good quality of foreign goods, then it is obvious to all that it is sufficient to passively resist the dumping of foreign goods.</p>
<p>Finally, from the perspective of the national industry itself, the first is to improve internal management, the second is to reduce the cost of goods, and the third is to improve the quality of goods. Although these three points are humble and not worth mentioning, if the national industry of our country can dispel suspicions and unite as one, create a national capital group, and devote itself to the improvement of management and manufacturing, then it can increase its strength and thicken its foundation in tangible and intangible ways. Therefore, the dumping of foreign goods can be dealt with calmly, and efforts can be made to compete, so that it will never be as helpless and waiting for death as it is today.</p>
<p>The rural economy of our country has declared bankruptcy. Now, the only thing that the domestic economic circles can rely on to survive is the general emerging national industry. If this only surviving national industry is also hit by the dumping of foreign goods, and it collapses, it will be seen that the national economy of our country will enter a state of collapse. Thinking of this, I cannot help but shudder, and I deeply hope that the government, the people, and the national industry will rise up and plan for it urgently.</p>
<p>What is Production? By Tang Qingzeng</p>
<p>What is production? It means creating or increasing the utility of wealth. Natural objects such as water, fire, wood, and stone all have limited utility, and they must be transformed by labor to meet the needs of human desires. Therefore, the more prosperous production is, the more wealth increases, and the more wealth there is, the more opportunities there are to satisfy desires. Human happiness is therefore enhanced. However, production is not the work of a special class in the country. It must be undertaken jointly by all the people of the country, either engaging in agricultural and industrial production, or engaging in commercial operations, or engaging in academic and artistic research. Division of labor and cooperation are all production.</p>
<p>In our daily lives, there are acts of consumption everywhere, such as eating, drinking, and living. Since there is consumption, we must find ways to produce to fill it. If we only know how to consume and do not engage in production, then when consumption is exhausted, life will not be satisfied. How much an individual contributes to society depends on the size of his productive power. The amount remaining after subtracting what he consumes from what he produces is his social evaluation. If production is more than consumption, his individual value must be high; otherwise, it is low. Let us express it in a formula as follows: Individual value = production - consumption</p>
<p>Most people in our country today are indulged in comfort and rarely engage in production. There are more consumers and fewer producers in society, so the result is a phenomenon of insufficiency, which is the root cause of national poverty. It can also be expressed in a formula as follows: Production (less) - Consumption (more) = Insufficiency</p>
<p>The importance of production is as described above. As for its own nature, it can be divided into two categories: one is material production, which is tangible, such as agricultural and industrial production, or changing the nature of wealth, or changing the form of wealth, so as to create and increase its utility and increase its value; the other is non-material production, which is formed by the service of all the people in society. Everyone must do their best and strive to serve society in order to become a useful person in society. Although this kind of production is intangible, it is also quite important.</p>
<p>The purpose of production has two kinds: individual and social: the former is to satisfy one's own desires, such as seeking personal food and clothing, and the development and success of one's career, etc. If one does not engage in production, one cannot obtain social remuneration, and one's personal desires cannot be satisfied; the latter is to seek happiness for the people, which is more important than the former, because man is a social animal and cannot be independent from the group. Therefore, in addition to one's own family, one should also consider the interests of the country and the happiness of the general society. The country and society are developing day by day with the evolution of human desires. If personal desires conflict with social desires, and it is difficult to satisfy both at the same time, then personal desires should be sacrificed, and then social desires can be satisfied, and the development of society has the hope of being complete.</p>
<p>The implementation of production should first have the elements of production. The elements of production are those that participate in production to be used and constitute the result of production. Scholars usually regard capital, labor, and land as the elements of production.</p>
<p>Capital is the most important for production today. The application of machinery and the expansion of enterprises cannot be done without capital. The prosperity and decline of all production depend on the presence or absence of capital. With capital, any enterprise can be operated; without capital, any production cannot be engaged in. Those with large capital are strong, and those with small capital are weak.</p>
<p>Labor is also an indispensable element of production, because the utility of all natural products is difficult to satisfy human desires. Labor must be added to increase its utility. For example, the ancients felt that it was not enough to eat raw meat and drink blood and live in caves, so they created cooked food and built palaces. All the progress of our clothing, food, housing, and transportation today is the result of the efforts of our predecessors.</p>
<p>Land is a gift of nature and has natural productive capacity. All animals and plants rely on it to reproduce. Under the stratum, there are also deposits of coal, iron, and other minerals. This is not only an indispensable element for production, but also an indispensable element for the national economy. Since the relationship between capital, labor, and land is so important to production, we should use them sparingly so as not to be in short supply. However, the people of our country have become accustomed to wasting the elements of production. In terms of capital, our country has always been called poor and lacks capital, but those who own a little property do not know how to use capital to engage in legitimate production. Some like to speculate, others are addicted to gambling. Those who are better off only deposit their funds in foreign banks, allowing the rights and interests to flow abroad and the capital to be depleted, while legitimate production has no way to obtain capital, resulting in no opportunity for development. Is it not regrettable?</p>
<p>The people of our country also waste labor. Looking at the reasons, it may be because the sanitary facilities are not adequate, which affects the health of workers and reduces their ability to work; or because workers lack education and knowledge, they often break the law and are imprisoned and unable to work; or because of poor management methods, or creating opportunities for workers to be lazy, or even indulging in romance, and the work performance will inevitably be reduced; in addition, there is a dangerous phenomenon, that is, since recent years, the rural economy of our country has gradually declined, and the emerging industries in the cities have not yet developed. During this transition period, the supply of workers exceeds the demand, and there are unemployed people everywhere. Those who have labor have no opportunity to use it. This kind of loss has a great impact on the national economy and can shake society.</p>
<p>Our country or people are even more uneconomical in the use of land. They do not know how to cultivate wasteland or improve cultivated land. Looking at the Northwest Plain, the fertile fields are thousands of miles wide, and the deposits are endless. Because of the inconvenient transportation and the sparse population, it is left to lie barren and no one cultivates it. In the southeast, which has always been known as a prosperous area for agriculture, the land is limited. If the cultivated land is not improved, there is no hope for increased production. Moreover, the rivers are not dredged, the lakes are silted up, and there are floods year after year, which greatly reduces agricultural production. Therefore, a country that is based on agriculture must rely on foreigners for its daily food needs.</p>
<p>Then how will we make modern youth become healthy producers in the future? What attitude should we take towards the various elements of production?</p>
<p>A healthy producer must have sufficient knowledge, a strong physique, and good morals. If he does not have sufficient knowledge, he does not know how to produce effectively; if he does not have a strong physique, he has no ability to engage in production at all; but if he has sufficient knowledge and a strong physique, but lacks good morals, then his knowledge and physical strength, if used improperly, will consume more than they produce. What good is he to the country? This kind of qualification of a healthy producer must be cultivated in youth, so that when he grows up, he can serve society more and produce more for society.</p>
<p>Moreover, in view of all the mistakes of the past, we should take the following attitude towards the elements of production in the future:</p>
<p>(1) With regard to capital, we should start with thrift to avoid waste. When using capital, we should be particularly cautious and first ask ourselves: Can this investment really produce? Is it beneficial to society and the country? If it can produce and is beneficial to society and the country, then even if there is sacrifice, it is worth it. Otherwise, even the slightest amount should be cherished.</p>
<p>(2) With regard to labor, in addition to mental labor, we should also pay attention to physical labor and practice it to correct the Chinese misconception of valuing mental labor over physical labor, because mental labor and physical labor are both labor and are equally important to production. There should be no difference between them.</p>
<p>(3) With regard to land, we should study the phenomena of nature in order to conquer them. The more we understand the phenomena of nature, the more we can utilize them. The gifts of nature are endless, and it depends on whether we can conquer them and utilize them.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on the Classification Method of Factors of Production: Farming</h3>
<p>The classification method of factors of production occupies a very important position in both production and distribution. Because in the means of production, it can indicate the function of a certain factor; in distribution, it can determine the compensation that a certain factor should receive. Therefore, we feel that it is necessary to clarify and discuss its classification method.</p>
<p>The content of the classification of factors of production has been gradually enriched, and it has not been achieved overnight. It has undergone years of evolution in history to reach the current stage. We can observe its advancement from two aspects.</p>
<p>First, looking at it from the traditional aspect, it can be divided into three steps:</p>
<p>(1) Land: Mercantilism regarded gold and silver as the wealth of a country, and when physiocracy arose, it completely opposed this view, regarding land as the only thing that can be produced. Only land can obtain a large amount of net surplus with a small cost, which is the so-called NET PRODUCT. Other industries such as industry and commerce only change the form or location of things, and cannot produce anything. Therefore, economists at that time, such as BOISGUILLBERT, VAUBAN, CANTILLON (the pioneers of the physiocratic school), MIRABEAU, QUESNAY (the masters of the physiocratic school), all regarded land as the only factor of production.</p>
<p>(2) Labor: Later, with Adam Smith, a step forward was taken, recognizing that the exchange value of all commodities is estimated based on the amount of labor required to manufacture them. Therefore, labor is indeed a source of wealth for a country. However, he still believed that nature (i.e., land) had a very important position in the production process. Ricardo and Marx supported his theory.</p>
<p>(3) Capital: Before the Industrial Revolution, household crafts were maintained, and the relationship between production and consumption was direct. However, after the Industrial Revolution, large-scale production was implemented, and the establishment of the factory system required a large number of machines and magnificent factory buildings. Therefore, in this environment, capital inevitably became one of the factors of production. In 1836, SENIOR determined the position of capital in production. His classification method was as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Basic factors</p>
<p>(1) Land</p>
<p>(2) Labor</p>
<p>(2) Subordinate factors | Capital</p>
<p>The factors in the traditional classification method are all subject to the restriction of a law. For example, land is subject to the law of diminishing returns, and labor is subject to the law of population. Capital is governed by the law of diminishing profits and the abstinence theory. Due to space constraints, detailed theories about these laws cannot be discussed here.</p>
<p>The second classification method is based on function:</p>
<p>(1) Working: That is, the contribution of labor to production. Its development has been discussed before, and the compensation it receives is wages.</p>
<p>(2) Waiting: That is, the contribution of capitalists to production. They can sacrifice present enjoyment to invest capital in production and wait for future gains, which is the so-called interest.</p>
<p>(3) Management or Risk-Taking: This refers to the contribution of entrepreneurs to production. They can direct the distribution and progress of production. At the same time, they also have to guess the market situation to determine the types of production. This point includes the nature of risk-taking. If the observation is accurate, PROFIT can be obtained, but if things do not go as desired, LOSS will inevitably be suffered. The above briefly describes the types of classification methods. In modern times, in addition to the above points, there has been no increase or decrease in the classification methods. Taking Marshall as an example, his classification method can be represented by the following diagram:</p>
<p>Factors of Production (Nature...Land Capital...Capital Human...Labor) Management or Organization Combining all of the above, the content of the classification method that has developed to the present day, and that is generally recognized by everyone, includes four items: land, capital, labor, and management. Some contemporary opinions believe that the state should also be regarded as one of the factors of production. The meaning of this can be summarized into three points:</p>
<p>(1) The influence of the political environment on production: The political environment is order and security. If there are tangible factors of production, but there is a lack of order and security, production cannot develop.</p>
<p>(2) The influence of the social environment on production: The social environment, that is, the social organization, also has a great relationship with production.</p>
<p>(3) The taxes levied by the state are the compensation it should receive for participating in production activities.</p>
<p>From the above theory, we can analyze:</p>
<p>(1) Has the state been recognized as a factor of production in production? Historically, no one has directly regarded the state as one of the factors of production. At most, it is only recognized that the state has a great help to production. The lack of it does not necessarily mean that production will stop as if there is a lack of labor or capital, but only reduces its production volume. This is proven by the theories of List, Raymond, etc. Even in China's current situation where order and stability cannot be maintained, can it be said that China has no production at all?</p>
<p>(2) Does the state directly affect production? The main components of the production process are labor and materials, that is, labor changes the form of materials, and the effectiveness of the state is negative. That is, production can develop with the improvement of national politics, but it does not mean that the state can directly affect production. Regarding this point, there have been many disputes throughout history. One faction believes that the state can not only not help production, but can also harm it. The state is completely a waste. Adam Smith advocated this view. And the other faction believes that the state is productive, and can be divided into several small factions.</p>
<p>(A) The theory of productivity: advocated by List, which means that although the state cannot directly generate value, it can generate a kind of productivity to assist production.</p>
<p>(B) The theory of capitalists' production: advocated by Karl Dietzel, believes that the state promotes production in the form of intangible capital, but the value of the state's intangible capital cannot be estimated.</p>
<p>(C) The theory of re-productivity: advocated by L. V. Stein. That is, the effectiveness of the state can become the capital of individuals and be expressed, that is, the re-production of the national economy, but we cannot determine what percentage of individual capital this capital occupies, so it is not useful.</p>
<p>(D) The new production theory: advocated by Wagner and others, which means that the country can create intangible wealth to assist production.</p>
<p>In summary, each of the above theories has its flaws. In comparison, the new production theory is more credible. However, the relationship between the state and production that he discusses is still in an indirect rather than a direct position.</p>
<p>(3) Is the state a purely economic organization? The functions of the state are complex rather than purely economic, so its organization also suits various needs, and production only occupies a part of it. This proves that the state is not a purely economic organization like factories and companies, and cannot become an independent factor of production.</p>
<p>(4) The effectiveness of the state is difficult to estimate: The functions of each factor in production can be estimated, so the respective compensation they should receive can be determined during distribution. But since the functions of the state are multifaceted, how do we estimate how much contribution it makes to production? If it cannot be estimated, then how is its compensation determined? In fact, all these facts clearly tell us that the state is not a factor of production. As for thinking that taxes are the compensation the state receives for production, it is not entirely true. One is because taxes are compulsory, while other factors of production receive their compensation under conditions of free competition. The other is because the amount of taxes collected may not be commensurate with its effectiveness, and furthermore, the use of taxes is not entirely for production, but also extends to other charitable, improvement, and enjoyment undertakings, so how can we distinguish them?</p>
<p>In short, up to now, no one has, and cannot, regard the state as one of the factors of production. As for what will happen in the future, we cannot determine now. Perhaps when the social system changes and the functions of the state evolve accordingly, the theory may become a reality.</p>

<p>Securities: The Bond Market Last Week Was Named a Stagnant Week</p>
<p>The More Absence of Trading, the More It Lingered</p>
<p>The More It Lingered, the More Absence of Trading</p>
<p>Last week, from May 1st to 6th, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange experienced an unusually stable market, which can be described as a stagnant week. After a slight increase in price one day, there was bound to be a decline the next day. The range of change was extremely narrow, and trading also decreased sharply as a result. This phenomenon often occurs in the first week after settlement. Because futures are full of expectations, both bulls and bears have their own reasons and watch each other. The more absence of trading, the more it lingers; the more it lingers, the more absence of trading. In fact, it is because the environmental situation is dull. There is no change in the Northeast war. Apart from a few retail investors and floor brokers acting as agents, customer trading is very limited. The total turnover for the entire week was only 31.3002 million yuan, of which spot transactions accounted for 22,000 yuan. Futures salt tax accounted for 7.265 million yuan, disarmament accounted for 5.83 million yuan, unified tax accounted for 5.25 million yuan, and the 1921 customs bonds accounted for 5.12 million yuan. The 20-volume and 20-customs bonds accounted for 6.235 million yuan, and the rest ranged from 100,000 to 560,000 yuan. Although the transactions were clear, the June contracts were fully opened on Monday. The daily progress was as follows: the diplomatic atmosphere was good on Monday, and the prices rose by 3.5 to 7.8 jiao; on Tuesday, the prices fell back by 6.7 jiao due to the tension in Zhangjiakou; on Wednesday, the atmosphere of recovering Doron was slightly better, and the prices rose again by 2.5 jiao; on Thursday, the prices fell again by 6.7 jiao due to the increasing tension in Luandong; on Friday, the prices rose slightly by 3.5 jiao; on Saturday, the prices continued to rise by 1.2 jiao. Looking at the overall progress, it was extremely stagnant. However, after lingering for many days and accumulating momentum for a long time, there should be a change soon. As a result, the prices rose by 1.2 to 6.7 jiao, etc.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn: American Cotton Continues to Rise Due to Short Covering</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially rose due to good news from Liverpool, and then fell back due to long liquidation. Finally, it rebounded strongly due to short covering. As a result, spot prices rose by 5 British pounds per ton, and futures prices rose by 1 to 7 British pounds per ton. In the Liverpool cotton market, spot prices rose by 10 points, and futures prices rose by 16 to 17 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. The Bombay market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 6th):</p>

<p>Silk and Tea: Wuyuan Northeastern First-Flush Tea Scheduled to Open</p>
<p>Because there is an added leap month of May this year, the season is late and the weather is still delaying the development of the tea sprouts in Wuyuan. However, the mountain households, recognizing that foreign firms are not interested in purchasing this year, and the firms are bound to choose severely and lower the prices, are picking and processing the early tea leaves as soon as the tea leaves have grown slightly to avoid old leaves and ensure the quality of the new leaves. Except for the Mao Feng tea picked in the villages of Yanchuan and Jinzhu in the north, the mountain households in the northeast are also hiring workers to help. If the weather continues to be sunny, the tea gardens are scheduled to open in the next day or two. The tea firms are happy because the tea production this year is good, and they have been urging tea masters and tea workers to prepare for the opening of the tea gardens and weighing early.</p>
<p>Tunxi Tea Firms Open One After Another</p>
<p>Recently, the tea firms in Tunxi are preparing to pick and process new tea leaves from various places. Because tea firms in various places suffered losses last year, they are all planning to lower the mountain prices this year. The tea leaves are also young, and labor and miscellaneous costs are lower than before. The original firms, who planned not to open the tea farms and process tea, are now taking action. The Bank of China and money shops in this city are transporting large amounts of foreign silver from Shanghai and Hangzhou to meet the needs of the firms. In recent days, the number of firms preparing to open tea farms is as follows: Yixinxing, Zhenchang, Yongtaixin, etc. in Tunxi (7 firms), Wanxiang, Lianjidong, Xinjie, etc. in Baishu (7 firms), Yongdaxiang, Yiyifen, etc. in Shushuyuan (3 firms), Yonghuagong, Yongshengchang, etc. in Liyang (4 firms), Wuyihe, Wuyongyuan, etc. in Yanghu (8 firms), and Renheyuan, Zhizhonghe, etc. in Qianchuntan (4 firms), totaling 33 firms. The number of tea merchants opening tea farms is as follows: Huguangmao, Hongjucheng, etc. (4 firms). Until recently, the number of tea firms has decreased by 22 and the number of tea merchants has decreased by 3 compared to the old number. If the Shanghai market can return to a good state, there are still a few tea firms planning to open tea farms.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Shows Slight Activity</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was relatively stable. The association sold several hundred bags of Grade 24 coarse white sugar at 20 yuan. Grade 20 medium white sugar was quoted at 19 yuan and 5 jiao, Grade 18 at 19 yuan and 4 jiao, and Grades 8 and 9 Hechi sugar at 16 yuan, but no transactions were made. Only C.W. branded Taikoo refined sugar was traded at 21 yuan and 5 jiao and a half. Guangdong and Chaozhou merchants offered over 400 baskets of high-grade sliced sugar at 8 yuan and 4 jiao, and ordinary goods at 8 yuan. Huizhou merchants offered hundreds of bags at 17 yuan and 1 jiao to 16 yuan and 9 jiao. Hainan red sugar offered over 200 bags, the higher-grade was priced at 13 yuan and 8 jiao and a half, and the lower-grade was priced at 13 yuan and 7 jiao to 13 yuan and a half.</p>
<p>Grain: Rice in Hexia Fluctuates</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were thirty to forty sources, and the demand from urban and rural stores was acceptable, but the situation seemed to be turning weak, so Suzhou Tong and Nangang thick rice markets were stable. Later, the Nanyang merchants tried to purchase four or five hundred bags of Suzhou Tong, so the sellers wanted to tighten the price, but in the end, due to uncertain sentiment, the price rose slightly by a few fen. In the thin rice market, because there were only a few Beiyang merchants purchasing three or four hundred bags of Qingsi thin rice on Sunday, the market was soft, and the price fell by a jiao. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan remained stable, and the price was unchanged.</p>

The arrival of Yangjian continued, and the scattered demand was acceptable. The market was tight, and the middle and lower grades were stable. The price of Bodu Kejian was unchanged, and Yin Bianyuan was weak.</p>

<p>In addition to the usual sounds of dumping chamber pots, selling newspapers, bicycle bells, hawkers' shouts, and the chattering and noisy sounds, today these sounds were jarringly added to the mix, entering my eardrums from the window of the pavilion where I was still in bed. At that time, my brain immediately issued a secret order: "Join the excitement!" So I jumped out of bed and rummaged through drawers, under pillows, and in the corners of boxes for a long time, but couldn't find a single cent. I regretted, "I shouldn't have spent two jiao in the noodle shop yesterday!" But I was still fortunate to have two legs. I immediately opened up the throttle and accelerated towards the most lively place today—it took a full two and a half hours! It can be said that this is something I have never done since I had the experience of being breastfed: "Taking a long journey on a gloomy morning."</p>
<p>"Stalls, vendors, cars, people, shouts, crowding, crowding, still crowding!" This is a quick sketch in front of the temple gate.</p>
<p>In the crowd, I was indeed worthy of being a strong person. I quickly squeezed into the temple! Ah! There was a sound movie being shown here: In a religious event, there were poor people, rich people; there were people from the countryside and people from the city; there were young ladies from deep boudoirs, old ladies who never saw the sun all year round; there were young men in suits, modern ladies; there were pregnant women with big bellies, old men walking unsteadily; and there were Western men, foreign sailors... A variety of colors, which made my head dizzy! I found that they each had different hearts: a heart for seeking wealth, a heart for seeking blessings, a heart for seeking longevity, a heart for seeking to avoid disasters, a heart for seeking a lover, a heart for seeking to give birth to a son, a heart for saving all living beings, and also a heart for harboring evil intentions. Western men had a heart for visiting our Eastern spiritual civilization: foreign sailors had a heart for being warlords, for invading weak nations! (My heart is empty, and I dare not have any evil and obscene thoughts, for fear that the Buddha and Bodhisattva will show their divine power and suddenly bring down disasters, which would hurt my stomach, and that would not be fun!) Those Buddha grandpas, Buddha grandmas, Buddha youths, and Buddha ladies, all with yellow cloth bags on their backs, holding incense and candles in their hands, without looking around, muttering words in their mouths (probably asking the Buddha and Bodhisattva to grant them the realization of their hidden hearts!) It was pitiful that they kept rising and falling, cooperating with their hands and feet without being able to stop. I stood aside, silently holding my breath, and watched for a full one hundred and several minutes. I actually discovered my old classmate Gengsheng, whom I hadn't seen for three years, in the "rising and falling." The person "rising and falling" with him was probably his wife (I thought to myself: they are here to ask for a son.) So I immediately grabbed him and very quickly turned my mind (at this time I couldn't care about the divine power of the Buddha and Bodhisattva) and took advantage of them, asking them to take me on the tram.</p>
<p>The three of us squeezed out of the temple gate and walked to the intersection of Hardoon Road. In the crowd, a Western missionary suddenly handed me a "Gospel." Gengsheng said in surprise: "This missionary's propaganda skills are very good. Not too close and not too far, he happened to preach at the gate of Jing'an Temple. Maybe he wants to use Jesus Christ to resist our Sakyamuni Buddha." Back in the small pavilion, lying on the bed, my legs were sore and my stomach was rumbling...</p>
<h3>Happy People</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>A month ago, my friend returned from the North Country. He was sold to the North Country for the price of thirty yuan. Three years ago, in the spring, I was suffering from early-stage tuberculosis and was recuperating in a small hospital; he was quietly going to the North Country at this time, as difficult as being hit by champagne. Many poor friends didn't want me to know this news, fearing that I would feel sad about parting, so he didn't come to my hospital to say goodbye and left quietly for that desert-like North Country. In fact, this is such a lovely message, who among many friends is qualified to sell their body for thirty yuan a month. I am grateful to my friend for his love on the one hand, and I seem to be unable to send him off and consider it a regret.</p>
<p>This time, although he didn't return home in glory, he was still able to return with a somewhat older appearance, still able to be like a rustic</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Gleanings</p>
<p>War clouds hang over Liaoning at midnight, while the city of Yan sings and dances in the backyard at three in the morning. The young masters are oblivious to the sorrow of national subjugation, still claiming to hold the reins of power.</p>
<p>Offering Shenyang, entertaining guests in Fengtian (Mukden), and opening the Yuguan Pass step by step – it is only because China has so much land that such gifts and tributes are deemed reasonable.</p>
<p>Majestic and awe-inspiring, the Beida Camp, yet heartbrokenly falls to the enemy in Shenyang overnight. How can one resist external aggression while failing to secure internal stability, leaving a legacy of not fighting for millennia?</p>
<p>With the nation's rivers and mountains shattered and the country in peril, generals hesitate and fail to dispatch troops. They allow Rehe to fall to Japanese pirates, with the sound of cannons directly threatening the Phoenix Pool.</p>
<p>Coming back as before, he ultimately did not sell his soul for thirty dollars. As for myself, the poor cannot afford to fall ill. The extent of my lung disease is unknown, but working at a newspaper is considered by my friends a good career suited to my personality. So, in a month when spring descended upon Shanghai, we went to Longhua, acting like young masters on a spring outing; we went to Bansong Garden, chasing inexplicably touching singers in the small river; in the afterglow of the setting sun, we strolled along Avenue Joffre, our hearts lively and our steps light; at dawn, we went to the Bund, our spirits serene and our attitudes vibrant. A month passed quickly, and spring imperceptibly faded with the growth of the fledglings. My friend will once again be sent to the desolate northern lands.</p>
<p>I am still sick, but I can no longer afford to stay in small hospitals. Because I am naturally straightforward and unable to keep pace with the times, I have finally been squeezed out of the crowd of those who sell their bodies. On my last day at the newspaper, I said, "Shall I stake my body as a last resort? Perhaps there will be a day when I return in a car!" Friends, don't laugh at my foolishness, as many people dream of doing this; many people have already done it and returned in cars! That very night, I was able to personally attend the farewell dinner for my friend at the restaurant, fulfilling something I had regretted three years ago in such an environment!</p>
<p>Farewell events like this are a first for me. Although filled with the excitement of drinking and singing loudly, they also contained a tinge of melancholy. There was a reason why my friends didn't tell me last time, as his return to the northern lands is not exactly a delightful prospect.</p>
<p>Returning from the farewell at the North Station, it was already late at night, and all was silent. Several friends walked silently, stepping on their own shadows. Perhaps they all shared the same sentiment: those who can sell their bodies are still fortunate!</p>
<h3>Poor Talk</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yan</p>
<p>When a person is poor, everywhere they look they see poverty. They speak poor words, write poor articles, read poor newspapers, and associate with poor friends. What I like to read most are the great articles in this publication because what is written and published are mostly poor articles, like the lives in the garrets, the communications of shop assistants, and the self-introductions of clerks. Aren't those poor talk? I think the editor of this publication must also be a poor editor, so they especially welcome those poor manuscripts, publishing them as much as possible, giving us poor folks a little bit of life.</p>
<p>Speaking further, when a person is poor, they must never show it. Otherwise, you will be ridiculed and called a "poor devil" everywhere you go. To be a poor person, you must pretend to have a "starving belly but a full chest" so as not to expose the Western-style magic lantern. The eyes of people in the city are like dogs, specifically looking down on the poor.</p>
<p>But even if I say so, I always try to hide my poverty. Sometimes I think to myself, "Even if a person is poor, their appearance must not be poor." Thinking this way, my face immediately assumes an optimistic and cheerful look. At that moment, the clueless old woman with the yellow face, holding</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>her little boy, comes up to me and says, "Hey, little guy. The infant formula is finished. When you go out, buy a can back, don't forget. Also, the landlord downstairs says we are over ten days late on the rent. If we don't pay soon, they are going to put up a 'for rent' sign. Furthermore, my grandfather is turning fifty the day after tomorrow. What are you planning to give him?" After this long speech, my optimistic and cheerful face immediately changes back to a frowning and worried one. I think, the infant formula costs at least two "sheep" (slang for currency), the rent costs eight "sheep," and my father-in-law's birthday requires at least peach-shaped buns, cakes, candles, and incense, which will cost another four "sheep." In total, that's fourteen old "sheep." At that moment, I only have two dimes and six copper coins in my pocket. So, after thinking hard, I rummage through the two broken suitcases, find a few unripped clothes, pack them up, and head out the door. At the pawnshop, the clerk, seeing I am a regular customer, finally helps me out and pawns them for nine "sheep," otherwise, they would have been worth at most seven "sheep." I think, now I only have nine "sheep," which is not enough. So, I brace myself and run home to discuss the matter with the landlord. Luckily, the old landlord, for some unknown reason, finds me quite pitiful and agrees to postpone the payment for a few days. At that moment, I think, this crisis can be overcome, and my face brightens up again. I immediately go out, buy a can of infant formula, order the peach-shaped buns and cakes, and buy the candles and incense. I even have a few "sheep" left over to prepare for dinner. Unexpectedly, my wife comes to make things difficult for me again. She says, "Honey, the day after tomorrow, I am going to my dad's to celebrate his birthday. You need to redeem my cheongsam and my ring, otherwise, how can I go in these tattered clothes?" Hearing this, I am stunned for a long time. I think, the cheongsam was pawned for five yuan, and the ring for fourteen yuan, totaling nineteen yuan. This crisis is truly unsolvable. I can only say to her, "Please forgive me, I really have no way right now. The woman upstairs has many cheongsams, and the length is about the same as yours. Maybe you can borrow one to wear." Speaking of poor talk here, because the kerosene lamp is burning out, I have to put down my poor pen. I will talk more next time.</p>

<h3>The Fall of White</h3>
<p>— Chang Zhao</p>
<p>One dark night in the early summer of last year, I came out of my maternal grandparents' house. A light rain was falling from the sky. The surrounding air was very quiet, and there was no one at the taxi stand. Only some intermittent domino sounds came from the paper shop across the street. The rain was getting heavier and heavier. The fine raindrops flew across my face, making me feel uncomfortable. The streetcar had not yet arrived, so I had to quietly watch the taxis speeding past, splashing mud, and the stars twinkling in the sky.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I heard some sounds like a balalaika. I knew this was coming from the nearby dilapidated White Russian family. The tune was not very skilled, probably played by a novice. As I was unconsciously enjoying this foreign atmosphere, suddenly it seemed like someone was talking to me from behind. I turned around and saw a middle-aged, obese Russian woman gesturing to me, which surprised me greatly. I never expected such a thing to happen, so I looked at her with a curious gaze.</p>
<p>She was already a middle-aged woman. Although she had smeared her face with powder and lipstick, she could not hide her age. She had completely lost the beauty of youth and the ability to seduce; she could no longer evoke people's emotions for her. But what did she want from me? Did she want money from me? From her sorrowful expression, I knew she wanted me to help her, but I could not understand her words.</p>
<p>"WHAT DO YOU WANT?" I asked her.</p>
<p>"Giv… Giv…" She looked even more pitiful. But I still didn't understand what she was saying. Her broken English didn't make it clear to me.</p>
<p>"WHAT DO YOU WANT I SAY?" I asked her again.</p>
<p>"Giv… Giv… Dollars… Dollars…" She seemed about to cry.</p>
<p>Ah! This time I understood. But, ah! You wandering, fallen woman in a foreign land! I am very ashamed. Please go and patronize someone else!</p>
<p>"OH, I CAN'T"</p>
<p>She was disappointed. With tears in her eyes, she slowly disappeared into the dense rain.</p>
<p>This aroused my empathy. I expressed my deep sympathy for this pitiful Russian woman. Please don't underestimate her! Perhaps she was a noble woman in Imperial Russia. Who knows, she might have been a member of the royal family, a princess, or the wife of a grand duke! Perhaps many young and noble princes had knelt before her, perhaps she had worn priceless jewelry around her neck, she had ordered servants around and enjoyed happiness. But what is she now? How is she living this fallen life in Shanghai, in this foreign land, in this dark night of wind and rain! Of course, as long as I was happy, couldn't I have enjoyed the same pleasure as the noble princes that night? And wouldn't she have offered her favors to me as she had offered them to the princes?</p>
<p>But isn't everything in the world like this? Our country's corrupt officials! Look at this! Don't be too complacent, who knows if your wives and daughters won't end up like this shameless Russian woman? According to</p>
<h3>Dance Halls and Vegetable Markets</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>| The Dividing Line Between Generosity and Stinginess |</p>
<p>This title is obviously a bit far-fetched. The dance hall, a place of high culture, is actually linked to the lowly vegetable market, the place where mundane things like rice, salt, oil, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea are sold. It might make readers "cover their noses and turn away," and even more likely earn the title of "a filthy literary beggar!"</p>
<p>I frankly confess that people who make a living by writing for newspapers are mostly like this. Moreover, in evaluating duties and assigning tasks, this publication seems to only need to shoulder such small missions. As for "national affairs," there are already plenty of big shots and gentlemen making a racket about them on and off stage, so there's no need for us to presumptuously babble about them.</p>
<p>It's embarrassing to say, but dancing in Shanghai is already commonplace, while I am still a complete outsider. Fortunately, I have studied for a few years and have gained some basic knowledge of this subject from the streets, alleys, newspapers, and magazines. I know that "dancing" is divided into "social dance," "nude dance," "foxtrot," "costume dance," and "tea dance." Among them, "social dance" is the most popular, and its seductive power is the strongest. What is praised the most by dance-addicted compatriots is "nude dance." The name "tea dance" originated recently and is said to be related to national salvation, so the mission of the dance hall has become even greater. Usually, we only know that it is a business organization, but now "dancing for national salvation" is all the rage, almost on par with "aviation for national salvation." It is indeed not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>The one or two dollars that make it into our pockets often stay there for many days, still warm and reluctant to spend. I hear that compatriots entering dance halls can only be intoxicated for a few minutes with one dollar. This is not so strange. What's really something is when it comes to opening a tab or paying for refreshments, they are generous and magnanimous. For example, when handing a waiter a five-dollar bill, which should have some change returned, they often don't bother with the change to show off their wealth. This earns the waiter a beaming face, welcoming them in and out, and responding quickly. Originally, people who step into dance halls, even if they are not all wealthy old men "with millions around their waist, spending money like water," are still those who have plenty of money to live on. Money is meant to be circulated, so being generous with a few dollars is only right.</p>
<p>However, this is what I want to say.</p>
<p>Not to mention how wealthy these people are, in the morning at the vegetable market, we can always see some young mistresses, wives, misses, and gentlemen who go to dance halls at night also squeezing into the crowd of fourth- or fifth-class people, bumping into each other. The difference is that they mostly have attendants with them! Maids and servants and the like. The money for buying vegetables is held in their own hands, while the vegetable basket is of course the responsibility of the attendants, who are like hungry eagles, darting through the crowd. Clearly, their appearance at this time is completely different from when they are intoxicated in the dance hall. It's almost like they are "thugs."</p>
<p>Look, how cunning and ruthless they are. First, they carefully examine the quality of the vegetables, turning them over and over. In order to make a sale, the vendors have no choice but to let them do as they please. Otherwise, they not only won't buy from you, but they will also glare at you. Next is a round of haggling over the price. After the price is agreed upon and they have gotten a good deal, there is bound to be a round of arguing about the weighing. The vendors want to use the public scale, but they insist on using their own old-fashioned scale with eighteen taels per catty. If you don't agree, they will drop the vegetables and turn away. The price is good, and the scale is accurate, so they should just pay the price, but they inevitably want to shave off one or two copper coins. In this way, the vendors have no choice but to swallow their losses in broad daylight. The worst part is that after the price is reduced, they often take an extra handful of vegetables. The vendors are flustered and can't help but get angry and curse, calling them "pigs," but they can tolerate it.</p>
<p>Friends who have visited the vegetable market, I believe, all agree. From this stinginess and pettiness, combined with the generosity and magnanimity in the dance hall, I can't help but exclaim repeatedly: "Heavens! Heavens!"</p>
<p>Communications from Shop Employees</p>
<p>Selling Secrets</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I am a trainee in a certain agency in this city, and my job is to assist in the management of documents. In this document management department, there is also a clerk in charge besides me. Speaking of document management, it is actually very easy! You just need to file them casually, avoiding accumulation, and patiently sort out the files clearly, and there is nothing much to it. Unexpectedly, this clerk is afraid that I will learn everything and steal his job, so he sells his secrets. He intentionally puts important documents, especially those that have not yet been processed and need to be retrieved every day, in random places. The file log and index are also drafted by him alone. I only copy them for him. When I am free, he also asks me to help him grade twenty or thirty exam papers because this clerk is also a teacher at XX night school! So, sometimes when he is not there, if the section chief wants to check the documents, I have no way to retrieve them. It is absolutely impossible until he comes. Therefore, the superiors all think I am useless, but it is really unfair. If the things are put by someone else, unless there is a fixed place, how can anyone find them! In this way, he is secure in his position and also gets a free helper. However, I am suffering. In the past two and a half years, my salary has not increased at all, and I am still receiving a subsidy of twelve yuan a month. Sir, I am not exaggerating. If he didn't mess things up, I could do all the document management work by myself, and there would be no need for any helpers. But the superiors would never believe this. Sincerely, Qian Ziqian</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The bad habit of selling secrets is very common in Chinese society. People only know that it is wrong and scold those who adopt this method. In fact, these people are also very pitiful. Like the clerk above, if he had security, that is, even if this trainee learned the document management work, his position would not be affected, and if the agency had a guarantee that all staff members' positions, except for a few political affairs departments, would be absolutely guaranteed, and there would be no major problems, I believe he would never sell his secrets. In civilized countries, there is no arbitrary dismissal for mistakes. Therefore, they do not need to sell secrets, and all their energy is focused on work. Scientific management can only be realized.</p>

<h3>The Life of the Five Beauties (Continued Three)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>However, all of this was incomprehensible to her young mind. It was said that the old woman in the house was not her mother, but she still had to call her "Mama." Although she had been used to calling her that since she was a child and didn't find it awkward, if her biological mother were still around, she would at least not be beaten for not liking to sing or for other small things. However, one thing was still worth being happy about, and that was that in front of the old woman, she had to call "Mama, Mama" very sweetly, but behind her back, she could still call her the old woman. Everyone in the house was like this, so she also gained this right invisibly.</p>
<p>In fact, she was not only often abused by the procuress but also greatly envied by the other girls. The biggest reason was that she was still fortunate enough to study. Inevitably, the girls would often poke her cheeks with their fingers and listen to her gnash her teeth and fiercely scold:</p>
<p>"You are too good-looking, you will be the old woman's cash cow when you grow up, so you are sent to school now, so that you can be a top-notch prostitute and make a lot of money."</p>
<p>Every time it was the same, letting other people's saliva spit on her face and wiping it off herself, because she really didn't have the courage to answer.</p>
<p>4 She Cried</p>
<p>In fact, she always felt that there were many things that she couldn't stand. For example, Jin Hua, who was only three years older than her, would change a different man every night. Some were as fat as pigs, and some even had black hair growing in their ears, which was simply scary. What were they doing? Everyone understood, and she understood it too. But sometimes it was too unsightly. They tried their best to hug the women and kiss them, it was like fighting. As a result, the women couldn't move, so they kissed them hard, even sticking their tongues into their mouths, with saliva dripping from the corners of their mouths. It was really terrible, extremely ugly. But that was not all. When they came running madly after drinking enough sorghum wine, they immediately grabbed one of them and went to bed, not bothering to close the door or even lower the curtains. This kind of thing happened often, so she also had many opportunities to see them lying there like dogs, naked.</p>
<p>Of course, this kind of thing would arouse her curiosity the first or second time, but after a long time, it became very ordinary and didn't matter much. However, when she thought that she would be like this in the future, she felt very scared.</p>

<h3>Hollywood Martial Arts Star George Brent's Adventurous Youth (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xun Nan</p>
<p>One day George Brent visited the priest again. It so happened that the Independent Party leader, Colin, was looking for a capable and reliable person to send a secret message to Belfansted. This Colin had been arrested twice by the British police, but he managed to escape. Now the British authorities have offered a reward for his arrest, so he goes out at night and hides during the day, and his actions are extremely secretive. The priest was Colin's close friend, and when he talked to George Brent about this matter, George felt extremely interested. He asked to try it out. At this time, there were hundreds of thousands of British troops in Ireland, maintaining an outwardly calm order throughout Ireland. The Irish people's every move was followed. The killing was so tragic that it could be called dark and sunless. Although George Brent's homeland was Ireland, he had been in the United States for many years and had obtained American citizenship. Moreover, his American accent would always make people think he was an American tourist wherever he went, and they would let him go easily. This was the best secret agent.</p>
<p>So George Brent took the secret documents and traveled from Dublin to Merfansted. He didn't know what was in the big envelope. His task was to take the documents to Belfansted and hand them over to a prearranged person. Other than that, he knew nothing.</p>
<p>From then on, George repeatedly carried secret documents back and forth between Dublin and Belfansted. He didn't know what fear was. He often rode on British troop carriers, sitting with British soldiers. At that time, George Brent was not an adventurer; he was just too young and didn't know what fear was. When he arrived in Belfansted, he also joined a large group of people, jumping to the execution ground to watch the Irish spies being shot. He never thought that one day he might also be standing with them to be shot.</p>
<p>As for where George got his expenses at that time, it's also very interesting to talk about. The first time he took the secret documents to the Belfansted Independent Party secret agency, someone asked him if he wanted money to spend. George nodded, and the person put a large roll of banknotes in his pocket. So his salary was unlimited. As long as he asked, there was never a shortage. From then on, he traveled to various places, pretending to be an American rich kid coming to Ireland, half for travel and half for study. He said that he was very free and happy at that time, and the only regret was that his superiors strictly forbade him from fighting with others.</p>
<p>During this year, it was not without danger. Sometimes, the innkeeper was too concerned about him, and he was afraid of problems, so he tried to avoid it. Sometimes, people noticed his actions. He tried to escape. One day, it was very dangerous. That day, he took secret documents from Dublin to Belfansted. Because it was still early, he wandered around on the street. When he returned to the inn, the innkeeper told him that his luggage had been searched. It was very dangerous. Fortunately, he carried the secret documents with him. But fearing that the British police would come again! He tried to move to another place. (The End)</p>
<p>Audience Feedback</p>
<h3>After Watching "Moral Treasure Mirror"</h3>
<p>— Qi Yu</p>
<p>The film industry in 1933 went through a major transformation, from a struggle out of the remnants of feudalism to a new stage. In this process, we need constant effort and struggle to achieve fruitful results.</p>
<p>Does Star Film's new film, "Moral Treasure Mirror" (originally titled "Humanitarian Thief"), fulfill its mission in this important process? I would first definitely say that the consciousness of "Moral Treasure Mirror" is unhealthy. The motive of the film is to expose the true faces of some hypocrites and reveal the inside story of humanity to show people. So Zhuang Da Dao is used to represent this group of thieves. However, because of the overemphasis on the result, it has become a record of retribution lacking stimulation. This causal cycle is still due to coincidence. For example, Zhuang Dadao coincidentally comes to the South, Zhuang Zhiqing coincidentally leaves a note at the dormitory, and Zhiqing's banquet just happens to be at the hotel managed by Jin Zhonghu, all of which are constructed under fantasy.</p>
<p>Second, what is the instruction for the audience? There is one! Go back to the countryside, the countryside is at least cleaner than the city. However, the screenwriter forgot that the economic forces of imperialism have invaded the countryside, and the countryside is on the path to bankruptcy. At the same time, the evils of the city are also rapidly flowing into the countryside. Whether the countryside is a paradise is a question. To take a step back, the countryside can be returned to, but this passive method of escaping reality is by no means the policy we should take. We escape from the city to the countryside. If the countryside is not a clean place, where do we go?</p>
<h3>After Viewing "Orphan Army"</h3>
<p>— Shi Meizheng</p>
<p>The film "Orphan Army," which gained extraordinary publicity due to the accidental death of Yang Liuqing during filming in "Yangliuqing," has already been publicly screened at the Beijing Grand Theater! Undeniably, before watching this film, we thought in our hearts: how great and sacrificial this film would be. Moreover, the inscription and praise from important figures of the National Government further convinced people of its greatness without a doubt. I, too, had wanted to see the film for a long time, so I drove to Beijing on the afternoon of the fifth to see this "Orphan Army" of iron blood patriotism bought with life.</p>
<p>However, I was very disappointed. When I left the theater after the screening, I thought on the way home: the story of this film is too disappointing! It's simply incomprehensible. Here, I am not intentionally slandering the Dazhong Company. All the gentlemen who have seen this film will not deny it, right?</p>
<p>The opening scenes take place in a deep mountain forest, with many soldiers in action, blindly shooting many meaningless scenes. Later, the soldiers disappeared, followed by a dozen cavalrymen galloping around randomly; whether it's said to be fighting! It can also be said to be a race. This scene was also blindly filmed for many feet.</p>
<p>There are really many places in this film that are unreasonable. Let me give one example: In a certain section, the so-called "enemy" officer inquired that a so-called "orphan army" was coming to attack their rear! The officer, unable to mobilize troops in time, secretly sent a female spy to devise a plan to stop the advance of this "orphan army" midway. After a while, the cavalry orphan army indeed arrived, and without finding out the enemy's trail, rashly lodged in the home of a woman they had never met (i.e., the female spy). The woman even bared her fair body, flirting and flattering the orphan army captain, and the captain seemed intentionally unintentional, not suspecting the woman's oddity at all; although he was not moved by her seduction.</p>
<p>The next day, the captain discovered that the woman was using the phone to call the enemy; at this time, he should have immediately taken action! But, no, the reality is contrary to the ideal; not only did the captain not capture or question the woman, but he also left without suspicion!</p>
<p>Let's talk about the inscriptions of important figures, which are like the epitaphs printed on obituaries for funerals; this is really meaningless.</p>
<p>After all, it is a small production company, and the capital is still not substantial, and the talent is naturally lacking; we should understand this failure, and hope that the authorities of Dazhong Company will continue to struggle and work hard in the future!</p>
<h3>A Pity for "Orphan Army"</h3>
<p>— Wu Hong</p>
<p>In this time of national crisis, when the mountains and rivers are changing color and the country is falling, what we see and hear every day, in addition to the retreat of the non-resistance army, is the bloody battle of the "orphan army" outside the Great Wall. Therefore, when we hear the words "orphan army," we can vaguely think of a tragic war history in a remote border region, with blood spilling in the autumn wind. This is such a moving name.</p>
<p>However, when we saw the "orphan army" on the screen, we couldn't help but feel disappointed, because this film can only tell us the evolution of a period of facts, and did not expose the enemy's brutality as a whole, nor did it tell us about the oppression suffered by this "orphan army" that was cut off from support and exhausted of ammunition, and the great fearless spirit it held, so there is nothing moving about it.</p>
<p>Originally, war films are not easy to please without a great economic backing. However, if the director understands this difficulty, he can focus on "expression" and use "war" as a background. This is the first important strategy to hide clumsiness. Moreover, if you want to express a spirit of "serving the country," it is by no means possible to achieve it by a blind melee. If you progress from the aspect of expression, you may have a more profound harvest, but the director of this film does not do this, ignoring the expression of the actors and focusing on seeking progress from the artillery fire, so the weaknesses are fully exposed, and the whole play is scattered to the point of being without purpose or meaning.</p>
<p>Finally, I feel that now we need this kind of patriotic war film. Although Orphan Army cannot completely satisfy us, I always hope that the film industry can have successors to strive for, to awaken the dying national soul and revive the national spirit. This is also a responsibility shared by the war film industry!</p>
<h3>Reflections After Watching "Orphan Army"</h3>
<p>— Zhan Ding</p>
<p>Dazzled by the huge advertisements in the newspaper, and shocked by the name of Yang Liuqing, who sacrificed for art, I had been thinking about seeing "Orphan Army" for a long time, and finally spent two hours of precious time seeing it on the screen.</p>
<p>When the lights dimmed and the screen brightened, I also cheered up and appreciated it from beginning to end. There are really too many inappropriate places in it to enumerate.</p>
<p>But can I say that this film has no value at all? That's not true. In the early days of our country's film industry, it is inevitable that there will be places where things are just a pretense, especially since this film is based on struggle and patriotism. If it is compared with foreign products such as "All Quiet on the Western Front," it is naturally a small witch compared to a great one. But in today's China, especially when "the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every man," this kind of film full of iron blood and loyalty is what we need even more.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that many film companies will work harder. Because what we need now is iron and blood. Not those mesmerizing legs, women, wine…</p>
<p>In addition, the tragic music in this film really gives the whole film great power and vibrant vitality.</p>
<h3>Famous Musicians in Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Among the tens of millions of film industry figures in Hollywood, musicians are indispensable. But among many musicians, none can compare to DICK POWELL of Warner Brothers.</p>
<p>Dick Powell has three brothers, and Dick is the youngest. His father was an American music scoring expert. All three brothers were influenced by their father and immersed in orchestra from an early age. Dick Powell's eldest brother inherited his father's position in the music world and continued to arrange music scores in the United States. Dick's second brother also relied on his father's reputation to work at the New York Conservatory of Music. And among the three brothers, Dick's skills are the most exquisite, so he can live independently by playing music.</p>
<p>Before Dick Powell came to Hollywood, he performed at concerts in Broadway, Pittsburgh, and other places. In addition, the famous Los Angeles stage also had his traces. He can play all musical instruments such as violin, piano, flute, and trumpet, but he is especially good at violin and piano. He was first invited to Hollywood by the Los Angeles Grand Theater. He earned more than five thousand American dollars a week in New York and Pittsburgh, so he didn't intend to enter the film industry. But Warner Brothers examined that he had the talent to act in film and drama, so they insisted on hiring him. But Dick was unwilling to give up his family's inherited skills. Although he agreed, he stated that he could only regard the film industry as a side job, and could only film movies for twelve weeks a year. Of course, Warner Company knew his position and couldn't force him.</p>
<p>Dick Powell's performances in New York are always full, and his skills are indeed intoxicating. But it is a pity that his voice has some shortcomings and cannot sing too high, so a natural musician can only play but not sing, which is a regret that many people have for him.</p>
<h3>The Secret of Movie Novels (SECRETS) (2)</h3>
<p>— Luo</p>
<p>But "Heaven has unpredictable winds and clouds, and people have misfortunes and blessings." Manly and Susheng and others thought that it was very secret, extremely safe action, but one day it was discovered by the suspicious and violent William McRow. He personally opened the letter and read what was written on it. My dear John: Today is a memorial day. You and I have known each other until now.</p>
<p>It's fourteen days and seven hours. Because there is a banquet at home tonight, please Lord Hurley,</p>
<p>I can't meet you. But definitely tomorrow. I love you! I love! I love you! Manly</p>
<p>Below is also a large string of AIDS symbols. William read it and was furious. He called John Carton and asked, "Is this a letter written by my daughter herself?" John said, "Yes." William asked again, "Are you what is called in this letter..." He couldn't say it anymore. John continued to say to him; "Dear John? Yes, that's me."</p>
<p>When William heard it, his eyes fired and he cursed, "You bastard! You despicable and shameless bastard!" John retorted, "I'm not a bastard, I'm an extremely sober and God-fearing person. But I love your daughter, and I want to marry her."</p>
<p>"Naturally a rich man's daughter, who else would you try to seduce if you don't try to seduce her? Give me your things and get out of here! I don't need you anymore!"</p>
<p>"As you wish," John said calmly to the furious William McRow, "But before I leave, I still have to ask you to give me a letter proving my integrity and talent."</p>
<p>"Nonsense! I still have to write a letter to prove your integrity and talent?"</p>
<p>"Don't even dream about it! I will naturally find a way for you, and you won't find anything to do in New England." William said. He leaned on the table and wrote a check, two weeks' salary for John, and handed it to John, saying, "This is your salary, take it and get out of here!"</p>
<p>John took the check. He slowly tore the check into small pieces and deliberately threw it on his employer's table. William looked surprised, as if how could there be anyone in the world who doesn't want to see money. Suddenly he roared in anger again; "You bastard, you will regret it one day as long as you live in this world!"</p>
<p>When Cheng Lian was slapping the table and cursing, John Carton quietly bowed to him and went out. (To be continued)</p>
