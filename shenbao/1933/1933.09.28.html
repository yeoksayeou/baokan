<h3>方振武部襲高麗營被擊退</h3>
<p>官軍受協定拘束未追擊</p>
<p>吉部在牛坊與官軍接觸</p>
<p>方吉部隊聯合向西南移</p>
<p>戰事似將側重湯山方面</p>
<p>日軍謂方吉已退出非武裝區暫取監視態度</p>
<p>一說方軍撤回懹柔附近另向平東有所企圖</p>
<p>（北平）軍訊八仙莊電、方部約一千餘人、昨由牛欄山開拔後、即向南移動、午後六時許、進擾高麗營、意圖南竄、當經駐軍堵截、激戰甚烈、直至今日拂曉、該軍不支後退、現駐高麗營北十五里之板橋村、我軍因顧全停戰恊定、未便追擊、雙方正對峙中、通州電、今午方部下有一小部竄至立水橋地方、在平北約三十餘里、當與該地駐軍第二十五師之一部發生衝突、旋即退去、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）方振武之主力部隊均集結於板橋東西水泉一帶、方本人即駐西水泉、此間軍隊於奪回高麗營後、因該方鄰近非武裝區域、未向前追擊、同時因該地不便兜剿、擬將陣地移至口口一帶、誘方部深入、但方部知此間有備、不敢南進、今午後方部復有一部在距高麗營西北一里之河溝、隔岸以槍砲向高麗營轟擊、此間軍隊亦回砲還擊、同時口面防線亦有一部方軍進擾、砲聲時斷時續、方部因後方大部分部隊正陸續向西開進、故作牽掣、藉資掩護、迄今傍晚止、方部已抵距大小湯山四里之牛坊地方、與該地吉部取得聯絡、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）吉鴻昌軍昨晚佔據距湯山以東四里之牛坊、與官軍王營接觸、其另一部繞道開至湯山以北昌平縣屬之之茶塢、與此間官軍朱師接觸、自昨夜迄至今傍晚、槍砲聲始終未停、戰事頗緊張、今晚方吉兩部會合、總數共三千餘人、有將聯合向西逃竄之勢、戰事殆將趨重大小湯山方面、此間軍隊已佈置重兵、在該處防堵、日軍以今爲警告方部離開戰區期限届滿、二十六即由密雲派日軍二百人、開抵牛欄山、防阻方部東竄、迄今止因方部陸續西移、故對方部無何動作、據日方稱、暫持監視態度、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）某軍事機關接前方報告、方軍因攻擊高麗營失敗、今日下午三時撤回懷柔縣橋梓村南北石漕附近、留少數部隊在前方活動、擬向平東另有企圖、當局已嚴令駐順義通縣駐軍嚴防、高麗營東北附近十一二里內、已無敵踪、因吉軍擾亂萬軍部之第一綫部隊、不時用砲炸威脅、大湯山吉軍擬向昌平發展、密雲日軍第三十二聯隊未向懷柔移動、·據日方宣稱、方吉軍已退出懷柔城、故無開往驅逐必要、前方情形、因方吉兩部利用小部、實行游擊、故各地隨時有局部戰事發生、我軍在北平一帶、平方防務極鞏固、·（二十七日專電）</p>
<h3>日機飛高麗營投彈</h3>
<p>（北平）今晨日機兩架、飛高麗營、投炸彈二枚、炸死我趙團士兵二、傷三人、趙團長談、二十六晨四時許、方部乘我軍換防時、令其王軍之董孟武約千人、向高麗營進襲、董團數百人入東門、我軍入西門、發生巷戰、雙方相距僅數十米、至午戰事最烈、午後稍息、入晚僅有斷績槍聲、日機昨在東西水泉之方部防地投彈兩枚、此役我軍死五六人、傷數十人、方部死百餘人、被俘數人、佩抗日救國軍第四軍番號臂章、上書捨身抗日剷除貪污等字樣、今晨方部忽分兩路退去、一路東北、一路向北、吉部現盤據高麗營西北之秦家山上院下院東西辛村等處、似欲向大小湯山前進、昨有吉部騎兵四五百人、步兵五六百人、與駐防當地王營接觸、今晨無戰事、西北至昌平附近、仍爲吉部、昨夜與我軍朱師接觸、迨今晨戰事未息、方吉企圖迄未完全判明、各線官軍佈置完密、北平治安可無慮、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）昨日高麗營戰事之詳情、今漸傳來、方部騎兵一隊進撲高麗營、希圖馳入、政府軍三百名起而抵禦、巷戰多時、乃圍攻而敗之、政府軍僅死一名、傷十名、方部主力目下似在高麗營稍北之板橋備戰、其地仍在不設軍備區域內、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（北平）華字報載稱、日軍不待哀的美敦書之期滿、昨即以四飛機至高麗營附近擲落炸彈、方軍死傷甚多、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（北平）此間日官塲徵實日軍事當局不欲攻擊非武裝區域內之方部之說、蓋欲避免使當地人民受無謂流血之禍也、據華人消息、吉部漸退唐山停戰線、似無屈服之象、但如進攻、則政府軍擬加抵禦、又據華人消息、今晨有日軍事飛機兩架飛至高麗營停戰線、擲下炸彈兩枚、死官兵兩名、又傷三名、（二十七日路透社電）</p>
<h3>軍分會令各軍嚴防</h3>
<p>（北平）軍分會今晨常會到萬福麟·商震·榮臻·蔣伯誠等何應欽主席、報告昨晨四時、方部與一一九師之李營衝突經過、謂方部主力約二三千人、在高麗營北之板橋及東西水泉村一帶盤踞、昨衝突後、連續戰至今拂曉、始停戰、一二九師之兩團趕到、將方部包圍、方部不支分兩路逃竄、一向東北、一向正北、又逃入非武裝區域內、我軍未追擊、正嚴防中、次由萬報告、謂吉部約二千餘人、在高麗營西北之大小湯山地方、昨下午七時、與第一百三十師發生戰事、至今午尙在相持中、萬報告後、復由何氏報告謂據殷同所得日方報告、方吉兩部被國軍壓迫、已向通州方面逃竄、經出席各委員討論後、决議、分飭各軍嚴防、旋即討論議案、議决、通過經理監察委員會組織大綱、决設委員十名、委員長名委員人選尙未推定、又整頓各部軍風紀案及其他例案多件、（二十七日專電）</p>
<h3>湯玉麟表示不參與</h3>
<p>（北平）軍息、湯玉麟派其參謀長王鴻儒二十七到平、即赴居仁堂謁何、表示該軍仍駐原地未動、與方吉兩部毫無關係、謠傳湯部與方吉合作說、全屬子虛、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>（東京）據陸軍省接電、在獨石口之劉桂堂軍、已由何應欽任命爲察哈爾剿匪總司令、無前進之意、湯玉麟亦不前進、因此由懷柔移向順義方面之方振武吉鴻昌軍約八千、（實力僅二千）完全陷於孤立狀態、故數日內即可自然潰滅、（二十七日電通社電）</p>
<h3>方致何電言詞含混</h3>
<p>（北平）方振武有電致何、大意謂如政治上有辦法、一切可以商量、言詞極含混、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）方振武連日派代表分赴各方接洽、平方亦有代表到來、向當局轉逹方意、表示願欲離軍、惟是否誠意、或另有企圖、尙未判明、（二十七日專電）</p>
<h3>日軍已到逹牛欄山</h3>
<p>（北平）順義電、昨日上午一時、方部由牛欄山分兩頭向東向南開拔、天尙未明即有日軍百餘人到逹牛欄山、至今並無若何舉動、又昨日上午十一時許有日機二架、到縣偵察、繞城二週、向東飛去、並散放傳單甚多、大意驅逐方部速退出非武裝區域以外、否則日軍即加以撻伐、下午一時許、又來日機一架、偵察數周、向東飛去、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>（東京）北平來電、方振武吉鴻昌軍自昨夜迄今晨、由牛欄山逃往高麗營及湯山方面、方部在高麗營與萬福麟之百二十九師、發生衝突、遭該師猛烈之射擊、致死傷多數、後圖逃往三河方面、因商震軍阻止在前、現陷無路可趨、高麗營已歸中央軍掌握、一方吉鴻昌部方入湯山、即被該處之百三十師一部發覺、自晨以來、仍在接觸、目下雙方對峙之勢、（二十七日電通電）</p>
<h3>日軍官赴前方視察</h3>
<p>（北平）駐平日兵營、今日下午一時許、派上尉武官一名、偕隨員二名、由軍分會派員伴送、離平北去、逕赴高麗營視察一切、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）方振武軍是否退出停戰恊定區域以外、駐平日軍派參謀誠方氏實地由南方視察、該參謀已由中國方面之軍官陪同出發、於本日午後二時由平起程急往高麗營矣、（二十七日日聯電）</p>
<h3>方吉兩部將趨西南</h3>
<p>（北平）北平來電、方吉聯合軍、今已四面被圍、北方之牛欄山爲日本軍、東西南爲中央軍、已陷重圍、故其主力約六千、急於覓取逃出途徑、因中央軍不能向停戰區域內進攻、擬於夜間、沿停戰恊定線圖逃往西南京綏線方面、又今晨以來、在高麗營、被中央軍猛擊、棄三河而逃之方振武軍一部、已遁入通州方面、但自通州以迄順義、有商震軍嚴重警戒、當然將被商部消滅也、（二十七日電通電）</p>
<p>（北平）關東軍以方振武吉鴻昌軍若從牛欄山逃竄時而擊潰之、勢必與灤東之股匪合、反有使事態擴大之虞、决阻止之將其逐至西南方面、故方等在停戰恊定區域外之出路、將由平綏綫昌平南口、加以壓迫、使竄山西、（二十七日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）陸軍省今日發表公報稱、方振武·吉鴻昌·二軍已徇從關東軍之請、退出華北非武裝區、（二十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（北平）不設軍備區域今晨尙稱安謐、行將開戰之地段亦無消息傳來、當道關於中日商妥處置方軍之辦法、默無一言、據外間傳稱、日方已與軍委分會商妥、迫令方軍開至休戰線、而由政府軍繳其武裝、每槍一枝、給資少許、但方軍是否能就範、尙屬疑問也、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（北平）據此間日人方面之最近消息、日方軍事當道雖密切注視方部行動、但暫時將束手旁觀、聞方部現向西進行、其用意味悉、迨進至政府軍所守之休戰線時、是否將遭攻擊、抑被繳械、仍屬疑問、（二十七日路透電）</p>

<p>昌黎二十七日昌城較平靜、惟謠言甚盛、上午有日兵二十餘名、在昌各處偵察、逗遛甚久始去、據傳一部散匪、距城僅十餘里、但人數甚微、不足爲患、日來昌城不肖分子、頗有某種企圖、且暗行派員赴秦秘密活動、日內如無妥實辦法、情勢頗爲可慮、連日街市冷落、富有者均已西去、商店大半閉門、當局已通飭照常開板、且嚴禁移運貨物、用以安定人心、同時並抽調鄉團、嚴密聯防、援隊到昌即再復撫城、該處現有匪約兩千名、歸郭亞洲指揮、張魁元聞尙在津、向某方連絡、共圖大舉、另據報、遷安方面忽發現軍裝整齊之土匪百餘名、來源不詳、留守營已被佔、但北寗通車照常、（二十七日電電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>華北風雲梓</h3>
<p>塘沽簽約大連集議以後。更繼之察局之和平解决。華北局面。始獲暫告安定。此安定之局面。由若何重大之代價得來。爲另一問題。惟在無可奈何之形勢下。得偷安以度和平之生活。則固華北人民之所認爲徼倖者也。乃馮玉祥離察後不及一月。而灤東之匪勢大張。北平當局方求日方諒解。以謀肅清匪氛。而二十日方振武軍突入懷柔。吉鴻昌等繼之。平北又形吃緊。二十三日日飛機且重蒞北平矣。據日來傳自北方各消息。老耗子郭亞洲諸匪之揭東亞同盟聯合軍旗幟而活躍。方吉各軍之圖五路窺平津。其背後均有日人之關係。以是風雲一起。舉國惶然。固不僅身處華北者之憂慮大難臨頭也。</p>
<p>日本目前之窺伺平津。與去秋之窺伺熱河。手段雖不同。情形則極相類似。惟其所希望之外交上收穫。尙有大於平津之佔領者。故一般人所恐懼之華北大變動。在日人外交上希望未斷絶以前。似不致實現。試觀今日電訊。灤東勦匪。柴山已承認中國派保安隊爲恊定所許。且言儘可多派矣。非武裝區域中方吉各軍。已被迫南移。日飛機更施以轟炸。俾不能東趨與灤東匪軍會合矣。凡此皆與日本之外交活動有關。吾人固不能認爲華北風雲。可由此轉緩。亦不能謂日本態度較前良好。吾人所注意者。乃此一緊一緩之後面所具之重大意義耳。北方新聞界明乎此。以親遭危難之故。風雲一起。即要求「當局以國士風度任天下之重。堂堂正正。披瀝誠悃。與日本相周旋。防止現狀之惡化。」此其所見。極爲明澈。蓋倘有方術以使日本不爲幕後之主持。則老耗子郭亞洲烏合之衆。方振武吉鴻昌孤立之軍。不特不足以危害華北。即肅清解决。亦不甚難。然於此有問題發生。即欲使日本不爲此。必出相當之代價。當局其能以極小代價而二次安定華北乎。</p>
<p>總之。此次華北風雲。其所見於表面者。殊易了結。問題中心。全在外交。當局倘能知所自處。從外交謀解决。而不以全國痛心之事爲外交解决之代價。庶不負華北輿論界之苦心也。</p>

<p>陳氏家庭景况、據馬等云、陳先生向不事產業、勤儉刻苦、爲其守身之戒條、亦爲其對子女之庭訓、自下野後、初在港租屋居住、後家景每况愈下、在其弟寓分其居、今觀其死後、别無長物、惟大堆之書籍耳、先生現年五十七歲、遺下一老母、一妻、五女、三子、妻黃氏、爲一鄉村舊式女子、先生雖嘗爲權貴、未嘗納妾也、長子定夏、十七歲、在滬大同大學附中肄業、經電其即回港、次子定炎、十一歲、三子定炳、九歲、均在本港嶺南分校肄業、女五、長女（今年三十四歲）、三女四女均已嫁人、大女寶瑤、二女璧瑤、三女瑞瑤、四女淑瑤、五女美瑤、第二第五兩女現尙在聖士提反女校肄業、諸女均居長、先生尙有年已八十三歲之老母楊氏、今仍健存也、</p>
<p>馬等又云、陳先生自通電下野後、仍組黨討赤、以致心力俱瘁、去年曾一度赴津、未幾即旋港、外間乃有勾結强暴之謠、不知先生生平事蹟、爲功爲罪、後世史乘、當有公平之論斷、但其不害國、不賣國之心、固未後人也云云、（二十三日）</p>

<h3>蔣作賓昨來滬談話</h3>
<p>一週內東渡回任</p>
<p>中日僵局之打開責在日方</p>
<p>駐華日使無輕易更動之理</p>
<p>駐日公使蔣作賓、奉命即日回任、於前晚出京、昨晨過蘇州下車、料理私務、昨日下午二時半抵滬、本報記者、昨特訪晤、之於寓次蔣氏謂一週內乘輪東渡、中日問題之僵局能否打開、完全以日方爲轉移、茲分誌其談話如下、</p>
<h3>一週內東渡</h3>
<p>蔣氏首謂、本人病體、現已全愈、在滬候輪東渡、確期尙未定、大約在一週內、當可成行、秘書丁紹笈現尙以私事留平、不日南下、同行赴日、外傳駐日使館擴充說、非事實、僅外部人員略事調動而已、</p>
<h3>日外相廣田</h3>
<p>記者詢新任日外相廣田、其爲人及政策如何、蔣謂、日外相廣田、與我黨國要人、頗多知交、對於我國情形、亦極熟悉、但欲求其於外交方面、脫離軍人之主張、打開牽制之局、殊爲不可能之事實也、</p>
<h3>中日之僵局</h3>
<p>記者復叩以中日問題之僵局、在短時期內、究竟有無打開之可能、蔣氏以毫不遲疑之口吻、答謂、中日僵局能打開與否、此全在日本而不在中國、蓋日爲侵略國家、苟日方能眞正覺晤、認清事實、僵局即有打開之可能、否則終無辦法也、蔣氏又稱、駐華日使有吉明、日政府倚畀正殷、無輕易更動之理、外傳有田使華說、並非事實、</p>
<h3>將訪晤黃郛</h3>
<p>蔣氏復謂、來滬尙未與北平政委會委員長黃膺白會晤、擬明日（今日）往訪、蔣氏對方振武吉鴻昌等部在華北發生異動、予日人以口實、假借愛國名義、實行自相殘殺、言下不勝感慨、又蔣氏昨晨在蘇州、係訪良石工唐伯泉爲其先太夫人治墓誌銘云</p>
<h3>黃紹雄談西北視察觀感</h3>
<p>晋省積極從事建設</p>
<p>昨分訪宋子文黃郛</p>
<p>內政部長黃紹雄、前赴西北視察、遍歷晋綏等省、旋又赴贛、晋謁蔣委員長報告一切、業於昨晨由京乘夜快車抵滬、昨日下午、分訪財政部長宋子文·及黃郛、復接見各報社記者、茲記其談話如次、</p>
<h3>晋省建設頗具成績</h3>
<p>據黃氏談、余此次由京過平轉晋、在太原小作勾留、閻百川（錫山）先生、刻頗努力於建設事業、省府設有經濟統制處、與財政整理處、經濟統制處、專司經濟建設工作、將兵工廠改爲製造廠、自製各類布疋等必需品、更試製木炭汽車、刻已完成四輛、頗可應用、能載重作長途行駛、是以一切建設、實大有可觀、再財政整理處職掌財政整理、晋省幣制、原甚複雜、兼之財政管理、又不統一、故有該處之設、藉資規劃整理、</p>
<h3>閻氏意旨一秉中央</h3>
<p>繼謂、閻先生態度、頗爲安靜、余在太原、曾與晤及、渠近專事建設晋省、似不欲多與聞國家大計、但其意旨、則一秉中央、凡晋省一切行政、均以中央意旨爲意旨、余離太原後即入綏、在綏勾留頗久、但未及包頭即返、綏遠交通尙稱便利、平綏路車過南口時、其行駛速率則甚緩、因該處前爲奉直戰事所毀、刻下雖已修復、但尙未盡完好耳</p>
<h3>綏遠秩序尙稱安定</h3>
<p>至於綏遠秩序、尙稱安定、軍事政治諸方面、均無混亂現象、孫殿英所部、本奉命開赴青海屯墾、且已領得相當開拔費、但目下仍滯留綏邊包頭、尙未逕入青省、</p>
<h3>物產豐富缺乏人才</h3>
<p>黃氏繼談、晋綏兩省、物產均極豐富、晋省煤礦尤多、綏遠則多農產、如甜菜·馬鈴薯等、出產極豐、甜菜可用以製糖、馬鈴薯可用以製澱粉、兩者兼可附產酒精、且該省適宜畜牧、羊毛·牛皮·出口甚鉅、該省每人每年祇須六元、即可過活、生活程度之低、於此可見、惜物產雖豐、而缺乏人才、無人工固不能開發、無錢財又何從利用、</p>
<h3>方吉崛起不無影響</h3>
<p>最後記者詢以戰區接收後情形、據稱、華北戰區、大部雖已接收、但尙有數處、如榆關等地、日軍終未全撤、此次方（振武）吉（鴻昌）崛起、又將影響戰區接收問題、據平電傳方吉不足慮、惟背景可憂、此說似非無因、黃氏並謂、余赴潯謁蔣委員長、完全　告視察經過、並無其他任務、在滬勾留一二日回京云、</p>
<h3>赴蒙未定分訪宋黃</h3>
<p>又關於內蒙王公宣布自治後、中央决派黃氏及蒙藏委員會委員白雲梯兩氏、指導自治一事、據黃氏表示、行期尙未有定、黃氏到滬後、上午在寓休息、午後三時許、首往西愛咸斯路五零一號、晋晤財政部長宋子文、談約五十分鐘始辭出、旋即轉至祈齊路訪駐平政務委員長黃郛氏、談有一小時、據黃氏云、訪宋黃晤談、係因久未見面、略有報告、惟聞黃氏來滬、係商處置華北問題、代中央促黃氏早日北上主政云、</p>
<h3>英使昨日抵滬</h3>
<p>日內晋京向我當局辭行</p>
<p>英公使藍溥森、奉英政府命令、調充駐埃及蘇丹高等委員、即將卸任赴埃履新、故特於昨晨偕使館參贊台克滿、館員史各脫、搭中國航空公司飛機離平、於午後三時四十分抵龍華飛機塲、本埠英領事及英商會長馬錫爾等、均往歡迎、藍氏到滬後、即於下午五時許、至外灘華懋飯店休息、藍使在滬、約有一星期逗留、然後入京、向我外部辭行、</p>
<h3>法使韋禮德已入京</h3>
<p>法飛行家不來滬</p>
<p>新聲社云、法領署昨晨否認法國公使韋禮德在滬、謂已於二十五日晚乘車入京、　法飛行家現正計劃飛行日本、然後經西比利亞回歐、並不來滬、報載將於二十八日由海參威來滬說、不確、</p>
<h3>昨晨瑞典親王赴港</h3>
<p>瑞典卡爾親王、此次來華遊歷、於上月底抵滬後、曾過京赴平一行、倍受各地之歡迎、卡爾氏業於本月中旬由平返此、略事休息、即於昨晨乘日本皇后號輪赴港海關特備鏡光小輪專送登輪、在埠歡送者、有吳市長代表唐士煊·外交部駐滬辦事處處長余銘·科長趙鐵章·並瑞典代理總領事赫德門·司高夫·諸氏、聞卡爾氏將在香港稍事遊歷、再行返歐、</p>
<h3>法總領昨訪吳市長</h3>
<p>面商解决海格路警權問題</p>
<p>駐滬法國總領事梅理藹氏、於昨晨十時、趨車往楓林橋市政府、訪晤市長吳鐵城、當由吳市長親自延見、至將近十一時始辭出、據聞梅氏與吳市長所談者、係中法交界之海格路警權問題、蓋此事雖由市府　法總領館曾一度提出書面交涉、但法總領所予答復、未能使市府滿意、故法總領特往市府、與吳市長面商解决辦法、</p>
<h3>殷汝耕昨謁黃郛報告華北情形</h3>
<p>新聲社云、華北戰區接收委員殷汝耕氏、於昨日上午十一時許、往謁黃膺白氏報告華北最近情形、據殷氏語記者、黃氏擬於本月底前後返平、但離滬確定時日、尙未决定、本人則俟黃氏離滬後再北上、外傳黃氏消極說、實非事實、至華北戰區、除長城外數縣、本已接收完畢、然因近日華北時局、則又與以前不同、（按此語係指平北灤東經方吉老耗子等擾亂後日軍又藉口進駐）至長城以外各縣之接收問題、照停戰恊定之規定、日兵須退至長城、故接收略感棘手然以河北省界線而論、並非以長城綫爲界、故日軍依停戰協定、雖祇退至長城綫爲止、然長城外各縣、其行政則仍將由我方行使、故此事當再續商也、又殷氏於昨日下午三時許、往訪蔣作賓、有所晤談、</p>
<h3>繆鍾秀述美國絲業情形</h3>
<p>日奪華絲在美市塲</p>
<p>海外貿易亟應改良</p>
<p>實業部商品檢騐局生　處主任繆鍾秀、於本年五月初旬、應絲業團體之推請赴美考察絲業情形、業于前日返國、昨日繆氏發表此行觀感、詳述華紗銷美失敗原因、茲分述如下、</p>
<h3>美絲織業逐漸恢復</h3>
<p>美國絲織業、前數年中、受不景氣之影響、經濟情形、異常竭蹶、而以巨大廠家、所受打擊尤甚、以故均將範圍縮小賴銀行之維持、得延殘喘、近一年內、逐漸恢復、最近因政府實施經濟復興運動後、絲綢商店、因恐物價猛漲、銷路轉旺、相率定貨、各廠驟形活動、一若一九一九年前之繁華者、惜乎此係暫時之興奮、商店定貨是否能銷售無遺、繼續添辦、仍爲問題也、</p>
<h3>美婦女喜用人造絲</h3>
<p>美國人造絲之銷售、在一二年內非常暢旺、考其原因、不外價格低廉、品質齊整、此外人造絲廠推銷得力、亦一大原因、其推銷方法、由團體設計、以人造絲織品製成衣飾、陳列宣傳、各廠出售貨品後、再派技術人員、往銷用廠家、指導用法、故近兩年來、銷用人造絲之綢廠、日益增加、且美國人民、購買力减少後、婦女但求衣服美觀、價格低廉、不問其原料是否眞絲、是否耐久、絲綢廠祗求出品易銷、有利可圖、不問所用原料爲眞絲、抑爲人造絲、大槪銷用人造絲、以綢廠爲最多、甚或十分之七原料爲人造絲、其次銷用者爲絲襪廠、至襪廠銷用量則甚微少、</p>
<h3>提倡生絲不遺餘力</h3>
<p>美國絲織業、大别之可分絲綢廠、絲襪廠、絲線廠、各廠出品不同、日本製絲業日益進步、高級出品亦隨之增加、美國絲織業、亦提高採用生絲、故生絲前途、决不致受人造絲之傾軋而銷减、蓋生絲自有其特點、非人造絲可得替代也、</p>
<h3>華絲銷美失敗原因</h3>
<p>至華絲銷美之失敗、就其原因之重要分述如左、（一）華絲銷美、向假外人之手、數年前雖有經營生絲之華商數家、但均無人在海外直接推銷、僅委託外人代表銷售、而銷售是否得力、購買者之經濟能力是否可靠、無從探悉、一經打擊、遂相率停業、今卓然獨立者、惟通運一家耳、銷售華絲、假手洋商、不特美國絲織業之進步及需要不能明悉、即推銷亦復不力、近來推銷生絲、已成爲一種專門服務、不可以銷售其他生絲同一視之也、推銷生絲、須先察其需要、對于品質、尤須使購者有深切之信任、然後舉以求售、再以源源不絶之貨物供其應用、（二）品質上以直繅爲最不合用之要點、次之爲均匀、華絲以絲分細微且女工習于注重條份均匀、此層希望負改良蠶絲者、特别注意、萬勿因减低成本、而採用絲分粗巨之品、失去華絲之特質、（三）價格一層、均匀好者、售價太高、襪廠聞而生畏、低次者美國市塲又不能與同級日絲得相等價格、（四）缺乏現貨、亦一重要原因、美國絲業自受打擊後、經濟力薄弱、不能訂購期貨、且花樣時變、配置原料、不能預定、是以期貨銷路、不如往年之多、而日絲在美國市塲、則絲甚存多隨購隨得、即有期貨不合時、亦得隨時掉換、非如華絲不合時、除割價退還外、無法解决也、</p>
<h3>絲業協會我已加入</h3>
<p>美國人士對我國感情較好、若能校正上述四點、華絲前途、希望甚大、最近紐約絲商已組織國際絲業恊會、進行生絲宣傳、與人造絲抗衡、日意法各國均已加入、我國方面、該會已電請永泰絲廠經理薛壽萱君、國際貿易局長何炳賢氏、加入爲名譽會員、下月在巴黎舉行之國際絲業會議、我國未能參加、殊爲可惜云、</p>

<h3>英國惠勃爾登世界網球大會日記（十一）</h3>
<p>倫敦特約通信一志寄</p>
<p>七月七日（星期五）續</p>
<p>梵恩斯以六比四勝第一盤、已如上述、但實際應以六比二得勝、蓋旣破克勞福之發球成五比二、錯誤毫無、而克勞福此局最後一記爲發球雙誤、梵恩斯前途、希望無窮、雖然、克勞福並不如此而了、亦破梵之發球、繼又勝其自己發球之局、梵恩斯時時觸網、又次一局、梵第一記發球、又送入網內且、成發球雙誤、幸梵仍勝此局、成六比四、克勞福以一極易之抽球、擊入網內、奉送此最後一分、</p>
<p>第二盤一連十九局、發球者皆得勝、梵之發球得勝、較克更易、梵時時有突破對方之勢、但皆爲克所擊回、發球第一記卽得分者更不可計、克勞福成四比三佔先時、曾有一次、其次一局、梵亦一下而中、但爲足誤而廢、重發一下、仍然得分、兩人幾無上網之戰略、第九局似乎梵可擊破而前進、但克勞福又擊退之、克向梵之反手攻擊、然梵堅不爲動、兩人之正手、皆爲雙方致命之傷、重而速、發球得分、又使梵戰成各五、其次一局、克勞福連連錯誤、零－三十、十五－四十、然梵之一抽觸網、一擊出界、克勞福頓時又獲生路、猛烈進攻、使梵不得不用高球以禦、平等之後、梵些微之差、克遂獲勝、其次一局、梵連發三記、連得三分、直至成九比九、無甚變化、雙方皆表演奇佳、克勞福勝十比九、於是梵之厄運發見、克以觸帶球先勝一分、梵以三十－十五佔先、克於平等之後、又佔先一記、梵再觸網、克勞福乃以十一比九勝此寶貴之第二盤、此光榮之第二盤、每一分幾乎皆有劇戰、克勞福之球、平穩而堅實、梵之步法較佳、但錯誤則多、克勞福回答發球、更特殊可驚、</p>
<p>第三盤梵以二比三落後、又成零－四十、旣平等之、仍以錯誤而失、克勞福節節前進、以六比二再勝、</p>
<p>第四盤鮮可記述、克勞福勝第一局後、梵漸見回復原狀、生氣蓬勃、發球旣重、抽球又佳、大佔上風、克錯誤之多、出乎意外、全站於守衛線內、五比二梵又得勝其自己發球之一局、</p>
<p>第五盤之最先四局、發球者皆　意得勝、各二後、梵恩斯之機會來矣、因克勞福之錯誤、梵於平等復佔先一記、又上網而得勝之、復次一局、梵失誤一極難擊之空中壓球、克勞福以猛烈發球、奪回之、此時陽光漸爲雲蔽、　度漸减、次局克勞福於三十－四十落後之後、而得勝成四比三、梵恩斯又連發三球、連得三分、加以一抽、比　再成平手、克勞福於二次危局中、得渡難關、一般人之意見、皆傾向於克之勝利、克果又勝其發球局成五比四、梵恩斯發球、第一第二有記發球、皆被擊回、梵依樣葫蘆、兩記皆送上網內、梵頓受一驚、前衝上網、克下一妙抽、恰巧　擊而過、已成零－四十、梵發球錯誤、再發、克一擊而回、一幕大戰、在梵之再度觸網、而告終畢、</p>
<p>英王英后未曾蒞臨、但皇族特别　則告滿、西班牙前王阿爾方沙最受注目、此外則有各國公使、裁判員勃洛在終局後、坐於場之一端、口　雪茄、若準備對付意外事故者然、</p>
<p>諾納不如克拉姆遠甚、佐藤布井則表演奇佳、旣勝潘萊休斯、此德國組似乎將不堪其一擊、然比賽結果、最先三盤、劇戰甚烈、精彩殊多、諾納出手敏速、銳角　球甚　、穿上網、一有機會、卽施用其拍、其弱點爲求勝心太切而造成之不少錯誤、如果克拉姆能更出之鄭重及自信更强、諾納可更得力、第一盤二人或造成平等數次、奪得第二盤、第三盤　　　　佐藤布井則已竭盡其精彩、</p>
<p>傑姆斯奧　　　　　　　　　　利與米克爾兩夫人終而勝之、比　於第一場舉行、殊爲觀者欣賞、傑約一組更其爲傑姆斯女士、年青、求勝心切、亦善奔走、使對方　於奔命、以光盤勝第二盤、第三盤四比四而六比四得勝、高弗列夫人仍最漂亮、擊法可觀、米克爾夫人之輔佐、亦甚得力、惟傑約兩人之壓球猛烈、終於屈服耳、此塲原定在中央塲舉行、復於七時三十分移往第一塲、比賽異常有味、觀者直至八時三十分而去、</p>
<p>畢德門與列特雷兩夫人今日値得一提、在中央場對蘭英及瑪底歐夫人、上場失利、奪得第二盤、第三盤力戰而敗、蘭英女士與畢德門夫人善壓球、其餘二人則善底線抽擊、壓球者則守於網前、準備重擊、瑪底歐與列特雷則各作深遠之抽球、有時加以高球、此種擊法、甚易感單調、但以戰略不差、亦甚有味、蘭英女士瑪底、歐夫人仍按理得勝、第三盤六比四、</p>
<p>混合雙打中之一場特殊比賽爲希蘭女士與法瓜生擊敗納脫霍女士與鮑羅屈拉、失敗者、表演最佳時、勝於希法、惜錯誤太多耳、希蘭最佳、全爲一九三二年英國第一名選手之氣槪、法瓜與鮑羅屈拉相仿彿、求勝皆切、擊球過重、錯誤亦隨之增漲矣、</p>

<h3>租界內嗣後新建築務宜加高基址</h3>
<p>鑒於上次風潮爲害</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、日前浦江潮水登岸時、浸水最深地方、皆在大建築物附近、如浦灘江海關及匯豐銀行附近、江西路工部局四周、南京路先施永安兩公司附近、莫不水可逾膝、昨曾有人根據此種現象向工部局公共工程處人員提出意見、以爲此等地方之低陷、由於大建築物壓力過重所致、但工程處人員則謂此等地方、在三十年前、本爲低窪之區、卽目下並未建有大建築物地方亦不乏與其同樣低窪者、大建築物之下陷、固不免使地勢益形低窪、但以目下打椿知識之進步、新造大建築物、已不若舊建者下陷之甚、故將來大規模之建築、當不致使、本埠更易有潮汐氾濫之虞也、此外更有認多數自流井吸去地中積水後、易使地層低陷、但某專家反對此說、謂據渠所有印象、似本埠地形在若干年來略見高漲、猶憶一九零五年九月一日颶風大潮時、浦灘浸水之深、曾有一舢板吹入公共租界中區之中點、惟潮水登岸片時、雖不致損及屋基、但爲免除種種不便利起見、嗣後新建築宜加高基址、俾地形較低、各馬路亦可逐漸塡高云、</p>
<h3>投標商號希圖朦混路局</h3>
<p>紅雞牌漂布確係日貨</p>
<p>棉布公會已去函證明</p>
<p>和平社云、京滬滬杭甬兩路局爲購置客車檯布材料、曾經招商投標、近由本市某商號得標、據人告密、謂該號所投布料爲日貨、該局局長黃伯樵、爲欲明瞭眞相起見、函送小樣布一方、請本市棉布公會檢定、該會以紅雞牌漂布確係日貨、但原樣過小、難於鑑别、囑送原疋大樣再行檢定認眞、該號以局方澈查、難於隱瞞、遂將英商泰和洋行經售之金虎牌之英布、送由該會、再函棉布公會鑑定、於是撲朔迷離之日英布料掉包案、遂得大白、茲由和平社記者、將雙方各函、摘錄於下、</p>
<h3>路局來函</h3>
<p>京滬滬杭甬路局致棉布公會函云、本路局標購客車檯布材料、已由本埠某號得標、惟據該號所投布料係愛培洋行經售紅雞牌日貨、茲爲考查明確起見、據請貴會予以鑑定、俾資識别、相應檢同上項材料、樣布一方、備函附逹、至希查照惠覆爲荷、又該局續函云、接准台函、以前送樣布過小、囑換原疋大樣、俾資鑑定等由、經飭據原商號檢來金虎牌樣布一疋、該樣布是否與前送小樣布、爲同樣之布、又金虎牌是否係日貨、統請貴會賜予鑑定、以憑核辦、相應檢同前送小樣布一塊、及金虎牌樣布一疋、再函奉逹、至希查照惠覆爲荷、</p>
<h3>棉業復函</h3>
<p>逕啟者、接准大函、並附下布樣一方、承囑鑑定見覆等由、敝會審察來樣確多可疑、惟以原樣過小、鑑别爲難、擬請貴局飭令將標商號呈繳原疋大樣、如果竟爲愛培洋行所經售之紅雞牌、則固確係日貨、否則一經比對、亦不難水落石出也、又該會續函云、接准大函、並附下金虎牌漂布一疋、小樣一方、承囑代爲鑑定、是否相符、與金虎牌是否日貨、等由准此、查金虎牌漂布、確係英商泰和洋行出品、並非日貨、但與前送之小樣相較、則質地色澤原料、均各完全不同、相應檢還大原樣、備函奉覆、至希察核爲荷、</p>
<h3>長江航輪漸見起色</h3>
<p>日貨進出均擁擠</p>
<p>停航江輪議復班</p>
<p>今年長江航輪、最爲不振、前月滬上六公司以營業銳落、各减少船舶、致招商·三北·太古·怡和·同時抽停班次、以冀減省損失、近來長江方面劣貨輸入、與中國土貨原料之輸出至東洋者、日益起色、而各地之轉口貨與本街之運赴長江貨、亦比較前兩月稍稍起色、各公司已停之輪、遂有復航之舉、亟將近情、查誌如下、</p>
<h3>進出貨槪况</h3>
<p>本年自一月分起、至八月底止、長江各埠（除上海口岸外）之輸入貨物、總計値五千一百二十八萬九千元、以較去年同一時期之輸入長江口岸者、則減少九百六十二萬九千元之進口貨、至於出口貨物、在此八個月中、近因運日貨擁擠、共値三千六百七十四萬元、而較去歲同時、則增加七百四十七萬二千元、</p>
<h3>劣貨漸增多</h3>
<p>長江方面之劣貨、在此兩個月內、逐漸增加、近頃由日本運入上海轉到漢口等埠者、日郵社每一輪船、由東洋到滬、恒有三四百噸轉往、其中以海產品·東洋糖·亚棉織品·紙頭·雜貨·等爲多、該項貨物、統由日清江輪轉載者、近海社又派日本長江之直放輪、至於我國貨物運赴東洋、其擁擠爲近所罕見、甚至裝貨噸位、須預先商定、若臨時往裝、竟至無以應命、其去貨以麩皮·雜糧·等頂爲多、近除日郵社七船專航外、三井·昭和·等均有長江日本班輪行駛、</p>
<h3>滬漢貨復興</h3>
<p>從本月份起、六公司之長江班輪、經上次會商整頓、統一水脚、並交換各船裝貨艙單、以泯除互相競爭而濫放扣用以後、進出口貨營業、均漸上軌道、而九個九五回佣等之不規則的放盤、亦已消滅、近來太古怡和之長江各輪、因轉船貨增多、較前兩月爲佳、各船往來、可以維持開支而不致損失矣、招商局之本街長江去貨、今年獨佳、幾每船可以裝足、近來且有貨多船少、不敷需求之勢、擬向怡和購買聯和輪以資擴張、旋以船價不合、事未實現、三北之長江輪、得沈仲毅主持後、營業亦殊不弱、刻下去貨比較前兩月、平均可增百分之二十以上、營業漸次有復興之望、</p>
<h3>各商船復航</h3>
<p>太古·怡和·招商·三北·等、在前月因營業清淡、而停班之船、茲因進出口客貨、已漸見發動、各公司又復會議、以當時爲船多貨少而停航者、但各公司減班以後、一般野鷄船、竟乘此機會、添航長江輪、以頂代各公司減班之空期、而更將運費濫跌、使停船者未獲、減班之效、轉爲野鷄船造開行長江班輪之機會、故與其無益之久停、不如恢復行駛、尙可收回一部分被奪之營業也、此事已在討論中、大致前停各船、不久可望復班行駛、</p>
<h3>市中心區裝置消防龍頭</h3>
<p>公安局擬定計劃</p>
<p>呈請市政府核准</p>
<p>市中心區之給水問題、業已解决、閘北水電公司已在三民路府北內路國和路等處埋設水管、惟消防龍頭一項、係清道取水所必需、亦爲消防之必要設備、市公安局有鑒於此、特派員會同閘北救火會前往三民路等處詳細查勘、在埋水管之各重要幹路上詳細規劃、第一期擬定裝置消防龍頭十九具、聞此項計劃、已由該局呈請市府核准、</p>

<h3>土布與美德</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>中國有大布之衣大帛之冠的韓文公，印度有終身自紡土紗自織土布的大偉人甘地，古今中外最値得景仰値得禮讚的，無過於穿着布衣的人了。我們小時，守着「布衣暖，菜飯飽」的主義，穿了我母親自紡自織自裁的布衣裳，簇簇新新的穿在身上，心中說不出的快活。「慈母手中綫；游子身上衣。」我的舊篋中，藏着一二件土布短衫，還是二十年前我老母手製的，破了又補，補了又穿，我妻替我做了不少的短衫，可是外邊買的布，總不及我老母自紡自織的經穿。我之信仰土布，便在這個地方。猶記得我小時，在一燈熒熒的小燈光下，我讀書，母織布，書聲和機聲是相應成趣的。書讀熟了，母親替我快活，布織好了，我替母親快活，並且自己也快活，因爲丰染好以後，我又得穿一件簇簇新新的土布長衫了。我還記得我母親有一隻箱子中，都放着齊齊整整的衣服，平常時候，不肯輕易穿着，她說這是我十餘年前的嫁衣裳，在那待字閨中時，便跟着你的外祖母自紡自織的。我那時感激至於無極。我還記得，我九歲訂婚時候，除了四隻小銀錠以外，還有綠布八疋作爲文定禮，也是我母親的成績。今年無意中檢到兩塊綠布包袱，我妻說這便是當初文定時候的綠布做成的，一些不破，一些不壞。這是多麽寶貴，多麽値得紀念呢。吾上面的一段話，便是證明土布的經穿，和當初家庭的美德。無論如何，這種好風氣，不但不應該打倒，還得要提倡。如果人人家裏依舊有自紡自織的土布，我想一年之中，至少要增加幾千萬萬的生產力。我覺得中國人，尤其是上海人太時髦了，一個人穿了布衣，不是看不起他便是笑他土氣，稱他土頭土腦，所以徧中國之大，智識階級中人，不很多穿着布衣的，我就朋友中所知道的舉出二個人，一位是四川甘地盧作孚，一位是湖南甘地部爽秋，盧先生是實業家，郚先生是敎育家，他們有一種堅强的意志，隨便到這麽地方，總是保持他們土布服裝的尊嚴，眞是可敬可佩。土布運動，不是空呐喊，也不是出鋒頭，爲的是救風俗，救亡，救貧，救農村，救家庭。這次張鳳山先生等發起的土布大會，尤其有重大的意義。因爲上海人太摩登化了，一衣數十金，一料數百金，做丈夫的，只要博愛妻的歡心，做母親的，只要得小姐的快樂儘有棄了自己很好的棉布，。去買那東洋布·俄國花標·印度紗·歐美縐，來穿着的。附近地方，沾染這種風氣，公子哥兒鄉下大姐幾乎被上海人同化下去，尤其是十分危險的一件事。現在我們趁此機會，來大大的鼓吹一番，宣傳一番，使一般人知道一向認爲二百五的土布，居然有不少可取之處，居然很多勝過舶來布的地方。或者於挽回利權上，有不少功績。儘管人家說你二百五，你們還是趕這二百五的工作，我很佩服發起諸君的熱心，承他們幾次要我說幾句話，我便隨便的貢獻一些。</p>
<h3>提倡土布的五個理由</h3>
<p>— 張翼</p>
<p>在科學昌明的現代，機織品日新月異，生產量也年有增進，一般人還是高唱着提倡土布，這簡直不近人情，一定是時代的落伍者。</p>
<p>不－話不是這樣說的，機織品當然要提倡，農民手造的土布，也應當提倡，我們决不可以爲工人爭飯，而不爲農民維生，當此提倡土布聲浪中，稍具有愛國心明瞭社會國家狀况的人們，决不敢說土布不應當提倡。</p>
<p>在下也是個主張提倡土布，救濟農村的人，姑把我的理由，寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）織造土布，是農家的主要副業，</p>
<p>在我國四萬七千萬人羣中，至少有三萬九千九百五十萬人是農民，農民中間，至少有一萬一千九百八十五萬人是依織爲活者，我們要維持這一萬萬以上的同胞有飯吃，我們不得不呼號奔走地來提倡土布，所以提倡土布，是復興農村的一件工作。</p>
<p>（二）帝國主義者經濟侵略之手段，有加無已，外貨傾入，廠商已收莫大之損失，土布行銷，所受打擊更大，我國實業，至爲危險，國本攸關，豈能小視，提倡國貨爲救國之要道，然今之所謂國貨者，取材外洋，十居六七，或竟取人熟貨，改標更裝，以僞亂眞，滋爲可痛－土布以土棉土紗織造，其爲國貨，毫無疑義－故提倡土布，抵制洋布，實爲救國重要工作。</p>
<p>（三）農村不安定，實予匪共以可乘之機，我國農村現狀，已十室九空，乞食求救，已爲報紙恒有之記錄其於建國訓政，固多妨碍，考農村之不能安定，一由於生產量的减少，一由於土產品的賠償。非有副業以補助他，全國農村破產，即在目前，續佑爲農村固有副業，理應助其發展，裕足農民，所以提倡土布，是一種安定農村的工作。</p>
<p>（四）自海禁開通　後，風俗日趨侈糜，服裝花式，爭奇鬥異，復多取材於舶來，不特金錢流失，即現社會種種惡態，大都以是而起，土布樸實儉雅，製爲服裝，有高尙氣度，用爲帘幕，具古樸淳風，京滬女學生之所以首先服用土布，就是這個原因，可見提倡土布，是挽救頽風的一種工作。</p>
<p>（五）我國生產落後，國民經濟，漸入山窮水盡的地步，要維持現狀，漸國興復，崇尙節約，也是一種重要的方法，土布價廉耐用，爲最經濟的衣料，如果人人服用，那麽在不知不覺之中，節約不少財力，積儲許多資金。因是知提倡土布，是節約國民經濟的一種積極方法，綜上五項，可知土布的提倡，不容或緩，甚望社會熱心人士，羣起倡導，以盡一分利民固國的任務吧！</p>
<h3>我的服用土布談</h3>
<p>— 姚惠泉</p>
<p>我是一個十足道地的農家子，記得從有知一直到十四歲小學畢業，全身穿的没有一樣不是老土布，那時候我家的老土布是：</p>
<p>自己田裏產的棉花，</p>
<p>自己廠裏軋的花衣；</p>
<p>母嫂手裏彈的鬆花；</p>
<p>祖母手裏搓的棉條；</p>
<p>家裏婦女紡的棉紗；</p>
<p>母嫂手裏織的老布；</p>
<p>鄉間染坊染的土色；</p>
<p>確是十足道地的國貨，而且還是「土貨」「家貨」。那時候我的左鄰右舍，親戚朋友的家裏，如果穿起棉織品來，没有一家不是這樣的。有一次，我的叔叔結婚，可說是盛極一時，來的賓客，穿紅着綠，非本國的綢緞，即「家貨」的老布，簡直找不出一件外國貨來。那幾天，我所穿的是一件老藍布夾袍，外罩黑布夾馬褂，足上是黑布襪，黑布鞋，頭上是小緞帽，在鏡子中自己照照，眞是漂乎其亮了。這是我完全服用「家貨」的老土布時期。</p>
<p>我小學畢業的明年，居然當了一個鄉村小學校長，在採辦書籍文具等等的時候，不免到上海走動走動，耳濡目染，於是帝國主義的經濟侵略，也開始到我身上來了，荷蘭的白竹布短衫褲，大英（那時的稱謂）的白羽毛紗長衫，迦門（即德國）的鷹球牌線襪，一件件，一樣樣，在我身上發現。一直到進師範讀書，畢業後，再當市立學校敎員校長，做敎育行政人員，於是逐漸進步（？）到穿嗶嘰長衫，直貢呢馬褂，大英皮鞋，意大利呢帽；而到全身舶來品的西裝。直到五卅慘案爲止，計算我貢獻於洋大人的，十年中間恐怕要近千元吧！實在的，那時候，腦裏邊充滿了只要「漂亮」就算，並没有什麽「國貨」「非國貨」的觀念，這是我服用洋貨時期。</p>
<p>因五卅慘案的一刺激，愛國思想大爲發逹，我就停止添辦洋貨西裝，逐漸的穿起國貨綢緞中裝來，實在還脫不了「漂亮」二字的觀念。十六年革命軍到滬後，看見各地一般黨同志和敎育界同人們，多穿着洋貨的服裝，心上已覺得大不以爲然。「九一八」事變突起，我隨着我所信仰的人士，奔走呼號，謀救濟國難的途徑，認爲在我們手無縛鷄之力的，只有以身作則，對東北義軍作物質上的接濟，及精神上的援助，所以我就節衣縮食的省下錢來積極的捐助，並與家人們立下三條公約：</p>
<p>（一）不進戲館影戲館游戲塲－賭博跳舞本來無緣。</p>
<p>（二）婚喪喜慶的送禮，至多以二元爲限。</p>
<p>（三）服裝一律用「家貨」的土布。</p>
<p>一方面竭力向親友間擴大我們的主張。尤其在上海幾次很闊綽的喜慶宴會中，我穿着土布的袍褂，我的夫人穿着土布的旗袍，我的長次二兒穿着土布的童裝，從容地活潑地，周旋於一般摩登男女之間，眞被我們感動得不少！</p>
<p>到「一二八」滬變之前，跟着我們走的親友，已經很多。滬變時，我辦理十九路軍的接濟工作，穿着土布服裝，坐着汽車，奔馳上海眞如和前綫之間，更受親友們的注意，只要同我關係較深的親友，那可保證，所服用的，絶對不買外國貨，穿土布覺得「土頭土腦」的觀念，完全改轉來而自己也穿起來了。這一筆省下的錢，連同一切花粉胭脂飲食之類，着實可觀。</p>
<p>我的長兒，今年剛才六足歲，他小腦筋中，也裝滿了民族思想，節儉觀念，他自己穿着土布童裝，不買零食。他時看見來親友，不穿土布中裝，而穿國貨毛織品西裝，他照禮招呼之後，終要間，這種料子，是不是外國貨，爲什麽不要用土布來做？今年元旦，有一個至親來，要領他去看電影，他回答東省没有收復，我不願去看，這個至親大受感動，電影自然連帶着不去看，即他喜歡的麻雀牌，也竟至今没有接觸。</p>
<p>根據我們的體騐，深信一件好事，只要我自己先切實做起來，没有不可以擴大的，我們誰不希望每年漏巵的減少，農村經濟的改善，和自己支出的節省，那麽你就服用土布，作一個開端：譬如我們上海市三百萬人，每人每年購買土布一元，已經足使上海近郊農民，得到不少實惠，上海一提倡，各地自必隨之而盛行，在海關的統計報告上自可减少金錢流出的數目，而自己呢，因土布的價廉耐穿，也可相當的省錢。</p>
<p>來！尤其是社會上有地位的同志，有好譽的團體，大家造成一個節儉的風氣，大家造成一個服用土布的習慣，你是愛國的，應該從你自己做起！</p>
<p>最後，貢獻兩條意見，作爲本文的結束：</p>
<p>第一，用土產的棉花，由農家婦女於農暇時，紡成土紗織成的布，方才可以呌做土布，而且有意義，有價値，農家所得的利益較厚，於提倡農村副業的本旨較符。如果用廠紗織的布，至多只能稱國布，不能稱土布，只賺一些工資，恐怕不足以生活的。有的上奸商的當，誤購廉價的日本廠紗，（鄉間極多）織成冒名的土布，那尤其去題萬里了，這是要請提倡機關特别注意的。</p>
<p>第二，紗支的匀凈，染色的經洗，門面的放寬，都應該請提倡或推行的機關，加以切實的研究，予以詳明的指導，能有合作社的組織，尤爲上策。若是無計劃的，提倡推銷，是萬萬不能永久的，即使勉强維持下去，農家所得的實惠，也很有限的。</p>

<h3>九一八九廠國貨商塲之史</h3>
<p>— 仰</p>
<p>九廠臨時商塲，不可以尋常事視之，其功績之大，造就之偉，不可以不記。</p>
<p>吾去年從莫干山中，得到老友方君液仙任君士剛方君劍閣的信，他們說中國化學工業社·美亞織綢廠·三友實業社·五和織造廠·中華珐瑯廠·中華第一針織廠·華社製帽廠·勝德織造廠·一心牙刷廠·租定南京路綺華公司原址·</p>
<p>，設一「九一八」國貨商塲，一方紀念空前國恥，一方表示提倡國貨，我非常高興，以爲國貨界領袖，能如此熱心，一定博得上海市民的贊同。開幕以後，居然顧客雲集，開以前門市營業之新紀念。吾下山以後，在杭州遇到任方二君曁常君必誠，都說九廠商場開幕四五天，處處是人山人海，應接不暇，大家幾没有工夫吃飯，他們做經理的，也親自參加，和他們的職員共同工作。開始時如此，五六天後如此，十幾天後也是如此。可見愛國之心，人人都有。南京路上，决不讓人家來販賣洋貨的。他們因有創設國貨公司的宏願，聘經理，租房屋，聯合工廠，幾個經理忙得不亦樂乎。我也竭力的慫恿他們，務必由理論而成爲事實。不多幾時，鄔君志豪等便在這九廠商場原址，先辦一個上海國貨公司，於是大家仍照原議，確定大陸商場，籌備一個中國國貨公司，在國貨年中南京路上，產生這兩個國貨公司與三公司遙遙相對，這彷彿是一個小小的母親，產生了兩個寗馨兒，那得不快活，那得不慶賀？可以下圖表示：</p>
<p>「九一八」九廠臨時國貨商場－上海國貨公司－中國國貨公司</p>
<p>這兩公司譽九一八商場，雖無直接關係，雖非嫡系，但因這九一八商場而發生這兩大國貨公司，却是一致公認的</p>
<p>時光眞快，一年一度的「九一八」紀念日，又將到了，這九廠的經理，眞是熱心，都說去年的國貨商場，大堪回憶，頗有賡績舉行的必要，並且都說地點一層，應該年年變換，去年在中區，今年可在西區，明年後年再後年可在北區東區南區次第舉行。大家都說很價値。同時得到社會局的帮助，借定靜安寺聖喬其舞場舉行。本年再請了九廠參加。如鴻新之布，廣東兄弟之膠鞋，華昌之鋼精，章華之呢絨，亞光之電木電玉，大華之綱鐵器具，上海燈泡之電泡，裕泰之熱水瓶，中國國貨公司之一切衣食用品，於每日上午九時十八分開店，下午九時十八分停止，中國國貨公司選出了九百十八種精美的出品，在場發賣，應有盡有尤爲特色，由九家而擴大爲十八家，由九而十八，明年今日，或由十八而三十六，七十二，非同業之合作，已有如許成績，造就之偉，功績之大，可想而知。入其場中，東是九一八，西是九一八，人人念九一八，想九一八，悼九一八，不忘九一八，務使此九一八之奇恥大辱，早早湔雪，遼河之畔，長白之巔，到處有我十八家工廠之成績，到此銷我十八家之出品，則此場之設，更有重大之貢獻矣。</p>
<h3>開篇靜安寺與國貨商塲</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>靜安寺一帶，大家公認爲上海的住宅區，南逹海格路，北貫極司非爾路，西通愚園路，綠樹陰濃，璧車載道，美輪美奐之巨室，觸目皆是，出入其間者，都爲夫人小姐，此輩夫人小姐，大都受過中等以上之敎育，中西女塾，聖瑪利亞·滬江大學，都爲此輩夫人小姐之出身地方。以言愛國，此輩夫人小姐，當然較之江北棚破草屋中鳩形鵠面之黃臉婆高出百倍，以言購買力，此輩夫人小姐，當然較之家徒四壁饔飱不繼之窮措大高出千倍。其一家衣食住行上之消費，當然操諸夫人小姐之手。先生公子，一惟夫人小姐之馬首是瞻。故有人曾發狂語，謂靜安寺地方，可辦一大國貨公司，以便此輩夫人小姐之光顧。又有人謂四月初八之浴彿節，靜安寺之百貨大市集，肩摩轂擊，鬢影衣香，可惜不是純粹國貨，不然却是一個推銷國產之好機會。</p>
<p>由大國貨公司，而聯想到各廠之國貨商場。</p>
<p>由四月初八日，（浴佛節）而聯想到九月十八日。（日佔遼東國恥日）</p>
<p>於是而九廠臨時國貨商場？於九一八紀念日開幕矣。開幕之日，悽風苦雨中，顧客雲集，不减其愛用國貨之熱忱。女子是購買力的中心墓礎，這是大家公認的。可是就個人的觀察，及各方的報告，九廠臨時商場的顧客，男子居多，女子反少；知識階級的人居多，資產階級的人反少。靜安寺畔的購買國貨空氣，遠不及南京路上的三公司和國貨公司的踴躍。難道此輩夫人小姐，不喜歡愛國麽？不樂用國貨麽？我知决不如是。一言以括之，尙無信仰心，還是我們宣傳上之不力。我於此敢正告此飽受敎育富有愛國思想的夫人小姐。</p>
<p>（一）此臨時商場之設，完全爲紀念「九一八」之國恥，在此國貨年中，希望人人留一深刻之紀念，從今以後，誓以服用國貨爲報國救國之道。</p>
<p>（二）此商場之貨，可稱純粹國貨，旣無改頭換面之品，亦無冒牌隱戤之物，夫人小姐，儘可放心，儘可購用。</p>
<p>（三）此商場之貨，各工廠爲引起夫人小姐購買之興趣與信心起見，價極便宜，尤爲合算。</p>
<p>（四）此商場之設，完全供給滬西住宅區市民購買之便利，希望愚園道上極司非爾路與海格路之途中，香車璧乘，鶯語花影間，目所觸，耳所聞，口中所稱道者，都是國貨。吾知夫人小姐，夕陽歸去時，都說「國貨到底不錯」「國貨何遜外貨」之聲，一片珠璣咳吐也。</p>
<p>（五）此商場之設，最便利者，近則墨梯與聖瑪利亞，遠則約翰·光華·大夏諸大學，人謂最不愛國最樂用外貨之諸大學，趁此機會，諸君子可以一顯顏色，湔雪此言。</p>
<p>可愛之靜安寺，可羡之靜安寺一帶之住宅區，更可愛之九廠臨時商場。諸君昔嘗出入於聖喬其之場者，今日更不可不到此莊嚴璀璨之九廠國貨商場，更毋忘此一年一度爲「九一八」紀念而設之九廠國貨商場。</p>
<h3>靜安寺畔的國貨臨時商塲</h3>
<p>— 徐履謙</p>
<p>渴望着的九廠國貨二届臨時商塲，終於在九一八紀念日的上午九時十八分很莊嚴隆重的儀式下舉行開幕典禮了！該場位於滬西靜安寺電車站聖喬其跳舞塲原址，我還記得，去年各工廠紀念九一八第一届週年舉辦時，是假南京路綺華公司，歷時三四星期的長久，今年擴充範圍，除著名基本工廠九家外，尙邀請參加者九家，共十八家，規模更宏大，跳舞塲的門首架搭松柏電燈五彩牌樓，夜間放光，耀眩奪目，踏進門去一看，耳目爲之煥然一新，誠然，無疑地，國貨到了現在已有了相當的地位，你看，雖然穿着高跟鞋的摩登「蜜絲」們，向來是完全替洋貨做推銷員的，而今對於國貨也有相當的了解與認識了！不信，你看：她們不是很熱烈地三五成羣挽着手陸續地進出嗎？這，當然是表示國貨前途很好的象徵啊！</p>
<p>的確，年來國貨在質和量的方面都有很驚人的底突飛猛進，所以出品的精美，和舶來品比較起來，實有過之無不及，事實很明顯的昭示我們，所以能彀得到一般人底熱烈愛護歡迎着，眞的，我相信，國貨如能積極永久似雨後春筍般的爆發努力着，不數年，國貨充斥市塲，洋貨自然能夠在無形中消滅絶跡了！即使就是繁華都市甲中國底上海的話。</p>
<p>我希望我最敬愛的女士們，以及關心國貨的同志們，你們在閑空的當兒，應當必須光臨去參觀一下，該塲裏面有各工廠一九三三年最新驚人的出品陳列着，美不勝收，住居滬西的人們，近在咫尺，格外來得便當，規定日期自九一八起至雙十節止，每日營業時間上午九時十八分起至下午九時十八分止，以資紀念眞眞的意義。</p>
<h3>花紗布前奏</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>「鋤禾日當午，汗滴禾下土，誰知盤中餐，粒粒皆辛苦，」這是古人說的白米飯，是要從榖，糙，而後春成白米，再煮飯吃，一滴汗一粒米，何等不容易！</p>
<p>衣服穿到吾人身上，是要從花，紗，而後職成布，再裁衣穿，一滴汗一縷紗，</p>
<p>也是何等不容易！</p>
<p>我可以說：「誰知身上衣，縷縷皆辛苦」了，自從洋布納寵，土布遺棄，農村經濟奔潰，國脈氣息僅屬，這好像姨太擅權，大夫人吃癟，門衰家落，是指顧問事！所以保持國脈，要人人穿自種棉，自紡紗，自織布的土布，應該人人想到「誰知身上衣，縷縷皆辛苦」寗可做有財，有壽，穿土布的土老兒，不可做愁人朝餐無夜米，身上還穿摩登衣，死要面子活受罪了！</p>
<h3>煊閙之國貨市場</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>本市四届國展籌備已久，哄動一時的「本市第四届國貨展覽會」，自於本月十五日下午二時在小西門蓬萊市塲，由吳市長（代表）升旗，胡蝶女士揭幕以來，社會人士，羣相注目，聯袂接踵，紛至沓來，連日車馬如雲，參觀者絡繹不絶，而提倡國貨之呼聲，亦得高入雲霄，按此次參加國貨工廠，凡一百七十六家，精英薈萃，國貨之光，萬物雜陳，無美不備，而裝置設備，金碧輝煌，入夜電炬齊明，光耀奪目，熱閙情景，實爲從來所未有，爲國貨年生色不少。</p>
<p>九廠國貨商塲慘痛－「九一八」兩週紀念之來臨，這一個有意義有價値的紀念商塲，也就跟着在靜安寺畔，巍然成立，「以奮鬥精神，而紀念國恥，」所謂提倡實業，國貨救國，用意深長，良用欽佩，蓋此臨時商塲即係由｜中國化學工業社，三友實業社，中華琺瑯廠，五和織造廠，美亞織綢廠，華福製廠，中華第一針織廠，一心牙刷廠，勝德織造廠，等九家滬上著名國貨工廠，聯合組織，於去年今日之一届商塲時，已有相當之成績，此次二届舉行，並又聯合廣東兄弟樹膠公避司，章華毛絨紡織公司，裕泰熱水瓶廠，華昌鋼清廠，中國國貨公司鴻新染織廠，亞光製造公司，大華鐵廠等八家，規模益廣，犧牲益大，努力進行，我儕民衆，當熱烈助成之。</p>
<h3>隨感國貨運動感言</h3>
<p>— 攻心</p>
<p>九一八第二周年</p>
<p>時間過的眞快，轉瞬間舉國痛心的九一八，又第二次來到我們的眼前了！牠代表我們整個民族的最大恥辱，代表我們的國仇，在這一天，全中華民國人民，無論男女老幼，個個切齒痛恨，熱血沸騰，四萬萬個心，一致是「復仇」「雪恥」的心！</p>
<p>但是怎樣復仇，怎樣雪恥呢？</p>
<p>事實告訴我們：全中國人是患着一種可怕的長期貧血症。六十年來，鮮紅的血，不斷的向外流，流成了小渠，流成了江河，流成了海洋，使我們變成弱者，病夫，終於不可抵抗外邪的侵襲！而造成九一八這一類的痛史！</p>
<p>數年來農村經濟破產，工商業的不景氣，貧血的徵候，一天天深刻的表露出來！結果，全民族的没落和滅亡，是不可逃的必然的公例！</p>
<p>今日唯一的救亡政策，是「止血」和「補血」。止血的方法是不用外貨，補血的方法是提倡國貨。今年經國民政府定爲「國貨年」，社會上提倡國貨的聲浪，也很高。上海方面國貨廠家，確在這一年中，經過不少的努力，有許多出品在質和量的方面，都能勝過舶來品，而定價則異常低廉。這確是一種好現象。</p>
<p>社會是有連瑣性的。提倡國貨固然需要工商界的努力，但是政府的獎勵和社會的風氣，也是兩個最重大的要素。最近日本政府訓令上海居留民，一律購用日貨，便是一個値得注意的例子。至於社會風氣之養成，則尤　一般領袖人物，學校敎師，和家庭父兄，一致提倡，以身作則。</p>
<p>風雨飄搖國難重重的中國，處在國際經濟戰劇烈的今日，若不聯合努力在生產方面奮鬥，實在無生存的理由。以四萬萬人購買力的國家，如果從今天起，厲行「止血」和「補血」的運動，將無量數的金錢集中於國貨市塲，這樣，都市自然可以繁榮，農民的鮮血不向外流，農村自然也可以繁榮起來。同時再合政府與人民的力量，從事於開發利源和實際建設事業。則民族復興的希望，不是不能實現的。</p>
<p>雪恥！復仇！復興中華民族！一定要從國民經濟上着眼！只要我們全體同佨，人人下最後之决心，作經濟上戰士，從事於十年生聚，在這十年中，絶對不購外貨，｜尤其是某國貨｜則某國最近以二百萬元在虹口所築的神秘的兵營，其價値適等於零了！努力吧！同胞們！不要忘了「九一八」！不要忘了國貨！</p>
<h3>罐頭食品和農村經濟</h3>
<p>— 意虹</p>
<p>交通便利了，帝國主義的貨物也跟着用傾銷的政策，向內地農村積極攻擊，牠的結果是生產衰落，經濟崩潰。但是內地的農民能不能享着交通便利的好處呢？没有｜持久的農產像米，麥，棉，豆等等，爲了沿途捐稅重重，運輸不便，不能到城市裏來和外貨競爭，雖然現在鐵路農產的運費，减去了不少。不持久的農產像蔬菜，瓜果，魚蝦等等，又是因爲不容易保存相當的時間，以致也遭着同樣的命運。啊！「榖賤傷農」又來一個「副業不振」，農村呌牠怎樣不破產呢？所以現在間接救濟農村，直接救濟副業的罐頭食品製造是刻不容緩了；因爲牠能夠吸收農村過剩的產物，使得地盡其利，物盡其用。</p>
<p>罐頭食品一業，是現代科學的產兒，牠可以保存食物新鮮程度，使牠能夠流播廣遠，以供同好。現在我們很平常地吃到英國的牛奶，美國的果汁，德國的牛肉汁，法國的葡萄酒和其他種種罐頭食品。這些「來路貨」所以能夠暢銷市塲，實在由於迎合國人的嗜好和國貨罐頭食品製造缺乏的緣故；即使有的，出品也不很完美，所以很難適合社會的需要。</p>
<h3>國貨</h3>
<p>— 黃模廉</p>
<p>國貨年中國貨塲，精良國貨競稱揚；大家愛國大家要，外貨從今運不昌！</p>
<p>國貨年中國貨塲，便宜國貨競稱揚；大家愛國大家買，外貨從今氣不祥！</p>
<p>國貨年中國貨揚，時新國貨競稱揚；大家愛國大家用，外貨從今命不長！</p>
<p>「精良」，「便宜」，「時新」，是選買貨物時三個要件。今觀九廠國貨臨時商塲等處的貨物，於此三者，確乎具備，我人買了，十分滿意；况更償了愛國的志願，又何樂不爲呢！</p>

<h3>麥市期跌現漲</h3>
<p>昨日麥市面、大致呈平落之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌六七角、坎拿大跌八角不等、故開價後、市氣已見平定、兼以華北狀態、愈益不佳未來粉銷、當受打擊、故麥市希望、亦然更少、下午又因粉市回落、人心愈形散淡、至澳麥傳聞、如果屬實、恐遠期衝動、又難免也、結果十十一月份各小三分、十二月份小二分、一月份小四分、</p>
<p>現麥存底漸少、新到不多、且因產價高昂、販運不划、貨主心思甚堅、對於中關以上之貨繼續喊高、昨日各漲三五分、開出瑤灣麥四元姜堰高郵麥三元八角一分、寶應三元八角、揚州三元七角半、無錫三元七角、六合三元六角九分、德橋三元六角六分、共計五千包、由福新信大辦去、</p>
<h3>生油步跌五六角</h3>

<h3>芝蔴跌風重見</h3>
<p>－新花生仁續開原盤－</p>
<p>芝蔴市塲交易雖熱閙、但祗數十包零碎辦胃、故在此貨湧之候、非貶價不能兜售、所以昨市又有三四角之下跌、統市成交新陳蔴四百零三包、而貨品確有六處之多、新花生及生仁第二批已有續到、惟爲數寥寥、僅烟台花生十包、青島生仁二十二包、致不敷問胃、故其售價尙守原盤云、</p>
<h3>絲茶洋莊絲銷益陷絶境</h3>
<p>（金壇秋繭繅折較小）金壇模範區區、今届秋蠶成績較優、繭產亦較宜溧爲豐、繭身優厚、繅折較小、宜興溧陽等秋乾繭平均須七百斤繅絲一百斤、金壇祇五百五十斤、惜繭價不廉、絲本每包須靜扯六百元强、</p>
<p>（華絲運美幾成弩末）美郵格蘭脫總統號昨日出口、本埠藍樂璧等祇有華絲八十件裝往西雅圖、</p>
<p>（人造絲客銷仍寥落）內地人造絲需要不起、客銷依然寥落、昨祗本埠各綢廠進紅藍金鐘五星牌等現期貨十八箱、價自一百八十元七角半至一百六十五角淨盤、</p>
<p>（華絲美銷難望轉機）美國絲織廠工潮一時尙難告平、紐約存絲充厚、需要不起、華絲美銷實乏轉機之望、英法等處日絲競銷仍力、廠經來價奇小、華絲商虧本太巨碍難抛售、昨祗連納與綢門進白廠經二十五包、價均低廉、仍係補空性質云、</p>
<h3>茶市略形清淡</h3>
<p>昨各歐莊均以市上屯溪歙縣遂安等路珍眉、寥寥無幾、而婺源北路珍眉、非洲去路呆滯、是以均持觀望態度、全市僅白頭莊富林瑞昌等行、對於婺源東路珍眉貢熙綠茶、略有進胃、至英國行家、雖亦有少數收辦、但綠茶交易、已較前大爲减色云</p>
<h3>糖市二四粗砂白軋缺</h3>
<p>昨糖市以關金又升、兼之二四粗砂白存底告缺、故公會劃盤出户呌漲二角、爲二十二元、但進户仍還二十一元八角、致乏成交、二十號中砂白二十一元二角、八九號陳荷赤十六元五角半、太古糖Ｂ嘜升五分、爲二十一元七角半、中華國華振記綿白均開原價、潮青昨開二百數十包、高提莊價爲十六元一角半、次之十六元、黃崗青十五元七角、至五六角、</p>

<h3>油市柏油銷寂一再價跌</h3>
<p>短時期間絶無來蘇之望</p>
<p>柏油至秋令銷塲本甚活潑、蓋燭淘已以夏令過後、均將開作、乃今庚因夏銷極清、各燭號所預製成之夏貨、不能銷罄、咸有存積、故開作遲而又遲、且製造亦减、致柏油之用塲更見寥落、以往年而衡、每届中元過後、必有一批銷路、今秋竟與夏季落令時相若、而本埠各行所備之油、均爲供秋淘用途、孰意銷清如洗、不及往年之半、以致市面一蹶不振、惟查江浙兩省所存、尙不過厚、而漢口入秋所到貨、與夏令所存、不下三萬數千担、乃去路毫無、人心不免恐慌、價價一跌再跌、據昨函所詳、重荆祇每担二十二元左右、平荆二十一元光景、麻城油十九元之間、然秋後毎皂用已罷、全靠燭淘去路、無如燭銷之清、較往年更甚、各處皆同、而漢市所存、亦較往年雄厚、恐一時無轉醒之望、本埠存數、雖祗二三千件、但中秋節届、形勢之呆滯、實所罕見、而售價亦已跌而又跌矣、計重荆每砠售二十六元、平荆二十五元、麻城二十三元、</p>
<h3>疋頭雨衣布市價難振</h3>
<p>因存貨不能久擱之關係</p>
<p>連日秋雨迷濛、雨衣布交易日增、本街與漢帮需要更殷、單面開水美較其他銷塲更旺、昨四○二六老牌貨價開五元一角凈盤、頭號貨五元零五分、（拆疋蓋回單）二號貨四元七角半、三號四元一角、雙面紗三元六角、毛面象皮裏三元五角、紗面象皮裏二元、查其售價不能上漲者、因有象皮膠水混合製成、存貨難以藏擱、銷路雖有、同業紛紛削價賤售也、</p>
<h3>五金英白鐵陡起跌風</h3>
<p>英白鐵近因各帮採辦寥少、而復受東貨湧到之影響、市氣頓見鬆動、標準陡起跌風、雖同業爲血本攸關、竭力設法維持、但因推銷乏術、終覺回挺無能、現市七尺紅鳥牌每張估一元四角、雜牌一元三角七分、六尺一元二角、二十八號每擔十七元四角、二十六號十六元四角、二十四號十五元三角半、比之先前莫不小去二三分至二三角不等、况廢歷中秋在卽、故交易一層、定無回好之望、</p>
<h3>新鐵貨大批來申</h3>
<p>昨據洋行消息、稱紐約上月裝出來申之洋元角鐵路皮鋼條等新鐵貨共有四萬餘擔之鉅、聞因美匯之放長、本埠同業尙有繼續訂交、</p>

<h3>提倡體育與劇烈運動</h3>
<p>— 朱</p>
<p>據說現在學校裡面，認眞提倡體育，强逼學生在正課以外，另外習練一種劇烈運動；像鐵槓，跳高，長距離賽跑等等。假使這種劇烈運動，不能及格，體育就不能及格，那麽憑你德育，智育，都好到極點，依然不能升級，不能畢業。</p>
<p>一有健全的身子。才能建健全的事業。這確乎是至理名言。文縐縐的兩腿書櫉，誠然不適用於這國難嚴重的中國；不過强逼學生劇烈運動，究竟是否合乎提倡體育的羅輯，却不能不使我發生懷疑。</p>
<p>事實是最雄辯。這次蘇州運動會預賽的當兒，某校的學生，在跑一萬米賽跑的當兒，没有跑到終點，早已暈到在草地上，人事不知；假使不是醫院在附近的話，眞不知結果怎樣。某家的兒子，這次在上海的運動會裏，就犧牲於跳高之下；等到父母得信，早已一棺附身，萬事皆了。還有一個學生，因盤鐵槓，將胃囊掙破，等到抬進醫院，早已回生無術。此外學生因劇烈運動，受傷咯血的，更指不勝屈。可是學校章程的限止，學生要升班和畢業，病好之後，祇好依舊拚生捨命的去幹着那劇烈運動。</p>
<p>我記得孔子的敎育弟子是因材設敎的，大學的課程，也是分門别類的；科學尙且要「因人施敎，」這種關係學生生命的劇烈運動，豈可也像玩把戲般强逼學生蠻幹！雖然運動原係救濟孱弱的，越是孱弱的人，越非努力運動不可；論理雖然充分，不過事實究竟是事實。我敬掬着十二分誠意，請求一般提倡敎育的敎育家，和學校當局，不要單爲運動優勝，是足以光輝學校着想，也求你們顧一顧學生們的生命，不要爲運動犧牲才好。</p>
<h3>呎</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>英尺簡寫作呎，英寸簡寫作吋，起初以爲不過和中國的尺寸略示分别而已，後來看東華錄，凡是英吉利，法蘭西，都加上「口」的偏傍，便給我研究出當時的用意了。什麽用意呢？因爲「口」字，就是圍字，古文國字，把口作偏旁，意思是說他們都是域外，不屬中國的。</p>
<p>這種自大的觀念，我們在官書上，隨處可以看到，不煩舉例。但曾幾何時，非但把口的偏旁取消，還要加上一個大字的尊號，這個，我們在上海也隨處可以聽到，尤其是對於英吉利，像大英地界，大英照會，大英皮等，有時號稱士大夫者，也不免要說出口來，這也可算得物極必反了。</p>
<p>上海的法租界，論理也有上尊號的權利，爲什麽只稱法蘭西地界呢？這一點，我也想過，大約爲了英吉利人比較的資格最老，那些買辦階級，僕歐階級，先和英吉利人往來，有了主賓關係，便生愛戴之心，感激涕零零之餘，就上一個尊號給他罷。</p>
<p>美利堅在東華錄上也加過口的偏旁，日本就没有，大約也爲了同種同文共存共榮的關係？現在還有遺蹟可尋的，只有『囒嗬』水了。</p>
<p>字書關於呎，吋，哩，噸，咖啡，嗎啡，都收在口字部。我以爲應當列入口字部。倘然說口字部的字没有把口作偏旁的，那麽列入口字部，更没有意義，倘然說爲了譯音，那麽呎，吋，哩，分别是會意，不是形聲啊。</p>
<p>這個見解，我不敢自信，還得請博雅君子賜敎！</p>
<h3>正始中學拾雋</h3>
<p>— 石征鴻</p>
<p>我常常聽人說，現在的學風眞壞極了，武斷的說一句，簡直是現代無好學生。我以爲不是現代無好學生，實是没有好學校，不是没有好學校，實是没有眞心辦學的好人才。正始的創辦人杜月笙先生，校長陳羣先生，他們眞是實心辦學的人。杜先生的宣言道：「鄙人幼年失學，至今服務社會，深感讀書之必要······」。他辦學的出發點，自然和其他辦學者不同。所以正始開辦還祇兩年，已斥私資八萬餘金，這確是値得驚異的事。講到人才方面，如敎務長余祥森，訓育主任陳霽湖兩君，都是積二三十年敎育經騐的人，所聘敎員，大都一時之選。因此正始旣有眞心辦學的人才，就成爲好的學校，就敎成了許多好的學生，我因爲正始當局，主張實事求是，不重宣傳，因此只記較有興趣的事，至於整個的敎學實施，和成績表現，將留待關心敎育事業的人直接去觀察吧。</p>
<p>（一）食不語偌大的膳堂裏，坐滿三百左右的人，只是運箸如風，埋頭吃飯，絶對没有談話的聲音，他們眞能做到孔老先生「食不語」的信條，同時在這些地方，就看出他們的紀律是怎樣。</p>
<p>（二）門外客關於圖書館曾有過一件有趣的故事，在去年秋天的某日，有一過路的人行經校外，他聽到了讀書的聲音，就立定了脚，只是在校門外徘徊不去，適爲訓育主任陳君瞥見，遽延之入，徧觀全校，嘖嘖稱善，對陳君說：「貴校的學生，確能眞心讀書。」去後，即託蘇州陸翥雙先生向杜董事長致意，願年助五百金，爲圖書館添置圖書之費，始悉客名高賡生，蘇人，留日華僑。</p>
<p>（三）吾頂秃矣正始學生，工作極忙，固不暇修飾，就是在頭髮上，司丹康，生髮水，也絶對無緣，但長髮　　，亦殊未是，陳校長因此特下薙髮令，限一星期竣事，但不出三日，全校師生，都已牛山濯濯了。有某生在他每日校中規定的日記裏，記下下面幾句話：「秋陽抗皜皜，人影在地，吾頂秃矣。」詞殊傐雋永　　（四）特别標記這次我去參觀，在運動塲上，正比賽足球，遂作壁上觀，訓育主任陳君指示我道：「那邊是我們的人馬，這邊是某校的隊伍，」我笑答着道：「我瞧到了和尙頭的，就知道是貴校的學生了。」相與大笑。這確是正始學生的特别標記。</p>
<h3>蘆花小艇</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>水面上瑟瑟地搖動了一陣白色的風，小小的晴蜓，舒服得振起薄翼，從蒹葭的絨障裏青天飛。那岸上的蘆桿，被動地顫抖，淺渚的萍叢間，就蓋上了幾朶蓬鬆的落花。有幾朶正在空間傾跌下來的時機，突被燕子橫江飛來，巧妙地銜了開去，時候又那麽靜寂；感到了一種不可言說的輕快，這好像是深山中聽到柳蔭裏黃鶯啼的境界。</p>
<p>和曼麗相對的默默地看，各人的微笑，堆着滿臉，但我們的心，這樣平靜，我們是被沈醉在一個秋天的啞默音樂裏</p>
<p>一匹艇子打從西溪來，滿堤是蕭蕭的秋聲，也滿眼是白白的寒色，祇因爲太陽很好，水又那麽澄清，天又那麽高爽，秋這感覺，並没有一絲機會得襲進我們的心胸。我和曼麗各穿着黑色的衣裳，點綴在這麽一個銀色的簾幃裏，我們靜得精緻。世界上如眞有極樂的佛土，怕就在這裏。</p>
<p>「假如我是個鴟夷子皮，你就得是西施了啊！」我伺近伊的肩，輕聲地說：</p>
<p>雖然這譬喩未免唐突。</p>
<p>「這不是廣淼的五湖，是一叢蘆邊葦的淺水，你應該是個被夫差大王趕走的伍子胥！」伊說着笑了。</p>
<p>「哦，這樣也好，把生命之舟，聽天風吹吧。窮到面有菜色的時候，會遇着漁父呢。」</p>
<p>「蘆中人！蘆中人！」伊撫着我的髮這樣呌。</p>
<p>「㗒，我的知己！你待我實在太好了」</p>
<p>繼着，我們的手互相緊握了起來。船夫在艇首煎茶，一點聲都没有，只蘆花靜靜地一片一片飛下。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十六回酸楚襟懷當前還祝福倥偬戎馬暗裏突移軍</p>
<p>偶然一抬頭，就看到那家乳茶舖屋簷下，懸了一條布市招，在空中飄蕩，門口放了木架子，上面架着一把大銅水壺。只看那壺嘴子裏，熱氣陣陣的向外噴着，便聯想到熱水冲藕粉的那種情形，就用脚在車板上連連踏了兩下道：停下來，我進去吃點東西。張三雖然將車子停下來了，可是他心裏也就想着，難道二爺肚子裏有銷食日蟲，剛才他由飯館子裏出來的，怎麽這會子又要進去吃點心？可是乳茶舖裏的店伙，已經笑着向積之表示歡迎了。他道喝！二爺多時不見，在那兒發財？積之點着頭，走到一個散座邊坐了下來。店伙道：二爺怎麽不到雅座裏去？雅座裏現在空着。積之笑道：你還記得我以前老上雅座。店伙也微笑着點了一點頭。積之道：你給我煑一杯熱熱的咖啡來喝，我吃了油膩的東西，肚子裏應當冲刷一下。店伙道：你在那兒喝酒來着，我知道。積之道：這可怪了，我在那裏吃酒，你會知道，你且說出來聽聽，看你說的對不對。店伙道：聽說楊家老姑娘，就在這幾天放大定，也許你是來賀喜的，你和他······他家老太太不壞。這店伙把話剛說出口，就覺得這話有些冐昧，因之連抬着兩下肩膀就笑了一笑。積之雖覺得他的話近於冒昧，然而這是事實，有什麽法子可以否認，也就只好微微一笑，對付着過去就算了。店伙自到廚房裏去取咖啡，把這話扯開了。積之一人坐在散座上想着，不料趙連長眞娶了桂枝，把我蒙在鼓裏了。這樣看起來，女子没有一個不慕虛榮的。（一九九）</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>美德人吸鴉片的數</h3>
<p>最近從美國回到德國的藥學技師巴烏爾華爾甫博士；他在德國醫學恊會，報告視察所得的情形。他說：美國與德國吸鴉片的人，美國有十萬以上十五萬以下，德國在四千以上至六千以下。就是美德兩國平均起來，美國的吸鴉片者，大約有德國有的二十五倍。至於中國，差不多有八百萬人，所以中國的弱，足以在這數字中表現出來的。</p>
<h3>三千年前骸骨</h3>
<p>意大利的彼羅奇亞市附近支愛特那山中的洞窟裏，最近發見了很多的骸骨。這等骸骨中，以男女小孩。爲最多，大約有七十多具。現經意大利人類學家耐來普極阿尼敎授調查結果，都是三千年前的，就是羅馬人移住到意大利以前，居住于這半島的人種骸骨，那洞窟就是他們住居的地方。</p>
<h3>數字的人種學</h3>
<p>現在全世界的總人口，約有二十億人。其中基督敎徒有七億，佔全世界第一，而基督敎徒中，舊敎徒爲三億三千萬，新敎徒爲二億三千萬，正敎徒一億四千五百萬，猶太敎徒一千七百萬。其次爲佛敎徒，有五億七千萬，印度敎徒有二億四千萬，回回敎徒有二億二千萬。他如異敎徒有二億七千萬，異敎徒多生存于阿非利加；南美；奧地利亞等荒野地方以及中國雲貴黔青等處。若從言語上數字的分類；說中國語者有四億三千萬，說英語者有二億二千萬，說俄語者有一億七千萬，說德語者有一億，說法語者有七千五百萬，說西班牙語者有六千五百萬，說意大利語者爲四千萬，說日本語者有六千萬，說馬來語者有三千五百萬，說波爾特加爾語者有三千萬，說斯干狄那系語者有一千三百萬，說荷蘭語者有一千二百萬，說希臘語者有八百萬，說阿剌伯語者有六百萬，說興篤司太尼語者有二億七千五百萬。這等言說的勢力，以中國語爲最强大，且最爲複雜。又從人種的分類；全世界大别爲黃白黑三種，（紅　兩色已淘汰）白種人有九億五千萬黃種有五億五千萬，其餘都爲黑種。</p>
<h3>世界產金地域</h3>
<p>南阿聯邦的德蘭司維亞地方，其產金的數量，佔全世界總產額五成以上。本年度八月產金之數，超過從前的紀錄，就是一個月出產純金爲九十九萬一千盎司，而這等金原爲太古時代的砂金，與砂礫混合，固着在地層中，東西綿互約有百三十哩，南北約有四十哩。</p>
<h3>英國民間航空</h3>
<p>去年度英國民間航空界的意外事故，總計十五件。可是這等事故的大部分，都是因爲操縱者是門外漢的緣故，但是旅客飛機從來没有發生事故，傷害人命。去年度的飛行距離總計，逹百二十七萬六千九百哩，飛行郵件爲二百二十五萬封。現在英國有三十二所飛行俱樂部，會員九千名，其中得航空特許證者千五百七十三名。</p>
<h3>德人生活狀態</h3>
<p>— 楚玉</p>
<p>據柏林內閣統計局發表；三年前德國的總人口，爲六千五百三十萬人。調查其生活狀態，每人一年間的消費品數量：啤酒十七加侖，葡萄酒二加侖，强烈酒類半加侖，紙烟四百零八支，雪茄七十二支，用於吃烟的自來火，千九百根，食料品方面：麵包百五十四磅，肉類一百零七磅，馬鈴薯七百七十磅，水果三十三磅，奶油二十二磅。在這數字中的喫烟飲酒二項，近年類已逐漸减少，這因一半國民對于衛生思想的向上，一半因爲國民經濟的困難。</p>

<h3>打雜者造成的文化</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>大約兩千年前，拉丁諷刺詩人茹維奈爾（Juvenal）嘗有句云：「爲求生存的努力，失却生命的意義。」</p>
<p>悲哉言乎！</p>
<p>參加無論何種事業的人們，他的努力。若不得不完全以生存爲第一義，則不但生命的意義因而失却，即其事業，亦將因而大受損害，貶其價値。在從事著作的人們中，這樣的事實，如今是更其悲劇的地存在着。</p>
<p>倘有人，將在各種出版物上執筆的著者譯者，加以調查統計，（假如這是可能，）則必可看到，在百分比中占着絶對的多數的一夥，是完全爲着稿費而著譯的。又因志在稿費，所以他們所著譯的稿件，門類性質，常極龐雜。每以一人之筆，寫了小說詩歌，又譯國際政治經濟的論文，撰了社會主義的論評，又作獨裁政治的介紹，他如一切科學故事，文化問題······凡出版物而有稿費者，這類的作家，都能供給合乎需要的稿件。這類稿件的出路，大抵是本國「雜誌」，而來源則是外國「雜誌」。因此，這類作家是「打雜者」，和紹興的「墮民」一樣，東家做喜事，西家做喜事，他們都去帮，只要有「紙包錢」就行。</p>
<p>這樣的作家手下出來的作品，譯文，佔着現代中國的「文化成績」的很大的一部分。</p>
<p>不過，這樣的作家，究竟不同於「墮民」，「墮民」的打雜，是一種傳統的正式的職業，除此以外，他們本無成就何種專業的希望。而在文化界打雜的青年們，則當其跨入文化界之初，大抵是懷着一種遠大的憧憬，選定了一種適合自己的心力的工作，努力使自己有專門的成就的。然而在這樣的社會裏，吃飯已是第一件難事，遑論深造一種學藝的餘裕，於是，這些青年，只能流爲「墮民」，「打雜」爲生了。</p>
<p>於打雜者之外，雖然少數，「專家」是也有的，他們或爲大學敎授，或爲書局編輯，或者有更好的地位，不靠雜誌的稿費生活，總該有專門的研究，爲我們的文化界作中流砥柱了罷？然而，事實並不如此，我們的專家，依然是打雜爲生的，往往也以一人之身，兼爲國際政治專家，中國社會史專家，中國文學史專家，敎育專家，翻譯專家，什麽什麽專家，······正如政治上的紅人的職銜，不遑枚舉。他們所不同於另一種打雜家者··稿子不待「投，」有人會拉，稿費多，名目堂皇，不是「墮民」，而是「專門學者。」如此而已。</p>
<p>中國全部文化，便是這兩種打雜者所造成的「萬有文庫。」</p>
<p>自己也是「墮民」之一，寫畢此文，偶見定　全集中，有這樣一首詩：　　「狂臚文獻耗中年，亦是今生後起緣。猛憶兒時心力異，一燈紅接混茫前。」讀罷更覺感慨無窮。</p>
<h3>奴才新論</h3>
<p>— 林籟</p>
<p>奴才是階級社會的副產物，起初是屬於不上不下的中間層，因爲根基不穩，所以難免游離，游離的結果是給上層吸住，其所以能夠討得這種好處，就在善於利用臉和腿的原故。這個道理咱們中國人懂得頂透徹，例如『奴顏婢膝』就是說奴才慣在臉上腿上用功夫，臉上的功夫要做到兩頰給主子打了還能陪笑呌『老爺！當心你的手，别打痛了！』腿上的功夫要做到能屈能伸，即跑路趕山的時候是硬的直的，回頭見主子的時候是軟的彎的，這是古今中外同出一轍的形式，雖因功夫的深淺而略有出入，如咱們中國人之獨臻上乘，但仍無損於公式之科學性的。</p>
<p>但是奴才究竟如大家所鄙棄的那樣没有出息嗎？奴才眞是蠢才嗎？</p>
<p>奴才自己是有一貫的計劃的，『奴才』不過是逹到目的的手段，換言之，方法而已，策略而已，其中便有『幸福須以最大的痛苦換取』的大道理，何况做得成奴才還要有起碼的天才呢！因此奴才决决是蠢才。</p>
<p>正望上爬的時候，奴才不願洩露自己的秘密是有道理的，就因爲保不住半途不會掉下來的原故。爬上去以後，還是秘而不宣也有道理的，就因爲自己已經是主子了，從此也照樣用得着奴才了。爲什麽雖是公然的秘密而終不願自己揭發呢？這大槪是由於想逃避敵人的視綫或者還有點害怕自己掌嘴，所以鄙棄奴才痛駡奴才的人們之中也就有着奴才，因此奴才並不是蠢才。</p>
<p>主子固然的權利駡一聲『奴才』，然而這樣的好運氣是不會長久的！</p>
<p>至於奴才的敵人是不但不把奴才看成蠢才，並且他們從經騐知道奴才比主子還可怕，因爲奴才最會裝成各種不同的臉譜，要出各種不同的戲法。</p>
<h3>旅途雜筆（續）</h3>
<p>— 天馬</p>
<p>四，故鄉人語</p>
<p>船過南京後，我偶然在船欄邊發現了我底故鄉的鄉音，那是一對中年夫婦在閑談異地風光。因爲自己離開故鄉已近十年；立刻，一種鄉思使我對於鄉音感到特别的興趣，我急於要知道一些故鄉的消息，於是懷着欣喜和驚異的心情，趕忙過去和他們攀談。</p>
<p>在互通姓名以後，我們便開始談到故鄉最近的情况。不消說，世事滄桑，故鄉已經不是我底記憶中的故鄉了，從前的老人們現在已凋零殆盡，而兒時的伴侶，現在則多半已是活躍在故鄉那小小的政治舞臺上的角色。十年小别，頓成隔世，浮生若夢，逝者如斯，聽了那位故鄉人的報告之後，望着滔滔江水，一種無名的惆悵，竟使我半響說不出話來。</p>
<p>最使我驚奇的是故鄉經濟破產之速，和官府榨取繁。據說：故鄉現在每擔榖最高的價格，只値一元二角，其他副產品如茶葉，麥，木材，等更是賤到超出我們的想像以外。不論是豐收與歉收，一般佃農僱農固然是日常處在飢餓與冷凍之下，就是一般中小地主以及富農也是焦頭爛額，快步向破產的路上狂奔。普遍的現象是有田無人種，有貨無人買，好好的田地讓它荒廢，而每一個人都只有疾首蹙額無可奈何地忍受着飢寒的凌遲。</p>
<p>然而官府的壓榨却並不因農村破產而輕减絲毫，田賦附加已超過正費十數倍，卽每兩田賦除了正費之外，還要繳納附加稅四十多元，另外還有團防捐，剿匪捐，甚至所謂良民捐。最近又懲收救國捐五百萬，按縣攤派，限期繳納，稍一遲延，卽捉將官　去，以抗捐論罪。</p>
<p>普通每一個鄉村都編有壯丁隊，須隨時聽命集合，並厲行保甲法，其目的當然是在於防「匪」；至於城鎭，則五家聯保，一家犯罪，四家同科：每每更深夜靜，忽然戒嚴，家家武裝搜查，闔家老幼鵠立，順受點騐，如偶來一客，未及報告，卽捉將官　去。因此一般人民，不僅飢寒交迫，且卽欲一宵安眠亦不可得。</p>
<p>可是匪盜却並不因這樣的周密防範和嚴厲鎭壓而消滅，反之，更是如火如荼的蔓延起來。大股的「土匪」　不必說，綁票勒索的宵小也是隨處皆是。據說故鄉某地有兩個乞兒在一所破廟的　蔭下納凉，閑談到土匪，甲說：「像我們身無長物，總算是不怕他們光顧了」，言下，兩人都怡然自得，拊掌大笑。可是那天晚上，便有幾條好漢走進破廟，將他們縛起來，牽往一家肉店，說有兩隻肥猪要賣給他們，如果不受，便要借他們的屠凳宰殺。結果，那家肉店出了十幾元錢，而這兩位乞兒也已經嚇得面無人色。好漢們臨走時笑問乞兒：「你們怕不怕我們光顧呀」！即此一例，已可想見故鄉的混亂凋敝，民不聊生的狀態！</p>
<p>總之，十年不見的故鄉，已隨着過逝的時光改換面貌了，舊時花香鳥語的農民的樂園，現在已成爲一座悲慘的地獄了。</p>
<h3>三等車中（續）</h3>
<p>— 巴金</p>
<p>平常朋友們在一起大家總有許多話談，這時候我們對坐着，我却覺得說話是一件不容易的事情了。我們讓時間在沈默裏過去，於是Ｖ夫婦下車去了。於是Ｍ也下車走了。接着火車的輪子響動起來。我知道我的旅程又開始了，這時候，對於上海我又生了一點留戀。</p>
<p>車廂裏的人突然加多了，我的被褥被逼迫着捲了起來。睡覺的事變成了一個渺茫的夢，這晚上我就在人堆裏糊裏糊塗地混了一夜，對面一個乘客整夜開着窗，風就對着我吹，煤灰堆滿了我的臉，使得我的眼睛睜不開來。那苦况只有我自己知道，但也終於過去了。</p>
<p>第二天八點以前火車就到了南京江邊。那時正落着雨。早晨的空氣很冷。但我不得不跟着衆人走下車，冒着雨走到江邊的渡輪上，擁擠在前艙裏，給一張帆布篷遮蓋着。</p>
<p>這小火輪一開，風就大起來，把雨點全吹打在我的身上。我只得掉轉身子，但一條褲子却給打濕了。這狼狽的情形如果給朋友們看見，一定會惹起他們的發笑。</p>
<p>到了浦口進了月台，我找不着火車。我站在月台上只覺得身子冷，過了好些難堪的時候，終於看見火車來了。月台上突然變得熱鬧起來。在一陣擁擠之後我進了三等車廂，在那裏面找到了一個好座位，就欣慰地坐下來。籐包給放在頭上的架子上面。我又把被褥在這長椅上攤開，我應該在這車廂裏過一個夜晚了（未完）</p>
<h3>熱情的小孩</h3>
<p>— 哥茫與作鑄瑛釋</p>
<p>－愛是甜蜜的，初愛是更甜蜜的。</p>
<p>孤兒小羅哲是被給病魔纏擾着的老小姐，那自從遭着一些厄運之後，便居在洛安城一條舊街上的一所狹小而又幽暗的房子裏的他的姑母收養着的。他的高齡的祖母和他的姑母一塊過活着。她以她那稍　嚴冷的舊派的方式疼愛小孩，而大部分時間，她埋頭念着杜馬的一本小說，什麽都不管，幾乎與世相遺。羅哲的沉　的孩童時代是在一些衰老的靈魂和陳舊的物件中度過的。</p>
<p>他的姑母的一位朋友卡湃爾夫人，因爲他星期四不上學校，問他這天肯不肯到她家裏去替她丈夫寫信。卡湃爾先生從前是一個海商仲買人，現在眼睛瞎了，長着一嘴白鬍鬚，頗有古時白壽星的風態。他住在洛安高阜上的基約姆森林，住在許多庭園的中間，羅哲能夠得着機會逃出那些愁慘的舊街，超越馬路上的栗樹，向光明的地方登上去，確是一樁快事。</p>
<p>一個適逢聖枝贍禮節（Paques　fleuries）的星期一日，羅哲跑到那些剛給太陽照着的新開的花畫裏去了。他感覺他的心充滿着詩意，他在山腰上回頭一看，那澄碧的大海正從淡紅的桃樹和堆着雪似的李樹的花枝間閃射出藍色的光彩。他發見了大地的壯美。他實在需要青春，在一些老人間生活着的他！他願意在充滿着春色的郊野漫游着，不願跑去關在卡湃爾先生的房裏。但姑母叮囑他要去的；他有着秘書的頭銜，他應當盡他的責任。他感着做了總長的秘書般的驕傲。</p>
<p>他進去的時候，準備了一番話解釋他遲到的原因。但剛入門，一陣哄然的笑聲把他攔住了。他感着驚異。</p>
<p>一個少女，一個高大的耀目的少女立在那兒很頑皮地瞧着他。她把手伸給他：How　areyou，master　Roger？她又笑着：「因爲你總懂得英文罷，秘書先生？」他吃吃地說：QuiteWell，thank　you</p>
<p>四月裏所有的風光都跟着她進來了；在她那鑲着花邊的長袍上，散佈着一些花朶，靠近窗户的一隻藍花瓶裏，幾枝水仙花在爲她盛開着。他微笑，他說話時有着他從來没有的流暢的辭令。他伴着她在園子裡走，在覆盆子的香氣裏面，他談着他的學業，他帶着一種文雅而又誇耀的愉快叙述着在雅典舉行的Minerve女神祭的游行。她瞧着他，對他的話感着興趣，又驚異着：這外省的少年竟懂得這些事嗎！</p>
<p>他回家時，非常高興，現出些兒狂熱的樣子，很興奮地把他一天的經歷告訴他的姑母。「好啦，安靜點罷！夫做你的功課罷！」病人的憔悴的臉上，溜過一絲微笑。</p>
<p>這天，他不曾替卡湃爾先生寫信，卡湃爾先生對他說：「你明天下了課再來罷：但不要像今天這樣在路上胡閙，小東西！」</p>
<p>第二天從學校出來，他便一口氣跑上高阜。白德姑娘在那兒，穿着另一套漂亮的衣裳。他不能夠說出爲什麽那裝束使他覺得漂亮：無疑的，這是那少女本身把那珠灰色的綢上衣襯得那麽高貴。她是從巴黎來的；她帶來了他從没見過的大城市的神秘和神秘的香味。他狠侷促地瞧着自己脚上那隻笨重的鞋子。突然，他感到自己穿得像個窮小子。他凝視着她，她正戀下身子在看一本彫像集，他也把身子灣下；那些戴着戒指的手指，在翻着圖册時，現出一道閃光；那淡金色的頭髮微拂著他的鬚角，他便覺得非常快樂。</p>
<p>他瞧着她的兩眼；她的眼睛旣不像那些故事裏所描繪的那樣藍，也不現得陰暗。她的眼睛是灰色的，可是他却從没見過這樣美麗，這樣大，這樣温柔，這樣天鵝絨般的眼睛。她的眼睛是灰色的，可是這雙眼睛變換並反映着那園子。（未完）</p>

<h3>摧殘文化光漢</h3>
<p>文化是人類的產物，人類又是文化的結晶；因爲人類一面創造文化，一面又被孕育在文化之中。故文化與人類，其關係異常親密而重要。但文化這東西，並非一時一代，或少數人所創成。今日的文化，已是經過千萬年的時間，費盡千萬萬人的心力所造就。蓋後一代的人類，接承前一代人類所遺留下來的文化，不僅要負保存之責，且須增補之，以傳給後一代的人類。文化便是這樣不斷地一代傳遞一代，而蘊成現在這輝煌燦爛的大產物。</p>
<p>依此看來，則文化之於人類，實是最可珍貴的東西了。可是，很不幸，生長在文化胞胎裏的人類，却往往有摧殘文化之事。這眞有點背常。時無古今，地無東西；歷史所載，眼前所見；文化常有遭逢摧殘的厄運。古之，如中國歷史上鼎鼎有名的暴君秦始皇，不就是個摧殘文化的兇手嗎？他不只焚了書，還坑過儒。他視當時的文化簡直是不祥之物，於己有害，便不惜冒天下的大罪名，實行肆意的催殘。這算是中國史上一頁痛心的記載，也可說是漢民族的一大損失！近之，若德國的希特勒，這位被尊爲時代英雄的，也是個文化的大罪人他彷彿像個魔王，對於人類文化，毀滅惟恐不盡；對於文化創造者，惟恐迫害不速。這豈獨是德國的不利，也正是世界的不幸！</p>
<p>論理，人類對於文化，應愛護之，光大之；使後世的人類，得承接更優美的文化，得享受較舒暢的生活：爲什麽還要加以摧殘？倘以質之秦如皇和希特勒，他們的行動，雖自有其所以行動的大道理，甚或正是他們的大得意處，大有爲處；但我們總不能不說，他們都是文化的破壞者，他們都是人類的仇敵！因爲他們儘管一意孤行，暴爲蠻幹；不顧環境，不察民情，不納公意。雖然，還有不少人在稱讚他們的果敢明斷，在崇奉他們爲英主偉有哩！</p>
<p>不過，摧殘文化，尙有别種情形。例如適合某時某地的文化，於另一時另一地，未必亦能通行無阻；在這種塲合，便有人起而排斥之，掃除之，另易一種新文化以代之。蓋文化含有時間性，行於古代的文化，不一定就可行於今代；宜於甲地的文化，不一定亦能宜乙地。這種摧殘，是有意義的，是爲建立新文化而摧殘，於人類是有益的，這呌做文化革命。又如一逢國家發生革命時期，也常有摧殘文化的舉動；這是一種不得已之事，多有可原諒；况眞正革命的目標，爲的也是在乎文化的改造或建設。</p>
<p>至若兩國相爭，或一國侵略他國的時候，對於敵國的文化，當然要盡量與以摧殘。這種暴行，是想制仇人的死命，是一種極慘酷的作爲。爲人類文化計，我們必須羣起而攻擊之，反抗之！</p>
<h3>勝利蘋</h3>
<p>他躑躅在街頭，是黃昏時候。</p>
<p>上海，熱鬧的上海，已跑上牠的尖端。霓紅燈映着接連串的汽車變了顏色，汽車中都市的驕子被燈光照耀着的容光輝發的臉，是站在南京路上貧血色的瞎女乞兒永遠想不到的像另一個世界的人。市招飄蕩在空氣中，被賣良鄉栗子的大鍋子相和着，憶起無限的秋意。人，－從二十四層高樓上望見的蟻羣的人，來，去，鰻一樣的迅速，大都市像一個剛離砲口的巨彈，飛一般旋轉着。</p>
<p>他躑躅在街頭，是黃昏時候。他有張紫紅的臉，一個被酒精刺激過深的腦袋仰起着走路，身上的衣服，一見就使人想起賣油膩肥皂的流浪漢，但是他没有那樣粗大的手，一個純黃種的中國人。</p>
<p>他每天喝酒，跑堂的阿福，已認識了他是個好主顧，他每天掏出一塊錢來從不要阿福的找頭；雖有一回他難有的呌了一個很貴的菜肴，阿福接受了一塊錢之後，說先生還少幾毛錢的時候，被他飛了一掌，但是阿福認爲好主顧是一定的，他對旁的酒客說，他已喝醉了，第二天來的時候，向阿福道謝哩。不過誰都不知道的事。</p>
<p>今天他起來時，已是午後三點鐘，在一個積滿了灰塵的箱篋中他掏出一捲鈔票，他對牆壁說一句：「有這個，怕什麽？」好像有緊要的事情等着他似的，披上油膩的上服跑了。</p>
<p>牆壁上是一張女人的照像，迷人的笑着。</p>
<p>他跑出門，没有更換每天走路的方向，最後還是踏進那家酒店。阿福笑着迎上來：「先生，今天有事？」出望着壁上的時鐘，今天却遲了一個鐘頭。</p>
<p>他佔據了壁角的固定座位，又難有的向阿福呌起那個名貴的菜肴來。</p>
<p>「先生，早賣完了，換一個别的吧」？</p>
<p>阿福雙手靠着桌邊，笑着說話，但是誰都知道他這是假話。</p>
<p>「換一個××××罷。」他點點頭，</p>
<p>說出一個更貴價的萊來。</p>
<p>「先生，這······小店没有的」。</p>
<p>他將一捲鈔票從油膩的上服中掏來一揚「呌來，没有你的事！」平地從座上站起來，把阿福退後了兩步。</p>
<p>「先生，有······有······」</p>
<p>他勝利的笑了。比平時喝了更多的酒。他腦中昏昏然，上半身似乎增加了許多重量，使他的體重不能維持平衡。他站起身來丢了一塊錢，很蠁的一聲，像一個醉鬼投碎酒杯一樣。</p>
<p>「先生，三元六角二哩，」阿福站得遠遠地，錯不多逃避的樣子。</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>他側着頭，稜起三角眼睛，隔一會自己笑了，將鈔票掏出來向阿福招招手，十元的一張在他手中揚着。阿福夠樂了，擰了一條熱的手巾近來，却凑了他的一掌，像前次一樣，他笑着跑了。</p>
<p>「阿福，他明天來向你道謝的！」一個俏皮的酒客說了句幽默話。</p>
<p>他躑躅在街頭，是黃昏時候。</p>
<p>在旋轉的人羣中他是例外的一個，他昻起頭，注視着寥寂的秋空，他好像被大都市擯棄的人，作爲他從到阿福的酒店的第一天算起，整整三個月了。他避免了一切熟識的人，獨自孤居在都市的一角，與他接觸的僅是迷人的笑着底女人的照像。</p>
<p>他走着，走着，那樣的慢，停止在一家跳舞場的門口，他聽見的醉人的音樂，像突然着落了久未解决的答案。整整油膩的上服，挺起胸脯，推着那扇活動的門。這是一家他常到的跳舞場，他跳得很純熟的舞，他能呌出每個舞場著名的舞女，他推進門，衣帽間的Boy驚奇的問：</p>
<p>「朱先生，太太還没有回來？」</p>
<p>「我想再娶一位太太呢！」他點點頭笑着。</p>
<p>他買了很多舞票；像一個痴病的人，他不肯放過每一次的音樂，他呌他熟識的舞女到自己座上來，但是那舞女已不認識他，最後那衣帽間的Boy授意了。</p>
<p>「赤老，」那「再娶一位太太」在舞女耳畔聽過之後，她把整個身體滾到他的懷中「怪模怪樣的嚇死人！」</p>
<p>「曼莉，做我的太太好不？」他撫着曼莉的臉，一面摸摸自己毛茸茸的鬚根</p>
<p>「你的太太呢？」呌曼莉的斜乜着眼迷人的笑着。</p>
<p>「太太嫁了小白臉！」</p>
<p>········</p>
<p>這一度談判之後，他已攫了曼莉到自己的懷中來。</p>
<p>是一間富麗堂后的臥室，某大旅社的七層樓上。他擁抱着曼莉的肉體，得意的笑着－三個月來他僅有的一次笑；</p>
<p>那樣自然，那樣快意。</p>
<p>他隨即來完成答案的尾聲，很快的推去那團肉體，跳下床來，披上油膩的上服，掏出那捲鈔票，向床頭抛去。</p>
<p>「你們女人也有屈服的一天！」</p>
<p>曼莉在極度興奮的疲乏中，舉起惺忪的睡眼，早不見了他的影踪，她掀起被窩，被鈔票掩上她赤裸的肉體，她笑着把鈔票揀集攏來，一個翻身，又尋她的好夢。</p>
<p>從此，黃昏時候，不見他躑躅在街頭。</p>
<h3>都市的清晨因</h3>
<p>不知誰家蓄着雄雞兒，在靜寂的秋之晨的空氣裏，很清脆的呌出「喔喔，家家紅」的調子來。啊！又是一天的開始了。路旁清道夫剷着垃圾，隆隆的在柏油路上滾着。我跳下床來，没有着衣，只有背心，短褲，拖鞋，赤了腿，向大門裏奔出來。我就在這靜的都市的清晨的空氣裏，深深地呼吸了一口。</p>
<p>「嗚······」呵！那是大房子工廠屋頂上筆直的像鼻管的汽笛呌出來的聲音呀！它在催促着勞働者們進去工作呀！我一口氣跑過到那邊馬路的盡頭，看，呵，眞熱鬧呀！三三兩兩，成羣結隊的男女們，有的衣裳披着，紐子没紐，有的還赤着膊，指手畫脚，希裏花拉的在談着，笑着，也有在唱着······呵，越來越多了，怎麽趟不完的，看，那邊還，十三四歲的，十七八歲的，梳辮子的，截髮的大姑娘呀！怪夠味兒的，她們都提着籃，挾了包，嘴巴裏在嚼着大餅，短短的，細細的腿兒加勁地在揮動着，有的苦着臉，有的浮着笑。是呵，她們深怕就在今天自己會給機器整個的吃掉，同時心裏又在自慰着「今天肚子不會鬧恐慌了」。</p>
<p>走着，過去，過去，過去一羣，又是一隊。心裏想，你們總有走完的時候呀！哈哈，眞的囉，終於你們走完了吧！呵！呵！那邊又來了！看，來的是瘦弱的，菜色的，像柴，像架子！呵！呵！怎樣的？我的眼睛竟忽然如此昏花起來了嗎？甚麽那邊角落裏拖着兩條腿動着的一個，也像是一個生物嗎？他也是這隊伍裏的一員嗎？這不禁呌我代他握着一把汗了······</p>
<p>「嗚······，」呵，大房子頂上的鼻管子還是啞着聲音呌着，它的大張開了的大嘴的門，還是没有關閉着，我心裏想：已經吞進去了這一大羣羣的男的女的，大的小的，老的少的，瘦的肥的，笑着的苦着的，那麽，難道它還没有吃飽嗎？不然，它還在等待甚麽呢？</p>
<p>「喔喔，家家紅，」仍舊不知是誰家蓄着的雄雞兒，在這剛才騷動了一番而現在又靜寂的秋之晨的空氣裏嘶着聲音喊呌着。呵，又是一天的開始了。但是怎麽的？連一個高帽的，挺肚的先生，紳士的影兒都不看見呢？我懷疑了：原來都市的清晨只是爲這些短衣，赤膊，菜色面龐的勞慟者們而有的嗎？···</p>
<p>···我再在這靜的都市的清晨的空氣裏深深地呼吸了一口。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我家的境况，本來是可以過得去的。不幸我的母親死了，我的父親就娶了一位繼母。不料她非常虐待我，逼我到這裏來做學徒。</p>
<p>在這裏每天自清早五時起，一直到夜裏十一點鐘，簡直没有一刻鐘放你坐定的。這樣長時間的工作，加之食住又壞，我的腦海中，不由你不被灰色的恐怖籠罩着。</p>
<p>我時常想去補習，但是這樣的工作，那裏還會有精神？我眞想不出法子了！先生，你是旁觀者清，或許會有好的方法，請你指示一下吧！專肅即請</p>
<p>撰安黃秉珩謹上</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>編者按：據黃君來信所說的口氣，似乎他的父親，原有更進一步培植他的能力，徒因繼母的唆使，忍令他的兒子，在體力智力都還没有長足的時候，來到社會上受這過量的磨折。如其所言是實，那末當可以向你父親懇求，希望他有回心的一天。不過在這種年頭，要供給子女受高等敎育，决非中人以下的人家所能勝任。不要你觀察不清，錯怪了老父：據我們看來，或許他見你受苦。說不定也在背後掉淚呢！此外一個人處逆境，貴乎要在勇敢奮鬥之餘，有安之若素的態度。没有勇氣奮鬥，固足以自墮志氣；然不能安貧甘苦，也會影響到個人的志氣的。佔現社會最大多數的處逆境者，幸三復斯言。</p>

<h3>戰爭與和平（三五）（四幕劇）凌鶴</h3>
<p>第三幕和平禮讚</p>
<p>學良的不抵抗，湯玉麟的違抗命令，顯而易見的都是爲了要保全實力。誰不知外侮不如內爭，內戰的時候，如想保全實力，或者還做得到，若是現在和Ｈ本打，也要保全實力，那末就等於揖盜入門。這不是笑話嗎？所以我上次在天津對學生演說：現在的軍人，假使想得着國人的愛戴，那末必定要抱定犧牲的精神，堅决抗日。這就是聖經上所說的：「欲得爾之生命，必捨去爾之生命。」······</p>
<p>機要秘書：原來校長對聖經到滿有研究。</p>
<p>校長：呃，聖經這東西，的確是一部好書。······所以，說句大胆的話；現在中央軍連日的撤退，積極停戰，在外面到底有許多人不滿。</p>
<p>機要秘書：國民滿意不滿意，到是另外的一個問題。現在我祗顧事實，我問你在這種情形之下，除了停戰，除了直接交涉以外，還有什麽方法可想呢？老百姓，他們懂得什麽？</p>
<p>校長：這不能這樣說······</p>
<p>軍事當局：我看我們不談這個了吧。···</p>
<p>···近來北方大學辦得怎樣？學校的經費很充足嗎？</p>
<p>校長：是的呀，就是學校的經費大不充足，簡直没有法兒辦好。加之近年來的學生思想日益過激，時常鬧風潮。就拿這次停戰的事件來說罷，他們一聽到這風聲，馬上學校到處發現過激的傳單標語。你看罷，祇要我們一不留心，馬上便是鬧得不成話的。</p>
<p>軍事當局：可不是，你們辦學校的也不容易。我看還是來給我們帮帮忙吧。到我們這裏做一個顧問怎麽樣？</p>
<p>校長：不敢不敢。不過部長肯這樣栽培我，眞是感激之至。</p>
<p>軍事當局：好說好說，像你正是國家不可多得的人材，在這內憂外患的時，政府自非借重奇才不可。</p>
<p>校長：不敢當，不敢當。可是在這時候，國家應當提拔眞才到是眞的。所謂亂世出英雄，譬如說像這裏假如這時候没有部長在親自親鎭壓處理一切，那末簡直就要鬧得不成樣子子。所以說，當和則和，當戰則戰，大丈夫能進能退，能屈能伸，爲國留原氣，省却許多無味的犧牲，正是高明的見解。英雄的本色。</p>

<h3>中國電影藝人訪問記（四）（續本月廿四日）</h3>
<p>— 沙基</p>
<p>（二）「自由之花」導演鄭正秋（上）</p>
<p>「九一八」的狂風暴雨過去了，我冷清清的走到慕爾鳴路去訪問道位中國電影界的前輩鄭正秋。</p>
<p>一幢古舊的石庫房子，假使這剥脫了油漆的大門上看去，你不難認出這房屋老大的年齡。我想它如坐落在租界熱鬧區域的話，那末少不了是要從新翻造的；幸而它是生長在這裏。依照上海「請走後門」的慣例，我打後門進去，雖然這大門上並没有貼着如此字樣的紙條。踏着客堂中的紅色花磚，我坐在那紅木椅上等着，等着······那譚延闓寫的朱聯照在我的眼前。那字的筆勁並不見何等了不起，不過看他的名字却總有點寒慓。原來偉人或英雄都是很可怕的東西。祇要想起他生前的一品當朝和死後的全國舉哀，便覺得自己眞渺小得太不成話了。</p>
<p>其後一個矮小清瘦的中年男子在我面前出現了。他戴了一付光圈很深的近視眼睛，假如以漫畫來表現，只消多畫上幾道圓圈好了。</p>
<p>彼此都很爽直，用不着照例的謙恭。當我聲明來意之後，馬上言歸本傳。好在他也不是政治巨頭，所以不必書面問答。以下便是他談話的大意：</p>
<p>「我覺得現在中國的導演，一般的有兩個缺點：一，没有正確的社會認識。即是說，對於世界情勢和社會現狀，都不能下意的去體念和了解。這樣，在作品中所表現的自然是貧薄得很。不過，這可以請前進的劇作家帮助。假如有了好的故事，導說仍可得力不少。甚至於在工作時間，也可以請朋友帮助。二，一般的對於導演技巧，也不甚考究。事實有許多因爲方法的錯誤，以致放鬆了劇本中好的意識。然而這不是可以借助於人的，必須自己做一番眞的工夫。除了經常的注意到社會上各種人羣的生活狀况，還得在外國影片中去學習和體念。關於這一點，我很佔了一點便宜，因爲自己曾有十多年的舞臺經騐的原故。我懂得觀衆的心理，觀衆需要什麽，我便給他什麽。我以爲一個導演，必須要有豐富的人生經騐，對於一切生活的小部份，都應注意，否則便减輕了劇本的少量了。」（未完）</p>

<p>假如我們來一個比較恰當的評語給這「她的保鏢」，那末是「哼，這個片子倒還有趣。」爲什麽要這樣說呢？你看罷，這個故事就很有趣。有個富翁和一個後台老板同時追求一個女伶人，彼此鈎心鬥角，爭相求愛於女伶。富翁代女伶僱一保鑣，企圖監視她的行動。結果，二人均無所得，女伶終爲年青的保鑣所奪去。</p>
<p>自然，這是譏諷的。在劇的展露之下，女伶常爲新聞記者或後台第板所包圍，同時，富翁們亦不免垂涎欲滴，名女伶在他們眼中無非是一種玩物而已。可是作者對這女伶到底愛惜，於是給她一個機緣，認識了年青活潑的保鑣。而且這保鑣又是天才的美術家，所以藝術家配藝術家，剛好合式，一方面可看出這故事本身的「發鬆」，另一方面可證明美國作家，眞是題材缺乏之後的異想天開，居然想出一個這樣的故事。（其實並不是題材缺乏，而且放着現成的題材不去運用。）所以這是美國劇作者無聊得好笑。</p>
<p>有了發鬆的故事，必定要有發鬆的演出。在這一點上，導演的手法更是成功。劇的開頭便是有趣的塲面。兩個醉人走進酒排間，一交跌倒，四隻脚並在一道，認不出那一雙是自己的脚。自然這是合得上幽默二字的。在雪尼霍特的作品中，也曾有過同樣的運用。至於是否學習雪尼霍特，那就不得而知了。</p>
<p>然而，無論如何導演是好的。編輯上的有條不亂，固然是導演最低限度的條件，不過在這裏有着更明確的系統。此外是有趣，幾乎是每一個塲面都有趣。尤其是在火車中當女伶跟保鑣走後，富翁只得抱住另一女伶大笑，眞是令人笑出眼淚來。</p>
<p>在演員方面，我以爲這是埃德門羅空前的成績。雖然他在這裏戲並不多，可是都很發鬆而活潑。可是最後在鐵軌上走的一塲却不見佳，（這也導演失當之處，根本這個劇就應當在富翁大笑時完結。）其次那飾女伶的葳鸞吉波森，却和那另一女伶一樣，過於做作。那個新聞記者也是很好的。</p>
<h3>「興登堡血戰記」評</h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>誰都知道在目前軍縮會議的失敗，是軍備競賽的成功。經濟會議的破產，是暴力决鬥的警號，國際局勢，已經到了極度緊張的地步。一件極微小極偶然的事情，都能爆發最殘酷最悽慘的世界戰爭，同樣要使全世界大多數民衆陷入死亡和饑餓的阱中。事實是極明白的，每一個國家都集中力量擴軍備，集中經濟，作孤注的一擲。同時在精神上，只要能夠鼓動民衆戰爭興趣，組織民衆戰爭意識的，都竭力的提倡！於是人道主義的反戰作品「西綫無戰爭」小說和影片，到處遭到禁止，而「興登堡血戰史」開映了！</p>
<p>故事是取材於歐洲大戰東部的一節史實，德皇起用棄將興登堡而逐出勢如破竹的俄軍，同時更把上尉亞諾的殉國，穿插貫串起來。</p>
<p>在影片中極寫德軍的勇敢，興登堡之計謀，這點在戰敗後的德國民衆氣挫之時，的確是一服興奮劑。特别是興登堡是現在的總統，更可以使德國民衆膽壯，起來準備第二次大戰，這點，在最近的報紙德國鋼盔黨徒公開宣言：「假使第一次大戰再延長下去，那末，勝利必歸德國，可恨議員搆和云云」，不是一個有力的證據嗎？所以「興登堡血戰記，是徹頭徹尾的鼓動戰爭的影片！」</p>
<p>這裏一定有人反問：第一，「興登堡血戰爭記」，是過去的史實；第二，「興登堡血戰記」可以說是純新聞片，是否「史實」的「新聞片，」也有積極作用呢</p>
<p>我們知道同樣一個「史實，」但因爲叙述者的觀點不同，而可以有兩種極端相反的結論和效果，即以第一次大戰論，眞正反對戰爭者，他一定要特别表現出戰爭的罪惡，和民衆反對戰爭的舉動，尤其是誰是戰爭的主持者和有利者，如此，則看這種影片的人，一定明瞭戰爭的本質，而反對他，現在「興登堡血戰記，」一方面描寫德軍的勇敢，一方面更描寫興登堡的智謀，當然觀衆們是會受他鼓動戰爭的應響了</p>
<p>當然，上尉亞諾是在方欲趨袒愛女的時候，中槍而死，這一點，相當表現出戰爭的痛苦，但結果，東普士人民追懷忠勇戰士爲樹立戰功碑，而興登堡大總統亦躬逢其盛，把這一個痛苦用壯烈光榮掩蓋住了。好一個對死者欺騙，對生者誘惑！</p>
<p>說到技術，自然因爲「興登堡血戰記」有新聞片插入，所以有很多地方調子不很統一，而演員表現也因爲故事的波瀾太起伏，而忽略了很多小節·「大進攻」是完全新聞片，「興登堡血戰記」當然比較好看了。特别是德國軍官的威風的確是大屠夫的面相，我在寫稿的時候還時時的浮在腦裏！</p>
<h3>徐來的處女作「殘春」</h3>
<p>— 靜觀</p>
<p>被稱爲東方標準美人的徐來女士，雖然在電影界裏還是個初出茅廬的小妹妹，可是她的地位和一般新進演員有點兒不同。第一，是因爲她本來是幹歌舞的，在舞台上的成功早已獲得不少觀衆。第二，她原來就是上海的交際明星。</p>
<p>她的「處女作」「殘春」的主題是在暴露資產階級女性的荒淫糜爛的生活形態。徐來就飾了劇中的一位千金小姐。男主角有龔稼農，鄭小輪般的圍繞着她的左右。導演者爲張石川。</p>
<p>從過去徐女士在歌舞上的成功，以及她所飾的角色的適合上，我們猜想大槪不會使觀衆失望。至於究竟成績如何？等公映後再給它公正的批評罷！</p>
<h3>兩聲片同時進行</h3>
<p>鄭正秋導演之「貴人與犯人」正在繼續攝製中，以工作之審愼，預期一個月內可告成功者，已不得不延至三個月，鄭導演自謂此係别闢蹊徑之力作，成績必可駕「自由之花」而上之同時進行。該片外景全部採自青島，景物之美，足與美片中之南海風光相比。大槪新春時節，該兩片卽可相繼出映。</p>

<h3>鏡花水月Three-Cornered　Moon（四）</h3>
<p>— 波倫</p>
<p>斯提芬醫生點點頭，很贊成伊麗莎白的話。伊麗莎白問道：「你說我們賣掉這所房子怎麽樣？」斯提芬想了一想，搖著頭道：「局面不對了。在這經濟彫　的時候，誰要這所房子。要是留了這所房子，你們還可以藏藏身。不過，樓上的那些空屋子，照我想，與其留在那裡作白相房間，不如把他們賃給人家的好。我可以租一間住住，橫豎我是一個單身人，到處要租房子住的。伊麗莎白聽了斯提芬冷靜的言語，心裡寒了半截，這纔嘗著没有錢的滋味。她和著她母親酒櫉裡的銀器，壁爐上的大鏡子，地上的厚氈，祖傳的大自鳴鐘。這些都是錢。錢就是温暖，食物，和舒適。冬天燒的煤，盆子裡的牛扒，都要錢買的。錢亦就是美麗。於是她又想到龍那德的身上，使他亦連帶受到苦難，怎麽對得住他。他必須得無憂無慮，纔可以有美麗的創作出來－「暴風急雨，雷聲隆隆」之類。</p>
<p>肯納斯氣瘋了，跳了起來道：「租去一間屋子有什麽用？讓子塌下來好了！倒霉了，索興讓牠倒到底。我不再在家裡住了！」斯提芬一把將他抓住了，可是伊麗莎白亦跳了起來道，讓他去好了。我們大家去，我们大家手携手往河裏跳吧！」斯提芬大聲喊道「大家靜些。你們這羣孩子，實在瘋狂得太久了。不過這是千鈞一髮的時候，你們難道還不用腦筋，打打主意嗎？」伊麗莎白說：「你有什麽主意呢？」斯提芬道：「你們拿一切値錢的東西，都賣了。賣得的錢，統通交給伊麗莎白。讓她管着賬，支票亦由她簽字。」</p>
<p>林柏加太太作了苦臉道：「我還是一家之主呀，支票怎不給我簽呢？」斯提芬告誡她道：「這次就譬如公司開董事會，所商量的，就是舊經理告退了，推舉新經理。以後的財政，你就可以不用管了。」林柏加太太凄慘得哭了起來道：「我是一家之主，怎麽不給我簽字呢？」伊麗莎白拍着她的肩胛道：「你别鬧了，以後斯提芬醫生付房錢的收據，歸你簽好了。」斯提芬又宣佈道：「其餘的，你們一定要去尋工做。」這句話把林柏加的全部都上了電了。島格拉斯跌了起來道：「琴妮威爾許認識一個戲院公會的董事。」他立卽去打電話給琴呢。肯納斯亦翻着報紙，尋那僱傭欄，藹弟順手地，習慣成自然地將留聲機器開了。</p>
<p>伊麗莎白聽見樓梯上急驟的脚步聲。龍那德已經站在門口。他很高興地看着伊麗莎白道：「伊麗莎白，已經有了。這章的的結束，再好没有了。」伊麗莎白迎了上去。門口的風很凉，伊麗莎白將衣襟裹緊些，心裡覺得奇怪，怎麽錢没有了，身上就冷得這樣快？於是她想到肚子已經餓了半天。她連帶杨到奧特曼的咖啡，但是她連坐電車的錢都没有，怎麽出去呢？</p>

<p>期待已久的，希特拉之德國影界救濟計畫終於最近發表了。救濟計畫包含設立一電影銀行（Film　Bank），以最低的利率，貸借與困於經濟恐慌之影片公司，以爲製作聲片之用。聞該銀行之資本，逹數千萬之鉅。</p>
<p>據該行負責人聲稱，德國全境每年需要聲片二十萬本左右，而國內各公司每年祇能製作十五萬本，其餘五萬本聲片，惟有仰給於外國片之輪入。故希特拉總理爲欲使外國片滅跡於國境內起見，設立此電影銀行。銀行之職務在於貸與各小公司以三分之二之製作聲片之費用。極端奬勵全國各影片公司之多量產額，務使逹到補足所缺乏之五萬本聲片爲止云云。</p>
<p>由此我們可以知道，不久的將來，外國片將要在德境絶跡了。</p>

<h3>Fang Zhenwu's Troops Attacked Gaoliying and Were Repelled</h3>
<p>Government troops were restrained by the agreement and did not pursue</p>
<p>Ji's troops made contact with government troops in Niufang</p>
<p>Fang and Ji's troops combined and moved southwest</p>
<p>The fighting seems likely to focus on the Tangshan area</p>
<p>Japanese troops say Fang and Ji have withdrawn from the demilitarized zone and are temporarily taking a monitoring stance</p>
<p>One account says Fang's troops withdrew to near Huairou, plotting another move toward Pingdong</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military dispatch from Baxianzhuang: Fang's troops, numbering about 1,000, moved south from Niulanshan yesterday. Around 6 PM, they raided Gaoliying, intending to flee south. They were intercepted by the garrison, resulting in fierce fighting. By dawn today, the troops were unable to hold and retreated, now stationed in Banqiao Village, 15 li north of Gaoliying. Due to the ceasefire agreement, our troops refrained from pursuit. Both sides are currently in a standoff. Tongzhou dispatch: This afternoon, a small detachment of Fang's troops infiltrated Lishuiqiao, about 30 li north of Pingbei, and clashed with a unit of the 25th Division stationed there, before retreating. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The main force of Fang Zhenwu's troops is concentrated in the areas of Banqiao, Dongshuiquan, and Xishuiquan. Fang himself is stationed in Xishuiquan. After retaking Gaoliying, local troops did not pursue due to its proximity to the demilitarized zone. Furthermore, a full encirclement was deemed impractical. The plan is to move the front line to the Koukou area to lure Fang's troops deeper. However, Fang's troops, aware of our preparations, dare not advance south. This afternoon, a detachment of Fang's troops again attacked Gaoliying from across the river ditch, one li northwest of Gaoliying, using guns and artillery. Our troops returned fire. At the same time, a portion of Fang's troops also raided the Koumian defense line, with intermittent artillery fire. Fang's troops are engaging in these diversionary tactics to cover the westward movement of a large portion of their rear troops. By this evening, Fang's troops had reached Niufang, four li from Daxiao Tangshan, and made contact with Ji's troops there. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ji Hongchang's troops occupied Niufang, four li east of Tangshan, last night, making contact with the government troops' Wang battalion. Another unit bypassed and advanced to Chawu in Changping County, north of Tangshan, and made contact with the government troops' Zhu division. From last night until this evening, gunfire never ceased, and the fighting was quite intense. Tonight, the combined forces of Fang and Ji, totaling over 3,000 men, are likely to flee westward together. The fighting is expected to focus on the Daxiao Tangshan area. Local troops have deployed heavy forces to defend and block the area. The Japanese military considered today the deadline for Fang's troops to leave the war zone. On the 26th, 200 Japanese soldiers were dispatched from Miyun to Niulanshan to prevent Fang's troops from fleeing east. So far, because Fang's troops are successively moving west, no action has been taken against Fang's troops. According to the Japanese side, they are temporarily adopting a monitoring stance. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A military agency received a report from the front line that Fang's troops, due to the failed attack on Gaoliying, withdrew to the vicinity of Qiaozizun, Nanbeishicao Village in Huairou County at 3:00 PM today, leaving a small number of troops active in the front, and planning another move toward Pingdong. The authorities have strictly ordered the garrisons in Shunyi and Tong County to be on high alert. There are no enemy traces within 11 or 12 li northeast of Gaoliying. Because Ji's troops are harassing the first line of Wan Jun's forces, constantly threatening them with artillery fire, Ji's troops in Datangshan plan to advance towards Changping. The 32nd Regiment of the Japanese army in Miyun has not moved towards Huairou. According to the Japanese side, Fang and Ji's troops have withdrawn from Huairou city, so there is no need to dispatch troops to drive them out. Due to Fang and Ji's troops using small units to carry out guerrilla warfare, local battles are occurring at any time in various places. Our army has a very solid defense around Beiping. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Gaoliying</h3>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, two Japanese planes flew over Gaoliying and dropped two bombs, killing two soldiers of our Zhao Regiment and wounding three. Zhao, the regimental commander, said that around 4:00 AM on the 26th, Fang's troops, taking advantage of our troops' changing of guard, ordered Dong Mengwu of his Wang army, with about 1,000 men, to attack Gaoliying. Several hundred soldiers of the Dong Regiment entered the east gate, and our army entered the west gate, resulting in street fighting. The two sides were only dozens of meters apart. The fighting was most intense until noon, and then eased off slightly in the afternoon. In the evening, there was only intermittent gunfire. Japanese planes dropped two bombs in the Fang's troops defenses in Dongxi Shuiquan yesterday. In this battle, our army suffered five or six deaths and dozens of injuries. Fang's troops suffered more than a hundred deaths and several prisoners were taken, wearing armbands bearing the Fourth Army designation of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, with the words "Sacrifice to Resist Japan and Eliminate Corruption" written on them. This morning, Fang's troops suddenly split into two routes and retreated, one to the northeast and one to the north. Ji's troops are now entrenched in Qinjiashan Shangyuan Xiayuan Dongxi Xincun and other places northwest of Gaoliying, seemingly wanting to advance towards Daxiao Tangshan. Yesterday, there were four or five hundred cavalry and five or six hundred infantry of Ji's troops, who contacted the Wang battalion stationed locally. There was no battle this morning. Northwest to near Changping is still Ji's troops, who contacted our Zhu division last night, and the battle has not ceased this morning. Fang and Ji's intentions have not been fully determined. The officers and soldiers of each line are completely prepared, and the security of Beiping need not be worried. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The detailed situation of yesterday's battle in Gaoliying is gradually being reported. A squadron of Fang's cavalry rushed into Gaoliying, hoping to break in. Three hundred government troops rose up to resist, and after a long street fight, they besieged and defeated them. The government troops only suffered one death and ten injuries. The main force of Fang's troops seems to be preparing for battle in Banqiao, slightly north of Gaoliying, which is still within the demilitarized zone. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Chinese newspaper reported that the Japanese army did not wait for the expiration of the ultimatum and immediately sent four planes to drop bombs near Gaoliying, causing many casualties to Fang's troops. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This place, a Japanese official, confirmed that the Japanese military authorities did not want to attack Fang's troops in the demilitarized zone, because they wanted to avoid unnecessary bloodshed to the local people. According to Chinese sources, Ji's troops are gradually retreating from the Tangshan ceasefire line, and do not seem to be surrendering. However, if they attack, the government troops plan to resist. According to Chinese sources, two Japanese military planes flew to the Gaoliying ceasefire line this morning and dropped two bombs, killing two officers and soldiers and wounding three others. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Military Branch Orders All Armies to Strictly Defend</h3>
<p>(Beiping) At this morning's regular meeting of the Military Branch, Wan Fulin, Shang Zhen, Rong Zhen, Jiang Bocheng, and others, chaired by He Yingqin, reported on yesterday morning's clash between Fang's troops and Li Battalion of the 119th Division. It was stated that the main force of Fang's troops, about two to three thousand men, was entrenched in the Banqiao and Dongxi Shuiquan Villages north of Gaoliying. After yesterday's clash, fighting continued until dawn before a ceasefire. Two regiments of the 129th Division arrived and surrounded Fang's troops. Unable to withstand, Fang's troops split into two routes and fled, one to the northeast and one directly north, and fled into the demilitarized zone. Our army did not pursue and is currently strictly defending. Next, Wan reported that Ji's troops, about two thousand men, were in the Daxiao Tangshan area northwest of Gaoliying. Yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, fighting broke out with the 130th Division and is still ongoing this afternoon. After Wan's report, He reported that according to Yin Tong's report from the Japanese side, Fang and Ji's troops were being pressured by the National Army and had fled towards Tongzhou. After discussion by the attending committee members, it was decided to order all armies to strictly defend. Then they discussed the proposals and decided to pass the organizational outline of the Financial Management and Supervision Committee, and decided to set up ten committee members. The names of the chairman and committee members have not yet been determined. There were also many cases of rectifying the military discipline of various departments and other routine cases. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Tang Yulin Expresses Non-Participation</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Military news: Tang Yulin sent his Chief of Staff Wang Hongru to Ping on the 27th. He immediately went to Jurentang to meet with He, stating that his army was still stationed in its original location and had nothing to do with Fang and Ji's troops. Rumors that Tang's troops were cooperating with Fang and Ji were completely unfounded. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram received by the Ministry of the Army, Liu Guitang's army in Dushikou has been appointed by He Yingqin as the Commander-in-Chief of the Chahar Bandit Suppression. Tang Yulin also does not intend to advance. Therefore, Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang's troops, about 8,000 (actually only 2,000), who moved from Huairou towards Shunyi, are completely isolated. Therefore, they can naturally collapse within a few days. (Dentsu dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Fang's Telegram to He Contains Vague Language</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Zhenwu sent a telegram to He, stating in essence that if there is a political solution, everything can be discussed, the wording extremely vague. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Zhenwu has sent representatives to various parties for liaison in recent days, and representatives from Pingfang have also arrived, conveying Fang's intentions to the authorities, expressing his willingness to leave the army. However, whether he is sincere or has other intentions is still unclear. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Have Reached Niulanshan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Shunyi telegram: Yesterday morning at 1:00 AM, Fang's troops set out from Niulanshan in two directions, east and south. Before dawn, more than 100 Japanese soldiers arrived at Niulanshan, but there has been no action so far. Also, yesterday morning around 11:00 AM, two Japanese planes came to the county for reconnaissance, circling the city twice, flew east, and dropped many leaflets, mainly to drive Fang's troops to quickly withdraw outside the demilitarized zone, otherwise the Japanese army would attack them. Around 1:00 PM in the afternoon, another Japanese plane came to reconnoiter for several weeks and flew east. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A telegram from Beiping: Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang's troops fled from Niulanshan to Gaoliying and Tangshan last night and this morning. Fang's troops clashed with Wan Fulin's 129th Division in Gaoliying and suffered heavy casualties due to the division's fierce shooting. Later, they tried to flee to Sanhe, but were blocked by Shang Zhen's army and are now trapped with no way to go. Gaoliying has been taken over by the Central Army. Ji Hongchang's troops have entered Tangshan and have been discovered by a unit of the 130th Division stationed there. Since morning, they are still in contact. The two sides are currently in a standoff. (Dentsu dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Officers Go to the Front for Inspection</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese barracks stationed in Ping sent a captain-level military officer and two attendants this afternoon at 1:00 PM, accompanied by a member of the Military Branch, to leave Pingbei and go directly to Gaoliying to inspect everything. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Whether Fang Zhenwu's army has withdrawn from the demilitarized zone, the Japanese army stationed in Ping sent a staff officer Cheng Fangshi to inspect the area from the south. The staff officer has departed from Ping accompanied by a Chinese military officer at 2:00 PM today to rush to Gaoliying. (Japan United News dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Fang and Ji's Troops Will Move Southwest</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Beiping: The Fang and Ji allied forces are now surrounded on all sides, with the Japanese army to the north in Niulanshan and the Central Army to the east, west, and south, and have fallen into heavy encirclement. Therefore, their main force of about 6,000 is eager to find a way to escape. Because the Central Army cannot attack within the demilitarized zone, they plan to escape along the demilitarized agreement line at night and flee to the west Nanjing-Suiyuan line. Also, since this morning, in Gaoliying, after being fiercely attacked by the Central Army, a part of Fang Zhenwu's army, which abandoned Sanhe and fled, has fled into Tongzhou. However, from Tongzhou to Shunyi, there is Shang Zhen's army on high alert, and of course, it will be wiped out by Shang's troops. (Dentsu dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Kwantung Army believes that if Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang's troops are defeated when they flee from Niulanshan, they will inevitably join with the bandit gangs in Luandong, which will lead to an expansion of the situation. It has decided to prevent this and drive them to the southwest. Therefore, the exit route for Fang and others outside the demilitarized zone will be from the Ping-Sui line, Changping Nankou, to put pressure on them and make them flee to Shanxi. (Dentsu dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army issued a public statement today stating that Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang's armies have withdrawn from the demilitarized zone of North China at the request of the Kwantung Army. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The demilitarized zone was still peaceful this morning, and there was no news from the sections about to go to war. The authorities were silent about the measures for the Chinese and Japanese sides to negotiate the handling of Fang's army. According to outside rumors, the Japanese side has negotiated with the Military Commission branch to force Fang's army to move to the ceasefire line, and the government army will confiscate their weapons, giving a small amount of money for each gun. However, whether Fang's army will comply is still a question. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to the latest news from the Japanese side here, the Japanese military authorities are closely watching Fang's actions, but will temporarily stand by. It is heard that Fang's troops are currently moving west, the implication of which is unknown. Whether they will be attacked or disarmed when they reach the ceasefire line guarded by the government army is still a question. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Liushouying is Occupied by Bandits</h3>
<p>Two thousand bandits in Fucheng are commanded by Guo Yazhou</p>
<p>Changli, 27th: Changcheng is relatively peaceful, but rumors are rampant. In the morning, more than 20 Japanese soldiers reconnoitered in various places in Chang, lingering for a long time before leaving. It is reported that a part of the scattered bandits is only ten miles away from the city, but the number of people is very small and not enough to cause trouble. In recent days, unscrupulous elements in Changcheng have had some kind of attempt, and have secretly sent personnel to Qin to conduct secret activities. If there are no proper measures within days, the situation is quite worrying. The streets have been deserted for days, the rich have all gone west, and most of the shops are closed. The authorities have issued a general order to open up as usual, and strictly prohibit the transfer of goods to stabilize people's hearts. At the same time, the local regiments were transferred to form a close joint defense. The aid team arrived in Chang and then returned to Fucheng, where there are currently about 2,000 bandits under the command of Guo Yazhou. Zhang Kuiyuan is reportedly still in Tianjin, contacting a certain party to plot a major operation. According to another report, more than 100 bandits in neat military uniforms were suddenly discovered in Qian'an, the source is unknown, and Liushouying has been occupied, but the Beining train is still running as usual. (Telecommunications dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the bandit gang Lao Haozi captured Funing, the situation has expanded. Our side, because a Japanese person, Kunihiro Ryokichi, claiming to be the police chief of the pseudo-state, existed before Funing fell, we feared involving diplomacy, so we initially withdrew. After our side inquired with the Japanese side, the Japanese military officer Shibayama replied to our side, stating that according to a telegram from the 16th Division, the Kunihiro Ryokichi was not a Japanese, but a Chinese named Shi Wenbing impersonating, etc. According to this, our side believes that Shi's troops and Lao Haozi are both bandit troops, and has ordered the Hebei Provincial Government to quickly dispatch security teams to restore Funing, and transfer orders to various counties, pay attention to this matter in the future. Liu Xingpei, the magistrate of Funing who arrived in Tianjin, will go to Changli within days to supervise the recovery of Funing. Yin Tong sent Su Yuqi to Tianjin to meet with Yu and negotiate the bandit suppression matters, and then transferred to Yuguan from Tianjin today to have some contact with the Japanese army there. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Zeyi said that the issues of liaising with the bandit suppression in Luandong, etc., that I had previously discussed in Tianjin have gradually been settled, and I have also met with He and reported everything. Last night, I suddenly received a telegram from Huang summoning me to Shanghai, and I now plan to take a detour south from Tianjin, staying in Tianjin for one day to contact Yu about the security team going to Luandong to suppress bandits. The organization of the security team has now been settled, with a quota of 2,000 men, and all can depart in the next few days and go to the war zone to suppress bandits. The issue of Fang and Ji, etc., is currently being negotiated with the Japanese side and can be resolved soon. I can return to Ping at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Zeyi went to Tianjin this morning to negotiate with the Japanese side about the Tanggu incident and the bandit suppression issue in Funing. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu telegraphed Jiang Bocheng, saying that the situation in Pingbei is critical and he is deeply anxious. He has been in Shanghai in recent days, in close consultation with the Japanese side to ease the situation. As soon as he replies, he will immediately go north. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Tanggu Provoke Wantonly</h3>
<p>Occupy the Public Security Bureau and Open Machine Guns</p>
<p>Want Our Side to Compensate and Apologize</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese soldiers stationed in Tanggu drove out the street police and occupied the Public Security Bureau. The situation on the evening of the 26th was extremely serious. When the Japanese soldiers opened machine guns, one policeman was injured. We still endured it. At 12 o'clock at night, our 51st Army Headquarters sent staff officer Guan Huotian, and the Japanese Army Headquarters sent staff officer Ohashi to Tanggu to jointly investigate. According to Yu Xuezhong's words, the reporter can hopefully resolve it peacefully. The Japanese Army Headquarters also said that the situation would not escalate, but requested that our side compensate and apologize. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In the Tanggu incident of Japanese troops making trouble while drunk, the Japanese side actually believes that our side insulted the Japanese army, so they are making a show of force. On the 26th, they sent armed soldiers to occupy the Tangda Public Security Bureau and ordered them to disarm.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>North China Turmoil</h3>
<p>After the signing of the Tanggu Agreement and the Dalian talks, the peaceful resolution of the Chahar issue followed. The situation in North China finally achieved temporary stability. The question remains: at what significant cost was this stability obtained? However, under helpless circumstances, being able to steal a moment of peace and live a peaceful life is indeed considered a fortunate outcome by the people of North China. However, less than a month after Feng Yuxiang left Chahar, the bandit forces in Luandong expanded greatly. The Beiping authorities sought the understanding of the Japanese side to suppress the bandit atmosphere, but on the 20th, Fang Zhenwu's army suddenly entered Huairou, followed by Ji Hongchang and others. Pingbei was again in a tense situation. On the 23rd, Japanese planes reappeared over Beiping. According to various news reports from the north, the bandits Lao Haozi and Guo Yazhou raised the banner of the East Asia Allied Joint Army and became active. Fang and Ji's armies plotted to survey the Pingjin area on five routes. It is said that they are all related to the Japanese. As a result, the turmoil has caused national panic. It is not only those in North China who are worried about the impending disaster.</p>
<p>Japan's current coveting of Pingjin is very similar to its coveting of Rehe last autumn, although the methods are different. However, the diplomatic gains it hopes for are even greater than the occupation of Pingjin. Therefore, the major changes in North China that people generally fear will not be realized as long as Japan's diplomatic hopes have not been cut off. Looking at today's telegrams, Shibayama has acknowledged that China's dispatch of security teams to Luandong for bandit suppression is permitted by the agreement, and even said that more can be sent. The Fang and Ji armies in the demilitarized zone have been forced to move south. Japanese planes have even bombed them to prevent them from going east and joining the Luandong bandit army. All of this is related to Japan's diplomatic activities. We cannot believe that the turmoil in North China can be eased by this, nor can we say that Japan's attitude is better than before. What we should pay attention to is the significant meaning behind this alternating tightening and loosening. The northern press is clear about this. Because they have personally suffered, as soon as the turmoil occurred, they demanded that "the authorities shoulder the heavy responsibility of the world with the demeanor of a national scholar, and openly and honestly interact with Japan to prevent the deterioration of the current situation." Their insight is extremely clear. If there were a way to prevent Japan from being the mastermind behind the scenes, then the mob of Lao Haozi and Guo Yazhou, and the isolated armies of Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang would not only be insufficient to harm North China, but even suppression and resolution would not be very difficult. However, a problem arises here: in order to prevent Japan from doing this, a considerable price must be paid. Can the authorities stabilize North China for the second time at a minimal price?</p>
<p>In short, the surface of this turmoil in North China is easy to resolve. The core of the problem lies entirely in diplomacy. If the authorities can know how to deal with it and seek a solution through diplomacy, and not use matters that cause national pain as the price of a diplomatic solution, then they will not fail the painstaking efforts of the North China public opinion circles.</p>
<h3>Regarding the False Detention of Russian Employees on the Chinese Eastern Railway, Russia Shows No Sign of Weakness Towards Japan</h3>
<p>Rudi Appoints Personnel to Fill Vacant Positions</p>
<p>The Japanese Puppet Authorities Are Greatly Embarrassed</p>
<p>The People of Harbin Are Anxiously Watching Russia's Next Move</p>
<p>(Harbin) Regarding the Russian employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway arrested by the puppet state, due to the puppet authorities' intention to escalate the incident, their release cannot be expected at present. Therefore, the Russian Director General has appointed Russian employees to act in their positions. The Russian side has stated that the Director General is determined not to concede. The puppet authorities were greatly embarrassed upon hearing this news and felt helpless. The Russian side is also very firm in dealing with the puppet Japanese governments. (Hualian Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the 24th, Li, the traitorous Superintendent of the Chinese Eastern Railway, proposed to Pander, the Russian Deputy Director General, to appoint successors to the detained cadres to fill their vacancies. Pander refused. On the 25th, Rudi, the Director General, declared that this action was a plot by the puppet state to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway. Therefore, the successors would not be appointed as people from the "puppet state." Subsequently, he immediately appointed Liu Weiyi as Acting Director of the Machinery Bureau, Gotev as Acting Director of the Finance and Tax Bureau, Shuogenov as Acting Factory Director, and Osdanlin as Acting Chief of the Dispatch Section, all of whom are Russian. The puppet state considers this a challenging act by Soviet Russia and is currently devising countermeasures. (Datong News Agency Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Today, the authorities of the puppet Manchukuo government issued an official gazette to the press, stating that Rudi, the General Manager of the Chinese Eastern Railway, has appointed four Soviet Russian employees to act in the positions of those recently detained. Li, the traitorous Puppet Director General Shao Geng, has appointed Bandura as Deputy Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway in place of Konizov. However, this approach is not in accordance with the regulations of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and Bandura is unwilling to accept the appointment, so the situation is extremely complicated. Personnel of "Manchukuo" have expressed resentment towards Rudi's appointment, and this matter has become the focus of their discussion. It is claimed that appointing special personnel to act in the positions of those detained, rather than allowing the detainees' assistants to act according to the law, is not legitimate and will only make the situation more complicated. According to the regulations of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the authority to make such appointments belongs to the council. The puppet authorities insist that the appointment of personnel must be approved by the council, and the number of Russian and puppet personnel should be equal; otherwise, no other personnel can be dispatched, and only the original assistants can act in their positions. Rudi and Bandura's violation of the Chinese Eastern Railway regulations proves that Soviet Russia has resolved to take active steps regarding the detention of the four Soviet Russian employees. Therefore, people from all walks of life in Harbin are watching Soviet Russia's second move. It is rumored that the Soviet Russian authorities ordered the recall of reserve pilots and mechanics for enlistment last week, so the situation is becoming increasingly uneasy. Merchants in Harbin are extremely panicked due to numerous rumors. (Reuters Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<h3>Rumors Spread Again That Soviet Russia Is Increasing Troops in the Far East</h3>

<h3>Hirota Urges Jiang's Envoy to Return to His Post and Jointly Seek a Breakthrough in the Current Sino-Japanese Situation</h3>
<p>Jiang Zuobin to Go to Tokyo at the Beginning of Next Month</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, according to semi-official announcements, when the new Foreign Minister Hirota took office, the Chinese envoy Jiang Zuobin sent him a congratulatory telegram. Hirota immediately replied with a telegram of thanks and requested Jiang to return to his post as soon as possible. He then asked the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires to convey this intention to Jiang. Jiang replied in a telegram that he would be able to return to his post from Shanghai at the beginning of next month. Due to the exchange of telegrams between the two, a rumor arose that Hirota would adopt an active policy towards China. This statement has been denied by the authorities, who stated that Hirota now wishes to enhance Sino-Japanese relations and regards China as a good neighbor. However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, Hirota has not yet formulated a concrete plan for China. (Reuters Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the beginning of his assumption of office, Foreign Minister Hirota met with Naval Minister Osumi and Army Minister Araki. Regarding the coordination of national defense issues and diplomatic relations, the result of their earnest talks was that the fundamental strategy of Japan's foreign policy was to take breaking through the situation with China as a prerequisite. From this perspective, they expressed to the National Government their hope that Ambassador Jiang Zuobin would resume his post. Jiang has replied that he will return to his post in early October. Foreign Minister Hirota will personally have earnest talks with Ambassador Jiang to jointly seek a breakthrough in the current state of Sino-Japanese relations. At a time when the National Government is expected to shift its diplomatic policy towards Japan after the Lushan Conference, the outcome of the meeting between Foreign Minister Hirota and Ambassador Jiang is highly noteworthy. (Datong Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota regards the adjustment of diplomatic relations with China as one of his major policies. He has instructed Ambassador Ariyoshi in China to repeatedly negotiate with the National Government to strive for the restoration of Sino-Japanese relations. The Foreign Minister felt particularly inconvenient due to Ambassador Jiang Zuobin's return to China, and there are many issues to be negotiated with Ambassador Jiang in the future. Therefore, on the 26th, he asked the Chargé d'Affaires Jiang Huaben to send a telegram to Jiang, urging him to return to his post as soon as possible. What instructions will Ambassador Jiang receive from the National Government upon returning to his post? Furthermore, it is noteworthy whether Foreign Minister Hirota will abandon his long-standing policy of passive observation and adopt an active policy. (Rengo Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the various problems arising from China's $50 million US dollar loan from the United States, including the sale of American cotton to Japan, the new Foreign Minister Hirota, from the perspective of promoting friendly Sino-Japanese relations, stated that if the National Government uses the funds obtained from the disposal of this American cotton loan not for resisting Japan, but solely for the revival of Chinese industry and domestic construction, it can promote China's improvement and development, which is truly beneficial to China itself. Therefore, within this scope, Japan is willing to provide active assistance to the disposal of American cotton. (Datong Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<h3>India-Japan Trade Treaty</h3>
<p>Britain Notifies Japan of a One-Month Extension</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government recently received a notification from the British government stating that it has decided to extend the cancellation period of the 1904 India-Japan Trade Treaty by one month. The British government had previously notified that the treaty would be canceled on October 10th, but now it has been extended to November 10th. After considering the British government's letter, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs instructed Matsudaira, the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, to suggest to the British government that the cancellation date of the trade treaty be extended until the conclusion of the Simla Trade Conference.

<h3>US State Department Notifies Britain That It Cannot Delay Warship Construction Plans</h3>
<p>Based on Increasing Naval Efficiency and Relieving Unemployment</p>
<p>And Firmly Believes the London Naval Treaty Is Fair and Impartial</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the US State Department formally notified Britain, stating that it cannot accept the suggestion to delay the current warship construction plans until after the conclusion of the disarmament conference. Britain, through Ambassador Davis, suggested to the US government that if cruisers of 10,000 tons with 6-inch guns are built, it may cause other countries to build warships of other classes. Could the construction of this type of new cruiser be delayed? It was also heard that Davis simultaneously reported to the government that European countries would like to see the US postpone the entire warship construction program. Today, the US government's response stated that even the suggestion to postpone only a part of the program is unacceptable to the United States. It is heard that the wording of the note is quite simple, based on the US President's determination to obtain an efficient navy and simultaneously relieve unemployment. The original text has not yet been published. It is also heard that Davis reported that Britain hopes to conclude a new agreement in 1935 to further reduce the maximum tonnage of each cruiser and battleship. Therefore, it wishes the US government to temporarily postpone construction. However, the US government will not cancel the contracts for ships that have already been contracted with shipyards for construction. The British government also recognizes that this response leaves no room for consultation and will stop here and no longer proceed. American people here believe that the nature of the US government's reply indicates that the United States firmly believes that the London Treaty is fair and impartial and does not need to be revised before its expiration. (National Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) US Navy personnel now hope to build two large airships in addition to building new ships and modernizing battleships, one to replace the Akron, which was lost in an accident, and one to replace the Los Angeles, which is nearly eight years old and will soon be unusable. According to the current plan, it is planned to first build a smaller one to replace the Los Angeles. Rear Admiral King, Director of Naval Aviation, has suggested to the Chief of Naval Operations that the design will utilize all past experiences to make it the most modern and perfect one. The hull will be made entirely of metal. The funding has not yet been estimated and will be allocated from the public works funds for relieving unemployment in the future.

<h3>The Little Entente Discusses Unified Military System</h3>
<p>Two Kings Attend the Meeting in Person</p>
<p>Romania's capital The Little Entente countries held their third meeting in Sinaia City today. The foreign ministers of the three countries discussed the Balkan issue, the most important of which is the situation created after the signing of the Greek-Turkish treaty, and the new hope for the Balkans given by the recent declaration of Turkish Prime Minister Ismet. The results of the recent travels of King Boris of Bulgaria in Paris and London are also being considered by the foreign ministers of the three countries. When the meeting discusses Central European issues tomorrow, it will be chaired by King Carol of Romania and King Alexander of Yugoslavia, which is unprecedented. (Havas Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>Romania's capital According to diplomatic circles, what was discussed at the meeting of the Little Entente countries yesterday was not only the political issues of the Balkan Peninsula, but also military issues containing some importance. As for today's meeting, King Carol of Romania and King Alexander of Yugoslavia attended in person, which is an unprecedented fact in the history of the Little Entente countries. From this, it can be seen that the talks of the Little Entente countries have exceeded the political scope. Although no one can say what the nature of these talks is, it is generally speculated that the issue of a unified military system must have been raised for discussion, and a military meeting may follow the current political meeting. In short, no detailed reports can be obtained on this level at present. The official communiqué only stated that "the ministers of the three Little Entente countries presented the results of the discussions of the Little Entente countries' meeting and the conclusions reached in the review of the international political situation to Their Majesties the Kings of Romania and Yugoslavia."

<h3>Roosevelt Goes to His Private Residence to Discuss Monetary Policy</h3>
<p>Consulting Extensively from All Sides</p>
<p>To Promote the Accelerated Recovery of All Industries</p>
<p>(Washington) US President Roosevelt left Washington this afternoon and will stay in New York for one night before going to his private residence in Hyde Park. He plans to have secret consultations with his most trusted advisors for a week. Official circles now believe that when the President returns to Beijing, he will be able to bring back a complete plan that will not only promote the recovery of all industries to the fastest possible extent, but also defeat the movement of the inflationist faction that has won over Congress. Before Roosevelt left Beijing, the inflationist faction declared that if the recovery plan cannot make greater progress in the next two months and restore the relationship between the gold standard and prices to at least that of 1925 and 1926, then Congress will pass a forced inflation bill. However, according to reliable sources, the US President is still determined not to use direct inflation methods, but will do his best to promote the recovery plan. He recently instructed key White House officials to submit proposals on how to enable the public to obtain more money to increase purchasing power. It is heard that not only those who were asked contributed opinions, but their friends also submitted more than 20 proposals, covering almost all aspects of monetary methods. The President believes that several of them are indeed sound measures and will give them careful consideration this time. (National News Agency Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<h3>Britain and Argentina Sign New Tariff Agreement</h3>
<p>Beneficial to Trade with Britain</p>
<p>Negotiations on US-Argentine Trade Agreement Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>National Telegraph, Buenos Aires, 26th Argentina and Britain have signed another new tariff agreement, which stipulates understandings on tariffs to promote trade. It was signed today by Argentine Foreign Minister Lemas and British Ambassador Chilton, with each signing the first letter of their names as a supplementary document to the British-Argentine trade agreement signed some time ago. The scope of the trade agreement is slightly restricted, but this supplementary document will record in detail the practical understandings of 388 types of goods produced in Britain and certain types of goods produced in Argentina, so that they can be easily promoted in the future. As for the negotiations between Argentina and the United States on a reciprocal agreement, they have been temporarily suspended because the main agricultural products of the two countries are mostly the same. Argentina wants to promote the sales of meat, leather, and grain, which American farmers cannot agree to due to conflicting interests. It is now expected that after the establishment of this new agreement, it will enable many British manufactured goods to sell well in Argentina.</p>
<h3>Araki Will Again Demand the Resignation of the Saito Cabinet</h3>
<p>The Military Advocates "Establishing National Policy"</p>
<p>The Cabinet's Attitude Is Said to Be Cold</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It has been a month since Army Minister Araki advocated the establishment of national policy in order to establish the guiding spirit and foothold of Japan in the future. However, Prime Minister Saito and the cabinet members' attitude is still lukewarm. Moreover, the compilation of the budget for the next year is imminent. The establishment of national policy and all facilities cannot be delayed any longer. From this perspective, the Army Minister plans to meet Prime Minister Saito again within days to urge the Prime Minister's decision, or even request a promise to implement it immediately. If the Prime Minister refuses the Army Minister's proposal, or even if he does not refuse, but buries it in ambiguity, what attitude will the Army Minister take? Although the Army Minister himself has not expressed anything, considering the general atmosphere among the middle-level officials in the Army Department, if the current cabinet disregards the Army Minister's urgent and appropriate proposal, or buries it in ambiguity, it not only shows that it is not qualified to deal with the extraordinary situation, but also may worsen the situation. At this time, the Army Minister should resolutely demand the resignation of the current cabinet. This is the unanimous opinion of the military. The Army Minister's attitude is very tough and clear. Depending on the results of the meeting with the Prime Minister, it will lead to a major change in the political situation. It is highly noteworthy what attitude the Prime Minister will take during the meeting. (Datong Telegraph, 27th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The National Economic Commission is currently preparing a plan to control the economy to suit China's situation. After Rashiman comes to China for discussion, it will selectively announce it to the whole country, so that the people can fully understand the national construction and serve as a backing for the government. In addition, the organizational regulations of the specialized committees under the Commission have been drafted and are in place. Each committee will probably have three standing members and one secretary. The date of establishment of the Economic Commission must wait until Song Ziwen returns to Beijing and meets with President Wang and Sun Ke before it can be decided. The Commission will expand the funding for undertakings and strive to reduce office expenses. After the original preparatory office is changed to a secretariat, the staff who are not related to the undertakings will be reduced to save public funds. (Central News Agency Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<h3>Tang Youren Discusses Diplomatic Relations in North China</h3>
<p>Fang Ji and the Japanese Side Do Not Seem to Have Any Collusion</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Vice-Minister Tang Youren said that after the troops of Fang Ji entered the Huairou area north of Ping, the situation in North China seemed to be tense. In fact, the strength of the Fang Ji troops is weak and not worth worrying about, but because Fang entered the area where troops are not stationed, it gives the Japanese side an excuse, and also creates many obstacles to the restoration of order in the area. The central government is paying close attention to this matter and has instructed the Beiping Military Council, together with the local authorities, to seek a peaceful solution as soon as possible, and will never allow the situation to escalate and affect the security of North China. In the military aspect, only slight defensive preparations are currently being made to prevent bandits from taking the opportunity to flee around and devastate the local area. Whether or not to send troops to suppress them in the future will depend on the future situation. As for the rumor that the Japanese side will use Fang Ji to create a serious situation in order to induce our country to conduct political negotiations with them, according to my observation, Fang Ji and the Japanese side do not seem to have any collusion. It seems unbelievable that the Japanese side will use this opportunity, because the Japanese side had many opportunities to use before the Fang Ji troops left Chahar. Moreover, the Japanese side has issued a warning to Fang Ji, ordering them to leave the territory, which is enough to prove the untruth of the rumors. I believe that if the two troops have no background, the remaining people can be resolved recently. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>The Inner Mongolia Autonomy Issue</h3>
<p>Decision to Send Huang Shaoxiong to Zhangjiakou</p>
<p>Summoning Princes and Nobles of Various Leagues and Banners for Consultation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In response to the declarations of local autonomy by the Xilin Gol League, Yikezhao League, and Ulanqab League of Inner Mongolia, Wang Jingwei of the Executive Yuan has been consulting with Mongolian compatriots from these leagues residing in Beijing for several days, inquiring in detail. He has also been in constant communication with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek via telegram. A general plan has now been agreed upon, and it has been decided to send Minister of Interior Huang Shaoxiong to Zhangjiakou to meet with the chairmen of the governments of both Chahar and Suiyuan provinces. Together, they will summon the princes and nobles of the various leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia for sincere consultation, providing guidance based on the circumstances, and preparing for local autonomy in Inner Mongolia. They will also sincerely advise the Mongolian princes and nobles not to sever their connection with the central government. Premier Wang is currently consulting with Huang Shaoxiong regarding the date of his trip to Mongolia and all necessary preparations beforehand. Once a decision has been made, another meeting will be held with Mongolian personnel residing in Beijing. Furthermore, it has been learned that the Mongolian compatriots in Beijing believe that the central government's decision to send Minister of Interior Huang Shaoxiong to Inner Mongolia is appropriate. However, in order to connect with the Mongolian princes and nobles and assist Minister Huang in planning and implementing the project, it is essential to send a respected Mongolian figure along as well. The government is currently seeking Bai Yunti's consent to join the mission. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the declaration of autonomy by the various leagues and banners of Western Mongolia, the Ministry of Interior believes that local autonomy falls under its jurisdiction. It has telegraphed the governments of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces to conduct on-the-spot investigations to ascertain the truth and report to the ministry for verification. Furthermore, it intends to submit its opinions to the central government. The ministry believes that when Chahar and Suiyuan were provinces, there were no significant changes to the Mongolian league and banner system, and the old system was maintained. If the Mongolians believe that their system is no longer suitable for the current environment, the central government should make every effort to improve it within the realm of possibility and provide guidance and assistance. Otherwise, the Mongolian region is crucial for border defense, and it would be inappropriate to allow them to change it freely. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Xiong Sui Discusses the Situation of Public Monopoly of Oil and Salt</h3>
<p>The Purpose Is to Cut Off Supplies to the Communist Areas</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Xiong Sui, Director of the Executive Headquarters' Food Salt and Kerosene Administration, discussed the public monopoly situation, saying that the public monopoly of food salt and kerosene is part of an economic blockade, the purpose of which is to cut off supplies to the Communist areas and is different from general salt administration. (1) The nature of the public monopoly adopts the model of government supervision and commercial management. Public monopoly committees and sub-committees are established in each county. Based on the quantity of food salt and kerosene required by the entire county or district, salt and oil merchants are recruited to raise funds for buying and selling, supervising their income and expenditures, and restricting the quantity of sales. (2) The public monopoly organization, the county public monopoly committee, is jointly organized by personnel sent by the county government, county chamber of commerce, and other public legal entities. Public monopoly committees are set up in districts and important towns, organized by district offices and directors or chiefs of joint guarantee from important town chambers of commerce. (3) Public monopoly methods. The county committee purchases oil and salt and issues merchants with passports formulated by the administration, which are used for procurement. Sub-committees purchase by applying to the district office for a purchase permit and procuring from the county public monopoly committee. People purchase using purchase vouchers formulated by the county government and purchasing from the sub-committees. These vouchers are distributed to the people without charge. The quantity of food salt is limited to four to five qian per person per day, and kerosene is calculated by household. Households with ten or more people are considered upper households, and each household must not buy more than half a jin per day. Households with five or more people are considered middle households, and each household must not buy more than four liang per day. Households with less than five people are considered lower households, and each household must not buy more than two liang per day. As for stores and factories, which consume more, they can purchase double the amount of their classification. (4) The effect of the public monopoly. According to reports intercepted from the Communist areas, it is known that since the implementation of the economic blockade, the Communist areas have an extreme lack of materials, especially kerosene and food salt, which the Communist areas do not have. Furthermore, these are things that people cannot live without for a day. If our army's blockade is tight, we will surely be able to defeat the Communists. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Five Ministries to Confer on the Issue of Taxing Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of levying import duties on foreign rice, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance stated that the volume of foreign rice imports has been increasing in recent years, while the output of domestic rice is sometimes insufficient. This contradictory phenomenon is rare in other countries. It is not due to a lack of overall statistics (apart from the customs office's import and export statistics), but rather because there has never been a detailed survey of domestic grain production and demand. As a result, one province may have an abundance of grain, while another province has nowhere to purchase it. Therefore, the ministry convened a grain conference in the first half of the year. At that time, representatives from various provinces had divergent opinions on levying taxes on foreign rice, with some in favor and others opposed. It was subsequently decided to first establish free circulation and transportation and eliminate various domestic rice taxes and levies before implementing a tax on foreign rice. The Executive Yuan has now scheduled a meeting of the five ministries of Finance, Industry, Interior, Communications, and Railways within the next few days to discuss the steps for levying import duties on foreign rice. The main points of discussion will be based on the resolutions of the National Grain Conference: (1) To what extent should the price of domestic rice fall before a tax should be levied on foreign rice imports, and how much should be taxed per dan? (2) To what extent should the price of domestic rice rise before the tax on foreign rice should be abolished, allowing foreign rice to be imported in large quantities to prevent panic over domestic food shortages? (3) When there is a domestic bumper harvest and sufficient domestic rice, how should the import of foreign rice be restricted? A standard will be determined for the above three points to facilitate gradual implementation. The date of the meeting has not yet been determined. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Monks Turn Red</h3>
<p>Propagating Anti-Religious Ideas</p>
<p>Wakayama Communist Case Sentenced</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 27th A monk was arrested by the Nishikanda Police Station in Kanda District, Tokyo this month, 19th, and has been questioned extensively for several days. It is reported that the monk has been infected with communist ideas, propagandizes communism to believers, and has composed new Buddhist scriptures, reciting anti-religious scriptures morning and evening. It is said that the monk's name is Akisama Jun’ei, who has served as a temple monk in Asakusa Honganji Temple, Koishikawa Honpōji Temple, and Kokuryū Temple. Since Showa 4 (1929), he felt deeply about the corruption of the religious community and participated in the Anti-Religious Research Association, becoming a red monk and propagating anti-religious ideas. The scriptures he recited say, "Temple monks are thieves of the Dharma for chanting sutras; they want money for death, they want money for burial." Since cracking this case, the Japanese police have intensified their vigilance over monks nationwide.</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 27th According to the Public Security Bureau Gazette of the Ministry of Interior, since the crackdown on the Wakayama Re-establishment Communist Party case in November Showa 6 (1931) and the arrest of its chairman, Tanaka Kiyoharu, it was hoped that the communist elements in the county would disappear. In fact, they only temporarily ceased their activities. Before long, the communist elements in the area became active again. By March 26 of this year, their activities had spread throughout the county. The Wakayama Prefectural Police Department dispatched a police force to arrest a large number of communists, arresting 107 people. After half a year of interrogation, it was decided that 12 people were guilty and prosecuted, 42 were held for prosecution, and 53 were released.</p>

<h3>Russia Expels German Reporter</h3>
<p>German Request to Revoke Order Denied</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 26th According to an official statement, the reason why Soviet Russia expelled German news reporters in Russia was because Soviet Russian news reporters in Germany were subjected to arrest, inspection and all kinds of harsh treatment by the authorities, and were eventually barred from attending the Leipzig trial, while representatives of other newspaper offices were not excluded. This behavior of the German government makes it impossible for Soviet Russia to work in Germany. German Ambassador Nadolny asked the Soviet Russian government to revoke the order to expel German reporters, but Foreign Commissar Litvinov refused, saying that expulsion was better than retaliating against Germany by other means for its orderly behavior of mistreating Soviet reporters.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 26th Berlin expressed deep sorrow over the Soviet Russian government's abrupt method of recalling all Soviet Russian newspaper reporters stationed in Germany, and feared that the friendship between the two countries would suffer significant damage. The reason for this incident was that two Soviet Russian news reporters stationed in Germany wanted to participate in the trial of the German Reichstag fire case in Leipzig. The legal authorities had signed two admission tickets for them, but for some reason they did not obtain the admission tickets and went directly to Leipzig. The Leipzig authorities, considering the actions of the two suspicious, arrested them at their residence. However, after a brief interrogation, they were released. Upon receiving this news, the Soviet Russian government immediately notified the German government, stating that all reporters of Soviet Russian newspapers in Germany would be recalled within three days, and that all German reporters in Russia should also leave the country within three days. German officials believe that Russia's expulsion of German reporters is unjustified, as the arrest of the two Soviet Russian reporters was due to their own negligence, and that the Soviet Russian government acted abruptly without waiting for a formal investigation, which is regrettable. Since the incident occurred, the German government immediately expressed its apologies. However, there is still hope that Soviet Russia will revoke the order, as Germany values its friendship with Soviet Russia at all times.</p>
<h3>After Hurricane, Great Flood Follows, Situation in Mexico Extremely Dire</h3>
<p>Hurricane's Ferocity Unseen in Forty Years</p>
<p>Tampico Completely Destroyed, Thousands Homeless</p>
<p>Aircraft Engaging in Rescue Operations</p>
<p>President Appeals to Countries Around the World</p>
<p>Mexico City According to Interior Minister Vasconcelos, the hurricane was the most severe in the past forty years. The Mexican president has now issued an appeal, requesting assistance from countries around the world. All parties are now engaged in rescue operations. Thousands of people in the Tampico disaster area have lost their homes, and property losses are extremely heavy. Two trains loaded with soldiers have rushed to the disaster area to engage in repair work, while transporting food and medicine for relief. Tampico has now declared martial law, and everything is under the control of the military authorities. Military aircraft have already flown to the area, where the water is up to fourteen feet deep. Three-quarters of the city has been destroyed, and brick and wooden houses have been completely destroyed. The wind speed appears to be one hundred and fifty miles per hour, so the ground buildings in Tampico were all destroyed. The wind was strongest in the first two days of the storm. All transportation to and from Tampico has been destroyed. Currently, only aircraft and ships anchored at the seaport can communicate by radio. Two passenger and freight trains heading to Tampico have completely disappeared. At the same time, the Tamesi River and the Pánuco River have flooded, drowning many people and causing a flood. It is now feared that the disaster area will extend to Tospan, 150 miles from Tampico. Currently, the losses to the national railways have reached one million yuan. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, a center of oil refining, suffered extremely heavy losses in the hurricane.

Several aircraft are now dropping food from the air. The American Red Cross has recently donated 25,000 yuan to help the victims. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Political Turmoil Brewing in Southern Ireland</h3>
<p>De Valera's Response Proves Tricky</p>
<p>Labor Support Limited</p>
<p>Republicans Clash with Police</p>
<p>Reuters, Dublin, 26th The turmoil brewing in the Irish Free State seems likely to erupt when Parliament meets tomorrow. De Valera must now fight on two fronts, as he must deal with the organized Irish United Party, while the Irish Republican Army, which usually supports De Valera, has been frequently engaging in violence, giving his opponents ammunition. His actions are thus quite hampered. De Valera easily obtained labor support at the expense of the practical Labourites, but his influence is limited. The labor sector is currently very dissatisfied with De Valera's unemployment relief plan, and fundamentally opposes the revival of the Public Security Act.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Dublin, 27th Clashes occurred in various places here last night, seriously injuring fifteen people, all of whom were taken to the hospital. About thirty people were slightly injured. The disaster was caused by several people claiming to be Republicans who attempted to rob a British brewery. The police were later forced to use batons to disperse the crowd, and order was restored. It is rumored that the authorities have ordered the arrest of General O'Duffy as a result, but this has not yet been confirmed.</p>

The disaster situation in Yugoslavia has not yet been fully understood. After the earthquake, the area was hit by heavy rains, causing flooding in low-lying areas, which has not yet receded.

<h3>Fang Zhenwu's Troops Advance to Gaoliying</h3>
<p>Immediately Make Contact with the Garrison Troops Stationed in Gaoliying</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Fang's Troops as a Show of Force</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Shackles of the Tanggu Truce</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping: After Fang Ji and other troops arrived in Huairou, there were reports of a plan to advance towards Beiping and Tianjin. This morning (26th), Fang's troops advanced from Niulanshan in two directions: one eastward towards the area of Sanhe and Erhe, attempting to cut off the Beiping-Tianjin communication line, and the other southward directly towards Gaoliying. Details of the situation from various sources are reported as follows:</p>
<p>After Ji Hongchang, Zhan Tao, Rong Sandian and others reached Huairou, Fang immediately convened a military conference and decided to break out of the war zone in three directions, aiming to seize Beiping and Tianjin. Fang took the frontal position, advancing southward from Niulanshan to attack Beiping. Ji took the left flank, passing through Sanhe and Xianghe to break through the Beiping-Tianjin line. Tang Yulin took the right flank, aiming to enter Nankou. However, the Japanese army demanded that Fang Ji and other troops withdraw from the war zone today. Therefore, Fang Ji and other military plans were very active. Mr. Fang himself went to Niulanshan yesterday to command. At 2:00 AM this morning (26th), his southward-bound troops directly attacked Gaoliyingzi. The Beiping authorities had taken precautions early on. Gaoliyingzi is about sixty li from Beiping and is a crucial strategic point in northern Beiping, bordering the war zone. It was originally the defense area of the 23rd Army, garrisoned by Zhao Xizeng's company. The garrison was changed yesterday. Zhao's company was transferred elsewhere, and Zhao Jingmin's regiment from Wan Fulin's troops was transferred to fill the defense. Zhao's company was ordered to depart yesterday morning, but Zhao's regiment was delayed until 10:30 last night due to heavy rain and muddy roads before the vanguard arrived. Fang Zhenwu had sent scouts to Gaoliying in advance to investigate, and learned that the garrison troops had withdrawn and the relief troops had not yet arrived. Therefore, around 4:00 AM this morning (26th), he sent a cavalry unit to attack. At that time, Li's battalion of Zhao's regiment had just arrived and completed the relief. They immediately sent a team to meet the enemy, and a conflict occurred. Fang's cavalry, numbering about 600, acted swiftly and broke into the Gaoli Market Street through Xiaoying Village. Fang's troops occupied the north of the market, and Zhao's regiment defended the south street. There was fierce street fighting on both sides, and both sides received reinforcements to fight. The stalemate continued throughout the day and into the night, and there was still contact. While the two armies were in a stalemate, four Japanese aircraft suddenly flew to the sky above Gaoli at 12:30 PM, making low-altitude flights, circling and reconnoitering, and dropping two bombs that landed in the city, all of which exploded. The sound was heard for more than ten li, and the damage is unknown. Fang Zhenwu arrived at the North Shibanqiao in Gaoliying from Niulanshan this afternoon to command, and most of the troops were concentrated in the Qiaozicun Shibanqiao area. Ji Hongchang's troops also moved south from Huairou this morning. The situation on the front line is gradually becoming tense.</p>
<p>After Fang's troops entered Huairou, the Beiping authorities immediately sent Yin Tong to negotiate with the Japanese, and put forward three reasons, asking the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, ​​Chai Shan, to telegraph to Tokyo and the Kwantung Army authorities. However, the Kwantung Army adopted a firm attitude, and sent four aircraft to Beiping this afternoon to distribute absurd leaflets. At 2:00 PM, Chai Shan returned to the Jurentang to meet with He Yingqin and talked for more than forty minutes. Chai Shan said that he had received a reply telegram, stating that the Japanese army had not colluded with Fang Ji's troops and decided to drive Fang Ji's troops out of the war zone from the 27th, and to accommodate the opinions of the Beiping authorities to stop Fang Ji and other troops from advancing eastward. The planes sent to the area east of Niulanshan in Huairou were to monitor Fang Ji and other troops. As for Luandong, bandit troops attacked Funing. Chai Shan claimed that some bandit troops might be impersonating Japanese soldiers and causing disturbances. In the future, if the Chinese security forces encounter bandits impersonating Japanese soldiers, they can freely suppress them, and the Japanese side has no objection. Although He was dissatisfied with this statement from the Japanese side, he would determine his policy based on the urgency of the situation and how it develops.</p>
<p>He Yingqin expressed his opinions in writing on how to deal with Fang Ji's affairs: (1) Chai Shan came to see me the other day and asked me to convey to the Kwantung Army the opinion that the Kwantung Army had replied by telegram that it fully understood. However, because Fang's troops are still holding up the anti-Japanese banner, if they do not withdraw from the demilitarized zone within the time limit, the Kwantung Army will still suppress them. However, our side believes that Huairou is Chinese territory, and we cannot accept this approach. We still ask them to convey that the future will be handled by our side. (2) If Fang's army disturbs Beiping and Tianjin to the south, the authorities will naturally resolve it. (3) After the Funing County magistrate was driven out by the Japanese, the Luandong bandit suppression affairs will be negotiated with the Japanese by the war zone reception committee and the provincial government.</p>
<p>Four Japanese aircraft flew from the north at 12:20 PM this afternoon, passing through Andingmen, along Dongsi Pailou to the Japanese barracks in Dongjiaominxiang, dropping a communication cylinder, and then flying from Dongjiaominxiang to Zhongnanhai, scattering many five-colored leaflets. The wording was extremely absurd, declaring that the Japanese side was determined to automatically drive out Fang Zhenwu's troops, with the intention of taking pleasure in others' misfortunes. The Japanese aircraft circled in the city of Beiping for more than ten minutes before flying north. The original text of the leaflet is recorded as follows: "A Letter to Chinese Military Authorities, Officials, and the People: We have heard that a Chinese person, Fang Zhenwu, has recently harbored ulterior motives and led a large army into the truce agreement area where the Chinese army is not allowed to enter, and inflicted suffering on the local people. Although the commander of our Great Japanese Army will not interfere in the internal strife of the Chinese people, our army respects the truce agreement from a position of brightness and justice and now demands the withdrawal of Fang's army from the area where the Chinese army is not allowed to enter. If they refuse to withdraw at that time, our army will resolutely suppress them and is now determined and prepared. It is our deep belief that Fang Zhenwu intends to resist the National Government, and the Chinese army also intends to suppress his behavior. Because the area entered by Fang's army belongs to the area north of the truce agreement line, our Great Japanese Army is willing to take the trouble to drive them out. Our approach is entirely to respect the truce agreement and there is no other intention. We hereby solemnly declare that once our army and Fang's army engage in battle, the local people will naturally suffer considerable damage. The commander of our army is heartbroken and extremely distressed when he thinks of this. If local officials and the people unite and drive Fang Zhenwu out of the area south of the truce agreement line, it would be extremely fortunate. Because a small number of troops of our unit are stationed in Miyun County, that place can be spared this disaster, which is particularly commendable. You must know the speed of our army's combat preparations. Because of the transportation by a large number of vehicles, everything can be completed immediately. We are afraid that you are not aware of this. Please be aware. September 25, Showa 8, Commander of the Great Japanese Army."</p>
<p>Military attaché Chai Shan of the Japanese Embassy said this morning that the Kwantung Army warned Fang Zhenwu to withdraw south of the war zone within five days from the 22nd. Although part of Fang's troops has now withdrawn to Niulanshan, Niulanshan is also a demilitarized zone, and the Kwantung Army will still use force to suppress them according to the warning letter. Regarding the fact that the war zone is Chinese territory and there are unstable phenomena within the area, the Chinese army should resolve it by itself, without the need for the Kwantung Army to send troops. The Kwantung Army has also considered this, but since the agreement was established, the Chinese side has not actively carried out security within the war zone. Although various methods have been used, such as recruiting bandit troops and sending security forces, they have all been ineffective and banditry continues. Moreover, the security forces have not been fully dispatched to date. Now they are asking to send troops, and the Kwantung Army believes that the time has not come, so it intends to deal with it alone. I met with Minister He the night before last to discuss the handling of Fang Ji's troops, which is inconvenient to disclose. The Kwantung Army sent Colonel Yoshida to Miyun. Although I know about it, I do not know the details of the meeting with Fang Ji. The Fang Ji issue will not be expanded, but if Fang's troops flee to the Luandong area, it will be more difficult to deal with. Recently, Japanese troops have been continuously transported to Beiping for rotation and return to their units, which has no other purpose. (September 26)</p>
<h3>Chen Jiongming Passes Away</h3>
<p>Ma Yuhang and Others Talk About Chen's Dying Condition</p>
<p>And Detail Chen's Political Thoughts in His Later Years</p>
<p>Chen Was Thrifty and Hardworking, His Funeral Was Extremely Austere</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Chen Jiongming, former Commander-in-Chief of the Guangdong Army, passed away on the 22nd at his residence at 27 Yuxiu Street, Happy Valley, Hong Kong. The funeral home is located downstairs at No. 25, and is presided over by Chen's confidants Ma Yuhang, Zhong Xiunan, Zhong Jingtang and others. According to Ma and others, the process of Mr. Chen's death is as follows:</p>
<p>Ma Yuhang and others said: "Since Mr. Chen retired from public life, he has lived in Hong Kong. He occasionally went out, but returned soon. In recent years, he has been engaged in writing. In addition to his book 'A Humble Proposal for Chinese Unification', he also has works on legal systems and production. Since the national crisis, Mr. Chen has been sad all day long. He once said to his colleagues that China would have no way to preserve itself five years after Japan occupied the eastern provinces. I am old and may be spared the pain of national subjugation, but you will not be able to avoid this disaster. The reasons for Mr. Chen's illness were partly due to his hard work in writing and partly due to his feeling of national injury. His family was poor and had no food for the next day, and his life was extremely difficult. This was the immediate cause of his illness. At the end of August this year, he occasionally felt chills and fever, but he didn't take it seriously. Mr. Chen had studied Chinese medical books and prescribed his own treatment. After ten days, the fever had not subsided. He asked his trusted Western doctor to treat him. At this time, he suspected that he had enteritis. He asked a professor of medicine at the University of Hong Kong to examine him and determined that there were bacilli in his blood and concluded that it was enteritis. Mr. Chen then left his home and went to the Mattao Hospital for treatment. After spending fifteen or sixteen days in Mattao Hospital, his condition improved day by day, the fever had subsided completely, and his spirits gradually recovered. The doctor advised Mr. Chen to eat thin porridge and said that he could be discharged from the hospital soon. Mr. Chen's health gradually recovered, and he received visitors and talked about national affairs. One day, a military and political figure came from another port, and Mr. Chen talked with him, and his interest was particularly strong. Although his colleagues knew that it was not suitable for a newly recovered patient, there was no way to prevent it. Unexpectedly, around the 10th of this month, Mr. Chen felt a little uneasy, and it gradually became more serious. The doctor diagnosed that the enteritis had relapsed, and immediately performed a blood transfusion. There was a slight turning point. On the 18th and 19th, he suddenly fell into a coma. At that time, there was still a glimmer of hope, and Mr. Chen also asked to change to a Chinese doctor, so he moved back to his residence. His illness was beyond saving. Around 12:00 PM on the 22nd, Mr. Chen suddenly woke up from his sleep, as if he wanted to tell his colleagues his condition. His colleagues knew that he was near death, and asked his family to ask about family matters first. Mr. Chen gave a half-bitter smile and said to his daughter, 'There is nothing to say about my family affairs.' After the daughter stepped back, his colleagues asked him about his views on national affairs. Mr. Chen suddenly became excited and wanted to wave his hand to ask his colleagues for pen and ink, but his hand was already stiff. He opened his mouth and called out 'Republic' 'Republic' to his colleagues. His voice was very clear, but the words after 'Republic' were blurred and indistinguishable. Presumably, he was supporting the Republic and encouraging us to work hard. As for Mr. Chen's views on national affairs, he believed that the country must be truly unified before all construction can be gradually promoted. He also believed that the chaos in the country was not caused by the people, but by the army's failure to fulfill its responsibilities and its position in national defense, and its reckless interference in politics. Under the rule of the military, the country has no constitution that is believed in and abided by by the people from top to bottom. There is only military rule and only rule by man. The country is in great chaos. As for the specific methods of cleaning up the situation, they have been detailed in his 'A Humble Proposal for Chinese Unification', which can be ignored here. His political thoughts in his later years tended towards socialism, believing that China should build a 'New Socialist State'."</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Chen's family situation, Ma and others said that Mr. Chen never engaged in industry. Thrift and hard work were his rules for self-preservation and his family instructions to his children. After his retirement, he first rented a house in Hong Kong. Later, his family became increasingly impoverished, and he shared his brother's residence. Now, after his death, there are no possessions other than a large pile of books. Mr. Chen was 57 years old and left behind an old mother, a wife, five daughters, and three sons. His wife, Ms. Huang, is an old-fashioned woman from the countryside. Although Mr. Chen was once a powerful man, he never took a concubine. The eldest son, Dingxia, is 17 years old and is studying at the Affiliated Middle School of Datong University in Shanghai. He was telegraphed to return to Hong Kong immediately. The second son, Dingyan, is 11 years old, and the third son, Dingbing, is 9 years old, both studying at the Lingnan Branch School in Hong Kong. There are five daughters, the eldest daughter (34 years old this year), and the third and fourth daughters are all married. The eldest daughter, Baoyao, the second daughter, Biyao, the third daughter, Ruiyao, the fourth daughter, Shuyao, and the fifth daughter, Meiyao. The second and fifth daughters are still studying at St. Stephen's Girls' College. All the daughters are the eldest. Mr. Chen also has an 83-year-old mother, Ms. Yang, who is still alive and well.</p>
<p>Ma and others also said that after Mr. Chen sent a telegram to retire from public life, he still formed a party to fight the Communists, which exhausted his mental and physical strength. He once went to Tianjin last year, but returned to Hong Kong shortly after. There are rumors outside that he colluded with the violent forces. I don't know Mr. Chen's life deeds. Whether they were merits or crimes, later historical records should have a fair judgment. However, his heart of not harming the country and not selling the country has not lagged behind future generations. (September 23)</p>
<h3>Second Military Supplies Conference</h3>
<p>—Held in Nanchang—</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The National Military Supplies Conference was held once in Nanjing. The second was held in Nanchang on the 25th of this month. In recent days, all independent brigade commanders and above, as well as directors of management offices, directors of military supplies offices, or section chiefs, have arrived in the province to report. Yu Feipeng, the Director-General of Military Supplies, also rushed to Nanchang on the 23rd to ask Chairman Chiang for instructions on everything. The conference received many proposals. The opening ceremony was held at 8:00 AM on the 25th at the Management Office of the Nanchang Camp in Sanyan Well, chaired by Xiong Shihui, Director of the Management Office of the Camp. Xiong delivered the opening speech, the general idea of ​​which was that in this time of serious national crisis and financial difficulties, military supplies personnel should be fair, honest, and dedicated to their duties so as not to disappoint the country and compatriots. Therefore, the management should plan carefully so that all uses can meet the budget, without shortages or excesses. The main purpose of convening this conference is to achieve absolute openness in military supplies, and all military divisions and departments should receive military supplies and weapons according to the budget calculation table, with equal distribution and uniform treatment, to eliminate all malpractices such as favoritism, extravagance, and embezzlement. As for the reorganization of the management and military supplies of various departments, the standardization of budget and final accounts, and all improvement measures, we hope that everyone will express their opinions. Then the discussion of the proposals began, including the procedures for determining the budget plan, compiling the budget book and attached tables, compiling the budget plan for various types of teachers, reporting the expenses of various transportation offices, and consolidating and unifying bookkeeping tables. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon, and continued in the afternoon. The proposals will be classified and reviewed, and then submitted to the General Assembly for approval. The meeting is expected to last for three to five days, until the proposals are discussed and concluded. According to another military source, only representatives from the bandit suppression troops participated in this military supplies conference. (September 25)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Telegraphs Request to Abolish the Perpetual Tenancy Deed Tax</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government issued an order to implement the collection of the Perpetual Tenancy Deed Tax at five jiao per mu. The public groups of various counties believe that this is an excessive tax, which is contrary to the purpose of maintaining farmers and reviving rural areas. Xu Shiqi and Wu Juchi, citizens of this county, once telegraphed an appeal on behalf of the people. It is now learned that Li Zuhua, director of the Property Management Office of this county, telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Provincial Government, and the County Magistrate on different dates, stating that he has recently learned that the Jiangsu Provincial Government is about to implement the Perpetual Tenancy Deed Tax at five jiao per mu, and the county has been ordered to comply. The common people were alarmed upon hearing the news. At this time, the rural areas are bankrupt, all industries are in recession, and people's lives are difficult, and all kinds of situations have become depressed. The government loves the people like children and should urgently relieve their suffering and provide relief. Now, it is instead imposing heavy taxes and disregarding the lives of the people. Is it that people's livelihood is insufficient, and the country's use alone can be sufficient? If this plan is implemented, it will undoubtedly put the exhausted people to death. The common people are heartbroken and cannot sleep peacefully. Zuhua and others have witnessed the situation and cannot remain silent. Therefore, they specially telegraph and earnestly ask you to consider the suffering of the people's livelihood, abolish the plan, and never advocate it, so as to relieve the people of Jiangsu.</p>
<h3>Suzhou's False Name Fraud Exposed</h3>
<p>Li Genyuan, a person from Yunnan, once served as the Prime Minister when Li Yuanhong was in power. After retiring with Li, he lived in Shiquan Street in Suzhou, writing poetry and visiting ancient sites, and did not ask about current affairs. However, Li's students and old friends were all over the world, which led to a person in Shanghai who claimed to be Cai Songpo's son, Cai Zhiyao, forging Li's letter of introduction and visiting Sun Ke, Kong Xiangxi, and Wu Tiecheng to defraud them of money. After Kong telegraphed to inquire about Li, the conspiracy was exposed. The telegram from Kong and the letters from Li to various important people are recorded below to show the full picture of the case. Telegram from Kong Xiangxi: (1) To Mr. Li Yinquan: Recently, Cai Zhiyao, the son of Mr. Cai Songpo, came to see me with your letter. Is there such a thing? Please reply by telegram immediately. (2) I have received your letter and the three original letters. I understand one thing. Yesterday, the person claiming to be Cai Songpo's son came to visit me with your letter. At that time, I suspected that he was a fraud, so I telegraphed to inquire. After reading your reply, I learned that Brother Tiecheng had been defrauded of fifty yuan. This person forged seals and has been discovered again and again. As you said, it is appropriate to hand him over to the police for punishment. However, I asked him to come again, but he has not come, presumably because he has fled out of fear. (3) Your reply is understood. Cai Zhiyao came to visit me recently, and I detained him and handed him over for interrogation. Regarding the part about forging your seal and letters, please send a letter to Brother Tiecheng to handle it. Reply to Kong Yongzhi: To Mr. Yongzhi: I have received your telegram and learned that Cai Zhiyao, who claimed to be Cai Songpo's son, has been detained and handed over for interrogation, which is gratifying. Regarding the forging of seals and letters, I have sent another letter to Brother Tiecheng to check. Reply to Sun Zhesheng: It has been a long time since I heard from you. I have received your letter and understand one thing. However, Cai Songpo's son is currently in Yunnan. The person who went to your office for help this time is a fraud. The letter of introduction he held is also forged. Brother Tiecheng and Yongzhi were deceived by him a few days ago. I will reply to them and ask them to hand him over to the police for punishment, which is very hateful and also laughable. I have returned the 100 yuan that you sent to the Bank of China. Please check and reply. Letter to Wu Tiecheng: I received your letter earlier. Mr. Kong Yongzhi telegraphed and said that someone claiming to be Cai Songpo's son came to you with my letter for help. I don't know if there is such a thing. I replied that I did not write a letter of introduction. I think he and the person who defrauded me are the same person. I hope you will arrest him and hand him over for punishment. I recently received a telegram from Mr. Yongzhi, saying that he has been detained and handed over to you for handling. He instructed me to send you the part about forging seals and letters. I have sent the forged items to Mr. Yongzhi, and I think Mr. Yongzhi has transferred them to you as well. I have not kept anything else. Please check and punish him according to the law.</p>
<h3>Wuxi's Three Notorious Robbers Sentenced Separately</h3>
<p>Dai Shouquan and other detectives of the Detective Team of the County Public Security Bureau of this county led the detectives to the Renhe Hotel in Suzhou on May 23, disguising themselves to arrest Gu Agen, Wang Heshang, Zhang Achao, and suspect Yu Gouda, four notorious robbers who robbed the home of Tao Bozhi in Xiupu Township and a certain surname Yang's home in Yangshuyuan in this county. After interrogating them after escorting them to Wuxi, they were temporarily detained pending trial. Two soldiers, Zhang Lansheng and Fan Arong, were assigned to guard them. Unexpectedly, Gu Agen suddenly broke his shackles and escaped the next morning. Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau sent Wang Heshang and the other three prisoners, along with the two soldiers, to the County Court for interrogation and detention. Later, Detective Dai arrested Gu again on Wuzhen Road in Shanghai and sent him to the court. The Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution together. Yesterday, Judge Lai Sihong of the Criminal Court concluded the trial and sentenced Gu Agen to sixteen years in prison, Wang Heshang and Zhang Achao to fourteen years in prison each, Yu Gouda was acquitted, and guards Zhang Lansheng and Fan Arong were sentenced to four months in prison each.</p>
<h3>Transfer of New and Old Prison Officials</h3>
<p>Han Minwen, a prison official in this county, was ordered to be transferred to the Zhenjiang prison official position. Kong Xianglin was transferred to Wuxi to fill the vacancy. Mr. Kong came to Wuxi a few days ago to discuss the handover matters with the predecessor. Mr. Kong went to the county prison at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday to receive the files, seals, and various documents. He did not complete the reception until 5:00 PM and officially took office.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Industrial Department Sends Personnel to Collect Cotton Seeds</h3>
<p>In order to investigate cotton and rice seeds in various provinces and select excellent seeds, the Agricultural Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry jointly hired Dr. Roff, an American agricultural expert, by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the Ministry of Industry to plan everything. It has dispatched technicians to various counties to collect rice seeds. This time, as cotton is about to be on the market, two groups of technicians were dispatched to investigate cotton seeds. One group went to the Xiang-E area, and the other group went to various counties in Jiangsu Province. They departed from Beijing on the 19th. Technicians Huang Jifang, Zheng Tihua, and Zhang Rujian went to Nantong first to collect from cotton areas and reclamation companies. They then went to Haimen and Qidong counties. Due to the rainy weather, the collected cotton ingots may rot. Zhang Rujian returned to Beijing first. Technicians Huang and Zheng came to Cheng from Tong yesterday (25th) and contacted Wu Liangfu of the Agricultural Extension Institute to collect excellent cotton seeds in the cotton-producing areas of Shazhou. They will stay for about two days and then go to Jiading, Liuhe, Shanghai, and Chongming counties.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang's Dispute Over the Custody of Jiao Hill's Books</h3>
<p>Jiao Hill has beautiful scenery, with many books collected from previous dynasties. In order to preserve the national quintessence, the provincial government hired several members to form a committee for custody. The former Department of Civil Affairs claimed that Commissioner Yang Hongfa reported that the members of the committee were scattered and requested a separate organization. The Department of Civil Affairs approved the case. Unexpectedly, the current provincial government received a letter from Commissioner Liu Yizheng, stating that the members of the committee were not scattered, and that Li Bingrong lived on the mountain without authorization, doing whatever he wanted. The custodian monks did not know what to do. The provincial government believed that the two sides held their own views and could not agree. It has ordered the Zhen County government to send personnel to investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Woman Chen Xingnian Commits Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<p>Chen Xingnian, a woman from Jiangdu, was just twenty years old. She had studied at Nanjing Xiaozhuang Normal School. Yesterday morning, she took a train from Nanjing to Zhenjiang. After arriving, she boarded a Zhenjiang-Yangzhou bus back to Yangzhou. However, when the Xin Zhenjiang steamer reached the center of the river, Chen suddenly threw her watch and glasses into the water one after another. Then, she jumped into the river and committed suicide. The passengers were greatly shocked. Soon after, Jia Songping, a fellow Jiangdu native on board, heard the news and generously said to the other passengers that he would pay twenty silver dollars if the woman could be rescued. At that time, there were two small rowboats nearby. The sailors on board immediately ordered the two boats to start the rescue. Fortunately, she was pulled out of the water not long after she went in, avoiding drowning. However, she was already barely breathing and unconscious. The woman was then sent to the first branch of the Third Public Security Bureau, and then transferred to the main bureau. When Officer Ding inquired about her name and the reason for her suicide, the woman firmly refused to tell the truth. Later, a search of her luggage revealed her name card and clothing, but nothing else. The incident was reported to Chen Yixuan, the woman's paternal uncle who lived at No. 24 Yangjia Gate. He rushed to the bureau and secured her release with a guarantor. According to Chen's family, the woman lived near the Liji Factory in Yangzhou. Her father worked in the salt industry and the family was moderately well-off. She went to Nanjing this time to look for work, but was unsuccessful. Also, she had a bad relationship with her stepmother, so she was too ashamed to return home, which led to the thought of suicide. It is also reported that the woman has been sent to a certain hospital by the Chen family for treatment.</p>
<h3>Salt Smugglers Cause Disturbances Along the Coast of Nantong and Tonghai</h3>
<p>Recently, in the coastal areas of Nantong and Haimen counties, such as Da'an and Dian ports along the Yangtze River, there have been a large number of private salt smugglers from the Haizhou area of Shandong. These people collude with pirates and have become quite powerful, causing great disturbances. Xu Yonghua, the fourth district chief of the Huainan Tax Police, has specifically dispatched his troops to suppress them.</p>
<h3>Yellow Snow Falls in Lujing Port</h3>
<p>Around 1:00 PM on the 25th, the sky suddenly darkened in the Lujing Port area of Nantong. Then, yellow snow fell, melting upon touching the ground. The weather cleared up in about five minutes.</p>
<h3>Silk Reeling Workers Strike in Jiaxing</h3>
<p>The silk reeling department of the Weicheng Silk Factory outside the East Gate of Jiaxing has now been leased to Qingji. It only started operating this month. Now, some of the workers in the department are demanding a wage increase, but the factory refused. Therefore, the workers went on strike on the 27th. Some workers who wanted to work were also prevented from doing so. The factory telegraphed the Public Security Bureau to send police to stop them. Director Gao dispatched Inspector Cheng Taichang to persuade them to resume work.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou-Huzhou Steamer Robbed in Shuanglin</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou-Huzhou night steamer left Hangzhou around 4:00 PM on the 23rd. On the way, in Hongchang Village, about fifteen li from Dongzha in Shuanglin, two small boats that looked like duck boats suddenly appeared, carrying seven bandits. One bandit fired a wooden-cased gun at the steamer and ordered it to stop. The bandits then jumped onto the steamer and robbed extensively, with no passenger spared. The total loss was over a thousand yuan. The steamer arrived in Huzhou at 7:30 AM yesterday and immediately reported the incident to the military and political authorities for investigation.</p>
<h3>Total Autumn Cocoon Harvest in Various Counties of Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction promotes autumn silkworm rearing and the expansion of improved silkworm breeds. The Hall of Administration controls and manages these efforts, and a total of 210,000 sheets of improved autumn breeds were distributed to various counties for rearing, resulting in a rich harvest. Now, the cocoon collection at various cocoon exchanges has come to an end, and all scales have been stopped. The average price of fresh silk is 30.4 yuan. The approximate cocoon production in various counties is as follows: Xiaoshan First Model District: 10,000 dan; Lin'an Second Model District: 1,400 dan; Improved District Wuxing: 2,100 dan; Jiaxing: 4,900 dan; Hangzhou County: 6,000 dan; Haiyan: 5,200 dan; Haining: 3,000 dan; Sheng County: 2,650 dan; Zhuji: 1,700 dan; Yuhang: 750 dan; Wukang: 600 dan; Changxing: 340 dan; Anji: 700 dan; Hangzhou City: 3,600 dan; Chongde, Deqing, Xindeng, Pinghu, Xinchang, Yuqian, and other counties: approximately 2,000 dan. According to the report statistics, the total amount in the province is over 45,000 dan. The total amount of cocoon money and expenses required by various cocoon exchanges is over 1.8 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Cicheng Digging Artesian Well</h3>
<p>People from this county, as well as Shanghai gentry and merchants such as Lin Lianchen, recognizing that the river channels in their hometown are silted up, the drinking water is unclean, and there is no source of water in case of drought, have specifically hired a marine engineer to dig an artesian well in the Shilongtang area of the city. Work began several months ago. At first, manual digging was used, but later, due to the slow progress, machines were used. Recently, more than 130 feet of stone and mud have been dug, and even more than five feet of hard rock layer have been dug down. It is estimated that one and a half feet can be dug per day. It is estimated that after the well is completed, the drinking water for the entire city can be supplied. Because of the huge cost, donations have been solicited from various places one after another, and it is currently being actively carried out.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Jiang Zuobin Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday for Talks</h3>
<p>Will Return to His Post in Japan Within a Week</p>
<p>The Responsibility for Breaking the Sino-Japanese Deadlock Lies with the Japanese Side</p>
<p>There is No Reason for the Japanese Ambassador to China to be Changed Easily</p>
<p>Jiang Zuobin, the ambassador to Japan, was ordered to return to his post immediately. He left Beijing the night before and got off the train in Suzhou yesterday morning to attend to private matters. He arrived in Shanghai at 2:30 PM yesterday. Our reporter specifically interviewed him at his residence yesterday. Jiang said that he would take a boat to Japan within a week. Whether the Sino-Japanese deadlock can be broken completely depends on the Japanese side. The details of his conversation are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Will Go to Japan Within a Week</h3>
<p>Jiang said first, "My illness has now completely recovered. I am waiting for a boat to Japan in Shanghai. The exact date has not yet been determined, but it should be possible within a week. Secretary Ding Shaoji is still staying in Beiping for private matters and will come south soon to go to Japan with me. The rumor that the embassy in Japan will be expanded is not true. Only the external staff will be slightly adjusted."</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota</h3>
<p>The reporter asked about the new Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, his personality and policies. Jiang said, "Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota has many acquaintances among our party and national leaders, and he is also very familiar with the situation in our country. However, it is unlikely that he will be able to break away from the military's advocacy in diplomacy and break the deadlock of restraint."</p>
<h3>The Sino-Japanese Deadlock</h3>
<p>The reporter then asked whether there is any possibility of breaking the Sino-Japanese deadlock in the short term. Jiang answered without hesitation, "Whether the Sino-Japanese deadlock can be broken depends entirely on Japan, not China. Because Japan is an aggressor country, if the Japanese side can truly realize and recognize the facts, the deadlock can be broken. Otherwise, there is no way." Jiang also said that the Japanese government relies heavily on the Japanese ambassador to China, Akira Ariyoshi, and there is no reason to change him easily. The rumor that Arita will be sent to China is not true.</p>
<h3>Will Visit Huang Fu</h3>
<p>Jiang also said that he had not yet met with Huang Yingbai, chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee, in Shanghai, and planned to visit him tomorrow (today). Jiang expressed his regret that the actions of Fang Zhenwu, Ji Hongchang, and others in North China gave the Japanese an excuse to practice mutual slaughter under the guise of patriotism. Jiang was in Suzhou yesterday morning to visit the stonemason Tang Boquan to prepare an epitaph for his late mother.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Talks About His Impressions of the Northwest Inspection</h3>
<p>Shanxi Province Actively Engaged in Construction</p>
<p>Visited Song Ziwen and Huang Fu Yesterday</p>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong, the Minister of Interior, went to the Northwest to inspect the provinces of Shanxi and Suiyuan. He then went to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on everything. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning by night express train. Yesterday afternoon, he visited Finance Minister Song Ziwen and Huang Fu, and met with reporters from various newspapers. The following is a record of his conversation:</p>
<h3>Shanxi Province's Construction Has Achieved Considerable Results</h3>
<p>According to Huang, "This time I went from Beijing to Ping, then to Shanxi. I stayed in Taiyuan for a short time. Mr. Yan Xishan is now working hard on construction. The provincial government has an Economic Control Office and a Financial Reorganization Office. The Economic Control Office is specifically responsible for economic construction, converting the arsenal into a manufacturing plant, and producing various necessities such as cloth. It is also testing the production of charcoal cars, and four have already been completed, which are quite practical and can carry heavy loads for long distances. Therefore, all construction is very impressive. The Financial Reorganization Office is responsible for financial reorganization. The currency system in Shanxi Province was originally very complicated, and financial management was not unified, so the office was established to plan and reorganize."</p>
<h3>Yan's Intentions Follow the Central Government</h3>
<p>He continued, "Mr. Yan's attitude is quite calm. I met with him in Taiyuan. He is now focusing on the construction of Shanxi Province and does not seem to want to be involved in national affairs. However, his intentions follow the Central Government, and all administrative matters in Shanxi Province follow the intentions of the Central Government." "After leaving Taiyuan, I entered Suiyuan and stayed there for a long time, but I returned before reaching Baotou. Transportation in Suiyuan is still convenient. The speed of the Ping-Sui Railway through Nankou is very slow, because it was destroyed by the Feng-Zhi war. Although it has been repaired, it is not yet fully restored."</p>
<h3>Order in Suiyuan is Still Stable</h3>
<p>"As for the order in Suiyuan, it is still stable. There is no chaos in military, political, and other aspects. Sun Dianying's troops were originally ordered to go to Qinghai for reclamation and have already received a considerable amount of travel expenses, but they are still staying in Baotou on the border of Suiyuan and have not yet entered Qinghai Province."</p>
<h3>Abundant Resources but Lack of Talent</h3>
<p>Huang continued, "Both Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces are very rich in resources. Shanxi Province has many coal mines, and Suiyuan has many agricultural products, such as sugar beets and potatoes, which are produced in abundance. Sugar beets can be used to make sugar, and potatoes can be used to make starch. Both can also produce alcohol as a byproduct. The province is also suitable for animal husbandry, and wool and leather are exported in large quantities. Each person in the province only needs six yuan per year to make a living, which shows how low the living standard is. It is a pity that although the resources are abundant, there is a lack of talent. Without human labor, they cannot be developed, and without money, how can they be used?"</p>
<h3>The Rise of Fang Ji Has Some Impact</h3>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked about the situation after the war zone was taken over. According to reports, most of the North China war zone has been taken over, but there are still some places, such as Yuguan, where the Japanese army has not completely withdrawn. The rise of Fang (Zhenwu) and Ji (Hongchang) will also affect the issue of taking over the war zone. According to a telegram from Peiping, Fang and Ji are not to be feared, but their background is worrying. This statement seems to be not without reason. Huang also said, "I went to Xunyang to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek completely to report on the inspection and had no other tasks. I will stay in Shanghai for a day or two and then return to Beijing."</p>
<h3>The Trip to Mongolia is Undecided, Visiting Song and Huang</h3>
<p>Regarding the central government's decision to send Huang and Bai Yunti, a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, to guide the autonomy after the Mongolian princes announced autonomy in Inner Mongolia, according to Huang, the departure date has not yet been determined. After arriving in Shanghai, Huang rested at his residence in the morning. Around 3:00 PM, he first went to No. 501 West Aisi Road to meet with Finance Minister Song Ziwen, and talked for about fifty minutes before leaving. He then went to Qiqi Road to visit Huang Fu, chairman of the Peiping Political Affairs Committee, and talked for an hour. According to Huang, the visit to Song and Huang was because they had not seen each other for a long time and he just had a brief report. It was only heard that Huang came to Shanghai to discuss the disposal of the North China issue and urged Huang to go north as soon as possible to preside over the administration on behalf of the central government.</p>
<h3>British Envoy Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Go to Beijing in a Few Days to Say Goodbye to Our Authorities</p>
<p>British Minister Sir Miles Lampson, by order of the British Government, has been transferred to be the High Commissioner for Egypt and Sudan, and will soon leave his post to take up his new position in Egypt. Therefore, he took a China National Aviation Corporation plane from Beijing yesterday morning with the embassy counselor Taikeman and the staff member Scott, and arrived at Longhua Airport at 3:40 PM in the afternoon. The British Consul in Shanghai and the Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Ma Xier, and others all went to welcome him. After arriving in Shanghai, Sir Lampson went to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund to rest around 5:00 PM in the afternoon. Sir Lampson will stay in Shanghai for about a week and then go to Beijing to bid farewell to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>French Envoy Weilit De Has Entered Beijing</h3>
<p>French Aviator Will Not Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency said that the French consulate denied yesterday morning that the French envoy Weilit De was in Shanghai, saying that he had already taken a train to Beijing on the evening of the 25th. The French aviator is currently planning to fly to Japan and then return to Europe via Siberia and will not come to Shanghai. The report that he would arrive in Shanghai from Vladivostok on the 28th is not accurate.</p>
<h3>Swedish Prince Left for Hong Kong Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Prince Karl of Sweden, who came to China for a visit this time, arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month and had been to Beijing and Peiping, and was welcomed by people from all over the place. Karl returned here from Peiping in the middle of this month, and after a little rest, he took the Japanese Empress liner to Hong Kong yesterday morning. The Customs specially prepared a Jingguang small steamer to send him on board. Those who saw him off in Shanghai included Tang Shixuan, the representative of Mayor Wu, Yu Ming, the director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhao Tiezhang, the section chief, and Mr. Hedman, the Swedish acting consul general, and Mr. Sigaofu. It is said that Karl will travel in Hong Kong for a while and then return to Europe.</p>
<h3>French Consul General Visited Mayor Wu Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing the Solution to the Issue of Police Rights on Haig Road</p>
<p>The French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Meli Ai, drove to the Municipal Government in Fenglin Bridge at 10:00 AM yesterday to visit Mayor Wu Tiecheng. Mayor Wu personally received him until nearly 11:00 AM before he left. It is said that what Mr. Meli and Mayor Wu talked about was the issue of police rights on Haig Road on the border between China and France. Although the Municipal Government and the French Consulate General had once made a written representation, the reply given by the French Consul General failed to satisfy the Municipal Government. Therefore, the French Consul General specially went to the Municipal Government to discuss the solution with Mayor Wu.</p>
<h3>Yin Rugeng Visited Huang Fu Yesterday to Report on the Situation in North China</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency said that Yin Rugeng, a member of the North China War Zone Reception Committee, visited Huang Yingbai around 11:00 AM yesterday to report on the recent situation in North China. According to Yin, Huang plans to return to Peiping around the end of this month, but the exact date of departure from Shanghai has not yet been decided. He himself will go north again after Huang leaves Shanghai. The rumor that Huang is being passive is not true. As for the North China War Zone, except for a few counties outside the Great Wall, the reception has already been completed. However, due to the recent situation in North China, it is different from before. (Note that this refers to the fact that after Fang Ji and Lao Haozi and others caused disturbances in Pingbei and Luandong, the Japanese army again used it as an excuse to station troops.) As for the issue of receiving the counties outside the Great Wall, according to the provisions of the truce agreement, the Japanese soldiers must withdraw to the Great Wall. Therefore, the reception is slightly tricky. However, in terms of the boundary of Hebei Province, it is not bounded by the Great Wall. Therefore, although the Japanese army only withdrew to the Great Wall line according to the truce agreement, the administration of the counties outside the Great Wall will still be exercised by our side. Therefore, this matter should be discussed further. Also, Yin visited Jiang Zuobin around 3:00 PM yesterday and had a conversation.</p>
<h3>Miao Zhongxiu Describes the Situation of the Silk Industry in the United States</h3>
<p>Japan Seizes Chinese Silk in the American Market</p>
<p>Overseas Trade Needs to Be Improved Urgently</p>
<p>Miao Zhongxiu, director of the Raw Silk Department of the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, went to the United States in early May of this year to investigate the silk industry at the invitation of silk industry groups. He returned to China the day before yesterday. Yesterday, Miao published his impressions of the trip, detailing the reasons for the failure of Chinese silk sales in the United States. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>The American Silk Weaving Industry is Gradually Recovering</h3>
<p>In the past few years, the American silk weaving industry has been affected by the depression, and the economic situation has been extremely exhausted. The large factories have been hit even harder. Therefore, they have reduced their scale and rely on the maintenance of banks to survive. In the past year, they have gradually recovered. Recently, after the government implemented the economic recovery movement, silk shops, fearing a sharp rise in prices, have seen their sales turn strong and have ordered goods one after another. The factories have suddenly become active, as if they were as prosperous as before 1919. It is a pity that this is only temporary excitement. Whether the shops' orders can be sold out and continue to be added is still a problem.</p>
<h3>American Women Prefer to Use Artificial Silk</h3>
<p>The sales of artificial silk in the United States have been very prosperous in the past two years. The reasons are nothing more than low prices, uniform quality, and the strong promotion of artificial silk factories. The promotion method is designed by the group, and artificial silk fabrics are made into clothing and displayed for publicity. After each factory sells its goods, it sends technical personnel to the user's factory to guide the use. Therefore, in the past two years, the number of silk factories that use artificial silk has increased. Moreover, after the purchasing power of the American people has decreased, women only seek beautiful and cheap clothes, and do not ask whether the raw material is real silk or whether it is durable. Silk factories only seek to produce goods that are easy to sell and profitable, and do not ask whether the raw material used is real silk or artificial silk. Most of them use artificial silk, with silk factories being the most. Even 70% of the raw materials are artificial silk. The second largest user is silk stocking factories, but the sales volume of stocking factories is very small.</p>
<h3>Spare No Effort to Promote Raw Silk</h3>
<p>The American silk weaving industry can be roughly divided into silk factories, silk stocking factories, and silk thread factories. Each factory produces different products. The Japanese silk industry is making increasing progress, and the output of high-end products is also increasing. The American silk weaving industry is also increasing the use of raw silk. Therefore, the future of raw silk will not be reduced by the crowding out of artificial silk. Because raw silk has its own characteristics, it cannot be replaced by artificial silk.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Failure of Chinese Silk Sales in the United States</h3>
<p>As for the failure of Chinese silk sales in the United States, the important reasons are listed on the left: (1) Chinese silk sales in the United States have always been in the hands of foreigners. Although there were several Chinese merchants engaged in raw silk business a few years ago, none of them directly promoted it overseas, but only entrusted foreign representatives to sell it. And whether the sales were effective and whether the economic ability of the buyers was reliable was unknown. Once hit, they all stopped business. Today, the only one that is independent is Tongyun. Selling Chinese silk through foreign merchants not only cannot make clear the progress and needs of the American silk weaving industry, but also the promotion is ineffective. Recently, the promotion of raw silk has become a specialized service. It cannot be regarded as the same as selling other raw silks. To promote raw silk, you must first understand its needs. For the quality, you must make the buyer have a deep trust, and then sell it to them, and then supply them with a continuous supply of goods for their use. (2) In terms of quality, the most unsuitable key point is direct reeling. The second is uniformity. Chinese silk is characterized by the fineness of the silk and the female workers are accustomed to paying attention to the uniformity of the strands. Those who are responsible for improving silk should pay special attention to this point and never use products with thick strands in order to reduce costs, which will lose the characteristics of Chinese silk. (3) In terms of price, the price of uniform and good ones is too high, and stocking factories are daunted. The American market cannot give low-grade ones the same price as Japanese silk of the same grade. (4) The lack of spot goods is also an important reason. After the American silk industry was hit, its economic strength was weak and it could not order futures. And the patterns change from time to time, and the raw materials cannot be pre-ordered. Therefore, the sales of futures are not as many as in previous years. In the American market, Japanese silk has a lot of stock and can be purchased at any time. Even if the futures are not timely, they can be exchanged at any time. Unlike Chinese silk, if it is not timely, there is no way to solve it except by selling it at a discount.</p>
<h3>I Have Joined the Silk Association</h3>
<p>American people have a better feeling for our country. If the above four points can be corrected, the future of Chinese silk is very promising. Recently, New York silk merchants have organized the International Silk Association to carry out raw silk propaganda to compete with artificial silk. Japan, Italy, France, and other countries have all joined. On our side, the association has telegraphed Mr. Xue Shouhuan, the manager of Yongtai Silk Factory, and Mr. He Bingxian, the director of the International Trade Bureau, to join as honorary members. It is a pity that our country was unable to participate in the International Silk Conference held in Paris next month.</p>
<h3>The Yellow River Disaster Relief Association Held Three Regular Meetings Yesterday</h3>
<p>It Was Resolved to Request the Government to Increase Relief Funds</p>
<p>And Hold Fund-Raising in Hartung Garden</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Charity Organizations in Shanghai Raising Funds for the Yellow River Flood Disaster held its third executive meeting at Renji Hall at 4:00 PM yesterday. The attending members were Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Ziqiao, Zhao Jinqing, Huang Bodu, Guan Jiongzhi, Zheng Hongnian, Wen Lanting, Li Qingxuan, Qian Jingping, Du Yuesheng (represented by Li Zicai), Wang Rutang (represented by Liu Yunfang), and Li Zushen (represented by Liu), more than ten people in total. Huang Hanzhi chaired the meeting. The details of each situation are as follows:</p>
<h3>Report Items</h3>
<p>The chairman reported: (1) From the date of establishment to September 26, a total of 13,311.5 silver dollars were received for disaster relief. (2) From September 20 to September 26, a total of relief supplies were received and distributed (attached list). (3) On the same date, a total of 26 documents and 6 telegrams were received. (4) On the same date, a total of 24 documents and 8 telegrams were sent.</p>
<h3>Discussion Items</h3>
<p>(1) The telegram from the Hongsan Buddhist monk and the telegram copied by the Red Cross Society, "The disaster is extremely severe, affecting more than 20 counties. In Huaxian County alone, more than 600 villages have been submerged, and 20,000 county residents have drowned. Recently, there has been an epidemic, and the situation is extremely tragic. The funds allocated are not enough to relieve even this one county, not to mention that other counties cannot be neglected. Please raise a large amount of money quickly to benefit the disaster victims." It was resolved to make an effort to raise money. (2) The letter from the Yellow River Flood Disaster Relief Association of the Three Counties in Southern Hebei said, "Millions of disaster victims in Changyuan, Dongming, and Puyang counties in Southern Hebei are in distress, without food or clothing, and are exposed to the wind and dew, waiting to be fed. We recommend that Mr. Han Zhensheng be the representative to go and make a personal statement. Please give your support to raise a large amount of money to distribute emergency relief to save the disaster victims." It was resolved to ask Qu Wenliu and Feng Yangshan to handle it nearby. (3) The report from the disaster victim representatives Zhang Qin and others from Changyuan County, copied by Executive Committee member Zhu Ziqiao, describes the situation after the Yellow River passed and the disaster relief opinions, with two attached maps. It was resolved to follow the above. (4) The letter from the Chinese Jisheng Association, "For the first wind and water disasters in Baoshan, our association has already distributed emergency relief in Shidong and other sands opposite Wusong. Yesterday, according to the report from the gentry and people of the county to the association, there have been secondary wind and water disasters, which are more serious than before. There are a total of more than 10,000 disaster victims who need urgent help, building straw sheds, distributing winter clothes, and building collapsed embankments. Our association is weak and appeals on behalf of them. We hope to raise a large amount of money quickly to distribute relief in installments." It was resolved that it is not within the scope of the Yellow River Flood Disaster Association and should be the responsibility of the Xinmo Relief Association for relief. (5) The letter from Executive Committee member Tang Haian, "The last executive meeting proposed to issue horse tickets with prizes. After going to see Mayor Wu to solicit his opinion, he said that the matter of issuing prize tickets must be submitted to the Municipal Council for resolution." It was resolved to send a letter to the Municipal Government so that it can be submitted to the council. (6) The motion to request the government to increase relief funds was passed. (7) The motion to raise relief funds in Hartung Garden was resolved to be contacted by the three members Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, and Zhu Ziqiao, with Wang Xiaolai writing a letter. (8) The motion to raise relief funds in Beijing and Nanjing theaters was resolved to be contacted by Executive Committee member Zheng Hongnian. (9) The motion to invite Executive Committee member Shi Liangcai to preside over the meeting was passed.</p>
<h3>The Yangtze River Water Level Drops Sharply</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Changsha Steamer Service Suspended</p>
<p>In recent days, the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has dropped sharply. In the past week, the river water upstream of Yichang has even plunged straight down, with a decrease of more than ten feet in one day. The drop in Changsha, Hunan, is even more severe. According to an urgent telegram report received by various shipping companies in Shanghai from Changsha, the water level in that port on the 25th of this month has dropped to only one foot and nine inches, which is very rare. As a result, water traffic in Hunan has been affected by the receding water and has been completely cut off. All the river steamers on the Xiang-Han route have been suspended. The Shanghai-Changsha direct ships of the Taikoo Company have also suspended the route since receiving the news of the drop in the water level. From yesterday onwards, they have refused to accept export goods from Changsha. The water in Yichang has also dropped, but it is still at nineteen feet. The Hankou water gauge has also been gradually declining in recent days, having dropped from twenty-seven feet to twenty-three feet and five inches.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Municipal Citizens' Patriotic Products Promotion Association Held a General Membership Meeting</h3>
<p>Re-electing Executive and Supervisory Committee Members</p>
<p>Soliciting Achievements for Awards</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Patriotic Products Promotion Association held its 14th general membership meeting at 2 PM yesterday, re-electing executive and supervisory committee members, welcoming new members, and holding an awards ceremony for soliciting achievements. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attendees: Those present yesterday included Wu Tiecheng (represented by Li Dachao), Mrs. Wu Tiecheng, Mrs. Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaolai, Lu Wenshao, Wang Yansong, Li Dachao, Fang Yexian, Wang Jiean, Hu Xiyuan, Guo Shun, Hu Fengxiang, Chen Liangyu, Wu Zhihao, Zhang Yichen, Shi Zhikun, Feng Shaoshan, Chen Yiting, Shao Daren, Chen Binghui, Sun Daosheng, Xu Tingzuo, Fang Jiange, and over five hundred others. They elected Wang Xiaolai, Wu Zhihao, Lu Wenshao, Shao Daren, Fang Yexian, Chen Yiting, and Sun Daosheng as the seven-member presidium for the general membership meeting. Feng Shaoshan, Chen Yiting, and Xu Tingzuo were the presidium for the welcoming ceremony, and Li Dachao and Fang Jiange were the presidium for the awards ceremony.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the General Membership Meeting, reported, saying in brief: "This is already the 14th general membership meeting of our association. There is no need to say more about promoting domestic products, as everyone is enthusiastic. However, I have a few words to say. A 14-year annual meeting is like a 14-year-old person. The period of 14 years old is the most precious and the most worthy of cherishing. Learning to be a person is the most critical juncture, and one must work hard to achieve self-reliance. Otherwise, there will be a sigh of regret when one is old. The Patriotic Products Promotion Association certainly has the same feeling. Fourteen years ago, our association members felt that the rights and interests were overflowing outward, and were anxious to recover the leaks. At that time, national disasters, although common, had not yet reached the great disasters of September 18th and January 28th. The current period is even more critical than before. If we do not actively move forward, we will truly be waiting for the country to perish. We must learn the spirit of the Japanese who do not use foreign goods. The Japanese only wear Western suits when meeting foreign guests, and the rest of the time they are always in kimonos. They use their own domestic products for everything, so their country can become so strong. We are blindly ignorant of self-love, so we are bullied by the Japanese. Some people say that promoting domestic products is useless, and foreign goods cannot be resisted. This is extremely absurd. May I ask, before our country opened its sea ban, everyone did not use foreign goods and lived very well. Why can't we not use foreign goods now? If foreigners break our country and block our sea routes, can we still buy foreign goods? I hope everyone will be of one heart and one mind from now on, and stop being confused. We must promote domestic products, not only to promote sales in China, but also to develop outward."</p>
<p>Association Affairs Report: Next, Chen Yiting reported on association affairs, saying in brief: "Since the establishment of our association in the ninth year of the Republic of China, there have been 29 domestic product exhibitions. Not only Shanghai, but also other treaty ports have held exhibitions, and they have been very popular with the people. As for the promotion of domestic products before the ninth year of the Republic of China, it was not very popular. Therefore, I feel that the achievements in the past 13 sessions cannot be said to be non-existent. Regarding internal financial matters, this session's income was 3,780 yuan, and expenses were 2,080 yuan, leaving a surplus. The results of the solicitation team were a total of 12,000 points. In terms of money, we only move the interest and not the principal, so our association can barely stand on its own feet. Although there is no great achievement, there is also no fault. Now the 13th session is over, and I hope to develop further in the future. The members of this session sincerely hand over the purpose of promoting domestic products to the members of the next session, and everyone will work together."</p>
<p>Speeches by Guests: Afterwards, Li Dachao's representative, Mayor Wu, and Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Department, gave speeches, both generally offering words of encouragement and consolation for the promotion of domestic products. Then, Shao Daren, the member who solicited the most points, reported on his achievements, and committee members Sun Daosheng, Chen Liangyu, and Lu Wenshao gave speeches. Next, Wu Zhihao gave a reply, the length of which is omitted. Then came the election.</p>
<p>Awards to Team Leaders: Next, the awards ceremony for soliciting achievements was held. Among the award recipients, Shao Daren solicited the most points, and Qian Lijun obtained the most members. They were each awarded a silver pagoda by Captain Wu. Chen Kangfeng, Sun Daosheng, Wu Zhihao, and others were each awarded a silver tripod by Chief of Staff Pan. Chen Yiting and Wu Tiecheng were each awarded a silver cup by the association. Hu Xiyuan, Guo Shun, Zhang Qingfa, Yan Zhifang, Fang Yexian, Dai Gengxin, Gu Shaoqing, Chen Binghui, Fang Jiaobo, Xu Jian, and other team leaders were each awarded a silver shield. Other team leaders who solicited more than 100 points were also each awarded a silver shield. In addition, the enlarged photos of the top three team leaders who solicited the most members were hung in the hall to show honor. The various awards were decided by the preparatory meeting, which invited Mrs. Mayor Wu and Mrs. Director Pan to present the awards separately. Chairman Chen Yiting of the conference presented a silver pagoda to Wu Tiecheng and Pan Gongzhan, and Fang Jiange presented a basket of flowers to Mrs. Wu and Mrs. Pan.</p>
<p>Entertainment Performances: Finally, Shanghai's famous entertainers Zhu Xiangfei and He Shuangdai performed, as well as the comedic master Yi Fangshuo. Jingqin Girls' School performed singing and dancing, and the Zhonghua Qiangmin Troupe performed martial arts to increase the interest of the members. The meeting did not end until the lights of thousands of homes were lit.</p>
<p>Election Results Revealed: After the members arrived, they first filled out ballots and put them into ballot boxes. At 4:15 PM, Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Department, opened the ballot boxes, and publicly elected more than ten ballot counters and talliers to sort and tally the ballots. The ballot counting process was completed at 8:20 PM, and the results were announced as follows: Chen Binghui, Xu Jianruo, Hu Xiyuan, Fang Jiange, Dong Boying, Zhang Dezhai, Sun Daosheng, Lin Guyun, Qian Lijun, Gao Shiheng, Shao Daren, Xu Wengui, Chen Kangnian, Cheng Pengnian, Zhu Dechao, Xi Guansheng, Wang Jiean, Chen Yiting, Feng Shaoshan, Chen Jusheng, Xu Genghua, Wu Zhihao, Yu Qiaqing, Liu Zhongying, Hu Fengxiang, Guo Shun, and 26 others were elected as the 14th Executive Committee members. Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaolai, Lao Jingxiu, Yuan Ludeng, Dai Gengxin, Pan Haichun, Ren Shigang, Hu Zuan, Lu Wenshao and nine others were elected as the 14th Supervisory Committee members.</p>
<h3>China Urgently Needs to Develop Aviation</h3>
<p>Remarks by Sir Hichins</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that the Hong Kong government recently decided to provide convenience to enable Hong Kong to become an important aviation hub in the future. As a result, the Far East Aviation Company has obtained the approval of the Hong Kong government to establish an aviation school in Hong Kong to teach various advanced aviation technologies. This move has been in preparation for a long time, and is expected to be successful by the end of this year or January next year. It has also been approved by the British Aviation Department. In the future, when classes begin, everything will be modeled after the British Royal Air Force, teaching completely new technologies, so that students can become first-class pilots and be proficient in all aviation-related academics. They will also practice flying various British aircraft. Young people from all countries who aspire to this can register for studies. It is expected that there will be no shortage of students from all parts of China who will enroll in this school. Sir Hichins, the Chairman of the British Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft Company and Aviation Training Company, has been in Shanghai for nearly five months. Today (the 27th) he took the "Nichi-go" south. The Sir will stay in Hong Kong for a short time, and then he will probably return to England via India. Yesterday (26th), the Sir stated that his trip to the South was not specifically for the establishment of the Far East Aviation Company's aviation school in Hong Kong. However, after arriving in Hong Kong, he will certainly discuss this with the local authorities. His main purpose is to investigate the aviation situation in Hong Kong and South China. He has been in Shanghai for several months, and based on his observations, he firmly believes that the prospects for the development of civil aviation in China are unlimited. China urgently needs to build an efficient air force in accordance with the principles of the new era, and it seems to have begun to do so. However, the most important thing to pay attention to is that you cannot only focus on buying airplanes, and then neglect the ground-based aviation facilities due to lack of funds.</p>

If the cotton clothes arrive, they will be transported to the disaster area for distribution immediately. San is currently staying at the Buddhist Society in Biancheng, and will also wait for the first batch of funds to arrive before finding a way to transport them to the disaster area and proceed.

<h3>News from Various Charity Groups Raising Funds</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association is organizing emergency relief for the tidal disasters in Chongming and Qidong, summarized as follows: Chongming: The association has already sent a special commissioner, Chai Yuyu, to investigate. Yesterday, he reported that the disaster situation in the fifth and third districts was severe. He was immediately ordered to stay in Chongming to quickly form a temporary office of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association to plan and implement emergency relief measures. On one hand, Director Lu Bohong of the association asked the Tianci Steamship Bureau to first load 300 piculs of white rice and various medicines at no charge, to rush to relieve the disaster victims trapped in the water.</p>
<p>Qidong: This time, after the hurricane passed, many embankments in the northeast coastal and southeast riverside areas of the county were washed away by huge waves. The ground is still several feet deep in water. People have no homes to return to and are sleeping in the fields. The autumn wind is strong, and they are crying from hunger and cold, in a precarious situation. The association is actively preparing to implement emergency relief measures.</p>
<p>Baoshan: Changxing, Dongxin, Panjia, Shitou, Ruifeng, and Wu Sha Zhou in the county suffered a terrible storm surge on the 2nd of this month, and the disaster was extremely tragic. The people are all in the water, and food has been cut off. The association is procuring food and will transport it to provide assistance to avoid the starvation of the Wu Sha disaster victims.</p>
<p>Chuansha: The association is rushing to complete the emergency relief with the Jisheng Society when another storm surge occurred. In addition, Chongming, Qidong, and Baoshan were all hit by terrible disasters at the same time. They are deeply troubled by the lack of relief funds. Those in charge are restless and eagerly hope that all sectors of society will help to meet this urgent need.</p>
<p>Jingyanzizi moved to assist in relief. The descendants of the late Xiyuan Elder's 50th anniversary, yesterday, in view of the extremely tragic floods in Chongming and Qidong, specially transferred 1,000 yuan from the Jingyan funds to buy food and clothing to assist in relief, which was entrusted to the association for distribution.</p>

<p>Family assistance in relief. Nie Chongde Hall, in view of the severe floods this autumn, frugally economized on clothing and food, and donated 500 yuan, entrusting the association to distribute it in the disaster areas. The Chinese Red Cross Society is handling disaster relief in various places, and the news is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Typhoon Disaster: After the typhoon and hurricane passed through Shanghai, Pudong, Chuansha, Nanhui and other places were particularly affected. The disaster victims urgently need relief. The Chairman of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Wen Lantin, forwarded a request to the Chairman of the Board, Wang Peiyuan, to urgently contact various agencies in Southeast Asia to appeal for relief.</p>
<p>Yellow River Disaster: The Chinese Red Cross Society, in view of the severe Yellow River flood this year, the vast disaster area, and the tens of millions of disaster victims who are hungry and homeless, previously sent telegrams to Manila, the American Red Cross branch, the International Red Cross in Geneva, and the Red Cross League in Paris, asking them to forward the appeal to Red Cross societies around the world to raise funds to relieve the disaster victims. Now, we have learned that the association has recently received reply telegrams from the International Red Cross and the Red Cross League, saying that they have forwarded telegrams to all parties to appeal for the disaster victims of the Yellow River flood in China. Funds will soon be remitted to relieve the disaster victims.</p>

<h3>Shao Lizhi Replied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce that Shaanxi Province Did Not Discuss Increasing the Cigarette Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, having heard that Shaanxi Province was increasing cigarette tax rates to fund disaster relief, which would harm the cigarette industry, telegraphed the Chairman of Shaanxi Province, asking for an exemption. We now know that Chairman Shao Lizhi of Shaanxi replied yesterday in a telegram, the original text of which reads: "Public Gaze of the City Chamber of Commerce, I recently received a telegram stating that this province intends to increase the cigarette tax rate to 120% due to disaster relief, and requesting an exemption. After investigation, there is no proposal to increase the cigarette tax rate in this province's disaster relief measures. What is said in the telegram is probably based on inaccurate rumors. I am replying by telegram, Shao Lizhi."</p>

<h3>Cao Zhenfei's Resignation Approved</h3>

<p>Cao Zhenfei, Commissioner of the Fifth Administrative Region of Jiangsu Province and concurrently Magistrate of Shanghai County, has achieved remarkable political achievements since taking office, and is beloved by local people. However, Mr. Cao submitted a request to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to resign from all his concurrent positions due to poor health and inability to hold such a strenuous position for long, in order to recuperate.

<h3>Transshipment and Customs Declaration Industry Cables for Maintenance of Private Shipping</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications issued an order to implement through transportation by water and land, the Shanghai Sea Line has been contracted by the Longhai Railway Bureau and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to establish a through transportation contract, granting exclusive operation, which is monopolistic. Various shipowners in Shanghai have repeatedly telegraphed requesting maintenance. Yesterday, the transshipment and customs declaration industry, for transportation purposes, and in order to support private shipping, sent another telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Railways, saying, "The ministry ordered the implementation of responsible through transportation by water and land, and the Shanghai Sea Line has been contracted by the Longhai Railway and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, granting exclusive operation, which is equivalent to a monopoly. It seems that this is pushing down private shipping, and it is difficult to sit idly by and do nothing. I hope that you will uphold the Party platform and the spirit of public interest, and allow private shipping businesses to have equal treatment. We would be grateful." It is thought that the Executive Yuan and the Ministry will not turn a blind eye to public opinion and go their own way.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Organs Persuaded Fresh Pork Workers to Not Strike Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs Scheduled to Mediate Again Today</p>
<p>Fresh pork industry workers in the city, in order to demand an increase in wages, went on a two-hour slowdown the day before yesterday. Direct negotiations between labor and management that night broke down. Party and government organs persuaded the workers not to strike yesterday morning, and scheduled to mediate in accordance with the law today. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Negotiations Break Down: The Fresh Pork Industry Workers, through the labor union, proposed conditions for improving treatment and increasing wages. After the Municipal Party Department approved the conditions, the Bureau of Social Affairs repeatedly mediated. However, both labor and management insisted on the wage increase item, resulting in ineffective mediation. The day before yesterday afternoon, all workers voluntarily went on a two-hour slowdown to urge the capitalists to realize. That night, the Fresh Pork Industry Workers' Union and the Fresh Pork Industry Association directly negotiated. The capitalists agreed to increase wages by 2 yuan for workers earning up to 10 yuan, and by 1 yuan for those earning more than 10 yuan. The workers demanded increases of 2 yuan, 3 yuan, and 4 yuan, resulting in the breakdown of negotiations.</p>
<p>Persuading Against the Strike: After the direct negotiations broke down, the fresh pork workers prepared to strike across the board yesterday morning. After receiving the report, the Bureau of Social Affairs immediately dispatched mediator Zhu Guilin, together with Dai Youheng of the Municipal Party Department, to persuade them. All workers immediately accepted the suspension of the strike, and requested the withdrawal of the public security detectives stationed in various warehouses, in order to avoid misunderstandings by the workers. The two representatives of the Party and government have agreed to the request.</p>
<p>Mediation Today: The Bureau of Social Affairs scheduled to mediate again at 2:00 PM today, and notified both labor and management, saying, "Regarding the case of fresh pork industry workers demanding improved treatment, this bureau has scheduled to convene a mediation committee at 2:00 PM on September 28th. I hereby notify you to designate two responsible representatives to come to the bureau to await mediation. Sincerely, Director Wu Xingya."</p>
<h3>Requesting Exemption from Temporary Business Place Stamp Tax for the Domestic Goods Movement Exhibition</h3>
<p>The National Goods Movement Exhibition organized by the Municipal First Special District Citizens' Association and the China National Products Manufacturers Association, regarding the issue of affixing stamp tax to invoices for temporary business places, had previously sent a letter to the Stamp Tax Sub-Bureau, requesting an exemption in accordance with previous practice. However, the sub-bureau replied that it was not allowed. The association stated that previous National Exhibition meetings had never required stamps, and that even recently, cities such as the capital Nanjing, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Weihai, Dinghai, Yongjia, and Ningbo had all been exempt from stamps. Moreover, the promotion of domestic goods is a matter of national salvation, and the central government has repeatedly ordered it. If we were to break the precedent and impose harsh taxes on domestic goods factories through layers of exploitation, it would seem to violate the state's policy of encouraging production. Therefore, the association sent another letter to the sub-bureau the day before yesterday, requesting an exemption in accordance with precedent.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Labor Dispute at the Meihua Weaving Factory</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs' Mediation Determined Five Measures</p>
<p>The Meihua Weaving Factory on Lubosheng Road, Caojiadu, Shanghai West, recently suspended operations in July due to sluggish business. More than 100 male and female workers at the factory were concerned about their livelihoods due to the sudden unemployment. They appointed representatives Dai Baozhou, Shen Xiuying, and others to petition the Party and government organs several times, and put forward the following demands: 1. Please the factory to resume work quickly to maintain the workers' livelihood. 2. The workers should receive four years of bonus, totaling more than 2,000 yuan, and the factory should issue it quickly. 3. The factory should pay wages during the suspension period due to the delay in resuming work. Yesterday morning, the Bureau of Social Affairs summoned both labor and management to the bureau for mediation. Shen Zhaoyun, Wu Guozhang, and Shen Xianlin attended on behalf of labor, and Shi Zhaotai and Shen Zijun attended on behalf of management. Chen Liangping, Chairman of the Bureau of Social Affairs, first sought the opinions of both parties and then decided on the following measures: 1. The factory will resume work on October 4th. 2. Regarding the request for the factory to issue bonuses to the workers, the workers voluntarily withdraw it temporarily. 3. During the factory's suspension of work, the capitalists will subsidize each worker with 5 yuan for meals. 4. The factory shall not suspend work without reason in the future. 5. The workers must abide by the factory's management rules, which must first be submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs for approval and implementation. Both labor and management were satisfied and signed on the spot, announcing the resolution.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Union Dispatches Personnel to Organize Branches in Various Places</h3>

<h3>88th Division Army Games</h3>
<p>The program includes track and field, football, basketball, tennis, etc.</p>
<p>Initiate a military five-item movement that imitates military movements</p>
<p>– Held today at the Nanjing Provincial Stadium –</p>
<p>(Nanjing Electric News, 27th) The officers and soldiers of the 88th Division of Sun Yuanliang's troops will hold the first Autumn Games in Beijing on the 28th, 29th, and 30th. The games will be presided over by Chen Junmo, the director of sports for the division. More than 250 athletes have set out from their respective garrisons to arrive in Beijing. The 28th will be for track and field, and the 29th and 30th will be for ball games.</p>
<p>The 88th Division of the Army will hold the first Autumn Games in the capital. Sun Yuanliang, the commander of the 88th Division of the Army and an anti-Japanese general, has always promoted sports for the officers and soldiers of the division. Recently, in order to examine the sports performance of officers and soldiers, it was decided to hold the first Autumn Games at the Jiangsu Provincial Public Stadium in Nanjing on the 28th, 29th, and 30th of this month. The games will be presided over by Chen Junmo, the director of sports for the division. Preparations are almost complete, and the athletes from various units have set out from their respective garrisons to come to Beijing (such as Xuzhou, Danyang, etc.). As for the competition items, ball games are divided into three items: football, basketball, and tennis. Track and field has 13 items: 100 meters, 200 meters, 400 meters, 800 meters, 1500 meters, 3000 meters, 10,000 meters, high jump, long jump, shot put, discus, javelin, and pole vault. The two items of high hurdles and bull hurdles are temporarily missing due to the equipment of the army. The competition is based on each group as a unit, and the units directly under the division become one unit, for a total of seven units. In addition, Chen Junmo, the director of sports for the division, in order to promote military sports, has proposed a military five-item movement, including (1) Armed 100-meter prone race (assault style), (2) Armed 300-meter freestyle race, (3) Hand grenade throw, (4) Armed long jump, (5) Obstacle race, which is especially innovative. However, there is no corresponding standard for the scoring method. It is temporarily stipulated that the best score in each item is 1 point, the second best is 2 points, and so on. The person with the fewest points after adding the scores of the five items is the champion. If two people have the same score in a certain item, the average of the third place and the second place will be used to calculate the score. This kind of movement is very likely to arouse the interest of soldiers and is suitable for military needs. It is currently in the trial period. In the future, after multiple trials and strict review, it can become an objective score standard and be promoted to all armies in the country. It is truly a new invention in the military movement of our country.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medical College Basketball Team Wins</h3>
<p>The Chinese Medical College on North Henan Road, Laobazi Road in this port, has a large number of students this semester and is actively developing in all aspects. However, it has not paid attention to sports in the past. This semester, it also has a basketball team organization. It had a friendly match with Jian Guo Middle School in Zhabei yesterday in the school's gymnasium. The result of the match was 44 to 27. Victory belonged to the Chinese Medical College.</p>
<h3>Diary of the British Wimbledon World Tennis Tournament (XI)</h3>
<p>Special Correspondent from London, Yizhi Ji</p>
<p>July 7 (Friday), continued</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Farnes won the first set with six to four, but in reality, he should have won with six to two. After breaking Crawford's serve to make it five to two, there were no mistakes. Crawford's last shot in this game was a double fault. Farnes' future is full of hope. However, Crawford did not give up like this. He also broke Farnes' serve and then won his own serve. Farnes touched the net from time to time. In the next game, Farnes' first serve also went into the net, resulting in a double fault. Fortunately, Farnes still won this game, making it six to four. Crawford hit an extremely easy volley into the net, giving away this last point.</p>
<p>In the second set, the server won for nineteen consecutive games. It was easier for Farnes to win his serve than for Crawford. Farnes often had the potential to break through the opponent's serve, but they were all returned by Crawford. It is impossible to count the number of times the first serve scored a point. When Crawford took the lead with four to three, there was once a time. In the next game, Farnes also hit it in one shot, but it was cancelled due to a foot fault. He served again and still scored a point. The two people had almost no net-attacking strategy. In the ninth game, it seemed that Farnes could break through and advance, but Crawford repelled him again. Crawford attacked Farnes' backhand, but Farnes remained unmoved. Both people's forehands were fatal injuries to both sides, heavy and fast. Serving to score also made Farnes fight to five each. In the next game, Crawford made consecutive mistakes, zero-thirty, fifteen-forty. However, one of Farnes' volleys touched the net, and one shot went out of bounds. Crawford suddenly gained a way out, attacking fiercely and forcing Farnes to use a high ball to defend. After the equality, Farnes lost by a slight margin, and Crawford won. In the next game, Farnes served three consecutive times, scoring three consecutive points, until it became nine to nine. There was not much change. Both sides performed excellently. Crawford won ten to nine. Then Farnes' bad luck was discovered. Crawford won the first point by touching the ball. Farnes took the lead with thirty-fifteen. After the equality, Crawford took the lead again. Farnes touched the net again, and Crawford won this valuable second set with eleven to nine. In this glorious second set, almost every point had a fierce battle. Crawford's ball was stable and solid. Farnes' footwork was better, but there were more mistakes. Crawford's return of serve was even more special and amazing.</p>
<p>In the third set, Farnes was behind with two to three, and then it became zero-forty. After equalizing it, he still lost due to mistakes. Crawford advanced steadily and won again with six to two.</p>
<p>There is little to record in the fourth set. After Crawford won the first game, Farnes gradually regained his original state, full of vitality. His serve was heavy, and his volley was good, taking a big advantage. Crawford's mistakes were more than expected. He stood completely inside the defense line. At five to two, Farnes won another game of his own serve.</p>
<p>In the first four games of the fifth set, the servers all won with ease. After two each, Farnes' opportunity came. Due to Crawford's mistakes, Farnes took the lead again after equality and won by going to the net. In the next game, Farnes missed an extremely difficult air pressure ball. Crawford regained it with a fierce serve. At this time, the sunlight was gradually obscured by clouds, and the intensity gradually decreased. In the next game, Crawford won after being behind with thirty-forty, making it four to three. Farnes served three consecutive balls again, scoring three consecutive points, plus a volley, making the score equal again. Crawford was able to overcome the difficulties in two dangerous situations. Most people's opinions are inclined to Crawford's victory. Crawford did win his serve to make it five to four. When Farnes served, the first and second serves were both returned. Farnes followed suit, sending both serves into the net. Farnes was shocked and rushed to the net. Crawford made a wonderful volley, just hitting it past. It had become zero-forty. Farnes served incorrectly, served again, and Crawford hit it back. A great battle ended with Farnes touching the net again.</p>
<p>The King and Queen of England did not come, but the royal box was full. Former King Alfonso of Spain was the most eye-catching. In addition, there were ministers from various countries. After the final game, referee Brock sat at one end of the court, smoking a cigar, as if preparing for an accident.</p>
<p>Norna is not as good as Kram by far. Sato and Buijing performed excellently. After defeating Pan Laixius, this German team seemed to be unable to withstand a single blow. However, as a result of the competition, the first three sets were fiercely fought and very exciting. Norna shoots quickly, and his angled balls are very accurate. He wears a net, and as soon as he has a chance, he uses his racket. His weakness is that he is too eager to win, which causes many mistakes. If Kram can be more serious and have more confidence, Norna can be more effective. The two of them have created equal numbers of times in the first set, winning the second set, and the third set. Sato and Buijing have exhausted their brilliance.</p>
<p>James O and Mrs. Lee finally defeated them. The competition was held in the first match and was appreciated by the audience. James' group is even more for Ms. James. She is young, eager to win, and good at running, making the opponent tired of running around, winning the second set with a good disk, and winning the third set with four to four and six to four. Mrs. Geoffrey is still the most beautiful, and her hitting is remarkable. Mrs. Mickel's assistance is also very effective, but James and Yue's fierce pressure balls finally succumbed. This game was originally scheduled to be held in the central field, but was moved to the first field at 7:30. The competition was very interesting, and the audience left until 8:30.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pittman and Mrs. Litray are worth mentioning today. They lost in the first game against Mrs. Lanying and Madio in the central field, won the second set, and lost after a hard fight in the third set. Ms. Lanying and Mrs. Pittman are good at pressing the ball, while the other two are good at baseline shots. The presser guards in front of the net, preparing to hit hard, while Madio and Litray each make distant shots, sometimes adding high balls. This kind of hitting is very easy to feel monotonous, but with the right strategy, it is also very interesting. Ms. Lanying and Mrs. Madio still won as expected. The third set was six to four.</p>
<p>One special game in mixed doubles was Ms. Sheeran and Faguasheng defeating Ms. Nathoe and Boro Chula. When the losers performed the best, they were better than Hifa, but there were too many mistakes. Sheeran is the best, all with the air of the first player in England in 1932. Fagua and Boro Chula are similar, both eager to win, hit the ball too hard, and the mistakes also increase.</p>

<p>Foreign Ports</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education is About to Dissolve the Beiping Women's Liberal Arts College</h3>
<p>Secret Telegram to Principal Xu to First Expel Students Who Cause Trouble</p>
<p>Gu Cheng Issues Notices Daily Requiring Students to Submit Letters of Repentance</p>
<p>Students Send a Letter Asking Gao You Tang to Impeach President Gu</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The students of the Women's Liberal Arts College are opposing President Gu Cheng, sealing off the president's office, sending representatives to visit Supervisory Committee member Gao You Tang to request impeachment of Gu, and receiving department heads to ask for assistance. The Ministry of Education today sent another telegram to Beiping, stating that the student unrest at the Women's College must be dealt with severely. Details of the situation are described as follows:</p>
<p>(Ministry of Education Telegram to Xu) The Ministry of Education first telegraphed Xu Songming, the acting president of Beiping University, on Saturday, ordering a swift investigation into the student unrest at the Women's College and a detailed reply by telegram. President Xu immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Education, detailing the circumstances of the unrest. Today (the 26th), Minister of Education Wang Shijie sent a second urgent telegram to Xu Songming, the acting president of Beiping University, essentially stating that the student unrest at the Women's Liberal Arts College must be dealt with severely to rectify the academic atmosphere. If the students cause further trouble, they should be expelled. If necessary, the college can be dissolved. After receiving the telegram, Xu is considering the matter. The students sealing off the president's office in the Women's College is indeed inappropriate, as the president's office is not Gu Cheng's private property. However, President Gu also has instances of dereliction of duty and should be considered separately.</p>
<p>(Xu Investigates the Unrest) After receiving the second secret telegram from the Ministry of Education, President Xu first dispatched Yan Boming of the Academic Affairs Section to investigate administrative matters. After receiving the order, Yan spent the whole day investigating at the Women's College and obtained some material. At around 5:00 PM, President Xu also dispatched Lu Jiemin, the chief of the General Affairs Section, to investigate the situation from all angles. As of the time of submission, the investigation had not yet been completed.</p>
<p>(Gu Cheng's Notice) It has been found that a list of elected executive committee members and a list of representatives as published in newspapers have been posted within the college recently. Many people are listed, including Liu Fenlan, Cai Jinruo, Gu Guixian, Zhang Yinghan, Luo Shundian, Li Zhongyi, Guo Zuogan, Shi Yunshan, Wang Huizhi, Yin Yi, Li Duhua, Kong Xiuying, Zou Bulan, Li Jian, Zhu Zhengshan, Xiong Kai, Chen Cuihua, Zhang Shuxin, Xiong Ti, Zhao Zhongyu, Yang Guanghou, and You Shouhua. Their actions have been unusually transgressive. A severe punishment is necessary to maintain order. However, it is heard that some individuals do not wish to join, some have already resigned, and some have not yet taken office. A serious notice is hereby issued, limiting the above-mentioned individuals to declare in writing before 8:00 PM today that they have not joined this organization and must personally submit it to the Registration Office. Do not mistake yourself. This notice is from President Gu Cheng, the 25th.</p>
<p>(Second Notice) Liu Fanglan, Cai Jinruo, Gu Guixian, Zhang Yinghan, Li Zhongyi, Luo Shundian, Shi Yunshan, Yin Yi, Li Duhua, Zou Bulan, Li Jian, Xiong Kai, Chen Cuihua, Xiong Ti, Zhao Zhongyu, Yang Guanghou, and others have been engaging in transgressive behavior for days. A notice has been issued. Those who have not joined must declare it in writing. As of this afternoon, Guo Yougan, Kong Xiuying, and Zhu Zhengshan have sent letters stating that they have not joined. Wang Huizhi has also sent a letter stating that she disagrees with the views and has resigned from the Executive Committee. Apart from these, no one else has made any indication. This notice is issued for general knowledge. This notice is from President Gu Cheng, the 26th.</p>
<p>(Denying Repentance) After resigning from the Executive Committee of the Women's College, Ms. Wang Huizhi, a student representative, moved out of the dormitory today (the 26th). She made the following statement to reporters in the Western District: "This time, the students of the Women's College are opposing Gu. I resigned from the Executive Committee due to disagreement in work views. This did indeed happen. However, opposing Gu is a legitimate demand by all students in the college for freedom in choosing teachers. It is not something that any individual can control. I have no so-called fault, and there is no need for repentance. Evening newspapers reported that I submitted a letter of repentance, which is absolutely untrue."</p>
<p>(Police Stationed at the College) Since the students put up slogans, the situation at the Women's College has suddenly become tense. The work of the entire college has also become chaotic. For security reasons, President Gu specifically notified the Second District and the Public Security Bureau to dispatch police and motorcycle detectives to guard the college. They are strictly monitoring the actions of visitors, news reporters, and students. The department heads of the Women's College, because President Gu ambiguously passed motions in the college affairs meeting and arbitrarily used armed police to sit in the Women's College, believe that this is not only detrimental to appearances but will also cause the reputation to fall. Therefore, they have jointly reported to President Xu (Songming).</p>
<p>(Representatives Visit Gao) Student representatives Xiong Kai and Chen Cuihua took a letter to Gao's residence today (the 26th) to visit Supervisory Committee member Gao You Tang. The original letter is recorded below: "Respectable Mr. You Tang, The students are unfortunate to have suffered the unrest in our college. In the past ten days, the public has been uneasy. The students believe that Gu Cheng has always been base and dirty in his conduct and shallow in his knowledge. In the past, he used ghostly tricks to seize the position of president. After serving for a year, he has not only made no progress in college affairs but has also used the so-called tightening policy to destroy education. As for embezzling funds, hiring private individuals, smoking opium, and neglecting education, the facts are obvious, and we believe that you are already aware of them. For the sake of their own studies, the students were forced to ask Gu Cheng to resign voluntarily. Unexpectedly, he is shameless and uses his glib tongue to slander the students, claiming that they are acting out of line and causing trouble. Moreover, after you sent Ms. Yu Shaowen to the college to investigate, he felt even more ashamed and unable to face others, so he intensified his efforts to spread rumors and confuse the educational community's views. His behavior is despicable, disregarding public opinion and belittling supervisory officials, which can be imagined. The students deeply fear the deepening of the national crisis and are aware of the responsibilities of young people. They are willing to respect the government's intention to promote education and cultivate talents and to do their best to study and save the country. However, Gu Cheng has seized the Women's College, reversed course, and is only concerned with competition. He does not care about the students' studies. The facts are all there and can be reviewed one by one. In short, if Gu Cheng does not leave, the Women's College will be unable to enter the right track of education, and the students will be unable to study with peace of mind. In the past, the students repeatedly advised him, with the etiquette of students towards teachers, to retire and give way to the virtuous, but he remained ignorant and ignored them. Helplessly, they decided to go to Gu's residence to advise him in person. Unexpectedly, he neither repented nor resigned voluntarily but instead slandered the students, threatened them with police force. Thinking deeply about the principles of education, the emphasis is on influence, and the relationship between teachers and students should be based on respect and sincerity. Even if Gu Cheng treats the students as president, he is like a thug bullying the weak. The sacred educational community, the sacred women's higher education institution, allows such a scoundrel to exist. How can the future of education, the future of the Women's College, and the future of hundreds of young people be asked about? We have long admired your dignified appearance and extraordinary demeanor, and your impeachment of traitors is respected by all. The students admire your profound knowledge and have always admired you. Therefore, we dare to express our feelings frankly and respectfully ask you to fulfill your supervisory and impeachment responsibilities, to thoroughly investigate and impeach Gu Cheng, and to quickly send a telegram to the Supervisory Yuan to file an impeachment and submit it to the National Government, ordering the Ministry of Education to severely punish this degenerate in the educational community who smokes opium, embezzles educational funds, hires private individuals, bullies students, destroys education, and slanders young people. Then the Women's College will be renewed from now on, and the college affairs will be able to develop rapidly. In the future, if the students' academic achievements can be improved, it will be due to your gift. The students have publicly elected Shi Yunshan, Xiong Kai, Chen Cuihua, and other representatives to visit you and present the general situation in person. We sincerely hope that you will grant us an audience and give us guidance. We are very fortunate to pray. We are sincerely and urgently at your service. The students of the National Beiping University Women's Liberal Arts College bow respectfully."</p>
<h3>Comparison of Primary School Funding in Various Counties of Jiangsu in the Past Twenty Years</h3>
<p>The Joint Office for the Preparation of Compulsory Education in Jiangsu Province has compared the primary school funding of various counties from the first year of the Republic to the twentieth year of the Republic, and has made statistics. The main points are extracted below.</p>
<p>(1) In the first year of the Republic of China, the total primary school funding of the 61 counties in Jiangsu Province was 1,389,894 yuan. (2 to 4 omitted) In the fifth year, it was 1,910,744 yuan (an increase of 520,850 yuan compared to the first year). (6 to 9 omitted) In the tenth year, it was 2,504,999 yuan (an increase of 1,115,105 yuan compared to the first year, and an increase of 594,255 yuan compared to the fifth year). (11 to 14 omitted) In the fifteenth year, it was 2,605,954 yuan (an increase of 1,216,060 yuan compared to the first year, an increase of 695,210 yuan compared to the fifth year, and an increase of 100,955 yuan compared to the tenth year). (16 to 19 omitted) In the twentieth year, it was 4,422,168 yuan (an increase of 3,032,274 yuan compared to the first year, an increase of 2,511,424 yuan compared to the fifth year, an increase of 1,917,169 yuan compared to the tenth year, a decrease of 9,687 yuan compared to the nineteenth year).</p>
<p>(2) The total funding for each year only decreased in the fifteenth year due to military affairs compared to the fourteenth year, by 245,481 yuan. In the nineteenth year, it decreased due to the Financial Department's encroachment on local education funds compared to the eighteenth year, by 14,716 yuan. The rest of the years all increased compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>(3) Comparing the total amount of increased funding for each year, the 3rd, 6th, 10th, 12th, and 13th years did not reach the increase of their previous year. The largest increase was in the 18th year, at 115,528 yuan. Conversely, the smallest was in the 3rd year, at 44,383 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) Among the 20 years, only the 8th and 9th years had increases in funding for all counties without any decreases. In the other years, the increases and decreases in each county varied greatly, especially before the 16th year and in the 19th and 20th years.</p>
<p>(5) Among the 20 years, there were no counties with only increases or no decreases in funding. The maximum number of times funding was reduced was five, and the minimum was one. Among them, Jurong, Jinli, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Changshu, Rugao, Baoshan, Kunshan, Funing, Yancheng, and Dongtai counties had the fewest number of reductions.</p>
<p>(6) Comparing the funding of each county every five years, 10 counties decreased in the fifth year compared to the first year, 15 counties decreased in the tenth year compared to the fifth year, 17 counties decreased in the fifteenth year compared to the tenth year, and 7 counties decreased in the twentieth year compared to the fifteenth year.</p>
<p>(7) Although the total funding in the twentieth year increased by 3.23 times compared to the first year, analyzing and comparing the funding of each county shows that the twentieth year still had reductions compared to the first year. In addition to Shanghai's reduction of 33,056 yuan due to the division of the city, Gaoyou had a reduction of 11,666 yuan due to flooding, and Shi Ying had a reduction of 698 yuan due to flooding, totaling 45,420 yuan, exceeding the total amount of increased funding in the third year. Other counties such as Huaiyin, Yangzhong, Fengxian, Gaochun, and Dongtai only increased by 1,000 to 6,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(8) In the first year, 37 counties had funding of over 10,000 yuan (from Wujin at 94,510 yuan to Funing at 10,116 yuan). In the fifth year, 44 counties had over 10,000 yuan (from Shanghai at 190,750 yuan to Shuyang at 10,290 yuan). In the tenth year, 48 counties had over 10,000 yuan (from Shanghai at 337,498 yuan to Jingjiang at 12,155 yuan). In the fifteenth year, 50 counties had over 10,000 yuan (from Wuxi at 190,985 yuan to Jingjiang at 10,029 yuan). In the twentieth year, only Gaoyou (1,540 yuan) and Yangzhong (6,996 yuan) had funding reduced to less than 10,000 yuan due to flooding.</p>
<p>(9) Since the twentieth year, the smallest amount of funding for each county was Yangzhong's 500 yuan in the first year and Lishui's 521 yuan. The largest was Wuxian's 362,900 yuan in the eighteenth year. The difference between them is 725.8 times (the difference between Wujin, the county with the most funding in the first year, and Yangzhong is 109 times).</p>
<p>(10) Comparing the funding of each county between the twentieth year and the first year, the largest increase was Rugao's 166,996 yuan, an increase of five times. The smallest increase was Huaiyin's 6,350 yuan, an increase of one and a half times. The difference between the largest and smallest increases is 160,646 yuan.</p>
<h3>Statistics of Primary School Teachers and Children in Various Counties of Jiangsu in the Twenty-First Year</h3>
<p>19,122 Teachers</p>

The first lecture was held last night, with the legal scholar Zhang Shizhao as the main speaker. More than 300 teachers and students from the school attended.

<h3>The Ministry of Industry Adds Fishery Taxes, the Lake Society Will Discuss Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Farmers in Zhouleng Lake Town mostly rely on raising fish as their main occupation. Every year around Qingming, they raise capital to go to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to purchase fish fry and transport them back for feeding. Three years later, if they do not encounter fish plague or water and drought disasters, they can sell them at 　port. Even then, they may not obtain a pure profit of 10%. They are certainly not like the fishermen of Taihu Lake and the coast who can easily catch fish with nets and sell them on the market. However, the government treats fish ponds and farmland as the same category, and in recent years, it has added special construction donations and surcharges, with heavy payments. The general fish farmers are already in dire straits. Now, the Fisheries Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industry's Jiangzhe District, the Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office, and the Huzhou-Taihu-Suzhou Branch of the Jiangzhe District have issued notices and attached regulations and rules, notifying the fish trade that all fish sold must be collected and paid by the trade, with 1% collected per 100 yuan, and checkpoints set up in Leng Lake, Pingwang, and other places for inspection. The farmers in the town have petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry, considering the difficulties of the people, to exempt the fish produced from the ponds from taxes. They have also sent representatives to Shanghai to appeal to the various fellow villagers in Shanghai to help them. The Lake Society believes that this matter is of great importance to the rural economy and will be submitted to the Standing Committee meeting this Saturday to discuss rescue measures.</p>
<h3>National Medicine Industry Association Opposes Monopoly of Yunxiao Fritillaria Sales</h3>
<p>Petition to the Zhejiang Construction Bureau for Thorough Investigation and Prohibition</p>
<p>The National Medicine Industry Association of this city, due to the Yunxiao Fritillaria Transportation and Sales Cooperative of Yin County, under the guise of cooperation, centralized production, and then signed contracts with a few pharmacies, uniformly assigned exclusive sales, thus creating a situation of monopoly and manipulation. In recent months, prices have soared by more than double. If this is not prevented, there is likely to be continued increases. Moreover, the cooperative still has plans to eliminate seeds and suppress production. In the future, production will decrease daily, and when demand exceeds supply, they will hoard and demand exorbitant prices, allowing them to manipulate the situation at will. The future of the pharmaceutical industry is unimaginable, and it is also unkind to increase the burden on patients. Therefore, since the members' representatives' general meeting resolved to oppose it, the association's executive committee has planned and proceeded with all its might. It is said that its predetermined steps are roughly divided into three stages: (1) use private contact to wait for the other party to realize on their own and abandon the monopoly and manipulation methods; (2) if the other party is stubborn, then telegraph all provincial and municipal National Medicine Industry Associations to denounce them unanimously, and ask the National Medical Association to uphold justice, and notify members to sever ties with the monopoly and manipulation pharmacies first to promote their awakening; (3) petition the Zhejiang Construction Bureau for a thorough investigation and prohibition. Now that the association has given up hope that the other party will realize on its own, it is actively implementing the second and third methods to achieve its goal.</p>
<h3>Ye Jiaxing Suggests that the Public Works Department No Longer Interfere with Compensation Claims of Protected Households</h3>
<p>Forcibly Adding Pressure Will Inevitably Lead to the Expansion of Unrest</p>
<p>Ye Jiaxing, an executive member of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, believes that the compensation claims of protected households in the disaster area from insurance companies have been repeatedly interfered with by the police, and many people have been injured. He is deeply afraid that the unrest will expand and affect social stability. Yesterday, he specifically sent a letter to the Municipal Federation of the First Special District, asking it to send a letter to the Public Works Department, stating that it should no longer interfere with the compensation claims of protected households in the future to avoid the expansion of unrest, and hoping to persuade the foreign merchants' fire insurance association to find a solution as soon as possible. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, since the January 28th Incident, it has been one year and ten months. The losses suffered by the insured households in the war zone are countless. What they relied on for their daily lives has been reduced to ashes. Their situation is pitiful, and their experience is lamentable. If the insurance companies can consider their suffering and their own reputation, and accommodate compensation, there would be no disputes today. Now, the insured households claim compensation based on their insurance rights and obligations, which is justifiable. However, the company refuses to pay compensation on the grounds of pretexts, without any accommodating measures. It is no wonder that the insured households have urgent requests, so they sit down to demand compensation. Previously, it was heard that a certain company exerted its pressure, which aroused social criticism. Unexpectedly, there was another tragedy like that of the Tienshan Foreign Firm yesterday. The firm reported to the police and sent a large team of detectives to expel the insured households, which was like coercion, and even injured many people. At that time, the representatives of the insured households, Feng Qibiao, Zhang Ziming, Cai Tongshan, Lin Gen, Chen Zhaotang, etc., were sent to the hospital by car due to serious injuries. According to the insured households, they are claiming compensation for their own rightful rights, and the matter is not illegal. If the insurance industry can maintain a balanced mind and make some concessions to the original claims, it is not difficult to resolve. Why bother to report to the police and demean oneself? The police's expulsion of the insured households seems to be an excessive use of their authority. In my humble opinion, I deeply hope that the case can be resolved peacefully as soon as possible, otherwise, the stalemate will not be beneficial to both parties. After thinking again and again, I can only write to your association, asking you to quickly send a letter to the Public Works Department, stating that it should no longer add pressure to the compensation claims of the insured households to avoid the expansion of unrest, and hoping to persuade and guide the foreign merchants' fire insurance association to find a solution as soon as possible to avoid further complications and affect society." This is to inform you, and I hope you will consider it.</p>
<h3>Branches of the China Accounting School Established in Various Places</h3>
<p>The China Accounting Correspondence School at 1154 Xinzha Road, Shanghai, was founded by the famous accountant Mr. Shen Liren. It has been seven years now, and its achievements are remarkable. There are more than 2,000 students, spread all over the world. Overseas, such as Australia, Singapore, the Philippines, Annam, Burma, Siam, the South Pacific Islands.

Currently, those in the process of organizing include Hankou, Fujian, Guangzhou, and the Philippines, among others. It is also heard that most students intend to invite the school principal, Mr. Shen Liren, to travel to various places to give lectures, so as to receive face-to-face instruction and comfort their admiration. It is said that Mr. Shen finds it difficult to travel at the moment due to busy business, but the perfection of the school's management and the trust of the students can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Organ for Trafficking in Persons Broken Up on Ma Huo Road</h3>
<p>Wang Yufu, a Beast, Actually Raped His Concubine's Daughter</p>
<p>Gen Di, the 14-year-old daughter of Jin Yao, a woman from Yancheng who lives at No. 12 Tong'an Lane, Meiyuan Road, Zhabei, went out to buy things at around 8 a.m. on the 23rd of last month, but never returned. She searched everywhere, but there was no news. Until the day before yesterday, Bao Shuji, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, learned that there were kidnappers hiding at No. 6 Ma Huo Road, specializing in trafficking in persons for profit, and Gen Di was also kidnapped. Therefore, he went there with a Western detective and arrested Wang Yufu (41 years old, from Anhui Province), Chen Kong (46 years old, from Zhenjiang, Wang's concubine), and rescued the abducted girls Jin Gen Di and Xu Guiying from Yangzhou, as well as Chen Kong's daughter, Chen Lin Di, and brought them all to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the District Court of the First Special District, where Judge Liu Yugui conducted the interrogation. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the Police Station stated that the abducted Jin Gen Di is now being claimed by her mother who came to the court. The family members of Xu Guiying are in Yangzhou, please send her to the Women and Children Relief Association for claim. Chen Lin Di is Chen Kong's biological daughter. Although the defendant Wang Yufu is also her father, he dared to force and rape the girl when she was 13 years old when Chen Kong returned to her hometown, satisfying his animalistic desires. Since December of last year, Wang resumed the rape with the same methods when Ms. Chen returned to her hometown again. The girl was already pregnant and gave birth at the beginning of this month. The child was a boy, but he was only seven months pregnant, resulting in a weak fetus and death. The girl Chen's body has not yet recovered and should be sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. This case should be adjourned, etc. Subsequently, according to Jin Yao's proof of the circumstances of her daughter Gen Di's disappearance, she requested to claim her. According to the girl Xu Guiying's confession, she called Chen Kong "aunt" and her home was in the Fairy Temple area of Yangzhou. Recently, she was accompanied by her mother to Shanghai and stayed at Chen Kong's place, helping with operations every day, buying vegetables, washing clothes, and serving her sister Chen Lin Di, etc. The girl Chen has a beautiful appearance and a weak body. If she has a disease, her hair is cut short and she is wearing a cheongsam, and she was summoned to the case. She spoke eloquently, referring to the defendant Wang Yufu as her father, and said that Wang Yufu did indeed rape her several times two years ago and in the winter of last year when her mother (i.e., Chen Kong) returned to her hometown, but she was unwilling. She has only given birth for sixteen days. The court asked her if she had slept with anyone else, and she replied only with her father. When asked, the defendant Wang Yufu denied raping the girl. Judge Liu ordered the defendants to be remanded separately and adjourned the hearing to investigate and clarify. The girl Chen Lin Di was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Jin Gen Di was claimed by her mother Jin Yao. Xu Guiying was handed over to the Women and Children Relief Association for foster care.</p>
<h3>Russian Youth Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Currently a Typist at a Russian Newspaper</p>
<p>The Youth's Name is Li Ke Si Duo Ding</p>
<p>A Russian youth, Li Ke Si Duo Ding, 22 years old, is currently a typist at a Russian newspaper on Xiafei Road. He lived in Tuo Si Tuo La Fu Lane, Rue de la Sainte Vierge, in the French Concession (translated as a place where Russian expatriates live). Last night, around 8 o'clock, the youth, for some unknown reason, suddenly had the thought of committing suicide. He took advantage of people's unpreparedness and secretly used a rifle, tying a rope to the gun trigger and kicking it with his foot. With a loud bang, the bullet entered his chest and pierced his back, and he fell to the ground and died. When people heard the sound and rushed to check, it was already too late. Someone reported it to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate the scene. The court will be notified for inspection.</p>
<h3>Second Special Court Replaces New Badges</h3>
<p>The silver round badges with a white sun in a blue sky that were previously worn by the staff of the Second Special District Court of Shanghai have been discarded because they have been around for a long time and are often lost. A new type of badge has been made, which is still silver and round, but the pattern has been changed to a white sun in a blue sky shining on a mythical beast, symbolizing the meaning of distinguishing right from wrong. The back is engraved with French and numbers. It has been distributed to all employees in office a few days ago, and it will be worn on the first day of next month for identification.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhihan Accused of Occupying Property</h3>
<p>Chen Jiayou, a local resident currently living at No. 1, Sungili, Rue de la Sainte Vierge, in the French Concession, is 56 years old and has two sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Zhihan, and the second daughter, Zhicheng, were born to his legal wife, Zhang. His concubine, Zhang, also gave birth to a son named Zhiqin and a daughter named Zhiying. Chen is a Catholic and a relative of Chen Shenxing, a well-known wealthy businessman in Shanghai. His late father was called "Third Old Man" by the people and left behind hundreds of thousands of assets. Chen was the only son, and all the assets were in his control. Later, because Chen had hobbies, did not engage in production, and went wild in prostitution and gambling outside, he lived separately from his mother, wife, and concubine, and gradually sold or mortgaged the property for use. His mother, Jin, was worried about this. Chen was unscrupulous outside, and she was afraid that the property would be squandered, and that his daughter-in-law and grandchildren would have nothing to live on in the future. Therefore, Jin came forward and filed a complaint with the former French Public Concession to issue an order declaring Chen Jiayou to be prohibited from managing property. All remaining assets were transferred to his daughter-in-law and grandchildren for management as a basis for future life. Later, Jiayou took his concubine and illegitimate children to Hanzhong. His mother, Jin, passed away soon after, and his eldest son, Zhihan, came of age, managed the property, and moved to 23 Qingpingfang, Lakena Road, with his mother, Zhang. Over the years, he developed his business and accumulated capital to establish the Weida Foreign Firm and the Weida Hotel on Lafitte Road (Weida is Zhihan's name). Three years ago, Jiayou returned to Shanghai and ordered his son to hand over the property, which he refused. He also filed a lawsuit in the French Public Concession (Chen's family disputes had been handled by the Public Concession many times). Through mediation, Zhihan subsidized his father with living expenses of 70 yuan per month. Jiayou felt that this was not enough, so he filed a petition with the Second Special District Court last year to mediate an increase, and another 5 yuan was added, bringing it to 75 yuan per month. Now that his illegitimate children, Zhiqin and Zhiying, have come of age, they asked Zhihan to hand over the property for distribution, but they were unsuccessful. In early summer, they filed a petition with the Second Special Court to mediate the distribution, but it was unsuccessful. Recently, they hired a lawyer to formally file a civil lawsuit with the court, accusing his brother Zhihan of occupying the property and requesting distribution according to law. The court, based on the complaint, tried the case in the Sixth Civil Division yesterday morning by Judge Chu Shenjie. The plaintiff, Chen Zhiqin, arrived in court with his mother, Zhang, and his lawyer, stating the previous situation. The defendant, Zhihan, also hired a lawyer to appear in court and defend, saying that all the property had been divided by his grandmother in the past, and presented the order issued by the Public Concession, denying that he had occupied his father's property. After verifying the statements in court, he ordered the plaintiff to submit a list of assets for the record and adjourned the hearing to 10:00 a.m. on October 8.</p>

<h3>Chen Fugui Attempts Suicide Due to Poverty</h3>
<p>Chen Fugui, a native of Shaoxing, 27 years old, used to be in the used goods business, but now he is unemployed and in economic hardship. On the 24th, he went alone to the Xin Hotel in Ziyoufang, Wuma Road, room number eight, the room rate is six corners per day. In the afternoon the day before yesterday, he went out of the hotel, and returned for rest only at dawn (the 26th) the next morning. When he went to bed, he said to the waiter, "I am tired, I should sleep more to recuperate. Please wake me up before two or three in the afternoon," etc. When the time came, the waiter knocked on the door of room number eight several times, but there was no sound. He tried to pry open the door and went in to check. He saw Chen lying stiffly on the bed, unconscious. He also found two empty bottles of sleeping pills on the table. He suspected that he had taken poison. He immediately called his uncle to come and accompany him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that he took too much poison and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Possession of a Gun Without a License</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Received a Report and Went to Arrest Him</p>
<p>Tong Hui, a local man who was a successful candidate in the imperial examinations of the Qing Dynasty, was an advanced revolutionary of the Tongmenghui. He built a mansion at No. 249 Fumin Road, South Gate, Nanshi. The well-known large-scale Gongmao Timber Company in this city is operated by Tong. Tong passed away three years ago, leaving behind his elderly wife, Wang, and his eldest son, Tong Tongbao, who is now 51 years old. He inherited his father's business and presided over Gongmao's affairs. However, he was quite active on weekdays. When the revolutionary army arrived in Shanghai in 1927, he also participated in military work. At that time, he had a pistol. Later, Tongbao hid the gun at home and sometimes wore it on his body for self-defense. However, he did not have a license. Unexpectedly, someone recently informed the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Director Wen, upon hearing the report, ordered Inspector Zhong to lead the police chief of the Third Division of the First District to Gongmao Timber Company around 8 o'clock the night before last and searched Tong's bedroom. They found the pistol under the pillow and seized 17 bullets. They brought everything to the station and interrogated him for not having a license. At 10 o'clock that night, he prepared a document to submit to the Judicial Section for verification.</p>

<p>Shen Zhenhua, the chief of the First Branch of the Second District, recently received a secret report that someone was secretly setting up a large opium den at No. 1 Renzhili, Jiomu Di, for people to smoke for profit. Chief Shen specifically sent Inspector Hong and police chief Gao Yin, as well as police officers, disguised, to go to the site at 7 o'clock last night, and arrested the second landlord, Zhang Zhenhua, the opium den owner, Wu Amu, and 29 opium smokers and others. They also seized six opium pipes, seven opium lamps, ashtrays, opium paste, and opium scrapers. All were arrested and investigated. According to Wu Amu's confession, Chief Shen admitted to privately setting up an opium den for people to smoke, and confessed that the house was leased by the second landlord, Zhang Zhenhua, in partnership for common profit. When Zhang Zhenhua was interrogated, he said that he did not know that Wu Amu had opened an opium den in the house rented by Wu Amu, and that he had not partnered with Wu Amu. He was actually framed. The interrogator asked how could he not know that dozens of people were entering and leaving the house, which was obviously a lie. It was sentenced to be handed over to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Fellow Association Held Regular Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Relief Committee for the Sichuan Northern Famine of the Shanghai Sichuan Fellow Association convened a regular meeting at the association yesterday to discuss the invitation of various charitable organizations and philanthropists in this city. All members of the Standing Committee attended. First, Qiu Zhizhong, who is also the head of the document group, reported on the recent work situation. He also reported that He Baoheng and other representatives of the Famine Petition Group told him that Dai Jitao, Shi Qingyang, Lu Hanqun, Sun Yuanliang, and other famous Sichuanese in Beijing had personally instructed him to inform the Sichuan Famine Association of the Shanghai Fellow Association and to notify them of the exact date of inviting various charitable organizations and philanthropists in Shanghai in advance, and that they would be present on time, etc. Then, the discussion began and the following major cases were discussed and decided: (1) It was decided to invite various charitable organizations and philanthropists in this city at Jiaolin, Xiafei Road, at noon next Sunday (October 7); (2) Mr. Dai Jitao and other well-known Sichuanese in Beijing are concerned about the suffering of their hometown and are willing to personally come to Shanghai to appeal for righteous relief for the victims. It is very fortunate. In addition to sending a letter in advance, Li Qingfan was also assigned to go to Beijing to meet and greet them at that time; (3) The charitable organizations and philanthropists who had previously sent letters requesting assistance should be bundled and sent out as soon as possible, and a detailed investigation should be carried out to avoid omissions, so as to facilitate invitations to banquets; (4) Notify the committee members of this association, Yang Cangbai and Huang Fusheng, to attend and accompany them at that time; (5) Since the government is willing to allocate funds for the Sichuan famine relief, a telegram can be sent again to urge the prompt release so that the suffering of hundreds of refugees waiting to be fed can be relieved as soon as possible.</p>

Since its establishment less than a year ago, it has gained the trust of society with its genuine and fairly priced fuels, leading to rapid business growth.

<p>The Glory of Shuanglong Brand Yarn: The Rise of a Giant in Domestic Woolen Yarn. The Shuanglong brand domestic woolen yarn produced by Zhenxing Textile Factory boasts excellent quality and low prices. Since its launch, it has been highly praised. The factory participated in the 4th National Goods Movement Fair last year, and for the purpose of promoting the beauty of domestic production, it pioneered a massive sacrifice of giving away half a pound for every pound purchased. As a result, domestic Shuanglong woolen yarn has become popular in general society, and its contribution to resisting imported goods is undeniable. Recently, Mayor Wu of this city presented a certificate of excellence as an encouragement. Since autumn, orders from other ports, such as Hong Kong, Shantou, Chongqing, Changsha, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Tianjin, Peiping, and Hankou, have been pouring in, creating a situation where they are unable to keep up with demand. It is heard that the factory, in order to uphold the government's encouragement and the enthusiasm of compatriots' love, will maintain its past sales price.

<h3>Ten Factory Owners Infringe on Domestic Goods by Fraudulently Passing Off Japanese Yarn: Their Conscience is Utterly Extinguished</h3>
<p>Knowing They Can't Escape Major Legal Responsibility</p>
<p>竭力向申新方面請求和解</p>
<p>竭力向申新方面請求和解</p>
<p>Diligently Begging Xin Xin for Reconciliation</p>
<p>-The First Special Court to Retry this Case Tomorrow-</p>
<p>工足襪廠·三陽棉織廠·久益織廠·昇新布廠·裕東襪廠·均昌織廠·澐洲染織廠·永源絲光廠·義興號·通和染織廠·工足襪廠·三陽棉織廠·久益織廠·昇新布廠·裕東襪廠·均昌織廠·澐洲染織廠·永源絲光廠·義興號·通和染織廠·</p>
<p>Gongzu Socks Factory, Sanyang Cotton Weaving Factory, Jiuyi Weaving Factory, Shengxin Cloth Factory, Yudong Socks Factory, Junchang Weaving Factory, Yunzhou Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Yongyuan Mercerizing Factory, Yixing Store, and Tonghe Dyeing and Weaving Factory, these ten factories privately imported large quantities of Japanese raw materials. Before the finished products were produced, they falsified the tax certificate of the Lima brand of the Japanese-owned Dakang Yarn Factory as the Zhong brand of the Shenxin No. 5 Factory, hoping to confuse it and report it to the Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Unified Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance for transport. The incident was discovered by the bureau, which immediately notified the Shenxin No. 5 Factory to send personnel to jointly investigate and verify the facts. Since the matter involved falsifying documents and infringing on the trademark use of the Shenxin company, Rong Weiren, the manager of the No. 5 Factory, hired lawyer Sun Zuji to represent the company and submitted a criminal self-accusation to the First Special Court against the managers of the ten factories, Yu Xifan, Chen Zhongxian, Wang Liwei, Sun Xizu, Yu Yuxin, Zhou Songmao, Chai Zhixiang, Zhao Bingnan, Wang Gensheng, Guan Bingqing, etc., requesting that they be punished according to law, and demanding compensation for losses of 200,000 yuan. The First Special Court approved the petition and appointed Judge Liu Yugui to publicly hear the case on the 19th. At that time, none of the defendants appeared in court, so only the plaintiff's lawyer stated the intention of the lawsuit. Later, Judge Liu announced that the hearing would be postponed for ten days. This newspaper has already reported on the situation. It is now heard that during the past few days of postponement, the defendants knew that the facts were certain and could not be escaped. In order to avoid legal disputes, they have been asking people to reconcile with Shenxin in recent days. Shenxin did not comment on this. It is heard that the ten factories hoped that after Shenxin accepted the reconciliation conditions, Shenxin would withdraw the self-accusation from the court. The ten factories are willing to compensate for the losses suffered by Shenxin and sign a contract. In the future, all the newly produced yarn of the Shenxin Nos. 9 and 5 Factories every day (averaging more than 50 pieces per day, 40 packs per piece, with each piece worth about 200 taels in national currency) will be purchased by the ten factories. Tomorrow (the 29th) is the date for the retrial of this case. Whether the reconciliation between the two parties can be established depends entirely on whether the self-accusation is withdrawn. However, according to news from lawyer Sun Zuji, he firmly stated that he was completely unaware of the reconciliation and was preparing for the retrial.</p>
<h3>Subsequent New Buildings in Concessions Should Raise Foundations</h3>
<p>In View of the Damage Caused by the Last Storm</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the places where the floodwaters from the Huangpu River rose deepest the other day were all near large buildings, such as near the Jianghai Customs and the HSBC Bank on the Bund, around the Municipal Council on Jiangxi Road, and near the Sincere and Wing On Companies on Nanjing Road. In each of these places, the water could be more than knee-deep. Yesterday, someone raised the issue with the staff of the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council, saying that the subsidence of these places was due to the excessive pressure from large buildings. However, the staff of the Public Works Department said that these places were originally low-lying areas 30 years ago, and there are still many places that are equally low-lying even now that do not have large buildings. The subsidence of large buildings will inevitably make the terrain even lower, but with the progress of pile-driving knowledge nowadays, new large buildings will not subside as much as those built in the past. Therefore, large-scale construction in the future will not make this city more prone to flooding. In addition, some people believe that the extraction of accumulated water from the ground by the majority of artesian wells will easily cause the strata to subside. However, one expert opposed this view, saying that, according to his impression, the terrain of this city has slightly risen over the years. He also recalled that during the hurricane tide on September 1, 1905, the water on the Bund was so deep that a sampan was blown into the central area of ​​the Public Concession. Although the tide water does not damage the foundations of houses in a short time, in order to avoid various inconveniences, the foundations of new buildings should be raised in the future to make the terrain lower, and each road can be gradually filled in.</p>
<h3>Bidding Companies Hoping to Deceive the Railway Bureau</h3>
<p>Red Rooster Brand Bleached Cloth is Definitely Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The Cotton Cloth Association Has Sent a Letter to Prove It</p>
<p>He Ping She (Peace Society) said that the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus once invited businesses to bid for the material for the tablecloths for passenger cars. Recently, a certain business in this city won the bid. According to a tip-off, the cloth submitted by the business was Japanese goods. Huang Boqiao, the director of the bureau, in order to clarify the truth, sent a sample piece of cloth to the Cotton Cloth Association in this city for inspection. The association said that the Red Rooster brand bleached cloth was definitely Japanese goods, but the original sample was too small to be identified. They requested that the original whole piece of cloth be sent for careful identification. The business knew that it was difficult to hide the matter from the bureau's thorough investigation, so it sent the Gold Tiger brand British cloth sold by the British-owned Tahe Foreign Firm to the association for identification. As a result, the confusing case of swapping British and Japanese cloth was revealed. Now, the reporter from He Ping She has excerpted the letters from both parties as follows:</p>
<h3>Letter from the Railway Bureau</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus wrote to the Cotton Cloth Association, saying that the bureau has tendered for the material of passenger car tablecloths, and a certain business in this city has won the bid. However, it is said that the cloth submitted by the business is the Red Rooster brand of Japanese goods sold by the Aipei Foreign Firm. In order to investigate and clarify, please give your identification to make it easy to distinguish. A sample piece of the above material is enclosed for your reply. The bureau also continued to write that it had received a letter from you saying that the previously sent sample was too small and asked to replace it with the original whole piece for easy identification, etc. I have ordered the original business to submit a piece of Gold Tiger brand sample cloth. Whether the sample cloth is the same as the small sample cloth previously sent, and whether the Gold Tiger brand is Japanese goods, please give your identification to use as a basis for verification. Enclosed is a piece of the small sample cloth previously sent, and a piece of Gold Tiger brand sample cloth, for your reply.</p>
<h3>Reply from the Cotton Industry</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Received your letter and attached a sample of cloth, asking us to give you our identification and reply, etc. Our association has found the sample to be suspicious. However, it is difficult to identify because the original sample is too small. We would like to ask your bureau to order the bidding business to submit the original whole piece. If it turns out to be the Red Rooster brand sold by the Aipei Foreign Firm, then it is definitely Japanese goods. Otherwise, after a comparison, it is not difficult to find out the truth. The association also continued to write that it had received a letter from you, and attached a piece of Gold Tiger brand bleached cloth, and a small sample, asking us to identify whether they match, and whether the Gold Tiger brand is Japanese goods, etc. According to this, after investigation, the Gold Tiger brand bleached cloth is indeed produced by the British-owned Tahe Foreign Firm and is not Japanese goods. However, compared with the small sample previously sent, the quality, color, and raw materials are all completely different. The original large sample is returned with this letter.</p>
<h3>The Yangtze River Shipping is Gradually Picking Up</h3>
<p>Both Japanese Goods Entering and Exiting are Crowded</p>
<p>Discussion on Resuming Suspended Yangtze River Steamers</p>
<p>This year, the Yangtze River shipping has been the most sluggish. Last month, the six companies in Shanghai reduced their ships due to a sharp drop in business, causing China Merchants, Sanbei, Taigu, and Yihe to simultaneously suspend shifts in order to reduce losses. Recently, the import of inferior goods on the Yangtze River and the export of domestic Chinese raw materials to Japan have improved day by day, and the transit goods from various places and the goods from this street transported to the Yangtze River have also improved slightly compared with the previous two months. The ships that have been suspended by various companies are now being considered for resumption. The recent situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>General Situation of Entering and Exiting Goods</h3>
<p>From January to the end of August this year, the total value of imported goods in various ports along the Yangtze River (excluding the Shanghai port) was 51,289,000 yuan, a decrease of 9,629,000 yuan compared with the same period last year. As for exports, in these eight months, due to the congestion of goods shipped to Japan, the total value was 36,740,000 yuan, an increase of 7,472,000 yuan compared with the same period last year.</p>
<h3>Inferior Goods are Gradually Increasing</h3>
<p>Inferior goods on the Yangtze River have gradually increased in these two months. Recently, every ship of the Japanese Post Office Company that arrives in Shanghai from Japan has 300 to 400 tons transferred to Hankou and other ports, mostly marine products, Japanese sugar, Asian cotton textiles, paper, and groceries. These goods are all transferred by Nisshin Yangtze River steamers. The Near Seas Company has also sent Japanese direct-release ships to the Yangtze River. As for the transport of Chinese goods to Japan, the congestion is unprecedented. Even the tonnage for loading must be agreed upon in advance. If you go to load temporarily, you will not be able to meet the demand. The most common goods are bran and miscellaneous grains. In addition to the seven ships of the Japanese Post Office Company that specialize in sailing, Mitsui and Showa all have Yangtze River-Japan liners operating.</p>
<h3>The Revival of Shanghai-Hankou Goods</h3>
<p>Since this month, the Yangtze River liners of the six companies, after the previous consultation and rectification, have unified the water fee and exchanged the cargo manifests of each ship in order to eliminate the irregular release of rebates due to mutual competition. The import and export business is gradually on track, and the irregular release of commissions of nine and five points has also been eliminated. Recently, the Yangtze River ships of Taigu and Yihe have seen an increase in transshipment cargo, which is better than the previous two months. Each ship can maintain its expenses without losses. The goods transported from this street by the China Merchants Bureau this year are uniquely good. Almost every ship can be fully loaded. Recently, there has been a shortage of ships due to the large amount of goods, and there is a trend of insufficient demand. It is planned to purchase the Lianhe ship from Yihe to expand, but the deal has not been realized due to the unsuitable ship price. After Shen Zhongyi took charge of the Yangtze River ships of Sanbei, the business has also been very strong. Currently, the goods transported can be increased by an average of more than 20% compared with the previous two months, and the business is gradually showing signs of revival.</p>
<h3>Resumption of Various Merchant Ships</h3>
<p>Taigu, Yihe, China Merchants, Sanbei, etc., suspended ships in the previous month due to sluggish business. Now, due to the gradual launch of import and export passengers and cargo, various companies have held another meeting. At that time, there were more ships than goods and the ships were suspended. However, after the companies reduced their shifts, general wild chicken ships took this opportunity to add sailings to the Yangtze River to replace the empty shifts of the companies' reduced shifts. This made the freight rates plummet, so that those who stopped the ships did not get the effect of reducing shifts, but instead created the opportunity for the wild chicken ships to start running the Yangtze River liners. Therefore, instead of uselessly suspending for a long time, it is better to resume sailing, and you can recover a part of the business that was taken away. This matter is under discussion, and it is expected that the ships that were previously suspended will resume sailing soon.</p>
<h3>Fire Hydrants Installed in the City Center</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Drafts a Plan</p>
<p>Submitted to the Municipal Government for Approval</p>
<p>The water supply problem in the city center has been solved. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company has laid water pipes in Sanmin Road, Fubei Neilu, and Guohe Road. However, the fire hydrant is necessary for street cleaning and fire protection. In view of this, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has sent a member to conduct a detailed survey of Sanmin Road and other places together with the Zhabei Fire Brigade, and to plan in detail on the important trunk roads where water pipes are buried. The first phase plans to install 19 fire hydrants. It is heard that this plan has been submitted by the bureau to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<h3>Elder Brother is Salt Police District Chief, Younger Brother is Famous Salt Smuggler</h3>
<p>Smuggler Brother Invades Zhangyan and Shoots Policeman</p>
<p>Police Brother is Suspected of Colluding in the Crime</p>
<p>Pan Baozhong, a native of Fengxian, is a well-known salt police district chief. However, his younger brother, Pan Jusheng, is a famous salt smuggler, and Jia Baofeng, the captain under Pan's command, is also a salt smuggler. In April, Pan Jusheng led a large number of salt smugglers, sailing dozens of boats through Zhangyan, and clashed with the salt police. As a result, the salt boats escaped, and two salt police officers were shot and killed. After the incident, due to the seriousness of the circumstances, it was transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation. People involved in the case also implicated Pan Baozhong in colluding with his younger brother to commit malfeasance and take the opportunity to kill the salt police officers. The prosecutor investigated Pan Zhongbao's criminal conduct and found him highly suspicious, so he filed a public prosecution according to law. After repeated interrogations by the criminal court, Judge Guan continued the trial yesterday, and Pan Baozhong did not present any evidence to the contrary, and the circumstances were clearly visible. Xun Zhi, Pan's confession, said that his younger brother had behaved improperly, and he had already held official positions, so he had long declared that he had severed ties with him. He also knew that his younger brother had a large number of salt boats passing through the border, so he ordered Captain Jia Baofeng to lead patrol boats to block them, but they were led into the river. He then sent patrol boats to intercept them, resulting in a battle in which police officers were injured and killed. Jia Baofeng fled without a trace, and it was later learned that he was in Shanghai, so he came to arrest him, but he was falsely accused. The investigating officer verified the confession and asked where he was at the time of the interrogation. He replied that he had received a call from the district office in the countryside, saying that Pan Jusheng had a salt boat passing through. However, Pan Baozhong could not provide any witnesses, which he considered to be empty words, and the case was serious, so he ordered him to be detained and not allowed to be bailed, pending further summons for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Three Cantonese Women Deceived into Prostitution in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Kind-hearted Patron Mai Weiwen Rescues Them</p>
<p>Pimp and Paramour Each Sentenced to One Year</p>
<p>－The Three Women Await Letters for Their Families to Reclaim Them－</p>
<p>Cantonese women Luo Yueqing, 20 years old; Liang Zhi, 24 years old; and Li Mei, 19 years old, were all factory workers at the Limin Xing Sock Factory in Kowloon, Hong Kong. Their income was meager and their looks were ordinary. However, a fellow villager, a woman named Zeng Luo, who had also worked in the factory, knew the three women. This woman was quite wicked, and seeing that the three women were young and easily deceived, she falsely claimed to them that Shanghai was full of factories with high wages. She said that a textile factory was asking her to recruit female workers, with a monthly salary of twenty yuan, and that they could go to Shanghai with her to work for six months, and so on. The three women were overjoyed and told their families, and on August 12th, Luo, Liang, and Li, along with Zeng Luo and her Cantonese paramour Liu Guang, took a steamer to Shanghai. They first stayed in an inn for two nights, and then resided at No. 15 Changan Lane, Wusong Road, where they were made to knit wool for others to make a living. On September 17th, Liu Guang rented No. 606 Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road, and opened a Cantonese brothel with Zeng Luo. All the capital was paid by Liu. He then forced the three women to give up their knitting work and take on the sole task of receiving guests. He strictly instructed the three women not to refuse any obscene behavior from patrons. The three women initially refused, which led to them being whipped and starved, causing them unspeakable suffering. Under the pressure, the three women were unable to resist and had to endure the humiliation of receiving guests, but they were unwilling. They wanted to find a chance to escape, but the pair's guard was tight, making it impossible for them to take a single step beyond the confines. One night, Mai Weiwen, an official of the Cantonese Joint Assembly, went to No. 606 Renzhi Lane with several companions. They met the three women, who told Mai all about their experiences and begged him to find a way to report them to the police so that they could escape from the fiery pit. Mai saw that the three women were pitiful, and he felt it was his duty to help. He went out and reported the case to Chinese Constable No. 1294 and Detective Bao Fucheng, who came and took Zeng Luo, Liu Guang, and the three women, Luo Yueqing, to the Hongkou Police Station for separate detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Jiang Baolian, a lawyer from the police station, presented the above situation, saying that Zeng Luo and Liu Guang were being prosecuted for violating public morals under Article 246 of the Criminal Law, and requested that they be punished according to the law. Luo Yueqing, Li Mei, and Liang Zhi also filed a complaint, stating that the defendants had lured them to Shanghai and forced them to receive guests. If they were slightly unwilling, they would be beaten. They had received guests twice, and all the money they earned was taken away by Zeng Luo, and they received nothing. They were also starved for two days. It was not until yesterday that they wept to the patron Mai Weiwen and begged for help, and they were able to escape from the sea of suffering. They now requested that they be helped to return to their hometown, and so on. Mai Weiwen also testified to everything. When questioned, Zeng Luo denied forcing them into prostitution, saying that it was all of their own free will. She directly admitted to the other details. Liu Guang stated that Luo Yueqing and others volunteered to be prostitutes and asked him to advance money to open a brothel, and now they were demanding that he be compensated for the more than two hundred yuan he had advanced, and so on. After verifying the statements, Judge Deng Baosun ruled that Zeng Luo and Liu Guang had jointly intended to make a profit by inducing virtuous women to commit adultery with others, and each was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Luo Yueqing, Liang Zhi, and Li Mei were temporarily sent to the Women and Children's Relief Association for shelter, pending notification of their families to come to Shanghai to claim them.</p>

<h3>Tax Bureau Invites Cigarette Manufacturers</h3>
<p>Director Xie Holds a Discussion Meeting to Express Opinions</p>
<p>The Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance held a tea party at the Dongya Restaurant at 2:00 PM on the 27th of this month, inviting Chinese and foreign cigarette manufacturers. Representatives from dozens of companies, including Nanyang, Huacheng, British-American Tobacco, and Damei, attended. Director Xie expressed his opinions on the spot, stating that the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Association has been working hard and has achieved great results in recent years. He briefly mentioned the following: (1) Guiding business operations, such as cigarette trademarks. In the past, there were many imitations. After the association requested a deadline for registration, it was used as a fundamental solution. Now, disputes over fake brands have been reduced one after another, which has had a good effect. (2) Maintaining legitimate interests, such as the heavy taxation in various provinces. Last year, there were quite a few cases, which were canceled one by one through the concerted efforts of the association and the tax bureau, safeguarding the interests of the industry, which was not a small achievement. (3) Correcting unfair competition, such as banning the sale of loose cigarettes in paper boxes of fifty and one hundred, and advising the industry to adopt legitimate procedures for business operations and to stop issuing lottery tickets. (4) Cracking down on privately manufactured cigarette factories. The association has been able to report private manufacturing situations in various places at any time, and the tax bureau has forwarded the information, and many have been seized. These few points are enough to show the achievements. Now, for the sake of national tax revenue and the business of cigarette factories, the director of this bureau hopes that the association will continue to work hard in the following ways: 1. In this era of economic depression, the Cigarette Association should lead the industry and stand on the same front as the tax bureau to cooperate fully. 2. Cigarette manufacturers are most certain in differentiating between private manufacturing and counterfeit brands. In the future, each cigarette factory should be responsible for reporting private manufacturing situations at any time so that they can be seized and punished. 3. The association and the business committee that is being organized should do their best to study specific prevention measures for cigarette smuggling, counterfeiting, and new manufacturing, so that the tax bureau can adopt and implement them, or the tax bureau can send personnel to work with the personnel sent by the association to handle them at any time. 4. If the unified tax authorities in various provinces are not effective in cracking down on smuggling or shirk their responsibilities, each manufacturer can report the facts. 5. The association should be responsible for studying whether there is private selling of cigarette paper and whether there are false import applications in the name of other types of paper, and report them to the tax bureau at any time. 6. Although each member of the association has its own sales methods, it is important not to undercut each other, which will lead to mutual losses. In short, officials and businessmen should cooperate effectively, which will be beneficial to both national taxes and business operations. If any cigarette manufacturer has anything to report to the tax bureau, they are welcome to report it at any time or come to the bureau to discuss it. Although the director of this bureau is in a government office, he does not want to have complicated formalities that make cigarette manufacturers feel inconvenient. As soon as a report is received, it will be verified. As for the recent rumors of tax increases, they are unfounded. In this autumn of commercial depression, it is impossible to increase taxes again to burden cigarette manufacturers. Even in terms of tax revenue, if business is developed, tax revenue will naturally increase. Otherwise, even if the tax rate is increased, business will decline, which will not only not help tax revenue but also burden cigarette manufacturers. Then, Mr. Wu Tingsheng, a representative of the cigarette manufacturers, gave a speech of thanks, saying that since Director Xie took office, he has been very concerned about the business of cigarette manufacturers, and he has been able to cooperate sincerely with the Cigarette Factory Association, which has gradually put our industry on track. In terms of investigating and cracking down on smuggled cigarettes, the tax bureau has done its best, but it still cannot be eradicated, which is affected by the difficult lives of the people. He hoped that the industry would cooperate fully in the future. If they hear of any smuggled cigarettes, please report them to the association immediately so that they can be forwarded to the tax bureau for investigation and crackdown, which will be beneficial to both national taxes and business operations. Today, Director Xie is holding this tea party here for the sake of safeguarding the business of our industry, which is a great kindness. He requested that all of our representatives stand up and thank Director Xie and express their respect. Then, the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council to Change Office Hours</h3>
<p>From October 1st, the office hours of the various departments of the Shanghai Municipal Council will be changed to 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily. Saturdays will be 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>Wednesday, October 4th, will be a holiday for the Shanghai Municipal Council, and all offices will be closed.</p>
<h3>Engineering Society Lecture</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Engineers held a regular meeting at the Bank Association at 7:00 PM on September 25th. More than 30 people attended. After dinner, Chairman Xu Peihuang reported on the resolutions of the annual meeting related to the branch. Next, Zhuang Zhihuan, Zhu Shuyi, and Wu Yunchu were publicly elected as election committee members to prepare for the election of new officers for the next branch term. Then, Mr. Fan Laishe, an Englishman, was invited to give a lecture on the problem of solid lubricants. Mr. Fan has been in China for 30 years and has served as an engineer on the Daqing Railway and the Hunan-Hubei Railway. He has rich experience in locomotive engineering. He explained how to use solid lubricants and compared the economic convenience of liquid lubricants, as well as how to retrofit locomotives that currently use liquid lubricants to use solid lubricants. Next, Mr. Wang Chengfu was invited to give a lecture on aviation. Mr. Wang has traveled to Europe and the United States and has a deep understanding of flying and manufacturing. Mr. Wang listed the position of aviation in national defense, the comparison of aviation equipment in various countries, the deployment of aircraft in air warfare, the latest progress in aircraft engineering, and how China should develop its aviation, without omission. The most alarming thing is that China must quickly find ways to manufacture aircraft and cultivate aviation talents by engaging in aviation regardless of the boundaries of study abroad. Only then will the future of aviation be promising. After the lecture, there was a discussion, and the meeting adjourned at more than 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Two Railways to Operate Special Tide-Watching Trains</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways will operate special tide-watching trains on October 6th, 7th, and 8th, with one round trip from Shanghai North Station to Xieqiao each day. The fare remains the same, 8.5 yuan per ticket and 3.5 yuan per meal ticket. Tickets will be sold soon at Shanghai North Station and the railway office (No. 407 Jing'an Temple Road). China Travel Service, Thomas Cook, and American Express Bank also sell tickets on consignment. It is also learned that the water journey from Xieqiao to Haining used to be carried out by private boats, which took a long time. This time, steamships will be used for towing, which is relatively faster. According to local elders, Zhejiang Province has recently experienced two typhoons, and the undertow of the Qiantang River is very strong. It is expected that this year's tide will be even more magnificent and spectacular. Travelers should not miss this good opportunity.</p>
<h3>Wang Jinlan, the Leader of the Kidnappers in the Xu Leqing Case, Arrested</h3>
<p>At the Same Time, Several Male and Female Kidnappers Were Also Arrested</p>
<p>A Handgun, Bullets, and a Letter Were Seized</p>
<p>－It Was Found That the Bandits Had Kidnapped a Mr. Shen on Yunnan Road－</p>
<p>Xu Leqing, a broker at the Gauze Exchange, was killed by kidnappers on September 1st on his way from his residence to the Exchange in Jing'an Temple, West Shanghai. After the incident, Inspector Lu Liankui arrested several criminals, who are being held for interrogation. Now, Chief Detective You A'gen, Detective Xie Shuiquan, Liu Junqing, Zhou Guisen, and Detective Lang Zuyin of the Old Gate Police Station learned that accomplices in the case were hiding in Room 18 of the Aidu Hotel on Bali Bridge Road in the French Concession. So, at 9:30 AM the day before, they applied to the French Concession Police Station and requested additional detectives to assist in the search of the hotel. They arrested a man named Shan Yongxiang. According to Shan's confession, the leader Wang Laojiu (also known as Wang Jinlan and Wang Xiaomei) and others were hiding in Room 59 of the Champagne Hotel on Yunnan Road. They immediately rushed there and arrested Wang and Xu Huanjin. Then, based on Shan's confession, they rushed to No. 10, Lane 171, Xujiahui Road, and successively detained four men and women: Zhang Xiong, Wang Jinyun, Wang Zhang, and Yao Zhifa, and seized two handguns and sixteen bullets. Finally, they went to No. 39 Xinzha Road and found a fake handgun and a letter. The bandits were all from Shaoxing and were all young men. According to the investigation by the investigating detectives, these people had committed many major cases of kidnapping for ransom, robbery, and injury. In addition to the shooting of Xu Leqing, they had kidnapped a Mr. Shen on Yunnan Road in March of this year, who was redeemed by his family for 25,000 yuan. In August, they gathered a crowd and entered the Yongfeng Silk Weaving Factory on Xujiahui Road and robbed a large sum of cash. The bandit Wang Laojiu also had several major cases in Zhejiang Province and was indeed a ringleader among the bandits. Yesterday morning, Chief Detective You and others took the seven men and women, along with the weapons, to the First Special District Court. After Judge Feng Shide interrogated them, Lawyer Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, stated the circumstances of the arrest of the bandits. Because the bandit Wang Laojiu had confessed to the police station, he requested that she be interrogated first, and then the case be adjourned for further investigation before filing a complaint. The court immediately questioned Wang Laojiu about the circumstances of the kidnapping of Xu Leqing and the shooting of Xu when the kidnapping failed. According to Wang's confession, the kidnapping of Xu was discussed and agreed upon by Wu Youshan, who had already been arrested, at No. 7 Xiude Lane, Julai Da Road. Because I am a junior, I only listened from the side. Wu and a Mr. Zhang discussed how to kidnap him, and I don't know the details. When I went to kidnap him, I went alone and kept watch from the side. Yao Zhifa fired a handgun, and so on. Judge Feng then ordered Shan Yongxiang and others to be detained and adjourned the hearing for further interrogation.</p>

<h3>Homespun Cloth and American Virtue</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>There was Han Wengong in China who wore large cloth robes and large silk hats, and there was Gandhi in India who spun homespun yarn and wove homespun cloth all his life. Of all the people in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, the most worthy of admiration and praise are those who wear cloth clothes. When we were young, we adhered to the principle of "warm cloth and full vegetable rice," and wore the cloth clothes that my mother spun, wove, and sewed herself. Wearing them on our bodies, we felt indescribably happy. "The loving mother's hand threads; the wanderer's body clothes." In my old box, there are one or two short shirts made of homespun cloth, which were made by my old mother twenty years ago. They are patched and worn again and again. My wife has made many short shirts for me, but the cloth bought outside is never as durable as the one spun and woven by my old mother. My belief in homespun cloth lies in this. I still remember when I was young, under the dim light of a small lamp, I read books and my mother wove cloth. The sound of reading and the sound of the loom were interesting. When I finished reading, my mother was happy for me, and when the cloth was woven, I was happy for my mother, and I was also happy myself, because after it was dyed well, I would have a new long shirt made of homespun cloth. I also remember that my mother had a box in which all the clothes were neatly arranged. She would not wear them easily at ordinary times. She said that this was my wedding dress from more than ten years ago, which she and your grandmother had spun and woven when she was waiting to get married. I was grateful to the extreme at that time. I also remember that when I got engaged at the age of nine, in addition to four small silver ingots, there were also eight pieces of green cloth as an engagement gift, which were also my mother's achievements. This year, I accidentally found two bundles of green cloth. My wife said that this was made of the green cloth from the engagement. It is not broken or damaged at all. How precious and memorable this is. The paragraph above proves the durability of homespun cloth and the virtue of the original family. In any case, this good atmosphere should not only not be overthrown but should also be promoted. If people still have homespun cloth spun and woven by themselves, I think that at least tens of millions of productivity will be increased in a year. I feel that Chinese people, especially Shanghainese, are too fashionable. If someone wears cloth clothes, they are either looked down upon or laughed at as being rustic, calling them bumpkins. Therefore, in such a large country as China, not many people in the intellectual class wear cloth clothes. I would like to mention two people I know among my friends, one is Lu Zuofu, the Gandhi of Sichuan, and the other is Bu Shuangqiu, the Gandhi of Hunan. Mr. Lu is an industrialist, and Mr. Bu is an educator. They have a strong will and always maintain the dignity of their homespun clothes, no matter where they go, which is truly admirable. The homespun cloth movement is not just an empty shout, nor is it a showy move. It is for the sake of saving customs, saving the country, saving the poor, saving the countryside, and saving the family. This homespun cloth conference initiated by Mr. Zhang Fengshan and others is of particular significance. Because Shanghainese are too modernized, a piece of clothing costs dozens of gold, and a material costs hundreds of gold. As long as the husband wants to win the favor of his beloved wife, and the mother wants to make her young lady happy, they abandon their own good cotton cloth to buy foreign cloth, Russian flower labels, Indian yarn, and European and American crepe to wear. Nearby places are infected by this trend, and young masters and country girls are almost assimilated by Shanghainese, which is a very dangerous thing. Now, we take this opportunity to vigorously advocate and promote it, so that people know that the homespun cloth, which has always been regarded as foolish, actually has many advantages and many places that surpass foreign cloth. Perhaps it will make a lot of contributions to regaining rights. Even if people say you are foolish, you still rush to do this foolish work. I admire the enthusiasm of the initiators. Since they have asked me to say a few words several times, I will just contribute some casually.</p>
<h3>Five Reasons to Promote Homespun Cloth</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yi</p>
<p>In the modern era of scientific prosperity, machine-woven products are constantly changing and the production volume is increasing year by year. People are still chanting the promotion of homespun cloth, which is simply unreasonable and must be a laggard of the times.</p>
<p>No - it is not like that. Machine-woven products should of course be promoted, and peasant-made homespun cloth should also be promoted. We must never fight for food for workers and not maintain a livelihood for farmers. At this time of advocating for homespun cloth, people with a little patriotism and understanding of the social and national situation would never dare to say that homespun cloth should not be promoted.</p>
<p>I am also a person who advocates promoting homespun cloth and rescuing the countryside. I will write down my reasons below:</p>
<p>(1) Weaving homespun cloth is the main sideline of farmers.</p>
<p>Among the 470 million people in our country, at least 399.5 million are farmers. Among the farmers, at least 119.85 million live by weaving. We must maintain food for more than 100 million compatriots. We have no choice but to shout and run around to promote homespun cloth. Therefore, promoting homespun cloth is a work to revive the countryside.</p>
<p>(2) The means of economic aggression by imperialists have increased without end. Foreign goods are poured in, and manufacturers have already suffered great losses. The sale of homespun cloth has been hit even harder. Our country's industry is extremely dangerous, and the foundation of the country is at stake, which cannot be taken lightly. Promoting national products is the main way to save the country. However, most of the so-called national products today take materials from foreign countries, accounting for six or seven out of ten, or even take other people's cooked goods, change the labels and repackage them, and use fake to confuse the real, which is very painful - homespun cloth is woven from local cotton and local yarn, which is undoubtedly a national product - therefore, promoting homespun cloth and resisting foreign cloth is an important work to save the country.</p>
<p>(3) Rural instability provides an opportunity for bandits and communists. The current state of rural areas in our country is that nine out of ten households are empty. Begging for food and asking for help has become a constant record in newspapers, which is an obstacle to national construction and political training. The instability of rural areas is due to the reduction of production and the compensation of local products. Without a sideline to subsidize him, the national rural areas will be bankrupt in the near future. The continuation of the inherent sideline of agriculture should help its development and enrich the farmers. Therefore, promoting homespun cloth is a work to stabilize the countryside.</p>
<p>(4) Since the opening of the sea ban, customs have become increasingly extravagant, and clothing styles are competing for novelty and difference, and many materials are taken from foreign countries, which not only leads to the loss of money, but also the various evils of the current society are mostly caused by this. Homespun cloth is simple, practical, thrifty, and elegant. Making it into clothing has a noble air. Using it as curtains has a simple and pure style. This is the reason why female students in Beijing and Shanghai first wore homespun cloth. It can be seen that promoting homespun cloth is a work to save the declining customs.</p>
<p>(5) Our country's production is backward, and the national economy is gradually entering a dead end. To maintain the status quo and gradually revive the country, advocating thrift is also an important method. Homespun cloth is cheap and durable, and is the most economical clothing material. If everyone wears it, then a lot of financial resources will be saved unknowingly, and a lot of funds will be accumulated. Because of this, promoting homespun cloth is an active way to save the national economy. In summary of the above five points, it can be seen that the promotion of homespun cloth cannot be delayed, and I hope that enthusiastic people in society will rise up to advocate it in order to fulfill a duty to benefit the people and consolidate the country!</p>
<h3>My Discussion on Wearing Native Cloth</h3>
<p>— Yao Huiquan</p>
<p>I am a thorough and genuine farmer's son. I remember that from the time I became conscious until I graduated from elementary school at the age of fourteen, everything I wore was old native cloth. Back then, the native cloth in my family came from:</p>
<p>Cotton produced in our own fields;</p>
<p>Ginned cotton fluff from our own cotton gin;</p>
<p>Loose cotton prepared by my mother and sisters-in-law;</p>
<p>Cotton strips spun by my grandmother;</p>
<p>Cotton yarn spun by the women of the family;</p>
<p>Old cloth woven by my mother and sisters-in-law;</p>
<p>Native colors dyed by local dye shops;</p>
<p>It was truly and completely domestic product, and furthermore, it was "native goods" and "home goods." At that time, none of the families of my neighbors, relatives, and friends wore anything other than this kind of cotton fabric. Once, my uncle got married, which was quite the grand occasion. The guests who came, dressed in red and green, wore either domestic silks and satins or "home goods" old cloth; it was nearly impossible to find a single foreign product. For those few days, I wore an old blue cloth lined robe, covered with a black cloth lined mandarin jacket, black cloth socks on my feet, black cloth shoes, and a small satin cap on my head. When I looked at myself in the mirror, I truly looked dashingly bright. This was my period of completely wearing "home goods" old native cloth.</p>
<p>The year after I graduated from elementary school, I unexpectedly became the principal of a rural elementary school. When purchasing books and stationery, I inevitably had to visit Shanghai. Being exposed to new things, the economic invasion of imperialism began to affect me. Dutch white drill shorts and shirts, British (as it was then called) white merino wool long gowns, German Eagle Globe brand cotton socks—piece by piece, item by item, began to appear on my person. This continued until I entered teachers' college. After graduating, I became a teacher and then principal at a municipal school, and later an education administrator. Thus, I gradually "progressed" (?) to wearing serge long gowns, Zhigong woolen mandarin jackets, British leather shoes, Italian felt hats; and eventually, Western suits made entirely of imported goods. By the time of the May Thirtieth Incident, I estimate that I had contributed nearly a thousand yuan to foreigners in the span of ten years! In reality, at that time, my mind was filled with the idea that as long as it was "stylish," it was fine, and there was no concept of "domestic goods" versus "foreign goods." This was my period of wearing foreign goods.</p>
<p>Spurred by the May Thirtieth Incident, patriotic thought greatly developed. I stopped buying foreign suits and gradually began wearing Chinese silk and satin clothing, but I still couldn't shake the concept of "stylishness." After the Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai in 1927, seeing that general party comrades and people in the education field mostly wore foreign clothing, I felt very disapproving in my heart. The "September 18th" Incident suddenly occurred, and along with the people I believed in, I ran around shouting and seeking ways to alleviate the national crisis. I believed that for those of us who were powerless, the only thing we could do was to lead by example, providing material assistance and spiritual support to the Northeast volunteer army. Therefore, I scrimped and saved money to actively donate, and I made three public agreements with my family:</p>
<p>(1) No going to theaters or movie theaters or game parlors—gambling and dancing were never my thing anyway.</p>
<p>(2) Gifts for weddings, funerals, and celebrations should be limited to a maximum of two yuan.</p>
<p>(3) All clothing must be made of "home goods" native cloth.</p>
<p>At the same time, I tried my best to spread our ideas among relatives and friends. Especially at several lavish celebratory banquets in Shanghai, I wore a native cloth robe and mandarin jacket, my wife wore a native cloth cheongsam, and my two eldest sons wore native cloth children's clothing, calmly and lively interacting with fashionable men and women. We truly moved quite a few people!</p>
<p>By the time of the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident, many relatives and friends were following our example. During the Shanghai Incident, I handled the supply work for the 19th Route Army, wearing native cloth clothing and riding in a car, rushing between Shanghai, Zhenru, and the front lines, which attracted even more attention from relatives and friends. As long as they were relatives and friends who were closely related to me, I could guarantee that they would absolutely not buy foreign goods, and the idea that wearing native cloth was "rustic" completely changed, and they started wearing it themselves. The money saved from this, along with all kinds of cosmetics and food, was truly considerable.</p>
<p>My eldest son, who is just six years old this year, also has his little brain filled with nationalistic thoughts and a concept of thrift. He wears native cloth children's clothing himself and doesn't buy snacks. When he sees relatives and friends who don't wear native cloth Chinese clothing but instead wear domestic woolen Western suits, he always asks after greeting them politely whether the material is foreign and why they don't use native cloth to make it. This year on New Year's Day, a close relative came and wanted to take him to the movies, but he replied that he didn't want to go until the Northeast was recovered. This close relative was greatly moved, and naturally the movie was not watched, and he hasn't even touched his favorite mahjong tiles to this day.</p>
<p>Based on our experience, I deeply believe that as long as I start doing something good myself, it can be expanded. Who doesn't hope to reduce the annual leakage of wealth, improve the rural economy, and save on their own expenses? Then wear native cloth as a starting point: for example, if the three million people in Shanghai each bought one yuan worth of native cloth per year, it would be enough to bring considerable benefits to the farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai. Once Shanghai promotes it, other places will surely follow suit, and the amount of money flowing out can be reduced in customs statistics, and you yourself can save a considerable amount of money due to the low price and durability of native cloth.</p>
<p>Come! Especially comrades who have a place in society, and well-reputed organizations, let's create a frugal atmosphere, let's create a habit of wearing native cloth. If you are patriotic, you should start with yourself!</p>
<p>Finally, I offer two suggestions as the conclusion of this article:</p>
<p>First, cloth spun from native cotton by rural women during their leisure time should be called native cloth, and it is meaningful and valuable. The benefits to farmers are greater, and it is more in line with the purpose of promoting rural side occupations. If cloth is woven from factory yarn, it can at most be called domestic cloth, but not native cloth. Only earning some wages is probably not enough to live on. Some people are fooled by unscrupulous merchants and mistakenly buy cheap Japanese factory yarn (very common in rural areas) and weave it into falsely named native cloth, which is even more off the mark. This is something that promotion agencies should pay special attention to.</p>
<p>Second, the evenness of the yarn count, the wash-fastness of the dyeing, and the widening of the width of the fabric should all be carefully studied by the promotion agencies and given detailed guidance. Having a cooperative organization is the best policy. If there is no planning for promotion and sales, it will never be permanent, and even if it is勉强maintained, the actual benefits to farmers will be very limited.</p>

<p>Historical Records</p>
<h3>The History of the "September 18th" Nine Factories Domestic Goods Market</h3>
<p>— Yang</p>
<p>The "September 18th" temporary market of the nine factories should not be viewed as an ordinary event. Its great achievements and magnificent creations must be recorded.</p>
<p>Last year, I received letters from my old friends Fang Jun Yixian, Ren Jun Shigang, and Fang Jun Jiange from Moganshan. They said that the China Chemical Industry Society, Meya Silk Weaving Factory, Sanyou Industrial Society, Wuhe Weaving Factory, China Enamel Factory, China First Knitting Factory, Huashe Hat Factory, Shengde Weaving Factory, and Yixin Toothbrush Factory had leased the original site of Qihua Company on Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>, and established a "September 18th" Domestic Goods Market, on the one hand to commemorate the unprecedented national humiliation, and on the other hand to express the promotion of domestic goods. I was very happy, thinking that the leaders of the domestic goods industry could be so enthusiastic and would surely win the approval of the citizens of Shanghai. After the opening, customers actually flocked to it, setting a new record for front-door retail sales. After I came down from the mountain, I met Ren and Fang, as well as Chang Bijian in Hangzhou. They all said that in the four or five days after the opening of the Nine Factories Market, there were crowds of people everywhere, and they were too busy to handle it all. Everyone barely had time to eat. The managers also personally participated and worked together with their employees. It was like this at the beginning, like this five or six days later, and still like this more than ten days later. It can be seen that everyone has a patriotic heart. Nanjing Road will definitely not allow people to sell foreign goods. Because they had the grand vision of creating a domestic goods company, they hired managers, rented houses, and united factories. Several managers were extremely busy. I also strongly encouraged them to turn theory into reality. Not long after, Wu Jun Zhihao and others first established a Shanghai Domestic Goods Company at the original site of the Nine Factories Market. Then, everyone still followed the original plan, determined to build a Mainland Market, and prepared to establish a China Domestic Goods Company. These two domestic goods companies were born on Nanjing Road during the Domestic Goods Year, facing the Three Companies from afar. This is like a small mother giving birth to two lovely children. How could she not be happy, how could she not celebrate? It can be represented by the following diagram:</p>
<p>"September 18th" Nine Factories Temporary Domestic Goods Market - Shanghai Domestic Goods Company - China Domestic Goods Company</p>
<p>These two companies praise the September 18th Market. Although there is no direct relationship, although they are not direct descendants, it is unanimously recognized that these two major domestic goods companies were born because of this September 18th Market.</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. The annual "September 18th" anniversary is coming again. The managers of these nine factories are truly enthusiastic. They all said that the domestic goods market last year was very memorable and that it was necessary to continue to hold it. They also said that the location should be changed every year. Last year it was in the central district, this year it can be in the western district, and next year and the year after that it can be held in the northern, eastern, and southern districts in turn. Everyone said it was very valuable. At the same time, with the help of the Social Affairs Bureau, they borrowed the St. George's Ballroom in Jing'an Temple to hold it. This year, the nine factories were invited to participate again. For example, Hongxin's cloth, Guangdong Brothers' rubber shoes, Huachang's steel essence, Zhanghua's wool, Yaguang's bakelite and celluloid, Dahua's steel cable appliances, Shanghai Light Bulb's light bulbs, Yutai's thermos bottles, and everything from the China Domestic Goods Company, will open at 9:18 AM and close at 9:18 PM every day. The China Domestic Goods Company has selected 918 kinds of exquisite products to sell at the market. It has everything and is especially unique. From nine factories to eighteen factories, from nine to eighteen, next year today, or from eighteen to thirty-six, seventy-two, the cooperation of non-industry members has already achieved such results. The greatness of its creation and the magnitude of its achievements can be imagined. Entering the market, east is September 18th, west is September 18th, everyone thinks of September 18th, mourns September 18th, and does not forget September 18th, so that this strange humiliation of September 18th can be washed away as soon as possible. On the banks of the Liao River and at the peaks of Changbai Mountain, there are achievements of my eighteen factories everywhere. The sale of my eighteen factories' products there will make the establishment of this market even more significant.</p>
<h3>Opening Remarks: Jing'an Temple and the Domestic Goods Market</h3>
<p>— Tianran</p>
<p>The Jing'an Temple area is generally recognized as a residential area in Shanghai. It reaches Haig Road in the south, connects Jessfield Road in the north, and leads to Yuyuan Road in the west. The area is shaded by lush trees, with luxurious cars filling the roads. Magnificent mansions are everywhere, and those who enter and exit them are all ladies and misses. These ladies and misses have mostly received secondary education or above. The McTyeire School, St. Mary's Hall, and Shanghai University are all places where these ladies and misses come from. In terms of patriotism, these ladies and misses are certainly a hundred times better than the emaciated, yellowish-faced women in the thatched huts of Jiangbei. In terms of purchasing power, these ladies and misses are certainly a thousand times better than the penniless scholars who cannot even afford their next meal. Their families' consumption of clothing, food, housing, and transportation is naturally controlled by these ladies and misses. The husbands and sons only follow the lead of these ladies and misses. Therefore, someone once made a crazy statement, saying that a large domestic goods company could be established in the Jing'an Temple area to cater to these ladies and misses. Someone else said that the Bathing Buddha Festival on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month, the grand market of Jing'an Temple, is full of shoulder-to-shoulder crowds and fragrant clothes and hair ornaments. It is a pity that it is not purely domestic goods, otherwise it would be a good opportunity to promote domestic products.</p>
<p>From the large domestic goods company, I think of the domestic goods markets of various factories.</p>
<p>From the eighth day of the fourth lunar month (Bathing Buddha Festival), I think of September 18th (National Humiliation Day of Japan's Occupation of Liaodong).</p>
<p>Thus, the "September 18th" Nine Factories Temporary Domestic Goods Market? Opened on the anniversary of the September 18th Incident. On the opening day, in the midst of miserable wind and rain, customers flocked to it, undiminished in their enthusiasm for using domestic goods. Women are the cornerstone of purchasing power. This is generally recognized. However, based on my personal observation and reports from various parties, the customers of the Nine Factories Temporary Market are mostly men, and fewer women; mostly from the intellectual class, and fewer from the propertied class. The atmosphere of buying domestic goods near Jing'an Temple is far less enthusiastic than at the Three Companies and the Domestic Goods Company on Nanjing Road. Could it be that these ladies and misses do not like patriotism? Do they not enjoy using domestic goods? I know it is definitely not so. In a word, they still lack faith, and it is still our lack of effort in promotion. Here, I dare to solemnly tell these highly educated ladies and misses with patriotic thoughts.</p>
<p>(1) The establishment of this temporary market is entirely to commemorate the national humiliation of "September 18th." In this year of domestic goods, I hope everyone will leave a deep memory and vow from now on to use domestic goods as a way to repay and save the country.</p>
<p>(2) The goods in this market can be called purely domestic goods. There are neither products that have been disguised, nor items that are counterfeit or secretly sold. Ladies and misses, you can rest assured and buy and use them as much as you like.</p>
<p>(3) In order to arouse the interest and confidence of ladies and misses, the prices of the goods in this market are extremely cheap, making them especially worthwhile.</p>
<p>(4) The establishment of this market is entirely to provide convenience for the citizens of the residential area of western Shanghai to purchase goods. I hope that on the way from Yuyuan Road to Jessfield Road and Haig Road, among the fragrant cars and beautiful carriages, amidst the warbling voices and floral shadows, everything that is seen, heard, and spoken is domestic goods. I know that when the ladies and misses return home in the evening, they will all say, "Domestic goods are indeed good" and "Domestic goods are no worse than foreign goods," and their voices will be full of pearls and jade.</p>
<p>(5) The establishment of this market is most convenient for those near McTyeire and St. Mary's, and farther away for those at St. John's, Aurora, and Great China Universities. People say that these universities are the least patriotic and most fond of using foreign goods. Taking advantage of this opportunity, you gentlemen can show your colors and wash away this criticism.</p>
<p>Lovely Jing'an Temple, enviable residential area of Jing'an Temple, and even more lovely Nine Factories Temporary Market. Those of you who used to enter and exit St. George's Ballroom must not miss this solemn and magnificent Nine Factories Domestic Goods Market today. And do not forget this once-a-year Nine Factories Domestic Goods Market established to commemorate "September 18th."</p>
<h3>The Temporary Domestic Goods Market Near Jing'an Temple</h3>
<p>— Xu Lüqian</p>
<p>The long-awaited second "September 18th" Nine Factories Temporary Domestic Goods Market finally held its opening ceremony with a very solemn and grand ceremony at 9:18 AM on the anniversary of the September 18th Incident! The market is located at the original site of the St. George's Ballroom at the Jing'an Temple tram station in western Shanghai. I still remember that when various factories commemorated the first anniversary of the September 18th Incident last year, it was held at Qihua Company on Nanjing Road and lasted for three or four weeks. This year, the scope has been expanded. In addition to the nine famous basic factories, nine more participants have been invited, making a total of eighteen factories. The scale is even larger. A colorful archway made of pine, cypress, and electric lights is erected at the entrance of the ballroom, shining brightly at night. Stepping inside, one's eyes and ears are refreshed. Indeed, undoubtedly, domestic goods have now achieved a considerable position. You see, even the fashionable "misses" wearing high heels, who have always been completely pushing foreign goods, now have a considerable understanding and recognition of domestic goods! If you don't believe it, look: aren't they enthusiastically entering and exiting in groups of three or five, arm in arm? This, of course, is a symbol of the good prospects for domestic goods!</p>
<p>Indeed, in recent years, domestic goods have made amazing breakthroughs in both quality and quantity. Therefore, the exquisiteness of the products is no less than that of imported goods. The obvious facts show us that it can be warmly loved and welcomed by the general public. Indeed, I believe that if domestic goods can actively and permanently erupt and strive like bamboo shoots after a rain, in a few years, domestic goods will fill the market, and foreign goods will naturally disappear invisibly! Even in Shanghai, the most prosperous city in China.</p>
<p>I hope that my most beloved ladies and comrades who care about domestic goods, you should definitely visit when you have free time to see the latest amazing products of various factories on display in 1933. They are so beautiful that you won't be able to take your eyes off them. For people living in western Shanghai, it is particularly convenient as it is so close. The specified dates are from September 18th to Double Tenth Day, and the daily business hours are from 9:18 AM to 9:18 PM to commemorate the true meaning.</p>
<h3>Prelude to Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>"Hoeing millet under the midday sun, sweat drips onto the soil beneath the plants, who knows that every grain on the plate is the result of hardship?" This is what the ancients said about white rice, which must go from grain to rough rice and then to spring rice before being cooked and eaten. Every drop of sweat and every grain of rice is so difficult to obtain!</p>
<p>The clothes we wear on our bodies must go from cotton to yarn and then be woven into cloth before being cut and sewn. Every drop of sweat and every thread of yarn</p>
<p>is also so difficult to obtain!</p>
<p>I can say: "Who knows that every thread of clothing is the result of hardship." Ever since foreign cloth was favored and native cloth was abandoned, the rural economy has collapsed and the breath of the nation is almost gone. This is like the concubine seizing power, the first wife being suppressed, the family declining, and the matter being handled by an incompetent advisor! Therefore, to preserve the lifeblood of the nation, everyone should wear native cloth made from self-grown cotton, self-spun yarn, and self-woven cloth. Everyone should think of "Who knows that every thread of clothing is the result of hardship." It is better to be a wealthy and long-lived country bumpkin wearing native cloth than to be a worried person who has no rice for breakfast or dinner but still wears fashionable clothes, sacrificing himself for appearance!</p>
<h3>The Lively Domestic Goods Market</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>The preparations for the fourth municipal national exhibition have been underway for a long time. The sensational "Fourth Municipal Domestic Goods Exhibition" opened at the Penglai Market in Xiaoximen on the afternoon of the 15th of this month. Mayor Wu (representing) raised the flag, and Ms. Hu Die unveiled the curtain. Since then, people from all walks of life have paid close attention and have come in droves. In recent days, carriages and horses have been like clouds, and visitors have been flocking in an endless stream. The call to promote domestic goods has also been raised high into the clouds. According to this exhibition, 176 domestic goods factories participated. The elites gathered together, the light of domestic goods shone brightly, and all kinds of goods were displayed without any lack of beauty. The decoration and equipment were magnificent and resplendent. At night, the electric lights shone brightly, dazzling the eyes. The lively scene was unprecedented, adding a lot of color to the Year of Domestic Goods.</p>
<p>The Pain of the Nine Factories Domestic Goods Market - With the approach of the second anniversary of "September 18th", this meaningful and valuable commemorative market was also established near Jing'an Temple, "commemorating the national humiliation with a spirit of struggle." The so-called promotion of industry and saving the country with domestic goods has a profound purpose and is worthy of admiration. This temporary market is organized by: China Chemical Industry Society, Sanyou Industrial Society, China Enamel Factory, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Meya Silk Weaving Factory, Huafu Hat Factory, China First Knitting Factory, Yixin Toothbrush Factory, Shengde Weaving Factory, and other nine famous domestic goods factories in Shanghai. It achieved considerable results in the first session of the market last year. This second session is also jointly organized by Guangdong Brothers Rubber Company, Zhanghua Wool Spinning Company, Yutai Thermos Factory, Huachang Steel Factory, China Domestic Goods Company, Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Yaguang Manufacturing Company, Dahua Iron Factory, and other eight companies. The scale is wider, the sacrifice is greater, and the efforts are made. Our people should enthusiastically help them succeed.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the National Goods Movement</h3>
<p>— Gongxin</p>
<p>Second Anniversary of the September 18th Incident</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, the heartbreaking September 18th Incident has come before our eyes for the second time! It represents the greatest shame of our entire nation, representing our national hatred. On this day, all the people of the Republic of China, regardless of men, women, old or young, all gnashed their teeth in hatred and their blood boiled. Four hundred million hearts are united in the desire for "revenge" and "redemption"!</p>
<p>But how to take revenge, how to redeem ourselves?</p>
<p>Facts tell us that the entire Chinese nation is suffering from a terrible, long-term anemia. For sixty years, bright red blood has been constantly flowing outwards, flowing into small streams, flowing into rivers, flowing into oceans, turning us into weaklings, invalids, and finally unable to resist the invasion of foreign evils! This has created painful history like the September 18th Incident!</p>
<p>In recent years, the rural economy has collapsed, and the industrial and commercial sectors have been in recession. The symptoms of anemia are becoming more and more pronounced every day! As a result, the decline and demise of the entire nation is an inevitable and inevitable common law!</p>
<p>Today, the only policy to save the nation is "stopping the bleeding" and "replenishing the blood." The way to stop the bleeding is not to use foreign goods, and the way to replenish the blood is to promote domestic goods. This year has been designated as "National Goods Year" by the National Government, and the voices promoting domestic goods are also very loud in society. In Shanghai, domestic goods manufacturers have indeed made a lot of efforts this year, and many products have been able to outperform imported goods in terms of quality and quantity, while the pricing is extremely low. This is indeed a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>Society is interconnected. Promoting domestic goods certainly requires the efforts of the industrial and commercial sectors, but government rewards and social atmosphere are also two of the most important factors. Recently, the Japanese government ordered its residents in Shanghai to purchase Japanese goods, which is a noteworthy example. As for fostering a social atmosphere, it is especially important for leading figures, school teachers, and family fathers and brothers to unanimously promote domestic goods and lead by example.</p>
<p>China, which is in turmoil and full of national crises, is in the midst of a fierce international economic war. If we do not unite and strive in production, there is really no reason to survive. With a country of 400 million people's purchasing power, if we start today and implement a "stop the bleeding" and "replenish the blood" movement, concentrating the countless money in the domestic goods market, then the cities will naturally prosper, and the peasants' blood will not flow outwards, and the countryside will naturally prosper as well. At the same time, combining the strength of the government and the people, we can engage in the development of resources and practical construction projects. Then the hope of national rejuvenation is not impossible to realize.</p>
<p>Redeem ourselves! Take revenge! Revive the Chinese nation! We must start with the national economy! As long as all of us compatriots make our final determination and become economic warriors, engaging in ten years of building up strength, and absolutely not buying foreign goods, especially goods from a certain country, then the mysterious barracks that a certain country recently built in Hongkou for two million yuan will be worth zero! Strive! Compatriots! Do not forget "September 18th"! Do not forget domestic goods!</p>
<h3>Canned Foods and the Rural Economy</h3>
<p>— Yihong</p>
<p>With the convenience of transportation, the goods of imperialism are also actively attacking the inland rural areas with dumping policies. The result is the decline of production and the collapse of the economy. But can the farmers in the interior enjoy the benefits of convenient transportation? No—durable agricultural products such as rice, wheat, cotton, and beans are subject to heavy taxes and inconvenient transportation along the way, making it impossible for them to compete with foreign goods in the cities, although the railway freight rates for agricultural products have been reduced a lot now. Non-durable agricultural products such as vegetables, fruits, fish, and shrimp are also subject to the same fate because they are not easy to preserve for a long time. Ah! "Cheap grain hurts farmers" and now another "undeveloped side occupations," how can the countryside not go bankrupt? Therefore, the manufacture of canned foods, which indirectly relieves the rural areas and directly relieves the side occupations, is a matter of urgency; because it can absorb the surplus products of the rural areas, making the best use of the land and resources.</p>
<p>The canned food industry is the child of modern science. It can preserve the freshness of food, allowing it to spread far and wide for the enjoyment of all. Now we commonly eat British milk, American fruit juice, German beef juice, French wine, and various other canned foods. The reason why these "imported goods" can sell well in the market is due to the catering to the tastes of the Chinese people and the lack of domestic canned food manufacturing; even if there are some, the products are not very perfect, so it is difficult to meet the needs of society.</p>
<h3>National Products</h3>
<p>— Huang Molian</p>
<p>In the year of national products, at the national products market, excellent national products compete to be praised; everyone loves the country, everyone wants them, foreign goods from now on will not flourish!</p>
<p>In the year of national products, at the national products market, inexpensive national products compete to be praised; everyone loves the country, everyone buys them, foreign goods from now on have ill omens!</p>
<p>In the year of national products, national products are promoted, fashionable national products compete to be praised; everyone loves the country, everyone uses them, foreign goods from now on will not last long!</p>
<p>"Excellent," "inexpensive," and "fashionable" are three key considerations when selecting goods. Now, looking at the goods at temporary national product markets such as the Nine Factories National Products Market, these three qualities are indeed present. When we buy them, we are very satisfied. Moreover, we are fulfilling our patriotic aspirations, so why not do it!</p>

<h3>Financial Telegram: Stabilizing the U.S. Dollar, Speculation Shows a Particularly Strong Rebound</h3>
<p>— Accelerated Rebound of Fourteen Yuan and Three Cents —</p>
<p>Since the market fell the day before yesterday, it rebounded vigorously yesterday. The market situation was very healthy in the morning. At the start, although silver prices in the British and American markets rose, they did not rise by much. In addition, forward silver prices on the Gold and Silver Exchange actually showed a slight drop. Exchange rates also declined across the board. The price of spot gold in London rose by five pence, and the price of newly mined gold in the United States also rose by 19 cents to $31.49. U.S. cotton was down five points per pound, stocks were down 62.5 cents, and U.S. wheat was also down 2.375 cents. People's confidence stabilized. The opening price of the raw gold market jumped to 75.6 yuan, and then slightly declined. After opening, due to sluggish banking, it gradually rose and mostly fluctuated. After breaking through 80 yuan, people's confidence rose further. A Reuters dispatch from New York reported that bankers on Wall Street hoped to stabilize the U.S. dollar price as soon as possible, so that the huge amount of capital (approximately 500 million yuan) that had flowed abroad could be recovered. This news further boosted the market. Banks seized the opportunity to sell at high prices, and there were several setbacks, but due to the strong support of Chinese merchants, demand in the market exceeded supply, and the afternoon closing was the strongest. It turned out that the positive rebound after the price increases and decreases the day before. The spot price was 1,105 yuan. Here is a record of the market situation for half the day:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 774.5 yuan, a rebound of 4.5 yuan compared to the previous closing. The opening price of goods was 4.2 cents. The opening exchange rate for near-term sales was one shilling, three pence, 4375 for British currency and 30.5 yuan for U.S. currency. Fuyu, Richang, Yuansheng, Yongyuan, Chunyifeng, Yongfuchang, and Tongtaichang continued to buy, and rose from 3.2 cents to 7.7 cents. Hua Bi sold U.S. dollars for December at .0625, and fluctuated slightly, but Tongtaichang, Richang, Changyong, Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yongruikang and others bought vigorously. HSBC announced its listed prices, with the shilling unchanged and the U.S. dollar down .125. At this time, it had risen to 8.8 cents. Dafa and Yuansheng Yongyuan sold. Hua Bi came out with U.S. dollars for December at 31 yuan, but fell back to 6.9 cents. Daxing, Yongruikang, Hongxing, Qianchang, Xiangheng, Yuqingfa Yong and others all bought, and the price rose to 82.5 yuan. HSBC came out with U.S. dollars for January at .1875. Changsheng Yong Zhaofeng Chang sold within one cent. Meifeng Hua Bi then sold U.S. dollars for November at .625. Heng Yu, Yuanmao, Yonghengxing and others even sold at 78.7 cents. Dachangxiang slightly accepted goods, and rebounded to 81 yuan. The Dalian gang and Fuyu, Qingfa Yong, Yifeng Yong, and Tongtaichang supplied together, and the price fell again to 77.2 yuan. Hua Bi bought U.S. dollars for January at .3125 and stabilized. Mitsui bought the same month at .25. Yuanchun and Hengyu again rose above 80 yuan. News of a stabilized exchange rate came from foreign telegrams. Zhengchang, Yuanchun, Dafayong, Daxingyong, and Hengyu entered at 84 yuan. Ke Xian Na came out with U.S. dollars for January at .125. Hengyu sold strips, and the price fell to 2.2 cents. However, people's confidence was firm and the domestic market remained tight. Daxingyong and the Dalian gang bought vigorously, and the price rose to 84.5 yuan. After fluctuations, the afternoon closing was 784.3 yuan, and goods were priced at 4.5 cents. Later, Hengyu sold aggressively, and Bingxing also sold, falling back to within 3 yuan. The price remained low until the very end. The highest price for half the day was 784.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 773.2 yuan, a fluctuation of 11.3 yuan. As a result, it rose 14.3 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The announced price decreased because HSBC Bank's listed U.S. dollar exchange rate decreased by .125 to 30 yuan, which, according to the closing price, was equivalent to suppressing the price of gold by approximately 16 yuan. It was weaker and pressed more than ten yuan less than the previous closing. The registered price for this month was 798 yuan, for October 792 yuan, and for November 784 yuan. Supplemental water in the morning was 798 yuan. The spot price was 1,105 yuan. There was not much trading in the market. The Tianjin gang sold 200 taels to Tongfengyong for 1,112 yuan. Local goods were 1,109 yuan, sold by a fellow merchant to the Hong Kong gang. Dalian goods were 1,112.5 yuan. Trading was extremely slow. There were a total of 1,568 strips for this month, and 1,323 strips for October.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was quite active. In summary, Daxingyong, Changshengyong, Yuanchun, Tongchun, Ruikang, Zhengchang, Dachangxiang, Hongxing, Zhifengyong, and Richang were on the buying side. Hengyu, Yuanheng, Ruixing, Wanxing, Hengchang Yongda, Kangyuan, Xingyong, Shunli, and Hengxing were on the selling side. Tongtaichang, Yuansheng Yong, Fuyu, Qingfa Yong, and Yifeng Yong first bought and then sold. The Dalian gang bought over 500 and sold over 800. Shunli bought over 1,000 and sold over 1,700. The Guangdong gang Hengxing sold over 100 strips. Shengda was silent. There were a total of 28,266 November chips.</p>

<h3>Securities, Demobilization Public Bonds Rebound One Yuan</h3>
<p>— Scattered Short Positions Being Covered Actively —</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange gradually strengthened, because there was talk of the Japanese army cooperating with the Central Army to drive out Fang, and Fang's army was showing signs of fleeing south. Although the clouds of war were very pervasive, Beijing might be spared from disaster. Most of the previous day's decline was due to the pressure of the September futures market. Bulls reluctantly came out. Yesterday, buying and selling of September contracts had been stopped to prepare for settlement on the 29th. Only one month, October, was being traded in the market, and the situation tended to ease. There was quite a bit of covering of scattered short positions, and because the ups and downs from day to day were uneven, the amount of the rebound also varied. The morning session yesterday saw a rebound in both sessions. Demobilization bonds rose by half a yuan in the first session, and by another 67 cents in the second session, with others rising by 23 to 45 cents per session. The afternoon opening was slightly chaotic. Demobilization bonds continued to improve by three cents, while the rest saw mixed ups and downs, but the amounts were small. The closing was still firm, improving by another 12 cents. As a result, demobilization bonds rebounded by one yuan, and the rest also rose by 34 cents to 78 cents. The trend was that the rebound was too fast, and the prospects could not be considered too optimistic. The total number of transactions was 8,926,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot goods, and 3,435,000 in futures, including consolidated salt tax. Demobilization bonds accounted for 1,460,000 yuan, 19 customs duties accounted for 660,000 yuan, 20 shares and 20 customs duties accounted for 1,150,100 yuan, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 350,000 yuan. Trading in November futures contracts will be added today.</p>
<h3>The New York Stock Market is Still Not Stable</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that on the 26th, the New York stock market declined due to falling grain prices, which promoted speculative selling. However, the quantity was not large, and the future still showed an unstable trend. The total number of shares traded for the day was 1,430,000. The (wheat) market declined entirely due to speculators selling spot goods, but sales were very good. Talk of inflation has gradually subsided. The May futures market is still good, and the spot situation is quite good, so the value can be seen as high. It is said that the (cotton) political loan proposal can be applied to any request. There has been very little selling from the south, and the loan plan has increased good understanding. Rumors of stabilizing the currency have also been heard occasionally. (Silver) The market has no definite trend. Here are the Dow Jones Index numbers: closing prices compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 97.41 down 0.6220 Railroad Stocks 43.11 also down 0.4020 Utility Stocks 25.98 also down 0.2740 Bonds 84.44 also down 0.11</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton, Yarn and Cotton are in an Unstable State</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the situation was still softening. Because the environment was temporarily difficult to improve, and military chaos was occurring all the way through North China, people felt particularly anxious. Businessmen were deeply affected. However, a certain large bull was struggling to collect goods, and the market was tightened by him. However, the overall trend was not good, and it was difficult to rise. This month was the last day, and the bulls did their best to collect goods. The last session was 179.5 yuan, which was 2.5 yuan higher than the previous month's price.</p>
<p>(Tenders Vary) In the morning session of the tender market, the market fell slightly, but when the bidding reached the second and third sessions, it was rumored that the bull in the current month was prepared to collect goods, and people's confidence was boosted. Prices for each month rose by 5678 cents compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, the current month entered the 80-yuan mark again, and prices for each month fell by 3469 cents as those who wanted to profit sold. The total number of transactions for the day was 48,400 bales. It was found that Changfeng sold 3,900 bales, Yiyu 900 bales, Tongfu 850 bales, and Dafeng 800 bales, and Taixing 750 bales. Taichang bought 1,800 bales, Yiyu 1,400 bales, Yichang 750 bales, Renfeng 750 bales, Chunjin 700 bales, and Minghua 750 bales. The closing price is as follows:</p>
<p>Tender Closing Increase/Decrease Account Balance December 1843 up 565,200 September 1795 down 317,600 January 1850,274,100 October 1814,61,650 February 1858,341,090 November 1831 up 371,000 Total 530,600</p>
<p>(Yarn Sales 1,010 Bales) More spot yarn was sold today than yesterday. It was found that the total number of bales purchased by each gang for the day was 1,010. The market was similar to the previous day. The purchase amount for each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 350 Inland 55 North Gang 5 Shantou 20 Fujian 10 Changsha 85 Yunnan 460 Zhenjiang 100 Anqing 15 Fellow Merchants 2</p>
<p>The cotton market was slightly tired because the overseas cotton market was average, and the yarn market was heavily burdened. Factory inventories were sluggish, and because the price of cotton was more expensive than the price of yarn, some people were inclined to short when prices rose. As for general cotton merchants, they were discussing that the price of foreign cotton was higher in the past week, making it impossible to import. In addition, the domestic climate was humid, which greatly affected new cotton. It was still difficult to pass through the price of each slightly producing area. The cotton stored in each Shanghai warehouse was exhausted. There was a strong intention to absorb it for this reason, and the market was tightened. The market therefore fluctuated.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Contained Dew and a Soft Trend) In the morning session of the Zheng Biao market, the price of foreign cotton was average, and the market price did not rise or fall much. It was close to being flat, and the far term rose by 5 to 10 cents. In the afternoon, the current month fell by 20 to 15 cents, and the far term fell by 10 cents. However, large households continued to buy and increase their positions. The total number of transactions for the day was 80,700 dan. It was found that Renfeng sold 5,200 dan, Xincheng 3,100 dan, Yiyu 2,300 dan, Dachang 2,700 dan, Taixing 3,900 dan, and Yuande 2,600 dan. Tongji bought 3,600 dan, Yuanda 3,600 dan, Jifeng 2,400 dan, Yuanxingchang 2,700 dan, and Taichang 1,800 dan. The closing price is as follows: Zheng Biao Closing Increase/Decrease Account Balance January 4080,202,300 October 4150 down 252,34,200 February 4090,152,800 November 4075,522,35,500 Total 1,034,700 December 4070,102,21,900</p>
<p>(Factory Demand is Not Bad) The current demand for cotton is still good, and foreign merchants are more diligent in purchasing. The sources are 3,645 bales of Yao Hua cotton and 774 bales of Tongzhou cotton.</p>
<p>Hankou fine velvet 40.90 Rishengxing entered 600 bales. Chen Luoyang from October and November will be delivered to the warehouse 47.75 Hongzhang Factory entered 270 pieces. Spot goods will be sent to the factory. Shaanxi cotton 41.65 Hongzhang Factory entered 290 pieces. Spot goods will be sent to the factory. Shaanxi cotton 42.00 Baoxing Factory entered 100 pieces. Spot goods will be sent to the factory.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Markets Decline Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market was mixed. It first fell due to bulls closing positions, and then rebounded due to traders buying, but the result was that spot goods remained unchanged and futures fell by 4 to 7 points per pound. Liverpool spot cotton fell by 4 points, and futures fell by 12 points. Egyptian spot cotton fell by 8 points. The Bombay cotton cloth market first fell due to speculators selling and bulls closing positions, and then rebounded due to Japanese merchants and brokers buying. The result was that Pinggar fell by 2 rupees and 2.5 cents, Olmula fell by 4 rupees and 2.5 cents, and Bairuo Creek fell by 3 rupees and 2.5 cents. The original telegram records are on the left.

<h3>Grain from the River's Lower Reaches, Rice's Declining Trend is Difficult to Reverse</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were nearly 40 sources of grain from the river's lower reaches. After the market suddenly declined yesterday afternoon, it continued to soften today. Due to the relationship between the climate and the current situation, people's hearts are floating and unstable. Both local and foreign inventories are sluggish. There were only a little over 1,000 packages of both sticky rice and sharp rice. The prices of each gang's thick sticky rice, white broken rice, thin rice, and old Duyang sharp rice have continued to decline by a corner or so. The price of new sticky rice from the river's lower reaches has dropped by two corners. Fragrant sticky rice has also been devalued accordingly. Bianyuan rice is lacking goods and there is no market. The price of new Yin Yuan rice has dropped by a corner or so.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 30 sources of grain from the river's lower reaches. The sales of each type of grain in the market were sluggish in the morning, and slightly improved in the afternoon for white broken rice, new western sticky rice, new Yangjian rice, and Bujian rice at small numbers of points. The price of thin rice, Baiyuan rice, new and old Dujian rice, old Yangjian rice, and eastern new sticky rice did not rise or fall much.</p>
<h3>The Leading Source of Early Indica Rice is Looking Good</h3>
<p>— Talk of Organized Sales Mechanisms for Hunan Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for early indica rice continued to look good. However, the Guangdong gangs stopped buying, and the source was attracted by the price increase, and the rising wind slightly frustrated. However, the buying from the Fuzhou and Quanzhou gangs was still active, and the appetite of the Ningbo gang was also strong. The market was still lively, and the middle and second grades were slightly in demand. The market still showed signs of growth due to the lively trading of guest rice. However, the source will probably gradually see more in the future. Hunan has a very thick reserve, and the local authorities and rice merchants have jointly formed a sales organization, intending to transport the province's inventory directly to various ports in Southeast Asia, the Pingjin area, and Shanghai. If the market price rises slightly in the future, there will be a risk of surges. In addition, Hubei has a surplus for its own use, and Shashi machine rice has been loaded onto ships. The production of this province's Jiangbei is also abundant, so it is difficult to expect the market to rise sharply in the future. Fortunately, there are already outlets in Guangdong and Fujian, so it will not be easy to see a sharp decline again. Yesterday, 1,694 packages of Hunan rice, 86 packages of Shashi machine rice, 550 packages of Nanjing indica rice, and 1,000 packages of Wuxi Yangjian rice were sold. Half of it was purchased by Ningbo, and the rest was divided by Quanzhou and Fuzhou in Fujian Province. The market was similar to yesterday, and the price varied slightly depending on the difference in quality.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Initially Flat, then Fell</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the market opened in the morning, the prices of each month's flour showed signs of initially being flat and then falling. Because the reported price of foreign wheat was that Chicago was down 67 cents and Canada was down about 8 cents, although people's confidence was still flat when the price opened, the actual sales gangs in the north remained silent, resulting in a lack of buying interest, and the market gradually declined. Afterwards, due to the slight selling from manufacturers, the market gradually declined. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the price for the current month was still flat, while the prices for the far-term months were declining step by step. It was rumored that the reported price of No. 3 foreign wheat was only about 4.4 yuan. This situation is a major shock at present. Domestic goods have become sluggish and excessive, and foreign countries will take the opportunity to dump goods, so it is feared that the future in the downturn will inevitably fall into a more desperate situation. In the afternoon, all large and small factories were selling, but there were not many transactions and little was sold. As a result, the current month was down 1.5 cents, October was down 1.7 cents, November was down 2.2 cents, December was down 2 cents, January was down 2.2 cents, and February was down 2.5 cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Futures Fell, Spot Rose</h3>
<p>The wheat market yesterday was generally flat. The reported price of foreign wheat was that Chicago was down 67 cents and Canada was down 8 cents, so after the price opened, the market was stable. In addition, the situation in North China was deteriorating, and future flour sales would be hit, so there was even less hope for the wheat market. In the afternoon, the flour market declined again, and people's hearts were even more scattered. If the rumors about Australian wheat are true, then the far-term impact may be inevitable. As a result, the October and November contracts were down 3 cents each, December was down 2 cents, and January was down 4 cents.</p>
<p>Spot wheat inventories are gradually decreasing, and not many new arrivals are coming. Because production prices are high, and transportation is not cost-effective, the consigners' minds are very strong. They continue to call for higher prices for goods above the middle grade. Each rose by 35 cents yesterday. Yaowan wheat was opened at 4 yuan, Jiangyan Gaoyou wheat was opened at 3.81 yuan, Baoying was 3.8 yuan, Yangzhou was 3.75 yuan, Wuxi was 3.7 yuan, Liuhe was 3.69 yuan, and Deqiao was 3.66 yuan. A total of 5,000 packages were purchased by Fuxin and Xinda.</p>
<h3>Raw Oil Fell by 56 Cents</h3>
<p>Recently, peanut oil has seen a thin sales channel and relaxed production prices, resulting in an unstable market mood. Oil that arrived recently began to be sold yesterday afternoon, including 150 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, priced at 13.7 yuan, down 9 cents from the previous market. 500 pieces of Jiacang oil were opened, priced at 14.2 yuan, also down 5 cents. 230 pieces of Boer oil were opened, priced at 14.4 yuan, down 6 cents. The situation will remain that there will be more humiliation than glory.</p>
<h3>Sesame's Declining Trend Reappears</h3>
<p>— New Peanut Kernels Continue to Open at the Original Price —</p>
<p>Although the sesame market is busy with transactions, only dozens of packages are purchased in fragments, so when goods are surging, they cannot be sold without depreciation. Therefore, the market fell again by 34 cents yesterday. A total of 403 packages of new and old sesame were traded, and there were indeed six types of goods. The second batch of new peanuts and raw kernels has arrived, but the number is small, with only 10 packages of Yantai peanuts and 22 packages of Qingdao raw kernels, which is not enough to meet the demand, so the selling price is still kept at the original price.</p>
<h3>The Silk and Tea Foreign Firms’ Silk Sales Fall into Desperate Situation</h3>
<p>(Jin Tan Autumn Cocoons Reeled with Less Loss) The model district of Jin Tan has had a better harvest of autumn silkworms this year. The cocoon yield is also more abundant than that of Li Yang, with thick and high-quality cocoons that reel with less loss. On average, 700 catties of dried autumn cocoons from Yi Xing and Li Yang are needed to reel 100 catties of silk, while Jin Tan only needs 550 catties. It is a pity that the price of cocoons is not low, and each bale of raw silk still requires a strong 600 yuan.</p>
<p>(China Silk Shipped to America Almost at the End of Its Rope) The American postal ship, President Grant, exported yesterday. Only 80 pieces of China silk from local firms like Blue and Co. were shipped to Seattle.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Sales to Customers Still Sparse) The demand for artificial silk in the mainland is weak, and sales to customers remain sparse. Yesterday, only 18 cases of Hong Lan, Golden Bell, and Five Star brands were imported by various silk factories in the local area, with prices ranging from 180 yuan, 7 jiao and a half to 165 jiao net.</p>
<p>(China Silk Sales to America Hard to See a Turnaround) The labor strikes in American silk weaving factories are difficult to resolve in the short term. The stock of silk in New York is plentiful, and demand is weak. China silk sales to America are indeed lacking hope for a turnaround. Japanese silk is still being sold aggressively in England, France, and other places, and the prices offered by factory owners are surprisingly low. China silk merchants are suffering huge losses, making it difficult to sell. Yesterday, only Lien and Co. and Chou Men imported 25 bales of white factory silk, all at low prices, which was still a matter of replenishing empty stocks.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Slightly Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, European firms found that there were very few Zhen Mei teas from Tun Xi, She Xian, Sui An, and other routes on the market. Moreover, Zhen Mei from Wu Yuan North Road was stagnant in sales to Africa. Therefore, they all adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Only Ba Tou Zhuang, Fu Lin, Rui Chang, and other firms in the city showed a slight appetite for Gong Xi green tea of Zhen Mei from Wu Yuan East Road. Although British firms also purchased a small amount, the trade in green tea has greatly decreased compared to before.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Lacks No. 24 Coarse Sand White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw the Guan Jin continue to rise, and the stock of No. 24 coarse sand white sugar was depleted. Therefore, the association set the opening price at 22 yuan, an increase of 2 jiao, but importers still offered 21 yuan, 8 jiao, resulting in no transactions. No. 20 medium sand white sugar was at 21 yuan, 2 jiao, No. 8 and 9 aged Dutch red sugar was at 16 yuan, 5 jiao and a half. Tai Gu sugar B mark increased by 5 fen to 21 yuan, 7 jiao and a half. Zhong Hua, Guo Hua, and Zhen Ji cotton white sugar all opened at the original prices. Yesterday, 200+ packages of Chao Qing were opened, with Gao Ti Zhuang priced at 16 yuan, 1 jiao and a half, and the next grade at 16 yuan, Huang Gang Qing at 15 yuan, 7 jiao to 5 jiao and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Ji Chun Zheng Er Already Open</h3>
<p>137 Yuan</p>
<p>New Xing Hua Gui Yuan has arrived in four batches, totaling over 8,000 pieces. The opening price of Ji Chun Zheng Er has been set at 137 yuan after negotiation yesterday, with miscellaneous brands subject to refund. At the same time, more than 300 pieces of New Tong An Yuan have also arrived. According to correspondence, local prices have risen again, and this batch is expected to increase by another 5 yuan. According to telegrams, the first batch of New Gui Yuan from Quan Zhou is scheduled to be shipped from Quan Zhou on October 4th and is expected to arrive in Shen around the 7th.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Asphalt Sales Quiet, Price Drops Repeatedly</h3>
<p>No Hope of Recovery in Short Term</p>
<p>Asphalt sales are usually very lively in the autumn, as candle making will start after the summer season. However, this year, due to the extremely slow summer sales, the summer goods produced by various candle factories could not be sold out and were stocked. Therefore, the start of production was delayed again and again, and production was also reduced, resulting in an even quieter asphalt market. In previous years, there was a batch of sales after the Zhong Yuan Festival, but this autumn is similar to the off-season in summer. The oil prepared by various firms in the local area was intended for autumn candle production. Unexpectedly, sales were sluggish and less than half of previous years, causing the market to slump. However, the stocks in Jiang Zhe provinces are not too large, while the goods arriving in Han Kou this autumn, plus the stocks from summer, are no less than 30,000+ dan. With no way to sell them, people inevitably panic, and prices drop again and again. According to yesterday's correspondence, Chong Jing is only about 22 yuan per dan, Ping Jing is 21 yuan, and Ma Cheng oil is between 19 yuan. However, every soap use has ceased after autumn, relying entirely on candle making. Unfortunately, candle sales are slower than in previous years in all places, and the stocks in the Han market are also more substantial than in previous years. It is feared that there is no hope of recovery in the short term. Although the local stocks are only 2,000 to 3,000 pieces, the stagnation of the situation with the approach of the Mid-Autumn Festival is rare, and the selling price has also fallen again and again. Chong Jing is sold for 26 yuan per stone, Ping Jing for 25 yuan, and Ma Cheng for 23 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods and Raincoat Fabric Market Prices Difficult to Rally</h3>
<p>Due to the Inability to Stock Goods for Long</p>
<p>The continuous autumn rain has increased the transaction of raincoat fabrics. There is more need for this in the local area and among the Han gangs. Single-sided open-water beauty sells better than other markets. Yesterday, the old brand of No. 4026 was priced at 5 yuan, 1 jiao net. The top-grade goods were priced at 5 yuan and 5 fen, (disassembled piece, stamped return receipt), the second grade at 4 yuan, 7 jiao and a half, the third grade at 4 yuan, 1 jiao, double-sided yarn at 3 yuan, 6 jiao, wool-faced elephant skin lining at 3 yuan, 5 jiao, yarn-faced elephant skin lining at 2 yuan. The reason why the selling price cannot rise is that the elephant skin is made of rubber and glue mixture, and it is difficult to store the goods. Although there are sales channels, the industry is cutting prices and selling cheaply.</p>
<h3>Hardware English White Iron Experiences Sudden Price Fluctuations</h3>
<p>English white iron has seen a slack market recently due to few purchases from various gangs and the impact of the surge of Eastern goods. The market atmosphere has suddenly loosened, and the standard has experienced sudden price fluctuations. Although the industry is working hard to maintain prices due to the vital interest of their capital, the lack of marketing skills makes it impossible to recover. Currently, the estimated price of the 7-foot Red Bird brand is 1 yuan, 4 jiao per sheet, miscellaneous brands 1 yuan, 3 jiao and 7 fen, 6 feet 1 yuan, 2 jiao, No. 28 is 17 yuan, 4 jiao per dan, No. 26 is 16 yuan, 4 jiao, No. 24 is 15 yuan, 3 jiao and a half. Compared to the previous prices, all have decreased by 2-3 fen to 2-3 jiao. Moreover, with the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, there is no hope for improved transactions.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of New Iron Goods Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to news from foreign firms, a total of more than 40,000 dan of new iron goods, such as foreign silver corner iron, railway skin, and steel bars, were shipped from New York to Shanghai last month. It is heard that due to the loosening of the US exchange rate, local firms are still continuing to place orders.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Export Goods Fewer from the Northern Gang</h3>
<p>Yesterday's export goods included more than 430 shipments of piece goods and foreign cotton yarn to Yi Chang, and more than 250 pieces of piece goods and cotton yarn, more than 1,400 packages of sugar, more than 300 barrels of cement, more than 1,200 packages of flour to Han Kou, more than 130 pieces of foreign cotton yarn, more than 100 pieces of piece goods, more than 500 pieces of paper, more than 500 boxes of cigarettes, to various ports along the Yangtze River. Incoming goods from Chang Sha transshipped from Han Kou included 1,900 packages of rice, and 650 barrels of tung oil, more than 400 pieces of cotton machine flowers from Han Kou. In the Southern China region, only more than 1,000 pieces of local paper were shipped from Fu Zhou yesterday, and the export goods included more than 300 pieces of cotton yarn, 2,000 pieces of soybean cakes, 311 pieces of foreign iron sheets, shipped to Shan Tou. More than 100 pieces of cotton yarn and more than 10 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong. Also, more than 600 packages of rice, more than 1,400 packages of flour, more than 130 pieces of piece goods and cotton yarn, and 280 pieces of fruit were shipped to Guang Zhou. There were no export goods from the Northern China region this week because the price of flour in Tianjin was even lower than in the local city. Yesterday, only more than 1,600 packages of rice, more than 200 pieces of piece goods and foreign cotton yarn, 70 pieces of native cloth, were shipped to Tianjin, and more than 300 packages of rice, more than 80 pieces of piece goods and foreign cotton yarn, more than 200 boxes of cigarettes were shipped to Yan Tai and Wei Hai Wei.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Advocating Physical Education and Strenuous Exercise</h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>It is said that schools now earnestly promote physical education, forcing students to practice a kind of strenuous exercise in addition to regular classes, such as horizontal bars, high jumps, long-distance running, etc. If this kind of strenuous exercise cannot pass, then physical education cannot pass. Then, no matter how good your moral education and intellectual education are, you still cannot move up a grade and cannot graduate.</p>
<p>Only with a sound body can we build a sound career. This is indeed a true saying. Bookworms with weak legs are indeed not suitable for this Chinese with severe national difficulties; however, forcing students to do strenuous exercise, whether it is in line with the logic of promoting physical education, I can't help but doubt.</p>
<p>Facts are the most eloquent. During the preliminary round of the Su Zhou Games, a student from a certain school fainted on the grass while running the 10,000-meter race before reaching the finish line, and he was unconscious. If the hospital was not nearby, I really don’t know what the result would have been. A certain family's son sacrificed himself under the high jump in this Shanghai Games; when his parents received the letter, he was already in a coffin, and everything was over. There was also a student who broke his stomach pocket from the horizontal bar, and it was too late to save him when he was carried into the hospital. In addition, students who were injured and coughed up blood due to strenuous exercise are countless. However, due to the limitations of the school regulations, students have to be promoted and graduate. After recovering from illness, they have to continue to do strenuous exercise desperately.</p>
<p>I remember that Confucius taught his disciples according to their aptitude, and the courses of the university are also divided into categories; even science requires "teaching according to the individual," so how can we force students to work hard like playing tricks on this kind of strenuous exercise that is related to students' lives! Although exercise is originally to relieve frailty, the weaker the person, the more he must work hard to exercise; although the theory is sufficient, the fact is still the fact. I sincerely request that educators and school authorities do not only think that winning sports is enough to glorify the school, and also ask you to take care of the lives of the students, and do not sacrifice them for sports.</p>
<h3>Foot</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>The abbreviation of feet is "呎", and the abbreviation of inches is "吋". At first, I thought it was just to show the difference between Chinese inches. Later, when I read the Dong Hua Lu, all the "口" radicals were added to England and France, which gave me an idea of the intention at the time. What's the intention? Because the word "口" means surrounding, and the ancient Chinese character for "國" has the "口" as a radical, meaning that they are all outside the country and do not belong to China.</p>
<p>We can see this kind of arrogant idea everywhere in official books, so there is no need to cite examples. But how long has it been since the "口" radical was not only cancelled, but also a noble title with the character "大" added? We can hear this everywhere in Shanghai, especially for England, such as "大英地界" (Great British Territory), "大英照會" (Great British Note), and "大英皮" (Great British Leather). Sometimes even scholars and doctors can't help but say it out, which can be regarded as the opposite of extreme things.</p>
<p>Shanghai's French Concession also has the right to be given a noble title in terms of logic, so why is it only called "法蘭西地界" (French Territory)? I have also thought about this. Probably because the British have the oldest qualifications, and those compradores and servants first interacted with the British, had a master-guest relationship, and then developed a sense of love and gratitude, so they gave him a noble title.</p>
<p>America also added the "口" radical in Dong Hua Lu, but Japan did not. Probably because of the relationship of the same race, same language, co-existence, and co-prosperity? The only relic that can be found now is "囒嗬" water.</p>
<p>Dictionaries include "呎", "吋", "哩", "噸", "咖啡", and "嗎啡" in the "口" radical. I think it should be included in the "口" radical. If you say that there are no characters in the "口" radical that use "口" as a radical, then it makes no sense to include it in the "口" radical. If you say it's for transliteration, then "呎", "吋", and "哩" are ideographic, not phonetic.</p>
<p>I'm not confident in this view, and I still need to ask erudite gentlemen for advice!</p>
<h3>Picking up Fragments from Zheng Shi Middle School</h3>
<p>— Shi Zheng Hong</p>
<p>I often hear people say that the current academic atmosphere is extremely bad. To say it bluntly, there are no good students in modern times. I think it is not that there are no good students in modern times, but that there are no good schools, and it is not that there are no good schools, but that there are no good talents who sincerely run schools. Mr. Du Yue Sheng, the founder of Zheng Shi, and Mr. Chen Qun, the principal, are really people who sincerely run schools. Mr. Du declared: "I lost my schooling in my childhood, and I have been serving the society since then. I deeply feel the necessity of reading...". His starting point for running the school is naturally different from other school runners. Therefore, Zheng Shi has only been established for two years, and it has already spent more than 80,000 gold, which is indeed an amazing thing. Speaking of talents, such as Dean of Education Yu Xiang Sen and Dean of Discipline Chen Ji Hu, both have 20-30 years of educational experience, and the teachers hired are mostly the best of the time. Therefore, Zheng Shi has become a good school because there are talents who sincerely run the school, and it has taught many good students. Because the authorities of Zheng Shi advocate seeking truth from facts and do not emphasize publicity, I only record more interesting things. As for the overall teaching implementation and performance, I will leave it to those who care about education to observe directly.</p>
<p>(1) Do Not Speak While Eating In the huge dining hall, there are about 300 people sitting, just moving their chopsticks like the wind, burying their heads in eating, and there is absolutely no sound of talking. They can really achieve the creed of Confucius, "Do not speak while eating". At the same time, you can see how their discipline is in these places.</p>
<p>(2) Guests Outside the Door There was an interesting story about the library. One day in the autumn of last year, a passerby walked outside the school and heard the sound of reading. He stopped and just wandered outside the school gate. He happened to be seen by Dean Chen of Discipline, who immediately invited him in and watched the whole school, praising it. He said to Mr. Chen: "Your school's students can really read sincerely." After he left, he asked Mr. Lu Zhu Shuang of Suzhou to send his regards to Chairman Du, and he was willing to donate 500 gold per year to add books to the library. Only then did he know that the guest's name was Gao Geng Sheng, a native of Su Zhou, and an overseas Chinese who had studied in Japan.</p>
<p>(3) My Head is Bald Zheng Shi students are extremely busy with work, so they don’t have time to dress up. They have absolutely no connection with Si Dan Kang and hair growth lotion in their hair. However, long hair is also not the right thing. Therefore, Principal Chen issued a special shaving order and limited one week to complete it. However, within three days, all the teachers and students of the school had shaved their heads. A student recorded the following words in his daily diary in the school: "The autumn sun is bright, and the shadow is on the ground. My head is bald." The words are very beautiful and meaningful.</p>
<p>(4) Special Mark This time I went to visit. There was a football game on the sports field, so I watched from the sidelines. Dean Chen of Discipline pointed out to me: "Those are our people, and this is the team from a certain school." I smiled and replied: "I see that the ones with the monk heads are your school's students." They laughed together. This is indeed a special mark for Zheng Shi students.</p>
<h3>Reed Catkin Boat</h3>
<p>— Huo Xue Ming</p>
<p>A burst of white wind shook the water surface. Small dragonflies comfortably flapped their thin wings and flew from the velvet barrier of reeds to the blue sky. The reed stalks on the shore trembled passively, and a few fluffy falling flowers covered the duckweed clumps in the shallow shoals. At the moment when a few flowers were falling in the space, they were suddenly carried away by the swallows flying across the river. The time was so quiet that I felt a kind of unspeakable lightness. This seemed like the realm of hearing the orioles sing in the willow shade in the deep mountains.</p>
<p>Man Li and I looked at each other silently, our faces filled with smiles, but our hearts were so calm that we were drunk in the silent music of autumn.</p>
<p>A boat came from Xi Xi, the embankment was full of rustling autumn sounds, and the eyes were full of white cold colors. Just because the sun was very good, the water was so clear, and the sky was so high and refreshing, the feeling of autumn did not have a chance to invade our hearts. Man Li and I were each wearing black clothes, dotted in such a silver curtain, we were so quietly exquisite. If there is really a land of ultimate bliss in the world, I am afraid it is here.</p>
<p>"If I were Chi Yi Zi Pi, you would have to be Xi Shi!" I approached her shoulder and said softly:</p>
<p>Although this metaphor is unavoidable.</p>
<p>"This is not the vast Five Lakes, but a shallow water with reeds and reeds. You should be Wu Zi Xu, who was driven away by King Fu Chai!" She said and smiled.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's fine, too. Let the wind blow the boat of life. When we are so poor that we have a green face, we will meet a fisherman."</p>
<p>"Lu Zhong Ren! Lu Zhong Ren!" She stroked my hair and called like this.</p>
<p>"Oh, my confidante! You treat me so well!"</p>
<p>Then, our hands clasped each other tightly. The boatman was making tea in the bow, and there was no sound at all, only the reed catkins quietly flew down piece by piece.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of Northeast China</h3>
<p>— Zhang Hen Shui</p>
<p>Chapter 16 Sad and Bitter Feelings, Still Blessing Before Him, Busy Military Affairs, Secretly Moving the Army</p>
<p>Casually raised his head, he saw a cloth flag hanging under the eaves of the milk tea shop, fluttering in the air. A wooden frame was placed at the door, with a large copper kettle on it. Just looking at the spout of the kettle, the hot air was spraying outwards in bursts, he associated it with the situation of hot water making lotus root powder, so he tapped his foot on the car board twice and said: Stop, I'm going in to eat something. Although Zhang San stopped the car, he was thinking in his heart, could it be that the second master has a digestive insect in his stomach? He had just come out of the restaurant, why is he going in to eat snacks at this time? However, the shopkeeper of the milk tea shop was already smiling and welcoming Ji Zhi. He said: Hey! Long time no see, Second Master, where are you making a fortune? Ji Zhi nodded and walked to a seat to sit down. The shopkeeper said: Second Master, why don't you go to the elegant seat? The elegant seat is empty now. Ji Zhi smiled and said: You still remember that I used to go to the elegant seat often. The shopkeeper also smiled and nodded. Ji Zhi said: Brew me a cup of hot coffee to drink, I ate greasy things, and my stomach should be rinsed. The shopkeeper said: I know you were drinking there. Ji Zhi said: That's strange, you know where I was drinking. Tell me and listen to see if what you say is right. The shopkeeper said: I heard that the old girl of the Yang family will have a big engagement in these few days, maybe you are here to congratulate her. You and her... Her old lady is not bad. As soon as the shopkeeper said these words, he felt that they were a bit presumptuous, so he smiled and shrugged his shoulders twice. Although Ji Zhi felt that his words were close to presumptuous, this was the fact, and there was no way to deny it, so he could only smile slightly and deal with it. The shopkeeper went to the kitchen to get coffee and diverted the topic. Ji Zhi was sitting alone in the seat thinking, unexpectedly, Company Commander Zhao really married Gui Zhi and kept me in the dark. Looking at it this way, no woman does not admire vanity. (199)</p>
<p>World News</p>
<h3>Number of Opium Addicts in the United States and Germany</h3>
<p>Dr. Bauer Walf, a pharmaceutical technician who recently returned to Germany from the United States, reported his observations to the German Medical Association. He said: The number of opium addicts in the United States is more than 100,000 and less than 150,000, while in Germany it is more than 4,000 and less than 6,000. That is, on average, the number of opium addicts in the United States is about 25 times that of Germany. As for China, there are almost 8 million people, so China's weakness is sufficient to be expressed in this number.</p>
<h3>Skeletons from Three Thousand Years Ago</h3>
<p>Recently, many skeletons have been found in a cave in Mount Etna near the city of Perugia, Italy. Among these skeletons, there are the most men, women, and children, about 70 in total. After the investigation by Professor Nela Piki Ajani, an Italian anthropologist, they are all from three thousand years ago, that is, the skeletons of the races who lived on the peninsula before the Romans moved to Italy. That cave was their place of residence.</p>
<h3>Demographics of Numbers</h3>
<p>The total population of the world now is about 2 billion people. Among them, Christians have 700 million, accounting for the first place in the world. Among Christians, Catholics account for 330 million, Protestants account for 230 million, Orthodox Christians account for 145 million, and Jews account for 17 million. Followed by Buddhists, with 570 million, Hindus with 240 million, and Muslims with 220 million. Others, such as pagans, have 270 million. Pagans mostly live in the wilderness areas of Africa, South America, and Australia, as well as in the cloud-covered Guizhou and other places in China. If classified by the number of languages, there are 430 million people who speak Chinese, 220 million who speak English, 170 million who speak Russian, 100 million who speak German, 75 million who speak French, 65 million who speak Spanish, 40 million who speak Italian, 60 million who speak Japanese, 35 million who speak Malay, 30 million who speak Portuguese, 13 million who speak Scandinavian languages, 12 million who speak Dutch, 8 million who speak Greek, 6 million who speak Arabic, and 275 million who speak Hindustani. Among these spoken languages, Chinese is the most powerful and complex. Furthermore, from the classification of races, the world is roughly divided into three types: yellow, white, and black (the red and blue colors have been eliminated). There are 950 million white people, 550 million yellow people, and the rest are black people.</p>
<h3>Gold Producing Regions of the World</h3>
<p>The Transvaal region of the Union of South Africa accounts for more than 50% of the world's total gold production. The amount of gold produced in August this year exceeded the previous record, that is, the pure gold produced in one month was 991,000 ounces. These gold sources are alluvial gold from ancient times, mixed with sand and gravel, and solidified in the strata, stretching about 130 miles east-west and about 40 miles north-south.</p>
<h3>British Civil Aviation</h3>
<p>There were a total of 15 accidents in the British civil aviation industry last year. However, most of these accidents were due to the fact that the operators were amateurs, but passenger planes have never had accidents that injured people. The total flight distance last year reached 1,276,900 miles, and 2,250,000 pieces of airmail were flown. There are currently 32 flying clubs in the UK, with 9,000 members, of which 1,573 have aviation licenses.</p>
<h3>Living Conditions of Germans</h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>According to the statistics released by the Berlin Cabinet Statistics Bureau, the total population of Germany three years ago was 65.3 million. The investigation of their living conditions showed the amount of consumer goods consumed by each person in a year: 17 gallons of beer, 2 gallons of wine, half a gallon of strong liquor, 408 cigarettes, 72 cigars, 1,900 matches for smoking, and for food: 154 pounds of bread, 107 pounds of meat, 770 pounds of potatoes, 33 pounds of fruit, and 22 pounds of butter. In the two items of smoking and drinking in these figures, the categories have gradually decreased in recent years. This is due to the improvement of health awareness of half of the people and the economic difficulties of the people.</p>

<h3>The Culture Created by Odd-Job Men</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>About two thousand years ago, the Latin satirical poet Juvenal said: "In the struggle for survival, the meaning of life is lost."</p>
<p>How sad these words are!</p>
<p>For those who participate in any career, their efforts, if they must be solely for the sake of survival, not only will the meaning of life be lost, but their career will also suffer greatly, devaluing its worth. Among those engaged in writing, this fact exists even more tragically today.</p>
<p>If someone were to investigate and statistically analyze the authors and translators who write for various publications (if this were possible), it would be seen that the absolute majority are writing and translating solely for稿費 (稿費 refers to payment for articles, manuscripts, or translations). Moreover, because their goal is 稿費, the types and nature of their manuscripts are often extremely diverse. One person may write novels and poems, translate papers on international politics and economics, write commentaries on socialism, and introduce autocratic politics, as well as all sorts of science stories, cultural issues... Any publication that offers 稿費, these kinds of writers can supply the necessary manuscripts. The outlet for these manuscripts is mostly domestic "雜誌 (magazines)", while the source is foreign "雜誌 (magazines)". Therefore, these writers are "odd-job men", like the "degraded people" of Shaoxing, helping with weddings in the east and weddings in the west, as long as there is "paper-wrapped money".</p>
<p>The works and translations produced by these writers constitute a large part of the "cultural achievements" of modern China.</p>
<p>However, these writers are ultimately different from the "degraded people". The odd jobs of the "degraded people" are a traditional and formal occupation. They have no hope of achieving any other profession. But the young people who do odd jobs in the cultural world mostly harbor a grand vision when they enter the cultural world. They select a job that suits their mental and physical strength, striving to achieve specialized accomplishments. However, in this kind of society, eating is already the first difficult thing, let alone having the leisure to deeply cultivate a skill. Thus, these young people can only become "degraded people", living by doing "odd jobs".</p>
<p>Besides the odd-job men, although few in number, there are also "experts". They are either university professors, or editors of publishing houses, or have even better positions, not relying on magazine 稿費 for a living. They should have specialized research, acting as the backbone of our cultural world, right? However, the reality is not like this. Our experts still live by doing odd jobs. They often act as international political experts, Chinese social history experts, Chinese literary history experts, education experts, translation experts, and so on... Just like the titles of popular political figures, too numerous to list. What distinguishes them from another kind of odd-job man is that manuscripts do not need to be "submitted", someone will solicit them, the 稿費 is higher, the titles are grand, they are not "degraded people", but "specialized scholars". That's all.</p>
<p>The entire Chinese culture is the "complete works library" created by these two kinds of odd-job men.</p>
<p>Being one of the "degraded people" myself, after finishing this article, I happened to see the following poem in Ding Quan's complete works: "Madly reviewing documents consumes my middle age, it is also a renewed connection in this life. I recall the extraordinary energy of my childhood, a lamp connecting to the vastness before." After reading it, I felt even more endless emotions.</p>
<h3>New Theory of Servants</h3>
<p>— Lin Lai</p>
<p>Servants are by-products of a class society. Initially, they belong to the middle class, neither high nor low. Because their foundation is unstable, they inevitably drift. The result of this drifting is being absorbed by the upper class. The reason they can obtain this benefit lies in their skillful use of their face and legs. We Chinese understand this principle thoroughly. For example, "奴顏婢膝 (servile face and bent knees)" means that servants are accustomed to using effort on their face and legs. The effort on the face must reach the point where, even if the master slaps both cheeks, they can still smile and say, "Master! Be careful of your hand, don't hurt yourself!" The effort on the legs must reach the point where they can bend and stretch, meaning that when running errands, they are stiff and straight, but when turning around to see the master, they are soft and bent. This is a consistent pattern throughout ancient and modern times, although there are slight differences due to the depth of effort. For example, we Chinese have uniquely reached the highest level, but this still does not detract from the scientific nature of the formula.</p>
<p>But are servants really as worthless as everyone despises? Are servants really fools?</p>
<p>Servants themselves have a consistent plan. "Servant" is merely a means to achieve a goal, in other words, a method, a strategy. Within it lies the great truth that "happiness must be exchanged for the greatest pain". Moreover, to become a successful servant requires at least a minimum of talent! Therefore, servants are definitely not fools.</p>
<p>When climbing upwards, servants are unwilling to reveal their secrets, and this is reasonable because they cannot guarantee that they will not fall halfway. After climbing up, they still keep it secret, and this is also reasonable because they are already the master. From then on, they will use servants in the same way. Why is it that even though it is an open secret, they are ultimately unwilling to reveal it themselves? This is probably due to wanting to escape the enemy's sight or being a little afraid of slapping their own face. Therefore, among those who despise and scold servants, there are also servants, so servants are not fools.</p>
<p>The master certainly has the right to scold "servant", but this good fortune will not last long!</p>
<p>As for the enemies of servants, they not only do not regard servants as fools, but they also know from experience that servants are more terrifying than masters because servants are best at putting on various different faces and performing various different tricks.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Tianma</p>
<p>4.  Words of a Hometown Person</p>
<p>After the ship passed Nanjing, I accidentally discovered my hometown accent by the ship's railing. It was a middle-aged couple chatting about the scenery of different places. Because I had been away from my hometown for nearly ten years, a kind of homesickness immediately made me feel particularly interested in the hometown accent. I was eager to know some news about my hometown, so with joy and surprise, I hurried over to chat with them.</p>
<p>After exchanging names, we began to talk about the recent situation of our hometown. Needless to say, the world is full of vicissitudes, and my hometown was no longer the hometown in my memory. The old people of the past have now passed away, while the childhood companions are now mostly characters active on the small political stage of the hometown. Ten years of separation suddenly became a lifetime apart. Life is like a dream, and the passing is like this. After listening to the report of that hometown person, looking at the滔滔 (turbulent) river, a nameless melancholy made me speechless for a long time.</p>
<p>What surprised me the most was the speed of the economic bankruptcy of my hometown and the繁 (burdensome) exploitation by the government. It is said that the highest price of each担 (dan, a unit of weight) of grain in my hometown is now only worth one dollar and two 角 (jiao, a unit of currency), and other by-products such as tea, wheat, and wood are even cheaper beyond our imagination. Regardless of whether it is a bumper harvest or a poor harvest, the average tenant farmers and hired farmers are certainly in a daily state of hunger and cold, and the average small and medium landlords and rich farmers are also overwhelmed and running madly on the road to bankruptcy. The common phenomenon is that there is land but no one to cultivate it, and there are goods but no one to buy them. Good land is allowed to be deserted, and everyone can only endure the lingering of hunger and cold with a frown and helplessness.</p>
<p>However, the government's squeeze has not been reduced in the slightest due to the bankruptcy of the countryside. The附加 (additional) land tax has exceeded the正費 (regular tax) by more than ten times, that is, for every two units of land tax, in addition to the正費 (regular tax), an additional tax of more than forty yuan must be paid. In addition, there are团防捐 (local defense tax), 剿匪捐 (bandit suppression tax), and even the so-called良民捐 (good citizen tax). Recently, they have levied a救國捐 (national salvation tax) of five million, which is摊派 (apportioned) to the counties, with a deadline for payment. If there is a slight delay, they will be arrested and charged with resisting taxes.</p>
<p>Every ordinary village is編有 (organized) with a壮丁队 (able-bodied men's team), which must be ready to assemble at any time, and the保甲法 (bao-jia system) is strictly enforced. The purpose, of course, is to prevent "bandits". As for towns, five households are jointly guaranteed. If one household commits a crime, the other four households are punished together. Every night, when it is late and quiet, a sudden curfew is imposed, and every household is searched with weapons. The whole family, young and old, stand like swans, obediently undergoing inspection. If a guest happens to come and has not been reported, they will be arrested. Therefore, the average people are not only suffering from hunger and cold, but also cannot get a night's sleep.</p>
<p>However, bandits have not been eliminated due to such thorough defense and strict suppression. On the contrary, they are spreading like wildfire. Not to mention large groups of "bandits", but also villains who kidnap and extort are everywhere. It is said that in a certain place in my hometown, two beggars were納凉 (cooling off) under the蔭下 (shade) of a dilapidated temple, and chatted about bandits. Beggar A said, "Since we have nothing of value, we can be considered not afraid of them visiting." In other words, both of them were complacent and clapped their hands and laughed. But that night, several good men walked into the dilapidated temple, tied them up, and took them to a butcher shop, saying that they had two fat pigs to sell to them. If they did not accept, they would use their slaughter bench to butcher them. As a result, the butcher shop paid more than ten yuan, and the two beggars were already frightened. Before leaving, the good men laughed and asked the beggars, "Are you afraid of us visiting?" This one example is enough to imagine the chaotic and desolate state of my hometown, and the people's misery!</p>
<p>In short, the hometown I haven't seen for ten years has changed its face with the passing time. The old peasant paradise with fragrant flowers and birds has now become a tragic hell.</p>
<h3>In a Third-Class Carriage (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ba Jin</p>
<p>Usually, when friends are together, everyone has a lot to talk about. At this time, we were sitting face to face, but I felt that talking was not an easy thing. We let time pass in silence, and then Mr. and Mrs. V got off the train. Then M also got off the train. Then the wheels of the train started to sound. I knew that my journey had begun again, and at this time, I felt a little nostalgic for Shanghai.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there were more people in the carriage, and my bedding was forced to roll up. Sleeping became a distant dream. That night, I混糊塗 (confusedly) spent the night in the crowd. A passenger across from me kept the window open all night, and the wind blew on me, and coal ash filled my face, making my eyes unable to open. Only I knew the bitterness, but it finally passed.</p>
<p>The next day, before eight o'clock, the train arrived at the Nanjing riverside. It was raining at that time. The morning air was very cold. But I had to follow the crowd off the train, braving the rain to walk to the ferry by the river, crowding in the front cabin, covered by a canvas canopy.</p>
<p>As soon as the small steamship started, the wind became stronger and blew all the raindrops on me. I had to turn around, but a pair of pants got wet. If my friends saw this embarrassing situation, it would surely cause them to laugh.</p>
<p>When I arrived at Pukou and entered the platform, I couldn't find the train. I stood on the platform and only felt cold. After some awkward moments, I finally saw the train coming. The platform suddenly became lively. After a rush, I entered the third-class carriage, found a good seat inside, and sat down with relief. The藤包 (rattan bag) was placed on the shelf above my head. I spread out the bedding on this long chair again. I should spend a night in this carriage (To be continued).</p>
<h3>The Passionate Child</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gomang and Zuo Zhuying</p>
<p>- Love is sweet, first love is even sweeter.</p>
<p>The orphan Luo Zhe was raised by his aunt, an old maid tormented by disease. Since encountering some misfortunes, she had been living in a small and dim house on an old street in Luoan City. His elderly grandmother lived with his aunt. She loved the child in her slightly stern old-fashioned way, and most of the time, she buried herself in one of Dumas' novels, ignoring everything and almost forgetting the world. Luo Zhe's沉 (melancholy) childhood was spent among some aging souls and old objects.</p>
<p>His aunt's friend, Mrs. Kapai'er, asked him if he would be willing to go to her house to write letters for her husband on Thursdays when he didn't have school. Mr. Kapai'er used to be a maritime broker, but now he is blind, with a white beard, quite like the old God of Longevity. He lived in the Guillong Forest on the heights of Luoan, in the middle of many gardens. Luo Zhe was able to have the opportunity to escape those gloomy old streets, cross the chestnut trees on the road, and ascend to the bright place, which was indeed a pleasant thing.</p>
<p>One Sunday, which happened to be Holy Branch Festival (Paques fleuries), Luo Zhe ran to those newly opened flower paintings just illuminated by the sun. He felt his heart full of poetry. He looked back on the mountainside, and the clear blue sea was flashing blue light from between the pale red peach trees and the snow-like plum blossoms. He discovered the magnificence of the earth. He really needed youth, living among some old people! He was willing to wander in the countryside full of spring, unwilling to run to be locked in Mr. Kapai'er's house. But his aunt told him to go; he had the title of secretary, and he should fulfill his responsibilities. He felt as proud as being the secretary of the director.</p>
<p>When he went in, he prepared a speech to explain the reason for his lateness. But as soon as he entered, a burst of laughter stopped him. He felt surprised.</p>
<p>A girl, a tall and dazzling girl stood there looking at him very playfully. She stretched out her hand to him: How are you, master Roger? She laughed again: "Because you always understand English, Mr. Secretary?" He stuttered: Quite Well, thank you</p>
<p>All the scenery in April followed her in; some flowers were scattered on her lace-trimmed robe, and in a blue vase near the window, a few daffodils were blooming for her. He smiled, and when he spoke, he had an eloquence that he had never had before. He accompanied her in the garden. In the scent of raspberries, he talked about his studies. He narrated with a refined and boastful joy the procession of the Minerve goddess festival held in Athens. She looked at him, interested and surprised by what he said: Does this provincial boy really know these things!</p>
<p>When he went home, he was very happy, showing a bit of fanaticism, and excitedly told his aunt about his experience of the day. "Okay, be quiet! Go do your homework!" A faint smile slipped across the patient's haggard face.</p>
<p>That day, he did not write a letter for Mr. Kapai'er. Mr. Kapai'er said to him: "Come again tomorrow after class: but don't make trouble on the road like you did today, little thing!"</p>
<p>The next day, after school, he ran up the heights in one breath. Miss Baide was there, wearing another beautiful dress. He couldn't say why that outfit made him feel beautiful: undoubtedly, it was the girl herself who made the pearly gray silk shirt so noble. She was from Paris; she brought the mystery and mysterious fragrance of the big city that he had never seen. He looked very restrainedly at the clumsy shoes on his feet. Suddenly, he felt that he was dressed like a poor boy. He stared at her, she was leaning down to look at a collection of sculptures, and he also bent down; those fingers wearing rings showed a flash of light when turning the pages of the album; the pale golden hair slightly brushed his whiskers, and he felt very happy.</p>
<p>He looked at her eyes; her eyes were neither as blue as those described in the stories, nor did they appear gloomy. Her eyes were gray, but he had never seen eyes so beautiful, so big, so gentle, so velvety. Her eyes were gray, but these eyes changed and reflected the garden. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<h3>Destroying Culture and Promoting Chinese Civilization</h3>
<p>Culture is a product of humanity, and humanity is a crystallization of culture; because humanity both creates culture and is nurtured within it. Therefore, the relationship between culture and humanity is exceptionally close and important. However, culture is not created by one time, one generation, or a few people. Today's culture has been created over millions of years, expending the efforts of millions and millions of people. Later generations of humanity inherit the culture left by previous generations, and not only bear the responsibility of preserving it, but must also supplement it and pass it on to later generations of humanity. Culture is thus constantly passed down from generation to generation, accumulating into the magnificent and brilliant product of today.</p>
<p>From this perspective, culture is the most precious thing to humanity. However, unfortunately, humans who grow up in the womb of culture often do things that destroy culture. This is somewhat contrary to the norm. Whether ancient or modern, whether east or west; as recorded in history, as seen before our eyes; culture often encounters the misfortune of being destroyed. In ancient times, such as the famous tyrant Qin Shihuang in Chinese history, wasn't he a murderer who destroyed culture? He not only burned books, but also buried scholars alive. He regarded the culture of the time as simply ominous, harmful to himself, and did not hesitate to risk the great crime of the world to carry out wanton destruction. This is considered a painful record in Chinese history, and it can also be said to be a great loss for the Han nation! In recent times, such as Hitler of Germany, who was revered as a hero of the era, was also a great sinner of culture. He seemed like a demon king, fearing that the destruction of human culture would not be exhaustive; fearing that the persecution of cultural creators would not be swift. This is not only detrimental to Germany, but also the misfortune of the world!</p>
<p>Logically, humanity should cherish and promote culture; so that later generations of humanity can inherit more beautiful culture and enjoy a more comfortable life: why destroy it? If we ask Qin Shihuang and Hitler, their actions have their own great reasons for acting, or even precisely their great得意處 (proud points) and great accomplishments; but we cannot help but say that they are both destroyers of culture and enemies of humanity! Because they all act arbitrarily, violently, and recklessly; ignoring the environment, failing to observe the people's sentiments, and refusing to accept public opinion. Although, there are still many people praising their decisiveness and brilliance, and worshiping them as wise and great rulers!</p>
<p>However, there are other situations of destroying culture. For example, culture suitable for a certain time and place may not be able to pass unimpeded in another time and place; in this case, some people will rise up to reject it, eliminate it, and replace it with a new culture. Culture contains temporality. The culture that prevailed in ancient times may not necessarily be feasible in today's era; culture suitable for place A may not necessarily be suitable for place B. This kind of destruction is meaningful, it is destruction for the purpose of establishing a new culture, and it is beneficial to humanity. This is called a cultural revolution. Also, when a country undergoes a period of revolution, there are often acts of destroying culture; this is a matter of necessity, and there is much to be forgiven; moreover, the goal of a true revolution is also to transform or construct culture.</p>
<p>As for when two countries are fighting each other, or when one country invades another country, they will of course try their best to destroy the culture of the enemy country. This kind of atrocity is to try to control the enemy's life, and it is an extremely cruel act. For the sake of human culture, we must rise up and attack it and resist it!</p>
<h3>Victory Apple</h3>
<p>He wandered the streets; it was dusk.</p>
<p>Shanghai, bustling Shanghai, had already reached its peak activity. Neon lights reflected off the endless stream of cars, changing their colors. Inside the cars, the city's darlings, their radiant faces illuminated by the lights, were figures from another world, unimaginable to the anemic, blind beggar girl standing on Nanjing Road. Advertisements fluttered in the air, mingling with the scent of chestnuts roasting in large pots, evoking endless autumn memories. People – ant-like figures seen from the twenty-fourth floor – came and went, as swift as eels. The metropolis spun like a giant bullet just fired from a cannon.</p>
<p>He wandered the streets; it was dusk. He had a purplish-red face, a head tilted back from excessive alcohol stimulation as he walked. His clothes made one think of vagrants selling greasy soap, but he did not have such large hands. He was a purely yellow-skinned Chinese man.</p>
<p>He drank every day. Afu, the waiter, recognized him as a good customer. He always took out a dollar and never asked Afu for change. Although once, on the rare occasion when he ordered a very expensive dish, and Afu, after accepting the dollar, said, "Sir, you're still a few cents short," he slapped Afu. But Afu believed he was definitely a good customer. He told other patrons that the man was drunk and would thank him the next day. However, no one knew that.</p>
<p>Today, he woke up at three in the afternoon. He pulled a roll of banknotes from a dust-covered suitcase. He said to the wall, "With this, what's there to fear?" As if something urgent was waiting for him, he threw on his greasy coat and ran out.</p>
<p>On the wall was a photograph of a woman, smiling enchantingly.</p>
<p>He ran out the door, not changing his usual direction, and ended up at that same hotel. Afu greeted him with a smile, "Sir, something special today?" He looked at the clock on the wall; today, the man was an hour late.</p>
<p>He occupied his usual corner seat and, unusually, ordered that expensive dish from Afu again.</p>
<p>"Sir, we're sold out. How about something else?"</p>
<p>Afu leaned against the table, smiling as he spoke, but everyone knew it was a lie.</p>
<p>"Then how about a ××××?" he nodded,</p>
<p>naming an even more expensive dish.</p>
<p>"Sir, that... the shop doesn't have it."</p>
<p>He pulled out a roll of banknotes from his greasy coat and waved it. "Get it! It's not your business!" He abruptly stood up from his seat, pushing Afu back a couple of steps.</p>
<p>"Sir, we... we... we have it..."</p>
<p>He smiled victoriously. He drank more than usual. His head was dizzy; his upper body seemed to have gained weight, making it difficult to maintain his balance. He stood up, threw down a dollar with a loud clatter, like a drunk smashing a wine glass.</p>
<p>"Sir, three dollars, sixty-two cents," Afu stood far away, almost running away.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>He cocked his head, narrowed his triangular eyes, and after a moment, smiled to himself. He pulled out the banknotes and beckoned to Afu, waving a ten-dollar bill in his hand. Afu was overjoyed. He wrung out a hot towel and approached, but received a slap, just like last time. He smiled and ran off.</p>
<p>"Afu, he'll thank you tomorrow!" a witty patron joked.</p>
<p>He wandered the streets; it was dusk.</p>
<p>He was an exception in the swirling crowd. He raised his head, staring at the lonely autumn sky. He seemed like someone rejected by the metropolis. It had been exactly three months since the first day he came to Afu's hotel. He avoided all acquaintances, living alone in a corner of the city. His only companion was the photograph of the woman with the enchanting smile.</p>
<p>He walked, walked so slowly, and stopped in front of the entrance of a dance hall. He heard intoxicating music, like the sudden resolution of a long-unsolved problem. He straightened his greasy coat, puffed out his chest, and pushed the revolving door. This was a dance hall he often frequented. He was a skilled dancer. He could name every famous dancer in the place. He walked in. The Boy at the cloakroom asked in surprise:</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhu, hasn't your wife returned yet?"</p>
<p>"I think I'll marry another wife!" he nodded and smiled.</p>
<p>He bought many dance tickets. Like someone with an obsession, he refused to miss any of the music. He called the dancers he knew to his seat, but the dancers no longer recognized him. Finally, the Boy at the cloakroom gave a hint.</p>
<p>"Cheapskate," after the "marry another wife" reached the dancer's ears, she threw her whole body into his arms, "You're a weirdo who scares people to death!"</p>
<p>"Manli, how about being my wife?" He stroked Manli's face, while touching his own furry stubble.</p>
<p>"What about your wife?" The one called Manli glanced sideways, smiling enchantingly.</p>
<p>"My wife married a gigolo!"</p>
<p>········</p>
<p>After this negotiation, he had already seized Manli into his arms.</p>
<p>It was a luxurious bedroom, on the seventh floor of a grand hotel. He embraced Manli's body, smiling triumphantly—the only time he had smiled in three months;</p>
<p>So naturally, so happily.</p>
<p>He quickly completed the finale of his solution, quickly pushed the mass of flesh away, jumped out of bed, threw on his greasy coat, pulled out the roll of banknotes, and tossed it onto the head of the bed.</p>
<p>"Even you women have a day of surrender!"</p>
<p>Manli, in extreme excitement and exhaustion, raised her drowsy eyes. He was already gone. She lifted the covers. The banknotes covered her naked body. She laughed, gathered the banknotes, rolled over, and went back to her sweet dreams.</p>
<p>From then on, he was no longer seen wandering the streets at dusk.</p>
<h3>The City's Early Morning Because</h3>
<p>From who knows whose home, a rooster crowed, in the still autumn morning air, crisply singing the tune of "Cock-a-doodle-doo, every home is red." Ah! Another day has begun. Street cleaners by the roadside shoveled up trash, rumbling on the asphalt road. I jumped out of bed, not putting on any clothes, only a vest, shorts, slippers, and bare legs, and ran out the door. I took a deep breath in the still city's early morning air.</p>
<p>"Woo..." Ah! That was the sound of the whistle on the roof of the large factory, straight like a nose! It was urging the laborers to go to work! I ran in one breath to the end of that road, look, ah, so lively! In twos and threes, in groups, men and women, some with clothes draped on, buttons unbuttoned, some still bare-chested, gesturing and talking excitedly, laughing, some even singing… Ah, more and more, how will I get past them all? Look, over there are thirteen or fourteen-year-olds, seventeen or eighteen-year-olds, girls with braids, girls with short hair! Quite a sight. They are all carrying baskets, holding packages, and chewing flatbread in their mouths. Short, slender legs vigorously swinging, some with bitter faces, some with smiles. Yes, they are deeply afraid that today they will be eaten whole by the machine, while at the same time consoling themselves, "Today my stomach won't be in a panic."</p>
<p>Walking, passing, passing, passing a group, another team. In my heart I think, you will eventually finish walking! Haha, really, you finally finished walking, right! Ah! Ah! Over there, more are coming! Look, coming are the thin, pale, like firewood, like skeletons! Ah! Ah! How is it? Have my eyes suddenly become so blurred? What is that one dragging its two legs moving in the corner, is it also a living thing? Is he also a member of this team? This couldn’t help but make me sweat on his behalf...</p>
<p>"Woo...," ah, the nose on the roof of the big house is still calling out in a hoarse voice, its big open mouth is still not closed. I think to myself, it has already swallowed up this large group of men and women, big and small, old and young, thin and fat, smiling and bitter, so, is it not full yet? Otherwise, what is it waiting for?</p>
<p>"Cock-a-doodle-doo, every home is red," still, I don't know whose rooster is croaking in this once agitated and now still autumn morning air. Ah, another day has begun. But how is it? I don't even see the shadow of a gentleman in a top hat with a protruding belly. I wondered: Is the city's early morning only for these laborers in short clothes, bare chests, and pale faces?…</p>
<p>…I took another deep breath in the still city's early morning air.</p>

<h3>In Adverse Circumstances</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>My family's situation used to be passable. Unfortunately, my mother died, and my father married a stepmother. Unexpectedly, she treated me very harshly, forcing me to come here as an apprentice.</p>
<p>Here, every day from five in the morning until eleven at night, there is simply not a moment to sit down and rest. Such long hours of work, coupled with bad food and lodging, inevitably fills my mind with gray terror.</p>
<p>I often want to take supplementary classes, but with such work, where would I get the energy? I really can't think of a way out! Sir, you are a clear-sighted observer, perhaps you have a good method, please advise me! With respectful greetings,</p>
<p>Sincerely, Huang Bingheng</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>Editor's Note: According to the tone of Mr. Huang's letter, it seems that his father originally had the ability to further cultivate him, but due to the instigation of his stepmother, he endured letting his son come into society at a time when his physical and intellectual strength had not yet fully developed, and suffer this excessive grind. If what he says is true, then you can earnestly request your father to hope that he has a day of repentance. However, in these years, providing children with higher education is definitely not something that families below the middle class can afford. Don't you observe unclearly and wrongly blame your old father: as we see it, perhaps he sees you suffering. Maybe he is also shedding tears behind his back! In addition, when a person is in adversity, it is important to have an attitude of composure in addition to courageous struggle. Without the courage to struggle, it is enough to depress one's ambition; but if one cannot endure poverty and hardship, it will also affect one's ambition. Those who are in adverse circumstances, who make up the largest majority in the current society, should carefully review these words three times.</p>

<h3>War and Peace (35) (Four-Act Play) Ling He</h3>
<p>Act Three: Praise of Peace</p>
<p>Xueliang's non-resistance and Tang Yulin's defiance of orders were clearly all to preserve strength. Who doesn't know that foreign insults are not as bad as internal strife? During the civil war, if you wanted to preserve strength, it might have been possible, but if you fought with Japan now, you also wanted to preserve strength, then it would be like inviting thieves into the house. Isn't that a joke? That's why I said in my speech to the students in Tianjin last time: If the soldiers of today want to gain the love of the people, they must be determined to sacrifice and resolutely resist Japan. That is what the Bible says: "He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."…</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: It turns out that the Principal has a thorough understanding of the Bible.</p>
<p>Principal: Uh, the Bible is indeed a good book… So, to say something bold; now the central army's continuous retreat and active armistice, there are many people outside who are dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: Whether the people are satisfied or not is another matter. Now I only care about the facts. I ask you, in this situation, what other methods can be thought of besides armistice, besides direct negotiation? What do the common people know?</p>
<p>Principal: This can't be said like that…</p>
<p>Military Authority: I don't think we should talk about this, right?…</p>
<p>…How is Northern University doing lately? Is the school's funding sufficient?</p>
<p>Principal: Yes, it is that the school's funding is greatly insufficient, there is simply no way to do it well. In addition, in recent years, students' thinking has become increasingly radical, and there are often disturbances. Take this armistice incident, for example, as soon as they heard this rumor, radical leaflets and slogans were found everywhere in the school. You see, as long as we are not careful, there will be an uproar.</p>
<p>Military Authority: That's right, it's not easy for you people who run schools. I think you should come and help us. How about coming to us as an advisor?</p>
<p>Principal: I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare. But I am truly grateful that the Minister is willing to cultivate me like this.</p>
<p>Military Authority: It's okay, it's okay, like you are an indispensable talent for the country, in this time of internal and external troubles, the government must borrow extraordinary talents.</p>
<p>Principal: I dare not, I dare not. But in this time, the country should promote real talents, that is true. The so-called turbulent times produce heroes, for example, if the Minister were not here to personally suppress and handle everything at this time, then it would simply be an uproar. Therefore, it is said that when to make peace, then make peace, when to fight, then fight, a great man can advance and retreat, can bend and stretch, to preserve the country's vitality, and save many meaningless sacrifices, is a brilliant insight. The true color of a hero.</p>

<p>Film Special</p>
<h3>An Interview with Chinese Film Artists (4) (Continued from the 24th of This Month)</h3>
<p>— Shaji</p>
<p>(2) "Flower of Freedom" Director Zheng Zhengqiu (Part 1)</p>
<p>After the cataclysm of "September 18th," I went to Muer Ming Road in a state of quiet isolation to interview the pioneer of Chinese cinema, Zheng Zhengqiu.</p>
<p>An old-fashioned stone house; if you looked at the peeling paint on the door, you would easily recognize the age of the house. I thought that if it were located in a bustling area of the concession, it would definitely be renovated; luckily, it grew up here. Following the Shanghai custom of "please use the back door," I entered through the back door, although there was no paper strip with such words posted on the door. Stepping on the red floral tiles in the hall, I sat on the mahogany chair and waited, waited… The Zhu couplet written by Tan Yankai was in front of me. The strength of the brushstrokes was nothing special, but looking at his name always gave me a bit of chill. It turns out that great men or heroes are all very scary things. Just thinking about his high position while alive and the national mourning after his death made me feel so insignificant.</p>
<p>Afterwards, a short, thin, middle-aged man appeared before me. He wore glasses with very deep lenses; if you were to represent him in a cartoon, you would only need to draw a few more circles.</p>
<p>We were both very straightforward and didn't need the usual courtesies. After I explained my intention, we immediately got to the point. Fortunately, he was not a political giant, so there was no need for written questions and answers. The following is the gist of his conversation:</p>
<p>"I think that Chinese directors generally have two shortcomings: One, a lack of correct social awareness. That is to say, they cannot deeply appreciate and understand the world situation and the social status quo. In this way, what is expressed in their works is naturally very thin. However, this can be helped by progressive playwrights. If there is a good story, the director can still be of great help. Even during working hours, you can ask friends for help. Two, generally, they are not very particular about directing skills. In fact, there are many who, because of methodological errors, let go of the good consciousness in the script. However, this is not something that can be helped by others; you must do some real work yourself. In addition to constantly paying attention to the living conditions of various groups of people in society, you must also learn and appreciate in foreign films. Regarding this point, I am a little bit at an advantage because I have had more than ten years of stage experience. I understand the psychology of the audience, and I give the audience what they need. I believe that a director must have rich life experience and should pay attention to all the small parts of life; otherwise, it will reduce the small amount of the script." (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Her Bodyguard"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Her Bodyguard</p>
<p>If we were to give a more appropriate comment on "Her Bodyguard," it would be "Humph, this film is quite interesting." Why do we say this? Look, the story is very interesting. A wealthy man and a backstage boss are both pursuing a female actress, fighting each other and competing for her love. The wealthy man hires a bodyguard for the female actress, trying to monitor her actions. As a result, neither of them get anything, and the actress is eventually taken away by the young bodyguard.</p>
<p>Naturally, this is satirical. In the course of the play's development, the female actress is often surrounded by news reporters or backstage figures. At the same time, the wealthy men can't help but salivate, and the famous actresses are nothing more than playthings in their eyes. However, the author cherished this female actress after all, so he gave her an opportunity to meet a young and lively bodyguard. Moreover, this bodyguard is also a talented artist, so an artist matches an artist, which is just right. On the one hand, we can see the "lightness" of the story itself, and on the other hand, we can prove that American writers are really fantasizing after lacking themes, and they actually came up with such a story. (In fact, it is not that there is a lack of themes, but that they do not use the readily available themes.) So this is the American playwright being bored and funny.</p>
<p>With a light story, there must be a light performance. On this point, the director's technique is even more successful. The beginning of the play is an interesting scene. Two drunkards walk into a wine bar and fall down together, with four feet together, unable to tell which pair is their own feet. Naturally, this is in line with the word humor. In Sidney Holt's works, there has also been the same use. As for whether he learned from Sidney Holt, it is not known.</p>
<p>However, in any case, the director is good. Organized editing is of course the minimum requirement for a director, but here there is a clearer system. In addition, it is interesting, almost every scene is interesting. Especially in the train scene, when the female actress leaves with the bodyguard, the wealthy man has to hug another female actress and laugh loudly, which is really tearful.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, I think this is Edmund Lowe's unprecedented achievement. Although he doesn't have many scenes here, they are all light and lively. But the scene where he walks on the tracks at the end is not good (this is also the director's fault, the play should have ended when the wealthy man laughed.) Secondly, Vivian Gibson, who plays the female actress, is just like the other female actress, too artificial. The news reporter is also very good.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Battle of Tannenberg"</h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the failure of the current disarmament conference is the success of the arms race. The bankruptcy of the economic conference is a warning sign of violent duels. The international situation has reached a point of extreme tension. The slightest, most accidental event can trigger the most cruel and tragic world war, similarly plunging the majority of the world's population into the trap of death and hunger. The fact is very clear: every country is concentrating its efforts on expanding its military, concentrating its economy, and making a desperate gamble. At the same time, in spirit, anything that can stir up the public's interest in war and organize the public's war consciousness is being vigorously promoted! As a result, humanitarian anti-war works like the novel and film "All Quiet on the Western Front" are banned everywhere, while "The Battle of Tannenberg" is being shown!</p>
<p>The story is based on a historical event from the Eastern Front of the European War, where Kaiser Wilhelm II appointed the discarded general Hindenburg to drive out the advancing Russian army, and at the same time, interweaves the story of Lieutenant Arno's martyrdom.</p>
<p>The film greatly emphasizes the bravery of the German army and Hindenburg's strategy, which is indeed an stimulant for the demoralized German public after the defeat. In particular, since Hindenburg is the current president, it can further embolden the German public to prepare for a second world war. Isn't this strongly evidenced by the recent public declaration of the German Stahlhelm (Steel Helmet) Leaguers in the newspapers: "If the First World War had been extended, then victory would have belonged to Germany, but hateful politicians compromised," and so on? Therefore, "The Battle of Tannenberg is a complete and utter war propaganda film!"</p>
<p>Someone here will definitely retort: First, "The Battle of Tannenberg" is a historical fact from the past; second, "The Battle of Tannenberg" can be said to be a pure newsreel. Does a "historical" "newsreel" also have an active role?</p>
<p>We know that the same "historical fact" can lead to two extremely opposite conclusions and effects because of the different viewpoints of the narrator. Taking the First World War as an example, a true opponent of war must particularly expose the evils of war and the actions of the people against war, especially who are the promoters and beneficiaries of war. In this way, people who watch such a film will definitely understand the essence of war and oppose it. Now, "The Battle of Tannenberg" depicts the bravery of the German army on the one hand, and the wisdom of Hindenburg on the other. Of course, the audience will be influenced by it to promote war.</p>
<p>Of course, Lieutenant Arno dies from a gunshot wound just as he is about to embrace his beloved daughter. This point fairly well expresses the pain of war, but in the end, the people of East Prussia commemorate the loyal and brave soldier by erecting a war memorial, and President Hindenburg also personally attends the ceremony, covering up this pain with magnificence and glory. What a deception to the dead and a seduction to the living!</p>
<p>Speaking of technique, naturally, because "The Battle of Tannenberg" has newsreel footage inserted, there are many places where the tone is not very unified, and the actors' performances also neglect many details because the story's waves are too turbulent. "The Big Parade" is a completely newsreel. "The Battle of Tannenberg" is of course more watchable. In particular, the dignified demeanor of the German officers is indeed the face of a great butcher. It still floats in my mind from time to time as I write!</p>
<h3>Xu Lai's Debut Film "Lingering Spring"</h3>
<p>— Jingguan</p>
<p>Ms. Xu Lai, who is known as the Eastern standard of beauty, is still a newcomer in the film industry, but her position is somewhat different from that of ordinary new actors. First, it is because she was originally a dancer, and her success on the stage has already won her many audiences. Second, she was originally a Shanghai socialite.</p>
<p>The theme of her "debut film" "Lingering Spring" is to expose the licentious and decadent lifestyle of bourgeois women. Xu Lai plays the role of a wealthy young lady in the film. The male leads, such as Gong Jianong and Zheng Xiaolun, surround her. The director is Zhang Shichuan.</p>
<p>Based on Ms. Xu's past success in dance and the suitability of the role she plays, we suspect that she will probably not disappoint the audience. As for what the actual result will be? Let's give it a fair critique after it is released!</p>
<h3>Two Sound Films in Progress Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Director Zheng Zhengqiu's "Benefactor and Criminal" is still in production. Due to the meticulousness of the work, what was expected to be completed within a month has had to be extended to three months. Director Zheng himself said that this is a unique and creative work, and the result will definitely surpass "Flower of Freedom." At the same time, the film is being made. The exterior scenes of the film were all taken in Qingdao, and the beauty of the scenery is comparable to the South Seas scenery in American films. It is likely that the two films will be released one after another around the New Year season.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Three-Cornered Moon (4)</h3>
<p>— Bolun</p>
<p>Doctor Stephen nodded, agreeing with Elizabeth's words. Elizabeth asked, "What do you think about us selling this house?" Stephen thought for a moment and shook his head, saying, "The situation is not right. In this economic depression, who wants this house? If you keep this house, you can still have a place to hide. However, the empty rooms upstairs, I think, instead of leaving them there as useless rooms, it is better to rent them out to people. I can rent one to live in. Anyway, I am a single person and have to rent a house everywhere." Elizabeth felt a chill in her heart after hearing Stephen's calm words. This was the first time she had tasted the feeling of not having money. She and her mother cherished the silverware in the wine cellar, the large mirror on the fireplace, the thick felt on the floor, and the ancestral grandfather clock. These were all money. Money was warmth, food, and comfort. The coal burned in winter and the steak in the pot all had to be bought with money. Money was also beauty. So she thought of Ronald, and she couldn't bear to see him suffer as well. He had to be carefree in order to create beautiful works like "Storms and Rains, Thunder and Lightning."</p>
<p>Kenneth went crazy and jumped up, saying, "What's the use of renting out a room? Let the house collapse! Damn it, let it collapse to the bottom. I'm not staying in this house anymore!" Stephen grabbed him, but Elizabeth also jumped up and said, "Let him go. Let's all go, let's all jump into the river hand in hand!" Stephen shouted loudly, "Everyone be quiet. You bunch of kids have really been crazy for too long. But this is a critical moment, can't you still use your brains and come up with ideas?" Elizabeth said, "What ideas do you have?" Stephen said, "Sell all the valuable things you have. Give all the money you get to Elizabeth. Let her manage the accounts, and she will sign the checks."</p>
<p>Mrs. Limburger made a bitter face and said, "I am still the head of the family, why can't I sign the checks?" Stephen warned her, "This time it's like the company is holding a board meeting. What we are discussing is the resignation of the old manager and the election of a new manager. You don't have to worry about the finances from now on." Mrs. Limburger cried sadly and said, "I am the head of the family, why can't I sign the checks?" Elizabeth patted her shoulder and said, "Don't make trouble, you can sign the receipts for Stephen's rent in the future." Stephen also announced, "The rest of you must go find work." These words shocked the Limburger family. Douglas stumbled and said, "Ginny Welch knows a director of a theater guild." He immediately went to call Ginny. Kenneth also flipped through the newspaper, looking for the employment section. Eddie turned on the record player smoothly and naturally.</p>
<p>Elizabeth heard hurried footsteps on the stairs. Ronald was already standing at the door. He looked at Elizabeth happily and said, "Elizabeth, it's done. The end of this chapter couldn't be better." Elizabeth went up to meet him. The wind at the door was very cool. Elizabeth wrapped her collar tighter, feeling strange how she felt cold so quickly now that the money was gone. Then she thought that she had been hungry for half a day. She even thought of Altman's coffee, but she didn't even have the money for the tram, so how could she go out?</p>

<h3>Hitler's German Film Industry Relief Plan</h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>Hitler's long-awaited German film industry relief plan was finally announced recently. The relief plan includes the establishment of a Film Bank, which will lend to film companies struggling with economic panic at the lowest interest rates for the purpose of producing sound films. It is said that the bank's capital reaches tens of millions.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the bank, the German territory needs about 200,000 reels of sound films every year, but domestic companies can only produce 150,000 reels every year. The remaining 50,000 reels of sound films can only rely on the import of foreign films. Therefore, Chancellor Hitler established this film bank in order to eliminate foreign films from the country. The bank's job is to lend small companies two-thirds of the cost of producing sound films. Extremely encourage all film companies in the country to increase production in large quantities, so as to make up for the missing 50,000 reels of sound films.</p>
<p>From this, we can know that in the near future, foreign films will disappear from Germany.</p>
