<h3>日本止提出抵貨條約案梓</h3>
<p>日本將在世界經濟會議提出禁止抵貨之新條約案。以應付中日問題。其説傳之頗久。本日外電乃傳日政府將令其代表中止該提案。日政府之所以有此轉變者。其自述之理由。爲（一）日本堅持由中日兩國直接解决政治經濟上一切問題之原則。斷然拒絕第三國干涉。故日本當以獨自能力解决中國排貨問題。（二）日本在中國之權益。種類頗多。僅僅解决排貨問題。尙難認爲在中國之自衛權已安全。吾人就此兩條簡單之理由。可以完全認識日方於華北停戰後對華之企圖及其手段矣。</p>
<p>日本政府之不願向經濟會議提出抵貨條約案。從一方面觀察。固由於中國抵制日貨之爲對付日本武力侵略之報復手叚。已爲世界所公認。且日商近方盛倡對英印之抵制。與該提案實相矛盾。然吾人之目光。殊不應爲此所迷惑。日本之欲迫中國與之直接交涉。及欲藉軍事之威脅。以解决所謂中日間一切懸案實爲其九一八事變以來所持之根本方針。中國外交當局明乎日本此項方針。對於中國有非常之危險。故有求解决於國聯之應付手叚。中國人民。諗知日本陰謀之所在。故一聞直接交涉之聲。即惶駭無似。今在華北停戰甫告成功之時。日本乃表示千回百折以後。仍欲達其獨佔中國之根本目的。此吾人所深感危懼。不得不急促我當局早爲注意者也。最近宋子文在世界經濟會議之演説。堀述中國之將有以貢獻世界。及拒絕東亞之門羅主義。此在應付日本欲獨佔中國之企圖之一種意義上。爲吾人所贊同者。蓋開放門户政策。雖於中國未盡有利。尙可免於立見分割。吾人今日所欲知者。即宋氏之所聲述。是否爲吾政府一致之方針乎。若然。則吾政府對於日本此項企圖之暴露。將何以應付之乎。</p>
<p>華北停戰協定。在吾國當局。固完全視爲不涉政治外交者。在日方則似將以爲進行其政治外交企圖之階梯。彼之將中止其抵貨條約案之提出。爲兩利相權。必取其重之用心。彼之「須以愼重之態度考慮。」亦考慮其一轉變後所增加之利益之如何耳。</p>

<h3>日本變更方針不提禁止抵貨案</h3>
<p>中日問題以直接交涉爲原則不欲引虎入門啓第三者干涉</p>
<p>軍部與外務省考慮之結果</p>
<h3>經濟金融兩委員會昨上下午分别集議</h3>
<p>（東京）日政府對於世界經濟會議應否提出禁止一般排外貨連動案、因對於日本政治經濟有最大影響、外務省於石井全權離日後、尙與軍部聯絡、以愼重態度研究此問題、至最近因以如下理由决定不提此案、禁止排外貨運動案爲抽象的理論的之提案、當應作爲國際條約然此事在日本有種種複雜情形、即日本主要考慮中國之排日貨問題、然中國與日本之關係、殊與外國間之關係不同、日本以對華問題爲限、堅持由中日兩國直接解决政治經濟上一切問題之鐵則、而斷然拒絕第三國之干涉、故日本當以獨自能力解决中國排日貨問題、又日本在中國之權益頗多種類、僅僅解决排日問題、猶難説日本在中國之自衛權已安全、因此日本爲行使整個自衛權起見、須以愼重之態度考慮問題、政府不日對石井全權訓令此項方針、（十九日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）日政府本欲在倫敦經濟會議提出禁止抵貨之條約案、石井代表已在美國求羅斯福之援助、近因軍部反對、遂作罷論、内田電石井放棄原議軍、部反對理由爲、（一）禁抵貨之條約案、雖爲普通條約、其實日本之目的在制止中國之抵制日貨、則因此條約引起第三國參加中日紛爭、日本終不能單獨與中國私自解决一切懸案、於日本不利、（二）日本政府主張亞洲門羅主義、新條約違背主義自引虎入門、（三）在中國之利權、日與各國比較、日本居多、若新條約成立、則不能再藉口於自衛、而開始軍事行動、於日有損無益、（四）日本爲欲實行國策、在華應保持廣大之自衛權、以便應時取必要行動、（十九日華聯電）</p>

<h3>聽任貨幣自漲自落</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）此間貨幣專家及美國他邑金融界要人對於白宫所抱安定國際匯價態度、今亦深爲疑惑、泛舟海上之總統因避風雨駛入麻州愛迪嘉唐灣、但自出京以來、對於開會期内安定匯價之歐洲提議、迄未發表意見、僅由財政部間接表示總統反對此舉而已、據聞總統出京後、倫敦發展情形仍隨時以無線電報告總統、逆料定有訓令致美代表團惟此中内容、官塲絕無表示、因此美京一般的印象多以爲總統在倫敦會議未商妥永久安定計劃以前、欲暫時聽任貨幣自行漲落、不加人力、按當美代表團出發時曾宣稱挾三大目的而往、即減輕關税·提高物價·與安定匯價、旣抵倫敦、乃對於安定匯價並無計劃提出、迄今僅以歐洲提議轉達本國、因此美京人士信總統抱暫時放任態度者日衆云、（十八日國民電）</p>

<h3>日本金融界之顧慮</h3>
<p>（東京）日本匯兑銀行以及橫濱正金銀行、對於美國之日美匯兑協定意嚮、謂日本之匯兑保留於二十五美金關者、僅由片面匯兑勉被維持、　而非根據於日本貿易之轉佳、赤字公債之解消、及通貨膨脹之縮小等、緣日金安定之原因並無所憑、而將對美匯兑安定於二十六七美金、實不合理、且結果不成問題、又　獲得一定之安定而訂協定、在英美法等持有多金之國家、固可以維持、但日本則不可能也、總之該問題爲恢復金本位後之問題、故起首即表明反對、一方面匯兑業等於匯兑比率之公定化、亦因其涉及原則的、若如今之無匯兑安定機關之日本現狀、其見解亦以爲安定不可能、况英美法之匯兑協定尙難成立時、而决定日美匯兑比率實屬無理也云、（十九日電通電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）美政府拒絕贊助减輕關税什一之建議、歐陸各國皆爲憤然、此多出於誤會、蓋諸代表仍保持彼等自己之政治聯絡也、同時減輕關税什一之提議、雖未列入美國正式建議中、然目下仍在大會之前、（十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本反對減低關税</h3>
<p>（東京）美國代表所提出之關税一律减一成案、日政府表示反對、其所述之反對理由、爲（一）世界首要國家在歐戰後、均提高其關税、日政府自明治四十二年制定以來、雖數次加以小部份之修改、但全關税法迄今未曾改過故、其税率較輕、（二）若此案不以普遍條約之形式審議、而使利害關係較爲密切之兩國間簽訂互惠協定、第三國以最惠國約欵均潤其利、則日政府亦可以同意、（三）若准日本提高其關税、增加到與各國同一程度、然後再降减其一成、如此辦法日政府或可以同意、否則不能參加新協定、（四）美國之提案、其目的在延長關税休戰、在原則上本無異議、但參加國中欲附保留條件、可以征收傾銷税、如此則新條約之效力已等於廢紙、雖參加亦不能得利益、（五）會議之大勢若不能接受日本之主張、採用别國之協定、而採用普遍條約、日本須召開國會、或以臨時敕令修改關税法、此點須待各省之共同研究、（十九日華聯電）</p>

<h3>德國國會第三次再選結果（柏林通信）（公安）</h3>
<p>國會被焚之謎</p>
<p>國會被焚之經過德國國會會塲不幸於本年二月廿七晚九時半、發生火警、當時雖經柏林救火隊奮勇解圍、但因爆發火勢猛烈、不易撲滅、直至深夜十一時半、始行救息、至是偉大國會會塲已大部份變做枯瓦焦垣、損失當在百萬馬克之鉅、</p>
<p>此次國會被焚、實屬非常離奇、自此事發生後、不獨在柏林及全德國内引起非常之驚動、騷擾與恐慌、即在歐美輿論上亦惹起絕大之注意、在世界史上、國會被焚確亦罕見之事、蓋此次德國國會火災非由失愼而肇禍、查其原因、謂係德國共產黨人所爲、乃一種有計劃的反對現存希拉忒法西斯黨人右傾内閣政府之暴動行爲、柏林警察廳當塲捕獲起火嫌疑犯Munchen氏、係一荷蘭靑年共產黨氏被捕後、亦曾怛然自認放火行爲、並謂放火動機係在圖報國際資本主義之仇而發云云、同時據他方面社會輿論上傳出消息、國會被焚純係德國共產黨同左翼戰綫（即德國社會民主黨）之陰謀暴動、搗亂現成社會制度、企圖奪取政權而成就其暴動計劃、不獨焚毁國會已也、實則全德國政府機關及各大城市自來水廠、電燈廠及瓦斯廠、皆在其進行毁壞之中云、自此險惡而嚴重之謠傳放佈後、柏林市民首當其衝、驚惶萬狀、一時大陷社會於紅色恐怖、其在各城邦間、莫不談虎色變、人心惶惶、全國突呈革命之緊漲空氣、記者當時因事居留Munchen、目擊是間政治空氣至爲險惡、且因Munchen在國會被焚案未產生之前、此處政府不滿柏林希拉忒内閣政治行爲、屢有保皇復辟運動、已使人心有所戒懼、再加共產暴動之恐慌、其紛擾情形、實難描寫、記者居德多年、誠未有體騐過德國社會之政治生活、如此次因國會被焚所引起者、與可怕的社會紛擾與嚴重、</p>
<p>德國政府爲安定人心及預防不測計、旋於國會被焚後一日、（即二月廿九日）即根據聯邦憲法第四十八條第四節條文、（本條憲法條文規定、遇國家社會、發生非常嚴重事案、有妨害國家及人民之生命危險時、德國大總統有欋頒佈危急訓</p>
<p>令、或稱例外法、並可以適用政府一切最大可能之權力、以保國家社會之安全）頒佈危急訓令、柏林宣佈戒嚴、積極厲行嚴防共變、搜查及封閉全柏林共產黨及民主黨機關、逮捕全國共產黨和社會民主黨重要份子、不下千數百人、其中大部份是屬於新聞記者、大學敎授、大學生、醫生律師、文學家、小説家、並有一部份屬於外國共產黨分子、同時全國政治機關由首都以至鄉村、皆一律嚴行改組、政府機關職員凡稍涉左傾分子、一律革職違者逮捕、或以武裝接收、至在輿論上共黨和社會民主黨報館一槪封閉嚴行新聞檢查、所以輿論界對此次事變絕無批評之可能、從而事之是非曲直局外人殊難瞭解、當時内閣政府對此事變之處置、謂之進行國家革命、肅淸共黨總、之其實際情况完全與中國舉行淸黨時絕無出入、因之所以吾人亦可謂、德國此次政變、謂之德國法西斯舉行淸黨、至爲的當　切題、</p>
<h3>國會被焚的政治背景</h3>
<p>此次德國國會被焚事案、據政府方面宣告、固謂出於左派共黨及社會民主黨反政府之暴動陰謀、要之此事歸罪與定斷是否切實與正確、社會輿情不無疑問、英法瑞美言論界對此定斷常示以問號、可見此案之怪象、左派則是極端否認、亟欲有所表白、但政府早已絕對嚴格奪了左派的發言權了、因是社會人士及外國旁觀者、莫能一聆左派之辯護從而德國國會被禁問題、益成爲政治之大謎、國外不少輿論界、直疑此案係右派内閣政府的政治反宣傳作用、蓋國會一再選舉時期已在目前、（三月五日）左派分子爲謀獲得選民　情、以期增加選票起見、自當以圓滑手段及和平政策、進行競選、方爲合理、彼竟不此之圖、在競選前突演殺人放火政策、使社會上予彼以恐慌心理及不良之印象、競選當然没有勝利之可能、此種行爲無異自殺政策、左派要是稍具政治常識、當决不致演出如此下策、反之右派希拉忒法西斯政府、因國會一再選舉時期在即、欲爲根本上打倒左派競選集團及其勢力起見、儘可利用一種反宣傳政策、以子之矛、陷子之盾、自行不惜巨大犧牲、將國會放火、嫁難於左黨、因是、一方面使國人見左派共社兩派行爲如此暴戾與　怕、必生痛恨與仇視心理、人民對彼必起離心作用、至競選時自然可减少其選民勢力、他方面政府　此放火罪名、即可利用政府權能、嚴禁差派共社兩黨言論及政治的一切行動、並逮捕其領袖、解散其黨團、如是左派戰線勢力當在無形中宣告破產與瓦解、競選自然無能爲力、結果、祇剩得法西斯右派單獨操縱選舉運動、而有達其最後選舉勝利之可能、此種推度當較合理、要之莫論其誰爲禍首、而此次德國國會被焚事件、確當成爲德國政治上一大奇案、至堪奈人尋味也、</p>
<h3>國會被焚及其對於國會第三次再選的影響</h3>
<p>德國國會於二月二十七晚被焚、至二十八及三月一二數日間、德國社會政治局面、一時確係呈出一種萬分危險的嚴重狀態、全國下令戒嚴、柏林警察防禦實力不足、即刻補充大量鋼夾團協同警察維持治安、至三月五日、舉行國會第三次選舉時、社會雖稍形恢復常態、然人心如驚弓之鳥、尙屬不無杯弓蛇影之態、但是日競選運動、因左派共社兩黨均被嚴禁活動、早已掩旗息鼓、左派戰綫不獨連競選傳單不准分發、甚至連半句口號也不准呐喊、至是左派可謂完全喪失了國民政治活動的自動權、反之現政府的法西斯（即國家社會勞働黨）却是有色有聲、揚揚得意、籍着共黨放火燒國會的罪名、可以大肆攻擊共黨非法行爲之宣傳、希拉忒更籍政府權力、利用全國無綫電放聲機、對全國民衆作長篇大段之競選演講、辭意悲痛淋漓、激發全國一致反共、引斥階級爭鬥、擁護全國總體國民利益、全國民衆爲此悲痛演辭之感動、他方面對於共黨暴動行爲、又是驚心怵目、結果、至參加競選時、必爲法西斯聲調所吸收、當無疑問、法西斯右派處於如此有利的競選情形之下、所以有識之士、早已預測其必獲良好結果、是以國會被焚、即爲法西斯競選勝利之前兆、（待續）</p>
<h3>川戰範圍擴大</h3>
<p>川西和平絕望川東戰雲密佈重慶通信、川戰自再度重開以來、已逾四十餘日、雖中央迭有命令制止、各方亦有不少和平呼籲、乃二十四、八兩軍卒未停止軍事行動、依然仍相持於毘河沿線、陣線殊無若何進展、乃在此川西戰事尙未結束之際、而川東戰事、又復爆發、二十一·四·兩軍、又正式開火、戰爭範圍擴大、全川益陷於禍亂境中、不可收拾、爰將詳情誌次、</p>
<h3>劉文輝無停戰誠意</h3>
<p>川西戰禍主角二十四軍長劉文輝、近來竭力宣傳和平、除發出停戰文電及下令停止前線各部進攻外、並將所有各路總指揮·總司令等臨時名義、一律撤銷、表示實行停戰、且聲言今後非二十八軍鄧錫侯大部進攻、决不還擊、若小部挑釁、則置之不理、僅阨守毘河、封鎖二十八軍之反攻、實則係劉文輝手腕之一種、其用意爲藉口和平、斷絕二十八軍方面之援兵、並移轉各方之目標避免攻擊、事實上則二十四軍對二十八軍、固未稍停進攻、故毘河戰事、時緩時急、不過無劇烈之激戰而已、成都和平會議、推舉劉肇乾（現任二十三軍第一師師長）晋謁劉文輝、詢以眞實態度、並瀝陳川局前途、極爲可慮、大意謂「川北赤匪、餘燄重燃、通南再陷、危機迫切而川東川南、則股匪蠭起、出没無常勦不勝勦當此之時、縱各軍協力以圖奠安川局、猶恐不濟、何堪再起内戰、自相殺伐、一旦橫决爲禍、何可勝言、且値民生凋敝之際、厭戰人同此心、中央與各方、　不盼望息爭、倘戰禍重開、亦恐難解於人、况晋康與公、少同硯席、又係多年袍澤、私交不可謂不厚、患難濺呵相共、何事不可互相諒解、此次戰事、晋康固難辭馭下不嚴之咎、但自開戰以來、該軍防地　減二分之、一目前僅處新都金堂廣漢新繁彭縣等地、欲謀生存、自成問題、全軍給養、無法維持、要求還防、亦有其不得已之苦衷、應請顧念川局前途、相當容納鄧部還防之請、其他一切條件、未嘗不可從長計議、要不外使兩軍本苦樂均等之原則、得一解决之道、公誼私情、皆可從此顧全」等語、劉文輝當表示無成見可言、惟關於二十八軍回防一層、表示目前尙辦不到、蓋其態度之較前軟化、純係因爲川東二十一軍出兵問題、故劉文輝特將川西方面主力部隊、集中川南及東道一帶、並重新委出三路總指揮、一路爲陳鴻文、配兵十五團、在資陽·簡陽方面、二路爲張淸平、配兵二十團、在仁　·井研間·三路爲冷盧東、配兵十五團在川西毘河一帶、以一二兩路出動迎擊二十一軍、以三路抵抗二十八軍、劉文輝並於成都成立守警司令部、準備大戰、</p>
<h3>鄧錫侯謀擴大戰爭</h3>
<p>二十八軍鄧錫侯、此次對二十四軍銜恨非、常表示非根本消滅不可、當劉文輝舉兵相攻時、即具决心、故不惜卑躬屈詞、奔走於廿一軍之前、乞劉湘援助、並極力拉攏李其相·羅澤洲兩部、擴大川戰、組織反劉集團、圖謀推翻二十四軍、故成都和平會議、迭次向鄧請示和平辦法、鄧初無具體之表示、最後、鄧提出條件、須劉文輝將所侵略之防地及省中税收税關、完全退讓、始有和平餘地、十四日、鄧在漢州召集全軍將領會議、又决定非恢復戰前狀况、不允調解、如各個人所提出之苦樂均等原則、以雙方各走極端、意見距離太遠、難期接近、欲求實現和平、自非採取折衷辦法、兩相讓步不可、乃主張二十八軍讓出一二縣防地、二十四軍則將簡陽全部讓歸二十八軍、以爲可稍平雙方之氣、惟鄧氏仍無讓步之表示、對於調人之調解原則、始終未贊一詞、且未能派出全權代表、致各調人束手無策、日來鄧又聯同該軍各將領、致電二十一軍劉湘、請立即出兵戡亂、該軍願聽命前驅、劉湘已應其請正準備出兵矣、</p>
<h3>劉湘出兵援鄧攻劉</h3>
<p>二十一軍劉湘近以川西戰事、奉中央嚴令全權處理、裁制雙方而命錫侯又來電請即出師更兼劉湘部之李羅爲鄧錫侯舊部、尤躍躍欲試、極力請命於劉、早日出師、劉湘在此種環境之下、遂召集全體將領、共商辦法、各將領均一致主戰、於是確定集中兵力四十團以王治易爲前敵總指揮、郭勛爲副指揮、王芳舟爲總司令、分兩路向二十四軍進攻、一路向簡陽資陽進逼、一路由榮縣威遠向嘉定井研進逼、頃據前方電訊、二十一軍第一路於十六日已與二十四軍於北斗鎭地方（資陽屬地）接觸、激戰頗烈、川戰範圍、已擴大矣、</p>
<h3>劉湘與楊森亦衝突</h3>
<p>駐防北道之二十軍長楊森、日前爲擴充該軍戰鬥力起見、特籌鉅欵、派專員在滬向外商訂購新式衝槍五百支、手提式機關槍五百支、新式步槍五千支、由何成濬負責輸運入川、詎到萬縣及重慶兩地、被二十一軍下令扣留、楊森聞信、迭電劉湘、請予發還、並派代表蕭壽眉一再交涉、均無結果、以致楊森大怒、下令動員以十五團之衆、向二十八軍防區梁山·大竹·潾水一帶、警戒挑釁、似此情况、川東戰事、勢將繼川西戰事而起矣、（六月十七日）</p>
<h3>平政委會與新聞界之糾紛</h3>

<h3>預定計劃</h3>
<p>迨陳公博繼任實業部長後、因翻閲前案、得悉此事已有相當籌劃、乃復與趙氏數度磋商、繼續進行辦理、結果、當决定先小規模着手、資本原定國幣二十五萬元、官股爲五分之二、商股爲五分之三、商股之十五萬元由趙氏負責招足、其官股十萬元、當以國庫奇絀、特向中英庚欵董事會、商借庚欵一部以作官股欵項、此事業經接洽就緒、</p>
<h3>擴大規模</h3>
<p>嗣有向在爪哇開設糖廠之華僑黃江泉、得悉本國將舉辦酒精廠、非常嘉悦以本人所辦之糖廠糠渣、可爲酒精原料、如能投資合作、將來可一舉兩得、故立即兼程來滬赴京、迭與實業部長陳公博及趙晋卿氏等接洽、願意投資加入商股、同時并擬擴大該廠規模將預定之二十五萬元資本、增爲一百萬元、俾將來出貨、可供全國之需、</p>

<h3>申報叢書蘇聯婦女的生活提要</h3>
<p>樊英女士編著十二開本　全書五二頁實價洋二角　紙面三</p>
<p>本書要點，可槪括如次：第一，蘇聯女子與男子絕對平等。男女平等，在今日原則上雖已爲各國所一一承認，但實際上還是差别得很多。　如女子一家庭中，普通總是服從男子，以男爲家屬中心；女子的地位，一般人還是認爲只是男子的附屬物，以爲女子只應盡力家庭工作，不應參加社會活動；在法律上，政治上，女子也處處受到限制，不能盡量發展其能力。在蘇聯，則完全反是。蘇聯婦女，現在可説是已經得到絕對自由，無論在那一方面，她們不再受到無理的限制。她們同男子一樣積極的參加工作，參加社會活動。她們已不是一個被束縛的家庭中的主婦，而是一個活潑潑的「社會人」了。第二，蘇聯婦女經濟獨立。我們知道，男女的不平等，最大的原因是由於婦女經濟不能獨立。蘇聯婦女所以能夠獲得完全自由，也就由於她們經濟能夠獨立。蘇聯婦女，現在同男子一樣都從事於職業。根據一九三二年上半年的統計，蘇聯中小學敎師，女性平均要佔百分之五五·四，法庭審判員佔百分之二十以上，女醫士佔百分之七二·六；產業勞動方面，全蘇聯女士總計達六百五十餘萬。由此可以看出蘇聯婦女在經濟上之解放，及其能力之發展。第二，婚姻絕對自由。在蘇聯，結婚離婚，絕對自由，結婚儀式，非常簡單，只須到登記處登記一下就行。離婚也是如此，不必得對方同意，要離就離。婚姻在蘇聯看來很平常，算不得一回什麽「終身　　」。戀　在蘇聯也完全自由。他們完全没有什麽禮敎的防閑，然而蘇聯的風化却　常好，「强姦」「二誘姦」之事，從來不曾有，絕不像我國一面是　禮敎自豪，而另一面，「强姦」「誘姦」等消息，充滿了我們耳朶。「而目戀　　　　　　　在破金　　地位的觀念了。因爲蘇聯女子，大都可以自食其力，金錢和地位，對於她們是不重要的」。「因失戀而消極，以至於自殺，這類事情，在蘇聯也全然聽不到」。因爲「他們的人生觀，是努力的參加建設未來的社會，是參與一切社會活動，男女間看戀愛不過是工餘作樂之一種罷了」。第四，文化程度提高。在從前，蘇聯婦女不識字的，要佔百分之九十，現在她們都已完全有受敎育的機會。蘇聯女學生，和男學生一樣，自小學至大學，費用完全由國家擔任。到大學後並由國家津貼生活費。此外有女工補習班，訓練非常完密，蘇聯現有不少女工程師發明家，都出身於比種補習班，她們起初都是一字不識的。所以在蘇聯各人的能力，都有機會平均發展，絕不會因有錢無錢的差别而至少數人可以受敎育多數人不能受敎育。第五，女子參加社會活動之積極。蘇聯婦女，對於政治，對於一切社會活動，她們都非常熱心參加。在歐美各國，也許有幾個　出的上等婦女，參加政治，在蘇聯則爲成千成萬的婦女羣衆普遍的參加。她們在政治方面所表現的能力，完全不弱於男子。第一次五年計劃的成功，她們尤有很大的功勞。「别國的婦女運動，還是以爭取婦女本身在政治上法律上的澈底解放爲目的，而現在蘇聯的婦女運動的目的，則爲如何去實現婦女已得到的利益」。這在蘇聯現在可以説已經實現。上述五點，便是本書所描寫的主要項目。從這　，我們對於蘇聯婦女生活大槪可以有個明晣印象。他告訴我們蘇聯婦女是如何幸福，如何由家庭中解放出來成爲「社會人」。可是我們不要忘記，她們這幸福，是經過辛辛苦苦的奮鬭得來的。所以本書開宗明義第一句就這樣説：「蘇聯婦女生活今日能在世界各國婦女界中獨放一異彩者，全由於一九一七年「十月革命」之賜！」這是我們最要留意的一點。著者樊英女士，曾留學莫斯科多年，又遍歷蘇聯各要地，親見親聞，故所述皆確切有據。全書文字亦淸暢淺顯。凡留心婦女問題尤其對於當前中嗣婦女的出路問題希望得一解决之途者，看過本書，我相信一定能給他不少豐富的資料。首附擇圖八幅。</p>

<h3>抵貨</h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>畫報上。常看到甘地赤着膊在紡紗，據説，他不願穿英國布，寗可赤着膊；他要穿自製土布，所以在紡紗。他紡紗得這麽動，甚至到倫敦出席圓桌會議，仍帶着一架簡陋紡紗器。人都説他怪，我佩服他勇。</p>
<p>甘地是一個亡國之氓，和我們中國人比較，似不及中國人自由。但英國却没有强制他穿英國布，亦没有禁止他帶紡紗器。是否甘地的精誠足以奪人，還是英國恃予　容？姑置不論；但印度雖已亡國，而其人民之「服用自由」，尙未完全剝奪，似可斷言。中國在實際上雖是次殖民地，名義上總還掛着獨立國的　牌。人民穿着東洋貨高視　步在街上走，東洋物品家家羅得成堆，而日本還説中國人有組織的在抵貨，違反國際公理，官司打過太平洋，非得强制中國人個個購用日貨不可。這是什麽世界！</p>
<p>我有錢，你有貨，買不買由得我，　不　聽憑你。飛機大砲是你的兇，我怕你，做買　却得講個理。如果做買　也像飛機大砲一般的不講理，非買你的不可，還成什麽世界！</p>
<p>屎，人都知道它臭。砒，人都知道它　。但也只要自願，吃屎服砒並不算什麽回事。如非出於自願而强要他吃屎服砒，不吃，不服，就算違反公理；二十世紀雖説黑暗，怕不致黑暗到遣個地步！</p>
<p>其實，日本人可算蠢極。他們可以威脅中國取締一切抵貨組織，但究不能威脅中國人個個去買日貨。日本用貨物賺了中國人的錢，製造飛機大砲去屠殺他們，中國人雖説懦，這服砒霜却不願意呑。所以在轉展哀號毫無辦法之中，想出末着棋子來抵貨。這原是各個天良自然的流露，旣無所謂提倡，其實也用不到組織一類的處名。</p>
<p>我們姑不談中國人購買日貨與否有絕對完全的自由，誰都不容置喙。就是退一步説，承認不買日貨是激於義憤，是一種報復手段；但中國領土人民給日本宰割到這種地步，所謂報復手段，除限軟弱無力的抵貨，别無他法，眞是説也可憐。假使并此正當自衛手段都要剝奪，那還是把四萬萬中國人屠殺個精光，任憑你去橫行，豈不澈底痛快！</p>
<p>人們祗知甘地領導印度人民奮鬥的苦痛，而不知世界上還有比印度多一層束縛的民族，這個民族也就太慘苦了！</p>
<h3>秦淮復興</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>華燈燦爛的彩船，悠揚曼妙的管絃，婉轉嬌媚的歌聲：這是六朝綺麗豪華金迷紙醉的秦淮河特有的美境。這美景良宵，在民國十六年奠定新都時，且曾給人以很深刻的印象，在初期北伐勝利的時代，猶留下不少的風流韵事。　　然而十六年代過去以後，秦淮河受着禁娼的影響，無形中遭遇意外的打擊，幾年以來的荒凉寂寞，一種凄慘的景象；眞要使騷人詞客欷嘘不已丨什麽令人傾倒的畫舫彩船，經不住冷風凄雨的打擊，且不惜改頭换面潛往玄武湖作流浪生涯；彷彿一個中落的大家弟子，漂泊他鄉作餬口生活一般了。「秦淮也似佳人老，剩粉殘脂倍可憐」！好像在九一八以前，有過一位詩人，如此弔過秦淮。　　最近大槪是要利用歌舞點綴昇平罷；所以，那不澈底的禁娼，終於正式决定開放，不再掩耳盜鈴了。説是自七月一日開始解禁；這解鈴擊鈴的把戲，尙未如儀去做，眼前的秦淮河已顯然無忌的告訴我們，早在「先行交易」了。</p>
<p>秦淮河上的碧水，在燈光掩映之下，漾起絲絲的眼波，傳出縷縷的歌聲，浮現出翩翩的儷影，那許多　媚的女郎，那許多豪華的靑年，在許久不曾公開的放縱以後，現在是「夜夜秦淮滿春風」了。秦淮復興的徵象，已如此顯然了；不過，我們這老大的民族，何時才可顯見出復興的朕兆呢？</p>
<h3>鼻烟的趣史</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>「鼻烟」這樣東西，在現代的社館裏，好算是「落伍」的了。最盛軠的時候，在前淸末葉。凡是王公大臣，大小官僚，都以鼻烟爲愛物，以嗅鼻烟爲闊綽。那用的鼻烟壺，也非常考究，都是隨身携帶，表示他是「特殊階級」的人物。所以鼻烟一物，最富於「貴族色彩」，當然非平民所都能享受。因爲不能普及的緣故，便館鬧出笑話來。現在在下把這段詼諧的故事，寫在下面：聊博讀者們的一噱！</p>
<p>在十幾年前，内地交通，還不大便利。水上往來，都仗着「航船」行駛。有的鄉鎭地方，至今尙未絕跡。那趁航船最難解决的，就是婦女們的「便溺問題」。路近的還好，路途較遠的，眞是欲便無從。做男子的，還可以推　篷子，拉開褲子，一瀉千里。做女性的，因爲生理上的關係，就没有這樣的便宜行事了。</p>
<p>一天，有位幽默家也趁着航船；他忽聽得婦女隊中，嘖嘖之聲，不絕於耳，曉得伊們都鬧着「内急」了。他便在身邊掏出一個鼻烟壺來，倒出鼻烟，慢慢的向着鼻子管裏捫，態度安閒。同船的鄉人見了這種情形，都有些不懂。説嗅這東西，有什麽用處呢？他答道：這是很珍貴的鼻烟。嗅了它，可以舒暢氣機。還有一樣妙用，就是出門旅行的人，不可不　。嗅了這烟，便館不想小便。要想小便的，嗅了，也館忍耐得住。一般内急的婦女聽了，都暗暗稱奇。説大家可否凑些錢，向你先生購些，行行方便。這位幽默家慨然道：大家都是出門人，應互相帮助，要什麽錢呢？各婦女都再三稱謝；他便把鼻烟向着各人掌中輸送。於是衆婦女都不約而同的，嗅着這「神丹妙藥」。不料頓時間如響斯應，有的噴嚔連連，有的咳嗆頻頻，一齊發作起來。經此劇烈的震動，那下部醖釀已久的小便，再也忍耐不住，奪門而出。都縐着眉，紅着臉，抱怨上了他的大當，説不應該無故開這玩笑。那幽默家還這樣説：這不是鼻烟的不靈，實在是你們不聞慣這鼻烟的緣故。否則那裏館有這樣的反應呢！</p>
<h3>哀蔣煒文</h3>
<p>— 庚白</p>
<p>蔣煒文者，世所稱丁玲女士也。舊除夕余於達夫座上與别，無何竟以死耗聞，煒文故爲共產黨人胡也頻之妻，也頻殁，益趨左傾，善今體散文及小説，　少年馮達亦慘死，時以哀之。驚從除夜盡交期，文　，容光接所悲。世亂連人寗倖免？邦危死所故難知。流傳　有　官在，隱秘猶存匹婦疑。地下胡馮應一默，更於鬼籙賭雙棲。</p>
<p>曉行霞飛路</p>

<h3>時鮮果品</h3>
<p>— 朱戳</p>
<p>在這榴花眼，荷錢出水的夏季；那絢爛的春花，都已結了肥美的果品。紅酣的色彩，甜美的滋味，當你走過那果品堆得杏紅梅綠的水果舖時，那誘人的色彩，不由不引起食慾。夏季確是果品的豐富而當令的時季，蘇州在這時期裏，也產有幾種時鮮的果品。現在把他寫在下面。</p>
<p>梅光福鎭上鄧尉山的梅是名聞全國的，所以梅實，也是蘇州一種出品。梅子的味道，生食時是酸　齒牙，除了一部喜歡吃酸的人們嗜食外，並不是人人喜食的。但把梅製造的食品却種類很多。除了白糖梅子，（靑梅外而拌着白糖）糖油梅子，脆梅之外；最出名的，當然是陳皮梅了。那種食品，具消食生津的功效，冠生園出品的陳皮梅，尤其來得暢銷全國。南貨舖中的霜梅，是製玟瑰醬必須的副品。蘇州茶食舖中，把梅做的食品，也有五六種；像「嘴酸」，（有甜鹹兩種）「靑梅」「靑梅乾」「藥梅片「；（有玟瑰·甘草·桂花·三種）那甜鹹梅皮，更是價貴人茶食，要售兩元多一斤哩。此外還有梅醬和酸梅湯，也是把梅做主料的食品。</p>
<p>杏紅酣的色彩，多麽的誘人食慾；杏，磂也是一種可口的果品。杏實熟的鮮甜甘美，滋味很好。茶食店中的杏脯，也是很好的食品，丨蘇州製的杏脯，雖尙可口，但比了北平出品的杏脯，甜而不俗，肥而不膩，却没有那般肉厚味美了。杏核中的仁，不但是很好的食品，並且還可作治咳的藥物。把杏仁搗爛濾汁，和糖同煮，喝起來香味旣佳，還具有止咳潤肺的功效，是一種很好的飲料。</p>
<p>桃那果汁最多，肥美可口的，桃子，當然是上好的果品。蘇州出產的桃實，普通的；有落林桃，鹹酸桃，紅桃，水蜜桃幾種。他的味雖然没有　華的水蜜桃，和山東的肥城桃，那麽可口；但甜汁四濺，甘留齒牙，吃起來却也快生朶頤，尤其是蔣圃的水蜜桃，更來得馳名蘇州，那種桃子，在嫰白中微透臙紅，色彩也嬌艷欲滴。桃實除了生食，還可製果醬，和罐頭食品，拌了氷冷食，更其來得凉生齒頰，還是袪暑妙法，不讓瓜李占美呢。</p>
<p>枇杷有紅沙，白沙兩種，太湖中的洞庭山，和光福鎭上，都是枇杷的出產處。那一球球的果品，吃起來甜浸口齒，不但是其味可口；並且還具有潤肺和潤腸的效力。蘇州出產的枇杷，以光福的窰上，最爲有名，那水晶丸似的白沙枇杷，形式旣小，滋味的鮮甜，却是首屈一指的。把枇杷製膏，也是治咳妙品，和杏仁有同一的功效。</p>
<p>楊梅楊梅成熟的時候，那粒粒火珠，漫山漫谷，在洞庭山上，點綴出一種異樣的影色。楊梅是蘇州出產最多的果品，他的滋味，在甜中略帶些兒酸。吃的時候因他没有皮彀保護，須先把冷開水洗一遍，然後略加些鹽，才好吃食，不過多吃了，舌子就要發毛，失去辨味效能。楊梅浸燒酒，陳了可以治腹瀉。</p>
<p>果品的滋味，是鮮美可口的，並且還具着食的功效，「飯後一蘋果，醫生處用，」足見果品的功效的一斑。所以吃了飯後，吃些水果，於身體上，是十分有益的，不過貪得無厭，任情大嚼，那就有腹瀉之　，所以吃水果也須有限止，否則就要變做「病從口入，」有損無益了。</p>

<h3>日布井無懈可擊</h3>

<p>奮力應戰、無懈可擊、日本隊乃以九比七勝第二盤、</p>
<h3>克勞福利用弱點</h3>
<p>第三盤佐藤顯露倦態、雨後塲地又極重滯、球落地後、不易躍起、克勞福利用比點、乃以削球制敵、澳洲隊得以六比三勝第三盤、</p>
<h3>二比二打成平手</h3>
<p>第四盤中、雙方皆露疲乏之狀、而以佐藤與克勞福爲尤甚、四人之中、當以靑年之布井爲最佳、澳洲選手、雖時向布井進攻、而渠輒應付裕如、佐藤旋亦自振、故日本隊以卒三勝第四盤、</p>
<h3>苦戰後日本淘汰</h3>

<p>兩敵先共攝一影、留作紀念、繼由球證召集雙方隊長、作擇門之舉、東華得背日順風之利、迨至五時許、兩軍在裁判員生里氏銀笛聲中、宣告開火、全菲隊正前鋒、撥動球體、威風凛凛、猛攻來華防線、但被屠馮孫把關截路、球反落全菲陣地、東華前鋒五將、齊進環攻、球爲左中衛陽出、如是兩隊於追逐球體往還之間、混戰數分鐘之久、</p>
<h3>征塵滾滾未建功</h3>
<p>東華五前鋒忽用聲東擊西之法、殺過中衛、直迫龍門、爲勢甚　、菲軍右衛急出招架、飛身抗拒、馮運佑匹騎衝出、仆地命射、球勢峻急、中門橫楣、球反彈出門、前十五碼之遙、陳家球奔前加上一脚、球勢略高、越門而過此二球未能直入敵壘、四座爲之婉惜不已、但雖未命中、然馮陳施此下馬威、敵軍莫不爲之駭然失色、俄傾東華捲土重來、勢如排山倒海、孫忠敬截球獨進成單刀赴會之勢、距敵門十餘碼之遙、被左中纏繞、但仍被孫虎將發足命射、爲菲守門所接、踢出不遠、恰爲陳虞添截得、再行猛射、惜略斜出界、又不能建立奇功、</p>
<p>三角優勢竟徒勞　東華再次興師、迫得角球三次、然對方壁壘森嚴、無隙可乘、東華前鋒中衛、先後蹂躪敵門、險象環生、雖得鐵門將力挽狂瀾、但球勢仍在全菲門前區域盤旋、以敵軍如是之奮勇抵抗、可見非有出奇制勝之師、勝算亦非易操也、</p>
<p>曹秋亭出奇制勝　在此混戰之際、陳洪光忽得錢敬鏞之交球、突然脱頴而出、陳家球並肩齊進、殺過中衛、敵左衛出而拒敵、陳洪光帶球疾奔、左讓右閃、隨交陳家球、陳廣脚傳右、曹秋亭沿邊引線穿針、砰然一聲、斜射入網、敵門將跪地擋球、但來勢至勁、反彈入網、博得滿塲彩聲、得此先着、我方聲勢大壯、</p>
<p>敵軍奮勇大反攻　全菲選手、爲精鋭成軍之師、失此球後、豈甘示弱、前鋒益該勵軍心、極力　機反攻、企圖報復、由其右内鋒長脚仙、得後方接濟、　策馬前進、深知東華後衛堅固、乃在中衛線附近立行遠射、陸鍾恩接得、反彈門外、奥氏前衛欲再迎之以脚、當此一髮千鈞之際、我方門將旣援救不及、幸得　洵安奮不顧身、臥地一踢、重圍遂解、此時反危爲安、非長　將軍、鉞無此能力也、</p>
<p>乘勝後再展雄威　少息之後、易壘再戰、東華爲變更戰路計、乃略調動人馬、馮運佑任右衛、梁樹棠任左中衛、陳家球任右内鋒、李義臣出任正前鋒、此君前患肚疴、致三塲比賽、表演不見施展好身手、本日痊愈、精神煥發、打來舉止活動、其盤扭剷球之技、誠出神入妙、　賽聲中、前敵司令、揚臂一呼、率領三軍東窺西探、三傳四遞、節節進逼、錢敬鏞得孫思敬之高球、立頂與李義臣、李立卽施射球從中直入、雖被敵門將接住、但咄咄迫人、幾不可一世、</p>
<p>十二碼敵壘又陷　敵軍　此摧殘壓迫之下、藉順風之利、努力反攻、迫得角球三次、但三試均被陸鍾恩所接、其後互有安危、戰情亦至劇烈、但東華屢佔攻勢、李義臣奪球、高傳與錢敬鏞、錢迎之以頭、適中全菲龍門、曹秋亭衝前再迎以頭、加些亞氏揮拳擊球出界、無如東華前鋒五虎將將全菲城門、圍得水洩不通、當在罰球區域、混戰之前、全菲正中衛手觸球體、球證生里氏明察秋毫、立卽判令罰十二碼自由球、李義臣主踢、一脚成功、</p>
<p>李義臣再立一功　東華旣勝兩球後、軍威益熾、敵軍雖數次反攻、皆被陸鍾恩跳前嚴拒、過此直至完塲、全在東華壓迫之下、斯時敵門十步之内、幾爲兩軍交鋒之區、兩軍交綏正酣之時、曹秋亭脚頭有靈、突將球傳交陳洪光、向敵人内地衝入、再遞與李義臣、李邁進數步、右脚起處敵門遂告陷落、迨完塲遂以三對○、大勝全菲選手隊、</p>

<h3>「抄靶子」</h3>
<p>— 旅隼</p>
<p>中國究竟是文明最古的地方，也是素重人道的國度，對於人，是一向非常重視的。至於偶有凌辱誅戮，那是因爲這些東西並不是人的緣故。皇帝所誅者，「逆」也，官軍所剿者，「匪」也，　子手所殺者，「犯」也。滿洲人「入主中夏」，不久也就染了這樣的淳風，雍正皇帝要除掉他的弟兄，就先行御賜改稱爲「阿其那」與「塞思黑」，我不懂滿洲話，譯不明白，大約是「猪」和「狗」罷。黃巢造反，以人爲糧，但若説他吃人，是不對的，他所吃的物事，呌作「兩脚羊」。時候是二十世紀，地方是上海，雖然骨子裏永遠是「索重人道」，但表面上當然會有些不同的。對於中國的有一部分並不是「人」的生物，洋大人如何赐謚，我不得而知，我僅知道洋大人的下屬們所給與的名目。假如你常在租界的路上走，有時總會遇見幾個穿制服的同胞和一位異胞（也往往没有這一位），用手槍指住你，搜查全身和所拿的物件。倘是白種，是不會指住的，黃種呢，如果被指的説是日本人，就放下手槍，請他走過去，獨有文明最古的黃帝子孫，可就「則不得免焉」了，。這在香港，呌作「搜身」，倒也還不算很失了體統，然而上海則竟謂之「抄靶子」。</p>
<p>抄者，搜也，靶子是該用槍打的東西，我從前年九月以來，才知道這名目的的確。四萬萬靶子，都排在文明最古的地方，私心在徼倖的只是還没有被打着。洋大人的下屬，實在給他的同胞們定了絕好的名稱。</p>
<p>然而我們這些「靶子」們，自己互相推舉起來的時候却還要客氣。我不是「老上海」，不知道上海漢上先前的相駡，彼此是怎樣賜謚的了。但看看記載，還不過是「曲辮子」，「阿木林」。「壽頭碼子」雖然已經是「猪」的隱語，然而究竟還是隱語，含有寗「雅」而不「達」的高誼。若夫現在，則只要被他認爲對於他不大恭順，他便圓睜了綻着紅筋的兩眼，擠尖喉嚨，和口角的白沬同時噴出兩個字來道：猪玀！</p>
<h3>困</h3>
<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>被或人的一個陰險的計劃，一日熊失去了他的自由。他被關入一個不夠他連打兩個滾的小天地中。他看到他的天地以外的天地，他想越出那界限，他便撲過去，可是他的頭給鐵栅撞了回來。他受了創傷，身的與心的。他蹲着。他凝望着他的天地以外的天地。他望了又撲，撲了又望。他是那樣地重複着，直到經騐阻止着他。</p>
<p>起初他拒絕人爲他預備的食物。「這是侮辱，」他想。他寗可餓死。他决不吃那不是自己費力追逐來的東西。「這樣用一些牛肉和幾顆麵包來做人家的自由的代價，多無恥！」他憤恨着。</p>
<p>可是他的逐漸增加着的饑餓使他發慌，他的眼睛在爆着火星。他要自己去找尋食物。他又望到鐵栅。他徘徊着。他不自主地向那牛肉和麵包瞟了一眼。他在那牛肉和麵包的四周打旋。他又瞟了它們一眼。他突然撲過去，彷彿它們是活的兎子或别的什麽會逃跑似地。</p>
<p>這樣一天天，一次次過去，他的崛强似乎完全消失了。他安於那小天地，彷彿那小天地就是他的原來的天地！他不再想到那鐵栅以外的天地去了。食物來，他就吃；不來，他等着，他知道總會來的，彷彿他是人世間最有耐心的生物似地。</p>
<p>他最氣憤的是有的孩子，甚至有時大人，用花生之類的東西來引逗他。他並不喜歡吃那些東西，可是可藉此聊解無聊，他總是被引誘前去，或者以爪去受，或者張口待擲。他感到他自己的可憐相。「我總有一個個吃掉你們自己的一天！」在氣憤之餘他只有這樣自解。他設法自解，以便使他安於他的小天地中。</p>
<h3>讀毁滅大衆本</h3>
<p>— 林翼之</p>
<p>這是人慌馬亂的年頭，一切都渾沌一片，一切都黑暗一團，兇毒的現實實在使人忍無可忍，而它又是「萬花撩亂」的呌你不知怎樣去認識，去把握，去改變；爲着求認識，要求文化的呼聲便與帝國主義的砲聲同樣澈響，特别是初歷社會的靑年，和一向被丢在無智的暗隅中的大衆。適應着這個要求，在一切工商業都不景氣的今日，書舖子却顯呈了變態的發展。但是陳列在四馬路玻璃窗裏的那些五花八門的出版物，到底有幾本能夠眞正的帮助這些人去認識現實呢？這便難以回答了。</p>
<p>爲着受了比自己幼稚些年靑些的朋友的委託，我老是在四馬路上徬徨半天，而終於帶着一雙空手回去，這種痛苦，我想是很普遍的；那末，今天我買到這本毁滅大衆本的歡喜，也是很容易想像的了。</p>
<p>讀法捷耶夫的名作毁滅，這是第三次。第一次，我讀日本藏原唯人的譯本，感得很大的興</p>
<p>味，這兒我發見了許多活生生的人物，並不是陌生的俄羅斯人，而是很熟悉的自己周圍的，天天可以在生活中見到的人，也有朋友，甚至連自己都在書裏邊。這種興味在許多世界名著中常常可以遇到，但法捷耶夫所寫的却是我們自己所處的這個時代。於是梅迪克就覺得比羅亭更眞切，萊文生也比浮十德更活躍，木羅式加更比唐吉訶德熟悉得多。這一類藝術的人物典型，在中國我們祗有在水滸紅樓等書中看到一點，現代作品中，似乎直到現在還祗有一個阿Q。許多寫作品製藝術的人，大半有個老規矩，兩種人，一種善，一種惡，而且都是天生的，到死也不變。但是在現實中却不是這樣的，萊文生内心也有動搖，結果還是邁步前進，梅迪克常常很義憤，又常常臨陣脱逃，所以毁滅寫的是現實。當時我讀了這作品，就想到許多不能讀到的中國讀者，幸而不久就有了魯迅先生的譯本。第二次讀這中讀本，打破了許多在日譯本中所感到的困難和阻碍。魯迅先生的譯筆確已盡了至善的努力，但是介紹給朋友，還有許多訴苦説讀不下去的。中國的文化世紀和歐美隔離得太遠了，連大學生都祗會看那些庸欲的，千篇一律的三角四角以至無數角的戀愛小説，你有什麽辦法呢？但現在辦法是有了，那便是像這本毁滅大衆本那樣把名著大衆化。我第三次讀了這大衆本，至少是爲着託我買書的靑年，我感得異常的喜歡。把一部十多萬字的著作縮成了三萬字，但是幾個重要人物的面影，整個故事發展的筋路，大致都能夠完整的保存。使那些消受不起高級藝術的人，也有機會聞一聞氣息，還功蹟决不是那些編文學講話，小説指導的先生所可比擬的。要產生帮助認識現實，把握現實，改變現實的大藝術，没有現成可襲的遺產，而翻譯又不能大衆化的今日，我學得這工作是可實貴的，但是眞正能够把高級作品大衆化的人，必須是眞正能够理解高級作品的人，否則活剝生宰，變成一個失了生命的殭屍，那纔是無限罪過。</p>
<h3>閩西山歌之轉變</h3>
<p>— 鐵生</p>
<p>閩西一帶，田少山多，一般人民，生活異常困難。因爲有了這種原因，所以數年來騷動頻仍，無時或息。</p>
<p>查閩西一帶的人民，多爲「客人」。「客人」的山歌，是很聞名的，他們的愛情，他們的希望，他們的窮困，他們的抑鬱，都可以由他們的山歌裏面表現出來。我們可以説：山歌是他們整個生活的反映。</p>
<p>記得六年前，閩西的農民最初騷動的時候，還曾利用山歌，當做宣傳的工具，什麽；「我不講來你不知，（讀如低音）騷動時間已到哩！建設我們的政府，斧頭鐮子XX旗」聽説這種宣傳確實收了不少的效果。</p>
<p>現在距離騷動的時間，已經五六年，在這麽長久的動亂中，人民當然較前更爲痛苦，然而他們的思想，則已經大爲變更，我們由下列幾首山歌中，便可窺見一斑。譬如；</p>
<p>「母親大人晤使愁，兒在外邊做伙頭，</p>
<p>每月工錢二塊半，將來一定有出頭。」</p>
<p>在這首山歌裏面，一方面是想安慰他的母親，另一方面則又表示出像這麽下賤的工作，這麽稀少的工錢，將來那裏會有出頭的日子？又如：</p>
<p>「住在山中怕猴哥，住在鄉間怕土豪，</p>
<p>住在店中怕老板，住在家中怕阿婆。」</p>
<p>在這裏又表示着無論什麽地方，都是壓制他們或她們的惡魔，她們或他們除了努力抗爭以外，是别無辦法的。此外，由下面兩首山歌，則又可看出一般婦女是如何憎恨保衛團的團丁，而和團丁敵對的人們表示好感。如；</p>
<p>「半山崗上造凉亭，戀郎切莫戀團丁！</p>
<p>鷄牛猪鴨要抽税，油鹽茶米過釐金！」</p>
<p>「戀郎切莫戀團丁，戀到團丁笑煞人！</p>
<p>X軍未來先溜走，X軍一走惡猩猩！」</p>
<p>像這種山歌，眞是多到不可勝數！這種通俗歌謠在思想方面的轉變，我以爲是很値得注意的。</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— Julei　Kenero林取作譯</p>
<p>銀幣（一）續</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚是啦，媽媽。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的我不許你再説「是啦，媽媽，」不許你裝腔作勢；你當心罷，如果我聽到你低聲歌唱着，無憂無慮地學着推車人在齒縫中吹哨時，你就　了。我是不許你沾染這些惡習的？</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚在花園裏的路上慢慢地走着。他嗟嘆着。他稍爲尋一尋，又討厭地放下了。當他覺得他的母親在注視他時，他便站着不動，彎下身子，用指尖在草和細砂裏間翻覓着。等他覺得雷辟克家的已經瞳開了時，便不再尋找了。他仰着頭，繼續走着。</p>
<p>這個銀幣究竟在什麽地方呢？難道在那裏，在樹上，在那老鳥巢裏面？</p>
<p>有時候一些並不在尋覓什麽東西的粗心的人，倒發見了金錢。這事是有人見到的。可是紅蘿蔔鬚在地上滾着，用着他的膝和爪，却不能尋到一隻逼針。</p>
<p>懶得徘徊了，懶得無目的地希望了，紅蘿蔔鬚便放下了那事，决定回到屋子裏去看看他母親的情形再説。也許她已平靜下去了，也許因爲那貨幣尋不到，她也就算了。</p>
<p>他没有看見雷辟克家的。他呌着她，輕輕地。</p>
<p>「媽媽，啊！媽媽！」</p>
<p>媽媽没有回答。她剛剛出去了，她讓她那做針線的桌子的抽斗大開着在。在那些毛繩，針，白的，紅的，黑的線團裏面，紅蘿蔔鬚看見有幾個銀幣。</p>
<p>這些銀幣就像老在那裏似的。它們好似睡在那裏，狠少被人驚醒過，由這個角落推到那個角落，混亂在一塊，看不出究竟有多少。</p>
<p>像祗有三四個，又像有七八個。這是狠不易計算的。非把抽斗翻轉來，淸出那些線團不可。並且就算出來了，又有什麽證據呢？</p>
<p>帶着那種祗在重要塲合才會失去的機智，紅蘿蔔鬚下着决心，伸出手臂，偷了一個貨幣逃走了。</p>
<p>那種害怕被人碰到的心情，使得他没有躊　，懊悔，冒着危險再回到桌子那邊去的餘裕。他直往外跑，走得太急了，簡直停不住脚，他走遍花園，尋出一塊適宜的地方，把錢丢下，用脚踏在土裏，自己倒下去，肚子貼着地睡着，鼻子被靑草弄得癢癢的，他亂爬着，盡着一些不規則的圓圈，正像和一羣小孩子頑要的時候，眼睛被包住了，圍着那藏着的物件打圈子，同時指揮這遊戲的人在焦急的拍着腿子呌説：</p>
<p>「當心啦！不要燙痛啊，不要燙痛啊！」</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚媽媽，媽媽，我找到了。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的我也找到了。（未完）</p>

<h3>糧食米市天雨漲角砠</h3>

<h3>標粉麥一落千丈</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份竟發生巨大之跌風、最低之新低價、旣復陸續產生、而跌風之猛烈、又出多數人意料之外、以洋麥之報價、坎麥曾回漲三四角、美麥不動、時雨又見大沛、　常理相衡、自少暴落之可能、不過業内外之人心、則因新麥已旺、廠家之存底、亦復湧積、由事實上之不能週旋、市氣遂難互擯、本月份因月底已近、多頭均亟於脱手、開價後市氣卽告不穩、遠期亦因頻頻脱手、大部分又因繳證困難、不得不粉粉濫税、廠家方面、亦有出檔、市氣遂一瀉千里、迨至下午開盤、以大廠盡力抛售、不論近遠、均有暢出、客户多頭、遂致大殺、查下午之最低價、六七月份均至二元二角六分、八月份至二元二角八分、九月份至二元三角、十月份至二元三角四分、十一月份至二元三角七分半、旋因大跌之後、遂稍回漲、結果本月份較前週暴跌五分七厘半、七月份跌五分七厘半、八月份跌六分、九月份跌五分二厘半、十月份跌五分、十一月份跌六分半、</p>
<p>麥市上下午開盤後、各月份均一致呈暴跌之象、以新麥已經旺令、本埠廠家及内地廠家、均以洋麥尙　、對於新麥均無暢收之意思、而各路到貨、則已陸續轉旺、在此環境之下、彷彿受實貨所壓迫、致多頭之氣、步步打擊、毫無重振之餘勇、所以上下兩市、初已不佳、後又</p>
<p>爲粉所激動、遂大跌不已、七月份小至三元七角九分、八月份至三元八角八分、九月份跌破四元、低至三元九角七分、最後結果七八月份均跌九分、九月份跌八分、十十一月份跌九分、現麥交易、　面上交易不多、祗開特高黃橋麥五百包、價跌至三元七角、惟聞塲外交易亦有二三千包、高貨低至三元六角左右、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>一個救國方案</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>救國人人會救，各有巧妙不同，例如「念經救國」，「讀書救國」，「跳舞救國」，「玉容救國」，「治心救國」，「體育救國」，「節衣縮食救國」，「航空救國」等等，倘欲詳細的開上一張救國菜單；大槪不止二三十種，救國之道誠多矣哉！</p>
<p>但這些都是治標而不是治本的方法，丨丨雖然「治心救國」有點近於治本，但爲什麽要有這顆心，爲什麽要等到這顆心起了毛病才去「治」，那都是很費思量的事，小子無能，窮思冥想，想於各項救國運動之外，特創一種治本的方法，以自附熱鬧，而盡個人厥責，但究因缺乏創造天才，自國難發生以來，思索至今，已過了一年又九閲月，並未草成半個方案，説來頗自慚愧，徼天之倖，我也有報國的一日了，昨天偶讀某報，載有哈瓦斯社六日維也納電一條，不禁雀躍，原文錄下：</p>
<p>格拉茲城有「無政府主義著作家葛羅斯曼倡「消滅生殖能力」之説·秘密設立醫院多處，雇用大學醫科學生若干人，爲之服役，前來問津者，類爲窮窶之工人，因食指日繁，不勝負累，登葛氏之門，納費若干，由醫科學生爲之施行手術，以消滅其生殖能力，葛氏營業，蒸蒸日上，不幸爲警察所破獲，首從各犯，　　入獄</p>
<p>創造雖無方，抄襲却有術，從實説來，翻譯之功，原不下於創作，我看丁這一節電文之後，不禁欽佩萬分，雖然這一位「無政府主義著作家」的主旨，在解决他們的社會問題，但我覺得這個發明，實在具世界性，有輸入而列爲救國　本大計之一的必要，現在將我　　　　，説明如下</p>
<p>第一國難的嚴重，與國之須當救，大槪已無疑義，但國之所以不易救，原因就在於這一般「窮窶的工人」以及窮窶的農民，因爲食指日繁，自己「不勝負累」又不懂「消滅生殖能力」的學説，所以想到向可以「負累」的人算賬一着上去，此風一啓，便不可復遏，東也算賬，西也索欠，弄得「民盡匪化」（見最近報載江西來電）不勝「圍炸」之勞，這豈止當局者引爲抱歉，也是民务我負疚的事，至於這班「窮窶」的人，因不懂得禁止，或消滅「食指」的增加，以致一禍延本身」實亦至可憐憫的事，故「消滅生殖能力」學説的提倡，實爲當前救國的根本方法，倘能將未來無窮數候補「窮窶」者產生的機能消滅了，這一般現存的「窮窶」者，是不怕不有死盡的一日的，到那時候社館上賸了淸一色的「富有」者，自能達到「共存共榮」的地位了，葛羅斯曼功績，豈不休哉。</p>
<p>至於他用營榮的「蒸蒸日上」而由「無政府主義者」一變而爲全球聞名的資本家，自是意料中的事，所可慮者，中國「窮窶的工人」未知能否納這「若干」的費，倒是一個問題，好在提倡者爲國家社館前途着想，一定能結予種種方便，丨丨如免費等等，决不致如維也納的警察那樣的不講情理，丨丨這多少要比調動大洋四五十萬，月費千六百萬餘元，而做不了半邊工作的要省事啊！</p>
<h3>同居的女兒</h3>
<p>— 蘋</p>
<p>窗外飄着雨絲，天氣頓然轉凉，在燈下讀書，竟像初秋的樣樣。微驚徨失措地來叩我小樓的門，我呆視着他，以爲他發生了什麽意外；而微却抓起烟罐中的紙烟，燃着後，儘自抽烟，好像他忘了坐在我的小樓中：同時忘了我是在等候他雨夜來訪的理由。</p>
<p>「怎樣一回事？」我終於忍不住打破了小樓的寥寂。</p>
<p>今夜和你同舖。微毫不在乎的回答。</p>
<p>「阿×知道嗎？」這樣平凡的事，我打玩笑了。</p>
<p>「正爲了她丨」他抛了手中的烟，嚴肅地説：「我明天要搬家！」</p>
<p>意料中的事，竟在意外的雨夜發生。</p>
<p>微是個孤獨的人，三千里外的家庭早已忘却了她。我們因爲從前同居的關係，各人在相認識之後，就變成了眞</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>逆。去年舊居遭了火難，急於尋新居，就分住開來。而我是懶於搬家的，在這小樓住下來之後，再不想搬動，况且我們的新居還近，所以就此因循下來。</p>
<p>本偷偷地降臨到人間的一天，吃過午餐，我照例挾着一本書，約他去同遊法國公園，却意外的在他房裏發現了一位女子。她，修長的身材，大方的舉止，説話時老是媚笑着，我知道微是不善於交際的，他更痛恨女子，朋友們講着女人的故事，他惟有抓着紙捲狂抽。那天看她們的交誼，不像一朝一夕相遇的，「或者是他的親戚吧？」我正這樣想的時候，他給我介紹是同居的袁女士。</p>
<p>微和袁女士　識之後，他的人生觀完全更變。他像朝露中野草，放肆的滋長。朋友們見這孤獨者能遇着這樣的如意事，也分外快活。假日，傍晚，他的房中常聚滿朋友，任意談笑，袁女士也從不避開，年靑人總是年靑人，在這樣場合，忘懷了各自的痛苦，社會的壓榨，這裏是高談，狂歌，微奏着那隻流行的歌曲：</p>
<p>熱情麻木了疲丨倦，</p>
<p>戀愛充實了空丨虚：</p>
<p>人們只有找到愛丨</p>
<p>纔算不是空過一世。</p>
<p>一陣鼓掌，我們偷看袁女士，微笑停留在她的嘴角邊。</p>
<p>這樣兩個月像流水般的過去，却發生了一件事。微探明袁女士的母親是人家的側室，而且已被遺棄，不過每個月還有幾十元的津貼。她的母親是抽烟的，區區的幾十元當然不夠她們的開消，於是微偵得她們帶來的内侄，已是她的臨時女婿了。在初戀的愛河中的微，他的苦痛當然是明顯的事實，我們變次勸他離開了阿Ｘ丨袁女士的小名丨吧。這種消極的辦法，不能補他苦痛於萬一。</p>
<p>這密幕揭開之後，各方都是難堪的，而更有意外的事，在窗外飄着雨絲的晚上發生。</p>
<p>微才開始講他的突變：「阿Ｘ的母親要到大世界去，我因爲雨天辭謝了；而Ｘ也是説頭痛不去。九點過後，我預備就寢的阿Ｘ穿了竅衣，到我房裏。她讓到我的懷中來，哭着告訴她母親的不良，因爲没有機會和我細説，她是十分愛着我，她這時候的舉止意外的放浪，我在迷夢中頓然驚醒過來，推開她的身體，冒雨跑出門，兩條黑影在後門口徘徊，同時在弄口遇見了她的母親」</p>
<p>窗外飄着雨絲，這故事就在雨聲中閉幕。</p>

<h3>家兄的私債</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>家兄得楚，在民國十七年，入贅於陳姓。後集資開設米行；因交友不愼，終日在外，撣金如土。以至行内虧欠甚巨，並有私收客賬情事。今有楊姓債主，已在二月中起訴，開庭數次；傳票等向由陳姓收受，未曾到庭。故即缺廣判决，但家兄迄今避不見面。昨日又有傳票到陳姓處，未曾接受，而領至鄙人處；但鄙人當然拒絕。此後鄙人對於法律上。有無關係？請在店員通信欄内，給我一個相當的答覆。</p>
<p>王逸才謹上</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸ</p>
<p>編者按：我國現行法律，對於各個人的債務，規定由各個人負責。照來信看來，令兄對於楊姓的債務，完全是他的私債。要是你當時並未做過中保，絕對没有責任之可言；非但是你，就是陳姓，也不會牽連的。令兄雖出走，法院自有救濟辦法；可以下令緝捕。下次要是再有傳票來，你大可注上一筆，申明無法轉遞，就完事了。</p>

<h3>紅綠燈下（五）</h3>
<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>（四）打仗眞討厭呢！李先生，是不是？</p>
<p>亭子間李先生房裏來了兩位從江灣逃出砲火的同學，目的是想來公居李先生這間小房子暫時避難的，但是他們的情緒却被戰爭所興奮着。一進來那姓張名洪烈的便憤憤然説道：</p>
<p>「日本矮鬼太可惡了，他們的什麽四項無理的條件，市政府當局全都屈辱地承認了，而他們昨晚仍然强暴地向閘北開始襲擊，你没有去看，閘北的那些民衆連逃都來不及，中國也太不爭氣了！」另一個周紹平搶着説：</p>
<p>「現在也好，旣然打起來也好，十九路軍已毅然地應戰了，中國要就在這一次亡，要就在這一戰中找得條出路來，我準備我們學校組織義勇軍，自動加入前線，石喬你認識的人很多，請助我們一臂！」</p>
<p>李石喬雖在大學畢業已兩年，長期失業的生活還幸没有冷掉他靑年的熱血，對於張周二位的興奮表示十二分的激動，這時轟轟的飛機在空中盤旋，他們的熱血也更沸騰。越是興奮着的時候，石喬越是一句話也説不出，周紹平又搶着説了：</p>
<p>「我們先走了，先去找攏幾位志同道合的同學，不然他們全都走散了不容易召集，晚上我們才得轉來到這裏睡，我和洪烈便鋪在地板上好了！」</p>
<p>「到我這裏？我要搬了，二房東要我搬！」石喬立即陰慘着臉失望地説，這種失望决不僅止於二位同學之不能來睡，而二位同學也曾在石喬閒談時揣知一二，所以他們便半謔半眞的齊聲説：</p>
<p>「二房東要你搬？你的二房東太太！可是這時候眞不凑巧，今天一打仗，外面的房錢一定加倍貴起來丨搬丨眞不容易！」</p>
<p>「我欠二房東錢已兩個月，他們並没有向我討過·要我搬的我想是昨天新租進來的一個闊老，他們大槪從閘北避難出來，一時找不到好房子，便也只好做做這裏的三房客了！但他們有的是錢，多給些房租二房東，白俄準呌我立刻搬走的，怎麽辦呢！」</p>
<p>「没有錢的人祗好屈屈頭，有錢的人連消息也靈通些，他們昨天便走避了，你得好她地向這大亨交涉，這也許是個辦法，大亨對於小事情往往是假慈悲的。至於我倆今天另外借地方就是好，明天見！」</p>
<p>周張兩個走了後，李石喬便獨自盤算怎樣和那大亨去説話，態度必得不亢不卑，最要緊的是不要使他輕視才好，他整理整理他身上穿着的一套靑嗶嘰西裝丨這是他唯一的漂亮衣服丨把褲的那條　線弄淸楚些，於是他走上幾步樓梯向大亨的房子敲門。</p>

<h3>性感是什麽？Ｗｈａｔ　ｉｓ　Ｓｅｘ　Ａｐｐｅａｌ</h3>
<p>— 引西</p>
<p>「性感」是什麽？</p>
<p>是誘惑性嗎？是生物學上的反應還是化學的混合物？爲什麽有的人有得多些而有人有得少些？是一件實在存在，有生命的東西呢，還是好萊塢製造出來作爲銷售影片的術語？可以不可以加以界説，還是牠過於空洞了，無法加以解釋的？有没有明白牠，還是大家不過猜想揣測而已？</p>
<p>以上的問題，好萊塢研究性感的專家，亦不能意見合一。閲者讀此文，但憑自己的見地，加以判决，所謂智者見智，仁者見仁也。但性感却是好萊塢最重要的一種商品，好萊塢是以出售性感而著名的。從前一個女子要有迷惑性，引誘力，要有情感而有興趣，可是現在牠祇要講究如何能有ＳＡ這就是性感（Ｓｅｘ　Ａｐｐｅａｌ）的縮寫，現在通行極了。男人亦是如此。倘是克拉克蓋博没有性感，他祗可以做木塲裏的苦工，葛萊泰嘉實没有了，祗可以做理髮所裏的女招待，傑姆斯多蘭没有了，祇可以在街上賣花生米。</p>
<p>性感和美貎，可以説是没有多大關係的。好萊塢最富於性感的幾位明星，都不是有什麽面容美的。性感和曲線，亦没有什麽連屬的。譬方説葛萊泰嘉寳，牠旣没有動人的面貎，亦没有苗條的曲線，但是牠却性感到極點。那末性感到底是什麽？</p>
<p>媽媽擲下了碟子和杯子，跑出去看詹姆斯喀格耐；爸爸偷偷兒揚開窗簾張望廣告牌　梅威絲特名名字：這都是性感。</p>
<p>發明地心吸力的是牛頓；發明性感的是伊琳諾格林（Ｅｌｉｎｏｒ　Ｇｌｙｎ）。牠替克萊拉寳起了一個譯號，呌ｉｔ　Ｇｉｒｌ。於是這（ｉｔ）就轟動了世界，風靡了一時。但是不知道那一位好　了徒，又將「衣脱」送到了學裏去，受了些高等敎育，牠就變成了現在的ＳＡ了。</p>
<p>名導演　别謙説「兩個加兩個，變成四個；但是説到了性感，就没有這樣便當了。你遇見了一個人，你愛上他了，什麽緣故？你自己去想吧。我所知道的就是你倘須要作些事業，你非有牠不可。無論你是油　家，著作家，馬路英雄，都得有些性感纔興。就是一個滑稽家，要是没有性感，就不成其爲滑稽了。可是你倘使有了這個性感，那是你無論怎麽樣，也掩蓋不了的。有人説希佛萊的性感，在他的聲音。但是，誰能説他的ＳＡ不在他的眼睛，他手的動作，他的走路，他的撇嘴？」</p>
<p>性感到底是什麽？</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>評「現代一女性」</h3>
<p>— 嘉南</p>
<p>金錢，戀愛，刺戟是每個所謂現代女性所認爲急切的需要。她們爲了這許多而拚命的嘗試，結果抵觸了法律破壞了道德，最後的收穫，仍舊是，空虚。這種情形，艾小姐在她的寫作裏早介紹給我們過。在這片裏也給有們我同樣的認識，</p>
<p>Ｋｉｓｓ在舶來片中，是極平常的一回事，但在國產片中除掉幾幕不自然的擁抱外，熱烈的動作，僅有白幕中黑影的暗示。在這裏艾小姐的勇氣，的確可使人欽佩。</p>
<p>的確，全劇導演的技巧，演員的認眞，佈影的美麗等，都顯有了長足的進步，像本刋和别的電影刋物，早已表揚過，我現在要説的是另外的幾點</p>
<p>已墮落了的女性，轉移至「海闊天空」的新的途徑是全劇的最緊要的中心，可是這片裏的後部似乎大輕了些。萄萄在那時除掉一度搖幾圈襪機外，其餘都憑字幕來代替動作，而且她轉變的中間人的女革命家也只在字幕上對白、好像她們只記得在舞台上而忘記了這是電影似的</p>
<p>孫敏扮演紈袴子弟是最適合，所以他在這片裏的成功是應該的，可是他本代表了一個意志薄弱的靑年，最後連接萄萄在牢裏寄出三封信而竟不睬理，像又意志很堅强了，但末了他又會頽廢，酖樂，沉淪，這一點似乎是矛盾的</p>
<p>還有幾個小疵點，不過這許多多是不十分緊要的小點，全劇的成功，還不會受着重大的影響</p>
<h3>觀「現代一女性」後</h3>
<p>— 徐海容</p>
<p>在　產電影中，能自己編劇自己主　　「女性」的一幕，無限深情，盡在不言中，這部片子，已定於本星期三起，在南京大戲院公映，你在這裏是找不出一個男性棶來的，</p>
<p>演的片子，我還没有看見過，有的，當然要算這張「現代一女性」了。</p>
<p>艾霞女士對於戀愛，的確是有她獨到的認識和了解，這裏她闡明了戀愛的眞諦，原來所謂戀愛，就是那麽一件無謂的事情，要片我想大可給一班戀愛狂的時代靑年男女，當作一帖淸凉散。</p>
<p>大槪關於編劇方面，艾霞女士還没有良好的經騐，所以本片在劇本上是有不少的缺陷和矛盾。萄萄轉變的突然，是最使我們覺得茫然的地方。雖然，我們仍舊是感到歡慰的，因爲艾霞女士對於吾國電影運動上一種苦鬥努力上進的精神，至少是已獲得觀衆一致的同情了。　　導演不能使我們十分滿意，疎忽的地方很多，萄萄家庭的佈置和牢獄生活的描寫，是最不妥。</p>
<h3>看「現代一女性」後</h3>
<p>— 余淑玉</p>
<p>嗜國產片如命的我，當　然對於這一張女演員自編劇本的「現代一女性」，是不肯錯過的了。但是歸來以後，至終是令我大失所望。</p>
<p>據編劇者艾霞女士自己寫的一篇介紹，這一個劇本的骨幹，原來就是她自己的寫照。好了，不論這話是否眞實，我對於這位女明星的過去歷史，却有些感慨了。</p>
<p>如果抛開了這個問題，我們可以再看一看劇本展開的内容。的確，在一般國片裏，本事永久是長長的，所以影片祇能儘一段故事舖張，而不能注意到藝術上的發展了。這張片子比較是好的，因爲牠本事很短，給導演演員技巧無數的機會，盡量的去施展本能。當然艾霞牠給自己的出風頭的地方是尤其多了。其他各種技巧，亦都是顯著的進步。</p>
<p>不過劇本太富於詩意了，所以處處感到空虚。劇旨更是怯弱無力。全片寫浪漫地方太多，以致末尾没有轉圜的方法可以使片中主人翁走上正路而只好模糊的完結。這顯然是頭重脚輕的毛病。而且命名是「現代一女性」，而劇中只表現出了一個「現代一個墮落的女性」並没有給她絲毫出路。她改正以後，雖有從事革命的思想，但亦不過一種暗示而劇中一些没有演出。在意識上，我也對她充份懷著畸缺不全这感了。</p>
<h3>「女性」裏究竟有些什麽</h3>
<p>— 深翁</p>
<p>它是一部人事的紀錄</p>
<p>在德國一班舊派人物的腦筋裏，至今還是存着一個「普魯士軍人」的觀念，没有一些革命思想·他們以爲將有一個時期，德國還得需用軍人和軍人的母親；所以在許多老腐敢的女子學府裏，一切訓練方法，均取軍隊紀律，祗知一味嚴厲壓迫，一意要把那些小姑娘們，做成了「鐵女性」，情感兩個字，是絕對談不到的。於是一班小姑娘們的活潑天眞，都被摧殘盡了。</p>
<p>這部全女性合演的名片「女性」（原名女性之光），就是因爲這個問題而攝製的。它是一部人事的紀錄，它的主張，是要揮發人類的天性，反對那機械式的生活。它的劇本，是一位女性寫的。實在説起來，也祇有一個女性才能夠寫出這樣的故事。因爲她能夠明瞭女性們的心地，她能了解女性們的苦楚，把全世界女性心靈上的忠實，完全舒展出來。對於那德國的舊式敎育，她雖然没有明目張膽去痛駡；但是後來那女學生的自殺，就很使得舊派人物難受。</p>
<p>説到演出的技巧，當然有許多地方是値得贊美的，其中尤以桃樂茜維克的敎員，罕莎茜亞莉的學生，表情最能動人。她們用内心的表演，把喜怒哀樂很明顯的流露出來，令人興奮刺激，達於極點，他如愛蜜梨翁姐的校長，也頗做得有聲有色。餘有那許多女學生們，也都能夠把各人的個性，表現出來。照各方面情形看起來，這個片子，能夠在歐美各地，得獲意外的成功，確然不是僥倖的。</p>
<h3>胡蝶頭上的支出</h3>
<p>— 墨客風</p>
<p>明星們多數是很奢華的，格外是女明星，幾元錢一尺衣料，幾十元錢的一雙襪子，她們都認爲是無甚希奇的。許淑貞的一襪二十五金，電影界中並非没有！如今我告訴你：胡蝶皇后每月單單在理髮一項的支出，須在三十元以上云。</p>
<h3>電影小説情海迴瀾Ｒｅｕｎｉｏｎ　ｉｎ　Ｖｉｅｎｎａ（七）</h3>
<p>— 子歸譯</p>
<p>「愛倫娜，我的寳貝」，魯道爾夫懇求著，「要你依順我，是很不容易的了。你大槪總想著我口袋裏的那個戒指吧。但是在我一方面，完全是和跟别人在一起不同的，你難道還不能明白嗎？我第一個先愛你，你亦愛過我。我現在求你再愛我一回兒，眞正一回兒。我並不想做你丈夫的情敵，不過你亦可以再愛我一些兒，如同你情竇初開的時候的一些回響。」他現在坐在沙發上了，但還是抱住了愛倫娜不肯放，「你爲什麽這樣倔强呢？你好像還是一個天眞爛縵的女學生，給一個飢餓的猩猩抓住了似的。你將你自己放鬆些，像從前一樣的放蕩一下。」愛倫娜果眞地笑起來了。但還是很低。</p>
<p>「你不是要我放蕩一下子嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，但我並不是呌你裝腔作態地來　衍我，」魯道爾夫很不自在地説。</p>
<p>她忽然間　轉身體，伏在他的身上，抱住了他的頭很命地吻著，如同幾分鐘前魯道爾夫吻她的一樣。</p>
<p>「唏，這眞是意想不到的事。」</p>
<p>「你想不到我會這樣快地聽你的話吧」？她説著又瘋狂似的打著他的嘴巴，又狂吻著。他已將她抱在身上。她問題「我還像氷似的冷嗎」？</p>
<p>「不了，怎樣這氷，融得這樣快？」</p>
<p>她狂吻著，狂笑著。她喊道「讓我把四面的門打開，讓他們看看我一些兒没有改變過。魯道爾夫想　止她，但她已經把門都打開了，一般老朋友都魚貫而入，歡呼著慶祝那站在桌子上的愛倫娜，那就她當年放蕩的一種。但是一回兒魯道爾夫已將她從桌上拉了下來，他們在華爾滋的樂聲中，摟抱著一起一伏地跳進那臥房裏去了。</p>
<p>外面的空氣緊張到極點了。那班人不怕死似的瘋狂著，怱然　魯道爾夫從臥房裏衝了出來，臉是暴怒得通紅，喊道「她那裏去了？你們爲什麽傻子似的站著？快去尋找她呀！快去追她呀」！他跳著脚又自怨自艾地説道「我不廳該放她一個人進浴室去的，想不到她就這樣逃走了」！</p>
<p>他决定自己去追她。老露却警告著他説門口有警察巡邏的。許多人求著他不要去，但他是不受人家阻擋的。他拿帽子拉低了，蓋在眼睛上，披了一件外　衝出去了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Central Government Hopes Feng Will Move to Wanquan</h3>
<p>Feng Has Not Yet Expressed a Concrete Position on the Forest and Land Reclamation Directorship; Song Zheyuan's Trip to Chahar Awaits the Return of Representatives from Beiping (Beiping) The order appointing Feng Yuxiang as the Forest and Land Reclamation Director can be issued within days. The authorities hope Feng will move to Wanquan County, so that Song Zheyuan can focus on reorganizing Chahar's military and administration. The authorities plan to appoint Fang Zhenwu as the co-director of the Forest and Land Reclamation, and his troops will be reorganized into Forest and Land Reclamation police, but the quota is quite limited. The various volunteer armies, including Deng Wen's troops, will still be reorganized by Song, and appropriate defense areas will be assigned. Tang's troops will still be under the command of He Sui. The troops of Ji Hongchang and Tong Linge will be reorganized into two divisions, under the command of Song Zheyuan. Sun's troops are awaiting the issuance of the order to go to Qinghai for land reclamation. Song will leave Beiping for Chahar after Feng expresses his agreement with the post-disaster arrangements. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, Song Zheyuan convened Qin Dechun, Zhang Jiyong and others for a meeting, and also spoke with Feng's chief of staff, Qiu Shanning, via long-distance telephone. It was decided to send Zhang Jiyong to Zhangjiakou with Feng's representative, Lei Jishang, on the morning of the 20th to meet Feng for further consultations. Song then went to Guanyintang to summon all the officers for a lecture, and personally inspected the garrison locations. He will schedule a trip to Chahar after the representatives return to Beiping, and order his troops to concentrate on the Ping-Sui Railway line and open up the Zhangjiakou area. Pang's troops will open up southern Chahar to connect with Sun's defense area. Troops stationed in Changping and Shahe are preparing to return to Suiyuan. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to sources, Feng Yuxiang has not yet expressed a concrete position on the Forest and Land Reclamation Directorship. Some people suggest that to accommodate Feng's wishes, the director's office should be located in Wanquan County, thirty miles northeast of Zhangjiakou, with a monthly allocation of 30,000 yuan in regular expenses. After Feng sends a telegram to abolish the name of the Allied Army, the central government's order will be issued immediately. There is also talk of Fang Zhenwu being appointed as a co-director, and his troops being reorganized into Forest and Land Reclamation police, but reducing their number. In the future, Feng's troops will be reorganized by Song into two divisions under Song's command. Other volunteer armies and the remnants of Tang Yulin's troops will be reorganized and then transferred for defense, still under the command of He Sui. On the 19th, Song sent Zhang Jiyong and Liu Zhizhou to Zhangjiakou again to meet Feng to discuss unresolved issues in detail. He will lead his troops back to Chahar after receiving a reply from Zhang. (19th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu's Talk to the Press</h3>

He has no opinions on the current situation, and only knows to obey the central government and maintain the local area. His slogan is to "suppress the communist bandits internally and resist the powers externally." China is like a broken teacup, and even if the handle is intact, it is useless. We must find another way out to remedy the situation. Shandong province is quiet. The central government hopes that Feng will move to Wanquan County. It is heard that Shi Yousan is now in Qinhuangdao. He will definitely return to Jinan tonight or tomorrow morning. (19th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>President Wang Cables Various Provinces and Cities to Provide Relief to the North China War Zone</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Executive Yuan President Wang cabled various provincial and municipal governments a few days ago, and cabled various charitable organizations in Shanghai on the 19th, requesting them to raise funds to provide relief to the North China war zone. The original text of the two cables is recorded below: (1) To all provincial and municipal governments, in view of the fact that in the recent military operations in North China, the counties of Luan East and Ji North were in the path of battle, the people either suffered tragic casualties or were burdened with heavy supplies. In addition, the war occurred during the spring plowing season, and the rural areas suffered particularly severely. Now that the war has come to an end, a committee should be properly established to be responsible for raising funds to handle relief matters in the North China war zone, distribute emergency relief, and restore the rural areas. All of this requires huge sums of money. Since the people of North China have sacrificed for our entire nation, all relief funds should also be borne by the entire nation. In addition to the allocation of funds from the central government, each provincial and municipal government should actively find ways to quickly raise huge sums of money and remit them directly to the North China War Zone Relief Committee for storage and use. The progress of compliance should still be reported for verification. Executive Yuan President Wang Zhaoming, seal. (2) To the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Association for Relief of Northeastern Refugees, Xiong Bingsan and all gentlemen, I have read your telegram. North China has suffered greatly from the recent war, and the rural areas have been devastated. Relief should be rushed. The 108th meeting of this Yuan decided to establish a special committee to be responsible for raising funds for relief matters in the North China war zone. Regarding relief funds, a principle has been decided that the government and the banking community will each raise 10 million yuan. Concrete measures are being drafted. Your association is concerned about the people's suffering and has always been admired. I hope that you will unite all sectors of society to find good strategies to save the country from this great disaster. This is what I pray for. Executive Yuan President Wang Zhaoming, seal. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>President Wang Cables Congratulations on the Establishment of the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee</h3>
<p>"To Cherish the People with Kindness, to Govern Officials with Strictness, to Jointly Express Loyalty and Strategy to Save the Great Calamity"</p>

Only if all of you cherish the people with kindness, govern officials with strictness, and break through all obstacles with integrity and courage can the crisis be turned into safety. As far as I, your humble brother, am able, I will respectfully do my best to assist you sincerely. I hope that we can jointly express our loyalty and strategy to save the great calamity. I am sending this telegram with endless prayers. Wang Zhaoming, seal. (19th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>The Puppet Army Robs the Administration of Various Counties</p>
<h3>Colluding with the Puppet Fengshan Railway to Operate Qin-Tang Trains</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The puppet army in eastern Luan has recently become rampant and has robbed the administration of various counties. All county magistrates and public security chiefs of various counties have been replaced by personnel sent by the puppet army. Recently, the rebel Li Jichun also appointed the traitor Liu Jinbiao as the Director of the Department of Political Affairs, who has already established an office in Qinhuangdao to administer the various counties in eastern Luan. He also appointed Liu Junfeng as the Director of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, and colluded with the puppet Fengshan Railway to operate passenger and freight trains between Qin and Tang, controlling the railway administration. It has now extended to Tianzhuang, only ten kilometers from Lutai. Moreover, the military discipline is very bad, and robberies occur from time to time. The residents are under the oppression and cannot bear the disturbance. (19th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Yongjin Telegrams the Japanese Military Headquarters for Instructions</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Although the Japanese side has stated that it will not interfere with the issue of the disposal of the puppet army, no post-disaster arrangements can be carried out before the Japanese army is completely withdrawn. Our side has formulated several principles for resolving the puppet army and has already sent a telegram to the Kwantung Army Headquarters in Changchun via Yongjin for instructions. No reply has been received yet, so the resolution will have to wait for a day or two. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Puppet Army Harasses Wanzhuang and its Vicinity</h3>
<p>(Beiping) At about 1:00 am on the 17th, a dozen or so puppet soldiers were discovered in the Wanzhuang area east of Lutai, harassing us and killing one of our sentries. They were repelled after our army fought back. Yesterday and today have been peaceful. The puppet soldier Zhao Lei is still stationed in Ninghe City. The rumor that he went to Xugezhuang is not accurate. (19th Special Telegram)</p>

County Magistrate Su has reported this for instructions. (19th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japan Decides to Abolish the Right of Extraterritoriality in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Forcing the United States and Britain to Abandon it Together</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic circles, the Japanese side recently invited representatives of the puppet organizations' internal affairs, foreign affairs, and judicial departments to discuss the issue of abolishing the right of extraterritoriality, and has decided on the principle of abolishing it. The puppet representatives firmly demanded that Japan implement the abolition within six months or a year, which was also agreed to by the Japanese side. It is heard that the Japanese side's activities are extremely poisonous. On the one hand, they can express goodwill to the puppet organization and win people's hearts. On the other hand, after Japan abandons the right of extraterritoriality, it can also force the United States and Britain to abandon it together, so that all power in the Eastern Provinces is entirely in the hands of the Japanese side.

<h3>It is Feared that Sun Dianying's Appointment as Head of Qinghai will be Difficult to Realize</h3>
<p>Minzhu'er's Remarks (Nanjing) Minzhu'er, the representative of Zhangjia Hutuktu, said that reports that the central government appointed Sun Dianying as the Director of Land Reclamation in Qinghai and concurrently as the chairman, etc., are probably not true. Qinghai is located on the border and has a very complex ethnic composition. The reason why there has been peace for the past twenty years is that the governance has been entrusted to the right person. After the September 18th Incident, Manchuria and Mongolia were invaded by Japan, but the Mongolian people in Qinghai have not wavered, also because the governance has been entrusted to the right person. After the Tibetan-Qinghai affair, the Mongolian and Tibetan people have always regarded supporting the central government and obeying the provincial government as their duty, so the incident has not escalated to this day. At a time when the national crisis is severe and ethnic groups are volatile, how should the central government appease the border people and consolidate national defense? If Sun Dianying is appointed to Qinghai, the Chahar affair can certainly be resolved, but it is feared that disputes will arise in Qinghai Province again. Moreover, Qinghai is cold and the only land that can be cultivated is along the Yellow River. The rest is nomadic land for Mongolians and Tibetans. The climate is not suitable for cultivation and there is no way to reclaim land. Therefore, I speculate that this matter will not be realized. (19th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Three Highways are Scheduled to Open to Traffic</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Economic Commission's construction of the Beijing-Wuwei, Xuan-Chang, and Su-Jia highways, which connect seven provinces, has been completed one after another. The opening ceremonies are now scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 24th for the Beijing-Wuwei highway, in Xuancheng on the 25th for the Xuan-Chang highway, and in Suzhou on the 28th for the Su-Jia highway. A person in charge of the commission told reporters on the 19th that the three highways were started in the 18th year of the Republic and were handled by the authorities of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces. Later, due to the impact of the Shenyang Incident and the Shanghai Incident, work was suspended one after another. The National Economic Commission then supervised and advanced huge amounts of money, which finally led to the completion. The Beijing-Wuwei and Xuan-Chang highways are 92 kilometers long, and the earth base is about 9 meters wide. The entire line was completed at the beginning of this month, but the bridge project on the Dahe River in Dangtu County has not yet been completed. The Xuan-Chang highway runs from Xuancheng, Anhui to Changxing, Zhejiang, and is 124 kilometers long. Merchants from Anhui and Zhejiang are contracted to handle transportation. The Su-Jia highway passes through Suzhou, Wuhu, and Jiaxing in Zhejiang, either through mining areas or agricultural land. After the opening of traffic, it will greatly benefit the rural economy.

<h3>Gan Naiguang Reports on the Trend of Internal Affairs Administration</h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters Memorial Week (Nanjing) At 8:00 am on the 19th, the central government held a memorial week. Gu Mengyu presided over the meeting. Gan Naiguang reported on "The Recent Trends in Internal Affairs Administration," stating in essence that there are currently three trends in administration: (1) To promote according to all plans is called "active politics"; (2) To make arguments against the previous theory is what Hu Shih called "laissez-faire politics"; (3) To organize the current chaotic situation and make it consistent with scientific methods can be called "organizing politics." The administrative plans we are currently taking are all focused on organizing, removing the old habits and complexities. The steps are nothing more than (1) organizing the organs themselves to make them perfect; (2) then drafting perfect laws and regulations to improve and promote the lower levels; (3) after organizing, then talk about the system and policies. We will proceed according to these steps. The meeting adjourned at 9:00 am. (19th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Industry Plans to Establish a Jiangxi Tungsten Ore Sales Bureau</h3>

Only the government will set prices. A plan has now been drafted and it is planned to entrust the British firm Anliying Foreign Firm to handle it for a period of two years.

<h3>Japan Stops Submitting Anti-Boycott Treaty Proposal</h3>
<p>Japan will propose a new treaty at the World Economic Conference to prohibit boycotts to deal with the Sino-Japanese problem. This rumor has been circulating for quite some time. Today's foreign news reported that the Japanese government will order its representatives to suspend the proposal. The reasons given by the Japanese government for this change are: (1) Japan insists on the principle of directly resolving all political and economic issues between China and Japan and resolutely rejects interference from third countries. Therefore, Japan should resolve the issue of boycotting Japanese goods on its own. (2) Japan has many kinds of rights and interests in China. Merely resolving the issue of boycotting goods is not enough to ensure the safety of Japan's right of self-defense in China. From these two simple reasons, we can fully understand Japan's intentions and means towards China after the ceasefire in North China.</p>
<p>The Japanese government's unwillingness to submit the anti-boycott treaty proposal to the Economic Conference is, on the one hand, due to the fact that China's boycott of Japanese goods as a retaliatory measure against Japan's military aggression has been recognized by the world, and the recent vigorous promotion of boycotts against British India by Japanese merchants is actually contradictory to the proposal. However, we should not be misled by this. Japan's desire to force China to negotiate directly with it, and its desire to use military threats to resolve all so-called pending issues between China and Japan is the fundamental policy it has held since the September 18th Incident. The Chinese diplomatic authorities understand that this policy of Japan is extremely dangerous to China, so they seek solutions from the League of Nations as a means of response. The Chinese people understand where Japan's conspiracy lies, so they are terrified as soon as they hear the sound of direct negotiations. Now, at a time when the ceasefire in North China has just been successfully concluded, Japan has indicated, after many twists and turns, that it still wants to achieve its fundamental goal of monopolizing China. This is what we deeply fear and must urgently urge our authorities to pay attention to. Recently, Song Ziwen's speech at the World Economic Conference, outlining China's contribution to the world and rejecting the Monroe Doctrine of East Asia, is endorsed by us in the sense that it is a response to Japan's attempt to monopolize China. Although the Open Door Policy is not entirely beneficial to China, it can still avoid immediate division. What we want to know today is whether what Song said is the unanimous policy of our government. If so, how will our government respond to Japan's exposure of this intention?</p>
<p>The North China ceasefire agreement is, in the eyes of our country's authorities, completely unrelated to politics and diplomacy. In the eyes of the Japanese, it seems to be a stepping stone to carry out their political and diplomatic intentions. Their suspension of the anti-boycott treaty proposal is a matter of weighing the pros and cons and taking the greater advantage. Their "need to consider with a cautious attitude" is also to consider how the benefits of a change of direction will increase.</p>

<h3>Japan Changes Policy and Does Not Submit Anti-Boycott Proposal</h3>
<p>The principle of direct negotiations on the Sino-Japanese issue does not want to lead the tiger into the house and encourage interference from third parties.</p>

<h3>The Economic and Financial Committees Held Separate Meetings Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government, regarding whether to submit a proposal to the World Economic Conference to prohibit general anti-foreign goods movements, because of its greatest impact on Japanese politics and economy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after the departure of Plenipotentiary Ishii, still contacted the military to study this issue with a cautious attitude. Recently, it decided not to submit this proposal for the following reasons: The anti-foreign goods movement ban proposal is an abstract theoretical proposal that should be made into an international treaty, but this matter has various complicated situations in Japan. That is, Japan mainly considers the issue of anti-Japanese goods in China, but the relationship between China and Japan is very different from the relationship between foreign countries. Japan, limited to the issue of China, insists on the iron rule of directly resolving all political and economic issues between China and Japan, and resolutely rejects interference from third countries. Therefore, Japan should resolve the issue of anti-Japanese goods in China on its own. Moreover, Japan has many kinds of rights and interests in China. Merely resolving the issue of anti-Japanese goods is not enough to say that Japan's right of self-defense in China is safe. Therefore, Japan, in order to exercise its entire right of self-defense, must consider the issue with a cautious attitude. The government will instruct Plenipotentiary Ishii on this policy in the near future. (Nineteenth, Japan United Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government originally wanted to submit a treaty proposal to the London Economic Conference to prohibit boycotts. Representative Ishii had already sought assistance from Roosevelt in the United States. Recently, due to opposition from the military, it was abandoned. Uchida telegraphed Ishii to abandon the original proposal. The reasons for the military's opposition were: (1) Although the anti-boycott treaty proposal is an ordinary treaty, in fact, Japan's purpose is to stop China's boycott of Japanese goods, which would cause third countries to participate in the Sino-Japanese dispute. Japan will ultimately not be able to privately resolve all pending issues with China, which is unfavorable to Japan. (2) The Japanese government advocates the Monroe Doctrine of Asia. The new treaty violates the doctrine of leading the tiger into the house. (3) Compared with other countries, Japan has more rights and interests in China. If the new treaty is established, it will no longer be possible to use self-defense as an excuse to start military actions, which is detrimental to Japan. (4) In order to implement its national policy, Japan should maintain a broad right of self-defense in China in order to take necessary actions in response to the times.

<h3>Economic Committee Debates Commercial Policy</h3>
<p>French Representative Proposes Production and Sales Organization Plan (London) The Economic and Trade Committee opened its meeting at 11:03 this morning. Chairman Colin announced that Venezuela has now joined the tariff truce. There are now 49 countries adhering to the tariff truce, accounting for 85% of world trade. The committee then decided, on the chairman's recommendation, to spend a day and a half or two days specifically debating the various proposals submitted to the committee, including issues such as normalization of trade, tariff policy, subsidized production, sales business combinations, and public works. After the debate, the various suggestions will be handed over to the drafting committee for processing. The French Minister of Commerce, Serre, put forward an important French proposal, saying that the international reorganization of production and sales is a necessary condition for world recovery. The conference should study the possibility of governments concluding agreements on the production of certain items, such as wheat, wood, wine, cotton, wool, coal, silver, etc. He advocated using producer agreements to abolish the anarchism of production that is irrelevant to sales. Those who wish to discuss quotas first are like doctors who believe that eliminating minor illnesses can eliminate the root of the disease. Serre's proposal to immediately debate the proposal for a comprehensive calculation of production has aroused some discussion. Some representatives claimed that they still need to study the French proposal at their leisure. The French representative temporarily withdrew his proposal and the conference began to discuss the first item on the agenda, namely commercial policy. Speakers included Italy, Spain, Greece, and Poland. The Italian representative said that any form of currency stabilization must focus on gold, which is the key to world economic recovery. The other three representatives all spoke about the need to abolish import restrictions and prohibitions. The Polish representative proposed that there should be bilateral agreements to eliminate import bans to the greatest possible extent, and that a conference should be convened in two years to study the possibility of completely removing such restrictions. The Belgian representative, Hyman, said that these restrictions should be gradually eliminated, and should be carried out in parallel with the work in the monetary field. All countries participating in this meeting should help to form international agreements with this as the goal. The Economic Committee adjourned at 1:15 pm and will continue the discussion on commercial policy at 3:00 pm. The conference hopes that after the afternoon discussion, this matter can be submitted to the drafting committee in order to draft specific proposals. (Nineteenth, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Continued Meeting in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Litvinov Resumes Old Habits, Sets Up Subcommittee with German as Chairman (London) When the Economic Committee continued its meeting this afternoon, Russian representative Litvinov and the chairman debated with each other. Litvinov had previously made critical remarks against other countries at the plenary meeting of the conference. Today, he resumed his old habits, saying that the United States and Belgium have now suggested extending the tariff truce. Then the proposal to abolish oppressive plans previously advocated by the Soviet Union should also be discussed at the same time. After the Russian representative and the chairman debated with each other, the chairman finally decided that when discussing the issues of tariffs and treaty policy, Litvinov would have the opportunity to explain the events he proposed. British representative Runciman stated the British view, saying that in a broad sense, he expressed sympathy for the proposal made by the French representative this morning, but multilateral agreements on production, if not effectively implemented by the governments concerned, would not be effective. We must not allow multilateral agreements to be detrimental to countries with low tax rates. In the British view, bilateral agreements are more effective than multilateral ones. The United Kingdom has already done a little bit of this and is now preparing to expand it. The United Kingdom is not prepared to sacrifice its bilateral agreements for the unconditional observance of the most-favored-nation clause principle, but the United Kingdom is prepared to adjust production plans, provided that the majority of producers support it and the interests of consumers in importing countries are guaranteed. After the British Minister of Commerce spoke, the Economic Committee decided to establish a subcommittee, with German representative Krogman as chairman, to consider commercial policy issues. Later, it discussed the issue of coordinating production and sales and adjourned at 5:00 pm until 11:00 am tomorrow. (Nineteenth, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Financial Committee Discusses Conference Procedures</h3>
<p>Six Small Countries Propose Suggestions to Handle Debt Issues, Two Small Committees Established with Austrian and Italian Representatives as Chairmen (London) When the Monetary and Financial Committee met at 11:20 this morning, disputes arose between small and large countries. Small countries wanted to spend more time discussing in detail, while large countries wanted to establish any method that could save time. First, the Romanian representative, in the name of Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, proposed suggestions to the Monetary Committee to handle the complex issues arising from long-term and short-term debts, saying that the first subcommittee of the Monetary Committee should consider the following five points: (1) The monetary policies that various countries that have adopted exchange restrictions should adopt as a prerequisite for restoring the gold standard. (2) Plans to enable debtor countries to fulfill their debts. (3) Direct negotiations between creditor and debtor countries to reorganize debts when necessary. (4) Considering ways to restore international credit business, especially focusing on the needs of agricultural countries. (5) Considering ways to restore capital flow. The Romanian representative also suggested that the second subcommittee should consider the relationship between the work of the central banks of agricultural countries and the work of the gold standard, especially focusing on the needs of flexibility arising from agricultural situations. The Monetary Committee decided to invite the Financial Committee and the President of the International Clearing Bank to handle this matter together. At this point, the proposals of Romania and others were handed over to the two subcommittees established by the Monetary Committee for research. The chairman of the Monetary Committee, American Cox, proposed to appoint the vice-chairman, Austrian Schumpeter, and Italian Reng as chairmen of the two subcommittees. This proposal was passed by the public. The Indian representative asked whether the substitutes of the representatives could serve in this position. The chairmen of the two subcommittees replied that they could. It is estimated that the first subcommittee will handle emergency measures to solve monetary problems, while the second subcommittee will handle permanent plans. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain said that the work of these two subcommittees would conflict. The chairman then asked him to put forward specific solutions. Chamberlain advocated that one should meet in the morning and the other should meet in the afternoon. Vice-chairman Reng said that the chairman of the conference, MacDonald, had expressed the hope that the conference would be concluded as soon as possible, so he advocated not wasting time. Cox agreed with this. In the general discussion, several European representatives wanted to have a general discussion on all aspects of monetary issues, while the representatives of large countries advocated that the Monetary Committee should not adopt any procedures that could delay the time. French representative Bonnet suggested that the two subcommittees could meet at the same time in the first few days in order to speed up the progress of the conference. If it is feasible in the future, they can meet at different times. Finally, it was decided that both subcommittees must meet at 4:00 pm today. The Monetary Committee adjourned at 12:30 pm and will reconvene after the Secretariat calls it. (Nineteenth, Reuters)</p>

<h3>The US and France Form Confrontation on the Issue of Stabilizing Currencies</h3>
<p>The US Adopts a Firm Stance Against Temporary Agreements, France is Greatly Disappointed, Saying it is Like Building a Pagoda on the Sand (London) The work of the main issues of the World Economic Conference may be suspended due to the current stalemate in currency stability. The French side is very disappointed that the US President did not accept the stability proposal. A French observer told people today that it is impossible to place a permanent economic structure on unstable currencies, which is like building a pagoda on the sand. People here interpret this statement as implying that the French side feels that it is useless to discuss tariffs, etc. until the currency stability issue is resolved. However, everyone believes that the conference will proceed with other work to avoid appearing to be suspended. (Eighteenth, Reuters)</p>
<p>(New York) Newspaper special correspondents stationed in Washington telegraphed today that the United States is now taking a strong stance against any temporary or permanent currency measures, as such measures would again give foreign countries economic benefits from tight currencies. The currency proposal opposed by the US President was drafted by Professor Spraley, who was recently appointed as an advisor to the US Treasury Department, and apparently represents the views of the majority of representatives attending the World Economic Conference in addition to the US delegation. The original intention of this proposal was only to stipulate ways to control currency fluctuations while permanent stability negotiations were underway. (Eighteenth, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Policy Runs Counter to Hull's</h3>
<p>(New York) The diplomatic community points to this attitude of the United States as evidence that President Roosevelt's domestic recovery program is not integrated with Secretary of State Hull's international cooperation policy. The new instructions sent by the US government to the US delegation in London do not contain any counter-proposals. US President Advisor Moray said today that he is convinced that the Economic Conference will not collapse due to the currency stalemate. Wall Street believes that the US dollar will definitely not stubbornly adhere to the fixed price mentioned outside. (Eighteenth, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Currency Inflation is Underway in Washington</h3>
<p>(Washington) US authorities today talked about the news that the World Economic Conference is expected to reach an agreement on currency measures within a week, saying that the US government is willing to agree to it at an appropriate time. President Roosevelt is afraid that a sudden stability measure at this time will prevent the recent rise in US prices, and is now eager to continue its currency inflation process before the US dollar price is determined. (Nineteenth, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Let the Currency Rise and Fall on Its Own</h3>
<p>(Washington) Currency experts here and financial leaders in other cities in the United States are now also deeply doubtful about the attitude of the White House towards stabilizing international exchange rates. The President, who was sailing at sea, sailed into Edgartown Bay, Massachusetts to avoid storms, but since leaving Beijing, he has not expressed any opinion on the European proposal to stabilize exchange rates during the conference. Only the Treasury Department indirectly stated that the President opposed this move. It is heard that after the President left Beijing, the developments in London are still reported to the President by radio at any time. It is expected that there will be instructions to the US delegation, but the officialdom has no expression on the content of this. Therefore, the general impression in the US capital is that the President wants to temporarily allow the currency to rise and fall on its own without adding manpower until a permanent stability plan is negotiated at the London Conference. According to the announcement when the US delegation departed, it was going with three major goals, namely reducing tariffs, raising prices, and stabilizing exchange rates. After arriving in London, there was no plan to stabilize exchange rates. So far, only European proposals have been forwarded to the country. Therefore, more and more people in the US capital believe that the President has a temporary laissez-faire attitude. (Eighteenth, National Telegram)</p>

<h3>French Newspapers Criticize US Diplomatic Habits</h3>
<p>(Paris) News from Washington that President Roosevelt has rejected the temporary currency stabilization agreement set by the Economic Committee has aroused criticism from French newspapers today.

<h3>Concerns of the Japanese Financial Community</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese exchange banks and Yokohama Specie Bank, regarding the intention of the US-Japan exchange agreement of the United States, said that Japan's exchange reserve of 25 US dollars is only reluctantly maintained by unilateral exchange, and is not based on the improvement of Japanese trade, the elimination of deficit government bonds, and the reduction of currency inflation. The reason for Japan's gold stabilization has nothing to rely on, and it is unreasonable to stabilize the exchange rate against the United States at 26 or 27 US dollars, and the result is not a problem. Moreover, it is possible to maintain an agreement that has obtained a certain degree of stability in countries that hold a lot of gold, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, but it is impossible in Japan. In short, this issue is a problem after the restoration of the gold standard, so they expressed their opposition from the beginning. On the one hand, the exchange industry is also of the opinion that stabilization is impossible because it involves principles, such as the current situation in Japan without an exchange stabilization mechanism. Moreover, when the exchange agreement between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France is still difficult to establish, it is unreasonable to decide the US-Japan exchange rate.

<h3>German Representative Hugenberg Will Still Return to London</h3>
<p>Demanding the Return of Old Colonies, German People Claim that the Memorandum Has Not Been Withdrawn, Russian Newspaper Warns Germany Not to Cherish Ambitions (Berlin) German Minister of Economics, Hugenberg, the representative attending the London World Economic Conference, arrived here from London today, but will return to England again at the end of this week to continue the discussion of the Economic Conference. Hugenberg will contact all parties in the next few days, and tomorrow will be his 68th birthday. (Eighteenth, National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) German Minister of Economics, Hugenberg, the representative to the German Economic Conference, submitted a memorandum a few days ago, demanding the recovery of German African colonies. After this telegram was issued, those close to the National Socialist Party believed that the current position was very difficult. The National Socialist Party intends to take the opportunity to reduce the status of the National People's Party in the government, but according to another statement, Hugenberg will be fully trusted by Hitler and will attend the Economic Conference again. It is also said that Hugenberg is expected to return to London on Friday. The Germans unanimously argued that the memorandum was not withdrawn, but only the German delegation declared to Colin, the chairman of the Economic Committee, that the nature of this memorandum was the personal suggestion of the German Minister of Economics, Hugenberg. (Nineteenth, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Truth Daily published an article warning Germany not to interfere with Russia and Turkey, otherwise the Soviet Union will take severe revenge. The article commented on the astonishing proposal made by the German representative, Hugenberg, to the World Economic Conference, advocating the use of Eastern Europe, Russia, and Turkey as the tail of German colonies, saying that this proposal openly reveals the fundamental point of the diplomatic policy of Fascist speculators, and is no different from the various similar documents published by the official representatives of Germany today. The German delegation then made excuses, attributing the responsibility solely to Hugenberg, and their words are worthless. German fascists are now trying to find a way out of the emergency situation in their imperialist expansion in the East. (Nineteenth, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Beetman Denies the US Tax Cut Proposal</h3>
<p>(London) The US representative attending the London Economic Conference absolutely denied the proposal to reduce tariffs by one-tenth today, saying that the specialist advisors of the US delegation allowed this idea to be the basis for the establishment of the conference for discussion. The Economic Committee of the conference, not the US delegation, made this proposal. The US tax cut proposal was only known today to be of an informal nature, and the conference was quite surprised by this, but not worried, because some people have criticized this proposal as impracticable. Or a tax cut of one-tenth will not affect those who levy a value-added tax of one-fourth, and those who levy a value-added tax of one-tenth will be reduced too much, which is very unequal. (Eighteenth, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) All European countries are angry at the US government's refusal to endorse the proposal to reduce tariffs by one-tenth, which is mostly due to misunderstanding, because the representatives still maintain their own political connections. At the same time, although the proposal to reduce tariffs by one-tenth is not included in the official US proposal, it is still before the conference. (Nineteenth, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japan Opposes Reducing Tariffs</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has expressed its opposition to the US representative's proposal to reduce tariffs uniformly by 10%. The reasons for its opposition are: (1) The world's major countries have increased their tariffs after the European War. The Japanese government has made several small modifications since the enactment of the law in the 42nd year of Meiji, but the entire tariff law has not been changed to date, so its tax rate is lighter. (2) If this case is not deliberated in the form of a universal treaty, but a reciprocal agreement is signed between the two countries with closer interests, and the third country shares its benefits with the most-favored-nation clause, then the Japanese government can also agree. (3) If Japan is allowed to increase its tariffs to the same level as other countries, and then reduce it by 10%, the Japanese government may agree to this method, otherwise it cannot participate in the new agreement. (4) The purpose of the US proposal is to extend the tariff truce, and there is no objection in principle, but if the participating countries want to attach reservations and can levy anti-dumping taxes, then the effect of the new treaty is equal to waste paper, and no benefits can be obtained even if they participate. (5) If the general trend of the conference cannot accept Japan's claims and adopt the agreements of other countries, and adopt a universal treaty, Japan must convene the Diet or modify the tariff law by temporary imperial edict. This point must be studied jointly by the provinces. (Nineteenth, China United Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Prepares to Build High Tariff Walls</h3>
<h3>Continuously Discriminating Against Japanese Goods in Malaya, Negotiations Between Indian and Japanese Merchants are Accelerating (Tokyo)</h3>
<p>Regarding the tariff issue, the Japanese Foreign Ministry, due to Japan's unfavorable tariff position, has the following proposed measures: (1) Implement an emergency imperial ordinance to increase retaliatory tariffs; (2) Promulgate an emergency imperial ordinance to implement double tariffs based on the restoration tax system. It has been decided to urge the Ministry of Finance to consider these measures. Some argue that such tax increases violate the tariff truce resolution, but the government's view is that it only participated with reservations, so it does not violate the resolution.

<h3>(Tokyo)</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Consul General Tamura in Singapore, the British Malayan Federation has revised tariffs on woven goods of hemp, rayon, and cotton silk from the 15th. The tariffs have been revised as follows: Tariffs on foreign goods will increase by 20% ad valorem or 5 cents per yard, while tariffs on British goods will increase by 10% ad valorem or 2.5 cents per yard, all imposing high taxes. This tax increase echoes India's tax increase, and its target is Japanese goods. Therefore, Japanese goods will have to shift to mid- and low-grade products in the future.

<h3>(Tokyo)</h3>
<p>The Japanese Foreign Ministry wants to urgently resolve the trade issue with the Indian government. If the resolution is delayed, many difficulties will arise. It is said that the Foreign Ministry is anxious for many reasons. The important reasons are briefly listed as follows: (1) The second half of the year is the export period for Japanese trade. If this opportunity is missed, serious problems will occur in the domestic economic and labor sectors; (2) If anti-British measures are intensified, it will bring Britain and China closer together. Japan will not only lose out to Britain but also hinder future negotiations with China; (3) As a result of boycotting Indian cotton, the number of unemployed people in the country will increase, and the losses suffered by shipping companies, transporters, and traders will be countless. Given the above reasons, the Japanese government has telegraphed Consul General Miyake to expedite preliminary negotiations. Japanese representatives and trade delegation representatives have also been nominated. (19th, China United Press)</p>
<h3>(Tokyo)</h3>
<p>It has been reported that as a result of Commercial Member of the Indian Viceroy's Cabinet, Bauer, hearing Consul of Ximola's assurance that India is ready to conclude a new commercial treaty with Japan, the official India-Japan trade conference is expected to be held soon. On June 17, the Japanese Consul asked Bauer whether the Indian government was prepared to conclude a new commercial treaty with Japan, or to reinstate the old treaty that was about to expire. If neither of these was intended, would it consider concluding an agreement with Japan regarding commerce, transportation, and shipping? The official agreed to open new treaty negotiations in his reply and promised to give a formal reply. This document is expected to arrive in Tokyo this afternoon. After receiving this document, the Japanese government will appoint Sawada, former Secretary-General of the Japanese delegation to the League of Nations, as the representative to the India-Japan trade conference, and plans to have many experts accompany him.

<h3>Japan Expands Radio to Resist Nanjing's Large Radio Station</h3>
<p>According to the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun on June 13, since the Nanjing Broadcasting Radio Station has been broadcasting to Japan, its powerful electricity has often affected the Japanese radio network, especially in the Kyushu region, which is close to Nanjing. The Ministry of Communications has decided to install broadcasting equipment with 100 kilowatts stronger electricity than the Nanjing radio in Fukuoka. After investigation by the Engineering Bureau and the Broadcasting Association, in addition to Fukuoka, the Tokyo and Osaka Broadcasting Stations will also be remodeled with powerful electricity above 75 kilowatts in order to confront Nanjing and other neighboring countries. On the one hand, after the Fukuoka, Tokyo, and Osaka three major broadcasting station projects are implemented, the Broadcasting Association will set up another 16 small broadcasting stations. The total amount of this powerful electricity plan is estimated at more than 15 million yuan. According to the Director of the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, the major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka are currently using weak electricity of 10 kilowatts. Therefore, they are often hindered by the powerful electricity of China and Russia, so they have to expand the equipment to resist them.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Provincial County Magistrate Conference</h3>
<h3>All Administrative Commissioners and County Magistrates Attend to Discuss Promoting Policies for Clearing Bandits and Post-Disaster Relief.</h3>
<p>(Nanchang Communication) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Chairman Xiong Shihui believe that with the five provinces launching a major campaign to suppress bandits, Jiangxi is the military center. Counties not affected by banditry must vigorously implement rural cleansing to prevent the spread of poisonous bacteria, organize the full mobilization of the masses, and help the army advance to suppress them. This is absolutely related to military victory. Within the reach of military force, saving the dying and healing the wounded, gathering refugees, and restoring order are all fundamental key points of rural cleansing. The above items are all taken care of by the county government, which is the only implementing agency. Therefore, a county magistrate conference was specially convened to develop an effective implementation plan for clearing bandits and post-disaster relief, so as to assist in areas beyond the reach of military forces. After reviewing the 82 counties in the province (including the newly established Yipingchi County), divided into 13 administrative districts, except for the counties of Yudu, Xingguo, Ningdu, Guangchang, Shicheng, Ruijin, etc., which were all occupied by bandits, and because southern Jiangxi counties are remote and blocked by bandits, they could not come to participate. Those who have reported include the county magistrates of Yichun, Ji'an, Yushan, Wuning, and other 45 counties. Administrative supervisors who have reported include Zhang Chi of the 11th and 13th districts (Ganzhou), Guo Su of the 6th district (Shangrao), Zhou Zuofu of the 7th district (Fuzhou), Ge Guangjiu of the 5th district (Raozhou), Wang Youlan of the 9th and 10th districts (Western Jiangxi), and Liao Shiqiao of the Northern Jiangxi district. Prior to the conference, the provincial government established a secretariat for the county magistrate conference, appointing Wang Youyong, secretary of the Civil Affairs Department, as the secretary-general. More than 100 reports and proposals were received, reviewed by four administrative commissioners, categorized, and included in the agenda. The cases are generally divided into (1) strengthening the Baojia system to help the army, (2) clearing the countryside and defending oneself to consolidate the rear, (3) vigorously implementing post-disaster relief to save the bandit-stricken, (4) restoring order and prospering the countryside (5) using political power to assist the army in clarifying the source of bandits, (6) matters that should be promoted or reformed in county administration. The meeting place was located in the auditorium of the Provincial Party Headquarters. At 8:00 AM on the 16th, the opening ceremony was held. Due to military engagements, Chiang Kai-shek was represented by Secretary-General Yang Yongtai. After the music was played and the meeting was opened, Chairman Xiong Shihui performed the ceremony and delivered the opening speech. Secretary-General Yang and Director Zhu of the Department of Civil Affairs then delivered instructions successively, roughly to encourage the county magistrates to work hard to clear bandits and clarify the source of bandits. At 10:10, the ceremony was completed, and the county magistrates of Pingxiang and Xinyu reported. The meeting adjourned at 11:00. After the members lunched in the West Flower Hall of the Provincial Government, it resumed at 2:00 PM. The county magistrates of Leping, Yiyang, Jinxi, and Chongren reported on the situation of the Red bandits in their counties, the conditions of the disaster areas, the organization and training of the Baojia teams, the construction of forts and roads, the prevention of suppression and rural cleansing, construction, education, and finance. Then the county magistrates of Nanfeng, Jishui, and Yongxin reported. At that time, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek called Xiong Shihui to the military headquarters to discuss military affairs, and Zhu Huaibing, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, took over as chairman. In order to save time, the chairman designated one county each from eastern Jiangxi, western Jiangxi, southern Jiangxi, and northern Jiangxi in the bandit area, semi-bandit area, and non-bandit area to report. After the reports from each county were completed, Zhu Huaibing made a brief comment and conclusion on each report, and stated that these were derived from practical experience and that the particularly effective ones would be promulgated and implemented. The duration of the conference is tentatively set at three days to allow the county magistrates to return to their counties to work. (June 16)</p>

<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister Visits Germany</h3>
<h3>Close Relations Between the Two Countries National 18th, Erfurth, Germany Telegram</h3>
<p>Today, German Chancellor Hitler, accompanied by Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös, Interior Minister Frick, and many important leaders of the National Socialist Party, as well as Prussian Prince August Wilhelm, came here to inspect the Stormtroopers, about 60,000 people. Hitler also gave a speech at the City Hall, saying that this visit to Erfurth was his first official visit to any place since taking office as Chancellor. In the afternoon, Mr. Xi held a banquet to entertain the Hungarian Prime Minister, after which the Hungarian Prime Minister returned to Budapest on Mr. Xi's specially prepared plane. After the Hungarian Prime Minister left Germany, the Foreign Political Group of the National Socialist Party announced a message, which stated, "On Saturday, Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös visited Mr. Hitler's residence. The matters discussed between the two sides were general economic and political issues. The relationship of this meeting between the leaders of the two countries is extremely important, and the results have been completely successful."</p>
<h3>Havas 18th Berlin Telegram</h3>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Bureau of the National Socialist Party issued a statement, which stated, "At the end of May this year, Germany sent a delegation to Hungary to quickly resolve the business relations between Germany and Hungary on a new foundation. The visit of Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös to Berlin was arranged in advance by the German delegation. The contact between Germany and Hungary lies in eliminating economic chaos, and the various issues of reorganizing southeastern Europe are launched from this. This economic offensive has a significant impact on politics. This can be seen from the fact that the Hungarian Prime Minister traveled to Germany. When Gömbös talked with the German authorities, he naturally involved the internal affairs of Austria. The reason why Hungary and Germany resolved their relationship is also the reason for the compromise between Hungary and Romania. The compromise between Hungary and Romania can be expected to have other favorable developments. Now the National Socialist Party offices in Berlin and Vienna are working hard to find a new organization for the most chaotic and difficult part of Central Europe, so that all parties can be satisfied."</p>

There must be many friends in the world who will help them.</p>
<h3>Brazilian Engineer Invents Death Ray</h3>
<h3>Able to Cause Explosives to Detonate Reuters St. Paul, Brazil Communication</h3>
<p>According to Brazilian engineer Dr. Pintu, he has invented a death ray. This ray is emitted from electrical equipment and can ignite flammable materials and cause explosives to detonate. In January this year, the French mail ship "Atlantic" caught fire and was destroyed, and the causes of other major fires in previous mail ships have never been found. According to Dr. Pintu, they were all caused by this kind of death ray that no one knows about. Dr. Pintu is deeply afraid that ignorant people will abuse this ray and endanger society, so he refuses to make what he knows public, but he has notified the Brazilian Machinery Club of the details, and on the one hand, he continues to study diligently.</p>

<p>A fleet of 24 Italian airships plans to fly across the Atlantic to reach the Chicago Century of Progress Exposition. The route is planned to have five stops: Amsterdam, Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, and Canada. Now, due to wind and snow in the far north, the departure date has been postponed today. According to Aviation Minister Balbo, the commander of the fleet, the supply ship "Elas" carrying food and other supplies to Labrador Peninsula east of Canada cannot pass the Strait of Belle Isle because there is ice in the ocean.

<h3>Result of the Third German Parliamentary Re-election (Berlin Dispatch) (Public Security)</h3>
<p>The Mystery of the Reichstag Fire</p>
<p>The Course of the Reichstag Fire: The German Reichstag was unfortunately struck by a fire at 9:30 PM on February 27th of this year. Although the Berlin Fire Brigade bravely attempted to contain the blaze, it was difficult to extinguish due to the fierce eruption of the flames. It was not until 11:30 PM that the fire was brought under control. By then, the great Reichstag building had been largely reduced to scorched ruins, with losses estimated at millions of marks.</p>
<p>This Reichstag fire was truly bizarre. Since its occurrence, it has caused tremendous shock, disturbance, and panic, not only in Berlin and throughout Germany, but also drawn significant attention in European and American public opinion. In world history, the burning of a parliament is indeed a rare event. The cause of this fire was not due to carelessness. Investigations suggest it was an act by German communists, a planned revolt against the existing right-leaning cabinet government of the Hitler Fascist party. The Berlin Police Department arrested a suspect at the scene, a Dutch young communist named Munchen. After his arrest, he confessed to the arson, stating that his motive was to avenge international capitalism, and so on. Simultaneously, news circulated from other social circles that the Reichstag fire was a conspiracy and riot orchestrated by the German Communist Party and the Left Wing Front (i.e., the German Social Democratic Party) to disrupt the current social system, seize power, and accomplish their riotous plans. It was not just the Reichstag that was targeted; in fact, government agencies throughout Germany and water, electricity, and gas plants in major cities were all being targeted for destruction. After this sinister and serious rumor spread, the citizens of Berlin were the first to bear the brunt, filled with panic. Society was plunged into a red terror. In all the cities, people were terrified, and the entire country was filled with revolutionary tension. At the time, I was residing in Munich for business and witnessed the extremely dangerous political atmosphere. Even before the Reichstag fire, the local government in Munich was dissatisfied with the political actions of the Hitler cabinet in Berlin, and there were repeated movements to restore the monarchy, which had already caused concern. Adding to this the panic of a communist riot, the turmoil was indescribable. Having lived in Germany for many years, I had never experienced such political life or such severe social turmoil and seriousness as that caused by the Reichstag fire.</p>
<p>In order to stabilize public sentiment and prevent unforeseen circumstances, the German government, the day after the Reichstag fire (i.e., February 29th), immediately issued an emergency decree based on Article 48, Section 4 of the Federal Constitution (this article of the constitution stipulates that in the event of a very serious incident that endangers the life of the nation and its people, the German President has the power to issue an emergency decree, also known as an exceptional law, and may apply all the greatest possible powers of the government to ensure the safety of the nation and society). Martial law was declared in Berlin, and rigorous measures were taken to prevent upheaval. All Communist and Democratic Party institutions in Berlin were searched and closed. Thousands of key members of the Communist and Social Democratic parties across the country were arrested, most of whom were journalists, university professors, university students, doctors, lawyers, writers, novelists, and some foreign communists. Simultaneously, all political institutions nationwide, from the capital to the villages, were reorganized. Government officials even slightly suspected of left-leaning tendencies were dismissed and arrested, or forcibly taken over. In terms of public opinion, all Communist and Social Democratic newspapers were shut down, and strict censorship of the press was enforced, so there was no possibility for the public to criticize the incident. Therefore, it was difficult for outsiders to understand the right and wrong of the matter. The cabinet government's handling of the incident was called conducting a national revolution and eliminating the communist scourge. In reality, the situation was no different from the Chinese Kuomintang's purge of the Communists. Therefore, we can say that the German coup was essentially a German fascist purge, which is accurate and to the point.</p>
<h3>The Political Background of the Reichstag Fire</h3>
<p>The German government has declared that the Reichstag fire was a riotous conspiracy by the leftist Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party to oppose the government. However, whether this accusation and judgment are accurate and correct remains questionable in public opinion. The press in England, France, Switzerland, and America often question this conclusion. This shows the strange nature of the case. The leftists vehemently deny it and are eager to explain, but the government has already absolutely and strictly deprived them of their right to speak. Therefore, the public and foreign observers are unable to hear the left's defense, and the issue of the Reichstag fire has become a major political mystery. Many foreign media outlets suspect that the case is a political counter-propaganda tactic by the right-wing cabinet government. With parliamentary re-elections imminent (March 5th), the leftist faction would reasonably adopt smooth tactics and peaceful policies to win the favor of voters and increase their votes. They would not resort to murder and arson before the election, creating panic and negative impressions in society, which would make victory impossible. This behavior would be tantamount to political suicide. If the leftist faction had even a little political common sense, they would not have resorted to such a poor tactic. On the other hand, the right-wing Hitler Fascist government, with parliamentary re-elections approaching, could use counter-propaganda to fundamentally defeat the leftist election groups and their influence. They could use their own spear to pierce their own shield, sacrificing greatly by setting fire to the Reichstag and blaming the left. This would make the people hate and despise the leftist Communists and Social Democrats for their violent and terrifying behavior. The people would become alienated from them, and their voting power would naturally be reduced during the election. The government could use this arson accusation to severely prohibit all speeches and political actions of the Communist and Social Democratic parties, arrest their leaders, and dissolve their party organizations. Thus, the power of the leftist front would be declared bankrupt and disintegrated in the invisible, and the election would naturally be impossible for them. In the end, only the Fascist right-wing would be left to manipulate the election, achieving their final electoral victory. This kind of conjecture is more reasonable. In short, regardless of who the perpetrator is, the Reichstag fire is a major political mystery in Germany, worthy of careful consideration.</p>
<h3>The Reichstag Fire and Its Impact on the Third Parliamentary Re-election</h3>
<p>After the Reichstag was burned on the evening of February 27th, for several days on February 28th and March 1st and 2nd, the social and political situation in Germany was indeed in a state of extreme danger. Martial law was declared throughout the country. The Berlin police defense force was insufficient and was immediately reinforced by a large number of steel-helmeted troops to assist the police in maintaining order. Although society had slightly returned to normal by the time of the third parliamentary election on March 5th, people were still jittery, fearing nonexistent dangers. On that day, the election campaigns of the leftist Communist and Social Democratic parties were strictly prohibited, and their banners were already furled. The leftist front was not only forbidden to distribute election leaflets, but they were also not even allowed to shout a slogan. Therefore, the left can be said to have completely lost the autonomy of national political activity. On the contrary, the ruling Fascists (i.e., the National Socialist Workers' Party) were colorful, loud, triumphant, and, under the pretext of the Communist Party setting fire to the Reichstag, were able to launch a massive attack and propaganda against the illegal behavior of the Communist Party. Hitler even used the power of the government, using national radio broadcasts to deliver a lengthy election speech to the nation. The language was poignant and moving, inspiring the nation to unanimously oppose communism, reject class struggle, and support the overall national interests. The nation was moved by the pathetic speech. On the other hand, they were horrified by the communist riot. As a result, when participating in the election, they will undoubtedly be absorbed by the Fascist tune. Under such favorable election conditions, the Fascist right-wing was in, people with knowledge had already predicted that it would achieve good results. Therefore, the Reichstag fire was a harbinger of the Fascist election victory (to be continued).</p>
<h3>Expansion of the Sichuan War</h3>
<p>Hope for Peace in Western Sichuan Dashed, War Clouds Looming in Eastern Sichuan (Chongqing Dispatch): The Sichuan War has been re-ignited for over forty days. Although the central government has repeatedly issued orders to stop it and various parties have made numerous peace appeals, the 24th and 28th Armies have not ceased their military actions and continue to confront each other along the Bi River line. The battle lines have seen little progress. While the war in western Sichuan has not yet ended, the war in eastern Sichuan has also erupted. The 21st and 4th Armies have formally opened fire, expanding the scope of the war. All of Sichuan is increasingly mired in chaos and is beyond recovery. I will record the details below.</p>
<h3>Liu Wenhui Lacks Sincerity for a Ceasefire</h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui, commander of the 24th Army and the main protagonist of the Sichuan War in western Sichuan, has been vigorously promoting peace recently. In addition to issuing ceasefire telegrams and ordering the cessation of attacks by all units on the front lines, he has also revoked all temporary titles such as commander-in-chief and commander, indicating his intention to implement a ceasefire. He has also stated that he will not retaliate unless the main force of Deng Xihou's 28th Army attacks, and that he will ignore minor provocations, only defending the Bi River to block the 28th Army's counterattacks. In reality, this is one of Liu Wenhui's tactics. His intention is to use peace as an excuse to cut off reinforcements to the 28th Army and divert the target of attacks. In fact, the 24th Army has not stopped attacking the 28th Army, so the Bi River war has been slow and urgent, but there has been no fierce battle. The Chengdu Peace Conference elected Liu Zhaoqian (the current commander of the 1st Division of the 23rd Army) to visit Liu Wenhui to inquire about his true attitude and to earnestly state that the future of the Sichuan situation is extremely worrying, the gist being, "The remnants of the Red bandits in northern Sichuan are rekindling. Tongnan has fallen again, and the crisis is pressing. In eastern and southern Sichuan, bandits are rising like bees, emerging and disappearing unpredictably and difficult to suppress. At this time, even if the armies cooperate to stabilize the Sichuan situation, it is still not enough. How can we start a civil war and kill each other? Once disaster strikes, it will be overwhelming. Moreover, at a time when people's livelihoods are declining, everyone hates war. The central government and all parties are hoping to stop the war. If war is reignited, it will be difficult to explain to people. Furthermore, Jin Kang and you were classmates when you were young and have been comrades-in-arms for many years. Our personal relationship is not thin. We have shared hardships together. What cannot be understood between us? In this war, Jin Kang is certainly to blame for not managing his subordinates strictly. However, since the start of the war, the army's defense zone has been reduced by two-thirds. Currently, they are only in Xindu, Jintang, Guanghan, Xinfan, Pengxian, and other places. It is a problem for them to survive. The army's supplies cannot be maintained. Their request to return to their defense zone is also out of necessity. Please consider the future of the Sichuan situation and accommodate Deng's request to return to his defense zone. Other conditions can be discussed at length. It is nothing more than allowing the two armies to reach a solution based on the principle of equal happiness and hardship. Public and private relationships can be taken care of from now on," etc. Liu Wenhui indicated that he had no preconceived ideas. However, regarding the return of the 28th Army to its defense zone, he indicated that it could not be done at present. His attitude has softened compared to before because of the problem of the 21st Army sending troops to eastern Sichuan. Therefore, Liu Wenhui has concentrated the main forces in western Sichuan in southern Sichuan and the eastern route and has reappointed three commanders: Chen Hongwen, with 15 regiments, in the Ziyang and Jianyang area; Zhang Qingping, with 20 regiments, between Ren-shou and Jingyan; and Leng Ludong, with 15 regiments, in the Bi River area of western Sichuan, with the first and second routes moving to meet the 21st Army and the third route resisting the 28th Army. Liu Wenhui has also established a garrison command in Chengdu to prepare for a major battle.</p>
<h3>Deng Xihou Plots to Expand the War</h3>
<p>Deng Xihou of the 28th Army holds a great grudge against the 24th Army in this war and has stated that it must be fundamentally eliminated. When Liu Wenhui raised troops to attack, Deng was determined, so he humbled himself and ran to the 21st Army to beg for Liu Xiang's assistance. He also tried his best to win over Li Qixiang and Luo Zezhou to expand the Sichuan War and organize an anti-Liu group to overthrow the 24th Army. Therefore, the Chengdu Peace Conference has repeatedly asked Deng for a peace plan. Deng initially had no concrete plans. In the end, Deng proposed the condition that Liu Wenhui must completely cede the invaded defense zone and the province's tax revenue before there would be room for peace. On the 14th, Deng convened a meeting of all the army's generals in Hanzhou and decided that reconciliation would not be allowed until the pre-war situation was restored. The principle of equal happiness and hardship proposed by the various individuals, with both sides going to extremes, the distance of opinions is too far, and it is difficult to approach. If you want to achieve peace, you must take a compromise approach and make concessions to each other. It is advocated that the 28th Army give up one or two counties of defense zone, while the 24th Army will give up all of Jianyang to the 28th Army, thinking that it can slightly calm the anger of both sides. However, Deng still shows no sign of concession and has never agreed with the mediation principle of the mediators. Moreover, he failed to send a plenipotentiary representative, causing the mediators to be helpless. In recent days, Deng has also jointly sent a telegram to Liu Xiang of the 21st Army with the generals of the army, asking him to immediately send troops to quell the chaos, and the army is willing to obey orders and lead the way. Liu Xiang has agreed to his request and is preparing to send troops.</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang Sends Troops to Aid Deng and Attack Liu</h3>
<p>Liu Xiang of the 21st Army has recently been ordered by the central government to handle the Sichuan War with full authority and to restrain both sides. Moreover, Deng Xihou has telegraphed requesting that he immediately send troops. In addition, Li and Luo, who are under Liu Xiang, were Deng Xihou's old subordinates, and they are eager to try and strongly requested Liu to send troops as soon as possible. Under these circumstances, Liu Xiang convened all the generals to discuss the matter. The generals unanimously advocated war. Therefore, it was determined to concentrate 40 regiments of troops, with Wang Zhiyi as the commander of the front, Guo Xun as the deputy commander, and Wang Fangzhou as the commander-in-chief, and to attack the 24th Army in two routes. One route pressed toward Jianyang and Ziyang, and the other route pressed from Rongxian and Weiyuan toward Jiading and Jingyan. According to front-line dispatches, the first route of the 21st Army had already contacted the 24th Army in Beidouzhen (under the jurisdiction of Ziyang) on the 16th, and the fierce battle was quite intense. The scope of the Sichuan War has been expanded.</p>
<h3>Conflict Between Liu Xiang and Yang Sen</h3>
<p>Yang Sen, commander of the 20th Army stationed in northern Sichuan, recently planned to raise a large sum of money to enhance the combat power of the army and sent a special commissioner to Shanghai to order 500 new-style submachine guns, 500 hand-held machine guns, and 5,000 new-style rifles from foreign merchants, which He Chenjun was responsible for transporting into Sichuan. It was reported that when they arrived in Wanxian and Chongqing, they were detained by order of the 21st Army. When Yang Sen heard the news, he repeatedly telegraphed Liu Xiang requesting their return and sent representative Xiao Shomei to negotiate repeatedly, but to no avail, which made Yang Sen furious. He ordered the mobilization of 15 regiments to guard against provocations in the Liangshan, Dazhu, and Linshui areas of the 28th Army's defense zone. Under these circumstances, the war in eastern Sichuan is likely to follow the war in western Sichuan (June 17th).</p>
<h3>Disputes Between the Peiping Political Affairs Committee and the Press</h3>
<p>Refusal to allow reporters to attend meetings causes conflict: Yesterday (the 17th) was the date of the establishment of the Peiping Political Affairs Committee. Reporters from various newspapers and news agencies in the city and Tianjin gathered at the Diplomatic Building before 9:00 AM to gather news. The opening ceremony had no special ceremonies. The only thing that could be used as news material was the speech by Chairman Huang Fu, which was about 500 words long. Only one original manuscript was prepared. Each reporter who attended could only copy it separately, reading aloud and writing quickly. After much commotion, the full text of the speech was obtained. After the meeting, Chairman Huang and the committee members went downstairs to take pictures. After the event, it was about 11 o'clock. At this time, He Yingqin, who came to watch the ceremony, was in the east building. Huang and the committee members gathered around to talk. Huang gave his first speech to the staff. The reporters also followed to listen, but they were all rejected. A police officer led several police officers to the scene and ordered all reporters to leave. The reporters were very dissatisfied. Although they explained to the police officers, it was useless. They dispersed and returned. Soon, they met at a news agency to discuss countermeasures and decided on four measures, the general meaning being (1) the news of the establishment of the Political Affairs Committee must be published in the next day's newspaper at the very least. If there is no satisfactory result, all news about the Political Affairs Committee will be refused to be published, (2) The conditions for the resolution of this issue will be that a representative of the Political Affairs Committee offers an apology in writing, and that reporters should be given access to gather material in the future. (3) The reporters who attended the meeting shall jointly write to their newspaper and explain their decision. The resident reporters in Tianjin will handle the newspapers in Tianjin. (4) Before a response, all reporters will temporarily not gather any news from the Political Affairs Committee. For this reason, the evening newspapers in this area did not disclose any of the news from the establishment of the Political Affairs Committee. After the Committee learned of this information, they sent Secretary so-and-so twice to the Reporter Association to explain the misunderstanding, but there was no result. The reporters from each newspaper and news outlet from Peiping and Tianjin were very united about this incident in order to avoid unnecessary constraints in their future work. Also, for fear that a few newspapers will compromise with the Committee, they collectively decided that if anyone violates the decision to act alone, each newswire shall forever stop sending drafts as a warning, (June 18th).</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Plans Flood Control</h3>
<p>Director of the Department of Construction Inspects Embankments Along the River, and Plans Flood Prevention Measures (Anqing Dispatch): Recently, continuous rain has caused the waters of the Yangtze River to rise daily, with signs of a recurrence of the flood. Since the flood of two years ago, Anhui Province has not recovered from the devastation. People are deeply worried about suffering another disaster. Liu Yiyan, director of the Department of Construction, specially drafted urgent prevention measures, which were decided to be followed at the regular meeting of the provincial government on the 16th. At 10:00 AM today (the 17th), he, along with Qi Qun, director of the Water Conservancy Section of the department, Pei Yixiang, director of the Water Conservancy Engineering Office, Sun Peifang, magistrate of Huaining County, and many gentry, took the Anping chartered ship to inspect important dikes upstream and downstream along the river, urging and guiding protection nearby, and discussing flood prevention issues with the Jiangxi-Anhui Engineering Bureau. It is expected to return to the province on the 18th. The original text of the proposals and measures for strengthening flood control submitted by the department is recorded below,</p>
<h3>Proposal</h3>
<p>For the purpose of making a proposal, since the autumn of last year, the province has been actively carrying out flood and drought prevention, starting with the strict implementation of water management organizations, followed by the promulgation of construction methods, and then by the stipulation of completion in stages, with a six-month period from November 1st of last year to the end of April of this year as the preparation period for disaster prevention, strictly implementing projects such as dike repair, ditch dredging, pond management, culvert construction, and gate construction, and a five-month period from May 1st to the end of September of this year as the implementation period for disaster prevention, supplementing unfinished projects, preparing disaster prevention materials, and organizing rescue teams, with the aim of avoiding floods and droughts. In accordance with this procedure, we have tried our best to supervise and manage, and have reported to the records. According to reports from various counties and investigations by dispatched personnel, most of them have been able to comply with the implementation. If there are only ordinary floods and droughts, there should be no disasters. However, the water level has been rising recently. Taking the Yangtze River water level in Anqing on June 15th as an example, it is one foot five higher than the same day last year, only one foot three lower than the same day in the 20th year of the Republic, and only ten feet three lower than the highest water level in the 20th year of the Republic, and it is still rising sharply. The situation is the same on the Huai River. Under such circumstances, the flood of the 20th year of the Republic may reappear today. It is urgent to strengthen prevention. In addition to the main dikes of the Jiang-Huai River, which have not yet been consolidated, this department will ask the Jiangxi, Anhui, and Huaihe Engineering Bureaus to rush to repair them as soon as possible, and discuss risk prevention measures. All internal dikes in various counties should continue to be strictly supervised and repaired. We should also order the five commissioners who have been dispatched by the department to inspect water conservancy to earnestly supervise and guide. In addition to the director and water conservancy engineers in charge inspecting at any time, we are still worried that the water will continue to rise, which may lead to multiple dangerous situations. Rescue measures cannot be carried out without funds. At a time when the rural economy has not yet recovered, the people's strength is insufficient. If there is an emergency, they can only call on the government. If the government is not prepared, it will be at a loss. The lessons of the great flood of the 20th year of the Republic can be learned. It is proposed that your government quickly order the Department of Finance to generously raise funds, and, based on the interdependence of the main dikes and internal dikes, consult with the National Economic Council to request the allocation of some funds for construction, so as to be prepared for any eventuality. The funds raised and borrowed will be estimated by each county based on the number of rescue funds needed due to insufficient civil power, and used the benefited farmland as collateral to borrow from the province, ordering that after the autumn harvest, the counties are responsible for apportioning the repayment. If we are fortunate enough to have peace and tranquility, then this amount of money can still be left untouched and returned separately. Such preparations should provide more concrete methods for implementing disaster prevention. Whether it is appropriate or not, we have attached the accelerated flood control measures for public decision,</p>
<h3>Measures</h3>
<p>(1) Purpose: Since the autumn of last year, this province has been actively preparing for flood prevention, strictly implementing various tasks. Now, because of the severity of the water situation, these measures are specifically designed to strengthen the defensive forces. (2) Implementation: 1. Re-letter the Jiangxi, Anhui, and Huaihe Engineering Bureaus to expedite the consolidation of the Jiang-Huai trunk dike project and to discuss the handling of flood prevention, 2. Re-order the counties to implement flood prevention in accordance with the methods shown in the multiple orders and to implement rewards and punishments in accordance with the previously issued regulations, 3. Charge the commissioners who have been sent to inspect water conservancy projects to supervise and guide various localities to strengthen flood prevention and report the situation of various important places for verification, 4. The director and water conservancy engineers in charge shall inspect various important dikes at any time, 5. Order the Wuhu and Anqing Public Works Bureaus to quickly plan construction in accordance with the returned flood prevention measures, (3) Fundraising: The great flood of the 20th year was due to the lack of an emergency reserve fund, which led to the expansion of the disaster. This can be used as a profound lesson. The counties have complied with the order to prevent disasters, but we are still afraid that if there is an emergency, the people will not have enough resources. In addition to the implementation of the previous article, we will quickly raise funds as a backup. 1. The provincial government will ask the National Economic Council for a temporary loan of 60,000 yuan from the council's water conservancy project funds, based on the relationship between the main dikes and internal dikes and the economic relationship between the state and the people, for the counties to re-borrow. The method will be determined separately. 2. The Department of Finance will temporarily raise 20,000 yuan (5,000 yuan of which will be prepared for the Guangji Dike application according to the budget, and the remaining 15,000 yuan will also be prepared for the counties to re-borrow) for rescue purposes, 3. Allow the counties to find ways to borrow on their own in case of emergency, but the repayment should be made by the benefited farmland on a scheduled basis, 4. Inform all counties to follow the central government's previously issued regulations on encouraging the construction of water conservancy and flood prevention, and encourage gentry to donate funds for rescue, 5.

In the Dongjiang area, he has ordered the 7th and 8th Divisions of the 3rd Army to advance from Xunwu towards eastern Jiangxi. The original defense area will be filled by detachments from the 5th Division of the 2nd Army.

The 15th Regiment stationed in Hailufeng and the Training Regiment were transferred to Meixian and Fengshun counties. The defense of Huizhou will be taken over by the Training Division. In the Beijiang area, because the entire 1st Army in southern Jiangxi is about to depart, the Independent 3rd Division and Independent 2nd Brigade will be transferred to take over the defense of southern Jiangxi and will also serve as reserve forces in the future. The 1st Army is also about to be dispatched. A meeting was held in Dayu yesterday to discuss plans to advance into the bandit areas, and various tasks were slightly rearranged.

<h3>General Labor Union Remedies Unemployment Problem</h3>
<p>Telegraphs to Stop Factory Closures and Orders Workers to Strive for Production The Shanghai General Labor Union, due to the recent economic panic and the impact of foreign goods dumping, has seen factories and businesses closing down and reducing work, leading to a daily increase in the number of unemployed and a more severe unemployment problem. Yesterday, it specially telegraphed to the Central Government, requesting an explicit order to stop factory closures, and at the same time ordered workers in various industries to intensify production and support the endangered industries. The telegram and circular are separately recorded below.</p>
<h3>Telegraph to the Central Government</h3>
<p>To the Mass Movement Guidance Committee of the Central Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang and the Ministry of Industry of the National Government: Since the January 28th Incident, industry and commerce in this city have been declining, and vitality has not been restored. Various industries are showing signs of recession. Coupled with the global economic downturn in recent years, countries have built high tariff barriers to prevent the invasion of foreign goods, and then implemented dumping policies for their surplus goods, selling them at low prices to compete. Our fragile industry and commerce have suffered a major blow, and the situation is increasingly precarious. As a result, factories in various industries such as cotton yarn, tea, silk, and rubber have recently closed down or reduced work one after another. The number of unemployed is increasing daily. If fundamental relief is not sought quickly, our country's industries will inevitably be in complete danger, and the impact on national taxation and people's livelihood will be significant and far-reaching. However, considering the reasons for the closure and reduction of work by various manufacturers, the majority are indeed due to excessive losses and the inflexibility of funds, making it impossible to maintain operations. However, there are also not a few who arbitrarily close down or reduce work because there are no substantial profits to be made. Moreover, there are a few stubborn capitalists who, because of their hostility towards worker organizations and their desire to undermine worker unity, are even using closure as a means of coercion. This has ultimately caused the entire society to fall into an increasingly precarious and uneasy state. After thinking about it, I cannot help but sigh. It is found that our country's industry and commerce are facing the oppression of international capitalism and the harassment of Red bandits and wars, and are on the verge of collapse. The hard-working workers who toil with their own hands are feeling pain under these circumstances that is especially dire. Under these adverse circumstances, labor and management should understand each other, unite as one, and work together in the spirit of cooperation to seek survival. There should be no further infighting, causing disputes, and bringing about self-destruction. This association, being the leader of all the workers in Shanghai, has witnessed this dangerous situation and cannot remain silent. In addition to ordering workers in various industries to work hard and increase work efficiency, so as to reduce the cost of products and compete with foreign goods, I beg your association (ministry) to consider that industry is on the verge of collapse and the people's livelihood is difficult, to properly plan a fundamental relief plan for unemployed workers. On the one hand, strictly order capitalists in various industries not to take the opportunity of poor business conditions to suddenly announce closure or reduction of work, so as to increase the number of unemployed. If it is indeed due to excessive losses and it is impossible to maintain operations, they should also submit an application to the party and government organs for approval in advance, in order to value industry and stabilize the people's livelihood. The telegram is sent with utmost urgency, awaiting orders. Shanghai General Labor Union respectfully, Hao.</p>
<h3>Order to Various Trade Unions</h3>
<p>Regarding the issuance of a circular: It has been found that factories and businesses in various industries in this city have recently closed down or reduced work one after another, and the number of unemployed workers is increasing daily. The reasons for this are that some capitalists disregard the lives of workers and arbitrarily close factories and reduce work, and there are also many who are unable to maintain operations due to social economic panic and inflexibility of funds. In addition to submitting a request to the Central Government to issue an explicit order to stop factories from arbitrarily closing down and reducing work, this association specially orders you to instruct all workers to follow the spirit of labor-management cooperation at this time of national crisis and the danger of industry, and to abide by this association's announcement of suppression, to work hard and intensify work, so that the output will increase and the cost will be reduced, and to be able to compete with foreign goods. And also to find ways to avoid labor disputes, in order to support the industry that is about to collapse, and also to seek the stability of the lives of the workers themselves. This matter is of great importance, and you should instruct all workers to comply accordingly. This association has high hopes for this. This order.</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau Responded Yesterday to the Salary Increase Case for Railway Staff and Clerks Upon Order</h3>
<p>The annual two-phase assessment of performance and progressive salary increase for railway staff and clerks; representatives came to Shanghai to petition the Railway Bureau. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway staff and clerks requested a salary increase for the 22nd year, with a deadline for a reply. The administrations of the two railways received a telegram from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, and immediately responded. Representatives of the staff and clerks came to Shanghai yesterday to petition the Railway Bureau. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Staff and Clerks Petition</h3>
<p>Zheng Qiao and 18 others from the Beijing-Shanghai Section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway's 22nd Annual Salary Increase Movement Delegation came to Shanghai from Wuxi yesterday morning. They immediately held a discussion meeting at the unions of the two railways, and at around 11:00 am, Chen Bohua, the director of the two railway unions, together requested an early reply from the Railway Bureau. Director Huang Boqiao received them and said that the Ministry of Railways had decided on a plan and that it would be announced by the Ministry.</p>
<h3>Declaration Seeking Assistance</h3>
<p>The Wage Increase Movement Representative Delegation of the Beijing-Shanghai Section Sub-Office of the Railway Union of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Under the Direct Jurisdiction of the Ministry of Railways issued a declaration yesterday, stating: To all levels of party headquarters, all agencies, and all groups in the country: We have learned that the salaries received by the road service staff and clerks of the two railways who have entered the road service are so low that it is difficult to maintain a living (only 15 yuan per month). Fortunately, since the opening of this road, there has been a precedent for annual wage increases, which is the only hope of the staff and clerks and the price for the year-round hard work and toil of the entire road's staff and clerks. For more than 20 years, it has been continued and has never been delayed, at the latest, it will be announced between January and February of each year. Although all the staff and clerks of the road are in a situation where the level of life is increasing year by year, they are still able to strive on their own, and not to increase the production of the entire road with the achievements of common efforts, and not to abandon their due qualifications with the concept of meager salaries. Recently, the road authorities have rumored to stop the annual wage increase, "saying that there must be special achievements before a reward can be added." The position of the road service staff and clerks is diligent and untiring, working hard day and night, doing their best, only seeking to be faultless, not seeking merit, and the road service staff and clerks are restricted by their powers and duties, and there is no reason to be meritorious. Therefore, if you must discuss with special circumstances, the road service personnel will never have the hope of a salary increase. This is to directly deprive the road service staff and clerks of all future expectations. Moreover, other sections of the road in the 標工 (public works) field, once requested, will be issued wage increases one after another, and our road service staff and clerks' annual wage increase for this year has been put aside and ignored by the road authorities, delayed for half a year, and no announcement has been made. The same road bureau, the same environment, and the measures taken by the road authorities are so discriminatory. It is really incomprehensible after thinking about it a hundred times. After the road service colleagues jointly requested the continuation of the wage increase, the bureau once again turned a deaf ear, and reiterated the ban, forbidding anyone to mention the annual wage increase again, high-pressure intimidation, and binding restrictions. On the other hand, it sang the high tune of cutting road staff, and in fact, the newly added a large number of redundant staff have evidence to be checked, and all treatments are more preferential than those who have been serving on the road for 20 or 30 years. The public's feelings are indignant, and they are forced to hold a meeting on June 15 by representatives elected by all the staff and clerks of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to pursue the 22nd annual wage increase. The delegates have been identified as 19 working officials, who will proceed separately and begin handling matters, and it has been resolved to telegraph the authorities and make a formal request, with a deadline for reply. Since the telegram was sent, there has been no satisfactory and honest expression of confirmation. Although the Road Administration Bureau has issued a telegram, it is only perfunctory and has no sincere statement. It is found that in the past, when the authority of this road was in the hands of the British, they did not dare to make any difficulties regarding the annual wage increase, but now, under the Qing Dynasty, the sunny days, and the party's rule, there is such a disregard for everything. The representatives are entrusted by all the staff and clerks of the road and should take the interests of all the staff and clerks of the road as the goal of their struggle. In addition to abiding by the guidance of the party headquarters and trade unions of this road, and proceeding with legal procedures, we hope that all colleagues from all walks of life will provide assistance for justice, and it is fortunate to be so. This declaration is respectfully made,</p>
<h3>Letter to Colleagues</h3>
<p>The salary increase movement delegation issued a letter of respect to the colleagues of the road service department station team, stating: Of all the work on the railway, the most cumbersome, the most responsible, the worst paid, and the lowest paid are the colleagues of the road service department station team. Try to observe other parts of this road to know this. However, they are still able to do their best, devote their spirit, endure without complaint, and be loyal to their duties. There is still a so-called line of hope for annual wage increases. It has been a long time since it was established, and it has never been changed. Therefore, it has always been safe and sound, only knowing to work hard for the public, abide by regulations, serve, obey orders, and be cautious in their work. Moreover, it was in the era of warlords and foreign pressure, so there is no need to say more. Unexpectedly, the annual wage increase this year has not yet been announced. Although not long ago, a joint petition was also sent to the bureau, but it also became invalid. Now, it is not only like this, but there is also a move to stop the increase from now on, that is, a line of hope is also deprived, and there is permanent despair. It is found that in recent years, the work has become more cumbersome, and the responsibility has also become more important. However, the bureau has often dismissed and severely punished road staff, and in comparison, the obligations and rights, the gains and losses are so great that it is unbearable to say. However, it is also necessary to say that this is not to say, it is the voice of the weak, the injustice of the weak. As for a few colleagues, do not have a heart of bystanders because the current salary is slightly higher, because the daily income is at most only able to maintain the status quo, and if there is an unforeseen need, it is also necessary to cut flesh to mend sores. More should be considered about the past pain of small wages and the reason why the current salary is higher is also entirely due to the annual wage increase. Therefore, after the pain is determined, it is known that the pain is right in the pain and more. Therefore, all my colleagues in the road service station team who want to maintain their inherent personal interests, the only hope, not to be deprived, should unite as one, have a beginning and an end, should concentrate their strength, and move forward bravely, without hesitation or hesitation. This is the time for the colleagues to die first, and the rightful demands are not extravagant, and there is only one day of success in being open and aboveboard, united, and striving. On the one hand, colleagues are still expected to serve as usual, to await the good news of the report of the delegation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Assistance</h3>
<p>The group received a telegram of assistance from all members of the Shanghai-Hangzhou section sub-office at around 3 pm yesterday, stating that the Shanghai North Station Chief was sending a salary increase movement delegation to Beijing-Shanghai, and sending copies to the party headquarters and trade unions of the two railways, as well as to all levels of party headquarters, trade unions, departments, sections, factories, and road station teams. I know about the clever telegram, and the colleagues of this road are determined to be the backing, hoping to strive hard and persevere, the staff council of the Shanghai-Hangzhou section sub-office of the two railway unions and all members bow, Hao.</p>
<h3>Railway Ministry Measures</h3>
<p>Huang Boqiao, Director of the Railway Administration of the two railways, requested instructions from the Ministry because the salary increase requested by the staff and clerks was in conflict with the regulations on the salaries of state-owned railway employees. Yesterday afternoon, he received a telegram from the Ministry of Railways, stating that "the salary increase for staff and clerks will be divided into two phases in June and December each year, and the daily performance of the staff and clerks will be assessed by the chiefs and officers of each department and submitted by the bureau to the Minister of Railways for approval and progressive increase." After receiving the telegram, the staff and clerks were immediately answered,</p>
<h3>Staff and Clerks Meeting</h3>
<p>The salary increase movement delegation decided that the reply of the Railway Bureau was in line with Article 5 of the Regulations on the Salaries of State-Owned Railway Employees, which states that those who are diligent and conscientious in their daily work and have meritorious service may be submitted by the bureau to the Ministry of Railways for approval and progressive promotion by one level. It was decided to hold separate meetings in Wuxi and Jiaxing to solicit opinions on the reply. If they are satisfied, the process will be stopped, otherwise, further measures will be taken.</p>
<h3>Students Expelled from Japan Invited the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>Detailing the details of the abuse and torture in Japan, the Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Expelled Return Group was organized by the students who were unreasonably expelled by the Japanese government. Yesterday at 2 pm, they invited reporters and representatives of various groups at the Sima Road Central Western Restaurant to report the expulsion process. More than 30 guests and hosts attended. First, Chairman Zhou Ying stood up to address the meeting, thanking the press for their past guidance and assistance, hoping that they would give more extensive publicity in the future to arouse the attention of the compatriots across the country to the vicious means of the Japanese imperialists. Then, Mr. Pan Xianzhang reported the expulsion process. Mr. Pan first stated that after the September 18th Incident, the students in Japan, aroused by indignation, organized the Chinese Students' Association, and united with various overseas Chinese groups to establish a Refugee Relief Association, striving for the anti-imperialist and anti-Japanese movement, raising huge sums of money to help the Northeastern Volunteers and the compatriots who were in distress. He then stated that the Japanese government was concerned about the liberation and national movement of the overseas Chinese, and from March 15th onwards, the cadres of the Chinese Students' Association were unreasonably arrested one after another, totaling more than 50 people. They were interrogated every day, and cruel tortures were inflicted, wooden sticks and iron rods were used in combination, water was poured into the nose, hung up and beaten, and branded with fire. If they fainted, they would be poured with cold water to wake them up, and then cruel tortures would be inflicted. The situation was indescribable in words. By June 1st, they were released under the pretext of release, and they were expelled back to the country, and a deposit of 50 yuan was taken to buy boat tickets. Then, they were escorted to the pier and locked in a small room under the bow of the ship. They arrived in the motherland a few days ago, and their actions were finally free. Mr. Pan concluded by saying that after returning to the country this time, we will continue to strive for the anti-imperialist and anti-Japanese movement and continue to fight, hoping that all sectors will provide assistance, and protest to the Japanese government to rescue the overseas Chinese who have not yet been released from prison, until about 4 pm before dispersing.

Mr. Yang had one bullet wound in his chest, which exited from his right rib, and another bullet wound in his right side, which did not penetrate. During the examination, Mr. Yang's head was slightly turned westward, his short hair disheveled, as if he were asleep. The assailant, Gao Dechen, was lying in a separate room to the west, his eyes wide open, looking terrifying. He had one bullet wound in his right arm, which went through a hole in his left neck, with bloodstains evident. At the time of the examination, the medicinal cotton in his neck was still red.</p>
<h3>Prosecutor's Interrogation</h3>
<p>After the examination, Prosecutor Chen Beisan took his seat and began the official inquiry. First, a police detective reported the details of the incident, presenting a pair of bloodstained shorts, two five-yuan bills, two double-dime coins, more than ten copper coins, and a key belonging to the assailant Gao Dechen. According to the report, the incident occurred at around 8:00 AM yesterday (i.e., the day before). Police officer number 104 was the first to arrive after hearing the alarm and pursued the assailant. Due to the large number of pedestrians, he did not fire his weapon. The assailant was wounded by self-inflicted wounds, and after the rioters fired, they said, "Okay, okay," and then scattered and fled. The prosecutor then briefly questioned Yang Xin, the brother of the deceased, who stated that his name was Xin, courtesy name Jifu, age 51, from Qingjiang, Jiangxi. He lived on Xin Zha Road and worked as an official in the Ministry of Transportation. The deceased was his own brother. He heard the news and rushed over at 1:00 PM that afternoon. He heard that three or four people were involved in the attack. He did not know the assailant, Gao Dechen, and was unclear about the motive for the attack. He would arrange for the body to be sent to the International Funeral Home for embalming. A police detective then reported that photographs of the deceased had been taken and sketches of the bullet wounds had been made. The prosecutor then declared that Yang Xingfo died from gunshot wounds sustained before his death, and his body would be released to his family for burial (and Yang Xin signed the document). Gao Dechen died by suicide with a handgun, and since he had no family, the Tongren Fuyuantang would be responsible for his coffin and burial. After the examination, they returned to the court by car at around 10:00 AM. The sister of the deceased then burst into tears, filled with grief.</p>
<h3>Transfer to Funeral Home</h3>
<p>After the examination, the staff of the Academia Sinica immediately notified the Wan Funeral Home by telephone to send a car to Guangci Hospital to transport the remains of Mr. Yang to the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road. However, because another family was already holding a funeral downstairs, Mr. Yang's body was transported upstairs, where his family members accompanied and cared for the body, and hired a doctor to inject preservatives.</p>
<h3>Condolences and Wreaths</h3>
<p>Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, visited Guangci Hospital yesterday morning to offer condolences, shedding tears of grief. Zhu Jiahua also visited to offer condolences. Later, those who went to the funeral home to offer condolences included Duan Xipeng, former Vice Minister of Education, Tan Guang of the Salt Revenue Audit Office, and Wang Yunwu of the Commercial Press. Those who sent wreaths included Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai, Kong Xiangxi, the President of the Central Bank, and the Commercial Press.</p>
<h3>Xiao Fo and the Driver</h3>
<p>Yang's son, Xiao Fo, is still being treated at Guangci Hospital. His condition has improved, and he has a good appetite. His driver, Qiang Xiangda, is still being treated at the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society on Avenue Haig. Yesterday, his spirits were good, and his fever was not high. However, because the bullet has not yet been removed, there are concerns about complications, so he is still in a dangerous period. As for the body of the assailant Gao Dechen, yesterday the Tongren Fuyuantang sent a hearse to collect the coffin and transport it to the cemetery in Pudong for burial.</p>
<h3>Burial Set for Today</h3>
<p>The colleagues of the Academia Sinica have repeatedly consulted on the arrangements for Mr. Yang's funeral. It is generally understood that they will use traditional Chinese clothing and bedding, having already purchased a set of Indian silk short shirts and trousers, a lined jacket, and a mandarin gown, Mr. Yang's favorite, in the original color, as well as a matching vest, shoes, and hat. As for the coffin, whether it will be Chinese or Western style, and the location of the burial site, these matters are still being decided. The date of the encoffining has been set for 2:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Assistance</h3>
<p>The municipal government is paying close attention to the assassination of Mr. Yang. However, because the incident occurred in the International Settlement, the municipal government was unable to provide protection beforehand. According to a person in charge of the municipal government, in addition to reporting the details of Mr. Yang's assassination to the central government, the municipal government has also instructed the Public Security Bureau to cooperate with the authorities in the International Settlement to strictly apprehend the murderers and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Cai Yuanpei's Remarks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper's reporter met with Mr. Cai Yuanpei at the International Funeral Home. According to him, the central government has not yet sent a telegram regarding Mr. Yang's assassination. Yang was a scholar, and this unexpected tragedy shows that the lives of the people are not guaranteed. He could not help but express his grief. He also said that Madam Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, did not come today (i.e., yesterday), and the China League for Civil Rights is temporarily inactive.</p>
<h3>Tianchu Airplane Lands Yesterday</h3>
<p>Trial Flight to be Scheduled After Assembly</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory in this city ordered a Junkers-style fighter plane from the Curtiss Company of the United States. It has already been shipped to Shanghai. The company's manager in China sent personnel to retrieve it from customs yesterday morning. After the aircraft parts are assembled, the date of the trial flight will be determined. In the meantime, the Aviation Association has contacted the Aviation Administration, requesting that personnel be sent to Shanghai for the trial flight. After the trial flight, the plane will be incorporated into the Aviation Administration's air squadron for national defense purposes. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory told the Xin Xin reporter that the factory's donation of an airplane was purely out of patriotic enthusiasm, but this has attracted the attention of some parties, so no further news can be announced at this time.</p>
<h3>Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, during the January 28th Incident last year, the Japanese used their air power to wantonly bomb the bustling urban areas of Zhabei and innocent compatriots. After the incident ended, the people were displaced and their homes were destroyed. The citizens witnessed the tragedy and deeply understood the necessity of building an air force. At the beginning of this year, the citizens, with the assistance of the government, organized the China Aviation Association. Starting in February, they raised a large sum of money and ordered eighteen fighter planes. The Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory in this city generously donated 100,000 yuan to purchase one plane on its own. The plane was shipped from (Isart) to Shanghai. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 18th, but was delayed en route due to an incident. It finally arrived here last night. The customs clearance was done last night. The Aviation Association had previously telegraphed Hangzhou to the Aviation Administration to request the issuance of a passport, and the Aviation Administration had sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance requesting tax-free import. All formalities were completed, so the manager of the airplane factory in China sent personnel to retrieve it from customs yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Advantages of the Aircraft</h3>
<p>The aircraft is manufactured by the Swedish Ae flight Aircraft Factory and is a German Junkers K47 fighter plane. The entire aircraft is made of metal, so it is extremely resistant to damage. It has two seats, and there is a shooting rack in front of the seat for installing a machine gun. Another machine gun can be added temporarily. The machine gun in the rear seat can be moved freely in all directions, and can also be aimed upwards, which is one of the special features of the aircraft. Large and small bombs can be placed on the wings and under the fuselage of the aircraft and fired instantly. There is a telephone and indicator system in the middle for measuring everything in advance, and a (Minimax) fire extinguisher is installed in case of emergency.</p>
<h3>Flight Speed</h3>
<p>The aircraft has approximately 500 horsepower. The net payload is 590 kilograms, and the total weight is approximately 1700 kilograms. It can hold 340 liters of fuel, with an endurance of three and a half hours, or approximately 850 kilometers. The maximum altitude it can reach is 8600 meters. The climb rate is 1000 meters in the first two minutes. The speed is 240 kilometers per hour.</p>
<h3>Naming Ceremony</h3>
<p>Fang Zhicheng, an employee of the factory, visited Lin Wojiang, the Secretary-General of the China Aviation Association, yesterday afternoon to discuss the location and date of the naming ceremony and prepare for the event. According to the reporter, the aircraft will be equipped by the pilot sent by the aircraft factory to China, or it will be stored at the Hongqiao Airport. The date and location of the naming ceremony will be determined after the equipment is installed, possibly in early July. The location has not yet been determined, as the fuselage of the aircraft is relatively large, and if a trial flight is required, a large location is required. It was originally planned to be at the Jiangwan Racecourse, but it is difficult to take off and land because the runway is surrounded by fences. The pilot will need to select the location. If it is not suitable, it will be changed to Hongqiao. In addition to the Aviation Administration sending a pilot, the factory will also send the pilot who previously flew a Junkers aircraft for the Eurasia Aviation Corporation from Europe to China to fly the aircraft.</p>
<h3>Chan Chen's Letter</h3>
<p>Chan Chen &amp; Co. sent a letter yesterday stating: "To the editor of Shen Bao, We are writing to you regarding the news about the Tianchu airplane in today's newspaper. There are some inaccuracies in the report. The airplane of the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory was ordered from our company. It is a Junkers-style fighter plane from the German Junkers factory, equipped with three machine guns. The plane has now arrived in Shanghai and is being prepared for unloading. For other information about the airplane, please inquire with our Chinese accounting department, who will provide you with accurate details. Respectfully, Chan Chen &amp; Co., June 19, 1933."</p>

<p>Submerged Reefs Discovered in the Yangtze River</p>
<h3>Upper Reaches of Wuhu</h3>
<p>The Yangtze River is Changing! The Qing Tian, a Yangtze River surveying vessel of the Ministry of the Navy, discovered a submerged reef during its recent trip to the upper reaches of Wuhu. The reef is located northeast of Yudieji, below Anqing, approximately due north of the bell tower of the Anglican Church on Daguan Mountain at approximately 118 degrees 20 minutes east longitude and 31 degrees 19 minutes north latitude. The reef has a depth of 5 feet and is a very dangerous hazard to navigation. Another submerged reef was also discovered nearby, located 192 degrees due north of Daguan Mountain at a distance of 2.32 nautical miles, at the same east longitude and 31 degrees 19 minutes north latitude. This reef has a depth of 10 feet. Both reefs pose a danger to navigation. All shipping companies and Yangtze River vessels have been notified.</p>
<h3>Yantai Harbor</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from the Yantai Port Director, a submerged reef with a depth of approximately 14 feet suddenly appeared in the Yantai inner harbor at mooring point number 8, approximately 303.5 degrees due north of the Yantai Mountain lighthouse at approximately 121 degrees 24 minutes east longitude and 37 degrees 33 minutes north latitude. This location is where Northern Ocean ships must anchor when entering Yantai. All shipping companies in this port have been notified, and mooring point number 8 has been designated as a dangerous and prohibited anchorage.</p>
<h3>Swire Labor Strike Expands</h3>
<p>Two More Ships Engage in Work Stoppage, Guangdong Merchants Suspend Loading Goods Yesterday. The Swire Shipping Company, a British-owned company, caused a labor strike among sailors from Guangdong when it laid off employees in the kitchen of the Wusong ship. Two ships on the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Guangdong route have also joined the strike. As of yesterday, Guangdong merchants in Shanghai have stopped loading Swire ships, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. Details are listed below:</p>
<h3>Sailors Negotiating</h3>
<p>After the labor strike of the Foshan and other ships on the Guangdong-Hong Kong route, the Shandong ship on the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Guangdong route also joined the strike. The company has dispatched the Ganzhou ship to replace the Shandong ship. The Guangdong Sailors' Association has reportedly submitted demands to the Swire Company. First, all of the mid-cabin workers who were dismissed from the Wusong ship should be unconditionally reinstated. Second, all losses incurred by the workers who were dismissed or suspended should be fully compensated by the company. The company has not yet made a concrete response to these demands.</p>
<h3>Two Ships Strike</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Sailors' Association, to support the workers of the Wusong ship, previously announced a work stoppage by all workers on the Shandong ship. Four ships, including the Foshan, in Hong Kong subsequently responded. The Xinjiang ship, which sailed from Shanghai, also joined the strike after arriving in Guangzhou the day before yesterday (the 17th). The Jinhua ship on the Hong Kong-Guangdong route also launched a strike in Guangzhou at the same time, so the situation is becoming increasingly serious.</p>
<h3>Union Meeting</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Ships' Mid-Cabin Workers Union, in preparation for dealing with this serious dispute, convened a meeting of representatives from mid-cabin workers from various ships at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 50 people attended. Chairman Zhou Xiaoting reported that he had received a telegram from the Guangdong branch informing him that workers on various ships in Guangdong were engaging in work stoppages to support their comrades on the Wusong ship, and that the Shanghai side should make appropriate preparations. The following resolutions were then passed: (1) Mid-cabin workers on various ships in Shanghai will temporarily wait for the results of the negotiations in Guangdong. (2) All mid-cabin workers on various ships should quickly provide financial assistance to achieve victory. (3) Telegraph the workers on the Wusong ship to wait for a resolution and not take any action. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were passed.</p>
<h3>Passenger and Freight Loading Suspended</h3>
<p>Swire &amp; Co. has the premier shipping line, which runs to the ports and coastal cities in China. Four of their ships set sail each week with a large amount of export cargo. The majority of the cargo is loaded by merchants of Guangdong. However, since the Cantonese sailors started the work stoppage, the Cantonese from Shanghai, Hankou, Qingdao and other ports, who have always used Swire ships to transport their cargo are now concerned that their goods will be affected by the strike. Thus, as of yesterday, the 19th, Guangdong merchants from the ports of Shanghai, Qingdao and Hankou have unanimously decided to stop loading their cargo onto Swire ships.</p>
<h3>Transfer to Other Ships</h3>
<p>Starting yesterday, the Guangdong merchants who used to ship goods from the northern ports of Qingdao, the Yangtze River, and other ports to Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, have refused to use Swire ships and are now negotiating tonnage with Jardine Matheson. All of the cargo is being carried by Jardine ships. The Zesheng ship, which is sailing to South China today, is fully loaded. The Guangdong goods that could not be loaded on the Zesheng ship and the goods from local Guangdong merchants are being loaded onto the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yushun ship. Because of the Guangdong merchants' suspension of shipping, the strength of the striking sailors has greatly increased, which may lead to an early resolution of the Wusong issue.</p>
<h3>Maigen Road Station Workers Go to Beijing Yesterday to Petition</h3>
<p>The case of the Maigen Road Station on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway opposing the Railway Bureau's restoration of the contracting system has been going on for ten days and has not yet been resolved. The Central People's Movement Guidance Committee specially sent Li Renzhu, together with Guo Zhongyang and Xing of the Ministry of Railways, to Shanghai to investigate the truth. The loading and unloading workers, worried that the delay would affect their livelihoods, sent 34 representatives, including Shen Yuqing, Song Kaigui, Zheng Yongxing, and Zhang Ziyu, led by Min Luo, the director of the two railway workers' unions, to Beijing at 5:00 AM yesterday to petition the Central Party Headquarters' People's Movement Committee and the Ministry of Railways, requesting that they consider the workers' livelihoods and revoke the contracting order.</p>
<h3>Duan Zhiquan's Health Improved by Blood Transfusion</h3>
<p>Doctors Say Three Blood Transfusions Needed According to a secretary at Duan's residence, No. 1487 Avenue Joffre, since Mr. Duan received two blood transfusions from Austrian doctor Müller, his health has been gradually improving and his spirits are high. In addition to walking in the garden every day, he also participates in Buddhist activities, recites scriptures, and plays chess with others. However, according to Dr. Müller's diagnosis, a third blood transfusion is still needed and is currently being prepared. The first donor was his nephew, surnamed Chen, and the second was Duan's second nephew, Hongye. It is said that the third transfusion will be from his fourth nephew's son, who went to Dr. Müller's office yesterday to have his blood tested. During the transfusion, the donor's blood is first placed in a cup and warmed with hot water, without Mr. Duan seeing it. It is then drawn into a needle through a rubber tube and injected into his body in a separate room.</p>
<h3>Seventh Batch of Displaced Mexicans Did Not Arrive Yesterday</h3>
<p>Took Another Ship and Will Return at the End of the Month More than 100 displaced Mexicans, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday (the 19th) morning on the President Harrison ship, were met at the Dalae Pier in Pudong by Tan Zishan, a representative of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Huang Zhulin, the President of the Shanghai Mexican Displaced Overseas Chinese Relief Association, Lin Wenli, the Vice President, representatives Zhang Baiyu, Zhen Xin, Huang Sheng, and Chen Hanbin, Xie Jianping, and Fang Di Fei, representatives of the Global Overseas Chinese General Association. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. The President Harrison ship, originally a world-class ship, was unable to accommodate more than 100 displaced persons because the third-class cabins were not yet repaired. The ship only carried more than a dozen American overseas Chinese in the third-class cabins. It is said that the seventh batch of displaced persons will take the President Jackson ship, which will arrive in Shanghai on the 24th of this month.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Association Opposes the Collection of Fisheries Construction Fees</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Association's Circular Telegram: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Industry, Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, Provincial Government, Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, Municipal Government, Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters, Provincial Government, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Commerce, All Zhejiang Associations, All Legal Entities, All Newspapers: In April of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Executive Yuan Order No. 1600 and the National Government Civil Affairs Office Order No. 2487 stipulated that all fish taxes and fishery taxes should be exempt, and that no organization, regardless of its nature, should establish new taxes or fees under any name. All fishermen and fish merchants were deeply grateful, believing that the government's consideration for the fisheries industry was meticulous. However, recently, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Committee's Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office was established. The association falsely claims to be organized by Jiangsu and Zhejiang fishermen and fish merchants' groups, but it has been found that the well-known fishing areas and official associations of fish merchants in the outer seas and inland rivers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have absolutely not been consulted. It is clear that a few people are taking advantage of the situation for their own benefit and are not legally constituted. Since its establishment, the association has been using the name of construction to violate central laws and establish collection sub-offices in various districts within the two provinces, forcing fishmongers and merchants to collect fees on their behalf. What does 'collecting on behalf' mean? Because the association stated that the fees would be taken from the fishing industry, they should be collected directly from fishermen in the marine fishing areas. However, the association clearly knows that it is impossible to collect fees from fishermen in terms of law and in practice, so it uses other tricks, replacing it with the two words 'collecting on behalf', placing it on the shoulders of fish merchants and vendors. However, they don't realize that there are various impossible facts of merchants and vendors collecting on behalf. Because fishermen rely on government laws to collect fees from them, they will inevitably resist to the death. This is the first reason why it is impossible to collect on behalf. Fishermen directly trade with fishmongers. It is the responsibility of merchants to collect fees from fishmongers, but fishmongers operate on a small scale, and the name and reality do not match, so they will definitely not recognize additional expenses. This is the second reason why it is impossible to collect on behalf. Merchants and vendors often give credit to fishermen, so if they are forced to collect on behalf, there will inevitably be many disputes in the future, and as a result, the merchants will suffer losses. This is the third reason why it is impossible to collect on behalf. The so-called 'collecting on behalf' is only in name, but the truth is that fish merchants are being coerced into donating. For example, in the same fishing area, those who have already been taxed in District A must be taxed again when transported to District B. The same is true when transported from District B to Districts C and D. Collection is done for the division of shipping and taxation with each dropoff. It is no different from the establishment of checkpoints by the Likin Bureau to collect donations. Moreover, the principle of collection is that it is taken from the fishing industry, and the collection method is that fees must be paid for fresh, salted, dried, or shellfish products. Therefore, all dried shellfish products transported from overseas and other provinces, after being taxed by customs, are also subject to collection. May I ask what kind of method can be used by merchants to obtain the right to collect fees from fishermen from overseas and other provinces for these shellfish products? I am afraid there is no such method in the world. Also, according to its regulations, those who are less than a catty are exempt from collection. However, according to recent receipts for fees collected in various places, those who weigh 30 to 40 catties have been forced to donate, and even those whose items are not named on the bill have been forced to pay tens of dollars. All of this is based on concrete evidence. It is said that the association holds support and insists on going its own way. People are sent out everywhere to inspect merchants' signs and investigate business capital, as if in addition to collecting disguised Likin fees, they must also levy a business tax. If they are slightly dissatisfied, they will seize ships and goods, causing not only fresh fish and other items to rot and be discarded, making them unsalable, but also imposing harsh penalties, imposing fines of five to ten times the amount. As a result, business capital has been lost incalculably. Such harassment and oppression of fish merchants is unbearable for the industry. The Shanghai and Hangzhou Chambers of Commerce have repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to order them to stop and to change the implementation method as soon as possible, but no instructions have been received. May you have compassion for the pain and concern of merchants and not recognize this disguised Likin fee and the additional business tax. In addition to submitting separately, we have attached four photographs of evidence of violations to be reviewed. We humbly request that you order a stop to the collection and revoke the original case in order to relieve merchants of their difficulties and exempt them from harsh taxes. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Association kowtows."</p>
<h3>Order</h3>
<p>Since the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industry established the collection of fisheries construction fees, it has aroused unanimous opposition from fishermen and fish merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Association received letters from various industry associations yesterday, informing the Zhejiang Provincial Party Executive Committee. For this reason, it issued an order to all county and level party headquarters to investigate the harassment situation of the collection in detail and report back truthfully for verification. The original order states: "According to the reports from the South Goods Industry and Fisheries Industry Associations of various counties, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Committee suddenly established offices in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Shaoxing, and posted notices to collect fisheries construction fees starting on April 14, and sent a large number of tax collectors to inspect and collect fees everywhere, seizing goods and harassing at will. The collection of fisheries construction fees is specifically for the protection of fishery safety and has absolutely nothing to do with fish merchants. Now, various places are using coercive means to force our merchants to pay, which is tantamount to the revival of a disguised Likin and the production of illegal exactions. Please approve the transfer to the central government for an explicit order to abolish, and so on. According to this, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Committee's collection of fisheries construction fees has not been notified by the Ministry of Industry and the Provincial Government, and the collection methods and tax uses are not clear. Now, according to the previous situation, in addition to writing to the Provincial Government to investigate and reply, and separately ordering, this order is hereby issued to the Party Headquarters to comply and immediately investigate the harassment situation of personnel collecting fees in various places, as well as the tax uses and collection locations, and report back in detail and truthfully for verification. This matter concerns the livelihood of the people and must not be delayed. This order, etc."</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry Sends Yuan Lianghua to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Investigates Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Dispute After the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Association of the Ministry of Industry collected construction fees, it caused various disputes. After receiving the accusations, the Ministry of Industry believed that it was necessary to investigate the improvement and reorganization of the fishery situation, as well as whether the collection of fees was harsh or not. The Ministry of Industry sent Yuan Lianghua, a specialist from the Ministry, on the Beijing-Shanghai train yesterday. After arriving in Shanghai, he will consult with Chen Liangzhong, the Director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Administration, fishery experts, and various fishery organizations on everything, and then go to various fishing areas along the coasts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to investigate the situation separately. Within the scope of possibility, he will formulate a plan for the development of the fish industry for selection.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Resubmits Request to the Executive Yuan and Ministry to Allocate Funds to the Arsenal</h3>
<p>State Loans are Also Private Legal Actions, Contracts are Established and Subject to Civil Law The Shanghai Arsenal base is said to be for sale. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in its capacity as a creditor, telegraphed the Ministries of Military Affairs and Finance, requesting that they comply with the original plan, quickly raise and return the funds. The Ministry of Military Affairs has now replied to the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce has resubmitted the request to the Executive Yuan and rejected the reply from the Ministry of Military Affairs. The original text of the approvals and submissions are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3>Ministry of Military Affairs' Approval</h3>
<p>Received the submission. Upon investigation, the Shanghai Arsenal is a central industry managed by this Ministry, and no local civil or military officials may dispose of it. The so-called allocation as security for a loan is an illegal measure. This Ministry is responsible for its management and cannot readily agree to it. You are hereby notified. This approval.</p>
<h3>Continued Report from the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Report for the matter of submitting a request (again). It concerns the matter of designating a base for Shanghai factories, and the previously approved appropriation of proceeds from the sale of land to cover various advances. The military department's official response rejected the proposed arrangement, causing profound dismay. Upon investigation, this matter originated in the spring of the 14th year of the Republic (1925), when the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce advanced funds for disbanding soldiers, providing supplies, and transportation. This was approved by the former Ministry of the Army and the Ministry of Finance, with the property of the Shanghai Arsenal as collateral. As the Ministry of the Army was indeed the competent authority for the Shanghai Arsenal, as stated in the directive from your department (Military Affairs), allocating the arsenal's property as collateral for advances was within its jurisdiction. There was no "illegal measure" as alleged. The directive's statement that "no local civil or military officials are entitled to dispose of" is misdirected when applied to the Ministry of the Army, and requires no further refutation. National borrowing is also a matter of private law. Once a contract is established, it is subject to civil law. Except for a court with jurisdiction to render a judgment, there is no basis for unilaterally repudiating it through administrative orders. Moreover, in May of the 18th year (1929), the Ministry of Finance submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, which issued an instruction for approval, directing notification to the Ministry of Military Affairs for compliance. Your department is a subordinate department within the Executive Yuan's system and has a clear responsibility to comply with the Yuan's orders. Considering established precedents and the administrative system, there is no room for deviation. The Ministry of Military Affairs, merely for the sake of facilitating the diversion of land prices, disregards the debt agreement and attempts to overturn the Executive Yuan's explicit approval to maintain the original plan, betraying national integrity and disappointing public expectations. Therefore, we respectfully submit this report again to your department (Yuan) for review. We request that you implement the original plan, investigate the May 18th directive to the Ministry of Finance, and instruct the Ministry of Military Affairs to comply, allocating the proceeds from the proposed sale of land primarily to repay the aforementioned advances, as it is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Executive Yuan.</p>

The district offices will coordinate and make every effort to persuade landowners to purchase the bonds. (3) The county chief proposed that the county education bureau should draft a plan to establish primary schools in townships, in accordance with the instructions.

<h3>The Red Cross Relieves the Shaanxi Disaster</h3>
<p>Shaanxi Province has suffered from years of continuous disasters, and the people are impoverished. This year's disaster is especially severe. Recently, all parties have been working to provide relief to Shaanxi Province without reservation. The local Chinese Red Cross recently responded to General Zhu Ziqiao's request by allocating 1,100 large bags of relief rice and 157 bags of relief clothing, which will soon be shipped from Shanghai to Haizhou and then transported to Shaanxi via the Longhai Railway to meet urgent needs. It is reported that the Ministry of Railways has agreed to provide free transportation for these relief supplies.</p>
<h3>The Four Warships Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The four destroyers of the Japanese Twenty-Fourth Destroyer Squadron, which sailed from Shanghai to the Yangtze River on the 16th, returned to Shanghai and berthed at 6:30 yesterday.</p>
<h3>Exemption of Fees for Private Cars on the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai-Nanjing Highways</h3>
<p>The National Economic Council has sent a letter to the provinces, ordering them to comply with the National Economic Council Preparatory Office's proposal to exempt fees for private cars on the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui highways. The letter has been sent to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provincial governments, ordering them to comply. The original letter states: "Regarding the letter from the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shanghai, and Nanjing Transportation Committee, the meeting of the Third Standing Committee of the council discussed and resolved cases 1-5 and temporary proposal 1 together. Article 2 of the resolution states that the National Economic Council should send a letter to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provincial governments, ordering them to instruct their subordinates that no transit fees should be charged on public or private railways for private cars, including passenger cars, in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of the Provisional Regulations, and so on. This is hereby communicated. Please investigate and handle this matter, and instruct your subordinates to comply." It is now reported that the three provincial governments, after receiving the letter, have already separately ordered the county magistrates and fourteen long-distance automobile companies, including Jiangnan, to comply with the regulations.</p>
<h3>Wenhua Seeks Pictures and Texts on the Northeast Battle Achievements</h3>
<p>The Wenhua Fine Arts and Book Company, in commemoration of the Battle of Shanghai, previously published a large illustrated history of the Battle of Shanghai against Japan. Since its publication and distribution, it has been praised for its rich materials and solid quality, and almost everyone has a copy. In order to enable the public to understand the truth of the war and commemorate the course of the bloody battle, the company set the price extremely low, because it did not want to take the opportunity to profit from the painful war. Now, the company will publish a "Picture History of Blood and Tears of the Great Changes in the Northeast." Yesterday, it sent a special letter to all sectors, widely seeking pictures and texts about the bloody battle in the Northeast. The letter said, "The Japanese invaders have disturbed our borders with their ambition of aggression and launched fierce battles. The catastrophe of September 18th originated in the Northeast, and the wounds of January 28th reappeared in Shanghai. Finally, they captured Rehe and disturbed Tianjin and Beijing. The world was shocked, and the gods and people were outraged. In the Battle of Shanghai, our company could preserve the true traces of blood and tears and create a reliable history of the war. We also followed the generals and soldiers of the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army to photograph and record the battle situation. Then, we published a large illustrated history of the Battle of Shanghai, which was praised by all sectors of society. It is a muddy claw of national disaster, and it is enough to awaken the national soul. However, the Northeast is the first area where the disaster occurred, and it has been suffering until now. For a long time, countless patriotic heroes have shed their blood there, and the groans of our compatriots under the hooves of the violent sun are like stepping on water and fire. Its people and its events can be sobbed and sung, and without a tragic photo, who knows the pain of national disaster? Although the news has spread and the descriptions in the workshops are numerous, it is difficult to see the whole picture, and a comprehensive special publication is not available. Therefore, our company plans to write down the personnel in the Northeast, the blood and tears after September 18th, and the farce of the puppet state of Manchuria, and include them in a book with pictures and texts, which is called the Large Illustrated History of Blood and Tears of the Great Changes in the Northeast. However, our colleagues are based in Shanghai, and our knowledge is limited. We are afraid that we will fail to do this important task. We have always admired you comrades who led the iron army and have conquered stubborn enemies on the battlefield, or have planned strategies and built special merits in the military tent, or have participated in the war because of consolation, or have observed because of investigation. You must have excellent articles that can be called a true record of credible history. Whether it is a war map, a record, a photo, or a table, all those related to the Northeast Incident are welcome. We also ask you to attach an explanation of the facts related to this picture and send it together, which will be even more grateful. If you do not abandon the humble and favor us with ink treasure, or write a title or a preface, we pray that you will send it to us to illuminate the plan. Once the printing is completed and the whole book is published, we will present a copy to you to show our appreciation. This matter concerns the history and can be passed down for a long time. We hope that you will support and be optimistic about its success. Sincerely, we respectfully greet you and await your reply."</p>

<h3>The Yangtze River Water Level Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local Flood Relief Association received a telegram stating that the river water had reached 43 feet. For days, the Yangtze River has experienced continuous rain, causing the water level to rise sharply. Shanghai has also experienced cold weather and intermittent rain since the beginning of this week. Since the night before last, the rain has been incessant, causing water accumulation in low-lying areas. A reporter interviewed Zhu Yong, the chief of the Works Section of the National Government Flood Relief Committee. According to reports from Hankou Jianghan Bureau, the water level has reached 42 feet 3 inches. However, due to the continuous rain, the water level is still rising. Today (yesterday), a report was received stating that the water level has risen several inches again, reaching 43 feet 1 inch, and the rain has not stopped. When asked if the Flood Relief Association has any preventive measures for such a rapid rise in water, he replied that Xi Dejiong has been sent to inspect everything along the river and will actively handle it locally. The association has not yet received a report. (Guowenshe)</p>
<h3>Chen Baosheng, Defendant in the Xinrenhe Tragedy, Arrested</h3>
<p>The case of Chen being arrested while visiting his sick wife, and the request to release him on bail being denied due to Ding's serious illness. The Xinrenhe steamship murder case of peddlers Ma Koubao and four others has been investigated by the Shanghai District Court, prosecuted, and is awaiting sentencing. The support association for the case suddenly received a tip that a floating corpse was found in the sea near Baoshan. After examination by the association's committee members, it was confirmed to be the victim Wei Jincheng. Yesterday morning, they led the family members of the deceased and witnesses to the Baoshan County Government to request the opening of the coffin for identification. However, in addition to the ship owner Sun Xingsheng and others who have been interrogated, the principal offenders Wang Guanxian, the associate, Chen Baosheng, the deputy buyer, Zhu Shunlin, the chief mate, and Jiang Chen Yinglong, the first mate, are still at large. Although the authorities have ordered their arrest, they have not yet been captured. It is reported that Chen Baosheng fled immediately after the incident. Due to the strict pursuit by the authorities, his whereabouts were uncertain. He also sent his wife, Ding, to live with his relative Teng Maobin in Huaxingli, Xinmin Road, Zhabei, to avoid attracting the attention of the police and being arrested. However, she has been suffering from severe fevers recently and has been treated by doctors repeatedly, but without effect. Chen, although escaped elsewhere, was very anxious after learning that his wife was ill. At around 7:00 PM the night before last, he rushed to Teng's house to visit his wife, Ding. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Investigation Team received a tip-off about the situation. The team leader secretly dispatched a large number of detectives to Teng's house in Huaxingli, Xinmin Road, Zhabei, and arrested Chen Baosheng, along with his wife, Ding, and Teng Maobin and Teng's family members, and brought them back to the team for interrogation. Afterwards, Chen's relatives sent people to the Investigation Team to request that Ding be released on bail for medical treatment, as she was seriously ill. However, the team leader considered the case to be extremely important and refused to release her on bail. Therefore, as of this morning, Chen and his wife are still being held at the team and have not yet been transferred to the Shanghai District Court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Shooting on Tianbao Road, Zhabei, The Victim Wounded</h3>
<p>Fang Qingfa suffered two gunshot wounds, his large intestine was injured, and there is fear of death. Fang Wanxin Tobacco and Paper Shop, located at No. 292 Tianbao Road, Zhabei, is owned by Fang Qingfa, a native of Ningbo, who is 37 years old. At around 4:30 PM yesterday, Fang and his mother were chatting in the store when three robbers suddenly broke in. They were wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants. One robber with a gun was guarding the door, and two unarmed robbers walked into the store. Seeing a gold ring on Fang's mother's hand, they stepped forward to rob it. Fang's mother saw that the two robbers were unarmed and fought with the two robbers regardless of everything, but she was ultimately defeated and the ring was taken away. The two robbers then ran into the accounting room, intending to rob the money in the counter. Seeing this, Fang Qingfa ran to the back door, hoping to report to the police station. However, the robber guarding the door saw this and called out to the two unarmed robbers, who ran out of the store and chased Fang together. Seeing that Fang had run out of the back door and was standing in the lane shouting for help, the robber became anxious, pulled out his pistol, and fired at Fang, a total of six shots. Two shots hit Fang's vital parts, and he immediately fell to the ground, lying in a pool of blood. The robbers saw that things were not good and fled in different directions. When the patrol police from the Third Precinct of the Fifth District heard the alarm and arrived, they had already fled far away. They quickly sent Fang to Tongren Hospital for treatment and reported to the station, dispatched detectives to investigate the scene of the incident, searched in different directions, and Fang, after being sent to the hospital, was examined by the hospital's doctors, who found two gunshot wounds. One bullet penetrated the right leg, and the femur was broken. One bullet entered through the lower abdomen and exited backward, fearing that it had injured the large intestine. Therefore, it still needs to be cut, and his life is in danger, and there is fear of death. The victim's side, as a result, only had a gold ring robbed by the robbers.</p>
<h3>Merchants in the Extra-Boundary Road Construction Section of North Sichuan Road Petitioned Yesterday for the Suspension of House Tax</h3>
<p>Release the arrested Jin Jusheng and others. Merchants in the extra-boundary road construction section of North Sichuan Road, due to refusing to pay house tax, had disputes with the Fifth District Second Precinct in charge. The four people, including Jin Jusheng, were arrested the day before yesterday. The merchants there were indignant and gathered more than 130 people to petition the municipal government and the municipal party department yesterday. The various situations are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Past Situation</h3>
<p>It is reported that there were more than 600 municipal houses in the area. Due to the impact of the January 28th Incident, some were destroyed by artillery fire, and some moved to other places. Now there are only more than 200 houses left. Previously, the merchants in the area had petitioned the municipal government twice, requesting to postpone the collection of house tax and to provide relief. However, the authorities did not grant the request due to the shortage of municipal funds. Therefore, the merchants submitted petitions to the National Government and the Executive Yuan, requesting that the municipal government be instructed to postpone the collection. However, no approval has been received yet.</p>
<h3>Petition Process</h3>
<p>Since the dispute occurred, the general merchants elected Li Zifeng, Hu Changyong, Hu Zhaoying, Xie Xiazun, Ye Qichang, Guan Jichuan, Zhong Peishen, and other twelve people as representatives to go to the Municipal Government in Fenglinqiao to petition in the rain at 11:00 AM yesterday, putting forward three requests: (1) Release the arrested merchants; (2) Postpone the collection of house tax; (3) Guarantee that such unfortunate incidents will not occur again before the entire problem is resolved. The Municipal Government sent Yuan Shenglü, a staff member of the Second Section, to receive them. Mr. Yuan accepted the three requests and promised to ask the mayor for instructions.</p>
<h3>Satisfactory Result</h3>
<p>At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the representatives were answered that the first request would be released by the Public Security Bureau, the second request would be submitted to the municipal conference for discussion, and the third request would be completely accepted.</p>
<p>The representatives considered the result satisfactory and left, and then went to the Municipal Party Department on Linyin Road to petition.</p>
<h3>The Regulations for the Mixed Reporting and Loading of LTL Cargoes Have Been Revised for the Two Railways</h3>
<p>The traffic departments of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways issued a notice to the stationmasters yesterday, stating that the regulations for the mixed reporting and loading of LTL (Less Than Truckload) cargoes are slightly different between the two railways. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line has regulations for receiving and transporting goods separately, while the Shanghai-Nanjing line does not have this provision, causing discrepancies between the two lines. In order to unify the regulations of the two railways, the lower half of Section 11 of Article 2 of the Rules has been canceled. In the future, the loading of LTL cargoes at all stations on the two railways will be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 23 of the General Regulations for Railway Freight Transportation (if each batch or piece of cargo contains two or more grades of goods and is loaded in mixed form, the freight for the total weight shall be calculated according to the freight rate of the highest grade of goods). However, if the goods have special prices, their grade is low, and their price rate is high, the highest freight rate shall be calculated. Please check accordingly.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Industry Actively Prepares to Establish an Alcohol Factory</h3>
<p>The capital is set at 1 million yuan, jointly operated by the government and businessmen, and the factory site is decided to be in Shanghai, which will soon be realized. The Ministry of Industry, in view of the fact that the alcohol used in China is supplied by imported goods, and that a huge amount of profits are lost every year, is now preparing to establish an alcohol factory in cooperation with overseas Chinese Huang Jiangquan and Zhao Jinqing, the general manager of the local Tongyi Bank, in order to recover the rights and interests. The capital is planned to be 1 million yuan of national currency, and the factory site is located in Shanghai. All the progress plans are roughly drafted. The following is a record of the various situations obtained by the Xin Xin She (New News Agency) reporter.</p>
<h3>Motivation for Establishment</h3>
<p>When Zhao Jinqing was the Deputy Minister of Industry, he saw that the number of alcohol needed in various places such as domestic industry, medicine, chemistry, and family was very large, and it was all supplied by foreign countries. According to the Jianghai Customs investigation in the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the alcohol imported after tax payment every year has been about 5 million gallons. In addition, there are private smuggled and tax-evaded alcohol, which shows that the number of alcohol needed in China every year is really alarming. In view of this, Zhao prepared to establish a state-run alcohol factory to recover the rights and interests. Later, due to the slight change in the political situation, Zhao resigned, and the matter was shelved.</p>
<h3>A Countryman Encounter Turns into a Grand Swindle in a Foreign Land</h3>
<p>Goose-eye small coins used as gambling tools, a stack of blank paper used as banknotes. Gao Shaoji and Wang Hancai, natives of Fujian, came to Shanghai by ship from Xiamen this time, seeking employment. One day, they were idly strolling on Nanjing Road when Pan Ying (also known as Lin Yuzhao), a Fujianese man who had previously been convicted of fraud and sentenced to eight years of imprisonment, and Xue Ziguan, also happened to be passing by. Hearing Gao and Wang speaking in the Fujian dialect, they knew they were fellow villagers and approached them, expressing extreme cordiality. Gao and others were overjoyed to meet fellow villagers in a foreign land. They were invited to Room 637 of the Xin Xin Hotel on Nanjing Road. At that time, there were also Xue Zhennan, Wang Zhengshan, Luo Ying, and Li Zi'an, all from Fujian, in the room. Meeting each other, they were exceptionally intimate. After chatting for a while, someone suggested playing a gambling game, inviting Gao and Wang to join. Wang declined due to his dislike of gambling, but Gao, who was fond of it, gladly participated. Xue Ziguan and his accomplices, Wang, Luo, and Li, then gambled with Gao, using goose-eye small coins as gambling tools. They also used a piece of blank paper, writing the numbers one, two, three, and four on it. The dealer would secretly hold the coins in his hand, and the gamblers would freely guess the number of coins in his hand. If they guessed three, they would bet under the number three. The dealer would wait until everyone had placed their bets before opening his hand, allowing the bettors to count carefully. However, because the dealer was cheating, the money in his hand was not counted by others, but by himself. Therefore, those who placed heavy bets never guessed correctly. Gao Shaoji lost heavily, emptying his pockets. He even pawned his long gown as collateral, but it was still not enough. He had to borrow seventy-seven yuan from his companion, Wang Hancai, to pay Xue and his gang before the game ended. In total, Gao lost as much as one hundred and fifty-five yuan. Afterwards, he realized that Xue and his gang must be swindlers, so he reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station, which dispatched detective Zhao Ziren to investigate and arrest them at the hotel. Unexpectedly, these people were as cunning as rabbits with three burrows, and had already moved into Room 604, hiding and disappearing. But they were eventually arrested, and four leather suitcases and two bamboo baskets were found, all empty. In addition, more than a dozen stacks of blank paper resembling banknotes were also found. Each stack had a worthless provincial banknote on top. These items were all used to deceive simple-minded fellow villagers during gambling. Detective Zhao immediately took the suspects and witnesses to the Lao Zha Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Liu Yugui conducted the preliminary hearing. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the case, requesting that they be prosecuted for fraud. The defendants hired lawyer Fan Gang for their defense. Judge Liu questioned each defendant and ordered them to be detained pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Over 130,000 Yuan Robbery Case Solved in Jiaxing, Two Criminals Arrested</h3>
<p>The case of Zhao Zhangyun, a Wenzhou native working as a ship greeter at the Qianji Hotel on Fuzhou Road, who was robbed of a huge sum of money on the morning of the 16th while carrying funds for various Wenzhou banks to Shanghai on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Guangji ship, in Yong'an Street in the French Concession, has been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that detectives Jin Jiulin, Zhang Zikan, Zhou Yaoting, Bao Tan Qinyouyu, and Cui Zhendong of the French Police apprehended the robbers Wang Maonv and his mistress Xu Wangshi the following morning. Five hundred yuan of the stolen money was found on Wang's person, and seven thousand one hundred yuan was found in Xu's room. It is now learned that on the same day, the detectives continued to arrest Yong Yu Zhang Yushi (the mother of robber Zhang Weicai) at 335 Broadway Road, seizing fifty yuan in stolen money and a yellow paper package from the Wenzhou Yuan Kang Bank. Huang Baisheng, a native of Haimen, was also arrested at Wang Maonv's home and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the police escorted the robbers to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Wang Wangxu presided over the hearing. First, police representative lawyer Yuan Jiahong presented the case, stating that the defendants were arrested for robbery, the police had not yet begun the investigation, and some accomplices were still at large. He requested that the defendants be detained and the case be investigated further before being brought to trial in three weeks. Then, Bao Tan Qinyouyu reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants, and presented the stolen money, a bundle of banknotes, and a bamboo basket as evidence. According to the victim Zhao Zhangyun, who worked as a ship greeter at the Qianji Hotel, he was carrying 126,000 yuan in cash from thirty-one Wenzhou banks, including Houkang, to Shanghai banks. The banknotes were mostly from the Bank of China, Central Bank, and Zhongnan Bank, mostly five-yuan notes, followed by ten-yuan notes, packed in a leather suitcase. He hired a rickshaw at the dock to transport them back to the hotel. When they reached the front of Butterfield &amp; Swire, they were forced into Yong'an Street by robbers. At the entrance of Yong'an Lane, three people dragged him into the alley, held a gun to him, and two others snatched the suitcase from the rickshaw. He identified Wang Maonv as the robber who held the gun to him. According to witness Cui San, 35 years old, from Tongzhou, who worked as a rickshaw puller, he knew the victim. He was asked to push the luggage for six jiao. He pushed the rickshaw to the front of Butterfield &amp; Swire on the Bund, where the robbers stopped him, prevented him from moving forward, and ordered him to turn into Yong'an Street. He refused and was slapped in the face, causing him to bleed. He refused to turn and was punched and kicked. They took out a gun to scare him, and he was forced to turn into Yong'an Street. At the entrance of the alley, they forced him to stop, pulled the victim into the alley, and snatched the suitcase from the rickshaw. The judge asked if the robber's faces were recognizable. Cui examined the faces of Wang and Huang and replied that he was too scared at the time to see clearly. At this point, the judge ordered the defendants to be taken down for separate questioning. First, Xu Wangshi testified that her husband was Xu Amao, and she had been having an affair with Wang Maonv for over a year. The 7,100 yuan found in her home was brought by Maonv in the morning. She was sleeping in bed and asked him what it was. He said to leave it alone and not touch it. He and several others went to rob, and she did not know. He also did not tell her about it. Wang Maonv testified that the day before the ship arrived, four people at the dock told Li Along (aka Scarface Along) that there was opium. Along told Zhang Weicai, who told him to go rob. Later, Li Along, Zhang Weicai, Atu, Abao, Aqing, Da Luosong, and himself, a total of seven people, went to rob the suitcase. Zhang Weicai took the suitcase and told him to go to the Grand Shanghai Hotel to divide the money. When he arrived at the Grand Shanghai, Zhang Weicai told him that there were only over 30,000 yuan in banknotes and gave him 8,000 yuan. He said that he heard there was over 100,000 yuan. Zhang Weicai hit him and said that he should only care about having money to spend. After being persuaded, he sent the money to his mistress Xu Wangshi's home at 1292 Xinji Bang Road, wrapped in newspaper, and told her not to touch it. He was arrested that night. Huang Baisheng, 34 years old, testified that he worked at the Xingji Coffin Company, which specialized in transporting coffins. That day, he was ordered by someone from the company to go to Xu Wangshi's home to ask Wang Maonv to go to the company to settle the account. He was arrested and did not know about the robbery. Zhang Yushi, 58 years old, testified that Zhang Weicai was her son, and he and his wife were living separately. The banknotes that were found were sent by her daughter-in-law through someone, transferred by the second landlord, a total of 60 yuan. She knew nothing about the robbery. At this point, the court ordered the hearing to be adjourned to 10:00 AM on July 8, and the defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<p>In addition, it was learned that at the Lao Jiafu Silk Store on Wangwu Bridge in the northern city of Jiaxing, on the afternoon of the 18th, two customers arrived, acting suspiciously. They purchased over 80 yuan worth of silk and paid quickly, raising the suspicion of the store clerk. After discovering the location of the two men's residence, he reported it to the voluntary defense corps. At about 2:00 AM on the 19th, members of the defense corps, together with police officers assigned by the Guanyinge Police Station, searched Room 35 of the Dadong Hotel and seized 835 yuan in banknotes, many with the words "Zhejiang Wenzhou" on them. When asked the names of the two men, they claimed to be Zhang Runsheng and Li Rongsheng (aka Scarface Along). They hesitated about the rest of the information, so it was recognized that they were the robbers from the Yong'an Street robbery in Shanghai and were immediately taken to the County Public Security Bureau for detention. Shanghai detective agencies were notified to take them to Shanghai for questioning.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Plan</h3>
<p>After Chen Gongbo succeeded as Minister of Industry, he reviewed previous cases and learned that this matter had been planned to a considerable extent. Therefore, he consulted with Zhao several times and continued to handle it. As a result, it was decided to start on a small scale first. The original capital was set at 250,000 yuan, with the government owning two-fifths and private investors owning three-fifths. Zhao was responsible for raising the 150,000 yuan of private investment. The 100,000 yuan of government investment was to be borrowed from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board to be used for government shares because of treasury deficits. This undertaking was successfully negotiated.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Scale</h3>
<p>Later, Huang Jiangquan, an overseas Chinese who ran a sugar factory in Java, learned that China was going to establish an alcohol factory and was very pleased because the bagasse from his sugar factory could be used as raw material for alcohol. If he could invest and cooperate, it would be a win-win situation. Therefore, he immediately traveled to Shanghai and Beijing to contact Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo and Zhao Jinqing, expressing his willingness to invest in private shares. At the same time, he also proposed to expand the scale of the factory, increasing the planned capital from 250,000 yuan to 1 million yuan, so that the output could meet the needs of the entire country in the future.</p>
<h3>Factory to be Located in Shanghai</h3>
<p>In the future, the factory will be located in Shanghai. According to the original plan (for a capital of 250,000 yuan), it can produce 1,000 gallons of alcohol per day, totaling 3.6 million gallons per year. However, compared with the 5 million gallons imported annually according to customs reports, there is still a shortage of 1.4 million gallons. In addition, the domestic demand for alcohol is increasing year by year. Therefore, the authorities attach great importance to this matter, deeply believing that the realization of this factory will not only restore some of the lost interests but also be a good opportunity for China's production industry.</p>
<h3>Government Guarantee</h3>
<p>Regarding the expansion of the factory, it is said that overseas Chinese Huang Jiangquan is currently in Beijing to negotiate everything with Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo. Once a decision is made, preparations can begin. According to some opinions, the extent of the factory's expansion and the amount of capital are not a problem. The most important reasons are the following two points: (1) taxes and (2) labor unrest. If the authorities can provide adequate guarantees in advance, private investors will naturally be happy to invest. The so-called expansion of scale will certainly be easy.</p>
<h3>Future Sales</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency specially visited Zhao Jinqing yesterday to inquire about the current progress. Zhao replied, "The entire progress plan of the factory has been roughly drafted. After Huang comes to Shanghai again to negotiate, a decision can be made and preparations can begin. Furthermore, most of the private investors that I have recruited are from the industrial, commercial, and medical fields, because these people have close relationships with the factory.

<h3>Inauguration of All Members of the Overseas Chinese Federation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation, after receiving an order from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the National Government to prepare for re-election, held elections for members in Shanghai on May 29 after several months of preparation. However, many of the elected members were not in Shanghai, so the inauguration could not be held immediately. It was not until 2:00 PM yesterday that the new executive and supervisory members held the inauguration ceremony for all members in Shanghai in the main hall on the second floor of the association. The first executive committee was also held to elect the chairman, vice-chairman, secretary-general, and deputy secretary-general. At that time, the party and national flags were intertwined in front of the association, the decorations were quite elegant and solemn. Over twenty people attended, including Mao Yun, a representative of the municipal party headquarters, and the newly elected executive and supervisory members Chen Wulie, Xu Jigong, Zhang Yongfu, Huang Jianzhong, Qiu Hanping, Li Denghui, Qiu Zansheng, Wu Yingpei, Cui Tongyue, Zhang Chuming, Chen Minzhi, Ye Daoyuan, Xu Zhiyun, Xie Nanguang, Dai Shaoqiao, Wu Yuwen, and about fifty guests and observers. The chairman was Xu Jigong, and the recorder was Yao Zhenlong. The ceremony was performed as usual. First, the chairman reported on the association's affairs, earnestly saying, "I deeply hope that the new executive and supervisory members will work hard, take responsibility, and reorganize the association's affairs, so that the suffering of overseas Chinese can be alleviated and the construction of the country can be brightened. This is my great hope." Then, the music was played, and the new executive and supervisory members took the oath of office amidst the melodious music. After the ceremony, Mao Yun, a representative of the municipal party headquarters, gave a speech, saying, "All of you members are revolutionary pioneers and have made great contributions to the party and the country. I hope that you will use your past revolutionary spirit to reorganize the association's affairs, so that the foundation of the association's affairs can be consolidated, and the suffering of overseas Chinese can also be alleviated. Not only that, but the construction of the country can also rely on the assistance of overseas Chinese to proceed." Finally, the first meeting of the executive committee was held, and Chen Wulie, Xu Jigong, Huang Jianzhong, Qiu Hanping, Qiu Zansheng, Wu Yingpei, and Cui Tongyue were elected as standing committee members. Then, the chairman and vice-chairman were re-elected. All the members unanimously recommended Xu Jigong to continue as chairman. However, Xu Jigong firmly declined, saying that he was old and weak, eager to rest, and had already advanced over ten thousand yuan to the association's finances since the January 28 Incident. If he were to take the position of chairman again, he would not be able to do so. After much earnest persuasion, he finally agreed to take the position of vice-chairman, and Chen Wulie was unanimously recommended to be the chairman. Huang Jianzhong was unanimously recommended to be the secretary-general, and Qiu Zansheng was the deputy secretary-general. Since Xu Jigong took over as the fourth chairman of the association, he has tried his best to expand the association's affairs. In addition to handling all matters for overseas Chinese, he has established the Overseas Chinese Ten-Day Publication in Shanghai, organized the Overseas Chinese Federation Telegraph Agency, and established the Overseas Chinese Federation Hospital for medical treatment and free medicine, which can be said to be fulfilling his responsibilities. Yesterday, the association dispersed after taking photos, and it was already after 6:00 PM. It is said that the association will soon notify overseas groups.</p>

<h3>Tang Jiapeng's Corpse Examined and Funeral Held</h3>
<p>Wu Guangcai Examined Together</p>
<p>Funeral Held on the 21st</p>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, the Yong manager of the Great World, was assassinated and shot dead in front of the Great World at 1:20 AM the day before yesterday. At the same time, a pedestrian named Wu Guangcai was killed by a stray bullet. The police sent the corpses to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The corpse of Wu was identified by his cousin Feng Wu (28 years old, residing at the Shendechang Laceware Store on Xiaoshadu Road) and the deceased's nephew Wu Bicheng (19 years old) at the corpse examination site. Yesterday, Chen Beisan, Chief Prosecutor of the Second Special District Court Procuratorate, together with forensic doctor Wei Ligong and clerk Peng Yi, arrived at the site for examination at half past morning. Tang's corpse was tall and strong. Due to the head injuries, it was swollen like a gourd. The abdomen was bulging and the face was covered with blood, making it a terrible sight. After the forensic doctor examined the gunshot wounds, Wu's corpse was also examined. The judge ascended the official desk. First, Bao Tan Wang Licheng reported the results of the investigation. Then, Tang's driver Xu Arong testified that he had been with Tang for more than seven years. Before the incident, he was in the car and saw his master coming out of the Great World gate with three or five friends. He immediately started the engine and turned on the headlights, waiting for him to get in the car. He heard him say to his friends, "Are you going to Caohejing tomorrow?" The friends replied, "Yes." He said, "A little earlier." After speaking, he nodded goodbye to his friends. Just as he stepped on the car's running board, he suddenly heard gunshots and bullets flying past him. He turned around and saw his master squatting down instead of getting in the car. He immediately pulled him into the car and saw blood on him, knowing that he had been shot. He immediately sent him to Baolong Hospital, but he died before he could be treated. He was too scared at the time to clearly see the faces of the murderers. Then, Tang's wife, Tang Li, said that the deceased was her husband and was the manager of the Great World. He was shot and killed. She was at home and only found out after someone came to tell her. She did not know what grievances he had with others. He had never told her. Now that he has suffered a tragic death, she asks that the murderer be apprehended and justice be done. Finally, Wu's family gave their statements. The judge declared that Tang Jiapeng and Wu Guangcai had died from gunshot wounds before death. Tang's corpse was handed over to his wife, Tang Li, and Wu's corpse was handed over to Feng Wu and Wu Bicheng. The police were ordered to apprehend the murderer and bring him to trial. After the examination, Tang's corpse was carried to the China Funeral Parlor on Haige Road by his family. He was coffined at 1:00 PM that afternoon, and the funeral was scheduled for the 21st. The expenses for Wu's clothes, coffin, and other items were paid by the Tang family and given to his family for encoffinment.</p>
<h3>Traveler from Shenzhou Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>At the Shenzhou Hotel on Simalu, Zhejiang Road, around 12:00 AM the night before (the 18th), a young man arrived wearing a plain dark-colored long gown and leather shoes, carrying an umbrella, likely due to the continuous rainy season. The porter led him to room 343 on the third floor. He claimed to be a local named Zhang Huimin, 26 years old, in the tobacco leaf business. The next morning, around 4:00 AM, he rang the bell once and told the porter that he was exhausted and needed a good sleep, asking to be called around 1:30 PM. The porter acknowledged and left. Around 1:45 PM, as agreed, the porter knocked on the door but received no response. Feeling something was amiss, he reported to the front desk, who arranged for the door to be forced open. Zhang was found lying on the bed, his face pale, with white foam coming from his mouth, already dead. The front desk immediately reported to the Old Zhabei Police Station, who sent officer number 164 to transport the body to Renji Hospital, then to the morgue for examination. The doctor diagnosed that the deceased had taken a large dose of sedative. The reason for the death was said to be possibly due to financial difficulties, but this was not confirmed.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Zhang Tragically Crushed to Death by Car</h3>
<p>The Chauffeur Appears to Be at Fault. Mrs. Zhang, 46 years old, was crossing Dixiwei Road from south to north on the morning of the day before yesterday when a car, number 5473, driven by Chen Weixin, sped from the west. Unable to avoid her, the car struck her and ran over her chest, killing her instantly. After the accident, the car continued forward, hitting a rickshaw parked nearby. The incident occurred near the Chinese area and was witnessed by a police officer, number 3316, on duty from the third section of the fifth district, who stopped the car. The Jiading Road Police Station was notified and sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Feilun Road morgue, and the driver was taken into custody. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhan Liangce from the First Special District Court was dispatched to examine the body and conduct a public inquiry. Wang Ye testified that he was a police officer in the Chinese area and was on duty when he saw the deceased being hit. The car did not stop, so he blew his whistle and shouted for it to stop. He saw that the woman had already died. Shen Muqing testified that he was a rickshaw puller. He was pulling his rickshaw on Dixiwei Road near Oujia Road when a truck came from behind and hit him. He then saw that the woman had been killed. Chen Weixin testified that he had been driving for eleven years. The deceased had already crossed in front of his car, but when she saw another car coming, she stepped back. His car was carrying over two thousand pounds of sand, making it difficult to brake in time, resulting in the accident. Prosecutor Zhan concluded that Mrs. Zhang had died from being crushed in the chest by truck number 5473. The body was released to her husband, Yu Guangqi, for burial. The driver, Chen Weixin, appeared to be at fault and was to be handed over to the court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhao Ma’s Case Against Yang Zhigang Dismissed</h3>
<p>Yang Countersues for False Accusation. Zhao Ma, 28 years old, from Pudong, is the wife of Zhao Liansheng, a steward on the Changjiang Jihe steamer, who died many years ago. Through an introduction, she met Yang Zhigang, and they rented a room upstairs at the Tianran Pond in the Gongyu Li on Taopeng Road. A waiter named Xiao Wang had borrowed 200 yuan from Yang Zhigang, and a chiropodist named Wang Tingzhi had borrowed 500 yuan. Yang used the interest from these loans to cover Zhao Ma's monthly living expenses and bought her clothes, jewelry, and other items, totaling over 300 yuan. Soon, Zhao Ma discovered Yang Zhigang's private savings. On the fourth day of the first lunar month this year, Yang had a gold pocket watch that Zhao Ma took. When Yang asked for it back, she claimed she had lost it gambling. When Yang pressed her further, she said it was stolen. Yang was suspicious. Zhao Ma then hired lawyer Yang Shaopeng to sue Yang Zhigang for offenses against morality. After a court hearing, her lawsuit was dismissed. Yang Zhigang then hired lawyer Yao Jiapeng to sue Zhao Ma for false accusation and defamation.</p>
<h3>Coveting a Large Sum of Money</h3>

<h3>Synopsis of Soviet Women's Lives from the Shenbao Series</h3>
<p>Compiled by Ms. Fan Ying, duodecimo format, 52 pages, actual price 20 cents, paper cover 3.</p>
<p>The main points of this book can be summarized as follows: First, Soviet women are absolutely equal to men. Although the principle of equality between men and women has been recognized by all countries in principle today, there are still many differences in practice. For example, in a family, women usually obey men, and men are the center of the family. Women's status is generally regarded as merely an appendage of men, and it is believed that women should only devote themselves to family work and should not participate in social activities. In law and politics, women are also subject to restrictions everywhere and cannot fully develop their abilities. In the Soviet Union, the opposite is completely true. Soviet women can now be said to have absolute freedom, and they are no longer subject to unreasonable restrictions in any way. Like men, they actively participate in work and social activities. They are no longer housewives bound in a family, but a lively "social person." Second, Soviet women are economically independent. We know that the biggest reason for the inequality between men and women is that women cannot be economically independent. Soviet women are able to obtain complete freedom because they are economically independent. Like men, Soviet women are now engaged in occupations. According to statistics for the first half of 1932, women accounted for an average of 55.4% of primary and secondary school teachers in the Soviet Union, more than 20% of court judges, and 72.6% of female doctors; in terms of industrial labor, there were more than 6.5 million women in the Soviet Union. This shows the economic liberation of Soviet women and the development of their abilities. Third, marriage is absolutely free. In the Soviet Union, marriage and divorce are absolutely free. The marriage ceremony is very simple, just register at the registry. Divorce is the same, you don't have to get the other party's consent, you can divorce if you want. Marriage is very common in the Soviet Union, and it is not considered a "lifelong matter." Love is also completely free in the Soviet Union. They have no etiquette defenses at all, but the morals of the Soviet Union are very good. There has never been any "rape" or "enticement of minors," unlike our country, which boasts of etiquette on the one hand, and on the other hand, news of "rape" and "enticement" fills our ears. "Love is no longer seen as a status of breaking money in the Soviet Union, because Soviet women can mostly support themselves, and money and status are not important to them." "Depression and suicide due to heartbreak are completely unheard of in the Soviet Union." Because "their outlook on life is to strive to participate in the construction of the future society, to participate in all social activities, and to see love between men and women as just one of the entertainment activities after work." Fourth, the level of education has been improved. In the past, 90% of Soviet women were illiterate, but now they all have the opportunity to be educated. Like male students, Soviet female students' expenses from elementary school to university are completely borne by the state. After going to university, the state also subsidizes living expenses. In addition, there are female workers' training classes, which are very complete. There are now many female engineers and inventors in the Soviet Union who have graduated from this type of training class. At first, they were all illiterate. Therefore, in the Soviet Union, everyone has the opportunity to develop their abilities equally, and there will never be a difference between having money and not having money, so that only a few people can be educated and most people cannot be educated. Fifth, women actively participate in social activities. Soviet women are very enthusiastic about politics and all social activities. In European and American countries, there may be a few outstanding upper-class women who participate in politics, while in the Soviet Union, tens of thousands of women participate widely. The ability they demonstrate in politics is no weaker than that of men. They have made a great contribution to the success of the First Five-Year Plan. "The women's movement in other countries is still aimed at striving for the complete liberation of women themselves in politics and law, while the current goal of the women's movement in the Soviet Union is how to realize the benefits that women have already obtained." This can now be said to have been realized in the Soviet Union. The above five points are the main items described in this book. From this, we can have a clear impression of Soviet women's lives. It tells us how happy Soviet women are and how they are liberated from the family to become "social people." But we must not forget that their happiness has been achieved through hard struggle. Therefore, the first sentence of the book says: "The reason why Soviet women's lives can shine uniquely in the women's circles of various countries in the world today is all thanks to the "October Revolution" in 1917!" This is the point we must pay the most attention to. The author, Ms. Fan Ying, studied in Moscow for many years and traveled all over the important places in the Soviet Union. All of her descriptions are accurate and well-founded. The language of the whole book is also clear and simple. Anyone who is concerned about women's issues, especially those who hope to find a solution to the current problem of Chinese women's future, will surely be given a lot of rich information after reading this book. Eight selected pictures are attached at the beginning.</p>

<h3>Consignment of Goods</h3>
<p>— Yang Yu-sheng</p>
<p>In illustrated magazines, one often sees Gandhi spinning yarn with his bare torso exposed. It is said that he refuses to wear British cloth, preferring to go shirtless; he wants to wear homespun cloth, so he spins yarn. He is so dedicated to spinning yarn that he even brought a simple spinning wheel with him to London to attend the Round Table Conference. People call him strange, but I admire his courage.</p>
<p>Gandhi is a citizen of a fallen nation, and compared to us Chinese, he seems less free. However, Britain has not forced him to wear British cloth, nor has it forbidden him from bringing a spinning wheel. Is it because Gandhi's sincerity is so compelling, or is it because Britain relies on its magnanimity? Let's put that aside for now. But even though India has been conquered, its people's "freedom of dress" has not been completely taken away, which seems certain. China is practically a semi-colony, but nominally still bears the signboard of an independent country. People wear goods from the East and stride proudly down the street, and Japanese goods are piled high in every home. Yet Japan still claims that the Chinese are organizing to boycott their goods, violating international principles, and even taking the case across the Pacific, insisting on forcing every Chinese person to buy Japanese goods. What kind of world is this!</p>
<p>I have money, you have goods, whether I buy them or not is up to me; whether I like them or not is up to you. Airplanes and cannons are your weapons of intimidation, and I fear you, but business transactions still need to be reasonable. If business transactions are as unreasonable as airplanes and cannons, forcing me to buy your goods, what kind of world is that!</p>
<p>Everyone knows that feces are foul. Everyone knows that arsenic is poisonous. But as long as it is voluntary, eating feces and taking arsenic are not a big deal. If it is not voluntary but someone is forced to eat feces and take arsenic, and they refuse, that is considered a violation of public morality; even though the 20th century is said to be dark, it probably won't be that dark!</p>
<p>In reality, the Japanese can be considered extremely foolish. They can threaten China to ban all boycott organizations, but they cannot threaten every Chinese person to buy Japanese goods. Japan uses goods to earn the Chinese people's money and then manufactures airplanes and cannons to massacre them. Even though the Chinese are said to be weak, they are unwilling to swallow this arsenic. Therefore, in their helpless agony, they came up with the last resort of boycotting goods. This is originally a natural expression of everyone's conscience, with no so-called promotion, and in fact, no need for any organization-like title.</p>
<p>Let's not even talk about whether the Chinese people have absolute and complete freedom to buy Japanese goods or not, and no one is allowed to interfere. Even if we take a step back and admit that not buying Japanese goods is motivated by righteous indignation and is a means of retaliation, but with Chinese territory and people being slaughtered by Japan to this extent, the so-called means of retaliation is limited to the weak and powerless boycott, which is truly pitiful to say. If even this legitimate means of self-defense is to be taken away, then why not just slaughter all 400 million Chinese people and let them run rampant, wouldn't that be thorough and enjoyable!</p>
<p>People only know the suffering of Gandhi leading the Indian people's struggle, but they don't know that there is a nation in the world that is even more constrained than India, and this nation is even more miserable!</p>
<h3>Revival of the Qinhuai</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Brightly lit painted boats, melodious and graceful orchestral music, gentle and charming singing: This is the unique beauty of the Qinhuai River, with its magnificent, luxurious, and extravagant scenes of the Six Dynasties. This beautiful scenery and good times left a very deep impression when the new capital was established in 1927, and even in the early days of the victorious Northern Expedition, it still left behind many romantic stories. However, after the 1920s, the Qinhuai River was affected by the ban on prostitution, and invisibly encountered an unexpected blow. The desolation and loneliness of the past few years, a kind of tragic scene, really made poets and writers sigh endlessly! The enchanting painted boats could not withstand the cold wind and drizzling rain, and did not hesitate to change their appearance and sneak to Xuanwu Lake to make a wandering living; it was as if the descendants of a declining wealthy family were wandering in other places to make a living. "The Qinhuai River is like an aging beauty, her remaining powder and rouge are even more pitiful!" It seems that before the September 18th Incident, there was a poet who mourned the Qinhuai River in this way. Recently, it seems that singing and dancing are to be used to embellish the prosperous age; therefore, the incomplete ban on prostitution has finally been officially decided to be lifted, and no longer turning a deaf ear to it. It is said that the ban will be lifted from July 1st; this trick of untying the bell and striking the bell has not yet been done as required, and the Qinhuai River in front of us has clearly and unscrupulously told us that it has already been "trading in advance."</p>
<p>The green water of the Qinhuai River, under the reflection of the lights, rippled with silky eye waves, conveyed wisps of singing, and emerged graceful couples. The many charming women and the many luxurious young men, after a long period of not being openly indulgent, are now "Qinhuai is full of spring breeze every night." The signs of the revival of Qinhuai are so obvious; however, when will our great nation show signs of revival?</p>
<h3>Interesting History of Snuff</h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>"Snuff," as such a thing, can be regarded as "outdated" in modern society. Its most prosperous time was in the late Qing Dynasty. All princes, ministers, and officials, large and small, regarded snuff as a treasure, and considered sniffing snuff to be extravagant. The snuff bottles used were also very exquisite, and they were all carried around to show that they were figures of a "special class." Therefore, snuff was most rich in "aristocratic color," and of course it was not something that commoners could enjoy. Because it could not be popularized, jokes were made. Now, I will write this humorous story below: to amuse the readers!</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, inland transportation was not very convenient. Water transport relied on "sailing boats." Some towns and villages have not yet disappeared. The most difficult thing to solve on a sailing boat was the "urination problem" for women. It's okay for those who are nearby, but for those who are far away, it's really impossible to urinate. Men can push the awning, pull down their pants, and release a thousand miles. Women, because of physiological reasons, do not have such convenience.</p>
<p>One day, a humorist also took a sailing boat; he suddenly heard the sound of "tsk tsk" from the women's team, knowing that they were all suffering from "internal urgency." He took out a snuff bottle from his side, poured out the snuff, and slowly touched the nose tube, with a leisurely attitude. The villagers on the same boat saw this situation and didn't quite understand it. They said, what's the use of sniffing this thing? He replied: This is very precious snuff. Sniffing it can smooth the Qi. There is also a wonderful use, that is, people who travel out, must take it. Sniffing this smoke, you won't want to urinate. If you want to urinate, sniffing it, you can also endure it. When the generally urgent women heard this, they secretly exclaimed in wonder. They said, can everyone pool some money and buy some from you, sir, to make it easier? The humorist said generously: Everyone is out, we should help each other, what do you need money for? The women thanked him again and again; he then transported the snuff to each person's palm. As a result, all the women, without prior consultation, smelled this "miracle medicine." Unexpectedly, there was an instant response like an echo, some sneezing repeatedly, some coughing frequently, all breaking out. After this violent shock, the urine that had been brewing for a long time in the lower part could no longer be endured and burst out. They frowned, blushed, and complained about being fooled by him, saying that he should not have made this joke for no reason. The humorist also said: This is not because the snuff is not effective, it is really because you are not used to smelling this snuff. Otherwise, how could there be such a reaction!</p>
<h3>Lamenting Jiang Weiwen</h3>
<p>— Geng Bai</p>
<p>Jiang Weiwen is the one the world calls Ms. Ding Ling. Last New Year's Eve, I bid her farewell at Dafu's place. Before long, news of her death arrived. Weiwen was the wife of the Communist Party member Hu Yepin. After Yepin died, she became more left-leaning. She was good at modern prose and novels. The young man Feng Da also died tragically. At that time, I mourned him. Shocked that the time of parting was over on New Year's Eve, the words were sad, and the countenance was connected with what was grieved. How could anyone be spared in a chaotic world? It is difficult to know why one died in a country in danger. Rumors spread that there was still an official present, and secrets still held a wife's doubts. Hu and Feng in the underworld should be silent, and even bet on a double life in the ghostly records.</p>
<p>Walking in the Morning with the Rosy Clouds</p>
<p>There is a slight coolness to comfort the journey, and the green leaves by the roadside are uneven. The gold and silver night air are seen sinking, and the fragrant herbs in my heart are vast. The red-clothed road clearer works hard, and the white-robed youth lingers. Like thunder, the sound shakes the edge of the world, cherish the good time and the unsown threads!</p>
<p>Recipe</p>
<h3>Seasonal Fresh Fruits</h3>
<p>— Zhu Chuo</p>
<p>In this summer season of pomegranate blossoms and lotus coins emerging from the water, the brilliant spring flowers have all borne plump and delicious fruits. With their deep red colors and sweet tastes, when you walk past the fruit shops piled high with apricot red and plum green, the enticing colors cannot help but arouse your appetite. Summer is indeed a rich and seasonal season for fruits. Suzhou also produces several kinds of seasonal fresh fruits during this period. Now I will write them down below.</p>
<p>The plums of Dengwei Mountain in Guangfu Town are famous throughout the country, so plums are also a Suzhou product. The taste of plums, when eaten raw, is sour enough to make your teeth ache. Except for some people who like to eat sour foods, not everyone likes to eat them. But there are many kinds of foods made from plums. In addition to white sugar plums (green plums mixed with white sugar), sugar and oil plums, and crisp plums, the most famous, of course, is tangerine peel plums. This kind of food has the effect of digesting food and promoting salivation. The tangerine peel plums produced by Guanshengyuan are especially popular throughout the country. The frosted plums in the southern goods shops are necessary by-products for making rose sauce. There are also five or six kinds of foods made from plums in Suzhou tea shops, such as "sour mouth" (sweet and salty), "green plum," "dried green plum," and "medicinal plum slices" (rose, licorice, and osmanthus). The sweet and salty plum skin is an expensive tea snack, selling for more than two yuan a catty. In addition, there are also plum sauce and sour plum soup, which are also foods made mainly from plums.</p>
<p>Apricots, with their deep red color, are so tempting to the appetite; apricots are also a delicious fruit. The fresh apricots are ripe, sweet and delicious, and the taste is very good. The dried apricots in tea shops are also a good food. Although the dried apricots made in Suzhou are still delicious, compared to the dried apricots produced in Beiping, they are sweet but not vulgar, fat but not greasy, but they are not as thick and delicious. The kernels in apricot pits are not only a good food, but also can be used as a medicine for treating coughs. Mash the apricot kernels, filter the juice, and cook it with sugar. It tastes good and also has the effect of relieving coughs and moistening the lungs. It is a good drink.</p>
<p>Peaches, with the most juice and delicious, peaches, of course, are top-quality fruits. The peaches produced in Suzhou include Luolin peaches, salty sour peaches, red peaches, and honey peaches. Although their taste is not as delicious as the honey peaches of Huawu and the Feicheng peaches of Shandong, the sweet juice splashes everywhere and the sweetness lingers in the teeth. Eating them makes you feel happy, especially the honey peaches of Jiangpu, which are even more famous in Suzhou. Those peaches are slightly crimson in the tender white, and the colors are also delicate and dripping. In addition to eating raw, peaches can also be made into jam and canned food. Mixing them with cold ice and eating them makes your teeth feel cool, and it is still a wonderful way to get rid of the heat, not letting melons and plums take all the credit.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of loquats: red sand and white sand. Dongting Mountain in Taihu Lake and Guangfu Town are both production areas of loquats. Those ball-like fruits, when eaten, are sweet and immersed in the mouth and teeth. Not only is the taste delicious, but they also have the effect of moisturizing the lungs and intestines. The loquats produced in Suzhou are most famous in Yaoshang, Guangfu. The white sand loquats, like crystal balls, are small in form, but the fresh sweetness of the taste is second to none. Making loquat paste is also a wonderful cough medicine, and it has the same effect as apricot kernels.</p>
<p>When Yangmei bayberries are ripe, the grains of fiery beads cover the mountains and valleys, decorating Dongting Mountain with a different kind of shadow. Bayberries are the most produced fruit in Suzhou. Their taste is slightly sour in the sweetness. When eating them, because they have no skin to protect them, you must first wash them with cold boiled water, and then add some salt before eating them. However, if you eat too much, your tongue will become hairy and lose its ability to distinguish flavors. Soaking bayberries in shochu, when aged, can cure diarrhea.</p>
<p>The taste of fruits is fresh and delicious, and they also have the effect of eating. "An apple a day keeps the doctor away," which shows the effect of fruits. Therefore, eating some fruits after meals is very beneficial to the body. However, being greedy and insatiable and chewing arbitrarily will cause diarrhea. Therefore, eating fruits must also be limited, otherwise it will become "disease enters through the mouth," which is harmful and not beneficial.</p>

<h3>Remedial Measures by the Municipal Examination Committee for Disputes in Secondary School Examinations</h3>
<p>Strict Investigation of Staff Who Leaked Test Questions, Selecting a Date to Draft Questions and Go to Various Middle Schools to Continue the Examination, Interview with Jiang Shuxun, Standing Committee Member of the High School Group The Municipal Education Bureau held the municipal secondary school graduation examination this time. A dispute suddenly occurred the day before yesterday, resulting in a temporary suspension of the examination. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency visited the Education Bureau yesterday to interview Jiang Shuxun, the standing committee member of the high school group of the Examination Committee, and asked whether the committee had any methods to deal with and remedy the situation. Committee Member Jiang received and answered.</p>
<h3>Circumstances of the Day</h3>
<p>Mr. Jiang first said that the committee had been very careful in handling the elementary and middle school graduation examinations this time. The order at each examination venue was very good on the first and second days. I was secretly congratulating myself. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the third day, a dispute suddenly occurred in the English examination at the high school one and three examination venues, where a part of the essay questions was leaked. Upon receiving the report, the committee immediately telegraphed each examination venue to temporarily replace the essay questions to remedy the situation. However, the order at the two examination venues was not easy to maintain, and it had to be announced that the examination would be temporarily suspended for thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Remedial Measures</h3>
<p>Mr. Jiang continued that the committee has already discussed methods to deal with this unfortunate dispute yesterday: (1) The committee members will assist the chairman in strictly investigating the staff who leaked the test questions this time, and if necessary, transfer them to the judicial organs for investigation and strict handling. (2) The subjects that the students have not yet taken will still be re-examined by the committee, and the Education Bureau will send personnel to various middle schools to make up the examinations. The principals and some faculty members of each middle school will also be invited to supervise the examinations. The examination period will probably be within the next two or three days. After the date is selected, it will be notified immediately. (3) The committee will consider the actual situation when evaluating the students' test papers. If a student fails a certain subject, the student's grades at school will be taken into consideration to determine the grade. I hope that all students participating in the examination will complete this examination. It is not appropriate to abandon the examination halfway due to the thorough investigation of a part of the test questions, otherwise the effort will be wasted, and it will affect further education and employment.</p>
<h3>Municipal Elementary School Examinations Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The municipal secondary school graduation examination suddenly experienced a dispute the day before yesterday, so the examination was temporarily suspended.

<p>Davis Cup European Zone</p>
<h3>Australia Gains Finals Spot, Eliminating Japan Three to Zero</h3>
<p>Bitter Fight in Second Day Doubles</p>
<p>Victory Decided After Five Sets</p>
<p>(Havas Agency, Paris, 18th) Today, in the second day of the Davis Cup European Zone semi-final against Australia, the Australian doubles team defeated Japan, joining the European Zone finals and facing the winner of the England-Czech Republic match. The details are described below:</p>
<p>Crawford-Quist (Aus) 7-5, 7-9, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 Sato-Bui (Jap)</p>
<h3>Fierce Competition from the Start</h3>
<p>Today's match between Japan and Australia began at 5:10 PM due to rain. The Australian team was Quist and Crawford, and the Japanese team was Sato and Bui. Judging from the opening, it could be predicted that the competition would be extremely fierce. Both sides' players all knew how to exploit each other's weaknesses, taking advantage of openings to attack, and especially Crawford's backhand was exceptionally strong. Australia won the first game of the first set, followed by the Japanese players, who took the next three games.</p>
<h3>Australian Players Win First Set</h3>
<p>Then, the Australian players changed their strategy, hitting high balls to force the enemy to run back to the baseline, then attacking with a drop shot. Both sides first tied at three to three, then four to four, five to five. Australia ultimately won the first set with seven to five.</p>
<h3>Bui of Japan is Impeccable</h3>
<p>In the second set, the Australian team again won three games in a row with a high shot. The match was temporarily suspended for twenty minutes due to rain. After the resumption, the Japanese players worked hard to regain two games, but Sato was slightly lacking, and the Australian team won another game, taking a four to two lead. The Japanese team then tied it up again at four to four, five to five, and seven to seven. At this point, Bui fought hard, and his performance was impeccable. The Japanese team won the second set with nine to seven.</p>
<h3>Crawford Exploits Weaknesses</h3>
<p>In the third set, Sato showed signs of fatigue, and the court was also very heavy and slow after the rain. After the ball landed, it was difficult to bounce up. Crawford exploited this, using a slice to control the enemy. The Australian team was able to win the third set with six to three.</p>
<h3>Tie at Two to Two</h3>
<p>In the fourth set, both sides showed signs of fatigue, especially Sato and Crawford. Among the four, the young Bui was the best. Although the Australian players attacked Bui from time to time, he handled it with ease. Sato also cheered himself up, so the Japanese team ultimately won the fourth set with three to six.</p>
<h3>Japan Eliminated After Bitter Fight</h3>
<p>The fifth set was the most intense. The Australian players ultimately won with six to three. Looking at the overall situation of the match, all four players were admirable. Among them, Bui, although young, has already shown great potential, and his future is limitless. The rain today also had an impact on the match. If the court had not been wet, it would have been difficult to determine who would have won.</p>

<p>Donghua Football Team's Philippine Campaign (IV) Fourth Match: 3-0 Victory Over the All-Philippine Team (Special dispatch from our reporter Wen Chu in Manila)</p>
<h3>Victory Over All-Philippine Team 3-0</h3>
<p>On the 6th, Donghua fought for the fourth time, and their opponent was the All-Philippine National Team. With a score of three to zero, they won a great victory, maintaining their undefeated status and overcoming the elite of Philippine football, adding a glorious page to the brilliant history of Chinese football. The Donghua forwards attacked, creating unexpected victories. The defense's strength and rigor has repeatedly demonstrated its prowess in the three matches. Yesterday, in a bloody battle with the All-Philippine players, the entire team worked together with one heart, achieving this result. This must be recorded.</p>
<h3>Opponents Showed Power First</h3>
<p>The two enemies first took a photo together to commemorate the event. Then, the referee summoned the captains of both sides to choose their goals. Donghua gained the advantage of playing with the sun behind them and the wind at their backs. Around five o'clock, the two armies declared the start of the match with the referee Seili's silver whistle. The center forward of the All-Philippine team moved the ball, displaying a majestic demeanor, and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese defense line. However, the defense was blocked by Tu, Feng, and Sun, and the ball fell back into the All-Philippine territory. Donghua's five forwards advanced and attacked in unison. The ball was released by the left center defender Yang, and the two teams fought fiercely back and forth for several minutes as they chased the ball.</p>
<h3>Rolling Dust, But No Success</h3>
<p>Donghua's five forwards suddenly used a feint to the east and attack to the west, breaking through the center defense and heading straight for the goal. The momentum was very fierce. The Philippine right defender rushed out to parry, resisting with a flying body. Feng Yunyou charged out on horseback and shot while falling to the ground. The ball was fast and urgent, hitting the crossbar of the center of the goal, and the ball bounced out of the goal, fifteen yards away. Chen Jiaqiu rushed forward and added a kick, but the ball was slightly too high and went over the goal. These two balls failed to go straight into the enemy's fort, causing regrets in the four seats. However, although they did not hit, this display of power from Feng and Chen shocked the enemy. Soon, Donghua returned with renewed strength, like an avalanche overturning the sea. Sun Zhongjing intercepted the ball and advanced alone, forming a one-on-one attack. He was ten yards away from the enemy's goal when he was entangled by the left center. However, the Tiger General Sun still shot, and the shot was caught by the Philippine goalkeeper and kicked not far away, just intercepted by Chen Yutian, who shot again, but unfortunately went slightly out of bounds, unable to establish a miracle.</p>
<p>Triangular Advantage Was in Vain. Donghua launched another attack, forcing three corner kicks, but the other side's defenses were solid, with no gaps to exploit. Donghua's forwards and center defenders repeatedly ravaged the enemy's goal, creating dangerous situations. Although the iron goalkeeper desperately tried to turn the tide, the ball still hovered in the area in front of the All-Philippine goal. With such valiant resistance from the enemy, it could be seen that without an unexpected victory, victory would not be easy to achieve.</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting Achieves Unexpected Victory. During this melee, Chen Hongguang suddenly received a pass from Qian Jingyong and suddenly broke through. Chen Jiaqiu advanced shoulder to shoulder, breaking through the center defense. The enemy's left defender came out to resist. Chen Hongguang dribbled the ball and ran quickly, dodging left and right, and then passed to Chen Jiaqiu. Chen Guang passed the ball to the right, and Cao Qiuting dribbled along the sideline. With a loud bang, he shot diagonally into the net. The enemy goalkeeper knelt to block the ball, but the shot was so powerful that it rebounded into the net, earning cheers from the entire field. With this first goal, our side's momentum greatly increased.</p>
<p>The Enemy Launches a Brave Counterattack. The All-Philippine players, being an elite force, could not accept defeat after losing this goal. The forwards became even more determined to encourage the army and tried hard to seize the opportunity to counterattack and seek revenge. From its right inside forward, the long-legged fairy, got support from the rear, urging the horse forward, deeply aware that Donghua's defense was solid, he made a long shot near the center defense line. Lu Zhongen received the shot and bounced it outside the goal. Ao's forward wanted to meet it again with his foot. At this critical moment, our goalkeeper could not rescue in time, but fortunately, Guan Xun'an gave no thought to his safety, kicked it on the ground, and the siege was lifted. Without the Long Guan General, it would not have been possible to stop the enemy.</p>
<p>Taking Advantage of the Victory, We Display Our Might Again. After a short rest, we changed bases and fought again. Donghua, in order to change the battle strategy, slightly adjusted its personnel. Feng Yunyou was appointed right defender, Liang Shutang was appointed left center defender, Chen Jiaqiu was appointed right inside forward, and Li Yichen was appointed center forward. This gentleman had previously suffered from stomach problems, causing him not to display his good skills in the three games. Today, he recovered and was in high spirits. His movements were active, and his dribbling and sliding tackling skills were truly miraculous. In the cheers of the match, the former enemy commander raised his arms and shouted, leading the three armies to scout east and west, passing back and forth, and advancing step by step. Qian Jingyong received Sun Sijing's high ball and headed it to Li Yichen. Li immediately shot the ball straight in, although it was caught by the enemy goalkeeper, but the pressure was so overwhelming that it was almost invincible.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick: Enemy Fortress Falls Again. Under this devastating pressure, the enemy army, taking advantage of the wind, tried hard to counterattack, forcing three corner kicks, but all three attempts were blocked by Lu Zhongen. After that, there were ups and downs, and the battle became even more intense, but Donghua repeatedly took the offensive. Li Yichen won the ball and passed it high to Qian Jingyong. Qian headed it, just hitting the All-Philippine goal. Cao Qiuting rushed forward and headed it again. Garcia punched the ball out of bounds, but since Donghua's five tiger generals had surrounded the All-Philippine city gate, it was impenetrable. In the chaotic battle before the penalty area, the All-Philippine center defender touched the ball with his hand. Referee Seili immediately judged a twelve-yard free kick. Li Yichen took the kick and succeeded.</p>
<p>Li Yichen Achieves Another Goal. After Donghua won two goals, its military might became even more intense. Although the enemy army counterattacked several times, they were all severely rejected by Lu Zhongen's jumping. From this point until the end of the game, Donghua was in control. At that time, the area within ten steps of the enemy's goal was almost an area where the two armies were engaged in battle. While the two armies were fighting fiercely, Cao Qiuting's feet were magical, and he suddenly passed the ball to Chen Hongguang, who charged into the enemy's territory, then passed it to Li Yichen. Li advanced a few steps, and the enemy's goal fell at the point of his right foot. By the time the game was over, Donghua had won the All-Philippine National Team by three to zero.</p>

<h3>"Copying Targets"</h3>
<p>— Sojourn</p>
<p>China is ultimately the most ancient civilization, and also a country that has always valued humanity. People have always been highly regarded. As for occasional insults, executions, and killings, it's because these things were not considered people. What the emperor executed was "rebellion," what the government troops suppressed was "bandits," and what the executioners killed was "criminals." The Manchus, after "entering and ruling China," soon became imbued with this simple custom. When the Yongzheng Emperor wanted to get rid of his brothers, he first bestowed upon them the derogatory names "Akina" and "Seshe," which I don't understand in Manchu, and can't translate accurately, but I suppose they roughly mean "pig" and "dog." When Huang Chao rebelled, he used people as food, but it would be incorrect to say he ate people; the things he ate were called "two-legged sheep." The time is the 20th century, and the place is Shanghai. Although in its bones, it forever "values humanity," on the surface, of course, there will be some differences. As for what epithets foreign masters bestow upon a certain part of the Chinese who are not considered "people," I do not know. I only know the names given by the subordinates of the foreign masters. If you often walk on the roads of the concessions, you will sometimes encounter several uniformed compatriots and a foreigner (often without even that one), pointing a pistol at you, searching your whole body and the objects you are carrying. If you are white, they won't point it at you; if you are yellow, and if the person pointed at says they are Japanese, they will lower the pistol and ask them to walk past. Only the descendants of the most ancient Yellow Emperor "shall not be exempt from this." In Hong Kong, this is called "body search," which is not too undignified. However, in Shanghai, it is actually called "copying targets."</p>
<p>"Copying" means searching. A "target" is something that should be shot with a gun. I have only known the true meaning of this term since September of the year before last. Four hundred million targets are lined up in the most ancient civilization, and my selfish hope is that I haven't been hit yet. The foreign masters' subordinates have really given their compatriots an excellent name.</p>
<p>However, when we "targets" choose our own representatives, we still have to be polite. I am not an "old Shanghai hand," and I don't know what terms of abuse Shanghai people previously used to address each other. But looking at the records, it was only "crooked braid," "Amulin." Although "shou tou ma zi" is already a veiled reference to "pig," it is still a veiled reference, containing the lofty sentiment of preferring "elegance" to "clarity." As for now, if someone considers you not respectful enough towards them, they will widen their eyes, which are full of red veins, tighten their throat, and spew out two words with white foam at the corners of their mouth: "Pig!"</p>
<h3>Trapped</h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>Due to someone's insidious plan, one day, Bear lost his freedom. He was locked into a small world not big enough for him to even roll twice. He saw the world outside of his world. He wanted to escape that boundary, so he lunged at it, but his head was knocked back by the iron bars. He suffered injuries, both physical and mental. He squatted. He gazed at the world outside of his world. He looked and lunged, lunged and looked. He repeated this so many times until experience stopped him.</p>
<p>At first, he refused the food that people prepared for him. "This is an insult," he thought. He would rather starve to death. He would never eat something that he didn't expend effort to chase after. "To use some beef and a few pieces of bread as the price for someone's freedom is too shameless!" he resented.</p>
<p>But his gradually increasing hunger made him panic, and his eyes were bursting with sparks. He wanted to find food himself. He looked at the iron bars again. He hesitated. He involuntarily glanced at the beef and bread. He circled around the beef and bread. He glanced at them again. He suddenly lunged at them, as if they were a live rabbit or something else that would run away.</p>
<p>Day after day, time after time passed, and his stubbornness seemed to have completely disappeared. He was content in that small world, as if that small world was his original world! He no longer thought about the world outside the iron bars. When food came, he ate it; when it didn't come, he waited, knowing that it would always come, as if he were the most patient creature in the world.</p>
<p>What angered him the most was when children, and even sometimes adults, used things like peanuts to tease him. He didn't particularly like to eat those things, but he could use it to relieve his boredom. He was always tempted to go forward, either using his claws to receive them, or opening his mouth to wait for them to be thrown. He felt his own pitiful appearance. "I will eat you all myself one day!" In his anger, he could only comfort himself like this. He tried to comfort himself, in order to make himself content in his small world.</p>
<h3>Reading the Popular Edition of "The Rout"</h3>
<p>— Lin Yizhi</p>
<p>These are years of chaos and turmoil, everything is murky and confused, everything is shrouded in darkness. The vicious reality is truly unbearable, and it is also a "dazzling array" that makes you not know how to understand it, grasp it, or change it. In order to seek understanding, the call for culture resounds as loudly as the cannons of imperialism, especially among young people who are new to society, and the masses who have always been left in the dark corners of ignorance. Adapting to this demand, in today's situation where all industries and businesses are depressed, bookstores are showing an abnormal development. But among the dazzling array of publications displayed in the glass windows of Fourth Avenue, how many can truly help these people to understand reality? This is difficult to answer.</p>
<p>Because I was entrusted by friends who are younger and more naive than myself, I am always wandering on Fourth Avenue for half a day, and finally return with empty hands. I think this kind of pain is very common; then, today, the joy of buying this popular edition of "The Rout" is also easy to imagine.</p>
<p>This is the third time I have read Fadeyev's famous work "The Rout." The first time, I read the Japanese translation by Kurahara Korehito, and felt a great deal of interest. Here I discovered many vivid characters, not unfamiliar Russians, but very familiar people around me, people I could see in daily life, there were friends, and even myself in the book. This kind of interest can often be encountered in many world-famous books, but what Fadeyev wrote is the era we are in. Thus, Medick feels more real than Rodin, Levinson is more active than Faust, and Moreyska is much more familiar than Don Quixote. This kind of artistic character archetype, in China, we have only seen a little in books such as "Water Margin" and "Dream of the Red Chamber," and in modern works, it seems that there is only one Ah Q so far. Most people who write literary works have an old rule: two kinds of people, one good and one evil, and both are born that way, and will never change until death. But in reality, it is not like this. Levinson also has inner turmoil, but in the end, he still moves forward. Medick is often very indignant, and often deserts on the eve of battle, so "The Rout" writes about reality. At that time, when I read this work, I thought of many Chinese readers who could not read it. Fortunately, soon there was a translation by Mr. Lu Xun. The second time I read this Chinese edition, I broke through many difficulties and obstacles that I felt in the Japanese translation. Mr. Lu Xun's translation has indeed made the best effort, but when introducing it to friends, there are still many complaints that they cannot read it. China's cultural century is too far away from Europe and the United States, and even college students only know how to read those mediocre and repetitive triangular, quadrilateral, and even countless-angled love novels. What can you do? But now there is a way, that is, to popularize famous works like this popular edition of "The Rout." This is the third time I have read this popular edition. At least for the young people who entrusted me to buy the book, I feel exceptionally happy. A work of more than 100,000 words has been reduced to 30,000 words, but the faces of several important characters, and the entire development of the story, can be largely completely preserved. So that those who cannot afford high-level art also have the opportunity to smell the breath of it, and its achievements are by no means comparable to those gentlemen who compile literary lectures and novel guides. To produce great art that helps to understand reality, grasp reality, and change reality, there is no ready-made legacy to inherit, and translation cannot be popularized today, so I think this work is very valuable, but the person who can truly popularize high-level works must be a person who can truly understand high-level works, otherwise, if it is skinned and slaughtered alive, and becomes a lifeless zombie, that is an infinite sin.</p>
<h3>The Transformation of Mountain Songs in Western Fujian</h3>
<p>— Tiesheng</p>
<p>In the western part of Fujian Province, there is little arable land and many mountains, and the general people live in extremely difficult conditions. Because of this reason, unrest has been frequent for several years, without any respite.</p>
<p>The people in the western part of Fujian are mostly "guests" ("Hakka"). The mountain songs of the "guests" are very famous. Their love, their hope, their poverty, their depression, can all be expressed in their mountain songs. We can say that mountain songs are a reflection of their entire lives.</p>
<p>I remember six years ago, when the farmers in western Fujian first rioted, they also used mountain songs as a propaganda tool. For example: "If I don't tell you, you won't know, (read in a low voice) the time for the riot has arrived! Build our government, axe, sickle, XX flag." I heard that this kind of propaganda did indeed have a lot of effect.</p>
<p>Now, five or six years have passed since the time of the riots. In such a long period of turmoil, the people are of course more miserable than before, but their thinking has changed greatly. We can get a glimpse of this from the following mountain songs. For example:</p>
<p>"Mother, don't worry, your son is working as a cook outside,</p>
<p>My monthly wage is two and a half yuan, I will definitely make a name for myself in the future."</p>
<p>In this mountain song, on the one hand, he wants to comfort his mother, and on the other hand, he expresses that with such a lowly job and such a meager wage, where will there be a chance to make a name for himself in the future? Also, for example:</p>
<p>"Living in the mountains, I'm afraid of the monkeys, living in the countryside, I'm afraid of the local tyrants,</p>
<p>Living in the shops, I'm afraid of the bosses, living at home, I'm afraid of my mother-in-law."</p>
<p>Here, it also expresses that no matter where they are, there are demons oppressing them. They have no choice but to strive and resist. In addition, from the following two mountain songs, we can see how women generally hate the members of the Bao Wei Tuan (local militia), and express goodwill towards people who are hostile to the militia members. For example:</p>
<p>"Build a pavilion on the hillside, love your man, but don't love the militia member!</p>
<p>Chickens, cattle, pigs, and ducks have to be taxed, oil, salt, tea, and rice have to pay transit tax!"</p>
<p>"Love your man, but don't love the militia member, loving a militia member is a laughingstock!</p>
<p>When the X army hasn't arrived, they run away first, when the X army leaves, they become vicious orangutans!"</p>
<p>There are really countless mountain songs like this! I think this kind of transformation in the thinking of popular folk songs is very worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Carrot Hair</h3>
<p>— Julei Kenero, Translated by Lin Quzuo</p>
<p>Silver Coin (1) Continued</p>
<p>Carrot Hair, yes, Mother.</p>
<p>Rebique's Family, I forbid you to say "yes, Mother" again, and I forbid you to act pretentious; you watch out, if I hear you humming, carefree, learning to whistle through your teeth like a carter, you'll be sorry. I don't allow you to pick up these bad habits?</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Carrot Hair walked slowly on the path in the garden. He sighed. He searched briefly, and then dropped the search in disgust. When he sensed his mother was watching him, he stood still, bending down and using his fingertips to search between the grass and fine sand. Once he sensed Rebique's Family had turned away, he stopped searching. He raised his head and continued walking.</p>
<p>Just where could that silver coin be? Could it be there, in the tree, in that old bird's nest?</p>
<p>Sometimes careless people who aren't looking for anything at all find money. People have seen that happen. But Carrot Hair rolled on the ground, using his knees and claws, but couldn't find a needle.</p>
<p>Too lazy to wander, too lazy to hope aimlessly, Carrot Hair gave up and decided to go back to the house and see how his mother was doing. Maybe she had calmed down, or maybe she had given up because the coin couldn't be found.</p>
<p>He didn't see Rebique's Family. He called to her, softly.</p>
<p>"Mother, ah! Mother!"</p>
<p>Mother didn't answer. She had just gone out, and she had left the drawer of her sewing table wide open. Among the wool ropes, needles, white, red, and black spools of thread, Carrot Hair saw several silver coins.</p>
<p>These silver coins seemed to have always been there. They seemed to be sleeping there, rarely disturbed, pushed from one corner to another, mixed together, and it was impossible to tell how many there were.</p>
<p>It seemed like there were only three or four, and it seemed like there were seven or eight. It was very difficult to count them. It would be necessary to turn the drawer over and clear out the spools of thread. And even if they were counted, what proof would there be?</p>
<p>With the kind of cunning that only disappears on important occasions, Carrot Hair made up his mind, reached out his arm, stole a coin, and ran away.</p>
<p>The feeling of being afraid of being touched made him have no time to hesitate, regret, or risk going back to the table. He ran straight out, too fast to stop, and walked all over the garden, looking for a suitable place to put the money down, stepping on it with his foot, falling down himself, sleeping with his belly on the ground, his nose tickled by the green grass. He crawled around, drawing irregular circles, just like when playing with a group of children, with his eyes covered, circling around the hidden object, while the person directing the game anxiously patted his legs and shouted:</p>
<p>"Be careful! Don't get burned, don't get burned!"</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Carrot Hair, Mother, Mother, I found it.</p>
<p>Rebique's Family, I found it too. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Monday's Silver Dollar Settlements Slightly Busy</p>
<p>Taels Remained Unchanged</p>
<p>Yesterday, banking circles were busy with various settlements due to the start of the week. The recent influx of imported goods made the goods settlements particularly numerous. Foreign firms settled over 900,000 silver dollars and over 1.7 million taels for goods, and over 2.45 million silver dollars and 3.45 million taels for bill settlements. Various remittance deposits and miscellaneous items settled over 3.4 million silver dollars and 2.78 million taels. Special item settlements amounted to over 1.8 million silver dollars, and final settlements were over 3 million silver dollars and over 1 million taels. Warehouse releases were 800,000 taels and 400,000 silver dollars. Chinese banks settled over 2.78 million taels in bill settlements, over 6.2 million taels in various goods, remittance, tax, and miscellaneous items, over 2.78 million taels in special item settlements, and over 3 million taels in final settlements. Warehouse entries were 400,000 taels. Japanese firms had warehouse entries of 300,000 silver dollars and warehouse releases of 400,000 taels. Private banks settled over 44.4 million taels in silver public drafts, over 7.4 million taels in interbank fund transfers, over 800,000 taels in various remittances, over 2.1 million taels in tael deposits, over 2.4 million taels in banknotes in and out, and 200,000 taels withdrawn by customers. The tael interbank lending rate was 8% in both morning and afternoon sessions, with no additional water (premium) for interbank fund transfers, initially white transfers, then slightly up to 0.02 taels. The early session's transfer trades amounted to over 5.1 million taels, new trades over 900,000 taels, the afternoon session's trades over 500,000 taels, and trades in the Small General Association over 700,000 taels. The total exchanged amount at the Shanghai Joint Reserve Committee Clearing House on June 19, year 22, was 5,445,111.91 silver dollars, including 2,938,698.80 silver dollars in cash and 2,506,413.11 silver dollars in remittance transfers.</p>
<h3>Subsidiary Currency Returns to Stability</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small dollars remained at 850.50 yuan, the same as the previous day, with trades in the morning session totaling 9,000 jiao (dimes), and no trades in the afternoon session. Guangdong small dollars, after soaring the previous day, fell back yesterday to normal levels, with the morning session at 774.50 yuan and the afternoon session at 773.70 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 4.3 yuan from the previous day's afternoon session. Trades in the morning session totaled 75,000 jiao, and in the afternoon session, 55,000 jiao. Copper coins remained at 317,000 cash coins, with trades totaling over 41,000 strings of cash coins.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Market Remain Stagnant</h3>
<p>Long-Short Wait-and-See, Trading Increasingly Scarce</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange saw no improvement in the market, and the wavering trend finally appeared unable to recover. Trading continued to decline, and the market will only see activity after changes occur. Trading for this month is expected for only six days. Generally, both long and short positions cannot hold out to the end, and their true strength will inevitably be revealed. Within these few days, once shaken, their competition will also arise. Therefore, the arrival of change is not far off. Observing yesterday's situation, both long and short sides are still holding on, waiting for an opportunity to move. In the morning's first session, the distant delivery military bond fell 0.04 yuan, clearly showing short covering, but after entering the market, long positions also covered, resulting in a flat market. In the second session, although both sides still showed covering intentions, the price support was very strong, with fluctuations limited to 0.005 or 0.01 yuan, and rises and falls were uneven. However, the distant delivery salt tax bond was quite firm. The afternoon's first session felt slightly stronger, with a slight increase of 0.01 to 0.03 yuan for the more active ones. Before the close, various listings continued to rise slightly by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan, but after entering the market, they felt sluggish again. Various year 21 listings were slightly down by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan, but the distant delivery salt tax bond still rose by 0.015 yuan. As a result, rises and falls were mixed, with small fluctuations of 0.005 yuan and large fluctuations of 0.02 yuan, with more declines than rises, the largest decline being 0.04 yuan for the entire session. There were slight sell-offs for the 11th and 14th issues, and the rest were insignificant. The total traded volume was only 6,000,002 yuan, including 12,000 yuan in spot goods, and 2,385,000 yuan in total futures for salt tax, 810,000 yuan for military bonds, 1,030,000 yuan for the 19 Customs bonds, and 1,115,000 yuan for the 20-year, 20-customs bonds. The rest ranged from 20,000 to 120,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>New York Stocks Firm</h3>
<p>Report from Sin Fung Trading Company: On Saturday (the 17th) of last week, the New York stock market was calm and firm due to good news from various sources. Railway freight volume for the week ending June 10 totaled 564,546 cars, breaking the highest record for this year, an increase of 56,312 cars from the previous week. The half-day trading volume totaled 1,568,000 shares. According to a telegram from the company's New York-based financial issue organization, since Congress finally passed the construction of a large number of warships and the adjournment of Congress, no matter what the public's trust is, and even though the construction work is indeed encountering difficulties, this steady pace has its seriousness. Therefore, if the market rises further, it will fully express the selection effect based on the profit expectations of each stock. If currency devaluation does not continue to follow, commercial activity will also not have a special advancement phenomenon, and speculative frenzy seems to be temporarily suppressed. The Dow Jones index for Saturday is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 9.023 Up 1.01</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 41.67 Up 0.50</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 33.39 Up 0.36</p>
<p>40 Bonds 84.6 Up 0.11</p>
<p>American Cotton Will Destroy Huge Amounts of Cotton Fields</p>
<h3>Standard Cotton Yarn Still in a Calm Process</h3>
<p>The yarn market remained weak, and news from overseas cotton industries trended downward, causing discouragement. The delivery of this month's yarn is becoming increasingly abundant, and buyers are softening. In the afternoon, there was some slight activity due to demand for spot yarn, and some short positions took the opportunity to cover, causing a slight rise at the close. However, sentiment in the market remained subdued.</p>
<h3>Man-Mark Continues to Fall Half a Dollar</h3>
<p>The opening of the Man-Mark market was sluggish due to poor American cotton news, causing listlessness. Buyers were lacking, and prices for all months fell by 0.03, 0.06, and 0.07 yuan. The market remained weak after the afternoon opening, but rebounded by 0.02 and 0.03 yuan at the close. The total traded volume for the day was 25,200 bales. Sellers included Senkang with 2,150 bales, Gengfeng with 1,500 bales, Dafu with 650 bales, and Deji with 600 bales. Buyers included Tongfu with 1,150 bales, Tonghe with 1,000 bales, Renfeng with 650 bales, Dafeng with 650 bales, and Liuchang with 500 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>Spot yarn sales were slightly active. The total purchases by various groups were 793 bales, with prices down 0.05 yuan. The purchase amounts for each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 290, Nanjing 5, Peers 70, Sichuan 15, Shantou 25</p>
<p>Xiamen 10, Inland 43, Jiangxi 230, Fujian 15</p>
<p>The cotton market was calm, and most long positions relied on the depletion of old cotton, absorbing goods tightly and not releasing them. Therefore, although American cotton fell, the market remained high. In the afternoon, news from Reuters reported the destruction of 120 million acres of cotton fields in the United States, causing shock and slight stabilization in the market.</p>
<h3>Zheng-Mark Soft Before Leveling</h3>
<p>The Zheng-Mark market opened weakly, but there was no increase in new sellers. Prices for all months fell by 0.01 to 0.025 yuan. The market was extremely quiet in the afternoon, with very little trading. Near-month prices rose slightly by 0.005 to 0.015 yuan. The total traded volume for the day was 48,600 dan (bundles). Sellers included Ruidai with 4,500 dan, Chunji with 2,600 dan, Yuanxingchang with 3,700 dan, Shenchang with 1,300 dan, and Tongxing with 1,400 dan. Buyers included Yichang with 2,000 dan, Changfeng with 2,300 dan, Dafeng with 1,000 dan, and Yuanda with 1,700 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Spot Demand Temporarily Halted</h3>
<p>The demand for spot cotton has temporarily halted, and factories have taken no action.</p>
<p>Fire Engine Cotton 45.25 Yufeng Factory enters 300 bales for factory.</p>
<h3>Bombay Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>Although the cotton market was firm last week, it gradually became unstable due to the Japanese boycott of Indian cotton. Japanese sales were unable to absorb the full amount, but orders were still received from Japan, as Japanese factories believed that the boycott would not be prolonged. Currently, people in Bombay deeply believe that the Japanese boycott of Indian cotton will only last a few months and will not become permanent. In terms of spot goods, demand from Far Eastern and European transporters was good, but later decreased slightly. Indian factories had strong purchasing appetites, and the demand for piece goods also showed signs of expansion. The statistics for the past week are attached below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1932 1933</p>
<p>Cumulative receipts since September 1 1,886 2,270</p>
<p>Weekend inventory 850 936</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Rises Due to Rainy Weather</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over 30 boats arrived. Although sales on this street were not yet high, sellers unanimously raised prices due to the continuous rain and scarce boat arrivals. Medium and secondary grades and old goods also slightly increased. Dular and foreign pointed rice also followed suit. The Nanyang and Xinghua groups took action in buying, but the total transaction volume was only over 2,000 bags, including the Beiyang group. Prices also increased slightly. Tongbian rice was soft due to weak demand.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 12 or 13 deliveries from various river ports. Although scattered sales of white glutinous rice continued due to the continuous rain, the amount sold was small, and the market was slightly tight. Thin rice, early rice, and indica rice markets were all stable. Tongbian rice was slightly tight.</p>
<h3>Dular, Guest, Indica, and Zhejiang Rice Are Very Active</h3>
<p>Wuxi Machine-Milled Indica Rises Nearly One Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for Dular and Guest Indica rice was very good, especially the Zhejiang, Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo groups. The Fuzhou group was hesitant. 3,000 bags of Wuxi machine-milled indica rice were taken by Wenzhou and Taizhou, and the price rose nearly a jiao. Other rice varieties were stable. The Ningbo group, which had not been inquired about for many days, took 1,500 bags of Hunan Zhongguan Indica Jing rice yesterday. In addition to taking Wuxi indica rice, Wenzhou and Taizhou also took 500 bags of sheep-pointed rice and 7,000 bags of Beijing indica rice, and 500 bags of small-rolled rice. The Fuzhou group only took 300 bags of Hunan red coarse rice and 100 bags of Jiangbei coarse rice. The market is temporarily stable, but the digestion of both Jiangxi and Hunan indica rice has not been strong in recent days, and the market may be flat in the future.</p>
<h3>Marked Flour and Wheat Plunge</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, huge declines occurred in all months, with new low prices being repeatedly produced. The fierceness of the declines exceeded most people's expectations. Considering that the quotation for foreign wheat, especially Canadian wheat, had risen back by 0.03 or 0.04 yuan, American wheat was unchanged, and there was heavy rain, it was normally unlikely for prices to plummet. However, due to the abundant new wheat and the accumulation of stocks by factories, the market atmosphere was difficult to hold up due to the inability to operate in practice. As the end of the month approached, most long positions were eager to sell, and the market atmosphere became unstable after the opening. Distant months were also frequently sold, and most were also forced to pay taxes due to difficulties in delivering certificates. Factories also offered to sell, and the market atmosphere plummeted. At the opening of the afternoon session, major factories tried their best to sell, and all months, near and far, were readily offered. Most long position clients were thus greatly slaughtered. The lowest prices in the afternoon were 2.26 yuan for June and July, 2.28 yuan for August, 2.30 yuan for September, 2.34 yuan for October, and 2.375 yuan for November. After the sharp declines, prices rebounded slightly. As a result, the current month plummeted 0.0575 yuan compared to the previous week, July fell 0.0575 yuan, August fell 0.06 yuan, September fell 0.0525 yuan, October fell 0.05 yuan, and November fell 0.065 yuan.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, all months showed a consistent sharp decline. As new wheat was abundant, factories in Shanghai and inland had little intention of buying foreign wheat and actively purchasing new wheat. Meanwhile, arrivals from various routes were gradually increasing. Under these circumstances, as if pressured by spot goods, the momentum of long positions was struck step by step, without any remaining courage to revive. Therefore, both the morning and afternoon markets were initially poor, and later further</p>
<p>stimulated by flour, resulting in a major decline. July fell to a low of 3.79 yuan, August to 3.88 yuan, and September broke through 4 yuan, falling to 3.97 yuan. As a final result, July and August each fell 0.09 yuan, September fell 0.08 yuan, and October and November each fell 0.09 yuan. Spot wheat trading had little trading on the surface, with only 500 bags of specially high-quality Huangqiao wheat being offered, with the price falling to 3.70 yuan. However, it was heard that there were also 2,000 to 3,000 bags traded outside the market, with high-quality goods falling to around 3.60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Red Sorghum Market Also Frequently Falls</h3>
<p>Recently, although the source of the red sorghum market is small, there are still stockpiles, and the only outlet is that the Jiangbei group has traffic of two or three cars, and even with continuous telegrams to repair, the market feels even more sluggish. Yesterday, the price of red sorghum in Niuzhuang opened at 2.85 yuan, with five cars sold. Red sorghum in Andong opened at 142 bags, with the price sold at 2.97 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market All See Tense Conditions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slightly tighter trend due to the rising margin. The association quoted No. 24 coarse granulated white common goods at 20 yuan, No. 20 medium granulated white at 19.3 yuan, and KMG mark Dutch red at 16.1 yuan, but no transactions occurred. Changxing Company offered 1,200 bags of KNG red sand at 16.05 yuan, but later wanted to adjust the price to 16.1 yuan due to the shrinking exchange rate. RA cotton Dutch white was at 21.2 yuan, Guanghua Luxi at 20.035 yuan, and Shuzi and Jinzi each retreated 0.04 yuan per lot. Ground granulated plus-wide package was at 20.06 yuan. Buyers became more active due to the rising customs rate, and transactions occurred in various lots. Chaozhou dealers offered over 100 bags of Nali white at 20.25 yuan. High Huanggangqing was continued to be exchanged dozens of bags at 13 yuan. Gao Tizhuang persisted at 13.4 yuan and has not been sold yet, showing strong stance. Bowl Qing was traded over 100 bags at 11.4 yuan, and ordinary sheet green continued to open dozens of baskets at 9.8 yuan. Shanghai's inventory is short, and there is hope for continued rise in the future.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea, Silk Cocoon Market, Depressed Sales</p>
<h3>Shanghai Port Silk Sales, Chinese and Foreign Wait-and-See</h3>
<p>Although the New York standard silk price rose slightly by 0.02, it mainly fluctuated down with small rebounds, Yokohama Japanese silk remained sluggish, and the Shanghai exchange rate for Europe and the United States was stable. Both Chinese and foreign silk merchants adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The future of the silk market remains difficult to predict. Only 30 bales of Shanghai white factory raw silk and 10 bales of Sichuan yellow factory raw silk were traded, with prices remaining stable.</p>
<h3>Rayon Market Sales Clear, Prices Firm</h3>
<p>The rayon market in this port remains difficult to progress. Only Hangzhou silk factories bought 24 cases of July futures for Da Wu, Lan Ning Zi, and Golden Peacock brands at net prices ranging from 171.75 yuan to 157.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wujin New Late Cocoons Already Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The late cocoon production in the four villages of Wujin is limited. Only temporary breeding by silkworm farmers in the Henglin area of the eastern village. Therefore, the cocoon market weighed and collected for only three days before stopping weighing. The new late cocoons have already been shipped to Shanghai. The Xiang Sheng factory tested reeling yesterday to see the size of the reeling yield.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Arrivals and Sales Both Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, arrivals of green tea from both Luzhuang and Pingshui totaled over 6,000 boxes. Each firm displayed new samples, with many excellent quality teas among them. British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Concord, Jinlong, and Tongfu showed unusually strong interest in Zhenmei, Zhenmei Needle, and Shrimp Eye from Tunxi, Shexian, and Suian. The selling price of Gaozhuang Special Zhenmei has been increased to 210 yuan, and the rest are also firm. The sales of Zhenmei from Wenzhou and Yushan local tea farms remained sluggish, and Pingshui continued to lack significant progress. Among red teas from Qimen, Fuliang, Ningzhou, and Jiande, only Jardine Matheson showed strong purchasing interest, while the rest mostly remained on the sidelines. The total transaction volume for red and green tea in the city was over 4,200 boxes, with Luzhuang green tea accounting for the majority.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods and Woolens Only Have Outlets in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, apart from the summer heat-relieving goods, which had some transactions, there were few whole cases of other wool fabrics being opened. Although the Nanjing group continued to purchase, the quantity was also small, mostly yarn-hemp rubber cloth and Pan Biequ, Barre cloth, feather yarn cloth, white drill, etc. Yi Ji's Dao Xiancao white drill was traded at 5.1 yuan, Xingtai at 6.6 yuan, second-grade inferior goods at 3.3 yuan, first-grade fine Barre cloth at 4.67 yuan, second-grade coarse goods at 3.45 yuan, Anli Pan Biequ at 3 yuan, Xiangxing at 2.9 yuan, Tianxiang feather yarn cloth at 4.4 yuan, and Gongping hemp rubber cloth at 1 yuan net price.</p>
<h3>Hardware Market, the Plum Rain Affects Hardware Transportation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the continuous plum rain meant that although there were transactions in the hardware market, the difficulty of loading and exporting goods due to inconvenient transportation made the market feel extremely deserted. Due to the shortage of goods, 90-pound tinplate was increased by 0.02 yuan to 16.9 yuan per box, with over 600 boxes traded. 200 bars of blue lead were purchased by the Huangdan factory at 12.4 yuan, slightly down by 0.01 yuan. Four-point bamboo steel was purchased by a certain construction group at 40 to 50 tons, at 104 yuan per ton. More than 100 bundles of No. 28 galvanized iron tiles were purchased by the Qingdao and Tianjin groups at 16.6 yuan. 600 bars of dotted tin with small baked pattern arrived yesterday, with the price selling at 185 yuan, with the transaction being 350 bars purchased by the Shaoxing group. In addition, there were transactions for road leather, angle iron, and British steel plate, but market prices rarely changed.</p>

<h3>A National Salvation Plan</h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>Everyone can save the country, each with different cleverness, such as "saving the country by chanting scriptures," "saving the country by reading books," "saving the country by dancing," "saving the country by beautiful faces," "saving the country by cultivating the mind," "saving the country by physical education," "saving the country by thrift," "saving the country by aviation," and so on. If you want to open a detailed menu of national salvation, it will probably be more than twenty or thirty kinds. There are indeed many ways to save the country!</p>
<p>However, these are all stopgap measures rather than fundamental solutions. Although "saving the country by cultivating the mind" is somewhat close to a fundamental solution, why should there be this mind, and why should we wait until this mind has problems before "curing" it? These are all things that require a lot of consideration. This lowly person is incompetent and has been thinking hard. In addition to various national salvation movements, I have created a fundamental method to attach myself to the excitement and fulfill my personal responsibilities. However, due to the lack of creative talent, I have been thinking since the national crisis occurred, and more than one year and nine months have passed, and I have not drafted even half a plan. Speaking of this, I am quite ashamed. Fortunately, I also have a day to repay the country. Yesterday, I accidentally read a report in a certain newspaper, which contained a Vienna telegram from Havas on the 6th, and I couldn't help but jump for joy. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>In Graz, an "anarchist writer Grossman advocates the theory of 'eliminating reproductive capacity.'" Secret hospitals have been established in many places, and a number of university medical students have been hired to serve in them. Those who come to seek his services are mostly poor workers who, because their families are growing and they cannot bear the burden, go to Grossman's door, pay a certain fee, and have the medical students perform surgery to eliminate their reproductive capacity. Grossman's business is booming, but unfortunately it was cracked down by the police, and the principal offenders were all imprisoned.</p>
<p>Although there is no way to create, there is a skill to copy. In fact, the merit of translation is no less than that of creation. After reading this telegram, I couldn't help but admire it very much. Although the main purpose of this "anarchist writer" is to solve their social problems, I feel that this invention is truly global and has the necessity of being imported and listed as one of the fundamental plans for national salvation. Now, I will explain my superficial views below:</p>
<p>First, there is probably no doubt about the severity of the national crisis and the need to save the country. However, the reason why the country is not easy to save is because of these "poor workers" and poor farmers who, because their families are growing and they "cannot bear the burden" themselves, do not understand the theory of "eliminating reproductive capacity." Therefore, they think of settling accounts with those who can "bear the burden." Once this trend is started, it cannot be stopped. The East settles accounts, the West also demands debts, and it has been said that "the people have become bandits" (see the recent telegram from Jiangxi) and cannot bear the burden of "encirclement and bombing." This is not only something that those in power regret, but it is also something that we, the people, feel guilty about. As for these "poor" people, because they do not understand how to prohibit or eliminate the increase in "fingers," they "bring disaster to themselves," which is also very pitiful. Therefore, the promotion of the theory of "eliminating reproductive capacity" is the fundamental method of national salvation at present. If we can eliminate the function of producing an infinite number of prospective "poor" people in the future, these existing "poor" people will not be afraid of not dying out one day. By that time, only "wealthy" people will remain in the social arena, and they will be able to achieve "coexistence and co-prosperity." How great would Grossman's achievements be!</p>
<p>As for his transformation from an "anarchist" into a globally famous capitalist through the "booming" of his business, that is naturally expected. What is worrying is whether China's "poor workers" can pay the "certain" fee, which is a question. Fortunately, the promoters are thinking about the future of the national society and will definitely provide various conveniences, such as free services, and will never be as unreasonable as the police in Vienna. This should be much easier than mobilizing 400,000 to 500,000 ocean dollars with monthly fees of more than 1.6 million yuan and not being able to do half a job!</p>
<h3>The Live-In Daughter</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Rain threads drifted outside the window, the weather suddenly turned cold, and reading under the lamp felt like early autumn. Wei anxiously knocked on the door of my small apartment, I stared at him, thinking something unexpected had happened; but Wei grabbed a cigarette from the cigarette tin, lit it, and started smoking, as if he had forgotten he was sitting in my small apartment: at the same time forgetting that I was waiting for his reason for visiting on a rainy night.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" I finally couldn't help but break the silence of the small apartment.</p>
<p>"I'm sharing your bed tonight," Wei answered nonchalantly.</p>
<p>"Does A× know?" I joked about such a common thing.</p>
<p>"It's because of her!" He threw away the cigarette in his hand and said seriously, "I'm moving tomorrow!"</p>
<p>The expected thing happened on an unexpected rainy night.</p>
<p>Wei is a lonely person; his family three thousand miles away has long forgotten him. Because of our past living together, after getting to know each other, we became true</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>friends. Last year, the old residence suffered a fire, and we were eager to find a new place, so we separated. But I am too lazy to move, and after living in this small apartment, I don't want to move anymore, and our new residences are still close, so we have continued this way.</p>
<p>One day when this secretly descended upon the world, after lunch, I carried a book as usual and asked him to go to the French Park with me, but unexpectedly I found a woman in his room. She had a slender figure, a generous demeanor, and always smiled charmingly when she spoke. I knew Wei was not good at socializing, and he hated women even more. When friends told women's stories, he only grabbed paper rolls and smoked frantically. Seeing their friendship that day, it didn't seem like they had just met, "Maybe she's his relative?" Just as I was thinking this, he introduced her to me as Miss Yuan, his live-in partner.</p>
<p>After Wei and Miss Yuan met, his outlook on life completely changed. He was like a wild grass in the morning dew, growing rampantly. Friends were especially happy that this lonely person could encounter such a fortunate event. On holidays, in the evenings, his room was often full of friends, talking and laughing at will, and Miss Yuan never avoided them. Young people are always young people, and in such occasions, they forget their own pains and the oppression of society. Here, there is high-spirited talk, wild singing, and Wei playing that popular song:</p>
<p>Passion numbs weariness,</p>
<p>Love fills emptiness:</p>
<p>People can only find love</p>
<p>To not waste a lifetime.</p>
<p>There was a burst of applause, and we secretly looked at Miss Yuan, a smile lingering at the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>Two months passed like flowing water, but an incident happened. Wei found out that Miss Yuan's mother was someone's concubine and had been abandoned, but still received a few tens of dollars in allowance each month. Her mother was a smoker, and a mere few tens of dollars was certainly not enough for their expenses. So Wei discovered that the nephew they brought, was already her temporary son-in-law. Wei, who was in the love river of first love, his pain was of course an obvious fact, and we repeatedly advised him to leave A× – Miss Yuan's nickname – right? This kind of passive solution could not compensate for his pain in the slightest.</p>
<p>After this secret was revealed, everyone was embarrassed, and even more unexpected things happened on an evening when rain threads were drifting outside the window.</p>
<p>Wei then began to tell of his sudden change: "A×'s mother wanted to go to the Great World, but I declined because of the rainy weather; and X also said she had a headache and wouldn't go. After nine o'clock, I was preparing to go to bed when A× put on a silk gown and came to my room. She nestled in my arms, crying and telling me about her mother's misdeeds. Because she had no chance to tell me in detail, she loved me very much. Her behavior at this time was unexpectedly promiscuous. I suddenly woke up from my dream, pushed her away, ran out the door in the rain, two dark shadows were wandering at the back door, and at the same time I met her mother at the alley entrance."</p>
<p>Rain threads drifted outside the window, and this story ended in the sound of rain.</p>

<p>Shop Assistant Correspondence</p>
<h3>My Brother's Private Debt</h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>My brother, Dechu, married into the Chen family in 1928. Later, he raised funds to open a rice shop; due to bad friendships, he was out all day, squandering money like dirt. As a result, the shop suffered huge losses, and he also privately collected customer accounts. Now a creditor surnamed Yang has filed a lawsuit in February, and the court has held several hearings; the summons, etc., were received by the Chen family, but he has not appeared in court. Therefore, a default judgment was made, but my brother has been avoiding me. Yesterday, another summons came to the Chen family, but they did not accept it and brought it to me; but of course I refused. Afterwards, do I have any legal relationship? Please give me a suitable answer in the shop assistant correspondence column.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Wang Yicai</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>Editor's note: Our country's current laws stipulate that each individual is responsible for their own debts. According to the letter, your brother's debt to Yang is entirely his private debt. If you did not act as a guarantor at the time, you have absolutely no responsibility; not only you, but even the Chen family will not be involved. Even if your brother runs away, the court has its own remedies; it can issue an arrest warrant. Next time if another summons comes, you can simply write a note stating that it cannot be forwarded, and that's it.</p>
<p>Fiction</p>
<h3>Under the Traffic Light (5)</h3>
<p>— Xilin</p>
<p>(4) War is really annoying! Mr. Li, isn't it?</p>
<p>Two classmates who escaped the artillery fire from Jiangwan came to Mr. Li's room in the attic, with the purpose of temporarily taking refuge in Mr. Li's small house, but their emotions were excited by the war. As soon as he entered, the one surnamed Zhang, named Honglie, said indignantly:</p>
<p>"The Japanese dwarfs are too hateful, the city government authorities have humiliatingly accepted all their four unreasonable conditions, but they still violently launched an attack on Zhabei last night. You didn't go to see, the people of Zhabei didn't even have time to escape, China is too disappointing!" Another one, Zhou Shaoping, rushed to say:</p>
<p>"It's good now, it's good that the fight has started, the 19th Route Army has resolutely responded to the battle, China will either perish this time, or find a way out in this battle, I'm preparing our school to organize a volunteer army to automatically join the front line, Shi Qiao, you know many people, please help us!"</p>
<p>Although Li Shiqiao graduated from university two years ago, the life of long-term unemployment has fortunately not cooled down his youthful blood. He expressed twelve points of excitement about the excitement of Zhang and Zhou. At this time, the roaring planes circled in the air, and their blood boiled even more. The more excited he was, the more Shiqiao couldn't say a word. Zhou Shaoping rushed to say again:</p>
<p>"We'll leave first, first find a few like-minded classmates, otherwise they will all be scattered and it will not be easy to gather them. We will have to turn around and come here to sleep tonight, and Honglie and I will just spread out on the floor!"</p>
<p>"Come to my place? I'm moving, the second landlord wants me to move!" Shiqiao immediately said with a gloomy face in disappointment, this disappointment is not limited to the inability of the two classmates to come to sleep, and the two classmates have also inferred one or two when Shiqiao chatted, so they jokingly and truthfully said:</p>
<p>"The second landlord wants you to move? Your second landlady! But this is really unfortunate, today there is a war, the rent outside will definitely be doubled! Moving! It's really not easy!"</p>
<p>"I owe the second landlord money for two months, and they haven't asked me for it. I think the reason they want me to move is because of a rich old man who just rented in yesterday. They probably escaped from Zhabei to avoid the disaster. For a while, they couldn't find a good house, so they had to be the third tenant here! But they have money, give the second landlord more rent, and the White Russian will definitely tell me to move immediately, what to do!"</p>
<p>"People without money have to bow their heads, people with money are even more informed, they escaped yesterday, you have to negotiate with this tycoon well, this may be a way, tycoons are often hypocritical about small things. As for the two of us, it's good to borrow a place today, see you tomorrow!"</p>
<p>After Zhou and Zhang left, Li Shiqiao calculated how to talk to the tycoon alone. The attitude must be neither arrogant nor humble. The most important thing is not to make him despise him. He sorted out the set of blue serge suit he was wearing – this was his only nice clothes – and made the crease of his trousers clearer, so he walked up a few steps to the tycoon's house and knocked on the door.</p>

<h3>What is Sex Appeal? What is Sex Appeal</h3>
<p>— Yinxi</p>
<p>What is "sex appeal"?</p>
<p>Is it seductiveness? Is it a biological reaction or a chemical mixture? Why do some people have more and some have less? Is it a real, living thing, or a term created by Hollywood to sell movies? Can it be defined, or is it too empty to be explained? Is there a clear understanding of it, or is everyone just guessing?</p>
<p>Regarding the above questions, Hollywood's experts on sex appeal cannot agree. Readers, read this article, but judge based on your own views, the so-called wise men see wisdom, and benevolent men see benevolence. But sex appeal is the most important commodity in Hollywood, and Hollywood is famous for selling sex appeal. In the past, a woman had to be charming, attractive, emotional, and interested, but now she only has to pay attention to how to have SA, which is an abbreviation for sex appeal, and is extremely popular now. The same goes for men. If Clark Gable didn't have sex appeal, he could only do hard labor in a lumberyard; if Greta Garbo didn't have it, she could only be a waitress in a barbershop; if James Dolan didn't have it, he could only sell peanuts on the street.</p>
<p>Sex appeal and beauty, it can be said, are not very related. The most sexy stars in Hollywood are not particularly beautiful in appearance. Sex appeal and curves are also not very connected. For example, Greta Garbo, she has neither a moving face nor a slender curve, but she is extremely sexy. So what exactly is sex appeal?</p>
<p>Mom throws down the plates and cups and runs out to see James Cagney; Dad secretly opens the curtains and peeps at the billboard Mae West's name: This is all sex appeal.</p>
<p>Newton invented gravity; Elinor Glyn invented sex appeal. She gave Clara Bow a translated title, called It Girl. Then this (it) caused a sensation in the world and became all the rage. But I don't know which good apprentice sent "it" to school, where it received some higher education, and it became the current SA.</p>
<p>Famous director Beqian said, "Two plus two becomes four; but when it comes to sex appeal, it's not that easy. You meet someone, you fall in love with them, what's the reason? Think about it yourself. All I know is that if you need to do some business, you must have it. Whether you are an oil tycoon, a writer, or a street hero, you must have some sex appeal to be successful. Even a comedian, if he doesn't have sex appeal, he won't be a comedian. But if you have this sex appeal, you can't hide it no matter what. Some people say that Chevalier's sex appeal is in his voice. But who can say that his SA is not in his eyes, the movement of his hands, the way he walks, the way he pouts?"</p>
<p>So what exactly is sex appeal?</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Review of "A Modern Woman"</h3>
<p>— Jianan</p>
<p>Money, love, and excitement are what every so-called modern woman considers urgently needed. They desperately try for these many things, resulting in conflicts with the law and the destruction of morality. The final harvest is still emptiness. Miss Ai introduced this situation to us in her writing long ago. In this film, we have the same understanding.</p>
<p>Kisses are very common in imported films, but in domestic films, apart from a few unnatural hugs, the only hot actions are hints of black shadows in the white curtain. In this, Miss Ai's courage is indeed admirable.</p>
<p>Indeed, the director's skills throughout the play, the actors' seriousness, and the beauty of the scenes all show considerable progress, as this magazine and other film magazines have already praised. What I want to say now is a few other points.</p>
<p>The transfer of fallen women to the new path of "a vast sky and boundless sea" is the most important center of the entire play, but the latter part of this film seems too light. Except for once shaking the sock machine a few times at that time, the rest is replaced by subtitles for action, and the female revolutionaries who transformed her into a middleman are also only dialogue on the subtitles, as if they only remembered being on the stage and forgot that this was a movie.</p>
<p>Sun Min is most suitable for playing a playboy, so his success in this film is what it should be, but he originally represented a weak-willed youth, and finally even ignored the three letters sent by Tao Tao in prison, as if he was very strong-willed, but at the end he would become decadent, indulge in pleasure, and sink. This point seems contradictory.</p>
<p>There are also a few minor flaws, but these many are not very important minor points, and the success of the entire play will not be significantly affected.</p>
<h3>After Watching "A Modern Woman"</h3>
<p>— Xu Hairong</p>
<p>Among the domestically produced films, being able to write and star in a film by oneself, of course, we must count this "A Modern Woman".</p>
<p>Miss Ai Xia does have her own unique understanding of love, here she elucidates the true meaning of love, it turns out that the so-called love is such a meaningless thing, I think this film can be given to a group of love-crazy young men and women of the times as a refreshing powder.</p>
<p>Probably regarding the writing aspect, Miss Ai Xia does not yet have good experience, so this film has many defects and contradictions in the script. Tao Tao's sudden transformation is the place that makes us feel the most confused. However, we still feel joy, because Miss Ai Xia's spirit of hard work and progress in the cause of cinema movement in our country has at least won the unanimous sympathy of the audience. The director cannot satisfy us very much, there are many omissions, the arrangement of Tao Tao's family and the description of prison life are the most inappropriate. The scene of the "woman" is infinitely affectionate, all in silence, this film is scheduled to be released in Nanjing Grand Theater starting this Wednesday, you cannot find a male in this movie.</p>
<h3>After Seeing "A Modern Woman"</h3>
<p>— Yu Shuyu</p>
<p>As someone who loves domestically produced films like life itself, of course I wouldn't miss this "A Modern Woman," a screenplay written by a female actress herself. But after returning from seeing it, I was ultimately greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>According to an introduction written by the screenwriter, Ms. Ai Xia herself, the backbone of this screenplay is actually a portrayal of herself. Alright, regardless of whether this is true or not, I have some sentiments about this female star's past history.</p>
<p>If we put aside this issue, we can take another look at the content of the screenplay's development. Indeed, in general domestic films, the plot is always long, so the film can only develop one segment of the story and cannot pay attention to artistic development. This film is relatively good, because its plot is very short, giving the director and actors countless opportunities to exert their abilities to the fullest extent. Of course, Ai Xia gave herself particularly many opportunities to show off. Other various techniques have also shown significant progress.</p>
<p>However, the screenplay is too poetic, so it feels empty everywhere. The theme is even more timid and weak. The entire film writes too much about romance, so that in the end there is no way to turn things around to put the protagonist on the right path, and it can only end vaguely. This is clearly a problem of being top-heavy and bottom-light. Moreover, the naming is "A Modern Woman," but the play only portrays "A Modern Fallen Woman" and does not give her any way out. Although she has revolutionary thoughts after correcting herself, it is only an implication and some of it is not acted out in the play. Consciously, I also fully feel that she is incomplete and defective.</p>
<h3>What Exactly is There in "Women"?</h3>
<p>— Shen Weng</p>
<p>It is a record of human affairs</p>
<p>In the minds of a group of old-fashioned people in Germany, there is still a concept of "Prussian soldier," without any revolutionary thoughts. They believe that there will be a time when Germany will still need soldiers and soldiers' mothers; therefore, in many old and decadent female schools, all training methods are based on military discipline, only knowing to blindly oppress harshly, single-mindedly wanting to turn those little girls into "iron women," and the word emotion is absolutely untouchable. As a result, the liveliness and innocence of a group of little girls were all destroyed.</p>
<p>This famous film "Women" (original name "The Light of Women"), entirely acted by women, was filmed because of this issue. It is a record of human affairs, its advocacy is to unleash human nature and oppose that mechanical life. Its screenplay was written by a woman. In fact, only a woman can write such a story. Because she can understand the hearts of women, she can understand the suffering of women, and completely express the loyalty in the hearts of women around the world. Although she did not openly scold the old-fashioned German education; later, the suicide of the female student made the old-fashioned people feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Speaking of acting skills, of course there are many places that are worthy of praise. Among them, Dorothy Wieck's teacher and Hansa Schiarli's student's expressions are the most moving. They used inner performances to clearly reveal joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, making people excited and stimulated to the extreme. Her Sister Emily Ong's principal also did quite well. The many female students were also able to express their individual personalities. Looking at the situation in all aspects, the fact that this film was able to achieve unexpected success in Europe and the United States is certainly not a fluke.</p>
<h3>Hu Die's Expenses on Hair</h3>
<p>— Mo Ke Feng</p>
<p>Most stars are very extravagant, especially female stars. They think that a foot of clothing material for a few dollars and a pair of socks for dozens of dollars are nothing strange. It is not uncommon in the film industry for Xu Shuzhen to have socks for twenty-five gold! Now I tell you: Empress Hu Die's monthly expenses on haircuts alone must be more than thirty yuan.</p>
<h3>Film Novel Love Sea Reunion Reunion in Vienna (7)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zi Gui</p>
<p>"Elena, my darling," Rudolf pleaded, "It is not easy for you to obey me. You probably always think about the ring in my pocket. But on my side, it is completely different from being with others, can't you still understand? I loved you first, and you also loved me. I now ask you to love me again, truly one more time. I don't want to be a rival to your husband, but you can also love me a little more, like some echoes when you first experienced love." He was now sitting on the sofa, but still hugged Elena and refused to let go, "Why are you so stubborn? You seem to be still a naive girl student, grabbed by a hungry orangutan. Relax yourself a little, and be as unrestrained as before." Elena really laughed. But still very low.</p>
<p>"Aren't you asking me to be unrestrained for a while?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I am not asking you to pretend to perfunctorily me," Rudolf said uncomfortably.</p>
<p>She suddenly turned her body, leaned on him, hugged his head and kissed him desperately, just like Rudolf kissed her a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>"Huh, this is really unexpected."</p>
<p>"You didn't expect me to listen to you so quickly, did you?" She said, hitting his mouth madly again, and kissing him madly. He had already held her in his arms. She asked, "Am I still as cold as ice?"</p>
<p>"No, how is it that this ice melted so quickly?"</p>
<p>She kissed wildly, laughing wildly. She shouted, "Let me open all the doors and let them see that I haven't changed at all. Rudolf wanted to stop her, but she had already opened all the doors, and a group of old friends filed in, cheering and celebrating Elena standing on the table, which was a kind of her unrestrainedness back then. But a moment later, Rudolf had pulled her down from the table, and they hugged each other and floated into the bedroom in the music of the waltz.</p>
<p>The air outside was extremely tense. The group of people were madly fearless, and suddenly Rudolf rushed out of the bedroom, his face was flushed with rage, shouting, "Where did she go? Why are you standing there like fools? Go find her! Go chase her!"! He stomped his feet and said self-pityingly, "I shouldn't have let her go into the bathroom alone, I didn't expect her to escape like this!"</p>
<p>He decided to chase her himself. Old Lu warned him that there were police patrolling at the door. Many people begged him not to go, but he could not be stopped. He pulled his hat down to cover his eyes and rushed out in a coat. (To be continued)</p>
