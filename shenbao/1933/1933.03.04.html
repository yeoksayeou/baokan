<h3 id="c16">時評　美國新總統羅斯福就職　晦· <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>（一）　祝美國更新與中美國交永固</p>
<p>北美合衆國新總統羅斯福將於今日正式就職。入爲白宮主人。吾人回顧中美兩國已往之友誼。與羅斯福總統不變更前總統胡佛與國務長官史汀生之對外政策。對日本强佔東北。侵略熱河。尤具明悉見解。堅持不承認。［僞國］主議世界與論因以轉换。現在戰爭雖已開幕。而公道正義。亦因美國之支持而愈加有。力故吾人於羅斯福氏就新職之日。鞠誠恭祝美國繁興。中美國交永固。新總統羅斯福健康。</p>
<p>蓋美國自一九二九年以還。以世界經濟繁榮之重心。一變而爲世界經濟恐慌之焦點。設使美國而不能確定經濟的根本政策。不能恢復其已往繁榮者。則西歐各國。將更屬無望。共和黨總統胡佛在任時。雖曾蓋其最大努力。冀挽回其頽。運無如大勢所趨。回天無術。去年秋季。以一時之刺激。市面似趨好轉。而事過景遷。至十一月八日選舉以後。市面衰頽。仍如往昔。今年入春以來。尤少佳象。故吾人於致賀之餘。更不能不期望羅斯福氏奮勇努力。打開經濟的新局。越過當前難關而更生美國之繁榮。</p>
<p>中美兩國宿稱友善。一般華人對美。多具純潔好。感雖在美國國内。尚不免有若干人持有色人種之偏見。對東方之中國缺正確理解。然亦傷大體。倘再加有識者之努力。敢信中美友誼。必能歸於圓滿。由友誼而進樹國際間美亞兩洲黄白人種眞誠的互助合作。掃除當前人類之障碍。建立世界和平恒久之根基。</p>
<p>（二）　我國人對美國應有之認識</p>
<p>吾儕希冀美國如是遠大。祝賀美新總統前途如是眞誠。則反躬自問。更當奮勉努力。爲世界和平正羲貢其綿薄。而我國竟爲强寇所侵。凌徒以我國力。弱不免因循坐誤耳。而一般人尤存僥倖心理。企望列國以日破棄遠東均勢。而加以實力之制裁。自史汀生氏確定不承認武力侵略所得主張後。對美亦缺乏理解。故當此美國政局更新之際。我國人對美固當增進友誼。相互提携。而於美國内情。更須有較深切之認識。</p>
<p>第一吾人須認識美國於資本主義國家中。洵居最主要地位。金融資本産業組織。堪稱資本主義各國中之模範。然自經濟恐慌發生以來。其恐慌情勢。亦爲現世界之模範。國内市塲。以失業工人增加。一般大衆消費能力减退。難有迅速興起之望。國外市塲。則南美因農業恐慌。已形成政治紛亂。最低限之社會秩序。亦幾不易維持。市塲之開發。繁榮之增進。更無待論。遠東則自日本擾亂和平挑起戰爭以還。我國多數人民。救死不遑。何能增加購買能力。是以美國此時。不能不集其全力應付當前之金融風潮。圖社會之安定。而於日本之侵略東北。於熱河之被攻擊。止於與支援。道德的和平的勗勉而已。</p>
<p>第二吾人須認識英美兩國。究爲今日世界之兩雄。爭握世界領導權。勢所難免。緃令一時和洽。持久性究亦有限。矧關税壁壨森嚴。戰債問題。猶未解决乎。新總統羅斯福固曾提倡財政關税。主張解决戰債問題者。然美國經濟恐慌深化若此。欲圖穩渡難關。更須矯正已往之失。戰債與關税之合理解决。實爲當前之急務。故此時遠東戰爭之發展。恐亦無力顧及之也。</p>
<p>第三，須認識美國即使貫澈其初衷。各國又皆執行國聯决議。否認［滿洲｜傀儡｜國。］維持國際間公理正義。然國聯盟約第十六條之運用。以各國經濟利害關係之不同。見諸實行殆非易事。况日本在民界海運居第四位。尚能勉强助長其商業。而經濟絶交。非至短兵相接時。各國决不輕於採用。此刻又誰能爲［中國之公道］而犠牲其本身之利益耶。美國資本家與我雖甚友好。但亦不能不先顧自已生活。故吾國萬不可專待善憐之援助。而不自努力向上也。</p>
<p>（三）　中美提携</p>
<p>總之今日之事［力］爲。眞個人須用力。乃能在困苦中求生活。國空須用力。乃能獨立於世界。九一八事變到還。我國迄未用力。所用者亦僅外交上折衝之力，實際戰鬭之［力。］除去年上海一戰外。皆未嘗盡量發。揮而亂人遂得步進步。今且襲熱河而窺欒東矣。當此千鈞一髮危急存亡决於頃刻之際。奮力自强。猶未必能濟當前之厄。而况乎仍如從前之悠忽耶。</p>
<p>今日國際形勢。於日本固多不利。必須我國能公然應戰。且須鼓勇反攻。｜｜血肉之軀。雖未必能制勝槍砲。然我國有兵二百萬。如能善用我步兵狙擊之長。攻敵之短。最後勝利。必歸悲者。今欲盼望各國同情於我國家。作有力之援助。至少必須我中國能奮禦寇之［力。］表現其禦寇之决心。對於中美兩國之合作。亦必如是而始能有效。和平前途。始能奠基吾人於恭祝美國新總統就職之餘。尤不能不努力自勉。認定救中國亦即爲促進世界和平之唯一途。徑</p>

<p>春秋一些小意思  百合　　　　｜羅氏就戰的祝禮｜　　太　平洋西岸的那一個大國的民衆們，今大與高彩地，在萬方多難的空氣裏，簇擁着剌不死的新大總統羅斯福氏進白宮繼胡佛氏而爲元當。這一回事，莫説美國人處當歡欣鼓舞，就是我們遵在太平洋東岸，面皮黄黄恭候着做奴隸的中國人，也應當手之舞之，足之蹈之的在隔壁歡喜一下子。　　爲甚麽呢？呵，説來也眞幼積得可笑。日本人滿想從南滿路，吞我東北；苦祇苦一邊一個俄國，一邊一個美國監視着。因爲俄國是素有打俄帝國主義的口號的，美國是素在太平洋上稱霸的。所以日本人儘做着吞噬我東北的夢，鬼鬼崇崇的不敢動手，怕二面二個長人不答應。後來中國同俄國絶交了，美國正鬧着不景氣。無暇東顧，日本看正了中國孤立的一個好機會，猛不防當胸一拳，把我東北三省搶了去。這一來可激怒了俄國，急瓌了美國。但是天有不測風雲，十九擋如意算盤，終究是不容易打的。　震一聲，中俄復交了。今天又是力主美俄復交的羅斯福大總統就任了。而且羅斯福氏一再的引用條約尊嚴那句話，當然今後太平洋十的好處，現在祇好算跑龍套綫登塲。日本的併吞東北，尚還夜長夢多，我們多少總還有趁此機會，用别種方法，收回東北失地的三分希望咧。　　這種潤水裏摸魚的話兒、本來是不很大方的。可是今天因羅斯福大總統就職禁雀躍三百，樂而忘形，顧不了許多大膽地説出來了。這一些小意思，不像樣的，就算羅氏就職的祝禮能。善辯的無賴  妙神　　凡是善辯的無頼或惡棍，縱然他做了千錯萬錯的事，没有辯論的餘地；但他於無可辯論之中，還是要囂囂然的作［句彷佛是自慰般的烟幕彈，他强項而不平地説：［是非自有公論］！　　等到旁人出來判别是非，有了公論之後，他的巧辯的烟幕彈，却又改换了方式，他又故作鬰鬰地説：［總有水落石出之日］！　　等到事實大白，眞情已見，旁觀者對於這位巧辯的惡棍，已側目而視；但他却猶不氣餧。厚着面皮向大衆憤憤地説：［豈一手可掩盡天下耳目］？　　現在日本在國聯採取的外交手腕，就是以上的三段階級。想凡明白正義的人，誰都承認日本是國際間的無頼，國際間的惡棍。他以暴力奪了我們的東三省，他却説他是正當的行動，他是自衛，滿洲本來是他的生命線，他以這樣千錯萬錯的事，他對國際方面的宣傳，還以爲不錯，希望大家胡他的調，而在國聯方面還敢［像煞有介事］地説：［是非自有公論］。現在幸虧國際形勢，大家不能對日本胡調，國聯的報告晋已通過，對於日本的行爲，指斥爲破壞和平的暴行，於是日本知道第一步是失敗了，乃採行第二步計劃。日本説我們在滿洲如何經營，如何救民於水火，將來你們總可明白我們日本併吞滿洲是存的好心，所謂［總有水落石出之日］；如果這一步他又失敗了，這無疑的，要採取第三步了，我們且瞧着吧！女子口中的男子  睡蓮　　｜男子聽者｜　　男　子們閒談的時候，總愛牽及女子，那家女人長，那家女人短，那位密絲貌美，那個姑娘苗條，甚至肉麻得要命的話也會衝出口來。　　自號爲「時代化」的文學家，搖起筆幹兒來寫文章，便要拉上女人，他們說··「没有女人不生動。」··················　　對亭子間裏的文學家是要提防的，說不定以你爲藍本，寫進小說裏去。·················　　單個兒在寂靜得如　躺着的死蛇一般的街上走，便會有男子或前或後時左時右的尾隨你，一如你具有磁性把他緊緊吸住，你拐一個灣或横一條弄來避開他，他也會跟着你照樣做，更難堪的還時時進以游詞。···················假使你是孤零的一個兒到影戲院中去，那末你的四周就有男子們坐下來把你包圍着。你疲乏時，要想伏在前座的椅背上，前座的男子察覺了，必仰靠過來，你要仰靠自已的椅背，早已有後座的男子俯伏好了，那末你只好挺挺腰肢危坐着不能動彈。　　………………………　　今天改着件新衣服，或是换了一雙鞋，或是點了少許口紅，總之比昨天改樣些。那末男子們碰到你，便放出怪可怕的眼光，在你的身上死釘着，釘得你心中含憤，你臉上湧血。　　………………………大餅和麵包  柯定鑫　　｜各有不同的滋味｜　　在　繁華的上海，到處充滿着洋氣。單説吃的一項，以早上的點心來説，一般普通的人，大都喜歡咬着大餅。據説：　　［味道很不錯，又香｜芝蔴香，葱香；又鮮｜鹽味鮮，猪油鮮。］　　不錯的，吃過大餅的人，都有這樣的感覺。但是上面所説的大餅，别名呌做：［蟹壳黄］，因爲製大餅的技師如果手段高妙的話，把灑了芝蔴，烘進爐子的餅，祇消幾分鐘，就把它取出，那麽餅的顔色，又黄又嫩，眞個好鮮似蟹落鍋的色彩。放進嘴裏，好似酥迷迷地，實在是很有味呢！　　還有一種，狹長式的，俗名綫板餅，｜取其形似，是用麵層裹好了切斷，把它烘了賣給人家的。裏面没有什麽餡子，吃起來也别有風味，價錢和［蟹壳黄］一樣，在早晨辦公之前，吃它三個，包你把肚子可以維持到午飯時候。　　更有一種是圓形的，直徑大槪是五英时，這種却專爲一般苦力們製造的，因爲質料多，可以經餓些！　　不要看輕大餅，據説：［上海有一個擺大餅攤的，他的兒子已經在××大學畢了業呢！］　　××　××　××　　同是用麵粉做的，高一等的却呌它是麵包。它不過用外國酵粉發一發，做得長長的高高的，再烘上一烘，烘得剛好的時候拿起，包上一張蠟紙，印上一些字樣和圖案。據説：　　［這是科學化的麺包，是供給上等人吃的。］　　不過我想，麵包單獨的吃，遠不如人餅的有味。吃麺包要用果子醬，白塌油。出了本錢，還要上利，更不如大餅的簡捷爽快。　　每日早上非麵包不飽的朋友們！請你們吃吃大餅吧！你不見東北的國軍，不是大餅都没得咬嗎？大家省些錢來，使得大家都有大餅吃，那綫是對勁了。我最後祝頌一聲：［大餅萬歲！］長篇小説東北四連長  張根水　　第一回　推食殷勤偏邀貧女憶　　　　　　入門慷慨别具武夫雄　　一個冬天的下午，陰雲暗暗的，很有雪意。雖然並没有括風，但是長空裏那尖冷的空氣觸到人肌膚上，依然還如剌如割。一個窮苦人家的小院子裏，墻角頭傾潑積水的冰層，凍得恒有一尺多厚，這個太陽永不大照臨的地方，挨近了兩扇格子窗户。這格子窗户裏面自然也就增加了不少的寒氣。那格子窗户，糊了一層能隔冷氣的棉料紙，一絲風也不讓它透進去。但是中間有兩個小格子，却按着兩塊豆腐干大的破璃。這時，有人在那塊小玻璃裏，向外張望了一下，接着便道：媽，裱糊匠帶着傢伙走了，我們瞧瞧去，糊得怎麽樣了？又有人道：瞧什麽？我才不願意有這樣的街坊呢。人家闊，咱們窮，在一個大門裏，彼此天天比起來，敎人怪難受的。説畢，歎了一口氣。這説話的是母女倆。母親楊江氏五十附近年紀。女兒老姑娘，也二十歲了。伊們住在北平西郊海甸鎭，一所平房裏面，是以女工餬中的人家。伊們人口簡單，只在這平房前面，住了一個跨院。正院以前住了兩家買賣人，都搬走了，現在却有一個下級軍官，賃了這個院子，這時正忙於打掃裱糊，還有辦進來呢。江氏聽说有軍官搬了來，實在是不願意，但是這是房東的房子，房東愛賃給誰，就賃給誰，房客有什麽法子可以干涉人家，所以娘兒倆雖然坐在屋子裏做活，可是不住的惦記着那外院裏的情形，江氏坐在坑上低頭縫一件褂子，瘦削的臉上，架了舊式的老花眼鏡在鼻梁上，越是顯着伊形容憔悴。老姑娘將坑洞裏暖坑的小煤球爐子拖了出來，捧到外面屋子裏去添煤球。江氏道：就在裏面添罷，送到外面去做什麽？老姑娘道：在屋子裏添，你不怕薰着嗎？對門甘二爺説了，北京人眞是蠢，年年報上登着煤毒薰死人，可是年年還有人薰死。把爐子裏的煤燒紅了，再搬到屋子裏去，這也是很容易辦的事，不明白北京人爲什麽老是便不改過來。上海夜話半夜彌撒  張若谷　　一九三二年的嚴冬，大雨如注的聖诞之夜。　　全上海的跳舞塲，正散放紅錄紙條兒，和彩色汽球，穿夜禮服的靑年，正摟抱着半裸的禯裝艷抹女人，在淫蕩的音波中，醉狂般舞着。　　年夜十二點鐘了，天空飛下了一大批彩紙製的花冠………　　在離開這些歡樂聲塲的十公里外，是上海西區的徐家匯鎭。在幽靜黑暗的一個廣塲上，雨點打在冬靑樹的葉子上，發出抖簇的聲音。我一個人，滿身都是雨水，跟着一大　穿木屐打雨傘的男男女女，向着兩塊像墓碑似的天主堂鐘樓前進。當我舉起濺滿泥漿的一雙皮鞋，踏上雲岡石階，將走進峩特式建築的穹門時，天文台上敲着哀嗚鐘聲。　　在高大柱子的敎堂裏，三千多個男女信友，都靜穆跪在木製的跑凳上。祭壇上，點着六枝一丈多高的白蠟炬，十幾個着紅長袍短白衣的孩子，手裏提了香爐蠟炬，三個雙手合淎，穿金碧輝煌祭披的長鬚神父，魚贯而行，從更衣所走到鋪着厚地氈的祭壇中央，大風琴發出吼聲，耶穌聖誔的半夜彌撒禮開始了。　　銀髯白髮的神父，用拉丁文念完了古經新經。唱經台上，一羣小孩子跟着大風琴，歌唱着讚美歌：［聖嬰誕生白冷兮，白冷兮，歡樂上天與下地。……亞肋路亞！……亞肋路亞！］　　三千多個男女敎友，在歡樂的音樂和歌聲裏，都寂靜無聲，眼睛望着祭壇上，看神父行祭禮。年在十歲左右的小弟弟和小妹妹們，睜着烏溜溜的眼珠，露出天眞的笑，在看祭壇邊人造山洞裏，躺在馬槽中的嬰孩小耶穌像。　　香烟冉冉上升，神父舉揚聖體的時候，小鈴發出淸脆的聲音，三千多個男女敎友，都靜穆地匍伏下來，眼睛望了地，恭敬行禮，連氣都不敢呼吸。　　一小時候，三千多個男男女女，個個而現笑容，魚貫走出神聖莊嚴的敎堂，雨點愈下愈大，天文台敲出一下悠長的鐘聲。廣塲上只看見無數的傘羣在移動，躑躅的皮鞋，踏在泥濘和水窪裏，發出奇怪的音調。　　遠處，在那不夜都市的上海中心，送來一陣陣汽車聲音舞倦興盡的靑年男女，坐在軟綿綿的座墊上，回到他們温煖的安樂窖裏去了。　　在黑暗的祭壇邊，點着一盞黯淡的油燈，照着一尊嬰孩耶穌聖像，穿了一件小白長袍，無聲無語地獨自躺在馬槽裏。</p>

<p>自由談學生  玄　　五　四，五卅運動的時候，靑年學生眞乃出足了風頭。當時對於學生的看法，顯然有兩極羰：一是讚頌，讚頌之甚者大有希望學生把國家興衰巨任整個兒擔負了去的意思：又一是詛咒，詛咒之極致則爲痛哭流涕長太息於［國家不幸，乃有妖孽之學生。］　　後來，學生這一名號漸漸不受人注意；因爲據説國家大事倒底不能付託給靑年學子，仍須奔走革命數十年的老革命黨繼續努力才行。到了孫傳芳部下大刀隊在上海屠殺靑年那時候及其以後·學生這一名號就得到極頂。這時候一般人對於學生的看法也不同了：學生倒底不中用！　　然需瀋陽事變來了。三天工夫内，東北三淪於敵手。正當［不抵抗］呀，［鎭靜］呀，［聲訴國聯］呀。鬧得不亦樂乎的時，突然又以［學生運動來了］告警！南方的學生到首都請願，北方的學生也要南下。那種火拉拉熱惹惹的情形，委實呌人看了覺得比東北失陷還要嚴重些。但這時一般的批評却頗不美；這時的學生只落得了［狂躁妄動，被人利用］的惡名。即使是最寛恕的論調也以爲學生們成事不足，敗事有餘。一二八上海戰事以後，我親耳聽得一位老先生忿忿然　　都是學生鬧出來的！可是東洋兵來了，學生早又跑得精光，呌老百姓項罪　　這句話實在代表了許多可憐的忠厚人對於學生的批評。近來許多責備學生　要逃難的命令和與論實在骨子裏也就和上述某老先生的話一鼻孔出氣。他們不是抝學生有　　亂分子，就是把學生看成三頭六臂不怕刀槍的天人。　　似乎學生是智識分子，不是兵，這樣粗淺的事實，竟有許多人還不很慬！於是在這不憤］下面，學生這一名號又再度霉到極頂。［解放］與［保守］  川　　中華民國給我們一件頂頂大原功德無时的事，就是解放了女人的大門，解放的最後目的，並有在放大已裹的脚，而在提倡自然發育的天足。放脚姑娘終不免放爲過渡的人，解革後，美的標準，自然在天足的小女。這是無論那個新時代的人，都得承認的。　　隨着政體的轉换而改革的，還有一件値得道及的事，便是新文學運動。這種運動的過渡期，是以舊文言寫新思想。但我們所逹到的最後目的，便是不受形式限制的，自然流露的白話。不意在這新運動二十年後之今日，大家正待着一種有生命的新文學作品之出現，以完成我們的使命的時候，竟忽地有一重迷霧，蒙住了我們的新文擅。這就是現在一班新文人（？）的復古運動。除報紙外，讀得最多的雜誌，有許多都在用着之乎也者；即個人的專集，也有不少的舊詞與舊詩。這時，在業出的［詞人］（？）當中，有曾某其人者架覺一味復古之不當，因倡導所谓詞的解放運動。我是一個常識舊文學而最愛讀詞的人，惟不滿意他那種拘板的格調，現在曾某旣來解放，自然是應以打破詞排及韻脚爲最後目的，但曾某獨不出此，仍保留其古板的形式，單將其中一些富有詩意的詞藻，换上幾句駡娘的村言野語。這樣也稱解放，未免太笑話了。　　與解放的曾某齊名的，還有一位保守的［詞人］（？）。那是是什麽樓詞的作者章某。有余某其人者，曾在什麽茶話第一卷每一期上發表一篇讀書雜記，論到章某的什麽樓詞。余某説［中國詞的正統是李後主，他直傳到淸代的納蘭性德便絶止了。中國一般談詞的人，都特别看重這正統派。××樓詞自然是屬於正統派的。他恰恰是正統派的重現］。這話我也承認。章某確是繼納蘭性德而起的。若説納蘭是正統派，章某自然也是。讀者要不信。試看下面兩閣浪淘沙好了。　　　夜雨做成秋，恰上心頭，敎他珍重護風流。端的爲誰添病也？更爲誰羞？密意未曾休，密願難酬。珠簾四卷月當樓。暗憶歡期眞似夢，夢也須留。｜納蘭性德作。暮雨滴成愁，愁上心頭。一生煩惱爲風流。總是相思添病也，病也堪羞。人在短墻頭，私願難酬。夜深何事倚高樓？雪裏偕行渾似夢，夢也難留。｜章某作　　我們把以上二詞對照一讀，便知章某的的確確是屬於正統派的。因爲章某恐怕有失正統，所以不敢多更原詞的韻脚，甚坙字眼都不敢多改呢！　　陽秋按曰：曾某與章某原是［一邱之貉］；並無［解放］與［保守］之分，祇一樣以偷竊爲能事，不信祇看曾某將宋代万俟雅言的［何處是京華，暮雲遮］改作［何處是吾家，白雲遮］，而且自詡爲得意佳句，便知。所謂［詞的解放］專家  張夢麟　　記得辛克萊在他的［錢説話］一書裏，曾説過有這樣的話。他説美國遍地是黄金，只看你怎樣去拿。只要你在某一方面有名，戲塲就會請你出臺，電影公司就會請你攝影，於是你名也成了，利也得了。因此，現在的美國，就産生了一大羣名人。有獨泳海峽的名人，有跳舞跳得最久的名人，有吃東西吃得最多的名人，有喝水喝得最多的名人等等等等。　　黄金慾的支配，在我們中國，又何獨不然。可是我們中國，終究是文明古國。拿吃東西，喝水等等來成名人，這在我們有敎養的紳士看來，太不高尚。我們要成名人，就得從促進中國文化方面去想。於是近幾年來，就産生出什麽北歐文學專家，新俄文學專家，辛克萊專家等等等等。而最近且最新的出品，便是所謂［詞的解放運動］。大約這位首創者，不久也要成專家！不，已經成了專家了。聽説還可永傳不朽呢！可是不幸得很，人死之後，就有名，又怎樣去拿黄金呢！　　詞的解放，到底解放了什麽，我没福拜讀他們的［專號］，不甚知道。只在本刊上讀過陽秋先生恭錄的。首兩從這兩首看來，形式還在，韻脚也在，到底解放了什麽？用語嗎？我們來看看呢！這兩首裏，有［凄凉］，［紅妝］，［中原］［江南］等字，就起唐末詞人於地下，他們也不必要高唱詞的解放，然後能用這些字吧。　　可是，在這裏面，在［打打麻將］［管他娘］，這是以前的詞所未有的，大約這就是詞的解放了。哦，不錯，原來這些解放專家，專以［打打麻將］見長，呌他們來解放，他們就只會［管他娘］無怪老先生們要搖頭嘆息，説新思想甚于洪水猛獸了！　　寫到此地，我又想起我們最愛玩的這一套把戲。即是，把事做了，志找理由，我們無論做壞事好事，都找得出一個堂皇正大的藉口，來證明我們常是對的。所以你説那些詞的解放專家在［管他娘］，他們至少要和你拚命：但如果你説他們在［從事于詞的解放］，那末你這句話包管會被印在他的著書背後的所謂［好評一束］裏面。　　笑林廣記裏面，有段敎書先生放屁戳洞的帮故事。東家勸他放屁儘管放，何必刻板。這位東家，很富于理解，他知道放屁是内身所迫，不得不然，所以他决不説［你不可放屁］！　　我對於這些［專家］，也知道他們著作，是［内身所迫，不得不然］。所以他們要放儘管放，要傳之不朽，也儘管傳之不朽，我也不見，作者也看不見的。但是我對他們的忠告，便是，何必一定要［刻板］而且還美其名呌做［詞的解放］呢？　　陽秋按曰：曾某所謂［解放］之［放］，原即［放屁戳洞］之［放］也。蕭伯訥  朱湘神聖的丑角，望着這片故土，你的那雙老眼或許要奇怪，這麽奇特的一個中古時代，在搬演［秘斯特瑞］！或許也不…只湧現了儒家，道家的一幕於烟霧中；以及唐朝的光采；以及文化的［摩鋭抻提］，存在而没有生長，阻折了在中途。不多時，倦人的悲喜劇將有又一塲開演；牠的揮劇，你看…開閏在招手…那是狄司的門…雖説不如夢的迅速，與混沌我們却已經訣絶了，望着山，七級的，與天，九重的，在行走。　　二月末日黑女求神記（十七）  蕭伯納作　宜閑譯　　［你感覺到　　的顔色是鬧盈盈的；但是這實在同燕子的顔色一樣的没有　意，另外又一個女士説。　　［你犯不着回答這等詭辯］有權威的先生説。一這些是同三張紙牌的愛戲法一流的。我是外科醫生：我知道一個觀察明白的事實，就是輸血到女腦的血管的直徑比照着男腦血管的標準直徑，是過大的。因此所發生的充血是擾亂想像，也對想像過分剌戟的，這綫産出錯覺來，在這錯覺裏，胡椒，辣味暗示着熱，高间鍵的彈聲暗示着高，而却　的美艷暗示着鬧盈盈］。［你的學究的風度眞是了不得，獨克透，］第一呌先生説［但是這却離開了我所説的一點，我所説的是，無論太陽的熱是胡椒的熱呢，還是火熖的熱，月亮的冷是冰的一種冷呢，還勢利朋友對待窮親眷的一種冷，總之，太陽和月亮是正同地球一樣似乎住着生物的。］［地球上最冷的地方没有住着生物，］克洛凱爾先生説。［最熱的地方住着生物］第一個先生説。［如果地球上没有給我們在較適宜的氣候裏的多種便利呢，那是最冷的地方大約也會住着生物的。况且，南極帶就有着企鵝。太陽裏怎麽不會有火蝎的呢？那些相信着硫磺地獄的我們祖宗太太們知道她們所謂靈魂這東西，就是當身體死的時候離了那身體，而成爲生死的差異的這東西，是能够永遠生活在火熖裏的，在這一點上，她們是比這里我們朋友克洛凱爾科學化得多了。］　　［信地獄的人會信無論什麽道理，］克洛凱爾先生説，［甚矣於後天習惯的遺傳的。］　　［我想你信着進化論罷，克洛凱爾，算是旅行團裏的博物學者的一個先生説。　　［我是信着進化論，］克洛凱爾先生與奮地説。［你當我是根原主義者麽？］　　［如果你信進化論呢，］博物學者説，［你必須相信一切習惯是後天獲得兼且被遺傳的。然而你們血裏却都還有着伊甸園哩。你們這班人接受了新思想，而並未想到將舊思想抛掉，這一種辦法是使你們成爲公衆的危險的，你們都是澆着科學肥料的根原主義者。這所以你們在政治上是最愚笨的保守分子和反動分子，在科學本身上是最頑固的妨害分子了。每逢什麽開頭的時候，你們都有着一樣的見解：阻止牠罷，鞭打牠罷，絞死牠罷，炸掉牠罷，除滅牠罷。］　　［都是一樣的見解！］第一個女士嚷道。［他們曾經在什麽問題同意過麽？］　　［在現今，他們都望着一樣的方向，］帶着諷剌的表情的女士説。　　［什麽方向呢？］第一個女士説。　　［那個方向，］諷剌的女士指着黑女孩子説。　　　［你還在這裏？］第一個女士説。［我呌你去的！去］。　　黑女孩子没有回答。她瞪了眼深沈地向那女士看，讓［諾勃凱黎］在她的手指間擺温。隨卽向數學的女士看了一眼，説道，［這是什麽地方生起來的］？　　［什麽是什麽地方生起來的？］數學的女士説。　　［你説起的那種根，］黑女孩大説。［Ｍynas　Sex（買奈的性）的平方根。］　　［這是在心裏生起來的，］那女士説。［這是一個數。你能够從一數上去麽？］　　［一，二，三，四，五，是不是？］黑女孩子屈着指頭説。　　［正是，］那女士説。［再從一數向後邊去罷。］</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fierce Fighting on All Fronts in Rehe <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Battle of Lingyuan is Exceptionally Intense</p>
<p>Weng Zhaoyuan Arrives at the Front to Supervise the Battle</p>
<p>Our Army Takes Pingquan as the Military Center of Gravity in the Rear</p>
<p>Sun Dianying Telegraphs News of Victory on the Chifeng Front</p>
<p>Heavy Snow Between Pingquan and Rehe, Detailed Reports from the Front Not Yet Received Yesterday</p>
<p>(Beiping) The situation in Lingyuan is critical. Our side has successively dispatched reinforcements. Defensive works have been prepared in Pingquan, Lingnan, Jiukou, Chifeng, and other places. The enemy and our forces are currently engaged in fierce fighting in Jianchangyingzi, Chifeng. Cheng Guorui's rebel forces in Lingyuan and the Second Army of the puppet Jing'an Brigade have suffered setbacks and heavy losses. Pingquan has become our military center of gravity in the rear, with extremely solid fortifications. Therefore, although the situation in Chifeng and Lingyuan is urgent, there is no cause for concern in the rear. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde reports that the newly appointed commander of the 117th Division, Weng Zhaoyuan, has led his artillery forces to Lingyuan. Weng personally went to a certain location outside Lingyuan City to set up artillery positions, preparing to use heavy artillery to resist the enemy. Many of Weng's troops are veterans of the 19th Route Army. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying telegraphed that the enemy at Liangdian was completely annihilated after being surrounded and fiercely attacked by our army from all sides. Our army is now counterattacking Jianchangyingzi, Laoshui, Yuanbaolong, and the enemy at Cheshuipo. The enemy at Cheshuipo is the Motegi Cavalry Regiment, totaling about 8,000 men. The enemy at Cheshuipo was repelled by our army at 2:00 AM this morning. Lingyuan City was also bombed by Japanese artillery lines. Chifeng City and Wudan, among other places, suffered heavy losses. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Kuancheng states that fierce fighting continues near Lingyuan. Sun's brigade in Lingnan and Yu's brigade have joined forces into a single line. The Japanese army, advancing from Yaogou, is coordinating with the front-line Kawahara Regiment. The total number of Japanese troops is about 8,000, plus the puppet troops of Cheng Guorui and Yu Zhishan. At 3:00 PM on the 2nd, the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, and our army fought to the death to resist. Lingyuan City was also bombed by Japanese aircraft, turning the entire city into scorched earth. Fighting continued on the morning of the 3rd. Our army has a solid defensive position on the right flank of Pingquan, in Kuancheng. A certain brigade of reinforcements arrived in Pingquan at noon on the 2nd. Wan Fulin personally arrived near Pingquan on the morning of the 3rd to supervise the troops. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News: The Japanese army did not occupy Chifeng. A previous telegram stated that after the Shimenghua brigade of Sun Dianying's forces stationed in Chifeng reached an agreement with the Japanese army, the Japanese army's Motegi Brigade came to Chifeng. Shortly after arriving near Chifeng, the Shi Brigade suddenly counterattacked, routing the Japanese army and forcing them to retreat to Fangshendi, east of Chifeng. They then concentrated their forces and attacked again. At that time, a certain unit of the Righteous Army was entering Chifeng from a certain location, and the Japanese army followed them in. Sun's forces, because the Righteous Army was in front, dared not act. Seeing the Japanese army constructing fortifications, they launched a major attack on the Japanese army, resulting in the Japanese army's retreat. The fighting is still ongoing. The battle in Lingyuan is fierce. To the west of Lingyuan, our army's formal defensive line has not seen fierce fighting. The Japanese side in Yebaishou has opened reinforcements from Beipiao, totaling 30,000 men, and is confronting our certain three brigades. The Japanese army in Lingnan has temporarily ceased active operations due to repeated failed attacks, but there are still small-scale battles from time to time. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde states that at approximately 7:00 AM this morning, Dong Futing's troops engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy's Hayakawa Regiment in the Sanjiazi area. The intensity of the artillery fire was unprecedented. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy forces invading Lingnan are the Hayakawa Regiment. Yesterday afternoon, they made contact with our Dong Brigade in the Taipingfangzi area. The Kumamoto unit of the Japanese 6th Division has bypassed Laohushan and is advancing towards Damiao, joining forces with the Hayakawa unit to launch four fierce attacks on our positions. Brigade Commander Dong Futing personally commanded the front lines, fiercely retaliating. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This station received an official report from Rehe at 9:00 PM last night, stating that the Chinese army won a victory today. People from all walks of life are extremely pleased. It is said that at dusk today, the Chinese army launched a counterattack on Lingyuan, driving out the Japanese troops who had entered the city during the day. Currently, the Chinese army is vigorously defending Lingyuan, deploying defensive lines in preparation for the Japanese army's attack today. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday afternoon, the Righteous Army in Chifeng retreated in a very disorganized manner. The Japanese army took advantage of the situation to pursue them. Sun Dianying personally led troops to resist, repelling the enemy. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting near Chifeng. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chifeng states that Sun Dianying is directing the battle at the front, having joined forces with friendly troops. Yesterday afternoon, 600 to 700 enemies were discovered near the Caiyuanzi area in the east of the city, surrounded and disarmed by our forces. The Kurotani infantry unit shelled us for several hours but was eventually repelled. The Chifeng county seat is still within our defensive line. Tang has rushed to the county to assist in the battle. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde states that Yu's brigade has completely arrived at the Yebaishou defensive line and began fierce fighting with the Japanese army at 1:00 AM this morning. At the same time, there was fierce fighting in Taipingfang and Dayingsi, among other places. The situation is extremely tense. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde states that after Sun Dianying personally led three regiments of his troops in a counterattack from the Chifeng front on the morning of the 2nd, they successively recovered Cheshuipo and Jianchangyingzi, killing over 300 enemy Motegi cavalry, capturing over 200 prisoners, over 200 warhorses, and three machine guns and field guns each. Sun's troops, taking advantage of their victory, advanced in two routes and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in the Dahaladaokou and Huazitang areas. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At noon on the 2nd, three enemy bomber planes flew to Chifeng to bomb the city. A certain brigade of our Rehe army and Sun's troops are stationed in various locations outside the city. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There was heavy snow between Pingquan and Rehe on the 3rd, and telegram communications are slightly obstructed. Detailed and accurate reports from the front have not been received. However, our military center of gravity in the rear is now Pingquan, because the automobile road there is west to Chengde, north to Chifeng, northeast to Lingyuan, and southeast to Jiukou. The terrain is extremely strategic. Our army has constructed solid fortifications to the east of Pingquan, so there is no one concerned. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Sudden Cold Snap with Heavy Snow in Rehe <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) There is a sudden cold snap with heavy snow in Rehe. Many enemy soldiers have frozen to death. Heavy snow has also fallen in Zhangjiakou and Nankou on the Ping Sui Railway, and in Baoding on the Ping Han Railway. Yu En's Righteous Army ambushed the Japanese army in the Tiaohua Tu area, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Fierce Battle on the Lingnan Front <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) On the Lingnan front, at 4:00 AM on the 1st, our certain three units, totaling over 10,000 men, engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy's Yoneyama detachment, the Tanigi Regiment, and the puppet troops of Cheng Guorui, totaling over 30,000 men, and over ten enemy aircraft, in the Xiying Erdaoyingzi and Shazuizi areas. The enemy's deaths were more than double ours, making it the fiercest battle since the start of the Rehe War. Both Wan and Tang personally commanded and supervised the battle in a certain location between Lingyuan and Lingnan. Currently, Lingyuan County has been reduced to scorched earth. On the Chaoyang front, on the morning of the 2nd, over 10,000 enemy troops from the Japanese army's Hayakawa unit and over ten aircraft again fiercely attacked our Yebaishou and Hetaogou areas, among other places, but were repelled by our rear reinforcements, Yu Zhaolin's brigade, who arrived in time. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. On the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line, on the 2nd, a Japanese troop train carrying thousands of infantry soldiers arrived in Chaoyang to provide support and to invade our Jianping and Lanfeng areas.

<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde at 5:40 PM on the 3rd states that in the past two days, our army's fierce battle with the Japanese bandits in Lingyuan has been the most intense of the Rehe War. On the 2nd, when the Japanese bandits launched a full-scale invasion, our army slowly and safely withdrew its troops to the outskirts of Lingyuan, feigning defeat. The enemy fell into the trap, preparing to enter the city. As they approached the city walls, our ambush forces on all sides rose up, using obstacles and sharp weapons to cut off the enemy's retreat. The enemy panicked and fled in disarray. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue them, seizing countless spoils of war. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

On that day, the lieutenant was a platoon leader in the Yamaoka unit tasked with seizing a position. He wielded his sword and commanded his subordinates to advance. When crossing a Chinese army trench, he was unfortunately killed by a barrage of bullets. The squad leader immediately dismounted, embraced the lieutenant, and the lieutenant sternly ordered him to advance.

His determination to resist Japan remains unchanged. The traitor Zhang Hai Peng tempted this unit with profit, and we used his scheme against him, obtaining 200,000 yuan from the traitor and a certain amount of clothing, weapons, and ammunition.

<p>(Tianjin) Tang Yulin spoke to Chinese and foreign reporters in Chengde at noon on the 2nd, saying that since the September 18th Incident, Japan has occupied our three northeastern provinces and is still trying to cover the eyes and ears of the world with one hand. After the establishment of the puppet state, they claimed to the outside world that I am also a puppet state official, but in reality, I have never had any contact with the puppet state. After September 18th, I only knew to defend the territory and protect the people for the country. Japan is invading our territory, and I can only fight bravely to resist, to fulfill the duties of a soldier. Success or failure is not something to be considered. This time, the Japanese army is attacking Rehe, fabricating public opinion. In reality, our 30 million compatriots in the three northeastern provinces are under the oppression of power and are unwilling to be double slaves. They are eagerly awaiting the government to recover lost territory. This is the true intention of the people of the Northeast. Recalling when Japan destroyed Korea, they initially retained the prince's position, but soon destroyed the country. Today, Japan is supporting Pu Yi as a puppet ruler in the Northeast. I dare to assert that Pu's position will be completely destroyed within two years. Since we have a lesson to learn from the past, then when the Japanese bandits launch a large-scale attack on Rehe, our people and government nationwide should rise up together to resist the invaders. I have a responsibility to defend the territory, and I am determined to shed my blood and do my best to fight the Japanese bandits to the end. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chengde: A special Reuters correspondent visited Tang Yulin today. Tang admitted that he had just wanted to go to the front lines, but news came of Lingyuan being besieged. The situation there is very critical. Tang also said that he wants the world to know that he will fight to the end. The people of Rehe deeply hate the puppet Manchukuo and are willing to fight to resist. Furthermore, the Japanese troops who attacked the border of Chifeng have been repelled. Tang looked tired and haggard. After speaking with the Reuters correspondent, he set off for the front lines to supervise the battle. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Hu Jiesan, Sun Dianying's advisor, told reporters that Sun's army has three regiments in Chifeng. The front lines are manned by the Volunteers. A few days ago, the Volunteer units retreated one after another due to running out of ammunition, causing the enemy to approach the county seat. Sun ordered an advance towards the enemy at dawn on the 2nd, advancing fifty li by the evening of the 2nd and restoring the front line positions. The enemy on that front is the Motegi Cavalry Brigade and two infantry regiments. The office in Tianjin received a wireless message from Chifeng at 3:00 PM on the 3rd, stating that the talk of its loss is completely untrue. When Sun set out, he declared that he would dedicate his life to the country on this trip and was determined to resist Japan. Even if only one soldier remained, he would not retreat. The rumors of Sun's defection are even more absurd. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Yu Xuezhong Issues a Statement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to sources in diplomatic circles, the Japanese consul in Tianjin, citing the provisions of the 1902 exchange of notes on the return of Tianjin, has repeatedly demanded that Yu Xuezhong withdraw Chinese troops stationed there. It is reported that our government has recently instructed Yu to refute the demands based on reason. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong told reporters on the 3rd that the Japanese consul protested for the first time that our army's restoration of the Dagu forts violated the Boxer Protocol, intending to stir up the hearing of various countries. In fact, our army did not repair the Dagu forts, but only ordered troops to dig trenches in the Baihe River for drills. The Boxer Protocol does not allow the restoration of the forts, but it cannot prohibit the Chinese army from digging trenches for drills. Therefore, it was refuted. The second time, they protested that troops were stationed within twenty li of the city, which I considered unreasonable and would not respond to, because the troops discovered within twenty li of the city that the Japanese side referred to were troops passing through to other places, not permanent deployments, and therefore did not violate the treaty. The reporter asked if the Japanese side claimed that they would raise a severe protest again within a few days, with a deadline for reply, otherwise they would ask the consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, and other countries to jointly protest. Yu replied that if they come to jointly protest, it would be even easier to handle. I will definitely have sincere negotiations with the consuls. Please guarantee that the Japanese army will not cause trouble, and I will not make military deployments. Otherwise, Japan will violate the treaty and demand that we retreat, which is simply unreasonable. Yu also said that several hundred Japanese soldiers were frostbitten in Rehe, but they对外宣传 were said to have been injured by our army's poison gas, which is ridiculous. According to intelligence reports, the Japanese army transported a large number of poison gas to the border of Rehe. Their accusation of us releasing poison gas is likely a counter-propaganda tactic for their own plans to release poison gas. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Reuters learned from official sources tonight that the government has instructed Yu Xuezhong to reject Japan's demand that China not station troops in Tianjin based on the Boxer Rebellion Agreement. The fact that China has stationed troops in Tianjin is a long-standing practice and has never been opposed by the signatory countries. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) An earthquake occurred in Nanjing from 1:35:50 AM on the 3rd, lasting until 11:00 AM, with five tremors in succession, with a total tremor time of three hours and fifteen minutes. Aftershocks have continued to be detected. The first earthquake at 1:47 AM was particularly strong. According to reports from the Beijige Meteorological Institute, the location of the earthquake was approximately 2,670 kilometers from Nanjing, but the direction has not yet been accurately ascertained and may be within China's northwestern territory. Research is currently underway. The tremors were very strong, and there must have been significant damage at the source. One theory is that the cause of the tremors was passive, resulting from the impact of the earthquake in Japan. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Current Affairs Commentary: US President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Inauguration <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(1) Wishing the United States Renewal and Enduring Sino-US Friendship</p>
<p>US President Franklin D. Roosevelt will officially be inaugurated today, entering as master of the White House. As we review the past friendship between China and the United States, President Roosevelt does not change the foreign policy of former President Hoover and Secretary of State Stimson. He has a clear understanding of Japan's forceful occupation of the Northeast and invasion of Rehe, and insists on non-recognition. The puppet state's arguments, the world's views will therefore transform. Although war has now begun, justice and righteousness are strengthened by the support of the United States. Therefore, on the day of Mr. Roosevelt's inauguration, we sincerely wish the United States prosperity, enduring Sino-US friendship, and President Roosevelt good health.</p>
<p>Since 1929, the United States has changed from being the center of world economic prosperity to the focal point of world economic panic. If the United States cannot determine its fundamental economic policy and cannot restore its past prosperity, then the countries of Western Europe will be even more hopeless. While in office, Republican President Hoover made his greatest efforts, hoping to reverse this downward trend, but he was unable to reverse the inevitable trend of the times. Last autumn, due to temporary stimulation, the market seemed to be improving, but after the event passed, the market declined as before. Since the beginning of this spring, there have been few positive signs. Therefore, in addition to offering congratulations, we cannot help but hope that Mr. Roosevelt will bravely strive to open a new economic situation, overcome the current difficulties, and regenerate the prosperity of the United States.</p>
<p>China and the United States have long been known as friendly countries. The general Chinese populace has pure and good feelings towards the United States. Although there are inevitably some people within the United States who hold prejudices against colored races and lack a correct understanding of China in the East, this does not significantly affect the overall situation. If we add the efforts of insightful people, we dare to believe that Sino-US friendship will surely return to its fullness, leading from friendship to the establishment of sincere mutual assistance and cooperation between the yellow and white races of the two continents of America and Asia, removing the current obstacles to humanity, and establishing a lasting foundation for world peace.</p>
<p>(2) The Understanding That Our People Should Have of the United States</p>
<p>We hope for such greatness from the United States and sincerely congratulate the new US President's future. Therefore, when we examine ourselves, we should be even more diligent and strive to contribute our meager efforts to world peace and righteousness. Our country has been invaded by a powerful enemy, and our weakness is to blame. But ordinary people still hold a lucky mentality, hoping that the powers will abandon the balance of power in the Far East and impose practical sanctions. Since Mr. Stimson established the principle of not recognizing what is gained by military aggression, there has been a lack of understanding of the United States. Therefore, at this time of renewal in the American political situation, our people should strengthen friendship and cooperation with the United States, and we must have a deeper understanding of the internal situation of the United States.</p>
<p>First, we must recognize that the United States is indeed the most important position in the capitalist countries. Its financial capital and industrial organization can be called the model of capitalist countries. However, since the economic panic occurred, its panic situation has also become the model for the present world. Due to the increase in unemployed workers, the domestic market has a low hope of rapidly increasing the consuming ability of the general public. In foreign markets, South America has formed political chaos due to the agricultural panic. Even the minimum social order is difficult to maintain. There is no need to discuss the development and prosperity of the market. In the Far East, since Japan disrupted peace and provoked war, most of our people are too busy trying to save themselves. How can they increase purchasing power? Therefore, at this time, the United States cannot but focus all its efforts on coping with the current financial turmoil and seeking social stability, limiting the support with moral persuasion to Japan's invasion of the Northeast and attack on Rehe.</p>
<p>Second, we must recognize that the United Kingdom and the United States are, after all, the two powers of today's world, and the struggle to seize world leadership is inevitable. Even if they cooperate for a while, the sustainability is ultimately limited. Moreover, with stringent tariff barriers and the war debt problem not yet resolved. While new President Roosevelt has advocated financial tariffs and the resolution of the war debt problem, the depth of the economic panic in the United States requires a correction of past mistakes in order to tide over the difficulties. A rational solution to war debts and tariffs is the top priority at present. Therefore, the development of the Far East War at this time may also be unable to take into account.</p>
<p>Third, it is necessary to recognize that even if the United States implements its original intention and all countries implement the resolutions of the League of Nations, denying [Manchuria | Puppet | Country] and maintaining international justice and righteousness, the implementation of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant is difficult to put into practice due to the different economic interests of the countries. Moreover, Japan ranks fourth in the world in shipping, and can barely promote its commerce, and economic sanctions will not be lightly adopted by the countries until the time of direct combat. At this moment, who can sacrifice its own interests for [China's justice]? Although American capitalists are very friendly to me, they cannot but take care of their own lives first. Therefore, our country must never rely solely on benevolent assistance without striving for self-improvement.</p>
<p>(3) Sino-US Cooperation</p>
<p>In short, today's affairs require effort. Individuals must work hard to seek a living in hardships. Countries must work hard to stand independently in the world. Since the September 18th Incident, our country has not worked hard. What is used is only the power of diplomatic efforts, the [power] of actual combat, except for the battle in Shanghai last year, has never been fully exerted, and the rioters have made progress. Now, and now they are attacking Rehe and peering into eastern Hebei. At this critical moment when survival is decided in an instant, striving for self-improvement may not be able to save the current crisis, let alone be as casual as before.</p>
<p>Today's international situation is unfavorable to Japan. Our country must be able to publicly respond to the war, and we must encourage to counterattack. ｜｜ Although the flesh and blood may not be able to overcome guns and cannons, our country has 2 million soldiers. If we can make good use of the strengths of our infantry sniping and attack the enemy's weaknesses, the final victory will surely go to the mourners. If we want to hope that other countries will sympathize with our country and provide powerful assistance, at the very least, we must China can exert its force to resist the invaders and demonstrate its determination to resist the invaders. The cooperation between China and the United States will be effective only in this way. Then can the future of peace be established. In addition to congratulating the new President of the United States on his inauguration, we must work hard and encourage ourselves to recognize that saving China is the only way to promote world peace.</p>

<p>Wilson: Senator Thomas J. Walsh, the future Attorney General of the United States, died suddenly of a sudden illness last night on his way to Washington to assume office after his recent marriage. Regarding his successor, Senator Wheeler from Walsh's state is currently the most favored candidate. Following him are Governor Ritchie of Maryland and Peake, former Secretary of the Interior under President Wilson, both of whom also have the potential to succeed him. As for Walsh's cause of death, doctors who examined the body after the train arrived here concluded that it was either a sudden heart attack or a cerebral hemorrhage. His remains are still dressed in his wedding attire and will be transported to Washington, where a national funeral will be held on Saturday, the day of the new president's inauguration. Afterward, in accordance with his new wife's wishes, the body will be transported back to his hometown in Montana for burial. His new wife is a wealthy woman from a Cuban sugarcane plantation. Walsh hurriedly traveled to the Cuban capital to marry her just a week ago, anticipating a life of ultimate bliss with his new wife as he assumed office on the fourth of this month. Unexpectedly, his eagerness to travel led to his death on the train. According to his wife, her husband had felt unwell since arriving in the United States from Cuba, but he believed it was due to indigestion and did not pay attention to it. Furthermore, because the inauguration was imminent, he still hurried on his way, she said. (2nd National Telegraph)</p>

Today, Roosevelt announced the appointment of scientific agriculturalist Morganthau to reorganize the agency. This agency was the most criticized organization during President Hoover's administration. Before the reorganization, it is expected that the Grain Stabilization Corporation and Cotton Stabilization Corporation will be liquidated first, as major cotton and wheat-producing states are demanding the liquidation of these agencies. Roosevelt's intention in announcing this move today is to slightly reduce the panic of cotton and wheat-producing states regarding the financial crisis, thereby stabilizing public sentiment.

<h3 id="e23">Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The Epicenter is 200 Kilometers from Hokkaido</p>
<p>More Ferocious Than the Kanto Earthquake of Previous Years</p>
<p>The Northeastern Coastal Prefectures Have Suffered Significant Disasters</p>
<p>Giant Waves Swept Away Six-Foot-Tall Structures, Countless People and Animals Killed or Injured</p>
<p>▲ China United Press, Tokyo, 3rd: At 2:32:14 AM this morning, a major earthquake occurred in the Japanese prefectures of Hokkaido, Aomori, Akita, Yamagata, and Miyagi. Along the coast of the Tohoku region, giant waves over sixty feet high surged and crashed onto the shore. The entire town of Kamaishi was inundated, followed by a large fire that consumed over 300 houses. The flames are now soaring into the sky. In Aomori Prefecture, over 1,000 houses along the coast were swallowed by the tsunami. As of 9:45 AM this morning, the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs had received reports from various locations stating that in Iwaizumi, over 100 people were crushed to death and over 1,000 were injured, with hundreds missing, 800 houses collapsed, 1,000 houses washed away, and 300 houses burned. The Miyagi Prefecture government reported that as of 9:00 AM this morning, 17 deaths, 37 injuries, and over 100 missing persons had been confirmed. Earthquakes are still occurring in other locations. Due to the current focus on emergency relief efforts, detailed reports have not yet been sent to the central government. According to National Central Meteorological Observatory Technician Kokufu, this earthquake is more ferocious than the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923. Fortunately, because the epicenter is located 200 kilometers from Hokkaido, the damage on land is relatively light. Earthquake gauges at meteorological observatories across the country have all recorded the event. Even the weather station in Taiwan felt a slight tremor. There were also major tremors in Tokyo Prefecture, Nagano Prefecture, and Niigata Prefecture, where clocks stopped, but there were no human or animal casualties. The losses in the Tohoku prefectures and Hokkaido are expected to be severe. This station has now dispatched two technicians to the scene to investigate. The Japanese Navy has also ordered the Kasumigaura Air Group to urgently dispatch six seaplanes and six destroyers from the Second and Sixth Destroyer Divisions to Sendai and other locations for emergency relief.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd: At 2:30 AM this morning, Tokyo suddenly felt a very strong earthquake that lasted for quite some time, causing great alarm among the people. Although Tokyo only suffered minor damage, 1,500 houses in Kamaishi and Iwate were swept away by the tsunami that followed the earthquake. According to investigations, Kamaishi was the worst affected, and many towns and villages along the coast of Hokkaido also suffered the same fate. The houses were either destroyed by the earthquake or swept away by the tsunami.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd: Japan was hit by a very strong earthquake this morning, causing significant loss of life and property in several locations. It is now believed that the epicenter of the earthquake was located on Kinkasan Island, east of Matsushima. Matsushima is one of the three most famous scenic spots in Japan. In 1896, Kinkasan Island experienced a tsunami that devastated the northeastern coast, killing 30,000 people. Today's tsunami occurred 40 minutes after the earthquake and was approximately 4 to 10 feet high. The northeastern coast, which is 300 miles long, was completely affected. The affected area stretches from Ishinomaki, east of Matsushima, to Shiriyazaki at the northernmost tip of the island, and even Hokkaido was affected. The place with the most casualties from the earthquake was Omoto, where over 100 people died. Casualties in other places ranged from a few to dozens. The number of houses destroyed and fishing boats sunk is countless. After the disaster reports were received, officials immediately organized rescue teams and dispatched warships to patrol the coast to rescue any survivors who had fallen into the sea.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Report from the Meteorological Observatory <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>▲ Nippon Dempo, Tokyo, 3rd: The Central Meteorological Observatory announced that an earthquake occurred at 2:32:14 AM on the 3rd. The maximum amplitude was 40 millimeters. The nature of the earthquake was slow, and the epicenter was near Shioyazaki in Fukushima Prefecture. Strong tremors were felt in Aomori and the Kanto region.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 3rd: Regarding the earthquake in the Tohoku region, Director Okada of the Central Meteorological Observatory said, "Because the epicenter of this earthquake was in the sea, it was affected by the tsunami. The impact at sea is probably unclear, but areas with shallow waters or inlets should have suffered considerable damage. If the epicenter of this earthquake had been on land, the damage would have been more severe than the Great Kanto Earthquake. Its being in the sea is truly a stroke of good fortune amidst misfortune."</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 2nd: The seismograph at the West Bromwich Observatory indicated that there was a major earthquake 6,000 miles away at 5:43 PM today. It continued until 9:00 PM. The force of the earthquake was so great that the stylus of the instrument came loose from its socket, preventing a complete record from being obtained. According to Mr. Shaw, the observatory's director, this was the largest earthquake he had experienced in his 28 years.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Affecting the Morale of the Invasion of Rehe Forces <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>▲ China United Press, Tokyo, 3rd: Because the major disaster area of this earthquake is in the prefectures of Iwate, Aomori, Akita, and Hokkaido, and it is closely related to the soldiers of the advance units invading Rehe, the Japanese military is particularly anxious about this. It is reported that the top leaders of the General Staff Headquarters will convene a meeting in the near future to discuss post-disaster policies so that the morale of the troops invading Rehe is not affected. The relationship between the invading Rehe forces and the earthquake disaster area is as follows: The Kawara unit of the 8th Division has members from Akita Prefecture, the Ichinose unit has members from Iwate Prefecture, and the Hattori and Tani units of the 7th Division both belong to the Hokkaido region.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd: The earthquake, fire, and tsunami that struck the 300-mile stretch of the northeastern coast of Japan facing the Pacific Ocean simultaneously have created a scene of terrible devastation. The residents of this area are mostly fishermen and are known to be strong and resilient. Many of the victims have sons or brothers serving in Manchuria. A certain division that had recently returned from Manchuria, where they had built up a record of accomplishments, recruited many of its soldiers from this disaster-stricken area. A portion of the Hirozaki Division, which is currently fighting in Rehe, was also recruited from this area.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd: The details of the earthquake have not yet been reported by eyewitnesses, but based on the existing simple messages, it seems that the residents have not forgotten the tragic earthquake and tsunami that occurred there in 1896. They knew that a tsunami might follow after the earthquake and took refuge inland. Otherwise, the number of deaths and injuries would certainly have been more than this. When the waves surged and swept into the villages, most of the residents had already fled elsewhere and did not see their homes being destroyed. The waves rose like mountains collapsing, and the speed was like that of a special express train, striking the coast with a sound like thunder. Several rural villages were completely flattened, and not a single one of the hundreds of fishing boats remained intact. After the disaster reports were received, officials immediately organized rescue teams to depart and dispatched warships to patrol the coast to rescue those who had fallen into the sea but had not died.</p>
<p>▲ Iwate Prefecture: (Tokyo) At 2:30 AM this morning, a strong earthquake occurred in the Tohoku and Kanto regions. Subsequently, large waves struck the Pacific coast of the Tohoku region.

However, at 8:30 AM this morning, there were signs of another tsunami, and all residents of the coastal areas were mobilized for alert.

The content of the withdrawal notification is generally as follows: The Japanese government, based on Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, hereby notifies its withdrawal from the League of Nations. However, even after reaching the time of withdrawal, the Japanese government still truly cares about ensuring international peace, faithfully respects and fulfills its obligations under international treaties, and does not change its existing foreign policy, as it hereby declares. The draft of the statement of reasons for withdrawal has not been decided, but without being restricted by legal theory, it will point out the defects in the League of Nations' structure from a policy perspective.

It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Simon's speech in Parliament contained some points unfavorable to us, which have not been disclosed by the newspapers. The government has instructed the embassy in Britain to negotiate.

<p>Chairman Chiang Plans to Go to the Front to Supervise the Suppression</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Because Chiang's forces advanced directly from eastern Jiangxi to the bandits' capital, and Guangdong troops took Xingguo and Yudu, and Cai of Fujian also ordered his subordinates to leave Changting and attack Ruijin, besides concentrating the main force in the dangerous mountains of Ningdu and Xingguo, the puppet central government moved from Ruijin to Huichang. Huichang is easier to defend as it has no National Army near Xunwu, Anyuan, and Yudu. The puppet central government issued twenty orders to transfer the puppet independent Third Division from southern Fujian, and two thousand men and rifles from the puppet Huichang Independent Regiment, to Qingkeng Shangping from southern Fujian, to construct fortifications. Two hundred bandits were found in An Yuan Bantintang Qizhai, and four hundred bandits also arrived at Xunwu Shipai Shiliu, as evidence of the communist bandits' southward movement. (3rd Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) Chiang, with military and political arrangements underway, and the situation in Rehe becoming increasingly urgent, should conclude the bandit suppression campaign in a short period and focus all efforts on resisting Japan. He has decided to go to the front line to command within days, defeat the main force of the bandits, and after bringing it to an end, return to Nanjing and go north, which can be realized.

<p>50 Million People Affected by Payment Suspensions Nationwide</p>
<p>All Hoping the New President Will Find Ways to Stabilize Public Confidence</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, New York, 2nd: The number of states in the United States that have declared bank holidays has now increased to 18, affecting more than 50 million people. Several states, including Texas, also announced bank closures today. The duration of the holidays varies, with some lasting only four days and others lasting as long as fifteen days.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 2nd: At a time when banks in 18 states are strictly restricting business operations, and the Oakland Securities Cotton Exchange and the San Francisco Securities Exchange have suspended trading, the financial community and general depositors are eagerly awaiting President-elect Roosevelt to issue a statement to stabilize public confidence. However, Roosevelt remained silent today, only for the entire country to circulate that he would address the bank crisis in his inaugural speech on Saturday. It is said that Roosevelt's silence at this time is entirely out of respect for President Hoover, as he does not wish to embarrass him on the day he is about to leave office. Roosevelt also discussed this matter with the new Treasury Secretary Woodin today, and the banking communities of New York, Boston, and Chicago all believe that Roosevelt will attempt to stabilize public panic in his inaugural speech. The severity of the financial crisis has reached a point where no one dares to disregard it. A prominent American banker stated today that the difficulty lies in restoring public trust. The current nationwide bank runs by depositors are severely harming their own interests. Several other bankers also believe that if public panic does not subside, it will be necessary to suspend payments nationwide. The New York Federal Reserve Bank increased its discount rate to 3% today to deter speculators. Arizona and Nevada also ordered banks to close for five days, and Utah ordered banks to close for four days. The legislative assemblies of Wyoming, Minnesota, and Nebraska have all passed various bank protection plans. However, according to telegrams received by the Treasury Department, the public's panic seems to have slightly subsided, and restrictions on withdrawals have been sufficient to cope with the situation. It is heard that Oakland banks will reopen on Monday, and California banks are expected to do the same, with only slight restrictions.</p>

There is widespread speculation that the conference may inevitably face another indefinite postponement. Various parties are now considering reconvening the Five-Power Conference to inject new life into disarmament. The British representative, Eden, has returned to London to consult with his government on whether an invitation to the Five-Power Conference can be issued immediately after the new American president takes office. The Political Committee, which has been suspended for a long time, reconvened today to discuss the draft declaration of the European Security Formula, which states that European countries may no longer use force as a means of resolving disputes. All non-European countries have unanimously criticized this draft. The Soviet Union and Turkey do not approve of this draft because it is limited to Europe. Other non-European countries, such as China, Afghanistan, and Persia, believe that it only includes European countries and will also vote against it if it is not expanded. Later, at Henderson's suggestion, the issue of whether this draft should include countries outside of Europe was temporarily reserved for future discussion.</p>

<p>Causing Reactions from the Soviet Union</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Geneva, 3rd: The Russian delegation to the Disarmament Conference is concerned about the increasingly clear anti-Russian attitude of German Chancellor Hitler after taking office. Two Russian representatives stated that Hitler's radio broadcast last night not only fiercely attacked Marxism and Communism, but also wantonly criticized the Soviet government. This diplomatic approach by the German government poses a danger of provoking international disputes and is particularly harmful to the Disarmament Conference. The Russian representatives expressed their dissatisfaction and did not shy away from stating it.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 2nd: German Chancellor Hitler delivered a speech in the largest venue here tonight, vehemently denouncing Bolshevism as the greatest danger in the world, pointing out that Marxism, Bolshevism, pacifism, and internationalism will eventually lead to collapse and destruction. The Soviet Union, ruled by Marxism, has not alleviated its poverty. The country should be the granary of the world, but millions of people are still starving. The major cities are decreasing in population daily, and the people of the world are not as abused and living in terror as the Russians today. Germany is facing the same fate, and it is only a matter of time. If the weak middle class is willing to submit to Marxism, then only the current nationalist government and its loyal followers can take on the important task of saving Germany from collapse.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 3rd: Hitler's speech denouncing Communism and the current situation in Russia has been telegraphed in full to Moscow by the Russian ambassador for instructions.

<p>Committing Seppuku for Saito and Araki</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd – This morning, two members of a reactionary group, due to the failure to oppose the government's handling of a certain tax case, carried out [seppuku]. One simultaneously disemboweled himself in front of Prime Minister Saito's residence, and the other in front of War Minister Araki's residence. However, it is believed that they will both recover. Recently, members of the reactionary group had been on a lengthy hunger strike over this matter.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 3rd – Fujiyoshi Otoko committed suicide by stabbing himself in the abdomen at the Prime Minister's official residence. Simultaneously, Nanjo Gisei, traveling by car to War Minister Araki's official residence, committed seppuku in the reception room of the official residence. He will require approximately ten days of treatment. His motive for the self-disembowelment was indignation that the established political parties were colluding with the financial cliques, leading to the subversion of the nation. He wished to provoke reflection by War Minister Araki, whom he considered loyal and devoted to the country. Araki, deeply aware of his sincerity, but recognizing that these were extraordinary times following the withdrawal from the League of Nations, advised him that as fellow Japanese, they should not be in opposition.</p>

<p>Unearthing a Huge Hoard of Buried Treasure</p>
<p>Belonging to the Former Russian Second Army</p>
<p>▲ Guomin, Warsaw, 2nd – A villager near Vilna, Poland, recently unearthed a large quantity of gold coins, which are gold rubles from the Soviet Russian era, totaling one million yuan. According to investigations, these gold coins belonged to the former Russian Second Army. In 1914, this army was defeated by the German army led by Hindenburg, resulting in the destruction of the entire army. The commander, Samsonov, committed suicide. His subordinates, fearing that the large sum of money would fall into the hands of the German army, buried it underground. Unexpectedly, it sees the light of day again today.</p>

<p>Finance Minister Takahashi Deeply Fears Difficulty in Continuing the Budget</p>
<p>Baron Go Bitterly Complains That the Future Will Fall Into Great Disorder</p>
<p>Araki Says Disorder of Thought is Worse Than Economic Problems</p>
<p>The North China Daily News, Tokyo Correspondence, February 21st, says: Since Japan's undeclared war against China, its financial position has steadily deteriorated. Government leaders and those in high positions in the business community still regard this as a source of endless worry. The current cabinet has held several meetings to address this difficult issue. At the most recent meeting, War Minister Araki expressed his concern about the nation's financial policy, urging the government to formulate a stable financial plan as soon as possible. Araki did not approve of the current method of borrowing to make up for the shortage of national tax revenue, saying that this policy would lead the country to financial bankruptcy. Prime Minister Saito and Finance Minister Takahashi, without waiting for Araki to sit down, immediately rose to their feet simultaneously. Takahashi hastily bowed respectfully to Saito, saying that he was unaware that the Prime Minister also wished to speak and was extremely sorry. Saito also bowed to Takahashi, thanking him for his humility. Then Takahashi, fixing his gaze on Araki, detailed the expenses of the Manchurian Incident and its subsequent events, which had become a very large item in the budget and showed no sign of ending. He also said that today, there is no other way than to acknowledge that Japan will still have the same expenses in the coming years. In the future, when drafting the financial plan, this point should be firmly kept in mind.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Baron Go, chairman of the Japan Economic Federation, gave a speech at a certain banquet, describing the serious situation of Japan's economy and finances. The banquet was held behind closed doors, but the details were leaked and published in newspapers. It is said that Baron Go first asked the listeners to forgive his bluntness, but he believed that the listeners would be able to discern the true meaning and main points of his words. He continued that the soaring national expenditure and the falling exchange rate of the yen had caused the opportunity to secure Japan's economic structure to be lost. The unrestricted issuance of banknotes would lead to inflation. He feared that Japan's economic position would fall into the same great disorder as Germany after the war. The most important thing today is to immediately seriously consider the nation's financial and economic future. As for the signs of a turning point currently revealed in the financial world, this is entirely due to the activities of military demand trade and the circulation of funds to aid farmers. This kind of relief plan is certainly welcomed in the financial world, but ultimately, it will cause the nation's finances to become distorted. Baron Go finally criticized this year's budget, saying that half of it was military spending. Even if this money must be used, it is all unproductive. At this point, War Minister Araki, who was also present, stood up and angrily rebuked him, saying that the real danger to the country today is not in the economy or finances, but in the disorder of the people's thoughts. This must be stopped at any cost. The importance of this kind of issue far exceeds merely industrial or commercial issues, especially due to the manifestations of the anti-capitalist movement. The whole country must be prepared to deal with this kind of movement, and so on.</p>

<p>(Armed Landing Planned)</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since the Rehe war, the Japanese fleet has taken the opportunity to come to various ports along our country's coast to wantonly demonstrate its power. There have been reports recently of a dispatch of a fleet to Qingdao. It is said that this comes from a petition from Japanese residents in Qingdao to the Japanese consulate. The Japanese consul, following the request of the Japanese residents, has taken this action. The Japanese consul has also reported to the municipal government that when the Japanese fleet comes to Qingdao, it will send 1,500 officers and soldiers to land with arms to protect the overseas Chinese. It is reported that the municipal government has sternly refused. However, the Japanese residents, hearing that the Japanese fleet will be arriving soon, are all excited and have prepared to hold a grand welcome ceremony. Furthermore, the Japanese consulate in Qingdao yesterday sent personnel to the municipal government to claim that since the Rehe issue arose, the feelings of the people of the two countries have inevitably been stimulated. This consulate has paid close attention and has advised the overseas Chinese not to cause trouble in order to maintain permanent peace. They have come to ask the noble government for its opinion, and so on. The municipal government sent personnel to the consulate to reply, stating that since the mayor took office, he has made it his aim to maintain public order and seek the peaceful and happy life of both Chinese and foreigners. At a time when the current situation is tense, the public order of this city is of the utmost importance. This government will still adhere to this aim and do its utmost to maintain it so that Chinese and foreign residents can continue to live in peace as usual. Since your consulate has advised the overseas Chinese to remain calm, the public order of this city will naturally be free from worry, and so on. (March 1st)</p>

<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen drafted the Silver Standard Coinage Act and the Conversion Rate Calculation Method and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for deliberation. They were passed by the 89th Yuan Meeting and sent to the Central Political Council. The Central Political Council discussed them at its 346th meeting and resolved to approve them in principle, handing them over to the Legislative Yuan for speedy review. On the 3rd, the Legislative Yuan's seventh meeting presented them for discussion. The Ministry of Finance sent Xu Kan, Director of the Coinage Department, to attend and explain. The committee members raised many questions about the minting costs and minting aspects of the original draft. After Xu answered them one by one, they began to discuss it clause by clause and then resolved to amend and pass it, deleting the original Article 15. The Act and the Conversion Rate Calculation Method proposed by the Ministry of Finance are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Silver Standard Coinage Act) Article 1: The minting of silver standard coins is exclusively reserved for the Central Mint. Article 2: The silver standard coin is named "Yuan," with a total weight of 26.6971 grams, 88% silver, and 12% copper, containing 23.493448 grams of pure silver. Article 3: The design of the silver standard coin shall be drafted by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the National Government for promulgation by order. Article 4: One silver standard coin is calculated as 100 cents, and one cent is equal to 10 li. Article 5: The tolerance for the weight of each silver standard coin compared to the legal weight shall not exceed three parts per thousand. Article 6: The tolerance for the total weight of every 1,000 silver standard coins compared to the legal weight shall not exceed three parts per ten thousand. Article 7: The tolerance for the fineness of each silver standard coin compared to the legal fineness shall not exceed three parts per thousand. Article 8: The acceptance and delivery of silver standard coins for all public and private funds and all transactions shall have no limit on the amount each time. Article 9: Old one-yuan silver coins that meet the original specified weight and fineness may be used in the same way as silver standard coins within a certain period. The term of the preceding clause shall be determined by the Ministry of Finance by order. Article 10: Silver standard coins that have been used for too long may be sent to the Central Mint for exchange for new coins of the same value, but their weight and fineness shall still be the same as Articles 2, 5, 6, and 7 of this Act. Article 11: Those who request the Central Mint to mint silver standard coins on their behalf with silver materials suitable for minting or old silver coins shall follow the provisions of the following clauses: (1) For silver materials with a fineness of 999 per thousand, 23.493448 grams of pure silver shall be paid per yuan, plus a minting fee of 2.25% of one yuan. (2) Old one-yuan silver coins that meet the original specified weight and fineness shall be exchanged for the same amount of silver standard coins, exempting the minting fee. (3) For silver materials with a fineness of less than 999 per thousand, or old silver coins that do not meet the original specified weight and fineness, the actual amount of pure silver contained shall be declared per yuan, plus a minting fee of 2.25% of one yuan. If the silver materials or silver coins in the preceding clause are too impure, in addition to paying the minting fee, a refining fee may be added as appropriate. Article 12: The Central Mint may cast factory bars with a fineness of 999 per thousand. The weight of each bar shall be equal to the amount of pure silver contained in 1,000 silver standard coins and shall be marked on its face.

(2) For silver materials with a fineness of less than 999 per thousand, a minting fee of 2.25% shall be paid for each bar calculated according to the actual amount of pure silver obtained from refining, and a refining fee may be added as appropriate. Article 14: Those who exchange silver standard coins for Central Mint bars from the Central Mint shall be exchanged by the Central Mint for the number of silver standard coins indicated on each bar if their weight and fineness are consistent with the original state. Otherwise, they shall be exchanged according to the actual amount. Article 15: This Act shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Conversion Rate Calculation Method <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>One silver standard coin = 23.493448 grams of pure silver, one Shanghai tael of silver is equivalent to 33.599 grams of pure silver, 23.93449 grams % 33.59 = 10.6992305, one silver standard coin = Shanghai tael (pure silver) .6992305, plus minting fee 2/4% = Shanghai tael (pure silver) .0157327, one silver standard coin = Shanghai tael (pure silver) .715.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Original Proposal from the Ministry of Finance <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>[Regarding the matter of the proposal: The chaos of our country's currency system has long been criticized by the world. We urgently need to thoroughly reform it in order to benefit the country and the people. In the past, experts were hired to jointly study the matter. Originally, we wanted to gradually implement the gold standard system in order to conform to the world trend and benefit foreign trade. However, in recent years, looking around at the global economic situation, the decline has become more and more serious. Our country is also suffering from foreign insults, and financial matters should strive for stability and should not be changed too much. We have no choice but to start with unifying silver coins in order to establish the foundation of the silver standard. Therefore, a few months ago, we convened leaders from all walks of life to study the abolition of the tael. Although everyone had different positions and advocated different degrees of urgency, the opinion that the use of the tael should be abolished was generally agreed upon. Ziwen considered this again and again, believing that the custom of using the tael has been around for too long. If we want to achieve the goal of abolition, we must divide the steps and gradually implement them so that the public can know the convenience of abolishing the tael and not feel the pain of reform. The so-called "taking advantage of the situation" may achieve twice the result with half the effort. Shanghai is the financial center of the country and is also the focus of attention both at home and abroad. We plan to set the commonly used silver tael in the Shanghai market and the one-yuan silver coin circulating in the market as a standard yuan of seven mace, one fen, and five li, equivalent to one silver coin, as a fixed conversion rate. It will be implemented first from March 10th of this year. All public and private funds and all transactions shall be received and paid in silver coins at this fixed rate. At the same time, the Silver Standard Coinage Act shall be promulgated, and the Central Mint shall start minting according to it in order to show great trust and provide for circulation. Hereby, we respectfully submit the draft of the Silver Standard Coinage Act in sixteen articles for public resolution and then forward it to the Central Political Council for deliberation and implementation. This is the first step in preparing to abolish the tael and unify silver coins. It has already been agreed upon by the silver and money industry and leaders from all walks of life, and we have sent letters to the Central, China, and Communications Banks to form an exchange organization with the Central Bank as the main body, to detail the implementation methods. After implementation, there will be no obstacles to supply and demand, and the market can be as usual. Furthermore, there is more to clarify: (1) This draft only stipulates the minting of silver standard coins and does not involve subsidiary coins. We plan to unify silver standard coins first, and then determine subsidiary coins in the second step in order to avoid confusion. (2) The National Currency Act promulgated in the third year of the Republic originally stipulated that one-yuan silver coins should have a total weight of 7 mace and 2 fen of Kuping, with 9 parts silver and 1 part copper. Later, it was changed to 89 parts silver and 11 parts copper. Various factories successively started minting. In the past ten years, one-yuan silver coins worth about 140,000 yuan have been minted. However, the machines in each factory are of varying quality, and the weight and fineness may not be completely legal. According to the Ministry's chemical examinations, the weight of most coins is 26.8641 grams, and the fineness is 888. Now, if we want to unify with silver standard coins, its weight and fineness must be slightly reduced compared to the most widely circulated coins in the past in order to allow the new coins to circulate smoothly and facilitate the recall and recasting of old coins. Many countries that have reformed their currency systems have done this. There is really no intention to reduce and profit. Therefore, this draft stipulates that the total weight of the silver standard coin is 26.6971 grams, 88 parts silver, and 12 parts copper. (3) Minting coins must be absolutely accurate in weight and fineness in order to gain trust. The Central Mint's machines are the latest and most complete equipment. The coins minted, no matter what yuan, must all meet the tolerances without the slightest error. The old machines and poor methods of the various factories and bureaus cannot be compared with them. Moreover, the right to mint coins should be exclusively reserved for the central government in order to avoid abuses. Therefore, this draft clearly stipulates that the minting of silver standard coins is exclusively reserved for the Central Mint. The concentration of the right to mint coins is enough to show great trust both at home and abroad. The old bureaus and factories should be stopped or converted to other uses. (4) The National Currency Act of the third year of the Republic stipulated that the minting fee for each yuan was 6 li of pure Kuping silver. According to the Ministry's investigation, the actual minting fee for each yuan before the eighth year of the Republic was more than 1 fen and 2 li of Kuping silver. Before the twentieth year of the Republic, it was about 1 fen and 6 li. Recently, the prices of goods and labor have been even higher than before. Without slightly increasing the minting fee, there would be endless losses. Therefore, this draft sets the minting fee at 2.25% of each yuan, which is only enough to cover the cost of materials and labor. There is absolutely no surplus to be said. Although minting coins is a national obligation and labor costs should not be considered, at this time of exhaustion, if we can save one fen of losses, we can indirectly reduce the burden on the people by one fen, which is not contrary to righteousness. (5) Since the old one-yuan silver coins have already been minted in the huge amount of 140 million yuan, if we want to unify with silver standard coins now, we must adopt a gradual replacement method so that there will be no confusion in the market. Therefore, this draft stipulates that old one-yuan silver coins that meet the original weight and fineness can be used in the same way within a certain period. The length of the period should be determined by the Ministry based on the actual circulation of the new coins. All five of these points are the essence of this draft. Whether it is appropriate or not, we should respectfully submit it for public resolution.]</p>

<p>The First District Office regards the Daqiao River north of the North Gate as the throat of the North-South Canal. Since the construction of the embankment and dredging, it has been nearly forty years, and waterway traffic is extremely inconvenient and also affects the bridge foundation, causing danger. Yesterday, four points of pre-emptive errors and post-disaster remedies were specifically proposed, ordering the two town chiefs of Daqiao and Beitang, Chen Zhicheng and Zhao Zixin, to expedite the handling of the matter and not make excuses. The measures are as follows: (1) The river dredging works of the two towns were not reviewed and transferred by the competent authority, and the procedures are extremely erroneous. (2) The project should be presented by the Bureau of Construction to the county for instructions, and responsibility cannot be shirked. (3) The river is of great importance. Not only is there economic loss from the collapse of retaining walls and other things, but also commercial stagnation and cargo blockage. The established facts should be quickly remedied. (4) The town chiefs and others are required to expedite the remedy and report the completion of the project by the deadline.</p>

<p>(Conversion Method) One silver standard coin (yuan) = 23.493448 grams of pure silver. Each Shanghai tael equals 33.599 grams of pure silver. 23.493448 grams / 33.599 = 0.6992305. One silver standard coin (yuan) = 0.6992305 Shanghai taels (pure silver). Plus a minting fee of 2 1/4% = 0.0157327 Shanghai taels (pure silver). Each silver standard coin (yuan) = 0.715 Shanghai taels (pure silver).</p>

<h3 id="e104">Three Banks as Exchange Agents <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed leaders of the silver and banking industries yesterday. According to their discussion, the Ministry of Finance has decided to implement the parallel use of taels and yuan starting March 10th. All transactions in all industries will be converted to the yuan standard, with a fixed conversion rate of 7 mace, 1 candareen, and 5 cash. The Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications will provide unlimited exchange between taels and yuan, or yuan and taels. Once all industries have uniformly adopted the yuan standard, the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan will be completed. Although the Ministry of Finance has tentatively set July 1st as the target date, it is expected that the abolition can be completed in approximately six months. The Central Mint began operations on March 1st, minting new coins, which will be issued by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. In the future, mint bars will be required, for example, each bar worth 1,000 yuan, equivalent to 715 taels of silver, and matched with the correct fineness and weight, to replace the current large tael silver ingots, it was said.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Weng Zhao-yuan's Journey to Rehe to Resist Japan <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Hoping that the National People Will Rise Up and Assist</p>
<p>News reports have been covering the emergency of the war in Rehe in recent days. General Weng Zhao-yuan, formerly of the renowned 19th Route Army which first resisted and then last retreated during the Battle of Shanghai, suddenly led an artillery division to supervise the battle in the Lingyuan area, providing support in the critical situation. Upon hearing this news, people from all walks of life were inexplicably excited and comforted. Yesterday, a reporter from the Kuo Wen News Agency specially interviewed Yin Zhiling to inquire about the beginning and end of General Weng's journey to Rehe to supervise the battle. Yin Zhiling recounted that during the Battle of Shanghai, General Weng stubbornly defended Wusong, which had no defensive equipment, resisting the brutal Japanese army's naval, land, and air forces' siege for more than 30 days without losing an inch of territory. Later, due to a lack of support for the entire army, he was ordered to retreat. General Weng and his army still wanted to defend to the death, but eventually retreated at the earnest request of the people's representatives, but vowed to continue resisting Japan with the spirit of stubbornly defending Wusong, in order to glorify the nation. After the 19th Route Army was transferred to Fujian, several thousand righteous soldiers who had assisted General Weng in resisting Japan in Shanghai and were determined to go to the Northeast to continue resisting Japan went to the Northeast one after another. Because the anti-Japanese war urgently needed airplanes, General Weng went overseas to solicit donations for airplanes to prepare for resisting the enemy. He deeply received the enthusiastic support of overseas Chinese. However, in early January, he was deeply saddened to hear the news of the fall of Shanhaiguan in the Philippines and turned back midway to return to the country to resist the enemy. He went to Fujian and discussed with Generals Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai the spirit of the 19th Route Army's resistance to Japan in order to go north and resist the enemy, which was deeply appreciated. On the memorial day of January 28th, he arrived in Shanghai from Fujian. Upon hearing of the emergency on the Rehe border, he went north that night without being able to meet with people from all walks of life, for which he was very sorry. After arriving in Peiping, he was introduced to Zhang Xueliang by General Zhu Ziqiao, strongly advocating that Rehe must be defended and how to resist the enemy to protect North China and the whole of China, which was deeply appreciated. He then decided to actively prepare to defend Rehe and resist the enemy, according to reports, General Weng and his army were ordered by the military branch to lead an artillery division to the front line in Lingyuan to supervise the battle and provide support. From now on, the Japanese bandits in Rehe will encounter an opponent who will resist, and it will not be easy to be as rampant as before. It is hoped that the national people will rise up to aid Rehe, as a backing for the national hero who is known for resisting Japan, to protect North China and avoid falling into danger, it is fortunate.</p>

<p>Liang Shih-yi, former Minister of Finance of the Beijing government, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong aboard the Dollar Steamship Line's President Coolidge. He landed at the Customs Wharf at 8:30 yesterday morning. According to Liang, who met with a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, he will stay in Shanghai for more than 20 days and then go north to participate in the anti-Japanese work. A second world war may be possible, but it will definitely not be for our country. The people's dependence has become a kind of suicide policy. In the future, the whole country should unite as one and fight to the end in order to win the final victory, and so on.</p>

<p>Every Effort Will Be Made to Resist the Rehe War</p>
<p>Various Rumors are Common Japanese Propaganda Tactics</p>
<p>Remittances of the Boxer Indemnity from Various Countries Will Continue to be Suspended for One Year</p>
<p>Soong Tzu-wen, Acting President of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai by plane the day before yesterday morning from Beijing, accompanied by Secretary Huang Chun-tao and Zhang Xueliang's Western advisor, Donald, to discuss financial issues in North China with the financial community. Yesterday morning at 11 o'clock, Soong met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence on Qizhai Road and delivered an important speech, which is summarized as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e109">Resignation of Three Representatives <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The reporter first asked whether the Reuters dispatch this morning, that Yan Huiqing, Gu Weijun, and Guo Taiqi, the three representatives of our country to the League of Nations, had telegraphed their resignations from Beijing, was true. Soong replied that he had not heard of it himself and would immediately telegraph Foreign Minister Luo Wengan to inquire about the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Uncertain Whether to Go North <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>When asked when he would go north, he said that it was not yet certain whether he would go north, and that it would depend on the needs of the situation in the future. As for his visit to Shanghai this time, (1) it was to inspect the mint's minting of new coins, and (2) it was to discuss financial matters.</p>
<h3 id="e111">War in Rehe <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the war in Rehe, news reports have been frequent in recent days, and our army has suffered many defeats. Yesterday morning, the reporter asked Soong about the truth of the war in Rehe. Soong said that the war in Rehe initially took place in the railway area. The Japanese side had various transportation conveniences. Our army had to change its lines due to strategic considerations. Now our army is defending firmly with danger, and we will make every effort to resist desperately. Success or failure is not to be considered. As for the rumors that Sun Dianying surrendered and that the volunteer army defected, these are common Japanese propaganda tactics and are not worth refuting, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Abolishing Taels and Adopting Yuan <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Soong also said that the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan were originally scheduled to be implemented on March 1st, but because he had been away from Beijing for many days and everything had not been arranged, it had to be postponed. As for the Currency Ordinance, it was submitted to the Central Political Council for discussion and approval yesterday, and it can be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review today. There should be no problems.</p>

<p>Soong also said that regarding the 20 million national salvation bonds, it was originally decided by the Peiping Political Affairs Committee and approved by the Central Political Council for the record, and issued in Peiping and Tianjin. The Central Government will allocate 500,000 yuan per month from the cigarette tax to the committee as a fund for issuance. There has been much speculation outside, but none of it is true.</p>

Although the remittance of the Boxer Indemnity has been suspended, it will still be continued. Japanese merchants at Shanhaiguan refused to pay Chinese customs duties, and we have lodged a serious protest and are negotiating with them.</p>

<p>Replenishing Military Resources and Advancing Towards Jinxi</p>
<p>Continuing Efforts to Seek Final Victory</p>
<p>General Geng Jizhou, Commander of the 4th Route Army of the Liaoning Volunteer Army, retreated to Rehe after running out of ammunition and being cut off from reinforcements. He gathered reinforcements in Lingnan and advanced towards Jinxi to continue resisting the enemy. General Geng sent a special telegram to Shanghai expressing his determination to fight to the death. The original telegram is excerpted below: (Omitted above) are all aware that since the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, the Japanese warlords have been arrogant and tyrannical, destroying the Nine-Power Treaty, forcibly occupying the three northeastern provinces, and then disturbing Shanghai. Recently, they have increased their troops in Yuyu, becoming ferocious, and are trying to encompass North China to complete their ambition of a continental policy. They are willing to be the leaders of the Rong and Di tribes, and have no regard for justice. Wherever their troops go, they rape, plunder, and kill, using inhuman means against our people. Looking at our 400 million Yan and Huang descendants, they will all be the fish and meat of the Japanese slaves. All those who are citizens cannot but be heartbroken by this. Jizhou is registered in the army, cherishes his homeland, and deeply laments its loss. Therefore, he raised the banner of righteousness and vowed to destroy the ugly prisoners. Fortunately, the strong men of Liaodong have a deep understanding of righteousness. Wherever the army goes, the scenery is followed. In total, he has fought with the enemy in more than 40 battles, large and small. He has always been able to fight with the same hatred and chase after the fleeing enemy. Although he has not been able to directly attack Huanglong and restore our rivers and mountains, he has made surprise attacks and won by surprise. In the end, he has made the enemy tired of running around and knows that the heart of our nation is not dead and cannot be easily humiliated. He had previously temporarily retreated to defend the line due to running out of ammunition and being cut off from reinforcements. Now he has gathered his old troops, set up a headquarters in Lingnan, replenished his military resources, and is advancing again towards Jinxi. He will continue to work hard to achieve the final victory. I hereby solemnly declare and announce to the people of the country that, at this time, the national crisis is urgent, and the foreign enemy is deep. The loss of the three eastern provinces is not the misfortune of the 30 million people of the three eastern provinces, but the juncture of life and death for our Chinese nation. If we do not fight, we will die. If we fight, we may not die. Rather than sitting and waiting for death, why not raise the banner of national revolutionary war and work together to fight a death battle with Japanese imperialism to achieve freedom and independence? Time is pressing, and there is no room for hesitation. Revolutionary people, why not come? Jizhou is a mere warrior, dull in nature, only knowing how to fight for the survival of the people, and not knowing how to be a slave of foreigners. As long as there is breath left, I will vow to resist Japan. People of insight at home and abroad, come and teach me. It is fortunate, it is fortunate. Liaoning Volunteer Army 4th Route Commander Geng Jizhou leads all soldiers and officers to salute the east.</p>

<p>Russian Envoy Expected Soon</p>
<p>To Serve as Temporary Embassy</p>
<p>The *Ta Mei Wan Pao* reports, according to reliable sources, that the Soviet Russian Consulate in Shanghai is expected to reopen around the 15th of this month, or even a few days earlier. The newly appointed Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, departed from Moscow on February 15th by Siberian train and is expected to arrive in Shanghai between March 10th and 15th, unless his plans change unexpectedly. Upon arrival, he will reside in the consulate for one or two weeks before proceeding to Nanjing to present his credentials. After the audience, he will return to Shanghai, using the consulate as a temporary embassy until a new location is found in Nanjing, after which he will move. Today, a reporter observed from the Astor House Hotel that the windows of the consulate were fully open and had been thoroughly cleaned. In a room on the second floor, facing the Astor House Hotel, a large portrait of Lenin was seen hanging on the wall, but no other furnishings were visible.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Overseas Chinese Returning Home Hold a Temporary National Salvation Conference on the "Garland" Ship <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Enthusiastic Public Sentiment</p>
<p>Eager Donations</p>
<p>Since the "Garland" President ship set sail from the United States, overseas Chinese returning home have been extremely concerned about national affairs, eagerly reading wireless news received during the day. On March 1st, when the ship departed from Kobe, Japan, Mr. Cao Bolan, a passenger, gave a speech in the ship's cabin about the situation of resistance against Japan, urging overseas Chinese returning home to donate funds for the Northeast Volunteer Army, so that the military expenses of the anti-Japanese national salvation army could be continuously supplied. This was deeply appreciated by the fellow countrymen and women on board. The next day (2nd), the overseas Chinese organized the [Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association] on the ship, decorating the cabin as a meeting place, hanging national and party flags, and a portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the center. They elected Mr. Cao Bolan as the temporary chairman, Mr. Wu Xingzhong as the secretary, and Fang Wenjin, Lin Fu, Cao Bolan, Wu Xingzhong, Ye Zhi, etc. as donation commissioners, and Chen Sancai and Zheng Ronghua as treasurers. Mr. Cao Bolan also served as the donation officer. The order of the meeting was as follows: (1) All overseas Chinese bowed three times to the national and party flags; (2) Bowed three times to the portrait of the Prime Minister; (3) The chairman bowed once to all overseas Chinese. After the ceremony, the chairman announced the reason for the meeting, and then gave a speech about the tragic situation of the Japanese army's massacre of civilians in Fushun, Northeast China. All the overseas Chinese were moved by what they heard, their hair standing on end and eyes wide with anger. Following this, speakers included Mr. Fang Wenjin, a representative of the sailors, Mr. Lin Fu, an overseas Chinese returning from Cuba, and Mr. Lu Wentao and Mr. Wu Xingzhong, overseas Chinese from Honolulu, and others. After the speeches, the donation commissioners solicited donations from fellow countrymen and women, collecting over eighty US dollars on the spot, which was all handed over to the treasurers for safekeeping. On the 3rd, when the ship arrived in Shanghai, representatives from the overseas Chinese handed the money to General Zhu Qinglan of the Shanghai National Salvation Association to be transferred to the Northeast Volunteer Army to provide them with funds. At that time, a receipt was obtained and posted in the ship's cabin to show good faith.</p>

<p>Expulsion of Member Hu Shih</p>
<p>China League for Civil Rights</p>
<p>The Provisional Central Executive Committee held a meeting yesterday and resolved to expel Mr. Hu Shih from the League. The reason for the expulsion, it is reported, is that Mr. Hu's views on fundamental principles of civil rights protection, as expressed in various Chinese and foreign newspapers, are inconsistent with the League's constitution. Furthermore, Mr. Hu has made baseless attacks on the League. The League sent two telegrams requesting Mr. Hu to publicly correct his statements. As of the meeting, a satisfactory response had not been received. At the same time, the China League for Civil Rights reiterated the League's principles, paying particular attention to the release of political prisoners, which Mr. Hu opposed. The League believes that the release of political prisoners and the movement for human rights are inseparable in principle.</p>
<p>Telegram Requesting the Release of Tao Guoxian</p>
<p>To the esteemed Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government: Tao Guoxian, a graduate of Tsinghua University, was imprisoned three years ago for his membership in the National Socialist Youth Party and has not yet been released. With the national crisis pressing, youth are needed. We hope you will release him to uphold civil rights. Song Qingling and Cai Yuanpei, President and Vice President of the China League for Civil Rights.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Ren Chuanzhi Sends Letter to Chiang Kaishek Requesting to Serve <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Former Commander of the Anti-Rebellion Army, Ren Chuanzhi, whose troops were strong and had achieved notable military success, recently returned to Shanghai from Nanjing to seek medical treatment due to illness. He learned that his former subordinates were secretly transporting horses and multiple mortars, volunteering to resist Japan. He sent a letter to Chairman Chiang Kaishek, stating: "The situation in Rehe is tense, and the righteous army is fighting bravely. If the powerful enemy is not contained, they may disturb the north and invade the south. All of us in the country should prepare to deal with the enemy. As I have led troops in the past, I have an unshirkable responsibility. Lying ill in my Shanghai residence, I am burning with worry and indignation. Previously, I waited for assignment in Nanjing and requested the reorganization of my former troops, concentrating them in the Soviet-controlled border area of Xuzhou to strengthen training for defensive purposes. I received a letter of encouragement, stating that concentration was not necessary and that arrangements would be made when the opportunity arose. However, I hear that a portion of my artillery regiment is urgently seeking a way out, volunteering to resist Japan. Recalling the military and political period, I spared no effort to promote unification, even to the point of destroying my own family, maintaining my strength without daring to show my hand, to avoid being criticized for being angered by criticism or delighted by praise, which led to insufficient attention from the central government. Now is the time. I dare to ask you, remembering my sincerity, to approve the arrangements previously indicated and to grant me a task, whether in the rear or on the front lines, or to allow my old and new troops to concentrate their forces and jointly face the national crisis. I am making these urgent requests and respectfully await your orders."</p>
<h3 id="e140">Party and Government Organs Inspect Rice Measuring Devices Yesterday <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>

<p>Rice Merchants Petition to Stop the Use of Heavy Measures</p>
<p>After rice merchants protested against the use of heavy measures and went on strike, party and government organs, together with rice industry groups, inspected the light and heavy measures, funnels, scales, and level measures yesterday. Rice merchants from various guilds submitted a petition to the central government requesting to stop the use of heavy measures. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e141">Inspection Process <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>

The inspection procedures were as follows: (1) Use the inspected funnel, measuring only its weight, averaging ten measures; (2) Use the rice merchants' funnel measure; (3) Use the heavy measure; (4) Use the light measure; (5) Use the hand measure; (6) Use a mouth to limit the height; (7) Do not use a mouth or fence, filling it twice, divided into A, light before heavy; B, heavy before light; C, average.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Results Obtained <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The results of the public inspection were as follows: The Bureau of Weights and Measures funnel measured 5 dou, 81 jin, and 14 liang per measure. The rice merchants' funnel measured 82 jin and 8 liang per measure. The measure makers' fence measure measured 82 jin and 4 liang per measure. The fence heavy measure measured 83 jin and 12 liang, 83 jin and 13 liang, and 84 jin and 14 liang per measure (rice merchants' measure). The fence level measure measured 83 jin and 4 liang per measure (rice merchants' measure). The inland measure measured 81 jin and 13 liang per measure (rice merchants' measure). The fence level measure measured 82 jin and 2 liang per measure (measure makers' measure). The fence level measure measured 81 jin and 10 liang, 81 jin and 10 liang, and 81 jin and 8 liang per measure (rice merchants' measure). The fence heavy measure measured 82 jin and 12 liang and 82 jin and 10 liang per measure (rice merchants' measure). The heaviest was 84 jin and 2 liang, and the lightest was 81 jin and 8 liang. The tare weight was 2 jin and 2 liang. However, these results must be discussed by party and government organs before a decision is made on the measures to be taken.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Consultative Measures <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>At 1:30 PM, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a consultative meeting to discuss measures. He Yuanming of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhang Binghui and Zhou Minggang of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhu Zixiang and Yan Xiaoquan of the Rice Industry Association, Chen Zhiqiang of the Shanghai South Rice Merchants Association, and Lu Quanlin of the Measure Makers' Union attended. Zhang Binghui of the Social Affairs Bureau chaired the meeting. Due to the absence of representatives from the Rice Merchants Association, it was impossible to proceed. It was decided to reschedule the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Petition from Rice Merchants <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The rice merchants from various guilds in Shanghai South submitted a document to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Party Headquarters, stating: "For the sake of eliminating long-standing abuses, relieving the plight of merchants, and maintaining the people's food supply, the entire body of rice merchants in Shanghai has been subjected to the abuses of line numbers and measure makers' use of fences and heavy measures, oppression and exploitation, for many years, with no recourse. Now that the National Government has promulgated new weights and measures, the merchants are celebrating with joy. However, the line numbers in Shanghai are using six-dou measures, disregarding the national decrees. The merchants have telegraphed the Ministry of Industry, and approval has been granted to prohibit their use. The merchants, being ignorant, have repeatedly petitioned party and government organs in order to alleviate their own suffering, resulting in an unintended strike, which was a last resort. The intention is to hope that party and government organs will pay special attention and find a fair solution as soon as possible. However, it has been delayed for more than two weeks. On March 1st, party and government organs convened a mediation meeting with the merchants at the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau. The merchants advocated the use of level funnels, which are fair and impartial. Even a five-foot child can use the new measuring devices for loading and unloading without loss. However, the representatives of the rice numbers, deeply entrenched in their abuses, strongly opposed this and advocated the use of scales. It is known that the abuses of scales are even greater. The merchants stated that they could be tested on the spot, and the abuses would be immediately apparent. Most of the merchants come from the countryside and do not recognize the scale numbers, making them easily deceived. Moreover, the inland uses measures, while Shanghai uses scales. It is clear that there will be losses from using measures for entry and scales for exit. Furthermore, rice is dry or wet, and transportation takes time. If scales are used, the losses are difficult to calculate. Regarding all these arguments, the rice numbers insisted on using scales, and the party representatives proposed testing both scales and funnels first to see which has no abuses and then using that. As a result, no conclusion was reached, and the meeting adjourned. The next day, a field test was conducted without inviting the merchants to participate. Today (March 3rd), another test was conducted without notifying the merchants. Therefore, the merchants wanted to point out the advantages and disadvantages of scales on the spot and explain the fairness of funnels, which could be tested face-to-face. Because of all these reasons, for the sake of the future of the people's food supply and to alleviate the suffering of all the merchants, we cannot but sincerely petition, hoping that you will investigate and instruct the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to resolve this issue fairly as soon as possible, so that the level funnel requested by the merchants can be achieved, which will demonstrate fairness and relieve the plight of the merchants. Please examine this carefully. Respectfully submitted."</p>

<h3 id="e146">Questions from the Lawyers' Association Regarding the Revocation of Lawyers' Certificates <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association telegraphed a document to the Judicial Administration Department yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Judicial Administration Department, we have received a report from our member Li Shirui stating that he has been expelled from the Party by the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and that the Party Headquarters has submitted a request to the higher Party Headquarters to forward it to your department to revoke his lawyer's certificate. According to the regulations on matters for which a lawyer should be disciplined, the current lawyer's regulations should be used as the standard until the Lawyer Law is formulated and promulgated. These regulations stipulate that, except for Article 4, which prohibits those who have been sentenced to detention or fixed-term imprisonment of the fifth grade or higher, or who have been declared bankrupt and have not been reinstated, from serving as lawyers at all, there are no other restrictions. Those who have already served as lawyers, according to Article 35, must have violated these regulations or the Lawyers' Association's rules before being subject to disciplinary action, and the application and submission must be carried out through specific agencies and procedures, as detailed in various articles in Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4. Article 36 also contains provisions for requesting a review, which is because lawyers may be wrongly convicted in the course of performing their duties, and the establishment of strict guarantees has a profound legislative meaning. The more serious disciplinary actions are suspension or expulsion, but there is no provision for revoking certificates. Furthermore, even if a lawyer is convicted and receives a criminal penalty, he must still be subjected to disciplinary action according to the law. The Party Headquarters' punishment of our member Li Shirui has not yet been approved by the higher Party Headquarters, and whether the reason for his punishment is correct is not something that our association should address. However, since lawyer discipline is governed by various articles of the lawyer's regulations that can be followed, how to handle the revocation of the lawyer's certificate is something we await instructions on. Shanghai Lawyers' Association, Shen Junru and Lu Dingkui."</p>
<h3 id="e147">Shanghai Shipping Merchants Oppose the Increase in Pilotage Fees for the Song-Han Route <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Pilotage on the Yangtze River has always been disorganized and inconsistent. There are also several Jiang River Pilot Associations, and each shipping company also has its own contracted pilots. Recently, after Yang Honglin and others organized the Song-Han Pilot Association, they established an office on Sijing Road and drafted articles of association, notifying the shipping companies and increasing the pilotage fees, claiming that it had been approved by the Ministry of the Navy. They also restricted shipping merchants from having captains serve as pilots and charged extra fees, leading to opposition from the shipping merchants. The details of this matter are reported below:</p>
<h3 id="e148">Original Price List <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Pilotage on the Yangtze River has always been divided into Ningbo Guild, Hubei Guild, etc., and the route from Wusong to Hankou is divided into seven sections. When Jiang River ships exit upstream, the pilots who guide them charge pilotage fees, which are listed for each section. From Wusong to Tongzhou is 70 dollars, to Zhenjiang is 90 dollars, to Shi'erxu is 100 dollars, to Nanjing or Pukou is 130 dollars, to Wuhu is 150 dollars, to Jiujiang is 250 dollars, and to Hankou is 340 dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e149">New Increased Rates <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Song-Han Pilot Association, they re-established the price list, still dividing it into seven sections, but increasing the original fees by about 35 to 40 percent. According to the new fee schedule notified to the shipping companies by the association, from Wusong to Tongzhou, an additional 30 dollars is added, making it 100 dollars; to Zhenjiang or Shi'erxu, an additional 50 dollars is added, making it 140 dollars; to Jiangyin, it is increased to 120 dollars; to Nanjing or Pukou, an additional 70 dollars is added, making it 200 dollars; to Wuhu, an additional 90 dollars is added, making it 240 dollars; to Anqing, an additional 100 dollars is added, making it 300 dollars; to Jiujiang, an additional 110 dollars is added, making it 350 dollars; and to Hankou, an additional 110 dollars is added, making it 450 dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Special Fees <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The above price list is only for ships on the Yangtze River under 3,000 tons. For ships over 3,000 tons, the new price must be increased accordingly, and there are also additional special fees. If the ship is delayed en route for more days, the shipping company must pay the pilot extra allowances. It is stipulated that if the ship stays in a port below Wuhu for more than one day, an additional 5 dollars must be paid; if it stays above Wuhu for more than one day, an additional 10 dollars must be paid. It is also restricted that shipowners and chief officers of Yangtze River ships are not allowed to serve as pilots.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Opposition from Shipping Merchants <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>After the association notified the shipping companies, the Chinese shipping companies in Shanghai unanimously opposed the increase in pilotage fees, the additional charges for ships over 3,000 tons, the collection of special fees, and the restriction on shipowners serving as pilots. The Shanghai Shipping Guild then submitted a petition to the Ministry of Communications, which was forwarded to the Ministry of the Navy to inquire whether the Song-Han Pilot Association's fee increase had been approved by the Navy, as claimed in the association's letter. The Ministry of Communications replied, stating that the Navy had not approved or filed the Song-Han Pilot Association's fee increase. Therefore, the shipping companies in Shanghai have firmly rejected the above-mentioned additional fees, special fees, and the prohibition of shipowners serving as pilots, and have continued to report to the Ministry of Communications for instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Telephone Issues Outside the Concessions <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>At the Municipal Council meeting this Wednesday (the 3rd), the Secretary General reported that the French Concession authorities had considered the draft provisional contract for telephones on roads outside the Concession and agreed that the telephone rental fees (i.e., those paid to the Chinese Telephone Bureau) that users outside the Concession should pay for municipal donations should be included in the company's "tariff reform account" and borne by all users. As this rental fee is temporary in nature and limited to a number of users, and only for a year, the French Concession authorities do not agree to have French Concession users share in the cost. After discussion, the Municipal Council stated that users outside the Concession are granted convenience by the special permission of the Chinese authorities, and it cannot be said to be unfair if they share in this cost.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Xu Yongliang, a Notorious Bandit Leader from Rugao, Captured in Shanghai <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Xu Yongliang, a notorious bandit leader from Rugao County, along with Zong Siditoujiang, Wang Shiyuan, Lao Lu (also known as Lu Xiazi), and others, repeatedly ganged up to rape, plunder, murder, and commit arson in the southwest districts of the county, doing everything wrong. Qian Zuoyi, the Rugao County Magistrate, repeatedly ordered the county Public Security Bureau's detective team to arrest them, but the cases had not been solved. Recently, the county received a tip that the fugitive bandit leader Xu Yongliang and others were hiding in a certain location in Shanghai. The county immediately sent the detective team leader and detective Liu Yongkui to Shanghai with a warrant, requesting the assistance of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen. Wen Hongen then ordered Captain Lu to send detective Wu Kezhong, along with the county detective, to cooperate with the police officers from the 6th District. At 7:00 PM the night before last, they were captured near the entrance of Xinkang Lane on Jessfield Road in western Shanghai. The bandit leader Xu Yongliang is 24 years old. Furthermore, Zhou Heshang, a member of the gang, was arrested in a flat at No. 99 Gaojiazhai. He is 29 years old, both from Rugao. Both were taken into custody and escorted to the Headquarters yesterday morning for investigation. It is reported that the Bureau has handed over the two criminals, Xu and Zhou, to the personnel who came to take them back for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Public Works Bureau Discusses Traffic Issues <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Vehicles East of Tongfu Road Still Not Allowed to Overtake</p>
<p>Tram Stop at Xiejiao General Chamber of Commerce Moved to Qinghai Road Intersection</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's board of directors, during its March 1st meeting, discussed the Traffic Committee's proposals. Among them was a proposal from last year to change the rule stating that vehicles east of Tongfu Road on Jing'an Temple Road were not allowed to overtake, to east of Mahok Road, due to the widening of the area around the Summer Peacock Theatre. This case was reviewed by the traffic division of the police department, which believed that it was not appropriate for cars to race between Tongfu Road and Mahok Road, and advocated maintaining the original rule. The committee reconsidered and decided that no changes were necessary. Furthermore, it was previously suggested that the tram stop in front of the Xiejiao General Chamber of Commerce was dangerous for passengers getting on and off and also obstructed traffic. It was proposed to move it slightly east or west. The traffic division investigated and found no suitable locations in either direction. The tram company also opposed the cancellation of this stop. It was suggested to move it to the intersection of Qinghai Road and Xiejiao Road. After review, the committee decided to build a wooden platform at this intersection to facilitate passengers getting on and off the tram, as a trial measure. Both of the above proposals were approved by the board of directors. In addition, a letter from Changxing Shipping Company stated that the Public Works Bureau's pier at the customs ferry terminal on the riverside was extremely crowded, hindering passengers getting on and off. This matter has been referred to the Traffic Committee for consideration, and relevant departments will submit their opinions, which will be discussed at the next meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Public Works Bureau Studies Methods to Prevent Tax Evasion <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Proposes Closing Off a Portion of Roads</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's board of directors, during its meeting on the 1st of this month, discussed the Public Works Committee's proposed methods to prevent the smuggling of undeclared goods at the docks. This matter was brought to the attention of the Public Works Bureau by the Customs Superintendent, who stated that for the sake of protecting tax revenue, goods that have not been taxed should not be allowed to cross the road from the docks into warehouses. This would require the closing off of several roads, and the relevant shipping companies have requested the Public Works Bureau to sell or lease the closed-off sections to them for their use. According to the Public Works Director's report, the roads involved are Yuanfang Road, Taiping Road, and North Yangzi Road, and the docks involved belong to Nippon Yusen Kaisha, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Gibb, Livingston &amp; Co. The investigation found that, apart from a few sampan boatmen, the public rarely used these sections of the road. They were mainly used for traffic to and from the docks. If closed off, it would not cause any inconvenience to the public. After the closure, the land could be leased to nearby landowners at a reasonable price, with the condition that it be re-negotiated after three years (or other number of years). The repair and maintenance after the lease would be the responsibility of the lessee, and it should be stipulated that if the land is to be reclaimed in the future, the cost of restoring it to its original condition should also be borne by the lessee. According to the investigation by the members of the Public Works Committee, the request from the customs authorities was considered reasonable. However, when leasing the roads, it should be clearly stipulated that the Public Works Bureau has the right to reclaim the land at any time with a notice period of several months. After discussion, the committee decided that closing off these roads would benefit the public interest. However, the matter still requires further investigation and reporting before a final decision can be made.</p>

<p>The Foreign Consultant is the Son of the Premier's Old Friend</p>
<p>His Servant Steals Valuable Jewelry</p>
<p>Gives a Diamond Ring to a Sincere Department Store Tea Girl</p>
<p>The Tea Girl is a Key Figure in the Yue Patrol Shooting Incident</p>
<p>Zhang Shengbao, a Ningbo native, 22 years old, and his uncle, Zhang A'yu, were both employed at the home of Kantrick, a British consultant on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway (whose father, Kantierli, was a friend of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and rescued the late Premier when he was in distress in London in his early years; the current President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Ke, is also a close friend of Kantrick, and when he was Minister of Railways, he gave him the position of railway consultant), at 1276 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Shengbao was a servant, and A'yu was the head steward. During his leisure time, Shengbao often went to the Sincere Amusement Park, where he met Zhang Fengying, a young woman from Wuxi who worked as a tea girl (who is also a key figure in the tragic incident that occurred the other day on New Bridge Street when she and her colleague Xu Lianzhen were in a rickshaw and were stopped by Yue patrol officer number 427; her husband, Zhang Hongshou, works at Butterfield &amp; Swire). Recently, due to financial difficulties, he had a malicious thought and, while the master was out, sneaked into the room and stole a gold bracelet, a set of diamond tuxedo buttons, four gold buttons, a women's diamond ring, a fountain pen, and other items worth more than a thousand yuan. He absconded with the loot, sold it, and used the money. He gave the diamond ring to Zhang Fengying. After the incident, the victim reported to the police station to request an arrest. Detective Gu Wuzhou discovered that Zhang and others were meeting in a room at the Great Shanghai Hotel. He went with Chinese and foreign detectives from the Zhabei Police Station to arrest Zhang and others. The diamond ring was found on Zhang's hand, and the original stolen goods were also retrieved. They were taken back to the police station and sent to the Second Special District Court yesterday, where Magistrate Zhang Chaozuo conducted the preliminary hearing. First, police lawyer Yuan Jiahong stated the facts of the case and presented the stolen goods. Zhang Shengbao confessed to the theft. Zhang Fengying claimed that the ring was being kept at her place and was not given to her. She was arrested yesterday while returning it. The court verified the confession and adjourned the hearing to a later date. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Travel Agency Sends Letters to Contributors Seeking Consent</p>
<p>China Travel Service sent a letter to all photography contributors yesterday, which stated, "Dear Sir/Madam, Our company was entrusted by the Chicago Exposition Preparatory Committee to collect photography submissions. We are deeply grateful for your support in sending your works. We have collected over a thousand pieces and selected over four hundred of the best works, which have been sent to the Exposition for public exhibition. We originally planned to ship them to the United States on a set date, but unexpectedly, the committee recently received an order from the ministry to close down, and all submissions have been suspended from being shipped to the United States. After careful consideration and with the consent of the committee, we plan to sell all of these submissions and donate the proceeds to the Northeast Volunteer Army. We believe that your patriotic spirit will certainly approve of this. The proposed methods are as follows: (1) Our company will hold a public exhibition of all selected works at the Shanghai Bank Library for two weeks starting from March 8th. (2) The committee will estimate the price of each item, and anyone can purchase them. (3) The proceeds from the sale will be handed over to General Zhu Qinglan to be forwarded to the Northeast Volunteer Army. If you are unable to express your consent or if you have any suggestions regarding the price at which your work should be sold, please notify our company before the 15th of this month. If no response is received by the deadline, it will be considered as consent. We hope that you will consider the above points. Our company has proposed these methods due to unforeseen circumstances, and we are doing so with great reluctance. However, we believe that using works that showcase national glory to support the resistance against the Japanese is a worthwhile endeavor. We trust that you, with your wisdom, will find this feasible. We have expressed our thoughts briefly and hope for your understanding. Best regards, China Travel Service."</p>

<p>Last December, the Italian government launched the International Film Competition. The association noted that China's film industry was making rapid progress, and the government sent a document to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country, welcoming our country to participate. The National Government instructed the two ministries of Internal Affairs and Education and the Central Film Censorship Board to handle the matter carefully. The Central Film Censorship Board held a meeting to discuss and decided to select the best productions from all film production companies in the country using a multiple-choice method to attend the event. In the preliminary selection results on January 6, fourteen films were selected. Films produced by the Lianhua Film Company accounted for eleven, films produced by the Mingxing Film Company accounted for two, and the Tianyi Film Company accounted for one. After the re-election on the 20th, five films were finally selected and sent to the conference. The Lianhua Film Company accounted for four, and the Mingxing Film Company accounted for one. The five films sent to Italy are "City Nights" (Lianhua), "Three Modern Women" (Lianhua), "Wild Rose" (Lianhua), "Metropolitan Morning" (Lianhua), and "Freedom Flower" (Mingxing). The Lianhua Film Company has risen rapidly, and its productions have always been at the forefront of the ideological trends of the times, so it has won the sympathy of the people. It is appropriate that it was selected the most times. It is hoped that it will not be complacent and will continue to work hard to bring glory to the country.</p>

<p>Discussing the Yue Patrol Shooting Case</p>
<p>Publicly Elected Du Yuesheng to Negotiate</p>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association convened a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees at the Shandong Guild Hall at around 3:30 PM yesterday. The committee members present were Qu Zhenhua, Dong Kechang, Zhu Shengmao, Bei Zairong, Cheng Zhusun, Zhang Xiaolin, Shang Mujiang, Li Weiliang, Pan Zhaobang, Tong Lizhang, Xu Xiuting, Du Yuesheng, Xi Jingyan, Jin Liren, and fourteen others. Du Yuesheng presided over the meeting, and Tong Lizhang recorded the minutes. Matters reported: (1) A report on the letter from the French Public Works Bureau regarding the collection of sanitation fees from the plank industry, it was decided to translate the letter and forward it to the industry. (2) Reports on letters from the Ningbo Fellow Association, the Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, the Shanghai General Labor Union, the Postal Workers Union, the Chaozhou Fellow Association, and the Second Special District Citizens' Federation, all regarding the Yue Patrol shooting of Chinese. (3) Chairman Du reported that he had already contacted the French Consul General Fabre regarding the case. According to his expression, he had a sincere desire to resolve the issue, so the matter could be resolved peacefully to avoid escalation. Matters discussed: (1) Regarding the Yue Patrol killing of two Chinese, Zhu Gutin and Liu Fugao, and injuring Xu Linsheng and Zhao Changxiao, since the incident occurred, all parties have been outraged. As a group of citizens in the French Concession, this association should express its stance to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents and seek peace and tranquility for the citizens. However, according to Chairman Du's report, the French authorities are sincerely resolving the case and have agreed to severely punish the murderer according to the law, provide generous compensation to the families of the deceased, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again. It was resolved to publicly elect Chairman Du to further discuss the aftermath with the French authorities. (2) Regarding the letters from all parties, all expressed their sincere feelings regarding the case. This association will respond to all groups based on Chairman Du's report and express its cooperation. (3) Guan Zhenhua, Xi Jingyan, Shang Mujiang, and others proposed that since sitting two people in a rickshaw is not prohibited in the Chinese and British concessions, why is it uniquely prohibited in the French Concession, leading to this incident? In the future, the French authorities should be requested to lift the prohibition to avoid the recurrence of similar incidents. It was resolved to send a letter to the Chinese directors to raise this issue with the French Public Works Bureau. (4) All committee members proposed that since the French authorities have recently added Yue Patrol to the police force, and Yue Patrol often do not understand the language, it is easy to cause trouble. In the future, the French authorities should be requested to use more Chinese police and fewer Yue Patrol. It was resolved to also request Chairman Du to contact the French authorities. (5) Chairman Du reported that the current French Consul General was transferred from Tianjin and is quite familiar with the situation of the Chinese people. In short, the standard is to resolve this matter peacefully first. If a satisfactory solution cannot be obtained, it will be discussed again. It was unanimously decided to support the handling of the negotiations. (6) Shang Mujiang proposed the problem of the Association's location. A Western-style house at No. 12 Saposai Road has been found, and the estimated monthly expenditure is approximately 300 yuan. It was resolved that each Chinese director and committee member will be responsible for the shortfall, which will be undertaken by Chairman Du. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>Rural medicine in our country has long suffered from famine. Hygienic knowledge has not been instilled in the minds of farmers, and the sick fill the roads, and deaths pile up in the fields. This is truly the greatest disaster that damages the vitality of the nation. In addition, in recent years, the rural economy has rapidly collapsed. The majority of farmers cannot even support themselves. When they are sick, they either beg for mercy under the clay sculptures and wooden carvings, or they let the disease take its natural course. As a result, countless people die prematurely. The population is in a state of decline, which is truly the most serious national problem in front of us. Now, there are</p>
<p>Rural medical and political experts Zhu Dian, Yang Zexu, Huang Yiding, Chen Shifu, Jin Shule, Zhang Henian, Shen Yusheng, Shen Fengxiang, etc., who are aware of this situation, rely on organizing the Rural Medicine Improvement Association (address: No. 13 Jinghu Railway Station Road, Shanghai). With the aim of saving the sick and promoting hygiene, the association is actively preparing to build rural hospitals throughout the country. The initial plan is to successively establish model rural hospitals in various provinces and counties to meet urgent needs. The association has now applied to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department for a permit and officially announced its establishment. Anyone in the medical and pharmaceutical fields who wants to read the association's articles of association can attach a one-cent postage stamp, and they will be sent to you.</p>
<h3 id="e163">After Discovery of Female Corpse in a Sack, Wang Jinke Suddenly Accuses of Wife's Disappearance <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Court Believes Wang Himself is Suspicious</p>
<p>Yesterday's report mentioned that a fisherman caught a female corpse in a sack in the Wangjiazhai pool on Huangxing Road in the Hudong District. It is now known that after the corpse was caught, Wang Jinke, who lived there, went to the Fourth Section of the Fifth District to accuse his wife, Wang Wang (originally a concubine), of having disappeared last year and being murdered by neighbors Guo Zhaoru and Ji Xingcheng. It was then recognized that the corpse was the said female corpse. The station arrested Guo and Ji, but they both denied the allegations. They were sent to the District Court yesterday, where Prosecutor Wu conducted a preliminary hearing. Because Wang Jinke's wife had been dead for a year, he should have reported it earlier, but only after the corpse was discovered did he accuse others. Then, since he lost track of his wife a year ago, why did he not express anything at all? It is feared that the death of the woman may be related to Wang Jinke. Therefore, in order to clarify the matter, Wang Jinke, Guo Zhaoru, and Ji Xingcheng were all detained to await investigation and further handling.</p>

<p>Clearly Shows Signs of Fraud</p>
<p>Zhang Muzhai Accused by Shareholders</p>
<p>Gong Daxiang Grocery Store, located at No. 7, Bulinli, Fadama Road, was established by Zhang Yunqing, Wei Lishan, and others from Taizhou as a joint venture, and Zhang Muzhai from the same hometown was hired as the manager. Recently, due to the impact of the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the business ran aground. The board of directors decided to liquidate. Now, shareholder Wei Lishan has discovered that manager Zhang Muzhai has fraudulent accounts and has misappropriated customer funds. He reported this to the French police, and Detective Wang Rusong arrested Zhang Muzhai at the Xin Daxing Hotel in Caishi Street. He was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second District yesterday, where police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the facts of the case. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that Zhang had received payments from several customers, including Zheng Yongli and Chen Weimin, but did not enter them into the account books. He also falsely listed customers, paid interest, and embezzled funds. It is currently found that the amount is about 3,000 yuan. Uninvestigated cases have been sent letters for inquiry. He further claimed that the defendant had left seven blank spaces in the account books, clearly showing signs of fraud. When questioned, Zhang Muzhai denied embezzlement. He said that the embezzled funds were added to his name by his partners, about 800 or 900 yuan. After the presiding judge Wang Gangxu verified the confession, because the evidence was not complete, he ordered the case to be adjourned to a later date. The defendant was ordered to provide a deposit of 5,000 yuan. Without bail, he was taken into custody.</p>

<p>Song Xining, a 22-year-old woman from this town residing at No. 8 Yanhai Road in the city, married Fang Qiaonong (also known as Fang Zemin), who used to work at the Wenling Tobacco and Alcohol Collection Office, in September 1929. Their relationship was initially harmonious, but later Fang developed a fondness for the new and abandoned the old. He had an affair with a woman named Ye Yanqiu. On New Year's Day 1931, they held a wedding ceremony, unknown to Song. After the January 28th Incident last year, Fang used the excuse of seeking refuge and asked Song to return to her mother's home temporarily. He then secretly lived with Ye elsewhere. After the war ended, Song could not find Fang. At first, she thought he was living elsewhere and that they would reunite someday. However, she waited in vain. Last winter, Song examined her luggage and discovered evidence of Fang and Ye's marriage certificate and life-and-death agreement, and various other evidence of bigamy. She then realized that Fang had married another woman. In grief and anger, she hired lawyer Zhu Chengxun and filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court, requesting a public announcement and a judgment of divorce on the grounds of bigamy and abandonment. The court approved the request, and a hearing was held in the Fourth Court at 9:00 AM on the 24th of last month. The plaintiff and her lawyer, Zhu Chengxun, were present on time, but the defendant was absent. After questioning, the presiding judge found that there was indeed a reason for the divorce. On the afternoon of the 28th, he announced the judgment, stating that the marriage between the plaintiff and the defendant was approved to be dissolved, and the litigation costs were to be borne by the defendant. It is also reported that Song said that Fang's actions were illegal and that she planned to ask the court to issue an arrest warrant for Fang and punish him for bigamy and abandonment.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Respected Editor,</p>
<p>Today's edition of your newspaper contains a news item in the local news section about shipping merchants lobbying to amend the Maritime Law. The points and significance of the proposed amendments were generally accurate. However, the representatives went to Beijing in response to a summons from the Ministry of Transportation to attend a joint meeting of the Ministries of Transportation, Finance, and Navy regarding this matter, as the three ministries were tasked by the Executive Yuan to deliberate and respond. Therefore, the aforementioned meeting was specifically convened. The representatives were not solely petitioning, and thus did not have an audience with Minister Zhu. The representatives who attended were Chen Fuchen, Wei Wenhan, and Chen Bogang. Your newspaper mistakenly identified Chen Fuchen as Chen Shuntong, and Chen Bogang is the Secretary-General of our association, not an executive committee member. We are submitting this letter to clarify and request a correction to ensure accuracy. We would be grateful for your attention.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Reader's Advice</p>
<p>How to Go to the Frontier to Farm?</p>
<p>| Letter from Xiang Qing Jun |</p>
<p>Please provide detailed instructions on this matter. I wish to go to the Northwest or Northeast to farm, but I am facing the following difficulties: (1) I am unfamiliar with the routes, and travel expenses are difficult. (2) Even if I manage to reach the destination, I will be unfamiliar with both the people and the place. How can I find work? (3) Chinese people have a strong sense of community. Even if I can find farming work as I wish, will I be excluded by the local gangs? (4) I have heard that Shanghai has a Northwest Reclamation Corps. I wonder if I can join it? There are no articles of association for this corps, so I do not know how many procedures are required to join. I am a high school graduate who cannot afford to continue my studies. It is very difficult to find work in inland China, so I aspire to go to the Northwest or Northeast. In recent years, there have been many troubles on the borders because Chinese people are unwilling to go to the frontier. But it is not that Chinese people are unwilling to go, but because the people and land there are unfamiliar, and it is difficult to live safely. I hope you will not hesitate to advise me!</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Recently, the call to "go to the frontier" has been rising. This call hides the contradictions of social relations: (1) China's rural areas are increasingly bankrupt due to the intrusion of capitalist capital and the development of urban industry, the civil wars of warlords, and poor governance. This has led to a relative surplus of population in the countryside. Although urban industry has developed relatively, national industries ultimately cannot compete with the dumping of goods by imperialists and are forced to decline. This has led to a relative surplus of population in the cities. Due to the opposite surplus of population in cities and rural areas, the social panic is increasingly difficult to reverse. As a result, some people are loudly shouting "go to the frontier," intending to use the frontier as a tail to absorb the unemployed workers and peasants of the mainland to alleviate the panic. (2) Some young people cannot find jobs in inland society and do not pursue the fundamental causes of unemployment, so they have the dream of "going to the frontier." You are one of these people. "Because I cannot afford to continue my studies and it is very difficult to find work in inland China, I aspire to go to the Northwest or Northeast." This kind of thinking is cowardly and opportunistic, a thought of fleeing the battlefield. It should be known that finding work in inland China is indeed not easy, but "going to the frontier to farm" is even more difficult. You do not have the courage to struggle in inland Chinese society, so you will have even less strength to go to the frontier to farm. Moreover, you also know that the current frontier is: "In recent years, there have been many troubles on the borders." The so-called many troubles on the borders mean that the West has Britain coveting Tibet, the East has Japanese imperialism invading Liaoning and Mongolia, and the North has the influence of the Soviet revolution extending to Outer Mongolia, which is what ordinary people call "reddening." Then going to the Northeast and Northwest is even more difficult, isn't it? However, we are not absolutely opposed to everyone "going to the frontier," but there must be one condition: the politics and society of mainland China must be fairly clear before our going to the frontier has meaning. Otherwise, I want to ask: what are you going to do in the frontier? The Volunteer Army is freezing to death, starving to death, fighting desperately on the battlefield. Although the newspapers are also heavily publishing announcements of donations to the Volunteer Army or some small donations, it is ultimately a drop in the bucket, what good is it? However, the reason for this phenomenon is not in the frontier, but in the mainland. If the mainland is not properly managed, the frontier will only shrink by hundreds of miles every day, entrusting it to the enemy under the name of "long-term resistance." What are you going to do in the frontier? To sum up what I said earlier, I will answer you in one sentence: it is indeed difficult to make a living in the mainland. Going to the frontier to farm is even more difficult. If the politics and society of the mainland are not clear, going to the frontier is meaningless. Young people with ambition must first have the spirit of building strongholds and fighting to the death in the mainland, and should not have the thought of escaping the world.</p>

<p>Jiang Menglin Goes to Beijing</p>
<p>To Discuss Educational Funding for Tianjin and Peking During the National Crisis</p>
<p>Plans to Visit Cai Yuanpei in Shanghai to Report on Recent Developments at Peking University</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peking) Jiang Menglin, the president of Peking University, took the Peking-Pukou train to Beijing at 5:15 PM on the 1st. More than 20 people saw him off at the station, including Wang Lie, Hu Shi, Zheng Tianting, and Fan Jichang. Before leaving Peking, Mr. Jiang met with reporters and spoke as follows:</p>
<p>My intention to go to Beijing dates back to the winter vacation. At that time, I was unable to go due to various engagements. Now that Peking University has just begun its semester, it is necessary to consult the Ministry of Education on all school affairs. Currently, the situation in Rehe is tense. It is still necessary to discuss with Minister Song and Minister Zhu (Jiahua) whether the educational funds can be remitted on a monthly basis. When Minister Song was in Peking, he declared that no matter what the situation, the funding for higher education in Peking and Tianjin would never be in arrears, which shows Minister Song's enthusiasm for protecting education. I expect that after this trip to Beijing, the educational funds will be further guaranteed. As for the current situation at Peking University, professors are teaching on time, students are studying diligently, and the atmosphere on campus is quite calm. Our school advocates raising the level of students. The library and laboratory are always crowded. However, due to financial difficulties, construction projects are difficult to carry out, which is a shortcoming. I will stay in Beijing for about a week and plan to go to Shanghai to visit Mr. Cai (Yuanpei) to report on the recent developments at Peking University because Mr. Cai is concerned about Peking University. During my absence from Peking, the school affairs will be handled by the Secretariat, and important matters will be discussed by the School Affairs Committee.</p>

<p>Peking Normal University Is Not Preparing to Move to Xi'an</p>
<p>| Three Deans Express Unanimous Opposition to Relocating the Campus Westward |</p>
<p>| Li Zheng Cables the Ministry of Education That the Normal University Cannot Be Moved Independently |</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peking) After news of the establishment of Peking Normal University in Xi'an spread, President Li Zheng and Secretary Yi Jia have repeatedly stated that they have not received a formal order from the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education has not made any explicit announcements either. Although the education community has paid special attention to this issue, there is no way to know the truth. The reporter went to the Normal University to inquire about everything. The situation of all parties is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Cable from the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>Acting Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, based on a telegram from Yang Hucheng, Chairman of Shaanxi Province, welcoming the relocation of the Normal University to Xi'an, urgently cabled Li Zheng, President of National Peking Normal University, to discuss the issue of relocating the campus to the west. The gist of the original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>"To Li Zheng, President of Peking Normal University,</p>
<p>Chairman Yang of Shaanxi Province has telegraphed, stating that he welcomes the relocation of Peking Normal University to Xi'an and will allocate a campus site and make all necessary arrangements when the school sends personnel to Shaanxi to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Now that the situation in Tianjin and Peking is tense, the Normal University is finding it difficult to operate. How should we proceed? We are consulting with you in advance to prepare for the relocation." (Excerpt)</p>
<p>Signed, Zhu Jiahua, Acting Minister of Education</p>
<p>▲ Li Zheng's Reply</p>
<p>After receiving the cable from the Ministry of Education, Li Zheng, President of the Normal University, immediately sent a confidential reply, the gist of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"To Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education in Nanjing,</p>
<p>I have received and read your cable with respect. I am very grateful for Chairman Yang's welcome to the westward relocation of the Normal University. However, Xi'an is not as good as Peking. All material facilities and transportation are far inferior to Peking. If the Central Government has an overall plan, the Normal University is willing to follow all the universities in relocating westward together. Otherwise, the Normal University cannot be relocated independently. I earnestly request that you consider the importance of normal education and make it a priority not to relocate. If there are problems with the situation in Tianjin and Peking, all universities should be relocated together." (Excerpt)</p>
<p>Respectfully, Li Zheng, President of National Peking Normal University</p>
<p>▲ Deans' Meeting</p>
<p>At 12:00 noon on the 1st, Li Zheng, President of the Normal University, convened a temporary discussion meeting of the deans in the president's office. Those present included President Li Zheng, Dean of the Faculty of Arts Li Jinxi, Dean of the Faculty of Science Liu Tuo, Dean of the Faculty of Education Li Jianxun, Secretary Yi Jia, and Wang Ruchuan. President Li Zheng reported on the cable from the Ministry of Education, which confirmed the intention to relocate the Normal University. He asked for an exchange of opinions on how to proceed. The results were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Dean of the Faculty of Arts Li Jinxi argued that the Normal University should not be relocated westward because it would be difficult to move the library.</p>
<p>(2) Dean of the Faculty of Science Liu Tuo argued that it was not possible to relocate westward at this time unless the Central Government solved all the problems related to the relocation costs and all the disadvantages to the Normal University. It would be even more difficult to move the Faculty of Science's instruments and specimens.</p>
<p>(3) Dean of the Faculty of Education Li Jianxun argued that it was extremely difficult to relocate the Normal University to Xi'an because it would be very inconvenient for students to practice and visit.</p>
<p>(4) A school affairs meeting will be convened regularly to discuss the method. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Li Zheng's Remarks</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, the reporter visited Li Zheng, President of the Normal University, to inquire about the truth of the relocation issue. He spoke as follows:</p>
<p>"In late last month, the newspaper reported that the Normal University would be relocated to Xi'an. I did not believe it and thought it was a misunderstanding. When Secretary Yi (Jia) was in Beijing, he met with Vice Minister Duan (Xipeng). Duan said that the Normal University would not be relocated, but the Normal University would decide its own method depending on the situation in Tianjin and Peking. Yesterday, I received a confidential cable from Minister Zhu, asking me to prepare for the westward relocation and soliciting my consent. It turned out that the Ministry of Education had not determined the relocation of the Normal University to Xi'an. As of now, no order has been received in Peking. In fact, there are various difficulties in the westward relocation of the Normal University. Xi'an is far inferior to Peking in terms of material, transportation, and culture. I have already sent a letter to Minister Zhu expressing my opinion. I have now sent another cable, stating that if the Ministry of Education has an overall plan, the Normal University will definitely follow all the universities in relocating together. Otherwise, the Normal University cannot be relocated independently. If the situation is serious, there are many more important institutions than the Normal University. Why must the Normal University be relocated westward first? Moreover, the school spirit of our school is now better than that of other universities. Since the Japanese army occupied Yuguan, the situation in Tianjin and Peking has been particularly tense. People in Tianjin and Peking feel uneasy and panicked. Under these circumstances, maintaining normalcy is extremely difficult. However, the Normal University has not lost its normalcy. According to the Registration Office, only one-tenth of the students did not participate in the semester examination before the winter vacation. Many people were rushing to escape at that time. Only our school was calm. This proves that the school spirit of the Normal University has improved and there is no reason to relocate to Xi'an."</p>
<p>Government Affairs of the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>The recent government affairs of the Ministry of Education are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) A response was given to the Jiangsu Provincial Government approving the various rules for the graduation examinations of primary and secondary school students in Jiangsu Province. In the future, the regulations submitted to the Ministry for record by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education should be sent to the Ministry by the supervisor for compliance.</p>
<p>(2) An order was given to the Board of Trustees of Jiangnan College, approving their request to gradually conclude the school's affairs over a period of years. Since there are already many schools in Shanghai that have a business school or department, there is no need to establish another one.</p>
<p>Cheng Tianfang Cables the Central Government to Quickly Appoint a Successor to Zhejiang University</p>
<p>Since President Cheng Tianfang of Zhejiang University was reassigned to be the Director of the Department of Education of Hubei Province, the school affairs and funding of the university have been in danger of stalling. Secretary-General Shen Fu felt it was difficult to maintain the university's operations. In addition to requesting the Zhejiang Provincial Government to find ways to raise funds, he also cabled Cheng Tianfang, asking him to request the government to quickly appoint a new president so that someone would be responsible and the school affairs would not be interrupted. Yesterday, Mr. Ouyang Xianyi, Secretary of the school, received a cable from Mr. Cheng from Hubei, which said, "It was not my intention to leave Zhejiang for Hubei this time. I have already urged the Central Government to quickly appoint a successor to avoid delays."</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Orders the Closure of North China College</p>
<p>North China College, a private college in Peking, was approved for temporary registration by the Ministry of Education two years ago and was given a deadline of one year to gradually improve the various points that needed improvement. If it failed to comply within the deadline, its registration would be revoked immediately. By July of last year, the deadline had expired. The Ministry of Education sent personnel to inspect the college. According to the report, North China College had been able to slightly curb student absenteeism in the past year. However, the students' level was still low, most of the teachers were part-time and received very low pay. The extension department and various correspondence courses had been cancelled, but other specialized courses still existed. The library had not increased its collection significantly. Except for the addition of dormitories, there were no special improvements in various facilities. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Education ordered the Peking Municipal Bureau of Education to revoke the registration. Yesterday, it also replied to Yi Peiji, saying, "The Ministry has repeatedly received orders from the Executive Yuan to forward the Central Government's resolution to ban liberal arts and law departments, so it has ordered North China College to close as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Key News from the Chinese Social Education Society</p>
<p>▲ Pilot Expanded Mass Education Experimental Zone</p>
<p>▲ Joining the World Association for Adult Education</p>
<p>The Chinese Social Education Society has been established for more than a year. The society's affairs have been developing rapidly. More than 600 leading figures in the education community have joined the society. Recently, there has been an enthusiastic response to requests for membership. According to the person in charge of the society, the society has mostly been engaged in static work in the past, such as planning and design. In the future, it will shift to dynamic work. The fourth meeting of the board of directors will be held on March 18 at the Nanjing Mass Education Hall of Jiangsu Province. This meeting will decide on a pilot large-scale mass education experimental zone, join the World Association for Adult Education, and pass important cases such as new members, soliciting new members, and handing over the third board of directors.</p>
<p>In addition, the office of the Board of Directors of the Society has issued notices for the meeting because it is not easy to gather all the directors who are scattered in various provinces.</p>
<p>Students of Jiangsu Women's Normal School Donate Funds to Save the Country</p>
<p>Since the September 18 Incident, the students of Suzhou Women's Normal School in Jiangsu Province have enthusiastically participated in patriotic movements, such as raising funds to donate to the Northeast Volunteer Army. Recently, in view of the urgency of the national crisis, and the front-line soldiers' willingness to serve the country, it is necessary to provide them with material assistance. However, raising funds is time-consuming, and abandoning studies goes against the idea of saving the country through education. Therefore, each student voluntarily saves pocket money and donates one yuan each. All 400 students in the school have reportedly raised funds equal to the number of students, which will be transferred to the bank for emergency needs.</p>

<p>The Railway Department Revises the General Rules for Internships of Jiaotong University Graduates</p>
<p>▲ Instructions Have Been Issued to the School</p>
<p>The National Jiaotong University received instructions from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, which stated, "In order to comply with the instructions, the internship diaries and internship reports of the interns from various railway lines are largely the same in content. The students prepare a diary and a report each month, which inevitably duplicates work and wastes time. The General Rules for Internships of Jiaotong University Graduates, the Detailed Rules for Internships, and the Rules of the Jiaotong University Internship Examination Committee are revised and implemented. The format of the internship diary and the general report are revised and promulgated. In the future, the students should fill in the diary daily during the internship period, collect it at the end of the month, and attach a summary of the internship matters to report once a month. When the internship period expires, they should still send a general report once to examine the experience of the entire internship. In addition to sending separate orders, the revised General Rules for Internships of Jiaotong University Graduates, the Detailed Rules for Internships, the Rules of the Jiaotong University Internship Examination Committee, and the revised format of the internship diary and the general report are enclosed in duplicate, so that the school can be informed and forwarded to the Tangshan and Peking campuses for information.

<p>Free Talk: Students</p>
<p>During the May Fourth and May Thirtieth Movements, young students were truly in the limelight. At that time, there were two distinct views on students: one was praise, with the most enthusiastic hoping that students would shoulder the entire responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation; the other was condemnation, with the extreme being to weep and lament over "[the nation's misfortune, to have such monstrous students]."</p>
<p>Later, the title of "student" gradually faded from attention because it was said that national affairs could not ultimately be entrusted to young students and that the old revolutionaries who had strived for decades were still needed to continue their efforts. By the time Sun Chuanfang's swordsmen massacred young people in Shanghai and thereafter, the title of "student" reached its nadir. At this time, the general public's view of students also changed: students were ultimately useless!</p>
<p>Then, the Mukden Incident occurred. Within three days, the Northeast fell into enemy hands. Just as [non-resistance], [calmness], and [appeals to the League of Nations] were being carried out with great fanfare, suddenly, an alarm was raised: "[The student movement is coming]!" Students from the South petitioned in the capital, and students from the North also wanted to go South. That fiery and hot situation really made people feel it was more serious than the fall of the Northeast. However, the general criticism at this time was quite negative; students at this time only earned the bad reputation of being [rashly agitated and manipulated]. Even the most lenient arguments believed that students were more likely to spoil things than to accomplish them. After the January 28th Shanghai Incident, I personally heard an old gentleman angrily say, "It's all the students' fault! But when the Japanese soldiers came, the students had already run away, leaving the common people to suffer." This sentence truly represents the criticism of students by many kindhearted people. Recently, many accusations against students and the orders to evacuate essentially echo the old gentleman's words. They either label students as [troublemakers] or see them as superhuman beings with three heads and six arms who are not afraid of swords and guns.</p>
<p>It seems that many people still don't understand the basic fact that students are intellectuals, not soldiers! Thus, in this [state of discontent], the title of "student" has once again reached its lowest point.</p>
<p>[Liberation] and [Conservatism]</p>
<p>The Republic of China gave us an unparalleled act of great merit: liberating women's feet. The ultimate goal of this liberation is not in enlarging bound feet, but in advocating naturally developed feet. Girls who have unbound their feet are inevitably transitional figures. After the reform, the standard of beauty naturally lies in small, unbound feet. This is something that everyone in the new era must acknowledge.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy reform that followed the change in political system is the New Literature Movement. The transitional period of this movement involved writing new ideas in old classical Chinese. However, the ultimate goal we reached was vernacular Chinese that is free from formal restrictions and naturally expressed. Unexpectedly, twenty years after this New Literature Movement, just as everyone was waiting for the emergence of a vital new literary work to complete our mission, a heavy fog suddenly obscured our new literature. This is the retro movement of a group of so-called "new literati" (?). Besides newspapers, many of the most widely read magazines are using classical Chinese particles like "zhi, hu, ye, zhe"; even individual collections contain many old phrases and old poems. At this time, among the emerging "[lyricists]" (?), someone named Zeng felt that simply reverting to the past was inappropriate, so he advocated a so-called lyric liberation movement. I am someone who knows classical literature and loves to read lyrics, but I am dissatisfied with their rigid style. Now that Zeng has come to liberate them, the ultimate goal should naturally be to break the rigid rhyme schemes and rhyme patterns of lyrics. However, Zeng has not done this. He still retains the old-fashioned form, simply replacing some of the more poetic lines with a few vulgar expressions and swear words. To call this liberation is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Equally famous as Zeng, who advocates liberation, is a conservative "[lyricist]" (?). That is a Mr. Zhang, the author of "Something-lou Lyrics." Someone named Yu once published a series of reading notes in each issue of "Something Teahouse, Volume One," discussing Zhang's "Something-lou Lyrics." Yu said, "[The orthodox tradition of Chinese lyrics is Li Houzhu, which was directly passed down to Nalan Xingde in the Qing Dynasty before ending. People who generally discuss lyrics in China particularly value this orthodox school. 'Something-lou Lyrics' naturally belongs to the orthodox school. It is precisely a reappearance of the orthodox school." I also agree with this. Zhang is indeed a successor to Nalan Xingde. If Nalan is said to be from the orthodox school, then Zhang naturally is too. If readers don't believe it, take a look at the following two 'Waves Washing Sand' poems:</p>
<p>Night rain forms autumn, settling right on the heart, teaching one to cherish and protect its romantic charm. Ultimately, for whom does it add to illness? And for whom does it bring shame? The secret intent has not ceased; the secret wish is difficult to fulfill. The pearl curtain is rolled up four times, the moon over the building. Secretly recalling the joyous time, it is truly like a dream; even in a dream, one must stay. | By Nalan Xingde.</p>
<p>Evening rain drips into sorrow, sorrow settling on the heart. A lifetime of troubles for romantic charm. Always adding to illness because of longing, illness is also worthy of shame. A person is at the low wall; a private wish is difficult to fulfill. What matter is one leaning on the tall building in the deep night? Walking together in the snow is entirely like a dream; even in a dream, it is difficult to stay. | By Zhang</p>
<p>If we read the above two poems side by side, we will know that Zhang indeed belongs to the orthodox school. Because Zhang is afraid of losing the orthodox tradition, he dares not change the rhyme patterns of the original poem much; he even dares not change the words much!</p>
<p>Yang Qiu Notes: Zeng and Zhang were originally "birds of a feather"; there is no distinction between "liberation" and "conservatism." They are equally capable of plagiarism. If you don't believe it, just look at how Zeng changed Wan Qiyan's line from the Song Dynasty, "[Where is the capital, covered by evening clouds?]" to "[Where is my home, covered by white clouds?]" and even boasted that it was a successful and beautiful line.</p>
<p>So-called "Lyric Liberation" Experts</p>
<p>I remember Sinclair said something like this in his book "The Golden Age": America is full of gold, it just depends on how you take it. As long as you are famous in some way, theaters will invite you to perform, and movie companies will invite you to film. Thus, your name becomes famous, and you gain profit. Therefore, modern America has produced a large group of celebrities. There are celebrities for swimming across the English Channel, celebrities for dancing the longest, celebrities for eating the most, celebrities for drinking the most, and so on.</p>
<p>How is it different in our China, under the control of the desire for gold? However, our China is, after all, an ancient civilized country. Becoming famous by eating, drinking, etc., is too ignoble in the eyes of our educated gentlemen. If we want to become famous, we have to think in terms of promoting Chinese culture. Thus, in recent years, there have emerged experts in Scandinavian literature, experts in New Russian literature, experts in Sinclair, and so on. And the most recent and newest product is the so-called "lyric liberation movement." Perhaps this originator will soon become an expert! No, they have already become an expert. It is said that they can even be passed down for eternity! But unfortunately, what's the point of having fame after death? How do you take the gold then?</p>
<p>In the end, what has the liberation of lyrics liberated? I am not fortunate enough to have read their "special issue," so I don't know much. I have only read what Mr. Yang Qiu has respectfully recorded in this publication. Judging from these two poems, the form is still there, and the rhyme scheme is still there. What exactly has been liberated? The language? Let's take a look! In these two poems, there are words such as "desolate," "red makeup," "Central Plains," and "Jiangnan." Even if Tang Dynasty lyricists were brought back from the underworld, they wouldn't need to loudly advocate the liberation of lyrics before being able to use these words, right?</p>
<p>However, in these poems, there are phrases like "playing mahjong" and "damn it," which were never seen in previous lyrics. Perhaps this is the liberation of lyrics. Oh, that's right. It turns out that these liberation experts specialize in "playing mahjong." When they are called upon to liberate, all they can do is say "damn it." No wonder the old gentlemen shake their heads and sigh, saying that new ideas are worse than floods and wild beasts!</p>
<p>Writing to this point, I am again reminded of our favorite game. That is, doing something and then finding a reason for it. Whether we do something bad or something good, we can always find a grand and righteous excuse to prove that we are always right. So if you say that those lyric liberation experts are saying "damn it," they will at least fight you to the death. But if you say that they are "engaged in the liberation of lyrics," then you can be sure that this sentence will be printed on the back of their books in the so-called "collection of good reviews."</p>
<p>In "Guangji of Laughing Forest," there is a story about a schoolteacher farting and poking a hole. The master advises him to just fart, there's no need to be so rigid. This master is very understanding. He knows that farting is a bodily necessity and unavoidable, so he will never say "you can't fart"!</p>
<p>I also know that the writing of these "experts" is a "[bodily necessity, unavoidable]." So if they want to fart, let them fart. If they want to be passed down for eternity, let them be passed down for eternity. I won't see it, and the author won't see it either. But my advice to them is, why must you be so "rigid" and even call it "lyric liberation"?</p>
<p>Yang Qiu Notes: Zeng's so-called "liberation" is precisely the "liberation" of "farting and poking a hole."</p>
<p>Shaw's Corner</p>
<p>O sacred buffoon, gazing upon this ancient soil, your old eyes might wonder at such a peculiar medieval age enacting “Mysteries”! Or perhaps not… Only a scene of Confucianism and Taoism emerges in the mist; and the splendor of the Tang Dynasty; and the “morality” of culture, existing but not growing, cut off midway. Before long, another act of a wearying tragicomedy will begin; its conductor, look… The opening is beckoning… That is the door of Death… Although not as swift as dreams, we have parted ways with chaos. Gazing at the mountains, seven-tiered, and the heavens, nine-layered, in movement.</p>
<p>Black Girl Seeks the Gods (17)</p>
<p>By George Bernard Shaw, translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>"You feel that the color of *** is bustling; but that is really as meaningless as the color of swallows," another lady said.</p>
<p>"You don't need to answer such sophistry," an authoritative gentleman said. "These are tricks like those with three playing cards. I am a surgeon; I know a clearly observed fact: the diameter of blood vessels supplying blood to the female brain is larger than the standard diameter of blood vessels in the male brain. Therefore, the resulting congestion disturbs the imagination and excessively stimulates it. This produces illusions, in which pepper, spiciness implies heat, the sound of high intervals implies height, and *** beauty implies bustling."</p>
<p>"Your scholarly manner is truly remarkable, Duke Stowe," the first gentleman said. "But that is beside the point I was making. What I was saying is that whether the heat of the sun is the heat of pepper or the heat of flames, and whether the cold of the moon is a kind of coldness of ice or a kind of coldness of snobbish friends treating poor relatives, in short, the sun and the moon seem to be inhabited, just like the Earth."</p>
<p>"The coldest places on Earth are not inhabited," Mr. Crocker said.</p>
<p>"The hottest places are inhabited," the first gentleman said. "If the Earth did not give us various conveniences in more suitable climates, then the coldest places would probably also be inhabited. Besides, Antarctica has penguins. Why wouldn't there be fire scorpions in the sun? Those ancestors of ours who believed in the sulfurous hell knew that what they called the soul, which leaves the body when the body dies and becomes the difference between life and death, can live forever in flames. In this regard, they are much more scientific than our friend Crocker here."</p>
<p>"People who believe in hell will believe in anything," Mr. Crocker said, "especially in the inheritance of acquired habits."</p>
<p>"I think you believe in evolution, Crocker," said a gentleman, a naturalist in the tour group.</p>
<p>"I do believe in evolution," Mr. Crocker said excitedly. "Do you take me for a fundamentalist?"</p>
<p>"If you believe in evolution," the naturalist said, "you must believe that all habits are acquired and inherited. However, you still have Eden in your blood. You people accept new ideas but don't think of abandoning old ideas. This way of doing things makes you a danger to the public. You are all fundamentalists fertilized with science. That's why you are the most foolish conservatives and reactionaries in politics, and the most stubborn obstructionists in science itself. Whenever something starts, you all have the same view: stop it, whip it, hang it, bomb it, destroy it."</p>
<p>"All the same view!" the first lady exclaimed. "Have they ever agreed on anything?"</p>
<p>"Currently, they are all looking in the same direction," said the lady with a satirical expression.</p>
<p>"Which direction?" the first lady said.</p>
<p>"That direction," said the satirical lady, pointing at the black girl.</p>
<p>"Are you still here?" the first lady said. "I told you to go! Go!"</p>
<p>The black girl did not answer. She stared deeply at the lady, letting "Norbert Cairn" warm between her fingers. Immediately, she glanced at the mathematical lady and said, "Where does this come from?"</p>
<p>"What comes from where?" said the mathematical lady.</p>
<p>"That root you were talking about," the black girl said loudly. "The square root of Mynas Sex."</p>
<p>"It comes from the mind," the lady said. "It's a number. Can you count from one?"</p>
<p>"One, two, three, four, five, isn't it?" the black girl said, bending her fingers.</p>
<p>"Exactly," the lady said. "Now count backwards from one."</p>

<p>Negotiations on the Issue of Arms Embargo to Be Held Again</p>
<p>(London) Guo Taiqi, the Chinese representative to the League of Nations, will return to his position as envoy to London. The recent expression of the Chinese three representatives to the League of Nations to the Nanjing government has been interpreted by Chinese figures here as indicating dissatisfaction with China's method of resistance in Rehe or that Zhang Xueliang's organization of resistance is not very resolute, causing Chinese representatives abroad to be discouraged. Chinese figures also said that Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant may be difficult to invoke in the future. Regarding the British ban on arms shipments to the Far East, regardless of the aggressor and the invaded country, although it has not been heard that the Chinese side has any formal protest, the Chinese chargé d'affaires in London has met with Simon twice and plans to visit for the third time tomorrow.

<p>Filthy Conduct of a Japanese Army Captain in the Puppet State</p>
<p>Defrauding Over 100,000 in Public Funds</p>
<p>And Taking Prostitutes on Pleasure Trips</p>
<p>Nagoya News reported: Ishihara Nobuyoshi, a captain in the cavalry of the South Xing'an Province Garrison Army in "Manchukuo" and a member of the accounting department, originally from Yamanaka Village, Nukata County, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, went to the South Xing'an Province Garrison Army in Qianjiadian, Zhengdao Line, Manchuria on September 7 last year to serve as a cavalry captain and accounting department member. On November 15 last year, he received 150,000 yuan in cash from the Changchun Military and Political Department, stayed at the North Manchuria Hotel in Yoshino-cho, and became intimate with two prostitutes in the hotel, Kikuchiyo and Kokiku, allowing the two prostitutes to freely use 5,903 yuan, 4 jiao, and 2 fen of public funds. He also remitted 1,000 yuan of public funds to his brother, Otaka Heitaro, and squandered it at will in Xinjing, Shenyang, Siping Street, Zhengjiatun, and other places, spending a total of over 7,800 yuan. Kikuchiyo and Kokiku also used the funds to escape from the brothel. The man then carried over 100,000 yuan in public funds, actually becoming a wealthy man, taking prostitutes on pleasure trips, and being extremely extravagant, thus gradually attracting public attention and exposing his crimes. The matter was discovered by the Changchun Japanese Military Police Detachment, which immediately arrested the suspect. A serious investigation is currently underway.</p>
<p>Italian Claim</p>
<p>Europe to Unite and Wage Commercial Warfare with Japan</p>
<p>Japanese Commercial Competition Has Now Reached the Mediterranean</p>
<p>Reuters Rome, 3rd: The Italian Chamber of Deputies today passed a report calling for a forty-eight-hour work week, stating that Europe must take united action to resist the harm of Japanese competition in Europe. Important parts of Italy's export trade, such as cotton goods, silk goods, rayon goods, and woolen goods, are now gradually being displaced by irresistible Japanese competition. Japanese competition has now reached the Mediterranean and even Italian colonies. At the same time, the danger of gradual industrialization in several places within China must also be taken into account. Take Shanghai as an example, where new-style factories run by Japanese and Europeans produce products under labor conditions unattainable in Europe. Its terrifying competition now extends to goods of good quality.</p>
<p>Bavarian People's Party</p>
<p>Releases Restoration Declaration</p>
<p>Growing Worries About Germany's Future</p>
<p>Reuters Berlin, 4th: A royalist declaration was published today in the Bavarian People's Party's newspaper, stating that the turmoil of domestic politics in recent weeks has aroused unprecedented longing for the monarch. Today, only the monarch can be the protector of the rights of the people and the inviolability of the State of Bavaria. Furthermore, this is not only an expression of respect for the current Crown Prince Rupprecht but also a subtle sign of the people's awareness of the seriousness of the current situation. Although the author stated that the ideal of restoration is not intended to cause difficulties for the central government, if implemented, it will inevitably involve many concerns between the State of Bavaria and the central government.</p>
<p>Armed German Election</p>
<p>Twenty-One Foreign Journalists Arrested</p>
<p>Reuters Berlin, 3rd: The German government is now generously providing grain accounts to help social and communist parties that are experiencing extreme difficulties, and suspects that its purpose is only to win the support of voters. The government has ordered that tens of thousands of tons of butter and 35,000 tons of rye be handed over to local officials in Upper Silesia, Thuringia, the Ruhr, East Prussia, and Berlin for free distribution to the poor. On Sunday's election day, troops will parade in front of President Hindenburg to show respect. At that time, 25,000 members of the Stahlhelm will participate in brown uniforms and will engage in a slight parade.</p>
<p>Reuters Berlin, 3rd: Twenty-one people, including the foreign news editor of the Social Democratic newspaper Vorwärts, Hidi, have been arrested on charges of conspiring to resist the government. The most severe punishment for them will be the death penalty. There is also a theory that the editor-in-chief of Vorwärts was arrested on March 2nd, but his whereabouts are still unknown. The authorities have denied arresting him and stated that the police are currently searching for him. It was recently reported that a communist leader who fled to Denmark was arrested in his Berlin residence today. Today, the authorities offered a reward of 5,000 gold yuan for reports detailing the arson of the Reichstag.</p>
<p>Havas Berlin, 3rd: Chancellor Hitler attacked Bolshevism in a speech last night about the domestic situation in the Soviet Union. Soviet diplomatic circles were shocked upon hearing this. The Soviet ambassador to Germany immediately telegraphed Hitler's speech to Moscow, fearing that the Soviet government would respond. According to the report, when German Foreign Minister Neurath met with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov yesterday, he distinguished between the Nazi Party's treatment of the German Communist Party and the German government's attitude toward the Soviet Union. Neurath also stated that Chancellor Hitler himself also strongly desires Germany and Russia to maintain friendship. Unexpectedly, Hitler suddenly gave a speech against Bolshevism. Soviet figures were thus not only dissatisfied but also very surprised. They all said that the path followed by Germany's foreign policy is now becoming clearer.</p>
<p>Havas Berlin, 3rd: It was rumored yesterday that German Communist leader Thalmann had fled to the capital of Denmark. In reality, he was sheltering in a carpenter's home and was arrested today.</p>
<p>Sun Ke Talks</p>
<p>He Yingqin Flew to Beiping Yesterday</p>
<p>Li Liejun, Huang Shaoxiong, and Others Accompanied</p>
<p>He Receives Central Government Mandate to Preside Over Military Affairs</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, accompanied by legislators Chuan Bingchang, Lü Guang, and others, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing by train at 11:20 PM last night. The purpose of this trip is to attend the final meeting of the preparatory committee of the Sun Yat-sen Culture and Education Center to discuss various closing matters and various preparations for the founding ceremony of the Sun Yat-sen Culture Center to be held in Nanjing on the 12th. Reporters from various newspapers went to Sun's residence on Columbia Road at 11:00 AM this morning to visit. A breakdown of Sun's remarks is as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Resignation of the Three Representatives</p>
<p>The reporter first inquired about the reasons for the resignation of our three representatives to the League of Nations. Sun replied that our three representatives to the League of Nations had telegraphed their resignation to Nanjing, and after the central government's consolation, it is no longer an issue. As for the reasons for the resignation, it is actually that the current position of our country emphasizes military resistance, and diplomatic activities are relatively secondary. The resignation of the three representatives clearly expresses the need to awaken the country to a unified determination to resist Japan and to avoid any reliance on momentary peace, which would put the country and the nation in a place from which it could never recover.</p>
<p>Situation of Rehe and North China Authorities</p>
<p>Sun also stated that regarding the war in Rehe, in terms of military equipment and various facilities, we are inferior to the enemy. In terms of the offensive and defensive situation and the geographical advantages, defense is easier and attack is difficult. Therefore, the question of whether Rehe can be defended depends entirely on the determination of the military officers in the North and whether the soldiers obey orders. The government should provide as much support as possible.</p>
<p>As for the central government's financial and material support issues, we should try our best to raise and transport them to the front lines. In terms of finance, the financial authorities have already raised and paid it. Other aspects, such as inconvenient transportation, make transportation slightly difficult. This is the result of too little attention being paid to national defense in the past, resulting in the pain of temporary measures today.</p>
<p>He, Huang, and Li Flew to Beiping Yesterday</p>
<p>Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin, Minister of Interior Huang Shaoxiong, and Central Committee Member Li Liejun flew to Beiping yesterday morning. It is rumored that they are under orders from the central government to preside over military affairs. As to whether they will go to the front lines to supervise the battle, a decision will be made after arriving in Beiping. As for the issue of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally going north, because the central military officials have already gone to Beiping, Chiang has no immediate news of going north.</p>
<p>Do Not Fall for Japanese Divisive Tactics</p>
<p>The reporter also asked about the news of Dong Brigade's surrender to the enemy on the Rehe front. Sun said that he could not really confirm this statement. It is said that Tang Yulin and Brigade Commander Dong had very deep disagreements in the past, but he firmly believes that during this serious military period, there will definitely be no more grievances. As for the talk about Sun Dianying surrendering and Tang compromising in Rehe, they are purely Japanese divisive tactics and should not be believed lightly.</p>
<p>Preliminary Draft of the Constitution</p>
<p>Sun also stated that regarding the drafting of the Constitution, the Constitutional Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan has stipulated a period and is proceeding step by step. As for the principles of the initial draft, they were passed at the meeting the day before yesterday, but these are assumed principles and will need to be formally studied in the future and the opinions of experts from all over the country will be solicited.</p>
<p>Director Wang's Return</p>
