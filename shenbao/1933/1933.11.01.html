<p>— 仁</p>
<p>昨日新任財長孔祥熙氏對新聞記者談話中。於國家財政計劃。有極懇切之解剖。培元開源一說。尤中肯要。所謂培元開源者。即孔氏所謂「求所開之源。有益於國。無害於民。庶幾所開者爲醴泉。否則不顧一切。徒求目前能增加收入。而不計人民負擔能力與所蒙影響。結果必致民生日困。而國家亦益陷窘境。則所開爲毒源或苦水」是也。</p>
<p>孔氏此言。不獨足以針砭中國今日財政之病。亦即爲吻合於財政原理之名言孔氏就任以後。究擬如何開源。以求培植人民之元氣。目前雖尙不得而知。然而揆之於今日之事實。所謂有傷元氣之開源稅收。正不知有若干種之存在。即以孔氏談話中所舉之田賦一項論。已極明顯爲負擔不平衡之稅收。鹽稅一項。亦類乎是。蓋食鹽之消耗。不問貧富。其消耗量均屬相等。譬如貧者日食鹽二分之一合。則富者亦必爲日食二分之一合有時更較貧者爲減少故鹽稅之繳納。貧富均爲相等換言之。若貧富兩者所納之鹽稅。與其財産相一比較。則貧者所納鹽稅之比率。較之富者不知增大若干倍矣。諸如此類不平衡之租稅甚多。他若内地各種苛捐雜稅之有妨於人民之元氣者。更無待論。故今後孔氏旣注意於新源流之應顧及人民元氣。則對於舊源流之有傷於人民元氣者。亦應注意及之。此吾人之所以有感者一。</p>
<p>其次。孔氏談話中又謂「從事節流。」同時並謂。「節流須詳審實際情况」凡無益消耗之流。應力加堵塞正當之流。不但不應撙節。尤當使流益暢逹。」旨哉斯言。然而吾人環顧近二三年來之中央支出。除軍事費一項。因剿共工作緊要。不得不年有增加外其他各種經費。莫不極度縮减。以近數年之財政情狀論。政務費之緊縮。固爲不得已之事實。然在此不得已之中。似未可以一槪論建設與敎育二費爲國家立國之大本。國難無論嚴重至於如何程度。建設與敎育。豈能任其廢弛。建設之應重視。孔氏談話中已論及之。至於敎育一端。唯其爲國難之日趨嚴重。更不能稍形放鬆。敎育爲國家人材之建設機關。倘以財政艱難而遂因陋就簡。則敎者不安於敎。而學者亦不安於學。其結果人民將日趨於無智。而國難終難有望於舒展矣。此吾人之所以有感者二。</p>
<p>綜之今日中國財政。誠已至百孔千瘡之時。孔氏於此艱難之中。出任大責。吾人深望其能抱定所宣示之方針。以發展今後政治上之新猷。</p>

<p>汪氏謂、宋氏辭財長及行政院副院長職、决定甚早、惟以繼任人選及各項凖備未週、恐發生影響、故未對外發表、本人原擬早日來滬、後以接宋氏來電、稱在辭職未决定繼任人選以前、請勿來滬、後將先生來京、因又躭擱一日、至今日始能來滬、現已兩度晤及宋氏、敦勸宋氏主持經濟委員會事務宋氏表示、現正忙於財部交代、近日不克晋京、一俟各項事務就緒、當即赴京、經委會常會、必須三常委共同出席、始可開會、故本人曁孫哲生先生、尙稍待宋氏入京也、</p>

<p>記者詢以外間傳汪氏有消極說、究竟確否、汪氏當答謂、總之、負責國事、實極困難、本人自今春四月至現在、態度完全未變、現在政務紛繁如是、當局者時感措置困難、如有人能有更好辦法、願來負責、吾人隨時均可擺脫、否則當竭力圖維持現局、此時如果驟然引退、豈不陷國家於更難之境、是必非忠心爲國者所爲也、</p>

<p>記者又詢以外傳宋氏辭職原因、與外交問題有關、究竟内容如何、汪氏答稱、此一問題、甚願與諸君一述、按國民政府自九一八以來、外交方針、始終祇有一條路可走、此方針之决定、完全據事實而來、方針旣祇一個、當然無所謂外交問題上之意見的爭執、現在所持外交方針、就是整理内政·充實國力然後始可言外交我國對遠東及世界和平、固力求維護、然求和平、必須先有實力、故在目前除充實國力外、實無第二個外交政策可言外傳宋氏此次辭職、因外交意見衝突云云、實非確詞、對日問題亦始終恪遵七月廿八日通電所列、决不承認滿洲僞國、决不割讓領土、别無他言矣、至謠傳羅部長之離職、爲某方威脅、亦絶無其事、</p>

<p>至於外間傳聞、蔣公使赴日、日使有吉入京酬酢、旋又北上、李擇一赴日、皆係事實是否即須開始直接交涉、及局部解决東北問題外間謠傳完全不確、日使赴京赴平、係照例接待、李擇一此去係私事、蔣爲返任、至北寗路通車通郵關稅等問題北平政委會、爲一地方行政機關、一切重大問題、皆聽命中央、通車問題屬於鐵道部、郵政問題屬於交通部、關稅問題屬於財政部、北平政委會有何權力、與日僞單獨交涉、同不辯可知、且郵政世界各國、亦不與僞國在來、豈有我國與之通郵乎、</p>

<p>宋財長辭職後、現由孔部長繼任、在民國十五年北伐時、宋赴武漢、孔氏即在粤代理財長、故孔部長對理財亦富有經騐、今日財政問題、固首重勦匪軍費、但决不挪用棉麥借欵、蓋棉麥借欵美金五千萬、合國幣僅一萬萬五六千萬元、且非現欵、然各省及中央各院部之請求撥欵者、達十一萬萬五千萬元之多、所擬計劃均甚切要、超出借欵七八倍、故政府一本原定計劃集中用於生産、萬不容流用於軍費也、至棉麥銷售、今後將由棉業糧食統制會主持辦理、今則因棉麥分批陸續來華、復須售出變爲現欵、故一切生産計劃尙未能迅速實行、</p>

<p>昨據接近孔部長之某要人談話謂宋部長辭職之後、上星期日中政會即任孔繼任、孔氏富於責任心、而於改進今日財政狀况、尤具熱忱、故雖受任於財政疲敝之秋、不敢徘徊瞻顧、毅然决定於一日即行接事、又云自宋辭職之說徵實以後、財部事務已陷於羣龍無首狀態、而金融界之不能穩定、尤爲不可韙飾之事實故孔氏明知難關重重、而於蔣汪宋力勸之後、即允不顧一切、勉任艱鉅、某要人又謂孔之施政方針、當以宋之已往成績爲藍本、蕭規曹隨、或易收效、財政部長孔祥熙氏</p>

<p>吉林義勇軍之數目據日本關東軍部九月十日發表、去年全滿義勇軍最多時期爲二十一萬、今年現時尙有九萬五千、去年義勇軍爲集團式、易于討伐、今年則化整爲零、頗難應付、去年全年戰鬥次數爲四八二次、今年由一月至八月已達三九六次、卽今年八月份内日軍將校以下之官佐死亡二十一員、傷四十六員、至日兵之傷亡、雖未發表數目、每次戰鬥、日軍多有傷亡、其數目則無從調查、日本軍部發表吉林各部義勇軍之數目、爲一萬八千六百七十餘名、另附表於後、但實際各部之數目、均較日軍部所發表者多在二倍以上、據僞國護路軍總司令于琛澂面稱、吉林一省義勇軍、總數在十萬以上、此數與吉禎所調查之數目甚爲符合、而滿洲報載中東路東段一帶有菲軍三百餘股、每股平均　在二百餘名以上、卽此一段、已在六萬餘人、</p>

<p>現在各部之義勇軍因有二年之經騐、故工作方法、亦較前完善、吉禎調查除陳崇仿與白沙會兩部、因據有吉林東北天然之形勢、其部隊尙爲集團式、此外　吉海·吉敦·吉長·及中東路各部之義勇軍、均爲零星分散、最多者每隊不過二三百名、行動敏捷、或襲擊日本兵營、或拆毁鐵路、卽吉禎在吉林省城調查時期、僅十二日之久、卽拆毁鐵路五次、（計吉海兩次、吉敦一次、中東二次）、每次均毁列車若干、斃日軍官兵數名、以陳崇僅在吉林東北部工作成績爲最佳、現尙佔據饒河·寳清·虎林·勃利·富錦·等縣、次則以宋國榮部在吉海路沿線羅明星部在吉長沿線出没攻擊、均與日軍一偉大擾亂、其他各小部份、均有相當之成績、</p>

<h3 id="c241">農民的娱樂 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>故鄕人來，談起農村的近况，先是一聲長歎，接着滿口牢騷。據說連可以尋些快樂的事情也没有了。</p>
<p>前幾年，遇到收成較好，演幾塲戲，賽一次會，用來舒舒精神，也還常有的。而且每次總是人山人海，爭著看熱鬧；似乎用自已的汗衆，來悅自已的耳目，比較更爲有味。</p>
<p>然而農民的汗血，畢竟是不應該耗費在自已身上的。</p>
<p>賽會和演戲，終於也有人來干涉了。干涉的原因，在先聽說是要破除迷信。但每次會塲或戲場上，比菁蕯更多的是人，比菩蕯更懂快樂的也是人，大槪到了干涉者的眼裏，這些人都變了菩蕯，所以演戲賽會結他們看是近乎迷信，非加以阻遏不可罷！</p>
<p>晚近憑空來了個國難，原因也就隨着改變了。除了可以救國的跳舞外，苟屬婉樂，都該廢止。然而這都該二字，到如今業已證明，是只對鄕僻農村面言的。</p>
<p>從前吾鄕，還有舉行龍燈會一類的勾當，一來是點綴昇平，二來是表示「與民同樂」。現在却因爲國難方殷，大人先生們憂心未已，雖是鄕僻的農民，也得哭喪着臉了。</p>
<p>但不久以前據說又可以通融了，這大槪是官辦或商辦的。名目是宣傳什麽救國，門票小洋二角，而所演的戲呢，則大都是刁劉氏殺子報之類。</p>
<p>可是生意却並不怎樣興隆。</p>
<p>被干涉之後，接着又要門票小洋二角，農民寂寞的心裏，再不會想到娱樂了。</p>
<h3 id="c242">小說評點家李卓吾 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>古代白話小說，自唐五代變文，宋元平話，大都出於市井里巷說書人之手，似乎當時那些自命博雅的文人都不曾理會到這些。直到明代，纔有許多有名的文人注意到小說，或創作，或　定，或評點。例如短篇平話，「三言」「兩拍」是馮夢龍凌濛初編定的，或許還有他們的創作在内。章回小說，水滸三國相傳是施耐菴羅貫中所作，他們都是元　之際的人。西遊記出於吴承恩，金瓶梅疑爲王世貞手筆。至於小說評點家，最著名的前目李卓吾鍾伯敬，後有金聖歎。周作人先生講述「新文學的源流」，關於鍾伯敬有很明白扼要的介紹。金聖歎則因他　評點的三國演義極爲流行，差不多婦孺　知了。現在我要來談談李卓吾。</p>
<p>稱爲李卓吾評點的小說最多，有水滸三國西遊記，及空空幻，龍圖公案，繡榻野史等書。還有七十二朝四書人物演義，也題「李卓吾先生秘本」。他何以特别歡喜小說呢？說起他來，眞是一個怪人。他中過舉，做過校官和知府等官。他本是泉州晋江人，因與黄安耿子庸友善，罷官後，就寄居黄安。不久，他又移居麻城龍潭湖上，讀書講學。一日，頭癢，他便薙髮爲僧。他說法娓娓不倦，女人也來聽法。或說：「女人見短，不短學進。」他說：「謂人有男女則可，謂見有男女豈可乎？謂見有長短則可，謂男子之見盡長，女人之見盡短可乎？且彼爲法來者，男子不如也。」原來卓吾丰骨孤峻，聰明蓋代，快談雄辯，駭俗驚人。論學宗旨，出入儒佛之間。痛恨腐儒爲君子，往往詆毁孔丘。他說：一天生一人自有一人之用，不待取給於孔子而後足也。若必待取足於孔了，則千古以前無孔子，終不得爲人乎？」他以爲漢唐宋千百餘年來無是非，「咸以孔子之是非爲是非，故未嘗有是非。」他旣不肯學孔子，又反以孔子之是非爲是非，自然要遭當日那些八股文人，講學腐儒的痛恨。他是當時思　界一顆光燄萬丈的彗星，王充以來，一人而已。焦竑和卓吾同時，是一個讀書極博的學者，瞧不起人，獨推崇卓吾。他說：</p>
<p>卓吾高邁肅潔，如泰華崇嚴，不可呢近。聽其言，冷冷然，塵土俱盡。衆人之疑，不勝賢豪者之信：疑者之恍惚，不勝信者之堅决。雖未必是聖人，可肩一狂字，坐聖人第二席。</p>
<p>卓吾所著書，一焚於萬歷三十年，爲張問達所奏請。再焚於天啓五年，爲御史王雅量所奏請。只有稱爲他所評點的許多小說，幸免於這種暴力。他因被張問達目爲「妖人，」奏劾下獄，自割而死。我們不要忘記他是一個反孔子反傳統思想的怪傑，他纔不受傳統文學的束縛，肯用心力於評點小說。然是人家評點小說要託名於他，也不是無故而然的。周亮工因樹書屋書影，說有「葉文通，名畫，無錫人。多讀書，有才情，留心二氏學，故爲詭異之行。……當温陵（卓吾）焚藏書盛行時，坊間種種借温陵之名以行者，如四書第一評，第二評，水滸傳，琵琶，拜月諸評，皆出文通手。」大約稱爲李卓吾評點的小說，有卓吾自已的，也有葉文通僞託的罷。</p>

<p>— 施蟄存</p>
<p>我明明記得，「顏氏」家訓中的確有一個故事，說有人敎子弟學鮮卑語，學琵琶，但我還記得底下有一句：「亦不願汝曹爲之」，可見　之推並不勸子弟讀外國書。今天豐先生有一正誤了，他把這故事更正了之後，却說：「施蟄存先生却是合　十與顏氏的兩種典型爲一體的。」這個，我倒不懂了，難道我另外還介紹過一本該「　士」的著作給青年人嗎？如果豐先生這　　是根據於「自已讀外國書卽助人學鮮卑　」，那我也没話可說了。</p>
<p>先生似乎是　想爲儒家爭正統的人物，不然何以對於顏之推受佛敎影響如此之鄒　呢！何以對於我自已看一本釋　傳如此之不滿呢！這裏，有兩點可以題出來：（一）「顏氏家訓」一書之價値是否因「歸心　」而完全可以　殺？况且顏氏雖然爲佛敎張目，但他倒並不鼓吹出世，逃避　實，他也不過列　佛家與　家有可以並行不悖之點，而採佛家報應之說，以補儒家道德敎訓之不足，這也可以說等於現在人引「聖經」或「可蘭　」中的話一樣。（二）我看一本佛本行經，其意義也等於看一本「謨罕默德傳」或「基督傳」，旣無皈佛之心，更無勸人學佛之行，而豐先生的文章却說是我的「渡世法」，妙哉言乎，我不免取案頭的一本某先生捨金上梓的「百　經」而引爲同志矣。</p>
<p>我以前對於豐先生，雖然文字上有點大同　氣，但的確還是表示尊敬的，但看到「撲空」這一篇，他竞駡我爲「　塲惡少」了，切齒之聲，優若可聞，我雖「惡」，却也不敢再惡到以相當的惡　相報了。我呢，奮一句現成　：「十年一　文壇多，贏得洋塲惡少名」，原是無足重　，但對於豐先生，我想該是會得後悔的。今天　到「撲空正誤」，則又覺得豐先生所謂「無端的經　，自已的猜測，撤　，該　，」又正好　着給自已「寫　」了。</p>
<p>（附註）大晚報上那兩個標　並不是我自已加的，我並無「立場」，也並不顧意因我之故而使「莊子」與「文選」這兩部書爭吵起來。</p>

<p>二十七日自由談上載有署名「菊生」的一文，據說「雅片戰爭」乃村山知義之作，而非江口渙之作，所以我（高明）犯了一個錯誤云云：這眞把我弄得莫明其妙了。據我所知，（雅片戰爭」確係江口渙氏原作，村山知義最多不過是一個改作者而已，「最初的歐羅巴之旗」的中文譯本，我没有「領敎」過：倘若譯者在那上面没有說明這齣東西是江口渙原作，那不過表示譯者的寡聞而已。</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>筆爾問道：</p>
<p>「然則你從前和他非常相熟嗎，和這瑪賴沙？」</p>
<p>父親回答：</p>
<p>「自然啦，他每晚到我們家裏來頑的；但你總還記得每逢休暇日，他到學校來接你，並且吃過晚飯後他常常再把你送回學校去的。啊，不錯，哲安生出來的那早上，還是他去找的醫生呢！當你母親覺得痛楚時，他恰在我們家裏吃飯。我們卽刻知道你母親快要臨盆了，他便飛奔去找醫生。他忽忙間竟把我的帽子當作他的載去了。因爲我們後來常是爲着這事笑痛肚子，所以我至今還記得。也許他臨死的時候還想起了這些瑣碎事情呢：他旣没有任何繼承人，他便想：「啊，我對於這小子的出生是盡得有力的，我要把我的財物留給他。」</p>
<p>羅蘭夫人坐在一把靠背椅上，好像已沉浸在往事的回憶裏。她喃喃地像在告白她的心事似的：</p>
<p>「啊！這是一個正直的朋友，一個非常熟沈的，非常忠實的朋友，一個現在這時代難得過見的人。」</p>
<p>哲安站起身說：</p>
<p>「我出去散一散步。」</p>
<p>他父親吃了一驚，想要留住他，因爲他們有話要說，他們娶計劃一些事情，决定一些事情。但這少年藉口有一個約會，一定要出去。並且他們在掌有那遺産之前，也儘還有着充分的時間來商量呢。</p>
<p>於是他出去了，因爲他想要離開一切人，獨自考慮一下。隨後筆爾也說要出去，幾分鐘後，跟在他兄弟後面走了。</p>
<p>等到祇剩下羅蘭老爹和他的女人在一塊時，他便把她抱在懷裏，在她每邊頰上吻了十下，爲着報復她常常給他的一個責備，他對她說道：</p>
<p>「你看，親愛的，我們那時不再留在巴黎給孩子們作馬牛，搬來逼喪恢復我的健康，這事是毫没有什麽損失的，因爲財真是從天下掉給我們了。」</p>
<p>她現得很嚴肅的樣子說：</p>
<p>「這財真是從天上掉給哲安的，可是筆爾呢？」</p>
<p>「筆爾！但他是醫生，他可以自已賺到……賺到一些錢，並且他的弟弟也定會帮助他一點。」</p>
<p>「不，他不會受的。而且這筆遺産是給哲安的，祇給哲安一人的。這樣，筆爾便遠不及他兄弟富有了。」</p>
<p>這老實人好像感着困難似的：</p>
<p>「那麽我們將來在遺囑上多留給他一點好了。」</p>
<p>「不。這也不是很公平的辦法。」</p>
<p>他呌說道：</p>
<p>「啊！那便怎麽辦呢，嚇！這事你要我有甚麽辦法呢？你老是尋覓種種使人不快的念頭。你樣樣都要使我掃興的。啊，我去睡覺了。晚安。無論如何，這總是一個好運道，一個頂頂好的運道！</p>
<p>於是他甚麽都不管，快快樂樂的跑去睡覺去了，對於那位那樣慷慨死去的朋友，一句婉惜的話都没有。</p>
<p>羅蘭太太又對着燒焦了的洋燈開始凝思。</p>

<p>佛家戒殺，據說是爲了不忍把牲畜的生命，來供自已的　餮，推已而及於牲畜，雖然對於同樣地有「生命」的植物，毫不憐憫地烹食，但是五十步與百步，我們自然不得崇拜僅逃了五十步者的精神之偉大。所以佛家戒殺，雖然不及於同樣地有生命的植物，但是我們不得不崇拜佛家不食動物之肉的精神，終究勝於并此而不能的「弱肉强食論」者。</p>
<p>中國文化的中心，就不外乎「婆心」。雖然儒釋道三分鼎足，但是都丢不掉「惻隱之心」。掉一句文，或許就可以說是「王道」。這自然是「禮讓之邦一應有的「大國丰度」，而且這也是中國民族不致被異族消滅的一種强有力的素因。五胡亂華，匈奴，韃靼，人主中華，到頭來仍舊不得不歸政於我炎黄後裔，這便是一個很好的例證。而且凡是人主中華，奴視我炎黄後裔的，到頭來終於逃不出爲中華民族所同化，而應了佛家的「因果論一，因爲存心要奴使而滅亡别一個民族的，便是逆天行道，已種下了「惡因」，才生成被同化的「惡果」。所以印度朝鮮，雖已亡國，若是這個世界的末日不就來臨的話，凖有一天會恢復山河的。</p>
<p>天大的事情，都委之於天也」，不只是人生哲學最重要的一頁，簡直是政治哲學的精華。拿破崙，路易十三，威廉第二，喑嗚叱咤，顯然地没曾研究過「不生不滅」，「與世無爭」的大道理。近世的墨索利尼，希脫勒，斯丹林，荒木之輩，怎一個懂得「報應循環」，「天理昭彰」。惟有不存「擴展領土野心」，「得失無所榮心」的，雖然吃些「眼前虧」不怕不安坐而收「來生債」。</p>
<p>半部論語，可以治天下，這個「天下」，還不遇是四海之内的「天下」。惟有半部佛經，才可以平定超利四海的「天下」，而化干戈爲帛。所以不只吴玉帥，孫　帥，放下屠刀，讀經皈佛，就是歐美名流，也紛紛渡海來華，上寳華山受戒有爲佛門弟子。着罷，平將來之天下者，非半部佛經莫屬。</p>

<p>上海市爲引起民衆服用國貨起見，把今年稱做「國貨年」；同時ＸＸ省有勦滅不清的匪共，爲害閭里，那一省的軍民也上下一心，把今年稱做「勦匪年」，以示與匪誓不共存的大决心！可是匪勢依然猖獗，民衆依然痛苦：昨天碰到一位ＸＸ省的友人，由他帶來很多關於ＸＸ省的消息，現在把他說給我聽的擇要記下來，代表匪區農民的呻吟吧。</p>
<p>秋收無望的田間、始終呈着慘淡枯黄的苦臉，鄕人們並不像往年秋天的忙碌，只閑盪盪地這裏看看那裏看看，或者回到四壁蕭然空無所有的所謂「屋」的東西裏去站站；孩子們憔悴着臉兒向爸爸說！「餓呀！」向媽媽說；「冷呀！」可是他們爸爸媽媽除嘆息聲外，更没有像以前那樣興奮的說；田裏的黄金，就是我們的衣服啊；就是我們的白飯啊；田裏没有收穫，什麽「救國捐」啦，「勦匪軍事捐」啦，這些好聽的名目，又是農民應盡的義務。</p>
<p>安守本分的農民呢，除了閉着眼睛坐在「屋」裏活活的餓死，是没有旁地邪念的；有時也見到什麽救濟委員會委員們，伸頭從汽車的窗口張張外面，也曾用吃過五十元一餐魚翅席的尊口，吸過一元一枝雪茄烟的尊唇說：「救災呀」！「救災囑」！可是雪茄烟的青烟一縷一縷噴出的時候，那救災呀！救災呀！的餘音，也就隨之而盡；强項的農民，惑於「不甘餓死」的英名，便鋌而走險，加入匪的戰團，雖然知道這玩意兒不要要，但是爲了生活，就顧不到這許多了。</p>
<p>匪區農民都抛了那一物所無的故鄕，去度妻逃子散顚沛流離的生活，妻風冷露，慘月高照，寂寞的鄕村，除了失掉主人豢養的幾只鷄犬鳴吠而外，便没有半點兒聲息，田裏的枯禾，在這月光之下，現着分外的憔悴，秋蟲喞喞，更没有人來賞聆它的妙奏，也没有人來再作第二篇「秋聲賦」了。</p>

<p>能屈能伸，方不失爲一個大丈夫，古之人都是這樣說。本來一個人必須耳聽八面，眼觀四方：就使有人欺負了你，也須先看看對方是何等樣人。倘是瘦得像乾麵條一般的人，那你就可以老實不客氣，飽以老拳，出出這口烏氣：倘不幸遇着一個機警鬼，那你須要見機而作，因爲你一卤莽，少不得又要吃虧。</p>
<p>只屈不伸，那種人便是没有出息：只伸不屈，那種人也是匹夫之勇。没有出息，便只有做奴隸的資格；匹夫之勇，也没有好結果的。然而節節退讓，致罹亡身之禍，那倒不如只伸不屈的好！爭奈國人見不及此，猶斷斷然以能見機而作自居，夫復何言！夫復何言！</p>

<p>在農村裏，我踏着細匀，鬆軟的鄕土，靜穆，温馨是這兒的特色，無限的瑩潔的長空下，雲是那樣舒散地飛着，掠過眉黛般的遠山，掠過紅色的叢林，掠過掛着小白旗的漁舟的桅梢…………………</p>
<p>黄色的小野菊點綴在道旁靜寂的墳頭，銀色的小乳羊，散放在遼闊的荒園裏，樣兒都像這樣閑散，老黄牛臥在草堆裏，口腔常常是磨動着，那蠢物偶而一聲長嗚，便把那些在田這裏找稻粒的小麻雀驚嚇得一齊飛上樹梢……</p>
<p>天眞嬌憨的村童三三兩兩地散立在籬邊，唱出他們純熟的土曲，又是那末動人！城市裏的人每次經過，他們都要投一次驚奇的目光，……「看喲！又是穿長衫的人來了！」是他們呼喊！</p>
<p>田道裏的黄金色稻草堆已經疊得狠高了，誠樸的老農在努力工作裏，猛抽着他們的旱烟，枯竭的笑聲，有時也從他們那裏發出來，他們以勞力來換取收獲，是他們愉快的唯一的來源……</p>
<p>低矮的茅草屋嵌在天地相接處，隱隱約約的炊烟傢倒立在屋子上一般，久而不散……白色小旗伸出樹梢外面飄拂着，是農村裏酒店和茶園的標幟……景色都像那樣淡雅宜人，是靜穆的美；是東方的韻味，是王維詩裏面的畫……</p>

<p>第十八回　脈腋傳茶含悲慰夫壻怱怱出塞强笑别家人</p>
<p>有人說，愛國是一種迷信，只要把愛國這種思想，灌輸到人民的腦筋裏面去了，那個人爲了愛國，就可以把生命財産，完全犧牲。若是世界上的人，都没有了這種愛國思想，就没有了軍事戰爭，也没有經濟戰爭人就要安樂得多了。其實愛國這種迷信，正也不容易讓人傳染。就像趙翁，他平常是很鼓吹愛國思想的。可是到了他的兒子，要帶兵上前線替國家打仗了，他的心裏就會感到二十四分的不安，覺得砲火是無情的東西，兒子當的是連長，這是像弟兄們一樣的要上前線，而且不能有安全地帶可以掘護自已的。所以他心裏儘管是難受，可是他的口裏，依然還在那裏鼓勵着他的兒子，一定要爲國家出力。及至聽清楚了兒子是到喜峯口去堵口子的，那就離着日本軍隊遠了，所以突然的精神震奮起來，就向外院子裏連連喊着楊老太太。江氏忽然聽到趙翁這樣的大呌，心裏頭也有些莫明其妙，立刻就口裏答應着，兩條腿便已跟着走到了後院子裏來。趙翁等他一進門，兩手就一拍道：現在我明白了，咱們可不必那樣多掛心，自强他不是出山海關去，就是到喜峯口爲止啦。這地方離着打仗的地方，那就遠着啦。老實說一句，在那裏駐防，也就像在西苑大營差不多，一點没有關係。（二二八）</p>

<h3 id="c277">哭和笑 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 咏</p>
<p>「哭」，「笑」，這是人的本能作用，小孩兒從娘肚出世就破天荒呱地一聲，過了一些時候，在一種温柔撫慰之下，又破開小嘴微微地笑起來了。這是很自然的事，似乎說來也未免有淺薄之誚。然而，若把這「哭」，「笑」，擴大地說，由小孩到成人，由成人到老人；由個人到社會，由社會到人類全體；那就在這哭笑之間的行程中，潛留着不知若干的人類悲觀離合，酸甜苦辣的喜事慘事。　　不管是哭，是笑，哭笑都有着一個動人的誘力。碰着一個小孩笑着臉迎面而來，就覺得這小孩可愛，碰着一個女人笑媚着自已，就心靈浮動，感到一種不可名言的愉快。同樣，看到一個小孩哭喪着臉，就有不忍之心油然而生，看到一個女人泣不成聲，也不免有由憐而愛之感。</p>
<p>許多文人都喜觀笑，喜觀哭，都讚美「哭」「笑」是一種美麗的表現，至高的藝術。的確，世界再没有比「哭」「笑」之感人更深更切的了。中國的詩人騷客有一句「一哭見眞情」的嘆語，日本文豪廚川白村在苦悶的象黴一書中，也歌頌着笑是人類的詩歌，人類的藝術，蘇聯這個别有意味的國度也由政府懸牌鼓勵國民的笑，幽默文豪蕭伯訥的一見哈哈笑，於今也到處流行起來。</p>
<p>哭有人讚嘆，笑更有人正式提倡了，然而生在今日這荒凉悽慘的世界，生死决鬥的戰塲上，有枯骨，有殘骸，有「一將功成萬骨枯」的笑，有一猶是春閨夢裏人」的哭。</p>
<p>然而，再看這破滅的憂鬰的中華呵，災禍横流，荒村野店，都變成一身無恨的焦士，賣妻鬻子，甚到易子而食，這還有什麽歡欣可笑，更有甚麽心事可、</p>
<p>哭，還有什麽情愛，這簡直不是人間，不僅没有人的笑，而且簡直没有哭的人了。</p>
<p>幽默家儘管一見哈哈笑，但跑到那荒村野店裏，那些扳着猙鑏的餓相，有誰和你笑？讚嘆「一哭見眞情」的詩人騷客們，也没有那種如怨如訴的哀哭讚嘆了，……哭倒在權門之下，得不到一粒果腹之物，而且在那副猙獰的餓相上，也流不下眼淚來。</p>
<p>這破滅的憂鬰的中華，是這樣一個可怕的慘象，没有情，敢没有愛，只有爭奪，只有殘酷的剝削。</p>
<p>也許有人跳出了這慘象的圈外，在哭着，在笑着，這圈外的哭笑，是没有眞實的意味，是虚浮的幻影，空洞的人生之反映，而且根本的說，是没有情，也没有愛的。</p>
<p>被導爲人類的詩歌，人類的藝術的哭和笑，要在這黑漆一團的人羣底生活基底上提拔出來，恢復社會的和平，情，愛，纔可以出現。</p>

<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>今天偶然在書架上抽下一本柴霍甫小說集，在書中發現了一絲退了色的菊花辦。於是，往事又被憶起了。</p>
<p>去年，也是這時節的一個下午。我約了華到兆豐花園去作一度秋色的鑒賞。我穿了一件半新的夾衫，華在她的綠色的旗袍外加了一件短短的藍色的絨線</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>衫。我們帶了　本小說去，想在公園裏把這一個下午在秋的景象下消磨掉。</p>
<p>到了公園，牠給我們的是一個有特異興味的景色。風帶了落葉跳舞：一個月以前還枝葉茂盛的樹木都像老年人一樣漸漸地變成秃頂。祇有尖頂的常綠樹給我們一個興奮的精神的模範。</p>
<p>華是愛花的，她喜歡坐在花的下面讓花擁抱着她。以前，我對於花是提不起興味來的後來受了她的影響，我也愛起花來了。爲了倆人都愛花，所以我們毫不留戀的别了尖頂的常綠樹四處尋覓花叢。</p>
<p>秋天雖然和春天一樣的是一個温和的季節，但是，秋天的花是比不過春天的。在春天，無論何處都可以找到花，然而秋天找花却是一件很困難的事。我們化了不少的工夫找，終於在一個角隅像哥倫布發現新大陸一樣地找到了一叢開放已足的菊花，顏色是粉紅色的，稍微帶些黄色。</p>
<p>於是我們很快樂地互相看了一眼，大家含着滿足的微笑，於是我們把手帕舖在地上，並排地坐了下來。</p>
<p>華輕輕地攀了一枝菊花放在鼻上嗅着，把花輕輕地放在蘋果色的頰上。我對着花出神。</p>
<p>「可愛的菊花啊！」華柔聲地說。</p>
<p>「菊花並不可愛！」我裝着一付正經面孔說。</p>
<p>「爲什麽？」華帶着一些些嗔怪的口吻：「很可愛的」！</p>
<p>「因爲有比菊花更可愛的在啊」！我笑了。</p>
<p>起頭，華故意尖着嘴唇，裝着生氣的樣子。後來，她也笑了。她鬆了手，菊花又挺直了，抖下了一些謝了的花瓣，掉在我們的頭髮上，衣服上。</p>
<p>華拾起了一叢花瓣，握在掌心裏搖擺着，像一位慈母撫摸她的愛兒一樣。</p>
<p>「菊花始終是可愛的啊！他是何等的勇敢，在這箱露之下雄糾糾地怒放着！」華挺着胸說。</p>
<p>我點點頭。又笑着說：「你倒有些男子的氣槪哩！」</p>
<p>我們就這樣的消磨了一個下午；在笑聲裏，在花香中。</p>
<p>將歸時，我們拾起了幾條花瓣，夾進書中。我們希望菊花的芬芳永久存在着。</p>
<p>如今這一瓣菊花又媉在我的手中了，菊花的芬芳還有一部分保存着，然而「比菊花更可愛的」又在何處！</p>
<p>菊花啊，我希望你永遠將你的芬芳存留着！菊花啊，我希望你永遠是那樣的純潔的可愛的！我願意你常常給我一個甜蜜的回憶！可是，我不希望你是一個有知者，象徵着我們的隔離！</p>

<p>— 愼敏</p>
<p>在交際塲中混？和商界中應酬，對於面部的表情，有密切的關係，而且要合於藝術化，其態度要活潑而恭敬，恭敬之中，還要謙和，謙和之中，又要莊嚴，莊嚴之中更須要帶一些滑稽，滑稽之中尤宜帶一些實際，而目還要帶着一些笑容，笑容之中，更宜鄭重，面部的表情，眞是難乎其難了。如果你恭敬的程度過了分，有人要疑惑你别有用意，一起了疑惑，無論何事，不能信任你了，種種事情，就此弄僵，所以恭敬之中，又要謙虚而和藹，如果太謙和了，有人要當你好户頭，同時當你大菜盆子看待，往往有不利於你的事情發生，所以謙和之中，又要莊嚴，因爲身分和架子，全在這莊嚴裏頭表現出來的，但是太莊嚴了，有人要說你道學先生，迂腐，固執，那就令人見之而生畏了，所　莊嚴之中，還須帶着一些滑稽，但是滑稽要滑的得當，全本浮滑而無稽，則又不成事體，所以還要帶些實際。總而言之，在這世態炎炎凉，人情澆薄的社會上混混，非有莊諧圓滑，巧言令色的態度，斷斷不能得到最後勝利。</p>
<p>俗語有句話，呌做「老實頭」，一個頭只要老實，任憑你怎樣疙𤺥的心腸，潑辣的手段，只要神通廣大，八面週到，運用得當，就可萬事亨通得心應手。有了這樣的本領，就可算是眞心的一個文武全材的一等拿麽温的交際大家了。</p>
<p>至於一般最高級身份的大人先生們，其面部的表現，另有一番景象；他們現出一副聲色俱厲的神氣，搭出一副威風凛凛的架子，一朝權在手，那怕不低頭，竟有非此不足以表示大亨身分之槪。</p>
<p>這也難怪他們，只因我國的獨裁制的劣根性太深，那裏談得到化除階級觀念，更談不到平等二個字哪。</p>
<h3 id="c280">關於日米 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>最近因爲上海的八家米行，冒了外商牌號，私進了大批日米，這件事情又突然的閙大了。</p>
<p>中國是一個農業國，地大物博，索以生産大批農業品見稱於世界，在理别的工業品，因爲科學的落後而要入超，米麥却總可出超了，那知事實却不然，根據近年來海關的報告，米和麥每年也要入超不少，這眞是使人「百思而莫解」呢！</p>
<p>自已的米，旣不足供給本國人民所需，在理求過於供，米價一定會高貴，但近來偏是米價低廉，到處鬧着「榖賤傷農一的恐慌，更是「令人莫解」！</p>
<p>日本幅圓狹小，農産不多，一般的農民，也都在鬧饑荒，没有飯吃，可是這一次日本偏有這大量的米運到中國來銷售，難道他們寗可餓死本國人民，米糧却不可不向國外運去麽？又是一個「令人莫解」！</p>
<p>總之，現時代的世界之中，一切的一切，也許却是那些「令人莫解」的事情吧？九一八，一二八，兩次的砲彈，不現化名人書畫孔白雲先生山水孔懷字雲白會稽人能詩善畫尤工金石</p>
<p>知炸死了多少中國人，但被難的血跡未乾，而未難的却又甘心和仇人作賣買，訂講大批的洋米了。</p>
<p>「人心已死」！「熱度五分」！已被外國人看煞了，所以儘可把飛機大砲向中國轟，轟過了中國人就會忘記，飛機在頭頂上，心理想着從此不能再買ＸＸ貨，但飛機一過，又忘記了，祇要賺錢，什麽賣買都可做。</p>
<p>「農村破産」！「榖賤傷農」！的聲浪已波動了整個的中國，但上海的米商，惟恐米價還太貴，農民還没餓死，所以把大批的日米運來，使米價繼續下跌。</p>
<p>在中國的四萬萬同胞中，農民佔居了多數，現在米價是如此低廉，農村是十九破産了，全中國的人民，可算十九陷在萬難之中。</p>
<p>要維持農村的不破産，唯一的方法，祗有使米價高漲，達於相當的限度，但而今祇顧私利的米商，竟不顧農民的生活，儘量的推銷日米，使中國米再趨低落，豈不是在求中國三萬萬以上的農民，陷於絶境嗎？</p>

<p>Guihua: Li Songfeng and his party of 30 left Guihua by car at 4 a.m. on the 31st for Bailing Temple. Wu Heling, Yimeng A Wang went with them and may arrive in the evening. They are scheduled to return to Suiyuan within the week. Huang and Zhao will depart after Li and others return. Xu Tingyao arrived in Suiyuan from Beiping on the morning of the 31st. After getting off the train, he immediately went to the headquarters to visit Huang. (Special Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Guihua: After Huang Shaoxiong arrived in Suiyuan, he has already discussed the Inner Mongolia issue with Fu Zuoyi, and their opinions are harmonious. He has also spoken separately with the Mongolian princes and representatives of the Mongolian people in Suiyuan. He has a better understanding of the Mongolian people's demands for autonomy and believes it will be beneficial to resolving the issue. Huang said that he has dispatched Li Songfeng, Kong Xianzong, Chi Zhongkuan, He Yangling, Ruan Yumin, E Qiguang, and others, ten people in total, to depart on the morning of the 31st to inspect and negotiate in Bailing Temple. He and Zhao will follow later. There will be no long delay in Suiyuan Province. In the afternoon of the 30th, Yimeng A Wang hosted a banquet for Huang, Zhao, Fu, and others at his residence. (Special Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy, after Huang Shaoxiong and Zhao Pilian arrived in Suiyuan and discussed it with Fu Zuoyi and representatives of the Mongolian people, a general decision has been reached. The authorities' intention regarding Mongolian affairs is to support its success under the principles stipulated by the central government, without disrupting the system or the entire organization. Otherwise, they are prepared to take appropriate and effective legal measures to prevent it. The Mongolian people are determined to make autonomy successful and demand that all of Suiyuan north of Zhangjiakou be within the geographical scope of their autonomy. Therefore, how the Inner Mongolia issue will unfold is worthy of attention, and one cannot be overly optimistic. Xu Tingyao accompanied Huang Fu to Mongolia at his invitation to inspect everything. (Special Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Suiyuan telegram: Wu Heling and others arrived in Suiyuan on the 28th, and the Yun League leader sent a car to pick them up. On the 31st, together with representatives from Beijing and Beiping, the deputy leader of Yimeng A League, and more than 30 of Huang's staff, they went to Bailing Temple. Huang will stay in Suiyuan for a few days before going there. (Special Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The measures for Inner Mongolian autonomy will be decided after Huang and Zhao arrive in Bailing Temple. The so-called autonomy regulations are written by Prince De alone. (Special Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Shaoxiong telegraphed Beiping after arriving in Suiyuan, stating that he plans to convene a meeting in Suiyuan on November 3rd with authorities from Chahar and Suiyuan provinces and representatives of the Mongolian banners to exchange opinions on Inner Mongolian autonomy and discuss the issue of the autonomous region. Huang also telegraphed Song, hoping that Song Zheyuan and Qin Dechun would participate. Qin is scheduled to go to Suiyuan tomorrow afternoon to meet with Huang. (Special Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Guihua: Huang Shaoxiong said that this trip is to inspect Chahar and Suiyuan in accordance with orders and to report truthfully to provide the central government with a basis for reforming Mongolian administration. The rumors that he will go to Bailing Temple to attend a meeting are not true. When the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy first arose, various places were unclear about the truth and falsehoods, and discussions were excessively publicized. The Mongolian people of Chahar and Suiyuan number less than 300,000, an amount equal to a small county in the interior. Because they are located on the border and it happened during a serious national crisis, and also contains the meaning of nationality, it feels serious, and the central government is also paying close attention. Reports about the Bailing Temple meeting described the situation of organizing an autonomous government and breaking away from the central government trend. When I passed through Chahar to Suiyuan from Beiping, and talked with the League Flag representatives and princes, I knew that the purpose of their meeting was just to gather ideas and contribute the opinions of the Mongolian people for reference by the central government. The authority to take action still lies with the central government, and there is no extremely demanding autonomy. The central government previously discussed a plan to reform Mongolian administration, in which the reform of the local administrative system of Mongolia would not destroy the past administrative system as the principle, and the establishment of provincial governance and county governance landlords. The administrative area should not be changed. In places where Mongolian people live in groups, the provinces should separately set up local Mongolian Political Committees and Mongolian administration special management agencies, staffed by princes and young people with virtue and political knowledge and experience among the Mongolian people. The plan proposed by the central government is still a preliminary draft. Only after contacting the Chahar and Suiyuan provinces and the Mongolian banners can a proper method be decided. At the same time, it is necessary to discuss with the provincial government the practical problems of reforming Inner Mongolia, such as: (1) weighing the advantages and disadvantages of agriculture and animal husbandry, and respectively promoting them; (2) the division of territory and people; (3) relieving the people of double burdens; (4) improving local police organization; (5) improving tax and purchase system. The provincial government agrees with this very much. Before the actual problems of Mongolia are resolved, implementing autonomy is not what the central government considers. The central government will never make empty promises to deceive the Mongolian people and wants to make empty promises to allow the establishment of an autonomous government, and its legacy is really great. I came here to express the central government's true intentions towards the Mongolian people. After discussing with the provincial government, our opinions closely match. The scope of Mongolian autonomy will not, in principle, break away from the entire organization. The central government will help, otherwise, it will not be permitted by the central government. The relationship between the central government, the local government, and Mongolia is close and united, otherwise, it will not be the blessing of the country and the Mongolian people. If the Mongolian people try to coerce the country with the issue of autonomy, the country will definitely sanction it. (Special Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Prince De's representative, Bao Yueqing, came to Beiping to talk about the fact that the current Inner Mongolian demand for autonomy is divided into two principles: (1) The central government's immigration of Han Chinese and troops to the Mongolian land for reclamation makes it increasingly impossible for the Mongolian people to live and gain a foothold. (2) In accordance with Sun Yat-sen's teachings, they are determined to achieve their goal. Prince Yun is already 72 years old and supports autonomy. He is determined to imitate Xinjiang's Prince Mit and find a way out for the Mongolian people. He will not hesitate to sacrifice his life. Before the first meeting of the Bailing Temple Autonomous Preparatory Committee, the Panchen Lama tried hard to stop it and held two tea parties in Bailing Temple to convene the princes and general managers of various leagues and banners. He strongly advocated that they must submit a request to the central government for instructions and not go astray. Many young people in Inner Mongolia fiercely opposed the Panchen Lama. After explanations from Prince De and Prince Yun, they were pacified. All the princes and others believed that since the Yuan Dynasty, the administration and religion of Inner Mongolia had always been separated, and the Mongolian people's knowledge was gradually opening up. It was decided that the autonomous government would not mix politics and religion. I have already reported the details of the Bailing Temple meeting to Huang in Zhangjiakou. It is planned to include the entire Suiyuan in the autonomous region. Huang asked if there was room for compromise on the scope of the region. I replied that we need to wait for the congress to resolve it. Huang said that the central government has allowed Inner Mongolian autonomy, but the autonomous government cannot be established, because all provinces and counties in the interior have provincial and county governments. I am now visiting He Yingqin this afternoon and will stay in Beiping for five or six days before returning to Suiyuan to report. (Special Dispatch, 31st)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Military News: According to telegrams from representatives of Gansu and Qinghai provinces and the authorities of these provinces, the spokesman of the Military Sub-Committee stated that the opposition to Sun Dianying's troops heading west this time is not against Sun himself, nor is it against Sun's troops going to cultivate wasteland. In fact, it is because the number of troops is too large. Western Qinghai is barren and it is difficult to accommodate so many troops. The Military Sub-Committee stipulates that this unit should be seven infantry regiments and three cavalry regiments, and the total number should not exceed 20,000. Now, it is reported that Sun's unit has exceeded 50,000, which is far different from the quota stipulated by the Military Sub-Committee, causing panic among the people of Gansu and Qinghai. If Sun's troops can be reduced in accordance with the troop level approved by the Military Sub-Committee, the people and local authorities of the Northwest will not only not object, but will also welcome them wholeheartedly.

<p>(Nanjing) After Jin Shuren was arrested on the evening of the 30th, he was immediately held in the inspection office of the police department, where he received good treatment, but could not receive guests. On the morning of the 31st, the police department reported the process of arresting Jin to the Executive Yuan, and then received an order to escort Jin to the procuratorate of the Supreme Court for detention and interrogation on the same day. At 2:00 pm, the police department sent the inspection director Zhu Huaijiu, two inspectors, two policemen, and Section Chief Zhuang, who was sent by the procuratorate, to escort Jin in a police department car to the procuratorate of the Supreme Court in Sanpailou. After Chief Prosecutor Zheng briefly questioned him, because there were no spare rooms for detention, Zhu and Zhuang escorted Jin in a police car to the Nanjing Local Court in Xinlangjiang. After the prosecutor Sun Qian asked him a question, he approved the detention in the detention center. According to a certain authority of the procuratorate, this department will begin investigating after receiving instructions from the Ministry of Law and the external department sends the entire case of the treaty signed by Jin and Soviet Russia.

<p>(Nanjing) Former Xinjiang Chairman Jin Shuren was arrested on the evening of the 30th at the Central Hotel by police dispatched by the Capital Police Department. He is currently detained at the Supervisory Office and receiving preferential treatment, but is being prevented from communicating with the outside world. He was sent to the local court on the afternoon of the 31st. It is said that the reason for Jin's arrest is that when Jin was in charge of Xinjiang earlier this year, he signed the Soviet-Xinjiang Treaty with Russia. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believed that the treaty humiliated national sovereignty and specially submitted it to the Executive Yuan for investigation. This time, Jin came to Beijing from Jiangxi, and the Executive Yuan immediately ordered the police department to secretly monitor him. After the Executive Yuan meeting passed the impeachment case against Jin on the 30th, it ordered the police department to arrest him at 8:45 p.m. on the 30th. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Shi Zhiquan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter, Jin Shuren, the former Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, abused the people and harmed the administration for several years. He is suspected of committing serious criminal offenses. The Executive Yuan meeting decided on the 30th to punish him according to law, and first ordered the Capital Police Department to arrest him. The Ministry only received the order late at night and forwarded it to the Supreme Procuratorate for notification on the 31st. The impeachment procedures of the case could have been handled directly by the Procuratorate, but for the convenience of investigation, the Procuratorate will order the Jiangning Local Court Inspection Office to investigate nearby. As for the evidence in the case, it has not yet been transferred to the judicial organs, and the nature of the crime is still difficult to determine. Whether the court of first instance is the local court or the high court will depend on the local court's investigation. If the case is not under its jurisdiction, it will be submitted to the Jiangsu High Court Procuratorate for handling. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the government placed Jin Shuren under surveillance for impeachment according to law, Ma Zizhen, a member of the Military Council, told reporters that Jin was inherently cruel, deceived the central government, and harmed the local people. When he was in charge of Xinjiang, he caused public outrage and the first rebellion due to the massacre of a Hui prince in Hami. Jin also colluded with foreigners to sign treaties that were humiliating and detrimental to the country. An official from the province stationed in Beijing is also suspected of helping Jin deceive the central government and obstruct public opinion. It is hoped that the government will severely punish Jin and others to warn against official corruption and rectify discipline. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Jin Shuren was escorted to the Jiangning Local Court, he said to others that he came to Beijing from Nanchang via Xunyang. He visited Chiang in Nanchang to make a report. Chiang treated him very well and was exceptionally polite when he left, and sent someone to accompany him to Beijing. He did not expect to be arrested. He felt baffled by his arrest last night. Now that he has been arrested, he can only await legal resolution. Ai Sha and others, representatives of Xinjiang natives in Beijing, have decided to unite various religious groups and natives of Xinjiang in Beijing to petition the Central Party Headquarters and relevant ministries of the National Government, requesting that a special tribunal be set up to handle Jin Shuren's trial, and requesting that embezzled funds be strictly pursued to compensate the losses of the people of Xinjiang.

<p>(Nanjing) Li Zeyi, a senior advisor to the Ministry of the Navy, recently went to Japan. There is still much speculation about this.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not assign him any mission. As for what Li said in Japan, that if there is a new development in Sino-Japanese diplomacy, he would be very willing to discuss it with any party, this is because Li has considerable affection with Japanese government and the public. It should be regarded as Li's personal action, and the government does not bear any responsibility. (Special dispatch from the 31st)</p>

<h3 id="e30">Thoughts After Reading Mr. Kong's Remarks <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>In yesterday's remarks to the press, the newly appointed Minister of Finance, Mr. Kong Xiangxi, provided a very sincere analysis of the national financial plan. His statement about "nurturing the foundation and opening up new sources" was particularly pertinent. By "nurturing the foundation and opening up new sources," Mr. Kong meant "seeking sources that benefit the country and do no harm to the people. Only then can what is opened up be a sweet spring. Otherwise, disregarding everything and only seeking to increase revenue in the short term, without considering the people's ability to bear the burden and the impact they suffer, will inevitably lead to the people's livelihood becoming increasingly difficult, and the country will be further plunged into a predicament. Then what is opened up is a poisonous source or bitter water."</p>
<p>Mr. Kong's words are not only sufficient to diagnose the ills of China's current finances, but also conform to the principles of finance. After Mr. Kong takes office, how he intends to open up new sources to cultivate the people's vitality is currently unknown. However, judging from the facts of today, there are countless kinds of revenue sources that harm vitality. Taking the item of land tax mentioned in Mr. Kong's remarks as an example, it is already a very obvious tax with an imbalanced burden. The salt tax is also similar. The consumption of salt is the same regardless of wealth or poverty. For example, if a poor person eats half a he of salt a day, then a rich person will also eat half a he of salt a day, and sometimes even less than a poor person. Therefore, the payment of salt tax is equal for both rich and poor. In other words, if the salt tax paid by both rich and poor is compared with their property, the ratio of salt tax paid by the poor is many times greater than that of the rich. There are many such imbalanced taxes. Not to mention the various exorbitant taxes and levies inland that hinder the vitality of the people. Therefore, since Mr. Kong pays attention to the need to consider the people's vitality in new sources of revenue in the future, he should also pay attention to old sources of revenue that harm the people's vitality. This is the first reason why we have feelings.</p>
<p>Secondly, Mr. Kong also said in his remarks, "We must engage in cutting expenditures," and at the same time said, "Cutting expenditures must be carefully examined in light of the actual situation. All useless expenditures should be strongly blocked. Legitimate expenditures should not only not be reduced, but should be made more accessible." How wise these words are! However, when we look around at the central government's expenditures in the past two or three years, except for military expenses, which have had to increase year by year due to the urgent task of suppressing the communists, all other kinds of expenses have been drastically reduced. Judging from the financial situation in recent years, the reduction of administrative expenses is an unavoidable fact. However, in this inevitability, it seems that we cannot generalize. Construction and education are the great foundation of the country. No matter how severe the national crisis is, can construction and education be allowed to be abandoned? The importance of construction has already been discussed in Mr. Kong's remarks. As for education, precisely because the national crisis is becoming increasingly serious, it cannot be relaxed in the slightest. Education is the national talent construction institution. If we are frugal due to financial difficulties, then teachers will not be at ease in teaching, and students will not be at ease in learning. As a result, the people will become increasingly ignorant, and it will be difficult to hope for the alleviation of the national crisis. This is the second reason why we have feelings.</p>
<p>In summary, China's finances today have indeed reached a time of a hundred holes and thousands of sores. Mr. Kong has taken on great responsibility in this difficult situation. We sincerely hope that he can adhere to the declared policy to develop new plans in future politics.</p>
<h3 id="e31">The South Manchuria Railway Reform Plan Actually Contains Great Significance. The Kwantung Army Will Supervise All Railways in the Northeast <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) There are various opinions on the reorganization plan of the South Manchuria Railway Company. Among them, the intentions of the Army Central Department are as follows: The South Manchuria Railway reorganization issue has always been negotiated by the Kwantung Army Special Service Department and the South Manchuria Railway authorities. The content will separate the enterprises under the current management of the South Manchuria Railway or the newly established enterprises in the future, such as national defense industries, and hand over the command and supervision rights directly to the Kwantung Army. The railways entrusted to the "Manchukuo" for operation will also be commanded and supervised by the Kwantung Army. Regarding this matter, the Kwantung Army will not be subject to the control of the Minister of Colonial Affairs, but will be under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister or the Minister of the Army. The Army authorities' claims on the South Manchuria Railway reorganization issue are generally as above. It seems that no conflict of opinion has arisen between the Army and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs. (United Press dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The so-called South Manchuria Railway reorganization plan proposed by the Kwantung Army Special Service Department is still being negotiated by the South Manchuria Railway Company and the Kwantung Army. Because the supervisory agency of the South Manchuria Railway, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, did not receive a report on this matter from the military department, it invited Yuzaki, the director of the South Manchuria Railway, to the Ministry of Colonial Affairs on the 30th. Vice Ministers Yutei and Kawada and official Kimura listened to the contents of the reorganization plan in great detail. According to the South Manchuria Railway's opinion, the Kwantung Army's claims are too abstract and violate the essence of the South Manchuria Railway's business, so its proposed conditions cannot be implemented immediately. However, this issue has been formed into a central issue. After the South Manchuria Railway Vice President Hatta negotiates countermeasures with the South Manchuria Railway's senior management, he plans to urgently start negotiations with the Tokyo government authorities in Dalian in the near future.

<p>(Shenyang) Recently, about 700 members of the Big Sword Society, all armed with broadswords, attacked Dunhua City. After the soldiers and police defending the city resisted valiantly, a fierce battle lasting one hour, the members of the Big Sword Society began to retreat. When the attack occurred, the troops stationed in Dunhua City had been dispatched to Jilin. Upon hearing the news of the attack on Dunhua, they urgently retreated to counterattack. The members of the Big Sword Society were unable to withstand the attack and retreated. It is said that the Big Sword Society belongs to Wang Fengge's subordinates and is the strongest volunteer army in southwestern Shenyang. (Reuters dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Jilin) The Japanese army's units of Hirose and Takanori have now decided to carry out large-scale military operations to suppress the "bandits." 2,000 members of the Taiping Gu "bandits," who are the most powerful in the area along the Lafa-Harbin Railway, have now retreated to the Russian border. Another 2,000 bandits from Laoye Ridge have surrendered. The "bandit" atmosphere in the Jilin Plain has been cleared, but "bandit groups" still occupy the mountain areas. "Bandits" still go to villages to rob or kidnap people for ransom and seize weapons. The statistics of "bandit" cases in Liaoning Province from January to June this year are as follows: 719 people killed by "bandits," 635 injured, 3,441 kidnapped, 801 rifles seized, 4,827 rounds of ammunition, 2,112 horses. 2,963 "bandits" killed by the army, 749 injured, 685 captured, 1,521 firearms seized, 7,932 rounds of ammunition, 904 horses. The number of "bandit" cases each month is as follows: 306 in January, 516 in February, 343 in March, 299 in April, 651 in May, 466 in June, 589 in July, 940 in August, and 760 in September. Among them, the most occurred in the Dongbian area, but the Japanese army is currently engaged in suppression. (Reuters dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e35">Araki Talks About the Far East International Conference <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Government Does Not Attach Importance</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Araki returned to Tokyo from the site of the grand military exercise. According to his remarks in the car, regarding the East Asian Peace Conference that I talked about in Fukui, I have recently heard various rumors. Regarding this case, I have already lectured in various places, and I have also mentioned the same opinion at the Five-Minister Conference. The relevant cabinet members should know what my aspirations are. Although I advocate convening a conference, it cannot be realized immediately. There are also those among the Japanese people who are not clear-headed, who often say that today's Japan has already recognized "Manchukuo" in the past and then withdrawn from the League of Nations. The so-called international crisis is not serious. I believe that in order to open up the international situation, including the Manchuria issue, and establish international peace, it is necessary to open an East Asian Peace Conference between the related countries, and clearly present the path taken by Japan to the countries, so that the countries can understand Japan's true intentions. It is natural to make them recognize "Manchukuo" as the way to be taken. This opinion is what I hold. As for following this policy and making diplomatic preparations, there is still much to do. Some people say that viewing my ideas from the current international situation, there is no possibility of holding a meeting. No matter how the international situation is, it can be dealt with according to its current state. I feel that there is absolutely no impossibility. The so-called non-war treaty or concluding a non-aggression treaty with Soviet Russia, etc., are minor diplomatic issues and are not fundamental solutions. As for the negotiations between the Kwantung Army Special Service Department and the South Manchuria Railway authorities, they are now working hard to dredge this reform plan. Saying that it was not reported to the Ministry of Colonial Affairs and that the Kwantung Army disregarded the Ministry of Colonial Affairs is not true. Now we have not received any reports either. Regarding the reform plan, several plans may have been made by the relevant authorities, and it is not known whether any decisions have been made. However, I believe that the reform plan should be implemented with the great plan of the country for a hundred years as its purpose, and under this policy, the South Manchuria Railway business can be unified. (United Press dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Far East Peace Conference proposal advocated by Minister of the Army Araki, Prime Minister Saito has listened to the opinions of the Minister of the Army and only considers it an ideal proposal. Even within the government, the motivation and purpose of the Minister of the Army's proposal are unclear, and its realization still needs to be studied, so it is not given much importance and it is feared that it will be difficult to materialize.

<h3 id="e36">Hirota's Diplomacy Towards Russia Plans to First Break the Deadlock <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota's foreign policy has been roughly completed, and he plans to first break the deadlock between Japan and Russia and seek economic cooperation between the two countries. Foreign Minister Hirota held a discussion meeting on diplomacy towards Russia at the Foreign Minister's official residence at 6:00 p.m. today. Kurachi, Director of the Japan-Russia Association, Tanaka, former Ambassador to Russia, Kato, President of the Bank of Korea, Nakazato, Director of the North Sakhalin Oil Mine, and Kabayama, Chairman of the Japan-Russia Fisheries Association, all attended to discuss the policy towards Russia. After dinner, Foreign Minister Hirota reported on the contents of the Five-Minister Conference, saying that the government emphasized economic diplomacy. The attendees also expressed their opinions. It is said that the outline of the opinions expressed by the representatives of the financial community is as follows: (A) The fundamental policy of diplomacy towards Russia lies in the Japan-Russia Beijing Agreement, with the faithful implementation of the agreement by both sides as a prerequisite. (B) A non-aggression treaty is not necessary because the two countries already have the Beijing Agreement. However, because the situation in the Far East has undergone major changes and "Manchukuo" has become independent, the Russian side particularly hopes that Japan and Russia will sign a treaty, so the Japanese side must make the Russian side agree to the following conditions: (1) Stop its redification movement in the Far East, especially not to carry out redification movements against Japan and "Manchukuo." (2) Russia must withdraw its Far East military equipment, especially withdraw its military facilities from the "Manchukuo" territory and the troops dispatched during the September 18th Incident. (3) Abolish various laws in the Russian-owned enterprises in the Far East that oppress Japanese people, such as extending working hours, abolishing taxes on fishery supplies, fair treatment for North Pacific fisheries, exclusive Japanese handling of Russian-produced kerosene exported to Japan, and extending the period of oil mine exploration. (4) Open the Russian-owned Primorsky Krai, Kamchatka Peninsula, and North Sakhalin in the Far East, and implement a joint Japanese-Russian development policy, especially granting forestry and mining rights to Japanese people. (5) Promote Japanese-Russian trade, and the volume of imports and exports must be equal. (6) The Chinese Eastern Railway must be handed over to Japan as soon as possible. The opinions of the financial community regard the Russian territory in the Far East as the second pseudo-country, which is tantamount to opposing the signing of a non-aggression treaty between Japan and Russia. The meeting lasted about two hours and dispersed. (United Press dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Molidov, the Soviet Russian Trade Representative stationed in Harbin, visited Li Shaogeng, the puppet director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, yesterday, requesting joint transportation on the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway from Suifenhe to Vladivostok. Because the puppet side blocked the road, the Russian side suffered considerable losses in sending kerosene to Vladivostok. If the puppet side still does not change its attitude, Molidov said that he would return to his country and withdraw the Trade Department. His attitude was very tough. The traitor Li replied that when Russian oil is transported to Vladivostok, there will be no losses if it is transshipped in Khabarovsk. If Russia wants to continue joint transportation, it must return the locomotives and freight cars that have been detained; otherwise, it will not change its policy.

<h3 id="e39">Roosevelt's Policy of Purchasing Gold Abroad: A Prelude to Stabilizing Gold Prices? An Anglo-American Currency Truce? The Gold Dollar and Gold Pound Join Hands? Pittman Suggests to the President to Raise the Price of Silver <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, Federal Reserve Board Governor Black was suddenly summoned to participate in the Anglo-American war debt talks at the Treasury Department. It is rumored that the possibility of agreeing on an Anglo-American currency cooperation plan was discussed. Many believe that Mr. Black's participation in this two-hour conversation carries significant weight. (October 30, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. authorities are taking steps tonight to seek understanding from Britain on the gold issue. Mr. Rose, the British representative in the U.S. for war debt discussions, has suspended the war debt talks to consult with Undersecretary of the Treasury Acheson and Federal Reserve Board Director Black to explore the matter. At the same time, President Roosevelt's aides are preparing to purchase gold abroad no later than Wednesday. President Roosevelt met with the President of the New York Reserve Bank, Harrison, tonight. (October 30, Reuters)</p>
<p>(New York) The Chicago Tribune's Washington dispatch states that a secret agreement on a currency truce between Britain and the United States has now been reached. After several hours of consultation between British representative Rose and officials from the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury Department, the foundation for a trial method to fix the relative exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar has been agreed upon. This signifies a cessation of competition between Anglo-American currencies, allowing President Roosevelt to proceed with his gold purchase plan without disrupting British trade. (October 31, Reuters)</p>
<p>(New York) Senator Pittman today welcomed President Roosevelt's plan to buy gold, calling it a prelude to the permanent stabilization of gold prices and the limited restoration of the gold standard by various countries. Pittman stated that he had advised President Roosevelt to raise the price of silver in proportion to the increase in the price of gold. If President Roosevelt does not agree to this, he (Pittman) intends to introduce a bill in the next Congress to mandate the free coinage of silver by the United States at a ratio of sixteen to one. He expects this bill to pass by a majority. Government officials, described as conservatives, have stated to President Roosevelt that they are willing to remain silent, regardless of their opinions on the commercial dollar plan, to allow proponents of this plan the opportunity to prove their theory. If the experiment proves to be unworkable, President Roosevelt is prepared to use other methods to gradually increase domestic goods prices. (October 31, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. government's sudden decision to purchase gold abroad has stunned the entire financial community in Washington, as they all believed that the U.S. President would wait until his domestic purchase plan had been thoroughly tested before expanding it overseas. According to dispatches from various locations, there are varying interpretations of the government's move across the United States. Leaders of the New York financial community mostly believe that the U.S. President will make every effort to avoid a currency war with Britain and France. They hope that the government will cooperate with Britain to stabilize the price of the gold dollar and avoid wild fluctuations. Others predict that the United States will make large purchases of gold in foreign markets, forcing the U.S. dollar to depreciate to its 1926 purchasing power. However, such actions may lead to other countries banning the export of gold. Most bankers are generally opposed to any actions that would disrupt the financial markets. However, their opinions generally acknowledge that this move will likely lead to the most chaotic situation since Roosevelt took office. Observers of current affairs in the financial community mostly state that if a currency war occurs, the only result will be the control of currency and prices falling into the hands of the country with the largest resources. However, regardless of the government's true intentions, the Financial Reconstruction Corporation currently holds $10 billion, which can be used to purchase gold abroad to depreciate the U.S. dollar to the level desired by the U.S. President.

<p>(London) The sudden decision by the United States to enter the world gold market and the various rumors arising therefrom have caused genuine anxiety in financial circles here. Some prominent British economists and currency experts believe that this move by the U.S. President, in terms of controlling currency, should be seen as a relaxation rather than a tightening. They believe that this new gold plan will become a disruptive factor and is not necessary today. Sir Layton stated that the United States was not forced to abandon the gold standard, and the world is now clearly on the road to recovery. The United States should join in the common effort instead of resorting to extreme measures and believes that the U.S. government's recent actions may complicate the control of currency. Many bankers and financial reporters for various newspapers also stated in conversations that it would be extremely disappointing if the United States were to start another currency war at a time when the world seems to be recovering. British bankers are usually very prudent and rarely speak much, but they are now expressing concern that if President Roosevelt's plan proceeds alone without cooperation with Europe, there will be danger ahead. Several methods have now been proposed to avoid the U.S.'s purchase of gold disrupting world currencies. Some people propose convening a currency conference to reach an understanding on the exchange rates between the gold dollar, the British pound, and the French franc. Others suggest reconvening the World Economic Conference, while others advocate negotiations through ordinary diplomatic channels. One banker said that the U.S. government's refusal to clarify its currency position has had an impact that is the opposite of what the U.S. President had hoped for, as this situation will not only not reduce speculation but will increase it. It is also rumored that if the United States makes large purchases abroad, countries on the gold standard will be forced to abandon the gold standard. However, some believe that the meetings between the British and Japanese representatives in Washington with key U.S. government officials are a clear indication that the U.S. President will not begin purchasing gold abroad without first indicating his intentions.

<p>(London) Although Sir Laurence, dispatched by Britain to the United States, intends to meet with U.S. President Roosevelt again, people here believe that negotiations on the war debt issue have reached an impasse. Since Britain and the United States cannot reach an agreement, it is generally believed that the British government may prepare to pay a portion of the debt to show that Britain does not deny the debt.

<p>Prague: The exchange of letters between Roosevelt and Kalinin has made a profound impression on the Czech political community. In recent days, various political parties have planned to raise the issue of establishing normal relations with the Soviet Union. The Peasant Party has resolved to urge the rapid establishment of normal relations between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia and has suggested that the Senate quickly conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union to sign a commercial treaty. The Social Democratic Party in the Senate has also made the same suggestion, adding that the Soviet Union no longer needs to purchase goods from countries that do not recognize it, so it is necessary to immediately conduct negotiations with the Soviet government to recognize the Soviet Union in a legal capacity before the signing of the US-Soviet agreement.

<p>Sofia: Bulgarian King Boris, accompanied by Prime Minister Mushanov, left Ruse for Giurgiu this morning. Giurgiu is located on the Romanian side of the Danube River. Romanian King Carol, accompanied by Prime Minister Vaida and Foreign Minister Titulescu, welcomed them there with grand ceremonies. The two monarchs then crossed the Danube River to Ruse in Bulgaria, where there was a similar welcoming ceremony. Today's meeting between the two monarchs is the first since their accession to the throne after the European War. It is expected to bring closer relations between the countries of the Balkan Peninsula, so public opinion generally attaches great importance to this matter. Moreover, the meeting between the two kings took place in a public manner, with large crowds of people gathered to watch. When the two monarchs met in Ruse and Giurgiu, the troops of both countries fired salutes in honor of them. At the same time, the mayors of the two cities also presented bread and salt to the monarch of the neighboring country to express their welcome. Later, the two kings boarded a warship together and cruised on the Danube River for several hours.</p>
<p>Bulgaria and Romania were enemies during the European War. It is said that Bulgaria hopes to achieve three conditions through this meeting: (1) complete equality of status, (2) protection of the Bulgarian minority in Romania, and (3) revision of all treaties. Whether these hopes can become reality remains to be seen in the future. However, from another perspective, it is feared that both Yugoslavia and Romania are unwilling to make such concessions.

<p>(Geneva) Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson issued a formal notice this morning, deciding that the Disarmament Conference Bureau will still meet on November 9, stating that the Bureau cannot meet earlier due to material difficulties. (October 31, Havas)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although the steering committee of the Disarmament Conference, proposed by Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson, was planned to convene earlier on November 3, hopes for the success of this matter are now gradually shrinking. French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour has now stated that he cannot personally attend on that day because that day is the first time the new French cabinet will attend Parliament. Since Paul-Boncour cannot attend, British Foreign Secretary Simon and Italian representative Aloisi will also not be able to attend. Therefore, all parties here feel that it will be difficult for the steering committee of the Disarmament Conference to convene before the originally scheduled November 9. (October 30, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) U.S. Chief Representative Davis will depart for home today. Various sectors of the League of Nations were greatly surprised upon first hearing this news, believing that the United States must have decided to withdraw, given the hopelessness of disarmament. However, Davis denied this claim to representatives of the press yesterday, stating that his return home should not be seen as the United States no longer being concerned about the work of the Disarmament Conference. He believes that it is best to take advantage of the pause in negotiations to return home and report to President Roosevelt on the development of disarmament. He hopes to return to Geneva before the Disarmament General Committee reconvenes on December 4. After Davis leaves, the U.S. representative in the steering committee will be temporarily replaced by the U.S. Minister to Switzerland. The steering committee is expected to meet on November 9 as previously scheduled. All sectors of the League of Nations have expressed satisfaction that Davis has decided to return to Geneva.

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an informal statement yesterday, stating that Sato's speech at the Disarmament Conference steering committee on the 26th had been misinterpreted by other countries. The statement said that it was an exaggeration to say that Sato's speech on the 26th indicated that Japan would withdraw from the Disarmament Conference. Japan's attitude had been clearly expressed during the meeting between Sato and U.S. representative Davis on the 28th, and there was no intention of withdrawing. There would also be no obstruction to the progress of the conference. The issues of the Disarmament Conference are focused on security guarantees and the right to supervise armaments. However, Japan does have difficulties with the British proposal that should be considered in the future. Japan will adjust the British proposal after the European countries reach an agreement on the two issues of security guarantees and the right to supervise armaments. (October 31, Dentsu Telegram)</p>

From this perspective, it can be said that the conference will completely come to a standstill, depending on the instructions from the Japanese government, and a breakdown is inevitable.

Private businesses, from yesterday afternoon until late at night, conducted emergency negotiations and have reported in detail to the headquarters in Osaka and requested instructions. The textile industry still expressed a strong attitude and continued to refuse to buy Indian cotton, but cotton merchants have gradually weakened, intending to comply with the government and may make some concessions to conclude the conference.

<p>Chongqing correspondence: The Sichuan People's Anti-Bandit Support Association invited Liu Xiang, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan, yesterday at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to announce the bandit suppression strategy and the An'chuan plan. The record of Liu's speech is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e87">Sichuan's Governance <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The political situation in Sichuan is closely related to the problem of suppressing the Reds. We cannot separate bandit suppression from Sichuan's governance, nor can we discuss Sichuan's governance without considering bandit suppression. They are two sides of the same coin. When the 24th and 8th Armies were engaged in discord, the Red Tide in northern Sichuan was surging. Generally, people were deeply concerned that the Tian Army could not resist, feeling that the people's suffering should be eliminated first, and then Sichuan should be secured. I (Liu Xiang refers to himself) repeatedly telegraphed both sides, urging them not to start a war. The Central Government also repeatedly telegraphed to stop them, but to no avail after two days of appeals. Having no choice, I estimated the marching time and resolutely decided to send troops to stop them. At that time, many people suspected that bandit suppression by the Tian Army would be affected, so many held disputes about this matter. However, I determined that the Communists would have difficulty advancing during the An'chuan campaign, and ultimately, as expected, the An'chuan military campaign concluded, and the Red bandits' power remained stagnant. Although some people inevitably viewed this as a civil war, I believed that the political situation in Sichuan had been completely improved by this one stroke, because it is extremely difficult to reduce troops in peacetime, but this time, 60,000 to 70,000 of the 100,000 soldiers of the 24th Army were reduced in one month. From the perspective of the people's burden, this can reduce at least 10 million yuan each year. The 20th Army absorbed the most of the 24th Army's troops, about 70,000, followed by Deng Xihou with about 10,000, and then Li Qixiang and Luo Zezhou with about 5,000 each. However, because I did not have warlike thoughts, I ultimately telegraphed the generals to implement demobilization. When demobilizing, I indeed spent some effort, and even the generals were nervous for me, because Peng and Mei had absorbed more troops than our army. I disregarded everything and ordered it to be implemented in a short period of time, finally achieving the current results. After the commanders of the 24th Army were relieved of their military duties, I gave a speech to them, stating that their past property, regardless of its source, would not be questioned, and even the property of an evildoer like Shi Zhaowu was not confiscated. This was partly to prevent the outflow of Sichuan's economy and partly to avoid the name of being a peer to Xu Xiangqian (Xu is a communist). Although I cannot be sure that all the generals have absolutely no complaints about this approach, they will certainly be fortunate that their troops will ultimately disintegrate and their leaders' property will still be preserved. When I was extremely anxious about the demobilization, the outside world did not investigate and rumors flourished, saying that the 21st Army was expanding its strength, or that I would soon return to Chongqing from Chengdu. In fact, I remained calm. Currently, Liu Wenhui's troops number no more than 7,000 to 8,000. I dare to believe that Sichuan will definitely not have any more wars in the future, because I treat people with sincerity and trust, and people will not treat me with hypocrisy. The military expenditure for this An'chuan campaign amounted to 2 million yuan, but the 11th Army used only one-third of it. From this, it can be seen my sincerity to the armies. However, after the end of the military campaign, I dare not say what achievements it has made, but the public security of the provincial capital and the tax revenues of the prefectures and counties, after my reorganization, have made the armies feel that the methods are convenient and the profits are greater. Compared with the past, when disputes over tax revenues led to armed soldiers robbing in broad daylight, the benefits are much greater. Furthermore, I have always been averse to publicity in my work. When I first arrived at Sanhepu in Chengdu, the press in the provincial capital prepared questions, seeking my answers. The reason why I did not want to answer was the same. The people of southwestern Sichuan have suffered deeply. Even taking my hometown as an example, the burden is not small every year, so I believe that it is impossible to quell the people's resentment without earnestly relieving the people.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Suppressing Bandits <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the An'chuan part, it has been described above. Now, I will speak specifically about suppressing the Reds. Since the Communist Party has disturbed Sichuan, the armies of Liu Ji and Yang Sen have lost cities and territories, which were misled by rumors. Recently, the entire province's goals have been concentrated on bandit suppression, but many of the Sichuan generals still advocate managing the aftermath first. However, the 21st Army believes that unless we resolutely annihilate the Red bandits first, we cannot comfort the people's expectations. However, the 21st Army cannot do this alone, in order to seize all the glory, because this matter is for the benefit of the people, not for private gain. The reason why I delayed taking up the post of Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the past was nothing more than that I did not want to wear the hat of Bandit Suppression while carrying out the reality of An'chuan. The outside world did not investigate and inevitably spread errors. Recently, Deng's army has been unable to send troops for some time due to financial difficulties, which has caused a lot of trouble. However, the generals of Deng's army have mortgaged the red contracts and have not been able to get help from the banking community. What can they do? However, it is too much to blame the banking community, because it seems useless to hold the red contracts. The armies have been seeking consent for a general attack by telegram in recent days, and I am preparing to advance to suppress them. Approximately, after the troops of all routes have completed their concentration, a general attack will be launched. At present, the troops of Zhang Huafeng's brigade of our army are in the Dashiqiao area, where there are no bandit traces. Although more than 200 Communists came to disturb a few days ago, they were quickly repelled. In the future, the military plan will first restore Suiding and Xuanhan, and then attack the four counties of Tongnan, Bayi, and Yi. It is expected that the Red bandits will definitely not dare to fight with their main force and bring about their own defeat. I hope that the military and the people will be united and create a strong anti-Communist atmosphere, then the Red bandits will be suspended in the air and easy to capture, and their original form of being unable to support a three-hour battle will be fully exposed. As for the private deposits of all gentry, there is no need to be alarmed by rumors and easily withdraw them. The Resettlement Committee has now been officially established, and there are many more matters for relief that rely on the people. I hope that similar organizations can continue to be established in various places to promote military-civilian relations. As for the 21st Army's defense zone, it is known for its strict anti-Communism, and even within the troops, the anti-Communist atmosphere is extremely strong. This Red disaster will definitely not invade. We cannot compare Jiangxi and Sichuan. I believe that the Red bandits can be eliminated within three months. Attention should then be paid to developing industries and building up local areas. The 21st Army had already laid the foundation for these two points long ago. In the future, I hope that all sectors of society will earnestly cooperate with the government to carry out these tasks together. Do not alarm each other and hope to escape. I personally consider bandit suppression to be the most glorious undertaking. If I do not immediately eliminate the Red bandits, I will be ashamed of the elders in Sichuan. If I can fully achieve the two goals of no civil war and no Red bandits in Sichuan in the future, I will have nothing else to ask for in this life, and so on. (October 29th)</p>

<p>Nanchang communication: The Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui has issued a special instruction to the provincial governments, ordering them to direct their subordinates to comply with the instruction that local authorities may not arbitrarily collect additional taxes on special goods passing through the region. The original instruction is as follows: "It is found that the Song Department is currently implementing a six-year plan to completely eliminate opium, and during this transitional period, all restrictions on the transportation and sales of special goods, as well as the flexibility of tax regulations, are uniformly regulated. The special tax revenue is relied upon to support the monthly government expenses of Hubei, the dike construction expenses, and all temporary expenditures for bandit suppression in the three provinces, and it has been clearly designated as an important national source of revenue, with all funds being collected and used properly. This is by no means comparable to the secret pursuit of private gain by military warlords and bureaucrats in the past. Therefore, this headquarters has formulated various regulations, which have already been announced and promulgated, and all transportation, sale, and planting are to be managed by the government, with strict bans. Agencies are clearly established, powers and responsibilities are clearly defined, and accumulated abuses are eliminated, transforming private gains into public gains. Regardless of military or political agencies, or any other party, no one may take advantage of the situation to privately solicit fees or arbitrarily disrupt the system. This has been repeatedly emphasized in the records. However, it has been found recently that local troops stationed in various places, as well as administrative agencies and local organizations, often set up various pretexts to privately impose additional fees on special goods passing through or landing in their jurisdictions. Such arbitrary and greedy solicitation and brazen extortion are a serious violation of laws and regulations. Furthermore, the level of tax rates is related to commercial activity, and the gains and losses of production and sales should be considered to determine the burden. This headquarters has deliberated and weighed all factors and has made the most appropriate decisions. If local authorities add additional fees, it will inevitably hinder transportation and sales and delay tax collection. Therefore, this strict warning is issued again. In the future, regardless of whether it is a military or administrative agency or a local organization, if anyone dares to arbitrarily collect fees or recklessly impose additional taxes, they will be punished for corruption and extortion, and the responsible chief officer and head of the organization will be held accountable. In addition to issuing this instruction to various departments, this instruction is issued to the Provincial Government to direct its subordinates to strictly comply, without deviation.

<p>"It is found that the southeastern provinces have long suffered from banditry, and repeated attacks have failed to eliminate them, and the people's livelihood has been exhausted and political effectiveness has gradually been lost. This chairman has inspected the situation and deliberated carefully, and knows that bandit suppression must first cultivate the local vitality, and the cultivation of local vitality is mainly to rectify the politics. Therefore, the various laws and regulations issued by this headquarters have focused on the two major objectives of peaceful and prosperous resettlement, and if they can be implemented with one heart and mind, it will not be difficult to lay the foundation for people's livelihood. However, it has been promulgated for a long time, but the effectiveness has not been achieved, and it is not due to the planning is not good, but due to the implementation is not strong. Now, based on various laws and regulations, this temporary administration outline for bandit suppression areas has been formulated, with a total of thirteen articles, which should be communicated by the provincial governments to their subordinates for uniform compliance, and the commanders-in-chief, commanders, and commanders of each column are responsible for strictly supervising the implementation, so as to achieve the effect of cooperation and protect the people from harm. In addition to issuing this order separately, this temporary administration outline for bandit suppression areas is attached for your immediate compliance.

<p>Shantou Dispatch: Zhu and Mao's bandits' attack on Yanping failed. The central government immediately transferred the 11th Army's Chen Cheng's units, namely Zhou Hunyuan, Xu Kexiang, and Wu Qiwei's divisions, to obliquely exit Lichuan, preparing to coordinate with Liu Heding's division in northern Fujian, in Shunchang and Jiangle, to encircle and suppress the bandits. At that time, the pseudo 135th Army Corps also retreated to the Jiangxi border. On October 13, the bandits began to attack Xinfeng Street, attempting to cut off the central army's continuous horizontal line of defense and break through Guangchang. Fighting until the 18th, the bandits who attacked the nitrate mines of Lichuan were all defeated by Wu and Xu's divisions. The bandits gradually retreated towards Shicheng, Ruijin, Changting, Huichang, Ningdu, and Yudu. Upon hearing the news, the central army further increased its forces on the Fujian-Jiangxi border, aiming to coordinate with the 19th Route Army in northern Fujian to suppress the remaining bandits on the border. The bandits in the Liancheng area, being surrounded on all sides, have also automatically retreated towards Changting. The militia led by Fu Bocui has entered Liancheng. It is learned that there are not many bandits in Changting either. The reason the bandits are reluctant to leave Changting is that behind Changting lies Ruijin, the red central district, and Junmenling, a strategic pass in southern Jiangxi. There are a relatively large number of bandits on Junmenling. Jiang Guangnai went to Guangzhou yesterday to meet with Chen Jitang, reportedly to discuss joint Fujian-Guangdong defense and bandit suppression. For example, if the Guangdong army decides to attack Junmenling, and the 19th Route Army directly takes Changting, it could achieve twice the result with half the effort. If the Guangdong army remains cautious, then Fujian's alone taking Changting will not be beneficial. As for the Guangdong army's movements, it is heard that Yu Hanmou, at the headquarters in southern Dayu, repeatedly summoned generals to discuss the communist suppression plan. Zhang Da's 4th Division is stationed in Xinfeng, having formed a unified force with Wang Zanbin's division stationed in Sannan and Anyuan. Yu also specially dispatched Miao Peinan, Deng Longguang, and Ye Zhao's three divisions to enter Sannan, awaiting orders for a general attack. The troops stationed upstream of Chaozhou and Shantou, such as Huang Renhuan in Jiaoling, Huang Yanzhen in Meixian, and Huang Zhiwen in Xingning, have all convened military officer meetings and are also preparing to attack Jiangxi. Wu Jianwen, the commander of the 5th Squadron of the Air Force stationed in Meixian, has expanded aircraft landing fields in Xingning, Jiaoling, and Pingyuan, and has also transferred a large number of pilots to Meizhou, and added two bombers to Meizhou for use. A large number of military supplies and bombs have also been transported, reportedly to be used for bombing Junmenling during the day. (October 26)</p>

Unexpectedly, local people discovered that he had engaged in corruption and privately sold grain price stabilization rice. Consequently, he was reported to the county court, which sentenced him to imprisonment. Zhu Youzhang refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the High Court. After further trial, he was still sentenced to six months of imprisonment. When it was time for execution, Zhu happened to be working for the Baoshan County Government, so he did not report to the authorities for a long time. Now that his position in Baoshan has been relinquished, Zhu Youzhang, knowing that the prison term was ultimately unavoidable, specially surrendered himself today (31st) and requested execution, and also requested to be detained in the detention center.

In addition, the County Vehicle Management Office has scheduled to examine drivers on November 1. Long-distance bus and car drivers have been notified in advance, and the county's rickshaws will be inspected from December 1 to rectify them.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Female Workers Petition at the Chamber of Commerce, Causing Disturbance <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>After Xi Huian, the owner of the Huisheng Silk Factory near Huigong Bridge, absconded due to debt, creditors and the County Chamber of Commerce are trying to find Xi and return him to Wuxi to manage the situation. The news has already been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Xi also owes the factory's workers two months' wages. The first month, September, amounts to 29 and a half days, requiring more than 10,000 yuan. The Workers' Union posted a warning, limiting Xi to five days to come forward and handle the matter. After seeing the newspaper report, Xi only sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the eight dan of silk stored in the factory be sold to pay off the debt. If it is not enough, the factory's property should be auctioned off to compensate. The Chamber of Commerce was verifying the letter when, unexpectedly, more than 300 workers from the factory suddenly flocked to the County Chamber of Commerce to petition yesterday afternoon. The staff side appointed work director Fei Canchen as their representative, while the workers' side appointed Jiang Gendi, Zhang Sanjie, and twelve others as their representatives. At that time, Yang Hanxi, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and Qian Sunqing, the supervisor, were both present at the meeting. They immediately summoned Fei Canchen inside to inquire about the purpose of the visit. Meanwhile, Sun Zhongjie, a member of the second branch of the Public Security Bureau, arrived at the meeting to maintain order. Then, Ji Zhongzhen, a staff member of the Chamber of Commerce, together with Fei Canchen and Officer Sun, announced the content of Xi's letter to the workers, instructing them to wait quietly for a resolution. Unexpectedly, the workers firmly refused, shouting and arguing, and the order was immediately disrupted. The Chamber of Commerce, fearing an accident, separately telegraphed the Public Security Bureau to send inspectors Sun Hao and Chen Zongshou to lead the police to the scene to suppress the situation. At the same time, the police brigade also sent Zhu Wenying, the commander of the second company, to lead a squad of police officers, and Sun Zhongjie, a member of the second branch of the Public Security Bureau, also mobilized two police officers to the meeting to suppress the situation. Qian Sunqing and other members of the Chamber of Commerce personally came out to persuade them, but the workers could not be reasoned with, and the order became more chaotic. They damaged a large vegetable table, a redwood hundred-eye table, several grand master chairs, and more than ten pieces of glass. At that time, Wang Wei, the captain of the police brigade, Jin Shiqi, the inspector general of the Public Security Bureau, and Cheng Xu, the director of the second branch, arrived at the meeting one after another, seeing that the situation was serious. After further discussions with the members, Fei Canchen went outside to announce that the first month's (September) wages would be paid first on November 3, and then other matters would be handled. The workers considered it satisfactory and immediately withdrew, and the matter was finally resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Widening of Sanxiatang Achieved <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The case of widening Sanxiatang Straight Street in this county has been brewing for five or six years, and has been repeatedly twisted, but has not yet been realized. Since Yan Shenyu came to the county as the magistrate, he embraced the determination to widen the street, and ordered the Municipal Engineering Office to actively handle it. He has already submitted a request to the Construction Department to use 9,000 yuan of land donation for road construction. In addition, the Municipal Fund and Property Management Committee allocated 9,000 yuan to the Public Works Review Committee, which repeatedly discussed the progress. Yesterday, the County Government Municipal Engineering Office held the second Public Works Review Committee meeting to discuss the issue of widening Sanxiatang. Chairman Zhang Fulin discussed: 1. The resolution of the first meeting of this committee to discuss the various projects of paving Sanxiatang Street was changed from the original plan. After re-budgeting, more than 20,200 yuan are needed, exceeding the original budget by more than 2,000 yuan. It is not easy to raise money. How should it be handled? It was resolved that the road surface and bridges should still be handled according to the original budget approved by the Construction Department, and the ditches should be handled according to the first resolution of this committee. 2. It was resolved that the houses along Sanxiatang Street should, from January 1, 1924, to the end of February, all be automatically conceded in accordance with the county's determined widening scale. If they are overdue, workers will be hired to demolish them on their behalf, and the county will issue a notice to inform them. 3. The county magistrate approved the addition of Miao Picheng, Qin Xiaopu, Qian Sunqing, Gu Binsheng, Xu Yongji, Wei Maowen, and Ni Xiangqing as members of the Sanxiatang Street Widening Committee. 4. After discussing the invitation to contractors to manage the Tonghui Road project, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>In June of this year, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Wuyi County seized a large batch of smuggled yarn at the Lihua Cloth Factory in Qitaiyan. They immediately took it to the meeting for disposal and should pay a fine of 14,300 yuan. At that time, the factory said that cotton yarn brokers Li Shousan hoped to muddle through the transportation to Changzhou and did not recognize private entry. The payment was delayed. The association immediately summoned Lin Youman, the accountant of the factory, to the meeting and sent him to the Public Security Bureau for detention in the detention center on July 30. It has been three months. The case has not yet been resolved. Lin was imprisoned for a long time and was extremely depressed. On the night of the 29th of this month, he suddenly wrapped his neck with his belt and strangled himself to death. On the morning of the 30th, the cook of the Public Security Bureau sent breakfast, but Lin was completely silent. It was discovered that Lin was lying stiff in bed. The bureau, knowing that the matter was serious, immediately reported it to the county court and sent personnel for inspection, and notified the Anti-Japanese Association. The Anti-Japanese Association immediately convened an emergency meeting and decided to report the situation to the county and transfer it to the provincial party headquarters, and notify the Lihua Factory to come to the city to collect the body. The body was inspected by the county court, and the chief prosecutor Yang Kongxi arrived for inspection and confirmed that the death was indeed self-strangulation.</p>

<p>The areas along the Jiang River in Langshan, Nantong, have suffered greatly from the tidal disaster. Currently, the landslide on the Jiang shore is worsening. Local communities are urgently seeking to protect the landslide, raise funds for disaster relief, and present the case to the province, requesting assistance in accordance with the Jiangnan pond project treatment and allocate funds to subsidize Nantong's repair and construction. The Provincial Government specially ordered County Magistrate Cheng to quickly investigate and determine the actual situation of the tidal disaster and the budget for the landslide protection project, and submit it for review.</p>

<p>County Magistrate Zhang Qingze has been in office for five months and has disagreements with county committee members Chen Dihou and Chen Xunru, resulting in the simultaneous resignation of twelve committee members. Subsequently, the County Chamber of Commerce, the County Education Association, the Money Industry Association, the Rice Industry Association, the Dried Goods Industry Association, the Cocoon Industry Association, the Sock Industry Association, the Oil and Liquor Industry Association, the Tea Industry Association, the Reed Mat and Jute Industry Association, the Paper and Foil Association, the Chinese Medicine Association, the Fur Association, the Tea Shop Association, the Women's Association, the Pharmaceutical Profession Association, the Garment Workers' Union, the Barber Workers' Union, and the County Fund Property Custody, etc., accused him of ten major crimes to the province: (1) deprivation of tenant farmers' interests, (2) trampling on human rights, (3) accepting bribes, (4) hindering the prohibition of opium, (5) taking advantage of power for extortion, (6) allowing the police to harm the people, (7) engaging in corruption and fraud, (8) insulting the press, (9) violating the oath, and (10) disagreements. The provincial government is investigating and verifying the complaint. Now, the case of arresting the commoner Cao Wenbiao from Zhapu has caused a storm, and the public offices of all four districts of the county and their affiliated township offices have submitted a complaint and sent representatives Lin Yangfu and others to Jin to meet with the authorities and petition.</p>

<p>The Zhaotianhou Temple in Dangtan, Jinze Town, north of the county, has a prosperous incense offering season every year during the Double Ninth Festival, with ships gathering from as far as Shanghai and Hangzhou. This year, the atmosphere of bandits is rampant, so robberies of fragrant boats often occur. The day before yesterday (the 28th), in the surrounding Dang area, a fragrant boat from Jiaxing with dozens of pilgrims on board sailed into the Dang area. Suddenly, three or four bandit boats stopped them and robbed them for a long time, causing considerable losses. After the incident, the leader of the boat reported to the Jinze Security Group. The Security Group immediately dispatched a team to cooperate with the water and land police to hunt down the bandits, but the bandits had disappeared without a trace.</p>

<p>The first A group of the Third District Security Group in the county arrested two suspected bandits, Li Jinshan and Zhou Desheng, in Xinzhou Township on the 29th. They immediately reported to the district headquarters and waited for good news.

Tao, the concurrent district head and group leader, led a team to search from land, and the Zhongzhen steamboat of the stationed Zhongmatou water police intercepted the Jiang River surface. They intercepted a bandit boat about two li away from the Jiang River and captured Chang Deyi, Chang Debai, Chang Zhou, and the young Chang Shengen, who claimed to be the boat owners, as well as boatmen Gao Guishan, bandits Chen Zibin, Qian Siyang, Chen, and eight others. At the same time, Wang Afu was captured in Zaixingzhou. According to the confessions of the suspects, they planned to rob a wealthy household in Xinwawu that night, and go to Xiannv Town to kidnap someone. Based on the confessions, the district group escorted the eleven captured persons and the boats to the city overnight and sent them to the county for disposal.</p>

Later, Chairman Wang Hongzao visited County Magistrate Yang and requested their release. County Magistrate Yang released the shop assistants and ordered the military and police to only recruit and not forcibly take them. This morning, all the shops opened for business.</p>

<h3 id="e108">President Wang Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning and Returned to Nanjing in the Evening, Delivering Important Remarks to the Press Corps, Song Has Agreed to Remain as a Standing Member of the Economic Committee, There Are Currently No Changes in the Central Political Situation, Focusing on Bandit Suppression and National Defense for Domestic Policies, Foreign Policy Toward Japan Remains Based on the Original Guidelines, Kong Xiangxi Scheduled to Arrive in Nanjing Today to Take Office <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei left Nanjing the night before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. He came to console Mr. Song and persuade him to return to Nanjing as soon as possible to preside over the affairs of the Economic Committee, and to urge Minister of Finance Kong to take office in Nanjing immediately. It is now learned that Mr. Song has agreed to complete the handover of the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai before returning to Nanjing. Mr. Kong traveled to Nanjing in the same train as President Wang last night and will take office at the Ministry of Finance this morning. President Wang also met with reporters from various newspapers at his private residence last night, speaking freely about politics and diplomacy, and clearly stated that the government will focus on consolidating national defense and suppressing the Communist bandits in the future. The policy towards Japan will not change. The various news items are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Wang's Mission to Shanghai</p>
<p>President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei, accompanied by his wife Chen Bijun, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Cuiming, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tang Youren, Chairman of the Construction Committee Zhang Jingjiang, and Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua, left Nanjing in the same train the night before yesterday at 11:00 PM. Mr. Wang and his wife arrived at Nanxiang at 7:04 AM yesterday morning, got off the train, and changed to a car to come to Shanghai. The others got off the train at the North Station at about 8:00 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Consoling Mr. Song <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Song Ziwen's statement to reporters yesterday, the standing membership of the Economic Committee is still under consideration, and he will temporarily stay in Shanghai to rush the handover and will not enter Nanjing for the time being. The second standing committee meeting of the Economic Committee, originally scheduled to be held in Nanjing yesterday, could not be held. President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei specially went to Mr. Song's residence on Qiqi Road immediately after arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning to visit Mr. Song, expressed his condolences in person, and persuaded Mr. Song to return to Nanjing as soon as possible to preside over the affairs of the Economic Committee and various international technical tasks. He talked for twenty minutes and left at 8:50 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Urging Kong to Take Office <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>At the same time, with the imminent general offensive for the suppression of bandits and the importance of military expenses, the government's financial management cannot be without someone for even a day. Mr. Wang sent Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi to visit the newly appointed Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi at his private residence on West Aihams Road at 9:40 AM yesterday morning, urging him to take office in Nanjing immediately. It is heard that Mr. Kong expressed his determination to enter Nanjing that evening and take office tomorrow (i.e., today). Mr. Chu left at 10:10 AM. Mr. Kong then went to the Central Bank to work.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Visiting Zhang and Li <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>After visiting Minister Kong, Mr. Wang drove to the World Society on Ferguson Road at 9:30 AM to visit Li Shizeng and Zhang Jingjiang, members of the Central Committee. Mr. Zhang Jingjiang left after only twenty minutes of conversation. Mr. Wang and Li Shizeng then continued their conversation until 11:15 AM. Mr. Wang then left and went straight back to Mr. Chu's residence on Albert Road to rest. The content of the discussions between Wang and Li concerned important issues in the recent political situation.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Kong and Others Visit Wang <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, visited Mr. Wang on Bubbling Well Road at 3:40 PM after meeting with Wang Jingwei and Zhang Jingjiang yesterday morning. At that time, Railway Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi were also present. They talked for about forty minutes and left at 4:30 PM, followed by the newly appointed Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, who visited and talked for about half an hour, leaving at 5:10 PM. Then, at 5:00 PM, he met with the Mayor of Shanghai Wu Tiecheng and talked for more than forty minutes. After that, he met with Du Yuesheng. After about ten minutes, he met with reporters from various newspapers.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Entering Nanjing That Evening <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>President Wang completed his official business in Shanghai and took the train to Nanjing with the newly appointed Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and Railway Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming at 12:00 PM last night. As for Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, he asked the Executive Yuan for leave to rest in Shanghai for a few days, so he did not travel together last night.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Wang Delivers Remarks <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>President Wang met with reporters from various newspapers at about 6:00 PM yesterday. More than twenty people arrived, and he had detailed talks on diplomatic and domestic situations. The remarks are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Song Will Return to Nanjing Immediately <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang said that Mr. Song's resignation from the positions of Minister of Finance and Vice President of the Executive Yuan was decided very early. However, the successor and various preparations were not complete, fearing that it would have an impact, so it was not announced to the outside world. I originally intended to come to Shanghai earlier, but after receiving a telegram from Mr. Song, stating that before the successor to the resignation was determined, please do not come to Shanghai. Later, Mr. Song came to Nanjing, so it was delayed for another day. It was not until today that I was able to come to Shanghai. I have now met with Mr. Song twice and urged Mr. Song to preside over the affairs of the Economic Committee. Mr. Song said that he is currently busy with the handover of the Ministry of Finance and will not be able to go to Nanjing in the near future. Once all the matters are ready, he will go to Nanjing immediately. The standing committee meeting of the Economic Committee must be attended by all three standing members before it can be held, so Mr. Sun Zhesheng and I are still waiting for Mr. Song to enter Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Wang is Not Passive <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>When asked by reporters whether there was any truth to the rumors that Mr. Wang was being passive, Mr. Wang replied, "In short, it is extremely difficult to be responsible for national affairs. My attitude has not changed completely from April of this year to the present. Now that government affairs are so complicated, the authorities often feel that it is difficult to take measures. If someone can have a better way, they are willing to take responsibility. We can get rid of it at any time. Otherwise, we should try our best to maintain the current situation. If we suddenly retreat at this time, wouldn't we put the country in a more difficult situation? This must not be done by those who are loyal to the country."</p>
<h3 id="e117">Diplomatic Policy <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>When asked by reporters about the rumors that Mr. Song's resignation was related to diplomatic issues, Mr. Wang replied, "I would like to tell you about this issue. Since the September 18th Incident, the National Government has only had one path to take in its diplomatic policy. The decision of this policy is completely based on facts. Since there is only one policy, there is naturally no such thing as a dispute over diplomatic opinions. The current diplomatic policy is to sort out internal affairs and strengthen national power before we can talk about diplomacy. Our country strives to maintain peace in the Far East and the world, but to seek peace, we must first have strength. Therefore, at present, there is no second diplomatic policy other than strengthening national power. The rumors that Mr. Song's resignation was due to a conflict of diplomatic opinions are not accurate. The issue of Japan has always恪遵with the principles listed in the July 28th telegram, resolutely refusing to recognize the puppet state of Manchuria and resolutely refusing to cede territory. There is nothing else to say. As for the rumors that Minister Luo's resignation was threatened by someone, it is also absolutely untrue."</p>
<h3 id="e118">Northeast Problem <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>As for the rumors that Envoy Jiang went to Japan, Japanese Envoy Arima Yoshi entered Nanjing to entertain, and then went north, and that Li Zeyi went to Japan, are all facts. Does that mean that direct negotiations and partial solutions to the Northeast problem are about to begin? The rumors are completely inaccurate. The Japanese envoy went to Nanjing and Peiping for routine receptions. Li Zeyi went there for private matters, and Jiang went back to his post. As for the issues of traffic, mail, and tariffs on the Beining Road, the Peiping Political Affairs Committee is a local administrative organ. All major issues are subject to the orders of the Central Government. The traffic issue belongs to the Ministry of Railways, the postal issue belongs to the Ministry of Communications, and the tariff issue belongs to the Ministry of Finance. What power does the Peiping Political Affairs Committee have to negotiate separately with the Japanese puppets? The same cannot be denied. Moreover, the postal services of all countries in the world do not communicate with the puppet states. How can our country communicate with them?</p>
<h3 id="e119">Luo Will Return to Nanjing Immediately <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Wenkan went to Xinjiang to express condolences, first to Dihua, Turpan, and Ili, to meet with Sheng, Liu, Ma Zhongying, and Zhang Peiwen to convey the intentions of the Central Government. He then met with Ambassador Yan Huiqing in Tacheng and took the Trans-Siberian Railway to Vladivostok, having boarded a ship to Shanghai, which will arrive in Tianjin in three days, and then south to Nanjing. As for the foreign reports that Mr. Luo met with Vice Chairman Karakhan of the Soviet People's Foreign Affairs Committee to discuss the cancellation of the Xinjiang Trade Agreement, it is not true, because Mr. Luo's passage through Russia was purely a transit and had no diplomatic mission. There is also a saying that Zhang Xueliang intended to fly to Russia to meet with Luo, which is even more absurd. As for whether Mr. Luo will return to his original post as Minister of Foreign Affairs, it will be decided after Mr. Luo arrives in Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Denying Secret Agreements <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>As for Jin Shuren's private trade agreement with the Soviet Union, the government will never recognize its validity. Jin has now been handed over to the Capital Police Department for detention and transferred to the court for handling. His crimes are from three aspects: (1) According to the reports of Special Commissioner Huang Musong and Minister Luo Wenkan, Jin abused his power in Xinjiang, such as privately signing treaties with foreign countries. In the old imperial era, he would have been sentenced to death. (2) He was impeached by the Control Yuan and will be transferred to the Official Disciplinary Committee for punishment. (3) The people of Xinjiang repeatedly complained to the Central Government about illegal cases and crimes of abuse of power, which were sent to the judiciary for investigation. The prosecutor has begun to investigate and can handle the case according to law, so that Jin can be punished for his crimes.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Cotton and Wheat Loan <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Following the resignation of Finance Minister Sung, the position is now held by Minister Kong. During the Northern Expedition in the 15th year of the Republic, Sung went to Wuhan, and Kong served as acting finance minister in Guangdong. Therefore, Minister Kong has rich experience in financial management. Today's financial problems still prioritize military expenditure for suppressing bandits. However, the cotton and wheat loan will definitely not be diverted. The cotton and wheat loan amounts to 50 million US dollars, equivalent to only 156 million national currency. Moreover, it is not current cash. However, the requests for appropriations from various provinces and central ministries total as much as 1.15 billion yuan. The proposed plans are all very crucial, exceeding the loan by seven or eight times. Therefore, the government will adhere to the original plan and concentrate on production, and will definitely not allow it to be diverted for military expenditure. As for the sale of cotton and wheat, it will be managed by the Cotton and Grain Control Council in the future. Currently, because the cotton and wheat are arriving in China in batches and need to be sold to convert into cash, the production plan has not been implemented quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Pay Attention to National Defense <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>When asked by reporters whether there would be any changes in the recent political situation, Wang replied that there would be no changes in the short term. He was then asked that with the Far Eastern situation becoming increasingly serious and war almost unavoidable in the next three to four years, whether the government had a policy to deal with the imminent key to our country's strength or weakness, survival or demise. Wang replied that the government was doing its best to pay attention to this. In view of the active containment of the Jiangxi communist bandits during the battles of Shanghai and North China, we are clear that it is impossible to deal with foreign aggression without suppressing the communist bandits. Therefore, suppressing the bandits is the initial step in building national defense.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Issue of Political Power <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The reporter also asked whether anyone would obstruct the implementation of the central government's plans due to the issue of political power. Wang replied that there was absolutely no such thing. Commander-in-Chief Chiang and his brothers all have the greatest determination to do their best for the country. If anyone can propose a better plan and is willing to take responsibility, they can step aside at any time. They are absolutely unwilling to sacrifice national strength and engage in internal strife.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Kong Takes Office This Morning <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The new Minister of Finance, Kong Xiangxi, has been making arrangements in Shanghai for several days and is handling the handover with former Minister Sung. Urged by President Wang, he decided to enter Beijing last night and arrived at the ministry this morning to assume his duties. As for the candidates for vice minister of finance, Kong discussed them with President Wang yesterday afternoon. Kong expressed that it would be best to retain the two vice ministers, Zou Lin and Li Tiao-sheng, to utilize their expertise. However, the two have already submitted their resignations, and whether they can be retained needs to be decided upon arrival in Beijing. There are rumors that Zhang Shouyong and Cheng Shudu will succeed as vice ministers of finance, but according to Zhang, who was visited by reporters, this is completely inaccurate. He is old and weak, and under no circumstances will he take on the important position of vice minister of finance. After withdrawing from the financial world during the January 28th Incident, he does not want to enter the official career again.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Persuaded to Take on the Difficult Task <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>According to a certain important person close to Minister Kong yesterday, after Minister Sung resigned, the Central Political Council appointed Kong to succeed him last Sunday. Kong is full of a sense of responsibility and has great enthusiasm for improving the current financial situation. Therefore, even though he took office at a time when the financial situation was exhausted, he did not dare to hesitate and decisively decided to take over the job in one day. It was also said that since the resignation of Sung became a reality, the affairs of the Ministry of Finance have fallen into a state of leaderlessness, and the instability of the financial world is an undeniable fact. Therefore, Kong knew that the difficulties were heavy, and after Chiang, Wang, and Sung strongly urged him, he agreed to take on the difficult task, regardless of everything. The important person also said that Kong's policy direction should take Sung's past achievements as a blueprint, following the old ways, which may be more effective. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi.</p>
<p>The burden on the people is becoming increasingly heavy, so Kong's plan to enrich the national treasury is to focus on rectifying the existing tax revenue without adding new taxes, so that the people can rest and recuperate. Continued on page 13.</p>

<p>Silk factories in this city are unable to maintain operations due to sluggish sales and falling market prices. The factories previously convened a meeting of the trade association to discuss setting up a sales organization to promote sales and to appropriately reduce wages. After deducting the three items of silkworm moth, promotion, and Sunday allowances, the wages were reduced from 50 cents to 42 cents per day. Because the workers' lives were difficult, negotiations were conducted. On the 27th, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a mediation, but no result was obtained. The two parties were instructed to go out and negotiate on their own. An agreement was reached yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e140">Negotiated Solution <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Recently, because the end of the month was approaching, the two parties negotiated for several days. The investors still believe that the silk market has stagnated, prices have fallen, and the factories have tried their best to start operations for the sake of the workers' livelihoods, but the goods are still stockpiled and unsold. In this city, it has reached about 10,000 dan, and no one is willing to buy them. Therefore, they had no choice but to reduce wages, otherwise, they would have to close down. The workers also fully understand the overall situation. Therefore, after negotiations between the two parties yesterday, a compromise was adopted. Starting from October 1, the first-class wage was reduced to 45 cents per day, and the rest were calculated by analogy. This case was successfully resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Submit to the Bureau for Record <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Silk Factory Trade Association submitted the details of the matter to the Social Affairs Bureau for record. The original text reads: "Submitted for the purpose of reporting the wage cut method negotiated by the labor and management of silk factories, requesting inspection and filing. The association previously determined that the silk market was declining and silk factories were closing down one after another. After a public resolution by the trade association, the three items of Sunday reward, promotion, and worker silkworm moth allowance have reached the end of the investigation period and will no longer be issued starting from the first of this month. The wage item will be temporarily calculated at 42 cents per day according to the precedents of previous years. On the 2nd of this month, we asked your bureau for approval to implement it. Subsequently, we received instructions and convened a mediation on file. Now, in addition to the three items of Sunday reward, promotion, and silkworm moth allowance, as stated in the mediation record, they will no longer be issued after the expiration date. All female workers' wages have been negotiated by the labor and management themselves. Starting from October, the first-class wage will be reduced to 45 cents per day, and the rest will be calculated by analogy. We hereby submit a document requesting your bureau to approve the filing. It is for the public convenience. Submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau."</p>

<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a document from the Standing Committee of the Jilin Volunteer Army Headquarters yesterday, reporting on the investigation of the puppet state's situation and the achievements of the Jilin Volunteer Army, requesting review and approval. The headquarters sent Yu Jizhen to various parts of Jilin on August 19 to investigate the number and achievements of the Volunteer Army and the situation of the puppet state to facilitate strategic planning. On October 6, the officer returned to Peiping and reported the following:</p>
<h3 id="e144">Number of Volunteer Army <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>According to the announcement by the Japanese Kwantung Army on September 10, the number of Volunteer Army in the whole Manchuria was 210,000 at its peak last year, and there are still 95,000 this year. Last year, the Volunteer Army was in a group style, which was easy to suppress. This year, it has been fragmented, which is difficult to deal with. The number of battles fought last year was 482, and from January to August this year, it has reached 396. In August this year alone, 21 Japanese officers below the rank of captain died and 46 were injured. Although the number of casualties of Japanese soldiers has not been announced, there are many casualties of Japanese soldiers in each battle, but the number cannot be investigated. The Japanese military announced that the number of Volunteer Army in Jilin was more than 18,670, and a table is attached below. However, the actual number of each unit is more than twice as much as that announced by the Japanese military. According to Yu Chengceng, commander of the puppet state's Railway Protection Army, the total number of Volunteer Army in Jilin Province is more than 100,000. This number is very consistent with the number investigated by Ji Zhen. According to Manchuria Daily, there are more than 300 units of Fei Army in the eastern section of the China Eastern Railway, with an average of more than 200 people in each unit. This section alone has more than 60,000 people.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Work Situation <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Now the Volunteer Army in each unit has two years of experience, so the work method is also more perfect than before. According to Ji Zhen's investigation, except for the two units of Chen Chongfang and Baisha Association, which occupy the natural terrain in northeastern Jilin, their troops are still in a group style. In addition, the Volunteer Army in Jihai, Jitun, Jichang, and the China Eastern Railway are scattered in small groups. The largest group has no more than two or three hundred people, and they act quickly. They either attack Japanese military camps or destroy railways. During Ji Zhen's investigation in Jilin City, the railways were destroyed five times in just twelve days (twice on Jihai Road, once on Jitun Road, and twice on China Eastern Railway). Each time, several trains were destroyed and several Japanese officers and soldiers were killed. Chen Chong's work performance in northeastern Jilin is the best. He is still occupying Raohe, Baoqing, Hulin, Boli, and Fujin counties. Secondly, Song Guorong's unit harasses and attacks along Jihai Road, and Luo Mingxing's unit harasses and attacks along Jichang Road, causing great disturbance to the Japanese army. Other small units have considerable achievements.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Difficulties of the Volunteer Army <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Because each unit of the Volunteer Army has no source of funds and weapons, they inevitably have to solicit them locally, and their behavior is inevitably the same as bandits. On the one hand, the villages are supervised by the puppet state to establish village regiments to resist the Volunteer Army. On the other hand, the Japanese army uses artillery fire to destroy the villages where the Volunteer Army lives. In order to protect their lives and property, the people also resist the Volunteer Army with all their strength. As a result, the solicitation of funds and weapons becomes more difficult. Each unit of the Volunteer Army is caught in the suffering of having the heart to love the country but not having the power to kill the enemy. Fortunately, the puppet state's army secretly provides assistance, which can still maintain operations. Otherwise, even without the Japanese army's oppression, it would be difficult to exist.</p>
<h3 id="e147">People's Hearts in the Northeast <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Because the people of the Northeast are oppressed by the Japanese, they eagerly hope that the national army will leave the customs and recover the lost land. Although the people have been organized into people's self-defense forces by the puppet state to resist the Volunteer Army, if the national army can leave the customs, the people's self-defense forces will surely respond everywhere and stir up the rear of the Japanese army, which will have the effect of attacking from inside and outside. If the government continues to delay dealing with Japan, and waits for the Japanese army to confiscate the guns of the people's self-defense forces, the people will have the heart to love the country, but will only suffer from being empty-handed.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Military Hearts in the Northeast <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Ji Zhen contacted the officers who led the troops in Changchun, Binjiang, and Jilin, and they all said that during the battle of Weijiafengkou last spring, the Japanese civilian and military officials in the Northeast were panic-stricken and tried their best to be close to the Chinese and asked them to protect their lives in times of crisis. The officers and soldiers were also eager to kill the enemy and respond to the national army in order to recover the Northeast. Although there is no opportunity to respond now, the heart of rebellion is very eager. The senior military officers may be inclined to Japan in order to preserve their official positions, but the junior military officers and soldiers can rebel as soon as they have the opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Confiscation of People's Guns <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the confiscation of people's guns in the counties along the Beining Railway has begun. The procedure for handing over guns is to use the excuse of organizing people's self-defense forces to order the people to hand over their guns and report to the government, issue licenses, and take a photo of each gun for the government to keep for reference. It will be handed over completely before June of next year to eliminate the people's resistance.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Opening of Automobile Roads <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese in the Northeast are suffering from the unpredictable movements of the Volunteer Army and cannot be suppressed. All counties that do not have trains have built automobile roads. Other more important cities, or places where the Volunteer Army often resides, are forced to build automobile roads to facilitate the Japanese army's movements.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Seizing Railway Administration <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The China Eastern Railway is now renamed the North Manchuria Railway. The Jichang, Jitun, and Duntuu railways are renamed the Jingtu Railway. It was officially established on September 1. The South Manchuria Railway now has a railway administration to govern all railways in the Northeast. All railways are interconnected and directly opened to traffic. All matters are under the jurisdiction of the railway administration. In essence, the railway administration is equivalent to a puppet state's railway department, and all railways have become the South Manchuria Railway's feeder lines.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Puppet State's Finances <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>After the establishment of the puppet state, the Central Bank of Manchuria was established. All donations, taxes, and rents are limited to the currency of the Central Bank of Manchuria. Even silver dollars are not allowed to be collected. Other Feng tickets, Ha tickets, Ji tickets, Jitie, Jiang tickets, and Jiangtie are all limited to being collected before June 1 of next year.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Public Sale of Opium <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The puppet state has established an opium monopoly, with the head office in Changchun. In addition, 1,200 branch offices have been established in four provinces, contracted by merchants. Each branch office must deposit 10,000 yuan. Each branch office has several retail outlets below it. There are 40 retail outlets in Changchun City, and each outlet must pay a deposit of 500 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Massacre of People <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Detectives are densely distributed in cities and villages. Anyone involved in national salvation work is arrested and massacred by the Japanese army. Whether they confess or not, they are beaten to death, especially intellectuals.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Establishment of Various Companies <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Monopolizing profits, all puppet state's industries have been established as large companies to take over, canceling all small companies, such as electric companies, forestry companies, milling companies, gold mining companies, etc. The managers are all Japanese, and 80-90% of the capital is also Japanese. Except for these companies, others are not allowed to run the industry.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Colonial Education <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Japanese has become the main subject in schools everywhere. The second subject is the Five Classics and Four Books. Other sciences that study national and ethnic thought are prohibited. Righteousness associations and Great Harmony Buddhist associations are organized to promote fatalistic superstitions and other theories to fool the people and implement colonial education.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Active Immigration <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>After the Northeast Incident, Japan repeatedly organized immigration to the Northeast. Later, due to the active activities of the Volunteer Army in various places, many of the people who moved to the Northeast were massacred. Even the original overseas Chinese, due to various special circumstances, have returned to their country in large numbers. Since the Tanggu Truce, the Volunteer Army in various places has suffered a major blow, and Japan's immigration policy has been actively carried out again.</p>
<p>Now the number of Volunteer Army in the four eastern provinces, if calculated accurately, is more than 200,000. The Manchurian army and people's self-defense forces in various places, although now under the control of the puppet state, can immediately rebel when the central government declares war on Japan and respond to the national army. At least 2 million internal anti-Japanese troops in the Northeast can be mobilized. However, if the government continues to delay for a long time, it will give Japan time to suppress the Volunteer Army, confiscate the guns of the people's self-defense forces, and eliminate the anti-Japanese strength of the people in the Northeast. After a few years, it will be more difficult. Fortunately, Japan's implementation of a massacre policy has created a deep hatred with the people. The puppet state's construction army has been eliminated as much as possible, and new people have been reorganized into the national security army. The officers of the former construction army have either been laid off or brutally killed, and the officers of the newly formed national security army are also in constant danger. In this cruel suspicion, a line of opportunity has been created for the Northeast, which is the most unfortunate of the unfortunate. The above are all the results of Ji Zhen's on-the-spot investigation. They should be presented together for review and approval. Attached is a list of the number of leaders and work areas, totaling 44 leaders stationed in Panshi, Fuyu, Fangzheng, Yimianpo, and Dongning.</p>

<p>Implemented Today: Eleven routes including Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai), Huhangyong (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo), Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou), Beining (Beijing-Shenyang), Jiaoji (Jiaozhou-Jinan), Longhai (Lanzhou-Haizhou), Pinghan (Beijing-Hankou), Pingsui (Beijing-Suiyuan), Zhengtai Daoxing (Zhengding-Taiyuan Daokou-Jincheng), Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) Route, Xiang'e (Hunan-Hubei) Section, etc., which are participating in national railway freight joint transport, have, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Railways, followed the interim measures for joint transport, the current general rules for freight car transport, the current general rules for responsible freight car transport, detailed rules for handling affairs, regulations on waybill procedures, detailed rules for handling, and domestic joint transport regulations, and are scheduled to implement them on November 1. For full-car freight, the limits are 15 tons, 20 tons, 30 tons, and 40 tons. Consolidated less-than-carload freight is not temporarily applicable to joint transport. If a single piece of freight weighs more than three metric tons, has a volume of more than five cubic feet, or its joint transport length spans two or more cars, the originating route must first consult with all routes and obtain their consent before joint transport can proceed.</p>
<p>Temporary Measures: After the Shanghai-Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration received instructions from the Ministry to prepare for the implementation of national railway freight joint transport, it decided that freight cars Nos. 311 to 316 and Shanghai-Beijing freight cars Nos. 401 and 402 would handle joint transport. All license plates used for joint transport freight are marked with a red "Joint" character and are scheduled to be implemented today. Due to the Pukou dockworkers on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway demanding relief and blocking freight cars from boarding the ferry to cross the river, it has been decided to temporarily suspend the transfer of freight from the Shanghai Mekan Road Station and Hangzhou Zha Kou to the joint transport stations of various railways onto ferries. Freight crossing the river will still be loaded and unloaded by workers and transferred across the river. As for the Shanghai-Beijing direct freight cars, they will remain temporarily suspended. As for the joint transport freight from various railways to Shanghai-Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, they will also be loaded and unloaded by workers at the Pukou riverside and transferred across the river.</p>

<p>The Sanshan Guildhall replied to the letter from the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, stating: Respectfully, we received your letter of the 28th of this month, which roughly stated: The National Products Introduction Center of our association shipped 16 pieces of cloth to Fuzhou in September via the Jiesheng steamboat. After arrival in Fuzhou, the steamboat company claimed that the Shanghai customs broker telegraphed an order to return the goods and prohibited the consignee from taking delivery, etc. After a detailed inquiry, it was learned that the telegram was sent by Yongshengtai Customs Broker under your association's order. Such actions could easily be resolved according to law. However, considering that we are all compatriots, we are reluctant to cause social criticism and leave room for foreign criticism due to internal disputes. Therefore, we have been patient and cautious, and have repeatedly tried to negotiate amicably. However, your association has not investigated and has continued to force us, resulting in the Three North Company refusing to transport the goods again on the 23rd of this month. In summary, all the directives originated from your association, which is very alarming. After investigation, Yongshengtai Customs Broker has the freedom to operate and has no contractual relationship with our guildhall. All actions of Yongshengtai do not need to be based on the intentions of our guildhall members. Our guildhall members also have no right to control the actions of that firm, nor do they have the fact of ordering the telegraph to return the goods. We do not know what basis your association's letter is based on. As for the Three North Company's refusal to transport the goods on the 23rd of this month, we vaguely heard that it was caused by incorrect opening of documents. Whether this is the case or not does not require interference from our guildhall. However, your association does not examine the facts and accuses our guildhall members of destroying the national products association. Promoting national products is the common goal of everyone. Our guildhall members dare not lag behind. The National Products Introduction Center is competing for business. Accusing others of protecting private interests is too much pressure between compatriots. Furthermore, your association claims that our guildhall is obstructing the transport of national products, which our guildhall cannot admit. Even the current suspension of loading on China Merchants Bureau ships is a passive self-defense measure. In law and in reason, there is no violation. The various shipping companies are increasing the number of ships dedicated to loading goods other than those of our guildhall members, which our guildhall does not want to interfere with. How can you say we are obstructing transport? The government is fair and may not use one-sided words as the basis for a decision. Therefore, we have specially written this letter in response. We hope you will consider it carefully. This is addressed to the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, from Sanshan Funing Guildhall.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Shipping Merchants: Negotiations on Refusal to Load Goods from Jiangxi Merchants <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangxi Minbei Merchants Association stationed in Shanghai sent a letter to this newspaper stating: Respectfully, we have repeatedly seen in your newspaper that the Fujian gang Sanshan Guildhall, due to the Shanghai National Products Introduction Center selling cheaply in Fujian, believes that it is hindering their business, and refuses to load China Merchants Bureau ships. Upon investigation, the guildhall not only fears that the transport of national products to Fujian will hinder their business, but also threatens various shipping companies, refusing to load goods from the Jiangxi gang to Fujian, trying to use localism to squeeze out the business of other gangs. Various shipping companies, because the Fujian gang's goods are more numerous, have abused their power to comply with their requests, causing the Jiangxi gang's goods to Fujian to be refused loading for a long time. They are currently sending separate letters for negotiation, but there are no results yet. Therefore, we have specially copied our gang's recent correspondence with various government offices and shipping associations for disclosure, and we hope you will uphold justice, warn the shipping merchants to consider the public interest of society, and not be used by one gang, and urge the supervisory government offices to interfere with such illegal refusal of transport, for which we will be grateful. This is addressed to Shanghai Shenbao, from the Jiangxi Minbei Merchants Association stationed in Shanghai, October 31.</p>
<p>Letter to the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association: Respectfully, recently, regarding the China Merchants, Chang'an, and Sanbei companies refusing to load the goods of our gang destined for Northern Fujian, we specially wrote to request your association to investigate according to world practice and our country's current laws and regulations, uphold justice, and order the companies to load and transport as usual. It has been a long time since then, and we have not received a response, which is bewildering. Your association is the general shipping organization, and according to Article 2 of the Industrial and Commercial Association Law, it has the responsibility to correct business malpractices. The various companies are accepting or rejecting the same commercial goods destined for Fujian in China, which is obviously unfair. Not only is it legally inconsistent, but according to your association's responsibilities, you should stop it. Because the suspension of transport has been prolonged, and the losses are too great, we specially write to request your association to stop this unreasonable oppression and provide assistance. Order the shipping companies to load all goods of our gang destined for Fujian as usual. If the companies are members, and your association is unable to handle this matter, please give a clear reply so that we can seek other relief. Please do not delay the reply. This is addressed to the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, from the Jiangxi Minbei Merchants Association stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Reply from the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association: Respectfully, we have received your two letters of September 29th and October 13th, and we have listened to them carefully. Upon investigation, regarding the refusal of China Merchants, Sanbei, and Chang'an to load Fujian goods, we have sent separate letters to inquire after receiving the first letter. We have not received a reply yet. We have continued to urge a reply after receiving the second letter. Once we receive a reply, we will report it immediately. We are replying by letter first. This is addressed to the Jiangxi Minbei Merchants Association stationed in Shanghai, from Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association.</p>
<p>Document submitted to the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the Social Affairs Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government: Submitted for the Shanghai domestic shipping companies violating transportation conventions, refusing to load goods from the Jiangxi gang to Fujian, resulting in huge losses, please immediately ban them according to law and quickly order them to load and transport as usual. Upon investigation, shipping transport is a public transportation business. The transport of passengers and goods should be treated equally unless there are special circumstances such as full capacity, excessive goods, or outstanding freight charges. There should be no acceptance of this and rejection of that. However, the Shanghai China Merchants, Sanbei, and Chang'an shipping companies suddenly refused to load the yarn and other goods sold by Jiangxi merchants stationed in Shanghai to Northern Fujian in mid-September, causing the cargo transport to be interrupted and the losses to be unrecoverable. The reason for the refusal was not clearly stated, and there was no reply to repeated inquiries. We sent a letter to the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, ordering the companies to transport as usual, but they ignored it for a long time. Such independent shipping, refusing to transport goods, not only hinders transportation and damages commerce, but also violates the Three Principles of the People and industrial policy. The China Merchants Bureau has been nationalized and should not take the same steps as private enterprises. Other privately owned companies should also be supervised by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 3 of the Regulations on the Supervision of Private Public Utility Enterprises. If there is any obstruction of public transport or damage to social security, the situation should be dealt with in accordance with Article 10 of the same regulations. According to the first paragraph of Article 154 of the Civil Code, once a shipping company schedules a voyage, it is an expression of an offer and should be binding, and it has no power to refuse any merchant's consignment of goods. It is said that the companies are refusing to load the goods of the Jiangxi merchants due to the illegal donation movement of the Fujian merchants, which is not only obviously unfair, but also legally impermissible. For this reason, we petition your bureau to approve the ban and order the China Merchants, Sanbei, and Chang'an shipping companies to load and transport the goods of Jiangxi merchants stationed in Shanghai as usual in order to facilitate transportation and maintain commerce, and we are eagerly awaiting orders. We respectfully submit this to the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the Social Affairs Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Approval from the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications: We have received the submission and have separately instructed the China Merchants Bureau and the Sanbei and Chang'an shipping companies to investigate and reply. We should wait for the reply before reviewing it. Please be informed. This approval is given by Zhu Yaoting, Director of the Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e161">The Shipping Industry Association Telegraphed to Request that Private Enterprises Also Be Allowed to Participate in Joint Transport. Protecting Private Shipping Is Enshrined in the Provisional Constitution. Exclusion from Joint Transport Is Abandoning the People. <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association telegraphed to the National Government in Nanjing, the Central Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing Military Commission, and the Executive Yuan, appealing for the approval of private shipping enterprises to participate in water-land joint transport at the same time, stating: This time, in organizing the national</p>
<h3 id="e162">Water-Land Joint Transport <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways is only allowing the state-owned China Merchants Bureau to undertake it and is not allowing private shipping enterprises to participate. Members of our association, private companies, are terrified and anxious and cannot live in peace. After mutual consultation, the results of which are expressed in a joint statement: Since the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution, shipping merchants nationwide have respectfully read Article 36, which states that the state should establish state-owned shipping and provide encouragement and protection to private shipping. They know that the government has recognized shipping as an important undertaking related to the state and has therefore listed it as a special clause. They know that the government has understood that shipping cannot be operated exclusively by the state and has therefore given private shipping a place. They also know that the government has deeply realized that private shipping cannot be supported without the government's assistance and has therefore given it encouragement and protection. The merchants believe that the government is their only hope, and their inner joy cannot be expressed in words. They are only waiting for the implementation of the law. Later, the government purchased the shares of the China Merchants Bureau and changed it to state-owned, which is the implementation of the first half of Article 36 of the Provisional Constitution. The encouragement and protection of private shipping in the second half of the same article will surely be realized gradually. The joy and comfort are even deeper, and the anticipation is even more urgent. However, in an environment of no progress in protection and no implementation of encouragement, the state-owned China Merchants Bureau is exclusively allowed to</p>
<h3 id="e163">Undertake Exclusively <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The national water-land joint transport which bypasses the ship's tonnage several times that of China Merchants Bureau. Private shipping enterprises across the country are not allowed to participate together. What about encouragement? What about protection? This is simply punishing and abandoning them. There has never been a more obvious and egregious violation of the Provisional Constitution than this. They cannot help but weep for the future of the Provisional Constitution and the lifeline of private shipping. They believe that the late Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the revolution and revealed the Three Principles of the People to save the people. The spirit of starting anew with the people should be permanently invited and practiced by those who govern the country in the future. However, the revolution has not yet succeeded, and the principles are waiting to be implemented. The exclusion of joint transport from private shipping enterprises opens the door to crowding out private ownership and depriving people of their enjoyment. This is simply abandoning the people. If the people can be abandoned, then the principles can be overthrown. If the principles can be overthrown, then what is impossible? The people are the foundation of the country, and when the foundation is solid, the country is secure. Moreover, the party-state relies especially on the people's hearts. We hope that the government will consider the gains and losses. In recent years, the government has generally brought in talented people from the private sector to cooperate with the people in all its facilities, such as the public debt fund committee, the National Economic Committee, the board of directors and supervisors of the China Merchants Bureau, and the Cotton Industry Control Committee. The government has deeply realized that the name of the country is Republic and the people are the main body. Therefore, it implements the policy of sharing interests, love, and happiness with the people, in line with the last words of Sun Yat-sen and conforming to public opinion, which is what all the people in the country are celebrating together. But now, for the joint transport, they are only</p>
<h3 id="e164">Rejecting Private <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Participation, discriminating against the people, is really not as good as taking away from them. According to which principles is this justified? In countries around the world, railways and ships are divided into state-owned and private. State-owned roads are more numerous than private roads, and private ships are more numerous than state-owned ships. However, for water-land joint transport, both the road and shipping companies are freely combined. Governments have no precedent of monopolizing it, no special permission for state-owned companies to take precedence, and no restrictions on abandoning private companies. Therefore, the circulation of goods is increasing day by day, and transportation is becoming increasingly developed. Advanced models should be followed. Moreover, facts speak louder than words and are generally recognized by the world. The same is true for joint transport. Ships are the tools of joint transport and should be used widely. The Shanghai-Qingdao line, the Shanghai-Haizhou line, and the lines starting from Changsha are all connected to the railway and are important focuses of joint transport. However, the China Merchants Bureau does not have suitable ships to operate. If they want to monopolize joint transport, the obstruction of goods will be inevitable. Once goods are obstructed, industry and commerce will suffer, and the railway will be affected as well. When they realize they have been fooled, it will be too late to regret their miscalculation. These are all facts that cannot be concealed. Therefore,</p>
<h3 id="e165">For the Sake of the Railway <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The ships for joint transport must be widespread and numerous, so that contacts can be made quickly and things can be transported back and forth without interruption. There will be no long-term accumulation of goods in warehouses, the transportation will be properly distributed, and the supply and demand of vehicles will be easier to adjust. Passengers and goods can be transported at any time, so merchants will find it more convenient to trade, and the increase in railway revenue can be guaranteed. Otherwise, it is not a policy that benefits both oneself and others. Most of the goods transported by domestic ships come from the railway or go to the railway. Therefore, although the combination of water and land transport is nominally called a combination, it is actually a joint venture. In other words, the goods transported by the railway are the source of the ship's water freight. It is no different from the source of livelihood of private shipping enterprises. In recent years, the gradual increase in private ships and the prolongation of the lifeline of private shipping have all depended on this. Now, the joint military affairs are eliminating private shipping enterprises, which is simply cutting off their source of livelihood and putting them to death. Since the rise of the revolutionary army, private ships have provided more military supplies than the China Merchants Bureau. The government also pays rent to the ships of the China Merchants Bureau according to the example of private shipping ships. Therefore, China Merchants has not only failed to fully fulfill its obligations to the country, but also sometimes evaded and reluctantly fulfilled them.</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Facts Are All There <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Check and verify, the obligation and the right come into being by nature, and should be implemented relatively. Now, in military affairs that are detrimental to business, private companies are ordered to bear more obligations, while in joint transport that is related to life and death, private companies are not allowed to enjoy the same rights. Is this fair in terms of reason and logic? Moreover, the bird has not been completely exhausted, but the dog has already been cooked. Since the treatment is different, it is inevitable to wait and see. At a time when military affairs have not yet been completed, the impact is particularly profound. Moreover, according to the organization of water-land joint transport, it is actually a contribution to the recovery of shipping rights. Shipping merchants deeply sympathize. However, this matter is of great importance and should gather the entire force in order to achieve the effect of the same heart and the same virtue. Since the shipping merchants have repeatedly called for it, the Ministry of Railways has already expressed that "it will gradually need to be promoted in the future, and private shipping companies can be considered for membership based on the transportation situation." This shows that the original proposal to allow only state-owned enterprises to operate has been changed. However, because it is difficult to change suddenly, the future promotion is used as a reservation. However, shipping merchants believe that although there are verbal promises, there is no fixed date, and it will become a bubble when time passes. Moreover, everything should be planned from the beginning, and decisions should be made immediately. Since they are allowed to join, they should start cooperating to show great fairness and to achieve long-term peace. We should ask the association to telegraph to the Central Party Department of the National Government and the Executive Yuan to grant relief, order the Ministry of Railways to allow private shipping enterprises to undertake water-land joint transport at the same time as state-owned enterprises, not to distinguish between the order of time, to treat them equally, not to use the empty words of promotion, to immediately implement benefits. Otherwise, private shipping enterprises will have their source of livelihood cut off and have no way to survive on their own. The situation is urgent, and they have no choice but to close their business together in order to fulfill the plans of those who abandoned the people. Furthermore, at a time when military affairs have not been completed, private shipping enterprises and military transport are very closely related, and we also ask the association to telegraph to the Military Commission, responsible for overlooking the situation and providing assistance, so that we can carry out reconstruction and save the dying. The association replied that the provisions of the Provisional Constitution and principles, facts and reasonings, are all real, and their state of panic and fear has been witnessed by the association. Moreover, their request, which is in line with what the Ministry of Railways has already promised, differs only in one thing. If they are allowed to handle it at the same time to comfort them, it does not seem to be a very difficult matter. Since everyone is in agreement, we will deliver it on your behalf. We sincerely ask you to examine and approve it and order it to be implemented, so as to maintain the people's hearts and protect private shipping. We are extremely anxious and await orders. Yu Hede and others of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association respectfully kowtow.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association received a public letter from the Shanghai National Products Exhibition Hall, regarding the Shandong Provincial Government's approval of the Shandong Province's measures to forcefully promote the sale of national products. The Construction Department has also organized the Shandong Province National Products Promotion Committee to actively carry out the work of the Provincial National Products Exhibition Hall, requesting the collection of samples, trademarks, logos, wholesale regulations, etc. from various factories in order to promote sales. The Association considers that the Province's promotion of national products is extremely enthusiastic. Now that it has re-established mandatory promotion measures, it is an excellent opportunity to promote national products. The Exhibition Hall's solicitation of samples for display and exhibition is especially a lead for the people of Lu to recognize national products and is of great significance to the future development of national products. The Secretariat has notified the affiliated factories and members to compete for the selection of exquisite products suitable for sale in Shandong Province, attach copies of various documents, enthusiastically solicit them, and mail them directly to the Shandong Province National Products Exhibition Hall or combine them from several factories and mail them together for display and promotion.</p>

<p>The Swire Company's Xiamen dockworkers, in order to support the workers in the middle hold of the Wusong steamer and respond to the strike in Guangdong, have recently affected the cargo transported by the company's Nan Hua vessels from Shanghai to Xiamen and Shantou. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from Xiamen reporting that there was no strike. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e169">No Strike in Xiamen <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The Xiamen Swire Company dockworkers were originally scheduled to start ceasing loading and unloading work today, causing many Hakka merchants in Shanghai to dare not declare their goods for loading. Yesterday at 1 p.m., the Shanghai branch received an urgent telegram from the Xiamen branch reporting that the strike had been effectively banned by the local government. The original telegram stated, "The Xiamen authorities have informed the Seamen's Association not to strike and have ordered the Association to notify the various ports that Xiamen will definitely not have a strike," etc. Yesterday, the company translated the telegram and informed the local Xiamen Hakka merchants to load goods as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e170">No News from Shantou <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Initially, it was widely rumored that Shantou would also take the same action as Xiamen and implement a strike, but it would depend on the action of Xiamen. Now that Xiamen has been banned by the authorities and persuaded to end the strike, Shantou should also have no problem. However, as of last night, there was no telegram from Shantou. Today, the Swire Nan Hua vessels will operate as usual between Shanghai and Shantou and will carry passengers and goods.</p>

<p>In the past four or five days, after the news of the Xiamen-Shantou strike spread, the Hakka merchants of Xiamen and Shantou in Shanghai, fearing that their scattered goods would be obstructed, temporarily returned them, causing the Swire Company to suffer losses in its export business. Now that the telegram has proven that large quantities of goods and transit goods can be loaded as usual, the company will send the telegram to the branch offices in various ports to continue collecting and transporting Xiamen and Shantou goods.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Municipal Authorities Actively Planning Greater Shanghai Transportation <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The areas of Huinan and Zhabei in this city are seeing visible prosperity. Recently, in order to promote the Greater Shanghai Plan, the municipal government will first develop the downtown area. However, transportation is crucial to the prosperity of the city. Therefore, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities is actively planning transportation in the Chinese-administered areas. Here are the details we have learned:</p>
<h3 id="e173">Huinan Area <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Although there are currently trams running, operating trams is too expensive and takes too long. In fact, it will be difficult to expand them in the short term. Recently, the Huashang Tram Company has a plan to build another line from Huinan to the new western district, but this project is heavy and cannot be realized in one or two years. In the past, public buses operated in Huinan, which was very convenient for the city. However, due to the impact of the January 28th Incident, it was announced that they would be closed. However, the poor management of the Huinan public buses was also a major reason for the company's closure. Therefore, recently, the municipal government has decided to operate public buses in Huinan on its own. The route will first be tried out on the same route that the Huinan Public Bus Company used to operate. If it is successful, it will be expanded. The plan is currently being carefully discussed by the Bureau of Public Utilities, the Bureau of Finance, and other bureaus.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Zhabei Area <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>It is now known that the Shanghai Huashang Public Bus Company is operating them. The company already has vehicles running in Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Zhenru. Recently, due to the completion of the new municipal government building, a new route must be established between Zhabei and the downtown area. Although various parties have asked the municipal government to establish it, the municipal government has repeatedly consulted and decided that the Shanghai Huashang Public Bus will expand its route. In the future, the company will take the downtown area as the transportation center of Northern Shanghai. In addition to running from Zhabei to the downtown area, it will also extend north to Wusong and east to Yangshupu. The company has already ordered 12 public buses or 3.5-ton big Montian chassis from the United States, which have already arrived at the port. The bodies are being built, and all routes will be tested after being approved by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Former Secretary of the Ministry of Railways Accused of Embezzling Public Bonds – Arrested on Great Western Road – Transferred from the Special Court to the Local Court <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Hu Tianjun, a native of Anhui, 40 years old, residing at No. 14 Anle Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, served as the Chief Accountant of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Railways in 1931. Subsequently, the office was ordered to be abolished, and Hu was transferred to the position of Secretary of the Ministry of Railways. He resigned in January of this year and came to Shanghai to engage in commerce, partnering with others to open the Daxia Automobile Company at No. 271 Great Western Road in western Shanghai, with Hu serving as the manager. Recently, the Ministry of Railways suspected that Hu had embezzled public bonds worth $3,500 during his tenure as Chief Accountant and secretly ordered the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office to investigate and arrest him. As Hu resided in the Public Concession, the court prepared documents and dispatched court police Xu Guoguang and Gu Hanqing to report to the First Special District Court in the afternoon the day before, requesting assistance. The court approved the request, issued an arrest warrant, and sent it to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station, which, together with Chinese detective Liu Zheng Gang and Western detective Lawley, went to the Daxia Automobile Company, arrested Hu Tianjun, and brought him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, where court police Gu Hanqing filed the case, explaining the previous situation and requesting permission for transfer. Subsequently, police station lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that he had no objection to the transfer but requested to review the official documents from the Prosecutor's Office. Hu Tianjun stated that he served as the Chief Accountant of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Railways in 1931 and that all public bonds were kept under his seal. Later, the office was ordered to close, and he was reassigned as Secretary. He then handed over his duties and discovered that 3,500 yuan of public bonds were missing. He reported this to the person in charge of the ministry and expressed his willingness to bear the responsibility for compensation, but this has not been fulfilled to date. He also retained lawyers Da Yaoxian and Wei Wenhan to appear in court to defend him and oppose the transfer, stating that based on Hu's statements, the matter seemed to be of a civil nature, not involving criminal matters, and that his place of business was also located in the Public Concession, which the court had jurisdiction over. Even if Hu had indeed committed embezzlement, it would fall under the amnesty ordinance, and the crime he deserved would have been extinguished. Based on these three points, they requested the court to accept the case and allow Hu to be released on bail. Judge Xue Lanru reviewed the report and ordered that Hu Tianjun be allowed to be taken back by the officials from the Local Court Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. Hu's lawyers, upon hearing the order, immediately stated that they would file an appeal against this decision. The court granted the appeal.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Daily reported that Yoshikawa Kanezo (32 years old), who carried a weapon and broke into the Zhang Dental Clinic on Zhejiang Road in May of this year, robbing 600 yuan in cash, has since disappeared and lived in hiding in the French Concession. The thief repeatedly disguised himself as Chinese, wearing colored glasses, and often loitered around Hongkou, but no clues were found and it was difficult to arrest him. Until 11 a.m. on the 30th, police officer Uematsu of the Japanese Consulate General's police station suddenly saw the suspect wearing Chinese clothes and cautiously moving north on North Sichuan Road near the post office bridge. Police officer Uematsu, with the assistance of Patrol Inspector Sato Kichi, arrested him on the spot. It is reported that the Consulate General has spent more than five months searching for the suspect.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Abbot of Guoen Temple Plots to Imprison Junior Monk – Evil Plan Arose from Desire for Power – False Accusations Deceived Wang Yiting – Monk Kaijue Imprisoned in Xiqin Institute – Truth Revealed, Brother Files Grievance <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Guoen Temple on Rue de Virieu in the French Concession and Chaoyin Cave Temple on Putuo Mountain in Ningbo are both affiliated temples of the Zizhulin Temple on Putuo Mountain. The Abbot of Guoen Temple, Kaisheng, and the Abbot of Chaoyin Cave Temple, Kaijue, both became monks at Zizhulin. In terms of lineage, they are distant brothers. Kaijue is a disciple of Zhizheng, the Abbot of Zizhulin, while Kaisheng is Zhizheng's nephew. According to the regulations of Zizhulin, the abbots of Guoen Temple and Chaoyin Cave Temple must be replaced every three years, appointed by the Abbot. However, Kaisheng has been the Abbot of Guoen Temple for over ten years, possessing tens of thousands in temple property and addicted to opium. He also has a very adventurous nature. After the death of Zhizheng, the Abbot of Zizhulin, two years ago, Kaijue came to Shanghai to meet with Kaisheng and requested to switch positions between Guoen Temple and Chaoyin Cave Temple. Kaisheng did not express his opinion at the time. Soon after, Kaijue returned to the mountain, but Kaisheng actually suspected that Kaijue wanted to seize his position as Abbot of Guoen Temple. According to the regulations, he could not disobey, so he became jealous of Kaijue and hatched an evil plan to expel Kaijue. By removing Kaijue, he could personally obtain the lucrative positions of Abbot of both temples and wield all the power. Therefore, he plotted to remove Kaijue by fabricating various accusations against him and falsely informing Wang Yiting, a lay Buddhist in Shanghai, asking Wang to write a letter sending Kaijue to the Caohejing Xiqin Institute for vagrants (founded by the Shanghai Charity Organization, with Wang as the chairman), restricting his freedom. He could then safely take over the position of Abbot of Chaoyin Cave Temple. Wang did not discern the truth and readily agreed, first writing a letter to the Xiqin Institute, instructing them to receive and detain Kaijue when he was sent by Guoen Temple. Kaisheng, having made arrangements, waited for Kaijue to come to Shanghai and fall into his trap. In August of last year, when Kaijue came to Shanghai from Putuo Mountain to collect donations, he went to Guoen Temple to meet with Kaisheng. At that time, Kaisheng falsely told Kaijue, "I have a grand-disciple, Yuanlin, who is very bad, smokes opium, and commits various illegal acts, violating the precepts. I plan to send him to the Caohejing Xiqin Institute for vagrants to help him quit smoking. I have already contacted the institute and they have agreed. Because I myself am addicted, it is inconvenient for me to send him myself. Please accompany Yuanlin to the institute for me," etc. At that time, Kaijue was completely unaware of the plot and thought it was a good deed to send a grand-disciple to quit smoking, so he rashly agreed and accompanied Yuanlin to the Xiqin Institute for vagrants, where he was detained along with Yuanlin and not allowed to return. After arguing with the staff, he was told that Wang Yiting had written a letter from Guoen Temple instructing them to receive and detain both of them. At this point, Kaijue was helpless and had no choice but to submit. However, when Kaijue came to Shanghai from Putuo, he entrusted the position of Abbot of Chaoyin Cave Temple to a guest monk friend, Shuhua, for a month. When Shuhua did not see Kaijue return to the mountain after the deadline, he became suspicious. At this time, Kaisheng went to Chaoyin Cave Temple on Putuo Mountain to take over the position of Abbot and told the guest monks and others in the temple that Kaijue had committed a crime in Shanghai, was facing legal trouble, and had already died. Shuhua did not believe him and refused to allow Kaisheng to take over the position, and came to Shanghai to search for Kaijue. After spending months, he had no news until recently when he learned that Kaijue had been imprisoned by Kaisheng in the Xiqin Institute for vagrants. He was shocked and returned to Putuo, informing Kaijue's brother, Monk Jing'an, who came to Shanghai and went to the Xiqin Institute to meet with Kaijue. After learning the whole story, he contacted Kaisheng, but to no avail. Therefore, Jing'an hired lawyers Li Mian and Chen Qun to file a criminal self-accusation with the Second Special District Court, accusing Kaisheng of obstructing freedom and requesting that the case be investigated. The court accepted the case and summoned the parties yesterday afternoon. Kaijue was detained, so his brother Jing'an and lawyer Li appeared in court. The defendant claimed illness and sent lawyers Yuan Xitao and others to appear on his behalf. At 3 p.m., Judge Li Changnian heard the case in the Second Criminal Division. First, the plaintiff's representative, Jing'an, stated that Kaijue and Kaisheng were both abbots and described how Kaijue was imprisoned by Kaisheng, requesting that the defendant be strictly summoned to court for questioning and that Kaijue be brought to court for release and restoration of freedom. Next, the defendant's lawyer stated that the defendant was suffering from hemoptysis and was being treated at the Guanghua Hospital in Ningbo. He had received a letter saying that his condition was serious and requested a postponement for him to appear in court for questioning. Finally, Monk Shuhua testified. The court ordered a postponement to November 18th at 2 p.m., instructing the defendant to appear in court and requesting the Xiqin Institute for vagrants to send Kaijue to court for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Lawyer Tian Heming Sues Doctor Yu Songyun – Malpractice Causes Postpartum Woman to Contract Dysentery – Young Woman Gu Linyi Dies of Diarrhea After Childbirth <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Tian Heming, a Doctor of Law from the United States, who has a law firm at No. 170 Jiangxi Road, his wife Ms. Gu Linyi (a graduate of Shanghai Law and Politics College) previously gave birth at the Sino-German Obstetrics Hospital at No. 282 Lane, Jing'an Temple Road. Dr. Yu Songyun, the director of the hospital, because the postpartum woman had difficulty defecating, used a leather enema. Also, because the postpartum woman's breasts were swollen, he used ice packs on her breasts, causing Tian's wife Gu to develop diarrhea and eventually die. Tian believes that his wife's death was due to Dr. Yu's malpractice. Yesterday, he filed a special petition with the Shanghai First Special District Court, bringing a criminal self-accusation against Yu for killing through medical negligence. The original petition is excerpted as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e179">Ice Packs on Breasts Cause Postpartum Woman's Death <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Requesting a severe punishment for killing through medical negligence. My wife, Ms. Gu Linyi, a graduate of Shanghai Law and Politics College, entered the Sino-German Obstetrics Hospital (located at No. 282 Lane, Jing'an Temple Road) set up by the defendant at 8 a.m. on July 29th to await childbirth. The defendant, together with midwife Qiu Lizhen, delivered the baby. She gave birth at 1:34 a.m. that night (i.e., 1:34 a.m. on July 30th the next day). Afterwards, at around 11 a.m. on August 2nd, the defendant, because the postpartum woman had difficulty defecating, used a leather enema. The next day, at around 11 a.m. on August 3rd, the defendant, because the postpartum woman's breasts were swollen, used ice packs on her breasts, starting from 11 a.m. that day until 3 a.m. on August 4th the next day. At this time, the postpartum woman suddenly felt diarrhea, and only then did they stop using the ice packs (from 9:30 p.m. on August 3rd to 3 a.m. on August 4th the next day, the postpartum woman was asleep, but the ice packs continued to be placed on her breasts). My wife was healthy before childbirth, and also healthy after childbirth before the onset of diarrhea at 3 a.m. on August 4th. The defendant also called it a healthy delivery. Now, suddenly, after six days and five hours since entering the hospital, i.e., five days and one and a half hours after childbirth, she started having diarrhea, which feels quite bizarre. According to obstetrical experience, if a postpartum woman has a disease, it should occur within three days after childbirth. If there is no disease within three days, then the dangerous period for the postpartum woman has passed. In this case, my wife started having diarrhea on August 4th and continued until August 7th. Every day she had diarrhea fifty or seventy times or more. Her symptoms were thirst but no appetite, vomiting, colic, restlessness, insomnia, and the cessation of vaginal bleeding. The postpartum woman's symptoms were so severe and lasted for four or five days. The defendant failed to identify the deadly dysentery bacteria and failed to find the source of the disease, merely making empty promises and perfunctorily dealing with it. Because I saw the postpartum woman's condition worsening day by day, I moved her out of the defendant's hospital at 6 a.m. on August 8th in order to seek medical treatment from another doctor. At first, the defendant did not allow her to be discharged, and then forced me to sign a guarantee, stating that I would exempt the defendant from any responsibility. After the postpartum woman was discharged, she was sent to Tongde Hospital for treatment that afternoon. However, because her body was weak after childbirth, she should not have been attacked by any disease. Also, because the dysentery had lasted too long, her physical strength was completely exhausted. In addition, dysentery toxins spread throughout her body, and she eventually died on the afternoon of August 16th.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Reasons Listed to the Court <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>My wife's death was due to the defendant's malpractice. The reasons are listed below: (1) Postpartum women are most afraid of catching a cold. The defendant should not have allowed the postpartum woman to use ice packs while sleeping. The diarrhea occurred after the ice packs were applied, indicating that the ice packs caused the postpartum woman to catch a cold and reduced her resistance, which promoted the growth of dysentery bacteria. (2) Dysentery is an infectious disease and cannot occur without external bacteria entering the body. My wife was healthy after childbirth and only started having diarrhea after five days and one and a half hours. From a medical perspective, it is clear that it was caused by dysentery bacteria on the leather enema used on the morning of August 2nd entering her intestines. (The defendant's hospital has no disinfection equipment, and the enema is often inserted into the intestines of patients, so there are many bacteria attached). (3) The defendant used counterfeit medicine and reported a small amount as a large amount, deceiving the patient's family, which aggravated the disease, delayed treatment, and eventually led to the patient's death. (4) The postpartum woman had a high number of bowel movements when she first started having diarrhea on the morning of August 4th, indicating a severe condition. For several days from August 5th to August 7th, the defendant failed to identify the source of the disease and did not entrust others to check for dysentery bacteria, which clearly constitutes professional negligence. Based on the above facts and reasons, my wife was first infected with dysentery bacteria due to the defendant's negligence, then developed dysentery due to the defendant's negligence, and finally died due to the defendant's negligence and delay in treatment. From having no illness to becoming ill and then dying, it was all caused by the defendant. The defendant has violated the provisions of Article 27 and Article 291, paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law on the crime of homicide. Therefore, I specially request the court, in accordance with Article 338 of the Criminal Procedure Law, to severely punish the defendant according to law in order to uphold humanity and serve public convenience. Furthermore, because I have been inquiring about medical opinions from various sources, I have been delayed until now before filing the lawsuit. Also, I will submit another petition detailing the three items regarding this case: (A) detailed facts of the events, (B) medical basis, and (C) legal basis.</p>

<p>A representative of the Hagenbeck Circus stated that from today onwards, the circus program will be completely updated, increasing from sixteen scenes to twenty, making it more perfect and grand. All items in the arena have been renewed, as if it were the first time in Shanghai. Even the clown scenes have been changed. The new orchestra, composed of musician Grobe and other musicians, is more exciting than before. The most interesting new scene is the aerial performance, with the actors spinning in the air above the audience, which is truly a spectacle. In addition, there is a brand new bamboo pole equilibrium scene, with one male and one female actor each climbing to the top of a bamboo pole, while another actor on the ground uses his head and chest to support it, and the actors at the top perform various acrobatic feats in the air. This scene is very dangerous. The world's smallest and strongest "Baomi" will perform new feats of strength. "Tai Kuan" and his agile sea lions have new acts to entertain the audience. Hagenbeck and his well-trained horses, the female rider and her dancing horse, the giant elephant of "Batorai" and the Shetland ponies, the agile "Kala" brothers, the Indian elephants trained by "Walt," Hagenbeck's beautiful horses, and everything else are completely different from what was seen the first time. Ticket prices remain the same, from 60 cents for the cheapest seats to 5 yuan for the boxes. All seats from 1 yuan to 4 yuan are very comfortable and have excellent views.

<p>The Shanghai First Special District Court, as per regulations, every three months, submits a report to the department for approval to publicly burn confiscated narcotics, such as opium, morphine, red pills, and heroin, etc., in order to emphasize the prohibition of opium and eliminate the poisonous atmosphere. Now, due to the large quantity of various narcotics accumulated in the recent three months, the court president, Mr. Guo Yunguan, in accordance with the usual practice, submitted a report to the Ministry of Justice and received approval to handle the matter according to established cases. The burning was scheduled for 2 PM yesterday, and the location was still the Yizhongdi (public cemetery) of the Bao'an Hall on the south side of the court. President Guo had previously invited representatives from various municipal Party, government, military, and police organizations, the Lawyers' Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other groups, as well as the Municipal Council, to attend the site for supervision. Starting from 1 PM, court clerks were ordered to transport each item of narcotics to be burned from the evidence room to the burning site. Several prosecutors from the Higher Second Branch Procuratorate were dispatched to the site to assist with the supervision, along with investigators, prosecutors, and clerks from the First Special Court. The surrounding area of the burning site was closely guarded by bailiffs. Each type of narcotic was first unsealed and inspected by the supervising investigators and prosecutors to ensure the quality and quantity, with extraordinary attention paid to avoid any malpractices. After the narcotics were thrown into the fire, kerosene and salt were sprinkled to ensure that the ashes were also rendered useless before being thrown into the Huangpu River, effectively eradicating the root of the problem. Therefore, the work was extremely tedious, and the time spent was inevitably longer, until the twilight deepened before the matter was concluded.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Dyeing Industry Cloth Office Completed Organization Today, Declaration Issued Regarding Rejection of Dyed Goods <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the dyeing industry workers in this city, in order to demand the restoration of the original "wine money" agreement, have been on strike for ten days, and the issue remains unresolved. The industry union's cloth office, after being ordered by the Municipal Party Department to reorganize, has announced its completion and will hold a general meeting today. The office, due to this work stoppage, fears that various sectors do not understand the truth and has issued a declaration. The original text is as follows: This office's work stoppage is aimed at urging capital to restore the old agreement rights and separate the "wine money," which is the unanimous demand of all workers and staff. The request to restore the old agreement treatment, in terms of human sentiment, is the wage crystallized from the sweat and blood of each worker and staff member, which should provide for their livelihood. The capital side should show compassion for the laborers, promote mutual benefit, and uphold the principles of both law and reason. The aforementioned "wine money" old agreement was signed by the Municipal Government's Bureau of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce before 1927, as a legal agreement. In other words, it is a specific guarantee contract for the "wine money" that laborers should receive. The capital side should sincerely fulfill it, but instead, they have neglected it for a long time, disregarding the livelihoods of the labor side. Workers and staff are starving and cold, which not only worries the workers themselves but also indirectly cuts off the livelihoods of families dependent on wages. Facing starvation, they have no choice but to make a final appeal. This work stoppage is a legitimate demand for the capital side to consider the lives of the workers and is a peaceful warning. It is not a conflict or impulse between labor and capital. The workers remain calm throughout the situation. The existence of "wine money" for dyeing workers dates back to the Tongzhi era. Cloth merchants urgently needed to sell dyed cloth, so they entrusted workers to rush the dyeing and delivery. The workers, working tirelessly without adequate rest, contributed to the rapid dyeing. As a result, cloth merchants were able to seize the opportunity to sell goods, and they paid workers "wine money," which is their wage, passed down through generations. It has become an agreement through custom, and the agreement has been guaranteed by government agencies. At the same time, the cloth merchants' staff also have "flower bubbles" (bonuses), which is similar to the payment of "wine money" to the workers, and the two do not conflict. It has become an established custom and necessary benefit. Now, because cloth merchants often do not follow the dyeing price agreement signed in 1927 and the agreed unit prices for various new products in 1930, they continuously deprive and reduce costs. The "wine money," which is included in the dyeing price, is drawn into the capital side's loss-making path and disappears, leaving the laborers unable to support themselves. Workers and staff are forced to take this action. The goals of the work stoppage are: (1) to restore the original agreement treatment, urging capital to implement the rights stipulated in the legally signed agreement, while also including a supplementary condition of "three masters and one apprentice"; (2) to separate the "wine money" to protect the workers' autonomy and eliminate future labor-capital disputes. Separating the "wine money," which is included in the dyeing price, from a fundamental perspective does not involve or affect anything. Furthermore, the Qinglan Industry Union has already set a precedent for separating "wine money," which can be used as a basis. This office's advocacy is purely for the restoration of legal contract rights and the liberation of workers from suffering, with firm determination and no turning back. Fearing that various sectors do not understand the truth, the facts and difficulties are fully explained, hoping that various public organizations and labor unions will provide sympathetic assistance to resolve the crisis. This is the declaration.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Drivers' Association Schedules Enlarged Meeting <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>

<h3 id="e195">Child Unable to Speak Local Dialect, Difficult to Determine Parentage, Blood Test Needed to Verify Mother-Child Relationship, Abductors Detained Pending Further Interrogation <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Wang Jinsheng, a Chinese detective from the Huishan Police Station, previously arrested Cantonese woman Li Huangshi, 19, and man Huang Lizan at the Huishan Wharf on the Yuansheng wheel for child abduction and recovered a three-year-old boy named Bingquan. Subsequently, at 227 Taishide Road, 27 Xujiahui Road, and other places in the French Concession, two more Cantonese women, Lin Lishi, and Taixing woman Zhou Zhushi, were apprehended and taken to the First Special District Court. Interrogation revealed that the child was brought to Shanghai by Zhou Zhushi from their hometown in June and was sold to Li Huangshi as a grandson for fifty yuan through Lin Lishi's introduction. Zhou Zhushi confessed that the child's real name was Deyi and that his father, Luo Tianzhang, worked as a helper in the Wanhualou restaurant in Dongmen, Taixing. Because the family was poor, they were willing to sell the child to others as a son, and the money was taken back by his father. Li Huangshi possessed a bill of sale for the child. The case was complex, and the three women were ordered to be detained. The Taixing County government was to be notified to investigate, and the child was to be sent to the Women and Children Relief Society for care. Huang Lizan was released on bail pending further notice. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over a continued trial. After the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin recounted the events, Luo Wangshi, a woman from Taixing, claimed that the child was her youngest son. She had three sons in total. Her husband, Tianzhang, had a stall selling peanuts in Dongmen, their hometown. Because the family was poor, and she suffered from a sore on her right foot, leaving her with a limp, she could not care for the child. Therefore, she came to Shanghai with Zhou Zhushi in the summer to sell the child, receiving fifty yuan. Her remaining words were evasive, which contradicted Zhou Zhushi's previous testimony and suggested collusion in the abduction. However, because the child was young and unable to speak, it was questionable whether he was Luo Wangshi's son. When questioned, Li Huangshi stated that the child was brought by Lin Lishi and Zhou Zhushi, and his mother, Luo Wangshi, was not present at the time. Lin Wangshi testified that she knew Li Huangshi and Zhou Zhushi but only acted as a go-between and received no benefit. Zhou Zhushi's testimony was ambiguous. The court examined the bill of sale, which stated that the child was the son of the Zhang family, not the Luo family, and was signed by Zhou Zhushi. Therefore, the judge could not determine whether Luo Wangshi was the child's mother. It was ruled that they would be temporarily detained, and a blood test would be conducted to verify the mother-child relationship. Li, Lin, and Zhou were detained, while Huang Lizan remained on bail pending further verification.</p>

<p>The labor dispute at the Yihe Rubber Factory on South Minzhe Road in Shanghai was mediated by the Rubber Workers' Union of the First District, but the mediation failed. Xu Jianzhu, Cheng Dong, and Zhao Maolin were then recommended to appeal to the Party and government for relief. Zhao Erchang from the Municipal Party Department and Lin Damo from the Social Bureau were dispatched to the factory to conduct mediation. As a result of the negotiations, it was agreed that the back wages would be paid in three installments. The first installment, one-third of the total, was to be paid on November 2, after which all workers would resume work. The second installment, one-third, was to be paid on November 4, and the third installment was to be paid on November 10. It was a prerequisite that wages would not be in arrears in the future. Other demands were to be resolved by the Party and government agencies within one week.</p>

<p>Guan Sheng Yuan's Mobile Store</p>
<p>Mobile stores have been popular in Europe and America for a long time. Supplying what is available in one location to meet the needs of another is a good business practice. However, in our country, due to the road construction still being in its nascent stage, this type of mobile store has not yet appeared. The Guan Sheng Yuan Food Company in this city has always paid attention to the flow and display of goods. Recently, imitating the European and American mobile store model, they have ingeniously commissioned a store-style automobile from the United States. It has now been transported to Shanghai and assembled. The first trip was to Haining and Hangzhou for sales and exhibitions. During the National Day celebration at the city government, the vehicle was used to prepare and sell tea and snacks, which was very convenient and well-received by the viewers. According to the company's general manager, Mr. Chen, the vehicle will be used to provide tea and snacks for meetings held by various sectors at the company.</p>

<p>Hua Xin Company's New Fabrics</p>
<p>Luxurious fabrics such as wool crepe have traditionally been imported from overseas. The Hua Xin Printing and Dyeing Company in this city has recently invented a type of foreign wool fabric that surpasses imported goods in terms of its soft texture and fashionable patterns. Now that autumn is ending and winter is beginning, it is the time to switch from autumn to winter clothing. Women from all walks of life are vying to purchase it. It is reported that the factory is running extra night shifts to meet the high demand. This is also good news amid the decline of domestic silk production.</p>
<p>The Pioneer of Domestic Buttons</p>
<p>Yu Jun Qiankang, who studied chemistry and industrial arts in Japan, has a deep understanding of various emerging industries. After returning to China, he held important positions in major factories. This summer, Mr. Yu deeply felt that the clothing of Chinese people is becoming increasingly Westernized, and most of the buttons are imported, resulting in significant annual leakage of funds. To remedy this situation, he raised funds to establish the Tiancheng Button Factory in Shanghai's East Gelan Road, Haizhou Road, Zhensheng Lane. The factory uses new machines to manufacture various types of buttons, and the goods have now begun to be shipped, marking the beginning of domestic buttons.</p>

Mr. Shen has loved art since childhood and has a passion for epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting. He has collected many famous works. In the past, he studied watercolor and oil painting with the famous French painter Xu Beihong. He also felt ashamed that Chinese people did not appreciate Chinese painting, so he studied with famous Chinese painters Jiang Hanting and Zhao Shuru. He studied diligently and has become proficient. His horse paintings are particularly inspired by his teacher Zhao Shuru. Now, his works created during his spare time, such as imitations of Xinluo Shanren's screen albums, imitations of Nantian's flower paintings, and imitations of Song Dynasty horses, are exhibited at the Chinese Painting Association at the Chinese Art Exhibition. Mr. Shen is always busy with his work, and outsiders rarely see his masterpieces. Therefore, his limited works are even more precious.</p>

<p>Shangqiu is an important hub in eastern Henan and was formerly the seat of the prefecture government. Its educational undertakings should be the best in the county. However, in recent years, it has suffered many disasters, so the education in the county has been severely damaged. Mr. Chen Yansheng, a young man in the county who is enthusiastic about running education, donated 2,000 yuan after the major disaster last year to build a large bridge. Therefore, the Construction Department of Henan Province had a plaque with the words "Enthusiastic about Public Welfare." In the autumn of the Republic of China's 21st year (1932), he donated 2,000 yuan to found a complete primary school, named "Yansheng Primary School." Since its opening, the results have been outstanding. Recently, in order to seek improvement, Mr. Chen has specially accompanied Ms. Shang Kunhua, a member of the school board, and Mr. Sun Juting, the principal, to Beijing and Shanghai to visit various schools for inspiration. It is said that Mr. Chen and others have completed their visits in Beijing and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. They will visit various schools.</p>

It has sent a letter to the Military Commission to inquire about the plans of the Military Physical Education School. If the content is similar to that of the specialized physical education school, it would be better to merge it with the Military Commission for joint management.</p>

<p>The Shanghai YMCA, recognizing the backward state of swimming in our country and the urgent need for improvement, has spared no expense in installing hot water pipes in the YMCA swimming pool, in addition to vigorously promoting the sport in the fall. This allows members of the public to practice swimming in all seasons. The installation is now complete, and the water and room temperatures are comfortable. Experiments have proven it to be satisfactory. It is scheduled to officially open at 5:00 PM this afternoon. Non-members are also welcome. For the sake of popularization, there are no restrictions on gender, but the times for women will be announced separately.</p>

<p>The renowned Eagle Team, by invitation from the Youth Association Middle School Alumni Team, played a friendly match yesterday in the YMCA gymnasium on Sichuan Road. Their excellent ball skills and agile coordination made them formidable opponents for the Qingzhong Alumni Team, but their guards were slightly lacking. As a result, they lost to the Qingzhong Alumni Team with a score of 48 to 41.</p>
<h3 id="e235">World's Top Ten Tennis Players: Opinions of British Expert Meyer; Japan's Sato Ranks Third <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>(London Correspondence) The 1933 tennis season showed some recurring and confusing facts. The dominance of the United States and France in the world for thirteen years has been interrupted. In the women's world, Mrs. Moody has encountered her first failure after a long period of dominance. According to observations by British tennis expert Meyer, the top ten male and female tennis players in the world this year should be listed as follows:</p>
<p>▲Men</p>
<p>(1) Crawford (Australia) (2) Perry (England)</p>
<p>(3) Sato (Japan) (4) Austin (England)</p>
<p>(5) Vines (USA) (6) Cochet (France)</p>
<p>(7) Shields (USA) (8) Wood (USA)</p>
<p>(5) Cramm (Germany) (10) Stoefen (USA)</p>
<p>▲Women</p>
<p>(1) Mrs. Moody (USA) (2) Miss Jacobs (USA)</p>
<p>(3) Miss Round (England) (4) Mrs. Krawinkel (Germany)</p>
<p>(5) Miss Scriven (England) (6) Mrs. Mathieu (France)</p>
<p>(7) Miss Pfeiffer (USA) (8) Miss Nuthall (England)</p>
<p>(9) Mrs. Bayer (Switzerland) (10) Miss Marble (USA)</p>
<p>The biggest difference in the men's ranking is the rise of Japan's Sato to third place, probably due to his Wimbledon performance and his victory over Vines and Perry. Sato and Buichi won the finals in doubles at Wimbledon. Austin's fourth place is entirely due to his Davis Cup performance, but Vines did win the finals at Wimbledon.</p>

<p>(London Correspondence) The World Olympic Games are held every four years. Now, in addition to that, another international sports event is added, as a branch of the World Olympic Games. According to the resolution of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the first European Games will be held in Italy next year, 1934.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Every Four Years <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>This type of sports event will also be held every four years. The competition will be divided into three days. In each event, only two athletes from each country can participate, for a total of six places. Points are calculated as 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, with the first place getting six points. The country hosting the games will be responsible for providing food and lodging for the participating athletes. Four percent of the games' income will go to the International Amateur Athletic Federation.</p>

<p>It is not certain whether this resolution and method will be welcomed by the world. Britain feels most inconvenienced because it coincides with the All-British Empire Games every four years, which will inevitably be even busier. But in any case, the Empire Games will definitely be held at White City in London next year.</p>

<h3 id="e240">The Entertainment of Farmers <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>A fellow villager came, and when talking about the recent situation in the countryside, he first let out a long sigh, followed by a mouthful of complaints. He said that even things that could bring some joy were gone.</p>
<p>A few years ago, when there was a relatively good harvest, it was common to put on a few plays or hold a temple fair to relax the spirit. And each time, there would be crowds of people eager to watch the fun; it seemed that using one's own sweat to please one's own eyes and ears was more enjoyable.</p>
<p>However, the sweat and blood of the farmers should not be spent on themselves after all.</p>
<p>Temple fairs and plays were eventually interfered with. The reason for the interference, I heard at first, was to eliminate superstition. But at each temple fair or theater, there were more people than gods, and people who understood happiness better than the Buddhas. Probably in the eyes of the interferers, these people had all turned into Buddhas, so watching plays and temple fairs was close to superstition and had to be stopped!</p>
<p>Recently, a national crisis came out of nowhere, and the reason changed accordingly. Except for dances that could save the country, any kind of entertainment should be abolished. However, this "should" has now proven to apply only to remote rural areas.</p>
<p>In my hometown, there used to be dragon lantern festivals, partly to embellish the prosperous times and partly to show "sharing happiness with the people." Now, because the national crisis is in full swing, the adults and gentlemen are worried, and even the rural farmers have to wear mourning faces.</p>
<p>But not long ago, I heard that it could be relaxed again, probably if it was organized by the government or merchants. The purpose was to promote national salvation, and the tickets cost two dimes, but the plays performed were mostly stories like "Diao Liu's Killing Her Son to Avenge."</p>
<p>But business was not very prosperous.</p>
<p>After being interfered with, and then having to pay two dimes for a ticket, the farmers' lonely hearts no longer thought of entertainment.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Li Zhuowu, the Novel Critic <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>Ancient vernacular novels, from the Tang and Five Dynasties Bianwen, to the Song and Yuan Pinghua, mostly came from the hands of storytellers in the city streets, and it seems that those self-proclaimed erudite literati at that time never paid attention to them. It was not until the Ming Dynasty that many famous literati began to pay attention to novels, either creating, editing, or commenting on them. For example, the short stories "Three Words" and "Two Slaps" were edited by Feng Menglong and Ling Mengchu, and perhaps they also contained their own creations. The chapter novels "Water Margin" and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" are said to have been written by Shi Nai'an and Luo Guanzhong, who were all from the late Yuan Dynasty. "Journey to the West" was written by Wu Cheng'en, and "Jin Ping Mei" is suspected to be the work of Wang Shizhen. As for novel critics, the most famous were Li Zhuowu and Zhong Bojing in the early period, and Jin Shengtan in the later period. Mr. Zhou Zuoren, in his lecture on "The Origins of New Literature," has a very clear and concise introduction to Zhong Bojing. Jin Shengtan is known to almost every household because of his commentary on "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," which is extremely popular. Now I want to talk about Li Zhuowu.</p>
<p>The most novels attributed to Li Zhuowu's commentary are "Water Margin," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Journey to the West," as well as "Kongkong Huan," "Longtu Gong'an," and "Embroidered Couch Wild History." There is also "The Romance of Seventy-Two Dynasties and Four Books Figures," also titled "Mr. Li Zhuowu's Secret Book." Why was he so fond of novels? Speaking of him, he was truly a strange person. He passed the imperial examination and served as a proofreader and prefect. He was originally from Jinjiang, Quanzhou, and because he was friendly with Geng Ziyong of Huang'an, he resided in Huang'an after resigning from office. Later, he moved to Longtan Lake in Macheng, where he studied and lectured. One day, his head itched, so he shaved his head and became a monk. He preached tirelessly, and women also came to listen. Some said, "Women have short vision, not short learning." He said, "It is acceptable to say that people have genders, but how can it be said that vision has genders? It is acceptable to say that vision has lengths, but how can it be said that men's vision is always long and women's vision is always short? Moreover, those who come for the Dharma are not as good as men." Originally, Zhuowu was upright and solitary, intelligent and outstanding, quick-witted and eloquent, and shocked people with his unconventional ideas. His academic tenets were between Confucianism and Buddhism. He hated corrupt scholars as gentlemen and often criticized Confucius. He said: "Heaven gives birth to one person, and each person has their own use, not needing to take from Confucius to be sufficient. If one must take from Confucius, then before the millennia before Confucius, could one not be a person?" He believed that for thousands of years in the Han, Tang, and Song dynasties, there was no right or wrong, "because everyone took Confucius's right and wrong as their own, so there was never right or wrong." Since he refused to learn from Confucius and instead took Confucius's right and wrong as his own, he was naturally hated by those eight-legged essayists and corrupt scholars of the time. He was a comet with boundless brilliance in the thinking world of the time, and only one person like Wang Chong. Jiao Hong and Zhuowu were contemporaries, and he was a scholar with extensive reading who looked down on people, but he alone admired Zhuowu. He said:</p>
<p>Zhuowu is noble and pure, like Mount Tai, solemn and inviolable. Listening to his words, one feels cold and all the dust is gone. The doubts of the masses cannot overcome the belief of the wise and heroic; the uncertainty of the doubters cannot overcome the determination of the believers. Although he may not be a saint, he can bear the word "mad" and sit in the second seat of a saint.</p>
<p>Zhuowu's books were first burned in the 30th year of Wanli, at the request of Zhang Wenda. They were burned again in the fifth year of Tianqi, at the request of censor Wang Yaliang. Only the many novels attributed to his commentary escaped this violence. He was impeached and imprisoned by Zhang Wenda for being an "evil person" and died by cutting his throat. We must not forget that he was an eccentric who opposed Confucius and traditional thought, and he was not bound by traditional literature, so he was willing to put his mind to commenting on novels. However, the fact that people wanted to attribute their commentary on novels to him was not without reason. Zhou Liangong, in his "Book Shadows from the Tree House," said that there was "Ye Wentong, a famous painter from Wuxi. He read a lot, had talent and feelings, and paid attention to the learning of the two clans [Confucianism and Buddhism], so he had strange behavior... When the burning of books was prevalent in Wenling [Zhuowu], various people in the workshops borrowed the name of Wenling to sell their works, such as the First and Second Commentaries on the Four Books, Water Margin, Pipa, Baiyue, etc., all came from Wentong's hands." Perhaps the novels attributed to Li Zhuowu's commentary include those by Zhuowu himself and those falsely attributed by Ye Wentong.</p>

<p>— Translated by Mu Mutian</p>
<p>(1) Crow (Kim Yong-jak)</p>
<p>Every day when I come back from the factory,</p>
<p>On the hill by the seaside at dusk,</p>
<p>Wearing black clothes</p>
<p>A flock of many crows</p>
<p>Cries "Caw!" "Caw!"</p>
<p>Other birds</p>
<p>Have returned to their nests,</p>
<p>Only the crows gather at sunset.</p>
<p>Do they have night school?</p>
<p>Or are they holding a meeting there because of some injustice and dissatisfaction?</p>
<p>Their gathering at dusk</p>
<p>Is truly like our night school.</p>
<p>(2) The Pastor and the Swallows (Park Aji)</p>
<p>The bearded pastor in our village,</p>
<p>When children bullied the swallows,</p>
<p>Rebuked them, saying</p>
<p>"It is not allowed to bully the cute swallows."</p>
<p>Now that bearded bastard</p>
<p>No longer a pastor, is raising bees.</p>
<p>As a result, he cruelly used a pole</p>
<p>To kill the swallow that took away the bees.</p>
<p>"Why kill the cute swallows?"</p>
<p>We asked the bearded man.</p>
<p>The bearded man blushed and said nothing.</p>
<p>Strange, strange, truly strange.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Breakout (Continued) <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Zhecun</p>
<p>I clearly remember that there is indeed a story in the "Yan Family Instructions" about someone teaching their children to learn the Xianbei language and play the Pipa, but I also remember that there is a sentence underneath: "I also do not want you all to do this." It can be seen that Yan Zhitui did not encourage his children to read foreign books. Today, Mr. Feng has made a correction, and after correcting this story, he said: "Mr. Shi Zhecun is indeed combining the two typical examples of ten and Yan's family." This, I don't understand. Did I also introduce another work that should be to young people? If Mr. Feng's is based on "reading foreign books yourself is helping others learn the Xianbei language," then I have nothing to say.</p>
<p>Mr. seems to be a character who wants to defend the orthodoxy of Confucianism, otherwise why would he be so critical of Yan Zhitui's influence from Buddhism! Why would he be so dissatisfied with me reading a biography of Sakyamuni! There are two points that can be raised here: (1) Can the value of the book "Yan Family Instructions" be completely erased because of "returning to the heart"? Moreover, although Yan is advocating for Buddhism, he does not encourage leaving the world and escaping from reality. He is simply listing the points where Buddhism and can coexist without conflict, and adopting the Buddhist theory of retribution to supplement the inadequacy of Confucian moral teachings. This can also be said to be equivalent to people today quoting words from the "Bible" or "Koran." (2) My reading of a Buddhist biography is equivalent to reading a "Biography of Muhammad" or a "Biography of Christ." I have no intention of converting to Buddhism, nor do I have the intention of persuading others to study Buddhism. However, Mr. Feng's article says that it is my "way of life." How wonderful! I cannot help but take a copy of "Hundred Sutras" published by a certain Mr. Shejin on my desk and use it as a fellow believer.</p>
<p>In the past, although I had a slightly idealistic tone in my writing with Mr. Feng, I did indeed express respect. However, after seeing the article "Missing the Mark," he actually cursed me as a "gangster on the foreign field." The sound of gnashing teeth is almost audible. Although I am "evil," I dare not be so evil as to repay him with a comparable curse. I will just use a ready-made sentence: "Ten years of writing in the literary world, winning the name of gangster on the foreign field" is not worth mentioning, but I think Mr. Feng will regret it. Today, after reading "Correction of Missing the Mark," I feel that Mr. Feng's so-called "unprovoked scriptures, self-speculation, withdrawal, should, is just right for me to."</p>
<p>(Note) The two headlines on the "Great Evening News" were not added by me. I have no "position" and do not want to cause "Zhuangzi" and "Wen Xuan" to argue with each other because of me.</p>
<p>The above is a reply to Mr. Feng Zhiyu □ Complete (27th)</p>

<p>— Gao Ming</p>
<p>In the article signed "Jusheng" published in "Free Talk" on the 27th, it is said that "Opium War" was written by Tomoyoshi Murayama, not by Kan Eguchi, so I (Gao Ming) made a mistake, etc. This really confuses me. As far as I know, "Opium War" was indeed originally written by Kan Eguchi, and Tomoyoshi Murayama was at most just a reviser. I have not "consulted" the Chinese translation of "The First Flag of Europe." If the translator did not state on it that this thing was originally written by Kan Eguchi, then it only shows the translator's ignorance.</p>

<p>— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Pierre asked:</p>
<p>"So you were very familiar with him before, with this Malaisha?"</p>
<p>The father replied:</p>
<p>"Of course, he came to our house every night to play; but you must remember that on holidays, he came to school to pick you up, and after dinner he often took you back to school. Ah, that's right, he was the one who went to find the doctor the morning Jean was born! When your mother felt the pain, he happened to be eating at our house. We immediately knew that your mother was about to give birth, and he rushed to find the doctor. In his haste, he even wore my hat instead of his own. Because we often laughed about this afterwards, I still remember it. Perhaps he remembered these trivial things when he was dying: Since he had no heirs, he thought, 'Ah, I contributed greatly to the birth of this little one, I will leave my property to him.'"</p>
<p>Madam Roland sat in a reclining chair, as if immersed in memories of the past. She murmured, as if confessing her heart:</p>
<p>"Ah! He was an upright friend, a very familiar, very loyal friend, a person hard to find in this day and age."</p>
<p>Jean stood up and said:</p>
<p>"I'm going out for a walk."</p>
<p>His father was surprised and wanted to stop him, because they had something to talk about, they had to plan some things, decide some things. But they still had plenty of time to discuss things before they took possession of the inheritance.</p>
<p>So he went out, because he wanted to leave everyone and think alone. Then Pierre also said he was going out, and a few minutes later, followed his brother.</p>
<p>When only Father Roland and his woman were left together, he hugged her in his arms, kissed her ten times on each cheek, and to repay her for the criticism she often gave him, he said to her:</p>
<p>"Look, dear, it was not a loss for us to move here, recover my health, and stop staying in Paris to be beasts of burden for the children, because wealth really fell from the sky to us."</p>
<p>She looked very serious and said:</p>
<p>"This wealth really fell from the sky to Jean, but what about Pierre?"</p>
<p>"Pierre! But he is a doctor, he can earn it himself... earn some money, and his brother will definitely help him a little."</p>
<p>"No, he won't accept it. And this inheritance is for Jean, only for Jean alone. In this way, Pierre will be far less wealthy than his brother."</p>
<p>The honest man seemed to feel difficulty:</p>
<p>"Then we will leave him a little more in the will in the future."</p>
<p>"No. That's not a very fair way either."</p>
<p>He exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Ah! Then what should we do, ha! What can I do about this? You are always looking for all kinds of unpleasant thoughts. You want to spoil everything for me. Ah, I'm going to sleep. Good night. In any case, this is always a good fortune, a very good fortune!"</p>
<p>So he ran off to sleep happily, without caring about anything, without a word of regret for the friend who had died so generously.</p>
<p>Madam Roland began to meditate again in front of the burnt-out oil lamp.</p>

<h3 id="e246">Random News from Abroad: Gold Market Unstable; Silver Prices, Exchange Rates, and US Dollars Disappointingly Increase; Stocks, US Cotton, and US Wheat Decline Instead; Result: Rebound to 4.70 Yuan <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Although the gold market was stable yesterday, it experienced many fluctuations. The overall market situation is stable, and the range of fluctuations is narrow. Initially, the overseas silver market in the UK and the US both rose. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange only increased by 0.32 to 0.4%, which is much less than the initial increase. Although the exchange rate rose, it was not by much. The price of raw gold in London rose by 2 shillings and 6.5 pence. The US government purchased newly mined gold at a price of $31.96, only an increase of $0.14 compared to before, which was very disappointing. In addition, stocks fell by $3.58, US cotton also fell slightly, and US wheat saw mixed increases and decreases. As a result, people's hearts stabilized. The gross price opened at 78 yuan, but many took the opportunity to sell at a high price, so although it rose, it still declined. After the opening, the market was flat for the first ten sessions. Then, the central bank sold US currency, which hardened the foreign exchange market, and Reuters reported that both the UK and the US would buy cash, which once broke 70 yuan. Unexpectedly, with the support of those buying at lower prices, there was also news that the US had not made concessions on war debts, and the exchange rate showed signs of stabilizing. In an instant, it rebounded nearly 10 yuan. In the afternoon market, the banks tended to be tight, and although the market was stable, there was a lot of struggle. Banks were still buying on the cheap, which led to the rebound after the decline. The overall market situation remained uncertain. It was observed that the fluctuations throughout the day were less than 10 yuan, with only slight disturbances. Overseas news was chaotic but lacked a significant impact. The result was a rebound compared to the previous day, which was reasonable. The Hadj price was 1,125 yuan. A record of the market situation throughout the day is provided below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 776 yuan, an increase of 6.70 yuan compared to the previous close. Commodities opened at 5.70 yuan. The exchange market opened with the near-term selling price for the British currency at 1 shilling and 3 pence and 0.4375. The US currency was 30.75 yuan. Heng Yu, Yuan Mao, Yongfu Yu, Qian Changxiang, Tong Yi, etc. all sold, gradually retreating to 4 yuan. Richang, Hengyu, Ruixing, and others all took advantage of the low prices to buy. HSBC announced that it expected the British currency to rise by 0.125 and the US currency by 0.375, but it still rose to 6.30 yuan. Hua Bi sold US dollars for January at 1.875 and for February at 0.375. Fuyu, Yifeng, Yongrui, Kangyuan, Fengyong, Tongtaichang, Yuanxing, and Yonghengxing all sold contracts. The central bank sold US dollars for January at 0.25, and Hua Bi sold again at 0.3125, but retreated to 2.20 yuan. Ruixing and Zhaofengchang took advantage of the low prices to buy, and there was quite a struggle at this time. It was reported that Zhongfu had offered US dollars for January at 0.375. Subsequently, Zhengchang, Yuansheng, Yongruixing, Daxing, Yonghongxing, Yongdeng and others made purchases, rising to over 5 yuan. Pangensai offered US dollars for January at 0.25, and Datong offered February at 0.50 yuan, and there was a decline, gradually due to the slight tightening of the domestic market. Yifengyong also entered, almost rising to the vicinity of 6 yuan. The central bank still sold US dollars for February at 0.375, and commodities Heng Yu offered contracts and declined. Zhifengyong, Yuansheng, Daxingyong, Hengtaity, Tianfengyong, and Dafayong continuously sold commodities, breaking 70 yuan and falling to 68.5 yuan. Bingxing and Hengyu took advantage of the low price to buy in, rebounding by 1.5 yuan, but because US dollars for February at 0.625 were difficult to sell, Dadesheng and Zhaofengchang sold to 67.7 yuan. It is known that after this, overseas news turned from bad to good. Fuchang, Bingxing, Daxingyong, Fuyu Qianchang, Wanxing, Dadesheng, Tongyi, and others competed to buy, and rebounded to 75.5 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the last day of October's special big settlement period, the complexity of settlement procedures for the silver and money industry was unprecedented. The majority of long-term contracts were settled, and various settlement items were so numerous that they were unmanageable. It was appropriate that the affairs were complicated and the sorting took time. It was certainly not like the short time that is estimated during normal times. As for the head lining, it was still very loose and excessive, so the market interest rate in the black market was lower than the previous day by 0.02, calculated at 0.06. The early and noon were the same, and the head scratch was actually a blank scratch, and the funds coming in and out were very loose. The transaction of discount notes in the morning market was more than 5.1 million transferred, more than 400,000 new transactions, more than 100,000 transactions in the noon market, more than 700,000 transactions in the small general association, and more than 3 million in foreign pledges and settlements. The amount of futures settlement was also more than 10 million. All settlement procedures for Chinese and foreign banks are too excessive, and it is not easy to record at a time, so it is omitted. The settlement of foreign official bills of exchange in money shops is also due to the excessive amount, and the total account must be settled at midnight, so at the time of drafting, it was also impossible to verify. The issue of bank notes into and out of the Huaihe area totaled more than 1.4 million collected, more than 1.7 million issued, and a net difference of 350,000. Customs duties collected more than 1.2 million. The settlement and settlement also had several million. The situation was unusually busy, it is said. In addition, the total amount exchanged by the bill exchange in this city was 16,022,912.96 silver dollars, including 7,008,752.52 silver dollars and 9,014,160.44 silver dollars.</p>

The transaction volume was 40,937 strings, totaling 13,400 yuan in loan payments.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the final settlement period for this term's long-term contracts. All procedures for entry, exit, deposit, and arrears were completed. According to reports from industry insiders, the estimated amount of transfers for this term was more than 31 million. New transactions were 7 to 8 million, and recoveries were 5 to 6 million. Deposit transfers amounted to more than 10 million. The amount that should be recovered but could not be repaid, and seemed to have become bad debts, totaled more than 3 million. This shows a glimpse of the market's decline. As for interest rates, those with deposit interest rates of 5 yuan accounted for 70 to 80 percent, while 10 to 20 percent had interest rates increased by 0.5 yuan on the domestic market. The lowest interest rate was from 7.5 yuan, and the highest price in this city was up to 11 yuan. Some foreign markets even did 13 to 14 yuan, plus the Hankou gang doing 14 yuan.</p>

<p>The daily interbank rate in October fluctuated between 0.06 and 0.07 and 0.1, never exceeding the range of 0.1. As a result, the total amount for the whole month, although it increased by several cents compared to September, was still only 2.21 yuan. Calculated on the 30th, each day accounted for 0.074, because there were two days closed for the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Double Ten Festival this month, so the whole day only had 29 market days. It is expected that the amount of deposit interest may increase by 0.5 yuan, but it is not known whether it will increase.</p>

<h3 id="e253">December Futures Debut; Bond Market Holds a Steady Attitude <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of trading for December futures on the Chinese Business Securities Exchange. Except for the 1918 Customs Gold Short Gold and Long Gold, which had not yet opened, all other bonds opened gradually in the morning. The market did not experience much change. Although Finance Minister Song's chaotic dismissal had been approved, its impact on the public bond market had already reverberated in the previous few days. Now that a successor has been found, the public bond fund has not been affected in the slightest. This has been mentioned by reporters early on. Those shorting cannot avoid being alarmed unnecessarily. At the opening, many people thought it would definitely be small, and retail investors sold, which was still not small. The 1918 Customs slightly improved by 0.2 jiao, while the rest gradually weakened, and later saw a decline of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.5 jiao. However, various far-term contracts had been opened, and the market price was relatively strong, because there were some purchases of No. 47. In the secondary market, No. 4, No. 46, and No. 47, etc., all had purchases, and the market price rebounded, and the trend was quite stable, with a consistent rebound of 0.2, 0.3, and more than 0.4 jiao, which shows that those who respect and know the retreat. A certain major investor also stopped selling. At the opening of the afternoon market, the previous listing No. 38 sold slightly at 0.2 or 0.3 jiao, and the soldiers gradually stabilized. Later, No. 47 still had purchases, and continued to rise by 0.2 and 0.3 jiao. Before the close, the previous listings continued to improve by 0.1 and 0.2 jiao. After entering the market, the unified tax and salt slightly rebounded by 0.1 to 0.3 jiao. In summary, the result of the market price was a slight rebound of 0.1, 0.2 to 0.5 yuan. The trend is due to the exchange of old and new finance ministers, and it is not known whether there will be a way to handle finances in the future, but with someone responsible, it should not affect public bonds. Therefore, the bond market may not be small for the time being. The supply and demand of chips is also due to too many short positions, and whether there is still surplus power, otherwise the rebound will be very fast. The total transaction volume was 21,245,000 yuan. There were no spot transactions. Futures unified salt tax totaled 9,540,000, downsizing accounted for 3,600,000, and 1919 Customs accounted for 1,735,000, 20 rolls and 20 customs totaled 3,975,000, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 400,000 or 500,000.</p>

<p>Xinfengbanhang reported that the New York stock market on the 30th fell because bankers found it difficult to understand the government's monetary policy, coupled with unfounded rumors that France would ban gold exports, and large bulls took profits. The future of the stock market seems not to be stable for the time being. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 1,470,000 shares. "Wheat" The government is still buying spot goods in various markets, and forward prices are rising, but they are encountering resistance from profit-taking by bulls. The supply of spot goods has been greatly reduced, and the low wheat price is still beneficial to buyers. "Cotton" The market situation is loose, due to the profit-taking of December bulls and private forecasts of increased cotton production. The result is still uncertain, because the actions of other markets are still focused on the government's gold policy. Those who advocate currency inflation are now taking advantage of the low cotton prices to promote it. "Silver" The opening was firm, and the close was weak, due to purchases by China. The gold price of the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation was $31.96 per tael, up $0.14. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The cotton market started with increases and then continued to decline, but the situation is slightly weak, because US cotton is trending down and the gold market is falling, which has softened people's hearts. However, most cotton merchants are in a bullish position and refuse to relax, so the market situation is extremely complicated, and the future situation lacks certainty.</p>

<p>(Article 1) Cotton delivery shall be requested for inspection by the delivering broker at any time after the 10th of each month (weighing must be carried out after the 20th) and no later than two days before the monthly delivery. (Article 2) The order of inspection shall be carried out according to the order of request. (Article 3) When the cotton is inspected, if the pattern matches the standard, each 100 dan, such as Renji cloth bags, is about 85 bags per lot. Hanyang cotton has 4 tubes, each tube weighing about 1 pound (and so on). If it is a machine-baled large package of about 4 dan, there are about 25 to 27 bags per lot, totaling 100 dan. Two bags must be opened for sampling, and two tubes of cotton samples weighing about 2 pounds must be taken. If a lot has two brands, open two more bags and take two more tubes to separately inspect the amount of moisture. (Article 5) The moisture content of cotton shall be 12% as the standard. If it is 13%, the price must be reduced by 1%. If it exceeds 13%, it is unqualified. (Article 6) Cotton delivered, regardless of the type of packaging, can be delivered. (Article 8) Cotton that fails the inspection shall be replaced by the deliverer as soon as possible, and the replaced goods shall be delivered no later than one day before delivery. If the inspection still fails, and delivery cannot be made the next day, it shall be deemed a breach of contract. (Article 10) The validity period of the cotton inspection certificate is limited to 7 days after the monthly delivery is completed. (Article 12) If the delivering broker considers the cotton to be unsuitable after inspection, he may submit reasons to request re-inspection. The re-inspection fee is 70 yuan per 100 dan, 105 yuan within 5 times, and 140 yuan within 10 times, which shall be paid in advance by the requester. If the judgment result confirms that the inspection was inappropriate, it shall be refunded by the exchange. (Article 16) If the cotton passes the inspection but is not delivered, a water inspection fee of 0.03 silver yuan per dan shall be charged, and a weighing fee of 0.03 silver yuan shall be paid (weighing labor is calculated separately). (Article 17) Cotton delivery shall be in units of 100 dan, and the remainder shall be omitted.</p>

<h3 id="e263">Customer Xiang Rice Sales Active, Trend Falling —Citywide Rice Inventory of 150,000 Bags— <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the customer Xiang rice market had relatively active sales. The Fuzhou gang continued to handle it smoothly, and Quanzhou also inquired about it. The Guangzhou gang handled the stomach and was also active. The market was very prosperous. However, there was too much stock in the market, and it was also prosperous to the end. At present, the Nanjing train cargo plane of rough rice in the Shanghai area has a total of more than 100,000. Hunan rice also has more than 40,000 bags. In addition, other scattered small numbers total a huge 150,000 bags. With more stock and less sales, the market is soft and tending to fall, down another 0.03 to 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day. It is calculated that 900 bags of Shashi rough rice were sold at a price of 5.35 yuan, which was handled by the Guangzhou gang. The Fuzhou went to Hunan aircraft, 850 bags of Jing at a price of 5.72 yuan. 300 bags of Jiangxi rough early rice were sold at a price of 5.35 yuan, and 123 bags of aircraft late rice were sold at a price of 7.50 yuan. In addition, 200 bags of Nanjing factory You were transported to Quanzhou at a price of 6.70 yuan. The middle and second were reduced according to the price. In the future market, due to the arrival of too much stock, they are still looking to soften.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Continuously Falling Rice Market in Heshang <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Southern Shanghai: Yesterday's sources brought in over thirty boats, approximately three thousand shi (石, a unit of dry measure), while stockpiles in the docks increased due to slow sales in recent days, estimated to be six to seven thousand shi on the way. Although yesterday's sales were broader than before, reaching five to six thousand shi, confidence remained low, and the market was generally sluggish. Prices for various new japonica rice and high-grade paddy rice varieties fell slightly. Doyangjian rice also saw a minor price adjustment. However, kiln rice, Six Zhong rice, Baige rice, etc., were still in strong demand, keeping the market relatively stable and in a balanced state. Broken japonica rice remained stable due to scarcity. New Yinyuan rice arrived in large quantities, and the market price continued to fall by one or two jiao (角, a unit of currency) or more.</p>
<p>Northern Shanghai: Yesterday, fifty-six or fifty-seven boats arrived from various routes in Heshang, with sales remaining good. New japonica rice, Baiyuan rice, and Yangbudujian rice prices saw a slight increase. Kiln rice, Baige rice, and Yinyuan rice prices decreased by two jiao. Kejian rice was also slightly weaker. Broken japonica rice remained stable.</p>
<h3 id="e265">October Flour Delivery Volume - 219,000 Packages <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the October flour delivery day. The delivery volume was quite active, with a total of 219,000 packages, including 7,000 packages of Green Fort, 9,000 packages of Green Danfeng, 8,000 packages of Green Maigen, 1,000 packages of Green Samsung, and 194,000 packages of Green Battleship. It is said that these warehouse receipts were mostly hedging goods from a few months ago. Due to a large outflow of goods from a certain factory, they had to be repurchased. Because hedging was not profitable, they had to be abandoned. Therefore, the majority belonged to manufacturers, with merchants accounting for only thirty to forty thousand packages.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Soybean Price Continues to Fall by Three to Four Fen <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>The soybean market situation saw a slight increase in supply from distant merchants due to previously high prices. Sales saw movement from other merchants besides factory owners, who were adopting a wait-and-see attitude. However, sentiment was bearish, and prices continued to decline by three to four fen (分, a unit of currency). Yesterday, large-grain soybeans from Xuzhou opened at four yuan and twenty-nine jiao (元, a unit of currency), with approximately two hundred packages traded. The remaining Chelin goods were offered around one thousand seven to eight hundred packages, purchased by exporters in this area and inland.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3 id="e267">Coarse Granulated Sugar and White Sugar Drop Another Jiao <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was weak, and trading volume remained low. The association priced No. 24 coarse granulated sugar at twenty-one yuan, a drop of one jiao compared to the previous day, with only fifty packages traded. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was quoted at twenty yuan and fifty jiao but remained untraded. Dutch Red NT Mark was priced at sixteen yuan and two jiao, and BDA Mark at sixteen yuan and one jiao, both down by five fen compared to the previous day. Taikoo Sugar B Mark was at twenty-one yuan and two jiao. China Guohua Zhenji No. 1 Mianbai sugar (fine white sugar) was originally priced at nineteen yuan and eight jiao, with some transactions. Chaoqing sugar was offered for only a few dozen packages at fifteen yuan and seven jiao. It was observed that high-grade sugar inventory was scarce, with only one merchant holding stock, attempting to support the price.</p>

<h3 id="e268">Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Rises Another Two Yuan <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Sichuan pickled mustard tuber recently faced supply disruptions, leading a certain firm to actively buy in, causing the price to rise gradually. Previously, wholesale prices had reached thirty yuan. Due to increasingly thin inventory, the trend tightened further. Yesterday, it was reported that wholesale prices had risen another two yuan, with merchants also increasing prices accordingly.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3 id="e269">New White Tung Oil from Various Production Areas Being Sold Off <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>The price of white tung oil in foreign trade fluctuated irregularly, causing the market to fluctuate as well. Last week, the selling price in Hankou for foreign oil merchants had increased to twenty-five yuan and twenty-two jiao per dan (担, a unit of weight), then fell back to twenty-four yuan and fifty-six jiao. The day before yesterday, it rose again to over twenty-five yuan, with sales of tender-colored oil at twenty-five tons for twenty-five yuan and seventy jiao, and forty tons of ordinary oil at twenty-five yuan and three jiao, all on foreign trade gross terms. Hankou merchants bought in Xiang Tung oil at twenty yuan and six fen per dan for five hundred dan, and branch barrels at twenty yuan and three fen per dan for one thousand dan, both including tax on merchant terms. Traders estimated that tender-colored oil for internal sales in Tianjin would require twenty-two yuan, and ordinary oil from old stock would require twenty yuan and one or two jiao. The market situation fluctuated repeatedly and would still depend on the prosperity of foreign firms. However, new goods from production areas were already being sampled. It was reported that Changde was selling off forward contracts for new oil in the coming month, priced at only eighteen yuan and seven jiao, equivalent to between twenty-four yuan and forty-five jiao in Hankou for foreign firms. After this news spread, Hankou foreign firms were unwilling to increase their purchases. Therefore, although there was a slight improvement in recent days, there were concerns that changes would occur when the new goods arrived. Zhejiang Tung Oil merchants had sold Xizhu new oil for twenty yuan per dan, slightly cheaper than recent prices, but transacted at nineteen yuan and six jiao. Before the new goods arrive, this price might be sustainable. However, new oil falling to below twenty yuan was unprecedented in recent years. The low price might stimulate sales, but it might be difficult to lower prices further.</p>

<h3 id="e270">Half a Buddhist Scripture Pacifies the World <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>Buddhism prohibits killing, supposedly out of a reluctance to sacrifice the lives of livestock to satisfy one's gluttony. Extending this compassion to livestock, although showing no pity for plants, which also possess "life," and unhesitatingly cooking and consuming them, the difference between fifty steps and a hundred steps means we cannot worship the greatness of those who only escaped fifty steps. Therefore, although Buddhism's prohibition of killing does not extend to plants, which also have life, we must admire the spirit of Buddhists who do not eat animal meat, which is ultimately superior to those who cannot even do this and adhere to the "survival of the fittest" theory.</p>
<p>The core of Chinese culture lies in "compassion." Although Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism stand as a tripod, they all retain "the heart of compassion." To quote a phrase, it could be said to be "the way of benevolent governance." This is naturally the "magnanimity of a great nation" that a "land of propriety and deference" should possess, and it is also a powerful underlying factor preventing the Chinese nation from being eliminated by foreign races. During the Five Barbarians Rebellion, the Huns and Tatars who ruled over China ultimately had to return power to the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, which is a good example. Moreover, all those who ruled over China and enslaved the descendants of the Yellow Emperor eventually could not escape being assimilated by the Chinese nation, fulfilling the Buddhist "law of karma," because intending to enslave and destroy another nation is acting against the way of heaven, planting a "bad cause," which leads to the "bad effect" of being assimilated. Therefore, although India and Korea have been conquered, if the end of the world does not come, there will surely be a day when they will restore their lands.</p>
<p>Entrusting all great matters to Heaven" is not only the most important page of life philosophy, but also the essence of political philosophy. Napoleon, Louis XIII, and Wilhelm II, shouting and scolding, clearly never studied the great principles of "non-birth and non-death" and "non-contention with the world." In modern times, figures like Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, and Araki, how could any of them understand "the cycle of retribution" and "the manifestation of heavenly principles"? Only those who have no "ambition to expand territory" and "are indifferent to gains and losses" can endure some "immediate losses" without fear and sit back to collect "debts in the next life."</p>
<p>Half of the Analects can govern the world, but this "world" only refers to the "world" within the four seas. Only half of a Buddhist scripture can pacify the "world" beyond the four seas and turn weapons into silk. Therefore, not only did Commander Wu Yu and Commander Sun put down their butcher knives, read scriptures, and convert to Buddhism, but famous figures in Europe and America also crossed the ocean to China to take vows at Mount Baohua and become Buddhist disciples. It seems that those who will pacify the world in the future will not be anything other than half a Buddhist scripture.</p>
<h3 id="e271">The Groans of Peasants in Bandit Areas <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Si</p>
<p>Shanghai is promoting the use of domestic goods by the public, designating this year as "National Products Year." Meanwhile, in XX Province, the unexterminated bandits and communists are harming the local people. The military and civilians of that province are united in heart and mind, designating this year as "Bandit Extermination Year," to show their determination not to coexist with the bandits! However, the bandit forces are still rampant, and the people are still suffering. Yesterday, I met a friend from XX Province who brought me a lot of news about XX Province. I am now recording the essentials of what he told me to represent the groans of the peasants in the bandit areas.</p>
<p>Fields with no hope of autumn harvest always present a bleak, withered, and yellow face. The villagers are not as busy as in previous autumns, only wandering around, looking here and there, or returning to what they call "houses," which are bare and empty. The children, with gaunt faces, say to their fathers, "I'm hungry!" and to their mothers, "I'm cold!" But their parents, besides sighs, no longer say excitedly as before, "The gold in the fields is our clothing! It's our white rice!" With no harvest in the fields, what about the "National Salvation Donation" and the "Bandit Extermination Military Donation"? These good-sounding names are still the obligations of the farmers.</p>
<p>The law-abiding farmers, besides closing their eyes and starving to death alive in their "houses," have no other evil thoughts. Sometimes, one also sees members of the relief committee sticking their heads out of car windows to look outside. They have even used the mouths that have eaten shark fin soup at fifty yuan a meal and the lips that have smoked cigars at one yuan each to say, "Relief! Relief!" But when the green smoke of the cigars drifts out in wisps, the echoes of "Relief! Relief!" also come to an end. The stubborn farmers, deluded by the noble name of "not willing to starve to death," then take the risk of joining the bandits' ranks. Although they know this thing is unwanted, for the sake of living, they can't worry about so much.</p>
<p>The peasants in the bandit areas have all abandoned their homes, which are devoid of possessions, to live a life of fleeing with wives and scattering children. The wife experiences cold wind and dew, and a dismal moon hangs high. The deserted village, besides the barking of the few chickens and dogs left behind by the owners, has no other sound. The withered crops in the fields appear exceptionally desolate under the moonlight. The autumn insects chirping are no longer appreciated by anyone, and no one will compose a second "Autumn Sounds Rhapsody."</p>
<h3 id="e272">Bending and Stretching <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Liwen</p>
<p>Being able to bend and stretch is the way to not be a complete man, as the ancients all say. A person must listen in all directions and see in all places. Even if someone bullies you, you must first see what kind of person the other party is. If it is someone as skinny as dry noodles, then you can be honest and rude, using your old fist to vent your anger. If you unfortunately encounter a shrewd ghost, then you must act according to the situation, because if you are reckless, you are bound to suffer.</p>
<p>Only bending and not stretching, that kind of person has no prospects. Only stretching and not bending, that kind of person is also an impetuous brave man. Having no prospects, then there is only the qualification to be a slave. The bravery of an impetuous man does not have a good result. However, retreating step by step, leading to the disaster of losing one's life, that is not as good as only stretching and not bending! What is sad is that the people of the country do not see this and still resolutely consider themselves able to act according to the situation. What more can be said! What more can be said!</p>

<p>In the countryside, as I tread the fine, even, and soft soil of the village, serenity and warmth are the hallmarks here. Under the boundless and crystalline sky, the clouds drift so leisurely, skimming over the eyebrow-like distant mountains, skimming over the red forests, skimming over the masts of the fishing boats flying small white flags...</p>
<p>Yellow wild chrysanthemums dot the quiet tombs along the road. Silver-colored lambs scatter about in the vast, desolate gardens, all looking so leisurely. Old yellow oxen lie in the haystacks, their mouths constantly grinding. Occasionally, a long moo from these clumsy creatures startles the small sparrows foraging for rice grains in the fields, causing them to fly together into the treetops...</p>
<p>Innocent and charming village children stand in twos and threes by the fences, singing their practiced local tunes, which are so moving! City people always cast curious glances whenever they pass by... "Look! Another person in a long gown is here!" they shout!</p>
<p>The golden haystacks in the fields are already piled high. Honest and simple old farmers puff diligently on their dry tobacco pipes as they work hard. Dry laughter sometimes emanates from them. Exchanging labor for harvest is their only source of joy...</p>
<p>Low thatched huts are embedded where the sky and earth meet, and wisps of smoke are faintly visible, seemingly upside down on the rooftops, lingering for a long time... Small white flags flutter from the treetops, the signs of village inns and teahouses... The scenery is so elegant and pleasant, with a beauty of serenity, an oriental charm, like a painting in Wang Wei's poems...</p>
<p>Many village women with blue cloth headscarves come and go in the fields, all deeply silent, bathed in the sea of autumn light. On each healthy-colored face, the joy of harvest is expressed! The women of the city are daughters of materialism, but they are daughters of nature.</p>
<p>By the small stream, village girls are pounding clothes on blue stones again. Vines clinging to the bridge railings flutter in their beautiful hair. The rushing stream crashes on the blue stones, producing the autumn melody of a zither. A small fish jumps out of the water with a "dong!" sound. Fine and lustrous silver scales reflect the autumn sunlight, flashing quickly before their eyes, making them think of the fishing nets they have woven themselves at home, which is so satisfying!</p>
<p>In the countryside, as I tread the fine, even, and soft soil of the village, serenity and warmth are the characteristics here!</p>

<p>Society member Jiang Junyinqiu recently collaborated with three Wu-style calligraphers from Wu Xia, Wu Qingwang, Yu Jue, and Wu Jinxian, on a four-panel screen painting. Wu Qingwang's Zhen script is full, mellow, rounded, and pleasing. Yu Jue's cursive script demonstrates unrestrained brushwork, already renowned in the art world. Jinxian, although a rising star, excels in all four styles, with a particular focus on Han-style clerical script, striving to emulate Yuan Shou's style. Yinqiu, a writer from Zengsheng Society, specializes in seal script, with silver hooks and iron strokes, and a transcendent ancient flavor. Now, these four gentlemen have the elegant inclination to collaborate, and the affordable commission is offered to the public. Screen paintings measuring three to four feet per panel are priced at only five or six yuan, and five to six feet at only seven or eight yuan. This is a literary game, using it to form a connection through calligraphy. — Jian</p>

<p>Chapter 18: Sending Tea with Pulsing Armpits Comforts the Husband; Hastily Leaving the Border, Forcing a Smile to Bid Farewell to Family</p>
<p>Some say that patriotism is a kind of superstition. As long as this idea of patriotism is instilled into the minds of the people, that person can completely sacrifice their life and property for the sake of patriotism. If people in the world had no such patriotic ideas, there would be no military wars or economic wars, and people would be much happier. In fact, this kind of patriotic superstition is not easily transmitted. Like Zhao Weng, he usually promotes patriotic ideas very much. But when his son is about to lead troops to the front line to fight for the country, he will feel twenty-four minutes of unease in his heart, feeling that the artillery fire is a merciless thing. His son is serving as a company commander, which is like the brothers going to the front line together, and there is no safe zone where they can dig to protect themselves. Therefore, although he feels uncomfortable in his heart, he still encourages his son in his mouth to contribute to the country. When he heard clearly that his son was going to Xifengkou to block the pass, which was far away from the Japanese army, his spirit suddenly perked up, and he kept shouting for Old Lady Yang in the outer courtyard. Jiang suddenly heard Zhao Weng shouting like this, and she was a little confused in her heart, so she immediately answered and walked to the backyard. Zhao Weng waited for her to enter the door, clapped his hands and said, "Now I understand, we don't have to worry so much. Ziqiang is not going out of Shanhaiguan, just to Xifengkou. This place is far away from the fighting place. To be honest, being stationed there is almost the same as being in the Xiyuan camp, it doesn't matter at all." (228)</p>

<p>— Xingbi</p>
<p>In our impression, above everything, a fiery, red-hot umbrella completely unfolds, roasting all living and non-living things alike, making them feel the same feverish heat!</p>
<p>Non-living things indeed have no way to resist; they can only endure this brutal threat, hardly daring to move at all.</p>
<p>Living birds and beasts, embracing a policy of non-resistance, can only shout and scream wildly, flying and running around, busy without end, each searching for shady places.</p>
<p>Humans are the spirits of all things. For the sake of livelihood, how can they shrink back and not strive and struggle?</p>
<p>In an instant, the future scene will make our eyes and bodies feel something absolutely opposite to the past. In this bleak scene, we can hear sounds like dragons roaring and tigers howling, and we suddenly feel that the clothes on our bodies are exceptionally thin. Sometimes, we even need to use the heat of fire to help us resist the invading cold!</p>
<p>Everything outside—flying—walking—is not easily encountered casually.</p>
<p>What lies before us—green—green—lofty—lush—covering a portion of the earth, we are afraid that we can only see a few dry, bald tree trunks. But on those branches, perhaps we can find a few yellow leaves that are about to fall but haven't yet!</p>
<p>Pine, bamboo, and plum are not afraid of the ravages of frost and snow, but instead show off their outstanding appearance triumphantly, surviving!</p>
<p>Silver snowflakes pile up on everything, reflecting a pure and bright world.</p>
<p>Small rivers and shallow ponds have actually turned from liquid to that glassy solid. Then, on the eaves, many transparent crystals are found, hanging there long and short!</p>
<p>In the middle of the past and the future is the present. This present, we must know, what kind of climate, what kind of situation is it?</p>
<p>The food in the bowls and cups has a smoke-like quality, rising up and lingering in the air. The clothes on our bodies are darker in color and thicker in texture!</p>
<p>A red—round—radiant sun gradually emerges from the fish-belly-colored morning light. Grasslands like green felt and leaves like green velvet have long been moistened by the clean, nourishing dew.</p>
<p>Farmers, barefoot and bent over, work in the green fields. There are also fishermen wearing mist and carrying bamboo hats, casting their fishing rods and nets on the autumn waters of the stream, watching intently—waiting—hoping—for the float to sink and the net to be submerged, not caring that the mist and bamboo hats on their bodies are as if they have gone through a fine rain!</p>
<p>The singing birds in the forest, the chirping cicadas among the trees, and the crickets chirping in the four walls, all, one after another, sing triumphant songs at this time, chanting timely melodies, as if they are sincerely advising us, saying: "Time is no more, the present is different again, each should be diligent and work hard!"</p>
<p>A bright mirror, sometimes full and sometimes waning, hangs high in the sky, making us feel that all things in the universe are exceptionally clear and bright. The golden osmanthus and the five-colored chrysanthemums by the bamboo fence are illuminated by it, becoming particularly beautiful. But these beautiful flowers will soon be attacked by the merciless—wind—frost—rain—snow—causing them to show a very sad appearance!</p>
<p>Recalling the impressions of the past, imagining the future, and experiencing the present, what we hear and see cannot help but move us within!</p>
<p>Alas! The changes of people and society are like the transformation of the climate. How many people can, like the delicate lotus and the cold-resistant pine, bamboo, and plum, under this severe threat and destruction—struggle—fight—still maintain their fearless spirit; keen thinking; unwavering purpose, quietly enduring, vehemently resisting, and striving hard! (Not for compensation)</p>

<h3 id="e277">Crying and Laughing <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>"Crying" and "laughing" are innate human functions. A child bursts into tears with a cry to heaven when born from the mother's womb. After some time, under gentle comfort, the child breaks into a small smile. This is a very natural thing, and it may seem trivial to talk about it. However, if we expand on this "crying" and "laughing," from child to adult, from adult to old age; from individual to society, from society to the entire human race; then in the journey between crying and laughing, there lies an unknown amount of human tragedies, reunions, joys, sorrows, and bittersweet events.</p>
<p>Whether it is crying or laughing, both have a moving allure. Encountering a child approaching with a smiling face makes us feel that the child is cute. A woman smiling alluringly at us stirs our hearts, causing an indescribable joy. Similarly, seeing a child with a tearful face causes a feeling of unbearable sorrow. Seeing a woman sobbing uncontrollably, we can't help but feel love out of pity.</p>
<p>Many writers like to laugh and cry, and they praise "crying" and "laughing" as beautiful expressions and supreme art. Indeed, nothing in the world is more deeply and acutely touching than the feelings of "crying" and "laughing." Chinese poets and writers have the lament, "Seeing true emotions in a cry." The Japanese literary master Kuson Shiro in his book Suffering's Symbol also sings that laughter is the poetry of humanity, the art of humanity. The Soviet Union, this uniquely meaningful country, also has the government encouraging the nation to laugh by hanging signs. Bernard Shaw's "Back to Methuselah" is now popular everywhere.</p>
<p>Crying is praised, and laughing is even more formally promoted. However, living in today's desolate and tragic world, on the battlefield of life-and-death struggles, there are dry bones, wreckage, "one general's success bought with ten thousand bones" of laughter, and "still dreaming of her spring boudoir" of tears.</p>
<p>However, looking again at this broken and melancholy China, disasters flow horizontally, desolate villages and stores have turned into scorched earth, selling wives and children, even exchanging children for food. What joy is there to laugh about, what thoughts are there to cry about?</p>
<p>What love is there in crying? This is simply not the human world. There is not only no laughter, but there are simply no people crying.</p>
<p>Humorists may laugh out loud, but if they run to those desolate villages and stores, who will laugh with them when facing those ferocious, hungry faces? The poets and writers who praise "Seeing true emotions in a cry" also no longer have that kind of mournful lament to praise... Crying under the gates of the powerful, unable to get a grain of food, and on that ferocious, hungry face, not even tears can flow.</p>
<p>This broken and melancholy China is such a terrible scene, without emotion, without love, only struggle, only cruel exploitation.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people have jumped out of this tragic circle, crying and laughing. But the crying and laughing outside the circle has no real meaning; it is a vain illusion, a reflection of an empty life, and fundamentally speaking, it has no emotion and no love.</p>
<p>Crying and laughing, guided as the poetry of humanity and the art of humanity, must be elevated from the living base of this dark mass of people, restoring social peace, emotion, and love before they can appear.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Chrysanthemums <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>Today, I happened to pull down a collection of Chekhov's novels from the bookshelf and found a faded chrysanthemum petal in the book.  Memories of the past were stirred up again.</p>
<p>Last year, it was also this time of year, one afternoon.  I invited Hua to go to the Zhaofeng Garden to appreciate the autumn scenery. I wore a half-new lined jacket, and Hua added a short blue woolen</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>jacket over her green cheongsam. We brought a novel, wanting to spend this afternoon in the park immersed in the autumn scenery.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the park, it presented us with a unique and interesting scene. The wind carried fallen leaves in a dance; trees that were lush with branches and leaves a month ago were gradually becoming bald like old men. Only the towering evergreen trees provided us with a model of invigorating spirit.</p>
<p>Hua loves flowers. She likes to sit under the flowers and let them embrace her.  In the past, I couldn't muster much interest in flowers, but later I was influenced by her, and I also came to love flowers.  Because we both love flowers, we unhesitatingly left the towering evergreen trees and searched everywhere for flower clusters.</p>
<p>Although autumn, like spring, is a mild season, the flowers of autumn cannot compare to those of spring. In spring, flowers can be found everywhere, but finding flowers in autumn is a difficult task. We put in a lot of effort searching and finally found a cluster of chrysanthemums in full bloom in a corner, like Columbus discovering the New World. The color was pink, slightly tinged with yellow.</p>
<p>So we happily exchanged glances, each with a satisfied smile, then we spread our handkerchiefs on the ground and sat down side by side.</p>
<p>Hua gently plucked a chrysanthemum, smelled it at her nose, and lightly placed the flower on her apple-colored cheek.  I stared at the flower in a daze.</p>
<p>"Lovely chrysanthemum!" Hua said softly.</p>
<p>"Chrysanthemums are not lovely!" I said with a serious face.</p>
<p>"Why?" Hua asked with a slightly嗔怪 tone: "They are very lovely!"</p>
<p>"Because there is something even lovelier than chrysanthemums!" I laughed.</p>
<p>At first, Hua deliberately pursed her lips, pretending to be angry. Later, she laughed too.  She loosened her hand, the chrysanthemum straightened up again, and shook off some withered petals, which fell on our hair and clothes.</p>
<p>Hua picked up a bunch of petals, held them in her palm, and swayed them gently, like a loving mother stroking her beloved child.</p>
<p>"Chrysanthemums are always lovely! How brave they are, blooming proudly under this frost!" Hua said, puffing out her chest.</p>
<p>I nodded. Then I laughed and said, "You have some masculine spirit!"</p>
<p>We spent an afternoon like this; in laughter, in the fragrance of flowers.</p>
<p>When it was time to return, we picked up a few petals and tucked them into a book. We hoped that the fragrance of chrysanthemums would last forever.</p>
<p>Now, this petal of chrysanthemum is in my hand again. Part of the fragrance of the chrysanthemum remains, but where is the "something even lovelier than chrysanthemums!"</p>
<p>Chrysanthemum, I hope you will always preserve your fragrance! Chrysanthemum, I hope you will always be so pure and lovely! I want you to often give me sweet memories! But I don't want you to be a knowing symbol of our separation!</p>
<h3 id="e279">The Art of Facial Expression <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Min</p>
<p>Mixing in social circles and engaging in business dealings requires a close relationship with facial expressions, and they must be artistic. One's attitude must be lively and respectful. Within respect, there must also be humility, and within humility, there must be solemnity. Within solemnity, there must be some humor, and within humor, there should be some practicality. The eyes should also carry a smile, and within the smile, there should be sincerity. Facial expressions are truly difficult. If your degree of respect is excessive, some people will suspect that you have ulterior motives. Once suspicion arises, no matter what you do, you cannot be trusted, and everything will become awkward. Therefore, within respect, you must also be humble and amiable. If you are too humble, some people will treat you as a good source of funds and a pushover, and things unfavorable to you will often happen. Therefore, within humility, you must also be solemn, because status and bearing are entirely expressed through this solemnity. But if you are too solemn, some people will say that you are a moralist, pedantic, and stubborn, which will make people fear you. Therefore, within solemnity, you must also have some humor, but the humor must be appropriate. If it is all frivolous and absurd, then nothing can be accomplished, so it must also have some practicality. In short, to get along in this society of fickle affections and thin human relationships, one must have an attitude of庄谐, rounded,巧言令色, or it will be impossible to achieve ultimate victory.</p>
<p>There is a saying that calls someone "honest." As long as one is honest, no matter how twisted their heart or how fierce their methods, as long as they are resourceful, well-rounded, and use them appropriately, they can achieve success in everything. With such abilities, one can be considered a truly comprehensive, first-rate sociable person.</p>
<p>As for the facial expressions of high-ranking officials and gentlemen, they present a different scene. They display a stern and fierce expression, and put on an imposing air. Once they have power in their hands, they fear nothing. It seems that this is the only way to express the status of a big shot.</p>
<p>This is not surprising, because the deep-rooted nature of autocracy in our country is too strong. How can we talk about eliminating class concepts, let alone the word "equality"?</p>
<h3 id="e280">Regarding Japan and the US <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Recently, the matter of eight rice shops in Shanghai fraudulently using foreign brand names to import a large quantity of Japanese rice has suddenly escalated again.</p>
<p>China is an agricultural country, vast and rich in resources, known to the world for producing large quantities of agricultural products. Although it imports other industrial products due to scientific backwardness, it should always export rice and wheat. However, the reality is not so. According to recent customs reports, rice and wheat also have considerable imports every year, which truly makes people "utterly perplexed"!</p>
<p>If its own rice is not enough to supply the needs of its people, then logically demand should exceed supply, and rice prices should be high. But recently, rice prices have been low, and there is a widespread panic about "cheap grain hurting farmers," which is even more "incomprehensible"!</p>
<p>Japan is small in area, with limited agricultural production. The average farmer is also suffering from famine and has no food to eat. But this time, Japan has a large amount of rice to transport to China for sale. Can it be that they would rather starve their own people, but they must transport grain abroad? This is another "incomprehensible thing"!</p>
<p>In short, in today's world, everything, perhaps, is those "incomprehensible things"? The bombardments of September 18th and January 28th by unnamed famous painters' calligraphy and paintings of landscapes, Kong Baiyun, were from Huai Ji, who could write poetry and was especially skilled in stone carving.</p>
<p>We do not know how many Chinese people were killed. But before the bloodstains of the victims were dry, the un-victimized were willing to trade with the enemy and order large quantities of foreign rice.</p>
<p>"The hearts of the people are dead!" "Five points of warmth!" have been seen through by foreigners, so they can bomb China with airplanes and cannons as much as they want. After bombing, the Chinese will forget. When the planes are overhead, they think to themselves that they can no longer buy XX goods, but as soon as the planes pass, they forget. As long as they can make money, any business is acceptable.</p>
<p>The wave of "rural bankruptcy"! "Cheap grain hurts farmers"! has shaken the entire China, but the rice merchants in Shanghai are afraid that rice prices are still too high and that farmers have not starved to death yet, so they transport large quantities of Japanese rice to cause rice prices to continue to fall.</p>
<p>Among the 400 million compatriots in China, farmers are in the majority. Now that rice prices are so low, and the countryside is nine out of ten bankrupt, it can be said that the people of China are nineteen out of ten in dire straits.</p>
<p>The only way to maintain the solvency of the countryside is to raise rice prices to a considerable level. But now the rice merchants, who only care about their own private interests, disregard the lives of farmers and promote the sale of Japanese rice as much as possible, causing Chinese rice to fall further. Aren't they trying to put more than 300 million farmers in China in a desperate situation?</p>
