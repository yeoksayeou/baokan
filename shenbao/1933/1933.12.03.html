<h3 id="c30">救濟紙幣風潮之道明 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>徐州近以地方銀號錢莊發行過量紙幣。引起擠兌風潮。竟致牽動社會一般秩序。此次風潮。雖僅限於一地。但於黄河流域諸省區。則有莫大之影響。矧陜西當大災之後元氣未復。山西承凋蔽之餘。瘡痍滿目影響所及恐尤甚焉。。</p>
<p>夫我國整個國民經濟。特别是北方各地。匪特農村陷於破產。即以政治爲轉移之商業及農村副業中之手工業。莫不入於困窮之境。在尋常時期。則以物價低落爲太平盛世之象徵。唐代行千里者不帶糧。即其一例。然而今日之榖賤。適成爲傷農之病菌。一面榖物堆積如山。無法消售。一面餓莩載途。民有飢色。在長江流域如湖南如皖南如江蘇南部。皆痛感榖物價低之苦。而山陜等處。則饑荒糧乏。人無生路。河套則又復糧米堆積。農民哀歎。此類片面的生產過剩之結果。遂致反映物價過低。而貨幣價值。無形增長經濟之流通乃陷於停滯狀態之下矣。</p>
<p>在歐美先進諸國。中央銀行。具有統制力之國家。可發行通貨以調劑一般經濟流通之滯遲。或竟實行通貨膨脹政策。以刺激市面。以提高物價。我國因交通不便及列國經濟關係複雜。統制金融。甚爲困難。加以組織不健全。故各地方每每各自爲政。如今日之徐州一帶。與夫河南各地。不特銀號錢莊。可以不經財政主管官廳之許可。私自任意發行其所謂兌換票據。流通當地市面。更有甚者。竟將各大銀行所發行之二角票。裂而爲二。以作一角。或裂而爲四。。</p>
<p>以作五分。流通市面。民間安之若素。官廳亦未加制止。金融之紊亂。於此可見。而四川之金融狀况。尤爲奇異。當二劉各據成渝之際。成都所造貨幣。不能在重慶行使。渝廠製幣。亦不能流通至資中以上。已充分表現其割據之形態。不特此也。防區各軍駐地。皆設廠造幣。而成色之低。技術之劣。尤爲古今所罕有。銅元有大二百小二百之分。甚至將二百銅元砍爲半圓。切成四塊。致貨幣刺手。或割裂衣帶。往往而有。在所謂天府之區之四川。猶且如此。不足證明中國幣閥之畸形耶。</p>
<p>總之中國當前之經濟狀况。旣已深受歷史傳來之舊病。又感外來侵略之苦痛。在少數大都市。則苦於遊資過多。無法可　安全投出。乃羣趨於投機及不生產之事業。而農村則恰與大都市處於相反地位。一般生活。日趨愈下。農業所產之榖物。不足以與同等工值之工業生產品相交換。於是農村社會與夫中小城市中流通貨幣。皆異常缺乏。其反映於農村者。使農田日增荒廢。反映於城市者。商業日見零落救濟之道如從治標方面着想。當速圖金融統制政。</p>
<p>策之實施。從治本方面着想。中國生產。固全未開發。儘有發揮之活力。祗須排去政治上之阻害。以經濟上之恊助。即足以撥動繁榮之機器。走上建設之途徑。一般消費。即有增加之餘地。假令每人每月增加一先消費。合計全年。豈特足以繁榮我國之市場而已哉。竊願財界當局急起而圖之也</p>

<h3 id="c227">「澤及牲畜」 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>上月二十五日報載路透社柏林電：「今日當局發表命令，保護啞動物，規定凡盧待啞牲畜者，將處徒刑二年；其使之負載或轉運非其力所能勝任之工作，亦在禁止之例，同時不得用貓或狐成其他動物訓練狗頸。至於解剖動物，在原則上談止之。但公共機關爲探討所懷疑科學上之問題時，則准許解剖以釋疑問；惟民人無護照而擅行解刮者，得處六個月以上之徒刑。」</p>
<p>吾友某君，讀畢此電，喟然歎曰；「豈獨亂離人不及太平犬而己哉！同一時代同一國家之内，人民也不是不及牲畜麽」？他記得了希特拉追害猶太人及誅勦異己的事堶面路透社所傳的「澤及牲畜」的德政，却也是希特拉之所爲。所以我的朋友的　語是：「人還是投胎作牲畜去罷！」</p>
<p>但我並不這樣想。因爲我知道人類要獲得與牲畜平等的待遇，還不是絶對不可能之事，只要你能夠改變做人的態度就是了，並不定要投胎做牲畜。然則，態度該怎樣變法呢？這只要細看上面的電文便知：變「啞」。</p>
<p>吾鄉有一句俗語，是：「啞子吃黄連，有苦說不出」。可見倘不是啞子，吃了苦是一定要說出來的。但這很不對，因爲一說出便成爲對於給你苦吃者的反抗，而這是不對的。至於牲畜，則生來就啞，她們被虐待時誰也覺得很苦，然而因爲啞，所以說不出，說不出就是不說，不說就可受到保護。故生而爲人，吃了苦，而能效啞子，或牲畜，能夠不說，則也可以免禍。</p>
<p>但在希特拉的德政之下，德國人從此就不吃牛肉，不殺鷄鴨，不驅復狗馬了麽！不見得！我相信希特拉决不曾看過豐子愷先生的「護生賣集」而受了感化。我相信德國人此後依然要吃葷，依然要用獸力，不過，此後的牲畜將會特别肥胖，吃起來滋味更厚，用起來氣力更大罷了。</p>
<h3 id="c228">拉與鈎 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 懷求</p>
<p>對待「下等人」或者「帮忙」「帮閑」以取媚「上等人」，實行「推」與「踢」。這是消極一方面的手段和事業，其目的在於獻媚而已。</p>
<p>爲爬入「上等人」的階級，以取得「上等人」的名譽，攫得一官半職的實惠，又得综行積極的「拉」與「鈎」。</p>
<p>「推」與「踼」是開路或受命打掃，「拉」與「鈎」便是做自家的工作：一步步站穩脚，一級一步的爬。</p>
<p>「上等人」是不會看得你這「非上等人」起的，旣然你决心爬進那階級裏去，觀看風色是最要緊的，風色旣已看定，於是見風轉舵，追風而航，而走在前面怪有神氣的風，不會掉頭來顧及你的，於是你得跟踪大呼：「風老爺，小的在後也！」這時，你還得「推」幾手，「踢」幾脚，以表示你并非絶無能耐。偶一碰到牠一回顧，這時機會來了，你得不要命的跑上前去，一把「鈎」住，兩手「拉」緊。牠愛東走，你得跟着轉到東邊去，牠愛西方，你得轉向西方，……而時時要留心的：「鈎」之緊，「拉」之穩，否則稍縱即逝，功夫白費了。旣已「鈎」上了，「拉」住了，於是慢慢地你也變了你的本性，尾巴没了，神氣換了，神清骨秀，你便也變而爲「上等人」中之一員。</p>
<p>此外，還有兩種「拉」與「鈎」：一種是「拉」着「鈎」着一班同輩的人來供我塞寳座，登上寳座了，則或一脚踢之開去也不妨事；再一種是寳座上的人也有時要「拉」或「」鈎一些「下等人」來撑場面凑熱鬧，泰山香火之盛，即此之故。</p>
<h3 id="c229">石子車 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>天氣嚴寒，街道上充滿了蕭索的氣象。枯黄的葉片，從行道樹上落下來，舖滿了一地；偶然一陣狂風吹過，被挾着在地上飛舞了一圈，發出一陣沙沙的聲響，便又停住了，忍受着人脚和車輪的踐踏。</p>
<p>一輛塌車隆隆的在街道上經過，打破了佔據這街道很久的沉寂的空氣。車上堆滿了的全是成捆的石塊，預備運到營造廠去，給有錢人造屋用的。</p>
<p>拉車的小工共是六個人。四個在前面拉着，從車頂的鐵環上分出來的四根縴繩掛在他們肩頭，每個人的肩上，至少得負担幾百斤分量。兩個在後面推着，分據了一邊車槓，車槓是巨大的，有時得用肩背來扛。</p>
<p>「杭育！杭育！」從他們口裏發出這自然的呼聲。他們哼唧着。喘出來的氣，在寒冷的空氣裏變成了一條條的白線。</p>
<p>路，尸己經走到盡頭，將要轉變了。但離開目的地還逺。</p>
<p>天開始暗了下來，半空中蒙滿了白霧。不過他們却瞧不見。堆在他們肩上的沉重的壓力，使他們没有抬頭的可能。</p>
<p>「喂！王老大，攢一些勁兒呀！轉彎啦。」在後面推着車槓的一個人說。</p>
<p>被呼喚的王老大，下意識地緊一緊手裏的縴繩。他是個没兒子的老年人，老伴早巳死了，只有一個女兒，在紗廠裏作工，掙一些微薄的工錢，爲了生活，他雖上百年紀，也不得不出來拉這沉重的塌車。</p>
<p>車子就在這時隆隆的轉了一個彎。</p>
<p>一陣狂風挾着沙塵衝他們劈面撲來，他們全閉了一下眼睛。天氣實在非常冷，好些人裏在皮大氅裏還直打哆嗦，但他們却覺得熱，他們的心也是熱的。　　「喂！衝右首走，把車輪給拉上電車軌道去。這麽拉着就省力得多啦。」在後面推着的人，又這樣吩咐說。</p>
<p>其實用不着他吩咐，拉車的人差不多全有這種意識，車輪也就在這意識下滾上了電軌道。</p>
<p>堆在他們肩膀上的分量突然減輕了，他們不禁都吐了口長氣。同時，粗糙的話語也爆發了出來。</p>
<p>「喝！顧才郎，聽說你老婆又小產了，是不是？」</p>
<p>「怎麽不是？嘿丨小祿子，那模樣兒可眞慘哪！」說着話的願才郎，鼻腔一酸，涙珠差點没掉下來。他的眼前模糊了。他彷彿瞧見老婆躺在床上，兩個孩子在她身旁直哭。這景象，生生搥碎了這中年人的心。</p>

<p>於是他出去了。</p>
<p>這是個晴朗的日子，一點風都没有。街上的人都喜氣洋洋的，商人去做他們的買賣，事務員去上他們的寫字間，年輕的姑娘走往他們的商店。有幾個低聲唱着，因爲天氣而快樂着。到特洛威爾去的船上己經坐滿着乘客。筆爾坐在最末一張凳上。想</p>
<p>他心想Ｌ：</p>
<p>「她有没有因爲我問到這肖像而感着不安呢？或是僅僅覺得驚異呢？他究竟把它遺失了呢，還是藏了呢？她知道它在什麽地方呢，或是不知道呢？假如她把它藏了，那是什麽緣故呢？」</p>
<p>於是他一直這樣思索下去，由這裏推想到那裏，作出如下的結論：</p>
<p>那肖像，那朋友的肖像，情人的肖像，盧到某天那女人最先瞧出她的兒子和這肖像相似的時候止，是一直擺在客廳裏的。無疑的，好久以來，她便躭心着她的兒子會和這肖像相似；隨後，果然發見她的兒子長得和這肖像相似了，她看到這種相似之處的出現，她知道人家總有一天也會看出來的，她便在一個夜晚把這可怕的小畫像取去，因爲她那時不敢把它毁壞，她便把它藏起來了。</p>
<p>笨爾現在狠清楚地記起在他們離開巴黎之前很久，這小畫像便不見了。他以爲這畫像是當哲安開始生鬍子的時候不見的，因爲他的鬍子使他突然和那在她框中微笑着的有着金黄頭髮的青年相似。</p>
<p>開行了的輪船的動作，擾亂且分散了他的思想！他站起身，望着海。</p>
<p>這小輪船走出堤岸後，便向左轉，吹哨着，喘息着，顫動着，向那在晨霧中望得見的遥逺的海岸馳去。這裏那裏到處看見有張着紅帆的大釣船靜止在平坦的海面，好像大礁石伸出海面似的。而那從洛安流來的塞納河，好像海的一條大臂膀一樣，分離着兩塊相鄰的陸地。</p>
<p>還不到一點鐘，便到了特洛威爾的埠頭，因爲這正是洗海水浴的時候筆笨爾便向沙灘走去從逺處看來，海灘像是一個佈滿着燦爛的花的悠長的花園一樣，在那廣綿的黄色的沙丘上，從堤岸一直到黑岩，那些有着種種顏色的庶陽傘，有着種種形狀的帽子，有着種種差異的裝來，一團一團地聚在脫衣的小室前面！一行一行地沿着海波排立着，或是這裏那裏隨處分佈着，　像一些巨大的花束散在一個無際的大牧場上一樣。而那混亂的聲音，散在輕快的空氣裏的或近或逺的人聲，招呼聲，小孩被人洗浴時的呌聲，女人的笑聲等，這一切成了一種不斷的温柔的喧騷，混在那無感覺的微風裏，被人一同呼吸着。</p>
<p>筆爾在這些人中間走着！越覺得陌生，越覺得和他們分隔得勵害，越覺得孤獨，越沉浸在他那痛心的思想裏，就像有人在難開海岸百里之遥的海面，把他從一條輪船上的甲板上抛入了海中似的。他在他們身旁擦過，無意中聽到幾句話；無意中見到男子和女人談着，女人對男子笑着。</p>

<p>（五）經費　中國學院創辦時、中國政府本允每年津貼十萬佛郎、法國政府津貼二萬佛郎、但開辦以後、中國政府分文未付、該院得以苟延七八年者、僅賴法政府捐助之欵耳、民國十五年、庚欵問題解决、中法文化各機關、均得分潤、而中法國學院、亦年得一萬美金、於是該院之預算、乃得成立、本年賬目、尚未結算、兹將去年收支情形列後、以概一般</p>
<p>（一）收入　由法政府分給之庚欵剩餘二五三、七二五、００佛郎、合美金一萬元、法國外交部津貼二０、０００、００佛郎、上年贏餘一三八、二一０、九０佛郎、總共收入四一一、六０八、０五佛郎、</p>

<p>在上列正式收入之外、民國二十年、法國外交部、在未曾層盡之庚欵内、特别撥助三十四萬六千五百佛郎、該院將此欵以二十萬購買伯希和君之圖書、以十四萬六千五百講買中國書藉、又該院對於窮苦好事之學生、每年亦酌給津貼、或帮助論文印費等其數目由一千至六千佛郎、不等去年得此津貼、計有九人、</p>
<p>（六）圖書館　中國學院、至民國十九年、始在巴黎大學内、得有固定的房屋、内設講堂一、可容百人小教室一、自修室一、書記及圖書館員辦公室各一、其圖書卽陳列於其四廊、及各室之壁架上、</p>
<p>該院圖書館、雖成立不久、然每年在預算内、己劃定五六萬佛郎爲經常費、民國二十年、又收到大宗特欵、故其授集圖書、尤爲迅速而豐富、民國十九年、己有二萬五千卷、前任代表高曙育公使到法時、又以華人名義、贈送四千卷、伯希和君讓售者約萬餘册、去年伯君赴中國、又代該院購書兩萬噸、所藏頗多珍品、如沙畹Ｃhavanne雷池Ｌegge谷旡勿Ｃouvreur諸家之著作是也、書之種類、以文學、哲學、歷史、美術爲多、聞於各省各縣及吾國外藩之地理、風俗、羅族、各誌尤不少、其中多有絶版者、現尚未得到相當整理之人、該館主任狄巴比野、中國學識有限、不能勝任、擬從下年起、請吳康君於授課之外、兼管該館事務、吳君中法學問、均甚淵源、可謂慶得人矣、該館現在每週只開放一日、頗爲一般學予所苦、加以整理後、諒可予閱者以方便也、</p>
<p>（七）出版品　中國學院出版物、現有兩種、一爲完成沙畹遺著丨大藏經選譯丨第四册、不久可以印成、一爲德羅篤所譯之唐史、現已出版、現又决將蒙古秘史Ｌeningrad之原稿、用照相法印成兩份、以一份存該院、以一份與中國、交換書籍、此一利己利人之辦法也、</p>
<p>中國學院概况、約如上述、按該院成立迄今、雖己十三載、但自民國十五年後、始得固定其預算、完成其組織、自是逐漸發展生徒亦年有增加、刋物漸次發行、大有蒸蒸日上之勢、此乃葛蘭言君熱心辦理有以致之、又伯希和君爲該院一大柱石、得其精神上之帮助不少、彼承沙畹哥底之後、而爲法國漢學界之泰斗、今教授其間、殊增該院之榮威、此巴大中國學院、所以極爲歐美漢學家之屬目也、近三十年來歐人研究我國文化者日多、但此種大規模之研究及傳摇機關、殊不多得、我國亟宜給以切實帮助與指導、俾該院繼續發展、完成中法文化合作之使命、爲中國文明發皇光大、亦吾國之幸也、（完）</p>

<p>華塞斯之戰勝優游、原屬可能之事、但優游竟負二比十三、確爲意料不及、華塞斯陣容、日盛一日、聯絡之周密、人材、平均、以及各個藝術之出衆、爲海上足球界多年來所未及、卸知去年喧嚇一時阿伽爾、相形之下、猶不免大巫之見小巫、最初東華之以二比一勝、在眞正球藝方面而論、東華寳不如也、况斯時之華塞斯初來滬上、行裝甫卸、目下形勢、更非昔比矣、然優游人材、亦海上華人中之佼佼者、失敗原因、在於陣容之散漫、全隊爾爲爾、我爲我、不能聯絡、亦奇事也、昨日逸園三四千觀衆、於失望之餘、無不嘖嘖稱怪也、</p>
<h3 id="c247">上半時多事之秋 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>開賽後、華塞斯卽全軍開拔進攻、五分鏡内、瓊斯卽建一功、王樹森攔阻無效、守門唐永純接未得手、滑入門内、中間開球、不數往來、阿巧又中一球、優游於最時間内連失兩球、軍心不免爲之動摇、然力事振作、不稍怠懈、但不幸王樹森忽告傷脚出場、祗以十人應戰、於是風浪愈多、成爲多事之秋、華塞斯趁風打刦、如入無人之境、浩浩蕩蕩、不可一世、中鋒進第三球後、奚巧生犯規被罰十二碼、竟然不中、球由門柱彈回、往後又罰任意球、右内鋒瓊斯頂入、成四比零、優游見勢不佳、乃調莊世鴻替王樹森職、陳家球任前衛、頑强抵抗、聲勢稍振、力謀反攻、孫錦順得家球之接濟、攻入一球、此後莊世鴻又被罰十二碼球、唐永純保駕得法、化險爲夷、上半時華塞斯四比一勝、</p>
<h3 id="c248">下半時形勢更劣 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>下半時中優游益形散漫、華塞斯虎將茂林、由右翼調至原任中鋒地位、來勢格外兇猛、加以優游中堅爲一最大之漏洞、使敵軍長驅直入、横行無阻、故門前敵蹤密佈、四面包圍、眞所謂滿城風雨、草木皆兵、七八分鐘内、瓊斯對中球、優游於無可奈中、鍾勇森得孫錦順之球、單槍匹馬、搗入一球、自此以後、優游雖幾次引兵取攻、因敵壘深嚴、無懈可擊、而華塞斯可興未艾、形勢乃爲一面倒、接連打入八球之多、結果成十三比二、</p>

<p>西聯足球會、甲組今日下午三時、東華對法商一戰、爲本季足球開賽以來最吃重之比賽、法商己四戰四勝、東華三賽一勝、一和一負、形勢固不可論、但東華以防禦鞏固、聯絡緊凑見長、届時當有劇戰、勝負難於預卜、惟法商中堅虎將派克被罰停賽兩星期、今日不能出塲、賽予東華一個好機會也、比賽地點則在逸園、又曁南對西商、今日下午三時會師於棒球場、西商乃庸俗之流、曁南當可穩操勝劵、</p>

<p>昨日甲組足球共有三場、優游因陣容散漫及王樹森之傷脚離場、僅以十人應戰、實力大减、更以對華塞斯銳不可擋、氣燄如熾、造成十三比二之大比數、優游慘敗、其餘丙組、西捕三比二勝英海軍、臘克斯五比零勝沙哥爾、</p>

<p>開始接觸後、初成相持不下之勢、角逐一分鐘後、復旦因連絡純熟、馬開驊冲天一砲響、紀錄旣開、趙不忝周達雲接連命中、當江灣復得十二分時、持志尚無所獲、余俊墀錢鼎愼幾度奮鬥、果不辱使命、亦平添六分、此後持志雖屢易生力軍、終因實力較遜、無濟於事、而江灣之獲分、如黄河激流、一瀉千里、上半時結果、三十一比八江灣勝、下半時中、復旦周張暫告下野、然威燄仍盛、持志進攻、漸有發展、戰事轉趨激烈、復旦前鋒傅祥瑞投籃屢中、分數又一度激增、嗣後復旦再度遺將、從此勢更不振、結果六十比二十六江灣勝、</p>

<p>雙方交綏之下、勢均力敵、彼來此往、約二分鐘之久、各無建樹、旋因劉景峯侵入犯規、由卡遜罰中二分、於是史規亞學密斯又相繼中的、南星周憨安於萬難中奪回一球、然終因海賊之凶猛可畏、全軍忙於守禦家園、苦無進攻機會、但南星之頑抗、亦足使海賊不能暢所欲爲、如是角逐良久、海賊雖有所獲、南星亦時作投桃報李之舉、曾一度接近比數、嗣後海賊加緊工作、賴全隊合作之迅速、又被連中、上半時二十一比十、接戰聲中、風雲益形緊張、短兵肉搏、各無甚大之發展、雙方前鋒後衛、均能稱職、表演極佳、南星惜射籃不及海賊、爲最大缺點、故時失佳機、比數因此有退無進、至斯時間將終、大勢己去、總結果四十二比二十三、南星敗北、</p>

<p>初戰極形激烈、曁南前鋒人材、達較對方爲佳、黄兆霖親自動陣、連絡上更見佳妙、敢死隊本届人馬不齊、内多無名小卒、有勇無謀、皆孟獲之類耳、曁南在此情形之下、陷陣寗曼、自當如心所欲、故一刹那間、己遥遥領前、相差况有十餘分之多、但嗣後局面、敢死拚命抵禦、圖進漸難、勢成對峙、轉戰良久、曁南又趨活躍、韓振元二破敵筐、聲勢一振、上半時結束、曁南三十一、敢死十一、下半時曁南全班調換、另易五枝生力軍、雖無前塲人員之緊凑、但應付敢死、亦綽綽有餘、戰來極能旗鼓相當、如是接觸、一刻鐘後、王南珍韓振元尹貴仁又告復職、重創霸業、果然連絡有特到之處、此數又澈增、總結果曁南以五十六比二十八勝、</p>

<h3 id="c264">慾與狂 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— 康屯</p>
<p>「慾壑難塡一，這是一句人類經騐的成語。在悲觀派看來，因爲「人欲横流」，纔演成了世風日下的當前社會。由樂天派看來，正因爲人類私慾不停止的膨脹，才造成了物質上精神上光怪陸離的現代文明。</p>
<p>由食慾的膨脹，而羅列了山珍海鎰；由色慾的猖狂，而推進了藝術的璇宮；由權位慾領袖慾的擴展，而演成了政治局面的　譎雲詭；由金鏡慾的垜積，而形成了資本主義的走入極端：由求知慾的戟刺，名譽慾的迷戀，而伸張了科學的權威，以及新境界的開闢，新事物的發明。……由此人類内心的慾，做了造物的引擎，一切人事的演進都做了它的輪軸機緘，以至於大宗生產品。</p>
<p>由慾的盡量擴展而至於狂，這在抱持明哲保身底人生觀的人，是看作非常危險的一回事。可是現代文明的排演，似乎端賴這些狂人狂氣的盡量發作；這些例證，不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>，約輪富蘭克林，爲要證實他，北極航路的信念，二次向北極探險；結果，他的身體永逺葬在白皚皚的氷天雪窖之中。他的第一張北極航線地圖却給後人做了賡續探險的藍本。科克爲要尋找太平洋後面的未來大陸，乘着小船，冒着風濤，發現了澳洲東岸；而澳洲地理，大明於世。六十衰翁畢卡教授幾次升入高空平温層，造成破天荒紀錄。英國考古家安特留在最近十年内爲了考探蒙古沙漠的史蹟，竟不顧他結婚十六年的愛妻向他提出離婚訴訟。……這些實例，豈不是由於求知慾的戟刺而顯現出發狂似地傻幹嗎？</p>
<p>一假使人類只是蹈常襲故。也許今天還不脫巢居穴處的原人生活。惟其有那些明慧勇敢的先覺之士，冒險衝向荒野去，向河流去，向海洋去，向天空去；他們做了時代文明的開路先鋒，給後來的大衆遵着途徑去尋求利益。没有這些發狂的先鋒，後來的大衆便無利益可獲。」英國皇家地輿學會會長青年丈夫（ＦtancisＹoungohusband）這句話是值得學舌的。</p>
<h3 id="c265">東方樂園中之革命軼聞 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 吳心培</p>
<p>南洋檳榔嶼，山明水媚，風物瑋麗，百餘年前自入不列顚治下後，鑿山闢道，努力建設，而其美益彰，故西人有東方樂園之譽。當中山先生奔走革命時，曾數至其地，丹絨海畔，心廣園中，其爲策動革命之密勿地，與新加坡之晚晴園，霹靂之决醒園正同，豪情勝概，軼聞滋多，兹述其一。</p>
<p>民國紀元前二年，清政不綱，每况愈下，舉義屢挫，士氣沮喪，民心沉鬱，而南洋保皇黨屠用以譏訕吾黨者又無不至，於是汪（精衛）黄（復生）陳（璧君）喻（培倫）輩，思於雲深北闕處，伺攝政載澧以隙而效博浪沙之一擊，冀身教當世，振奮民族精神，但資無所出，欲行未能，陳璧君就母氏衛太夫人商，衛氏固早隸盟籍，篤信三民主義者，立允之，斥所蓄，璧君即懷疑走北京，創守眞照相館爲運彈製藥所，詎不幸事洩，汪黄被逮，陳喻僅以身免，璧君旣出險，偕胡漢民回檳榔嶼，謀所以營救之者，時中山先生適亦在檳，遂假丹絨武雅海濱之許心廣園集議營救，胡漢民報告被捕經過，述至汪黄已定讞終身監禁一語處，馨淚俱下，嗚咽不可仰，即席籌千元，又公舉吳世榮黄金慶胡漢民陳璧君等前往新加坡募欵，又得千餘元，携同香港，由黎仲實等專司接洽營救之道，當胡漢民泣下沾襟，諸同志悲憤塡膺，在在洋設法奔波救汪時，汪在北京獄中，據獄卒傳言，謂胡漢民已成仁于辛刻三月二十九日之役，汪先生哭之慟，聲以詩云：</p>
<p>「馬革平生志，君念今幸己酬，却憐二人血，不作一時流，忽忽餘生恨，茫茫後死愛，難禁十年事，潮上寸心頭。」</p>
<p>「落落初相見，無言意已移，弦韋常互</p>
<p>佩，膠漆不曾離，杜饑朝携處，韓粲夜對時，歳寒樂相共，情意勝連枝。」「日日中原事，傷心不忍聞，賦懷徒落落，過眼總紛紛，蝙蝠悲名士，蜉蝣歎合羣，故園記同眺，愁絶萬重雲。」繼復聞胡漢民之死事爲非眞，即成三律而輟，不久，武漢起義成，汪黄亦幸免於禍，當時汪胡當局及黨中諸同志，其胸中歡慰爲如何，實非吾人所能形容者矣。</p>
<p>嗚呼！國難突來，分圖繪色，外禦其侮之先决條件，在精誠團結，顧精誠團結，通力合作云云，朝野呼聲，雖己高唱入雲，而事實所示者何如哉，其以此一叚軼聞，爲今日之最高標準焉可。</p>

<p>第十九回　欲卽欲離同車憶往事　半哭半笑倚枕病殘秋</p>
<p>積之就算定了，我還是心裏有他，而且在城裏住一兩天，必定回海甸的，所以到長途汽車站上來等我。天下事不見得那樣巧，他一到汽車站就遇到我了，他許在車站上來了好幾回了。這樣看起來，他對我是一番什麽心意，大可想見了。固然，我是有了丈夫的了，不能再有外心，可是他費了這樣大的氣力，送我回海甸來，也許有什麽話要對我說，我簡直没有給他一個機會讓他把話說出來，這可是心裏過不去的一件事了。不知道他那一天還能到海甸來，他如是來的話，我應當大大方方的，向他說幾句安慰的話。只是這是作女孩子的，一叚極大的秘密，除了自己想得爛熟，那裏還能對第二個人說呢？自從這一天起心裏老是拴上一個疙瘩，覺得很是對甘二爺不起。同時，耳朶裏也不免聽到傳說，道是甘二爺兄弟不和，丢了差事都是爲了想娶楊家大姑娘的原故。他立了誓，不發財，討不着楊桂枝，就不回來。現在楊桂枝有了主了，他有多少錢，也不會討着的，看他回來不回來？桂枝聽了這些話，心裏怎樣不難受？心想，我倒想不到甘積之用情這樣的專爲我受了這樣大的犧牲。可是他得着什麽好處呢？但是他果然爲我受了犧牲的話，就不該在一個時候，甲那極冷淡的態度來對着我，外面那些傳言，也許是假的吧？他如此想着，又暗暗探聽了許多次，這消息却是越探聽越實在，甘積之果然是爲他受了犧牲的。他想人家受了這樣大的委屈，不但是得不着自己一點好處，而且還遭了自己的白眼。（二五七）</p>

<p>— 張潛九</p>
<p>天池山在蘇州西南鄉，考之志乘，乃稱華山·因山頂有池·中生千葉蓮華，服之羽化，因曰華山。山之絶頂，有巨石曰蓮華峯。又云：山上有石鼓，晋隆安中鳴，乃有孫恩之亂。又云：山半有池，在絶巘·横浸山腹，逾數十丈，故又名天池山，而華山之稱，因而不顯·</p>
<p>週者，秋咣未老，風日清華，於是鷗狎約我，同作天池之游，鷗狎善登山，能攝影，招致舟人，置樂果餌，一力任。偕行有麗人五，曰寗，曰儀，曰妮，曰蘭，曰芬，明眸皓齒，黛眉朱唇，更爲此行生色不少。</p>
<p>由蘇至天池，有二徑，一由善人橋登岸，水行費時而登山近，一由白馬磵登岸，舟程捷而登山稍遥。我等爲求其速，乃約於閶門外登舟，經楓橋古津橋，歷三時而至白馬磵·鐵舟登岸，雇人爲導，而向天池行。</p>
<p>無何·山勢漸高，拾級而上，乃入一石拱門，引導人云：是名東瑕洞。入洞才三五步，丰碑盈丈，上刋三字，曰·「天義人，字大尺餘，朱文殷然，殊不知其何所取義也。更剔蔓草，而讅其篆額則有「募緣重修賀九嶺碑」八字而已。盤旋而卜，又越一石拱門，引導人云：此乃西環洞矣。出則古寺森然，依山而立，入其中，寂若無人，一羽流靜坐觀經，問之，始應曰：此乃普濟寺也。寺隂有石，上刋寓蘇名流李印泉先生之題記，曰：一昔吳王登此賀重九，因以名嶺，於是我始恍然於賀九嶺一名之所由來也。流覽一過，更向前行，面山勢又高，道經古墓，毁敗特甚，丰碑中折，石馬失偶，想當初悉力經營時，曾料及今此之情狀乎？再前進，山路更窄，山勢益險，人在怪石中行，前呼後應，勉力而登，因留邁進之影，蓋所以見登臨之非易也。</p>
<p>迂緩曲折，而達寂鑑寺，寺前石屋高丈許，石彫佛像在焉。兹寺昔甚破敗，今之住持，始重葺之，已改舊觀矣。寺當山前平陽之區，怪石嶙峋，四周環列，寺屋向左右開展，入一月洞門，額曰鹿苑，有聯云：「不是鹿苑不是家「半畝疏菓半畝花」，清逸可誦，循廻廊而進，則敞廳三間，可以小坐，屋亦新建，李印泉先生爲題「蓮石摩天」之額。廳前有茅亭，可以品茗，亭畔有泉，漸流入一钵盂形之石穴中，了吾濟道人爲書「钵盂泉三字，大可盈丈。更流向卜，由一石龍頭中噴出，新安江肇周，乃品爲「天池第一泉云。」</p>
<p>小憇片刻，仍出寺，由左而上，至此則我人已如人石林中，石狀維何？曰清雉險怪·差可形容其萬一。路亦崎嶇曲折，更不利於行，而漸行漸險，愈進愈難，苟或不愼，則頭碎骨折，尤其小焉者耳。我與鷗狎，未來之先，卽聞登蓮華峯者，古來益無多人，一因無路，二因山險，况今者我二人又御革履，然因旣來矣，又安可不登？於是囑偕行諸君，守於山腰，我與鷗狎，乃手足齊施，攀石援草而上，更以粉筆記路徑，歷書險阻，而終於勉登其絶頂之蓮華峯。峯爲一巨石，大如三間屋，對面二石，較之稍差，二石對峙，眞如蓮華之展辦也。立而下望，惟見羣石，而凡此諸石，則拙筆更不能加以一辭矣。維時山風陡起，吹人欲墮，於是坐地蛇行而下，手足俱爲荆棘所傷，以語同人，均爲昨舌，回望山巔，蓋不勝其依戀也。</p>

<p>世界語研究專号上孔子曰：今天下，書同文</p>
<h3 id="c294">世界語的吏命丨與丨一個問題 <a href="#c294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— 公樸</p>
<p>上期本刋應讀者的需要已出了一次基本英語專號，同時並决定自本期起出幾其世界語的專號，因爲後者的歷史與範圍以及其在國際語言學上的地位，均逺超越前者之上，所以來稿自亦更多。至於我們之所以提倡研究這種國際語言學，則因近年來世界語在國際間的地位，實己蒸蒸日上，用世界語來發表意見的書報亦日多一日，世界語學會的組織，可說己普及世界的各處，尤其是被壓迫的弱小民族的國家。一個情世界語者，己可自由的到各國去旅行了，並且到處可遇到以平等相待遇没有種族成見的好朋友丨世界語的同志。因爲世界語創造者的宗旨，就是要打破國際間思想溝通的最大障碍之一丨語言的隔閡，我們知道國際間有很多很多的誤會與仇恨是由語言不通的原因而產生。世界語的宗旨旣如此，所以眞正了解世界語眞義的同志會見了，彼此是没有像普通兩個異國人於會見時所易發生的種種誤會，與各民族不同的歷史背景所造成的種種偏見。</p>
<p>中國今日是處於半殖民地的弱小民族的地位，我們不要求解放則已，如欲從事反抗這種國際壓迫的現狀，如欲實行中山先生的話丨聯絡以平等待我之民族與全世界的弱小民族，共同奮鬭，那麽提倡研究世界語，不獨可爲聯合的重要工具，並可增進國人的革命意識。我們知道世界語是今日最科學化最易學習的言語，在目前大多數人民不識字的中國，我們除必須普及本國的應用文字外，如果要提倡國人仍應多學幾種外國文的話，那麽記者以爲應首先學習世界語，因爲無論英語，法語，俄語，德語等等都是不能比世界語更容易學習的。同時我們於努力剷除文盲的工作外，至少也應當鼓勵國人學習一種外國語丨尤其是世界語。有了世界語的工具，一方面旣能了解壓迫我們的國際情形，另一方面更可鞏固全世界弱小民族聯合反抗的陣線。</p>
<p>可是記者却要鄭重聲明的，上文雖然大聲疾呼的爲世界語大宣傳而特宣傳，但記者仍是一個世界語的門外漢，不過同情於世界語創造者的逺大意志以及立志要學習這個唯一的國際語言，却是逺在十三四年前，不自今日始了。但正因爲是門外漢的緣故，現在有一個問題，不妨趁這個機會，就教於投稿的巳學習世界語的諸先進同志。這個問題就是如何使己學會世界語的人，有充分練習的機會，以免生疏而至於完全遺忘。記者日前遇見曾學過世界語的王雲五先生，叩以對於世界語的意見。王先生說，我的世界語是全忘記了，因爲練習機會太少的緣故，因此他覺得一種語言必須要有充分實地練習的機會，這種機會最好還要很自然的。換言之，就是懂世界語的人很多很多了，然後學習者方能隨時隨地容易遇到學習的機會，如其不然，就時有生疏忘記的可能。不過王先生的學習是在好多年以前，現在的情形怎樣了呢？如何解决這個問題，希望世界語的同志於下期專號中爲文解答之。</p>

<p>— 顧亦男女士</p>
<p>自十七世紀以來，人造的國際語方案，爲數當有好幾百種之多。在這幾百種方案中，只有柴門霍夫首創的世界語（Ｅsperanto），獲得一唯一的國際語的地位，在世界大衆各方面的實用中無限地發展着。世界語之所以能戰勝其他一切的國際語方案，而爲世界大衆所擁護與習用，其最主要的原因之一就是世界語本身構造上的優點：簡明，易學，而且適合於任何方面的應用。</p>
<p>世界語中共有二十八個字母。除ＡＥＩＯＵ五個字母爲母音外，其餘都是子音。不論母音或子音，每個字母只有一個音，並無長短音等等例外。一個音也只以一個字母表示。這是所謂「一母一音，一音一母」，所以世界語在發音上是最理想的文字。</p>
<p>世界語中單字的重音，不像英語那樣的隨字而異，變化莫測。世界語中單字的重音永逺在倒數第二個母音上，並無例外。譬如Ｌumo（光）這字，共有Ｕ和Ｏ兩個母音，其重音就在倒數第二個母音Ｕ上，永不變化。</p>
<p>世界語中名詞，動詞，形容詞，副詞都有一定的語尾，不若其他文字中的捉摸不着，隨地而異。世界語中名詞的語尾爲Ｏ，動詞的語尾爲Ｉ，形容詞的語尾爲Ａ，副詞的語尾爲Ｅ：一看就能瞭然。</p>
<p>世界語中有一定的語尾以表示多數，不若英語及其他文字之有許多例外（如Ｍan的多數並非Ｍans而爲Ｍen之類。）世界語多數語尾爲Ｊ，永無例外，例如「一本書」爲Ｌibro，一本以上就作Ｌibroj。</p>
<p>在其他文字中，尤其是德語法語中，每個名詞都有「性别」。例如法語中「日本」（Ｊapon）字爲陽性，「中國」（Ｃhine）一字則爲隂性。世界語中並無此種不合理之至的性的區别。</p>
<p>世界語中目的格有一定的語尾，並無例外。如說「約翰打彼得」，世界語就作ＪohanobatasＰetronoＪobano爲「約翰，batas爲「打」，Ｐetro爲「彼得」oＰetron後面的Ｎ，即目的格的語尾，一看就知道被打的人是彼得，而非約翰。因有這個目的格語尾，世界語句中的單字排列順序，可以因需要而自由變動，决不會被人誤解。例如上面那句亦可寫作ＰetronbatasＪohancoＰetro因爲後面有目的格語尾，故不至誤解爲「彼得打約翰」的。這是其他文字所做不到的。</p>
<p>世界語中共有數詞十二個，「一」爲unu「二」爲du，「三」爲tri，「四」爲kvar，「五」爲kvin…「十」爲dek，「百」爲cent，「千」爲mil。例如，「五千四百三十二，只消作kvinmilkvarcenttridekdu和中文完全一樣。英語中「五」frve，「十」爲ten，但「十五」却作fifteen　d，不作tenfrve「五十」作frfty，不作fiveten。而法語更笨，不懂呌「八十」，一定得說「兩個四十」。世界語就無比弊，「十五」爲dekkvin，「五十」爲kvindek，非常簡明而合理。</p>
<p>世界語中的接頭語和接尾語，有着很巧妙的作用。例如，bona這字，是「好的」之意，只消加上mal（接頭語，「相反」之意），malbona就成爲「壞的」之意。granda爲「大的」，malgranda則爲「小的」。再如knabo，是「男孩子」，只要加上in（接尾語，表示「女性」），knabino就成爲「女孩子」claboristo是「男工」，laboristino則爲「女工」。</p>
<p>只要在意義上講得通，世界語中兩個或兩個以上的單字，可結合而成爲合成語。例如fer（鐵）與voj（路）兩語根可結合爲fervojo（鐵路）oskrib（寫）與tabl（桌子）兩語根結合而爲skribtablo寫字檯）okvin（五），jar（年），與plan（計劃）三語根結合而爲kvinjarplano（五年計劃）。</p>
<p>明瞭了以上所述各頂優點，我們可以知道：世界語的能戰勝其他國際語，决不是偶然的。這種種優點，使世界語成爲異常規則的，簡明而易學的言語，更保證了它過去，現在以及未來的勝利！</p>

<p>— 尚可鈞</p>
<p>降了「北國之熊」以外，不論先進國或落後國的廣大民衆，都是被經濟恐慌的魔手殘害着，特别是半殖民地中國的大衆，在帝國主義特權者的壓榨之下，痛苦更深。伹同時，這種壓榨却也促成中國大衆的連結，竭力想從大石盤下挣扎出來。</p>
<p>因爲大衆的連結是這樣的重要，所以，雖然在這交通發達的世界，帝國主義特權者無法切斷大衆的互相聯絡，但特權者總是想盡方法阻止這種連結的。當他們看見世界各地大衆尚有言語的不通時，他們是非常慶幸的。語言的不通，簡直便各地大衆即使相會了也没有方法精密地討論如何解决他們自身迫切的問題。</p>
<p>然而一切特權者的夢囈到底被現實世界摯醒了。「世界語」Ｅsperanto畢竟戰勝了一切空想主義者的國際語方案而獲得全世界大多數人的一致擁戴。</p>
<p>但是也有人以爲：「世界語」與中國無關，中國大衆中文盲佔着絶對的多數，連國語也無機會學習，如何去學「世界語」呢？所以一定要在中國大衆得到民族及自身問題解决之後，才能來學習「世界語」。</p>
<p>這些話粗看是頗有理由的，但是這樣主張的人，眞是所謂「只知其一，不」知其二」。大衆要求着民族及自身問題的解决，大衆必然會得到解决的。但是怎樣去獲得解决呢？中國大衆爲獲得自由和平等，一定要如孫中山先生所說，用種種方法來「聯合世界上以平等待我之民族」，以及世界上無數受着同樣　難的弟兄，來「共同奮鬥」。而在這一個國際的「聯合」上，國際語「世界語」就有着非常偉大的意義。「世界語」决不是大衆獲得解放之後的消遣品，「世界語」是全世界大衆生「共同奮鬥」中必要的工具。正在前進中的中國大衆，無疑地必須習用這言語的工具！「世界語」的。</p>
<p>自然，在大衆達到了自身所要達到的目的之後，「世界語」將會以驚人的步伐，向它的前途進展。那時修，「世界語」將因了世界大衆的集體的創造，而達到最完美豐富的境地，而成爲大同社會的人類唯一的言語。</p>
<h3 id="c298">基本英語一世界語的比較 <a href="#c298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— 施豫</p>
<p>（一）讀音的比較</p>
<p>世界語的讀音，可算得是最合乎理想，適合於發音學的。因爲它以一個字母表示一個音，一個音也只用一個字母來表示。所以每個字母各有一個音，絶無變化。學會了它的二十八個字母的發音，就能凖確地讀出任何世界語的單字來，無論其是否已經讀過。它的重音也是一定的，永逺在倒數第二個母音上。</p>
<p>英語就完全没有這種優點。英語的讀音，在歐洲各種語言。中，要算是最煩難的一種，其本英語全部承繼了它的弱點，絶無改善。</p>
<p>譬如：世界語中Ｋ這·音，基本英語就有四個字母包含了它。如：“Ｃome的Ｃ，drink的，ＫＱujte的Ｑ，Ｅrchange的Ｘ。又如：Ｆ和ph均音F，Ｇh有時亦音Ｆ，如Rough）S和C均音S而X之中也含有S音等等。</p>
<p>這是不同的字母來表示同一個音。尚有一個字母表示好幾個音的，如C在Circle中，前面一個音S，後面一個音K；S在Business中，前面一個S作Z讀，後面兩個S則讀若一個S等等。而一個字母包含二個音的如X。兩個字母合表一個音的如ph等等，乃至有字母而不讀音的如Nigbt中的gh和Knowledge中的K和D等等。上面單就子音而言。已經不勝枚舉了。</p>
<p>至於母音，在英語裏面純母音有十二個，再加複母音共有二十一個，此外尚有三合母音。所以其表示的混亂情形，比子音更加利害。例如基本英語裏Said的ai等於end的Enot的O等於Was的A，而不等於do的O，也不等於No的Ｏ：Ｇood的ＯＯ等於Ｐuh的Ｕ，而不等於Ｆood的ＯＯ：Ｂall的Ａ等於Ｆornm的or，而不等於Ｂack的Ａ或Ｌast的Ａ；Ｔouch的ou等於Ｂut的Ｕ，而不等於Ｏut的ou；Ｂut的Ｕ却也不等於Ｐull的Ｕ；Ｆightr的Ｉ等於Ｍy的Ｙ，而不等於Ｉt的Ｉ；Ｍe的Ｅ等於Ｗeek的ＥＥ和Ｐlease的ea而不等於Ｌet的Ｅ等等。</p>
<p>此外，重音也忽前忽後的並無一定位置，此更無待舉例。所以基本英語和標凖英語一樣，每讀一個生字除記牢讀音及意義之外，還得費很多時間去死記拼法和重音。没有讀過的生字，如不查字典或請教教師，更無自行讀出的可能。</p>
<p>（二）文法的比較</p>
<p>我們把「基本英語文法」的第二章作根據來和世界語的比一比吧。</p>
<p>（一）名詞的複數，加ＳＯ但形式上的例外有六百分之七：拼音上的例外有六類。世界語則無例外地加Ｊ。</p>
<p>名詞中有百分之五十，可加語尾而成四種轉化語。世界語在意義的羅輯允許之下，任何語恨均可加語尾，而形成各種詞類；或加接尾接頭語，而形成各種新義的字。</p>
<p>（二）形容詞的比較形，加Ｍore（比較）或Ｍost（最萬）。然而有的地邓是加er或est於字後。此外尚有例外兩個。世界語則一律加pll（比較）或picj（最高）。</p>
<p>形容詞變　詞，加ly於字後，然有例外三類。世界語除基本的無語尾的副詞之外，任何語根都可以加語尾Ｅ而形成副詞。</p>
<p>（三）動詞的現在形的單數有第一二身稱和第三身稱的分别，其分别的方法又有例外四個。第三身有單數和複數的分别，第一二身稱則没有，然仍有一個例外。世界語則旣無數的區别，也無身的區别，一律加用語尾as於語根之後。</p>
<p>動詞的現在形和過去形有完全相同的，有加說尾的，有改變一二個字母的，有完全掉一個字的。而其未來形又改用助動詞的方法。世界語則一律用語尾來表示，現在as，過去is，未來os：絶並例外。</p>
<p>動詞的人命令式，用第一身稱的單數形，但尚有一個例外。世界語無例外，一律用語尾Ｕ。</p>
<p>分詞的形成也無一定方法，完全因字而異。世界語則一律用語尾ant（現在），int（過去），ont（未來）。</p>
<p>（四）副詞的比較形有例外五個。世界語的，和對付形容詞一樣，一律加pli或plej。</p>
<p>（五）代名詞的賓格，有用主格的原形的，有加以變化的，因字而異。所有格的變化也無一定凖則。世界語代名詞的所有格均加語尾a，目的格均加語尾n，而無例外。</p>
<p>（三）字彙的比較</p>
<p>倘使一種語言只有八百五十個字，則其容易學習，本有變分可信。但是人們可以把字數硬生生减少：却没有人可以把二十世紀的世界拉回到皇古的原始世界去。奥克登氏可以限定在基本英語裏只准有四種水菓，九種禽獸，三種昆蟲，却不能把其餘的水菓，禽獸和昆蟲滅種絶族，或不准任何人提到它們。</p>
<p>本來，字　的大小是要切合於生活</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) The elite troops of the Guangdong Army in Dongjiang number seventeen or eighteen regiments, stationed in various places to prevent invasion by the Fujian army. If the situation worsens, a headquarters will be established in Dongjiang, with Zhang Shigui, commander of the Independent Second Brigade, as the commander. Zhang's brigade is stationed in Chaozhou and Shantou. Military authorities have divided the entire province into three regions for defense: the Eastern Region under the command of Li Yangjing, the Northern Region under the command of She Hanmou, and the Western Region under the command of Miao Peinan. Because the generals are mostly former subordinates of the Lu Army, they can be sure of defeating the Fujian army. It is rumored that Zhang Fakui is rushing back to the country to participate in this operation. Since the Guangdong authorities announced that they do not support the Fujian affair, provincial defense work has been extremely active, especially in the Dongjiang area. Troops are being transferred from Beijiang to increase strength. According to the opinions of the public, the Fujian army will likely take the route along the southern bank of Guangdong. It is now known that the 19th Route Army has built a road near the Guangdong border. Military authorities here believe that the Dongjiang area, with its twenty-seven regiments and two air force squadrons, is well-defended, and the Fujian army will not succeed in invading.

After the 14th Brigade of the Japanese Army was transferred from Yuguan to Jinzhou, Yuguan still has a large team left. Yuan Teng is responsible for handling everything in Yuguan. Now that the acceptance period for Yuguan is near, the 14th Brigade stationed in Yuguan will be completely withdrawn, so the Kwantung Army temporarily appointed Iwai as the head of the special service agency stationed in Yuguan to be responsible for handling all liaison matters between the army and the interior. The Luanyu Administrative Office has found a site next to Tangshan Railway Station, and personnel will be sent to organize its establishment in a few days. Chai Shan said that there is no problem with the return of Yuguan, and the rumors of additional complications are not true. The Manchurian postal, customs, and police agencies in Yuguan City will be moved out after the new houses are built. The return of Yuguan is only a matter of time and can be done before January 1. There is still a battalion of the 14th Brigade stationed in Yuguan, which will be withdrawn upon acceptance. The garrison troops will still be stationed in their original location. The garrison commander was originally Major Wakakawa, but now it has been replaced by Major Kawakawa.

As a result of the meeting, the Japanese side stated that there is no problem with the return of Yuguan, but the Japanese are currently building barracks and markets in Luocheng, four miles east of Yuguan. After the project is completed, the Yuguan Post Office, Customs, Police Station, and local maintenance associations and other pseudo-organizations will be withdrawn, and our side will begin the acceptance. There are currently two squadrons, two thousand people, of Japanese troops stationed in Yuguan. Those belonging to the Kwantung Army will be withdrawn to Suizhong at the time of the handover of Yuguan. Those belonging to the Otsu garrison army will be stationed in the Nanhai barracks and will still be stationed there according to the Boxer Protocol. After the meeting, Tao and Zhu returned to Tianjin to report to Gan, and returned to Beiping this afternoon to report to Huang and He on the negotiations and the date of acceptance. Tao is scheduled to go to Tangshan in four or five days to discuss with the Japanese side again. However, the Japanese side will include Luocheng under the jurisdiction of the puppet state and set up a market. Our side did not mention this when Okamura came to Beiping. Because Luocheng is the outer city of Yuguan, only separated by a Great Wall, it is still necessary to negotiate with the Japanese side. As for the activities of Japanese and Korean thugs after the acceptance of Yuguan, the Japanese side has agreed to assist the Kwantung Army or the garrison army to eliminate them. Banditry will be cleared by our security forces. Yin Shousong, the magistrate of Linyu County, will be replaced, and the successor is Yuan. (2nd dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Side Establishes Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in Dolon</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the issue of Inner Mongolia autonomy, Huang Shaoxiong made a final discussion with Zhao and Fu at the Sui Provincial Government on the 2nd. On the 3rd, Huang and others went to Taiyuan to meet with Yan to negotiate. They will transfer to Jiangxi without staying for a long time. Before the promulgation of the organizational law of the autonomous region government, a preparatory committee for the regional government will be established to prepare for autonomous affairs first. The eleven banners of Sili League and Wulan League decided to send one representative from each banner, a total of twelve people, to gather in Beiping and go to Nanjing together. In addition to thanking the government, they also requested the prompt promulgation of the organizational law of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region government to implement autonomy. (2nd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side is still eager to plot Mongolia and has established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in Dolon to prepare for the invasion of Inner Mongolia. Our authorities have decided to negotiate with the Japanese side through diplomatic channels to cancel it. (2nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Guihua Huang Shaoxiong and Zhao Pilian conducted another round of discussions on Mongolian affairs with Fu Zuoyi and others on the 2nd. They left Sui on the 3rd to visit Yan Xishan in Taiyuan to discuss the situation of the inspection of Inner Mongolia. Fu Zuoyi also went with them. Huang said that he would not stay in Taiyuan for long and would go to Hankou and then to Jiangxi. The outline of the autonomous government of the Inner Mongolia region has been determined. The detailed measures will be published after being reviewed and approved by the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan. The Chahar and Sui provincial governments both agree with the principles set by the central government and have no objections. The territory of the Mongolian banners originally belonged to the provincial government and will not be changed. In the past, each banner was parallel to the provincial government and used consultations for official documents. In fact, there are agencies within a province that are under the provincial government and those that are directly under the central government. This point is not significant. He did not know much about the internal affairs of the Fujian Incident. He was responsible for important tasks in Sui regarding Mongolian affairs. Due to his mission, he had no time to pay attention. Li Fuying left Sui on the 1st to return to Yanggao for defense. After the party ended, Huang and Zhao gave gifts such as yellow satin to each Wang, duke and representative as a souvenir. The Dalda and Meng Er total supervisors of the flags, Fu Xiande, the representative of the Zhenghong Banner, and Guanshu Shi, the representative of Zhangjia, returned east in the same car. Prince Yun has appointed Geiyong Tursudai and other four people to go to Beijing to meet with officials in the near future to thank the central government for solving the Mongolian affairs and to discuss the detailed method of the autonomous government.

<p>(Nanjing) A certain senior official of the Ministry of Communications said: (1) The radio stations in Fujian have been forcibly taken over. However, Jiang, the director of the Fujian Provincial Bureau of Telecommunications, was recommended by Jiang Guangnai and naturally agreed with it, so there is no need to replace him. Regarding the forced takeover, the official documents of the telecommunications agency are now suspended from posting and sending by order of the Executive Yuan. (2) In terms of shipping, in addition to ordering the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to stop opening ships to Fujian last week, yesterday it ordered the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau to instruct all Chinese shipping companies to stop opening the Shanghai-Fujian route to avoid accidents. As for foreign ships, only Jardine Matheson, Swire, and Nisshin companies are still running as usual. As for the Shanghai-Guangdong air route passing through Fuzhou and Xiamen, the Fujian side has not dared to interfere with the planes even though they are flying because the company is a Sino-US joint venture. It is still flying. (3) As for postal services, it is still as usual to date. Because the government is concerned about the communications of the people in Fujian, it is not convenient to block them suddenly. The response measures will be determined after observing the situation in Fujian and resolving the central government's policy on the Fujian rebellion. It is too early to talk about the issue of closing the mail. It may be realized if necessary. (2nd dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) At 8:00 p.m. on the 1st, the headquarters broadcasted a report on the bandit situation. Most of the pseudo-First Army Corps and part of the Fifth Army Corps suffered repeated heavy blows in the previous battles in places such as Shengang, Dangkou, and Daxiongguan, and their elites were almost completely lost. According to reports, the bandits are now hiding near Xinshanshi to survive. Our troops on the entire line are also conducting a strict search of the area to wipe them out in one fell swoop. The pseudo-Third and Seventh Army Corps and most of the pseudo-Fifth Army Corps have also gathered the remnants and fled to places such as Shixia Zhongzhan, Xiong Village, and Deshengguan in the southeast of Lichuan due to the disastrous defeats of the main forces. They have been bombed by our air force from time to time and are in a state of chaos. As for the pseudo-Fifth Army Corps' 13th Division and part of the pseudo-19th Division, which were defeated by us at Dianshan Shangnan, they have fled to Hejiazhuang, Xiong Cunwei, and Qingshan Lake. Our army has sent teams to pursue them. (1st Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e27">Guizhou Military Infighting Has Not Ended; The Eastern Route Is Especially Tense <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the situation in Guizhou Province, Wang Jialie's representative and the Guangdong representative in Nanjing both denied the conflict. The latest detailed report obtained by Beijing is as follows: Since the Tongzi faction implemented infighting in Guizhou, Mao Guangxiang and Wang Jialie, as in-laws, have been determined to compete, and there seems to be no room for mediation. Moreover, Xiong Yibin, who single-handedly created the faction, recently passed away. There is no one in Tongzi who can unite the faction. The so-called mediation is just a delaying tactic by both sides. Moreover, the number of those who seek positions as committee members inside and outside is increasing day by day. It is necessary to obtain a provincial committee to make up for the Yuli Guizhou Company. It can be seen that the Guizhou war is mainly due to the instigation of politicians. The recent war situation is more tense on the eastern route. For example, Shi Fengyi's Nong Zhan Qingxi, Yang Qichang's occupation of Jiangkou, and Lei Fengjiu's occupation of Yanhang, Sinan and Yinjiang counties in the northeast in just a few days (it is said that Wang Jialie ordered Liao Huaizhong to shorten the front line), will obtain contact with Jiang Zaizhen, who has been trapped in Dongxi for a long time (Qijiang County, Sichuan Province, is connected to Tongzi, northern Guizhou), etc. These are drastic changes that have not occurred in half a year. Moreover, Jiang Zaizhen's visit to Chongqing this time resulted in a business meeting with Liu Xiang, and he obtained 200,000 bullets and 50,000 yuan in funds, which were returned to Guizhou from Chongqing on the 24th of last month. It is seen that the essence of the northern route will inevitably cut off the eastern route and turn it into ruins. As for You Guocai on the western route, he is known for his fence-sitting reputation and listens only to the orders of Yunnan's Long Yun. Currently, Yunnan is facing pressure from Liu Wenhui's remnants (Yanjin and Suijiang areas in northern Yunnan) and has an agreement to join hands with Xixing. That is, Yunnan will send troops to help You Guocai, and Guangxi will not send troops to support Wang Jialie. After Wang's troops collapse, Gui, a former Guizhou military commander, will be reinstated as the commander. Both Yunnan and Guangxi have telegraphed for approval. It seems that the original treaty behavior between You and Yunnan has been invisibly torn to pieces. Therefore, Long Yun has not only failed to send a soldier or increase a bullet to help You recently, but has also ordered You's troops to retreat to the Huajiang River (You purchased 600 guns and 200,000 bullets from France last month, which is a sign of independence to Long). This also affects the northeast route, and they dare not rush directly to Guiyang. Not to mention that Mao Guangxiang, who is known as the leader supported by the coalition forces, seems to have been under house arrest in Chishui for a year. His confidential secretary, Fu Changmin, was captured and executed by Hou Zhidan, and his confidant and plenipotentiary representative, Qiu Yunchang, recently had a major conflict with Guizhou groups in Shanghai and even hid in a certain hotel, changing rooms several times a day. (In addition to strictly criticizing Qiu outside a building on Boerbu Road, the Guizhou student group will issue leaflets and publications to expose the crime of Qiu's falsely receiving 120,000 yuan in disaster relief funds). It is inevitable that Mao will repeatedly lose his claws and teeth, and he will have to issue a circular stating that he will not read letters and telegrams from all parties. Lei and Yang, who are in the coalition forces, were misled by someone's boasting and missed the opportunity, allowing Wang Jialie's troops to take advantage of it and concentrate their forces. Now, He Zhizhong flew from Changsha to Guiyang to become the commander-in-chief of the various armies. He is the most courageous of the local troops. Now that Sichuan and Yunnan are not allowing the addition of troops to invade Guizhou, and Wang's Minister of Finance has just sold 50 loads of opium from Guangdong for military expenses and returned with a full load, it can be concluded that the Guizhou war will not only become a continuation of the Sichuan split in the near future, but will inevitably lead to the Balkans of the southwest.

<p>(Hankou) On the 1st at dawn, the five routes of the Sichuan Army launched a general offensive on Suixuan. Yang's army and the pseudo-Fifth Army were locked in a stalemate at Yingshan Xin Xingchang. Furthermore, the remnant bandits of He's bandit group, numbering only 3,300, invaded Weifeng and did not retreat, fleeing to Lichuan Daji Chang and Heping Xiaoguan. (Special dispatch of the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Sichuan Province bandit suppression military expenses, Liu Xiang had previously requested an allocation of 10 million yuan, but the government replied that it was difficult to raise funds immediately. However, Liu further requested the Central Government to allocate 3 million yuan first, which was agreed to be provided immediately.</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Li Qixiang's troops of the Third Route have advanced to Gong Gaofengchang, and Luo Zezhou has advanced to Xu Jiacang. Tian Jun's troops of the First Route, led by Tan Ning and others, are at Xiandianzi Dadongshan. Currently, the formations of each unit properly form a ladder shape. Many hidden bandits have recently been captured, appearing to have dispersed into smaller units. Liu Xiang has telegraphed for a swift attack on Yilong, with the aim of encirclement. Another telegram states that Li Qixiang's troops of the Third Route, in coordination with Yang Sen's troops, captured Yingcheng and are now focusing on the left flank, having advanced to the Xu Jiacang, Hui Chang, and Gao Shan Chang area, approaching Yilong. When Li's troops were pursuing bandits at Huilongchang, they captured bandit battalion commander Lu Zesheng and dozens of soldiers, as well as dozens of rifles, in Lan Nigu. When the remaining bandits retreated, they also ambushed in caves and ditches, intending to attack from the rear when the pursuing troops approached, but they were all discovered by the government troops.

<h3 id="e30">Clarifying the Way to Relieve the Paper Currency Crisis <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou has recently experienced a run on local banks and financial institutions due to the excessive issuance of paper currency. This has led to a general disruption of social order. Although the crisis is limited to one area, it has a significant impact on the provinces in the Yellow River basin. Moreover, Shaanxi, still recovering from a major disaster, and Shanxi, bearing the scars of desolation, are likely to be even more affected.</p>
<p>Our nation's overall economy, especially in the northern regions, is in a dire state. Not only is the rural area bankrupt, but also the commercial and rural sideline industries, dependent on political developments, are in extreme poverty. In normal times, low prices are seen as a sign of a prosperous age. For example, during the Tang dynasty, travelers going a thousand miles did not need to carry provisions. However, today's low grain prices have become a disease harming farmers. On one hand, grain is piled up like mountains, impossible to sell off. On the other hand, the starving are all over, and the people look hungry. In the Yangtze River basin, such as Hunan, southern Anhui, and southern Jiangsu, people all feel the pain of low grain prices, while in Shanxi and Shaanxi, there is famine and a lack of grain, with no way out for the people. The Hetao area, on the other hand, has grain piled up, and farmers are lamenting. This kind of one-sided overproduction has led to excessively low prices, and the value of money has increased invisibly, causing the economic circulation to stagnate.</p>
<p>In advanced countries in Europe and America, the central bank, with its power of control, can issue currency to adjust the sluggishness of general economic circulation, or even implement a policy of currency inflation to stimulate the market and raise prices. In our country, due to inconvenient transportation and complex economic relations with other countries, controlling finance is very difficult. Furthermore, the organizations are unsound, so each locality often does things its own way. In areas like Xuzhou today, and in various parts of Henan, not only can banks and financial institutions issue their so-called convertible notes at will without the permission of the responsible financial authorities, but, even worse, they even tear the two-jiao notes issued by major banks in half to make one-jiao, or tear them into four pieces</p>
<p>to make five fen and circulate them in the market. The people are at ease with it, and the government offices have not stopped it. The disorder in finance can be seen here. The financial situation in Sichuan is even more peculiar. When the two Liu's each occupied Chengdu and Chongqing, the currency made in Chengdu could not be used in Chongqing, and the currency made in the Chongqing factory could not circulate above Zizhong. This has fully demonstrated the form of their separation. Not only that, but each army garrison in the defense zone has its own factory to mint coins. The low quality and poor technology are rare in ancient and modern times. Copper coins are divided into large 200 and small 200. Some even cut the 200 copper coin into half circles and cut them into four pieces, causing the currency to prick the hand or cut the clothing. This is often the case. In Sichuan, the so-called "land of abundance," it is still like this. Doesn't it prove the deformed nature of China's monetary magnates?</p>
<p>In short, China's current economic situation has been deeply affected by the old diseases inherited from history and has also been affected by the pain of foreign aggression. In a few big cities, there is a surplus of idle funds that cannot be invested safely, so they flock to speculative and non-productive businesses. The countryside, on the other hand, is in the opposite position to the big cities. The general standard of living is declining day by day. The grain produced by agriculture is not enough to exchange for industrial products of equal value. As a result, the currency circulating in rural society and small and medium-sized cities is extremely scarce. Reflected in the countryside, it makes arable land increasingly barren. Reflected in the cities, business is declining day by day. If we think about the way to relieve the situation from a superficial point of view, we should quickly implement a policy of financial control.</p>
<p>If we think about it from a fundamental point of view, China's production has not yet been fully developed, and there is plenty of vitality to be exploited. It only needs to remove political obstacles and provide economic assistance to start the machine of prosperity and embark on the path of construction. There is room for increasing general consumption. Suppose each person increases their consumption by one cent per month. When totaled for the whole year, it will not only be enough to prosper our country's market. I humbly hope that the financial authorities will get up quickly and plan for it.</p>

<p>(New York) According to news from Japan, Japan hopes for peace in the Pacific and is preparing to hold preliminary talks with Britain and the United States to prepare for the 1935 naval conference. The New York Morning Telegraph commented on this news, saying that what Japan most hopes for is "Japanese peace in the Pacific." The newspaper said that Japan first hopes to maintain peace with Soviet Russia. Japan is asking Soviet Russia to withdraw its military preparations from the border area of ​​Russia. As for Japan, it intends to abolish the border defenses of land that does not belong to Japan but borders Soviet Russia. The reason for this is to preserve its recently occupied land. This is what Japan hopes for first. Secondly, Japan hopes to hold preliminary talks with the United Kingdom and the United States to prepare for the future naval conference, so that its demand for naval equality can be realized. Moreover, China is now experiencing turmoil in Fujian. Japan will take this opportunity to use the tension in the European situation to make Soviet Russian interests and British and American interests stand in opposition, so as to reap the benefits. This is what Japan hopes for second. The New York Evening Post concluded, "It is hoped that the diplomats of the countries concerned will be able to use their keen skills to expose Japan's diplomatic conspiracy and not fall into its trap." (Havas dispatch of the 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota's statement that he intends to start preliminary negotiations with the United States in order to successfully hold the 1935 disarmament conference has given a good impression to the United States and the United Kingdom, which have the same naval power as the United States. On the 1st, Foreign Minister Hirota specially ordered Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira to explain to the British government Japan's views on the Japan-U.S. preliminary negotiations for reference. The content is as follows: The Japanese government's attitude towards the preliminary negotiations of the disarmament conference is that, in order to successfully hold the 1935 conference, it intends to conduct preliminary negotiations with two or three countries directly related to it. However, whether it will conduct this discussion exclusively with the United States in the future depends on the future situation. Please do not misunderstand this. (Domei dispatch of the 2nd)</p>

<p>Rome Reporters who attempted to obtain an interview with Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov on the Italian ship were unable to achieve their goal. Litvinov was unwilling to make any statements until he arrived in Rome. Today, famous Italian newspapers all published lengthy editorials, emphasizing the importance of relations between Russia and Italy, and stating Italy's willingness to increase trade relations with Russia, attract Russia to join the League of Nations, and participate in the disarmament conference.

<p>Rome The postal ship carrying Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov will not arrive here until tomorrow due to bad weather, and he is scheduled to meet the Italian Emperor on the 4th of this month. Litvinov will host a banquet for Prime Minister Mussolini at the Russian Embassy and will attend the Turkish Ambassador's welcome banquet. It is widely believed that the Italian Prime Minister's invitation to the Russian Foreign Minister to come to Italy has two major purposes: (1) Italy was the first among the major powers to recognize Soviet Russia. Therefore, the relationship between Russia and Italy is progressing more smoothly than the relationship between Soviet Russia and other major powers. Therefore, when allocating trade, Soviet Russia should pay special attention to Italy. (2) Invite Soviet Russia to join the disarmament talks. (Reuters dispatch of the 1st)</p>
<p>Rome Financial circles here believe that after Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov hold talks this week, they may discuss a deal in which Soviet Russia will transport American cotton that it has borrowed to Italy to pay for promissory notes signed by the Russian government under the recent three Italy-Russia trade agreements. In addition, they also plan to discuss expanding the strong group, adding the United States, Russia, and Japan to form a group of seven powers. (National News dispatch of the 1st)</p>

<p>Rome The "Italian Daily" tonight denied the rumors about the intentions of Litvinov and Mussolini. However, there is no doubt that when the two meet, they will inevitably discuss the issue of disarmament and the European situation caused by Germany's withdrawal from Geneva. However, regarding the issue of disarmament, Litvinov's proposed policy, although its goal is the same as Mussolini's, its methods may not be consistent. In addition, the issue of Japan will probably also be discussed by Litvinov and Mussolini. Newspapers today also said that this meeting was initiated by Mussolini, and Litvinov was only invited here to listen to the Italian Prime Minister's opinions. (Havas dispatch of the 1st)</p>

<p>Rome The "Roman People's News" commented on the purpose of Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov's visit, saying that whether in Europe or in the world, all countries that sincerely love peace need to cooperate with each other to stop all kinds of destructive work and disturbing forces, and there is probably no time more urgent than today. Continuing to discuss the issue of disarmament, it said that direct negotiations are more likely to achieve satisfactory results than the Geneva parliamentary-style and theatrical-style methods.

<p>Rome The Italian newspapers are now beginning to comment on Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov's visit to Rome. The "Tribune" said that this is the first time that the Soviet Russian foreign affairs authorities have visited the Italian capital. In 1922, Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Chicherin only came to Genoa and did not come to Rome. The newspaper also said, "Litvinov's visit to Italy comes at a time when European governments are negotiating disarmament issues, the current situation in Germany, and difficult events such as the Geneva crisis. He must feel particularly interested in his observations of the situation. His exchange of views with the Italian authorities will therefore feel more beneficial." The Tribune continued, "The disarmament issue has not been resolved, and it is extremely urgent for the major powers responsible for international peace and order to cooperate. Soviet Russia is one of the so-called major powers responsible for international responsibilities. Italy believes that it is extremely important to study and solve major international issues and let Soviet Russia participate. Italy has its own certain opinions and plans on the current major international issues, and it is natural to exchange views with Soviet Russia to determine each other's views. Moreover, Italy is exchanging views with other major powers, and the matter of contacting Soviet Russia is the same. Rome and Moscow signed a treaty of friendship on September 2. With this treaty, the nature of this exchange of views will be particularly coordinated and constructive. Because before September 2, there was only a passive relationship of non-aggression between Italy and Russia. Since the establishment of the treaty of friendship on September 2, the two countries have been working together in a spirit of practical cooperation to maintain world peace and set an example for the international community. Its role is not limited to a passive nature. The talks between the authorities of the two countries in Rome will be extremely beneficial and important. The two countries will rely on the stability of their political system and foreign policy to guarantee the future of their current policies and the promises they are about to make. Italy's policy towards Soviet Russia recognizes its value." (Havas dispatch of the 1st)</p>

<p>(Paris) The Times commented on the Pacific issue in a special article, which said in brief: "When Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov returns from the United States and goes to Italy to meet with Mussolini, general attention will naturally be focused on the Far East. Moreover, the situation in the Far East and the Pacific is the main reason for the United States to recognize Soviet Russia and restore formal relations between the two countries, and there is no doubt about that. The possibility of conflict between Japan and Soviet Russia will affect the diplomacy of a certain country in Europe, which is indeed possible. The reason why the talks that Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov is about to conduct are particularly interesting is precisely because of this... If Japan and Russia unfortunately go to war, China's position will be very important. Even if China does not actively cooperate with any country at war, but only takes a well-intentioned neutral attitude, it will be of great convenience to that country. Therefore, both Japan and Soviet Russia are working hard to make China take this attitude in the future conflict between the two countries. The reason why Japan is striving to improve its relations with China and seek understanding with Nanjing, and the reason why Soviet Russia is trying to consolidate the position of the Chinese Communists and recognize them as reliable is all for this reason."

<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson today strongly demanded the expansion of the U.S. Navy in his annual report, saying that the time has come when the United States can no longer take the lead in reducing military preparations. Other countries have not followed in the footsteps of the United States, so the United States now feels that its naval power is far inferior to others. The weakness of the U.S. military position does not benefit peace, but rather hinders it, because military preparations that are not weaker than others can make diplomacy powerful. Therefore, military preparations of equal strength are an important tool for maintaining peace and justice, and military preparations that are too weak will only lead to aggressive wars and the destruction of a country's rights. He firmly believes that the most powerful guarantee of peace and justice is a fully adequate U.S. Navy. By a fully adequate U.S. Navy, he means a navy that is not in second place according to conventions. The United States should have a gradual replenishment program for building ships every year, so that the United States can soon obtain a navy that meets the limits of the convention, that is, with the existing ship-building program, the United States must continue to build one hundred and one ships in order to obtain the full power permitted by the convention at the end of 1936, when the convention expires. The previous ship-building program was unsystematic and cost a lot, so that all but four U.S. destroyers will exceed</p>

<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reported on November 29 that senior Soviet officials of the Chinese Eastern Railway held a secret meeting in Harbin on the 27th. The details are as follows: (1) To contain Japan and "Manchukuo" from taking over the Chinese Eastern Railway, to protect the rights of the United States to invest in the Soviet territory in the Far East, and to entrust the administration and operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Siberian Railway to the United States for a considerable period of time; (2) Since the United States has recognized Soviet Russia and restored diplomatic relations, it should immediately stop negotiating with Japan and "Manchukuo" on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway and recall the Soviet representative stationed in Japan. It is worth noting whether the above two agreements have been concretized. However, the second item, the suspension of negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway, has become a fact after Russia and the United States restored diplomatic relations. Moreover, Russia often has out-of-bounds diplomacy, causing disputes in the Far East and instigating the powers to suppress Japan, which is especially wary of our military (Japan).</p>

<p>(Washington) Amidst the rumors of renewed wars in Europe and the Far East, well-informed sources here have been speculating about the impact of future wars on people and money. According to recent statistics on the results of the European War, the total war expenses consumed by the world were 30 trillion gold dollars, and the United States consumed 390 billion gold dollars. The number of people who participated in the war was 65,038,000, the number of dead was 8,538,315, and the number of injured was 21,219,452. Future wars will be even more fierce and mechanized, and the loss of soldiers and money will far exceed this number. This can be seen from the cost of raising troops in peacetime. Before the European War, the total cost of raising troops in the world was only 2,750,000,000 gold dollars, while the recent budgets of various countries have reached 5,500,000,000 gold dollars, which is more than double. It is also a focus of speculation for various countries whether American bankers are willing to lend to foreign governments for the expenses of new wars. At the beginning of the last European War, the national treasuries of various countries were soon emptied, and they borrowed money from banks in New York and Boston. At present, many Americans have invested abroad, totaling 17,000,000,000 gold dollars in 1930, and many of these loans are now overdue. Therefore, it is also a matter of doubt whether foreign governments can obtain loans here again for non-productive war expenses. (National News dispatch of the 1st)</p>

<p>(London) Researchers investigating the Lancashire market situation have discovered that Manchester is now purchasing Japanese rayon in an effort to avoid being completely ousted from overseas markets. The price of the rayon fabric purchased is ten and a half pence per yard. If Britain were to manufacture this product, the cost per yard would not be less than one shilling and eleven pence. Therefore, workers themselves are compelled to purchase fabric woven from Japanese raw materials due to economic hardship. The Morning Post reports on the movement to prevent yarn mills from selling at a loss, stating that manufacturers are currently voting on the issue of fixing prices. More than 300 yarn mills are involved in this matter. However, the implementation of this plan requires the consent of more than 90% of the members. The proposer advocates incorporating all yarn mills into a publicly elected permanent committee. (2nd, Reuters)</p>

<p>(Paris) The new cabinet addressed parliament this afternoon, outlining its administrative policy, the main points of which are the immediate balancing of the budget and the continuation of the previous government's foreign policy. The government, to ensure public safety, demands immediate action to balance the budget, and asserts that if this is not done, the consequences will be dire. It also stated that prolonged deficits endanger the national treasury and encourage speculation. France can have confidence in its own future and the health of its currency, but the situation requires an immediate and effective solution. As for foreign policy, France continues to adhere to its previous policies regarding engagement with the League of Nations, international cooperation, friendly relations, and negotiated agreements. The French government is now prepared to seek ways to enhance relations with all countries through ordinary diplomatic channels. However, unilateral agreements cannot contribute to peace unless they respect the international agreements by which our descendants wish to safeguard their rights.

<p>(Berlin) The German Industrial Employers' Association, once powerful, has decided to dissolve today after a meeting of association leaders and reorganize as members of the Labor Front under the direction of Dr. Ley. According to Dr. Ley, the dissolution of the Employers' Association is a natural development of National Socialism, which values public interest over individual interests. Anyone engaged in any aspect of production work should unite to form a great labor front based on mutual respect among comrades. Once this front is established, he will set up an employers' team for each type of industry so that the interests of employers can be protected as before, but they must abide by the doctrines and laws of the Nazi Party. As such, factories are not allowed to strike, and the rulings of the labor bureau must be followed by both labor and management. The new German labor regulations will take effect on December 15, and the new labor bureau will also be established at that time. All labor matters will be under its management, and the hiring and firing of workers in the market will be subject to its control. (1st, Reuters)</p>

<p>Warm Springs: President Roosevelt declared that rumors that the United States has concluded a monetary agreement with Britain are completely ridiculous. Yesterday, at a Thanksgiving banquet hosted by the U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Bingham, for American expatriates in Britain, he said that the reasons for abandoning the gold standard were the same for both Britain and the United States, but Britain had an exchange equalization fund, while the United States did not. The United States could also benefit if it followed suit. The talk of a monetary agreement may have originated from this. (1st, Havas)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Roosevelt administration is about to continue to implement monetary control policies and purchase cash on foreign markets. The White House clearly wants to sufficiently lower the price of the dollar so that before Congress convenes in January next year, domestic prices, especially agricultural prices, can rise significantly. The government also wants to lower the price of the U.S. currency to a level where the value of the gold held by the Federal Reserve Banks can be re-evaluated, and then increase the amount of paper money issued to implement a prepared monetary policy. However, this does not mean that the dollar will be stabilized. President Roosevelt is determined to test the "commodity dollar" theory, in other words, to stabilize the dollar based on the general index of domestic prices. The gold value of the dollar can still change with the rise and fall of the gold value of goods. (1st, Havas)</p>

<h3 id="e109">Guangdong Troops Withdraw from the Fujian Border, Defending the Upper Reaches of the Han River, Fujianese Follow the Troops into Guangdong <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>A Shantou correspondence reports that since the emergence of the Fujian Provincial People's Government, the Fujianese residing in Chaozhou and Shantou are extremely anxious. The southern Fujian region has suffered greatly from banditry, leading more than 10,000 locals to wander in Chaozhou and Meizhou, a truly pitiful sight. To date, there is no way to provide relief. Fortunately, the Guangdong troops entered Shanghang, Wuping, and Yongding, gradually restoring the original order. Now, with the Fujian incident occurring, the Guangdong-Fujian border military situation has suddenly become tense. Shantou and various counties and cities have simultaneously announced martial law, and troop movements are busy. According to visitors from the upper reaches of the Han River, Jiaoling, Pingyuan, Meixian, Xingning, and Dapu have suddenly increased their troop deployments. The supply of firewood, charcoal, rice, vegetables, fish, and meat is exceeding demand. It has been found that these troops were withdrawn from Shanghang, Wuping, Yongding, Xunwu, and Anyuan on the Fujian-Jiangxi border to show that they would not participate in the Fujian incident. The defensive positions abandoned in Yongding, Wuping, and Shanghang were handed over to the Zhong Shaokui Guerrilla, a unit reorganized from armed militias. The former blockade lines against Changting and Liancheng have been abandoned. It is now heard that Huang Renhuan is responsible for arranging the new defense line on the Fujian-Guangdong border and has dispatched Chief of Staff Zeng Juzhi to report everything to the province. The two divisions of Li Hanhun and Zhang Da are between Lianping, Heping, Wengyuan, and Longchuan. The division of Li Zhenliang is in Yuning, Wuhua, Zijin, and Fengshun. The three divisions of Huang Baowen, Huang Yanzhen, and Huang Renhuan are in Xingning, Pingyuan, Jiaoling, and Dapu. Zhang Ruigui's division is in Raoping and Chao'an, and they are coordinating with each other, adopting a defensive strategy. However, when the Guangdong troops withdrew from the Fujian border to Guangdong, the locals followed the troops into Guangdong to avoid banditry. Therefore, various Fujianese hometown associations residing in Chaozhou and Meizhou have sent telegrams to Fuzhou to advise Chen Mingshu and others. (November 24)</p>
<h3 id="e110">Guangdong and Hunan Coordinate Defenses, Li Yangjing Presides Over Military Affairs in Eastern Guangdong, New Deployment of Defenses in Southern Jiangxi and Northern Guangdong, He Jian and Chen Jitang Meet in Dongchang <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>A Guangzhou correspondence reports that with the recent escalation of the Fujian incident, the defenses in eastern Guangdong are becoming increasingly tense. In order to facilitate military transportation in eastern Guangdong, the authorities have dispatched a transportation division of the headquarters to liaise with the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bureau to set up a Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Military Vehicle Management Office. Vehicles along the Shantou-Zhangzhou Highway will also be requisitioned for military use when necessary. Naval warships that previously arrived in Guangdong from Qingdao have also been ordered to allocate a certain vessel to patrol the sea near Shantou. Previously, the construction of trenches and fortifications along the Guangdong-Fujian border has been intensified. Chen Jitang has specially dispatched a German military advisor, along with several military commissioners, to depart for Shantou on the Haihu warship and then proceed to the front lines to make arrangements. Chen also plans to dispatch more than ten fighter planes to Chaozhou, Shantou, Meixian, and other places within the next few days, to be commanded by Fourth Squadron Leader Xie Meng and Fifth Squadron Leader Wu Jianwen. Li Yangjing is responsible for presiding over military affairs in eastern Guangdong. Li departed on the Guangzhou-Kowloon special train on the 27th and arrived in Huizhou that evening. He plans to arrive in Shantou on the afternoon of the 28th and then proceed to the front lines on the 29th to inspect everything in advance.</p>
<p>The authorities are also paying attention to the defenses in the northwest of Guangdong. However, since the eastward transfer of the Fourth Independent Division of the Northern Guangdong Army, only the Third Independent Division remains in northern Guangdong, and it also has to take care of the western Guangdong area. Therefore, in terms of the trend, if necessary, the First Army, which has long been suppressing bandits in southern Jiangxi, may be transferred back along the Yu-Xiong Road to strengthen the northern defenses. However, if the First Army is moved, the problem of filling the troop deployment in southern Jiangxi will arise temporarily. Therefore, there has recently been a meeting between He Jian and Chen Jitang in Dongchang. The current situation in the south has suddenly changed. Since Fujian has reached an agreement with Jiangxi, Fujian has no worries about its western flank. Its northward advance could probe Zhejiang, and its southward march could target Guangdong. Since Guangdong does not express sympathy, Fujian will inevitably regard it as a potential enemy. This is the main reason for the hasty military mobilization in eastern Guangdong these days. Moreover, if the situation on the Guangdong-Fujian border changes dramatically, the province that has a tacit understanding with Fujian will definitely exert pressure on Guangdong. Therefore, Guangdong had to first concentrate heavy troops in eastern Guangdong, and second, prepare to transfer the original troops stationed in southern Jiangxi back for defense, and also plan to ask the Hunan army to take care of southern Jiangxi, and plan to borrow the Hunan army to move south to help deal with everything. This is the reason why He and Chen met in Dongchang on the 23rd. After the two agreed on a meeting date, He, accompanied by two staff officers and more than 200 guards, traveled south by car from Changsha along the highway and arrived in Dongchang County, Guangdong, which borders Chenzhou in Hunan, on the 23rd. Chen Jitang took the Guangdong-Shaoguan railway train northward from Guangzhou at 11:30 PM on the 22nd. The only companions were Li Hanhun, the commander of the Third Independent Division, and a few guards. The train arrived in Shaoguan at around 5:00 AM on the 23rd. The Northwest District Pacification Commissioner's Office then dispatched a company of guards to escort Chen and others from Shaoguan to Dongchang. That day, He and Chen met at the Dongchang County government office. Both sides dismissed their attendants and held secret talks in the building of the Dongchang County government office. It is said that a solution has been reached regarding Hunan-Guangdong cooperation and military agreements. At noon, He and Chen toured the nearby Xiyan scenic spot together, and stayed overnight in Dongchang that evening. On the 24th, He Jian led his guards through Chenzhou back to Changsha. Chen Jitang also returned to Shaoguan, and took the Guangzhou-Shaoguan train on the 24th and returned to Guangzhou on the morning of the 25th. (November 28)</p>

<p>A Changsha correspondence reports that at the beginning of the Fujian disturbance, He Jian solemnly declared that he would unite with Guangdong and Guangxi to suppress bandits and, at the very least, maintain peace and security. Because there were many Social Democratic Party members lurking in Hunan Province, he strictly ordered his troops to take precautions. On November 21, he also rushed to Guangdong Province to discuss the joint suppression of bandits and the issue of dealing with the Fujian situation with Chen Jitang. He returned to Hunan on the evening of the 26th. On the 27th, he attended the weekly memorial service at Zhongshan Hall, reporting on the progress of the meeting in Guangdong, saying that the Fujian incident would not escalate and that he was optimistic about the situation. He also telegraphed Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi in Guangxi, agreeing to meet once in Yongzhou or Huangshahe. Li and Bai have replied, agreeing to come to Yongzhou for a meeting. They have asked He Jian to confirm the date so that they can set off. The telegram also expressed admiration for He's proposal to jointly suppress bandits. If the three provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi can unite, the situation will not have any special twists and turns. He also sent a telegram to Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, and others, advising them to turn back before it was too late. The telegram read: "Chen Zhenru, Li Renchao, Jiang Jingran, Cai Xianchu, and other brothers in Fuzhou, greetings. Reports state that you are now forming a separate government in Fuzhou, changing your banners, using Japanese funds and equipment. Instead of using troops to resist Japan, you are becoming pro-Japanese and forming a military agreement with the communists. Instead of using troops to suppress bandits, you are joining hands with bandits. The organizational choices are placing bandit leaders in key positions, calling it a 'proposal.' You are picking up the communist's leftover rhetoric. The news has spread and shocked the country. I believe that you gentlemen are historical figures in the country. The blood of the Songhu Battle has not yet dried, and the shame of Yanping is yet to be avenged. Once you are in a hurry and fail to choose, you are acting in reverse. Your character is completely lost, and who will trust you? Even if it is said that politics has not been perfect in recent years, and the central officials may not be able to fully satisfy people's expectations, you gentlemen are all important figures in the country and can only sincerely propose improvements. Now you have no good methods and willingly enter a wrong path, which I do not approve of. I, He Jian, have been brothers-in-arms with you gentlemen for a long time. At first, I suspected that the report was an exaggeration, so I delayed speaking. However, the repeated telegrams of condemnation have confirmed the matter. For the sake of the country and the nation, and for the sake of you gentlemen, I hope that you will change your minds and turn back before it is too late. Then, your past glorious history will still be visible to the eye. Even if the country is in turmoil, it will not be caused by you gentlemen and grow uncontrollably. Only good people can accept all advice. I hope you will consider it carefully. He Jian, with great concern." (November 29)</p>

<p>A Beiping correspondence reports that the Beiping Military Sub-Council held a regular meeting in Juren Hall at 10:00 AM yesterday. The attending members included Song Zheyuan, Jiang Bocheng, Shang Zhen, Cai Decun, Wang Shuchang, Bao Wenwei, Zou Zuohua, Wei Zonghan, Wei Yisan, Ji Yiqiao, Rong Zhen, and others, more than ten people in total. Deputy Chairman He Yingqin presided. After reporting important telegrams, they began to discuss the agenda. (1) Chairman Chiang proposed that Shen Zhenrong, the head of the Ninth Group, submit a plan for reducing the pay of the North China Army based on the resolution of the previous week's regular meeting: A) Starting from January of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), pay will be issued monthly, based on a monthly income of 4 million yuan. All lower-ranking officers and soldiers will be given increased benefits, in accordance with the current income, as a standard for issuing pay. It is estimated that 80-90% of the pay will be issued each month, while higher-ranking officers will only receive over 60% each month. If distributed evenly, each army will receive approximately 70% of its current amount. B) Public funds, miscellaneous expenses, provisions, compensation, and clothing for each army will also be issued monthly according to the prescribed amounts. After discussion, it was resolved to hand it over to the Finance and Supervision Committee for review and preparation of detailed measures, and to submit it for discussion at the next week's regular meeting. The date of the meeting of the Finance and Supervision Committee will be convened by Chairman He Yingqin at any time. (2) Zou Zuohua, the inspection commissioner of the Fourth Route of the Military Sub-Council, reported on the inspection of the troops stationed in the suburbs, assessing the performance of each army and the level of education and training. The other First Route (Tianjin-Pukou), Second Route (Beiping-Hankou), and Third Route (Beiping-Suiyuan) were limited to submitting reports by the 5th of next month by the heads of the inspection committees and the inspection directors, in order to convene a general meeting to review them. Then, each commissioner will formulate policies and measures, assess the advantages and disadvantages, and seek improvement. Those with excellent performance will be rewarded. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM.</p>
<p>Wan Fulin, the commander of the 53rd Army, received an urgent telegram from Chiang Kai-shek and boarded the 11th train of the Beiping-Hankou Railway at 12:30 PM yesterday, attached to a special car, and left Beiping southward to go to Hankou and then Jiangxi to meet Chiang, and then to Nanjing to meet Wang Zhaoming. He was accompanied by Wang Shuhan, a member of the Political Reorganization Committee, Ma Yucheng, the director of the Political Training Office, and more than 20 others. Before leaving, Wan made the following statement to reporters at the station: "I received an urgent telegram from Chairman Chiang to go to Jiangxi to inquire about the current situation in North China. I plan to stay in Nanchang for one to four days, and then leave Jiangxi for Nanjing to meet Premier Wang. Because Northeastern refugees are gathered in the Beiping-Tianjin area, they urgently need relief, and administrative officials also need to be settled. As a Northeastern general, it is difficult for me to remain indifferent to this. When I meet Wang, I plan to ask for relief for the Northeastern refugees in order to avoid destitution. Since the administrative officials of Northeasterners entering the customs are limited, I also ask for permission to publicly assign them to serve in other provinces." (November 29, Jin)</p>

<p>A Jinan correspondence reports that the third National Goods Exhibition and Auction held by the Shandong Provincial National Goods Exhibition Hall, which opened simultaneously on November 19, has been attracting a continuous stream of visitors to see and purchase national goods every day, reaching a temporary peak. The exhibition was scheduled for one month, and the auction was originally scheduled for five days. However, due to the large number of customers, it was extended for a week and ended today (30th). The hall held a closing meeting in the conference room today (30th), inviting merchants from all participating companies. More than 20 companies attended. Kong Lingyuan, the director of the hall, spoke, hoping that attendees could widely promote national goods anytime and anywhere, and invited other merchants to participate. The National Goods Exhibition Hall has decided to set up a sales department in the hall to solicit national goods stores from various places to send goods to the hall for consignment sales, in order to intensify the promotion of national goods. The method is that each merchant sends goods, and the hall sells them at the original wholesale price without adding any additional cost. The staff will be voluntarily provided by the hall, but 2% will be deducted as agency fees for paper, ink, and stamps. They are now actively preparing and are contacting merchants from various places. The start-up capital of more than 1,000 yuan has been raised by the hall. (November 30)</p>

<p>Wang Songliang, a 22-year-old employee of the gift department of the Shanghai Mei Ya Silk Factory, was from Fenglin, Wuxing. His brother, Zhongfu, also works in the dyeing department of the factory as an accountant. Wang Songliang had a dispute with his mother over a marriage issue. He left for Suzhou without saying goodbye on the 29th of last month. He initially stayed at the Xin Su Tai Hotel outside Guanmen. When he left, he left a note at home saying that if the marriage did not succeed, he vowed not to return home. After Songliang arrived in Suzhou, he wrote a letter to his mother, still asking for permission for the marriage. He then received a reply from his mother, saying that everything could be discussed, there was no need to do this, he could have his freedom, and that his brother was sick in Shanghai and he should come to Shanghai quickly to visit and return home together. Unexpectedly, on the 30th, Songliang went to the China Hotel, opened Room 13, using the alias Chen Shuying. At 12:00 PM on the night of the first, the tea server Luo Liangquan discovered that Songliang was behaving strangely, as if he was about to commit suicide. He reported to the police precinct, which sent a police officer to transfer him to the hospital for treatment. It was found that he had not yet taken poison.

<p>Outside Panmen Gate, the Sulun Cotton Mill employs over 4,000 workers, making it the largest factory in Suzhou. About half a month ago, workers such as Guo A'ren and 50 others jointly submitted a petition to the County Party Headquarters, requesting permission to establish the Wu County Cotton Weaving Labor Union. The County Party Headquarters immediately issued an order to investigate the matter before further processing. However, two weeks passed without any investigators being dispatched. The factory learned of this and dismissed Guo A'ren. On the 30th, over 20 workers, including Tang A'yao, went to the County Party Headquarters to state that the workers had no motive to organize a labor union and that there were other forces at play. On the afternoon of the 1st, over 30 workers went to the County Party Headquarters, requesting a prompt approval of the labor union to avoid exploitation by the capitalists. They claimed that Tang A'yao and others were instigated by the capitalists. The official Gao Ziyan received them and promised to convey their intentions to the committee members. The workers then dispersed. The committee members of the Party Headquarters had divergent opinions on the matter, leading to heated debates during meetings without any resolution. Fearing that reactionary elements might cause trouble, the Public Security Bureau dispatched a large number of secret agents to conduct discreet investigations near the factory.</p>

<p>As winter arrives and the weather becomes dry, fire alarms are frequently heard. Yesterday alone, two fires occurred. Investigations revealed the following: (1) At Xu Shuntai Carpentry Workshop, located north of Yongding Bridge at the foot of the West Gate city wall, Xu A'gen runs a prosperous business. Yesterday, around 7 PM, an apprentice was cooking dinner under the stove, accidentally setting fire to the accumulated firewood, causing an uncontrollable blaze. Soon, the flames lit up the sky and spread rapidly. The Ruduan Fire Brigade arrived and extinguished the fire. However, six single-story buildings were completely destroyed, resulting in losses of several thousand yuan. (2) Outside the North Gate, in the open space near the railway bridge behind the Xinshichang market, north of Yunong Bridge, there were 40-odd thatched huts. Last night, around 9 PM, a fire unexpectedly broke out in the home of Wang Xiaosanqian, spreading to neighboring huts and piercing through the roofs. Various fire brigades were alerted and rushed to the scene, putting out the fire. However, many thatched huts were reduced to ashes. (3) At Sun Yuanmao Rattan Shop, located in Xiaozhu Lane under the bridge outside the North Gate, a fire suddenly broke out around 1 PM. Flames roared and thick smoke filled the air. Qian Shixiong, the police chief of the 5th branch of the Public Security Bureau, noticed the fire while on patrol. He called for help from Zhu Dehuai and Liu Yongsheng, two officers on duty with him. They broke into the shop and tried their best to extinguish the fire, preventing a major disaster. Only a portion of the rattan was burned. During the fire at the thatched huts near the railway, the 2nd section fire brigade of Guangqin District and the 7th section fire brigade of Sibao Bridge clashed while fighting the fire. As a result, firemen Shen A'er and Da Juzi from the Guangqin District sustained serious injuries. Zhou Wuda and Chen Yuanfa from the North 7th section were also seriously injured. The Joint Fire Fighting Association convened a meeting between the two sides to mediate and urged them not to create further conflict. Furthermore, a member of the Zhongdong Fire Brigade, for unknown reasons, got into a fight with Wang Huchen, a police officer petitioning at the Zhongdong Theater. The officer was severely injured and sent to the Brothers Hospital for treatment; his life may be in danger. Also, when the thatched huts caught fire, the flames reached the iron and power lines, causing considerable damage, resulting in a disruption of long-distance telephone communication between Nanjing and Shanghai, which is currently being repaired.</p>

<p>Gao Wenchang, a third-class police officer stationed in Mocheng, Changshu, was from Shandong Province and was 35 years old. His younger brother, Gao Wenqing, served as a squad leader on a patrol ship in Changshu Town. Seven months ago, he was introduced by his elder brother to the police force as a probationary officer, and was officially made a third-class police officer just one week ago. Wenchang previously served in the military. Now stationed in Mocheng, he was often depressed due to financial difficulties. At noon on the first of this month, Gao Wenchang was on guard duty when he took the 7.9mm rifle he was holding, loaded a bullet, and committed suicide by pulling the trigger with his foot. The bullet entered his mouth and exited through his head, causing his teeth to fall out and his skull to explode, a truly horrific sight. The squad leader investigated the situation and determined that it was due to financial distress. He immediately reported it to the team headquarters and Gao Wenqing, his younger brother, and reported the case to the county government, who sent personnel to the countryside to investigate.</p>

<p>In Hengjing Sijing Township, the third district, there is a widow named Shen Laotai, who is over fifty years old and has neither children nor many relatives. She recently sold unpolished rice and obtained 132 yuan. She lent out 100 yuan at interest, which was discovered by bandits. On the night of the 30th, more than ten bandits broke into Shen's home and searched for valuables, finding only 32 yuan and 200 copper coins. They then demanded to know where the remaining 100 yuan was hidden. Shen said she had lent it to someone else, but the bandits did not believe her. They used scissors to stab the old woman's left wrist, causing her to fall to the ground unconscious. The bandits then fled. The next morning, the local police team was informed. After investigating the situation, it appeared to be the work of local people. Suspects Jin Yinsheng and Shen Yishun were arrested and taken to the county for questioning on the 2nd.</p>

<p>Xie Yingzheng, the district chief of the 19th district of Wu County, upon noticing a series of robberies occurring within his jurisdiction, immediately directed the police and militia to conduct a thorough investigation. On the 28th of last month, they spotted Jiang Songgao, a resident of Tangshang, whose clothes were stained with blood and whose behavior was suspicious. They apprehended him, brought him in, and interrogated him. He confessed to participating in the robberies. On the 29th, they also apprehended robbers Zhu Fugeng and Lin Yuetang. District Chief Xie, together with the chief of the Xiaohe Public Security Branch, interrogated them strictly. The robbers confessed to robbing the homes of Shen Jinkou in Luoxiangli, Chen Hongfan in Jifu Township, and Sun Zhailong, and to spending the stolen goods. District Chief Xie and others continued to search for the remaining members of the gang. Yesterday (the 1st), they came to the county government to report the case and handed over the captured criminals to the county for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Jiashan Madman Kills Mother and Sister <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>On the night of the 30th, a shocking incident occurred in Xigangtou, Xiadianmiao, in this county, where a madman brutally killed his mother and sister, drawing widespread attention. The details are as follows: In Xigangtou, there is a madman named Wang Aqi. His father, Dada, died early. His mother, Jiang, is 69 years old. Jiang had six children. The eldest daughter, Lanbao (one of the deceased), was 38 years old and married Yu Amao of Xicun. After her husband's death, she lived with her mother and helped with household chores. The second daughter is married to Xu Awu. The third son, Jinsheng, is 29 years old and married. The fourth son is Aqi, 25 years old, who is married to a woman surnamed Tang but has no children. The fifth son, Adi, and the sixth son, Qiuquan, are both young. They are farmers and make kiln blanks as a side business. The family is very poor. However, starting from his grandfather, the family has had a history of mental illness, although not very severe. This condition was inherited through three generations, becoming worse in Aqi's case. Aqi was quite sincere and diligent after his marriage four years ago. Unexpectedly, he suddenly developed madness the following year. Initially, it was mild, occurring intermittently. At the same time, his third elder brother, Jinsheng, and his eldest sister, Lanbao, also suffered from the same illness. As a result, three madmen lived under one roof, causing unrest. The two younger brothers and the daughter-in-law, Tang, moved to relatives' homes, leaving only the old mother and sister Lanbao to manage the household. In recent days, Aqi's madness has worsened. He claimed to be possessed by a high-ranking official, talking nonsense incessantly. Sometimes, he would wield a kitchen knife randomly, causing everyone to run away. Before long, Lanbao became bedridden due to illness, and the old mother was tending to her by her side. Who knew that a tragic incident would occur at this time? On the night of the 30th, Aqi suddenly grabbed a stone hammer and rushed to Lanbao's bedside, killing Lanbao. He then grabbed his old mother, stuffed her mouth with bamboo chopsticks and a scrubbing brush to prevent her from making noise, and then repeatedly struck her with the hammer. He dragged her to the riverbank and pushed her into the river. At that time, dawn was approaching. Knowing he had committed a crime, the madman fled far away. On the morning of the 1st, men and women from far and near gathered, and they found the body of a woman lying on the ground, with many severe injuries to her head, waist, and chest, and blood everywhere. At the same time, they found a floating female body at the mouth of Shatuo Port, which was the madman's mother, Jiang. The scene was extremely cruel. After committing the crime, the madman fled to the home of his sister's husband, Xu Awu, in Poxuegang. He was apprehended by the captain of the local security team, Lv Huanchen, and imprisoned in heavy shackles. He was still babbling and constantly mentioning the high-ranking official. Captain Lv reported the case to the court, while the local community reported it to the court, requesting an autopsy.</p>

<p>After opening the meeting and observing customary rituals, Chairman Lu Jingshi reported that the Shanghai citizens' rally to condemn the rebels was being held today, with enthusiastic participation from citizens from all sectors of agriculture, industry, commerce, and education, demonstrating a shared spirit of indignation and hatred. He noted that today, the nation is facing a grave crisis with internal and external pressures. The international situation is becoming increasingly tense. China should strive to develop its national strength, eliminate bandits, and engage in production in order to avoid the disaster of national subjugation. Although differing political views are common, in the face of great difficulties, we must set aside minor grievances and jointly undertake major tasks. However, Chen Mingshu and others have brazenly betrayed the nation and the people, mixing in with all reactionary elements such as the Third Party, the Social Democratic Party, the BA Group, and the Nationalist faction, establishing a false government, turning from resisting Japan to being pro-Japan, and from suppressing the communists to collaborating with them, acting as tools for red and white imperialists to damage the national foundation. The so-called People's Government is just as comical as the puppet regime in Manchukuo. Since the incident, the Communist Party, which is deeply hated by the Chinese people, has openly filled Fujian Province, engaged in red terror, deprived the people of all freedoms, and created war. As a result, the people's suffering has deepened and the nation's international standing has declined. Their betrayal of the country and harm to the people is greater than anyone else. The 19th Route Army has destroyed its former glorious history and its oath not to participate in the civil war, which we deeply regret. Now that Chen's rebellion is evident, the people of the whole country must unanimously condemn it and quickly quell the rebellion in order to save the Party and the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Summary of Speeches <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Next, Tao Baichuan delivered a speech, stating that today's Shanghai citizens' rally to condemn the rebels has two goals: First, to deny the legitimacy of the People's Government; and second, to overthrow the rebellious party and the traitors. The People's Government, as its name suggests, should be organized by the people, but it is only supported by a small number of people. What we need now is (1) Peace, so that all sectors of agriculture, industry, commerce, and education can live and work in peace; (2) Unity, so that the nation can become strong under a unified government; (3) Construction, to achieve national revival; (4) Suppression of bandits, as the false government in Fujian is actively colluding with communist bandits; and (5) Resistance to Japan, to seek national survival. If these five goals are not vigorously pursued, the rebels will undoubtedly engage in sabotage. Therefore, we must eliminate the People's Government and destroy the 19th Route Army. Lu Wenshao then gave a speech, stating that the 19th Route Army, which was once admired by all sectors as a national hero, is now forcibly organizing a People's Government in Fujian, causing military disaster and undermining unity. The citizens of Shanghai should vigorously support the central government and eliminate the rebels in order to seek happiness for the people. Next, the Fujian Provincial Alliance to Protect the Party and Condemn the Rebels (Gan Yun) spoke, stating that the People's Government of Fujian destroyed the Party's national flag and the leader's portrait, which is extremely heartbreaking. We must only fight against the rebels in order to protect this revolutionary history.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Resolutions Passed <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The following resolutions were passed at the meeting: (1) To send telegrams nationwide unanimously condemning the illegal organization in Fujian. Resolution: Passed. (2) To advise the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army to quickly awaken and return to the right path, so as to avoid mutual destruction. Resolution: Passed.

(6) Recently, some people have attempted to take advantage of the serious situation to brew a third political power. This meeting should warn them and urge them to reflect on their actions. Resolution: Passed. (7) Li Liejun, as a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee, has made erroneous remarks. We should request the central government to severely punish him and arrest the Social Democratic Party spy, Duan, and others. Resolution: Passed. (8) To telegraph Chairman Chiang, urging him to instruct all the bandit suppression generals to work hard to encircle and suppress the bandits in order to achieve complete success. Resolution: Passed. (9) The meeting issued a declaration. Resolution: Passed.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Meeting Declaration <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>To be forwarded by various newspapers to all compatriots across the country for your public knowledge. When red bandits ran rampant and strong neighbors invaded, the nation and the people were in a perilous state. The central government, after much deliberation, deeply understood that it was necessary to first secure the interior before resisting foreign aggression and that there was no way to save the nation without suppressing the bandits. Therefore, the military was reorganized and a large-scale campaign was launched. Now that the long-standing threat of the bandits entering Jiangxi had been cleared and the sweeping operation was expected to be completed, it was thought that the nation's future would be revealed. Unexpectedly, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, Chen Youren, and others, being mad and depraved, took advantage of the nation's internal and external troubles, colluding with corrupt elements such as the Social Democratic Party, the Third Party, the Nationalist faction, the Communist Party, and old warlords to organize the so-called Production Party and People's Revolutionary Government in Fuzhou, abolishing the national title, changing the national emblem without authorization, and openly betraying the Party and the nation. The news of this rebellious act filled us with pain and indignation. Chen, Li, and others, as members of the Kuomintang Central Committee or holding important government positions, should be setting an example and dedicating themselves to the Party and the nation at this time of serious national crisis when the whole country is working together to suppress the bandits. Instead, they have become insane and are acting against the tide, doing things that are neither donkey nor horse. The content is even more complex and bizarre. Knowing that the name "Communist Party" is unacceptable to the people of the country, they changed the "Communist" character to the "Production" character in order to disguise themselves. Knowing that their internal structure is complex and that the old warlords' political views in the Nationalist faction conflict with the Social Democratic Party, the Third Party, and the Communist Party, they lump them together under the name of the Production Party in order to make it up. However, in reality, they do everything to unite with the communists and collaborate with the enemy. In terms of uniting with the communists, they have entered into a non-aggression pact with the bandit party, providing the bandits with military supplies and resources. In terms of collaborating with the enemy, they use Han Binli, an Anfu general who strongly supported Nishihara loans, to cross the sea and collude with Japanese warlords. They also appointed Chen Youren, who had visited Shidehara and sold out the Northeast, to preside over the false government's foreign affairs. Uniting with the communists and collaborating with the enemy means abandoning the national stance and violating the interests of the nation. Chen, Li, and others shamelessly call themselves anti-Japanese and bandit suppression, feigning bandit suppression while compromising with the bandits, and feigning resistance against Japan while colluding with Japan, recognizing the thief as their father and turning against their benefactors. If the rebellious lives of Chen, Li, and others are prolonged and their treacherous conspiracy succeeds, not only will Fujian become a continuation of Taiwan, but our entire nation and all of our people will be doomed to an eternal abyss. The rebellious acts of Chen, Li, and others are moths of the Party in the Party, traitors of the nation in the nation, public enemies of the people, and criminals of the nation, whose crimes are worse than traitors and disasters are worse than red bandits. We, the citizens of the entire city, uphold the principle of not coexisting with bandits, and therefore hold this meeting to condemn and punish them. In addition to appealing to the central government to issue a clear order to suppress them, we also hope that compatriots across the country will maintain their usual enthusiasm for supporting the Party and the nation and unanimously condemn and punish them. The nation's future depends on this. We hereby declare this.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Collection of Telegrams <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>"Punitive Telegram Regarding Fujian" - To all newspaper offices, all organizations, all groups, and compatriots at home and abroad: Since Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others incited the Fujian Incident, all those with blood in their veins have felt deep indignation. At a time when national crisis deepens and the foundation of the nation is shaky, we barely have time for unity and defense. How dare these traitors take the opportunity to rebel, organize a false government, act like monkeys in hats, usurp the national flag, and presumptuously change the national system, not hesitating to sacrifice the Republic of China, which was painstakingly built by martyrs, to satisfy the selfish ambitions of a few? Their crimes are indeed worse than those of Zhang Xun and Yuan Shikai, and their shamelessness is even greater than that of the false organizations outside the Pass. They started by calling for the suppression of bandits, but ended up colluding with bandits to secure themselves. They started by raising funds in the name of resisting Japan, but ended up fawning on Japan and selling out the country. Their despicable and rogue behavior, even if Wu Sangui and Shi Jingtang were resurrected to emulate them, they would probably sigh in admiration and admit their inferiority. These traitors occupy Fujian Province and exploit the people of Fujian. The elders of the eight Fujian prefectures all hate them deeply and gnash their teeth, wishing for their mutual destruction. Now they persist in their evil ways, becoming even more reckless. Not content with causing disaster in Fujian, they want to spread their ferocious flames and bring disaster to the entire nation. Not content with harming the people themselves, they want to collude with the Red bandits to exterminate our nation. Can their hearts be questioned? Is their flesh still edible? If they are not suppressed as soon as possible, it will inevitably lead to the disaster of national subjugation and racial extermination. All citizens of Shanghai, holding the principle of "I will not coexist with bandits," convened a general meeting and unanimously decided to denounce their crimes and demand their punishment, vowing not to live under the same sky with them. In addition to constantly requesting the central government to swiftly punish them to uphold the law, we dare to expose their treacherous plans and inform the world. We hope that compatriots at home and abroad will rise up together to condemn and punish them and be the government's support, annihilating this group of demons. The future of the nation and the people truly depends on this. The Shanghai Citizens' Punitive Traitors' Assembly bows in winter and unanimously sends the following telegram to the central government: "To the Nanjing National Government: Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and other rebels, taking advantage of the serious national crisis, used the 19th Route Army to seize Fujian, start a rebellion, presumptuously change the national system, spread false doctrines, hoping to communize all of Fujian, and even collude with bandits to secure themselves. Shamelessly serving Japan, they do not hesitate to recognize the thief as their father and sell out the country. In terms of crimes, Yuan Shikai and Zhang Xun were not as ferocious and stubborn as them. Shi Jingtang and Wu Sangui were less shameless than them. If they are not punished, how can there be justice in the world? If they are not诛, how can the country survive? We respectfully request that the government rectify the army, swiftly punish them, raze their courts, and annihilate this group of demons, without again tolerating evil and letting it spread, causing endless disaster to the nation and the people. This would be extremely fortunate. The Shanghai Citizens' Punitive Traitors' Assembly bows in winter." "Telegram to Central Committee Members in Various Places" - To all newspaper offices, Mr. Hu Zhantang in Hong Kong, Mr. Feng Huanzhang in Mount Tai, Mr. Xiao Focheng in Guangzhou, Mr. Li Xiehe in Shanghai, and all Central Committee members: The Fujian Incident is becoming more urgent, the national situation is deteriorating, and people are panicking, unable to live in peace. This is a critical moment for the party and the country. It is not a time for you to enjoy leisure and remain aloof. We hope you will consider the heavy responsibility entrusted to you by the nation and the people's earnest expectations. Please promptly gather with Central Committee members scattered in various places in the capital to jointly discuss national affairs, quell the rebellion, and consolidate the foundation of the nation. This is the right time. If you merely engage in empty talk and insist on being high-minded, not only will you ruin the country with empty talk and be unable to escape the ridicule of future generations, but also, under an overturned nest, will you have any remaining place to exist? We urgently submit these words, hoping for your understanding. The Shanghai Citizens' Punitive Traitors' Assembly bows in winter.</p>

<p>Yesterday at the Citizens' Assembly, the American Fox Film Company specially sent three photographers with cameras to the scene to shoot news footage. When filming began, Chairman Lu Jingshi was reporting, and the crowd was surging with national flags waving and emotions were heated. When it is sent to various places for screening in the future, people will be able to see the attention of the Shanghai citizens to the Fujian rebellion.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Sun Ke Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning - Says Political Solution to Fujian Incident is Hopeless - Central Government's Choice of Personnel to Go South is Undecided - Implementing Open Governance is Not Far Off <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai by night train from Nanjing at 7:30 yesterday morning. Legislative Yuan members Ma Chaojun, Fu Rulin, Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiayi, Vice Minister of Industry Liu Weizhi, Director of the Health Department Liu Ruiheng, and others also arrived in Shanghai on the same train. After getting off the train, Sun returned directly to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest, and then met with reporters from various newspapers. The content of his conversation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e143">Political Solution Is Out of the Question <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Sun said that the central government originally intended to resolve the Fujian Incident through political means and was unwilling to resort to military force lightly. However, based on the current situation, a political solution is out of the question. The military aspect also depends on the situation. The central government troops in Zhejiang are temporarily adopting a defensive posture. If Fujian attacks Zhejiang, then war is inevitable. Otherwise, if Fujian does not invade Zhejiang, then a temporary truce is possible. However, it is uncertain whether there will be other solutions in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e144">No News of Hu's Forming a Government <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>When reporters asked about the attitude of Guangdong and Guangxi and the rumor that Hu Hanmin was forming a new government, Sun said that the attitude of Guangdong and Guangxi was as reported in the newspapers. As for Hu Hanmin forming a third government, he had not heard of it. But the country has reached this point, and further division is unacceptable.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Open Governance is Not Far Off <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>It was reported that Central Committee members staying in Shanghai, such as Mr. Li Liejun, had contributed a proposal for reforming the central government's politics to the authorities, but Nanjing had not seen any suggestions from Li and others, so it was not discussed. Even regarding Li's proposal for open governance, everyone agrees. On the central government's side, it was decided long ago to convene a National Assembly in the 24th year of the Republic of China, promulgate a constitution, and publicly open governance, which is not far off.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Personnel to Go to Hong Kong Are Hard to Find <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The central government originally intended to send personnel to Hong Kong to meet with Mr. Hu Zhantang to exchange views first, and then discuss solutions. However, due to the difficulty of choosing personnel, it has not been implemented yet. It is rumored that Zhang Ji, Dai Jitao, Chen Lifu, etc. are being considered. Except that Zhang is still considering, the rumors about Dai and Chen are definitely not true. Even if personnel are sent, it is feared that there will be no concrete solutions temporarily. Because of the numerous affairs of the Legislative Yuan, he has decided not to go.

<p>According to the Far East News Agency, since the Fujian Incident occurred, it has been rumored that the 19th Route Army has transferred all the troops stationed in western Fujian to northern and eastern Fujian, indicating that they have no intention of using troops against Guangdong and will fully attack Zhejiang. At the same time, there was news of contact on the front lines. There was also a rumor that Hu Hanmin, Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi of Guangxi, You Guocai of Guizhou, and others were planning a new organization. A Far East News Agency reporter visited a Central Committee member yesterday and asked about these two rumors. According to him, although Fujian is currently actively</p>

<p>The replenishment of military supplies is by no means something that can be accomplished overnight. Even if they have some strength, compared with those who have real power in the country, they are like a minor wizard seeing a major wizard. Moreover, with the central government's army blocking them in front and the elite troops of Guangdong guarding their rear, they will definitely not act rashly before they have a firm grasp of the situation. The rumors that there has been contact on the front lines in recent days are premature. However, since Chen Mingshu and his ilk dared to change the era name, abandon the party, and commit great disrespect by establishing an independent government, they would not rashly do so if they were not</p>

<p>Moreover, the 19th Route Army is willing to wager its precious and glorious history on a single throw of the dice and cannot be regarded as blindly following. They must intend to achieve something, and it is only a matter of time. Just as they replied to Hu Hanmin in their telegram, "Success or failure, profit or loss, we have long ceased to care." Regarding Hu Hanmin, Li Bai, and others in Guangdong</p>

<p>There has been no news of this. It is speculated that Hu, indicating that he cannot implement his proposals, will neither enter Nanjing nor Fujian, and will not agree with hypocrisy. Then why stay in Hong Kong? Therefore, the rumor of forming another government has arisen. In reality, these are all speculations and cannot be</p>

The Zhongshan, Yixian, Yongxu, Chujian, Jiangyuan, and other five ships have been ordered by the Torpedo Boat Fleet Commander Wang Shouting to depart from Sandu'ao to various Fujian seaports, such as Xiamen and Minjiang, to inspect merchant ships entering and leaving the ports to prevent military supplies and food from being supplied to Fujian. The Jardine Matheson Company's Hengsheng Steamer, which sailed from Shanghai to Fuzhou the day before yesterday, was inspected by the Navy after passing through the mouth of the Minjiang River and still sailed peacefully into Fuzhou. However, the Haining gunboat remained stationed in Sandu'ao.</p>

<p>The Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance held its daily executive committee meeting at No. 4 Hong Kong Road at 2 PM the day before yesterday. Wang Xiaogan, Lin Mihou, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiqi, Chen Shuqing, Chen Liting, Yan Esheng, and Lin Kang attended, with the latter presiding. The secretariat first reported on the letters received by the association after the start of the incident. Then, the meeting discussed ways to stop the Fujian Incident from escalating into war and decided on various measures to be implemented separately. First, telegrams were sent to the central government, Chiang Kai-shek, and Cai Tingkai, urging them to avoid the use of force. The telegrams were sent out that day. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e158">Telegram to the Central Government <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>To the Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan Military Affairs Commission: The sudden outbreak of the crisis is heartbreaking for the whole country. The central government has the responsibility to protect unity. However, the Fujian incident is a political dispute, and the handling of it should still be lenient. We earnestly hope that you will adhere to the original intention of a political solution and find a way to mediate, so as to avoid disasters for the people. We respectfully pray, Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance bows, East.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Telegram to Chiang Kai-shek and Cai Tingkai <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>To Mr. Chiang Kai-shek and Mr. Cai Tingkai in Fuzhou: We sent a telegram to you before the imminent breakout of the Fujian Incident, but we have not received a reply. Now, it is rumored that the situation has worsened, and there are rumors of troops heading north. The people of the whole country are panicked and horrified. They all believe that the glorious reputation of the 19th Route Army in resisting Japan has been sacrificed in internal strife, which is very regrettable. In the past, the start of civil wars was always preceded by written debates and differences in political views, which served as their guide. This time, however, it happened in an instant, and there was no way to prevent it. You two gentlemen are far-sighted and should be able to discern that such recklessness and disorder, lacking the support of neighboring regions and losing the sympathy of the people, cannot possibly succeed. Once war breaks out, it will only bring suffering to the people and nurture evil. We hope you will consider carefully, stop the war, and let all problems be solved politically, so as not to please the onlookers and rejoice the enemies. We offer our sincere advice, hoping that you will accept it. Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance bows, East.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Three Unified Taxes Increased - To Be Implemented from the 5th <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Ta Kung Pao says: The Ministry of Finance believes that the national treasury is currently in deficit, and major construction projects and the suppression of bandits all require large amounts of funds. In order to make overall plans, it is proposed to increase the unified taxes on cement, matches, and cigarettes appropriately. The proposal has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for a meeting and approved. It is scheduled to be implemented uniformly from the 5th of this month. The Taxation Department has already notified various merchants. The revised new tax rules obtained by the Ta Kung Pao reporter are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e163">Cigarettes <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>For domestically produced paper cigarettes, those with a selling price of more than 300 yuan per 50,000 cigarettes will be in the first class and will be taxed at 160 yuan. Those with a selling price of less than 300 yuan per 50,000 cigarettes will be in the second class and will be taxed at 80 yuan. The highest selling price for the second class may be relaxed by 20 yuan if it is not the location of the cigarette factory, that is, the highest selling price per box in other cities must not exceed 320 yuan. There is no limit to the highest selling price for the first class. This new tax rate will be implemented on December 5th of this year. From that date, domestically produced paper cigarettes will not be allowed to leave the factory without new tax stamps. Cigarettes that have left the factory with old tax stamps before November 5th will still be allowed to be sold uniformly. The old tax stamps purchased and stored by various cigarette companies should be exchanged for new stamps at the price within 30 days of the implementation of the tax increase.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Matches <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>

<h3 id="e166">Cigarette Industry Petitions for Postponement of Tax Increase <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The local cigarette factories believe that private cigarettes are spreading widely in various provinces, and the government has not yet taken measures to rectify the situation, but has issued an order to increase taxes, which will be implemented on the 5th of this month. Those with a selling price of more than 300 yuan per 50,000 cigarettes will be in the first class and will be taxed at 160 yuan. Those with a selling price of more than 300 yuan per 50,000 cigarettes will be in the Class Cigarettes and will be taxed at 80 yuan. Each cigarette factory believes that as the tax rate increases, private cigarettes will also become more prevalent, and cigarette merchants' businesses will feel even more distressed. Therefore, the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry Association held a meeting for discussion. It was decided that the government should be asked to review the current state of the cigarette industry, first clear out private cigarettes to avoid infringing on legitimate businesses, and the new cigarette tax rate should be postponed. When private cigarettes are eliminated in the future, the tax increase will be discussed again. Lao Jingxiu, Ding Boquan, Shen Xingde, Bao Yingsheng, and Wu Linzhi were elected as petition representatives. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the representatives first went to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to request support for the petition to the financial authorities to postpone the implementation of the new tax. Tong Fuhui, the representative of the foreign cigarette factory, also went to the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance to petition. The petition is recorded as follows: I am writing to inform you that we received a public letter from the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance on the 1st of this month, stating that the Ministry of Finance has ordered that the national treasury is currently in deficit, and major construction projects and the suppression of bandits all require large amounts of funds. The tax rate of the cigarette unified tax in our country is still low, and it should be appropriately increased. All paper cigarettes made by the state with a selling price of more than 300 yuan per 50,000 cigarettes will be in the first class and will be taxed at 160 yuan. All paper cigarettes made by the state with a selling price of less than 300 yuan per 50,000 cigarettes will be in the first class and will be taxed at 80 yuan. The right to increase taxes is indeed in the hands of the government, but the business of merchants should not be infringed upon, which is also the government's responsibility. At present, private cigarettes are rampant and spreading widely. In these three years, their monthly sales have increased from one or two boxes to more than ten thousand boxes, and there is a tendency to increase day by day. However, the government has not taken effective measures to suppress and rectify these tax-evading cigarettes, which has damaged the legitimate businesses of cigarette merchants and caused them to decline day by day. We seek relief, but instead, we are issued a tax increase order, which will cause cigarette merchants' businesses to stagnate invisibly. As the tax rate increases, private cigarettes will also become more prevalent, and the businesses of legitimate cigarette merchants will also decline further. Therefore, the government will start by increasing taxes and end up by reducing taxes, causing both the public and private sectors to suffer and not benefiting the real situation. Therefore, in order to make overall plans, we should first formulate regulations for rectifying private cigarettes and carry out rectification first. After private cigarettes are brought under control, we can discuss the tax increase again. Then the businesses of cigarette merchants will not be infringed upon, and even if the tax rate increases gradually, they will be able to bear it. Otherwise, if the businesses are dying, even the government's tax revenue will decrease as a result, which is not a good way for both parties. If the government needs funds urgently and must increase taxes, it also needs to examine the current state of the cigarette industry and increase the rate appropriately, so that the tax revenue will improve and there will be no damage to the business, so that the national economy and the people's livelihood will benefit from it. Our association, in response to the requests of various associations, has specially dispatched Lao Jingxiu, Ding Boquan, Shen Xingde, Bao Yingsheng, and Wu Linzhi as representatives to send a copy of the petition to the Ministry of Finance. We respectfully petition your department (association), hoping that the director (association) will show sympathy for the merchants' difficulties and promptly forward to the Ministry of Finance that all newly ordered cigarette tax rates should be implemented after redrawing and rectifying private cigarettes, so as to maintain the business of cigarette merchants. This is a public petition. Ministry of Finance Taxation Department, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry Association, December 2, 22.</p>

<p>According to Shanghai Fujian Xu Jigong, Dong Jianzhong, etc., in order to respond to the efforts of overseas Chinese to save their hometown, a meeting was held with fellow villagers at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 2:30 PM yesterday. More than 80 people attended, including Liu Chengcan, Chen Wulie, Wu Yuwen, Lin Shihui, Wang Zhonglin, and Xie Nanguang. Chairman Xu Jigong first reported that since the Red Bandits invaded Fujian in the 20th year of the Republic of China, Fujian Overseas Chinese Rescue Associations have been organized in French Annam, Dutch Java, Batavia, British Malaya, etc. In order to coordinate the efforts of overseas Chinese and expand the hometown rescue movement, we specially ask you to discuss the measures together. The following resolutions were made: (1) To organize the "Fujian Overseas Chinese Rescue Association" and elect 11 executive committee members. As a result, Xu Jigong, Huang Jianzhong, Qiu Zansheng, Wu Yuwen, Wang Zhonglin, Chen Wulie, Liu Chengcan, Li Denghui, Lin Shizhong, Zhang Xuan, and Wu Yingpei were elected as executive committee members. Xie Denan, Zhang Diming, and Xie Nanguang were elected as alternate executive committee members. (2) To publish a telegram. It was decided to hand it over to the executive committee members for handling. (3) To schedule the first executive committee meeting. It was decided to hold it on December 4th. (4) To publish a declaration. The "Fujian Overseas Chinese Rescue Association Declaration" was approved. "We, the people of Fujian, have suffered from natural and man-made disasters in recent years. Although we are living an inhuman life, we still want to be "human." Especially in the current serious situation, if we, the people of Fujian, want to survive and enjoy, we must first ask ourselves if we want to be human and whether we want to clean up the gathering place for being human. The will of the people is the power of society. The chaos in society depends entirely on whether the people have healthy power to eliminate it. The reason why Fujian has suffered so much in recent years is due to the corruption of warlords and communists. However, the lack of unity among the people of Fujian is also to blame. The people of Fujian in the past, although in deep water and scorching fire, could still find a way to survive. But now, the people of Fujian are about to face the crisis of the collapse of their hometown and the destruction of their families, and there is no way to survive. Should we just sit and wait for death? Especially we, the Fujian Overseas Chinese who are away from our hometown, feel even more desolate. The 19th Army, the hero of the Anti-Japanese War, is the army that we, the Fujian Overseas Chinese, love the most. We warmly welcome the 19th Army to build a new Fujian and to relieve the suffering of the people of Fujian. We did not expect that the 19th Army would give Fujian the policy of destroying Fujian and harming the people. We sincerely welcome the 19th Army to eliminate the communists in Fujian Province and to protect the livelihood of the people of Fujian. We did not expect that the 19th Army would be used by the communists to create a "People's Government." Is this the original public opinion of our 50 million people of Fujian? Is this the goal of our 50 million people of Fujian who are looking for governance? Today, we, the Fujian Overseas Chinese, are at the line of survival. Under the corruption of the warlords, all those who want to be human should take the responsibility of being human, combine the healthy power of the people of Fujian Province to eliminate the so-called "People's Government" that cooperates with the communists, awaken the 19th Army that is being used by the communists, engage in practical autonomous hometown rescue work, a practical autonomous Fujian rescue movement, thoroughly improve the Fujian government, and unite to reverse the crisis. We, the people of Fujian, cannot be puppets of a few politicians, and our Fujian cannot be a testing ground for private civil wars. This is the meaning of the organization of the Fujian Overseas Chinese Rescue Association. We sincerely hope that the central government will make an early decision on a plan to quell the chaos, so that the Fujian crisis will not last long and expand, and the people of Fujian will not be forever trapped in a fire pit. We also hope that the elders at home and abroad will not hold non-Fujianese views, watch the fire from across the shore, and avoid the sadness of the dying fox. We hope that you will all understand. Present this to the association, which we have high hopes for."</p>

<h3 id="e174">After Jin Xi Was Arrested, His Family Submitted Nationality Certificates; Three Lawyers Were Hired to Handle Legal Procedures <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>On October 5 of the eighteenth year of the Republic, Jin Xi, along with his father Jin Yongduo (also known as Jin Che), naturalized as Chinese citizens and obtained Chinese nationality. On the afternoon of the twelfth day of last month, at around 6:00 PM, he left home, saying he was going to meet a friend, but did not return that night. The next day, his family learned that he had been arrested by police dispatched by the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai in the French Concession. Citizens of this city, including Li Songnian, Yang Shichang, and Zhang Yiqing, argued that since Jin Xi had acquired Chinese nationality, the French Concession police authorities should provide him with legal protection. They also sent letters to legal entities such as the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association to jointly protest and demand that the municipal government conduct a stern negotiation. The municipal government stated that it needed to first verify whether Jin Xi had indeed acquired Chinese nationality before it could proceed. Now, Jin Xi's family has hired three lawyers, Huai Yunmei, Gong Jie, and Luo Zhaoxin, to handle the legal procedures, and has submitted a copy of Jin Xi's naturalization certificate. From this, it can be known that Jin Xi is indeed of Chinese nationality and should receive the protection of Chinese law. His arrest without cause not only harms his personal legal rights, but also infringes on the sovereignty of our country. It is heard that legal entities in this city will exert their utmost efforts to protest.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Prince Singh of Nepal, who recently arrived in Shanghai, delivered a speech at the YMCA in Baixianqiao the night before last (the 1st) on "Humanitarianism and World Peace." Yesterday at noon, former Nepalese envoy Zhang Ming hosted a farewell banquet at the Dadong Restaurant. During the banquet, Prince Singh expressed that two years ago, Nepal and Tibet had a misunderstanding, almost leading to war. Fortunately, Envoy Zhang went to assist and explained to Grand Marshal Xiang, averting the war. This time, he came to China and unfortunately witnessed the outbreak of the Fujian Incident, and felt great regret at seeing such a division. Therefore, he will send a telegram to President Wang and Chairman Jiang, requesting permission to go to Fujian to persuade Chen and Li, among others, to abolish the puppet government. He also stated that if this ambition is not achieved, he is willing to go to the front lines himself, live amidst the artillery fire, and spare no effort to strive for China's peace and unification.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Central Government Plans to Ban Reading Magazine <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing News: The Central Propaganda Department believes that the Reading magazine published by a certain Shanghai publishing house is a publication of the Social Democratic Party, propagating radical ideas and anesthetizing young people. Hu Qiuyuan and others currently serving in Fujian are the magazine's editors. It is planned to ban the magazine immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Major Lee Fray of the American Relief Effort, Who Exerted the Most Effort to Aid Chinese Disasters, Has Passed Away; A Great Loss for Chinese Disaster Victims <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, the American Advisory Committee for Disaster Relief in this city received a telegram from New York today (the 2nd) stating that Major Lee Fray, who exerted the most effort in the United States to raise donations to aid Chinese disasters, suddenly passed away in New York on the 30th of last month. Since 1928, Lee has served as the National Director of the American Committee for Relief in China. The committee is located on East 41st Street in New York. Although it is headed by Bai Huairen, who previously visited China to inspect the disaster situation, all fundraising matters are planned and executed by Lee. Therefore, he was recognized as the brains and power of the committee. During this time of economic decline in the United States, without Lee's enthusiastic fundraising efforts, it would have been difficult to obtain so many donations that flowed into China. For example, in the most recent two months, the committee remitted money to the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association four times, each time with US$5,000, which was also the result of Lee's leadership. His death is not only a loss to the world and philanthropists, but also a loss of a good friend to countless disaster victims in China.</p>

All provincial and municipal governments are to be notified for their information, and all relevant departments are to be notified to disseminate the information.

<p>The founders of the Hongkou People's Obstetrics Hospital, including Du Yuesheng, Gu Shaoqing, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Boyuan, and Weng Guoxun, are sparing no effort to protect the health of the common people. Recently, due to the domestic commercial recession, male and female laborers are feeling the impact. If they become ill, they will inevitably be unable to afford medical treatment. Therefore, in addition to providing normal medical and pharmaceutical services at the old hospital site on Tongzhou Road, patients sent by various factories or group organizations for diagnosis and treatment are treated free of charge. If the illness is severe and hospitalization and medication are required, no fees are charged. Therefore, the number of people seeking treatment is extremely high, averaging 70-80 people per day. The new hospital behind the Tilanqiao police station also provides diagnosis and medication. Childbirth is free for poor pregnant women. If fees are charged, they are extremely economical, in order to save money and provide relief.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Liu and Yang's Marriage Gone Wrong; Groom (Whose Name Meant Monk) Missed the Wedding Date; Bride Became a Nun and Refused to Marry <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Yang Qingxiang from Tongdong works as a salesman at a flower shop in Nanshi. He has two daughters. His second daughter, Yinbao, is currently 22 years old. When she was 18, her father arranged a marriage through a matchmaker to He Shang (meaning Monk), the son of Liu Zhaokui from Chuansha, who runs a coffin shop business on Nancang Street. It was once planned to marry her off during an auspicious date in August of the 20th year of the Republic, but in the spring of that year, He Shang had a disagreement with his father and then ran away, and his whereabouts were unknown. Liu searched everywhere, but there was no news. When the scheduled wedding date arrived, Liu saw that He Shang had not returned home and immediately informed the matchmaker to notify the bride's family to postpone the wedding. When Yang found out that the wedding was a major event, that the selected auspicious day could not be changed, and that all the dowry and other preparations were already complete, he questioned Liu about the reason. Liu had no choice but to tell him that He Shang had run away and that people were being sent to look for him. They would select another auspicious date to hold the wedding after he returned home. Nearly two years have passed, and He Shang still has not returned. At the beginning of last month, He Shang suddenly returned home. Liu was overjoyed and immediately informed the bride's family, and selected New Year's Day next year as the auspicious date for the wedding. When Yang found out, he told his daughter about the wedding date. But Yinbao thought that He Shang was too absurd about the major event of marriage, and wondered how she would live if he ran away again after they were married. Therefore, she expressed her unwillingness to marry He Shang. She has now decided to become a nun in a nunnery to practice her religion. The day before yesterday, after writing a letter, she ran away. That evening, her mother did not see Yinbao return home and became very worried. Suddenly, she found the letter in a drawer and gave it to Yang to read. They were shocked and immediately sent people to search for her in the nunneries in the north and south, and also sent the girl's letter to the Liu family. When Liu saw the letter, he gave it to He Shang to read and scolded him severely. He Shang was very remorseful and did not know how to resolve the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e191">The National Goods Exhibition of the YWCA Establishes a Temporary Bazaar <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The YWCA on Yuanmingyuan Road believes that in order to promote domestic goods nationwide, it must start in Shanghai. In order to promote domestic goods in Shanghai, it must start in the family. In order to promote domestic goods in the family, it must start with women. Therefore, it is specially working with the Shanghai women's community to hold the first domestic goods campaign, scheduled to hold a domestic goods exhibition at the YWCA on December 14, 15, and 16. News of the preparations for the exhibition has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper.

<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Ministry of Finance plans to increase the unified tax on matches, cigarettes, and cement. The match and cement industries are submitting documents requesting exemption from the increased tax, which has not yet been decided. As for cigarettes, the Ministry of Finance has already ordered the cigarette factory association to instruct the cigarette factories to increase the tax on first-class cigarettes by 65 yuan per 50,000 cigarettes, and on second-class cigarettes such as Golden Mouse brand by 25 yuan per 50,000 cigarettes, starting from the 5th of this month. However, the British-American Tobacco Company has not yet made a decision due to the strike. Chinese tobacco factories will also express their sympathy. Retail cigarette merchants, due to the lack of goods on the market, have increased the price of each carton by over one jiao when purchasing from their peers. The former cigarette industry association has asked the cigarette companies to send personnel to the market. The association's Shanghai South office has dispatched Chai Yasheng, Zhang Bingyuan, Qian Wenda, Qiu Tanglin, and others to the cigarette companies to request that they sell cigarettes at the original price in order to benefit the temporary losses of the small shops. They were told that the Ministry of Finance had increased the tax and that the companies were unable to process the price increase in the air. The representatives returned empty-handed. The members have been notified to develop new methods and to add one copper coin to the previously set price list for every ten cigarettes.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Chinese Merchants' Electric Tram Company Expands Routes, Lays Double Tracks, Increases Purchase of Motor Cars and Self-Made Trailers, Totaling More Than 500,000 Yuan <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Due to the fact that the No. 4 tram line only has single tracks between Shangwen Gate and Daxing Street, the Chinese Merchants' Electric Tram Company often experiences delays. It has been decided to lay double tracks starting from the 8th, and to actively modify the tracks, purchase additional vehicles, and expand various lines. The details of each item are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e195">Purchase and Manufacture of Vehicles <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Since extending its routes this summer, the Chinese Merchants' Electric Tram Company has found that its original vehicles are insufficient for distribution. Therefore, it ordered 12 motor cars from the German Siemens Company, which have now been shipped to Shanghai. It also plans to manufacture 12 trailers. The company has already completed the drawings and submitted them to the Public Works Bureau for review. As soon as approval is granted, construction will begin, and they will be distributed for use on various lines.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Improvement of Road Tracks <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Since the company began reforming the road tracks on Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, and the Outer Ma Road, the majority of the project has been completed. The No. 4 tram line between Nanyang Bridge and Gaochang Temple, and the No. 2 tram line on the Inner and Outer Circular Roads, pass between Shangwen Gate and Daxing Street, which only has single tracks, causing the trams to wait for a long time. Therefore, the company has decided to lay double tracks starting from the 8th, which is estimated to be completed in about one month.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Costing 500,000 <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>As for the reconstruction of double tracks at Gaochang Temple, it will be carried out only after the completion of the projects on the other lines. Road construction at Lujiabang is difficult to achieve in the short term because the Public Works Bureau's road filling project has not yet been properly completed. There are rumors that the Tram Company will operate trackless trams in that area, but the company believes that the road surface is too poor for trackless trams to operate. However, it will wait for the Public Works Bureau to fill the road surface before deciding to lay tracks and open a line. The total cost of repairing and reforming various lines will reach more than 500,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The Young Women's Christian Association held its third National Congress in August this year. Many regulations were stipulated regarding the work plan for the next five years. In addition to promoting various regular works in cities and schools, it particularly focused on the development of labor and agriculture. The National Young Women's Christian Association at No. 19 Hemingyuan Road in this city, in view of the expanded scope of work and the need for many talents, believed that a large-scale recruitment and training of talents was urgently needed. After several detailed discussions by the Executive Committee, the steps and strategies for implementation have been stipulated. It has been decided to first implement recruitment in universities across the country, and then hold gatherings of female student associations from various universities to discuss the various responsibilities and contributions of the Young Women's Christian Association in building a new society, and to explore the employment choices of female university students.

<h3 id="e202">The Dispute Over the Auction of Huang Chu Jiu's Real Estate and Tongde Medical College; The Court Should Provide Fair Relief <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court auctioned Huang Chu Jiu's real estate, including the self-built buildings of Tongde Medical College, which caused objections from Tongde Medical College. However, the school is a famous academic institution and charitable organization in this city. What are the details? The society pays close attention to it. The investigation is as follows: Tongde Medical College was originally located on Maigen Road. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, when Huang Chu Jiu was the chairman of the school board, he leased his private property at No. 10441 of the British Registered Deed on Tongfu Road, along with a Western-style house on the ground, to the college. He also allowed the college to build school buildings, wards, etc. on the open space there. The college spent its own money to build two six-story buildings and seventeen bungalows. It also renovated and decorated the original Western-style house to suit the needs of the hospital and college. It also installed water and electricity projects, and spent about 57,000 yuan on repairs over the years. At that time, Huang Chu Jiu had an oral agreement to donate the base and the original Western-style house to the school, but due to debt relations, he did not hand them over in time. Unfortunately, Huang Chu Jiu died of illness two years ago. His family continued Huang's old wishes and allowed all construction, improvement, and repair costs to be repaid first in the future. Later, due to the liquidation of the Gongfa Company, the base was also part of the Gongfa Company's liquidation and was auctioned by the court. In order to protect all property rights, Tongde Medical College submitted a statement to the Second Special District Local Court, requesting that priority repayment be reserved during the auction, and was approved to record the matter in the auction announcement. However, the auction announcement did not specify it separately, so Tongde Medical College specially published a notice to solemnly clarify to avoid misunderstanding. It is found that Tongde Medical College and its affiliated hospital have been seeking expansion since Gu Yuqi became the president, adding research rooms and adding various instruments to facilitate students' practice. Therefore, the number of male and female students has increased to more than 250. Shao Lizi has also been elected as the chairman of the school board, and Chu Minyi, Sun Zhesheng, Zhu Jiahua, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Xiaolin and other gentlemen are the school board members. All school board members are leaders who are making every effort to promote new medicine and charitable undertakings. The future of the college is limitless. The court must also provide fair legal relief. It is also heard that the college, based on the relationship of lease and surface rights, has the right to use the self-built houses, water and electricity projects, etc. for at least 20 years. This legal right should not only be bound by the current lessor, but also by the purchaser of the property.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Hu Die Requests to Revoke the Trademark Contract <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Huanan Chemical Industry Company, located at No. 4 Renshou Lane, Annejin Road, French Concession, signed a contract with Ms. Hu Die, a famous movie star in Shanghai, on June 4 last year, using Hu Die's name and portrait as trademarks for five kinds of cosmetics, such as snow cream, face powder, tooth powder, toothpaste, and perfume, and submitted an application for registration to the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. When the contract was signed, the two parties agreed on the terms that 1% of the total surplus of goods sold each year would be given to Hu as remuneration, and a cash payment of 2,500 yuan would be made. It was also noted that if no products were sold on the market one year after the contract was signed, the contract should be invalidated. When the contract was signed, Huanan Company invited lawyer Zha Renwei, and Hu's side invited lawyer Feng Xizui to the scene to sign and prove it. After the contract was signed, Huanan Company produced a kind of tooth powder. On the front of the packaging bag, Hu Die's portrait was printed, and the words "Tooth Powder" were written below, but the name of the product and the trademark name were not noted. Advertisements were published in various newspapers, but it was written that Hu Die's name and portrait were used as trademarks. Later, Family Industrial Company learned that the Hu Die tooth powder produced by Huanan Company was confusing with the name of Family Industrial Company's Invincible Brand tooth powder with the butterfly as its trademark, and issued a statement in the newspaper and filed a complaint with the Trademark Bureau. The two parties were involved in litigation and opened a war of words. It was seen in various newspapers. Since then, Huanan Company has only produced tooth powder, and the remaining four kinds of goods with Hu Die as the trademark have not been released and sold on the market. Now, Hu Die's side believes that since Huanan Company has been signing the contract for more than a year, and no goods have been produced and sold, the contract should be terminated according to the agreed terms. Therefore, lawyer Feng Xizui sent a letter to Sun Zijiang, the manager of Huanan Company, requesting the revocation of the signed contract. However, Huanan Company has not made any concrete indication since receiving the letter. Hu Die had no choice but to entrust lawyer Feng to file a complaint with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Local Court to request the revocation of the contract with Huanan Company. After the court sent the summons according to the complaint, the defendant also invited lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Peng Yuanxun to file a defense. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiaoke summoned both parties to the Civil Court No. 7 of the Second Special District Court. The lawyers representing both parties appeared in court. After the court briefly questioned the agents of both parties, it was announced that evidence still needed to be investigated, and the officer ordered to wait for a scheduled summons for further interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Morphine Hidden in the Soles of Shoes; Cracked at the South Railway Station <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>At the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway South Railway Station, passengers were found carrying morphine and red pill drugs one after another in previous days, intending to transport them to other places for sale. All of them were cracked by the supervisors and police officers of the First District stationed at the South Railway Station by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Two cases of criminals were cracked and morphine and red pills were seized. It is known that at 8:30 a.m. yesterday, Wang Yitai, a 61-year-old man from Hangzhou, was carrying a blue-striped white cloth parcel with a pair of white cloth yellow-soled shoes inside. The soles of the two shoes contained one tael, six mace, and five fen of morphine. He went to the South Railway Station to take the Shanghai-Hangzhou train and was wandering outside the platform, looking panicked. Chen Chaozhen, the station supervisor of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Hu Yiqian, the investigator, found out and immediately stopped him with Yang Guiqing, a police officer of the Second District, and conducted an inspection. The morphine was seized on the spot in the shoes, and the witness was taken to the district together. The district chief, Police Officer Li, confirmed the confession after questioning. In the afternoon, he ordered to prepare a document and escort the criminal Wang and the morphine to the general bureau for handling.</p>

<p>No. 17 Dongxin Lane, the intersection of Avenue Road and Maidiyuan Road, French Concession, is a brothel opened by Xu Jikui from Yangzhou. At 0:28 p.m. yesterday, the electric wire suddenly experienced a power surge, and suddenly smoke filled the air and the fire was out of control. One house was burned down and the flooring of a brothel at No. 16 was also affected. Later, the Dada Zimin Zhong Fire Brigade rushed to the scene to put out the fire, and it was not extinguished until 1:30 p.m. The fire chief was detained by the patrol and asked about the details of the power surge.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Old Man and Young Wife's Nine-Day Marriage; Xu Jinfu Unwilling to Lose His Concubine; Lawsuit Involves Many People <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>No. 61 Yongxing Lane, Gonghexin Road, Zhabei, Xu Jinfu from Yangzhou, over 40 years old, is still childless. Because of his worries about dying without an heir, he asked Wang Cunzhi as a matchmaker to marry Dai Huainv, the 19-year-old daughter of Dai Tian from Qinzhou, Jiangbei, as his concubine for 200 yuan, hoping to have children. Unexpectedly, she moved in and lived with him on September 20, but ran away without a trace after nine days. Xu Xianxun suspected that she was releasing a white dove, so he negotiated with Wang Daqi and then entrusted Jiang Wenyi to find Dai Tian in Jiangbei. The woman lived in Yujia Temple, Yangjiadu, Pudong, at the home of her sister Dai Li. Talking about her daughter, it was learned that her daughter ran away because she did not want to marry this old man, and Dai Yangxiao, the husband of Dai Li, sent her to Jiangbei. As a result, Dai Tian was unable to hand over the person. Xu Jinfu went to the No. 1 Office of the Third District of Pudong to file a complaint. Wang Cunzhi, Dai Tian, and others were arrested. The woman confessed to the previous situation after interrogation, so Dai Li and Jiang Wenyi were also summoned to the office and sent to the Public Security Bureau, and were sent to the local court yesterday for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Forging Signatures to Buy Sand Field Case; Ling Yunsu Denies Collusion; Court Orders the Plaintiff to Appear in Person <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Ling Yunzhai, an elderly man over seventy years old, is from Gaoqiao, Pudong. He recently hired lawyers Yin Shijie and Wang Weizhen to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Local Court against Kuang Zhongmou and Lu Yangchun, the owners of the Lai Market, for forging signatures, requesting legal action, and filing a collateral civil lawsuit. The statement briefly stated that the plaintiff purchased 26 mu, 3 fen, 6 li, and 5 hao of tidal land in Chunyi Gaoqiao Township from the Sand Field Bureau of the Ministry of Finance on August 17 of the 11th year of the Republic of China, and obtained the No. 9969 Su Sha Ling Ji Hu Cai Bureau license of the Ministry of Finance, and had legally paid grain and managed the property. Later, due to business, the document was mortgaged to the second defendant for several years. Repeatedly asked the agent to redeem it, but they all kept delaying. Unexpectedly, the Land Bureau recently cleared up the old case of rat sand (i.e., Gaoqiao sand). The first defendant actually erected stone boundaries on the land in the name of Yongning Company, claiming that it belonged to him. The plaintiff negotiated with the first defendant, who claimed that he had purchased it from the plaintiff and submitted a book printed by him (the property evidence submitted by Yongning Company), which actually contained a photo of the document and a photo of the official sale contract, each on one page. Looking closely at the sale contract (the date of the sale contract was April of the 13th year), under the name of Ling Runji, there was an unrecognizable flourish, with the small characters "Dai Ya" (代押) below. It was extremely shocking. The plaintiff had never issued this document, and he always used the seal with the two characters "Yunzhai" (雲齋) in seal script to show good faith. This signature was forged. It was obvious that the first and second defendants colluded to forge the signature, harming the plaintiff. If legal action is not taken, how can evil be deterred and property rights protected? Their actions constitute a crime under Article 234, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and a collateral civil lawsuit to confirm that the purchase is invalid. The court had previously held a hearing that was not concluded. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Sun Jikang continued the trial. The plaintiff did not appear, and lawyer Yin Shijie appeared on his behalf. The defendant Kuang Zhongmou and his lawyer also appeared in court at the same time. The judge briefly questioned the lawyers of both parties and then announced: "Today, the plaintiff did not appear. Wait for a rescheduled date. The plaintiff must appear in person to facilitate interrogation and verification."</p>

<p>Xu Zhaoquan, a 35-year-old man from Wuxi, was a waiter at the Hongyun Restaurant opened by Qian Zhengfu at No. 1103 Hanbil Road. At around 9:00 p.m. the night before, his colleague Miao Fuquan was cooking vegetables, and Xu嫌其手脚迟缓责, slightly rebuked him for being slow. Miao also refused to accept, so the two quarreled with each other. At that time, the owner of the restaurant returned from outside and learned the details of the dispute. He concluded that Miao was wrong, slapped him on the forehead, and ordered him to leave the restaurant immediately. Miao felt even more resentful after listening to the words, and went forward to argue with Xu. Suddenly, the two began to wrestle with each other. However, at that time, Xu was standing on a step ladder. For some reason, he could not stand firm and fell to the ground. Unexpectedly, after falling to the ground, he lost consciousness. Later, the owner of the restaurant sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died soon after. The hospital reported to the Hongkou Patrol Station, which ordered Detective Zhang Shoushan to investigate. Miao was arrested and detained at the patrol station. Xu's body was taken to the Ferrer Body Inspection Office. Yesterday morning, the report was sent to the First Special District Local Court. Prosecutor Guo Wei went to the office to examine the body and questioned the witnesses Wan Arong and Zhao Agou, who claimed that they saw the two arguing and wrestling with each other at that time. Xu suddenly fell to the ground from a step ladder and lost consciousness. Miao Fuquan, 21 years old, also claimed that there was an argument at that time, but he did not wrestle with him, and claimed that he did not know how he fell. The rest of the confessions were vague. Mr. Guo obtained the confession and then announced that the deceased Xu Zhaoquan was a male and died from a head injury sustained before his death. Miao Fuquan was suspected of committing a crime and should be prosecuted by the patrol station and sent to the court for review. The body was handed over to his wife, Xu Ma, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial.</p>

<p>Ni Haisheng, a farmer from Haimen, who lived at No. 653 Fahua Township, Jing'an Temple Road, and his eldest son Qingfu, and second son Jifu also followed their father in farming for a living, and their family was extremely impoverished. In the 10th year of the Republic of China, Jifu and Yang Wang's daughter Cuidi, who is now 22 years old, were engaged. Later, due to poverty, disputes arose, and they could not get married. The Yang woman and her daughter came to Shanghai and recently lived in a workshop in the Yufeng Yarn Factory on Dinghai Road. Cuidi worked in the factory and earned money to support herself, unwilling to be Ni's wife. At around 6:00 a.m. on the 28th of last month, Ni Haisheng and his three sons hired a car from the Xiangxing Company on Yuwei Road and parked it near the factory, in accordance with the rural custom of snatching the bride. When Ms. Yang finished her night shift and went out, she was dragged into the car by the Ni family, intending to drive her home to get married. The woman cried out for help. The driver, Huang Ayuan, saw that the situation was not good and drove the car to the General Patrol Station on Fuzhou Road. After questioning, he learned that it was a marital dispute. Due to the location of the incident, he ordered the thousand people to be transferred to the Yangshupu Patrol Station. Ni Haisheng and his sons, seeing that the matter had become stiff, lied that Ms. Yang was Jifu's wife, whom they had married on the 12th day of the first month of this year. After living together for about three months, the woman secretly fled to Shanghai. They asked her to go home, but Ms. Yang denied that she was married to Jifu and that there was no engagement or marriage. If they did not believe it, she was still a virgin. The patrol head, seeing that the circumstances were bizarre, sent the woman to the Sacred Heart Hospital. After the doctor's examination, it was confirmed that she was indeed a virgin. The Ni family was detained. Later, wedding red posts and letters were found at the Ni family's home, so they were sent to the First Special District Court. Under questioning, both parties insisted on their own versions. The defendant insisted that Jifu and Ms. Yang were actually married on the 12th day of the first month. The case was peculiar, and the court ordered it to be reviewed again at a later date. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan came to the Criminal Court No. 3 to continue the trial. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the patrol station, stated that the red post for the engagement between Ms. Yang and Ni Jifu in this case was not forged. Perhaps the woman's mother regretted the engagement because she disliked the Ni family's poverty. The defendant's snatching of the bride was a common occurrence in rural customs, and they did not know that they had violated the criminal law. There was actually no marriage. The defendant insisted that Ms. Yang and Jifu were actually married on the 12th day of the first month, while Yang Wang and her daughter Cuidi completely denied it. For the sake of caution, the court ordered the woman to be re-examined by a medical doctor. The result was still that she was a virgin. Cuidi requested that the defendants be punished. Judge Wu then sentenced the three defendants, Ni Haisheng, etc., to three months of imprisonment each. Jifu and Qingfu were given a two-year suspended sentence.</p>

Qin's left ankle bone was crushed by the rear wheel of the car. The driver was terrified and quickly carried Qin into the car and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital then reported to the Laozha Patrol Station, and the patrol head immediately sent a detective to the hospital to inquire about the matter and returned to report to the patrol head for review.</p>

The case was discovered and the detectives of the Xinzha Patrol Station arrested De Kuan and An Qing and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation.

<p>Since last month, Nine Fortune Pharmaceutical Company has been giving away commemorative coupons that can be exchanged for third-phase aviation highway construction lottery tickets with its various products as part of its tenth-anniversary celebration. This has been welcomed by all sectors, and sales have increased sharply. Except for small bottles of Bailin Ji, which come with only one coupon each, other products, such as large bottles of Bailin Ji and Nine Fortune milky white cod liver oil, each come with two commemorative coupons. Accumulating six of these coupons allows one to exchange them for one aviation lottery ticket. Therefore, those who purchase and use them come like a whirlwind and never stop coming. It is said that about seven-tenths have already been exchanged, and there are few remaining. Since the aviation lottery tickets were originally issued every three months, the exchange period for the lottery tickets was also scheduled from November 1st to January 25th of the 23rd year [of the Republic].

<p>A Glimpse of the Popularity of Embroidery Glue</p>
<p>Since the Victory brand embroidery glue was exclusively distributed by the Continental Commercial Bank, No. 617, 6th Floor, Continental Market, Nanjing Road, branch outlets have been successively established in the three major companies and the China National Products Company. Business is flourishing, and sales are increasing daily. Various art schools and education bureaus, having seen that the glue is rich in artistry and is crucial for future livelihoods, have sent personnel to the store to practice painting techniques and establish courses to teach students. In other areas, such as Xuzhou, Zhejiang, Wujin, and Jinan, contracts have been signed one after another, and distribution offices have been established. According to the embroidery industry, since the Victory brand embroidery glue was launched, its color is bright and clean, and it does not change color for a long time. Compared with general embroidery, it is not inferior at all. Its low price and time-saving nature are unmatched by embroidery. Therefore, velvet-decorated items are very popular. Currently, most of the patterns on modern women's cheongsams are painted with this glue.</p>

<p>Zhou Longbao Died from Electric Shock</p>
<p>Recently, the Hefeng Yarn Factory in Wusong Yuncao Creek was adding walls. A plasterer, Zhou Longbao, 27 years old, a local, was building the wall yesterday when a wire broke and fell. Zhou's finger touched the wire, and his body fell, killing him instantly. The Seventh District First Precinct was notified, and they instructed the local guarantor, Zhou Lansheng, to report to the local court for examination.</p>
<p>An Unmarried Couple Seeking Fun Was Lightly Punished</p>
<p>Li Juan, a 21-year-old Ningbo woman residing at No. 35 Guangqi Road in the city, is fond of fashion and loves modernity. Yesterday morning, Li was holding a young man's arm, walking together on Fuyou Road. On the way, they hugged and kissed, performing their ballroom dance. This aroused applause and cheers from a group of idlers, disturbing public order. Cao Jinbao, of the Ninth Post of the Second Precinct of the First District, saw this and, considering that they should not have such obscene behavior that hinders public morals, immediately stepped forward to stop them. Unexpectedly, the man and woman refused to stop. They were immediately taken to the precinct for questioning. After questioning by the precinct chief, the defendant confessed his name as Chuan Fengtai, a 21-year-old Ningbo native who is a tea merchant, residing at No. 2 Zhengjia Muqiao in the French Concession. Li Juan is my fiancée, and we have a very good relationship, he said. Li Juan's confession was the same. The precinct chief, considering that the man and woman were engaging in obscene behavior on the road, related to public morals, and out of consideration for their ignorance, lightly punished them and let them go.</p>
<p>Zhou Tao Stole a Leather Coat While Using the Toilet</p>
<p>Zhou Tao, 23 years old, from Pudong, a woman who secretly engages in prostitution in various amusement parks such as the Small World and Great World, went to the women's restroom in Small World at 6:00 PM the other day. She told Xu Zhang, the woman in charge of the restroom, to get some face water to wash her hands and put on makeup. There was a fashionable leather coat hanging in the restroom, which belonged to Ms. Yuan, the head of the waitresses in the World, who had left it there for safekeeping. Unexpectedly, Zhou Tao took advantage of the fact that the restroom attendant was out getting water and stole the coat, wearing it away. When Xu Zhang returned with the water, she saw that the female guest had left. She looked around the room and saw that the coat Ms. Yuan had left for safekeeping had disappeared. She realized that it had been stolen by Zhou Tao. She immediately notified Ms. Yuan and searched for it everywhere, but found no trace. Later, she found the stolen coat at a pawnshop near Nanyang Bridge, having been pawned for seven dollars. Yesterday afternoon, at about 6:00 PM, Ms. Yuan ordered Xu Zhang to continue searching everywhere and found her at the Great Thousand World. Zhou Tao admitted to stealing the coat and pawning it for seven dollars, but said that she had lost the pawn ticket. Xu Zhang took Zhou Tao to the city and turned her over to the Second Precinct of the First District for investigation. After questioning by Precinct Chief Liu, she was sentenced to be sent to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>

<h3 id="e227">"Kindness Extends to Livestock" <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>The Reuters news agency in Berlin reported on the 25th of last month: "Today, the authorities issued an order to protect mute animals, stipulating that anyone who abuses mute livestock will be sentenced to two years in prison; it is also prohibited to make them carry or transport work that is beyond their ability. At the same time, cats or foxes are not allowed to be used to train hunting dogs. As for the dissection of animals, it is in principle prohibited. However, public institutions are allowed to dissect animals to resolve doubts when exploring suspected scientific problems; however, civilians who perform dissections without a passport will be sentenced to more than six months in prison."</p>
<p>A friend of mine sighed after reading this cable: "Is it just that people in turmoil are not as good as dogs in peace? Within the same era and the same country, are people not as good as livestock?" He remembered Hitler's persecution of Jews and the suppression of dissidents. The Reuters report of Hitler's "kindness extends to livestock" was also done by Hitler. So, my friend's sigh was: "People should be reborn as livestock!"</p>
<p>But I don't think so. Because I know that it is not absolutely impossible for humans to receive equal treatment as livestock, as long as you can change your attitude as a human being, you don't necessarily have to be reborn as livestock. So, how should the attitude be changed? This can be known by looking closely at the above cable: change to "mute."</p>
<p>There is a saying in my hometown: "A mute eats Coptis chinensis, he can't tell of his suffering." It can be seen that if you are not mute, you will definitely tell of your suffering. But this is very wrong, because speaking out becomes a resistance to those who make you suffer, and this is wrong. As for livestock, they are born mute. Everyone feels very bitter when they are abused, but because they are mute, they can't speak out. Not speaking out means not saying anything, and not saying anything means they can be protected. Therefore, if you are born as a human being, you can avoid disaster if you can imitate a mute, or livestock, and be able to not speak.</p>
<p>But under Hitler's virtuous government, will Germans no longer eat beef, kill chickens and ducks, or drive dogs and horses? Not necessarily! I believe Hitler has never seen Mr. Feng Zikai's "Protecting Life Painting Collection" and been influenced by it. I believe that Germans will still eat meat, still use animal power, but the livestock will be especially fat, taste richer, and have greater strength.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Pulling and Hooking <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Huaiqiu</p>
<p>Treating "lower-class people" or "helping" to ingratiate oneself with "upper-class people" by implementing "pushing" and "kicking." This is a passive means and career, the purpose of which is simply to ingratiate oneself.</p>
<p>In order to climb into the "upper-class people's" class, to obtain the reputation of "upper-class people," and to seize the real benefits of a half-official position, it is necessary to implement the positive "pulling" and "hooking."</p>
<p>"Pushing" and "kicking" are clearing the way or being ordered to sweep; "pulling" and "hooking" are doing one's own work: standing firm step by step, climbing one step at a time.</p>
<p>"Upper-class people" will not see you, this "non-upper-class person," rising. Since you are determined to climb into that class, it is most important to watch the wind. Once the wind has been determined, you will turn the rudder with the wind, sailing with the wind. The wind, which is very spirited in front, will not turn its head to care about you, so you have to follow behind and shout: "Lord Wind, I am behind too!" At this time, you also have to "push" a few hands and "kick" a few feet to show that you are not completely incompetent. Once you happen to encounter it looking back, now is the opportunity. You have to run forward desperately, "hook" it tightly, and "pull" it tightly with both hands. If it likes to go east, you have to follow it and turn to the east; if it likes the west, you have to turn to the west... and you must always be careful: "hook" it tightly, "pull" it steadily, otherwise it will disappear in a flash, and all your efforts will be wasted. Once you have "hooked" it and "pulled" it, then slowly you also change your nature, your tail is gone, your spirit is changed, your spirit is clear and your bones are beautiful, and you also become a member of the "upper-class people."</p>
<p>In addition, there are two other kinds of "pulling" and "hooking": one is "pulling" and "hooking" a group of peers to fill my treasure seat. Once I have ascended the treasure seat, it doesn't matter if I kick them away with one foot; another is that the people on the treasure seat sometimes have to "pull" or "hook" some "lower-class people" to support the scene and join in the fun. The prosperity of Mount Tai's incense is due to this.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Stone Cart <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>The weather is severely cold, and the streets are full of desolate sights. Withered yellow leaves fall from the roadside trees, covering the ground. Occasionally, a gust of wind blows through, carrying them in a circle on the ground, making a rustling sound, and then stopping, enduring the trampling of people's feet and wheels.</p>
<p>A dilapidated cart rumbles through the street, breaking the silent air that has occupied this street for a long time. The cart is piled full of bundles of stones, ready to be transported to the construction factory to build houses for the rich.</p>
<p>There are six laborers pulling the cart. Four are pulling in front, with four tow ropes hanging from the iron ring on the roof of the cart, each person bearing at least several hundred pounds of weight on their shoulders. Two are pushing in the back, occupying one side of the cart's pole. The pole is huge, and sometimes they have to carry it on their shoulders and backs.</p>
<p>"Hang yu! Hang yu!" This natural cry comes from their mouths. They groan. The breath they exhale turns into white lines in the cold air.</p>
<p>The road has already reached its end and is about to turn. But it is still far from the destination.</p>
<p>The sky is beginning to darken, and the air is filled with white mist. But they can't see it. The heavy pressure piled on their shoulders makes it impossible for them to look up.</p>
<p>"Hey! Old Wang, put some strength into it! Turning!" said one of the people pushing the pole in the back.</p>
<p>The called Old Wang subconsciously tightened the tow rope in his hand. He is an old man without a son. His wife died early, and he only has one daughter who works in a yarn factory, earning meager wages. For the sake of life, even though he is of old age, he has to come out to pull this heavy dilapidated cart.</p>
<p>The cart rumbled as it turned a corner at this moment.</p>
<p>A gust of wind carrying sand and dust rushed towards them head-on, and they all closed their eyes for a moment. The weather is really very cold, and some people in fur coats are still shivering, but they feel hot, and their hearts are also hot.</p>
<p>"Hey! Go to the right and pull the wheels onto the tram tracks. It's much easier to pull this way." The person pushing in the back instructed again.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no need for him to instruct. Almost all the people pulling the cart have this awareness, and the wheels rolled onto the tram tracks under this awareness.</p>
<p>The weight piled on their shoulders suddenly lightened, and they couldn't help but breathe a long sigh of relief. At the same time, rough words also erupted.</p>
<p>"Ha! Gu Cailang, I heard that your wife had another miscarriage, is that right?"</p>
<p>"How could it not be? Hey! Little Lu Zi, that appearance was really miserable!" As he spoke, Yuan Cailang's nose tingled, and tears almost didn't fall. His eyes blurred. He seemed to see his wife lying in bed, with two children crying beside her. This scene smashed the middle-aged man's heart.</p>
<p>The little Lu Zi pulling the tow rope next to him didn't say anything, but he was dissatisfied with his life. He dreamed of climbing up every day, but reality never gave him satisfaction. His heart was filled with ordinary sorrow.</p>
<p>"Ah! Ah!" A tram came from behind them, which made them all panic. They quickly gathered their strength to pull the wheels off the tracks. However, it is easy to pull them on, but difficult to pull them out. Even if the people pulling bent their heads to their feet, and the people pushing pushed their whole bodies against the pole, it was all useless.</p>
<p>The people on the tram were a little impatient. From the driver to the ticket seller to the passengers, they all cursed. No one sympathized with them, but there were only scoldings.</p>
<p>It wasn't until everyone was covered in sweat that they pulled the wheels off the tracks. The tram quickly drove past them, leaving no sympathy behind.</p>
<p>Now the road in front of them is still long, but the sky has completely darkened.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Small Notes from a Guest Window <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Shu San</p>
<p>Ceng Gong's "Jian Wen Lian" records: "Li Gong of Xiya was fond of jesting. When he was in government, junior scholars came to see him. The Duke said, 'Today, gentlemen, try to compose a couplet. The first line is: "The flowers in front of the court are just beginning to bloom."' Everyone smiled at its simplicity and pondered a response. Someone said, 'Nothing is better than replying with: "Your Excellency, Mr. Li."' Everyone laughed and dispersed." Furthermore, Jin Wuxiang's "Su Xiang Sui Bi" states: Ji Xiaolan, the Grand Academician, once said that any phrase in books could be made into a couplet. A guest offered, 'Only women and petty men are difficult to deal with.' The Duke replied, 'A widow sees a widower and desires to marry him.' Both couplets are extremely humorous."</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>I acquired two editions of Li Rihua's "Wei Shui Xuan Diary." One is the complete edition published by Jiaye Hall, and the other is a selected pocket edition from the "Xiao Yuan Cong Shu." The "Jiaye Hall" edition contains a passage that reads:</p>
<p>"Twenty-sixth day (according to the calendar, it was the thirty-eighth year of the Wanli reign), cloudy. Visited Yu Bocheng's new residence. He said that Lu Wuguan's 'Record of Leaving Shu' is even more wonderful than the 'Record of Entering Shu.'"</p>
<p>That Fang Weng had a "Record of Leaving Shu" is something I only learned for the first time here. , , In the complete works of Dun Weng, there is no such text. Checking the "Research Book" and "Chronological Biography of Fang " of , it only records Fang Weng's years of leaving Shu, and does not mention this book. I think that since Fang Weng had already written "Record of Entering Shu," writing "Record of Leaving Shu" would be very difficult, and even if he did, it might not be better than the former record. What is said here is probably Yu Bocheng joking with Li Rihua, or it just refers to Fan Chengda's "Wu Chuan Lu." "Wu Chuan Lu" is "Record of Leaving Shu."</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>Li Rihua was a student of Chen Meigong. This matter is seen in Rihua's diary:</p>
<p>"Twenty-third day (according to the calendar, it was the fortieth year of the Wanli reign). Invited Tang Zigong and Zhou Jianzhi, but they didn't come. Jianzhi is an old friend from my Huating days, the grandson of Zhou Caochuang. Caochuang is now seventy and old. He used to be fond of wine, relying on his wealth to be arrogant, and enjoyed flowers, stones, and secluded amusements. I visited Song when I was young. Later, Chen Meigong immersed himself in the Book of Poetry. Caochuang was a friend of Meigong, and they were close. Now, it has been thirty-one years since then, but Caochuang's eating and drinking have not declined, which is commendable."</p>
<p>And on the twentieth day of the eleventh month of the same year, the diary also records, "Two gentlemen, Chen Meigong came, originally admired books , extremely liked Wang Shuming's 'Autumn Mountains Thatched Cottage,' believing it to be on the 'Qing Bian Tu.' Also, in the book of Jian Heng's child, he wrote, 'He seems to gain the wisdom of nature without a teacher in Jia Youxi's paintings. However, from Zi , Shuming, Lazan, and Youwen, everything is present in his brushstrokes. Learning is so profound, how could he just be a tiger child of Nangu, he should be the reappearance of the Great and Small Generals Li.'" According to this, Meigong was not only Rihua's teacher, but also had frequent interactions later.</p>

<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>So he went out.</p>
<p>It was a clear day with no wind. People in the street looked cheerful. Merchants were going about their business, office workers were going to their offices, and young girls were walking to their shops. Some were singing softly, happy because of the weather. The boat to Trouville was already full of passengers. Pierre sat on the last bench. Thinking</p>
<p>He thought L:</p>
<p>"Was she uneasy when I asked about that portrait? Or was she just surprised? Did he lose it, or did he hide it? Does she know where it is, or doesn't she? If she hid it, what was the reason?"</p>
<p>So he kept thinking, inferring from one thing to another, and reached the following conclusion:</p>
<p>That portrait, the portrait of that friend, the portrait of the lover, was kept in the living room until one day the woman first noticed that her son resembled the portrait. Undoubtedly, for a long time, she had been worried that her son would resemble the portrait; later, she indeed found that her son looked like the portrait. When she saw the appearance of this resemblance, she knew that people would eventually see it too, so one night she took away this terrible little portrait, because she did not dare to destroy it at that time, so she hid it.</p>
<p>Ben Er now clearly remembered that the small portrait had disappeared long before they left Paris. He thought the portrait disappeared when Zhe'an started to grow a beard, because his beard suddenly made him look like the golden-haired young man smiling in her frame.</p>
<p>The movement of the departing ship disturbed and distracted his thoughts! He stood up and looked at the sea.</p>
<p>After the small steamer left the embankment, it turned to the left, whistling, panting, trembling, and speeding towards the distant shore that could be seen in the morning mist. Here and there, large fishing boats with red sails could be seen motionless on the flat sea, like large reefs protruding from the sea. And the Seine River, flowing from Rouen, separated two adjacent lands like a large arm of the sea.</p>
<p>In less than an hour, he arrived at the port of Trouville, because this was the time for sea bathing. Bi Ben Er walked towards the beach. From a distance, the beach looked like a long garden full of splendid flowers. On the wide yellow dunes, from the embankment to the black rocks, umbrellas of various colors, hats of various shapes, and clothes of various differences gathered in groups in front of the dressing rooms! Standing in rows along the waves, or scattered here and there, like huge bouquets scattered on an boundless pasture. And the chaotic voices, the voices of people near and far scattered in the brisk air, greetings, shouts of children being bathed, women's laughter, etc., all formed a constant gentle clamor, mixed in the insensible breeze, and breathed in together.</p>
<p>Pierre walked among these people! The more he felt like a stranger, the more he felt separated from them, the more lonely he felt, and the more immersed he was in his painful thoughts, as if someone had thrown him from the deck of a ship into the sea a hundred miles from the difficult coast. He brushed past them, unintentionally hearing a few words; unintentionally seeing men and women talking, women smiling at men.</p>

<h3 id="e235">Overview of the Chinese College of the University of Paris (3) <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>(5) Funding When the Chinese College was founded, the Chinese government promised to subsidize 100,000 francs per year, and the French government subsidized 20,000 francs. However, after it was opened, the Chinese government did not pay a single penny. The college was able to survive for seven or eight years only by relying on the French government's donation. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the Boxer Indemnity issue was resolved, and various Chinese and French cultural institutions were able to share in the profits. The Chinese-French College also received 10,000 US dollars per year. Therefore, the college's budget was established. This year's accounts have not yet been settled. The following is a list of last year's income and expenditure to give a general overview.</p>
<p>(1) Income: 253,725.00 francs remaining from the Boxer Indemnity allocated by the French government, equivalent to 10,000 US dollars, 20,000.00 francs subsidized by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 138,210.90 francs from last year's surplus, totaling 411,608.05 francs.</p>
<p>(2) Expenditure: 175,400.00 francs for salaries, 29,306.25 francs for office expenses, 47,824.10 francs for books, 50,318.00 francs for publication fees and inspection fees, totaling 302,848.35 francs, and 108,759.70 francs in storage.</p>
<p>In addition to the formal income listed above, in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially allocated 346,500 francs from the unspent Boxer Indemnity. The college used 200,000 of this money to purchase Mr. Bo Xihuo's books, and 146,500 to purchase Chinese books. In addition, the college also provides appropriate subsidies to poor students who are interested in learning, or helps with the printing fees of dissertations, etc. The amount ranges from 1,000 to 6,000 francs. Last year, nine people received this subsidy.</p>
<p>(6) Library In the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Chinese College obtained a fixed building within the University of Paris, with a lecture hall that can accommodate 100 people, a small classroom, a self-study room, and offices for the secretary and librarian. The books are displayed on the walls of the four corridors and various rooms.</p>
<p>Although the college's library was established not long ago, it has allocated 50,000 to 60,000 francs as regular expenses in the budget every year. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, it also received a large amount of special funds. Therefore, the collection of books is particularly rapid and rich. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, it already had 25,000 volumes. When the former representative Gao Shuyu, the minister to France, arrived in France, he also donated 4,000 volumes in the name of Chinese people. Mr. Bo Xihuo sold about 10,000 volumes. Last year, when Mr. Bo went to China, he purchased 20,000 tons of books for the college. The collection contains many treasures, such as the works of Chavanne, Legge, and Couvreur. The types of books are mostly literature, philosophy, history, and art. There are also many records of geography, customs, and ethnic groups in various provinces, counties, and foreign territories of our country, many of which are out of print. There is currently no one who has been properly organized. The director of the museum, Di Babiyuo, has limited knowledge of China and is unable to do the job. It is planned to ask Mr. Wu Kang to take charge of the museum's affairs in addition to teaching from next year. Mr. Wu's knowledge of Chinese and French is very profound and can be said to be a celebration of getting the right person. The museum is currently only open one day a week, which is quite a burden for general students. After being organized, it is expected that it will be more convenient for readers.</p>
<p>(7) Publications There are currently two types of publications from the Chinese College. One is the fourth volume of the "Selected Translations of the Great Tibetan Sutra," the posthumous work of Shawan, which will be printed soon. The other is the Tang Dynasty History translated by De Luoduo, which has now been published. It has now been decided to print two copies of the original manuscript of the "Secret History of Mongolia" in Leningrad using photographic methods, one copy to be stored in the college and one copy to be exchanged for books with China. This is a mutually beneficial method.</p>
<p>The overview of the Chinese College is roughly as described above. According to the college, although it has been established for 13 years, it did not have a fixed budget and complete its organization until after the 15th year of the Republic of China. Since then, it has gradually developed, the number of students has increased year by year, and publications have been gradually issued, showing a trend of increasing prosperity. This is due to the enthusiastic management of Mr. Ge Lanyan. In addition, Mr. Bo Xihuo is a major pillar of the college, and he has received a lot of spiritual help. He inherited the mantle of Shawan Gedi and became the leading figure in French sinology. Now that he is teaching there, it has greatly increased the college's honor and prestige. This is why the Chinese College of the University of Paris is highly regarded by sinologists in Europe and the United States. In the past 30 years, more and more Europeans have been studying our country's culture, but there are not many such large-scale research and transmission institutions. Our country urgently needs to give it practical help and guidance, so that the college can continue to develop, complete the mission of Sino-French cultural cooperation, and promote the development of Chinese civilization, which is also the blessing of our country.

<p>Yesterday (the 2nd), the Patriotic Girls' School on Jiangwan Road in this city celebrated its 32nd anniversary of establishment. It was also the initial completion of the restoration plan. Therefore, a commemorative meeting was held at 9 am that day. The grand occasion is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Commemorative Ceremony When the bell rang ten times, the school flag was raised high, and the heavy door was opened. The Boy Scouts were energetic and distributed to their posts. The Public Security Bureau was also notified to send police to the scene to maintain order together. Teachers, students, and guests were seated. At 10 o'clock, the meeting was reported to be opened. Principal Sun, the chairman, reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying that the school has a glorious history, and many graduates serve in the society. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by the January 28th Incident and suffered a major blow. In the past year, he has tried his best to restore it, and today's achievements are all due to the confidence when he moved back. What is the confidence? The Chinese nation will never perish. Then, Jiang Jianbai, the representative of the Education Bureau, gave a training speech, and then Cai Yuanpei, the director of the school, gave a speech, the general idea being that food, clothing, housing, and transportation are necessary for life, and so is school. Then, Chu Minyi, the director of the school, gave a speech, briefly saying that the evolution of the world is entirely based on the brain. People in our country have always divided mental and physical work into two things. In fact, physical workers must also use their brains. Therefore, practical mental work can encompass physical work. The value generated by mental work is unlimited. At present, women must diligently seek knowledge. In the future, if they promote education or raise children at home, the Chinese people's wisdom will be fully developed, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrine of saving the country can be achieved. Next, Jiang Zhuzhuang, the director of the school, gave a detailed account of the history of the founding of the Patriotic Girls' School. Then, Zhao Zhengping, the former president of the school, gave a speech, the general idea being that young people must love their alma mater so that it can move towards development.

The exhibits were dazzling, and the layout of each classroom was ingenious, forming a rhythm with each other, and there was a lot of static beauty.</p>
<p>(3) Sports Performance Starting at 2:30 pm, the school's sports department performed sports in the gym. Li Jiyuan was the chairman and Chen Fen was the leader. The programs performed were: 1) Walking, 2) Black Team Exercises, 3) Baton Exercises, 4) Chorus, 5) Yanqing Boxing, 6) Correction Exercises, 7) Jumping Box, 8) Bilking Dance, 9) Ribbing Exercises, 10) Piano Solo, 11) Erlang Boxing, 12) Towel Exercises, 13) Double Lifting, 14) Raf Tufta Taft Dance, 15) Hanging Exercises, 16) Tai Chi Boxing, 19) Pyramid, 18) Bamboo Standing Competition, the skills were extremely pure.

On the day of the school anniversary, the sounds of permission were endless. The students were grateful for the efforts of the workers, so they automatically launched a consolation campaign, collecting money to buy towels, food and other items, and sending representatives to the construction site to distribute them to the workers to show their condolences.</p>
<p>(5) Alumni Association Meeting The school originally had an organization of the Alumni Association, but because most of the alumni over the years were scattered in various ports, the address book was lost after the war, and communication was difficult, so the progress was slow. Yesterday, taking advantage of the commemorative meeting, the alumni in this city gathered to discuss and decided to start with the investigation and then restore the organization.</p>
<p>(6) Dinner and Entertainment In the evening, all the teachers and students of the school had dinner together, and educational films were shown for entertainment.</p>

<p>Yesterday, due to Daxia University's forfeit, only the Jinan University vs. Guanghua University match remained in the Jiangnan University Sports Association football tournament. The match was held at Guanghua University at 2:30 pm. Jinan University has been the champion for many years, with talented players emerging continuously and strong combat power. Guanghua University, after its decline, has very few new talented players and is far from Jinan University's opponent. As a result, Jinan University won 5-1.</p>

<h3 id="e246">Huasai's Irresistible Force Causes Unprecedented Crushing Defeat to Youyou: Group A Match 丨13-2丨 Chen Rong is Disorganized, Defenders Injured <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Huasai's victory over Youyou was originally a possible event, but Youyou's loss of 2-13 was indeed unexpected. Huasai's lineup is getting stronger day by day. The close connection, the average talent, and the outstanding artistic skills of each player have not been seen in Shanghai's football scene for many years. Even Agal, who caused a stir last year, pales in comparison. Initially, Donghua's victory of 2-1 was due to the fact that, in terms of true football skills, Donghua was not as good. Moreover, at that time, Huasai had just arrived in Shanghai and had just unloaded its luggage. The current situation is even more different than before. However, Youyou's talent is also among the best in Shanghai's Chinese players. The reason for the defeat lies in the disorganization of the lineup. The whole team is for themselves and cannot connect, which is also a strange thing. Yesterday, the three or four thousand spectators in Yiyuan, in addition to disappointment, were all surprised.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Eventful First Half <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>After the start of the match, Huasai immediately launched a full-scale attack. Within five minutes, Jones scored a goal. Wang Shusen's obstruction was ineffective, and goalkeeper Tang Yongchun failed to catch the ball and slipped into the goal. After the center kick-off, Aqiao scored another goal without much back and forth. Youyou inevitably lost morale after conceding two goals in the shortest time. However, they tried their best to cheer up and did not slack off. Unfortunately, Wang Shusen suddenly reported a foot injury and had to leave the field, fighting with only ten players. As a result, the storm became more and more intense, becoming an eventful time. Huasai took advantage of the situation and plundered, as if entering an uninhabited area,浩浩荡荡，不可一世. After the center forward scored the third goal, Xi Qiaosheng committed a foul and was penalized with a twelve-yard penalty, which was missed. The ball bounced back from the goalpost. Afterwards, a free kick was awarded, and right inside forward Jones headed it in, making it 4-0. Seeing that the situation was not good, Youyou replaced Wang Shusen with Zhuang Shihong, and Chen Jiaqiu took over as a midfielder, stubbornly resisting and boosting morale, striving for a counterattack. Sun Jinshun received support from Jiaqiu and scored a goal. After that, Zhuang Shihong was penalized with another twelve-yard penalty, and Tang Yongchun successfully saved the day, turning danger into safety. In the first half, Huasai won 4-1.</p>
<h3 id="e248">The Situation is Even Worse in the Second Half <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, Youyou became even more disorganized. Huasai's fierce general Maolin was transferred from the right wing to his original center forward position, and his momentum was particularly fierce. In addition, Youyou's midfielder was the biggest loophole, allowing the enemy to drive straight in and run rampant. Therefore, the front of the goal was densely populated with enemy traces, surrounded on all sides, truly a "stormy city, every bush and tree an enemy soldier." Within seven or eight minutes, Jones scored a goal. In desperation, Youyou Zhong Yongshen received the ball from Sun Jinshun and broke in single-handedly, scoring a goal. From then on, although Youyou launched several attacks, the enemy's defenses were deep and impenetrable. Huasai's momentum was still unabated, and the situation became one-sided, with eight more goals being scored in succession, resulting in a score of 13-2.</p>

<p>The Western League Football Association, Group A, today's match between Donghua and French Commerce at 3 pm, is the most important match since the start of this season's football season. French Commerce has four wins in four games, while Donghua has three games, one win, one draw, and one loss. The situation is certainly not comparable, but Donghua is known for its solid defense and close connection. There will be a thrilling battle at that time, and it is difficult to predict the outcome. However, Parke, the fierce general of French Commerce, has been penalized with a two-week suspension and will not be able to play today, giving Donghua a good opportunity. The match venue is in Yiyuan. In addition, Jinan will face Western Commerce on the baseball field at 3 pm today. Western Commerce is a mediocre team, and Jinan should be able to secure victory.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were three Group A football matches. Youyou's lineup was disorganized, and Wang Shusen's foot injury forced him to leave the field, fighting with only ten players, greatly reducing its strength. In addition, Huasai was unstoppable and its momentum was blazing, resulting in a large score of 13-2. Youyou suffered a crushing defeat. In the other Group C matches, Western Police beat British Navy 3-2, and Lax beat Shager 5-0.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were eight major and minor battles in the Xiqing Basketball Tournament, starting from 2 pm until after 10 pm. There were three Group B games and five Group A games. The two most exciting games were Pirates vs. Nanxing and Hujiang vs. Qingguang. The results of each game are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Mingqiang Wins Meigong (B3) 53-22</p>
<p>(2) Mailing Wins Fei Team (B3) 36-16</p>
<p>(3) Wing Team Wins Huzhong (B3) 29-26</p>

<h3 id="e257">Jiangwan Wins Chizhi <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>After the initial contact, a stalemate formed. After one minute of competition, Fudan took the lead with a well-coordinated play, and Ma Kaihua scored a long-range shot. After the record was opened, Zhao Butian and Zhou Dayun scored in succession. When Jiangwan scored twelve points, Chizhi had not scored. Yu Junchi and Qian Dingshen struggled several times and did not disgrace their mission, adding six points. After that, although Chizhi repeatedly changed reinforcements, it was ultimately ineffective due to its weaker strength. Jiangwan's scoring was like a torrent of the Yellow River, pouring down. The result of the first half was 31-8, Jiangwan winning. In the second half, Fudan Zhou and Zhang temporarily left the field, but their prestige remained strong. Chizhi's attack gradually developed, and the battle became more intense. Fudan forward Fu Xiangrui repeatedly scored shots, and the score increased again. Afterwards, Fudan lost another player, and from then on, its momentum declined. As a result, Jiangwan won 60-26.</p>

<p>Under the engagement of both sides, the strengths were evenly matched, and there was back and forth for about two minutes, with no achievements. Then, due to Liu Jingfeng's intrusion and foul, Carson scored two points from the penalty. Then, Shi Guiya and Schmidt scored successively. Nanxing Zhou Han'an snatched back a goal in the midst of difficulties. However, due to the ferocity of the Pirates, the entire army was busy defending their homes and had no chance to attack. However, Nanxing's stubborn resistance was enough to prevent the Pirates from doing whatever they wanted. As such, after competing for a long time, although the Pirates gained something, Nanxing also made reciprocal gestures from time to time, once approaching the score. Afterwards, the Pirates intensified their efforts, relying on the speed of the entire team's cooperation, and were scored on again. The first half was 21-10. In the sound of battle, the situation became more tense. Close combat and hand-to-hand fighting did not result in much development. The forwards and defenders on both sides were able to perform their duties well and performed extremely well. Nanxing's biggest shortcoming was that its shooting was not as good as the Pirates, so it often missed good opportunities, and the score thus regressed rather than advanced. By the time the time was about to end, the general trend had passed. The overall result was 42-23, and Nanxing was defeated.</p>

<p>The initial battle was extremely fierce. Jinan's forward talent was better than the opponent's. Huang Zhaolin personally took charge, and the connection was even more exquisite. The Daredevils team's manpower was not complete this year, and there were many unknown soldiers, who were brave but lacked strategy, all Meng Huo-like figures. Under these circumstances, Jinan's entering the battle was naturally as desired. Therefore, in an instant, it was already far ahead, with a difference of more than ten points. However, afterwards, the Daredevils desperately resisted, and it became more difficult to advance, and a stalemate formed. After a long time of fighting, Jinan became active again, and Han Zhenyuan broke through the enemy's basket twice, boosting morale. At the end of the first half, Jinan was 31 and the Daredevils were 11. In the second half, Jinan completely changed the team, replacing it with five fresh troops. Although they were not as compact as the previous players, they were more than enough to deal with the Daredevils. The battle was extremely well-matched. After such contact, after a quarter of an hour, Wang Nanzhen, Han Zhenyuan, and Yin Guiren were reinstated and rebuilt their hegemony. Sure enough, the connection was particularly good, and the numbers increased again. The overall result was that Jinan won 56-28.</p>

<p>Hujiang's Sun Baoqing and Lu Zhonghui took too much leave from school due to the National Games, and the school did not approve it and did not allow them to play. In addition, Wu Guolin went to Hankou, and the strength was greatly affected. The entire team relied on Feng Nianhua and Qian Jingyong to preside, and the newcomers Sun Huiming, Liu Jiayu, and Chen Weimin were used. Although their ball skills were not weak, they were not as good as before. Qingguang gathered its old troops and revitalized itself, and its combat power was still very strong. Under the engagement of the two teams, it was quite fierce, and they monitored each other extremely closely. Hujiang took the lead from time to time, and Qingguang followed closely behind, not letting go. However, after 9-9, Hujiang's Chen Weimin repeatedly made great contributions, and the score led by a lot. Then Feng Nianhua and Qian Jingyong cooperated greatly and performed wonderfully, scoring continuously and taking the lead with 23-11. Unexpectedly, the recorder made a mistake, and Liu Jiayu committed three fouls and was wrongly called out after four fouls. Then Qingguang's Chen Baoqiu was also called out after four fouls. Shao Peida and Dahua launched an offensive, and Qu Xianzhu made meritorious contributions. The first half ended 24-18, Hujiang taking the lead. As the battle started again, Hujiang made the first move. Feng Nianhua pounced like a tiger, scoring three times in a row. Chen and Qian also scored in tandem, scoring eleven points in a row. Qingguang tried to advance, and the situation really changed. Dong Shaopei aimed his eyes, and Tan Dahua provided support. The score rose sharply, changing to 41-39. Hujiang took the lead by only two points, and the competition became even more intense. Hujiang was not flustered and changed its strategy. Feng and Qian scored three balls in a row, and the situation became stable again, and continued to work hard, and the momentum was strong.</p>

<p>The last game was Allied Nations vs. Xiaguang. Allied Nations was organized by a group of veterans and was indeed a strong team, but it lacked connection. After Xiaguang's Ren Jiexing was injured and Chen Baolin surrendered to Qingguang, its strength was greatly reduced. After the start of the game, Allied Nations had a clear advantage and scored many points in a row. However, the situation was quite chaotic, because both sides lacked connection. Xiaguang tried its best to catch up and made many achievements, once tying the score at 15-15. However, Xiaguang failed to surpass the leader. After that, the score was extremely close. The first half was 27-23, Allied Nations winning. As the battle started again, the situation did not improve. Allied Nations had more shooting opportunities and took the lead. Xiaguang was forced to monitor and had difficulty developing opportunities. In the long run, the result was 46-32, Allied Nations winning. Chen Xianglong's performance was the best, and Xia Zeren and Lin Zequn's defense was also quite good.</p>

<p>The Pegasus Cross-Country Team and the Huaguang Track and Field Team have jointly launched the "Fei Hua Cup" Open Cross-Country Race, earnestly inviting various teams to participate, fostering camaraderie, engaging in mutual learning, improving the performance of Chinese athletes, preparing for international competitions in the coming spring, avenging past defeats, and striving for national glory. It is now scheduled to take place at 3 PM this afternoon at Jiangwan Fudan University, departing from Xiangyin Road outside the university's main gate, passing through East Sports Association Road and West Sports Association Road, and returning. The total distance is about four miles, or approximately seven thousand meters, along a wide and smooth route, making it extremely convenient.</p>
<p>| Strength of Each Team |</p>
<p>A total of fourteen teams have registered to join this time, gathering the elite of Shanghai, with over one hundred team members in total. This is truly an unprecedented grand event in Shanghai. The vast and bustling Xiangyin Road will be transformed into a battleground for heroes. In terms of team strength, the Jiangnan Team is considered the most promising, with members such as Jin Zhongkang, Dong Shuzhao, Zhou Guangwu, Liu Yibi, Li Yanxiang, and Zhen Xingpei, some of whom are national champions or experts in their respective fields. Their formidable strength is highly noteworthy. The renowned Baihong Track and Field Team of Shanghai also boasts generals such as Dong Jiaxie, Xu Yanbo, Zhou Ruquan, Chen Zhiyuan, and Zhou Songzan. Although they may not overwhelm Jiangnan, the intensity of the competition is expected, preventing the Jiangnan Team from resting easy. The Puguang Team has a group of young athletes relying on the momentum of their middle school championship from last year, and they may also deliver a surprising performance. The Huaguang Track and Field Team, with Wang Zhenglin as its mainstay, supplemented by new heroes, can form a tripartite force with Jiangnan and Baihong. Although the Pegasus Cross-Country Team has a large number of members, the hopes for generals like Jin Zhongkang and Li Yagu may be difficult to fulfill, but several individuals like Yang Qingxie and Lan Shijie have relatively balanced strength and may achieve respectable results, following behind the Jiangnan teams. In terms of individuals, Jin Zhongkang and Wang Zhenglin are a pair of "comrades," each displaying ambition and possessing strength, making it difficult to determine the champion before the competition. Furthermore, Dong Shuzhao, Zhou Guangwu, Yang Qingxie, Zhen Xingpei, Li Yanxiang, and Lan Shijie are all renowned generals who cannot be ignored. The top few places in the future will likely be among these individuals. In addition to the large silver cup jointly donated by Pegasus and Huaguang as a prize for the team champion, the Jiangnan Sports Normal School is also offering a silver shield for the individual first place. It remains to be seen whose trophy it will become.</p>

<h3 id="e264">Desire and Madness <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Tun</p>
<p>"It is difficult to fill the pit of desire," is a common saying based on human experience. From a pessimistic viewpoint, "rampant human desire" has led to the decline of social morals. From an optimistic viewpoint, it is precisely because of the relentless expansion of human desires that the bizarre and dazzling modern civilization, both materially and spiritually, has been created.</p>
<p>The expansion of appetite has led to the amassing of delicacies from land and sea; the unrestrainedness of carnal desire has propelled the palace of art; the expansion of the desire for power and leadership has shaped the unpredictable political landscape; the accumulation of the desire for wealth has led to the extreme form of capitalism; and the stimulation of the desire for knowledge and the fascination with fame have expanded the authority of science and the opening up of new realms and the invention of new things. ... Thus, the desires within humanity have become the engine of creation, and all human affairs have become its wheels and gears, leading to mass production.</p>
<p>To expand desire to the point of madness is seen as a very dangerous thing by those who hold a philosophy of self-preservation and prudence. However, the enactment of modern civilization seems to depend on the unrestrained expression of these madmen and their madness; examples are too numerous to count.</p>
<p>Consider Franklin, who explored the Arctic twice to prove his belief in the Northwest Passage. As a result, his body was forever buried in the snowy Arctic ice. However, his first map of the Arctic sea route became the blueprint for later explorers. Cook, in order to find the future continent behind the Pacific Ocean, braved the winds and waves in a small boat and discovered the east coast of Australia, illuminating Australian geography to the world. The elderly Professor Piccard ascended into the stratosphere several times, setting a record-breaking feat. In the past decade, British archaeologist Antero ignored his wife's divorce lawsuit after sixteen years of marriage in order to investigate the historical sites of the Mongolian desert. ... Are these examples not due to the stimulation of the desire for knowledge, manifesting as a crazed dedication?</p>
<p>If humanity simply followed the beaten path, perhaps we would still be living as cave dwellers. It is precisely because there are those intelligent and courageous pioneers who venture into the wilderness, towards the rivers, towards the oceans, towards the skies, that they become the pioneers of civilization, providing a path for the masses to seek their own interests. Without these crazy pioneers, the masses would have no benefits to gain." These words of Francis Younghusband, the president of the Royal Geographical Society of England, are worth emulating.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Anecdotes of Revolution in the Eastern Paradise <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Xinpei</p>
<p>Penang Island in the South Seas, with its bright mountains, clear waters, beautiful scenery, and extraordinary products, has been under British rule for over a century. Through the efforts of excavating mountains, opening roads, and constructing, its beauty has been further enhanced. Therefore, Westerners have praised it as the "Eastern Paradise." When Sun Yat-sen was traveling for the revolution, he visited the island several times. Tanjong Beach and the Xin Guang Garden were important secret locations for planning the revolution, just like the Wan Qing Yuan in Singapore and the Jue Xing Garden in Perak. With heroic sentiments and remarkable events, there are many anecdotes. Here is one of them.</p>
<p>Two years before the founding of the Republic of China, the Qing government was in disarray and deteriorating. Uprisings were repeatedly thwarted, morale was low, and the people were depressed. The pro-Qing party in the South Seas, led by Tu Yongyi, used every opportunity to ridicule our party. Therefore, Wang Jingwei, Huang Fusheng, Chen Bijun, and Yu Peilun planned to take advantage of an opportunity to strike at the Regent Zai Feng in the depths of the Forbidden City, emulating the assassination attempt at Bolangsha, hoping to inspire the nation's spirit through their actions. However, they lacked the necessary funds and were unable to proceed. Chen Bijun discussed the matter with her mother, Madam Wei, who had long been a member of the Tongmenghui and a staunch believer in the Three Principles of the People. Madam Wei readily agreed and provided the necessary funds. Chen Bijun then secretly went to Beijing and established the Shouzhen Photo Studio as a base for transporting ammunition and manufacturing medicine. Unfortunately, their plan was exposed, and Wang Jingwei and Huang Fusheng were arrested, while Chen Bijun and Yu Peilun narrowly escaped. After getting out of danger, Chen Bijun returned to Penang Island with Hu Hanmin to plot their rescue. Sun Yat-sen happened to be in Penang at the time, so they convened a meeting at the Xin Guang Garden by the Tanjong Bungah beach to discuss the rescue. Hu Hanmin reported the details of their arrest, and when he mentioned that Wang Jingwei and Huang Fusheng had been sentenced to life imprisonment, he burst into tears and could not bear to look up. They immediately raised a thousand dollars and publicly elected Wu Shirong, Huang Jinqing, Hu Hanmin, and Chen Bijun to go to Singapore to raise more funds. They obtained another thousand dollars and took it to Hong Kong, where Li Zhongshi and others were in charge of contacting and arranging the rescue. While Hu Hanmin was weeping and his comrades were filled with grief and doing everything they could to rescue Wang Jingwei, Wang Jingwei was in prison in Beijing. According to the prison guards, Hu Hanmin had died in the Xin Hai Uprising on March 29th. Wang Jingwei cried bitterly and composed a poem:</p>
<p>"All my life I have been devoted to the revolution, I am glad that your wish has been fulfilled. But I pity the blood of two men, not flowing at the same time. Suddenly, I hate my remaining life, and I cherish my love for those who die after me. It is difficult to suppress the events of the past ten years, the tide rises to the top of my heart."</p>
<p>"Falling down, we meet for the first time, without words, our intentions have shifted. The strings and the leather are often worn interchangeably, and the glue and lacquer have never been separated. We carry food together in the morning when we are hungry, and we face each other at night when Han is exhausted. We share the joy of the cold season, and our affection is better than connected branches." "Every day I hear news from the Central Plains, and I cannot bear to hear it with a broken heart. My thoughts are futile and fleeting. Bats mourn the famous scholars, and mayflies sigh for the group. I remember gazing at the hometown together, and I am filled with sorrow for the countless clouds." He then heard that Hu Hanmin's death was not true, so he completed three poems and stopped writing. Soon after, the Wuchang Uprising succeeded, and Wang Jingwei and Huang Fusheng were spared from disaster. It is difficult for us to imagine the joy and comfort in the hearts of Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, and the comrades in the party at that time.</p>
<p>Alas! When national disasters strike, the primary condition for resisting foreign aggression lies in sincere unity. However, sincere unity and collaboration have been loudly proclaimed by both the government and the public, but what do the facts show? May this anecdote serve as the highest standard for today.</p>
<p>Brief News: At the "Big World" of the French Concession on Rue Cardinal Mercier, the strange Mr. Smagan Belier, who has traveled to Shanghai from America, has recently been hired to erect a seventy-foot-tall electric pole in the square. Starting at 9 PM on December 2nd, this person will ascend to the top of the pole and live there, exposed to the wind and dew, for seventy-eight days and nights before descending. Food and drink will be delivered by people in shifts. People who want to talk to him can use the telephone installed on the pole for communication. If you want to meet him in person, you can also ascend to the top of the pole. This person had previously experimented in the American capital, lasting for seventy-four days and nights, which made him famous all over the world. This time in China, he has prepared 10,000 foreign dollars, which are deposited in the "Big World" to guarantee that this undertaking is not a deception. Therefore, after ascending to the top of the pole, if anyone sees him descending privately and then ascending again, the money will be given to them.</p>
<p>Three Words and Two Phrases</p>
<p>— Bai Laixuan</p>
<p>What is love? According to the answer given by physiologist Thomson at a lecture at the Oxford Summer School, love contains three elements: (1) physiological needs; (2) mutual emotional attraction; and (3) intellectual harmony in terms of reason, will, and thought. He also said: "Being in love is the highest point of life."</p>
<p>An American university professor once said a word about mate choice: "Don't marry a woman whose 100-meter race exceeds 13 seconds."</p>
<p>The new historian Van Loon said this: "If there is no art and entertainment in the world, it is like a nursery without laughter."</p>

<p>Getting on the train is always like escaping a disaster, everyone competing to be first, no one willing to fall behind. If the people don't change, the stationmaster has no solution. "The net bag is worn out, the leather suitcase bumps the waist, and by the time you curse like a pig, it already hurts like hell!"</p>
<p>A young lady's canned food was scattered all over the place, in a pitiful state; however, there was trampling going on, and no one saw anything, stepping on the cans with their feet, their hearts set on getting on the train: the young man was said to be avoiding the suspicion of gender, and I had to comfort myself with my so-called "sweetheart" and lend a helping hand. A gentleman sitting in second class looked at me a few times and said in a low voice, "Trying to please the young lady, with bad intentions!" I have no defense!</p>

<p>Chapter 19: Desiring to Be Near, Yet Separating: Reminiscences in the Same Car; Half-Crying, Half-Laughing: Leaning on a Pillow, Sick in the Declining Autumn</p>
<p>Even if Ji Zhi had decided, I still had him in my heart, and I would definitely return to Haidian after staying in the city for a day or two, so he came to the long-distance bus station to wait for me. Things don't always happen so conveniently; he met me as soon as he arrived at the bus station. He must have come to the station several times. Looking at it this way, it is easy to imagine what he feels for me. Of course, I have a husband and cannot have outside intentions, but he put in so much effort to send me back to Haidian; perhaps he had something to say to me. I simply didn't give him a chance to say it, which is something I feel bad about. I don't know when he will be able to come to Haidian again. If he does come, I should be generous and say a few comforting words to him. However, this is a very big secret as a girl. Apart from thinking about it thoroughly myself, where can I talk about it with a second person? Since that day, a knot has been tied in my heart, and I feel very sorry for Gan Erye. At the same time, I also hear rumors that Gan Erye and his brothers are at odds, and losing his job was because he wanted to marry the eldest daughter of the Yang family. He swore that he would not return until he became rich and married Yang Guizhi. Now that Yang Guizhi has an owner, no matter how much money he has, he will not be able to marry her. Let's see if he comes back? Guizhi felt very uncomfortable hearing these words. She thought, I never thought that Gan Jizhi's feelings were so devoted, and he suffered such a great sacrifice for me. But what good did he get? But if he really suffered a sacrifice for me, he shouldn't have treated me with such a cold attitude at one time. Perhaps those outside rumors are false? Thinking this way, she secretly inquired many times, and the news became more and more real. Gan Jizhi really made a sacrifice for her. She thought that others had suffered such a great grievance, not only not getting any benefit from herself but also suffering her cold shoulder. (257)</p>
<h3 id="e268">A Record of Cherishing Autumn at Tianchi, Where My Footprints Have Reached <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Qianjiu</p>
<p>Tianchi Mountain is located in the southwest countryside of Suzhou. According to local records, it is called Hua Mountain because there is a pond on the top of the mountain, in which thousand-petal lotus flowers grow. Consuming them leads to ascension to immortality, hence the name Hua Mountain. At the summit of the mountain, there is a huge rock called Lotus Peak. It is also said that there is a stone drum on the mountain, which sounded during the reign of Emperor An of Jin, foretelling the rebellion of Sun En. It is further said that there is a pond halfway up the mountain, located on a steep cliff, horizontally immersed in the mountainside, spanning tens of feet, hence it is also known as Tianchi Mountain. Thus, the name Hua Mountain is no longer prominent.</p>
<p>Last week, when the autumn light was not yet old and the wind and sun were clear, my friend Ou Xia invited me to travel to Tianchi together. Ou Xia is good at climbing mountains and can take photographs. He recruited a boatman and prepared musical instruments, fruits, and bait, taking on the task single-handedly. Accompanying us were five beautiful women, named Ning, Yi, Ni, Lan, and Fen, with bright eyes, white teeth, delicate eyebrows, and vermilion lips, adding much color to the trip.</p>
<p>There are two paths from Suzhou to Tianchi: one is to disembark at Shanren Bridge, which takes longer by water but is closer to the mountain; the other is to disembark at Baima Stream, which is faster by boat but the mountain climb is slightly longer. To save time, we agreed to board the boat outside Changmen Gate, passing through Maple Bridge and the ancient Jin Bridge, arriving at Baima Stream after three hours. We disembarked from the iron boat, hired a guide, and headed towards Tianchi.</p>
<p>Soon, the mountain gradually rose higher. Climbing up the steps, we entered a stone archway. The guide said: "This is called Dongxia Cave." After entering the cave for only a few steps, there was a grand monument over ten feet tall, with three characters carved on it: "Tian Yi Ren." The characters were over a foot in size, in red, and their meaning was unknown. After clearing the weeds, we examined the seal inscription, which read: "Donation for the Reconstruction of Hejiu Ridge Monument." Circling upwards, we crossed another stone archway. The guide said: "This is Xihuan Cave." Emerging, we saw an ancient temple standing majestically against the mountain. Entering it, it was quiet and deserted. A Taoist priest sat quietly reading scriptures. When asked, he responded that this was the Puji Temple. Behind the temple, there was a stone with a poem inscribed by the famous Suzhou figure, Mr. Li Yinquan, which read: "Once, the King of Wu ascended this mountain to celebrate the Double Ninth Festival, hence the name of the ridge." Thus, I finally understood the origin of the name Hejiu Ridge. After a quick tour, we continued forward. The mountain became even higher, passing through ancient tombs, which were in a state of extreme disrepair. The grand monuments were broken in half, and the stone horses were separated. I wondered if those who had put so much effort into building them back then had ever anticipated the present state of affairs. Advancing further, the mountain path became narrower, and the mountain was even more dangerous. People walked among the bizarre rocks, calling out to each other, and climbed with great effort, leaving behind a snapshot of our climb, as it was not easy to reach the top.</p>
<p>Winding and turning, we reached Jujian Temple. In front of the temple, there was a stone house over ten feet high, with a stone-carved Buddha statue inside. The temple was very dilapidated in the past, but the current abbot has begun to rebuild it, changing its old appearance. The temple is located in the flat area in front of the mountain, with grotesque rocks surrounding it. The temple buildings extend to the left and right, and entering through a moon gate, the plaque reads "Deer Garden," with a couplet that reads: "Not Deer Garden, Not Home, Half an Acre of Sparse Fruit, Half an Acre of Flowers," which is delightful to recite. Walking along the corridor, there are three open halls where one can sit for a while. The buildings are newly built, and Mr. Li Yinquan has inscribed the plaque "Lotus Rock Piercing the Sky." In front of the hall, there is a thatched pavilion where one can enjoy tea, and next to the pavilion, there is a spring that gradually flows into a stone hole shaped like a begging bowl. Daoist Liaowuji wrote the three characters "Begging Bowl Spring," which are large enough to fill the entire space. Further flowing down, it is ejected from a stone dragon head. Jiang Zhaozhou of Xin'an praised it as "Tianchi's First Spring."</p>
<p>After resting for a while, we left the temple and ascended to the left. At this point, we were among the stone forest. What is the shape of the stones? They are strangely steep and dangerously odd and beautiful - that's somewhat can describe its very best. The road was also rugged and winding, making it even more difficult to walk. It became gradually more dangerous and harder the further we progressed. If one was not careful, their head would be crushed and their bones broken - especially the little ones. Before I and Ou Xia came, we heard that there have never been many people in ancient times who have climbed Lotus Peak, one because there is no path, and two because the mountain is dangerous. Moreover, today we are wearing leather shoes. But since we have already come, how can we not climb it? Therefore, we instructed the accompanying friends to wait on the mountainside, and I and Ou Xia used both hands and feet, climbing the rocks and grasping the grass, and used chalk to mark the path, recording the dangers and obstacles, and finally managed to climb to the Lotus Peak at the summit. The peak is a huge rock, as big as three houses. The two stones opposite it are slightly smaller. The two stones stand opposite each other, truly like a lotus flower spreading its petals. Standing and looking down, we only saw the rocks, and I am unable to describe all the said stones using anything beyond my inadequate writing. At that time, the mountain wind suddenly rose, blowing people to the point of falling, so we sat on the ground and slithered down, both our hands and feet were injured by thorns and brambles. Speaking of this to our companions, they were all amazed. Looking back at the top of the mountain, we were filled with attachment.</p>

<h3 id="e269">Financial Sentiment Weak, Maintaining Little Strength, Gold Price Drops Another $5.60 <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>The gold market was stable yesterday, then weakened again, unable to maintain stability. Public sentiment remained fearful and uncertain. HSBC's US dollar exchange rate rose by 375 points. Other firms continued to sell US dollars, but banks' appetite wasn't very strong, relying entirely on internal movements. Gold prices also declined continuously. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw British silver rise, and American silver also increased. Although the future silver price on the Five Metals Exchange rose, it wasn't by much, and the exchange rate was similar. London spot gold rose by half a penny. The US government bought newly mined gold at $34.01, up eight cents from the previous close. Stock prices rose and fell. There was news of US cotton rising eight pounds and US wheat shrinking by seventy-five. The news didn't have much impact, so the raw market opened stable, with prices above $700. Subsequently, due to supply at higher prices, it dropped by about $2, and the need to settle US dollars for April at $34.9375 kept it stable. After the opening, it rose due to bank settlements. HSBC's exchange rate was flat for British pounds and up 375 points for US dollars. After the announcement, sentiment weakened, and prices declined. Later, the internal market was strong, but banks' appetite turned sluggish, and at midday, it almost broke the $690 level. Reuters had no special news, and the trend seemed bad. Although there were many buyers in the market, due to the downward sentiment, there was little room for development. The price of蛤赤 was $1,065, and the swap spread was $8.50. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was $700, up $1.80 from the previous close. Commodities opened at the same price. The foreign exchange market opened with recent selling prices of British pounds at 1 shilling 3.375 pence and US dollars at $33.75. Hengyu, Zhaofeng, Changyuan, Shengyong, and others came in, gradually rising from $699.40 to $702. Zhengjin settled US dollars for April at 875 points. Commodities and the Dalian gang supplied, while Tongyi also sold, causing a downward trend. However, because Citibank and Macgregor settled US dollars for March at 75 points, expecting the US dollar exchange rate to rise by only 125 points, it hovered around $1. Unexpectedly, the second report came, with HSBC's exchange rate flat for British pounds and up 375 points for US dollars. A selling frenzy erupted, with Yuanchun, Hengyu, Zhichang all selling, causing it to fall to $698. Citibank settled US dollars for March at 75 points, and Changsheng Yong bought in, pulling it up to $1. Sentiment was extremely weak. Yongfeng, Hengyu, Daxingyong repeatedly sold down to the $6 level. Zhaofeng Chang Zhifeng Yong took advantage of the low prices to accept notes, and Citibank settled US dollars for April at 125 points, recovering to above $7. However, Yidayong, Yuanchun, and Daxingyong sold again, resulting in $5.50. Citibank ate US dollars for February at 5625 points, remaining stable. Later, banks and brokers all settled US dollars for March at 8125 points, mutually trading and causing fluctuations. Richang, Yidayong, Hengyu, Xiangyu, Shunli slightly advanced. At this point, there seemed to be an improvement, but the internal market hardened again. Shunli, Yidayong, Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Richang, Dafayong, and others repeatedly sold, causing it to fall to $3.30. Zhengjin had settled US dollars for February at 6875 points. Commodities showed some absorption, briefly recovering by more than $1. Sentiment was exhausted and unsustainable. Hanh Heng Hongli jointly sold notes, causing it to fall to 05 cents. Shanghai settled US dollars for March at 0625, but Hengyu took advantage of the low prices to buy continuously. Fuyu, Huixiang, Yifengyong, Shentai, Chunyuan Yong, and others bought in succession. At midday, it recovered to $692.60. After the close, Yidayong and Cuitailai sold back to $2, Wanxing and others bought in, and it recovered to around $3. The highest price for the first half of the day was $702, and the lowest was $690.50, a difference of $11.50. As a result, it fell $5.60 from the previous close.</p>
<p>The announced exchange rate was $33.375 for HSBC's US dollar, up 375 points, equating to a gold price of $719. Based on the closing price, it was about $6 lower, approximately $2 less than the previous close. The book price for this month was $699, and for January, it was $693. The morning makeup water was $699. The蛤赤 price was $1,065. Trading in the market was calm. The Tianjin gang sold at $1,069 and bought at $1,070, all done by firms for about 2,000 taels. Dalian goods were taken in by Tongfengyong, Yingfengheng, and others, about 1,000 taels, at prices ranging from $1,066 to $1,067.

<p>The Foreign Exchange fell back slightly by one jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the gradual filling of positions and tranquil market conditions, sentiment was also slightly lax and not as tense as in the previous few days. Therefore, the market price contracted. The early market only opened at 1 jiao 3 fen, a sharp decrease of 7 fen from the previous day. The midday market decreased by another 3 fen, with only 1 jiao in transactions, a large difference of 1 jiao compared to the previous day's price.

<h3 id="e274">The Bizarre Public Debt Market of Securities, Rumors Abound, Market Changes in an Instant, Sharp Advances and Retreats Result in a Slight Increase <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange became increasingly chaotic. The suddenness of the rises and falls changed in an instant. The front and rear market prices were diametrically opposed. Rumors were fabricated according to the highs and lows of the market prices. The story of the Guangdong faction being assigned to Fujian was confirmed to be inaccurate. It seemed that war was still unavoidable, but the market price seemed to temporarily break away from the lure of the environment and rise in an unconscious frenzy. It was said that the new number four was greatly increasing the short covering, which was false. It was said to be a deliberate attempt to confuse the audience, but who was the victim? The more bizarre and strange, the more elusive it became. At the initial auction in the morning, the current month's Compilation and Remittance were slightly raised, seemingly due to organized price increases. Therefore, each item rose afterward without exception, with the Salt Tax even increasing by 1 yuan and 8 jiao, which was unexpected. Upon careful examination, the likely reason was that numbers 11 and 50 were covering shorts, and number 4 had a lot of buying. The sellers temporarily avoided their edge, so the demand suddenly exceeded the supply, causing a rebound. Retail investors on the trading floor were also very eager to cover shorts. In the second round of trading, after 1:00 PM, market prices continued to rise, with the wind being very strong, and there was a tendency to soar. However, the situation in the environment did not allow for such a rapid and vigorous rebound. Therefore, it caused the big players to sell. Therefore, the 18th and 19th years rose several jiao to 1 yuan and 4 jiao. Starting from the 20th year, due to the large volume of selling by number 5, it suddenly turned sluggish, with the 20th Volume falling by 5 jiao. After entering, it fell more and more severely, with some falling by 1 yuan and 5 jiao and a half. The front and rear market prices were reversed, with a very large difference. Rumors abounded for a time, some saying that the political situation would still undergo major changes, and others saying that the Wenzhou telegraph was out of order and that the Southwest had made five more demands. The market atmosphere turned tense. In the afternoon, there was still only one round. The auction started after 5:00 PM. Therefore, the market price fell by 1-2 yuan due to the selling by the [客帮] Ke Bang. After that, the various types of the 20th year fell less because the upper round had already fallen. The Comprehensive Tax and those after it were still good, rising by 1 jiao to 4 jiao. The Dong family used numbers 11 and 50 to cover shorts, while number 4 continued to buy. Throughout the day, the ability to transform was extremely variable. The extent of the deceit was still a slight increase compared to the previous day, ranging from 1-2 jiao to 7-8 jiao. 金长 [Jin Chang] rebounded by about 1 yuan because it had fallen too much the day before, but the Remittance still fell by 3-5 jiao. The total number of transactions was estimated to be around 35 million yuan.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported on the 1st that the New York stock market first rose due to a slight increase in gold prices and a lack of sellers, but then fell due to profit-taking by bulls and the transfer of US dollars back. Speculators believed that the scattered buying of automobile stocks was the most significant development of the day, recalling the situation when the automobile industry led the United States out of the 1921 recession. With the expected large increase in automobile production next spring, they couldn't help but feel that history might repeat itself. The demand for steel stocks was also broad, as the industry has made considerable progress recently and is showing a trend of mergers and industry concentration. The total number of transactions for the day was 810,000 shares. Wheat and wheat were slightly lower due to heavy rains in the southern drought areas, weak Liverpool market conditions, and increased wheat exports from the Soviet Union. "Cotton" trading was thin, with minimal ups and downs, still controlled by exchange rates. Spot prices will obviously hover around 1 jiao, waiting for future development. The Financial Aftermath Agency purchased gold at a price of 34.01 yuan per tael, up 8 fen. The Dow Jones indexes are listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is filled with rumors about the current situation, and sentiment is panicked. The bulls in a certain factory continued to be cut and settled in batches, and the market turned straight down. This month's new low was discovered, at 172.5 yuan, and one standard yuan was only 123 taels 3 qian 3 fen. According to the lowest point of the 16-count Indian yarn standard in the Republic of China year 15, the lowest point was 122 taels 1 qian. The recent falling wind is terrifying, completely because it has been held for too long. Once it breaks out, it is difficult to contain.

<p>The cotton market was flat in the morning and sluggish in the afternoon. As the yarn market continued to decline, the factory purchases were quite sluggish, and Japanese merchants, seeing that foreign cotton prices were cheaper, had no intention of buying local cotton. Therefore, the stockpiles in the producing areas increased, and there was a lack of outlets. Credit tightened, and there were more sellers. However, general cotton merchants in the city still bought in and added more to their long positions.</p>

<p>A New York telegram dated December 1 reported on the cotton market for the week, stating that the cotton market was particularly uneven last week, with the reaction of the gold yuan causing many bulls in the December period to settle, but when prices fell by 30 pounds, the amount was absorbed. Afterwards, the gold yuan softened again and became firm. Southern supply was blocked due to falling prices, which was affected by the 1 jiao per pound collateral. The week's sentiment was quite focused on currency conditions and gold yuan fluctuations, but industry insiders paid attention to the statistical position. The estimated total number of cotton being restricted totaled about 6 million bales, but some people thought that this number might be excessive. The agricultural consolidation authority said that under the planting reduction plan for the next season, 15 million acres of cotton fields will be leased, so the next season's cotton production will reach 8 million bales. Cotton goods are quiet and stable, and factories are unwilling to lower prices.</p>

<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, each month presented a pattern of first flatness followed by stability. Foreign wheat prices, Chicago was also small by about 2467 jiao, and Canadian was small by 2 jiao. Therefore, after opening prices, each month tended to be small-faced, smaller by 1 fen or half a fen compared to the previous day. Afterwards, because factories didn't sell, and buyers inside and outside the industry were quite active, the market atmosphere turned stable again. In the afternoon, after opening, it was initially very flat, but later, because the Northern route [客帮] Ke Bang had a slight appetite, and it was rumored that Shanghai flour could be directly loaded in Dalian, which would naturally attract people's attention at this time when existing flour was still lacking. Therefore, the market on the market in each month gradually opened up and improved. Looking at the current situation, it was heard that major factories were not pessimistic and had been purchasing during low times. Perhaps the later steps would re-enter the popular path. It can also be said that, as a result, this month was 1.5 fen better than the previous day, January and February were 2 fen better, March was 1.75 fen better, and April and May were each 2.25 fen better.</p>

<p>Yesterday in the futures wheat market, after the opening in the morning, each month initially presented a pattern of near stability and distant settlement. This month, local wheat has entered a period of decline, and arrivals have not been surging. Furthermore, both goods and customers are thinking of selling, so the market is good. Distant months were initially still not excited, but later there were very few selling goods, and buyers gradually increased prices, so the market slightly increased. Until the opening in the afternoon, the market atmosphere this month was good because the buyers were very popular, and the opening price was good. Distant months also saw rising prices because the flour market was already hot. According to the current situation, half of it is related to the current situation, and half of it depends on how flour sales go. As a result, this month was 4 fen better than the previous day, January was up 8 fen, February was 4 fen better, and March was 6 fen better. The rest were mixed. Spot goods were not sold due to lack of arrivals and sales, and there was no trading.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Sources from each gang were slightly scarce, with 40-50 ships arriving (6,000-7,000 shi). Among them, the late rice market initially appeared sluggish, but later, because the [客家] Kejia were planning to transport and supplement cargo on Saturday, they competed with each other. At this time, the sellers also took the opportunity to tighten prices because the arriving goods were relatively scarce, so the market suddenly improved, appearing to be rising. However, in the end, because people's hearts were still difficult to establish after being exhausted for a long time, the overall situation was still only an image of settlement. It is estimated that each gang, including Northern and Southern Ocean Silver Gangs, entered a total of 3-4,000 bags, and looking ahead and behind, it still depends on the transfer to Sunday to determine its trend. The volume of sticky粳 [jīng] rice and 杜洋 [Duyang] 洋店 [foreign stores] of each gang was similar to yesterday, but because the goods were scarce, it also turned stable. The陰 [Yin] price 元 [Yuan] followed without honor or disgrace. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, the goods arriving in Hexia and other places were 41-42 ships, and market sales were still sluggish. The market price of new粳 [jīng] early thin rice白 [bai]元 [Yuan] was slightly cheaper by about 1 jiao. 羊 [Yang] 杜 [Du] 埠 [Bu]客 [Ke]秈 [xian] rice also showed several points of reduction, and破 [po]粳 [jīng] rice was still stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market situation for客秈 rice turned sluggish again. This was because the Nanyang (Southeast Asian) merchants completely stopped trading. The Guangdong merchants, in addition to directly handling shipments, also focused on various尖 (high-quality) rice types from 河下 (He Xia). The Fujian merchants, due to the influence of the political situation and the economy, unanimously stopped operations in Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Xinghua. Most of them were quietly waiting for opportunities and temporarily advocated a wait-and-see attitude. However, the Fujian merchants' needs were quite strong, so they may not be able to hold out for long. Yesterday, the Nanyang, Fujian, and Guangdong merchants all had no transactions. Only the Beiyang (Northern) merchants still had a strong appetite for Hunan machine-processed red rice. Yesterday, they selected another 154 bags, with the price still at the previously offered 7 yuan. There were no other buyers for 客秈 rice. This firm shipped 100 bags of Wuxi machine-processed 元 rice at a price of 8 yuan 1 jiao 4 fen. The Ningbo merchants shipped 150 bags of Hunan machine-processed 元 rice at a price of 7 yuan 6 jiao. Rice market prices were similar to the previous market, but without the Southern merchants' activity, it would be difficult for the market to rebound.</p>

<p>The supply of new red grain in this city is quite abundant. Although the Niuzhuang goods are off the market, their sales are limited to the inland distilleries, and the market situation has not changed much. Yesterday, over 200 bags of冲 red shell aged grain were transacted at a price of 3 yuan 2 fen. The new crop has already entered the market from the production areas. Due to pricing disagreements, shipments have only recently begun to arrive successively. Up to now, about 30 to 40 carts have accumulated. The quality of the goods is still good, but the difference between buying and selling prices is too large, preventing trading from starting. Industry insiders say that their price is not much different from aged grain. Unfortunately, the only outlet is the inland market, so future prospects are likely not optimistic.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a gradual decline due to sluggish trading. The guild only allocated a few dozen bags of 本棧 (local warehouse) goods of No. 24 coarse granulated white普通莊 sugar at a price of 20 yuan, which was 5 gong (unit of weight) lower than the previous day. Medium granulated white, Dutch red, and other sugars were quoted at the original prices without any changes. 太古 Sugar B mark was slightly lowered by 1 jiao, quoted at 20 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen, but also lacked transactions. Kwong Kee’s own factory’s fine white sugar was quoted at 18 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen, slightly down by 5 fen, but no sales were made. Chaoqing sugar only sold a few dozen bags of aged goods at a price of 14 yuan 8 jiao.</p>

<p>Sichuan榨菜 (pickled mustard tuber) had its price once increased to 33 yuan due to prolonged lack of new arrivals and limited inventory, and because a certain firm had been buying them up. But recently, due to tight credit and slow sales, it has softened slightly, dropping by 1 yuan. The market price has also fallen from 30 yuan to 29 yuan, with subsequent prices similarly reduced.</p>

<p>The trading of foreign boards has recently seen a rise in price because machine shops and客 merchants are buying them up, leading to insufficient market supply. Furthermore, new arrivals are not frequent, so market prices are rising steadily. Current market prices are as follows: 3/8 inch, estimated at 8 yuan 3 jiao; 5/8 inch, 1/4 inch, 1/8 inch, estimated at 7 yuan 1 jiao; 5/8 inch, 1/16 inch, 6 yuan 9 jiao; 5/8 inch, 1 inch, 1/16 inch, 6 yuan 9 jiao 5 fen. Yesterday's market saw sales of over 800 sheets.</p>

<p>The market for local factory元釘 (wire nails) has seen a weakening in unofficial prices recently because news of Eastern goods arriving has caused local sentiment to weaken and the market to become sluggish. As a result, unofficial prices have softened secretly. The price for each keg of 倍司 grade is estimated at 6 yuan 9 jiao, which is 3 jiao lower than before. Transactions have not increased as a result. It is said that people's spirits remain low, so the market outlook remains uncertain.</p>

<p>The 輯里 silk prices in England have sharply declined again. The market in England has recently seen sluggish sales of silk fabrics. Japanese silk has repeatedly been devalued to seek sales. Chinese silk is expensive and no one is asking about it. Silk prices are declining steadily. Yesterday, this firm received confirmed news from 寨和 foreign firm that 碩果 silk prices in England had declined sharply again. A-grade 繡麟飞鳥 brand was only offered at 7 shillings per pound, B-grade 黑狮 brand was only 6 shillings 6 pence, each down 3 pence from the beginning of the week.</p>
<p>Sales of American-bound 黄厂 silk have stopped. The sales of Sichuan, Shandong, and Hubei 黄厂 silk to England, America, and France have completely stopped. Last month (November) a total of only 36 bales of small truck silk were shipped to India. Not a single shipment went to New York, Lyon, or London.</p>
<p>Sales of rayon to 客 merchants are sluggish. With the introduction of cotton and wool fabrics, the demand for rayon has further decreased. There are no sales to 客 merchants. Yesterday, only hosiery factories purchased 14 boxes of available goods of the 飞鹰 (Flying Eagle) and 双雀 (Double Sparrow) brands, priced at 174 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen to 161 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen net.</p>
<p>Small telegrams from overseas indicate quiet silk prices and increasing overseas inventories. Current silk prices are surprisingly low. New York standard silk prices are equivalent to only about 440 yuan per bale in Chinese currency. Lyon ordinary silk prices are also only about 600 yuan. Sales in the county are unlikely to rebound. The cost of silk held by manufacturers in Shanghai is 800-900 yuan, resulting in huge losses. Therefore, they are mortgaging to the financial community and waiting for the right opportunity. This week, foreign firms have not received any indications of improved overseas silk sales. Yesterday morning, the market remained sluggish. Only 印旺 and other firms sold 5 bales each of 道黄厂 silk, 白乾罗 silk, and 20 bales of gray silk, all at sluggish prices.</p>

<p>World Language Research Special Issue Confucius said: Today, the world, write the same script.</p>
<h3 id="e294">世界語的吏命丨與丨一個問題 <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— 公樸</p>
<p>Last time, this publication issued a special issue on Basic English to meet the needs of readers. At the same time, it was decided that from this issue, several special issues on Esperanto would be published, because the latter's history and scope, as well as its status in international linguistics, far exceed the former. Therefore, there are also more submissions. As for why we advocate the study of this international linguistics, it is because in recent years, Esperanto's position internationally has been steadily increasing, and there are more and more books and newspapers that use Esperanto to express opinions. The organization of Esperanto societies can be said to have spread throughout the world, especially in countries with oppressed and small ethnic groups. An Esperantist can freely travel to various countries, and everywhere they go they can meet good friends who treat them equally and without racial prejudice - comrades of Esperanto. Because the purpose of the creator of Esperanto is to break down one of the biggest obstacles to international communication - the barrier of language. We know that many, many misunderstandings and hatreds internationally are caused by language barriers. Because Esperanto's purpose is like this, genuine comrades who understand the true meaning of Esperanto, when they meet, do not have the various misunderstandings that commonly occur when two foreigners meet, and the various prejudices caused by different historical backgrounds of different ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Today, China is in the position of a semi-colonial and small ethnic group. We will not ask for liberation if we have not, but if we want to engage in resisting this current state of international oppression, if we want to implement Mr. Sun Yat-sen's words - unite with nations that treat us equally and with the weak and small ethnic groups around the world to fight together - then advocating the study of Esperanto can not only be an important tool for uniting, but can also increase the revolutionary consciousness of the Chinese people. We know that Esperanto is the most scientific and easiest to learn language today. In China, where the majority of people are illiterate, in addition to popularizing our country's applied writing, if we want to advocate that the Chinese people should still learn several foreign languages, then the reporter believes that we should first learn Esperanto, because no matter English, French, Russian, German, etc., they are all not as easy to learn as Esperanto. At the same time, in addition to working hard to eradicate illiteracy, we should at least encourage the Chinese people to learn a foreign language - especially Esperanto. With the tool of Esperanto, on the one hand, we can understand the international situation that is oppressing us, and on the other hand, we can consolidate the front of weak and small ethnic groups around the world to resist together.</p>
<p>However, the reporter wants to solemnly declare that although the above text vigorously promotes Esperanto, the reporter is still a layman when it comes to Esperanto. However, sympathizing with the creator of Esperanto's grand vision and being determined to learn this unique international language has been around for thirteen or fourteen years, not just since today. But precisely because I am a layman, now there is a question that I might as well take this opportunity to ask the advanced comrades who have already learned Esperanto and have submitted articles. This question is how to give people who have learned Esperanto sufficient opportunities to practice, so as not to become rusty and eventually completely forget it. The reporter recently met Mr. Wang Yunwu, who had studied Esperanto, and asked for his opinion on Esperanto. Mr. Wang said, my Esperanto is completely forgotten, because there are too few opportunities to practice, so he feels that a language must have sufficient practical opportunities, and these opportunities are best to be very natural. In other words, there are many, many people who understand Esperanto, and then learners can easily encounter opportunities to learn anytime, anywhere. If not, there is always the possibility of becoming rusty and forgetting. However, Mr. Wang's learning was many years ago, so what is the situation now? How to solve this problem, I hope Esperanto comrades will write articles to answer this in the next special issue.</p>
<h3 id="e295">世界語構造的優點 <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— 顧亦男女士</p>
<p>Since the 17th century, there have been hundreds of artificial international language proposals. Among these hundreds of proposals, only Esperanto, first created by Zamenhof, has obtained the unique status of an international language and has been developing indefinitely in practical use by the general public in various aspects around the world. The most important reason why Esperanto has been able to defeat all other international language proposals and be supported and used by the general public around the world is the advantages of Esperanto's own structure: simple, easy to learn, and suitable for application in any aspect.</p>
<p>There are a total of twenty-eight letters in Esperanto. Except for the five letters A, E, I, O, and U, which are vowels, the rest are consonants. Whether vowels or consonants, each letter has only one sound, and there are no exceptions such as long or short sounds. One sound is also only represented by one letter. This is the so-called "one letter, one sound; one sound, one letter," so Esperanto is the most ideal writing system in terms of pronunciation.</p>
<p>The stress in Esperanto single words, unlike in English, varies from word to word and is unpredictable. The stress in Esperanto single words is always on the second-to-last vowel, without exception. For example, the word Lumo (light) has two vowels, U and O, and its stress is on the second-to-last vowel, U, and never changes.</p>
<p>In Esperanto, nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs all have fixed endings, unlike in other writing systems where they are elusive and vary from place to place. In Esperanto, the ending of a noun is O, the ending of a verb is I, the ending of an adjective is A, and the ending of an adverb is E: it can be understood at a glance.</p>
<p>In Esperanto, there are fixed endings to indicate plurals, unlike in English and other writing systems where there are many exceptions (such as the plural of Man is not Mans but Men). The plural ending in Esperanto is J, without exception. For example, "one book" is Libro, and more than one book is Libroj.</p>
<p>In other writing systems, especially German and French, every noun has a "gender." For example, in French, the word "Japan" (Japon) is masculine, and the word "China" (Chine) is feminine. There is no such irrational distinction of gender in Esperanto.</p>
<p>In Esperanto, the accusative case has a fixed ending, without exception. For example, if you say "John hits Peter," in Esperanto it would be JohanobatasPetron. Jobano is "John," batas is "hits," and Petro is "Peter." The N after oPetron is the accusative case ending. You can tell at a glance that the person being hit is Peter, not John. Because there is this accusative case ending, the order of words in an Esperanto sentence can be freely changed as needed without being misunderstood. For example, the sentence above can also be written as PetronbatasJohancoPetro. Because there is an accusative case ending after Petro, it is not misunderstood as "Peter hits John." This cannot be done in other writing systems.</p>
<p>There are a total of twelve numerals in Esperanto: "one" is unu, "two" is du, "three" is tri, "four" is kvar, "five" is kvin... "ten" is dek, "hundred" is cent, and "thousand" is mil. For example, "five thousand four hundred thirty-two" is simply kvinmilkvarcenttridekdu, exactly the same as Chinese. In English, "five" is frve and "ten" is ten, but "fifteen" is fifteen d, not tenfrve. "Fifty" is frfty, not fiveten. And French is even more stupid, they don't know how to say "eighty," they have to say "two forties." Esperanto has no such drawbacks: "fifteen" is dekkvin and "fifty" is kvindek, which is very simple and logical.</p>
<p>Prefixes and suffixes in Esperanto have very ingenious effects. For example, the word bona means "good." Simply add mal (a prefix meaning "opposite") and malbona becomes "bad." granda means "big" and malgranda means "small." Also, knabo is "boy." Just add in (a suffix indicating "feminine") and knabino becomes "girl." claboristo is "male worker" and laboristino is "female worker."</p>
<p>As long as it makes sense in terms of meaning, two or more words in Esperanto can be combined to form compound words. For example, the roots fer (iron) and voj (road) can be combined to form fervojo (railway). The roots oskrib (write) and tabl (table) can be combined to form skribtablo (writing desk). okvin (five), jar (year), and plan (plan) can be combined to form kvinjarplano (five-year plan).</p>
<p>Having understood the various advantages mentioned above, we can know that Esperanto's ability to defeat other international languages is by no means accidental. These advantages make Esperanto an extraordinarily regular, simple, and easy-to-learn language, and further guarantee its past, present, and future victory!</p>

<p>— 尚可鈞</p>
<p>Except for the "Northern Bear", the vast majority of people, whether in advanced or backward countries, are being harmed by the magic hand of economic panic, especially the masses of semi-colonial China, who are suffering even more under the oppression of imperialist privilege holders. However, at the same time, this oppression is also promoting the connection of the Chinese masses, who are trying hard to struggle out from under the stone slab.</p>
<p>Because the connection of the masses is so important, although in this world with developed transportation, imperialist privilege holders cannot cut off the mutual contact of the masses, they are always trying to prevent this connection. When they see that the masses in various parts of the world still have difficulty communicating in language, they are very happy. Language barriers simply mean that even if the masses in various places meet, they have no way to precisely discuss how to solve their own pressing problems.</p>
<p>However, the daydreams of all privilege holders were finally awakened by the real world. "Esperanto" (Esperanto) has after all defeated all the international language proposals of the utopianists and has won the unanimous support of the majority of people in the world.</p>
<p>But there are also people who think: "Esperanto" has nothing to do with China. The Chinese masses are overwhelmingly illiterate. They have no chance to even learn the national language, so how can they learn "Esperanto"? Therefore, we must wait until the Chinese masses have solved the problems of the nation and themselves before we can learn "Esperanto".</p>
<p>These words seem quite reasonable at first glance, but the people who advocate this are truly the so-called "knowing one thing, but not knowing the other". The masses are demanding a solution to the problems of the nation and themselves, and the masses will inevitably find a solution. But how to get a solution? In order to gain freedom and equality, the Chinese masses must, as Mr. Sun Yat-sen said, use various methods to "unite the nations of the world that treat us equally" and the countless brothers and sisters in the world who are suffering the same plight, to "fight together." And in this international "union", the international language "Esperanto" has a very great significance. "Esperanto" is by no means a pastime for the masses after they have been liberated. "Esperanto" is a necessary tool for the "common struggle" of the masses around the world. The Chinese masses, who are on the move, must undoubtedly learn to use this language tool! "Esperanto."</p>
<p>Naturally, after the masses have achieved their goals, "Esperanto" will advance toward its future at an astonishing pace. At that time, "Esperanto" will reach the most perfect and abundant state, becoming the only language of mankind in a great community society, because of the collective creation of the masses of the world.</p>
<h3 id="e298">基本英語一世界語的比較 <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— 施豫</p>
<p>(一) Comparison of Pronunciation</p>
<p>Esperanto pronunciation can be considered the most ideal and in line with phonetics. Because it uses one letter to represent one sound, and one sound is only represented by one letter. Therefore, each letter has its own sound, with no change. Learning the pronunciation of its twenty-eight letters will allow you to accurately read any Esperanto word, regardless of whether you have read it before. Its stress is also fixed, always on the second-to-last vowel.</p>
<p>English completely lacks this advantage. English pronunciation is one of the most difficult of all European languages. Its Basic English fully inherits its weaknesses, without improvement.</p>
<p>For example, the K sound in Esperanto is contained in four letters in Basic English, such as: C in Come, K in drink, Q in Qujte, and X in Erchange. Also, F and ph both sound F, and Gh sometimes also sounds F, such as Rough. S and C both sound S, and X also contains the S sound, and so on.</p>
<p>This is the use of different letters to represent the same sound. There are also instances of one letter representing several sounds, such as C in Circle, where the first sound is S and the second sound is K; S in Business, where the first S is pronounced Z and the last two S's are pronounced as one, and so on. A letter can also contain two sounds, such as X. Two letters combined can represent one sound, such as ph, and so on. There are even letters that are not pronounced, such as gh in Night and K and D in Knowledge, and so on. The above examples are only for consonants and are already numerous.</p>
<p>As for vowels, there are twelve pure vowels in English, and with diphthongs there are a total of twenty-one, in addition to triphthongs. So the confusion in their representation is even more severe than with consonants. For example, ai in Said is equal to E in end, O in not is equal to A in Was, but not equal to O in do, nor equal to O in No; OO in Good is equal to U in Puh, but not equal to OO in Food; A in Ball is equal to or in Form, but not equal to A in Back or A in Last; ou in Touch is equal to U in But, but not equal to ou in Out; U in But is also not equal to U in Pull; I in Fightr is equal to Y in My, but not equal to I in It; E in Me is equal to EE in Week and ea in Please, but not equal to E in Let, and so on.</p>
<p>In addition, the stress also varies from front to back and has no fixed position, which needs no further examples. So Basic English, like Standard English, requires a lot of time to memorize the spelling and stress in addition to memorizing the pronunciation and meaning of each new word. It is impossible to read a new word that has not been read before without consulting a dictionary or asking a teacher.</p>
<p>(二) Comparison of Grammar</p>
<p>Let's compare the second chapter of the "Basic English Grammar" with Esperanto.</p>
<p>(1) For plural nouns, add SO, but there are 7% formal exceptions and 6 types of spelling exceptions. Esperanto adds J without exception.</p>
<p>In 50% of the nouns, you can add endings to form four types of transformed words. In Esperanto, under the logical permission of meaning, any word root can be added with endings to form various parts of speech; or with prefixes and suffixes to form words with various new meanings.</p>
<p>(2) The comparative form of an adjective is to add More (comparative) or Most (superlative). However, some add er or est to the end of the word. In addition, there are two exceptions. Esperanto adds pll (comparative) or picj (superlative) uniformly.</p>
<p>When an adjective becomes a word, ly is added to the end of the word, but there are three types of exceptions. In Esperanto, in addition to basic non-ending adverbs, any word root can be added with the ending E to form an adverb.</p>
<p>(3) The singular of the present tense of a verb has a distinction between the first and second person and the third person, and there are four exceptions to the method of distinguishing them. The third person has a distinction between singular and plural, while the first and second persons do not, but there is still one exception. In Esperanto, there is neither a distinction in number nor a distinction in person, and the ending as is added uniformly after the word root.</p>
<p>The present tense and past tense of verbs are completely the same, some add a final syllable, some change one or two letters, and some completely drop a word. And its future tense changes to use the method of auxiliary verbs. Esperanto uses endings to indicate them uniformly, present as, past is, future os: absolutely no exceptions.</p>
<p>The human imperative of verbs uses the singular form of the first person, but there is still one exception. Esperanto has no exceptions, and uses the ending U uniformly.</p>
<p>The formation of participles also has no fixed method and varies completely from word to word. In Esperanto, the endings ant (present), int (past), and ont (future) are used uniformly.</p>
<p>(4) The comparative form of adverbs has five exceptions. In Esperanto, like dealing with adjectives, pli or plej are added uniformly.</p>
<p>(5) The accusative case of pronouns sometimes uses the original form of the nominative case, and sometimes changes it, depending on the word. The changes in the possessive case also have no fixed guidelines. The possessive cases of Esperanto pronouns all add the ending a, and the accusative cases all add the ending n, without exception.</p>
<p>(三) Comparison of Vocabulary</p>
<p>If a language only has eight hundred and fifty words, then its ease of learning is inherently credible. But people can forcibly reduce the number of words; but no one can pull the world of the twentieth century back to the primitive world of ancient times. Mr. Ogden can limit the types of fruits to only four, birds and beasts to nine, and insects to three in Basic English, but he cannot extinguish or exterminate the rest of the fruits, birds and beasts, and insects, or prohibit anyone from mentioning them.</p>
<p>Originally, the size of the vocabulary should be tailored to life.</p>
