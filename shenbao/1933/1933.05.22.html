<h3 id="c32">和平軍縮 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— 實</p>
<p>北美合衆總統羅斯福。前瞻世界經濟會議。固抱樂觀。英美兩國。亦具諒解。世界經濟前途。似可於恐慌中打開一新局面。然而政治危機。四處潛伏。戰爭禍亂之機。匪特隱現於歐洲。且已顯露於東亞。以故羅斯福氏欲制機先。乃先提和平宣言。幷贊成英首相麥克唐納之軍縮提案。以消除當前政治危機之深化。藉以奠定世界經濟之基礎。其用心誠苦。其行爲亦至善也。惟吾人於世界現勢。不能不有相當認識。以免事實之誤認。尤其是政治上之糾紛。不宜輕易看過。否則　令暫歸平靜。終必至於發生意外。是則吾人所希望於美總統之注意者也。</p>
<p>溯自本年三月初旬。日内瓦軍備縮小會議。殆已瀕於半身不遂之狀。迨至英相提出具體軍縮案之後。德國旣堅持「軍備平等。」法國又必欲「保障安全。」日本復又猛烈施行其軍事侵略。致和平益陷於僵局。英相羅馬之行。英意諒解。似將成功。歐洲糾紛。或可得一相對諒解之結果。但德意認爲適當。法國則以爲有損其安全。而波蘭·捷克·羅尼亞·等國。尤各持異議。前路崎嶇。恐仍不少阻滯。故四大强國協調案。終以法國之不快。德國之執拗。小協商國之反對而擱淺。</p>
<p>吾人固審知軍備縮小問題之焦點。端在歐洲。而尤以法德兩國對立之衝突爲甚。蓋德國高倡德意志民族之復興。於所謂「廻廊」地域再三致意。於是「軍備平等」之要求。遂爲國家社會黨「國策」之一。而日内瓦之軍縮會議。更大受挫折矣。</p>
<p>美總統宣言維護和平。幷望各國能接受本年三月十六英相麥唐納所提示之軍備縮小案。吾人回憶兩月餘以前。德國對陸空軍之制限。堅持不滿。該案竟歸停頓。希特勒之威脅。致惹起英法之不快。德意志所得。幾等於零。而世界經濟。乃益惡化。以故美總統提議普遍的軍縮後。德國遂不能不表示接受。以顯其溫和精神。免陷於國際的孤立。是以歐洲大陸在緊張空氣中。復現出一線和平之希望也。</p>
<p>獨遠東形勢。則大異於是。日本軍國主義者。仍持其歷來侵略手段。表面上贊成「非戰公約」之强力化。對各國互不侵略之約束。亦甚贊同。但保留其所謂「自衛權之行使。」更有甚者。竟以遠東特殊情形爲例外。而武裝軍隊擅越國境之舉。乃係以軍隊爲警察之活動。此種保留條件。設使成立。則匪特世界和平。悉被破壞。而國際軍縮。亦徒託空談。况事實上歐洲大陸。雖暗雲低迷。而平和狀態。猶未衝破。至於遠東。則日人早已發動武力。今且逐步進行侵略。以遂其蠶食之野心。如是而欲望其軍備之縮小。和平之成功難矣。</p>

<p>（柏林）　本日意相墨索里尼與英法兩國駐意大使會晤之後、柏林某通信社宣稱、據羅馬消息、似四强條約之談判、旦夕可告成功、又謂情形如此、則普魯士總理戈林之在羅馬、其關係可謂非常重大、該通信社又謂、據消息靈通者言、在二十四點鐘以後、德國對于四强條約、將宣佈贊成、德國一經贊成、則該條約即告完成矣、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　關於四强條約之談話仍繼續進行、意相墨索里尼所提之草案似已進入最後之階段、墨索里尼於接見普魯士總理戈林時、曾以渠與英法兩國大使談話情形告之、戈林於本日啓程回柏林、意大利人士均抱樂觀、謂四强之間、如果訂立條約、須於倫敦經濟會議開會之先訂立之、衆咸以爲四强此種誠意之表示、可使倫敦會議易於成功、昨日意相墨索里尼對各方意見紛歧之點、極力幹旋、求其接近、此事進行似已大有進展、聞條約草案除正文之外、尙有序言云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　意相墨索里尼發起之英法德意四國公約、因普魯士邦總理戈林突至羅馬、復爲人所注意、戈林昨日抵此、初傳乃來參加關於民用飛機技術問題之討論、戈林今已晉見意相一二次、談話内容、甚爲秘密、謠傳此行與四國公約有關、羅馬數界人士之意見、以爲公約成敗之樞紐、現操於德人之手云、（二十日路透電）</p>

<p>日本自從退出國際聯盟以後、他國内對於這個問題、就有兩種不同的見解、一種是急進論、對軍事上主張積極實行其大陸政策、北拒蘇聯、南侵中國、在外交上則繼續顓頇、支持所謂「焦土外交」、保持他所謂的孤立、對内則力行軍閣影響下的協力内閣、縱使表面上不露出否定議會政治的痕跡、但却竭力說明延長非常時局面之必要、幷且以兵力趕造非常局面、其他一種是穩健愼重論、他們對於軍事上、以爲如此已足、該保持勝利的頂點、不宜再事燥進、萬一碰着阻礙、是很不値得的、何况國際間和平空氣的醞釀、也很濃厚、假使日本眞正孤立、殊爲不智、</p>
<p>前一派在軍部方面的代表人物、是陸相荒木貞夫、關東軍司令武藤信義、敎育總監林銳十郎、文人則有内田康哉、以至平治騏一郎諸人、後一派在軍人中比較有力的、要以前參謀次長眞崎甚三郎爲主體、而以朝鮮總督宇垣一成附之、文人中則有民政黨的一部分人、可是後一派的人、雖然有參謀部在手裏、但是陸軍行政和滿洲的軍隊實際指揮權力、却在急進派手中、</p>
<p>事實上在東三省境内、敦化到圖門江岸的鐵道已經成功、日軍在東北的運用、更增加了一重便利、於是他就進一步發揮他侵略的企圖、第一是增派兩個師團赴滿、丨丨旭川第七師團全部、京都第十六師團、廣島五師團·及名古屋三師團、抽調精銳、開赴東北、轉往山海關以西·長城以南、擾亂河北、幷指使劉桂堂諸人、從多倫擾察哈爾、同時他更借扣車之名、去壓迫中東路、幷說是要以武力從事、而且常時借口勦匪、向蘇聯國境放槍、甚至派些小部隊、越入蘇聯國境、當然這是試試蘇聯的眞實態度、經過幾次試騐之後、他確實曉得蘇聯决心繼續維持和平對外政策、於是他對於中東鐵道、就更進一步的不客氣、聲言將從事於國境封鎖、及至蘇聯聲明願和平出讓中東路時、他又表示不願收買、即使收買、也必須價値在八千萬日金以下、這就明白顯出他要用武力强占、有意挑釁的象徴、</p>
<p>可是眞崎宇垣一流人、總覺着這事不妥、以爲一味蠻橫、究竟容易發生意外、殊不知事實上却是與急進派以有利的解釋和有利的環境、所以到底愼重論站不住脚、眞崎甚三郎、祇是得到陞爲大將的空名、把「參謀次長」和「軍事參議官」兩個軍事要職、都被擠掉、而以荒木派相信的植田謙吉（侵滬時的金澤第九師團長）繼任眞崎、以便實行其擴大軍事計劃、</p>
<p>本來照穩健派的理想、是要顧到國際關係、不主張進擾平津、得便即與中國議和平條件、等滿洲局勢穩定了再進攻、急進者則以爲乘此國際糾紛正多·世界經濟恐慌還看不見底止的時候、他正可以爲所欲爲、决不怕列國從中生阻力、同時他們也不能出面生什麽異議、所以他（日本軍部）先使三位一體的軍事巨頭丨丨參謀本部·陸軍部·敎育總監部·丨丨都是爲清一色的荒木急進派、與關東軍司令部一致聯絡、則對華對蘇、都有便利、於是乎和平論愼重論最大限祇是空言、决不能影響到任何實際行動、所以推倒齋藤内閣的運動、由暗中醞釀而至於公開爭辯、但以軍部的支持、延長到現在、依然没有人敢發動、</p>
<p>他們對華北的計劃、一面用天津作根據、收買失意軍人相機暴動、一面推進其在灤州豐潤以迄密雲前線的軍隊、來壓迫平津、同時更威脅着山東山西、分散中國軍隊的集合力、以便施行他各個擊破的舊策略、發展對華北侵略的野心、（一九三三·五·十六日於東京）</p>

<p>此次華紗不振、慘遭减工、不知者每以生産過剩爲詞、然而此說殊與事實相反、吾國棉紗業供給國人尙嫌不足、何致生産過剩、試以英國爲比、查英國人口及我七分之一、而我國紡織業按全國錠數計算及其七分之一、以全國人口支配、不敷之數、達十分之九、故吾國紗業、有加工之必要、何來生産過剩之虞、</p>
<h3 id="c96">華紗不振原因 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>然而生産雖不過剩、則華紗不振、確係事實、考其原因、極爲複雜、茲舉諸端如下、（一）金融界集中銀錢不肯流通、或利率過高、不克負擔、多數紗廠、其生命權操諸錢莊之手、此其一、（二）東北被日侵佔、華紗市塲被奪三分之一、此亦爲一致命傷、若南通諸廠、有錠二十萬、佔全國錠數十分之一、其出品全恃東北爲銷路、被佔迄今、東北華紗市塲、被日人庖代矣、（三）申新紗廠、在棉業界之勢力、佔五分之一、以前暢銷雲南貴州　自内亂頻仍、雲貴匯水尤跌、雲貴銀幣七元、抵滬銀一元、因此申新棉紗、在雲貴兩省、無推銷可能、此則受内戰之賜也、（四）前年十六省大水災、民生凋敝、加以内戰、致民間購買力薄弱、（五）揚子江流域、日人以優貨削價傾銷、（六）日人享治外法權、自由在我内地購料、避免征稅、而華紗業購料、受苛稅雜捐、成本浩大、（七）華紗廠與日紗廠之相較、吾人但知有華商紗廠聯合會、殊不知各自爲政、痛癢毫不相關、貪圖零星交易、出品雜格、原料不統一、况華紗廠除紡粗紗可用土産原料外、其餘稍細之紗、須用美印原料、工資高、開支大、而出品不如日紗、反視日紗業採托拉斯政策、遇事一致行動、操縱市塲、採用之原料旣一致、出品亦一致、於是其工資及開支、較爲經濟、綜上七大原因、華紗不振、胥基於是、</p>
<h3 id="c97">根本解决方法 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>求振興華紗、可以二種方法、其（一）吾國人口有四萬八千萬之衆、除生産者外、其餘純粹消費者、約居六分之一、即有八千萬人、凡國家政府法令之所及者、若軍隊之服裝用品、公務人員、青年學生、一律强迫服用國貨　有　八千萬人維持華紗、華紗何患不振、（二）請華紗聯合會、於每件棉紗抽稅一兩、年可得三百萬、五年後有千五百萬、即以此資、設棉紗銀行、商辦官督、專以救濟華紗、如此逐年讓利、十年以後、非但可使華紗業　如磐石、即欲消滅外紗、亦綽有餘力也云云、</p>
<h3 id="c98">華商紗廠决繼續减工 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>市價稍有起色成本加重</p>
<p>外貨傾銷存貨尙未减少</p>
<p>華商紗廠、遵照全國華商紗廠聯合會决議案、自上月二十二日起、實行减工百分之二十三、星期六星期日兩天停開日夜班後、今日止爲減工一月期滿、曾經聯合會决議期滿後、由各紗廠斟酌自身情形决定辦法、新聲社記者、特往訪聯合會發言人、據談、期滿後各廠繼續減工否、聯合會未便過問、但在此受外貨傾銷影響之時、紡成之紗、勢必虧本、而存紗未見减少、政府對於救濟辦法、尙未實現、爲維持生存計、故恐難以恢復云云、</p>
<h3 id="c99">紗價狀况 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>

<p>本市華商紗廠、共計恒豐·申新·永安·溥益·緯通·統益·等二十八家、紗錠約一百十一萬七千枚、布機約七千八百臺、以積成紗布、未見减少、値此金融奇緊、利率高昻之時、實無力恢復原狀、曾經各廠分别召集會議决定、繼續減工辦法、仍爲减百分之二十三、星期六星期日停開日夜班、一俟存紗减少、市價起色、即行儘量設法恢復、惟談家渡之崇信紡織公司、維持原狀、因上次亦未减工、岳州路經緯朋記紡織廠、因係廢花廠、亦未减工、</p>
<h3 id="c101">實行緊縮 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>各華商紗廠爲維持生存計、除減工外、同時實行緊縮、以節省開支、如申新第六第五等廠、裁减各部工人、申新一廠、取消工人賞工、以致引起工人反對、紛呈市黨部社會局請求援助、黨政機關、前日已派員會查、以便進行調處、聞有少數紗廠、以减工後維持仍覺困難、擬將布機間夜班停開、改開常日班、每人工作布機二檯者、現改工作一檯、餘一檯爲夜班工人工作、</p>

<p>第三，就是團結，中國人比日本人多幾倍，爲什麽受日本人的侵略，數十年來不僅洗去一些舊的國恥，反而新的國恥一天一天地增加，這就是王雲五先生說的，我們中國人是一個人一國，第四也就是王雲五先生所說的大家要做，不要說空話，我們要立志去做，幷且要各人先把本位的事做好，才是眞做，我自己也要加倍的去做，因爲這是爲國難而努力，决不能與和平常一樣，諸位的職業當然各各不同，就只從本位去努力、譬如兄弟是在職業敎育社服務，從此對於我的本位的工作要加倍努力，平時做了八時就休息，而現在一直到將來，非特别多做不可，我現在又要說到王雲五先生，他是商務書館的總經理，在普通的人看來，總經理彷彿大將一般，本來是很快樂的，無論什麽事情，只要支配給别人去做，自已儘可偷閒舒服，何苦要去辛辛苦苦的操勞呢，但是王雲五先生却不對了，不是這樣，自從一二八之後，商務書館受了這樣的巨大損失，而到八月中僅相隔半年，就能够復興，究竟是什麽理由，原來就是王雲五先生在裏面，人家要休息，他却不休息，逢到星期例假，本該去尋一點娛藥，但是他也不去，甚至有人請他赴宴，以及種種集會，他都不去，受到種種痛苦，他都能不顧一切的忍受着，領導着同事辛苦經營，有志者事竟成，商務書館在半年便能復興起來，我們要如何的佩服王雲五先生的精神，因此我們明天起，大家都該學他，中國就能有希望，</p>
<p>可惜今天的聽衆都是老百姓，若是今天政府當局能有人在這裏，聽了王雲五先生的辦事奮鬥精神，如果他們幾位當局也肯這樣把國家大事負起責任來幹，復興中國眞不是什麽難事了，我所說的，都是一些老話，現在我來說幾句新話，因爲這個題目，已經許多先生講過了，兄弟今天來做一個結束，幷且我希望要大家裝在腦中而能實在的去做不要再說空話，</p>
<p>中國現在最重要的，是要改變人生態度，但是怎樣改法呢，應　先要認清，什麽是人，因爲現在人人只看見一個「我」，幷且只見「小我」而不見「大我」，就是人的觀念錯了，普通只知道手足肌肉皮膚是我自己的，這就是一個「小我」，應該這個不是我，許多人纔是我，中國全部更是我，還有肉體之外有心靈，要肉體與心靈合起來，纔是眞正的我，</p>
<p>諸位可曾見報紙上，就可以知道最近發生的一件事，在法租界有一個理髮匠，他在路旁招生意，一個巡警上去查他執照，而那個理髮匠見了巡警來查執照，嚇得逃避不遑，但是那個巡警就趕上去，一連踢了幾脚，就把他踢死了，如果這件事出在外國，就是很大的問題，不幸而出在中國，大家瞧熱鬧的多，出來援助的少，因此我在近幾年中，所受到的刺激，實在不少，從前我有一個朋友沈彭年君，坐了人力車在金神父路經過，被一輛運貨汽車撞了一下，當然把沈君從車上抛出丈餘，頓時跌死，可是大家想得到，金神父路是一條很熱鬧的馬路，當然看見肇事的人在少數，不過大家都是怕事，而袖手不問，那時適有一個西人經過，他乘的是機器脚踏車，看見那汽車闖了禍便逃，他因不服，故追上去抄了號碼，幷做見證，因此那沈君雖然死了，還能交涉一下，仍是沾了外人的光，這不是極痛心的一件事嗎，還有一件，去年我的兒子，在路上見一個巡警打人力車夫，他就上去抄他號頭，那個巡警見我的兒子在抄他號頭，就動手來打，我的兒子就責他，如果車夫違章，可以帶局，或照章處罰，何以如此打他，那巡警非但不爲所動，幷且把小兒帶局，恰巧旁邊有個女子，也不過一二十歲，她却很有膽量，悄悄跟去證明，結果那巡警受了處分，小兒與那女子都釋放了，兄弟那時就對小兒說，這樣做法是對的，許多袖手旁觀的，迺是認錯了人生觀，以爲自己的身體是我，被巡警打的是車夫，是江北人，於我無關，在口頭上儘高唱着同胞，實際上各不相關，但是同胞兩字，我們該知道是什麽意義，要曉得同胞者，是比喻母腹中生下同一胞胎，而在息息相關的意思，這明明視同一體的意思，不料現在大爱僅不過認爲一種口頭禪罷了，我想中國的人民，現在看到東北的同胞儘管水深火熱，在南方的儘可安閑自在，如果此次是日本被蘇聯進兵到北海道，恐怕全國都要振奮得發狂，决不會再像中國那樣仍舊爭權奪利内亂不止，以上所講的是人，現在要講到生，「生」，就是死的對象，要不怕死纔生够生，還有人說，「死中求生」，「死裏逃生」，這就是不怕死的意思，比彷目前大家在此聽演講，忽然有一個炸彈來了，但是掉在此地而還没有爆發，如果大家没有方法而且怕死，那末一亂之後，或者炸彈爆發了，大家還能活嗎，倘使有一個人不怕死，幷且願意自己死，來把這炸彈移去，那就數百人都能活了，倘使人人不肯死而要活的話，反而同歸於盡，我們知道去年的十九路軍，他們並不是傻子，因爲他們是想，我們去在廟行江灣等的地方死了，大家可以生存，所以我們現在的生存，是去年許多戰上的血換來的，我們可不能忘記啊，</p>
<p>我們現在，無論讀過書的或者研究社會學的，稍具常識的，都該知道，從前的軍隊，比彷拿着一面白旗在招兵，說一個月多少錢，大家都不肯去，是什麽意思，因爲這是哄騙式而無眞意義的，現在有人去投義勇軍，就是本來可以不死，但是爲國而死，民族可以生存，那是死得値得的，本來可以不去當兵，爲了民族奮鬥，能爭民族的生存，也是當兵當得値得的，</p>
<p>兄弟近來所受刺激太深，幷且自問在南方安居，眞是負疚於心，因此我希望大家認清「人生」，最後的一句話，無非要改變人生態度，而且從明天起，我自已也應當改變，方不愧爲國民的一份子，從此願與諸君共勉之，</p>

<h3 id="c169">天堂 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>閘北給皇軍打得落花流水，炸得烈熖騰空，租界庽公儘左擁嬌妻，右抱美妾，豋十八層大厦，鑒賞着上海有史以來未有的大火。這是去年淞滬戰中的一幕。</p>
<p>對，在上海，有「大英地界」，有「佛來西地界」，雖然閘北已成爲「無人之境」，租界上究竟日本兵也不敢來胡天胡帝地蠻幹。租界之所以吃香，就是這道理。</p>
<p>這幾天，平津有些不穩妥，「古物爲貴，富人次之，土地爲輕」，所以古物已席捲一空的運到了上海的「佛來西地界」，妥爲存放。古物運完之後，平津富人們，提妻挈妾，捆載細軟，搭火車的搭火車，搭海輪的搭海輪，紛紛南下。據報載，日來上海各旅館，生涯鼎盛，這就可證明上海的租界，眞是人間的「天堂」。</p>
<p>本來，在上海，已擠滿了避兵，避匪的内地大老官，再加上了民國十二餘年來的下台政客，失意軍人，租界雖把界越越越大，大厦雖已築得如各中樓閣，但是平津人若再大批來滬做庽公，「天堂」總也不免有人滿之患</p>
<p>華北的戰事，頗有南展的趨勢，尙還未被本國兵，匪壓迫到上海來的那些平津之外的華北紳富，在不久的將來，或許都要來加入這個「繁榮上海」的集團裏努力。到那時，糟糕，「天堂一要被擠破啦。</p>
<p>日本人早已在那裏替我們打算了。他們想「聯檔」着各國留滬僑民，把上海造成一個「永久和平」的「自由市」，把租界範圍，擴展到吳淞，江灣，眞茹，閘北。</p>
<p>妙啊，這一回事，一旦成爲事實，上海不將成爲「世界第一大天堂」了麽？哈哈，經之營之，不日成之，請弗找急，拭目俟之。</p>
<h3 id="c170">燈禍 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>這一回吾們嘉定雖小小一個縣地方，連續不斷的大出其燈，初起是四鄕，每夜鬧個不休，鑼鼓震天響的敲着，出城看燈的人好像潮湧一般，而做縣長做區長的也像充耳不聞，任他胡鬧罷了！有人說，去歲被日本兵佔據了兩個多月，好算曾做過亡縣奴，不過隔了一年，難道大家已忘記這個苦日麽？呸！這就呌「苦中作樂，」不識相的幾位學者先生，偏穿上西裝革履到鄕村裏去跑了一周，搦起筆來縐幾句「農村破産」「經濟没落」的大文，登載到報上替他們訴苦，眞是隔靴搔癢，豈知他們爲了興高采烈的出燈，化去血汗和泥塊中得來的金錢不少呢？</p>
<p>眼前婁塘鎭，也正在做這句當，聽得最先某區長要禁止，竟以本身的去就力爭不可，好！偏偏碰了高興出燈　諸公們的頂子，於是你到蘇州去辦行頭，你捐出兩大担蠟燭，和某區長去决一個雌雄，所以婁塘的花燈，可算是激出來的，其實出燈這件事，地方上究竟需要呢？還是應當禁止呢？這問題倘若提出來要解决，不是要好笑煞人麽？後來，果眞拿爲首的兩人，提到官裏去吃官司，不料這兩人背後有人包用的，你儘管關在看守所裏，要吃吾替你送進來，要用吾代你買進去，因爲這個，吃官司是吃官司，出燈的還是在外出燈，禁止兩字，在官廳方面講，　簡直早已宣告破産了。</p>
<p>但是在城市的一般與出燈的表示同意的人們，到此也有些技癢　難熬的樣子，說各鄕鎭旣可出燈，城裏因何必要禁止，於是亦遂演起燈來了，名呌「慶祝戰事勝利」豈知天有風雲，人有禍福，燈未曾出成，就演了一齣悲劇，幾個登塲人物，打得頭破血流，只好上崑山向閔家裏先生求救命，而且當時在縣府二門口，不曉得聚了許多人，與警察互鬭，眞像大鬧嘉興府的全武行，末了，明日竟形成罷市的狀態，不惜小題大做，差不多比以前對付外交失敗，要推倒曹陸章，還要有力，縣商會開緊急會議，提出最有效的抗告書六條，好一個徐維震縣長，態度從容，不會着急，没有一條不接受，恰巧西門外虹橋西，洽泰鷄蛋行來了四個强盜，刦去現洋四百餘元，時正傍晚八時，這會議尙還未罷，在座的聽得電話裏這個警報，不覺吃一個大驚，像也悟到城裏出燈纔不是一件太平事啊？</p>

<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>民國十七年，武漢正鬧分共時期，吳稚暉先生與汪精衛先生因政見之　偶有不同，曾大打其筆墨官司。</p>
<p>在許多精警而又　滑梯的大文之中，我還記得吳老先生以　前曾在唐山敎過書。並且還記得他曾對汪先生說過這麽幾句話：</p>
<p>「現在只有把兩頂軍帽放在你我的頭上，國事就有辦法。」</p>
<p>哦！因爲吳汪兩先生没有戴　上軍帽，國事所以没有辦法。據說唐山又已失守了。不，是全師撤退的。那末，大槪又是一種新計畫吧。是先生旣與唐山發生過關係，當不勝其故國河山之感。但不知他還能否記起那頂軍帽？</p>
<p>時到如今，凡是中國的人民，不論其爲昏庸老朽，或粗暴少年，一律要戴上軍帽的時期，丨如果中國還算得是一個國家的話丨大槪快要到了吧！我熱誠的懇求吳老先生首先戴上軍帽，爲天下倡！我們應當一致起來擁護吳先生的軍帽主義，國難才可得救。</p>

<p>這幾天忽然的大熱起來，雖然没有到六月，但氣溫已是很高，很可把冰淇淋荷蘭水當做解熱的飲料了。</p>
<p>從太陽當頂的馬路中回來，頭裏已有幾分暈沉，想要做些工作，那知身體　帳到床上，便做起好夢，入了睡鄕了。</p>
<p>兩小時以後，幾聲的霹靂，驚醒了我的好夢，起來一看，烏雲已滿佈在四周，知道要下大雨了，不久雨點如黄豆般飛來，這時立在窗口向馬路中望去，自有好多特殊的景象，可以當作寫文章的資料。</p>
<p>對過的樓窗裏一位嫂嫂，見了雨點，碰命的奔到陽臺上把曬在窗口的衣服，尿布，很怱急的搶到裏面去。</p>
<p>路上的行人，誰都在碰命的奔跑，但雨點是太大了，就是在雨點中跑兩三步路，衣服也會淋得濕透。</p>
<p>車夫在途中看見下雨，馬上替乘客撑起了布篷，但他們自己，又誰也不帶雨衣，祗是在雨點中狂奔，不怕冷雨的冲打</p>
<p>祇有汽車是最安穩，憑是雨點如何粗大，也打不進車窗，不會使車中人的衣服被雨點淋濕了絲毫。</p>
<p>一對青年男女，當他們挽手而同行之時，雨點突然的來打擊他們，快跑到那裏一家舖子裏去躱雨，但又怕錯過了看電影的時間，天眞惡作劇吧？</p>
<p>好多的女人，在窒小的屋子裏，委實熱得不能再住了，都拿了矮凳跑到弄堂裏去納凉，可是一陣暴雨，竟把　們一齊的趕回了家裏。</p>
<p>一聲震耳的霹靂，從天空中落下，祗嚇得隔壁的太太，又在張着口不停的念「阿彌陀佛」了，牠心理祗望黑心人的天打。</p>
<p>半小時的暴雨，在怱促中過去了，太陽依然在西面從烏雲中逃了出來，街市上除了路面加上一重雨水打濕的情狀之外，什麽都和剛才一樣，行人也恢復了暴雨前的熱鬧，天雖是依然很熱，但總究是消退了三分的熱氣。</p>

<p>第七回　數語絕恩情閉門痛哭一肩擔道義酌酒商談</p>
<p>桂枝說到這裏，嗓子硬着，什麽話也說不下去了。掉轉身軀，就向家裏走。到家以後，恰是母親不在家，他將房門一關，倒在坑上，兩手扶着一個大枕頭，哇的一聲，就哭將起來。自己也不明白是何緣故，傷心到了二十四分緊緊的摟住那個枕頭，只管哭個不歇。過了一會子，江民由後面院子回來了，在屋子外面，就聽到桂枝嗚嗚咽咽的哭聲，先就嚇了一跳，及至走到屋子裏來，那臥室門已是雙扉緊閉，推了兩下，那門也不見開。江氏想着，這可奇了，大正月裏的，我旣不曾說他什麽，别人也没有什麽事得罪了他，爲什麽這樣大哭起來呢，於是砰砰砰亂搥着門道：喂！開門啦，孩子，你怎麽了？桂枝哭的時候，只想一口氣哭了出來，洩出胸中的積忿，至於有什麽人來聽到没有，這一層，他却不曾加以考慮。這時兩扇房門搥着嚮，他才忽然想到，這樣大哭而特哭，母親豈不要追問一個原由，而今母親來了，這哭聲還是停止不停止呢？若是停止呢，哭可以隨便停止，哭得未免無理由。若是不停止呢，緊閉了兩扇大門，鬧得母親不知所云，倒要大吃一驚起來，他伏在坑上，一時想不出一個妥當的主意，却哭得更厲害了。江氏亂搥着門道：怎麽了？怎麽了？倒是打開門來，和我說個清楚明白呀。說時，又連連的搥了幾下門。因見門不能開，便道：你開門不開門，你不開門，我就要到後院把趙連長請來，搥開這大門了。桂枝聽到要把趙連長找來搥開大門，這可是與顔面有關的事情，先且不開門，在床上跳起來答應着道：你發了瘋了嗎？爲什麽把外人找了來？江氏道：你這孩子，倒眞是發了瘋了，開口，就駡人，連我也駡上了，桂枝也不再說什麽，跳了起來，卜通幾下，將房門開着，然後扭轉身又向坑上一躺，面朝了墻角，並不作聲，（七七）</p>

<p>我們天天所吃的白米，在煮的時候，大都經過幾回淘洗，可是頭號精米，倘若用手搓擦湖洗，那末煮熟的飯，不但食之無益，反有大害，爲什麽呢？我們把精米煮成的熟飯，用科學的方法，試騐他的營養價値，非常低劣，就是（一）白米飯已經失去維他命Ａ，Ｂ，（二）缺少了蛋白質，尤其對於維持生命上，必要的亞米諾酸，因爲經過淘汰，以致身體上受致命的打擊，（三）無機鹽類中的加里姆與燐，就此加多，鐵質，沃素等反被淘去了，所以我們吃了這種白米飯，不過祇有熱量，而身體上必要的營養素與正常的生活保持上必要的營養分，都不足了，况且缺少維他命Ｂ的時候，身體就要感到不舒服起來的，我們中國人，對於吃白米飯，一般没有知識的人，往往以爲吃頭號精米，是好的，米也愈淘愈爲清潔的，要知道精米本來已缺乏營養素，再加以拚命的搓擦淘洗，那末把所有的營養分，完全喪失了，這一點特請主婦們注意啊，現在我再把營養分損失的理由，詳細的說明一下：</p>
<p>（一）精米營養分的損失　從去殻的糙米，經過搗樁，而爲精白的米，損失成分，爲脂肪（七三·九％）粗纎維（六七·三％）灰分（四一·二％）又灰分中的燐酸，以搗精的時間爲比例，减少其成分，特因搗樁過久，把無機鹽類，蛋白質，維他命Ａ，完全喪失，現在衛生家提倡糙米運動，就是爲保持原有營養分的緣故。</p>
<p>（二）淘洗時營養分的損失　普通次等之白米，大槪保有維他命Ｂ，倘若經過淘洗搓擦，那末因水溶性的關係，維他命Ｂ也消滅了，其他又損失了粗纎維七六·四％，脂肪六一·六％，灰灰四一·八％，照這樣看起來，我們日常所吃的米飯，第一不可過於精白，第二不可多洗，而且洗的時候，切不可用手搓擦，輕輕的淘了一二次已妥，假使我們專吃頭號精米，煮飯時又把米經過五六次的淘洗，那是不到一二個月，就要發生脚氣病，同時面色也漸漸的變爲枯血黄萎了。</p>
<p>（二）試騐飲水</p>
<p>在水道完備的都會，所吃的水，固然没有危險，但在鄕村以及没有水道的地方，大槪都是汲自河川井戶，所以做主婦的人，應當明白水質的良惡，現在我把試騐水質成分的簡單方法，來介紹一下：</p>
<p>（一）硝酸銀試騐法　用玻璃杯盛滿飲水，加入硝酸銀液五六滴，就變成淡白色，這水就可以使用，若是白色變爲混濁而有沈澱時，那就是齷齪的水，必有屎尿混入在内的，這是水中含有鹽分的證明，但是與海岸相近的井戶溪流，水的成分，亦爲鹽性，雖没有屎尿流人，也要變爲混濁的，這一點，我們當然觀察周圍的狀况與水的平常性質可以判定的。</p>
<p>（二）有機物試騐法　用水半杯，加硫酸，過錳鉀酸加里溶液（○百分之○·一）二三滴，水即發熱，變爲紫赤色，若紫赤色没有消滅，證明水中没有什麽有機物，可以飲用的，倘若紫赤色立卽消滅，再加入上列的藥十二三滴試騐，仍舊如此，那末斷定其水，必含有多量的動植物性的腐敗物了。</p>
<p>（三）阿姆尼亞試騐法　用水半杯，加入耐士拉氏試騐液四五滴，水中如有阿姆尼亞，必因其量的多少，變爲淡黄色或赤褐色，倘若赤褐色中有沈澱的東西，那水更汚濁不堪了。</p>

<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第四章　業務之情形</p>
<p>第三節　雜醫僞藥</p>
<p>雜醫二字。在理不得成爲一個專門名詞。然而在目前上海之實况中間。却不幸有許多替人治病的人。旣不根據舊醫。又無新醫的眞知。不得已只好姑名之爲雜醫了。雜醫在某種社會裏。利用社會知識之淺薄。以及經濟的衰落。足以施展所謂江湖術，而使他們的業務甚爲發達。前五六年。早有推大車張布幔的傷科牙醫。兼打什麽德國獅牌九一四云云。但是現在已經落伍。因爲社會程度。也在一知半解的進步。所以目前的雜醫。却另在熱鬧去處。租起了相當房屋。裝上年紅電燈。陳設了沿馬路的花柳病標本小型展覧會，丨報上豋起了很大的廣告。充滿許多新舊醫的名詞。和慈善的口號，於是他他的業務。也就由最低級社會。漸次侵入到中上社會。而所取的代價。因爲中上社會的光顧。而逐步上漲。從騙飯吃。以至於想發財。也是人心必然的趨勢。但是藥品究竟是治病的工具。診療乃是醫家的學識。雜醫們可以在報上豋載什麽「奥倫每針一元」。「阿爾梯共每釘七角」。那麽馮存仁慶餘堂也何嘗不可大豋廣告。說「小川連每錢二角半」。「錦紋大黄每兩三角半」。而以爲解决社會經濟醫藥的口號了。這種胎笑世界的奇觀。非但不能引起社會人士之糾正。反爾有一部份十紳表着同情。中國的事。也就可想了。從前守舊時代。兵器只有戈矛之屬。可以家置人備。如今槍砲犀利。危險性大了。遂不許人民私藏軍火。然而將新的化學製品。流落在不學無術的手裏。恐怕救命不足。殺人有餘。而目新藥殺人。死無對證。法界冬烘。還墨守着洗寃錄的古本。（曾見某律師爲文大駁法醫之解剖而提倡洗寃錄。）卽使告狀。也告不出什麽名目來。政府當局。何以只知取締軍火。而不知取締藥物的使用呢。</p>
<p>曾有某次。我受一個朋友的責備。說新醫昌盛。西藥濫觴。造成如許怪象。你們要負相當責任來糾正的。於是我第一步便去責備西商。將藥品供給與雜醫的荒唐。然而那西商。却回復得好。他說你們貴國的「治病匠」。種類很多。不知那一種人該買我們的藥。那一種人不該買。至今没有明令規定。我們是法治國人民。凡是没有法律根據。恕不能代人受過。！我只得啞然而退。</p>
<p>藥界……與雜醫相對的名稱是僞藥。僞藥的策源地。可以算得上海。照報紙上看來。非但什麽「科學方法。」「悉心研究的製品。觸目皆是。就是内地的名山大川。各種仙草。也都運到上海來救人。出處不如聚處。也算上海居民天大的福分。這話又說回來了。草根樹皮。那一樣不可入藥。本無所謂眞僞。但是實效與廣告相去太遠。物質與學理大相背謬。卽是僞品。僞品的産生。可分爲二種。一種是没有成效統計的單方草頭。一種是藉詞歛錢的投機製品。前者爲禍還小。後者却就居心可惡了。自上年發見了「謬治肺癆的三那星」以及「非驢非馬的無量壽（說什麽電氣加入人參云云）以後。覺得三那星足以耽誤肺病的早期療法。無量壽則搖惑人心。搬弄學說。所以曾在社會醫報爲文痛闢其妄。然而結果。該兩公司還提起訴訟。告我損壞他的信譽。終於經過實在的藥物試騐和考據。證明他種種謬誤。而這件案子。漸歸於沉寂了。</p>
<h3 id="c195">聞永嘉余子維氏遺囑解剖屍體後感言 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 計濟霖</p>
<p>永嘉自前清間闢爲商埠。於茲已經六十餘年了。在這社會日趨進化的當兒。依着大自然和人爲的推動力。一切的現象丨政治。經濟。敎育等等。均有相當的進展。科學化的新醫事業。自然也不能例外。最近在朝氣勃勃的新醫界裏，破天荒産生了一件動人聽聞的事。這事的産生。影響到社會甚大。而於新醫界貢獻尤多。事實是這樣。</p>
<p>余子維氏爲留東醫界前輩丨杭州醫藥專校余德蓀敎授的封翁。氏於中西醫學。研究頗深。而尤精於解剖學。平素奬掖後進。不遺餘力。客歲病胃癌。自知不起。遺囑解剖其屍體。</p>
<p>死。本是人生最後的階段。誰也不能避免。如果依哲學的眼光來觀察。是一件很平凡的事。而且屍體解剖。在歐美各國。也早已「司空見慣」。但在這毫無目標的中國社會。尤其是永嘉。人民還没有確認科學醫眞價値的時候。余氏能以身作則。提倡解剖。所以會認爲有意義和値得贊揚的事。</p>
<p>解剖在我國古代已有人行之。攷之古書。尙書載着「刳剔孕婦」和「斮朝涉之脛。剖賢人之心」。漢書王莽傳載着「翟義黨王孫慶捕得。莽使大醫尙方與攷屠共刳剥之。量度五臧。以竹筵導其脈。知其所終」。但此爲一種好奇心的驅使。作偶然的觀察。毫無醫學的意義。至於以研究醫學而出之解剖者。黄帝時代。早已有之。内經靈樞篇所載之解剖學識。均由「解剖而視之」而來。可惜當時的解剖。根爲簡單。所以我國許多舊醫書都載着錯譌的解剖學識。即是後世尊爲醫聖的扁鵲所著的難經。也有所不免。例如難經上載「肺重三斤三兩。六葉兩耳。凡八葉」。「心重十二兩。中有七孔三毛。盛精汗三合」等等。完全由推想而得。不過此不足爲古人病。因爲千數百年以前。科學還没有發達。當然不能如今日的精確。只恨後世醫者。没有繼續研究剖騐。古書的錯譌。依然奉爲金科玉律。不起來更正。甚至變本加厲。臆說附會。致令這種錯譌的解剖學識。流傳民間。這次余氏屍體解剖時。曾分别函知各法團代表和民衆。公開參觀。根本糾正民間錯譌解剖的觀念。醫學　科學之一。他的基礎建築在解剖學上。所以民衆對解剖有正確的認識。便是認識科學的醫學的嚆矢。</p>
<p>世界以醫學著名的國家。解剖都異常注重。如德國柏林大學解剖研究院。在西曆一千七百十三年。已經創立。實習室中列屍數百具。以供學生研究之用。我國自改革以還。新醫事業。雖也現着蒸蒸日上的氣象。但對於解剖仍不多見。醫學校除國立公立者得着政府援助。可從監獄提取病囚或死囚以　解剖外。至於私立醫校。祇有狂走於流村野墳間。尋取暴露之骨髏。以爲實習的材料而已。我國屍體解剖不多的原因。不是缺乏有經騐病理解剖的專家。而在於民間的反對。民衆因受着「身體髮膚。受之父母。不敢毁傷」的古訓影響。以爲人死而任其剖腹斷肢。是名敎極大的罪人。爲人類所不齒。記得十餘年前報載某醫師（忘其姓氏）解剖其叔之屍體。竟引起社會的攻擊。涉訟法庭。足徴國人對於屍體的重視。這次余氏屍體解剖。破除民衆陳腐的心理。使他們明瞭解剖的眞義。意義是何等的重大。</p>
<p>凡是人類。對於醫者。總希望他有精確的診斷。因爲疾病的結果如何。與診斷有密切的關係。所以學騐兩富的醫者。最要在鑑别疾病的種類。觀察病情的變化。而下一精確的診斷之後。纔定出適當的合理的療法。不幸遇到不易診斷而片時即死的危症。甲醫斷爲甲病。乙醫斷爲乙病。聚訟紛紜。莫衷一是的時候。非靠着屍體解剖。不能知道病在何處。究爲何病。譬如余氏所患係胃癌。經了解剖之後。更覺新醫診斷的精確。使民衆認識新醫的眞面目。余氏眞死有餘功了。</p>
<p>自忘淺鄙的我。說了上面一些話。也許能引起國人的注意。一致起來提倡屍體解剖。我更希望新醫界的同仁。與余氏抱着同一的志願。以身作則。使新醫早日普及到老大的中國。余氏有知。當亦含笑地下了。</p>
<h3 id="c196">最近的預防醫學 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 吟閣</p>
<p>預防醫學與衛生學的區别　預防醫學和衛生學似屬相同。實則爲兩種相異之學問。衛生乃敎個人或團體避免疾病或死亡的方法。預防醫學是指一切有直接保持健康之可能的方法而言。例如欲避傷寒症而避去汚水及不良食物。以及避去使身體衰弱之事。這是屬於衛生。至於注射傷寒症的菌苗。那是屬於預防醫學的範圍。</p>
<p>衛生一事吾人類自古即能注意。如對於飲食物在宗敎上有許多戒律。實即爲衛生方法。且不特人類有衛生。即吾人周圍所見的家畜和庭園的植物。亦未嘗不有衛生。如牛馬能分别有害的草。不加嚙食。草木生長的方向。有避光線的。有避黑暗的。有嫌濕氣的。有遠乾燥的。這都是　們衛生的規約。故個人衛生非人類所獨有。反之預防醫學實惟人類有之。動物並無因預防疾病或身體衰弱。而有一種積極的行爲。故預防醫學實爲號稱「萬物之靈」的人類所特有之現象。亦爲文化進步的徴騐。</p>
<p>預防醫學者的業蹟　　預防醫學在古代亦有見端。如原始的土人應用解毒劑。避毒矢的危險。或使毒力減弱。土人又漸次增量吸收毒物。以避砒素的毒害。增身體的抵抗。這都可認爲一種預防醫學的方法。</p>
<p>齊恩那　至近代始有天然痘的預防接種。英國的齊恩那因經騐而發見此方法。至一七九八年齊氏乃由實騐而見之實用。此大發見實爲預防醫學第一頁光榮的歷史。當時人尙不能了解種痘的理由和其實益。至百年以後始爲世人所周知。其後法國的巴斯德汲齊氏之流。更有所發見。巴斯德於預防醫學第一發見狂犬病的預防接種。此發見在一八八五年巴斯德氏與與倍倫氏及羅氏協力而成。其方法亦極有效。與種痘同。至今沿用。無所變更。罹病者皆受其賜。</p>
<p>以上二者實爲預防醫學的好例。近年預防醫學的發展。皆以衛生學細菌爲基礎。對於傳染病的預防。益見成功。</p>
<p>賴門　　在二三年對於白喉的預防注射。又能完成。據一般人所知小兒自生後滿一歲至六歲。易罹此病。此病的治療。以血清療法爲最有效。這是在四十年前倍林與北里氏所發明的。然至近年法國之巴斯德研究所血清部長賴門博士在歐戰時努力於血清製造。偶於試騐管中注意一可珍的現象。及戰事終了。　理頭研究。至一九二二年以毒素與抗毒素的相互作用爲基礎。發見一新現象。不久就把這新現象做基礎。而發見白喉的完全免　法。他所發明的方法是把新濾過極有强力的白喉毒素一立脫。加入四西西的福買林。置入三十八度的孵竈器</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>中一個月。最初强力的毒素變成無害於人體的物質。且可使完全免疫。因爲産生特異的抗毒素的緣故。此種物質氏名之爲白喉免疫素。取其極少量。每一二週間爲三次或二次的皮下注射。可使吾人對於實扶的里完全免疫。其免疫力約在五年間爲有效。如此方法可使幼兒完全免去白喉病菌的威脅。罹病率的减少。甚爲顯著。現在各國急於實施。意大利對於此事。竟發出敕令。凡白喉流行的地方。一歲至五歲的小兒。一律用此劑打針。（未完）</p>

<p>逕復者。紹衡前因事赴平。昨始返滬。大示敬悉。所論姙娠持續日期。東西自古俱有神話。然揆諸今日科學的産科。不免見笑大方。惟是根據莫如事實。往往世謂必無。而容或有之。前亦未始不可在産科學上創一新紀錄。按此事在民法上出入甚鉅。故歐美各國。大都均有明文規定。獨我國猶付缺如。誠爲憾事。拙著「産科學講義」所列各國規定。悉根據民國十七年前之民法。其後有無變更。未暇考實。所以姙娠持續日期。亦皆遵從醫學先進各國名著之記載。非敢有所肊造武斷也。貴友某君之夫人。兩子姙娠持續日期。均因超越常度。發生疑問。鄙意是頗有研究價値。惟紹衡所知Ｚongemeister氏所謂最例外。亦不過三百五十五日。然因其未普見於各書。故未採入。此外旣無紀實可據。又乏經見前例。更不敢輕舉欺世。隨意網羅。來示以姙娠時間。亦有例外延長至十五六個月者。紹衡淺學寡聞。願承敎益。可否惠示書名。俾益增識見。無任感荷。專此肅復。</p>

<p>紹衡大醫師。頃在友人家。得讀先生大著産科學講義。（十七年版）欣佩莫名。其中姙娠時間一節。仍未解决吾之疑問。特提出請敎高明。尙祈費神一答。吾友某君。謂其妻甚賢。結褵已八年。育二子。（姙娠期中。時有月經云。）第一子係某君離家十五個月後生。第二子係離家十二個月後生。考之姙娠規定時日。其妻必不貞明甚。惟再查他書。姙娠時間亦有例外延長至十五六個月者。貴著並無此說。且云照英國規定。最長亦只三百二十日。（數與原書不符紹衡註）到底姙娠時期有無例外延長。尙祈見覆爲荷。又我國民法。近來曾否規定　間。亦請便示及。專此順頌診安。</p>

<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>（十）（四）産後出血的處置</p>
<p>（甲）正常出血和異常出血</p>
<p>正常的出血。是在分娩前後各一次。第一次是在臨盆急迫的當兒。排泄粘液之中。混有稀薄的血液。第二次是在後産的娩出。因胎盤的剥離。稍有較多量的出血。此種出血。在胎盤及卵膜完全剥離後。因血管斷裂口被子宮收縮力所封鎖。就能自然停止。否則。子宮收縮如果不良。而斷裂口未能完全閉鎖。就要源源而來。出血不止。以致生命危險。</p>
<p>總之。一個産婦在正軌分娩的出血量。各人雖不一樣。但至少二百克至多六百克。如果超過這個數量。那就是異常的出血。</p>
<p>（乙）異常出血的來由</p>
<p>前置胎盤的主要症候。就是出血。前置胎盤有邊緣性側方性中央性的分别。因前置胎盤而出血。大抵並無外力的誘因。就能突然發生。發生的時期。可依胎盤附着的位置而判别。邊緣性出血最遲。大抵在妊娠第十個月的起初，其次是側方性。出血較早。大約在妊娠第九個月之中。中央性出血最早。大都在妊娠第七個月已經發生。</p>
<p>前置胎盤的出血。有多有少。數量不同。或有初發就是多量。或者初少後多。終至貧血。甚至或死亡。</p>
<p>異常出血·又爲胎盤早期剥離的主徴。胎盤何以早期剥離？大抵由於産婦患有子宮内膜炎。或妊娠性腎炎·身體劇烈運動。腹部受有打撲。卵膜堅靭。卵膜不易破裂等原因。以致内外出血。内出之血。潴留於子宮壁與剥離之胎盤及卵膜之間。在外並不見其出血。若血液流出外部。而症狀與内出血無異。這里外出血。内外出血發生後。下膜突然劇痛。子宮增大。且甚緊張。陣痛停止。脈搏頻數。而微弱。呼吸困難。四肢冷厥。神智不清。顔面蒼白。冷汗勃發。眼花耳鳴。甚或陷於急性貧血而亡。</p>
<p>（丙）異常出血的處置</p>
<p>異常出血發現後。應速請醫施術治療。但爲應急起見。可以先在下腹部。置上冰袋。並將患婦的臥勢，頭低下肢高。出血的傷口。最易遭受黴菌的侵入。未經醫師縫合之前。尤須注意清潔。</p>
<p>前置胎盤出血較微。靜臥已定。出血劇烈。應施陰道强洤塞。人工破丸。足位迴轉。子宮擴大等術。胎盤早期剥離有高度出血時。應排除子宮内容物爲</p>
<p>不二上策。於必要時。應行陰道擴大。陰道强拴塞。卵膜穿刺。以及鉗子穿顱截胎等術之一種。陰道發生血腫。可用百分一之來沙芳Ｌysofrm浸濕布壓抵。如已破裂。就用壓迫綳帶·</p>

<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>日光療法者。係利用太陽光線增進人體健康或治療疾病之方法也。其效果。大部分在於日光中所含之紫外線。故日光療法。須在有充分紫外線之日光下行之。方爲合法。但自太陽光中射出之紫外線。易爲空中之煤烟。塵埃。水蒸氣。等將其一部分吸收。同時亦可爲空氣吸收。故以遠離城市。在空氣稀薄之高地。行日光浴。最爲有效。然在平地。苟有日光直射之處。無論何處行日光浴。皆必有相當效果。</p>
<p>效果</p>
<p>日光浴對於一切虛弱體質。一切慢性病症。皆有效果。對於慢性經過之結核性病。例如肺結核。肋膜。腹膜之結核。腎臟。膀胱。生殖器之結核。骨關節之結核。皮膚之結核等。尤有卓效。</p>
<p>一般對於結核性之病。係採用安靜療法。如對於肺結核。則使之安臥。對於關節結核。則用石膏繃帶等。將患部固定。使之能得充分安靜。欲以人體先天所有之抵抗力。以抵抗病原及寄生蟲。又欲以人體自然反應發生之免疫力。以待病體之恢復。而</p>
<p>日光療法爲更進取之方法。使日光直射於全身之皮膚及患部（有傷處時）與人體以一種刺戟。增高其抵抗力。並促進免疫性之發生。性體質過於虛弱。行日光浴時。恐有危險。應受醫生之指導行之。</p>
<p>方法</p>
<p>日光療法。「第一」須利用日光之全部光線若在玻璃棚之中。紥外線爲玻璃所吸收。殊無效果。必須於日光直射之下。裹體行之。「第二」日光療法須爲漸進的。不可操之過急。方免失敗。第一日祗晒足部（自足踵至足尖）晒五分間。第二日晒下腿（自膝至足踵）五分間。晒足十分間。第三日晒上腿五分間。晒下腿十分間。晒足十五分間。如此將受日光直射部分。依此擴大。並將時間逐日增加。以及於全身。「第三」日光浴須直接　觸日光。着衣向日。不能謂爲日光浴。行日光浴後精神極爲爽快。恰如運動後所得快感。如食慾增加。能熟睡。增進抵抗力。患處亦有易於治愈之傾向。效力實匪淺鮮也。</p>

<p>— 郭達夫</p>
<p>著書者與敎書者，所走的，雖然都是關於書的一條路，但這兩種職業，却是絕對相尅的事實，是一般没有身歷其境的人所不能瞭解的。大家總只以爲敎敎書，就可以把敎材來出一本書。著書的人，於未完成他的書之先，就可以拿了他所收集的材料去敎敎。這兩件事件，是一而二，二而一，最容易簡單也没有的事，殊不知其中的甘苦，却有遠超出乎尋常人所能猜度的範圍之外者。</p>
<p>先來說著書與敎書的目的。兩者的主要目的當然是一樣，都在傳播智識，創造文化。其次，副目的當然也是什麽人都所不能免的一件事情，就是在吃飯。不錯，著書者與敎書者的目的，完全是一樣的。不過世人若祇因目的的相同，而即認這兩件事情爲合一體，那就不對了，因爲爲達到這目的之故，而經過的過程，有大不相同的地方在那裏。</p>
<p>第一，兩者的羣衆，或者說聽講者ＴheＡudience與讀者ＴheＲeadingＰublic之間，就有大大的差别。著作家的讀者羣，是没有時地，年齡，智識，階級，職業等的限制的，而敎書先生的聽衆，則大抵都須受着上舉的各種制限。還有著作者的讀者羣，是不大會與著作者見面的，而敎書先生的聽衆，却是面對面的活着躍動着的人。單就這一點上來說，我們就可以感到，著作者是何等的自由，而敎書者又須受幾多的束縛！所以有許多學問很好的人，一立上講臺，往往會說不出話來：而有許多辯才雄健的人，就是没有眞學問，也會說得頭頭是道，使聽者傾心。</p>
<p>第二，是著作者與敎書者的心理的變化：著作者，因爲享受着上面所說的許多自由，所以他的全部心靈，可以專注在著作的一點上。不嫌精細，不怕深沈，推敲磨練，到自己覺得滿意的時候，方將他的著作拿出去問世。而敎書者，因對方坐在那裏恭聽的，是名爲人的感情動物，所以因時因地都不得不受着聽衆的感情的支配。感情一動，思路就要散亂，先且不必說講者自己的情感氣分，就是單以聽衆的情感反映到講者的心裏去之後的那一種反應作用來說，敎書先生就不容易有十足的把握了，更何况現代的青年或大衆，都是富有着叛逆心理的生物呢！</p>
<p>第三，是理智與情感的衝突。從事於創造文學ＣreativeＬiterature或者說創作的人，是絕對不宜於敎書的；因爲創作者須以情感爲根底，而敎書者所獨重的是理智。理智的伸展培養，往往可以把情感殺死，而情感的熱浪高潮，也容易把理智攪亂。所以一位大詩人，而請他來敎詩的時候，也許會變成一個最壞的詩學敎授。詩人的朗讀，有時候還遠不及三等優伶的演習Ｒehearsal的說白。但中國却有一個惡習，每喜歡請那些創作者去敎書或講演，這纔是有百害而無一利的勾當。聽衆一時失了望，致生出後悔被騙的心來，例還事小，若創作家因受了一時的牽掣，而永久失去了他的靈感與詩情，那纔是民族的一大損失呢！　一九三三，五月二十日，</p>

<p>北海公園的柔綠色，在一點溫馨的和風中，向一切枝枒間散佈開了。波上搖盪着來往的船，陳的和新萌的水草，水鸛與野鴨們。</p>
<p>我時常因爲找一點「幽靜」，一人向那僻塞的一角去找座落。在園的北頭，有連着的三個玻璃亭，臨着水，背着一帶土巖，在雜亂的遊人中却能找出那不被湮没的自然來。</p>
<p>下午，在公園裏，一如商塲的上市。在上午來到公園，那一定是人世剩下來孤僻的人，或爲尋些排遣而來的。在上市時的遊覧，似乎具有一種其他作用了。人們似乎都這樣想着。</p>
<p>坐在那玻璃亭裏丨靠東向的一個丨已是半個時晨了；龍井不是眞的，却淡得可以，只好用强烈的烟來刺激。生在都會裏，過着强烈的刺激生活的人們，對於淡得和水似的事是渴慕着，等到一嘗試，却又感到一些缺憾。視線向空隙處散開，然而不久又被腦中所呼喚出來的問題收束住了。只是氣息新鮮，於肺部覺得爽適。</p>
<p>「喂，快着！添上三座。」</p>
<p>這忽促的聲音，使我回頭去，望在後背的一個座客丨年青而顯着老態，在不稱的身體上，極力飾着華麗丨那有所激動的臉上。他的伴，和他相同似的人，待着什麽的佇立着。</p>
<p>他們的來客是兩個女的和一個約十六七歲的長袍少年。異常拘謹的，向主方鞠躬着。伊們都修長，肥滿，而部的表情沈滯。自然，已在「青春的橋」的盡頭了，失去的歡樂已在那蒼白的顔面上留着悲哀的影子了。</p>
<p>繞着茶桌坐下來，似乎誰都知道誰，各人正度着各人的這一刹那引起來的情感，於是謙虛，客套來了，而所起首的話，無非是一些讚慕，出乎一種不一定要誠意的態度下。</p>
<p>「Ｒ女士…您，您在Ｎ大學的英文，誰不知道是坐了頭一把交椅的……」</p>
<p>主人，那着綠呢的青年致辭。</p>
<p>没有什麽，誠意的反響；那較高一點的，只是遜笑著。</p>
<p>「客氣，客氣。」</p>
<p>謙虛，自然是表現一種地位和「格」的，而在大庭廣衆的前面，是談着不欲談的事，笑着不願笑的笑。正因爲在男女之間，旁人的眼光是犀利而刻薄的。</p>
<p>着綠呢的青年又把話挽回了。</p>
<p>「您認識密斯忒宋嗎？Ｒ女士……」</p>
<p>「也許，記不清了。」</p>
<p>發言者舉起茶杯來，看着他的夥伴。或者是過於小心謹愼的結果，覺得對方散漫的口氣是含有用意的。便由困惑丨一點點困惑而求得扶正似的。</p>
<p>和兩女士同來的少年是安靜的，眼看在窗外，一個不管閒事的監督人似的，始終不啟口。</p>
<p>「他就是佟有信，華中中學的敎務主任。」</p>
<p>「啊！」那女的說，「好像不很認識。」</p>
<p>主人的伴，那著麻呢的青年，似乎因爲面貌過於黑黝了，只是低着頭假笑着。似乎有一種奇怪得使人憎惡的情感壓在他的喉間。</p>
<p>「有信，他也很知道女士的英文程度很高很高的。時常對人致着欣佩！」</p>
<p>主人仍這般無謂的說着。</p>
<p>女的是照例客套。她的同伴，彷彿姊妹似的，却含着諷嘲的笑，當眼不時朝着那麻呢服的青年時。</p>
<p>「我覺得同時，對於佟……也很帶著一種感想的……他以爲……因與學校方面正需要敎才，所以曾對我致意……」</p>
<p>「呵，是，」女的說。</p>
<p>「他看Ｒ女士能到那裏兼一點課不？」</p>
<p>女的話有些挽回了，道：</p>
<p>「不客氣，這實在是太客氣。」</p>
<p>旁座的人們都感着不自在。他們喁喁的議論着；他們很深刻的注意到他們談話問心理的變想，……</p>
<p>「敎課自然不是客氣，……」</p>
<p>主人這麽說。</p>
<p>那年紀較幼的女的，和同來的少年講了一些土腔。那少年立時起身了，向主人致着意丨要走。似乎不管留與不留，一杯茶，幾句客套，已經是很薄的人情……，便離了座，回絕了一切談話的引誘。</p>
<p>他們向兩青年深深的行著禮，而且兩眼朝直，回頭來，有風格的丨這自然是數十年來敎育的結果丨或者有風韻的走了。</p>
<p>座衆不滿意，也不高興，因爲他們預感着這兩青年的要落選。旣不美，又拘束，談一些文明事何用？</p>
<p>兩青年對於掩飾的功夫却是高强的丨自然，慣於掩飾的人是得不着異境的丨這麽說：</p>
<p>「早知道她們不敎課，何必請？」</p>
<p>「我也想過。」</p>
<p>「我想還是找李任武去。」</p>
<p>「自然。」</p>

<p>— 宜盦</p>
<p>一　外銷的慘落</p>
<p>中國不但是産茶的祖國，在幾十年前，凡是世界所飲用的茶葉，全是由中國所供給；在中國的對外貿易品中，茶葉的輸出額，最多時占總數的百分之五十以上。湘鄂皖贛閩浙各省的窮鄕僻壤間，也無不仰仗幾十萬或幾百萬的茶産收入，藉以活動其農村間的金融。</p>
<p>自從印度錫蘭及爪哇的紅茶先後發展以後，中國的紅茶出口，逐年减年，由最大數字的一百六十六萬餘擔（一八八○年）一降而到了十餘萬擔。湘鄂贛三省以及浙江的溫州紅茶，在國内外市塲，幾乎已無立脚的餘地，除掉安徽的祁門及其鄰近的紅茶，因品質上尙有相當的特點，可以勉强的點綴以外。</p>
<p>綠茶，一則因各國的需要不過占紅茶的八分之一，對外銷路，本來不如紅茶之多，一方面又受日本茶的競爭，美國銷路已逐年低减，非洲銷路，亦漸受危險。最近幾年來，爲安徽婺源，歙縣，休寗各地所産的上等珍眉綠茶，浙江紹興，上虞，新嵊，所産的平水茶，也都在阢隉不安的狀態之中了！</p>
<p>福建所産的烏龍茶，本來也爲輸出茶的重要産品之一，現在也受台灣茶的競爭，不但數量低减，甚至將絕跡於海外的市塲！</p>
<p>二　最大的弱點</p>
<p>茶葉的祖國雖然是中國，但這正像中國是老大的民族一樣。栽培製造的技術不如人，販賣宣傳和推廣的方法不如人，無論天然的品質如何優良，不能不受斵傷，不能不被人所淘汰。</p>
<p>中國的茶業，爲什麽斵傷得怎樣利害呢？這是關心於茶業的人，或者領悟中國的政治，經濟，社會以及文化方面的人，都能够詳細的舉出理由來，本來無待這裏再來叙述。現在約略舉幾件比較根本的問題罷。</p>
<p>（一）茶樹的衰老　中國的茶樹栽培，大都屬於農家的副業，宅旁山邊，隨便地繁殖着，近代栽培術中的施肥剪枝方法，固然缺而不備，就是必需的除草耕耘，也得看茶價的高低，而定取捨。在以前出口旺盛，獲利較多的當時，不但能注意除草耕耘的工作，而且新種茶地，也能不時的擴充或補植。現在則除春際隨意摘採點嫰老葉子，留存自用或因規定必須送敬地主以外，可售則售，否則，就不再會十分注意這無利可圖的事業了。於是百餘年或數十年來殘存的茶株，必然地逐漸的老衰。樹勢越衰老，茶質越硬化，品質也就越低劣了。這一點不但爲普通的茶商所不重視，就是一般談茶業問題者，也多半未能予以注意。舉例說罷。四川茶的不及兩湖，兩湖茶的次於寗州，而寗州的又不及祁門，便是顯例，因爲路川是中國茶業的發祥地，從長江上流而下，逐漸發展，而祁門的開闢。則還在最近三五十年來的事，</p>
<p>（二）製造拙劣　中國茶葉的製造方法最多，從有茶葉歷史以來，關於製造的方法也不能說不講究約遠在一千一百四五十年前，唐朝陸羽所著的茶經，關於飲用的方法已記載的很詳盡，但比之近代，印度日本各地的機械化和科學化，自然相形見絀了！簡單的說罷，綠茶的惟一條件要有清香的色味，紅茶重要的標準，是在顔色鮮濃，茶味雋永；前者在水色澄明，後者須醋酵整潔，而用科學的製造方法，財並不複雜，就是每種新鮮茶葉中所含有的兩種色素葉綠素和葉黄素以及對酸代酵素的如何利用。製造綠茶時用高溫將會變紅色的葉黄素和融化酵素停止作用，不但綠茶葉子的顔色澄明，味香增加，而且可以永遠不再變色。製造紅茶時則適得其反，要以適當的溫度使酸化，酵素漸漸地自然變化，直到原來綠的葉子，變成鮮紅色澤是這樣的科學化，味香乃至於形態亦復如是。中國紅綠茶的水色不能澄明，味香不甚雋永，就在製造方法上，不能儘量利用之故。於是出口綠茶的十分之七以上，都須用人工着了各種顔色以欺人，紅茶醋酵，祇是利用日光而不能在室内調節溫度，致受自然的支配，不能與印度錫蘭茶相競爭！</p>
<p>（三）名額過多　國人及國内茶商，嘗以我國茶葉産地的廣闊與品類的衆多跨耀於世界。當然，這是誰都不能和我們匹敵的，但也正因如此，於是各地有不同的製法；不同的形狀色澤；不同的口味香氣；於是産生各種不同的名稱。或以地名，或以時名，或以形名，或以物名，如一加統計，無慮幾千百種。專就輸出的茶葉說：雖然總　名稱不過二十種左右，而同一種類，其粗細高次又大有差别。這樣，不但對外宣傳極感困難，卽國外商人，也不能以統一的名稱，統一的價格，作統制的販賣。印度的離秘頓（Ｌlpton）茶葉，祇有黄牌，紅牌，桃紅牌的三等茶葉，和三種價格，當然利於宣傳利於販賣了。</p>
<p>（四）剥削過重　中國人民受了幾千年的封建努力的剥削，尤其是農村方面，所受的剥削之重，無待詳述。在以前，茶葉貿易隆盛時代，受了重重的剥削，倒還不要緊。現在成本日高，茶價日跌，地方稅捐，商人扣尅，外商壟斷，較前更甚。被稱爲中國紅茶之王的祁門茶，這幾天新茶市價雖較往年低减，但也出到二百元一担，可是内地茶農出售於茶行的價格，用二十二兩大秤，不過五角一斤，雖然過於潮濕，乾燥後非兩斤做一斤不可，但至多祗得到原價的一半而已。這半數中，雖然還得加上裝製運送等等的費用，大部分都是耗費在重重的剥削關係中。所以從民國八年以來，雖然出口稅總是免除，而茶葉外銷的不振，依然如故丨這意思不是贊成政府的恢復出口稅，不過藉此說明其他的剥削關係太嚴重，祇是免除出口稅，於事實没有較大的影響。</p>
<p>（五）缺乏組織　栽培製造方法的不良自然不易和各國去競爭，名類過多，剥削過重，對於宣傳及成本方面，當然也是最大缺點，但中國茶業的所以不能改良，缺乏相當的組織，也是重大的原因之一。雖然像内地的製茶商，尤其是上海漢口的介紹棧，有嚴密的組織、但這祗是保護商人自己的集團，雖然也有熱心的人，但祗是極少數而已。試看印度錫蘭的茶業改進委員會，有研究改良推銷宣傳等各種的組織，祗就去年六月間錫蘭所組織的廣告宣傳局，（ＴheＣeylonＭcaＰropagandaＢoard）從茶葉附加稅中所收入的費用，每年就達二百五十萬元以上。日本的茶業組合，郡縣及中央，都有切實的聯合，對内對外，系統分明，每年耗於茶業方面的費用，也在百萬元左右，這都是我們所望塵莫及的。别的缺點，當然是指不勝屈，現在進而討論改進華茶的幾條路綫。</p>
<p>三　復興的辦法</p>
<p>要改良生産的技術，要免除剥削的關係，這本來不是件難事。雖然技術的改良，照理自須經過相當的研究時期；但以茶業方面而論，一則不必要像稻麥等的農作物，先須經過品種方面的改良，動輒費時數年，祗須選擇場地，一面從事栽培，一面積極製造，便行了。其二像印度的製造紅茶，日本的製造綠茶，已舉有相當的成效，據今年在各地試騐的結果，可以說已成功了十之七八，照樣仿行，卽可達到目的。至於剥削這一點，祗須政治略上軌道，一紙命令，幾條法律，於最短時期内，也就可以收到了相當的功效。所以復興中國茶業，現在已不是如何改良生産，和免除剥削關係的問題；而是用什麽方法去進行的問題；簡單的說說，就是我們該怎樣的「幹」！</p>
<p>我們幹的方式，大致是不出這三種；</p>
<p>第一是資本主義的方式。這是仿照英國人在印度錫蘭所做的辦法。選擇宜茶之地，用大量的機械，大量的植茶面積，生産可以對外推廣的必要的數量，由數萬担而數十萬担而數百萬担，倘使進行順利，十年小成，二十年便可大成。但是現在世界的資本主義已走近末路，無論中國有否偌大的資本力，也不必說中國的茶葉生産方法爲小農的副業式，而且帶有季節性，每年至多祗能生産三四次，不像熱帶地方的印度錫蘭，可以終年採摘，終年製造；更不必論他們已有數十年根深蒂固的勢力，後起的弱小的資本主義，决難與其競爭。所以這一條，用資本主義方式的路，是不容易走得通。</p>
<p>第二是合作式，也可以說是日本現在所走的路。我們在最短的時期以内，釐定茶業合作法規，通令産茶的各省縣，無論爲栽培者或製造者，都使他們加入合作社，以新式的方法，貸予現欵，使之共同生産，共同製造，共同販賣；還有合作的聯合會，準備爲共同的直接輸出。這當然是一個最理想最妥當的方法。不過牠的缺點，就是迂緩。尤其在中國，地位旣大，人才又少，農民又急切難以合作，不免是扶得東來西又倒，何况農村已頻破産，茶業又是這樣的衰頽，怎能使我們耐着心兒，再慢慢地來改良呢？所以這一條路綫是可走而也不是一時走得通！</p>
<p>第三國營式也就是統制的方式。現在要復興中國的農村，必須利用革命的方式。村農如是，茶業亦然。這所謂國營的方式，應該用中央及各省政府和人民的力量，來合同經營，選擇各省宜茶的所在，釐訂茶區，用最新的科學方法，派遣專門人員，分别栽製。凡關於栽培製造販賣各項，都由國家計劃進行。預定爲六個産茶省：（一）湖南區擇安化桃源平江湘潭各縣，年産紅茶十萬担；（二）湖北區，擇蒲圻崇陽各縣，産紅茶十萬担：（三）江西區，擇舊屬寗州附近，産紅茶十萬担；（四）安徽區，在祁門至德（即秋浦）及江西的浮梁，産紅茶十萬担，婺源·歙縣·休寗等地，産珍眉十萬担；（五）浙江區，舊紹興各縣産平水綠茶十萬担，湖州各屬産綠茶五萬担；溫州産紅茶五萬担（六）福建區，於北路·福安·福鼎各縣，産綠茶十萬担，於西路的崇安·建安等縣，産紅茶十萬担。這是大略的計算，年産約九十萬担。以這九十萬担改良的紅綠茶葉，使可與各産茶國作正面的搏鬥，不但老弱的日本綠茶，一打即倒一卽印錫的紅茶，亦不免要退避三舍。不過這統制的方式，對於技術的改良，和生産的一致，以及在宣傳推廣各方面，固然是有他的特長，不過現在的政府和民間，决没有這樣的精神力量。至說到國營，又是談何容易？那麽我們現在的路綫，應該怎樣呢？且作一個結論如下。</p>
<p>資本主義的方式不應走，合作主義的方式一時難得通，而合於近代的國營方式，現在又不能走，那歷祗好走等二和第三的混合的路綫了。這混合路綫，就是由中央和各省政府，把國内的茶區釐訂以後，一方把茶戶組織起來，一方派定人員負責指導。由近及遠，由小而大，三兩年内，先行試做，八年十年後，亦可小成。但無論如何，在目下最感到急迫的，第一是應該從遠調查國内産茶區域的實際情形；第二是從速養成指導茶業的人才，第三是先行組織産茶省份的主管機關和茶業者的一個集團，以便討論一切進行的方案。</p>

<p>日本本來無茶樹，公元八○五年，才由中國傳到了該國。一一九一年卽宋光宗紹熙二年，更輸入了大批茶種，繁殖於各地。他們最初不知道製造茶葉的方法，聘請我國的技師，前往指導；甚至對外輸出，在當初也得委托中國商人來辦理。</p>
<p>自一八七○年以後，日本便開始作茶葉的革新運動，分派人員到中國印度等處作實地的調查考察，並輸入印度的製茶機械，先從事於紅茶的製造，嗣後卽逐年擴充綠茶的機械，以减低製造的成本。其中最使我們驚惕的，爲剪枝施肥等方法的進步，不但茶質的本身得以改進，每畝的收穫量，也大見增加</p>

<p>從上表中，看到茶園面積，雖然很規則的逐年减少；而近三十年中的茶葉製造量，却是極規則的逐漸加多，栽培技術的進步，是最可注意的事實。</p>
<p>日本茶葉進步的推動力是兩方面，一方當然是政府的提倡奬勵；而一方却在有組織有系統的茶葉組合。這茶業組合，不像中國祇是貪圖一部分利益的商人所集合的公會或會館，而是聯合茶戶銷戶茶號茶棧乃至出口商圖謀茶業共同利益的集團。由鄕村而市縣而中央，是有系統的極爲明顯的組織，是類於現在國内所提倡的合作社組織。對内盡指導改良，對外圖宣傳推廣，由政府爲之計畫補助，由組合而向四面八方的作積極的活動。</p>
<p>現在再來說到對外的活動，其實這也就是對於華茶的搏鬥的事實了。因爲日本所産的祇是綠茶，綠茶的外銷，在過去乃至於現在，祗是中國一國。</p>
<p>日本對外的貿易，以前祇有美國及坎拿大兩國，坎拿大的數量又並不多。美國的銷路·在五六十年前，可說完全是中國茶所包辦的；但日本則利用各種的宣傳方法，逐漸地把華茶的地位侵占了。但美國的競爭，已經是過去的陳跡；最令我們痛心的，却是最近幾年中在我國對外銷路最大的俄國和非洲方面的銷路的侵略。因爲最近十年來，日本綠茶惟一的顧客美國，一則由大量的印度錫蘭及爪哇紅茶的輸入，一方又有南美洲的咖啡業，作巨量的傾銷，日本茶祇是年年的減少。但日本人的對外的商業政策，正和其軍事外交的手段一樣，凶辣陰很，無空不入，而且他們不是擇肥而噬，却是乘虛而攻，自然受最大的影響的也就是中國！</p>
<p>中國茶以前最大的紅茶銷路是英國，英國早被印度錫蘭所占據了。次要的綠茶銷路的美國，上面已說過，也被日本所攘奪了。故歐戰以前，大半靠俄國，歐戰以後，多數在非洲，日本人便處心積慮，利用中俄國交的中斷，獻媚俄商；挾其廉價的傾銷方策，花費了巨大的廣告宣傳，向非洲謀出路。結果如何呢？他們是成功了，中國的綠茶外銷，也大受其影嚮了！爲明瞭起見，錄最近日茶外銷的國别與其數字如下（單位千磅）</p>

<p>一九三二年　一六、五六九　二、０二二　四、二七五　一、七三六　九二三　四一五</p>
<p>大最短的時期中，運銷俄國及非洲的數字，眞是突飛猛進，銷俄在一九二六年前，幾無數字可言；現在已占日茶輸出國的第二位；而一九二九年尙未有茶葉輸到非洲，去年卽已到達一百七十餘萬磅的巨額；尤可痛心者，爲運輸入到中國的數字，也將達百萬磅的巨額，這數字不消說是輸入到東三省的茶葉了。</p>
<p>中國的絲業，幾乎已被日本絲所撲滅了；紅茶也早已被印度錫蘭茶所蠶食而一蹶不能復振了，現在苟延殘喘中的綠茶，最大銷路的俄國及菲洲，又被日本茶所侵占，如果再是因循。再不起來抵抗，必將隨生絲與紅茶之後，無法再來收拾了！</p>

<p>中國茶葉製造方法的應該改良，農民産銷組織的應該革新，我們已聽得很熟了；但是如何的改良呢？没有人在進行，也没有人能把成績舉給我們瞧！現在，給與我們也是給與社會以一個極好的消息，就是改良生産，改良組織，不僅是已有了曙光，而且已有實續了，寫在這裏，藉便國人的共賞。</p>

<p>湖南省政府在安化地方，辦了一個茶事試騐塲，今年用機械製造出半機械式的改良綠茶。據說色，香，味，三者俱臻上乘，比較日本綠茶要好得多，湖南是著名的茶産地，人工又極低廉，以爲以前不能改製綠茶，現在是成功了，以後的方針，祗是如何去推廣給民間的問題了。</p>

<p>寗州白鵰坑地方，本來有一個私人組織的大規模的植茶和製茶廠，花了二十萬左右的本錢，因爲不善經營，今年租給中央農業實騐所和上海漢口兩商品檢騐局所合組的茶業改良場。最近寄到上海的茶樣，其一等仿製的改良紅茶色味已可和印錫茶相匹敵，好的印度茶照現在上海市面，每磅値四元左右。其第二三等也與最優的祁門紅茶相類似，祁紅去年的頂價爲二百二十兩，寗紅不過七十兩，其比例爲一與三，該場還是在最短時期以内的第一期的試騐，已能一鳴驚人，給與中國茶業的改良上，以一種最大的刺激了！</p>

<p>祁門的茶葉，現在是中國的紅茶之王。因爲交通的不便，山價和市價，相差總在一倍以上。安徽省政府建設廳，在從前國立茶業試騐塲舊址，創辦了一個省立的茶業改良場。今年除置備了各種新式的機械，以便積極謀改良紅綠茶的製造方法外，一面又替農民組織了個運銷合作社，第一批茶葉已到了上海，不日當可善價而估，這不但開了茶葉合作運銷的先聲，將來能發揚光大，茶葉的生産得以改良，農民的痛苦，也可完全蠲除了。</p>
<p>這不是復興中國茶業聲中最値得報告的事情麽？</p>

<p>— 汪振寰</p>
<p>同樣生在樹上之茶葉，由於製法之各别，大致分爲紅茶綠茶二種，綠茶製法有二，用炒法者曰炒青，用烘法者曰烘青。色香味三者，華茶均較印錫日本等茶爲優越，惟以昔日海運幼稚時期，華茶運至外國，動輒須時數月，甚至竟年，在此長時期旅途中，茶色難免變化，以致影響銷路，茶商乃於出口茶葉，加以人工着色，於是外莊華茶與内銷者有異。茶商以爲着色華茶，初試之時，頗有銷路，實則此種着色茶之消費者，並非歐美各國文明人士，乃外國茶商，以之轉販於其殖民地之有色人種，從中取利而已。蓋歐美人士，以華茶着色，有碍衛生，均不喜飲。吾國綠茶貿易，遂日以衰落。是其鄕結所在，純因着色而起。</p>
<p>是以欲改進綠茶外銷，絕非難事，取締着色改用新法製造而已。此點茶商非不知之，第以着色綠茶，貿易雖衰，而尙可苟延殘喘，如突然取消着色，則恐連今日僅有之銷路而無之。然此言實屬似是而非，蓋今日海運，較前已進步極多，外銷錄茶，旅程時間已爲减少，况有製造綠茶之新法，可使茶葉顔色不變，最近湘贛皖各省，由該省之茶業試騐塲指導試騐之後，已有相當成績，倘今後卽將改良製法，推廣民間，卽可解决前述之困難，縱使貿易不能一時增加，日久必可復甦，進而蒸蒸日上，恢復昔日光榮，是知改進綠茶貿易，並非大難，祗要求商能犧牲一時，毅然取締着色改用新法製造而已。</p>
<p>就紅茶而言，外茶用室内製造，發酵極透，故色澤鮮濃，視之悅目，然除色澤以外，味香兩者，均不遠華茶遠甚。如吾能改善製法，使茶葉發酵濃厚，則除固有之味香以外，更加顔色濃厚，則不難排斥錫印等茶，而獨佔世界市塲也。</p>
<p>是以欲發展華茶貿易，改良製法，最爲重要。實業部上海商品檢騐局最近派遣專員，指導湘贛皖等省之茶業試騐塲，改用新法製造，今年所出新茶，予均加以審查，各種紅茶顔色已較舊法製　者爲濃，卽各種綠茶，其顔色翠如綠玉，且能持久貯藏，可謂華茶改良製法之第一聲，實深堪慶幸之事也。</p>
<p>製法以外，推銷尤爲重要。華茶對外貿易，向由洋行壟斷，絕少直接在外國市塲推銷者。以缺少宣傳，外國人士多不明吾國茶葉之品質，反爲印日商人片面宣傳所蒙蔽。是以製法改良以後，對於國際宣傳及直接貿易上能有所改進，則華茶貿易之興盛，可操左券。最近有駐英吾國某領事，建議吾國改植印度茶種，以資改良，實則吾國茶質爲世界最優者，印茶亦係華茶所移植者也。不過他人能知隨時勢而改進，吾則默守舊法反不如人也。</p>
<p>常有人以成本之高，捐稅之重爲發展商品銷路之障碍。然如品質不改良·宣傳不得宜，縱價格廉宜，終亦爲人唾棄也。</p>

<h3 id="c221">發財秘訣 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>近來在報紙上常可發現許多奇跡，除了某某同志在出讓國土之餘，拜倒莫索里尼門下潛心學道之外，還學習了一點發財的秘訣。秘訣旣關於發財，在目前當然最爲需要，雖然是當這在上者均有亡國的决心，而老百姓亦無身家可保的時候，假如我們僥倖的在三弦上註定了財運流年，很了不起的大大的發財一次，那末最少可以到外國定購一架大號的福特飛機，萬一「誘敵深入」一直到了雨花臺，我們自可以駕起祥雲，聯袂而去。</p>
<p>然則發財之秘訣者何也？曰，唯一的辦法，買彩票，事實勝於雄辯，據說確有二十幾個工人共得了五萬元的香檳頭奬，於是有的可以不再守鰥而打定主意續絃了，有的可以不再在洋行裏當勞什子的職員了，有的在滬戰中受了損失而又可以興旺起來了。總之，突然發財，天大的問題都可得着圓滿解决，甚至於馬上買一個小官，立刻上任，亦無不可，固然這與運道大大有關，可是發財的秘訣也就在此。</p>
<p>而且在目前國難期中，運用這一秘訣的機會也正多着，也就是說目前彩票的種類之多，正如夏季大减價的商店中的「名目繁多，不及備載」一樣，不過最可靠的要算什麽××××建設奬劵了。計頭奬爲五十萬元，二奬亦可各得十萬元，加之預先聲明，不折不扣，「十足給付」。所以這種彩票，不獨是大有希望（因爲「每十張必有一張中奬」之故），而且是十分可靠，不僅此也，除了「鉅大奬額」「希世機會」之外，還有「旣助建設」「復得奬金」的光明正大的政治意義存在。</p>
<p>關於這一節，的確是很足以令人興奮的，事實上在目前除了航空救國之外，便没有第二法門，而且在舉國惶惶的情况之下而來努力建設，更屬堪使敵人咋舌的驚人之舉。可是偉大的建設，必須有鉅大的金錢，而鉅大金錢又祗好來自廣大的民間，於是便有了這「舉國皆獲其益，大衆都能獲奬」的唯一的妙法，使我們老百姓在買了一個良有翅膀的銅質徽章之餘，又「快來加入爲國爲家的工作」了。不成問題，祗消拿出十元，便算是盡了愛國的責任，假如更能獲奬，當然是名利雙收。所以最後我要敬告諸公，大家來呀，「快加入爲國爲家的工作」！</p>

<p>— 幻弈</p>
<p>天下的事，有的眞是使人無從累解的。譬如往往在坐擁幾百十萬家財，面團團的富翁老板，爲了想生個兒子，雖是娶了數十個姨太太，但終於抱着伯道之憂，因爲遺産問題難以解决，弄得走頭無路。同時如住在草棚裏的苦力們，他們連吃飯問題都顧不全，但他們却是人丁興旺，眼見子女一個又一個鑽出來，丢亦不好，養亦不得，也弄得走頭無路，在瞑瞑中造物者彷彿眞的有意同他們開玩笑似的。</p>
<p>自從九一八瀋陽失陷，偏偏遇着了一位大發明家不抵抗主義的張少帥，慷慨大量的，他們要什麽就給他什麽，接連就把東三省一手送掉，把敵人浩浩蕩蕩請進關來。聽說在九一八的那一晚，瀋陽槍砲聲發作的時候，他正是甜歌狂舞得樂極忘返的當兒。後來錦州承他不吝奉送，榆關熱河又告變色，平津風聲驟形緊急，將要擾及他跳舞和打高而夫的清興，他索性捲起舖蓋，把他歷年來一心一德所積聚的心血丨不，是小百姓的脂膏，掛上幾十輛鐵篷車，運進了上海租界，安置妥貼，自已却欣欣然跑往外洋享他的清福去了。</p>
<p>其實我們偌大的中華民國，智謀神通，勇敢善戰，所謂盡忠報國的武裝同志，到處都有，不是在他們自已人火迸的時候？什麽宣言通電，洋洋灑灑，一篇爲國爲民的大道理，說得天花亂墜，就時現在的罷將遊歷的張少帥，也曾耀武揚威，不可一世，出了不止一次的英雄風頭，但偏偏在他皈依參禪，（去年某名流發起金剛道塲，我們的少帥也是發起人之一）大戒殺生的時候，碰到了這種不幸的事情，香伙趕跑了和尙，寗非天命？</p>
<p>多倫被陷唐山失守，用着盌大的字，排在報紙上最顯著的地位，可是在報紙的另一角，四川的劉軍長和鄧總指揮又在熱閙起來，再來一個去年的玩意見，幷且空氣極形緊張，戰雲密佈，形勢擴大有牽動四川全局的可能，據他們的通電，雙方終不外乎都是爲國爲民，不得已而出此正義之戰，至於他們究竟爲了誰國誰民而出此，則通電上没有註明。有人說：他們要是想抗日，那末至少終要待敵人跑到面前再抗還不算遲，方不負抗字的意義，尤其是用兵之道，貴乎熟練，趁這空兒，爲未雨綢繆計，不妨自已人先來練習一下，等到敵軍由黄河北岸向黄河南岸，由長江下游至長江上游達到四川的時候，諸將領均可高枕毋憂的令身歷百戰的士卒們去一以當萬的準備着長期抵抗，勝利豈不是必操左券？</p>
<p>但是，總而言之，歸根結宗，還是我們小百姓的「罪孼深重，」要不然何必要叨煩這輩軍閥老爺們處心遠慮！承蒙他們再這樣的愛護下去，恐怕連小百姓的立錐之地都要没有了啊！</p>

<p>編者按：法律是因爲社會没有辦法之後産生的東西。所以無論什麽事，要是另有解决的可能，最好不要去請敎牠。兄弟之間，貴有濃厚的情感，所以更不應訴諸法律。這件事在法律上，某甲或許要失敗的。他旣提不出證據，又找不到證人。旣經有約在先，在妹子出嫁的時候，你爲何要拿出錢來；除非你願意贈與，你就應當取得某乙的字據。贈與的東西，那裏可以責償於第三者呢？而且這二畝田，乙旣公然佔有至二十年以上，某甲從未發生異議，法律上也無從替你收回。不過這件事，在人情上講來，乙實有酌量賠償甲的義務。照我們看來，起先甲的境况，必不如乙；到妹子出嫁時，甲的境况，必優於乙：現在呢甲恐怕又不如乙了。所以即使没有這一段爪葛，乙也得照顧甲一二，何况他至少還有些理由呢！這件事，全靠中間人妥爲勸解；使甲知道法律上未能必勝，讓步一二：並使乙反躬自省，顧念事實，多出若干。</p>

<p>十三，可憐的孩子</p>
<p>這天下午，張大少爺果然坐在柳姑娘的客廳裏了。</p>
<p>柳姑娘自樓上下來，皮鞋的後跟在樓梯上的絨氈上發出輕微的低音。她照例的懷着疲倦的心情，但在臉上却泛着端莊而美麗的笑容。雖然她自已也覺得這樣的笑臉，多少總有一點不自然，但是這也是一種高深的藝術。這種藝術是她在生活的歷程中所艱苦得來的。只就這一點，可見我們的柳姑娘是何等聰明。</p>
<p>當她走進客聽的時候，第一眼看見的便是張大少爺很禮貌的最大角度的向她鞠躬。其後是他眼睛裏閃着興奮的光輝，仔細看去，似乎連臉上的肌肉也在微微的震顫。然而這種雍容文雅的舉動，反而使柳姑娘覺得可笑，雖然同時也在心頭多少給了他一點憐愛的好意。</p>
<p>「我冒昧得很，姑娘！我這樣大胆的來拜望你，你能够不討厭我嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，張……丨丨呀我應當怎樣稱呼你才好呢？哈哈……」她用手帕掩住了自已的笑聲。</p>
<p>「祇要你高興，姑娘！不是隨便怎樣喊我都好嗎？我的名字是文彬。」</p>
<p>「那末我就很普通的稱呼一聲先生罷，你喜這種稱呼嗎？也許太平淡了哩。」</p>
<p>「不，姑娘！這樣已經很好了。」</p>
<p>「大槪你還是第一次到我家裏來吧，我們好像從來没有見面過似的。」</p>
<p>「對了，到府上來今天還是第一次。不過從前却是見過的，那是前天蘇部長，蘇耕雲先生的老太太做陰壽的晚上，剛好那天蘇部長一定要我帮忙招待，就在那晚上我們見過的。可是因爲客人太多，而且我又不善於招待，所以你也不大記得了。」</p>
<p>「啊！原來是這樣的，那末這樣說來，你和蘇部長大槪也是親戚了？」</p>
<p>於是這位張大少爺便趁勢說明；他現在是外交部做一等科員，蘇部長正是他的直接上司。一口官話，說得很是流利。這使柳姑娘甚爲熱心，在他的眉飛色舞之間，確有不少少年英俊之氣。至於他的一舉一動也是非常瀟洒的，小而至於劃燃一根火柴，也很風流而不落俗態</p>
<p>這一次她熱心的和他談了很久，直到她懶洋洋的　在沙發上打着呵欠。最後聽着他十分誠懇的要求她說：</p>
<p>「今天晚上，我可不可以陪姑娘上劇院去一次呢？」</p>
<p>「可是她没有答應，說是身體不大爽快，而且還勸他不必爲她花錢。其後，他又帶着懇求的口氣說：</p>
<p>「那末你允許我什麽時候再來拜訪你呢？」</p>
<p>「你等着罷，我會親自打電話來請你的哩。」說後還添了一抹濃艶的微笑。但是很可以看得出他還是非常不安，於是她送他走到門口的時候，她再柔和的說：</p>
<p>「謝謝你的好意，讓我們再見罷。」</p>
<p>她望着他的背影，一直等着她在唇邊流出一句：</p>

<p>— 以凡</p>
<p>演員艱險生活之片段</p>
<p>金赫蕭自述十年前事</p>
<p>羅伯蒙高茂ＲobertＭontgomery近赴夏威夷攝製「下面是地獄」（ＨelＢelow）一片。歸後和人談到在火册附近攝製影片之種種艱險工作、被一位老演員呌金赫蕭ＪeanＨersholt的聽見了。他說這算不了什麽。我十年前在「死亡谷」（ＤeailhＶalley）攝製「貪心」（Ｇreed）一片時，那纔呌怕人呢。」人家就請他演講那十年前的故事、，確實很可怕，現在將它譯出，可以指示一般中國的演員，外國製片時爲逼眞起見，應準備怎樣犧牲，應有多少毅力，以致於生命受危險或竟喪失。以下是金赫蕭自述的話：</p>
<p>十年前的死亡谷，和現在大不相同。現在已有避熱的所在，幷有道路可通，但在一九二三年，猶之一八四八年一樣，本尼德探險隊受困於數千里白沙無垠之中，全隊渴死。因爲在死亡谷之中　滴水俱無，寸草不生，熱度高至一百六十度。在夏季的時候，印度土人亦不敢足履其地。可是我及其餘演員等在導演馮斯都漢指導之下，竟在一年之中最熱的七月向死亡谷出發了。</p>
<p>我們經過了長松，拍了幾節戲，就到了斯吉渡，那是死亡谷外的一個小村落。車上裝置的無線電機，忽然損壞了。於是從那地點起，我們就與文明世界隔絕了。後又向前進到了達爾温，在那裏我又遇到了一件很不幸的事。因爲我騎的馬，是匹不可控制的劣馬。他把我摔了下來，受了重傷。可是達爾温地方又没有醫生，所以不能不派人去别舒潑去請醫生。我祗好忍耐著痛苦，靜候醫生的來到。後來醫生來了，由愛克斯光檢騐之下，曉得我摔斷了兩根肋骨並傷了臀骨，至少要養息三星期纔能工作。</p>
<p>導演馮斯都漢於是不得不將我留在後方，自己向前出發。可是「貪心」中的主要演員，祗有我和高蘭二人。我病了，攝影工作就停頓不能進行了。所以馮斯都漢半路又折了回來，和我大閙着。他駡我混蛋，没有良心，偷懶，讓全隊的工作不能進行。最後他硬拖我起來，隨同前去。可憐我祗將息了五天，就從病床上爬了起來，隨了他們出發。在路上一顚一蹶，週身疼痛，呻吟之聲不絕，但祗好忍死前行。我那時對於馮斯都漢之切齒痛恨，實在是筆墨形容不出的。</p>
<p>這樣我們一隊人馬，慢慢地前進着，經過了許多地方，連名稱都是奇特可怕的，一直到一個地方，呌做「火港」。這是死亡谷最深之處，較海面還要低無數丈。這火港中有一小村，是全谷中惟一尋得著生人足跡的地方。在這地方，我們居住下來，拍了兩星期的影戲，在爍石流金的烈日下。再往前就到了「魔鬼的高爾夫球塲，」因爲這是死亡谷中最崎嶇不平的地方。　（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c229">評「前程」 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>記得張石川先生在「明星月報」第一期上曾經說過，「請看我從『脂粉市塲』走向我的『前程』罷，」假如我們對於這句話加以體會，那末，可以看得出他對於這兩個作品，都是頗有信心的。固然在「脂粉市場」中，一般的說來，總算是在水準以上的，可是「前程」呢？却使我們不能滿意了。</p>
<p>當然，我們爲了促進中國電影走上健康的大道，我們得從事忠實的批評。</p>
<p>關於前程的演出，導演的技巧的確是非常不夠的。除了整個的劇情尙能條理不繁的順序的進展以外，在個别的塲面上，有好些是値得我們指示的。第一就是關於主人翁蘇蘭英的描寫、眞不能使人滿意。她旣經做了官太太的時候，物質生活自然很豐富，而且在生活習慣上自然也會大大的改變，這由於她對於小狗的愛好，便可得着證明，可是她除了養小狗之外，却連衣服的「時髦」都不懂得了，甚至要得侍女指示。當裁縫送新裝來的時候，她很封建的討厭他的摸手摸脚，可是到另一個跳舞的場面，却居然肯給人摟着跳舞而忽然「摩登」起來了。第二，當蘇蘭英挾着病了的丈夫走向華貴的醫院的時候，醫院的看護居然排班迎接。自茶房至會計，對於這位太太都維愼　謹的鞠躬致敬。像這樣的塲面眞是太過於「做戲」了。第三，姚君傑做官場後，居然在辦公廳大膽的「荒淫」，也是形容過火而不免失眞的。果然用意在暴露官塲的醜態，但總不至於在辦公廳也會如此。第四，當蘇蘭英望着自己的丈夫和交際花潘雪芬情話綿綿的時候，居然呆呆的站在那裏足有幾分鐘之久，而丈夫却視之若無，可是當初却又手慌脚亂……其他還有許多，可惜一時記不起來。即如那一塲跳舞，也就不値得那麽費力。然而也有不少好的地方：如在高等的病院中看見貧民窟的茅蓬，潘雪芬在旅館中偵察蘇蘭英的行動等等。</p>
<p>然而影片的内容，决不僅限於技巧方面，而故事的健全與否，却是影片的最大關鍵。</p>
<p>那末「前程」的編劇者丁謙平先生却使人們在看過「狂流」和「脂粉市塲」之後，感覺失望了。</p>
<p>一個名媛的女性，果然常會懷着奢强華影片公司新片「我們的生路」中之一幕　范雪朋主演</p>
<p>望，而不免爲社會上有地位的人們所豢養，於是蘇蘭芬便在「一個女人總須有個終身」的解釋之下，而嫁給一個留學生了。其後丈夫做官了，對妻子變心，於是丁謙平先生在畫面上告訴我們說，這個女人在情塲失利而不惜擯棄太太的地位，而仍然過着她的優伶生活。不過字幕上說她是不甘心受男人的侮辱，爲了人格，爲了她的「前程」而從事奮鬥，但是怎樣奮鬥的呢？女主人翁在不接見從前的情人之後，而聳聳肩，一聲苦笑，似乎是說「什麽都完了」！至於一個官太太是否會這樣大徹大悟的勇敢起來？也是我們不敢想像的。然而在編劇者的意旨，在乎解釋「女子職業」問題，雖然事實上是没有出路的等於没有解决。</p>
<p>關於表演，没有一個演員是有成績的。比較的以宣景琳還認眞，朱秋痕也還可以，可是王吉亭却令人難受了。</p>
<p>然而本片的成績，却在佈景和攝影方面，這裏能夠看出中國電影的技巧，還在進步。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c230">評「地獄之花」 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 朱聆</p>
<p>在資本主義制度下的社會裏，戀愛本完全築在金元，鈔票和汽車上面的，所有的交際花以及美麗的少女全會走到大腹便便的富商，銀行家懷抱裏去，窮小子們自然是不敢也不可能去過問。這張「地獄之花」便是寫出美國社會會一般拿金錢作戀愛交換條件的女子的典型。</p>
<p>片中故事可以說很複雜。結局意識矛盾。假如删掉最後一段，而叙述一個拿肉體換金錢的蕩女，原可成爲一部暴露資本主義社會畸形醜態的力作。然而製片家是不願這樣做，硬要加上那段和偵探大團圓的不通的故事，其結果，僅成爲有閒者很平凡的一部消遣品而已！</p>
<p>演出的技巧上很不壞。導演者有點小聰明，開幕時對酒樓「風景線」的幾個特寫鏡頭，巧妙而簡潔。一個頗爲複雜的劇本能演得那樣流利明快確實也不容易。剪接分幕恰當·小動作都有相當的顧及。</p>
<p>女主角梅樊絲尙係第一次現身銀幕，雖無怎樣特殊的貢獻，可是一個極缺少銀幕經騐者能有那樣的成績很是可喜。她的態度始終很自然，把個唯金錢是圖的蕩婦的心情極透澈的表達出來。尤其是在歌唱時的媚態，很有幾分像琪恩哈羅。其他助演者諾亞皮萊平平，蓋雷葛蘭脫頗稱職。</p>
<p>發音，攝影和光線如像其他派拉蒙片子同樣的佳好，背景中的數幕酒樓也極眞逼適當。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Troops Advance Westward in Jixian and Yutian Area <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Huairou and Sanhe Fall Again</p>
<p>Song's Troops Deploy Along the North Canal</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Bomb Our Army Positions Again</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese troops who have occupied the Jixian and Yutian area are still advancing westward in multiple directions, the situation is very tense. It is rumored that there has been fighting in the Sanhe and Xianghe areas, but the details are unclear. Our troops have been retreating to predetermined positions for several days, and the retreat is largely complete. Due to the concentration of large forces in the Tongzhou area, civilians, young and old, are fleeing to Beiping to seek refuge, and the situation is miserable. (Twenty-first Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Our troops are retreating in the hope of peace and to reassure the people, but the Japanese troops are following and pressing closer. Huairou and Sanhe have already fallen again. The enemy is adopting an encirclement strategy towards Beiping and Tianjin, forcing us to accept terms dictated under duress. It is rumored that the conditions they are proposing are extremely harsh. In addition to forcing us to recognize Manchukuo, they also include revisions to the Twenty-One Demands, and there is also talk of special demands regarding interests in Shandong Province. These demands are far removed from our side's position. The riot by plainclothes troops is only a minor issue within the larger problem, but the ambition of the traitors has not died, and they are still thinking of staging another uprising. The situation in Beiping and Tianjin is still a cause for much anxiety. (Twenty-first Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Shunyi reports that our troops are still firmly holding the line at a certain location. Japanese aircraft are bombing daily. Eight Japanese tanks and armored vehicles are still in Miyun. More than a hundred cavalrymen are in Shili Pu, taking no action. (Twenty-first Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Around seven o'clock this morning, six Japanese planes flew over the Jixian-Tongzhou highway and dropped many bombs, destroying the highway. Song's troops withdrew to a safe area and deployed defenses along both banks of the North Canal. On the Ping-Miyun highway, Japanese cavalry outposts reached Shilipu, east of Huairou. The defense of that area is being handled by Fu Zuoyi's troops. Xiao Zhichu's troops are currently deployed at a certain high ground. Telephone communication with Ninghe and Baochi is down. (Twentieth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Many units have been arriving in Beiping from the front lines in recent days. Personnel from the district offices are leading the way in the Chongwenmen, Dongdan, Dongsi, Chaoyangmen, and Bell and Drum Tower areas, occupying civilian houses. Most residents in the eastern city are staying indoors. There are also many troops stationed in barracks in the suburbs. (Twenty-first Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since our troops along various front lines automatically withdrew, the fighting has subsided, but the Japanese troops are still steadily pressing closer. The Japanese military intends to advance to a point beyond which they cannot advance further, to provoke the British and American sides to come forward to mediate and force us into a dictated peace. Their aims are not small. Even if our authorities are determined to achieve peace, it will still take a considerable amount of time and involve many twists and turns. Huang Fu and various authorities have been working hard to stabilize the people's morale in recent days. Although there has been some progress, it has not been very effective. It can be seen that achieving peace without fighting is also very difficult. A certain Mr. Yin, who previously worked hard on the Shanghai Truce Agreement, is currently living in Tokyo and has expressed his desire to serve the party and the country again regarding the post-war settlement of North China. (Twenty-first Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Song Zheyuan's troops received orders to shift to the rear, the Japanese army continued to follow closely. On the evening of the 18th, when the army was withdrawing westward from Jixian, more than ten Japanese armored vehicles, in coordination with more than a thousand infantry and cavalry, fiercely pursued our rear units. From dusk until late at night, they continued to pursue relentlessly. Our troops fought and retreated, and by noon on the 20th, they had completely reached the predetermined defensive line. On the 21st, five enemy planes came again and bombed our lines back and forth, causing many casualties among officers and soldiers, and many vehicles were also bombed and destroyed. Our troops are now holding the new defensive line, and the morale of the officers and soldiers on the front line is extremely high. (Twenty-first Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 7:00 AM on the 21st, over a hundred Japanese and puppet troops, both infantry and cavalry, launched an attack on Fu Zuoyi's troops. Two Japanese planes dropped bombs for an hour but were repelled by our troops, suffering more than ten casualties. At 10:00 AM, five Japanese planes flew over the Ping-Gu highway to Fu's army position and dropped sixty or seventy bombs, including incendiary bombs. We suffered some casualties. The 31st Regiment of the Japanese 8th Division, carrying twenty-one field guns, departed from Miyun towards our lines on the morning of the 21st. Fierce fighting is expected in the next few days. (Twenty-first Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Takata Brigade in Yutian began attacking towards Baochi from the 20th. Ninghe is tense. (Twenty-first Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Because the friendly forces east of Miyun moved westward, causing our line to become too protruding, our troops north of Miyun, in order to facilitate liaison and cooperation with friendly forces to consolidate the defense line, on the evening of the 18th, the troops in the Jiusong Mountain area automatically retreated to the predetermined area south of Miyun. Only a very small number of troops were left to cover the retreat. The Japanese army discovered this, and the next morning, seven or eight planes, in coordination with more than twenty tanks, covered their more than a thousand infantrymen to pursue and attack. Our army calmly responded, and by dusk, they knew that our army had moved to the predetermined location, so they withdrew the covering troops who were tightly holding Jiusong Mountain and transferred them to Shili Pu south of Miyun. The Japanese army knew that we had completely retreated, and at 4:00 PM on the 19th, they entered Miyun County. (Twenty-first Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A certain Japanese newspaper reported this morning that yesterday afternoon, a young man broke into the Japanese barracks with a knife and stabbed Aoyama Jun, a first-class soldier guarding the barracks. Yesterday afternoon, the Japanese side sent a platoon leader of the military police and four soldiers to visit our authorities and raise questions. Our Public Security Bureau requested the Japanese side to extradite the perpetrator for investigation, but the Japanese side firmly refused. The injured guard was also not allowed to be seen. The truth of the matter is unknown. The East Jiaomin Lane belongs to the protected area, and our country's military police have no jurisdiction there, so there is no way to investigate. However, this raises a few questions: (1) Usually, Japanese guards carry rifles with bayonets. Today, there were one soldier and one military police officer. If Zhao Jing only had a bayonet, how could he break into the gate of the barracks and injure a guard? Could these mighty imperial soldiers have become wooden figures? And why didn't the guard fire a single shot, why was he so accommodating? (2) Our side requested the extradition of the perpetrator, but the Japanese refused. Is there actually such a person? This raises a question. (3) It would not be worth it to sacrifice a graduate of a military academy as a soldier for a day. No one but a fool or someone with a mental illness would do this. (4) How could the highest military authority in our country allow someone to assassinate a minor soldier? Isn't this a strange story from the ages? Considering all points, it is enough to prove that the Japanese side's story is unfounded. (Twenty-first Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Tianjin City Was Still Quiet Yesterday; The Plainclothes Riot Plan Was Abandoned <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The plainclothes team planned to riot at dawn on the 21st and requested that bombers come to Tianjin to drop bombs. The Japanese side did not approve, so they abandoned the plan again. However, the plainclothes team has received firearms and has largely dispersed. Less than a hundred people came to the Japanese Concession headquarters on the 21st to collect rations, so the Japanese side was quite dissatisfied. The special operations team captured eight plainclothes team members at the southeast corner of the city on the afternoon of the 21st, two at a time. All were wearing blue cloth overcoats and had a concealed collar badge and an armband. Enemy planes did not come to Tianjin on the 21st, and people's hearts were slightly more at ease. The military and police remained vigilant. At 2:00 PM, they began inspecting pedestrians. At 7:00 PM, trolleybuses stopped running. At 8:00 PM, martial law was imposed. (Twenty-first Dispatch)</p>

Half of the civilian houses in the city were destroyed by artillery fire, and countless people died. However, the two armies are still in a stalemate in Chongning and Guanxian.

Between the separated Liu's and Li's troops, the Ao and Li brigades of the Li's troops advanced into Ziyang from the Qiuxi River on the 16th.

<p>State-Supervised and Merchant-Managed is Easier to Achieve</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Experts from the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have exchanged views on the principles of trade between our country and Russia for several times. Their views can be divided into (1) complete state-run (2) state-supervised and merchant-managed, (3) complete merchant-run. According to the opinions of the Ministry of Industry, complete state-run is feared that the government does not have such huge financial resources, and complete merchant-run is feared that merchants do not have a complete investigation of needs and exchanges, which will inevitably lead to chaotic steps. It seems that state-supervised and merchant-managed is more capable of initiating, and official and commercial cooperation, with the official responsible for the overall import and export, and therefore the merchants responsible for the operation, will not only make merchants feel convenient, but also the Soviet Russian market can get appropriate turnover. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have reportedly not had any objections to this, but the final decision will still be reviewed by the State Council and the Central Political Conference before it can be finalized. It is heard that the Ministry of Industry has drafted this entire plan based on the principle of state-supervised and merchant-managed for government reference. (Twenty-first Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) Gan Jiehou, the Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs in the five southwestern provinces, told reporters today that Soviet Russia wants to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan because Soviet Russia is determined to complete its second five-year plan and is therefore unwilling to declare war on any country. If the proposal to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway is indeed a fact, it will violate the Sino-Russian Agreement of 1924, which China cannot recognize. If the major powers come out to oppose the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Japan may cancel its intention to purchase the railway. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e32">Peace and Disarmament <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>—Shi</p>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt has a positive outlook on the upcoming World Economic Conference. The United Kingdom and the United States have also reached an understanding. The future of the world economy seems to be opening up a new situation from the panic. However, political crises are lurking everywhere. The opportunity for war and turmoil is not only appearing in Europe but has also manifested itself in East Asia. Therefore, President Roosevelt wanted to take the initiative and first proposed a peace declaration, and supported British Prime Minister MacDonald's disarmament proposal to eliminate the deepening of the current political crisis, thereby laying the foundation for the world economy. His intention is sincere and his behavior is also excellent. However, we must have a proper understanding of the current world situation to avoid misrecognition of facts, especially political disputes, which should not be taken lightly. Otherwise, even if temporary peace is restored, it will eventually lead to unexpected events. This is what we hope President Roosevelt will pay attention to.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of March of this year, the Geneva Disarmament Conference has been almost paralyzed. After the British Prime Minister proposed a concrete disarmament plan, Germany insisted on "equality in armaments," France insisted on "security guarantees," and Japan vigorously implemented its military aggression, causing peace to fall into a stalemate. British Prime Minister's trip to Rome, the British-Italian understanding, seemed to be successful. The European dispute may have achieved a relatively understanding result. However, Germany and Italy considered it appropriate, while France believed it would harm its security, and Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, and other countries each held different opinions. The road ahead is rugged, and there may still be many obstacles. Therefore, the coordination plan of the four major powers was shelved due to France's unhappiness, Germany's obstinacy, and the opposition of the Little Entente countries.</p>
<p>We are well aware that the focus of the disarmament issue lies in Europe, especially the conflict between France and Germany. Germany advocates the revival of the German nation and has repeatedly expressed its interest in the so-called "corridor" region. Therefore, the demand for "equality in armaments" has become one of the "national policies" of the National Socialist Party, and the Geneva Disarmament Conference has suffered even greater setbacks.</p>
<p>The U.S. President declared to uphold peace and hoped that all countries could accept the disarmament plan proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald on March 16 of this year. We recall that more than two months ago, Germany insisted on dissatisfaction with the restrictions on land and air forces, and the plan came to a standstill. Hitler's threat caused the displeasure of the United Kingdom and France. What Germany gained was almost zero, and the world economy deteriorated further. Therefore, after the U.S. President proposed universal disarmament, Germany had to express its acceptance to show its moderate spirit and avoid falling into international isolation. Therefore, in the tense atmosphere of the European continent, a glimmer of hope for peace reappeared.</p>
<p>However, the situation in the Far East is very different. Japanese militarists still maintain their long-standing means of aggression. On the surface, they support the strengthening of the "Kellogg-Briand Pact" and greatly agree with the commitment of countries not to invade each other. However, they reserve the so-called "exercise of the right of self-defense." What's more, they even make the special circumstances of the Far East an exception, and the act of armed forces crossing national borders is the activity of the army as police. If this reservation is established, not only will world peace be completely destroyed, but international disarmament will also be empty talk. Moreover, in fact, although the European continent is shrouded in dark clouds, the state of peace has not yet been broken. As for the Far East, the Japanese have already launched military force and are now gradually carrying out aggression to achieve their ambition of gradual encroachment. In this case, it is difficult to desire disarmament and the success of peace.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Four-Power Pact Nearing Completion; Mussolini to Announce Today <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Rome – Negotiations for the Four-Power Pact between Italy, France, Germany, and England have continued to progress this week. The visit to Rome by Göring, a key figure trusted by German Chancellor Hitler, can be seen as proof that the drafting of the pact, which has been underway for several weeks in the diplomatic sphere, is now nearing completion. The British Ambassador, Sir Ronald Graham, met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini this morning, and it is widely expected that Mussolini will announce the completion of the pact in the Chamber of Deputies tomorrow. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) – Negotiations for the Four-Power Pact have made significant progress in recent days. According to official sources, diplomatic talks regarding the pact are being conducted continuously in London, Paris, Rome, and Berlin. These negotiations had been somewhat sidelined due to general public attention on the preliminary talks for the World Economic Conference, but the sudden arrival of Prussian Prime Minister Göring in Rome has once again drawn attention to the matter. According to a Reuters correspondent in Rome, Göring's visit has greatly enlivened diplomatic activity, and rumors suggest that after meeting with Göring, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will meet with the British and French ambassadors. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) – Following today's meeting between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and the British and French ambassadors to Italy, a Berlin news agency announced, citing sources in Rome, that negotiations for the Four-Power Treaty appear to be on the verge of success. It also stated that, under these circumstances, Prussian Prime Minister Göring's presence in Rome is of exceptional significance. The news agency further reported, citing well-informed sources, that Germany will announce its support for the Four-Power Treaty within 24 hours. Once Germany approves, the treaty will be completed. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Rome – Talks on the Four-Power Treaty continue. The draft proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini appears to have entered its final stage. When meeting with Prussian Prime Minister Göring, Mussolini briefed him on his discussions with the British and French ambassadors. Göring departed for Berlin today. Italian officials are optimistic, stating that if a treaty is to be concluded between the four powers, it must be done before the opening of the London Economic Conference. It is widely believed that this expression of sincerity from the four powers will facilitate the success of the London Conference. Yesterday, Mussolini actively mediated on points of disagreement to bring them closer. This process appears to have made significant progress. It is reported that the draft treaty includes a preamble in addition to the main text. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Rome – The Four-Power Pact initiated by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, involving England, France, Germany, and Italy, has once again attracted attention due to the sudden arrival of Prussian Prime Minister Göring in Rome. Göring arrived here yesterday, initially said to be attending discussions on technical issues related to civil aviation. Göring has now met with Mussolini once or twice, and the content of their talks is highly confidential. Rumors suggest that this visit is related to the Four-Power Pact. Some circles in Rome believe that the key to the success or failure of the pact now lies in the hands of the Germans. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>US Willing to Join Consultative Pact After Abolishing Offensive Weapons</p>
<p>Endorsing Economic Sanctions Against Aggressor Nations</p>
<p>(Washington) Tonight, the White House issued instructions to disarmament representative Norman Davis. The instructions, totaling eight pages, remain strictly confidential to avoid external commentary before the US attitude towards the British security plan is presented at the disarmament conference. These instructions were issued in response to Davis's request for a clear and detailed statement of US policy, as Europeans want to know what the US will do once the President's call for drastic arms reduction and the practical abolition of offensive weapons is assured. According to reliable sources, the US government is willing to participate in a consultative pact and even encourage other countries to adopt it, but only on the condition of genuine disarmament of existing armaments. However, those who frequently meet with the President and Secretary of State claim that the US will not join any pact without the abolition of offensive weapons. Discussions on disarmament have been ongoing for over a decade without effective results, and superficial measures will be futile. It is expected that Davis will declare in Geneva on Monday that if offensive weapons can be genuinely abolished, the US will endorse economic sanctions against aggressor nations. Secretary of State Hull declined to release the content of the instructions but indicated that after next Monday, the US position on disarmament and security will be clearly revealed, leaving no room for doubt. He also stated that Davis will not make any guarantees on behalf of the US until there is a genuine understanding among European countries. Currently, it is generally believed here that France will hesitate to relinquish its position in Europe granted by peace treaties without some pact guaranteeing military assistance and economic sanctions. To address France's concerns, the US government is now willing to conclude an agreement stipulating that all national armaments be subject to inspection by an international committee.

<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry announced that the Emperor's reply to the US President's telegram is as follows: "I received your Excellency's telegram of the 17th of this month regarding the proposals of the United States government.

(Associated Press, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to well-informed sources, Japan, due to the situation in the Far East, intends to refuse to sign any disarmament convention that stipulates the abolition of "offensive weapons." The accuracy of these rumors has not been officially confirmed as of yet. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>(London) The program of events for entertaining the delegates attending the World Economic Conference has been released. The conference will open on the afternoon of June 12, presided over by the British monarch. That evening, the British government will host a banquet for the delegates at Grosvenor House, with 600 guests.

<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour departed for Geneva at 11:10 this morning. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is believed here that Germany's unexpected acceptance of British Prime Minister MacDonald's disarmament plan is a tactic to force France into the difficult position of either accepting a plan without guaranteed security or bearing the responsibility for obstructing a solution. The future situation depends on what measures US representative Norman Davis will propose for security, what proposals German representative Nadolny will make, and whether the Four-Power diplomatic talks currently underway in Rome will yield results. French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour met with the German ambassador this morning, and the French Cabinet will hold an important meeting tonight to draft instructions for Paul-Boncour, who is scheduled to depart for Geneva tomorrow.

<h3 id="e37">Soviet Government Statement on Roosevelt's Appeal <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Whether Japan Will Support Remains Doubtful</p>
<p>US Adopting More Active Foreign Policy Towards Far East</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia today published an article on US President Roosevelt's disarmament appeal to the heads of state, stating that it does not fully represent the awareness of the more far-sighted elements within the United States regarding the current world situation. The newspaper said that the Soviet government's response will not use diplomatic ambiguities and evasions, as it considers President Roosevelt's proposal to be a step towards the policy that the Soviet Union has been striving to achieve since its founding. While Roosevelt only requests the reduction of armaments, he is sympathetic to MacDonald's disarmament plan. MacDonald's plan, on the one hand, represents a moderate approach to reducing offensive weapons, but on the other hand, it lacks universality and limits disarmament to Europe. The Soviet Union supports any proposal for partial disarmament, but it insists that disarmament must be universal, as it is a country based in both Europe and Asia. The Soviet government strongly agrees with Roosevelt's proposal that no country's troops should cross borders to invade another country. Roosevelt's call for the establishment of a universal non-aggression treaty is also consistent with Soviet policy. The Soviet Union's goal has always been to seek peace, so it will support any steps that facilitate this. If President Roosevelt wants to wage war against methods of economic aggression, he will meet with the Soviet government's firm support. The improvement of the lives of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union is increasing their demands, and the need for the Soviet Union to exchange goods with other countries is also increasing. The Soviet Union is a socialist country, but it enhances peace and eliminates obstacles to economic relations between countries, which is why it cannot support the policies of capitalist countries. It is doubtful whether President Roosevelt's appeal will be supported by the powers with whom he is in close diplomatic relations. His proposals will become a pawn in diplomacy, or be buried in the paperwork of capitalist diplomacy, or be drowned in a tide of insincere declarations. However, the Soviet government will sincerely support Roosevelt's proposals, as only the proletariat can support the rational proposals of the leaders of capitalist countries. Pravda also published an article on the matter, stating that the Soviet Union has always opposed the policy of aggression against other countries' lands and wealth, so President Roosevelt's proposal to conclude a universal non-aggression pact and oppose economic warfare will naturally receive the Soviet Union's support. It then discussed the contradictions between imperialist powers and the extraordinary economic crisis, and Roosevelt's declaration to preserve the results of the Geneva and London conferences to avoid tragic outcomes. The newspaper questioned whether the countries are willing to avoid such tragedies. The US President's appeal has only received lukewarm responses from the countries, with Japan openly opposing it and London rejecting it because it did not mention the war debt issue. The newspaper finally praised Roosevelt's declaration, saying that from a broad perspective, Roosevelt's appeal shows that, due to the world crisis and the situation in the Far East, the United States has adopted a more active foreign policy. The United States wants to find a way out of the current situation, and whether it can succeed will soon be seen. (TASS, 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e38">Central Committee Member Discusses Central Government's Foreign Policy <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(Beijing) A Central Committee member told our reporter on the 21st: (1) The Central Government has always had a comprehensive and consistent foreign policy, particularly towards Japan, adhering to the principles of "no surrender" and "no compromise." However, due to national strength and various other factors, it is often in a passive position. Therefore, in addition to "no surrender" and "no compromise," it is necessary to assess the actual situation and adapt to circumstances. The recent intensification of the war demonstrates that the government will not be forced into submission by violent aggression. Huang Fu's trip to the north is purely due to the increasingly critical situation in North China and the unrest in Tianjin and Beijing. He is following the Central Government's instructions to reorganize the government and stabilize the public mind. Foreign policy is not his responsibility. Recent rumors that Huang Fu's trip north is to handle compromise, negotiations, troop withdrawal, and ceasefire are purely rumors, as far as I know. If the Japanese side wants to negotiate, negotiations can be held at any time. If we were to surrender, we would have already surrendered. Why wait until today, and why make such great sacrifices? As for the establishment of a buffer zone and the demarcation of Tianjin and Beijing as political areas, these are unilateral attempts by the Japanese side. Today, negotiations and peace depend entirely on the Japanese side. If they are sincere in negotiating, negotiations can begin immediately. If they want peace, peace can be achieved immediately. Our side only seeks to uphold the resolutions of the League of Nations and maintain territorial integrity. Any negotiations can be conducted on these terms. Otherwise, even if Tianjin and Beijing are lost and North China falls, it will be difficult to begin negotiations. (2) There are also many rumors regarding the current situation. Since the outbreak of the national crisis, the Central Government has been concentrating national strength and manpower to jointly seek solutions. At the same time, for the sake of consolidating the foundation of the country, it will never tolerate the Red bandits. Years of large-scale suppression have gradually been effective, but in order to completely eliminate them, special orders have been given to the Southwest to send troops to assist in the suppression, and senior officials have been appointed to be responsible for the campaign, so as to avoid the army resisting Japan from being constrained. In the Southwest, due to obstructions and delays, there is often a disconnect with the Central Government's administrative policies. The Central Government has repeatedly sent telegrams to explain, and they should be able to understand. However, outsiders do not understand the truth and believe the rumors, saying that the situation is about to change again. Regardless of the facts, I can say with certainty that in this time of national crisis, no one dares to risk being unjust. If someone disregards national interests and the safety of the nation, attempting to undermine the foundation of the country, it would be tantamount to digging their own grave and alienating themselves from the people. (3) The meaning of the Central Government's convening of a temporary national representative assembly has been reported in detail by President Wang at the Central Memorial Week. The Southwest initially inquired about the Central Government's intentions due to a lack of understanding, but after the Central Government sent telegrams to explain, they also understood. Rumors that the Southwest will convene a separate assembly in Guangdong are probably unreliable. However, any opinions can be contributed to the Central Government. The Central Government only seeks what is beneficial to the country and will adopt it without exception to gather ideas and broaden knowledge. If they listen to rumors and make reckless attacks, they will only cause disputes and be of no benefit. I hope that the people can work together with the government to overcome the national crisis.

<h3 id="e60">US and UK Conducting Exchange Rate Stabilization <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Roosevelt Invites Bank of England Advisor for Talks</p>
<p>Time Ripe for Stabilizing Gold-Dollar and Gold-Pound</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, US President Roosevelt suddenly invited Sir Otto Niemeyer, economic advisor to the Bank of England, to the White House for talks. Treasury Secretary Woodin was also present, and it is reported that consultations will continue tomorrow. It is widely believed that this is the first step by the US to stabilize international currency prices. The talks between Roosevelt and Niemeyer today were not announced beforehand, and stabilizing exchange rates has not been a major topic in recent talks between the US President and foreign representatives. However, US government officials indicated earlier this week that major financial countries will attempt to agree on a stable exchange rate agreement before the opening of the World Economic Conference, as there have been no drastic fluctuations in the exchange market recently, and the time is ripe for stabilizing the gold-dollar and gold-pound. As for silver prices, it is reported that they were not discussed today. Undersecretary of State Moley also stated in a radio broadcast today that the silver issue will be left to the London Conference to decide, and that it is now the time for central banks of various countries to maintain the closest cooperation. The fact that the silver issue must be left to the London Conference can be seen as an indication that the stabilization of the Anglo-American-French exchange rates will be the first priority. According to Moley, the main purpose of the silver issue is to sufficiently increase silver prices so as to increase the purchasing power of Latin America and China. As for the war debt issue, Moley only reiterated the US government's previous declaration, stating that it will discuss the issue individually with the debtor countries during the economic conference and that it cannot be discussed together with general economic issues. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) News from Paris and London states that the US, UK, and France will establish a public fund to stabilize the prices of the franc, pound, and dollar. However, Secretary of State Hull stated that while representatives of major countries mentioned this issue to State Department officials during talks in Washington, no compromise was reached. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Professor Raymond Moley, Undersecretary of State and close advisor to President Roosevelt, published an article today warning the world not to have excessive expectations for the World Economic Conference and not to assume that the international monetary system can be restored immediately. It is also necessary to know that war debts cannot be exchanged for other things, and the world should not expect the economic conference itself to be able to devise a plan to solve various international economic problems and alleviate world suffering. Even with regard to trade barriers, it is difficult to launch a fierce attack on these barriers. The most difficult task of the economic conference is the removal of trade barriers. The silver issue is also important, not only as a problem of using silver as currency, but also as a problem of increasing silver prices so that countries in the East and South America can purchase American goods. He predicted that the economic conference may agree to immediately return to central bank implementation of monetary policy, supplemented by timely internal administrative expenses and the gradual removal of exchange restrictions.

<h3 id="e61">The French-American War Debt Problem <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) According to news from Paris, the French government firmly believes that the United States will not allow postponement of the war debt due on June 15th of this year. It has therefore decided that upon the expiration of the deadline, it will not pay any of the outstanding amounts, including those due on December 15th of last year. The White House is unwilling to comment on this news, and political circles are greatly shocked. It is said that Roosevelt has always believed that since war debts can be repaid with silver, the burden on debtor nations has obviously been reduced. All debtor nations should at least partially repay the war debt due on June 15th. Communication between Roosevelt and the debtor nations has been continuous. It is generally believed that when Roosevelt met with Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, financial advisor to the Bank of England, yesterday, they discussed this issue. What we should pay attention to is that although American political circles believe that there is no clear relationship between the war debt problem and the disarmament problem, they also recognize that they are intertwined. The attitude of the United States Congress towards the war debt will inevitably be affected by the outcome of the disarmament conference. Washington is very pessimistic about Geneva, fearing that the proposals to be put forward by the disarmament representative Davis in the name of the United States next week will not satisfy the expectations of Western countries. Faced with militaristic Germany, these countries may deem the United States' proposal insufficient and refuse to reduce their armaments significantly. However, from the perspective of the United States, Roosevelt's proposal, given the current attitude of Congress, can be said to have done everything possible. This can be seen from the declaration made by Democratic Senator Robinson in the Senate this afternoon. Moreover, even though the State Department has repeatedly urged the passage of the resolution authorizing the President to prohibit the export of munitions, the Senate has still shelved it and not voted on it. Under such circumstances, if Roosevelt makes people suspect that he is prepared to show generosity to debtor nations, his political position will be adversely affected. Therefore, Roosevelt is temporarily keeping silent on the war debt problem, waiting for the outcome of Davis's declaration in Geneva. If the European atmosphere clears up after Davis puts forward the United States' proposal, Roosevelt can then use it to advocate a policy of international cooperation with strong arguments. Conversely, if the disarmament conference fails, the failure of the London Economic Conference will be inevitable, and Roosevelt, under the pressure of public opinion, will inevitably turn around and issue another shocking declaration, saying that the United States will no longer be involved in European affairs.

<h3 id="e63">Siamese Overseas Chinese Inspection Delegation Visits the Capital's Construction <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Delegation Members Discuss the Situation of Overseas Chinese in Siam</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Wentian and others from the Siamese Overseas Chinese Return to China Inspection Delegation, along with Phirot Waiyachet, Secretary-General of the Siamese Ministry of Education, a group of six, returned to China from Siam last month. They inspected education construction and revolutionary sites in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shantou, Shanghai, and other places. They arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai a few days ago and are staying at the Overseas Chinese Guesthouse, where they are being guided and received by the Central Overseas Affairs Party Committee. They visited the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and inspected National Central University, Jinling University, the Children's School for Martyrs' Descendants, Nanjing High School, Gulou Kindergarten, and other places. They repeatedly consulted with the Central Government, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and the Ministry of Education regarding overseas Chinese affairs in Siam and how to resolve the problems of educational oppression by the Siamese government. They plan to stay in Nanjing for another two or three days before going to Shanghai and returning to Siam by ship. According to the delegation members, overseas Chinese in Siam often have limited understanding of the situation in their ancestral country. Since the revolution in Siam last year, new policies have been implemented, partly aimed at learning from China's culture and education, and partly aimed at assimilating the Chinese. Moreover, Japanese ambitions are very strong, and they are trying to take the place of the Chinese in Siam. In order to maintain Sino-Siamese relations and trade, transplant Chinese culture, and resist Japanese aggression, the inspection delegation was organized. The Siamese population is estimated at ten million, while the Chinese account for sixty to seventy percent. After hundreds of years of operation by the Chinese, the situation today has been achieved. The leader of the Siamese Nationalist Party is of Chinese descent, and most of the new policies are being managed by the Chinese. The Siamese people are afraid of the growing power of the Chinese, and coupled with the Japanese coveting, the overseas Chinese in Siam are truly worrying. The Siamese government has also restricted the Chinese in education and economics, and even restricted Chinese immigration, in order to establish a supportive policy for the new government. Under these circumstances, the overseas Chinese, even if they have become a force, will also decline. The Siamese government forces Chinese schools to teach Siamese for eighteen hours and forty minutes per week. If this continues, in a few decades, the Chinese will not be able to recognize Chinese characters at all, and will therefore become detached from their ancestral country. Therefore, they hope that the government will negotiate with Siam to abolish this rule. Otherwise, they hope that schools will be established in Shantou and Guangzhou, specializing in enrolling Siamese children of overseas Chinese, in order to break away from the constraints of compulsory education. In addition to invading our country, the Japanese also have a so-called southward policy, to compete with our overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. They also collect art albums, supplemented with research, claiming that Japanese and Siamese cultures have been interconnected since ancient times and should be friendly to each other. They also take various Sino-Japanese treaties and print them in the Siamese Navy Gazette, to slander and insult and to alienate Sino-Siamese relations. If we do not urgently plan for this, the consequences will be unimaginable. (Central News Agency telegram, 21st)</p>

<p>Will Go to Nanjing to Visit Wang Jingwei to Discuss Candidates for the Provincial Committee</p>
<p>Determined to Launch a General Offensive Against the Bandit Nests in the Three Provinces in Early July</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Liu Zhenhua, Chairman of Anhui Province, visited Chairman Chiang Kai-shek again on the 20th to discuss Anhui's provincial affairs. Liu told the Central News Agency reporter that after the new appointment of the National Government arrives in Jiangxi, he will go to Nanjing to visit President Wang Jingwei to ask for instructions on policy guidelines and discuss candidates for the provincial committee, and then go to Anhui to take office. He will stay for half a month and return to Henan to supervise the suppression of the Red bandits. It is expected that a general offensive will be launched against the bandit nests in the three provinces in early July, so as not to allow them to expand daily and restrain the military's efforts to resist the enemy. The Anhui Provincial Party Department recently sent a telegram urging him to take office, which is not a problem. However, he will take office only after the military arrangements for suppressing the bandits are properly arranged. He also said that whether suppressing bandits or governing, one cannot be separated from the people, and one should always consider the people and seek the happiness of the people. It is also heard that Ma Lingfu has been appointed as a member of the Anhui Provincial Government. (Central News Agency telegram, 20th)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) The Jiangxi Headquarters received a telegram from Chen Cheng on the 21st stating that Shen Fangqiao's fake Third Army Group fled towards Gangxia, leaving only a covering force of 200 men, escaping along the broken bridge, Guancang, and Qianchalukou areas. According to bandits who surrendered with their weapons, the main force of Zhu De and Mao Zedong's bandits is currently engaged in reorganization in the Fenban, Luofangqiao, Shenfangqiao, and Fuzhang areas. Within the next month or two, they have no ability to escape. If the National Army launches an attack at this time, it will not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. The fake First Army Group was reorganized into four divisions after being defeated in the Huguan battle and no longer has the name of an army. After repeated battles in Huangpi, Dongpi, Huangshidu, Nanfeng, and Lean, almost all of its elite troops were killed or wounded. Although strong conscription of young men has been carried out recently, the new bandits have no combat experience and are unwilling to become bandits, so they are not worth attacking. Moreover, Mao Zedong is suffering from lung disease and is now in the third stage, in a very critical condition. (Central News Agency telegram, 21st)</p>

<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: From the perspective of the current political situation, the retention of Finance Minister Takahashi by the House of Peers is a matter of course. Ultimately, Prime Minister Saito's success in retaining the Finance Minister can be seen as a victory for the pro-cabinet continuation faction. The House of Peers, feeling dissatisfied that the Finance Minister's resignation issue caused political unrest for a month and a half after the end of the parliament, advocated swiftly eliminating this unrest, publishing a political belief, and indicating the government's path forward. This is a major urgent task for Prime Minister Saito. On the government's side, because it is an emergency cabinet, it has been busy with various emergency countermeasures since its establishment. Now that it is entering its second phase of activity, the Finance Minister's resignation issue has repeatedly arisen, and the Seiyukai is trying to use this opportunity to sever ties with the government in order to gain a chance to overthrow the cabinet. The intention is clear, leading to a chaotic political situation. It is gratifying that the Finance Minister's clear political attitude was not calculated by the Seiyukai's conspiracy and he expressed his intention to stay. However, even if the Finance Minister stays, if the Seiyukai does not change its attitude of overthrowing the cabinet, the government will only achieve temporary minor stability, and the root of the disaster will still exist. Ultimately, the future of the political situation depends on the Seiyukai's attitude. Therefore, the Seiyukai will temporarily endure and wait for the development of the situation.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: Prime Minister Saito will meet with Finance Minister Takahashi tomorrow. Therefore, he returned to Tokyo from Hayama this morning at 9:00 AM with his wife.</p>
<p>▲ Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: After Prime Minister Saito visited Prince Saionji, the Seiyukai's long-held beliefs have been slightly shaken. However, there are currently two opinions within the party. One is the "advocate of separation" faction, who believe that the Finance Minister will never stay. However, if the Finance Minister's state of mind changes and he decides to stay, they believe that the mission of the current cabinet's establishment has been completed and advocate constitutionalism. When the government prepares the next year's budget, they will raise the Seiyukai's own policies and separate from the government, challenging the government with the determination to dissolve the parliament. The other faction is the "advocate of self-respect," who believe that the current cabinet is a so-called cabinet without direction or power, so the Seiyukai does not need to put pressure on it, and the government will naturally collapse.</p>
<p>▲ Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: Cabinet Secretary Horikiri visited Prime Minister Saito in Hayama last night around 8:00 PM, listened to the details of the meeting with Prince Saionji, and then left. The government believes that as a result of the Prime Minister's visit to Prince Saionji, the Finance Minister's retention can be expected to be realized, so it is optimistic about this issue. After meeting with the Finance Minister on the 22nd, the Prime Minister intends to ask the Finance Minister to publicly announce the reasons for his retention in order to stabilize the political situation.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Hayama, 21st: On the way back from visiting Prince Saionji in Okitsu, Prime Minister Saito got off at Hayama to rest for the weekend. He told the press corps last night that the Emperor's reply to the US President's telegram was only to the extent of etiquette. The specific content must be studied by the government before a reply can be made. Regarding the Finance Minister Takahashi's resignation issue, Prince Saionji is aware of it and is not worried about the political situation. He very much wants to meet with the Finance Minister as soon as possible. The details of the conversation cannot be revealed until after the meeting. However, his hope that the Finance Minister will dismiss his resignation intentions remains unchanged, but he did not want to bother Prince Saionji with this. The government must first resolve the Finance Minister's problem and then address policy issues.</p>

<p>The Bolivian Representative Still Needs to Seek Instructions</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 20th: The Special Committee of the League of Nations handling the dispute between Paraguay and Bolivia discussed for more than three hours. The central issue is that regardless of the two countries' declaration of war, a state of war already existed before the declaration of war, and Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant was not fulfilled. The Paraguayan representative immediately accepted the committee's report, but the Bolivian representative made a reservation and agreed to telegraph the matter to the government to request new instructions.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Geneva, 20th: Today, the Council of the League of Nations held an emergency meeting. The Bolivian representative requested sanctions against Paraguay, saying that Paraguay declared war while mediation efforts were underway and four countries, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru, with the consent of Paraguay, were indeed plotting to achieve peace, which was a violation of the League of Nations Covenant. He also said that Bolivia had previously formally requested the invocation of Article 16 of the Covenant, but the report drafted by the Three-Member Committee of the Council of the League of Nations did not mention sanctions, which was deeply surprising. The report on the Paraguayan-Bolivian dispute drafted by the Three-Member Committee was then unanimously adopted, advocating an immediate ceasefire, the cancellation of the declaration of war by Paraguay, and the conclusion of an arbitration convention by both parties.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 20th: Dr. Frank, Minister of Justice of the German state of Bavaria, recently went to Austria as a representative of the National Socialist Party but was expelled by Austria. Today, he gave a speech to students in Berlin, saying that we must not allow Austrians to be dragged into a situation that conflicts with German interests by a partisan government. We want to work towards German-Austrian unification, because this is a historical necessity and will be the ferry for the future unified Germanic nation. We cannot abandon this goal. The peace treaty clearly states the possibility of amending it through legal procedures, which is what we should strive to achieve.</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, Vienna, 21st: Berlin students held a demonstration against Austria yesterday, presided over by Bavarian Minister of Justice Frank, and delivered a speech. Vienna newspapers have all expressed contempt and indignation at this demonstration. The newspapers are trying to avoid escalating the already tense situation, but clearly stated that Austria should seek autonomy and not be interfered with by foreign countries, even those of the same ethnicity. "The Federal Post" specifically refuted the National Socialist Party's slander of the Dollfuss government, saying that it had taken brutal actions, and protested Frank's declaration, saying that Austria had the freedom to take all measures. The communist "Red Flag" newspaper said that the new German ideology of Frank's mouth does not conceal that he intends to make Austria a sphere of German interests, to rank among Manchuria.</p>

<p>Stabilize the People's Hearts and Maintain Peace</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: After the Japanese troops penetrated deeper, Beiping and Tianjin felt threatened. All parties are striving for safety measures for Beiping and Tianjin. After Huang Fu arrived in Beiping, he has been continuously consulting with He Yingqin, Zhang Qun, Huang Shaoxiong, Jiang Bocheng, and important generals in Beiping, Shang Zhen, Xu Tingyao, etc., to earnestly coordinate. The first step is to stabilize the people's hearts and maintain law and order. Huang's visit to the north this time is all in accordance with the central government's intention, acting according to circumstances. The current method is neither compromise nor seeking peace, but to seek peace as the standard under mutual understanding. The initial step in seeking peace is to cease-fire. The armies on both sides must first stop the conflict, and then peace is possible. After the Japanese army advanced to a certain location, they did not advance further. Our army, since yesterday (18th), has also begun to retreat. On the Beining Line, our army is concentrated in Lutai, Ninghe, and other places, setting up defenses along the Duhe River. Tangshan is stationed with puppet troops, with two armored trains stationed in Xugezhuang. The vanguard is holding a position across the river between Xugezhuang and Tangfang with our army. The war in the front has calmed down. All the generals in the front have been summoned by telegram to discuss important matters together. Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, Wan Fulin, and Fu Zuoyi are arriving in Beiping one after another. Huang Fu still visited He Yingqin at Jurentang the night before last at 5:00 PM for a long discussion, exchanging views on diplomatic and military issues until late at night before Huang returned to Fengzeyuan. From 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM on the 19th, Huang received Wang Yitang, Zhou Zuomin, Wang Kemin, Ding Wenjiang, and other members of the Political Affairs Reorganization Committee at Yiniantang. He Yingqin also personally went to Yiniantang to meet with Huang. After 10:00 AM, he received Ning Encheng, Special Commissioner of Finance for Hebei Province, Shi Wei, Director of the Hebei Stamp Tax Bureau, and Bao Yulin, Director of the Beiping Public Security Bureau. At 11:00 AM, Huang again visited He Yingqin at Jurentang and telegraphed Zhang Qun, Jiang Bocheng, Xiong Bin, and others to go to discuss. It is heard that they are still continuing to discuss the policy of stabilizing the people's hearts and consolidating law and order. It was not until noon that the important people returned to their residences to rest. It is planned that after all the generals have arrived, they will gather together again to deliberate at length and then contribute the opinions of all parties to the central government. After obtaining the central government's instructions, they will begin to proceed. How to proceed cannot be discussed at the moment. In the afternoon, Huang personally went to visit the Politician Tang Erhe at Beikoudai Hutong, Xisipailou. He had a brief discussion with Tang on diplomatic issues and returned to Fengzeyuan at 2:00 PM. Huang also sent Gao Lingbai to Tianjin to invite the Politicians Zhang Boling and Zhang Zhitang to Beiping. According to Huang's entourage, Chairman Huang's trip to the north, passing through Jinan and Tianjin, has already met with Presidents Han Fuqu and Yu Xuezhong. After arriving in Beiping, he has also met with Minister He and various military and political authorities multiple times. The purpose of Huang's visit to the north has been announced to the Beiping press. As for the so-called Beiping-Tianjin stabilization plan, it is still under discussion and there is no concrete decision. Huang intends to exchange views with military and political leaders first. After deciding on the principles, he will proceed in accordance with the central government's policy. The rumors that Huang met with certain foreign guests in Beiping are not true. As for the Beiping-Tianjin circles, opinions are divided on whether to support or oppose the plan. Whether the future is smooth will depend on the development of the situation in the most recent days. (19th)</p>

<h3 id="e84">One Aspect of Japanese Military Conspiracy (Tokyo Dispatch) <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Since Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, there have been two different viewpoints within the country on this matter. One is a radical theory, advocating active implementation of its continental policy in military affairs, rejecting the Soviet Union in the north, and invading China in the south. In diplomacy, they continue to be stubborn, supporting the so-called "scorched earth diplomacy," maintaining what they call isolation. Domestically, they vigorously promote a collaborative cabinet under the influence of the military clique, even if they don't outwardly deny parliamentary politics, they strive to explain the necessity of prolonging the state of emergency, and create emergency situations with military force. The other is a moderate and cautious theory, believing that militarily, this is enough, and they should maintain the peak of victory and not be rash, because encountering obstacles would not be worth it. Moreover, the atmosphere of international peace is also very strong, and it would be unwise for Japan to truly isolate itself.</p>
<p>The representatives of the former faction in the military are Army Minister Araki Sadao, Kwantung Army Commander Muto Nobuyoshi, Director-General of Education Hayashi Senjuro, and in literary circles, there are Uchida Kosai, and even Hirao Kiichiro. Among the latter faction, the more influential in the military are former Vice Chief of Staff Mazaki Jinzaburo, and the Governor-General of Korea, Ugaki Kazushige, supports him. In literary circles, there are some members of the Minseito (Constitutional Democratic Party). However, although the latter faction has the General Staff Headquarters in hand, the actual command power of the army administration and the troops in Manchuria is in the hands of the radical faction.</p>
<p>In fact, within the territory of the Three Eastern Provinces, the railway from Dunhua to the Tumen River bank has been completed, and the Japanese army's operations in the Northeast have become more convenient. So, it further developed its aggressive intentions. First, it increased the deployment of two divisions to Manchuria: the entire 7th Division of Asahikawa, the 16th Division of Kyoto, the 5th Division of Hiroshima, and the 3rd Division of Nagoya, drawing elites and sending them to the Northeast, transferring them west of Shanhaiguan, south of the Great Wall, to disturb Hebei, and also instructing Liu Guitang and others to harass Chahar from Dolon. At the same time, it used the excuse of detaining trains to oppress the Chinese Eastern Railway, and said that it would use force. Moreover, it often used the pretext of suppressing bandits to fire guns at the Soviet border, and even sent small units across the Soviet border. Of course, this was to test the true attitude of the Soviet Union. After several tests, it became clear that the Soviet Union was determined to continue its peaceful foreign policy. Therefore, it became more and more impolite towards the Chinese Eastern Railway, declaring that it would engage in border blockade. When the Soviet Union declared its willingness to peacefully transfer the Chinese Eastern Railway, it also stated that it was unwilling to buy it, and even if it did, the value must be below 80 million Japanese yen. This clearly shows that it wants to forcibly occupy it and is a symbol of intentional provocation.</p>
<p>However, people like Mazaki and Ugaki always felt that this was inappropriate, believing that being blindly tyrannical would easily lead to accidents. Little did they know that in fact, it was providing the radical faction with favorable explanations and a favorable environment. Therefore, the cautious theory was ultimately untenable. Mazaki Jinzaburo only got the empty title of General, and the two important military positions of "Vice Chief of Staff" and "Military Councilor" were squeezed out. Ueda Kenkichi (commander of the 9th Division of Kanazawa during the Shanghai Incident), whom the Araki faction trusted, succeeded Mazaki in order to implement his military expansion plan.</p>
<p>Originally, according to the ideals of the moderate faction, it was necessary to take international relations into consideration and not advocate invading Pingjin (Peiping and Tianjin). It should seize the opportunity to negotiate peace terms with China, and attack after the situation in Manchuria stabilized. The radicals believed that taking advantage of the fact that there were many international disputes and the world economic panic was still bottomless, they could do whatever they wanted, and they were not afraid of resistance from various countries. At the same time, they could not come forward to raise any objections. Therefore, he (the Japanese military) first made the three-in-one military giants丨丨General Staff Headquarters, Army Department, Director-General of Education Department丨丨 all the Araki radical faction, and cooperated with the Kwantung Army Headquarters in unison, which was convenient for dealing with China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the peaceful and cautious theory is at most empty talk, and cannot affect any practical action. Therefore, the movement to overthrow the Saito Cabinet, from secretly brewing to open debate, but with the support of the military, has been extended to the present, and no one dares to launch it.</p>
<p>Their plan for North China is to use Tianjin as a base to buy off disgruntled military officers to instigate riots, and to advance their troops in the front lines from Luanzhou and Fengrun to Miyun to put pressure on Pingjin. At the same time, it threatens Shandong and Shanxi, dispersing the gathering power of the Chinese army, in order to implement its old strategy of defeating them one by one, and develop its ambition to invade North China.

<p>Japanese Planes Reconnoiter Beiping Three Times</p>
<p>Anti-Aircraft Shells Injure Civilians</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Beiping. Amidst the rumors of a shortened front line, Huang Fu has arrived in a flurry. He is currently planning measures to calm the people's hearts. The people of Beiping, who were in the midst of a stormy sea, were at a loss. Because of Huang's arrival in Beiping, they began to believe that the central government will have concrete solutions to national crisis, and they are all delighted.</p>
<p>In recent days, the various armies on our front lines have been concentrating on their designated positions. Since the 17th, the eastern front and the defense zone south of Shixia Town have all been in a state of armistice. The situation in North China seems to be developing in a new direction. It is said that each army will undergo some adjustments in the near future. The troops of Wan Fulin and He Zhuguo, which have withdrawn from the battlefield this time, are concentrating their troops in the Yangcun and Langfang areas to reorganize and learn from, and will take a short period of rest and recuperation. They will not be sent to the front for the time being. Although Japanese planes are very active on both sides of the western section of the Beining Railway, there are no active movements. However, nearby villages are often in danger of being bombed, and many villagers have fled to places such as Pingjin. Most of the farming has been suspended. The future food shortage is truly unimaginable. On the Beining front, most of the Japanese troops are gathered in the Kaiping area. Only a small part of the Japanese artillery and more than 2,000 troops of the puppet state army led by Li Jichun entered Tangshan. Our front line is near Xugezhuang, and most of the troops are guarding the Tangfang area. On the evening of the 17th, Japanese armored vehicles once drove to the east of Xugezhuang, lingered for a long time, and then returned to Tangshan Station. This morning (the 19th), two Japanese armored trains came from Tangshan again, stayed briefly in front of Xugezhuang, and then returned to their original route. Our army is deployed on the west bank of the Dou River, the atmosphere is quiet, and there is no battle. On the Pingyu Avenue, our army is still guarding near Yutian, and most of the troops are concentrated in the Gushudian and Lindong areas. After the Japanese army captured Fengrun, most of the troops did not actively advance. It is estimated that there are about 10,000 people stationed near Fengrun. Around 11 a.m. on the 17th, a part of the Japanese army entered Yutian, but only a little over a thousand people. The Japanese army, the Hattori Unit, which occupied Zunhua, has intentions of approaching Shimen Town. Our army is still firmly defending Jixian. The defense zone south of Shixia is still guarded by our army and there has been no change. Three Japanese planes flew to Jiusongling this morning to scout, and dropped bombs, but our army was in the trenches and suffered no losses. As for the Japanese army in eastern Chahar, they are still in Dolon City. Although Liu Guitang, Zhang HaiPeng and the puppet army are planning to attack Guyuan, they dare not act rashly because our army's defenses are tight. The voices of withdrawing troops from Pingjin are getting louder and louder, and the curtain of the current situation has gradually been lifted.</p>
<p>Japanese planes have not been to Beiping for days, and people's hearts have gradually become stable. Unexpectedly, at 9:15 a.m. this morning (the 19th), there was a buzzing sound in the sky again. A Japanese plane flew from the northeast, passed over the city, and flew to Nanyuan to scout. Before long, it returned, circling the entire city several times. Our soldiers guarding the city opened fire with machine guns and anti-aircraft artillery as usual, firing into the sky. The Japanese plane flew north, and came again more than half an hour later. Finally, it flew back to the northeast. It hovered over Beiping for more than an hour, and the atmosphere of relaxation suddenly became tense again. Residents in each city informed each other, and street gossip was all about the planes. The frightened situation was roughly the same as when Japanese planes first scouted Beiping. At that time, Huang Ronghai (also known as Huang Qishun), who sold soda at a stall on the side of the road in the east market entrance of Shuimo Hutong, Dongdan Archway, was near the Henglisheng Coal Shop. The eaves of the shop were hit by an anti-aircraft shell by mistake. With a crash, the roof tiles were smashed. Huang was unable to dodge in time and was hit in the right arm and leg, and was seriously injured. The police station in the first district sent a police officer to Xiehe Hospital for treatment, but his life was not in danger. At that time, a pedestrian named Liu Er and two rickshaw pullers were slightly injured and were not in serious condition. At No. 89 Zhouma City Street, Xuanwumen Outside, the Henan Fellow Association also found a shell. It flew from behind the west room of the association, and the roof tiles were lifted up by the shell. It fell directly outside the east room, penetrated into the room through the glass window, and smashed teapots, teacups and other objects. Resident Zhao Wenliang had already gone out, so he was fortunate not to be injured. In the empty field of the Second Court of the Law School inside Xuanwumen and on Shangxie Street, there were also the same shells falling, but there was no damage. Afterwards, reporters investigated from all parties and believed that the three times that Japanese planes flew over Beiping was a threatening action by the Japanese army, and its intention was still to confuse people. It is said that this morning there was also a Japanese bomber plane that flew to Niulanshan in Shunyi County, northeast of Beiping, and dropped several bombs. The losses are unknown. For a time, rumors spread again in Beiping, and there were various rumors. It is widely rumored that the Japanese army will take further threatening actions before the situation in North China can be stabilized. (19th)</p>

At 11:30 p.m., another bomb exploded in the South City. At 11:40 p.m., more than 20 Japanese soldiers, fully armed, went to Nankai School to provoke our security forces, demanding to visit the school. Our security forces stopped them, saying, "It is late at night, and we cannot visit." The Japanese soldiers immediately fired a volley and threw four hand grenades, snatching four rifles from our side. Our security forces did not fight back and immediately reported to their superiors, who ordered them to remain calm and respond accordingly. At 12:00 a.m., the Japanese barracks in Haiguang Temple fired four cannons again. The gunshots were as dense as a string of pearls. Plainclothes teams were being assembled in Fushimi Street, ready to go. At 1:00 a.m. on the 20th, the artillery fire had not stopped. The plainclothes teams rushed out of the Japanese concession and occupied the 6th district of the 2nd district. The situation was quite serious.</p>
<p>Reactionary elements lurking in a certain concession originally planned a riot on the 18th night, and issued gun passwords, dividing into three routes to attack the Chinese territory. One route attacked the Provincial Government, the Public Security Bureau, and the First Army Headquarters. The second route attacked the East Station. The third route attacked the Caojia Garden Garrison. Their passwords were (1) "Launch", (2) "Love the People", (3) "Success". Temporarily, due to our strict defense, it did not launch. At 12:30 a.m. on the 19th night, our security forces captured two traitors at Nanmenkou, one named Liu Yuqi and the other named Zhang Chenglin, and seized pistols, symbols and other items. They were immediately taken to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Also, on the 19th night, the security in various Chinese concessions in Tianjin became more serious. The Japanese military headquarters in Tianjin ordered the resident corps to inform Japanese and Korean residents to seek safe areas to avoid danger. Merchants in the Japanese concession were also notified by the Japanese police station to close their doors at 8:00 p.m. All important intersections in the south city, the southeast corner of the city, and the Wanguo Bridge were inspected more strictly. All cars and trams must be inspected, especially in the first, second, and third districts, where martial law was declared from 9:00 p.m., prohibiting pedestrians. The French Engineering Bureau also sent patrol officers to inspect the borders between the French and Japanese concessions, and sent armored vehicles to shuttle back and forth. The righteous troops stationed in Tianjin were also fully mobilized to guard the Italian concession. On the 20th, the Tianjin Japanese military headquarters also released many military pigeons with various slogans hanging on their tails. The 10th military train on the Beining Road arrived at the East Station from Tanggu at 8:00 p.m. on the 19th. After the passengers had unloaded, just as the passengers going to Peiping had boarded the train, a soldier saw a wicker package on the first platform, unattended, and smoke was rising from it. He reported it to the railway police. After the railway police checked it, they knew it was bad and immediately left. Suddenly, there was a loud noise in the wicker package. The soldier was bombed, and his flesh and blood flew everywhere. The station was bombed, with an area of ​​four feet deep and six feet in diameter. All the glass in the station was shattered, and the glass in the houses within 100 meters outside the station was also shattered. The 10th train was bombed and caught fire, burning down one first-class special car, one second-class car, and two third-class cars. There was one remaining car. At that time, the fire was very large, and the fire brigade could not rescue it. The locomotive pulled each car to the water tower outside Yangqi, moving back and forth to spray water to extinguish the fire until 10:00 p.m. One railway police officer and more than a dozen passengers were injured, and there were others who had not been identified. At 10:40 p.m., another bomb exploded, the location is unknown. (20th)</p>

<p>Troops are Drawn to Aid the 28th Army</p>
<p>Chongqing Dispatch. Since the outbreak of the second Sichuan war on the 14th of this month, the 24th and 28th armies have been fighting fiercely for days, and the deaths on both sides are over a thousand. Tian Songyao's 29th Army, which is currently busy suppressing the Red Bandits in Tong, Nan, and Ba areas, has been affected by the war in the rear and has stopped its operations. A large part of the front line has been drawn to the rear, claiming armed mediation, but in fact, it is assisting the 28th Army to attack the 24th Army. As for Yang Sen's 20th Army, Luo Zezhou's 23rd Division, Li Jiayu's New Sixth Division in the northern route, and Liu Xiang's 21st Army in the east and south of Sichuan, they are all making military preparations to expand the scope. At the same time, the Red Bandits who are scurrying in the northwest of Sichuan have made a comeback and want to revive. Therefore, the entire Sichuan situation has fallen into chaos. Here are the details of the recent infighting of the Sichuan warlords.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Deng and Liu Telegraphically Report on the Battle Situation <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>(1) Deng Jinkang, the commander of the 28th Army, telegraphed all parties on the 18th, reporting the battle situation as follows: (omitted titles) According to the telegram from Huang Yin, the commander of our Second Division, the enemies facing us are the six units of Li Yushu, Peng Chengfu, Shi Zhaowu, Wang Yuanhu, Cheng Zimin, and Yu Songlin, linking up guns and cannons, and their strength is about 25 regiments. From the beginning of contact on the 13th, local battles occurred. Until dusk on the 14th, the enemy launched a general attack on our entire line. From Guanxian on the right to Qinggangshu on the left, the enemy's line was spread out within a hundred miles along the river, expanding the scope. The enemy facing Guanxian was fiercely attacked by our Gong Brigade, and many enemies were killed. The enemy on the opposite bank of Daijia Bridge, Jinmawu, upstream of Congning, was also repelled by our Zhang and Wang regiments. At night, the enemy heavily attacked Congning City, fighting fiercely for several hours, fighting all night. In Lvxian Bridge, Sandaoyan, Qinggangshu and other places downstream, the enemy also launched fierce attacks, and used guns and cannons to provide strong cover, attempting to cross the river several times, but was repelled by our Sixth and Eighth Regiments, and seized many wooden rafts. In addition to killing those who fell into the water, the rest were captured. Before dawn on the 15th, the enemy concentrated guns and cannons again and fired fiercely between the upstream and downstream of Sandaoyan, and attempted to cross the river by wooden rafts many times, but was still repelled by us. The enemy suffered even more casualties. Until late in the morning, it gradually became silent. In the evening, the enemy moved all lines. Our army abandoned Sandaoyan due to strategic reasons, and the enemy occupied Guan City and attacked our Pi (County) Congning. The enemy surrounded the city, and our Gong (Weiqing) Brigade still made a final resistance, but due to the disparity in numbers, they began to retreat. On the evening of the 16th, the enemy occupied our Congning again and forced their way towards Xin (Du) and Xin (Fan). Our various units concentrated in zhou and Xinfan. On the 17th, a fierce counterattack occurred on all lines. The soldiers fought bravely, and the enemy's Li Brigade was completely annihilated. The various roads are currently in a stalemate. Specially hear etc., Also, according to a telegram from Chen Shunong, the commander of the Third Division, since the 15th, the enemy has put pressure on Ziyang with heavy troops and shelled us first. You (Guangju), the brigade stationed in Ziyang, did not meet the enemy, but withdrew on their own to show peace. The enemy's Chen (Hongwen) unit continued to advance and forcibly seized our Jiancheng. Various taxes were immediately occupied. Our (Wang Wenjun) brigade fought fiercely with the enemy at Feilong Temple all day on the 16th, and the outcome was undecided. The enemy suffered more than a thousand casualties, and our army also suffered four to five hundred casualties. On the morning of the 17th, the enemy reinforced with the Lin (Zeber) division and made a big encirclement of our units, and then advanced and seized Lezhi. Finally, because our officers and soldiers fought for justice, they defeated the enemy with fewer troops and the brigade stationed in Longquan驿 谢德堪 (Xie Dekan) rushed to support, re-approaching Jiancheng, and restoring is expected soon. Also, according to a telegram from Chen Jingshan, the commander of the Independent Division, the enemy's Tang (Ying) Division Wang (Zhiren) various brigades, about ten regiments, advanced from the north gate of Rong to take our Xindu. Our front units Chen and Liao various regiments contacted at Sanhe塲 on the 16th and a fierce battle occurred. The enemy used a death squad of five hundred, naked with broadswords, to pounce on our front line, plotting to occupy Xincheng. The fierce battle continued until noon on the 17th, the enemy retreated due to an attack on the rear by the 29th Army Hu (Kaiying) Brigade. Our unit has now made contact with the various units of the Tian Army and consolidated the front line. Based on this, a special telegram is sent to report, Deng Xihou叩, seal. (2) At the same time, Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army also issued a telegram, reporting the recent battle situation as follows: (omitted titles) According to Li brigade 玉　　　称, our army　　　入敌　　部　no resistance ability, 已克郫 (县) 灌 on the evening of the 15th, and various units are advancing forward. Also, Peng Commander (诚 ) telegraphed that our enemy is small and we are many, and the situation is superior. Since the various units of the enemy have contacted us, they have been defeated section by section and have lost their ability to fight. Most of them are concentrated in Jin (Tang)  (Zhou), and there is a trend of retreating to Song (Pan), Li (Huili), and Mao (功), but according to the confessions of the prisoners in the front line, the 28th Army decided to retreat to the 29th Army's defense zone, please Tian Songyao send troops to cover them. Special hear. Also, according to Chen (Hongwen), the commander of the division, 占领资 (阳) 简 (阳) on the 15th and most of the troops are advancing towards Lezhi. Special telegram. As for the Chengdu area, the security is not chaotic. After Chen (Shunong) fled, no one in the city government was responsible. Wenhui has appointed Wu Jingbo to act temporarily. The Public Security Bureau has been reorganized and is directly under the jurisdiction of the Civil Affairs Department. Zhong Ruwei has been appointed to take charge. Special hear, Liu Wenhui叩 巧晨印.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Liu Xiang's Attitude is Ambiguous and Unclear <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The above two telegrams are the details of the fierce battles between the 28th and 4th armies in recent days. As for Tian Songyao of the 29th Army, and Deng Xihou due to the relationship of interests, (if Liu Wenhui destroys Deng, the 29th Army will also have no hope of survival), although the responsibility for suppressing bandits is heavy, they do not hesitate to abandon it, and draw the various units of the front line that are suppressing bandits, Wang (Mingzhang), Luo (Naiqiong), Zeng (Xiandong), Huang (Zhenggui), Dong (Chang'an), etc., to the rear to assist the 28th Army. The forward troops have already contacted the 24th Army at Kaiying. Tian Songyao also telegraphed to express that if Liu Wenhui is too oppressive and does not accept his mediation, it will affect the progress of suppressing bandits. In addition to reporting all the circumstances to the central government and requesting severe sanctions, he will also open the route when necessary to allow the Red Bandits to scurry into the 24th Army's defense zone. As for Yang Sen in the north, in order to maintain a cautious attitude, he has not expressed any clear position. Only Li Qixiang and Luo Zezhou are making great efforts to prepare for war. If the 24th Army invades Lezhi, their two units will send troops to assist the 28th Army. And Liu Xiang of the 21st Army, who bears the important responsibility of whether the Sichuan war can be expanded, sent Wang Zhiren (the commander of the 13th Brigade) to Chongqing to contact Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army before the war, asking Liu not to inquire about the war. Liu agreed. And the 28th Army sent Huang Shizi, the commander of the Teaching Division Brigade, to Chongqing to ask for assistance with Liu Wenhui's unwarranted coercion. Liu Xiang also agreed. Now, in order to fulfill his responsibility for mediation, Liu has sent representatives Yan Ruqing and Huang Shizi, together with Huang Huanghuai, the representative of the 20th Army, to Xindu to discuss everything with Deng Jinkang. However, Liu Xiang has recently issued a mobilization order, instructing Jing Fan, the Teaching and Second Fourth Division to prepare. It is still ambiguous and unclear which side to assist. The Sichuan war has officially broken out, and the front line has not been fully expanded. The Sichuan Support Association of the Republic of China Anti-Japanese Army here sent a special telegram to the three army commanders of Deng, Tian, and Liu, immediately stopping military action to avoid the expansion of the war, otherwise, they will be the culprits of civil war, casting iron statues, so that under the millennium, we all know the crime of national subjugation, and there is something to blame.

<p>The Chenghuang Temple (Zhang Shicheng Temple) in Heshan, Fengqiao outside Changmen, has always held a race meeting every April. Since the revolutionary army settled down, it has not been held for several years. Unexpectedly, this year it will be held as usual. Yesterday (21st) was the date of the race meeting, and tens of thousands of men and women in the city and countryside went to watch. Although the Public Security Bureau prohibited it, it was ineffective. The ceremonial guards were extremely prosperous, and there were stilt walking and other things. However, due to the excessive number of people, the railing of the Jiangcun Bridge in front of Hanshan Temple collapsed, injuring a woman, but fortunately, there was no danger to her life. The cases of lost children and stolen items are countless and are strange social phenomena. Nantong</p>

<p>The strike at the Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory has subsided. Li Shengbo, the manager of the factory, suddenly left Tong for Shanghai, causing problems with the resumption of work. All the workers of the factory telegraphed the Shanghai Dasheng Board of Directors, requesting them to urge Li to return to the factory to start the machines. On the 20th, directors Zhang Xiaoruo, Li Qiqing, Zhao Shuyong, and Wu Jicheng telegraphed back, "We have received your telegram. During this period of serious national crisis, our factory is heavily in debt and is affected by the decline in the market price of yarn, and is almost on the verge of being unsustainable. It is inevitable to reorganize and innovate. Unexpectedly, a strike occurred and has not been resolved so far. We are deeply worried about the danger of the factory. If it continues for a long time, it will inevitably lead to a loss of credit and there will be no way to resume operations. If the skin is not there, what will the hair be attached to? You must know that whether our factory can exist is not only related to the life of each worker, but also to local charity, education, commerce, security, and other aspects. If each worker can understand this meaning, they should eliminate the old habits and refresh themselves in the future, and abide by the factory rules in everything. If the work is in order, it will be possible to maintain credit and the source of funds will not be cut off. Our association can urge Manager Li to go to the factory as soon as possible to preside over the affairs as usual."</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction established the First Model Sericulture Zone in Nansha, Xiaoshan, and the Second Model Sericulture Zone in Lin'an to improve sericulture. The spring silkworm season is particularly good this year. Xiaoshan District is already harvesting cocoons, and Lin'an District has completely finished placing silkworms on frames. Although the weather suddenly changed in recent days, fortunately, it was not affected. The Department of Construction specially convened relevant parties to organize a cocoon purchasing committee to go to the two districts to purchase fresh cocoons. In the first district, Wu Shenyi, Shen Zubei, Ding Songlin, Zhang Fancun, and six others were recommended as cocoon purchasing committee members, raising more than 600,000 yuan in cash. In the second district, Zhou Hao, Yin Zhengyao, Li Yongchang, and six others were recommended as cocoon committee members, raising 60,000 yuan to start purchasing. It is reported that the association in Xiaoshan District has opened three cocoon markets in advance: Minxin (Kanshan), Tongyuan (Nanyang), and Puyi (Toufeng). The cocoon price is uniformly set at 35 yuan per dan (unit of weight) at the top grade, and 29 yuan per dan at the standard grade, according to the new system of market scales, equivalent to about 43 yuan per dan at the Sima official scale. The remaining fifteen cocoon markets in the district will also open on the 21st. The silkworm season in Lin'an District is slightly later, and is expected to open around the 25th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e93">County Magistrate's Beating Leads to Death <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Zhong, the head of the dispatch and receipt department of the county government in this county, was 26 years old and usually cautious and respectful. County Magistrate Wu Wentai recommended a fellow villager named Cheng Ji as his assistant. Cheng, who was over 40 years old, was extremely addicted to gambling, resulting in a deficit of more than 700 yuan of public funds. Recently, with the handover between the old and new county magistrates imminent, the matter was discovered. Cheng, under the pretext of borrowing money to make up for the deficit, secretly escaped without a trace. The county magistrate then placed Zheng under surveillance and forced his parents, wife, children, and other seven family members to move into the county government for custody, ordering them to pay Cheng's debt by the 19th. However, Zheng's entire family was detained, and there was no way to find Cheng. Therefore, no money was collected by the deadline. County Magistrate Wu Wentai was furious and went to slap Zheng three times, saying, "Choose between death or imprisonment." After being humiliated, Zheng was filled with resentment and swallowed more than two ounces of opium and died. After his death, blood flowed from his mouth and nose, and his family wailed endlessly. On the same day (19th), they drafted a complaint to the county government. The judge approved it, held a court session at night, and summoned witnesses. The plaintiff was Zheng's mother, Ms. So-and-so. The defendant, Wu Wentai, claimed illness and did not appear. The plaintiff requested the detention of the defendant. The judge said that he must wait for a telegram to the High Court for instructions. The defendant is currently the incumbent county magistrate of this county, and this official has no authority to detain him. He ordered them to withdraw temporarily and summoned them for another hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Textile Experts Discuss the Decline of Chinese Yarn and Relief Methods <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Seven Major Reasons for the Decline of Chinese Yarn</p>
<p>Two Fundamental Solutions</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the National Federation of Chinese Cotton Mills previously unanimously decided to reduce working hours by 23% for a fixed period of one month due to poor sales. On the one hand, it appealed to the government to convene yarn merchants and the financial sector to discuss relief for Chinese yarn. There has been no thorough solution, and the one-month period of reduced working hours has expired. The future of Chinese yarn still faces many crises. Yesterday, a reporter met with a textile expert to discuss the crux of the decline of Chinese yarn and thorough reform methods. The following is a record of his detailed talk, which can also serve as a reference for the government and the yarn industry.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Overproduction Is Incorrect <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The current decline of Chinese yarn, which has resulted in reduced working hours, is often attributed to overproduction by those who are unaware. However, this statement is contrary to the facts. The supply of cotton yarn in our country is still insufficient to meet the needs of the people. How can there be overproduction? Comparing it with the United Kingdom, the population of the United Kingdom is one-seventh of ours, while the textile industry in our country, calculated by the number of spindles nationwide, is only one-seventh of theirs. The number of spindles available for each person is only one-tenth of what is needed, therefore, our country's yarn industry needs more production, how can there be overproduction?</p>
<h3 id="e96">Reasons for the Decline of Chinese Yarn <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>However, although production is not excessive, the decline of Chinese yarn is indeed a fact. The reasons for this are extremely complex. Here are some of the reasons: (1) The financial sector concentrates money and refuses to circulate it, or the interest rate is too high to bear. The life of most yarn mills is in the hands of money lenders. This is one reason. (2) The Northeast has been occupied by Japan, and one-third of the Chinese yarn market has been seized. This is also a fatal blow. For example, the Nantong factories have 200,000 spindles, accounting for one-tenth of the national total, and their products rely entirely on the Northeast for sales. Since the occupation, the Northeast Chinese yarn market has been replaced by the Japanese. (3) The Shenxin Yarn Factory accounts for one-fifth of the cotton industry. In the past, it sold well in Yunnan and Guizhou. However, since the frequent internal turmoil, the exchange rate in Yunnan and Guizhou has fallen sharply. Seven Yunnan-Guizhou silver dollars are equivalent to one Shanghai silver dollar. Therefore, Shenxin cotton yarn has no possibility of being sold in Yunnan and Guizhou. This is a result of internal warfare. (4) The great floods in sixteen provinces last year and the civil war have weakened the purchasing power of the people. (5) In the Yangtze River basin, the Japanese sell low price goods at low prices. (6) The Japanese enjoy extraterritorial rights and can freely purchase materials in our interior to avoid taxation, while the Chinese yarn industry is subject to heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies when purchasing materials, resulting in high costs. (7) Compared with Japanese yarn factories, we only know that there is the Federation of Chinese Cotton Mills, but in fact, each operates independently and is not concerned with each other's problems. They are greedy for piecemeal transactions, and their products are of mixed grades and raw materials are not standardized. In addition, Chinese yarn factories, except for spinning coarse yarn that can use local materials, need to use American and Indian raw materials for the rest of the finer yarn. Wages are high, and expenses are large, but the products are not as good as Japanese yarn. On the other hand, the Japanese yarn industry adopts a trust policy, acts in unison in case of trouble, and manipulates the market. The raw materials they use are uniform, and the products are also uniform. As a result, their wages and expenses are more economical. In summary, the decline of Chinese yarn is based on these seven major reasons.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Fundamental Solutions <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>To revitalize Chinese yarn, there are two methods: (1) Our country has a population of 480 million, excluding producers, the remaining pure consumers account for about one-sixth, that is, 80 million people. All those within the reach of national government laws and regulations, such as the clothing and supplies of the army, civil servants, and young students, should be forced to use domestic products. With 80 million people supporting Chinese yarn, why worry about its decline? (2) Please ask the Chinese Yarn Federation to levy a tax of one tael on each piece of cotton yarn, which can yield 3 million yuan per year, and 15 million yuan after five years. Then use this fund to establish a cotton yarn bank, jointly run by merchants and officials, specifically to rescue Chinese yarn. If profits are made annually in this way, after ten years, not only can the Chinese yarn industry be as solid as a rock, but there will also be more than enough strength to eliminate foreign yarn.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Chinese Yarn Mills Decide to Continue Reducing Working Hours <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Market Prices Slightly Improve, Costs Increase</p>
<p>Foreign Goods Dumped, Inventory Not Reduced</p>
<p>Chinese yarn mills, in accordance with the resolution of the National Federation of Chinese Cotton Mills, have implemented a 23% reduction in working hours since the 22nd of last month. After the day and night shifts were suspended for two days, Saturday and Sunday, today marks the end of the one-month period of reduced working hours. The Federation has resolved that after the expiration of the period, each yarn mill should decide on a plan based on its own situation. A reporter from Xinsheng News visited a spokesperson of the Federation. According to him, the Federation is not in a position to interfere with whether the factories will continue to reduce working hours after the expiration. However, at this time, when affected by the dumping of foreign goods, the yarn produced is bound to lose money, and the inventory of yarn has not decreased. The government has not yet implemented any relief measures. In order to maintain survival, it is feared that it will be difficult to recover.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Yarn Price Situation <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>As of the end of April, the total inventory of yarn in various factories in this city was approximately 160,000 bales. May ended yesterday. The lowest yarn price was 182 yuan per bale, and the highest was 192.5 yuan per bale. The lowest raw cotton price was 40.8 yuan per bale, and the highest was 46.95 yuan per bale. This week, the sales of Chinese yarn were mainly in South China, ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 bales per day. Last week, the sales of Chinese yarn were only from 200 to 300 bales per day. Although sales have increased and market prices have slightly improved, raw material prices have also increased accordingly. The yarn produced is still bound to lose money.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Continued Reduction of Working Hours <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>There are a total of 28 Chinese yarn mills in this city, including Hengfeng, Shenxin, Yong'an, Puyi, Weitong, Tongyi, etc., with approximately 1,117,000 spindles and approximately 7,800 looms. The accumulated yarn and cloth have not decreased. At this time of tight finances and high interest rates, it is really powerless to restore the original state. The factories have separately convened meetings and decided to continue the reduction of working hours, still reducing by 23%, and suspending day and night shifts on Saturdays and Sundays. Once the inventory of yarn is reduced and the market price improves, efforts will be made to restore as much as possible. However, Chongxin Textile Company in Tanjia Ferry maintains the original state because it did not reduce working hours last time. Jingwei Pengji Textile Factory on Yuezhou Road, being a waste cotton factory, also did not reduce working hours.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Implementing Austerity <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>In order to maintain survival, the Chinese yarn mills are implementing austerity measures while reducing working hours to save expenses. For example, Shenxin's sixth and fifth factories are laying off workers in various departments. Shenxin's first factory has canceled worker bonuses, which has aroused worker opposition. They have filed petitions with the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau for assistance. Party and government agencies have sent personnel to investigate the matter in order to mediate. It is heard that a few yarn mills, finding it still difficult to maintain operations after reducing working hours, plan to stop the night shift in the loom room and switch to the regular day shift. Those who used to work two looms per person are now working one loom, and the remaining loom is worked by a night shift worker.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Ministry of Industry Relief <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the issue of rescuing Chinese yarn mills, the central government has decided to borrow 20 million yuan from the financial sector in this city to provide relief. Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, after arriving in Shanghai this time, has consulted with the financial sector and relevant parties in this city on the measures. According to banking sources yesterday, the banking sector can express its agreement on borrowing money to rescue Chinese yarn mills. However, the amount of the loan and the fund, etc., still need to be discussed. It is expected that after several more meetings, it can be determined. It is also learned that Minister Chen believes that the fundamental solution for Chinese yarn mills cannot be solved by borrowing money for relief. He plans to establish a Chinese yarn market in Shanghai to allow Chinese yarn to be sold throughout the country. Therefore, he has consulted with yarn merchants on everything and has achieved results.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Executive Yuan Proposes to Issue 2 Million Silk Public Bonds <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Interest Paid by the Ministry of Finance, Principal Repaid by the Two Provincial Governments</p>
<p>In order to rescue the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the Executive Yuan has decided to issue the 2 million silk industry public bonds that were sealed and not issued in the 20th year (of the Republic). The interest will be paid by the Ministry of Finance, and the principal will be repaid by the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces separately. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were ordered to comply with this decision, and the Ministries of Industry and Finance were ordered to properly plan fundamental measures to enable the silk industry to revitalize itself. The original order is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e104">Order to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>For the purpose of issuing an order, it is found that the central government has issued silk industry public bonds twice in the 20th and 21st years to rescue the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, but the silk industry is still declining. If this continues, it will not be able to reverse its decline, nor will it be within the reach of the central government's financial resources. In the future, proper fundamental measures should be planned to enable it to revitalize itself. The Ministries of Industry and Finance, together with the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, should discuss and report on this matter. In addition to issuing this order separately, it is hereby ordered to comply with this.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Order to the Ministry of Finance and the Two Provincial Governments <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>For the purpose of issuing an order, the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been declining recently, and various parties have repeatedly called for assistance. Relief should be given as appropriate. However, since the silk industry public bonds were issued twice in the 20th and 21st years, and with the country facing national disasters, the central government's finances are extremely difficult. In order to expedite matters, it has been decided to issue the 2 million silk industry public bonds that were sealed and not issued in the 20th year. The interest will be paid by the Ministry of Finance, and the principal will be repaid by the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Each department (provincial government) should promptly plan and strictly comply with this, in order to comfort the longing of farmers and merchants. In addition to issuing this order separately, it is hereby urgently ordered to the department (provincial government) to properly plan the specific measures for paying interest (repaying principal) and report them for verification.</p>

<p>The Municipal Farmers' Association Holds a Commemorative Meeting</p>
<p>After the agricultural circles in this city initiated the designation of today as Agriculture Day, it has been adopted by the Shanghai County Farmers' Association and others. The Municipal Farmers' Association will hold a commemorative meeting at 10:00 am at the Hunan District Farmers' Association in Xiaomuqiao, Longhua Road. In the afternoon, there will be a dinner, as well as performances and the screening of agricultural education films. In order to make the farmers in the city understand the commemorative significance of Agriculture Day, the association has specially printed a letter to the farmers in the city, which will be distributed on-site, and has also sent telegrams to the farmers' associations in various provinces and cities to advocate for this day.</p>

<p>Departed for Zhenjiang Yesterday Morning, Departing Today</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board, in order to carefully prepare more than 400,000 pounds of Boxer Indemnity funds for the Huai River Conservancy Commission, has specially invited engineers Chadley of the Shanghai Conservancy Bureau and British national water conservancy consultant Bottley. The Director-General of the Boxer Indemnity Board, Hang Liwu, and the Chief Engineer of the Huai River Conservancy Commission, Xu Kai, etc., will accompany them to the Huai River area to inspect the project and investigate the price of the abandoned Yellow River land used as collateral for the loan. The reporter of the Dagong News Agency has learned the exact information from the British Boxer Indemnity Board that the inspection work has been decided to start at Zhenjiang on the 22nd of this month (i.e., today). Chadley, Bottley, and Hang Liwu have all taken the train from Shanghai to Zhenjiang yesterday morning. They will return to Shanghai after completing the inspection in about two weeks.</p>

<p>Since the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications began communicating with the American Mackay Company on the 18th of this month, most of the telegrams received in the past few days have been commercial in nature. The sound is quite clear. Therefore, Chinese and foreign people in this city are enthusiastically sending telegrams. It is also learned that all national radio stations officially began receiving and transmitting Sino-American commercial reports from the company's radio stations yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e109">County Public Property Office Requests Exemption from Mu Tax Late Fees <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>One-Tenth Already Given to the Poor</p>
<p>How Can Another One Percent Be Borne?</p>
<p>Jiang Shijie, the director of the Shanghai County Public Property Management Office, and Kang Yongnian, the deputy director, telegraphed Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance and Chairman Gu of the Provincial Government yesterday, stating: "The Shanghai County was instructed by your government to add a 1% late fee to the various mu taxes in accordance with the decision of the 541st committee meeting to be used as education funds. The county was ordered to comply, starting with the second term of land value tax in the 21st year, with a limited time to collect the tax and late fee. The people of the county, upon hearing this, deeply doubted the decision. Tax payment is the obligation of citizens, and education funds already have surcharges. Provincial and county surtaxes are charged a 10% late fee for late payment, which is intended to penalize delayed payment. However, the local surtax mu tax is collected along with the regular tax, and there was no late fee originally. Now, suddenly, there is a provincial order to add a 1% late fee to the tax beyond the limited time. This increases the burden on the people and exacerbates their difficulties. The harvest of the county is not as good as in previous years, and the people's strength has been exhausted. Paying taxes on time is already a struggle. How can the wealthy be penalized for delaying payment? It is known that the 10% penalty has been imposed on the poor, and how can another 1% be borne? Moreover, the central government has repeatedly ordered consideration for farmers. We dare to request that, in accordance with this intention, the late fee should no longer be imposed. Shijie and others are close to the people and are well aware of the increasing poverty of the farmers. We cannot remain silent. We hereby telegraph this matter for your consideration and request that you quickly order the Finance Department to instruct Shanghai County to exempt this late fee from implementation, and we will be deeply grateful."</p>
<h3 id="e110">Factory Inspection: Both Parties to Discuss Measures This Week <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Two Inspections Held in the City</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Public Concession's amendment to the Yangjingbang Regulations, attempting to seize our factory inspection rights, has been seriously stated and protested by our municipal government. The Ministry of Industry has also repeatedly sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate, based on the principle of sovereignty. As for the concession side, because it has not obtained the approval of the diplomatic corps, the consular corps is discussing a better solution so as to resolve this issue as soon as possible. The latest news is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Side Consultation: Mayor Wu Tiecheng, after returning to Shanghai from Beijing this time, has decided to consult with the concession authorities on a solution, based on the intention of the central government and the principle of not losing sovereignty. According to municipal government sources, in order to solve the problem as soon as possible, both parties have decided to discuss the measures this week. It is also learned that the French Concession authorities have always taken a consistent approach with the Public Concession on the issue of factory inspection within the concession. They may send representatives to attend the meeting for observation, but it has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Second Inspection: The municipal government has always had the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau set up a special section to handle factory inspection affairs. The first phase of factory inspection in the city has been completed. It is now believed that the first inspection was inevitably incomplete. For the sake of worker safety, a second inspection has begun, and subsequent inspections will be conducted quarterly to ensure that factory safety becomes increasingly solid.</p>
<p>Nanjing Telegram: According to the Ministry of Industry, both parties are still in contact regarding the issue of factory inspection rights in the Shanghai Concession. The outcome will be based on cooperation between the two parties. A cooperative inspection scope has been drafted: (1) Inspect factories in the concession. The local government of China and the concession authorities will jointly send personnel to organize a factory inspection office. (2) Sovereignty of the factory inspection office belongs to China. (3) Inspection personnel will be sent by both parties, and inspections will be carried out jointly by inspectors from both parties. (4) Subsequent improvements to the inspection office or special matters that arise must be requested of the Chinese government before they can take effect.</p>
<h3 id="e111">The Fuhai and Haiying Patrol Ships Ran Aground Successively in Dinghai <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Officers and Soldiers and Weapons All Evacuated</p>
<p>The Administration Bureau Telegraphed to Find Ways to Rescue</p>
<p>The Fuhai and Haiying patrol ships, which are specially responsible for protecting the sea, were dispatched by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Administration Bureau. The ships left Shenjiamen, Dinghai, early yesterday morning to patrol the sea, but soon ran aground in Heyewan and Putuo waters, respectively. After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai Administration Bureau sent personnel to the scene and telegraphed Dinghai to provide assistance nearby. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fuhai Aground: Captain Zhang Ziming of the Fuhai patrol ship, with a total of 36 officers, including special officers, first officer, second officer, chief engineer, second engineer, and soldiers, sailed from Shenjiamen, Dinghai, to Daishan for patrol at 5:00 am on the 19th of this month. At about 6:00 am, when sailing to the Heyewan waters, 60 li away from Dinghai, the ship mistakenly sailed off course and ran aground. First Officer Xin Yuren tried to avoid it, but it was too late. The ship tilted northward and hoisted a flag to request assistance. Fortunately, nearby fishermen saw it and sailed to the rescue in sailboats. They transferred all the officers, soldiers, sailors, and weapons of the ship to sailboats and transported them to Shenjiamen. The office of the bureau there reported to the Shanghai Administration Bureau by telegram.</p>
<p>Haiying Aground: Captain Yang Jingming of the Haiying patrol ship, with a total of 32 officers, including first officer, chief engineer, and soldiers, sailed from Shenjiamen at the same time as the Fuhai at 5:00 am on the 19th of this month to Shanghai. At about 7:00 am, when sailing to the waters off Putuo Mountain, 20 li away from Shenjiamen, the ship encountered fog and ran aground. The ship immediately hoisted a flag to request assistance. Nearby fishing boats, alerted, sailed to the rescue. Fortunately, the ship was not seriously damaged. The officers of the ship were transferred to fishing boats and returned to Shenjiamen to report. The office of the bureau there reported the incident to the Shanghai Administration Bureau by telegram.</p>
<p>Separate Telegrams for Rescue: The patrol ships of the Administration Bureau, including Haihong, Haigu, Haifu, Haiying, Qing'an, Biaohai, and the sixth ship, were all ordered to depart to patrol the waters around Dinghai and other places during this fishing season. Director Chen Zhongsheng and Patrol Commissioner Wang Zhiliang of the Administration Bureau, after receiving the telegram from Shenjiamen, telegraphed the various agencies in Dinghai at 4:00 pm to provide assistance. They also requested that the ships of the Sanbei Company provide assistance when passing the grounding locations of the two patrol ships.</p>
<p>Captain Rushes to Scene: Captain Zhang Ziming of the Fuhai ship, who was in Shanghai on official business, rushed to assist in the rescue by taking the regular Dinghai ship yesterday after receiving news of the ship's grounding. It is also heard that the bottom of the ship was broken after grounding, and seawater entered. It has already sunk. The officers, soldiers, and sailors, along with the weapons, were all rescued. However, the Administration Bureau officially denied this and stated that the Fuhai and Haiying patrol ships are currently being rescued and will be out of danger soon. It is unlikely to sink.</p>

I trust they have met you. The national crisis is severe, and no sacrifice is too great. However, our army is stationed far in northern Mongolia, where the wind and rain are frequent, and transportation is inconvenient and difficult. Raincoats, tarpaulins, automobiles, and other items cannot be procured locally. Please provide assistance to facilitate military transport and encourage the soldiers. I humbly ask for your consideration." Sun Kuiyuan bows respectfully.</p>

<p>Shanghai Guangzhao Association to the Global Chinese Overseas Association:</p>
<p>In reply to your letter and donation register, the Board of Directors has discussed and resolved to donate 1,000 yuan from this association, to be delivered by Guo Shun. It has been found that the compatriots from Mexico who have been expelled from the country are all from Guangdong. The US government purchased tickets to send them to Hong Kong. If they need assistance to return to their hometown, it should also be provided in Hong Kong. If they receive funds in Shanghai, they may end up stranded in Shanghai and unable to return home. Therefore, this association has recently written to Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong, requesting them to take care of the Chinese compatriots from Mexico when they arrive in Hong Kong. In the opinion of this association, all donations should be remitted to Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong for safekeeping and future use.

<h3 id="e115">Planned Double-Tracking on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway at Two Locations <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>And Addition and Extension of Passing Sidings</p>
<p>Approved by the Ministry of Railways and Soon to Be Implemented</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways.  To facilitate traffic, develop business, reduce travel time, and avoid train delays, they proposed laying double tracks between Shanghai and Nanxiang, and between Nanjing and Taipingmen. At other stations, they proposed adding five passing sidings where necessary. Yesterday, the Ministry of Railways ordered the Railway Administration that the submitted plan is beneficial for traffic and business and should be approved.  It instructed them to re-verify and calculate all budget estimates, attach drawings, and submit funding plans to the Ministry for approval.  The "New Voice" News Agency's correspondent in Beijing has obtained the original request from the two Railway Administrations, as follows:</p>
<p>Railway Administration's Submission: Request for Approval. It is noted that the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway has frequent passenger trains, and the traffic at each station is extremely congested. The existing single track is insufficient, leading to situations such as at Nanjing Station, where departing trains are delayed waiting for trains arriving from Zhenjiang, and at Hepingmen Station, where already delayed trains are held to wait for connecting trains. Additionally, stations such as Qiaotouzhen Station lack passing sidings, and other stations have short passing sidings, causing trains to be delayed due to waiting for meetings. This is unavoidable. If improvements are not made, the Railway feels that trains spend too much time at stations, which is uneconomical, and passengers feel that travel is too time-consuming or delayed, which is very inconvenient. Previously, this Bureau instructed the engineering, mechanical, and traffic departments to conduct detailed studies to reduce travel time and avoid delays. The general office also repeatedly ordered thorough improvements. Now, according to the results of the Engineering Department Director's research, it is proposed to lay double tracks between Shanghai and Nanxiang, and between Nanjing and Taipingmen. In other sections, add five passing sidings where necessary, and extend existing passing sidings at each station to 732 meters. A budget of expenses, track materials, and spare parts has been drawn up and checked. The proposed sections are necessary. The original documents are copied and submitted for review. If approved, funding will be arranged to benefit business and convenience passengers. Whether appropriate or not, please instruct to comply. Respectfully submitted (attached copies).</p>
<p>Proposed Plan (Copy): Respectfully submitted, the issue of laying double tracks between Shanghai and Suzhou, adding passing sidings, and extending existing passing sidings has been studied according to instructions. Based on careful research, it is felt that there is no need to lay double tracks between Shanghai and Suzhou. It is believed that the following measures will increase business and alleviate traffic difficulties: (1) Lay double tracks between Shanghai and Nanxiang; (2) Lay double tracks between Nanjing and Taipingmen; (3) Add a passing siding at the 57.5 km mark between Kunshan and Zhengyi, as this area is a large agricultural region and the railway could generate significant revenue; (4) Construct a passing siding at the 92.17 km mark, which is crucial because the distance between Suzhou and Hushu Pass is 12.5 km, and trains are often held at Hushu Pass; (5) Construct a passing siding at the 227 km mark, as the distance between Xinfeng and Zazhe stations is 12.70 km; (6) Construct a passing siding at the 248 km mark between Zhenjiang and Gaozi, as the distance between the two stations is 123.4 km, which will avoid congestion; (7) Construct a 732-meter-long passing siding at Qiaotouzhen Station; (8) Extend the existing 396-meter passing siding at Longtan Station to 732 meters; (9) Other passing sidings should be extended to 732 meters. If double tracks are laid between Shanghai and Nanxiang, and the above-mentioned addition and extension of passing sidings are completed, the current traffic difficulties will be resolved without incurring significant expenses to lay double tracks from Nanxiang to Suzhou, as there is no need to lay double tracks between Nanxiang and Suzhou. Furthermore, it is currently planned to relocate Shanghai North Station to Zhongshan Road and relocate the maintenance depot to the 14 km mark. Therefore, double tracks must be laid between North Station and the depot, and extending these double tracks from the depot to Nanxiang is easy. This is a sufficient reason to lay double tracks between North Station and Nanxiang. Laying double tracks between Nanjing and Taipingmen is extremely important. Currently, Nanjing Station often delays departing trains while waiting for trains arriving from Zhenjiang, and Hepingmen Station often holds already delayed trains to wait for connecting trains. Laying these double tracks will eliminate these problems. For example, on January 31st of this year, Train No. 11 was held at Hepingmen Station for 15 minutes to wait for Train No. 6. If there were double tracks between Nanjing and Taipingmen, Hepingmen Station would not need to hold it. This is just one example. In the future, with the construction of the Nanjing ferry, transportation will become frequent, and such occurrences will become even more common. This is why laying double tracks in this section is crucial. Laying double tracks between Shanghai and Nanxiang will also greatly facilitate the departure of trains from Shanghai. Currently, southbound trains are often held between Nanxiang and Shanghai to wait for northbound trains. This improvement will eliminate this problem.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Mu Ouchu Questions Aviation Salvation Award <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Writes to Wang Xiaolai for Discussion</p>
<p>Mu Ouchu's letter to Wang Xiaolai regarding the Aviation Salvation Award reads: Elder Brother Xiaolai, greetings. I recently read in the newspaper that the Aviation Salvation Award Committee office has been established, and you and six others have been appointed as standing committee members. Initially, I thought this was initiated by the patriotic enthusiasm of the people, but after reading carefully, I realized that the initiator is a Westerner. I don't know what kind of person this Westerner is, but I heard that he started by selling military arms. Regardless of his motives, if he can donate generously, it would be enough to encourage those of our countrymen who are reluctant to part with their wealth. However, there are problematic statements in the preamble. Initially, it says, "Willing to donate the sale price of his houses and land worth 1.5 million, as well as his collection of antiques, to purchase airplanes and military supplies." Later, it says, "After returning the original price and all expenses." If he is willing to donate everything, then why return the original price? There is a clear contradiction, which raises suspicion. However, this might be a typographical error. But considering item five of the later measures, which states, "Willing to recover half of the value, 750,000 yuan, at the lowest possible estimate," then the preamble's statement about donating everything to purchase airplanes is clearly a form of deception and is quite strange. The land on Daxi Road, measuring 8 mu, 4 fen, 7 li, and 1 hao, what is its value? A four-story Western-style house, what is its value? Unless impartially estimated, there are doubts. As for the land measuring 2 mu, 4 fen, and 1 li, its location is unknown, and its price is even more difficult to estimate. The value of the collection of antiques is even more doubtful. I believe there are three incomprehensible points: First, the award tickets are a disguised form of lottery, which is very harmful to the common people and has been explicitly prohibited by the government. Even if the government issues award tickets to promote the construction of aviation and highways, it is only a temporary expedient measure. If an ordinary Westerner issues award tickets in the name of patriotism to obtain a good price because the market is poor and land, houses, and antiques are difficult to sell, if this trend starts, how will we deal with those who follow suit? This is the first incomprehensible point. Second, celebrities are originally role models for society, and their actions can influence society. Now, they are promoting the sale of a Westerner's land, houses, and antiques with great fanfare, using the weaknesses of the people to issue award tickets. Doing this for others seems to harm the reputation of celebrities. This is the second incomprehensible point. Third, assuming that the land, houses, and antiques are worth 750,000 yuan, at this time of national poverty, 750,000 yuan enters the Westerner's hands under the guise of returning the original price. The remaining 250,000 yuan, purportedly donated to purchase airplanes and military supplies, will inevitably flow into the hands of foreigners. It is a very good plan for the Westerner to easily obtain cash for real estate and antiques. But for our countrymen, it requires spending 1.2 million yuan to purchase non-productive real estate and antiques. This is the third incomprehensible point. Because I have doubts about the above, and because we are friends, I dare to speak frankly and present them to you. I ask you to study this matter further to show caution. I am eagerly looking forward to it. Sincerely, Mu Xiangyue, the 20th day of the 5th month of the 22nd year [of the Republic of China].</p>
<h3 id="e117">Northeast Refugee Association Eagerly Awaits Donations <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai United Association of Charitable Organizations for Relief of Northeast Refugees is organized by nine charitable organizations in this city with the longest history of conducting charitable work. Xu Shiying, Wang Zhen, and Xiong Xiling are publicly elected as chairman and vice-chairmen. Mr. Xu and Mr. Wang are stationed at the association daily. Since the outbreak of war in the Northeast and the catastrophic floods in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, at a time when it was mid-winter, the association, regardless of the difficulties, found ways to transport food and cotton clothing and sent personnel to Harbin and other places to distribute them. Tens of thousands of Northeast refugees were saved from freezing and starvation. Subsequently, as the war expanded to inside the customs, the association again dispatched standing committee members Qu Wenliu and Feng Yangshan to reside permanently in Tianjin and Peiping to provide assistance nearby. They also established shelters and soup kitchens in Tangshan, Kailuan, and other places to provide relief to refugees, sparing no effort. Their courageous acts of righteousness have always been admired by society. Previously, when the family members of Commander-in-Chief Wang Delin's troops took refuge in Shanghai, the association, in conjunction with relevant organizations, set up a place to receive them and provided work-study education. Recently, troops under Su Bingwen arrived in Shanghai, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau consulted with the association, and they jointly dispatched personnel to receive them. Upon their initial arrival, the Public Security Bureau advanced more than 590 yuan for automobile, hotel, and food expenses, which the association fully reimbursed. It is heard that all subsequent reception expenses will be borne solely by the association. However, as the war continues, the number of refugees is increasing daily. The association's relief funds are limited, and it is difficult to sustain the effort. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will voluntarily donate and, with patriotic enthusiasm, jointly support this righteous cause of saving the people.</p>

<p>Li Yubi (also known as Li Chunshan), a former Korean revolutionary who had become a Chinese citizen, was abducted on Liyuan Road in Nanshi and disappeared. His wife petitioned the Municipal Public Security Bureau to strictly apprehend the kidnappers and rescue her husband. The Korean Compatriot Alliance also offered a reward of 3,000 yuan for his capture. Now, Li's family has received definite news that Li Chunshan was escorted by police aboard the Nagasaki Maru on the 17th of this month and deported back to his country. Li's wife has reported this to the Korean Compatriot Alliance and the Chinese authorities, requesting negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Silk Trade Associations Discuss Silk Industry Relief Measures <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Elect Representatives to Petition in Beijing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Silk Weaving Industry Association and the Silk Industry Association, in view of the fact that domestic silk products are being seized by the Japanese in overseas markets, attribute the cause to the unusually heavy import duties on rayon, reaching up to 80% ad valorem. This increases the cost of silk fabrics, making it difficult to compete in overseas trade. It is noted that in the past, exports of rayon blended silk fabrics amounted to more than 1 million yuan annually. After the imposition of import duties on rayon last year, silk exports decreased to 2 million yuan. Recently, silk exports have further decreased. If this continues, the future of the silk industry will be difficult to sustain. Yesterday, they held a joint meeting with the Silk Industry Association, with more than ten representatives from both industries, to discuss the matter. The meeting agreed that after the levy of import duties on rayon, the cost of fabrics has increased significantly, making it impossible to export silk fabrics to compete with Japanese silk products. Therefore, both industries elected ten representatives to go to Beijing to petition the Party, government, finance, and industry departments. They will request that all import duties on rayon fabrics and rayon blended fabrics exported to Southeast Asia, India, and other places be refunded, with the aim of competing in trade with Japan and resolving the hidden pain of the domestic silk industry.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Ministry of Finance Consults Municipal Government to Explain Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Collection Methods <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued a document to the Shanghai Municipal Government to explain the methods for collecting tobacco and alcohol business taxes. The document states: For consultation purposes, it is noted that in the 20th year [of the Republic of China], this Ministry consulted provincial and municipal governments to explain five methods for collecting business taxes. Item three stated, "For those who exclusively operate tobacco and alcohol businesses and have already paid the central government's tobacco and alcohol license fee, provinces shall not collect business tax from them. However, stores that sell other goods and also sell tobacco and alcohol shall still pay business tax." The above stipulation in the proviso refers to shops mainly engaged in other goods and also selling small quantities of tobacco and alcohol, and whose business income is not easily divided, shall still pay business tax. However, it is noted that the business tax collection regulations of various provinces and cities have not clearly defined the exemption or collection of business tax for stores that also sell liquor and distilleries. Business tax collection agencies often collect the tobacco and alcohol business tax from stores that mainly sell tobacco and alcohol but also sell other goods, causing appeals and disputes among merchants. In September of the 20th year, the Yongjia Sauce Industry Association of Zhejiang submitted a report stating that the Ninth District Business Tax Bureau ordered businesses that also operate distilleries and sauce shops and have already paid the license tax for liquor to pay taxes from March to June, requesting that this be promptly ordered to be eliminated. After investigation by this Ministry, it was determined that stores or distilleries mainly engaged in tobacco and alcohol and also engaged in other goods, whose main business part has already paid the central government's tobacco and alcohol license tax, should be exempt from business tax, while other businesses should still pay business tax to show distinction. The Governor of Zhejiang Province was instructed to comply with this and instruct all business tax collection agencies in the province to comply, and to transfer the taxes paid from March to June to be eliminated. The situation in each province and city is the same and should be handled accordingly to avoid confusion and disputes. In addition to distribution, the relevant case is consulted to your provincial and municipal governments, and the Finance Department is instructed to instruct the competent authorities under its jurisdiction to comply with it, to further publicize the alliance, this consultation to the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>

<p>Various businesses and firms in the Chinese area of this city believe that the increased telephone fees after the Telephone Bureau's installation of automatic machines are too high to bear. Various industries have sent letters to the association requesting the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward their request to the authorities to cancel the original proposal to increase prices. After the joint submission by the associations of more than forty industries, including tobacco and alcohol restaurants, it was not approved. The association and others yesterday again, in accordance with the provisions of Article 25 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to convene a temporary meeting of member representatives, with a tenth of the member representatives co-signing the request, to discuss and unanimously agree to proceed, because the Chinese market has not recovered to the state before January 28th, that it is necessary to temporarily exempt the increase in fees for relief. Also, the guilds in Nanshi held a meeting yesterday in the dry tobacco guild to discuss and formulate opinions, soliciting consensus from all guilds in the city. Before this case is resolved, they have notified all members to suspend payment.</p>

<p>Mr. Huang Yizhu Steps Forward to Mediate</p>
<p>In recent years, internal disputes have arisen at the Quanzhang Guildhall, with mutual attacks. Although the affairs of the guildhall are still勉强being managed by Yang Jingshi, Chen Weifang, and others, since the internal factions cannot agree, all facilities are inevitably difficult to manage. Furthermore, the establishment of the guildhall was originally intended to connect the feelings of fellow villagers, so it is only natural that everyone try to voice each others' concerns and to strive together, but now they are fighting for power, repelling each other, and have lost the original purpose of the fellow villagers' association. Mr. Huang Yizhu, in view of this, yesterday (the 21st) hosted a banquet on the sixth floor of the Zhongnan Bank, inviting the persons in charge of the guildhall, Mr. Yang Jingshi and Mr. Chen Weifang, and inviting Mr. Xu Jigong, Zhang Yongfu, Chen Wulie, and Zhou Shouqing to come forward to mediate. Mr. Huang enjoys a high reputation among his fellow villagers in southern Fujian and is deeply respected. This time, he stepped forward to mediate, planning for the future happiness of the guildhall, which is of great significance. It can be predicted that he will win the 服of his fellow villagers.</p>

<p>Berlade, the Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, issued a notice yesterday regarding the change of steering gear command for merchant ships navigating the waters, which stated: For the purpose of issuing notices, it is now ordered by the government that all Chinese merchant ship steering gear commands (i.e., driving commands used to convey to the helmsman) shall be implemented with direct meaning from twelve o'clock midnight on May 13th of this year. For example, when the ship is moving forward and the rudder wheel, rudder blade, and bow are to turn to the right, use the English word "Right" to command it. Conversely, if the rudder wheel, rudder blade, and bow are to turn to the left, use the English word "Left" to command it. For ships using manual steering, the commands used must also be handled uniformly, that is, "Right" commands the rudder blade and bow to the right, "Left" commands the rudder blade and bow to the left, etc. Hereby, all shipping merchants are notified accordingly. This is a special announcement.</p>

At the same time, Director Hu gave a speech, describing the founding and purpose of Guangci Hospital, followed by the progress of the hospital's work and future hopes. Finally, Director Hu, on behalf of the poor patients who had benefited, sincerely thanked the Sisters of Charity, Chinese and foreign physicians, and interns from Aurora University's Medical Department who served enthusiastically in the hospital. Then, Mr. Li Tingan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, gave a speech, saying that he was very happy to participate in the event and to see Guangci Hospital's dedication to helping the poor and sick, and its excellent achievements to date. China is currently in a time of natural disasters and man-made calamities, and the problem of food is already difficult to solve. The construction of hospitals is often more in demand than available. Now, with the enthusiasm of Guangci Hospital, more than 100,000 people have benefited, which is very commendable. Finally, Wang Yiting, Lu Bohong, and other celebrities gave speeches (the middle of the speech is omitted).

<h3 id="e133">Mistaking Iodine for Stomach Medicine <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>After Drinking, Consciousness Blurred, Abdominal Pain Like a Knife</p>
<p>Sent to a Relief Center for Treatment, Fortunate to Recover</p>
<p>Qiu Qiaosheng, a 23-year-old from Chuansha, residing at No. 11 Gujia Alley in the Nanshi area, works as a mail sorter, number 723, in the import section of the 18th branch of the post office on Avenue Joffre. Yesterday, being Sunday and therefore a day off, he was resting at home when he suddenly felt dizzy, with a severe onset. His mother-in-law, Zhang Ding, seeing his condition, became very anxious and immediately took a large spoonful of stomach medicine, mixed it with water, and had him drink it. Unexpectedly, not long after drinking it, his consciousness became blurred and his abdominal pain intensified. He was rushed by car to various hospitals in the Nanshi area for treatment, but all were closed on Sunday. He was then taken to the First Relief Hospital of the Chinese Relief Association at the intersection of Rue de Course and Rue Longmen. After examination by the hospital's doctor, his pulse was 140 beats per minute and his temperature was 39 degrees Celsius. Upon testing the stomach medicine he had taken, it was found to be iodine by mistake. After surgery and the administration of an antidote, he was fortunate enough to recover.</p>

<p>丨Started Due to Wage Dispute丨</p>
<p>At the Taikoo Blue Funnel wharf in the western part of Yangjing, Pudong, at 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, a dispute arose between Shandong workers and Hubei workers over wages. They grabbed each other and started fighting. The quarrel was eventually pacified by the foremen of both sides. When work ended, twenty or thirty Shandong workers left through the west gate of the wharf, while more than thirty Hubei workers left through the east gate. Unexpectedly, as if prearranged, both sides gathered in the open space west of the Yizhong Machinery Factory, each wielding iron bars, cudgels, knives, and other weapons. At a word, the two groups started fighting simultaneously, battling for a long time. Many on both sides were injured. Upon receiving the report, the Second Precinct of the Third District immediately dispatched patrol officers to the scene to order them to stop fighting. The head of the 18th sub-station and police also arrived and dispersed the workers. Subsequently, the injured Hubei workers Yang Chengmo, Yu Caiquan, Yang Anguo, Zhang Youfu, Qiu Qingyu, Liu Songkai, Qiu Kuncheng, Wei Heqi, Peng Liangguo, and the injured Shandong workers Zhu Shusheng, Zhu Zuomin, Liu Xingcheng, Zhu Yuanye, Chang Zuoheng, and foreman Wang Anguo, a total of fourteen people, were taken to the police station. After questioning by Director Jiang, they were detained and escorted to the local court for interrogation yesterday morning at 10 a.m.</p>

<p>丨And Quarrels with the Ferryman丨</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 3 p.m., a Japanese person at the ferry crossing outside the west gate of the China Merchants Wharf in Pudong was quarreling with the ferryman. The ferryman accused him of crossing from the Huishan Wharf on the opposite bank to Pudong without paying a single penny, which was very unreasonable. The Japanese person was found to be disguised as a Chinese, wearing a dark blue old cotton-padded jacket and trousers, a peaked cap, and straw sandals with Western socks. If he had not spoken, it would have been difficult to tell that he was Japanese. The China Merchants' police detained the Japanese person and searched his body, finding Japanese clothing underneath and five packs of Little Fairy brand cigarettes and a box of matches in his pocket. He claimed to be Omura Tokumatsu, 23 years old, and said that he had quarreled with the ferryman because he had no money. The police took him to the Second Precinct of the Third District, where the director questioned him again. Because the Japanese person was disguised as a Chinese and had no money to take the ferry, it was likely to cause misunderstandings, so he was ordered to be sent to the headquarters for further action.</p>

<p>丨Wang Huiging Sues Hong Cangting, Et Al.丨</p>
<p>Huada Xingji Tobacco Company, founded by Ningbo magnate Hong Cangting and others, with Hong as chairman of the board, and Hong Weiting as a director and the company's manager. Initially, the business was smooth, but recently, their financial turnover became difficult. They purchased a large amount of tobacco leaves from Henan tobacco merchant Wang Huiging but, lacking cash, gave him a postdated check from Henglai Yuanji Bank for 25,000 yuan. When the check matured on the 25th of last month, Wang presented it to the bank for payment, but Huada had no funds on deposit, so he received nothing. Although he immediately negotiated with Huada, Huada was also in a position where a clever woman could not cook without rice, so there was no result. Now, Wang Huiging, considering that Huada's chairman, Hong Cangting, and others are well-respected magnates in Shanghai, yet they issued bad checks to defraud goods, damaging business credit and personal reputation, and disregarding the capital of others, which is particularly hateful, has retained lawyer Cao Shoulin to file a criminal complaint against Hong Cangting and Hong Weiting. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng of the First Special District Court opened a trial and summoned them. The two defendants also retained lawyers to defend them. After questioning by Judge Huang, because it was necessary to summon additional witnesses, he adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of the 27th of this month.</p>

<p>Whether There Was Negligence Will Be Investigated by the Vehicle Affairs Office</p>
<p>Zhang Hesheng, a 17-year-old youth from Yangzhou residing at No. 94, Xinxin Lane, Dapu Bridge, Rue du Père Robert, French Concession, left home at 7:35 p.m. on the 18th. While crossing the road from west to east in front of No. 412, Rue du Père Robert, he was struck by a No. 12467 car driven by Li Jinhe, a driver from Darcy Motor Company, No. 288 on the same street. He was knocked down and injured in the head. The police, after seeing the accident, recorded the license plate number and sent the injured man to Kwong Chiu Hospital, while taking the driver into custody pending instructions. Zhang died the next day at noon due to the severity of his injuries. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the Auxiliary Yuan Funeral Home for an autopsy. The Vehicle Affairs Office reported the matter to the Second Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Deng Baosun and a forensic doctor to the funeral home. They confirmed that the deceased had died from injuries sustained in an automobile accident. The case was opened, and the prosecutor questioned the victim's family, the defendant, and witness Shao Gengtian about the circumstances of the accident. The official ordered the body to be released to the deceased's mother, Zhang Ge, after she signed a guarantee. The defendant's negligence will be investigated by the Vehicle Affairs Office. It is reported that the victim's family requested a private settlement for damages and has reached an agreement with the defendant to pay 450 yuan.</p>

<p>丨Because There Are Still Defendants Under Review丨</p>
<p>Su Fuwu, a checker at the Far Eastern Sawmill, and worker Li Siting, both from Anhui, had a fight over work matters, resulting in Su Fuwu being stabbed to death on the spot, and Su's nephew and others being beaten and injured. Li Siting was also injured. The Sixth District Police Department arrested Li Siting and brought him to the local court. Li has now recovered, so he was prosecuted. However, the victim's family accused Patrol Officer Wei Jiezhen of the police station of being a co-conspirator in the murder of Su Fuwu and filed a complaint with the court. The prosecutor dismissed the charges against Patrol Officer Wei on the grounds that the accusers had no evidence. The victim's family appealed to the High Court for reconsideration. However, Li Siting, being the one who was prosecuted, was tried yesterday by Judge Guan. According to Li Siting's testimony, "I killed Su Fuwu alone. It had nothing to do with anyone else. However, Su Fuwu was trying to kill me, so I had to resist." The victim's family, Su Hai, and others, all submitted their cases, demanding justice. The official then announced that the case would be suspended because there were still defendants under review and that they would be summoned again after the files were returned. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Burning Legs and Arms with Red-Hot Iron Rods</p>
<p>Neighbors Report to the Authorities Out of Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>Zhang Linquan, a 16-year-old apprentice from Jiangyin at the Tongchang Silk Factory on Rue Robert in Shanghai's west, is very honest and hardworking. He had only been studying at the factory for about a year when the January 28th Shanghai Incident broke out, and the factory stopped working. The apprentice, also frightened, returned to his hometown. He had a package of clothes that he left at the factory because it was inconvenient to carry it at the time. Later, in the eighth month of the lunar calendar, Zhang came to Shanghai to work at the factory. He asked the factory owner for his package of clothes, but the factory owner kept evading him. Later, he learned that the clothes had been pawned. Zhang was even more worried and asked for them more urgently. Later, he changed to asking for the pawn ticket, but he was not given it either. Late last month, Zhang sent a letter to his father. On the 12th of this month, the factory owner, Xu Baoyuan, suddenly received a letter from Zhang's father. Xu opened it and read it. Because the wording in the letter contained a slight sense of insult, and since Xu had several friends next to him, he felt that he had been insulted and was very angry. Xu immediately threw the letter aside and left the factory with his friends. Unexpectedly, Xu's younger brother, Xu Caiyuan, and his unmarried brother-in-law, Xue Yinquan, also became angry out of shame. They immediately tied up the apprentice, Zhang Linquan, with a rope. Xu then placed an iron rod in the furnace to heat it red-hot and burned Zhang's arms all over. He also stabbed Zhang's arms and legs, causing Zhang to faint from the pain. Xue then beat him with a stick, causing blood to flow from his arms and legs, a gruesome sight. After a while, the factory owner, Xu Baoyuan, returned to the factory and saw Zhang lying unconscious on the ground with wounds all over his body. Knowing that he had caused trouble, he immediately took Zhang to the hospital for treatment. By the time Zhang's wounds had healed slightly on the 20th, he left the hospital and rushed to his mother's place. His mother, seeing her son suffering such cruelty, asked about what happened and immediately burst into tears, crying loudly. The matter was heard by neighbors, who came to see what was happening and were all indignant. They then swarmed Zhang Linquan to the district office to file a complaint. The district chief ordered the police to arrest the Xu brothers and Xue Yinquan. After questioning by District Officer Jiang, the factory owner, Xu Baoyuan, confessed that he was out at the time and did not know what had happened. After seeing that Zhang had been injured, he immediately took him to the hospital and severely scolded his younger brother, Caiyuan. Xu Caiyuan confessed that the apprentice had teased his younger sister, Rongmei, so he beat him. Xue Yinquan and Xu Rongmei confessed similarly. After obtaining their confessions, District Officer Jiang, believing that the Xus had dared to use such cruel methods to burn and beat the apprentice, causing him to be covered in wounds, was extremely cruel. He sentenced them to detention pending a document to be sent to the local court for further investigation according to law.</p>

<p>Extorting Money from Illicit Couples</p>
<p>Ten Yuan Still Not Enough to Satisfy Desire</p>
<p>Liu Aguo, from Changzhou, lives in a bungalow without a number on Songpan Road and makes a living by growing vegetables. He previously became acquainted with a widow in Yinxiang Port and brought her back to live with him to help with the work. This was heard by the Yangzhou hoodlum Lu Meijin. On the morning of the 16th of this month at 10 a.m., he went to Liu to extort 16 yuan for a wedding feast, saying that only then would there be no trouble. Liu, fearing his ferocity, had no choice but to hand over his clothes to him, and Lu took them to a nearby pawnshop, pawned them for 10 yuan, and left. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, he and his friend Zhou Yunlong, from Qingjiang, went again to demand 6 yuan, claiming that it was for the cost of the meal at the Hongyun Restaurant at No. 1867 Yangshupu Road and that there was a detailed bill that had to be paid in full, otherwise they would beat him to death. The Yangshupu Police Department received a report and immediately dispatched detectives Shan Zhaoxian and Qi Mengqing to arrest Lu and Zhou and detain them at the police station. The next morning, Judge Wu Zehan of the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court presided over the interrogation. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained what happened and presented the pawn ticket and the menu for investigation. Then, according to Liu Aguo's testimony about what happened, and questioning Lu Meijin, his testimony was evasive. Zhou Yunlong testified that they were old friends and that there was a dispute over a loan. He was only trying to mediate and did not know anything else. He asked for leniency. Judge Wu ruled that Lu Meijin should be fined 20 yuan and Zhou Yunlong should be acquitted and released.</p>

<h3 id="e142">A Large Number of Japanese Blood Flukes Discovered in the Qingyang Port Riverbank <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>丨Dr. Robertson Sends a Letter to the Health Bureau Requesting Attention丨</p>
<p>Dr. Robertson of the Lester Institute of Medical Research in this city sent a letter yesterday to Li Ting'an, Director of the Shanghai Health Bureau, stating that on Sunday, the 14th of this month, he and several technicians from the Institute's Laboratory went to Qingyang Port, near the Yacht Club, to inspect the area. They collected a large number of snails and other similar creatures from the small beaches and riverbanks there. These mollusks are intermediate hosts for Japanese blood flukes. After returning to Shanghai, the Parasitology Department of the Institute's Laboratory examined them and found that these snails were indeed heavily infected. The attached map marks the locations where the infected snails were found with white crosses. This matter should be publicly announced to alert those who camp and swim in the area. It is my responsibility to deliver this announcement. The area near Shiqiao, i.e., north of the railway bridge, where the Chinese Boy Scouts camp, is the most dangerous. Snails infected with Japanese blood flukes are very likely to be present. During the great flood of 1931, snails from upstream ditches were washed into the river. These snails are not harmful in themselves, but unfortunately, they become infected with Japanese blood flukes through human waste and can then transmit the disease to people. As a member of the Western Yacht Club, I have informed the club's secretary-general, explaining the concerns about Qingyang Port. I am deeply concerned that Chinese and foreigners who come here to swim may become infected if they are not careful. Therefore, in addition to notifying Dr. Mierden, I am also reporting to you so that you can take appropriate action. If you permit, I plan to discuss schistosomiasis at the next meeting of the Municipal Public Health Club. If it is possible to discuss with the Boy Scout leaders to convene a Boy Scout group, our association is very willing to send a technician to give a lecture in Chinese. Furthermore, the Minhe bathhouse has been investigated and found to have no risk of such transmission. The Suzhou area is heavily infected. A few days ago, I took snails from a small river at the foot of Tiger Hill in Suzhou and verified that they had the same infection. A map is also attached. The Health Bureau, after receiving this letter, announced that "Japanese blood flukes" are common in Japan and the Jiangzhe provinces of our country. Blood flukes are small worms, the largest about an inch long, living in the blood vessels of the abdomen. Patients are often thin or have swollen abdomens, and severe cases can lead to death. The female worms lay eggs, which break through the blood vessels and enter the intestines, then are excreted in the feces. The small worms hatch from the eggs in the water and invade the snails, multiplying in their livers. They then leave the snail livers and live in the wet mud or on the leaves of plants. If they encounter someone walking barefoot, they will burrow into the body through the skin, settle in the blood vessels, and parasitize. The most important prevention method is to eliminate the snails. This can be done by adding one part of copper sulfate to 500,000 to 2,000,000 parts of water. After 48 hours, the snails will be killed. As for destroying the eggs, lime is more effective. Other methods include using disinfectants. All water from rivers should be disinfected with a one-in-ten-thousand solution of cresol. Other effective prevention methods include not swimming in the area and avoiding walking barefoot. However, Qingyang Port belongs to Kunshan, so the bureau cannot directly handle the matter. It has now sent a detailed letter to the relevant authorities in Kunshan, asking them to take appropriate measures.</p>

<p>Claims to be Busy with Official Duties and Never Returns Home</p>
<p>After Much Inquiry, She Discovers He Has Someone Else</p>
<p>丨The Wife Sues for Divorce After Catching Him in Adultery丨</p>
<p>Lu Suzhen, a 31-year-old woman from Ningbo, resides at No. 217, Dean Lane, North Mountain West Road. On November 17th of last year, she married Shi Mianchen, a native of the same town, through a matchmaker. Shi is 35 years old and works at Guanshengyuan Confectionery. On the night of the wedding, Shi made an excuse to go out, leaving the bride unattended. Afterwards, although he occasionally returned home, he never stayed overnight. The couple never shared a bed, so after more than half a year, Lu is still a virgin. Lu found Shi's actions incomprehensible and repeatedly questioned him. Shi claimed to be too busy with official duties to return home. Lu found this excuse hard to believe, so she inquired in every possible way and finally learned that Shi had someone else. He was living with a widow named Zhou Wei at No. 15, Yiqing Lane, Yiqing Street, in the city. On the morning of February 10th of this year, at 7 a.m., Lu and her mother secretly went to catch them in adultery. They caught Shi and Zhou Wei in bed together. She called the police, who took the adulterous couple to the First Precinct of the Second District Public Security Bureau. They were released on bail. Because Shi had behaved in this way, Lu felt that it was difficult to continue living with him, so she retained lawyers Jiang Yiping and Wu Baotai to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, requesting (1) a divorce, (2) compensation for damages of 5,000 yuan, (3) a monthly living allowance of 50 yuan for three months during the litigation, and (4) payment of litigation costs. Upon receiving the lawsuit, Judge Luo Chongtai of the Special Court summoned them to the Fourth Civil Court yesterday. Shi Mianchen did not appear. After Lu Suzhen testified about what happened, the court said that personnel lawsuits require the defendant to be present for cross-examination. Since the defendant was not present, it was impossible to proceed with the trial. Furthermore, it was necessary to investigate the circumstances of the adultery with the First Precinct of the Second District. The case was adjourned and will be summoned again at a later date.</p>

<p>Change of Venue and Additional Fees</p>
<p>Zhu Dechao, a representative sent by the Shanghai National Goods Promotion Association to Ningbo to discuss soliciting exhibits from Shanghai for the Yin County National Goods Exhibition, met with the National Goods Promotion Alliance Committee. At its fourth meeting on the 19th, the committee decided that the Shanghai collection of exhibits would be handled by the Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, as previously entrusted. The venue for the exhibition was originally planned to be the entire Zhongshan Park in Yin County, but the buildings in the park were scattered, and it would be too expensive to concentrate them in fences. Now, the County Temple has been designated as the venue. The cost of each room has been set at 25 yuan. Factories in Shanghai and Hangzhou will be charged an additional handling fee of 5 yuan per room. All of these decisions have been approved.</p>

We have taken note of this and will urge the detectives to pay special attention and take strict action." The association has sent people to inspect the road and notify the members of that section to pay attention at all times.

However, Zhao was not satisfied with the matchmaking fee of only ten yuan. At about 9 a.m. on the wedding day, Zhao invited his friend Xu Shiying, from Shaoxing, and ten thugs to go to the Xiangsheng Company on Broadway and hire three cars. They drove quickly to Feng's house. Feng's relatives thought they were all coming to congratulate him and have a drink, so they did not suspect anything. After a while, Zhao and Xu told the groom, Feng Chengji, to come outside to talk. Feng saw that it was the matchmaker, so he agreed. Xu Shiying said that the 10 yuan matchmaking fee you gave is too little. Now you have to pay 50 yuan so that you can get married, or we will beat you. They argued endlessly. Han Hegao, a relative of Feng, intervened and offered to pay 20 yuan, but they refused. While they were negotiating, Chinese policeman No. 2681 happened to pass by and asked what was happening. He took Zhao and Xu to the Yangshupu Police Department. Feng Chengji explained what happened to the police chief, who ordered them to be detained pending investigation. The next morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the situation in detail and requested a trial. Then, the groom, Feng Chengji, the bride, Zhou Afeng, and the witness, Han Hegao, all testified. When questioned, the two defendants gave evasive answers.

<p>Yesterday, before the Xinjiang ship, which had sailed from Qingdao to Shanghai, entered Wusongkou, around one o'clock in the morning on the 21st, a woman jumped into the sea. Her companions discovered her suicide note and immediately reported it to the captain, who ordered the ship to reverse in an attempt to rescue her. However, due to the darkness and vastness of the sea, nothing could be done. It has been determined that the</p>
<h3 id="e155">Suicide Victim is Li Wenfang <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Age 24, Cantonese. She worked as a female labor manager at the Provincial Silk Reeling Factory outside Wulinmen in Hangzhou for four years. She fled her home and ended up in Hangzhou because her grandmother forced her to become a concubine. On the train, she met Ms. Wen Ruihua, a student at the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University. Ms. Wen introduced her to Ms. Wei Qiongying, the secretary of the college, who then introduced her to the silk factory. Her monthly salary gradually increased from over twenty yuan to forty or fifty yuan. This time, during the factory's vacation, she took the opportunity to visit Ms. Wen in Nantong. She also had a friend, Ms. Luan Ruizhen, in Yantai who was about to go abroad to France. This friend had invited her to meet several times, so she especially invited Ms. Wen</p>
<h3 id="e156">To Accompany Her to Yantai for a Meeting <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>She traveled from Tongzhou by boat to Pukou and then took the Jinpu Railway to the Jiaoji Railway, arriving in Qingdao on the 18th. However, she changed her plans and did not go to Yantai. On the 19th, she accompanied Ms. Wen on the Xinjiang ship to Shanghai. According to Ms. Wen, the deceased was very happy during the trip and spent money generously, seeking comfort in transportation, lodging, food, and drink. After the fact, it was realized that she had undergone a major change, but no one expected this accident. In the letters left to her friends, she did not mention the cause of her death and instructed Ms. Wen to tell her other friends</p>

<p>To avoid social gossip. During her four years at the silk factory, she worked diligently and never made mistakes, so she was highly trusted by the factory director. She dressed simply and never had a boyfriend. However, because she had no parents and was all alone, she was always sad, even though she could support herself. Therefore, she liked to study Buddhist books and often read newspapers. In her conversations, she often lamented the evils of society and the failure of the nation. On the ship, she told Ms. Wen that it was not easy to be Chinese, nor was it easy to be Japanese. Even if one was born in America, there were other difficulties for Americans. To seek no suffering,</p>

<p>Etc. She did not die four years ago when she was destitute and helpless, but died today when she was self-sufficient and had no economic problems, nor was she heartbroken or disappointed. Judging from her words, she must have been overstimulated by the national crisis, which led to this last resort. The deceased was wearing a gray silk cotton robe, a blue short cloth shirt, a black short skirt, short hair, and gray Chen Jiageng sneakers. It is hoped that if a fisherman at sea finds her body, they can send a message to the Shanghai Jianghai Customs Lukiazui Water Police Station.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Continued Report on the Collision and Sinking of the He'an Ship <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Markers Hung at the Sinking Site</p>
<p>Crew Members Discharged Yesterday with Compensation</p>
<p>Regarding the collision and sinking of the Hetai Company's He'an ship by the Norwegian merchant ship John Grieg Judson near the Guanghua Oil Fire Station in Gaoqiao on the morning of the 20th, yesterday was a Sunday, and the company was closed as usual. Therefore, negotiations will have to wait until today. Out of consideration for the crew members, the company first discharged them yesterday with compensation. The details obtained are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Crew Members Discharged with Compensation <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The ship had a load capacity of 1,100 tons and a crew of sixty-one, including the captain, chief mate, second mate, sailors, stokers, and stewards. After the ship sank, the crew and passengers were rescued by the Customs and the Asia Minor Steamship. The passengers immediately refunded their tickets. Yesterday afternoon, the crew members went to the Huang Yitai Longan Shop on Wai Xian Gua Street to request compensation from the Hetai Steamship Company. Mr. Huang, the manager, sympathized with the crew's plight and generously agreed to pay them not only their salary for this month but also an additional thirty yuan. The crew members expressed their satisfaction. At 6:30 PM, they gathered at the company, where the accountant called their names and distributed the severance pay. It is said that the ship had not been insured beforehand.</p>

<p>The He'an ship had a large hole in its port side, below the waterline, caused by the violent collision. The captain knew there was danger and immediately increased speed, steering towards the shallow waters of Pudong and dropping anchor. Therefore, the ship's condition yesterday remained the same as the day before. The Customs Port Police (i.e., the Water Police Station) dispatched four sampans and several police officers to guard the scene in shifts to prevent thieves. Although the ship sank in shallow water, it was in a key channel for entering and exiting the Huangpu River. To avoid danger, a red flag was hung there during the day, and a white and a green light were hung at night to warn ships to avoid the area.</p>

<h3 id="e168">National Humiliation Week Speech by Mr. Huang Renzhi on My Views on the Future of Sino-Japanese Relations (Continued) <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Third, there is unity. The Chinese population is several times larger than the Japanese, so why are we being invaded by the Japanese? Not only have some old national humiliations not been washed away in recent decades, but new national humiliations are increasing day by day. This is what Mr. Wang Yunwu said, that we Chinese are each a nation unto ourselves. Fourth, it is also what Mr. Wang Yunwu said, that everyone should act and not just talk emptily. We must resolve to act and each first do our duty well, and that is true action. I myself must work even harder, because this is working for the national crisis, and it must not be the same as in times of peace. Everyone's occupation is of course different, so just work hard from your own position. For example, I work at the Vocational Education Society. From now on, I must work doubly hard in my position. Normally I would rest after eight hours, but now and in the future, I must do extra work. Now I want to talk about Mr. Wang Yunwu again. He is the general manager of the Commercial Press. In the eyes of ordinary people, the general manager is like a general, who should be very happy, able to assign everything to others to do, and take leisure and comfort for himself. Why bother to work so hard? But Mr. Wang Yunwu is not like that. After the January 28th Incident, the Commercial Press suffered such huge losses, and yet it was able to recover in just half a year by August. What was the reason? It turns out that it was because Mr. Wang Yunwu was inside. When others wanted to rest, he didn't rest. Even on weekends and holidays, when he should have sought some entertainment, he didn't go. Even when people invited him to banquets and various gatherings, he didn't go. He endured all kinds of pain and led his colleagues to work hard. Where there is a will, there is a way. The Commercial Press was able to recover in half a year. How much we should admire the spirit of Mr. Wang Yunwu. Therefore, starting tomorrow, we should all learn from him, and China will have hope.</p>
<p>It is a pity that today's audience is all ordinary people. If there were some government officials here today, after hearing Mr. Wang Yunwu's spirit of hard work, if those officials were also willing to take responsibility for national affairs and work in this way, revitalizing China would not be difficult at all. What I have said is all old news. Now I will say a few new words, because many gentlemen have already spoken on this topic. I am here today to bring it to a close, and I hope that everyone will keep it in their minds and truly act on it, and not just talk emptily.</p>
<p>The most important thing for China now is to change its attitude towards life. But how to change it? We must first recognize what a person is, because now everyone only sees an "I", and only sees the "small self" and not the "big self". That is, people's concept of themselves is wrong. Usually, people only know that their hands, feet, muscles, and skin are their own, and that is a "small self". We should understand that this is not me, that many people are me, and that all of China is me. Furthermore, there is a soul beyond the physical body. Only when the physical body and the soul are combined is there a true me.</p>
<p>You can see from the newspapers about a recent incident. In the French Concession, there was a barber soliciting business on the roadside. A police officer went up to check his license, and the barber was so frightened that he tried to escape. But the police officer chased after him and kicked him several times, killing him. If this happened in a foreign country, it would be a big problem. Unfortunately, it happened in China. Many people watched the excitement, but few offered help. Therefore, in recent years, I have been greatly stimulated. I once had a friend, Mr. Shen Pengnian, who was riding in a rickshaw on Avenue du Père Froc and was hit by a truck carrying goods. Mr. Shen was thrown more than ten feet from the rickshaw and died instantly. But you can imagine that Avenue du Père Froc is a very busy road, and of course few people saw the accident. But everyone was afraid of trouble and stood by without asking. At that time, a Westerner happened to pass by on his motorcycle. Seeing the truck causing the accident and fleeing, he was dissatisfied, so he chased after it, copied down the license plate number, and testified. Therefore, although Mr. Shen died, it was still possible to negotiate because of the help of the foreigner. Isn't this an extremely painful thing? There was another incident last year when my son saw a police officer beating a rickshaw puller on the road. He went up to copy down the officer's number. When the officer saw my son copying down his number, he started to beat him. My son questioned him, saying that if the rickshaw puller violated the regulations, he could be taken to the police station or punished according to the law. Why beat him like this? The officer not only ignored him but also took my son to the police station. Coincidentally, there was a woman nearby, only in her twenties, but she was very courageous and secretly followed to testify. As a result, the officer was punished, and my son and the woman were released. At that time, I said to my son that this was the right thing to do. Many people who stand by and watch are mistaken in their view of life, thinking that their own body is me, and that the rickshaw puller who is being beaten by the police officer is from Jiangbei and has nothing to do with me. They keep chanting "compatriots" in words, but in reality, they are unrelated. But we should know what the meaning of the word "compatriot" is. We should know that a compatriot is a metaphor for being born from the same womb and being closely related to each other, meaning they are one and the same. Unexpectedly, now great love is only regarded as a slogan. I think that the people of China now see that their compatriots in the Northeast are suffering in deep water and hot fire, while those in the South can be at ease and carefree. If this time Japan was invaded by the Soviet Union to Hokkaido, I am afraid that the whole country would be excited to the point of madness, and would never again be like China, where they are still fighting for power and profit and internal strife continues. What I have said above is about people. Now I want to talk about life, "life" being the opposite of death. Only by not fearing death can one live enough. There are also sayings like "seek life in death" and "escape from death", which means not fearing death. For example, everyone is here listening to a lecture. Suddenly, a bomb comes, but it falls here and has not yet exploded. If everyone has no way and is afraid of death, then after a scramble, the bomb may explode, and will everyone still be able to live? If someone is not afraid of death and is willing to die himself to remove the bomb, then hundreds of people will be able to live. If everyone is unwilling to die and wants to live, they will all perish together. We know that the 19th Route Army last year was not foolish, because they thought that if we died in places like Miaohang and Jiangwan, everyone could survive. So our survival now is bought with the blood of many soldiers last year. We must not forget!</p>
<p>We now, whether we have read books or studied sociology, and have some common sense, should all know that the armies of the past, like holding a white flag to recruit soldiers, saying how much money a month, everyone is unwilling to go, what does it mean, because this is a deception and has no true meaning, now someone to join the volunteer army, is that could have not died, but for the country to die, the nation can survive, it is worth dying, could have not gone to the army, for the nation to fight, can fight for the nation's survival, it is also worth being a soldier,</p>
<p>I have been greatly stimulated recently, and I ask myself that living in peace in the South is truly guilty in my heart, so I hope everyone recognizes "life", the last sentence, nothing more than to change the attitude of life, and from tomorrow onwards, I myself should also change, to not be ashamed of being a part of the nation, from then on, I am willing to share with you all,</p>

<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Zhabei was beaten to a pulp by the Imperial Army, and the flames of the explosions soared into the sky. The Concession foreigners, enjoying themselves with their wives and concubines, ascended to the eighteenth floor to admire the greatest fire in Shanghai's history. This was a scene from the Battle of Shanghai last year.</p>
<p>Yes, in Shanghai, there is "British territory" and "French territory". Although Zhabei has become a "no-man's land", the Japanese soldiers in the Concession dare not act wildly. That's why the Concession is so popular.</p>
<p>These few days, Tianjin and Beijing are somewhat unstable. "Antiques are valuable, the rich are next, and land is light." So, antiques that have been swept away have been transported to the "French territory" of Shanghai for safekeeping. After the antiques were transported, the rich people of Tianjin and Beijing, with their wives and concubines, packing their belongings, took trains or ships to the south. According to reports, various hotels in Shanghai are booming these days, which proves that the Shanghai Concession is truly a "paradise" on earth.</p>
<p>Originally, Shanghai was already crowded with inland officials who were fleeing from soldiers and bandits, plus politicians who had stepped down from power and disappointed soldiers since the twelfth year of the Republic. Although the Concession has been expanding, and the buildings have been built like pavilions, if people from Tianjin and Beijing continue to come to Shanghai to enjoy themselves, "paradise" will inevitably suffer from overcrowding.</p>
<p>The war in North China has a tendency to spread south. Those wealthy gentlemen in North China outside of Tianjin and Beijing, who have not yet been oppressed by domestic soldiers and bandits to come to Shanghai, may join the group of "prospering Shanghai" in the near future. By then, it will be terrible, "paradise" will be squeezed and broken.</p>
<p>The Japanese have already planned for us there. They want to "join hands" with the foreigners living in Shanghai to create a "permanently peaceful" "free city" and expand the Concession to Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhenru, and Zhabei.</p>
<p>Wonderful! Once this matter becomes a reality, Shanghai will not become the "world's largest paradise"? Haha, manage it well, and it will happen soon. Please don't rush, wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Lantern Disaster <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>This time, our Jiading, although a small county, has continuously produced its lanterns. At first, it was the four villages, making noise every night, with gongs and drums beating loudly. People who went out of the city to watch the lanterns were like a tide, and the county magistrate and district chiefs turned a deaf ear and let them run wild! Some people said that they were occupied by Japanese soldiers for more than two months last year, and they were slaves to the county. But after a year, have everyone forgotten this bitter day? Bah! This is called "making fun in hardship." A few ignorant scholars put on Western suits and leather shoes and ran around in the countryside for a week, and then wrote articles complaining about "rural bankruptcy" and "economic decline" and published them in the newspaper to complain for them. It's really like scratching an itch from outside the boot, how can they know how much money they spend on the lanterns with blood and sweat and mud?</p>
<p>Right now, Loutang Town is also doing this job. It is heard that a certain district chief wanted to prohibit it, and he insisted on the matter with his own job, good! Coincidentally, he encountered the lantern-loving gentlemen, so you went to Suzhou to get the costumes, you donated two large loads of candles, and you went to fight with a certain district chief. So the lanterns of Loutang can be regarded as being stimulated. In fact, is the lantern thing really needed locally? Or should it be prohibited? If this question is raised to be resolved, isn't it going to be laughable? Later, the two leaders were indeed taken to the official office to be sued. Unexpectedly, someone was covering the two behind them. You can keep them locked in the detention center, I will send them food to eat, and I will buy them things to use, because of this, the lawsuit is a lawsuit, the lanterns are still being put out. The word "prohibited" has simply been declared bankrupt in the government.</p>
<p>But in the city, the people who agree with the lanterns are also somewhat itchy and unbearable, saying that since the villages can put out lanterns, why should the city prohibit it? So they also started to put out lanterns, calling it "celebrating the victory of the war". Who knows, the sky has wind and clouds, and people have good and bad fortune. Before the lanterns were put out, a tragedy was staged. Several people who took the stage were beaten with their heads broken and bleeding, and they had to go to Kunshan to ask Mr. Min's family for help, and at that time, I don't know how many people gathered at the second gate of the county government and fought with the police. It's really like a full martial arts performance in Jiaxing Prefecture. Finally, tomorrow it will form a state of strike, sparing no effort to make a fuss, almost more powerful than dealing with diplomatic failures, and overthrowing Cao Lu Zhang. The county chamber of commerce held an emergency meeting and proposed six of the most effective protest letters. What a Xu Weizhen county magistrate, calm in attitude, not anxious, and accepted every one of them. Coincidentally, four robbers came to the Qia Tai Egg Bank outside the Rainbow Bridge west of the west gate and robbed more than four hundred yuan in silver dollars. It was eight o'clock in the evening, and the meeting had not yet ended. The people present heard the alarm on the phone and were shocked, and they seemed to realize that the lanterns in the city were not a peaceful thing?</p>

<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, Wuhan was in the period of splitting the Communists, Mr. Wu Zhihui and Mr. Wang Jingwei had occasional differences in political views and had a big ink lawsuit.</p>
<p>Among the many sophisticated and slippery articles, I still remember that Mr. Wu had taught in Tangshan before. And I still remember that he once said these few words to Mr. Wang:</p>
<p>"Now, if we put two military caps on our heads, the national affairs will have a way."</p>
<p>Oh! Because Mr. Wu and Mr. Wang did not wear military caps, the national affairs have no way. It is said that Tangshan has been lost again. No, it's a full retreat. Then, it's probably a new plan. Since Mr. Wu has had a relationship with Tangshan, he should feel the emotion of his homeland. But I don't know if he can still remember that military cap?</p>
<p>Now, the time when all the people of China, whether they are foolish old people or rude teenagers, must wear military caps, if China is still considered a country, it will probably come soon! I earnestly ask Mr. Wu to put on a military cap first and advocate for the world! We should unite to support Mr. Wu's military cap doctrine, and the national crisis can be saved.</p>

<p>These days it has suddenly become very hot, although it is not June, the temperature is already very high, it is very good to use ice cream Dutch water as a heat-relieving drink.</p>
<p>Coming back from the sun-drenched road, I felt a little dizzy in my head. I wanted to do some work, but my body fell onto the bed and I had a good dream and entered dreamland.</p>
<p>Two hours later, a few claps of thunder woke me up from my good dream. I got up and saw that dark clouds had filled the surroundings. I knew it was going to rain heavily. Soon, raindrops like soybeans came flying. At this time, standing at the window and looking at the road, there were many special scenes that could be used as material for writing articles.</p>
<p>A sister-in-law across the street, seeing the raindrops, ran to the balcony to grab the clothes and diapers drying in the window.</p>
<p>The pedestrians on the road were all running for their lives, but the raindrops were too big. Even if you ran two or three steps in the raindrops, your clothes would be soaked.</p>
<p>The rickshaw pullers saw it raining on the way and immediately put up the cloth awnings for the passengers, but none of them brought raincoats themselves, they just ran wildly in the rain, not afraid of the cold rain.</p>
<p>Only the car is the most stable, no matter how thick the raindrops are, it can't hit the car window, it won't make the clothes of the people in the car wet at all.</p>
<p>When a young couple was walking hand in hand, the raindrops suddenly hit them, and they ran quickly to a shop to avoid the rain, but they were afraid of missing the time to watch the movie, a naive prank?</p>
<p>Many women, in small houses, were really too hot to live in, and took their short benches and ran to the alley to cool off, but a burst of rain drove them all back home.</p>
<p>A deafening thunderclap fell from the sky, scaring the lady next door to open her mouth and keep chanting "Amitabha", her psychology only hoped that the black-hearted people would be struck by lightning.</p>
<p>Half an hour of rainstorm passed in haste, the sun still escaped from the dark clouds in the west, the street was the same as just now, except for the road surface covered with rainwater wet situation, pedestrians also restored the hustle and bustle before the storm, the sky is still very hot, but it is still reduced by three points of heat.</p>

<p>Chapter Seven: A Few Words Sever Affection, Close the Door and Weep, One Shoulder Carries Righteousness, Toast Wine and Discuss</p>
<p>When Gui Zhi said this, his voice was hard, and he couldn't say anything. He turned around and went home. After arriving home, it happened that his mother was not at home. He closed the door, lay down on the pit, held a big pillow in both hands, and cried. He didn't know why, he was so sad that he hugged the pillow tightly and just kept crying. After a while, Jiang Min came back from the backyard, and outside the house, he heard Gui Zhi's whimpering. At first, he was taken aback. When he walked into the house, the bedroom door was tightly closed. He pushed it twice, but the door didn't open. Jiang thought, this is strange. In the first month of the year, I have not said anything to him, and no one has offended him, why is he crying like this? So he pounded on the door and said: Hey! Open the door, child, what's wrong with you? When Gui Zhi was crying, he just wanted to cry out in one breath and vent the anger in his chest. As for whether anyone heard it, he didn't consider this. At this time, the two doors were pounding, and he suddenly thought that if he cried so loudly, wouldn't his mother ask for a reason? Now that his mother is here, should he stop crying or not? If he stops, he can stop crying at will, and crying would be unreasonable. If he doesn't stop, closing the two doors tightly and making his mother not know what to do will scare her. He was lying on the pit and couldn't think of a proper idea for a while, but he cried even harder. Jiang pounded on the door and said: What's wrong? What's wrong? Open the door and tell me clearly. As he said, he pounded the door a few times. Seeing that the door could not be opened, he said: You open the door or not, if you don't open the door, I will go to the backyard and ask Company Commander Zhao to come and beat down this door. Gui Zhi heard that Company Commander Zhao was going to be asked to beat down the door, which was related to face. First, he didn't open the door, jumped up on the bed and replied: Are you crazy? Why did you bring outsiders here? Jiang said: You child, you are really crazy, open your mouth and scold people, even scolding me. Gui Zhi didn't say anything more, jumped up and opened the door, then turned around and lay on the pit again, facing the corner of the wall, and didn't say anything. (Seventy-seven)</p>

<p>— Chu</p>
<p>(1) Buying Rice and Cooking</p>
<p>The white rice we eat every day is mostly washed several times during cooking, but if the first-class fine rice is rubbed and washed by hand, the cooked rice will not only be useless to eat, but will also be harmful. Why? When we cook fine rice into cooked rice, we use scientific methods to test its nutritional value, which is very low. That is: (1) White rice has lost vitamins A and B. (2) It lacks protein, especially the amino acids necessary for maintaining life. Because of elimination, the body is fatally struck. (3) The potassium and phosphorus in inorganic salts are increased, while iron, iodine, etc. are washed away. Therefore, when we eat this kind of white rice, we only have calories, and the necessary nutrients for the body and the nutrients necessary for maintaining normal life are insufficient. Moreover, when vitamin B is lacking, the body will feel uncomfortable. We Chinese people, who generally do not have knowledge about eating white rice, often think that eating first-class fine rice is good, and the more rice is washed, the cleaner it is. You must know that fine rice is already lacking in nutrients, and if you desperately rub and wash it, then all the nutrients will be completely lost. Please pay special attention to this point, housewives. Now I will explain in detail the reasons for the loss of nutrients:</p>
<p>(1) Loss of nutrients in fine rice: From unhulled brown rice, after pounding, it becomes fine white rice. The lost ingredients are fat (73.9%), crude fiber (67.3%), ash (41.2%). The phosphoric acid in the ash reduces its composition in proportion to the pounding time. Especially because of prolonged pounding, inorganic salts, proteins, and vitamin A are completely lost. Now health experts advocate brown rice movement, which is for the sake of maintaining the original nutrients.</p>
<p>(2) Loss of nutrients during washing: Ordinary second-class white rice roughly contains vitamin B. If it is washed and rubbed, then vitamin B will also disappear due to its water-soluble nature. Other crude fibers are lost by 76.4%, fat by 61.6%, and ash by 41.8%. Judging from this, the rice we eat every day should not be too fine, and should not be washed too much. Moreover, when washing, do not rub it by hand. Wash it lightly once or twice. If we only eat first-class fine rice and wash the rice five or six times during cooking, then we will develop beriberi in one or two months, and at the same time, our complexion will gradually become withered and yellow.</p>
<p>(2) Testing Drinking Water</p>
<p>In cities with perfect water systems, the water you eat is certainly not dangerous, but in rural areas and places without water systems, most of them are drawn from rivers and wells, so housewives should understand the quality of the water. Now I will introduce a simple method for testing the composition of water quality:</p>
<p>(1) Silver nitrate test method: Fill a glass with drinking water, add five or six drops of silver nitrate solution, and it will turn light white. This water can be used. If the white color becomes turbid and has precipitation, it is dirty water, and it must have excrement and urine mixed in it. This is proof that the water contains salt. However, wells and streams close to the coast also have saline water, and although there is no excrement and urine flowing in, it will also become turbid. Of course, we can determine this by observing the surrounding conditions and the normal properties of the water.</p>
<p>(2) Organic matter test method: Add sulfuric acid and potassium permanganate solution (0.1%) two or three drops to half a cup of water, and the water will heat up and turn purple-red. If the purple-red color does not disappear, it proves that there is no organic matter in the water and it can be drunk. If the purple-red color disappears immediately, add twelve or three drops of the above-mentioned medicine to test, and it is still the same, then it is determined that the water must contain a large amount of decaying matter of animal and plant origin.</p>
<p>(3) Ammonia test method: Add four or five drops of Nessler's reagent to half a cup of water. If there is ammonia in the water, it will turn light yellow or reddish-brown according to the amount. If there is something precipitated in the reddish-brown color, then the water is even more dirty.</p>

<p>▲Telegram to the National Government: The Federation sent a telegram to the National Government opposing Russia's sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which read: "To the esteemed National Government in Nanjing, it has been widely rumored that Soviet Russia will sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan. Furthermore, according to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, a statement by Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov indicates that this matter has become an undeniable fact. The sovereignty of the Chinese Eastern Railway belongs to both China and Russia, as clearly stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Agreement. The Soviet Russian government, without obtaining our country's consent, dares to disregard the great injustice of the world, violate the agreement, and unilaterally sell the railway to the bellicose and brutal Japan. This association swears to oppose this act of contempt for good faith and infringement upon our sovereignty. Therefore, we hereby telegraph to your government, requesting that a strong protest be lodged with Soviet Russia immediately to uphold public opinion and safeguard our sovereignty. The telegram is urgent. The Shanghai Middle School Teachers' Federation bows.</p>
<p>▲Visiting the Russian Envoy Today: The Federation has decided to dispatch three representatives, Li Yongzhong, Shen Zurun, and Liu Zirun, to visit the Russian envoy this morning and present a letter of opinion opposing the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The letter has been translated into Russian and is recorded below: "To Whom It May Concern, It has been widely rumored recently that your government will sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, your Foreign Minister Litvinov has issued a statement indicating that this matter will become a reality. The sovereignty of the Chinese Eastern Railway is stipulated in Article 9, Section 5 of the 1924 Sino-Soviet Agreement as belonging to both the Republic of China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the disposition of the railway cannot be carried out unilaterally by any country without the consent of both China and Russia. This is a legal imperative. Moreover, at a time when China and Russia are seeking friendship, and the people of both countries are looking forward to working together to promote peace in the Far East, your country intends to disregard the great injustice of the world and violate the agreement. This has deeply surprised and saddened our entire country, both government and public. Considering the importance of this matter, this Federation has specially appointed three representatives, Liu Zirun, Shen Zurun, and Li Yongzhong, to visit Your Excellency the Ambassador and convey everything in person. We respectfully request an audience for your convenience."</p>

<h3 id="e182">The Ministry of Education Stipulates Enrollment Methods for Various Universities <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>▲To Be Implemented From the Twenty-Second Academic Year ▲To Cultivate a Majority of Practical Science Talents</p>
<p>In previous years, domestic universities and colleges had no restrictions on the enrollment of new students. The quantitative proportion of students in liberal arts and law, etc., to those in agriculture, engineering, medicine, and science could not be balanced, leading to the contradictory phenomenon of a surplus and shortage of talent. The Ministry of Education yesterday specially stipulated the enrollment methods for various universities and colleges for the twenty-second academic year and issued an order to comply, making fundamental corrections. The original order stated:</p>
<p>"University education is originally intended to research advanced academics and cultivate specialized talents. However, China's millennia-old tradition of valuing literature and neglecting the practical has become deeply ingrained. Scholars have taken this as their orientation, and liberal arts and law, etc., are simpler to establish. Those who run schools often choose the easy path, leading to a focus on the humanities and a neglect of production, forming a contradictory phenomenon of a surplus and shortage of talent. According to the Ministry's statistics for the twentieth academic year, liberal arts students nationwide (i.e., the colleges and departments listed under Category A below) accounted for 70 percent, reaching 23,230 people, while practical science students (i.e., the colleges and departments listed under Category B below) accounted for 30 percent, totaling 9,928 people. This proportion cannot but be regarded as an abnormal development, lacking balance, and urgently needing correction. Now that foreign aggression is increasing daily and the national economy is declining to an extreme, a majority of practical science talents must be cultivated to meet the extraordinary environment and social needs. Since the beginning of this month, the Ministry has repeatedly received directives from the Central Authorities to strictly reform, and orders have already been issued for compliance. As the twenty-second academic year is about to begin, the enrollment of new students in various universities and colleges should be carefully considered and restricted to conform to the purpose of correcting the abnormal development of liberal arts education. The specific enrollment methods for each school and college are stipulated as follows: (1) From this year onward, any university that operates both Category A colleges (Colleges of Literature, Law, Commerce, Education, Arts, etc.) and Category B colleges (Colleges of Science, Agriculture, Medicine, Engineering, etc.) must ensure that the number of new students enrolled in any Category A college, including transfer students, does not exceed the number of new students enrolled in any Category B college. If the number of departments established in Category A colleges differs from the number of departments established in Category B colleges, the average number of new students enrolled in each department of any Category A college must not exceed the average number of new students enrolled in each department of any Category B college.

<p>Yesterday, the Bai Hong Track and Field Team and the McLins held a competition at the China Baseball Field, with outstanding results.

Cheng Jingguan's 200 meters in 23 seconds flat, Chen Ling's high hurdles in 17 seconds, and Dong Jiaxie's 1500 meters in 4 minutes and 35 seconds were all rare achievements. In the field events, Leng Peigen's shot put of 12.11 meters is probably hard to find nationwide and is not far from Liu Hongxiu's national record of 12.24 meters. Also, Leng's discus throw of 36.16 meters is currently the best result in the country, which is truly gratifying. In the overall result, Bai Hong scored 154 points and received a silver cup presented by Mayor Wu. McLins scored 17 points. The results are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e185">The Six Teams of Veteran Soldiers Engaged in a Fierce Battle, Making It Difficult to Distinguish Between People and the Ball (Written by Wang Jianming) <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>▲Chenbao Wins by One Goal, Overjoyed</p>
<p>▲Shishi Wins Over Shishi Bao by Three Goals, Carefree</p>
<p>▲Xinwen and Minbao Make Peace, Courteously</p>
<p>"The sound of bamboo horns could not hold back the timid heart, afraid of being crushed by the fans, I couldn't help but blush." This was the expression of a certain reporter's wife at the scene. Yesterday, being Sunday, the number of fans at the City First Stadium totaled no less than two thousand. First, they formed a human barrier outside the fence, quietly awaiting the debut of the exciting inter-departmental football match between the newspaper editorial departments. The warriors ran back and forth on the soft battlefield, full of vigor. They did not become drenched chickens, nor did they turn into mud Buddhas. Compared to the previous day, the difference was like heaven and earth. The bitterness and joy were also as different as mud and clouds. The details of the three bloody battles are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Chenbao Beats Shenbao 丨 One to Zero <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>▲Escaping a Penalty Kick: Zhang Longhai hugged the ball and entered the field. The entire audience stood in solemn silence. Shenbao, in the south, first launched a northern expedition. Jin Xi, Yao Suifeng, both carried rifles side by side, Zhu Mingxin was blocked and retreated. Qu Yue shouted, and the entire army obeyed orders. Yu Deyuan's feet were like the wind, the fat Qian Hua ran slowly, but fortunately, the young Wang Dexin's kick was inaccurate, and the effort fell short. Before long, Qu Yue wielded the knife and charged straight in. Li Zunyong was unable to turn around in time, and Huang Jiping was at a loss. Xie Hong immediately returned to the court, preparing to save the day. Unexpectedly, he fouled in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. Qu Yue swept the ball away desperately, but Jiang Huaiqing was quick-eyed and quick-handed, and actually maintained his virgin state. However, the commander Sun Daosheng was indeed sweating profusely and repeatedly said "luck, luck".</p>
<p>▲Avoiding the Wolf but Unable to Avoid the Tiger: The Shenbao warriors were greatly encouraged by this and attacked fiercely. Xu Zexiang stood alone at Yanmen Pass, and the limping Hu Zongfan worked even harder to defend the old camp. Yao Suifeng used small money from the very start, picking up the ready-made ball to kick, and Sun Daosheng was unable to do anything about it, gnashing his teeth in anger. Qu Yue saw a flaw and quickly threw a flirtatious glance at Yu Deyuan. The limping horse repeatedly pressed forward, and after Xie Hong's two feet missed, he became timid. He then threw himself forward to meet the ball with his head. Who knew that the ball was no match for the head and turned backwards. Jiang Xiaoguang was waiting in the right place and with a loud bang, Shenbao lost its defense.</p>
<p>▲Wearing a Stone Mortar and Dancing Jiaguan: In the second half, Sun Daosheng summoned the generals to hold a secret military conference. The muddleheaded strategist Ji Zhizhong also entered the field to give advice, whispering in the ears of the generals, "Do this, do that." A melee began, and the momentum indeed increased greatly. Chenbao's rear defense was in a state of chaos. Hu Zongfan blocked the stone frame on the left, Xu Zexiang risked half his life, and Zhou Fuming suffered both his legs. Fortunately, relying on the blessings of his ancestors, no major disaster occurred within the house. Sun Daosheng's precious saber was not old, and his ambition was everything, but he was unfamiliar with his partner, losing many good opportunities. He could only sigh to the sky, "Heaven will destroy me, not a sin of war."</p>

<p>▲Wasting Time in the First Half: The Shishi News, the battle yesterday was drastically changed. Xia Kaiming's little wife was promoted, presided over the Mid-Autumn festival, Yao Tingchun served as Yellow Gate official, veteran Pan Gongbi, and lad Tang Huade, one big and one small, a match between Laurel and Hardy, partner naturally pure and mature, Time newspaper front, there are also changes, Bai Ru of the sheep as Shao Yizhi, the first half is also a sacrifice appearance, kicking two feet Kualashuangcui, nothing to say, Old Teng no sparkle and shine the day before, according to him, had not been adequate rest, so this is why the first half had also spell through two old lives, but Shi News strict defense, Pan Gongbi, steady with everyone's demeanor, little clown dare not jump Liang, Little Summer is more full fly, sad business, it is not easy to have a home.</p>
<p>▲Jiang Xiangqing Roars the Wind and Clouds: After changing sides, Jiang Zongdao personally sounded the war drum. Lao Teng rose up at the right time and launched a major southern expedition. Xia Kaiming's eyes were on the top of his head, Wang Dajun's feet had no spirit, Nie Shiqi shouted from the eastern suburbs, and Cheng Changbin's three passes fell. Jiang Xiangqing fired a cannon from 30 yards away, and the ball was low and fast. Zhang Shengzhi's vision was blocked by the crowd, and he actually let the ball into the net. Jiang Zongdao shouted loudly and ordered a counterattack. Lao Teng had just moved his legs, and Pan Gongbi refused people from a thousand miles away. Jiang Xiangqing and Sun Chuyuan returned the favor, and the transfer of affection was not close. In an instant, they broke into the penalty area, and Cheng Changbin's actions were improper. The case was ironclad, and a penalty kick was ruled. Jiang Xiangqing sent it in gently and again into the red heart.</p>
<p>▲Success with Three Arrows Determines Tianshan: Since Grandma Jiang scored twice in one fell swoop, many old women without children were envious and praised (forward) Teng Shugu was even more happy and amazed, working hard with both legs, full of hope for a boy, to comfort his loneliness. Who knew that midwife Pan Lao would actually come up with a civet cat for a prince, a empty joy. Li Zhuozhen, a girl of sixteen, had a strong spirit. With the help of Lao Jiang, she was actually able to give birth to a big fat son. What kind of muddleheaded account is this? It turned out that the third ball of the Times was lost again. Jiang Zongdao had a patriotic heart, but Fang Jianyun had no way to ask for a battle, and as a result, he was empty-handed and his eyes turned black.</p>

<p>▲ Jiang Jianhou Has Many Tricks - Among the six newspapers, the Jiang family's army is extremely formidable. Jiang Zongyi and his brothers are a match for ten thousand men. The Jiang Xiangqing brothers are "talented in both beauty and artistry, excelling in both singing and acting." In addition, there is the burly Jiang Jianhou, guarding the entrance of the Xinwen Bao, who performed even more impressively yesterday, saving over a dozen dangerous situations. The Minbao's defenders, Wu Zhong's Jiang Hongjiao, are as fierce as tigers and leopards. Shen Meizhen, as slippery as an eel, could not cross the "thunder pond" even a step. Lu Yi Geng sighed in despair. Jiang Zongyi, the "Number Nine Old Gun," suffered a blow to the ribs, circled the field once, and returned to the front lines despite the pain. This achievement deserves a mention in the record of merits.</p>
<p>▲ Jiang Zongyi Lost and Regained - The first half passed in a chaotic scramble, with one side eating a "duck egg" (zero score) and the other side eating a "tangyuan" (zero score). In the second half, both sides intensified their offense and defense. The two generals of Wu Jiang constantly supplied ammunition from the rear, but Zhou Yinyin lost many opportunities due to "fear of failure." Ma Zhishan stuck out his belly and successfully intervened. Chen Tongsheng ventured deep into enemy territory, and Chen Jingshu carelessly committed a handball foul, resulting in a penalty kick. Jiang Zongyi took the penalty, which bounced off Wu Dong's leg. Jiang Zongyi, with "loyalty and righteousness," mustered his strength and passed the ball again to Zhang, resulting in a successful score. Yan Duhe, watching the fire from across the river, happily said to others, "We have scored a goal, we can defend now!"</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Zhen Strives for a Draw - However, Zai Er in the field was anxious and only knew how to advance without retreating. Wu Zhongyi's defense advocated a war-like approach, and Zhao Shukun repeatedly declared the need to recover lost territory. Chen Wanli failed to achieve success, and Fei Shunyuan kept people at a distance. Wang Jiesheng attempted to infiltrate the fortress, and Jiang Hongjiao raised the feet of a scholar without fear of "the emperor's high gate." When the ball was about to go out of bounds, Hu Liangcheng and Kongwo Shangren were in a standoff. The Shangren had many magical treasures, and with a ray of golden light, he broke through the enemy lines. Yin Kebin launched a second counterattack, and at a suitable point, he passed to Zhang Zhen from afar, who powerfully shot at the goal. Jiang Jianhou could not save it in time, and the peace agreement (draw) was finally achieved.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Brief Notes from Our Correspondent with the Army <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>It is said that the six newspaper armies, after meeting and fighting fiercely at the baseball field on the afternoon of the 20th, continued their battle at the Municipal Stadium yesterday. As the clock struck three, the warriors from each newspaper arrived one after another, with a momentum like a mountain collapsing and the sea roaring, immediately arousing the excitement of the audience. The first match, between our newspaper and the Chen Bao, was even more humorous, providing readers with something to smile about. Let the reporter tell it one by one, as an obligation report.</p>
<p>▲ Desertion Before Battle - Seven or eight out of ten of our newspaper's warriors were football veterans in their day. Although this tune had not been played for many years, they still showed the vigor of tigers and dragons when they took the field. Before the battle, they customarily tested their skills. Manager Ma Yinliang, in his blue cloth shoes, also rushed out from the crowd, kicking several balls with all his might, still managing with ease and adding color to the long-robed comrades. Qian Bohan, with his bald head, also tested his skills, showing considerable ability. Both gentlemen regretted that they could not request to join the battle due to regulations. Committee member Zhao Junhao, a football fan, suddenly imitated Zai Yu's strategy and woke up too late, unable to arrive in time, much to his disappointment. Ma Chonggan arrived very early, and Qu Shao Yi sped over in his car. By the time the battle ended, the three gentlemen greatly comforted all the warriors. In terms of the warriors' spirit, it was even more full yesterday. Carrying the remaining force of yesterday's confrontation with Shishi (The Eastern Times), everyone was itching for a fight, their courage increased a hundredfold. Wang Xilian, a burly man who had served as an internal guard, was suddenly put under surveillance by the cabinet and dared not take the field. The crowd deemed it desertion before battle, resulting in a fine of ten jin of wine.</p>
<p>▲ A Winter Melon Appears - As soon as the battle drums sounded, the two armies rushed to compete. The opponents were all young lads with good leg strength. Although our side consisted of veteran soldiers, they were physically strong, tall and short, fat and thin, of all sizes. Qian Hua, the "winter melon" with a large belly (as named by the Da Mei Evening News), attracted the most attention from the audience. Every step and every move caused his entire body to shake, making the viewers burst into laughter.</p>
<p>▲ Behind-the-Scenes Stories - Captain Sun Daosheng skillfully maneuvered the ball on his feet, performing excellently, but unfortunately, he fell to the ground and injured his left hand. Veteran Xie Hong, with his copper skin and iron bones, bravely resisted in every battle, making outstanding contributions. Forward Zhu Mingxin charged through the bloody path, covered in sweat, constantly complaining. Lu Erqiang displayed the true colors of a scholar, but he was as light as a swallow and the fastest on his feet. Jiang Huaiqing saved a penalty kick and returned the favor. Huang Jiping, tall and strong, shot a ball high into the air for five minutes, flipping a back somersault, causing the entire field to burst into laughter. Although our newspaper did not win this match, the united effort and spirit were truly outstanding.</p>

<p>The Dongya Sports Academy in Lujiawan is well-managed and has a long-standing reputation. This year, the affiliated normal school participated in the Shanghai Municipal Middle School Sports Meet and won the men's and women's track and field events and the team championship. The school is required to hold a competitive sports meet once every semester. It is learned that the track and field individual sports meet will be held at the China Athletic Field today and tomorrow. All students of the school, regardless of gender, must participate. Those who do not join without a good reason will not be promoted or graduate. Their attention to popularization is a model for those who pay attention to unbalanced development. It is also heard that in order to promote sports, no admission tickets will be issued, so that all interested people can go to visit. In addition to track and field individual competitions, there are also track and field equipment, basketball, football, volleyball, baseball, and tennis inter-class championships, all of which will be held at the school.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Recent News from Southeast Women's Physical Education School <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The Southeast Women's Physical Education School in Jiangwan has 36 graduating students (12th class) including Feng Heguang, etc., who organized a visiting group to observe other schools for reference purposes. Originally, they planned to visit Nanjing, Wuxi, and Suzhou, but after the visit, due to the Shanghai Municipal Government's fundraising event for the Aviation National Salvation Boy Scouts, the entire school participated in fundraising, so it could not be achieved. Recently, the group changed its plan to go west and instead visited various schools in the city. Therefore, on the 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th of this month, they visited Jiaotong University, Nanyang Middle School, Shanghai Middle School, and the Shanghai Municipal Council Girls' School, Wuben Girls' School, and Wanzhu Primary School, which were quite busy every day.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the school authorities and faculty members, in order to promote sports and provide supplementary education for a group of primary and secondary school physical education teachers, plan to establish a summer sports supplementary class during this summer vacation. It is heard that the class plan is limited to five weeks, and the courses are based on an elective system. The detailed regulations are being drafted and will be published in the newspaper soon to inform everyone far and wide.</p>

<p>The Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Teachers' School held a group sports meeting at the China Baseball Field yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Around 1:00 PM, the Father Luo Shenfu Road was crowded with spectators arriving one after another. The group sports performance included 23 sections, among which the most outstanding exercises were the overall flexibility exercises, the graceful exercises of the 14th and 15th classes, and the stick exercises of the 14th class, all with agile movements and skilled steps. The "Emei" folk dance of the 15th and 16th classes depicted the joys of rural life everywhere, portraying the subtle details. When the four-door diaofu of the 14th class entered the field, the guests immediately joked, "The broadsword team is here!" For a moment, the dazzling light flashed, dancing across the entire field, and the healthy and beautiful students instantly transformed into resolute warriors. Graduates of the school participated in the guest performance, including schools such as Minli, Chengdong, Minzhi, Xuhui Attached Primary School, and Xiaoming, all of which were very impressive. The "Little Treasures" section of the Xuhui Attached Primary School was particularly lively and delightful, earning endless praise. The last item was military training. For each program that appeared, the Shanghai Garrison Command military band played music to add to the fun. Commander Dai presented a silver cup to reward the winning group. There were a total of 15,000 guests in addition to the scouts from the Lujiawan Police Station, the Shanghai YMCA Middle School, and the Huizhong Middle School, who maintained order at the venue.</p>

<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Business Conditions</p>
<p>Section 3: Quack Doctors and Fake Medicines</p>
<p>The term "quack doctor" should not, in principle, be a specialized term. However, in the current reality of Shanghai, unfortunately, there are many people who treat patients who neither base their practice on traditional medicine nor possess genuine knowledge of modern medicine. They can only be reluctantly called "quack doctors." In certain societies, quack doctors take advantage of shallow public knowledge and economic decline to practice so-called "jianghu" (roving) techniques, allowing their businesses to flourish. Five or six years ago, there were already "trauma and dental doctors" who pushed large carts with cloth canopies, also "selling" so-called German Lion Brand 914, etc. However, they are now outdated because social understanding is also progressing, albeit superficially. Therefore, current quack doctors have rented suitable premises in bustling areas, installed bright red electric lights, and set up small exhibitions of venereal disease specimens along the roadside, posting large advertisements in newspapers filled with old and new medical terms and charitable slogans. Thus, their business has gradually infiltrated the middle and upper classes from the lowest levels of society. The prices they charge have also gradually increased due to the patronage of the middle and upper classes. From swindling for food to wanting to get rich is also an inevitable trend of human nature. However, medicines are ultimately tools for treating diseases, and diagnosis is the knowledge of doctors. Quack doctors can advertise things like "Olenmei needle, one yuan each" or "Aerti gong, seven jiao each" in newspapers. Then why can't Feng Cunren and Qing Yu Tang also advertise loudly, saying "Xiaochuan lian, two jiao and a half per qian" or "Jinwen rhubarb, three jiao and a half per liang," and use this as a slogan for solving social and economic medical problems? This ridiculous spectacle not only fails to elicit correction from society but is even sympathized with by some gentry. The state of affairs in China is therefore predictable. In the old days of conservatism, weapons were only spears and halberds, which everyone could own. Now, guns and cannons are sharp and dangerous, so people are not allowed to privately possess firearms. However, letting new chemical products fall into the hands of the unlearned and unskilled is probably more likely to kill than to save. Moreover, when new drugs kill, there is no proof of wrongdoing. The ignorant authorities still adhere to ancient versions of "The Washing Away of Wrongs." (I once saw a lawyer write an article strongly refuting forensic autopsies and advocating "The Washing Away of Wrongs.") Even if a lawsuit is filed, it is impossible to find a suitable charge. Why do government authorities only know how to ban firearms and not know how to regulate the use of drugs?</p>
<p>Once, I was blamed by a friend for saying that the prosperity of modern medicine and the proliferation of Western drugs have created so many strange phenomena and that we should bear some responsibility for correcting them. So, my first step was to blame Western merchants for supplying drugs to quack doctors. However, the Western merchant replied well. He said that your country has many kinds of "healing craftsmen," and it is not known which ones should buy our medicines and which ones should not. There are no clear regulations to date. We are people of a rule-of-law country, and without legal basis, we cannot be held responsible for others! I had to retreat in silence.</p>
<p>In the pharmaceutical world...the opposite of quack doctors are fake medicines. The source of fake medicines can be said to be Shanghai. According to newspapers, there are not only so-called "scientific methods" and "carefully researched products," but also famous mountains and rivers in the inland, and various magical herbs, all of which are transported to Shanghai to save people. It can be considered a great blessing for Shanghai residents that the place of origin is not as important as the place of gathering. But then again, what kind of grass root or tree bark cannot be used as medicine? There is no such thing as genuine or fake in itself. But if the actual effect is too far from the advertising and the substance is greatly contrary to the theory, then it is a fake product. The production of fake products can be divided into two types. One is a single-recipe herbal remedy without efficacy statistics, and the other is a speculative product that uses excuses to collect money. The former is less harmful, while the latter is intentional and despicable. Since the discovery of "San Na Xing that mistreats tuberculosis" and "Wuliang Shou that is neither donkey nor horse (saying that electricity is added to ginseng, etc.)" last year, I feel that San Na Xing is enough to delay the early treatment of tuberculosis, and Wuliang Shou is misleading and manipulating people's minds by playing with academic theories. Therefore, I once wrote an article in the Social Medical Journal severely criticizing their absurdities. However, as a result, the two companies filed lawsuits against me, accusing me of damaging their reputation. Finally, after a real drug test and research, it was proved that they were all kinds of fallacies, and this case gradually subsided.</p>

<p>— Ji Jilin</p>
<p>Yongjia has been opened as a commercial port since the late Qing Dynasty, and it has been more than sixty years now. In this era of increasingly advanced society, relying on the driving force of nature and human beings, all phenomena, such as politics, economy, and education, have made considerable progress. The scientific new medical cause is naturally no exception. Recently, in the vigorous new medical circle, an exciting and sensational event has occurred. The occurrence of this event has a great impact on society and has contributed a lot to the new medical circle. The fact is this.</p>
<p>Yu Ziwei was a pioneer in the medical circles of Japan. He was the father of Professor Yu Desun of Hangzhou Medical and Pharmaceutical College. Mr. Yu had in-depth research in both Chinese and Western medicine, and was particularly proficient in anatomy. He spared no effort in encouraging younger generations. Last year, he suffered from stomach cancer. Knowing that he would not recover, he left a will to dissect his body.</p>
<p>Death is the last stage of life, which no one can avoid. If viewed from a philosophical perspective, it is a very ordinary thing. Moreover, corpse dissection has long been "commonplace" in Europe and the United States. However, in this aimless Chinese society, especially in Yongjia, when people have not yet recognized the true value of scientific medicine, Mr. Yu's ability to set an example and advocate dissection is therefore considered a meaningful and commendable thing.</p>
<p>Dissection has been practiced in ancient China. According to ancient books, the Book of Documents records "removing the fetus from a pregnant woman" and "cutting off the legs of those who wade in the morning, and dissecting the hearts of virtuous people." The Book of Han records the biography of Wang Mang, saying that "Zhai Yi's party, Wang Sunqing, was captured. Mang ordered the chief physician Shangfang and Kao Tu to dissect him together, measuring his five viscera, and guiding his meridians with bamboo mats to know their end." But this was driven by a kind of curiosity, making occasional observations, without any medical significance. As for dissection for the purpose of medical research, it already existed in the Yellow Emperor's era. The anatomical knowledge recorded in the Inner Canon and Ling Shu chapters all came from "dissection and observation." Unfortunately, the dissection at that time was simple, so many ancient Chinese medical books contain erroneous anatomical knowledge. Even the Classic of Difficulties, written by Bian Que, who was revered as a medical saint in later generations, is not exempt. For example, the Classic of Difficulties records that "the lungs weigh three catties and three liang, with six lobes and two ears, totaling eight lobes," and "the heart weighs twelve liang, with seven holes and three hairs in the middle, holding three he of essence and sweat," etc., which are completely derived from conjecture. However, this is not to blame the ancients, because science was not developed thousands of years ago, so it is certainly impossible to be as precise as it is today. It is only a pity that later generations of doctors did not continue to study and verify, and the errors in ancient books are still regarded as golden rules and cannot be corrected. Even more so, they have become increasingly exaggerated, causing this erroneous anatomical knowledge to spread among the people. This time, when Mr. Yu's body was dissected, representatives of various legal groups and the public were notified separately to observe publicly, fundamentally correcting the public's misconceptions about anatomy. Medicine is one of science, and its foundation is built on anatomy. Therefore, the public's correct understanding of anatomy is the beginning of understanding scientific medicine.</p>
<p>Countries famous for medicine in the world all attach great importance to anatomy. For example, the Institute of Anatomy at the University of Berlin in Germany was established in 1713 AD. Hundreds of corpses are placed in the practice room for students to study. Since the reform of our country, the new medical cause has also shown a prosperous atmosphere. However, anatomy is still rare. Medical schools, except for national and public schools, can extract prisoners or death row inmates from prisons with government assistance for dissection. As for private medical schools, they can only run wildly among the villages and wild graves, seeking exposed bones as practice materials. The reason why there are not many corpse dissections in our country is not because there is a lack of experienced pathological anatomy experts, but because of the opposition of the people. The public is influenced by the ancient訓of "the body, hair, and skin are received from the parents, and dare not be damaged," believing that if a person dies and allows his abdomen to be cut open and his limbs broken, he is a great sinner in Confucianism and is despised by mankind. I remember that more than ten years ago, it was reported that a doctor (whose surname is forgotten) dissected the body of his uncle, which aroused public attack and involved legal proceedings. It shows the importance that the Chinese people attach to corpses. This time, Mr. Yu's body dissection broke the public's outdated psychology and made them understand the true meaning of dissection. The significance is so great.</p>
<p>All human beings always hope that the doctor has an accurate diagnosis, because the outcome of the disease is closely related to the diagnosis. Therefore, the most important thing for doctors with rich knowledge and experience is to identify the type of disease, observe the changes in the condition, and then make an accurate diagnosis before determining the appropriate and rational treatment. Unfortunately, when encountering difficult to diagnose and life-threatening diseases, one doctor diagnoses it as disease A, and another doctor diagnoses it as disease B. When there are conflicting opinions, it is impossible to reach a conclusion. Without relying on corpse dissection, it is impossible to know where the disease is and what the disease is. For example, Mr. Yu suffered from stomach cancer. After understanding the dissection, I felt the precision of the new medical diagnosis. Let the public know the true face of new medicine. Mr. Yu really died with extra merit.</p>
<p>I, forgetting my shallowness, have said some of the above words. Perhaps it can arouse the attention of the people and jointly advocate corpse dissection. I hope even more that my colleagues in the new medical circle will embrace the same aspirations as Mr. Yu and set an example, so that the new medicine will be popularized to the great China as soon as possible. Mr. Yu, if he knows, will also smile in the ground.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Recent Preventive Medicine <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Ge</p>
<p>The Difference Between Preventive Medicine and Hygiene: Preventive medicine and hygiene seem to be the same, but they are actually two different disciplines. Hygiene is the method of teaching individuals or groups to avoid disease or death. Preventive medicine refers to all possible methods of directly maintaining health. For example, avoiding sewage and bad food to avoid typhoid fever, and avoiding things that weaken the body. This belongs to hygiene. As for injecting typhoid vaccine, that belongs to the scope of preventive medicine.</p>
<p>Hygiene is something that we humans have been able to pay attention to since ancient times. For example, there are many precepts in religion regarding food and drink, which are actually hygienic methods. And not only humans have hygiene, but also the livestock and garden plants we see around us. For example, cattle and horses can distinguish harmful grass and do not bite it. The direction of plant growth has light avoidance, dark avoidance, humidity aversion, and dryness avoidance. These are all their hygiene rules. Therefore, personal hygiene is not unique to humans. On the contrary, preventive medicine is only available to humans. Animals do not have a positive behavior to prevent disease or physical weakness. Therefore, preventive medicine is a phenomenon unique to humans, who are called "the spirit of all things," and it is also a symbol of cultural progress.</p>
<p>Achievements of Preventive Medicine Practitioners: Preventive medicine also had its beginnings in ancient times. For example, primitive aborigines used antidotes to avoid the danger of poisonous arrows, or to weaken the toxicity. Aborigines also gradually increased the amount of toxins absorbed to avoid the harm of arsenic and increase the body's resistance. These can all be regarded as a method of preventive medicine.</p>
<p>Jenner: It was not until modern times that there was preventive inoculation against smallpox. The English Jenner discovered this method through experience. In 1798, Jenner made it practical through experimentation. This great discovery is the first glorious page in the history of preventive medicine. At that time, people could not understand the reason for vaccination and its actual benefits. It was not until a hundred years later that the world knew it. Later, Pasteur in France and others in the Jenner lineage made more discoveries. Pasteur first discovered preventive inoculation against rabies in preventive medicine. This discovery was made by Pasteur, Beylen, and Luo in 1885. The method is also very effective. Like vaccination, it is still used today without any changes. Those who suffer from the disease are all blessed by it.</p>
<p>The above two are good examples of preventive medicine. In recent years, the development of preventive medicine has been based on hygiene bacteriology. The prevention of infectious diseases has been increasingly successful.</p>
<p>Ramen: In the second and third years, the preventive injection of diphtheria was also completed. As generally known, children are prone to this disease from the age of one to six. The treatment of this disease is most effective with serum therapy. This was invented by Bering and Kitazato forty years ago. However, in recent years, Dr. Ramen, the head of the serum department of the Pasteur Institute in France, worked hard on serum production during the European War. He accidentally noticed a precious phenomenon in the test tube. After the war, he began to study it. In 1922, he discovered a new phenomenon based on the interaction between toxin and antitoxin. Soon, he used this new phenomenon as a basis and discovered the complete prevention method of diphtheria. The method he invented is to add one liter of newly filtered and highly potent diphtheria toxin to four milliliters of formaldehyde and place it in a 38-degree incubator.</p>

<p>for one month. The originally powerful toxin becomes a harmless substance to the human body and can be completely immunized because it produces specific antitoxins. This substance is named diphtheria immunogen. Take a very small amount of it and inject it subcutaneously three or two times every one or two weeks, which can make us completely immune to the actual diphtheria. The immunity is effective for about five years. In this way, young children can be completely freed from the threat of diphtheria bacteria. The reduction in the incidence rate is very significant. Now all countries are eager to implement it. Italy has even issued an edict regarding this matter. In areas where diphtheria is prevalent, children aged one to five must be injected with this agent.

<h3 id="e197">The Question of the Duration of Pregnancy... Reply to Mr. Wang Ping... <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Shaoheng</p>
<p>In reply. Shaoheng previously went to Ping for business. I just returned to Shanghai yesterday. I received your esteemed letter with respect. The issue you discussed regarding the duration of pregnancy has myths in both the East and the West since ancient times. However, considering today's scientific obstetrics, it inevitably becomes a laughingstock. Nevertheless, the best basis is facts. Often, what the world deems impossible may indeed exist. It is not impossible to create a new record in obstetrics. According to this matter, there are significant differences in civil law. Therefore, most European and American countries have explicit regulations. It is a pity that our country still lacks them. The regulations of various countries listed in my book "Lectures on Obstetrics" are based on the civil laws before 1928. Whether there have been any changes since then, I have not had time to verify. Therefore, the duration of pregnancy also follows the records of famous books by medical pioneers in various countries. I dare not make any arbitrary or unfounded claims. Your friend's wife has had doubts because the duration of both pregnancies exceeded the normal range. In my opinion, this is quite valuable for research. However, the most exceptional case known to Shaoheng, as mentioned by Zongemeister, is only 355 days. However, because it is not commonly seen in various books, it was not adopted. Besides that, there is no factual record to rely on, and there is a lack of previous cases. I dare not deceive the world with frivolity. Your letter mentioned that the duration of pregnancy can exceptionally extend to fifteen or sixteen months. Shaoheng is shallow and ignorant and is willing to accept guidance. Could you please provide the book title so that I can increase my knowledge? I am deeply grateful. Respectfully replying.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Appendix: Letter from Mr. Wang <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Great Physician Shaoheng,</p>
<p>I recently read your book "Lectures on Obstetrics" (1928 edition) at a friend's house. I admire it immensely. However, the section on the duration of pregnancy still does not resolve my doubts. I am specifically asking for your expert guidance. I hope you will take the trouble to answer. A friend of mine says that his wife is very virtuous. They have been married for eight years and have two children. (She reportedly still has menstruation during pregnancy.) The first child was born fifteen months after my friend left home. The second child was born twelve months after he left home. Considering the prescribed days of pregnancy, his wife must be unchaste. However, after consulting other books, the duration of pregnancy can exceptionally extend to fifteen or sixteen months. Your book does not mention this. It also says that according to British regulations, the longest is only 320 days. (The number does not match the original book. Shaoheng's note) Is there any exceptional extension of the duration of pregnancy? I hope to receive a reply. Also, has our country's civil law recently stipulated anything in this regard? Please also inform me. Respectfully wishing you good health.</p>

<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>(10) (4) Management of Postpartum Hemorrhage</p>
<p>(A) Normal Bleeding and Abnormal Bleeding</p>
<p>Normal bleeding occurs twice, once before and once after delivery. The first time is when labor is imminent. The mucus discharged is mixed with thin blood. The second time is after the expulsion of the afterbirth, due to the separation of the placenta, there is slightly more bleeding. This kind of bleeding naturally stops after the placenta and membranes are completely separated, because the broken blood vessel openings are sealed by the contraction force of the uterus. Otherwise, if the uterine contraction is poor, and the broken openings cannot be completely closed, bleeding will continue, leading to life-threatening danger.</p>
<p>In short, the amount of bleeding during normal delivery varies from woman to woman, but at least 200 grams to at most 600 grams. If it exceeds this amount, it is abnormal bleeding.</p>
<p>(B) Causes of Abnormal Bleeding</p>
<p>The main symptom of placenta previa is bleeding. Placenta previa can be marginal, lateral, or central. Bleeding due to placenta previa generally occurs suddenly without external inducement. The timing of occurrence can be determined by the location of the placenta attachment. Marginal bleeding is the latest, mostly at the beginning of the tenth month of pregnancy. The second is lateral, bleeding occurs earlier, around the ninth month of pregnancy. Central bleeding is the earliest, mostly occurring in the seventh month of pregnancy.</p>
<p>Bleeding from placenta previa can be small or large, varying in amount. It may be a large amount at the initial occurrence, or it may be small at first and then increase, eventually leading to anemia, or even death.</p>
<p>Abnormal bleeding is also the main sign of premature placental abruption. Why does premature placental abruption occur? It is mostly due to the mother suffering from endometritis, or pregnancy-induced nephritis, strenuous physical activity, abdominal contusions, tough membranes, or membranes that are not easily ruptured, leading to internal and external bleeding. The internally shed blood accumulates between the uterine wall and the detached placenta and membranes. The bleeding is not seen externally. If the blood flows out externally, the symptoms are no different from internal bleeding. After internal and external bleeding occurs, the lower abdomen suddenly experiences severe pain, the uterus enlarges and becomes very tense, labor pains stop, the pulse becomes rapid and weak, breathing becomes difficult, the limbs become cold, consciousness becomes blurred, the face becomes pale, cold sweat breaks out, the vision becomes blurred, and the ears ring, or even leading to acute anemia and death.</p>
<p>(C) Treatment of Abnormal Bleeding</p>
<p>After abnormal bleeding is discovered, a doctor should be consulted immediately for treatment. However, as an emergency measure, an ice pack can be placed on the lower abdomen. The patient should lie down with her head low and legs high. Bleeding wounds are most susceptible to mold invasion. Before the doctor sutures the wound, special attention should be paid to cleanliness.</p>
<p>If the bleeding from placenta previa is mild, rest quietly. If the bleeding is severe, perform vaginal tamponade, artificial rupture of membranes, foot breech extraction, uterine dilation, and other procedures. When there is high-grade bleeding in premature placental abruption, removal of the uterine contents is the best strategy. When necessary, vaginal dilation, vaginal tamponade, amniocentesis, and one of the procedures such as forceps craniotomy and fetal reduction should be performed. If a hematoma occurs in the vagina, a cloth soaked in 1% Lysol can be used to apply pressure. If it has ruptured, use a compression bandage.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Talks on Heliotherapy <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>Heliotherapy is the method of using sunlight to improve human health or treat diseases. Its effectiveness is mostly due to the ultraviolet rays contained in sunlight. Therefore, heliotherapy must be carried out under sunlight with sufficient ultraviolet rays to be legitimate. However, the ultraviolet rays emitted from sunlight are easily absorbed by coal smoke, dust, and water vapor in the air. At the same time, they can also be absorbed by the air. Therefore, sunbathing is most effective far away from cities, in high altitudes with thin air. However, on the plains, wherever there is direct sunlight, sunbathing will have considerable effects.</p>
<p>Effects</p>
<p>Sunbathing is effective for all weak constitutions and all chronic diseases. It is especially effective for chronic tuberculous diseases, such as tuberculosis, pleura, peritoneal tuberculosis, kidney, bladder, genital tuberculosis, bone and joint tuberculosis, skin tuberculosis, and so on.</p>
<p>Generally, for tuberculous diseases, quiet therapy is adopted. For example, for tuberculosis, the patient is made to lie down quietly. For joint tuberculosis, plaster bandages are used to fix the affected area so that it can be fully quiet. The goal is to use the body's inherent resistance to resist pathogens and parasites and to use the immunity generated by the body's natural reactions to wait for the recovery of the diseased body.</p>
<p>Heliotherapy is a more proactive method. Sunlight is directly shone on the skin and affected area (when there are wounds) of the whole body to stimulate the body, increase its resistance, and promote the occurrence of immunity. If the body is too weak, there may be danger when sunbathing. It should be carried out under the guidance of a doctor.</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>For heliotherapy, "first," the entire spectrum of sunlight must be used. If it is in a glass shed, the outer line is absorbed by the glass, which is ineffective. It must be performed directly under sunlight. "Second," heliotherapy must be gradual. Do not rush it to avoid failure. On the first day, only expose the feet (from heel to toe) for five minutes. On the second day, expose the lower legs (from knee to heel) for five minutes, and expose the feet for ten minutes. On the third day, expose the upper legs for five minutes, expose the lower legs for ten minutes, and expose the feet for fifteen minutes. In this way, the area exposed to direct sunlight is gradually expanded and the time is increased daily, until it reaches the entire body. "Third," sunbathing must be in direct contact with sunlight. Wearing clothes towards the sun cannot be called sunbathing. After sunbathing, the spirit is extremely refreshed, just like the pleasure gained after exercise. If appetite increases, one can sleep soundly and resistance is increased. The affected area also tends to heal more easily. The effectiveness is indeed not insignificant.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Writing Books and Teaching <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Dafu</p>
<p>Writers and teachers both walk the same path concerning books, but these two professions are absolutely incompatible. This is a fact that those who have not personally experienced it cannot understand. People generally think that teaching can lead to writing a book using the teaching materials. And a writer, before finishing his book, can use the collected materials to teach. These two things are one and two, two and one, the easiest and simplest things. But little do they know that the joys and hardships involved are far beyond what ordinary people can imagine.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the purpose of writing and teaching. The main purpose of both is, of course, the same: to spread knowledge and create culture. Secondly, the secondary purpose is, of course, something that no one can avoid: to make a living. That's right, the purpose of writers and teachers is exactly the same. But if people think that these two things are one and the same just because their purposes are the same, then they are wrong. Because the processes involved in achieving these purposes are very different.</p>
<p>First, there is a big difference between the audience or listeners (The Audience) and the readers (The Reading Public). The readership of a writer has no restrictions on time, place, age, knowledge, class, occupation, etc., while the audience of a teacher is generally subject to the various restrictions mentioned above. Also, the readership of a writer rarely meets the writer, while the audience of a teacher is facing living and breathing people. Just from this point alone, we can feel how free the writer is and how much the teacher is bound! Therefore, many people with good knowledge often cannot speak when they stand on the podium; while many people with strong eloquence can speak fluently even without real knowledge, making listeners admire them.</p>
<p>Second, there is the psychological change between the writer and the teacher: Because the writer enjoys the many freedoms mentioned above, his entire mind can focus on the writing itself. He doesn't mind being meticulous, he's not afraid of being profound, he polishes and refines his work until he feels satisfied, and then he publishes it. And the teacher, because the person sitting there listening attentively is a feeling-filled animal called a "human," he has no choice but to be dominated by the feelings of the audience, depending on the time and place. Once emotions move, the line of thought will be scattered. Not to mention the speaker's own emotions, just the reaction caused by the audience's emotions reflecting into the speaker's heart is enough to make it difficult for the teacher to have complete confidence. What's more, modern youths are rebellious creatures!</p>
<p>Third, there is the conflict between reason and emotion. Those who engage in creative literature (Creative Literature) or creation should absolutely not teach; because creators must be based on emotion, while teachers emphasize reason. The extension and cultivation of reason can often kill emotion, and the emotional heat wave can also easily disrupt reason. Therefore, a great poet may become the worst professor of poetry when asked to teach poetry. The reading of a poet is sometimes far inferior to the rehearsal (Rehearsal) of a third-rate actor. However, China has a bad habit of often inviting creators to teach or lecture. This is a thing that has a hundred harms and no benefits. It is a minor matter if the audience is disappointed for a moment and regrets being deceived. But if the creator loses his inspiration and poetry forever due to temporary constraints, that is a great loss to the nation! May 20, 1933</p>
<h3 id="e202">Interrupted Reunion <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Jinming</p>
<p>The soft green of Beihai Park spread among all the branches and leaves in a gentle and warm breeze. Boats were rocking back and forth on the waves, along with old and new aquatic plants, cormorants and wild ducks.</p>
<p>I often go alone to that secluded corner to find a seat because I am looking for a little "quiet". At the north end of the park, there are three glass pavilions connected together, facing the water and backing onto a series of earthen rocks. Among the chaotic tourists, one can still find the nature that is not submerged.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the park is like the stock market's opening. Those who come to the park in the morning must be lonely people left over from the world, or those who come to seek some relief. Touring during the opening seems to have other functions. People seem to think that way.</p>
<p>Sitting in that glass pavilion - the one facing east - it has been half an hour; the Longjing tea is not genuine, but it is light enough. I have to use strong cigarettes to stimulate myself. People who live in big cities and lead lives full of intense stimuli crave things that are as light as water. But when they try it, they feel some regret. My vision scatters into the gaps, but it is soon reined in by the questions called out in my mind. Only the air is fresh, making my lungs feel refreshed.</p>
<p>"Hey, hurry up! Add three seats."</p>
<p>This abrupt voice made me turn my head to look at a patron behind me - young but showing signs of aging, trying hard to decorate himself luxuriously on an unsuitable body - with an agitated face. His companion, someone who looked like him, stood waiting for something.</p>
<p>Their guests were two women and a boy in a gown about sixteen or seventeen years old. They bowed to the host with unusual restraint. They were all slender and plump, with dull expressions. Naturally, they were already at the end of "Youth Bridge". The lost joy had left a sad shadow on their pale faces.</p>
<p>They sat down around the tea table. It seemed that everyone knew everyone else. Each person was measuring the emotions brought about by this moment. Then came humility and polite greetings. And the opening words were nothing more than admiration, coming from an attitude that did not necessarily have to be sincere.</p>
<p>"Ms. R… Your English at N University, everyone knows that you are the best…"</p>
<p>The host, the young man in the green woolen coat, said in his speech.</p>
<p>There was not much sincere reaction; the taller one only smiled modestly.</p>
<p>"You're too kind."</p>
<p>Humility is naturally a way to express status and "style", and in front of the public, they are talking about things they don't want to talk about, and smiling smiles they don't want to smile. Precisely because between men and women, the eyes of others are sharp and unkind.</p>
<p>The young man in the green woolen coat steered the conversation back.</p>
<p>"Do you know Mr. Song, Ms. R…?"</p>
<p>"Maybe, I don't remember clearly."</p>
<p>The speaker raised her teacup and looked at her partner. Perhaps as a result of being overly cautious, she felt that the other party's casual tone contained ulterior motives. So she was perplexed - a little perplexed - and sought to correct herself.</p>
<p>The boy who came with the two ladies was quiet, looking out the window, like a supervisor who didn't care about anything, never opening his mouth.</p>
<p>"He is Tong Youxin, the director of studies at Huazhong Middle School."</p>
<p>"Ah!" the woman said, "It seems I don't know him very well."</p>
<p>The host's companion, the young man in the hemp coat, seemed to be lowering his head and faking a smile because his face was too dark. There seemed to be a strange and disgusting emotion pressing in his throat.</p>
<p>"Youxin, he also knows that Ms. R's English is very, very good. He often expresses his admiration to others!"</p>
<p>The host was still saying such meaningless things.</p>
<p>The woman was just being polite as usual. Her companion, who seemed to be her sister, had a mocking smile, glancing at the young man in the hemp coat from time to time.</p>
<p>"At the same time, I feel something about Tong… He thinks… because the school needs teachers, so he expressed his interest to me…"</p>
<p>"Oh, is that so?" the woman said.</p>
<p>"He is wondering if Ms. R can teach some classes there?"</p>
<p>The woman's words softened a bit, saying:</p>
<p>"Don't be so polite. You're really too kind."</p>
<p>The people at the table felt uncomfortable. They murmured among themselves; they paid close attention to the changes in psychology in their conversation…</p>
<p>"Teaching is naturally not a matter of being polite…"</p>
<p>The host said this way.</p>
<p>The younger of the two women spoke some dialect to the boy who came with her. The boy stood up immediately and expressed his intention to the host - to leave. It seemed that whether they were asked to stay or not, a cup of tea and a few polite words were already very thin gestures of friendship… so he left his seat and rejected all inducements to talk.</p>
<p>They bowed deeply to the two young men, and with their eyes looking straight ahead, they left with style - this was naturally the result of decades of education - or walked away gracefully.</p>
<p>The people at the table were dissatisfied and unhappy, because they sensed that these two young men would fail to be selected. They are not beautiful, and they are too restrained. What's the use of talking about civilized things?</p>
<p>The two young men, however, were highly skilled at concealing their feelings - naturally, those who are used to concealing their feelings cannot obtain extraordinary experiences - and said this:</p>
<p>"If we had known that they wouldn't teach, why did we invite them?"</p>
<p>"I thought so too."</p>
<p>"I think we should still look for Li Renwu."</p>
<p>"Naturally."</p>
<p>And so they left, handsome and carefree!</p>

<p>— Zizhan</p>
<p>(32) Evidence from a Poem</p>
<p>In my previous discussion of the Tang Caichang case, I cited Zhang Taiyan's article "The Morality of Revolution" as evidence, saying that Long Zehou "led Wen Tingshi to Wuchang to start the affair." Soon after, I received a letter from Mr. Wen Gongzhi, refuting the accusation against his esteemed father. His words were very credible, roughly saying, "After my late father retired from office, he traveled between Shanghai and Guangdong. He went to Japan because he was implicated in the reform movement. He did not return until 1901. How could he have gone to Hubei? My late father was the initiator of the Society for National Strengthening. The society was seized by Kang Youwei. He suffered from world-weariness and resentment and died in sorrow. If he had informed, he should have received a great reward. How could he have ended up like this? Moreover, after Lord Tang died, his younger brother Caizhong was still alive and could have been consulted." Recently, reading Yunqixuan's collection of poems has further confirmed that the distinguished Mr. Wen did not inform. I will only cite his poem "Southern Village Tune" as evidence. This was Mr. Wen's lighthearted work during his later years of illness. The poem says:</p>
<p>A room sick like Vimalakirti, glad to see the idle courtyard closed to birds. Cooking medicine and turning books are full of flavor; ha ha, I, an old man, have no worries about what the world will do! Vast old mountains and rivers, who sheds more tears toward the New Pavilion? Only the partridge's song can say, "Brother! What can be done when the time is not right?"</p>
<p>It can be seen that Mr. Wen had unfulfilled ambitions and died in sorrow. He claimed to have no worries, but in fact he was always concerned about the state and the country. Because Mr. Gongzhi wrote to me asking for a correction, I specifically clarify it here.</p>

<p>Lepic: Beast! What, if war is declared with Germany, you won't even understand their writing? How will you deal with those Prussians?</p>
<p>Carrot Top: Ah! By the time war is declared, I'll have plenty of time to learn. You always use war to scare me. But I think it will definitely wait until after I graduate to break out.</p>
<p>Lepic: What was your last essay score? I hope you're not at the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: But someone has to be at the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>Lepic: Beast! I really want to take you out to dinner. If today were still Sunday! But during the school term, I absolutely do not want to disturb your studies.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: I personally don't have any important homework; how about you, Felix?</p>
<p>Felix: Exactly, this morning the teacher forgot to give us practice problems.</p>
<p>Lepic: But you can go and study the book a little more.</p>
<p>Felix: Ah! I've already memorized it, Dad. That's the lesson from yesterday.</p>
<p>Lepic: But in any case, I still want you to go back to school. I'll find a way to wait until Sunday, and then we can all go out to dinner together.</p>
<p>The time for farewell had come. Whether the older brother Felix looked disgruntled or Carrot Top pretended to be silent, they finally couldn't avoid parting.</p>
<p>Carrot Top waited for this moment of departure with anxiety.</p>
<p>"I wonder if my score will be better this time," he thought in his heart, "and whether my father is actually unhappy about my hugging and kissing him."</p>
<p>He made up his mind, looked straight ahead, raised his mouth high, and walked closer.</p>
<p>But Lepic stopped him with one hand and kept him at a distance, saying:</p>
<p>"That fountain pen on your ear is going to blind me. When you hug and kiss me, can't you put your pen somewhere else? Please pay attention to the fact that I've already taken off my cigarette?"</p>
<p>Carrot Top: Ah! Good Dad, please forgive me. Really, one day something unfortunate will happen because of my mistakes. Others have warned me long ago, but my pen fits so well on my ear that I've been keeping it there, and I've forgotten about it myself. I should have at least taken off the pen tip! Ah! Good Dad, it really makes me happy that I know my pen scares you.</p>
<p>Lepic: Beast! You almost blinded me, and you're happy about it?</p>
<p>Carrot Top: No, Good Dad, I'm happy about something else: I'm happy about a stupid idea in my mind.</p>
<p>Red Cheeks</p>
<p>The dean of St. Mark's College, as usual, checked the dormitory for a week and then left. Every student rolled into bed, as if hidden in a tube, shrunk small to avoid fogging out of bed. Supervisor Mr. Weiaolong looked around with his head held high, and seeing that everyone had fallen asleep, he stood on tiptoe and slowly twisted down the gas lamp. Suddenly, the students sleeping on the beds began to talk softly to their neighbors. The whispers between beds grew louder and louder. These moving lips caused a mixed sound throughout the dormitory. Sometimes, a short whistle or two would seep into the mixed sound. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e205">Several Paths to Reviving Chinese Tea <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Yi'an</p>
<p>I. The Tragic Decline of Foreign Sales</p>
<p>China is not only the motherland of tea production, but decades ago, all the tea consumed in the world was supplied by China. In China's foreign trade, tea exports accounted for more than 50% of the total at their peak. In the remote and impoverished areas of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang provinces, hundreds of thousands or even millions of households relied on tea production income to support their rural economies.</p>
<p>Since the successive development of Indian, Ceylon, and Javanese black tea, China's black tea exports have declined year by year, from a maximum of more than 1.66 million dan (in 1880) to just over 100,000 dan. Black tea from Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province has almost no foothold in domestic and foreign markets, except for Qimen black tea from Anhui and its neighboring areas, which still have considerable characteristics in terms of quality and can barely serve as a decoration.</p>
<p>Green tea, on the one hand, accounts for only one-eighth of the demand for black tea in various countries, and its foreign sales are not as high as those of black tea. On the other hand, it is also subject to competition from Japanese tea. Sales in the United States have been declining year by year, and sales in Africa are also gradually becoming dangerous. In recent years, the high-quality Chun Mee green tea produced in Wuyuan, Shexian, and Xiuning in Anhui, and the Pingshui tea produced in Shaoxing, Shangyu, and Shengxian in Zhejiang, are also in a precarious state!</p>
<p>Oolong tea produced in Fujian was originally one of the important products for export, but now it is also subject to competition from Taiwanese tea. Not only has the quantity decreased, but it will even disappear from overseas markets!</p>
<p>II. The Biggest Weakness</p>
<p>Although China is the motherland of tea, it is just like China being an old and large nation. The technology of cultivation and manufacturing is inferior to others, and the methods of sales promotion are inferior to others. No matter how excellent the natural quality is, it cannot be spared from being damaged and eliminated by others.</p>
<p>Why is China's tea industry so severely damaged? This is a question that those who care about the tea industry, or those who understand China's politics, economy, society, and culture, can give detailed reasons for, and there is no need to elaborate here. Now, let's briefly mention a few more fundamental issues.</p>
<p>(1) Aging Tea Trees: Tea tree cultivation in China mostly belongs to farmers' sideline occupations. They are casually propagated next to houses and on mountainsides. Modern cultivation techniques such as fertilization and pruning are certainly lacking, and even the necessary weeding and cultivation depend on the price of tea. In the past, when exports were strong and profits were high, not only could people pay attention to weeding and cultivation, but also new tea fields could be expanded or replanted from time to time. Now, except for casually picking some tender and old leaves in the spring for personal use or because it is required to be sent to the landlord as a tribute, they are sold if they can be sold; otherwise, they will no longer pay much attention to this unprofitable business. As a result, the remaining tea plants that have survived for hundreds of years or decades will inevitably gradually age. The more the tree weakens, the harder the tea becomes, and the lower the quality becomes. This point is not only not valued by ordinary tea merchants, but also most people who talk about tea industry issues have not paid attention to it. Let's take an example. Sichuan tea is inferior to that of Hubei and Hunan, Hubei and Hunan tea is inferior to that of Ningzhou, and Ningzhou tea is inferior to that of Qimen. This is a clear example, because Sichuan is the birthplace of China's tea industry, and it gradually developed from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, while the development of Qimen is still a matter of the last thirty to fifty years.</p>
<p>(2) Inferior Manufacturing: China has the most tea manufacturing methods. Since the history of tea, it cannot be said that the manufacturing methods are not sophisticated. As early as 1140 or 1150 years ago, the "Classic of Tea" written by Lu Yu of the Tang Dynasty recorded the drinking methods in great detail, but compared with the modern mechanization and scientification in India and Japan, it is naturally inferior! Simply put, the only requirement for green tea is to have a clear and fragrant color and taste, and the important standard for black tea is to have a bright color and a lasting tea taste. The former requires clear water color, and the latter requires clean vinegar fermentation. The scientific manufacturing method is not complicated. It is about how to use the two pigments chlorophyll and carotenoid, as well as the acid-degrading enzymes, contained in each kind of fresh tea leaves. When making green tea, high temperature is used to stop the action of carotenoid and melting enzymes that will turn red, so that not only the color of the green tea leaves is clear and the fragrance is increased, but also it will never change color. When making black tea, the opposite is true. An appropriate temperature is used to make the acidizing enzymes gradually change naturally until the original green leaves turn bright red. This is so scientific, and the taste, aroma, and even the shape are the same. The reason why the water color of Chinese red and green tea is not clear and the taste is not very lasting is that the manufacturing methods cannot be fully utilized. As a result, more than seven-tenths of the exported green tea must be artificially colored with various colors to deceive people. Black tea vinegar fermentation only uses sunlight and cannot adjust the temperature indoors, so it is subject to natural control and cannot compete with Indian and Ceylon tea!</p>
<p>(3) Too Many Names: Chinese people and domestic tea merchants often boast to the world about the breadth of our country's tea-producing areas and the variety of types. Of course, no one can match us in this regard, but precisely because of this, there are different manufacturing methods in different places; different shapes, colors, and luster; different tastes and aromas; thus, various different names are produced. Either named after the place, or named after the time, or named after the shape, or named after the object. If you add up the statistics, there are countless thousands of types. Speaking specifically of exported tea: Although the total number of names is only about twenty, there are great differences in the thickness and grades of the same type. In this way, not only is it extremely difficult to promote to foreign countries, but even foreign merchants cannot use a unified name and a unified price for unified sales. India's Lipton tea only has three grades of tea: yellow label, red label, and peach red label, and three prices, which are naturally conducive to promotion and sales.</p>
<p>(4) Excessive Exploitation: The Chinese people have suffered from thousands of years of feudal exploitation, especially in rural areas, where the exploitation is so heavy that there is no need to elaborate. In the past, during the prosperous era of tea trade, it didn't matter if they were heavily exploited. Now, costs are rising, tea prices are falling, local taxes and levies, merchant deductions, and foreign merchant monopolies are even worse than before. Qimen tea, known as the king of Chinese black tea, although the market price of new tea these days is lower than in previous years, it still goes up to 200 yuan per dan, but the price at which inland tea farmers sell to tea firms is only 5 jiao per jin using a 22-liang scale. Although it is too wet and must be dried to make less than half the weight, they can get at most only half the original price. Although this half of the amount still has to include the cost of packaging, manufacturing, and transportation, most of it is spent in the heavy exploitation relationship. Therefore, since the eighth year of the Republic of China, although export taxes have always been exempted, the sluggishness of tea exports remains the same. This does not mean that the government's restoration of export taxes is supported, but it is only to illustrate that other exploitation relationships are too serious, and simply exempting export taxes has no greater impact on the facts.</p>
<p>(5) Lack of Organization: The poor cultivation and manufacturing methods naturally make it difficult to compete with various countries. Too many names and excessive exploitation are certainly the biggest shortcomings in terms of promotion and cost, but the lack of a proper organization is also one of the major reasons why China's tea industry cannot be improved. Although there are strict organizations such as inland tea merchants, especially introduction houses in Shanghai and Hankou, they only protect the merchants' own groups, and although there are enthusiastic people, they are only a very small number. Just look at the tea industry improvement committees in India and Ceylon, which have various organizations for research, improvement, promotion, and publicity. Just the expenses from the tea surcharge income collected by the Advertising Propaganda Bureau (The Ceylon Mca Propaganda Board) organized in Ceylon last June reach more than 2.5 million yuan per year. The Japanese tea industry association has practical unions in counties and the central government, with clear systems for internal and external affairs. The expenses spent on the tea industry each year are also around one million yuan. These are all things that we cannot hope to achieve. There are certainly countless other shortcomings. Now, let's move on to discussing several paths to improve Chinese tea.</p>
<p>III. Revival Methods</p>
<p>It is not difficult to improve production techniques and eliminate exploitation relationships. Although the improvement of technology should theoretically go through a considerable period of research; but as far as the tea industry is concerned, on the one hand, it is not necessary to go through variety improvement like rice, wheat, and other crops, which often takes several years. It is enough to choose a site and engage in cultivation and active manufacturing at the same time. Secondly, India's black tea manufacturing and Japan's green tea manufacturing have already achieved considerable results. According to the results of this year's trials in various places, it can be said that 70 to 80% of the success has been achieved, and the goal can be achieved by imitating them. As for the point of exploitation, as long as politics is slightly on track, a piece of order, a few laws, can achieve considerable results in the shortest period of time. Therefore, reviving China's tea industry is no longer a question of how to improve production and eliminate exploitation relationships; but a question of what method to use to proceed; simply put, it is about how we should "do" it!</p>
<p>Our ways of doing it roughly fall into these three categories:</p>
<p>The first is the capitalist method. This is to imitate the way the British did it in India and Ceylon. Choose suitable tea-producing areas, use a large number of machines and a large area of tea planting to produce the necessary quantity for foreign promotion, from tens of thousands of dan to hundreds of thousands of dan to millions of dan. If it goes smoothly, it can be a small success in ten years and a great success in twenty years. However, the world's capitalism is now approaching its end. Regardless of whether China has such a large capital force, not to mention that China's tea production method is a small-farmer sideline type and has seasonality, with a maximum of only three or four productions per year, unlike the tropical areas of India and Ceylon, where it can be picked and manufactured all year round; not to mention that they already have decades of deep-rooted power, and the emerging small capitalism is difficult to compete with them. Therefore, this capitalist road is not easy to take.</p>
<p>The second is the cooperative type, which can also be said to be the road that Japan is currently taking. In the shortest possible time, we will formulate tea industry cooperation regulations and order all tea-producing provinces and counties, whether they are cultivators or manufacturers, to join the cooperative, and provide them with cash advances using new methods to enable them to jointly produce, jointly manufacture, and jointly sell; there is also a cooperative federation, which is preparing for joint direct export. This is certainly the most ideal and appropriate method. However, its shortcoming is that it is slow. Especially in China, where the territory is large, there are few talents, and farmers are too impatient to cooperate, it is inevitable that one thing is fixed only for something else to break, and besides, the countryside has frequently gone bankrupt, and the tea industry is so declining, how can we have the patience to slowly improve it? Therefore, this path is possible, but it cannot be taken at once!</p>
<p>The third is the state-owned type, which is also the unified way. Now, to revive China's rural areas, we must use revolutionary methods. The same is true for rural farmers and the tea industry. This so-called state-owned method should use the power of the central and provincial governments and the people to jointly operate, select suitable tea-producing areas in various provinces, delimit tea areas, and use the latest scientific methods to dispatch specialized personnel to cultivate and manufacture separately. All matters related to cultivation, manufacturing, and sales are carried out according to national plans. It is planned for six tea-producing provinces: (1) Hunan Province selects Anhua, Taoyuan, Pingjiang, and Xiangtan counties, producing 100,000 dan of black tea per year; (2) Hubei Province selects Puchi and Chongyang counties, producing 100,000 dan of black tea; (3) Jiangxi Province selects the vicinity of the former Ningzhou, producing 100,000 dan of black tea; (4) Anhui Province produces 100,000 dan of black tea in Qimen, Zhizhi (i.e., Qiupu), and Fuliang in Jiangxi, and 100,000 dan of Chun Mee in Wuyuan, Shexian, and Xiuning; (5) Zhejiang Province produces 100,000 dan of Pingshui green tea in the old Shaoxing counties, 50,000 dan of green tea in the Huzhou area, and 50,000 dan of black tea in Wenzhou; (6) Fujian Province produces 100,000 dan of green tea in the northern counties of Fuan and Fuding, and 100,000 dan of black tea in the western counties of Chong'an and Jian'an. This is a rough calculation, with an annual output of about 900,000 dan. With these 900,000 dan of improved red and green tea leaves, we can fight head-on with various tea-producing countries. Not only will the weak Japanese green tea fall at the first blow, but even Indian and Ceylon black tea will have to retreat. However, this unified method certainly has its advantages in terms of technological improvement, production consistency, and publicity and promotion, but the current government and people do not have such spiritual strength. As for state-owned, how easy is it to talk about? So, what should our current route be? Let's make a conclusion as follows.</p>
<p>The capitalist method should not be taken, the cooperative method is difficult to implement for a while, and the state-owned method that is in line with modern times cannot be taken now, so we have to take a mixed route of the second and third methods. This mixed route is that after the central and provincial governments have delimited the tea-producing areas in the country, on the one hand, they organize tea farmers, and on the other hand, they assign personnel to be responsible for guidance. From near to far, from small to large, we will conduct pilot projects in the first two to three years, and we can achieve small success in eight to ten years. But in any case, the most urgent things at present are, first, to thoroughly investigate the actual situation of tea-producing areas in the country; second, to quickly cultivate talents to guide the tea industry; and third, to first organize a group of competent authorities and tea merchants in the tea-producing provinces to discuss all the implementation plans.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Japanese Tea Industry and Its Aggression War Against China <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Juenong</p>
<p>Japan originally had no tea trees. It was only in 805 AD that tea was introduced to the country from China. In 1191, the second year of Shaoxi of Emperor Guangzong of the Song Dynasty, a large number of tea seeds were imported and propagated in various places. At first, they did not know how to manufacture tea, and they hired Chinese technicians to guide them; even for foreign exports, they had to entrust Chinese merchants to handle it in the beginning.</p>
<p>Since 1870, Japan began to carry out a tea industry innovation movement, sending personnel to China, India and other places for on-site investigation and research, and importing Indian tea-making machinery to first engage in the manufacture of black tea, and then gradually expanding the machinery for green tea to reduce manufacturing costs. Among them, the most alarming to us is the progress in methods such as pruning and fertilization, which not only improved the quality of the tea itself, but also greatly increased the yield per mu.</p>
<p>Year | Average Tea Garden Area (Mu) | Index | Average Tea Production (Dan) | Index</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>1892-1896 | 944,842 | 120 | 498,926 | 95</p>
<p>1897-1901 | 851,191 | 107 | 471,707 | 91</p>
<p>1902-1906 | 807,758 | 102 | 433,512 | 84</p>
<p>1907-1911 | 794,588 | 100 | 517,562 | 100</p>
<p>1912-1916 | 784,196 | 99 | 570,062 | 111</p>
<p>1917-1921 | 781,870 | 98 | 628,837 | 121</p>
<p>1922-1926 | 712,904 | 90 | 604,437 | 117</p>
<p>1927-1931 | 663,225 | 84 | 641,250 | 124</p>
<p>From the above table, we can see that although the area of tea gardens has decreased regularly year by year; the amount of tea produced in the past 30 years has increased very regularly. The progress of cultivation technology is the most noteworthy fact.</p>
<p>The driving force behind the progress of the Japanese tea industry is twofold. On the one hand, of course, is the government's advocacy and encouragement; and on the other hand, it is the organized and systematic tea industry association. This tea industry association is not like the guilds or associations gathered by merchants who only covet a portion of the benefits in China, but a group that unites tea farmers, sellers, tea shops, tea warehouses, and even exporters to seek the common interests of the tea industry. From villages to cities and counties to the central government, there is a systematic and very clear organization, which is similar to the cooperative organization currently advocated in China. Internally, it provides guidance and improvement, and externally, it promotes publicity. The government plans and subsidizes it, and the association makes active activities in all directions.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about foreign activities, which are actually the facts of fighting against Chinese tea. Because Japan only produces green tea, and the foreign sales of green tea, in the past and even now, are only to China.</p>
<p>Japan's foreign trade previously only included the United States and Canada, and the quantity to Canada was not very large. The sales in the United States can be said to have been completely monopolized by Chinese tea 50 or 60 years ago; but Japan used various publicity methods to gradually seize the position of Chinese tea. But the competition in the United States is already a past event; what makes us most saddened is the invasion of the largest sales markets in Russia and Africa in our country in recent years. Because in the past ten years, the only customer for Japanese green tea, the United States, has seen a year-by-year reduction due to the large-scale import of Indian, Ceylon, and Javanese black tea, as well as the massive dumping of coffee from South America. But the Japanese's foreign commercial policy is just like their military and diplomatic means, fierce, vicious, and invasive, and they do not choose the fat to bite, but instead take advantage of the weakness to attack. Naturally, the biggest impact is on China!</p>
<p>China's largest black tea sales market in the past was the United Kingdom, which had long been occupied by India and Ceylon. The secondary green tea sales market in the United States, as mentioned above, has also been taken over by Japan. Therefore, before the European War, most of it relied on Russia, and after the European War, most of it was in Africa. The Japanese painstakingly tried to please Russian merchants by taking advantage of the interruption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia; they adopted the policy of cheap dumping, spent huge amounts of advertising, and sought a way out in Africa. What was the result? They succeeded, and China's green tea exports were greatly affected! For clarity, the recent country-by-country foreign sales of Japanese tea and their figures are recorded below (unit: thousand pounds):</p>
<p>Country | United States | Canada | Russia | France and Morocco | China | Other</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>1928 | 19,915 | 2,538 | 1,433 | 丨丨 | 丨 | 丨</p>
<p>1929 | 16,969 | 2,561 | 3,312 | 丨丨 | 丨 | 11</p>
<p>1930 | 16,204 | 1,900 | 4,426 | 13 | 丨 | 丨</p>
<p>1931 | 18,590 | 1,949 | 4,862 | 555 | 414 | 2</p>
<p>1932 | 16,569 | 2,022 | 4,275 | 1,736 | 923 | 415</p>
<p>In the shortest period of time, the figures for sales to Russia and Africa have really made leaps and bounds. Sales to Russia were almost non-existent before 1926; now it accounts for the second largest tea exporting country in Japan; and in 1929, no tea was exported to Africa, but last year it reached a huge amount of more than 1.7 million pounds; what is even more heartbreaking is that the figure for tea exported to China is also about to reach a huge amount of one million pounds, and it goes without saying that this figure is for tea imported to the three northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>China's silk industry has almost been wiped out by Japanese silk; black tea has long been eroded by Indian and Ceylon tea and cannot recover. Now, the surviving green tea, the largest sales markets in Russia and Africa, has been occupied by Japanese tea. If we continue to be indolent and do not rise up to resist, we will inevitably follow in the footsteps of raw silk and black tea, and there will be no way to recover!</p>
<h3 id="e207">Several Examples of Tea Industry Innovation (Ying) <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>We have heard a lot about the need to improve Chinese tea manufacturing methods and to reform farmers' production and sales organizations; but how to improve? No one is doing it, and no one can show us the results! Now, giving us is also giving the community very good news, that is, improving production and improving organization are not only dawning, but also have actual results. It is written here for the common enjoyment of the people of the country.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Hunan Produces Excellent Machine-Made Green Tea <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The Hunan Provincial Government has established a tea experiment station in Anhua, and this year it used machinery to produce semi-mechanized improved green tea. It is said that the color, aroma, and taste are all excellent, and it is much better than Japanese green tea. Hunan is a famous tea-producing area, and the labor costs are extremely low. It was thought that it would not be possible to re-manufacture green tea before, but now it has been successful. The future direction is how to promote it to the people.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Ningzhou Black Tea Has Achieved Extraordinary Results <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The White Eagle Pit area of Ningzhou originally had a privately organized large-scale tea planting and manufacturing factory, which cost about 200,000 yuan of capital, but because of poor management, it was leased this year to the tea industry improvement farm jointly established by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute and the Shanghai Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau. The tea samples recently sent to Shanghai, its first-class imitation improved black tea color and taste can be comparable to Indian and Ceylon tea. Good Indian tea is currently worth about four yuan per pound on the Shanghai market. The second and third grades are also similar to the best Qimen black tea. The top price of Qihong last year was 220 taels, while Ninghong was only 70 taels, with a ratio of one to three. The farm is still in the first phase of the experiment in the shortest period of time, and it has already made a splash, giving a great stimulus to the improvement of China's tea industry!</p>
<h3 id="e210">Qimen Tea Begins to Organize a Marketing Cooperative <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Qimen tea is now the king of Chinese black tea. Because of the inconvenience of transportation, the difference between mountain prices and market prices is always more than double. The Construction Department of the Anhui Provincial Government established a provincial tea industry improvement farm at the former site of the National Tea Industry Experiment Station. This year, in addition to preparing various new-style machines to actively seek to improve the manufacturing methods of red and green tea, it also organized a marketing cooperative for farmers. The first batch of tea has arrived in Shanghai and should be estimated at a good price in the near future. This not only opens the prelude to cooperative marketing of tea, but in the future, if it can be promoted, the production of tea can be improved, and the suffering of farmers can also be completely alleviated.</p>
<p>Isn't this the most noteworthy thing to report in the voice of reviving the Chinese tea industry?</p>
<h3 id="e211">Prospects for Reforming China's Tea Industry <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Zhenhuan</p>
<p>Tea leaves, all grown on trees, are broadly categorized into black tea and green tea based on differing manufacturing methods. Green tea manufacturing involves two methods: pan-firing, called "chaoqing," and oven-drying, called "hongqing." In terms of color, aroma, and taste, Chinese tea is superior to tea from India, Ceylon, and Japan. However, in the early days of underdeveloped maritime transport, Chinese tea often took months, even years, to reach foreign countries. During this long journey, the color of the tea inevitably changed, affecting sales. Therefore, tea merchants artificially colored export tea, resulting in a difference between tea for foreign markets and tea for domestic consumption. Tea merchants believed that colored Chinese tea initially had good sales, but in reality, the consumers of this colored tea were not the civilized people of Europe and America, but foreign tea merchants who resold it to colored people in their colonies for profit. Europeans and Americans generally disliked drinking colored Chinese tea because they considered it detrimental to health. As a result, China's green tea trade has been declining day by day. The root cause lies entirely in the coloring process.</p>
<p>Therefore, improving green tea exports is not difficult; it simply requires banning coloring and adopting new manufacturing methods. Tea merchants are well aware of this, but they believe that although the colored green tea trade is declining, it can still survive. If coloring is suddenly eliminated, they fear losing even the existing sales. However, this argument is misleading. Today's maritime transport is much more advanced than before, reducing the travel time for exported green tea. Moreover, there are new green tea manufacturing methods that can keep the tea's color unchanged. Recently, the tea research stations in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces have achieved considerable success after conducting trials under guidance from the provincial authorities. If improved manufacturing methods are promoted among the people in the future, the aforementioned difficulties can be resolved. Even if trade cannot increase immediately, it will eventually recover, prosper, and restore its former glory. Therefore, improving the green tea trade is not a major difficulty; it only requires merchants to sacrifice temporarily, resolutely ban coloring, and adopt new manufacturing methods.</p>
<p>As for black tea, foreign teas are manufactured indoors and fermented thoroughly, resulting in a bright and rich color that is pleasing to the eye. However, apart from the color, both the aroma and taste are far inferior to Chinese tea. If we can improve our manufacturing methods to make the tea more fermented and richer in color, in addition to its inherent aroma and taste, it will not be difficult to displace Ceylon and Indian teas and dominate the world market.</p>
<p>Therefore, improving manufacturing methods is crucial for developing China's tea trade. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry recently dispatched specialists to guide the tea research stations in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces to adopt new manufacturing methods. The new tea produced this year has been inspected, and the color of various black teas is richer than those produced by the old methods. The color of various green teas is as green as jade and can be stored for a long time. This can be considered the first success in improving Chinese tea manufacturing methods, a truly gratifying event.</p>
<p>In addition to manufacturing methods, promotion is also important. China's foreign tea trade has long been monopolized by foreign firms, with very few direct promotions in foreign markets. Due to a lack of publicity, foreigners are often unaware of the quality of Chinese tea and are instead misled by the one-sided promotions of Indian and Japanese merchants. Therefore, after manufacturing methods are improved, improvements in international promotion and direct trade can secure the prosperity of China's tea trade. Recently, a Chinese consul stationed in England suggested that China should cultivate Indian tea varieties for improvement. However, the quality of Chinese tea is the best in the world, and Indian tea was originally transplanted from China. It's just that others know how to adapt and improve with the times, while we stick to old methods and lag behind.</p>
<p>People often cite high costs and heavy taxes as obstacles to developing commodity sales. However, if the quality is not improved and promotion is inadequate, even if the price is low, it will ultimately be rejected.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and banks were closed as usual. Although money shops were ostensibly open for business, in practice there was little difference from a holiday. As a result, market conditions were sluggish, the market was sparsely populated, and transactions were minimal. The call loan rate opened at 6% in the morning and afternoon, slightly lower than the previous day. Money shops received only over 2.7 million yuan in silver dollars, while inward remittances from various routes amounted to over 300,000 yuan and outward shipments to other regions were 100,000 yuan. Call loan transactions totaled over 4.46 million yuan in the morning session for maturing tickets, and over 700,000 yuan for new tickets. Afternoon session transactions were over 200,000 yuan, and transactions in the Small General Association amounted to over 50,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Securities: Peace Sentiment Boosts Bond Market Last Week <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>A Sense of "The End of the Road and a Glimmer of Hope"</p>
<p>During the week of May 15th to 20th, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange's bond market experienced significant turbulence, with rapid price fluctuations. In an extremely adverse environment, a glimmer of hope suddenly appeared, creating a sense of "the end of the road and a glimmer of hope." Huang Fu's trip to Beiping and the US President's advocacy for peace acted like a stimulant for a weak body, instantly making it feel refreshed and full of energy. Market sentiment was uniformly excited, with the bond market expected to soar. Furthermore, with the May futures trading entering its final week, it triggered a severe short squeeze. Although large institutions and financial circles engaged in massive selling, it was like trying to stop boiling water with a ladle, proving futile and demonstrating the strength of market sentiment. However, in reality, it did increase a significant amount of capital, enough to ease the atmosphere considerably. On Monday, Beiping and Tianjin were extremely tense, with Luanxi, Tangshan, and Miyun falling one after another, and market prices continued to fall by several points. On Tuesday, news of Huang Fu's entry into Beiping emerged, and the atmosphere of peace became prevalent, causing market prices to rebound sharply. Various groups bought in, creating a surge. The price rose by 1.67 yuan throughout the day, causing short sellers to panic even more. On Wednesday, they continued to cover, and the price continued to rise by about half a yuan. On Thursday, the situation became even more tense with the US President's peace appeal, and the price rose even more sharply. However, this prompted large institutions, "No. 32," and financial circles, "No. 46," to sell massive amounts of salt revenue bonds, causing the salt revenue bonds to plummet by 1.2 yuan at the close. The previous gains were offset by the later losses, creating a contrasting and colorful picture. On Friday, "No. 66" continued to sell, but short covering surged even more, and market prices continued to rise by 89 points. On Saturday, due to riots in Beiping and Tianjin and the lack of factual evidence of peace, market prices weakened slightly by about half a yuan. As a result of the week, the total increase ranged from several points to over two yuan. Summarizing the trends of the past few days, the peace sentiment coincided with the approach of settlement, triggering a fierce short squeeze. As market prices rose, it also triggered the sale of physical goods by financial circles. The floating shorts all found a way out as a result. The trend from now on will certainly continue to fluctuate significantly. If peace is achieved, prices will continue to rise. If peace remains an illusion, then Beiping and Tianjin will inevitably be devastated, and the bond price collapse will be even worse than before the short squeeze. This is because a batch of floating longs will inevitably be added after the short squeeze. Trading was brisk, and the number of transactions was very impressive, totaling 82.2402 million yuan. Among them, spot transactions accounted for 85,200 yuan, with salt revenue bonds accounting for the most among futures, totaling 22.735 million yuan. Demobilization accounted for 3.165 million yuan, consolidated tax accounted for 12.46 million yuan, the 1919 Customs Bonds accounted for 12.135 million yuan, and the 20-year and 20-Customs Bonds together accounted for 16.795 million yuan. Disbandment also saw 3.07 million, and the remainder ranged from tens of thousands to four or five hundred thousand. Most of the transactions were for forward dates. A total of 210 shares were traded in the Exchange.</p>

<p>(Jiangdu) This year, both farmers and silkworms are struggling due to a lack of resources to raise silkworms. Most are borrowing money to buy silkworm eggs. Hatching is not going well. Areas with relatively large-scale silkworm rearing include Yiling City, En Yu Zhou, Liu Er Wei, and Hongqiao. When the eggs were received, the weather was sunny and warm, and the silkworm larvae developed smoothly. The early batches have already completed their third molt and are consuming leaves, with some already emerging from their fourth molt. The late batches have also completed their third molt and are consuming leaves. However, over the past week, the weather has been constantly changing, with continuous thunderstorms and hail, followed by sultry heat and sudden cold. This has caused the early silkworms to stop eating and lose their molts, while the late silkworms have developed black spots on their bodies and die within 24 hours of moving to the mat. Silkworm farmers are panicking. They are currently trying to remove the diseased silkworms and using heat to maintain the temperature in an attempt to salvage the situation.</p>
<p>(Shaoxing) It is also an improved silkworm farming area in Zhejiang Province. This year, farmers have found it difficult to increase the scale of rearing due to economic reasons. After hatching, the climate has been warm and suitable, and instructors have been assisting with guidance. The silkworm larvae have been developing well. The early batches in areas such as Tianle Township and Lizhu have already reached their fourth molt, while the late silkworms in areas such as Huajia Dian in Anren Township have also completed their third molt and are consuming leaves. However, in recent days, continuous thunderstorms and alternating cold and heat have caused changes in the silkworm larvae, leading to diarrhea, vomiting of black fluid, swollen heads, and delayed feeding, with many being discarded. With the silkworms about to spin their cocoons, this sudden change has caused silkworm farmers to feel extremely frustrated.</p>

<p>With 40 to 50 dealers participating, the market initially showed some activity due to cloudy weather. Later, with the sudden clearing of clouds and sunshine, the merchants' enthusiasm waned, causing the situation to feel weak. Furthermore, merchants were strict in their selection, although there were still over 1,500 bags being purchased, with a small portion being shipped to Weihaiwei and Yantai by sea. Most of it was intended to be stored in warehouses, so the situation could not be described as truly robust. The market prices of Su Tong, Chang, Nangang, Qingjiao, Songsi, and Xilian rice varieties have fallen by several cents. With the approaching of the moldy season, there is little hope for further improvement. The pricing of "Du Yang Jian" (a type of rice) has been fixed, and the market is showing signs of weakness.</p>

<h3 id="e221">The Secret of Getting Rich <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Recently, many miracles can often be found in newspapers. In addition to a certain comrade learning diligently under Mussolini after ceding national territory, they have also learned a little secret of getting rich. Since the secret concerns getting rich, it is of course most needed at present, even though those above are determined to destroy the country, and the common people have no wealth to protect. If we are lucky enough to have our fortune and luck written in the stars, we can get rich once in a big way. Then, at least we can order a large Ford aircraft from abroad. In case "luring the enemy deep" leads us all the way to Yuhuatai, we can simply ride the auspicious clouds and leave together.</p>
<p>So, what is the secret of getting rich? It is: the only way is to buy lottery tickets. Facts speak louder than words. It is said that more than twenty workers jointly won the first prize of 50,000 yuan. As a result, some decided to remarry instead of staying widowers, some decided to no longer be insignificant clerks in foreign firms, and some who suffered losses in the Shanghai war were able to prosper again. In short, sudden wealth can completely solve any major problem, and even buying a small official position and taking office immediately is not impossible. Of course, this is greatly related to luck, but the secret of getting rich lies in this.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the current period of national crisis, there are even more opportunities to use this secret. That is to say, there are currently so many types of lottery tickets, just like the "numerous and too many to list" in summer discount stores. However, the most reliable is something called ×××× Construction Lottery Tickets. The first prize is 500,000 yuan, and the second prize can also be 100,000 yuan each. In addition, it is declared in advance that there will be "full payment" without any deductions. Therefore, this type of lottery ticket is not only very hopeful (because "one out of every ten tickets will win a prize"), but also very reliable. Not only that, but in addition to "huge prize amounts" and "rare opportunities," there is also the upright political significance of "both helping construction" and "receiving bonuses."</p>
<p>Regarding this section, it is indeed very exciting. In fact, apart from saving the country through aviation, there is no other way. Moreover, striving for construction amid national panic is even more of an astonishing move to make the enemy gasp. However, great construction requires huge amounts of money, and huge amounts of money can only come from the broad masses. Thus, there is this unique and wonderful method of "the whole country benefits, and everyone can win prizes," allowing us common people to "quickly join the work for the country and the family" after buying a well-winged copper badge. No problem, just taking out ten yuan is considered fulfilling the responsibility of loving the country. If you can win a prize, of course, you will get both fame and fortune. So, in the end, I want to respectfully tell everyone, come on, "quickly join the work for the country and the family"!</p>
<h3 id="e222">The Sin of the Common People <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Huan Yi</p>
<p>Some things in the world are truly inexplicable. For example, the wealthy bosses who often possess hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets, are trying to have a son. Even though they have married dozens of concubines, they still face the sorrow of having no heir, because the inheritance problem is difficult to solve, leaving them at a dead end. At the same time, the coolies who live in grass shacks cannot even afford to eat, but their families are thriving. They see their children popping out one after another, and they can't afford to abandon them or raise them, leaving them at a dead end. In the darkness, the creator seems to be deliberately playing jokes on them.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, we unfortunately encountered the young marshal Zhang, the great inventor of non-resistance, who generously gave whatever they wanted, and successively handed over the three northeastern provinces, inviting the enemy into the customs in a mighty way. It is said that on the night of the September 18th Incident, when the sounds of gunfire erupted in Shenyang, he was dancing and singing with extreme joy. Later, Jinzhou was generously gifted, and Yuguan and Rehe also changed color. The situation in Beiping and Tianjin suddenly became urgent, threatening his dancing and golfing pleasures. He simply rolled up his bedding, loaded his years of hard-earned money—no, it was the fat of the common people—onto dozens of tarpaulin-covered trucks, transported it to the Shanghai concessions, settled down, and happily ran off to enjoy his blessings abroad.</p>
<p>In fact, in our vast Republic of China, there are wise, resourceful, brave, and skilled armed comrades who are said to be loyal and patriotic everywhere. Is it not the case when they fight among themselves? What declarations and telegrams, full of grand principles of serving the country and the people, are spoken with the eloquence of heaven. The young marshal Zhang, who is now striking and traveling, also used to flaunt his power and invincibility, making a heroic display more than once. But precisely when he converted to Zen Buddhism, (a certain celebrity initiated a Vajra Dojo last year, and our young marshal was also one of the initiators) and strictly forbade killing, he encountered this unfortunate event. The incense burner chased away the monk. Isn't it destiny?</p>
<p>"Duolun Fell" and "Tangshan Lost" were printed in large fonts in the most prominent positions in the newspapers. But in another corner of the newspaper, Sichuan's Army Commander Liu and Chief Commander Deng were heating up again, staging a repeat of last year's antics, and the atmosphere was extremely tense, with war clouds looming, and the situation had the potential to expand and affect the entire Sichuan. According to their telegrams, both sides were ultimately acting for the country and the people, and were forced to wage this just war. As for which country and which people they were fighting for, the telegram did not specify. Some people say: if they want to resist Japan, then at least they should wait until the enemy is right in front of them before resisting, so as not to fail the meaning of the word "resist." Especially in the art of war, familiarity is key. Taking advantage of this free time, it would be wise to practice among themselves first as a precautionary measure. When the enemy reaches Sichuan from the north bank of the Yellow River to the south bank of the Yellow River, and from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the generals can rest easy and order the soldiers, who have experienced hundreds of battles, to prepare for a long-term resistance, with one soldier capable of holding off ten thousand. Wouldn't victory be guaranteed?</p>
<p>But, in short, in the final analysis, it is still the "deep sins" of our common people. Otherwise, why would we need to bother these warlord lords with their far-sighted plans! If they continue to protect us like this, I'm afraid that even the small place where the common people can stand will be gone!</p>

<p>— Tang Daowu</p>
<p>What have I been doing with my pen all these years?</p>
<p>Silently waiting for advancement, deceiving myself.</p>
<p>My heroic spirit fades away in books and ledgers,</p>
<p>My grand aspirations are futile as time passes.</p>
<p>I often crave sleep to find my dreams of home,</p>
<p>And write poems to express my idle sorrows.</p>
<p>Unaccustomed to wandering, yet a visitor I remain,</p>
<p>Who knows the feelings in my heart?</p>
<p>Jia Yi's worries and indignation were in vain,</p>
<p>He could not wield the sun-retrieving lance to save the country.</p>
<p>The strategy was decided only after the enemy entered the critical pass,</p>
<p>Half the country was lost, yet they speak of peace.</p>
<p>Though the barbarians are said to be truly rampant,</p>
<p>Who caused the protective barrier to be lost in an instant?</p>
<p>From ancient times, hesitation has led to downfall,</p>
<p>Planning the defense, I sigh and delay again.</p>

<p>— Ai Hua</p>
<p>Although Mr. Wang is poor, his background is truly not humble. His grandfather was a Daotai in the Qing Dynasty, and his father also served as a magistrate. He even has an uncle who is currently working as some kind of bureau chief. Unfortunately, his ancestors didn't leave much property for their descendants, and his father died too early. By the time his mother raised him and his three siblings, almost half of their meager inheritance had been used up. After his mother died, the siblings divided the property, and what each person received was truly insignificant. He himself had already started a family. He has a wife, two sons, and a daughter. Because he only has a middle school education and lacks the ability to scheme, he can only teach some courses at a small school, earning forty or fifty dollars in salary. Including some interest from his property, his total monthly income is only sixty or seventy dollars. But how does he spend it? Although he is not a middle-class family, he can't be considered anything less than a middle-class person. The face of a middle-class person must be maintained. He can't live in a pigeon coop. At the very least, he rents two rooms on the upper floor, which costs thirty dollars in rent. His children, who are of school age, have to be sent to school. At the beginning of the semester, he has to prepare forty or fifty dollars for tuition and miscellaneous fees. His youngest son is still breastfeeding. He can't bear to let his wife hold the child and go out to buy things. Moreover, he comes from a prominent family, and he is not used to doing such things. So, he has to hire an old nanny, whose wages and food take up one-sixth or one-seventh of his income. When relatives and friends have weddings, funerals, or birthdays, and send invitations, he has to attend out of courtesy. When giving gifts, he certainly can't give small change. For closer relatives, he has to give at least three or four dollars. Although he can try his best to economize on food, he has to pay attention to the health of his family. In Shanghai, under capitalism, getting sick is even more terrible. Wasn't his second son suffering from illness due to malnutrition, and because he didn't have much money to see a doctor, he just died like that? So, he really puts in a lot of effort to maintain the face of this middle-class family. The formerly chubby Mr. Wang, with a face full of spring breeze, has now become the gaunt, dark-faced Mr. Wang. When you talk to him, he is always full of complaints, as if he has nowhere to vent. He often sighs and says, "A family like mine is truly in an awkward situation. I really don't know how to maintain it."</p>

<p>Japanese students use their spare time to measure our country's land or draw maps to send to their government to invade our country! What about our students? They run to movie theaters and dance halls in their spare time. It seems that Chinese students are not as good as Japanese students! However, at the very least, we should blame the government for not guiding students and not giving them work to do. For example, if a Chinese student wanted to measure the Wusong Fort now, perhaps they would be invited to the headquarters? The corruption of Chinese academic atmosphere may be due to the government's failure to guide students?</p>

<p>Some people say that female college students are future concubines. This statement seems very harsh, and it may not be so. However, observing most of the female students going to school as if they were visiting guests? Applying eyebrow pencil and rouge, perming their hair and applying powder, wearing high-heeled leather shoes and short-sleeved cheongsams, it really makes people dare not say they don't believe it?</p>

<p>Teachers say: students' exam scores are getting worse every year. Students say: teachers are setting more difficult questions than in previous years. In the end, are the questions difficult? Or are the students' levels inadequate? I really want to ask!</p>

<p>Some people say: It is most unfortunate to be a Chinese student. Indeed, during their study period, they cannot concentrate on their studies. Seeing the urgent situation, they have to shout a few times to urge the government to wake up. If they are slightly more radical, they will be suspected of being anti-××! As for studying? When you study history, it's really terrible! Just the years, contents, and reasons for the national humiliations and the various humiliating treaties are already very difficult to remember.</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>There are two brothers, A and B, who are fellow countrymen. When dividing the property, there was still an unmarried younger sister. Therefore, they set aside two acres of land as the sister's future marriage expenses and all other costs. At that time, because A was not good at production, the relatives designated B as the custodian, stating that B would be fully responsible for taking care of the sister in the future. When the sister got married, all expenses were still shared equally by A and B: B never made any compensation. Now, more than twenty years have passed, and all the evidence of both parties has been lost, and the witnesses have also passed away one after another. Currently, A intends "Since all expenses have been shared equally, this land should be enjoyed equally. Since B has received more than twenty years of rent, A should also have the same right to take turns." But B only agrees to refund A thirty dollars, regardless of whether it's a gain or a loss, and settle it in one go. According to the current market price, this land is worth two hundred and thirty dollars. Therefore, A firmly disagrees; the two parties have reached a deadlock. If it's not handled well, they may even go to court; sir, what is your opinion on this matter? I respectfully request</p>
<p>Yours truly, Yao Muyuan</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Law is something that arises after society has no other way. Therefore, no matter what happens, if there is another possible solution, it is best not to consult it. Between brothers, what is valued is deep affection, so they should not resort to law. In this matter, A may fail in law. He can't produce evidence, and he can't find witnesses. Since there was an agreement beforehand, why did you take out money when the sister got married? Unless you were willing to donate it, you should have obtained B's written statement. How can donated items be claimed from a third party? Moreover, since B has openly occupied these two acres of land for more than twenty years, and A has never raised any objections, the law has no way to recover it for you. However, in terms of human relationships, B really has an obligation to consider compensating A. As we see it, A's situation must have been worse than B's at first; when the sister got married, A's situation must have been better than B's: and now A is probably not as good as B again. So, even without this entanglement, B would have to take care of A to some extent, especially since he still has some reasons! This matter depends entirely on the intermediary to persuade him properly; to make A understand that he may not win in law and make concessions; and to make B reflect on himself, consider the facts, and give more.</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>13, Poor Child</p>
<p>This afternoon, the young master Zhang was indeed sitting in Miss Liu's living room.</p>
<p>Miss Liu came down from upstairs, the heels of her leather shoes making a slight low sound on the carpeted stairs. As usual, she had a tired heart, but her face was filled with a dignified and beautiful smile. Although she herself felt that this kind of smiling face was somewhat unnatural, it was also a kind of profound art. This art was something she had gained arduously in the course of her life. Just from this point, it can be seen how clever our Miss Liu is.</p>
<p>When she walked into the living room, the first thing she saw was young master Zhang bowing to her in a very polite and large angle. After that, his eyes were shining with excitement, and if you looked carefully, it seemed that even the muscles on his face were trembling slightly. However, this graceful and elegant behavior made Miss Liu feel amused, although at the same time it also gave him a little bit of goodwill of pity in her heart.</p>
<p>"I'm being very presumptuous, Miss! Can you not hate me for coming to visit you so boldly?"</p>
<p>"No, Zhang... um... what should I call you? Haha..." She covered her laughter with her handkerchief.</p>
<p>"As long as you're happy, Miss! Isn't it okay to call me anything? My name is Wenbin."</p>
<p>"Then I'll just call you Mr. in a very ordinary way. Do you like this title? Maybe it's too plain."</p>
<p>"No, Miss! This is already very good."</p>
<p>"I guess this is your first time coming to my house, right? It seems like we've never met before."</p>
<p>"That's right, today is my first time coming to your residence. But I've seen you before, it was the night before yesterday when Minister Su, Mr. Su Gengyun's mother had her birthday. It just so happened that Minister Su insisted on me helping with the reception, and we met that night. But because there were too many guests, and I'm not good at entertaining, you probably don't remember much."</p>
<p>"Ah! So that's how it is, then does that mean you and Minister Su are also relatives?"</p>
<p>So young master Zhang took the opportunity to explain; he is now a first-class clerk in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Minister Su is his direct superior. He spoke in fluent Mandarin. This made Miss Liu very enthusiastic, and between his eyebrows and dancing, there was indeed a lot of youthful and handsome air. As for his every move, he was also very dashing, even to the point of striking a match, it was also very romantic and not vulgar.</p>
<p>This time she talked to him enthusiastically for a long time, until she lazily leaned back on the sofa and yawned. Finally, listening to him very sincerely asking her:</p>
<p>"Tonight, can I accompany Miss to the theater once?"</p>
<p>"But she didn't agree, saying that she wasn't feeling well, and also advising him not to spend money on her. Afterwards, he said in a pleading tone:</p>
<p>"Then will you allow me to visit you again sometime?"</p>
<p>"You wait, I'll personally call you to invite you." After saying that, she added a touch of rich smile. But it could be seen that he was still very uneasy, so when she sent him to the door, she said more gently:</p>
<p>"Thank you for your kindness, let's meet again."</p>
<p>She watched his back, waiting until she uttered a sentence at her lips:</p>

<p>— Yi Fan</p>
<p>A Glimpse into the Difficult Life of Actors</p>
<p>Jean Hersholt Recalls Events of Ten Years Ago</p>
<p>Robert Montgomery recently went to Hawaii to film "Hell Below." After returning, he talked to people about the various difficult tasks of filming near the volcano. An old actor named Jean Hersholt heard this. He said, "This is nothing. When I was filming 'Greed' in Death Valley ten years ago, that was scary." People then asked him to talk about the story of ten years ago. It was indeed very terrifying. Now I will translate it, which can show the general Chinese actors what kind of sacrifices they should be prepared to make for the sake of realism when foreign productions are made, and how much perseverance they should have, so that their lives are in danger or even lost. The following are the words of Jean Hersholt:</p>
<p>Death Valley ten years ago was very different from what it is now. Now there are places to avoid the heat, and there are roads leading to it, but in 1923, it was still like 1848, when the Bennett Expedition was trapped in thousands of miles of white sand and died of thirst. Because there is not a drop of water in Death Valley, and not a blade of grass grows, the temperature is as high as 160 degrees. In the summer, even the native Indians dare not set foot on it. But I and the other actors, under the guidance of director Erich von Stroheim, actually set off for Death Valley in July, the hottest month of the year.</p>
<p>After we passed through Long Pine and filmed a few scenes, we arrived at Skidoo, a small village outside Death Valley. The radio on the car suddenly broke down. So, from that point on, we were cut off from the civilized world. Later, we moved forward to Darwin, where I encountered another very unfortunate event. Because the horse I was riding was an uncontrollable bad horse. He threw me off and I was seriously injured. But there were no doctors in Darwin, so someone had to be sent to Bishop to ask for a doctor. I had to endure the pain and wait quietly for the doctor to arrive. Later, the doctor came and, after an X-ray examination, knew that I had broken two ribs and injured my hip bone, and I would have to rest for at least three weeks before I could work.</p>
<p>Director Erich von Stroheim had no choice but to leave me behind and set off on his own. But the main actors in "Greed" were only me and Miss Gish. I was sick, and the filming work was suspended and could not proceed. So Erich von Stroheim turned back halfway and had a big fight with me. He scolded me for being a bastard, having no conscience, being lazy, and making the whole team unable to work. In the end, he forced me to get up and go with him. Poor me, I had only rested for five days when I got up from the sickbed and set off with them. On the road, I stumbled and fell, my whole body was in pain, and I groaned constantly, but I had to endure the pain and move forward. My hatred for Erich von Stroheim at that time was indescribable.</p>
<p>In this way, our team moved forward slowly, passing through many places, even the names of which were strange and terrifying, until we reached a place called "Furnace Creek." This is the deepest part of Death Valley, much lower than sea level. There is a small village in Furnace Creek, which is the only place in the entire valley where traces of living people can be found. In this place, we settled down and filmed movies for two weeks, under the scorching sun. Further ahead, we reached "Devil's Golf Course," because this is the most rugged place in Death Valley. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e229">Review of "The Road" <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Zhang Shichuan once said in the first issue of "Star Monthly," "Please watch me go from 'Lipstick Market' to my 'Road,'" If we understand this sentence, then, we can see that he is quite confident in these two works. Of course, in "Lipstick Market," generally speaking, it can be considered above the standard, but what about "The Road"? It makes us unable to be satisfied.</p>
<p>Of course, in order to promote Chinese films to take a healthy path, we must engage in honest criticism.</p>
<p>Regarding the performance of The Road, the director's skills are indeed very lacking. Apart from the fact that the overall plot can progress in an orderly and uncomplicated manner, there are some aspects of the individual scenes that deserve our attention. The first is the portrayal of the protagonist, Su Lanying, which is truly unsatisfactory. After she became the wife of an official, her material life was naturally very rich, and her lifestyle would naturally change greatly. This can be proved by her love for puppies, but apart from raising puppies, she doesn't even understand the "fashion" of clothes, and even needs the instructions of a maid. When the tailor sent the new clothes, she was very feudal and hated his touching her hands and feet, but in another dance scene, she was actually willing to be hugged and danced and suddenly became "modern." Second, when Su Lanying, holding her sick husband, walked towards the luxurious hospital, the hospital nurses actually lined up to welcome her. From the tea boy to the accountant, they all bowed respectfully to this lady. Scenes like this are too "theatrical." Third, after Yao Junjie became an official, he actually "indulged" boldly in the office, which is also an exaggeration and inevitably untrue. Indeed, the intention is to expose the ugliness of the officialdom, but it is not so bad that it would be so bold even in the office. Fourth, when Su Lanying watched her husband and the social butterfly Pan Xuefen whispering sweet words, she actually stood there blankly for several minutes, while her husband acted as if she didn't exist, but at first she was flustered... There are many others, but unfortunately I can't remember them all at once. For example, that dance is not worth the effort. However, there are also many good things: such as seeing the shacks of the slums in the high-end hospital, and Pan Xuefen spying on Su Lanying's actions in the hotel, etc.</p>
<p>However, the content of a film is not limited to technical aspects, and whether the story is sound or not is the biggest key to the film.</p>
<p>Then, Mr. Ding Qianping, the screenwriter of "The Road," disappointed people after watching "Raging Current" and "Lipstick Market."</p>
<p>A famous woman will indeed often have extravagant hopes and will inevitably be raised by people with status in society. So Su Lanfen married a foreign student under the explanation of "a woman must have a lifelong commitment." Later, her husband became an official and changed his mind towards his wife. So Mr. Ding Qianping told us on the screen that this woman lost in love and did not hesitate to abandon her wife's status and still lived her actor's life. However, the subtitles say that she is unwilling to be insulted by men and strives for her personality and for her "future," but how does she strive? After the heroine did not receive her former lover, she shrugged her shoulders and gave a bitter smile, as if saying "Everything is over"! As for whether the wife of an official would be so brave and enlightened? It is also something we dare not imagine. However, the intention of the screenwriter lies in explaining the "women's occupation" issue, although in fact there is no way out, which is equivalent to no solution.</p>
<p>Regarding the performance, no actor achieved a high standard. Relatively speaking, Xuan Jinglin was still serious, and Zhu Qiuhen was also okay, but Wang Jiting was unpleasant.</p>
<p>However, the success of this film lies in the scenery and photography, where it can be seen that the skills of Chinese films are still improving.</p>
<p>Audience Comments</p>
<h3 id="e230">Review of "Flower of Hell" <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ling</p>
<p>In a society under the capitalist system, love is completely built on money, banknotes, and cars. All social butterflies and beautiful girls will go into the arms of pot-bellied wealthy merchants and bankers, and poor boys will naturally not dare or be able to ask. This "Flower of Hell" writes about the typical American society where women generally use money as an exchange condition for love.</p>
<p>The story in the film can be said to be very complicated. The ending consciousness is contradictory. If the last paragraph is deleted, and it tells the story of a dissolute woman who exchanges her body for money, it could have become a powerful work exposing the deformed ugliness of capitalist society. However, the filmmakers were unwilling to do so and insisted on adding that incoherent story of a happy ending with a detective. As a result, it has only become a very ordinary pastime for the idle!</p>
<p>The acting skills are not bad. The director has a little cleverness. The opening close-up shots of several "scenery lines" in the restaurant are clever and concise. It is indeed not easy to perform such a complicated script so fluently and clearly. The editing of the scenes is appropriate, and small actions are given considerable consideration.</p>
<p>The heroine, May Vances, is appearing on the screen for the first time. Although she has not made any special contributions, it is gratifying that someone with very little screen experience can achieve such results. Her attitude is always very natural, and she expresses the mood of a dissolute woman who only wants money very thoroughly. Especially the charming attitude when singing, it is very much like Jean Harlow. The other supporting actors, Noah Beery, are mediocre, and Cary Grant is quite competent.</p>
<p>The pronunciation, photography, and lighting are as good as other Paramount films, and the taverns in the background are also very realistic and appropriate.</p>

<p>— Kang Bing</p>
<p>"Since I was a child, I have been afraid of the dark. Even though I know I am cowardly, no matter what, I am afraid of dark places. So my room is always lit with a small light from night to dawn," Joan Crawford said:</p>
<p>"Not long ago, I encountered a strange thing. At 11 o'clock one night, this light suddenly flickered as if it was about to go out. At that time, I didn't pay much attention, thinking it was just a problem with the current. Unexpectedly, at the same time the next night, from 11 o'clock to 12 o'clock, the light did the same again. So I called an electrician to repair the wire and the light. But no damage was found. On the third night, we all stayed in the house and guarded the light, turning on all the lights in the house. At 11 o'clock, the light in my room acted up again. On the fourth night, I moved my room to the living room, because I was afraid of the dark, and I installed another light outside. Unexpectedly, at 11 o'clock, the newly installed light flickered in the same way. We were all baffled."</p>
<p>"The next morning, I received a bad telegram from New York. It said that my closest friend had died last night. According to the telegram, she had been in the hospital for four days, and every night around 11 o'clock, she became very sad and missed me. After the fourth night, my light was just like usual. This is really an inexplicable thing."</p>

<p>Sacrificing Reputation and Happiness for Love</p>
<p>It really is strange, how life can change so abruptly. The colors are still the same, yet they are different; her heart feels a mysterious joy, a different kind of hope. He will surely come!—But in an instant, she is enveloped by the wings of doubt. He will surely not come!—Angela wrote a short note and sent it to the barracks. That dream is now naturally in the past. She hopes she hasn't made him too sad—he wouldn't really be worried about her, would he? Would he? She indulged in wishful thinking for a very long time.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Vaudre," she whispered to herself. She stood with her eyes closed for a moment. Then, taking a deep breath, she walked out of the room.</p>
<p>Downstairs, in the grand living room, a dance was in progress to celebrate her engagement to Ernest. The music from the hidden orchestra floated up the curved staircase. At the foot of the staircase, her father was talking to Reverend Sarah Newnasser. Seeing her approaching, he smiled and proudly pulled her into his embrace, kissing her affectionately.</p>
<p>Angela fixed her gaze on his eyes. She wanted to confide in him her deepest feelings, but she was distressed and unable to speak. Feeling that she no longer had the courage, she turned to the pastor, asking him to take her to Ernest. As she was standing chatting with her fiancé, she suddenly heard a strangely familiar voice. Her heart pounding, she turned around and saw her father approaching with two men, a military officer in uniform and Giovani!</p>
<p>"My dear," Prince Sheremend said to Angela, "let me introduce you to Colonel Piff; this is my daughter, Angela." Angela, in a daze, said, "Good evening, Colonel."</p>
<p>"I am Lieutenant Severi," Giovani eagerly introduced himself.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Lieutenant," Angela said, struggling to breathe.</p>
<p>"This is my future son-in-law, Sir Trafalgar," the Prince continued the introductions. As everyone bowed respectfully, he added, "Do you remember this rascal, dear? He's the one who crashed into our car that day."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, Father, I remember," Angela said, using all her strength to pretend it was a coincidence.</p>
<p>"Do you like to dance?" Giovani seized the opportunity to press his attack. Under the astonished gazes of those around them, he swept Angela into his arms and whirled her into the ballroom, where the melodious dance music drowned them out. Ernest, seeing this, asked angrily who that was. Piff immediately came to defuse the situation, saying he was a fearless aviator. Prince Sheremend suddenly realized, "So that's it! No wonder he came without an invitation." As the Prince spoke, he watched Angela and Giovani spin out of sight.</p>
