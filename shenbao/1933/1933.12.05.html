<p>時評</p>
<h3>意蘇交歡與逺東形勢明</h3>
<p>蘇聯外長李維洛夫於美蘇恢復國交正式成立之後。轉道東行。即專訪羅馬。與意大利墨索里尼晤談。其眞實内容何如。現在尚未具體公表。惟據一般觀測。墨李二氏七十二分間之談話。大約不外以下兩點。</p>
<p>第一。美蘇復交後。在政治上與意大利並無絲毫衝突。在經濟上尤無妨碍。第二。歐洲形勢緊張巳爲世所共見。蘇德間更欠賀滿。欲圖歐洲之和平。勢不能不改善當前紛紜之局面。故先求蘇意兩國間之諒解。然後再進而打開軍備。縮小會議目前之殭局。則以前所訂之四强公約。或將加入蘇聯。一變而爲五强公約。亦未可知。</p>
<p>以上兩種推測。在第一點殊爲當然中之當然。絶無可以懷疑及推敲之處。且蘇意間。事實上並無不可諒解之仇恨。一切經濟上之利害關係。政治上之權力爭衡。皆相距甚逺。不致有衝突之尖銳化。就第二點而論。在蘇聯在意大利。均各有亟圖解决歐洲問題一面之見解。不過蘇意兩國立塲。旣不相同。方法當然各異。目前之歐羅巴。大别之有凡爾賽體系與非凡爾賽體系及社會主義國家與資本主義國家之相互對立。而利益之不調和。民族間之分。歧政治關係之龐雜。幾爲歷史上空前所未有。蘇聯偏處東歐。雖云地跨歐亞。仍不能不顧忌列國之封鎖。故和平外交之運用。實爲必要意大利地瘠民稠。在北非洲法蘭西爲其强敵。在中歐有德意志及法國之牽制。欲求自由發展。殊多意外之阻碍。是以不能不在國際上尋求足爲意助之友。</p>
<p>以常理推測。蘇聯所高倡之社會主義運動。與意大利之法西斯。怡處於相反對地位絶無調和與諒解之餘隙蘇意間似早應絶交。然而事實昭示。則與一般理論相反。其故何耶。蓋自古以來國與團間。是非曲直。本無定論。利害關聯。亦常有變更。而蘇意兩國在實際的經濟利益上。旣未有若何萬不可調和之因素。即勞工獨裁與資本主義獨裁。亦祇須實利不至相隔太逺。則理論之間隔。最多亦不過筆戰而巳。</p>
<p>是以理論上不能相洽而事實却能互相爲用者。在個人固到處有之。在國家集團利益上。其可能性自必更大。况蘇聯與意大利之於中歐。各有特殊需要。蘇聯在資本主義國家環伺之下。自不能不力求和平。意大利欲在北非洲發展。欲制覇於地中海。亦須在中歐建立適當之國際關係故肯充分與蘇聯親交。以減少東顧之憂。而增加南向之力。此則蘇意兩國所以能暫時將彼此理想社會擱置不提而謀事實之諒解也。</p>
<p>其事實上需要。尤以蘇聯爲甚。今日最爲蘇聯之所顧忌者。厥爲逺東一隅之日本日旣發揮其帝國主義的軍力。以略取一切。現在中東路幾已全部被其刦制。西比利亞。亦將不能以和平方法保持其安全。此點最爲蘇聯旦夕不安者。蓋西歐之紛爭縱甚複雜。然彼此牽制。殆無人敢於發難。蘇意間今能商得妥洽。則此後蘇聯西線自不致輕啓衅端。即西部蘇聯在紛擾局勢中。可以取得平安。惟對逺東。則不能不加强對日之軍事凖備。蘇法交歡。其勢巳顯。蘇意相親。在李墨最近表示。尤爲明晰。其目光所射何在。固無容深諱者也。</p>

<h3>英與國聯合戰線抵制日貨</h3>
<p>（東京）　本日據日本駐英大使松平報告外務省、謂英國下院於前月二十九日關於日英貿易競爭、當於必要時採取斷然處置、而廢除日英通商條約、一致决議、商務總長蘭亞曼亦表贊同、强硬主張確立英國與歐洲各國之聯合戰線、以遏止日貨進口、而表明最近之英國對日態度、保守黨議員福拉當日（二十九日）在下院演說如下、日本商品、對英國貿易行使侵略、英國下院抱有重大之關心、兹對於政府倘因與日本競爭而未能滿足時、政府則爲減少日貨進口計、務宜盡量講求一切有效之手段、而維持英國之市塲、在必要時、可斷然廢棄英日通商恊定云、查此次該院對於日英通商案、經保守自由勞動黨多數贊成將上項議案一致可决、商務總長蘭西曼亦起而解釋如下、日英條約關係上無慮二十八國或至三十國、故對於廢除之利害得失尚有熟慮之必要、且於廢除事前、更須講求一切手段、總之、英國對於日貨進口、或有與歐洲各國聯合戰線之必要、亦未可知、在英國政府目下對於日本、不宜操之過激、以免挑發世界之嗟怨、仍須圖友誼上之共存、使之發生此項印象方爲得策云、（四日日聯電）</p>
<p>意俄合作維持國際和平　改善德俄緊張局勢</p>
<p>日俄關係亦曾談及</p>
<p>蘇俄恢復歐洲地位</p>
<p>羅馬　俄外長李維諾夫與意首相墨索里尼晤談後、今日發表公報、謂此次談話、凡有危及世界和平之問題、皆討論及之、另據確息、俄意兩國對於國際問題之意見、完全一致、故其結果、兩國在外交方面必將合作、蓋兩國均以和平爲宗旨也、現聞意方决定致力改善德俄兩國間緊張之關係、意首相墨索里尼或將向德總理希特勒設法勸告云、俄當局極願與德表示好感、德國在蘇俄境内有極大之利益、故德國或將立即接受俄方之善意、結果或將定促成德俄兩國成立互不侵犯條約、與俄與其鄰近諸國簽定者同、如此則蘇俄可恢復其以前在歐洲之地位、同時可設法由意俄兩國居中斡旋、使德法兩國言歸於好、其第二步辦法、爲將擔保歐洲和平之四强公約擴爲五强公約、使蘇俄加入、但此說爲期尚刊、現信李墨二民談話時、亦曾談及日俄關係緊張之問題、討論結果如何、尚未明瞭、俄意兩國之互不侵犯條約、中有訂約國於與其他國家訂立商約時、不得有損及與約國商業利益之條文、職此之故、最近俄美之恊定、並未損及意國商業利益、聞李維諾夫現隨時以電話與史達林接談、李氏對於此次與墨索里尼會晤之結果、頗爲滿意、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　意相墨索里尼與蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫、秉培植兩圍友誼之精神、今日繼續在威尼斯宮晤談、所談内容雖無公報發表、據聞許多國際性質之問題、如軍縮·經濟條約·國聯改組等、莫不列入討論範圍、而於直接影響兩國之問題尤爲注重、此外並共同研究有無按照意俄友好條約之精神、改善世界政治狀况之可能性、至意俄友好條約、兩人巳允早日互換批准文書云、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>羅馬　意皇今晨接見俄外長李維諾夫、作十五分鐘談話、衆信李氏昨與墨索里尼晤談時、必言及日本、李氏定以蘇俄深慮日本在逺東之帝國主義爲言、墨索里尼除言及日本經濟勢力膨脹外、從未表示其對日之態度、在李氏到意以前之兩星期中、意國常有論文、指陳日本商業在歐侵略之危害、並勸歐洲一致對付之、（四日路透電）</p>
<h3>法人深表懷疑</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　法人對於俄外長李維諾夫赴意晤墨索里尼之舉、深表懷疑、認二人談話必有所企圖、有人認爲因法政府屢次改組、致令法國在外交方面不能採取有力行動、致使李維諾夫認羅馬較巴黎便於談判、殊表遺憾云、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　日報名記者聖蒲里斯評論、謂「俄國深恐德國之重整軍備、而意國亦斷不主張德國之整軍經武、且俄意兩國均有强大之民衆組織、如他國常備軍隊裁减以後、則此種民衆組織之實力、將益見增强、此又爲兩國同具之情形、俄意兩國對於軍縮準備工作之繼續、所以特加重視者、職是故也、然意大利以扶植德國爲保持中歐均勢之一要素、且意國之巴爾幹政策在接近保加利亞、反之、蘇俄對希特勒之德國猜忌殊甚、在巴爾幹半島又竭力拉攏小恊商各國與土耳其、而小恊商與土耳其則方謀使保加利亞陷於孤立之地位、由此則意俄兩國觀點、實未能盡同、墨索里尼殆必苦心經營、方能知莫斯科用意所在、而與之合作也、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　晨報駐羅馬訪員電稱、蘇俄外委李維諾夫與意相墨索里尼談話之主要理由、似限於調和德國與蘇俄之關係、自意大利政府觀之、此爲軍縮問題主要之一點、德日兩國均傾向用武者、蘇俄介於兩大之間、故其政策近於舊日之均勢主義、而不以意大利向來所主張之國際合作主義爲重、但蘇俄在德國方面之安全、若能加以保障、則其對於軍縮之見地、至少對於歐洲軍縮之見地、必將改變、墨索里尼即擬本此意義、勸導蘇俄使其理解、此種任務自然困難、因德俄兩國不獨政治制度根本不同、即利益情緒亦均相反也、然由意大利言之、此種斡旋任務、頗有一試之價值、意大利果能調解德俄兩國意見、則軍縮問題自易按照意大利主張而逐漸予以解决、至法德兩國接近一層如能實現、則意大利對於德俄兩國之斡旋任務、更覺易於着手云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>歐洲趨向和平　似未忘大戰痛苦　德奥合併運動延擱</h3>
<p>（紐約）　美國富豪卡耐奇所設國際和平基金駐歐辦事處副主任柏勃柯克僑歐數載現返美國、最近在紐約泰晤士報撰一重要之長文、略謂彼在歐洲親自考查之結果、深覺舊大陸距離大戰爆發之時期</p>
<p>尚屬遥逺、一般自歐洲返美者多以爲戰爭近在目前、實屬不確蓋在歐洲雖有種種勢力、以戰爭爲有利可圖、正在煽動戰爭、但各國民衆之和平勢力、足以克服此種戰爭勢力而有餘、就事實論之、上次大戰所造成之恐怖與貧困、使人人咸有戒心、至今未能忘懷、故反對戰爭之聲勢猶甚普遍而廣大、巴爾幹半島諸國現正進行組織、以避免發生衝突、土耳其明白表示其和平之意向、故與各鄰國訂結各種經濟政治恊定、就各種途徑以謀合作、至於德奥合併運動現巳延擱、必俟德奥兩國間危機消滅、簽訂經濟友好條約後、方可再事進行、法國爲歐洲政治之中心、然其政府絶不穩固、内閣迭經更易、此則以法國政府之外交政策、能始終代表法團和平主義之輿論、而其財政政策則不能代表輿論故也、雖然、故外長白里安之遺教、對於法國輿論有恒久不變之影響、故法國對外、常以維持和平爲唯一之方針、今必使英法意三國、於緩急之際、始終密切合作、則法德間之恊定方乃有成云、結論則謂、「大戰以後任何時期、吾人接近和平之目標未有能如今日者、此吾人所可希望、所可徵信者也云云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日本擴充海軍　要求變更五五三比率　航空隊增至三十九隊</h3>
<p>（東京）　海軍省發言人今日向路透代表聲稱、海軍預算日金六七０·０００·０００元、雖己減至四四九·０００·０００元、然此數仍足敷照原定計畫實施第二補充程序、惟將來或尚需追加經費、又謂按照程序所擬造之艦、有每艘八千五百噸之巡洋艦兩艘、每艘萬噸之飛機母艦兩艘、埋雷艦一艘、各式驅逐艦十四艘、各式潛艇四艘、運油艦一艘、修理艦一艘、潛艇母艦一艘、魚雷艇四艘、潛行追逐艦四艘云、至於飛機母艦、聞日本按約僅得續造一萬二千噸、所擬建造之此艦兩艘、其一將代現有之七四七０噸之一艘、該艦於是將加拆毁、除此項新建造之諸艦外、尚擬撥七千五百萬元改造戰艦兩艘、飛機母艦兩艘、巡洋艦兩艘、改造之戰艦且將升高其砲位、又海軍之航空隊、亦將增加八分隊、按第一次補充程序、列有自一九三一至三七年將海軍航空隊由十七增至二十九分隊之經費、並另撥二千萬元、以供於一九三五至三八年增加兩分隊之用、故至一九三八年四月、日本共有海軍航空隊三十一分隊、今第二補充程序擬於一九三四至三八年續增八分隊、如此項計畫果見實施、則至一九三八年春、日本所有海軍航空隊不下三十九分隊、此外尚有飛機母艦與其他軍艦所載之飛機焉、（四日路透電）</p>

<h3>日海軍省主張變更現行比率</h3>
<p>（東京）　美國海軍部長史璜生之海軍報告、主張積極政策、充實軍力、日本海軍省當局對此發表如下非公式意見、「美國在倫敦條約規定之範圍内、實行建艦計劃、爲條約上應當之權利、非他國任意批評之事然其報告書中、主張維持美英日有五三之現行比率、日本海軍斷難同意此說、大角海相曾於九月十三日在美國各報發表之聲明書中、己經明瞭說明、即軍備之縮减、以限制戰鬥力與保障安全　　可分　之問題、且海軍軍縮、依存於因　　　　　　爲條約受永久的束縛、日本簽字倫敦條約之用意、爲人類之福祉、且附有條件、華盛頓條約成立後經十二年、現在國際情形與當時完全不同、故該條約對於日本之安全、巳不適當、現在軍縮條約之規定、是否最合理的且經濟的、頗可疑問、總之、日本不滿意現行比數、主張在下次軍縮會議變改此比數也、（四日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日本海軍之第二次補充計劃、頗爲世界各國注目、此項計劃將於一九三六年完成、其時日美兩國海軍力之比較如次</p>

<h3>糧食恐慌</h3>
<p>閩省糧食生產、向來供不敷求、米麥兩項、均須仰給產米各省供給、自政局變動後、閩海各口、突被中央海軍封鎖、以致米與麵粉來源、遂告斷絶、因此閩市食糧售價飛漲、一星期中、白米每擔漲起三海四元、切麵每斤飛漲五六百文、如果上各外商輪船再無米及麵粉運閩、則售價勢非再行抬高不可、故福州民心、對於糧食一層、己慌亂萬狀、（日日社）</p>

<h3>莫德惠王家楨昨日回國抵滬　張學良正候輪返國　莫在滬稍留即晋京</h3>
<p>我國前派赴蘇俄出席中蘇會議全權代表莫德惠、自九一八後、即由莫斯科赴德養疴、未幾轉往意京羅馬、小住經年、昨日下午四時、莫氏偕其夫人等、由歐乘意郵船康脫盧梭輪返國抵滬、同來者、尚有前外交部次長王家楨·及其眷屬等、莫等在滬稍作休息後即晋京、向中央報告一切、然後再行北上、各情分誌如次、</p>
<h3>抵滬情形</h3>
<p>莫氏於十月十日、偕夫人隨員及前任外交次長王家楨、張學良秘書李應超夫婦等五人同乘意輪康脫盧梭號離歐回國、於昨日下午四時許抵滬、該輪停泊浦東其昌碼頭、外部特派駐滬辦事處科長趙鐵章、會同吳市長代表秘書唐士煊、前往碼頭歡迎、五時、在江海關碼頭上岸、分返旅次、李應超夫婦則於一日抵港後、即返粤省親、並未來滬、</p>
<h3>久病新愈</h3>
<p>莫氏於抵滬後、曾向記者發表一簡單談話、謂旅歐逾四載、本擬早日回國、因身體不適、乃於前年離俄至德養病、約歷半年、旋復赴意休息、亦達半載、最近因病略愈、遂離歐回國、惟精神仍欠佳、加以途中舟車轉折、到滬後尚感昏眩、故亦未接見任何賓客、</p>
<h3>入京赴津</h3>
<p>在意時曾與張漢卿氏會晤於羅馬、張近在歐精神煥發、身體亦較前爲强壯、現張氏頗有意回國、但何時可離歐、須視船期而定、故一月内能否離歐、不得而知、本人在滬擬有三五日休息、然後再入京、並擬轉赴華北一行、困本人眷屬現尚在天津也云云、</p>
<h3>孫科再談閩事　閩省實力不滿三師　中央軍在浙邊巖防</h3>
<p>中央社云、據香港電傳、粤省當局、曾於一日電京、提出五項條件、調解閩變等說、中央社記者昨晨特以此詢諸立法院長孫科於其寓所、據談如次、</p>
<h3>粤方調解未有所聞</h3>
<p>關於粤省當局、爲調解閩變、於一日電京、提出五項條件等說、本人未有所聞、據說、香港報紙亦有此項消息刋載、究屬事之有無、本人因己於三十日晚離京來滬、故無從知悉、但信决非事實、</p>
<h3>閩方實力不滿三師</h3>
<p>閩省叛變、純係陳銘樞一人主張、不惜因一人之私見、犧牲極有光榮之十九路軍隊、至十九路軍實力、雖自開閩後、曾增編三師、但均係新軍、全無戰鬥力、其精銳部隊、區壽年部曾於剿共時犧牲過半、並悉有三團之衆、全軍覆没、故該軍人數、雖號稱五六萬、然能戰者不滿三師、該省與贛匪雖已締結盟約、但在贛邊亦須留駐一部份隊伍、則决無實力向外進展、至西南當局爲預防該軍衝入、巳在粤邊嚴加防範、駐軍已達五師以上、至於中央軍在浙邊者、己有八萬之衆、故討伐一旦開始、預期一個月内可以解决、蓋十九路軍中頗有不滿於陳等所爲、戰事爆發、必有一部份軍隊歸附中央、可斷言也、所以陳銘樞之所爲、實屬至愚、自甘爲陳炯明第二也、</p>
<h3>四中全會准期舉行</h3>
<p>四中全省、己定本月二十日、在京舉行、該會中所討論案件極多、凡關於禦外患平内亂、以及整理各省行政事宜、均將提交該會中討論、至於外傳中央討伐閩省命令、將於該會中通過發表、殊非事實、因政府本有權討伐任何叛逆也、</p>
<h3>經委會設兩辦事處</h3>
<p>全國經濟委員會爲便利推行各省會務起見、决在西北及江西兩地、分設辦事處、西北辦事處决設西安、專辦西北各省建設事宜、如救濟農村及水利事業等等、江西辦事處地址尚未决定、惟該省匪區次第收復後、農村之救濟以及百業之待舉、實爲第一急務、故不久即可設立、至於糧食統制委員會之成立、因委員人選、尚未完全解决、尚未定確期、且糧食進行統制、需欵更鉅、故非有鉅欵、不能進行、</p>
<h3>起草憲法年初可竣</h3>
<p>立法院起草憲法、已由憲法起草委員會加緊進行、預定明年一月可以告竣、四月間可以公佈草案、憲法草案、公佈後、當徵求全國各界意見、加以修改、然後提交民國二十四年四月間之國民大會中通過頒布云云、</p>
<p>孫科·朱家驊·馬超俊·劉瑞恒·鄒琳·焦易堂等、昨晚乘夜快車晋京、</p>
<h3>滬閩電報暢通　足證暫無戰事</h3>
<p>中央社云、自閩變發生後、滬閩間航業、因中央有封銷閩海口之舉、致受影響、而滬閩間電報、爲流通滬閩間消息之唯一來源、故各方對此頗爲注意、前數日并於浙閩交界之廿八都地方、因電桿被風吹折、與電話線交線、以致一時發生窒碍、當經該段工務員修復、現已照常通行、中央社記者、特往交通部上海電報局訪詢該局業務長華士鑑、據談如次、</p>
<h3>吹折電桿軍事無關</h3>
<p>二日晚八時、於浙閩交界二十八圖地方、因電桿折斷發生交線、障碍通報、於是外間發生謡言、按此次所以有電桿折斷之事、因該處近有建築長途汽車路、故沿路電桿、有需移動者、臨時架以木桿經巨風過境、或以臨時木桿裝置未堅、爲其吹折、與軍事毫無關係、現巳飭工修復、照常通報矣、</p>
<h3>滬閩電報較前忙碌</h3>
<p>本局因鑒於目前時局緊張之際、該線關係甚大、故已通知該線趙工程長、特飭各段巡線員、隨時加以注意、且自閩變以後、滬閩間收發電報、較前更形忙碌、大概每日滬地發出者、有四百餘張、接到閩方電報、亦有三百餘張、在此時局緊張、人心惶惶之時、更應加意保護、以免發生障碍、而起外界之不安、至於在閩省方面之電報分局、因該處均係與十九路軍方面有關係者、故仍能照常供職、並無接收或更迭之事、矧本局爲營業機關、雖有政治變化、但亦不致影響本局之業務、</p>
<h3>封鎖閩電實非確詞</h3>
<p>關於外傳浙閩間發生戰事之說、直至此刻、未能證實、蓋閩浙發生戰事、本局滬閩間所經浙閩交界處之電線、必受影響、但按目前情形、兩方通報、仍交往無阻、至於外傳交通部將有封銷閩省電報之說、實非確詞、本局從未接到交通部是項訓令、足見其無稽也、</p>
<h3>天廚號機配件昨巳由德運滬　中央派貝勒工程師來滬裝配</h3>
<p>天廚味精廠獨捐容克斯式全金屬戰鬥機、於本年七月十四日、賣方在未交貨以前、作初次試飛時、因駕駛員技術平庸、致下降時、將推進機及油箱撞損、經天廚廠數度向經售該機禪臣洋行交涉、復經中央航空學校工廠廠長王柏修、從中斡旋、賣方亦爲信用關係、允將損毁部份、全部拆換、並願將在北平求售、全金屬五零式教練機、無條件交付天廚廠、以爲賠償、此項配件、係由意大利郵船公司之「康特盧梭」號郵船承儎、該船已於昨日下午三時半進口、至裝配手續、昨據天廚廠方君語華東社記者、因主要機件如發動機等、完全無損、故祇須四五日之工作、即可竣事、所到配件、計有推進機·油箱·輪盤·鋼中皮·等件、至裝配人物、已由中央航空學校工廠·派定德籍工程司貝勒（譯音）君來滬、負責裝配、貝氏明後日即可由京抵此、一俟到滬後、即須將該機全部拆卸擦油、因工作需時、故命名典禮、十五日或不及舉行、在北平教練機、航空學校亦於前日去電、催即駕以駛飛滬云、</p>

<h3>招商局江安輪領江郭少衡在船自殺　左手用刀自刎而死　自殺原因或由經濟</h3>
<p>招商局長江班江安輪、星其六由漢返滬、原定本日晨開行、詎昨日船内之領江郭少衡、突然自殺、而原因不明、並無遺書等情亟將此事狀况、查明如下、</p>
<h3>自殺狀况</h3>
<p>招商局之江安輪、係長江綫内之頭等船、故開星期一四正班者、此次由漢來滬、於星期六進口、船泊金利源碼頭、該輪領江郭少衡、係廣東人、年四十九歳、在該輪任職已十餘年、並無過失、向來船到後、渠須回家（在海寗路同昌路）一次、故星期日仍到船上居住、而且毫氣異狀、至昨日早晨九時、該領江尚不起身、郭之侍役奚金龍、頗以爲異、蓋郭平日在七時卽須起身也、至九時許、該西崽敲門呌喚、而房内絶無聲息、奚金龍遂推門而入、欲喚其起身、詎料房門甫開、見郭領江已臥於血泊之中、業已身死、血流滿床、西崽奚金龍、急報船主問西崽、同往察看、</p>
<h3>報告水警</h3>
<p>郭領江之臥室、卽在船主臥室之後、各西崽得此驚報後、紛紛趨前觀看、見郭巳無氣息、身子挺臥在床、因身體肥大、血流四溢、各西崽急報船主大副、及二領江陳廷恩等同往視察、當時各船員議定立卽縣旗召水警到來、再定辦法、九時三刻、水巡捕趕到、經船員報告領江自殺情事、而水巡捕乃歸報本隊、並往檢疫處請醫生到船、檢騐死者之屍體及其自殺之狀况、一面派警在船看守、</p>
<h3>醫官檢騐</h3>
<p>至十一時左右騐疫處醫生到來、會同船主水警等、到領江臥室内檢騐、發見死者係用極鋒利之洋刀一柄、（如大菜刀一式無二）用左手在頸自刎、着刀處創深約寸許、自耳際下頸項起、至喉管爲止、頸項右側之血管盡斷、而喉管轉未割斷、大致流血過多、而致死亡、檢騐時洋刀仍置在胸腹之間、左手尚灣曲、如執刀自刎狀、右手下垂、死者身着衛生衣褲、赤足、此外别無傷痕、</p>
<h3>尸體移出</h3>
<p>醫生檢騐結果、斷明出於自殺無疑、該尸體當經水警等議定送往南市救生局、其時招商總局亦得報、由船務科主任趙雲台委派錢樹銘到船視察、並調查此事之眞相、當時先將郭之尸體從臥室舁出後、吊下小輪、送往南市同仁輔元局、準備通知其家屬、備棺收殮、</p>
<h3>檢查遺物</h3>
<p>此案發生以後、關於郭之自殺究因何事、均皆不知、平日謹愼從公、目無精神病態、而此次到滬回家及重到船上、狀仍快樂、何故自殺、成爲疑問、當時水巡捕在臥房内搜檢、僅發現致黄鳳岐之信一件、（黄前亦在招商做事）信内所言、係委托其向閘北租屋、而忽又回絶其不必往租者、此外一無字跡、該信由水警取去、午後水警並傳黄鳳岐到局詢問、又將值房西崽奚金龍傳去訊問、均言不知何事、</p>
<h3>派定領江</h3>
<p>陳船主對郭之自殺頗爲痛心、蓋郭任事十餘年、從未出過事變、陳船主除將此事陳報總局外、又請趙科長雲台亦派一人、接代領江之職、午後經局方派定預備領江陳桐輝接替、據陳船主告記者、郭之自殺、事前毫無異狀、原因何在、實難推測、郭有一妻五子、月薪一百八十元、但其自殺後、臥房内無一錢餘留、或者因經濟壓迫而生厭世之心、亦未可知、陳船主又言郭之死、渠不啻傷去一臂、故出事以後、心中感痛甚深、言時唏嘘下淚、</p>
<h3>家屬收殮</h3>
<p>郭之家屬、住在海寗路、昨經陳船主向局代領薪金後、並派一人、恊辦喪務、因郭之五子、最大者祇十五歳也、其棺木將暫寄廣肇山莊、一方面擬呈請局内、照定例發給卹金、以資贍養遺族、</p>

<h3>合作</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>牡牡雖好全仗緑葉扶持。—說得現代化些兒，就是「歙和。一人類的吃喝，也是如此。從鷄口一直到牛後，中間經過五臟廟，六腑堂，你消我化，這才能風調雨順，身泰心安，若有某一部分，實行不合作，那不來一個大便燥結，便來一個拖白曳黄，不是當要的。</p>
<p>推而至於家庭，也非「合作不可。丈夫說妻子整天躱在家裏，不曉得到外面去奔走，而賭着氣，辭著生意不幹了，那凖會打着饑荒，活活地餓死。妻子若說丈夫在外面服務了，把燒飯，冲茶，抱孩子的工作都推在妻子身上而不服氣，發起脾氣來，不管了，這準也會把家庭毁滅掉的。</p>
<p>國家的存在，也是如此。中央政府的存在，就靠着各地方政府的支持。而各地方政府的存在，也有賴於中央政府的維護。其組織的相互關係，猶如一列火車之與火車頭。一列火車，不配上一個車頭，老是停在軌道上，客無用處。一個火車頭不拖着客車貨車，獨個兒的開來開去，似乎也没甚意義。中央政府不要地方政府，自然是成了一個光桿火車頭，地方政府不要中央，也和没有車頭的火車，没甚分别。</p>
<p>國際聯盟的不能制裁强暴，伸張公理，也就因不能得到會員各國的合作。「共存共榮」，這雖是一句聽膩了的老調，可是在這一句老調的本身上看來，確是一句至理明言，而更其是在航行於驚濤駭浪中的同舟者，應當在「共存共榮」的觀念之下，努力合作。否則準會一古腦兒倒下海去，同歸於盡。</p>
<h3>片面的人生</h3>
<p>— 除紅霞</p>
<p>爲了生活的問題，在一條修長的運河堤上，每天朝晚都要奔走七八里的來回，岸旁的樹木花草，茅屋裏的人們，不論是男，女，老，少，經了這半年來的想見，居然都相識了。</p>
<p>近來，北風緊緊的吹了幾天，江北究竟不比江南的温和，氣候巳經突變了。風巳像尖刀般的刺着皮膚，陽光已黯淡得無力了，在晨間，在黄昏，我都在這黄沙撲面的堤上獨行着。</p>
<p>自前天起，在堤旁，發現了許多的新朋友，他們，是像燕子般的，按着節氣遷移着，每年都在北風凛烈中，拖兒帶女的到來，他們的家鄉，是逺在山東省，他們的家屋非常的簡單，一輛獨輪車就可把所有的東西推了來，連房屋都在上面，到了長堤上，選擇一處向陽的地方，一張長約八尺寛約五尺的長方形的蘆蓆，圈成了一個半圓形，四邊拿樹枝釘牢了，這就是他們的住宅，一家大小都住在裏面，什麽大廳，堂屋，房間，廚房，……都混合爲一，住宅的大門，只夠兩歳的小孩來往，大一點的孩子進出就要彎腰了，成人當然必須要爬才能進出。</p>
<p>他們的職業，男的是做泥人子，小呌呌，……一類小孩的玩具，女的和小孩是做乞討的生活，他們的衣履，破爛得會令人疑猜不是整塊的布，而是一根根的繩子結合成功的。他們的生活，是山芋，胡萊菔，……一類的雜糧，唉，他們，……</p>
<p>自從他們的到來，我每天走在這修長而黄沙撲面的運河堤上，我都忘記了是在人間走着，好像是走在地獄裏似的。</p>
<h3>磨荳腐者</h3>
<p>— 公詒</p>
<p>灰色的天，没有月，也没有星，祇有無力的燈光從破門洞裏射來。</p>
<p>一個老頭兒獨自的坐在磨邊，吱吱咕咕的在磨着黄荳。</p>
<p>這老頭兒頭上點點的汗珠滴下來，和磨子裏迸出的荳漿一樣。</p>
<p>各處傳來的鼻鼾聲，響應着老頭兒喘急的呼吸聲，似乎是凑着兩種不同的音樂。</p>
<p>灰色的天，没有月，也没有星，祇有無力的燈光從破門洞裏射出來。</p>
<h3>談談自來水筆</h3>
<p>— 煥然</p>
<p>自來水筆，不是巳經成爲目下人們，服飾上的應有點綴品了麽？</p>
<p>假如你到上海搭電車，坐定以後，不但有五光十色的自來水筆，在你左右顧盼之間，就是你身上如果有了一枝，還要當心那偷兒來摸索。</p>
<p>現代的蜜絲脫和蜜絲，當彼此相見恨晚，初談戀愛的關頭，爲求對方歡心起見，常常跑到××公司文房部裏去，選購那外國名廠出品，數十元一枝最華麗的自來水筆，送給與伊，作爲他和伊的見面禮。因爲外國名廠出品，加上船費關稅和店舖開支，一齊計算起來，才有這昻貴的代價，用了這昻貴代價，方足表示他的崇敬，得到伊的眞愛。</p>
<p>逺涉重洋，回到祖國，鍍有金色的朋友們，他那西裝口袋裏，所掛的自來水筆，這不消說，當然是從住在國名廠裏，親自選購而來。就是那些帶有貴族色彩，未出國門的大學士，以及在機關供職，洋行服務的一般摩登哥兒，誰人不是用的道地外國貨。你如提起質問，包他不遲疑的立刻答覆，不是說外國貨經久耐用，就是說逺在五年以前所購買的舊東西啊。</p>
<p>至於價廉特美的國貨，關勒銘自來水，幾多半是在中小學級的人們衣襟上發現，這是不是眞爲正愛國心所驅使，還是程度上關係，尚未達到經濟的充份供結　。</p>
<h3>笑</h3>
<p>— 棲鳳樓主</p>
<p>觀察現在社會和國家的現狀，祇有哭的分兒，從那裏笑得出來？但是話又說回來了，哭是對於事實無補的，不若振作精神，破涕爲笑，以謀所以挽救之計，方爲上策，不過國家大事，無庸我們小百姓顧問，並且也無權顧問，那末，我來談談普通社會上各種的笑三四歳的小孩，在慈母的懷抱中，他的小心靈中，偶然感到不適意，不快樂，就張開了小口，哇哇的哭個不休，這時你將香而且甜的糖，送進他的小嘴裏，不久，他就止哭了，而且露出了笑意來，這笑是天眞的是最自然最純潔的笑</p>
<p>黄包車夫氣喘吁吁的，將乘客拉到目的地，緩緩的將車子停了下來，不住的拉着號衣，揩拭着滿頭的汗珠，待乘客大模大樣的下了車，他就屏息以待，站在一旁等候着勞苦奔波的代價，－車錢，乘機哀懇道：「先生，請你多給幾個銅板」，這時他枯黄的面龐上，裝出了一絲笑容，這是可憐而不自然的笑。</p>
<p>當他和伊由初步的友誼，而走進第二步的戀愛之途，這時期自然是開情花結愛果的總關鍵，所以一切的舉動，都要小心翼翼的，並須謀相當的餽貽，以助長愛的萌芽，最足耐人尋味的，便是並肩坐在幽蒨的緣隂深處，他給伊輕輕的在柔荑上套上一隻鑽戒，伊的粉頰上呈露了一層微霞，暈出一絲淺笑來，這應該是甜蜜的，美麗的笑吧？</p>
<p>至於那些青樓的千金買笑，和屬員對於上司，店員對於經理的陪笑，以及酗酒者狂笑，瘋顚者痴笑＾等等，這些都是虚僞，勉强，刺激的笑，却早失去笑的眞義了。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十九回　欲卽欲離同車憶往事　半哭半笑倚枕病殘秋</p>
<p>記得去年這個時候，和積之認識了半年多，感情也有了，曾應了他的約會，到香山去偷着過一次紅葉。紅葉現在是又出現了，這過去的情事，却是再也想不到了。院子裏正擺着十來盆菊花，前兩天經過了一塲秋雨，現在共的菊花，變成了赭色，粉紅的菊花，變成了慘白色，紅的菊花，變成了焦灰色，站在屋檐邊，閑看了這些菊花出神，覺得那枯萎的顏色，將花瓣翻轉過去，頂出花心來，似乎它告訴人在這世界上，巳經是爲日無多了。江氏正由趙翁那邊，拿了一疊鈔票來，逺逺的就舉了起來，讓桂枝看着道：這是亦們老爺子給的三十塊錢，你收着罷，又可以添幾件衣服了。桂枝皺了雙眉，正想和母親說一句不高興的話，忽然想到母親說的是趙家的事，在接錢的時候，若說了不好聽的話，母親會生起疑心來的。於是忽然兩眉一展，笑了起來道：多謝老爺子了，若是這樣每次分咱們三十塊四十塊的，到了明年這個時候，要做兩箱子衣服了。江氏道：這倒想賴到明年這個時候去呢，可是也要人家願意呀。佳枝看到母親那種歡喜不過的樣子，自己怎好掃他的興致，也就微微的對他笑着。江氏進房收錢去了，桂枝依然在院子裏徘徊。恰是天上起一些魚鱗雲，將太陽的光，重重的遮住。空中隂沉，在盆裏摇擺着，决不是夏天擺石榴花那種景象了。（註：舊都人家，十有八九，院中必置盆景，殊不論貧富。花值亦廉，若接根菊花，一元可購三四十盆也。）（二五九）</p>

<h3>康橋畫展追記</h3>
<p>— 西神</p>
<p>吾友變吷庵黄匑庵陳甘簃結康橋書畫社於滬西，康橋者，吷庵之所居也，余常過其忍古樓，觀所作畫品。吷庵游太華歸，作三丈餘長卷，自洛陽達華隂，凡途中所見，悉納卷中，三日面成，有類吳道子寫嘉陵江圖，不假粉本，並記於心，得機迅手辣之妙。太華崇高，昔人皆不作長卷，吷庵亦另有尺二册子，分圖西谷以上至三峯景物，洛陽龍門爲伊水入黄之道，石闕與香山對峙，北魏以來，雕刻佛像，達十萬餘，吷庵繪圖凡四易其稿，前三本皆己爲愛者以金易去，樓中所存，乃第四本，近人能作北派山水者實罕，畫家非不北遊，寫之而似者，當以吷庵爲最。吷庵寄家青島，每歳伏日，輙歸避暑。今歳自青島歸，嘗出勞頂圖見示，勞山自古罕見文人題詠，畫者尤少，匑庵寫濱海山狀，極得海天旭日之遺意。蓋二君畫筆，均類明以前高手，出於天性，其所作諸圖，實軼出四王吳惲範圍，不爲一代風氣所缚，靈妙超古，别具創造之力，不從紙絹相承而來也。西畫東來，油畫水彩諸法，頗爲畫家所採取，然西法重在寫眞，尺寸繩墨，不容絲毫相背，所寫面積，祇如攝影鏡頭所得，而攝影名家所取光影，極重自然，今之學西畫者，殆不知自然之妙，在尺寸繩墨之中，而亦在尺寸繩墨之外，用死法求之，必不可得，故攝影藝術所達之點，西畫家實不能到。於是歐美名畫家頗欲研究東方畫術，以變革其法，吾國畫術以不死之氣，不俗之韵，運用筆墨，咫尺千里，雖不中繩墨，見者宛然如游圖中，所謂畫外有畫，空處有畫，均爲神妙之跡，則又超過攝影鏡頭所達自然之點也。惟近今畫家，專重寫意，離去形似太逺，則又失之過偏，故國畫又宜採取西法之長，兼重繩墨，竊謂二君畫法，深得此意。六朝畫人物，得西蕃畫佛之意而一變，然非俗手所能，今西畫東來，應如何採取其長，使寫實寫意二者，融合而一，開藝術界之新紀錄，吾竊有望於二君也。前者康橋書畫社在湖社展覽，余於百忙之中，抽暇一往參觀，惜吷庵所寫華山龍門諸圖，均未與陳列，然吷庵所作華山蒼龍嶺天目雲海花塢白雲堆粤東清逺峽鄧尉虎山橋，匑庵所作勞山玉鱗口柳樹臺濟南大明湖，及兩君各作一幅勞山華樓峯，均在壁上。次日爲友人談之，將往參觀，不料先夕閉幕，皆以未及一覩，相與怏怏，詢之二君，知已大半爲人購去，又徐君紹周，亦康橋畫友，近就湖南大學之聘，不在滬，其所作荆溪善卷洞圖，亦實地寫景，陳君甘簃爲正風文學院舊教授，所作篆隸眞行屏聯，神完氣王，其先代以善書名者，有玉方子鶴諸先生，淵源於家學者深，故其根底特厚，天才横溢，匪恒人所易及也。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>我也談</h3>
<p>— 李後主何如</p>
<p>前幾天，在自由談裡看到一篇關於李後主的者據文章，現在，我就來一點關於李後主的批評罷。</p>
<p>李後主這位曲子皇帝，二十年來被一般研究詞學的人捧得至高無上了，實則並值不得怎樣恭維。倘若他不是生在五代，不是皇帝，不是立國江南，不是結果亡國，而且詞不是當時新起的一種貴族文學，正和他的生活相適應，他也會作不出那樣的詞。雖然，我並不否認作者個人的先天遺傳也有相當的關係。</p>
<p>詞在五代，究竟是怎麽一種性質的玩意兒呢？祇要我們讀過花間集，牘過歐隔炯的花間集叙，就會知道詞和南朝樂府，宮體詩，是同性質的東西，都適應著當時統治階級貴族官僚以及智　分子生活上的要求，而表現了他們的姿態。他們在社會上憑藉了自己優越的地位，特殊的權利，世間上一切可能的幸福都得享受·醇酒，婦人，耿唱，三者諧和酣美的享樂，正是他們支配生活的階級所要求的。詞，這東西恰出於他們那一階級之手，有花間集的作者可證。恰以他們那種醇酒婦人歌唱的生活爲其内容，而歌奏於宮廷北里，綺筵繡幌，滿足他們那一階級生活上的要求，有花間集的作品可證。他們這樣貪圖瞬間的享樂，帶著極濃厚的感傷或頽廢的氣分，這是他們那一階級生在五代那樣興亡倐忽，禍變無常的狀態裏而無可如何的。</p>
<p>陸游花間集跋云：「斯時天下岌岌，士大夫乃流宕如此，或者出於無聊。」他說出於無聊，那是不算怎麽錯的·不過這　時候，流蕩無聊的不僅士大夫，君主亦復如此，可以說是包括統治階級的全部。李後主正是這種流蕩無聊的君主之一。自唐昭宗，後唐莊宗，以及前蜀王衍，後蜀孟昶，何嘗不是酣歌恒舞，沈涵聲色的君主？又何當不會作詞？豈僅南唐中主後主而己哉？總之，我們要記住五代時候的統治階級君主臣僚，大都是過的醇酒婦人歌唱的生活，酣姿京樂的生活，這樣纔可以去論南唐李後主的詞。</p>
<p>後主詞的好處在那里呢？祇因詞本是統治階級君主臣僚以及有閒的智識分子尋開心的曲子，到了亡國以後的李後主，他的詞成了發憤告哀的一種新體詩，很有幾首能夠引起讀者同情的共鳴，所以他就成爲了不起的詞人了。</p>
<h3>方巖紀靜（續）</h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>方巖附近的山，都是絶壁陡起，高二三百丈，面積周圍三五里至六七里不等。而峯頂與峯脚，面積無大差異，形或上或圓，絶似碩大的撑天賀柱。峯巖頂上，又都是平地，林木叢叢，簇生如髮。峯的腰　，祇是一層一層的沙石巖壁，可望而不可登。間有瀑布奔流，奇樹突現，自朝至暮，因日光風雨之移易，形狀景象，也千變萬化，捉摸不定，山之偉觀，到此大約是可以說得己竣極頂了罷？</p>
<p>從前看中國畫裏的奇巖絶壁，皺法皺疊，蒼勁雄偉，到不可思議的地步，現在到了方巖，向各山略一舉目，纔知道南宗北派的畫山點石，都還有未到之處。在學校裏初學英文的時候，讀到那一位美國清教作家何桑的大石面一篇短篇，頗生異想，身到方巖，方知年幼時的少見多怪，像那篇小說裏所寫的大石面，在這附近眞不知有多多少少。我不曾到過埃及，不知沙漠中的Ｓphinx比起這些巖面來，又該是誰兄誰弟。尤其是天造地設，清函岑寂到令人毛髮悚然的一區境界，是方巖北面相去約二三里地的壽山下五峰書院所在的地方。</p>
<p>北面數峯，逺近環拱，至西面而南偏，絶壁千丈，成了一條上突下縮的倒覆危牆。危墻腰下，離地約二三丈的地方，墻脚忽而不見，形成大洞，似巨怪之張口，口腔上下，都是石壁，五峰書院，麗澤祠，學易齋，就建築在這巨口的上下顎之間，不施椽瓦，而風雨莫及，</p>
<p>冬暖夏凉，而紅塵不到。更奇峭者，就是這絶壁的忽而向東南的一折，遞進而突起了固厚，瀑布，桃花，覆釜，鷄鳴的五個奇峯。峯峯都高大似方巖，而形狀顏色，各不相同。立在五峯書院的樓上，只聽得見四圍飛瀑的清音，仰視天小，鳥飛不渡，對視五峯，青紫無言，向東展望，略見白雲逺樹，浮漾在楔形闊處的空中。一種幽靜，清新，偉大的感覺，自然而然的襲向人來；朱晦翁，吕東萊，陳龍川諸道學先生的必擇此地來講學，以及一般宋儒的每喜利用山洞或風景幽麗的地方作講堂，推其本意，大約總也在想借了自然的威力來壓制人慾的緣故：不看金華的山水，這種宋儒的苦心是猜不出來的。</p>
<p>，初到方岩的一天，就在微雨裏游盡了這五峯書院的周圍，與胡公廟的全部。廟在巖頂，規模頗大，前前後後，也有兩條街，許多房頭，在蒙胡公的福蔭；一人成佛，鷄犬都仙，原是中國的常例。胡公神像，是一位赤面長鬚的柔和的老人，前殿後殿，各有一尊，相貌裝飾，兩都一樣，大約一尊是預備着於出會時用的。我們去瞻仰胡公的那日，大約剛逢着了廢歷十月的初一，廟中前殿戲台上在演社戲敬神。台前簇擁着許多老幼男女，各流着些被感動的隨喜之淚，而戲中的情節說辭，我們竟一點兒也不懂，問問立在我們身旁的一位像本地出身，能說普通話的中年紳士，方知戲班是本地班，所演的爲殺狗勸妻一類的孝義雜劇。</p>
<p>從胡公廟下山，回到了宿處的程××店中，則客堂上早己經點起了兩大枝紅燭，擺上了許多大肉大鷄的酒菜，等候我們吃飯了；菜蔬豐盛到了極點，但無魚少海味，所以味也不甚佳。</p>
<p>第二天破曉起來，仍坐原轎繞靈岩的福善寺回永康，路上的風景，也很清異</p>
<p>第一，靈岩也係同方巖一樣的一枝突起的奇峯，峰的半空，有一穿心大洞，長約二三十丈，廣可五六丈左右，所謂福善寺者，就係建築在這大山洞裏的。我們由東首上山，進洞的後面，通過一條從洞裏隔出來的長衖，出南面洞口而至寺内，居然也有天王殿，韋駄殿，大雄寳殿，觀音堂等設置，山洞的大，也可想見了。南面四山環抱，紅葉青枝，照耀得可愛之至：：因爲天晴了，所以空氣澄鮮，一道下山去的曲折石級，自上面瞭望下去，更覺得幽深不能見底。</p>
<p>下靈岩後，向西北的繞道回去，一路上儘是低昻的山巔與旋繞的清溪。經過園内有兩株數百年古柏的周氏祠廟，將至俗名耳朶嶺的五木嶺口的中間，一段溪光山影，景色眞像是在畫裏，西南處州各地的逺山，呼之欲來，回頭四望，清入肺腑。過五木嶺，就是一大平原，北山隱隱，已經看得出横空的一線，十五里到永康，坐汽車回金華，還是午後三上點鐘的時候。同游的，是陳萬里，郎靜山，黄伯惠，及杭江路局的曾蔭千諸位先生。</p>
<h3>新賣解者</h3>
<p>— 繩夫</p>
<p>小時候我愛看賣解者。但賣解者也有新舊，現在的賣解者自然也要摩登化了舊的行頭大，最少陪着一個藥箱，一繫刀橋，還有一副　　，有時　　　一面或幾面方尖的旗。玩的地方，大概是市集的鄉鎭上，比較寛闊的場子，在密集的都會，就多半揀取一塊較大的廢墟，還没有建造洋樓的曠地。玩法是先用鑼鼓招摇一會，勾引些無事忙的羣衆，竪起旗子，紥好地盤，要幾套拳棍，用磚頭，鐵棒，或没口的刀，敲擊自己的頭皮，搥拍自己的胸脯，割自己的手臂，讓牠隆起，發紫，見血，然後從藥箱拿出自己祖傳秘製的藥膏來，讚一番，貼上自己做成的傷痕上，於是藥到病除，有手爲證。於是又捧着一盤子膏藥向觀衆兜賣，直至無人過問時，這才收場</p>
<p>新的呢，没有藥箱，也没有刀棍，雖然，也有一面鑼，但鼓大概是付缺如的，只是多一個人背着兩個用布紮成兩手互抱着的人形，這一方面是新的廣告，只一方面就是新賣解者自己並無武藝，身上經不起搥打，只能紥一個布偶背在背上。玩法是：背着布紥人形伏下去，兩手叉在地上，原來的兩隻脚做了背上人形的脚，兩隻手便做了另一人形的兩條腿，頭用一塊頂上披下來的破布遮着　　　　兩　人在　　　　　　　　　丰和鮮辟歷拍拉的打滾，嘴裏么喝，級伐。鑼　的　緊，也　打的愈緊，於是觀衆大喝其采，賣解者，爬起來，向觀衆拱拱手，觀衆抛完了銅板，一切完事大吉。</p>
<p>如果將新舊賣解者比較起來，前者費力多，要弄刀弄棍，一不翟心，肚子上的皮不免要眞的割去一塊，自己吃苦是小，最重要的是會影響到藥膏的靈不靈，觀衆也不免要喝倒采的。並且裝腔作勢，確也很不經濟。新賣解者郤取巧得多，並不須自己出力，只要有兩個人形摟着，做一個撕榖的姿勢就行，並且，還不用藥膏，免了許多口舌。</p>
<p>他們同樣的欺騙觀衆，但，弄的巧拙不同，前者漸漸被後者所代替了。</p>
<p>我們常常看見這些名角，藉了一對偶人而發達了，但他們却成爲賣解者的英雄，不再幹這勾當了。因此，他的布偶也就不知在何時抛向何方去了。</p>
<p>世代巳經進步，我已看不到我的幼年時代那般熱閙的賣解者了。雖並無所留戀，但終不免有點今不如古之感耳。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（四十九）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>可是當他回到了他的房裏時，他猶疑着不敢跑下去吃晚飯。他太痛苦了。他那被激怒了的心，還不曾有着充分的時間來平靜。可是他終於决定下去了，他在飯廳出現的時候，大家正在就席了。</p>
<p>每個人臉上都現得喜氣洋洋的。</p>
<p>「喂，你們置辦東西置辦得怎麽樣了？我呢，我非等到一切都舖排好了，是什麽都不願看」</p>
<p>的。」</p>
<p>他的女人回答：</p>
<p>「置辦得很有個樣子了。不過爲着怕買得不合適，非經過長久的考慮不可。現在最呌我們操心的是家具的問題。」</p>
<p>她這天和哲安看了一天的毛氈和家具。她想要買稍稍華麗的，闊氛的質料，以便引起人家注意。反之，她的兒子却要那種質樸且古雅的。於是，在店　拿給他們看的樣品前面，他們彼此重又伸述着各人的論證。她的意思，那些顧客，那些訴訟人，非給以感動不行，應當使他們走進待客室中便有一種富麗之感。</p>
<p>反之，哲安却祇想吸引那些高雅且豪富的顧客，想以自己那種質實而穩妥的趣尚征服那些才智之士。</p>
<p>於是那繼續了一整天的爭論，從吃湯的時候起，重又展開了。</p>
<p>羅蘭没有什麽意見。他重說道：</p>
<p>「我呢，我什麽都不願聽。等你們一切都弄妥時，我去參觀好了。」</p>
<p>羅蘭嬷嬷徵求她的大兒子的意見道：</p>
<p>「喂，筆爾，你覺得怎樣？」</p>
<p>他的神經被刺激得簡直想要以一種咀咒來回答他的母親。但他以一種含着怒意的乾脆的語調說道：</p>
<p>「啊－我嗎，我是完全贊成哲安的意思的。我所喜歡的祇是質樸，我以爲趣味方面的所謂」</p>
<p>質樸是可以和性情方面的所謂正直相比的。」</p>
<p>他的母親接着說：</p>
<p>「可是你得想想我們是住在一個商人的城市裏，優良的趣味在這裏是不適行的呢。」」</p>
<p>筆爾回答：</p>
<p>「那有什麽關係呢？難道因爲這樣我們便得去倣效那些傻東西嗎？假使我們的鄉鄰都是一」</p>
<p>些蠢人或是壞人，難道我們也得去學樣嗎？一個女人不會因爲她的鄰近的女人都有情人也跟着養漢的。」</p>
<p>哲安笑了起來：</p>
<p>「你簡直像在一位道學先生的格言裏找了一些比喻來作論證啦。」」</p>
<p>策爾什麽也没回答。他的母親和他的弟弟又開始談着料子和靠椅等等。</p>
<p>他像早上動身到特洛威爾去之前瞧着他母親一樣瞧着他倆·他像一個在觀察着什麽的陌生人一樣瞧着他倆，他眞的覺得像是突然走進了一個陌生的家庭一樣。</p>

<h3>糧食標粉麥初平繼漲</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初平盤漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小五六七角左右、坎拿大小二三角、故初開時、人心平平、迨後因廠家觀望不抛、業外人心、終因存底尚未豐厚、一致看高、近逺期均紛紛收進、因此交易雖未大暢、喊價則步趨高昻迨至下午開盤、傳大連帮收買、并洋麥加稅之說、又舊事重提、目下一般人之推測、以爲加稅實行、市面當非漲不可、所以近逺期之買氣、復步步旺盛、觀後步局面、或尚須趨高也、結果本月份較前週漲四分、一月份漲三分、二月份漲三分七釐半、三月份漲四分二厘半、四五月份漲三分半、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「摩登」的内容和形式</h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>近幾年來，不知是那一位會翻花樣的文人把英文的「現代」一語；譯其音爲「摩登」，批發到中國各界的市塲之上。不料很快的聲影吠和，竟蔚成一「時代的狂颷」！於是我們都有了眼福，去領教：摩登大衣，摩登鞋襪，摩登木器，摩登商店，摩登按摩院，摩登建築，摩登男女……等。這普遍化的現象是不勝指屈的，一言以蔽之：有物皆「摩」，無事不「登」！</p>
<p>物極必反。「摩登」先生旣成爲無事之不與，同時也在某一部分人士中間，做了衆駡之所歸。在許多「不求甚解」的半知識分子，尤其是「衛道」的老生宿儒的觀感中，大都抹煞「摩登」二字之平凡簡單的解釋，以爲凡屬所謂「摩登」也者，就是指着充分暴動曲線的艶裝，一九三四年的西服而言，至於「摩登男女」，衛道之士簡直以爲是「浪子淫娃」的「别署」！愈誤愈逺，以訛傳訛，結果一切希奇古怪，浪漫風流的現象，都統而名之曰「摩登」。「摩登」的遭際如此，固然是鋒頭十足，但同時也就倒霉萬分！</p>
<p>其實「摩登」云云，不過站在時代前面，力求生活方式的「現代化」而巳，不但意義平常，而且是二十世紀人類所迫切需要。尤其在事事開倒車的中國，對於政治思想，生產方法各方面，都非力求「摩登」，不能免於物競天擇的淘汰。難道我們現在還應該信奉「半部論語取天下，半部論語致太平」的「政治原理」麽？難道我們現在還應該遲滯在男耕女織的奮生產方式，而不把電氣和機械應用</p>
<p>所以對於囂然塵上，毁譽互見的「摩登」二字，應該把牠的形式和内容分開來看，排斥「形式主義」的摩登，而講究内容充實的摩登。過去一般人在生活方式上力求「摩登化」的流弊，並不在「摩登」二字的本身，而在一切摩登之徒尚形式。「形式主義」的「摩登」之必然結果，就是互相影響，專在消費和享樂方面做「摩登」工夫，於是，西裝，跳舞，肉感名片，口紅，荳丹，斯丹康，香水精，高跟鞋，曲線美都在有意無意之間，被善男子，信女人們視爲構成「摩登」的重要條件。「形式主義」的「摩登」的最大損失，絶不是如衛道君子所認識的那樣，弄成「人慾横流」的「禽聚獸處」，而是以下的幾點：</p>
<p>一，給與封建勢力和守舊派以乘機反攻的藉口：「因噎廢食」，是我們「國粹主義」者的一貫邏輯，因爲形式主義的摩登有了流弊，於是就主張「復古」。一切「恢復民族固有道德精神」，用古樂祀孔，翻印論語孝經，限制不許用西式文具，都是守舊派存心與一切「摩登」言行對立的直接反動。</p>
<p>二，給帝國主義者擴大奢侈品的市塲：徒尚形式的摩登，勢必導向拚命購用外國化裝品和一切奢侈用品之一途。所以在上月一月之間，日本的鏡子和高跟鞋各有三四百箱的輸入，於是「友邦」的報紙竟喜形於色地稱讚：「中國婦女之購買力遞增，街頭氣象，頓成活氣」！嗚呼！中國的「摩登」婦女們！對於日文報紙的譽揚，　知所感到的味兒是酸，甜，苦，辣的那一樣？</p>
<p>三，給若干　舖添進許多「原當摩衣」：摩登衣飾的式樣，照例是一年數變，聽憑裁縫們，專傢們去花樣翻新。所以，眞正摩登男女的衣飾，頂多穿五六次就要束之高閣。結果這些「奇形怪樣」，「窮嫌富不愛」的衣裳，在「久貶冷箱」之餘，就多半會轉入「長生庫」，而且在未進去之先，主人就對牠們判了「無期徒刑」的，到了滿當出貨之後，只有到石路北京路一帶去被店員們翻來覆去地抖着「呌口號」，大體還是一個「窮嫌富不愛」！</p>
<p>四，提高上中社會青年之驕奢享樂的頽廢情緒：摩登運動專門在形式上做工夫，結果就是只在衣，食，住，行，聲，色各方面去追求過度的不激和享受，個人的前途，民族國家，都一概列入「管他娘」的預算之中。例如在熱河失陷，平津危急的時候，北平若干摩登男女，還是照例的跳舞溜冰。老實說，「摩登」到這種程度，簡直是没落前夜，不知死活的「釜底游魂」！</p>
<p>對於上述「荒謬得可以」的形式主義的摩登之正確而必要的糾正，就是努力去充實一切生活方式，言論行動之「摩登化」的内容，換言之，就是在政治認旘，文化思想各方面，都站在時代的前鋒，少呌口號，少唱高調，脚踏實地的身體力行，同時對於一切「形式主義」的「摩登」，都應該與以無情的批判和反對！</p>
<h3>魔鬼</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>吃了夜飯，戴上呢帽，預備到報館裏去，霞突然攔住了，呌我且慢點走，有新鮮花樣景，看了看去，好待你寫稿子，添些新資料。問她什麽事情？她只是格格地笑着，「我也不知道什麽事情，不過知道是一件怪有趣的把戲，你且等着看吧」。終於這樣不澈底的回答我，使我莫名其耶穌堂。</p>
<p>華燈初上，我們同居的，後廂房，寡婦趙家嫂嫂的家裏，陡然擁滿了一大羣人，同時，趙家嫂嫂，臉帶悲慘而緊張的情緒，在急迫的關閉門窗。這時，霞拉了我的手說：「再不去，被她關在門外，要看不見了」。於是身不自主地，跟了霞走向後廂房去。進了門，一看，屋里男男女女，巳擁塞了三十多人，他們立着，坐着，都屏息靜氣，神情，嚴肅，幽默，好像在恭候法官的開庭。在各人的竊竊私議中，探知了趙家嫂嫂，今夜請了一位「仙人」，來舉行「磨鬼」禮，立大桌旁，穿長袍，戴呢帽，的男子，便是「仙人」，據說他的法術，是萬分靈騐啦。</p>
<p>「磨鬼」，這名稱，倒新頴奇特，也許是别開生面的鬼戲吧，所以，來觀光的人，有這末興哩。</p>
<p>屋的中央，擺了一張八仙桌，桌面上，只有一個香爐，幾串銀綻，桌子三面，圍了黑布，單單靠北的一面空着，桌底下，罩了一只小籐斗，裏面放着一碗白米，這幕鬼戲，祇有這一些簡單的佈置。</p>
<p>在靜寂的空氣中，男子忽然卸下長袍，除下呢帽，一身紥束好了，把眼睛向四週，擺六六打量了一回，神情很嚴肅地，向趙家嫂嫂道：「人太多了，恐怕陽氣重了，靈魂不敢來的，尤其陽氣重的男子，更覺犯關！好不好請男的出去吧？」趙嫂嫂今天請「仙人」來的目的唯一希望，和死了一年多的，親愛的丈夫，幽明交談一下，現在聽說男子是阻礙她丈夫幽魂的障碍物，心中那得不急，於是下逐客令，把不相識的男子，驅之門外。鬼戲開始了，男子丨仙人丨先把趙家嫂的丈夫的名字，年歳，死的日子，寫了一張字條，用火焚了，算到隂間傳人的傳票，那時他吩咐看的人，一律蹲倒地下，並不許走近桌邊，然後他手中執了一個木盤，用一只酒蛊，在盤上，手不停揮的磨擦着，在「譁啦譁啦」的聲音中，就命趙家嫂嫂，匍匐地下，鑽進黑布裏面，向籐斗問話，鬼的幽魂，就來接話的，不過問時態度要誠懇，心中要誠信，不然鬼要動氣走的。趙家嫂嫂，聽了他的指揮，鑽進桌下，問：「你是啥人？」「我是趙濤生」，「幾歳」？「三十二歳」，「幾時死的」？「去年八月裏」，「你死了呌我靠啥人？」「……」這時忽然籐斗里「嗚嗚咽咽」的哭起來了，趙家嫂嫂，聽了心中悲痛，也停了問話，而「嗚嗚」的，哭起來了。鬼戲停了之後，看的人，議論紛紛：「呌有智識的男子，走出去，恐怕識破了他的破綻啦」「這鬼的聲音，是他在幕後嘴里發出來的，所以借磨盤的聲音，混亂着。」「你們想，幾句凖的話，都是剛才趙家嫂嫂，向他告訴了，寫在傳票上的話，問着不曾告訴他的話，就借哭聲來唐突。」</p>
<p>「恐怕人家立着，識破了他幕後的舉動，所以呌一律蹲倒地下。」但趙家嫂嫂，還多麽地深信啊，眼睛哭得紅紅地，逢人便說「仙人」怎樣地靈騐，三十元的代價，還是便宜啦！唉！中國人的迷信，何等地深刻啦·</p>
<h3>無聊的星期日</h3>
<p>— 里月</p>
<p>星期一開始以後，就熱烈地期望着星期日的到臨，然而每次星期日帶給我的無聊，除把星期六晚上憑空而生的一切愉快的憧憬幻滅得乾乾淨淨而外，賸餘的只是可詛咒的疲乏，和不能自振的頽唐！是阿，在這個時代，「星期日」豈是我們有份兒的？</p>
<p>又是一個無聊的星期日在我下意識的期待中臨到了，我有些憤慨地想：難道我們眞個是應該讓牛馬的工作佔據，我們整個身心的嗎？「星期日」没我們的份兒，是誰規劃的呢？因此，我下了决心，我要抗爭！但是從那一處「抗」起呢？問題就擺在我眼面前了。</p>
<p>「媽的×，管他媽的三七二十一，袋裏還有幾個毫子，看影戲去，今天樂上一樂再說。」像自暴自棄的，又像和誰賭氣般的一口氣狂奔到「××大戲院」</p>

<h3>現代名人書畫</h3>
<p>— 朱其石先生作品</p>
<p>裏，買了票，把頭昻起坐在最後排的一個角落裏。</p>
<p>因爲一大堆的不平，緊　住我整個的心，獨自坐在人堆裏，混亂複雜的思潮，起伏地翻騰着，四週座上的一些甚麽人，我簡直没有知道，這時就是有誰要問我將開的影片呌什麽名字，我亦是同樣地茫然不能回答。</p>
<p>陡然間，四圍給黑暗佔據了，當前的白布幕上開始跳動着著了西裝的紳士老爺般的男子，和頭髮捲曲的打扮得妖精樣的女人的像影，煩躁的音樂，有力地振擊着我的耳鼓感着怪不自在的難受。　　一　標凖美人呀！喲，我歡喜這個臉，這個美麗標緻的臉呀！」一個肥臉大屁股，挺着高高的乳峯的女人的像影，幌動在布幕上的時候，這樣一個驚奇的羨慕的呼喊發自緊隣的座上，怪刺耳的，像是一個女人的聲音。接着，一個帶有刺鼻的香的毛葺葺的東西觸着我的耳朶上了，我把頭急劇地偏開來，心頭搏擊着像受了極度的驚駭。</p>
<p>「先生，標凖美人多美呀！等一忽，她還要表演淴浴呢！……」隣座的女人的聲音，輕微地從道毛葺葺的東西裏發出來了。因爲她這突如其來，我倒感着不能應付的不安和窘急，可是那毛葺葺的東西愈加接近我了，差不多碰上了我的臉，我心裏實在覺得這眞是怪討厭的，然而不下意識地還是以鼻音答應着－「唔，唔。……」，把頭更偏得逺些。</p>
<p>默然了大概十分鐘，布幕上現出了跳躍着的「休息」兩個美術字，電燈便重放光明，我揉着眼睛狂放地打了一個呵欠。</p>
<p>「先生疲倦了嗎？……哈哈！標凖美人還不夠味兒嗎？哈！」這個有些熟識的裝着嬌柔的刺激耳朶的聲音，提醒了我把視線移向着我的緊隣的座上，一個白得發青的瘦長臉蛋兒，被覆着發出刺人鼻子的香的毛葺葺捲曲的長髮的中年女人的形像速迅地飛進了我的眼簾：血紅的嘴唇在噴着烟圈兒，烏溜溜而亮晶得閃閃發光的眸子一瞬，不停地對四座瞟着，平平的胸脯在没規則地呼吸着。她看着我默然没有聲息地看了她一眼，她不自然地扁着嘴向我笑着，我不敢理睬她，只裝作不曾看見的把頭抬高了仰望着天花板上刻畫着的顏色和線條都不調和不均匀的花圖，心裏有些抖戰，便再放情地打了一個呵欠。</p>
<p>空間又恢復了前半個時間的黑暗，布幕上重新跳動着一大些像影兒，煩躁的音樂，依然是振擊着我的耳鼓，而感着難受的刺激，可是，這回她，緊隣隔座上的那個奇怪的女人，不再把毛葺葺的東西刷着我的臉了，也不再滔滔地對我，又像是自語的裝着嬌柔的刺耳的聲音說話了，差不多連那不規則呼吸的氣息聲都聽不見，然而我還是鎭靜地把頭直抬着不敢斜望她一下。因爲這安靜，我才看清楚了些布幕上映現出的事物：一個妖艶的女人赤裸着坐在浴缸裏洗澡，歪着頭裝腔地在和門外的一位西裝紳士老爺模樣的男子答話之類的事情，我也見着了。</p>
<p>忽然間，布幕上的那個肥臉大屁股，挺着高聳乳峯的女人因向那紳士老爺樣的人求婚不成，而自殺了！我有些不大理解地直睜開眼睛望着，以爲還有很多的下文。但是布幕上接着映現出的巳經不是人物了，只是一個斗大的「完」字，音樂隨着停歇了，電燈也放着光明，我懶懶地站立起來·狂放地打了一個呵欠。接着，我發現緊隣的座位巳空着了，那個奇怪的中年女人不知是在什麽時候就走了。四圍的人們也都站起來整理着他們的衣領；好些人嘴裏還喊着，「可惜，如此一個標緻美麗的女人竟自殺死了！」的嘆息聲。我便擠在人潮裏莫明其妙地流出到馬路的中心來，我深深地吸了一口氣，再任情地打了一個呵欠。</p>
<p>無聊的星期日，它帶給我的總是咒詛的沮喪的無聊！</p>
<h3>幸災樂禍</h3>
<p>— 禂光漢</p>
<p>「測隱之心，人皆有之，」這是事實。但「幸災樂禍」的心理，也幾乎没人無。弄堂口偶然有兩位好漢打架，便有一些好事者圍着拍手喝彩，給他們助威。馬路上有時一記黄包車給一輛汽車撞翻，乘客由車上滾下，頭破血流，車夫也受了傷，許多駐足而看的閒人，也會大笑起來。遇到火警就更熱鬧了，逺近居民都要走來觀光。甚至連殺頭場面，也常會引聚着無數看客。蓋這些小事大事，不管災禍經重，盡職目爲一種「喜劇」，故人人高興看。而且，受災蒙禍的又是别人，並非旁觀者自己或自己人，看起來自然也就格外有趣了！</p>
<p>就普通說，幸災樂禍是由一種好奇心所激起。但有些情形就不然了。某甲和某乙有仇，現在某乙突被人陷害，某甲心裏不免稱快。雖則加害者不是某甲本身，但受害者却是仇人某乙，好像有人替他報怨。有　人家被鄰居欺負，偶而鄰居可憐死了孩子，這個人家就覺得很開心，以爲天理果眞不爽。這種幸災樂禍的心理，都是含有惡意的。</p>
<p>幸災樂禍尚有别種作用，就是望他人罹災禍，自己可以獲得好處。這要舉</p>
<p>實例來說明。日本對我國所抱幸災樂禍的心理，便屬於這一種。我國頻年受盡天災人禍的厄運，這在我們算是莫大的不　可是由日本人看起來，却就要私自欣慶。因爲他們可以乘我們的危難來加緊厭迫我們，制我們的死命。</p>

<h3>妹妹底髮辮</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>十五年北伐的時候，我正害着不重不輕的毛病，城裏正也風雲緊急，鄉裏又是拿槍都打不到一個銅板，於是爸爸翻了興奮的臉，呌我不要去上學了，登在家裏，一方面養了病，一方面也可一幹賣膏藥式的小學。</p>
<p>小學的牌剛剛豎起三日，居然就有不少的孩子們來「掛號」，我意識到這是時代臨了，賣膏藥也許可轉成賣參葺，於是興奮的我，端正的坐近塌脚的檯桌，拿出墨，拿筆，拿出從城裏帶回去的五彩洋紙，拿出一幅從城裏習染得「凡事靠廣告號召」的花頭經的心理，再開始作廣告的探試。還記得第一句是「時代臨了」！第二句仍是「時代臨了」！到第三句才輕輕的轉了一下舵：「本校男女兼收。」這廣告逺逺近所的貼發出去，又居然有不少的老爺，太太，長年，媽子來探問口風：「男女兼收固然是新辦法，是該當的，可不知規矩緊不緊？」當時概由我負責答復：「城裏的男女同校，不免有些馬虎，至於我們這廟是很負責的，任憑城裏是怎樣的開放，開裸體會，開跳舞會，我們這廟不論大小男女都要分班上課的！貴家長儘可放心「！」於是也就有人就便掛了號才回去。</p>
<p>開學的那一日，女學生成行的來了八名，都是大家閨秀，芳齡都是十四五歳的樣子，男學生多到近四十名，大的小的都是帶走帶跳，嬉皮笑臉的，事實上不允許分班，就混在一堂，女學生都縮着腰身吃吃笑的擠在一個角落裏。</p>
<p>晚上十歳的小妹妹向我要求：「哥哥你說女學生要分班的，爲什麽今天没有分？明天分嗎？分的話，我也想讀，媽媽己經允許了我！」我說：「好的，不過有一個條件，首先要剪掉小辮子·」「呵呀，不行，那我寗願不讀？」妹妹口快嘴快的翻身就逃跑了。</p>
<p>第二天妹妹又來要求，我仍以剪辮的條件相對，我說：「其他的女學生都凖備剪了，只要你倡個首。假使你依從我的話，我不收你的學費，爸爸給你的學費，你都拿去買糖吃好了，而且還送書給你，送墨，送筆，送紙給你，只要你倡個首！」這才使得妹妹允許了，媽媽却死也不肯，他說「教書就教書，快莫弄這樣的新名堂，辮子剪了成什麽樣子，會像一隻駱駝鷄！」二嫂子也在旁邊附和：「葆姑，察親的來了，駱駝鷄。」但我不待她們細說，巳不把揪住妹妹的髮辮剪下了。</p>
<p>妹妹也還好，她不以此懊惱，媽媽，嫂子也就没有辦法了。從此妹妹更爲我遊說，結果八個女學生的髮辮，也剪下了五個，大家都說比從前方便了，清潔了，而且短髮下的臉袋，個個比先前漂亮了些，只是那未剪的三個，就此輟學不來了，我也没曾再去試用我的廣告。</p>
<p>學堂辦不到一年，城裏出了亂子，鄉下也跟着有些騷亂了；但是妹妹還是短髮，其他的女學生也一樣還是短髮，她們都矢口承應短髮的好處。</p>
<p>其後我的身體健了，就逺逺的離開了故鄉，幾年之中，我常常憶及妹妹的頭髮，還是保持着短髮？又蓄起了髮辮？</p>
<p>前番我回鄉，眞不料妹妹又蓄起髮辮了，而且與人比例的長大起來了，比從前大了一倍，長了三倍，而且矢口埋怨我，說好容才再蓄起來。母親是去世了，二嫂子站在旁邊說：「爲了没有髮辮，不知失了多少定親的好機會！」妹妹更說：「從前的那五個女學生的髮辮都蓄得比我的還要長大了！」我只是唔，唔，唔」的應着。</p>
<p>自然，闊别的故鄉，一切的一切－－積弊，黑暗，都像妹妹又蓄起了髮辮一樣，長大得多了。</p>
<p>時代臨了，時代又一忽溜了。</p>
<h3>當活人</h3>
<p>— 邨人</p>
<p>當東西如衣服被褥家具之類，這在窮人是家常便飯的事。城市的破落户夏天當寒衣贖單衫，秋天當單衫贖寒衣，尤其是誰都不能夠恥笑誰的正經事。窮人在没東西可以當的時候，常常要喟然而嘆曰假如連人都可以當得的話，不用愁房租憂飯賬而且有錢可以用；現在眞的有當活人的這一回事，這年頭定眞是無奇不有！可是，這句話却是東鄰「友邦人士」對咱們中國來做的買賣，其目的在收買苦力以殖「邊防」，這就值得我們中國同胞注意的一件大事了。</p>
<p>古昔東周列國羣雄爭覇的時候，也就有過當活人的事。可是那是以公子親戚到異邦去做担保和平的寳貝，謂之「質」雖然也是當的意思，但和當東西的意義不同。當東西是借錢（還要付利息）而以東西爲質，其意義重乎借錢這一方面；東周列國羣雄爭覇以公子親戚爲質，其意義重於和平。爲了和平而當活人，那我們是誰都可以贊成的：爲了借錢而當活人，那我們是總覺得不大合理。何况東鄰的「友邦人士」别有作用地在給窮人當活人。</p>
<p>當活人本來在現社會還是有的，那就是爲了需要錢用以兒女到憲家典當爲奴爲婢，期到贖回，但没有利息，而且期限很久，起碼一兩年。現在東鄰的「友邦人士」在咱們中國的唐山開設當舖給窮人－咱們的窮苦同胞－當活人，限定在二十歳以内的青上，又限定兩個月不贖就死當，死當的活人要送到東北－「咱們中國的領土」－去殖「邊防」，而且限定一歳當一塊錢，利息在幾分甚至一兩錢以上，－這分明是在咱們中國的國境内收買人口子！何以說呢？一歳當一塊錢，就說每一個青年都是二十歳吧也只當二十塊錢，這巳經是人命不值錢了，何况利息那應高，更何况限期兩個月就死當，還不是以廉價的金錢在收買人口？</p>
<p>收買人口這一回事，在滿清時代帝國主義者於南洋開拓荒山就曾經托咱們的同胞那一批漢奸在收買豬仔去做苦力，廣東的商埠如澳門廣州油頭以及福建的厦門福州和江浙的上海寗波，温州，…每年豬仔出口很多。做豬仔的同胞，有願意的有不願意的，情形各自不同。願意的同胞大多數是受了誘惑以爲一到南洋就發財，不願意的同胞却是鄉下人不懂事受了欺騙而上鐵船去的。現在東鄰的「友邦人士」這一勾當，别玩花樣地以當活人的辦法來收買人口，論其性質與收買豬仔無異，論其辦法却似乎「光明正大」地以錢買人并非欺騙而且不願意者并不勉强。這是多麽狡猾隂險的萬惡行爲！</p>
<p>咱們中國連年人禍天災，陜西的同胞一條人命連一個麵包的價都不如，東鄰的「友邦人士」以這一種巧妙的方法來收買人口，窮人們還不趨之若驁？何况還有漢奸從中慫恿，誘惑，欺騙？而這一些被收買的豬仔，一到東北－「咱們中國的領土」－其用處有兩種，一種是養下來做「滿州國」的人民，苦力式的人民替他們帝國做牛馬；一種是養下來做「滿洲國」的基本隊伍的兵士當砲灰，以殖「邊防」，而「勦」我義勇軍及打蘇聯。</p>
<p>活人可以和東西用品一樣的拿去當己經是奇事，死當以後送到東北去殖「邊防」尤其駭人！可是報紙登載這一新聞－確實是新聞－的時候，只記這一消息并没有其他消息如當地政府反對，抗議，取締…等事，尤其是令人詫異的事。大概這是在恊議之下的非明文所規定的吧？那就眞正是「親善」的所賜了，不但不用詫異而且應該慶祝昇平。</p>
<h3>心理的適應</h3>
<p>— 木郎</p>
<p>儘管社會經濟是怎樣地在死滅下去，人們對於某種「輸將」的熱誠是不會漸漸淡退的；雖然一般的愛國事業他們不大肯做，而這種「輸將」却也是愛國的舉動中的一種。</p>
<p>小市民們被社會的殘酷的鬭爭磨折得氣息奄奄了。現實的巨擔把他們壓成「人乾」，他們恐怖，他們消極和頽唐，他們渴想逃出這現實的圈了，於是他們的惟一的憧憬就是不費勞力地發一注財可這；以幫助他們退縮到一隻比較安靜的角落裏，冷眼看别人厮殺：除了自己的不被浪濤吞没，一切都可以管他娘」！順應小市民這種心裏的便是發財票以及和字差不多之類的興起，因爲這是惟一療治他們的心疾的藥餌。又何妨如在這個上面加一重救國的名義，於是即使小市民們買了之後而不中，他們也大可以己盡救國一分之職自慰，把那自己的一層獨善其身，逃避現實的劣根性輕輕地抹去了。此所以别的救國事業可以不做，而此等救國舉動大可以行得也。</p>
<p>小市民們的欲望是淺短的。他們的「良心」非常「平」他們差不多都說，「我即便頭奬不中，有一個二奬或三奬也就夠了。再不然，拿個把小彩總也是好的，有這些錢到鄉下去，一輩子的化的嗎？」照經濟中「供」和「求」的兩個最緊要的原則說，有小市民們這些「退一步」的要求，就得有饜足他們的要求的多量的供給。所以，把發財票分條出售了，一來使他們的購買力格外便利；二來把原來的希望擴大幾倍，雖然每一希望的原質同時也就比前縮减了幾倍，但它對於小市民們仍舊是感得很滿足的。</p>
<p>現在小市民們的心理是愈加被人家揣摩得透頂了。年關是我們所最重視的，發了財過年，安安心心地喝年糕湯，天下還有比這再舒服的事嗎？</p>

<h3>The Fujian Army Lacks Sufficient Preparations for Invading Zhejiang; Contact Talks Are Premature; Cai Tingkai Arrives in Zhangzhou by Plane; Foreign Powers Advise Nationals to Withdraw from Fujian</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The rumor of contact between Zhejiang and Fujian began yesterday in Shanghai. However, a certain central authority completely denied this, with a very firm attitude. It is said that this rumor stems from a lack of military common sense and knowledge of the area's geography. The Fujian side certainly intends to invade Zhejiang, but it lacks more than three divisions of troops to make any significant headway. Their military transport requires at least one month of preparation. Assuming they were to deploy three divisions, even using the fastest method, it would take about ten days to concentrate them. Adding the time to form marching formations, compose supply trains, and the actual travel time, it would take more than a few days. Therefore, true contact is premature, considering the time since the Fujian Incident started. Our military deployment has long been ready, but whether to take offensive action is a matter of central discretion, which cannot be arbitrarily speculated upon at this time. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Zhangzhou reports that Cai Tingkai and Xu Minghong flew to Zhangzhou from the province on the afternoon of the 4th. Also, Liu Zhanxiong, commander of one army and one division, flew from Zhangzhou to Yanping on the 4th. The headquarters of the Fourth Army moved to Zhangzhou and arrived on the 4th.

However, most foreign nationals in Fujian are located in Fuzhou and Xiamen, with the largest number being Japanese, numbering around two thousand. There are over twenty thousand Taiwanese. Nationals from countries like Britain, America, France, and Italy are few, but not only four or five people. It is expected that for the safety of their lives and property, these nationals will leave Fujian within the near future.

<p>(Nanjing) British and American sides regard the Fujian Incident as the most important problem to suddenly occur in southeastern China. Foreign investment in Fujian is extremely large. Also, Japan has already obtained the convenience of a ceasefire agreement in the North China area. Therefore, the British and American side had to pay close attention to the situation in South China.

<p>(Nanjing) Gan Yun, the former member of the Fujian Provincial Party Steering Committee, was wanted by the Fujian side for opposing the Fujian Incident. He fled from Fuzhou with his family to Xiadoudu. On the 3rd, he was protected by the English consulate at Cangqian Mountain and escaped from Fujian on the Taikoo Nanchang. He arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 4th and is scheduled to report on the recent situation in Fujian and ask for guidance from the Central Party Headquarters on the 5th. He is also scheduled to go to Jiangxi in the next few days to meet Chiang and report everything. Gan said that the leaders and troops of the puppet organization are the 19th Route Army. However, since the war of resistance against Japan and bandit suppression, the only real strength that army still has is three regiments and one battalion of Yun Yinglin's brigade under Qu Shounian, stationed in the Fuzhou, Mawei, and Fuqing area. The other armies: Tan Qixiu's troops stationed in Quanzhou, Mao Weishou's troops stationed in Zhangzhou, and Shen Guanghan's troops in northern Fujian are all newly formed disorganized mobs with scattered morale. Due to Lu Xingbang, Zhou Zhiqun, and Liu Heding's three armies restricting them in northern Fujian, the army will definitely not be able to hold out and stubbornly resist when war breaks out. At the same time, in order to expand its strength, the Fujian side has specially appointed Weng Zhaoyuan as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Xing, Quanzhou, and Yongding, planning to incorporate Chen Guohui's old army into his own. However, since Chen Guohui was illegally executed by the Fujian provincial government, his subordinates Gao Weiguo and Yang Cui and others are all heartbroken and awaiting an opportunity to launch a revolt. The fleet sent by the Navy Department has been patrolling Sandu'ao under the leadership of Gao Shouting to block its sea supply. Lin Bingzhou's brigade of the Marine Corps also intends to oppose the Fujian government. The other troops are the first and second security teams, led by Xiao Shuxuan and Chen Jiyuan, who are not cooperating with each other. Therefore, they have already been attacked from all sides. The organizational content of the People's Government is very complicated, melting the Third Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Communist Party into one furnace. As for He Gonggan, the provincial governor, he is also passive. The most laughable thing is the People's Congress held in Fuzhou on the 20th of last month, which actually bought laborers and rickshaw pullers to be used by them, forcing the people to hang fake flags. And there have been many Party comrades who have been arrested and shot for opposing the puppet organization. Feng Yuxiang and Fang Zhenwu did not participate in it, but somehow, their names were dragged in. Peng Dehuai's arrival in Fujian was not heard of by him. When the 19th Route Army first entered Fujian, the people of that province mistakenly thought that the army was a truly struggling national army, so they expressed their support. Unexpectedly, after they entered Fujian, they implemented a variety of exorbitant taxes, so there is a folk song that says, "Forty-nine exchanged for nineteen people, the people have nowhere to go." Although it seems that they have a move towards Zhejiang, in fact, they still intend to develop from Fuqing through Xiaotian Xianyou Quanzhou Zhangzhou Shaoan and enter Shantou to establish a foundation. Hu Zhantang did go to Shantou, but after hearing about the complexity of the organization of the puppet government, he returned to Hong Kong and did not want to participate to avoid damaging his reputation.

Shi Zizhou presided over the meeting and believed that suppressing rebellion and bandits was an important plan for the government to seek national unification. Tong Yaohua then gave a speech, making an analysis and explanation of the self-contradictory and uncooperative points of the various party factions participating in the Fujian Incident, and condemned the so-called People's Government as a pro-Japanese and communist organization that seeks to harm the country and disturb the people. He analyzed and judged from the military and political aspects and believed that the Fujian Incident was not enough to overthrow the government, but could only create opportunities for the communist bandits. He hoped that all circles in the country would jointly condemn it. Representatives from all walks of life then gave speeches, with many words of warning. The conference then passed four resolutions: (1) To telegraph the Central Government to quickly send troops to suppress the Fujian rebellion to maintain discipline; (2) To telegraph Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to continue to suppress the communists and quickly send troops to quell the rebellion; (3) To telegraph the Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, and Hunan Provincial Book Bureaus to assist the Central Government in sending troops to suppress the Fujian rebellion; (4) Chen Mingshu and others took advantage of the crisis to incite chaos, destroy the Party, and harm the country, and the Central Committee members residing in China and abroad should be telegraphed to immediately return to the capital to protect the central government and jointly save the country from danger. At 12:00, the meeting adjourned with shouts of slogans. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3>Wang and Li Indicate They Will Not Participate in the Civil War; Sheng's Troops Surrounded in Dihua</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Yingqi, Chief of Staff to Ma Zhongying, stated that Xinjiang's postal and telecommunications services are monopolized by the provincial government, so there is no reliable news. He received a flight message from Commander Ma via Lanzhou last month, briefly reporting on military affairs. Sheng's troops are currently in Dihua and are surrounded by Ma's Third Regiment. Two-thirds of the food supply for the provincial capital of Dihua comes from southern Xinjiang, and one-third comes from Yili. After the military conflict, transportation to the south was cut off, and Sheng's troops faced significant financial difficulties, leading to an overabundance of military notes circulating in the market, with each hundred taels only worth one silver dollar, causing extreme financial chaos. The Volunteer Army, led by Wang Delin and Li Du, who retreated into Xinjiang from Russia, are scattered in the Yili and Dihua areas. Because Wang and Li's armies have indicated that they will not participate in the civil war, they have remained neutral to this day. The result of this conflict has become clear after Minister Luo's visit for personal inspection. The conflict between Sheng and Ma is absolutely not a conflict between Hui and Han peoples. The central government is too far away to intervene effectively, and there is talk of sending Wang Delin and Li Du to mediate, but this matter is likely to be difficult to achieve for the time being. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is widely rumored that Ma Zhongying has entered Dihua, but Liu Wenlong and Sheng Shicai telegraphed Nanjing to report victory, stating that after relieving the siege of Tacheng and Emin, Ma Heiying led his remnants in retreat. Subsequently, Li Fuxing invaded Jinglai but was again defeated by our western armies, and Li Fuxing was captured, with many bandits killed. The remaining bandits fled far away. Ma Zhongying personally led over 1,100 remnant bandits in an eastern offensive against Fuyuan and Gucheng, and our eastern armies launched an attack, seizing many military supplies. The Ma bandits led their remnants in flight and are currently being pursued and suppressed. Since the Ma bandits fled west, they have been repeatedly and severely attacked by our armies. In the battles of Zihongquan, Nanshan, Daban City, and Emin Tacheng, as well as the recent battles of Fuyuan and Gucheng, the bandits have been defeated in every engagement, merely causing disturbances everywhere. Shicai is comprehensively planning the overall situation and opportunistically suppressing them, hoping to pacify the border areas as soon as possible. Respectfully telegraphed. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Italian-Soviet Rapprochement and the Far Eastern Situation</h3>
<p>After the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov traveled east, making a special visit to Rome to meet with Italian leader Mussolini. The true content of their talks has not yet been fully disclosed. However, according to general observations, the 72-minute conversation between Mussolini and Litvinov likely revolved around the following two points:</p>
<p>First, the re-establishment of US-Soviet relations poses no political conflict with Italy and no economic impediment. Second, the tense situation in Europe is universally recognized. Relations between the Soviet Union and Germany are particularly strained. To achieve peace in Europe, it is essential to improve the current chaotic situation. Therefore, it is necessary to first seek understanding between the Soviet Union and Italy, and then proceed to break the current deadlock on disarmament. The previously agreed Four-Power Pact may be joined by the Soviet Union, transforming it into a Five-Power Pact.</p>
<p>The first of these two assumptions is self-evident and beyond doubt or scrutiny. In fact, there are no irreconcilable grievances between the Soviet Union and Italy. All economic interests and political power struggles are so distant that they are unlikely to lead to a sharp conflict. As for the second point, both the Soviet Union and Italy share a desire to resolve the European problem, but their positions and methods differ. The current state of Europe is characterized by a major division between the Versailles system and the non-Versailles system, as well as the confrontation between socialist and capitalist countries. The disharmony of interests, ethnic divisions, and complex political relations are unprecedented in history. The Soviet Union, located in Eastern Europe, must still consider the blockade by other nations, even though it spans Europe and Asia. Therefore, the use of peaceful diplomacy is essential. Italy, with its limited land and dense population, faces France as a strong enemy in North Africa and is constrained by Germany and France in Central Europe. To seek free development, it faces many unexpected obstacles. Therefore, it must seek friends in the international arena who can support Italy.</p>
<p>Logically, the socialist movement advocated by the Soviet Union and the fascism of Italy stand in stark opposition, leaving no room for reconciliation or understanding. It would seem that the Soviet Union and Italy should have severed ties long ago. However, the facts show the opposite of the general theory. Since ancient times, there has been no fixed right or wrong between nations and groups, and the connections of interests are constantly changing. Since the Soviet Union and Italy have no irreconcilable factors in terms of actual economic interests, the theoretical gap between labor dictatorship and capitalist dictatorship can be bridged as long as practical benefits are not too far apart, resulting in nothing more than a war of words.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is common for individuals to find themselves in situations where theoretical incompatibility does not preclude practical cooperation, and this possibility is even greater in the interests of national groups. Moreover, the Soviet Union and Italy each have special needs in Central Europe. The Soviet Union, surrounded by capitalist countries, must strive for peace. Italy, wanting to develop in North Africa and dominate the Mediterranean, must also establish appropriate international relations in Central Europe. Therefore, it is willing to fully engage with the Soviet Union to reduce concerns in the east and increase strength to the south. This is why the Soviet Union and Italy can temporarily put aside their ideal societies and seek practical understanding.</p>
<p>The need for this practical cooperation is especially strong for the Soviet Union. What the Soviet Union fears most today is Japan in the Far East. Japan has unleashed its imperialist military power to seize everything. The Chinese Eastern Railway is now almost entirely under its control, and Siberia will not be able to maintain its security through peaceful means. This is what the Soviet Union worries about day and night. Even if the disputes in Western Europe are complex, mutual checks and balances mean that no one dares to start a war lightly. Now that the Soviet Union and Italy can reach a compromise, the Soviet Union's western front will not be easily provoked. Even in the turbulent situation, western Soviet Union can achieve peace. However, the Soviet Union must strengthen its military preparations against Japan in the Far East. The rapprochement between the Soviet Union and France is already clear. The closeness between the Soviet Union and Italy, as recently expressed by Litvinov and Mussolini, is even more obvious. The target of their gaze is self-evident.</p>
<h3>Central and National Government Memorial Week Reports: Yu Youren on the Three Principles of the People; Dai Chuanxian on the National Higher Examinations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 107th Memorial Week on the morning of the 4th. Yu Youren, Zhang Ji, Miao Peicheng, Wang Qi, Li Zonghuang, Ji Liang, Li Ciwen, Li Jingzhai, Xie Zuomin, Xiao Jishan, Huang Fusheng, and all staff members were present. Yu Youren presided over the meeting and reported, stating briefly: "I went to the Northwest to inspect the disaster situation, but outsiders did not understand and called it passive. This is just a meaningless rumor. The Fujian Incident is a matter of rebellious parties betraying the country. As long as our party comrades have strong faith and recognize the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, building the country and governing the country with the party, and consistently working towards this goal, we can save China, save our party, and destroy all other reactionary forces. The reactionary facts of the Social Democratic Party occurred many years ago, but our comrades have not paid attention to them, resulting in today's incident. Now the Central Government is convening the Fourth Plenary Session, and everyone should not let it pass lightly again, thoroughly improving all politics and seeking ways to resolve the national crisis. At the same time, we should firmly believe that building the country and governing the country with the party is the only principle to save the country, and we should understand that the Three Principles of the People can truly save China from danger. I hope everyone will cheer up and strive to do their best." (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held Memorial Week at 10:00 AM on the 4th. Zhang Ji, Niu Yongjian, Chen Shuren, Li Yuanding, Lin Xiang, Wei Huai, Zhu Peide, Chen Shaokuan, He Yaozu, Lü Chao, and over 400 National Government staff members were present. Chairman Lin led the ceremony, and Dai Chuanxian reported on the Second National Higher Examinations, stating briefly: "This year's National Higher Examinations were held in both Nanjing and Peiping, but the test papers were all graded by the Examination Committee in Nanjing. The number of examinees in Nanjing accounted for about two-thirds, and Peiping accounted for one-third. The results in Nanjing were better than those in Peiping, which is closely related to the academic atmosphere and environment. Furthermore, the performance of examinees who took the exam with qualified credentials was better than that of university graduates. It usually costs the country 100,000 yuan for a graduate of a national university, but their performance is still slightly inferior to those who have not graduated from university. This is the most noteworthy issue for the future of education. In the First National Higher Examinations, only over 30 people were able to pass and be admitted. Afterwards, 10 points were added to each person's score to reach the target of 100 people. In this year's National Higher Examinations, 10 points were added to each person's score in the screening test, and all students admitted after the formal examination had scores above 60 points, which is more advanced than the First National Higher Examinations. However, among the 101 people admitted this year, the majority had average scores between 60 and 65 points, and very few were excellent. In the future, it is hoped that the examination system can be gradually popularized and improved. This responsibility should be borne by all educators in the country, and it is hoped that the heads of all agencies will provide assistance." (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Britain Unites with Allied Nations to Boycott Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was informed by the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Matsudaira, that the British House of Commons had unanimously resolved on the 29th of last month regarding the Anglo-Japanese trade competition that resolute measures would be taken when necessary, and the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce would be abolished. The President of the Board of Trade, Runciman, also expressed his approval, strongly advocating the establishment of a united front between Britain and European countries to curb the import of Japanese goods, thus demonstrating Britain's recent attitude towards Japan. Conservative Party Member of Parliament Fuller delivered a speech in the House of Commons on the same day (29th) as follows: "Japanese goods are engaging in aggression against British trade, and the British House of Commons is deeply concerned. Therefore, if the government is not satisfied with competing with Japan, the government should strive to seek all effective means to reduce the import of Japanese goods and maintain the British market. If necessary, the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Agreement can be resolutely abolished." It is noted that the majority of the Conservative, Liberal, and Labour Parties in the House of Commons approved the above proposal on the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Agreement and unanimously passed it. President of the Board of Trade Runciman also rose to explain as follows: "The Anglo-Japanese Treaty involves about 28 or even 30 countries, so the gains and losses of abolition must be carefully considered. Furthermore, before abolition, all means must be sought. In short, Britain may need a united front with European countries regarding the import of Japanese goods. The British government should not be too aggressive towards Japan at present, so as not to provoke the resentment of the world. It is still necessary to strive for friendly coexistence, so as to create this impression." (4th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Italy and Russia Cooperate to Maintain International Peace; Improve Tense Relations Between Germany and Russia; Relations Between Japan and Russia Also Discussed</p>
<p>Russia Restores European Status</p>
<p>Rome Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini issued a communiqué today after their meeting, stating that all issues endangering world peace were discussed. According to reliable sources, Russia and Italy are in complete agreement on international issues. As a result, the two countries will cooperate in diplomatic matters, as both aim for peace. It is now reported that Italy has decided to devote itself to improving the tense relationship between Germany and Russia. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini may advise German Chancellor Hitler. Russian authorities are very willing to express goodwill to Germany. Germany has great interests in Soviet Russia, so Germany may immediately accept Russia's goodwill. The result may be to promote the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between Germany and Russia, similar to those signed by Russia with its neighboring countries. In this way, Soviet Russia can restore its previous position in Europe. At the same time, Italy and Russia can mediate between Germany and France to reconcile them. The second step is to expand the Four-Power Pact, which guarantees European peace, into a Five-Power Pact, allowing Soviet Russia to join. However, this is still uncertain. It is believed that Litvinov and Mussolini also discussed the tense relations between Japan and Russia. The outcome of the discussions is not yet clear. The non-aggression treaty between Russia and Italy includes a clause stating that when contracting parties conclude commercial treaties with other countries, they must not harm the commercial interests of the contracting countries. For this reason, the recent agreement between Russia and the United States has not harmed Italian commercial interests. It is reported that Litvinov is in constant telephone contact with Stalin. Litvinov is quite satisfied with the results of his meeting with Mussolini. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov, in the spirit of cultivating friendship between the two countries, continued their meeting at the Palazzo Venezia today. Although no communiqué was issued on the content of the talks, it is reported that many international issues, such as disarmament, economic treaties, and the reorganization of the League of Nations, were all included in the scope of discussion, and particular attention was paid to issues directly affecting the two countries. In addition, they jointly studied the possibility of improving the world political situation in accordance with the spirit of the Italian-Russian Friendship Treaty. The two have agreed to exchange instruments of ratification of the Italian-Russian Friendship Treaty at an early date. (4th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome The Italian Emperor received Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov this morning for a 15-minute conversation. It is believed that Litvinov must have mentioned Japan during his meeting with Mussolini yesterday, stating that the Soviet Union is deeply concerned about Japanese imperialism in the Far East. Mussolini, in addition to mentioning the expansion of Japanese economic power, has never expressed his attitude towards Japan. In the two weeks before Litvinov's arrival in Italy, Italian articles often pointed out the harm of Japanese commercial aggression in Europe and advised Europe to deal with it in unison. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The French Express Deep Suspicion</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French express deep suspicion about Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov's trip to Italy to meet with Mussolini, believing that there must be some purpose in their talks. Some believe that the repeated reorganizations of the French government have prevented France from taking effective action in diplomatic matters, causing Litvinov to believe that Rome is easier to negotiate with than Paris, which is regrettable. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Saint-Brice, a famous reporter for the Daily News, commented: "Russia is deeply afraid of Germany's rearmament, and Italy does not advocate Germany's rearmament. Moreover, both Russia and Italy have strong popular organizations. If other countries reduce their standing armies, the strength of these popular organizations will be even greater. This is another situation shared by both countries. The reason why Russia and Italy attach special importance to the continuation of disarmament work is precisely for this reason. However, Italy regards supporting Germany as an element in maintaining the balance of power in Central Europe, and Italy's Balkan policy is close to Bulgaria. On the contrary, Soviet Russia is very suspicious of Hitler's Germany and is trying to win over the Little Entente countries and Turkey in the Balkan Peninsula, while the Little Entente and Turkey are planning to isolate Bulgaria. Therefore, the views of Italy and Russia are not entirely the same. Mussolini must work hard to understand Moscow's intentions and cooperate with it." (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) A reporter for the Morning Post stationed in Rome telegraphed that the main reason for the talks between Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini seems to be limited to reconciling the relations between Germany and Soviet Russia. From the perspective of the Italian government, this is a major point in the disarmament issue. Germany and Japan are both inclined to use force, and Soviet Russia is located between the two, so its policy is close to the old balance of power doctrine, and it does not attach importance to the international cooperation doctrine that Italy has always advocated. However, if Soviet Russia's security in Germany can be guaranteed, then its views on disarmament, at least on European disarmament, will inevitably change. Mussolini intends to persuade Soviet Russia to understand this meaning. This task is naturally difficult, because Germany and Russia not only have fundamentally different political systems, but their interests and emotions are also opposite. However, from Italy's point of view, this mediation task is worth a try. If Italy can mediate the opinions of Germany and Russia, then the disarmament problem can be gradually resolved according to Italy's proposals. If the rapprochement between France and Germany can be realized, then Italy's mediation task between Germany and Russia will be easier to start. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Europe is Moving Towards Peace, Seemingly Not Forgetting the Pain of the Great War; The German-Austrian Unification Movement is Postponed</h3>
<p>(New York) Herbert Croly, Deputy Director of the European Office of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a wealthy American, has returned to the United States after several years in Europe. He recently wrote an important long article in the New York Times, stating briefly that based on his personal observations in Europe, he deeply feels that the period of the outbreak of the Great War is still far away. Many who return to the United States from Europe believe that war is imminent, which is actually not true. Although there are various forces in Europe that profit from war and are inciting war, the peaceful forces of the people of all countries are sufficient to overcome these war forces with a surplus. In fact, the terror and poverty caused by the last war made everyone wary and have not forgotten it to this day. Therefore, the momentum against war is still very widespread and large. The Balkan countries are currently organizing to avoid conflicts. Turkey has clearly expressed its intention for peace, so it has signed various economic and political agreements with neighboring countries to seek cooperation through various avenues. As for the German-Austrian unification movement, it has now been postponed and can only be carried out after the crisis between Germany and Austria is eliminated and an economic friendship treaty is signed. France is the center of European politics, but its government is absolutely unstable, and the cabinet has been changed repeatedly. This is because the French government's foreign policy can always represent the public opinion of French collectivist pacifism, while its fiscal policy cannot represent public opinion. Although the legacy of former Foreign Minister Briand has a lasting and unchanging influence on French public opinion, France has always maintained peace as its only policy externally. Now, if Britain, France, and Italy are to cooperate closely in times of emergency, then the agreement between France and Germany will be successful. The conclusion is: "At any time since the Great War, we have never been closer to the goal of peace than we are today. This is what we can hope for and what we can believe in."

<h3>League of Nations Experts Draft Immigration Convention</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations held a meeting of experts here today to plan the relief of extremely poor immigrants. Experts from 12 countries, including Britain, Germany, Poland, Argentina, Denmark, France, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, attended and will prepare a draft convention to be submitted to the League of Nations Council. This is the first time that the League of Nations has drafted an immigration convention. Canada was also invited to attend this time, but refused to participate because the Canadian government decided to follow its own steps regarding the general issue of immigration.

<h3>Japan Expands Navy, Demands Change in the 5:5:3 Ratio; Air Force Increased to Thirty-Nine Squadrons</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Ministry of the Navy told a Reuters representative today that although the naval budget of 670,000,000 yen has been reduced to 449,000,000 yen, this amount is still sufficient to implement the second supplementary program according to the original plan. However, additional funding may still be needed in the future. He also said that the ships to be built according to the program include two 8,500-ton cruisers, two 10,000-ton aircraft carriers, one mine-laying ship, 14 various destroyers, four various submarines, one oil tanker, one repair ship, one submarine tender, four torpedo boats, and four submarine chasers. As for aircraft carriers, it is reported that Japan is only allowed to build 12,000 tons according to the treaty. One of the two ships to be built will replace the existing 7,470-ton ship, which will then be dismantled. In addition to these newly built ships, it is also planned to allocate 75,000,000 yen to改造two battleships, two aircraft carriers, and two cruisers. The remodeled battleships will also have their gun positions raised. In addition, the Navy's air squadrons will also be increased by eight squadrons. According to the first supplementary program, the Navy's air squadrons will be increased from 17 to 29 squadrons from 1931 to 1937, and another 20,000,000 yen will be allocated for the addition of two squadrons from 1935 to 1938. Therefore, by April 1938, Japan will have a total of 31 naval air squadrons. Now, the second supplementary program plans to add eight squadrons from 1934 to 1938. If this plan is implemented, Japan will have no less than 39 naval air squadrons by the spring of 1938. In addition, there are aircraft carried by aircraft carriers and other warships. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Comparison of the American and Japanese Navies</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The second supplementary plan of the Navy started shipbuilding with a total budget of 430 million, because the expenses have been recorded in the budget. The ships and vessels within the scope of restriction, a total of 23 vessels and 63,800 tons; the ships and vessels outside the restriction, a total of 26 vessels, with unspecified total tonnage; totaling 48 vessels. The construction is scheduled to be completed within four years. After completion, the ratio of restricted ships and vessels in the Japanese and American navies, according to the survey results of the Ministry of the Navy, were released as follows:</p>
<p>United States Japan</p>
<p>Ship type Number Tons Number Tons</p>
<p>Battleships 15 455,400 9 272,070</p>
<p>Aircraft Carriers 6 131,300 5 78,420</p>
<p>Class A Cruisers 16 152,650 12 107,800</p>
<p>Under construction two vessels</p>
<p>Class B Cruisers 14 110,500 17 98,795</p>

<p>Other Auxiliary Vessels 200 595,870 145 442,699</p>
<h3>Naval Ministry of Japan Advocates Changing Current Ratios</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the naval report of U.S. Secretary of the Navy Swanson, which advocates an aggressive policy and strengthening of military power, the Japanese Naval Ministry authorities have expressed the following unofficial opinion: "The United States is exercising its legitimate rights under the London Treaty by implementing a shipbuilding plan within the scope stipulated in the treaty, and it is not for other countries to arbitrarily criticize this. However, its report advocates maintaining the current ratio of 5:5:3 between the United States, Britain, and Japan, to which the Japanese Navy can hardly agree. Naval Minister Osumi clearly stated in a statement published in various American newspapers on September 13 that the reduction of armaments should be separated into the issues of limiting combat power and ensuring safety. Moreover, naval disarmament depends on not being permanently bound by treaties. Japan signed the London Treaty for the benefit of mankind and with conditions. Twelve years have passed since the Washington Treaty was established, and the international situation is now completely different from what it was then. Therefore, the treaty is no longer appropriate for Japan's safety. It is questionable whether the current provisions of the disarmament treaty are the most reasonable and economical. In short, Japan is dissatisfied with the current ratios and advocates changing these ratios at the next disarmament conference." (4th, Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's second supplementary plan for the navy has attracted much attention from countries around the world. This plan will be completed in 1936. At that time, the comparison of naval power between Japan and the United States will be as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Battleships: The disarmament treaty stipulates that no new ships may be built before the end of 1936. Japan will have nine ships, totaling 272,770 tons, and the United States will have fifteen ships, totaling 455,400 tons. The ratio is four to six.</p>
<p>(2) Aircraft Carriers: Japan's current strength is quite inferior, only 52%. However, with the establishment of the supplementary plan, two more ships will be added, that is, Japan will have five ships, totaling 80,770 tons, and the United States will have six ships, totaling 132,300 tons, changing to a level of 62%.</p>
<p>(3) Class A Cruisers: Japan cannot build new ships due to the treaty. It has a total of twelve ships, totaling 177,800 tons, and the United States has sixteen ships, totaling 151,650 tons. The ratio is 71%.</p>
<p>(4) Class B Cruisers: Japan has seventeen ships, totaling 100,450 tons, and the United States has fourteen ships, totaling 110,500 tons. The ratio is 99%.</p>
<p>(5) Destroyers: The destroyers in the supplementary plan will be completed in 1937. At that time, Japan will have seventy-nine ships totaling 105,396 tons, and the United States will have one hundred and sixteen ships totaling 145,400 tons. The ratio is 71%. However, sixty-nine of the American ships have exceeded their age limit, so Japan has the advantage.</p>
<p>(6) Submarines: Due to the disarmament treaty, both Japan and the United States have equal strength of 52,700 tons. (4th, Japan United Press)</p>
<h3>Tense Anglo-Irish Relations: Will Southern Ireland Become an Independent Republic?</h3>
<p>(London) It cannot be denied that there will be major changes in Ireland. Will Ireland be a republic, a free state, an independent country, or a colony? It will be decided within a few days. The British Cabinet convened a special meeting today to consider the situation in Ireland. It is reported that hopes for mediation have been completely dashed. The British government has warned the Irish Free State that if it does not make any concessions, it is expected that Dominions Secretary Thomas will deliver an important speech in the House of Commons tomorrow afternoon regarding the future of the Irish Free State, supplementing what he had already stated in the House of Commons on November 14. (4th, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) After Dominions Secretary Thomas explained the British government's attitude towards the constitutional bill submitted to Parliament by the Southern Irish Free State on November 14, Free State leader de Valera asked the British government whether the Free State could freely choose whether to remain a member of the British Empire or become a republic, without being subjected to pressure or intimidation from the British government. Therefore, the British Cabinet held a special meeting this morning to discuss the reply, which will be sent to de Valera tomorrow. Thomas is scheduled to state in the House of Commons tomorrow the future relationship between the Free State and the British Empire. This speech will be closely watched by people from both Britain and Ireland. (4th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The situation of the Blue Shirts in Southern Ireland resisting the de Valera government is becoming increasingly dangerous. Unified Party leader General O'Duffy delivered a speech to the public in the Macroom area yesterday, ignoring the authorities' ban. At the same time, the Blue Shirts blocked traffic around the area and cut telegraph and telephone lines. However, the police still entered the city through side roads, intending to quell the riots. It is expected that de Valera will take strong sanctions against the Blue Shirts leaders' open defiance. Both London and Dublin have not expressed any opinion on the situation. However, it is reported that Dominions Secretary Thomas has informed de Valera that the British government attaches great importance to the bill submitted to Parliament to remove the crown.

<h3>State of Alert Declared Throughout Spain: Royalists Plotting Restoration, Left-Wing Parties Plotting Uprising</h3>
<p>Madrid: There are rumors that the left-wing parties, due to their defeat in the recent general election, are attempting to stage an uprising to prevent the new parliament from convening on Friday. In about fifteen constituencies, because the elected members did not obtain the legal number of votes, a second vote must be held. How this will turn out cannot be predicted, and the current political situation is very chaotic. Now some people are campaigning to immediately trigger a cabinet reshuffle. A "state of alert" has been declared throughout the country so that the government can curb incidents at any time. After the parliament convenes, there is a risk of immediate dissolution, because most of the new members are royalists who are now plotting the restoration of former King Alfonso. The Republican Party now announces that elections should be held again and controlled by a united Republican front. The right-wing parties have gained a very strong position in this victory and will probably try their best to reverse the church laws implemented after Alfonso's abdication and pay particular attention to restoring confiscated properties. (3rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>Madrid: Today, there are revolutionary plots throughout Spain, but before they could start, they were detected by the police authorities, who took precautions, preventing them from succeeding. Those who attempted to revolt this time were anarcho-syndicalist elements. A state of martial law has now been declared throughout the province of Barcelona, and all the military weapons in shops throughout the country have been confiscated by the police authorities to prevent them from falling into the hands of rioters. All important military locations in various places are also guarded by the police. Today's election throughout the day was also in an uneasy state, and clashes between right-wing elements and Marxist parties were also heard from time to time. In the suburbs of Madrid, many rioters intended to set fire to a temple, but armed police arrived in time, dispersed the crowd, and fired guns at the crowd. Monks and nuns in various places have repeatedly been innocently attacked by rioters, to the point where they cannot fulfill their electoral obligations. In the suburbs of the capital, there were also many cars that were overturned and set on fire by the crowds because right-wing elements were using them to distribute leaflets. Rebellious incidents in various provinces are constantly emerging. As for the election, all the left-wing parties in the city of Madrid, from extreme socialists to communists, have voted in favor of the Socialist Party's list. Anti-Marxist parties, threatened by all sides, have given up voting. Therefore, as far as the capital is concerned, it is natural that the Socialist Party has won. (3rd, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Madrid: Today, Spain continued to elect one hundred and twenty-one members of parliament. Although there were some minor conflicts in several places, the overall situation was relatively peaceful. Because the Minister of the Interior had heard rumors that extremists were preparing to disrupt order, he announced a state of alert throughout the country and took strict precautions. As for the results of the election in the city of Madrid, they have already been announced. The Socialist Party won thirteen seats, and the right-wing party only won four seats.

He had already obtained the approval of Tokushichi Nomura, Fusajiro Kawabe, and Keijiro Horibe, and other financial circles in Kansai. Later, it was suspended due to funding issues.

<h3>Pan-American Conference Strives for Business Cooperation: Demands that the United States Abandon Hegemony in South America</h3>

<h3>Two Railways Continuously Repay Loans</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways previously announced that the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways would exert all efforts this year to repay debts. By the end of September, the total amount paid was approximately 3.2 million yuan. According to sources, since then, further payments have been made. On November 17, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway remitted half-year interest, including bank charges, on a loan due on May 18, 1932, totaling 1,076,023 yuan in national currency, equivalent to £69,774. On the same day, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway remitted half-year interest due on the same day, totaling 173,927 yuan in national currency, equivalent to £11,278. On December 2, the railway paid a portion of the 29th and 30th installments (totaling £75,187) due on November 17, 1932, and May 18, 1933, amounting to 939,900 yuan in national currency, equivalent to £60,000. The remaining balance of £15,187 is expected to be paid off by the end of this year. In total, 2,119,860 yuan was repaid this month.

After the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway repays the aforementioned balance of £15,187 by the end of this month, the total amount paid by the two railways this year will reach 5,700,000 yuan. It is anticipated that the equipment of the two railways will be better than before, and the profits will naturally be higher, so the outstanding debts should be cleared soon.

<h3>Social Situation in Fuzhou After the Fujian Incident: Changes to the Curriculum of Middle and Primary Schools; Shortage of Food, Panic</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the People's Government was established in Fujian Province, concerning education, finance, people's livelihood, and other matters, a summary is recorded here to inform those who are concerned about Fujian matters.</p>
<h3>Changes to Curriculum</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Cultural Committee, the committee members are Chen Mingshu, Wang Lixi, Xu Xiangmu, Peng Fangcao, Ouyang Yuqian, Lin Zhifu, and others, totaling fourteen people. Chen Mingshu serves as chairman. The former Fujian Provincial Department of Education has been taken over on the 24th. The Fujian Provincial Popular Education Literacy Association and all other cultural organizations have been completely taken over. On the one hand, personnel are assigned to various schools to promote so-called revolutionary people's education. On the other hand, they are proceeding to change the curriculum of middle and primary schools, centering on party ideology, with developing production and supporting farmers and workers as the standard for near-communist texts, in order to comply with the announced so-called production education policy.</p>
<h3>Financial Stringency</h3>
<p>Fuzhou's financial situation is dependent on the Shanghai market due to commercial relations. Therefore, since the incident, finance has also been unusually tight due to the stagnation of commerce. At the same time, after the Central Bank was confiscated, Central banknotes are no longer commonly used in the market, causing merchants to be unwilling to keep too many banknotes, focusing on accumulating cash for reserve. Currently, Fuzhou's silver and money businesses have stopped receiving and issuing bills that are normally used for transactions in order to prevent changes in the situation, making the market's finances feel even more inflexible. Therefore, in addition to resolving to tighten up, various silver and money businesses are also actively accumulating cash in preparation for future storms, which makes the market feel more short of cash, and commerce has become like a standstill.</p>
<h3>Food Panic</h3>
<p>Fujian Province's grain production has always been insufficient to meet demand. Both rice and wheat must rely on supplies from rice-producing provinces. Since the change in the political situation, the ports of Fujian have suddenly been blockaded by the Central Navy, resulting in the severance of the supply of rice and flour. As a result, the price of food in Fujian has soared. In one week, the price of white rice has risen by three to four yuan per dan, and the price of noodles has risen by five to six hundred wen per catty. If the foreign merchant ships no longer transport rice and flour to Fujian, then the price will inevitably rise again. Therefore, the hearts of the people in Fuzhou are panicked about food.

<h3>Guangdong Province's Three River Defenses: Eastern River Deploys Troops and Increases Defensive Works; Li Hanhun Enters Guangxi to Inquire About Li and Bai's Intentions; Western River and Xiaobei River Simultaneously Conduct Winter Defense; Two Hunan Army Brigades Take Over Defense in Southern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the Fujian Incident occurred, Guangdong has clearly expressed that it will not sympathize with Fujian, so it is very active in defending against Fujian. According to previous news, the Eastern River armies now have 30 regiments. The Independent First and Second Divisions are guarding Wu-Hang, Jiaoling, Raoping, and Huanggang, while the Third Army's Seventh and Eighth Divisions have also moved back from Xunwu to Pingyuan. The Fifth Division is stationed around Xingning. Xingning is located in a strategic location, serving as a shield for the provincial capital to the northeast. It can control Chaozhou and Meizhou to the east and is a place of military contention for the Eastern River. Therefore, in addition to building defensive works on the border, the authorities have also added two new artillery emplacements in the key locations of Xingning, requiring them to be completed by the date, from Xingning and down, Huizhou is the Eastern River into the provincial capital passage, the authorities recently sent the Independent Fourth Division Deng Longguang's two regiments, to guard, the second regiment of Deng's division Zhang Haodong's, has been stationed in Zijin by Huizhou city, the third regiment of Zhao Lan's by Boluo, transferred to places such as Danshui Pingshan Renshan, The division has recently established a training regiment, by the division's special service battalion and each regiment transferred a battalion into an army, the head of the regiment appointed Wang Dequan, after the regiment was established, stationed in Boluo Huizhou, to maintain public order, to the dangerous Feie Ridge of Huizhou, new giant cannons have been added recently, and there are new anti-aircraft guns, especially for air defense, The Eastern River had a large transportation team, but now because the Eastern River's military is tense, eight transportation teams are transferred from the Northern River's first transportation station, to the Eastern River, to benefit military transportation.</p>
<p>The situation on the Western River is temporarily quiet, but because Li Zongren has returned to Guangxi, has not been in Guangdong for a long time, and the outside world has recently heard that Li Jishen's entry into Fujian is related to Guangxi, and it is said that Li's representative has arrived in Yongning for many days, and although what is being discussed cannot be known, it is inevitable that Guangdong will be wary. In order to find out the steadfastness of Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi of Guangxi Province towards the current situation, on the 29th of last month, Li Hanhun, commander of the Independent Third Division, was sent to Guangxi, accompanied by his secretary, to inquire about Li and Bai's true opinions on the current situation. After receiving the order, Li Hanhun arrived in Wu on the 30th and transferred to a boat to Nanning, where he met Li and Bai. He stayed for about three days and then returned east to report. It is also said that since the Fujian incident occurred, the troops in Rong County, Teng County, and Rongxu in Guangxi Province have been trained more diligently, and personnel have been sent to actively reorganize the militia in Guilin, Pingle, Wuzhou, and Hexian districts, ordering the commanders of each district to go to various places to inspect the militia reserve, and sending members of the weapons association to the above-mentioned places to inspect the weapons of the military police and militia. At the same time, the Guangdong authorities also believe that it is necessary to rectify the Guangdong's Western River defenses in order to facilitate the suppression of bandits during the winter defense period. When Li Hanhun went up the Western River yesterday, he paid attention to inspecting Zhaoqing, Duchengt, Lianjiangkou, Deqing, and other places, and summoned the defense army for instructions. The authorities also plan to transfer Liu Bingchou's unit, the Second Regiment of the Garrison Brigade, from the Northern River to the Western River within days to be responsible for suppressing bandits. As for Liang Gongfu's unit, the Second Regiment of the Training Division, it will take care of the defenses of Xinxing and Liangyang and will postpone its transfer to the province.</p>
<p>There have also been new deployments of the Northern River defense army recently. Since He Jian of Hunan Province and Chen Jitang met in Yuechang on the 24th of last month, the Hunan army decided to send troops to assist in defending southern Jiangxi in the shortest possible time, so that Guangdong's First Army could be drawn back to the Northern River to suppress it. According to yesterday's news, two Hunan army brigades have left western Jiangxi for southern Jiangxi. The troops of the Independent Third Division originally stationed in Wujing, southern Jiangxi, have left for Shaoguan. As for the area bordering the Xiaobei River and Guangxi, which is usually defended by Chen Gongxia's regiment of the Independent Third Division, Pan Biao's regiment of the Independent Fourth Division has recently been sent from Yingde to assist in the defense of the Xiaobei River.

<h3>Lu Xingbang Telegraphed to Advise Cai Tingkai to Awaken - Enumerating Four Crimes, Exhausting His Faithful Advice -</h3>
<p>Since the Fujian Incident occurred, Lu Xingbang, commander of the newly organized Second Division, has moved his troops to northern Fujian and telegraphed Cai Tingkai, exhausting his final faithful advice. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To Director Cai of Fuzhou, In the past, when the Red bandits invaded Fujian, I sent a clear warning. Xingbang was ordered to conquer and fought for months. Fortunately, we relied on a common hatred of the enemy, and finally turned danger into safety. When the Commander-in-Chief discussed merit, it was the year of my division's reorganization. You believed that Xingbang's achievements were in the party-state and that he should be promoted, so you sent my division's deputy commander, Lu Xingrong, north with a letter to seek instructions from the Commander-in-Chief. Unexpectedly, the sail had not yet pointed to Jiujiang, and the rebellious flag had already been raised in Fujian, violating the law, disrupting discipline, and acting perversely. Xingbang must offer his faithful words to you. Since your army entered Fujian, they have held military and political power, spreading their claws and teeth everywhere, using prostitutes to handle major political affairs, and allowing soldiers and bandits to seize people's food, with taxes as numerous as hairs and exploitation reaching the bones, causing the four classes of people to lose their jobs and the villages to become ruins. That is the first crime. You have advocated for Thailand and Vietnam, forgetting the boundaries, respecting the Cantonese as sacred and treating the people of Fujian like cattle and horses, conferring high ranks on your fellow villagers, and selling your children and daughters to your relatives, treating us as if we are a doomed province. What freedom can be said to exist? That is the second crime. What is even worse is the killing of Chen Guohui, the imprisonment of He Xianzhu, the expulsion of Zhang Zhen, and the removal of Jiang Yan, either taking bribes and killing those who gave them, or seizing their credit and annexing their troops, acting insidiously and venomously. That is the third crime. You have declared independence, privately established a pseudo-government, changed the system and proclaimed a new era, and allied with the communists to surrender to Japan. That is the fourth crime. The enumeration of these four crimes includes all evils and is condemned by gods and men and intolerable by the law. If you can wake up early, the government will be able to forgive your past mistakes and hold you responsible for the future. If you remain stubborn and insist on acting arbitrarily, you will see the National Army come south, and everything will be destroyed. Xingbang will also lead the way, vowing to destroy you completely. Lu Xingbang, Commander of the Newly Organized Second Division, and all officers and soldiers salute." (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Guangdong Currency Crisis: Runs on the Provincial Bank Have Decreased; Financial Shortage Causes Many Silver Shops to Close</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the currency crisis occurred in Guangdong Province, in addition to announcing the suspension of redemption of ten-yuan notes, the government has been redeeming five-yuan and one-yuan notes at the Provincial Bank without restrictions every day. Therefore, five-yuan and one-yuan notes are still circulating as usual in the market. However, due to the shortage of cash, cash can only be received for transactions above six jiao. Since November 16, the Provincial Bank has redeemed approximately 2 million yuan in cash by November 26. Except for the Dongxing, Meilu, Beihai, and Nanxiong branches, which have always redeemed normally and have not been affected by the crisis, the other branches in Shaozhou, Haikou, and Jiangmen have experienced slight runs, but they were soon calmed down. The Jiangmen branch telegraphed yesterday that the run on the branch stopped on the 25th. The Zhongshan County branch also telegraphed that the run subsided on the 27th. As a result, the number of people redeeming at the provincial headquarters has also decreased day by day. It is estimated that only over 100,000 yuan in cash was redeemed on the 27th, and the same was true on the 28th. It is also said that the Provincial Bank previously offered real estate loans, but the government is now making every effort to reduce the amount of paper money in circulation, so it has been forced to temporarily suspend property mortgage loans. There is currently no plan to recover loans that have already been issued, because the current business situation is extremely depressed. If loans to merchants are recovered, it will further plunge businesses into despair.</p>
<p>In the business world, because import and export taxes have been reduced this year, the silk industry in Shunde, which is known as a major center, is not as good as before. Among the miscellaneous industries and large stores, there have been daily reports of closures before the end of the year. Silver shops have also felt strapped for cash because there are no opportunities to make loans and depositors have withdrawn their deposits one after another. Before the currency crisis occurred, large silver shops in the city, such as Zhaorong, Guangxin, Guanghe, and Hualong, suddenly closed due to the impact of gold price fluctuations, implicating six or seven others that collapsed at the same time. After the currency crisis began, the market's money supply became even shorter, making it difficult to circulate, and depositors were even more wary, so more people went to the silver shops to withdraw money than before. Therefore, Yuxiang and other shops, which have a long history of over 100 years, closed down a few days ago, owing me tens of thousands in debt. It was reported on the 27th that the Linghai Silver Business Company on Jianglan Street and the Dazhong Savings Bank in Xihuaikou also collapsed one after another, owing a huge amount of money. In view of this, if there is no relief measure for Guangdong's financial world, the future seems bleak. (November 29)</p>

<h3>Hunan and Guizhou Provinces Jointly Operate Civil Aviation - A Joint Venture Agreement Has Been Signed -</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Negotiations between the Hunan and Guizhou provincial governments for the joint operation of civil aviation have been ongoing for a long time and have now reached the stage of preliminary trial operations. A joint venture agreement is being signed, and the relevant personnel have been commissioned to organize a preparatory office for the Hunan-Guizhou Civil Aviation Bureau to promote the project. The following is a copy of the Hunan Provincial Government's response to the Guizhou Provincial Government: "Regarding the consultation, we refer to your Provincial Government's document No. 220, which stated that due to financial difficulties regarding the joint operation of Hunan-Guizhou aviation, you instructed the Department of Construction to draft another plan for preliminary trial operations, and specially dispatched Commander He Zhizhong to Hunan to discuss cooperative measures for implementation, and also forwarded a detailed plan. After reviewing the various sections of the detailed plan, they are deemed comprehensive and appropriate. We have dispatched Construction Department Director Cang Xia Chuan, and contacted Guizhou Department Director He Zhizhong, and drafted twelve articles of agreement based on the standards arrived at by the Department. Both parties have already tentatively sealed the agreement. According to Article 1 of the agreement, the director and deputy director of the preparatory office of the Zhejiang-Guizhou Civil Aviation Bureau, and the candidates for the members of the fund management committee, should be proposed, and we request that your government jointly appoint them in order to separately organize the office and the committee and proceed diligently.

If you agree, please issue appointment letters and send them to the government for joint printing and distribution. We also hope that you will select and appoint members for the preparatory office deputy director and fund management committee to be proposed by your government, and then send the appointment letters to Hunan for joint printing, so that the organization can be established as soon as possible to facilitate aviation administration." The important clauses stipulated in the contract are as follows: (1) First, a preparatory office for the Hunan-Guizhou Civil Aviation Bureau will be organized in Changsha. The Hunan and Guizhou provincial governments will each nominate one person to be jointly appointed as the director and deputy director, who will be solely responsible for the preparations. A fund management committee will be established as an organization to manage the fund and supervise its use. The members of the committee will be appointed by the two provincial governments, with three to four members from each province. (2) The preparatory period is tentatively set at six months. Upon expiration, it will be formally reorganized into the Hunan-Guizhou Civil Aviation Bureau. The director and deputy director will also be nominated by the two provincial governments and jointly appointed. (3) The two provincial governments will each raise 300,000 yuan to be used as a trial operation fund, to be paid in full within six months. (November 26th)</p>
<h3>Re-election of the Songjiang Chamber of Commerce Scheduled</h3>

Trade associations should be re-elected in advance, and representatives should be generated by the trade associations to join the County Chamber of Commerce. It is now found that there are still eight trade associations, such as the brick and tile industry, that have not been re-elected and have not yet been established. The County Party Department has repeatedly issued instructions urging them to do so. In recent days, the relevant industries have been rushing to hold elections.

<h3>Fire at the Foot of Junshan Mountain in Nantong</h3>
<p>A small town at the foot of Junshan Mountain in Nantong, on the night of the 2nd, a fire suddenly broke out in Wang Hanlin's house. It spread to twelve houses and burned one person surnamed Wang, who was sent to Nantong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Military and Police Implement Joint Defense on Land and Water</h3>
<p>The Tongyi military and police, with the approach of the winter defense period, specially convened a joint defense meeting to allocate and deploy the provincial and county water and land police forces.

Simultaneous general searches were conducted in each district, and patrols and sentry meetings were held.</p>
<h3>The Suzhou Monks and Nuns Love Affair Case is Dismissed by the High Court Prosecutor's Office in Accordance with the Law</h3>
<p>The sensational love affair between monks and nuns in the Baiyi Temple in Tianji Lane, outside the city of Suzhou and Shanghai, was reported. The monk Huigen was reported by the nun Wang Meiying of Choufu Temple in Zhuangjia Bridge Lane to the Public Security Bureau, and then transferred to the Wuxian District Court. After investigation by the local prosecutor's office, the charges of seduction and abandonment against the monk Wang Meiying were dismissed. Wang Meiying refused to accept the decision and applied to the High Court for reconsideration. Now the High Court Prosecutor's Office has rejected it in accordance with the law. The original disposition of the High Court is recorded as follows: Applicant: Wang Meiying; Defendant: Huigen. The applicant sued the defendant for seduction and abandonment. The non-prosecution disposition made by the Wuxian District Court Prosecutor's Office on November 12, 1933, was appealed for reconsideration. After review by the Chief Prosecutor, the disposition is as follows: Wang Meiying, the applicant in this case, and the defendant, the monk Huigen, although they once cohabited due to adultery, is ultimately an immoral union. Since they could cohabit, they could also separate, so there is no question of abandonment. As for consensual adultery with an unmarried woman over the age of sixteen, there is no explicit punishment in the criminal law, and no criminal issue arises. The original disposition recognized that the defendant's behavior did not constitute a crime and did not prosecute, which is not inappropriate. Except for the allegation in the application that fraud was used to make the woman mistakenly believe that there was a marital relationship and that she was seduced, the original disposition did not mention this because the applicant did not originally make this claim. Therefore, it cannot be suddenly appealed for reconsideration. All parts of the seduction and abandonment should be deemed unreasonable in accordance with the above explanation and rejected in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 250 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Hu Yigu, Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Court (seal).</p>
<h3>Various Counties Request Dispatch of Police to Defend Against Bandits</h3>

District Chief Wei Zhanyuan of the district has recently received petitions from citizens in Kunshan, Changshu, Wuxi, and Hengjing, Dongting, and Xishan in this county, stating that bandits are rampant during the winter defense period, and the original garrisoned water police have been ordered to reorganize, causing public concern. They requested that police teams be dispatched quickly to maintain law and order. District Chief Wei presented the previous situation, stating that after the reorganization, the number of personnel was reduced and the jurisdiction was vast, which was insufficient for distribution. Therefore, it was decided to go to the province today (5th) to personally meet with Director Changmin to request instructions.</p>

<p>The widening of Sanxiatang Street in the city has been repeatedly urged by local people. It was initiated in the autumn of this year. County Magistrate Yan drafted a plan and, taking into account the situation, reduced the originally planned widening scale, which was submitted to the Department of Construction for approval. The required funds have also been raised. The Municipal Engineering Office has measured the gray lines and erected center stakes, and it has been decided to implement it within the year. The houses of residents Zou Xiaolu and Gu Zhongchen, etc., within the route have also been demolished voluntarily. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 3rd, residents in the area, believing that the widening of the street was inevitable, gathered at the Jiayi Clan Hall to hold a meeting and discussion. More than 400 people attended. They all believed that at this time of the year, with the year-end approaching and economic difficulties, the demolition of houses would result in huge losses. It is estimated that the demolition costs for the 400 to 500 residents within the route would require about one million yuan. It was decided to submit a request to the county government to postpone the implementation. Zou Xiaolu and Gu Zhongchen were deemed to have acted improperly by voluntarily demolishing their houses in advance. More than 100 representatives, including Yang Musu, Li Shi'an, and Gu Zhuan, were elected to discuss with the Zou and Gu families to take into account the public interest. It was also noted that Central Committee member Miao Kai also lived within the route. If it were demolished, the losses would be even greater. The representatives specially went to the Citizen Convenience Office to meet with Committee member Miao and requested that representative Chen Lan find a way to preserve it. Yesterday morning, the residents' representatives again submitted petitions to the government and the Management Committee. Among the representatives were widows and poor households who cried and pleaded, telling their plight to everyone they met. It has been decided that County Magistrate Yan and Municipal Management Committee Chairman Gu, etc., will visit their residences today (the 5th) to resolve the matter so that the implementation can be carried out smoothly.</p>
<h3>A Primary School Girl Kidnapped in Changzhou Xinfang Bridge</h3>
<p>Wang Wu, of Guanzi Lane in Shiyi County, lost her husband, Wang Shouzhi, many years ago. She left behind three children. Her second daughter, Wang Zhaowen, is ten years old and is studying in the second grade at Xinfang Bridge Primary School. On the afternoon of the 22nd of last month, around 1:00 PM, she was suddenly tricked away from school by someone pretending to be from her home. Wang Wu did not see her daughter return home in the evening, so she went out to inquire. She suspected that Fan Rongsheng, who lived in Luohan Bridge, had abducted her. On the evening of the 2nd, Wang Wu's neighbor, Xiao Heshang, encountered Fan Xirong. Fan was guilty and tried to escape, but was caught and taken to Wang Wu's house, and then transferred to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. After Chief Sun Meicheng interrogated him late into the night, Fan confessed to the abduction and sale. He also confessed two accomplices, Luo Wengan and Li Bing. On the 3rd, police were dispatched to arrest the two criminals. After further interrogation, the two criminals provided detailed information about the abduction process. They also claimed that the girl Wang Ningwen had already been sold in Shanghai, earning 100 yuan, which they shared. Chief Sun believed that the case was about the abduction and sale of a girl, which was a serious crime, so he sent the details of the case, along with the three arrested criminals, to the county for trial today (the 4th).</p>
<h3>Major Fire in Zhangjiazhuang South, Gaoyou</h3>
<p>At Wu Cheng's house in Zhangjiazhuang South, District 2 of the county, around 9:00 PM the night before last, a fire was accidentally left under the stove while preparing dinner, causing a conflagration. The alarm was immediately raised, and neighbors came to put out the fire, but there was no effective way to extinguish it, causing it to spread to the Xu, Li, and Zhang families, burning more than ten rooms and causing considerable losses.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Relief Institute Ordered to Reorganize</h3>

<h3>The Electric Light Company Continues to Purchase New Machines</h3>
<p>The Tiejiang Dachao Electric Steam Company, due to the increasing number of users and the increase in the number of lamps, and the old generators not being sufficient for use, specially sent staff to Shanghai to order a new Siemens generator. It is reported that the value is more than 200,000 yuan, and it will not be shipped to Zhenjiang for two or three months.</p>
<h3>Yixing Military and Police Implement Winter Defense</h3>
<p>Li Bo, the battalion commander of the First Battalion of the Third Regiment of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Force stationed in Yixing, has now been publicly elected as the director of the joint office for military and police winter defense, and declared the implementation of winter defense on the 1st of this month. At 6:00 PM on the same afternoon, the first office meeting was convened.</p>
<h3>Three Cases of Arson by Bandits in Jiashan</h3>
<p>As the winter season arrives, the fierce bandits in the northern countryside are rampant, and incidents of robbery and arson are often heard. They are recorded as follows: (1) The house of farmer Ren Axiao in Donglugang was visited by a group of fierce bandits last night, about ten or more people. In addition to looting everything, they also set fire to the house. Fire oil was poured on the straw, and the fire was raging, with no one to put it out. All the tiled houses were reduced to ashes. (2) At the same time, a farmer surnamed Pu in Louyan was also looted by bandits, and his residence was set on fire before they left, resulting in considerable losses. (3) In the Leiyuan Teahouse in Chaonitan Town, which borders Songjiang County and this county, a large number of gang members openly set up gambling stalls, with large sums of money involved. As a result, several families, including the Xu family in the nearby Jiaoli, were looted by the gang members. The victim Xu Xiaoxiang was tied up and tortured, and 10,000 yuan in cash was extorted.</p>
<h3>Guanshen Maintain Order as Troops Pass Through Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Since the Fujian Incident, troops such as the 88th Division and supplementary regiments have been transferred from the provincial capital to Xiaoshan to cross the river and take the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road to Quzhou. There are also teams of horses and military supplies that have not been able to catch up in time and are stationed at the Xiaoshan Southern Goods Guild Hall and the Lao Yue Temple. The county government, in order to maintain order as the troops passed through, specially convened a maintenance meeting of gentry and merchants yesterday to raise funds and supply everything. Today (the 3rd), a large number of troops are temporarily stationed in Xiaoshan, awaiting orders to be dispatched.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<h3>Letter from the Traffic Department of the Yuehan Railway Hunan-Hubei Section Management Bureau</h3>
<p>I have reviewed the "Inspection Report on the Gan-Yue-Wan-Xiang-E" column in your newspaper on October 24th, which stated that an inspector Zhang of the Ministry of Railways, when passing through the Guanpu Station by train, leaned his head out of the window, and his hat was blown off by the wind. He negotiated with the car attendant to stop the train and reversed to look for it, delaying the train for three quarters of an hour. Those responsible for maintaining railway regulations are requested to pay attention to this. I immediately ordered the section chief in charge of the section to investigate and reply. The reply stated, "Upon receiving instructions to investigate and reply regarding the statement in the Shenbao on October 24th that Railway Ministry Inspector Zhang leaned his head out of the window when passing through Guanpu Station, and his hat was blown off by the wind. He negotiated with the car attendant to agree to reverse the train to search for it, delaying the train for three quarters of an hour, whether this is true, etc. This case was investigated before receiving your order. On September 17, the eighth train had a stopping incident. I immediately instructed the on-duty train conductor of the eighth train on that day, Hei Zhenhua, to reply, 'Regarding the reply, I received your telegram No. 39, ordering a detailed reply on the reason for the eighth train stopping between Bai and Zhu on September 17. Upon investigation, the eighth train on that day, when passing the Xiaotangkuo uphill slope between Baiguanpu and Zhuzhou South stations, the engine's fire pound dropped, and the traction force was greatly reduced. Therefore, it retreated and stopped to level and refill steam, which took about seven or eight minutes before it was fully raised and started again. There were no other matters. I am replying with this document for your review.'" After receiving the order, I further investigated and found that in the 92 days, in addition to September 17, there were no other trains that had accidents between Zhu and Bai. Therefore, I am replying with this document based on the situation for your review. The engine in this railway has been used for many years and is often damaged, especially the small engine installed in Zhuping. It often reverses and retreats to a level road to burn enough steam and pounds so that it is easier to drive over the slope. The report in your newspaper is not a mistake. Accordingly, I am sending this letter in conjunction with a request for your newspaper to investigate and publish it. This is the Traffic Department of the Yuehan Railway Hunan-Hubei Section Management Bureau to Shenbao. November 30, 1933.</p>

<h3>Mo Dehui and Wang Jiazhen Returned to China and Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Zhang Xueliang is Waiting for a Ship to Return to China, Mo Will Stay in Shanghai Briefly and Then Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>Mo Dehui, the former plenipotentiary representative of our country sent to the Soviet Union to attend the Sino-Soviet conference, went to Germany for treatment after the September 18th Incident. Shortly after, he transferred to Rome, Italy, for a short stay for many years. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Mo and his wife, along with Wang Jiazhen, the former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and his family, returned to China from Europe on the Italian postal ship Conte Rosso. Mo will rest briefly in Shanghai before going to Beijing to report everything to the Central Government, and then go north. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Arrival Situation</h3>
<p>Mo, accompanied by his wife, attendants, and former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Jiazhen, Zhang Xueliang's secretary Li Yingchao and his wife, a total of five people, left Europe on the Italian ship Conte Rosso on October 10th and arrived in Shanghai at around 4:00 PM yesterday. The ship docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. The Foreign Affairs Office specially dispatched Zhao Tiezhang, the section chief of the Shanghai office, together with Tang Shixuan, the secretary representing Mayor Wu, to welcome them at the wharf. At 5:00 PM, they disembarked at the Jianghai Customs Wharf and returned to their respective accommodations. Li Yingchao and his wife returned to Guangdong to visit relatives after arriving in Hong Kong one day earlier and did not come to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Newly Recovered from a Long Illness</h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Mo made a brief statement to reporters, saying that he had traveled in Europe for more than four years. He originally intended to return to China earlier, but due to ill health, he left Russia for Germany for treatment the year before last, which lasted about half a year. He then went to Italy for rest, which also lasted half a year. Recently, because his illness has slightly improved, he left Europe to return to China. However, his spirit is still not good, and with the journey and transportation, he still feels dizzy after arriving in Shanghai. Therefore, he did not meet with any guests.</p>
<h3>Entering Beijing to Go to Tianjin</h3>
<p>While in Italy, he met with Zhang Hanqing in Rome. Zhang is in good spirits and his health is stronger than before. Zhang is now very interested in returning to China, but when he can leave Europe depends on the shipping schedule, so it is unknown whether he can leave Europe within a month. He himself plans to rest in Shanghai for three to five days, and then go to Beijing, and plans to go to North China because his family is still in Tianjin, he said.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Discusses the Fujian Incident Again, The Military Strength of Fujian Province is Less Than Three Divisions, Central Government Troops are on the Zhejiang Border for Strict Defense</h3>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report from Hong Kong, the Guangdong authorities telegraphed Beijing on the 1st, proposing five conditions for mediating the Fujian Incident. Yesterday morning, a Central News Agency reporter specifically inquired about this to Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, at his residence. According to his conversation, as follows:</p>
<h3>No News of Mediation by Guangdong</h3>
<p>Regarding the claim that the Guangdong authorities telegraphed Beijing on the 1st, proposing five conditions for mediating the Fujian Incident, I have not heard of it. It is said that Hong Kong newspapers have also published this news. As for whether this is true or not, I left Beijing for Shanghai on the evening of the 30th, so I have no way of knowing. But I believe it is definitely not true.</p>
<h3>The Military Strength of Fujian is Less Than Three Divisions</h3>
<p>The rebellion in Fujian is purely Chen Mingshu's proposition. He does not hesitate to sacrifice the extremely glorious 19th Route Army for his personal opinion. Although the strength of the 19th Route Army has been increased by three divisions since the opening of Fujian, they are all new troops with no combat power. The elite troops of the Ou Shou Nian's department sacrificed more than half of their forces during the suppression of the communists, and all three regiments were wiped out. Therefore, although the army is said to have 50,000 to 60,000 people, those who can fight are less than three divisions. Although the province has concluded a treaty with the Jiangxi bandits, it must also station a portion of its troops on the Jiangxi border, so it has no real strength to advance outward. To prevent the army from rushing in, the Southwest authorities have strictly guarded the Guangdong border, with troops stationed there reaching more than five divisions. As for the Central Government troops on the Zhejiang border, there are 80,000 of them. Therefore, once the campaign begins, it is expected to be resolved within a month. Many in the 19th Route Army are dissatisfied with Chen and others' actions. When the war breaks out, a portion of the army will definitely return to the Central Government, it can be asserted. Therefore, Chen Mingshu's actions are extremely foolish, willingly becoming the second Chen Jiongming.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Plenary Session Will Be Held on Schedule</h3>
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session is scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 20th of this month. There are many cases to be discussed at the meeting. All matters concerning resisting foreign aggression, quelling internal rebellion, and reorganizing the administration of various provinces will be submitted to the meeting for discussion. As for the rumors that the Central Government's order to suppress the Fujian province will be passed and announced at the meeting, this is not true. The government has the right to suppress any rebels.</p>
<h3>The Economic Commission Establishes Two Offices</h3>
<p>To facilitate the promotion of provincial affairs, the National Economic Commission has decided to establish offices in the Northwest and Jiangxi. The Northwest office will be located in Xi'an, specializing in the construction affairs of various Northwest provinces, such as rural relief and water conservancy projects. The location of the Jiangxi office has not yet been determined. However, as the bandit areas in the province are gradually recovered, rural relief and the revitalization of various industries are the most urgent tasks. Therefore, it will be established soon. As for the establishment of the Grain Control Committee, it has not yet been finalized due to the incomplete selection of committee members. Moreover, grain control requires a huge amount of funding, so it cannot proceed without substantial funds.</p>
<h3>Drafting of the Constitution to be Completed Early Next Year</h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan's drafting of the Constitution has been accelerated by the Constitution Drafting Committee. It is expected to be completed by January next year, and a draft can be published in April. After the draft constitution is published, opinions from all sectors of the country will be solicited for revision. It will then be submitted to the National Congress in April of the 24th year of the Republic of China for approval and promulgation.</p>
<p>Sun Ke, Zhu Jiahua, Ma Chaojun, Liu Ruiheng, Zou Lin, Jiao Yitang, and others took the night express to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>Smooth Communication of Shanghai-Fujian Telegrams Proves There is No War Temporarily</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the Fujian Incident, shipping between Shanghai and Fujian has been affected due to the Central Government's blockade of Fujian ports. Telegraphs between Shanghai and Fujian are the only source of communication between the two places, so all parties have paid close attention to this. A few days ago, in the 28th Capital area on the border of Zhejiang and Fujian, a telegraph pole was blown down by the wind and crossed with a telephone line, causing temporary obstruction. It was repaired by the local engineering staff and is now operating normally. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited Mr. Hua Shijian, the business manager of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, to inquire about the bureau's business, and the following was reported:</p>
<h3>Blown-down Telegraph Pole Unrelated to Military Affairs</h3>
<p>At 8 p.m. on the 2nd, a telegraph pole was broken and crossed the line in the 28th Capital area on the border of Zhejiang and Fujian, hindering communication. Rumors spread outside. The reason for the broken telegraph pole was that a long-distance bus route was being built nearby, so some telegraph poles along the road needed to be moved. Temporary wooden poles were erected, and they were blown down by a strong wind, or because the temporary wooden poles were not firmly installed. It has nothing to do with military affairs. It has now been ordered to repair the work and report as usual.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Fujian Telegrams Busiier Than Before</h3>
<p>In view of the current tense situation, the Bureau has noticed that the line is very important. Therefore, it has notified Zhao, the engineer in charge of the line, and specially ordered the line patrolmen of each section to pay attention to it at any time. Since the Fujian Incident, the receipt and dispatch of telegrams between Shanghai and Fujian have become busier than before. Roughly, more than 400 telegrams are sent from Shanghai every day, and more than 300 telegrams are received from Fujian. At this time of tension and panic, more attention should be paid to protection to avoid obstruction and cause public unrest. As for the telegraph branch in Fujian Province, because it is related to the 19th Route Army, it can still work as usual, and there is no takeover or change of personnel. Moreover, the Bureau is a business organization, and although there are political changes, it will not affect the business of the Bureau.</p>
<h3>Blocking Fujian Telegrams is Not Accurate</h3>
<p>Regarding the rumors of war between Zhejiang and Fujian, it has not been confirmed until this moment. If a war were to occur between Fujian and Zhejiang, the telegraph lines passing through the border between Zhejiang and Fujian, which are operated by the Bureau, would be affected. However, according to the current situation, communication between the two parties is still unimpeded. As for the rumors that the Ministry of Communications will block telegrams in Fujian Province, it is not accurate. The Bureau has never received such instructions from the Ministry of Communications, which shows that it is unfounded.</p>
<h3>Tianchu Airplane Accessories Shipped from Germany Yesterday - Central Government Sends Engineer Beile to Shanghai for Assembly</h3>
<p>The Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory donated a Junkers all-metal fighter plane. On July 14 this year, when the seller made the first test flight before delivery, the propeller and fuel tank were damaged during landing due to the mediocre skills of the pilot. After several negotiations between the Tianchu Factory and the Jardine Engineering Corporation, which sold the aircraft, and after the mediation of Wang Boxiu, the director of the Central Aviation School Factory, the seller also agreed to replace all the damaged parts in consideration of its reputation. They also agreed to deliver the all-metal Five-Zero trainer plane, which was for sale in Beiping, to the Tianchu Factory unconditionally as compensation. These accessories were carried by the Italian postal ship "Conte Rosso", which entered the port at 3:30 p.m. yesterday. As for the assembly procedures, according to Mr. Fang of the Tianchu Factory to the China East News Agency reporter yesterday, because the main components such as the engine are completely undamaged, it only takes four or five days of work to complete. The accessories that arrived include the propeller, fuel tank, wheel disk, steel middle skin, etc. As for the assembly personnel, the Central Aviation School Factory has assigned a German engineer, Beile (transliteration), to Shanghai to be responsible for the assembly. Mr. Bei will arrive here from Beijing in the next few days. Once he arrives in Shanghai, he will have to disassemble and oil the entire aircraft. Because the work takes time, the naming ceremony may not be held on the 15th. The Aviation School also sent a telegram the day before yesterday, urging that the trainer plane in Beiping be flown to Shanghai immediately.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telephone Bureau's Pudong Branch Begins Installation Today - Dismantling of Cross-Border Telephones Scheduled for the 15th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, based on the temporary contract, negotiated with the Shanghai Telephone Company to recover the management rights. After the establishment of the Pudong Branch, it will begin to install state-owned telephones today. Dialing will be available on the 10th, and the dismantling of cross-border telephones will begin on the 15th. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Pudong Branch</h3>
<p>All telephones installed in shops and residences in Pudong are telephones of the Shanghai Telephone Company. The total number is 78 units. The cost per unit per quarter is 61 taels and 6 qian (due to the river crossing water line problem, it is more than twice as high as in Puxi), and an annual rent of 60 yuan must be paid to the Telephone Bureau. The Telephone Bureau, based on the telephone temporary contract, formally established the Pudong Branch on November 30 after repeated negotiations.</p>
<h3>Prescribed Prices</h3>
<p>The Telephone Bureau stipulates the prices for users in Pudong: (1) Machine deposit of 50 yuan, (2) Installation fee of 20 yuan (10 yuan for extensions), (3) Monthly rent, 15 yuan for shops, 12 yuan for households (the rent is 7 yuan and 10 yuan everywhere, the price in Pudong is slightly higher due to the water line), (4) 40 free calls for Chinese rented residential phones, 80 calls for shops, with three minutes per call. If the specified number of calls is exceeded, a telephone fee of 5 cents per call will be paid according to regulations.</p>
<h3>Installation Today</h3>
<p>As of yesterday, more than 50 shops of the Fifth District Party Headquarters and other residents and businesses in Pudong have applied for installation. The Pudong Branch is scheduled to start installing new user telephone sets today, and will officially start dialing on the 10th. All cross-border telephone sets are scheduled to be dismantled and replaced with state-owned telephone sets on the 15th.</p>
<h3>US Minister Johnson Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the Ta Mei Wan Bao, US Minister Johnson, after traveling in the southern part of China, is expected to return to Shanghai on the President Coolidge this afternoon (4th). It is said that he will stay in Shanghai for a short time, and then take the road to Nanjing and return to Beiping.</p>
<h3>Alas, the Last of the Anti-Japanese Generals - City Public Security Bureau Arrests Wang Yang Based on Secret Report - Briefly Interrogated and Ordered to Return to Custody</h3>
<p>Since the signing of the Tanggu Agreement, for several months, the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, trapped in the eastern four provinces, except for those who have changed their allegiance, surrendered, reorganized, or disbanded, has been fighting a desperate battle. The real Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, who vowed to coexist with the land, is small in number. Moreover, the support from the mainland is no longer as enthusiastic as in the past, so the situation is even more difficult. For example, the Third Route Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, commanded by Wang Gongjue, originally had three or four thousand men. Recently, due to the cessation of supplies and the lack of both salaries, in order to preserve its strength, they came to Shanghai a month ago and initially resided at No. 410, Cihou North Lane, Hartung Road, at the home of his adviser, Yang Xianfu. Yang was the son of Yang Xiaochuan, who served as the Shanghai Commissioner of Foreign Affairs during the Beijing government. He was originally the Dean of Academics at a university. He had an old friendship with Gongjue. Half a year ago, he was invited by Gongjue to cooperate and serve as an adviser. Therefore, Gongjue stayed at his home, planning to raise funds. If he could raise a considerable amount, he decided to return to the Northeast and continue the Anti-Japanese War. If it was difficult to raise funds, he would write to Chiang Kai-shek, the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, requesting the reorganization of his troops to avoid the displacement of seasoned soldiers. However, neither of these two plans has been grasped so far, and it is not possible to go north in the short term. Now they have moved to No. 437, Cihou North Lane, waiting for Chairman Chiang to approve it. However, according to a secret report, the City Public Security Bureau said that Wang Gongjue was forming a party in Shanghai, selling official positions under the guise of Anti-Japanese War, and defrauding money. Director Wen immediately sent Inspector Zhou Genrui to the Jing'an Temple Police Station at 8 a.m. the day before yesterday. He added West Detective Hua Sheng and Detective Qian Xianting to rush to Wang's residence and arrest Gongjue. Eighteen registers of appointments of all kinds, and thirty-nine seals of various forms, were confiscated. Among them, there was a seal of the Third Route Army Commander of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army with the seal in scarlet color. Then, he went to Yang's house and arrested Yang Xianfu. Two registers of appointments and fifty envelopes printed with Wang Gongjue's name were also confiscated and taken to the police station for detention. Two other accomplices escaped after hearing the news and could not be found. Yesterday morning, the police station took Wang and Yang, along with the evidence, to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Wu Tingqi conducted a preliminary hearing. First, Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, stated the process of assisting the city's public security bureau's detectives in arresting the two defendants and the defendants' confessions at the police station. Then, Zhan Jifeng, the legal counsel of the city's public security bureau, requested a transfer. Wang and others hired two lawyers to object and debated with Zhan for a long time. Judge Wu then briefly questioned Wang and Yang, and ordered that Wang Gongjue and Yang Xianfu, along with the evidence, be taken away by the city's public security bureau to be investigated.</p>
<h3>Memorial Today for the Zhaochang Warship Uprising</h3>
<p>Today is the 18th anniversary of the Zhaochang warship uprising. All sectors of the city have specifically scheduled a memorial meeting at the City Party Headquarters on LinYin Road and the Chinese Seamen's Union on Wengjia Branch Road in Ximen at 9 a.m. this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>City Party Headquarters Notice</h3>
<p>The City Party Headquarters issued a notice to various agencies, groups, schools, trade unions, and party departments at all levels, stating: "For the purpose of notification, December 5th is the 18th anniversary of the Zhaochang Warship Uprising. The Association will convene representatives from all sectors at the auditorium of the Party Headquarters at 9:00 a.m. on the morning of that day to hold a memorial meeting.

I have asked the Minister to consider and select another acting candidate, but my request was not approved. I have to reluctantly take on the task. Fortunately, the post office has a history of several decades, and everything has rules to follow. Moreover, the bureau's staff at all levels are all deeply experienced and rich in experience.

<h3>Jiangsu Province Continues to Borrow Money from Banks to Set Up Warehouses - Shanghai Bank Loan of 600,000 Already Contracted - China Bank Loan of 400,000 Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has decided to set up 51 warehouses in various counties of Jiangsu to revitalize the countryside, consolidate grain, and increase production. The estimated cost is about one million yuan. Zhao Dihua, the Director of the Finance Department, specially appointed Yang Fengshu, the President of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, to represent the province in Shanghai to contact the Shanghai banking community to borrow money. Yang negotiated with Chen Guangfu, the President of Shanghai Bank, and agreed to use the grain in each warehouse as collateral, and the bank lent a short-term loan of 600,000 yuan. The contract has been signed with very low interest. After Yang returned to the province to report, he said that the estimated expenses were still huge. The provincial treasury was very tight, and it was difficult to find another way for a while. Therefore, Yang came to Shanghai from Zhenjiang again yesterday to continue to borrow money from the banking community, and has begun to contact Zhang Gongquan of the Bank of China. The amount of this loan is 400,000 yuan, and the grain in each warehouse will still be used as collateral. It is expected that the formalities will be negotiated within a few days. In addition to Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other three counties that have already allocated funds for establishment, which are limited to be established within the year, the remaining county warehouses have also been ordered to actively prepare for establishment.</p>

<h3>Record of the Meeting of the German Engineers Association Chinese Branch</h3>
<p>On the 1st of this month, the Chinese Branch of the German Engineers Association invited the German-Austrian-Swiss Student Association and the Tongji Alumni Association to hold a get-together at the Chinese YMCA and invited Dr. Wagenna, a professor at Tongji University, to speak on "New Developments in Locomotives." After the chairman of the association, Mr. Qi Man, reported, Dr. Wagenna was invited to begin his speech. From the many films he showed, you can see the gradual development of steam locomotives and their loads. In his discussion of the locomotives that are needed for the economy, he mentioned that the following two points should be noted: (1) The repair costs of locomotives must be reduced. For example, use locomotives of the same type so that the parts of the various cars can be interchanged with each other. (2) Under certain capabilities, the fuel of the locomotive must be saved. For example, use high-pressure steam (60 to 120 steam pressure) or use steam turbines to start the locomotive. Dr. Wagenna also used films to explain the structure of the new type of locomotives and explained the results of many tests on saving fuel, which was about 25% to 30% of that used by previous locomotives. Finally, he discussed locomotives using diesel engines, whose fuel can be saved even more. His discussions were all based on the locomotives that German locomotive factories made for the United States, Japan, South Africa, Russia, and Germany itself. After the speech was completed, it was warmly welcomed by the audience, and then a tea party was held. The chairman of the association hopes that there will be such Sino-German get-togethers in the future so that we can learn from each other. All those who attended expressed their agreement.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Submits a Request to the Ministry of Finance to Reduce Factory Taxes on Yarn, Flour, etc. Reducing Factory Taxes Will Lower the Cost of Domestic Goods, Allowing Imported Goods to Naturally Disappear Without Resistance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "Respectfully to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, we received a letter dated the second of this month from the Joint Federation of Chambers of Commerce of Shanxi Province, stating that the Second Session of the Federation's Members' Congress had transferred a proposal from the Pingyao County Chamber of Commerce, requesting the central government to reduce factory tax rates to support domestic goods and prevent financial leakage. We believe that the current trade deficit is alarming, and to prevent financial leakage, it is essential to support domestic goods, and to support domestic goods, it is particularly important to reduce tax rates. Since the abolition of likin, the tax rates set by the central government for various factory taxes have been excessively high. For example, the factory tax on cotton yarn is 8.39 yuan per package, the factory tax on flour is 0.10 yuan per bag, and the factory tax on matches is 10 yuan per case, which is several times higher than in previous years. With such high tax rates, high costs, and difficulty in achieving low prices, foreign goods are dumped, and domestic goods fail. The yarn factories in Yuci and Xinzhou, the flour factories in Taiyuan and Yuci, and the match factories in Taiyuan, Pingyao, Fenyang, and Xinzhou are not thriving or have even closed down, not due to poor management, but due to the excessive burden of factory taxes. Cotton yarn is related to people's clothing, flour is related to people's food, and matches are related to people's daily use. All three are essential for people's livelihood. If no measures are taken to provide relief, not only will commerce be affected, but also the people's livelihood will be greatly affected. How can we prevent financial leakage and promote domestic goods? It is proposed that the Congress make a public decision to request the Ministry of Finance to reduce taxes, and to telegraph all national and provincial chambers of commerce federations to provide assistance. Approved. We believe that our country's production is backward, and everything from a thread to a strand has been imported from abroad. Recently, although a small number of factories have been able to resist, the heavy factory taxes make it difficult to compete. As a result, despite years of promotion, foreign goods still flood the market, and the amount of financial leakage each year is heartbreaking. If we do not take urgent measures to remedy the situation, we will face national demise and racial extinction. The only way to provide relief is to fundamentally reduce factory tax rates so that the cost of domestic goods is low and sales can be promoted, and imported goods will naturally disappear without resistance. Based on the foregoing, in addition to the Chamber of Commerce directly submitting a request to the Ministry of Finance, we hereby telegraph all parties to unanimously advocate for assistance to achieve the goal. We await instructions with utmost anxiety." When the message arrived at the meeting, it was noted that cotton yarn, matches, and other items have been taxed according to the measures for machine-made foreign goods. Since the implementation of the consolidated tax system, a separate tax rate has been set, which is indeed heavier than before. This year, due to the increase in tariffs, the consolidated tax on cotton yarn has also increased. At a time when commerce is sluggish and sales are stagnant, merchants and people feel even more unable to cope. The authorities intend to say that although the domestic consolidated tax has been increased, it is still lower than import tariffs. Although foreign merchants have national power as their backing and take advantage of the low exchange rate, the tax items have increased, but the selling price is lower. How can Chinese factories compare with them? Shanxi's products have always regarded the neighboring provinces as sales markets. Since Hebei and Chahar have been devastated by military affairs and Japanese goods have flooded in, failure has followed one after another, and they have reached a point where they cannot recover. It is urgent for your ministry to cultivate and protect them so that they can recover. We sincerely request that you approve the request of the Joint Federation and handle it appropriately for the public benefit. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce kowtows, winter."</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed Request to Postpone the Increase in Consolidated Cigarette Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Joint Association of Cigarette Factory Owners, after the Ministry of Finance issued an order to increase the consolidated cigarette tax, cigarette merchants are unable to bear the burden and specially telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry, stating: "Respectfully to General Commander Chiang of the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, and Shanghai Tax Office in Nanjing, we received a letter from the Chinese Cigarette Factory Association stating that according to the Ministry's order, the consolidated cigarette tax has been increased, with the tax for the first grade being 160 yuan and the tax for the second grade being 80 yuan. In recent years, the smuggling of cigarettes has initially been only one or two boxes per month, but now it has increased to more than 10,000 boxes. If the tax is increased again, smuggling will become even more rampant, and both officials and merchants will be in trouble. It is proposed to first rectify the smuggling of cigarettes and temporarily postpone the tax increase. Even if the tax is increased, it must be examined in light of the commercial situation and should not be too heavy so that merchants and factories can barely bear the burden. We respectfully request that you approve the request, which would be greatly appreciated. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce kowtows, winter."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Investigates Grain Transportation and Sales at Various Stations, Requiring Completion Within Half a Month from January to This Month</h3>
<p>Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, in order to investigate the grain transportation and sales at various railway stations, specially telegraphed the two Railway Administrations yesterday, stating: "To the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, the Ministry urgently needs to understand the transportation and sales of eight kinds of grain: wheat, soybeans, rice, polished rice, peanuts, millet, sorghum, and flour. The Administration should quickly instruct Nanjing Riverside, Zhenjiang Riverside, Danyang, Ben Niu, Changzhou, Qishuyan, Wuxi, Maigen Road, Shanghai North Station, Xinzhuang, Jiashan, Jiaxing, Xiashi, Gongchen Bridge, Hangzhou, Nanxing Bridge, Zhakou, Ningbo, Cao'e, and other stations to investigate and report the following information. Each station must report separately for each grain type and not mix them together: (A) If the station ships out the above-mentioned grain, it should investigate and report: (1) The total tonnage shipped out from January 1 to November 30 of this year. (2) The major stations to which the grain is shipped and the tonnage to each station. (3) The railway freight, loading and unloading fees, miscellaneous fees, and taxes per ton from the station to each destination station. (4) The current wholesale market price per dan (unit of weight) near the station and the equivalent price per metric ton. (5) The current amount of grain produced near the station that is stockpiled and available for export, approximately in tons. (6) To the extent possible, investigate the market price per dan near the major destination stations and the equivalent price per metric ton. (B) If the station ships in the above-mentioned grain, it should investigate and report: (1) The total tonnage shipped in from January 1 to November 30 of this year. (2) The major stations from which the grain is shipped and the tonnage from each station. (3) The railway freight, loading and unloading fees, miscellaneous fees, and taxes per ton from each origin station to the station. (4) The current wholesale market price per dan near the station and the equivalent price per metric ton. (C) If the station ships out and ships in the above-mentioned grain, it should investigate and report separately according to the items listed in (A) and (B). The above items should be reported by each station by telegraph to the Business Department of the Ministry, and must be completed within half a month after the Ministry's telegram arrives. The Administration should designate two to four people to supervise and assist each station to handle the matter seriously. It is requested that you comply accordingly."</p>
<h3>Excluding Various Surcharges</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations received instructions from the Ministry of Railways stating: "According to the case presented by the Joint Transportation Office, Case 59 of the 16th National Joint Transportation Conference on the calculation method of the joint transportation price regulations of each road should be standardized to avoid errors. It was decided that 'a circular should be issued to each road, stating that when calculating the responsible party, all surcharges should not be included to ensure uniformity and facilitate calculation.' It should be approved and implemented accordingly. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued for compliance." The Administration immediately ordered the Transportation Department to comply.</p>
<h3>Xiang Xiaomin Suggests Purchasing Government Bonds with Cotton and Wheat Loan Funds</h3>
<p>Xiang Xiaomin, an overseas Chinese from Nanyang, has been engaged in business in various ports in Nanyang and has a deep understanding of economics and finance. Recently, in view of the increasingly acute economic aggression of imperialism, he has returned to the motherland to work hard in industrial and commercial enterprises and has developed quite well. Now, in view of the low market price of domestic government bonds, he believes that it is detrimental to national prestige. Yesterday, he specially submitted a proposal to Chairman Lin of the National Government, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission, the Standing Committee Members of the Economic Commission, and Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, suggesting that the US cotton and wheat loan funds be invested in domestic government bonds and that the principal and interest repaid on the government bonds be used for construction. This would both maintain national credit and benefit construction, achieving two goals with one move. His vision is far-reaching. The original text is quite long, with thousands of words, roughly stating: "National planning should prioritize construction. Our government has repeatedly declared that cotton and wheat loan funds are entirely for construction projects and will absolutely not be used for military or political expenses. Recently, the Economic Commission has been officially established, and the funds obtained from the sale of US cotton have been deposited in various banks and have not been touched, which shows that the government is determined to pursue construction. However, it is better to use these funds to buy domestic government bonds than to deposit them in various banks. This will benefit both national construction and national credit. However, this may raise questions, thinking that the Economic Commission's purchase of government bonds with cotton and wheat loan funds will conflict with the government's declaration not to use them for other purposes. This statement seems correct but is not actually correct. Buying government bonds with cotton and wheat loan funds is an investment by the Economic Commission in the government, not a loan from the government to the Economic Commission. Moreover, the principal and interest of the government bonds have long been designated by the government and paid in installments without delay. This investment by the Economic Commission is actually safe and reliable. First, from the perspective of national construction: (1) The Economic Commission's purchase of government bonds with cotton and wheat loan funds can increase the interest rate on loan deposits. (2) The Economic Commission's purchase of government bonds with cotton and wheat loan funds can compensate for losses from the resale of cotton and wheat. (3) The Economic Commission's purchase of government bonds with cotton and wheat loan funds is equivalent to preserving cash. (4) The Economic Commission's purchase of government bonds with cotton and wheat loan funds allows the principal and interest on the government bonds to still be used for construction. (5) The Economic Commission's purchase of government bonds with cotton and wheat loan funds can protect the principal and interest of the loan. Second, from the perspective of national credit: (1) The Economic Commission's purchase of government bonds with cotton and wheat loan funds can stabilize and increase the market price of government bonds and prevent manipulation by speculators. (2) The Economic Commission's purchase of government bonds with cotton and wheat loan funds can increase investors' interest in domestic government bonds. (3) The Economic Commission's purchase of government bonds with cotton and wheat loan funds can consolidate the national financial position. (The original text has detailed explanations for each point, which are omitted due to length.) Finally, quoting a Reuters report published in Shanghai newspapers on the 24th of last month, 'Washington Deputy Treasury Secretary Morgenthau claimed that the Treasury Department is maintaining US government bonds that have recently fallen in price in the market and said that government agencies such as the Postal Savings Bureau, the Rural Lending Office, the Debt Repayment Reserve Fund, and the Central Deposit Insurance Office will hand over their funds to the Treasury Department for government investment,' which he believes can serve as a model for our country's government to follow."</p>
<h3>Ma Zuwu and Others Report on the Disaster Situation in Changyuan: The Flooded Area Accounts for More Than 90% of the County, with More Than 300,000 People Affected and Approximately 100,000 Still Starving</h3>
<p>The United Association of Shanghai Charitable Organizations for Emergency Relief for Yellow River Disasters received a telegram yesterday from Ma Zuwu and others in Changyuan, stating: "To the charitable organizations, we have already telegraphed the situation. After arriving in Changyuan County, we met with government officials and gentry and went to various districts to inspect the actual disaster situation, which is truly heartbreaking. Changyuan County, a third-class county, has always been poor and barren. In the remote countryside, there is a lack of people and resources. When the Yellow River overflowed, the people were struggling between life and death, but no one publicized it for them, and the cities did not know about it. After the floodwaters receded, the Red Swastika Society of the provincial government came to provide relief, but the disaster was too great and the funds were too small.</p>
<h3>Unable to Provide Universal Relief</h3>
<p>The first distribution gave each disaster victim seven copper coins, the second distribution gave each disaster victim seven spoonfuls of grain, and the third distribution gave each disaster victim two mao of silver, seven liang of flour, and seven and a half jiu of millet. Recently, the National Government's Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee sent personnel to investigate and distribute aid. It is said that the funds are relatively large, but the investigation has not yet been completed. A drop in the bucket, what good is it? What is even more strange is that in such a great disaster, there is not a single shelter or soup kitchen in the entire county. As a result, the strong have scattered in all directions, accounting for more than half. The former county magistrate was also dismissed for ineffective relief efforts, which shows the situation. It is found that Changyuan County has a total of seven districts, and the flooded area accounts for more than 90% of the county. There are more than 300,000 people affected.</p>
<h3>Breaches in the County Border</h3>
<p>There are thirty-one breaches. The people, livestock, and belongings in the five, two, three, and six districts adjacent to the breaches were swept away. Sand has buried the land by more than a zhang, and fertile fields have become stony fields. Even if the breaches are repaired, it will be difficult to cultivate the land next year. They have no clothes, no food, no shelter, and no hope of recovery. The suffering of the disaster victims in these four districts is the same, with nothing to distinguish them. There are still about 100,000 people starving. The current relief funds are limited. Even if other districts are not considered, if the funds are distributed equally, each person will receive only enough for one meal. If we choose the most needy, then</p>
<h3>A Group of Hungry Ghosts</h3>
<p>All are the most needy. What standard will be used to divide and choose them? They have the faces of pigeons and necks of swans, surrounding us all day long, crying and pleading. We really have no way to deal with it. We can only telegraph your office, hoping that you will continue to increase relief funds for the remaining people. We dare say that donating one more yuan</p>
<h3>Can Save One More Life</h3>
<p>Also. We also heard that the disaster situation in Dongming and Puyang is slightly less severe than in Changyuan, but the disaster victims who cannot guarantee their safety each day are also more than 70,000 or 80,000. We present this to you for your consideration and ask for instructions on how to proceed. Li Haichou arrived in Changyuan today. Ma Zuwu, Xie Zhisheng, Hong Jianfang, etc. kowtow."</p>
<h3>The Number of Imported Cosmetics Is Alarming: Exceeding One Million in the First Ten Months of This Year</h3>

<h3>Guo Shaoheng, River Captain of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang'an Ship, Commits Suicide on Board: Slits His Throat with a Knife in His Left Hand, Possible Cause of Suicide Due to Economic Reasons</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River line Jiang'an ship, which returned to Shanghai from Hankou on Saturday, was originally scheduled to sail this morning. However, yesterday, the ship's river captain, Guo Shaoheng, suddenly committed suicide, and the reason is unknown. There was no suicide note or other information. The details of this incident are as follows:</p>
<h3>Suicide Situation</h3>
<p>The Jiang'an ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is a first-class ship on the Yangtze River line and is scheduled to sail every Monday and Thursday. This time, it arrived in Shanghai from Hankou and entered the port on Saturday. The ship was berthed at the Jinliyuan Wharf. The river captain of the ship, Guo Shaoheng, was from Guangdong, 49 years old, and had been working on the ship for more than ten years. He had no faults. After the ship arrived, he had to go home (at Haiting Road and Tongchang Road) once, so he still lived on the ship on Sunday. He showed no signs of abnormality. At nine o'clock yesterday morning, the river captain was still not awake. His servant, Xi Jinlong, found it strange because Guo usually got up at seven o'clock. At about nine o'clock, the servant knocked on the door and called out, but there was no sound in the room. Xi Jinlong pushed the door open to wake him up, but as soon as the door opened, he saw the river captain lying in a pool of blood, already dead. Blood flowed all over the bed. The servant Xi Jinlong quickly reported to the shipowner. The shipowner and the servant went to check.</p>
<h3>Reporting to the Water Police</h3>
<p>The river captain's bedroom was behind the shipowner's bedroom. After hearing the shocking news, the servants rushed to watch and saw that Guo was lifeless, lying stiff on the bed. Because he was fat, blood flowed everywhere. The servants quickly reported to the shipowner, the chief mate, and the second river captain, Chen Ting'en, who went to inspect. At that time, the crew members decided to immediately hang the flag to summon the water police to come and decide on a plan. At 9:45, the water patrol arrived. After the crew members reported the suicide of the river captain, the water patrol reported to its team and went to the quarantine office to ask a doctor to come to the ship to examine the body of the deceased and the situation of his suicide. They also sent police to guard the ship.</p>
<h3>Medical Officer Examination</h3>
<p>At around 11 o'clock, the doctor from the quarantine office arrived and, together with the shipowner and the water police, went to the river captain's bedroom to examine the body. It was found that the deceased had used a very sharp foreign knife (exactly like a large kitchen knife) to slit his throat with his left hand. The cut was about an inch deep, from the ear to the throat. The blood vessels on the right side of the neck were completely severed, but the throat was not cut through. He died mainly from excessive blood loss. During the examination, the foreign knife was still placed between his chest and abdomen. His left hand was still bent, as if he were holding the knife to slit his throat. His right hand was hanging down. The deceased was wearing health clothes and trousers and was barefoot. There were no other injuries.</p>
<h3>Body Removed</h3>
<p>The doctor's examination concluded that it was undoubtedly a suicide. The body was sent to the South City Lifesaving Bureau after discussion by the water police and others. At that time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also received the report, and Zhao Yuntai, director of the shipping department, commissioned Qian Shuming to go to the ship to inspect and investigate the truth of the matter. At that time, Guo's body was first carried out of the bedroom, hoisted onto a small boat, and sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Bureau in South City, preparing to notify his family to prepare a coffin and collect the body.</p>
<h3>Checking the Belongings</h3>
<p>After this case occurred, the reason for Guo's suicide was unknown. He was usually cautious and dedicated to his work and showed no signs of mental illness. He was happy when he went home and returned to the ship this time. Why did he commit suicide? It became a question. At that time, the water patrol searched the bedroom and found only a letter addressed to Huang Fengqi (Huang was also working at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company). The letter stated that he had entrusted Huang to rent a house in Zhabei, but then suddenly refused to let him rent it. There was nothing else written. The letter was taken away by the water police. In the afternoon, the water police summoned Huang Fengqi to the bureau to question him and also summoned the servant Xi Jinlong to question him. Both said they did not know what happened.</p>
<h3>Appointing a River Captain</h3>
<p>Shipowner Chen was very saddened by Guo's suicide. Guo had been working for more than ten years and had never had an accident. In addition to reporting the matter to the head office, shipowner Chen also asked Director Zhao Yuntai to appoint someone to replace the river captain. In the afternoon, the company appointed the reserve river captain, Chen Tonghui, to replace him. According to shipowner Chen, Guo's suicide had no signs beforehand, and it was difficult to speculate on the reason. Guo had a wife and five children, with a monthly salary of 180 yuan, but there was not a penny left in his bedroom after his suicide. Perhaps he was disgusted with the world due to economic pressure. Shipowner Chen also said that Guo's death was like losing an arm, so he felt very sad after the accident and shed tears while speaking.</p>
<h3>Family Collects the Body</h3>
<p>Guo's family lived on Haiting Road. Yesterday, shipowner Chen collected Guo's salary from the company and sent someone to assist in the funeral because Guo's five children, the eldest being only 15 years old. The coffin will be temporarily placed in the Guangzhao Villa. On the one hand, it is planned to apply to the company for a pension according to the regulations to support the surviving family members.</p>
<h3>Mr. Sheng Jinsheng, an Old Worker at Our Newspaper, Passed Away Last Night</h3>
<p>Mr. Sheng Jinsheng, an old worker in the typesetting department of our newspaper, entered the newspaper during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. It has been more than 30 years now. He was usually thrifty, honest, and a model worker. Last year, he occasionally contracted madness, which came and went. Until last night, it suddenly worsened and he passed away at Renji Hospital. Mr. Sheng was 53 years old and died in poverty. His colleagues deeply mourned him.</p>
<h3>Fire in Huixiang Lane, Manufacturing Bureau Road</h3>
<p>Houses No. 8 and No. 9 in Huixiang Lane, behind the South City Manufacturing Bureau Road, were occupied by Yang Fengxiang, the local security guard (48 years old). At around 5:30 yesterday afternoon, while Yang himself was being examined by a Dr. Chen due to illness, a fire suddenly broke out under the ladder of the house. The fire spread rapidly, and the stairs were immediately burned. Yang and Dr. Chen panicked and jumped out of the window. Yang was fortunately unharmed, but Dr. Chen broke his left arm. Fire departments from various districts heard the alarm and rushed to the scene to put out the fire. After an hour and a half of watering, the fire was extinguished. On the one hand, the Second District General Office, which had jurisdiction over the area, ordered a large number of police officers to the scene to suppress the situation and immediately summoned Yang to the district for investigation. The injured Dr. Chen was taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Watchman Yan Ada Arrested for Extortion: Escorted to the Special District Court for Trial Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhongbin, who lived at No. 10 Datong Lane, Baek Road, made a living by dealing in gold and was relatively well-off. On the 28th of last month, he suddenly received an anonymous letter demanding 5,000 yuan. Zhang initially ignored it and did not reply. Until the 2nd of this month, he received another letter, which was more severe than before, saying that if the amount of 5,000 was not allowed, it would increase to 50,000, and there would be a risk to people's safety. He was also given a deadline of 1:00 AM on the 3rd to place the 5,000 yuan wrapped in oil paper at the iron gate of Datong Lane. Zhang ordered his accountant, Cheng Xiaojun, to report to the Xinzha Police Station. At the time, Detective Nei Chengke led detectives to the scene, placed the paper bag, and hid around to observe the situation. At about 1:30, Yan Ada, a Jiangbei watchman from the residence of Xi Lusheng, the landlord of No. 3, suddenly walked from his watchman's shed to the iron gate, looked around, and took the paper bag into his arms. Then, he closed the iron gate and slowly entered the shed. The detectives witnessed this situation. Just as they were about to arrest him, they suddenly saw the iron gate closed and were struggling to enter. At this time, a resident of the alley returned from outside and entered through a small door in the iron gate. The detectives followed him in and arrested Yan. The original paper bag was found in his arms and taken back to the police station. According to his confession, he colluded with a Mr. Ma. Yesterday morning, the witnesses were gathered and escorted to the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, explained the details of the case. However, the defendant, Yan Ada, stubbornly denied it. Although the handling detective performed the shape of his hand taking the paper bag and the procedure of searching the paper bag from his arms in court, Yan still denied it. Judge Wu then ordered Yan to write out some numbers to compare with the handwriting of the threatening letter received by Zhang Zhongbin. It was clear and he instructed the defendant to be held for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Thief Rong Pandao and Others Arrested for Attempted Robbery</h3>
<p>Jin Jiulin, inspector of the special law enforcement of the French Police, received a confidential report at dawn yesterday morning that a group of thieves were planning to rob a certain family's property at No. 9 Deren Lane, Lafayette Road, at 7:00 AM and would pass through the intersection of Lafayette Road and Pingjili Road. Inspector Jin, upon receiving the report, immediately summoned lead detectives Zhang Ziying and Qian Yumin, deputy detectives Zhou Bingcheng and Zhou Yaoting, detectives Cai Jinzhang and Liu Dianlong, and Xu Guilin to set off for the destination to lie in wait. At 6:30, three bandits were seen walking slowly with their hands in their pockets. When they arrived at the place, they stopped and peered around, whispering to each other. The detectives rushed forward and captured the two bandits in front. A loaded handgun with twelve bullets was found on one of them. The former confessed his name as Pandao De (32 years old, from Jiangbei) and the latter confessed his name as Yan Chunhua (34 years old, from Yangzhou). Just as the detectives were about to arrest the last bandit, the bandit saw that the situation was bad and ran east, turning from Lafayette Road into Jiale Road to the south, and opened fire to resist arrest. The detectives immediately returned fire and chased the bandit to Tangjiawan Road outside the Ximen Gate in the Chinese Concession. Nearby police officers who heard the alarm rushed to the scene, intercepted the bandit, seized his handgun, and took him to the Second District Public Security Bureau. The bandit confessed his name as Chen Zhixiang (28 years old, from Anhui). Inspector Jin and others first took the two bandits caught earlier back to the police station and reported to the detectives and the police chief. They then sent detectives to the Second District Public Security Bureau at noon to bring Chen back to the police station. The bandits confessed to committing robbery cases in the French Concession and were ordered to be detained, pending escort to the Second Special District Court for trial this morning.</p>
<h3>Zhu Baoyuan Inheritance Lawsuit Rescheduled for Hearing</h3>
<p>Zhu Baoyuan, the owner of Zhenhe Tea Shop, had a very humble upbringing. He started in his hometown of Haiyan, making a living by carrying a basket and hawking bean curd. Later, someone took him under their wing and brought him to Shanghai to seek employment, where he gradually prospered. Therefore, even though he had accumulated over 2.7 million in assets in his later years, he remained exceptionally frugal, with simple habits, rarely enjoying elaborate meals or wearing extravagant furs. However, his two sons, Zhu Shunqing and Zhu Yanqing, strived for lavishness, indulging in pleasures and prostitution, their nature being the complete opposite of their father's. This spring, after Baoyuan passed away, his entire estate fell into the hands of the Shunqing and Yanqing brothers. When their biological sisters, Zhu Jun, etc., legally requested their share of the inheritance, they initially ignored them. Only after being sued, fearing that the proportional distribution would incur significant expenses, did they seek mediation, offering each sister 80,000 yuan. Zhu Jun and her sisters, whose husbands' families were already well-off, decided not to dispute the matter further and reached a settlement. However, Zhu Xinxinbao, Baoyuan's stepmother, also made a claim for division of assets from the two sons after Baoyuan's death. Unfortunately, the Shunqing brothers only gave empty promises and paid lip service without any substance. By last month, she could no longer tolerate their procrastination and hired lawyer Chen Ying to file a petition with the First Special District Court.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case Previously Judged Sent Back for Retrial by Jiangsu Provincial Government; Second Special District Court Scheduled to Hear Case on the Afternoon of the 8th at 2:00 PM</h3>
<p>Kim Goolin, Inspector General of the Special Unit of the French Concession Police, and head detective Zhang Ziying, in July of this year, arrested in Tianjin notorious major bandits Geng Huatang, Zheng Tangsheng, Shang Zhen, Liu Yimin, Wu Shaoting, etc. for kidnapping five individuals in this city: Huang Yuyi, Vice President of the Zhongnan Bank; Chen Yanghe, Vice Manager of the Siming Bank; He Shaoting, owner of the Xin Senji Construction Company; Huang Baohua, a pigment merchant; and Ze Lin, son of Yunnan Division Commander Gu Zizhen. They were also involved in extorting ransoms in Tianjin for the kidnapping of Chen Zhuling and Liang Huiwu, compradors of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. They were brought to Shanghai and handed over to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. During the trial, Geng Huatang, fearing punishment, committed suicide by hanging himself with his silk shirt in the police detention center. Zheng, Shang, Liu, and Wu were found guilty of being repeat offenders assisting in kidnapping for ransom and were sentenced to death. The court reported the sentences to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for review. The four convicts, Zheng, et al., disagreed with the verdict and hired lawyer Zhu Dianqing, etc. to file a petition with the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting a retrial to overturn the conviction. The provincial government approved the request and sent the case back for a retrial. It has been reported previously that after receiving the case files, the Second Special District Court, with presiding judge Wang Gangxu, has issued summonses for the relevant parties and the detectives handling the case, as well as notifying the respective lawyers. The court is scheduled to hear the case on the afternoon of the 8th of this month at 2:00 PM. It is expected that the lawyers will engage in fierce debate at that time. This case is the first instance in which a death sentence handed down by the Second Special District Court in a theft case has been sent back by the provincial government for retrial.</p>
<p>The court clarified that, apart from the 160,000 yuan given to her two daughters, there were still 1,540,000 yuan remaining from her husband's estate. She requested an order for Zhu Shunqing and Yanqing to hand over the funds for division into four shares. The First Special District Court held a hearing to address the issue, first resolving the litigation costs. As for the division of assets, Judge Qiao Wanxuan also summoned both parties yesterday afternoon, originally intending to proceed with the hearing. However, the defendants' representative lawyer requested an adjournment, stating that a third party was now involved in mediation. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the case had been delayed for a long time and that the plaintiff was eager for a swift resolution. The defendant's request for a postponement due to ongoing mediation was not unreasonable, but they feared that it might lack sincerity and be a delaying tactic. If an adjournment were granted, it should be for a short period. Judge Qiao then ordered an adjournment until the afternoon of December 14th for the hearing.</p>
<h3>Ms. Cui Huisheng Discusses the Arrest of Kim Seok</h3>
<p>Kim Seok, a Korean patriot who had become a naturalized Chinese citizen, was arrested by the Japanese consulate in the French Concession. Over 360 citizens, including Zhang Yiqing, sent letters to various organizations requesting assistance. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has submitted a petition to the Municipal Government, requesting serious negotiations with the Japanese consulate. Details have been reported in various newspapers. The reporter, wishing to understand the details of the case, visited Ms. Cui Huisheng, Kim Seok's mother, at the Huisheng Hospital on Rue Massenet. She said that Kim Seok went out to visit a friend on the 22nd and never returned. Later, she heard from relatives and friends that he had been arrested and detained at the Japanese consulate. The next day, she went to the French Concession police to negotiate, stating that Kim Seok did not carry his citizenship certificate. However, citizenship certificates are issued per family, not per individual, so it is impossible to carry multiple copies at all times. The police were unreasonable. A few days ago, the Japanese consulate sent police, along with Western and Chinese police officers from the French Concession police, to search their home, but found nothing. After the incident, she went to the Municipal Government to request negotiations with the Japanese consulate, but received no concrete response. She also went to the Japanese consulate to inquire, but the consulate said that visits from elderly people were useless and that young people should come instead, likely intending to lure Korean youth. She said that they had already felt the pain of Korea's annexation and that now they had become naturalized Chinese citizens, but they still could not obtain effective protection under Chinese law, making them no different from doubly subjugated people. She could not help but weep. Ms. Cui expressed her gratitude for the righteous assistance of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and people from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Hired Hand Seduced Employer's Wife</h3>
<p>Fang Xiehe Sues Yang Hongyuan and Two Others</p>
<p>Fang Xiehe, a 29-year-old Ningbo native, runs a Xiehe Soy Sauce Shop at No. 95 Wujia Lane, Pudong. He married Fan, known as A Xiang, who is currently 25 years old and of average appearance. After their marriage, they had a son and a daughter, but the son passed away. In recent years, Fang also raised capital to open a small-scale cloth factory at No. 84, South Police Station Road, with three looms. He hired three weaving workers from Shaoxing: Shen Jiajin, Li Fusheng, and Yang Hongyuan. On average, each loom can produce slightly less than one bolt of cloth per day. Fang travels back and forth between the two businesses, working very hard. After finishing work each day, the three workers would gather at the soy sauce shop for leisure, gradually becoming familiar with Fang's wife. One of them, Shen Jiajin, harbored malicious intentions and seduced Fang's wife into adultery. Whenever Fang was away, they would secretly meet. Rumors spread, and Fang eventually discovered the affair. However, to save face, he dismissed Shen to sever their relationship. To his surprise, Fang's wife wept upon hearing that her lover had been dismissed. Fang knew the reason and feigned ignorance, asking why she was crying, but she did not answer. Fang hoped that the scandal could be extinguished. However, the next day, Fang's wife secretly took gold jewelry and cash and fled without a trace. When Fang discovered the theft, he found that over 300 yuan in cash and gold jewelry worth 200-300 yuan had been taken. She even abandoned their three-year-old daughter. By this point, Fang's working capital had also been taken, making it difficult to operate. He closed the shop and ceased operations. He later learned that his wife had indeed been seduced by the dismissed worker Shen Jiajin, with the help of the two remaining workers, Yang Hongyuan and Li Fusheng, and a neighbor named Hu Yiqing. He then arrested the three men and handed them over to the Third District police for interrogation by the court. He is also searching for the main culprit and his runaway wife, hoping to bring them to justice. Fang has suffered greatly from this ordeal, making him unable to operate either the soy sauce shop or the small cloth factory. Both businesses have been closed down, leaving him with nothing but misfortune.</p>

<p>At approximately 1:00 PM on the 30th of last month, Fei Renyuan, a manager at the Chang'an Lane, Ping'an Real Estate Agency in Yangshupu, was robbed of 318 yuan in rent money. He reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station. Head detective Yang Peisheng learned the day before yesterday that the bandits were hiding.

He presented the gun, ammunition, and stolen money as evidence, requesting an adjournment.

<h3>One Accuses of Gambling, One of Soliciting - Gigolo Seduces Young Girl</h3>
<p>The famous gigolo Dai Jilu (nicknamed "Little Lu"), claiming to be an assistant to a lawyer, specializes in seducing women and swindling them out of their money. He recently seduced Jia Lindi, an 18-year-old girl from Pudong whose late father, Jia Zhilin (who accumulated assets of over 100,000 yuan by operating a red pill business in Japan), lived in Yuanshang Lane, East Zilaihuo Street, in the French Concession. He rented a small house and lived with her. Dai's purpose was to seduce her and defraud her of her wealth, having heard that Lindi's father had left a large inheritance. Lindi, young and naive, was tricked out of several hundred yuan by Little Lu. Later, Little Lu instigated Lindi to steal her father's fox fur coat, which he wore in Japan, and pawn it for money. Not satisfied with this, he wanted Lindi to lure her mother to the small house to extort a large sum of money. Lindi rebuked him for his shamelessness, which led to a conflict. The next day, Little Lu went to the French Concession police to report that Jia Lindi's family was selling drug pills. While the police chief was investigating, Lindi also went to the police station to accuse Little Lu of seducing her and defrauding her of her money, and she directly accused Little Lu of being the accountant for Lu Laoqi, a notorious king of lotteries. Upon hearing this information, the police chief, with Lu Laoqi and his accomplices being vigorously pursued, detained Dai Little Lu to be sent to the court for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Ye Xiuming Severely Injured in Assault</h3>
<p>Ye Xiuming, a 34-year-old man from Songjiang, who worked as an accountant at the Xie Xinglong Gunny Sack Store in his hometown, came to Shanghai yesterday morning by car. He went to the Hesun Chang Gunny Sack Store at No. 37 Lao Yong'an Street in the French Concession to collect accounts. Because the store's old accountant demanded kickbacks, he got into a dispute and was beaten by several workers. He was kicked in the abdomen, resulting in serious injuries. Eventually, someone mediated and the matter was settled. However, at approximately 7:00 PM in the evening, Ye's injuries worsened. He was persuaded to report the incident to the Grande Route des Sapins Police Station. The police chief sent two Chinese detectives, No. 142 and No. 163, to arrest the perpetrators. To their surprise, Zhao Xingwei (a native of Ningbo), the store's accountant, dared to lead the workers in resisting arrest and tore the detectives' long robes. After a lengthy struggle, a passing patrol of Chinese and Western detectives helped to arrest Zhao Xingwei and two workers, who were detained at the police station to be sent to court for punishment. The injured Ye Xiuming was ordered to be rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that his injuries are too severe and he may be in danger of his life.</p>

<h3>Tianchan Stage Performs Play to Raise Funds for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Yellow River Disaster Relief Association and the Sichuan Southern Chongbao Qishui Disaster Relief Association believe that the flood this time has been the worst in history, with severe conditions, and it is unbearable to witness. Although the relief association and various charities are providing clothing, setting up factories, and distributing porridge, it is ultimately a drop in the bucket. Colleagues from the two associations, recognizing that the cold winter is approaching and the victims have nowhere to seek survival, had no choice but to continue providing widespread relief. At a recent meeting, they requested the Tianchan Stage to perform a play for two days to raise funds to help. The stage manager agreed. The association has now made the necessary preparations and has scheduled performances for tomorrow (Wednesday) and the day after (Thursday).

<h3>Limalu Road Improvement Project Begins – Municipal Public Works Bureau Builds Road Surface, Electric Company Lays Tracks</h3>
<p>Limalu Road in this city is one of the important roads in the South Shanghai District. For the purpose of revitalizing commercial activity and facilitating transportation, the Municipal Public Works Bureau announced a phased improvement plan as early as two years ago. The first phase of the improvement covered the area from Dongmen Road to the eastern section of Dama Tou Street. The demolition of buildings had been repeatedly delayed due to repeated requests from shops on both sides for extensions. As a result, road work was delayed. Currently, the drainage in this section has been completed, and most of the buildings blocking the road have been demolished or relocated. It is reported that the Public Works Bureau believes that the road work in this section is related to the Outer Malu Road's reconstruction of the streetcar track base and road surface. The delay in the Limalu Road project has prevented the Outer Malu Road reconstruction project from proceeding smoothly, which has affected traffic. Therefore, it has been decided that the construction of the road surface and sidewalks on Limalu Road will begin immediately, and the China Electric Company will lay streetcar tracks on the road at the same time.

<h3>Water Company Shuts Off Taiping Public Water Tap - Tenants of Bofu and Two Other Neighborhoods Panic</h3>
<p>The tenants of Bofuli, Boluli, Boshouli in Pingliang Road, Yangzhou Road, and Fuzhou Road, East Shanghai, including 209 houses and 10 tenements with overhanging structures, with 219 buildings and approximately 2,000 households, are concerned because the landlord, Deli Company, is unable to afford the metered water bills. Therefore, the water meters in these three neighborhoods were removed by the British-owned Shanghai Water Company. Under the panic of no water, the tenants insisted and the Taiping public water tap in the alleyways was turned back on. However, at 11:00 AM yesterday, the Taiping public water tap in the alley was also shut off by the company. The tenants reported to the Tenants Association, which immediately sent representatives to negotiate with the landlord, Deli Company, to turn the water back on. They waited for a response. Deli Company reported to the Shanghai Real Estate Association, which in turn reported to the Municipal Council. The Council instructed the tenant representatives to go to the bureau to explain the circumstances of the water shut-off, but the tenants did not want to go and continued to demand water from the landlord. At the same time, they turned on the Taiping public water tap on the road themselves. According to the Municipal Council, the Council's Board of Directors discussed this matter last Wednesday and believed that the company's proposal of 15% off 80%, (for example, if the rent is 1,000 yuan and the water bill is 200 yuan, 15% of 1,000 yuan is 150 yuan, so the full amount of 150 yuan would be collected. The extra 50 yuan would be discounted by 80%, which is 40 yuan, and the water bill would be paid for 160 yuan), was feasible. However, the landlords still believe that they are unable to afford this large amount of water fees, so if this matter is not resolved promptly, it is feared that an incident will occur.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bank Ximen Branch Opens - Municipal Education Association Also Moves Into Building Upstairs for Office</h3>

<h3>Charity Association Sends Letter to Local Association Requesting Donations for the Civilian Shelter</h3>
<p>The Charity Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Local Association requesting donations for the Civilian Shelter. The original text is as follows: "To whom it may concern, in recent years, all industries have been struggling, and life has become increasingly difficult. The poor and needy people are suffering from cold and hunger every winter and have no way to support themselves, which is visible everywhere. Our association has established a temporary shelter, which begins to accommodate people during the severe winter, providing them with food and clothing. When the weather warms up, those from other regions are sent back to their homes, the disabled are placed in various charities, and the strong and able-bodied are allowed to seek their own livelihood. This has been the case for many years. This year, the rural economy has collapsed, and all industries have been declining, so there are even more unemployed and homeless poor people. The number of people accommodated in the shelter reached more than 4,600 last year, and the situation will be even greater this year. The shelter's expenses have never been fixed, relying entirely on temporary fundraising. With no rice to cook, it is extremely difficult to cope. Considering that the situation of the shelter affects local public order, we hereby send a letter to your association, requesting your generous donation to help maintain it. We hope to receive a favorable reply. We are eagerly awaiting your response." It has been learned that the association has found three expanded locations: the Chaozhou Guild Hall at the South Railway Station, the Chao Hui Villa on Xietu Road, and the Great King Temple on Great King Temple Street. The directors and executives of these three places have been enthusiastic about providing relief and have allocated all of the space for use. As soon as the preparations are completed, accommodation will begin. However, fundraising this year is more difficult than in previous years. The association has planned to save on the expenses of staff and other expenditures as much as possible to avoid waste.</p>

Xu Songming, the acting president of Peiping University, Zhou Jianhou, the department head of the Agricultural College, and the deans of various colleges welcomed him at the station. After getting off the train, Liu made the following remarks to reporters: After arriving in Beijing, I originally intended to visit Minister Wang with Dean Wu (Xiangfeng) on the 15th, but unexpectedly fell ill and was bedridden for a week. After recovering, I visited Minister Wang a total of three times. I expressed to the Ministry of Education the difficult situation of Peiping University on behalf of the deans. The difficulty of Peiping University lies in the lack of financial solutions. The four colleges of agriculture, commerce, industry, and law are in a very difficult financial situation and cannot be maintained without additional funding. After the closure of the College of Fine Arts, the Ministry of Education did not approve the allocation of a portion of it for the use of Peiping University. Minister Wang promised to find a way in the new budget next year. Regarding the resignation of President Xu, he repeatedly urged him to stay. Before leaving Beijing, I (Liu, referring to himself) received a telegram from Peiping and also visited Minister Wang, who indicated that funding could be arranged when the Audit Department approves the new budget. Please convey this to President Xu and encourage him to overcome the difficulties and relieve the difficulties of the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education Orders and Promulgates Training Measures for Primary School Principals in Various Counties and Cities</h3>
<p>(Correspondence from Hangzhou) The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education believes that primary school principals should be leaders of the school and role models for society, responsible for comprehensively managing all school affairs, guiding teachers and staff in their respective duties, and promoting all educational extension activities. They have a significant impact on the quality of school management, the improvement of children's academic performance, the community's trust, and the promotion of local self-government. The qualifications of principals of public and private primary schools in various counties and cities in the province vary due to factual reasons. To improve the efficiency of primary schools, it is essential to enhance and train the administrative capacity of primary school principals in various regions. Therefore, the "Outline of Training Measures for Primary School Principals in Various Counties and Cities in Zhejiang Province" has been specially ordered and promulgated for all county and city governments to follow, and they are instructed to report the progress of implementation to the department for approval. The original outline of measures is recorded below:</p>
<p>Outline of Training Measures for Primary School Principals in Various Counties and Cities in Zhejiang Province: (Article 1) The training of primary school principals in various counties and cities shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this outline. (Article 2) The training of primary school principals aims to improve the actual administrative capacity of primary school principals and enhance their service spirit. (Article 3) The key training items for primary school principals are specified as follows: 1. Study and implement various educational laws and regulations and various government orders related to education. 2. Lecture on the most needed subjects in education recently. 3. Based on the results of supervision and inspection, point out common or specific shortcomings and indicate corrective actions and improvement methods. 4. Discuss how to closely connect with the community and the public and various practical issues in primary school education. (Article 4) The training of primary school principals shall be conducted on a regional basis in principle, named the Service Promotion Association of Primary School Principals of a certain county (city), which shall be presided over by a staff member dispatched by the Education Bureau.

<h3>The Course of the Chinese Painting Exhibition in Paris (4)</h3>
<p>Among the most precious ancient paintings are the "Drunken Revelry" and "Equestrian" paintings from the Tang Dynasty. The "Drunken Revelry" is likely the pinnacle of ancient Chinese painting. Choosing drunken revelry as the subject matter, the difficulty of its composition and expression surpasses that of landscapes, figures, flowers, or birds and animals. Achieving a successful work is truly not easy. Taking this piece apart to appreciate it reveals that the drunkards are depicted with their souls completely overturned and their actions frantic, evoking a sense of utter boredom in the viewer. Moreover, the observers, attendants, and those offering support are interspersed, each exhibiting their natural charm, and their expressions of alarm and pity are fully revealed. From a distance, it may seem indistinct, but upon closer inspection, the composition is well-organized and harmonious. The fineness of the brushwork and the excellence of the coloring can be fully appreciated even within the old, worn silk. The garments are entirely composed of lines, exhibiting both ancient simplicity and naturalness. The composition and expression of this work reach perfection in every aspect. It could not have been achieved without the genius of the art world. The "Equestrian" and his retinue, discovered by Paul Pelliot in Dunhuang, are also exquisite pieces in this exhibition. Pelliot considers this painting to be from the early Tang Dynasty (7th century), making it not only the only ancient painting in Chinese art history. Ancient Egypt and Greece have no surviving paintings. In the 7th century, Europe did not yet have such paintings. Only Chinese painting had already achieved a grand scale. The most important value of this painting lies largely in its historical antiquity. Although the coloring is not particularly remarkable, the composition and brushstrokes are quite admirable. The rider possesses the noble bearing of a great power's aristocracy and the elegant refinement of a hermit. The simple lines vividly depict the horse. It is indeed a rare piece from ancient China. It is a pity that we cannot ascertain who the rider was or who the artist was. Some believe that because it was discovered alongside Buddhist paintings, it is related to Buddhism, which is a misconception. The attire and demeanor of the rider and his retinue in this painting reflect the life of the Tang Dynasty, without a doubt. Although there are works from the Song Dynasty such as Su Dongpo's bamboo and Mi Fu's landscapes, many are likely inaccurate. Only the anonymous "Cattle" and "Hermit" paintings are relatively commendable. The composition of the "Cattle" painting is particularly ingenious, using only one line to form a hillside, with no other scenery. A bull descends from the mountain, while a cow stands at the foot of the mountain, nursing her calf, intending to ascend but unable to. Within a small space, the artist manages to express the intimate meaning of kinship and empathy. Beyond realism, it also incorporates deep natural emotions. The bull's descending posture and the cow's gazing expression are particularly refined, with a mutual attraction that is beyond description. The brushwork is simple yet profound, and the accuracy in depicting the scenery fulfills the artist's duty. Moreover, the ability to express the tender emotions is even more wonderful. The "Hermit" painting is uncolored, composed only of lines. Its painting style and composition are quite unique, making it seem unsuitable as a Song Dynasty work. Since the Later Tang Dynasty, Chinese painting had a concrete foundation, and would not have been so simple. This painting contains boundless poetic meaning, depicting a scholar in the forest, leaning against a tree, with short hair and a long beard, a dignified and moral appearance. The garments are composed of curved lines, conveying an ancient natural flavor. Two deer are depicted approaching, bearing flowers as gifts. This is a work of deep emotion and skillful craftsmanship, which is also a major flaw in Chinese painting. The artist often strives to seek inner life but neglects the technique of expression. The Yuan Dynasty has a "Two Horses" painting by Zhao Mengfu, a genuine work by Zhao and incomparable to other forgeries. Zhao is renowned for his refined elegance. These two horses, one white and one blue, have a simple and harmonious composition. The white one is in the front, lowering its head to the ground, as if searching for something. The blue one stands beside it, its body delicate and exceptionally docile. The colors are rich and the fur is fine and soft, appearing lifelike and inviting a touch. The black and white lines on the back are particularly pleasing to the eye, Zhao's unique skill. In terms of realism, it is exceptionally accurate and vivid. In terms of painting style, Zhao's works are the crystallization of China's long-standing culture. His horse paintings are not only the genius of Chinese art, but also rank among the best in the world art scene. The Jurchens entered and ruled Central China, deeply influenced by Chinese culture. Zhao's horses are an example of this. It is a pity that such rare authentic works have fallen into the hands of foreigners, which is truly regrettable. There is also a "Hunting Scene" that is quite commendable, but it is not credible that the French claim it to be by Zhao. There is also a "Birds in Snow" painting, very similar to the works of Yi Yuanji of the Song Dynasty, but foreigners claim it to be by a Ming artist, likely due to its relatively bright colors. Although there are more than twenty Ming Dynasty works on display, many are forgeries, making it difficult to distinguish. Among the more reliable ones is Lü Ji's "Two Geese." The geese have white bodies with black markings, and the lines are incredibly fine, delicate, and even. One is depicted in a resting posture, the other in a calling posture, with ripples of water and accompanied by rocks and hibiscus, serene, pure, and immaculate. The composition captures the simplicity of ancient masters, and the brushwork is extremely steady and meticulous. The artist is undoubtedly a renowned figure with a familial tradition and keen sensibility. Such a work could not have been produced without decades of diligent study. There is also an anonymous portrait of a monk, which, along with the Tang Dynasty's "Drunken Revelry," are precious masterpieces in the exhibition. This portrait is likely a work from the Yuan Dynasty or early Ming Dynasty. The lines of the head are extremely refined, natural, and evenly curved, fully revealing an otherworldly, detached-from-worldly-affairs expression. The demeanor is calm and composed, but the lips seem to contain a restrained bitterness, an unspoken sentiment, giving a sense of solemnity and rich emotions. It is unknown how such valuable works have all fallen into the hands of foreigners. Among the works of the Qing Dynasty, Ren Bonian's "Nine Elders" is magnificent without losing its refinement, surpassing the common and completely shedding traditional malpractices and hypocritical trends. He is truly worthy of being a master who ushered in a new era in Chinese art. Other works such as Shen Nanpin's deer, Qian Zai's bamboo, Ji Gu's landscapes, and Xu Dazhang's portraits are all rare and exceptional pieces. As for the works of modern artists, such as Qi Baishi, Xu Beihong, Chen Shuren, Jing Hengyi, Zhang Daqian, Ling Zhizhi, Fang Yaoyu, Gao Qifeng, Wang Yiting, Zheng Manqing, Lü Fengzi, Wang Yachen, Zhang Yuguang, Zhang Shuqi, Huang Baohong, Lin Fengmian, Pan Tianshou, Gao Qifeng, and He Tianjian, are all valued by Europeans, and French newspapers have given them much critical acclaim, which will not be repeated here.</p>

<h3>Universities in East China are Actively Preparing for Debate Competition Representatives' Meeting will be Held on the 9th of this Month to Discuss the Progress of Association Affairs</h3>
<p>After the East China University Students' Speech and Debate Association was established last semester, Jinan University was responsible for organizing a Mandarin speech competition. According to the association's regulations, each school takes turns to be responsible for organizing each semester. This semester, Nanjing Central University should be responsible for organizing two competitions: Mandarin debate and English speech. However, more than two months have passed since the start of the semester, and Central University has only issued a notice soliciting debate topics at the beginning of the semester, with no other news. The schools have repeatedly inquired, but there has been no response. Upon investigation, it was learned that Central University had not yet produced a student union this semester, and there was no one in charge. Therefore, the Mandarin debate competition originally scheduled for November could not be realized. Recently, the Shanghai University Federation organized a Mandarin speech competition for Shanghai universities and held a preliminary round at the Sichuan Road YMCA. Representatives from various schools attended the meeting and inquired about the preparations for the East China University Debate Association. They learned that Central University was unable to proceed due to a lack of responsible personnel. The representatives believed that the competition should not be completely suspended due to the local situation of Central University. Therefore, representatives from Jiaotong University (Gong Shaoxiong), Hujiang University (Zhu Faqin), Fudan University (Wu Zhenchao), Guanghua University (Secretary Zhu), and Jinan University (Zhou Xinmin) held an informal discussion. However, because the representatives from Guanghua and Jinan University were responsible personnel from the school authorities, they could not speak as student representatives. Therefore, the representatives from Jiaotong University, Hujiang University, and Fudan University (all member schools of East China) jointly decided to issue a notice convening representatives from all member schools in East China. A tea party will be held at the Central Society on Weihaiwei Road at 5:00 PM on the 9th of this month to further decide on the progress of association affairs.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau's Qualification Examination Will Be Postponed to Next Spring</h3>

It has been learned that the bureau has decided to postpone the examination to next spring break due to the large number of applicants from various schools, which exceeds 600, and the lengthy and time-consuming review procedures. A notice will be issued when the date is determined.</p>
<h3>Graduates of the Two Railway Schools Started Their Internships Yesterday Period of Half a Month Daily Work Assignments</h3>

<h3>Shangwen Primary School Anniversary Commemoration</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Shangwen Primary School has been established for fourteen years, and the number of students has been increasing year by year, now reaching more than 900. The school's rented premises on Shangwen Road are too narrow and unsuitable. Therefore, funds have been raised to build a new school building on the original site of the First Public School.

<h3>Yěshì Wins Over Nánxīng As Well</h3>
<p>Nánxīng's team was incomplete and their formation was somewhat disorganized. Yěshì also didn't start well. Neither side was accurate with their shots. In the first half, the score was 21 to 20, with Yěshì winning. After the break, Yěshì became much more active. Zhèng Zhìfāng had accurate aim and repeatedly made shots, gaining great momentum. Their defense in the back was also strengthened. Nánxīng's formation was scattered and their shots lacked accuracy. Later, Zhèng Zhìfāng of Yěshì was fouled out twice, and Nánxīng gained momentum for a while, surpassing them. However, Yěshì regained the lead with several long-range shots. In the end, Yěshì won over Nánxīng with a score of 44 to 40.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Yōngzǐ</p>
<p>Even the best peony needs green leaves to support it. — To put it in modern terms, it's "cooperation." Human eating and drinking is also like this. From the chicken's mouth all the way to the ox's rear end, passing through the five viscera and six bowels, you digest me and I transform you. Only then can the weather be favorable and the body be healthy and the mind at peace. If some part refuses to cooperate, then either there's constipation or a flow of white or yellow discharge. It's unavoidable.</p>
<p>Extending this to the family, "cooperation" is also essential. If the husband complains that the wife stays home all day and doesn't go out to work, and in a fit of pique, quits his business, they will surely face famine and starve to death. If the wife complains that the husband works outside and pushes all the cooking, tea-making, and child-rearing onto her, and in a fit of pique, refuses to do anything, then the family will surely be destroyed.</p>
<p>The existence of a nation is also like this. The existence of the central government depends on the support of the local governments. And the existence of the local governments depends on the maintenance of the central government. The mutual relationship of their organization is like a train and its locomotive. A train, without a locomotive, just sits on the tracks, useless. A locomotive, without passenger or freight cars, just runs around by itself, seemingly without much meaning. A central government without local governments is naturally a bare locomotive, and local governments without a central government are like trains without locomotives, no different.</p>
<p>The League of Nations' inability to restrain violence and uphold justice is also due to its inability to obtain the cooperation of its member states. "Coexistence and co-prosperity" may be a tired old tune, but looking at the old tune itself, it is indeed a profound and true saying. And even more so for fellow passengers navigating stormy seas, they should strive to cooperate under the concept of "coexistence and co-prosperity." Otherwise, they will surely all fall into the sea and perish together.</p>
<h3>One-Sided Life</h3>
<p>— Chú Hóngxiá</p>
<p>For the sake of livelihood, I have to run back and forth seven or eight li every morning and evening on a long canal embankment. The trees, flowers, and grass along the bank, and the people in the thatched huts, whether men, women, old, or young, have become familiar faces over the past six months.</p>
<p>Recently, the north wind has been blowing hard for several days. After all, Jiangbei is not as mild as Jiangnan, and the climate has suddenly changed. The wind stings the skin like a sharp knife, and the sunlight has become dim and powerless. In the mornings and evenings, I walk alone on this embankment swept by yellow sand.</p>
<p>Since the day before yesterday, I have discovered many new friends along the embankment. They are like swallows, migrating according to the seasons, arriving every year in the harsh north wind, bringing their children with them. Their hometown is far away in Shandong Province. Their houses are very simple. A wheelbarrow can carry all their belongings, even their houses are on it. When they reach the long embankment, they choose a sunny spot. A rectangular reed mat, about eight feet long and five feet wide, is rolled into a semicircle and nailed to the ground with branches. This is their dwelling. The whole family lives inside, with the hall, living room, bedroom, kitchen... all mixed into one. The door of the house is only big enough for a two-year-old child to pass through. Older children have to bend over to enter and exit, and adults must crawl.</p>
<p>Their occupation is making clay figures, small whistles... toys for children. The women and children make a living by begging. Their clothes are so tattered that one might suspect they are not made of whole pieces of cloth, but of ropes tied together. Their food consists of sweet potatoes, turnips... coarse grains. Alas, them...</p>
<p>Since their arrival, every day I walk on this long canal embankment swept by yellow sand, I forget that I am walking in the human world. It feels as if I am walking in hell.</p>
<h3>The Bean Grinder</h3>
<p>— Gōng Yí</p>
<p>The sky is gray, with no moon or stars, only a weak light shining from a broken doorway.</p>
<p>An old man sits alone by the millstone, grinding soybeans with a creaking sound.</p>
<p>The old man's forehead is covered in beads of sweat that drip down, just like the soybean milk that spurts out of the millstone.</p>
<p>The snores coming from everywhere respond to the old man's heavy breathing, as if they are composing two different pieces of music.</p>
<p>The sky is gray, with no moon or stars, only a weak light shining from a broken doorway.</p>
<h3>Talking About Fountain Pens</h3>
<p>— Huànrán</p>
<p>Hasn't the fountain pen already become an essential accessory for people's attire these days?</p>
<p>If you take a tram in Shanghai and settle down, you'll see fountain pens of all colors everywhere you look. If you have one on your person, you have to be careful of thieves trying to steal it.</p>
<p>When modern misses and misters meet and fall in love at first sight, they often run to the stationery department of ×× Company to buy the most gorgeous fountain pen, worth dozens of yuan, produced by a famous foreign manufacturer, as a meeting gift to please their beloved. Because it is a product of a famous foreign manufacturer, plus shipping costs, tariffs, and store expenses, it has such an expensive price. Using this expensive price is enough to show their respect and obtain their true love.</p>
<p>Friends who have traveled far across the ocean and returned to their motherland, wearing golden attire, of course have fountain pens hanging in their suit pockets that they personally selected from famous manufacturers in the countries they lived in. Even those academics who have never left the country but have aristocratic airs, as well as the trendy guys who work in government agencies or foreign companies, who isn't using genuine foreign goods? If you ask them, they will immediately reply without hesitation, either saying that foreign goods are durable or that they are old things bought five years ago.</p>
<p>As for the inexpensive and beautiful domestic product, the Guan Le Ming fountain pen, it is mostly found on the clothes of people in middle and elementary schools. Is this truly driven by a patriotic heart, or is it related to their level of economic affluence?</p>
<h3>Laughter</h3>
<p>— Qīfènglóu Zhǔ</p>
<p>Observing the current state of society and the nation, there is only reason to cry, where can laughter be found? But then again, crying doesn't help the situation. It's better to cheer up, turn tears into smiles, and devise plans to save the situation. That's the best course of action. However, national affairs are beyond our advice as ordinary people, and we have no right to advise them. So, let me talk about various kinds of laughter in ordinary society. A three- or four-year-old child, in the arms of a loving mother, feels uncomfortable or unhappy. They open their little mouth and cry incessantly. At this time, if you put a fragrant and sweet candy into their little mouth, they will soon stop crying and show a smile. This smile is innocent, the most natural and purest smile.</p>
<p>A rickshaw puller, gasping for breath, pulls his passenger to their destination. He slowly stops the rickshaw, constantly pulling at his uniform and wiping the sweat from his brow. He waits patiently, standing aside, for the reward for his hard work - the fare. He then begs pleadingly, "Sir, please give me a few more coppers." At this time, he puts on a smile on his sallow face. This is a pitiful and unnatural smile.</p>
<p>When a man and a woman go from initial friendship to the path of love, this period is naturally the key to blossoming love and bearing fruit. Therefore, all actions must be careful and gifts must be given to help nurture the seeds of love. What is most thought-provoking is when they sit side by side in the secluded depths of green shade. He gently slips a diamond ring onto her delicate hand. A faint blush appears on her rosy cheeks, revealing a faint smile. Shouldn't this be a sweet and beautiful smile?</p>
<p>As for the smiles bought by the gold of courtesans in brothels, the smiles of subordinates towards their superiors, the smiles of shop assistants towards their managers, as well as the wild laughter of drunks, the foolish laughter of madmen, etc., these are all hypocritical, forced, and stimulated smiles that have long lost the true meaning of laughter.</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Platoon Leader</h3>
<p>— Zhāng Hènshuǐ</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Desiring to Leave and Yet Unwilling, Remembering Past Events on the Same Train; Half Crying, Half Laughing, Leaning on the Pillow in Sickly Autumn</p>
<p>I remember this time last year, when I had known Ji Zhi for more than half a year and we had developed feelings for each other. I had accepted his invitation to secretly see the red leaves in Fragrant Hills. Now the red leaves have reappeared, but those past events are impossible to imagine again. There are a dozen pots of chrysanthemums in the courtyard. After a rainstorm a few days ago, the yellow chrysanthemums have turned ochre, the pink chrysanthemums have turned pale white, and the red chrysanthemums have turned charred gray. Standing by the eaves, I stared blankly at these chrysanthemums, feeling that their withered colors, with the petals turned back and the flower heart sticking out, seemed to be telling people that there were not many days left in this world. Jiang Shi was coming over from Zhao Weng's side with a stack of banknotes, raising them up from afar for Gui Zhi to see, saying: This is thirty yuan given by your old master, you can have it, you can buy some more clothes. Gui Zhi frowned, wanting to say something unpleasant to her mother, but suddenly remembered that her mother was talking about Zhao's affairs. If she said something unpleasant while taking the money, her mother would become suspicious. So suddenly her brows relaxed, and she smiled and said: Thank you old master, if you give us thirty or forty yuan each time like this, by this time next year, we will have two boxes of clothes to make. Jiang Shi said: I want to rely on that until this time next year, but people also have to be willing. Seeing her mother looking so happy, how could Gui Zhi spoil her mood, so she smiled slightly at her. Jiang Shi went into the room to collect the money, and Gui Zhi was still wandering in the courtyard. It was just that some cirrus clouds were rising in the sky, heavily obscuring the sunlight. The sky was gloomy, swaying in the pots, definitely not the scene of pomegranate flowers in summer. (Note: In the old capital, eight or nine out of ten families must have potted plants in their yards, regardless of wealth. The price of flowers is also cheap. If you graft chrysanthemum roots, you can buy thirty or forty pots for one yuan.) (259)</p>

<h3>A Record of the Cambridge Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Xīshén</p>
<p>My friends Biàn Xuè'ān, Huáng Gōng'ān, and Chén Gānyí formed the Cambridge Painting and Calligraphy Society in West Shanghai. Cambridge is where Xuè'ān lives. I often visit his Rěngǔ Building to view his paintings. Xuè'ān returned from traveling to Mount Hua and created a scroll over three zhang long, from Luoyang to Huayin, including everything he saw along the way. He completed it in three days, similar to Wu Daozi painting the Jialing River map, without relying on a draft, remembering everything in his heart, achieving the wonder of a quick hand and sharp eye. Mount Hua is towering and majestic, and in the past, no one made long scrolls of it. Xuè'ān also has a twelve-inch album, dividing the scenery from Xigu upwards to the three peaks. Luoyang Longmen is the path of the Yi River entering the Yellow River, with Shique and Xiangshan facing each other. Since the Northern Wei Dynasty, over 100,000 Buddhist statues have been carved. Xuè'ān changed his draft four times. The first three versions have already been bought away by art lovers. The one remaining in the building is the fourth version. It is rare for modern people to be able to paint Northern School landscapes. It's not that painters don't travel north, but Xuè'ān is the most skilled at painting them realistically. Xuè'ān's family lives in Qingdao. Every year on the hottest days of summer, he returns to escape the heat. This year, after returning from Qingdao, he showed me the Lao Peak Map. Lao Mountain has rarely been the subject of poems by scholars since ancient times, and even fewer painters depict it. Gōng'ān painted the coastal mountain scenery, capturing the essence of the rising sun over the sea and sky. The painting styles of the two gentlemen are similar to those of masters before the Ming Dynasty, coming from their natural talent. Their paintings far exceed the scope of the Four Wangs, Wu Yun, and do not bind them to the trends of an era. They are spiritually and remarkably surpassing the ancients, with unique creative power, not inherited from paper and silk. Western painting has come to the East, and oil painting and watercolor techniques have been adopted by painters. However, Western painting emphasizes realism, and the size and proportions must not deviate in the slightest. The area painted is only what the camera lens captures. And the famous photographers take the light and shadow, pay great attention to nature. Today's students of Western painting do not understand the wonder of nature, which is both in the size and proportions and outside of it. It cannot be obtained by using dead methods. Therefore, the point reached by photographic art cannot be reached by Western painters. As a result, famous European and American painters are eager to study Eastern painting techniques in order to change their methods. Our country's painting techniques have an unyielding spirit and an unworldly charm, using brush and ink to represent a thousand miles in a short space. Although they are not proportionally accurate, viewers feel as if they are wandering in the picture. The so-called painting within a painting, and painting in empty spaces, are all wonderful traces, exceeding the point of nature reached by the camera lens. However, modern painters focus too much on freehand drawing, deviating too far from realistic representation, which is also too extreme. Therefore, traditional Chinese painting should also adopt the strengths of Western methods, emphasizing proportions. I believe that the painting methods of the two gentlemen deeply understand this intention. The paintings of figures in the Six Dynasties gained inspiration from the Buddhist paintings of the Western Regions and changed them. However, this is not something that mediocre hands can do. Now that Western painting has come to the East, how should we adopt its strengths, merging realism and freehand drawing into one, opening up a new record in the art world? I have high hopes for the two gentlemen. Previously, the Cambridge Painting and Calligraphy Society held an exhibition at the Lake Society. I took time out of my busy schedule to visit. Unfortunately, Xuè'ān's paintings of Mount Hua and Longmen were not displayed. However, Xuè'ān's Canglong Ridge, Tianmu Cloud Sea, Huawu, Baiyun Heap, Qingyuan Gorge in Guangdong, and Dengwei Tiger Mountain Bridge, as well as Gōng'ān's Yulin Mouth of Lao Mountain, Willow Tree Terrace, Daming Lake in Jinan, and the Lao Mountain Hualou Peak painted by both gentlemen, were all on the wall. The next day, I talked about it with a friend who was going to visit, but unexpectedly, it closed the night before. They all regretted not being able to see it. Inquiring of the two gentlemen, I learned that most of it had been bought by others. Xu Jun Shaozhou, also a Cambridge painting friend, recently accepted an invitation to Hunan University and is not in Shanghai. His Jingxi Shanjuan Cave map also realistically depicts the scenery. Chen Jun Ganyi is a former professor at Zhengfeng College of Arts and Sciences. His seal script, official script, regular script, and running script screens and couplets are complete in spirit and kingly in aura. His ancestors were famous for their calligraphy, with Mr. Yufang Zihe and others. He is deeply rooted in family learning, so his foundation is particularly strong and his talent is overflowing, which is not easily achieved by ordinary people.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>I Also Speak</h3>
<p>— What About Li Houzhu?</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw an article about Li Houzhu in "Free Talk." Now, I will offer some criticisms of Li Houzhu.</p>
<p>Li Houzhu, this "Song Emperor," has been praised to the highest heavens by those who study poetry for the past twenty years. In reality, he is not worthy of such flattery. If he had not been born in the Five Dynasties, if he had not been an emperor, if he had not established a nation in Jiangnan, if he had not met a tragic end as a vanquished ruler, and if poetry had not been a newly emerging aristocratic literature at that time, perfectly suited to his life, he would not have been able to create such lyrics. However, I do not deny that the author's innate heredity also played a considerable role.</p>
<p>What kind of thing was poetry in the Five Dynasties? As long as we have read "Among the Flowers" and read Ou Yangjiong's preface to "Among the Flowers," we will know that poetry and the Yuefu poetry of the Southern Dynasties, and palace-style poetry are all things of the same nature, all adapting to the demands of the ruling class, the aristocracy, the bureaucracy, and the intellectuals in their lives, and expressing their attitudes. In society, they relied on their superior status, special rights, and enjoyed all possible happiness in the world: fine wine, women, and singing. Harmonious and delightful enjoyment of these three was precisely what their ruling class demanded. Poetry, this thing, came precisely from the hands of their class, as evidenced by the authors of "Among the Flowers." It took precisely their life of fine wine, women, and singing as its content, and was sung and played in palaces and brothels, in luxurious banquets and embroidered tents, satisfying the demands of their class's life, as evidenced by the works in "Among the Flowers." They were so greedy for momentary pleasure, carrying an extremely strong sense of sentimentality or decadence, which was inevitable for their class, living in the Five Dynasties, in such a state of sudden rise and fall, and unpredictable disasters.</p>
<p>Lu You's postscript to "Among the Flowers" says: "At that time, the world was in danger, and the literati were so dissolute, perhaps out of boredom." He said it was out of boredom, which is not entirely wrong. However, at this time, it was not only the literati who were dissolute and bored, but the monarchs were also the same. It can be said that it included the entire ruling class. Li Houzhu was one of these dissolute and bored monarchs. From Emperor Zhaozong of Tang, Emperor Zhuangzong of Later Tang, to Wang Yan of Former Shu, and Meng Chang of Later Shu, were they not all monarchs who indulged in singing and dancing, and immersed themselves in sensual pleasures? How could they not write poetry? It was not just the Middle Lord and Later Lord of Southern Tang alone! In short, we must remember that the ruling class, monarchs, and officials in the Five Dynasties mostly lived a life of fine wine, women, and singing, a life of delightful revelry. Only in this way can we discuss the poetry of Li Houzhu of Southern Tang.</p>
<p>Where does the goodness of Houzhu's poetry lie? It is only because poetry was originally a song for the ruling class, monarchs, officials, and leisurely intellectuals to seek pleasure. After Li Houzhu became a vanquished ruler, his poetry became a new form of poetry expressing indignation and lamentation. Several of his poems were able to evoke sympathetic resonance from readers, so he became a remarkable poet.</p>
<h3>A Record of Stillness at Fangyan (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>The mountains near Fangyan are all steep cliffs, two or three hundred feet high, with an area of three to five or six to seven li in circumference. The area of the peaks and the feet of the mountains does not differ much, and their shapes are either upwards or round, resembling huge pillars supporting the sky. The tops of the peaks and rocks are all flat ground, with dense forests, growing like hair. The waists of the peaks are just layers of sandstone cliffs, visible but inaccessible. Occasionally, waterfalls rush down, and strange trees emerge. From morning to dusk, due to the shifting of sunlight, wind, and rain, the shapes and scenery also change thousands of times, making it difficult to grasp. The magnificent view of the mountains can be said to have reached its peak here, right?</p>
<p>In the past, when I looked at the strange rocks and steep cliffs in Chinese paintings, the wrinkles were layered and powerful, to an unbelievable extent. Now that I have arrived at Fangyan, and glance at the mountains, I realize that the mountain sketching of both the Southern and Northern schools still has its shortcomings. When I first learned English in school, I read "The Great Stone Face," a short story by the American Puritan writer Hawthorne, and I had strange ideas. When I came to Fangyan, I realized that I was young and ignorant. Like the Great Stone Face written in that novel, there are so many of them in this vicinity that I don't know how many there are. I have never been to Egypt, so I don't know whether the Sphinx in the desert is more or less impressive than these rock faces. Especially the area that is naturally created, quiet and lonely to the point of making one's hair stand on end, is the location of the Five Peaks Academy under Shoushan, about two or three li north of Fangyan.</p>
<p>Several peaks in the north, encircling from near and far, and to the west and south, form a thousand-foot-high cliff, forming an inverted dangerous wall that protrudes upwards and shrinks downwards. Under the waist of the dangerous wall, about two or three feet from the ground, the foot of the wall suddenly disappears, forming a large cave, like the open mouth of a giant monster. The upper and lower parts of the mouth are stone walls. The Five Peaks Academy, Lize Shrine, and Xueyi Studio are built between the upper and lower jaws of this giant mouth, without the use of rafters and tiles, yet they are protected from wind and rain.</p>
<p>It is warm in winter and cool in summer, and the mundane world does not reach it. What is even more strange and precipitous is that this cliff suddenly folds to the southeast, and the five strange peaks of Guhou, Waterfall, Peach Blossom, Fufu, and Jiming rise up in succession. Each peak is as tall as Fangyan, but the shapes and colors are different. Standing on the upper floor of the Five Peaks Academy, one can only hear the clear sound of waterfalls all around. Looking up, the sky is small, and birds cannot fly over it. Looking at the Five Peaks, they are blue and purple and silent. Looking east, one can vaguely see white clouds and distant trees, floating in the wedge-shaped open space in the air. A sense of serenity, freshness, and greatness naturally assails one; Zhu Xi, Lü Donglai, and Chen Longchuan, the Confucian scholars, must have chosen this place to lecture, and the general Song Confucians liked to use mountain caves or places with beautiful scenery as lecture halls. 推其本意，大約總也在想借了自然的威力來壓制人慾的緣故：不看金華的山水，這種宋儒的苦心是猜不出來的。</p>
<p>When I first arrived at Fangyan, I spent the whole day in the drizzle touring the surroundings of the Five Peaks Academy and the entire Hugong Temple. The temple is on the top of the rock, and its scale is quite large. There are also two streets and many houses in front and behind. Under the blessing of Meng Hugong; one person becomes a Buddha, and even the chickens and dogs become immortals, which is a common practice in China. The statue of Hugong is a gentle old man with a red face and a long beard. There is one in each of the front and back halls, and their appearance and decoration are the same. Presumably, one is prepared for use during outings. On the day we went to pay our respects to Hugong, it happened to be the first day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar. A village opera was being performed on the stage in the front hall of the temple to worship the gods. Many old and young men and women were crowded in front of the stage, each shedding some tears of joy from being moved. However, we did not understand the plot or words of the opera at all. When we asked a middle-aged gentleman standing beside us who seemed to be a local and could speak Mandarin, we learned that the opera troupe was a local troupe and that the opera being performed was a miscellaneous drama of filial piety and righteousness, such as "Killing the Dog to Advise the Wife."</p>
<p>After descending from Hugong Temple and returning to the Cheng ×× shop where we were staying, two large red candles had already been lit in the lobby, and many dishes of large pieces of meat and chicken had been placed, waiting for us to eat. The vegetables were extremely abundant, but there was little fish and seafood, so the taste was not very good either.</p>
<p>The next day, I got up at dawn and still took the original sedan chair to return to Yongkang via Fushan Temple in Lingyan. The scenery along the way was also clear and different.</p>
<p>First, Lingyan is also a strange peak that rises up like Fangyan. In the middle of the peak, there is a large penetrating cave, about two or thirty feet long and five or six feet wide. The so-called Fushan Temple is built in this large cave. We climbed the mountain from the east end, entered the back of the cave, passed through a long alley separated from the cave, exited the south opening of the cave, and arrived at the temple. There were also Heavenly King Hall, Weituo Hall, Great Hero Hall, Guanyin Hall, and other facilities. The size of the mountain cave can be imagined. The four mountains surround the south, and the red leaves and green branches shine so lovely. Because the sky was clear, the air was clear and fresh. Looking down from above, the winding stone steps leading down the mountain felt even more secluded and bottomless.</p>
<p>After descending Lingyan, we took a detour to the northwest to return. The road was full of low and high mountain peaks and winding clear streams. After passing the Zhou Clan Temple, which has two ancient cypress trees that are hundreds of years old in the garden, as we approached the middle of Wumuling Pass, commonly known as Erdoling, the scenery of the streams and mountains was truly like being in a painting. The distant mountains of Quzhou and other places in the southwest seemed to be calling to us. Looking back, everything was clear and refreshing. After passing Wumuling, there was a large plain. The Northern Mountains were faintly visible, and a horizontal line could already be seen in the air. Fifteen li to Yongkang, we took a car back to Jinhua, and it was still three o'clock in the afternoon. Those who traveled with me were Mr. Chen Wanli, Mr. Lang Jingshan, Mr. Huang Bohui, and Mr. Zeng Yinqian from the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau.</p>
<h3>New Street Performers</h3>
<p>— Shengfu</p>
<p>When I was little, I loved to watch street performers. But there are old and new street performers. Today's street performers, of course, also have to be modernized. The old costumes were large, with at least a medicine chest, a knife bridge tied on, and a pair of... sometimes... one or several square-pointed flags. The places where they played were mostly in markets and towns, in relatively open spaces. In dense cities, they mostly chose a larger abandoned site, a vacant lot where no Western-style buildings had yet been built. The way they played was to first swagger around with gongs and drums to attract some busybodies, erect the flag, and set up the ground. They would do a few sets of boxing and stick routines, use bricks, iron rods, or blunt knives to strike their own scalps, beat their own chests, and cut their own arms, letting them bulge, turn purple, and bleed. Then, they would take out their ancestral secret ointment from the medicine chest, praise it, and apply it to the wounds they had made. As a result, the medicine would cure the disease, with their hands as proof. Then, they would hold a plate of ointment and sell it to the audience until no one paid attention. Only then would they finish.</p>
<p>The new ones, however, have no medicine chest and no knives or sticks. Although there is also a gong, the drum is probably missing. Instead, they have an extra person carrying two human figures made of cloth, with their arms wrapped around each other. This is a new advertisement, but it also shows that the new street performer himself has no martial arts skills and cannot withstand beatings. He can only tie a cloth doll on his back. The way they play is: the street performer, with the cloth doll on his back, lies down, with his hands crossed on the ground. His original two feet become the feet of the human figure on his back, and his two hands become the two legs of the other human figure. His head is covered with a piece of tattered cloth hanging from the top... The two people... Feng and Xian pilipala tumbled around, yelling in their mouths, jibafa. The gong... the tighter it is... the tighter they fight. As a result, the audience shouted their approval. The street performer got up, cupped his hands to the audience, and the audience threw coins. Everything was fine.</p>
<p>If we compare the old and new street performers, the former required more effort, requiring them to use knives and sticks. If they were not careful, they would inevitably cut a piece of skin off their stomachs. It was a small matter for them to suffer, but the most important thing was that it would affect the efficacy of the ointment, and the audience would inevitably boo. And the posturing was also very uneconomical. The new street performers, however, were much more skillful. They did not need to exert themselves. As long as they had two human figures embracing each other, they could make a grinding grain posture. And they didn't need ointment, saving them a lot of talk.</p>
<p>They both deceive the audience in the same way, but they do so with different degrees of skill. The former is gradually being replaced by the latter.</p>
<p>We often see these famous figures who have become successful by borrowing a pair of puppets, but they become heroes of street performers and no longer do this business. Therefore, his cloth puppets are thrown away somewhere at some point.</p>
<p>The times have progressed, and I can no longer see the lively street performers of my childhood. Although I have no nostalgia, I cannot help but feel that the present is not as good as the past.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (49)</h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>But when he returned to his room, he hesitated to go down to dinner. He was in too much pain. His enraged heart had not had enough time to calm down. But he finally decided to go down, and when he appeared in the dining room, everyone was already seated.</p>
<p>Everyone's face was full of joy.</p>
<p>"Well, how is your shopping going? As for me, I don't want to see anything until everything is arranged."</p>
<p>His wife replied:</p>
<p>"It's going very well. But in order to avoid buying something unsuitable, we have to consider it for a long time. Now, what worries us the most is the problem of furniture."</p>
<p>She and Zhean had looked at felt and furniture all day long. She wanted to buy slightly luxurious, spacious materials in order to attract attention. On the contrary, her son wanted the kind that was simple and elegant. So, in front of the samples that the store showed them, they once again stated their respective arguments. She meant that those customers, those litigants, had to be moved, and should feel a sense of wealth when they entered the waiting room.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Zhean only wanted to attract those elegant and wealthy customers, and wanted to conquer those intellectuals with his kind of practical and reliable taste.</p>
<p>So, the argument that had continued all day long started again from the time they were eating soup.</p>
<p>Luo Lan had no opinion. He repeated:</p>
<p>"As for me, I don't want to hear anything. I'll go and visit when you've all arranged it."</p>
<p>Grandma Luo Lan asked her eldest son for his opinion:</p>
<p>"Well, Biel, what do you think?"</p>
<p>His nerves were so stimulated that he almost wanted to answer his mother with a curse. But he said in a blunt tone with anger:</p>
<p>"Ah - as for me, I completely agree with Zhean's opinion. All I like is simplicity, and I think that the so-called simplicity in taste can be compared to the so-called honesty in character."</p>
<p>His mother continued:</p>
<p>"But you have to think that we live in a merchant city, and good taste is not suitable here."</p>
<p>Biel replied:</p>
<p>"What does that matter? Do we have to imitate those stupid things because of this? If our neighbors are all some fools or bad people, do we have to learn from them? A woman will not follow her neighbors and have a lover just because her neighbors all have lovers."</p>
<p>Zhean laughed:</p>
<p>"You're simply using metaphors from the maxims of a moral scholar as arguments."</p>
<p>Ce'er said nothing. His mother and his younger brother started talking about fabrics and armchairs again.</p>
<p>He looked at them the same way he had looked at his mother before leaving for Troville in the morning. He looked at them like a stranger observing something. He really felt like he had suddenly walked into a strange family.</p>

<h3>### Securities and Bonds Rise Suddenly - Rebound by About One and a Half Yuan - Significant Absorption in the Financial Sector - Northern Gang Rushes to Cover Short Positions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of the Chinese Securities Exchange rose completely. Although there was a small setback in the middle, the upward trend could not be contained. The attitude of the Southwest region and cooperation with the central government probably would not have further problems. In addition, there was a significant absorption in the financial sector, so the market price had a soaring trend. At the opening in the morning, the 18th and 19th year bonds were better by three, four jiao to nine jiao. Later, a large trader still had a significant settlement, so from the 20th volume onward, each slightly decreased by one, two jiao to five, six jiao. However, market sentiment did not weaken. The second round still rose sharply across the board. Numbers 4, 46, and 54 were all bought, and number 11 covered short positions especially strongly. One round rose by three, five jiao to more than one yuan. In the afternoon, another round was done. The exchange announced that due to busy trading in the afternoon, only one round would be done in the afternoon each day until the 9th. Popular sentiment was quite good. Short positions were covered, and the upward trend was still strong. The Northern Gang rushed to cover short positions very actively. Large traders still bought, and the market price rose again by three, five jiao to about one yuan. The market price settlement was that it rose by about one yuan to one yuan and six jiao across the board. The trend is that the environmental atmosphere is still good, or there may be a possibility of continued rise. The total volume of transactions was 24,257,000 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in spot, 9,450,000 yuan in total salt tax futures, 4,555,500 yuan in troop reduction, 1,830,000 yuan in the 19th Customs, 3,635,000 yuan in the 20th volume and 20th Customs, and the rest ranging from tens of thousands to 1.2-3 million.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Fluctuations Still Slight</h3>
<p>The Xin Feng Foreign Firm reported on the 2nd that the New York stock market said, "There is not much change. Although the gold price is unchanged and the US dollar is stable, the market is firm. Bond prices fluctuate. It is expected that before the currency issue has a clear development, it will generally continue to be firm." Half-day turnover was 336,000 shares. (Wheat) Argentine news was bad, long positions were closed and there was a lack of buyers, so it fell. (Cotton) The market was calm. The government's plan to severely reduce cotton fields attracted attention as the key to the long-term market. The Financial Reconstruction Corporation bought gold at a price of $34.01 per ounce, unchanged. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 99.07 Up 0.18</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 38.11 Down 0.32</p>

<p>40 Bonds 80.66 Up 0.53</p>
<p>11 Commodities 48.00 Down 0.47</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Weak State</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon, and the situation was slightly calmer, not as volatile as the previous day. Because of the continuous sharp decline in recent days, new sellers are also wary, and profit-takers are covering their positions. However, the poor situation makes it difficult to consolidate people's hearts, and the future situation is lacking in confidence.</p>
<h3>Human Contract Slightly Lower</h3>
<p>The human contract market opened in the morning, and because there were still many sellers in the market, the situation was still weak. Each month fell by 1 yuan to 1 yuan and 6.9 jiao. In the afternoon, short positions were covered, and each month rebounded by five, six jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 27,000 bales. It was found that the sales were: Chun Ji 1,350 bales, Rong Xing 1,550 bales, Sen Kang 1,350 bales, Chang Feng 1,000 bales, Xin Cheng 750 bales, Yi Chang 650 bales. The purchases were: Da Feng 1,150 bales, Yuan Da 1,600 bales, Heng Chang 1,250 bales, Da Chang 1,750 bales, Yuan Tai 550 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Human Contract Closing Price Increase/Decrease Open Interest Human Contract Closing Price Increase/Decrease Open Interest</p>
<p>December 1720 Down 5 26,550 March 1769 Down 4 31,750</p>
<p>January 1740 4 49,350 April 1783 6 20,900</p>
<p>February 1753 13 42,800 Total 171,350</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales 700+ Bales</h3>
<p>More yarn was sold today than yesterday. Statistics for the whole day show that various groups bought a total of 735 bales, with prices down by 0.5 jiao. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Nanjing 5 Luzhou 70 Ningbo 20 Guangdong 125 Shantou 5</p>
<p>Yunnan 60 Inland 285 Zhenjiang 5 Fellow Traders 80 Changsha 60</p>
<p>The cotton market started to fall and then rose. The decline in Indian cotton became more intense, and the replacement price was cheaper, so people's hearts trended downward. The demand for spot cotton was quite sluggish, and the price of the place of origin was relatively high. However, the inventory increased daily, the sales channels were not wide, and the money supply was very tight, so the market became more difficult. Local cotton merchants were still in a long position. In general, the overall situation was mediocre, and the cotton price was still much higher than the yarn price.</p>
<h3>This Month's Cotton Fell 0.35 Yuan</h3>
<p>Zheng Biao opened in the morning, and followed the fall in foreign cotton by 0.15 yuan to 0.45 yuan. In the afternoon, profit-takers covered short positions, and the market atmosphere tightened slightly. Each month rose by 0.1 yuan to 0.15 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 129,900 dan. It was found that the sales were: Sui Long 9,900 dan, Shen Chang 2,700 dan, Yu Da 2,300 dan, Da Chang 3,100 dan, Xin Hua 3,600 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 3,800 dan, Chang Yu 2,200 dan. The purchases were: Tong Ji 3,200 dan, Yuan Da 4,800 dan, Zhen Da 3,100 dan, Geng Feng 3,900 dan, Yuan Da 7,500 dan, Yu Chang 4,600 dan, Chang He 2,800 dan, De Ji 3,800 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Closing Price Increase/Decrease Open Interest Zheng Biao Closing Price Increase/Decrease Open Interest</p>
<p>December 3850 Down 35 139,100 March 3905 Down 5 147,800</p>
<p>January 3870 15 149,600 April 3935 - 112,600</p>
<p>February 3890 5 188,800 Total 782,900</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton Mill Demand Still Weak</h3>
<p>The spot cotton business is still sluggish. Because the selling price of Indian cotton is becoming more and more affordable, not many people handle Chinese cotton. The sources are estimated to be 1,000 bales of Yao cotton and 2,000 bales of Tong cotton. The current cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Xia He Cotton 36.75 Dongmian Xingsheng 200 Pieces Spot Warehouse Delivery</p>
<h3>West River Cotton Sells Well</h3>
<p>(Tianjin News on the 3rd) The West River cotton sales market is slightly more smooth. Foreign merchant transactions can still maintain a flat image. 120 bales were purchased, offered at 40 yuan and 5 jiao, and another 240 bales, offered at 40 yuan, and another 165 bales, offered at 39 yuan and 8 jiao, it is said.</p>

<h3>Last Week's Indian Cotton Market Price Fell Slightly</h3>
<p>Last week, because the meeting between India and Japan was not good, a large number of long positions were closed, and Japanese merchants sold, resulting in a slight fall in the market price. However, after the price decline, some people bought, and speculators also engaged in buying. Spot sales were bad, and Chinese transactions were quite good. In Europe, because the price difference was wide, there was a slight import. The weather was favorable, but the Central Province estimates a decrease in production. The statistics for the past week are appended below (unit: thousand bales)</p>

<h3>Flour Wheat Level at First then Rises</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the markets for each month showed a flat to rising pattern. Because the quotations for foreign wheat were about five, six, seven jiao lower for Chicago and two, three jiao lower for Canada, people's hearts were flat at the initial opening. Later, because the manufacturers watched and did not sell, and the non-industry people, due to the fact that the inventories were not yet abundant, unanimously looked up, and both near-term and far-term were eagerly collected. Therefore, although the transaction was not very smooth, the quotations trended higher. When the afternoon session opened, it was rumored that Dalian was collecting and foreign wheat was taxed, and the old story was brought up again. The current general speculation is that the market must rise when the tax is implemented, so the buying interest in the near and far terms is becoming more and more prosperous. Looking at the subsequent situation, it may still need to trend higher. As a result, the current month rose by 4 fen compared to the previous week, January rose by 3 fen, February rose by 3 fen and 7.5 li, March rose by 4 fen and 2.5 li, and April and May rose by 3.5 fen.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, the markets for each month showed a flat and hovering pattern. Because the quotations for foreign wheat were about five, six, seven jiao lower for Chicago and two, three jiao lower for Canada, people's hearts were flat at the time of quoting. The transactions for each month were also unusually light, with little in or out. When the afternoon session opened, because the flour market had entered a good phase, the transaction turned prosperous, and the market was also tight. As a result, the current month rose by 2 fen, January rose by 3 fen, February rose by 3 fen, and March rose by 4 fen. The current wheat market is stable as usual, but there are very few transactions. Gao You wheat was offered at 4 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen, totaling 300 bags, and was handled by Fu Xin.</p>
<h3>Late Rice Arrival Scarce, Rebounds by A Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source has become scarce, and each group has a total of thirty to forty households (more than five thousand stones). Among them, late rice has decreased accordingly, and the Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai gangs can continue to accommodate more than three thousand bags (four thousand stones), so the market situation has slightly turned around, and the quotations for late rice from each gang have rebounded by about a jiao. However, looking at the overall situation, it seems to be an accidental trend of temporary scarcity, and it is in a hovering state. Chang Gang, Su Tong Gang, Nan Gang and other thick japonica and Du Yang Jian, the supply and demand of stores and stomachs are mutually suitable, and the market is tight in the middle, and the hidden yuan is still mediocre.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) About forty households arrive from various places. The sales and stomachs of various colors in the market are still good. The market situation is newly broken, and Geng Yang Du Bu Ke is slightly priced and fixed. Early thin rice, Bai Yuan, Yin Yuan prices are rising.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Sales Weak and Fixed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian continued the weak trend of last week, and people's hearts and the market were trending downward. The market also continued to fall. However, the appetites of each group were active, and the local demand in Fujian Province was even more eager. Due to economic relations and transportation issues, the Fujian Gang could not handle it as smoothly as possible. Other local customers intended to suppress the market and then inquire again. After the market fell yesterday, the Quanzhou and Xiamen gangs in Fujian Province could no longer defend it, and negotiated with the British firm Taikoo Shipping to pay for a batch of cargo to be sold at the market price. 120 bags of Jiangxi Ji Wan, 600 bags of Hunan Ji Hongmi, 430 bags of Ji Jing, 100 bags of Jing Xian. This street and Ningbo then handled 400 bags of Wuhu Yuan rice, and the inland also handled 100 bags of Ye Jing. Once this customer inquired, the market turned from weak to fixed, and the price was similar to last weekend.</p>
<h3>New Red Shell Grain Opens at Three Yuan One Jiao</h3>
<p>The new red grain from Niuzhuang is successively arriving at the port. Because the purchase price does not match, there has not been a market. Yesterday, a truck of high red shell goods was seen being sold for three yuan, one jiao, one fen, and a half, a truck of Da Lu black shell goods was offered at a price of three yuan, and more than one hundred and seventy bags of Chonghong shell Chen goods were priced at three yuan and three fen, all handled by inland wineries. The source is expected to be interrupted less frequently. The sales channel only relies on one corner, and development is difficult. Moreover, the price of inland brown rice is cheap, and if the grain price rises again, this stomach is also afraid of being cut off. Other routes, such as Jiangbei, have sufficient supply and demand, so the future of the grain market has more shame than glory.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Wufu White Ice Rolling Lack Looking Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was weary due to the continuous smallness of the customs tariff and the rareness of sales. The trend turned weary. The association's planned price of 24 crude sand white ordinary goods fell another 0.15 yuan, with a slight transaction at 19.85 yuan. The market still seems difficult to stabilize. The 20th medium sand white also fell a jiao, calling for 19.65 yuan, and the 8th and 9th Dutch red ordinary goods were 15.6 yuan, slightly higher at 15.7 yuan, with a transaction of over one hundred bags, and the decline was worse. Taikoo sugar also fell by a jiao and a half, B mark called 20.1 yuan, Zhenji's own factory's cotton white number one was 18.75 yuan, number two was 0.55 yuan, number three was 0.35 yuan, and number four was 0.15 yuan, all falling by 0.1 yuan. Chao Bang number company opened a new offer of more than forty bags of green, at 15.15 yuan, and more than one hundred bags of Chen goods at 14.75 yuan. Wufu white is now because the stock is scarce and there is a lack of continued arrival, and the number board's future decision to increase the price will definitely be realized.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Shanghai Workers' Cost of Living Index for November 1933</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Social Bureau recently published the city's workers' cost of living index, stating briefly that the Shanghai workers' cost of living index compiled by the Bureau for November 1933 was 54.25, which was 3.39% lower than the previous month of this year and 2.63% lower than the same month last year. This month, due to the sharp drop in rice and vegetables, the food item fell by 6.2% compared to the previous month, and other items did not see excessive increases, so the index for this month was lower than the previous month. The various index lists are compared as follows:</p>
<p>Category November 1933 October 1933 November 1932</p>
<p>Food 80.42 85.75 81.46</p>

<p>Silver Dollar Purchasing Power 106.10 102.50 103.31</p>
<h3>Strong Outside Weak Inside Wool Market</h3>
<p>The wool market atmosphere has recently tended to soften. Looking at its appearance, it still seems strong. The association's offer price is still very high. Looking inside, it has actually weakened. The prices offered are secretly very loose, and the holders are willing to accommodate. At the moment, the most popular 1005 riding breeches are also seeing a drop of several jiao per yard in wholesale. Yesterday, the Western clothing gang on this street sold more than ten pieces, with a price of 8.4 yuan, 1009 was 8.25 yuan, number 2 goods were 6.3 yuan, 5001 Japanese goods were 7.5 yuan, Zhanghua domestic number one goods were 8 yuan, number two was 7.1 yuan, and other fine serge Huate tweed Yuan Zhigong slipover tweed, etc., are also more strong outside and weak inside. Felt ne, overcoat ne, thick goods, due to the warm weather, the market atmosphere is even more sluggish, and both domestic and foreign prices are weak.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea Foreign Firm Silk Sales Progress Difficult</h3>
<p>(Survey of Silk Stockpiles in Shanghai Silk Factories) Shanghai silk factory industry, due to the impact of Japanese silk's low-priced dumping in European and American markets, the silk price has plummeted, the silk stockpile is abundant, no one asks, the funds are stagnant, and it is impossible to support it. Most of the silk factories are shut down, and they are on the verge of bankruptcy. The Jiangxi and Zhejiang silk factory industries are now appealing to the government to find ways to provide relief, and order each factory to report the amount of silk in stock, so as to plan for unified handling. It is now found that all Shanghai silk factories have a total of 5,876 bales of white factory silk and 2,544 bales of yellow factory silk, with a cost of more than 7 million yuan, most of which are mortgaged to banks and money shops.</p>
<p>(Wuxi Silkworm Cocoons Shipped to Shanghai for Sale) The end of the year is approaching, and the Zhuang funds borrowed by general leftover cocoon customers on weekdays will expire in a blink of an eye and need to be repaid urgently. However, the dry cocoons stored in inland warehouses are not asked about, so they are all shipped to Shanghai for sale. In recent days, each cocoon customer has shipped 408 dan of double palace autumn cocoons from Wuxi, which are temporarily stored in Jiangsu warehouses for sale.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Market Continues to be Calm) Recently, the exchange rate has stabilized, and the sales of artificial silk are still not improving. Yesterday, only the Yangtze River Gang entered 22 boxes of Samsung and Five Star Pai Da Wu, etc., at a price of 181.25 yuan to 170.5 yuan net plate.</p>
<p>(Overseas Silk Electricity Transferred to Shanghai Awaiting) Yesterday, the New York silk electricity was not received in Shanghai, but according to the American silk merchant, the American silk factory labor strike was resolved, and most of them resumed work today. The sales of raw silk are gradually increasing, and the silk price is expected to rebound. However, the New York silk stockpile is abundant, and the actual sales launch still takes time. Therefore, there is gradually a glimmer of light on the American sales side. Although Lyon had a factory coming to account for the morning yesterday, the B grade thirteen and fifteen strip price was only over 600 yuan. The factory lost too much money, and the negotiation was very likely to fail. Yesterday, only Xinfu, etc., entered 10 bales of yellow factory warp, 5 bales of white dry warp, and 10 bales of gray warp, and the price turned firm.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Slightly Selling</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm tea market, the Zhenmei Baozhu from the coming firms and the native firm Zhenmei green tea, as well as the Yingzhuang Tongfu Baochang, etc., all started to handle it. The city sold a total of more than 390 boxes. The purchase offer for Wu Yuan Gaozhuang Zhenmei was 142 yuan, and the second-class goods were sold for 112 yuan. The market prices were all quite good. The selling prices of Zhenmei Baozhu and other items have also remained unchanged. At present, the stock in the market is only Wu Yuan Zhenmei and various native green teas, totaling no more than 3,000 boxes. It seems that it will not be difficult to sell out within the year.</p>
<h3>Hardware Half-Tablets Glass Spot Out of Stock</h3>
<p>Half-tablets glass is a necessity for mirror frame factories. Recently, the arrival of overseas goods has decreased significantly, so the spot goods in this city are out of stock. The standard has soared because of this, with each box (300 square feet) selling for 100 yuan, an increase of as much as 10 yuan compared to the previous. However, the customer gang and mirror frame factories are in urgent need, so delayed goods have been thrown out. It is heard that the price per box is 95 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Content and Form of "Modern"</h3>
<p>— Li Zhai</p>
<p>In recent years, I don't know which clever literati translated the English word "modern" into a transliteration "摩登" [Módēng], and wholesaled it to all sectors of Chinese society. Unexpectedly, the echoes and responses were rapid, forming a "modern whirlwind"! Thus, we all have the pleasure of witnessing: modern coats, modern shoes and socks, modern furniture, modern shops, modern massage parlors, modern architecture, modern men and women...and so on. This widespread phenomenon is endless, to put it briefly: everything is "modern," nothing is not "in vogue"!</p>
<p>Extremes beget reversals. Since "Modern" has become involved in everything, it has also become the target of condemnation among some people. In the perceptions of many "superficial" semi-intellectuals, especially old-fashioned scholars who "defend the Way," the simple and straightforward explanation of the word "modern" is mostly ignored. They believe that everything so-called "modern" refers to flamboyant costumes that fully expose curves and 1934 Western suits. As for "modern men and women," the defenders of the Way simply consider them a "separate designation" for "prodigals and harlots"! The misunderstanding grows deeper and further, with errors being passed on, and as a result, all strange and bizarre, romantic and extravagant phenomena are collectively called "modern." "Modern" has encountered such circumstances, which is certainly eye-catching, but at the same time, extremely unlucky!</p>
<p>In fact, "modern," simply means standing at the forefront of the times and striving for the "modernization" of lifestyle. It is not only an ordinary meaning but also an urgent need for mankind in the twentieth century. Especially in China, where everything is moving backward, in terms of political thought and production methods, we must strive for "modernity" to avoid being eliminated by natural selection. Should we still believe in the "political principle" of "ruling the world with half of the Analects and achieving peace with half of the Analects"? Should we still be stagnant in the production method of men plowing and women weaving, instead of applying electricity and machinery?</p>
<p>Therefore, for the noisy and controversial word "modern," we should separate its form and content, reject the "formalism" of modern, and pay attention to the content-rich modern. The past abuses of people striving for "modernization" in their lifestyles do not lie in the word "modern" itself, but in the pursuit of form by all modern followers. The inevitable result of "formalistic" "modern" is mutual influence, focusing on "modern" efforts in consumption and enjoyment. Thus, Western suits, dancing, sensual business cards, lipstick, dimples, stockings, perfume, high heels, and curves are consciously or unconsciously regarded by devout men and women as important conditions for constituting "modern." The greatest loss of "formalistic" "modern" is not at all, as the moralistic gentlemen recognize, turning into a "flood of human desires," but the following points:</p>
<p>1.  Provide feudal forces and conservatives with an excuse to counterattack: "Abstaining from eating for fear of choking" is the consistent logic of our "national essence enthusiasts." Because formalism of modern has abuses, they advocate "restoration of the past." All "restoring the inherent moral spirit of the nation," using ancient music to worship Confucius, reprinting the Analects and Classic of Filial Piety, and restricting the use of Western-style stationery are direct reactions to the conservatives' intention to oppose all "modern" words and deeds.</p>
<p>2.  Provide imperialists with an opportunity to expand the market for luxury goods: Striving for formalism of modern will inevitably lead to desperately purchasing foreign cosmetics and all luxury goods. Therefore, in the past January, there were three to four hundred boxes of Japanese mirrors and high heels imported, so the newspapers of "friendly countries" praised with delight: "The purchasing power of Chinese women is increasing, and the atmosphere on the streets has suddenly become lively"! Alas! Chinese "modern" women! What kind of taste do you feel when you read the praise in Japanese newspapers: sour, sweet, bitter, or spicy?</p>
<p>3.  Provide some pawnshops with many "original modern clothes": The styles of modern clothes and accessories usually change several times a year, allowing tailors and experts to innovate. Therefore, the clothes of truly modern men and women are worn at most five or six times before being put on the shelf. As a result, these "odd-shaped" and "disliked by the poor and unloved by the rich" clothes, after being "relegated to the cold box" for a long time, will mostly be transferred to the "eternal storage," and before entering, the owner has already sentenced them to "life imprisonment." After the pawnshop is fully stocked, they can only be taken to Shiliu Road and Beijing Road to be shaken back and forth by the clerks, shouting slogans, but it is still "disliked by the poor and unloved by the rich"!</p>
<p>4.  Increase the decadent mood of extravagance and pleasure among young people in the upper and middle classes: The modern movement focuses on form, resulting in the pursuit of excessive stimulation and enjoyment in clothing, food, housing, transportation, sound, and color, while personal future, nation, and country are all included in the "who cares" budget. For example, when Rehe fell and Tianjin and Beijing were in danger, some modern men and women in Beijing still danced and skated as usual. To be honest, "modern" to this extent is simply "souls in the pot" who do not know life or death on the eve of decline!</p>
<p>The correct and necessary correction to the above "ridiculously absurd" formalism of modern is to strive to enrich the content of "modernization" in all lifestyles, words, and actions. In other words, in terms of political awareness and cultural thought, we should stand at the forefront of the times, shout fewer slogans, sing fewer high-profile tunes, and practice diligently in a down-to-earth manner. At the same time, all "formalistic" "modern" should be criticized and opposed mercilessly!</p>
<h3>Demon Grinding</h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>After dinner, I put on my felt hat, ready to go to the newspaper office. Xia suddenly stopped me and told me to wait a moment. There's a new spectacle, take a look, so you can write a story and add some new material. I asked her what it was, but she just giggled, "I don't know what it is, but I know it's a strange and interesting trick. Just wait and see." She gave me such an unclear answer, leaving me in confusion.</p>
<p>As the lights came on, the house where we lived, the back room of Widow Zhao's, suddenly filled with a large crowd of people. At the same time, Zhao's widow, with a sad and nervous expression on her face, hurriedly closed the doors and windows. At this moment, Xia pulled my hand and said, "If we don't go now, we'll be locked out and won't be able to see." So, involuntarily, I followed Xia to the back room. I went through the door. Looking around, there were more than thirty men and women crowded in the house. They stood, sat, held their breath, and were solemn and humorous, as if they were waiting for the judge to open the court. In the whispers of the crowd, I learned that Zhao's widow had invited a "fairy" tonight to perform the "demon grinding" ceremony. Beside the large table, the man in the robe and felt hat was the "fairy." It was said that his magic was extremely effective.</p>
<p>"Demon grinding," what a novel and unique name. Maybe it's a groundbreaking ghost show, that's why so many people came to see it.</p>
<p>In the center of the room, there was a square table. On the table, there was only an incense burner and a few strings of silver. The table was surrounded by black cloth on three sides, with only the north side empty. Under the table, there was a small rattan basket, inside which was a bowl of white rice. This ghost show only had these simple arrangements.</p>
<p>In the silence, the man suddenly took off his robe and hat, straightened his clothes, looked around with his eyes, and said to Zhao's widow with a solemn expression, "There are too many people, I'm afraid the yang energy is too strong. The souls may not dare to come, especially men with strong yang energy will offend them! How about asking the men to leave?" Zhao's widow's only hope in inviting the "fairy" today was to communicate with her beloved husband, who had been dead for more than a year. Now, hearing that men were an obstacle to her husband's soul, she couldn't help but feel anxious. So, she issued an eviction order and drove the unfamiliar men out of the house. The ghost show began. The man [fairy] first wrote Zhao's husband's name, age, and date of death on a piece of paper, burned it with fire, and considered it a subpoena from the underworld. Then he ordered the audience to squat on the ground and not to approach the table. Then he held a wooden plate in his hand and used a wine cup to rub it on the plate non-stop. In the "whirring" sound, he ordered Zhao's widow to crawl under the black cloth and ask questions to the rattan basket. The ghost's soul would answer, but the attitude should be sincere and the heart should be sincere, otherwise the ghost would get angry and leave. Zhao's widow listened to his instructions, crawled under the table, and asked, "Who are you?" "I am Zhao Taosheng," "How old are you?" "Thirty-two years old," "When did you die?" "Last August," "Who can I rely on after you die?" "..." At this moment, the rattan basket suddenly started to cry softly. Zhao's widow, hearing this, felt sad and stopped asking questions and started crying softly as well. After the ghost show stopped, the audience discussed, "Asking knowledgeable men to leave, I'm afraid they'll see through his flaws." "The ghost's voice is coming out of his mouth behind the curtain, so he's using the sound of the grinding disc to confuse things." "You think, the few accurate words were just told to him by Zhao's widow, written on the subpoena. When asked about things he wasn't told, he used crying to get by."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid people standing up will see through his actions behind the scenes, so he told everyone to squat down." But Zhao's widow was still so convinced, her eyes red from crying. She told everyone how effective the "fairy" was, and the price of thirty yuan was still cheap! Alas! How deep is the superstition of the Chinese people!</p>
<h3>Boring Sunday</h3>
<p>— Li Yue</p>
<p>After Monday begins, I look forward to Sunday with excitement, but every time Sunday brings me boredom, in addition to shattering all the pleasant fantasies that arise out of thin air on Saturday night, what remains is only cursed fatigue and an inability to recover! Yes, in this era, is "Sunday" really something we have a share of?</p>
<p>Another boring Sunday came in my subconscious expectation. I thought with some indignation: Should we really let the work of cattle and horses occupy our whole body and mind? Who planned that "Sunday" is not for us? Therefore, I made up my mind, I want to fight! But where to "resist" from? The question is in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>"Damn it, forget about it, I still have a few cents in my pocket, go see a movie, have fun today!" Like giving up on myself, or like being angry with someone, I ran to the "×× Theater" in one breath.</p>

<h3>Modern Celebrity Calligraphy and Painting</h3>
<p>— Work by Mr. Zhu Qishi</p>
<p>Inside, I bought a ticket and sat in a corner of the last row, holding my head up.</p>
<p>Because a lot of grievances filled my whole heart, sitting alone in the crowd, confused and complicated thoughts, ups and downs, I simply didn't know who the people around me were. At this time, even if someone were to ask me what the name of the upcoming movie was, I would be equally blank and unable to answer.</p>
<p>Suddenly, darkness occupied the surroundings, and on the white curtain in front of me began to jump the shadows of gentlemen-like men in suits and women dressed like goblins with curly hair. Irritable music forcefully shook my eardrums, feeling strangely uncomfortable. "Oh, a standard beauty! Oh, I like this face, this beautiful and delicate face!" When the shadow of a fat-faced, big-hipped woman with high breasts swayed on the curtain, such a surprised and envious cry came from the seat next to me, strangely harsh, like a woman's voice. Then, something furry with a pungent smell touched my ear, and I turned my head sharply, my heart beating as if I had been extremely frightened.</p>
<p>"Sir, standard beauty is so beautiful! Wait a moment, she will perform bathing later!..." The woman's voice in the next seat came faintly from the furry thing. Because of her suddenness, I felt uneasy and embarrassed that I couldn't cope, but the furry thing was getting closer and closer to me, almost touching my face. I really felt it was annoying, but unconsciously I still answered with a nasal sound - "Um, um. ...", turning my head further away.</p>
<p>After about ten minutes of silence, the words "Rest" in art fonts appeared on the curtain, and the lights shone brightly again. I rubbed my eyes and yawned wildly.</p>
<p>"Sir, are you tired? ...Haha! Is the standard beauty not enough? Ha!" This somewhat familiar, coquettish, ear-stimulating voice reminded me to shift my gaze to my seat next to me. A long, thin face that was pale and covered with furry, curly, long hair emitting a pungent smell quickly flew into my eyes: blood-red lips were spitting out smoke rings, and dark, bright, and sparkling eyes were constantly glancing at the four seats, and a flat chest was breathing irregularly. She looked at me and smiled unnaturally with pursed lips when she saw me look at her silently. I dared not pay attention to her, pretending not to see her, and raised my head to look at the ceiling, which was painted with uncoordinated and unevenly colored and lined patterns, and my heart trembled a little, and then I yawned heartily again.</p>
<p>The space returned to the darkness of the first half of the time, and a lot of shadows reappeared on the curtain. Irritable music was still shaking my eardrums, and I felt an uncomfortable stimulation. However, this time she, the strange woman in the seat next to me, no longer brushed my face with the furry thing, nor did she talk to me again, or rather, talk to herself in a coquettish and ear-piercing voice. Almost even the sound of her irregular breathing was inaudible. However, I still calmly raised my head and dared not look at her sideways. Because of this silence, I was able to see more clearly the things reflected on the curtain: a bewitching woman was sitting naked in a bathtub bathing, tilting her head coquettishly and talking to a gentleman-like man in a suit outside the door. I also saw it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the fat-faced, big-hipped woman with high breasts in the curtain committed suicide because she failed to propose to the gentleman-like man! I opened my eyes and watched with some incomprehension, thinking there would be a lot more to come. But what was reflected on the curtain next was no longer a character, only a large "The End" character. The music stopped with it, and the lights were shining. I stood up lazily and yawned wildly. Then, I found that the seat next to me was empty, and the strange middle-aged woman had left at some point. The people around me also stood up and tidied their collars; many people were still shouting in their mouths, "It's a pity, such a delicate and beautiful woman actually committed suicide!" I squeezed into the crowd and flowed out to the center of the road inexplicably. I took a deep breath and then yawned as I pleased.</p>
<p>Boring Sunday, it always brings me cursed and frustrating boredom!</p>
<h3>Taking Pleasure in Others' Misfortune</h3>
<p>— Tao Guanghan</p>
<p>"The heart of compassion, everyone has it," this is a fact. But the psychology of "taking pleasure in others' misfortune" is almost universal. If two good men happen to be fighting at the entrance of the alley, some busybodies will surround them and clap their hands and cheer to encourage them. Sometimes a rickshaw is knocked over by a car on the road, the passenger rolls off the car, his head is broken and bleeding, and the rickshaw puller is also injured. Many idlers who stop to watch will laugh. Fire alarms are even more lively, and residents from near and far will come to watch. Even beheading scenes often attract countless spectators. Because these small and large events, regardless of the severity of the disaster, are viewed as a "comedy," so everyone is happy to watch. Moreover, the victims of the disaster are others, not the bystanders themselves or their own people, so it is naturally more interesting to watch!</p>
<p>Generally speaking, taking pleasure in others' misfortune is triggered by a kind of curiosity. But some situations are different. A and B have a feud. Now B is suddenly framed. A can't help but feel happy in his heart. Although the perpetrator is not A himself, the victim is the enemy B, as if someone is avenging him. Some people are bullied by their neighbors. Occasionally, the neighbor's child dies pitifully, and this person feels very happy, thinking that the principles of heaven are really accurate. This kind of taking pleasure in others' misfortune contains malice.</p>
<p>Taking pleasure in others' misfortune has other effects, that is, hoping that others suffer disasters, so that oneself can gain benefits. This needs to be explained with examples. Japan's psychology of taking pleasure in our country's misfortune belongs to this kind. Our country has suffered from natural and man-made disasters for many years, which is a great misfortune for us, but from the Japanese point of view, they secretly celebrate it. Because they can take advantage of our difficulties to intensify their oppression and control our destiny.</p>

<h3>My Sister's Braid</h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>When the Northern Expedition took place fifteen years ago, I was suffering from a non-serious illness, the city was in a state of emergency, and the countryside was so poor that you couldn't even buy a copper coin with a gun. So my father put on an excited face and told me not to go to school. I stayed at home to recuperate and also ran a small peddling-style school.</p>
<p>Only three days after the school sign was erected, quite a few children came to "enroll." I realized that the times had arrived, and selling plaster could be turned into selling ginseng. So, excited, I sat upright near the collapsing table, took out ink, took out a pen, took out the colorful foreign paper I brought back from the city, and took out a flower-headed advertising mentality that I had learned from the city: "Rely on advertising to attract business." I began to try advertising. I still remember the first sentence was "The times have arrived!" The second sentence was still "The times have arrived!" It was not until the third sentence that I gently steered the rudder: "This school enrolls both boys and girls." This advertisement was posted far and wide, and quite a few masters, wives, servants, and maids came to inquire about the tone of the school: "Enrolling both boys and girls is indeed a new method, which is appropriate, but I don't know if the rules are strict?" At that time, I was responsible for answering: "Mixed schools in the city are inevitably somewhat sloppy. As for our temple, it is very responsible. No matter how open the city is, whether it is holding nude meetings or dance parties, boys and girls of all ages must attend separate classes in our temple! Parents can rest assured!" So some people enrolled on the spot before going back.</p>
<p>On the opening day, eight female students came in a row, all of them were daughters of good families, and their ages were all around fourteen or fifteen. There were nearly forty male students, both big and small, walking and jumping, laughing and joking. In fact, it was not allowed to separate classes, so they were mixed in one hall. The female students huddled in a corner, shrinking their waists and giggling.</p>
<p>In the evening, my ten-year-old little sister asked me: "Brother, you said that the female students would be separated into classes. Why haven't they been separated today? Will they be separated tomorrow? If they are separated, I also want to study. Mom has already allowed me!" I said: "Okay, but there is one condition. First, you have to cut off your braid." "Oh, no, then I'd rather not study?" My sister turned around and ran away quickly.</p>
<p>The next day, my sister came to ask again. I still offered the condition of cutting the braid. I said: "The other female students are preparing to cut it, as long as you take the lead. If you follow my words, I won't charge you tuition fees. You can use the tuition fees that Dad gave you to buy candy. And I will give you books, ink, pens, and paper, as long as you take the lead!" This made my sister agree, but my mother refused to the death. She said, "Teaching is teaching, don't make such new tricks. What will it look like if the braid is cut off? It will look like a camel chicken!" My second sister-in-law also echoed next to her: "Bao Gu, when someone comes to inquire about marriage, they will say you're a camel chicken." But before she could elaborate, I had already cut off my sister's braid.</p>
<p>My sister was fine. She was not annoyed by this. My mother and sister-in-law had no choice. From then on, my sister persuaded more for me. As a result, five of the eight female students' braids were also cut off. Everyone said it was more convenient and cleaner than before, and the faces under the short hair were all more beautiful than before. Only the three who had not cut their hair dropped out and did not come. I never tried to use my advertisement again.</p>
<p>The school was running for less than a year. There was trouble in the city, and the countryside was also a little disturbed. But my sister still had short hair, and the other female students still had short hair. They all acknowledged the benefits of short hair.</p>
<p>Later, my body recovered, and I left my hometown far away. Over the years, I often remembered my sister's hair. Was it still short? Or had she grown her braid again?</p>
<p>When I returned to my hometown recently, I really didn't expect my sister to have grown her braid again. And she had grown up in proportion to others, twice as big as before, three times as long, and she complained to me, saying that it took a lot of effort to grow it back. My mother had passed away, and my second sister-in-law stood next to her and said: "Because she didn't have a braid, she lost many good opportunities to get engaged!" My sister even said: "The braids of the five female students from before have all grown longer than mine!" I just responded with "Um, um, um."</p>
<p>Naturally, everything in the long-lost hometown - the accumulated abuses, the darkness - had grown bigger, like my sister growing her braid again.</p>
<p>The times have arrived, and the times have slipped away again.</p>
<h3>Acting as a Living Pawn</h3>
<p>— Village Person</p>
<p>To pawn things like clothes, bedding, and furniture is a common occurrence for poor people. In the city, impoverished households pawn their winter clothes in the summer to redeem their summer garments, and in the autumn, they pawn their summer garments to redeem their winter clothes. It is a perfectly normal thing that no one can mock anyone for. When poor people have nothing left to pawn, they often sigh and say, "If only people could be pawned, we wouldn't have to worry about rent or food and would even have money to use." Now, the reality of pawning living people exists. This era is truly full of wonders! However, this matter is actually a transaction undertaken by our "friendly neighbor" to the east with our China, with the aim of purchasing laborers to develop their "frontier defenses." This is a major event that deserves the attention of our Chinese compatriots.</p>
<p>In ancient times, during the Warring States period of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, there was also the practice of pawning living people. However, that involved princes and relatives going to foreign countries as guarantees of peace, called "hostages." Although this also had the meaning of pawning, it differed from the meaning of pawning objects. Pawning objects is borrowing money (and paying interest) with the object as collateral, with the emphasis on the borrowing of money. The Warring States period used princes and relatives as hostages, with the emphasis on peace. Pawning living people for the sake of peace is something we can all approve of. Pawning living people to borrow money, on the other hand, we find unreasonable. Moreover, our "friendly neighbor" to the east has a specific purpose in pawning living people from the poor.</p>
<p>Pawning living people does still exist in present society, that is, when people need money, they pawn their daughters to wealthy families as slaves, hoping to redeem them later. However, there is no interest, and the term is very long, at least a year or two. Now, our "friendly neighbor" to the east has opened pawnshops in Tangshan, China, to pawn living people from the poor—our poor compatriots—limiting it to young people under the age of twenty and stipulating that if they are not redeemed within two months, they become permanently forfeited. The permanently forfeited living people are to be sent to the Northeast—"our Chinese territory"—to develop "frontier defenses." Furthermore, they stipulate one dollar per year of age, with interest at several cents or even one or two dimes or more—this is clearly purchasing people within our Chinese territory! Why do we say this? One dollar per year of age, so even if every young person is twenty years old, they are only worth twenty dollars. This already shows that human life is worthless, not to mention the high interest and the two-month deadline for permanent forfeiture. Isn't this purchasing people at a low price?</p>
<p>The matter of purchasing people occurred during the Manchu Qing Dynasty when imperialists were developing desolate mountains in Southeast Asia. They employed Chinese traitors to buy "piglets" to work as laborers. From the commercial ports of Guangdong, such as Macau, Guangzhou, and Shantou, as well as Xiamen and Fuzhou in Fujian, and Shanghai, Ningbo, and Wenzhou in Zhejiang, many "piglets" were exported every year. The compatriots who became "piglets" had different situations, some willing and some unwilling. Most of the willing compatriots were lured with the promise of getting rich once they arrived in Southeast Asia, while the unwilling compatriots were ignorant villagers who were deceived and put on iron ships. Now, our "friendly neighbor" to the east is engaging in this activity, playing a different trick by using the method of pawning living people to purchase people. In terms of its nature, it is no different from buying "piglets," but in terms of its method, it seems "open and aboveboard" to buy people with money rather than deception, and those who are unwilling are not forced. This is such a cunning and insidious evil act!</p>
<p>Our China has suffered from continuous human and natural disasters. In Shaanxi, a person's life is not even worth the price of a loaf of bread. Our "friendly neighbor" to the east is using this clever method to purchase people. How can the poor not flock to it like ducks to water? Moreover, there are also Chinese traitors instigating, luring, and deceiving them. And these purchased "piglets," once they arrive in the Northeast—"our Chinese territory"—will be used in two ways: one is to raise them as people of "Manchukuo," labor-type people to be beasts of burden for their empire; the other is to raise them as soldiers in the basic forces of "Manchukuo" to be cannon fodder, to develop "frontier defenses," and to "suppress" our volunteer army and fight against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>That living people can be pawned like objects is already strange, but that they are sent to the Northeast after permanent forfeiture to develop "frontier defenses" is even more shocking! However, when newspapers publish this news—and it is indeed news—they only report the information and no other news, such as the local government opposing, protesting, or banning it... which is especially surprising. Perhaps this is a non-explicit provision under an agreement? Then it is truly a gift of "friendship," not only should we not be surprised, but we should also celebrate peace and prosperity.</p>
<h3>Psychological Adaptation</h3>
<p>— Mu Lang</p>
<p>Despite how the social economy is dying, people's enthusiasm for certain "contributions" will not gradually fade; although they are not very willing to do general patriotic undertakings, this kind of "contribution" is also a kind of patriotic action.</p>
<p>The petty bourgeoisie are being tormented and left gasping for breath by the cruel struggles of society. The heavy burden of reality has crushed them into "dried-up people." They are terrified, passive, and decadent. They yearn to escape this circle of reality. Thus, their only aspiration is to strike it rich without effort; this can help them retreat into a relatively quiet corner to coldly watch others fight. Except for their own survival from being swallowed by the waves, they don’t care about anything else! What caters to the mentality of the petty bourgeoisie is the rise of fortune tickets and things that are similar to gambling, because this is the only medicine that can cure their mental illness. And why not add a layer of national salvation to this? Thus, even if the petty bourgeoisie buy them and don't win, they can still comfort themselves that they have done their part in fulfilling their duty to save the country, lightly wiping away their own selfish nature of escaping reality. This is why other national salvation undertakings cannot be done, while these kinds of national salvation actions can be carried out.</p>
<p>The desires of the petty bourgeoisie are shallow and short-sighted. Their "consciences" are very "flat." They almost all say, "Even if I don't win the grand prize, having a second or third prize would be enough. If not, getting a small prize would still be good. With this money, I can go to the countryside and use it for the rest of my life!" According to the two most important principles of "supply" and "demand" in economics, with these "step back" demands of the petty bourgeoisie, there must be a large supply that satisfies their demands. Therefore, selling fortune tickets in strips makes their purchasing power more convenient and expands their original hopes several times. Although the original quality of each hope is also reduced several times compared to before, it still makes the petty bourgeoisie feel very satisfied.</p>
<p>Now, the psychology of the petty bourgeoisie is being understood more and more thoroughly. The end of the year is what we value most. Getting rich and celebrating the New Year, peacefully drinking rice cake soup, is there anything more comfortable than this in the world?</p>

<h3>Shanghai (11)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Lao San</p>
<p>"Qingping"—sounding surprised, as if discovering a secret, the throaty voice called out my name.</p>
<p>I recognized that the voice came from the crowd behind me. Are there people among them who know me? Doubting, I turned around, unexpectedly seeing those old friends whom I had wrongly suspected of being romantic students, scattered in various places. I almost didn't trust my own eyes.</p>
<p>"Ah, Qingping, we've been looking out for you for a long time! Haha..." a cheer, raising their glasses.</p>
<p>"How are you all in Shanghai?" At the time when I was wandering aimlessly, I met this group of old friends. Under the extreme joy, I asked them in surprise.</p>
<p>"How are you also in Shanghai?" Little Huang, nicknamed "Dwarf Gourd," jumped onto the stool and made a face at me.</p>
<p>"Ha...ha..." laughter burst out of the window.</p>
<p>19 Two Experts in Love</p>
<p>This group of young people were all members of the Zhengyi Society, which was organized in school. Later, due to suspicion regarding their writings, they all fled to other cities. The Zhengyi Society also disbanded without a trace. The president, Gao Fei, was the core member who initiated the society. He spent a lot of energy and money to support the Zhengyi Society. The Zhengyi magazine, which was published, was very popular among young students. Later, with the help of the school, they established a Zhengyi free night school to benefit poor children. The Zhengyi Society also had a considerable position and reputation in society; however, after we graduated and wanted to dedicate ourselves to the Zhengyi Society, the opinions of the members became divided. Moreover, young people who had just entered society were inevitably willful and arrogant. In one issue of the magazine, they discussed the chaos of the party and government, lightly incurring the accusation of being left-leaning. Unable to do anything else, the Zhengyi Society disbanded, the members separated, and I also returned to my hometown...</p>
<p>Gao Fei clasped my hand tightly and said, "Did you receive our letter?"</p>
<p>I shook my head, having no clue about their sudden gathering this time.</p>
<p>"Fei, it's a long story, tell me about your affairs first."</p>
<p>Gao Fei said: After he fled to Hankou, he became acquainted with friends in military and political circles. He tried his best to lobby the authorities, and the Zhengyi Society has regained its freedom. The members are all in low spirits, and I feel that it is necessary to reorganize this society. I earnestly wrote letters to everyone, hoping to eliminate differences and work together to revive our Zhengyi Society. Today's gathering is a memorial to the resurrection of our Zhengyi Society, and yet we meet you here.</p>
