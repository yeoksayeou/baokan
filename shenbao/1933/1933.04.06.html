<h3>時評</h3>
<h3>美國建艦計劃與日本統治南洋羣島信</h3>
<p>一華盛頓會議之回顧</p>
<p>太平洋上風雲緊急。日美兩國關係。一張一弛。戰雲低迷。形勢嚴重。美國在金融恐慌方始渡過。一切問題正待積極努力解决之際。而建設新艦隊之計劃。并不因此而提議中止。最近且擬於一九三六年之前。完成驅逐艦二十艘。輕巡洋艦五艘。潛水艦四艘。航空母艦一艘。是皆一九三○年倫敦條約所允許。用以代替美國今日腐朽老齡之舊艦者也。就事實而論。無畏式戰鬭艦。美國雖以十四艘對日本之十艘。設使太平洋上作戰。美以五千餘哩之海程。亦難採取攻勢。以應付日本之近海作戰。重巡洋艦則美日之間。無大軒輊。合輕巡洋艦計之。美國雖總噸數多出一萬一千噸。但艦齡老大。且少五隻。（日本計有重輕巡洋艦二十七·美國則僅二十二艘·）美國顯居劣勢。潛水艦艇日本擁有七十二艘。噸位大而續航力强。在大洋上行動。尤具有便利優美之設備。其潛水艦隊。堪稱當世第一。美國亦自問不及。然則華盛頓會議當時。所謂五·五·三·比率者何也。蓋以海軍總噸數而論。英美均等。日本僅及其十分之六。意在圖英美之均衡。致日本不能不採取守勢耳。惟彼時遠東情勢。并不似今日之緊張。美國之欲開發東亞。亦不如近日之積極。日帝國主義獨占的野心。尤不似今日之露骨兇暴。故美國採用守勢的進攻。以英美暫時均衡。博世界和平。以不繼續建築菲利濱及關島要塞。不擴大亞細亞艦隊。换取海軍休息。使日本承諾十對六之比率。保持美國海軍之優勢。</p>
<p>不料事勢變遷。往往出人意料之外。倫數條約之後。日本海軍與英美比率。已由三比五而增至六·九比十。巡艦潛艇。且立於同等地位矣。於是東洋均勢之局。難再保持。日美裂痕。愈益深大。日帝國主義之欲侵吞我中國。更加急劇。其開始以暴力攫取之地。又在北而不在南。且以封鎖蘇聯﹁赤化。﹂阻止我國民族革命之號召。首先赢得英國之同情。致美國雖甚激怒而亦無能爲力。僅於萬難之中。惟有徵集大西洋艦隊常駐太平洋上。以保持東太平洋之霸權。待未來之時機。順應目前之急變。對遠在六千浬外之菲利濱與夫置諸日本門口之炸彈丨關島。一時難取密切聯絡。亦姑置之。以待建艦計劃實現之後。再圖收拾而巳。</p>
<p>二日本占領南洋羣島擴大軍事支配力</p>
<p>美國旣以菲利濱相距遙遠。乃不能不反圖鞏·固其根本·建設眞珠港爲太平洋上之根據地。與三的哥及舊金山港之主力。互爲犄角。確定其保守的優勢。使敵國之日本。不能在東部太平洋。作任何積極行動。惟近代戰爭之技術。白見進步。其中尤以飛行部隊之活躍爲特色。美國必欲克服其在遠東軍事棍據地薄弱之困難於菲利濱。關島之外。不能不另尋出路。其出路爲何。即阿拉斯卡之活用是也。在極北之一角。縱不能建立强固之海軍根據地。且氷凍阻隔。艦隊行動。亦感不便。而水上飛機之飛行塲。建築旣不費力。對於攻擊日本。較關島尤多便利。不過兒時爆炸飛機積載有效之炸彈。其繼續飛行力。應不能超過一千公里。然飛行技術日新月異。績航能力。亦漸增加。則阿拉斯卡飛行塲對日本之威脅。遂不下於關島矣。</p>
<p>日本處此時際。南受脅制於關島。北感威壓於阿拉斯卡。乃不能不預自籌劃。其第一着先充實其海軍内容。目的在於日美開戰後最短時間能攫取馬尼剌。攻破關島。使美國艦隊西來。無立足地。而日本反可收切擊之效。以故日本前此海軍之作戰計劃。在沿小笠原島琉球台灣成一弧形。以保持黄海東海之絶對支配權。今且視爲未足。其每一線將沿小笠原島以延至馬里亞納而迄於巴拉俄羣島。收關島。則菲利濱入其掌握。且可虎視夏威夷。進窺﹁金門﹂矣。故必欲强言自解曰。﹁南洋羣島之統治。日本國防之生命線也。﹂我人從軍事上觀之。日本旣作種種有力之軍事防禦。其强度雖或不及馬尼剌。而其支撑力則較關島過之。矧彼海軍根據地横須賀及吳軍港之接應。亦極便利。西太平洋可任日本横行。遠東市場。可讓日本獨占。此種形勢之發展。至近日而愈見迫切矣。惟就一般經濟的政治的觀察。日美兩國。皆無單獨挑戰。或獨自出而應戰之可能。故僅有急速準備軍實。向火藥庫中添置炸藥。至於以何事引火。則尚待新事實之如何開展耳。</p>

<p>華聯社五日東京電　關於高橋財長辭職問題、軍部初取靜觀態度、欲期待軍人專政、但財界及政界對軍閥之武斷政策、不但表示不滿意、對中日前途甚抱悲觀、因國内情形亦與軍閥所期正反、故軍部改變其政策、阻止財長下台、高橋在職中、關於財源方面及境稅政策、與軍部雖略有出入、但所需經費、却慨然支出、除軍人自組軍事内閣以外、比高橋更好之傀儡、恐甚難得、聞陸軍部内﹂反對政變漸加濃厚、而且財界内部多倡從早對華謀妥協、挽救垂危之經濟局面、政友會暗中亦勾結在内、此種環境更使荒木一派支持現閣、聞荒木陸相定日内親訪高橋、表示軍部熱誠、極力挽留云、</p>
<h3>民政黨支持現閣</h3>
<p>電通社五日東京電　民政黨極重視政局之前途、以期對策之無誤、依目下之情形、藏相之撤回辭呈恐甚困難、以爲地方長官會議後、於五﹁五事件解决前後、藏相之辭職將實現、然齋藤首相因經西園寺公之激勵、决心留居内閣、故藏相雖辭職、將以後任補充、又小山法相雖引咎辭職、亦僅内閣之一部份改造、故終無總辭職之舉也、而民政黨終將始終維持現内閣也、因此松田幹事長於今晨往小山首相私邸訪問、聽取政局問題之眞相、及於内閣之影響、並交換種種意見、故在民政黨爲打開非常時局、决依極力維持現内閣之方針進行、而依此旨趣以督促齋藤首相、俾善處時局云、</p>

<p>路透四日倫敦電　英政府提交下院禁止俄貨入口之議案文頗簡短、僅有四欵、主張政府以命令禁止蘇俄聯邦所出産或製造各種貨物之輸入而已、此案將於四月十八日起發生效力、凡轉口者不適用之、此案規定凡半在俄國製造半在他處製造之物品、苟未能證明該貨自離俄境後成於他處者、至少佔其價值四分之一、則槪作俄貨論、此案又載有因宣佈禁令致未能履行契約之救濟辦法、此案授權商部、對於應禁貨物之輸入、得發特殊執照、此案二讀後、反對黨領袖克利浦今晚動議打銷此案、謂白披書未曾表示英政府要求不加審問即釋放被捕諸人之充分理由、亦未表示英政府爲對俄報復起見、須取得本案内所提議的特殊權力之充分理由云、</p>

<h3>遇救海軍少佐報告美大飛船失事經過</h3>
<p>一萬六千呎高空冒大風雨飛行</p>
<p>深夜電光包圍中被迫降落海面</p>
<p>船身經不起巨浪撼擊立成韲粉</p>
<p>海軍航空局長等七十三人罹難</p>
<p>路透四日紐約電　海軍少佐維萊發來無線電報、報告四月三日夜十時至午夜間海軍大飛船阿克朗號失事情形、維萊爲遇救三人之一、初由德船福布斯號救起、嗣登海濱巡船克特號、該電即由特克號發出者、此爲所接第一次官報、内稱、阿克朗號於昨夜十時爲電包圍、時在一萬六千呎之高度冒大風雨飛行、不時更改方向、旋於午夜開始下降、後半小時、乃擲下其鎭壓砂囊、维時仍四面皆電、且顛動頗烈、其降落時、船尾向下、無何、其舵頓失、於是該船即觸及水面、登時破壞、時電光閃爍不已、照見海上景狀、至足恐怖、初見諸人奮其死力、泅於飛船殘物中、一刹那間、即全消没、在破毁之前、駕駛處完全鎭定、絶無驚亂之象云、</p>
<p>七十六人遇險生還僅有三人今查明阿克朗號中之軍官十九員、應募之船員五十七人、有下落者僅五人、四人由德船福布斯號救起、但其一未幾即死、餘一爲海軍少佐麥克里蘭、其屍於今日撈起、獲救之三人、爲海軍少佐維萊、船員第爾與歐文、海軍執行官格浦蘭雖遇救、後仍死於福布斯號船中、海軍巡船特克號今日巳將獲救三人送登岸上、彼等皆拒絶談話、惟維萊衣極緊縮之軍服、喃喃曰余甚安云、第爾登岸後、即以救傷便牀送入醫院、其人於一九二五年美海軍飛船希南圖號失事時亦遇險獲救、刻仍有多船、在浮於海面之阿克朗號殘物中尋覓遇難者、但爲雨霧窒碍、至感困難、阿克朗號失事處距巴根萊特燈船約二十里、</p>
<p>大飛船共三艘今已失去其二阿克朗號之失事、據一般人士意見、實予大飛船以致命傷、大飛船在商業上與軍事上從此恐無人提倡矣、調查阿克朗號失事之委員會主席文森氏宣稱、今後不致再造大飛船、美國共造三艘、巳失其二、查美國共費美金二千萬元建造此種飛船、而已毁者爲希南圖號與今之阿克朗號、今僅餘一艘、名瑪康號、海軍部長史潢生今日言、渠對於大飛船從未如他人之熱心、又稱、阿克朗號之姊妹飛船瑪康號、將照原議遣往西海濱與艦隊合作云、阿克朗號罹難者中最有名望之一、爲海軍部航空局局長穆裴德海軍少將、一九三二年一月份全國航空月刊中曾載有該將關於阿克朗之論文一篇、謂阿克朗號雖體量過重、但航行力在尋常狀况下並不受有影響、又謂其增重之原因、由於海軍部下令更改、以增進其安全及軍事效有云、</p>
<p>飛船隨浪飄流船身目覩全毁</p>
<p>路透五日紐约電　海軍少佐維萊衣醫院便服、今日向報館訪員一團述阿克朗號失事情形、據謂、飛船並無觸電之象、船中並未爆炸、亦未起火、午夜將近、飛船開始疾降、時發動機均開足速力、渠將船中所載之嚴重沙　、畫投海中、飛船前　距地約八百呎後、旋即飛起、在距地約一千五百呎處、始告穏定、三分鐘後、空氣忽不寗靜、船首上舉頗甚、渠知已近大鳳之中心點、即命船中全數之人準備、飛船旋顛側頗甚、於是控關鋼線與上舵均爲風吹失維萊乃圖以下舵駕駛、渠乃移向控制機右面司舵、船長則在左面司升高輪、其時船首向上斜約二十度、船身疾落船外除大霧外、毫無所覩、渠問高度幾何、答者以三百呎對、渠乃命船中各人準備不可避免之破壞、各人均甚鎭靜處事、但轉瞬船已着水、海水由窗口湧入、渠急游泳出船、渠至水面時、在不斷之電光中見飛船逐浪而去、船首向天、船身已全毁矣、　乃見福布斯號船燈渠拚命向該船泅去、獲一板、抱之而泅、渠聞水面有呼號聲、福布斯號抛繩下水、曳其登船、但其餘諸人則離福布斯號較遠也、</p>

<h3>禍不單行小飛船又失事</h3>
<p>國民五日萊克赫斯特電　美海軍旣於昨晨沉失大飛船阿克朗號、喪失海軍航空局長莫斐德少將與其他官長十八人、兵士五十四人後、詎料禍不單行、昨日下午復有小飛船　字第三號尋覓阿克朗破船未得、歸途至紐傑賽州海文海灘轉特沃克外半哩許墮海全毁、船中職員兩人立死、三人失蹤、料亦葬身海窟、其餘四人獲　、至阿克朗飛船顯已沉没海底、當初德油輪富布士號首先尋覓嗣美飛機及美巡洋艦波特蘭號與驅逐艦等十餘艘先後馳至、惟迷霧中狂搜冥索、失蹤將士與船身、至於今晨迄無所見、現巳停正搜尋</p>
<h3>美新總統痛悼喪失將材</h3>
<p>是以惡耗旣傳、全國震悼、美總統昨夜徹夜未眠、守候尋覓消息、迨見失蹤諸人巳無拯救希望、乃發宣言稱、此次損失爲國家巨災、飛船雖可重造、而將材難得、深滋痛惜、海軍部兵史漢生亦發宣言、謂莫斐德少將之失蹤、海軍中喪失一元良、</p>
<h3>飛船政策顯受一致命傷</h3>
<p>刻國會議員及公衆對於政府今後應否繼續使用飛船問題、頓分兩派、多數報紙主張應倣照英國例、至少在暫時解散飛船隊、拆卸諸飛船、但另一派則主張應先行詳密調查、方可加以討論、衆議員斐希已在衆院提議組織委員會、詳細調查此事海軍部長史潢生則聲稱、此次誠爲海軍界在承平時空前未有之大慘劇、第欲就此一事以决定政府方針、未免過早、嗣乃保證政府將儘速調查飛船使用問題、惟史氏刻正嚴重考慮應否至少在今後數年内抛棄發展飛船政策、顯然可知云、</p>
<h3>失事原因未可加以臆斷</h3>
<p>國民四日柏林電電　自美國大飛船阿克朗號出事後、德國總統興登堡及總理希特勒均已致電美國總統羅斯福吊唁、而德國航空部長戈林氏亦曾致一唁電於美國海軍部云、德國齊柏林大飛船指揮軍克納氏、對於此次美國大飛船失事曾發表談話稱、現在所接到之消息尚未完全、故失事之究竟原故、亦一時難加以臆斷、但謂因空中雷電交作之故而致失事、則甚難置信、因飛船平時固時時可於雷電交作之中行駛者、至謂因受電流激　之故、亦未能認爲失事之原因、所幸者該飛船司令官韋萊氏得救、韋氏爲航行飛船老手、將來定能據其觀察、以失事實在原因見告世人也、再則阿克朗失事之後、復有美國海軍小號飛船　七號因尋覔海上受難者而亦沉入海中、致船上五人溺死、此種消息傳來、更令人悲慟云　　路透五日紐約電　據阿克朗號飛船遇救之某船員聲稱、當時飛船爲電所繞若然分裂、儼如一蛤、至其原因、仍不能確定、某專家之意、阿克朗之失事、乃因飛於空氣直流中所致、又有一人謂必因飛於烈風之渦旋中而遇禍云、海軍次官聲稱、現將從事關查、以决定輕於空氣之飛行物是否有益於國防、</p>
<h3>無獨有偶法飛船亦遭禍</h3>
<p>國民四日巴黎電　追踪美國大飛船阿克朗號而失事者、復有法國之海軍大飛船Ｅ九號、失事之時間正在美國兩次飛船失事後數小時、該法國飛船今日以機件損壞、不得不在羅希福及羅林兩地之間急劇下降、不意觸地時、竟全體折而爲二、司令及一副官受重傷、其餘十二人則均受輕傷、</p>
<h3>德國覆俄抗議</h3>
<p>措辭異常强硬</p>

<p>國民四日柏林電日前蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫氏因對於蘇俄人民在德所受種種不良待遇、故德國境内蘇俄商務代表辦公處時受德國當局搜查一節、曾提出抗議、兹德國政府對於蘇俄之抗議、已擬就答復、大致謂此種搜查、實因多量可疑文件之發現、以致無可避免、再則德國之内政實不能容許任何鄰邦之干涉云、</p>
<h3>南昌輪英船員被擄案</h3>

<p>任侍從武官長職</p>
<p>華聯社五日東京電　九一八事變禍華兇首本莊繁中將、自上年八月因内部各師長不願服從其命、且因日本對滿政策有所變更、辭去關東軍司令官要職以後、即任軍事參議官閑職、本莊係荒木派之猛將、在積極驅除長州軍閥勢力當中、荒木雖十分設法安揷、而未得空位置、今因日皇侍從武官長奈良大將、因停年去職、即調本莊中將繼任其職、據荒木派聲稱、本莊侵略中國建造﹁滿洲國﹂有功、故有今次之選任、定六日舉行就職禮、</p>
<h3>日本戰爭總動員之準備（二續）</h3>
<p>六總動員與假想敵</p>
<p>國家總動員的計畫以陸海軍的計畫爲目標、所以陸梅軍的計畫一旦有了假想敵國、那麽總動員當然也有假想敵國的、</p>
<p>七動員計畫那一國最進步</p>
<p>這應該屬於那一國呢、這個總動員的計畫就是一種因爲要最大限度的增强國力、而有效的統圖着人的和物的資源總力的任務、所以各國都非常秘密的進行着、因此關於牠的内容、那一國做了一些甚麽、那一國進行到那裏、這是無從知道的、並且把這發表出來、無異於發表自巳的戰法、所以無論那一國都不肯公然發表的、祇從其所公然發表的一部分、和從他方面來觀察、彼此都確實有進行着、但是其中那一國最進步、在歐洲方面最完備的國家大約是意太利、意太利把總動員法當做法律用、法國也是如此、</p>
<p>美國和法國雖然總動員法提出了議會、但是都没有通過、而意大利却通過了議會的、然而在戰爭時最能切實進行的、要算蘇聯、蘇聯的五年計畫重要點在於重工業的製造、並且把五年間的國防充實縮成四年、尤其是無産階級專政到處限制着國民的日常生活、單就衣服方面來說、莫斯科的女子須穿一色的衣服、如是對於國民的生活加以限制、而將所有的金錢都使用在重工業、尤其是國防的施設、其結果戰爭力是最切實的向上着、其内容就是所謂五年計畫、最近又進行着第二次計晝、其平時和戰時無異、所以也可以說是進行着國家總動員、並且其資源豐富、政府又有統制的威力、國民的忍耐力也很强、</p>
<p>蘇聯天然資源之豐富、並且有世界五分之一的領土、人口又有一億六千數百萬、政府又有絶對的統制權、所以其效果是很偉大的、第一次五年計畫縮成四年、這個五年計畫有所期待的百分之幾完全成功着、從一九三三年年初所進行的第二次計畫要投資千四百萬萬盧布或千五百萬萬盧布、只在工業力方面、一九三七年度要較去年增至二萬萬半、從這裏看來我們可以說蘇聯對於總動員是有相當的準備的、</p>
<p>我們再看看世界的情形、在歐洲方面最進步雖說是意大利、但是從實質的總動員的情形看來、蘇聯可以算是最進步的、其實質的戰爭準備方面的國力培養可以算是世界第一的、就是準備最徹底的國家應該要推舉專制政治的國家、那麽日本究竟是怎樣、祇是有一句話要附帶說的、就是紙上空計畫是無濟於事的、像日本這樣資源貧弱工業力貧弱的國家、空計畫是無用的、第一要投資來振興工業力和國力、這就是一種總動員上的平時施設、這個進行到甚麽地步、昭和二年以來的情形怎樣、如果參閱最近年度國家預算就大抵可以分明的、像蘇聯那樣的實質的工業武力是不大進行着、</p>
<p>國家總　員在專制政治的國家最進步、在意大早像墨索里尼那樣、在蘇聯像史達林那樣獨裁政治家存在着的國家、意大利人是具有專制政治黨的國民性、而蘇聯人具有對於專制政治能隠忍久持的國民性、所以總動員纔容易進行的、而日本也産生了强有力政府、國民對於神武天皇建國的精神、皇道的精神也正燃着、一旦戰爭爆發的時候、能耐困苦、貫徹其精神勇往邁進、現在的日本有没有這種自信、是發生問題的、對於總動員雖然有了紙上的計盡、但是如果没有强有力的政府、和國民的思想信念、和一致團結的持久力、那麽總動員也祇有其名而無其實、國家總動員結局也是成爲國體的問題、尤其是思想問題而已、根本上似乎要變成精神總動員的狀態、因此軍部就被誤解爲謳歌專制政治者、這眞没有辦法　　八平時産業的培養</p>
<p>國家總動員在平時不過是一種紙上的計畫、但是如果把紙上的計畫移到平時的施設、以戰時爲目標而舉行施設、這也是在總動員的範圍内、並且總動員計畫並不單以戰時施設的計畫爲目標、而平時産業的培養也要同時顧及的、總動員所必須的調查也不單是爲了戰爭而調查的、並且要把這個調查也用在平時行政方面、所以總動員的調查是具有這兩種目的的、就是說總動員不單是爲了戰時陸海軍而進行的、同是也是有助於平時行政的、要之戰時經濟是和統制經濟相似的、關於轉換爲國有統制的經濟組織、是歸諸總動員一方面的研究的、那就是說按照通常的研究是不行的、例如德國發生戰爭時、發生了有調查國内原料及資源多寡之必要、統計局急於要得到關於此問題的統計、但是得不到甚麽、在統計局必須花費六個月纔得搜集該項的統計、這樣一來是來不及的、最遲在二週間内必須要用、因此當時就命令對於供給軍需品的個人和對於約千個的公司在二週間内舉行了這個調查、但是結果國家總動員的實施總算是遲緩了、</p>
<p>如果紙上的計畫完成了、一旦國家總動員的實際時期到來的時候、就要根據軍需工業法、這種法律在大正七年四月十六日發布的、於是在法律上、國民在戰時必須從事於戰爭、並且政府得徵用能在工廠、事業上工作人員、這就移到工業動員的方面來了、在日本、工業動員法巳經在大正七年就産生的、所以工業動員的準備總算已經從十數年前就進行了的、從此、政府得自由使用工廠、事業所、並且得徵用人員、因此政府就能自由的製造軍需品了、工業動員法中又規定着軍需産業的保護和獎勵、並且細分着二十餘條的法文、因此、總算能在相當廣範圍内、把軍需工業動員活用實施的、（本完）</p>

<p>蚌埠通信、豫當局以年來黄河汎濫、爲水慮之源、擬由建設廳會同水災會導黄入淮、南入長江、但皖人羣起反對、聲浪甚高、而居於淮河流域之皖北人士、反對尤烈、龔心湛·王揖唐·王普等、除函懇皖主席吳忠信、力謀挽回外、近又致書各同鄉、請一致作有力主張、其反對理由、大意謂﹁自元明以來、黄水奪淮水入海之口、淮水被逼而入江、迨黄水復歸於北、而淮水入海之口、淤沙高仰、入海之路遂絶、全淮受病、而江之下游亦病、加以川陜各區、山田廣闊、淤沙碎石、悉入江流、而輪船來往如梭、傾棄煤渣、日積月累、於是江底日淺、江洲日闊、江面亦遂日狹、而上游洞庭·鄱陽·諸湖、向之分洩長江巨流者、今則淤塞殆半、每值江漲之時、沿江圩田、掃蕩一空、而城鎭受害尤鉅、前歲之災、漢埠幾致陸沉、蕪湖街市行舟、而國都重地下關、汪洋幾遍、即城市較低之街巷、聞亦以船筏濟人、憂時之士、惕然遠慮、遂有疏濬長江之議、實則工費太鉅、無從着手、較之導淮入海、尤爲願大難償、今此禍尚無策消除、而又將黄水引入皖淮、以達於江、竊計淤沙奔注、十倍從前、天塹之區、將成溝瀆東南財賦之邦、沿江根本之地、是何景象、可想而知、自國都南遷、所賴以控制北方者、恃有津浦鐵路、徐州扼津浦之中樞、控隴海之要　、縱横四達、形勢尤雄、然鐵路由徐而南、跨淮水南北兩岸、此二三百里間、地勢平衍、昔年淮水漲發之時、僅餘一線軌道、浮於上面、車行其上、如聯颿之越滄海、固已岌岌可危、若再加一滔天之黄水、則湍激浩瀚、軌道必致全淹、咫尺徐方、已有望洋之歎、至燕齊各省、陜洛要區、與國都之聲勢、何所資以聯絡、興言及此、實覺不寒而慄、而洪流奔注、淮揚裏下河一帶、皆成釜底、近畿千里、流亡萃集、南北隔閡、其何以堪﹂云云、（四月三日）</p>
<h3>鎭江各業蕭條情况</h3>
<p>鎭江通訊、蘇省自二十年間受江北水患影響後、繼以二十一年春問滬戰、致省會所在地之鎭江、各業日趨蕭條、兹將其現狀摘要述後、</p>
<p>綢布往年營業發達異常、近因社會濟經枯竭、人民購買力弱、光顧者少、各店雖裝置無線電收音機、藉以號召顧客、而效果幾等於零、於是綢布洋貨等業、祇得出之於減價拍賣之一途、</p>
<p>金業　自標金大漲、兌換者多、購金者少、各店乃以代製證章銀盾等爲隋帶營業、惟貨價甚巨、非資本雄厚者、不足以應付、</p>
<p>錢業　本年實施廢兩改元、加以賬面極少、洋釐等價、每日無大出入、不過維持殘局而已、</p>
<p>雜貨　　全恃外埠來批客貨、刻因裏下河各地、收成减色、故批發客貨者、已較往歲减去十之四五、</p>
<p>航業　除原有九公司外、新公司風起雲湧、互爭營業、前途大有破産之虞、</p>
<p>米業　去歲榖賤、米商呌苦、今春亦未見起色、如米市恢復、或有復興之望、</p>
<p>運輸　因受各業不振之影響、運輸者較少、小公司呌苦不迭、大公司虧息不貲　　紙業　金鎊雖標金大漲、進貨以洋位抵金價、故暗損甚巨、</p>
<p>磁器　因江西來貨不湧、售出又未便漲價、致營業亦感冷落、（四月五日）</p>
<p>松江</p>

<h3>襪業凋敝請求救濟</h3>
<p>本邑襪廠一業、全縣共有七十餘家、營業之盛貨品之精、爲内地各縣冠、詎本年自交春以後、市面凋敝、營業一落千丈、現在存貨山積、銷路全無、各廠以放出賬欵、因社會經濟艱窘、收取爲難、而逐日生産、又無銷路、以致周轉不靈、紛紛停業、昨經同業公會議决、請各廠勉力維持、以期共濟時艱、一面函請商會轉呈黨政兩方、請求救濟、以資維持、</p>
<h3>各區不得征收附稅</h3>
<p>省政府近以各縣區公所、往往直接征收附稅、如筵席户籍等捐、逕作區公所經費、實歷紊亂財政系統、昨特訓令各縣嚴行取締、以後各區公所、不得直接征收附稅、</p>

<h3>財部電令今日起實行廢兩改元</h3>
<p>從此銀兩交易不生法律效力</p>
<p>銀錢兩業昨均召集緊急會議</p>
<p>自三月十日起、各業交易、一律改用洋本位後、財政部昨日電滬、自今日起、所有公私欵項及一切交易、須一律改用銀幣、不得再用銀兩、銀錢業奉令後、當即分别召開緊急會議、討論辦法、兹誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>（財政部電）交易所監理員·市商會·市銀行業同業公會·錢業同業公會鑒、本部定四月六日起、所有公私欵項、及一切交易、須一律改用銀幣、不得再用銀兩、凡是日以前、原訂以銀兩爲收付者、在上海應以規元七錢一分五釐折合銀幣一元爲標準、槪以銀幣收付、如在上海以外各地方、應按四月五日、由匯兌行市先行折合規元、再以規元折合銀幣、其在是日以後新立契約票據與公私欵項之收付、及一切交易而仍用銀兩者、在法律上爲無效、至持有銀兩者、得依照銀本位幣鑄造條例之規定、請求中央造幣廠代鑄銀幣、或送交就地中央·中國·交通·三銀行兌換銀幣行使、以資便利、除布告并分行外、合亟電知、并仰轉行遵照、財政部歌、</p>

<h3>伍朝樞談抗日抵貨效力較勝軍事</h3>
<p>我國經濟組織散漫戰時優於日本</p>
<p>對日直接交涉非不可爲乃不可能</p>
<p>不長司法願盡力直接有關國難者</p>
<p>新聲社記者於昨日上午往訪中委伍朝樞氏、與談各種問題、所論頗詳、兹特分紀於下、</p>
<h3>以長制短</h3>
<p>據伍氏云、中國在此時期、軍事爲重、外交次之、但有一利器、其力量效用、實與軍事同一重要、或且較勝於軍事、惜猶未能善自運用耳、其事惟何、即經濟是也、蓋我國經濟雖無組織、然仍保持固有之農村社會經濟狀况、故甲地發生一問題、其餘各地、雖難免蒙受影響、但决不致牽動全局、唯其如是、故在經濟上與日本比較、實我優於彼、而常能保持各個經濟獨立之精神、日本在經濟中爲有組織之國家、唯其有組織、常見其一地發生問題、動輒牽制全局、是以在平時我國經濟之無組織、實爲一大缺點、但在此多難之秋、正足以見其長、故以比較而言、在軍事上之設備、我與日較、相差甚遠、惟在經濟上則我長彼短、國人當知己知彼、運用自己之長、以制彼之短、運用之法唯何、即實行抵貨、予以經濟制裁、蓋日貨之輸入我國、猶坦克車飛機之在喜峯口石門寨、其爲害實尤烈、今國人倡言爲國家軍事後盾、本人認爲捨此實無第二法、較之空言救國、相去何止千里、不見乎德國之排猶乎、命令朝發而夕至、舉國一致、其精神何等整齊、此固其組織交通完備、但在我國、當由國人自動、始克有濟、蓋即由政府領導、而人民漠然不動、又何益乎、余有友已數十年不用日貨、其原因雖未明、但國人如入人有此精神、則必可制日以死命也、</p>
<h3>直接交涉</h3>
<p>至於直接交涉、國際兩國往來、莫不直接交涉、中國與日本何嘗不可直接交涉、但現在日本與中國之情勢、因一直接交涉、日本必要求承認僞組織、及種種非法之要求、則又有何交涉可言、簡言之、非直接交涉之不可以、實係直接交涉之不可能、至國聯二十二國顧問委員會之進展如何、現尚未可預料、惟此會之設、亦不過視全局轉移如何而定其應付之方針也</p>
<h3>委任統治</h3>
<p>德美之要求日本歸還南洋委治權、現雖略趨沉寂、但將來必仍有解决之一日、蓋以現在情形觀之、似尚祇德美兩國、惟英國因澳洲南洋之關係、將來亦必起而過問此事、現德國因排猶問題、較嚴重於此事、故暫時無積極態度、一俟排猶解决、則必從而解决此問題、至其結果如何、現實難說、惟如意相墨索里尼之四强公約成功、則解决必甚易易也、</p>
<h3>不就法長</h3>
<p>又謂中央請本人出任司法部長、此事在京時雖曾聞有是說、本人實未同意、且已正式辭謝、或謂在此時期、大家應共赴國難、惟本人此後必與國難直接有關者、願盡其力也、又外交委員長一席當本人前次出席外交委員會時、即巳聲明不就、僅允任臨時主席而已、近頗有人作書於予、直接書外交委員長者實屬誤會也、</p>
<h3>鐵部圈用地停止買賣令先行布告取銷</h3>
<p>鐵部以京滬滬杭甬兩路、擬圈用眞茹彭浦江灣三區民地改建客運聯運總站及臨時車站之舉、决暫緩進行、所有對於收用各地段、停止賣買之令、先行布告取銷、俟車站問題賡續進行時、再布告收用、</p>

<p>碼頭保護江天靠金利源碼頭、本埠華租兩當局、均派有警探駐守等候、迨後水上有水巡隊·陸上有法捕房·公安局·偵緝隊·船上仍由押護前來之憲兵負責、靠碼頭之一段馬路、仍與上次同樣阻斷行人、保護異常嚴密、迨開始搬運後、每一汽車上有越捕一·公安局偵緝員一·及博物院職員一人、會同押運、由江天輪運滬、計分裝前後上下四艙、門窗皆有行政院封條黏貼、頗爲審愼　　古物類别昨到滬古物、共三千九百二十二箱、中有北平古物陳列館古物八百十四箱屬圖書、平市頤和園古物七十四箱農銅玉器、故宫博物院之三千零三十四箱、此中物品類别、大抵屬於圖畫者四百七十七箱、屬銅磁玉器者五百九十三箱、文獻擋案一千二百四十箱、屬故宫博物院秘書處管轄有六百餘箱、其他槓杖等品、因未能成箱、打就長包、共計六十二件、</p>
<p>程秘書談記者至天主堂街該庫棧、晤押運來滬之博物院秘書程星齡、其時上次押運來滬之該院總務處長俞同奎亦在座、當由程氏發表談話、略謂、今日所到共三九二二箱、惟其中有古物陳列館及頤和園附帶南來之古物、至第四批古物南運與留平、古物尚有若干箱、因爲平方尚在準備中、實無從置答、總之、博物院仍本原有辦法、繼續裝箱、一俟令到、立刻啓運、到職員方面、因平滬仍需人照料、未如外傳有大舉裁員之事、一切可謂照舊辦事、現在甫經到滬之古物、俟明日（即今日）起運完畢、再經一度點騐箱數、加貼封條後、即算　事、第三批到者、今儲存六樓後、連前兩次到滬爲數頗多查第一批、計一千零六十四箱、第二批三千六百零八箱、第三批三千九百二十二箱、總共八千五百九十五箱云、</p>

<p>（演詞誌要）王曉籍云、普通人常說解决生活問題、現在中國人所要解决的、乃是死活問題、希望同人極力徵求、達到二百萬數目、完成航空救國的目的、史量才謂、上海人住在上海爲在天堂、但想起長城各口之同胞、受焚殺之慘禍、與夫戰士之犧牲性命、挨受苦餓、則豈無惻隠之心、故望滬市各界、不要觀望、踴躍參加、同時希望同人辦理航空、須有敬事而信之觀念、冠生園鄭杏圃云、救國如救火、如隣家失火、未有不拚命爭救的、中國地大物博、如能大家團結一致、决可以解救國難、各隊長都是上海民衆領袖、辦理航空建設、應如救火、如打仗、在前敵打仗須拚命、現在只須勸告同胞入會、何等輕而易舉也、演說畢、已五時半、卽宣告散會、</p>

<h3>如何解决失業的痛苦？</h3>
<p>丨本埠葉資槎君來信丨</p>
<p>我確信貴欄是海船裏的指南針一般、能從迷惘中指示我們的前途。不過半年來讀的百多件通訊，對於我個人所感受的痛苦丨丨也許不絶對只我個人，终未怎樣的解除了去。雖則推類比擬，共同處也經得到不少敎益。先生不怕討厭嗎？在這裏，擬請指示我脫離這歧途的彷徨。我是在﹁希望﹂，﹁期待﹂中消失了靑春的了！流浪生活，佔了我廿多歲的一半光陰，近且三年未回家鄉了。這三年中丨丨脫離學生生活以後，鬼混而已！漫道壯志難酬，簡直完全在流離顛沛中。歲月逝矣，人生幾何！此衷耿耿，能不惘然！尤其是非木石之心，念及久别了的父母弟妹妻子、傷感别離，悵望前途，不禁腸欲斷喲！失業之下，生活情况，不言可知！非但買書無錢，報資亦數月未付，甚至炊斷以大餅充飢，己爲常事。可是這又自己都不相信，﹁生來骨賤，命主吃苦﹂罷，窮，困，我却不當做一回事。我認爲窮，困，確是人生的藝術底着色；與惡環境奮鬥便是人生。窮，困决不會令我煩悶；我也能摒绝外界一切的引誘，自己信任環境的洪爐要把我冶練成有用的器皿。所以順所好丨丨好的是文學，先生不要笑我太不自量吧丨丨孜孜求進，彌窮困而志趣彌毅堅。我也不悲觀；﹁非長處窮困者﹂，别人這樣稱許，自己確亦慰如。過去：中小學敎員丨體育，科員，書記都嘗試過了，服務道德，博到一聲﹁好﹂的。而生成言呐性魯，交際逢迎，實屬不來事。生爲鄉農子，處在這一切需要﹁超越的﹂應付底現狀社會，所以我也自認庸懦寗願失業的了丨還請不要笑我自甘墮落。現在，我所要求指敎的就是：（一）自己明白，現實的不良是過去了的錯誤之果，絶不懊悔。人情世故也參透了三分。我想：我頂適當到故鄉去做個紳士丨丨這也是我的父母唯一的希望；讀書取得文憑做紳士去，也就是我的故鄉讀書的人唯一目的。但是；偏偏我的願望否是這樣，而且已到了這時候，對人對己都太失望。同時；十年流浪依然故我，虚榮（？）使我總覺得覥顔！歸？留？（二）我認爲人之來﹁生﹂决不是爲了﹁死﹂；﹁人生﹂，應當留點痕跡。﹁不負人生﹂，如我的才，能，順我的志趣努力，會不會﹁等於自殺﹂？（三）我覺得﹁我的時間﹂是日見短促了！眞的一分一秒都痛惜虚過丨丨這自然放到﹁所好﹂與幻想上，但；有時覺得無謂：﹁何苦！人生幾何，得過且過﹂丨這矛盾的心情，與﹁我努力下去，是不是可能不負我之所期呢﹂？總是决斷不下。（四）當然啦！﹁寗願失業﹂是事實士不許可的！我一面要求職業，一面利用空閑的時間努力我底﹁所好﹂但是；能過苦的生活，不能過不喫飯不穿衣裳的生活。是否也有可能經濟上得些補助的方法，是我維持目前生活的方法呢？</p>
<p>答：來信稱譽本欄﹁是海船裏的指南針﹂，我們只有慚愧丨又說，你﹁半年讀﹂了本欄﹁百多件通訊﹂對於你﹁個人所感受的痛苦丨也許不只是我個人終未怎樣的解除了去﹂，我們也只有慚愧，然而不能盡怪他們，因爲本欄的責任只在於根據理論與經騐，對於讀者大衆所提出之問題，買其一得之愚，聊供參考或藉資討論。關於讀者大衆許多失業問題，所能爲力者亦只如是，我們不是慈善家，不是賬務處，不是工廠，不是職業介紹所，更不能像那千手千眼的觀世音，一滴楊枝，便可普渡衆生；也不能像聖經上所傳說的上帝可以以一個饅頭飽幾千人。後者固屬空想，前者也非根本解决方法，只是頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚罷了。我們不惟不能，亦且不願，此應奉告足下者一。</p>
<p>足下來信滿紙空論，而且思想混亂異常。這大槪由於足下的境遇艱難所致。你所最要緊的話，就是：怎樣在現在失業的當口，能以得到經濟上的幫助，維持目前的生活，我們没有别的﹁方法﹂，無已，只有請你直接寫一履歷，技能，直接寄給本報﹁自我職業介紹﹂欄，登報招徠雇主。依記者個人看來，你旣﹁生爲鄉農子﹂，最好還是還到鄉裏去做個農民，却絶不要做﹁紳士﹂，不但不要做紳士，並且要與他立反對地位，帮着窮苦的農民做實際的生活鬥爭，聯合大衆，努力解决農村根本問題丨首先就是土地問題。你不是說：﹁人生應當留點痕跡﹂麽？那你也只有回到鄉裏去憑你的知識，影響農民大衆，這便是你唯一的﹁留痕迹﹂的辦法。你留在城市裏丨這人山人海的城市裏，恐怕終於﹁鬼混﹂而巳。而且我看你的文字也不大行，思想也不淸楚，最好在你還末﹁餓死﹂之前，到我們申報流通圖書館讀讀書，或許你的志趣漸漸不同，也未可知丨此應奉告足下者二。</p>

<h3>參觀交大工鐵展覽會後之感想（超觀）</h3>
<p>交通大學工鐵展覧會開幕已六日、參觀者日以散萬計、記者昨亦驅車前往、游覽一週、　觸甚多、略述數　、以爲尚未前往參觀者告、</p>
<p>該會内容以工業展覽爲最要部分、而參加踈列工廠、實以西商爲最多數、佈置　皇、蔚爲大觀、國貨製造廠家、除新中·益中·華生·元豐等數家外、所占地位有限、陳列品亦寥寥無幾、不易引起觀衆之注意、因思滬上國貨工廠、無慮千百、多未能揮斥巨欵、爲廣告宣傳之用、以與外人爭一日之短長、致令外貨充斥、令人發生喧賓奪主之想、未免可慨、此其一、</p>
<p>開幕以後、參觀者甚擁擠、記者厠身其中、魚貫出入、走馬看　、對於各項圖表、多未能駐足瀏覽、殊以爲憾、據該校某君談及、黎校長意在開通民智、希望因展覽會引起羣衆好學之心、故對於觀衆、不欲加以限制、言雖具有至理、而記者終以游人過多、未能暢覽爲恨、此其二、</p>
<p>會塲陳列、對於近代發明之新器物、如電報·電梯·無線電·自動電話·機車·飛機·探海燈·印刷機·以及製釘織襪等機、無一不備、且大半均可由管理人隨時表演、舉一般民衆平素所視爲神奇莫測者、一一均指示詳盡、此其敎育力量之偉大、殆非任何方法所可倫比、吾人未能出洋游歷者、一入其内、無異到歐美之繁盛都市、不能不自幸其眼福之非淺、此其三、</p>
<p>該會所陳列者、尤以工程及鐵道方面爲最豐富、如鐵道公路河工之材料及模型、機棫製造需要之鋼鐵五金及油漆、電機工程應用之馬達無線電等、出品者不止一家左陳列者不止一處不但可供學生之觀摩與研究而各項專家欲得新智議或新見聞者、亦有按圖索驥、左右逢源之樂、鄙見該會似宜規定時間、招待專家參觀、俾得共同討論研究、其效益當更大、此其四、</p>
<p>吾國中小學設備多未完善、恒有讀理科課本十年、而未獲一見簡單儀器者、該校在展覽期間、各試騐室一律開放、陳列儀器標識顯明、足供參考、而廠家展覽品、其足以表示科學之效用、與書本相印證者尤多不可枚舉、殊足　引起靑年學生對於科學之興趣、而促成其好學深思之習慣、此其五、</p>
<p>國内工業、方在萌芽、借助他山、實爲當務之急、會内外國陳列出品、新奇精巧者甚多、製造家如能悉心考察、大足爲改良出品之一助、而有志工業者、亦可發見無數新品物、爲研究試造之資、鄙意卜次開會、似擬擴充範圍、加入冶金化學各項工業、則其陳列品類當更繁當、而比較觀摩之機會亦更多、此其六、</p>
<p>竊以爲展覽會本爲發展文化所必需、外國都市恒每年舉行十餘種之多、吾國方急謀建設、關係尤重似宜由政府及各省市時常輪流舉行、使各地人士均有參觀機會、藉以引起其對於工業之興趣、而工商各界、尤宜積極參加、使技術因觀摩而改進、銷路因宣傳而激增、其裨益社會物質文明之進步、定非淺鮮也、</p>

<h3>大刀出鋒頭</h3>
<p>— 瞻盧</p>
<p>自從宋哲元軍長在喜峯口挫敵，大刀隊大出其鋒頭；最近，廣州市學界抗日聯合會提議事欵購置大刀二千柄，封寄前方勇敢抗日將士使用，以備斬盡仇頭。俗語說的：﹁寶劍贈與烈士，﹂正是這般的用意。</p>
<p>日本自稱是製造名刀的國度，考查他們談刀劍的書籍，如﹁軍器考﹂，﹁刀劍錄﹂，﹁古刀銘鑑﹂，﹁刀劍秘寶﹂都把倭刀說得和干將莫邪一般；但，在喜峯口偏偏失風，有一個隊長執着家傳的日本刀陷陣，依舊戰敗而死；、日本刀怎麽這般的没用呢？</p>
<p>松岡洋右出席日内瓦的時候，盛傳他的母親，賜給他一柄寶刀，吩咐他努力折衝；要是，外交失敗，便該伏刀而死。現在呢，日本的外交大失敗，已成爲不可掩的事實了；松岡這番回國，大槪要把這柄刀交還他的母親，道兩句：﹁寶刀奉璧，恕不自刎。﹂</p>
<p>同是關於刀的事實，廣州學生的贈刀，情緒何等熱烈？松岡洋右的繳刀，意興何等頽唐？日本刀的名譽，從此一落千丈了！</p>
<p>說什麽籠手切？不及宋軍三尺鐵；誇什麽斷六股？不及宋軍大刀與闊斧。</p>
<p>註丨東洋載籍中誇談倭刀的鋒利，據稱；有人提刀砍敵，中臂鎧，應手而斷；遂名此刀爲籠手切﹂，籠手便是臂鎧的别名。又有人手提倭刀，往殺羣盜，順手一揮，竟把三個强盜的股，一齊斬斷，遂名此刀爲﹁六股﹂。</p>
<h3>飛機與大刀</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>說起了日本的飛機，俺就不由得心驚肉跳。一二八之役，俺就親眼瞧見過。大蜻蜓兒在屋頂上打了幾個轉，屁股一蹲，昻着頭去了。說時遲，那時快，就在屁股一蹲，頭一昻的當兒，炸彈着地，轟通一聲，屋子上濃烟直冒。同時，下面發出幾響步槍聲，疎疎落落，淸淸脆脆，表示着日本人的膿包，俺民族英雄，兀是挺着脖子，在這兒沉着應戰。但是上天無路，入地無門，而蜷伏在屋子裏的難民同志，死了没資格車送騐屍所的，正不知究竟是幾千幾百幾十幾位。有一位隔岸觀火的洋大人說，﹁飛機那傢伙，惟一的妙用，就在乎轟炸無辜的平民﹂。這位洋大人，是否是蕭伯訥老太爺的黨羽，專愛陰陽怪氣地說話，俺可不知道，可是飛機的妙用，就不過如此這麽般而已，無論如何，百分之×××，是不錯的。</p>
<p>有如此妙用的飛機，洋大人也覺得有些心驚肉跳，於是說夢話般的限制一等那莫温的大國，不許有五百零一架。慚愧得甚麽似的，俺無組織的國家，也准予備一百架點綴點綴。中國國土這麽大，洋大人只賞臉一百架，眼看着中國是没希望到東京去屁股一蹲，頭一昻，去出一口烏氣的了。但是我倒不這麽想，俺有的是大刀。俺會把大刀砍得人家喊爸都來不及。飛機只會轟炸無辜平民，俺大刀隊專砍武裝的敵寇。飛機扔炸彈，扔了就完了，俺大刀砍斷了，還可以陳列。飛機多了，受人限制，大刀儘多不打緊。俺總有一天用大刀收復失地，踏平三島，到那時纔漏臉哪。您瞧着罷</p>
<h3>介紹幾句外國話</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>丨給國人們聽丨</p>
<p>外國人素來瞧不起我們中國人，外交方面所感受着的恥辱，那是盡人皆知，無須贅述，我却要把外國人和中國人友誼方面的談話，表面上似乎輕描淡寫，骨子裏含着諷剌性的，介紹給國人們聽聽。</p>
<p>我友袁纘之君，他留學美國康乃爾大學，在某工廠實習，那時廠中有個美國人，和他很相契合，工作餘暇，總是和他到附近的咖嗎店去坐一會，喝一會；或是到空曠的所在去散散步，有時還作學術方面的討論，那美國人得意極了，說：像你這樣的中國人眞夠得上資格啊丨我友聽了這句話，覺的很剌耳，似乎中國人都是非文明非優秀的分子，那是多麽輕蔑啊！當時就回答他說：那不見得吧！因爲像我這樣的人，在中國人中是極尋常的一個。</p>
<p>這事距今已多年了。那時美國的孟祿博士，問禮來華，他素慕我們蘇州的文物，所以曾來領略一回虎阜靈巖玄妙觀獅子林的勝蹟。蘇州學界中人，就奉陪他到處游覽。他瞧見我們舊式的蠣殻牕線裝的古書，没有樓的大厦，他都讚美的了不得說：貴國旣有這樣的好東西，美制式：何以要捨此從人呢？臨了他在某茶寮中喝茶憇息，瞧見座客們都是談笑風生，從容不迫的態度。他很詫異道：貴國人好大的閒福，若在敝國是求之不得的。唉丨無業游民，充斥於國，國家那裏能夠發展光大呢！</p>
<p>昨天黄紹裘君和我談，他有個英國朋友，第一次到中國的上海。他在通衢間，聽到各商舗門前裝着無線電的歌唱，一支連一支的很是熱閙。他就對黄君說：你們貴國人都是樂天派，眞會尋快活啊！﹁商女不知亡國恨，隔江猶唱後庭花﹂，這大槪可以說是娱樂不忘救國，救國不忘娱樂吧。</p>

<p>江氏走到外邊堂屋裏，向裏面屋子裏一探頭，笑道：老太爺，你們爺兒倆眞好丨看起來不像爺兒倆，倒像·········說着，突然將話頓住，老太爺見他手上捧了兩隻大蘿葡，便起身迎道：老太，什麽事？送我們蘿葡吃嗎？江氏道：剛才聽到連長說，要買蘿葡，又怕買了凍心的。我家倒有十幾斤好蘿葡，送老太爺兩個罷，趙自强聽說，口裏道着謝，將蘿葡接過去。趙翁道：我爺兒倆正誇獎您的大姑娘呢？江氏笑道：可不是嗎？不瞞你說，我們是六親無靠，要不是這個孩子還稱心，我還活着有什麽意思，他雖是没有本事，心眼兒倒不錯，他瞧見趙連長買鷄買肉孝敬老太爺，心裏只找急，說是也要買肉煨點湯我喝。我說那用不着，只要他有這番心就得了。趙翁笑道：别站着說呀，坐一會去呀。江氏道：不坐了，我娘兒倆還趕着要跟人做一件棉袍子呢。說畢，笑嘻嘻的去了。趙自强向趙翁道：這位大姑娘很不錯，還知道買肉煨湯他母親吃，咱們多謝人家送了兩個蘿葡，回頭湯煑得了，咱們也送他家一碗，您看好不好？趙翁點頭道：好的。就憑他說一輩子不嫁，要養娘一層，這就呌咱們當帮帮人家忙。可是養娘儘管養娘，出閣儘管出閣，這是兩件事，趙自强道：雖說是兩件事，究竟是一件事，姑娘出了門子，遇事都要聽婆婆家的了，還抽得出工夫來養娘嗎？趙翁道：怎麽不能呢？挑那個懂事的人家······趙自强笑着又搖搖頭道：剛才我倒說您老人家思想新，現在我又要說您思想舊了。這年頭兒的婚姻，第一個條件，就是彼此要有愛情。</p>

<h3>啟口運動</h3>
<p>— 許晚成</p>
<p>中國人的口，本來是半封半啟的，可說是半開門户！</p>
<p>大家不願說話，不敢說話爲什麽呢？恐不利於己，或遭人非議，或被乂乂禁止。﹁今夕只可談風月，免生是非，﹂大家如此想！</p>
<p>其實不但中國人的口是半封半啟，卽全世界人類的口，也都半開門户呀！有事實爲證！</p>
<p>日本無理侵攻破壞全人類的非戰公約，但有誰啟口痛斥？不過吞吞吐吐，斷氣似的說幾句。</p>
<p>人類是需要﹁啟口運動﹂呀！有什麽說什麽，不隠不瞞，言行一致，那末人類才有安寗的一天了。</p>

<h3>學生軍（上）</h3>
<p>— 任予</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>太陽才從操塲的東邊，攢出了些些的光。高大的禮堂和敎室宿舍，幾儀建築物，都涭在還没散盡的濃霧喪，一切都是靜的，呆的；和開登的冷面一樣。</p>
<p>老陳，拿了一塊布很有勁兒擦了幾下他的新伙伴，！黄銅的軍饕，使它一百二十分的光亮，在隊裏夠稱得起一聲漂亮。一回兒，很興奮底吹了幾下：</p>
<p>﹁搭···的搭的搭···的搭···的···﹂</p>
<p>他鼓足了他的吃奶力，使頭上的靑筋，粗粗的跑了起來，臉也漲紅了，但，</p>
<p>﹁他媽的！眞難侍候它！輕了不響！重了又不響！你這傢伙！﹂</p>
<p>雖然，很抱恨，但，爲了某一方面，也祗能抱了它向他的臥室走去。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>在幾年前某一椿國恥發生以後。</p>
<p>酣睡着的民衆忽然驚醒了。各界紛紛去幹他們的新工作：開會，演講，發宣言。我們﹁國家的柱石﹂！學生，豈肯後人，也響應起來，成立學生軍。</p>
<p>老陳是我們校裏的大人物。他憑他的魄力佔了本校學生會的主席，並且很安心：每年總没會不派司，雖然他肚子裏儘是一包稻草。現在更容易的在他意想中的，得了學生軍籌備員的資格。</p>
<p>第一步，先發出一張佈告：</p>
<p>﹁外侮日亟······武裝起來······每入須繳制服費洋二十元量製之一切手續槪由本籌備員代備············</p>
<p>學生軍籌備員陳乂乂﹂</p>
<p>接着，由他靈活的外交手段，和校長辦了一次交涉。結果：﹁停課三天籌備學生軍之一切事宜﹂。他興冲冲地走進了閱報室，翻遍了電影院的廣告。想：</p>
<p>﹁該瞧瞧今天北京裏開映的什麽？﹂</p>
<p>··················</p>
<p>三天的紛擾：繳費，量制服，量脚做皮靴子。</p>
<p>又過二星期。全校學生軍都穿着二十塊錢買來的一套灰布制服和一雙小牛皮靴子，上操塲開始訓練起來。老陳却自己擔任了軍號。據說：﹁一軍的軍號是全軍兵士的靈魂：能使敵人喪膽，能使我們努力衝鋒，能使······啊！眞是，啊！最重要的一個！﹂其實，號兵和其他比較起來，旣是少幾次上操；並且在靜寂的早晨，這樣：﹁搭的搭的搭﹂吹幾下，使同學們在睡夢喪驚醒過來，必定在想：</p>
<p>﹁啊！夠努力！多冷多早的天，已在訓練他的號子了﹂</p>
<p>不是很容易在人家的腦海裏，印上一個好現象？</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>特地從乂乂軍校請來的一個軍事訓練員孫先生也到校了。孫先生雖是湖北人，但一個矮矮的瘦瘦的身材，很没有夠威武的樣子。丨嗄！不不！這好一付短小精悍的身材，在戰地上很需要的。還有，額上毛茸茸的短髮，並不跟其他的長髮向後倒下去，兀是巓巍巍地挺立着。還有，大眼鏡，粉紅色桿兒的自來墨水筆。還有，圓形和鐘形的徽章丁丁的打着，在走路的時候。和人家養的小哈叭狗一樣。</p>

<h3>兒童與國貨</h3>
<p>— 潘仰芬</p>
<p>蒙台梭利，是一個兒童敎育的專家：她說：﹁敎育最大的力量，是習慣兩個字，養成兒童最良的習慣，要從建設善良環境入手。﹂現在提倡國貨人人都知道，人人都熱心，可是小朋友的習慣還没有養成，小朋友樂用國貨的環境，還没有建設。</p>
<p>杜威夫人說：﹁敎育兒童最大的效力，在利用機會，使兒童隨時參加進去，不知不覺間使他養成一種不得不然的習慣。﹂現在提倡國貨人人都知道，人人都熱心，可是小朋友的機會還没有利用，小朋友參加國貨運動的機會，還没有嘗試。</p>
<p>我前年到大連，恰好日本人在那裏開兒童用品展覽會。會中出品，有服裝，有玩具，有臥具，有食具，有文具，有衛生用具没有一件是舶來品，一針一線，一紙一片，都是本國的原料，本國的製作品，參加的兒童，每天有一二千人，有敎師督率的，有父母帶領的，會中有文字的宣傳，有專員的說明，有女子的招待，興高采烈，舉市若狂，吾歸來後大大的贊歎，以爲﹁十年生聚十年敎訓﹂這句話，倒被日人學乖了。可是中國人實在不爭氣，年年有兒童節，不過開關會，做幾篇文章，點綴熱閙罷了，有什麽實效可收呢？恭喜得很，在這國貨年中的兒童節，居然比前大大不同了。中國國貨公司有兒童游樂市的舉辦，上海國貨公司有兒童樂園的設置，可喜可賀，兒童的幸福來了，因爲兒童是國民的源泉，兒童有幸福，便是國家的幸福，社會的幸福。要救國，要强種，須從培養兒童入手。要使兒童有善良習慣，必從兒童樂用國貨入手。要使兒童有參加愛國機會，必從兒童樂用國貨入手。中國國貨公司等能搜羅兒童應用的各種國貨用品用科學方法來陳列，供給小朋友游樂和採購。國貨公司肯爲小朋友服務，可算是破天荒的美舉。國貨公司肯鼓勵小朋友愛國，可算是破天荒的盛事。我參觀以下覺許多小朋友都是有聲有色，活潑潑地。這種基礎工作是值得頌揚，值得紀念。吾希望小朋友趁這春假之中來踴躍參加熱心提倡。希望疼愛兒童的父母們和許多小學裏的敎師們，快快帶領小朋友來參加，把個個小朋友，都願和國貨爲友。完成這國貨年的使命。</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3>國貨工廠内部組織應有的連鎖性</h3>
<p>— 周成勛</p>
<p>在生産落後經濟衰頽的目下國貨事業·當前的急務·是切實需要健全的堅實的内部連鎖組織，然後才可以談到聯合同業抵制舶來這一套大名詞，我們試一念及洋貨充斥的市塲景象，再一念及同業傾軋供應失宜的國貨界不景氣時，不禁毛髮悚然，替國貨前途抱有莫大的隠憂。</p>
<p>所謂﹁健全的堅實的内部連鎖組織﹂，並不是一句虚浮的表面的高調，而是我們日處國貨工廠中身歷其境感到必要的結論，我們要迅速排除工廠内部業務上隔膜不相關的缺點，而很希望蒸蒸日上，安内對外，所以舉出下面幾點關於一個工廠的營業製造二方面應有連鎖的貫通，來和諸君商討：</p>
<p>甲·營業方面對製造方面；</p>
<p>子，市塲需要的急速報告某種貨品在市面上有着廣博的銷路，營業方面應立即將詳細情形報告給製造方面，並催促趕造·以應市銷，這樣就可不落人後。</p>
<p>丑·呆滯貨品的覓找出路一個工廠往往有許多呆貨頓積在棧裏的，與其這樣虚擱時日，倒不如趕快找尋出路，相機脫售，就是降低一些售價，但可以活動金融也是值得的，所以營業方面應負起這個責任。</p>
<p>寅·工作程序的完全了解營業人員能夠申叙貨品的製作情形，可以使外界有圓滿的了解，尤其是定貨，要估計得出交貨時日，那末如期交貨，不損信用。</p>
<p>卯·外界批評的忠實通知外界對本廠貨品有公正的批判，或是善意的指導，營業方面應該虚心接受，忠實的通知製造方面，有所改革。</p>
<p>乙，製造方面　營業方面，</p>
<p>子·繁銷貨品的充分準備有一部份貨品是長年有着去路的，應該有充分的貯積，以期保住營業額而减少缺貨的損失。</p>
<p>丑·新頴花式的層見疊出營業也許因了天時地理或民情的原故·有一個時期的淸淡，這時候必得有新出品新花式來調劑補充，那末可以新奇購買者的耳目，彌補淸淡的營業，但在平時，也該時常製出新出品，在市塲裏先估優勢。</p>
<p>寅·裝配包紥的迅速堅固貨品打了箱子，紮了件頭，陸川裝運，一定震動得利害，製造方面能督促工人裝配的堅固，避免損傷短少，這一定可以博外界信任的榮譽，而且迅速敏快，隨添隨有，也足促進外界美好的批評，這對於營業十分有關係。</p>
<p>卯，存貨數量的準確報告　把存貨的數量，分門别類精確的隨時報告給營業方面，督策營業人員便宜行事，减少存貨過多過少的缺點。</p>
<p>上面幾點不過是舉其一般，自然還有許多在下没有想到的，但是還有一點很有補充的必要，就是日常辦事方面，無論各部人員各應具有相互融會諒解透澈的觀念，使業務順利進展，一切困難都迎刃而解。</p>
<p>我想上面幾點基本辦法實施得有些效果以後，加以成本的削减，營業的擴增，然後有精密的計劃，同一的步伐去聯絡同業和洋貨抵敵，那時候收到的成效，也許在現下所未曾預料到的！</p>
<h3>廣告術和國貨商業</h3>
<p>— 惠民</p>
<p>近來廣告事業，漸能引起國貨商的注意，但大半商人心理，還不大信任，以爲空費金錢，僅獲小補，不如把這筆欵子，用在别種發展，收效較大。余意不然，因爲廣告不但能發展營業，且能革除夥友跑街的弊病，他的宣傳力很大，又能省一部分的經濟，實是營業上的利器。即如近世的柯達照像器具公司，彼等以巨金從事廣告，故該公司能名震全球，營業蒸蒸日上，這就是廣告有效的明證。現在把影響商業最著的，分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）廣告爲宣傳商品的利器譬如某公司新出一貨，倘用跑街及夥友等宣傳，效力不大，且時有錯誤，今用廣告術，以簡明的辭句，述貨物的特點，以奇異的文字，引社會的注意及需要，實爲最良的宣傳法。</p>
<p>（二）廣告能定貨物品質，與購貨人以一定的標準廣告使買主熟知某貨特點和商標，買主一見知爲某貨，不致受假冒者所欺騙。</p>
<p>（三）廣告能使成本減低需要旣繁，貨物便可暢銷，商人可從中取利，利多成本便可减低。</p>
<p>（四）廣告能使商品市價低落成本一輕，商品市價，亦因此低落，美國著名的毛羅EAMallorygSons製帽公司，自一九零六年用廣告術，銷路大暢，成本减輕，市價較前减去百分的十七。又雪勿納爾HartShaffnergMarn公司，亦用此術，十五年後，市價低去一半，社會需要的大受利益。</p>
<p>（五）廣告能免去跑街夥友的舞弊世風日下，夥友跑街，往往上下其手，因緣爲奸，店主及買客，並受欺侮，不但與該店經濟上發生影響，或竟因此損失信用，以致營業日衰，如用廣告方法，可免去此弊，且能保全一部的經濟及信用以上種種，廣告術的效用很大，招徠顧客，旣能直接爲營業的生財，减輕市價，又可間接爲社會造福，此廣告術所以應極端注意，深願國貨商採納才行。</p>
<h3>特銷﹁支那﹂</h3>
<p>— 洽成</p>
<p>你也許崇拜來　貨吧？好的，告訴你一件故事。</p>
<p>痘苗關係人的性命的，各國政府都加以詳細的檢查，中國衛生試騐所更製造標準品，因爲要保護民命，不得不愼重將事。</p>
<p>但是，在中國曾經風行過的日本痘苗，也許因爲來路貨的原故，曾被人所崇拜；然而當我在小盒上發現了﹁特銷支那﹂幾個字後，我懷疑的不得不設法追詢。</p>
<p>據一位學醫的朋友說，日本人特别的看顧中國人，明白中國人是怕麻煩的，所以將一批一批没有檢騐過的痘苗銷售於中國。可是因爲想怕誤會而被日本人使用，所以在小盒上加印了這幾個字。</p>
<p>你也許崇拜外國貨吧？好的，請聽我這件故事。</p>
<h3>國貨公司職員服裝之研究</h3>
<p>— 劉椀公</p>
<p>有一次惠羅公司，爲着推銷牠的衣料，開了一個盛大的時裝會，所有時裝的料子，都是牠的出品，同時牠的職員們，也都穿牠們的料子做成的衣服，這種廣告術，很有效力啊！</p>
<p>這回；我們提倡國貨；不止於狹義的商業競爭，簡直要算是一種救國運動！等於國際戰爭的先頭部隊。關係是多末重要啊！中國國貨公司，旣是上海唯一的國貨大本營，牠的一切的一切，都與我們整個的救國運動有關係，現在我們走進公司裏面，有一椿頂不順眼的事：就是店員和招待員及服裝問題；我看見許多招待員，腦前掛着國貨公司的徽章，穿的是西裝革履，固然，西裝的材料，也有國貨，但是招待員身上穿的，恐怕未見得都是用的國貨料子吧？許多小店員，雖然没有穿西裝，而他們的衣服材料，也大半是用外貨，我以爲中國絲綢，本極美觀適體，現在一般人競尚西服，加以蠶桑受外貨傾擠，國内絲綢業，已經衰落到極點！正當提倡國産絲綢，來做服裝，政府不是早已有命令了嗎？國貨公司正當首先奉行，仿照惠羅公司的辦法，舉行一種時裝會，同時把職員的西裝，一律换掉，統統穿起絲綢的便服來，店員們不能着絲綢，至少也要用國貨的布匹，不要再留這種矛盾的現象，給外人看笑話罷！</p>

<p>訪問記</p>
<h3>天虚我生訪問記</h3>
<p>— 烏和周</p>
<p>﹁天虚我生﹂四個字，在讀者的印象中一定很深。我們在市上買到了一包無敵牌牙粉，牠上面便刊有﹁天虚我生﹂的名字，因之，大家多急欲知道這﹁天虚我生﹂究竟是誰？但大家在没有知道他究竟是誰的時候，却都曉得他是一位文學家而兼實業家。其實，他的名字的所以受人注意。就是他生平對﹁文學﹂與﹁實業﹂努力得來的信譽。他初辦家庭工業社，是只有幾千塊錢，兒女家人，都在廠内工作。這種由家庭發軔的工業最令人可佩。</p>
<p>在十三歲時就喜歡讀報章的我，見到﹁家庭常識﹂一書上有著﹁天虚我生﹂先生其人，輒心嚮往之，後到上海，得常閱先生著作，更增一重信仰。嗣又在機聯會刊上讀先生和仰葊先生指導靑年的文章，句句是針砭的言論，所以腦筋中印象便格外深刻了。先生與仰葊先生最致力的，便是小工藝小本經營的指導和生利方法的介紹。</p>
<p>十九年的那年，我本在本市一家某舊式商店中幹事的，（其時適學業期滿）後來因覺得自己在這裏邊工作，有幾處地方與本願發生衝突。（痛心的是該店販賣仇貨）因之便冒冒失失的寫了一封信給天虚我生先生，（由機聯會轉）和他討論討論，結果他來了一封復信，并呌我到他辦事處去談話。</p>
<p>他的辦事處在南市國貨路，也就是家庭工業社内，我去的時候，心裏兀是想像着，想像天虚我生先生一定還不是一個老年人。後來見了面，一看却是一個于思于思的學者。</p>
<p>我本來不大會說話，但在這時候却不得不壯著胆制他談，我一面談着，一面用我的胖子溜視着他辦公室的四週，這乃是化騐室，有各種各樣的玻璃器皿，火酒燈還放在寫字檯上未移去，我知道他剛才又在化騐甚麽的了。他的試騐精神是愈老愈高興。</p>
<p>他說話得意的時候，喜歡捻着鬚子笑，滿面春風地。</p>
<p>﹁你不願意在那家舗子裏幹事嗎？誠然，這是有你的相當理由。那末，你就到我這邊來吧。﹂他說話是那樣直截地，那樣的示惠於我，我默感着。</p>
<p>後來，他又介紹我認議李常覺先生，李先生本也是一位小說家，但在這時巳任無敵牌公司中的經理，也是一個很忠誠坦的人。﹂</p>
<p>從此，一個少年的我，便在老年的他的公司中做僱員了，到如今已足有三個半年的經過。</p>
<p>最後，我來告訴諸位：天虚我生先生姓陳，字蝶仙，號栩園。杭州人。你們要知通他成功的經過嗎？請讀他自著的﹁工商業尺牘﹂，因爲這一部尺牘是他自述事業經過的歷史。</p>
<p>新工業介紹</p>
<h3>一個利用廢物的工廠</h3>
<p>— 衛玉</p>
<p>辦實業，原是利用厚生之意。但吾國新興實業，不爲不多，而眞能合乎利用厚生之意義者，實所罕見。即以紡織業論，可謂吾國近二十年來的大工業矣，紡餘之棉花，每年數量很多，然而能知利用者甚少，每以此種廢花，賤價售於外人，製造毯布藥棉等品，更輸入國内，一轉移間，他人坐獲巨利，吾則爲一漏巵，事之可惜，莫過於此。年來有人注意利用脚花（紡餘之棉）以營組織業者，以吾所知，祗有上海之民生紗廠，與常州戚墅堰之通成組織公司。民生之内容情形，未曾實地參觀，不敢加以評論，通成則在旬日前，隨黄任之江問漁王志莘諸君，前往參觀，同行者且有組織機械專家三人，故所得較多。覺其歷史，設備，成績，辦法，等等，都足使我們感到十分興趣，十分滿意，因記其大　　略如左，倘亦留心實業者，所樂知歟？</p>
<p>該廠在戚墅堰之西南，適居京滬線之中心，佔地一百六十餘畝，南臨運河，北接鐵道，在交通上固占極優之地位，環境尤饒明秀之勝。抵其地則道路坦廣，，綠楊夾徑，云通成廠所經營者。將至廠，見樓房數幢，並立廠前，有醫院，有學校，有合作社，有儲蓄部，亦爲廠方所創立以惠職工者。余於工業爲門外漢，而於種種之設備，深表贊同。廠長池君宗墨固十年前之敎育家也，爲余言，該廠創立以來，適屆十年，十年中經過許多頓挫，許多困難，甚至有不能按月給工資之時，而工人寗靜如常，絶不與廠方爲難，以爲廠址不在通都大市工人無惡習之故，余則以爲得力於平日勞資雙方融洽爲多。蓋人非木石，誰無良心，廠方平日之對工人，旣如家人父子，師長學生，爲其謀利益，無微不至，則工人之待廠方，亦如子女學生之對家長先生，祗有敬愛而已。</p>
<p>旣入廠，見各部工塲外，有閱晝室，娱樂室，浴室，花圃，菜園等，各處通路有路名，如熱河路吉林路等，以示不忘收復國土之意，其他如廚房，如食堂，如客廳，乃至如厠所，無一處不潔，無一物不齊，同行諸君皆爲贊嘆曰此學校化之工廠也，而整潔且過之。</p>
<p>廠内分製棉，漂染，紡纱，織物，刮毛，烘熨諸部，各以其連帶關係，順次排列。機器購自德國名廠，廠房亦由德國技師指導建築，故於安全，衛生，工作，種種方面，都能顧到。普通紗廠，必有一種特殊氣息，與絮花之紛飛，此廠獨無，機器與房屋構造之不同也。普通工廠之工人衣服骯髒，面目汚濁，此廠則職員工人都穿制服，面淸目秀，蓋設備之周到也。出品有四支六支粗紗，據同去之專家說，品質極佳，頗合織襪子及毯子之用。織物方面，有絨毯，軍用毯，圍巾，桌衣，車毯，以及藥棉，紗布等，色彩絨毛，與舶來品絶無差異，而定價特廉，蓋得力於池君等十年來孜孜不倦之研究精神。故無論形式方面，質地方面，工作方面，均有特别之成績。考其實，都爲脚花及吾人所廢棄之破絮，一經機械數度之旋轉，乃爲極美之上品，眞所謂巧奪天工矣。</p>
<p>該廠成立十年，困苦備嘗，而主持者牢定主意，絶不灰心，積七八年之奮鬥努力，乃有今日之成績。現在出品方面，銷售方面，以及工廠之制度方法種種方面，俱無問題，實可佩服。吾願池君更發揮其三不怕，（不怕失敗，不怕麻煩，不怕吃苦）與夫火熱心的　氣，（以上均見池君所著小册）積極設法擴充。吾更願我熱心實業之有力者，與之合作，提携互助。吾固不明工業，但此種工廠，無論如何，值得揄楊，值得贊助。此種工業多發展一分，外國之經濟侵略少一分也。</p>
<p>國貨消息</p>
<h3>值得介紹的重慶國貨介紹所（上）</h3>
<p>重慶中華國貨介紹所爲渝地之少數熱心提倡國貨者所發起，本年六月各發起人公推童少生，陳叔敬赴滬調查及接洽。返渝後又迭開籌備會議，乃决意組織中華國貨介紹所有限公司，認足股額十萬元，於二十一年十月一日正式成立。先後具文呈請實業部註册，及向市府備案。所址在城内下都郵街。並另行裝修鬥面。正式營業。聞前後營業額已有三四十萬元。最近經理陳君又來滬與各廠作更進一步之接洽，成績更佳，值得介紹於讀者。該所成立宗旨有二；其一爲提倡國貨之正面工作；因近三年中，川省進口貨值，每年平均一千三百萬兩。其中洋貨約占百分之八十。利權外溢，爲數甚鉅。一般人徒唱國貨救國之高調，皆未有具體方法，以作實施。故該所即應時産生，以作實地之鼓倡。此種企業，在四川尚屬剏見，不啻爲將來重慶（或四川）商業近展史中之第一頁。其一爲改良川内之商業制度，因川帮進貨，多恃莊客，方法習慣，至欠完善。如普通在外埠，採辦上貨過程；則有廠家，掮客，莊客，（保險回扣水脚回扣，浮報，雜費，莊繳）報關行，（報關費，水脚回扣，浮報，字號費）批發商，分銷店，消費等之層層盤繳。不但成本增高，且有莊客在申倒塌，逃避之類，以致川帮在申信用日薄。故該所對於辦貨規程，特簡化爲廠家，報關費，保險費，莊運費。介紹所字號，（批發商）分銷店，（大量消耗者，）直接消費者。其中可減少若干類似釐金之關卡。成本旣可減底，手續亦較簡捷；可與購買及消費者之一大便利。</p>
<p>童陳兩君在上海接洽廠家結果，得中華産銷合作協會之贊助，目前計有著名工廠五十餘家。</p>
<p>該所尚印有﹁緣起﹂一種，記述剏設之意義頗詳。兹亦探載如後：</p>
<p>﹁今日之中國，貧弱盲亂，至於極矣，考其原因，實在經濟事業之不能興盛耳。夫外人之努力，誠足以構成侵略之現象，而阻礙吾人之進展；但徒自呻吟詈駡，怨謗抗拒，而不研求自尊自强，公正競爭之道，决不能挽救於萬一也救濟之方，首重農業之改良，産業之發展，商業之順調。而欲達此目的，必須提倡國貨事業，例如原料之供給，製造之改良，成本之減輕，消費之合作等等，庶農産可以利用，實業可以繁興，入超可以減少，而貧富或可期於均衡矣。</p>
<p>查國貨事業，邇年以來；固鮮提倡，而其不發達之原因，則有四：（一）國人嗜用洋貨之習慣，（二）廠方缺乏外界之扶助，（三）消費者之不加以指示，（四）承銷者之不努力推廣。</p>
<p>欲治其病，須切實履行下列各事：（一）國人儘量採用國貨産品，（二）廠方儘量利用最新人材智識，（三）消費者儘量貢獻改良之道，（四）銷售者儘量誠實推銷。</p>
<p>庶消費品可替代一部分舶來貨，出品成本，日漸減輕，品質日漸精良，而國貨信用，逐漸可以造成。</p>

<p>你假如作一度全世界的檢閱，﹁兒童節﹂的紀念日差不多都有了。他們到了那個節期，有非常隆重的典禮，非常進步的表現。在我國呢，不過是從去年纔有這麽一個節日。</p>
<p>上海中華慈幼協會，是謀兒童幸福的。他鑒於世界各國都有兒童節，便毅然决然在民國二十年三月裏，並請上海市社會局，轉請市政府，轉呈國民政府核准。於是我們可愛的兒童節，就定在每年四月四日，還頒佈了兒童節的紀念辦法。我國的兒童，獲到這麽一個當有趣味的節日，應當怎樣欣喜啊！我知道尤其是上海的兒童們，在繁盛的都市裏，是多麽慶幸啊！</p>
<p>中國國貨公司，是國貨年頭産生的一個全國最完備的國貨公司。他們在這個偉大的兒童節第二週紀念的時候，在二樓南部大厦舉辦一個﹁兒童遊樂市﹂，意思是希望全市的兒童，在這個機會裏，來詳詳細細地把國貨認識一下，並且還可以有一個比較高下的機會。</p>
<p>他們的當事者，爲了這個﹁兒童遊樂市﹂，曾有十餘次的會議，决定大規模的來幹一下，要使全市的兒童，會把它深深地印在腦海裏。他們聘任林康侯君的公子（年十六歲）之福，爲﹁兒童遊樂市﹂市長，黄任之君的女公子（年十歲）秦回，潘仰堯君的女公子（年九歲）世維爲副市長。</p>
<p>在他們公司裏，從大門口的松柏牌樓的標幟起，進大門以及市塲裏，都有﹁小朋友！請到兒童遊樂市去。﹂﹁有子女的父母。請同到兒童遊樂市去。﹂······等的標語，下面寫著在南部，還畫着一個指路的箭頭，這樣的標語，一直張貼到﹁兒童遊樂市。﹂</p>
<p>四月四日兒童節的上午，我同了我的羊兒到他們的﹁兒童遊樂市。﹂去，從他們大門正中的大扶梯走上，向左轉灣上去，再靠右轉灣朝東直走，到綢緞部，再向右走，這樣就直達﹁兒童遊樂市﹂了。</p>
<p>顯明的標幟，炫耀着參觀者的眼目，把我們吸收進去。我和羊兒，走進﹁兒童遊樂市﹂的大門，便是﹁中山大道﹂，一直進去，﹁中山公園﹂在我們的眼前了，在牆壁上，有﹁增廣小朋友的眲聞﹂一條横標。偉大的國文孫中山先生磁器，很莊嚴的站着，令人肅然致敬。鮮麗的花草，奇異的小樹，多得不可勝數。﹁動物院﹂有﹁大鹿﹂﹁豪猪﹂﹁灰鶴﹂﹁猴﹂﹁白鸚﹂﹁貛﹂﹁熊﹂﹁鱷﹂﹁野兎﹂﹁金毛狗﹂﹁蒼鷹﹂······等，那一座小小的山上，有一位﹁壽星﹂站立在那裏，上面有﹁百樂洞﹂，下面的溪澗裏，有游泳的水禽，有來往的帆船。很能引起小朋友的欣快。﹁音樂座﹂，廣播着悠揚動聽的歌曲。﹁圖書館﹂的辦法，更見精密了，小小的書架，桌，椅，凳，······等。横條上寫着﹁啓發兒童的智慧。﹂兒童愛好的讀物，是商務，中華，世界，兒童······等書局出版的。小朋友很多的站着，或坐着翻閱，也有揀選了買回去看的。我給羊兒買了幾本兒童畫報，他很歡喜的接受着。</p>
<p>從圖書館出來，到﹁喔喔路﹂，這條路名是多麽奇特？進口就看見一隻大公鷄，雙眼有射人的電炬，很覺得威武。下面附着幾句：﹁老公鷄，喔喔啼；小朋友早早起，振精神，健身體。﹂小朋友們走來，大家總要這麽的讀一遍。﹁市長辦公室﹂就在﹁喔喔路。﹂﹁大菜間﹂﹁休息室﹂﹁會客室﹂﹁臥室﹂裏的用具，都是特製的兒童小小的用具。尤其是臥室來得引人入勝，小小的床有二隻，床上的小小棉被，小小枕頭，小小被單，······我的羊兒和我說；﹁爸爸！我上去睡一會兒好嗎？﹂我笑了起來，同時站在一處看的一位，也笑了起來，撫摩着羊兒的頭髮。</p>
<p>編餘</p>
<p>流動展覽會中華國貨指導所，於四月九日集合滬上著名工廠，在松江舉行國貨展覽會，這種深入民間的工作，大可提倡。滬杭路一帶的士女，大可乘這春光明媚的季節，聯袂偕往，一來借此旅行，領略雲問景色，一來借此提倡國貨，鼓動地方愛用國産的風氣。該會總幹事趙秉仁君謂這種展覽不限一地，松江展覽以後，滬杭路如杭州峽石，滬寗路如靑浦崑山津浦路如徐州蚌埠等，都在準備之列在一地工作完了以後，再往别地進行，這樣做去，包你國貨年的年底有很好的成績，可以表見出來，恭喜，恭喜！這是國貨年中很有價值的工作。</p>

<h3>推背圖</h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>我这里所用的﹁推背﹂的意思，是說：從反面來推測未來的情形。</p>
<p>上月的﹁自由談﹂裏，就有一篇﹁正面文章反看法﹂這是令人毛骨悚然的文字。因爲得到這一個結論的時候，先前一定經過許多苦楚的經騐，見過許多可憐的犧牲。本草家提起筆來，寫道：砒霜，大毒。字不過四個，但他却確切知道了這東西曾經毒死過若干性命的了。</p>
<p>里巷間有一個笑話：某甲將銀子三十兩埋在地裏面，怕人知道，就在上面豎一塊木板，寫道﹁此地無銀三十兩。﹂隔壁的阿二因此却將這掘去了，也怕人發覺，就在木板的那一面添上一句道，﹁隔壁阿二勿曾偷。﹂這就是在敎人﹁正面文章反看法﹂。</p>
<p>但我們日日所見的文章，却不能這麽簡單。有明說要做，其實不做的；有明說不做，其實要做的；有明說做這樣，其實做那樣的；有其實自己要這麽做，倒說别人要這麽做的；有一聲不響，而其實倒做了的。然而也有說這樣，竟這樣的：難就在這地方。</p>
<p>倒如近幾天報章上記載着的要聞罷：</p>
<p>一，乂乂軍在乂乂血戰，殺敵乂乂乂乂人。</p>
<p>二，乂乂談話：决不與日本直接交涉，仍然不改初衷，抵抗到底。</p>
<p>三，芳澤來華，據云係私人事件。</p>
<p>四，共黨聯日，該僞中央己派幹部乂乂赴日接洽。</p>
<p>五，乂乂乂乂·········</p>
<p>倘使都當反面文章看，可就太駭人了。但報上也有﹁莫干山路草棚船百餘隻大火﹂，﹁乂乂乂乂廉價貝有四天了﹂等大槪無須﹁推背﹂的記載，於是乎我們就又胡塗起來。</p>
<p>聽說，推背圖本是靈騐的，某朝某帝怕他淆惑人心，就添了些假造的在裏面，因此弄得不能預知了，必待事實證明之後，人們這才恍然大悟。</p>
<p>我們也只好等着看事實，幸而大槪是不很久的，總出不了今年。</p>
<h3>父與子</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>屠格湼夫（Turgenieff）的名著父與子中，有一段尼古拉對他的哥哥說的傷心話：﹁哥哥，你知道我工記起了什麽？有一次我同我們的娘爭一件事；她大發脾氣，不肯聽我的話。末了我對她說：﹁自然你不能了解我的，我們是兩個時代的人。﹂她生氣極了：可是我想道：﹁這有什麽法想呢？這丸藥是苦的，可是不得不吞下去的。﹂現在是輪到我們了，我們的後代可以對我們說：﹁你不是我們時代的人丨丨吞你的丸藥吧！﹂﹂這一類的喜劇，無窮無盡的以各種方式演出，總有一方面是苦痛的。﹂啊！蓮心是苦的，因爲他已經老了！﹂</p>
<p>現代中國，靑年們很多很多變成反動份子，殺戮囚禁並不曾减輕這嚴重的情勢，或者是上天示罰，又降下那一○八個魔星罷；但情形非常特殊：戴季陶先生有一個在獄的姪兒，陳樹人先生有一個上斷頭台的兒子，廖仲凱先生的兒子最近又被捕，據說堯帝還有一個在國外的丹朱：何以每個偉人家裏都降生一顆魔星呢？古代聖人，文王有姬旦，禹有啓，生得寗馨兒：現代聖人，却只有商均，管蔡，未免上天太偏頗了，或者舜和堯也在那裏相顧嘆息道：﹁這有什麽法想呢？這丸藥是苦的，可是不得不吞下去的！﹂</p>
<p>或曰：聖人作周易，　之初六：﹁幹父之　，有子，考旡咎厲，終吉﹂。象曰：﹁幹文之　，意承考也﹂。堯在某一時候，切齒咬牙以爲丹朱坍他的台：那知他升天以後，丹朱轟轟烈烈做一番大事業，替他增光不少：他在黄泉路上，又張開嘴來掀髯大笑：﹁此吾家千里駒也！﹂所以聖人說：﹁兒子能糾正父親的錯誤，那才是好兒子！父親叨了兒子的光，得了好結局了！﹂所以尼古拉安慰保羅道：﹁現在輪到我們了，我們的後代可以對我們說：﹁你不是我們時代的人，吞你的丸藥吧！﹂﹂</p>
<p>四十年前，葉德輝作翼敎叢編來駡康有爲；三十年前，舉國士大夫攻擊孫中山先生：十年前，林琴南以及許多衛道先生攻擊陳獨秀胡適之：現在，衛道先生又在攻擊誰了呢？﹁大江東去，浪淘盡千古風流人物！﹂時光老人眞是不容情的批判者，他把你一脚踢開去！</p>
<h3>縫窮婦</h3>
<p>— 彭雪珍</p>
<p>住在鳳凰街左近的人們，有兩個月没曾看見那縫窮婦帶着孩子來了。</p>
<p>這情形已繼續了三年：大街上，靠牆坐着的那苦婦人，每朝携着一筐破布和一個才會走的孩子，從西面來，又在黄昏時向西面回去。</p>
<p>每天，婦人像餓鷹似的睜大着眼等雇客：店舗裏的夥計，沿街呌賣的小販，臨街小屋裏的單身漢子們······她從不多索，而且很認眞的縫，她常說：他們的錢也和她的一樣不易得，苦人不該欺騙苦人。</p>
<p>秋風吹起的時候，人們都畏縮着懶得動彈，便也不想到補綴什麽了。婦人在擔下閑得發慌，望望破籃子裏面睡着的針和綫，臉上時時浮現深重的哀愁丨丨没吃底。</p>
<p>孩子呢，坐在小凳上，搓着兩隻紅手，用嘴裏的熱氣呵凍。﹁媽呀，肚餓······﹂。一聲，兩聲，和蛇一般，痛囓着婦人的心。</p>
<p>﹁乖乖兒坐着，等會兒媽買餅你吃﹂。孩子聽母親的哄，暫時不做聲，凄慘地微笑，但肚餓可不哄他，只片刻，又是﹁媽，肚餓······﹂！</p>
<p>搜遍身邊，才夠買一塊大餅塞孩子的嘴：﹁慢點兒吃，小心噎着，﹂她皺眉，想，假如北風能夠飽肚子時·········</p>
<p>談閒話時，人們聽她說：﹁江北的飢荒把我們趕來的；人家說這裏是天堂，有福享，誰知連飯都掙不得一個飽啊！他爸爸拉車，冬天也只有喝風的份兒呀！﹂</p>
<p>前一個月，大餅店的小徒弟從外面帶來一個消息，說是在城外草棚左近呌賣時，有人在哭喊，聲音活像是那縫窮婦，走近時，瞧見她的孩子被擱在門前板凳上，小腦袋上紮着白布，痴痴地瞪着小眼睛。</p>
<p>春天，縫窮婦又回來了，然而是一個人。髮髻上添了幾圈白繩，瘦削的臉更瘦削了，眸子没了光芒。</p>
<p>人們哀憐地瞧着她，奇怪她的孩子的隠失。</p>
<p>﹁孩子麽？賣了，賣了他給他爸爸買棺材了。我養得活他嗎？窮人不該有孩子啊！﹂</p>
<p>冒着風雨，縫窮婦無休止地朝暮來去</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>﹁林先生，我們家裏的亭子間就要空下來了。再等兩天，你眞的搬過來住？﹂</p>
<p>﹁我那邊因爲有東洋人常來往，大嘈　了。近來又來多了兩三個日本人，我看見就討厭。</p>
<p>昨天晚上我都没有回去睡呢。﹂</p>
<p>﹁那末，你快點搬過來好了。﹂</p>
<p>﹁没有房子怎麽好呢？﹂</p>
<p>﹁暫時和我們同住吧。只二三天，有什麽要緊。﹂</p>
<p>﹁和你們同住一間房子？﹂</p>
<p>海泉像嚇了一跳，睜大他的眼睛反問。</p>
<p>﹁有行軍床，怕什麽，白天可以收拾起來。﹂</p>
<p>﹁······························﹂</p>
<p>海泉一時没有回答。但有些鶩異這位女性的奇特而大胆的態塵。</p>
<p>他和秋英走上樓上來了。</p>
<p>﹁走了半天，到什麽地方去了？﹂</p>
<p>世光惡狠狠地說，大槪他是因爲餓得急了的緣故吧。</p>
<p>﹁嘿！這才奇怪！你還問我到什麽地方去了！是你自已要我去的！不到諸先生那邊去，也有錢買這些東西？················﹂</p>
<p>﹁小孩子的藥呢？﹂</p>
<p>看世光的神氣似乎是怕秋英的話說多了，一切的秘密會給外人聽見，不好意思，他忙轉了話頭。</p>
<p>﹁等下諸先生會送來，我託了他。﹂</p>
<p>﹁你看，小孩子的事便不理，只買那些東西！﹂</p>
<p>﹁那一點點的傷風咳嗽有什麽要緊呢。嬰孩自己藥片又還有幾粒在家裏。咳藥水是夜裏吃的。下半天諸先生會送來，有什麽好急頭呢。秋英一面换穿衣裳，一面駁她的丈夫。</p>
<p>﹁自己買好了帶回來，不是省得諸先生走一趟麽？你做事總是那樣麻煩的！······﹂</p>
<p>﹁一點也不麻煩！就是因爲要他來，才託他買藥片和藥水的。託了他，他就不能不送來了。············啊呀！林先生，怎麽你儘望着我，怪難爲情的。﹂</p>
<p>給秋英一說，海泉滿臉通紅了，忙低了頭，同時偷看了一下曹世光在這一瞬間的態度。因爲他確實是偷望了一下秋英穿着小衣的姿態。</p>
<p>﹁老林！﹂</p>
<p>給世光一呌，海泉的胸口怱然拍拍地跳動起來了。他想，世光眞地爲這件事和自已開談判了麽？</p>
<p>﹁什麽？﹂</p>
<p>他略抬起頭來看還在抱着小孩子的世光。</p>
<p>，坐在小凳上細細地縫，地上射着她焭獨的影子。人們在陽光中迎她走來，在暮靄裏目送她提着筐子歸去，覺得她的後影是在漸漸地瘦小下去，步子是那麽無力而又緩慢的。</p>
<h3>蘧廬絮語</h3>
<p>— 子展</p>
<p>（十四）最古之非孝論者</p>
<p>吾友聚仁先生嘗於濤聲周刊述非孝故事。蓋在北京五四運動之後，思想界突呈劇變，學生最爲活躍，湘浙之省立第一師範學校，同爲當時當地新思潮運動之中心，浙校之施存統，湘校之毛澤東，固一時嶄然露頭角之人物也。施存統作非孝論，大爲浙之守舊者所非。聚仁與施同學，謂施素拘謹，爲有道氣之國文敎師所器重，孰知其一鳴驚人至此耶？予曰；最古之非孝者，亦爲極重孝道之人，孔融是也。當五四運動時，林琴南嘗以書抵蔡子民，痛斥胡適之陳獨秀之流，提倡白話，至覆孔孟，滅倫常。並謂非孝之說，始自孔融。蔡先生覆書，略謂孔融之非孝論：</p>
<p>父之於子，當有何親？論其本意，實爲情欲發耳！子之於母，亦復奚爲？譬如寄物瓶中，出則離矣！</p>
<p>出自路粹枉奏，路之爲人至不足道。予以爲路粹雖阿附曹氏，承望風指，故入融罪，然孔融禰衡同以言論放蕩見稱，路之奏言，未必一無根據。意者孔融以曹氏專權，毁壞名節，崇尚詐術，故激而爲此偏宕之言耶？據舊籍所傳，孔融固赫然一衛道專家，提倡孝道之人也。藝文類聚八十五載：</p>
<p>孔文舉爲北海相，有遭父喪，哭泣墓側，色無憔悴，文舉殺之。又有母病瘧，思食新麥，家無，乃盜鄰人熟麥而進之。文舉聞，特賞曰；﹁無有，來討；勿復盜也。﹂盜而不罪者，以爲勤於母飢；哭而見殺者，以爲形悲而心否。</p>
<p>孔融之賞眞孝，懲僞孝，矯激至此，用心亦良苦矣。又嚴可均輯全晋文卷四十九引傅玄傅子補遺：</p>
<p>漢末有管秋陽者，與弟及伴一人避亂俱行，天雨雪，糧絶。謂其弟曰：﹁今不食伴，則三人俱死。﹂乃與弟共殺之，得糧達舍，後遇赦無罪。此人可謂善士乎？孔文舉曰：﹁管秋陽愛先人遺體，食伴無嫌也。﹂荀侍中難曰：﹁秋陽貪生殺生，豈不罪耶？﹂文舉曰：﹁此伴非曾友也。若管仲啖鮑叔，貢禹食王陽，此則不可。向所殺者，猶烏獸而能言耳。今有犬齧一狸，狸齧一鸚武，何足怪也！昔重耳戀齊女而欲食狐偃，叔孫敖怒楚師而欲食伍參，賢哲之忿，猶欲啖人，而况遭窮者乎？</p>
<p>此孔融禮敎喫人之說也，惜乎未爲反孔子反禮敎之吳虞所見，不然，彼之﹁吃人的禮敎﹂一文中，又多一證矣。</p>

<h3>絲茶歐美絲銷悲觀</h3>
<p>紐約里昂等處生絲市塲、期現絲廠進仍懈、絲價繼續下降、日絲價廉、中意絲竟至無人問訊、絲電不轉、滬埠絲市奄無生氣、昨祗信孚進姊妹牌十三十五條紛黄廠經十包、價四百九十五兩、祥記進三Ｋ牌沔陽黄粗絲十五包、價三百八十五兩、午後覧無市面可報、</p>

<h3>摩洛哥茶市報跌</h3>
<p>法屬摩洛哥、爲華茶銷路之一極大市塲、年來我國路莊土莊平水各路綠茶、輸入該埠之數、已由二十萬箱增銷至三十三四萬箱、自去年日商三井三義等行、裝運大批日茶、輸入該埠銷售後、華茶頗受重大之打擊、據現下英商行家、所得摩洛哥茶訊、邇來日茶銷路、雖無顯著之進步、但華茶市面、亦較前兩月淸淡、就珍眉一項言之、平時每月可銷五六十箱、現下僅銷三四十箱、其原因實由於該處農産物收成歉折、農民經濟困迫、購買力爲之大减、因此英法茶商、對於手中存茶、不得不讓價求售、平均每擔較前月見跌二十五佛郎、商家難免虧折云、</p>
<h3>油市柏油有急轉直下之勢</h3>
<p>柏油前因燭洶正在需用、銷塲漸見活動、乃因各處存貨不厚之際、而走化稍暢、市卽向上、漢口麻城油售至十六兩、重荆亦加十七兩、形勢頓見緊張、似有再加一兩之趨向、然燭淘夏淘用塲、所取均選擇高品、且用者不多、而爲時又暫、故時僅半月、皆將備齊、以現在觀察、所缺祇十之一二而已、因此市面卽有急轉直下之勢、據連日漢函所詳、重荆已跌十六兩四錢、前行麻城油跌十五兩四錢、前行十五兩二錢、來源見旺、底積亦厚、本來下身貨、全賴皂廠去路、今庚因牛油較柏油爲廉、故皂用已改途而求、致身骨稍軟之柏油、銷路依然停頓、遠不逮高貨之活潑、乃高貨受低貨之掣肘、隨之而降、實亦無法砥柱也、本埠行家此次確曾辦進一批、然已銷去大半、故現在存底、並不甚厚、但觀夏銷已過去十之七八、此後銷塲漸見零落、所以行家亦不願多備、近日市上進出、亦漸趨沉寂、惟價格已跌至此步、縱再跌亦已有限、大槪此後情菜長疲短俏而已、行家售盤、定價雖未更改、然暗中已在廉售、市價不一、大槪日内必須跌價、</p>
<h3>疋頭春夏薄貨開出三十餘箱</h3>

<h3>中厚嗶嘰頻跌之原因</h3>
<p>受漢令蓬盛行打擊</p>
<p>中厚嗶嘰、爲春秋暢銷之貨、莊靑比元色爲廣銷、目下正及其時、咸購售價自二兩餘起至七八兩不等、其最旺銷者、推寶克寶多與東方三○○八并三○○一及天佑一千號二千號數種、不料該類種厚嗶嘰、自上週起續跌、現市回顧旬日前、每碼平均降落數分至錢餘、頻跌原因、以新盛行之漢令蓬打擊爲多、昨天佑一千號二千號均减售三兩四錢、甚至暗盤成交三兩三錢二分半者亦大有人在、東方三○○八比天佑稍爲硬些、然亦縮少二分半、爲三兩三錢半矣、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>松岡向美人大吹大拍</h3>
<p>— 濟</p>
<p>外交藝術，誠如一萬花筒，搖一搖，變一變，翻新出奇，不難令人目眩心迷，但用邏輯方法，把它歸納起來，則所謂外交藝術，亦絶似處世藝術，一言蔽之，﹁吹牛﹂﹁拍馬﹂而已矣，不信，請一觀日本出席國聯代表松岡洋右，新近遊說美國的眞工夫，</p>
<p>說甚麽﹁日本現無領土或要塞在美國海洋内，日本未嘗爲美國利益之威脅，﹂這是松岡吹拍工夫之第一式。，不啻帖耳埀手地先向美人來個立正姿勢。，　　嗣則不惜有損平日稱不絶口，﹁帝國﹂﹁皇軍﹂之尊嚴身分，更顯其巴結態度，拱手獻給美人一頂高帽，願拜下風云，﹁日本尚無資格與世界最富庶最安全之國家作戰，﹂這是松岡吹拍工夫之第二式。，不啻拿出東洋人固有之敬禮特色，向美人頻頻行其九十度之折腰禮。！</p>
<p>最後，竟至暗送秋波，袒胸露臂地誘惑戲媚於美人云，﹁中國大部份人民皆貧困，如何能購買巨額美貨，日本則所購美貨，比其餘遠東各地爲巨﹂等語，意味甘馥。，若非魯男子，其不神魂搖蕩者幾希矣。！這是松岡吹拍工夫之第三式。，但他是代表東洋人的什麽特色禮却不知道。。不過覺得松岡這第三式的工夫，煞似。，﹁我的肉。，比他好﹂的口吻。；不過經他變化一下。，把它運用於外交藝術上去罷了。。東洋人這樣的摹仿性，不但西洋人佩服。，連我也佩服。，佩服到最高程度的五體投地。！</p>
<p>雖然，事實不但﹁最雄辯﹂，而且最會與慣說假話的人搗蛋的，任憑松岡的三寸不爛，能吐蓮花，而極盡大拍美人的馬屁，大吹自己的牛皮之能事，可是高鼻子。，藍眼睛。，走起路來，似乎膝部不會灣曲的美人。，畢竟不會像你同文同種同洲的大阿哥。，只要矮弟弟肯張金口。，無不洗耳恭聽。；不但恭聽。，而且深信！譬如：佔了瀋陽。，不要吉黒；佔了錦州，不要榆關；佔了熱河。，不進長城。！　　國民新聞社華盛頓電，上月十四日，林百克律師在華盛頓大學演說，謂﹁日本之侵入熱河，尚未完成其擴張版圖計畫，將來世界列强，終將共起剷除日人黷武主義，﹂是日人之野心陰謀。，早在松岡未登美洲海岸之先。，已經林氏一語道破。，難道松岡充耳未聞麽。？怎麽今日還還掩耳盜鈴地向美人大吹法螺。？松岡具有這樣吹拍大本領。，無以名之。，名之曰。，面皮眞厚。，膽量十足。！</p>
<h3>生活的出發</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>一木離開粉紅色的學生生活，已是整週年了，說來痛心，他並不是全無才學的　子，可是一向總謀不着起碼的職差，每回他抱着滿腔希望去追求生活的出路，而結果總是落得一個大空，事實誠然使他失望，一般平日最親切的朋友，雖然是滿口說力爲設法，也好像是孩子們玩肥皂泡，一個吹起，一個消失，這泡，這夢，也就玩夠了。</p>
<p>然而生活是迫切的逼着解决，即使是熬住性子的苦，也得多少有些投靠，於是他想嘗嘗拍賣腦筋的滋味看，於是他便摒除一切的希冀，埋着頭拿起鋼筆在纸上沙沙的寫，果然是出産豐裕，而且自己看看，却也嘸啥，於是他便得意的向各報各刊寄發，結果呢，雖不似石沉大海的没有回響，却也是十有九空，顯然離事先自己的希望線好似有十萬八千里之遙，</p>
<p>自然又好像是一場夢，夢愈來得多，也就愈使他感到己身生活的恐懼，危殆·</p>
<p>這是一道新的曙光了，朋友Ｃ看他老是閒着，果然不是生意經，帶了滿肚子的熱情來說；﹁我且告訴你﹂個辦法，這辦法也不用吹，也不用拍，全由眞本領去碰，碰着了，便是一道金光，說不定解决了自己的生活，還能接濟家庭，丨便是去應每日報紙上常時登有的招聘·﹂</p>
<p>是的·一木也曾想到過這一着，不過一向還在躊躇，因爲他曾經聽過不少的人說，大部分那是玩花頭經的，即或也有眞的，却全要靠天命，但所謂﹁天命﹂這東西，是不是可靠，究竟費理解，所以他一向還不敢去輕爾嘗試。</p>
<p>自經過Ｃ的一度慫慂後，這才决心去嘗試一次看，於是他毫不吝惜的定下一份報，果然第一早他翻開報來看，便在分類廣告中發見了﹁聘請﹂一欄，他更放亮眼光，細心的巡視下去，而竟發見了有一處要請編輯數位，條件並不苛刻，只須寄去小品文兩篇，另附退件郵資二角，說審查過後，仍在原報原欄揭布，他看了又看，彷彿就有一道金光在紙上跳躍，他想；﹁說不定是天數到了﹂！於是他火急火忙的依了條件辦全，親身跑到郵局用掛號寄發，回家時一路上口裏吹着唿哨，特地轉向朋友Ｃ家玩了一歇。</p>
<p>他明白在二三日以内，當然是不會有消息的，所以他雖然定了份報，總是原封不動的擺在一邊，這是他自﹁一二八﹂滬戰以後新有的性子，他覺得看報是最苦惱的事丨丨只見侵略，鎭靜，恐慌，搶案，姦淫，·········一類的紀述，充滿了篇幅，自己又是這樣的一個低能兒，眞不如不看的好，免得心痛。</p>
<p>第五天他下意識的把報揭開一看，發見在原欄刊登着另外一則廣告。</p>
<p>第六天他剛揭開第一張，觸目便是幾個特號鉛字﹁承德失陷﹂，他便放不下敢再翻了；﹁暴日更跑進了熱河，不是隔我的老窠乂乂省只有一界之交了麽！唉！﹂他一度喘氣後，究竟還有心事翻下去，爲的是個人的生命，也不可輕棄，於是他翻到了本埠增刊，最初射進他的眼簾的，是成排的﹁自我職業介紹者，﹂又使得他來一度强烈的喘氣。</p>
<p>最後他胆悸的去翻看那原欄，仍在登着另外一則廣告。</p>

<h3>懺悔</h3>
<p>— 金質</p>
<p>這學期我自進校以來，因爲和了幾個懶惰朋友的同租校外，所以每天差不多在十點鐘才起床，縱令早點醒來，也不肯立刻起來，還儘躺在床上，翻翻報紙或小說，等到起來，洗完了臉，已經是吃中飯的時候了。吃過了飯，我們便夾着幾本書，到學校裏來望望，打聽打聽有没有敎員請假，威閙風潮的事情發生。假若没有敎員請假及風潮發生，又遇着有辯才的滑稽敎員在上課，我們就去聽聽；假若物理敎員或數學敎員，在胡扯着什麽公式及講三角函數ＳinＣos時；我們便打着呵欠，抽出高價的自來水筆，向拍紙簿上胡塗，或趁先生不看見時，溜出課堂，到馬路上白相白相，或去看電戲，來消遣消遣；天色晚了，便到館子店裏吃晚飯，吃過後，一同回寓裏來，搓四圈八圈的麻雀，然後睡覺。這是我們的日常生活，也就是上海ＭodernStudents的日常生活。</p>
<p>﹁夜裏不睡覺，日裏打磕噸﹂這大槪是錢先生的國文課吧！我底精神已疲乏不堪，兩眼矇矓不知不覺地走入睡鄉了　　﹁質兒！你旣由惡劣的環境裏爭扎出來，給你求學，你是多麽的僥倖呀！你非少爺公子可比，他們根本不是來求學問的，只因爲在家無聊，又加旁人的非議，所以出來到一個高等流氓製造所，旅館式的野鷄學校來，拿一張簡直等於廢紙的文憑，來欺騙父母，以免旁人的耳目，搓麻雀，嫖妓女，抽抽烟不算什麽一回事：要曉得你是個貧家子弟，要求眞正的學問，造戴有用的人才，你現在已十九歲，到了高中三年級了。還不自知，要我來嘮嘮叨叨麽？大厦將傾獨木難持，你下學期亦恐咸問題！質兒！做父母的那個不要他的兒子好學成名？假使做兒子的不願自甘墮落的話；現在你旣這樣的不長進，我也再無血汗可供你了。一切的一切，都使我灰心失望，我不怨家庭敎育欠嚴，也不恨學校敎育失敗，我只覺得一個人學壞容易，學好難，你已受過高等敎育了，試問四萬萬的同胞中有幾分之幾受過高等敎育？做父母的義務也已盡夠了，你自己去找生路吧！我已不要你這不長進的兒子了﹂！</p>
<p>我聽了這話之後，好像觸了電似的麻木着，良心上受了極大的責備，涙珠不自主地由眼眶内蔌蔌的流下﹁父親！你的話我很明白，除在上帝前懺悔以外，向你認罪改過﹁以前種種譬如昨日死，以後種種譬如今日生﹂，我以後再不如此了。父親！饒恕我吧！﹂鏜······鏜的退課鈴，把我驚醒，而兩袖却已濕透了。</p>

<h3>抵抗</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個年未弱冠的孩子，不但家境貧寒，且又生性愚庸，意志薄弱。幼時在鄉村初小肄業，後因家父失業，故不得不輟學閒居。及到十三歲那年，隨父親來申習商。從此過那非人類的三年學徒生活。在此三年内，不知受了多少寃屈和鞭撻，流了多少血涙。去年總算是徒刑期滿。可是我腦力昏庸，爲人懦弱。諸先生及世兄們自謂聰明强暴，時以侮辱謊騙等欺我。而我呢，不但無欺彼等之野心，就是彼等欺我，亦不過忍受而已！嗣有鄰居周君，爲我知己。見而不平，是助我與彼等戰鬭。雖每戰皆捷，然我心中每不以謂然，蓋彼等欺我，在我不過受一些痛癢，亦犯不上戰鬭也。惟我與彼等想想；究不知彼等有何益處。我眞不懂得聰明人的頭腦，和强暴人的心理。</p>
<p>先生：請你詳細地解釋我聽罷。末了還要請問先生。對於强暴者來侵略時，應取何種態度？抵抗呢？還是忍受？强暴者爲何要侵略他人？强暴就是聰明的表示麽。假使全世界的人，個個聰明，個個强暴，豈不是成了古時之野蠻世界麽？我願上帝把全世界的人民，改爲昏庸，與我一樣。那末就無侵略的憂慮了。</p>
<p>先生！再會，祝</p>
<p>你康健　　　　　吳霞霞上</p>
<p>乂　　乂　　　乂　　　乂</p>
<p>編者按：我們從吳君的來信中，窺見了失業問題的嚴重；學徒制度的黑暗；高級職員待遇低級職員的苛刻；强大壓迫弱小的情形。在寥寥的數語裏，却充分地暴露了畸形社會的種種黑幕！可是，這却不是吳君所要我們答覆的。</p>
<p>吳君的小小問題，却象徵了現在的中國；在起初，受了人家的壓迫，總是﹁忍受﹂，到目前，的確已感到﹁抵抗﹂的迫切需要了。從﹁忍受﹂到﹁抵抗﹂的過程中，利害如何，誰郁瞭然於胸。所以我們答復吳君是﹁以口還口，以眼還眼，對付强暴的侵略，祇有决心的抵抗。﹂</p>
<p>同時我們要能夠認識時代，明瞭現實。個個人都聰明，固然不會成﹁古時的野蠻世界﹂；即使個個人都﹁昏庸，﹂也决不會﹁没有侵略的憂慮﹂的。因此我們希望吳君趕快革除這種思想，養成一種勇氣，要能夠像貴友周君的扶助弱小；否則至少也要具有抵抗﹁强暴﹂﹁侵略﹂的力量。其餘，我們想没有﹁解釋﹂的必要了。</p>

<h3>夢裏光陰（二十一續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>毛女士的流利而美好的談鋒這使伍逸聽得非常得趣。</p>
<p>﹁不過，我却是一個例外的讀者！﹂毛女士讓老媽子獻過荼之後，又帶着一種極美觀而文雅的表情，繼續說道：﹁我時常跟玉麟說，寫文章的人簡直等于一條蠶，他們不停的想，不停的寫，正和蠶的不停的吐絲一般無二：吐絲吐到蠶自已力盡才歇，寫文章的也許在他們的精神没有銷磨盡凈之前，也永不能停止他們底筆的活動···！﹂</p>
<p>玉麟打裏面捧出了一堆咖啡糖來，暫時打斷了他夫人的高談，和伍逸的傾聽。﹁所以；我認爲與其寫文章，還是敎書的比較省力一些！﹂毛女士很天眞地把從咖啡糖上揭下來一片錫紙，搓做一團，用一條手指輕地彈出了窗外去。﹁伍先生！我很願意你能夠放棄你的報館編輯的地位，···﹂</p>
<p>她說到這裏，玉麟忍不住揷口進來，說明了他們今天特地約伍逸來的眞意。原來毛女士有一位母舅，乃是黨國要人乂乂的得意門生，最近他弄到了國立乂乂大學的校長的位置，因爲他自已不過是一個小政客，對於校務很外行，怕弄出了笑話來，便有心要物色一個人去當敎務主任；這意思恰巧給毛女士知道了，忙竭力給她所時常仰慕着，惋惜着的伍逸推薦，結果居然得到了她母舅的同意，於是玉麟便决意先在他們家裏介紹雙方先行會晤。</p>
<p>伍逸對於毛女士的深能體會自己的苦况，而予以未經請求的自動的援助，不由不引起了一種無代價的知巳之感。這一晚，在會見了他們的母舅，决定了待遇的條件以後，他還是興奮得不想走，毛女士跟他的談話像流水般的儘說不完，一直到十一點半，伍逸才無可奈何的走回星報館去。</p>
<p>走出星報館踏進乂大，伍逸的生活才上正軌，他居然也在早上七八點鐘的時候，吸到了灰分較薄的上海空氣，並見到了初升的朝陽：可是多年的記者生活，已使他養成了一種非到十一點鐘不能睡覺的惡習慣，而乂大的辦公時間，至多到六點鐘就完了，餘下的閒工夫，伍逸便全把牠消磨在玉麟的家裏。</p>
<p>玉麟因爲當律師的不能不交際的緣故，晚上倒並不常在家裏，伍逸却風雨無阻的從不悮卯，往往跟毛女士談得盾飛目舞，不知夜之已深：就是玉麟在家裏的時候，他說的話，也還抵不上她夫人所說的﹂半咧？</p>

<h3>After the Recapture of Haiyang Town, the Enemy Gathers at Shimen Village and Along the Liujiang River</h3>
<p>Repeated Attacks Were Ferocious But Ultimately Repelled</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Conducted Reconnaissance Over Luan County, Qian'an, and Lulong</p>
<p>British Troops Land on Qin Island to Protect Kailuan Mining Area, Japanese Soldiers Withdraw to Ships</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the recapture of Haiyang Town on the 4th, the enemy forces are now concentrated in the Shimen Village and Liujiang River area, totaling five to six thousand men. Our forces, due to deployment for the defense of Haiyang, did not pursue deeply. Two enemy warships at Xieliangkou used searchlights to illuminate our Haiyang positions throughout the night of the 4th, anticipating enemy reinforcements and a large-scale counterattack. A major battle is expected in the front lines today or tomorrow. The situation in the Qin Island and Haiyang area remains tense. A portion of our forces is now in Haiyang, defending against enemy advances, paying close attention to the east and west sides of □□, to prevent activities by enemy marines from Qin Island and Beidaihe. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army is advancing on Shimen Village, attacking the sea, and gradually expanding its military operations within the Kailuan mining area along the railway line. British naval landing forces have landed to protect the Kailuan mining area. Thirty to forty Japanese naval landing forces from Qin Island warships completely withdrew to the ships yesterday to avoid misunderstandings with the British marines. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy rebels who once occupied Houzhuang, our Haiyang, were routed by our □□ regiments, and after recapturing Houzhuang, Haiyang, the enemy retreated towards the Zhashi (Bombed City) tribes. Yesterday evening, after 9:00 PM, over three thousand enemy troops advanced towards our Haiyang from Hanzhuang, Xiaojiagang, Zhaozhuang, and other places along the Liujiang railway. The battle was extremely fierce. Two battalions of our □ regiment made a flanking maneuver to Mazhuang, encircling the enemy. After a fierce battle throughout the night, the enemy was finally repelled. The remnants of the enemy retreated to Heishanwo, and our forces are currently in pursuit. Over a thousand enemy troops from places like Malianzhuang and Anminzhai, planning to attack our Qin Island, did not dare to recklessly advance due to the defeat of the enemy forces at Houzhuang, Haiyang. Our □ division launched a counterattack from Shishan, engaging the enemy in a fierce battle for a long time. The enemy could not withstand it and retreated towards Changqiaoling. Our forces are now combining with the left-wing units to advance in a counterattack. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) After the recapture of Haiyang Town, the enemy continues to launch repeated attacks. There was a fierce battle at dawn on the 5th, ending at Chenshi (around 8 AM). From morning to noon, enemy artillery continuously bombarded our positions from the east of Haiyang. The artillery fire was intense, shaking Qinbu.

<h3>Rebel Troops Falsely Claim to be Anti-Japanese Allied Army</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain important figure, this time when the enemy rebels attacked Shihe, attempting to occupy our eastern Luan, they are falsely claiming that the rebel troops are the "Anti-Japanese Allied Army." The purpose of this is: (1) To falsely claim the name of the "Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army," pretending that it is not a Japanese initiative, to confuse the League of Nations; (2) If disputes with various countries arise on the Beining Line and in the Kailuan area, they can shift responsibility to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, claiming it has nothing to do with the Japanese side; (3) If they occupy eastern Luan, it can serve as a buffer zone against areas outside the Great Wall, and further plot to take over Beiping and Tianjin. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed all countries in the world of Japan's treacherous plan in detail. (5th Dispatch)</p>

The Commander-in-Chief has received many letters from officers and soldiers requesting to set off, but serving the country does not necessarily mean going to the front. Fujian is very close to Taiwan, and national defense must be prepared. In 1921, when we were preparing to send volunteer troops to the Northeast in Shanghai and Nanjing, Japan attacked Shanghai. We fought Japan in Shanghai. Japan is a world robber and it is difficult to guarantee that they will not come to attack Fujian. The Commander-in-Chief will soon go north with the advance troops. Although we are saying goodbye now, if something happens in Fujian, I can return within two or three days to live and die with everyone. (5th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Current Commentary</h3>
<h3>The American Naval Construction Plan and Japan's Control of the South Pacific Islands</h3>
<p>I. A Review of the Washington Conference</p>
<p>The situation in the Pacific is precarious. Relations between Japan and the United States are fluctuating, and the clouds of war are looming. The situation is serious. Just as the United States has begun to overcome its financial panic and is actively working to resolve all issues, its plans to build a new fleet have not been halted. Recently, it has even proposed to complete twenty destroyers, five light cruisers, four submarines, and one aircraft carrier before 1936. These are all permitted under the 1930 London Treaty to replace the United States' aging obsolete warships. In reality, although the United States has fourteen dreadnought battleships compared to Japan's ten, it would be difficult for the United States to take the offensive in a Pacific war due to the more than five thousand miles of sea travel, compared to Japan's coastal operations. As for heavy cruisers, there is no significant difference between the United States and Japan. Combining light cruisers, the United States has a total tonnage of 11,000 tons more, but its ships are older and it has five fewer. (Japan has 27 heavy and light cruisers, while the United States only has 22). The United States is clearly at a disadvantage. Japan has 72 submarines, which are larger in tonnage and have a stronger cruising range. They are especially convenient and well-equipped for operating in the ocean. Its submarine fleet can be called the best in the world. The United States also admits it is not as good. So what was the so-called 5:5:3 ratio at the Washington Conference? It was based on the total naval tonnage, with Britain and the United States being equal, and Japan only having six-tenths of that. The intention was to balance Britain and the United States so that Japan could not help but adopt a defensive posture. However, the situation in the Far East was not as tense as it is today. The United States' desire to develop East Asia was not as active as it is recently. Imperial Japan's monopolistic ambitions were also not as blatant and ferocious as they are today. Therefore, the United States adopted a defensive offense, achieving temporary equilibrium with Britain in exchange for world peace, by not continuing to build fortresses in the Philippines and Guam and not expanding its Asiatic fleet, in exchange for naval relaxation, and making Japan promise a ratio of 10 to 6, maintaining the US naval advantage.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, things changed and often went beyond expectations. After the London Treaty, the ratio of the Japanese navy to Britain and the United States had increased from 3:5 to 6.9:10. Cruisers and submarines were also on an equal footing. Therefore, it is difficult to maintain the balance in the Orient. The rift between Japan and the United States has deepened. Imperial Japan's desire to seize China has become even more urgent. The area where it began to seize by force was in the north, not the south. And under the banner of blocking the Soviet Union's "redization" and preventing China's national revolution, it first won the sympathy of Britain, so that the United States, although very angry, was also powerless. In the midst of great difficulty, the only thing it could do was to gather the Atlantic fleet and station it permanently in the Pacific to maintain its hegemony in the eastern Pacific, awaiting future opportunities and responding to current emergencies. It is difficult to establish close links with the Philippines, which is six thousand nautical miles away, and Guam, which is placed at Japan's doorstep, so for the time being, we will leave them to be taken care of after the naval construction plan is realized.</p>
<p>II. Japan Occupies the South Pacific Islands and Expands Its Military Dominance</p>
<p>Since the United States is so far away from the Philippines, it cannot help but turn to strengthening its foundations, building Pearl Harbor as a base in the Pacific, and forming a strategic triangle with San Diego and San Francisco. To determine its conservative advantage, so that the enemy country Japan cannot take any active action in the eastern Pacific. However, modern warfare technology is advancing rapidly. The activity of the flying corps is particularly characteristic. The United States must overcome its weakness in its Far East military base outside the Philippines and Guam. It must find another way out. What is its way out? The activation of Alaska. At the northernmost corner, a strong naval base cannot be established, and ice and cold hinder fleet actions, which is inconvenient, but the construction of seaplane airfields does not require much effort, and it is more convenient for attacking Japan than Guam. However, the effective bombs loaded by child-sized explosive planes should not exceed 1,000 kilometers of continuous flight. However, as flight technology improves day by day and the range of performance gradually increases, the threat of the Alaskan airfield to Japan is no less than that of Guam.</p>
<p>At this moment, Japan is constrained by Guam in the south and threatened by Alaska in the north, and it cannot help but plan in advance. Its first move is to enrich the content of its navy, with the aim of seizing Manila and breaking Guam in the shortest possible time after the outbreak of war between Japan and the United States, so that the US fleet has no foothold when it comes west, and Japan can instead achieve a cutting effect. Therefore, Japan's previous naval operations plan was to form an arc along the Ogasawara Islands, the Ryukyu Islands, and Taiwan to maintain absolute control over the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. Now it is considered insufficient. Its first line will extend along the Ogasawara Islands to the Mariana Islands and end at the Palau Islands. By taking Guam, the Philippines will fall into its grasp, and it can also keep a close watch on Hawaii and peep into "Golden Gate." Therefore, it must strongly argue for self-defense, saying: "The rule of the South Pacific Islands is the lifeline of Japan's national defense." From a military point of view, Japan has made various strong military defenses. Although its strength may not be as good as Manila, its support is better than Guam. Furthermore, the response from the naval bases Yokosuka and Kure is extremely convenient. Japan can roam freely in the Western Pacific. The Far East market can be monopolized by Japan. The development of this situation has become more and more urgent recently. However, from a general economic and political point of view, neither Japan nor the United States can challenge alone or respond to war alone. Therefore, there is only rapid preparation of military strength and adding explosives to the powder magazine. As for what event will ignite the fire, it depends on how new facts unfold.</p>
<p>The Central Political Conference made a decision.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Appointed as Governor of the Central Bank</h3>
<p>Law Amending "Liang" to "Yuan" to Take Effect on April 6th</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council held its 351st meeting on the morning of the 5th. Attendees included Yu Youren, Wang Zhaoming, Sun Ke, Chen Guofu, Ye Chucang, Li Shizeng, Zhang Renjie, Wu Jingheng, Lin Sen, Zhang Ji, Shi Ying, Song Ziwen, Chen Gongbo, Zhu Jiahua, Zhou Qigang, and over thirty other individuals. Yu Youren chaired the meeting. The following matters were discussed: (1) Drafting the Organic Law and Election Law for the National Assembly, which was submitted to the Constitution Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan to draft basic principles and present them to the Council for approval. (2) Revising the Draft Law on the Appointment of County Magistrates, which was submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. (3) Approving the Organizational Regulations of the Administrative Regulations Consolidation Committee. (4) The case of the National Salvation Donation in Hunan Province was submitted to the Finance, Military, and Legal Affairs Groups for expedited review. Before the review, the Party, government, and military organs in Hunan should be notified by telegram to suspend the activities. (5) Minister of Finance Song Ziwen requested to resign from his concurrent position as Governor of the Central Bank, which was approved. Kong Xiangxi, a director of the bank, was appointed as the new Governor. (6) It was resolved to establish a special court for punishing corruption. (7) Regarding the amendment of "Liang" to "Yuan," it was resolved that, starting from April 6th of this year, all public and private receipts and payments should be made in silver yuan. Calculations using silver taels would have no legal effect. A tax of 2.25% would be levied on all exports of coinage materials. (Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the 351st meeting of the Central Political Council on the 5th, the case of amending "Liang" to "Yuan" was raised by Song Ziwen on an ad hoc basis. He also drafted the measures, and it was resolved to adopt the proposed measures. The original text of the proposal is as follows: (1) Regarding the proposal: The conversion rate between silver taels and silver coins was previously drafted, submitted for approval, and promulgated, and implemented in Shanghai from March 10th. It is now proposed that, starting from April 6th, all public and private payments and receipts, and all transactions, must be made in silver coins and no longer in silver taels. For those originally stipulated to be paid and received in silver taels before that date, the standard of 7 qian 1 fen 5 li of treasury silver per silver dollar should be used, and all payments and receipts should be made in silver coins. If any disputes arise, the judicial organs should reject requests to pay or receive in silver taels. New contracts, bills, and all transactions, as well as public and private receipts and payments made after that date that still use silver taels, shall be legally invalid. If the accounting books of various agencies still show receipts and payments in silver taels after that date, the Audit Department shall not approve them. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Control Yuan be instructed to circulate this information to their subordinates for compliance, to ensure uniformity and facilitate progress. Whether it is appropriate is submitted for public decision. (2) Regarding the proposal: All public and private receipts and payments, and all transactions, are scheduled to uniformly switch to silver coins starting from April 6th, and silver taels are no longer allowed. In order to facilitate the circulation of silver coins, it is proposed that, starting from April 6th, except for the Central Mint, all silver-based materials that can be used for minting coins and are transported for export will be taxed at 2.25% to show restrictions and protect coinage materials. Whether it is appropriate is submitted for public decision. (Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>The Dispute Between Kang and Tibet is Gradually Subsiding</h3>
<p>The Panchen Lama's Entry into Tibet is No Longer a Problem</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to information from the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, the dispute between Kang (Eastern Tibet) and Tibet is gradually subsiding. The 24th Army was previously telegraphed to inquire about the truth. According to the reply, the rumors were mostly inaccurate. The Tibetan army had previously planned to invade the Ningjing County area in Xikang (Western Sichuan), but there have been no large-scale military actions. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama are actively seeking to eliminate their differences. The Panchen Lama sent Anqin to Tibet as an advance party. The Panchen Lama's entry into Tibet should no longer be a problem. (Central News Agency, 5th)</p>

<h3>The Incident of the British Crew of the Nanchang Being Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Japanese Personnel Sent to the Bandit Lair to Negotiate</p>
<p>Niuzhuang: The authorities responsible for rescuing the kidnapped crew of the Nanchang have received a letter from the bandits demanding a huge ransom to be paid by April 10th, or the hostages will be shot. For the safety of the three British crew members, the authorities dare not send troops to suppress the bandits. The bandit letter was brought by Pearce, the fourth-class crew member who was released. The letter did not specify how to send a reply. The signatories are not well-known individuals. Pearce's release was solely for the purpose of delivering the letter demanding the ransom. Pearce could not specify the location where his companions are being held. A Japanese official, who is assisting the British Consul in handling the case, is now planning to send someone to the bandit lair to negotiate. This person is the same mediator who rescued Mrs. Bowles and Kirkland last autumn. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Niuzhuang: The local authorities here are making every effort to communicate with the bandits who kidnapped the three crew members of the Nanchang, but so far they have not been able to contact the bandits or the kidnapped individuals. It is believed that the three kidnapped crew members are still being held on civilian boats. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<h3>Zheng Luosheng and Others Advocate Expanding the Powers of the Control Yuan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Members of the Control Yuan, Li Menggeng, Zheng Luosheng, and others advocate expanding the scope of the Control Yuan's powers. They believe that officials who violate the law should be warned and questioned at any time. If the Control Yuan members believe that an official has violated the law in a certain matter, they should: 1. Directly issue a warning; 2. If the illegal conduct continues after the warning, directly question the official, ordering them to state their sincere intention to repent; 3. If direct warnings and questioning are ineffective, they should immediately file an impeachment and submit it for disciplinary action. When it is necessary in fact, the Control Yuan may directly implement disciplinary action to give the law-breaking officials a chance to reform. The Control Yuan can thus fulfill its proactive function of correcting law-breaking officials. The above opinions have now been submitted to the Constitution Drafting Committee for incorporation into the powers and responsibilities of the Control Yuan in the Constitution.

<h3>The National Government Decides to Abolish the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement</h3>
<p>And Sets Forth Three Measures for Levying Taxes After the Expiration Date</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Sino-Japanese Reciprocal Tariff Agreement, which is due to expire on May 15th of this year, the National Government has decided to abolish it and has set forth three measures for levying taxes after the expiration date: 1. To revise all current tariff rates; 2. To revise the tariff rates for commodities stipulated in the agreement and make special provisions; 3. Certain items will be taxed according to China's current import tariff rates. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>The Constitutional Drafting Committee Will Discuss the Issue of Balanced Powers Today</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Constitutional Drafting Committee is scheduled to discuss the issue of balanced powers between the central and local governments on the 6th, based in principle on Sun Yat-sen's National Reconstruction Program. However, the delineation of powers, whether by enumeration or general description, still needs to be studied. Although the organization and powers of the National Assembly, which were discussed last week, have been largely decided, it is reported that several points still need to be considered further, such as: 1. Whether to use a direct election system or an indirect election system for electing the President, the heads of the Five Yuan, and the members of the Legislative and Control Yuan. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. If direct elections are held, it is doubtful whether the majority of the population, with their limited knowledge, can exercise their right to vote without being exploited by the cunning. If indirect elections are held, it is difficult to determine whether the corrupt practices of manipulation or bribery can be avoided. 2. The National Assembly is the highest political body. If its powers are specified by enumeration, it would restrict the powers of the National Assembly. Furthermore, assuming that each county or equivalent area elects one representative, if the administrative regions of our country are counted, there would be nearly 2,000 representatives attending, making it difficult to focus opinions during discussions. 3. From the perspective of administrative regions, it seems fair to elect one representative from each county or equivalent area. However, considering the population density ratio, it seems unfair.

<h3>The National Salvation Loan in Hunan is Ordered to be Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>The Central Political Council Resolves to Submit to Review First</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council discussed the case of the Hunan Provincial Government's proposed 5 million yuan National Salvation Loan on the 5th and has submitted it to the Military, Political, Financial, and Legal Affairs Groups for review. According to reporters' inquiries, the amount of the loan is so large that it must be resolved by the Central Political Council and passed by the Legislative Yuan before it can be implemented. The regulations for the use of the loan exceed the authority of the provincial government, and the restrictions on payments are extremely severe. There are concerns that in the name of saving the country, it will be difficult to achieve the reality of saving the country and will only increase the suffering of the people. Moreover, Hunan Province already has a large amount of special taxes, salt tax surcharges, and land tax surcharges, which are several times or even dozens of times higher than those of other provinces, which is sufficient to cover military and administrative expenses. Therefore, after discussion, it was decided to submit it for review first in order to remedy the situation. At the same time, the Central Government ordered the Executive Yuan to send telegrams separately to the Hunan Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government, instructing that no action be taken on the above matters before the review and resolution.

<h3>Li Shizeng Discusses His Trip to Europe</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee Member Li Shizeng, who traveled to Europe last year, returned to Shanghai recently and arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 5th. He went to the Central Party Headquarters to participate in the Central Political Council meeting. After the meeting, he spoke to reporters about his trip to Europe, saying that he had lived abroad for thirty years and had become accustomed to it. In the last ten years, he has lived in China, and going to Europe every four or five years has become a special situation in his life. The general reason for this trip to Europe was simply to return to his normal life. Secondly, there were also temporary reasons, namely to attend the meetings of the World Committee on Intellectual Cooperation and the World New Education Fellowship. Regarding the Sino-Japanese issue, the League of Nations has imposed spiritual sanctions on violent Japan. In the future, economic or military sanctions against Japan are also possible. Whether this can be done depends on the European political situation. I am not pessimistic about the Sino-Japanese dispute and firmly believe that Japan will eventually fail. From a philosophical point of view, the arrogant and unreasonable will eventually fail, and the peaceful will eventually win the final victory. There are countless precedents. From the perspective of international trends, although China faces many difficulties, it can still maintain itself, while Japan shows signs of rupture everywhere. After Japan plundered our four provinces, its bonds fell daily, while our national bonds are stable and on the rise. Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations and still wants to hold on to the South Pacific mandated territories without fulfilling its obligations, only enjoying rights. Although countries are in a time of many troubles, I firmly believe that one day they will come out and impose sanctions. However, I say that China will win the final victory, and its significance is not limited to this. On the one hand, we must stabilize internal unity, and on the other hand, we must prepare for long-term resistance against Japan. (Central News Agency, 5th)</p>

<h3>Inevitable Collapse of the Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>Finance Minister Takahashi's Resignation Intent Firm</p>
<p>Intense Internal Strife Between Zaibatsu and Military</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Jiji Press) - Prime Minister Saito met with Finance Minister Takahashi on the morning of the 4th and made every effort to retain him. However, the Finance Minister's intention to resign is unwavering. There is a prevailing view within the government that a successor to the Finance Minister should be chosen and the cabinet reshuffled to prolong the current cabinet's life. However, the issue is not limited to the Finance Minister's resignation. Justice Minister Oyama is also deemed responsible for the "Red Peril" issue within the Ministry of Justice and intends to resign. In that case, the Prime Minister will inevitably bear joint responsibility, making a complete cabinet resignation unavoidable; it is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (China United Press) - Finance Minister Takahashi, to fulfill his private agreement with Suzuki in the Diet, has finally firmly refused repeated urging from Prime Minister Saito and is determined to resign alone. Therefore, changes in the Japanese political situation are unavoidable. The political focus is gradually shifting to the question of the next cabinet. Suzuki, Hiranuma, and Uchida are all being considered as candidates for the next Prime Minister. In Japan, which is under the control of military factions, no cabinet can be realized without the consent of the military. However, elders and financial circles deeply hope that the government will take the opportunity to ease its policy towards China to prevent financial chaos. Military factions, on the other hand, advocate implementing a continental policy. Given such divergent trends between the two factions, who will win the next cabinet position depends solely on the future trends of the two factions.</p>
<h3>Araki Plans to Retain Finance Minister</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (China United Press) - Regarding the resignation of Finance Minister Takahashi, the military initially adopted a wait-and-see attitude, hoping to realize military rule. However, financial and political circles not only expressed dissatisfaction with the military's arbitrary policies but also held pessimistic views about the future of Sino-Japanese relations. As the domestic situation also ran contrary to the military's expectations, the military changed its policy to prevent the Finance Minister from stepping down. While Takahashi was in office, there were slight differences with the military regarding financial resources and tax policies, but he generously provided the necessary funds. It is feared that it would be difficult to find a better puppet than Takahashi, except for the military forming its own military cabinet. It is heard that opposition to a coup within the Army Ministry is growing, and there is also widespread advocacy within financial circles for seeking an early compromise with China to save the precarious economic situation. The Seiyukai party is also secretly colluding in this effort. This environment further encourages Araki's faction to support the current cabinet. It is reported that Army Minister Araki will personally visit Takahashi within the next few days to express the military's sincerity and make every effort to retain him.</p>
<h3>Minseito Party Supports Current Cabinet</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Dentsu) - The Minseito Party attaches great importance to the future of the political situation and hopes for a flawless countermeasure. As things stand, it is feared that the Finance Minister's withdrawal of his resignation will be very difficult. It is believed that the Finance Minister's resignation will take place after the local governors' conference and around the time of the "May 15th Incident" resolution. However, Prime Minister Saito, encouraged by Prince Saionji, is determined to remain in the cabinet. Therefore, even if the Finance Minister resigns, he will be replaced, and Justice Minister Oyama's resignation will only lead to a partial cabinet reshuffle, so there will be no complete resignation. The Minseito Party will ultimately maintain the current cabinet. Therefore, Secretary-General Matsuda visited Prime Minister Oyama's private residence this morning to hear the truth about the political situation and its impact on the cabinet, and to exchange various opinions. Therefore, in order to overcome the extraordinary situation, the Minseito Party is determined to proceed with the policy of vigorously maintaining the current cabinet and to urge Prime Minister Saito to handle the situation well.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Establishes Advisory Council</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Jiji Press) - Foreign Minister Uchida, having withdrawn from the League of Nations, feels the need to resolve the issue of establishing a research department within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as soon as possible. It has now been decided to first establish a Foreign Affairs Advisory Council as an affiliated body to the research department. The Foreign Minister will appoint five people with rich diplomatic experience to advise on important foreign policy matters. This plan will require the consent of the Privy Council and will be implemented once approved. The members will be selected from among the following: Privy Council officials Kijuro Shidehara, Kenkichi Yoshizawa, Kageaki Okabe, Inazo Nitobe, and scholars Kazuo Matsubara, Ritsutaro Tachi, and Jumpei Shinobu.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Russian Relations Endangered</h3>
<p>British Government Publishes Negotiation Process</p>
<p>Motion to Boycott Russian Goods Submitted to House of Commons</p>
<p>Russia Grants Bail to Three British Engineers</p>
<p>London, 4th (Reuters) - The British authorities today published a white paper disclosing documents reported to the British Foreign Office by British Ambassador to Russia, Sir Esmond Ovey, after six British engineers from the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company were detained on March 12th. All six detainees, except Macdonald, have been temporarily released, each on bail of 50,000 rubles. However, Russian employees who were detained are not allowed to be released on bail. British engineer Monkhouse was interrogated for nineteen hours. Monkhouse admitted that he had reported the business situation to the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company based on reports from various engineers. The interrogator then accused this as a criminal act of private investigation. Monkhouse also admitted that 21 percent of the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company's turbines were unsuitable for use, because the Russians were unwilling to use standard machines. The Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company is now quickly taking steps to correct various defects. British Ambassador Ovey reported to the Foreign Office on March 14th that he had visited engineers Thornton and Gregory in prison, stating, "The two engineers have clearly suffered greatly and are in unspeakable pain." On March 16th, the British Ambassador reported to the Foreign Office about his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov. At that time, the British Ambassador stated that this was not a matter of sovereignty but a matter of whether British people could reside and do business in Russia. Litvinov replied that strong words would not have the slightest effect on the Soviet government. As the meeting was drawing to a close, the British Ambassador stated that Russia was deliberately destroying Anglo-Russian relations, and he was extremely disappointed. He had initiated Anglo-Russian relations, and now, unfortunately, it seemed that he would be the one to end them.</p>
<p>London, 4th (Reuters) - The British government submitted a motion to the House of Commons to ban the import of Russian goods. The text is quite brief, with only four clauses. It proposes that the government ban the import of all goods produced or manufactured by the Soviet Union by order. This motion will take effect on April 18th and will not apply to transit goods. The motion stipulates that goods manufactured partly in Russia and partly elsewhere will be regarded as Russian goods unless it can be proven that the goods were made elsewhere after leaving Russia and that at least a quarter of their value was created elsewhere. The motion also contains remedies for failure to fulfill contracts due to the declaration of the ban. The motion authorizes the Board of Trade to issue special licenses for the import of prohibited goods. After the second reading of the motion, opposition leader Cripps moved to dismiss the motion tonight, saying that the white paper had not shown sufficient reason for the British government to demand the unconditional release of the arrested persons, nor had it shown sufficient reason for the British government to obtain the special powers proposed in the motion for the sake of retaliation against Russia.</p>
<p>Moscow, 5th (Guomin News Agency) - Today, after the government prosecutor formally read out the indictment of the British engineers of the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company, he allowed Thornton, Cushny, and Gregory to be released on bail, with a total bail of 55,000 rubles. Macdonald was not granted bail by the prosecutor. According to the indictment, Thornton is accused of military and economic espionage, sabotage, and bribery. Cushny and Gregory are accused of organizing sabotage activities and carrying out sabotage orders, respectively, in addition to military and economic espionage. However, all four deny the charges, saying that their arrests were based on fabricated charges. The white paper published by the British government has been received here, but officials have not had enough time to study it fully, so no comments have been made yet. Newspapers have published diplomatic talks between the British Ambassador and the Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs, which were sometimes quite intense. Therefore, the British Ambassador returned to London, and the white paper was based on his personal report.</p>

They also discussed France's memorandum on the Four-Power Pact and the Disarmament Conference. Davies plans to meet with French Prime Minister Daladier tomorrow and will stay in Paris for about two weeks before flying to Berlin to liaise with the German government on everything.</p>
<p>Paris, 5th (Havas) - Prime Minister Daladier received Davis, the chief U.S. representative to the Disarmament Conference, at 12:45.</p>
<p>London, 5th (Guomin News Agency) - Today, the Associated Press learned from the most reliable sources that British Prime Minister MacDonald is planning to leave for the United States within the next week and stay in Washington for several days. It has been known that the British Prime Minister is considering going to the United States to personally discuss the war debt issue with the U.S. President, but it was not expected that his departure would be so soon. When British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay returned home in early February, it was said that Roosevelt had entrusted him with personally inviting MacDonald to the United States, which was one of the motivations for this action. However, this statement has not been formally confirmed. When Lindsay arrived in London, he reported to the cabinet on his talks with Stimson and Roosevelt. The British government then formed a special cabinet committee to draft a war debt proposal to be sent to Washington. It is now believed that Lindsay must have strongly urged MacDonald to personally visit the United States, so that this thorny issue could be discussed directly by the leaders, which would hopefully make it easier to resolve. In 1929, British Prime Minister MacDonald visited the United States and was warmly welcomed by the Americans, which aroused feelings of goodwill among the British towards the United States. At the same time, it also gave the Americans a good impression, and as a result, Anglo-American relations greatly improved.</p>

<h3>Rescued Naval Lieutenant Commander Reports Details of U.S. Airship Disaster</h3>
<p>Flying at 16,000 Feet Through Severe Storms</p>
<p>Forced to Land on the Sea Surrounded by Lightning at Midnight</p>
<p>Airship Body Could Not Withstand the Impact of Huge Waves and Instantly Shattered</p>
<p>Seventy-Three Killed, Including Chief of Naval Aviation Bureau</p>
<p>New York, 4th (Reuters) - Naval Lieutenant Commander Wiley sent a wireless message reporting the details of the airship Akron's disaster on the night of April 3rd between 10:00 PM and midnight. Wiley was one of the three survivors, initially rescued by the German ship "Phoebus" and then boarded the Coast Guard ship "Carter". The telegram was sent by the "Tucker". This is the first official report received, stating that the Akron was surrounded by lightning at 10:00 PM last night while flying at an altitude of 16,000 feet through severe storms, constantly changing direction. It then began to descend at midnight. Half an hour later, it released its ballast sandbags. The Akron was still surrounded by lightning, and the turbulence was severe. As it descended, the stern was downwards. Suddenly, the rudder was lost, and the ship struck the water surface, instantly breaking apart. The sea was illuminated by constant flashes of lightning, which was terrifying. At first, people were seen swimming desperately among the wreckage of the airship. In an instant, they all disappeared. Before the destruction, the cockpit was completely calm, with no sign of panic.</p>
<p>Only Three Survivors Out of Seventy-Six Aboard. It is now known that there were nineteen officers and fifty-seven enlisted crew members on board the Akron. Only five have been located. Four were rescued by the German ship "Phoebus", but one died shortly after. Another was Naval Lieutenant Commander McClelland, whose body was recovered today. The three survivors are Naval Lieutenant Commander Wiley, crew members Deal and Owen. Naval Executive Officer Kepner was rescued but later died on the "Phoebus". The Naval patrol ship "Tucker" has transported the three survivors ashore today. They all refused to talk, but Wiley, wearing a tightly fitted military uniform, mumbled, "I am fine." Deal was taken to the hospital on a stretcher after landing. He was also rescued during the crash of the U.S. Navy airship Shenandoah in 1925. Multiple ships are still searching for the victims among the wreckage of the Akron floating on the sea surface, but the rain and fog are making it very difficult. The location of the Akron's disaster is about twenty miles from the Barnegat Lightship.</p>
<p>Two of the Three Airships Have Now Been Lost. According to general opinion, the Akron's disaster has dealt a fatal blow to airships. From now on, it is feared that no one will promote airships for commercial or military use. Vincent, the chairman of the committee investigating the Akron's disaster, declared that no more airships would be built in the future. The United States built a total of three airships, two of which have been lost. The United States spent a total of US$20 million to build these airships, and the Shenandoah and now the Akron have been destroyed. Only one airship remains, named Macon. Naval Secretary Swanson said today that he had never been as enthusiastic about airships as others, and also said that the Akron's sister ship, the Macon, would be sent to the West Coast to cooperate with the fleet as originally planned. One of the most prominent victims of the Akron's disaster was Rear Admiral Moffett, Chief of the Naval Bureau of Aeronautics. The January 1932 issue of the National Aeronautics Monthly published an article by the admiral about the Akron, stating that although the Akron was overweight, its navigation was not affected under normal circumstances. He also said that the reason for the increase in weight was due to orders from the Navy Department to make changes to improve its safety and military effectiveness.</p>
<p>Airship Drifts with the Waves, Body Seen Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>New York, 5th (Reuters) - Naval Lieutenant Commander Wiley, wearing hospital clothes, told a group of reporters today about the Akron's disaster. According to him, there was no sign of electric shock in the airship. There was no explosion or fire in the ship. As midnight approached, the airship began to descend rapidly. At that time, all the engines were running at full speed. He threw the heavy sandbags carried in the ship into the sea. The front of the ship lifted about eight hundred feet from the ground, then flew up again. It stabilized at about one thousand five hundred feet from the ground. Three minutes later, the air suddenly became turbulent, and the front of the ship rose sharply. He knew he was close to the center of a big storm and ordered everyone in the ship to prepare. The ship then tilted severely, and the control steel wire and the upper rudder were blown away by the wind. Wiley then tried to steer with the lower rudder. He moved to the right side of the control machine to steer, while the captain was on the left side to control the elevator. At that time, the front of the ship was inclined upwards by about twenty degrees, and the ship fell rapidly. Nothing could be seen outside the ship except for the thick fog. He asked what the altitude was, and the answer was three hundred feet. He then ordered everyone in the ship to prepare for the inevitable destruction. Everyone was very calm. But in an instant, the ship hit the water, and seawater poured in through the windows. He swam out of the ship quickly. When he reached the surface of the water, he saw the airship drifting away with the waves in the constant flashes of lightning. The front of the ship was facing the sky, and the body of the ship was completely destroyed. He then saw the lights of the "Phoebus". He desperately swam towards the ship and grabbed a plank, holding it and swimming. He heard shouts on the water. The "Phoebus" threw a rope into the water and pulled him on board, but the other people were farther away from the "Phoebus".</p>

<h3>Misfortunes Never Come Singly: Another Small Airship Crashes</h3>
<p>Lakehurst, 5th (Guomin News Agency) - After the U.S. Navy lost the airship Akron yesterday morning, losing Rear Admiral Moffett, Chief of the Naval Bureau of Aeronautics, and eighteen other officers and fifty-four soldiers, it was unexpected that misfortunes never come singly. Yesterday afternoon, a small airship designated "J-3" was searching for the wreckage of the Akron but failed. On the way back, it crashed into the sea about half a mile off Barnegat Beach in New Jersey and was completely destroyed. Two officers on board died instantly, and three are missing, presumed to have drowned in the sea. The other four were rescued. The Akron airship has apparently sunk to the bottom of the sea. Initially, the German oil tanker "Phoebus" searched first, and then more than ten American aircraft and American cruisers Portland and destroyers arrived. However, the missing generals and soldiers and the ship's body were not found in the mist. The search has now been stopped.</p>
<h3>U.S. President Grieves Over Loss of Talented Generals</h3>
<p>When the bad news spread, the whole country was shocked. The U.S. President stayed up all night yesterday, waiting for news of the search. When he saw that there was no hope of rescuing the missing people, he issued a declaration stating that this loss was a great disaster for the country. Airships can be rebuilt, but talented generals are hard to come by, which is deeply regrettable. Navy Secretary Swanson also issued a declaration, saying that the loss of Rear Admiral Moffett was a great loss for the Navy.</p>
<h3>Airship Policy Appears to Receive a Fatal Blow</h3>
<p>Currently, congressmen and the public are divided on whether the government should continue to use airships in the future. Most newspapers advocate that the government should follow the British example and at least temporarily disband the airship fleet and dismantle the airships. However, another group argues that a detailed investigation should be conducted before discussing it. Congressman Fish has proposed in the House of Representatives to form a committee to investigate the matter in detail. Navy Secretary Swanson stated that this was truly an unprecedented tragedy for the Navy in peacetime. However, it would be premature to decide the government's policy based on this one incident. He then assured that the government would investigate the use of airships as soon as possible. However, Swanson is currently seriously considering whether to abandon the policy of developing airships for at least the next few years, which is clearly known.</p>
<h3>Cause of the Disaster Cannot Be Speculated</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Guomin News Agency) - Since the accident of the U.S. airship Akron, German President Hindenburg and Chancellor Hitler have both telegraphed condolences to U.S. President Roosevelt, and German Aviation Minister Goering has also sent a condolence telegram to the U.S. Navy Department. German Zeppelin airship commander Eckener said in a statement on the U.S. airship accident that the information received is not yet complete, so the exact cause of the accident is difficult to speculate. However, he said that it is difficult to believe that the accident was caused by lightning in the air, because airships can usually travel in lightning at any time. It is also impossible to attribute the cause of the accident to electric shock. Fortunately, the airship commander Wiley was rescued. Wiley is an experienced airship pilot and will be able to tell the world the real cause of the accident based on his observations. In addition, after the Akron accident, the U.S. Navy's small airship J-7 also sank into the sea while searching for survivors at sea, causing the death of five people on board. This news is even more tragic. New York, 5th (Reuters) - According to a crew member rescued from the airship Akron, the airship was surrounded by electricity and seemed to split like a clam, but the reason for this is still uncertain. According to one expert, the Akron's accident was caused by flying in a direct current of air. Another person said that it must have been caused by an accident in the vortex of a strong wind. The Undersecretary of the Navy stated that the investigation would now determine whether lighter-than-air aircraft are beneficial to national defense.</p>
<h3>Coincidentally, French Airship Also Suffers Disaster</h3>
<p>Paris, 4th (Guomin News Agency) - Following the U.S. airship Akron, the French Navy airship E-9 also had an accident. The time of the accident was a few hours after the two U.S. airship accidents. The French airship had to descend sharply between Rochefort and La Rochelle today due to mechanical damage. Unexpectedly, when it touched the ground, it broke into two halves. The commander and an adjutant were seriously injured, while the other twelve people were slightly injured.</p>
<h3>Germany Lodges Protest with Russia</h3>
<p>Wording Exceptionally Strong</p>
<p>Saying No Other Country Is Allowed to Interfere in Internal Affairs</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Guomin News Agency) - Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov protested against the various mistreatments suffered by the Soviet people in Germany and the frequent searches of the Soviet commercial representative office in Germany by the German authorities. The German government has now drafted a reply to the Soviet protest, stating that such searches were unavoidable due to the discovery of a large number of suspicious documents. Furthermore, the German government says that no neighboring country is allowed to interfere in German internal affairs.</p>
<h3>Case of British Crew Kidnapped on the Nanchang Steamer</h3>
<p>Question Raised in British House of Commons</p>
<p>London, 5th (Reuters) - At today's meeting of the House of Commons, someone will ask Naval Minister Sir Bolton Eyres-Monsell whether he will consider providing armed protection to British ships traveling along the coast of China, given that the British crew of the Nanchang steamer were hijacked by bandits. The Daily Mail carried an editorial today, emphatically stating that the Nanchang case is just one of many similar cases, and hoping that the Naval Minister will agree to provide British ships with real protection in the future. If pirates cannot be wiped out, then the system of armed guards stationed on ships for protection must be restored, but personnel must be prepared to be deployed. The reappearance of pirates in the Far East is the unfortunate consequence of the recent large-scale reduction in the size of the British Navy.</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Yosuke Greatly Praises Ford</h3>
<p>Calling Him God</p>
<p>Grosse Pointe, Michigan, 5th (Havas) - Matsuoka Yosuke, the former chief representative of Japan to the League of Nations, in the capacity of an industrialist rather than an official representative of the Japanese government, had lunch with automobile magnate Henry Ford and Ford's son yesterday. Matsuoka praised Ford extensively, saying that the Japanese worship Ford like a God, and many Japanese children hope to become Ford one day. When discussing the possibility of boycotting Japan, Matsuoka said that none of the member states of the League of Nations would be so crazy as to engage in economic boycotts. He also said that Japan has not purchased arms from the United States. Japan can manufacture enough arms to meet its own domestic consumption and export them abroad. Matsuoka returned to Chicago by plane in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Honjo Rewarded for Meritorious Service in Invasion of China</h3>
<p>Appointed as Chief Aide-de-Camp</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (China United Press) - Lieutenant General Honjo Shigeru, the chief culprit in the September 18th Incident that harmed China, has been appointed as a military councillor since August of last year, after the internal division commanders were unwilling to obey his orders and due to changes in Japan's policy towards Manchuria, he resigned from the important post of commander of the Kwantung Army. Honjo is a strong general of the Araki faction. Although Araki tried his best to find a position for him in the active removal of the Choshu military clique's power, he was unable to find a vacant position. Now, due to the retirement of General Nara, the chief aide-de-camp to the Emperor, Lieutenant General Honjo was transferred to succeed him. According to the Araki faction, Honjo was meritorious in invading China and building the "State of Manchuria," so he was selected this time. The inauguration ceremony will be held on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Preparations for Japan's Total War Mobilization (Continuation 2)</h3>
<p>6.  Total Mobilization and Hypothetical Enemies</p>
<p>The national total mobilization plan targets the army and navy plans. Therefore, once the army and navy have a hypothetical enemy country, then total mobilization naturally also has a hypothetical enemy country.</p>
<p>7.  Which Country is Most Advanced in Mobilization Planning?</p>
<p>Which country does this belong to? This total mobilization plan is a task of maximizing national power and effectively unifying human and material resources. Therefore, all countries are conducting it very secretly. Thus, regarding its content, what has one country done, how far has one country progressed? This is impossible to know. Furthermore, to publish this is tantamount to publishing one's own war tactics. Therefore, no country is willing to publicly announce it. Only from the publicly announced part and from other aspects can we observe that they are indeed proceeding with it. However, among them, which country is the most advanced? In Europe, the most complete country is probably Italy. Italy uses the Total Mobilization Law as law, and France is the same.</p>
<p>Although the United States and France submitted the Total Mobilization Law to the parliament, neither passed it. However, Italy passed it. However, the one that can most effectively carry it out in wartime is the Soviet Union. The important point of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan is the manufacture of heavy industry, and the enrichment of national defense in five years is shortened to four years. Especially, the dictatorship of the proletariat restricts the daily life of the people everywhere. Taking clothing as an example, women in Moscow must wear clothes of one color. If the lives of the people are restricted and all the money is used in heavy industry, especially national defense facilities, the resulting war power is most effectively improved. Its content is the so-called Five-Year Plan. Recently, the Second Plan is underway, and there is no difference between peacetime and wartime, so it can be said that national total mobilization is underway. Moreover, its resources are abundant, the government has the power of control, and the people's endurance is also very strong.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's natural resources are abundant, and it has one-fifth of the world's territory, with a population of 160 million. The government also has absolute control, so its effect is very great. The first Five-Year Plan was shortened to four years. A few percentages of this Five-Year Plan were completely successful as expected. The Second Plan, which started at the beginning of 1933, will invest 14 billion or 15 billion rubles. In terms of industrial power alone, the 1937 budget will increase by two and a half billion over last year. From this, we can say that the Soviet Union is quite prepared for total mobilization.</p>
<p>Let's look at the situation in the world. Although Italy is said to be the most advanced in Europe, the Soviet Union can be regarded as the most advanced in terms of the actual situation of total mobilization. Its substantive cultivation of national power in terms of war preparation can be regarded as the first in the world. That is, the country with the most thorough preparation should recommend a country with autocratic politics. So what about Japan? There is only one thing to add, that is, empty plans on paper are useless. For a country like Japan with poor resources and weak industrial power, empty plans are useless. The first is to invest in revitalizing industrial power and national power. This is a peacetime facility on total mobilization. How far has this progressed? What has been the situation since Showa 2 (1927)? If you refer to the recent annual national budget, you can generally see it clearly. Substantive industrial military force like the Soviet Union is not being carried out much.</p>
<p>National total mobilization is most advanced in countries with autocratic politics. In Italy, there are dictators like Mussolini, and in the Soviet Union, there are dictators like Stalin. The Italians have the national character of an autocratic political party, while the Soviets have the national character of being able to endure autocratic politics for a long time, so total mobilization is easier to carry out. And Japan has also produced a strong government, and the spirit of Emperor Jimmu's founding of the country and the spirit of the imperial way are also burning. Once war breaks out, they can endure hardships and carry out their spirit to move forward courageously. Does Japan have this confidence now? This is a problem. Although there is a complete plan for total mobilization on paper, if there is no strong government, national thought and belief, and unified and united persistence, then total mobilization will only have its name without its reality. The result of national total mobilization is also a matter of national polity, especially ideological issues. Fundamentally, it seems to be turning into a state of spiritual total mobilization. Therefore, the military is misunderstood as praising autocracy. There is really no way to do this.</p>
<p>8. Cultivating Peacetime Industries</p>
<p>National total mobilization in peacetime is just a plan on paper. But if you move the plan on paper to peacetime facilities and hold facilities with wartime as the goal, this is also within the scope of total mobilization. And the total mobilization plan does not only target wartime facility plans, but also peacetime industrial cultivation must be taken into account at the same time. The investigation necessary for total mobilization is not only for war, but also to use this investigation in peacetime administration. Therefore, the total mobilization investigation has these two purposes. That is to say, total mobilization is not only for the army and navy in wartime, but also helps peacetime administration. In short, the wartime economy is similar to the controlled economy. The study of converting to a nationally controlled economic organization belongs to the study of total mobilization. That is to say, it is not possible to do it according to normal research. For example, when war broke out in Germany, it was necessary to investigate the amount of domestic raw materials and resources. The Statistics Bureau was anxious to obtain statistics on this issue, but did not get much. The Statistics Bureau had to spend six months to collect the statistics. In this way, it was too late. It must be used within two weeks at the latest. Therefore, at that time, an order was issued to conduct this investigation within two weeks for individuals who supply military supplies and for about a thousand companies. But as a result, the implementation of national total mobilization was delayed.</p>
<p>If the plan on paper is completed, once the actual period of national total mobilization comes, it will be based on the Military Industry Law. This law was promulgated on April 16 of the seventh year of the Taisho era (1918). Therefore, in law, the people must engage in war during wartime, and the government can requisition personnel who can work in factories and businesses. This is moved to the aspect of industrial mobilization. In Japan, the Industrial Mobilization Law was produced as early as the seventh year of Taisho (1918), so the preparation for industrial mobilization has been carried out for more than ten years. From then on, the government can freely use factories and businesses, and can requisition personnel. Therefore, the government can freely manufacture military supplies. The Industrial Mobilization Law also stipulates the protection and encouragement of military industries, and subdivides more than 20 articles of law. Therefore, it is possible to activate and implement military industrial mobilization in a fairly wide range. (End of this article)</p>
<h3>Japan Seizes 3,000 Kilometers of Railways in Our Northeast</h3>
<p>Construction Cost 180 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Annual Income 15 Million</p>
<p>South Manchuria Railway Company's Proud Report in the Diet</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence: The South Manchuria Railway Company's capital increase proposal, in the 64th Japanese Diet, especially in the upper house, blamed the company for mismanagement and huge losses. However, the Manchuria Railway Company replied that after the September 18th Incident, the responsibility of the Manchuria Railway became increasingly heavy. All the original Chinese railways have been owned by Japan. The delegation contract recently signed with "Manchukuo" is actually a legal formality. The profits obtained are more than 15 million yuan in net profit per year. The routes obtained include the Jilin Changchun Line, the Jilin Dunhua Line, the Sipingjie Taonan Line, the Zhengjiatun Tongliao Line, the Taonan Angangxi Line, the Qiqihartu Keshun Line, the Taoan Wangzimiao Line, the Machuankou Hailun Line, the Songpu Road Taizi Line, the Shenyang Chaoyang Line, the Shahe Xi'an Line, the Jilin Chaoyang Line, the Shanhaiguan Shenyang Line, the Lianshan Huludao Line, the Goubangzi Yingkou Line, the Jin County Beipiao Line, and the Dahushan Tongliao Line. There are a total of 17 routes, with a total length of 2,932.5 kilometers, a construction cost of 183,192,000 yuan, and a net profit of 15,318,800 yuan in 1931. The income of each route is increasing day by day. Here are the main points of the report submitted by the Manchuria Railway Company to the 64th Diet. The contents are as follows:</p>

<h3>Hunan Provincial Aircraft Arrives in Guangzhou for Mission</h3>
<p>Commanded to Discuss Anti-Japanese and Communist Suppression Matters Together</p>
<p>Smoothly Inspect and Accept Purchased Aircraft Materials</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Hunan Provincial Government recently sent the Raon aircraft to Guangzhou, driven by Aviation Team Captain Yan Duzhou and Deputy Team Commander Zhou Yijun, to negotiate and liaise with the Guangdong authorities on matters related to assisting in suppressing the Jiangxi bandits and supporting the Rehe affairs. Prior to this, He Jian telegraphed Huang Guangrui, commander of the Guangdong Air Force, requesting assistance in contacting them. Yan and Zhou took off from Changsha at 8:30 a.m. on March 30th, landed once in Hengzhou on the way, and continued south. They arrived in the suburbs of Guangzhou at 4:45 p.m. that afternoon. The Guangdong Air Force immediately sent personnel to greet them. After Yan and Zhou visited Air Force Commander Huang Guangrui, they stayed at the White Palace Hotel that night. It is learned that Yan and Zhou have been serving in the Hunan aviation field for many years. Zhou is a graduate of the third class of the Guangdong Aviation School. According to them, in addition to being commanded to discuss various major plans with the Guangdong authorities, they also came to Guangzhou to receive aircraft materials. Because aircraft supplies are not easy to purchase in Hunan, the Chairman of Hunan telegraphed Commander Huang some time ago, entrusting him to purchase them from foreign merchants in Guangdong. Recently, he received a telegram from Commander Huang, informing him that the machines purchased on behalf of Hunan have been transported to Guangdong. Therefore, Chairman He sent his brothers to Guangzhou to inspect and accept them. As the national crisis is increasingly urgent in Hunan Province, and three provinces have been lost, we have implemented the fundraising of 5 million yuan in national salvation loans. Half of it is deducted from the salaries of officials and staff by 20%, and the other half is levied from the property field deed tax. The purpose of this 5 million yuan is to use part of it as temporary expenses for anti-Japanese troops, part of it to complete the telephone network and set up a motorcade throughout the province, and part of it is allocated to expand the air force. Our provincial air force now has the necessity to expand. Our Aviation Director Huang Fei will personally go to Guangdong this month to discuss the expansion of aviation with Commander Huang and others. In addition, the Hunan Raon aircraft that came to Guangzhou this time is a monoplane with a high speed. Yan and Zhou will return to Hunan to report after inspecting and transferring the purchased machines back to Hunan. (April 1)</p>
<h3>Anhui People Oppose Diverting the Yellow River into the Huai River</h3>
<p>Gong Xinzhan and Others Put Forward Reasons for Opposition</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The Henan authorities believe that the Yellow River has been flooding for years and is the source of water worries. They plan to join the Flood Relief Committee of the Construction Department to divert the Yellow River into the Huai River and then into the Yangtze River. However, the Anhui people have risen up in opposition, and the voices are very high. The people of northern Anhui who live in the Huai River Basin are particularly opposed. Gong Xinzhan, Wang Yitang, Wang Pu, etc., in addition to writing to Chairman Wu Zhongxin of Anhui to try to recover, have recently written to fellow villagers, asking them to make strong arguments in unison. The reasons for their opposition are roughly as follows: "Since the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, the Yellow River has seized the mouth of the Huai River into the sea, and the Huai River has been forced to enter the Yangtze River. When the Yellow River returns to the north, the mouth of the Huai River into the sea is silted up, and the road to the sea is cut off. The entire Huai River suffers, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River also suffer. In addition, the mountainous fields are vast in the Sichuan and Shaanxi areas, and the silt and gravel all enter the Yangtze River. The ships come and go like shuttles, dumping coal slag, and accumulating over time. Therefore, the bottom of the river is shallow, the river islands are wide, and the river surface is narrow. The lakes in the upper reaches, such as Dongting and Poyang, which used to divert the great flow of the Yangtze River, are now almost half silted up. Every time the river rises, the embankments along the river are swept away, and the towns suffer even more. In the disaster of the previous year, Hanbu almost sank, and boats sailed through the streets of Wuhu. The capital was heavily guarded underground, and the ocean was almost everywhere. Even the lower streets and alleys of the city were heard to use boats to help people. The people who worry about the times, with their long-term considerations, have the idea of dredging the Yangtze River. In fact, the construction cost is too great to start. Compared with guiding the Huai River into the sea, it is even more difficult to repay the wish. Now this disaster has not been eliminated, and the Yellow River will be introduced into the Anhui Huai River to reach the river. It is estimated that the silt will rush and inject ten times from the past. The area of the natural moat will become a ditch. The southeastern financial state, the fundamental place along the river, what kind of scene is it? It can be imagined. Since the capital moved south, the one that relies on controlling the north is the Jinpu Railway. Xuzhou is the central hub of Jinpu and controls the key of Longhai. It is vertical and horizontal, and the situation is especially majestic. However, the railway runs from Xu to the south, straddling both sides of the north and south banks of the Huai River. Between these two or three hundred miles, the terrain is flat. In the past, when the Huai River rose, only a line of tracks was left floating on it. The car travels on it, like Lianfan crossing the sea, which is already precarious. If you add a torrential Yellow River, the turbulent and vast waters will inevitably submerge the tracks. The area of Xufang is already sighing. To the provinces of Yan and Qi, the important areas of Shaanxi and Luo, what is the voice of the capital used to connect? Speaking of this, I feel shuddering. The flood rushed and injected, and the area under the Huaiyang River became the bottom of the pot. The close proximity to Qianli, the displaced people gathered, and the north and south were isolated. How can it be endured? " (April 3)</p>
<h3>The Depression of Various Industries in Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Since Su Province was affected by the floods in Jiangbei in the 20s, followed by the Battle of Shanghai in the spring of the 21st year, Zhenjiang, where the provincial capital is located, has been increasingly depressed in various industries. Here is a summary of its current situation.</p>
<p>In previous years, the silk cloth business was exceptionally developed. Recently, due to the exhaustion of the social economy and the weak purchasing power of the people, there are few patrons. Although the shops are equipped with radio receivers to attract customers, the effect is almost zero. Therefore, industries such as silk cloth and foreign goods have to resort to price reductions and auctions.</p>
<p>Gold industry: Since the price of gold has risen sharply, there are more exchangers and fewer buyers of gold. The shops use the manufacture of badges and silver shields as a side business, but the price of goods is huge, and those with strong capital are not enough to cope with it.</p>
<p>Money industry: This year, the abolition of taels and the conversion to yuan were implemented, and the account books were extremely small. The price of foreign cents and other prices did not fluctuate much every day, but only maintained the residual situation.</p>
<p>Groceries: All rely on foreign cargo from other ports. At this moment, the harvest in various places under the river has been reduced, so the number of wholesale cargo customers has decreased by 40% to 50% compared with previous years.</p>
<p>Shipping industry: In addition to the original nine companies, new companies are emerging one after another, competing for business with each other. There is a danger of bankruptcy in the future.</p>
<p>Rice industry: Last year, the grain was cheap, and rice merchants complained. There has been no improvement this spring. If the rice market recovers, there may be hope of revival.</p>
<p>Transportation: Affected by the depression of various industries, there are fewer transporters. Small companies are complaining incessantly, and large companies are losing money.</p>
<p>Paper industry: Although the gold pound has risen sharply, the import is used to offset the gold price in foreign bits, so the hidden loss is huge.</p>
<p>Porcelain: Because goods from Jiangxi do not surge, and it is not convenient to raise the price for sale, the business is also deserted. (April 5)</p>

<h3>Vice President Niu's Visit to Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Songwei Road cannot directly pass through because the Weiqiao has not yet been built, and the car must be changed at Weiqiao. Now the company is hiring workers to rush to build it within a time limit for the convenience of passengers, and it has recently been completed. Today (5th), Niu Yongjian, Vice President of the Examination Yuan, drove his own car No. 12961 directly from Shanghai to Songjiang at 10 am, and rested at Songhui Small Building. He returned to Shanghai at 1 pm. This is the first time for direct traffic. The passenger car will be able to drive directly from the 15th.</p>

<h3>The Ding Township Bandits Gather Again</h3>
<p>In the Xixiang Zhenntao area of Tongyi, the bandit atmosphere has recently revived. The bandit leader is Road Blind. A group of more than 200 gathered, burned and robbed, and were very rampant. The Provincial Security Department ordered each county in Tai to notify the police to suppress them.</p>

<h3>Guangming Theater Violently Beats Children</h3>
<p>This year's 44th Children's Day was previously negotiated by the authorities and various theaters to show movies and give preferential treatment to children to decorate the festival. Therefore, the general innocent elementary school students all entered the venue to watch movies with the badges issued by various schools. However, Guangming Cinema in the park road in the city saw that there were many children and it was difficult to accommodate them. They even closed the iron gate and scolded the children. The children also did not show weakness, causing conflicts. Several elementary school students were beaten and injured. Sanbao, who was working in the Education Association, came forward to mediate, which also got involved in the vortex. He was taken into the first branch of the Public Security Bureau by the police on duty. Seeing this, the children were furious and rushed into the branch to demand the release of Sanbao. Later, Pan Yichen from the Central Elementary School District and others came out and tried their best to dissuade them. The children put forward three conditions: 1. Order the theater to open five venues throughout the day without charging admission fees. 2. Punish the murderers and treat the wounded. 3. Erect permanent souvenirs in the park. Gao Xikui, the manager of the hospital, said that he accepted it and released Sanbao. The children thought they had won and began to scatter.</p>
<h3>The Sock Industry Declines and Asks for Relief</h3>
<p>The sock factory industry in this county has more than 70 factories in the whole county. The prosperity of business and the precision of goods are the crown of all counties in the mainland. Since the beginning of this year's spring, the market has been depressed, and business has plummeted. Now there are mountains of stocks, and there is no sales channel at all. The factories have issued accounts, but due to the difficult social economy, it is difficult to collect them. And daily production has no sales channel, resulting in inflexible turnover. Yesterday, the industry association decided that each factory should strive to maintain it in order to overcome the difficulties of the times together. On the one hand, we asked the Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the Party and government to request relief to maintain it.</p>
<h3>No Additional Taxes May Be Levied in Each District</h3>
<p>The provincial government has recently ordered each county district office to collect additional taxes directly, such as banquet household registration and other donations, as expenses for the district office. It is a disorderly financial system. Therefore, each county was ordered to strictly ban it yesterday. In the future, each district office may not directly levy additional taxes.</p>

<p>After County Magistrate Pan Zhongjia was transferred to the Provincial Administrative Supervision Commissioner of the Eleventh District and concurrently the County Magistrate of Huaiyin County, the local public organizations, with Pan's diligent and capable administration and obedience, telegraphed the Provincial Government to retain him. However, County Magistrate Pan was sworn in in the province after being commissioned and ordered the department to rush to handle the conclusion. It has already been completed. On the 5th, he went to Suzhou to visit President Lin of the High Court and decided to go to Huaiyin to take office after the handover on the 6th. The newly appointed Administrative Supervision Commissioner of the Sixth District, Xu Weizhen, has not yet arrived in Jiading. Shen Jinghua, Director of the Public Security Bureau, was commissioned as the County Magistrate of Liyang County. The successors have not yet been announced. Whether the Bureau will be merged into the county government or not has not yet been clearly ordered. Director Shen is temporarily difficult to hand over. It is said that he will temporarily hand over to the county government after the new county magistrate takes office, and then go to Liyang to take office. Zhuang Guang, Director of the Finance Bureau, resigned due to other tasks and requested that Wang Yaoyong, the chief of accounting, be the agent. It has been approved by the command.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Telegraphed Order: Abolish Taels and Adopt Dollars Starting Today</h3>
<p>Silver Tael Transactions No Longer Legally Valid</p>
<p>Silver and Money Businesses Held Emergency Meetings Yesterday</p>
<p>Following the implementation on March 10th, requiring all transactions to use the silver dollar standard, the Ministry of Finance telegraphed Shanghai yesterday, ordering that from today onwards, all public and private funds and all transactions must uniformly use silver coins, and no longer use silver taels. Upon receiving the order, silver and money businesses immediately convened separate emergency meetings to discuss implementation measures. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Ministry of Finance Telegram) To the Exchange Supervisor, Chamber of Commerce, Banking Association, and Money Dealers' Association: The Ministry has determined that starting April 6th, all public and private funds and all transactions must uniformly use silver coins, and no longer use silver taels.

Payments should be made in silver dollars. In other places outside Shanghai, the Haikwan tael conversion should be done first based on the exchange rate on April 5th, and then the Haikwan tael should be converted to silver dollars. Any new contracts, bills, or payments of public or private funds, and all transactions that still use silver taels after this date, will be legally invalid. As for those holding silver taels, they can request the Central Mint to mint silver coins on their behalf according to the regulations of the Silver Standard Coinage Act, or send them to the local Central Bank, Bank of China, or Bank of Communications to exchange for silver coins for circulation, for convenience. In addition to publicizing and circulating this order, we are urgently telegraphing you to inform and instruct you to comply. Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>Wu Chaoshu Discusses Anti-Japanese Boycott, Believing It More Effective Than Military Action</h3>
<p>China's Scattered Economic Organization is Superior to Japan's in Wartime</p>
<p>Direct Negotiations with Japan Are Not Impossible, But Impractical</p>
<p>Unwilling to Serve as Minister of Justice, Willing to Exert Effort on Matters Directly Related to the National Crisis</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice Society visited Mr. Wu Chaoshu, a member of the Central Committee, yesterday morning and discussed various issues in detail. The discussions are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3>Using Strengths to Counter Weaknesses</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Wu, military affairs are paramount and diplomacy is secondary during this period in China. However, there is a powerful weapon whose strength and effectiveness are as important as military action, or even more so, but it has not yet been properly utilized. What is this? It is the economy. Although China's economy is disorganized, it still maintains its inherent rural social and economic conditions. Therefore, when a problem occurs in one area, the rest of the country, while inevitably affected, will not be dragged into the overall situation. Because of this, China is economically superior to Japan and can maintain its economic independence. Japan is an organized nation in its economy. However, because it is so organized, a problem in one area often controls the overall situation. Therefore, the disorganization of China's economy is a major drawback in peacetime, but it is a strength during this difficult time. In comparison to Japan, China's military equipment is far behind. However, economically, China has strengths and Japan has weaknesses. The Chinese people should know themselves and their enemy, and use their strengths to counter their weaknesses. The method of application is to implement a boycott of Japanese goods and impose economic sanctions. The import of Japanese goods into China is like tanks and airplanes at Xifengkou and Shimenzhai, and its harm is even more severe. Now that the people of the country are advocating being the military backing of the country, I believe that there is no second method other than this, which is more than a thousand miles away from empty words of saving the country. Do you not see Germany's discrimination against the Jews? Orders are issued in the morning and arrive in the evening, and the whole country is unified, which is such a level of integrity. This is because of its complete organization and transportation. However, in China, it can only be achieved by the people's initiative. What is the use of government leadership if the people are indifferent and do not act? I have a friend who has not used Japanese goods for decades. Although the reason is not clear, if the people of the country have this spirit, they will be able to control Japan to the death.</p>
<h3>Direct Negotiations</h3>
<p>As for direct negotiations, all international exchanges between countries involve direct negotiations. Why can't China and Japan negotiate directly? However, given the current situation between Japan and China, if there are direct negotiations, Japan will demand recognition of the puppet organizations and various illegal demands. So, what negotiations can there be? In short, it is not that direct negotiations are impossible, but that direct negotiations are impractical. As for the progress of the League of Nations' Twenty-Two-Nation Advisory Committee, it is not yet predictable. However, the establishment of this committee is only based on how the overall situation changes to determine its response policy.</p>
<h3>Mandate Governance</h3>
<p>Germany and the United States' demands for Japan to return the mandate of the South Pacific Islands have now subsided slightly, but there will still be a day to resolve it in the future. Judging from the current situation, it seems that only Germany and the United States are involved. However, because of the relationship between Australia and the South Pacific, the United Kingdom will also have to ask about this matter in the future. Currently, Germany is more concerned with the problem of anti-Semitism than this matter, so it has no active attitude for the time being. Once anti-Semitism is resolved, this problem will be resolved. As for the result, it is difficult to say realistically. However, if Mussolini's Four-Power Pact succeeds, then the resolution will be very easy.</p>
<h3>Not Serving as Minister of Justice</h3>
<p>It is also said that the Central Government has asked me to serve as Minister of Justice. I heard about this matter when I was in Beijing, but I did not agree and have formally declined. Some say that everyone should go to the country's rescue during this time. However, I will devote my efforts to matters directly related to the national crisis in the future. Also, I have stated that I will not take the position of Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee when I attended the Foreign Affairs Committee last time and will only serve as temporary chairman. Recently, some people have written to me, directly addressing the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. This is a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Announces Cancellation of Land Acquisition Ban</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways has decided to temporarily postpone the plan to acquire land in the Zhenru, Pengpu, and Jiangwan districts of Shanghai for the construction of a passenger and freight transport hub and temporary station on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. The order to suspend the sale and purchase of land in the acquired areas will be cancelled first. The land acquisition will be announced again when the station issue is continued.</p>
<h3>Third Batch of Antiquities Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Unloading will not be completed until this afternoon.</p>
<p>A total of 8,595 boxes have arrived, including previous shipments.</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the third batch of antiquities from the Palace Museum in Peiping (Beijing) arrived in Shanghai yesterday. There were 3,922 boxes in total. In the afternoon, they began to be moved into the former Renji Hospital site at 26 Tianzhutang Street. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Situation of Arrival: After heading south, the 3,922 boxes of antiquities of the third batch were transferred to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangtian steamer to Shanghai. The steamer left Pukou, Nanjing at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday and arrived at the port at 1:00 PM yesterday. It docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf. Cheng Xingling, a secretary of the Palace Museum, and eleven others, three representatives from the Antiquities Exhibition Hall, Chen Rui, an advisor from the Executive Yuan, and seven staff members, and a company of soldiers from the Capital Gendarmerie Headquarters with two machine guns came along to escort the items. After arriving in Shanghai, the main personnel went ashore to inspect the warehouse and arrange for the items to be moved. Because everything had been arranged in advance, the Mautai Automobile Company workers began to move the boxes. Because there were too many boxes, it is expected that the transportation will not be completed until 5:00 PM today.</p>
<p>Wharf Protection: The Shanghai Municipal Council and the Chinese authorities sent detectives to guard the Jinliyuan Wharf. On the water, there were patrol boats. On land, there were French police, the Public Security Bureau, and detectives. The soldiers sent to escort the items were responsible for guarding the ship. The road near the wharf was blocked to pedestrians, just like last time, with abnormal security. After the loading began, one French police officer, one detective from the Public Security Bureau, and one staff member from the museum escorted each truck. The Jiangtian steamer was divided into four holds, front and back, top and bottom. The doors and windows were sealed with seals from the Executive Yuan, which was quite careful.</p>
<p>Antiquity Types: The 3,922 boxes of antiquities that arrived yesterday included 814 boxes of books from the Peiping Antiquities Exhibition Hall, 74 boxes of bronze and jade ware from the Summer Palace in Peiping, and 3,034 boxes from the Palace Museum. Among these items, approximately 477 boxes were paintings, 593 boxes were bronze, porcelain, and jade ware, 1,240 boxes were documents and archives, and over 600 boxes were managed by the secretariat of the Palace Museum. Other items, such as carrying poles, were made into long packages because they could not be boxed, totaling 62 pieces.</p>
<p>Secretary Cheng's Talk: The reporter visited the warehouse on Tianzhutang Street and met Cheng Xingling, the secretary of the museum who escorted the antiquities to Shanghai. Yu Tongkui, the director of the General Affairs Department of the museum who had previously escorted the items to Shanghai, was also present. Mr. Cheng stated that the 3,922 boxes arrived today, including antiquities from the Antiquities Exhibition Hall and the Summer Palace. As for the fourth batch of antiquities that would be transported south and those that would remain in Peiping, and how many boxes of antiquities there were, there was no answer because Peiping was still preparing. In general, the museum will continue to pack the boxes according to the original plan. Once the order arrives, they will be shipped immediately. As for the staff, there are still people needed to take care of things in Peiping and Shanghai, and there will be no large-scale layoffs, as rumored. Everything can be said to be the same. The antiquities that have just arrived in Shanghai will be transported completely tomorrow (today). After checking the number of boxes again and affixing the seals, the matter will be completed. After storing the third batch of items on the sixth floor, the number of items brought to Shanghai in the previous two shipments was quite large. The first batch contained 1,064 boxes, the second batch contained 3,608 boxes, and the third batch contained 3,922 boxes, for a total of 8,595 boxes.</p>
<h3>Aviation Fundraising Third Session Results</h3>
<p>Totaling Over 235,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Nearly 800,000 Yuan in Three Sessions</p>
<p>The China Aviation Association held its third fundraising report yesterday. At 4 PM, Chief Fundraising Officer Mayor Wu hosted the fundraising team leaders on the ninth floor of the YMCA, including Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Shi Liangcai, Wang Yiting, Guo Le, Shen Guansheng, (representative) Dai Ji, Jin Liren, Li Tingan, Wu Xingya, Wen Hongen, Chen Songyuan, Tang Haian, Ye Jiaxing, Yang Xiaotang, and staff members from the Fundraising Headquarters Zhu Shaoping, Li Dachao, and others, totaling over fifty people. Chief Officer Wu chaired the meeting and reported that the total amount raised this session was 235,231.38 yuan. Wang Xiaolai, Shi Liangcai, and others then gave speeches, and the meeting adjourned. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Chairman's Report) Chairman Wu Tiecheng reported that the total amount raised this session was 235,231.38 yuan, including 100,000 yuan from the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, 30,000 yuan from "Shanghai Business," 12,735 yuan from "Ningbo Business," 8,000 yuan from "Shanghai Industry," and 84,496.38 yuan from various sub-teams. He then said that the total amount raised in the first, second, and third sessions was only 800,000 yuan, which is only two-fifths of the expected 2 million yuan. The remaining three-fifths must be raised within the next 25 days through everyone's efforts. Furthermore, of the 263 fundraising teams, 155 have reported, and 113 have never reported. It is hoped that those who have not reported will have excellent results next time and work extra hard.</p>
<p>(Sending Bronze Statues) Li Dachao then reported that he had received a letter from Mr. Jiang Xiaojian saying that if a Chinese person donates more than 10,000 yuan to help the country through aviation, Xiaojian is willing to make a half-length bronze statue and send it to the chief team leader for transfer to the donor as a reward. However, only the first three donors will be given the statue as a reward.</p>
<p>(Summary of Speeches) Wang Xiaolai said that ordinary people often say that they solve the problem of living, but what the Chinese people need to solve now is the problem of life and death. It is hoped that colleagues will do their best to raise the amount to 2 million yuan and complete the goal of saving the country through aviation. Shi Liangcai said that people in Shanghai live in heaven. However, thinking of the compatriots in the Great Wall passes who have suffered the misery of burning and killing, and the soldiers who have sacrificed their lives and endured hunger, how can they not have compassion? Therefore, it is hoped that all sectors of Shanghai will not wait and see, but actively participate. At the same time, it is hoped that colleagues who are running aviation should have a sense of reverence and belief. Zheng Xingpu of Guanshengyuan said that saving the country is like saving a fire. If a neighbor's house is on fire, no one will try to save it with all his might. China has a vast land and abundant resources. If we can all unite as one, we can definitely solve the national crisis. All the team leaders are leaders of the people of Shanghai. Handling aviation construction should be like saving a fire and like fighting a war. You must fight hard in the front line. Now you only need to persuade your compatriots to join the association, which is so easy. After the speeches, it was 5:30 PM, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>All Sectors of Aviation Fundraising Movement</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association's Aviation Fundraising Committee, since its initiation, was supposed to end after one month. Just as it was time for Qingming Festival, most of the team leaders returned to their hometowns to sweep the tombs, resulting in donations not being fully paid. It is now reported that the Standing Committee of the Association has decided to extend the period by one month to reach the total goal of 200,000 yuan. Afterwards, the results will be announced every ten days.</p>
<p>The Aviation Fundraising Team Office inside the YMCA received donations from various places, including 5.89 yuan from the beef stallholders in the Hongkou Triangle area, 5.4 yuan saved on meals from the colleagues of the Sino-Foreign Association at 70 Jingshi Road, Nanjing, 3 yuan from Pan Amao, 5 yuan from the Broadway Pifu Association, 15 yuan from Shen Shichang of Guangyin Plate Making Company, and 173.10 yuan from the entire male and female workers of the Donggou Cutting Plant of the Great China Match Company who donated their double wages on the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, including 96.93 yuan from 149 male workers, and 76.17 yuan from 229 female workers, 0.5 yuan each from Zhang Yixing, Chen Shaoji, and Sun Guoquan from Shuidong Town, Xuancheng, Anhui, 0.3 yuan from Wu Jinxiang, a seven-year-old child, 0.1 yuan each from Hu Yulin and Jia Sigao, and 1 yuan from Zhang Yushan.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Letter to Silver and Money Businesses to Stop Lending to Treacherous Merchants</h3>
<p>Should Urge Colleagues to Have Determination</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the silver and money businesses yesterday, asking them to stop lending to treacherous merchants, to facilitate the boycott of Japanese goods. The original letter said, "Dear Sirs, since the realization of the ceasefire in Shanghai, the Japanese invasion has been increasingly urgent, and the territory that has been lost is expanding. The act of treacherous merchants selling Japanese goods is becoming more and more brazen. The reason for this is that the public has no means of restraint, so-called public opinion is not enough to move them. This association believes that to impose an economic blockade on the enemy, we must first impose an economic blockade on the treacherous merchants. Otherwise, it is just empty talk and will be laughed at by the enemy. Please notify your members that all merchants who have dealings with you should be investigated for private sales of Japanese goods. Once such circumstances are found, you should immediately stop providing loans and recover the debts that have been loaned out, so that the treacherous merchants will be warned. This matter is the most important task for saving the country at present. We hope that you will urge your colleagues to have determination and implement it."</p>
<h3>Fishermen and Merchants Issue Declaration</h3>
<p>Oppose the Collection of Fishery Construction Fees</p>
<p>Fishermen and merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang oppose the collection of fishery construction fees by the Fishery Improvement Committee, which increases the burden on fishermen. They have telegraphed the central government to stop it, and have organized the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fishermen and Merchants Committee to Deny Fishery Construction Fees Appeal. They issued a declaration yesterday, "To fellow countrymen, agencies, groups, and newspapers across the country, Our country has been established as an agricultural country, and fish production has always been abundant. Especially along the coast, the breeding is particularly prosperous. Millions of fishermen rely on fishing for a living, enduring hardship and labor, and it is difficult to get enough to eat. Our fishermen and merchants go out to the open sea to gather and purchase, not avoiding the wind and waves, braving the dangers of piracy, and transferring the market to make a profit. Fishermen and merchants depend on each other for survival. However, since the strong enemy has invaded and eroded our fishing rights, selling them in various places and occupying the market, the domestic fishing industry is declining day by day, and the livelihoods of fishermen are gradually falling into hardship. The government witnessed the sadness and resolutely exempted fish taxes and fishery taxes in March of the 20th year, and said that in the future, no matter what kind of agency, it should not establish another name to collect this tax, and resolutely eliminate long-standing malpractices, in order to protect the fishing industry and relieve the people's difficulties. Fishermen and merchants are rejoicing, preparing to catch their breath, and then slowly improving. However, the Fishery Improvement Committee has a proposal to collect fishery construction fees, formulate regulations, and send personnel to collect fees on a regular basis, which is bound to be implemented. A 2% fee is charged on all fishery products, whether fresh, salted, or dried, without exception. However, the resolution is to be implemented, exhausting the pond to catch the fish, and taking from the impoverished. In addition, there are pirate harassments, so we cannot produce with peace of mind. We are oppressed by strong neighbors layer by layer, and half of our existing fishing rights have been lost. We hate foreign goods, but we lack the resources for construction. We don't have time to lead the way, and how can we have the resources to set aside funds for construction? Furthermore, the collection of construction fees is collected by the fish industry, and the burden is entirely on the fishermen and merchants, without a doubt. If the distribution is uneven, how can it be fair? At present, fishermen and merchants have huge expenses for transportation fees and licenses, and the turnover is not flexible. Closures and bankruptcies are often heard of. We don't have time to save ourselves, let alone have the resources to bear the expenses and calmly talk about construction? If the government can find other funds and implement them in the construction of the fishing industry, it will not only be something that the fishing industry cannot get. The national economy and the people's livelihood will be dependent on it. If it is said that those used for fishermen must still be taken from fishermen, then without enjoying the benefits of construction, the fishermen and merchants of the two provinces will have long been in the market of dry fish. The dying urgently need rescue, and how can the burden be added again? This is what our fishermen and merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are sworn to fight to the death against. It is a matter of great importance, and it is difficult to remain silent. Therefore, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fishermen and Merchants Committee to Deny Fishery Construction Fees Appeal was established today to engage in all aspects of denying the construction fee. Once the task is completed, it will be concluded. In addition to telegraphing the central government, we hereby announce the will of this association to the world. We hope that you will examine it."</p>

Excluding the first to fourth redemptions, this lottery is for the fifth redemption, drawing two lots, each worth $80,000, totaling $160,000, equivalent to 2/1000 of the total issuance. Therefore, the lottery method will use the last three identical digits of the serial number as the winning bond tickets. The total issuance of the Republic of China 18th Year Disbandment Public Bonds was $50 million. Excluding the first to tenth redemptions, this lottery is for the eleventh redemption, drawing one lot totaling $500,000, equivalent to 1/100 of the total issuance. Therefore, the lottery method will still use the last two identical digits of the serial number as the winning bond tickets. Furthermore, the actual issuance of the Republic of China 20th Year Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds was $6 million. Excluding the first redemption, this lottery is for the second redemption, drawing two lots totaling $120,000, equivalent to 2/100 of the total issuance. Therefore, the lottery method will also use the last two identical digits of the serial number as the winning bond tickets. For the aforementioned three types of winning bond tickets, payments for the 20th Year Short-Term Financial Public Bonds and the 20th Year Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds will begin on the 15th of this month, while payments for the 18th Year Disbandment Public Bonds will begin on the 30th of this month.

Payments will be made in national currency regardless of location. Supervisors, please examine the lottery tickets and the lottery ticket register for accuracy before proceeding with the lottery."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Focuses on Reconstruction Efforts</h3>
<p>Organizing a Committee to Discuss</p>
<p>The Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council recently held its seventh meeting. Chairman Shi Liangcai, after making a report, led discussions on various proposals, including the "Detailed Implementation Rules for Handling Labor-Management Disputes" submitted by the Municipal Government, which was assigned to the Social Affairs Group for review. The issuance of the Shanghai Reconstruction Public Bonds occurred before the council's establishment, but the subsequent progress of the project, the expenditure of funds, and the welfare of the city and its citizens are of great concern. The council had previously requested the full file on the issuance of reconstruction bonds from the Municipal Government. At this meeting, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Bingyi, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Xu Yushu, and Li Fusun were appointed as members, to be convened by Xu Yushu, to discuss the organization and all other related matters.</p>
<h3>Zhang Taiyan and Ma Xiangbo Each Present Couplets to Song Zheyuan</h3>
<p>General Song Zheyuan, Commander of the 29th Army and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Third Army Corps, fought valiantly at the Great Wall, killing over ten thousand enemies, and his name has become famous both at home and abroad. Mr. Zhang Taiyan and the 94-year-old Ma Xiangbo, concerned about defending against the enemy, both sent telegrams of慰勞. Mr. Xiao Zhenying, a member of the Beiping Military Sub-Committee, came to Shanghai representing Commander Song, accompanied by Sun Longji, Director of Song's Shanghai Office, and Qi Junqing, a Shanghai gentleman, to visit the two elders to express their gratitude and report on the situation at the front. The two elders were extremely delighted and immediately wielded their mighty brushes, each writing a couplet to present to Song. The vigor of their old age overflows, sufficient to inspire the people. Recorded here for the enjoyment of friends, Zhang's couplet reads, "When Han fell, Zifang rose; the Qin Emperor was ashamed of Lu Lian." Ma's couplet reads, "Protect the Yan and Huang race, rely on the iron-blooded general." Ma also presented Xiao with a couplet, saying, "Those who dare insult me, clearly teach me." All are masterpieces, sharing the same heroic spirit as General Song's determination to kill the enemy.</p>

I wish you peace and well-being."</p>
<h3>News on the Work of the National YMCA War Zone Service</h3>
<p>The ongoing work of the National YMCA War Zone Service is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Setting up Reception Centers at the Front) Quan Shaowen, the North China Director of the National Committee of the Chinese Christian YMCA War Zone Service, has already sent Song Ruhai, General Secretary of the Hankou YMCA, and war zone service workers Huo Bingheng, Zhang Mingyong, Qi Xinge, etc., departing from the Beiping YMCA on March 25th. They brought a large quantity of supplies for wounded soldiers to Jixian, Zunhua, and other places along the Xifengkou route to set up wounded soldier reception centers. In addition to medical care, they will organize education classes for the wounded soldiers, provide letter-writing services, and arrange entertainment. They have also specially set up a kitchen for the wounded soldiers to provide them with porridge, hot food, and other items so that the wounded soldiers do not feel pain in the hospital.</p>
<p>(Xifengkou) Song and others also went to the front-line headquarters to express their condolences to all the soldiers of the 29th Army, and reported that the National YMCA has set up a wounded soldier reception center to serve the wounded soldiers. Commander Song Zheyuan expressed his great welcome to this work and considered it very important, saying, "Our soldiers are normally supported by the state and are responsible for defending against the enemy. It is only natural. We will die on the front line for the country, and that is the end of it. If soldiers are not killed but are wounded, and are comforted by hospitals and reception centers organized by the people in the rear, our soldiers are very grateful."</p>
<p>On the 28th, Song and others, along with Commander Song Zheyuan, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Qin Dechun, Mr. Xiong Xiling, etc., went to Luowenyu on the front line to inspect and慰勞 the soldiers who defended the country. The morale of our army was greatly boosted. Mr. Xiong Xiling also brought film expert Zhang Yuting to film the situation of the Japanese army invading the battlefield and the process of the Japanese invaders being severely defeated and repelled by our army.</p>

<p>Luowenyu is one of the important passes of the Great Wall. It is located in the midst of towering mountains and steep hills. The mountain road is rugged, and the road at the exit can only accommodate one pedestrian. High mountains surround it, all encircled by the Great Wall. It is located about a hundred miles southwest of Xifengkou and only eighteen miles from Zunhua County. After the Japanese army was defeated at Xifengkou, they repeatedly tried to invade this place to cut off our army's rear. Unexpectedly, Commander Song Zheyuan knew that the Japanese soldiers would definitely come to try this pass, so he sent Division Commander Liu to station heavy troops to defend it. In the Battle of Luowenyu, the Japanese army suffered more than 700 casualties. According to the latest reconnaissance, the Japanese army has retreated 120 miles outside the pass. Commander Song said that heavy troops have now been stationed in the Xifengkou and Luowenyu area, and the defense line is very solid. If the Japanese army comes to counterattack again, our army will be able to cope with it.</p>
<p>(Lengkou) Jiang Wenhan, a school cadre of the YMCA, has also been sent north to join Ed Lefoo, Deputy Director of the North China War Zone Service of the YMCA, to set up a reception center in the Lengkou area, transiting through Tianjin.</p>
<p>(Setting up Hospitals for Wounded Soldiers in the Rear) The Tianjin YMCA has set up a hospital for wounded soldiers in Tianjin, hiring Dr. Zhou, a graduate of the Qilu University School of Medicine, to oversee everything. The hospital has an entertainment room with chess, novels, newspapers, magazines, gramophones, etc., for the light wounded soldiers to pass the time. Educational charts are hung on the walls, and movies are shown once a week. Service groups are also organized to talk to the wounded soldiers and write letters for them. Many young men and women in Tianjin have joined in. The establishment of the wounded soldier hospital took only four days to prepare, and its efficiency is admirable. Therefore, the Tianjin Local Association has promised to do its best to cooperate.</p>
<h3>Fifth District Administrative Commissioner's Office Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cao Zhenfei Takes Office Simultaneously</p>
<p>Cao Zhenfei, the Administrative Commissioner of the Fifth District of Jiangsu and concurrently Magistrate of Shanghai County, took office at 11:00 AM yesterday. The Commissioner's Office was formally established at the same time. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Notice of Taking Office</h3>
<p>Since the Provincial Government appointed Cao as Commissioner and Magistrate, the former Magistrate Yan Yu immediately ordered the departments to expedite the handover. The instruction arrived at the county government only the day before yesterday. At the same time, Cao had already sent his secretary Xu Jiqing to the county government the day before yesterday to meet with Magistrate Yan to discuss the handover procedures and notify the date of taking office.</p>
<h3>Situation Upon Arrival</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 11:00 AM, Cao, accompanied by the receiving personnel, took Magistrate Yan's car number 3304 to the county government to take office. Upon arrival, he met with Magistrate Yan and exchanged brief greetings. Yan immediately left and was escorted by a police squad. All handover matters were the responsibility of Secretary Ye Dezhen.</p>
<h3>Dispatching Personnel for Handover</h3>
<p>The handover began immediately. In addition to the seals and staff roster, which Cao personally took over, he also sent Zhu Wanqiu to take over the First Section, Yu Yaochun to take over the Second Section, and Cao Qifeng to take over accounting and general affairs. The handover was completed after 4:00 PM. Former Secretary Ye also left the county government.</p>
<h3>Announcing Staff Appointments</h3>
<p>After taking office, Cao met with Wang Huazhao, Director of the Finance Bureau, and Sun Shengzeng, Chief Technician. Except for those who have resigned, there will be no changes in the staff. Only Xu Jiqing was announced as Secretary, Zhu Wanqiu as Chief of the First Section, Yu Yaochun as Chief of the Second Section, and Cao Qifeng as Accounting Officer and General Affairs Officer.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Commissioner's Office</h3>
<p>The Administrative Commissioner's Office was also established at the same time yesterday, located on the second floor of the county government. Cao appointed Jiang Nanchun as Secretary of the Office, and Gong Shuhua and Xia Yusen as staff members. They had already taken the oath of office at the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang on March 30, so no ceremony was held yesterday.</p>
<h3>Cao's Brief Biography</h3>
<p>Cao is from Yangzhou, Jiangsu, 48 years old. He was a selected tribute student in the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty and passed the fourth examination for county magistrate. He served as county magistrate in Henan, Anhui and other provinces. When Huang Fu was the Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality, Cao served as Chief of the Second Section. During the Zhang Dingfan era, he served as Counselor of the Municipal Government and member of the Finance Committee, and later as Secretary of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department.</p>
<h3>Taking Office Announcement</h3>
<p>After taking office, Cao issued the following announcements: (1) Announcement regarding the appointment: This is to announce that I, Cao Zhenfei, have been appointed as Administrative Commissioner of the Fifth District of Jiangsu Province by the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Order No. 65. In addition, I have received from the Jiangsu Provincial Government Order No. 310 a wooden official seal, inscribed "Official Seal of the Administrative Commissioner of the Fifth District of Jiangsu Province," and a small angular official seal, inscribed "Administrative Commissioner of the Fifth District of Jiangsu Province," to be examined and used accordingly. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has been informed and requested to report.

This announcement is made for general knowledge.</p>
<h3>Large Shipment of Silver Ingots Transported to Hankou</h3>
<p>Weighing 500,000 Taels</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty-five boxes of silver ingots, weighing 500,000 taels, were loaded onto a British merchant ship yesterday and exported to Hankou this morning. It is reported that the cash was loaded by the Shanghai branch of the British-owned Mercantile Bank of India, London and China.</p>
<h3>Record of the Shanghai Waterworks Company Shareholders' Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Waterworks Company of the International Settlement held its annual shareholders' meeting at the company's office on Jiangxi Road the day before yesterday. Chairman Li Deli reported on the company's operations last year, stating that the total revenue from customers within the Settlement was 3,537,668.90 taels of silver, compared to 3,579,496.54 taels in the previous year. The decrease was mainly due to the sharp decline in the foreign silver exchange rate. Otherwise, last year's revenue would have slightly increased compared to the previous year. Secondly, the fact that residents of Hongkou moved elsewhere during the Shanghai war last year and the subsequent commercial decline also had some impact. The company's expenses, excluding those attributable to customers outside the Settlement, totaled 1,474,735.44 taels of silver, an increase of 13,149.69 taels compared to the previous year. Although the cost of water production and supply to customers decreased compared to the previous year, management and general expenses increased by 18,083.55 taels compared to the previous year, mainly due to a slight increase in staff after the installation of new water meters. Last year's net profit decreased from 1,539,461.39 taels in the previous year to 1,341,075.99 taels. This was because the half of the profit from customers outside the Settlement allocated to the profit and loss account decreased by 25,167.77 taels compared to the previous year. On the loss side, the depreciation of the factory buildings and other additions increased accordingly, and some assets were not fully depreciated. Due to their age and uneconomical operation, they suffered slight losses when sold. In addition, there were expenses and commissions for the issuance of Class C shares. Furthermore, the company unfortunately suffered a loss of 75,000 taels due to employee embezzlement last year, and more than half of it has been recovered, with continued hope of recovery. However, for the sake of prudence, the recovered portion will also be listed as a loss in the future. The revenue from customers outside the Settlement and ships declined sharply last year, decreasing from 331,794.90 taels in the previous year to 254,999.23 taels. Because most of this revenue came from Zhabei, it was greatly affected by the Shanghai war. In addition, the water used by ships also decreased compared to the previous year due to the commercial recession. Therefore, the amount of dividends for this item last year was only 64,494.75 taels, a decrease of about 40% compared to 103,080.56 taels in the previous year. Subsequently, the Chairman made some comments on last year's share increase, land purchase, and water meter system. The shareholders then approved the 1932 annual report and accounts, and the board of directors' dividend proposal, and elected a new board of directors before adjourning.</p>
<h3>Wang Delin's Family Moves In Yesterday</h3>
<p>One hundred and fifty-nine family members of General Wang Delin, Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin National Salvation Army, arrived in Shanghai from Russia the day before yesterday. Ten of them have been sent back to their hometown. Various groups have found the expenses to be enormous, so they moved to No. 8 Hengle Lane, Pushi Road, yesterday as a permanent residence. However, because the house only has fourteen rooms, which is not enough to live in, it has been decided to rent No. 1 Taiping Lane in the same lane as a residence. The women and children's workshop will still be located at No. 8 Hengle Lane.</p>
<h3>Fluctuating Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>(Umbrella Industry Resumes Work Today) Eleven umbrella factories, including Huali Time, all suspended operations in protest against the establishment of a joint business office by the industry, which affected the livelihoods of the workers. Yesterday morning, the Municipal Party Department sent Li Weixiong and the Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhu Jintao to investigate the truth at each factory. They stated that the proposed articles of association for the joint business office had not been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval, which was improper. Factories are free to choose whether or not to join. The sudden suspension of operations was also inappropriate. The factories should consider the workers' lives and resume work immediately. The factories all expressed their willingness to accept this. A joint resolution was passed by the eleven factories that they would never join the joint business office. Regarding raw materials, they should purchase national goods and fabrics together and distribute them to each factory, and the Social Affairs Bureau should be requested to send personnel to supervise at any time. It was decided that all factories would announce their resumption of work starting from the 6th (today).</p>
<p>(Fashion Industry Undergoes Another Mediation) More than twenty fashion businesses including Daxin on Fourth Avenue, etc., experienced a strike due to wage cuts by employers. They petitioned the Party and government for assistance and demanded assistance. Yesterday at 10:00 a.m., the representatives of the workers, including Gao Depei, once again urged the Party and government agencies to mediate. The Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhu Jintao to conduct mediation with representatives of the workers at the Tailors' Association. Because the person in charge of the association was not present, it was decided to conduct mediation again this morning. At the same time, the Municipal Party Department designated Zhao Zhenhui, a cadre of the Civil Movement Section, to attend and handle the matter together in order to resolve it.</p>
<p>(Weicheng Dismisses Workers) The Weicheng Silk Weaving Factory on Tianbao Road, Hongkou, which has only been open for two years, has been operating successfully. In February of this year, the factory cut workers' wages, which once caused a labor dispute. The matter was resolved after negotiations between the two parties. Recently, the factory's sales have been sluggish and work has decreased. It has dismissed two workers, Zhong Debao and Wang Yisheng. All workers, considering themselves to be in the same boat, have decided to send representatives this morning to petition the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting reinstatement. The first names listed on their petition are Zhong Debao, Wang Yisheng, Pan Ahu, Zhou Yunshan, Tu Lin, Zhao Xinhua, Xu Wuyi, Chen Ziming, Chen Zilin, Yu Haitao, Tan Qingxi, Zhu Xianfa, Wang Rensheng, Jin Aliang, and Chen Xingsheng.</p>
<p>(Yiyuan Strike Unconfirmed) The Yiyuan Rubber Factory at No. 1003 North Chengdu Road recently dismissed four workers in the shoe-shining and flannel departments, resulting in a dispute. The laid-off workers, due to difficult living conditions, petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau the day before yesterday. Yesterday's newspaper reported that more than 50 workers in the galoshes department went on strike, and the factory posted a notice limiting the striking workers to report back within five days, otherwise they would be dismissed. Yesterday, a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao made a special trip to visit Huang Yongqin, the manager of the factory, who said that the news of the strike by the workers in the factory was not true. All the workers are still working as usual, and there is no strike. Moreover, today is the Qingming Festival, which is a customary day of rest. However, because the factory is in a hurry to ship goods, it has not stopped work.</p>
<h3>The Pickled Meat and Ham Industry Opposes Inspection</h3>
<p>丨Over a hundred pieces of ham were stopped at the South Station丨</p>
<p>The pickled meat and ham industries in this city are currently opposing the Health Bureau's implementation of inspections and fees. Details were previously reported. It is now known that the two industry associations issued over two hundred letters of appeal to various industry associations the day before yesterday. This has now attracted city-wide attention and is expected to receive sympathetic assistance. Furthermore, the ham industry reports that over a hundred pieces of ham and wind-dried meat arrived from Hangzhou over the past two days but were all prohibited from leaving the station by the Health Bureau. The association has sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting serious negotiations.</p>
<h3>New Inventions in the Manufacturing Industry</h3>
<p>Chemical expert Yu Bingchen has recently invented a color-fixing agent called "Guse Ling." After prolonged testing, its results have been outstanding, surpassing imported products, while its price is far lower. When dyeing silk and cloth, adding this medicinal powder can permanently prevent fading, increase luster, and not damage the quality of the raw materials. Therefore, famous factories in this port of Shanghai, such as Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company, have been rushing to purchase it. The general factory is located in Longhua, and the office is located at No. 2 Shenxing Lane, Zilai Street, Shanghai, Chongxin Industrial Society. Telephone 81321. All sectors are welcome to try it.</p>
<h3>Autopsy of Deputy Detective Hua's Death in the Line of Duty</h3>
<p>丨The police station will provide generous compensation丨</p>
<p>Ji Lireng, Deputy Detective Hua of the Hui Division Police Station, a native of Andong, was forty-nine years old. On the 28th of last month, at 9:15 PM, he received a tip from an informant that bandits were hiding in a thatched shed on Pingliang Road in East Shanghai. Ji immediately led Western Detective Mullet and Chinese Detective No. 173, Bao Detective No. 119, and four others to the address to make the arrest. At that time, there was no starlight, and it was a dark night. Therefore, when Ji and the others arrived at the location, they were ambushed. A bandit opened fire, shooting Ji in the neck, and he fell to the ground unconscious. Subsequently, the accompanying detectives saw what happened and sent him to the police hospital for treatment. This information was previously reported. Deputy Detective Ji suffered severe injuries and the treatment was ineffective. He died from his injuries at approximately 12:00 noon the day before yesterday. The police station then transported his body to the autopsy office on Fellen Road. Yesterday morning, they reported it to the First Special District Court. Prosecutor Guo Wei, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the office to examine the body, take notes, and hear the testimony of Western Detective Mullet. Mullet stated that on the day in question, they went to the location. He immediately charged in first, but because the thatched shed was very short, he had to stoop down. He held a flashlight in his left hand and a pistol in his right hand. He saw three bandits in the room. One bandit was by the door, and the other two were still sleeping on a mat, eating red pills. He immediately ordered them not to move. Unexpectedly, the bandit at the door escaped in the darkness. At that moment, he heard a gunshot followed by several more shots in succession. Two minutes later, he called Chinese Detective No. 173 and Bao Detective No. 119 to come in and guard the two bandits. He went outside and saw Bao Detective Ji already injured and on the ground. He sent him to the hospital and then returned.</p>
<h3>The Process of Exhibits from the Fujian Huier (Orphanage) Institute Participating in the Chicago Expo</h3>
<p>Categories of Exhibits</p>
<p>National Cultural Items, Artistic Appreciation Items, Daily Necessities</p>
<p>The Century of Progress International Exposition in Chicago, USA, is scheduled to open on June 1, 1933. The Chinese government initially planned to participate. However, looking back at China in recent years, it has suffered from international capitalist and imperialist economic aggression externally, and natural disasters and man-made calamities internally, continuously and endlessly. The people are suffering to the extreme. The word "progress" is, of course, out of the question. Even when comparing the items submitted for previous competitions, such as silk and tea for foreign trade, they already appear much inferior. What about "science" and "industry"? Dong Kunfan of the Fujian Huier (Orphanage) Institute believes that this matter has a significant relationship with the honor of the country. On the one hand, it can promote national culture, and on the other hand, it can develop China's foreign trade. Therefore, he proposed that the lacquer workshop of the institute produce items to participate, divided into three categories: (1) National cultural propaganda items, (2) Artistic appreciation items, (3) Daily necessities. Fuzhou lacquerware has long been famous at home and abroad and sold to Europe and the United States. It has participated in the Panama-Pacific International Exposition and the Philippine Carnival in 1915, the Philadelphia Exposition in 1926, and the Philippine Far East Commodity Exhibition in 1929, and has won first prizes. However, its products are nothing more than Magu, Shouxian, etc., which have nothing to do with human daily life. Moreover, general lacquer merchants stick to old methods, do not make improvements, and even regard their manufacturing methods as family treasures, keeping them secret. When Huier (Orphanage) Institute was first established, it set up a lacquer workshop, recognizing that the lacquerware industry, although manual, does have the possibility of foreign trade. The technicians initially hired were all lacquer merchants, and their lacquerware manufacturing methods were no different from those of general lacquerware businesses, divided into fine and rough categories, studied in sequence, and gradually improved. Through the experience of the past decade, products such as Magu and Shouxian have been changed to lacquerware Western and non-Western statues, as well as modernized art appreciation items, which are both beautiful and practical, and deeply welcomed by society. In terms of daily necessities, fixed forms are transformed, with lightness, sturdiness, and applicability as the standards. In terms of patterns, in order to adapt to the psychology of Westerners, ancient patterns are used; in order to adapt to the Europeanized requirements of Easterners, the novelties of Western patterns are adopted. Other examples include considering the advantages of Eastern and Western art to create new-style daily necessities, such as new-style lamps with ancient patterns. As for lacquer, research is conducted on mixing Western lacquer materials with Chinese lacquer materials to explore further lacquer industry development. This also has considerable value in improving lacquerware. The process of this lacquerware production and the description of the lacquer creations are described below separately.</p>
<p>Planning Process: The exhibits are divided into three categories, requiring more than 20,000 yuan in funds to achieve success. Currently, the institute's total debt has reached more than 30,000 yuan, almost to the point of exhaustion. Maintaining the status quo is still impossible. I am sincerely afraid that my heart is willing, but my strength is not enough. However, things depend on human effort. Success or failure will be discussed later. Dong proposed the proposal to the council, Chen Kengchen, Chen Yunshan, the chairman of the board, Guo Shunqing, Huang Luyi, and other directors all believe that this move makes a great contribution to national culture. So, they issued a plan for participating in the Chicago Expo exhibits and also discussed it with Xu Chengmou, the Director of the Construction Department, who also strongly agreed. However, since the provincial government was about to be reorganized, the finances were extremely difficult. However, since the matter concerns the future of the Min province's industry, it must not be stopped due to difficulties. During this period, the funds were being planned on one hand, and the production of the factory was being supervised on the other hand. At the same time, they were also invited by the Central Organizing Committee for Participation in the Chicago Expo to serve as the Min province's commissioner for soliciting products. After being entrusted, they deeply regretted their weak ability to fulfill their duties. The collection prospects were particularly difficult due to the limited time and economic constraints. As for the progress of the institute's lacquer workshop products, fortunately, the directors felt sincerely and the comrades worked together with one heart and one mind, day and night. They also participated in the provincial product exhibition held at the Huier (Orphanage) Institute Trading Department on South Main Street on February 4. The exhibition collected products from Min province, including lacquerware, wood carvings, bamboo carvings, wood crafts, bronzes, horn combs, tea, umbrellas, famous Chinese and Western treasures, natural products, medicines, and tobacco leaves, worth more than 20,000 yuan. The funds were quickly allocated by the directors of the two departments, Sun and Fan, which contributed to its success. After careful consideration, it was indeed fortunate.</p>
<p>Product Description: The products are divided into three categories. A. National Cultural Products include lacquer statues of ten famous figures in Chinese history: the Yellow Emperor, Leizu, Lao Tzu, Confucius, Mozi, Yue Fei, Wang Shouren, Qi Jiguang, Lin Zexu, and Sun Yat-sen. They have made great contributions to culture and the nation and are worthy models for future generations, so they have the value of being made into statues. B. Artistic Appreciation Products include Guanyin, Shouxian, Maitreya, Hungry Ghost Buddha, Tieguai Li, etc., which can be made by general lacquer merchants, as well as more than 100 items such as painted statues, models, famous Taiwan Yinhua blue screen, Bogu screen, carved lacquer hanging couplets, etc. C. Daily Necessities include bowls, chopsticks, cups, dishes, plates, saucers, chairs, tables, boxes, cases, bottles, pots, stationery, etc., totaling more than 1,000 items. In addition, there are newly created Western-style chairs, tables, tea sets, and a lacquer painting of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's office, imitating Western sketching, using lacquer to sketch, which is more durable than Western oil paint. This is also a new creation in the lacquer industry. Other items, such as antique lamps, have been improved. The reason is that the training of the institute's students aims to learn by doing, and at the same time, the subject matter and methods, the purpose and technology, are completely integrated.</p>
<p>The manufacturing process is also described in three aspects. A. National Cultural Propaganda Products: Taking the lacquer statue of a famous person as an example, the first step is to collect the true image of the celebrity, first sculpt the clay model, then paste it with silk cloth, apply green lacquer, and after it is dry, knead and smoke it, then fill it flat, and after multiple polishing, add more gloss. After a dozen or so projects, the embryo bottom is formed. In the middle of the work, the soil is removed, and the weight does not exceed the catty. Finally, apply the modulated lacquer color and use the number of operations to form a beautiful image, so it is called "taking off the tire," which is the ten famous statues in today's exhibition. B. Artistic Appreciation Products: Its manufacturing method is divided into two types, one is wooden lacquer art, and the other is silk lacquer art (the manufacturing method is the same as described above), and wooden lacquer art, its method is first carved with wood, and then polished, coated with green lacquer, the work is simple and the quality is heavy, it is difficult to force likeness, and it is easy to break, so its value is lower than that of silk. C. Daily Necessities: Among lacquer products, the most related to human life are first and foremost the supplies. Great efforts have been made to improve this item. All daily necessities and supplies have been studied considerably, and can be roughly divided into five categories: (A) silk lacquerware, (B) wooden lacquerware, (C) bamboo lacquerware, (D) rattan lacquerware, (E) iron lacquerware, etc. As for lacquer, the lacquer workshop's products are very different from ordinary stores, which can also be described separately. Ordinary market goods are mostly coated with pig blood and tile ash, and fake-colored lacquer is applied on the outside. The appearance is no different, but the durability is very different. All of Huier (Orphanage) Institute's products are made of genuine materials. For example, water bowls, eating utensils, washbasins, vases, etc., are not damaged even when placed above the boiling point. This proves that the lacquer workshop's products are excellent and cannot be compared with ordinary stores. The authenticity of lacquer color is greatly related to the price. Genuine products are made of gold and silver raw materials or precious minerals, processed and modulated. After a hundred years, with the passage of time and the transformation of space, they are naturally compounded and metamorphosed. Their beauty cannot be made by artificial means. This is why genuine materials are so expensive. Fake materials lose all their pigments after a few years and are no longer beautiful. Therefore, the price of the same type of thing can differ by ten times. Those who have not studied this path for a long time cannot distinguish it. Regarding the research on lacquer and the method of mixing with Western lacquer materials, due to limited space, it will be discussed in another article. The above is only a rough outline, and this product has many shortcomings due to the limited capital and time. However, the future is long, and efforts can be expected. I especially hope that those who are enthusiastic about China's handicrafts will promote it. This is fortunate.</p>
<p>After arriving at the location, they searched it and took the two bandits to the police station for detention. The detectives also fired eight shots at that time. It is now known that the escaped bandit was also injured. Chinese Detective No. 173 and No. 119 also testified about the situation at the time. The deceased's brother, Ji Liren, also filed a case requesting to claim the body, saying that since his brother died for the public, there was nothing he could do, but there was still an old mother at home, who was in extreme grief after hearing the news. After hearing the statement, Mr. Guo instructed that the autopsy revealed that the deceased, Ji Lireng, had indeed died from a gunshot wound, and the bullet should be examined by the police station's firearms section. The body was handed over to his brother, Ji Liren, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial. It is also known that the police station believes that Detective Ji has served for more than ten years and worked diligently. Now that he has sacrificed his life for the public, they will grant generous compensation.</p>

<p>Letters</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding the news item "Daughter Enamored with Freedom" published in your newspaper on March 30, which is greatly inconsistent with the facts. Dai Mingguan is a relative of mine. He is a rascal who indulges in drunkenness all day long and does not engage in proper work. Last winter, because he was poor and desperate, and instigated by his stepmother, he actually wanted to sell his own daughter, Caixin, for a price. When this failed, he abused her. His daughter could not bear the suffering, so she complained to the China Children's Relief Association on the ninth day of the first lunar month. Because she was already of age, she could not be cared for in the association according to the regulations, so the association sent her to my house for temporary care.</p>
<p>We pitied her and agreed. At that time, my wife and I went to Shanghai several times to visit friends. Because we were responsible for the girl's guardianship, we always accompanied her back and forth. Although Dai Mingguan went through several mediations by the association, he did not repent. Instead, on the 25th of last month, he fabricated facts and falsely accused us of abducting his daughter for immoral purposes, accusing us in the Second District and First Office. The Public Security Bureau transferred the case to the Local Court, and after the interrogation was completed on the 28th, it was found that Dai Mingguan's abuse of his own daughter and false accusations were true, and he was detained pending legal action. His daughter was sent to the Women and Children's Relief Association for care, and we were declared innocent in court. This matter concerns my reputation. I am writing to inform you of the true facts and ask you to correct them quickly so that the truth may be known. I would be very grateful. Yours sincerely, Jiang Zhuoying, April 5, 1933.</p>
<p>To the Editor of Shenbao,</p>
<p>According to the Five Harmony Foreign Firm, we have recently read the "Three Source Neighborhood Rent Dispute" in the local news column of the Shenbao on April 5. It briefly stated that the tenants of the Three Source Neighborhood on Yangshupu Road had a dispute with our firm over the issue of rent reduction and exemption. Our firm notified the tenants last year, citing increased water costs, and wanted to increase the rent. The two sides were in a stalemate for a long time. Suddenly yesterday (the 4th), armed Western police came to seal the door, as many as sixty-nine households. This is very inconsistent with the facts. After investigating this time, our firm applied for a provisional attachment of the movable property of 69 households in the neighborhood, because they owed rent, not to increase the rent. Last year, our firm informed the tenants because of the sharp increase in water costs and discussed the measures, but did not state the rent increase. The original text of the notice is still there for verification. The issue of rent reduction and exemption has never occurred, and there is no reason to use it as an issue. There is no need to say more about this point regarding the law. The news is inevitably false and easily confuses the audience. For this reason, we entrusted you to write a letter to declare a correction to show the details. Sincerely, Lawyer Dai Menghan, April 5.</p>

<h3>How to Resolve the Pain of Unemployment?</h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Ye Zicha of This City丨</p>
<p>I am convinced that your column is like a compass in a ship, able to guide us out of confusion towards our future. However, after reading over a hundred letters in the past six months, the pain I personally feel—or perhaps it's not entirely personal—has not been alleviated in any way. Although through analogy and comparison, I have gained much enlightenment from shared experiences. Sir, are you not afraid of being bothered? Here, I would like to ask for guidance in escaping the bewilderment of this wrong path. I have wasted my youth in "hope" and "expectation"! A wandering life has occupied half of my twenties, and it has been almost three years since I last returned to my hometown. These three years—after leaving student life, I have been merely drifting! It's not just that my great ambitions are difficult to fulfill, but I am simply in a state of constant displacement. Time flies, and life is finite! My heart is heavy, and I cannot help but feel lost! Especially as someone with a heart that is not made of wood or stone, when I think of my parents, siblings, and wife whom I have been separated from for so long, I am saddened by the separation and look forward to the future with longing, and I cannot help but feel my heart breaking! Under the circumstances of unemployment, the state of life is self-evident! Not only do I not have money to buy books, but I have also not paid the newspaper subscription for several months, and it has even become commonplace to fill my hunger with large pancakes when I run out of rice. But even I myself do not believe it, perhaps it is because "I was born with a humble bone, destined to suffer," but poverty and hardship are something I do not take to heart. I believe that poverty and hardship are indeed the coloring of life's art; fighting against an unfavorable environment is life. Poverty and hardship will never make me feel depressed; I can also reject all the temptations of the outside world, and I trust that the great furnace of the environment will forge me into a useful vessel. Therefore, I follow my interests—my interest is in literature, please do not laugh at me for being too presumptuous—and I diligently seek advancement, and my aspirations become even more firm amidst poverty and hardship. I am also not pessimistic; "He is not one to be brought down by poverty," others praise me in this way, and I am indeed comforted. In the past: I have tried being a primary and secondary school teacher (physical education), a staff member, and a clerk, and my service and morality have earned me a reputation of being "good." However, by nature, I am clumsy in speech and lack social skills. Being born as the son of a rural farmer, and living in this society where everything requires "transcendence" in response, I therefore recognize myself as mediocre and would rather be unemployed—please do not laugh at me for being willingly degenerate. Now, what I ask for guidance on is: (1) I understand that the current misfortune is the result of past mistakes and I do not regret it at all. I have also seen through about 30% of human nature. I think: I am most suitable to go back to my hometown and be a gentleman—this is also my parents' only hope; to study, obtain a diploma, and become a gentleman is the only purpose of people who study in my hometown. But; my wish is not like this, and it has already reached this point, and I am too disappointed in people and myself. At the same time; ten years of wandering and I am still the same as before, and vanity (?) makes me always feel ashamed! Return? Stay? (2) I believe that a person is "born" not for the sake of "death"; "life" should leave some traces. Will "not living up to life," if my talent, ability, and pursuit of my interests, would it be "equal to suicide"? (3) I feel that "my time" is getting shorter every day! I really cherish every minute and second and regret wasting them—this naturally goes to "what I like" and fantasies, but; sometimes I feel it is meaningless: "Why bother! Life is finite, just get by"—this conflicting feeling, and "If I work hard, is it possible that I will not fail my expectations"? I can never make a decision. (4) Of course! "Willing to be unemployed" is a fact that scholars cannot accept! On the one hand, I ask for a job, and on the other hand, I use my free time to work hard on "what I like," but; I can live a hard life, but I cannot live a life without food or clothing. Is there also a possible way to get some financial assistance, which is a way for me to maintain my current life?</p>
<p>Answer: In your letter, you praised this column as "a compass in a ship," we can only feel ashamed; and you also said that you have "read over a hundred letters" in this column in "half a year," and your "personal pain—perhaps it is not only mine—has not been alleviated in any way," we can only feel ashamed, but we cannot entirely blame them, because the responsibility of this column is only to provide readers with our humble opinions based on theory and experience regarding the questions raised by the public, for reference or discussion. Regarding the unemployment problems of many readers, all we can do is just that, we are not philanthropists, not accounting offices, not factories, not employment agencies, and even less like the thousand-handed and thousand-eyed Guanyin, who can save all living beings with a drop of willow branch; nor can we be like the God in the Bible who can feed thousands of people with one bun. The latter is of course a fantasy, and the former is not a fundamental solution, but merely treating the symptom rather than the cause. Not only can we not, but we also do not want to, this should be told to you first.</p>
<p>Your letter is full of empty talk, and your thoughts are unusually chaotic. This is probably due to your difficult situation. The most important thing you said is: How can I get financial help in this time of unemployment and maintain my current life? We have no other "method," we have no choice but to ask you to write a resume, skills, and send it directly to this newspaper's "Self-Employment Introduction" column to advertise to employers. In the opinion of this reporter, since you "were born as the son of a rural farmer," it is best to return to the countryside to be a farmer, but definitely do not be a "gentleman," not only do not be a gentleman, but also stand in opposition to him, helping poor farmers to do practical life struggles, unite the masses, and strive to solve the fundamental problems of the countryside—the first is the land problem. Didn't you say: "Life should leave some traces"? Then you can only go back to your hometown and use your knowledge to influence the rural masses, this is your only way to "leave traces." You stay in the city—in this city of mountains and seas of people, I am afraid that you will end up "drifting." And I think your writing is not very good, and your thoughts are not clear, it is best to go to our Shen Bao Circulation Library to read books before you "starve to death," perhaps your aspirations will gradually change, and it is not known—this should be told to you second.</p>

<h3>Education News</h3>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>Reflections After Visiting the Jiaotong University Industrial and Railway Exhibition (Chao Guan)</h3>
<p>The Jiaotong University Industrial and Railway Exhibition has been open for six days, and the number of visitors is in the tens of thousands every day. The reporter also drove there yesterday and toured for a week, and was deeply touched. I will briefly describe a few points for those who have not yet visited.</p>
<p>The content of the exhibition is mainly industrial, and the participating factories are mostly Western merchants. The layout is grand and impressive. Domestic manufacturers, except for a few such as Xinzhong, Yizhong, Huasheng, and Yuanfeng, occupy a limited position, and the exhibits are also very few, making it difficult to attract the attention of the audience. Thinking that there are countless domestic factories in Shanghai, but most of them cannot spend huge sums of money for advertising and promotion to compete with foreigners, which leads to foreign goods flooding the market, making people think that the guest is usurping the role of the host, which is regrettable. This is one.</p>
<p>Since the opening, the visitors have been very crowded. The reporter was among them, entering and exiting in single file, taking a quick look, and regretting that they could not stop to browse the various charts. According to a gentleman from the school, President Li intends to enlighten the public and hopes that the exhibition will arouse the public's desire to learn. Therefore, he does not want to restrict the audience. Although his words are reasonable, the reporter ultimately regrets that there are too many visitors and he could not enjoy the exhibition. This is two.</p>
<p>The exhibition hall displays the latest inventions of modern times, such as telegraphs, elevators, radios, automatic telephones, locomotives, airplanes, searchlights, printing presses, and nail-making and sock-knitting machines, all of which are available. Most of them can be demonstrated by the administrator at any time, and everything that the general public usually regards as magical and unpredictable is explained in detail. The greatness of this educational power can hardly be compared to any other method. Those of us who have not been able to travel abroad, once inside, it is like being in a prosperous city in Europe and America, and we cannot help but be glad that our eyes have been opened. This is three.</p>
<p>The exhibition is most abundant in engineering and railway aspects, such as materials and models for railways, highways, and river works, steel, hardware, and paint required for machine manufacturing, and motors and radios used in electrical engineering. There is more than one exhibitor and more than one display. Not only can students observe and study, but experts who want to gain new knowledge or new insights can also enjoy the pleasure of following the clues and finding what they are looking for. In my opinion, the exhibition should set a time to invite experts to visit, so that they can discuss and study together, and the benefits will be even greater. This is four.</p>
<p>The equipment in our country's primary and secondary schools is mostly incomplete. There are always those who study science textbooks for ten years without ever seeing a simple instrument. During the exhibition, the school's laboratories are all open, and the instruments on display are clearly labeled for reference. The exhibits of the manufacturers can show the effectiveness of science and correspond to the textbooks, which are too numerous to mention. It is enough to arouse the interest of young students in science and promote their habit of learning and thinking deeply. This is five.</p>
<p>Domestic industry is still in its infancy, and borrowing from others is a top priority. There are many novel and exquisite exhibits from foreign countries. If manufacturers can carefully investigate, it will greatly help to improve their products. Those who aspire to industry can also discover countless new products for research and trial manufacturing. I think that the scope should be expanded in the next exhibition to include metallurgy and chemical industries, so that the types of exhibits will be more diverse and the opportunities for comparison and observation will be more numerous. This is six.</p>
<p>I believe that exhibitions are essential for the development of culture. Foreign cities often hold more than a dozen types of exhibitions every year. Our country is urgently seeking construction, and the relationship is even more important. It seems that the government and various provinces and cities should hold exhibitions in rotation from time to time, so that people from all over the country have the opportunity to visit, so as to arouse their interest in industry. The industrial and commercial circles should actively participate, so that technology can be improved through observation and sales can be increased through publicity. The benefits to the progress of social material civilization will be significant.</p>

<h3>Shandong Education Sector Actively Donates Funds to Comfort Troops and Presents One Thousand Broadswords</h3>
<p>丨And Purchases Comfort Items with 10,000 Yuan丨</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: All sectors of the province are actively and enthusiastically comforting the soldiers fighting on the front lines. The Charity Association of all sectors is making two thousand broadswords, which will be transported north soon. The Provincial Party Headquarters has convened all sectors to initiate a Comfort Anti-Japanese Soldiers Association, which is also raising funds. After the education sector initiated the donation of funds to comfort the troops, all parties actively contributed. In the past ten days, more than 12,000 yuan has been raised. Regarding the use of the donated funds, it has been decided to make one thousand broadswords within ten days and send them to the soldiers on the front lines for the need to kill the enemy, and to purchase clothing, shoes, and other items with 10,000 yuan. Therefore, the iron factories in this city are extremely busy, working day and night to rush to make weapons to kill the enemy, which will be transported to the front lines soon. At 9:00 a.m. today, the Standing Committee of the Education Sector Anti-Japanese Soldiers Comfort Association held a joint meeting of the Purchasing Committee in the Education Hall. All members attended, with Wang Ziyu as the chairman. The meeting was held as usual. The chairman reported that the association has recently received more than 12,000 yuan in donations and should immediately purchase items to send to the soldiers on the front lines and the wounded soldiers in the rear. Because they did not know what kind of items were most needed on the front lines, they had sent letters to Minister He (Yingqin), General Zhu (Qinglan), and the Tianjin-Beijing Local Association to inquire. They have received replies one after another and asked everyone to discuss so that they can proceed quickly. At that time, the members had many opinions and resolved the following two points: (1) Use 10,000 yuan to comfort the injured soldiers in the rear with 5,000 yuan in cash, and use 5,000 yuan to purchase items to send to the front lines. The types of items to be used on the front lines should be purchased by the Purchasing Committee in consultation with the letters from all parties. The deadline is the 5th (7th) of this month to purchase all items. (2) Make one thousand broadswords in Jinan within ten days and give them to the soldiers on the front lines, and so on. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<p>After the joint meeting was adjourned, the Purchasing Committee continued to meet. All members attended, with Qi Huai as the chairman. They discussed the types of items to be purchased and publicly elected those responsible for purchasing them. It was resolved that: 1. Buy one thousand sets of jackets and trousers, two thousand pairs of cloth shoes, and four thousand silkworm bags, and use the remaining funds to buy towels. 2. Publicly elect Wang Rubiqu, Qu Han, and San to buy towels and silkworm bags, and Dong Weichuan, Xu Bopu, and Yu Xiaochuan to buy jackets and trousers and cloth shoes. Qian Luting and Meng Ruikui order broadswords. 3. All items purchased must be domestic goods. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Shandong Province Will Increase Education Funding</h3>
<p>The 21st-Year Education Funding is More Than 2.7 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The 22nd Year Will Increase 90,000 Yuan for Overtime Pay</p>
<p>丨Shandong University Increases 60,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong Province's education funding has been actively adjusted since the establishment of the provincial government in the 17th year and after He Siyuan, the current director of the Education Department, took office, and it has made considerable progress. The education funding has also increased year by year. As of the 21st year, it has increased to more than 2.7 million yuan (before the 17th year, it was only more than 1.1 million yuan per year). The current Education Department is preparing the budget for the 22nd year. Although it has not increased the number of schools, there are some that must increase the number of classes, and it is estimated that it must increase by 120,000 yuan compared with the 21st year. Later, after repeated efforts to save money, another 30,000 yuan was saved, but it still had to increase by 90,000 yuan, for a total of more than 2.79 million yuan. However, it is not yet possible to predict whether the provincial government will pass it. Shandong University, since its establishment, the central government has not issued a penny of funds, and it is entirely reliant on the Shandong Provincial Government's annual assistance of 360,000 yuan to maintain it. Qingdao's central government subsidizes 36,000 yuan per year, and the Jiaoji Railway subsidizes 12,000 yuan per year. In the coming year, the school's old students will have students who have been promoted to the fourth grade. If they do not recruit new students, the old students will not be able to connect after graduation. It is estimated that recruiting new students will require an increase of 60,000 yuan in the budget. It is not yet known whether it will be approved. The school originally planned to set up an agricultural college in Jinan after the summer vacation this year, but it is feared that it will be abandoned due to lack of funds. The first-year students of the engineering college will be promoted to the second grade after the summer vacation. It was originally planned to move to the old Jinan Industrial Vocational School to work, but the school site was occupied by the medical college, and it has been abandoned.</p>

<h3>Philippines Preparing to Win Far Eastern Track and Field Championship</h3>
<p>Excellent Results in the All-Philippine Games Track and Field</p>
<p>The Philippines' track and field results have always been very impressive in the Far East, but unfortunately, they were completely overwhelmed by the Japanese in the last Tokyo Games. Now that the 10th Far Eastern Games are approaching, the Filipinos, knowing that the track and field events in the next Games will be divided into track and field championships, and that the Filipinos are rich in talent in track events, athletes across the country are striving together, aiming to compete with the Japanese in the track events of the next Games. Recently, the track event results in the All-Philippine Games held in Manila were particularly good. Among them, the most prominent was Adal's 1,500-meter result of four minutes and five seconds, breaking the previous Far Eastern record of four minutes and six seconds. The 400-meter first place, Yan Estrada, had a result of exactly fifty seconds. The 200-meter first place was also Yan, with a result of twenty-two seconds, both setting new records for the Philippines. As for the decathlon athlete Mein, his total score was also on par with the Far Eastern record. Other athletes, such as Garcia in the high and low hurdles (last Far Eastern low hurdles champion and high hurdles runner-up), tied the Far Eastern record. The next Far Eastern Games should be able to win. Gong Shige and Nipamol Nesino, the sprinters, are still healthy. Gong's 100-meter result is 10.5 seconds, which is comparable to the Japanese Yoshioka. Therefore, the Philippines has a better chance of winning the track and field championship in the next Far Eastern Games.</p>
<p>For the competition, all players must gather at the SEC dressing room of the Western Football Team at 2:00 PM to go to Yiyuan together. The lineups are as follows:</p>

<h3>The Broadsword Stands Out</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Ever since General Song Zheyuan's army defeated the enemy at Xifengkou, the broadsword team has been standing out. Recently, the Guangzhou student anti-Japanese federation proposed to purchase 2,000 broadswords to send to the brave anti-Japanese soldiers at the front, in order to cut off all enemy heads. As the saying goes: "A precious sword is given to a hero," this is exactly the intention.</p>
<p>Japan claims to be a country that manufactures famous swords. Examining their books on swords, such as "Military Equipment Examination," "Sword Records," "Ancient Sword Inscriptions," and "Sword Secret Treasures," they all describe Japanese swords as being like Gan Jiang and Mo Xie. However, they unexpectedly lost at Xifengkou. One captain insisted on using his family's Japanese sword in battle, but still lost and died. Why are Japanese swords so useless?</p>
<p>When Matsuoka Yosuke attended the Geneva conference, it was rumored that his mother had given him a precious sword, instructing him to strive for success. If diplomacy failed, he should commit suicide with the sword. Now, Japan's diplomatic failure has become an undeniable fact. Upon returning to the country, Matsuoka will probably have to return the sword to his mother and say: "Precious sword returned, forgive me for not committing suicide."</p>
<p>Regarding the facts about swords, how enthusiastic is the gift of swords from Guangzhou students? How dejected is Matsuoka Yosuke's surrender of the sword? From now on, the reputation of Japanese swords will plummet!</p>
<p>What is the point of talking about "Kote-giri"? It's not as good as the three-foot iron of the Song army; what is the point of boasting about "Danzoku"? It's not as good as the broadsword and axe of the Song army.</p>
<p>Note丨Eastern records exaggerate the sharpness of Japanese swords, claiming that someone cut an enemy with a sword and cut through his arm armor, hence the name "Kote-giri," where "kote" is another name for arm armor. Another person wielded a Japanese sword to kill a group of bandits, and with a single stroke, he cut off the thighs of three robbers, hence the name "Danzoku."</p>
<h3>Airplane and Broadsword</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Speaking of Japanese airplanes, I can't help but shudder. I saw it with my own eyes during the January 28th Incident. The big dragonfly circled a few times above the rooftops, squatted down on its rear, and went off with its head held high. No sooner said than done, in the instant it squatted on its rear and raised its head, a bomb landed with a thunderous crash, and thick smoke billowed from the house. At the same time, a few sparse and crisp rifle shots rang out below, indicating the pus of the Japanese, while our national heroes, with necks outstretched, calmly responded to the attack. But there was no way to heaven or door to earth, and the fellow refugee comrades cowering in the house, those who died without the qualification of a car to transport them to the coroner's office, I don't know exactly how many thousands, hundreds, or tens there were. A foreign big shot watching the fire from across the river said, "That airplane thing, its only wonderful use, lies in bombing innocent civilians." Whether this foreign big shot is a cohort of the old Shaw Bernard, who especially loves to speak in a strange and eccentric way, I don't know, but the wonderful use of airplanes is just like that, no matter what, ××× percent, that's for sure.</p>
<p>With such a wonderful use of airplanes, the foreign big shot also felt a bit of a shudder, so he spoke dreamily of restricting countries of the first rank like that Mowen, not allowing them to have more than 501. Ashamed of something similar, our unorganized country is also allowed to prepare 100 for decoration. China's territory is so large, but the foreign big shots only deign to give us 100, watching as China has no hope of going to Tokyo to squat on its rear, raise its head, and vent a grievance. But I don't think so, we have plenty of broadswords. I can chop with the broadsword so fast that people won't even have time to shout "Daddy." Airplanes only bomb innocent civilians, while our broadsword teams specialize in chopping armed enemies. Airplanes drop bombs, and when they're dropped, they're gone, but when our broadswords break, they can still be displayed. Having too many airplanes is subject to restrictions, but having as many broadswords as possible doesn't matter. Someday we will use broadswords to recover lost territory, flatten the Three Islands, and only then will we show our faces. You just watch.</p>
<h3>Introducing a Few Foreign Words</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>丨For Our Fellow Countrymen To Hear丨</p>
<p>Foreigners have always looked down on us Chinese, and the humiliation we experience in diplomatic circles is well known to everyone and need not be elaborated on. But I want to introduce to my fellow countrymen conversations about friendship between foreigners and Chinese, which on the surface seem light and understated, but in their bones contain satire.</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Yuan Zuanzhi, he studied at Cornell University in the United States, and interned in a certain factory. At that time, there was an American in the factory who got along very well with him. During his free time from work, he would always go to a nearby coffee shop with him for a while, have a drink; or go to a clearing for a walk, and sometimes they would also have academic discussions. That American was extremely proud, and said: "A Chinese like you is really qualified!" My friend felt that this sentence was very grating, as if Chinese people were all uncivilized and unexceptional elements, how contemptuous! He immediately replied to him: "That's not necessarily true! Because people like me are extremely common among Chinese people."</p>
<p>This matter happened many years ago. At that time, Dr. Monroe from the United States came to China to inquire about etiquette. He had always admired the cultural relics of our Suzhou, so he came to appreciate the scenic spots of Tiger Hill, Lingyan Temple, Xuanmiao Temple, and the Lion Grove. The people in Suzhou's academic circles accompanied him on tours everywhere. When he saw our old-fashioned oyster shell windows and thread-bound ancient books, and the absence of grand buildings, he praised them endlessly, saying: "Your country already has such good things, so why give them up to follow others?" Finally, he rested and drank tea in a certain tea house, and saw that the guests were all talking and laughing in a calm and unhurried manner. He was very surprised and said: "Your countrymen have such great leisure and fortune, which is unattainable in my country." Alas! The unemployed wanderers fill the country, how can the country develop and flourish!</p>
<p>Yesterday Huang Shaoqiu and I talked, and he had a British friend who came to Shanghai, China for the first time. On a thoroughfare, he heard the singing of radios installed in front of various shops, one after another, which was very lively. He said to Mr. Huang: "Your countrymen are all optimists, and really know how to seek pleasure!" "A merchant girl doesn't know the hatred of a fallen country, and across the river she still sings 'Backyard Flowers'." This can probably be said to be entertaining without forgetting to save the country, and saving the country without forgetting to entertain.</p>

<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Ultimately Failing to Untie the Knot, He Visits the Door and Makes a Mistake; Secretly Pitying the Maid's Wish, He Shares Food and Rewards</p>
<p>Jiang walked to the outer hall and poked her head into the inner room, laughing: "Old Master, you two are really good! You don't look like father and son, but like..." As she spoke, she suddenly paused. The Old Master saw that she was holding two large radishes in her hands, so he got up to greet her and said: "Old Lady, what's the matter? Are you sending us radishes to eat?" Jiang said: "I just heard the company commander say that he wanted to buy radishes, but he was afraid of buying frozen ones. My family has a dozen catties of good radishes, so I'll send the Old Master two." Zhao Ziqiang, upon hearing this, thanked her repeatedly and took the radishes. Old Man Zhao said: "My son and I were just praising your eldest daughter!" Jiang said with a smile: "Isn't that right? To tell you the truth, we have no relatives to rely on. If it weren't for this child being so satisfactory, what would be the point of me living? Although she has no ability, her heart is very good. She saw that Company Commander Zhao bought chicken and meat to show filial piety to the Old Master, and she was just anxious, saying that she also wanted to buy meat to simmer some soup for me to drink. I said that there was no need for that, as long as she had this intention, that would be enough." Old Man Zhao said with a smile: "Don't just stand there and talk, sit down for a while." Jiang said: "I won't sit down. My daughter and I are still rushing to make a cotton robe for someone." After saying that, she left with a smile. Zhao Ziqiang said to Old Man Zhao: "This eldest daughter is very good. She even knows to buy meat to simmer soup for her mother to eat. Let's thank her for sending us two radishes. When the soup is simmered, let's send a bowl to her family. What do you think?" Old Man Zhao nodded and said: "Good. Just based on her saying that she will never marry and will support her mother, we should help people a little. But supporting her mother is one thing, and getting married is another. These are two separate things." Zhao Ziqiang said: "Although they are two separate things, they are ultimately one thing. Once a girl gets married, she has to listen to her mother-in-law in everything. How can she find the time to support her mother?" Old Man Zhao said: "Why can't she? Choose an understanding family..." Zhao Ziqiang smiled and shook his head again, saying: "I thought you were modern-minded just now, but now I have to say that you are old-fashioned. The first condition for marriage these days is that there must be love between the two."</p>

<h3>Opening the Mouth Movement</h3>
<p>— Xu Wancheng</p>
<p>The Chinese people's mouths were originally half-sealed and half-open, which can be said to be a half-open door!</p>
<p>Why don't people want to speak, why don't they dare to speak? Fearing that it would be detrimental to oneself, or be criticized by others, or be prohibited by 乂乂. "Tonight, we can only talk about the wind and the moon, so as to avoid trouble," everyone thinks like this!</p>
<p>In fact, not only are the mouths of the Chinese people half-sealed and half-open, but so are the mouths of all human beings in the world! There are facts to prove it!</p>
<p>Japan unreasonably invaded and destroyed the anti-war pact of all mankind, but who opened their mouths to denounce it? Just stuttering and speaking a few words as if out of breath.</p>
<p>Humanity needs an "opening the mouth movement"! Say what you have to say, don't hide anything, be consistent in word and deed, and then humanity will have a day of peace and tranquility.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Student Army (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ren Yu</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>The sun had just emerged from the east side of the parade ground, gathering a few rays of light. The tall auditorium, classrooms, and dormitories, several rows of buildings, were all immersed in the dense fog that had not yet dissipated, everything was quiet and dull, like an open and pale face.</p>
<p>Old Chen took a cloth and energetically wiped his new partner, the brass bugle, making it one hundred and twenty percent shiny, enough to be called pretty in the team. After a while, he excitedly blew a few times:</p>
<p>"Da...di da di da...di da..."</p>
<p>He mustered all his strength, causing the veins on his head to stand out thickly, and his face to turn red, but,</p>
<p>"Damn it! It's really hard to serve! Too light and it doesn't sound! Too heavy and it doesn't sound! You rascal!"</p>
<p>Although he was resentful, for some reason, he could only hug it and walk towards his bedroom.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>After a certain national humiliation occurred a few years ago.</p>
<p>The soundly sleeping masses were suddenly awakened. All walks of life went to do their new work: holding meetings, giving speeches, issuing declarations. We, "the pillars of the nation"! Students, how could they lag behind, and also responded by forming a student army.</p>
<p>Old Chen was a big figure in our school. He relied on his魄力 to occupy the position of chairman of the student union of this school, and was very at ease: there was always no meeting that didn't assign him to the post, although his stomach was full of straw. Now it was even easier for him to get the qualification of a preparation member of the student army in his imagination.</p>
<p>The first step was to issue a notice:</p>
<p>"Foreign insults are imminent...Arm yourselves...Each person must pay 20 yuan for the uniform fee, and all procedures for measurement and manufacture will be handled by this preparation member..."</p>
<p>Student Army Preparation Member Chen 乂乂"</p>
<p>Then, through his flexible diplomatic means, he had a negotiation with the principal. Result: "Suspend classes for three days to prepare for all matters of the student army." He walked into the reading room with excitement, flipping through the advertisements in the movie theater. Thinking:</p>
<p>"I should see what's showing in Beijing today?"</p>
<p>··················</p>
<p>Three days of commotion: paying fees, measuring uniforms, measuring feet to make leather boots.</p>
<p>Two weeks passed. All the students in the school wore a set of gray cloth uniforms and a pair of calfskin boots bought for twenty yuan, and began training on the parade ground. Old Chen himself took on the task of the bugle. It is said: "The bugle of an army is the soul of all the soldiers of the army: it can make the enemy lose their courage, it can make us strive to charge, it can make... Ah! Really, ah! The most important one!" In fact, compared with others, the bugler has fewer times to go to the parade ground; and in the quiet morning, like this: "Da di da di da" blowing a few times, causing the students to wake up in their sleep, they must be thinking:</p>
<p>"Ah! How hard-working! In such cold and early weather, he is already training his bugle calls"</p>
<p>Isn't it easy to imprint a good image in people's minds?</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Mr. Sun, a military training instructor specially invited from the 乂乂 Military Academy, also came to the school. Although Mr. Sun was from Hubei, he had a short, thin figure and did not look very mighty.丨Aha! No, no! This is a fine, short, and capable figure, which is very much needed on the battlefield. Also, the short, fuzzy hair on his forehead does not fall backwards like other long hair, but stands upright and precarious. Also, large glasses, and a fountain pen with a pink rod. Also, the round and bell-shaped badges tinkled as he walked, like a pet Pekingese dog.</p>

<h3>Children and National Goods</h3>
<p>— Pan Yangfen</p>
<p>Montessori is an expert in children's education: She said: "The greatest power of education is the two words 'habit'. To develop the best habits in children, one must start by building a good environment." Now everyone knows and is enthusiastic about advocating national goods, but children's habits have not yet been developed, and the environment for children to happily use national goods has not yet been built.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dewey said: "The greatest effect of educating children lies in using opportunities to make children participate at any time, unconsciously making them develop a habit that they have to do." Now everyone knows and is enthusiastic about advocating national goods, but children's opportunities have not yet been used, and children's opportunities to participate in the national goods movement have not yet been tried.</p>
<p>I went to Dalian the year before last, and it happened that the Japanese were holding a children's goods exhibition there. The exhibits included clothing, toys, bedding, tableware, stationery, and sanitary products. Not a single item was imported, every stitch and thread, every piece of paper, was made of domestic raw materials and domestic products. Every day, one or two thousand children participated, some supervised by teachers, some led by parents. There were written advertisements, explanations by special personnel, and hospitality by women. They were excited and the whole city was ecstatic. After I returned, I greatly admired them, thinking that the saying "ten years of breeding, ten years of teaching" had been learned cleverly by the Japanese. But the Chinese are really disappointing. Every year there is Children's Day, but it's just opening ceremonies, writing a few articles, and decorating the excitement. What practical effect can be achieved? Congratulations, this year's Children's Day in the National Goods Year is actually very different from before. The China National Goods Company has held a children's amusement market, and the Shanghai National Goods Company has set up a children's park. Congratulations, children's happiness is here, because children are the source of the nation. When children are happy, the country is happy, and society is happy. To save the country and strengthen the race, one must start by cultivating children. To enable children to have good habits, one must start by enabling children to happily use national goods. To enable children to have opportunities to participate in patriotism, one must start by enabling children to happily use national goods. The China National Goods Company and others can collect various national goods supplies that children should use and display them using scientific methods for children to play and purchase. The National Goods Company's willingness to serve children can be regarded as a groundbreaking and beautiful feat. The National Goods Company's willingness to encourage children to love the country can be regarded as a groundbreaking grand event. I feel that many children are very lively after visiting. This kind of foundation work is worth praising and commemorating. I hope that children will take advantage of this spring break to actively participate and enthusiastically promote it. I hope that parents who love children and many teachers in elementary schools will quickly lead their children to participate, so that every child will be willing to be friends with national goods and complete the mission of this National Goods Year.</p>
<p>National Goods Discussion</p>
<h3>The Internal Organizational Chain of National Goods Factories Should Be</h3>
<p>— Zhou Chengxun</p>
<p>At present, the urgent task of the national goods industry in a backward and economically declining state is to practically need a sound and solid internal chain organization, and then we can talk about big names such as uniting the industry to resist imports. When we try to think about the market scene filled with foreign goods, and then think about the infighting of the industry and the inappropriate supply of the national goods industry, we can't help but feel terrified and have great hidden worries about the future of national goods.</p>
<p>The so-called "sound and solid internal chain organization" is not a vain and superficial slogan, but a necessary conclusion that we have reached from our own experience in the national goods factory. We want to quickly eliminate the shortcomings of the factory's internal business that are isolated and unrelated, and we sincerely hope that it will prosper and flourish, stabilize internally and externally, so we have put forward the following points on the connection and penetration of the two aspects of business and manufacturing in a factory to discuss with you:</p>
<p>A. Business Side to Manufacturing Side;</p>
<p>Zi, the rapid report of market demand. If a certain commodity has a broad sales market, the business side should immediately report the details to the manufacturing side and urge it to rush to produce it in order to meet market sales, so that it will not fall behind.</p>
<p>Chou: Finding a way out for sluggish goods. A factory often has many sluggish goods piled up in the warehouse. Rather than leaving them idle for a long time, it is better to quickly find a way out and sell them when the opportunity arises. Even if the selling price is lowered a bit, it is still worth it to activate finances, so the business side should take on this responsibility.</p>
<p>Yin: Complete understanding of the work process. Business personnel can explain the production situation of the goods, which can give the outside world a complete understanding, especially for orders, it is necessary to be able to estimate the delivery date, so that delivery can be made on time without damaging credibility.</p>
<p>Mao: Faithful notification of external criticism. If the outside world has fair criticism or well-intentioned guidance on the factory's goods, the business side should humbly accept it and faithfully notify the manufacturing side to make reforms.</p>
<p>B. Manufacturing Side to Business Side,</p>
<p>Zi: Full preparation of fast-selling goods. Some goods have a long-term sales channel, so there should be sufficient storage in order to maintain the turnover and reduce the loss of out-of-stock.</p>
<p>Chou: The continuous emergence of new and novel styles. Business may be quiet for a period of time due to the time of day, geography, or public sentiment. At this time, new products and new styles must be used to adjust and supplement, so that the eyes and ears of buyers can be surprised and the quiet business can be compensated. But in normal times, new products should also be made from time to time to estimate the advantages in the market first.</p>
<p>Yin: Fast and solid assembly and packaging. The goods are packed in boxes and tied into bundles. The Lu Chuan transportation is bound to be shaken badly. The manufacturing side can supervise the workers to assemble them firmly to avoid damage and shortage. This will definitely win the reputation of external trust, and being fast and agile, with supplies added as needed, will also promote beautiful external criticisms, which is very important for business.</p>
<p>Mao: Accurate reporting of inventory quantity. The quantity of inventory should be accurately reported to the business side at any time, sorted by category, to urge business personnel to act accordingly and reduce the shortcomings of too much or too little inventory.</p>
<p>The above points are just general examples, and naturally there are many that I have not thought of, but there is one point that is very necessary to supplement, that is, in daily office matters, all personnel of each department should have the concept of mutual integration, understanding, and thoroughness, so that business can proceed smoothly and all difficulties can be solved easily.</p>
<p>I think that after the above basic methods have been implemented with some effect, and with the reduction of costs and the expansion of business, and then with precise plans and the same steps to contact the industry and resist foreign goods, the results achieved may be beyond what is currently expected!</p>
<h3>Advertising Art and National Goods Business</h3>
<p>— Huimin</p>
<p>Recently, the advertising industry has gradually attracted the attention of national goods merchants, but most merchants are still not very trusting in their minds, thinking that it is a waste of money and only provides small compensation, it is better to use this sum of money for other developments to achieve greater results. I do not agree with this, because advertising can not only develop business, but also eliminate the drawbacks of partners running the streets. Its publicity power is great and it can save a part of the economy. It is indeed a sharp weapon in business. For example, the Kodak camera company in modern times spends huge sums of money on advertising, so the company can be famous all over the world and its business is booming. This is clear evidence that advertising is effective. Now, the points that have the most impact on business are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Advertising is a powerful tool for promoting goods. For example, if a certain company releases a new product, if it uses street runners and partners to promote it, the effect will not be great, and there will be errors from time to time. Now, if advertising techniques are used to state the characteristics of the goods in concise sentences and use strange words to attract social attention and needs, it is the best method of promotion.</p>
<p>(2) Advertising can determine the quality of goods and provide purchasers with a certain standard. Advertising enables buyers to be familiar with the characteristics and trademarks of a certain product. When buyers see it, they know it is a certain product and will not be deceived by counterfeiters.</p>
<p>(3) Advertising can reduce costs. Once demand is high, goods can sell well, and merchants can profit from it. When profits are high, costs can be reduced.</p>
<p>(4) Advertising can lower the market price of goods. Once the cost is light, the market price of goods will also fall as a result. The famous American hat manufacturer, E.A. Mallory &amp; Sons, has been using advertising techniques since 1906, and sales have been booming, costs have been reduced, and the market price has been reduced by 17% compared to before. Hart Schaffner &amp; Marx also used this technique, and after 15 years, the market price was half as low, and society benefited greatly from the need.</p>
<p>(5) Advertising can eliminate the fraud of street runners and partners. The world is getting worse and worse, and street runners and partners often manipulate things up and down for their own benefit, and shop owners and buyers are deceived. This not only has an impact on the store's economy, but may even damage its reputation, leading to the decline of its business. If advertising methods are used, this drawback can be avoided, and a part of the economy and credit can be preserved. The above points show that the effect of advertising art is very great. Attracting customers can directly generate wealth for the business, and reducing market prices can indirectly benefit society. This is why advertising art should be paid extreme attention to and why national goods merchants are deeply willing to adopt it.</p>
<h3>Special Sale: "China"</h3>
<p>— Qiacheng</p>
<p>Maybe you admire imported goods? Okay, let me tell you a story.</p>
<p>Vaccines are related to people's lives, and governments of all countries carry out detailed inspections. The Chinese Health Laboratory also manufactures standard products, because it is necessary to protect the lives of the people, so we must be careful.</p>
<p>However, Japanese vaccines, which were once popular in China, may have been worshiped because they were imported goods; however, when I found the words "Special Sale: China" on the small box, I suspiciously had to find a way to inquire.</p>
<p>According to a friend who studied medicine, the Japanese take special care of the Chinese, knowing that the Chinese are afraid of trouble, so they sell batches of uninspected vaccines to China. However, because they are afraid of being used by the Japanese by mistake, they added these words on the small box.</p>
<p>Maybe you admire foreign goods? Okay, please listen to my story.</p>
<h3>A Study of the Clothing of Employees in National Goods Companies</h3>
<p>— Liu Wan-gong</p>
<p>Once, the Huiluo Company held a grand fashion show to promote their clothing materials. All the materials used in the fashions were their products, and their employees also wore clothes made from their materials. This kind of advertising was very effective!</p>
<p>This time, our advocacy of national goods is not just about narrow commercial competition; it's practically a national salvation movement! It's like the vanguard of an international war. The stakes are incredibly high! Since the China National Goods Company is the only national goods stronghold in Shanghai, everything about it is related to our entire national salvation movement. Now, when we walk into the company, there's one thing that's extremely jarring: the clothing of the shop assistants and receptionists. I see many receptionists wearing the national goods company badge on their chests, dressed in Western suits and leather shoes. Granted, Western suits can be made of national goods materials, but I doubt that the materials used in the receptionists' suits are all national goods. Many of the junior shop assistants, although not wearing Western suits, also mostly use foreign materials for their clothes. I believe that Chinese silk is inherently beautiful and comfortable. However, nowadays, everyone is vying for Western clothing, and coupled with the pressure on sericulture from foreign goods, the domestic silk industry has declined to the extreme! Shouldn't we be promoting the use of domestic silk for clothing? Hasn't the government already issued orders to this effect? The national goods company should take the lead in implementing this, following the example of the Huiluo Company by holding a fashion show and replacing all the employees' Western suits with silk casual wear. If shop assistants can't wear silk, they should at least use domestic fabrics and not allow this contradictory phenomenon to give foreigners something to laugh at!</p>

<p>An Interview</p>
<h3>Interview with Tianxu Wosheng</h3>
<p>— Wu Hezhou</p>
<p>The four characters "Tianxu Wosheng" must leave a deep impression on readers. We bought a package of Invincible Brand Tooth Powder in the market, and it had the name "Tianxu Wosheng" printed on it. Therefore, everyone is eager to know who this "Tianxu Wosheng" actually is. But before everyone knew who he actually was, they all knew that he was a writer and an entrepreneur. In fact, the reason his name has attracted attention is the reputation he has earned through his lifelong efforts in "literature" and "industry." When he first started the family industrial society, he only had a few thousand dollars, and his children and family members all worked in the factory. This kind of industry that starts from a family is the most admirable.</p>
<p>When I was thirteen years old, I liked to read newspapers and magazines. When I saw Mr. "Tianxu Wosheng" in a book called "Common Sense of the Family," I was always longing for him. Later, when I arrived in Shanghai, I often read his works, which further increased my faith in him. Later, I read articles by Mr. and Mr. Yang An guiding young people in the "Jilianhui Journal," and every sentence was a criticism, so the impression in my mind was particularly deep. The most committed thing that Mr. and Mr. Yang An were devoted to was the guidance of small crafts and small-scale operations, and the introduction of ways to make a living.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth year, I was working in an old-fashioned shop in this city (at that time, my studies were over). Later, I felt that there were several places where my work here conflicted with my wishes (what was painful was that the shop sold enemy goods). Therefore, I rashly wrote a letter to Mr. Tianxu Wosheng (through the Jilianhui) to discuss it with him. As a result, he sent me a reply letter and asked me to go to his office for a talk.</p>
<p>His office was on Guohuo Road in the Nanshi, which is also inside the Family Industrial Society. When I went, I was imagining in my heart that Mr. Tianxu Wosheng must not be an old man. Later, when I met him, I saw that he was a scholar who was thinking.</p>
<p>I wasn't very good at talking, but at this time, I had to be brave and talk to him. While I was talking, I was looking around his office with my fat eyes. This was a laboratory, with all kinds of glassware. The spirits lamp was still on the writing desk and had not been moved away. I knew he had just been doing some experiments. His experimental spirit is getting higher and higher as he gets older.</p>
<p>When he spoke with satisfaction, he liked to twist his beard and smile, with a face full of spring breeze.</p>
<p>"You don't want to work in that shop? Indeed, there is a good reason for you to do so. Then, come to my place." He spoke so directly and showed me so much kindness that I was silently grateful.</p>
<p>Later, he introduced me to Mr. Li Changjue. Mr. Li was also a novelist, but at this time, he was the manager of the Invincible Brand Company and was also a very loyal person.</p>
<p>From then on, I, a young man, became an employee in his company, an old man, and it has been three and a half years now.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd like to tell you all: Mr. Tianxu Wosheng's surname is Chen, his name is Diexian, and his pseudonym is Xuyuan. He is from Hangzhou. Do you want to know the process of his success? Please read his self-authored "Business Correspondence," because this correspondence is the history of his own business process.</p>
<p>Introduction to New Industries</p>
<h3>A Factory That Utilizes Waste</h3>
<p>— Wei Yu</p>
<p>Running an enterprise is originally intended to benefit and improve people's lives. However, among the emerging industries in our country, not many truly align with the meaning of benefiting and improving people's lives. Take the textile industry, for example, which can be considered a major industry in our country over the past two decades. The amount of leftover cotton from spinning each year is very large, but few know how to utilize it. This waste cotton is often sold to foreigners at a low price to manufacture products such as blankets and surgical cotton, which are then imported back into the country. In this transfer, others reap huge profits, while we suffer a leakage. Nothing is more regrettable than this. In recent years, some people have paid attention to the use of foot flower (leftover cotton from spinning) to operate organizations. As far as I know, there are only the Minsheng Yarn Factory in Shanghai and the Tongcheng Weaving Company in Qishuyan, Changzhou. I have not had the opportunity to visit the Minsheng factory in person, so I dare not comment on its internal situation. However, I visited Tongcheng with Mr. Huang Ren, Jiang Wenyu, Wang Zhixin, and others a few days ago. Three experts in weaving machinery also accompanied us, so we gained more insights. I feel that its history, equipment, achievements, methods, etc., all arouse our great interest and satisfaction. Therefore, I will record its general outline as follows, hoping that those who are also interested in running enterprises will be pleased to know.</p>
<p>The factory is located southwest of Qishuyan, conveniently situated in the center of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line. It occupies an area of more than 160 mu, bordering the Grand Canal to the south and connecting to the railway to the north. It occupies an excellent position in terms of transportation, and the environment is particularly beautiful. Upon arriving at the site, the roads are wide and flat, with green willows lining the paths. The factory buildings stand side by side in front of the factory, including a hospital, a school, a cooperative, and a savings department, all established by the factory to benefit its employees. Although I am a layman when it comes to industry, I deeply appreciate all the facilities. Factory Director Chi Zongmo was an educator ten years ago. He told me that the factory has been established for ten years, during which it has experienced many setbacks and difficulties, even to the point where it could not pay wages on time. However, the workers remained calm and did not cause trouble for the factory. He attributed this to the fact that the factory is not located in a major city, so the workers have no bad habits. However, I believe that it is mainly due to the harmonious relationship between labor and management on a daily basis. People are not made of wood or stone; who has no conscience? If the factory treats the workers like family, fathers and sons, teachers and students, and strives to benefit them in every possible way, then the workers will treat the factory like children and students treat their parents and teachers, with only respect and love.</p>
<p>Upon entering the factory, in addition to the workshops, there are reading rooms, recreation rooms, bathrooms, flower gardens, vegetable gardens, etc. The roads in each area have names, such as Rehe Road and Jilin Road, to show that we must not forget the recovery of our national territory. Other facilities, such as the kitchen, cafeteria, reception room, and even the restrooms, are clean and tidy. My fellow travelers all praised it, saying, "This is a factory that has been turned into a school, and it is even cleaner than a school."</p>
<p>The factory is divided into cotton processing, dyeing, spinning, weaving, fluffing, and ironing departments, which are arranged in order according to their interconnected relationships. The machinery is purchased from famous German factories, and the factory buildings are built under the guidance of German technicians, so safety, hygiene, and work are all taken into consideration. Ordinary yarn factories have a special odor and flying floss, which this factory does not have. This is due to the different structure of the machinery and buildings. In ordinary factories, the workers' clothes are dirty, and their faces are soiled. In this factory, all employees wear uniforms, and their faces are clean and beautiful. This is due to the thoroughness of the equipment. The products include 4-count and 6-count coarse yarn, which, according to the experts who went with us, are of excellent quality and are very suitable for making socks and blankets. In terms of woven fabrics, there are velvet blankets, military blankets, scarves, tablecloths, car blankets, as well as surgical cotton and gauze. The colors and pile are no different from imported products, but the price is particularly low, thanks to the unremitting research spirit of Mr. Chi and others over the past ten years. Therefore, whether in terms of form, quality, or work, there are special achievements. In fact, everything is made from foot flower and discarded waste that we have abandoned. After being rotated by the machine several times, it becomes an extremely beautiful and high-quality product, which is truly a miraculous feat of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>The factory has been established for ten years and has experienced many hardships, but the people in charge have been determined and have never been discouraged. After seven or eight years of hard work, they have achieved today's results. At present, there are no problems in terms of product, sales, and factory system methods, which is admirable. I hope that Mr. Chi will further develop his three fears (not afraid of failure, not afraid of trouble, not afraid of hardship) and his enthusiastic spirit (all the above can be found in Mr. Chi's booklet) and actively find ways to expand. I also hope that those who are enthusiastic about industry will cooperate with him, support each other, and help each other. I don't understand industry, but this kind of factory, in any case, deserves praise and support. The more this kind of industry develops, the less economic invasion from foreign countries there will be.</p>
<p>National Goods News</p>
<h3>A Chongqing National Goods Center Worth Introducing (Part 1)</h3>
<p>The Chongqing China National Goods Center was initiated by a few enthusiastic advocates of national goods in Chongqing. In June of this year, the initiators publicly elected Tong Shaosheng and Chen Shujing to go to Shanghai to investigate and negotiate. After returning to Chongqing, they held repeated preparatory meetings and decided to organize the China National Goods Center Co., Ltd. with a registered capital of 100,000 yuan. It was formally established on October 1, 1932. Subsequently, they submitted documents to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for registration and to the municipal government for filing. The address of the center is on Xiadouyou Street in the city. The storefront was also renovated. Formal business operations began. It is said that the total turnover has already reached 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Recently, Manager Chen came to Shanghai again to further negotiate with various factories, with even better results. This is worth introducing to readers. The purpose of the center's establishment is twofold: one is to promote national goods through positive efforts. In the past three years, the value of imported goods in Sichuan Province has averaged 13 million taels per year, of which foreign goods account for about 80%. Profits and rights have been flowing out of the country in large amounts. The general public only chants the high-sounding tune of national goods saving the country, but there has been no concrete method for implementation. Therefore, the center came into being to promote national goods in practice. This kind of enterprise is still a novelty in Sichuan, and it is nothing less than the first page in the future history of commercial development in Chongqing (or Sichuan). The other is to improve the commercial system in Sichuan. Sichuan merchants mostly rely on brokers to import goods, and their methods and habits are far from perfect. For example, the process of purchasing goods in other ports involves layers of intermediaries: manufacturers, brokers, brokers (insurance rebates, commission rebates, inflated prices, miscellaneous fees, broker payments), customs brokers (customs fees, commission rebates, inflated prices, letter fees), wholesalers, retailers, and consumers. Not only does this increase costs, but there are also cases of brokers collapsing and escaping, which has led to a decline in the credit of Sichuan merchants in Shanghai. Therefore, the center has simplified the procurement process to manufacturers, customs fees, insurance fees, shipping fees, the center's name (wholesalers), retailers (large consumers), and direct consumers. This can reduce several similar customs checkpoints. Costs can be reduced, and procedures are simpler, which is a great convenience for both buyers and consumers.</p>
<p>As a result of Mr. Tong and Chen's negotiations with manufacturers in Shanghai, they received support from the China Production and Sales Cooperative Association. Currently, there are more than 50 well-known factories.</p>
<p>The center also has a "Preface" printed, which describes the meaning of its creation in detail. It is also reproduced here:</p>
<p>"Today's China is extremely poor, weak, blind, and chaotic. The reason for this is that economic undertakings cannot prosper. The efforts of foreigners are enough to constitute a phenomenon of aggression and hinder our progress. However, merely moaning, scolding, complaining, and resisting, without studying the ways of self-respect, self-reliance, and fair competition, can never save the situation. The way to save the situation is to first emphasize the improvement of agriculture, the development of industry, and the smooth operation of commerce. To achieve this goal, we must promote the national goods industry. For example, the supply of raw materials, the improvement of manufacturing, the reduction of costs, and the cooperation of consumption, so that agricultural products can be utilized, industries can flourish, imports can be reduced, and wealth can be expected to be balanced.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been little promotion of the national goods industry, and the reasons for its lack of development are fourfold: (1) The habit of Chinese people to use foreign goods, (2) The lack of external support for factories, (3) The failure of consumers to provide guidance, and (4) The failure of distributors to make efforts to promote them.</p>
<p>To treat this disease, we must earnestly implement the following matters: (1) Chinese people should use national goods as much as possible, (2) Factories should use the latest talents and knowledge as much as possible, (3) Consumers should contribute ways to improve as much as possible, and (4) Distributors should sincerely promote sales as much as possible.</p>
<p>In this way, consumer goods can replace some imported goods, production costs can be gradually reduced, quality can be gradually improved, and the credit of national goods can be gradually established.</p>
<h3>German Encourages Children to Love National Goods</h3>
<p>— Zhao Peng</p>
<p>Germans love national goods. I have heard their elders warn their children: "Use German pens, German ink, and German paper. Do not take a single bit from foreign goods, lest the money of our country flow abroad." What are the thoughts of our people when they read this?</p>
<p>Visiting Notes</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Children's Amusement Market Held by the China National Goods Company (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>If you were to conduct a global survey, almost every country has a celebration for "Children's Day." On that day, they have very grand ceremonies and very progressive performances. In our country, however, we only started having this holiday last year.</p>
<p>The Shanghai China Child Welfare Association is dedicated to children's happiness. Recognizing that all countries in the world have Children's Day, they resolutely decided to create one in March of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, and requested the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to forward it to the Municipal Government, which then submitted it to the National Government for approval. Thus, our beloved Children's Day was set on April 4th of each year, and commemorative measures for Children's Day were also promulgated. How happy should our country's children be to have such an interesting holiday! I know that especially the children of Shanghai, in this prosperous city, are so fortunate!</p>
<p>The China National Goods Company is the most complete national goods company in the country, born in the year of national goods. During the second week of commemorating this great Children's Day, they held a "Children's Amusement Market" in the southern building on the second floor, hoping that the children of the city would take this opportunity to thoroughly understand national goods and have a chance to compare their merits.</p>
<p>The people in charge held more than ten meetings for this "Children's Amusement Market" and decided to do it on a large scale, so that the children of the city would deeply imprint it in their minds. They hired Lin Kanghou's son (16 years old), Zhifu, as the mayor of the "Children's Amusement Market," and Huang Ren's daughter (10 years old), Qin Hui, and Pan Yangyao's daughter (9 years old), Shiwei, as the deputy mayors.</p>
<p>In their company, starting from the Pine and Cypress Archway at the entrance, and inside the entrance and the market, there were slogans such as "Children! Please go to the Children's Amusement Market." "Parents with children. Please go to the Children's Amusement Market together." etc., with the words "in the south" written below and an arrow pointing the way. Such slogans were posted all the way to the "Children's Amusement Market."</p>
<p>On the morning of Children's Day, April 4th, I went with my sheep (son) to their "Children's Amusement Market." We walked up the grand escalator in the center of their entrance, turned left, then turned right and walked straight east to the silk and satin department, then turned right again, and we arrived directly at the "Children's Amusement Market."</p>
<p>Clear signs, dazzling the eyes of the visitors, absorbed us in. My son and I walked into the "Children's Amusement Market" and were on "Zhongshan Avenue." As we went in, "Zhongshan Park" was in front of us. On the wall, there was a horizontal sign saying "Increase Children's Knowledge." A statue of the great founder of the Republic of China, Sun Zhongshan, stood solemnly, inspiring reverence. There were countless鲜丽 flowers, strange trees, and more. The "Animal Garden" had "deer," "porcupines," "gray cranes," "monkeys," "white parrots," "badgers," "bears," "alligators," "wild rabbits," "golden dogs," "hawks," etc. On that small mountain, there was a "God of Longevity" standing there, with "Baile Cave" above, and swimming waterfowl and sailing ships in the stream below. It was very能引起 to引起 the children's joy. The "Music Seat" broadcast悠扬动听 and動聽 songs. The method of the "Library" was even more precise, with small bookshelves, tables, chairs, stools, etc. The横条horizontal banner banner written on it said "啓發Enlighten children's intelligence." Children's favorite reading materials were published by the Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, World Book Company, Children's Magazine, etc. Many children were standing or sitting and flipping through them, and some picked them out to buy and take home. I bought my son a few children's picture books, and he happily accepted them.</p>
<p>After leaving the library, we went to "Oowo Road." How strange is this road name? At the entrance, we saw a big rooster with electric lights射人and電炬 shooting from its eyes, making it feel very威武 majestic. Attached below were a few sentences: "Old公鷄rooster, 喔喔啼crowing; Little小朋友friends, 早早起get up early,振精神lift your spirits,健身體and build your body." When小朋友friends walk by, everyone always reads it once. The "Mayor's Office" was on "Oowo Road." The utensils in the "大菜間kitchen," "休息室rest room," "會客室reception room," and "臥室bedroom" were all specially made儿童children's small utensils. The卧臥室 especially came to 引人入勝be especially charming, with two小小的 small beds,小小棉被small quilts on the bed,小小枕頭small pillows,小小被單small sheets, etc. My sheep said to me; "爸爸dad!我上I go to to Sleep a bit okay吗?” 我笑了起來I笑笑, at at At at the at The at The at at.</p>
<p>Spare time</p>
<p>The China National Goods Guidance Institute's Mobile Exhibition gathered famous factories in Shanghai on April 9 to hold a national goods exhibition in Songjiang. This kind of in-depth work among the people is highly commendable. Ladies and gentlemen along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway can take advantage of this bright spring season to travel together, both to take this trip and enjoy the scenery of Yunjian, and to take this opportunity to promote national goods and encourage the local habit of using domestic products. Mr. Zhao Bingren, the director-general of the association, said that this kind of exhibition is not limited to one place. After the Songjiang exhibition, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, such as Hangzhou Xiashi, the Shanghai-Ningbo Railway, such as Qingpu Kunshan, the Jinpu Railway, such as Xuzhou Bengbu, etc., are all in the process of preparation. After the work in one place is completed, they will proceed to other places. If you do this, you are guaranteed to have good results at the end of the year of National Goods, which can be manifested. Congratulations, congratulations! This is very valuable work in the year of national goods.</p>
<p>Paddy rice transplanter The inventor of the early stage of the rice transplanter, Mr. Zhang Wenping, has Mr. Chen Jingyu Zhang Jiqiang, etc., who have come to ask for his address to communicate with him, hoping that Mr. Zhang will tell him as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Tui Bei Tu (Back-Pushing Diagram)</h3>
<p>— He Jia Gan</p>
<p>The meaning of "Tui Bei" that I use here is to say: to speculate on the future from the opposite side.</p>
<p>In last month's "Free Talk," there was an article "Viewing Positive Articles from the Opposite." This is terrifying text. Because when this conclusion is reached, it must have gone through many painful experiences and seen many pitiful sacrifices. The herbalist picks up his pen and writes: Arsenic, highly poisonous. The words are only four, but he knows for sure that this thing has poisoned several lives.</p>
<p>There is a joke in the alleys: Someone buried thirty taels of silver in the ground, fearing that people would know, so he erected a wooden board on it and wrote, "No silver thirty taels here." The neighbor, Er'a, therefore dug it away, also fearing that people would discover it, so he added a sentence on the other side of the wooden board, "Neighbor Er'a did not steal." This is teaching people to "view positive articles from the opposite."</p>
<p>But the articles we see every day cannot be so simple. There are those who say they will do it clearly, but don't actually do it; there are those who say they won't do it clearly, but actually want to do it; there are those who say they will do it this way clearly, but actually do it that way; there are those who actually want to do it this way themselves, but say that others want to do it this way; there are those who don't say a word, but actually do it. However, there are also those who say this way and actually do it this way: the difficulty lies in this place.</p>
<p>For example, take the important news reported in the newspapers in recent days:</p>
<p>1. The XX army fought a bloody battle in XX, killing XX XXXX enemy.</p>
<p>2. XX talks: determined not to directly negotiate with Japan, still does not change its original intention, resists to the end.</p>
<p>3. Fangze came to China, reportedly for private matters.</p>
<p>4. The Communist Party colluded with Japan, and the pseudo-central government has sent cadres XX to Japan to negotiate.</p>
<p>5. XX XXXX·········</p>
<p>If you treat them all as opposite articles, it would be too scary. But there are also "More than a hundred straw sheds and boats on Moganshan Road caught fire" and "XX XXXX cheap shell have been available for four days" etc. There are大概about no need to推 back to“ push back” the.</p>
<p>I heard that the Tui Bei Tu was originally accurate, but a certain emperor in a certain dynasty, fearing that it would confuse people's hearts, added some fakes to it, thus making it impossible to predict. Only after the facts prove it will people suddenly understand.</p>
<p>We can only wait and see the facts, fortunately, it will probably not be long, it will not go beyond this year.</p>
<h3>Father and Son</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>In Turgenev's famous work "Father and Son," there is a heartbreaking passage where Nikolai says to his brother: "Brother, do you know what I just remembered? Once, I argued with our mother about something; she flew into a rage and refused to listen to me. Finally, I said to her: 'Of course you can't understand me, we are people of two different eras.' She was extremely angry; but I thought: 'What can be done? This pill is bitter, but I have to swallow it.' Now it's our turn, our descendants can say to us: 'You are not of our era, swallow your pill!'" This kind of comedy, played out in countless ways, always has a painful aspect. "Ah! The lotus seed is bitter, because he is already old!"</p>
<p>In modern China, many young people have become reactionaries. Killing and imprisonment have not alleviated this serious situation. Perhaps it is a divine punishment, and those 108 demonic stars have descended again. But the situation is very peculiar: Mr. Dai Jitao has a nephew in prison, Mr. Chen Shuren has a son who was beheaded, and Mr. Liao Zhongkai's son was recently arrested. It is said that Emperor Yao also had a rebellious son, Danzhu, abroad. Why does every great family give birth to a demonic star? Ancient sages, King Wen had Ji Dan, Yu had Qi, and they begot auspicious children. Modern sages, however, only have Shang Jun and Guan Cai. Isn't heaven too biased? Perhaps Shun and Yao are also sighing to each other in the afterlife: "What can be done? This pill is bitter, but we have to swallow it!"</p>
<p>Some say: The sage wrote the Book of Changes, at the beginning of the hexagram of Qian: "If the father's errors are corrected, the son will be free from blame. Auspicious in the end." The image says: "Correcting the father's errors means carrying on the father's will." At one point, Yao gritted his teeth, thinking that Danzhu was undermining his legacy. Who knew that after he ascended to heaven, Danzhu would accomplish great things, bringing much honor to him. On the road to the Yellow Springs, he would open his mouth and laugh heartily: "This is my family's prodigy!" Therefore, the sage said: "A son who can correct his father's mistakes is a good son! The father enjoys the glory of his son and has a good ending!" Therefore, Nikolai comforts Paul: "Now it's our turn, our descendants can say to us: 'You are not of our era, swallow your pill!'"</p>
<p>Forty years ago, Ye Dehui wrote "Yi Jiao Cong Bian" to scold Kang Youwei; thirty years ago, the country's scholar-officials attacked Mr. Sun Yat-sen; ten years ago, Lin Qinnan and many defenders of morality attacked Chen Duxiu and Hu Shih. Now, who are the defenders of morality attacking? "The great river flows eastward, washing away the heroic figures of the ages!" The old man Time is truly an unforgiving critic, he kicks you aside!</p>
<h3>Seamstress of Poverty</h3>
<p>— Peng Xuezhen</p>
<p>The people living near Phoenix Street haven't seen the seamstress of poverty and her child for two months.</p>
<p>This situation has continued for three years: every morning, the poor woman, sitting against the wall on the street, carrying a basket of rags and a toddler, would come from the west and return to the west at dusk.</p>
<p>Every day, the woman waited for customers with eyes as wide as a hungry hawk: shop assistants, street vendors, single men in small houses facing the street... She never asked for too much and sewed very carefully. She often said: their money is as hard-earned as hers, and poor people shouldn't cheat other poor people.</p>
<p>When the autumn wind blows, people shrink back and are too lazy to move, so they don't think about mending anything. The woman was idle and restless under the eaves, looking at the needles and thread sleeping in the broken basket, a deep sorrow often appearing on her face -- no food.</p>
<p>The child, sitting on a small stool, rubbed his red hands, using the warm air from his mouth to thaw the cold. "Mommy, hungry..." One sound, two sounds, like a snake, painfully gnawing at the woman's heart.</p>
<p>"Be a good boy and sit still, Mommy will buy you a cake later." The child listened to his mother's coaxing and was silent for a while, smiling sadly, but hunger couldn't be coaxed, and only a moment later, it was "Mom, hungry..." again!</p>
<p>Searching through her belongings, she only had enough to buy a large cake to stuff in the child's mouth: "Eat slowly, be careful not to choke," she frowned, thinking, if only the north wind could fill his belly...</p>
<p>When chatting, people heard her say: "The famine in Jiangbei drove us here; people said this place is paradise, where there is good fortune to enjoy, who knew that we couldn't even earn enough for a full meal! His father pulls a rickshaw, and in the winter, he only has the wind to drink!"</p>
<p>The previous month, the little apprentice from the cake shop brought a message from outside, saying that when he was selling near the thatched shed outside the city, someone was crying and shouting, and the voice sounded just like the seamstress of poverty. When he got closer, he saw her child placed on a bench in front of the door, a white cloth tied around his little head, staring blankly with his small eyes.</p>
<p>In the spring, the seamstress of poverty returned, but alone. Several circles of white rope were added to her hair bun, her thin face was even thinner, and her eyes had lost their luster.</p>
<p>People looked at her with pity, wondering about the disappearance of her child.</p>
<p>"The child? Sold, sold him to buy a coffin for his father. Can I afford to raise him? Poor people shouldn't have children!"</p>
<p>Braving the wind and rain, the seamstress of poverty endlessly came and went from morning to night,</p>

<h3>Crossroads of the Times and Love</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, the attic in our house will be vacant soon. Are you really going to move in after waiting two more days?"</p>
<p>"Because there are Japanese people coming and going often on my side, it's too noisy. Recently, two or three more Japanese have come. I feel disgusted when I see them.</p>
<p>I didn't even go back to sleep last night."</p>
<p>"Then, you should move over quickly."</p>
<p>"How can I if there is no house?"</p>
<p>"Live with us temporarily. What does it matter for just two or three days?"</p>
<p>"Live in the same room with you?"</p>
<p>Haiquan was startled, widening his eyes to ask.</p>
<p>"There's a cot, what are you afraid of? It can be put away during the day."</p>
<p>"······························"</p>
<p>Haiquan didn't answer for a moment. But he was somewhat surprised by this woman's peculiar and bold attitude.</p>
<p>He and Qiuying walked upstairs.</p>
<p>"Where did you go for so long?"</p>
<p>Shiguang said fiercely, probably because he was so hungry.</p>
<p>"Hey! That's strange! You're still asking me where I went! You told me to go myself! If I didn't go to those gentlemen's place, would there be money to buy these things?················"</p>
<p>"What about the child's medicine?"</p>
<p>Seeing Shiguang's expression, it seemed he was afraid that Qiuying would say too much and all the secrets would be heard by outsiders. Feeling embarrassed, he quickly changed the subject.</p>
<p>"Those gentlemen will bring it later, I asked them to."</p>
<p>"Look, you don't care about the child's affairs, you only buy those things!"</p>
<p>"What does it matter for a little cold and cough? There are still a few baby cough pills at home. Cough medicine is taken at night. Those gentlemen will bring it in the afternoon, what's the rush? Qiuying argued with her husband while changing her clothes.</p>
<p>"It would save those gentlemen a trip if you bought it yourself and brought it back! You always do things so troublesome!······"</p>
<p>"Not troublesome at all! I asked them to buy the pills and cough medicine because I wanted them to come. If I ask them, they can't refuse to come.············ Oh my! Mr. Lin, why are you just staring at me? It's so embarrassing."</p>
<p>Hearing Qiuying's words, Haiquan's face turned red, and he quickly lowered his head, while secretly looking at Cao Shiguang's attitude at that moment. Because he did indeed steal a glance at Qiuying's figure in her underwear.</p>
<p>"Lao Lin!"</p>
<p>Hearing Shiguang's call, Haiquan's chest suddenly thumped. He thought, is Shiguang really going to start negotiating with me about this matter?</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>He slightly raised his head to look at Shiguang, who was still holding the child.</p>
<p>, sitting on a small stool, sewing carefully, her lonely shadow cast on the ground. People greeted her coming in the sunshine and watched her carrying her basket home in the evening mist, feeling that her back view was gradually becoming smaller and smaller, and her steps were so weak and slow.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts from the Humble Hut</h3>
<p>— Zizhan</p>
<p>(14) The Earliest Anti-Filial Piety Theorist</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Juren, once described stories of anti-filial piety in the Taosheng Weekly. After the May Fourth Movement in Beijing, the ideological world underwent a dramatic change, and students were the most active. The First Normal Schools of Hunan and Zhejiang provinces were both centers of the new ideological movement at that time. Shi Cuntong of Zhejiang School and Mao Zedong of Hunan School were figures who emerged at that time. Shi Cuntong wrote a "Theory of Anti-Filial Piety," which was greatly criticized by the conservatives of Zhejiang. Juren was a classmate of Shi and said that Shi was usually restrained and was valued by teachers of national studies who emphasized morality. Who knew that he would be so astonishing when he spoke out? I said; The earliest person to express anti-filial sentiment was also someone who highly valued filial piety, and that was Kong Rong. During the May Fourth Movement, Lin Qinnan once wrote to Cai Zimin, severely criticizing Hu Shih, Chen Duxiu, and others for advocating vernacular Chinese to the point of overturning Confucius and Mencius and destroying ethics. He also said that the theory of anti-filial piety originated with Kong Rong. Mr. Cai replied, roughly saying Kong Rong's theory of anti-filial piety:</p>
<p>What kind of bond should there be between father and son? In its essence, it is driven by lust! What is the relationship between son and mother? It is like an object placed in a bottle, once it is out, they are separated!</p>
<p>This came from Lu Cui's false accusation. Lu's character is not worth mentioning. I believe that although Lu Cui flattered the Cao clan and acted according to their wishes, thus framing Kong Rong, Kong Rong and Mi Heng were both known for their unrestrained speech. Lu's accusation may not be entirely unfounded. Perhaps Kong Rong was angered by the Cao clan's abuse of power, destruction of reputation, and emphasis on deceit, thus being provoked to make such extreme statements? According to old books, Kong Rong was indeed a staunch defender of morality and a proponent of filial piety. The Eighty-fifth volume of the Arts and Literature Classified by Subject records:</p>
<p>When Kong Wenju was the Prime Minister of Beihai, someone was mourning his father's death, weeping beside the tomb, but his expression was not emaciated, so Wenju killed him. Another's mother was sick with malaria and wanted to eat new wheat, but there was none at home, so he stole ripe wheat from his neighbor and presented it to her. When Wenju heard of it, he specially praised him, saying: "If there is none, come and ask; do not steal again." He did not punish the theft because he thought he was diligent in attending to his mother's hunger; he killed the one who wept because he thought his form was sorrowful but his heart was not.</p>
<p>Kong Rong's reward for true filial piety and punishment for false filial piety were so extreme, and his intentions were good. Furthermore, Yan Kejun compiled "Complete Prose of the Jin Dynasty," Volume Forty-Nine, citing Fu Xuan's "Supplement to the Book of Master Fu":</p>
<p>At the end of the Han Dynasty, there was a man named Guan Qiuyang who traveled with his younger brother and a companion to escape the chaos. It rained and snowed, and they ran out of food. He said to his younger brother: "If we don't eat the companion now, all three of us will die." So he and his brother killed him and obtained food to reach home. Later, he was pardoned and found not guilty. Can this person be called a virtuous man? Kong Wenju said: "Guan Qiuyang cherished the remains left by his ancestors, and there is no harm in eating the companion." Xun Shizhong objected, saying: "Qiuyang killed a man for his own survival, shouldn't he be punished?" Wenju said: "This companion was not a former friend. If Guan Zhong ate Bao Shu, or Gong Yu ate Wang Yang, that would be wrong. The one killed was like a talking bird or beast. If a dog bites a civet, and a civet bites a parrot, what is so strange? In the past, Chong'er longed for the Qi woman and wanted to eat Hu Yan, and Shusun Ao was angry with the Chu army and wanted to eat Wu Can. Even the anger of the virtuous and wise made them want to devour people, let alone those who were in dire straits?"</p>
<p>This is Kong Rong's theory of eating people with ritual. It is a pity that it was not seen by Wu Yu, who opposed Confucius and ritual, otherwise, his article "The Rituals that Eat People" would have one more piece of evidence.</p>

<h3>Financial Futures Silver Prices Rise, Margin Falls Ten Dollars and Six Cents</h3>
<p>Guang Clan Releases Over Two Thousand Taels</p>
<p>After the gold market rose the day before yesterday, unexpectedly, this morning's foreign cables from London showed that both near and far-term big bars and New York silver prices were unchanged. Although the exchange rates between British and American currencies fell by 6.25 and 8.125, respectively, the futures silver price on the Gold Exchange rose by 1/100 and 3/100 of a cent. Private cables rose by 0.125, and American cotton rose by 6 points. The opening price for raw gold was 912 yuan, then it rose to 923 yuan. The Guang clan immediately sold 420 taels, then retreated to 890 yuan. Yuan Maoyong bought, so the opening price in the morning was 1090.5 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened hard. At this time, although there was no trading, the trend continued to loosen. The Guang clan vigorously sold off. The July American dollar, at 29.5625 yuan, was once difficult to sell, and retreated to 1085.5 yuan. Afterwards, it gradually stabilized. The appetite of the banks was also good. The market then stabilized as banks traded American dollars for July delivery among themselves, which had risen to 29.4375 yuan, and then rose to 1091.5 yuan, but the trend still declined. The July American dollar at 29.5 yuan was difficult to sell. The banks slightly reduced their near-term positions, so the closing price retreated to 1087.6 yuan. It can be seen that although the process during the half-day was low, the market was stable, and the appetite of the banks was good. The Guang clan released a total of more than two thousand taels. The premium rate was 26 yuan (dealer purchase price). The swap discount was 13-14 yuan. The half-day market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 1090.5 yuan, 7.7 yuan lower than the previous closing price. The raw gold opened at 90 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened with the near-term British exchange rate at 1 shilling and 8.25 pence, 0.125 pence harder than the previous close. The American exchange rate was 28.8125 yuan, also 0.125 yuan looser than the previous close. Initially, it fluctuated around 90 yuan. When the American dollar for May delivery in the foreign exchange market could be settled at 29.0625 yuan, Shunli first sold to 9 yuan, and Hengyu Zhifengyong sold even further to 8 yuan. Then the American dollar for July delivery was at 4375, and the banks were willing to offer. Hengxing vigorously sold off, so the foreign exchange market hardened. At this point, the American dollar for July delivery at 29.5 yuan was also difficult to sell. Shunli Bingxing sold again, and it fell to 6.2 yuan. Chunyuan Yonglai bought, rising to 7.8 yuan. Then the brokers raised the American dollar for July delivery by 5625. Similarly, Hengxing's willingness to sell was still strong, and the American dollar for July delivery at 5625 was still difficult to sell, so it fell to 1085.5 yuan. Huabi then raised the American dollar for July delivery by 5625, which was reduced by the fellow dealers, and advanced the futures margin. Dadecheng bought taels in the market, rising to over 7 yuan. Zhifengyong bought even further, rising to 8.5 yuan. Hengyu came up to buy taels, two yuan less again, at 6.5 yuan. Yifeng Yonghongli bought, still hovering over 7 yuan. Qian Changxiang Yongfeng competed to buy, and it rose back to over 8 yuan. At this time, Hengxing's selling enthusiasm did not stop, and it sold vigorously from time to time, and the trend still declined. However, the foreign exchange market did not loosen again. Citibank reduced the American dollar for July delivery by 5625. Qingfa Yonglai bought, but due to Hengxing's limited trading, it was unable to rise. Citibank reduced the American dollar for this month's delivery at 29 yuan, and there was no upward momentum for a while, standing at around 8 yuan. When Hengyu Fuyu inclined to buy, it began to rise back. Magary raised the American dollar for July delivery by half a yuan. Yuan Maoyong Daxingyong competed to buy, and it jumped to over 90 yuan, at 0.05 yuan. HSBC's posted exchange rates were revealed to be unchanged for shillings, and 0.125 yuan higher for American dollars. Hengxing still came to sell taels. Datong sold to Huabi the American dollar for May delivery at 0625, gradually retreating to within 90 yuan, falling to around 8 yuan. Pangen reduced the American dollar for July delivery by half a yuan. Huabi and Zhejiang both ate 3125 for June delivery. Dadecheng Wanxing both bought in, and Shengda also came to sell at this time, so it retreated to 87.5 yuan. Zhejiang consecutively bought the American dollar for May delivery by 125. Ruixing Fuyu came up to buy in, and it began to rise back. Magary raised the American dollar for July delivery by half a yuan. Zhifengyong advanced to over 9 yuan. Citibank also raised July by half a yuan. Zhaofengchang bought in and pierced through to over 90 yuan. At this time, the July American dollar at half a yuan was already difficult to settle. Huabi and Holland traded the American dollar for July delivery at 4375. Qian Changxiang vigorously paid, and it rose to 1091.5 yuan. Hengyu sold off, and it retreated to within 90 yuan again. The July American dollar at half a yuan seemed difficult to sell, and it was at 9.2 yuan. Raw gold hedging advanced to 90.02 yuan, as Magary raised the American dollar for July delivery by half a yuan yesterday. Citibank sold the American dollar for June delivery at 25, and it was difficult to stand at over 90 yuan, falling by more than 2 yuan, reaching 7.8 yuan. At this time, retail investors were all paying in, and the market was also flat. When HSBC also raised the American dollar for July delivery by half a yuan, Yuan Maoyong slightly bought, and it rose again to 90.05 yuan. However, the trend was not stable. Citibank reduced the American dollar for June delivery by 25 again. Hengyu sold first, and Qingfa Yong Yuanshengyong also sold, falling to 87.4 yuan, as Shanghai sold the American dollar for this month's delivery at 9375 to Huabi. Fuchang then bought, which was delayed for a long time, and the noon closing price was 1087.6 yuan. The market was closed in the afternoon on Wednesday. It was slightly better after the closing, so raw gold was taken at 8 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the half-day was 1091.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 1085.5 yuan, with a difference of 6 yuan. The result was a decrease of 10.6 yuan compared with the previous closing.</p>
<p>The posted price, due to HSBC's American exchange rate rising by 0.125, was calculated at 28.5 yuan. Taking the 23.827 alloy price of 1169.2 yuan as strong, the closing price was about 81 yuan. If the 24,000 alloy price of 1177.7 yuan is strong, the closing price is about 90 yuan, 5 yuan more than the previous close. This month's registration is 1102 yuan, and May's is 1088 yuan. The morning replenishment was 1100 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was still lively. In summary, Hengxing Shengda Shunli Yuanshengyong Bingxing Hengyu Xixing Yong and others all sold, and Yuan Maoyong Dadecheng Yifeng Yonghongli Qian Changxiang Yongfeng Ruixing Fuyu Zhifengyong Zhaofengchang Qingfa Yong Fuchang all bought. The Dalian gang Shunli sold, and Wanxing slightly bought in, but there were not many transactions. The Guang gang Hengxing sold 1300-1400 taels, and bought dozens. Shengda sold more than 700. A total of 19,530 taels of May futures were traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday's premium rate was extremely flat, and no formal transactions were seen. The initial opening price in the market was around 26 yuan and 27 yuan. Generally, the selling price was 29 yuan, and the buying price was 26 yuan. Dealers traded among themselves at between 26 and 27 yuan.</p>
<p>The swap was also flat, and the discount was slightly cheaper, mainly due to a lack of short positions. Huiyuan discounted 21 taels each to the spot number Yingfeng Heng and Dadecheng, for 13.5 yuan. Chunyuan Yong also had a long position requiring a price of 15 yuan, but there were no counterparts. Yichang also had positions, but the price did not match. Ruixing discounted 70 taels to Dakang, for 14 yuan. Finally, Chunyuan Yong advanced at 13 yuan, which was Dakang's discount, and 70 taels were traded (raw gold was traded at 13.8 yuan for 28 taels from No. 31 to No. 77). There were still 4732 taels of April futures remaining.</p>
<p>In April, Dafeng Heng delivered 210 taels of government bonds, Dadecheng 91 taels, Qian Changxiang 21 taels, and Yongfeng 7 taels. Tongfeng Heng received 231 taels, Runchang Yong 42 taels, and Runchang Yu Hengxing each 21 taels, and Zhifeng Heng Hengyu each 7 taels. A total of 329 taels were received and delivered.</p>

However, because the Guang gang immediately sold raw gold, the gold price retreated, and then it was changed to 875. Afterwards, although there was a lack of trading, the trend seemed to be hardening. A large number of sellers were willing to trade the American dollar for May delivery at 29.0625 yuan. No one inquired about the American dollar for July delivery at 4375. Then it hardened to 5625, which could be settled. Later, it was flat.

The closing bid for the near-term British exchange rate was 1 shilling and 8.25 pence, 0.125 pence harder than the previous close.

<h3>Grain: Downriver Rice Sales Stagnant, Prices Fall Several Cents</h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday's supply came from over 30 sources. City and rural retailers remained sluggish. Over 1,000 piculs were purchased. However, buyers were extremely demanding, causing the prices of rice from Su Tong merchants and Qing Jiao from Nan Gang to fall by several cents, up to a dime. Du Yang Jian and Yin Yuan rice remained scarce and fragrant, with asking prices slightly raised by a dime. The market for Bian Yuan rice was neither good nor bad. (Hu Bei) Yesterday's supply from downriver came from over 20 sources. White japonica rice sales were brisk, while high-quality ingredients were sluggish. Continued transactions occurred for lower-middle grade goods, and the market was firm for those grades, although the high grades were down a few cents. The market for thin japonica early rice was stable and active. Du Bu Ke Jian rice showed a stable trend, while Yin Yuan and Bian Yuan rice were fairly priced.</p>
<h3>Passenger Xian Rice: Another 5,000 Bags Arrive</h3>
<p>Fujian merchants take advantage of small prices to continue purchasing around 3,000 bags ▲</p>
<p>Yesterday's market for passenger xian rice saw prices drop slightly after the stagnation of the previous day. Fujian merchants took advantage of the small prices to continue purchasing, completing transactions for around 3,000 bags. The market then quickly stabilized. However, the arrival of Xiangyi passenger xian rice was substantial, with loaded and unloaded bags constantly arriving. Yesterday, two steamships from Jiang'an and Zhaoxing arrived at the port with over 5,000 bags. Sales were only 3,000 bags. More arrived than were sold, and the market took a downward turn. Fortunately, Fujian merchants still had strong appetite, and prices did not fall much. If sales pick up today and tomorrow, market prices may be able to stabilize. A total of 483 bags of Jiangxi late-season rice were sold at 8.29 silver dollars, 1,200 bags of Hunan machine-milled red rice were sold at 8.25 to 8.12 silver dollars, 1,000 bags of coarse red rice were sold at 7.55 silver dollars, and 152 bags of coarse oil rice were sold at 7.70 silver dollars. This firm sold 86 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled rice at 7 silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Newchwang Beans: First Batch Opens at 17 Carloads</h3>
<p>The first batch of Newchwang beans arrived three days ago and began selling yesterday with 17 carloads, purchased by factories at prices ranging from 3.87 to 3.883 taels. Market sentiment reflected a willingness to open at even prices on both the buying and selling sides due to fears of market instability. Inland cart houses purchased several hundred bags of Newchwang beans. In addition, one carload of Pei County beans was transacted at 3.73 taels. Wenzhou merchants showed continued strong appetite for green beans, purchasing 300 bags of Liuhe green beans at a price of 3.6 taels, with slightly mixed quality.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Falls Back</h3>
<p>A report from the Sincere Company states that Chicago wheat first rose on Tuesday (the 4th) due to a poor winter report, and then fell as bulls took profits. Total trading volume for the day was 50 million bushels. The market prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price  Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>May Future  55.375  Down 0.375</p>
<p>July Future  56.250  Down 0.125</p>
<p>September Future 57.000  Down 0.250</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Sugar Falls by a Small 2.5 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market weakened due to a decline in the benchmark price and unchanged Dutch exchange rates. The guild set the price for ordinary grade 24 coarse white sugar at 15 taels and 7.5 cents, down by a small 2.5 cents from the previous day. The price for standard grade 20 and 18 medium white sugar was set at 14 taels and 5 mace. The price for #8 and #9 Dutch red sugar remained unchanged, with few transactions. The Yuan Xing firm offered a batch of #8 Dutch red sugar futures for May and June delivery, totaling 200 tons, at a price of 1.775 currency yuan, excluding new regulations and taxes. Hainan red sugar arrived yesterday via Guangdong ship, but the total amount is unknown due to the presence of re-exported goods. Wufu White Ice Brand has opened slightly, with the price remaining at 12 taels per ingot. (Yesterday's report stated that dozens of bags of new cotton red sugar were offered, but the character "ten" was mistakenly printed as "thousand." This is hereby corrected.)</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Pessimism in European and American Silk Sales</h3>
<p>In the raw silk markets of New York, Lyon, and other places, factories continue to show little interest in purchasing spot and future goods. Silk prices continue to decline. Japanese silk is cheap, and Chinese and Italian silks are virtually unsalable. Silk telegrams are not being forwarded, and the Shanghai silk market is lifeless. Yesterday, only Xinfu purchased 10 bales of Sister Brand #13 and #15 yellow silk from the Jing Ten factory at a price of 495 taels. Xiangji purchased 15 bales of 3K Brand Mianyang coarse yellow silk at a price of 385 taels. There were no market reports available in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Rayon: Customer Sales Still Lacking Improvement</h3>
<p>580 Cases Arrived</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local rayon market continued to lack improvement in customer sales. Only merchants from Sichuan and Hubei purchased May and June futures, totaling 3-4 cases of Red Green Bell, Samsung, and Flying Eagle brands, at prices ranging from 128 taels 7 mace 5 candareens to 124 taels 2 mace 5 candareens net.</p>
<p>The Italian postal ship "Conte Rosso" imported 580 cases of rayon yesterday morning from various European and American countries. All are stored in Customs Warehouse No. 8.</p>
<h3>Moroccan Tea Market Reports Decline</h3>
<p>French Morocco is a very large market for Chinese tea. In recent years, the amount of various types of green tea, including Lu Zhuang, Tu Zhuang, and Ping Shui, imported to that port has increased from 200,000 chests to 330,000-340,000 chests. Since last year, when Japanese companies such as Mitsui and Mitsuyoshi shipped large quantities of Japanese tea to that port for sale, Chinese tea has suffered a significant blow. According to news from British merchants currently in Morocco, sales of Japanese tea have not seen significant improvement, but the Chinese tea market is also quieter than in the previous two months. Taking Zhen Mei tea as an example, sales have fallen from the usual 50-60 chests per month to only 30-40 chests. This is mainly due to poor harvests of agricultural products in the area, leading to economic hardship and a significant reduction in purchasing power among farmers. As a result, British and French tea merchants have had to lower prices to sell their existing stocks, resulting in an average drop of 25 francs per dan compared to the previous month, causing inevitable losses for merchants.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Asphalt Shows a Sharp Downward Trend</h3>
<p>Asphalt, which had been in demand due to the need for candles, saw some activity in the sales market. As inventory in various places was not high, and sales were slightly smooth, the market moved upwards. Asphalt from Hankou and Macheng was sold for 16 taels, and Chongjing asphalt also increased to 17 taels, creating a tense situation with a seemingly imminent increase of another tael. However, the demand for candle-making and summer torch-making typically targets high-quality products and is not substantial in volume, and the duration is short. Consequently, preparations are typically completed within half a month. Current observations indicate that only about one-tenth or one-fifth is still needed. Therefore, the market is showing a sharp downward trend. According to detailed letters from Hankou in recent days, Chongjing asphalt has fallen to 16 taels and 4 mace, and Macheng asphalt from previous shipments has fallen to 15 taels and 4 mace, and 15 taels and 2 mace for asphalt from previous shipments. Supplies are plentiful, and inventories are thick. Lower-quality asphalt originally relied on sales to soap factories. However, since beef tallow is now cheaper than asphalt, soap factories have switched to alternative sources, causing sales of softer asphalt to remain stagnant, far less active than high-quality asphalt. High-quality asphalt is, in turn, constrained by lower-quality asphalt and is also falling in price, making it impossible to stabilize. Local merchants did purchase a batch of asphalt, but have already sold most of it, so current inventories are not particularly high. However, with summer sales having passed seven or eight tenths, future sales will gradually become sporadic, so merchants are unwilling to stock up. Recent market activity has gradually become quiet, but with prices having already fallen this much, any further decline will be limited. In general, future conditions will be characterized by prolonged weakness and short-lived rallies. Although merchants have not changed their listed prices, they are secretly selling at lower prices, leading to inconsistent market prices. In general, price cuts will be necessary within the day.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Over 30 Cases of Spring and Summer Light Goods Offered</h3>
<p>918 Serge Dominates the Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the N绒公会 (Woolen Goods Guild) was very lively with transactions among members, with both retail and wholesale sales. Over 30 cases were offered at the guild in the morning and afternoon, and there were also many direct sales outside the guild. In the south city, in addition to Bao Da Xiang and Xie Da Xiang which had strong appetites, most transactions were for whole pieces. In the north city, only western tailoring shops made small purchases for material. The silk shops and clothing stores in the central district's Qipan Street and Daimalu/Shilu areas also had good appetite. Light goods for spring and summer sales saw numerous transactions. Products from the domestic Haijing and Zhanghua factories were also selling well. Herringbone wool, diced gabardine, flannel, suiting wool, and 918 serge were particularly dominant. It is reported that Zhanghua's retail department for 918 plain serge sold over 20 pieces yesterday.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Frequent Falls in Medium-Heavy Serge</h3>
<p>Affected by the Han Ling Peng Sheng Line</p>
<p>Medium-heavy serge is a popular product for spring and autumn sales, with Zhuang Qing being more widely sold than the Yuan color. Now is the peak season. Sale prices range from over 2 taels to 7-8 taels, with the most popular being Bao Ke Bao Duo, Dongfang 3008 and 3001, and Tianyou 1000 and 2000. Unexpectedly, the prices of these types of heavy serge have continued to fall since last week. Compared to ten days ago, current market prices have fallen by an average of several cents to over a mace per yard. The frequent price falls are largely due to the impact of Xinshengxing's Han Ling Peng production. Yesterday, Tianyou 1000 and 2000 were sold at a reduced price of 3 taels and 4 mace, and some were even secretly transacted at 3 taels 3 mace and 2.5 candareens. Dongfang 3008 is slightly firmer than Tianyou, but has also been reduced by 2.5 cents to 3 taels and 3.5 mace.</p>

<h3>Drummond's Radio Address: Still Hopeful Japan Will Reconsider</h3>
<p>The Strength of the League of Nations Weakened Slightly by Japan's Withdrawal</p>
<p>But the League is Growing Stronger in Spirit</p>
<p>(London) League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond stated in a wide-ranging radio address today that while the strength of the League of Nations has been slightly weakened by Japan's withdrawal, it is growing stronger in spirit by resolutely dealing with the most difficult situation it has ever faced. Had Japan obeyed the League of Nations Covenant earlier and presented its difficulties to the League, it would certainly have received a sympathetic hearing and obtained appropriate measures to fully guarantee its interests in Manchuria. Unfortunately, the policy adopted by Japan runs counter to the principles advocated by the League of Nations. It is hoped that Japan will reconsider its decision and agree to the Lytton Commission's proposal to maintain peace in the Far East, to be friendly to China rather than at war with China. Japan can make great contributions to the East. The League of Nations is always prepared to assist Japan within the scope of the Covenant, he said. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>German Deputy Prime Minister Will</h3>
<p>Meet with Mussolini</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 5th: Deputy Prime Minister Papen and Parliament.</p>
<p>Minister Mussolini will discuss disarmament issues and the Four-Power Pact.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 5th: Today's Fascist General.</p>
<p>Report stated that Prime Minister Mussolini's Four-Power Pact plan.</p>
<p>Reduction, because only this can create the necessary conditions for peace, and.</p>
<p>So on and so forth.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 5th: Today's cabinet meeting, chaired by the French President, endorsed the full text of the French aide-memoire on the Four-Power Pact, with particular emphasis on treaty revisions. US representative Davis met today with French Prime Minister Daladier and the French ambassador to Italy, Jouvenel. The main issues discussed were the Four-Power Pact and the economic conference. It is understood that international debt was not discussed. The French government's position on this matter is particularly complicated. Since December of last year, the Parliament's view on international debt has slightly tilted towards payment, but according to Washington news, President Roosevelt is particularly unwilling to grant any further extensions. This seems sufficient to cause France to firmly refuse to continue paying war debts, waiting for Germany to continue paying reparations, and then repaying war debts again.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 5th: The State Council met at the Presidential Palace today. Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour explained France's memorandum on the Anglo-Italian Four-Power Pact proposal, and the main part of it was endorsed by the State Council.

<h3>"Germans Are Going Backwards"</h3>
<p>Conflict Between the German Government and the Foreign Correspondents' Association</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 5th: The German government is now in serious conflict with the Foreign Press Association in Berlin. This association represents approximately 135 foreign correspondents from more than twenty countries. The conflict arose because the association's president and Chicago Daily News correspondent, Morrell, published his book, "Germans Are Going Backwards." The German government believes that the book is reactionary and has decided to boycott the association until Morrell is removed from the presidency. Today, the association received a notice stating that the German government would not attend any gatherings of the association, as a sign of boycott. At the same time, Morrell submitted his resignation, but today the association held a general meeting and voted 60 to 7 not to allow Morrell to resign, and declared that it was willing to quietly await any measures decided upon by the German government.</p>
<h3>Japan Attaches Importance to Sino-Japanese Customs Agreement</h3>
<p>Domei, Tokyo, 6th: The Emperor of Japan received Chinese Ambassador Ariyoshi Akira at 2:00 PM today to hear about the latest situation in China.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 6th: The current Sino-Japanese reciprocal tariff agreement will expire on May 15th of this year. What attitude China will adopt afterward has a significant impact on trade with China. Mr. Funatsu, Director of the United Textile Association in China, who returned to Tokyo from Shanghai last year, visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to report on the latest situation in China and hoped that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would properly handle the tariff issue. Various private sectors are also paying close attention to this issue. The Japan-China Business Association has scheduled a meeting of its directors on the 7th at its Marunouchi office to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>Hualian, Tokyo, April 6th: The Sino-Japanese tariff treaty will expire on May 15th. The period after June is the peak season for Japanese trade exports, and traders with China are very uneasy. It is reported that the Osaka Chamber of Commerce for trading merchants dispatched representatives to Tokyo yesterday to visit Foreign Minister Uchida and request the government to find a way to continue the treaty, otherwise the future of trade with China will be even more unimaginable. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also very concerned about this case. It is reported that the representatives present advised the government not to continue its military policy.</p>
<h3>British Parliament Discusses Boycotting Russian Goods</h3>
<p>Simon Chen Explains the Reasons</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th - Foreign Secretary Simon Chen explained in the House of Commons tonight the government's reasons for proposing a ban on imports from Russia. The public paid close attention to his remarks. Chen stated that the existing trade agreement between Britain and Russia would expire on April 17th. If external events should affect the mutually acceptable and reasonable measures, the British government would consider it regrettable. However, at a time when negotiations for a new trade agreement are underway, a most disturbing incident occurred: six British technicians from the Vickers Electrical Company were arrested by the Soviet Russian authorities on trumped-up charges. We certainly do not deny any foreign government's right to proper prosecution, but we cannot forget that the Soviet Russian political detective department shot thirty-five Russians it had arrested without trial. If all documents were to be made public now, it might not benefit the defendants. In short, apart from raising this case, he knows of no other way to secure a fair trial for the defendants. The British authorities are extremely concerned about the defendants and feel unable to continue negotiations for a new trade agreement. The British government has now heard that the trial of the six technicians is scheduled to begin around April 10th. The Labour Party strongly opposes this government policy. Former Labour government Attorney General Sir Clip said that Britons in Russia had not been subjected to unfair, improper, or unusual treatment. Ordinary people under the jurisdiction of the Russian courts would not suffer such treatment. The actions of the British government will not only harm relations between the two countries but also jeopardize the fate of Britons in Soviet Russian hands. Minister of Commerce Rensiman replied that he considered with sympathy the proposal of Labour leader Lansbury to limit the date of implementation to handle the arrest of Britons and not the entire issue of British-Russian trade. The House of Commons, by a vote of 47 against 48, rejected the Labour Party's motion to drop the proposal. Thus, the import restriction bill passed its second reading. About twenty members of the Liberal Party, including Samuel, did not vote.</p>
<h3>Germany and the Jews</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 5th - At Leventonstdan, violence occurred today. Four Jews were abducted by nine armed men into a car, intending to force them back into German territory. Among the four Jews were the Roths, who jumped out of the car in Tirol, trying to escape. As a result, all perished. The other two Jews were also injured. Roth was the manager of a famous theater in Berlin. He fled to Liechtenstein two years ago due to embezzlement. At the same time, in Tirol, German journalist Dr. Pehl was murdered in a hotel. Pehl was originally a member of the National Socialist Party. The murderers were apparently members of the Bavarian National Socialist Party, who accused Pehl of betraying the party and killed him in retaliation.</p>
<h3>Einstein Receives Threatening Letters</h3>
<p>Havas, Capital City of Belgium, 5th - According to evening newspapers, Professor Einstein is in dire straits after German authorities confiscated his property. The professor has also received many anonymous threatening letters.</p>
<h3>Aircraft and Warships Search for Bodies</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 5th - The seventy-one officers and men lost from the Akron airship are now considered to have no hope of survival. Yesterday, a warship found the body of Major McClelland. The authorities immediately ordered a search southward near the coast. So far, only McClelland's body has been recovered. When the warship passed by, only his head was visible, his arms outstretched as if tightly holding a piece of wood. Although the ships searched extensively around the site of the Akron's accident, only wreckage from the Akron floated on the sea. Yesterday, several naval and army aircraft joined the search, but to no avail. The small airship J-3 also crashed and sank yesterday. A destroyer rescued five people, but three are still missing. The three survivors of the Akron have gradually recovered. Major Villers still suspects that the Akron crashed due to an electric shock, but he also said that it might have been an electric shock that went unnoticed. Meteorologists believe that the direct current in the air must have caused the ship to descend, making it impossible for the pilot to control.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 5th - Congress is now planning to investigate the true cause of the Akron's accident. Some members of Congress are now advocating for the suspension of the construction of naval airships. According to naval officials, President Roosevelt's grand plan to find work for the unemployed includes the construction of thirty new warships.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 5th - A newspaper of the National Sovereignty Party reported that during the Easter period, Goering, Prussian Minister of the Interior and an important member of the National Socialist Party in the Federal Senate, will visit Rome to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. His mission will focus particularly on aviation issues. Federal Deputy Prime Minister Papen will also travel to Rome to meet with the Pope and discuss the relationship between the German Catholic Party and the German National Sovereignty Party.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Washington, 5th - President Roosevelt recently issued a declaration stating that British Prime Minister MacDonald will visit the United States in the latter half of April. Following recent informal talks between Britain and the United States, Roosevelt deeply felt that MacDonald's visit to the United States was timely. It is appropriate during the Easter holiday. MacDonald will stay in the United States for approximately three days, from April 18th to 21st. Whether the talks will be limited to Britain and the United States or expanded to include other countries such as France is currently unknown. However, President Roosevelt is willing to discuss major national issues such as disarmament and the World Economic Conference with representatives of major countries. This is beyond doubt.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Public Works Bureau Plans to Establish a Gas Plant</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Director of the Public Works Bureau announced that the establishment of a large gas plant is currently under consideration. The authorities believe that this move is urgently needed because Guangzhou is constantly suffering from a shortage of fuel. Recently, due to resistance to Japanese coal, coal prices have risen sharply. The people of Guangzhou now rely entirely on firewood as their only fuel. Guangzhou currently has more than one million residents. Only a large-scale gas plant can solve the people's daily fuel needs.</p>

<p>(Harbin) A Chinese business firm in Fuchiatien was recently robbed, losing 60,000 yuan. The six bandits were unusually calm and brave, which is rare. When they left, they made phone calls to summon two cars and left leisurely. The bandits were all Chinese, each carrying firearms. They seemed very familiar with the contents of the business firm. The robbery occurred just after the six armed guards at the gate had taken a break. The guards put down their guns and started washing. The bandits suddenly rushed in, snatched their guns, and drove them into the basement. About forty employees in the firm were also driven into a room. The bandits threatened to shoot anyone who dared to shout. The bandits then searched everywhere in the building, found the keys, opened the iron safe, and seized everything inside. Finally, they called a car company and summoned two cars. The bandits smoked cigarettes, looking very relaxed. After getting into the cars and driving into Harbin, they paid the fare and left. Afterwards, the drivers told people that they only learned about the robbery after returning to Fuchiatien, but at the time, they did not know that they were carrying wealthy robbers.

<h3>Oil Mines</h3>
<p>China's only oil mine is in Jiufo Tang, Jehol, which is 20 li north of Gongyingzi and 75 li south of Lingyuan County. The mine area is located in a valley, with an area of 15 li from north to south and 10 li from east to west. According to previous surveys by American technicians, its reserves are extremely rich and difficult to estimate. The best thing about this oil mine is that the crude oil flows freely from the rocks, so residents nearby often take it for fuel. Since being occupied by the Japanese army, this place has been sealed off, and the Japanese are sending technicians to study the exploitation.</p>
<h3>Other Mineral Products</h3>
<p>Other mineral products, such as iron, copper, asbestos, and sulfur, are also very rich in various counties of Jehol Province. According to Japanese investigations, they are as follows:</p>
<p>Steel: Yingwochuan (Chengde), Jiulongshan (Fengning), Tongdonggou, Qiandong Yanzi Gou, Sidonggou (Pingquan),</p>
<p>Iron: Songshugou (Chengde),</p>
<p>Asbestos: Pindingshan, Majiazi Xishan, (Chaoyang), Jinjiazhangzi (Jianping), Qingshiling, Kuangdongshan (Lingyuan),</p>
<p>Saltpeter: Heishui, Gushan (Jianping)</p>
<p>Sulfur: Dawopu (Pingquan)</p>
<p>Silica: Kuwoshan (Jianping)</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun on the 28th, in order to increase the wealth of the "Japan-Manchu" countries, it is actively working on gold prospecting. Since the summer of last year, the Geological Survey has sent Mr. Yabe Shigeru to Alaska and gold-producing areas in the United States to study the latest gold mining methods and drilling machines. After returning to China, the Survey immediately established a gold mining class to prepare everything. The Economic Survey also established a survey department. Currently, it is recruiting volunteers from demobilized soldiers and is providing practical guidance at the gold mining field in Chaihebao near Tieling from January onwards. Now that the ice melting season has arrived, it has been decided to dispatch the first survey team to prospect for gold in the Wutong River area, a tributary of the lower Songhua River. Mantetsu has also increased funding to 500,000 yuan. The survey team is scheduled to gather in Harbin in early April and depart together with a security force of 300 people. It is expected that the upper reaches of the Wutong River, which is one of the gold-producing areas in Heilongjiang, is the first planned site. The placer gold area in the Heihe area is the second planned site. If the results are good, it will start large-scale gold prospecting this year. It is said that 50 years ago, the Russians discovered placer gold in northern Manchuria, but were prevented from illegally mining it by Li Hongzhang. The gold-producing areas are roughly divided into (1) the right bank of the Ergun River, (2) the Heilongjiang bank, (3) the Songhua River bank, and (4) the Nenjiang River basin. Its reserves reach 1.5 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Japan's Local Finances Fall Deeper into Poverty</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun said that the Ministry of the Interior previously convened a national prefectural and county meeting to report on the content of local budgets. The survey was completed on March 28. The total amount of the ordinary accounting budget was 494.495 million yuan, an increase of 64.444 million yuan compared with the initial budget for the seventh year and an increase of 65.5 million yuan compared with the sixth year. However, in terms of revenue, it decreased by 4.7 million yuan compared with the seventh year and 18.93 million yuan compared with the sixth year. Due to the economic downturn, revenue has decreased year by year and expenditures have increased year by year. In addition, the rural areas have declined and the economic situation is unstable. Local finances are falling deeper into a severe panic.</p>
<h3>Japan Says the Target of the US Arms Embargo is Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun, April 1 - The US arms embargo bill passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 29th. However, the attitude of the Senate will be decisive. The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is dominated by Democrats, so there is no opposition. What is most noteworthy in this case is that although the applicable target is the conflict in South America, the result is undoubtedly of particular concern to Japan among China and Japan. Therefore, our authorities (Japan) are paying very close attention to its changes. Because the United States has always regarded Japan as an aggressor, this case contains a significant political meaning. How Roosevelt will use it in the future is something the whole world is watching.</p>
<h3>Japan Establishes More Naval Agencies</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun said that due to the implementation of the Ministry of the Navy's budget for the next fiscal year, starting from April 1, it will implement the expansion of personnel and equipment in all aspects of its affiliates, namely (1) the Ship Administration Headquarters had reduced the seven-department system of the Main Division (Artillery) and the Second Division (Mines) to a six-department system. Now, in view of the importance of artillery and mines, the old system has been restored, (2) the General Affairs Department of the Aviation Headquarters has been expanded by setting up two new sections, (3) the technicians, clerks, and technicians of the Yokosuka, Kure, Sasebo Naval Factories, and Maizuru Naval Port Aviation Factory Construction Bureau have been increased, and affairs have been expanded, and (4) the three-shift system of the General Staff Headquarters has been changed to a four-shift system, with the establishment of an intelligence shift to manage communications.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun on the Relationship Between US-Russia Rapprochement and Japan</h3>
<p>Vigorously Attacks the Soviet Union, Saying Its Internal Affairs are Unstable</p>
<p>Japan Has Nothing to Fear Even if the US and Russia Become Close</p>
<p>Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun, March 28 - US President Roosevelt has made the recognition of the Soviet Union an unavoidable fact. However, what is the purpose of the US-Russia rapprochement? We must discuss this in conjunction with the rapprochement between China and Russia. Originally, after the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the one directly threatened was Japan. Now Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations and its diplomacy is isolated. There are many powerful enemies in the international community who are eyeing it covetously. For example, the cooperation between Britain and the United States for China is actually to deal with Japan in the Far East, and the cooperation between Britain and France in Europe has also become a special force. Now that the US and Russia are approaching each other, the US is pressing Japan with its navy and Russia is resisting Japan with its army. There is no doubt that Japan will be threatened by the navies and armies of both countries at the same time. However, is the Russian army really to be feared? This is what we must urgently investigate. The Soviet Union's five-year plan focuses on heavy industry, with iron production as its top priority. Russia is using this to strengthen its military and vigorously implement communist politics, which it cannot help but do. Today, Russia has a standing army of millions, and it boasts that it can mobilize a total of 12 million once an emergency occurs. The number of aircraft in its arsenal is more than ten times that of Japan. However, according to a certain foreigner who is recently engaged in the Soviet Russian military industry, Soviet Russian military expansion is actually exposing its weaknesses. Why? The Soviet Russian plan to expand its military is actually because the foundation of its communist politics is not solid. Recently, riots have occurred in Siberia, and there has been an attack on Stalin's residence in Moscow. The Soviet Russian authorities are deeply aware of this and have to expand their military to stabilize the position of the government. Moreover, whether this kind of military force can be relied upon is also doubtful to us. If it is defeated in a war with Japan, I am afraid that all dissatisfied elements in the country will rise up in rebellion, and communist politics will inevitably collapse. Therefore, although the Russian army is extremely large, it is not to be feared. Japan has nothing to worry about even if the US and Russia become close. However, what is to be feared is that if an incident occurs in North China due to the rapprochement between the two countries, various disputes will arise from then on.</p>
<h3>After the Mukden Incident, Many People in the Northeast Rose Up in Rebellion</h3>
<p>To Prevent the Collapse of Mount Bai, Heads Must Be Thrown</p>
<p>To Seek the Long Flow of the Black Water, Iron Blood Must Be Poured</p>
<p>Having Experienced Hundreds of Battles, Large and Small</p>
<p>Now Lurking in the Wilderness, Crying for Relief</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association in our city received a telegram from Yang Zhibin and other Northeast volunteer people yesterday, saying that it has been 17 months since the Japanese bandits occupied the Northeast. In these 17 months, the Japanese slaves have been implementing their gradual annexation plan every day in order to achieve their purpose of swallowing up territory. They have occupied our land and massacred our people. Everyone is filled with hatred and resentment. All those with blood and qi cannot help but stand on end. Zhibin, Yongzi, and others were motivated by the responsibility of every commoner to gather volunteers and rise up to kill the enemy. They respectfully present the process of resisting Japan and make a weeping report to the people of the country. Zhibin, Yongzi, Zhao Zaiyin and others have a total of more than 30,000 people. In May and June of last year, they attacked Fangzheng County and defeated the forces of the rebel army Yu Shengzeng, Li Wenbing, and Liu Yushu in Tongzigou. They also defeated the Japanese army at Hongtuya, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers, and sank two Japanese warships on the Songhua River. In July and August, they captured Kehe City. The rebel army Chen Decai's brigade was defeated and dispersed, killing more than 300 Japanese soldiers. In September and October, they attacked Shuangcheng and fought fiercely for three days and three nights, and finally recovered it, and reorganized the rebel army Zhang Yingjie's unit of more than 1,500 people, killing more than 50 Japanese soldiers. In November, they sent a team to blow up the Songhua River Bridge on the Harbin-Changchun line. More than 20 Japanese military vehicles fell into the water. The Harbin-Changchun Road was blocked for more than ten days. This is a brief overview of Zhibin, Yongzi, and others' resistance against Japan. (Omitted) The comrades have been exposed to the wind and rain, sleeping in the snow and eating frost, rushing through the hail of bullets, lurking in the wilderness, not knowing the taste of salt for four days, and the various hardships are indescribable. Alas, to prevent the collapse of Mount Bai, heads must be thrown. To seek the long flow of the Black Water, iron blood must be poured. Han Guang and others have pledged themselves to the country and have no regrets. As long as there is a breath left, they will definitely fight the Japanese to the end. We only hope that the people of the country will extend a helping hand and generously contribute to the cause. One bullet is enough to kill an enemy, and one dou of millet is enough to support a soldier. We must ensure that patriotic men can continue their work so that there is hope of recovering lost territory. Weeping and pleading, we hope you will take note. Song Yongzi, Zhao Zaiyin, Wang Hanguang, Hou Laozhen, Wang Caichen, Liu Guodong, Yang Zhibin, Rui Daoyi of the Northeast People's Volunteer Army.</p>

<h3>Bank Meeting</h3>
<p>After receiving the telegram from the Ministry of Finance, the Bankers Association, in addition to convening a members' meeting that evening to decide on three measures, convened another members' meeting at 11:00 AM today on the fourth floor of the association at No. 4 Hong Kong Road to discuss settlement methods with fellow members and foreign banks. The meeting was chaired by Li Fusun and did not adjourn until 12:00 noon.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Declares He Will Not Assume Presidency of the Bank of China</h3>
<p>Minister Song Urges Him to Accept in Shanghai</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, due to his busy schedule, found it difficult to concurrently hold the position of President of the Central Bank and submitted a request to the Central Government to resign, which was approved by the Central Political Council, appointing Kong Xiangxi as his successor. This morning, Kong declared that he felt unequal to the important and complex duties of the Bank of China and expressed his refusal to accept the post. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Mr. Song Urges</h3>
<p>Minister of Finance Song Ziwen arrived in Shanghai this morning around 8:00 AM by train from Nanjing. After disembarking at Zhenru, he returned to his private residence on Qiqi Road to rest. Around 11:00 AM, he drove to visit Kong Xiangxi on West Asmus Road, urging him to succeed him as President of the Central Bank, stating that he himself was unable to concurrently manage the position due to his many affairs. However, Kong humbly declined, stating that he was not competent. The conversation lasted until around 12:00 PM before he departed.</p>
<h3>Mr. Kong's Statement</h3>
<p>After meeting with Minister Song, Kong told a Central News Agency reporter, "Minister Song has resigned from the position of President of the Central Bank due to his busy schedule, and the Central Political Council has decided to appoint me as his successor. However, I have not yet received a formal order, so I cannot yet express whether I will accept the position. Even if the Central Government formally appoints me as the President of the bank, I am determined to refuse. The Central Bank is a national bank with a grand scale, and only those with the knowledge and experience of Minister Song can be competent. I have shallow knowledge and lack experience in managing banks. I truly feel incompetent to manage such a major national financial institution. When I was the Minister of Industry, I established the National Products Bank, but the National Products Bank was smaller in scale and easier to manage, which is different from the Central Bank. Some may say that in this time of national crisis and economic depression, all Chinese people should share the burden. But it is important to know that those who are skilled in industry are not good at farming, and those who are farmers are not good at trading. If I were to force myself into the position, it would be impossible. Therefore, I am expressing my refusal to accept the position."</p>
<h3>History of the Central Bank</h3>
<p>Since the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai in the spring of the 16th year of the Republic (1927), the authorities of the National Government, recognizing the national bank as the leader of financial institutions, immediately ordered preparations for the Central Bank, using the former site of the Sino-Russian Daosheng Bank in Shanghai as its base. The first governor was Zhou Peizhen, followed by Wang Wenbai, and then Chen Jian'an. All were during the preparatory period and before the opening. In the autumn of the 17th year (1928), Minister of Finance Song Ziwen deemed it necessary to open the Central Bank and established a preparatory office at the original site, with the aim of opening for business in the shortest possible time. He then submitted the Central Bank Regulations to the National Government, which were passed on October 5th and promulgated on the same day. It was also decided to allocate 20 million yuan from the short-term financial public bonds as capital. During the National Government meeting, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen proposed that Song Ziwen, Chen Jian'an, Ye Zhuotang, Yao Yongbai, Wang Baolun, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Guangfu, Rong Zongjing, and Zhou Zongliang be appointed as directors. Song Ziwen, Chen Jian'an, Ye Zhuotang, Yao Yongbai, and Wang Baolun were designated as managing directors, and Song Ziwen was specially appointed as the president. Chen Jian'an was appointed as the deputy president. Li Fusun, Bei Songsheng, Qin Runqing, Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Xu Jiyu, were appointed as supervisors, and the Audit Council also appointed Wang Yihou as a supervisor. The supervisory board elected Li Fusun as chairman. Bei Songsheng, Qin Runqing, and Xu Jiyu each served a term of one year. It opened on November 1st of that year, with Gu Yigu as the general manager of the business bureau, Zhou Dexin as the deputy general manager, Li Zhilian as the chief of issuance of the issuance bureau, Xi Demao as the deputy chief of issuance, and Zhu Puquan as the chief auditor. In October of the 18th year (1929), Yao Yongbai resigned as managing director and Zheng Lai succeeded him. In January of the 20th year (1931), Gu Yigu, the general manager of the business bureau, and Zhou Dexin, the deputy general manager, resigned successively. Zheng Lai resigned as managing director, and Tang Shoumin was appointed as managing director and general manager of the business bureau. Zhou Zongliang and Zhang Peishen were appointed as deputy general managers. On January 6th of the 21st year (1932), the government was reorganized, and Song Ziwen resigned from all his concurrently held positions.</p>
<p>Huang Hanliang was appointed Minister of Finance. Because the government based its decision on the Shanghai Peace Conference resolution, it implemented the independence of the Central Bank and separated it from political trends. Also, because the terms of the previous directors and supervisors had expired, Xu Jiyu, Ye Zhuotang, Chen Guangfu, Wu Daquan, Xia Peng, Zhang Gongquan, Qian Xinzhi, Rong Guangfu, Wu Daquan, and Xia Peng were appointed as managing directors, and Xu Jiyu was specially appointed as deputy president, acting as president. Li Fusun, Yu Qiaqing, Bei Songsheng, Wang Yihou, Qin Runqing, Hu Mengjia, and Tang Shoumin were appointed as supervisors, and Li Fusun was elected as chairman. Subsequently, Tang Shoumin, the general manager of the business bureau, Li Zhilian, the chief of issuance of the issuance bureau, and Chen Qinghua, the chief secretary, resigned. Zhu Puquan was appointed as the general manager of the business bureau, Zhou Zongliang and Zhang Peishen remained as deputy general managers, Wang Baolun was appointed as the chief of issuance of the issuance bureau, Lin Tianji and Yang Bo were appointed as deputy chiefs of issuance, Lu Wangxian was appointed as the chief auditor, and Zeng Rongpu was appointed as the chief secretary. Chen Qinghua became an auditor of the supervisory board. On February 5th, Song Ziwen, the Minister of Finance and President, resumed his duties, and at the same time, Xu Jiyu, the acting president, and all directors and supervisors were dismissed. All former directors, supervisors, deputy presidents, general managers, chiefs of issuance, and chief secretaries were ordered to resume their positions. In August of that year, the Customs Gold Exchange Department was renamed the Exchange Bureau, with Xi Demao as the general manager. The bank issued exchange vouchers, which were inspected by the supervisory board every ten days and published in the newspaper. From the official opening of the bank until the end of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the accumulated profit totaled 80,169,120.86 yuan.</p>
<h3>Zhao Zhuohua Talks About the Solid Defense of Dolon</h3>
<p>The Enemy's Strength is Weak</p>
<p>Rumors of Loss are Inaccurate</p>
<p>Recently, alarming news about the tension in Dolon has been frequently reported. Some say that Dolon has already been lost, and others say that the troops stationed in Dolon have all withdrawn from the city. According to Zhao Zhuohua, the representative of Feng Zhanhai stationed in Shanghai, the defense of Dolon is solid. Sun Dianying's troops are stationed in the south of Dolon, Feng Zhanhai's troops are stationed in the north of Dolon, and the commander of the □□□th Army, □□□, is stationed in Dolon. The enemy attacking Dolon is only 7,000 to 8,000 people, mostly composed of puppet troops and Mongolian bandits. These mobs have weak strength and cannot occupy Dolon. Therefore, the rumor of Dolon's loss is absolutely inaccurate. However, the current situation in Dolon is indeed very tense. The enemy's plan is to invade North China from the Shanhaiguan area and Shanxi from the Dolon area. Dolon is a place that the enemy is determined to obtain in their plan. It is hoped that the people of the country will pay close attention to it.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen's Reasons for Resigning as President of the Bank of China</h3>
<p>The Government is Determined Not to Compromise with Japan</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that those responsible for military affairs are unwilling to expand military operations against Japan, so Mr. Song has expressed a passive attitude and a desire to retire. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency paid a special visit to Mr. Song at 10:00 AM to inquire about the truth. Mr. Song replied that there was absolutely no such thing. The origin of this rumor should be attributed to my resignation as President of the Central Bank. In fact, my resignation as President of the Central Bank is precisely for active responsibility. There are three reasons: When the Central Bank was first established, due to the initial organization and unstable foundation, it was necessary for the Minister of Finance to concurrently serve as president. Over the years, it has experienced major and dangerous environments such as internal strife, floods, foreign aggression, and the decline in silver prices, but the Central Bank has not been affected in the slightest. Now the foundation is very solid, and business has developed to the point where it is no longer necessary for me to concurrently serve as president. This is the first reason. Moreover, as the Minister of Finance, my responsibility is to maintain and regulate the national finance and economy as a whole. Serving concurrently as the president of the Central Bank may lead to a biased focus on one bank and neglect the overall situation, which is very inconvenient. This is the second reason. Today, the most important thing in finance is to plan for wartime military expenditures, but we cannot neglect economic construction. The economy is the foundation of the country. Our country's current situation is extremely immature and backward. If we do not catch up quickly and only focus on temporary solutions, there will inevitably be a day of exhaustion. I intend to devote myself to this in the future, but the organization of the Central Bank is becoming increasingly complex, and it is difficult to handle both concurrently. This is the third reason. Based on these three reasons, after I resigned as President of the Central Bank, President Wang recommended former Minister Kong to succeed me. The supervisors of the Central Bank have not changed, and all policies remain the same. In the future, the Ministry of Finance will of course fulfill its full responsibility to maintain the Central Bank and achieve the effect of mutual cooperation. With someone specifically in charge, it will be able to develop even more. As for Chairman Chiang's trip to Nanchang, it was because the communist bandits in Jiangxi Province were rampant that he had to go there in person. It was definitely not to relax the war in North China. The rumor that someone advocated compromise is purely speculation. I reiterate to clarify that no one in the central government is willing to be Li Hongzhang. I am unwilling to express my views on other political issues because I have resigned from my position in the Executive Yuan. According to customs news, there is fighting five miles north of Qinhuangdao in the North China war.</p>
<h3>Both Parties Agree on the Cross-Border Telephone Contract</h3>
<p>Signing Will Commence After the Completion of Verification Procedures</p>
<p>The cross-border road construction telephone contract will be signed soon. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency stationed in Beijing visited Yan Renxian, the director of the Telecommunications Administration, yesterday. According to him, the signing procedures are still being negotiated. The Shanghai side has not yet telegraphed when the two parties will formally sign the contract. However, both parties have agreed on the contents of the contract. It is expected that the signing will commence after the completion of verification and other procedures. A time will then be set to officially announce the full text of the contract.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Replies to Municipal Government to Cancel Land Enclosure and Stop Trading Order</h3>
<p>A New Announcement of Acquisition Will be Made in the Future</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways previously planned to rebuild the joint passenger and freight terminal and temporary station on two railways, and planned to enclose civilian land in the Zhenru, Pengpu, and Jiangwan districts. Later, due to the urgent national crisis, the Ministry decided to postpone the project. The Shanghai Municipal Government inquired with the Ministry of Railways the other day whether the prohibition on buying and selling of civilian land previously enclosed should continue. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency stationed in Beijing inquired yesterday that the Ministry of Railways had replied to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, stating that since the construction project has been suspended, all the previously announced areas to be acquired are currently not needed. The order to stop buying and selling can be announced and cancelled first. When the issue of moving the station continues in the future, a new announcement of acquisition will be made.</p>
<h3>Postal News</h3>
<p>Price Reduction for News and Magazine Airmail to be Announced in the Next Few Days</p>
<p>Postal Delivery to Linyu and Qindao Not Affected by War</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has decided that the price reduction for airmail for news and magazines will take effect on April 16th. According to Director Huang of the Postal Administration this morning, the measure is entirely the government's good intention to support the news industry. However, the Ministry of Communications has not yet issued detailed regulations to the Postal Administration, so the announcement will be made in two or three days. Although the fighting in the Shimenzhai area is fierce, postal delivery to Linyu and Qindao is still unobstructed. Furthermore, the relocation of the General Postal Administration to Nanjing still requires time for deployment, so the relocation to Nanjing is still pending.</p>
<h3>The Third Batch of Antiquities Will Soon be Unloaded</h3>
<p>The third batch of antiquities from the Palace Museum, along with the antiquities from the Summer Palace and the Antiquities Exhibition Hall, totaling 3,922 boxes, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangtian Wheel. They were immediately unloaded and transported to the former site of the Renji Hospital on Tianzhutang Street for storage. As of 6:00 PM last night, 1,637 boxes had been unloaded. Unloading continued at 7:00 AM this morning, and by noon, 1,318 boxes had been unloaded, bringing the total to 2,955 boxes, including the 1,637 boxes unloaded last night. The remaining 967 boxes are expected to be completely unloaded by 5:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Convict Yan Jinbiao Executed by Hanging This Morning</h3>
<p>The Case of a Robber Shooting His Accomplices in a Hotel</p>
<p>At around 6:00 PM on August 15th, 1931, a case of robbers fighting each other over the division of spoils occurred in Room 2 of the Fashang Hotel on Xixinqiao Street in the French Concession. Four robbers in the room were shot on the spot, resulting in three deaths and one serious injury. The perpetrators then fled. The next day, the French police arrested the perpetrator Yan Jinbiao, a native of Jiangbei. He confessed to several robberies in the French Concession and admitted to shooting his accomplices in the Fashang Hotel. He was sentenced to death by the judge. The robber appealed, but after more than a year, the original sentence was upheld and was to be executed. At around 10:00 AM this morning, Guo Dezhang, the judge of the Second Special District Court, led several bailiffs and escorted him by car to the Caohejing execution ground for execution by hanging.</p>
<h3>Leader of the Korean Independence Party, Li Chunshan, Has Not Been Released</h3>
<p>Still Detained in the Hongkou Area</p>
<p>Since the arrest of Li Chunshan, the leader of the Korean Independence Party, it has become clear that there are political forces behind him. Yesterday's newspaper translated and published that Mr. Li had been escorted to Korea. However, a reporter from the Datong News Agency learned that Mr. Li is still being detained in a certain place in Hongkou and has not left Shanghai. Furthermore, the Japanese Consulate General also denied the statement.</p>
<h3>Students from the Engineering College of Peking University Visit Shanghai</h3>
<p>More than 20 students from the Engineering College of National Beiyang University, led by Dean of Academic Affairs Wang Jixu, came to Shanghai yesterday during their spring break. They plan to visit various factories and immediately went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to ask for introductions. It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to the Jiangnan Shipyard, the Naval Aircraft Factory, the Zhanghua Woolen Mill, the Continental Iron Factory, the Taifeng Biscuit Factory, the Kangyuan Canning Factory, the Shanghai Cement Company, the Nanyang Huacheng Tobacco Company, and the North and South Shanghai Water and Electricity Companies to provide proper hospitality.</p>
<h3>Drugstores Selling Abortifacient Drugs Raided</h3>
<p>Many Obscene Books and Pictures Seized</p>
<p>Drugs Sent to Chemists for Testing</p>
<p>Previously, the Shanghai small newspapers published abortion advertisements for various drugstores. The Municipal Education Bureau considered this to be related to public morals and requested the Public Concession Police to investigate. The police prosecuted the newspapers separately to the First Special Court, which sentenced them to fines. Now, the police believe that although the newspapers are guilty of violating the law by publishing these advertisements, the drugstores that published the advertisements are even more culpable. The police then filed a complaint with the First Special Court, requesting that search warrants be issued for the drugstores. Yesterday afternoon, Chen Yonggui, a Chinese detective from the Old Zha Police Station, along with detectives Li Shugui, Wang Jiaju, Wan Yuke, and others, raided the Tongshengtang Drugstore at No. 703 Niuwangzhuang Road, seizing several abortion drugs and account books and documents, along with the person in charge, Sun Wenhe, a native of Tianjin, and Ma Ruheng, and took them to the police station. They then went to the Tiande Drugstore at No. 246 Hankou Road, where they also seized similar drugs and other items, along with Yang Jinquan, a native of Tianjin. Jiangyin, who has a clinic at No. 109 Daqing Lane on Nanjing Road and also uses the alias Ma Chun, also has a clinic at No. 94 Pingle Lane on Xizang Road, specializing in performing abortions. They also raided these two locations, but Huang had gone to Suzhou to sweep the tombs and was not arrested. Only his assistant, Yu Jingshan, a native of Changzhou, was arrested. Many abortion drug books and obscene books and pictures were seized. This morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Ru Baoyi, the police lawyer, explained the circumstances of the arrest and stated that the defendants are now being prosecuted under Articles 306 and 308 of the Criminal Law. However, because the police still need to send the seized drugs for testing, they requested permission to postpone the hearing for one week. Judge Feng Shide approved the postponement of the case for one week for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Matsuoka Lavishly Praises the United States</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Diplomatic art is truly like a kaleidoscope. With a shake, it changes, constantly innovating and surprising, making it difficult not to be dazzled. However, if you use logical methods to summarize it, the so-called diplomatic art is very similar to the art of living. In short, it is nothing more than "boasting" and "flattery." If you don't believe me, please take a look at the true skills of Yosuke Matsuoka, the Japanese representative to the League of Nations, in recently lobbying the United States.</p>
<p>Saying things like, "Japan currently has no territory or fortresses within the American oceans, and Japan has never been a threat to American interests," this is the first style of Matsuoka's flattery and boasting. It's as if he is obediently and respectfully standing at attention before the American beauty. Subsequently, not hesitating to damage the dignity of the "Empire" and "Imperial Army" that he constantly praises, he further displays his obsequious attitude, offering a high hat to the American beauty, willingly bowing down, saying, "Japan is not yet qualified to fight against the wealthiest and safest country in the world," this is the second style of Matsuoka's flattery and boasting. It's as if he is taking out the inherent etiquette characteristics of the Oriental, frequently performing a 90-degree bow to the American beauty!</p>
<p>Finally, he even secretly winks, exposing his chest and arms, tempting and flirting with the American beauty, saying things like, "Most of the people in China are poor, how can they buy huge amounts of American goods? Japan buys more American goods than any other place in the Far East," the meaning is sweet. If it were not for a rustic man, few would not be soul-stirred! This is the third style of Matsuoka's flattery and boasting. However, I do not know what special etiquette of the Oriental he represents. However, I feel that Matsuoka's third style is very similar to the tone of "My meat is better than his." However, he has transformed it and applied it to the art of diplomacy. The imitation of the Orientals is not only admired by the Westerners, but also by me. I admire it to the highest degree of prostration!</p>
<p>Although, the facts are not only "most eloquent," but also the most adept at messing with those who habitually tell lies. No matter how eloquent Matsuoka's three-inch tongue is, able to spit lotus flowers, and exhausts the ability to flatter the American beauty and boast about himself, the high-nosed, blue-eyed beauty, who seems unable to bend her knees when walking, after all, will not be like your same race, same continent's elder brother. As long as the short younger brother is willing to open his golden mouth, they will all listen attentively. Not only listen attentively, but also deeply believe! For example: occupy Shenyang, don't want Jilin and Heilongjiang; occupy Jinzhou, don't want Yuguan; occupy Rehe, don't enter the Great Wall! The National News Agency Washington telegram, on the 14th of last month, lawyer Lin Baek gave a speech at the University of Washington, saying, "Japan's invasion of Rehe has not yet completed its plan to expand its territory. In the future, the world powers will eventually rise up to eliminate the militarism of the Japanese people." The ambition and conspiracy of the Japanese have been revealed by Lin before Matsuoka landed on the American coast. Has Matsuoka not heard of this? How can he still cover his ears and steal the bell today, boasting to the American beauty? Matsuoka has such a great ability to boast and flatter, there is no name for it. It is named: the face is really thick, the courage is full!</p>
<h3>The Departure of Life</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>It has been a full year since Yi Mu left his rosy student life, and it is painful to say that he is not entirely without talent, but he has never been able to find even a basic job. Every time he pursued a way out in life with a heart full of hope, the result was always a great emptiness. The reality truly disappointed him. Even close friends who usually expressed their willingness to help seemed to be playing with soap bubbles—one blown up, another disappearing. This bubble, this dream, had been played out enough.</p>
<p>However, life urgently demands a solution. Even if it means enduring bitter suffering, one must find some kind of support. So, he thought of trying to sell his brainpower. He abandoned all hope, buried his head, and wrote furiously on paper with his pen. Indeed, the output was abundant, and upon reviewing it, he didn't find it too bad. So, he confidently sent his work to various newspapers and magazines. The result? Although not as silent as a stone sinking into the sea, it was still mostly a failure, falling far short of his initial hopes, as if separated by a distance of 108,000 miles.</p>
<p>Naturally, it felt like another dream. The more dreams he had, the more he felt a sense of fear and precariousness in his life.</p>
<p>Then, a new ray of dawn appeared. His friend C, seeing him idle, realized he wasn't cut out for business and said with great enthusiasm, "Let me tell you a way. This method doesn't involve boasting or flattery; it relies entirely on real ability. If it works, it's a golden opportunity. It might solve your own life and even support your family. It's to respond to the recruitment ads that appear in the newspapers every day."</p>
<p>Yes, Yi Mu had thought of this before, but he had always hesitated because he had heard many people say that most of them were tricks. Even if there were genuine opportunities, they all depended on fate. But whether this so-called "fate" was reliable was difficult to understand, so he had never dared to try lightly.</p>
<p>After C's encouragement, he decided to give it a try. He subscribed to a newspaper without hesitation. Sure enough, the very first morning, he opened the paper and found a "Help Wanted" section in the classified ads. He focused his eyes and carefully scanned the listings, and he found one that was looking for several editors. The conditions weren't harsh; all he had to do was send two essays, along with two cents for return postage. It said that after review, the results would be announced in the same section of the same newspaper. He looked at it again and again, as if a ray of gold were dancing on the paper. He thought, "Maybe my time has come!" So, he hurriedly followed the instructions, running to the post office to send it by registered mail. On the way home, he whistled and made a detour to visit his friend C.</p>
<p>He understood that he wouldn't hear back for two or three days, so even though he had subscribed to the newspaper, he always left it untouched. This had been his habit since the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident. He felt that reading the newspaper was the most distressing thing—all he saw were accounts of aggression, suppression, panic, robbery, rape, and so on, filling the pages. He was such a useless person, it was better not to read it to avoid heartache.</p>
<p>On the fifth day, he unconsciously opened the newspaper and found another advertisement in the same section.</p>
<p>On the sixth day, as soon as he opened the first page, his eyes were caught by the prominent headlines "Chengde Falls." He dared not flip further. "The violent Japanese have invaded Rehe, which is only separated from my home province, 乂乂, by a border! Alas!" After a moment of gasping for breath, he still had the heart to continue reading because personal life cannot be abandoned lightly. So, he turned to the local supplement. The first thing that caught his eye was a row of "Self-Employment Introductions," which caused him to gasp for air again.</p>
<p>Finally, with a trembling heart, he turned to the original section and found another advertisement still posted there.</p>

<h3>Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Qian Mengshao</p>
<p>Turning my head, I return to the East Sea,</p>
<p>Winning laughter from the flocking seagulls.</p>
<p>Gains and losses of the petty world are not worth mentioning,</p>
<p>For whom do I come, a horse in the dust?</p>
<p>Returning to the mountains, I failed the pine tree's vow,</p>
<p>This place can barely accommodate the oak's talent.</p>
<p>My ambition of soaring south as a roc is not exhausted,</p>
<p>I pace alone, a small figure between heaven and earth.</p>
<h3>Sent to Qian Sheng Dacheng and Zhang Sheng Chongxian in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Parting at the mountain pass, how can I bear the sorrow?</p>
<p>Your poetic sentiments on the lake surpass mine.</p>
<p>I imagine Xi Shi, adorned and plain,</p>
<p>Sorrow of separation, joy of reunion, I feel like Dongpo.</p>
<p>Boundless flowers, moon, and spring river night,</p>
<p>Alone, I lean on the vastness, singing "Water Melody."</p>
<p>I always think of not betraying our lifelong intentions,</p>
<p>Do not waste the precious moment, worth a thousand gold.</p>

<h3>Repentance</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhi</p>
<p>Since entering school this semester, because I've been renting outside of school with a few lazy friends, I almost never get up before ten o'clock. Even if I wake up earlier, I don't want to get up right away, but just lie in bed, flipping through newspapers or novels. By the time I get up and wash my face, it's already time for lunch. After lunch, we take a few books and go to school to see if any teachers are on leave or if there are any strikes happening. If no teachers are on leave and there are no strikes, and if there's a witty and humorous teacher giving a lecture, we'll go listen. If a physics teacher or a mathematics teacher is rambling on about some formulas and talking about trigonometric functions Sin Cos, we'll yawn, take out our expensive fountain pens, and scribble on our notebooks, or sneak out of class when the teacher isn't looking, and go wander around on the streets or see a movie to relax. In the evening, we go to a restaurant for dinner, and after eating, we go back to our residence together to play four or eight rounds of mahjong, and then go to sleep. This is our daily life, which is also the daily life of Shanghai Modern Students.</p>
<p>"Not sleeping at night, dozing off during the day"—this is probably Mr. Qian's Chinese class! My spirit is exhausted, my eyes are blurred, and I unknowingly drift into sleep. "Zhi'er! You struggled out of a terrible environment to get your education, you are so lucky! You are not comparable to young masters and sons of wealthy families, they are not here to learn, just because they are bored at home and subject to criticism from others, so they come to a higher institution for the production of hooligans, a hotel-like, uncouth school, to get a diploma that is practically a piece of waste paper to deceive their parents and avoid the gossip of others. Playing mahjong, visiting prostitutes, and smoking are nothing to them. You must know that you are a poor boy, you need to seek real knowledge, and create useful talents. You are already nineteen years old, in the third year of high school. Still don't know better, do I need to nag? A collapsing building is hard to support with a single beam. I'm afraid you'll also have problems next semester! Zhi'er! Which parent doesn't want their son to study hard and become famous? If the son is not willing to degrade himself; since you are so unmotivated, I have no more blood and sweat to provide for you. Everything, everything, makes me feel discouraged and disappointed. I don't blame the lack of strict family education, nor do I hate the failure of school education. I only feel that it is easy for a person to become bad, and difficult to become good. You have already received higher education, I ask, what fraction of the four hundred million compatriots have received higher education? The duties of a parent have been fulfilled enough, you find your own way to survive! I no longer want this unpromising son of mine!"</p>
<p>After hearing these words, I felt numb, as if I had been electrocuted. My conscience was greatly reproached, and tears flowed uncontrollably from my eyes. "Father! I understand your words very well. Besides confessing before God, I confess my sins and make amends to you. 'Everything before is as if yesterday has died, everything after is as if today is born.' I will never do this again. Father! Forgive me!" The bell rang, waking me up, and my sleeves were already soaked.</p>

<h3>Resistance</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am a child who has not yet reached adulthood, not only is my family poor, but I am also naturally foolish and have a weak will. I attended elementary school in the countryside when I was young, but later, because my father lost his job, I had no choice but to drop out of school and stay at home. When I was thirteen years old, I followed my father to Shanghai to learn commerce. Since then, I have lived a non-human three-year apprenticeship life. During these three years, I don't know how many grievances and beatings I suffered, and how many tears of blood I shed. Last year, the term of imprisonment was finally over. But my mind is muddled and my personality is weak. The gentlemen and elder brothers consider themselves clever and violent and often deceive me with insults and lies. As for me, not only do I have no ambition to deceive them, but even if they deceive me, I just endure it! Later, my neighbor, Mr. Zhou, became my confidant. Seeing this, he felt indignant and helped me fight them. Although I won every battle, I did not think so in my heart, because their deception only caused me some pain, and it was not worth fighting for. Only when I think about them, I don't know what benefits they get. I really don't understand the minds of clever people and the psychology of violent people.</p>
<p>Sir: Please explain it to me in detail. Finally, I would like to ask you, sir, what attitude should one take when a violent person invades? Resistance? Or endurance? Why do violent people want to invade others? Is violence a sign of intelligence? If everyone in the world were clever and violent, wouldn't it become the barbaric world of ancient times? I wish God would change all the people in the world to be foolish, like me. Then there would be no fear of invasion.</p>
<p>Sir! Goodbye, I wish</p>
<p>You health Wu Xiaxia</p>
<p>乂　　乂　　　乂　　　乂</p>
<p>Editor's Note: From Mr. Wu's letter, we see the seriousness of the unemployment problem; the darkness of the apprenticeship system; the harsh treatment of low-level employees by high-level employees; and the situation of the strong oppressing the weak. In a few words, the various dark sides of a deformed society are fully exposed! However, this is not what Mr. Wu wants us to answer.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's small question symbolizes the present state of China; in the beginning, suffering from the oppression of others, it was always "endurance," but at present, we have indeed felt the urgent need for "resistance." In the process from "endurance" to "resistance," the advantages and disadvantages are clear to everyone. Therefore, our answer to Mr. Wu is "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; to deal with violent aggression, there is only resolute resistance."</p>
<p>At the same time, we must be able to recognize the times and understand reality. If everyone is smart, it certainly won't become the "barbaric world of ancient times"; even if everyone is "foolish," there will definitely not be "no fear of invasion." Therefore, we hope that Mr. Wu will quickly change this way of thinking and cultivate a kind of courage, and be able to be like his friend Mr. Zhou, who helps the weak; otherwise, at least have the power to resist "violence" and "aggression." As for the rest, we think there is no need for "explanation."</p>

<h3>Time in a Dream (Continued from Twenty-One)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Ms. Mao's fluent and delightful conversation greatly amused Wu Yi.</p>
<p>"However, I am an exceptional reader!" Ms. Mao said, with an elegant expression, after the old woman offered tea. "I often tell Yulin that writers are like silkworms, they think and write non-stop, just like silkworms constantly spin silk: spinning silk until the silkworm is exhausted, and writers may never stop the activity of their pens before their spirit is completely exhausted...!"</p>
<p>Yulin brought out a pile of coffee candy from inside, temporarily interrupting his wife's high talk and Wu Yi's listening. "So; I think it is easier to teach than to write!" Ms. Mao innocently peeled off a piece of tin foil from the coffee candy, crumpled it into a ball, and lightly flicked it out the window with one finger. "Mr. Wu! I hope you can give up your position as editor of the newspaper..."</p>
<p>As she said this, Yulin couldn't help but interject, explaining the true intention of their special appointment with Wu Yi today. It turned out that Ms. Mao had a maternal uncle, who was a favorite student of Party and State dignitary 乂乂. He had recently obtained the position of president of the National 乂乂 University. Because he was only a small politician and didn't know much about school affairs, he was afraid of making a fool of himself, so he intended to find someone to be the director of academic affairs; Ms. Mao happened to know about this, and she tried her best to recommend Wu Yi, whom she had always admired and pitied. As a result, she actually got her maternal uncle's approval, so Yulin decided to introduce both parties to meet each other at their home first.</p>
<p>Wu Yi couldn't help but feel a sense of unrequited intimacy because Ms. Mao deeply understood his plight and provided unsolicited and automatic assistance. That night, after meeting their maternal uncle and deciding on the terms of employment, he was still too excited to leave. Ms. Mao's conversation with him was like flowing water, endless. It wasn't until half past eleven that Wu Yi reluctantly returned to the Star News.</p>
<p>Walking out of the Star News and into 乂 University, Wu Yi's life was on the right track. He was even able to breathe the lighter ash of Shanghai air at seven or eight in the morning and see the rising sun. However, years of reporter life had made him develop a bad habit of not being able to sleep until eleven o'clock, and the office hours of 乂 University were only up to six o'clock at most. Wu Yi spent all the remaining free time at Yulin's house.</p>
<p>Because Yulin, as a lawyer, had to socialize, he was not often at home in the evening, but Wu Yi never failed to show up, rain or shine, often talking with Ms. Mao until they were animated and didn't know how late it was. Even when Yulin was at home, what he said wasn't even half of what his wife said.</p>
