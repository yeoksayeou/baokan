<p>時評</p>
<h3>對内</h3>
<p>— 元</p>
<p>日軍閥發動武力。高唱非常時期。論者謂其用意。實以國内經濟恐慌。農村崩潰恐其民心摇動。無法維持。故假國難之名。以刺激其國民。使之奮起一致對外。并轉移其目光以向假想之數。故日本之高呼國難。意在對内也。德國希轉勒之毅然退出國聯。對世界各國。大呼軍備平等。要求自衛。昌言國格之不可一日被辱。迭次演說。激昻慷慨。表示極强硬之態度。論者亦謂其借此以激起其國内不平之人心。使之擁護自己之地位。故其提倡非常時期。亦對内也。昨日日本電訊。述外務省觀察蘇俄局勢之意見。亦謂蘇俄對外之大宣傳。因其國内未一致。故高唱國難之將來。放出種種軍事上不確消息。以刺激其國民。其意亦謂蘇俄之高唱國難爲對内也。夫日俄間今日所傳緊張形勢。是否爲蘇俄之對内。抑爲日本之對内。吾人姑不置論。惟利用此嗜血哲學之劇烈手段。以爲對内工具。則已成爲今日各國政治首領最流行之新政策。惟吾人以爲此種藥針之注入青年身體。第一須問藥與病能適合否。第二須問藥性發後病人之身體能勝任否。若不預爲量度。而貿然一律注射。則非特無效。且多危險。又如商業界投機之人。自身實力未充。一旦失敗。則倉猝失措。必致無法挽救。故今日在國際上應付當前之難題。必先求内外相符。國力與民力致充實。民力充實。則對外無内顧之憂。且可得極大之助力。國力充實。則不慮外來之威脅。且可引起國内之同情。由斯以言。欲僅藉對外誇大驚異之宣傳。以刺激國内之民衆而使向上。或壓抑而使之向下。固皆不可恃。反之而欲藉國内虛憍之民氣。以爲外交之工具。而冀其勝利。亦决非可能之事也。</p>
<p>今我再概括論之。自全世界經濟淪於破落之後。人民生活不安。工廠停閉。貨品無法銷售。於是爭求出路於國外之市塲。然欲於國外市場求出路。不得不先擴張軍備。講求攻禦。欲擴張軍備。講求攻禦。則國際間猜疑以起。糾紛以生。故原高呼國難之所由起。本起於對内。欲藉以保持其國内之安全也。然而國際間糾紛問題旣起。則外交上之應付。自然日趨嚴重。和平漸虞破裂。斯時當局之應付外交。旣成騎虎。一方面仍空言高倡和平。一方面則急備武力以。待最後解决。而又懼國民之懷疑也。於是高倡國難或非常時期。以刺激國民奮起。盡力擁護一己之主張。是可知今日之所謂對内。與初念之所謂對内不同。初念之對内。不過爲國民尋求生活上之出路。而今日之對内。則幾以全國之命運爲賭。而危險有所不計矣。嗚呼。今日之世界。如醉如狂。除盡力於武力之凖備外。復製造種種挑撥戰爭之消息。外以聳動國際之視聽。内以奮興全國之民心。縱轡疾馳。不稍後顧。和平云乎哉。</p>
<p>雖然。國難又非可以一概論也。若遇眞正之國難。理直氣屒之國難。旣爲國家民族生死存亡之所繫。而其人民又爲麻木不仁之人民。則對内之刺激。誠爲必要。否則爲發揮其侵略野心之故。故意舗張揚厲。以製造其所謂國難如日本者。則誠益陷其國於難而已耳。其盡力對内之結果。寗有他途。</p>

<h3>德民意測驗揭曉希特勒大獲勝利　投票踴躍前所未見　什九贊助總理政策</h3>
<p>（柏林）　本日德國全境舉行投票改選衆議院、同時表示對於國家社會黨政府對内對外所行之政策是否贊成結果、果如一般人所預料、國家社會黨大獲勝利、全德人民男女參加投票者異常踴躍、選民參加投票者其百分率從未有如此次之高者、投票之平均結果、在一日之中始終無多大變動、以午後情形計算、在投票人一千六百二十萬名之中、贊成國家社會黨政策者占百分之九十四又一、反對者僅占百分之四又四、無效之票占百分之一又五、至改選衆院之選票中、贊成政府所提薦選單者約占全票數百分之九十二又八、無效之票占百分之七又二、依投票將完畢時之情形計之、選民參加投票者共計四一·二六二·六四二人、其中贊成現政府所行政策者爲三八·五六七·八二五人、反對者僅一·九五三·七三五人、無效之票七四一·○八二張、由此觀之、則贊成政府者約當選民總數百分之五十三又五、反對者占百分之四又七、無效之票爲百分之一又八、此項比例已可視爲定案、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　選舉臨時最後之數字如下、全國計投四三·○○七·五七七票、其中贊同希特勒國會候選人名單者三九·六五五·二八八票、作廢者三·三五二·二八九票、同時舉行公民大會、决定國民是否贊助德國退出國聯與軍縮會、其結果爲四三·四六四·四二○票中、書「是」者四○·六一八·一四七票、書「否」字者二·○五五·三六三票、又廢票七九○·○一○票、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>德國人民贊助政府</h3>
<p>（柏林）　德國人民大多數表示贊同國家社會黨國會候選員名單及德國退出國聯與軍縮會、今夜十一時已檢視二五、三七七、九零一票、其中贊助國家社會黨者二三五八三五七五票、廢票一、七九四、三二六票、答覆政府所問是否贊助政府之政策、而願莊嚴誓守之者、夜間十一時共已檢視二五、七八零、二四一票、其中書「是」者二四、二零五、九九八票、書「否」字者一、一五七、零三五票、作廢者四一七、二零八票、截至今晚八時止、選民百分之九十以上、顯已投贊助政府票、故政府之勝利已無可疑、</p>
<p>本年三月間舉行選舉時、希特勒受一千七百萬人之擁護、此次則增至三千萬矣、其最大特點之一、爲三月間舉社會黨或共産者之一千二百萬人、今皆投國家社會黨票、足證希特勒以掃滅德國馬克斯主義與布爾希維克主義自豪者、其言信不誣也、</p>
<p>德國事前曾發評論、謂此次選舉乃於世界武力或建設二者之中定取舍、德國政策已切實决定從事建設矣、今當聽他人好自爲之、惟必以平等權利爲基礎、凡願爲和平主義效勞者、不得談裁　·報復·或不以薩爾區城歸還德國、</p>
<h3>選舉投票異常踴躍</h3>
<p>此次選舉、投票者異常踴躍、往往須竚待數小時、始能行近票匭、挺進隊分乘摩托敞車、歷至各投票處、以軍樂娱竚候之投票者、食肆與啤酒肆營業之盛逈異尋常、投票者多痛飲慶祝、寓於德境外之德人多結隊回國投票、惟廢皇維廉仍居荷境、其子與皇族中人則均至波資丹投票、有許多處全村或全鎭一致投擁護希特勒票、偶有一二人投反對票者、正午、選區投票者、已逹百分之九十、前共産黨根據地之實業區、尤形踴躍、</p>
<h3>希特勒赴工廠投票</h3>
<p>希特勒未如其他閣員之在政府區投票、而驅車赴西門子工廠工人飲食所投票、按星期五日希特勒之播音演說、即在是廠發出者、</p>
<p>柏林等城、尤其實業中心點、均爲人最所注目者、因往日皆贊助共和黨與共産黨也、而觀此次投票結果、則已證明希特勒已在此諸城得勢矣、</p>
<p>此次國家社會黨候選人名單中雖無一女子、而女子仍悄然接受希特勒之名單、按德國女子自加入國會後、曾提出社會法制、以改善大戰時毁壞之全國衛生、其勞績殊足多者、</p>
<p>今日有學董數千、列隊經過各街道作軍操步伐、表示「榮譽與和平」、</p>
<p>柏林今日其安靜、全國各處亦未聞發生事端、現信此次選舉中未傷一人、選舉之揭貼、雖在前共産黨根據地各區、亦絶少爲人撕下者、而警察未見多於平日、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>沉默安靜前所罕見</h3>
<p>（柏林）　今日德國之自决投票、其舉行之沉默、實爲前所未見、各投票所自晨九時即開始、而人民則自夜一時即開始齊集於投票所前、後至者須列隊佇候於投票所門前、每人各空白投票紙、上書「德國之男女同胞、汝贊成汝政府此次之政策乎、汝願奉守此政策以爲汝自已之政策乎、」今　選舉之特點、爲當場並無警察監視、此次投票亦爲不具名式、票匭於事後當衆開視、現投票尚未畢、但在東普魯士一百四十七萬選民之中、已有一百四十二萬人投票、國會選舉一百四十萬票中、國家社會黨竟佔一百三十七萬票之多云、在多倫幾亞境内有一百六十萬人投票、其中一百五十六萬係贊成政府者云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　此次自决投票及國會選舉、雖投票人數普通在百分之九十三四之間、但有數選舉區、其投票數竟有超過百分之百以上者、故實爲德國空前之大踴躍投票也、在曼茵斯農民區域内、人民之出而投票者居百分之九十七、而二萬二千五百票之中、有二萬一千係贊成政府之舉動者、在巴伐利亞之板堡、人民之投票佔數百分之九十九、而三萬七千票中竟有三萬五千係贊成政府者、而贊成國家社會黨國會者亦佔三萬二千票云、在柏林附近工業區域、前爲共産黨徒之巢穴者、今亦普遍贊助政府、以大勢而論此次國會選舉之投票、較之自决投票略見缺少云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>獄中犯人一致擁護</h3>
<p>（柏林）　據希持勒及其閣員眼光觀之、德國人民已對世界表明其擁護國家社會黨和平政现之誠意、此次普選希特勒已獲全勝、即被繫於獄中之犯人、亦一律傾向國家社會黨、聞政府方面、對於政治犯能信仰國家社會主義、頗爲嘉許、不久、或將對政治犯下令大赦云、</p>
<p>柏林城選舉之結果、擁護希特勒者有一百十三萬一百三十三票、與本年三月對國會選舉時之三十九萬八千六百八十七票相差甚遠、</p>
<p>宣傳部長爲慶祝國家社會黨選舉勝利起見、已下令全國民衆於今日懸旗慶祝、</p>
<p>選舉時、惟一之不幸事件、即爲德特蒙地方、有一共産黨徒散發傳單、因企圖逃避、乃被警察開槍擊斃、</p>
<h3>將來計劃中央集權</h3>
<p>希特勒之未來計劃、不久即將宣佈、聞政府已準備大規模之憲政改革、其第一步辦法將爲取消聯邦制、爲行政便利計、依照法國之方法、使德國劃分爲若干區域、實行中央集權制云、</p>
<p>據官方發表之臨時、最後投票之統計、希特勒國會候選名單之投票者、逹四千二百九十七萬五千零九票、其中三千九百六十二萬六千六百四十七票、爲贊成國家社會黨者、三百三十四萬八千三百六十六票爲廢票、同時民大會之表决贊成德國退出國聯與軍縮會投票者之結果、總數爲四千三百四十三萬九千零四十六票、書「是」者、計四千零五十八萬八千八百零四票、書「否」者二百一十萬零一百八十一票、作廢者計七十五萬零六十一票云、（十二日路透電）、</p>
<h3>德選舉史空前創舉</h3>
<p>（柏林）　今晨德國各報對於昨日選舉結果、皆表示歡悅、謂舉世無一政治家能以得其國人信任如希特勒而自豪者、據最後報告、自該投票共四千零五十八萬八千張、其中書「是」者佔百分之九五·一、國會選舉贊助國家社會黨之票共三千九百六十二萬六千張、故新國會將以議員六百八十人組成之、選民之投票者佔百分之九六、此實德國選舉史上人數最多之一次、廢票與書「否」字之票僅百分之五、午夜後、選舉第一次臨時報告、已證明希特勒勝利、希氏即發表一文、申謝國民與黨員之忠實、及彼等之表示眞正愛護和平與榮譽平等（十三日國民電）</p>
<h3>投票熱無遠弗屆</h3>
<p>慕尼黑　此處良牧道院之全體女尼、均一致投贊成政府之政策及國社黨國會之票、德國最高之山嶽名蘇格斯畢兹者、位巴伐利亞亞爾伯山中、該地冬季游客及旅館之職工、亦一致投贊成政府之票云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>黑伐爾　此次德國選舉、僑居國外之德人、亦紛紛回國投票、愛沙尼亞之德僑五百人、租一德國貨船、至芬蘭灣中立部分投票、按照國際法、貨船載客不得超過十二人、愛沙尼亞當道特准德僑同乘此船、惟須人各備一救生圈、並另以打撈船一艘隨行、此可徵德人對投票之熱心矣、（十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>歐洲各國之反響法惶慮和約前途　意信希特勒可和緩　日内瓦抱同様見解　惟奥仍厲行戒嚴令</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　法國人士對於凡兩賽和約之前途頗覺惶慮、有數方面以爲德國人民什九已贊成可導成大戰爭之政策、及種種違反文明原則之計畫、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　德國選舉之結果原無足異、所可異者厥爲德人中竟有百分之五敢公然投反對國家社會黨之票、英法人士皆以爲希特勒無論如何必獲多數、惟也納則以爲如自由投票、則希特勒决不能得半數、奥官塲恐境内國家社會黨暴動、現仍厲行戒嚴令、意人視國社黨之得勢、爲法西斯主義之勝利、並入希特勒今將表示和緩之姿勢、俾日内瓦軍縮會議得以復開、日内瓦之人士亦抱此同様見解、英國每日驛報謂希特勒今後可如期望軍縮與和平之政治家行事、而非如期　票數之政客矣、泰晤士報載洛　爵士一函、謂吾人必諒解德國之觀念、否則歐洲將分爲兩個對峙的軍營云、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>各國報紙認爲無足駭異　注意柏林羅馬此後態度</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　法國報紙評論德國選舉、表示失望、謂日軍耳曼帝國之虛驕、前消滅於大戰中者、今漸復活、任帕特報且主張法國佔據德國、以防再起戰爭、一　輿論以爲希特协星期五日所發之和平言論、係對英意兩國而　、恐意國或將傾向柏林而抛棄日内瓦、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　今晨各報對於德國選舉結果多持保留態度、均以爲此種結果、本在意料之中、不足駭異、法國所足注意者固不在此、而在於希特總總理未來之策動、蓋公民投票之結果、可使希特勒放棄其等待政策、而出於積極態度也、因此法國各報、均抱觀望態度、咸謂今後自柏林及羅馬傳來之各項消息、均當加以密切之注意云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>關於華北戰區未了事件，經岡村與黃何兩委員長會晤後，對於實行之原則，已商定相當範圍，將來中日雙方即按照此範圍進行，其中事件約分三項，（一）北寗通車問題，因關内外路線本係北寗鐵路所有，故當局按照我方原則，定有通車辦法，轉致關東軍，彼方如同意時，則短期内當可實現，岡村昨日已將此項辦法携帶赴津，俟抵長春後再轉致關東軍當局，將來進行上，即由北寗路局長殷同於鐵道部參事夏光宇恊助下，與日本使館交涉，關東軍方面爲求便利起見，此後一切事件，亦完全由日使館代爲辦理，（二）長城各口設稅關事，在前東北各稅關係設在營口濱江等地，現旣不能行使職權，如驟移設長城各口，似不甚妥，故此事商談範圍，即係將營口濱江等關暫移後方辦公，並非在長城各口公開設關收稅，至僞國方面在山海關古北口等地設立之稅關，决不承認，（三）交還長城各口及日軍撤退，因塘沽恊定已有規定，當無問題，（十一日）</p>

<p>廣州通信，粤第二軍長香翰屏，自兩度呈請辭職後，態度堅决，日昨香氏復作公開之談話，表明辭職意志，略謂此次辭職無他原因，不過以精力日衰，遇事叢挫，故擬休養，本人自民國五年入軍籍，至今十七年，値國家多故，無時不處於憂患之境，致染心神忡悸之病，顧此十餘年努力經過，上不能捍衛國家，下不能造福桑梓，撫心自問，衿影多慚，故宜避位讓賢及時引退，以蓋前愆，但辭職後，决不離廣州，且不寄居香港，免起外間謡諑云云，香旣辭職，其所部咸大失所望，如第四師長張枚新免職以來，陳濟棠聲言將予優缺，張亦掉頭不顧，第四師之副師長巫劍虹，第四師所轄第十一團長李億榮·第十二團長陳經，均係追隨香氏甚久，對香張二人去職，亦同其進退，已在信豐防次，具呈辭職，而代理二軍軍務之參謀長葉敏予，代理綏署政務之　謀長李郁焜，亦相繼呈辭，昨陳濟棠均批飭着仍負責辦理公務，俟物色斡員繼任，再行批令遵照，所請辭職之處，應毋庸議云，</p>
<p>近日繼香氏消極者，尙有南區綏靖委員陳辜甫，與西南政務會委員蕭佛成，陳之辭呈遞上後，已從令慰留，辭意當可打銷，憲係請假，雖經政務會力挽，惟决於下月内赴暹一行，據蕭對人談，彼之赴暹，係因暹邏近日内亂，彼在暹經營之業務受影響，亟待料理賬目，其次，本人家屬與暹人有關係，今暹邏發生變故，本人須回家視察，至遲下月即要首途等語，西南政務會以蕭氏回暹，不無影響務，故極力挽留蕭氏展期離粤，同時電促在桂之李宗仁同廣州，以便主持政務會公務，聞李氏接電後，已允起程來粤，大約日間可到，（十一月七日）</p>
<h3>鄂省黨部指斥孟廣澎　致函省府歷述孟氏之錯誤　令各縣黨部監督地方政府</h3>
<p>漢口通信，國民黨湖北省黨部，　此次黃梅縣黨部呈控該縣縣長黃丹初，違法凟職，因手續未合，致遭民政廳長孟廣澎之侮辱，特向中央提出彈劾，黨政間因以發生誤會，現經中央視察員于錫來，居間調處，已有解釋之希望，惟省黨部對此，認爲關係重大，昨又致函省府，指斥孟廣澎謬舉，並令縣黨部，仍應負責監督地方政府，不得稍有瞻徇，兹錄函令如次，</p>
<h3>致省政府函</h3>
<p>大意指斥孟廣澎五點，（一）黃梅縣黨部呈控該縣縣長，黃丹初一案，業經了結，該孟廣澎竟將此項不應公布且已結束之事件，擅違貴府原令，令仰所屬張貼佈告，遍及城鄉，當此邪說横行，該廳竟以黨治下所屬之行政機關，該孟廣澎又係供職黨治下之行政官吏，亦公然對於黨部肆意侮辱，爲黨治前途計，實深危懼（二）中央迭次議决，政務官須用黨員，該孟廣澎未向本會所屬黨部移轉登記，究竟是否黨員，無從查悉，即令非黨員，然旣爲黨治下之政務官，對於本黨總章，自有遵守服從之義務，今竟命令所屬對於黨部恣意侮辱，向黨外民衆，公布下級黨部之錯誤，是其違反黨紀，至爲明顯，（三）依據訓政綱領，訓政約法，及訓政時期黨務進行計劃，在訓政時期中，本黨代表國民行使中央統治權，並同級黨部對於同級政府之用人行政司法，及其舉措，認爲不合時，有監督檢舉之權，是黃梅縣黨部之檢舉該縣縣長，原則實無不當其所錯誤者，僅爲檢舉之手續，乃該佈告，儼然嚴加訓斥，是又置一切訓政法規於不顧，且將本會懲奬之極，概行侵奪，（四）佈告原文，引據豫鄂皖三省勦匪區内暫行黨務整理綱要第八項之規定，認定黃梅縣黨部係屬干涉地方行政，不知上述綱要第八項中，雖有不得以黨部或黨員之名義，干涉地方行政或司法之語句，但下文即接有但遇公務員有違法凟職之行爲者，得搜集實據，由縣黨部轉達本部或省政府核辦之詞句，乃該孟廣澎竟斷章取義，又對干涉二字，作牽强附會之解釋，以遂其恣　係辱之計，（五）凡請示上級機關核示之案件，在未得上級機關批示决定以前，即不能擅行辦理，佈告原文所論重申禁令，不過貴府向上級機關之建議，乃該廳在未得所呈奉之機關核准以前，遽自行重申禁令，若非藐視上級機關，即爲存心侮辱本會，除呈請中央及軍委長南昌行營依法懲行外，相應臚列經過情形，並申述理由函達貴府云云，</p>
<h3>令各縣黨部</h3>
<p>「案查本會第一百五十一次會議，臨時動議查豫鄂皖勦匪區内暫行黨務整理綱要第八條内載，各縣黨部，不得以黨部或黨員名義對]外，尤不得以黨部或黨員名義，干涉地方行政司法事件，此種規定，因本黨工作方式，趨於秘必，用意固屬至善，但中國國民黨在訓政府期代表人民行使四權，故各級黨部，對於同級政府之行政，自有　督之權限，擬請通令各縣黨部對於當地政府之措施，應秘密監督，期有違反本黨主義，或貪汚惟事，須搜集證據，密呈本會，轉函省政府核辦，是否有當，請公决案，决議通過，紀錄在卷，查黨政各有系統，不得以黨部或黨員個人名義，直接干涉地方行政司法，或逕呈該管上級機關，前經通令尊照在卷，惟本黨在兹訓政時期，訓練人民行使四權，在人民未知運用，本黨尙未授權於民之先，倘有違反本黨主義或貪污情事發生，即須搜羅確切證據，密呈本會核辦，不得稍有瞻徇，或意氣用事，以致貽譏外人，而干黨紀，此令，」（十一日）</p>

<h3>京滬路貨車昨在和平門出軌　岔道夫未將轍尖扳妥　機車水軌及貨車出軌　昨日上下午交通阻斷　至下午五時始行修復</h3>
<p>京滬鐵路第三三一次下行貨列車於昨晨零時許、駛抵南京和平門車站、因岔道夫未將轍尖扳妥、致機車水櫃及貨車四輛出軌陷落、一時上下交通、皆被阻斷、直至昨日下午五時許、始行完全修復、兹將詳細情形、分誌於後、</p>
<h3>出事經過</h3>
<p>先是第三一六次上行貨車掛車二十七輛、於前晚十一時五十二分、駛抵和平門站停靠支道、候京來第三三一次下行貨車前往交會、第三三一次下行車掛車二十輛、續於十一時五十八分抵站、擬由直道通過、不意岔道夫未將轍尖扳妥、至水櫃車、曁裝載傷兵之三十噸車一輛·四十噸車三輛·均軼出軌外陷落、交通全被阻斷、</p>
<h3>事後布置</h3>
<p>肇事後、和平門站長立即發電乞援、京站得訊、即於昨晨零點四十分由江邊站派出調車機頭、前往出事地點、將該列車後端未出軌貨車十五輛、於一時三十七分、拖回南京、一面由駐京閔工程司、督率全體工人、乘坐救險車、於二時零七分、抵和平門車站、從事工作、停靠該站灣道上之三一六次上行貨車、亦於三時十六分、設法退回堯化門站、</p>
<h3>客車被阻</h3>
<p>前晚由滬開京之第六次上行夜車、於昨晨六時五十分抵和平門站、多數旅客、即在該站下車、第三零二次聯運通車及其他列車、亦多被延誤、所有六次車中在和平門未下車旅客、則由京站另派專機掛客車三輛、前往迎接、於七時五十五分抵京、故昨晨由京開出之各次客列車亦皆被阻、暫緩起程、</p>
<h3>修理工程</h3>
<p>該路駐京閔工程司及大批工匠抵和站後、趕將直道設法出清、於昨日上午十一時四十五分即告工竣、先行恢復交通、但仍不能交車、故昨日由京來滬各車、均延遲數小時之多、至支道則於下午四時五十六分、始行修復、</p>
<h3>傷兵虛驚</h3>
<p>昨日出軌之貨車四輛、皆裝載第九陸軍後方醫院、由南昌運來轉往杭州醫治之剿匪受傷兵士、幸皆安臥車内、故未再受傷害、然已飽受虛驚矣、</p>
<h3>查究責任</h3>
<p>該路車務處長鄭寳照氏、於事後即飭令京滬段事務段長陳鍾英·副總段長廟朝元·二氏、切實查究負責員工、以便呈報局長處决、</p>

<h3>收付水費辦法</h3>

<h3>第五屆童軍大檢閱昨日給奬閉幕　拔營後並參觀市府新屋始散</h3>

<h3>學生不滿新敎務主任務本女中發生風潮　▲敎育局長及校長被禁四小時　▲學生五百餘人赴市政府請願　敎局令暫行停課</h3>
<p>市立務本女子中學校長王孝英、因專任立法委員、故於九月間、呈請辭去校長職、當由敎育局校准、並另選閻振玉女士接替、不意新校長蒞任後、因前敎務主任程賡祚辭職、閻校長另聘姜文寳、不意引起學生方面不滿、釀成絶大風潮、昨晨潘局長乘出席紀念週機會、蒞校勸導、遽被全校學生包圍達四小時、直至正午十二時許、始由警士保護之下、突圍而去、兹將各情分誌如下、</p>
<h3>易長原因</h3>
<p>務本女中校長王孝英女士、向來兼任立法委員之職、惟依照中學法之規定、中學校長應爲專任職、王校長遂屢向教局呈請辭職、惟潘局長以王校長治校多年、故均加以挽留、惟勸其辭去立法委員之職以遵法令、今年暑假前、王校長曾經向敎局表示、願往辭立法委員職、專任務本校長、故暑假後王女士仍然繼任、然至九十月間王校長忽又突向潘局長表示辭意、挽留無效、至十月二十五日提出辭呈、敎局乃發表以前國立曁大敎授現任大夏敎授閻振玉女士繼任務本校長、一切仍照常進行、敎職員除有一二人自願辭職者外、亦均蟬聯任敎、絶未加以更動、</p>
<h3>風潮突起</h3>
<p>至新聘敎務主任、姜文寳、曾任該校黨義敎員、及中華職業曁敬業兩中學敎課及訓育主任等職、對於敎育經騐、尚稱宏富、不料該校一部份學生、竟受少數不良份子之煽惑惑、藉口反對姜主任、醖釀學潮、行動越軌、言論反常、閻校長雖加以勸導、亦無效果、不得已乃報告潘局長將爲首之學生方秀芝·李敏華·二人、囑其暫行休學、卽由該二生之家長領回勸導、許其子悔悟後、再行回校、以示寛大、乃少數不良學生、反藉此擴大風潮、至昨日（十三日）上午、乃有包圍閻校長及敎局潘局長之越軌行動發生、</p>
<h3>學生條件</h3>
<p>昨晨八時許、閻校長到校後、卽被全體學生、包圍在辦事室内、要求答允條件、一休學兩生、立卽恢復上課、二、撤換新敎務主任姜文寳、三、准許、學生自治會活動、閻校長無法應付、遂遭包圍、</p>
<h3>包圍局長</h3>
<p>嗣敎育局長潘公展氏、以務本發生暗潮、擬於紀念週時赴校向學生勸導、切弗受人利用、以免荒廢學業、學生等遂請潘局長至外面廣場中訓話、潘局長當時卽向各學生解釋撤換校長、係王校長本人自辭、且曾數度堅挽、學生等旣不反對新校長、應絶對聽從新任校長、而各女生仍堅持原議、須潘局長允許學生所提之條件、方允上課、且書一紙條、勒令潘局長簽字、不遂則用包圍校長方法、將局長軟困、該校敎職員、則無人出而問訊、直至十一時許、始有一敎員名俞長源者、出而向學生勸告、但經各學生堅拒、仍一無結果</p>
<h3>鎖禁校門</h3>
<p>學生等旣將校長敎育局長包圍、復將全校敎室及校長鎖禁、敎育局各職員、雖知局長校圍在内、無法入校、嗣二一區公安局得訊、當由李區長率警馳維持、以免釀成意餐、當由該校後門口、破門入内直至十二時許、始保護潘局長及閻校長出外、經各女生拉扯撑拒、各警士均係糾糾武夫、故有少數女士、略受損失傷云、</p>
<h3>事實眞相</h3>
<p>緣潘局長於昨晨八時赴該校、原擬在紀念週中向學生報告王校長去職眞相、勸導學生、安心向學、時該校一部份學生正將閻校長包圍、藉收回休息二生等之成命爲由、作强迫請願、潘局長乃親自當衆演說、將易長經過及二學生休學原因、一一報告、最後乃申說本人對務本女學期望之殷、勸導學生等勿爲越軌之行動、然少數不良學生、竟無理可喻、一時秩序大亂、竟將閻校長衣服撕破、並毆打敎局職員、甚全脫去高跟皮鞋投擲、爲路人拾獲、公安局第二區李區長聞訊、率領區員及徒手警士前往維持秩序、亦屬無效、潘局長見學生等無理可喻、深爲惋惜、當即由敎局職員伴同退出、學生復蜂擁追趕、勢如潮湧、互相擠軋、致二人微傷、學生遂送至瞿直夫醫院騐傷、經敎局派員向該院調查、據該院醫生答復、騐得胸臀二部受擠稍傷、卽行出院、外傳二生受傷甚重、及輕傷者七八人、實無其事、</p>

<h3>及時購買</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>儲蓄是美德，這是誰都知道的。所以拖着鼻涕的小寳貝，能够把買糖菓的錢，叮咚叮咚地藏在撲滿裏的，老子娘便都拉開了嘴合不攏來。推而廣之，百萬富翁，吃着大鏞鏞，棒子麫，穿着青布棉袍，黑布局褂，而把大塊兒金，小塊兒銀，去窖藏在地底下，大家都没命的恭維他是「節儉可風」。</p>
<p>不過這種美德，據經濟學家說，是「此風斷不可長」的。因爲經濟的形成，是全賴貨幣的流通。貨幣流通得越快，經濟的組織越穩固，而國家社會也愈繁榮。假使每一個小寳貝都把買糖菓的錢，叮咚叮咚地塞在撲滿裏，不用說，各街各衖口的糖菓小販，將大受影響，就是同治年間始創的糖菓店，怕不也要大閙其不景氣麽？以小例大，我們也就可以見到百萬富翁，捨不得吃，捨不得穿，没命地擴展藏糨的地域，影響於國家與社會的經濟組織的程度了。</p>
<p>美國這些時，正大玩其通貨的把戲。羅斯福總統，勸人「及時購買」，就是這一層大道理。其實美國人，正也不用羅斯福氏的勸告，早已「及時購買」，行之有年矣。他們的貨幣不能流通的癥結所在，並不是民衆們的，一錢如命」，實在是因爲「二手空空」。當美國未被不景氣侵襲的時候，工人有自備汽車的很多，這還不算是「及時購買」麽？所以美國人的「及時購買」，倒並不在乎「雙九扣」，「倒八折」等調調兒，而應當着眼於如何使民衆有「購買力」。因爲美國人有的是「今朝有酒今朝醉」的民族性。</p>
<p>在中國，我以爲倒很可以提倡一下子「及時購買」，免得富翁們守財成虜，而累得市場蕭索。但是對於一般摩登男女，却該極力地提倡儲蓄，因爲他們早已「明朝有酒今朝醉」，演吃了卯糧的了呀。</p>
<h3>吻的集錦</h3>

<p>（二）吻的辭典　吻是：孩子的權利愛人的私産　僞君子的假面；和一個青春的少女接吻是丨信仰，一個已婚的婦人接吻是丨希望，一個年老的婦人接吻是丨慈善。</p>
<p>（三）吻和藝術家　藝術家丨在我的摸特兒中，你是第一個被我接吻。摸特兒丨你曾僱過多少摸特兒？藝術家丨四個：一隻蘋果，兩隻香蕉，一個甜瓜。　　（四）吻的紀錄　在紐約，有一次舉行不停頓接吻競賽，最初兩天之中，有三對男女，每對長吻的紀錄，時間都是六十六分半。爲什麽到了這個時刻，都要中止？爲什麽不能再繼續下去？氣的不接，嘴唇上肌肉的疲乏或者覺得乏味了，這的確是一個耐人研究的問題。假如伊們改用了新的方式，或許吻的紀錄，會進步而增長吧？</p>
<p>（五）吻的偷竊。在日本，曾經有逈偷吻的風潮。偷吻的青年，都騎在自由車上，到處巡行，在路上看見了美貌少女，便把身體傴下去，趁那少女不防備之時，吻了幾下，接着便飛也似的逃去了，被吻的少女，眞是奈何他不得。但這種偷吻的技術也要經過一翻訓練。</p>
<p>（六）吻的測騐　一個男子，竭望了好、</p>
<p>久，想和一個少女接吻：但第一次得到了機會時，每是十九因缺乏勇氣而不敢。一個少女，雖然很願和情人接吻但第一次被他吻的時候總要假裝推拒的。</p>
<p>一個女人，第一次和男子接吻，伊的臉上，一定要赤化像偷了人家的東西一様。</p>
<h3>有趣的離婚統計</h3>
<p>— 趙匡胤</p>
<p>世界上離婚案最多的國家，就是美國。法院所有案件的計算，以離婚案佔十分之六以上。最近華盛頓法律家佐賽甫詹森，將紐約的離婚案件逐一統計的得到很有趣的結論，據他的統計中說，離婚人物最多的是藝術界，尤其是電影明星佔多數，此外音樂舞台及劇界中人，亦不少，學界商界次之，政治界人物因爲環境關係而變遷亦多，勞動階級却極少極少。</p>
<p>離婚的原因爲經濟問題發生衝突的佔多數，在以前有爲了愛好的不同，而發生齟齬，以致離婚的，占百分之四十以上，紐約某地有一件離婚案，要求離異的原因，十分簡單而有趣，因爲丈夫歡喜蓄鬍子，又歡喜養貓，他的妻子反對，所以雙方就互相提出了離異的條件還有因爲妻子不能燒好的東西給丈夫吃，以致丈夫不樂而離異的，亦占百分之三十以上，所以女子對於烹飪的技種，實在是必需的條件。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十八回　脈脈傳茶含悲慰夫婚　怱怱出塞强笑别家人</p>
<p>這一篇理由還不曾說完營部派人來傳話，營長請連長去領東西。領東西這總是好事，趙自强便立刻前去。到了營長辦公室裏，只見那桌上用大報紙包着，堆放了好幾個紙包。紙包上用紅筆寫了第幾連的字様。營長賓芳，指着一個紙包向他笑道：救國聯合會，聽到我們出發了，送了，送了許多暑藥給咱們。團部裏就分配好了，一連得着一包，你帶回去罷。趙自强又覺得是這様不要緊的事。大概營長在團長那裏是鄭而重的拿來，所以也要連長鄭而重之的受了去，這有什麽話可說，只好拿了那個紙包回連部了。到了連部裏，少不得又把這一大包藥打開來，交給三個排長，表分給弟兄們。這一層可省了的麻煩，未曾結束，隨從兵就進屋來說：那個雜貨店裏的掌櫃，自己又來了。我說連長出去。他說，他親自看到連長上樓的。他並不要錢，只要和連長說幾句話。趙自强想了一想道：我下去見他罷。下得樓來，只見那位掌櫃劉君，靠了墻角站着，腦袋幾乎是竽到懷裏面去。趙自强先呌着他道：劉掌櫃，我眞對不住，現在上面没有發餉，要了我的命，也拿不出錢來。那劉掌櫃，帶了哭音道：您不給就不給罷。我只求求您到了防地，有錢多少給我寄一點來罷。趙自强看了，眞是不忍，便問道：連新帶舊，我一共欠你多少錢？劉掌櫃道：大概二十來塊錢吧？要是您這一處，我也没什麽可說的，交個朋友罷，可是别人還欠着呢。他說時，抬起一隻袖子去揉擦眼晴。趙自强眞不過意，就在身上掏出兩塊現洋交給了他，那劉掌櫃很知足，千恩萬謝的去了。（二三九）</p>
<h3>蠻幹</h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>小孩子向父母需索銅元，食物，設不如願，他們能亂哭亂吵，這種蠻幹的辦法，最容易引起父母的肝火。</p>
<p>做妻子的口口聲聲說是爲的交際問題，又麻雀，看電影，終日終夜不歸，伊的丈夫對於這種蠻幹的夫人，因爲不敢開口，只得坐在家裏吁氣。</p>
<p>我們同種的敵人，不顧國際信義，强佔我國土地，一味只知蠻幹到底，强權抺煞公理，世界遂無安寗之日。</p>
<p>强徒殺人放火，打家刦舍，不知仁慈爲何物，小百姓遇到這種蠻幹的朋友，只得捨家財而顧性命，脚底明白，溜之大吉。</p>
<p>四川省的錢糧，據說已預微到民國四十七年以後，這種横徵暴斂的官吏，他們一味蠻幹，只知實行官肥民瘦的主義，小百姓的死活，却始終不能相顧。</p>
<p>無知識的婦女，在氣忿無聊的時候，每每以死嚇人，死是潑婦們實行蠻幹政策的手溜彈，爆裂後，往往弄假成眞，造成不可收拾的局面。</p>
<h3>女子公寓</h3>
<p>— 胡菊珍</p>
<p>因職業門戶的漸趨開放，女子的經濟獨立比較從前也稍容易些，但是職業界的婦女寄宿問題，也就同時感覺困難了。我就是這其中的一個。去年我自本埠某某大學商科畢業以後，很幸運地立刻就找到了一個位置，每月薪水還不錯，有七十五元。因爲我的父母是住在華南，於是我的寄宿問題，也就立刻起了困難。起初，我是住在一個已婚的女友家裏，伊有三個孩子，居的是一樓一底的房子。我雖每月了伊二十五元，但是我感覺許多不便，尤其使我難堪的，是伊同丈夫時常吵嘴，爲避免嫌疑，在兩個月以後，我就藉故搬到一家亭子間裏去了。那知在這裏，我不但感覺飲食的不便，那寂寞的生活，反遭人家的誤會，呌我比以前更難堪了。幸得後來有一位朋友，告訴我到吕班路蒲柏路口，中華婦女節制會所辦的上海女子公寓去住，果然，名實相節，這公寓確是旅滬婦女最高尙，最方便的住所。不但交能便利，宿膳費也極低廉，熱水終日備有，冬有火爐，夏有電扇，用人亦極勤謹。我來此已逾一年，一切都覺滿意，因想與我有同様需要的姊妹很多，所以値得我來介紹一下。（却酬）</p>
<p>逰踪所至</p>
<h3>天平紀遊</h3>
<p>— 吟秋</p>
<p>蘇州本是富有名勝的地方，加以今秋游興　佳，所以半月之中，一游獅林，再游虎邱，覽泉石的秀美，窮林壑的幽深；仰着倪迂高風，訪那生公遺跡；撫今追昔，把酒聯吟，原是人生的樂事。可是節逾重陽，秋光正好，更欲一登天平以爲快！便在那休沐之日，黎明卽起，偕余妻碧筠兒子百康出胥關，貢棹而往；同游的有周子玉田陳君如侃季侃三人，陳爲碧筠女弟，周乃昔年同學。七時解糧，一聲欵乃，放乎中流，舟人袁姓，瀹茗享客，舟中布置，很見整潔，蓬穿竹几，織塵不染，偃生其中，可稱舒適極了。沿途望着田野風　，秋色可人，牧童樵叟，漁翁農婦都呈著熙熙之象</p>
<p>水程將近過半，青山隱隱可見，玉田笑指百康道：這是穹　，這是靈岩，那是七子上方，羣巒起伏，宛如屏列；可是天平，却還在地烟雲杳靄中哩！又前行，約半時，路漸漸的近了，山也漸漸的顯了。將到山麓的時候，我們便在舟中，進食充飢，岸上的村婦們，競來兜攬轎子，也有少女以此爲業的，男子却不多見，想在田間工作罷。旣停了船，我們上岸，玉田季侃，健步登山，百康喜極，也跳躍相從。我們乘了竹兜行，山中女子，矯捷如飛，循山徑，屈曲前進，經童子門，玉田出影盒合攝一影。海上電影公司常到其地攝片，所以銀幕上也是常見的，因爲御道傾斜，山岡高聳，眞是别有奇趣。過此便見長松蒼翠，巨石嶙峋，接近文正的墓地了，俗稱。「范墳」，松有數千，石也的萬，矗峙霄漢，形同朝笏，便所謂一萬笏朝天一咧！</p>
<p>輿人到此休息，我們先在高義園小坐，再取了間道上山，路益險，石益奇，其境也益勝；過「觀音喦，」到「線天」，崖壁峭立，中闢而通，巖旁刻「雲磴」二字，攀登直上，歷數十級，忽又空闊，到「頭陀崖，」憇立俯視，全山在目，臨風舒嘯，塵襟頓釋了！我和百　止於此，又倩玉田攝留一影，餘人都奮勇努力，直到「望湖台」「照湖鏡，」可謂豪壯了。這時游人漸多，某女校學生，也遠足到此，寂寞山靈，頓形熱閙。山童有賣手杖的，可資登山之助，人手一杖，生涯大盛，百康見了，也買一杖。正游眺時，玉田和登山諸人下，便同訪「雲泉精舍，舍旁有「白雲亭，」年久失修，傾圮欲墮。旣入，見一石當門，上刻「岫雲」，折而進，石壁中有泉一線，名「一線泉，」又進，便是「白雲泉，」泉從石隙下注，承以鉢盂，又名「鉢盂泉，一涓涓不已，不溢也不涸，味極甘冽，號稱吳中第一泉。</p>
<p>老僧悟眞，懇懃欵接，引登小閣，烹泉茗坐，見壁間楹聯很多，有趙宦光的「池淺還容月」，「山高不碍雲；」范玉琨的「萬笏皆從平地起」「一峰常插白雲；」都屬佳句。又有余天前的「入室止觀泉眼活，」「對山平揖塔尖高；」故人遺墨，對之悵然！老僧云：「一月前順德連聲海，奉母來游，留贈十字，「足山並足水」一宜盥也宜詩，」那是最新的題墨咧。」其時老友汪子典存，偕夫人袁世莊忽至，不期而遇，喜可知了。相與憑窗遥矚？見山間楓樹，半已釀紅，彷彿酒後微嚑，饒有詩意。典存道；「再隔十日，那山楓經霜盡赤，萬丈紅霞，不更蔚爲大觀嗎？」後典存先行，我們也下山，碧樹蔭中，紅牕隱約，便是「白雲古刹，」旁卽「正文祠，」大儒名山，相得益彰，瞻仰久之，令人起敬。我和百康乘輿，回至船邊，餘人步行，毫無倦容。三時下船，再謀果腹，歸途順風，舟行極速，到胥江僅五時許。如此清游，不可無記，便拉雜書此，别爲紀游詩二十八韵，倩　友繪圖以誌一時豪興。</p>

<h3>青平的需要</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>在現代四卷一期裏，有一篇康嗣羣先生的「周作人先生」，裏面有這麽幾句話：</p>
<p>「現在的青年需要的是多的和新的花様，强大的刺激和說誑，故此對於這種沈靜其實淵博的言論和熊度是頗非難的。」</p>
<p>康先生寫作家紀事的態度很是謙卑，他自以爲這篇論文（？）没甚價値，而歸咎於年齡和知識。但對於青年，却似乎也「頗難」，這大概是像他那様的「年齡和知識所能夠辦到」的了。</p>
<p>周作人先生散文的讀者是否都是中年以上的人，「沈靜其實淵博」是否只有中年以上的人才需要，這且不去研究。但做青年確乎太難了，尤其在「現在」。</p>
<p>需要「多的和新的花様」，需要「强大的刺激」，這幾乎是每個年青人的特徵，不一定要「現在」。然而「現在」的青年一有這種需要，便立刻成爲罪案，成爲别人指摘的話柄了。這是甚麽緣故呢？吾欲借漆匠顧洪生的嘴而應之曰：「不知。」</p>
<p>更奇怪的，康先生還以爲青年需要「說誑」；換一句話說，便是青年需要别人說假話來欺騙自己。據我所知，青年被騙是有的。至於說這是他們自己的需要，未免近於誣衊。</p>
<p>從前科舉的時候，朝廷以八股文鼓勵臣民，父兄以八股文督責子弟，螢窗十年的苦功，把個青年訓練成「唯唯喏喏」的順民了。這是誰的需要，這是誰的成功呢？</p>
<p>何况晚近的前輩先生，也正有許多人，拿新的對象來代替紅藍頂子，作爲引誘欺騙的工具，把青年一個個捉入囊中，敎他們高呼；利用過了，便任意玩弄，譏笑，挖苦。</p>
<p>也還有不顧時代的需要，把青年造成和自己一様的人物，動之以甘言，誘之以厚利，於是歐化者歐化，國化者國化。等自己被捧上雲端，便把脚下的青年一個個踏死。然後得意洋洋的說：「這是青年自己的需要。」</p>
<p>青年康嗣羣先生也曰：「那是青年自己的需要。」</p>
<p>嗚呼，世安得有需要「說誑」之青年，而爲余一道其究竟！</p>
<h3>掛孩子</h3>
<p>— 盛煥明</p>
<p>母親來信說：「……昨晨有人在我家門前掛一男孩，襤褸可憐，但我家外强中乾，如何養得起，今天已託阿狗把他送到育嬰堂去，回念汝十齡時，亦曾有同様事，雖亦未納，但昔盛今衰，能不感慨係之……」接着她告訴我近年來掛孩子的事情是如何的多；因爲差不多的人家都不大容易撫養得起孩子了。</p>
<p>我記起十年前掛孩子的那回事了：那孩子給擺在一個半花白的菜籃子裏在一個夜裏掛在我家的腰門上，小鼻子朝天，臉紅紅的，是個誕生不多天的男孩。靜靜地睡在棉絮堆中；身上蓋着條土布圍裙，還擺了十個紅雞蛋。早上被人發見時，他給談話聲篤覺了，惺忪地睜睜眼，像要打噴嚔似的吸了兩口氣，然後呱哇呱呀地哭起來。</p>
<p>「啊丨好大的哭聲丨丨好一個孩子！」母親就想留下來。</p>
<p>可是祖父很憎惡，他銜着旱烟嘴喃喃地駡着：「無恥……一定是那一個「爛貨」的私生子，風水倒敗……」</p>
<p>這些話就是表示他的反對（可是無論如何不會直接說出來的。）母親只得私下呌個人拿了三塊錢和孩子一塊兒送到城裏的育嬰堂裏去。</p>
<p>天冷了，母親掛念起那個嬰兒來，偷倫地把我小時穿的一件花白棉襖送到育嬰堂，預備給那孩子多穿上點。</p>
<p>「早就給他自己的父母領回去了，Ｘ師母。一育嬰堂裏的沈敎士說。</p>
<p>母親爲了這件事心裏歉疚了好多天。</p>
<p>後來·那個「快嘴婆娘」玉桂嫂說：「嬸嬸，我打聽到了，這是「高坂」貴生家的，做夢不做夢，人心不知足，家裏過得去，還要掛孩子到人家來，要想孩子大起來托你們的福讀點書咧丨丨自己「快活」出來的孩子要想人家養；要想人家給他讀當丨丨做夢不做夢，嘖嘖！人心眞眞不知足」……</p>
<p>那孩子現在已長成個「肯做」的小夥子了。每提到這件事時，母親總感慨到一個人的命運上去，並且悔當年不把他留下來：「眞不幸，如果把他留下來，現在不知道是怎様的一個人了！」說這話時，她的眼睛興奮地閃皪着。</p>
<p>然而，這次她竟又不能容下這個濫褸的嬰兒。</p>
<p>母親的感慨是有道理的。</p>
<h3>鄉居隨筆自序</h3>
<p>— 陳醉雲</p>
<p>一九三○年夏季，我遭了一次大病，雖然樓對公園，但門前車聲日夜喧闐，這使我對於都市非常憎厭。病稍愈，覺得非遷居不可。因了某種便利，遂急急離開上海，遷往嘉興濮院療養。起先的計劃，祇打算在濮院住一二個月，等身體較好，再移居杭州鄉間。但濮院給我的印象，似乎還不壞：那時病體旣未蘇復·行動勢所不能，便每天躺在一間小樓中，把窗門敞開着，瞧那窗外的樹枝和天空，以及從天空掠過的飛鳥。清曉睡醒，日午晝永，在那閒寂的庭院中，嗚蟬每曳長音，裊娜入窗，清越可聽。而鄰家姊妹，聚集樓下，偶作笑語，雖不見人，亦殊可親。至於後院牆外，負販經過巷底，卽使喊着「油條」與「扁豆糕，」但其聲自遠而近，或自近而遠。也覺悠揚可愛，無礙寧靜。旣無煤灰入窗。也無車聲閙人，躁意悉除，倍覺心澄境淨。而一至日落天昏，尤爲安謐，長夜靜寂，更宜睡酣。病旣大愈，雖曾一度去滬，但不久仍返濮院，不覺一住年餘。在此停留期中，於工作之餘，也曾偶作雜記，卽題其名爲「鄉居隨筆，」時作時輟，得三十餘則。</p>
<p>一九三二年歳首，我們又遷往吳興烏鎭，愛鄉居之寧靜，一住又將兩年。其間也曾續寫「鄉居隨筆，」除散失一部分外，得五十餘則。但烏鎭濮院，都係水鄉，平原坦坦，全境無山，久居漸起平淡之感；而「沃土之民，」習於苟惰，四野旣多浮棺殯舍，不免觸目生憎；江河中又隨便傾倒穢物，飲水尤爲惡濁。并且我是在山鄉生長的人，愛山鄉甚於水鄉，因此又起遷居之念，擬於一九三四年，載書橐筆，移向杭州鄉間。其地有天目山的餘脈蜿蜒入境，而清澈苕溪，亦沿山麓東流。我卽擬家於此間，過半耕半讀的生活。</p>
<p>記得在二十歳左右時，我爲了追隨「時髦」之故，曾經戴過腰圓的金絲脚眼鏡，以及正圓的玳瑁邊眼鏡，致眼角與鼻梁上隱隱和痛，雖然本來毫無眼病，并且爲了追隨「時髮」，也曾著過尖頭的　鞋，與狹阍的皮靴，幾幾乎等於削足就屨，使足部感受非必要的苦楚。這雖然不至成爲不可恕的行爲，但畢竟是愚昧而滑稽的，并且也正是受了「時髦」的欺騙與戲弄。這些，自然還算小事。至於其他流俗，文字，思想，披上了「時髦」的外衣，所明示或暗示於我們的騙局，也　不少呢，究竟能有若　　得住眞理！如今我已是二十多歳的人人，雖不敢說意志漸次堅定，但這一類把戲，到底也有點看穿了，所以我很愛走我自己的道路，不願再爲了盲從「時髦」而有所猶豫。可是對於「認爲切要的迎　學上去」這個志願，却也不敢懈怠。在這動盡多變的時代，我虽雖住向鄉間，不過距「朝」「市」略遠而已，並未與世脫離，或者因了沉機處默，更可以給我深切的注意，也未可知，這也是我所不敢自菲的。</p>
<p>我旣愛走我自己的道路，現在，離開水鄉而往山鄉的日期，也漸次迫近了。在這水鄉三年多的停留，雖無所得，却也不願緘默以息，因把這些「鄉居隨律，」輯集成書，藉作紀念。這些隨筆，情調頗不一致：大概在心境怡悅時候，則多愉快之音，因而歌咏自然，禮贊田園；在接觸缺憾時候，則多指摘之言，因而批評社會，諷資制度。主觀客觀。固難劃分；名爲隨筆，亦卽紀實。我祗把所見，所聞所感，所慮，呈獻給閱者，若說「立言」，那却是不敢當的</p>
<h3>談湯爲犧牲</h3>
<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>古史相傳，湯自伐桀後，大旱七年。殷吏卜曰，當以人禱。湯曰，吾所爲請雨者民也，若必以人禱，吾請自當。遂齋戒，翦髮斷爪，以已爲犧牲，禱於桑林之社。古代社會刑人以祭，見於載記者，莫名於湯爲犧牲一事。章太災先生謂「湯爲犧牲，」犧牲乃義旌之誤，殆未必然。蓋草昧社會，崇信人神雜糅，人而食人，鬼神同嗜，食人與人祭，因同時存在者也。時至晚近，古道僅存。滿清政府嘗釁徐錫麟以祭恩銘，洪憲皇帝時亦嘗釁王連生以祭鄭汝成，猶存人祭之遺意。</p>
<p>，自殷虛卜辭發見，殷代之社會眞相斷明，則不能不感謝於王國維郭沬若二三學者研究之成果。頃有徐吉軒先生著殷契通釋一書。其於殷代社會之分析，頗覺犁然當理。至謂殷代爲食人時期，亦頗有據。蓋山海經有王亥食人之辭。韓子有紂囚文王，翼侯炙，鬼侯臘，比干剖心，梅侯醢語。。又周書亦言商紂暴虐，脯鬼侯以享諸侯。古史難詳，有此亦可證殷代食人之風也。</p>
<p>徐氏疑殷爲石器時代，未脫部落社會。彼曾發現卜辭强半爲方名平列之辭。何謂方？殷人稱部落爲方，猶周之所謂國，如爾萬方有罪是。何謂方名？殷代部落，必有一圖成一字爲其標職，此種標識，即方名也，如鬼方徐方等是。旋發現祭辭祖名上下悉爲方名，於是始知殷用各方人爲祭。當未祭前，先决於卜。所有方名平列之卜辭，均爲此類。殷在未組織王朝以前，亦爲部落之一，其標識爲唐。唐古文啺，湯爲啺譌變也。卜辭祭辭廟號有三：一爲契，爲唐荒古傳說之祖：一爲王亥，爲唐擴大部落之祖；一爲太乙，史記作王乙，爲唐組織王朝之祖。後人不知有唐，竟以湯稱之又依成周例，稱爲成湯，（齊侯鎛文曰成唐）經史誤以爲太乙之名。由徐氏之說，湯應作唐，「湯爲犧牲」之說，當有其事。因殷代社會，食人與人祭之風同時存在，有卜辭爲證。成湯獨不願以人祭，乃以己爲犧牲；又不願即死，故但翦髮斷爪以示意也。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（二十八）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>當哲把斟得滿滿的兩杯酒遞給兩個女太太時，博齊汝船長便和羅蘭老爹碰着杯。</p>
<p>陸太太不肯飲酒，和她那死去的丈夫相熟的博齊汝船長便呌道：</p>
<p>「喝啦，喝啦，陸太太，我們的土話說得好bisrepetita　placent,這意思卽是：「丙杯威爾母酒决不會有什麽壞處。」我呢你看，自從我退職以來，我便每天這様，晚飯前我喝點兒酒，使自己覺得船向左右摇了幾下！飯畢喝過咖啡，我又喝點兒，使自己覺得船向前後摇了幾下，這様我晚上便會覺得航行在有風浪的海上。但我决不至於使自己覺得航行在暴風雨的海上，决不，决不，因爲我害怕災難呢。」</p>
<p>這老航海家的話投合了羅蘭老父的航海癖，他滿心高興的笑着，面孔紅紅的，眼睛也因飲了茴香酒的緣故有點昏花了。他有着那些小店老闆所常有的大肚子，祗有一個肚子，好像他身上其餘各部分都隱遁在這肚子裏似的，這是那些老是坐着的人們的有的那種柔軟的肚子，他們旣没有腿，也没有胸，也没有臂，也没有頸，他們的椅子底下坐的那塊地方常是被他們壓得稀爛。</p>
<p>博齊汝却和他相反，雖也短而肥，但像一隻鷄蛋一様圓滿，一顆彈子一様堅硬。</p>
<p>羅蘭夫人還没有把她的第一杯酒喝光，已被幸福陶醉了，臉上紅艷艷的，眼色晶瑩，她凝視着她的兒子哲安。</p>
<p>哲安現在也是喜氣洋洋的。這是一件已經成功的事情，他每年有兩萬佛郎收入了。在他的笑容，比較洪亮的語聲，看人的眼色，和他那比較磊落的舉止，大方的態度上，我們可以感覺到金錢的力量。</p>
<p>晚餐備好了，當羅蘭老爹把手臂伸給陸太太邀她到飯廳去時，他的女人呌道：「不，不，爹爹，今天什麽都要讓哲安做主人。」</p>
<p>飯桌上陳設得異常華麗；哲安坐在他父親常坐的主位上，在他的食碟前面，一大紥綢花，一紥講究席面用的綢花像一座結着彩的圓形屋頂一様高高聳立着。旁邊擺着四個果碟，一碟裡面堆着許多大桃子，第二碟盛着一個大點心，裏面塡滿着拌透了的乳酷，面上蓋着一層糖做的小鈴，一座餅乾做的天主敎堂，第三碟是許多切成薄片的鳳梨浸在透明的糖汁裏，第四碟更是華麗到了極點，一碟從暖熱的國度來的黑葡萄。</p>
<p>「阿呀！」筆爾一面就座一面說，「我們在慶祝富豪哲安的降臨啦。」</p>

<h3>紗花標紗輕輕上漲</h3>
<p>紗市趨堅、以擯持已久、近月被維持而穩定、交易大减、而一般散戶稍有抵補、市盤前遂升、但實需依然沉寂、綫價因貨缺而堅挺、就大衆意料、紗市仍不脫盤旋之局、</p>
<h3>標紗散多略有補進</h3>
<p>人標前市開盤、以場中賣戶缺乏、市氣轉緊、近漲八角至一元二角、遠期漲五角、午後形勢仍堅、各月又漲二三角、全日成交統計一萬三千八百包、查賣出大豐三百五十包、同孚八百包、製昌四百包、大昶七百包、長豐三百五十包、愼記三百五十包、買進備昌九百包、椿記四百包、通記六百五十包、達記六百五十包、仁豐一百四百包、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>標花似在靜止狀態中　▲籌碼不暢…投機束手▲</h3>
<p>棉市平淡、形勢尙堅、以塲中籌碼不暢、一般投機者皆束手停頓、故交易日見减縮、惟美棉平疲、匯兌步升、採換價日趨下降、就大勢而輪、當有趨跌之慮、市上現棉交易頗清、廠胃甚滯、美棉現貨合銀盤破進四十一元關矣、</p>
<h3>鄭標大體平穩</h3>

<h3>上週印棉未隨美棉上漲</h3>
<p>上週市價因滙兌關係、未隨美棉上漲、政府報告發表後、美棉雖昂、但因多頭了結及缺乏重要問訊之故、仍形平和、目前投機家均在等候日印商歸之决定、現銷進步、日本及遠東運輸商均有成交、中國及歐洲亦有進展、本地廠商雖有大批售出之希望、然現貨問訊、依然失望、天氣良好、採收順利、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<h3>糧食　粉走北路後市面帶緊</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、　初平　消之明、以洋麥無報價、故初開時、人心平平、旋因客帮雖無大批交易、惟因各廠存底、自營口天津暢後、漸感枯乏、所以市場人心、逐步穩固、兼之一部分之浮空、因市面帶緊、洋麥尙未裝到之時、不免心虛、故亦步步爭　、致近遠各期、均見步昂、照目下情形、當看封河汎之實銷、如無接續、市面當然仍看堅勢也、至天津現貨、無甚變動、約在二元三角至三角二分之間、廠方大廠未動、小廠略出、結果本月份至一月份較前週均好二分、二月份好一分半、三月份好一分七厘半、四月份好一分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>本麥已屆落令　丨洋粉起而代之丨</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、均見一致俏利之象、以洋麥雖無報價、惟國内之小麥、目下已經落令、雖各地存貨尙有、裝申者則已减少、兼之日來粉銷一活、市場人心、當然爲之帶振、故各盤中買戶頗盛、市價逐步上躍、惟將來洋麥進口、終不能免故漲勢尙不甚巨也、結果本月漲四分、十二月份漲六分、一二月份漲五分、三月份漲四分、現麥市面亦趨堅俏、廠胃尚佳、開山東麥四元一角、清江麥四元、　灣麥四元另八分、揚州麥三元九角、次八角半、姜堰麥三元九角九分、浦東麥三元六角、次五角六分、高郵麥三元九角八份、由阜豐去一千四百包、　新去二千五百包、申大去三百包云、</p>
<h3>厚粳提高近尺</h3>
<p>（滬南）來源三十餘號、貨共四五千石、中以各帮晚稻居半、常帮蘇同等粳及南港等厚稻則占少數、故雖前日午市呈軟象、昨則幸貨到　、未受影響、市况反有起色、故常帮蘇　等粳及南港等厚稻行情提高數分至角許、至於青角西　等晚稻、來貨雖占半數、包胃亦復相等、因而形勢未受牽制、目售方尙有增高之意、惟客家懷抱以客市難强、吃盤未能放鬆、致雙方遂處相背地位、因之相持不下、直至午後尙未開出、是以晚稻市况無從考實、杜羊尖店胃頗合、升色近尺、隂元續秀、變元無榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）各路到貨五十號、市銷呆滯、新粳·羊杜埠客秈·早稻·浦稻·隂元均屢平疲、白元酒戶拾巧略化、零拆尙佳、價形挺立、</p>
<h3>客秈本客俱有動辦　▲江西米到頭漸旺</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、轉形活潑、車輪貨均有抵埠、江西機晚米出新後到頭不多、前昨兩日間來源漸旺、此後亦有逐次活潑之象、市上存到兩多、市面本看平軟、惟昨日本街均屬囤戶胃口、客帮閩粤均活、廣帮多時未辦、昨日成交涉市糙米二千多包、本街囤戶去京廠秈及陳機晚一千三百五十七包、閩省以泉州較多、計辦去江西新晚一百四十包、湖南米九百五十包、江北米五百包、京車秈三百十包、無錫秈二百廿包、沙市糙米一千多包、全日成交各米六千五百包左右、價比上週末較大一二角不等、</p>
<h3>南北貨頂莊菜再漲一元</h3>
<p>金針菜近以行號存底均薄、市價日緊、兼之廣東福建等帮、銷胃頗佳、故市勢又升、如　莊菜開至二十元、比前盤再漲一元、廣帮昨又去二百餘包、别帮亦有交易、趨勢緊秀、</p>
<h3>糖市　潮青産地缺貨</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、以各帮走塲久無起色、疲軟難振、公會劃盤、一四粗砂白普通貨、初呌二十元五角、後四角半、有貨亦未劃出、二十號中砂白呌二十元、八九號荷赤普通十五元九角、太古糖Ｂ嘜二十元九角、中華一號綿白呌價又小五分、爲十九元二角半、均乏成交、國産青糖、如銷胃轉動、市勢有復振之象、因碗青有某號去電、地頭問價、據復無貨、且申存僅二千餘包、故國産潮青、不致過小、且有後望、在新陳不接之際、更有回振可能、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油微漲生油不動</h3>
<p>豆油市徘徊已久、實因連電無變化、客銷忽斷忽續、來源不湧、市價漲落甚微、昨日成交各油六百餘件、價盤略升角許、花生油依然固守原盤、因去路尚　到存亦不　、所以市况、暫少變遷耳、</p>
<h3>五金黑頁鐵現貨軋缺</h3>
<p>二尺六尺十八張黑鐵皮　新近北路天津烟台青島諸帮均有收辦、故成交頗夥、惟來貨不多、故市貨十分軋缺、標準每百斤（磅秤估十一元七角半、比前已覺挺勃多多矣、但本街搪磁廠生意、目下亦在發展之時、所以均有吸收心思、但以有限之存底、供鉅景之去路、所以行情一節、大有看好之可能、</p>
<p>五金市塲雖有改用市秤之說、但章程尙未頒佈、各同業實際買賣、仍沿用磅秤（卽天平秤）之重量計算云、</p>
<h3>絲茶祁紅無市平水無貨　土莊綠茶歐銷略動</h3>
<p>昨日土莊珍眉針眉蝦目等綠茶、同孚天祥永興復昌等行、又復開辦、全市共計成交四百七十餘箱、蝦目售盤七十二元、珍眉售盤自四十八元至六十七元、較前無甚上落、惟針眉秀眉等項、市價約跌一二元、至路莊平水綠茶、因存底均告枯薄、合銷之茶、已感無貨應市、祁門紅茶、亦均無人問及云、</p>

<h3>「國術」批判</h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>大體說來，我們這民族在許多方面是「不學有術」的。「蕭老師」的焚布療疾，是一種「術」；六十三代張天師扛着令牌寳劍到大世界替人畫符消災，也是一種「術」；班禪（一作「國師」）的唸經祈禱，又是一種「術」；推之如許多國醫們的「口代祖傳」，也無非是「術」。上列各種，除了國醫們的「術」有許多是不可否認之行之有效的「經騐」而外，其他諸行業的「術」，就是偶然碰着的效騐，也是非常之少；戳穿了說，不過屬於一　「是知其不可而爲之」的「生活方式」而已。大凡「術」的來源，多半是由於肉口傳，秘傳，祖傳，祖傳或「異人傳授」而書本的傳授，却比較少，並且一切傳「術」的書，都是以觀念論或玄想爲骨髓，未經科學的鍜鍊：就中的醫術，雖是偶然能發生「意想不到之效力」，但終於說不出所以然。這就是凡百「不學有術」的事態的根本特徵。</p>
<p>在中國，一九三三年不但是所謂「國貨年」，而且從事實上觀察，也大可謂之爲「術年」。以術干祿的班禪，旣已是法號别墅，都有着落：張天師賣符的收入，據說也還不菲。何况蔚爲盛典，「獨向繁榮」的還有新近「開科取英雄」的「國術」！</p>
<p>「國術」在中國的流傳，有很悠久的歷史。這玩意兒在火藥和一切現代的武器還没有發明，戰爭的方式只限於「掄刀跨馬，大戰一百回合」的中世紀時代，自然在國防上佔很大的比重。可是，自從「洋大人」的「上帝福音」和各種戰艦機關槍斬關奪鎖而入之後，「國術」的重要性，就無疑地要降低到標凖以下。我並不否認，事實上有若干受過「名師指教」的有名或無名之士，經過了十年八年的勤修苦鍊，可以跳蹤得比這次「打破全國紀錄」的符保盧更爲敏捷高遠一些，可以成爲一個「汽車過身」的大力士，可以用一根木棒抵抗十幾個人的械鬥。然而對於這種「戞戞獨造」的「國術」，却必須加以兩點最重要的認識，即：一，這種僅見的「好漢」，自始至今，只限於國民中的絶對少數；二，這種絶技，無論如何，擋不了來路貨的毒瓦斯或「達姆達姆彈」。所以，站在時代的現階段來估量「國術」，牠至多不過是：</p>
<p>就少數以「國術」爲終身嗜好或事業的人而言，充其量可以造成幾個隊了槍砲炸彈而外，許多人都不是敵手的「英雄」。這種人物，可以在某種制度下充軍事學校的體育敎練，可以在各同樂會塲作「萬人咋舌」的表演，個人趕夜路時，可以抵當幾個「打悶棍」的剪徑强人（要是遇到拿着手槍「剥豬玀」的「朋友」，就大成問題）；等而下之，就只有充當闊公要人們的衛士或護院領班了。（說得「缺德」一些，就是「人　」！）</p>
<p>就一般的人或青年而言，練習拳脚（以不使用蠻氣力的爲限），充其量不過可以當作茶餘飯後或早操晚操時之一種舒經活血的運動；要是有效，可以帮助人們多吃一碗飯；無效，也不會弄得人頭痛發燒。反正學「太極拳」要比搓「五百　」來得有意義一些。</p>
<p>但是，如杲對於「國術」超過了以上的估價而加以想入非非的誇張，說提倡「國術」就是正所以「反抗帝國主義」或主張「國術救國」，那就恰有類於「阿Ｑ同志」之「參加辛亥革命」丨「白盔白甲」，「手執鋼鞭將你打」丨</p>
<p>「狸猫換太子」，「七俠五義」的連環圖畫，在中國執行了許多年之「大衆文學」的使命；近年以來，江湖奇俠傳和各種武俠小說都是「有脛而走」；「火燒紅蓮寺」成爲落後羣衆之「精精上的養料」。流毒所披，把一部分小資産階級市民的政治幻想提高到極度，「抗日」有時旣不免於「反動」，只好從自己的耳濡目染的文化氣分中，幻想會有一個「飛行奇俠」來替中國「取帝國主義者之首級於千里之外」！於是，竟有幾批的青年學徒私行出走，爲的是「走遍名山大川，訪求名師異人，學習劍術」！</p>
<p>現在，「江湖奇俠傳」的餘波未息，「武科塲」的「國考」又應運而生。最大的結果，並不在「擂台」上打破的幾十個「英雄」的頭，而是乘機竊發，連篇纍涵陳列於許多書店之玻璃橱中的，不是社會科學，而是哲學，不是敎科書，而是「張三峯鍊丹秘訣」，「打暗器須知」，「鐵布衫眞傳……」。這决不是一個簡單的書賈牟利的問題，而是落後的國民之政治意識的反映！</p>
<p>如果這種闡揚「武化」的「文化運動」再長此發展下去，咱們這民族恐不知又將如何了！</p>

<h3>「象棋與麻雀」</h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>我常常這様同我底朋友：『你會走棋麽？』</p>
<p>『不會。』大多數這様回答。</p>
<p>『會打牌麽？』</p>
<p>『會』十有九個說。</p>
<p>『棋和牌不是同様的消遣品麽？爲什麽你會賭錢的打牌而不會高尚的走琪？』</p>
<p>朋友都不能回答。</p>
<p>這裏給我們一個教訓，那就是人們易於學會不高尙的事，而不易學會高尙的事，換句話說，人性接近於下流。</p>
<p>這裏又要說到題外的事。有一個我小時的敎師這様說：「當我小的時候，先生呌我讀廿四史，讀不上幾段，我就會沉沉欲睡。可是我却喜歡躱在床上看紅樓夢和西廂記，我甚至於能夠看到天明。」</p>
<p>那位先生關於這一段事實的結論的；「這是天性。小孩子會走琪的極少見，而小孩子會賭錢的觸目皆是。」</p>

<h3>棄文習武</h3>
<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>解釋題意，棄文習武没有「投筆從戎」的意思。</p>
<p>我的一位朋友，他和我在大學裏出來之後，在一個很好的機會中放棄了五十元一月的薪金，後來反而在一個資本家的辦公室中以一塊錢一天的代價同時出賣他的腦力和勞力。在當初心中總是那様的不滿意，然而這一點殘羹冷飯他知道再等候下去將要賸一點渣澤了，所以一日二十四小時一月三十日的過去，優游自得的大有此間樂不思蜀了，自然在他們母子兩個，在上海生活中，並不見得比普通一般的好。</p>
<p>最近在秋的「大犧牲」中，他這座捧了三年的金飯碗，被新任買辦的舅爺之類搶了去，換一句話說，他是北方老鄉口中的「鳥兒朗當」了。他家中没有恒産，以前三十元一月的進欵，就是瞧見銀行廣告說積沙可以成山等話。恐怕他是没有什麽沙去堆積這座山的，失業下來，這個一百三十磅體重的身體，不及掛在肉店門口一個猪頭。</p>
<p>我們的友誼比較深一點，住址也很近，於是他每天到我小樓來，雖然我在物質上不能帮助他，或者有什麽路道助他一臂之力；然而兩個意氣相投的「鳥兒朗當」人物碰在一塊，就是嘆幾聲氣，發幾句牢騷，也似乎很夠味兒，而我們一天談天的代價，也僅僅兩包小好樂香烟，和一壺原泡的便宜茶，如其定要仔細的算這筆賬，我不瞞天地再加十文制錢的開水。談得投機時，舗紙舐筆，塗寫稿子向各附刊　　，撈幾文錢來作爲香烟等費用，然而他的長長的一篇失業談終於被　　先生投進了字紙簏。本來在這個年頭兒談失業是太冲白開水了。</p>
<p>那天。我們偶然發現了一個賣牛肉麵的攤頭，幾次交易之後，知道他們這小小的攤頭，每天可做廿千生意，作爲三分利計，每天賺兩塊大洋是穩穩的事，於是這幾天我小樓中談起了這個葉文習武的問題。</p>
<p>化了許多書本錢，從學堂高府中深出頭來，每月三十元的殘羹冷飯，還是你搶我奪，甚於要從什麽脚膀上帶上去。現在以這個賣牛肉麵的攤頭作個例，只要備一二十元的資本，知道一些關於牛肉的常識，像以何處出售爲便宜及如何煑法等等，加一個三分利或四分利，就可以懸一牌紙板，寫着牛肉麵每碗二百文，牛肉湯每碗一百二十文，這種輕而易舉的生意，每天可照兩塊大洋的牌頭，我們總算讀了不少書，智識階級反不及一個設牛肉麵攤的藍布短衫朋友，所以我們討論的結束，不如棄文習武。</p>
<p>棄文者脫去長袍短褂丨西裝亦在此例一習武者，換上藍布短衫褲之謂也。</p>
<p>因爲感到没有冷飯搶，憤怒之餘，我們好像一定這様做去；然而直到今天爲止，我們兩位「鳥兒朗當」的朋友，還是拖着一襲破舊的棉袍想在報上找一個招請書記之類的職業。棄文習武像口號一般在「餓死事小，失節事大」的自以爲智識階級中是没有效力的，我自己還在呼小好樂喝原泡的便宜茶啊！（道不是享樂，得特别聲明）</p>
<p>嗚呼！智識階級丨嗚呼！長衫同志！</p>

<h3>摹仿</h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>猴子在動物界中是最會摹仿的，但是牠有一個很大的缺點，那就是，牠不管已所摹仿的是否壞的，或是好的，一味盲目的摹仿。光漢君在他「創造，摹仿，享受」一文中，說中國人祗會「享受」的，這句話有點過於武斷，我覺得中國人「摹仿」有點和猴子相像，人云我亦云地「瞎摹仿」，毫不分清他人的舉動，是有害的，還是有益的，總之，祇要牠是「新式」的「摹登」的，中國人就會熱烈的去摹仿。</p>
<p>「摹仿」這東西，本來不是一種什麽有害的事情，比如日本吧，她在五十年前，不是一個和現在的中國一様貧弱的國家麽？但是她靠了會「摹仿」的本領，五十年後的今日，竟能夠吞并我們老大的中國了！可是道「摹仿」搬到中國，我們貴國仍是那老様子呢？甚至幾個鄉下佬竟說一年不如一年了！這是什麽緣故呢？在這裏，我們應該把中國人的「瞎摹仿」一認清一下。你不看見麽？對於西洋的科學，那一個肯「迎頭趕上去」摹仿，但是在上海，連江北大姐亦知道，男女同走路是要挽手的呵！</p>
<p>並且，中國人「瞎摹仿」外，還要將所摹仿的原意誤解，連好的事情，一被中國人摹仿，亦變成壞的了。比如吧，「自由戀愛」在西洋的本意無非是，使男女多得點相互因此而漸次可了解的機會，以便將來結婚後，不至有隔膜有事情。但是這「自由戀愛」，一旦乘了輪船，從老遠的西洋輸入中國，就成爲青年年們玩弄女性的口實了。</p>
<p>諸如此的事情，是舉不勝舉的，但是讓過去爲過去了吧！我希望從今天起丨不要又是明天了，丨我們應該積力地摹仿人家的好的文化呵！因爲我們要知道，在積極的摹仿中，漸漸地能夠養成「創造的力量」呀！</p>
<p>國人們，起來吧！起來「迎頭趕上去」摹仿我國所缺乏的科學吧！</p>

<h3>光榮</h3>
<p>— 克洛</p>
<p>近日來，老馬更加努力了！你看他整日間在操塲裏繞着圓圈子跑，跑，跑，跑得多起勁呀！好像他生到世上就是專爲着跑呀！</p>
<p>朋友見到他，總要拍一下他的肩膀，伸出一個大姆指來在他面前一晃，帶笑的說：</p>
<p>『老馬！努力呀！將來在全會裏能得到錦標，不特是你個人的光榮，而且是我們全校……而且是我們全省的光榮呀！……』</p>
<p>敎育之今日</p>
<p>老馬於是更起勁了，跑起來的時候，就彷彿聽到了這幾句話在耳朶裏嗡嗡作響，並且那『光榮』二字，立刻變爲當頭的太陽，是如何的光明燦爛呀，以致他昏眩得幾乎睜不開眼睛來！</p>
<p>『這次我到底能不能得到錦標呢？……</p>
<p>有時他對自己懷疑起來，覺得自己跑得還有點不成，這次恐怕要失敗吧？可是，突然想起了『最後的勝利，必歸於最後之努力者』那兩句話時，這種疑慮立刻消失了；因爲他始終是努着力的，這，他相信。那末最後的勝利，還能由自己手掌中飛去麽？</p>
<p>於是，整個的心，完全爲『光榮』佔領了！現在世界上一切事他都毫不關心，不用說，連看報紙的功夫都莫有了，就是有點功夫，也不過靜躺在床上，幻想着得錦標時的情景；那成千成萬的人頭的攢動，那如雷吼一般的鼓掌聲，那輝煌燦爛的奬品，那……</p>
<p>『唔！……』他突然用拳頭在床上重重的打了一下，鼻子眼睛都在笑！</p>
<p>開會的日子快要到了，各地的選手一批一批的由不同的地方出發赴會，車站上受了朋友和愛人熱烈的歡送與鼓勵，更使他激奮起來，當臨别的刹那間，大有『風瀟瀟兮易水寒，壯士一去兮，不復還！』那種悲壯的意味！</p>
<p>功豈有枉用的，開會的結果，老馬果然得到錦標了，當領奬的那一天，他簡直歡喜得好像駕在雲頭上一様，脚底下都有點飄飄然！聽到諸位大人先生們那些贊揚和鼓勵的話，都一句一句的打在他的心坎上，於是他竭力咬着嘴唇，心裏在微笑，同時又想到：『照這様，我情願當一輩子選手呢！』</p>
<p>嚇丨奬品領下來了，雙手捧着那些輝煌燦爛的東西，誠心誠意的向那位全國最高貴的人一鞠躬，『行這禮多簡單呀，就是跪下去也是値得的……』這一個念頭又由老馬的腦中瞥過。</p>
<p>無數嫉妬的，羡慕的眼光，都投射到他的身上，他昏了，這纔眞正光榮呀　　就在這光榮的期待及其獲得的過程中，全世界的風雲已不知起過多少變化了！</p>

<h3>童年斷片的回憶（四）</h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>那正是重陽節。</p>
<p>天氣雖然還很温暖，可是殺風景的西北風，却已吼吼地刮了一身了，這時野外底景色，在我那時看來，彷彿尋不出什麽意味，只是覺得没有像春天的般好玩，處處都呈露着蕭瑟冷落，雁羣在天際外點綴着高高的蒼穹。</p>
<p>（四）列火</p>
<p>剛剛忙着吃了芋頭，圳上李宗儒大摇大擺地跨進來了，說是邀大哥往猴子山去登高，他瞧着我還啣有一個芋頭在口裏嚼，便正經地擺出臉孔說：</p>
<p>「芋頭是滯氣的東西，不可多吃！」話還没有說到夠量的程度，便又轉了臉對着我的媽媽：</p>
<p>「大娘，芋頭不是好東西，孩子不宜許他多吃吓！」轉臉再向我說：</p>
<p>「儔弟，芋頭吃夠了，今天是重陽節，跟我們去登高吧，你大哥也去！」講到大哥，我便有些火冒，晚上爸爸要我在他面前唸點生書，預備明日易於唸熟，他總有些不願意，似乎很不耐煩，一遍敎不上口，他便連書帶人摔在一邊，走進寢室裏去了，因之我便以後不要他敎了，寗願在先生前挨駡。</p>
<p>「不去，我另有事去！」我忖度了一回說：</p>
<p>恰巧，間壁的五姊端着一大盌芋頭帶吃帶走地來了，我便趁機向她提議：</p>
<p>「五姊，大前天刮大風，前天刮大風，昨天又刮大風，山上的松毛（註四）許已刮上了尺許厚，我們去簏松毛去吧！反正找不出好的玩意兒來幹！</p>
<p>「是的，阿貴底娘怕我們知了風，一聲不嚮地呌阿貴簏了一天，堆滿了柴屋一角，適才我親眼看到的！」</p>
<p>「再不去，會給他一人簏光了，張家山的！」五姊繼續補充她底意見。</p>
<p>「那末，你快點吃吧！我先去把簍子扒弓預備好！」我翻身便往柴屋裏跑，五姊也轉身走回去了，同時候。</p>
<p>事實確有些希奇，自從易妹珊妹先後佔據了媽媽底懷抱後，那時我剛滿七歳，便格外的與王四媽底第五個小女要好，雖然與其他紀彷彿的男的女的，有些也感情不壞，但究竟比不上與五姊的來得濃厚，因此我倆常在一處，無論玩，或者共同做些不甚重大的小事情，如簍柴，買油沽酒一類的小事，媽媽是常時照顧我倆，指使我倆去幹的，我倆也頗樂意去幹。</p>
<p>爲了不高興合大哥去登高，所以向五姊提議簏柴，五姊居然附議，媽媽聽了笑着說好，事情便如此决定了。</p>

<h3>中國電影藝人訪問記　二十二（續昨）</h3>
<p>— 沙基</p>
<p>（九）「豐年」導演李萍倩（下）</p>
<p>「還有，最近我感覺到，無論任何方面，都需要力的表現。力是生存的方法。所以我想在力的方面做一部片子。力不是單純的。任何方面，祇有力才能動一切。片子中有了力的灌輸，才能永遠的存在。</p>
<p>「不多說了。我談話没有組織，也没有預備。其中一定有錯誤的地方，可是我不會說話」　　一口氣說了這麽一大篇　，確是不易，這决不是不會說話的人能夠說出來的。小鬍子導演未免太客氣吧？這時我放下筆柱，揉一揉手指，立刻想到做私人秘書眞頗不易。</p>
<p>「說完了？」我說：「那末我再問你，你對於批評方面，特别是申報，有什麽意見？」</p>
<p>「不消說，中國電影的轉變，固然是大部份的工作人員有了新的認識，可是批評家也居功不少。批評家使我們認清了道路。關於這一點，我不想單獨的對某一報紙來說，一般的，批評家應當嚴酷公正，但也應當慢慢的引導，不能苛求，譬如說批評家好像是一個保姆，對於一個發育不全，未成熟的小孩兒，應當是指示，誘導。小孩兒剛剛會走的時候，你要他跑是不可能的。」</p>
<p>「那末你認爲那一部電影是你的代表作？」我問。</p>
<p>「這很難說，也可以說對於自自己的作品都不滿意。有些作品是很糟的，但那多半是爲了生活。」</p>
<p>「你的年齡籍貫，從實道來。」</p>
<p>「原籍安徽桐城，生於杭州，今年三十二歳。讀過滬江大學，因經濟，未畢業。」</p>
<p>「日常生活狀况，可得聞乎？」</p>
<p>「我的工作時間很長，因體力關係，工作之外卽休息。我很愛好文藝。以前對於舊的時詞也很有興趣。現在我總在工作中得着安慰。工作的成績，便是我的安慰。」</p>
<p>「你除了導演電影之外，也還從事寫作嗎？」</p>
<p>「以前寫些小品文字，但從事電影之後，便不作了。」</p>
<p>問答完畢，預備收塲，偏生蔡叔聲和「怪物」沈西苓走過來，而且「怪物」還插上嘴說：</p>
<p>「哦，老兄，你不會訪問，你爲什麽不打聽他的羅曼斯呢？」</p>
<p>「我没有羅曼斯。」小鬍子說。</p>
<p>「那末你和××呢？不是嗎？」</p>
<p>「那這種事誰都有的。」</p>
<p>「那末好了，寫下去。」可是蔡公叔聲却來了一句上海話：</p>
<p>「不，不，不，太「惡形惡狀」了。不過你爲什麽要留小鬍子呢？這倒是可以問問的。」</p>
<p>「這個麽？因爲偶然的留長來了，現在也就懶得剃去。何况人也到了留鬍鬚的年齡了。」</p>
<p>「那末你爲什麽呌做李萍倩呢。」又是「怪物」的怪口氣。</p>
<p>「這我可以回答你。我本來呌做青萍，因爲從小兒便死了父母，自己好像是浮萍似的。後來又改爲萍倩，由於這個名字，可是看出我是一個傷感的人。至於什麽姓李，却是没有方法解釋的。」（九）（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「鐵血情瀾」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>丨丨中央映丨丨</p>
<p>關於這一影片，我本來祇想原則的指出幾點。不過爲了使批評和作品更密切的關係，使批評文字更具體化一點，所以盡可能的將好壞兩方面指出幾點。先就好的方面說起。</p>
<p>一，在本質上到底是反帝的作品，在一九三二年的當時，我們的作者，就大胆的表現出反帝的熱情，這是我們認　錢雪凡君並没有完全抺殺現實，雖然他没有正確的體認反帝的意義。</p>
<p>二，攝影算是很好，在機械並不完備的條件之下，能有如此清楚的鏡頭，的確是煞費苦心。</p>
<p>三，鏡頭的變換，也還合理。由於導演之善於取景，如袁叢美在水中被撈救上岸的時候，以及釣魚的那一塲，都抓住了大自然的美點。其他好些外景，也很美麗。</p>
<p>四，胡萍和袁叢美的表演，都將就的過得去，特别是在逃難的時候，胡萍很賣力，不過在醫院中的塲面，却見幼稚了。</p>
<p>五，佈景者也還努力。</p>
<p>大概祇有這幾點了，也許還有遺漏，不過慚愧得很，現在眞記不起來。現在要說到壞的方面了。</p>
<p>一，我們當首行說到的便是這神話似的故事。說是中國還有一個荒島，島上還有一個女王。這種荒誕無稽的傳奇，在目前應受到極嚴酷的打擊。作者所以要幻想出這一荒島，其用意無非是要使故事有波拆，所謂情節離奇。然而這始終是非常可笑，非常幼稚的。</p>
<p>二，有了這様不通的故事，已經使人不快，何况再來兩場打出手。兩個少爺能有萬夫不當之勇，簡直使我們疑惑那女皇的「　兒」們都是豆腐做的。而且前後兩塲都是同様的方式，如兩位少爺乘人不備，自後面，猛撲敵人。於此可知，導演對於全武行也不是拿手好戲。</p>
<p>三，二少爺去荒島的時候，我們看到是划船去的，可是出兵救國的時候，却是渡過一道浮橋，便到了本國，而和敵軍大戰。</p>
<p>四，戰爭的場面，除了新聞片的插入外，都不逼眞，差幸剪接還有可取。</p>
<p>五，我們在先只看到女王有一根舊式的手槍，可是到出兵殺敵的時候，却長槍大刀俱全，不知是那兒來的。至於健兒們的服裝，更是離奇古怪，學像了美國西部影片的服裝，却令中國人都變成美國人了。</p>
<p>但我國人對於這一影片，並不無理由的輕視，爲了和作者諸君作技術上的商榷，所以誠懇的具體指出。至於創作方法的批判，本刊因限於篇幅，很是簡略，可是作者的意識形態也，不是一篇評文可以轉變過來的吧。</p>
<h3>評「絶塞情鴻」</h3>
<p>— 亞夫</p>
<p>The　Devil'sin　Love</p>
<p>丨大光明開映丨</p>
<p>首先我們得　異導演Wilhelm　Dieterle的手法。現在我想就原有程序相當仔細的寫出我的意見。</p>
<p>開頭是法國的殖民地駐軍屠殺當地土民，很短幾個鏡頭便說明了叛民是如何的痛恨駐軍之存在。然後他巧妙的寫出軍醫和上尉的友誼，僅催在軍醫敎上尉拆讀自己的信件，便代暫了一切。寫司令的暴戾，也很簡潔。在一人因畫面上，說明傳令兵假手軍醫暗殺司令的伏線。在後，他不寫司令的死，而只寫軍醫給毒藥司令吃的當時，便令兵的驚恐，接上是軍官會審，那每個人的特寫，眞是太好。高級軍官安閒的揮，除表現出種典型人物固有的神氣之外，更寫到時的天氣。</p>
<p>軍醫的坦白，傳令兵酌極力鎭靜，上尉熱烈的友誼，都恰到好處。當傳令兵假造口供的時候，那種輕聲的平心靜氣，給與我們最深刻的印象，一個配角能有如此成績，可看出外國的電影演員對於技巧的認眞。其後軍醫越獄時，那使人戰慄空氣，也是超越的成積。</p>
<p>其後如軍醫逃往他處，在碼頭上由於小孩兒們向馬鹿討錢，很輕便的寫出土人的貧弱。這中間直到軍醫知道好友上尉卽是馬麗的未婚夫的時候爲此，全是平和的氛圍。更値得特别提出的；當馬麗在花棚中的月夜，看到土人的歌舞，地方色彩固然寫出，而情人們一度接吻之後，軍醫送馬麗回房，看着上尉的像片，雖失望並不道出，只聽得馬麗的一聲「Good　Night」，軍醫頽唐的隱入。接上是收師吹息的油燈，而由他眼中冩到軍醫的收拾行裝。</p>
<p>酒館之女李娜和軍醫的關係，雖然是很少的塲面，然而已經淋漓盡緻，直至軍醫偕馬麗逃往原來的駐軍所在地，乃漸漸的緊張，直到最後的高廟。</p>
<p>軍醫和馬麗騎馬近城堡的時候，先由城上的哨兵驚惶的發現，以爲又是叛兵來了。然後他們在黑暗中隱約的自遠處出現。馬麗和未婚夫擁抱接吻時，上尉的一隻狗直撲在軍醫的身上。這不先以上尉自己發現好友，而藉狗來描寫他們之友誼，直是巧妙之至。</p>
<p>再後，寫軍醫在步哨的槍聲中發現兇犯傳令兵在因瘟疫臥病。於是一方面冩軍醫的巧取傳令兵之口供，同時由槍聲中說明叛民的攻城，並不立刻以畫面表現，讓觀衆顀中注意力在記口供上面。至於這取得傳令兵之口供的方法，也是非常好的，他以電筒照射罪犯的眼睛，再射到司令官的像片上，這種心理學的運用，非常合理，假如　藉兇犯的良心轉變，却容易令人失望了。</p>
<p>口供旣得，兇手一聲槍響，立刻展開叛民攻城的戰爭。其結構之嚴密，使後進的電影作家得着最好的學習。這戰爭的塲面，使我們連想起殷格蘭姆的一枝花」。而整個的地方色彩，兼有潑布斯脫的「伏虎美人」之風味。</p>
<p>整個的演出，値得我們最榮譽的讚美。我希望中國的電影藝人們虛心研究。</p>
<p>在内容方面。我們知道劇作者是極力維護舊勢力的存在，然而他也看着了新的前途。殖民的的反抗，並不因殘酷的屠殺而消滅下去，失敗之後仍有他勝利的前途。雖然作者不願舊的滅亡，然而新的成長，他究竟不敢抹殺啊！</p>
<h3>「春雲紅霞」評“Born　Locky”</h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>丨丨蘭心映丨丨</p>
<p>記得藝術上的形式主義者，有一句話呌做「藝術卽手法」，這是舊的藝術家的注重形式的根本理論。所以在文字上，他們不問故事的意義如何，甚至於不問故事的是否成爲故事，而只注意描寫是否仔細結構是否奇特，這一種主張發揮到極度，就是字句的怪異和内容的紊亂</p>
<p>在電影上，同様有這一種作品。「春雲紅霞」就是極好的例子，他是說一個歌女，因爲舞台恊理的調戲，她的保護者就和恊理衝突，而終於入獄。歌女又與編劇家戀愛。同時更傭於富家，終於又爲歌女，名噪一時。</p>
<p>一看就知道這故事，是完全無意義，並且極無頭緒的。但是編劇者爲什麽採用他呢？</p>
<p>第一，上邊已經說過他們注意的只是「手法」，假使故事一長，他們就不能充能的使出「手法」來。</p>
<p>第二，「春雲紅霞」是歌劇。他所注意的。本來在歌唱方面。所以編劇者，使她旣爲歌女，中經波折，後又爲歌女，而名噪一時。這様她的唱歌的機會，就多了。我們知道「璇宫豔史」之類的歌舞片，故事大都是不連續的，這張「春雲紅霞」中間插了一個故事，至少可以使她的歌唱，加一點感情。我們就歌舞片而論歌舞片，不能不承認編劇者的聰明。</p>
<p>但是，道演者，到底怎様運用他的手法呢？首先他對於歌女歌唱之妙，是用襯託的說明的。他差不多誇張的描寫着，聽衆的反應，來表示歌女歌唱之妙。他並和其它歌劇，同様把鏡頭對正歌者鏡頭跟着她的舞蹈而走。他只是把歌聲和聽衆出神的塲面，配合起來。這種有聲藝術的應用，我以爲很好的。</p>
<p>其次，他把和普通畫面不同表式的畫面，代替歌女的向她的保護人訴說，恊理的調戲；拿畫面來代替口訴，是影片常常的。但是容易使觀衆隔斷注意力，所以他第一用和普通畫面不同形式的畫面，第二他是在銀幕上掠過，是比較普通畫面快，并且是無聲的。都足取法。</p>
<p>此外，他寫歌女保護人的入獄等等，都用非常經濟的手腕來叙述。因爲這不是本片的重心。</p>
<p>不過，在畫面上很有運用粗線條的。而這劇情根本不應該用粗線條的畫面來表現，這是不調和的。</p>
<p>演員，女主角的戲是非常多，但是在歌唱的時候，不能看到她眞的表情，因爲歌唱的表情，總有規準的。别的地方表演并不見好。</p>
<h3>電影小說女人的弱點My　Weakness（二）</h3>
<p>— 復生</p>
<p>龍納對着他的叔父道：「這都是琴意霍爾門出的主意，呌你不給我錢化的！伊勒立叔呀，你是老糊塗了！她是想在你身上開金礦哪。你被她迷糊塗了。她嫁你是爲你的錢！而她的呌你不給我錢，就是她的報復行爲！」他的叔父很生氣的道：「胡說！琴意是個天眞爛漫的好女人。」龍納道：「你眞是老糊塗了，看見隨便什麽又人都會着迷的。」伊勒立道：「没有女人可以使我上當的！」龍納道：「我倒要看看這不能呌你上當的女人呢。女人的肚子裏，都是一包壞主意。笑呀，動作呀，談話呀，都是練成預備坑害男人的！」羅羅在外面點着頭，表示十分贊成龍納對於女人的見解，但是龍納又說道：「我可以拿一個女人，隨便什麽女人，刷地板的女傭亦好，替她辦些衣服，穿上了好看的鞋，哼，叔父呀，我可以使她嫁一個社會上有名的人物！」</p>
<p>羅羅在外面聽見了，高興得了不得。龍納是萬能的。他說得到就做　到。旣說隨便什麽女子都可以的，當然她亦一定可以的。她忘其所以地竟自己開了房門，跑到龍納的房間裏去了。她做着可笑的怪様子對着龍納道：「先生，可以不可以請你先拿我試一試。」龍納看見她不告而入，十分什氣，但是羅羅繼續着道：「這似乎太冒昧了。可是你的話旣被我聽見了，我怎能不求你帮助呢？我盼望能一天一天向上：希望見見世面，和社會有些來往……你能怪我嗎？……我不要一生做女傭擦地板呀！」她歇了一歇又說道：「要是你不帮忙的話，我祗可以去嫁給馬克西了。你還没有看見馬克西那様子呢……」她的眼睛裏，已經包了一包眼淚了。伊勒立聽到這裏，跳了起來對着龍納道：「好，龍納，你說照着這位小姐的話去辦吧。要是她能嫁一個有錢的人的話，我就照舊供給你錢化！」</p>
<p>羅羅認識馬克西是很久了，但亦是很久以前的事。那時她還没有進飯店做女傭呢。馬克西是個開輸輸車的汽車夫，偶然坐着馬克西的運輸車出去兜兜圈子，倒也覺快樂。有時候一同出去吃飯，她却須自己買自己炒麵吃。爲什麽要這様呢，就因爲一個女人不能没有男朋友呀！可是現在不同了。自從她進了飯店，做了女傭，看見了龍納之後，她就白天遠遠地看着他，晚上迷迷地夢着他。看見了龍納，再看着馬克西，那是要倒胃口的，龍納頭是梳得光光的，臉是剃須白白的。藍色的襯衫，如同他的眼睛一様藍。笑起來如嗔如喜，十分可愛。</p>

<h3>建造門窗及梯級時應有的經騐</h3>
<p>— 粟</p>
<p>門·窗·及梯級三者，雖是房屋的附屬部份，然對於人類的日常生活，關係極大。門窗供給天然的光綫，空氣的流通，務期適合於衛生，方不辱建築房屋的使命。梯級則與以日常生活之便利，門窗的功用亦然，如遇火災，那末功用更大。此因，不得門，窗及梯級三者的經騐，擇要說明之。</p>
<p>（一）窗的搆造　窗所佔的面積，亦有精密的規定。學校房屋的窗，所佔的面積，須不得小於其地板面積百分之二十到二十五；窗的位置，直接影響於光綫，所以應該注意牠的佈置的方法，普通都開闢於旁壁Side　Well上。對於光線的來源及性質，宜注意下列的幾個條件：</p>
<p>（一）光線須充足。</p>
<p>（二）光線的來源，須繼續不斷。</p>
<p>（三）光線須求能散佈於全室。</p>
<p>（四）窗戶如能佈置得法，能避去太陽直射的光綫，而使其成爲反射之光線。</p>
<p>（Ｄ）窗的高度　光線射入室内，爲垂直平面所成六十度之平面隔限；如窗祇闢在一邊墻上，欲使全室之光線充足，則房間内的深度，須不得超過窗的高度的兩倍。如窗開在邊旁塲上，則其高度，不得小於房屋深度的四分之一。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）窗的面積　光線射入處面積的大小，須視室的深度，高度，窗的位置，以及玻璃之質料而定。學校房屋，須地板面積之百分二十至二十五。工廠的建築物，則窗之普通面積，須爲地板面積百分之五十至六十。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）玻璃及光線的散佈　玻璃爲傳透光線物中的最佳的材料，故窗上所用的玻璃，種類頗多，兹舉其重要如後。</p>
<p>Ａ·通常所用者，爲平面玻璃，厚度爲八分之一，或十六分之一英寸。</p>
<p>Ｂ·毛玻璃。毛玻璃的厚度，爲四分之一英寸，或四分之三英寸。</p>
<p>Ｃ·花紋玻璃。花紋玻璃的厚度，與毛玻璃相同。</p>
<p>Ａ：窗的種類及様式　歐美的窗，大約可分爲三種：（一）固定窗架，（二）活動窗架，（三）樞紐窗架。活動窗架的搆造，又可爲二種：（一）單扇活動窗，（二）雙扇活動窗架。此種活動窗架的搆造，於窗架中裝以滑輪，滑輪以繩懸之，一端平衡其重量，於是因外力拉動，滑車轉動，窗乃依窗架上之凹槽而上下活動，至於樞約窗架，全窗的活動，皆賴窗的一邊上之樞紐而轉動。此種樞紐窗架的搆造，極適合於門戶，學校及住宅的窗，大都爲樞紐窗架，我國的窗架，大致爲固定窗架及樞紐窗架二種，但我國所通用的窗架，和歐美不同，蓋我國的活動窗架，不用滑輪，乃依凹槽大半藉人力向左右拉開。</p>
<p>（二）門戶的搆造　歐美房屋的建築，對於門戶的搆造，也力求堅固，不重要的門戶，如材房及厠所等，則用架形式的門Ｌedged　door至於住宅，學校，及公司等的門戶，搆造的方式，大概都採用　板式的門Panelled　door　。</p>
<p>此種門戶的搆造方式，旣普通，又堅固。開關出入，均用活動機鎖，至於工廠門戶的建築，以鞏固爲最大的目的，故以鋼鐵爲建築門戶的材料。我國舊式房屋的門戶，皆以木材爲建築的材料。其搆造的方式，是横直的木塊相搆而成，木塊相　之處，用竹片或鐵釘之合。用樞紐搆造者，可向前後轉動，其開關的方法，全賴中間的活閂。現在　已改入歐代，但終是仿模。提出這點，是希望一般建築家，改築我國特有的門戶。</p>
<p>（三）梯級的搆造　梯爲級所接連搆造而成，故合級而成梯。每級的搆造，分爲兩部，即豎板及踏板。豎板的高度和踏板的闊度，都有一定的規律。普通豎板的高度爲七英寸至七英寸又二分之一：踏板的闊度爲十英寸至十英寸又二分之一。歐美住宅，通常至少須築兩梯，丨丨即前梯後梯丨丨前梯爲出入之用，闊度至少之英尺，斜玻度亦有一定，務使豋涉輕便，上下不費時間。歐美房屋的梯級，在住宅中，則昏爲木材。至於偉大的建築，則用石梯及三合土與鋼骨混凝土。我國房屋的梯級，與歐美不同，但搆造的材料，多爲木材，建築的梯式，亦不及歐美梯級搆造式様的精緻</p>
<p>綜觀上面各節，實是我們應有的經騐。因人我們所建築的任何建築物，復有研究和經騐，即没有科學知識，故建築的物件，終不若歐美的精緻。以後無論建築物的大小，都要有研究的精神，和科學的知識，如果如此，必能超過歐美的业緻。丨丨不但這附屬部分。</p>
<h3>房屋的層數問題</h3>
<p>— 米路</p>
<p>上古的時候。人口很少而知識又微。一切的事物。旣欠缺。又簡陋，所以房屋也没有。惟有搆木爲巢。作爲藏身避獸之處。自黃帝軒轅氏以後。人民漸多。知識漸增。才大興土木。建房築屋。以求居住的安適。到了夏朝。磚瓦出世。於是就用它來建築房屋。同時也有用石塊的。這歷代的創造。歷代的改良。建築出富麗堂皇的宫殿。萬年牢固的的城牆。在這種建築上的一切。表現出人們的知識。日新月異。人們的需求。無減有增。到了現在。中外互市。萬商雲集。人口衆多，對於房屋。需求更富。而科學昌明。層出不窮。所以在建築一途。發展更速，竟用水泥鋼鐵來建築。力求堅固。務博美觀。跨進了鋼鐵建築的時代。在這種過程之下。我們可以看到建築的産生。建築的發展。都由人們的知識。人們的需求而轉移。</p>
<p>再拿房屋來講。從前是很低的。而且很簡單。很狹小。過後才有高廳大屋。但是也不過是一層。很少有的二層三層的。到了現代。那是不對了。在各大都市。工商業發達之區。人口一天一天也增加。覺得一層的房屋實在不夠。所以由平房而爲樓房。由一層而至數十層。在外國更有數百層房屋。不過在工商業落後。人口不多的城市。還都是一層的平房。很少有二三層的樓房。在這種情形之下。我們也可以得到一個結論。房屋層數的增加。是由人口之多少。工商業之發達與是否而定的。</p>
<p>房至的層數。雖則由人口多。工商業發達。以及種種需要房屋而增加。但是我以爲人少。工商業不發達等等的情形的時候。也應當增加層數的。爲什麽呢。譬如你在一畝大小的土地上。建一座一層的房屋。已經足夠目前的需用了。但是不久之將來，忽然人口衆多。工商業發達。或者他項對於房屋的需求。必須要用二層或三層的房屋的時候。可是你在前祇建一層房子。實在不夠此時的應用。要再建築吧。又要一畝的土地，長久的時間。許多的錢費。要翻造吧。未免可惜以前的房子。並且也費錢費功夫。這様你就要追悔從前建築一層的失策了。倘然當時築了三四層的房屋。那末到了這時。正好應用。而且省土地。省錢財。省功夫。所以建築房屋。不論人多人少。工商業發達不發達。都應當增加層數的。而尤其是在這東亞第一大商埠的上海。有三百餘萬住民的上海。地價高貴的土地。便應當建築層數多的房屋。以供一切的房屋的需要。</p>
<p>對於這增加房屋層數的問題。我有一個小小的意見。我以爲房屋的　敞。不應一例的增加得很多。應當有多少之别的。在市房方面。就是開商店的房屋。應當比住宅建築得還要高。因爲在工商業這様發達的上海。築兩三層的房屋實在不敷應用。所以要築得層數多。倘然經濟不夠。或者由種種關係的話。那末祇少也應當建四五層的市房。現在大陸商塲這種房屋算最好。非但得到上邊所說種種的利益。而且還容易出租。至於住宅方面。那不宜過分高。因爲住宅之内。没有電梯的。那末倘然建層數多的房屋。一般住在裏面的人。上下實在很不便當。並且很費時間又很吃力。尤其是一輩老年人和小孩子。更加不興。所以住宅方面最適宜是三層。最高不得過四層。過分低也不興。我看上海出租於人的住宅。也就是弄里的房屋。大都是地二層。很少有三層的。這個實在可惜。並且你看現在租這種二層的住宅的二房東。他們大都自己去築閣樓。（俗稱三層樓）。而出租也很容易。這就可證明目前的上海。人口增加。需屋殷亟。二層住宅。實在不夠。所以我望以後建弄里房屋人們。最相宜最合算的。還是建築三層的房屋。</p>

<h3>現代建築物的内外修飾</h3>
<p>— 時春</p>
<p>現代的建築並不是僅造成了一所可以居住人類的房屋算已經完畢了全部的工作了，因爲人類根本是個審美觀念極重舒適慾望極高的動物，對於無論那一件事物，必力求其適當的富麗，衣食住又是人類生活上的三大要素，對於房屋的美觀舒暢自有必要的苛求，所以現代建築物的建造，牠的内外修飾却比較建築工程更有重要之價値，時代愈變遷，人類的審美觀念和舒適慾望愈增高，在二十世紀的時代，世界已趨入於文明的時期，於是建築上關於審美上的修飾亦達於最盛的時期了。</p>
<p>在歐美各國的建築學上，有所謂内建築師和外建築師Inner　and　Outer　Architect的二種建築家，尤其在美國英國德國法國等幾國對於這二種建築家分别嚴密，毫不混　，所謂内建築師者，實在並非直正的房屋建造者，因爲現代建築上對於房内外的修飾極注章，内部的修飾並非建造房屋的建築師所能盡諳，於是産生了這種内建築師，他的責任是在於拿建築的内部修飾成最美觀最舒適的一間一間，而外建築師則僅負房屋外部美觀和適用的責任。此外亦不在他責任之内，簡單的說一句，外建築師除建房屋設計外兼司房屋外部表面修飾，而内建築師則司房内部的修飾房間的佈置和各種應用的分配等等，現將内建築師所應有的修飾和外建築師所兼司的房屋外部修飾分别叙述於後，以作研究現代建築修飾的各部分參考。</p>
<p>内建築師的工作時期，必在建築物全部建造完成之後，當建築物初步造成，内部完全是普通的建築物形式，内建築師應當拿所有各部份先作一初步的分配，當然這是要請求房主的同意的，如果房間的應用完全分配定當之後，才隨着房間的作何種應用而規定佈置的方法，從臥房起，到廚房堆積室至，没有一間不作精細的佈置計畫的。現在再從應用上的不同而區别爲若干種内部建築物的佈置。作一系統的大概情形分述之。</p>
<p>臥房　臥房的佈置是比較其他一切房間重要的，因爲在歐美各國的風俗，認爲人的一生，比較在睡眠時候所過的光隂最多，假如臥房不佈置成最精美最合於理想的一所房間時，豈不妄爲了一個人，而内建築師的臥房佈置亦最爲重要，普通的臥房在家庭中，分爲成人和小孩二種，都安配在樓上，從没有將臥房分配在樓下的，臥房的内部顔色以暗淡者爲多，以明亮者少極，牆壁大概用藍色的漆，甚之有用紅色的漆的，比較講究一些的用深顔色的花紙敷於牆壁的表面，更有用避火漆漆成各種深色顔色，窗戶的方向，以不對牀的正面爲最適宜。更以易於射進日光者最合於臥室中的窗戶。門的方面亦必須在側邊，最合宜的門僅有一小面能内外開閉，其餘的都能推入牆内，如是臥室中有比較重大的傢具携入時可免受門戶的阻礙，携入携出比較利便，並且能拿二個房間併合成一個大房間，傢具的佈置亦爲内建築師所應負的責任。要之必須以適合於室内的面積及式様和能夠配合房屋的修飾爲内建築師佈置最要的一點，至於小人的臥房以美艷的顔色和紅色的牀椅棹子等爲最重要的一點，房内的面積和器具當然比較大人的臥室細小·（未完）</p>
<h3>現代建築與高層高層房屋之新傾向（下）</h3>
<p>]</p>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>在美國。人的地方。房屋的高度。也予以相當的限制。但以太陽光的是否阻碍爲標凖。換句話說。如果不阻碍太陽光。便可儘量把房屋加高。倫敦的以八十呎高度爲限。這種法令。有的省分。是没有的。有的省分。完全根據當地情形而頒佈的。就事實上。因爲一般的人。以爲英國向來没有多層房屋的建築。所以並没有這種法令的。總之。在習慣上。普通的房屋。高度總是自七十呎至八十呎而已。</p>
<p>曼　斯特和格拉斯哥。現在正在討論這種高屋問題。在不久的將來。我或許將有不少多層房屋的興築。而爲向來英國所少見的。其他各省。也正在討論這種房屋的高度。是否當加以限止。但在倫敦。尤其是衛生當局方面。對此問題。正在竭力注意。不許房屋的過高。以防發生危害。</p>
<p>房屋的加高。和防火問題。的確非常重要。因爲房屋一高。一所房屋。火燬之後。將使好多人家。遭受損失。因此。在此建築有多層化傾向之時。防火一件事。也應格外注意。就現在的趨勢說來。防火的方法。不外一方由當局的準備。救火設備的充足。而另一方面。就在房屋方面。利用了科學建築。不會着火。但在倫敦和其他若干區域。水力不足。防火器具更不能使水力達於一百呎以上的房屋。倫敦房屋的高度。以八十呎爲限。據說還是女皇維多利亞所定的。因爲有一次她靠在勃金哈官的窗口遠眺。望着了女皇安的皇宫高塔。接着她便堅執了這個高度。加入了建築法之中。</p>
<p>在現世界中。房屋增高層次的傾向。除了英國之外。各國也都是如此。尤其是繁華的都會之中。但考其增加的原因。不外兩種。一方因爲近來人民的居處。有集中城市的傾向。四鄉的人。都到城市中來找覓出路。結果使城市中人口的紀錄。一天天的增加起來，人口增加之後。所有的房屋。便有不夠居住的恐慌。結果房租。地價。都增加了。一般的地主。便不得不想法加高房屋的層次。以收容所增多的人口。另一方面。有的地主。他們現在已一天精明一天。因爲地價。土地稅。於房屋是無關的。同様的一塊土地。同様的納稅。多造幾層房屋。地主白白的可多收些房租。豈不是很便宜。於經濟方面。地主自然是很有利呢。那又何樂而不爲啊。</p>
<p>我們去開了海外。來一說上海。近來上海的建築。也有加高層次的趨向。不信。你看向來兩層的舊屋。拆造之後。新屋都是三層以上了。至於市房。在熱閙的區域之中。像南京路。江西路。四川路等。新造的市房。十九在五六層之上。上海的房屋。層次的加高。唯一原因。當然也因人口的增加。和地主的儘量利用土地。但上海正和倫敦一様。地基很鬆。没有紐約的堅固。所以房屋的層次。也不能儘量增加。漫無限制。同時。防火的力量。是否水力可達若干層之上。也是一個値得研究的問題。而且就上海的環境說來。市中心區的建設。因爲土地的廣泛。可分散租界上一部的勢力。我們從這些事實上聽得到的一個結論。是上海的建築。近來雖有增加層次的傾向。但在短時期内。斷然不會形成一個高屋的都市。而這裏所說的高屋。也不是像紐約的一様。萬一實現。至多也不過十層左右的房屋而已。</p>
<h3>▲建築界之新貢獻</h3>
<p>雅理製造廠之各種國貨避水物品。如避水漿，避水漆，透明避水漆等。發行以來。早爲建築界及營造界所推許。該廠廠主鄭汝翼工程師。對於避水建築村料。研究有素。近更發明有「特快精」一種（西文名爲Ouika）。能使水泥於數秒鐘内堅結。爲提壩地坑等避水工程之要品。現由「特快精」修好之工程有花旗銀行等數十處。惟該物非經特殊訓練之工人。不諳使用。故該廠工程部專用以承辦地坑避水工程云。</p>

<h3>Huang Zhao and De Wang, etc. Exchange Informal Opinions 丨 Specific Discussions Can Be Held Within Days 丨 Huang Zhao Hosts a Banquet for the Panchen Lama, etc. 丨 Mongolian Princes Request to Watch Horse Racing</h3>
<p>(Beiping) From Guihua Telegraph: Since Huang Shaoxiong and Zhao Pilian arrived at Bailingmiao, the situation has improved. The resolution of the autonomous conference has been presented to De Wang and others. On the 12th, both parties exchanged informal opinions, and specific discussions can be held within days. On the evening of the 12th, Huang and Zhao hosted a banquet in batches at the Xingyuan for the Panchen Lama, various princes, and representatives. Gifts were distributed on the afternoon of the 12th. The Panchen Lama has scheduled a banquet for Huang and Zhao on the afternoon of the 13th. In the afternoon of the 12th, the Panchen Lama and De Wang's guards performed wrestling. On the 13th, horse racing will be performed. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Supervisory Committee member Bai Rui came north previously under Wang's orders to assist in handling the Inner Mongolia autonomous affairs. After Bai arrived in Beiping, he consulted with the Mongolian Compatriot Association in Beiping several times and will convey the central government's intentions. Bai plans to go to Suiyuan or Bailingmiao to participate in the meeting between Huang and Zhao and various princes. He sent a letter to Wang yesterday to request instructions. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Shaoxiong and Zhao Pilian sent a lengthy telegram to President Wang of the Executive Yuan, reporting on their meeting with various princes, saying that although the princes were very unfamiliar with the central government's political situation, they had no preconceived notions for many years and had been inheriting their titles for a long time, enjoying extreme freedom. They have no other ambitions except maintaining their original status. Their concept of the nation is very weak, but they still greatly admire the central government. The so-called autonomy movement fundamentally does not require this idea, and the Bailingmiao conference was organized by a few young representatives who lack genuine understanding and have some ambition. In fact, it does not represent the public opinion of the Mongolians, nor even the public opinion of the princes. Most of the princes and chief stewards with higher prestige and seniority do not know the meaning of this movement. After separate explanations, most have understood the central government's intentions and are willing to work for the welfare of the Mongolians under the leadership of the central government. However, there are still a few individuals who, although not dissenting from the central government's principles, still have a wavering attitude, so further explanation is necessary, but the situation is extremely optimistic. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Bailingmiao On the afternoon of the 13th at 3 p.m., various princes specially invited Huang, Zhao, Xu, and others to watch the Mongolian horse racing. There were about thirty horses, and the spectators were shoulder to shoulder, praising in unison. At 6 p.m. in the evening, the Panchen Lama hosted a banquet for Huang, Zhao, Xu, and their entourages, totaling more than thirty people. The guests and hosts were very happy. (13th Central News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bailingmiao, 12th Dispatch: Huang Shaoxiong told reporters that after inspecting various places in Inner Mongolia this time, he can understand the actual situation of politics, military affairs, and economy, study them, and use them as reference materials for various actions of the central government in the future. The inspection locations are not limited to Bailingmiao, and it is not just to hold a meeting here to solve a certain problem. Regarding the Inner Mongolia autonomy issue, there are inaccuracies in what is reported in the newspapers. I hope the media can obtain real news and announce it to the world. Now I can tell you a few points for reference. The Mongolian population in the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan is now no more than 300,000, which is only one-thirteenth of the total population of the two provinces, which is a very small number. Moreover, the people who came here to gather are also a minority, a very small number of Mongolians. They are only expressing an opinion based on their will, requesting the central government to reform politics and economy. Originally, the reform of various local undertakings has received much attention from the central government and various parties, because it is necessary to adopt the opinions of the majority of the people as the basis. As for the opinions of a minority, we also pay close attention to adopting them for reference and never neglect them. I will never lightly believe or value outside rumors, because the central government has the power and methods to deal with certain problems, and will never abandon its主張and responsibility. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Proclamation of the Executive Yuan to the People of Inner Mongolia Regarding Political Opinions, Hoping for Frank Consultation with Huang Zhao</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan compiled and printed a proclamation in both Chinese and Mongolian languages, and sent experts to Bailingmiao to deliver it to Huang Zhao for distribution and posting in various leagues and banners. The original text reads: Our party takes the Three Principles of the People as the guiding principle of governance. Its principle of nationalism inherently contains two aspects: first, the Chinese nation seeks its own liberation; second, all ethnic groups within China are equal. Based on this principle, the National Government treats all ethnic groups in the country equally, without any discrimination. Inner Mongolia is located in a border area, which is related to national defense. The central government has done its best to benefit our ethnic compatriots. However, due to years of foreign and domestic troubles and frequent disasters, there may be shortcomings in the administrative facilities in the border areas. This is what the government is deeply worried about. The people of Inner Mongolia hope to promote autonomy. The central government not only has no intention of refusing to allow it, but also gladly guides and assists it to achieve success. However, the prerequisite for autonomy is that the people have considerable training in politics and a considerable surplus in the economy. Only by establishing a plan and advancing step by step can the desired results be achieved. Education, culture, and economic life in Inner Mongolia all urgently need to be developed, and political training is especially unprepared. If a high degree of autonomy is implemented all at once, it will only be nominal. The people will still not be able to exercise their rights as before, and the economy will still not be able to meet the needs as before. Even the effects may not be seen, and disturbances will only increase. This is what the government understands and is deeply concerned about. However, although the government does not want to overstep the mark in pursuing autonomy to establish a false name, it earnestly hopes to work hard to seek practical results, and strive to give Mongolian princes and leaders, as well as young people with political training, considerable political status, so that they can display their talents to benefit the country and society. As for the cultural life and economic life of all Mongolians, we should also do our best to support and improve them, strengthen their ability to defend themselves against foreign aggression, and cultivate their ability to implement autonomy, so as to realize true local autonomy in the near future, as stipulated in the party's outline for national construction. This procedure is not only true for Mongolia, but also the same for the mainland. However, the customs, habits, languages, and religions of the Mongolian people are slightly different from those of the mainland. This is what the government specially considers. If a political organization managed by Mongolians is specially established under the provincial administrative region and the provincial administrative system to try out preliminary autonomy, it can not only avoid the disadvantages of separation, but also assist the shortcomings of the provincial government and achieve cooperative effects. In general, as long as it does not violate the general laws of the country and does not hinder the administrative system of various provinces, the central government will sincerely cooperate with it and do its best to seek the welfare of the Mongolian people. Because the road is far away, I am deeply afraid that the will will be blocked. Therefore, I specially sent Minister Huang of the Interior to inspect in person, and also sent Vice-Chairman Zhao of the Mongolian League to assist in everything, declare the central government's good intentions, and discuss the autonomy plan. If the princes and league and banner officials, as well as local people, have good plans or suggestions for reform and improvement, they must report to the minister and others without concealment, and they will surely be able to seek a satisfactory solution to meet the earnest expectations of our Mongolian compatriots. Today, foreign troubles are deepening. The people of our five ethnic groups are one family. All opinions should be expressed freely, and frank consultations should be conducted to eliminate misunderstandings, educate harmony, unite as one, and be sincere. The revival of our nation and the glory of our people depend on it. This is a proclamation to make it known to all.

<p>(Tianjin) He Yingqin, along with his family members and entourage, arrived in Tianjin from Beiping on a special train with one baggage car attached to the third train on the Beining Railway. He arrived at the new station at 11:30 a.m. Those who came to the station to welcome him included Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong, Civil Affairs Director Wei Jian, Education Director Chen Baoquan, Mayor Wang Tao, Public Security Bureau Chief Ning Xiangnan, Beining Railway Director Yin Tong, Japanese military officer Takahashi, Deputy Adjutant Ohtake, and more than thirty others. Yu, Yin, and others boarded the train to welcome him and immediately went to the provincial government to rest. He shook hands with reporters and said with a smile, "The rain is heavy and the weather is cold today. I am deeply grateful to everyone for coming to the station." Then, he answered reporters' questions. "Okamura's visit to Beiping this time is of a visiting nature and does not carry any negotiation mission. Therefore, issues such as opening traffic and postal services have not been discussed. Regarding the reception of Shanhaiguan, the Japanese side stated that it would take quite some time for the Japanese army to withdraw, and the reception would not be possible until about two months later. The reception of other ports has not been discussed yet. I am now in Beiping to handle North China's military affairs and have received a lot of direct and indirect help from leaders from all walks of life in Tianjin and celebrities in opposition. I am deeply grateful for that. Now that the overall situation in North China is gradually stabilizing, I have taken time to visit friends in Tianjin. Because I cannot stay for long, I have scheduled a dinner tonight at the Beining Apartment on Haihe Road in the Special Zone One to invite friends to gather and thank them for their past help. I will return to Beiping tomorrow morning. As for the military salaries in North China, the central government is still allocating them on a monthly basis. The arrears are the local auxiliary funds. The two provinces of Hebei and Chahar and the two cities of Beiping and Tianjin have a total of 100,000 yuan in auxiliary funds per month. Since the military affairs occurred in the two provinces of Hebei and Chahar, the income of the provincial treasury has decreased, and the auxiliary funds have not been paid for a long time. This time, I will discuss this matter with Chairman Yu and Mayor Wang in Tianjin. As for the problem of Sun Dianying's army being blocked from entering Xikai, there is currently no solution, so let's let them stay in their original place for the winter." A reporter asked, "Northern soldiers suspect that the central government cannot be frank with each other, treats the central army favorably, and treats the northern army lightly. In addition, some people are engaged in improper business, which tarnishes the military image. I hope the chairman will pay attention." He replied, "The central army's number is based on the established system, and we dare not add a single person privately. The military salaries are naturally sufficient. Other armies do not follow the central government's established system, resulting in the phenomenon of many soldiers and few salaries. In fact, the central government treats all armies in the country equally, without any difference. I have heard of soldiers doing improper business, but there is no way to stop it. I hope that those who lead troops will realize that soldiers are valued for their quality, not their quantity, and that they should not disturb the people. If the people can live in peace, all construction will be on the right track." At this point, the reporters resigned. At 12:30 p.m., Yu Xuezhong held a reception banquet at the provincial government. At 7 p.m., He hosted a banquet for reporters from various newspapers, as well as the provincial chairman, directors, Mayor Wang, and Sun Chuanfang, Qi Xieyuan, Zhang Zhitan, Jin Yunpeng, and other forty people. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin said that Okamura's previous visit to Beiping did not have any mission, and he did not discuss issues such as opening traffic and postal services. Regarding the reception of Yuguan, the Japanese side stated that it would take quite some time for the withdrawal of troops, about two months before it could be received. There are no arrears in the central government's military salaries in North China, but there are many arrears in local auxiliary funds. The two provinces of Chahar and Hebei and the two cities of Beiping and Tianjin have a total of 1.1 million in auxiliary funds per month. Later, due to the military and diplomatic conflict between Chahar and Hebei, they have not been paid for a long time, and the military salaries are insufficient for distribution. There is no solution to the problem of Sun's army being blocked from entering Xikai, and they have temporarily stationed in their original defense for the winter. The number of Sun's army has been verified by the central government to be seven infantry regiments and three cavalry regiments, but Sun has now expanded to more than twenty regiments. Therefore, Qinghai is worried that if Sun's army enters, the military salaries will be insufficient and the people will be unable to bear it, so they have opposed it. Sun said that the army would find a way to downsize. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin, along with his wife and son, went to Tianjin this morning. Those who accompanied him included Secretary Xie Zongyuan, Military Branch Section Chief Zhu Shiqin, Tao Shangming, and Wang Lun and others. Hou Cheng and Bao Wenye went to Tianjin last night to arrange the Xingyuan. He told reporters that since he came to the north, he had been busy with military affairs and had been very estranged from friends from all walks of life. Now that the political affairs are slightly idle, he has made a special trip to Tianjin to visit friends from all walks of life and has no other mission. He will return to Beiping in about one or two days. After He arrives in Tianjin, he will invite friends to a gathering tonight. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin has scheduled a banquet at Jurentang on the evening of the 16th to bid farewell to Lan Bolin, and has invited many people from the military and political circles and celebrities to accompany him. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Minister He hosted a banquet for celebrities from all walks of life in Tianjin at the Beining official residence on Haihe Road on the evening of the 13th and delivered a speech as follows: "I, Yingqin, was ordered to come to the north and it has been almost a year in the blink of an eye. I have long wanted to take time to come to Tianjin to visit you gentlemen and personally receive your teachings. However, due to the busy military affairs and the complexity of the affairs, I have been thinking about it for a long time, but it has been difficult to fulfill my wish. Recently, various matters have gradually become organized, so I have made a special trip here to prepare a cup of wine to express my feelings and have a frank conversation, to express my admiration from the bottom of my heart. Fortunately, you gentlemen do not abandon my ignorance and have come to this place, so I am extremely honored. You gentlemen have all shouldered major responsibilities for the country in the past. Although you have now been relieved of your duties and are hiding your talents, whether you are in or out of office, your responsibilities to the country remain the same. I sincerely hope that you gentlemen will not hesitate to offer your valuable advice at any time and on any matter. Today, our country is full of separatist warlords, and disasters have occurred year after year. The rural areas are bankrupt, industry and commerce are declining, and the suffering of the people is extreme. If we want to relieve the suffering of the people, we must eliminate bandits, promote rural prosperity, and transfer the funds concentrated in the cities to the rural areas of the interior as much as possible, and actively engage in construction and restoration work. We must first ensure that the people in the countryside have food to eat, and then the people in the cities will not be hungry. On the one hand, we must also try to change the mentality of the general public and use the money stored in the big banks in the cities to work hard to develop the border areas, so that the endless resources can be used by us as much as possible. Regarding transportation, the active construction of railways, highways, aviation, and other industries is also a matter of urgency. A week ago, I went to Qinglongqiao on the Ping-Sui Railway to inspect, and I was able to admire the bronze statue of Mr. Zhan Tianyou, who created and repaired the Ping-Sui Railway. I feel that the current China needs dozens, hundreds, thousands of people like Zhan Tianyou to save China. If everyone only knows how to set up exchanges and open big shops in a few big cities, squeeze the blood and sweat of the majority, and provide for the enjoyment of a few people, then the result of畸形development will still be of no benefit to the country, and the suffering of the people will only deepen. I also feel that the reason why the country has been in constant turmoil in recent decades is due to the decline of national consciousness, and the decline of national consciousness is due to the decline of national morality. Over time, Chinese people have turned to regard morality as unimportant, and many unfilial, unkind, unfaithful, untrustworthy, rude, unrighteous, shameless things can be done. The sanctions of the law are not enough to encompass people's hearts, and the prevention of morality has disappeared. How can the country not be in chaos? How can it not fall into a hopeless situation? If we want to uplift the hearts of the people in distress and save the declining national situation, we can only work together from the top to the bottom, and restore the morality of our nation, including filial piety, kindness, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Only by restoring these inherent moralities can we remedy the poverty of the law and enable the Chinese nation to revive. I also feel that there is still a great crisis lurking in North China today. What is the crisis? It is the secret activities of the Communist Party. The Communist Party was not noticed in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian in the past, but when its wings were formed, it burned, killed, looted, and turned the land red for thousands of miles. Although the activities of the Communist Party in North China are not yet obvious, if we do not think about preventing it, once it breaks out, it will be out of control. The method of prevention, such as relying solely on the military and police to investigate, arrest, and prohibit the propaganda of their writings at any time and any place, can at most prevent it temporarily. If we want to truly cure the root cause, the first condition is still to find a way to relieve the suffering of the people and enable the people of the country to live and work in peace and contentment, and do their best to enjoy food, clothing, housing, and transportation. The second condition is to restore the inherent morality of the nation, so that everyone takes filial piety, kindness, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame as the highest principles of standing and acting, then the Communist Party will have no way to take advantage of the opportunity to act. Some of you gentlemen have worked with me, and some of you are meeting for the first time. There are many things I want to say, but today I am limited by time and cannot talk as much as I want, so I am very sorry. I would like to raise a glass to wish you gentlemen good health."

<h3>There Are Already Concrete Strategies for Governing Xinjiang, First Stop Military Action, Luo Ding Will Go to Gan Today to Meet Chiang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan returned to Beijing from Tianjin on the 11th and immediately visited President Wang to report on the inspection of the West. At 6 p.m. on the 13th, he convened a meeting of the heads of various central ministries to listen to Luo's report and discuss ways to solve the Xinjiang issue. The public believes that Luo's opinions are appropriate. It was not until late at night that it dispersed. On the evening of the 13th, Wang again invited Luo to Wang's residence at No. 1 of the Railway Department to have another conversation. There have been concrete results in the strategies for governing Xinjiang. According to the Central News Agency reporter's investigation from relevant parties, the central government's handling of the Xinjiang issue has achieved great success due to Luo's return from inspection and the good results obtained. The first step in stabilizing Xinjiang is to stop military action. Since there are concrete strategies, Wang, Luo, and others have very consistent opinions. Luo is scheduled to take a boat from Beijing to Gan on the morning of the 14th to meet Chairman Chiang and report on his trip to Xinjiang. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Five Ministries Secretly Discuss Various Sino-Japanese Cases in North China</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the afternoon of the 13th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs invited representatives from the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Finance to hold a meeting to study countermeasures on issues such as opening traffic, opening postal services, and establishing customs. It did not end until 5 p.m. As for the results, it is not easy to find out because the attendees are keeping secrets. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Issue of Establishing Customs Duties at Various Passes of the Great Wall Adopts the Method of Transferring Collection and Decides Not to Establish Another Name</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After Okamura agreed with our side on the principles of various unresolved incidents in the war zone in Beiping, the Ministry of Finance specially sent Tax Affairs Director Ding Guitang to Beiping to contact Huang and conduct detailed research on the issue of establishing customs. Another Deputy Tax Affairs Director Zhang Yongnian was sent north to assist in the investigation of the situation at various passes of the Great Wall. Due to the large number of bandits along the line, the progress was difficult, and only the Gubeikou area was completed. Now our side is preparing to establish customs locations, including Gubeikou, Xifengkou, Lengkou, Yiyuan Kou, Jielingkou, Panjiakou, and Yuguan. The tax will still be collected in the name of Binjiang Kou, Yingkou, and other places, and no other name will be established. The four northeastern provinces are the territory of our country, so the 36 kinds of native products transported into the customs will still be taxed at the domestic product tax rate, while others will be taxed according to Japanese and Korean goods. At present, the Japanese side has established many customs in Rehe, with Chengde as the general customs. Other branch customs have been established and collected in Gubeikou, Luanping, Pingquan, Lingyuan, Chifeng, and other places. However, Panjiakou has not yet been established, and the European Ender has been hired as the customs director. Our side will never recognize the customs established by the Japanese side in Rehe.

(13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng said that according to the investigation, there is about one battalion of pseudo-troops occupying Malan and slightly east of the Eastern Mausoleum, refusing to withdraw under the pretext of protecting the mausoleum. I have negotiated with the Japanese side and the Kwantung Army has ordered the pseudo-troops to withdraw. Our side will send police to take over. After the Jiji District Inspector's Office is established, I plan to inspect the various passes of the Great Wall and various counties under my jurisdiction for a week to reorganize telecommunications and transportation to restore the pre-war state. The person in charge of the Beiping Postal Reorganization Bureau stated that the central government is fully responsible for the issue of postal services in the Northeast, and the bureau has not received any orders.

<h3>Ministry of Communications Prevents Japanese Ships from Carrying Private Mail, Please Pay Attention to Inspection by Customs</h3>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>— Original</p>
<p>The Japanese militarists launched a military force, loudly proclaiming an extraordinary period. Commentators believe that their intention is actually to use the name of national crisis to stimulate their people and make them rise up and unite against external forces, and to shift their focus to imaginary enemies, because they fear domestic economic panic and the collapse of the rural areas will shake the people's hearts and make it impossible to maintain stability. Therefore, Japan's cries of national crisis are aimed at domestic concerns. Germany's Hitler resolutely withdrew from the League of Nations, loudly proclaiming military equality to all countries in the world and demanding self-defense, declaring that national dignity cannot be humiliated for a single day. In repeated speeches, he was passionate and resolute, expressing an extremely tough stance. Commentators also believe that he is using this to arouse the discontented people in his country and make them support his position. Therefore, his advocacy of an extraordinary period is also aimed at domestic concerns. Yesterday's Japanese dispatch described the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' observations on the situation in Soviet Russia, also stating that Soviet Russia's large-scale external propaganda is due to its internal disunity, so it is loudly proclaiming the coming of a national crisis and releasing all kinds of inaccurate military news to stimulate its people. Their intention is also to say that Soviet Russia's cries of national crisis are for domestic consumption. Whether the tense situation between Japan and Russia today is for Soviet Russia's domestic consumption or for Japan's domestic consumption, we will not discuss for the time being. However, the use of this intense method of bloodthirsty philosophy as a domestic tool has become the most popular new policy of political leaders in various countries today. However, we believe that when injecting this kind of medicine into the bodies of young people, the first thing to ask is whether the medicine and the disease are compatible, and the second thing to ask is whether the patient's body can handle the effects of the medicine after it takes effect. If measurements are not taken in advance and injections are given rashly, they will not only be ineffective but also dangerous. It is like speculators in the business world whose own strength is insufficient. Once they fail, they will be caught off guard and inevitably lead to an irrecoverable situation. Therefore, today, to deal with the current international problems, it is necessary to first seek internal and external consistency, and to make national strength and popular strength substantial. When popular strength is substantial, there will be no worries about internal affairs when dealing with external affairs, and great assistance can be obtained. When national strength is substantial, there will be no fear of external threats, and domestic sympathy can be aroused. From this perspective, it is unreliable to try to stimulate the domestic people and make them rise up, or suppress them and make them fall down, by means of exaggerated and sensational propaganda aimed at external forces alone. Conversely, it is certainly impossible to rely on the vain and arrogant popular sentiment at home as a tool for diplomacy and expect it to be victorious.</p>
<p>Now let me summarize it again. Since the world economy fell into ruin, people's lives have been insecure, factories have closed down, and goods cannot be sold. Therefore, they are seeking a way out in foreign markets. However, to seek a way out in foreign markets, it is necessary to first expand military preparations and study attack and defense. To expand military preparations and study attack and defense, international suspicion arises and disputes occur. Therefore, the reason for loudly proclaiming a national crisis originally stemmed from domestic concerns, in order to maintain domestic security. However, once international disputes arise, the diplomatic response naturally becomes increasingly serious, and peace is gradually threatened with rupture. At this time, the authorities' handling of diplomacy has become a case of riding a tiger. On the one hand, they still pay lip service to advocating peace, and on the other hand, they are urgently preparing military force to await a final solution, while also fearing the suspicion of the people. Therefore, they loudly proclaim a national crisis or an extraordinary period to stimulate the people to rise up and do their best to support their own position. It can be seen that today's so-called domestic concern is different from the original intention of domestic concern. The original intention of domestic concern was simply to seek a way out for the people's lives, while today's domestic concern is almost gambling with the fate of the entire country, and the danger is not considered. Alas, today's world is like a drunken man, acting madly. In addition to doing its best to prepare for military force, it is also creating all kinds of news to provoke war, externally to alarm international public opinion and internally to arouse the people's hearts. It is galloping wildly without looking back. Where is peace?</p>
<p>However, national crises cannot be generalized either. If it is a genuine national crisis, a national crisis with justice and righteousness, which is related to the life and death of the country and the nation, and its people are numb and insensitive, then stimulating domestic sentiment is indeed necessary. Otherwise, if it is for the sake of developing aggressive ambitions, deliberately exaggerating and fabricating what they call a national crisis, like Japan, then it will truly plunge the country into crisis. What other path is there for the result of their efforts to address domestic concerns?</p>
<h3>Report on the Two Weekly Memorial Services of the Central National Government - Ye Chucang: Situation of Bandit Suppression in Jiangxi - Shao Yuanchong: Political and Economic Construction</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At 9:00 a.m. on the 13th, the Central Government held its 104th weekly memorial service for Sun Yat-sen. Those present included Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, Huang Fusheng, Deng Jiayan, Wang Qi, Miao Peicheng, Xie Zuomin, Li Ciwen, Ma Chaojun, and all staff members, totaling more than 500 people. Chairman Ye Chucang led the ceremony as usual and then delivered a report, stating briefly that now, in the bandit suppression campaign in Jiangxi, not only the officers and soldiers at the front lines are filled with the spirit of eliminating bandit traces, but also the people of Jiangxi are the same. This kind of strength is due to the training of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for several months, and the joint efforts of all comrades in the party and government. Because everyone has made the greatest determination and courage, this campaign is indeed promising. The participation of the Jiangxi people in the bandit suppression work, forming defense corps, and building highways has greatly benefited the military campaign. The military method of this bandit suppression campaign is not to seek a quick attack, but to take a steady and solid strategy, especially the bunker method, which is most effective. Now the bandit area is being encircled smaller and smaller, and there is a phenomenon of collapse within the bandits, and they are surrendering one after another. The elimination of bandit troubles can certainly be victorious. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said that bandit suppression requires three parts military affairs and seven parts politics. For example, an airplane, military affairs is the fuselage, politics is the wings, and the engine is equivalent to the political organization after the bandit area is recovered, none of which can be missing. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is working extremely hard at the front lines. We in the rear must ask the comrades at the front to fight desperately, and what the front asks of the rear is stability and assistance. We should know that bandit suppression is not a matter for Jiangxi Province alone, but a responsibility of the people of the whole country. If the bandits cannot be eliminated in Jiangxi, then it is possible for Jiangxi to become a second Jiangxi everywhere, as can be seen from the lesson of Suiding in Sichuan. I hope that all comrades in the rear will do two things for the military campaign of bandit suppression: stability and assistance. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 10:00 a.m. on the 13th, the National Government held a weekly memorial service. Those present included Lin Xiang, Li Yuanding, Shao Yuanchong, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, Chen Yi, and other National Government officials, totaling more than 400 people. Chairman Shao Yuanchong led the ceremony and then reported on political design and economic design, stating briefly that political construction is aimed at the survival of the nation and the creation of national culture, while economic construction is aimed at solving the people's livelihood. We should take internal and external troubles as the targets of political and economic design. Whether it is education, national defense, bandit suppression, or relieving the suffering of the people, there must be a comprehensive plan before it can be effective. Otherwise, we will attend to one thing and lose sight of another, giving too much importance to one thing and too little to another, or even achieving the opposite result. For example, the questions proposed for this college entrance examination are quite inconsistent with the current teaching materials of various schools. This is the result of the lack of a comprehensive plan for the implementation of education and the holding of examinations. Within a country, no matter what kind of undertaking, not only must special talents be employed under special circumstances to promote work and establish a foundation, but also the design of the undertaking must adapt to the needs of the environment. For example, if there are tens of thousands of people in a city, the number of schools, doctors, and security guards to be set up should be planned to meet their needs. Although a specific number cannot be predetermined, a general number should always be specified so that the residents of the city can live in peace. The political and economic design of a country is also like this. To achieve the success of political and economic construction, there must be a perfect design in all aspects.

<h3>Results of German Public Opinion Polls Released - Hitler Wins Big - High Voter Turnout, Unprecedented - Ninety Percent Support the Chancellor's Policies</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today, Germany held a nationwide vote to re-elect the House of Representatives and to express support for or opposition to the domestic and foreign policies of the National Socialist Party government. As expected, the National Socialist Party won a major victory. The participation of men and women throughout Germany in the vote was unusually high. The percentage of voters participating in the vote was higher than ever before. The average result of the vote did not change much throughout the day. According to the situation in the afternoon, out of 16.2 million voters, those who supported the policies of the National Socialist Party accounted for 94.1%, while those who opposed it accounted for only 4.4%, and invalid votes accounted for 1.5%. As for the votes for the re-election of the House of Representatives, those who supported the candidate list recommended by the government accounted for about 92.8% of the total votes, and invalid votes accounted for 7.2%. According to the situation when the voting was about to end, a total of 41,262,642 voters participated in the vote, of which 38,567,825 people supported the current government's policies, only 1,953,735 people opposed it, and 741,082 votes were invalid. From this, it can be seen that those who support the government account for about 53.5% of the total voters, those who oppose it account for 4.7%, and invalid votes account for 1.8%. This ratio can be regarded as final. (Havas dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The tentative final election figures are as follows: a total of 43,007,577 votes were cast nationwide, of which 39,655,288 votes were for Hitler's parliamentary candidates, and 3,352,289 votes were invalid. At the same time, a plebiscite was held to determine whether the people supported Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. The result was that out of 43,464,420 votes, 40,618,147 votes were marked "yes," 2,055,363 votes were marked "no," and 790,010 votes were invalid. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>German People Support the Government</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The majority of the German people have expressed their support for the National Socialist Party's list of parliamentary candidates and Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. By 11:00 p.m. tonight, 25,377,901 votes have been counted, of which 23,583,575 votes were for the National Socialist Party and 1,794,326 votes were invalid. Regarding the government's question of whether they support the government's policies and are willing to solemnly swear to uphold them, a total of 25,780,241 votes have been counted by 11:00 p.m., of which 24,205,998 votes were marked "yes," 1,157,035 votes were marked "no," and 417,208 votes were invalid. As of 8:00 p.m. tonight, over 90% of the voters have clearly voted in favor of the government, so the government's victory is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>During the election held in March of this year, Hitler received the support of 17 million people. This time, it has increased to 30 million. One of its greatest characteristics is that the 12 million people who supported the Socialist Party or the Communists in March have now voted for the National Socialist Party, which proves that Hitler's boast of eliminating German Marxism and Bolshevism is true.</p>
<p>Germany had previously issued comments, saying that this election was to determine whether to choose between world force or construction. German policy has firmly decided to engage in construction. Now, others should take care of themselves, but it must be based on equal rights. Those who wish to work for pacifism must not talk about sanctions, retaliation, or not returning the Saar region to Germany.</p>
<h3>Election Voting Was Exceptionally Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>The voting in this election was exceptionally enthusiastic. Often, it was necessary to wait for several hours before being able to approach the ballot box. Members of the Stormtroopers rode in open-top motorcycle cars to various polling places, entertaining the waiting voters with military music. The business of restaurants and beer gardens was unusually prosperous. Many voters celebrated with heavy drinking. Germans living outside of Germany often returned to the country in groups to vote. However, the deposed Emperor Wilhelm remained in the Netherlands. His son and other members of the imperial family all went to Potsdam to vote. In many places, the entire village or town unanimously voted in favor of Hitler. Occasionally, one or two people cast opposing votes. By noon, 90% of the voters in the electoral districts had voted. The industrial areas, which were formerly communist strongholds, were particularly enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Hitler Goes to the Factory to Vote</h3>
<p>Unlike other cabinet members who voted in the government district, Hitler drove to the workers' canteen of the Siemens factory to vote. Hitler's broadcast speech on Friday was issued from this factory.</p>
<p>Berlin and other cities, especially industrial centers, were the most closely watched because they had previously supported the Republican Party and the Communist Party. However, the results of this vote have proven that Hitler has gained momentum in these cities.</p>
<p>Although there were no women on the National Socialist Party's list of candidates, women quietly accepted Hitler's list. After joining the parliament, German women proposed social legislation to improve the nation's health, which was destroyed during the Great War. Their contributions are highly commendable.</p>
<p>Today, thousands of school directors marched in formation through the streets, expressing "Honor and Peace."</p>
<p>Berlin was quiet today. No incidents were reported anywhere in the country. It is believed that no one was injured in this election. Even in the former communist strongholds, very few of the election posters were torn down, and there were not more police than usual. (Reuters dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<h3>Silence and Quiet Unprecedented</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The silence with which today's German plebiscite was held was unprecedented. The polling places began to open at 9:00 a.m., and people began gathering in front of the polling places as early as 1:00 a.m. Those who arrived later had to queue up in front of the polling place. Each person received a blank ballot paper with the words "German men and women, do you support your government's current policies? Are you willing to uphold these policies as your own policies?" The special feature of this election is that there were no police monitoring the scene. This vote was also anonymous. The ballot boxes were opened in public afterwards. The voting has not yet ended, but in East Prussia, out of 1.47 million voters, 1.42 million have already voted. In the parliamentary elections, out of 1.4 million votes, the National Socialist Party accounted for 1.37 million votes. Within the territory of Thuringia, 1.6 million people voted, of which 1.56 million supported the government. (Guomin Dian on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) In this plebiscite and parliamentary election, although the average number of voters was between 93% and 94%, there were several electoral districts where the number of votes cast exceeded 100%, making it an unprecedentedly enthusiastic vote in Germany. In the Mainz farming area, 97% of the people voted, and out of 22,500 votes, 21,000 supported the government's actions. In Bamberg, Bavaria, 99% of the people voted, and out of 37,000 votes, 35,000 supported the government, while 32,000 votes were cast in favor of the National Socialist Party's parliamentary candidates. In the industrial areas near Berlin, which were formerly communist strongholds, there was also widespread support for the government. Generally speaking, the voter turnout for this parliamentary election was slightly lower than that for the plebiscite. (Guomin Dian on the 12th)</p>
<h3>Prisoners Unanimously Support</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to Hitler and his cabinet members, the German people have shown the world their sincerity in supporting the National Socialist Party's peaceful policies. In this general election, Hitler has won a complete victory. Even prisoners held in prisons uniformly lean towards the National Socialist Party. It is said that the government is quite pleased that political prisoners can believe in National Socialism, and soon an amnesty for political prisoners may be ordered.</p>
<p>The results of the Berlin city elections show that 1,113,133 votes were cast in favor of Hitler, a far cry from the 398,687 votes cast in the March parliamentary elections this year.</p>
<p>To celebrate the National Socialist Party's election victory, the Minister of Propaganda has ordered people across the country to hang flags today for celebration.</p>
<p>The only unfortunate incident during the election was in Detmold, where a communist distributed leaflets and was shot and killed by the police while trying to escape.</p>
<h3>Future Plans for Centralization</h3>
<p>Hitler's future plans will be announced soon. It is said that the government is preparing a large-scale constitutional reform. The first step will be to abolish the federal system. For administrative convenience, Germany will be divided into several regions in the manner of France to implement a centralized system.</p>
<p>According to official preliminary statistics, the Hitler parliamentary candidate list received 42,975,009 votes, of which 39,626,647 were in favor of the National Socialist Party, and 3,348,366 were invalid. At the same time, the results of the plebiscite on Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference showed a total of 43,439,046 votes. 40,588,804 votes marked "Yes," 2,100,181 votes marked "No," and 750,061 votes were invalid. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Electoral Feat in German History</h3>
<p>(Berlin) This morning, German newspapers expressed joy at yesterday's election results, saying that no statesman in the world can boast of gaining the trust of his countrymen like Hitler. According to the final report, 40,588,000 votes were cast, of which 95.1% voted "Yes." The National Socialist Party received 39,626,000 votes in the parliamentary election. Therefore, the new parliament will be composed of 680 members. 96% of eligible voters voted. This is the largest number of voters in German election history. Only 5% of votes were invalid or marked "No." After midnight, the first preliminary report on the election confirmed Hitler's victory. Hitler then published an article thanking the people and party members for their loyalty and their expression of true love of peace, honor, and equality. (National News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Widespread Enthusiasm for Voting</h3>
<p>Munich All the nuns of the Good Shepherd Convent here unanimously voted in favor of the government's policies and the National Socialist Party's parliament. Germany's highest mountain, the Zugspitze, located in the Bavarian Alps, also saw tourists and hotel staff unanimously vote in favor of the government. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Hefal During this German election, Germans living abroad also returned to the country to vote. Five hundred German residents of Estonia chartered a German cargo ship to vote in the neutral part of the Gulf of Finland. According to international law, cargo ships cannot carry more than twelve passengers. The Estonian authorities specially allowed the German residents to ride on this ship, but each person had to bring a life jacket, and another salvage ship followed. This shows the enthusiasm of the Germans for voting. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Reactions from European Countries: France Fears for the Future of the Treaties, Italy Believes Hitler Can Moderate, Geneva Holds the Same View, but Austria Still Enforces Martial Law</h3>
<p>(Paris) French people feel worried about the future of the Treaty of Versailles and other treaties. Some believe that nine out of ten German people have approved policies that could lead to a major war and various plans that violate civilized principles. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The result of the German election is not surprising. What is surprising is that 5% of Germans dared to openly vote against the National Socialist Party. British and French people believe that Hitler would inevitably win a majority, but Vienna believes that if the vote were free, Hitler would not be able to get half of the votes. Austrian officials fear the outbreak of the National Socialist Party within the country, and martial law is still being strictly enforced. Italians view the rise of the National Socialist Party as a victory for Fascism and believe that Hitler will now show a moderate posture so that the Geneva Disarmament Conference can be reopened. People in Geneva also hold the same view. The British Daily Express stated that Hitler can now act as a politician who expects disarmament and peace, rather than a politician who seeks votes. The Times published a letter from Lord Lothian, saying that we must understand the German point of view, otherwise Europe will be divided into two opposing military camps. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Newspapers in Various Countries Consider It Not Surprising, Pay Attention to the Attitude of Berlin and Rome</h3>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers commenting on the German election expressed disappointment, saying that the vanity of the German Empire, which had disappeared in the Great War, is now gradually reviving. Le Matin even advocated that France occupy Germany to prevent another war. One opinion believes that Hitler's peace rhetoric on Friday was directed at Britain and Italy, fearing that Italy might lean towards Berlin and abandon Geneva. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning, newspapers mostly adopted a reserved attitude towards the results of the German election, believing that this result was expected and not surprising. What France should pay attention to is not here, but in the future actions of Chancellor Hitler. The result of the referendum may allow Hitler to abandon his waiting policy and take a proactive attitude. Therefore, French newspapers are all taking a wait-and-see attitude, saying that all news from Berlin and Rome in the future should be closely watched. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers never immediately comment on major events. This time, the same is true for the results of the German election. Various major newspapers commented on the Labor Party's disarmament motion, which will be discussed in the House of Commons today. However, The Times commented that Germany's policy of withdrawing from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference has recently been reiterated. In addition, the National Socialist Party will be able to consolidate its position through this election. The Daily Herald said that the German referendum has given Hitler power, and from now on, his foreign policy will be more powerful. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Brussels Regarding the results of the German referendum, the newspapers here have only made brief comments so far. The newspapers all said that the results of the vote were not difficult to predict, so they did not attract attention. What is noteworthy is what attitude Hitler will now take. Le Peuple Belge speculated that Hitler would reiterate the demand that other countries must disarm, but if other countries implement this disarmament, it would be equivalent to suicide. The Socialist Party's organ, Le Peuple, regarded the German election as a "superficial joy" and hoped it would not be taken seriously. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Prague The newspapers published as usual on Monday commented on the results of the German election as unremarkable. For example, the Czechoslovak Daily said that the results of this election were not surprising. What was surprising was that there were still two million Germans who dared to say "No." The Monday Report did not believe that the results of this election were due to coercion, because the election campaign had caused German public opinion to lose its true face, resulting in this kind of expression. The newspapers all said that the development of future events must be carefully observed. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Vienna The Sunday and Monday newspapers commented on the results of the German election, briefly saying that "the question that should be put to the people for a vote is not the principle of equality of rights, but the method used to implement this principle. Now Hitler is deliberately evading seeking the opinions of the people on his strategies that are enough to cause trouble. This kind of election has no effect on foreign countries. Hitler may issue a new announcement requesting the implementation of equality of rights within the scope of the new international federation and the new Big Four conference. Political circles rumored that Prussian Prime Minister Goering had submitted this plan to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, who made slight modifications and did not want to make any prior statements to bind his final decision." The newspaper concluded by saying that the issue of arms inspection is the cornerstone of all international talks. The Sunday Report said that Germany has become a "confined area" with no freedom. Although 90% of the votes support the government, it is not credible. The conclusion then asked whether Hitler can fulfill his promise of "reconciliation" to the outside world. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Italy and Hungary Take a Sideline Position on Disarmament, Another Blow to the Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Hungary followed Italy in giving a general reservation on all the work of the Committee on Strength. This is the second major blow suffered by the Disarmament Conference since Germany's withdrawal. When the Committee on Strength met this morning, the Italian representative reiterated Italy's opposition to the procedures, and Hungary immediately stood up to declare that the Hungarian government agreed with Italy's position. Therefore, Italy and Hungary both stated that although they would not withdraw from the conference at this time, they would only participate in a listening capacity and would contribute very few opinions. (National News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Yesterday, the Italian delegation to the Disarmament Conference announced that Italian representatives would only be in a bystander position at the Disarmament Conference in the future. Le Temps commented on this matter, saying that the different interpretations of Italy's reserved attitude toward the Disarmament Conference vary. The newspaper said, "Some believe that Italy's attitude is to adopt a purely bystander attitude towards the future work of the Disarmament Conference. Others believe that Italy will not bear any responsibility for the various measures taken by the Disarmament Conference in the future when the German representative is not present, and from this, it can be concluded that Italy is directly or indirectly supporting Germany. Ultimately, what happened yesterday cannot be considered that Italy has this intention." Le Temps believes that Italy is actually planning for itself. Italy intends to cooperate with Britain and France on the one hand, and hopes to maintain friendly relations with Germany on the other hand, but this is not easy. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Polish Public Opinion Believes It Is Harmless to Themselves, Always Seeking Direct Negotiations with Germany</h3>
<p>Warsaw On the day after the German election, Polish public opinion was quite silent. Generally, Poland has always sought to deal with various issues directly with Germany. Since Poland has this intention, it is better to negotiate with a strong government supported by the whole country than to negotiate with a government that is about to leave. Therefore, the continued maintenance of a strong government in Germany is not regarded here as harmful to Poland's interests. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Belgian Socialists Demonstrate Against Fascism, Vandervelde Criticizes Germany for Lack of Freedom</h3>
<p>Brussels The Socialist Party originally planned to hold a demonstration in Malmedy (formerly German territory, now Belgian) to support peace and oppose National Socialism. However, because demonstrations were prohibited there, it was changed to nearby Dermont. Young officers wearing uniforms marched in teams. The leader of the Second International, Vandervelde, delivered a speech, saying that there is no freedom once one enters Germany. He then vehemently attacked the Treaty of Versailles and exposed the "fraudulent pan-Germanism" that has recently appeared in Belgium. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>15th Anniversary of the Austrian Republic, Socialist Parade Dispersed</h3>
<p>Vienna Today is the 15th anniversary of the Republic of Austria. Vienna and other places have passed peacefully. Only the Socialists held a parade in Vienna, but it was eventually dispersed by the police with clubs. As a result, the Vice President of the Austrian Socialist Party, Taler, was injured, and forty of his subordinates were arrested. The Austrian government prohibited any groups from holding meetings to celebrate because of the German general election that day. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Abrupt Change in US-Russian Negotiations, Roosevelt Thoroughly Resolves Various Outstanding Issues, Litvinov Consults with Moscow</h3>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt and Russian representative Litvinov discussed an extension. This is a sign that the United States is thoroughly studying various outstanding issues between the US and Russia before recognizing Soviet Russia. The New York Times quoted a White House dispatch saying that President Roosevelt now insists on obtaining a thorough understanding of various important issues. Another report said that the Soviet Union will propose compensation for Russian losses arising from the US intervention in Archangel and Siberia in 1919, the amount of which will exceed the total amount of Russian debts to the US and private US loans to Russia. It is said that Litvinov expressed surprise at the abrupt change in the situation and is consulting with Moscow on the debt issue. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) US President Roosevelt summoned Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov temporarily tonight for a two-and-a-half-hour talk, but still failed to produce concrete results. Tonight, Litvinov suddenly received a phone call from the President's Secretary at a banquet at the home of Agriculture Readjustment Officer Morganthau, inviting him to the White House at nine o'clock. Litvinov hurriedly finished the banquet and rushed to the White House, where he had a secret talk with the President and Undersecretary of State Bullitt for two and a half hours. When Litvinov left the White House at 11:25, he told reporters that no concrete results had yet been produced and that talks would continue. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Aircraft Conduct Another Long-Distance Exercise, One Aircraft Crashes into the Sea, Two Mechanics Injured</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tateyama Naval Air Corps in Chiba Prefecture has not yet made a long-distance flight to the north. This time, in order to prepare for the defense of the Northeast coastline, it was decided to dispatch several seaplanes to the Nemuro Naval Air Base in Hokkaido in late December to train for long-distance round-trip flights. This route is to defend against the US naval and air forces departing from Alaska, attacking Japan via the Kuril Islands, and to defend against the important air routes from Vladivostok and the North Sea Islands to Japan. (China United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 2:30 this afternoon, the Japanese naval aircraft carrier Akagi was conducting exercises on the waters of Matsushima. One aircraft crashed into the sea, the aircraft was destroyed, and three mechanics were injured, but they have been rescued. (China United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Discusses Economic Issues with Confidants, Inflationists Also Hold Regular Meetings</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US President met with his most trusted advisors this afternoon on various issues, such as Treasury Secretary Woodin, Reconstruction Finance Corporation President Jones, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Black, New York Federal Reserve Bank President Harrison, Agriculture Readjustment Officer Morganthau, Treasury Special Financial Advisor New York Powell, Savings Bank President Berle, and Professor Warren, the President's most trusted expert in recent times. It is said that they thoroughly studied the current situation of international gold and domestic prices for a long time, but none of them were willing to disclose the content. While the President was discussing the gold purchase policy, Senator Thomas, the leader of the congressional inflationists, also issued a notice inviting many political, industrial, commercial, and agricultural leaders to meet on Friday to discuss and determine the reform of monetary policy for submission after Congress convenes. According to Thomas, the purpose of the meeting is to discuss a plan to stipulate a sound gold standard for currency so that the amount of bank deposits and credit in 1926 can be restored, and to consider the appropriate position of silver in expanding the gold standard in order to submit it to Congress. According to his personal opinion, the price of gold should be raised to twice the statutory value of US$20.67 per ounce (i.e., the value of gold dollars should be reduced by half) so that it can assist in providing an appropriate currency to meet the needs of the whole country. At that time, Senator Pittman, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Harrison, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Senators Wheeler and Borah will all attend. (National News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government announced today that it will lend $37 million to farmers, using cotton as collateral, with each pound borrowed at four cents. This is the latest step in the rural relief plan to reduce cotton production. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Chaos in Cuba, Streets Deserted, New Rebellion Brewing, Dissatisfaction with the US Ambassador</h3>
<p>Havana The Chinese Consul-General in Cuba, because Chinese residences have been repeatedly violated in the recent riots, has requested the Cuban army to provide protection. The war spread to the Jewish residential area, and four Polish Jews were killed. The situation in Havana was generally calm today, with deserted streets, except for soldiers patrolling back and forth on motorcycles. If any rebels are found hiding on the roofs and terraces, they will be shot. The bombs used by the ABC party destroyed several houses. It is generally believed that none of the rebels will be executed. Civilians captured by the army will be released. Newspapers in the capital reported that government troops continued to actively suppress the rebels in the Damano area of the Eastern Province. Some people here said that the riots last Wednesday ended with the government troops recapturing the Atarés Fortress. About 200 people died in this battle, and the number of wounded and captured was extremely high. Hospitals and prisons are full. Cuban officials said that a new rebellion is brewing and that the government is on guard, and once it is launched, it will be severely suppressed. Cuban people believe that the current calm is like the silence before the storm. It is rumored that the leader of the opposition party, former President Menocal, is the leader of 5,000 rebels. The Ministry of Interior denied this today. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Havana Cuban supporters of the San Martín government today demanded the recall of US Ambassador Welles, accusing Welles of fueling the riots last week in Cuba, claiming that if friendly relations between the two countries are to be maintained, the United States has an absolute need to recall Welles. For example, Capo, the publisher of a well-known newspaper here, claimed that Welles had daily secret consultations with the leaders of the current revolution and their followers, advising them to re-support de Céspedes as president. The Alma Mater newspaper published by students of the National University also had the same tone. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Havana Last Wednesday, 2,000 soldiers under former President Cespedes raised the flag of revolution. The total number of dead and wounded was announced today, with more than 200 dead and hundreds injured, causing the hospitals in the city to be overcrowded. At the same time, the prisons are also full, because the rebels have been forced to surrender and are being detained. It is said that there were no casualties among British residents. The momentum of the revolution seems to have calmed down, but public sentiment is still high, and shootings occur from the roofs from time to time. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Navy Will Establish Special Service Agencies in China to Investigate Military Matters Along the Coast and Contact with the Country</h3>
<p>(China United Press Tokyo Dispatch) According to information from the Japanese Navy, naval authorities believe that the crisis in 1935 and 1936 will occur in the Pacific. At that time, the Chinese coast will be an important battlefield. Because the army established special service agencies in various places in the Northeast Provinces before the September 18th Incident, collecting military intelligence extensively, the military was very smooth after the September 18th Incident. The navy's military actions failed due to incomplete intelligence agencies, resulting in criticism from China and foreign countries in the Shanghai War. Therefore, it will establish a new special service agency in Shanghai, and place special commissioners in various important places along our coast to be responsible for intelligence and military liaison. The first director of the agency will be Captain Kitaoka, the captain of the warship Kirishima. Kitaoka will be promoted to Rear Admiral on November 15 and will be ordered to serve in the Third Fleet.</p>

His wife recently received a letter from the kidnappers demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan, and only then did she know that her husband had been kidnapped. The reason why the kidnappers demanded a 10,000 yuan ransom was based on the gold teeth that Grafsov was wearing. Grafsov had ten gold teeth, and his wealth was estimated according to the number of his teeth, with each one counted as one thousand yuan, so the ransom of 10,000 yuan was demanded.

<h3>Okamura Departs from Beiping for Tianjin; Okamura Speaks Highly of Maintaining East Asian Peace, Stating Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations Are Improving</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Okamura, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, arrived in Beiping a few days ago to negotiate various diplomatic issues with the North China authorities. At 8:25 AM on the 10th, accompanied by Col. Kita Seiichi, Staff Officer Hanawa, Secretary Gihei Hanawa, Aide-de-Camp Izumi, and others, he left Beiping for Tianjin to meet Yu Xuezhong. Japanese Embassy military attaché Tsukiyama and Nemoto accompanied him in the same car. Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, who had previously been summoned by Huang Fu from Tianjin to Beiping to participate in negotiations with Okamura on the issue of the Beining Railway's reopening, returned to Tianjin with Okamura in a special car on the morning of the 10th after completing his official business. Those who saw him off at the station included Yin Rugeng, Lei Shourong, Yu Jinhe, Zhu Shiqin, Japanese Secretary Nakayama, and embassy staff. Okamura was scheduled to arrive in Tianjin at 11:00 AM, rest at the Japanese barracks, and visit Yu Xuezhong at the provincial government at 2:00 PM. On the morning of the 11th, he will take a Japanese military plane from Tianjin back to Jinzhou, and then take a train to Changchun to report. Before leaving, Okamura issued a statement as follows: "I was ordered to come to Beiping this time to negotiate with Chairman Huang and Minister He on the three issues of returning the passes of the Great Wall in the North China war zone, establishing customs, and reopening the Beining Railway. After both sides exchanged views, the final result was a general agreement on the principles. The detailed implementation measures must be further studied by various experts before they can be decided, which cannot be resolved in a short period of time. Regarding the customs issue, it is necessary for financial experts to be responsible for the progress. The traffic issue also requires careful consultation by transportation experts. The result of the negotiations is very close to being satisfactory. Regarding my feelings about Sino-Japanese diplomacy, I believe that China and Japan are geographically connected and interdependent. The people of both countries should treat each other sincerely to jointly maintain East Asian peace. I believe that the recent environment in China and Japan is gradually improving for diplomatic relations. I will arrive in Tianjin this afternoon and plan to visit Chairman Yu Xuezhong at the provincial government at 2:00 PM, which is not a task, but a courtesy visit. I will stay in Tianjin for one day, and tomorrow morning (the 11th), I will take a Japanese military plane with my four companions back to Jinzhou, and then transfer to a train to Shenyang, and then return to Changchun to report."</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM on the 10th, Okamura and his party arrived in Tianjin. Twenty Japanese soldiers took a car to the station to welcome them. The Chinese side also sent police to the station to be on strict guard. After getting off the train, Okamura took a car prepared by the Japanese soldiers to the Yamato Hotel in the Japanese concession to rest. Nakamura, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, and Japanese Consul Tanaka called on him at the hotel. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, Okamura went to the provincial government to meet with Yu Xuezhong. He left after talking for twenty minutes. Okamura is scheduled to fly back to Changchun on the 11th, but it is uncertain whether it will be possible.</p>
<p>Regarding the unresolved incidents in the North China war zone, after Okamura met with Chairman Huang and He, a considerable range has been agreed upon regarding the principles of implementation. In the future, China and Japan will proceed according to this range. The incidents are divided into three categories: (1) The issue of reopening the Beining Railway. Because the internal and external routes originally belonged to the Beining Railway, the authorities have determined a method of reopening the railway in accordance with our principles, and transferred it to the Kwantung Army. If they agree, it can be realized in the short term. Okamura has already carried this method to Tianjin yesterday, and will transfer it to the Kwantung Army authorities after arriving in Changchun. In the future, in terms of progress, Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, will negotiate with the Japanese Embassy under the assistance of Xia Guangyu, counselor of the Ministry of Railways. For the convenience of the Kwantung Army, all incidents in the future will be handled entirely by the Japanese Embassy. (2) The establishment of customs at the passes of the Great Wall. The former Northeast customs were located in Yingkou, Binjiang, and other places. Now that they cannot exercise their functions, it does not seem appropriate to move them to the passes of the Great Wall. Therefore, the scope of discussion on this matter is to temporarily move the Yingkou, Binjiang, and other customs to the rear to handle official business, not to openly establish customs and collect taxes at the passes of the Great Wall. As for the customs established by the puppet state in Shanhaiguan, Gubeikou, and other places, they will not be recognized. (3) The return of the passes of the Great Wall and the withdrawal of the Japanese army. Since the Tanggu Agreement already has regulations, there is no problem. (11th)</p>
<h3>Tragic Situation in Bandit Areas of Sichuan Province; Refugees Displaced, Urgently Awaiting Relief; Also Begging for Bandit Suppression to Save the Remnants</h3>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: After the Sichuan bandits occupied Bazhong and Quxian, they ravaged the local area and massacred the people, which was extremely tragic. Now, the calls for help from the two counties are recorded below to show a glimpse.</p>
<h3>Bazhong</h3>
<p>To the Central Party Headquarters of Nanjing, the National Government, Chairman Chiang of the Military Commission, Ministers of Various Ministries and Courts, Supervisor Liu of Chengdu, Military Commander Deng, Military Commander Tian of Santai, Military Commander Yang of Shunqing, Commander-in-Chief Li of Suining, Commanders of various divisions and brigades, the Provincial Steering Committee of Chongqing, Steering Committees of various counties, and all newspapers and legal groups: Our Bazhong has fallen to the Red Bandits for ten months now. In these ten months, the people's houses and tombs have been burned, their assets have been robbed, their parents, brothers, wives, and children have been brutally killed, other social economy has been destroyed, and local construction has been ruined. The military's advances to suppress the bandits have been inconsistent, and the people's self-defense forces are limited in strength, resulting in the bandits' progressive advance and increasing rampant behavior. Initially, Tongnanba fell, and soon after, Yitucangguang was ravaged by them. Not long after, Nanpengyingqu was also disrupted by them. Considering the vast territory of our Sichuan, the bandits have occupied nearly three-tenths of it. In terms of terrain, they occupy the natural barrier of Bazhong Mountain by land and control the upper reaches of the Jiajiang River by water. The bandits have gained considerable momentum. If they are not surrounded and suppressed early, they will release the dragons into the deep abyss and let the fierce tigers escape into the swamps, which will inevitably evolve into the second Fujian and Jiangxi, which will be impossible to recover. The refugees have lost their homes and counties, and are wandering aimlessly. We lament that our homeland is far away and there is no hope of returning. We sigh at the displacement of our families. On October 15th, we established the Bazhong Refugee Group in Hechuan County to invite aid and rescue as a group. We believe that Sichuan has been in a cycle of internal warfare for years, and the armies are divided and self-governing, unable to cooperate. This bandit invasion has a great impact on the future of Sichuan. If they still maintain an attitude of watching the fire from the other side, there will be no intact eggs under the overturned nest. In addition, the national crisis is at hand, the foreign troubles are so urgent, and the internal chaos is so severe. Looking at the environment, we have no choice but to worry. All of you are either pillars of the country or hold important positions. Please work together with one heart and one mind to overcome difficulties and pool your efforts to eliminate boundaries. Immediately dispatch elite troops to encircle and attack, so that we can annihilate the ugly captives and restore our wounds. This is not only the fortune of our Bazhong, but also the fortune of Sichuan and the whole country. As for the refugees who have been displaced for a long time and have nowhere to go, we hope that you will show your compassion and grant funds for relief, so that the water will break the western river and revive the dried fish, and the benefits will spread to the lower villages and benefit all the mourning geese. We will be grateful without limit. We are in a hurry and hope you will consider it. Bazhong County Refugee Group Chairman Wang Zujun, Vice Chairman Zhang Shuoyan, Peng Jixian, and more than 5,600 refugees respectfully bow and print.</p>
<h3>Quxian</h3>
<p>(1) To the Commander-in-Chief of the bandit suppression, Commander Liu Gongjun: We, Quxian, are poor and the people are poor. This summer, drought has ravaged the area, and the fields are like burning. In the autumn, the grains have failed, and the rooms are empty. The drought-stricken area is vast, and the victims are everywhere. Just as we were raising funds for relief, the heavens were unmerciful, and the Red Bandits suddenly attacked our northern border of Quxian. In less than ten days, seven districts and thirty-six towns on the west bank of the Quxian River fell one after another. The residents fled to Liangzhu. The bandits were greedy and planned to invade the towns on the east side of Quxian River. Later, we heard that you, sir, had sent the Third and Fourth Division troops to our rescue, and the flames of the bandits began to subside slightly. However, of the more than forty towns in our Quxian that have not been lost, only a few towns in the east of the river remain. These towns are already crowded with refugees, and the food supply is almost exhausted. Recently, a large army has gathered, and the military rice is exhausted. As for those areas that have been reduced to bandit areas, the bandits arbitrarily search and kill when they come, and the petty thieves rise up when they leave, hoping that people will steal goods. People dare not live in peace and are displaced on the road. In addition, the severe frost is in September, the weather is cold, and the clothes are thin. The refugees who do not fall into starvation and cold and groan and turn to death are also few. Alas, our people have suffered terribly. If we do not appease them early, I am afraid that they will take risks. Then the towns on the east side of the river will no longer be ours. What a terrible future for half of eastern Sichuan. We believe that you, sir, have foresight and have already considered the art of assisting in the suppression. However, the institutions and legal groups are forced to be here and dare not remain silent. Therefore, we especially urge you, sir, to urgently send a large army to advance and suppress the bandits along the river, and to plow their yards and sweep their nests, so that the Quxian River can be protected and the Quxian territory can be safe. Then, take measures to appease them and do good in the future, so that the powerful will not gather and the old and weak can have a place to return. Then our hundreds of thousands of refugees in Quxian will worship your virtue of rebirth. There will be no end. We specially send a telegram to wait for your orders. Quxian agencies, legal groups, and refugees of the whole county bow and print. (2) To the Chairman of the Chengdu Relief Committee, Zhang Junjian: The Communists are rampant and have invaded the territory of Quxian. The houses, tombs, and properties of the people in the seven districts and thirty-six towns on the west side of the river have already been reduced to bandit nests and no longer exist. The towns on the east bank that have not fallen are places where refugees gather for food and military supplies. The remaining rations are also very scarce. If we delay for another month, the people of Quxian will have no food to eat. In addition to sending a telegram to request the bandit suppression troops to assist in the suppression, we especially urge your association to send personnel to Quxian to inspect the disaster situation and provide relief, so that the remaining victims can celebrate their rebirth. This is what we pray for. Quxian agencies, legal groups, and all the people of the county bow and print.</p>
<h3>Xiang Hanping Still Passive; Officers Under Xiang's Command Resign One After Another; Chen Zhangfu Also Suddenly Submits Resignation; Xiao Focheng Requests Leave to Go to Siam; Political Council Urges Li Zongren to Return to Guangdong</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Xiang Hanping, Commander of the Second Army of Guangdong, has been determined to resign since submitting his resignation twice. Yesterday, Xiang made a public speech, stating his intention to resign, saying that there was no other reason for this resignation. It was just that his energy was declining day by day and he was encountering setbacks, so he planned to recuperate. He himself had entered the military service in the fifth year of the Republic of China and has been in a state of worry and suffering for 17 years, causing him to suffer from mental anxiety. Looking back on more than ten years of hard work, he cannot defend the country or benefit his hometown. Asking himself, he feels ashamed, so he should retire and make way for the worthy and retire in time to cover up his previous mistakes. However, after resigning, he will definitely not leave Guangzhou and will not live in Hong Kong to avoid outside rumors, etc. After Xiang resigned, his subordinates were very disappointed. Since Zhang Meixin, the commander of the Fourth Division, was dismissed, Chen Jitang said that he would give him a better position, but Zhang turned a blind eye. Wu Jianhong, deputy commander of the Fourth Division, Li Yirong, commander of the 11th Regiment of the Fourth Division, and Chen Jing, commander of the 12th Regiment, have all followed Xiang for a long time. They also advance and retreat with Xiang and Zhang. They have already submitted their resignations at the Xin'an defense. Ye Minyu, the chief of staff acting in the military affairs of the Second Army, and Li Yukun, the chief of staff acting in the political affairs of the Pacification Office, also submitted their resignations one after another. Yesterday, Chen Jitang ordered them to continue to be responsible for handling official business until a suitable person was found to take over before approving the order. There is no need to discuss the resignation requested.</p>
<p>Recently, Chen Guofu, the Pacification Commissioner of the Southern District, and Xiao Focheng, a member of the Southwest Political Council, also passively followed Xiang. After Chen's resignation was submitted, he was retained from the order, and the resignation should be cancelled. Chen requested leave, and although the Political Council tried hard to retain him, he decided to go to Siam next month. According to Xiao, his trip to Siam was because the recent civil strife in Siam had affected the business he was running in Siam, and he urgently needed to manage the accounts. Secondly, his family members have relations with the Siamese people. Now that Siam has undergone changes, he must go home to inspect. He will leave at the latest next month, etc. The Southwest Political Council believed that Xiao's return to Siam would affect affairs, so it tried its best to retain Xiao and postpone his departure from Guangdong. At the same time, it telegraphed Li Zongren in Guilin to return to Guangzhou to preside over the public affairs of the Political Council. It is said that Li has agreed to leave for Guangdong after receiving the telegram, and will arrive around the daytime. (November 7)</p>
<h3>Hubei Provincial Party Department Criticizes Meng Guangpeng; Sends Letter to Provincial Government Recounting Meng's Mistakes; Orders County Party Departments to Supervise Local Governments</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hubei Provincial Party Department of the Kuomintang recently accused Huang Danchu, the magistrate of Huangmei County, of violating the law and dereliction of duty. Due to improper procedures, he was insulted by Meng Guangpeng, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. A misunderstanding has occurred between the party and the government. Now, Central Inspector Yu Xilai is mediating, and there is hope of explanation. However, the Provincial Party Department believes that this is of great importance. Yesterday, it sent another letter to the Provincial Government, criticizing Meng Guangpeng for his erroneous actions, and ordered the County Party Department to continue to be responsible for supervising the local government and not to show any favoritism. The letter and order are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Letter to the Provincial Government</h3>
<p>The general idea is to criticize Meng Guangpeng for five points: (1) The case of Huangmei County Party Department accusing the county magistrate of Huangmei County, Huang Danchu, has been concluded. Meng Guangpeng actually violated the original order of your government and ordered the lower authorities to post notices all over the city and countryside regarding this matter that should not have been announced and has already been concluded. At a time when heresies are rampant, the department actually allowed an administrative organ under the rule of the party to openly insult the Party Department. Meng Guangpeng is also an administrative official serving under the rule of the party. He publicly insulted the Party Department at will. For the sake of the future of the party rule, we are deeply worried. (2) The Central Government has repeatedly resolved that political officials must be party members. Meng Guangpeng has not transferred his registration to the Party Department under our association. It is impossible to find out whether he is a party member. Even if he is not a party member, since he is a political official under the rule of the party, he has the obligation to abide by and obey the general rules of our party. Now he is ordering his subordinates to insult the Party Department at will and announce the mistakes of the lower-level Party Department to the non-party masses. It is obvious that he has violated party discipline. (3) According to the Outline of Political Tutelage, the Provisional Constitution, and the Plan for Party Affairs During the Period of Political Tutelage, during the period of political tutelage, our party represents the people in exercising central rule, and the same level of Party Department has the power to supervise and report on the use of personnel, administration, and judiciary of the same level of government and its measures when it believes they are inappropriate. Therefore, the Huangmei County Party Department's accusation of the county magistrate is not inappropriate in principle. The only mistake is the procedure of the accusation. However, the notice sternly reprimands. It also disregards all political tutelage laws and regulations and seizes all the rewards and punishments of our association. (4) The original text of the notice quotes the eighth provision of the Provisional Outline for Party Affairs in the Bandit Suppression Areas of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and concludes that the Huangmei County Party Department is interfering in local administration. I do not know that although the above-mentioned outline states in the eighth provision that the Party Department or party members shall not interfere in local administrative or judicial affairs in the name of the Party Department or party members, the following text states that if a public official violates the law or is derelict in duty, he may collect factual evidence and transfer it to the headquarters or the provincial government for verification and handling by the County Party Department. Meng Guangpeng actually took the meaning out of context and made a far-fetched interpretation of the word "interference" in order to achieve his own goal of insulting. (5) All cases requesting instructions from higher-level agencies for verification and approval cannot be handled without authorization before the higher-level agencies have approved and decided. The original text of the notice reiterates the ban, but it is only a suggestion from your government to the higher-level agency. The department went ahead and reiterated the ban before the agency to which it was submitted had approved it. If it is not to despise the higher-level agency, it is to insult our association. In addition to submitting a report to the Central Government and the Nanchang Camp of the Military Commission for punishment according to law, it is appropriate to list the circumstances and state the reasons for the letter to your government, etc.</p>
<h3>Orders to County Party Departments</h3>
<p>"The case is that the 151st meeting of our association found that Article 8 of the Provisional Outline for Party Affairs in the Bandit Suppression Areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui states that the county party departments shall not deal with external affairs in the name of the party department or party members, especially shall not interfere in local administrative and judicial events in the name of the party department or party members. This kind of regulation is due to the fact that the working methods of our party tend to be secretive, and the intention is very good, but the Kuomintang of China represents the people in exercising the four powers during the period of political tutelage, so the party departments at all levels have the authority to supervise the administration of the governments at the same level. It is proposed to notify the county party departments to secretly supervise the measures of the local government, and if there is any violation of the party's ideology or corruption, they must collect evidence and secretly report it to our association, and transfer it to the provincial government for verification and handling. Is it appropriate? Please decide the case. The resolution was passed and recorded. Check that the party and the government have their own systems, and they must not directly interfere in local administrative justice in the name of the party department or individual party members, or directly submit them to the superior agencies in charge, and the previous decree has been complied with and recorded. However, our party is in the period of political tutelage, training the people to exercise the four powers. Before the people know how to use them, and before our party has authorized the people, if any violation of the party's doctrine or corruption occurs, we must collect accurate evidence and secretly report it to our association for verification and handling. We must not show any favoritism or act impulsively, so as not to cause criticism from outsiders and violate party discipline. This order." (11th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Buddhist Association Holds Inaugural Meeting</h3>
<p>Buddhist monks from various temples in Songjiang, believing that Buddhist associations have been established in various places, and that there are many monks in Songjiang, and that the organization cannot be delayed, were prepared by Monk Biyun of Puzhao Temple, which has been several months. The inaugural meeting was held on the 12th. Ninety-three representatives attended. Local lay Buddhists such as Wu Bogeng also participated. Biyun was elected chairman, and announced the preparations. Then monks Biyun, Yuanlin, Wuchao, and Xingpei, and laymen Wu Bogeng, Cai Zhongyu, Wu Renfu, and Yang Zhimin were elected as executive and supervisory members. After the election, the meeting adjourned and immediately reported to the General Assembly for the record.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Zhujiage Fire Brigade Established</h3>
<p>The Zhujiage United Fire Association in this county was ordered by the County Party Department to reorganize. The association immediately followed the law to organize a preparatory committee to start preparations, and renamed it Zhujiage Fire Brigade. It immediately drafted a simple charter and submitted it for approval by the County Party Department. On the 10th, the inaugural meeting was held in the auditorium of the Chamber of Commerce. More than 30 people, including Shen Shiru, attended. The County Party Department sent Lu Huiren to guide and supervise the election. Gao Yingjia was elected chairman to report on the preparations.

<h3>Chenqiao Town in Nantong Looted by Bandits</h3>

<h3>Complex Details of Robbery Case in Suzhou City</h3>
<p>A major robbery case involving three families occurred at No. 10, Heng Street, Songxiansha Lane in the city. The main suspects, Tang Yingqi, Zhu Xiangsheng, and Zhang Riyan, have been escorted by the Public Security Bureau to the local court for interrogation. Yesterday (the 13th), Prosecutor Shen Bingrong opened court for investigation. In addition to the three suspects, the victims and neighbors were summoned to conduct a detailed inquiry. Because Tang Kang and the other two were suspected of orchestrating the robbery, they were detained, and the others were ordered to return home. The authorities are also strictly pursuing the other robbers for further investigation. Tang Yingqi is the son of Tang Shao, the manager of Xiangda Foreign Goods Store in the West Central Market. Because of his dissolute behavior, his father had already published a statement disowning him. It is said that this time, due to his heavy debt, he had a bizarre idea and committed this major robbery. The details of the case are very complicated, and the court is currently conducting a detailed investigation.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at Gan Shen Silk Factory in Wuxi Resolved</h3>
<p>The Gan Shen Silk Factory under the Gongyun Bridge has a total of twenty silk reeling machines, twelve upstairs with 312 units, and eight downstairs with 208 units, employing approximately 1,500 female workers. Recently, the female workers on the last six of the twelve upstairs machines felt that the factory's requirements for re-reeling silk, re-reeling blackboards, and inspecting blackboards were too strict, making the work difficult. As a result, they gathered and discussed demanding improvements from the factory. Among them, the female workers of the last six machines, numbers 391, were the most determined. However, their gathering was unofficial, and they did not make a formal request to the factory. Therefore, the factory did not pay attention. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 12th), the female workers of the last six machines suddenly went on strike, and the strike spread to the first six machines, engulfing all twelve machines in the turmoil. Immediately, the female workers of the twelve machines gathered in the Changkangli area, creating a noisy and chaotic scene. However, the other workers arrived at the factory on time, but there was no work for them to do. Zhong Bingyuan and Hua Yongli, the factory's general managers, immediately went to the Changkangli area to persuade the workers and inquire about the reasons for the strike. The female workers demanded the cancellation of the re-reeling silk, re-reeling blackboards, and inspecting blackboards. They refused to return to work until their demands were met. Zhong and Hua returned to the factory to report after their persuasion failed. At around 4 a.m., Cheng Wenruo and Gai Weixian, the factory's work directors, convened a meeting with representatives of the female workers to mediate. The female workers still demanded the above two items, but the factory firmly refused. After repeated discussions, the factory only agreed to change the passing score for the existing blackboard inspection from 70 to 65, while the other requirements would remain unchanged. The labor side remained dissatisfied, and the meeting ended without a resolution. Yesterday (the 11th) at 5 p.m., the factory, as usual, sounded the whistle for work, but the female workers still gathered at the factory gate and did not enter to work. Fortunately, Chen Guangyuan and other machine supervisors from the factory immediately came forward and persuaded them with kind words to return to work to avoid unnecessary losses. At around 6 p.m., the female workers entered to work, and the strike was completely resolved.</p>

I hope you are well and happy. Before, I mentioned to you in Shanghai that the three places of Taihe, Yingshang, and Fuyang in our province were afflicted by bandits, and the suffering of the victims was very painful. Upon returning, I spoke about this with my friend (Jia Hui Ji), who was moved with compassion and is willing to donate 100 yuan to each of the disaster areas in the three counties. I know that a drop in the bucket is of little use, but saving one more life is a kind heart. I am sending this on behalf of my friend. Please have someone collect it and issue a receipt, and allocate it specifically to the victims of the three counties of Ying, Tai, and Fu in our province. I earnestly pray that you will transfer the funds to the disaster area. Thank you very much. (Omitted below)." Wu Fan, Qingdao, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Du Yuesheng Gave Sun Tonggang an Airplane Yesterday; Encouraging the Promotion of Aviation and Wishing Him Success on His Long-Distance Flight; Mr. Sun Came to Shanghai from Jinan Specifically to Accept It; Reportedly Staying in Shanghai for a Week Before Returning to Jinan</h3>
<p>Du Yuesheng is encouraging Chinese youth aviator Sun Tonggang to promote aviation for the sake of national development. He has specially purchased an aircraft and given it to Mr. Sun. The aircraft has now been assembled in Shanghai, and a presentation ceremony was held at the Hongqiao Airport in the city at 4 p.m. yesterday. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Celebrating Success</h3>
<p>Du Yuesheng spares no effort in all kinds of charitable causes for the Du Society, and he is particularly keen on promoting aviation to save the country. Mr. Sun Tonggang, a young Chinese aviator, returned to China in a self-provided aircraft from Germany and is now making a nationwide long-distance flight to promote aviation, which is highly commendable. Therefore, Du Yuesheng specially purchased an aircraft to give to Mr. Sun to encourage him and to celebrate his success in the long-distance flight.</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>In addition to Du Yuesheng and Sun Tonggang, the attendees at the presentation ceremony yesterday included Jin Xiaolin, Jin Tingsun, Yang Hu, Yang Zhixiong, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Qun, Wen Jiangang, and reporters, totaling about 100 people. Yang Xiaotian, the chief of the Shanghai Municipal Security Department, specially ordered a battalion of security guards under his command to be stationed along Hongqiao Road at about 2 p.m. yesterday to maintain order. Mr. Du Yuesheng (right) and Mr. Sun Tonggang (left) posing for a photo in front of the airplane (photo by Wang Kai).</p>
<h3>Aircraft Presentation</h3>
<p>The aircraft was completely assembled at about 1 p.m. yesterday and parked in the Hongqiao Airport. After Du, Sun, and others arrived, a French driver first drove the plane for a week of testing at the site. Then, Mr. Sun personally boarded the plane and flew for about five minutes, achieving excellent results. After Mr. Sun got off the plane, Mr. Du shook hands with him in front of the plane and said, "This aircraft is given to you. There will be no other ceremony. I hope you will continue to work hard to save the country through aviation." After he finished speaking, Mr. Sun bowed to Mr. Du to express his gratitude.</p>
<h3>Sun's Remarks</h3>
<p>The reporter from the Xinxin News Agency interviewed Mr. Sun at the airport yesterday. Mr. Sun said that he came to Shanghai today to accept the airplane presented by Mr. Du. The aircraft is made in France, has excellent machinery, and flies very fast. After obtaining this aircraft, he will definitely work harder and not disappoint Mr. Du and others' expectations. He also stated that he had made a nationwide long-distance flight this time, and he was warmly welcomed by the local agencies and people everywhere he went, for which he was deeply grateful. He was pleased that the entire Chinese nation now recognizes aviation as the only means to save the country and is promoting it. He plans to stay in Shanghai for a week and then fly the aircraft back to Jinan. He will decide when to go abroad to continue studying aviation after returning to Jinan. Wang Zuwen is currently staying in Jinan due to some matters, so he did not come with him. It is still undecided whether they will go to Germany together in the future. He added that the aircraft he flew back from Germany before, after making a nationwide long-distance flight this time, is currently parked in Jinan and will be given to the National Government in the future as a memento.</p>
<h3>Chen Jiliang Inspected the Ships Stationed in Shanghai Yesterday; Inspected YongSui and XianNing in the Morning; Inspected FuNing and SuiNing in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Chen Jiliang, Deputy Minister of Naval Affairs and Chairman of the Inspection Committee, went to Fujian and Nanjing one after another starting on the 12th of last month to inspect the stationed ships. He arrived in Shanghai on the Hai Chou ship last Saturday to inspect the ships and land-based agencies stationed in Shanghai. At 9:30 a.m. yesterday, Chen, accompanied by Tang Dexin, commander of the naval fleet, Yang Qingzhen, director of the Military Affairs Department, Lin Xianxin, director of the Ordnance Department, and others, inspected the YongSui and XianNing ships in the Gaochangmiao River. He returned to the Training Fleet Headquarters in the navy after noon for a rest. Starting at 2:30 p.m., he continued to inspect the FuNing and SuiNing ships in the Gaochangmiao River, completing the inspection by evening. He will inspect the Hai Rong and other ships starting today.</p>
<h3>Company Registration Requires Names of Parties Involved; Effective from the 16th of This Month</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified the trade associations yesterday, in order to issue a notice, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau instructed on the 10th of this month that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce instructed that company registration should be carried out by the parties concerned submitting a petition together with the required documents. When submitting a petition, the entrustment letter from the agent should be added. "The parties concerned" means "the company stamp and names of shareholders", it is clear. If the application is being submitted by a proxy an entrustment letter must be given alongside the original and the original must still bear the company chop and signatures of shareholders. But recently many have only submitted an entrustment letter without the signatures of shareholders, which is against what is expected. If an agent can apply without the signatures of shareholders or managers a false registration can occur, thus the government proposes to amend or remove the need of the proxy. Therefore the agency should be removed.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Railway Freight Car Derailed at Hepingmen Yesterday; Switchman Failed to Properly Set the Switch; Locomotive Water Tank and Freight Cars Derailed; Traffic Blocked Yesterday Morning and Afternoon; Repaired by 5 p.m.</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway's No. 331 down train derailed at Hepingmen Station in Nanjing at around midnight yesterday due to the switchman's failure to properly set the switch. The locomotive water tank and four freight cars derailed and fell into the ditch, blocking traffic in both directions. The line was fully restored by 5 p.m. yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Incident</h3>
<p>The No. 316 up freight train with 27 cars arrived at Hepingmen Station at 11:52 p.m. the night before last and parked on a side track to wait for the No. 331 down freight train from Beijing to meet. The No. 331 down train with 20 cars arrived at the station at 11:58 p.m., intending to pass through the straight track. Unexpectedly, the switchman failed to properly set the switch, and the water tank car, a 30-ton car carrying wounded soldiers, and three 40-ton cars derailed and fell into the ditch, completely blocking traffic.</p>
<h3>Post-Incident Arrangements</h3>
<p>After the accident, the stationmaster of Hepingmen immediately telegraphed for assistance. Upon receiving the news, the Beijing Station dispatched a shunting locomotive from Jiangbian Station at 0:40 a.m. yesterday to the scene of the accident, and towed the 15 freight cars that had not derailed from the rear of the train back to Nanjing at 1:37 a.m. The Beijing-based engineer, Min, supervised all the workers, and they took a rescue vehicle to Hepingmen Station at 2:07 a.m. to start work. The No. 316 up freight train that was parked on the curved track at the station was also moved back to Yaohuamen Station at 3:16 a.m.</p>
<h3>Passenger Trains Blocked</h3>
<p>The No. 6 up night train from Shanghai to Beijing arrived at Hepingmen Station at 6:50 a.m. yesterday. Most of the passengers got off at the station. The No. 302 through train and other trains were also delayed. The passengers who did not get off the No. 6 train at Hepingmen were picked up by a special train with three passenger cars sent by the Beijing Station, which arrived in Beijing at 7:55 a.m. Therefore, all passenger trains departing from Beijing yesterday morning were also blocked and temporarily delayed.</p>
<h3>Repair Work</h3>
<p>After the Beijing-based engineer, Min, and a large number of workers arrived at the Hepingmen Station, they rushed to clear the straight track and managed to complete the work by 11:45 a.m. yesterday, restoring traffic first. However, it was still impossible to turn trains, so the trains from Beijing to Shanghai were delayed by several hours. The side track was not repaired until 4:56 p.m.</p>
<h3>Injured Soldiers</h3>
<p>The four freight cars that derailed yesterday were all carrying wounded soldiers from the No. 9 Army Rear Hospital, who were being transported from Nanchang to Hangzhou for treatment. Fortunately, they were all lying in their bunks, so they were not injured again, but they were frightened.</p>
<h3>Investigating Responsibility</h3>
<p>Zheng Baozhao, the director of the Transportation Department of the railway, ordered Chen Zhongying and Miao Chaoyuan, the section chiefs of the Beijing-Shanghai section, to thoroughly investigate the responsible employees for punishment by the director's office.</p>
<h3>National Water and Land Joint Transportation Competition: Yu Qiaqing Strives for Private Shipping Industry, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Petitions Ministry of Transportation for Rejection</h3>
<p>After the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company undertook national water and land joint transportation, the Shanghai Shipping Association telegraphed the highest party, government, and military organs, earnestly requesting that private enterprises be allowed to undertake it simultaneously. Yu Qiaqing also, in his private capacity, telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to approve private participation in joint transportation. Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, yesterday petitioned the Ministry of Transportation to reject the Shipping Association's request. The detailed information is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing's Telegram to Chiang Kai-shek</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing's telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang reads: Respectful greetings to Chairman Chiang in Nanchang. I have received and carefully read your winter telegram. All shipping merchants are grateful for your complete support and respectfully express their thanks. Investigating the state's exclusive control of national transportation, this is the behavior of the Soviet Russian communist government. The Party and the nation oppose communism, and you, sir, suppress communism. Yet, the Ministry of Railways and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are adopting Soviet Russian policies. What is their intention? The entire nation deeply suspects and fears this, as it is not merely the shipping merchants who are grieving and indignant. Recalling that you, sir, have led the revolutionary army for seven years, in all expeditions and suppressions, river and sea transportation, commercial ships have always followed orders and enthusiastically responded to commands, without any delays. The facts are clear and have long been under your discerning gaze. Although everyone has a heart to support the central government, it is truly because they are moved by your spirit of striving for the people and relieving their suffering. Since the government nationalized the privately-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the people have harbored deep suspicions. However, the shipping merchants believed that with leadership, cooperation could be expected. In a country where the shipping industry is extremely young and shipping rights are being infringed upon, this might not be a policy to save and revitalize the industry. Therefore, their opposition was dissolved by hope. Initially, they did not expect that after becoming state-run, out of fear of foreign entities, they would first turn inward, using the power of the government to suppress private shipping, in countless ways. Now, they have become even more extreme, exclusively controlling the national water and land joint transportation, not allowing private enterprises to undertake it. This is simply using state-run enterprises to defeat private enterprises. With the full power of the state, defeating private shipping is easy to achieve. What is regrettable is that the government's reclaiming of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was originally intended to defeat private shipping, and this purpose has now been completely exposed. It is already difficult to prevent people from speaking, let alone control their hearts. Our country has a vast coastline, intricate rivers, and crisscrossing railways. Yet, wanting only the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, with its twenty-four ships, to exclusively control the joint transportation of eleven routes across the country, it is certain that the matter will fail. This can be stated with certainty. Even considering military transportation, is it not the same? Recently, communist bandits in Sichuan province fled downwards, and Chairman Liu dispatched troops to pursue and suppress them, urgently needing commercial ships like stars chasing fire. Yet, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company did not dispatch a single ship, resorting to renting and hiring foreign commercial ships, which were unwilling to respond to the call. The bandit forces easily spread, and the troops could not be transported. This is truly a time of national crisis, with profound military implications. Private shipping companies, with a determination to share joys and sorrows, heard the news and responded. More than ten private ships were prepared to alleviate our country's western concerns. This is the most recent fact that is more convincing than any eloquent argument. Those who fulfill their obligations should enjoy rights. Those who share sorrows should share joys. Moreover, the overall situation has not yet been fully stabilized, and sorrows are pressing. It is not the time for government groups, organizations, and the people to compete for rights and seek pleasure. Yet, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company avoids and retreats from military transportation, which involves sharing difficulties and fulfilling obligations, while exclusively controlling joint transportation, which involves having rights and gaining pleasure. If private shipping companies were to follow suit, the impact would not only delay your, sir, achievements, but also create a major obstacle to the future of communist suppression. This is inevitable, and the heart is filled with extreme worry. May I ask, can the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company exclusively control all national military transportation in the future without delaying our opportunities? Furthermore, investigating water and land joint transportation, it is truly the foundation for reclaiming shipping rights. The government and the people must thoroughly cooperate, with the state-run shipping industry bearing the responsibility of leadership and the private shipping industry undertaking the responsibility of collective support. Then, the connections will be smooth, and the strength will be great. It will not only be twice the result with half the effort, but the goal will also be easier to fully achieve. After repeated appeals from the shipping merchants, the Ministry of Railways initially allowed private shipping to join after the scale was established, then agreed to allow them to join gradually. However, it consistently refused simultaneous participation. After endless disputes, the Ministry of Railways granted the Three North Company the Xiang-E route, which the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company did not have ships to connect. On the surface, it slightly gave private enterprises a small favor, but in reality, it was still compensating for the shortcomings of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The perfunctory intention is clearly revealed. Among the national water and land joint transportation routes, the one with the most guaranteed business and profit is Haizhou. Initially, Japanese commercial ships operated the Haizhou to Shanghai route. Domestic merchants believed that inland shipping rights were being infringed upon again. Therefore, they successively organized the Hezhong and Dazhen companies, surveyed the seaport, built docks, purchased ships, and invested heavily, taking great risks. Their painstaking efforts were truly unique in our country's shipping industry. The government should protect and encourage them, to encourage those who open new routes. However, the Railway Bureau moved the Dapu Station to Laoyao, causing the company's docks and warehouses to be completely abandoned, wasting resources. The losses amounted to hundreds of thousands, and the suffering was already extremely deep. Now, they are not even allowed to participate in joint transportation, which is putting them in a dead end. Fortunately, the contracts between the Ministry of Railways and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and between the Longhai Railway and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, have not yet been signed. There is still hope for salvation. However, if you, sir, who saves the people from water and fire, do not come forward to preside over and rescue them, then the Ministry of Railways' preconceived notions will certainly not be changed. The timing is urgent, and I must make a painful appeal. In recent years, the measures taken by administrative officials have violated public opinion, countless times, and have greatly deviated from your, sir, principles. The people trust you deeply and expect much from you. Although you bear the responsibility of many wise men, I hope you will understand that you are acting on behalf of the people. My knowledge of your virtue has been long, plentiful, and detailed. I was just about to present it to you for your contribution. Now, because the refusal of private participation in water and land joint transportation has a great impact on the hearts of the people and military transportation, I dare not avoid criticism and resentment, and earnestly present this matter first. I implore you to quickly examine and verify it, and strive to rescue it. Please also telegram the Ministry of Railways to allow private shipping companies and state-run companies to undertake joint transportation simultaneously, in order to win back the hearts of the people and protect all private shipping. My sincere and straightforward words, I humbly pray for your kind consideration. In my telegram, I cannot express the urgency of waiting for your command. Yu Hede respectfully kowtows, Jiang.</p>
<h3>Chiang Replies to Yu Qiaqing, Liu Hongsheng Reports</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang replied to Yu Qiaqing's telegram, saying: To Mr. Yu Qiaqing in Shanghai, I have received and carefully read your telegram on behalf of the Jiang Dynasty. I have already telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to investigate and handle it. I am replying specifically, Chiang Chung-cheng, True, Xing Huiyin.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are handling water and land joint transportation, and the entire Shanghai private shipping company has risen up in opposition. The Shipping Association has submitted separate reports to the central departments and ministries, strongly accusing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company of monopolizing shipping and demanding that private commercial ships be included as well. This matter has been submitted by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to the central government, refuting the Shanghai Shipping Association's statements. Yesterday, at the bureau's memorial week, all bureau staff were convened, and Liu Hongsheng ordered You Zhijun to declare on his behalf, briefly stating that the bureau had already discussed joint transportation with the Ministry of Railways, which was still the proposal put forward by former bureau member Feng Mengyan. In the 20th year of the Republic (1931), when the Ministry of Railways held the 15th joint transportation meeting, the bureau sent staff to attend and drafted eleven articles of joint transportation outline. At the 16th joint transportation meeting, twenty articles of implementation measures were also coordinated. At that time, there was no mention of allowing private transportation to join. The Shanghai Shipping Association submitted reports to the central government, accusing the bureau of monopoly and making defamatory propaganda in the newspapers. They do not know that the bureau's handling of joint transportation has long been approved by Chairman Chiang. The sincerity of cooperation is fully demonstrated by renting Yuan'an, Zhaoxing, and Sanbei ships this time for private companies. All Shanghai Shipping Association representatives of various private shipping companies want to increase joint transportation. The bureau has submitted a report to the Ministry of Transportation, requesting that it be forwarded to the Executive Yuan for rejection, as recorded below.</p>
<h3>Document Submitted to the Ministry of Transportation</h3>
<p>Previously, your department ordered, forwarded by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's cold telegram, ordering the details of the Ministry of Railways' contact with the joint transportation method and the process, and reported for inspection and verification. In addition, if the Ministry of Railways allows the Sanbei Company to participate in the joint transportation, the bureau will not suffer great losses, and it will be inspected and reported. When I was trapped in the telegram, I briefly stated the reasons why private shipping could not join the joint transportation, and I was ordered by your department to "still report the joint transportation method to the ministry for review before handling it." In response to this, it was found that the bureau and the state-owned railways successively concluded a water and land joint transportation contract case in January of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), which was approved by the President of the National Government, Chiang, and handed over to the Executive Yuan for handling. The Secretary of the National Government Office wrote, "Approved by the Executive Yuan's letter," according to the Ministry of Railways' report, "Regarding the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's request to order the Longhai Railway Bureau to continue signing a formal water and land joint transportation contract, the railway bureaus and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should first discuss the outline of water and land joint transportation, and wait for the joint transportation conference to make a resolution, and then order them to comply with the implementation after the ministry approves it. "Wait for the situation, and obey the president's instructions." Correspondence copies are sent to the same original, and the letter reaches the investigation and follow-up. "In response to this, in March of the same year, the Ministry of Transportation ordered the Ministry of Railways to order the bureau to participate in the 15th National Joint Transportation Conference, and immediately dispatched personnel to participate in the joint discussion of twelve articles of the Joint Transportation Outline. In September of this year, the 16th National Joint Transportation Conference was sent to participate, and it was decided that the bureau and the state-owned railway's joint transportation measures would be 21 articles. Now, the Ministry of Railways Joint Transport is negotiating to formulate a water and land joint transportation contract. Once the negotiations have results, the contract will be formally signed, and the results of the previous meetings will be used to formulate detailed rules with the Longhai Railway Bureau and try to implement them by the day, so as to implement them. This is the process of the bureau and the Ministry of Railways discussing the water and land joint transportation contract. The Ministry of Railways has specially allowed the bureau to participate in the signing of the contract at previous water and land joint transportation conferences, so as to have the priority to undertake the right, but not other private shipping. The private shipping companies belonging to the Shanghai Shipping Association have more than 60 companies, and other scattered shipping companies in various ports are not included. If it is necessary to treat them equally, and allow them to join the joint transport together, and individually sign contracts, the situation is really difficult. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the only state-owned enterprise, with a long history and a mission from the government. It has its own warehouses and docks in various ports in China. The location is superior, the construction is suitable, the loading and unloading is convenient, and the transportation connection is not comparable to other shipping companies. The nature of the bureau and private shipping is different, and you should pay attention to your own behavior. Of course, you cannot force them to receive equal rights and obligations. However, state-run and private shipping both serve the country and society. Within the possible scope, there is no lack of mutual assistance opportunities. That is, for this water and land joint transportation, the bureau and other commercial shipping companies are not without related relationships and cooperation possibilities. When the Ministry of Railways and the bureau sign a contract to handle joint transportation, it is not absolutely forbidden for private shipping to participate. However, according to the original intention and the state-owned position, the bureau will directly undertake it first. In the future, if there is success or there is an opportunity to expand, the bureau will consider the situation and invite various related commercial ships to participate and jointly handle the joint transportation, so as to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation, and avoid the disadvantages of competition and squeezing. Then, the bureau will only summarize the success of the joint transportation, so as to fulfill the responsibility of undertaking and starting. Now, when the joint transportation starts, in addition to renovating the original docks and ports in various ports for application, on the one hand, it is purchasing and building the latest fast ships in Chinese and foreign factories, and on the other hand, it is adding rent and using suitable ships from private shipping companies for distribution to various routes, in order to prepare for the needs of joint transportation. In the future, the balance of goods carried by the bureau's ships can still be allocated by the bureau to private shipping companies. For example, for goods on the Wu-Chang route, the Sanbei Company has many ships, so it can be distributed to the Sanbei Company to undertake. For goods on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo route, it can be distributed to the Ning-Shao Company. For goods in the Northeast, it can be transferred to Zhaoxing and Zhengji ships for transportation, so as to facilitate facts and unify authority. Each industry does not have to sign a contract with the railway, and can cooperate with the bureau at any time. There is no intention to control and manipulate, and it is really awe-inspiring to the purpose of mutual assistance and cooperation. It is to maintain the intention of the government to protect private enterprises in the domestic shipping. However, the same industry has not fully understood the original intention of the Ministry of Railways and the bureau's contract this time, and believes that it is intentional to abandon and cut off its livelihood, causing doubts. Please help. I don't know that the measures and contracts discussed by the bureau and the Ministry of Railways are not only not violating the principle of the contract law, but also coinciding with the fate of the private shipping industry. Furthermore, if other shipping companies directly sign contracts with the railway after the start of joint transportation, not only will the freight rate be reduced, which will lead to a gradual increase in competition and a loss of the original intention of joint transportation, but also the bureau will add ships, docks, warehouses and other equipment for joint transportation, which will inevitably lead to the division of freight, resulting in insufficient cost. The amount of loss is unnecessary to say. Therefore, for water and land joint transportation, the bureau must first directly sign a contract with the Ministry of Railways to undertake it. This is the main reason. The previous cause of the order, in addition to the formal contract, shall be submitted after the signing, and the situation of the consultation and implementation, as well as the Joint Transportation Outline deliberated by the 15th National Joint Transportation Conference and the Joint Transportation Measures decided by the 16th National Joint Transportation Conference, shall be submitted to your department for inspection and verification. And please present and transmit to the Executive Yuan, and consult the Ministry of Railways, and quickly reject the request of the Shanghai Shipping Association, and instruct the Shanghai Shipping Association to forward to all members to comply. If the industry wants to participate in the joint transportation, they can directly contact the bureau for handling at any time, so as to be simple and convenient. Respectfully presented to the Ministry of Transportation, Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the State-owned Commercial Bureau.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson Stevedoring Labor Dispute Resolved: Salary Increase Conditions Signed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The stevedoring workers of Jardine Matheson Company, a British firm, demanded a salary increase and improved treatment. The labor union negotiated with the company based on the conditions put forward by the workers. The company expressed its acceptance, but the compradors also had various difficulties, which led to delays for many days and failed to be resolved, causing great disputes. It almost led to a second major strike, and the situation was quite serious. Later, Mr. Xie Baosheng came forward to mediate, and the opinions of both sides gradually approached. It was heard yesterday that the matter had been settled and the signing procedures were performed. The participants in the signing were worker representatives Lin Shengmao and others, comprador representative Shen Huating, Secretary Gu Dachun and Sun Lvping of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, and Wang Zhixiang of the Shanghai Branch. The provisions are recorded below: (1) Each stevedoring worker will receive an additional six yuan of ocean per month, starting from November 16th of this year. The provisional trial period is six months. (2) In the event of a shipwreck, the compradors and workers have the same interests. The comprador should consult with the labor union and request the company to handle it in accordance with maritime law. If the national salary rate of the workers is less than 650 yuan, the compensation shall not be less than 650 yuan. The loss of the survivors shall be 160 yuan, and the company shall be requested to give priority to filling their positions. (3) The annual double salary shall be completely cancelled and replaced by a three-day monthly promotion. (4) Any agreement made by the former Jardine Matheson Stevedoring Club and the comprador side that harms the interests of the workers shall be invalid. As for the method stipulated in Article 1, if the comprador side is sure that the treatment given by Jardine Matheson Company is insufficient to support the above-mentioned burden after six months, it may put forward strong evidence, and after the labor union investigates and approves it, it shall negotiate another relief method, so as to ensure that the comprador side does not feel the difficulty of making ends meet due to the salary increase. (3) Regarding the provisions of Article 3, those who have no double salary shall be decided by the work group leader of each ship and the comprador of the ship at the end of each year, according to the customs and the business situation of the year. If a dispute occurs, both parties shall invite the labor union and the shipping mutual aid association to resolve it impartially. (3) After the third annual double salary is changed to a three-day monthly promotion, the stevedoring workers shall have a specified annual leave, limited to one round trip, and the excess shall be deducted from their salary on a daily basis for the purpose of hiring substitutes. Those with special circumstances shall not be subject to this restriction if approved by the comprador. (4) If the company has not increased the salary for the comprador before the salary increase, the workers shall not make the same request.

<h3>Guangdong Fellow Association Appeals on Behalf of Qiongya Sugar Merchants, Submitting to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for Prompt Guarantee, Wang Xiaolai and Lu Feikui Also Support, Representative Xing Juefei Appeals to Beijing Again</h3>
<p>Qiongya native sugar exported to Shanghai has been repeatedly detained, punished, and confiscated by the Qiongjiang Customs, causing sugar merchants to suffer losses and bankruptcies, accounting for half of the total, and sugar farmers have lost their jobs, accounting for more than 100,000 people. The Qiongya authorities, seeing this crisis, came forward to maintain it, and organized an on-the-spot investigation team for native sugar, personally visited various places to investigate the truth. Now it has been found that the sugar detained in Shanghai is the same as the Shizilu sugar in Qiongshan County. Therefore, a report and a chart of native sugar have been compiled and handed over to Xing Juefei, the representative of the Qiongya Sugar Merchants and the representative of the Haikou Chamber of Commerce, to be presented to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for inspection and verification, so as to clarify the truth. Representative Xing Juefei had previously appealed to Beijing and had been received by President Wang, who promised to order the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to jointly verify and handle the matter to appease the people's livelihood. Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, also promised to protect merchants and farmers impartially within the scope of his duties. The Customs Department of the Ministry of Finance also made a phone call to summon Representative Xing to meet and inquire about everything. However, the Minister of Finance Song suddenly resigned when the matter was about to be handled, so the matter was suspended again. Representative Xing returned to Shanghai temporarily and appealed to the Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai, asking for assistance. Tang Haian, Chairman of the Association, Zheng Hongnian, Vice President, Wen Hongen and other directors also recognized the matter as a major issue for the sugar industry in South China, and agreed to forward the appeal to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, requesting prompt guarantee to appease the people's expectations and solve the crisis. The text of the presentation is recorded below, presenting the facts, allowing the Qiongya Sugar Merchants Representative Haikou Chamber of Commerce Representative Xing Juefei to send a letter stating that the agricultural products of our country have always been dominated by native sugar, etc. (omitted in the middle) It is appropriate to send a letter to inspect and verify, and allow the presentation to be forwarded, which is convenient for the industry. The letter has been received by the association. I think that Qiongya native sugar is the main product of the two counties, and the livelihood of Qiongya farmers and merchants is not shallow. It seems that it should be protected and maintained to maintain the livelihood of farmers and merchants. The letter should be approved and forwarded, and it is convenient for both public and moral. Respectfully presented to Kong, Minister of Finance, Chen, Minister of Industry, Tang Haian, Director of the Guangdong Travel Shanghai Fellow Association, and Zheng Hongnian, Vice Director. It is also heard that the Qiongya Alumni Association in Shanghai will hold a general meeting of members on the 19th of this month. Xing Juefei plans to come to Shanghai to attend the report and ask for assistance, but because the new Minister of Finance Kong Yongzhi has already officially taken office, the representative is anxious to return to Beijing again to appeal, hoping to resolve it as soon as possible, and Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and Lu Feikui, General Manager of the China Bookstore, have both sent letters of introduction to visit, requesting to speak freely, so as to obtain redress to relieve the difficulties of merchants and relieve the difficulties of farmers. Wang and Lu are enthusiastic about social undertakings. Now that Representative Xing is seeing the difficulties of more than 100,000 merchants and farmers in Qiongya who are coming to Beijing to appeal, they are sympathetic and have introduced them. This is also a piece of enthusiasm. I would like to report to the Alumni Association that Representative Wu Rong has been sent to attend the report on behalf of the Alumni Association, and the Alumni Association will definitely have a warm assistance at that time. It is also heard that the elders and celebrities of the Nalu eight counties of Guangdong Province in Shanghai, such as Li, Wan, Chen, and Wang, etc., also plan to convene a general meeting and send a telegram to support, hoping to promote the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to resolve the matter as soon as possible, so as to protect national products.</p>

<h3>After the Dayang Bridge Fire, Hengfeng Road Suffers a Major Disaster: Fire Started by a Knocked-Over Kerosene Lamp Igniting Straw; Over 70 Thatched Huts Destroyed in a Most Tragic Scene</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 11th), a major fire broke out in the poor people's thatched huts on the north bank of the Tanzi Bay near the Dayang Bridge in Zhabei, destroying more than 130 thatched huts. The victims had nowhere to turn, suffering from hunger and cold, a truly pitiable situation. Unexpectedly, one disaster follows another, the misfortune of the poor reaching its extreme, which is greatly lamentable. Yesterday morning, at about 2:15 AM, in the thatched huts along Guangzhao Road near the end of Hengfeng Road in Zhabei, a man named Zhang Wenjin from Taizhou, who worked as a laborer, shared a house with Zhang Zhengpeng, a Yangzhou man who worked as a rickshaw puller. After falling asleep, they forgot to extinguish the kerosene lamp. In a turn, the lamp was knocked over, and sparks ignited the straw in the house, causing an immediate fire. By the time the two were awakened from their sleep, the fire had spread to the entire house and to the neighboring houses. The weather was dry, making it even easier for the fire to spread. In a short time, more than ten houses were burned down. Nearby residents rushed to carry their old and young, and their broken quilts, fleeing in panic, shouting and screaming, causing great disorder. The 2nd Sub-precinct of the 4th District nearby received the news and immediately notified the Zhabei fire brigades to rush fire engines to the scene to put out the fire. At the same time, they dispatched senior police officers to the fire scene to maintain order. However, the fire was raging, and the thatched huts were densely packed, making it very easy to catch fire. Despite the efforts to put out the fire, no effect was seen. The firefighters surrounded the fire on all sides, vigorously spraying water, and trying to prevent it from spreading. But the fire continued to spread east and west, uncontrollably, with flames soaring and red light illuminating the sky. It was not until around 3:50 AM that the fire gradually died down. As a result, about 70 thatched huts were destroyed, affecting more than 80 households. Fortunately, the firefighters put out the fire effectively, preventing it from becoming a major disaster. More than 100 thatched huts in the rear were spared this calamity, otherwise, the situation would have been unimaginable. Zhang Wenjin and Zhang Zhengpeng, who started the fire, were taken to the 2nd Sub-precinct of the 4th District for questioning after the incident. As they passed the buck, they were temporarily detained, pending investigation.</p>

<h3>Xinguang Bookstore Smashed and People Injured Yesterday; Troublemakers Fled Without a Trace</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 3:50 PM, the Xinguang Bookstore at 88 Baike Road was suddenly smashed by many young people. They also carried a large amount of kerosene, hoping to set fire, but failed. The telephone line was also cut. By the time the police heard the alarm and went to arrest them, the crowd had already fled. As a result, one of the bookstore’s employees was beaten and injured. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Publishing Books and Newspapers</h3>
<p>Xinguang Bookstore, located at 88 Baike Road along the road, has been open for more than a year. In addition to publishing "Social News Tri-Weekly" and "Socialism Monthly," it also sells various books such as "New Life," "Modern Historical Materials," and "Our World." Although the scale is small, the circulation of the bookstore’s two publications is widespread, covering almost all parts of the country and abroad. The manager is Qian Luzhi from Zhejiang, and the bookstore only employs two or three employees.</p>
<h3>Causing Animosity</h3>
<p>The content of the bookstore’s two publications is entirely focused on exposing the conspiracies of reactionaries, thus causing animosity from the other side. The bookstore's organizers are also well aware of the danger of their situation. Therefore, in addition to setting up the bookstore on Baike Road, all editorial matters are set up in Nanshi, strictly keeping it secret from the outside world. Unexpectedly, at about 3:50 PM yesterday, twenty or thirty young people suddenly came and broke into the bookstore, wantonly smashing things.</p>
<h3>Young People Break In</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, twenty or thirty young men in Western suits, Zhongshan suits, and casual clothes suddenly appeared near Baike Road, Xizang Road. First, eight or nine people broke into the bookstore, claiming to buy textbooks. The remaining twenty or so people were waiting on both sides of the street outside the door. About five minutes later, the eight or nine people inside suddenly shouted loudly and raised chairs and benches to smash the bookshelves. The order was in great chaos. Those standing outside the door also shouted loudly in support.</p>
<h3>Wanton Destruction</h3>
<p>When they started, one person first cut the telephone line, and then wantonly smashed everything. At the same time, they distributed various leaflets with the words "Smash the Fascist Reactionary Newspaper丨丨Social News Agency," signed "□□ Youth League Jiangsu Provincial Committee, November 13," etc. Those waiting outside the door also poured kerosene on the gate of the bookstore, intending to set fire. Fortunately, the police had heard the news, but by the time a large number of detectives were dispatched and arrived, the crowd had already scattered and disappeared.</p>
<h3>Employee Slightly Injured</h3>
<p>During the chaos, one of the bookstore's employees was hit in the head by the crowd and injured. After the incident, the bookstore inspected the damage and found that six pieces of glass from the bookshelves and windows were broken, and many trees, chairs, and appliances were damaged. Two account books were also lost.</p>

<h3>Shocking: Wet Nurse Feeds Baby Needles; Holds Grudge After Being Fired and Asked to Return Wages; Baby Fortunately Not Dead After Three Needles Excreted</h3>
<p>Wu Fanglian, a judge in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, from Minhou, Fujian, whose style name is Ruichai, is 29 years old this year. His residence is located at No. 5 Xuehuali Road, the eastern end of the French Concession. His wife gave birth to a girl on June 11th of this year, which is the 19th day of the 5th month of the lunar calendar. They named her Xiaomeimei. She is innocent and lively, and is very loved by the Wu couple. However, Wu had to go to court every day to work, and all household affairs were handled by his wife. Since the birth of the child, because her own milk was insufficient, they hired a wet nurse to feed her. On the 10th of last month, they hired Chen Tangshi, a woman from Yangzhou (26 years old this year), from Xinji Nanny Agency at the intersection of Ximen Road and Malang Road to be a wet nurse. After a three-day trial, because her milk was suitable for the child, they immediately hired her and stated that the monthly salary was 8 yuan. On the 12th, they signed a guarantee and paid two months’ wages. Later, on the 16th, Tangshi suddenly wanted to ask for leave to go home. The Wu couple refused because the child had to be breastfed several times a day and could not be interrupted. Unexpectedly, Tangshi showed her irritable nature because the master did not allow her to take leave. She not only neglected to take care of the child but also often abused her, even beating the child at night. Another wet nurse saw this and told the master. The Wu couple initially did not believe her, thinking that the wet nurse was jealous. On the 5th of this month, the child suddenly felt a sore throat, which was cured after seeing a doctor. On the 8th, at noon, Tangshi used her fist to hit the child's head. Wu's wife happened to see it and thought that since she was abusing the child (who was only four months and two days old), it would be impossible to continue hiring her. She decided to dismiss her, ordered her to return the advanced one month's salary, and ordered the Nanny Agency and guarantor to come and take her away. Upon hearing this news, the woman held a grudge because she had to return the wages. On the same day, she secretly gave the child three threaded needles to swallow. Later, at about 4:00 PM in the afternoon, the child's sore throat had just improved, but she suddenly felt ill and cried non-stop. At this time, Jiang, a forensic doctor from the Second Special Court, happened to be at the Wu residence. He was asked to examine the child. At that time, the child's symptoms were very dangerous and she was about to die, but there was no way to explore the cause of the illness. Wu and his wife were ordered to send the child to Binlong Hospital. After examination by the doctor, the cause of the illness was also unknown, so they took her back and consulted a Chinese pediatrician. The day before yesterday at noon, the child had a bowel movement, and the child's mother took out a curved iron needle about four or five minutes long from the anus. Then, another wet nurse also took out a similar straight needle from the anus. At this point, the Wu couple were shocked and knew that Tangshi had harbored a grudge and murdered the child. They immediately reported it to the police station. Detective Peng Shidi from the Western District and the Chinese detective rushed to Wu's house to investigate. The Western detective also took out a pointed threaded needle from the child's anus. They immediately arrested Tangshi and brought her to the police station. According to her confession, because the master dismissed her and wanted to return the wages, she held a grudge and gave the child three needles to swallow while breastfeeding. The police chief ordered her to be detained. Yesterday afternoon, she was sent to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, presided over by Judge Zhang Chaozuo. According to the police lawyer Fei Xizhen, the defendant in this case committed the crime of premeditated attempted murder. The police station is now prosecuting her under Article 284, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Because the victim's child's condition is uncertain, he requested that the defendant be temporarily detained and the case be investigated at a later date. Then, the detective Bao reported the details of the case and presented the three needles that had been taken out as evidence. When questioned, the defendant Chen Tangshi completely overturned her confession in the police station, flatly denied giving the child the needles to swallow, and tried to deny it in every way. After the court verified the confession, it was announced that the hearing would be postponed to the 22nd, and the defendant was still in custody.</p>

<h3>After Metered Water Rates, There Are More Water Cutoff Disputes; Real Estate Association Asks to Form a Water Fee Committee; Taxpayers' Association Believes It Is a Tool to Resolve Disputes</h3>
<p>The water cutoff issue, which had been dormant due to metered water rates, has resurfaced in recent days. The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association and the Shanghai Real Estate Association both sent letters to Chief Inspector Johns of the Public Works Department yesterday, asking to stop water cutoffs and set up a water fee committee to quickly resolve this dispute. The two letters are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Letter</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent a letter to the Chief Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession yesterday, saying: "With reference to the letter from the Shanghai Real Estate Association, 'We have learned that the public concession's water problem has been resolved through the efforts of your association and the Chinese directors, and a trial method has been obtained. Our industry is deeply grateful, and many users have benefited. However, since the trial implementation, it has failed to effectively implement the ticket rules that metered billing does not increase the burden. There are many examples of this. Moreover, the landlords who collect and remit water fees on behalf of the company are still unable to bear the burden, and many of them pay a large portion of the rent for water. The Shanghai Water Company does not understand this and uses water cutoffs as a way to force payment. We believe that these disputes cannot be resolved without urgently establishing an organization. Various misunderstandings are difficult to eliminate, and effective cooperation is not easy to achieve. The Chief Inspector of the Public Works Department once made a verbal agreement to organize a water fee committee to manage the matter, but unfortunately, time has passed, and it has become a pie in the sky. We hereby write to your association and the Chinese directors to urge its formation so that the case can be reasonably resolved,' etc. Our association believes that the establishment of this kind of water fee committee is feasible and is difficult to use as a tool to resolve disputes. With reference to the previous reasons, we hereby write to ask you to investigate and summon it as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Real Estate Association Letter</h3>
<p>According to a letter from our member, Deli Company, regarding the water company's deadline for paying water fees, we immediately submitted the situation to your association. We were grateful that you agreed to negotiate with the Public Works Department. Unexpectedly, while the negotiations were in progress, the company disregarded everything and suddenly cut off all the water to Baifuli, Baluli, and Baoshouli between Pingliang Road, Huasheng Road, Yangzhou Road, and Fenzhou Road in the eastern district of our company this morning (the 8th) at 10:00 AM. The residents there were immediately panicked, and their drinking water was cut off, making them feel precarious. Since water is the source of life and an indispensable thing, the company's barbaric act is tantamount to threatening the lives of more than 2,000 residents there in order to blackmail our company. We hope that your association will quickly and seriously negotiate with the Public Works Department and restore the water pipes in that area as soon as possible so that the residents there can continue to receive water and avoid the danger to their lives. As for the water fee level, your association and the authorities will discuss it at length, and there will be public opinion on what is right and wrong. If the price is balanced, our company will definitely pay it. The matter concerns the lives of residents and the future of those who have property. It is very important, so please fight for it. We also received a letter from member Gu Lanji Accounting Office, saying that the water fees payable on Yalu Road and Yuanfang Road were higher than the quota, and they were unable to bear it. They had already explained it in detail, and on November 7, they received a reply from Zhan Tai, respectfully learning that they had written to the Public Works Department to stop it and convene a water fee committee to discuss it at length. Unexpectedly, the water company still did not understand and suddenly cut off the water to the above two places on the afternoon of the 9th, which is very surprising. We hereby write to inform you and respectfully request that you stop it quickly and discuss it at length to maintain public safety. According to the above information, after the trial implementation of the trial method, the original expectation was that the water fee committee agreed to verbally by your Chief Inspector would be established immediately to discuss the implementation methods of the principle of not increasing water fees for metered billing. I don’t know who is obstructing it or neglecting it. Our association has written to your Chief Inspector about the water fee committee and urged it to do so until now without interruption, but it has not been answered. I don’t know why. In case of any unfortunate events caused by the water cutoff, who will be to blame? According to the previous information, we hereby write to respectfully request your Chief Inspector to quickly adopt the necessary means to prevent the disaster."</p>
<h3>Women's Temperance Society Expands Anti-Beggary Movement in This City</h3>
<p>The Chinese Women's Temperance Association believes that the problem of beggars is related to humanity and public security, and that in Shanghai, where Chinese and foreigners live together, it especially tarnishes international admiration. Therefore, the association began to promote the anti-beggary movement 12 years ago and established the Women and Children's Education Center in Jiangwan for testing. Over the past ten years, the association has investigated beggars in this city and repeatedly suggested anti-beggary measures to the government authorities. More than 1,000 women and children beggars have been educated by the center. However, because the center is located in Jiangwan, the number of deaths and injuries among the center's staff during the Shanghai War, as well as the damage to the buildings, was enormous. Although the repairs have been completed, the orphans and elderly women in the center feel a great lack of food and clothing in this cold winter. In order to maintain the status quo and expand the anti-beggary movement in this port, the association launched a major fundraising campaign this month, aiming for 20,000 yuan. In addition to asking members to help, they also divided the campaign into two major teams.</p>
<h3>Two Bureau Chiefs Jointly Issue a Notice Prohibiting the Sale of Supernatural, Obscene Books and Paintings</h3>
<p>The two Bureau Chiefs of the Municipal Education and Public Security Bureaus issued a joint notice yesterday, saying: "According to the Municipal Government's Order No. 7328, 'According to the Ministry of Interior's Police Order, children's and popular books and paintings have a great impact on the country's social security, culture, customs, and ideology. Recently, it has been found that book vendors and stalls in various ports often fabricate stories with supernatural and obscene words, compiling them into pamphlets with pictures on the top and simple texts on the bottom, called children's books and paintings or popular publications. Generally, ignorant children and people with little literacy like to buy and read them, and the impact not only degrades the will of young people, but also harms the thinking of the country and the nation. Article 19, Paragraph 4 of the Publication Law strictly restricts publications from containing records that harm good customs. The Ministry has previously approved the case sent by the Beijing Municipal Government to investigate and deal with children's books and paintings, and the ban has been circulated. However, unscrupulous merchants take risks to profit, not hesitating to pretend to obey while actually violating the law. If the ban is not reiterated and strictly enforced, how can we distinguish right from wrong and correct customs? In addition to distributing the order, we should also order the public security organs to post notices so that the public is aware of it. At the same time, we should supervise and order subordinates to thoroughly search. If any of the above children's books and paintings and similar popular publications are found, they should be confiscated and burned to uphold the law and prevent their spread. We hereby order you to comply with and handle this order.'" According to this, the vulgar books and paintings of gods and obscenity hinder good customs, and the bureau has investigated and banned them. Now, in accordance with the aforementioned reasons, in addition to the Bureau of Education paying attention at any time, verifying and investigating, this Public Security Bureau orders that subordinates strictly investigate and ban them, and it is jointly announced to all bookstores, book stalls and vendors that from now on, they must not print, compile, or distribute children's popular books and paintings of gods and obscenity in order to promote good customs. If anyone dares to violate this, they will be severely punished according to the law once they are caught and will not be lenient.</p>
<h3>Various Jiangwan Organizations Request Speedy Dredging of Zouma Tang River</h3>
<p>The Jiangwan Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Jiangwan District Farmers Association of Shanghai jointly sent a letter to the Municipal and County Water Conservancy Committee, requesting the allocation of water conservancy funds accumulated in the district to dredge the Zouma Tang Municipal River. The Municipal and County Water Conservancy Committee has already made a resolution at a meeting to approve the allocation of 7,000 yuan for dredging Zouma Tang. It is understood that the Municipal Public Works Bureau has received a petition from various Jiangwan national organizations, requesting immediate measurement and construction to facilitate water conservancy. The text of the petition is as follows: "We respectfully request that the Zouma Tang in our district, which connects Shanghai in the south, Wusong in the north, and Changsu in the west, is the main artery of the market's water transport. It has been designated as a first-class tributary river by your bureau. It has been many years since it was dredged by local gentry in the 11th year of the Republic of China. It has been constantly eroded by the muddy tide and has become increasingly silted up. Last year's war turned the entire town into ruins, and rubble was dumped into the river. Although your bureau and various businesses in this town have successively sent workers to remove obstacles, the siltation is too severe, and water transport and irrigation are ineffective. Now that the government is working hard to revive commerce and agriculture, the committee members, who are serving in the local area, must first plan to dredge the main river channel of Zouma Tang to help it prosper. We have also learned that Dachang Township in Baoshan County is about to start construction to repair Zouma Tang. If our district does not dredge at the same time, it is like a person's torso has recovered its health, but the throat is still blocked, which is not a fundamental cure. Considering that the municipal treasury is very tight, although the total cost is only about 15,000 yuan, it is difficult to raise this amount suddenly. Therefore, the committee members have sent letters to the municipal and county district water conservancy committees to allocate all of the water conservancy funds of 7,000 yuan collected in this district to dredge Zouma Tang. This has been approved at a meeting, which shows the spirit of cooperation between the citizens and the municipal government, which is gratifying. Based on the above situation, we respectfully submit this petition to your Honor for review and approval, and to allow immediate measurement and construction to facilitate water conservancy and promote prosperity. We would be truly grateful. This document was drafted by our office and signed without a seal. A joint statement is made. Respectfully presented to Bureau Chief Shen, Municipal Affairs Committee members Wu Xuen and Gu Shanzhang, Jiangwan Branch of the Chamber of Commerce, Director Yibo, and Farmers Association Director Shen Yishi."</p>

<h3>County Government Begins Collecting Long-Term Brokerage Tax</h3>
<p>The long-term and short-term brokerage taxes payable by Shanghai brokerage firms are allocated to the education expenses of Jiangsu Province. Except for the short-term brokerage tax, which is handled by the Education Expenses Management Office and the China Merchants Bureau, the long-term brokerage tax is still collected and submitted by the county government. County Magistrate Pan believes that the period for collecting the long-term brokerage tax has arrived, so he ordered the department to check and fill in the tax forms for each long-term brokerage firm separately. Yesterday, he ordered the tax officer Yin Fengxiang to start collecting the tax immediately, and all collections must be completed by the end of the national calendar.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau and Mainland Water Company Sign Draft Water Purchase Contract; Municipal Government Has Approved and Sent to Municipal Council for Review; Term of Contract Tentatively Set at One Year</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has been approved by the Municipal Government to establish a Water Supply Office to prepare for supplying water to the Xujiahui area, the Hudong Wharf area, and ships berthed there. All water supply will be transferred from the Mainland Water Company. The Bureau has now negotiated a draft water purchase contract with the Water Company, consisting of 14 articles, which has been sent to the Municipal Council for review by the Municipal Government to show prudence. The important points are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Security Deposit and Water Fee</h3>
<p>(1) Security Deposit: The Bureau's Water Supply Office uses water from the Mainland Water Company to supply users, which is a business operation. The security deposit should be paid in accordance with Article 36 of the Company's Water Sales Business Regulations for business users. After consultation, it was changed to the amount of the security deposit for ordinary users in accordance with Article 24 of the same regulations, and then it was calculated at 65% of the amount, which is much less. (2) The price of water is 7 cents, 1 li, and 5 hao of silver per cubic meter, which is 3 jiao and 2 fen and 5 li of silver per thousand gallons, which is lower than the price of water stipulated in the Company's Water Sales Business Regulations.</p>
<h3>Collection and Payment of Water Fees</h3>
<p>(3) Method for Paying Water Fees: It is stipulated that upon receiving the monthly water bill from the company, the Water Supply Department of this Bureau shall, within ten days, verify and correct any errors. The company may then collect the payment from the Bureau at any time. If there are any outstanding water fees at the end of the year, the company may deduct them from the remuneration payable to the Municipal Government each year. The preceding clause was not originally considered necessary because the guarantee deposit payable by the Water Supply Department of this Bureau was intended to secure and guarantee water fees. However, the currently agreed upon amount is very small, only sufficient to cover meter maintenance, and cannot guarantee water fees. Therefore, the preceding clause was added. However, since the Water Supply Department of this Bureau has a fixed income from water fees, there should be no concern about arrears to the company.</p>
<h3>Method for Supplying Water Volume</h3>
<p>(4) Water Volume: It is stipulated that in the event of unavoidable circumstances leading to a shortage of water volume, the company shall first prioritize supplying users within its exclusive concession area. If there is any surplus, it may then be sold to the Water Supply Department. The preceding regulation is because the Water Supply Department of this Bureau supplies water to areas outside the company's exclusive concession area and is of a supplementary nature. This is similar to the arrangements where the Shanghai Waterworks Company supplies water to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, and the French Water and Electricity Company supplies water to inland water companies.</p>
<h3>Standards for Water Pressure</h3>
<p>(5) Water Pressure: The standard for water pressure shall be the existing pressure on the company's main pipes at the time of meter installation. If the Water Supply Department expands its facilities in Xujiahui in the future, increasing the number of users and resulting in insufficient water volume and pressure, the company shall not be forced to expand its facilities free of charge. However, if the company itself increases the number of users along its main pipes, leading to a reduction in water pressure at the main meter, the company shall immediately take measures to increase it. (6) Contract Period: Since the method of purchasing water for resale is still in its initial stage, it is impossible to predict how it will function in practice. Therefore, the contract period is tentatively set at one year.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers' Strike in Dongjiadu, Pudong, Resolved; All Pullers Resumed Work the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>Over three hundred and forty rickshaw pullers in Dongjiadu, Pudong, declared a strike starting the day before yesterday to protest against the district office's collection of guarantee fees and increased monthly license fees. This caused considerable inconvenience to local transportation, and the laborers found it impossible to make a living. Representatives such as Zhang Hanqing, Qian Xilong, and Zhou Cairong were elected to appeal to various authorities for assistance. Subsequently, Wei Renfu, a local elder, stepped in to mediate and consulted with the head of the Seventh District to find a solution. As a result, both sides agreed to concessions regarding the collection of rickshaw donations and other supplementary car fees. The entire workforce was ordered to resume work first. The workers expressed satisfaction and resumed normal work at 2:00 PM on the day before yesterday (the 12th), it is said.</p>
<h3>Shanghai and Nanjing Gentry and Merchants Establish a Steel Mill</h3>
<p>Steel is a primary necessity for all social undertakings and is of paramount importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. Regrettably, domestic production is extremely limited, and we have long relied on foreign sources, with money leaking out every year incalculable amounts. This is truly lamentable. It has now been reported that Shanghai and Nanjing gentry and merchants, including Zhang Qiwen, Li Kefu, Xiang Haoru, Ma Shengrong, Zhu Lin, Cui Xinhe, Mei Fengchun, Peng Yuncheng, and others, in view of this situation, to recover economic rights, and to revitalize industry, have specially raised funds to rent the entire steelmaking furnaces, machinery, storage yards, wharves, etc., of the Hexing Steel Plant in Shanghai, to establish the Hexing Xingji Steel Plant. They will initially focus on steelmaking to meet the urgent needs of society. They are currently sorting out the machinery, large furnaces, and all related procedures, and will be able to start smelting in the near future. It is also reported that the raw material, iron sand, will be supplied by the Li Hua Iron Mine in Xuzhou, which produces the highest quality domestic iron sand. It is said that the iron ore is the best among all iron sands in the country, ranking first, comparable to the best iron sands in the world. With such excellent quality, the steel produced will be even better, and its future development is immeasurable. It will add a unique brilliance to the industrial sector.</p>
<h3>Bank Association Holds Fourth Lecture</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bank Association has previously held three lectures, and the audience turnout was very enthusiastic. It is now reported that the association will hold its fourth lecture on the afternoon of the 14th of this month at 7:00 PM at the YMCA on Sichuan Road. They have specially invited Mr. Dai Ailu, manager of the Osaka branch of the Bank of China, to lecture. Mr. Dai has recently returned from Japan and is sure to have insightful views on the economic situation in the Far East, which will satisfy the expectations of the audience. Anyone concerned about Far Eastern economic issues is welcome to attend and listen.</p>
<h3>Zikawei Factory Tests Fire Extinguisher at This Venue Yesterday | Performance at 3:00 PM... Spectators Numbered 400 to 500 |</h3>
<p>The Zikawei Machinery and Iron Factory, in accordance with the agreement with this venue, gave a performance at 3:00 PM yesterday in the open space of this venue. The demonstration of the fire extinguishing effectiveness of the foam fire extinguisher invented by the factory was publicized in advance by this venue and various newspapers. Therefore, important figures from the financial community, various factories, and the press all attended to observe. At the appointed time, the factory's workers erected a tall wooden frame with many wooden planks placed inside. They temporarily poured gasoline on it, and after it was lit, the flames soared into the sky and were impossible to approach. The factory still considered it insufficient and poured gasoline and machine oil onto the burning wooden frame as much as possible. Therefore, the intensity of the fire was beyond expectations. However, once a Zikawei three-gallon foam fire extinguisher was used to put out the fire, it was extinguished in less than a minute. The speed of its effectiveness was astonishing. In response to requests from various fire extinguishing photography circles, another performance was given. The intensity of the fire was even greater than before, but the results of the extinguishing were the same as before. The spectators all clapped and praised it as the most effective fire-fighting weapon among domestic goods, far superior to other imitations.</p>
<h3>Progress of the Chinese Leprosy Sanatorium</h3>
<p>The Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, recognizing the need for a leprosy hospital in Shanghai, jointly with the Ministry of Interior Health Department, Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, Tongji Medical College, Shanghai Medical College, Chinese Vocational Education Society and other organizations, formed the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Leprosy Sanatorium. The first meeting was held yesterday at 5:00 PM at the Banking Association. Li Ting'an of the Health Bureau (represented by You Jihua), Weng Zhilong of Tongji (represented by Liang Zhiyan), Lai Douyan of Shanghai Medical College, Yan Fuqing, Ou Weiguo, Li Yuanxin, Zhu Shaoping, Fei Wusheng, Wang Zhiren, Wu Zhijian, Gao Mingqiang, and other representatives attended, totaling more than ten people. Yan Fuqing was elected as chairman, and the meeting proceeded as planned. (1) Mr. Wu Zhijian read a letter from Director Liu of the Health Department, stating that he could not attend due to his participation in the anniversary ceremony of the Suzhou Bo Xi Hospital. (2) The chairman reported on the situation of contacting the construction site. (3) The construction cost plan was discussed. In addition to the 20,000 yuan offered by the Chinese Leprosy Association, the remaining deficit of about 60,000 yuan was planned to be raised from all walks of life. The representatives suggested that various groups and individuals be tasked with fundraising separately. (4) Regarding the award for donors, it was decided to formulate detailed award rules based on the amount of donation and discuss them at the next meeting. (5) Mr. Wu reported on the communication with Bishop Huiji Liang of the Catholic Church in Jiangsu, stating that Bishop Hui expressed deep sympathy for the proposal to establish a leprosy sanatorium in Shanghai and promised to cooperate as much as possible. He planned to send Mr. Lu Bohong as a representative to participate in the meeting. The representatives unanimously agreed to invite Mr. Lu to join the preparatory committee and attend the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Tuberculosis Sanatorium's Public Letter to National Physicians</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tuberculosis Sanatorium at No. 4 Da Xi Road in this city, for the purpose of collecting materials and publicly reporting on the collection of tuberculosis patients from various places, has sent a public letter to national physicians as follows: Dear Sirs, Tuberculosis is the most widespread and difficult-to-cure disease in our country. The people of our organization, in view of the fact that many scenic areas have tuberculosis sanatoriums, tend to focus on natural therapy, and only accept patients with mild cases, rejecting second and third-stage severe cases. As a result, many tuberculosis patients have the possibility of treatment but cannot have their lives saved, which is truly regrettable. Shanghai is a major commercial port in the country, densely populated, and with a large number of tuberculosis patients. Therefore, without considering my lack of ability, I have established a tuberculosis sanatorium at No. 4 Daxi Road, located in western Shanghai, which is very suitable for patients to recuperate. In addition, artificial pneumothorax, diaphragmatic nerve resection, thoracoplasty, and other equipment are used to compensate for the lack of natural resources. Recently, due to the expansion of hospital affairs, a four-story sanatorium building has been built on Hongqiao Road, and we plan to strive for perfection in everything. However, the people of our organization are ashamed of their shallow knowledge and are worried about overstepping their bounds. We have always admired your deep medical skills and rich experience, your heart for saving the world, and your hands for restoring life. We hope that you will not hesitate to provide guidance and guidance. If you introduce patients to the hospital for treatment, we will be very grateful for the opportunity to study together. The hospital is still under the management of your doctor, or you can entrust it to the hospital's doctor. A report on the hospitalization process will be sent every two weeks. If you agree and come to guide us, we will be very welcome. Sincerely, Shanghai Tuberculosis Sanatorium.</p>
<h3>French Concession Police Arrest Four Extortionists of Street Vendors</h3>
<p>There have been hooligans on the recent sections of Route Conty and Rue du Marché in the French Concession who have been extorting illegal levies from a group of small business owners operating stalls. Upon learning of this matter, the French Concession Police dispatched detectives for secret investigation. Eventually, detectives from the Foreigner Advisory Section of the Detective Division arrested four members of this gang, namely Lin Mai Xiang, Wang Di, Yin Fulin, and Zhang Maoqing. They were sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation on the day before yesterday (the 13th). Because the police investigation was not complete, the judgment was changed to a later date for further inquiry. To date, there have been fourteen cases of this gang extorting money reported to the French Concession Police.</p>
<h3>Haikingbo Circus' Pony Dies of Starvation for its Owner</h3>
<p>Mr. Claybaugh of the Haikingbo Circus passed away at Baolong Hospital last Tuesday from urinary problems, as reported previously in this newspaper. His beloved horse constantly longed for its owner to return, eventually leading to starvation. Although members of the troupe tried to force-feed it, it became increasingly emaciated. It was taken to a veterinary hospital for treatment, but with little effect. It did not eat or sleep for several days and finally died in the hospital yesterday morning, following its closest friend to the underworld. The Shetland pony, one of the twenty-four ponies in the circus, was not the smallest, but was undoubtedly the most intelligent. Mr. Claybaugh and the pony formed a close friendship during their travels to the East. Now, they will follow each other to the underworld. Will their beautiful friendship continue into eternity?</p>
<h3>Tenants of Mingde Lane on Avenue Joffre Oppose Rent Increase</h3>
<p>More than thirty tenants of Mingde Lane on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession met yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM at the 6th District branch of the Citizens' Union on Rue Cardinal Mercier to discuss the issue of rent increases by the landlord. Yang Jinji, Yang Zhaolin, and Wang Jianhou were elected as the presidium. After the formalities, the representative Tao Jianhua first reported on the process of the landlord's exorbitant rent increase and the firm refusal of all tenants to accept the increase. Each tenant then expressed their opinions. After discussion, the following resolutions were made regarding the procedures to be followed: (1) All tenants will jointly send a letter to the landlord requesting exemption from the rent increase. (2) Send a letter to the 6th District branch of the Citizens' Union requesting assistance and, when appropriate, requesting that they act as mediators. (3) Notify all tenants that they must not independently agree to the rent increase; those who violate this will be considered to be undermining public interests, and all losses suffered by the entire group as a result will be the responsibility of the violators to compensate. A public agreement will be signed to ensure compliance. (4) Send a letter to the landlord demanding a response within one week. If there is no response, a meeting will be convened again to elect representatives to negotiate. (5) All temporary expenses payable by each household in this lane must be paid within one week. If the payment is not received, someone will be sent to collect it with a receipt. (6) Before a complete solution is reached, all rents will be paid at the original amount. If the landlord refuses to accept it, the rent due will be deposited into the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank for safekeeping to prevent the landlord from having any excuse. (7) All tenants should uniformly join the Mingde Lane branch of the 6th District of the Citizens' Union to strengthen solidarity. After the resolutions were passed, all documents were drafted by Wang Jianhou. The meeting adjourned at 8:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Celebration of Thanksgiving Service at Church of Our Saviour</h3>
<p>The Church of Our Saviour of the Chinese Anglican Church in Hongkou held a thanksgiving service yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Dr. Zhu Baoyuan, the first pastor of the district, taking charge of church affairs. The weather was warm, the church was filled with fresh chrysanthemums, and the walls were hung with satin banners. The whole church was brightly lit with candles.

From the medical community, there were Dr. Diao Xinde, Dr. Gu Enkang, and Dr. Lu Jinwen, as well as more than a thousand Chinese and foreign male and female believers, making it a grand occasion. Mr. Wei Xiben, the district pastor, and Mr. Zhu Yitian, along with all the male and female members of the liturgical society and the clergy, led the congregation into the sanctuary. After the entire congregation sang hymns, Chen Yisheng read the Psalms, followed by Pin Mingxing holding the incense burner, and then Pastor Li Peiting recited the Book of Revelation. After Pastor Yu Ensi of the district read Matthew Chapter 5, Dr. Zhu Baoyuan presided over the entire Nicene Creed service. The liturgical society's male and female choirs, along with the entire Yiyue society, sang "Enti" together, their voices resounding like cracks of silk, reverberating through the clouds. After that, Pastor Xu Taiyang reported on the situation of the 30th anniversary. Then, the chairman of the church's board of directors, representing all the directors and members, respectfully presented the district pastor with a commemorative gift for his 30 years of service. Then, Bishop Dai Penghou, on behalf of the clergy, presented a pure silver shield. Dr. Tang Zhongmo, president of the Central Theological Seminary, took the stage and lectured on "Predictions Regarding the Church of Our Savior in Shanghai in the Last Thirty Years", delivering a layered lecture that was engaging and pleasing to the ear. District Pastor Zhu Baoyuan blessed the congregation and sang hymns. The meeting ended at three quarters past four o'clock.

<h3>Record of the Banquet for Cheng Yanqiu and Others</h3>
<p>The Tianchan Stage, in order to promote the Peking Opera and to entertain people from all walks of life in Shanghai, spared no expense in entrusting Gu Yuebo, Gong Zhaoxiong, and others to go north to specially invite all the Qingyi Cheng Yanqiu who had returned from Europe, as well as Tan School successor Xusheng Tan Fuying, and all the leading actors to perform together. All personnel have arrived in China and are scheduled to take the stage on Wednesday night, the 15th of this month.

Those in attendance included managers and editors of major newspapers, writers, and celebrities from the military, political, business, and academic circles of Shanghai, numbering no less than several hundred people.

It is expected that when the stage is set on the 15th, the front of the Tianchan Stage on Yunnan Road will be a bustling scene with cars and horses and a large crowd.</p>
<h3>Woman Dies in a Fire Pit; Zhu Wang's Face and Head are Charred</h3>
<p>The Chunji Barber Shop at No. 352 Datong Road in Zhabei suddenly caught fire the day before yesterday. It occurred at night, so it was unstoppable. Once the fire spread, the house was completely destroyed and affected the neighbors on the left and right. The fire was eventually extinguished with the arrival of the fire brigades from various sections. However, at the time of the fire, Zhu Wang, a woman from Yancheng, forty-five years old, lived on the third floor of the barber shop. Because she was in a loft like a pigeon cage, she did not have time to escape and died in the fire pit. It was not until yesterday morning that the body was dug out. Her face and head were charred, and her limbs were incomplete, a truly tragic sight. The police station of the Fourth District ordered the landlord, Lu Abao, to report the matter to the local court. Prosecutor Ouyang and others were appointed to inspect the scene and confirm the death. The family was instructed to collect the body and wait for the fire starter to be investigated.</p>
<h3>Twelve Straw Huts Burned Down in Two Fires in Western Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, In your newspaper's local news column on the 12th, you published two news items about the resolution of a rent dispute in our neighborhood. We have received a letter from Mr. Feng Bingnan, stating that he did not serve as a Chinese director of the Municipal Council, and requesting our association to ask your newspaper to correct this. Upon investigation, the Real Estate Association did recommend Mr. Feng to the Municipal Council as a Chinese director this year, but Mr. Feng declined to serve, which caused this misunderstanding. Now, we will transcribe Mr. Feng's letter as follows: "Dear Sir, I was surprised to see the notice of thanks to me published by your tenants, etc., on the cover of the Shen Bao this month, and the news about the resolution of the rent dispute in Taoyuanfang in the local news column of the newspaper. Upon investigation, I have only done my best to mediate, and fortunately, the landlord also understands the righteousness. After consultation with Lawyer Yuan Hanyun of our office, it was finally resolved. All of this is just a matter of speaking, so why bother spending so much money to publish a thank you notice? Moreover, I am not a Chinese director of the Municipal Council. Seeing this notice, I feel uneasy. I dare to write this letter and hope that you will stop publishing the notice and send this letter to the newspaper for correction. Sincerely, Feng Bingnan to all the tenants of Taoyuanfang on Beihenan Road, Qipu Road, and Beijiangxi Road." We hope that you will grant the correction. Sincerely, the Taoyuanfang Tenants Association, November 13, 1933.</p>

<h3>Students Dissatisfied with New Dean of Studies, Storm at Wuben Girls' Middle School. ▲Director of Education Bureau and Principal Detained for Four Hours. ▲More Than 500 Students Went to the Municipal Government to Petition. The Education Bureau Ordered Temporary Suspension of Classes.</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaoying, the principal of the Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School, resigned from her position as principal in September because she was also a full-time legislator. The Education Bureau approved her resignation and selected Ms. Yan Zhenyu to succeed her. Unexpectedly, after the new principal took office, because the former Dean of Studies, Cheng Gengzuo, resigned, Principal Yan hired Jiang Wenbao. Unexpectedly, this caused dissatisfaction among the students, leading to a major storm. Yesterday morning, Director Pan took the opportunity to attend the memorial week and went to the school to persuade the students, but was immediately surrounded by the entire student body for four hours. It was not until around 12:00 noon that he broke through the encirclement under the protection of the police. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Reasons for Change</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaoying, the principal of Wuben Girls' Middle School, has always held the position of legislator. However, according to the regulations of the Secondary School Law, the principal of a secondary school should be a full-time position. Principal Wang has repeatedly applied to the Education Bureau for resignation, but Director Pan has always retained her because Principal Wang has been in charge of the school for many years. He advised her to resign from her position as legislator to comply with the law. Before this year's summer vacation, Principal Wang expressed to the Education Bureau that she was willing to resign from her position as legislator and serve as the full-time principal of Wuben. Therefore, after the summer vacation, Ms. Wang continued to serve. However, in September and October, Principal Wang suddenly expressed her intention to resign to Director Pan, and retention was ineffective. On October 25, she submitted her resignation, and the Education Bureau announced that Ms. Yan Zhenyu, a former professor at National Jinan University and a current professor at Daxia University, would succeed her as principal of Wuben. Everything continued as usual. Except for one or two teachers who voluntarily resigned, all other faculty members continued to teach, and no changes were made.</p>
<h3>Sudden Uprising</h3>
<p>The newly hired Dean of Studies, Jiang Wenbao, once served as a Party Ideology teacher at the school, and taught courses and served as the Director of Student Affairs at both the China Vocational School and Jingye Middle School. He has considerable educational experience. Unexpectedly, some students at the school were incited by a few troublemakers, and used the pretext of opposing Director Jiang to brew a student riot. Their actions were excessive and their remarks were abnormal. Although Principal Yan tried to persuade them, it was ineffective. She had no choice but to report to Director Pan that two students, Fang Xiuzhi and Li Minhua, who were at the forefront, were instructed to suspend their studies temporarily. Their parents were instructed to take them home to persuade them. If they repented, they would be allowed to return to school to show leniency. However, a small number of troublemakers used this to expand the riot. Yesterday (the 13th) morning, there was an excessive action of surrounding Principal Yan and Education Bureau Director Pan.</p>
<h3>Student Conditions</h3>
<p>At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, after Principal Yan arrived at the school, she was immediately surrounded by the entire student body in the office, demanding that she agree to the following conditions: 1. Immediately reinstate the two suspended students. 2. Replace the new Dean of Studies, Jiang Wenbao. 3. Allow the student self-government association to operate. Principal Yan was unable to cope and was surrounded.</p>
<h3>Surrounding the Director</h3>
<p>Later, Pan Gongzhan, the Director of the Education Bureau, learned that there was an undercurrent at Wuben and planned to go to the school during the memorial week to persuade the students not to be exploited by others and to avoid wasting their studies. The students then asked Director Pan to speak in the outside square. Director Pan then explained to the students that the replacement of the principal was due to Principal Wang's own resignation, and that he had repeatedly tried to retain her. Since the students did not object to the new principal, they should absolutely obey the new principal. However, the girls still insisted on their original proposal, demanding that Director Pan agree to the conditions proposed by the students before they would agree to attend classes. They wrote a note and ordered Director Pan to sign it. If he refused, they would use the method of surrounding the principal to detain the director. None of the school's faculty members came out to inquire. It was not until around 11:00 AM that a teacher named Yu Changyuan came out to persuade the students, but he was firmly rejected by the students, and nothing came of it.</p>
<h3>Locking the School Gate</h3>
<p>After the students surrounded the principal and the Director of the Education Bureau, they locked all the classrooms and the principal's office. The Education Bureau staff members knew that the director was surrounded inside, but they could not enter the school. Later, the Second District Public Security Bureau received the news and sent Director Li to lead the police to maintain order to avoid an accident. They broke into the school through the back door and did not protect Director Pan and Principal Yan until around 12:00 noon. The girls pulled and resisted, and the police officers were all strong men, so a few of the ladies suffered some losses and injuries, it was said.</p>
<h3>Truth of the Matter</h3>
<p>Director Pan went to the school at 8:00 AM yesterday morning with the intention of reporting the truth of Principal Wang's departure to the students during the memorial week and persuading them to study peacefully. At that time, some of the students were surrounding Principal Yan, using the revocation of the suspension of the two students as a pretext to make a forced petition. Director Pan personally gave a speech to the public, reporting the process of changing the principal and the reasons for the suspension of the two students. Finally, he stated his high expectations for Wuben Girls' School and urged the students not to take excessive actions. However, a small number of troublemaking students were unreasonable. The order was disrupted for a time, and Principal Yan's clothes were torn and Education Bureau staff members were beaten. She even took off her high-heeled leather shoes and threw them, which were picked up by passersby. Director Li of the Second District of the Public Security Bureau heard the news and led district officials and unarmed police officers to maintain order, but it was also ineffective. Director Pan saw that the students were unreasonable and felt deeply sorry. He was immediately accompanied by Education Bureau staff members to withdraw. The students rushed to chase after him, as if the tide was surging, and they squeezed each other, causing two people to be slightly injured. The students were sent to Qu Zhifu Hospital for examination. After the Education Bureau sent staff members to investigate the hospital, the hospital's doctor replied that the chest and buttocks were slightly injured by the squeeze and they were discharged from the hospital. It was rumored that two students were seriously injured and seven or eight were slightly injured, but that was not the case.</p>
<h3>Temporary Suspension of Classes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau announced that, upon investigation, some students of the Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School have been bewitched, incited a riot, acted excessively, and refused to be persuaded. The school shall temporarily suspend classes from today onwards, pending reorganization. Boarding students shall be temporarily taken back by their parents, and day students need not go to school during the class suspension period. In addition to ordering the school to comply, this announcement is made.</p>
<h3>Director's Remarks</h3>
<p>After the incident, Pan, Director of the Education Bureau, made a statement saying that the cause of this incident was that the students were young and inexperienced and were incited and exploited by others. The school has never had a student self-government association. Two days before Principal Wang resigned, a student self-government association suddenly appeared. The circumstances can be imagined. As for Principal Wang's resignation, it was actually due to her inability to handle both positions, not because the Education Bureau intended to replace her. Moreover, in July, he had first urged Principal Wang to consider the school's affairs and resign from the Legislative Yuan, but Principal Wang did not accept his suggestion, so Yan was hired to take the position. Moreover, Principal Yan has served as a professor at universities such as Jinan and other universities, and her qualifications are sufficient to be the principal of a middle school. Because he was afraid of accidents, he instructed Principal Yan not to change any of the school's old faculty members. Now, the school's Dean of Studies, Cheng, resigned voluntarily, which was not Principal Yan's intention. The students' actions were completely unreasonable. He went to the school this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) intending to use the opportunity of the memorial week to persuade the students not to be confused. After he arrived at the school, he immediately asked the school's faculty members to persuade the students first, but all of the school's faculty members were hiding in the room and no one was willing to take responsibility. After he personally went to ask them, they were unmoved. The faculty members are responsible for guiding the students. He expressed his deep regret for such irresponsibility, and the students did not understand the situation, which led to his being surrounded. As for the three points raised by the students, he had already stated to the students on the spot that as long as the parents of the two suspended students came to him to prove that the two students' wrong ideas had been awakened and guaranteed that there would be no more absurd actions in the future, they could be admitted to school and attend classes on the same day. The remaining two points could not be answered, and in fact, such requests were not allowed.</p>
<h3>Petition to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>At about 4:00 PM, the students of the school petitioned the Municipal Government. There were about 500 people, divided into seven or eight moving trucks. After arriving, Yu Yuebao, Jing Wen'e, Qian Dezhen, and Wu Shouzhong were elected as temporary representatives and immediately requested to meet with Mayor Wu. Since Mayor Wu was not there, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun represented him and asked the reason for the petition. According to the four representatives, the principal left the school, and they asked for protection. Later, the student representatives also requested that the newly appointed Dean of Studies, Jiang Wenbao, had a bad personality and failed to win the support of the public. Therefore, they requested to replace him with someone else. Yu comforted them. The two sides answered for about two hours. As a result, Yu replied that the Municipal Government did not yet know the detailed situation of this matter and needed to investigate and verify it. He also said to the four representatives that you students must concentrate on your studies. If the school's measures are inappropriate and sufficient to affect your studies, you can ask the principal if they belong to the faculty and staff. If the principal does not agree, you can present a report to the Education Bureau for handling in accordance with the law. Please do not neglect your studies and be good students. At this time, it was 5:30, and the sky was getting dark. They conveyed the message to all the petitioning students, who then took the bus and left the Municipal Government to return.</p>
<h3>Principal's Announcement</h3>
<p>Dear Parents, Mr. Wang Xiaoying, the former principal of our school, resigned from his position as principal because he concurrently served as a legislator in Nanjing and the provisions of the Secondary School Law that the principal cannot hold concurrent positions were not in compliance. The Municipal Government ordered Zhenyu to take over, but the transfer and acceptance procedures have not yet been completed, and one or two unscrupulous people have wantonly incited the students and brewed a riot in an attempt to obstruct the takeover and prevent Zhenyu from improving the school administration. A few students were bewitched by them, led by Fang Xiuzhi and Li Minhua, and used the pretext of opposing the new Dean of Studies to surround Zhenyu and interfere with the school administration. Zhenyu ordered Fang and Li to temporarily suspend their studies and hand them over to their parents to be taken back for management and education, and earnestly persuaded the other students to concentrate on their studies. The riot was quickly quelled. This was the incident on the 11th of this month. Unexpectedly, those unscrupulous people intentionally destroyed the school administration, provoked even more forcefully, and incited even more intensely. On the 13th of this month, Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau came to the school to report to the students on the change of principal during the memorial week. However, a group of bad students suddenly surrounded Director Pan and Zhenyu, shouting and disorderly in the corridor. They also sent people to close the school gate and guard the telephone, as if facing a great enemy, as if in the middle of a frenzy. Although Director Pan earnestly persuaded them, it was of no avail. When the police chief and police arrived at the school to maintain order, a group of students surrounded the police chief and threw their high-heeled leather shoes at his face. Zhenyu and others knew that they were under the coercion of unscrupulous people and could not be reasoned with, so they had to temporarily withdraw under the protection of the police. Zhenyu has been teaching at Jinan University, Guangxi University, and Daxia University for more than ten years, and has taught no less than tens of thousands of college and middle school students. She has never seen such a bad situation. Now that she has witnessed it and suffered it herself, she is extremely heartbroken. We are now ordered by the Municipal Education Bureau to open: (1) The middle school department of our school will temporarily suspend classes pending reorganization. (2) All day students and boarding students will be taken back by their parents. After the reorganization is completed, they will be notified to come to school. It is now scheduled to temporarily suspend classes starting tomorrow. Please ask all parents to quickly take their students back within three days to avoid being caught in the vortex again and causing harm. As soon as there is a date for the resumption of classes, you will be notified by special letter. There is no other way, please understand the reason. Sincerely, Yan Zhenyu, Principal of Shanghai Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School, November 13th.</p>

<h3>Old Song Prefecture's Seven County Education Associations Reorganize the Seven Counties' Educational Public Property ▲ A Discussion Was Held at the Shanghai County Education Association Yesterday ▲ It Was Decided to Convene a Reorganization Committee Composed of Representatives from Each County</h3>
<p>The seven counties of the former Song Prefecture, namely Shanghai, Nanhui, Qingpu, Chuansha, Songjiang, Fengxian, and Jinshan, all have educational public property. Since the abolition of the prefectural system, most of it has been kept by the Songjiang County Education Bureau. In recent years, there have been frequent reports of encroachment and theft. In order to reorganize the original public property and develop the educational undertakings of the seven counties, the Shanghai County Education Association specially convened a discussion meeting of representatives from the seven county education associations at the Shanghai County Education Association conference room at 11:30 AM yesterday. Those who attended included Sun Zhongji and Zhang Yi from Shanghai, Xia Yingwei and Sun Jingkun from Songjiang, Lu Rong'an (represented by Zhang Jingye) from Chuansha, Mao Zhiqian from Biao Pu, and Lu Qingshi from Fengxian. Sun Zhongji presided over the meeting and Xu Pengcheng took the minutes. After the ceremony, the chairman first reported the intention of convening the discussion meeting, followed by Sun Jingkun from Songjiang, Mao Zhiqian from Qingpu, and Zhang Yi from Shanghai, who expressed their opinions on the reorganization. After discussion, it was decided that the Shanghai County Education Association would submit a request to the county party headquarters to convene the seven county party headquarters, the county education bureau (or the relevant department of the county government), and the county education association to form a committee to reorganize the educational public property jointly owned by the seven counties. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the provincial education department to express the reorganization opinions, and opinions were also expressed to the county government education bureau. The required funds will be jointly borne by the seven county education associations. The representatives of each county also believed that the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association had not been organized for a long time, and decided to send a telegram to the education associations of each county to solicit initiators and inquire about the names of provincial representatives, and report to the Shanghai County Education Association before the 30th of this month, so as to convene a meeting of initiators and prepare for the establishment of the Provincial Education Association.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Schools to Plan and Trial the Two-Part System</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to municipal primary and secondary schools, stating that in order to implement short-term compulsory education, the bureau had designated 16 municipal schools in the previous semester to set up short-term non-study classes in advance. At a time when educational funding is insufficient, using existing classrooms to implement this short-term compulsory education is indeed a convenient method. The principals of each school should explain to the teachers sincerely, handle it carefully, and find ways to expand it further. In addition, the trial implementation of the two-part system in primary schools, which can enroll twice as many students in the same classroom at the same time, is a remedy for the lack of compulsory education facilities. The bureau has designated two schools to try it out first. All primary schools with a larger scale should make proper plans in preparation for the promotion and trial in the next semester, and report the planning situation for verification. All schools should abide by this order.</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Beiping-Tianjin Education Funding Protection Committee, Li Zheng, Arrive in Nanjing to Visit Education Minister Wang</h3>

<h3>Deadline for Professional Education Staff in Colleges and Above to Apply for Pensions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 13th) The Ministry of Education ordered all colleges and universities to submit applications for pensions for professional education staff within six months of the death of the staff member, following legal procedures. Otherwise, the applications will not be forwarded to prevent abuses. In addition, the names, qualifications, experience, salaries, and dates of arrival at the school of all professional education staff hired each semester should also be submitted in a list at any time for review.</p>
<h3>Conditions for Commending Donations to Education ▲ Schools Receiving Donations Must Issue Receipts</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 13th) The Ministry of Education ordered all departments and bureaus that in the future, all cases of donations to education submitted for commendation, whether the donation is movable or immovable property, must be accompanied by a receipt issued by the receiving school and submitted to the ministry. If it is land or houses, a detailed map and deed photograph must also be attached. As for books and equipment, a catalog or list should also be provided for verification and to avoid fraud.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province's Education Funding Decided to be Separated into Two Independent Phases</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou Correspondence) Zhejiang Province's education funding is more than 2.1 million yuan per year, but due to financial difficulties, it cannot be issued on time. Therefore, the Education Department, urged by the Ministry and after joint application by various educational administrative organs, intends to follow the methods of Hunan, Anhui, Henan, and other provinces to make education funding independent and designate foil tax, tooth tax, and tobacco and alcohol tax as special funds for allocation. Recently, at the meeting of principals of provincial secondary schools, the principals went to the provincial government to visit Chairman Lu Dipin to request that the education funding be guaranteed. It is now learned that this case has been discussed several times by Chen Bulei and Finance Director Zhou Junyan. According to Zhou's proposal, it has been generally decided to allocate 180,000 yuan of the annual income of 2.17 million yuan from the foil tax to the Ministry of Education and 500,000 yuan to Jiangsu Province. The remainder will be mortgaged for loans, so the education funding will be independent in two phases. If half of the independence is achieved this year, the loan will be repaid next year, and the tax revenue can be completely designated as special education funds, which will be mobilized by the Education Department to achieve complete independence, which will benefit education.

<h3>The Closing Ceremony of the Beiping City Boy Scout Inspection</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 13th) The Beiping City Boy Scout Inspection held an award ceremony on the 13th. The 541st Group won a large silk banner donated by President Wang, and the 282nd Group won a large silver shield donated by Chairman Jiang.</p>
<h3>The Closing Ceremony of the Zhejiang Province Principals' Meeting</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Province Secondary School Principals' Meeting (11th) was the fourth day. At 8:00 AM, Provincial Governor Lu Dipin summoned the principals, and more than 20 people arrived. Lu met them in person, inquired about the situation of each school in detail, and then the principals made statements on the issue of arrears in education funding. Lu's response was satisfactory. After the principals left, they went to the Finance Department to visit Director Zhou Junyan and expressed their opinions on designating special funds for education funding. Zhou also agreed to accept them. At 2:00 PM, the fourth general meeting continued to be held at the Education Department, chaired by Chen Bulei. He reported the total amount of aircraft donations from the education sector in the province. As of today, a total of more than 50,300 yuan has been received. The price of purchasing the aircraft is still insufficient. The principals who attended the meeting jointly undertook to raise another 4,000 yuan, which will be solicited from the faculty, staff, and students of each school and submitted to the department before the end of this month in order to raise the price as soon as possible so that the naming ceremony can be held as early as possible. Later, many proposals were passed. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM and held a closing ceremony.</p>
<h3>Ministry's Approval of the Request to Organize a Middle School Chinese Language Review Committee</h3>
<p>Yang Chengzhang, director of the private Sida Middle School in Beiping, requested the Ministry of Education to organize a middle school Chinese language textbook review committee to extract texts that violated the spirit of the times and strictly prohibit teaching them. After careful review, the Ministry of Education issued an order today, stating that the Chinese language curriculum standards for middle schools promulgated by the Ministry have provisions such as "cultivating national spirit" and "aiming to achieve national revitalization" in terms of objectives, and also have standards for selecting teaching materials, such as "(a) those that conform to the Chinese party-state system and policies, (b) those that contain the meaning of arousing national spirit and improving the status quo of society, (c) those that contain the common knowledge and ideas that citizens should have and do not violate the trends of the times, (d) those that conform to the reality of life and the physical and mental development of students, and do not have frivolous, lewd, or negative and pessimistic colors." The points made by the person submitting the application have already been covered. When the Ministry reviews textbooks, it orders the deletion and correction of any teaching materials that violate the spirit of the times, do not meet the curriculum standards, and contain decadent, lewd, negative, and pessimistic colors. There is no need to set up a committee again. The contents listed in the original document are very relevant to current abuses and are worthy of praise and should be kept for reference.</p>
<h3>Zhou Fohai Talks About Focusing All Efforts on Developing Education in Jiangbei</h3>
<p>(Qingjiangpu Correspondence) Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Education Department, in order to thoroughly understand the education of the counties of Jiangbei, specially departed from the province on the first of this month to inspect the education of Gaoyou, Baoying, and Huai'an counties. He arrived in Pu on the morning of the 9th. Those who came with Zhou included Yi Junzuo, chief editor, Chen Xifen, director of the second section, Xiang Jutan, director of the third section, and Tian Yaolong, director of general affairs. After Zhou arrived in Pu, he first went to the headquarters of the First Route Army to visit Commander Chen Diaoyuan. Chen happened to be inspecting the army in Ganzhou, and Zhao, director of the General Staff Office of the headquarters, represented Commander Chen in hosting a banquet for Zhou. During the banquet, Zhao gave a detailed report on the situation of bandit suppression in Jiangbei. After the meal, Zhou took a car to the Huaiyin Agricultural School to inspect the school's livestock farm, manufacturing plant, and student coursework. In the afternoon, he summoned all teachers and students of the school to give a speech. At 4:30 PM, he took a rickshaw to the Provincial Huai Normal School. According to Zhou, as of December last year, he had visited Rugao and Nantong counties in Jiangbei. Later, he returned to the province due to important matters. He was unable to inspect the entire area due to the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee. Jiangbei's production is backward, and there are years of disasters and famines, which is very different from the situation in Jiangnan. In the future, he will be determined to have the greatest confidence and work hard to rectify and expand Jiangbei's education, and will never allow Jiangnan to develop abnormally. However, at this time of rural economic bankruptcy, the poverty of rural families is well known. He will never increase the education mu tax to increase the burden on farmers. He can only reorganize the existing education taxes and rectify local education, be down-to-earth, eliminate floating waste, not talk on paper, and use facts to win the trust of the elders and brothers in Jiangbei. Zhou plans to delay his stay in Pu for a while, and then transfer to the counties of Xuhai. Last night (9th), he suddenly received a telegram from Chairman Chen, saying that there was an important matter to be discussed and hoped that he would return quickly. Therefore, Zhou inspected the Provincial People's Education Center last night (9th) at 10:00 PM, and continued to inspect Huaishi, Guanghua, Chengzhi, Vocational Middle School, and county town primary schools this morning (10th). He is scheduled to return to the province on the 11th.</p>

<p>丨Tonight, the Jia Group Two Rivers vs. Patriotic丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's women's basketball game featured Group A and Group B. In Group A, Jinan played against Chongde. The situation was very different. Jinan had Liu Mali and Zhang Zhenhe in the front, and Chen Ruiping in the back. Their tall stature made the Chongde girls lose their color and unable to use their skills. In the first half, it was 20 to 6. As a result, it was 41 to 17. Jinan won. Chongde was short in stature, lively and exquisite. He Miaoying was quite outstanding. The reason for the failure was due to the difference in physique. In Group B, Qiangdong won Jiangjiang, 24 to 13. There are three games tonight, and Group A is Two Rivers vs. Patriotic, which is also a one-sided situation. The difference will be very large. The schedule for tonight is as follows:</p>

<h3>About the Stupidity of the Athletes in Japan ▲Athletics Against Waseda University</h3>
<p>The athletic athletes who were sent to Japan by the puppet country, led by Yu Xiwei, originally intended to participate in the Japan National Games (Meiji Jingu Athletic Meet), but due to various reasons, it was not realized. The team then competed in a triangular competition with the Waseda University track and field team and the Manchurian Railway track and field athletes participating in the Meiji Jingu Games at the Waseda University track and field field in Tokyo on the 6th of this month. As a result, only the White Russian Anbino of the puppet country won first place in the shot put and second place in the discus, and the Chinese Guo Qingrong won second place in the shot put and third place in the discus. Guo's shot put score was 12.42 meters, and the discus score was 38.78 meters, both of which have exceeded the records of the motherland. It is a pity that the descendants of the Yellow Emperor are willing to serve the false and be puppets, which is very distressing.

<h3>Timely Purchase</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>Saving is a virtue, as everyone knows. Therefore, when a little darling with a runny nose is able to hide the money for buying candy in a piggy bank with a "ding-dong, ding-dong" sound, the parents are so happy that they can't close their mouths. By extension, millionaires who eat coarse corn bread and wear blue cloth cotton gowns and black cloth jackets, and hide large chunks of gold and small chunks of silver underground, are all complimented by everyone as "frugal and commendable."</p>
<p>However, according to economists, this virtue is "a trend that must not be allowed to grow." Because the formation of the economy depends entirely on the circulation of money. The faster the money circulates, the more stable the economic organization, and the more prosperous the country and society. If every little darling puts the money for buying candy in a piggy bank with a "ding-dong, ding-dong" sound, needless to say, the candy vendors in the streets and alleys will be greatly affected, and even the candy stores that were founded in the Tongzhi years may have to complain about their poor business? From small examples to large, we can also see the extent to which millionaires, who are reluctant to eat and reluctant to wear, and expand the area of hoarding desperately, affect the economic organization of the country and society.</p>
<p>The United States these days is playing the trick of inflation. President Roosevelt's advice to people to "buy in time" is based on this great truth. In fact, Americans, without Mr. Roosevelt's advice, have long been "buying in time" for many years. The crux of their inability to circulate money is not that the people are "stingy with every penny," but because they are "empty-handed." When the United States was not invaded by the recession, many workers had their own cars, wouldn't that be considered "buying in time"? Therefore, the "timely purchase" of Americans does not depend on discounts such as "double nine" or "20% off," but should focus on how to make the people have "purchasing power." Because Americans have the national character of "eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die."</p>
<p>In China, I think it is very possible to advocate "timely purchase" so as to prevent the rich from becoming slaves to wealth and causing the market to be deserted. But for the general modern men and women, we should vigorously advocate saving, because they have long been "eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die" and are living beyond their means.</p>
<h3>Collection of Kisses</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>A kiss's variations, a kiss is such a mysterious thing. According to Hollywood star Clara Bow, there are eight types of kisses on the silver screen: (1) a forced kiss, (2) a slight kiss, (3) a light and emotional kiss, (4) a passionate kiss, (5) an intimate kiss, (6) an intimate and delicate kiss, (7) an intense kiss, (8) an enthusiastic kiss.</p>
<p>(Two) Dictionary of Kisses: A kiss is: A child's right, a lover's private property, a hypocrite's mask; kissing a young maiden is | faith, kissing a married woman is | hope, kissing an old woman is | charity.</p>
<p>(Three) Kisses and Artists: Artist | In my models, you are the first one I have kissed. Model | How many models have you hired? Artist | Four: one apple, two bananas, one melon. (Four) Kiss Records: In New York, a non-stop kissing contest was held. In the first two days, three couples each achieved a record of sixty-six and a half minutes of continuous kissing. Why did they all stop at this moment? Why couldn't they continue? Was it a lack of air, fatigue in the lip muscles, or simply boredom? This is indeed a question worth studying. If they had adopted new methods, perhaps the kissing record would have improved and increased?</p>
<p>(Five) Kiss Theft: In Japan, there was a trend of stealing kisses. Young men on bicycles would ride around, and when they saw a beautiful girl on the street, they would lean down, and taking advantage of the girl's unguardedness, give her a few kisses, and then flee as if flying away. The kissed girls truly had no way to stop them. But this technique of stealing kisses also requires training.</p>
<p>(Six) The Kiss Test: A man has been longing to kiss a girl for a long time, but when he gets the first opportunity, he often lacks the courage to do so. A girl, although very willing to kiss her lover, always pretends to resist when he kisses her for the first time.</p>
<p>When a woman kisses a man for the first time, her face must turn as red as if she had stolen something.</p>
<h3>Interesting Divorce Statistics</h3>
<p>— Zhao Kuangyin</p>
<p>The country with the most divorce cases in the world is the United States. Divorce cases account for more than six out of ten of all cases in court. Recently, Washington lawyer Joseph Johnson compiled the divorce cases in New York one by one and came to a very interesting conclusion. According to his statistics, the most divorced people are in the arts, especially movie stars, followed by people in the music, stage, and theater industries. The academic and business communities are next, and people in the political arena also experience many changes due to environmental factors. The working class, however, has very, very few divorces.</p>
<p>Most divorces are caused by conflicts over economic issues. In the past, disagreements over hobbies led to conflicts, resulting in divorce, accounting for more than 40 percent. In a certain place in New York, there was a divorce case where the reason for the divorce was very simple and interesting. The husband liked to grow a beard and keep cats, but his wife objected, so both parties filed for divorce. There were also cases where the wife could not cook good food for her husband, leading to the husband's unhappiness and divorce, accounting for more than 30 percent. Therefore, cooking skills are truly a necessary condition for women.</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Gazing Affectionately, Serving Tea to Comfort Her Husband; Hurriedly Leaving the Frontier, Forcing a Smile to Bid Farewell to Her Family</p>
<p>He hadn't finished explaining the reason when someone from the battalion headquarters came to deliver a message: the battalion commander invited the company commander to collect some items. Receiving items was always a good thing, so Zhao Ziqiang went immediately. When he arrived at the battalion commander's office, he saw several paper packages piled up on the table, wrapped in large newspapers. The words "Company No. #" were written on the packages in red ink. Battalion Commander Bin Fang pointed to a package and smiled at him: "The National Salvation Federation heard that we were setting off and sent, sent a lot of summer medicine for us. The regimental headquarters has already allocated it, one package for each company, take it back with you." Zhao Ziqiang again felt that it was an unimportant matter. Perhaps the battalion commander had taken it from the regimental commander with great importance, so he also wanted the company commander to receive it with great importance. What else could be said, he could only take the paper package back to the company headquarters. When he arrived at the company headquarters, he had to open this large package of medicine again and hand it over to the three platoon leaders to distribute to the brothers. This layer of trouble that could have been saved hadn't ended, when a follower came into the room and said: "The shopkeeper from the grocery store is here again. I said the company commander was out. He said he personally saw the company commander go upstairs. He doesn't want money, he just wants to say a few words to the company commander." Zhao Ziqiang thought for a moment and said: "I'll go down and see him." When he went downstairs, he saw that the shopkeeper, Liu, was standing against the corner of the wall, his head almost buried in his chest. Zhao Ziqiang called out to him first: "Shopkeeper Liu, I'm really sorry, the salaries haven't been issued yet, even if you take my life, I can't get any money." The shopkeeper Liu, with a crying voice, said: "It's okay if you don't give it. I just beg you, when you get to the defense area, please send me a little money if you have any." Zhao Ziqiang looked at him, truly unbearable, and asked: "Including the old debts, how much money do I owe you in total?" The shopkeeper Liu said: "About twenty-odd yuan? If it's you, I have nothing to say, just making a friend, but others still owe me." As he spoke, he raised a sleeve to rub his eyes. Zhao Ziqiang truly felt sorry and took out two silver dollars from his pocket and handed them to him. The shopkeeper Liu was very content and left, thanking him profusely. (239)</p>
<h3>Brute Force</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>When children demand copper coins and food from their parents, and if their wishes are not granted, they can cry and make a fuss. This brute force method is most likely to provoke the parents' anger.</p>
<p>A wife constantly says it's for social reasons, playing mahjong, watching movies, and not returning home all day and night. The husband, facing such a brute force wife, dares not speak up and can only sit at home sighing.</p>
<p>Our enemy, disregarding international trust, forcibly occupies our country's land, only knowing to use brute force to the end, using might to erase justice, so the world has no peace.</p>
<p>Bandits kill and set fires, rob homes and loot property, not knowing what kindness is. Small commoners, encountering such brute force friends, can only abandon their wealth to save their lives, understanding clearly, and making a quick escape.</p>
<p>It is said that the taxes and grain in Sichuan Province have been pre-collected until after the 47th year of the Republic. These officials who levy excessive taxes only know to use brute force, only knowing to implement the principle of officials getting rich while the people grow thin. The life and death of the small commoners cannot be taken care of at all.</p>
<p>Uneducated women, when feeling angry and bored, often threaten people with death. Death is the hand grenade with which shrewish women implement their brute force policy. After the explosion, it often turns from fake to real, creating an irreparable situation.</p>
<h3>Women's Apartment</h3>
<p>— Hu Juzhen</p>
<p>As career opportunities have gradually opened up, women's economic independence is somewhat easier than before, but the lodging problem for women in the workforce has also become difficult at the same time. I am one of them. Last year, after graduating from the business school of a certain university in this city, I was fortunate enough to immediately find a position with a good monthly salary of 75 yuan. Because my parents live in South China, my lodging problem immediately arose. At first, I lived in the home of a married female friend who had three children and lived in a two-story house. Although I paid her 25 yuan a month, I felt many inconveniences. What made me particularly embarrassed was that she often quarreled with her husband. To avoid suspicion, I moved to a small attic room after two months. But there, I not only felt the inconvenience of dining, but also the lonely life, which was misunderstood by others, making me even more embarrassed than before. Fortunately, later a friend told me to go to the Shanghai Women's Apartment run by the China Women's Temperance Association at the intersection of Rue Luban and Route Papon. Sure enough, the name matched the reality. This apartment is indeed the most elegant and convenient residence for women traveling to Shanghai. Not only is transportation convenient, but the cost of lodging and meals is also extremely low. Hot water is available all day, there are stoves in winter, electric fans in summer, and the servants are also very diligent. I have been here for more than a year and am satisfied with everything. Because I think there are many sisters who have the same needs as me, it is worth my while to introduce it. (No compensation)</p>
<p>Travels</p>
<h3>A Trip to Tianping Mountain</h3>
<p>— Yinqiu</p>
<p>Suzhou is originally a place famous for its scenic spots. Adding to that, my desire for travel this autumn is particularly good, so in half a month, I visited Lion Grove once, and Tiger Hill again, viewing the beauty of the springs and rocks, and exploring the depth of the forests and valleys; admiring Ni Yunlin's lofty spirit, and visiting the relics of Sengzhao; reflecting on the past and present, drinking wine and composing poems together, which is originally a joy in life. But with the Double Ninth Festival over and the autumn scenery just right, I wanted to climb Tianping Mountain for enjoyment! So on the day of rest, I got up at dawn, and accompanied my wife Biyun and son Baikang out of Xu Gate, taking a boat; those traveling with me were Zhou Ziyu, Tian Chen, Jun Rukan, and Ji Kan. Chen was Biyun's female disciple, and Zhou was a classmate from the past. At seven o'clock, we untied the moorings, and with the sound of oars, we went into the middle of the stream. The boatman, surnamed Yuan, prepared tea for the guests. The boat was arranged very neatly, with a bamboo table without dust. Reclining in it, it could be called extremely comfortable. Along the way, looking at the scenery of the fields, the autumn colors were pleasing, and the shepherd boys, woodcutters, fishermen, and farmers all presented a harmonious appearance.</p>
<p>As the water journey neared the halfway point, the green mountains could be seen faintly. Tian laughed and pointed to Baikang, saying: "This is Qionglong, this is Lingyan, that is Qizi Upper Temple, the mountains undulating, like a screen; but Tianping, is still hidden in the smoky clouds!" Continuing forward for about half an hour, the road gradually approached, and the mountains gradually became visible. When we were about to reach the foot of the mountain, we ate in the boat to fill our stomachs. The village women on the shore competed to solicit palanquins, and some young girls took this as a profession, but there were not many men, presumably they were working in the fields. After stopping the boat, we went ashore. Tian and Ji Kan climbed the mountain vigorously, and Baikang was overjoyed and jumped to follow. We took a bamboo palanquin. The women in the mountains were as agile as flying. Following the mountain path, we advanced windingly, passing through the Children's Gate, where Tian took a photo with a shadow box. The Sea Film Company often comes to this place to shoot films, so it is also commonly seen on the screen, because the Royal Road is sloping and the mountain is towering, it is truly unique and interesting. Passing this, we saw towering pine trees and rugged rocks, approaching Wenzheng's tomb, commonly known as "Fan's Tomb." There are thousands of pine trees and tens of thousands of rocks, standing high in the sky, shaped like court tablets, which is the so-called "ten thousand tablets facing the sky!"</p>
<p>The palanquin bearers rested here. We first sat in Gaoyi Garden for a while, and then took a side road to climb the mountain. The road became more dangerous, the stones became more strange, and the scenery became more beautiful. Passing "Guanyin Cliff," we arrived at "Skyline," where the cliffs stood steeply, with a path cut through the middle. The words "Cloud Steps" are carved next to the cliff. Climbing straight up, after dozens of steps, it suddenly opened up again, arriving at "Tou Tuo Cliff." Standing still and looking down, the entire mountain was in sight. Shouting with the wind, my worldly concerns were immediately relieved! Baikang and I stopped here, and asked Tian to take another photo to commemorate it. The rest of the people bravely worked hard until they reached "Wanghu Terrace" and "Zhaohu Mirror," which can be called heroic. At this time, there were more tourists, and students from a certain girls' school also made a long journey here, and the lonely mountain spirit suddenly became lively. Mountain children were selling canes, which could help with mountain climbing, and everyone had a cane, making for a thriving business. When Baikang saw it, he also bought a cane. As we were sightseeing, Tian and the others descended the mountain, and we visited "Yunquan Abode" together. Next to the temple was "Baiyun Pavilion," which had been in disrepair for a long time and was about to collapse. After entering, we saw a stone at the door, on which was carved "Xiuyun." Turning inside, there was a line of spring water in the stone wall, named "One Line Spring." Going further in was "Baiyun Spring," where the spring water flowed down from the stone crevice, held by a alms bowl, also named "Alms Bowl Spring," trickling endlessly, neither overflowing nor drying up, with an extremely sweet taste, known as the number one spring in Wu.</p>
<p>The old monk Wuzhen received us warmly, leading us to a small pavilion, where he brewed spring water and sat to drink tea. We saw many couplets on the walls, including Zhao Huanguang's "The pool is shallow and still holds the moon," "The mountain is high and does not obstruct the clouds;" Fan Yukun's "Ten thousand tablets all rise from the flat ground" "A peak always inserts white clouds;" all belonged to fine verses. There was also Yu Tianqian's "Entering the room and stopping to look at the living spring eye," "Facing the mountain and bowing to the tall pagoda;" old friends' relics, made me sigh! The old monk said: "A month ago, Shun De Lian Shenghai, brought his mother to visit, and left a gift of ten characters, 'Enough mountain and enough water,' suitable for washing and suitable for poetry," that is the latest inscription." At that time, my old friend Wang Zidiancun and his wife Yuan Shizhuang suddenly arrived, an unexpected encounter, and the joy was knowable. Together we leaned on the window and looked into the distance? We saw that the maple trees in the mountains were already half red, resembling a slight blush after drinking alcohol, full of poetic meaning. Diancun said: "In another ten days, the mountain maples will be completely red after frost, and the ten thousand feet of red clouds will be even more magnificent, won't they?" Later, Diancun left first, and we also went down the mountain. In the shade of the green trees, the red windows were faintly visible, which was "Baiyun Ancient Temple," next to it was "Zhengwen Ancestral Hall," a famous mountain of great Confucian scholars, complementing each other, admiring it for a long time, making people feel respect. Baikang and I took a palanquin and returned to the boat, while the others walked, showing no signs of fatigue. We set sail at three o'clock, and planned to fill our stomachs again. The return journey was smooth, and the boat traveled extremely fast, arriving at Xujiang in just over five hours. Such a pleasant trip, it is impossible not to record it, so I wrote this in a jumble, and separately composed a travel poem of twenty-eight rhymes, asking friends to draw a picture to record the heroic mood of the time.</p>

<h3>The Needs of Youth</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>In the first issue of the fourth volume of "Modern", there is an article by Mr. Kang Siqun, "Mr. Zhou Zuoren", which contains these words:</p>
<p>"What today's youth need are more and newer patterns, strong stimulation and deception, therefore they are quite critical of this kind of quiet and truly profound remarks and attitude."</p>
<p>Mr. Kang's attitude in writing biographical accounts of writers is very humble. He believes that this paper (?) has no value and attributes it to age and knowledge. But towards young people, he also seems "quite critical", which is probably "what his age and knowledge can do".</p>
<p>Whether the readers of Mr. Zhou Zuoren's essays are all middle-aged or older, and whether "quiet and truly profound" is only needed by middle-aged or older people, that will not be researched for now. But being young is indeed too difficult, especially "now".</p>
<p>Needing "more and newer patterns", needing "strong stimulation", these are almost the characteristics of every young person, not necessarily "now". However, if young people "now" have this need, they immediately become a crime, becoming the subject of criticism. What is the reason for this? I want to borrow the mouth of the lacquerer Gu Hongsheng to answer it, saying: "I don't know."</p>
<p>What's even stranger is that Mr. Kang also believes that young people need "deception"; in other words, young people need others to tell lies to deceive themselves. As far as I know, some young people are deceived. But to say that this is their own need is almost slanderous.</p>
<p>In the past, during the imperial examinations, the court encouraged its subjects with eight-legged essays, and fathers and elder brothers supervised their children with eight-legged essays. Ten years of hard work by the window turned young people into obedient subjects who "only said yes". Whose need was this, whose success was this?</p>
<p>Moreover, in recent times, many senior gentlemen are using new objects to replace red and blue official hats as tools to lure and deceive, capturing young people one by one, teaching them to shout; after they have been used, they are arbitrarily played with, ridiculed, and mocked.</p>
<p>There are also those who disregard the needs of the times, creating young people into the same kind of people as themselves, moving them with sweet words, enticing them with great benefits, so those who are Europeanized are Europeanized, and those who are nationalized are nationalized. After being hoisted to the clouds, they trample to death the young people under their feet one by one. Then they say triumphantly: "This is the youth's own need."</p>
<p>Young Mr. Kang Siqun also said: "That is the youth's own need."</p>
<p>Alas, where can there be youth who need "deception", so that I can thoroughly investigate the matter!</p>
<h3>Hanging a Child</h3>
<p>— Sheng Huanming</p>
<p>My mother wrote in a letter: "...Yesterday morning, someone hung a boy in front of my house, ragged and pitiful, but my family is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, how can we afford to raise him? Today, I have entrusted A Gou to send him to the orphanage. Thinking back to when you were ten years old, there was also a similar thing. Although we did not accept him either, the past was prosperous and the present is declining, how can I not be filled with emotion..." Then she told me how many cases of hanging children there have been in recent years; because almost no family can easily afford to raise children.</p>
<p>I remembered the incident of hanging a child ten years ago: the child was placed in a half-gray vegetable basket and hung on the waist gate of my house one night, with his small nose facing the sky and his face red, he was a boy who had been born not many days ago. He was sleeping quietly in a pile of cotton wool; he was covered with a homespun apron and ten red eggs were also placed there. When he was discovered in the morning, he was awakened by the sound of talking, and he opened his eyes drowsily, took two breaths as if he was about to sneeze, and then cried out "guawa guaya".</p>
<p>"Ah! What a loud cry! What a child!" My mother wanted to keep him.</p>
<p>But my grandfather hated it very much, he muttered with a dry tobacco pipe in his mouth: "Shameless...must be the illegitimate child of that "slut", ruining the feng shui..."</p>
<p>These words expressed his opposition (but he would never say it directly.) My mother had to secretly ask someone to take three dollars and the child to the orphanage in the city.</p>
<p>As the weather got colder, my mother was worried about the baby and secretly sent a white cotton jacket that I wore when I was a child to the orphanage, preparing to give the child more clothes to wear.</p>
<p>"His own parents had already taken him back," said the Shen pastor from the orphanage.</p>
<p>My mother felt guilty about this for many days.</p>
<p>Later, Sister-in-law Yu Gui, the "gossipy woman", said: "Auntie, I found out that this is the child of the Guisheng family in "Gaosaka", dreaming or not dreaming, people are not content, the family is doing okay, but they still hang the child at someone else's house, wanting the child to grow up and read books thanks to your blessing! A child of their own 'pleasure', wanting others to raise him; wanting others to give him education! Dreaming or not dreaming, tsk tsk! People are really not content..."</p>
<p>That child has now grown into a young man who is "willing to work". Whenever this incident is mentioned, my mother always feels emotional about a person's fate and regrets not keeping him back then: "Truly unfortunate, if we had kept him, I don't know what kind of person he would be now!" When saying this, her eyes sparkled with excitement.</p>
<p>However, this time she could not accommodate this ragged baby again.</p>
<p>My mother's emotion is reasonable.</p>
<h3>Preface to Random Notes from a Rural Residence</h3>
<p>— Chen Zuiyun</p>
<p>In the summer of 1930, I suffered a major illness. Although the building faced a park, the sound of cars in front of the door was noisy day and night, which made me very disgusted with the city. After my illness slightly improved, I felt that I had to move. Due to certain conveniences, I hurriedly left Shanghai and moved to Puyuan, Jiaxing for recuperation. At first, the plan was only to stay in Puyuan for a month or two, and then move to the countryside in Hangzhou after my body was better. But Puyuan gave me the impression that it was not bad: at that time, my sick body had not yet recovered, and I was unable to move, so I lay in a small building every day, opening the windows and doors to look at the branches and sky outside the window, as well as the birds flying across the sky. Waking up at dawn, the midday was long, and in that quiet courtyard, cicadas often made long sounds, swaying into the window, clear and audible. As for the sisters in the neighboring family, gathering downstairs, occasionally made laughter, although I could not see them, they were also very dear. As for outside the back wall, vendors passing through the alleyway, even if they shouted "fried dough sticks" and "flat bean cakes," their voices were from far to near, or from near to far. It also felt melodious and lovely, without hindering tranquility. There was no coal ash entering the window. There was also no sound of cars disturbing people, and all restlessness was eliminated, making me feel more clear and pure. And when sunset fell and the sky darkened, it was even more peaceful. The long, quiet night was even more suitable for sound sleep. After my illness was greatly improved, although I once went to Shanghai, I soon returned to Puyuan and unknowingly lived there for more than a year. During my stay here, in addition to work, I also occasionally wrote miscellaneous notes, which I titled "Random Notes from a Rural Residence," writing and stopping from time to time, resulting in more than thirty notes.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1932, we moved to Wuzhen, Wuxing again, loving the tranquility of rural life, and living there for almost two years. During that time, I also continued to write "Random Notes from a Rural Residence," and except for a lost part, I obtained more than fifty notes. But both Wuzhen and Puyuan are water towns, with flat plains and no mountains in the whole area. Living there for a long time gradually gave rise to a feeling of dullness; and the "people of fertile land" are accustomed to laziness. Since there are many floating coffins and funerary houses in the fields, it is inevitable to be disgusted by seeing them. In the rivers, they casually dumped filth, and the drinking water was particularly turbid. Moreover, I was born in a mountainous area, and I love mountainous areas more than water towns, so I had the idea of moving again, intending to move to the countryside of Hangzhou in 1934, carrying books and pen. That place has the remaining veins of Tianmu Mountain winding into the territory, and the clear Tiaoxi River also flows eastward along the foot of the mountain. I intend to make my home here and live a life of half farming and half reading.</p>
<p>I remember when I was about twenty years old, I wore oval gold-rimmed glasses and perfectly round tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses in order to follow the "fashion," causing subtle pain in the corners of my eyes and on the bridge of my nose. Although I originally had no eye disease, and in order to follow the "fashionable hair," I also wore pointed shoes and narrow-opening leather boots, almost equivalent to cutting off my feet to fit the shoes, causing unnecessary suffering to my feet. Although these are not unforgivable behaviors, they are, after all, foolish and ridiculous, and they are precisely the result of being deceived and played with by "fashion." These are naturally still small things. As for other popular customs, writing, and thinking, covered with the coat of "fashion," the scams that are explicitly or implicitly indicated to us are no few either. How many can truly live up to the truth! Now I am a person in my twenties, and although I dare not say that my will has gradually become firm, I have finally seen through a bit of these tricks, so I love to walk my own path and am no longer willing to hesitate for the sake of blindly following "fashion." However, I dare not slacken in the ambition of "learning from those that I think are essential." In this turbulent era, although I live in the countryside, it is only slightly far from the "court" and "market," and I have not separated from the world, or perhaps I can pay more attention deeply and quietly, which is also what I dare not disparage myself.</p>
<p>Since I love to walk my own path, now, the date of leaving the water town and going to the mountain town is also gradually approaching. During my stay in this water town for more than three years, although I have gained nothing, I am not willing to remain silent, so I have compiled these "Rural Rhythms" into a book as a memento. The mood of these random notes is quite inconsistent: probably when my mood is pleasant, there are more joyful sounds, thus singing about nature and praising the countryside; when encountering shortcomings, there are more words of criticism, thus criticizing society and satirizing the system. Subjective and objective are difficult to distinguish; called random notes, they are also documentary. I only present what I have seen, heard, felt, and worried about to the readers. If I were to say "establishing words," then I would not dare to do so.</p>
<h3>On Tang's Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Yu Shi Xia</p>
<p>Ancient history tells us that after Tang attacked Jie, there was a severe drought for seven years. The officials of Yin divined that they should pray with a human sacrifice. Tang said, "What I ask for rain is for the people. If a human sacrifice is necessary, I will offer myself." Thereupon, he fasted, cut his hair and nails, and offered himself as a sacrifice to the shrine of the Mulberry Forest. The practice of executing people for sacrifice in ancient society is rarely seen in recorded history, except for the case of Tang's sacrifice. Zhang Taiyan先生 said that "Tang's sacrifice" was a mistake for "righteous banner", which is probably not the case. In the early days of society, people believed in a mix of humans and gods. Humans ate humans, and ghosts and gods had the same tastes. Cannibalism and human sacrifice existed at the same time. As time went on, only traces of the ancient ways remained. The Manchu Qing government once smeared Xu Xilin with blood to sacrifice to En Ming, and the Hongxian Emperor also smeared Wang Liansheng with blood to sacrifice to Zheng Rucheng, which still contained the remnants of human sacrifice.</p>
<p>Since the discovery of oracle bone inscriptions in the Ruins of Yin, the true picture of Yin society has been clarified. We cannot but thank Wang Guowei, Guo Moruo, and other scholars for their research achievements. Recently, Mr. Xu Jixuan wrote a book called "Yinqi Tongshi" (A Comprehensive Interpretation of Yin Oracle Bones). His analysis of Yin society is quite reasonable. His saying that the Yin Dynasty was a period of cannibalism is also well-founded. The "Classic of Mountains and Seas" contains the phrase "Wang Hai eats people." Han Fei has a saying that "Zhou confined King Wen, and grilled the Marquis of Yi, pickled the Marquis of Gui, cut out Bigan's heart, and turned the Marquis of Mei into meat sauce." The "Book of Zhou" also says that Shang Zhou was tyrannical and made dried meat of the Marquis of Gui to entertain the feudal lords. Ancient history is difficult to detail, but this can also prove the cannibalistic customs of the Yin Dynasty.</p>
<p>Xu suspects that Yin was in the Stone Age and had not yet emerged from tribal society. He discovered that a large part of the oracle bone inscriptions were phrases listing place names. What is a "fang" (方)? The Yin people called tribes "fang," just as Zhou called them "guo" (國), as in the phrase "You are guilty in ten thousand fang." What is a "fang name"? In the Yin Dynasty, each tribe must have had a symbol that formed a character as its mark. This kind of mark was the "fang name," such as Guifang (鬼方) and Xufang (徐方). He later discovered that the ancestral names in sacrificial texts were all fang names. He then realized that Yin used people from various fang for sacrifices. Before the sacrifice, a divination was performed to make a decision. All oracle bone inscriptions with fang names listed in parallel were of this type. Before organizing a dynasty, Yin was also one of the tribes, and its symbol was Tang (唐). The ancient form of Tang was 啺, and Tang was a corruption of 啺. There are three types of oracle bone inscriptions for sacrifices and temple names: one is Qi (契), the legendary ancestor of Tang; one is Wang Hai (王亥), the ancestor who expanded the tribe of Tang; and one is Tai Yi (太乙), recorded in the "Records of the Grand Historian" as Wang Yi (王乙), the ancestor who organized the dynasty of Tang. Later generations did not know that there was Tang, so they called it Tang. Based on the example of Chengzhou, it was called Cheng Tang (成湯). (The inscription on the Bo bell of the Marquis of Qi says "Cheng Tang.") History books mistakenly took it for the name of Tai Yi. According to Xu's theory, Tang should be written as Tang, and the story of "Tang's sacrifice" should have happened. Because in Yin society, cannibalism and human sacrifice coexisted, as evidenced by oracle bone inscriptions. Cheng Tang alone was unwilling to use human sacrifice, so he offered himself as a sacrifice. And he was unwilling to die immediately, so he only cut his hair and nails to show his intention.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (28)</h3>
<p>— Written by Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>While Zhean poured two full glasses of wine for the two ladies, Captain Boceru clinked glasses with old man Roland.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lu refused to drink, and Captain Boceru, who was familiar with her deceased husband, exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Drink, drink, Mrs. Lu, as our local saying goes, bisrepetita placent, which means, 'A small glass of Vermouth can never do any harm.' Look at me, since I retired, I have been drinking a little wine before dinner every day to make myself feel like the ship is swaying from side to side! After dinner and coffee, I drink a little more to make myself feel like the ship is swaying back and forth. This way, I will feel like I am sailing on a rough sea at night. But I will never make myself feel like I am sailing on a stormy sea, never, never, because I am afraid of disaster."</p>
<p>The old navigator's words resonated with old man Roland's nautical obsession. He laughed heartily, his face red and his eyes a little blurred from the anise liquor. He had the big belly that small shop owners often have, just a belly, as if all the other parts of his body were hidden inside this belly. This was the kind of soft belly that people who sit all the time have. They have no legs, no chest, no arms, no neck. The place under their chairs is often crushed by them.</p>
<p>Boceru was the opposite of him. Although he was short and fat, he was as round as an egg and as hard as a bullet.</p>
<p>Mrs. Roland had not yet finished her first glass of wine, but she was already intoxicated with happiness, her face flushed, her eyes sparkling. She stared at her son, Zhean.</p>
<p>Zhean was also beaming. This was a success. He had an income of 20,000 francs a year. In his smile, his louder voice, the way he looked at people, and his more generous manners, we could feel the power of money.</p>
<p>Dinner was ready. When old man Roland extended his arm to Mrs. Lu to invite her to the dining room, his wife exclaimed, "No, no, Daddy, today let Zhean be the host."</p>
<p>The dinner table was set unusually luxuriously. Zhean sat in the host's seat, where his father usually sat. In front of his plate was a large bouquet of silk flowers, a bouquet of fancy silk flowers for table decoration, towering like a decorated circular roof. Next to it were four fruit dishes, one filled with large peaches, the second containing a large cake filled with mixed cream, covered with a layer of sugar bells, a biscuit church; the third was many thin slices of pineapple soaked in clear syrup, and the fourth was even more gorgeous, a dish of black grapes from warm countries.</p>
<p>"Ah!" Biel said as he sat down, "We are celebrating the arrival of the wealthy Zhean."</p>

<h3>End of October Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Japanese Factories' Cotton Yarn Inventory Statistics: Chinese Yarn Increased by 2,620 Bales, Foreign Yarn Decreased by 2,570 Bales</h3>
<p>According to a survey by a certain Japanese firm in Shanghai, the total cotton yarn inventory in Shanghai at the end of October was 126,615 bales, an increase of 50 bales (compared to the end of the previous month, September). Among them, Japanese yarn was 13,610 bales, a decrease of 2,570 bales compared to the end of the previous month, and Chinese and British yarn was 113,500 bales, an increase of 2,620 bales compared to the end of the previous month. The reason for the sharp decrease in Japanese yarn inventory is that at the beginning of October, Japanese sales were active, and there was demand in the Manchurian and Indian markets, as well as in Hankou. Furthermore, in early October, purchases from the Tianjin group surged, leading to a rise in buying sentiment in various regions. At the end of the month, the market became active again due to the conversion of three-ply yarn, with 5,000 bales traded at that time. All of these factors contributed to the sharp decrease in Japanese yarn inventory. As for the sharp increase in Chinese yarn, the main reason is the continued weak purchasing power. Moreover, after the Cotton Industry Control Committee implemented measures to stabilize yarn prices, although price standards in the market improved, sales remained sluggish. Based on this, it is predicted that the Chinese yarn inventory will see a further increase by the end of November.</p>
<h3>Last Week Indian Cotton Did Not Rise with American Cotton</h3>
<p>Last week's market prices did not rise with American cotton due to exchange rate factors. Although American cotton was expensive after the government report was released, it remained peaceful due to profit-taking by bulls and the lack of important inquiries. Currently, speculators are waiting for the decision of Japanese and Indian merchants to return. Spot sales are progressing, and there have been transactions with Japanese and Far Eastern transporters. There has also been progress in China and Europe. Although local manufacturers hope to sell in large quantities, spot inquiries remain disappointing. The weather is good, and harvesting is going smoothly.

<h3>Grains: Flour Market Tightens After Sales to the North</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, the market for each month was initially stable. Due to the lack of quotations for foreign wheat, people were calm at the beginning. However, although there were no large-scale transactions by the merchant groups, the inventory of each factory gradually became depleted after smooth sales in Yingkou and Tianjin. Therefore, market sentiment gradually stabilized. In addition, some speculators, feeling uneasy due to the tightening market and the fact that foreign wheat had not yet arrived, also gradually competed, leading to a step-by-step increase in prices for both near and distant terms. According to the current situation, the actual sales during the river closure period will be watched. If there is no replenishment, the market will naturally remain bullish. As for the spot market in Tianjin, there was not much change, around 2.30 to 2.32 yuan. Major factories did not move, while smaller factories released some stocks. As a result, the prices for this month to January were two cents higher than the previous week, February was one and a half cents higher, March was one and seven-tenths cents higher, and April was one and two and a half tenths cents higher.</p>
<h3>Local Wheat Season Nearing Its End | Foreign Flour Rises to Replace It |</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw a consistent bullish trend in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Although there were no quotations for foreign wheat, the domestic wheat season is now nearing its end. Although there is still inventory in various regions, shipments have decreased. In addition, the recent active flour sales have naturally boosted market sentiment. Therefore, buying interest was strong in each session, and prices gradually rose. However, the future import of foreign wheat cannot be avoided, so the upward momentum is not very strong. As a result, the price for this month rose by four cents, December rose by six cents, January/February rose by five cents, and March rose by four cents. The spot wheat market is also trending firm, with factory demand still good. Shandong wheat opened at 4.10 yuan, Qingjiang wheat at 4.00 yuan, Taiwan wheat at 4.08 yuan, Yangzhou wheat at 3.90 yuan, second grade at 3.85 yuan, Jiangyan wheat at 3.99 yuan, Pudong wheat at 3.60 yuan, second grade at 3.56 yuan. Yufeng shipped 1,400 bags, Xinshen shipped 2,500 bags, and Shenda shipped 300 bags.</p>
<h3>Thick Japonica Rice Rises Nearly a Foot</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) There were more than 30 sources, totaling 4,000 to 5,000 stones, mostly late rice from various merchant groups, with Changshu, Suzhou, Tongzhou, and other Japonica rice, as well as Nangang and other thick rice, accounting for a small portion. Therefore, although the market showed a weak trend on the previous day, it was fortunately unaffected by the arrival of goods yesterday, and the market conditions improved instead. Thus, the quotations for Changshu, Suzhou, and other Japonica rice, as well as Nangang and other thick rice, increased by several cents to about a dime. As for Qingjiao, Xishi, and other late rice, although the amount of goods arriving accounted for half, the purchases were also equal, so the situation was not restrained. The sellers still intended to increase prices, but the merchants were worried that the merchant market would be difficult to strengthen, and the purchasing was unable to loosen, so the two sides were in opposition. As a result, the stalemate continued, and the market had not opened until the afternoon, so the market conditions for late rice could not be determined. The Du Yangjian shop had a good demand, and the price increased nearly a foot. Yinyuan continued to show well, while Bianyuan had no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Goods arrived from 50 different sources, and the market sales were sluggish. New Japonica rice, Yangdu,埠客秈, early rice, Pudong rice, and Yinyuan rice were all repeatedly flat and weak. Baiyuan liquor merchants picked up some tricks and made slight improvements, and retail sales were still good with prices remained stable.</p>
<h3>Merchant Indica Rice and Native Indica Rice Both Show Activity ▲ Jiangxi Rice Arrives and Gradually Becomes Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday's merchant Indica rice market turned active, with wheeled goods arriving at the port. After new Jiangxi machine-milled late rice was released, not much arrived at the head. In the past two days, the sources have gradually become strong. There will also be a gradual trend of activity afterwards. There is too much in stock and arrival in the market, and the market originally looks flat and soft. However, yesterday, the Japanese district was full of hoarding merchants' appetites, and merchant groups from Fujian and Guangdong were active. Guangdong merchants had not been active for a long time. Yesterday, the transaction involved more than 2,000 bags of city brown rice. Hoarding merchants in this district shipped 1,357 bags of Beijing factory Indica rice and old machine-milled late rice. Quanzhou accounted for the majority of Fujian shipments, with 140 bags of new Jiangxi late rice, 950 bags of Hunan rice, 500 bags of Jiangbei rice, 310 bags of Beijing wheeled Indica rice, 220 bags of Wuxi Indica rice, and more than 1,000 bags of Shashi brown rice. The total daily transaction of various types of rice was about 6,500 bags, and the price was one or two dimes higher than last weekend.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods and Top-Grade Vegetables Rise Another Yuan</h3>
<p>Dried lily flowers have recently become tight in the market as the inventory of the firms are thin, and the market price is becoming tight daily. In addition, sales to Guangdong and Fujian, and other merchant groups are quite good, so the market situation has risen again. For example, Zhuang vegetables opened to 20 yuan, another yuan higher than the previous session. Guangdong merchants shipped more than 200 bags again yesterday, and other groups also had transactions, and the trend is tight.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaozhou Green Sugar Area Lacks Supply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw various merchant groups' markets remain weak and difficult to rally. The association divided the market, with common goods of #14 coarse granulated white sugar initially called at 20.50 yuan, then 4.50 cents, but no goods were shipped. #20 medium granulated white sugar was called at 20 yuan, #8/9 Dutch red common sugar at 15.90 yuan, Taikoo Sugar B mark at 20.90 yuan, and Zhonghua #1 fine white sugar was called at 19.25 yuan, down another 5 cents. There were no transactions. If the sales of domestically produced green sugar improve, the market situation may recover. Because a certain firm sent a telegram for bowl green sugar, inquiring about prices in the origin area, and was informed that there was no stock, and the Shanghai inventory was only more than 2,000 bags. Therefore, the domestic Chaozhou green sugar will not be too low and has future prospects. During the transition between new and old stock, there is a greater possibility of rebounding.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Slightly Rises, Raw Oil Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>The soybean oil market has been hovering for a long time, mainly because there has been no change in the wire prices, customer sales are intermittent, and the sources are not abundant. The market price fluctuates slightly. Yesterday, more than 600 pieces of various oils were traded, and the price slightly rose. Peanut oil remains firmly at its original price because the outbound path is still available, and the arrival stock is not abundant. Therefore, the market situation will temporarily experience few changes.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Black Sheet Iron Shortage</h3>
<p>2 foot by 6 foot 18 gauge black iron sheets have recently been purchased by various groups in the northern route, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and other places, so transactions are quite numerous. However, not much goods arrive, so the market goods are in very short supply. The standard price is about 11.75 yuan per 100 catties (estimated by the pound scale), which is much higher than before. However, the enamel factories in this area are also developing, so they all have the intention to absorb. However, with limited inventory to supply the large-scale outbound path, the price aspect has a good possibility.</p>
<p>Although there is talk of changing to the metric scale in the hardware market, the regulations have not yet been issued. The actual buying and selling of various industries still uses the weight calculation of the pound scale (i.e., balance scale).</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Qihong No Market, Pingshui No Goods. Local Green Tea European Sales Slightly Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, local Zhenmei, Zhenmei needles, Shrimp eyes, and other green teas from Tongfu, Tianxiang, Yongxing, Fuchang, and other firms, resumed business. A total of more than 470 boxes were traded throughout the city. Shrimp eyes were sold at 72 yuan, Zhenmei were sold from 48 yuan to 67 yuan, with little up or down compared to before. However, the market price of Zhenmei needles, embroidery brows, etc., fell by about one or two yuan. As for the Pingshui green tea from the Lu village, because the stocks were depleted, there was no tea to meet the market demand. Qimen black tea was also not asked about.</p>

<h3>A Critique of "National Arts"</h3>
<p>— Li Zhai</p>
<p>Generally speaking, our nation is "skilled without learning" in many aspects. "Teacher Xiao's" burning cloth to treat illness is a kind of "skill"; the 63rd generation Zhang Tianshi carrying a token and sword to the Great World to draw talismans for people to eliminate disasters is also a kind of "skill"; the chanting and praying of the Panchen Lama (also known as "National Master") is another kind of "skill"; extending this, many traditional Chinese doctors' "orally passed down family secrets" are nothing more than "skills." Except for the "skills" of traditional Chinese doctors, many of which are undeniable and effective "experiences," the "skills" of other industries, even if they occasionally have effects, are very rare. To put it bluntly, they are nothing more than a kind of "lifestyle" of "knowing that it is impossible and doing it anyway." In general, the source of "skills" is mostly due to oral transmission, secret transmission, family transmission, or "transmission from extraordinary people," while transmission through books is relatively rare. Furthermore, all books that transmit "skills" take idealism or fantasy as their core, without scientific refinement. Among them, medical skills, although they can occasionally produce "unexpected effects," ultimately cannot explain why. This is the fundamental characteristic of all "skilled without learning" situations.</p>
<p>In China, 1933 is not only the so-called "National Goods Year," but also, from a practical perspective, can be considered the "Year of Skills." The Panchen Lama, who uses skills to seek officialdom, already has a Dharma name and a villa. Zhang Tianshi's income from selling talismans is said to be considerable. What's more, there is the newly "opening examinations to select heroes" of "National Arts," which is a grand event and "uniquely prosperous"!</p>
<p>The spread of "National Arts" in China has a very long history. This thing naturally occupied a large proportion in national defense in the Middle Ages, when gunpowder and all modern weapons had not yet been invented, and the method of warfare was limited to "wielding knives, riding horses, and fighting a hundred rounds." However, since the "foreign adults'" "Gospel of God" and various battleships and machine guns broke through and entered, the importance of "National Arts" has undoubtedly been reduced below the standard. I do not deny that there are indeed some famous or nameless people who have received "guidance from famous teachers" and, after ten or eight years of diligent practice, can jump more agilely and higher than Fu Baolu, who "broke the national record" this time, can become a strongman who can withstand a "car passing over his body," and can use a wooden stick to resist the fighting of more than a dozen people. However, for this kind of "unique" "National Arts," two of the most important understandings must be added, namely: 1. This kind of rare "hero" has been limited to an absolute minority of the population from beginning to end; 2. This kind of unique skill, no matter what, cannot block the toxic gas or "dum-dum bullets" of imported goods. Therefore, standing at the current stage of the times to evaluate "National Arts," it is at most:</p>
<p>For a few people who take "National Arts" as a lifelong hobby or career, it can at most create a few "heroes" who are no match for guns, cannons, and bombs, but many people are not their opponents. Such a person can serve as a physical education instructor in a military school under a certain system, can perform "jaw-dropping" performances in various entertainment venues, and can resist a few "bludgeoning" robbers when traveling at night (if you encounter a "friend" holding a pistol and "skinning a pig," it will be a big problem); at the lower end, you can only serve as guards or chief of guards for wealthy officials. (To put it "immorally," it is "human residue"!)</p>
<p>For the general public or young people, practicing boxing and kicking (limited to not using brute force) can at most be regarded as a kind of exercise to relax the muscles and promote blood circulation after tea or dinner, or during morning or evening exercises. If it is effective, it can help people eat an extra bowl of rice; if it is ineffective, it will not cause headaches or fevers. Anyway, learning "Tai Chi" is more meaningful than playing "five hundred" [a gambling game].</p>
<p>However, if the evaluation of "National Arts" exceeds the above and is exaggerated with wishful thinking, saying that promoting "National Arts" is precisely to "resist imperialism" or advocating "National Arts to save the country," then it is just like "Comrade Ah Q's" "participating in the Xinhai Revolution" 丨 "white helmets and white armor," "holding a steel whip to beat you" 丨</p>
<p>The serial pictures of "Civet Cat Exchanging Prince" and "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants" have performed the mission of "mass literature" in China for many years. In recent years, legends of wandering knights and various martial arts novels have been "spreading like wildfire." "Burning the Red Lotus Temple" has become the "spiritual nourishment" of backward masses. The poison has spread, raising the political fantasies of some petty-bourgeois citizens to the extreme. Sometimes "resisting Japan" inevitably becomes "reactionary," so they can only, from their own cultural atmosphere, imagine that there will be a "flying knight" to "take the heads of imperialists from thousands of miles away" for China! As a result, several groups of young apprentices secretly ran away, for the purpose of "traveling famous mountains and rivers, seeking famous teachers and extraordinary people, and learning swordsmanship"!</p>
<p>Now, the aftermath of the "Legends of Wandering Knights" has not subsided, and the "martial arts examination hall" of "national examinations" has emerged. The biggest result is not the dozens of "heroes'" heads broken on the "arena," but the opportunity to steal and publish, displaying in glass cabinets of many bookstores, not social sciences, but philosophy, not textbooks, but "Zhang Sanfeng's Secrets of Pill Refining," "Essentials for Hitting Hidden Weapons," "True Transmission of Iron Shirt..." This is definitely not a simple issue of profiteering by booksellers, but a reflection of the political consciousness of a backward nation!</p>
<p>If this "cultural movement" that promotes "martial arts" continues to develop for a long time, I don't know what will become of our nation!</p>
<h3>Women</h3>

<p>Mother-in-law: "That woman next door is really well-behaved. I don't think she's ever even been to the cinema."</p>
<p>Daughter-in-law: "But I've seen her go to the hotel every night."</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>Man: "You want me to go with you everywhere all day long. I don't have enough energy or time. Can you not ask me to follow you when you go out in the future?"</p>
<p>Woman: "If I often go out alone, you'll say I'm having affairs outside."</p>

<h3>"Chess and Mahjong"</h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>I often ask my friends this way: "Can you play chess?"</p>
<p>"No," most people answer.</p>
<p>"Can you play mahjong?"</p>
<p>"Yes," nine out of ten say.</p>
<p>"Aren't chess and mahjong the same kind of pastime? Why can you play mahjong for money but not play noble chess?"</p>
<p>Friends cannot answer.</p>
<p>This gives us a lesson, which is that people easily learn ignoble things but do not easily learn noble things. In other words, human nature is close to vulgarity.</p>
<p>Here I want to talk about something else. One of my teachers when I was young said this: "When I was young, the teacher asked me to read the Twenty-Four Histories. I would fall asleep after reading only a few paragraphs. But I liked to hide in bed and read *Dream of the Red Chamber* and *Romance of the West Chamber*. I could even read until dawn."</p>
<p>That teacher's conclusion about this fact was: "This is nature. It is rare to see children who can play chess, but it is common to see children who gamble."</p>
<p>We must open up the temptation of the environment.</p>

<h3>Abandoning Literature to Practice Martial Arts</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>To explain the topic, "abandoning literature to practice martial arts" does not mean "laying down the pen to join the army."</p>
<p>A friend of mine, after graduating from university with me, gave up a salary of fifty yuan a month in a good opportunity. Later, instead, he sold his brains and labor at the same time in a capitalist's office at the price of one dollar a day. At first, he was always dissatisfied in his heart. However, he knew that if he waited any longer for this bit of leftover food, there would be even less left. So, as the 24 hours a day and 30 days a month passed, he was leisurely content, very much enjoying the place and forgetting home. Naturally, for him and his mother, life in Shanghai was not necessarily better than the average person.</p>
<p>Recently, in the autumn "great sacrifice," this golden rice bowl that he had been holding for three years was snatched away by a new comprador's uncle or the like. In other words, he was "bird-lang-dang" in the mouth of his northern fellow villagers [unemployed]. He had no permanent property at home. The previous income of thirty yuan a month was just seeing bank advertisements saying that accumulating sand can form a mountain. I'm afraid he didn't have any sand to pile up this mountain. After being unemployed, this 130-pound body was not as good as a pig's head hanging at the door of a butcher shop.</p>
<p>Our friendship is relatively deep, and the address is also very close. So, he came to my small building every day. Although I could not help him materially, or help him in any way, two "bird-lang-dang" people with common interests met, even sighing a few times and complaining a few words seemed very satisfying. And the cost of our talking all day was only two packs of Xiao Hao Le cigarettes and a pot of cheap tea. If you must carefully calculate this bill, I will add ten more cash for the boiled water without deceiving heaven and earth. When we talked speculatively, we spread paper and licked the pen, writing manuscripts to various supplements, earning a few cents for cigarette expenses. However, his long talk about unemployment was finally thrown into the wastebasket by Mr. Editor. Originally, talking about unemployment in this year is too much like plain boiled water.</p>
<p>That day, we accidentally discovered a beef noodle stall. After several transactions, we learned that this small stall could do 20,000 business a day. Calculated at a profit of 30%, earning two yuan a day was a sure thing. So, in the past few days, we have been talking about this problem of abandoning literature to practice martial arts in my small building.</p>
<p>After spending a lot of money on books, coming out of school and high school, the leftover food of thirty yuan a month is still a matter of you grabbing and me snatching, even more so than having to carry it up from some pig's leg. Now, taking this beef noodle stall as an example, as long as you prepare 10 or 20 yuan of capital, know some common sense about beef, such as where to sell it cheaply and how to cook it, and add a profit of 30% or 40%, you can hang up a sign and write beef noodles for 200 cash per bowl, and beef soup for 120 cash per bowl. This kind of easy business can earn two yuan a day. We have read a lot of books after all. The intellectual class is not as good as a blue-clothed short-shirt friend who sets up a beef noodle stall. Therefore, the conclusion of our discussion is that it is better to abandon literature and practice martial arts.</p>
<p>"Abandoning literature" means taking off the long robe and short jacket | Western-style suits are also included in this example | "Practicing martial arts" means changing into blue cloth short shirts and pants.</p>
<p>Because we felt that there was no leftover food to grab, out of anger, we seemed determined to do it this way. However, until today, we two "bird-lang-dang" friends are still dragging a broken cotton robe and trying to find a job such as a clerk in the newspaper. Abandoning literature to practice martial arts, like a slogan, is ineffective among the self-proclaimed intellectual class who believe that "it is a small matter to starve to death, but a big matter to lose integrity." I am still calling for Xiao Hao Le and drinking cheap tea! (Not enjoying myself, I must declare especially)</p>
<p>Alas! Intellectual class! Alas! Long-gown comrades!</p>

<h3>Imitation</h3>
<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>Monkeys are the most imitative in the animal kingdom, but they have a big shortcoming, which is that they blindly imitate regardless of whether what they are imitating is bad or good. Guanghan Jun, in his article "Creation, Imitation, Enjoyment," said that the Chinese can only "enjoy." This statement is a bit too dogmatic. I think the Chinese "imitation" is a bit like a monkey. They "blindly imitate" what others say, without distinguishing whether other people's actions are harmful or beneficial. In short, as long as it is "new" and "modern," the Chinese will enthusiastically imitate it.</p>
<p>"Imitation" is not a harmful thing in itself. Take Japan as an example. Was it not a weak country like China is now fifty years ago? But it relied on the ability to "imitate." Today, fifty years later, it can actually annex our old China! But when "imitation" moved to China, our noble country is still the same old way! Even a few villagers actually say that one year is not as good as the year before! What is the reason for this? Here, we should recognize the Chinese "blind imitation." Don't you see? No one is willing to "catch up" and imitate Western science, but in Shanghai, even Jiangbei women know that men and women should hold hands when walking together!</p>
<p>Furthermore, in addition to "blind imitation," the Chinese also misunderstand the original meaning of what they are imitating. Even good things become bad when they are imitated by the Chinese. For example, "free love" in the West originally meant nothing more than giving men and women more opportunities to understand each other, so that there would be no gaps or problems after marriage in the future. But this "free love," once it took a boat and was imported into China from the far West, became an excuse for young people to play with women.</p>
<p>Things like this are endless, but let the past be the past! I hope that from today on丨don't wait for tomorrow again丨we should actively imitate the good culture of other countries! Because we must know that in active imitation, we can gradually cultivate "the power of creation"!</p>
<p>Compatriots, get up! Get up and "catch up" and imitate the science that our country lacks!</p>

<h3>Glory</h3>
<p>— 克洛</p>
<p>These days, Old Ma is working even harder! Look at him running around the track all day long, running, running, running, so vigorously! It seems as if he was born into this world solely for the purpose of running!</p>
<p>When friends see him, they always pat him on the shoulder, stick out a thumb and wave it in front of him, saying with a smile:</p>
<p>"Old Ma! Keep up the good work! If you win the championship in the entire conference, it will not only be your personal glory, but also the glory of our entire school... and even the glory of our entire province!..."</p>
<p>Education Today</p>
<p>Old Ma then became even more energetic. When he ran, it was as if he heard these words buzzing in his ears, and the two words "glory" immediately transformed into the sun overhead, how bright and brilliant it was, so much so that he was almost dizzy and unable to open his eyes!</p>
<p>"Can I really win the championship this time?..."</p>
<p>Sometimes he doubted himself, feeling that his running was still not good enough, and that he might fail this time, right? However, when he suddenly remembered the words "The ultimate victory surely belongs to the ultimate striver," this doubt immediately disappeared, because he had always been striving hard, of this he was confident. In that case, could the final victory still fly out of his grasp?</p>
<p>Thus, his entire heart was completely occupied by "glory"! Now he cared about nothing in the world. Needless to say, he no longer had the time to even read the newspaper. Even if he had some free time, he would just lie quietly on the bed, fantasizing about the scene when he would win the championship; the surging of thousands upon thousands of heads, the thunderous applause, the dazzling prizes, that…</p>
<p>"Hmm!..." He suddenly struck the bed heavily with his fist, his nose and eyes filled with smiles!</p>
<p>The day of the conference was fast approaching. Batches of athletes from different places set off for the meeting. The warm farewells and encouragement from friends and lovers at the train station made him even more excited. At the moment of parting, he felt a kind of tragic sentiment akin to "The wind howls, the Yi River runs cold, once a brave man departs, he will never return!"</p>
<p>Effort is never wasted. As a result of the conference, Old Ma did indeed win the championship. On the day of the award ceremony, he was simply as happy as if he were riding on a cloud, and his feet were a bit unsteady! He heard the words of praise and encouragement from all the dignitaries, each word hitting him right in the heart. So he tried his best to bite his lip, smiling inwardly, and at the same time thinking: "At this rate, I would be willing to be an athlete for the rest of my life!"</p>
<p>Ha! The prize was received, and he held those dazzling things in both hands, bowing sincerely to that most noble person in the country. "Performing this ritual is so simple, even kneeling down would be worth it…" This thought flashed through Old Ma's mind again.</p>
<p>Countless jealous and envious gazes were cast upon him. He was dazed. This was truly glory! In the process of this glorious anticipation and its realization, the global situation had undergone countless changes!</p>

<h3>Fragments of Childhood Memories (4)</h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>That was exactly the Double Ninth Festival.</p>
<p>Although the weather was still very warm, the unpleasant northwest wind had already howled all over the body. At that time, the scenery in the wild, from my perspective, seemed to have no meaning at all, I only felt that it was not as fun as spring, and everywhere revealed desolation and coldness, with flocks of geese dotting the high sky beyond the horizon.</p>
<p>(4) 列火</p>
<p>I had just been busy eating taro when Li Zongru from the ditch swaggered in, saying that he was inviting my older brother to climb the Monkey Mountain to enjoy the heights. He saw that I still had a taro in my mouth chewing, and then put on a serious face and said:</p>
<p>"Taro is something that causes indigestion, you can't eat too much!" Before he had said enough, he turned his face to my mother:</p>
<p>"Auntie, taro is not a good thing, children should not be allowed to eat too much of it!" He turned his face and said to me again:</p>
<p>"Brother, you've had enough taro, today is the Double Ninth Festival, come with us to climb the mountain, your brother is going too!" When it came to my brother, I got a little angry. At night, my father wanted me to recite some beginner's books in front of him, to prepare for making it easier to recite them fluently tomorrow, but he always seemed unwilling, as if he was very impatient. If he couldn't teach me how to pronounce it correctly once, he would throw the book and me aside and go into the bedroom, so I didn't want him to teach me anymore, preferring to be scolded in front of the teacher.</p>
<p>"I'm not going, I have something else to do!" I pondered for a while and said:</p>
<p>Coincidentally, my fifth sister from next door came with a large bowl of taro to eat and take away, so I took the opportunity to suggest to her:</p>
<p>"Fifth sister, the day before yesterday there was a big wind, the day before yesterday there was a big wind, and yesterday there was another big wind, the pine needles (Note 4) on the mountain must have been blown a foot thick, let's go rake pine needles! Anyway, we can't find anything good to do!</p>
<p>"Yes, A-Gui's mother was afraid that we would find out about the wind, so she quietly called A-Gui to rake them for a whole day, and piled them up in a corner of the woodshed, I saw it with my own eyes just now!"</p>
<p>"If we don't go now, he'll rake them all up by himself, at Zhangjia Mountain!" Fifth sister continued to add her opinion.</p>
<p>"Then, eat quickly! I'll go get the basket and the bow ready first!" I turned around and ran to the woodshed, and Fifth Sister also turned around and went back at the same time.</p>
<p>In fact, it was a bit strange. Since Yi Mei and Shan Mei successively occupied my mother's embrace, when I was just seven years old, I became extraordinarily close to Wang Si Ma's fifth little daughter. Although I had a good relationship with some other boys and girls of similar age, it was not as close as my relationship with Fifth Sister. Therefore, the two of us were often together, whether playing or doing some unimportant little things together, such as gathering firewood, buying oil and wine, small things like that, my mother often took care of us two, instructing us to do them, and we two were also quite happy to do them.</p>
<p>Because I didn't want to go mountain climbing with my older brother, I suggested to Fifth Sister to rake firewood, and Fifth Sister actually seconded it. My mother heard it and smiled and said it was good, so the matter was decided.</p>

<h3>Interview with Chinese Film Artists 22 (Continued from yesterday)</h3>
<p>— 沙基</p>
<p>(9) Li Pingqian, Director of "丰年" (Harvest) (Part 2)</p>
<p>"Also, recently I feel that in any aspect, the expression of strength is needed. Strength is the way to survive. So I want to make a film about strength. Strength is not simple. In any aspect, only strength can move everything. Only when a film is infused with strength can it exist forever.</p>
<p>"I won't say much more. My conversation has no organization, and I didn't prepare. There must be mistakes in it, but I can't talk." It was indeed not easy to say such a long passage in one breath. This is definitely not something that someone who can't talk can say. Isn't the little-mustached director being too modest? At this time, I put down my pen and rubbed my fingers, immediately thinking that being a private secretary is really not easy.</p>
<p>"Finished?" I said, "Then let me ask you again, what are your opinions on criticism, especially Shen Bao?"</p>
<p>"Needless to say, the transformation of Chinese films is certainly due to the new understanding of the majority of the staff, but critics have also made a great contribution. Critics have helped us to clearly identify the path. Regarding this point, I don't want to speak individually to a certain newspaper. In general, critics should be strict and fair, but they should also guide slowly, and should not be overly demanding. For example, critics are like a nanny, for a child who is underdeveloped and immature, they should provide guidance and instruction. When a child is just learning to walk, it is impossible to ask him to run."</p>
<p>"Then which film do you consider to be your representative work?" I asked.</p>
<p>"That's hard to say, you could also say that I am not satisfied with any of my own works. Some works are very bad, but that is mostly for the sake of making a living."</p>
<p>"Tell me your age and native place truthfully."</p>
<p>"My ancestral home is Tongcheng, Anhui, but I was born in Hangzhou. I am thirty-two years old this year. I studied at Shanghai University, but did not graduate due to financial reasons."</p>
<p>"Can you tell me about your daily life?"</p>
<p>"My working hours are very long. Due to physical reasons, I rest outside of work. I love literature and art very much. I used to be very interested in old poems and lyrics. Now, I always find comfort in my work. The results of my work are my comfort."</p>
<p>"In addition to directing films, do you also engage in writing?"</p>
<p>"I used to write some short essays, but I stopped after I started working in film."</p>
<p>After the questions and answers were over, I was preparing to wrap things up, but Cai Shusheng and "Monster" Shen Xiling walked over, and "Monster" even chimed in:</p>
<p>"Oh, old buddy, you don't know how to interview. Why don't you ask about his romance?"</p>
<p>"I have no romance," the little-mustached man said.</p>
<p>"Then what about you and ××? Isn't that so?"</p>
<p>"Well, everyone has those kinds of things."</p>
<p>"That's good, write it down." But Uncle Cai Shusheng said in Shanghai dialect:</p>
<p>"No, no, no, it's too 'disgusting.' But why do you keep a small mustache? That's something you can ask about."</p>
<p>"Well, it accidentally grew long, and now I'm too lazy to shave it off. Besides, I've reached the age where I can grow a beard."</p>
<p>"Then why are you called Li Pingqian?" It was "Monster's" strange tone again.</p>
<p>"I can answer that. I was originally called Qingping, because I lost my parents when I was young, and I was like duckweed. Later, I changed it to Pingqian, because of this name, you can see that I am a sentimental person. As for the surname Li, there is no way to explain it." (9) (The End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "铁血情澜" (Iron Blood Love)</h3>
<p>— 凌鹤</p>
<p>丨丨Central Cinema Showing丨丨</p>
<p>Regarding this film, I originally just wanted to point out a few points in principle. However, in order to make the criticism more closely related to the work, and to make the critical text more concrete, I will point out the good and bad aspects as much as possible. Let's start with the good aspects first.</p>
<p>First, it is essentially an anti-imperialist work. In 1932, our author boldly expressed his anti-imperialist enthusiasm. This is what we recognize Qian Xuefan did not completely erase reality, although he did not correctly understand the meaning of anti-imperialism.</p>
<p>Second, the photography is considered very good. Under the conditions of incomplete machinery, it is indeed painstaking to have such clear shots.</p>
<p>Third, the changing of shots is also reasonable. Due to the director's skill in taking scenery, such as when Yuan Congmei was rescued from the water, and the fishing scene, all captured the beauty of nature. Many other outdoor scenes are also very beautiful.</p>
<p>Fourth, the performances of Hu Ping and Yuan Congmei are passable, especially when fleeing, Hu Ping worked hard, but the scenes in the hospital seemed naive.</p>
<p>Fifth, the set designer also worked hard.</p>
<p>That's probably all, maybe there are some omissions, but I'm ashamed to say that I really can't remember them now. Now it's time to talk about the bad aspects.</p>
<p>First, what we should talk about first is this mythical story. It says that there is still a desert island in China, and there is still a queen on the island. This kind of absurd legend should be severely attacked at present. The author's intention to imagine this desert island is nothing more than to make the story have twists and turns, the so-called bizarre plot. However, this is always very ridiculous and very naive.</p>
<p>Second, having such an incomprehensible story has already made people unhappy, not to mention two fighting scenes. The two young masters have the courage of ten thousand men, which simply makes us wonder if the queen's "children" are made of tofu. Moreover, the two scenes are the same way, such as the two young masters taking advantage of others' unpreparedness and pouncing on the enemy from behind. From this, we can see that the director is not good at all-out martial arts either.</p>
<p>Third, when the second young master went to the desert island, we saw that he went by boat, but when he sent troops to save the country, he crossed a pontoon bridge and arrived in his own country, and fought a great battle with the enemy army.</p>
<p>Fourth, the war scenes, except for the insertion of newsreels, are not realistic. Fortunately, the editing is still acceptable.</p>
<p>Fifth, we only saw the queen had an old-fashioned pistol at first, but when she sent troops to kill the enemy, she had long spears and big knives, I don't know where they came from. As for the costumes of the strong men, they are even more bizarre, imitating the costumes of American Western films, but making all Chinese people into Americans.</p>
<p>But our countrymen do not despise this film without reason. In order to discuss the technology with the authors, I sincerely point out the specific aspects. As for the criticism of the creative method, this journal is very brief due to limited space, but the author's ideology cannot be changed by a single review, right?</p>
<h3>Review of "絶塞情鴻" (Love in the Fortress)</h3>
<p>— 亞夫</p>
<p>The Devil's in Love</p>
<p>丨Grand Light Showing丨</p>
<p>First of all, we must appreciate the director Wilhelm Dieterle's technique. Now I want to write out my opinions quite carefully according to the original procedure.</p>
<p>The beginning is that the French colonial garrison massacres the local indigenous people. A few short shots illustrate how much the rebels hate the existence of the garrison. Then he cleverly wrote about the friendship between the military doctor and the captain, which was temporarily represented by the military doctor teaching the captain to read his own letters, and everything was represented. Writing about the commander's tyranny is also very concise. In a single scene, he explained the plot thread of the orderly assassinating the commander in secret with the help of the military doctor. After that, he did not write about the commander's death, but only wrote about the orderly's fear at the time when the military doctor gave the poison to the commander, followed by a court-martial. Each person's close-up was really too good. The senior military officer leisurely waving his hand, in addition to showing the inherent demeanor of a typical character, also wrote about the weather at the time.</p>
<p>The military doctor's frankness, the orderly's extreme calmness, and the captain's warm friendship were all just right. When the orderly forged the confession, that kind of gentle and calm tone gave us the deepest impression. A supporting actor can have such achievements, which shows the foreign film actors' seriousness about technique. Afterwards, when the military doctor escaped from prison, that chilling atmosphere was also an outstanding achievement.</p>
<p>After that, such as the military doctor fleeing to another place, the children asking the sailors for money at the dock, very easily wrote about the poverty of the natives. In the middle of this, until the military doctor knew that his good friend the captain was Mari's fiancé, everything was a peaceful atmosphere. What is even more worth mentioning is that when Mari saw the native songs and dances in the flower shed on a moonlit night, the local color was of course written out, and after the lovers kissed once, the military doctor sent Mari back to her room, looking at the captain's portrait, although disappointed, he did not say it, only heard Mari's "Good Night", the military doctor dejectedly hid away. The next shot was the closing sound of the oil lamp, and from his eyes, it was written about the military doctor packing his luggage.</p>
<p>The relationship between the bar girl Lina and the military doctor, although it was only a few scenes, was already incisive. Until the military doctor and Mari fled to the original garrison location, it gradually became tense, until the final high temple.</p>
<p>When the military doctor and Mari rode horses near the castle, they were first discovered in panic by the sentry on the city, who thought that the rebels were coming again. Then they vaguely appeared in the darkness from a distance. When Mari and her fiancé hugged and kissed, the captain's dog rushed directly at the military doctor. Not discovering the friend himself first, but describing their friendship by means of the dog, is simply extremely clever.</p>
<p>After that, writing about the military doctor discovering the murderer, the orderly, sick with the plague, in the sound of the sentry's gun. Thus, on the one hand, he wrote about the military doctor cleverly obtaining the orderly's confession, and at the same time, the gunshots explained the rebels' attack on the city, without immediately expressing it with a picture, allowing the audience to focus their attention on memorizing the confession. As for this method of obtaining the orderly's confession, it is also very good. He shined a flashlight into the criminal's eyes, and then shone it on the commander's portrait. This application of psychology is very reasonable. If the criminal's conscience is changed, it is easy to disappoint people.</p>
<p>Once the confession was obtained, a gunshot from the murderer immediately started the rebels' attack on the city. The strict structure allows later film writers to get the best learning. The war scenes remind us of Ingram's "One Branch of Flowers". And the overall local color also has the flavor of Pabst's "Die Herrin von Atlantis" (The Mistress of Atlantis).</p>
<p>The entire performance deserves our most honorable praise. I hope that Chinese film artists will study it humbly.</p>
<p>In terms of content. We know that the playwright is trying his best to maintain the existence of the old forces, but he also sees the new future. Colonial resistance does not disappear because of cruel massacres, and after failure, it still has its victorious future. Although the author does not want the old to perish, he ultimately does not dare to obliterate the growth of the new!</p>
<h3>Review of "春雲紅霞" (Spring Clouds and Red Glows) "Born Lucky"</h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>丨丨Lyceum Theatre Showing丨丨</p>
<p>I remember that the formalists in art had a saying called "Art is technique", which is the fundamental theory of the old artists who paid attention to form. Therefore, in writing, they do not ask about the meaning of the story, or even whether the story becomes a story, but only pay attention to whether the description is careful and whether the structure is unique. This kind of proposition is carried out to the extreme, which is the strangeness of words and the chaos of content.</p>
<p>There are similar works in film. "Spring Clouds and Red Glows" is a very good example. It tells the story of a singer who, because of the teasing of the stage assistant, her protector clashes with the assistant and ends up in prison. The singer also falls in love with the screenwriter. At the same time, she is also employed by a rich family, and eventually becomes a singer again, becoming famous for a time.</p>
<p>At first glance, it can be seen that this story is completely meaningless and extremely incoherent. But why did the screenwriter adopt it?</p>
<p>First, as mentioned above, what they pay attention to is only "technique". If the story is long, they will not be able to fully use their "technique".</p>
<p>Second, "Spring Clouds and Red Glows" is an opera. What he pays attention to is originally in the singing aspect. Therefore, the screenwriter makes her both a singer, undergoes twists and turns, and then becomes a singer again, becoming famous for a time. In this way, her singing opportunities are increased. We know that the stories of song and dance films such as "The Merry Widow" are mostly discontinuous. This "Spring Clouds and Red Glows" inserts a story in the middle, which can at least add a little emotion to her singing. When we discuss song and dance films as song and dance films, we cannot but admit the screenwriter's cleverness.</p>
<p>But, how does the director use his technique? First of all, he uses contrast to explain the beauty of the singer's singing. He almost exaggeratedly describes the audience's reaction to show the beauty of the singer's singing. He, like other operas, also points the camera directly at the singer, and the camera follows her dance. He only combines the singing and the audience's entranced scenes. I think this application of sound art is very good.</p>
<p>Secondly, he replaces the singer's telling her protector about the assistant's teasing with a picture that is different from the ordinary picture; using the picture to replace the oral narration is common in films. But it is easy to make the audience interrupt their attention, so first, he uses a picture that is different from the ordinary picture, second, he sweeps it across the screen, which is faster than the ordinary picture, and is also silent. Both are worth learning from.</p>
<p>In addition, he uses very economical means to narrate the imprisonment of the singer's protector, etc. Because this is not the focus of the film.</p>
<p>However, there is a lot of use of thick lines in the picture. And this plot should not be expressed with thick-lined pictures at all, this is unharmonious.</p>
<p>The actor, the heroine has very many scenes, but when singing, you can't see her real expression, because the expression of singing always has standards. The acting in other places is not good.</p>
<h3>The Woman's Weakness Movie Novel My Weakness (2)</h3>
<p>— 復生</p>
<p>Longa said to his uncle: "This is all Quincy Holman's idea, telling you not to give me money to spend! Erleli, you're an old fool! She's trying to mine gold from you. You're confused by her. She's marrying you for your money! And her telling you not to give me money is her act of revenge!" His uncle said angrily: "Nonsense! Quincy is a naive and good woman." Longa said: "You're really an old fool, you get fascinated by just anyone." Erleli said: "No woman can trick me!" Longa said: "I'm going to see this woman who can't trick you. Inside a woman's belly is a bag of bad ideas. Smiles, movements, conversations, are all practiced to harm men!" Rolo nodded outside, expressing her full approval of Longa's views on women, but Longa also said: "I can take a woman, any woman, even a floor-scrubbing maid, get her some clothes, put on nice shoes, huh, uncle, I can make her marry a famous person in society!"</p>
<p>Rolo heard this outside, and was extremely happy. Longa is omnipotent. What he says he does. Since he said that any woman would do, of course she would also be able to. She forgot herself and actually opened the door and ran into Longa's room. She made a ridiculous face and said to Longa: "Sir, can you please try me first?" Longa was very angry when he saw her entering without being announced, but Rolo continued: "This seems too presumptuous. But since I heard your words, how can I not ask you for help? I hope to go up day by day: I hope to see the world and have some contact with society… Can you blame me?... I don't want to be a maid scrubbing floors all my life!" She paused and said again: "If you don't help, I can only marry Maxi. You haven't seen Maxi's appearance yet..." There were already tears in her eyes. Erleli heard this and jumped up and said to Longa: "Okay, Longa, you said you would do what this lady said. If she can marry a rich person, I will continue to give you money to spend!"</p>
<p>Rolo has known Maxi for a long time, but it was also a long time ago. At that time, she hadn't entered the hotel to work as a maid yet. Maxi is a truck driver, and it's fun to occasionally sit in Maxi's truck and take a spin. Sometimes they go out to eat together, but she has to buy her own fried noodles. Why is it like this? Just because a woman can't be without a boyfriend! But now it's different. Since she entered the hotel and worked as a maid, after seeing Longa, she watched him from afar during the day, and dreamed of him at night. Looking at Longa and then looking at Maxi, it's nauseating. Longa's hair is combed smoothly, and his face is shaved white. The blue shirt is as blue as his eyes. His smile is like anger and joy, very cute.</p>

<h3>Experience Required for Building Doors, Windows, and Stairs</h3>
<p>— Su</p>
<p>Doors, windows, and stairs, though auxiliary parts of a house, are extremely important to people's daily lives. Doors and windows provide natural light and air circulation, striving to be suitable for hygiene, so as not to fail the mission of building houses. Stairs facilitate daily life, and the function of doors and windows is similar. In the event of a fire, their function is even greater. Therefore, the experience required for doors, windows, and stairs is explained below, highlighting the essentials.</p>
<p>(1) Window Structure: The area occupied by windows also has precise regulations. For school buildings, the area occupied by windows must not be less than 20% to 25% of the floor area. The position of windows directly affects light, so attention should be paid to their arrangement. Generally, they are opened on the side walls. The following conditions should be considered regarding the source and nature of light:</p>
<p>(1) Light must be sufficient.</p>
<p>(2) The source of light must be continuous.</p>
<p>(3) Light must be diffused throughout the room.</p>
<p>(4) Windows, if arranged properly, can avoid direct sunlight and make it reflective light.</p>
<p>(D) Window Height: Light enters the room, limited by a vertical plane forming a 60-degree angle. If windows are only opened on one side of the wall, and sufficient light is desired throughout the room, the depth of the room must not exceed twice the height of the windows. If windows are opened on the side walls, their height must not be less than one-quarter of the depth of the room.</p>
<p>(B) Window Area: The size of the area through which light enters must be determined by the depth, height, position of the windows, and the quality of the glass. For school buildings, it should be 20% to 25% of the floor area. For factory buildings, the ordinary area of windows should be 50% to 60% of the floor area.</p>
<p>(C) Glass and Light Diffusion: Glass is the best material for transmitting light, so there are many types of glass used on windows. The following are some of the most important:</p>
<p>A. Commonly used glass is flat glass, with a thickness of one-eighth or one-sixteenth of an inch.</p>
<p>B. Frosted glass. The thickness of frosted glass is one-quarter inch or three-quarters inch.</p>
<p>C. Figured glass. The thickness of figured glass is the same as frosted glass.</p>
<p>A: Types and Styles of Windows: European and American windows can be roughly divided into three types: (1) fixed window frames, (2) movable window frames, and (3) pivot window frames. The structure of movable window frames can be further divided into two types: (1) single-sash movable windows and (2) double-sash movable window frames. The structure of this type of movable window frame involves installing pulleys in the window frame, suspending the pulleys with ropes, one end balancing the weight. Then, due to external force pulling, the pulleys rotate, and the window moves up and down along the grooves on the window frame. As for pivot window frames, the entire window's movement relies on the pivot on one side of the window to rotate. The structure of this type of pivot window frame is very suitable for doors, schools, and residential windows, which are mostly pivot window frames. Window frames in China are generally fixed window frames and pivot window frames. However, the window frames commonly used in China are different from those in Europe and America. The movable window frames in China do not use pulleys but rely on grooves and are mostly pulled open to the left and right by manpower.</p>
<p>(2) Door Structure: In the construction of European and American houses, the structure of doors is also made strong. Unimportant doors, such as those for wood sheds and toilets, use ledged doors. As for doors for residences, schools, and companies, the construction method generally adopts panelled doors.</p>
<p>This type of door structure is both common and strong. Opening and closing are done with active machine locks. As for the construction of factory doors, solidity is the greatest goal, so steel is used as the material for building doors. The doors of old-style Chinese houses are all made of wood. The structure is composed of horizontal and vertical wooden blocks. Where the wooden blocks intersect, bamboo strips or iron nails are used to join them. Those constructed with pivots can rotate back and forth. The method of opening and closing relies entirely on the central latch. Now, European and American styles have been adopted, but they are ultimately imitations. This point is raised in the hope that general architects will reconstruct doors unique to China.</p>
<p>(3) Stair Construction: Stairs are constructed by connecting steps, so a ladder is formed by steps. The structure of each step is divided into two parts, namely the riser and the tread. The height of the riser and the width of the tread have certain rules. The ordinary height of the riser is seven inches to seven and a half inches. The width of the tread is ten inches to ten and a half inches. European and American residences usually have at least two staircases, 丨丨 namely the front and back staircases 丨丨. The front staircase is for entry and exit, with a width of at least one foot. The angle of inclination is also fixed to make climbing easy and not waste time. The stairs of European and American houses are usually made of wood in residences. As for grand buildings, stone stairs and cement and steel reinforced concrete are used. The stairs of Chinese houses are different from those of Europe and America, but the materials used for construction are mostly wood. The style of construction is also not as refined as the construction style of European and American stairs.</p>
<p>Looking at the above sections, these are really experiences we should have. Because any building we construct lacks research and experience, that is, scientific knowledge, the constructed objects are ultimately not as refined as those in Europe and America. In the future, regardless of the size of the building, there must be a spirit of research and scientific knowledge. If so, it will surely surpass the refinement of Europe and America. 丨丨 Not only these attached parts.</p>
<h3>The Question of the Number of Floors in a House</h3>
<p>— Milu</p>
<p>In ancient times, the population was small and knowledge was limited. Everything was lacking and simple, so there were no houses. People only constructed nests of wood as places to hide and avoid beasts. Since the time of the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan, the population gradually increased and knowledge grew. People then greatly developed construction, building houses to seek comfortable living. In the Xia Dynasty, bricks and tiles were invented, so they were used to build houses. At the same time, stones were also used. Through the creations and improvements of successive dynasties, magnificent palaces and eternally strong city walls were built. Everything in this construction showed people's knowledge, which was constantly innovating. People's demands increased without reduction. Now, with trade between China and foreign countries and the gathering of merchants, the population is large, and the demand for houses is even greater. Science is flourishing and constantly emerging, so the development of construction is even faster. Cement and steel are used for construction, striving for solidity and beauty, entering the era of steel construction. In this process, we can see that the emergence and development of construction are shifted by people's knowledge and needs.</p>
<p>Taking houses as an example, they used to be very low, simple, and small. Later, there were high halls and large houses, but they were only one story. There were very few two- or three-story houses. That is not the case now. In major cities and developed industrial and commercial areas, the population increases day by day. One-story houses are really not enough. So, flat houses became multi-story houses, from one story to dozens of stories. In foreign countries, there are even hundreds of stories of houses. However, in cities with backward industry and commerce and small populations, they are still one-story flat houses. There are very few two- or three-story buildings. In this situation, we can also draw a conclusion: the increase in the number of floors in a house is determined by the size of the population and the development of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Although the number of floors in a house is increased due to a large population, developed industry and commerce, and various housing needs, I believe that even when the population is small and industry and commerce are not developed, the number of floors should also be increased. Why? For example, if you build a one-story house on a plot of land one mu in size, it is already enough for current needs. However, in the near future, if the population suddenly increases, industry and commerce develop, or there are other housing needs, and a two- or three-story house is required, but you only built a one-story house before, it is really not enough for use at this time. To build again, you need another mu of land, a long time, and a lot of money. To rebuild, it is a pity to abandon the previous house, and it also costs money and effort. In this way, you will regret the mistake of building a one-story house before. If you had built a three- or four-story house at that time, it would be perfect for use at this time, and it would save land, money, and effort. Therefore, when building a house, regardless of whether the population is large or small, whether industry and commerce are developed or not, the number of floors should be increased. Especially in Shanghai, the largest commercial port in East Asia, with more than three million residents, land is expensive, and more multi-story houses should be built to meet all housing needs.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of increasing the number of floors in houses, I have a small suggestion. I believe that the openness of houses should not be increased a lot across the board. There should be different degrees. In terms of city houses, that is, houses for opening shops, they should be built even higher than residences. Because in Shanghai, where industry and commerce are so developed, building two- or three-story houses is really not enough. Therefore, more floors should be built. If the economy is not sufficient, or due to various reasons, then at least four or five stories of city houses should be built. The houses in the current mainland business district are considered the best. Not only do they obtain the various benefits mentioned above, but they are also easy to rent out. As for residences, they should not be too high. Because there are no elevators in residences, it would be very inconvenient for people living inside to go up and down if they built houses with many floors. It is also very time-consuming and laborious. Especially for the elderly and children, it is even more undesirable. Therefore, three stories are most suitable for residences, and the maximum should not exceed four stories. It is also undesirable to be too low. I see that the residences in Shanghai that are rented out, that is, the houses in the alleys, are mostly two stories. There are very few three stories. This is really a pity. And you see that the second landlords who rent these two-story houses mostly build lofts themselves (commonly known as three-story buildings), and renting them out is also very easy. This can prove that in the current Shanghai, the population is increasing and the demand for houses is urgent. Two-story residences are really not enough. Therefore, I hope that the people who build alley houses in the future will find it most suitable and cost-effective to build three-story houses.</p>

<h3>Interior and Exterior Decoration of Modern Buildings</h3>
<p>— Shichun</p>
<p>Modern construction does not mean that the entire work is completed simply by creating a house where humans can live. Because humans are fundamentally animals with a strong aesthetic sense and a high desire for comfort, they strive for appropriateness and magnificence in everything. Clothing, food, and housing are the three major elements of human life, and there are necessary demands for the beauty and comfort of houses. Therefore, the interior and exterior decoration of modern buildings is even more valuable than the construction project itself. As times change, humans' aesthetic concepts and desires for comfort increase. In the era of the 20th century, the world has entered a period of civilization. Therefore, the aesthetic decoration in architecture has also reached its peak.</p>
<p>In the architecture of European and American countries, there are two types of architects called Inner and Outer Architects. Especially in countries such as the United States, Britain, Germany, and France, these two types of architects are strictly distinguished and not confused. The so-called inner architect is not a true house builder. Because modern architecture pays great attention to the interior and exterior decoration of houses, and the interior decoration cannot be fully understood by the architect who builds the house, this type of inner architect has emerged. His responsibility is to decorate the interior of the building into the most beautiful and comfortable rooms, while the outer architect is only responsible for the exterior aesthetics and functionality of the house. It is not within his responsibility. To put it simply, the outer architect is responsible for the construction and design of the house, as well as the exterior surface decoration, while the inner architect is responsible for the interior decoration of the room, the layout of the room, and the allocation of various applications. The interior decoration that the inner architect should have and the exterior decoration of the house that the outer architect is responsible for are described separately below, as a reference for studying the various parts of modern building decoration.</p>
<p>The working period of the inner architect must be after the entire building is completed. When the building is initially constructed, the interior is completely in the form of ordinary buildings. The inner architect should first make a preliminary allocation of all parts. Of course, this requires the consent of the homeowner. If the application of the rooms is completely allocated, then the method of arrangement is specified according to the application of the rooms. From the bedroom to the kitchen storage room, there is no room that is not carefully planned. Now, we will distinguish the arrangement of several types of interior buildings based on different applications. A general description of the systematic situation is divided as follows.</p>
<p>Bedroom: The layout of the bedroom is more important than all other rooms. Because the customs in European and American countries believe that people spend the most time sleeping in their lives. If the bedroom is not arranged into the most exquisite and ideal room, wouldn't it be a waste of a person's life? The bedroom layout of the inner architect is also the most important. Ordinary bedrooms in families are divided into two types: adult and child, and are all arranged upstairs. There are never bedrooms allocated downstairs. The interior colors of the bedroom are mostly dim and rarely bright. The walls are mostly painted blue, or even red. Some more particular ones use dark-colored wallpaper to cover the surface of the walls. Even more use fireproof paint to paint various dark colors. The direction of the windows is most suitable if it is not facing the front of the bed. It is most suitable for windows in the bedroom to be able to easily let in sunlight. The door must also be on the side. The most suitable door has only a small surface that can be opened and closed inside and outside, and the rest can be pushed into the wall. If there is relatively heavy furniture to be brought into the bedroom, it can avoid the obstruction of the door and it is more convenient to carry in and out, and two rooms can be combined into one large room. The arrangement of furniture is also the responsibility of the inner architect. In short, it must be suitable for the area and style of the room and be able to match the decoration of the house. This is the most important point of the inner architect's layout. As for the bedrooms of children, beautiful colors and red beds, chairs, tables, etc. are the most important points. The area and equipment in the room are of course smaller than the adult's bedroom. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>New Trends in Modern Architecture and High-Rise Buildings (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>In America, the height of buildings is also subject to considerable restrictions, but with the obstruction of sunlight as the standard. In other words, if it does not obstruct sunlight, the building can be raised as much as possible. London limits it to a height of eighty feet. This kind of law is not available in some provinces. Some provinces are completely based on local conditions and promulgated. In fact, because people generally think that there have never been multi-story buildings in the UK, there is no such law. In short, in terms of habits, the height of ordinary houses is always from seventy to eighty feet.</p>
<p>Manchester and Glasgow are currently discussing this high-rise issue. In the near future, I may have many multi-story buildings built, which are rare in the UK. Other provinces are also discussing the height of these houses and whether they should be limited. But in London, especially the health authorities, are paying close attention to this issue. Do not allow the houses to be too high to prevent hazards.</p>
<p>The increase in the height of houses and the issue of fire prevention are indeed very important. Because once the house is high, if a house is destroyed by fire, many families will suffer losses. Therefore, at this time of architectural tendency toward multi-story, fire prevention should also be paid extra attention. From the current trend, the methods of fire prevention are nothing more than the preparation of the authorities and the adequacy of fire-fighting equipment. On the other hand, the scientific construction of houses is used to prevent fire. But in London and other areas, water pressure is insufficient, and fire-fighting equipment cannot make water pressure reach houses above one hundred feet. The height of houses in London is limited to eighty feet. It is said that it was set by Queen Victoria. Because once she leaned on the window of Buckingham Palace and looked out at the high tower of Queen Anne's Palace, she insisted on this height and added it to the building law.</p>
<p>In the current world, the tendency of increasing the number of floors in houses is the same in all countries except the UK. Especially in prosperous metropolises. But if we examine the reasons for the increase, there are only two. On the one hand, because people's residences tend to be concentrated in cities in recent years, people from the countryside come to the city to find a way out. As a result, the record of the population in the city is increasing day by day. After the population increases, there is a panic that all houses are not enough to live in. As a result, rent and land prices have increased. The general landlords have to find ways to increase the number of floors in the house to accommodate the increased population. On the other hand, some landlords are now becoming more and more savvy. Because land prices and land taxes are irrelevant to houses. The same piece of land and the same tax, build a few more floors of houses, and the landlord can collect more rent for nothing. Isn't it very cheap? Why not do it from an economic point of view?</p>
<p>Let's leave overseas and talk about Shanghai. Recently, the architecture in Shanghai has also tended to increase the number of floors. If you don't believe it, look at the old two-story houses that were demolished. The new houses are all three stories or more. As for city houses, in busy areas such as Nanjing Road, Jiangxi Road, and Sichuan Road, the newly built city houses are more than five or six stories in nineteen. The only reason for the increase in the number of floors in Shanghai's houses is, of course, the increase in population and the landlord's maximal utilization of land. But Shanghai is just like London. The foundation is very loose and not as solid as New York. Therefore, the number of floors in the house cannot be increased as much as possible and without restriction. At the same time, whether the power of fire prevention is that the water pressure can reach above several floors is also a question worth studying. Moreover, from the perspective of Shanghai's environment, the construction of the city center can disperse part of the power of the concession because of the wide range of land. The conclusion we hear from these facts is that although Shanghai's architecture has recently tended to increase the number of floors, it will definitely not form a city of high-rise buildings in the short term. And the high-rise buildings mentioned here are not like those in New York. If it is realized, at most it will be houses of about ten stories.</p>
<h3>▲ New Contribution to the Architectural World</h3>
<p>Various domestic water-repellent products of Yali Manufacturing Factory, such as water-repellent paste, water-repellent paint, transparent water-repellent paint, etc., have been widely praised by the architectural and construction industries since their launch. The factory owner, Engineer Zheng Ruyi, has been studying water-repellent building materials for a long time. Recently, he invented a kind of "Special Quick Essence" (English name: Ouika), which can make cement solidify in a few seconds, which is an essential product for water-repellent projects such as dams and pits. There are currently dozens of projects repaired with "Special Quick Essence" such as Citibank. However, this material cannot be used without specially trained workers. Therefore, the factory's engineering department specializes in contracting water-repellent projects in pits.</p>
