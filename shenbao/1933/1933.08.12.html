<p>時評察局之善後·明　　擾攘數月。政府認爲隠憂人民引爲疑懼之察哈爾問題。近以宋哲元氏之入駐張垣。馮玉祥氏自行北退。形式上可謂告一段落。蓋此搖動不安之察哈爾。一面影響國際。一面震撼華北。此後雖不免有若干困難問題。尙待解决。然茍能鄭重應付。處理得宜。大體上總可謂爲漸趨平穩也。當馮玉祥氏舉兵之初。抗日之名。非不佳也。多倫之收復。非不勇也。惟惜察哈爾一省之微。其土地面積。雖超過八十二萬方里。而人口則不過二百萬。尤以近年承兵燹之餘。平綏路幾不能支持其自身之費用。以此區區。而云抗日。無論志趣如何高遠。計算如何精確。對此國際戰爭。决無可倖勝之理。况馮氏部下。矛盾過多。一則政令不能統一。再則除徵發外與一般民衆絕無關係。三則在此形格勢禁之下。絕少其他軍隊之援應。世界未有內部不齊一。而能對外作戰者也。頃者馮氏已自覺不能長久支撐。而表示移居張北矣。將就此收蓬。就其所謂林墾督辦乎。抑仍招兵買馬。以圖再舉乎。或暫息影休養以待時機乎。此固爲馮氏個人出處問題。吾人殊未能代為懸測。惟此後之察哈爾。危險正多。外力之侵逼且勿論。即此政治軍事之前途。亦有待於積極之努力。　　第一。察省本爲窮苦之區。農村經濟。旣乏穩固確實之基礎。內蒙一帶。尙滯留於牧畜時代。民八以還。外蒙貿易之道旣塞。牧畜所得。不能週轉餘裕。而平綏。北寗兩路。非但無所謂交通之便。且其捐稅。較民十以前。無慮重過三倍以至十倍以上。漢蒙商賈。均爲裹足。一般社會。更無活路。是以今日之善後問題。第一須就人民凋敝之狀况。速尋生活之出路。　　第二。馮氏直屬部隊。本不甚多。處置或尙不至甚難。而其所收編之雜軍。如正式改編。彼輩未必肯受嚴格之訓練。如任其自去。則非資爲敵用。即貽害民間。關係甚大。故此後各種雜色部隊。如何安插。是乃軍事當局之責。亦新近赴張之宋哲元氏所應注意者也。　　第三·我國每經一度混亂。則一切交通。如以機械爲動力之汽車火車。以至人畜推動之手車馬車。莫不遭逢極度之破壞。此種形勢。自民國十四年曹吳政變以來。每况愈下。論鐵路則亂雜無章。車行無時。貨運幾無法律之保障。　牲畜則牛馬缺少。耕種亦感困難。際此軍事告一段落。積極設施。固一時不易�有成。而消極的交通運輸。直接有助於地方之開發。間接有補於行政之施設。亦頗重要。故整理鐵路交通。淸還運軍車輛。速釋徵發之牲畜。亦爲善後問題中之急待實現者也。　　上述諸端。祗須地方當局有實行之决心。具爲國爲民之誠意。奮起努力。不難於三個月內次第實施。今日在察哈爾區域內之最大困難。厥爲日本軍閥。指揮僞軍。濟以餉械。使進擾察省沿邊各地。倖而勝則節節侵蝕。由多倫至沽源。由沽源趨獨石口。不幸而敗。彼又退入日軍保護界內。於是我感應付窮促。而敵則進退自如也。且日人鬼伎百出。丨此時日閥因內部硬軟兩派爭執不决之故。對華北尙未有具體表現。一旦戰略决定。彼再利用亡淸招牌以作傀儡。對文化水準較高之人。固無法可施。而於經濟衰落之內蒙民衆。則可加以煽惑。引動蒙人之離異。此在察局善後諸事中。所最應一致注意之事。今日要務。在勿令察哈爾再蹈熱河故轍。縱我爲實力所限。一時不能收復失地。然亦必須堅守現陣地。整肅一切力量。以待機興復也。南洋僑胞紛紛返國投資　　海外宣傳顯著效果　　新加坡爪哇華僑現又有一批、道出新加坡、前返祖國、擬投資於中國實業、海外華僑事務局宣傳之漸著效果、於此可見一斑、其中有華僑一人、擬在上海創辦製糖廠及百貨商店、專銷國貨、聞中國當局對於返國華僑之投資、將予以特殊利益、以保護其資本出品及個人安全、且特設僑民事務所、予以招待、並備諮問、（十日路透社電）吉林義軍活躍　　（哈爾濱）　吉林省東部虎林一帶蟠踞之義軍約五千、最近由某國接收軍械甚多、統始積極反滿行動、因此日「滿」當局决定斷然討伐方針、業已開始行動、吉林警備軍廣瀨騎兵部隊及僞國江防艦隊由水陸兩方面進攻、企圖一舉殲滅、（十日日聯社電）　　（哈爾濱）　八月六日下午五時、義軍一隊突然襲擊中東路東段之石頭河子、火車出軌、廣瀨旅團長·矢野參謀及小松原特務機關長一行十數人、一時陷入重圍、幸得救援部隊早到、否則日軍要人悉數陣亡（華聯社通訊）駐瑞士新使遞國書　　瑞士熊城中國駐瑞士新公使胡世澤、今日晋謁許德施大總統呈遞國書、大總開當予延見、經過情形、悉依國際慣常儀式云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）意飛行隊完成壯舉羅馬籌備盛大歡迎　　凱旋門沿途滿佈桂枝　　全城懸旗燃電炬誌慶　　巴爾波定今日率隊離葡返國　　▲哈瓦斯十日羅馬電意大利飛機隊飛行成功、行將回意、汛擊黨及航空俱樂部積極籌備歡迎、由公斯旦丁凱旋門、至威利斯廣塲沿途地上將滿佈桂枝、巴爾波將軍及各駕駛員由凱旋門經過之時、婦女團代表將往獻花、砲隊鳴砲、敎堂鳴鐘、全城懸旗、夜間各大機關燃燈彩致慶、並於城中高處、以電燈編成「墨索里尼」、照耀空中、俾羅馬四周、均能見之、　　▲路透十日里士本電今日意大利飛行隊指揮巴爾波將軍稱、意大利飛行隊須於本星期六日始克起程飛返意國、蓋彼等須候因跌致死之機師史圭格里之遺體抵此、始行起飛、巴爾波將軍今日對記者追叙由泳島至拉布剌達飛程之經過、蓋該段爲全程中最感困難之一、蓋以前無人曾經此段路程、凡飛行家皆須先至格林蘭、而後赴拉布剌達也云云、今日下午巴爾波將軍以橫渡大西洋之獎章分贈各飛行員、各人受章後、皆呼墨索里尼萬歲三聲、其次由巴爾波將軍吻各機師兩次、然後即靜默兩分鐘、紀念史圭格里、據敎皇聖城之電訊、意飛行隊在未停落於奧斯蒂亞前、將飛於聖城之空際、然後由敎皇召見巴爾波將軍、　　▲哈瓦斯十一日柏林電意大利飛機隊飛行之成功、引起普魯士總理戈林氏對德國地位之悲觀、戈氏以爲「德國將受外國飛機强暴及任意之蹂躪」、此係戈林對其本人所屬言論機關「國民日報」記者發表之意見、戈氏因此已命令德國各城巿組織防空演習、該報記載戈氏之意見、略云、「意大利航空部長巴爾波將軍之飛行、可證明一事、即德國無軍用飛機、故其他國家一日不决定自行裁軍、則德國一日不能自保、德國將不斷要求設置防禦、飛機之權」、戈林又謂、南方路綫、於歐洲及北美兩洲大陸之空中聯絡、最爲相宜、大約將來必採亞索爾羣島之路綫、而於美洲及亞索爾羣島之間、設立浮島兩座、以爲停留之用、　　▲哈瓦斯十一日羅馬電意大利飛機隊由葡萄牙京城飛回意國時、所採路線、現已决定如下、出發後先由達奇河入海處飛過、然後經由聖文珊海角·脫拉法伽海角·沿加狄克斯港右方海岸、經過直布羅陀海峽、而達地中海之巴列牙爾羣島進發、其後再由該島出發、經過亞西那拉島博尼發西海峽及瑪特蘭那島、而向意大利奧斯第港飛行云、法飛行家功成遄返馬賽　　▲哈瓦斯十一日巴黎電法國飛行家柯杜與羅西二人、昨日由叙利亞出發、業於昨晚飛抵馬賽、自由邦藍衫隊被繳械　　領袖公然宣布法西斯主義　　今日舉行反政府示威游行　　▲國民十一日柏林電愛爾蘭自由邦沃杜斐將軍語新聞訪員、謂渠之藍衫隊全被繳械、沃氏復聲明、渠擬建設法西斯無國會的國家、舊日之國會制將代以職團議會、凡農工實業科學美術、各界均得以代表加入、此間政界現信伐勒拉之地位、殊爲阽危、蓋藍衫隊旣與爲敵、而前主席柯斯格萊夫之反對黨亦與牴牾、加以愛爾蘭共和軍中復雜有社會黨共產黨份子、南愛人心日形驚惶、因各方所有之軍械子彈無人知其確數也、近數月來外間謠傳有可疑之船隻、在愛爾蘭海濱起卸軍械子彈甚夥、當局曾發見私藏軍火案數起、所抄獲者多爲小機關槍云、　　▲國民十一日杜白林電藍衫隊員現紛抵此間、準備於星期日列隊游行、以紀念先烈、屆時將有何事變、未能逆料、沃杜斐將軍今日第一次在國會公然宣布渠主張法西斯主義、以故人心益見緊張、搜查共黨德希黨越瑞境　　瑞士檢察長開始澈查　　如屬犯界將向德抗議　　▲路透十日巴塞爾電近有德國國社黨員一隊入瑞士境、搜查半在德境半在瑞境之電氣廠巡夜者之住處、瑞士檢察長現開始澈查此案、據傳該巡夜者被疑表同情於共產黨、但搜查後僅得德國共產黨之報紙一份、運動會所發之日歷一份、各方面及各種報紙皆稱、如澈查後果爲德人犯界、則當即向德政府提嚴重抗議、德國仇奧行動　　歐洲各國引爲殷憂　　正注視希政府能否守信　　▲路透十日倫敦電海外國社黨之活動、仍使歐洲各國爲之殷憂、哈璧黑最近在慕尼黑所發抨擊奧政府之播音演說、倫敦外交界皆目爲嚴重事件、惟希特勒最初爲博羣衆贊助起見所採之地位、欲一時罷棄、殊感困難、此節各國亦加原諒、故不欲屈抑德政府、或使其工作更增困難、今消息靈通者之意見、以爲哈璧黑未必不收到柏林所發停止干涉奧國事務之訓令云、現各方面均密切注視德政府之行動、觀其是否守信、目下之事態、衆意尙不必由英法立即會商應付方法云、日漁船被扣案解决　　▲日聯社十一日東京電蘇俄官憲扣留朝鮮漁業組合漁船六艘、由日政府提出嚴重抗議、已達兩三次、據外務省十一日接駐海參崴總領事代理公電稱、蘇俄裁判廳判决漁船六艘全部釋放、而在保塞灣交還日本、因此本案已得圓滿解决、美棉售與日方政府竭力否認　　（南京）　五千萬美金棉麥借欵、有一部份售與日商之說、政府方面、竭力否認、（十一日專電）民參會應否召集取决五全大會　　（南京）　某立法委員談、國民參政會應否定期召集、及從緩成立、須俟五全大會决定、如全會議决提出召集國民大會、則參政會即無召開必要、否則距規定國民大會之期、尙有一年餘、國民實有參政需要、此次廬會曾一度討論、大家意見均是如此、（十一日專電）全國經濟委會準備擴大組織　　（南京）　全國經濟委員會籌備處、自成立以來、關於重要建設、如水利公路等事項均以籌備處名義、主持其事、最近關於美棉麥借欵、及國聯與我國技術合作派遣來華、恊助交通衛生等專員、亦係由該會名義接洽、聞爲統一事權起見、將擴大組織、正式宣告成立、至隸屬問題、聞亦有相當變更、候請中政會通過决定、（十一日專電）靑海民衆代表昨在參部請願　　（南京）　靑海漢蒙回藏民衆請願代表祁中道·馬紹武·敏珠爾等、十日乘機抵京、即赴蒙藏會謁見石靑陽、及行政院褚民誼、十一日晨赴參部謁賀耀組、陳述靑海民衆歡迎中央開發西北及反對孫殿英率部墾殖靑海西區等祁、定十二日再赴蒙藏會謁石、詳陳一切、候謁汪院長後、即赴贛謁蔣委員長、（十一日中社電）</p>

<p>據方氏談、謂對此實難讓步、故已於昨日批示駁斥、稅署當局所以將公賣辦法取消、而另訂定額稅者、其動機實由各省商人之籲請、蓋過去公賣辦法之弊賣、人所共知、卽稅務署於去年將公賣局歸併以來、曾加切實整頓、終因積習甚深、一時無法改善、重因商民之籲請、乃有改革之計劃、此定額稅之所由產生、而公賣制之藉以撤廢也、此舉實爲稅署澄淸積弊與解救商民痛苦起見、我人以過去公賣制之情形而言、過去公賣制度、係屬視貨價而定納稅上貴賤、所有納稅名目、旣極繁夥、而完稅票據、旣有部發、又有局印、每一稅單、類由公賣局自行塡具、自一元或至千元、均可任意塡寫、此中遂大有文章可做、商民納稅、旣可任收稅員之喜怒而决其多寡、而所收捐稅、尤難涓滴歸公、今定額稅之舉、係頒行一種完稅證、彷彿郵局郵票、視重量之多寡、貼稅額之高下、一次完納、手續已竣、茍非出省、决不重徵、商民旣可無手續之繁、目納稅又有規定、而財部稅收、亦可涓滴歸公、不謂自經施行、一部份商民誤會事實、加以反對、其中有經解釋而明瞭者、固不乏人、但盲從附和者、亦所在而有、但正當商人、則多表示明瞭、目已樂予接受、故日來雖有停釀停運之說、但依章納稅者仍所在而有、稅署對於商人此舉、固不能必其是否有人煽動、但亦不能謂爲必無他種用心、惟跡其舉動、當尙可原、故除分別解除外、並表示稅率施行、如有手續過繁或他種不便之處、儘可於不背原則之下、到署申說、稅署必樂予接受、若屬恃衆要挾、則稅署亦决不爲其恐嚇面撤銷原議、查稅署各種稅率、施行以來、均無間言、如啤酒一項、外商最多、彼等均依章納稅、並無留難、豈有本國商人、反有不明瞭內容而任意阻撓者、又此次稅率、同時施行者選蘇浙皖贛鄂豫閩七省、其他各處、均無反對、乃此處爲然、從可知此項稅率之究否有無增加商民負担之處矣云云、</p>
<h3>稅務署批</h3>
<p>稅務署昨發滬、寗蘇酒業菸業、同業公會聯合會批示云、呈悉、查特別印照、係北政府時代留遺之惡習、此次改定稅制、剔除積弊、劃一徵收、該項印照、斷無保留之理、土酒定額稅、照章應核實稽徵、經徵機關、旣不能額外苛索、商人方面、亦不得干涉少繳、以上兩點、首據該公會遞呈請願、業經部批詳加駁斥、茲將批詞一併抄發閱看、又該公會原函所稱、新稅妨害業務、究係如何妨害、並無一語聲叙理由、無從核批、該聯合會前呈貢獻意見、已令行江蘇印花菸酒稅局飭去照在案、總之、本署爲整理稅收起見、新章事在必行、所有商人、認爲手續困難、凡屬無悖原則者、已經本署飭局酌予變通、體恤商情、不爲不至、該公會何得堅持私見、不問事理之當否、報以停運停釀爲非分之要挾、　　破壞稅制之整理、實屬不合、至營業自由、不能受人干涉、該公會竟聲明通函各坊職工停工作、並遵派多人分叚監視、如果實行、迹近妨害同業、阻撓稅政、須知此種舉動、實已逾越公會法規、所規定之範圍、應速自行糾止、如仍無理取鬧、本署惟有依法辦理、决不姑寬、該聯合會旣爲各菸酒同業所組織、當能深明大義、仰轉知各該商一體知照、是爲至要、此批、</p>

<p>招商南棧三德堂地產</p>
<h3>抵押期滿决備欵贖回</h3>
<p>贖價廿五萬七千元</p>
<p>本月十五日即到期</p>
<p>招商局南棧產業中、有一部份爲法敎會三德堂地皮、前年春間、因租期屆滿、三德堂欲收回該產、當時由代理總辦蔡子平辦理交涉、幾經艱難、始由局內收買、而作抵押、但迄未過戶、今以租押之期又到、三德堂拒絕賡續抵押、局方祗得備欵取贖、過戶登記、將歷年未决之糾紛、根本解决、茲將詳情查報如下、</p>
<p>地產查金利源碼頭一帶法字六</p>
<p>十九號甲地、位於局產之間、又法冊七四號甲六四號之地產、其面積毘連南棧碼頭、建造貨棧、因位置重要、向法敎會三德堂租用、其六九號甲地共占有地皮一畝一分、另爲現在金利源貨棧之一部、昔因三德堂不允出售、而由局租得、至民國</p>
<p>二十年春、始因欠租、發生收回地皮糾紛、引起重大交涉、</p>
<p>收買此事發生、尙在趙鐵橋被刺時、交部航政司長蔡培奉命來滬、代理總辦、即出與法總領事向三德堂進行交涉、將該地產由局備欵購買、同時繳付欠租、磋商多月、至是年七月二十四日、方將該地講妥、由局買進、計一畝一分六厘八、共給地價銀二十七萬五千輛、當時訂立買契、同至法領署登記、惟仍沿用三德堂戶名、未予過戶改名、</p>
<p>抵欵蓋當時因局內財政困難、一時付不出如許巨欵、乃仍向三德堂磋商抵押與該敎會、重立契約、押銀二十二萬兩、以兩年爲期、期滿後、雙方均得自由續押或解約、上月內、招商局劉總理以</p>
<p>三德堂抵押期將滿、照約派員與法人磋商、延長抵押期間、而爲三德堂所拒絕、以巴黎總堂未有權授與滬堂、故不能擅訂、責成如期解約、</p>
<p>贖取昨日、劉總經理以三德堂押欵、至八月十五日滿期、共押二十二萬兩、除付過四萬兩外、應備十八萬兩往購、連利息結計、共須繳欵二十五萬六千七百八十六元零四分、該處地產重要、而</p>
<p>抵押到期、祗有二三天、亟須贖取、惟需</p>
<p>欵至巨、遂由劉鴻生提請理事會、陳明與三德堂交涉經過、實難再延、應購之欵、更須即日措備繳付、庶可將此久年糾紛之地產、實行由局收回、並於贖回後、即辦理過戶登記等手續、</p>
<p>巿商會公布調解</p>
<h3>點春堂產權爭執經過</h3>
<p>丨現已宣告破裂雙方準備起訴丨</p>
<p>本巿糖業同業公會與海味業同業公會、因點春堂產權爭執一案、經上海巿商會召集調解、議有辦法三項、茲因調解已告破裂、雙方均準備法律進行、特由商會公布詳情如下、</p>
<h3>海味業公會遷入點春堂</h3>
<p>海味雜貨同業公會、於八月一日呈報巿商會云、呈爲遷移辦公處所、請予鑒</p>
<p>核備案事、竊屬會辦公處本設於第二特區舟山路十號、茲因該處房屋期滿、經執監聯席會議</p>
<p>議决於七月三十日遷回邑廟點春堂原有會所辦</p>
<p>公、以資便利、理合備文呈請鑒核、准予備案、實爲德便、謹呈、</p>
<h3>糖業公會請求商會公斷</h3>
<p>糖業同業公會請求巿商會公斷函云、逕啟者、查敝會會所、本在福佑路一六八號、執有二五九七號土地執業證爲憑、其爲敝會之所有權、至爲明確、民國十九年敝會興辦糖業小學、乃將是處房屋、除留出一間、作爲辦公室外、其餘均作學校使用、是以門首除掛敝會牌子外、復懸有糖業小學之校牌、詎本月二十九日上午十時許、有自稱海味業公會之人、率領多人、蜂擁而至、突將敝會所撥作學校使用之敎育</p>
<p>膳室、及女敎員宿舍、暨印刷所等處、强行佔據、聲言爲其辦公處、並將携帶大宗器具、配置於上開房屋內、所有原在該室等之學校傢具、悉被　棄戶外、且將該會牌子掛於門首、當時敝會職員、向其剴切說明、庸知所來之人、聲勢汹汹、不可嚮　、其時敝會覺於暴行之下、無可理喻、乃卽據情呈報該管一區二分所、請求迅予制止不法行爲、敝會正在靜候之際、而該自稱海味業公會諸人、更於昨日上午、召集數十人、盤踞敝會會所、開會聚餐攝影、暢所欲爲、似此橫蠻侵佔、實屬不法已極、原可訴之於法、治以應得之罪、</p>
<p>但敝會以其自稱爲海味業公會、自必爲貴會之會員、而敝會又在貴會領導之下、爲此陳請主持正義、迅予公斷、否則敝會產權所在、决當依法起訴、迫切奉懇、敬祈鑒察、</p>
<h3>巿商會召集調解結果</h3>
<p>巿商會據糖業公會請求後、卽於三日下午召集調解、並將調解結果、分函該兩公會查照函云、前准貴會（糖業公會）來函、爲海味業公</p>
<p>會强佔該公會會所、請予公斷等由、據此、茲由</p>
<p>本會分函約期八月三日下午召集雙方談話、是</p>
<p>日出席代表糖業爲鄭澤南·徐景福·二人、海味業爲邵　興·葛維廣·等五人、調解結果、爲㈠在調解期內、雙方停止法律進行、㈡請雙方於三天</p>
<p>之內將有關係之各項證據、繳到商會、由會擬定碑記、再經雙方同意後辦理、㈢其餘問題、俟碑記擬就後、經雙方同意、再商辦法云云、當經各代表贊同紀錄簽各在卷、除分函外、合將經過情形、函達查照、</p>
<h3>海味業函請制止勒遷</h3>
<p>海味雜貨同業公會、於　日續函巿商會云、（上略）敝會遵於本月五日將證件送請貴會審核在案、詎意談糖業　託貴會調解爲名、一方則揑詞朦蔽公安局、令行一區二分所勒令敝會遷出、如此毒辣手段、不特對調解此案、毫無誠意、卽對貴會三方議定案、亦卽推翻、倚勢壓迫、殊堪髪指、今該會旣無誠意、敝會爲維持產權計、不得已惟有訴諸法律、意非我開、應請貴會發還前送證件、並祈主持公道、至爲公便、</p>
<h3>巿商會致巿公安局函</h3>
<p>巿商會卽於八日函巿公安局、令知該管區所、在調解期內、暫勿接受任何一方之請求、有所行動、以免調解破裂、又同日分函糖業及海味業兩公會云、逕啟者、接海味業公會來函、糖業公會來函、糖業公會侵佔點春堂公產一案、</p>
<p>於調解擬有辦法以後、又蒙蔽公安局令行一區二分所勒遷、是對於三方議定之案、倚勢推翻、惟有訴諸法律等情、查此事關於各項證據、旣由兩公會遵議送會、應照調解辦法第二項、由本會擬定碑記後再商辦其餘問題、暫時勿再有任何行動、致將本會調解之局、歸於破裂、是爲至要、</p>
<h3>糖業公會請中止調解</h3>
<p>糖業公會於十日函巿商會云、前陳請鈞會公斷海味業爭奪敝會產權一案、曾蒙先從初步調解在案、旋於七日接奉大函、末有暫時勿再有任何行動等語、茲聞海味業公會昨忽咨請鈞會函電公安局、對敝業所辦糖業學校、前所呈</p>
<p>准該局勒遷該會强佔房屋之擊、要求從緩執行、而鈞會竟已核准照辦、敝會認爲有違反再有任何行動之語、跡近偏袒、且海味業公會本咨鈞會已訴諸法律之表示、敝會於此案、故亦準備法律解决、應請鈞會中止調解、卽祈察照外、並請卽轉公安局查照爲何、</p>
<h3>巿商會復糖業公會函</h3>
<p>巿商會據糖業公會函請後、除將本案辦理經過、函達巿公安局外、並函復該公安局云、本月十日、接展來函、以點春堂案請中止調解等情、自可照辦、除將前繳各項證據發還外、已同時知照海味業公會矣、惟來函以本會致函公安局從綏執行、指爲跡近偏袒、殊屬失之誣蔑、查當時議定調解辦法三項、本有在調解期內停止法律進行之語、蓋以此種處置、適使爭議擴大、與調解根本不相容、此項停止法律進行、爲調解中應有之辦法、本會七日之函、不過照案將調停辦法通知雙方、卽函請公安局暫緩執行、亦係根據調解原議辦理、無非欲不爲已甚、使雙方有言歸於好地步、乃來函不但指斥海味業、並且懷怨本會、足徵挾有成見、非復可以情喻矣、曷勝腕歎、</p>

<p>箱屍案變幻莫測</p>
<h3>陳巧英尚在人間</h3>
<p>巧英昨晨赴日領署聲明本人未死</p>
<p>生平亦未嘗有愛人四十餘人之多</p>
<p>丨巧英面目娟好與佐籐同攝一影丨</p>
<p>上海丸箱屍案、初據日人電傳、係在橫濱山下町中國理髪師陳永源之妻陳巧英、並言其生前有愛人四十餘名、今之上海丸輪鐵箱中女屍、即爲其被殺之眞身云云、自十日證物到滬後、昨日突有眞名陳巧英者、赴日領署證明本人並未被害、離奇古怪、則箱中屍體、當非陳巧英而另有一人、决無疑義、茲將昨日消息查報如下</p>
<p>陳巧英出現</p>
<p>昨日上午、突有年齡在二十三歲之女子一名、至本埠日本總領事館、證明本人名陳巧英、原爲橫濱山下町陳永源理髪匠之妻、原籍揚州、因在日本甚久、故能說日本話、渠在日領署內陳述其離東歸國以及與夫離異</p>
<p>之情形時、操極流利的日語述之、末言本人並無有人欲謀害、而上海丸中之箱屍、當爲另一女子、絕對不是陳巧英、</p>
<p>上月內歸國</p>
<p>陳巧英言、渠在日本並無如日人所傳、有愛人四十餘名、蓋彼在東洋交好之男友、不過三人、今之日人</p>
<p>所言、完全不確、渠在日本、與丈夫陳永源感情、已發生裂痕、故雙方提出離異、而本人與陳永源在離婚時、均依照本國法律、呈報駐日之我國領事、以證明與陳</p>
<p>永源脫離夫婦關係、此次歸國、因叔母死亡、故於七月二十六日從日本乘筑波丸三等室來滬、</p>
<p>到滬後行動</p>
<p>陳巧英又言、渠由日到滬後、即至九江路找尋叔父、寄居彼處、原擬伴叔母靈柩同赴揚州一行、惟因在日本行程怱促、有許多衣件未曾帶回、後去信托由東歸國之徐順林帶回上海、而徐亦乘筑波丸輪於本月九日到滬、本人爲取衣之故、迄今尚在滬上、猶未赴揚、女又言、由橫濱動身歸國時、愛人三名、均到埠送行、約回國事畢之後、再往日本、以叙舊好、陳女衣白絲織品旗袍、截髪左右分梳、面目甚娟好、當時日領署之佐籐刑事部長、與之同攝一影、</p>
<p>日警官調查</p>
<p>自陳巧英出現之後、則此案於前所目、爲已有頭緒者、乃又根本推翻、關於被害人者究屬何人、迄尚不知、現上海日領署警探候本月十五日神戶水警署之林刑事課長來滬、（係乘長崎丸輪至上海）後、再行會同進行偵查、務將此案之眞相查明、惟據裝運此箱之上海旅行案內之七號碼頭工人言、當時交</p>
<p>運此箱之人、係一年約三十五六歲之中國男子、其他亦別無可以取證者、</p>
<h3>英人華女糾紛</h3>
<p>究竟其父母有無同意</p>

<h3>京滬綫二等臥車即將實現</h3>
<p>丨上舖二元半下舖三元丨</p>
<p>京滬滬杭甬鐵路管理局、爲便利旅客、發展業務計、擬闢設二等臥車、記者昨日因此特向該局探悉、不久即將實行、茲將所得消息錄下、</p>
<p>籌辦動機兩路局以京滬線臥車、向來祗有頭等、致中產階級人士、無力享用、且每輛祗客十六人、輙不敷供應、在上海北站、每</p>
<p>常有十餘人欲頭等臥舖而不可得、尤以京滬站與鎭江南京間夜車之二等乘客、平均每日在百人以上、其間必有一部份人需要臥舖、今頭等臥舖、旣尙不敷、茍得二等臥舖、尙可稍資補充、乘客不致有向隅之感、在路局以頭等臥車舖位固定、旣不適用於畫間、以車輛言、亦太不經濟、因此最近路局呈准鐵道部、轉飭機務處仿美式樣籌築二等臥車、</p>
<p>臥車構造現在興造中之二等臥車、其造價除平底係用現有六十八尺長度車底架製造不計外、所有車身、全用上乘柚木、連車內</p>
<p>一切設備、所需每輛每在五萬元、式樣仿照美國、每輛分上下臥舖、可容二十八人、在畫間卸去舖位、又可佈置五十六乘客之坐位、於旅客旣多便利、於鐵路亦復經濟、</p>
<p>舖位價目至於二等臥車舖位價格、路局將來擬即依照、部頒客運通則、定爲上舖每位二元五角、下舖三元、惟此僅爲舖位之價、如二等乘客赴京、需要下舖、即於乘車票價上再加三元、即可享用二等臥車矣、現該車建造即將工竣、不久即可實行、</p>
<h3>南巿竊電巨案破獲</h3>
<p>丨職員工匠勾同一氣丨</p>
<p>朱少圻注意偵查</p>
<p>偵緝員大爲出力</p>
<p>本年公共租界捕獲竊電巨案、曾哄動一時、茲者上海巿公安局偵緝隊、復於前日破獲是項竊電巨案一起、其內幕係電料店勾串華商電氣公司內部職員、專代南巿各大商號、設法竊電、藉取酬勞費、瓜分化用、茲將調查所得各項詳情、分誌於後、</p>
<p>遭竊未獲南巿一帶巿民所用電氣、均由華商電氣公司供給、惟有一般不肖之徒、勾串各大商號及居戶、共同竊電、以致華商電氣公司、每月爲人竊電、而致受損失、達數萬元之譜、且因各該商號居戶竊電方法、甚爲巧妙、故十數年來、雖經公司方面、一再通告懸賞緝拿竊電之賊、惟從未聞有破獲者、</p>
<p>整頓竊電惟自該公司車務科主任朱少圻調任燈務科主任後、內部一切大加整頓、且對於是項竊電事實、尤加注意、並經數月之偵查、始行偵悉小東門民國路明星電料店、及城內康家衖四十四號王耀記電料店、名義上專賣電料、及代裝電燈、其內幕實係專代南巿各大商號及店戶、行竊電流之兩總機關、奈因缺乏相當證據、無法破獲、</p>
<p>易泰不到會有蘇州人易泰者、向在華商電氣公司燈務部內充當職員、專軋火表箱所封之鉛印、本年復調至票務股內辦事、本年三月間、因朱主任正在嚴密偵查竊電之時、對於內部職員之行動、尤特別注意、故該易泰不知如何突然不到公司、惟該公司亦不介意、一面仍呈請巿公安局、飭屬注意通緝竊電之賊、</p>
<p>得主要犯文局長據呈後、即通令所屬各區所隊、一體遵照從嚴查緝、直至近日、始由該局偵緝隊領班高萬生、偵緝員時永泉、兩人、嚴密偵查之下、始行偵悉是項竊電人犯中、主要者即係該公司燈務科票務股內不告而辭之職員易泰、惟該易泰行踪詭秘、住無定處、但睱時輒往四馬路畫錦里一林春茶樓上啜茗、</p>
<p>茶樓啜茗乃即報告隊長、加派領班王愼卿、帶同偵緝員沈文達·焦寶鈞·等於前日下午七時許、化妝工人模樣、按址前往一林春茶樓上、假充茶客、據桌啜茗、未幾、果見易泰施旋而來、遂一擁上前、將易拘獲、帶入捕房、略加訊問後、即</p>
<p>迎提到隊、</p>
<p>接洽竊電由隊長預審時、據易供年二十六歲、家居徐家匯路第四十二號</p>
<p>、會有本地人葉裕森者、乳名阿小、向在小東門開設明星電料店、近來串同唐家</p>

<p>其店中工匠童家良等、與小東門鴻章綢緞局經理胡振寳、及小南門中華浴室、城內萬源祥皮貨局、一大襪廠等接洽竊電辦法、</p>
<p>開箱退碼各該商號見有利可圖、當亦樂而允許、遂於每月月終、當華商電氣公司職員前往抄表時、先由易等前往將火表箱上所封之鉛印撬去、開箱後、即將字碼倒退畢、將箱關閉、並用預先僞造之鉛印裝好、以致毫無影踪、殊難察破、</p>
<p>內外聯絡且葉等惟恐發生意外之事、並爲使各該商號信任此項竊電、華商電氣公司內之人、亦均知悉、可保無虞計、乃由我及公司內工匠徐福生張平生等聯絡、使內外連成一氣、並可隨時探聽公司中一切情形、</p>
<p>酬勞費額統計我等竊電經過、爲時共三個月、所得酬勞費、計中華浴室三個月共計洋五十六元、鴻章綢緞局兩</p>
<p>個月計洋一百四十元、一大襪廠三個月計洋一百元、萬源祥皮貨局兩個月計洋</p>
<p>八十元、此項酬勞費、均已瓜分化用等語</p>
<p>逮獲多人當復派原班偵緝員馳</p>
<p>往華商電氣公司內、將工匠張平生拘住、惟徐福生已因故被歇、住址不明、無從拘捕、旋又往明星及王耀記兩電料店內、先後將童家良王耀記兩人一併拘獲、惟尙有主犯葉裕森等、則已聞風逃避踪、致未獲住、當將所獲人犯帶回隊中、</p>
<p>張平生供詰訊時、據張平生供年二十六歲、南匯人、家居浦東爛泥渡八十</p>
<p>六號、向在華商電氣公司燈務科裝表股爲工匠、本年春間、我在小東門國產商場修理電燈時、由童家良介紹、得與葉裕森相識後、葉因其店中生意淸淡、即呌我請</p>
<p>沈科長吃飯、當時沈科長偕同易泰前來吃飯、以致易泰即與葉裕森相識、後來葉即起意僞造鉛印、專代各大商號竊電、並恐發生意外之事、即與我及易泰徐福生等連絡共同行事、所得酬勞、即互相瓜分等語、</p>
<p>童家良供據童家良供、年二十五歲、寗波人、向在小東門明星電料店內爲工匠、葉秋森確是我店老闆、惟因營業不佳、遂將店基出盤與相識之范某、繼續營業、惟葉賦閑在家、經濟上日趨窘迫、乃與我友王耀庭商議、設法竊電、當時適見徐瑞生張平生等在萬源祥皮貨局及一大襪廠內裝置火表、當由我前往接洽偷電辦法、不料徐等一口拒絕、後經數度接洽、徐等方始允許、並介紹與萬源祥皮貨局等相識、遂實行偷電、且與易泰等聯</p>
<p>絡、以廣招徠等語、</p>
<p>王耀庭供詰之王耀庭供、年二十九歲、寗波人、向在康家衖開設王耀記電料店、餘語與易泰童家良等所供相同、當以若輩所代各大藥號偷電、决不止鴻章等四家、遂飭備文先將易等解局訊究、一面飭屬調查其他竊電商家、及追緝在逃各犯、務獲解究、</p>
<p>嘉獎探員華商電氣公司經理陸伯鴻、及巿公安局長文鴻恩等、因偵緝員高萬生等、破獲積有十餘年未破之竊電巨案、殊屬不易、當擬即日給以嘉獎、以資鼓勵、</p>

<p>滬津埠際綱球第日</p>
<h3>鄭兆佳酣戰倫强未結束</h3>
<p>▲鄭失首盤後連勝兩盤天晚今日續賽</p>
<p>▲今日邱飛海戰傑漢生共有三組比賽</p>
<p>津滬埠際綱球賽、於昨日下午在法商總會開幕、上海代表由鄭兆佳代替江道章對天津大倫强比賽、觀者寥寥、是賽原定下午四時半開始、但當二人在塲試拍、準備開始之際、忽烏雲四合、大雨驟至、歷一刻鐘始止、草地會管理人、卽命工役用毛巾拭乾看台、並將篷布拭乾塲地、開賽已五時有餘、鄭兆佳大意失第一盤、而後連取兩盤、因天晚未及續賽、改於今日下午三時前繼續補賽、茂盛績如下、</p>
<p>鄭兆佳（滬）二丨六六丨三六丨一（未完）大偷强（津）</p>
<p>▲競爭形勢大倫强乃一小「大塊頭」、專用斬球、極柔糯如有粘性、鄭兆佳仍用其猛銳之抽球還攻、但斬球不得於抽擊、球每觸死綱下、鄭乃大窘、以二比六失去第一盤、經過是盤之試騐、鄭乃改變戰略、用軟球還擊、專襲邊界、兼以上綱、使大倫强東奔西跑、疲於應付、鄭則指揮裕如、以六比二、六比一連取兩局、博得觀</p>
<p>衆采聲不少、</p>
<p>[丨&gt;天津際網球隊（李尊庸攝）&lt;丨]</p>
<p>▲大意失守開始交鋒、倫强發球勝一局、鄭兆佳發球、被視線員連呌兩次「脚誤」、使鄭頓起戒懼之心、遂影響其智力的運用、大受不利、其實鄭之發球、並無「脚誤」之弊、徒屬視線員之吹毛求疵耳、鄭取回倫强之發球局後、又連失兩局、成一比四、其最大原因、由於鄭不慣對方急轉之斬球、大有力不從心之槪、鄭乃以一比六失首盤、</p>
<p>▲軟功制勝第二盤開始、鄭卽運用極低之球、掃射邊界、一左一右、倫强隨球奔跑、大爲所困、連失兩局、但以下鄭竟又連負三局、鄭乃謹愼從事、專用牛皮筋之軼功窘敵、失誤極少、隨心所欲、指揮如意、使倫强跑得氣喘如牛、時以冰水解渴、鄭則態度如常、毫無迫急之狀、是盤結果、鄭以六比三勝、</p>
<p>▲一瀉千里第三盤開賽、鄭兆佳愈形</p>
<p>得手、重如砲彈之發球、亦一無失誤、誠得心應手、無往不利、倫强雖亦向兩邊攻擊、但鄭已察破對方計謀、故奔跑應付、措置適當、脚步齊整、倫强見計不售、心愈焦急、鄭連勝五局、殊見容易、第三四兩局、且均爲滑四、第六局爲倫强勝、</p>
<p>第七局又　鄭、鄭遂以六比一勝、斯時天已　黑、不及完塲、今日繼續補賽、</p>
<p>▲今日秩序今日下午三時起原有兩組比賽、單雙打各一、因昨日鄭兆佳與倫强之戰、未及完塲、於今日二時續賽、故共有三塲比賽、秩序如下、</p>
<p>鄭兆佳（滬）對大倫强（津）下午二時起</p>
<p>邱飛海（滬）對傑漢生（津）下午三時起</p>
<p>史篤克史規亞（滬）對惠氏否勃（津）下午四時半</p>

<h3>短波發射機之調準法及其步驟</h3>
<p>— 羅靜予</p>
<p>前言</p>
<p>自從「短波」戰勝了今日的宇宙以來，無線電發射機（Transmiter）進展的趨勢，勿論電力的大小，屬於交通事業方面的也好，屬於業餘研究的也好；大多轉向到這一方面來。目之所及，幾乎無不是短波發射機在肩負着我們人類的通訊工作。然而在我們使用者方面，除了工程師或專定的技術人員外，對於發射機的調準方法及其步驟，大都是十分忽略的；這不但在我們的知識上是一個小小的缺點，有時候簡直可以稱做不幸的事情，著者有一位到關外開魯前線抗敵精於報務的友人，便曾是在這一個缺點</p>
<p>之下而喪失了他可愛的生命的！</p>
<p>發射機從應用的方面講來，在今日大抵可以別爲兩大類：第一是單振盪式（Self　Oscillation）第二是復振盪式（Ｍaster　Oscillation）單振盪式是利用一個或兩個眞空管發生振盪，即以此振盪電流直接輸入天線，但是他的週波不甚穩定，尤以大電力及遠程的發射，眞空管本身製造不得不加大，而足致週波不穩之內部電容量的變化，便更難於阻止和减少。至其發報工作方面亦只限於用手，而不能採用快機。不過以其便利，且在小電力及短距通信方面無大妨害，所以今日我們流行採用的，仍然是這一類，復振盪式是以一個較小的眞空管發生振盪，然後經過一段擴大器（Amplifier）及增週率器（Touber　of　Freqency）始將此振盪電流輸入天線；其目的在於使週率穩定。而便於採用快機通報，今日眞茹國際電台等所採用的，便是這一類。</p>
<p>平常我們對於調準底目的解釋，即指發射的效率而言。任何線路的結構，都難免這結構的本身的損失；但是我們於任何綫路，却要他這本身的損失作相對的减少。或者是我們輸入了一定値的電力，而我們却要得着最大的輸出。在事實上，這種效率判別的偵察，我們可以看發射機屏極上米厘安培表及天線上安培表相互的比率便可知道。假如屏極上的數目愈小天線的數目愈大，那嗎便是我們得法的調準，滿意的調準。這兒有一個公式：設Ｅ爲效率，Pi爲輸入電能，Ｐ０爲輸出電能，Ｐ１爲損失電能。則</p>
<p>Ｅ＝Ｐ０—Pi＝Ｐ０—Pi＋Ｐ１</p>
<p>故欲求效率的增高，則公式中之Ｐ０的數目必求其增大。（未完）</p>
<h3>短波收音須知</h3>
<p>— ＲＦ譯</p>
<p>旋轉刻度盤愈慢愈好。</p>
<p>當調節得一徵弱的訊號時，（如噓噓聲）應該細心地調節，結果往往可以聽得很淸晰的播音。</p>
<p>不要以爲收音在晚上最好，短波播音在一天二十四小時內，多是一樣可以很滿意的收到。</p>
<p>遠距離的電台波長在五十公尺以上的，很不容易收得。</p>
<p>日間極難收到波長在三十三公尺以上的遠地播音。所以在日裏度盤上三十三公尺以上的部份，可以不必勞而無功的調節着。（近地電台當然例外）</p>
<p>晚上極難收得波長在二十五公尺以下的遠地播音。所以在晚上度盤上二十五公尺以下的部份，可以不必枉費心機的去調節。（近地電台當然例外）</p>
<p>要收遠地的播音，先應該知道這時候這電台是否在播音，和這電台在度盤上大槪的地位，然後再細心收聽。</p>
<p>當得到短波收音機的第一天，不要希望就能收到遠地的播音，因爲要得滿意的收音成績，是需要相當的調節手法的。不該因爲今天的收音成績不佳而對着你的收音機失望。今天不靈，說不定明天的成績却非常優美。</p>
<p>在熟悉的調節法之後，可以收得許多電台的播音。</p>
<p>要是用了上述的各項手術，而不能得美滿的收音成績，那麼是收音機不佳之故，應該把他改裝一下。</p>
<h3>英國的金屬眞空管</h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>美國的無線電眞空管製造者，正在絞盡腦汁，以求管內屏柵極數目的增加，由三極四極以至五極六極，最近且有七極出世，未來的八極九極：：自在意中。一年以來，新出的式號，增至百數十種，變換之速，使人昨舌。但是英國的眞空管，因爲我們日常很難有接觸的機會，他的發展情形，熟悉的恐極少，英國眞空管改進最顯著的一點，就是竭力設法將玻璃的成份减少，最近已有全金屬眞空管問世，從此眞空管上的難題，可解决不少。</p>
<p>金屬眞空管的構造，簡述之，以一銅質圓管代替普通玻璃管，此圓管即作</p>
<p>爲眞空管的屏極，至於其他柵極陰極等，都裝在此圓管內，其地位排列的關係，與通常眞空管同。此銅質圓管底部，[丨&gt;屏極接頭廉柵隔離罩控制柵屏極玻璃老封固&lt;丨]</p>
<p>與一很短的玻璃部份相封住，圓管內的空氣，即從此抽盡，成很縝密的眞空，各極接線，亦經此玻璃部份引出，眞空管完全的底部的裝置在圓形的橡皮底盤上。</p>
<p>此種構造法的眞空管，　用作强力發報者，在英國已有數年歷史，以作收音用者，尙屬創舉，發報眞空客居，因其屏極消失電力極大，故必須裝置水套，以</p>
<p>水冷却（Water　Cooling），此新式的金屬眞空管，因屏極曝露於外，故僅持空氣的流動，已足足使其冷却有餘，此屏極與玻管間幅射熱的難題，從此得迎刃而解了。</p>
<p>此種眞空管，其堅固程度，遠勝玻管者，因管內各極可用絕緣的分隔器（Insulating　Spacer）緊夾於眞空管兩端，此分隔器又緊貼於屏極圓管的內層，故各極間的距離極一致，不易變動，因</p>
<p>此各管的特性，亦完全相同，製造者曾宣稱：以此管自六呎高度墮於水門汀的地板上，很少有損壞的危險。</p>
<p>此種眞空管之以作通用及强力輸出者，無另外的隔離罩，屏極曝露，冷却的功效益顯，用作高週率放大者，其隔離罩之直經與底盤相等，即緊貼於底盤上，不若美國眞空管的另需隔離裝置。</p>
<h3>怎樣調節最低音部</h3>
<p>— 官質冰</p>
<p>關於調節音調的問題，中國人每每不大注意，其實并不是不願注意而是中國的音樂根本太單調，就如用高音部時，很少間雜着中音部和低音部，簡直可以說沒有。因爲這個原因，所以一般播音台的播音，關於調節一層，只求中國的唱片淸晰足矣，一旦加上兩張西樂唱片，也不會感覺沒有完全播送出去，聽慣了中國音樂的人，就是外國人吧！初聽之也不覺得，其實每每把最低音部截斷無聞而不自知了。</p>
<p>在三個月之前就是上海的西人廣播電台，也未注意到這點，一般的通病是放大了高音部而截去了最低音部。自從五百八十基羅週波之ＺＭＨＹ西人廣播電台，在上海出世，發出了優美悅耳的最低音部的音調，獲得了廣大聽衆的贊許和擁護，於是所有西人的廣播電台，都非常驚訝丨沒有一個不感覺得他過去的調節未適當，而積極的熱計籌思，竭盡全力於此點，從析去調節，果然有些得到了相當的成績，而有些仍繼續在找尋。</p>
<p>我們知道一個電台的優劣，自然在乎發報機的好壞，因爲它好像一個門戶，門戶不好，要它放在出很好的音，自不可能。但這僅能算其中一部分，低週率放大器，在無線電廣播機中，它好像一個咽喉，從一個破壞的咽喉發出的音調，也會破碎不堪入耳，所以低週波放大器我認爲是一個最重要而不可忽視的一部分，關於這點，我再把此次交通部調查上海西人播音台的批評，和一般聽衆的異評，寫在下面，就可以明白低週率放大器也非常重要。</p>
<p>交通部的評判：西人廣播電台中最好的是一千三百基羅週波之ＸＣＢＬ，至於五百八十基羅週波之ＺＭＨＹ，則列居第四，但一般聽衆則以爲ＺＭＨＹ占中西廣波電台中之第一位，ＸＣＢＬ則列居西人廣播電台中之最末一位。這是什麼道理呢？并不是交通部校騐得不當，而是交通部不管音節的好壞，只求發射部分不致影響他人爲原則。而一般聽衆則不管影響他人與不影響，只求其發音淸晰與不淸晰。所以二者之間，便不一致。（未完）</p>
<h3>無眞空管收音機的研究（續）</h3>
<p>— 欽</p>
<p>在這許多專家之中，有一個著名的勃魯司莫根博士。他是一個英國的物理學家，來帮助柏氏，做他的顧問。他在試騐這無眞空管的收音機之後，嘗發表過以下的言論：</p>
<p>「柏屈里克氏發明了不用眞空管與任何那一種燈來收無線電的播音，這對於無線電學術上與無線電聽衆方面，眞是一個最有價値的供獻。假使這偉大的新發明，能在最近的時期內使其實行，那麼每年我們可以節省下六千九百萬元的購眞空管的費用。並且從我的實騐上，證明柏氏所發明的新原理，可以節省下我們平常收音機中所需的一半電力。這種收音機，因爲不須燃點燈絲的緣故，所以當你轉動度盤的時候，立刻就可以聽到播音的節目。祗要你把度盤一轉，就可收以你所需要的電臺，一點也不會遲延，一點也沒有聲音徵弱的弊病。而且我們可以想到這種收音機，因爲它不需眞空管的緣故，所以一切在我們收音機中所有的雜音怪呌的聲音等等，都可以極端的避免，發爲天然婉轉的妙音。這樣經濟與滿意的無眞空管收音機，將來自然應用非常廣大。而對於我們無線電聽衆方面的享樂，也可以增加不少。」（完）</p>

<h3>短波綫圈架之燈腰代用品製法</h3>
<p>— 華玉</p>
<p>買一又四分之一吋直徑之膠木管以備繞線，其長短須視所繞圈數多少而定。再在厚約半吋之木板上用圓規畫一與膠木管同直徑之圓。然後照普通燈脚之地位穿四孔如圖一。每粗孔插一與普通燈脚同之發射機用銅管（約一吋長）。於是以所備膠木管直置木板上，中注以已溶成液體之火漆，如圖二。待其冷固後將木板取下，便成一短波線圈架矣。其底面火漆如若不平，可用銼刀銼光，此法所成之線圈架，旣美觀又經濟，且銅脚之多少及膠木管之長短固不若用舊燈腰之須受限制也。</p>

<h3>自製變壓器的兩個經騐</h3>
<p>— 張國泉</p>
<p>自製變壓器，往往因紙殼做得不堅固，所繞的線，往往容易鬆散出來，這是很可惜的。如在未繞線之前，先塡以細長白布二條，再裹以絕緣紙或布，待繞完，把他緊緊的打個結，便不會有鬆散的弊病了。</p>
<p>插矽鋼片的時候，常常能將紙芯觸破，不幸時，或竟將綫弄斷，豫防方法，亦應在未插矽鋼片之前，先插入比紙芯長些的鐵片二條，置在矽鋼片左右兩邊，露出的兩端把他摺彎。如此插矽鋼片時就可不必担憂了。</p>

<h3>戀愛的信條</h3>
<p>— 瘦鷗</p>
<p>當我所在二十歲左右的時候丨就是所謂毛頭小夥子時代，對於戀愛問題的研究和討論，眞認爲是一件無上的樂事；往往聚着幾個同學，剪燭夜談，談得聽者動容，言者忘倦，寗可明天爬不起，請假逃學。似乎不是這樣努力討論，老婆就會永遠娶不到的樣子。如今回想起來，簡直要羞得連自己的脖子也紅了。</p>
<p>偏是前天在無意中又碰到了兩位正把戀愛在那裏當飯吃的小朋友，他們知道我在本報附刊上寫過一篇大談戀愛的中篇小說！丨「寫給友</p>
<p>人之妻，」以爲我總是一個前輩的戀愛學專家，便當塲執經問難起來</p>
<p>。我先是婉謝不能，却經不起他們，一再請求，終於使我不得不發表了下面這麼一般胡言亂語。</p>
<p>我說：你們如其要研究眞正的戀愛和徹底的戀愛的話，第一便得瞭解戀愛的信條。戀愛的信條是什麼，便是「犧牲」·無論在怎樣的情形之下，當你向一個異性開始戀愛的時候，你同時便得準備作一切的犧牲：不但不能抱什麼主義，而且也不能把結婚或是取到對方的同情作爲最高目標。如果你祗是把結婚作爲你的戀愛的最高目標，那就不能說是戀愛，祗能說是你的養兒子計劃的推進而已。至於對方對於你的戀愛能否接受，能否表示同情，地絕對不應看得太重。祗須問你自己能不能把你所有的熱情完全傾注於對方的身上，則戀愛之能事盡矣。</p>
<p>他們聽了我這一小篇高論之後，大槪因爲我說得過分的奇特的緣故，竟糊理糊塗的附和了</p>
<p>。我當然也是非常得意的。大家便盡歡而散。但是後來我自己仔細想想，不由神明內疚起來了假使普天下的痴男怨女大家都依着我所定的這個信條走，結果一定會發生兩種現象：一種，</p>
<p>是普遍的單戀狂，一種是黃浦江高掛客滿牌。不過這是純粹偏於悲觀方面着想，要如從樂觀方面想起來，又可以說因爲你的戀愛是這樣的眞誠懇摯，必格外的容易引起對方的同情，而成就美滿的結合。完了，兩方面的話，都給我說完了！究竟然乎否乎，？却還得付之公論。</p>
<h3>痧藥水</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>在下層階級裏，在內地甚麼都落伍的鄕村裏，雖然也知道薙頭司務的「挑痧」，有些靠不住，但對於「洋醫院」的急救時疫，也帶着三分「怕」，七分「不信」，於是目一般「仁心濟世」，旣牟利，復慈悲的「科學大家所配製的「痧藥水」爲唯一救命王菩薩。稍微有些頭痛，服「痧藥水」，上吐下瀉，也服「痧藥水」手足冰冷了，還是撬開了牙關，灌「痧藥水」。據說「痧藥水」的「消災延壽」，「起死回生」，比了燒長錠，吃香灰，要靈到萬倍。</p>
<p>「痧藥水」對於時疫，是否不拘輕重，均有絕對的效騐，這個我可不很明瞭。但是觀於巿上「痧藥水」種類之多，銷路之廣，「痧藥水」未必果能把血液已給虎列拉菌完全破滅的軀殼，從新從森羅殿上把魂靈兒搶回來，或許可以在本來不至於一命嗚呼的準霍亂病上見一些效果。宛如夫妻倆爲揑了一把大腿而吵起嘴來，自然經人一勸，便又和好如初。若因「丈夫納妾」，或「妻子犯姦」，那麼和事老唇敝舌焦，也是徒然。「痧藥水」的效力，我看，也就和這和事老差不多。</p>
<p>由於「痧藥水」我就連帶的想起了這年頭兒最通行的「會議」。小之如解决大小老婆爭風吃醋的。「家庭會議」，大老婆，小老婆，互可交換意見，互可提出條件。大之如維持世界和平，穩定世界金融的「國際會議」，大家也可發表意見，談判條件。所以這些「會議」倒也很像「痧藥水」。發痧的人，服了「痧藥水「精神一提、藥到病除。若是服了十滴，還是不濟，那麼二十滴，三十滴。「觀音痧藥水」不見功效，那麼，再服「濟顚痧藥水」。所以「第一次會議」不成功，接開「第二次」「第三次會議」。「北冰洋會議」不成功，改開「南冰洋會議」。一直開會開到都才關閉了，還得撬開了牙關灌「痧藥水」。</p>

<h3>一塊有幻術變化的布</h3>
<p>— 佩英</p>
<p>老娘裴克爾在伊的一所蓋白雪的小屋中，收拾東西，忙忙碌碌。伊是爲了自己的幸福，自己的生活而做這種擦抹桌椅，洗滌器皿等工作。</p>
<p>「只　那隻碗架要揩了，」伊喃喃道，「揩遇了碗架，我好預備做一塊蛋糕當點心吃了。這塊蛋糕，我應該慢慢地吃，只怕在此長時間中，不再有別塊蛋糕，可以充飢了吧。」</p>
<p>刺丨塔丨塔丨刺丨丨塔丨塔</p>
<p>這位老婦人趕快的走到門口去，一邊走，一邊揩乾伊的手。</p>
<p>門口立着一個很有趣很滑稽的小孩子，這種滑稽有趣的樣子，你們從來沒有見過的。他脚上穿一雙長統尖頭的鞋子，頭上戴一頂綠色小帽子，傾覆在後腦上。看上去他是一個十足道地的，擅長惡作劇的頑童。眞的他是個非常頑皮的兒童。他的肩頭套着一隻巨大的空籃子，時時很有趣地旋轉不已。他歌唱道；</p>
<p>「斛斗翻上去！斛斗翻下來。</p>
<p>打發一辨士（註一）！換一克郎（註二）來！」</p>
<p>「哈　！哈　！哈　！」他唱完了末一句，這樣的大笑：他的笑聲眞像一隻有沸水的水鐺裏發出來的聲晋。</p>
<p>「晚安，老娘裴克爾，」他十分客氣的說，脫　下他頭上的帽子，垂頭彎腰的鞠一個躬。「我已經走了像延命菊花瓣一般多的哩數的路了。請你打發我一些東西吃吧！求求你！我是餓極了。」</p>
<p>老娘裴克爾記得伊是有一塊蛋糕的。這個頑童看上去眞的是十分飢餓，當然，伊不能夠老實告訴他說只䞉一塊蛋糕，備以充飢的。</p>
<p>好可憐見兒的！他是何等的飢餓啊！看他的眼睛無時無刻不在轉動，無時無刻不在跳舞！可憐的老娘裴克爾！一剎那間，伊老人家那裏　，連這最後一塊的蛋糕也不䞉了！（小朋友！猜猜看，蛋糕那裏去了？）</p>
<p>「斛斗翻上去！斛斗翻下來！</p>
<p>打發一辨土！換一克郎來」！</p>
<p>這個小孩子戴上帽子預備走去的時候。又伊哦地歌唱着。</p>
<p>「謝謝你，老娘裴克爾！」他很快樂地喊道，同時他把肩頭上的籃子，大大地旋轉。於是他把手伸進籃子去，拿出一方大紅布來。</p>
<p>「請你收受了吧，因爲你是仁慈待人的，」他說，「倘使你需要什麼東西的時候，只要想一想你所需要的這樣東西，把這方布揮動一下，就得了。晚安，再會吧！」</p>
<p>老娘裴克爾走進門來，把空盆子都揩干凈。伊再把一方白枱檯布舖在檯上，這時伊又記得沒有蛋糕䞉下了。突然分看見了方才頑童給伊的一方大紅布，記得他怎樣關照的話。</p>
<p>伊拿起這方在紅布，閉了伊的眼睛，想要有</p>
<p>一個克郎去買蛋糕和別的東西，想完，把布揮上檯去。奇怪，那邊眞的有了一個光芒四射的新克郎！這是幻術了！現在伊可以有許許多多東西吃了。</p>
<p>老娘裴克爾把裝潢水的水鐺子，放在爐子上</p>
<p>。然後帶了伊的籃子，拿了伊的光亮的新克郎出門去，走到村莊上的小店裏，買一塊蛋糕和不少別的好吃東西。當伊回來的時候，聽見水鐺裏有唱歌的聲音！和小孩子所唱的，完全一樣：</p>
<p>「斛斗翻上去！斛斗翻下來！</p>
<p>打發一辨士！換一克郎來！」</p>
<p>（註一；辨士是英國的錢幣，昔爲銅幣，今以靑銅製成。）</p>
<p>（註二；克郎是英國一種値五先令的貨幣。）</p>

<p>「黃葉」入詩，「最饒意象，」舊詩人每喜用之，而東坡的「家住江南黃葉村」句，更是被人稱道。王漁洋對此，也特別感到興味，時時以「黃葉」入詩，如「滿林黃葉雁聲多，」「山予晚啼黃葉中，」都可說是他的警句。在今作家之中，愛好「黃葉」的，也很有人。幾年前，在「一般」雜誌上，曾經看到鍾敬文的一篇「黃葉小談，」他從「紅葉」說到「黃葉，」從「黃葉」說到自己的遭際，很令人感動。但看了那篇文章，我們便知田園詩人生活的幻夢，是被擊得粉碎了；即使是</p>
<p>「黃葉」的享樂，也不能離開「現實」去談。今年，買得李日華的「紫桃軒雜綴，」「又綴，」無意中又看到論「黃葉」的一則，其詞曰：</p>
<p>「黃葉」「落葉」入詩，最饒意象。然其原，本於「洞庭始波，木葉微脫　，」與「亭臯木葉下，隴首秋雲飛。」而唐人剪綴入律，具有情致。如：「黃葉前朝樹，無風寒殿開。」又：「雨中黃葉樹，燈下白頭人。」又：「秋風吹渭水，落葉滿長安。」又：「開門落葉深。」又：「一葉兼營墮。」余西江詩句有：「」</p>
<p>「空山黃葉雨，淺澗白沙流。」又：「寒山秋罄底，落葉夜燈前。」又：「靑山高士榻，黃葉老僧家。」又武林大佛寺倚醉閣題句：「石開黃葉徑，湖展白鷗天。」自謂用得葉字頗穩。適暇日，出以質於黃葉頭陀，頭陀吟味再三，莞爾曰：「初謂此物，堪止兒啼，不意被公拈得，到處解人頤也。」</p>
<p>李日華著作，現已不易訪求，轉錄於此，以告愛好「黃葉」的人。中土詩人，對「黃葉」固如此愛好，在西歐，也常常可以看到關於「黃葉」的詩文。記得有一篇題做「黃葉」的散文詩，就是寫一個男性，以「黃葉」送給他所愛的女性，在第二回看到「黃葉」時，又想起這回事。中土是用「紅葉」題詩，沒有聽過用「黃葉」的；據這一首散文詩，則在西歐，「黃葉」是一樣的可以「寄情。」寫到這裏翻開石川啄木的全集，有「落葉之烟，」「黃的小花，」「黃草」諸題，而以「黃草集」爲一部分詩的總題名，詩人不僅對「黃葉，」就是「黃的小花，」「黃的草，」也是同樣的愛好，在這裏也可以得到一個「實證」了。</p>
<h3>零感</h3>
<p>— 另境</p>
<p>智識份子大槪最容易犯一個毛病，往往把部分的一時的變態的現象，誤認爲全體的根本的代表的現象。</p>
<p>比如，有人說起了第三種人，就有人</p>
<p>出來考訂世界文學家的種別，甚至還引人揭起什麼小資產階級革命文學的旗幟，幾乎弄到像「亞克與人性」裏所寫的要設立起「文學家種別檢定所」來。正如某先生所說的：「人體有胖和瘦，在理論上，是該能有不胖不瘦的第三種人的，然而事實却并沒有，一加比較，非近於胖，就近於瘦。」然而中國何以偏偏有人喊出「第三種人」呢？這是很容易明白的，因爲年來國內的某種主義發展到使人不能自由呼吸，稍稍大意就得窒死，要想堂而皇之來一個深呼吸的，最好聲明自己是不屬於你們兩種以外的第三種，這麼一來，雙方都不向他開罪了。其實這祗是一時的變態的現象，并不是固然有什麼第三種人。</p>
<p>又如，大家正在提倡文化大衆化，希望能產生一點通俗本子，以提供社會大衆開讀。事實上不免有粗製濫造的編述品出現，或者如某君所說的學生一讀ＡＢＣ便算是對某種學問具有心得了，但我們倘使因了不滿意現在的編述品或一般學生那種浮薄心理，就斷然說初步智識的書要不得，文化不必大衆化，這豈不又是大錯！</p>
<p>把部分的一時的變態的現象，誤認爲全體的根本的代表的現象，實在是知識份子最容易犯的一個毛病。</p>
<h3>辭賦與小說</h3>
<p>— 子展</p>
<p>劉復所輯敦煌掇瑣，列韓朋賦晏子賦燕子賦茶酒論等篇於小說，以辭賦入小說自此始，此治目錄學者不可不知，而治文學者尤當注意也。予嘗論宋玉賦，以爲九辯之外，見於文選古文苑者，大抵爲漢魏六朝人所僞託。且以爲此種趣咪濃郁之作，與其稱爲賦，毌寗稱爲小說，是爲中國小說之鼻祖。蓋以韻文小說發生於散文小說之先，在文學發展之進程上可以說得通，而且有線索可尋。三十年前，敦煌石窟發見之李唐五代俗文學，尙有經種韻文小說，即劉復敦煌掇瑣所收者是也。惟韓朋晏子非如宋玉爲歷史上有名之賦家，故無好事之文人，爲之採輯修改，題爲韓朋晏子所作，僅得流傳民間，與小說齊視而已。嚴可均輯先唐文，有劉思眞醜婦賦一篇，似亦民間流傳之韻文小說，如晏子賦茶酒論之類歟？疑非全璧，亦甚可寶。胡適之白話文學史未加採錄，殆未見之也。茲錄於此：</p>
<p>人皆得令室，我命獨何咎。不遇姜任德，正値醜惡婦。才質陋且儉，資容劇嫫母。鹿頭狝猴面，推額復出口。折額厭樓鼻，兩眼顯如臼。膚如老桑皮，耳如側兩手。頭如研米槌，髪如掘掃帚。惡觀厭儀容，不媚如鋪首。闇鈍拙梳髻，刻畫又更醜。妝頰如狗舐，額上偏獨厚。朱唇加踏血，畫眉如鼠負。傳粉堆頣下，面中不偏有。領如鹽鼓囊，袖如常拭釜。履中如和泥，爪甲長有垢。脚皹可容箸，熟視令人嘔。</p>
<p>辭語多不可解，疑爲當時俗諺，抑或字誤。作者劉思眞，爵里未詳。梁有劉之遴，字思貞，未知即其人否？北史陽休之傳，載其弟俊之，多作六言歌辭，淫蕩而拙，世俗相傳，名爲陽五伴侶，寫而賣之，在巿不絕。俊之嘗過巿，取而改之，言其字誤。買書者曰，陽五古之賢人，作此伴侶，君何所知，輕敢議論。俊之大喜。當南北朝，文尙駢麗，而有陽五伴侶及醜媂賦一類通俗文學流行民間，胡聖人白話文學史遺此材料，是一失也。</p>
<h3>曙光</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>混亂沉悶的生活，終於起了激劇的變化；雖然並非是完全出乎自己預料之外的事，但因爲來得太突然，彷彿在生命上感到了重大的打擊，於是爲了生活，便不能不尋求一個新的轉換了。</p>
<p>一個流浪漢似的朋友成了我的侶伴；他伸手領着我進了另一種的生活裏。這生活的特色，便是靑春的力和活躍的生命。</p>
<p>連着三夜，沒有睡眠，我們消度在一家攝影塲裏；看着那些活潑的靑年男女複演着人生的戲，自己彷彿忘盡了一切的痛苦。同着他們談笑和戲謔，使你意識到從心坎裏湧出了生命的火熖。</p>
<p>戲散塲後，强烈的攝影的光熄滅了，開始感到倦呆，許多的演員漸漸都消失在黑暗裏，剩下的只不過是幾個較親近的朋友。於是周圍的氣氛也就變得冷淸了。</p>
<p>我們在那繁星閃燦的天空下，圍坐在一起，斯文地談着話，雖然偶而也會觸那悲哀的情緒，但馬上笑一笑又𨊳�</p>
<p>突然像是有了什麼新鮮的發見似地，一個年靑的女性指一指天空拍着手呌起來。</p>
<p>在隠隠的繁星的天空上，我們看見已經浮起丨層魚白色，曙光將要到這世界上來。</p>
<p>許久遇着昏迷生活的人，是有多少時候沒有望到這美麗的曙光了啊！那芬芳的夏夜的氣息，那魅人的魚肚色的天空，將是怎樣感動了你的心吧。</p>
<p>我彷彿是坐在幻境裏，拾頭望着天，想起許多而且許久沒有想過的事。但是因爲當時的心境，我並沒有領悟那曙光的力。</p>
<p>曙光還不能驅除了那罩在我的心上的暗影。</p>
<p>爲了友情的吸引，第四天的夜裏我讓火車載我到南京來。一個久別而在害着多年肺病的老友，歡欣地迎接了我，而且第一次我見到了那絲毫沒有打算心的單純的友人的妻。</p>
<p>除了病，我的老友是受着極端經濟的窘迫，久別重逢的歡喜沒有支持了許久，相互的憂慮逐漸地使生活變成了沈寂。我時時刻刻担心着他們的病，他們時時刻刻担心着我的渺茫的前途。每到深夜我聽到老友的深沈的咳嗽，心情就變得特別的陰鬱，有時甚至想，爲了他自己，爲了那些愛他的人，如果能夠早日收束了他的生命，不也是一件更幸福的事麼？我明明知道這想頭無異是一種罪過，但我仍禁不住地時常要這樣想！</p>
<p>於是生活又陷在絕望的深淵裏　。</p>
<p>這時，一個健康的而生活也比較富餘的老友救助了我。這個友人，胖胖地，具有豐富的幽默，從來也不談感傷的話，總是使你歡喜。他如果呆呆地不發笑的時候，我總想對着他的肥大的腿打一拳；可是如果他要在歡笑的話，我就總禁不住地想冷不防從背後把他抱起來。</p>
<p>最可喜的是，他也有一個妻，那被人稱爲典雅美麗的女性。她招呼我像招呼她的弟弟一樣，我不記得我曾經看見過她的受氣的面孔，至少對我，她總是微笑着。而望見她的笑，像　是飲了一杯濃厚的蜜酒。</p>
<p>也許人類永是自私的吧，我更多地接近了他們，從他們我不但感到了温情的友愛，而也好像是在吸收着健康的血液。</p>
<p>夜裏獨自一個睡在帆布床上，床臨着窗，團團的月照着我的面孔，心裏感到說不出的平靜，那個老友的痛苦的咳嗽聲，是可以暫時地聽不見了，合上眼就入了夢境。</p>
<p>再醒來的時候，隔着窗又望見那魅人的魚肚色的天空了。靑春的力，生命的火熖，湧在我的胸裏。</p>
<h3>平凡的事（三七）</h3>
<p>— 濬果孫</p>
<p>這時候，之光又有他的新顧慮了；伯唐目下的財力，他是瞭如指掌的，昨夜預備接濟閘北的慷慨，在伯唐已經是勉爲人之所不肯爲，而今天營救雍孫的用途，竟快把伯唐的現欵掃數支訖，於是這兩件事情，竟可以呌伯唐立時置身於涸轍了。這種涸轍，世上有幾個人肯故意呌自己置身其間呢？這種涸轍，世上又有幾個人好開口勸旁人置身其間呢？當然，這其間就發生輕重緩急的選擇了，而伯唐的選擇，無論從情感或者以事情而論，又都是可以預卜的，結果，接濟的計畫决然因此而難於成爲事實！</p>
<p>「這不是定數嗎？」之光獨自思量，「我們用甚麼來打破定數？」</p>
<p>於是他又獨自繞着走廊一往一來地踱個不住了，他不僅忘了這天的氣候遠比昨天晴和，並且也忘了敵機和敵砲的聲浪，究竟是從那一個方向來的！</p>
<p>忽然，汽車沙沙沙的聲音響到門裏來了，之光連忙跑過去看，正望見伯唐從車子裏走出來，而同着他走的，却是長興廠裏的幾個代表。之光立刻感到了「接濟」和「營救」兩件事，就要在幾分鐘之內决勝負了。</p>
<p>然而他們一齊走到飯堂裏坐定的時候，代表們就向之光說；</p>
<p>「事情眞是不湊巧，張先生！我們現在也不好怎樣主張了，儘管東家昨天給我們的電話，已經誰都曉得！」</p>
<p>「唉！」之光說，「誰說不是呢！」</p>
<p>「剛才老板在路上已經把一切都告訴我們了，我們到這時候還用說甚麼話；不過，我們現在先希望能彀盡點力量，把老老板趕緊尋回來。那末事情就好辦了！」</p>
<p>「那末事情就好辦了！」這之光照樣說；接着他又把那篇總賬和對付雍孫事變的方法，仔細說了一番，於是邱代表就說：</p>
<p>「我們這時候，只等兩個俞先生把做事的名單送來，我們再去另外添些工友們，用旁的方法去找。」</p>
<p>到了兩點鐘的時候。除了雍孫始終沒有消息之外，一切都算是弄好了：張羅的欵子來齊了，代替的人也找定了，與警備有關的種種細則，也都分別交給了負責的人去執行了。看來事情已經一步緊似一步。這時候，伯唐和許多人仍然坐在飯堂裏，但是大家的舌子，都像是結住了似的，誰也不能彀掀起甚麼滔滔的議論來；偶爾互相問答了三五句聲，這段對話就不期然而然地立刻結束。空氣是很沈鬱的了，尤其飯堂裏面的陳設，像是格外增加了空氣的沈鬱成分，大家望見她們的質料色采和綫條，都感不到一點兒刺激的意味。倘若沒有過道裏面那一陣陣近乎不斷的電話鈴子，或者叔晋對着話機答話的聲音，也許大家早已快要全體打盹了。有一次，叔晋正對着話機疙𤺥疙𤺥問了好幾回，佩英就想起午前好個「今天晚飯務請必到」的電話：</p>

<h3>靑年心理之大敵</h3>
<p>— 爾礎</p>
<p>提起了中國的靑年，眞會使人痛心疾首，而感到這老大祖國的日趨無望的悲哀！這是無可諱言的，中國靑年的思想的歪曲，以及心理的畸形與矛盾；實在是國家的致命傷。眼看着靑年們成羣的走向墳墓，怎不令人悲痛呢！</p>
<p>爲國家的生存計，爲民族的勃興計，惟有以純正的眼光，淸靜的頭腦，去窺探現代一般靑年的病態；再由病態中尋出病理的癥結，對症下藥，以挽救一般心理迷惘的靑年。而亟謀破除靑年心理上的大敵一層，尤爲重要。</p>
<p>中國靑年們心理上的大敵，實在繁不勝舉，其大者，約如下列數項：</p>
<p>㈠盲從靑年們輒受環境的桎梏而入於歧途，這確是靑年們意志薄弱思想單純的表徵，其結果；乃受社會制度的枰擊，陷於沒落的途徑。這種事實的展露，歸根結底，還是「盲從」應有的結果，譬如：有大部份的靑年，他們並不了解中國目前積弱不振的原因；一味的妄信社會主義，附和共產黨，到處破壞，搗亂，阻碍了國家前途的發展，擾亂了社會的秩序，非但不能救祖國，反使强隣乘隙而入，這便是盲從的鐵證。</p>
<p>㈡誇大狂沒有異議，中國的靑年是害了極度的誇大狂了。言行不符，便是第一個證據。往往幹一件事，事前極盡宣傳之能事，說得天花亂墜，聲勢浩大。那知過後，竟會音信杳然，毫無表示。例如：一種什麼會，什麼團，往往因此而鬧出亂子，致减少了一般自命爲年高碩望者的信仰。而且這種「誇大狂」，實爲將來事業發展之一大阻礙。</p>
<p>㈢好摹倣洋化了的中國靑年，一切惟「洋」足以自豪，他們以爲摹倣洋人是最摩登的事。不錯，摹倣並不能算一件壞事。大和民族的國民，不是以摹倣著稱於世麼？但他們的摹倣，完全是擇其精而去其滓，再下一番苦心，更加以自己的創造。但中斬一般靑年，非但不擇其有益自身者摹倣那些旣無益於國，復有於于已的事。例如：窮奢極侈·爭奇鬥艷，什麼狿舞塲啊！買狗票啊！等等眞是言之痛心！</p>
<p>㈣缺乏創造力中國靑年之沒有創造力，是誰也不能否認的。而他們對於破壞工作的積極努力，倒是値得我讚揚的（？）但是需知，陳舊的，落伍的，破壞之後，是亟待新的建設的，旣沒有破壞後的建設，那這種破壞，祗可認爲是一種妄舉，一種無理暴動，其結果則影響社會的安寗，促進國運的日替，其爲害之程度，豈淺鮮哉！</p>
<p>綜上四項的心理大敵，已夠使中國陷於不拔之深淵了。何况較比數項更甚者尙夥，那得不使中國大傷元氣。</p>
<p>處於這動盪的大時代下的中國，靑年對現實的一切，應該具有深切的了解，尤其要認淸目前中國的危機所在；切不要一味的盲從行事。靑年們！不是我們麻木的時候了。過去的「誇大狂」，「善効顰」，「乏創造力」：：：是我們心理的大敵，也就換救埀危祖國的大敵。我們應該奮力革除惡習，從今日起做一個負起重大使命的靑年，踏着先烈的血跡，去索還我們中國靑年的，也就是中國全同胞的中國失去的領土。</p>
<p>記着吧！親愛的靑年！</p>
<p>最後，我覺得我對於本問題，並無具體的救濟方法貢獻，僅僅把靑年的心理病態，約略的寫下數項。不過，這是我憂傷之餘的呼喊！希望能從我的呼喊，而引起了多方面的注意，討論出一個靑年心理建設的根本辦法；給靑年們一個救命圈，也可藉此而使中國漸趨有望。這便是我的希望了！</p>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3>遺債的處理</h3>
<p>編輯先生；</p>
<p>我對於貴報店員通訊，很是佩服。今有一不易解决之事，屢欲請敎代爲解决，但又恐怕字不成字，句不成句，終於不敢嘗試。現在這事情急待解决，所以不顧一切，寫了這封信，萬望先生代我解决一下。</p>
<p>我弟兄二人，我是烟紙店內一個職員，我弟是做工的。因爲經濟關係，且母親望孫心切，故我弟先我而娶。家內因父親在日，營業失敗，負債累累。今春我與弟在家，經族長派定，家內母親與弟媳妹妹三人生活費，歸我每月寄回；各債欵歸我弟每月寄洋十元，逐漸拔還。不料前月我弟忽將妻帶申居住，今且藉口生活浩大，將十元之數減少，以致各債不夠分派。我屢次勸伊將妻送回，以省開支，但忠言逆耳；且母親養子防老，今見此情形，氣悶成疾。我因所得工資有限，除每月寄家生活費外，又無餘資補助伊之不足，此事實使我進退維谷！現今務請先生代我想一解决之法，幸甚感甚。馬繼良謹起</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>編者按：成年的兄弟，尤其是已婚的兄弟，同在共炊，雖不能說他是一件壞事情，但是絕對絲毫不能勉强。萬一彼此之間，或任何一方面，已經起了憎惡這制度的動機，就無法可以把他們再合在一起了。令弟已經有了這種舉動，想再勸他像以前一樣的回來合居，是辦不到的了；即使勉强做到，因爲胸有芥蒂，一定會鬧出許多閑氣的。所以據我們的意思，你似乎應該將這一層希望放棄，而進行與令弟措商，如何料理遺債。</p>
<p>據你來信的口氣，你似乎要令弟仍舊按月寄十元轉來了債；這一層不免又多少有點說不過去，你想，他的妻子旣經赴申另住，他的責任自然也要量爲輕減。但是令弟的意見，要想籍口在申開支浩繁，而不寄這筆錢，也是錯誤的：我們知道，在上海組織一個小家庭，每月用二三十元，是很平凡的，難道他可以呌你倒貼嗎？那末究屬怎樣好呢？</p>
<p>這裏我們很精密的替你算出了一個數目：在沒有算的以前，我們先要承認三件事實。第一，以前族長公斷的辦法，旣經雙方同意，就作爲是很公平的解决。第二，令堂與令妹的生活費以及遺債的責任，賢昆仲平均負担。第三，令堂令妹與你的弟媳三人，生活費的數量，假定是不相上下的。萬一我們承認了這三點，現在你令弟究應每月寄家多少錢回來，就不難推算了。以前令弟每月寄回的十元內五元是他了理遺債的，其餘的五元，是他支付令堂與令妹兩人中的一人，以及他妻子的生活費。這樣可以知道每一個人的生活費是兩元五角，而現在令弟每月所應當拿出來的，當然是還債的五元以及令堂與令妹兩人中一人的生活費二元五角，合計之爲七元</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>五角。你假使能夠也按月寄七元半回去，不是有了十五元一月嗎？以五元充生活費以外（當然她們原要像以前一樣做做吃吃的）不是仍舊有十塊錢一月可以理債了嗎？你何不請了族長，向令弟這樣說說看呢！</p>

<h3>紅綠燈下（五一）</h3>
<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>（二十七）這是中國翻身的徵候</p>
<p>石喬，這久已沉悶得起銹了的靈魂，今晚重新放射了光芒，他心花怒放地脚不停步。這日子全改變過來了，中國翻身了，上海是中國的上海，這裏的羣衆全不怕巡捕的干涉，如果那些勿鼻子敢有什麼一言半語，準會把捕房，領事館都給燒掉的，可看看我大中華民族的羣衆力量呀！石喬心裏覺得好不痛快！他完全恢復了靑年氣慨，高邁地闊步前進。忽然一個外國人，走過來也被激動得莫名所以地握住他的手，不斷的搖，口裏說着不純熟的中國話：「貴國的好民氣呀，趕快造飛機呀，單拚性命是不行呀！××人那裏是貴國的敵手！努力呀，我親愛的朋友！」說着又去握另外一位中國人的手，好像灌飽了啤酒似的，石喬心裏點着首：「是的，趕快造飛機，造炸彈，把那島國炸沉海底罷。」他不覺間已到了八仙橋，那裏的爆聲更鎭天價嚮，賣號外的小孩子今晚利巿三倍，幾十種小報大報的號外，大大地標印着石川陣亡及瀏河收復八個大字。這種熱鬧情形一直延長到半晚，毫不稍疲。石喬一直走到北四川路底，越走越興奮，當他回到屋裏的時候！是的今晚他毫不猶豫地回到自己的那亭子間了。立哈諾夫和美子都還沒有睡，還在守視着沒有息下去的熱鬧。立哈諾夫今晚第一個握住石喬的手，伸出一隻左手，擎出一隻大母指，直對石喬讚美起來。立哈諾夫冷寞的心扉裏也好像也給灌進了熱力，這實在是不容易的。美子一晚出了立哈諾夫的監視，簡直以暴風雨似的情感，猛烈地抱住石喬搖擺着，熱吻着，石喬自從離開美子，也着實痛苦地浪走了好幾天，一旦被美子抱住，說不出的安</p>
<p>慰與感激，他第一次大膽地也攔腰緊摟她長吻之後，石喬偷將一隻手移進來，一把抓住美子的乳房，美子嗤笑一聲　脫開來，呌道：</p>
<p>「咬死你！」</p>
<p>互相證視了一回，又笑了。良久，她坐在他的身上了，問道：</p>
<p>「你這幾天那裏去了。石川死了眞痛快呀，這殺人精！」</p>
<p>「他是你們的大將軍呀！」石喬打趣她。</p>
<p>「你又瞎說了！」接着道：「我能看見你們翻身，我總覺得快活，不知何故，我更歡喜你也好好地努力起來呀！」</p>

<h3>關於露光電影法的發明</h3>
<p>— 高明</p>
<p>閱七月三十一日本刊，得悉有位廣東韶州人黃道恒發明了一種露光電影法。正在呈請實業部予以專利；不禁萬分地對自己悔恨起來。倘若眞有命數的話，那末自己一定是注定就世貧窮的了。因爲我雖然沒有從事電影業十有餘年，我却在四五年前早就「發明」了這「一種露天電影法」。因爲注定是窮命，所以「發明」之後，終于未敢像黃道恒先生那樣堂皇地向實部請求專利。不然，有了</p>
<p>這四五年，我的腹部也可以相當地肥滿起來。唉！</p>
<p>原來我的「發明」是在日本留學時代一同學來的；更詳細地說來，是從日本東京神田劇塲。也許有人會說我這句話不通，甚至對我的「發明」本身都感得疑惑。但是，親愛的讀者，你們要知道，很顯明的，他們的同樣的設計呌做「耐光映畫」，而我的却呌做「一種露光電影法」啊！</p>
<p>現在我要講到我的「一種露光電影法」的搆造了。因爲我旣未向實部請得專利，那末轉而博得親愛的讀者的理解，或者對我的「發明」給與僅有的一些安慰的。</p>
<p>照我的「發明」，放映室并不像一般影劇院般地安設在銀幕之前觀衆座位之後，却是藏在銀幕背後的。放映室安設在銀幕背後的一側，放映出來的光畫則由鏡子轉射至銀幕。至于銀幕，則普通的銀幕就可以：只要在它的表面（面觀衆的這面）多加一層稀薄的黑紗就行了。是的，就行了。</p>
<p>親愛的讀者也許會絕對不敢相信地問我吧：「這就是你的「發明」的全部了嗎？」是的，親愛的讀者，是的，這就是我的「發明」的全部了。哦，相信我吧，我是不撒謊的。</p>
<p>關於我的「一種露光電影法」的特殊功效，正和黃道恒先生的「一種露光電影法」完全相同，可以任令觀衆座位露光，無須完全黑暗，亦可將窗戶打開，使空氣流通。反顧日本的「耐光映畫」尙祗足以維持風化，可見我的「發明」比他們矮子的要深刻多了。</p>
<p>本人的失敗，雖然出于命數，我却願十足熱誠地預祝我們的黃道恒先生的「發明」未來的成功。我并且希望他在不久的將來，能做出更驚人的「發明」！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「男女之戰」Man　Against　Woman</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>哥倫比亞出品丨卡爾登開映</p>
<p>在哥倫比亞的出品中，這一作品總算是還可以使人相當滿意的。然而這只是就演出方面而言，最明顯的是導演對於演員支配得當。譬如說賈克霍特因着他魁梧的身材，英偉的氣槪，我們不久以前在「辣手懲淫」裏曾經承認他有着相當的成績。而在這裏飾一個孔武有力而且沉着剛毅的偵探，又顯然的有着相當的成功。女角李蘭瑪絲雖然沒有多大變化，可是因爲肯賣力，所以也盡了他的責任，嘉文哥德固然比在「黃金潮」裏面更好一些，即維爾特康羅諾亦以不誇張的技藝而使人滿意。</p>
<p>這就是說，有了這些演員，那末在表演方面是還可以看看的，這固然是先有導演對於每個劇中人都有精細的把握，同時，演員能夠抓住劇中人的個性，於是使這一影片在形式上仍有不少成績。特別是那嘉文哥德飾一意志薄弱而遇事慌張的靑年，眞可以說是維妙維肖。</p>
<p>除了在這一方面以外，我們還可看出導演對於個別的畫面之處理或編輯方面也是很考究的。譬如當偵探最後克服情敵的時候，同時配合着情人哀怨而感人的歌聲，惡黨被擒時而以武裝衛護，以及歌女開脫未婚夫的幾個塲面，都是很經濟而巧妙的方法。但是也有不當之處，如偵探擒黑人强盜的時候，那種冒險的奪手槍，很爲巧妙，但當那盜欵的靑年已經存心殺害偵探，反而爲偵探以擒黑人同樣的方法奪其手槍，到底是十分勉强的。他如對於鏡頭的處理，雖然全是舊方法的運用，然而亦很靈滑而不惡俗。</p>
<p>現在要說到故事方面了。</p>
<p>這大槪是有一定之公式的，特別是在美國電影製作家，差不多總在同一的形式之下製作這種影片。編劇者决定要創造一個超人的英雄，不僅是這一人智力過人，而且要行爲正大而盡忠報國，於是便以奸人盜黨而配襯出英雄的偉大。而且英雄必須要有美人相配，所以英雄在肅淸奸盜之餘，必然的得着美人的埀靑。這一公式，在范明克，湯密斯諸人身上運用過無數次，而賈克霍特旣然有了這一特長，於是又爲編劇者使他在這一公式中大顯身手了。</p>
<p>如上述，本片的故事，簡直沒有在這裏叙述的必要，我們差不多可以想像得出來。其和別的同一內容之作品的不同之處，充其量，不過是名字的不同，或是情節的稍異。然而這一影片在結尾處更爲幼稚，使英雄美人在警長的撮合之下訂婚，幾乎使人忍笑不住，所以這一影片在故事方面是毫無可取的。</p>
<h3>「懸崖」評“Sunset　Pass”新光丨大華</h3>
<p>— 靡蕪</p>
<p>無疑的，「懸崖」又是一張新的兒女英雄的片子。一個畜牧公會的委員，賈克羅克運用着最大的胆量，和努力，破獲了偷牛盜的秘密，救了牧塲主，而和牧場主的假妹珍茵結婚。我們知道武俠故事的起源，完全是被壓逼者無法反抗，而創造出一個故事來聊以自慰的。但是因爲封建的，旣成的法律和道德觀念的限制，使他們不能澈底的反抗，而終於使創造出來的人物也不得不屈服在他們所謂「正誼」與「秩序」之下。賈克羅克就是這樣的一個人。其它則對已經發了財的牧塲主，雖則一望而知過去他也是盜黨，而終於「將一切文件盡行焚毀，以免珍茵洞悉自己之秘密。」這樣，「懸崖」製作者的中心意識，便不難明白了。</p>
<p>本來一張影片所宣洩作者的意識，是絕對無法掩飾的，而「懸崖」是更明顯罷了。</p>
<p>至於技術方面，第一點値得說的就是普通武俠影片常常在故事的開展中，故作疑陣。直到後來，纔逐漸的明顯起來；到最後，就眞相大白。而這一部「懸崖」，却恰恰相反，開始是很明白的，後來穿插一多，疑陣就來，好像賈克羅克的冒充柯林斯，而罕斯比又自承柯林斯，已經呌人目迷神眩。最後更把一切文件焚毀，來結束，本片的故事，則畜牧塲主的秘密，更無從揭曉。這自然是製作者的意識。（爲場主諱）所决定的！</p>
<p>此外則「懸崖」是完全注意武功的影片，所以導演者特別注意於戰鬥的場面，而全片中戰鬥的場面也特別多。中間怒馬奔馳，槍聲身影，著實驚心動魄。尤其是晚上一場，更顯得殺氣凜然。全片淡入淡出的鏡頭，都運用適當，絕不像中國片的錯亂運用。</p>
<p>表演方面男主角是極努力的，他差不多比劇中所需要的更賣力。因此似乎有此過火。女主角則太不夠。然而也許做戲的地方太少之故。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>評「母性之光」</h3>
<p>— 娥</p>
<p>在婦女問題，已經成爲重大的社會問題的現在，這張影片「母性之光」的確是有牠的特殊價値，而使牠在社會上發出偉大的新母性的光輝來！</p>
<p>千年來婦女們爲着「家庭勞動」所束縛，在數重壓迫之下殘喘一生，過去一切的婦女運動，實際上對於婦女，是沒有益處的。特別對於下層勞苦婦女大衆們不但沒能解放了他們，反而使他們列黑暗起來，可是在蘇聯自革命成功後，一方面在法律上把婦女的政治和經濟的地位提高，另方面努力於託兒所和公共食堂工作，這些公共機關普遍的建設。使每一個婦女眞正的能夠完全從「家庭勞動」裏解放出來。然後婦女們纔從物質上精神上完全得到了解放。所以「母性之光」的重心，能夠把眼光注意到「託兒所」去，這的確是有牠新的義意的。</p>
<p>影片的演出空氣很充足，除了開礦空氣，因爲事實上的困難，比較來夠外，其餘絕對沒有忽冷忽熱的「寒熱病」狀態，而使觀衆的注意力，始終離不開影片。此外音樂大廳佈景的宏麗，在中國影片裏，很少見到，鏡頭也有些値得讚美的如家瑚（金𦦨）和慧英（黎灼灼）的外景，并肩從遠而近的鏡頭，那樣漸漸的高起來的攝法，很顯得美麗快感，此外也有些很好的角度。</p>
<p>因爲故事的大部分，偏重在「慈母之光」「良母之淚」的中心上，結果就把這個影片弄成了一幕「人情的感傷」劇。而忽略了新母性的偉大的光輝。因此給觀衆的印象，在後面「託兒所」的幾塲表現，也可以說是「母性之光」的主要點。并不能夠奪回觀衆對於前面大段賢妻良母的深刻印像來。并且這種貧民託兒的空氣，好像不大有貧苦的氣象。我想這些地方有不少的缺憾。</p>
<p>除此之外，關於字幕方面，也還有點問題。我們知道，影片中的字幕，除了說明畫片之外，主要的差不多是對白，這種對白像話劇一樣，是代表劇中人的性格和身分的，絕對不是做文章。否則便會形成對白和劇中人不一致的現象。現在我們把這張影片的字幕不妥的地方提出來。</p>
<p>「林太太請坐」當慧英去訪她前夫家瑚的時候，家瑚這樣說。這種口氣至少都會把一冷靜的革命家，表現得「酸溜溜」的了，所以我覺得不妥當，應當仍喊她一聲「慧英」</p>
<p>「我病好了以後，我們回到上海去，開始我們自然的生活」小梅對她母親說：：：：「只這一點點的收獲，已經抵得所損失的一切了。」小梅說她的女兒：：：：：世界經濟恐慌的潮流（或者字面不一樣，我記不淸楚）語氣是這樣的，已經影響到了南洋。家瑚對寄梅說：：：：這些字幕，無論他是不是「日常用語」或是正確不正確，先不去管他，第一就使觀衆耳朶生澀澀」的覺得不像是畫片中人，口裡自然講出似的。所以這雖是小問題，如果能把牠弄得更切當一點，對於影片効果的帮助，也不少了。</p>

<p>薛立丹聽見了嚇了一跳，他囁嚅著道：「我現在正在翻譯。我曉得那種戲你是不在乎的。」</p>
<p>「在乎不在乎，我自己寂奪好丁。脚本拿來給我看。」這是麗妲駁斥薛立丹的話。</p>
<p>薛立丹告訴她脚本祗有一本，現在在他的公事房裏；但是麗妲華儂說「不要緊，我上你公事房裏去看好了。」他迫著薛立丹到他的公事房裏去了。意士頓等到薛立丹和麗妲華儂走了，歎了一口氣說道：「或者她連看都看不懂。不過，海傑斯還在外面等著呢。意士頓給麗妲」</p>

<h3>Song Requests the Central Government to Dispatch Senior Officials to Handle Affairs</h3>
<p>Also Requests Pang to be Appointed Chairman of Chahar</p>
<p>Jiang Bocheng Departs from Beiping to Xuanhua</p>
<p>Song Awaits Jiang's Arrival to Proceed to Zhangjiakou Together</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun conferred in Xuanhua on the evening of the 10th regarding defense matters. They are awaiting Jiang Bocheng's arrival before proceeding together to Zhangjiakou to meet with Feng [Yuxiang] to discuss post-incident arrangements. Jiang departed from Beiping on the morning of the 11th. Feng's headquarters will be dissolved within days, and military and administrative powers will be completely handed over. After meeting with Song, he will depart from Zhangjiakou for elsewhere. Regarding the telegrams from Jiang [Jieshi] and Wang [Jingwei] requesting him to go to the capital, he replied stating that the government has a comprehensive plan for resisting Japan, and he can be anywhere. Song is unwilling to take responsibility for the post-incident arrangements in Chahar and has requested the central government to dispatch senior officials to handle the matter. On the 9th, he telegraphed the central government, requesting Pang to be appointed Chairman of Chahar. Fang Zhenwu has already accompanied the troops to Wanquan. Regarding the post-incident arrangements for the various armies, the Military Council has decided to reorganize the three divisions of Deng Wen, Li Zhongyi, and Zhang Renjie. The fate of the remaining ten thousand plus men will be decided based on the circumstances. (CNA dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang Bingxun arrived in Xuanhua yesterday afternoon, and the military headquarters also moved defenses along with him, establishing itself inside Xuanhua city. Song and Pang met in the evening to discuss the post-incident arrangements in Chahar. Song intends to request Pang to continue serving as Chairman of Chahar after taking over the military and administrative affairs of Chahar province. He telegraphed Jiang on the 9th, requesting him to forward a formal appointment from the central government. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan was originally scheduled to advance into Zhangjiakou yesterday, but for ease of coordination, he specially telegraphed Jiang Bocheng, requesting him to proceed to Xuanhua. Song is still in Xuanhua, awaiting Jiang's arrival to travel together. Jiang left Beiping this afternoon. Speaking to reporters at the station, he said that Song and Pang are both in Xuanhua, awaiting his arrival before proceeding together to Zhangjiakou to meet with Feng. Currently, Zhang Muta and Fang Zhenwu have already left Zhangjiakou with the troops. Regarding the post-incident arrangements for the Chahar situation, a decision has been made to handle matters in accordance with the previous plan proposed by the Military Council. The reorganization of the divisions of Ji [Hongchang] and others, as well as the internal organization of the Chahar provincial government, must await Song's arrival in Zhangjiakou and takeover before they can be initiated. It is heard that Feng is still in Xincun, Zhangjiakou. He will leave after meeting with Song and others. Jiang Bocheng will arrive in Xuanhua tonight and plans to travel to Zhangjiakou with Song and others that same night. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying recently represented Song Zheyuan in going to Lushan to meet with Jiang, where he made some reports. He returned to Beiping this afternoon and is scheduled to meet with He [Yingqin] this afternoon. He will go to Xuanhua tonight to report back to Song. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The old troops of Chahar province have all been transferred to the Zhangbei area, and Song will be responsible for handling them in the future. As for the reorganization of the various armies, preliminary regulations were made at Shacheng. This time, the process will continue according to the established plan. Because they have left Zhangjiakou and are moving towards Longguan and Chicheng, Fang Zhenwu has also accompanied the troops. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang's secretary, Lei Jishang, has returned to Zhangjiakou today upon receiving a telegram summoning him for consultation. It is hoped here that Feng will reside in an ancient temple between Xuanhua and Shacheng, where Song will send troops to protect him, as this would be more appropriate. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Suggestions for resolving the Chahar situation, submitted to Lushan, are as follows: 1. Request Feng to end the name and organization of the Allied Army; 2. Request Feng to leave Chahar for Beijing immediately to jointly plan major affairs, or, failing that, the central government will give him a title and send him abroad for recuperation; 3. After the Allied Army is disbanded, the remaining troops will be reorganized into three regular border defense armies, with Fang Zhenwu, Sun Liangcheng, and Ji Hongchang serving as army commanders respectively, stationed in the Zhangbei area, so that Feng's strength will still exist. It is still difficult to predict whether Jiang and Wang will agree, and whether the local area has the capacity to provide for them. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Flies to Guling</h3>
<p>Jiang Dispatches Own Plane to Beijing to Await Pickup</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei, in response to Jiang's invitation, flew to Xun at 10:43 a.m. on the 11th in a Sikorsky plane dispatched by Jiang, accompanied by Tie Ceng and Zeng Zhongming, and then transferred to Lushan. Before departing, Wang said that on July 31, when he was in Lushan, Jiang had informed him that Mr. Huang Yingbai would arrive in Lushan from Beiping on the 6th, requesting him to stay on the mountain for a few days to jointly discuss the various post-incident issues in North China. At that time, Wang returned to Beijing on the 1st because Huang's arrival in Lushan was still a week away and important matters in Beijing urgently needed to be dealt with. Yesterday, he received a telegram from Jiang inviting him to Lushan and dispatching a plane to pick him up, hence today's trip. The purpose of this trip is to discuss political, military, and financial issues in North China with Jiang. He plans to stay in Lushan for two days and is scheduled to return to Beijing next Monday. The Executive Yuan meeting next week will still be held as usual. As for the Chahar incident, although Feng has issued a telegram declaring the surrender of military and administrative powers, he has not yet abolished the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Army. Song Zheyuan has already arrived in Xuanhua and has sent a telegram to Beijing. Whether he has arrived in Zhangjiakou is still unknown to me. It is confirmed that Japanese and puppet troops have thrown grenades in Guyuan and are attempting to attack Duolun. However, the true situation has not yet been reported. The future of the Chahar situation is difficult to be optimistic about. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang flew to Guling at 10 a.m. on the 11th in a Sikorsky plane. Before departing, he made the following statement to a CNA reporter: On July 31, when I departed from Guling to return to Beijing, I received a telegram from Huang Yingbai stating that he would arrive in Guling on August 6, requesting me to wait for a few days to discuss matters with Jiang. As I had been away from Beijing for a week and many routine official matters had accumulated, I replied by telegram that I would return to Beijing first, and if necessary, I would come to Guling for discussion. On the 9th, I received a telegram from Jiang urging me to come and dispatched his personal Sikorsky plane to pick me up. The plane arrived in Beijing on the afternoon of the 10th. I will return to Beijing in about two or three days on this trip. (CNA dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Secretaries Zeng Zhongming and Cao Lin, as well as an aide-de-camp, accompanied President Wang to Guling. Lin proposed that Lu Chao be dispatched to see him off. Chu Minyi and Peng Xuepei took care of matters at the station. Wang is scheduled to return to Beijing next Monday, and the Executive Yuan meeting next week will be held as scheduled. (CNA dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Frontier Political System to be Studied by Groups</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Frontier Political and Educational System Research Association, organized by the Examination Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the General Staff Headquarters, and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, will be divided into eleven groups: national defense, foreign affairs, politics, economy, transportation, conferment of titles, culture, society, justice, Buddhism, and Islam. Each group will have two or three people responsible for research. Recently, the national defense and foreign affairs issues of Tibet have become the most important events in current frontier affairs, but it has been decided that they are not of a local nature and should be handled by the central government with full authority.

Guan Enlin, the magistrate of Zunhua County, led a team of public security, more than one hundred and thirty people, arrived in Tangshan by train at noon. Zhu Yi, sent by the War Zone Receiving Committee, came along. They will go to Zunhua together early on the 12th to take over. The journey is one hundred and fifty miles, and the road is muddy after the rain. It will take until the 13th to arrive. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tangshan) It has been decided that the Beining Pingyu Railway through traffic will be implemented on the 13th, starting with one express train and one slow train each.

A train will be sent from Tangshan early on the 12th to distribute necessary supplies to the stations, and the empty train will remain in Yushuguan to prepare for selling tickets and running trains from Yushuguan on the 13th. Another train will be sent later to handle takeover matters. A work train departed on the 11th to inspect and repair the telecommunications along the line and arrived in Yushuguan at noon on the 11th. It will return early on the 12th. Another train departed from Tangshan on the morning of the 11th to inspect and repair the road gates, arriving in Changli in the evening. The last passenger train of the Fengshan Railway is scheduled to return to Yushuguan at 7 p.m. on the 12th. A portion of the important staff and various documents and items will be transferred back to Yushuguan with the train. Most of the old staff of the Beining Railway will continue to serve as usual. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The takeover of the counties east of the Luan River is about to be completed.

<p>(Beiping) After the end of the takeover of the war zone, Qian'an was taken over on the 11th. No report has been received from Zunhua, but there should be no problems. The work of organizing the administration and training the puppet troops in the pacified areas is currently being planned. Administrative inspectors are being established in the east of Luan River and north of Beiping to be responsible for handling affairs, and it has been decided that Tao Shangming and Yin Rugeng will be appointed to these positions and will be announced today. The Luan River east region will govern nine counties, including Lulong, with the office located in Tangshan. The Beiping north region will govern thirteen counties, including Ji County, with the office located in Miyun. Tao and Yin will begin organizing after receiving their commissions.

<p>Southbound Trains on the Pinghan Railway Stop at Xinxiang</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Crosses the Yellow River Railway Bridge on Foot</p>
<h3>Yesterday the Water Receded Gradually</h3>
<p>(Kaifeng) The river water in She County rose sharply by 5.5 meters from the 7th to the 9th, breaking the highest new record in more than twenty years. The water level in the Qin River also rose sharply. The embankments of the 6th, 7th, and 8th forts in Si County burst, and the water overflowed for about ten li, turning dozens of square miles outside the long dike into marshlands. The River Affairs Bureau is making every effort to reinforce the dikes, but it has not been resolved as of the morning of the 10th. The water situation at Heigangkou, which is located several li from Bianzhou, is also dangerous, and the situation is very tense. (CNA dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Sixty-eight holes of the Yellow River Bridge were washed away by the water, and traffic was cut off for two days. The Pinghan Railway Bureau dispatched Wang Jinzhi, the chief of the engineering department, to Zhengzhou on the 11th to investigate and supervise the repairs and announced that tickets for northbound passenger trains would only be sold to Zhengzhou for the time being. Furthermore, the bureau received a telegram from Zhengzhou on the evening of the 11th stating that the river water was gradually receding and it was hoped that the entire line would be open to traffic on the 12th. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou) Yu Xuezhong arrived on the north bank of the Yellow River from Beiping on the morning of the 11th. Due to the rising Yellow River water, the special train stopped. He then crossed the railway bridge on foot and boarded a special train prepared for him by the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau on the south bank of the Yellow River. Yu passed through Zhengzhou at 3 p.m. to go to Hankou and then transferred to Lushan to meet with Jiang. Yu said that Feng has left Zhangjiakou and arrived in Zhangbei with a small number of troops, and it is heard that he is still heading west. All the counties east of the Luan River have been taken over. He was summoned to Lushan this time and will return to Tianjin in about a week. (CNA dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) In addition to one hole in the Yellow River railway bridge being washed away, the railway track in Zhan Dian on the north bank was also washed away. Yu Xuezhong hired a civilian boat at that location on the 11th to cross the river, rode a handcar to Zhengzhou, and changed to a special train to go south. He is scheduled to arrive in Hankou on the morning of the 12th. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Yu Xuezhong passed through Baoding southbound at 11:25 a.m. on the 10th. Due to the sharp rise in river water, the special train returned to Beiping on the north bank of the Yellow River and will reschedule the southbound trip, or possibly change to the Jinpu Railway and transfer by boat to Jiangxi. (CNA dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Traffic on the Pinghan Railway was disrupted due to the sudden rise in the Yellow River water and flooding on both banks, disrupting traffic on the evening of the 10th. The Pinghan office received a telegram from Zhengzhou on the 11th stating that the river water was still rising and falling intermittently, and the water situation in Zhan Dian, south of Xinxiang, was quite serious. The railway track was washed away, and the villagers also demolished several sections of sleepers and dug them up to protect themselves. Only one pier of the Yellow River Bridge was submerged. The railway bureau has dispatched workers to repair it urgently. Passenger and freight trains to and from the 11th were not able to pass. Yu Xuezhong's special train temporarily stopped in Xinxiang on the evening of the 10th, then transferred to a handcar to cross the river and immediately headed south, and should arrive in Hankou on the evening of the 11th. (CNA dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou) At 12 p.m. on the 9th, the Yellow River water rose sharply by more than eight feet, level with the Pinghan railway bridge. All the power lines were submerged and the water is still rising. The water situation on the railway is extremely serious. Villagers demolished more than a zhang of the roadbed to allow the water to flow eastward. The Nanyang station north of Zhengzhou is eight feet deep in the plains. The first and second express trains of the Pinghan line, as well as the 11th and 12th trains, were all diverted to the north and south banks of Henan. North-south traffic has been cut off. Yu Xuezhong was also unable to cross the river due to the excessive rise of the water and returned to Beiping. Si County was inundated by water overflowing from the riverbed, with the entire county turned into a vast expanse of water. Thousands of victims were drowned, dozens of sailboats were sunk due to the high waves, and all the refugees were drowned. The four suburbs of Si County have become marshlands, the city gates are closed, and residents are waiting for help. (CNA dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The railway track between Pinghan Railway's Zhan Dian was washed away by the Yellow River water. Currently, the northern section can only run from Pinghan Railway to Xinxiang. Yu Xuezhong's special train returned to Ding County due to the road being cut off and is expected to arrive in Pinghan Railway tonight. It is heard that Yu may take the Jinpu Railway to go south. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telephone call from the West Station on the 11th stated that southbound trains on the Pinghan Railway can only run to Xinxiang for the time being because the road was damaged in the Zhan Dian area of Hebei. (CNA dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Yellow River is causing trouble again. According to news from Kaifeng, the water level there is the highest it has been in ten years. The water has overflowed the embankments in Wenzhou and other places, and the area of farmland submerged is quite large. There have been several levee breaches, several miles long, near Changyuan Mengjin and Wanxian, resulting in heavy losses. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Yu Xuezhong's southbound special train was blocked on the north bank due to the Yellow River bridge being broken. He will cross the river by boat. The Zhengzhou station has dispatched a car to the south bank to meet him. He is scheduled to arrive in Hankou on the 11th and transfer to Xun. Zhang Qun will return to Hubei after meeting with Yu. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Zhang Lianjia returned to Jinan and said that the dangerous construction site of Li Shengtun in the upper reaches of the Yellow River has been reinforced. The breach in Changyuan has a small amount of water flowing over the embankment. Even if it reaches Shandong, only the river set will be slightly affected. However, the river water is too large, and the civil embankments in the upper and middle reaches have all seen water. If it rises again, it will be tight. Today, all three reaches are slightly rising. The water level in Luokou is 29.65 meters. It is rumored that the river water in Shaanzhou has risen sharply, with a water level of 297.06 meters, which is the highest water level in years. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) On the evening of the 10th, the Yellow River water overflowed between Zhengzhou and Heigangkou, collapsing more than a dozen places and disrupting transportation. The people of Bian were agitated. In addition to the River Affairs Bureau supervising the people to do their best to protect the dikes, Liu Zhi also urgently dispatched 900 soldiers to rescue the situation. On the morning of the 11th, party, government, and military officials and reporters went to inspect the river and supervise the rescue efforts. From midnight, the upper and middle reaches have receded. By noon, Heigangkou had fallen more than three feet, and the river was sloping northward. Zhengzhou rose to 87 meters yesterday and fell to 84 meters today. The piers of the Yellow River Bridge in the 7th and 8th holes were washed and shifted two inches eastward. The railway line between Zhan Dian and the north bank was dug by farmers in eight places. The houses were either submerged or collapsed. The railway workers boarded the train to work. The Shaanzhou River water also fell six feet at six o'clock on the morning of the 11th. However, the Languo River overflowed and flowed eastward from the old course of the Yellow River north of the city. The water level was almost level with the embankment, which was very dangerous for the city. The county party committee and the county magistrate telegraphed the local authorities here to request a solution. Liu Zhi went to Si River to supervise the project at five o'clock on the morning of the 11th. The rumor of a breach in the Languo River embankment is inaccurate. (CNA dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Russian-Puppet Border Disputes</h3>
<p>Japanese One-Sided Propaganda</p>
<p>(Harbin) The head of the Japanese military commission in Heihe, across from Hailanpao, issued an article to reporters yesterday stating that Soviet troops had invaded "Manzhouguo" territory near Heihe more than twenty times, sometimes seizing food and sometimes killing residents. He had personally witnessed people fleeing from Russian territory, and regardless of age or gender, all were killed by Russian soldiers with machine guns in the Amur River. Recently, twenty-four refugees who escaped from within the territory said that people in the Amur province were dying of famine and disease along the way, and thousands had been detained in prisons and labor camps.

<h3>Japanese and Puppet Troops Invading Duolun Not Confirmed</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 10th stating that Japanese and puppet troops have invaded Duolun, the investigation shows that this is a rumor fabricated by the Japanese and puppet forces and is completely untrue. We have previously urged the Japanese side to respect the spirit of the armistice agreement and not engage in military actions again, so as to avoid problems. (CNA dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Part of Puppet Army Li Shoushan's Troops Fleeing to Rehe Border</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Zunhua stated that since the signing of the armistice agreement, the farmers in the non-militarized zones of the eastern counties of Ping have organized civilian groups for self-defense to prevent banditry. It happened that the puppet army under Li Shoushan was stationed in several counties including Zunhua, Ji County, and Xinglong, and constantly extorted supplies and looted local merchants and residents. At first, the civilian groups were weak and did not lightly suppress them. On the 20th of last month, the civilian groups of Ji County, Zunhua, Xinglong and other counties jointly drove Shoushan out of the territory. Li's troops, Du Yi and others, resisted stubbornly, but after a joint attack by the civilian groups, they could not hold out and have dispersed to the Pingquan area of Rehe.

<h3>Cuban President Unwilling to Accept Foreign Interference</h3>
<p>Orders All Industries to Resume Work, Violators Will Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>American Ultimatum Expires</p>
<p>Machado Makes No Indication of Resigning</p>
<p>Four Overseas Chinese Die in Cuban Revolution</p>
<p>Havana. Cuban President Machado told reporters today that if foreign countries could stop their conspiracies, his government would easily resolve the disturbances and restore normalcy. He also said that if the Liberal Party wanted him to leave office, he would be happy to step down, but his departure seems to be desired by some foreign officials, and he cannot comply. Furthermore, Cuba is his motherland and home. Whether he steps down or not, he wants to live in Cuba forever and die in Cuba. He also said that he is willing to accept any honorable solution, but cannot recognize the results of American interference. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Havana. Cuban President Machado issued an order tonight requiring all businesses to open for business by Friday morning, violators will be imprisoned for fifty days. At the same time, he issued a notice that he would not hesitate to severely punish striking workers. Machado is now at least temporarily in the lead. Barbers, automobiles, trams, electricity, and vendors have all voted to resume work, because government representatives have questioned union leaders whether they want to be ruled by Cubans or Americans. After this patriotic advice, the aforementioned results were obtained. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(New York) The American president yesterday expressed his attitude towards the Cuban labor and political unrest to the Cuban ambassador and instructed him to convey it to Cuban President Machado. Today, he is waiting for a reply from the Cuban president, but the Cuban embassy in Washington has not yet received any direct telegram from its president. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Havana. The starving, miserable, and newspaper-less capital of Cuba last night heard the government radio broadcast, asking the people to support Cuban President Machado in resisting foreign enemies. The city has about 500,000 people, and almost no food is available now. The poor will starve to death. The government's radio broadcast currently appears to be attempting to stir up anti-American sentiment. Both sides in the local area criticize Washington's leaders. The Liberal Party, to which President Machado belongs, criticizes the American ambassador's mediation, believing that this move hinders Cuban sovereignty. It is expected that the Cuban incident will reach a climax within the next twenty-four hours tonight, because the American ultimatum requiring all opponents of the Machado government to surrender has now expired, and political and economic tensions have reached the point of imminent collapse. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Havana. American President Roosevelt yesterday formally asked Cuban Ambassador to the United States Sinda to persuade Cuban President Machado to resign voluntarily, and informed him that several ships loaded with food would be sent to Cuba to relieve the siege of the country's people. If Cuba is not happy with this, then several American warships will come to visit, because America's international obligations and its responsibility to the civilized world do not allow the American government to sit idly by and watch the chaos of the Cuban political situation and the prolongation of its autocratic politics. Sinda said that Machado is probably taking the current attitude because of face-saving issues. Roosevelt replied that if Machado is willing to resign, it is sacrificing himself to save the country, and the United States will greatly approve of it. Roosevelt also said that if Machado has a counter-proposal, it must be submitted today at the latest. (Havana Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Cuban Liberal Party Refuses American Mediation</h3>
<p>Havana. Cuban Secretary of State Folara issued a propaganda statement after the president announced that President Machado would submit a counter-proposal to the American ambassador's proposal to step down. Afterwards, the leaders of the Liberal Party gathered and decided to reject American mediation. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(New York) According to news received here, if the Liberal Party, which is currently ruling Cuba, wants to reorganize the government, Machado is willing to resign. However, the Liberal Party has been Machado's puppet party for eight years, so observers here mostly believe that even if there is such a move, it may not produce the necessary reforms. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Dilemma</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Cuban situation has placed President Roosevelt in a difficult position. If he orders U.S. Marines to land to protect lives and property, the Latin American countries may jointly condemn American imperialism. However, if a revolution erupts, other countries will seek to protect their people. If that happens, the Monroe Doctrine will be historically undermined. The Japanese ambassador, after inquiring with the State Department today, stated that Secretary of State Hull had informed him that the United States would take all possible measures to prevent the loss of life and property. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>U.S. State Department Seeks Opinions from South America</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department has been discreetly investigating the opinions of South American countries regarding Cuban President Machado. It is generally speculated that if the United States clearly states its views on the Cuban political situation and allows Machado sufficient time to step down on his own, then uses force to intervene, most South American countries would generally approve. According to the U.S. intention, Machado must take the following two steps to satisfy the U.S.: 1. Appoint an impartial foreign minister; 2. Machado resigns himself. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>U.S. Steps Taken: First Apply Economic Pressure</p>
<p>(Washington) It is claimed that the U.S. State Department deeply believes that for Cuba's financial and political recovery, it is absolutely necessary for the current President Machado to leave office. Today, when U.S. Secretary of State Hull, Undersecretary of State Phillips, and Cuban Ambassador Cintas met, they clearly and firmly informed Cintas of the U.S. stance. After the meeting, Cintas announced that he would immediately return to his country. Although he denied having any special mission, it is expected that he will inform Machado that if he refuses to resign, U.S. intervention may be unavoidable. According to one prevailing opinion here, if Machado still refuses to resign, the U.S. may follow up with economic pressure, such as increasing tariffs or implementing import quotas. If this is still ineffective, it will carry out intervention. (National News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>U.S. Warships on Standby</p>
<p>(New York) Although President Roosevelt has stated that he will do his best to avoid U.S. intervention in Cuba, according to well-informed sources here, 1,000 Marines stationed at Quantico, Virginia, are prepared to be transferred to the Cuban capital. 2,000 Marines belonging to the Atlantic Fleet and 5,000 sailors stationed near New York can also be dispatched to Cuba immediately. In addition, three cruisers and two destroyer squadrons can sail to the Cuban capital upon order. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>U.S. Republican Party Favors Diplomatic Pressure</p>
<p>Pittman Believes Monroe Doctrine Still Applicable</p>
<p>(New York) Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress have assured their support for the actions deemed necessary by the U.S. President to resolve the Cuban political crisis. Representative Fish, the Republican leader of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, met with the President today and said that all Republican members will support the President, but stated that he believes there will be no need for military intervention, and that the necessary reforms can be achieved through diplomatic pressure.</p>
<p>Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, went to Washington today to begin a detailed study of the Cuban situation. It is said that he believes the corruption of the Cuban government is the root cause of this turmoil, so he believes that it may not be possible to resolve it without intervention. Even though the Monroe Doctrine is no longer applicable to most issues related to the Western Hemisphere, he believes it can still be invoked for this Cuban situation. Other countries should at least understand the purpose of the United States, and if necessary, it will not hesitate to intervene. Once order is restored, the government will be returned to the Cuban people. He also stated that financial difficulties have made the Cuban political situation even more serious, so he personally advocates reducing import taxes on Cuban goods, and in fact, import taxes on goods from all Latin American countries should be reduced appropriately. (National News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Cuban Ambassador to the U.S. Returns Home After Meeting with Hull</p>
<p>(Washington) As of now, Cuban Ambassador to the U.S. Cintas has not provided Secretary of State Hull with a definitive answer from Machado. Cintas had a lengthy conversation with Hull. According to Cintas himself, the two only discussed economic issues, but according to sources from the State Department, political issues were also a major part of the conversation. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Cuban Ambassador to the U.S. Cintas departed for Cuba tonight to personally convey the situation here to President Machado. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>U.S. Plans to Establish Naval Base on the West Coast of the Pacific</p>
<p>Secret Negotiations with Mexico, Japan Attaches Great Importance</p>
<p>Will Use the Four-Power Treaty to Prevent its Realization</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The news of the U.S. Navy constructing a base in the Gulf of California in Mexico has alarmed all sectors in Japan. The naval authorities especially value its future. The U.S. Navy has recognized the importance of the Gulf since 1908. In that year, the U.S. World Patrol Fleet conducted training there a month before its departure. Similar intelligence was also heard during the Shanghai Incident last year. The U.S. naval exercises last year were training for the Gulf's offensive and defensive operations. The distances from the Gulf to important Pacific bases are as follows: to Panama, 2,430 miles; to Los Angeles, 670 miles; to San Francisco, 1,030 miles; to Honolulu, 4,860 miles. (Japan United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources, the U.S. government and the Mexican government are conducting secret negotiations to establish a large-scale U.S. naval base in Baja California, Mexico. If the U.S. establishes a large-scale base there, it will significantly increase the U.S. Navy's power in Pacific operations. The Japanese naval authorities attach great importance to this. (Dentsu, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The U.S. government has decided to build a naval base on the Pacific coast. This plan is related to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet's move to the Pacific and the recent large-scale shipbuilding plan. It is a manifestation of the U.S. government's aggressive stance in the Pacific. The Japanese authorities will verify whether this plan is actually being implemented. If it violates the Four-Power Treaty on the limitation of Pacific defenses, they will investigate the truth, decide on a policy, lodge a protest, and resolutely prevent its implementation. (Japan United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>End of Japanese Air Defense Drill</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo air defense drill began last night under the moonlight with planes from both the attacking and defending forces engaging in combat. A complete blackout was implemented throughout the city, creating a bleak and dark scene. After one night in the capital, the final drill continued to begin on the morning of the 11th. At 4 a.m., enemy planes appeared and continued to increase their numbers by two or three, attempting to attack and destroy the capital. The protection group here maintained vigilance throughout the night and used smoke screens to block off the entire capital. Earlier, the defending forces had repelled the attacking force's aircraft carrier with submarines. By about 5 a.m., the enemy planes had disappeared from the capital, and by 6 a.m., the alert was lifted in the Kanto area. Thus, the large-scale air defense drill, which cost hundreds of millions of yen and mobilized 400,000 protection group members, was completely concluded. (Japan United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>British Exclusion of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Spreads to Various Colonies</p>
<p>Japan Seeks Countermeasures</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British exclusion of Japanese goods has spread to Australia, the Union of South Africa, and Malta. According to a cable received by a certain agency, the Australian Chamber of Commerce is leading a fierce movement to impose anti-dumping duties on Japanese goods, focusing on rubber shoes, cotton cloth, and electric bulbs. According to a telegram from Acting Consul-General Ota, the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Sydney and Melbourne has launched a movement to prevent the increase in tariffs, and some even advocate not buying wool as a strong countermeasure. The government of the Union of South Africa has recently paid considerable attention to Japan's resolute decision not to buy Indian cotton. Foreign Minister Uchida is scheduled to host a meeting with wool industry magnates at the Foreign Minister's official residence on the 18th to exchange views at a joint government-private sector conference on wool policy.

The Japanese representatives are Ambassador Sawada and representatives from the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Buller and Noyes are both officials of the Indian Governor-General's Executive Council and the Department of Commerce and Industry. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese business representatives for the Anglo-Japanese textile industry conference, Okada, Miyake, Miura, Kawaguchi, Tamagaki, etc., boarded the Japanese ship "Chichibu Maru" today, heading to London via the United States. It is reported that Japanese businessmen are very dissatisfied with the policies of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The British insisted that their agenda must include artificial silk. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs accepted the advice of advisor Kadono and agreed to this. However, Japanese businessmen requested the removal of this item, and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had no choice but to telegraph Ambassador Matsudaira again, requesting the UK to agree to eliminate artificial silk as an agenda item.

<p>White Russian Conspiracy Uncovered</p>
<p>Harbin Establishes Private Spy Agency</p>
<p>Communicating with Japan and the Puppet State</p>
<p>Arrested Criminals to be Tried in Khabarovsk</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian government announced that a White Russian private spy agency in Harbin was established in October 1931 and was quite large in scale. All bandits and acts of terrorism along the Soviet Russian Far Eastern border were directed by this agency. However, it was not discovered by Soviet Russia until Prince Ukhtomsky and nine of his companions were arrested on the Far Eastern border on July 14 of this year. The Khabarovsk authorities reported that those people confessed that they had entered Russian territory on the orders of General Kosmin to engage in private espionage. Kosmin had set up a headquarters in Harbin and was communicating with some Japanese officials in the puppet state. It is expected that all those arrested will be tried in Khabarovsk, but the date has not yet been set. (National News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Khabarovsk Today, it was announced here that Prince Ukhtomsky and nine accomplices, who were imprisoned by the Soviet authorities on June 29, will be convicted of espionage. The preliminary investigation of the case has been completed and will be transferred to the Soviet Far East District Court for trial. The ten White Russians were arrested on the steamer "Tongshan," which was heading upstream on the Ussuri River at the time. When the ship sailed from Harbin, it carried the ten of them disguised as armed guards. They confessed that they were attempting to infiltrate Soviet territory to carry out espionage and ambush operations. Anti-Japanese Chinese soldiers stationed in the Ussuri River area ordered the ship to stop, disarmed the White Russians, arrested them, and extradited them to the Soviet border authorities. It was announced here that, according to the preliminary investigation of the case, the arrested criminals belonged to an anti-Soviet detective organization in Harbin. This organization was in contact with some military authorities in Manchuria. Its establishment occurred after the Japanese occupation of Shenyang, in October 1931. This organization was extremely active in promoting the formation of espionage and ambush groups and bandit gangs on the Soviet border (this work was part of a plan to resist the Soviet Union by armed force).

<p>Commentary: The Aftermath of the Chahar Incident</p>
<p>The Chahar problem, which has been causing disturbances for several months, regarded as a hidden worry by the government and a cause of concern for the people, has recently come to a formal end with the entry of Song Zheyuan into Zhangjiakou and the voluntary retreat of Feng Yuxiang to the north. This unstable Chahar, on the one hand, affects international relations, and on the other hand, shakes North China. Although some difficult issues may inevitably remain to be resolved, if they can be handled seriously and appropriately, the overall situation can be said to be gradually stabilizing. At the beginning of Feng Yuxiang's uprising, the name of resisting Japan was not bad, and the recovery of Dolon was not without courage. However, it is a pity that Chahar Province is small, with a land area of more than 820,000 square miles, but a population of only 2 million. Especially in recent years, after the ravages of war, the Ping-Sui Railway can hardly support its own expenses. Using this small area to resist Japan, no matter how lofty the aspirations or how precise the calculations, there is absolutely no possibility of winning against an international war. Moreover, there are too many contradictions among Feng's subordinates: first, the political orders cannot be unified; second, apart from conscription, there is no relationship with the general public; and third, under these restrictive conditions, there is little assistance from other armies. There is no precedent in the world for a force that is not internally united to be able to fight externally. Recently, Feng has realized that he cannot sustain it for long and has expressed his intention to move to Zhangbei. Will he take this opportunity to retire and focus on his so-called forestry and land reclamation? Or will he continue to recruit troops and horses to plot another uprising? Or will he temporarily retreat to recuperate and wait for an opportunity? This is indeed a matter of Feng's personal choices, and we cannot speculate on his behalf. However, Chahar in the future will face many dangers. Leaving aside the external forces of aggression, the political and military future of the province requires active efforts.</p>
<p>First, Chahar Province is inherently a poor area. The rural economy lacks a solid and reliable foundation. The Inner Mongolia area still lags behind in the pastoral era. Since 1919, the trade route to Outer Mongolia has been blocked, and the income from animal husbandry cannot be used to generate surplus. The Ping-Sui and Bei-Ning Railways not only lack convenient transportation, but also their taxes are three to ten times higher than before 1921. Both Han and Mongol merchants are hesitant to invest, and the general society has no way out. Therefore, the first priority for the aftermath problem today is to quickly find a way out for the people who are in a state of poverty.</p>
<p>Second, Feng's directly affiliated troops are not very numerous, and their disposal may not be very difficult. However, the miscellaneous troops that he has incorporated may not be willing to undergo strict training if they are formally reorganized. If they are allowed to leave on their own, they will either be used as enemy forces or harm the people. This is a matter of great concern. Therefore, how to settle these various types of mixed troops is the responsibility of the military authorities and the responsibility that Song Zheyuan, who has recently gone to Zhangjiakou, should also pay attention to.</p>
<p>Third, whenever our country experiences a period of chaos, all transportation, such as automobiles and trains powered by machinery, as well as handcarts and horse-drawn carts pushed by people and animals, will suffer extreme damage. This situation has been deteriorating since the Cao-Wu coup in 1925. The railways are disorganized, trains run irregularly, and the transportation of goods is almost without legal protection. There is a shortage of livestock such as cattle and horses, making cultivation difficult. At this time, when the military situation has come to an end, it is indeed not easy to achieve immediate results with active measures, but passive transportation can indirectly help the development of the local area and indirectly supplement the administrative facilities. Therefore, organizing railway transportation, returning the vehicles used for military transport, and quickly releasing the conscripted livestock are also urgent matters to be implemented in the aftermath.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points only require the local authorities to have the determination to implement them, the sincerity to serve the country and the people, and to rise up and work hard. It is not difficult to implement them gradually within three months. Today, the greatest difficulty in the Chahar area is the Japanese warlords who command puppet troops and provide them with supplies and equipment to invade various border areas of Chahar Province. If they are lucky enough to win, they will gradually encroach on the territory, from Dolon to Guyuan, and from Guyuan to Dushikou. If they are unfortunately defeated, they will retreat into the Japanese military protection zone. As a result, we are forced to respond urgently, while the enemy can advance and retreat freely. Moreover, the Japanese are full of tricks. At this time, because of the internal dispute between the hard and soft factions, the Japanese warlords have not yet had a concrete expression in North China. Once a strategy is decided, they will use the banner of the fallen Qing Dynasty to create a puppet. There is no way to deal with people with higher cultural levels, but they can incite the economically declining people of Inner Mongolia and induce them to secede. This is the most important thing to pay attention to in all the aftermath of the Chahar Incident. Today's priority is to prevent Chahar from repeating the mistakes of Rehe. Even if we are limited by our strength and cannot recover the lost territory for a while, we must firmly defend the current position and consolidate all our strength to wait for an opportunity to recover.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Return to Invest in Large Numbers</p>

<p>Another group of overseas Chinese from Singapore and Java has arrived from Singapore, returning to their motherland to invest in Chinese industry. The gradual effect of the overseas Chinese affairs bureau propaganda is evident. Among them, one overseas Chinese plans to establish a sugar factory and a department store in Shanghai, specializing in the sale of domestic goods. It is reported that the Chinese authorities will provide special benefits to returning overseas Chinese for their investments to protect their capital, products, and personal safety, and will also set up overseas Chinese affairs offices to receive them and provide consultations.

<p>Active Guerrilla Forces in Jilin</p>
<p>(Harbin) Approximately 5,000 guerrilla forces entrenched in the Hulin area of eastern Jilin Province recently received a large number of weapons from a certain country and began actively engaging in anti-Manchu actions. As a result, the Japanese and "Manchu" authorities decided on a resolute suppression policy and have already begun operations. The Jilin Garrison's Hirose Cavalry Unit and the puppet state's River Defense Fleet are attacking from both land and water, attempting to eliminate them in one fell swoop.

<p>Italian Air Squadron Completes Feat</p>
<p>Rome Prepares Grand Welcome</p>
<p>Arc de Triomphe and Streets Filled with Laurel Branches</p>
<p>City Adorned with Flags and Electric Torches in Celebration</p>
<p>▲ Havas Rome, 10th The Italian air squadron has successfully completed its flight and is about to return to Italy. The Fascist Party and the Aero Club are actively preparing a welcome. The ground along the route from the Constantine Arch of Triumph to the Piazza Venezia will be covered with laurel branches. When General Balbo and the pilots pass through the Arc de Triomphe, representatives of women's groups will present flowers. Artillery will fire salutes, church bells will ring, the entire city will be decorated with flags, and major institutions will light up in the evening. The word "Mussolini" will be formed with electric lights on high places in the city, so that it can be seen from all around Rome.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters Lisbon, 10th Today, General Balbo, commander of the Italian air squadron, said that the Italian air squadron would not be able to depart for Italy until Saturday or Sunday of this week, as they had to wait for the body of the mechanic Squeglia, who died in a crash, to arrive before taking off. General Balbo today recounted to reporters the journey from Ireland to Labrador, which was one of the most difficult legs of the entire trip, as no one had ever traveled that route before. All aviators had to go to Greenland first before going to Labrador. This afternoon, General Balbo presented transatlantic medals to the pilots. After receiving the medals, everyone shouted "Long live Mussolini" three times, followed by two minutes of silence in memory of Squeglia, General Balbo kissed each pilot twice. According to a dispatch from Vatican City, the Italian air squadron will fly over the Holy City before landing in Ostia, after which the Pope will receive General Balbo.</p>
<p>▲ Havas Berlin, 11th The success of the Italian air squadron's flight has caused Prussian Premier Goering to be pessimistic about Germany's position. Goering believed that "Germany will be subjected to the violence and arbitrary trampling of foreign aircraft." This was Goering's opinion expressed to reporters from his own media outlet, the "National Daily." As a result, Goering has ordered air defense exercises in various German cities. The newspaper recorded Goering's opinion, stating, "General Balbo's flight demonstrates one thing: that Germany has no military aircraft. Therefore, Germany cannot protect itself until other countries decide to disarm themselves. Germany will continue to demand the right to establish defenses and aircraft." Goering also said that the southern route is most suitable for air connections between Europe and North America. The Azores route will probably be adopted in the future, and two floating islands will be established between the Americas and the Azores for use as stops.</p>
<p>▲ Havas Rome, 11th The route that the Italian air squadron will take when flying back to Italy from the Portuguese capital has now been determined as follows: after departing, it will first fly over the mouth of the Tagus River, then pass Cape St. Vincent, Cape Trafalgar, along the right coast of Cadiz, pass through the Strait of Gibraltar, and reach the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea. After that, it will depart from the islands, pass Asinara Island, the Strait of Bonifacio, and Maddalena Island, and fly to the Italian port of Ostia.</p>

<p>Free State Blueshirts Disarmed</p>
<p>Leader Publicly Announces Fascism</p>
<p>Anti-Government Demonstration Today</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency Berlin, 11th General O'Duffy of the Irish Free State told reporters that his Blueshirts had all been disarmed. O'Duffy further stated that he intended to build a fascist state without a parliament. The old parliamentary system will be replaced by a corporate parliament, in which all sectors, including agriculture, industry, science, art, etc., will be represented. Political circles here now believe that de Valera's position is precarious, as the Blueshirts are hostile to him, and the opposition party of former Chairman Cosgrave is also at odds with him. In addition, the Irish Republican Army also contains elements of socialists and communists. The people of Southern Ireland are increasingly alarmed, as no one knows the exact number of weapons and ammunition held by all parties. In recent months, rumors have spread that suspicious ships have been unloading large quantities of weapons and ammunition on the Irish coast. The authorities have discovered several cases of secret arms storage, and the items seized have mostly been small machine guns.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency Dublin, 11th Members of the Blueshirts are now arriving here in large numbers, preparing to march on Sunday to commemorate the martyrs. What will happen at that time is unpredictable. General O'Duffy publicly announced for the first time in Congress today that he advocates fascism, which has further heightened public tension.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters London, 10th The activities of the National Socialist Party abroad continue to cause deep concern in European countries. Habbich's recent radio broadcast in Munich attacking the Austrian government is viewed as a serious event by diplomatic circles in London. However, countries are also willing to forgive the fact that it is difficult to abandon the position initially adopted by Hitler to gain public support and do not want to suppress the German government or make its work more difficult. Now, informed sources believe that Habbich may have received instructions from Berlin to stop interfering in Austrian affairs. All parties are now closely watching the actions of the German government to see if it keeps its word. In the current situation, it is generally believed that there is no need for Britain and France to immediately consult on how to respond.</p>

<p>Significance of Ju Zheng's Proposal to Release Prisoners on Bail</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xie Guansheng, Secretary-General of the Judicial Yuan, told reporters that President Ju's proposal to the Central Political Committee to vigorously implement bail for criminal offenders, reduce sentences, and strictly prohibit torture is of great significance. Recently, social unrest has increased, and there has been an increase in criminals. There are often suspects who have been detained for one or two years without being convicted, which is not in accordance with the law. Moreover, some have died due to poor sanitation. The law already has precedents for bail for unconvicted prisoners, and this proposal aims to promote it universally. As for sentence reduction and restoration of rights, the president of the Judicial Yuan can directly submit it to the National Government, but requesting approval from the Central Political Committee is a sign of special solemnity. Regarding torture, it has been explicitly prohibited before, but some places have not been effective in enforcing it. All countries have declared it a prohibition. This proposal is a reaffirmation of the prohibition. (China News Agency, 11th)</p>

<p>Chiang Kai-shek Convenes</p>
<h3>Five-Province Bandit Suppression Conference</h3>
<p>All Senior Generals Participating</p>
<p>Jointly Planning Detailed Suppression Measures</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Chairman Chiang is now fundamentally considering the reform and deployment of military and political affairs for bandit suppression in the five provinces, so that after the autumn harvest, he can completely eliminate the bandits in one fell swoop. Now that Chiang believes that the blockade of the bandit areas has reached perfection, it is urgently necessary to advance further into the bandit areas. He has specifically scheduled a Five-Province Bandit Suppression Conference to be held at Lushan on the 15th of this month. Those summoned to attend are the commanders-in-chief of the north, south, west, and east routes, the commanders-in-chief of various columns, the commanders of various armies, divisions, and brigades, and the relevant military officers of various senior military organizations. He has also telegraphed all bandit suppression generals, asking them to clearly state in writing their past experiences in suppressing the bandits, effective strategies, the strengths and weaknesses of both the bandits and our side, and their opinions on future suppression, so that they can be collected, reviewed, and planned as a whole to make detailed suppression measures. It is noted that Chiang previously convened a Five-Province Bandit Suppression Conference once in May, with the chiefs of staff, directors of staff, and deputy division commanders of various levels of troops participating most, which can be called a staff meeting. The proposals also focused on various methods of bandit suppression experience and effectiveness. This bandit suppression conference should be a collective discussion by the responsible senior generals to discuss the coordinated operations and all important military affairs of the five provinces' general offensive, so as to make large-scale arrangements and attacks, and strive to achieve practical results in the shortest possible time.

<h3>Song Zheyuan Returns to Zhangjiakou to Resume Post.</h3>
<p>Units of Feng Departed Northward, Provincial Government to be Taken Over by Qin, etc.</p>
<p>Song Telegraphed Generals in Ping, Saying Post-Settlement is Quite Difficult</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping: After the peaceful resolution of the Chahar situation was agreed upon, the various units of Feng Yuxiang and Fang Zhenwu in Xuanhua, Zhangjiakou and other places gradually moved north. As of yesterday, all of them had moved to Zhangbei, Kangbao, Shangdu, Duolun and other areas for temporary residence. Only Tong Linge's troops were left in Zhangjiakou to maintain law and order. Feng himself has not yet left and intends to discuss everything with Song Zheyuan before deciding on his next move. All handover procedures between Feng and Song were properly negotiated the day before yesterday. Yesterday, Song dispatched Qin Dechun, Guo Zhihan, Zhang Jiyong, etc., along with two regiments of Feng Zhian's division, Liu and Dai, to Zhangjiakou to take over the defense. Feng dispatched Tong Linge to handle the transfer of military and political power in Chahar Province, while the provincial government was taken over by Qin and others. After Qin and others arrived, they went to the provincial government to meet with Tong to handle the handover. The provincial government decided to reorganize immediately. Qin Dechun was internally designated as the Director of Civil Affairs, and Guo Zhihan as the Director of Finance. The candidates for the other departments have also been determined. Before the reorganization, Qin Dechun, Guo Zhihan, Zhang Jiyong, etc. were temporarily responsible for presiding over the government. Song Zheyuan originally intended to go to Zhangjiakou to resume his post after Feng left Zhangjiakou, but because Feng still had various issues that needed to be discussed with Song before leaving Zhang, he urged Song to go quickly. Song telegraphed He Yingqin last night to report everything and asked Jiang Bocheng to go to Xuanhua to meet Feng in Zhangjiakou, but Jiang replied to Song that he could not leave immediately because his affairs in Ping had not been completed and asked Song to go first. Song then left Xuanhua for the west yesterday afternoon and arrived in Zhangjiakou that night to meet with Feng. It is heard that Feng invited Song to Zhangjiakou to discuss three issues: (1) The issue of telegraphing to cancel the name. At the Shacheng meeting, Feng was originally required to telegraph to cancel the name of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. However, Feng's telegram only stated that he would hand over military power and did not mention canceling the name. The authorities suspected that he lacked sincerity or still had other intentions and insisted that he still had to send a telegram to make a statement. Feng believed that since he had handed over military power, the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Army would be canceled informally and there was no need to take this action to avoid being criticized for going back on his word. He also believed that the name of the Allied Army was anti-Japanese. Although the ceasefire agreement has been signed, the long-term resistance has not ended. If he publicly issued a telegram to cancel the name of the anti-Japanese army, it would also be inappropriate. Therefore, he intended to meet with Song to explain everything and ask Song to forward it to the authorities for explanation. (2) The issue of residence. The authorities attach great importance to Feng's future residence. At the Shacheng meeting, he was expected to go south and not go north to avoid being surrounded. Jiang and Wang also telegraphed Feng to urge him to leave Chahar and enter Beijing. Song Zheyuan and those who are running around for this matter advocate adopting a compromise solution and ask him to live south of Tianjin, which means Shandong. Feng's idea is that after handing over military and political power, he will be a civilian and his residence should be free and not restricted. He has not yet replied to the telegrams from Jiang and Wang. This is also an issue that Feng needs to discuss with Song. (3) The issue of troop reorganization. Since the incident, Feng has recruited a large number of troops, and the internal structure of the Allied Army is also extremely complicated. How to reorganize them is quite troublesome. Since Feng recruited people from all sides for anti-Japanese purposes, he intends to find ways to settle his subordinates even if he has to end it now. This needs to be discussed in detail with Song to determine a proper solution. For these reasons, Feng strongly urged Song to come to Zhangjiakou for a meeting. Now that Song has arrived in Zhangjiakou, there must be a perfect solution. Judging from the internal and external situation, although Feng has handed over military and political power, the post-settlement is extremely difficult. Song Zheyuan telegraphed Shang Zhen, Gao Guizi, Wan Fulin, etc. this morning, saying that there are no major problems in the future, but the post-settlement is complicated and difficult. (August 10)</p>
<p>(Situation of Taking Over Zhangjiakou)</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Chahar Province and Commander-in-Chief of the Third Army Corps, dispatched Qin Zongchun, Deng Zhexi, Li Qi, Zhang Jiyong, etc. by special train to Zhangjiakou to visit Feng Yuxiang and discuss the handover of military and political affairs in Chahar Province as soon as he arrived in Xuanhua on the 7th. After Qin and others arrived in Zhangjiakou, they went to visit Feng Yuxiang and Fang Zhenwu, and met with Tong Linge and others successively. They raised three issues: (1) The handover method of military and political affairs in Chahar Province; (2) The deadline for the withdrawal of troops stationed in Zhangjiakou; (3) Feng's personal residence. Feng immediately stated that he had telegraphed to declare the handover of Chahar's political power, and Song Mingxuan had also come to take over and be responsible. All handover matters could be handled at any time. The troops stationed in Zhangjiakou had begun to concentrate in Zhangbei and would soon be withdrawn from Zhangjiakou. He did not want to express any opinion on the issue of personal residence. Qin and others believed that the reception issue was satisfactorily negotiated and returned to Xuanhua by special train with Feng's representative Zhang Yuanrong and Fang's representative Ruan Xuanwu at 5 pm on the 8th to report to Song on their trip to Zhangjiakou. Zhang and Ruan brought a letter from Feng to Song, welcoming him back to Chahar to take charge. After Qin Zhang Ruan et al. arrived in Xuanhua, they invited Jiang Bocheng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Military Branch, and the chiefs of various departments of the headquarters to discuss the takeover method and decided: (1) Send Qin Dechun to lead the team to take over Zhangjiakou on the morning of the 9th; (2) Send Guo Zhihan, Zhang Jiyong, Chen Xiwento take charge of receiving the Chahar Provincial Government. After the method was decided, it was implemented separately yesterday. Jiang Bocheng also returned to Ping by special train at 2:20 am on the 9th to report the progress to He Yingqin, while Qin Dechun and others also went to Zhangjiakou on the morning of the 9th to implement the transfer of power. Song Zheyuan then came to Zhang on the 10th. The two regiments of Feng Zhian Division and Liu Dai of the Song Department had already left for the north the day before they opened Zhangjiakou, so after the Song Department arrived in Zhang, they got off at the designated location of the provincial government. The defense area of Xuanhua was taken over by Pang Bingxun Department. The Pang Army had concentrated in Shacheng yesterday. After the vehicles transporting the Song Army returned to Shacheng, they boarded the vehicles and drove to Xuanhua. Pang's headquarters will be located in Xuanhua or Xinzhuangzi. The Shacheng defense area left by Pang's army was decided to be taken over by Feng Qinzai's Department. Feng had ordered Wu Mianzhi's Department of the Independent First Brigade to drive to Shacheng on the 10th. Feng's division was still stationed in Huailai, and the 3rd and 7th teams of the railway artillery team staying in Kangzhuang advanced west on the 9th to guard the Ping Sui line. The first and second armored trains arrived in Shacheng Huailai area on the 9th one after another.</p>
<p>The Ping-Sui Railway was suddenly interrupted on the 30th of last month and has been interrupted for more than ten days. Now that the Chahar incident has come to an end, the Ping-Sui Railway Administration specifically ordered the stations along the line at 10 am today (the 10th) to announce that the Ping-Bao through train service will be restored immediately, and that all passenger and freight trains will still run as usual from tomorrow (the 11th).

<h3>Break in Dike in Changyuan County, Hebei</h3>
<p>Water Will Soon Reach Shandong</p>
<p>But Not With Much Force</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The people's embankment in Changyuan, Hebei, was suddenly breached by bandits in two places on the 3rd. The water was pouring northeast. The area is adjacent to Shandong. It is more than a hundred li from Shitou Village in Changyuan to Ermen Village in Puyang. The head of the water has arrived after four and a half days. According to the calculation of time, it may reach the territory of Puyang County, Shandong, on the 12th or 13th. The River Affairs Bureau has sent personnel to investigate. Bureau Chief Zhang Lianjia said that if the water were to irrigate Shandong, the three counties of Fan County, Yanggu, and Shouzhang in the river bend would be the first to suffer. He crossed the river from Shilipu to the north bank to inspect the water situation. After inspecting the upper reaches, he returned to Jinan today (the 10th). In the afternoon, he went to the provincial government to meet with Han Fuqu and reported on the inspection. According to Zhang, the seven dikes of Li Sheng's ten dams were very dangerous before. After emergency repairs, they were safe. When the river water rose sharply last month, the people's embankments in the upper reaches all depended on the water. Kangtun and Lilou were the most dangerous. If the water rose again, the people's embankments would be breached. About 70% or 80% of the middle reaches also depend on the water, but the main embankment is safe. The water from the breach in Changyuan is very slow and not much. It is estimated that it will not have much force when it reaches Shandong. Only the residents in the river bend may suffer some damage.</p>
<p>The River Affairs Bureau telegraphed the provincial government to report on the situation after the breach in Changyuan, the original text of which read: "In the case of two breaches in the north bank of the Yellow River in Changyuan County, Hebei Province, this bureau once instructed Yiri Dian to report the opening and the counties through which the water flows, and to report the findings. In accordance with this, the head of the first section of the north, Xu Desheng, reported that the head of the water had flowed to the Ximen Village in Puyang County, about two li, about ten meters wide and about two inches deep. It is moving slowly to the northeast through the dike south gully, about ninety li away from the high dike of the north bank of Lu Puyang County, etc. In addition to still instructing the section chief to continue to report, I hereby telegraphed Chen, Acting Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, Zhang Lianjia," (10th)</p>

<h3>Sudden Death Cases Occurred in Recent Days</h3>
<p>The autumn climate is hot, even more so than the summer heat. Whenever the sun sets, the general workers often play in the river to cool off. Last night (the 10th), Gu Jinlin, the gatekeeper of Le En Tang outside the west gate, swam in the river in front of the hall after dinner. He accidentally sank to the bottom of the river. Only bubbles were seen, but the person was not seen swimming up. It was known that he had drowned. The gang boat of the hall salvaged the body, and the local town police reported to the procuratorate, who went to inspect it this morning and ordered the family to collect the body. Also, Shen Yunguan, a resident in the east of the county government, suddenly hanged himself this morning. According to Shen Yunguan, his family was poor and he had some addictions. He was unemployed at home and could not make ends meet. His wife worked as a milkmaid in Shanghai, recently suffered from heat sores, and was dismissed back to Songjiang. The whole family was in despair. So the deceased had the idea of dying and hanged himself with a rope on the rice basket hook in the stove without anyone knowing. The death was tragic.</p>

<h3>Wang Tao, Who Murdered Her Own Son, Was Strangled Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Wang Tao, of Zhujing Cang Street West, Jinshan County, who murdered her own son Wang Diqing, had repeatedly appealed, and was finally strangled by the Jiangsu High Court Procuratorate yesterday morning (the 11th). The details are as follows: Wang Tao's husband's name was Wang Shaofeng, who had considerable property in Zhujing. After Shaofeng's death, his property was managed by his cousin Yutian, who often lived in Shaofeng's house, causing him to fall in love with his widowed sister-in-law Wang Tao. At that time, Shaofeng's son, Wang Diqing, had grown up and married Wang Chen Shuying. Because he did not approve of what his mother did, he once drove Yutian away, resulting in discord between the mother and son. Wang Tao then took advantage of Diqing's deep sleep in the room at 7 pm on June 20th of the Republic of China (1931), and together with the hired worker Xia Aqing and the wet nurse Zhang Mama, held him down and strangled him with a rope. After the case was discovered, Wang Tao refused to accept the death sentence imposed by the original county and appealed to the Suzhou High Court, and then appealed to the Supreme Court. In the end, Wang Yutian was sentenced to seven years in prison and has been returned to the original county for execution. Xia Aqing has died of emaciation outside the Suzhou prison. Zhang Mama was sentenced to twelve years in prison and is currently being held in Suzhou prison. Wang Tao's appeal was rejected. Counting from the time she was sent to Suzhou on August 19th of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), she was in the Suzhou Third Prison for two years. After Chief Prosecutor Wang of the High Court received the execution order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration on the 10th, Prosecutor Zhu Jun and Secretary Lu Shixiang went to the Third Prison on Siqian Street at about 7 am yesterday (the 11th). First, Prison Director Chen Zhen ordered the security director Jin Cheng to announce martial law and close the prison gate. Then Zhu, Lu, and Chen took their seats in the temporary public case in the workshop of the cross prison. The guard threw the key to the tenth cell of the women's prison into the locked door and summoned Wang Tao to come out. A total of ten prisoners were detained in the cross prison, including Zhang Mama. When Wang Tao heard the call, she knew that her end had come, so she said, "Don't rush, let me change my clothes." It took about five minutes to change her clothes. She was wearing a blue silk short shirt, black Indian silk pants, jade-colored silk socks, and new black cloth shoes. She knelt in front of the case in the workshop. Prosecutor Zhu Jun verified her identity and asked questions. She replied that she had no last words, but her body must be transported back to her hometown. How is this case? It is useless to say. Please notify my daughter-in-law Wang Chen Shuying to come to Suzhou to collect the body. If the body is thrown away, I will not be able to face my ancestors. After saying this, tears welled up in her eyes. She was given wine, which she took and drank in one gulp, and then she was given three steamed buns, which she shook her head and refused. Then she was ordered to be tied up. She said again, "I have lived to be fifty-one years old, and the result is so pitiful." Then she looked back at the executioner and said, "Please help me quickly, so as not to suffer too much pain." The bailiff tied her up according to law and escorted her to the execution ground. She recited Amitabha Buddha all the way. After she was put on the gallows, her face was covered with a cattail bag and the decision was implemented. She died of suffocation after five minutes, which was exactly 7:30 am. Prosecutor Zhu then verified that she had died of suffocation and ordered the local guarantors to collect the body first and wait for her family to claim it. Afterwards, Zhang Mama, who was sentenced to twelve years in prison in the same case, cried bitterly in the prison, saying that she had been taken care of by Wang Tao in the same place of detention. According to the guard, Wang Tao had always been peaceful in the prison. The charges against her are now recorded as follows: "For the purpose of announcing the charges against the executed prisoner Wang Tao, Wang Tao was the concubine of Wang Shaofeng. After Wang Shaofeng's death, all the family property was managed by his cousin Wang Yutian. Wang Yutian often lived in Wang Tao's house, so he developed an ambiguity with Wang Tao. After a long time, Wang Tao's son Diqing learned of it and did not approve of what his mother did. Therefore, the mother and son were at odds. Wang Tao then discussed with the hired worker Xia Aqing and the wet nurse Zhang Mama to put Wang Diqing to death. They discussed it many times, but they could not find a chance to implement it. On June 20th, the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), that is, at 7 pm on the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, Wang Tao saw Wang Diqing sleeping soundly in the room, so she and Xia Aqing and Zhang Mama sneaked into his room, held Wang Diqing down together, and strangled him with a belt. Then they hung the body on the beam with a rope, pretending to be suicide, hoping to cover it up. The case was reported by the Jinshan County Public Security Bureau to the Jinshan County Government, which handled it according to law and sentenced him to death. Later, he appealed to this court and the Supreme Court, but the appeals were rejected, and the approval of the Ministry of Judicial Administration was presented. This office has decided to execute the prisoner Wang Tao in the execution ground of the Third Prison of Jiangsu on the 11th of this month, and verify his identity and sentence him to strangulation according to law, so as to show the consequences. It should be announced immediately so that everyone knows."</p>

<h3>Crops Wither Due to Drought in Various Townships</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been dry and there has been no rain for a long time, which has had a great impact on the farmland in various townships. Although farmers have been scooping water all night, the river water has dried up, the soil has cracked, the rice stalks have withered, and the cotton chess has been short and stunted. Recently, various districts have reported the disaster situation to the county government through the district office, requesting that personnel be sent to the countryside for verification. As for the rural areas, such as Zhitang and Shenjia Town, because the fields are cut off from water, the crops are withered, and various superstitious acts have been taken. The local authorities in the countryside cannot prohibit them. However, according to the person in charge of the farm here, if it does not rain again within a week, the harvest this year will be hopeless.</p>

After arriving in court, the presiding judge immediately read the main text of the judgment to her, stating that the original judgment was overturned except for the part concerning the incidental civil suit. Tao Sijin was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, with permanent deprivation of public rights. Xu Qinwen was found not guilty. If dissatisfied, an appeal could be filed within ten days after the judgment document was served. Tao remained silent upon hearing the verdict, her demeanor calm throughout. Afterwards, reporters visited her again, and Tao smiled, saying that life imprisonment was no different from death, and still terrifying. Therefore, whether to appeal this time would be decided after her brother, Pei Lin, came to Hangzhou and consulted with a lawyer. Tao then inquired about recent news of Liu Wenru. The reporter replied that he did not know and left. However, although Xu Qinwen was separately released on bail for the case of Song Yuanming endangering the Republic, it still needs to be resolved in a separate case. It is heard that the prosecutor's office believes the sentence is too lenient and will file another appeal.</p>

<h3>United States Restricts Chinese Students Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>Requiring a certificate from the Public Security Bureau proving a lifetime without criminal record</p>
<p>More than twenty cultural organizations, including the Municipal Education Bureau, held a farewell conference for students going to Europe and America this year, scheduled for 1:00 PM tomorrow at the Municipal Government Reception Room, No. 1881 Xiafei Road. Invitations to attend were sent out to all sectors several days ago, and a grand occasion is expected. However, students studying in the United States are affected because the United States government recently issued instructions to Mr. Kebenhan, the US Consul General in Shanghai, that this year's Chinese students going to the United States at their own expense and government students, in addition to the procedures handled as before, each student going to the United States must first obtain a "birth certificate" and a "certificate of no criminal record in their lifetime" from the local Chinese Public Security Bureau, otherwise their qualification to study abroad will be cancelled, and they will not be allowed to land and enroll in the United States. This regulation is a harsh measure unique to our country and does not exist in European countries. The relevant regulations were only temporarily notified by the Consulate General when this year's students going to the United States went to the US Consulate to sign for passports, causing students who were preparing to go to the United States in one or two days to have to return their boat tickets and request the government to find a way to negotiate. At the same time, it is heard that the Municipal Public Security Bureau also believes that this harsh regulation was not notified in advance and disrespects our national character, so it intends to report to the Municipal Government to formally negotiate with the United States Consul.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Cuba Killed</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese organizations to protest to the United States</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that the revolutionary wave in Cuba is intensifying. The day before yesterday, General Pitera, the Cuban Minister to China, told Xin Sheng She reporters that he could guarantee the safety of overseas Chinese in Cuba. Unexpectedly, a Reuters dispatch from London yesterday reported that four overseas Chinese in Havana had been killed one after another. The reporter then inquired about news from overseas Chinese organizations, and learned that there are a total of sixty to seventy thousand overseas Chinese there. Since the world economic recession, thirty to forty thousand overseas Chinese have returned home due to unemployment, so there are only thirty to forty thousand left in Cuba. Although Cuba is nominally an independent country and has an ambassador stationed in the United States, it is actually only in a semi-independent state. Its national economic rights, police power, etc. are all in the hands of the United States. The United States has huge investments there, and its customs administrative power is also controlled by the United States, so after the Cuban riots occurred, Britain and Spain, in order to protect the lives and property of their citizens, immediately protested directly to the United States and urged the United States to intervene in the riots. This time, several overseas Chinese were killed, and our country should also protest to the United States based on the facts, otherwise the losses of overseas Chinese will be even more unthinkable.</p>
<p>Aviation's Three Musketeers</p>
<h3>Joint Flight Around the Country</h3>
<p>Feng Yong, Sun Tonggang, and Chen Wenlin invited to join</p>
<p>Guo Wen She reports that Sun Tonggang, a pilot who studied in Germany, flew his own plane on a long-distance European-Asian flight last month. After returning to China and passing through Beijing, he stayed briefly and then went to Jinan to visit relatives. Although Mayor Wu of this city, the Aviation Association, and others sent telegrams to welcome him and urge him to come to Shanghai, there has been no definite date for his arrival. According to aviation experts in this city yesterday, after Sun returned to Jinan, he planned to make a national flight. Feng Yong, the former president of Northeastern University, was taking refuge from the summer heat in Qingdao, and after hearing that Sun had returned to China and arrived in Jinan, he went by plane out of admiration. After meeting, they mutually agreed to make a joint flight around the country, and Feng initiated a proposal to invite Chen Wenlin, the director of the Xiamen Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant, to join the joint flight, which was also approved by Sun. The Jiang Que aircraft that Chen is flying is currently staying in Shanghai, replacing the motor, and will be completed soon. The three aviation enthusiasts will be seen soaring and completing the feat of flying around the country, which will undoubtedly promote the public's aviation awareness. It is still unknown whether Sun will come to Shanghai with Feng Yong to depart from the same place as Chen, or whether Chen will go to Jinan to take off and stop in Shanghai again when passing through. However, if all sectors of this city warmly send telegrams to welcome them, Sun and Feng may come to Shanghai first. According to a special dispatch from Jinan on the 11th, Feng Yong flew here, and Sun Tonggang went to the airport to welcome him. Sun invited Feng and Chen Wenlin to make a national flight together to arouse the nation's attention to aviation. Feng has agreed. Feng met Han and decided to leave the plane he was traveling on in Jinan. Another telegram said that Feng Yong returned to Qingdao by car tonight. According to reports, he will still return to Jinan within a few days to fly to Beijing. Sun Tonggang went to Mount Tai on the 11th, and the date of flying to Shanghai is undecided.</p>

<p>Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Joint Association</p>
<h3>Striving to Improve the New Tax</h3>
<p>The results of the meeting were submitted to the authorities</p>
<p>The Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association held its first second standing committee meeting the day before yesterday, chaired by Zhang Dalian. ㈠ Discussed the counter-measures against Huang Yuming's lawsuit against Yu Jinhuang. A resolution was made that all litigation costs in this case would be formally paid by the association. Passed. ㈠ Discussed whether to continue striving for improvement of the rules regarding the new tax. It was resolved to continue striving for improvement. At a minimum, the goal of improving the rules must be achieved, otherwise any sacrifice will be worthwhile. ㈠ Discussed the letter from Standing Committee member Cao, 1. What is the rate of the new tax per hundred? If there is no clear regulation, it absolutely cannot be recognized; 2. The market scale has not been unified nationwide. Why should tobacco and alcohol merchants be required to use the market scale as the standard? It was resolved to submit a request to the tax authorities based on the original proposal for a clear explanation. Passed. ㈠ Discussed the letter from Standing Committee member Dai, 1. Fundamentally overturn the dual-track approach of simultaneous enforcement; 2. Shanghai tobacco and alcohol merchants must have the determination and serious countermeasures against the new tax. It was resolved that, regarding the first point, an administrative appeal would be filed based on Standing Committee member Cao's letter, and it would be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission. Regarding the second point, the fighting situation of Shanghai's tobacco and alcohol merchants will be recorded in detail in the bulletin and sent for review to clarify the truth. Passed. ㈠ Yu Xunlu proposed that the new tobacco tax lacked any identification, and that there was no distinction between good and bad, and that a uniform tax of four yuan, one jiao, and five fen was levied. Before this case is properly resolved, all tobacco producing areas should be notified to strive together for graded taxation, and that autumn tobacco skins should be taxed at half price. It was resolved to notify all tobacco producing areas according to the original proposal to strive together, and to request the tax authorities to tax cheap tobacco discards at half price. Passed. ㈠ Yu Xunlu proposed that the new tax was so severe that farmers in Tongxiang, western Zhejiang, could not sell their tobacco, causing rice riots. This matter concerns local peace and security and has a significant impact. A request should be submitted to the Executive Yuan and the tax authorities to properly maintain it. It was resolved to pass the original proposal. ㈠ Huang Wenqing proposed that the special tobacco leaf tax should be levied in grades. It was resolved to handle it together with the previous case. Passed. ㈠ The Yixing Wine Industry Association proposed that the tank scale differs greatly from the Suzhou scale. How should relief be provided, and should tax refunds be recognized? It was resolved to handle it together with Standing Committee member Cao's proposal. Passed. ㈠ Huang Wenqing proposed that if the tax authorities do not give a satisfactory response to the association's request to forward to the tax authorities the request from the Shaoxing Wine Industry Association to remove Huang Yongyi from the Shangbao sub-bureau, what should be done? It was resolved to continue to submit the case to the Ministry of Finance for investigation and request the Control Yuan to investigate thoroughly. Passed.</p>
<p>The native wine industry demands the abolition of the new tax</p>
<h3>Tax Office Disapproves</h3>
<p>No opposition in seven provinces and other places where the tax rate is implemented</p>
<p>The tax office's change of the tax system should be at the request of merchants and people</p>
<p>Since the tax office implemented the fixed-amount tax on local wine, the local wine merchants in this city have demanded its abolition without success, leading to a halt in brewing and transportation. The turmoil has expanded and has not yet been resolved. A reporter from China East News visited the director of the relevant department of the tax office yesterday to inquire about his attitude towards this case. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Director Fang Speaks</h3>
<p>According to Director Fang, it is difficult to make concessions on this matter, so a rejection was issued yesterday. The reason why the tax office cancelled the public sale method and formulated a fixed-amount tax was actually due to the appeal of merchants from various provinces. The drawbacks of the past public sale method were well known. Even though the tax office had made thorough rectifications since merging the public sale bureau last year, it was ultimately impossible to improve due to deeply ingrained habits. It was also due to the appeal of merchants and people that there was a plan for reform, which led to the creation of this fixed-amount tax and the abolition of the public sale system. This move was actually for the tax office to clear up long-standing abuses and relieve the suffering of merchants and people. Considering the situation of the past public sale system, the past public sale system determined the amount of tax based on the price of goods, and there were extremely numerous tax categories. The tax receipts were issued by both the Ministry and the Bureau, and each tax form could be filled out arbitrarily by the public sale bureau itself, from one yuan to thousands of yuan. This created a lot of room for manipulation. Merchants and people could be subject to the whims of the tax collectors in determining the amount of tax, and it was difficult for the collected taxes to be remitted to the public treasury. The fixed-amount tax now issues a tax receipt, similar to a postage stamp from the post office. The amount of tax is paid once based on the weight, and the procedure is completed. Unless leaving the province, it will not be taxed again. Merchants and people can be free from complicated procedures, and there are regulations for paying taxes, and the Ministry of Finance's tax revenue can also be remitted to the public treasury. Unexpectedly, since its implementation, some merchants and people have misunderstood the facts and opposed it. There are indeed many people who have understood after explanation, but there are also those who blindly follow suit. However, legitimate merchants mostly express understanding and are happy to accept it. Therefore, although there have been rumors of halting brewing and transportation in recent days, those who pay taxes according to regulations are still present. The tax office cannot be sure whether someone is instigating this action by merchants, but it also cannot say that there are no other intentions. However, judging from their actions, it can still be excused. Therefore, in addition to separately explaining, it is also stated that if there are overly complicated procedures or other inconveniences in the implementation of the tax rate, they can be reported to the office without violating the principles, and the tax office will be happy to accept it. If it is a matter of coercing the public, the tax office will never revoke the original proposal due to intimidation. All tax rates of the tax office have been implemented without complaint since their implementation. For example, in the case of beer, there are the most foreign merchants. They all pay taxes according to regulations without difficulty. How can domestic merchants misunderstand the content and arbitrarily obstruct it? Also, the seven provinces of Suzhou, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, and Fujian were selected to implement the tax rate at the same time, and there was no opposition in other places, but this place is the exception. From this, it can be known whether this tax rate increases the burden on merchants and people.</p>
<h3>Tax Office's Response</h3>
<p>The tax office yesterday sent a response to the Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou Wine and Tobacco Industries Association, stating that after investigation, special printing licenses were a bad habit left over from the Northern Government era. This time, the tax system was revised, abuses were eliminated, and collection was unified. There is absolutely no reason to retain these printing licenses. The fixed-amount tax on local wine should be verified and collected in accordance with regulations. The collecting agency cannot demand extra, and merchants cannot interfere with underpayment. The above two points were first rejected in detail in the petition submitted by the association, and the rejection has been copied and sent for review. Also, the association's original letter stated that the new tax hindered business, but there was no mention of the reason why, and there was no way to review and approve it. The association's previous contribution of opinions has been ordered to be implemented by the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Wine Tax Bureau in accordance with the record. In short, in order to reorganize tax revenue, the new regulations must be implemented. All merchants who believe that the procedures are difficult, all those that do not violate the principles, have been ordered by this office to adjust as appropriate to show consideration for the merchants' situation. The association should not insist on its own views, regardless of the right and wrong of the matter, and report the suspension of transportation and brewing as an unreasonable coercion, which is destroying the reorganization of the tax system and is not appropriate. As for freedom of business, it cannot be interfered with by others. The association has declared that it will notify the workers of all workshops to stop working and has appointed many people to monitor in sections. If this is implemented, it is close to harming the industry and obstructing tax administration. It should be known that this kind of action has exceeded the scope stipulated by the association's regulations and should be stopped immediately. If you continue to make trouble unreasonably, this office will only handle it according to the law and will never be lenient. The association, as an organization of the wine and tobacco industries, should be able to understand the overall situation and inform all merchants to know the importance. This is the response.</p>
<p>Collecting Land Value Tax</p>
<h3>The two bureaus are preparing implementation details</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of collecting land value tax in this city, all the collection regulations and the organization regulations of the valuation committee have been approved by the central government for the record, and the valuation committee has also been formally established a few days ago. They are currently working on the measurement of land in the city area and the estimation of land prices. It is learned that the Land and Finance Bureaus have recently prepared the implementation details of the provisional land value tax collection regulations and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval and publication by the bureaus, so that the provisional land value tax can be collected step by step from now on. The implementation details of the regulations are recorded below ▲Draft Implementation Details of the Shanghai Provisional Land Value Tax Collection Regulations (Article 1) These implementation details are formulated in accordance with Article 16 of the Shanghai Provisional Land Value Tax Collection Regulations (Article 2) The city area for collecting the provisional land value tax shall have its boundaries formulated by the Land Bureau and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and publication in conjunction with the Finance Bureau.

(Article 4) The declaration of land value shall state the following items: ㈠ The owner or leaseholder shall state their address and mailing address (if using a hall name, the name of the representative of the hall must be added; if it is a group or store, the name of the authorized representative of the group or store must be added); ㈡ Household name; ㈢ Land location (district map, embankment number, lot); ㈣ Land area; ㈤ Value per mu; ㈥ Current land use; ㈦ If there is a pledge, mortgage, or fixed-term lease relationship, the names and addresses of the related parties must be separately stated; ㈧ If it is land applying for tax exemption, the reason for tax exemption should be stated in detail; ㈨ If it is a declaration by an agent, the name and address of the agent should be stated in detail. (Article 5) To estimate the land value, the Land Bureau shall divide the area for collecting the provisional land value tax that has been delineated and announced into several zones based on similar land prices in each map, estimate the average land price of each zone, and use it as the standard for collecting the land value tax. However, if there are special areas that cannot be averaged, they should be estimated separately. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Brewing Wider Labor Strikes</h3>
<p>The union will convene a general meeting to decide</p>
<p>The leaf department continued to work slowly yesterday</p>
<p>National News Agency reports that the case of the leaf department workers at the British American Tobacco Pudong Old Factory working slowly has not been resolved as of yesterday. All workers went to the factory as usual, but did not work. Other departments such as tin packaging have been affected yesterday, and some have no work to do.

Yesterday, the union issued a message to workers because the factory seized the labor education rights and violated the contract, urging workers to strive together. The Fifth District Cigarette Workers Union has scheduled a general meeting of all representatives within the next few days to discuss various pending issues. At that time, it may be decided to expand the labor strike, and all 10,000 workers in the three factories will be mobilized at the same time. It is currently brewing.</p>
<p>China Merchants South Wharf Sandetang Property</p>
<h3>The mortgage has expired and a decision has been made to redeem it with funds</h3>
<p>Redemption price of 257,000 yuan</p>
<p>Due on the 15th of this month</p>
<p>Among the properties of the China Merchants South Wharf is a portion that is the land of the Sandetang of the French Catholic Church. In the spring of the year before last, the lease term expired, and Sandetang wanted to take back the property. At that time, Cai Ziping, the acting general manager, handled the negotiation. After several difficulties, it was purchased by the bureau and mortgaged, but it has not been transferred. Now that the lease term has arrived again, Sandetang has refused to continue the mortgage, and the bureau has to prepare the funds for redemption, transfer registration, and fundamentally resolve the long-standing disputes. The details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>The property is located in the Jinliyuan Wharf area, French character No. 69, and is located between the bureau's properties. The properties of French register No. 74 and No. 64 are adjacent to the South Wharf Wharf and are used to build warehouses. Because of their important location, they were leased from the Sandetang of the French Catholic Church. The No. 69 property occupies one mu and one fen of land and is also part of the current Jinliyuan Warehouse. In the past, the bureau rented it because Sandetang did not agree to sell it. In the spring of the 20th year of the Republic of China, a dispute over the recovery of land occurred due to rent arrears, causing a major negotiation.</p>
<p>The purchase of this matter occurred when Zhao Tieqiao was assassinated, and Cai Pei, the director of the Maritime Affairs Department of the Ministry of Communications, was ordered to come to Shanghai as the acting general manager. He negotiated with Sandetang through the French Consul General and purchased the property with funds from the bureau, and paid the rent arrears at the same time. After several months of negotiation, it was only on July 24 of that year that the matter was settled, and the bureau purchased it, totaling one mu, one fen, six li, and eight hao, for a total land price of 275,000 taels of silver. A purchase contract was signed at that time and registered with the French Consulate, but the Sandetang household name was still used and not changed.</p>
<p>The mortgage was because the bureau was in financial difficulties at the time and could not pay such a huge amount of money at once, so it still negotiated a mortgage with Sandetang and re-established a contract, mortgaging 220,000 taels of silver for a term of two years. After the term expired, both parties were free to continue the mortgage or terminate the contract. In the last month, General Manager Liu of the China Merchants Bureau, because the Sandetang mortgage was about to expire, sent personnel to negotiate with the French side in accordance with the agreement to extend the mortgage period, but it was rejected by Sandetang, who said that the Paris General Hall had no authority to grant the Shanghai Hall, so it could not be arbitrarily determined and was ordered to terminate the contract on schedule.</p>
<p>Redemption Yesterday, General Manager Liu stated that the Sandetang mortgage would expire on August 15, totaling 220,000 taels, excluding the 40,000 taels already paid, 180,000 taels should be prepared for purchase. Including interest, a total of 256,786 yuan and 4 cents must be paid. The property is important, and the mortgage is expiring in only two or three days and urgently needs to be redeemed. However, a huge amount of money is needed, so Liu Hongsheng submitted it to the Board of Directors, explaining the negotiation process with Sandetang and that it was difficult to delay any longer. The money to be purchased must be prepared and paid immediately so that the bureau can actually recover this long-disputed property and complete the transfer registration procedures after redemption.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce announces mediation</p>
<h3>The Ownership Dispute of Dianchuntang</h3>
<p>| Now declared broken, both parties are preparing to sue |</p>
<p>Regarding the ownership dispute of Dianchuntang between the Municipal Sugar Industry Association and the Seawater Products Industry Association, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened mediation and discussed three methods. Because the mediation has now broken down, both parties are preparing for legal proceedings. The Chamber of Commerce has specially announced the details as follows:</p>
<h3>The Seawater Products Industry Association moves into Dianchuntang</h3>
<p>The Seawater Products and Grocery Association reported to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on August 1, stating that they were moving their office and requesting approval and filing. The association's office was originally located at No. 10 Zhoushan Road, Second Special District. Because the lease of the premises has expired, the joint meeting of the directors and supervisors resolved to move back to the original association office in Dianchuntang, Yimiao on July 30 to facilitate matters. The association has prepared a document and requests your approval and filing for your kindness. We respectfully submit this for your perusal.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Industry Association requests arbitration from the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Sugar Industry Association requested arbitration from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: We are writing to inform you that the association's office is located at No. 168 Fuyou Road and holds a land business license No. 2597 as proof, which is clearly the association's ownership. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, the association established the Sugar Industry Elementary School, and then used the premises at that location, except for leaving one room as an office, and the rest were used as a school. Therefore, in addition to hanging the association's sign at the door, there was also the school sign of the Sugar Industry Elementary School. Unexpectedly, at around 10:00 AM on the 29th of this month, people claiming to be from the Seawater Products Industry Association, leading many people, rushed in and suddenly occupied the education dining hall, female teachers' dormitory, printing press, and other places that had been allocated by the association for school use. They claimed that it was their office and placed a large number of appliances they brought in the above-mentioned premises. All the school furniture that was originally in the room was discarded outdoors, and the association's sign was hung at the door. At that time, the association's staff explained to them earnestly, but they were ignorant of the people who came, who were aggressive and unapproachable. At that time, the association felt that under the violent acts, there was no way to reason, so it reported the situation to the second branch of the first district and requested them to stop the illegal behavior quickly. While the association was waiting quietly, the people claiming to be from the Seawater Products Industry Association gathered dozens of people in the association's office yesterday morning, held a meeting, had a meal, took pictures, and did whatever they wanted. Such blatant occupation is extremely illegal and could have been sued to the law and punished with the deserved crime.</p>
<p>However, since the association claimed to be the Seawater Products Industry Association and must be a member of your chamber, and since the association is under the leadership of your chamber, we respectfully request you to uphold justice and quickly arbitrate, otherwise the association will definitely file a lawsuit in accordance with the law where the property is located. We sincerely ask for your consideration.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Summons Mediation Result</h3>
<p>After receiving a request from the Sugar Industry Association, the City Chamber of Commerce immediately convened a mediation session on the afternoon of the 3rd. The results of the mediation were sent to both associations for their information. The letter stated: "Regarding your association's (Sugar Industry Association) letter stating that the Seafood Industry Association has forcibly occupied your association's premises and requesting a fair judgment, we convened both parties for a discussion on the afternoon of August 3rd.</p>
<p>Representatives present were Zheng Zenan and Xu Jingfu for the Sugar Industry Association, and Shao Xing and Ge Weiguang, among others, for the Seafood Industry Association. The mediation results were: 1. Both parties will cease legal proceedings during the mediation period. 2. Both parties will submit all relevant evidence to the Chamber of Commerce within three days, so that the Chamber can draft an inscription for a monument, which will be implemented after both parties agree. 3. Other issues will be discussed after the inscription is drafted and agreed upon by both parties." All representatives approved the record and signed it. In addition to sending separate letters, we are sending this letter to inform you of the situation.</p>
<h3>Seafood Industry Association Requests Cessation of Forced Eviction</h3>
<p>The Seafood and Grocery Trade Association sent another letter to the City Chamber of Commerce on [blank] date, stating (excerpt): "Our association complied and submitted evidence to your esteemed association for review on the 5th of this month. Unexpectedly, the Sugar Industry [Association] requested your association's mediation in name only, while secretly deceiving the Public Security Bureau, ordering the First District Second Branch to forcibly evict our association. Such a vicious tactic not only demonstrates a complete lack of sincerity in mediating this case, but also overturns the three-party agreement reached with your association. This reliance on power and oppression is outrageous. Since the Sugar Industry [Association] lacks sincerity, our association has no choice but to resort to legal action to protect our property rights. This was not our intention. We request that your esteemed association return the previously submitted evidence and uphold justice."</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Letter to City Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce immediately sent a letter to the City Public Security Bureau on the 8th, instructing the district branch not to accept requests from either party or take any action during the mediation period, in order to avoid disrupting the mediation. On the same day, separate letters were sent to the Sugar Industry and Seafood Industry Associations, stating: "Regarding the Seafood Industry Association's letter and the Sugar Industry Association's letter concerning the Sugar Industry Association's encroachment on the public property of Dianchun Hall,</p>
<p>after mediation and agreement on a solution, the Sugar Industry Association deceived the Public Security Bureau and ordered the First District Second Branch to forcibly evict [the Seafood Industry Association], overturning the three-party agreement and resorting to legal action. As the evidence has been submitted to the Chamber of Commerce by both associations as agreed, we should proceed according to the second item of the mediation agreement, where this Chamber will draft an inscription for a monument and then discuss other issues. Please refrain from taking any further action for the time being, so as not to disrupt the mediation efforts of this Chamber. This is of utmost importance."</p>
<h3>Sugar Industry Association Requests Termination of Mediation</h3>
<p>The Sugar Industry Association sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce on the 10th, stating: "Regarding our previous request to your esteemed association for a fair judgment in the case of the Seafood Industry Association's dispute over our association's property rights, we received a letter from you on the 7th, stating that no further action should be taken for the time being. We have since learned that the Seafood Industry Association suddenly consulted your association, requesting you to send a letter to the Public Security Bureau, urging them to delay the execution of the previous order issued to our sugar industry school regarding the forced eviction of the association that forcibly occupied the premises. However, your esteemed association approved this request. We believe this violates the statement about not taking any further action, and is akin to bias. Furthermore, the Seafood Industry Association has indicated to your esteemed association that it will resort to legal action. Therefore, our association is also preparing for a legal resolution to this case. We request that your esteemed association terminate the mediation. We also request that you inform the Public Security Bureau for their information."</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Reply to Sugar Industry Association Letter</h3>
<p>After receiving the letter from the Sugar Industry Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, in addition to sending the details of the case to the City Public Security Bureau, also replied to the Public Security Bureau, stating: "We received your letter on the 10th regarding the request to terminate the mediation of the Dianchun Hall case, which we will comply with. In addition to returning the previously submitted evidence, we have also informed the Seafood Industry Association. However, your letter accuses this Chamber of bias for instructing the Public Security Bureau to delay execution, which is a misrepresentation. The three items of the originally agreed upon mediation measures included the cessation of legal proceedings during the mediation period. This measure was to prevent the escalation of the dispute and is fundamentally incompatible with mediation. This cessation of legal proceedings is a necessary measure for mediation. This Chamber's letter on the 7th simply informed both parties of the mediation measures as agreed, and our request to the Public Security Bureau to temporarily postpone execution was also based on the original mediation agreement. Our only intention was to prevent the situation from worsening and to allow both parties to reconcile. However, your letter not only criticizes the Seafood Industry Association but also harbors resentment towards this Chamber, indicating bias and making reconciliation impossible. This is regrettable."</p>

<h3>Huang Yusu to Assume New Post in Mexico</h3>
<p>Responsible for Negotiating Anti-Chinese Wave</p>
<p>The anti-Chinese wave in Mexico is escalating, with many overseas Chinese forced to return home. The central government originally intended to send a special envoy to Mexico to handle negotiations and find ways to improve the treatment of overseas Chinese. It has now announced the appointment of Huang Yusu as Minister to Mexico. Huang previously served as Consul-General in Honolulu and San Francisco and has considerable familiarity with the Mexican government and people. He is scheduled to come to Shanghai from Beijing next week, take a ship abroad, and assume his new post in Mexico, to implement the central government's policy and be responsible for handling negotiations, so that the anti-Chinese wave in Mexico can be eliminated.</p>
<p>Increase in Postage to Southeast Asia</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Voice Strong Opposition</h3>
<p>Over Eighty Organizations in Singapore Jointly Submit Petition</p>
<p>Chinese Federation Sends Representatives to Beijing to Petition Authorities Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of increased postage to Southeast Asia, the Ministry of Communications has decided to implement it from September 1st. However, overseas Chinese organizations in various regions still firmly oppose it, urging the Ministry of Communications to withdraw the order. The Shanghai Chinese Federation previously received a joint letter from over eighty overseas Chinese organizations in Singapore, along with a petition to be forwarded to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Communications, entrusting Zhang Xuan, a member of the Federation's Executive Committee, as their representative to go to Beijing to petition the relevant authorities. At the same time, the Silver and Letter Business Associations in Shantou, Xiamen, and other places also telegraphed the Federation, expressing the same sentiment. Therefore, the Federation immediately appointed Supervisor Zhang Yongfu and Executive Committee member Zhang Xuan to carry the petition to Beijing yesterday to petition the authorities. The Federation's petition to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is excerpted below: "Petition requesting that the Ministry of Communications be requested to withdraw the order to increase postage for letters from overseas Chinese and appointing Supervisor Zhang Yongfu and Executive Committee member Zhang Xuan of this Federation as representatives to go to Beijing to petition, requesting review and approval as requested, in order to maintain the difficulties of overseas Chinese and show empathy. Since the Ministry of Communications announced the news of the increase in postage for letters from overseas Chinese, overseas Chinese in various regions have been extremely shocked and unable to rest. This Federation, entrusted by overseas Chinese at home and abroad, has repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Communications to withdraw the order, but it has not been approved to this day. Now, thousands of overseas Chinese organizations at home and abroad have sent joint letters and telegrams, stating their plight and requesting that your Commission forward the request, requesting your compassion for the difficulties of overseas Chinese and exemption from implementation of the increase. Overseas Chinese overseas, driven by hunger and cold, leave their homes and entrust themselves to foreign lands to seek survival. In recent years, the economic recession has spread throughout Southeast Asia, and the difficulties of making a living are truly unbearable. If further burdens are added, the meager resources they earn will not be enough to maintain their lives. Therefore, we have no choice but to petition your Commission, requesting that the Ministry of Communications be requested to find other ways to provide assistance, allow the withdrawal of the order, maintain the difficulties of overseas Chinese, and show empathy. The personal suffering of overseas Chinese is, we believe, already fully understood by your Commission, and we will not bother you further. While we were preparing the petition, we received another joint letter from Chinese organizations in Singapore, recommending Mr. Zhang Xuan as their representative to go to Beijing to petition, and we have combined our statements."</p>

<h3>Sharp Decline in Exports of Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>| Increase in Imports of Foreign Medicine |</p>
<p>Exports of Chinese medicinal materials from our country used to be very large. In recent years, various countries have generally prohibited the export of Chinese medicinal materials, so the export volume is far less than before. The import of foreign medicine, on the other hand, increases year by year, which is of great importance to our country's national economy and people's livelihood. According to the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday, the export volume of Chinese medicine and the import volume of foreign medicine are as follows:</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Exports The reason for the sharp decline in exports of Chinese medicine is due to the prohibition of exports by various countries. If no measures are taken to provide relief, the future will be dire. In recent years, the export volume of Chinese medicine is more than twice as low as in previous years. In 1931, the types and quantities of Chinese medicine exports were: Areca nut 77,614 yuan, Camphor 65,047 yuan, Poria cocos 429,355 yuan, Ginseng 506,434 yuan, Licorice 1,128,773 yuan, Citrus peel 28,620 yuan, Rhubarb 513,964 yuan, Cinnamon 1,126,377 yuan, Unlisted medicinal materials 6,402,618 yuan, totaling 10,278,802 yuan.</p>
<p>Dramatic Increase in Imports The import of foreign medicine increases year by year. Even in terms of the medicinal materials needed by traditional Chinese medicine, the increase is much greater than before. The import volume of Western medicine is hundreds of times greater than that of Chinese medicine. In 1931, the import of Chinese medicine was: Star anise 121,879 yuan, Dried areca nut 436,953 yuan, Amomum villosum and Amomum cardamomum 291,559 yuan, American ginseng 2,229,579 yuan, Pepper 837,741 yuan, Cinnamon 42,212 yuan, Clove 83,265 yuan, Unlisted medicinal materials 5,827,316 yuan, totaling 9,870,454 yuan.</p>
<p>Forensic Medicine Research Institute</p>
<h3>Recent Status of Recruiting Researchers</h3>
<p>Specialized Instructors in Each Department Have Been Hired</p>
<p>Surplus of Nominated and Volunteer Researchers</p>
<p>The Forensic Medicine Research Institute in Zhenru is recruiting the first batch of researchers, divided into three categories: recruitment, nomination, and voluntary. Ten people will be recruited, and the institute will provide a living allowance of 30 yuan per month. Twenty people will be nominated by the courts of various provinces, and the living expenses will be borne by the courts. Those who are unwilling to take the examination but have not been nominated and are interested in research will be reviewed for eligibility as voluntary self-funded researchers, with a quota of ten people. The examinations were held in both Ping and Shanghai and have been completed. Although there were many candidates, the results were not excellent, so only seven people were admitted. The specialized instructors for each department have also been hired, and classes will begin on September 1st. However, there is still a surplus of nominated and voluntary researchers to be filled. In addition to preparing documents to urge the courts of various provinces to send nominations, voluntary researchers are also planned to be recruited continuously. Those who are interested in forensic medicine can still report to the institute.</p>
<h3>Freight Car Derails on Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway This Morning</h3>
<p>Repaired at Noon But Delayed</p>
<p>At around 4:50 AM yesterday, the 407th downstream freight train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was approaching Jiaxing Station when, during the shunting of cars, suddenly two loaded boxcars, Nos. 107 and 1567, and one empty boxcar, No. 1005, derailed and fell between the third and fourth rail switches, causing both the main and branch lines to be blocked, disrupting traffic. Engineering personnel of the railway supervised workers to rush to repair it. First, the derailed vehicles were lifted back onto the tracks, and then the damaged tracks were repaired. It was finally completed at 11:05 AM and normal traffic was resumed. Therefore, the passenger cars coming from Hangzhou and leaving from Shanghai yesterday were slightly delayed. The 39th section passenger car, which was supposed to leave Jiaxing for Zhakou at 7:35 AM yesterday, did not depart until 12:30 PM, causing a delay of five hours.</p>
<h3>Optimistic Prospects for Henan White Coal Sales</h3>
<p>Our country's Henan Province, northern Xiuwu County, Jiaozuo area, has long been known for its smokeless white coal. Several years ago, it was transported and sold to the Yangtze River region and was greatly welcomed by users. However, due to repeated changes in the political situation and transportation disruptions, shortages have persisted for years. Those who favor domestically produced goods have lamented that while our country possesses this high-quality, excellent white coal, they are unable to purchase and use it, allowing imported products to dominate the market, which is truly regrettable. Upon investigation, Henan white coal is not only fire-resistant and clean, far surpassing other coals, but also more practical in terms of selling price and use. It cannot be competed with by the coal balls on the market. The composition of coal balls is mostly mud and dregs, and their heating power and durability are inferior to Henan smokeless white coal, while their selling price is higher. Therefore, economists, in order to save on coal burning costs, mostly purchase Henan smokeless white coal, which is clear evidence. Recently, Henan Zhongyuan Coal Mining Company and Fu Company have cooperated to establish the Zhongfu Joint Office, and have established the Shanghai Management Office at Room 127, 1st Floor, HSBC Bank Building, No. 1 Fuzhou Road, Shanghai, telephone number 15629. At the same time, a large batch of various smokeless white coals has been transported to supply the market. All coal dealers in this area have ready stock for sale. From now on, those who favor domestically produced goods can purchase this most economical and practical smokeless white coal at any time.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Street Merchants and Vendors Hold Tenth Meeting</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Street merchants, residents, and vegetable vendors in the southern city, for the construction of a vegetable market on Chezhan Road, held their tenth representative meeting yesterday. Chairman Zhang Mingchang reported on the following matters: 1) The petition to the municipal government on the 8th of this month; 2) As Huang Xingjie was the initiator of the Chezhan Road vegetable market proposal, a special trip was made to Mr. Huang Xingjie's residence to request that he, as the original proposer, withdraw the proposed plan from the charity organization and petition the authorities to withdraw their order. Matters for discussion: 1) It was resolved to request the charity organization to change its plan again. If the vegetable vendors gather themselves and make a request to the charity organization, the representatives will not be responsible. 2) It was resolved to determine the course of action after the municipal government's approval, striving to cancel the construction. 3) It was resolved to send letters to various organizations requesting prompt assistance. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Three Men and Women Die Tragically</h3>
<p>A fallen youth addicted to opium. Yang Huatian, a Cantonese man, 30 years old, was a receptionist at the Xin Xin Hotel on Nanjing Road in the Public Concession. However, Yang was young and loved pleasure. His meager salary was not enough to cover his extravagance. Therefore, he was heavily in debt and unable to make ends meet. He suffered endless pain in his mind. After much deliberation, he decided to end his life. At 8:30 the day before yesterday morning, he suddenly went to Room 12 in Block D of the Hongkou Hotel on Sichuan Road. He used the alias Lü Huiwu on the registration book. He went out once after his meal, and only returned at midnight. He then locked the door and went to sleep. Yesterday at noon, the waiter saw that he had not yet gotten up. Because of the hotel's rules, he went to inquire. When he knocked on the door several times, there was no response. He managed to force the door open and saw him lying in bed, barely breathing. An opium wine box was found on the table, with only a little residue remaining. Knowing that he had taken poison, he ordered an ambulance to take him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, he had taken too much poison, and the medicine was ineffective. He lingered until 6:00 PM and died. The body was transferred from the hospital to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<p>A young girl took poison in anger. Xie Wang, the 46-year-old female owner of a barbershop at No. 84 Naxiangfen Lane, Nanjing Road, was from Yangzhou. She had a daughter named Sanmao, who was 18 years old and of average appearance. The night before last, while cooling off in the street, the mother and daughter had a quarrel over a trivial matter. The mother scolded her severely. Afterwards, Sanmao was extremely distressed and went out to buy a lethal dose of opium and commit suicide. When her mother discovered that she had taken poison, she was immediately angered and also took her own life by swallowing opium paste, hoping to go to the underworld with her daughter. Soon, both of them showed signs of poisoning that could not be controlled. They were taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by friends. After the doctor gave them injections and gastric lavage, the mother recovered because she had taken a lighter dose. However, Sanmao's poison had entered her internal organs and she eventually could not be saved. She died at around 10:00 yesterday morning.</p>
<p>A young woman hanged herself for no reason. Du Wang, a 27-year-old young woman from Changzhou, lived at No. 519 Meizhou Road, Yangshupu. At around 10:00 yesterday morning, for unknown reasons, she had the thought of dying and hanged herself in her room. She was discovered by her family, who reported it to the police station. Police officer No. 286 went to investigate and took the body to Tongren Hospital for examination.</p>
<h3>A Chauffeur's Wife Dies from Poisoning</h3>
<p>Shen Zhou, a 22-year-old young woman, lived at No. 48 Tongkang Li, Huashun Road in the French Concession. Her husband was a chauffeur. At around 2:00 yesterday morning, two cohabitants had an argument, and she joined in the fray, almost resorting to violence. Her husband heard the noise and scolded her harshly. The commotion finally subsided. Zhou, feeling resentful and angry, secretly went out to buy opium and commit suicide while her husband was asleep. When her husband discovered it, he immediately took her to Renji Hospital, but it was too late. She died at dawn.</p>
<h3>Accusation of Kidnapping a Three-Year-Old Girl</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 2:00 PM, Wang Chen brought a kidnapper, Yuan Aqing, to the Second Precinct of the First District, claiming that her three-year-old daughter had been kidnapped by the defendant and was missing. She demanded an investigation. After questioning the defendant Yuan Aqing, Director Liu learned that he had lived with the plaintiff in the past and had a daughter who was adopted by Shen Longhai. Shen then sold her to Gu Wo for twelve yuan. As the case concerned the separation of flesh and blood, it was decided to send the case to the General Bureau for handling.</p>
<h3>Wang Zao Shi to Practice Law</h3>
<p>Dr. Wang Zao Shi, a former professor at various universities in Shanghai and Dean of the Faculty of Arts at Guanghua University, was reported yesterday to have joined the Shanghai Bar Association. It is said that he is scheduled to begin practicing law in the courts of Shanghai on the 13th of this month. According to Wang, there are two motivations for his resolute pursuit of law: 1) In recent years, the education sector has been increasingly influenced by politics and has become increasingly degraded. This path is becoming narrower and narrower, causing great pain. Although lawyers and professors are both free professions, lawyers are relatively more free and can act independently. 2) Protecting civil rights and promoting the rule of law is also a lifelong ambition. Therefore, after taking office, he will pay special attention to the protection of the weak and the poor. There is a lawyer in New York named Derance Carrow who specializes in righting wrongs and has greatly benefited the public. Although I (Wang calls himself) am not talented, I am willing to work in this direction. As for cultural undertakings, I will not abandon them. I plan to spend half a day engaged in translation and editing, and half a day engaged in legal affairs, or perhaps still teach a few hours of classes, which is also possible. It is reported that Wang shares an office with lawyer Zhang Shizhao, located at No. 3, Lane 12, Chengyu Village, Xiaoshadu Road, telephone number 33667. His residence is still at No. 3, Zhongzhenfang, Jisi fei er Road, telephone number 27186.</p>

<p>The Trunk Murder Case Takes a Dramatic Turn</p>
<h3>Chen Qiao Ying Is Still Alive</h3>
<p>Qiao Ying Went to the Japanese Consulate Yesterday Morning to Declare That She Is Not Dead</p>
<p>She Has Never Had More Than Forty Lovers in Her Life</p>
<p>丨Qiao Ying Has a Beautiful Face and Took a Photo with Sato丨</p>
<p>According to initial telegrams from the Japanese, the Shanghai Maru trunk murder case involved Chen Yongyuan's wife, Chen Qiao Ying, a Chinese barber in Yamashita-cho, Yokohama. It was also said that she had more than forty lovers in her lifetime, and that the female corpse in the Shanghai Maru's iron trunk was her true body after being murdered. However, after the evidence arrived in Shanghai on the 10th, yesterday a woman named Chen Qiao Ying went to the Japanese Consulate to prove that she had not been harmed. Strangely, the body in the trunk must be someone else and not Chen Qiao Ying, without a doubt. The following is an investigation report of yesterday's news.</p>
<p>Chen Qiao Ying Appears</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a woman aged about 23 suddenly went to the Japanese Consulate in this port to prove that her name was Chen Qiao Ying, the wife of Chen Yongyuan, a barber in Yamashita-cho, Yokohama. She was originally from Yangzhou and had been in Japan for a long time, so she could speak Japanese. She stated in the Japanese Consulate that she had returned to China from the East and had divorced her husband.</p>
<p>When describing the situation, she spoke fluent Japanese. Finally, she said that no one wanted to harm her, and the body in the trunk of the Shanghai Maru was another woman, definitely not Chen Qiao Ying.</p>
<p>Returned to China Last Month</p>
<p>Chen Qiao Ying said that she did not have forty lovers as the Japanese had reported. She only had three good male friends in Japan. What the Japanese said was completely inaccurate. Her relationship with her husband, Chen Yongyuan, had fractured in Japan, so both parties filed for divorce. When she and Chen Yongyuan divorced, they both reported to our country's consul stationed in Japan in accordance with our national laws to prove that she had severed the marital relationship with Chen Yongyuan. This time, she returned to China because her aunt had died, so she came to Shanghai from Japan in the third class cabin of the Tsukuba Maru on July 26.</p>
<p>Actions After Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>Chen Qiao Ying also said that after arriving in Shanghai from Japan, she went to Jiujiang Road to look for her uncle and lived there. She originally planned to accompany her aunt's coffin to Yangzhou, but because the trip to Japan was rushed, she had not brought back many clothes. Later, she wrote a letter entrusting Xu Shunlin, who was returning to China from the East, to bring them back to Shanghai. Xu also arrived in Shanghai on the Tsukuba Maru on the 9th of this month. She was still in Shanghai to retrieve her clothes and had not yet gone to Yangzhou. The woman also said that when she left Yokohama to return to China, three lovers went to the port to see her off and agreed to go to Japan again after finishing her affairs in China to reminisce about the past. Ms. Chen was wearing a white silk cheongsam, with her hair parted on both sides. She had a beautiful face. Sato, the criminal investigation director of the Japanese Consulate at the time, took a photo with her.</p>
<p>Japanese Police Officer Investigates</p>
<p>Since Chen Qiao Ying appeared, this case, which was previously thought to have leads, has been completely overturned. It is still unknown who the victim is. The police detectives of the Shanghai Japanese Consulate are waiting for the arrival of Hayashi, the chief of the Kobe Water Police Department, on the 15th of this month (arriving in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru), and then they will jointly conduct an investigation to clarify the truth of this case. However, according to the workers at the No. 7 pier of the Shanghai Travel Information Office who loaded the box, the person who delivered the box was a Chinese man about 35 or 36 years old. There is nothing else that can be used as evidence.</p>
<h3>Dispute Between a British Man and a Chinese Woman</h3>
<p>Did Her Parents Actually Consent?</p>
<p>Trouble Arises in the Dance Hall</p>
<p>Li Xiaomei, a dance girl from Beiping, is 19 years old, petite and exquisite, and especially proficient in English. She has been dancing at the Moon Palace Dance Hall in Hongkou. Recently, she fell in love with a British man named En, who works at a water and fire company, through dancing. They are extremely affectionate. The British man is willing to make a lifelong commitment to Xiaomei. Both parties are willing, but Xiaomei is not yet of age. According to current laws, her parents must provide a written consent form before it can be legal. Therefore, lawyer Huang Yuping was hired to notify her father, Li Zesheng, and mother, Li Qi, to provide a written consent form before officially marrying at the British Consulate on July 1. Huang Yuping also sent various certificates to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for certification. Unexpectedly, Xiaomei's mother, Li Qi, suddenly found her daughter at No. 1073 North Sichuan Road a few days ago and accused the British man En (transliteration) of seducing and abducting her daughter. She immediately turned him over to the nearby police station. After a detailed inquiry by the police chief, the defendant En presented the consent form signed by the plaintiff, stating that he had not abducted her. However, the plaintiff, Li Qi, said that the consent form was not written by her and was forged. The police chief dismissed the case because the plaintiff could not prove the forgery. Li Qi believed that the police chief was biased and filed a complaint with the First Branch of the Fifth District, accusing the British man En of abducting her daughter Xiaomei. Director Liang Fuchu asked where she had been abducted from. Li Qi stated that she and her daughter lived with a friend surnamed Liu at No. 39 Lixianli, Xixinqiao Street in the French Concession. She was abducted a month ago and has only been found now. Because she lacks money, she has not been able to sue the British man. Her husband, Li Zesheng, has gone to Nanjing to borrow money from relatives and friends to prepare for a lawsuit in Shanghai. Fearing that he would escape, she filed a complaint with the bureau requesting assistance. Director Liang believed that the case involved a foreigner and an underage woman, and the truth should be thoroughly investigated. He decided to send the case to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Dismissed Police Officer Accuses Station Chief of Protecting Gambling Rings</h3>
<p>Yi Fugen's Gambling Ring Operates on a Large Scale</p>
<p>After Being Accused, the Station Chief Was Detained by Court Order</p>
<p>The harm of gambling rings is like a flood or a beast. Therefore, they were driven from the Public Concession to the French Concession, and then severely suppressed. Recently, they have gradually moved to the Chinese area. There are two large gambling rings, one in the Wansheng Bridge area of the West Gate, called "Bo Geng Fan," which has no fixed location, and the other in Yongquanfang, Fangban Bridge. The operator of the large gambling ring is Yi Fugen, also known as Ma Pi Fugen, the gambling king of the Chinese area, known as the Old Ma Pi of Fangban Bridge. He has obtained tens of thousands of yuan from this inhumane and unconscionable money. His followers number over a thousand, and he is incredibly powerful. The local court's prosecutor's office has long been aware of him, but there has been no way to arrest him. Unexpectedly, police officers Zhang Xianzhang and Liu Wanxiang of the First Precinct of the Second District filed a complaint with the local court, accusing Yi Fugen of obstructing official duties and ordering them to do things. The defendants also included Zhang Zhaochang, Tang Dazhu, Gao Juchuan, Zhu Huashan, Ren Mian, Li Rongfu, Tang Abao, and others, claiming that Yi Fugen opened a gambling ring. We are police officers and originally received a monthly subsidy of two yuan each. However, he claimed that he was in contact with the station chief, so we only received it for three months and then it stopped. The day before yesterday, he gathered the defendants and injured us, preventing us from moving. We were bound and sent to the First Precinct of the Second District, and the station chief dismissed us instead. We are truly unwilling to accept this situation, so we request a thorough investigation. Chief Prosecutor Lou examined the complaint and stated that the rampant gambling in Shanghai had prompted the Higher Court to issue an order for arrests. There is such a large-scale organization near the city, which should be severely punished. Therefore, Prosecutor Wu immediately opened a court, examined the injuries, and immediately issued an arrest warrant. Early yesterday morning, Bailiff Zhu Baochang went to arrest him and immediately brought him to the court, ordering him to be detained pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Second-Class Sleeping Cars on the Beijing-Shanghai Line to Be Implemented Soon</h3>
<p>丨Upper Berth 2.5 Yuan, Lower Berth 3 Yuan丨</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration plans to open second-class sleeping cars to facilitate passengers and develop business. The reporter learned from the bureau yesterday that it will be implemented soon. The following is a record of the information obtained:</p>
<p>The motivation for the planning is that the Beijing-Shanghai line has always only had first-class sleeping cars, making it unaffordable for the middle class. Moreover, each car only accommodates sixteen people, which is often insufficient. At the Shanghai North Station, there are often more than a dozen people who want first-class berths but cannot get them. Especially on the night trains between Beijing-Shanghai Station and Zhenjiang-Nanjing, there are an average of more than one hundred second-class passengers every day. Some of them must need sleeping berths. Now that first-class sleeping berths are still insufficient, second-class sleeping berths can slightly supplement the supply, so that passengers will not feel disappointed. The railway bureau believes that the first-class sleeping car berths are fixed and not suitable for daytime use, and in terms of vehicles, it is too uneconomical. Therefore, the bureau recently submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways, which instructed the Machinery Department to build second-class sleeping cars in the American style.</p>
<p>Sleeping car construction The current second-class sleeping cars under construction cost 50,000 yuan per car, excluding the flat bottom, which is made of existing 68-foot-long underframes. The entire car body is made of high-quality teak, including all internal equipment. The style is modeled after the American style. Each car has upper and lower berths and can accommodate twenty-eight people. During the day, the berths can be removed and fifty-six passenger seats can be arranged, which is both convenient for passengers and economical for the railway.</p>
<p>Berth price As for the price of second-class sleeping car berths, the bureau plans to follow the Ministry's promulgated passenger transport regulations and set the price at 2.5 yuan per upper berth and 3 yuan per lower berth. However, this is only the price of the berth. If a second-class passenger is going to Beijing and needs a lower berth, they only need to add 3 yuan to the fare to enjoy the second-class sleeping car. The construction of the car is nearing completion and will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Major Electricity Theft Case Cracked in the South City</h3>
<p>丨Clerks and Craftsmen Collude丨</p>
<p>Zhu Shaoqi Pays Attention to Investigation</p>
<p>Detectives Put Forth Great Effort</p>
<p>The major electricity theft case captured in the Public Concession this year caused a sensation for a time. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team has cracked another major electricity theft case a few days ago. The inside story is that electrical material stores colluded with internal staff of the Chinese Electric Company to steal electricity for major businesses in the South City in exchange for rewards, which they divided and spent. The following is a detailed record of the various details obtained from the investigation:</p>
<p>Electricity Theft Uncovered The electricity used by citizens in the South City area is supplied by the Chinese Electric Company. However, some unscrupulous people colluded with major businesses and residents to steal electricity, causing the Chinese Electric Company to lose tens of thousands of yuan per month. Moreover, the methods used by these businesses and residents to steal electricity were very clever. Therefore, although the company has repeatedly issued notices and offered rewards for the arrest of electricity thieves for more than a decade, no one has ever been arrested.</p>
<p>Rectifying Electricity Theft Since Zhu Shaoqi, the director of the Vehicle Department of the company, was transferred to the director of the Lighting Department, the internal operations have been greatly rectified. He paid special attention to the electricity theft and, after several months of investigation, he discovered that the Mingxing Electrical Material Store on Minguo Road, Xiaodongmen, and the Wang Yaoji Electrical Material Store at No. 44 Kangjia Lane in the city were nominally selling electrical materials and installing electric lights. The truth is that they are dedicated to acting as the two general agencies for major businesses and stores in the South City to steal electricity. However, due to a lack of sufficient evidence, it was impossible to crack the case.</p>
<p>Yi Tai Absent from Work Yi Tai from Suzhou was a clerk in the Lighting Department of the Chinese Electric Company, specializing in sealing the lead seals on the meter boxes. This year, he was transferred to the Ticket Department. In March of this year, when Director Zhu was conducting a strict investigation of electricity theft, he paid special attention to the actions of internal staff. Therefore, Yi Tai suddenly stopped coming to the company for some reason. However, the company did not mind. On the one hand, it still submitted a request to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, instructing them to pay attention to the arrest of electricity thieves.</p>
<p>Obtaining the Main Criminal After receiving the report, Director Wen immediately ordered all district precincts to strictly investigate the case. It was not until recently that Gao Wansheng, the leader of the Detective Team, and detective Shi Yongquan, after a thorough investigation, discovered that the main criminal among the electricity thieves was Yi Tai, a clerk in the Ticket Department of the Lighting Department who had resigned without notice. However, Yi Tai's whereabouts were secretive and he had no fixed address. However, he often went to the Linchun Teahouse in Huajinli on Sima Road to drink tea.</p>
<p>Drinking Tea at the Teahouse The team leader was immediately informed and sent team leader Wang Shenqing, along with detectives Shen Wenda and Jiao Baojun, disguised as workers to the Linchun Teahouse at around 7:00 the day before yesterday afternoon. They pretended to be tea drinkers and drank tea at the table. Before long, Yi Tai arrived. They swarmed forward, arrested Yi, and took him to the police station. After a brief interrogation, they</p>
<p>Brought him to the team.</p>
<p>Negotiating Electricity Theft During the preliminary interrogation by the team leader, Yi stated that he was 26 years old and lived at No. 42 Xujiahui Road.</p>
<p>There was a local man named Ye Yusen, whose nickname was A Xiao, who opened the Mingxing Electrical Material Store in Xiaodongmen. Recently, he colluded with Wang Yaoting, the owner of the Wang Yaoji Electrical Material Store at No. 44 Tangjia Lane, and</p>
<p>His shop's craftsmen, Tong Jialiang, etc., contacted Hu Zhenbao, the manager of the Hongzhang Silk Satin Bureau in Xiaodongmen, and the Zhonghua Bathhouse in Xiaonanmen, the Wanyuanxiang Leather Goods Bureau in the city, a large sock factory, etc. to discuss electricity theft methods.</p>
<p>Opening Boxes and Reversing Codes The businesses, seeing that there was a profit to be made, readily agreed. Therefore, at the end of each month, when the staff of the Chinese Electric Company went to read the meter, Yi and others would first go to pry open the lead seal on the meter box. After opening the box, they would reverse the digits of the code and then close the box, using a pre-fabricated lead seal to seal it, so that there would be no trace.</p>
<p>Internal and External Liaison Ye and others were afraid of accidents and, in order to make the businesses trust that the people inside the Chinese Electric Company also knew about this electricity theft, so they contacted Xu Fusheng and Zhang Pingsheng, craftsmen in the company, to form an internal and external link, and to be able to inquire about everything in the company at any time.</p>
<p>Amount of Reward Fee According to statistics, the electricity theft lasted for a total of three months. The rewards received were 56 yuan in total for the Zhonghua Bathhouse for three months, 140 yuan for the Hongzhang Silk Satin Bureau for two months, 100 yuan for a large sock factory for three months, and 80 yuan for the Wanyuanxiang Leather Goods Bureau for two months. These rewards have all been divided and spent.</p>
<p>Arresting Many People The original detective team was dispatched</p>
<p>To the Chinese Electric Company to arrest the craftsman Zhang Pingsheng. However, Xu Fusheng had been laid off for some reason and his address was unknown, so there was no way to arrest him. Then, they went to the Mingxing and Wang Yaoji electrical material stores and arrested Tong Jialiang and Wang Yaoji one after another. However, the main criminal, Ye Yusen, etc., had fled upon hearing the news, so they were not arrested. The arrested criminals were taken back to the team.</p>
<p>Zhang Pingsheng Confesses During the interrogation, Zhang Pingsheng stated that he was 26 years old, from Nanhui, and lived at No. 86 Lannidu, Pudong.</p>
<p>He was a craftsman in the meter installation section of the Lighting Department of the Chinese Electric Company. In the spring of this year, when I was repairing electric lights at the Guochang Mall in Xiaodongmen, I was introduced to Ye Yusen by Tong Jialiang. Because his store's business was slow, Ye asked me to invite</p>
<p>Director Shen to dinner. Director Shen came to dinner with Yi Tai at that time, so Yi Tai got to know Ye Yusen. Later, Ye had the idea to forge lead seals and steal electricity for major businesses. Fearing that accidents would happen, he contacted me and Yi Tai, Xu Fusheng, etc. to work together and divide the rewards.</p>
<p>Tong Jialiang Confesses According to Tong Jialiang, he is 25 years old, from Ningbo, and is a craftsman at the Mingxing Electrical Material Store in Xiaodongmen. Ye Qiusen is indeed my shop owner, but because the business was not good, he transferred the store base to a friend named Fan to continue the business. Ye was unemployed at home and his finances were becoming increasingly strained, so he discussed with my friend Wang Yaoting to find a way to steal electricity. At that time, I happened to see Xu Ruisheng, Zhang Pingsheng, etc. installing meters in the Wanyuanxiang Leather Goods Bureau and a large sock factory, so I went to contact them about the electricity theft plan. Unexpectedly, Xu and others flatly refused. After several contacts, Xu and others finally agreed and introduced us to the Wanyuanxiang Leather Goods Bureau, etc., so we implemented electricity theft and contacted Yi Tai, etc.</p>
<p>To broaden our reach.</p>
<p>Wang Yaoting Confesses During the interrogation, Wang Yaoting stated that he was 29 years old, from Ningbo, and opened the Wang Yaoji Electrical Material Store in Kangjia Lane. The rest of his statement was the same as the statements of Yi Tai, Tong Jialiang, etc. It was decided that the number of drug stores they helped steal electricity was definitely more than just Hongzhang and the other four stores. Therefore, they ordered a written statement to be prepared and sent Yi and others to the bureau for interrogation. On the one hand, they ordered an investigation into other merchants who stole electricity, and to pursue and arrest the fugitives and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Commending Detectives Lu Bohong, the manager of the Chinese Electric Company, and Wen Hongen, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, etc., believed that it was not easy for detective Gao Wansheng and others to crack a major electricity theft case that had not been solved for more than ten years and planned to give them commendations soon to encourage them.</p>
<h3>Yong An Tang's Tiger Head Car</h3>
<p>Parades on the Streets Today</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Wenhu, the owner of Tiger Balm Garden Yong An Tang, has extremely high ideals and has always been admired. There are two things in Nanyang that are most noteworthy. One is that Mr. Hu, in view of the fact that foreign parks at home and abroad do not allow Chinese people to enter, set up a very large swimming pool in Nanyang, in the area of foreign influence, with a large sign at the entrance saying that foreigners were not allowed to enter. The other is his original design of a tiger head car. This car was specially custom-made in Germany. The tiger's eyes are bright and the tiger's whiskers are crisscrossed, as if alive. A few years ago, it won the first prize at a competition in England. Recently, it has been used for a long time and the Rising Peace Factory in England has been specially replaced with mechanical parts. It was transported to Shanghai by the branch of the hall to be used for advertising. This car has long been famous in Singapore, Nanyang. Foreign dignitaries who have passed through its port have all taken a ride. It has only just arrived in port. Yesterday, it landed at the dock and the onlookers were very crowded. It is said that this car has been parading on the streets today.</p>
<h3>Modification of Manifest Extension Fee</h3>
<p>The various shipping companies in this port, including China Merchants, Butterfield &amp; Swire, and Jardine Matheson, received a notice yesterday from Mr. Coddard, the Customs Commissioner of the General Affairs Department of the Jianghai Customs, which stated that, effective this month on the 17th (Monday), the current schedule of manifest extension fees will be modified as follows: After the 15-day period following the customs clearance of a cargo vessel, the first extension of five days will incur a fee of 30 yuan. The second and third extensions will also incur a fee of 30 yuan each. The fourth extension will incur a fee of 50 yuan, and the fifth extension will incur a fee of 80 yuan. By analogy, each extension of five days will incur an additional 25 cents. This schedule will be uniformly applied from the aforementioned date. However, if the continued extension fee has already reached three times or more and the five-day extension period falls on or after the 17th of this month, the fee will be charged according to the new schedule's fourth extension rate. All merchants are hereby notified.</p>

<h3>The Prosperous Area of Shanghai</h3>
<p>丨Indeed a Den of All Evil丨</p>
<p>A Girl from Qidong Admired the Wealth and Splendor of Shanghai</p>
<p>Tricked into Coming to Shanghai and Defiled by Ruffians</p>
<p>Ni Mingzhu, a child bride of Cai Xitang, a villager from the Republican Township of Qidong County, Jiangsu Province, was twenty-nine years old and of average appearance. She had been married for over ten years. However, on May 2nd of this year, she suddenly disappeared. Cai searched everywhere for her without success. Recently, Cai received a letter from the Shanghai Women and Children Relief Association, stating that Miss Ni was being cared for at the association and requesting that he come to claim her. Cai then came to Shanghai, took the girl out, and questioned her about what had happened. According to Ni Mingzhu, she had a neighbor named Shi Huibin in her hometown of Qidong, who told her that life at home was very difficult and described the wealth and splendor of Shanghai. She was thus incited by him and came to Shanghai with him. They first lived in Longhua for about twenty days. On May 24th, Shi's friend, Xu Fengxiang, threatened her at night with a sharp knife and raped her. She was repeatedly raped afterward, and Xu hid her in his house in Xujiahui. His wife objected, leading to an argument. Xu Fengxiang then beat his wife severely, leading to his arrest by the police and</p>
<p>brought before the court, where he was found guilty and sentenced to four months in prison. She was then sent to the Women and Children Relief Association, etc. Cai Xitang, having heard all this, believed that Shi and Xu, having both abducted a good woman and forcibly raped a virgin, were guilty of unforgivable crimes. He therefore hired lawyer Yan Hongxi to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing Shi and Xu of violating Articles 240 and 257 of the Criminal Law, and reserving his rights to civil litigation, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Division of the Special Court conducted a preliminary hearing. The plaintiff, Cai Xitang, along with his daughter Ni Mingzhu and their attorney, appeared in court and stated the circumstances of the abduction. Judge Feng</p>
<p>ordered a postponement for further investigation, as the case required further investigation. It is reported that the defendant, Shi Huibin, has also been arrested by Qidong County.</p>
<h3>More Than 770,000 Visitors to the Parks of the Shanghai Municipal Council in July</h3>
<p>The Parks Management Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council reported that in July, work had begun on widening the path connecting Hongkou Park and the zoo.

<h3>The Yellow River Water Level Exceeded the 20-Year Flood Level</h3>
<p>丨Emergency Efforts Underway to Reinforce the Endangered Dikes丨</p>
<p>The Engineering Department of the National Economic Council received a telegram yesterday from the Henan Provincial Works Bureau stating that the river water in Mengjin County had risen sharply, exceeding the 20-year flood level. Except for the already completed dikes and the more than 1,000 meters of new dikes protecting the east and west of Tieshe Town, which can be guaranteed to be safe, the water is fierce and dangerous in all other places. The Bureau has been repeatedly ordered to assist the local government in flood control, so it has supervised more than 300 workers to protect the dike in sections within the planned dike line, and built small earthen ridges on the upstream Niuzhuangzui to prevent water from invading the dike line. In addition, a culvert is being built in the northeast corner of Tieshe Town, and the water is rushing</p>
<p>west of the Dawang Temple, which is extremely dangerous. After throwing hemp bags and stones, and doing our best to protect it, fortunately there was no accident. The old dikes 234 downstream of the Dawang Temple were all flooded, and the areas of Dongxiang Garden, Xiaoji, and Kouma were heavily affected. Personnel have been sent to investigate.

<p>passed, there is still much to worry about in the autumn flood season.

<h3>French Police's Case Against Englishman Qiu Da</h3>
<p>English Lawyer Argued Logically</p>
<p>Magistrate Agreed with the Theory</p>
<p>Defendant Was Fined to Settle the Case</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that the French Concession police accused Englishman Qiu Da of driving a car without the rear lights on, violating the traffic regulations of the French Concession. After Magistrate Haines of the English Police Court ordered the French police to first submit evidence that the regulations had been approved by the English authorities, a tense mood arose among the foreigners in this port, and the French authorities also studied retaliatory measures and hired English lawyer Blue Elde as their representative. At the continued hearing this morning (the 11th), Blue argued, based on the initial land regulations and laws that established the French Concession and granted ordinary police powers to the French Consul General, that these regulations had been approved by the envoys of various countries in 1869, and that the envoys were included in it, and that this approval could automatically apply to subsequent traffic regulations. Magistrate Haines agreed with this theory and fined Qiu Da five shillings, and the traffic regulation issue that had caused a stir among foreigners was thus resolved.</p>

<h3>Draft Rural Reconstruction Plan of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs (Continued)</h3>
<p>Second Reconstruction Plan</p>
<p>After the rural areas receive relief and return to normal, and the farmers live and work in peace and contentment, then planning for reconstruction will be met with the farmers' joyful expressions and willingness to engage. This will achieve twice the result with half the effort, and it will be easy to achieve success. For the reconstruction of rural finance, to revive rural finance, the following should be done: ㈠ Increase rural industries to enrich farmers' economic income, ㈡ Promote rural organizations, develop cooperative undertakings, and reduce rural consumption in rural areas, ㈢ Organize farmers' banks and establish agricultural warehousing businesses to facilitate the circulation of rural finance. The details are as follows: (A) General Enhancement of Rural Areas, Operating Agriculture</p>
<p>For those engaged in agriculture, namely the farmers, to achieve the increase of rural industry, the first important thing is to make the</p>
<p>farmers receive appropriate education and have adequate knowledge, and then for agricultural matters, or</p>
<p>other businesses related to agricultural matters, improvement and development can be sought.</p>
<p>In this city, schools are abundant in various parts of the city, and it is easier for children to enter schools, so literacy</p>
<p>people are also relatively numerous. However, in rural areas, schools are very few, and the number of farm children</p>
<p>who can enter school is less than one in ten. In the future, if we want to enable these future farmers to develop agriculture and increase agricultural production, it will be very difficult. Therefore, rural primary schools should be established in appropriate locations in various rural areas to popularize farmers' education. Secondly, efforts should be made to increase the yield of agricultural crops. There are various ways to increase the yield of agricultural crops. (To be continued)</p>

<p>established and have achieved considerable results, which have attracted attention from all parties. Recently, Yao Huiquan, Director of the Rural</p>

<h3>Recent News of Private Guangming Primary School</h3>
<p>Private Guangming Primary School and Kindergarten was founded by teachers from various middle schools in Shanghai and a large</p>
<p>number of experts engaged in primary and kindergarten education.

The environment is quiet and the transportation is convenient. Enrollment of new male and female</p>
<p>students has now begun.</p>

<p>Shanghai-Tianjin Intercity Tennis, the First Day</p>
<h3>Zheng Zhaojia's Fierce Battle with Lun Qiang Unfinished</h3>
<p>▲Zheng Lost the First Set but Won Two Consecutive Sets, Play Resumed Today Due to Darkness</p>
<p>▲Qiu Feihai vs. Jie Hansheng Today, a Total of Three Matches</p>
<p>The Tianjin-Shanghai Intercity Tennis Tournament opened at the French Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon. Shanghai was represented by Zheng Zhaojia, who replaced Jiang Daozhang, in a match against Tianjin's Da Lunqiang. There were few spectators. The match was originally scheduled to start at 4:30 PM, but as the two were practicing on the court, preparing to begin, dark clouds suddenly gathered and a heavy rain began, which lasted for a quarter of an hour. The grass court manager immediately ordered workers to wipe the grandstand dry with towels and wipe the tarpaulin on the court dry. The match started more than five hours later. Zheng Zhaojia carelessly lost the first set, but then won two consecutive sets. Because it was getting dark, the match was not continued and was rescheduled to continue before 3:00 PM today. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia (Shanghai) 2 丨 6 6 丨 3 6 丨 1 (Unfinished) Da Lunqiang (Tianjin)</p>
<p>▲Competitive Situation Da Lunqiang is a small "big guy" who specializes in using chop shots, which are extremely soft and sticky. Zheng Zhaojia still used his sharp draw shots to counterattack, but the chop shots were not effective against the draw shots. The ball often touched the net and died, causing Zheng great embarrassment. After testing this set, Zheng changed his strategy, using soft balls to return the shots, focusing on the boundaries, and going to the net, making Da Lunqiang run east and west, exhausted. Zheng, on the other hand, commanded with ease, winning</p>
<p>much applause from the audience.</p>
<p>[丨&gt;Tianjin Intercity Tennis Team (Photo by Li Zunyong)&lt;丨]</p>
<p>▲Carelessly Lost the Start When the battle began, Lun Qiang served and won a game. When Zheng Zhaojia served, the linesman called "foot fault" twice in a row, causing Zheng to become cautious and affecting his use of his intellect, which was very unfavorable. In fact, Zheng's serve had no defect of "foot fault," and it was merely the linesman's nitpicking. After Zheng took back Lun Qiang's serve, he lost two more games in a row, making it 1 to 4. The biggest reason was that Zheng was not used to the opponent's sharp chop shots and felt unable to do what he wanted. Zheng lost the first set with a score of 1 to 6.</p>
<p>▲Soft Skill Conquers Starting from the second set, Zheng used extremely low balls to sweep the boundaries, one left and one right. Lun Qiang was troubled by running after the ball and lost two games in a row. But then Zheng lost three more games in a row. Zheng proceeded cautiously, using the superb skill of a rubber band to put the opponent in a difficult position. There were very few mistakes, and he could command as he pleased, making Lun Qiang pant like a cow and quench his thirst with ice water from time to time. Zheng, on the other hand, was as calm as usual and not in a hurry at all. As a result of this set, Zheng won 6 to 3.</p>
<p>▲Everything Went Smoothly When the third set began, Zheng Zhaojia became more and more</p>
<p>successful. His serves, which were as heavy as cannonballs, also had no mistakes. He was truly doing whatever he wanted and was invincible. Although Lun Qiang also attacked both sides, Zheng had already seen through the opponent's plan, so he ran and dealt with it appropriately, and his steps were neat. Seeing that his plan was not working, Lun Qiang became more and more anxious. Zheng won five games in a row very easily. The third and fourth games were both slippery fours, and the sixth game was won by Lun Qiang.</p>
<p>The seventh game was again Zheng, and Zheng won 6 to 1. At this time, it was already dark and the game could not be finished. The remaining game will continue today.</p>
<p>▲Today's Order There were originally two matches scheduled to start at 3:00 PM today, one singles and one doubles. Because the match between Zheng Zhaojia and Lun Qiang yesterday was not finished, it will continue at 2:00 PM today, so there are a total of three matches. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia (Shanghai) vs. Da Lunqiang (Tianjin) Starting at 2:00 PM</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai (Shanghai) vs. Jie Hansheng (Tianjin) Starting at 3:00 PM</p>
<p>Stocker &amp; Schuar (Shanghai) vs. Hewitt &amp; Faber (Tianjin) Starting at 4:30 PM</p>

<p>The Ministry of Railways Offers Preferential Treatment to the National Games</p>
<h3>Player and Staff Regulations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 11th) The Ministry of Railways has approved the Ministry of Education's request to follow established precedents in reducing or exempting the transportation costs for staff, athletes, and referees participating in this year's National Games, as a gesture of general preferential treatment. It has been approved to proceed according to the transportation regulations established for the National Games in the 20th year of the Republic. However, to ensure particular caution and to prevent excessive congestion on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway at that time, the following limitations have been added: 1. According to item 6 of the Ministry's regulations on preferential treatment for members of academic organizations attending annual meetings, in addition to not being allowed to ride special express trains on any route, it is also not applicable to any passenger trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway on Saturdays and Sundays. 2. The validity period printed on the back of both types of travel passes shall be uniformly set as one month prior and fifteen days after the event, from September 11th to October 25th. 3. All two types of travel passes, after being stamped by the National Games Organizing Committee, must be sent to the Ministry for an additional stamp to be valid. Furthermore, these passes are only valid for a single one-way trip, regardless of the route taken. If a sleeping berth is occupied, a full-price ticket must be purchased. The Ministry of Railways has responded to the National Games' request by agreeing to have the Shanghai-bound express train from Nanjing make a temporary stop at Taipingmen Station every afternoon during the Games to provide convenience.</p>

<h3>YMCA Open Swimming</h3>
<p>▲ Very Enthusiastic Registration</p>
<p>The open swimming competition organized by the Chinese YMCA on Szechuan Road in this city will be held on the 19th of this month at the YMCA swimming pool. As previously reported in this newspaper, registration has been very enthusiastic. However, some seasoned swimmers have not yet registered to participate. There are only five days left until the registration deadline. Anyone with such skills and interests, regardless of gender or age, may register at the YMCA's Sports Department.

<h3>Zhu Tianzhen May Still Represent Shandong Province at the National Games</h3>
<p>The standards set for this Shandong selection of athletes to participate in the National Games are higher than those for the North China Games. The number of athletes selected will likely not be very large. Judging from the province's strength, male athletes have very little hope. Only the women's division may be able to compete with Shanghai and Guangdong. Shandong's female athletes, such as Yu Xiulan, Tong Zhiying, and Yin Sugui, are all working hard in practice. Jumping Queen Zhu Tianzhen, after participating in the North China Games from Qingdao, went to Nanjing to apply for the physical education department of Central University. According to her recent letter, the exams have been completed, but the results have not yet been released. She said she will return to Jinan soon. Today, the pre-selection committee decided that "track and field athletes will be limited to those who have participated in the 17th North China Games." Therefore, Zhu Tianzhen may still be able to represent Shandong in the National Games.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Shanghai West Race Walking Team</h3>
<p>▲ Team Meeting to be Held on the 13th</p>

In the previous Chinese Open Race Walking Competition, the team won the championship and runner-up positions, as well as the National Sports Championship. Its strength is truly commendable in Shanghai. Although a few team members have been unable to practice due to work commitments this year, their overall strength has not diminished significantly. Athletes such as Zhang Jiu, Lu Wenxia, Lu Chongyi, and Ge Jinwen are still active. As the third Chinese Open Race Walking Competition in Shanghai is about to be held, the team, in order to prepare in advance, has scheduled its sixth general team meeting for 10:30 AM on the 13th of this month (Sunday) to discuss all relevant matters. All team members are required to attend on time.</p>

This has been officially recognized by the International Swimming Club as a new world record.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the City No. 1 Sports Field Team Table Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>Registration for the City No. 1 Sports Field Team Table Tennis Tournament has been open for several days, and many teams have already registered. Registration will close on the 20th of this month, and late entries will not be accepted. It is reported that after the team competition is completed, the individual table tennis competition will continue. The method will be to divide the players into multiple groups according to their skill level, so that each player can have a comparable opponent and have a chance to win. This is similar to the amateur tennis tournament. The skill level of each player will be determined based on the results of previous team competitions. Therefore, those who wish to participate in the individual competition should participate in the team competition.</p>

<h3>Tuning Method and Steps for Shortwave Transmitters</h3>
<p>— Luo Jingyu</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>Since "shortwave" has conquered today's universe, the trend in wireless transmitters, regardless of power or whether they are for transportation or amateur research, has largely shifted in this direction. Everywhere we look, shortwave transmitters are shouldering the communication work of humankind. However, among us users, apart from engineers or designated technicians, the tuning methods and steps for transmitters are largely overlooked. This is not only a small shortcoming in our knowledge but sometimes can even be called unfortunate. The author had a friend who was proficient in Morse code and fighting the enemy on the front lines in Kailu, outside the customs, who lost his life because of this shortcoming!</p>
<p>From an application perspective, transmitters today can generally be divided into two major categories: first, single-oscillation (Self Oscillation), and second, multiple-oscillation (Master Oscillation). A single-oscillation transmitter uses one or two vacuum tubes to generate oscillation and directly inputs this oscillating current into the antenna. However, its frequency is not very stable. Especially for high-power and long-distance transmission, the vacuum tubes themselves have to be made larger, which inevitably leads to changes in internal capacitance that are difficult to prevent and reduce. Its transmission work is also limited to manual operation and cannot use high-speed machines. However, due to its convenience and the fact that it does not cause significant problems in low-power and short-distance communication, this type is still popularly used today. A multiple-oscillation transmitter uses a smaller vacuum tube to generate oscillation, which then passes through an amplifier and a frequency multiplier (Touber of Frequency) before the oscillating current is input into the antenna. The purpose is to stabilize the frequency and facilitate the use of high-speed machines for transmission. Today, the Zhenru International Radio Station and others use this type.</p>
<p>Usually, our explanation of the purpose of tuning refers to transmission efficiency. Any circuit structure inevitably has inherent losses. However, we want to relatively reduce these inherent losses in any circuit. Or, we input a certain value of power, but we want to obtain the maximum output. In fact, we can determine this efficiency discrimination by looking at the ratio between the milliammeter on the vacuum tube's plate and the ammeter on the antenna. If the number on the plate is smaller and the number on the antenna is larger, then we have successful tuning and satisfactory tuning. Here is a formula: Let E be efficiency, Pi be input electrical energy, P0 be output electrical energy, and P1 be lost electrical energy. Then</p>
<p>E = P0 / Pi = P0 / (Pi + P1)</p>
<p>Therefore, to increase efficiency, the number of P0 in the formula must be increased. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Shortwave Radio Knowledge</h3>
<p>— RF Translated</p>
<p>Rotate the tuning dial as slowly as possible.</p>
<p>When a weak signal is adjusted (such as a hissing sound), it should be carefully adjusted. The result is often a very clear broadcast.</p>
<p>Do not assume that radio reception is best at night. Shortwave broadcasts can often be received satisfactorily at any time of the day or night.</p>
<p>Long-distance stations with wavelengths above 50 meters are not easy to receive.</p>
<p>It is extremely difficult to receive long-distance broadcasts with wavelengths above 33 meters during the day. Therefore, it is not necessary to labor in vain adjusting the section above 33 meters on the dial during the day. (Local stations are, of course, an exception.)</p>
<p>It is extremely difficult to receive long-distance broadcasts with wavelengths below 25 meters at night. Therefore, it is not necessary to waste effort adjusting the section below 25 meters on the dial at night. (Local stations are, of course, an exception.)</p>
<p>To receive long-distance broadcasts, you should first know if the station is broadcasting at that time and its approximate location on the dial, and then listen carefully.</p>
<p>On the first day you get a shortwave radio, do not expect to receive long-distance broadcasts, because satisfactory reception requires considerable tuning skills. Do not be disappointed with your radio if today's reception is poor. It may not be working well today, but tomorrow's performance may be excellent.</p>
<p>After you are familiar with the tuning methods, you can receive broadcasts from many stations.</p>
<p>If you have used all the above methods and cannot get satisfactory reception, then the radio is not good and should be modified.</p>
<h3>British Metal Vacuum Tubes</h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>American radio vacuum tube manufacturers are racking their brains to increase the number of grids within the tube, from triodes and tetrodes to pentodes and hexodes. Recently, even heptodes have appeared, and future octodes and nonodes are on the horizon. The speed of new models being released has increased to hundreds in the past year, leaving people speechless. However, because we rarely have the opportunity to come into contact with British vacuum tubes, few people are familiar with their development. The most significant improvement in British vacuum tubes is the effort to reduce the glass components. Recently, all-metal vacuum tubes have been introduced, which solves many of the problems with vacuum tubes.</p>
<p>The structure of a metal vacuum tube can be briefly described as follows: a copper tube replaces the ordinary glass tube. This copper tube serves as the vacuum tube's plate. The other grids and cathode are all installed inside this copper tube, and their relative positions are the same as in ordinary vacuum tubes. The bottom of this copper tube [丨&gt; Plate Connector Grille Shield Control Grid Plate Glass Seal &lt;丨]</p>
<p>is sealed with a very short glass section. The air inside the tube is drawn out from here to create a very dense vacuum. The connections for each electrode are also led out through this glass section. The entire bottom of the vacuum tube is mounted on a circular rubber base.</p>
<p>This type of vacuum tube construction has been used for high-power transmitters in the UK for several years. Its use in receivers is still a recent innovation. Because the plate of a transmitting vacuum tube dissipates a lot of power, it must be equipped with a water jacket for cooling. This new type of metal vacuum tube, because the plate is exposed to the outside, only requires air circulation to cool it sufficiently. The problem of heat radiation between the plate and the glass tube is solved.</p>
<p>This type of vacuum tube is much stronger than glass tubes because the electrodes inside the tube can be tightly clamped at both ends of the tube using insulating spacers. These spacers are also tightly attached to the inner layer of the plate tube, so the distance between the electrodes is very consistent and not easily changed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the characteristics of each tube are completely the same. The manufacturer has stated that there is very little risk of damage if this tube is dropped from a height of six feet onto a cement floor.</p>
<p>This type of vacuum tube, when used for general purpose and high-power output, does not have a separate shield. The exposed plate makes the cooling effect more apparent. When used for high-frequency amplification, the shield is the same size as the base and is tightly attached to the base, unlike American vacuum tubes, which require a separate shield.</p>
<h3>How to Adjust the Lowest Bass</h3>
<p>— Guan Zhibing</p>
<p>The Chinese often do not pay much attention to the problem of adjusting the tone. It is not that they are unwilling to pay attention, but that Chinese music is fundamentally too monotonous. When using the high frequencies, there is little mixing with the middle and low frequencies. It can be said that it is almost nonexistent. Because of this reason, the broadcasts of general broadcasting stations only seek to make the Chinese records clear. Even if two Western music records are added, it will not be felt that they are not completely broadcast. People who are accustomed to Chinese music, even foreigners, do not notice it at first. In fact, the lowest bass is often cut off unheard without them realizing it.</p>
<p>Even three months ago, the Western radio stations in Shanghai did not pay attention to this point. The common problem was that they amplified the high frequencies and cut off the lowest bass. Since the 580 kilocycle ZMHY Western radio station appeared in Shanghai, broadcasting beautiful and pleasant low-frequency tones, it has won the praise and support of a wide audience. Therefore, all Western radio stations were very surprised and felt that their past adjustments were not appropriate. They actively brainstormed and devoted themselves to this point. After re-analyzing the adjustments, some achieved considerable results, while others continued to search.</p>
<p>We know that the quality of a radio station naturally depends on the quality of the transmitter because it is like a gateway. If the gateway is not good, it is impossible to emit a good sound. But this is only part of the reason. The low-frequency amplifier in a radio broadcasting machine is like a throat. The tone emitted from a damaged throat will also be broken and unbearable to listen to. Therefore, I think the low-frequency amplifier is the most important and cannot be ignored. Regarding this point, I will write down the criticism of the Shanghai Western radio stations by the Ministry of Communications and the different comments of the general audience below, so that it can be understood that the low-frequency amplifier is also very important.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' evaluation: The best of the Western radio stations is the 1300 kilocycle XCBL, while the 580 kilocycle ZMHY is ranked fourth. However, the general audience believes that ZMHY ranks first among Chinese and Western radio stations, while XCBL ranks last among Western radio stations. What is the reason for this? It is not that the Ministry of Communications' verification is inappropriate, but that the Ministry of Communications does not care about the quality of the tone, only seeking to ensure that the transmission part does not affect others as a principle. The general audience does not care about affecting others or not, only seeking clear or unclear sound. Therefore, the two are inconsistent. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Research on Vacuum Tube-Less Radios (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Among these many experts, there was a famous Dr. Bruce Morgen. He was a British physicist who came to help Mr. Burke as his consultant. After experimenting with this vacuum tube-less radio, he made the following statement:</p>
<p>"Mr. Burke has invented a way to receive radio broadcasts without vacuum tubes or any kind of lamp. This is truly the most valuable contribution to radio science and radio listeners. If this great new invention can be implemented in the near future, we can save $69 million a year in the cost of purchasing vacuum tubes. And from my experiments, I have proven that Mr. Burke's new principle can save half of the power required by our ordinary radios. Because this type of radio does not need to light filaments, you can immediately hear the broadcast when you turn the dial. As long as you turn the dial, you can receive the station you need without any delay or any weakening of the sound. And we can imagine that because this type of radio does not need vacuum tubes, all the noise, strange noises, and other sounds in our radios can be extremely avoided, resulting in a natural, gentle, and wonderful sound. Such an economical and satisfactory vacuum tube-less radio will naturally have very wide applications in the future. And it can also increase the enjoyment of our radio listeners a lot." (The End)</p>
<p>Small Experiences</p>
<h3>Manufacturing of Lamp Base Substitutes for Shortwave Coil Holders</h3>
<p>— Hua Yu</p>
<p>Buy a bakelite tube with a diameter of one and a quarter inches to prepare for winding the wire. The length should depend on the number of turns to be wound. Then, use a compass to draw a circle on a wooden board about half an inch thick that is the same diameter as the bakelite tube. Then, punch four holes in the same position as a normal light socket, as shown in Figure 1. Insert a copper tube (about one inch long) used in transmitters that is the same size as a normal light socket into each of the larger holes. Then, place the prepared bakelite tube on the wooden board and fill it with melted sealing wax, as shown in Figure 2. After it has cooled and solidified, remove the wooden board to form a shortwave coil holder. If the sealing wax on the bottom surface is not flat, it can be smoothed with a file. This method produces a coil holder that is both beautiful and economical, and the number of copper feet and the length of the bakelite tube are not limited as they would be when using an old lamp base.</p>

<h3>Two Experiences in Making Transformers</h3>
<p>— Zhang Guoquan</p>
<p>When making transformers, the paper core is often not strong enough, and the wound wire is often easily loosened. This is very unfortunate. If, before winding the wire, two thin strips of white cloth are first filled in and then wrapped with insulating paper or cloth, after winding, tie it tightly in a knot, and it will not loosen.</p>
<p>When inserting silicon steel sheets, it is common to break the paper core, and unfortunately, the wire may even be broken. The preventative method is to insert two iron sheets that are slightly longer than the paper core before inserting the silicon steel sheets and place them on both the left and right sides of the silicon steel sheets. Bend the exposed ends. In this way, you don't have to worry when inserting silicon steel sheets.</p>
<h3>Inside and Outside News</h3>
<p>▲ Ewes New Machine Arrives in Shanghai. Ewes radios are made entirely in the United States and are definitely not comparable to those made in Japan and shipped to Shanghai. The price is also particularly modest. New goods have now arrived. Those who do not have radios are invited to try one.</p>
<p>▲ Stewart Invites Outport Managers. The well-known American brand Stewart Radios are exclusively managed by the Shanghai Meichang Foreign Company, and sales are quite extensive. Currently, for the purpose of business in other cities, the company is inviting branch managers for Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Shandong, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places. Those interested can send a letter directly to the Meichang Foreign Company at 417 Foch Road, Shanghai, to negotiate.</p>
<h3>Announcements from this Publication</h3>
<p>Is your radio damaged? Does it need to be inspected and repaired? If you lack the basic knowledge of repairing radios, please do not attempt to disassemble and repair it yourself. This could further damage the important parts of the radio. Also, do not rashly send it to an unfamiliar repair shop for repair. Repair shops often charge exorbitant prices, claiming that parts need to be completely replaced even when the damage inside the radio is not significant, thus increasing the repair costs. There are many radio repair shops in Shanghai, such as the Dahua Radio Company, the Zhonghua Radio Research Institute, the Jianhua Electrical Materials Company, as well as Xin Ya, Yasheng, Yada, Yamei, and others, all of which have great reputations and are highly trusted. This publication is happy to introduce them. However, to better serve our readers, this publication has recently made a special arrangement with Kang Mao Radio Shop at 47 Ningbo Road to set up a free inspection department. Readers of this newspaper who have radios that are unfortunately damaged can cut out this notice and send the radio to the shop for inspection. The inspection department will then clearly indicate the location of the damage and estimate the repair costs. The inspection is completely free. Kang Mao Radio Shop already has a repair department, but it specializes in repairing Yousiai and Stewards radios, which are managed by the shop. For other brands of radios, they will be introduced to the most suitable repair shops, ensuring that readers have somewhere appropriate to go and do not suffer losses. This is truly the intention of this publication to serve its readers, and it has been agreed upon by Kang Mao Radio Shop. We hope everyone will pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>### Credo of Love</h3>
<p>— Thin Gull</p>
<p>When I was around twenty years old, the so-called young whippersnapper era, the study and discussion of love problems was truly an unparalleled pleasure; often gathering with several classmates, burning the midnight oil, talking until the listeners were moved and the speakers forgot their weariness, willing to be unable to get up the next day and skipping school. It seemed that if we didn't discuss it so diligently, we would never be able to marry a wife. Looking back now, I am simply so ashamed that even my neck turns red.</p>
<p>But just the day before yesterday, I unintentionally ran into two young people who were treating love as their main meal. They knew that I had written a novella about love in the supplement of this newspaper! "To a Friend's Wife," they thought I was a love expert and immediately began to question me on the spot. I initially declined politely, but couldn't resist their repeated requests, and finally had to utter the following nonsense.</p>
<p>I said: If you want to study true love and thorough love, the first thing you must understand is the credo of love. What is the credo of love? It is "sacrifice." Under any circumstances, when you begin to love someone of the opposite sex, you must be prepared to make all sacrifices: not only can you not hold any isms, but you also cannot regard marriage or obtaining the other party's sympathy as the highest goal. If you only regard marriage as the highest goal of your love, then it cannot be said to be love, only the advancement of your plan to raise children. As for whether the other party can accept your love, whether they can express sympathy, you absolutely should not take it too seriously. You only need to ask yourself whether you can completely pour all your passion into the other person, and the essence of love is exhausted.</p>
<p>After they heard my little high-level argument, probably because I spoke too uniquely, they vaguely agreed. Of course, I was also very proud. Everyone then parted happily. But later, when I thought about it carefully, I couldn't help but feel guilty. If all the infatuated men and women in the world followed the credo I set, two phenomena would definitely occur: one would be widespread unrequited love, and the other would be the Huangpu River hanging a full sign. However, this is purely from a pessimistic perspective. If we think from an optimistic perspective, we can also say that because your love is so sincere and earnest, it will be particularly easy to arouse the other person's sympathy and achieve a happy union. Done, I've said it all from both sides! But whether it is ultimately true or false, it still has to be left to public opinion.</p>
<h3>### Shasha Water</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>In the lower classes, in the inland villages where everything is backward, although they know that the "picking sha" of the barber-cum-servant is somewhat unreliable, they also have a three-part "fear" and seven-part "distrust" of the "foreign hospital's" emergency treatment of epidemics. Therefore, they regard the "Shasha Water" prepared by general "benevolent and world-saving", both profitable and compassionate "scientific experts" as the only life-saving Bodhisattva. For a slight headache, take "Shasha Water," for vomiting and diarrhea, also take "Shasha Water," when the hands and feet are cold, still pry open the teeth and pour "Shasha Water." It is said that "Shasha Water's" "disaster relief and longevity," "bringing the dead back to life," is ten thousand times more effective than burning long ingots and eating incense ash.</p>
<p>Whether "Shasha Water" has absolute efficacy for all kinds of epidemics, regardless of severity, I am not very clear. But judging from the many kinds of "Shasha Water" on the market and the wide sales, "Shasha Water" may not be able to snatch the soul from the Palace of Yama from a body whose blood has been completely destroyed by cholera bacteria, but it may have some effect on quasi-cholera diseases that would not have been fatal in the first place. It is like a couple arguing over pinching a thigh, and naturally they will reconcile after being persuaded by someone. If it is because the "husband takes a concubine" or the "wife commits adultery," then the peacemaker's lips and tongue are exhausted in vain. The effectiveness of "Shasha Water," I think, is about the same as that of this peacemaker.</p>
<p>Because of "Shasha Water," I think of the most popular "meetings" these days. Small ones, such as resolving the jealousy between big and small wives, the "family meeting," where the big wife and the small wife can exchange opinions and propose conditions. Large ones, such as maintaining world peace and stabilizing world finance, the "international conference," where everyone can also express opinions and negotiate conditions. So these "meetings" are also very much like "Shasha Water." People with Sha, taking "Shasha Water," feel their spirits lifted and the illness is cured. If taking ten drops is still ineffective, then twenty drops, thirty drops. If "Guanyin Shasha Water" is ineffective, then take "Jidian Shasha Water." So if the "first meeting" is unsuccessful, then hold the "second" and "third meetings." If the "Arctic Ocean Conference" is unsuccessful, then change to the "Antarctic Ocean Conference." Even if the meeting is opened to the point where everyone's mouths are closed, they still have to pry open their teeth and pour "Shasha Water."</p>

<h3>### Feelings in the Carriageway</h3>
<p>One car pulls me, one person runs. The red sun is like boiling soup, the ground is noisy. Very thirsty, I rush to drink halfway, hungry, I beg for a few mouthfuls but there is no door. Sweat can truly be seen becoming scorched, the snow also teaches to chase away the cold warmth. The passenger is unkind and often scolds, pity him that the gold is exhausted, what can be said!</p>
<h3>### Discussing Recent Chinese Women with a Friend</h3>
<p>Loving and greedy, carrying too much, failing the spring. In the future, alone in the dark room, one will be saddened. Emotionally entangled with "desire," ultimately becoming a mistake, intent on "self-restraint," turning into losing the truth. Pregnancy urging each other, startled by old age, relatives gradually exhausted, sighing and falling. At the intersection of "two yuan" theories, how many sunflower girls are there with fluttering banners?</p>

<h3>### Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Abandoning One's Post to See a Soulmate, the Beautiful Woman Tacitly Agrees.</p>
<p>Those Who Inherit Their Family are Hooligans Rejoicing.</p>
<p>Guan Yaowu began: What's not the way to say it like that, I see it's completely because of this relationship. Did the Yang family say anything they didn't want? Zhao Ziqiang said: He said he didn't say it, but in between the lines, it seemed like he was saying that he was betrothing the girl to a soldier, but that was... He smiled as he said: I can't say. Their meaning is that they are afraid of delaying the girl's youth. Guan Yaowu waved his hand and said: You don't need to say it, I understand. This matter is all my fault for being lazy and not saying a word, almost stiffening things up. Today, let's drink two cups with peace of mind first, and tomorrow I'll go to the Yang family to talk about it. If he's willing to give her to someone who carries a gun, that would be a thousand times good. If he doesn't agree, we have to ask him, if you don't carry a gun, will he still give her to you? If you resign here and he still doesn't give her to you, that would be a double loss. Zhao Ziqiang said: Actually, I'm not doing this for this. Guan Yaowu laughed and said: Alright! You're a bit of a lecher. Still saying these things in front of me. Don't rush, I'll slowly reconcile you. Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said: What am I rushing for? I don't have to rush! As he said this, he picked up his cup and took two sips of wine. Guan Yaowu could see his situation very clearly, and earnestly comforted him. After finishing the wine, Zhao Ziqiang paid for the wine himself. When he was taking money out of his wallet, he happened to take out a pawn ticket. Guan Yaowu said: Oh! Lao Zhao, are you running a deficit? Zhao Ziqiang said: Last year, during the Chinese New Year, I couldn't get by, so I pawned two leather coats that I didn't wear at home. Anyway, they're useless, so I pawned them. As they were talking, the waiter came to collect the money. Zhao Ziqiang waved the pawn ticket and said: Did you see that? If I get paid, there's still this. The waiter smiled and said: These are unwanted clothes, just put them away for him. If you don't have money, are you still planning to marry a wife? Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said: That's terrible, you heard everything we said. Guan Yaowu said: If you heard it, you heard it. Marrying a wife is not something you can't tell people. (156)</p>

<h3>### A Piece of Cloth with Magical Changes</h3>
<p>— Pei Ying</p>
<p>Old Mother Peikel was in her little house covered in white snow, tidying up, busying herself. She was doing this work of wiping tables and chairs, washing utensils, etc., for her own happiness and her own life.</p>
<p>"Only that bowl rack needs to be wiped," she murmured, "After wiping the bowl rack, I can prepare to make a cake for a snack. I should eat this cake slowly, fearing that for a long time, there will be no other cake to fill my hunger."</p>
<p>Thud! Ta! Ta! Thud! Ta! Ta!</p>
<p>The old woman quickly went to the door, wiping her hands dry as she walked.</p>
<p>Standing at the door was a very interesting and funny little child, whose funny and interesting appearance you have never seen before. He wore a pair of long, pointed-toed shoes on his feet, and a green little hat on his head, tilted back on the back of his head. He looked like a thorough, well-versed prankster. Indeed, he was a very naughty child. He wore a huge empty basket on his shoulders, constantly spinning it interestingly. He sang:</p>
<p>"The bushel goes up! The bushel goes down.</p>
<p>Hand over a penny (Note 1)! Exchange it for a crown (Note 2)!"</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha!" He laughed so loudly after singing the last sentence: his laughter was truly like the sound coming from a kettle of boiling water.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Old Mother Peikel," he said very politely, taking off the hat on his head and bowing deeply. "I have walked as many leagues as the petals of a chrysanthemum. Please give me something to eat! I beg you! I am extremely hungry."</p>
<p>Old Mother Peikel remembered that she had a cake. This naughty child looked really very hungry, of course, she couldn't honestly tell him that there was only one cake left to fill her hunger.</p>
<p>How pitiful! How hungry he is! Look at his eyes, constantly turning, constantly dancing! Poor Old Mother Peikel! In an instant, even this last piece of cake was gone! (Children! Guess where the cake went?)</p>
<p>"The bushel goes up! The bushel goes down!</p>
<p>Hand over a penny! Exchange it for a crown!"</p>
<p>The little child put on his hat and prepared to leave, singing again.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Old Mother Peikel!" he shouted happily, while he greatly rotated the basket on his shoulder. Then he reached into the basket and took out a large piece of red cloth.</p>
<p>"Please accept it, because you are kind to others," he said, "If you need anything, just think of what you need, wave this piece of cloth, and you will get it. Good evening, goodbye!"</p>
<p>Old Mother Peikel went into the door and wiped the empty basins clean. She then spread a piece of white tablecloth on the table, and at this time she remembered that there was no cake left. Suddenly she saw the large piece of red cloth that the naughty child had given her, and remembered his instructions.</p>
<p>She picked up the piece of red cloth, closed her eyes, and wanted to have a crown to buy cake and other things. After thinking, she waved the cloth onto the table. Strange, there was indeed a radiant new crown! This was magic! Now she could have many, many things to eat.</p>
<p>Old Mother Peikel put the kettle of boiling water on the stove. Then she took her basket, took her bright new crown, went out the door, and walked to the small shop in the village to buy a cake and many other delicious things. When she came back, she heard the sound of singing in the kettle! Exactly the same as what the little child sang:</p>
<p>"The bushel goes up! The bushel goes down!</p>
<p>Hand over a penny! Exchange it for a crown!"</p>
<p>(Note 1: A penny is a British coin, formerly a copper coin, now made of bronze.)</p>
<p>(Note 2: A crown is a British coin worth five shillings.)</p>

<h3>### Talking About "Yellow Leaves"</h3>
<p>— Xiaoxue</p>
<p>"Yellow leaves" in poetry, "most evocative," old poets often liked to use them, and Su Shi's line "Living in a yellow-leaved village in Jiangnan" is even more praised. Wang Yuyang also felt particularly interested in this, and often included "yellow leaves" in his poems, such as "Many yellow leaves in the forest, many geese cries," "Mountain rain weeping late in the yellow leaves," which can all be said to be his memorable lines. Among today's writers, there are also many who love "yellow leaves." A few years ago, in the "General" magazine, I saw Zhong Jingwen's "Small Talk on Yellow Leaves," in which he talked about "red leaves" to "yellow leaves," and from "yellow leaves" to his own experiences, which was very touching. But after reading that article, we know that the illusion of the pastoral poet's life has been shattered; even the enjoyment of "yellow leaves" cannot be discussed apart from "reality." This year, I bought Li Rihua's "Purple Peach Pavilion Miscellany," "More Miscellany," and unintentionally saw a section discussing "yellow leaves" again, which reads:</p>
<p>"Yellow leaves" "fallen leaves" in poetry, most evocative. However, their origin is based on "Dongting starts to ripple, the leaves of trees are slightly shedding," and "Pavilion and highland leaves fall, autumn clouds fly over the Longshou." The Tang people clipped and trimmed them into the rhythm, with emotion. Such as: "Yellow leaves, trees of the former dynasty, no wind, cold palace opens." Also: "Yellow-leaved trees in the rain, white-haired people under the lamp." Also: "Autumn wind blows the Wei River, fallen leaves fill Chang'an." Also: "Opening the door, fallen leaves are deep." Also: "One leaf is also involved in falling." My Xijiang poem has the line:</p>
<p>"Empty mountain yellow leaves in the rain, shallow stream white sand flows." Also: "Cold mountain autumn chimes at the bottom, fallen leaves before the night lamp." Also: "Green mountain hermit's couch, yellow leaves old monk's home." Also, the title of the Yizui Pavilion of the Dafosi Temple in Wulin: "Stone opens yellow-leaved path, lake unfolds white gull sky." He claimed that the use of the word "leaf" was quite stable. When he was free, he took it out to consult with the Yellow-Leaf Monk, the monk savored it again and again, and smiled and said: "At first, I thought this thing was enough to stop children from crying, but I didn't expect it to be picked up by you and please people everywhere."</p>
<p>Li Rihua's works are now not easy to find, so I transcribe them here to tell those who love "yellow leaves." Chinese poets love "yellow leaves" so much. In Western Europe, you can also often see poems and articles about "yellow leaves." I remember a prose poem titled "Yellow Leaves," which wrote about a man giving "yellow leaves" to the woman he loved, and when he saw "yellow leaves" again in the second time, he remembered this matter. In China, "red leaves" are used to write poems, but I have never heard of using "yellow leaves." According to this prose poem, in Western Europe, "yellow leaves" can also "express feelings." Writing to this point, I opened Ishikawa Takuboku's complete works, which have titles such as "Smoke of Fallen Leaves," "Yellow Little Flowers," "Yellow Grass," and use "Yellow Grass Collection" as the general title of a part of the poems. The poet not only loves "yellow leaves," but also "yellow little flowers" and "yellow grass." Here, you can also get a "real proof."</p>
<h3>### Zero Feelings</h3>
<p>— Another Realm</p>
<p>Intellectuals are generally most prone to a fault, often mistaking a partial, temporary, or abnormal phenomenon as a representative of the whole, fundamental phenomenon.</p>
<p>For example, when someone talks about a third type of person, someone comes out to study the types of world writers, and even leads people to raise the banner of petty-bourgeois revolutionary literature, almost leading to the establishment of a "writers' type identification office" as written in "Ark and Humanity." As Mr. So-and-so said: "The human body has fat and thin, and in theory, there should be a third type of person who is neither fat nor thin, but in fact there is not. With comparison, one is either close to fat or close to thin." However, why do some people in China insist on shouting out "third type of person"? This is easy to understand, because in recent years, a certain ism in the country has developed to the point where people cannot breathe freely, and if they are careless, they will suffocate. If you want to take a deep breath openly, it is best to declare that you are the third type other than these two, so that neither side will offend him. In fact, this is only a temporary abnormal phenomenon, and there is no inherently third type of person.</p>
<p>Again, for example, everyone is advocating the popularization of culture, hoping to produce some popular books to provide the public with reading. In fact, inevitably, there will be crudely made and poorly written works, or, as a certain gentleman said, students who read ABC are considered to have a mastery of a certain subject. But if we, because of dissatisfaction with the current written works or the superficial mentality of the general students, resolutely say that books of preliminary knowledge are unnecessary, and that culture does not need to be popularized, wouldn't this be another big mistake!</p>
<p>Mistaking a partial, temporary, or abnormal phenomenon as a representative of the whole, fundamental phenomenon is indeed a fault that intellectuals are most prone to.</p>
<h3>Literary Criticism and the Novel</h3>
<p>— Zi Zhan</p>
<p>Liu Fu's collection of Dunhuang remnants, including works like "Han Peng Fu," "Yan Zi Fu," "Yan Zi Fu," and "Tea and Wine Discourse," categorized as novels, marks the beginning of incorporating rhymed prose into the novel genre. This is something that those studying bibliography must know, and literary scholars should pay particular attention to. I have previously argued that, apart from "Nine Arguments," the works attributed to Song Yu in the *Selections of Refined Literature* and *Anthology of Ancient Prose* are mostly forgeries by people of the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties periods. Moreover, I believe that these types of works, with their rich and engaging content, should be called novels rather than fu (rhymed prose). They are the forerunners of the Chinese novel. It is reasonable to say that rhymed prose novels developed before prose novels in the progression of literature, and there are clues to be found. Thirty years ago, popular literature from the Li Tang and Five Dynasties periods, discovered in the Dunhuang caves, included rhymed prose novels, such as those collected by Liu Fu in "Dunhuang Remnants." However, figures like Han Peng and Yan Zi were not like Song Yu, a historically famous author of fu, so no enthusiastic literati collected and revised their works, attributing them to Han Peng and Yan Zi. They were only able to circulate among the common people and be treated like novels. Yan Kejun's "Pre-Tang Prose" includes Liu Sizhen's "Ode to an Ugly Woman," which seems to be a rhymed prose novel circulating among the common people, like "Yan Zi Fu" and "Tea and Wine Discourse." Though likely incomplete, it is still highly valuable. Hu Shi's "History of Vernacular Literature" did not include it, likely because he had not seen it. It is recorded here:</p>
<p>Everyone obtains a fine wife,</p>
<p>Why is my fate uniquely to blame?</p>
<p>Not encountering Jiang Ren's virtue,</p>
<p>I met an ugly and wicked woman.</p>
<p>Her talent is base and frugal,</p>
<p>Her appearance worse than Mo Mu's.</p>
<p>Deer head and macaque face,</p>
<p>Protruding forehead and protruding mouth.</p>
<p>Sloping brow and loathsome high nose,</p>
<p>Two eyes that look like mortars.</p>
<p>Skin like old mulberry bark,</p>
<p>Ears like hands on either side.</p>
<p>Head like a rice-milling mallet,</p>
<p>Hair like a disheveled broom.</p>
<p>Loathsome appearance and displeasing countenance,</p>
<p>Not alluring like a door knocker.</p>
<p>Dull and clumsy at styling her hair,</p>
<p>Her makeup is even uglier.</p>
<p>Cheeks painted like a dog's lick,</p>
<p>Especially thick on the forehead.</p>
<p>Crimson lips like smeared blood,</p>
<p>Eyebrows drawn like a rat's burden.</p>
<p>Powder piled under her chin,</p>
<p>Not even on her face.</p>
<p>Neck like a salt-drum bag,</p>
<p>Sleeves like a pot-wiping cloth.</p>
<p>Her shoes are like treading in mud,</p>
<p>Her nails are long and filthy.</p>
<p>The cracks in her feet could hold chopsticks,</p>
<p>Looking at her makes one vomit.</p>
<p>Many of the words are incomprehensible, likely popular slang at the time, or perhaps miswritten characters. The author, Liu Sizhen, has no known place of origin or official position. There was a Liu Zhilin in the Liang Dynasty, courtesy name Sizhen. Could this be the same person? The "Biography of Yang Xiu Zhi" in the *History of the Northern Dynasties* recounts that his younger brother, Junzhi, wrote many six-character songs, licentious and clumsy, passed down among the people, known as "Yang Wu's Companions," which were written and sold endlessly in the market. Junzhi once passed by the market, took them, and corrected them, pointing out errors in the characters. The buyer said, "Yang Wu is an ancient worthy who created these 'Companions.' What do you know that you dare to criticize him lightly?" Junzhi was overjoyed. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, literature valued parallelism and elegance, but popular literature like "Yang Wu's Companions" and "Ode to an Ugly Woman" circulated among the common people. Hu Shi's "History of Vernacular Literature" missed this material, which is a loss.</p>
<h3>Dawn</h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>The chaotic and dreary life finally underwent a dramatic change. Although it wasn't entirely unexpected, the suddenness felt like a major blow to my life. Thus, for the sake of survival, I had to seek a new direction.</p>
<p>A vagrant-like friend became my companion. He led me into a different kind of life, characterized by youthful energy and vibrant vitality.</p>
<p>For three consecutive nights, without sleep, we spent our time in a photography studio, watching the lively young men and women reenact scenes of life. I seemed to forget all my pain. Talking, laughing, and joking with them made me aware that the flames of life were welling up from the depths of my heart.</p>
<p>After the performance, the intense photographic lights went out, and I began to feel tired and dull. Many of the actors gradually disappeared into the darkness, leaving only a few close friends. The atmosphere around us became quiet and desolate.</p>
<p>We sat together under the starry sky, conversing civilly. Although we occasionally touched on sad emotions, we would quickly laugh it off.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as if making a fresh discovery, a young woman pointed to the sky, clapped her hands, and cried out.</p>
<p>In the sky with its faintly glimmering stars, we saw a layer of fish-belly white rising. Dawn was about to arrive in this world.</p>
<p>For someone who has long been immersed in a dazed life, how many times have I failed to gaze at this beautiful dawn! The fragrant summer night air and the enchanting fish-belly-colored sky—how they would move your heart!</p>
<p>I felt as if I were sitting in a dreamscape, lifting my head to look at the sky, remembering many things I hadn't thought about for a long time. However, because of my state of mind at the time, I didn't comprehend the power of the dawn.</p>
<p>The dawn was still unable to dispel the shadow that covered my heart.</p>
<p>Drawn by friendship, on the fourth night, I had a train take me to Nanjing. An old friend, whom I had not seen in a long time and who was suffering from a long-term lung illness, greeted me with joy. And for the first time, I met his wife, a simple friend with no trace of calculation in her heart.</p>
<p>Besides his illness, my old friend was suffering from extreme economic hardship. The joy of our reunion did not last long. Mutual anxieties gradually turned our lives into silence. I was constantly worried about their health, and they were constantly worried about my uncertain future. Every night, when I heard my old friend's deep cough, my mood became particularly gloomy. Sometimes I even thought that, for his own sake and for the sake of those who loved him, wouldn't it be a happier thing if he could end his life sooner? I knew full well that this thought was tantamount to a sin, but I still couldn't help but think it often!</p>
<p>And so, life fell into an abyss of despair once more.</p>
<p>At this time, a healthy old friend with relatively better financial means rescued me. This friend, chubby and full of humor, never spoke of sentimental things, always making you happy. If he sat there blankly without laughing, I always felt like punching his fat leg. But if he were about to laugh, I couldn't help but want to hug him from behind without warning.</p>
<p>Most gratifying of all, he also had a wife, a woman known for her elegance and beauty. She treated me like a younger brother. I don't remember ever seeing her with an angry face; at least to me, she was always smiling. And seeing her smile was like drinking a glass of rich honey wine.</p>
<p>Perhaps humans are always selfish. I drew closer to them, and from them I not only felt warm affection, but it was also as if I were absorbing healthy blood.</p>
<p>Alone at night, sleeping on a canvas bed, the bed facing the window, the round moon shining on my face, I felt an indescribable peace in my heart. The painful coughing of my old friend could be temporarily unheard, and I fell asleep as soon as I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>When I woke up again, through the window I saw that enchanting fish-belly-colored sky again. The power of youth, the flames of life, surged in my chest.</p>
<h3>Ordinary Matters (37)</h3>
<p>— Jun Guo Sun</p>
<p>At this time, Zhi Guang had new concerns; he knew Bo Tang's current financial situation like the back of his hand. Last night's generosity in preparing to assist Zhabei was already something that Bo Tang was reluctantly doing, and today's use of funds to rescue Yong Sun was about to deplete Bo Tang's current cash reserves. Thus, these two matters could immediately place Bo Tang in dire straits. How many people in this world would willingly place themselves in such a predicament? And how many people in this world would openly advise others to place themselves in such a predicament? Of course, this involves a choice of priorities, and Bo Tang's choice, whether from an emotional or practical standpoint, could be predicted. As a result, the assistance plan would definitely be difficult to realize!</p>
<p>"Isn't this fate?" Zhi Guang pondered to himself. "What can we use to break fate?"</p>
<p>So he paced back and forth along the corridor again, forgetting not only that the weather was much clearer than yesterday, but also which direction the sounds of enemy planes and artillery were coming from!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of a car crunching on the gravel came from the gate. Zhi Guang quickly ran over to see Bo Tang stepping out of the car, accompanied by several representatives from the Changxing factory. Zhi Guang immediately sensed that the two matters of "assistance" and "rescue" would be decided within minutes.</p>
<p>However, when they all sat down together in the dining hall, the representatives said to Zhi Guang:</p>
<p>"Things are really unfortunate, Mr. Zhang! We can't really advocate for anything now, even though everyone knows about the call the owner made to us yesterday!"</p>
<p>"Alas!" Zhi Guang said. "Who says it isn't!"</p>
<p>"The boss already told us everything on the way here, so what else can we say at this point? However, we now hope to contribute a little to finding the old boss as quickly as possible. Then things will be easier!"</p>
<p>"Then things will be easier!" Zhi Guang echoed. Then he carefully explained the general account and the method for dealing with the Yong Sun incident. Then Representative Qiu said:</p>
<p>"At this point, we're just waiting for the two Mr. Yu to send the list of people to work with, and then we'll add some more workers and look for other methods."</p>
<p>By two o'clock, everything had been arranged except that there was still no news of Yong Sun: the funds for the preparations had arrived, the replacements had been found, and all the details related to the garrison had been separately handed over to the people in charge for execution. It seemed that things were becoming increasingly urgent. At this time, Bo Tang and many others were still sitting in the dining hall, but everyone's tongues seemed to be tied. No one could stir up any滔滔 unrestrained discussion. Occasionally, they exchanged three or five sentences, and then the conversation would end spontaneously. The atmosphere was very沉郁depressed, especially the furnishings in the dining hall, which seemed to add to the depressive mood. Everyone looked at their materials, colors, and lines, and felt no sense of stimulation. If it weren't for the almost constant ringing of the telephone in the hallway, or Uncle Jin's voice answering the phone, perhaps everyone would have dozed off long ago. Once, while Uncle Jin was clearing his throat and asking repeatedly on the phone, Pei Ying was reminded of the phone call she received that morning, urging her to "be sure to come to dinner tonight":</p>

<h3>Financial Futures Silver Special Price Drops, Gold Price Recovers to Eight Yuan and Six Jiao</h3>
<p>Powerful Players All Adopt a Wait-and-See Attitude</p>
<p>Entire Market Process Extremely Monotonous</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a general rise in British and American silver markets, a one-point rise in British-American exchange rates, a .125 decrease in American-British exchange rates, a decline of 0.17 to 0.3 percent in the price of forward silver on the Five Metals Exchange, a slight decline in American wheat, a one-yuan decline in stocks, a twenty-pound decline in American cotton, a private telegram silver price of a little over .1875, and rough trading that was expensive. After opening, the bank's appetite seemed to be supportive, and after entering, a slight dip was seen. There were few transactions in the market, and the fluctuations continued to be small. The situation was stable, struggling around 50 yuan. With the exchange market narrow, the gold market had difficulty experiencing prosperity or decline. The after-market was even calmer. The mood in the market was extremely boring, but the sentiment was slightly stable. The exchange market was initially loose but later tight. Bombay initially rose two annas and then fell one anna. Thus, the gold market situation was initially low and then high. Overall, the day was extremely mediocre, with only four yuan of fluctuations throughout the day. Large investors all adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The clam shell price remained at 190 yuan. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 849 yuan and 7 jiao, a 5.5 yuan rise from the previous close. Special goods opened at 9.8 jiao. The exchange market opening, with the near-term selling price calculated, was one shilling and three pence for the British exchange rate and 28 yuan and .125 for the American exchange rate. Heng Yu, Zhi Feng, Yong Da, De Cheng, Da Xing, and Yong Heng Tai jointly purchased. China-Belgium Bank and Mitsui both supported October for half a yuan. Although Taiwan blocked November American dollars at .625, it was still able to gradually rise to 51 yuan and 8 jiao. Trust &amp; Commerce sold November American dollars at .6875 to Zhong Fu and Zhejiang. Fu Yu, Yi Feng, Yong Zhao, and Feng Chang made slight supplies, retreating to 50 yuan. HSBC listed the British exchange rate as down .125 and the American exchange rate as down .25. Zhong Fu again supported November American dollars at .6875, struggling around one yuan. Subsequently, because November American dollars at .6875 became difficult to sell, Yuan Chun and Fu Chang sold at 49 yuan and 1 jiao. China-Belgium Bank took October American dollars at .75, goods moved forward and once rebounded to over 50 yuan but still declined. After a period of calm, Heng Yu entered the market to supply, and scattered shorts slightly pressed down, while Shanghai also blocked October American dollars at .5625, falling to 47 yuan and 8 jiao. Yi Feng, Yong Yuan, Feng Yong, Tian Feng, and Yong Che seized the opportunity to buy at low prices. The situation remained calm. China-Belgium Bank and MacKay further took November American dollars at .75, rebounding to 50 yuan and 3 jiao. Heng Xing came to sell, and although it saw a decline, it was ultimately lifted by Citibank taking November American dollars at .6875. Chun Yuan, Yong Fu, Yu Zhao, and Feng Chang bought slightly, causing it to rebound to .07 jiao. Heng Yu, Fu Chang, Da Xing Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, etc. all came to supply, dropping again to 48 yuan and 2 jiao. The noon close was 848 yuan and 6 jiao, with goods closing at 8.5 jiao.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 849 yuan and 1 jiao, with goods opening at 8.8 jiao. Heng Yu, Xie Xing, and Yong Ri Chang sold slightly, retreating from 9.3 jiao to 8 yuan, as Zheng Jin sold September American dollars at .375 to China-Belgium Bank. Fu Chang, Zhi Feng, Yong Zhao, and Feng Chang seized the opportunity to enter at low prices, gradually rising to over 9 yuan. The initial Bombay telegram reported a rise of two annas, but it was difficult for the price to rise above 9 yuan. Zhao Feng Chang continued to buy, and Ying Feng Heng also showed appetite, stabilizing the situation. Furthermore, Heng Yu and Da De Cheng competed to purchase, rising to 50 yuan and 7 jiao. Although there was a slight decline, the China-Belgium Bank, Orient, etc. all took November American dollars at .6875, and goods were lifted strongly, rising to 1 yuan and 2 jiao. The closing price was 851 yuan. After the market closed, Hong Li sold slightly, retreating to around 50 yuan, but ultimately pulling back to over 1 yuan. Goods closed at .08 jiao. The highest price of the day was 851 yuan and 8 jiao, and the lowest price was 847 yuan and 8 jiao, with only four yuan of fluctuation. As a result, it rose 6 yuan and 8 jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price, due to HSBC Bank's listing of American dollars shrinking by .25, was 27 yuan and .75, corresponding to a standard gold price of 864 yuan, 8 jiao, and 6 fen. According to the closing price, it was approximately 14 yuan short, a little over one yuan more short than the previous close. The registered price for this month was 854 yuan, and for September it was 849 yuan. The morning replenishment was 854 yuan, and the afternoon replenishment was 856 yuan. The clam shell price remained at 190 yuan. The situation in the market was calm, with only Ying Feng Heng engaging in slight buying and selling. Overall, they added 196 yuan and a half. The merchants sold 100 taels to Ying Feng Heng. Fellow dealers seemed uninterested, as this price was still the selling price of ordinary goods after being refined, making it difficult to profit. There were still 770 remaining strips for this month.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market were limited, and boredom was frequently observed. In summary, Heng Xing, Wan Xing, Yuan Chun, Qian Chang Xiang, Xie Xing Yong, Yi Feng Yong, etc. slightly dominated the selling side, while Zhi Feng Yong, Da De Cheng, Heng Tai Zhao, Feng Chang Qing, Fa Yong, Yuan Feng Yong, etc. were on the buying side. Fu Chang, Fu Yu, and Yi Feng Yong initially came out and then entered, while Da Xing Yong and Heng Yu initially entered and then came out. There was very little demand from each firm. The Dalian group profited, entering and exiting 231 strips each day. Yifeng jointly entered over a hundred and exited a little over 500 strips. The Guang group Heng Xing sold. A total of 23,226 strips were raised in September.</p>
<h3>British Exchange Rate Steady, American Exchange Rate Tight</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign telegraph, London large strips, near and far, all rose .125, American silver rose .25, the British-to-American rate rose one point, the American-to-British rate fell .125, and the price of forward silver fell 0.3 percent. The private telegram was a little over .1875. At the exchange market opening, the near-term selling price was one shilling and three pence for the British exchange rate and 28 yuan and .125 for the American exchange rate, steady for the British and tight by .1875 for the American compared to the previous close. After opening, it seemed tight. HSBC's listing revealed that the British rate shrunk by .125 and the American rate dropped by .25. The subsequent process was ordinary, merely hovering, fluctuating by no more than .0625. Banks traded with each other, initially litigating and then slightly taking American dollars. There were very few transactions in the afternoon. Initially, it seemed loose, then returned to steady. The first Bombay telegram reported a rise of two annas, and the last reported a return of a little over one anna. Finally, the banks' appetite remained healthy. The closing near-term selling price was one shilling and three pence for the British exchange rate and 28 yuan and .125 for the American exchange rate, steady for the British and tight by .1875 for the American compared to the previous close. In the banking world, China-Belgium Bank, Citibank, and Zhong Fu were on the buying side. Trust &amp; Commerce sold, while Mitsui, Taiwan, MacKay, and Zheng Jin all either supported or blocked. Holland, Citibank, and Mitsui blocked slightly. The first order gold business轧過 blocked about ten thousand yuan. Cheng Feng Yong also supplied. Today's transactions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The British exchange rate morning opening near-term selling price was one shilling and three pence. Mitsui sold October .125 to Pan Gen. Zhong Fu offered Sassoon August .0625. Holland blocked the same month at the same price. Citibank sold August .0625 to Zheng Jin. The noon close near-term selling price was one shilling and three pence. In the afternoon market, Zheng Jin sold August .0625 to Korea. The closing selling price was one shilling and three pence for August, .0625 for September, .125 for October, and .1875 for November, with the buying price increasing by .0625.</p>
<p>The American exchange rate morning opening near-term selling price was 28 yuan and .125. China-Belgium Bank blocked November .625 and took October for half a yuan.

<h3>Securities Appetite Moves, Public Bonds Gradually Rise</h3>
<p>丨Consistently Rose Nicely from Two or Three Jiao to Six or Seven Jiao丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange gradually trended firmer. Number 46 was still being sold, but it was already felt that supply was not meeting demand. The investigation bureau had no problems, and the recovery of lost territory was also said to be proceeding smoothly. Market sentiment remained quite strong. Given that Number 46 was being sold less and less, popularity was also becoming more stable. Because large investors were selling a lot, the market price actually rose higher and higher. This situation was because large investors who wanted to buy in had no opportunity, and if they casually bought in the market, the market price would definitely be raised. Therefore, they took advantage of large investors selling off and took the opportunity to buy in, which could avoid leaving traces. People who knew this reason all changed to being bullish, and the market price gradually rose. It will not be easy to retreat. Yesterday morning's two rounds each showed a rise of two or three jiao, the trend was extremely consistent, and the amount of the rise of each bond was also quite average. Although Number 46 was being sold, the quantity was already limited, and there was a price limit, definitely not like short sellers unloading goods, madly selling in the hope of suppressing the market price. Each group's appetite gradually moved. There was not much entry or exit from the northern group. As a result, the market price rose from two or three jiao to six or seven jiao. The total amount transacted was 9.41 million yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot goods. The total amount of futures salt tax was 3.61 million, troop reduction accounted for 900,000,500,000, and 19 customs duty accounted for 1 million, twenty-volume twenty customs accounted for 2.035 million, and the remainder ranged from tens of thousands to 600,000.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Slightly Soft</h3>
<p>Sinfeng Foreign Company reported that on Thursday (10th), the New York stock market was still firm in the morning, but later, because the United States Steel Corporation's backlog of orders report decreased by 86,546 tons, bullish investors unloaded enthusiastically. However, the market absorbed it easily, and the result was slightly weaker than yesterday. The total turnover for the day was 2.82 million shares. Wheat remained firm throughout because of general expectations that the government report would benefit bullish investors. (After the market closed, the government issued a report stating that the total national wheat production was 499,671,000 bushels, compared to 726,000,000 bushels last year.) Spot cotton merchants were still buying, while brokers from the South and various cooperatives were all selling. The general public participated very little. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks 97.58 Down 1.48</p>
<p>Twenty Railroad Stocks 49.29 Down 0.38</p>
<p>Twenty Utility Stocks 31.50 Down 0.35</p>
<p>Forty Bonds 88.19 Up 0.07</p>
<h3>Gauze and Yarn</h3>
<p>(American Cotton and Jiangsu Cotton Yarn Price Plunge)</p>
<p>The price slump in the yarn market is especially fierce. Due to the poor condition of American cotton and sluggish domestic demand, bullish investors are showing unease. As the cotton market declines, the yarn market is increasingly affected. Bullish investors have no choice but to cut their losses painfully. However, some short sellers have obtained compensation, but this has not been able to stop the price decline, which shows how bad the environment is.</p>
<p>(Bullish Investors Cutting Losses in Shanghai Yarn) At the opening of the Shanghai Yarn Exchange, due to the slump in American cotton and widespread anxiety, selling pressure resurfaced. Prices for all months fell by more than 3.40 cents. The afternoon session remained weak, with prices for all months falling again by 1.35 cents. Total transaction volume for the day was 53,200 bales. Sales included 1,700 bales of Jifeng, 1,300 bales of Dafeng, 2,950 bales of Changyu, 1,000 bales of Xinhua, and 1,100 bales of Dachang. Purchases included 2,150 bales of Yuanda, 3,750 bales of Lichang, 1,150 bales of Yuande, 1,350 bales of Shenji, and 3,300 bales of Tongxing. Closing prices were as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Yarn Exchange Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, and Open Interest</p>
<p>August: 18.27, down 15, 379,000</p>
<p>September: 18.62, down 14, 621,150</p>
<p>October: 18.83, down 13, 683,350</p>
<p>November: 18.98, down 15, 499,400</p>
<p>December: 19.08, down 14, 325,500</p>
<p>January: 19.18, down 14, 281,100</p>
<p>Total: 274,000</p>
<p>(Sluggish Yarn Sales as Usual) The clearance of existing yarn is quite slow. Total purchases by various guilds for the day were only 225 bales, with prices falling by 0.50 to 1 yuan. Purchase amounts by various guilds were as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong: 75, Inland: 95, Northern Guild: 10, Fellow Traders: 20</p>
<p>Jiangxi: 5, Xuzhou: 5, Ningbo: 5, Wuhu: 14</p>
<p>August futures of old cotton are showing signs of collapse. (1) The condition of American cotton is poor. (2) The price difference between new and old cotton is about 3-4 yuan. (3) Many yarn factories are closing down due to business difficulties and are selling their remaining raw materials on the exchange. Over 10,000 piculs of Ningbo Yao cotton are in Shanghai, ready for delivery. Due to these factors, vulnerabilities have suddenly appeared in the market. However, most of the bullish investors have not yet exited. Judging from the overall situation, there may be a sharp price decline in the future.</p>
<p>(Ningbo Guild Hedging by Selling Jiangsu Cotton) At the opening of the Zheng Yarn Exchange, prices fell following American cotton. The Ningbo Guild sold a large amount for hedging, overwhelming the market sentiment. Prices for all months fell by 4.6 cents. The current month fell sharply in the afternoon due to poor market sentiment and many sellers. Prices for all months fell by 0.40 to 0.15 cents. Total transaction volume for the day was 114,800 piculs. Sales included 8,200 piculs of Jifeng, 4,800 piculs of Chungi, 4,600 piculs of Dafeng, 6,000 piculs of Tongxing, 4,100 piculs of Yifeng, 4,900 piculs of Yuanxingchang, and 4,000 piculs of Changhe, 3,100 piculs of Xincheng. Purchases included 11,000 piculs of Yuanda, 3,800 piculs of Yuda, 3,000 piculs of Lichang, 3,400 piculs of Renfeng, 3,300 piculs of Dachang, and 10,000 piculs of Dachang. Closing prices were as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Yarn Exchange Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, and Open Interest</p>
<p>August: 46.15, down 95, 123,800</p>
<p>October: 42.70, up 60, 139,900</p>
<p>November: 42.50, up 55, 143,200</p>
<p>December: 42.55, down 50, 96,000</p>
<p>January: 42.55, up 55, 54,500</p>
<p>Total: 557,400</p>
<p>(Manufacturers Completely Uninterested in Purchasing) The current cotton business is stagnant due to bearish sentiment towards foreign cotton, a sharp decline in Indian cotton, and good domestic new cotton. Yarn prices are weak, and factories have no intention of purchasing raw materials. Sources include 1,600 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Falls Back 20 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton rose initially due to buying by fellow traders, but then fell due to weakness on Wall Street and a good harvest. As a result, spot prices fell by 20 points, and futures fell by 18 to 22 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by 4 points, and futures rose by 12 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 4 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to European exports selling to the south and old bullish investors closing positions. As a result, Pingal fell by 2.5 rupees, Oomra fell by 4 rupees, and White Broach fell by 3 rupees 2.5 annas. Original telegram recorded on the left. (10th telegram)</p>
<p>American Cotton Compared to Previous Day, Converted to National Currency; English Cotton Compared to Previous Day, Converted to National Currency</p>

<p>White Broach: 193.00, down 3.25, 39.90</p>
<h3>Grain and Flour Market Changes Three Times a Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for all months initially showed signs of falling before stabilizing. The quoted price of foreign wheat was only 4/8 cents in Chicago and 12 cents in Canada. Therefore, after closing, the near months saw the lowest record again, with this month reaching a low of 2 yuan 24 cents 7.5 li, September reaching 2 yuan 25 cents 7.5 li, and October also briefly opening at 3 cents, falling to 2 yuan 29 cents. November reached 2 yuan 32 cents, while December and January saw little change. Later, because several small factories tried their best to cover short positions, and there were rumors that the Nanyang Guild was inquiring about spot flour, the market immediately reversed, rising by 2/3 cents compared to the lowest point. By the time the afternoon session opened, it was initially stable, but then the clearance of spot flour remained sluggish (a telegram from Tianjin reported that spot flour prices fell by 4 cents), and large factories continued to sell for hedging. Bullish customer guilds also gradually closed positions, causing near and distant months to soften again. Judging from the market for the whole day, it seemed to be in complete chaos. However, considering the stagnant nature of spot goods, there seems to be little hope for a lively market in the future. As a result, September and October fell by 0.5 li compared to the previous day, October remained unchanged, November fell by 2.5 li, December remained unchanged, and January rose by 2.5 li, it is said.</p>
<h3>Dull Spot Wheat Market, Mixed Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, prices for all months showed signs of continuing to fall. The quoted price of foreign wheat was only slightly better, and market sentiment was exceptionally weak. Therefore, prices fell by 3/4 cents when opening. Later, major short sellers were seen covering actively, and prices rebounded. When the afternoon session opened, prices initially rose by 2/3/4 cents, and market sentiment was also quite strong. However, after the third session, the flour market fell again, and spot flour from Tianjin was readily available everywhere, showing signs of accumulation. Therefore, sentiment in the near term weakened again. Considering the stagnant sales of flour, it is still not easy for the wheat market to reverse. As a result, this month fell by 2 cents, September rose by 1 cent, October and November remained unchanged, and December and January rose by 3 cents. The spot wheat market remained dull, and factories did not inquire about medium-grade wheat. High-grade wheat saw some response, with Wuhe wheat opening at 3 yuan 90 cents, Yaowan wheat at 3 yuan 87 cents to 88 cents, and Suzhou wheat at 3 yuan 71 cents, totaling two thousand plus bags, it is said.</p>
<h3>Low River Rice Sales Stagnant, Prices Continue to Fall by About 10 Cents</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source was forty or fifty boats, the market sales were still stagnant, and the will of a few retailers was flat. Therefore, the overall situation showed no improvement. The statistics show that the retailers' sales totaled only about a thousand bags. Therefore, thick japonica, thin indica, and Duyang pointed rice prices were slightly loose by about 10 cents. Converted to yuan, the appetite was still good, and the market continued to strengthen. Factory owners were firm on flour and were not easily shaken, maintaining the old levels.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source from various Jiangxia guilds was twenty-three or four boats. Although the arrival of Northern Guild white japonica has not been strong recently, sales were stagnant and slow. The market also dropped slightly by 10 cents, and Yangdu pointed rice followed slightly. Early thin indica and Baiyuan customer pointed rice and Dongxin japonica arrivals were few and sales were flat, and price momentum stabilized.</p>
<h3>Customer Xian Rice Sales Active in South China</h3>
<p>Yesterday, customer xian rice prices rose and fell unevenly, resulting in a flat trend. Coarse rice fell slightly, while machine rice gradually rose. Arrivals continued by train, such as products from nearby Nanjing and Jiangxi and Anhui provinces, which were more than elsewhere. Wuxi also had arrivals, while Hunan and Jiangxi rice were scarce in both arrivals and inventory. Yesterday, market sales turned active again, especially in Zhejiang and the southern provinces. Sales in Fujian were active in the morning, and the Guangdong Guild also inquired. The Ningbo-Taizhou-Yongbo Guild in Zhejiang Province all made purchases, so market sentiment remained stable. The Guangdong Guild purchased 167 bags of Hunan machine-milled red rice at 7 yuan 33 cents, the Fujian Guild purchased 300 bags of Qianjing at 5 yuan 60 cents, Nanjing machine-milled xian rice was sold at 850 bags for 6 yuan 10 cents, 6 yuan to 5 yuan 85 cents, and the Ningbo Guild purchased 115 bags of Jiangkou at 5 yuan 70 cents. The Wuxi coarse rice by Ningbo-Taizhou Guild sold 648 bags at 5 yuan 25 cents to 5 yuan 13 cents.</p>
<h3>Foreign Farm Rapeseed Opens at 5.5 Taels</h3>
<p>The rapeseed market situation was slightly weak due to the lack of sales for foreign farms. Fortunately, oil factories inquired, so the market stabilized slightly. Yesterday, Dayouyu Oil Factory purchased 2,000 bags of Wuhu foreign farm goods, with the price opening at 5 taels and 5 mace (equivalent to 7 yuan 70 cents in silver), which was a bag-only, tax-free transaction.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Five-Blessing White Crystal Sugar Rises by 6 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market turned upward with rising gold prices and a slight contraction in Dutch exchange rates. The trend remained firm. The guild’s opening price for 24 raw sugar, white ordinary goods, was 20 yuan 93 cents, later rising to 95 cents, up 2 cents from the previous day. There were no transactions in No. 20 medium sugar white, at about 20 yuan 40 cents. Dutch red new goods, KD mark, were 16 yuan 60 cents, and old goods, KNG mark, were 16 yuan 45 cents, up 5 cents from the previous day. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 21 yuan 20 cents, original price. This factory’s fine white sugar, such as Zhonghua, Guohua, and Zhenji No. 1 goods, were all 20 yuan, and the rest remained the same as before. Guangdong Guild merchants opened high for 40-50 bags of Huizhou white sugar at 20 yuan and 200 bags of Guangdong crystal sugar, opening at 23 yuan 20 cents, up 2 jiao from the previous day. Chaozhou Guild merchants opened for over 90 bags of Tizhuang green sugar at 15 yuan 30 cents to 20 cents. The Jianbang Dalaihua opened 70 boxes of Five-Blessing white crystal sugar, with each box priced at 17 yuan 80 cents, up 6 jiao from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods</h3>
<p>Candied Dates and White Lotus Seeds Continue to Decline</p>
<p>Since the new Jiashan candied dates came out, the market price has continued to decline. The previous market had fallen from 45 yuan to 40 yuan, and yesterday's market fell sharply to around 34 yuan, down another 6 yuan. Upper and lower traders routinely added and refunded, and the market situation was flat.</p>
<p>Recently, white lotus seeds have continued to decline in land prices because sales have not been smooth. The Shanghai market has also followed suit, and yesterday's market had reached 40 yuan, down another 5 yuan from the previous day. The trend is still difficult to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>White Factory Raw Silk Exports to America Gain Momentum</p>
<p>(Changan Autumn Silkworms Suffer from Heat and Stagnant Leaf Consumption) The Changan area has always been a famous silkworm area. This year's autumn silkworm rearing has increased sharply, and development was very smooth at the beginning. Currently, they are in the third eye leaf opening stage. In the past two days, the weather has been hot and humid, and silkworms have experienced stagnant leaf consumption and insomnia. The instructors have been running around to adjust and care for them, which is quite diligent.</p>
<p>(Sichuan-Hankou New Yellow Silk Shipments to Shanghai Not Weak) Both Sichuan and Hankou have reported bumper harvests of cocoons for the past few springs. Since the opening of new cocoon reeling by iron, wooden, and small-wheeled silk factories, over 690 piculs of new yellow silk from Jinzhou, Wuyang, He Rong, and Guopen have been shipped to Shanghai and stored in various yellow silk warehouses.</p>
<p>(Firm Exchange Rate Boosts Rayon Sales) Recently, the foreign exchange rate has been firm, and rayon sales have continued to be strong. Yesterday, eight, nine, and ten months futures of coarse and fine threads, Kaili, Guangmang, Shuanglong, Feixiang, Meinu, and other brands, were brought in by the Hangzhou-Huzhou guilds, totaling 58 boxes, with prices ranging from 183 yuan 75 cents to 171 yuan 25 cents net.</p>
<p>(American Firms Take Advantage of Cheap Prices to Purchase White Factory Raw Silk) Since the inflation in the United States, various silk factories have settled their labor disputes, and prices are about to be full, preparing to start work. The demand for raw silk is gradually rising, and the New York silk market is trending upward. Yesterday morning, American telegrams for white factory raw silk continued to arrive in Shanghai. American firms took advantage of the opportunity for various manufacturers to sell their remaining silk and began to purchase it in bulk. Over 100 bales of spot white factory raw silk were traded. The price was based on the New York standard of Japanese silk, which was only 770/780 yuan in national currency, so it was 160/170 yuan less than the highest price last month.</p>
<h3>Needle, Eyebrow, Pearl Tea Exports to Europe Continue to Be Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, European firms showed strong interest in needle, eyebrow, and pearl tea from incoming companies. Goods with excellent body and bone structure have been sold out. As for Zhenmei green tea, the situation has not made significant progress. Ordinary companies, only Yuandong Lu Tea, Tianyu, Ye Tea, Fushi and other firms purchased and sold, and the selling price fell back 10 yuan. The remaining Tunxi goods from all roads were sluggish, and the large firms were slightly weaker than before, with asking prices falling by 2/3 yuan. However, for Gongxi, because the source is scarce, the market remains firm as before, it is said.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<h3>Sichuan Guild Purchases Large Quantities of Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the woolen fabric guild was slightly better than last week. As the hot weather is about to end, sales of woolen products are gradually moving. Taikoo Yu, Dachuan Tong, Jardine Yu, Yiji, Xieji Xing, Huiji Xing, Xiangyu Gong and other large and small Sichuan guilds stationed in Shanghai have purchased large quantities. Parcels sent to the post office are very crowded. The most popular goods are 6-7 yuan flannel for suits and the lower-grade Yuanping thick flannel, and three kinds of yellow-grey Walter flannel. Although the transaction of mixed-color Walter flannel, plaid Walter flannel, Yuanchang blue-grey serge, one-foot-six velvet, felt flannel, and Yuanpi velvet is not weak, the market is slightly inferior. Most of them deliver goods and issue tickets, and there are also many who put the account on hold after the return receipt is received.</p>
<p>Business Sutras (13)</p>
<h3>Introducing Several Types of Domestically Produced Dried Shrimp by Zheng Xinsheng</h3>
<p>Dried shrimp, also known as "Kaiyang", is a delicious seafood that is loved by many. Most of the dried shrimp sold in the market are foreign goods, especially Japanese goods. Because of this, many enthusiastic patriots would rather give up eating it. However, they do not know that there are also domestically produced dried shrimp. Now I will list several types so that you know how to choose them.</p>
<p>(1) Yantai tail (i.e., Yantai dried shrimp, people in the industry use the word "tail" instead of dried shrimp, as a general term for dried shrimp.) Produced in Yantai, Shandong, it is the top grade among domestic products. It has a very fresh taste and comes in various sizes. It is packaged separately and is quite uniform. The color is bright yellow, and there are few skin scraps, which is quite equivalent to the foreign "Jinshan tail" and so on. The output is abundant, which is sufficient for domestic consumption.</p>
<p>(2) Wen Kai, or Wenzhou tail, is produced in Wenzhou, Zhejiang. The shape is small to medium, with few large ones, and the taste is quite fresh. The color is bright yellow, and there are few skin scraps, making it suitable for general consumption. The production volume is relatively abundant.</p>
<p>(3) Yanghe Kaiyang is produced in Siyang Baiyanghe. The goods are smooth, delicate, pure, and the taste is particularly delicious. However, the production volume has not been high in recent years, and very little is shipped out.</p>
<p>(4) Jiangbei tail is produced in Jiangbei commercial posts, such as Huaian. The shape is smaller, the color is slightly red, and it is quite clean, and the body is very dry. However, the taste is weak. Most of the dried shrimp sold on the market are soaked in salt water and then dried again to give it a taste. The price is the cheapest, suitable for small restaurants.</p>
<p>(5) Si tail is produced in Siyang, Jiangbei. The shape is slightly flat, the size is moderate, and the color is light yellow. There are occasional skin scraps, and the taste is average.</p>
<p>(6) Hui tail is extremely large in size, the color is light yellow, and the taste is average. However, the Shaoxing Guild likes it very much.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>The Great Enemy of Youth Psychology</h3>
<p>— Erchu</p>
<p>Speaking of Chinese youth, it really makes people heartbroken and feel the sorrow of this aging motherland becoming increasingly hopeless! This is undeniable. The distortion of Chinese youth's thinking and the deformity and contradiction of their psychology are really the fatal wounds of the country. Watching the youth walk towards the grave in groups, how can people not feel sad!</p>
<p>For the sake of the country's survival and the nation's prosperity, the only way is to use a pure vision and a clear mind to explore the morbid state of modern youth; then, from the morbid state, find out the crux of the pathology, prescribe the right medicine, and save the psychologically confused youth. And it is especially important to try to overcome the great enemy in the youth's psychology.</p>
<p>The great enemies of the psychology of Chinese youth are really too numerous to mention, and the major ones are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Blind obedience Youths are often shackled by the environment and enter the wrong path. This is indeed a sign of weak will and simple thinking of the youth. As a result, they are impacted by the social system and fall into decline. The revelation of this fact, in the final analysis, is still the result of "blind obedience." For example, a large number of youths do not understand the reasons for China's current weakness; they blindly believe in socialism, echo the Communist Party, destroy everywhere, cause trouble, hinder the development of the country's future, and disrupt the order of society. Not only can they not save the motherland, but they also allow strong neighbors to take advantage of the opportunity, which is ironclad proof of blind obedience.</p>
<p>(2) Megalomania There is no doubt that Chinese youth suffer from extreme megalomania. Inconsistent words and deeds are the first evidence. Often when doing something, they do everything possible to publicize it beforehand, saying it in a flowery way and with great momentum. Who knows that afterwards, there will be no news and no expression at all. For example, some kind of association or group often causes trouble because of this, which reduces the belief of those who consider themselves to be old and high-ranking. Moreover, this kind of "megalomania" is a major obstacle to future career development.</p>
<p>(3) Imitating foreign things Chinese youths who have been westernized are proud of everything "foreign." They think that imitating foreigners is the most modern thing. It is true that imitation cannot be considered a bad thing. Are not the people of the Yamato nation known for their imitation? However, their imitation is completely to choose the essence and remove the dross, and then work hard to add their own creation. However, the average Chinese youth not only does not choose what is beneficial to themselves but imitates those things that are neither beneficial to the country nor have anything to do with oneself. For example: extravagance and extravagance, competing for beauty, what dance halls! Buying dog tickets! etc. It is really painful to talk about!</p>
<p>(4) Lack of creativity No one can deny that Chinese youths lack creativity. However, their active efforts in destructive work are worthy of my praise (?). However, it is necessary to know that after the old and outdated things are destroyed, new construction is urgently needed. If there is no construction after destruction, then this kind of destruction can only be regarded as a reckless act, an unreasonable riot, and the result will affect the peace of society and promote the decline of the national fortune. How shallow is the extent of the harm!</p>
<p>The above four major psychological enemies are enough to plunge China into an unyielding abyss. What's more, there are still many more serious than the above, so how can it not greatly hurt China's vitality.</p>
<p>Living in China under this turbulent era, youths should have a deep understanding of everything in reality, especially to recognize where the current crisis in China lies; do not blindly act. Youths! It is not time for us to be numb. The "megalomania," "fondness of imitating," and "lack of creativity" of the past are our major psychological enemies, and they are also the major enemies of saving the precarious motherland. We should strive to eliminate bad habits and be a youth who shoulders a major mission from today, stepping on the blood of the martyrs to reclaim the lost territory of our Chinese youth, that is, of all Chinese compatriots.</p>
<p>Remember, dear youths!</p>
<p>Finally, I feel that I have no specific relief methods to contribute to this problem, but only write down a few items about the psychological morbidity of the youth. However, this is my cry after sadness! I hope that my cry will arouse attention from many aspects and discuss a fundamental method of youth psychological construction; give the youth a lifeline, and it can also be used to gradually make China hopeful. This is my hope!</p>
<p>Clerk Communication</p>
<h3>Handling Unpaid Debts</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I admire your newspaper's clerk communication very much. Now there is a difficult problem to solve, and I have repeatedly wanted to ask for your advice to solve it, but I am afraid that the words are not words and the sentences are not sentences, so I finally dare not try. Now this matter needs to be resolved urgently, so I wrote this letter regardless, and I hope that you will solve it for me.</p>
<p>There are two brothers in my family. I am an employee in a cigarette paper shop, and my brother is a worker. Because of economic reasons, and because my mother eagerly wanted a grandson, my brother married before me. Due to my father's business failure and heavy debts during his lifetime, this spring, my brother and I were at home. As appointed by the clan elders, my mother and my brother's wife and sister's living expenses are to be sent back by me every month; all debts are to be sent by my brother every month by 10 yuan to be gradually paid back. Unexpectedly, last month my brother suddenly brought his wife to live in Shanghai, and now he excuses that the living expenses are too great and reduces the amount of 10 yuan, so that there is not enough to distribute to all the debts. I have repeatedly advised him to send his wife back to save expenses, but good advice falls on deaf ears; and my mother raises her son to prevent old age, but now she sees this situation and is depressed and sick. Because my salary is limited, in addition to sending living expenses to my family every month, I have no surplus to supplement his insufficiency. This fact puts me in a dilemma! Now I urge you to help me find a solution, I would be very grateful. Respectfully, Ma Jiliang</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>Editor's note: Adult brothers, especially married brothers, living together, although it cannot be said that it is a bad thing, it is absolutely impossible to force it. In case of any hatred of this system between them or any party, there is no way to bring them back together. Your brother has already taken this action, and it is impossible to persuade him to come back and live together as before; even if it is forced, because there is resentment in the heart, there will be many quarrels. So according to our opinion, you seem to should give up this hope and negotiate with your brother on how to handle the unpaid debts.</p>
<p>According to the tone of your letter, you seem to want your brother to continue to send 10 yuan a month to repay the debts; this is inevitably somewhat unreasonable. You think, his wife has already gone to live separately in Shanghai, and his responsibility should naturally be reduced accordingly. But your brother's opinion, wanting to excuse that the expenses in Shanghai are huge, and not sending this money, is also wrong: we know that it is very common to organize a small family in Shanghai for 20 to 30 yuan a month, can he ask you to subsidize it? Then what is the best way?</p>
<p>Here, we have calculated a number for you very carefully: before calculating, we must first admit three facts. First, the clan elders' public judgment method was agreed by both parties and is considered a very fair solution. Second, the responsibility for your mother and sister's living expenses and unpaid debts is shared equally by the brothers. Third, the amount of living expenses for your mother, sister, and your brother's wife is assumed to be about the same. If we admit these three points, it is not difficult to calculate how much money your brother should send back to the family every month. Of the 10 yuan that your brother sent back every month, 5 yuan was for repaying the debts, and the remaining 5 yuan was for paying the living expenses of one of your mother and sister, and his wife. This shows that the living expenses of each person are 2 yuan and 5 jiao, and what your brother should now take out every month is naturally the 5 yuan for repaying the debts and 2 yuan and 5 jiao for the living expenses of one of your mother and sister, totaling 7 yuan</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>5 jiao. If you can also send 7 yuan and 5 jiao back every month, wouldn't there be 15 yuan a month? With 5 yuan for living expenses (of course, they still have to cook and eat as before), wouldn't there still be 10 yuan a month to repay the debts? Why don't you ask the clan elders to say this to your brother?</p>

<h3>Under the Red and Green Lights (51)</h3>
<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>(27) This is a Sign of China's Rising</p>
<p>Shi Qiao, whose spirit had long been dull and rusty, shone brightly anew tonight, his heart blooming as he walked tirelessly. This day had completely changed, China had risen, Shanghai was China's Shanghai, and the masses here were not afraid of the interference of the police. If those foreigners dared to say even half a word, they would surely burn down the police station and consulates. See the power of our great Chinese nation! Shi Qiao felt so happy in his heart! He had fully recovered his youthful spirit, striding forward with high steps. Suddenly, a foreigner, passing by, was also so moved that he grabbed his hand inexplicably, shaking it continuously, saying in broken Chinese: "Your country has good national spirit! Quickly build airplanes! Fighting with just lives is not enough! The (blank) people are no match for your country! Work hard, my dear friend!" Saying this, he went to shake the hand of another Chinese person, as if he had been filled with beer. Shi Qiao nodded in his heart: "Yes, quickly build airplanes, build bombs, and sink that island nation to the bottom of the sea." He had unknowingly arrived at the Eight Immortals Bridge, where the sound of firecrackers was even more deafening. The children selling extra editions of newspapers were three times more profitable tonight, with dozens of small and large newspapers prominently displaying the eight large characters "Ishikawa Killed in Action" and "Recovery of Liuhe." This lively scene continued until late into the night, without the slightest fatigue. Shi Qiao continued to walk to the end of North Sichuan Road, becoming more and more excited. When he returned to his room! Yes, tonight he unhesitatingly returned to his own garret. Liharnov and Mizi were not asleep yet, still watching the unabated liveliness. Liharnov was the first to shake Shi Qiao's hand tonight, extending his left hand, raising a thumb, and praising Shi Qiao repeatedly. It seemed that Liharnov's cold heart had also been filled with heat, which was really not easy. Mizi, freed from Liharnov's surveillance for the night, embraced Shi Qiao violently like a storm, shaking him and kissing him passionately. Since leaving Mizi, Shi Qiao had also been wandering painfully for several days. Once embraced by Mizi, he felt indescribable comfort and gratitude. For the first time, he boldly put his arms around her waist and kissed her deeply. Then, Shi Qiao stealthily moved a hand inside and grabbed Mizi's breast. Mizi chuckled and broke away, exclaiming:</p>
<p>"I'll bite you to death!"</p>
<p>They looked at each other for a while and then laughed again. After a long time, she sat on him and asked:</p>
<p>"Where have you been these past few days? It's so good that Ishikawa is dead, that murdering fiend!"</p>
<p>"He is your great general!" Shi Qiao teased her.</p>
<p>"You're talking nonsense again!" Then she said: "I can see you turn over, I always feel happy, I don't know why, I would rather like you also work hard!"</p>

<h3>On the Invention of Open-Air Cinema</h3>
<p>— Gao Ming</p>
<p>Having read in the July 31st issue of this publication that a Guangdong Shaozhou native, Huang Daoheng, has invented a type of open-air cinema and is applying to the Ministry of Industry for a patent, I cannot help but deeply regret my own situation. If there is indeed destiny, then I must be destined to be poor for life. Because although I have not been engaged in the film industry for more than ten years, I had already "invented" this "type of open-air cinema" four or five years ago. Because I was destined to be poor, after the "invention," I finally dared not, like Mr. Huang Daoheng, grandly request a patent from the Ministry of Industry. Otherwise, with these four or five years, my belly could have become quite plump. Alas!</p>
<p>Originally, my "invention" was learned from a classmate during my studies in Japan; to be more precise, it was from the Kanda Theater in Tokyo, Japan. Perhaps some people will say that my statement is not coherent, and even feel doubtful about my "invention" itself. But, dear readers, you must know that, very obviously, their same design is called "light-resistant cinema," while mine is called "a type of open-air cinema"!</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about the structure of my "type of open-air cinema." Because I have not obtained a patent from the Ministry of Industry, I will turn to gaining the understanding of my dear readers, or giving some comfort to my "invention."</p>
<p>According to my "invention," the projection room is not installed in front of the screen and behind the audience seats, as in ordinary movie theaters, but is hidden behind the screen. The projection room is installed on one side behind the screen, and the projected images are reflected by a mirror onto the screen. As for the screen, an ordinary screen will do: just add a thin layer of black gauze to its surface (the side facing the audience). Yes, that's all it takes.</p>
<p>Dear readers, you may ask me with absolute disbelief: "Is this all there is to your 'invention'?" Yes, dear readers, yes, this is all there is to my "invention." Oh, believe me, I am not lying.</p>
<p>The special effect of my "type of open-air cinema" is exactly the same as that of Mr. Huang Daoheng's "type of open-air cinema," allowing the audience seats to be exposed to light, without the need for complete darkness, and the windows can also be opened to allow air to circulate. Looking back at Japan's "light-resistant cinema," it is only sufficient to maintain public morals, so it can be seen that my "invention" is much more profound than those dwarfs'.</p>
<p>Although my failure is due to destiny, I am willing to sincerely wish our Mr. Huang Daoheng's "invention" future success. And I hope that in the near future, he can make even more amazing "inventions"!</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Man Against Woman"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Produced by Columbia 丨 Premiered at Carlton</p>
<p>Among Columbia's productions, this work can be considered fairly satisfactory. However, this is only in terms of performance, the most obvious being the director's proper control of the actors. For example, Jack Holt, with his tall stature and heroic bearing, we acknowledged his considerable achievements in "Spicy Hands Punish Lust" not long ago. And here, playing a strong, forceful, calm and resolute detective, he obviously has considerable success. Although the female lead, Lilan Maas, has not changed much, she has done her duty because she is willing to work hard. Gavin Gordon is indeed better than in "Gold Rush," and Wilt Conronon is also satisfactory with his unexaggerated skills.</p>
<p>This means that with these actors, the performance is still worth watching. This is of course because the director has a detailed grasp of each character, and at the same time, the actors can grasp the personality of the characters, so that this film still has many achievements in form. In particular, Gavin Gordon's portrayal of a young man with a weak will and panicking in the face of trouble can be said to be lifelike.</p>
<p>Apart from this, we can also see that the director is very attentive to the handling or editing of individual shots. For example, when the detective finally overcomes his rival, he is accompanied by the sorrowful and touching singing of his lover. The scene of the villains being captured with armed guards, and the singer clearing her fiancé's name are all very economical and clever methods. But there are also inappropriate places, such as when the detective captures the black robber, the daring snatching of the pistol is very clever, but when the young man who stole the money already intends to kill the detective, but the detective uses the same method of capturing the black man to take his pistol, it is very far-fetched. As for the handling of the shots, although it is all the use of old methods, it is also very smooth and not vulgar.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the story.</p>
<p>This is probably a fixed formula, especially among American film producers, who almost always make this type of film in the same format. The screenwriter decides to create a superhuman hero, not only is this person of superior intelligence, but also behaves uprightly and loyally serves the country, so he uses villains and thieves to set off the greatness of the hero. And the hero must have a beauty to match, so after the hero eliminates the villains and thieves, he will inevitably gain the favor of the beauty. This formula has been used countless times on Van Mink, Tom Miss and others, and since Jack Holt has this specialty, the screenwriter uses him to show his skills in this formula.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, there is no need to describe the story of this film in detail here, we can almost imagine it. The only difference between it and other works with the same content is, at best, the difference in names or slight differences in plot. However, the ending of this film is even more naive, making the hero and beauty get engaged under the matchmaking of the sheriff, almost making people unable to help but laugh, so this film is worthless in terms of story.</p>
<h3>"Sunset Pass" Review Shin Kwang 丨 Great China</h3>
<p>— Mi Wu</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, "Sunset Pass" is another new film about child heroes. A member of a livestock association, Jack Locke, uses the greatest courage and effort to uncover the secret of cattle thieves, saves the ranch owner, and marries the ranch owner's fake sister, Jane Yin. We know that the origin of martial arts stories is entirely because the oppressed are unable to resist, so they create a story to comfort themselves. But because of the limitations of feudal, established laws and moral concepts, they cannot completely resist, and finally the characters created have to submit to what they call "righteousness" and "order." Jack Locke is such a person. As for the ranch owner who has already made a fortune, although it is obvious that he was also a thief in the past, he finally "destroyed all the documents to prevent Jane Yin from understanding his secret." In this way, the central consciousness of the "Sunset Pass" producers is not difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Originally, a film's expression of the author's consciousness is absolutely impossible to hide, and "Sunset Pass" is even more obvious.</p>
<p>As for the technical aspects, the first point worth mentioning is that ordinary martial arts films often create suspense in the development of the story. Only later does it gradually become clear; and in the end, the truth comes out. But this "Sunset Pass" is just the opposite, it is very clear at the beginning, but later with more interjections, suspense comes, like Jack Locke's impersonation of Collins, and Hansby's admission of being Collins, which is already dizzying. Finally, he burns all the documents to end the film, and the secret of the livestock farm owner is even more impossible to reveal. This is naturally the consciousness of the producers (to avoid the owner's name) that determines!</p>
<p>In addition, "Sunset Pass" is a film that completely focuses on martial arts, so the director pays special attention to the battle scenes, and there are many battle scenes in the whole film. In the middle of the angry horses galloping, the sound of guns and shadows are really thrilling. Especially the scene at night, it seems even more murderous. The fade-in and fade-out shots in the whole film are used appropriately, and they are never like the chaotic use of Chinese films.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the male lead is extremely hard-working, he is almost more diligent than the play needs. Therefore, it seems to be a bit excessive. The female lead is too inadequate. But maybe it's because there are too few places to act.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Review of "Light of Motherhood"</h3>
<p>— E</p>
<p>In the present time when women's issues have become a major social problem, this film "Light of Motherhood" does have its special value, and makes it emit the great light of new motherhood in society!</p>
<p>For thousands of years, women have been bound by "domestic labor," gasping for breath under multiple oppressions. In the past, all women's movements were actually of no benefit to women. Especially for the lower-class working women, not only did they fail to liberate them, but they made them darker. However, in the Soviet Union, since the success of the revolution, on the one hand, the political and economic status of women was improved in law, and on the other hand, efforts were made in nurseries and public dining halls. The universal construction of these public institutions enabled every woman to be truly completely liberated from "domestic labor." Only then did women get completely liberated materially and spiritually. Therefore, the focus of "Light of Motherhood" is able to pay attention to "nurseries," which does have its new meaning.</p>
<p>The performance atmosphere of the film is very sufficient. Except for the mining atmosphere, which is relatively lacking due to practical difficulties, the rest is absolutely free from the "cold and heat disease" state of hot and cold, keeping the audience's attention always on the film. In addition, the magnificence of the music hall set is rarely seen in Chinese films, and some of the shots are also worthy of praise, such as the exterior shots of Jiahu (Jin Yan) and Huiying (Li Zhuozhuo), the shots of them walking side by side from far to near, the way of shooting that gradually rises, it is very beautiful and pleasant, and there are also some very good angles.</p>
<p>Because the majority of the story focuses on the center of "light of motherly love" and "tears of a good mother," the result is that this film has become a "sentimental drama of human feelings." And ignoring the great brilliance of new motherhood. Therefore, the impression given to the audience is that the several performances of the "nursery" in the back can also be said to be the main point of "light of motherhood." It is not able to win back the audience's deep impression of the great virtuous wife and good mother in the front. And this kind of poor people's nursery atmosphere seems not very poor. I think there are many regrets in these places.</p>
<p>Apart from this, there are still some problems with the subtitles. We know that the subtitles in the film, in addition to explaining the pictures, are mainly dialogues, this kind of dialogue is like a stage play, representing the character and status of the characters in the play, and is absolutely not writing an article. Otherwise, it will form a phenomenon where the dialogue is inconsistent with the characters in the play. Now we will point out the inappropriate places in the subtitles of this film.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Lin, please sit down" When Huiying went to visit her ex-husband Jiahu's house, Jiahu said this. This kind of tone would at least make a calm revolutionary "sour", so I think it's inappropriate, and she should still call her "Huiying"</p>
<p>"After I get well, we'll go back to Shanghai and start our natural life" Xiaomei said to her mother: : : "This little bit of harvest is already worth all the losses." Xiaomei said about her daughter: : : : : The trend of the world economic panic (or the words are different, I can't remember clearly) the tone is like this, has already affected Nanyang. Jiahu said to Jimei: : : : These subtitles, regardless of whether they are "daily expressions" or correct or not, let's not care about them first, the first thing is that the audience's ears feel astringent, and they don't feel like they are spoken naturally by the people in the picture. So although this is a small problem, if it can be made more appropriate, it will also help the effect of the film a lot.</p>

<h3>The Morning Glory (4)</h3>
<p>— Ma Teng</p>
<p>Rita Vernon saw Sheridan and mocked him for being afraid to see people. She also asked Iston, "Didn't you tell me that the play written by Mona and regarded by Sheridan as his most得意 one?" As she spoke, she deliberately squinted at Sheridan with mocking eyes.</p>
<p>Sheridan said; "Why don't you bring the script for me to see?"</p>
<p>Sheridan was startled when he heard this, he stammered and said: "I am translating it now. I know you don't care about that kind of play."</p>
<p>"I care or not, I'll decide for myself. Bring the script for me to see." This is what Rita retorted to Sheridan.</p>
<p>Sheridan told her that there was only one copy of the script, and it was now in his office; but Rita Vernon said, "It doesn't matter, I'll go to your office to see it." He forced Sheridan to go to his office. Iston waited until Sheridan and Rita Vernon left, and sighed and said: "Perhaps she can't even understand it. However, Hodges is still waiting outside. Iston gave Rita"</p>
<p>Vernon缠 for a long time, and then woke up like a dream, and hurriedly stood up and went outside to greet the old actor.</p>
<p>At this time, the people in the outer room of the office were all gone, leaving only Hodges and I. Lorrain丝 two people. The old tea room had already told them to leave their addresses and sent them away. I Because she was sitting inside the railing, she was obviously unusual and still sat still. Iston came out and said to Hai滐斯, "This is not a good role. However, there is no other suitable position now, so I have to ask you to temporarily屈就." Hodges humbly said: "Thank you, it is a great honor to be able to help in your office." Iston said: "You wait, because Mr. Sheridan still wants to write a play about Shakespeare." I 插嘴 said, "Mr. Iston, that's the best thing." She wanted to take this opportunity to attract Iston's attention. Iston looked at this strange woman; Hodges hurriedly introduced her, "This is my student. She wants to be an actor." Iston said, "Oh, really?" I. Lorrain丝 then talked eloquently with Iston. Although Iston, because of his status, was inconvenient to talk in detail with a woman he had just met, he was attracted to this woman. He didn't think she was beautiful, but her words and deeds were very good; she also had confidence and attraction. But I don't know if she has a talent for the stage. He asked her how long she had been on stage. She said that she had not been on stage in a big place, but had客串 in the drama club in her hometown. (To be continued)</p>
