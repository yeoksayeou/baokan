<h3 id="c21">統制經濟與復興農村　實 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>統制經濟之說盛傳一時。而復興農村之議。亦甚囂塵。上蓋一因受美國產業復興計畫之影響。再受國内農工業衰落之激刺。非在根本上能掃除過去無限度生產之狀態。建立當前有計畫之經濟組織。殊無法以挽回頽運。此所以羣趨於此一途也。然而我國今日之工業界。其衰落狀况。固與各國同。而實際情形則大異。以絲茶各業言。如江浙之絲業各廠。今年開工繼續製造者。不及原有設備三分之一。紡紗廠一部分停工者。迄未恢復原狀。茶業亦甚不振。原因並非由於過剩。其他各種重工業。我國本未發達。如漢冶萍廠停工數年。今仍停滯。未聞有開工之準備。各地鑛業。則除開灤等礦爲外資經營尙有若干贏餘外。本國所經營者。無論爲官營爲私營或官私合資之事業。莫不感受賠累苦痛。而交通工業。大之如國營各鐵路。及關係水上交通之招商局。皆不能收支相抵。無法向上發展。加以資本主義各國傾消政策之威脅。尤其是日本。以致本國初生之工業前途。遂益暗淡。因此影響。工廠更難維持。失業人數。逐漸增加。而社會亦由是不安。此中國工商業之現狀也。</p>
<p>我中國經濟機構。雖因工商業之不振而發生變更。而其基礎仍在農業。設使農業能欣欣向榮。或足維持現狀。則工業經濟。縱受恐慌。亦尙可得一部分之調劑。然返觀我國農業生產。在黄河流域各省區黄土層之地質。一方面受特殊氣候之制限。經過數千年之種殖。天然之肥沃。取吸殆盡。旣無人工肥料之培補。又乏水利之灌溉。農業之發展。甚感困難。長江以南各地雖不似北部之枯渴。但近年迭遭水患。元氣亦甚傷殘。且我中國各地。農村土地之分配。大都爲過小農制度。因此改良甚難。而農村經濟。遂愈陷於破產之境域。一般農民在兇年無法自活。都市工廠又不能盡量吸收大量之產業預備隊。豐年則各產米區域。因榖價之低落而成災。以故一般農民。除離村當兵爲匪外。别無出路。</p>
<p>今者欲挽回國民經濟之窮。戰勝農業恐慌。自非集合全力確立一適宜統制之方法不可。且此統制經濟之方法。今已盛行於時。蘇聯之計劃經濟。實質即統制經濟。行之已有成效。着手不過五年。已由經濟落後之國一躍而有超越北美合衆國之勢。美國自恐慌潮流襲來之後。幾至根本動搖。近亦轉換方向。努力於統制經濟。雖非眞正有計劃之生產與消費。然而爲一種非常時間之設施。則確無疑義。至於日本之所謂統制經濟。目的雖在集中精力。爲大戰之準備。然自一九三○年以來。所以得保持生產紀錄不致低落者。亦即用此方法之故。</p>
<p>我國如欲實施統制經濟。論非常時期之條件。固已充分具備。惟一般人民。向多習於散漫。鐵道輪船等重要工業。所以未能發揮其效能者。不僅在管理制度之不善。而亦由於自私之心太重。故今欲改進經濟之組織。必須先清積弊。而後乃能樹立統制經濟之新基礎。農村經濟之須更生。較諸城市尤爲迫切。統制榖物市場。調節榖物價格。週轉農村金融。爲復興農村之初步工作。再進而解决土地問題。培殖一般社會之生產力。使人民皆得盡其所長。然後此非常時期之動作。乃得確收實效也。</p>

<p>、實不能不成立一初步之諒解也、現各大國重新聚集磋商之目的、即爲英國之軍縮計劃、雖已爲各國所接受、認爲討論之根據、但前途尙有其他窒礙、今不得不設法加以清除、且現在各國已深覺前途之艱難、無論如何重大、但軍縮會議第一之目的、亦即最重要之目的、至少應成立一軍備條約、如此、第一步軍縮問題之恊定可以成立、則將來之各段落即易於達到矣、西門未謂、安全問題過於繁複、彼現尙不能加以討論、但各國如能以善隣相安之精神自勉、則一般之信任、必能大加鞏固也、</p>

<p>商界鉅子推銷美棉　中央社記者昨晨往訪榮宗敬氏、據談如次、美棉業已陸續由美起運來華、其第一批棉花、將於日内抵滬、關於美棉抵滬後、一切事務、中央銀行業已成立辦事處、專司其責、至於推銷人員宋部長亦已聘定中國、銀行總經理張公權、上海銀行總經理陳光甫、永安紗廠總經理郭順、及本人等担任、故本人等擬於日内、集商推銷等辦法、至於美棉抵滬後之銷路係一重要問題、蓋年來華商紗廠、因銷路呆滯、生產過剩、相率减工、棉花存積、勢所必然、加之農村經濟已瀕破產、各地現銀、集中上海、各銀行信用放欵、只收不放、以致各地金融現狀、已遠不如前、各埠購買力之薄弱、不獨對美棉爲然、况美棉價格、較高於國產、則銷路成爲問題矣、</p>
<p>華商停止直接訂購　日前外傳華商紗廠、對於美棉均表示不願購買、則非確訊、本市華商紗廠、自宋部長在美簽訂五千萬美金棉麥借欵後、即停止直接向美訂購美棉、蓋各廠均知已有整數美棉運華、不必再向美方訂貨、今後需用美棉、决向政府購買、華商態度、早已表示與政府合作至於日商購買美棉、宋部長亦已言之、凡商業機關出售貨物、難以分别何國商人購買也、</p>
<p>美麥銷售極爲困難　美麥運滬、現尙無確期、際此米價低賤之我國、貴價之美麥運華銷售、更爲困難、且各埠麥粉存貨堆積、滬津兩地、計存達四百餘萬擔、如此鉅量存麥、預計半年方可銷盡、則美麥銷路問題、殊可加以研究也云云、</p>

<p>倫敦特約通信一志寄</p>
<p>七月八日星期六</p>
<p>今日排定四場决賽、直至七時三十分、最後一塲混合雙打决賽、方上中央場、留而觀者已寥寥無幾、天氣仍熱、似有雨意、但僅數點而已、第一塲馬迪夫人對邳德女士、自下午二時改至二時十五分、英王英后於開賽前蒞塲、中央塲人山人海、點點如沙田魚、</p>
<p>事前希望甚高、以爲此英女子有得勝之可能、然此一萬五千之觀衆中、恐無人曾預料比賽之若是接近、馬迪夫人於各四後、以六比四勝第一盤、郎德女士以九比七勝第二盤、在完畢此盤後之情形、言之稍過、球員與觀衆、皆同様之可憐可嘆、秩序旣恢復、比賽繼續後、從未獲見之異常特殊之表演、使觀衆爲之一驚、馬迪夫人用盡各種擊法、得佔先着、以六比三勝第一盤、其足因受傷過劇、在此盤中、比賽幾乎不能繼續、在此賽之初、郎德女士表顯其兩種根本之特色、一爲其流暢之擊法、得使其球幾首永不停頓、二爲以落地球試馬迪夫人、無論成功與否、此戰略大告成功、馬迪夫人在大部份之比賽中、奔走不已、及結局之時、馬迪夫人力與抗禦、落地球亦少功效、</p>
<p>每次情形、皆屬如此、馬迪以六比四勝第一盤後、觀衆以爲次盤將亦一面倒、豈知驚人之事、方興未艾、馬迪先發球、繼續得勝其發球、至成六比六、兩人皆疲極不堪、郎德女士精神、似乎較佳、其擊法亦較多變化、正抽有力、反抽可　、時時準備上網、試以壓球、馬迪夫人自始迄終、站立底線、擊不殊用心、落點亦甚佳、較少力量耳、卽於六比六之前、其出球、更其發球、漸漸軟弱、於第十三局中、觸網不下四五次、結果其發球局失敗、不幸之慘劇、於次局發生、郎德以三十一四十落後、其一記抽球擊出界線三四時外、視線員視若無睹、馬迪夫人相視大驚、但卽表示完全願意接受此判决、此時裁判員表示意見、謂馬迪夫人應勝此分、事後據謂裁判員以爲視線員曾呼出界、視線員忽自椅起立、往裁判員處、告以其判决决不可更改、討論移時、發球線之視線員、亦參加其間、同時馬迪夫人退往塲後之木板旁等候、面現倉皇而不穏郎德女士亦然、此必須明瞭者、如郎德之球、作爲出界、則馬迪得勝此局、成七比七、最後裁判員聲明、郎德應勝此分、而此局分數、成爲平等、郎德發球、馬迪連連失誤、郎德遂八比六勝此盤、</p>
<p>比賽遂從此次不能回後平態、兩人皆陷於慌亂、一記自郎德而來之落地球、馬迪夫人未往回答、無論自發球及回球之後、馬迪皆僅進至底線内數呎、極温和回以高球至郎德塲内、有時試以落地球無意中獲勝、在二比三時、郎德發球雙誤、觀衆閔然、馬迪遂以四比二佔先、但仍不似一將得勝者、因其似乎不能行動、卽近在數碼内之球、亦放棄不答、一次試欲回答一邊線球、失足而仆地、繼而發球又出界、郎德遂勝此局、其結局、則郎德女士連連觸網、馬迪夫人以六比三完結、馬迪之堅决與善能變化、大受稱賞、</p>
<p>鮑羅屈於與勃善寗之保持雙打錦標、已早預料但經過亦頗費事、在最後數塲中、曾失敗數盤對克培與法瓜生時、曾居連失二盤之下風、但鮑羅屈拉　恢復其原態、而回復平衡、勃魯寗全局俱佳、從而輔佐之、對佐藤布井、先失一盤、後擊敗之、在此挫折中、鮑勃二人努力奮鬥、雙方皆表演精彩、鮑爲砲兵隊之領袖、球擊入觀座之中、勃之守衛、則如石壁一座、然在必須時、亦能進攻、且常常得分、在對方佐藤布井更兇狠、其球之落點、更爲巧妙、但其缺點則爲不守其位置、以致爲敵所乘、布井較活潑、亦富進攻性、　球可觀、發球則尙未盡如人意、旣失二三兩盤後、此一對日本選手、曾奮勇力鬥、然究不能挽救而屈服、</p>
<p>女子雙打决賽、爲一令人欣賞有味之比賽、蘭英女士與瑪底歐夫人得勝、蘭英女士之名、已第十次見於此項之優勝名表上、傑姆斯與約克兩女士、對此兇猛之對敵、全失效用、但在第二盤中、曾力戰而以十一比九獲勝、第三盤又以三比一佔先、似乎有望、傑姆斯之發球失敗、蘭瑪終以六比四勝第三盤</p>
<p>傑姆斯女士富有雙打之天才、其攔劈壓殺、大受觀者不絕之鼓掌、約克女士除發球外、並不稍讓於傑、雖較其搭配稍差、但亦善奔走與壓殺、兩人皆精巧非常、觀之愜意、其戰略亦彷彿第一流者、其主要之差異、約克爲一天然之前塲球員、然兩人交換位置、亦殊敏速、蘭英女士拍對球抽、凶猛可怕、瑪底歐夫人在後塲生抽、亦有力而致人於死、」在惠勃爾登中、得勝混合雙打錦標而全未失落一盤、爲一有價值之成功、克拉温格夫人與克拉姆、一路擊敗希蘭女士與法瓜生、高弗列夫人與金斯雷、蘭英女士與曼爾等、對希蘭與法瓜生之决賽、已上場甚　、劇戰兩盤、甚長甚久、克拉温格之穏健與克拉姆之全能、使其得勝而歸、（全文已完）</p>

<h3 id="c204">秋的組合 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>莫怪世人要悲秋吧。但看，秋的組合成字，總没有一個好字面，倉頡老子已按下了風水，這有甚麽可說！</p>
<p>不信，我且來舉幾個例：秋在心上，是個愁悶的愁；秋在鳥上，是歷史上所說；「秃鶑啼來」的鶑，鶑不是好鳥。秋在人旁，是没人偢倸的偢，西廂記上說；「他不偢人待怎生」？偢不是好看待。偢不是好看待。秋在目旁，是惡很之瞅他一瞅的瞅，瞅不是好眼色；秋在手旁，是一把揪住了的揪，秋不是好手勢；秋在金旁，是貪官汚吏掘地皮的鐵鍬，鍬不是好傢伙；秋在口旁，是「天陰鬼哭聲啾啾一的啾，啾不是好聲音；秋在水旁，是地方湫隘的湫，湫不是好塲所。秋在魚旁，是一條　泥　的鍬，鍬不是好魚　。總而言之、無</p>
<p>論怎様的組合，要在秋字組成的字裡，尋出一個，堂皇，富麗，快樂，舒暢的字様；任憑你翻破種種新舊的字典，有麽？没有，簡直没有。</p>
<p>要是說到一句：「一年容易又秋風，」七字裏面，就包含着一種悲凉的意思。換了一個春字，那麽「一年容易又春風，」便有「萬象回春」的希望，一些不覺得悲凉了。所以，國家多事，不必定在秋天；然而，總說一句：「多事之秋」。國家多難，也不必定在秋；然而，總說一句：「多難之秋」。試在各種成語裡面，要翻出一句「多難之夏，」或「多事之夏，」有麽？没有，簡直没有！</p>
<p>從事實上觀起，國恥紀念，大都在五月裡，分明是多難之夏，和多事之夏；但，九一八的奇恥發生，而「多事之秋」和「多難之秋」，居然由成語而化爲事實，這是多麽不幸的事！</p>
<p>九一八的紀念，已過了旬日，但，請民衆不要忘却了多事之秋，和多難之秋。</p>
<h3 id="c205">高昌司 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 傅翼之</p>
<p>這大槪是高昌司出巡吧？</p>
<p>肅靜，廻避，監察司，永寗侯，高昌司等的一塊塊的團牌，由紅衣人托在肩上雁行般的跨過横馬路進了；接着是腰束繡花緞帶頭戴紅高帽的同胞，各持着一面嵌有「廚快」兩字的方旗跨過去了；跟在他們屁股底的，又是兩個一排的紅頂子，白綢衫，喬其紗褂，托着銅香爐的紳士先生們；再過去是十番鑼鼓隊；殿後的，聽說是高昌司，而在高昌司前面行的這一班同胞，大槪就是高昌司的僚屬，侍衛等的現身吧？</p>
<p>「老爺來哉，停歇開！」</p>
<p>高昌司峨冠朝服，坐在一乘四個人扛的框裏，看來好威風！當他的神轎正要横過馬路的時候，左邊駛來一輛卡車，右邊又來一部擠滿乘客的電車，他的隨來的香爐弟子，惟恐他們有犯神威，便這様急遽的吆喝着，終於電車和卡車都停住了。</p>
<p>高昌司的前身究竟是誰，我不是歷史學者，又没有翻過上海縣誌（也許這縣誌可以查考），抛磚引玉，只有敬候考據家的明敎；但因高昌司這様神氣十足地招搖過市，不禁使我想起了江西的兩尊搠霉頭的大仙佛來：</p>
<p>一個歷史上有名的抱朴子的作者晋朝葛洪，在江西鉛山縣的葛仙山，（山以人名）上有他的一座巍峨的廟宇，附近七八縣的人民，在每年八月間上山進香的，不下十餘萬，相傳香客的齋戒不潔，每在山上給他誅殛得半死半活，然近來他的廟宇却會給一般所謂「亂民」的，燒個精光；還有一個就是唐武宗時由淮南節度使入相的李德裕，在上饒的靈山登仙，每年上山朝拜他的不少於葛洪，而在旱年的祈雨，便非接到這位李老眞人（仙號）不可，據說：前年也給共黨把他的廟宇燒掉。</p>
<p>同様是一尊仙佛，因所在的地方不同，便見彼此遭遇的差異，難道神也有幸不幸的嗎？而偶像之不值崇拜，當可從此恍然，何文明的上海人竟如此執迷呢</p>

<p>— 汪瑩月</p>
<p>星期六夜，叨客樓密斯李的光，帶我到伊每晚要玩的跳舞廳去，我的心雖然有些自漸形穢的顫抖着在躊躇，兩條腿却像願意去探險的跟伊走到目的地。</p>
<p>舞廳四周的環境十分靜穆，絲毫没有喧囂的都市空氣。彩色的玻璃電管從黄泥似的短牆上反映下來，把我的白襯衫泛了淺紫色。對面馬路邊，停駛着十來輛新漆汽車。門口有幾個銅鈕扣白帆布制服的小Boy和看門巡警在逗笑。</p>
<p>跨進大門，是個草靑木綠的花園，在夜色的籠罩下，景緻特别宜人。從門口有一條環抱的路徑直達舞廳，舞廳的周圍都見玻瑙砌成，晶明透澈，得使人留戀。</p>
<p>舞廳裏團團坐着許多美麗的少女，鬈的髮，黑的眉，紅的唇，高聳的乳，玉色的臂，酥軟的腿，誘人似的充滿其間，七八個神經已經麻木的靑年，烏溜溜的眼睛像探海燈一般在探望。</p>
<p>柳楊的音樂開始了，全廳祇留着綠沈沈的醉人的燈光，那男的女的也紛紛離了坐位，他與伊伊與伊，一雙雙都緊貼的擁抱着，隨了音樂的節調在中間往來旋轉！旋轉！旋轉！</p>
<p>他們與伊們精神確是有些興奮了，不過這興奮是深含了無聊的色彩！時間是一刻一刻飛逝過去，他們還是一次一次的擁抱着，活像傀儡般没有一些人生的情感。</p>
<p>「人間天堂！」我有些倦意了，從有爾喬亞似的公子哥兒享樂窟裏逃出來，這様輕輕的嘆羨着。</p>
<p>自然界的凉風掃清了我滿身染來的人造香，孤零地走回家已是十一點了。</p>

<p>第十六回　　酸楚襟懷當前還祝福　　倥偬戎馬暗裏突移軍</p>
<p>桂枝對我說，我爲了飯碗，不敢得罪哥哥，認我是個勢利薫心的人。可是到了他自己呢，他就可以丢了患難朋友，去嫁現任的連長了。一個連長，也不過是起碼小軍官，這有什麽了不得。他想到了這裏，情不自禁的，揑了拳頭，就在棹上一搥。店伙正兩手捧了咖啡杯子，要向桌上放下來，聽到卜通一下響，將杯子裏的水濺蕩得滿瓷碟子。身子向後一縮，望着積之發了呆。積之自己，立刻也就省悟過來了。便笑道：你們是新開不到一年的，舖子，爲什麽這桌子，也是搖搖不定。店伙這才知道，原來人家是替自己整理桌子，這倒是自己錯怪了人了。於是帶了微笑，將咖啡杯子放在桌上，可是他那雙眼睛，依然對着他不住的偷看。積之見白糖塊罐子，放在桌子中間，於是用銅夾子，夾了一塊糖到杯子裏，又夾一瑰糖到杯子裏去，自己的一雙眼睛，却射過糖罐子以外去。全身都麻木了，不知所云。偶然一低頭，却看到咖啡杯子裏放的糖塊，已經伸出水外來，咖啡裏面放了這些個糖，却應該甜到什麽程度麽？於是一看面前無人，就將杯子裏的糖塊，向外挑了出去。自己原是打算挑出來，放到托杯子的瓷碟子裏去的。兩隻眼睛，却望到對面墻上一張點心價目表。及至把那價目表看光了更是糟透了，原來都把連渣帶汁的一些糖水，舀到一碟子鷄蛋糕裏面去了。這眞是糟糕，店伙來看到，不要說自己是發了神經病嗎？回頭一看，店伙並不在這裏就冷不妨的，將這碟子鷄蛋糕把盂子裏倒。他剛倒完畢，店伙也就來了。（二○○）</p>

<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>一朶嬌艶的鮮花，當其含苞初放，芳香馥郁，最容易招引一般浪蝶游蜂的拈惹。但是，經不起雨打風吹，那花兒就要萎謝零落咧。這時候的蜂蝶，早已飛向别枝去，再不會來憑弔與惋惜了。</p>
<p>一個美麗的好女子，在伊靑春年少的時光，恰與一朶鮮花相似。但是伊那純潔的意志，經不起異性的追求，虚榮的誘惑，最容易走入歧途。一旦容顔老去，聲名狼藉，宛似經過風雨的鮮花，前塵如夢，不堪回首了！</p>
<p>現在的一輩摩登女性，在没有嚐到那種苦味的時候，正是同醉酒般地同異性狂歡取樂，談戀說愛，說不盡風光。豈知好夢不常，等到對方目的達到，早就棄之如遺，不屑一顧。這時候伊雖悲哀與痛苦，追悔也來不及了。</p>
<p>將於十月一日在新光大戲院開映的明星公司新片「殘春，」狠可以作當今摩登女性的借鏡。劇中的金梅麗（東方標準美人徐來女士飾）是一位十足的摩登姑娘，但是伊的結果是服毒，犧牲。</p>
<p>摩登的姑娘們，須緊記着靑春是最容易蹉跎的，快些把空抛在享樂與談愛的時間，來努力於社會事業吧！浪費靑春，到頭祇使你如落花流水，不可收拾，「殘春」裏的金梅麗，就是最好的敎訓。</p>

<p>笑一笑，少一少，笑，　乎開胃健神，有益於人的事。不過引人發笑，却也是一件難事。第一，像灘　中的那種俚俗粗話，固然和影戲裏面的便桶當帽子，便壼酒的壼的一般不入上流。還有一種，自己以爲可笑極了，可是話還没有出口，自己却先放聲大笑，在這帶笑帶喘的講述中，憑你講得好，也不過使人們聽了，皮笑肉不笑，裝出一個勞萊般的尶𡯓面孔。所�</p>

<p>烏龜熟讀三國</p>
<p>在一家宴會席上，一個歡喜多說話的朋友，大講其野話。他說一個說小書的挖苦說大書的一段話，那一天是北極大帝張天君的生日，他吩咐手下龜蛇二將說，凡是來祝壽的神仙，如有犯酒色財氣的戒條者，一律擋駕。二將奉了大帝之命，鎭守山門。不多時候，一位神仙駕雲而來，蛇將見是呂洞賓，忙上前擋駕，將天学諭言，說了一遍。呂仙問我何以犯了四戒，蛇將答道，你三醉岳陽樓，係犯的酒戒，三戲白牡丹，係犯的色戒，指石成金，劍斬黄龍，係犯的財氣兩戒。四戒俱犯，怎能祝壽。呂仙聽了悻悻而去。隔了一會，關帝跨着赤兎馬，手提靑龍刀，一馬馳來。龜將見了，忙也上前擋駕，向關帝宣着大帝口諭。關帝聽了，撚着長髥，呌龜將說出所犯條例來。龜將當也侃侃說道，十日一大宴，五日一小宴，係犯的酒戒，上馬一錠金，下馬一錠銀，係犯的財戒，月下斬貂蟬，五關斬六將，係犯的財色兩戒，關公不等他說完，臥蠶眉竪，丹鳳眼睜，手執大刀，怒聲喝道，「你隻烏龜，三國倒說得這般爛熟。」某君說到這裏，還表演作勢，自鳴得意。一個幽默家聽了，忽請某君將關帝的話，復述一遍。某又大聲說道。你隻烏龜，倒熟讀三國，可是闔座的笑聲，突然大發，但某却猶洋洋得意哩。</p>

<p>某敎員在講歷史課，講到井田制度的時候，他侃侃地說是井田制是在每畦田的中央，鑿一口井來，遇着旱年，就可汲着井中的水，灌溉田畝，不致像臨渴掘井，無法挽救。某學生聽了，起立發言道：照先生這話看來，井田旣是這般解釋，那麽書中「刀兵」二字，定也是每一個兵，各吃一刀，兵旣殺盡，莫怪天下要大亂了。某敎授聽了，竟瞠目不知所答。</p>

<p>蘇州有位愛國靑年，他在一二八恊議停戰後，曾决心北上，出關抗日。他在同時發出許多信札，向友人來告他抗日决心。可是他在祖餞後的若干日，兀是還膩在姊妹淘裏，並不出發。於是一班祖餞他的友人，却向他請問何日起程。靑年聽了，悽悽惶惶的道：我久已預備出發了，可是捨不得這裏的女人。朋友們聽了，都道：「那邊不是也有女人的麽？你也儘可去追求麽！那靑年的態度，更悽惶了他黯然說道：「但那邊的女人，怎會知道我是愛國的靑年呢」！</p>

<p>一位吝嗇的朋友，他的香烟，大都是在朋友處拿來，從不出錢購買的。有一天，他又從朋友處揩油到一根香烟，吸了幾口，因有别的事兒，不能吸烟了，可是那長長的一橛香烟屁股，他怎肯白白的犧牲，於是他把那屁股，在檯邊上，熄了火，就藏入他一向儲烟的内衣袋裏。那知這段烟尾，餘火未盡，竟重行燃燒起火，和袋中原有的二枚烟尾，一起發出縷縷白烟，等到那位朋友發覺，早已火星直冒，不可收拾。好容易撲滅之後，已是袋穿衣碎，有一個滑稽家見他那種啼笑皆非的面孔，向他打趣道：你的袋裏開烟廠了，以後可以不必再向人討香烟吃哩！在别人大笑中，那位朋友的面孔，更加好看了。</p>

<p>— 豐之餘</p>
<p>達一先生在「文統之夢」裏，因劉勰自謂夢隨孔子，乃始論文，而後來做了和尚，遂譏其「貽羞往聖」。其實是中國自南北朝以來，凡有文人學士，道士和尙，大抵以「無特操」爲特色的。晉以來的名流，每一人總有三種小玩意；一是「論語」和「孝經」，二是「老子），三是「維摩詰經」，不但採作談資，並且常常做一點註解。唐有三敎辯論，後來變成大家打譂；所謂名儒，做幾篇伽藍碑文也不算什麽大事。宋儒道貌儼然，而竊取禪師的語錄。清呢，去今不遠，我們還可以知道儒者的相信「太上感應篇」和「文昌帝君陰隲文」，並且會請和尙到家裏來拜懺。</p>
<p>耶穌敎傳入中國，敎徒自以爲信敎，而敎外的小百姓却都呌他們是「吃敎」的。這兩個字，眞是提出了敎徒的「精神」，也可以包括大多數的儒釋道敎之流的信者，也可以移用於許多「吃革命飯」的老英雄。</p>
<p>清朝人稱八股文爲「敲門磚」，因爲得到功名，就如打開了門，磚即無用。近年則有雜誌上的所謂主張。「××評論」之出盤，不是爲了迫壓，倒因爲這派作者的飛騰；「新月」的冷落，是老社員都「爬」了上去，和月亮距離遠起來了。這種東西，我們爲要和「敲門磚」區别，稱之爲「上天梯」罷。</p>
<p>「敎」之在中國，何嘗不如此。講革命，彼一時也；講忠孝，又一時也，跟大拉嘛打圈子，又一時也，造塔藏主義，又一時也。有宜於專吃的時代，則指歸應定於一尊，有宜合吃的時代，則諸敎亦本非異致，不過一碟是全鴨，一碟是雜拌兒而已。劉勰亦然，蓋僅由「不撒薑食」一變面爲吃齋。於胃臟裏的分量原無差别，何况以和尙而注「論語」「孝經」或「老子」，也還是不失爲一種「天經地義的呢？</p>

<p>— 子展</p>
<p>予於蘧廬絮語論四川人與鴉片一文中，已舉晚唐蜀人雍陶詩爲證，謂遠在李唐，中國已有鴉片矣。頃又於全唐詩第十二函第八册，見李貞白詠罌粟子云：</p>
<p>倒排雙陸子，希插碧牙籌。</p>
<p>旣似犧牛乳，又如鈴馬兜。</p>
<p>鼓槌並瀑箭，直是有來由。</p>
<p>予謂唐時中國人已有種鴉片者，此亦一證也。武唷幹鴉片戰爭史云，中外鴉片貿易，在鴉片戰爭以前已行之有年。在唐貞元時即有自阿拉伯商人輸入罌粟者。蕭一山清代通史，陳懷清史要略，同持此說，未知何據。舊唐書西戎傳，拂菻國，乾封二年遣使獻底也伽，或疑底也伽即罌粟，亦未知是否。清儒俞正變癸已類稿，引唐譯毘奈耶雜事律，略謂有病者吸烟，以兩碗相合，底上穿孔，中著火置藥，以鐵管長十二指，置孔吸之。第未知當時印度鴉片是否與佛經同入中國。旣以宗敎麻醉我中國人之精神，復以鴉片麻醉我中國人之肉體，紅頭××之流毒中國，豈僅今之洋塲大埠，爲虎作倀者流而已哉！</p>
<h3 id="c233">讀「狂人日記」 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>偶然整理舊書，無意間翻出了八年前買的一本「呐喊」。</p>
<p>血紅的書面，雖然有些黯澹，但牠的精神似乎是不能磨滅的，翻開來一看，依舊一個一個</p>
<p>字都像用刀刻在木上的一様。</p>
<p>懷舊的情緒被喚起了。我不知不覺的執着書，讀了下去。我很想看看現在這一個時代，是否和書中所描寫的那個時代，有幾分相似之點。換一句話說，便是「呐喊」中的時代環境，有没有過去。</p>
<p>第一篇便是「狂人日記」。</p>
<p>「狂人日記」裡的那個狂人，疑心他周圍的人都想吃他，並且從各方面引出種種證據來證明他們都是些吃人的人，甚至連趙貴翁家的狗看了他兩眼也不能放心。八年前初讀這篇作品時，只覺得書中那個狂人神經過敏得可笑而又可憐。但現在，我却不能笑了，我只能把嚴肅的眼光注視在書上。</p>
<p>無疑地，時代也曾把我拉進書中，使我成爲和這「狂人日記」中的狂人相似的人。我還很清楚的記得，在這「呐喊」到我手裡來的後一年。時代是怎様的把我迫害着。在我的周圍，不論是家庭裡，或是社會上，到處者充滿了想吃我的人，想吃我的眼光。那時候，我也曾含着淚，燒掉我所心愛的書籍，含着淚，逃到外面去過流亡的生活，眞的連一隻狗看了我兩眼都覺得害怕，僥倖我的八字生得還好，竟能從這些吃人的人的牙齒縫裡漏出來。但回頭一看另一些「生不逢辰」被吃人的人吃掉連屍骨都不吐出來的靑年，不禁怵目驚心，倒抽了一口冷氣。</p>
<p>一直到現在，雖然是度着另一種生活的我，也還覺得身旁滿是吃人的人一様。偶然出門去，踏上一部電車或者公共汽車留心一看，周圍的人全臉生横肉，虎視耽耽，彷彿恨不得把我囫圇呑下似的，使我的心止不住勃勃的亂跳。</p>
<p>便是爲我所尊敬的文壇上，現在也似乎有一角被吃人的人盤據住了。他們有的會公開賣友，有的會化名造謠，陰謀中傷，滿心都想吃了别人的血肉來擴大自己的洋房。使八年前懷着做一個文化運動小卒野心的我，爲之望而却步。</p>
<p>「狂人日記的時代，到底要到什麽時候，纔會過去呢？」望着窗外陰曇的天色，我忍不住這様嘆息了」</p>
<h3 id="c234">旅途雜筆 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 天馬</p>
<p>五·接江者與呌賣者</p>
<p>在這一次旅行中，有兩種人最使我衷心欽敬拜服，也最使我感到麻煩畏懼，那便是接江者與呌賣者。對於這兩種人，一貫地，我是遵依着孔二先生底敬鬼神而遠之」的敎訓。</p>
<p>「接江者」是旅館派來船上接客－不，兜攬生意的專使，而呌賣者則大家都知道那是呌賣零食或某地特產的小販。這兩種人，都具有外交家一般的詞令，戰士般的勇敢，狐狸般的狡猾，猴子般的敏捷，而又還具有牛皮糖般的一股軟勁，無論是誰，只要一經他們看中意，便總得費九牛二虎之力才擺脱得開。</p>
<p>每當船靠埠頭的時候，遠遠地，你便可以望見那一羣英雄們和準備百碼賽跑一様，大家抖擻精神在埠頭上等待着。船一靠岸，便一聲呐喊，和戰士衝上前敵一様，向船上拚命地擠，拚命地奔上來。那種情形，眞好比「水銀瀉地，無孔不入。接着便是「發財旅館呀」，「長江飯店呀」，「鷄蛋呀」，「新花生呀」，儘力地嚷，好像是故意比賽誰的聲音大，誰的勁兒足，於是船上便立刻擁擠煩囂鬧成一團糟。</p>
<p>假如這時你的房門没有關上，而且你也想看一看門外的喜劇，立刻，英雄們便會來到你的面前，先是一個和氣的笑臉，然後柔聲地說：「先生，又來了嗎？還是住到我們那邊去，好吧？價錢公道，招待周到，先生又是老主顧，……」這様一來，眞會使你受寵若驚，而又無話可答。不管你是否到過這個埠頭，他總是一口咬定你是他們的老主顧，不管你是否上岸，他總是勸你落他們的客棧，這様，好容易，一個走了，一個又來，話都是這一套，而人各盡其妙。這時候，你雖說會感到麻煩，但你却决不會不衷心欽服他們的才幹。</p>
<p>在接江者走開之後，呌賣者便又緊接着來了，也是先來一個笑臉，再唱一遍他所有的貨色的花名，然後一件一件拿到你的眼前。比如那是賣蕪湖乾子的罷，他便會說：「瞧，這乾子多好。又香，又嫩，帶點回去，旣好自家吃，又好送人情，上轉先生不是買了一兩百嗎？老主顧，這次再買些罷！」推而至於賣南京板鴨的或是賣九江磁器的，話總歸是這麽一套，尤其每一個人都一定會認定你是他的老主顧，上次你買了許多，這次就有再買的「義務」。這様，也是一個走了，再來一個，無論你搖頭，你滿口不要，甚至駡聲呌他滾開，他還是那様和顔悦色，還是那様誠懇地向你勸告，直到你接受了他底勸告，或是你拍的一聲使勁把門關上。</p>
<p>對於這兩種英雄，我從來不敢領敎，船剛要靠埠，我老早便把門關上，只敢在窗户裏張望，於是英雄們對於我也似乎同抱有「可望而不可卽」的憤慨！</p>
<p>我想，當前年九一八禍變爆發時，假如我們還派了這兩種人材去日内瓦籲請援救，大槪列强决不會和今日一様袖手旁觀罷！</p>
<h3 id="c235">三等車中（續） <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 巴金</p>
<p>火車在細雨濛濛中離開了浦口，時候是十一點鐘。我没有留我的脚跡在南京，我是有遺憾的。在南京我有好幾個朋友，我本應該去看看他們，本應該分出一些時間來留着和他們在一起度過，但雨把我阻止了。尤其使我掛念的是那一個染着不洽之疾的朋友和他的夫人。他最近還寫信給我說：「你的心靈的純潔與偉大，生活的灑脱和輕鬆，只要在我得到一刻沈靜的時候，我便追懷着你：我是漸埋漸深地成了一個泥人了。我常常希望着因爲我有痼疾而早點結束了我的生命。」去年我在北平承他欵待了我一個多星期，和他在一張床上度過了那些夜晚，聽了他許多次的咳聲和夢囈，我留下了在頣和園買來的一對石球在那間公寓的小屋裏就走了。我帶走的他的印象到現在還没有褪色，依舊是去年那様地鮮明：心靈的純潔與偉大，只有他纔可以受這個評語。但没有人了解過他。他如今是在艱苦的生活的鬥爭裏，社會的輕蔑的眼光下面一天天地衰弱下去了。每次我讀着他的混合着血和淚的散文，我的全個心靈都被攪亂了。我常常在心裏狂呌着：他是不能夠死的，他應該活下去，强健起來，去享受生活裏的幸福。</p>
<p>我的思想像車輪那様地轉動着。雨却漸漸地小了。到了一個站，雨就完全住了。天氣依舊不好。我的心上的重壓也没有减輕。但火車又向前開行了，就像一個怒吼着的饑餓的猛獸。</p>
<p>車裏的客人並不多，好些座位都空着，一個人可以佔據一把椅子，車是新的，油漆的顔色很明亮，而且洗刷得很乾凈。有百葉窗。這些使得對面的一個老客人不時地發出了驚訝的讚歎。</p>
<p>天氣後來變好了，太陽從雲裏露出面來。車窗外有樹木，有田野，有山，但我時時刻刻都記着我是往北方走了。</p>

<h3 id="c236">熱情的小孩（二） <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 哥茫與賽作鑄瑛譯</p>
<p>而這清脆美妙的聲音，就是說着極其微細的事情，也含有一種嘸媚：「敎父，要不要把你的長椅搬到廊下呢？」她談着巴黎，她談着展覽會和聳立在塞納河邊的一些白色的宮殿。如果能夠到這地方去頑頑，那一定是非常快樂的事情啊，於是他便夢想着那壯麗到使人不能相信的神奇的城市。他希望和她一路到那兒去。</p>
<p>「可是如果這事使你高興的話，好孩子，星期日午飯後你來好了。白德祇有四天可以陪我們頑的；我們可以坐車到綠林去游一游。」</p>

<p>羅哲神思異常不安起來了。他連東西都不愛吃，他的祖母責備他不該和肚皮生氣，責備他不該任情使氣。他不餓，但他又並没有病痛；一種潛伏在身體裡面的寒熱在養着他。他焦急地等着星期日的到來。他跑到那充滿着薔薇花香的聖珂安公園去夢想。他編出一些非常温柔的歌曲，好像這種音樂是從他的心坎裡發出來的一様。他做出許多他自己覺得美麗到使人流淚的詩句：</p>
<p>天空好像藍色的緞子，</p>
<p>充滿着野薔薇香的五月</p>
<p>傾下一些珍珠在手飾匣裡！</p>
<p>在那些紫玟瑰的花心裡……</p>
<p>而這詩是以一個重複的句子完結的：天空好像藍色的緞子！詩人曾經寫過比這還鮮艶，還新頴的東西嗎？他相信是没有的。他得到一些大胆的比喻：「我的心裏開了一些丁香花。」他覺得他的靈魂裏面有了一種不可思議的曙光。</p>
<p>天眞的他，自己不安地問着：「但我究竟怎麽的？難道我要生病嗎？我像害猩紅熱以前一様有着一點寒熱。」可是不對，他旣然覺得幸福！幸又不幸混在一塊，他簡直弄昏了；因爲以前他的生活是那様安寗，那様平靜。爲什麽當她的櫻唇間透露出潔白如雪的牙齒，優美地笑着時，他會戰慄呢？爲什麽他急於要再看見她呢？三天前，他還一點也不認識她的。以前，他也曾疼愛他的媽媽，他的姑母，可是他從來不曾有過現在這種感覺。爲着她，他願意把他所有的一切都貢獻出來；不錯，他是一無所有，或差不多一無所有；除開一本漂亮的印着一些蜂雀的插畫的年禮書之外，他没有一様東西值得她愛的，但這本漂亮的書藏在書櫃内，並且他如果把牠送給她，姑母便會要不高興的。</p>
<p>前天他曾想過要買些蕓花送她，但無疑的，這一定是可笑的舉動。並且，打開他的小荷包一看，那裡面祗有六個蘇（Sou一佛郎的二十分之一），於是他感着從來不曾有過的貧窮的悲哀。</p>

<h3 id="c237">致思想　穆因 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>明知道前面是斷崖絕壁，而甘作冒險，以求僥倖於一擲之間的，這或者是所謂勇敢的人．明知道前面有虎狼，陷阱，而能夠毅然回頭，拿得起，放得下，那也許是聰明的人．惟獨踟蹰在人生道上，徘徊在十字街頭，感覺進不能，退不得的，那才是可憐而又平凡的人呢！</p>
<p>我徬徨，我苦悶，只因多了些平凡的思想。</p>
<p>思想！我爲你受了奈何的惆悵，我爲你感了莫名的悲哀，我爲你咽盡了人世的苦辣，憧憬着，思考着，夢幻着……呵！不堪提起！</p>
<p>靈海中點點的波濤，形成了宇宙間的酒杯，儘有許多平凡而又可憐的人在其中沉淪，傷感；然而擾攘的原因，不就是爲着你麽？</p>
<p>有一個時候，我願獻身於武裝隊裏，聽千軍萬馬的狂呼，看猩風戰血的悲壯，苗沛霖滿江紅詞說得好：</p>
<p>「匹馬西風，幾踏遍關山夜月！看今夜霜花掌大，征衣似鐵，逸興頌辭陶令菊，雄心待咽蘇卿雪！嘆江南北盡沉淪，紅羊刧。</p>
<p>情不惜，妻孥别！心不爲功名熱！祇隨身兵法，孫吳幾葉，猛虎山中行就縛，妖星天未看將滅；趁秋波挽袖浣羅袍，沙塲血！」</p>
<p>念到這裏不禁雄心萬丈，便欲拔雞起舞，想起：一旦馬革裹屍，殺人遍野；黄沙碧血，浩蕩蕩，蒼莽莽；悲歌慷慨，又何非一時之豪傑，又何嘗不是將來的先烈！</p>
<p>有一個時候，想到人生虚幻，朝露行雲，天地悠悠，更無終古，不禁萬念都灰，愴然涕下，立刻希冀能悄然以遁，淡然以隠，一灣蘆荻；數行衰柳，優游於山空水靜之鄕，聽斷猿之悲哽，看沙鷗兮往來，肅然意遠，無歲月，無營擾，也是世上的神仙，又何懼乎伯人駡聲「消極」！</p>
<p>還有一個時候，我想用毒酒將我麻醉，忘記了宇宙的我，世上的人；忘記了黑暗；忘記了醜惡；忘記了苦恫。一切，只有狂笑，没有哭泣！其名曰「頽廢！」亦「摩登」之一訣！</p>
<p>更有一個時候，我願迎合社會，屈抑人生，戴上骷髏的鬼臉，裝作媚人的假笑，去玩弄一切；不管所遇的是赤心，仰當頭的冷水！只有玩笑，只有奸刁，還有一些兒熱！那怕被人駡作「文丐」的訛話與行气。</p>
<p>然而，我是一個靑年，一個具有鮮紅血肉的靑年，旣是不願綿纏偷生，更不願蜿蜒去死；它爲會我頽廢，它會令我願狂，但是，思想！你在事實上所給予我的，又都是些什麽？應做的事業。</p>

<p>故鄕，又踏上整整離别五年的故鄕了。這裏，一切與五年前是有很少的異様：狹巷似的成年舖滿了厚厚一層爛泥漿的破裂的石板的街，仍然是那様的陰暗，一陣一陣隠隠地散佈出的一種醺人心脾的特有氣味，倒好像是濃厚了些！招市，横牌還是那様遮了天日的低低地懸掛着，只是顔色都剝退了。在白　裏，街頭上　　　是閒　　無　無　的朋友們，大槪都不盡是五年前的那些下巴上蓄了寸來長的鬍子而時時刻刻在抓弄着的伯伯們了（眞的，假使我的神經過敏些，我要懷疑他們那些蓄鬍子的「伯伯」都呑了返老還童的仙丹，一下子陡然漂亮起來了！）：他們像是誰家的哥兒少爺，多半是靑年的小夥子，有的提着鳥籠，嘴角含了雪茄，口裏「龍的洞」的在哼着，有，穿了拖到脚後跟的大褲管的黑綢褲子，高而綳硬的領的白小紡長衫，也有着了筆挺的西裝，頭髮分得油光烏黑的　　　　　××女中的　　　　　，氣味最　，石板最破裂的一條最狹而店最多的街上，他們的踪跡最　，而且還是成了羣結着隊的，他們在互相熱烈地指手劃脚，擠眼弄眉的向同路着黑短裙白反領衫的女學生們嘰哩咕嚕的嘻皮調笑的評論着，他們還會向對方打着流利的從上海學回的洋涇浜英語，雖說對方短髮掩蓋下的黑眼珠子并不曾向他們轉動一下子，拖長了的臉蛋兒也没有浮着一絲絲的笑意而只是隠伏着的怒和窘，他們亦没曾顧慮到自己脚底下的爛泥漿會要濺　了他們日日要穿在身上的高而綳硬的領的小白紡長衫的後擺，或是筆挺的西裝的褲脚，他們只是追逐，没命地比吃飯還緊張還認眞地在追逐着。除了這些數不清無憂無慮像是誰家哥兒少爺們的靑年小夥子以外、能夠在衎頭横衝直撞的當然要算我們的　皮帶着白灰色制服或灰色制服的眞正老</p>

<p>牌老爺了，</p>
<p>許許多多的商店裏，吹鼓手們把洋鼓洋號洋笛子，没有停息地成天鼓漲了嘴巴吹奏着，店堂裏也果然進進出出的擠滿了人，雖說店員學徒們把貨物忙亂地搬動着，呌喚着，熱鬧極了！而錢櫃桌上的先生們倒有的把銅框眼鏡脱下來擱在盛筆硯的木盤裏，低着微微幌擺的頭，幽閒安靜地慢慢在八行紙上寫着家信，有的摟着眼睛，瞌睡瞇瞇地。至於說洋錢互敲着音樂，算盤珠撥動的拍子，那眞是太稀少高貴而不大輕易聽着的了。</p>
<p>爲着要嘗嘗家鄕的土味，竟獨自興致地跑到一家號稱城裏最大最出名的好館子呌××春裏來吃晚飯，剛走進店堂，見每張桌子上是坐滿了人，堂倌肩上披着一條油光烏黑的毛巾怱忙地招呼我「樓上雅座」，於是我也未意識地登上雅座的樓來。呵，我的天，紅的臉，爆的筋，赤露的膊敞開的衣，拳在划着，嘴裏喝着，嚼着，哈哈着，堂倌這桌那桌兩條腿不停息的奔馳着，呼應；酒肉，骨頭，汗，唾沫，聲音已經滿堂的鬧成了模糊的一片了！那裏還有我入座分兒和空隙？走到另一家來，一様的！再一家，仍是一様！二等的，三等的，起碼的，亦都是同様地滿座了屬於它的等級内的大咀大嚼的顧客！我，一個才從他鄕作了遠客歸來的游子，大槪是不會有誰來注意而讓一席地了。於是我决心跑到遠近馳名的「×記老×房」來買乾糧。可是，天呀！這多的人頭，呌我這個陌生的人怎麽擠得上去？横了心，「上△香村去！」眞的，這邊人是果然鬆些，但在「四兩瓜子」，「半斤酥糖」，「兩條條糕」，和「一百鈿五香豆」之類的接二連三的「老主顧」爭先恐後地買畢之後，才輪着一位圓圓而笑嘻嘻的臉上密掛着汗珠子的夥計拿給我兩個說是「從上海沙利文辦來的又香又甜」的麫包。這一次，等待的時間，一個鐘頭没有，四十五分鐘的紀錄，大槪是不會打破的。</p>
<p>……這些事，只要是肯向我這故鄕的街頭上一跑，無論誰都會看得見的，是啊，故鄕，陰暗爛泥的狹街的故鄕，已經變成了提鳥籠，着高硬領長衫，筆挺西裝，跟着女學生調笑評論的像是誰家哥兒少爺們的靑年小夥和横衝直撞背皮帶穿灰色或白色制服的老爺的世界了，其餘的就是：紅臉爆筋赤膊敞衣的吃客，肩上披着烏油光手巾奔馳呼應的堂倌，和糖食店裏爭先恐後的老主顧和掛滿了汗珠的小夥計。再其次：鼓漲着嘴巴成天吹奏着的吹鼓手，把貨物忙亂搬動着的店員學徒，和脱了銅框眼鏡而幽閒安靜地寫家信的帪房先生，以及默　躺着的算盤與絕了跡的洋錢。</p>

<p>爲着籌劃着一筆不可再拖欠下去的房金，我心頭開始很侷促的想：如果連同上月相沿拖下來的房錢，不爽爽氣氣的在這個月裏一併付清，那末二房東勢必要趕我搬塲了吧。看，不是住着大廂房裏的汪家，爲了積欠二個月的原故，一家大小七人，不是給房東太太統統逼着趕跑了嗎？聽說那汪家還是一個老房客，我這裏住了兩年多哩。并且，平日裏他們對待房東全家，彼此感情願爲和睦，絕對没有爭鬧或口角一次，而現在尙且如此，至於我旣夠不上那種老房客的資格，當然更是不必說了。爲的什麽呢？第一我不過僅僅住了四個月來的新房客，對於房東太太們的長談，可說回也没有。就是平素愛護孩子的我，對於他們的孫子，也是不大理會，可以說，壓根兒没有「感情」二字可言。二來是我住着的像斂鴿籠式的亭子間，只要召租條子貼出去，一定有人租去；方便得很，决不會像前樓廂房來得困難。因此，不是很有被「趕跑」的希望嗎？</p>
<p>「啥人？來了。」房門口有人在敲門，應聲進來的便是那位面團團的房東吳太太。</p>
<p>「曾先生，爲啥把門關得緊緊的，不透透空氣呢？」她是從容不迫的這様說。</p>
<p>「是的，我有點兒頭痛。……」</p>
<p>不必說，一看見房東站在我面前，就禁不住要打哆嗦，自然窘得可以，所以只好隨嘴答應着。其實托詞頭痛，也就不是聰明的措詞，假如眞的頭痛的話，打開房門吹吹風，不是更舒服一點嗎？其後她說話了：</p>
<p>「頭痛嗎？小毛病，不要緊的。」</p>
<p>「不過我打算把門關上，睡一會兒哩。」</p>
<p>想不到我還有這等聰明，一時想得出這句話來。</p>
<p>「對了，你睡一會兒罷，等一會兒就會好的。」</p>
<p>「謝謝你！吳太太！請坐一下嗎？」</p>
<p>「好好，不客氣。」她似笑非笑的說：「不過我要麻煩你一下，我想和曾先生相商一椿事啦。」</p>
<p>「好…好…好…」這一下可開口了。還不是要房租嗎？</p>
<p>「聽說你同×報館王先生很相熟，所以要拜托你一點兒哩。」</p>
<p>「什麽事？」</p>
<p>「你看，不是汪家搬走了以後，大廂房空了足足二個多月嗎？若是長次下去，那還了得？要請你替我登一個召租小廣告，大槪可以便宜一點。一說着她馬上從口袋裏掏出一張底稿，上面寫的是：</p>
<p>超等洋房住宅分租，坐落××路××里×號，大廂房一間，衛生設備，一應俱全，合意者請駕臨本宅面洽。吳宅啓</p>
<p>「行行，一定辦到。」</p>
<p>「可以打個對折嗎？」</p>
<p>「吳太太，横豎這張廣告字數不很多，就是不打折扣，對於吳太太又算得了什麽呢？哈哈哈。」於是我想，嘿！只她少抽一筒大烟，可不是就省出了嗎？</p>
<p>「最好是對折囉。隔日登載四天，廣告費請你代我墊一墊，到月底房租裏照扣好了。」</p>
<p>「哦！可是…好的，好的。」</p>
<p>最後，房東出去了，我再關上房門，我重覆的念着「廣告費請代墊一墊…好的…好…」但是，我的錢呢？唉！</p>

<p>二十世紀的科學，眞像雨後春筍的昌盛，可是對於靈魂學，雖經許多靈魂學家極力的研究，試騐，但是，至今却還没有澈底的瞭解，確定一個有無？</p>
<p>我們校裏的一位數理敎授謝××先生，他在課餘，最喜和我們這般玩皮的學生講笑，他所講的，總是些鬼話。什麽鬼呀！靈魂呀！妖精呀！（并非其他神話可比頗含有科學意味的）這一類。膽怯的學生，聽到出神的時候，往往眼前立時現着一個鬼，駭得狂呌飛奔，湧破了我們緊漲而寂靜的空氣。</p>
<p>這次我們又要求他講，他允許把靈魂解說一番給我們聽。我覺得這很有記載的價值，就把他所講的話寫在下面：</p>
<p>人們的身體，包含着無數的細胞，在每一個細胞裏，又含着幾個極微渺的核，人死了之後，身體上好像久用的檯面，有許多小小的孔，細胞裏的核，就從孔裏飛出來，像灰塵的散播在宇宙間，我們就稱牠爲靈子。</p>
<p>靈子的性質，和電子，光子，電視Telivesian的相同。當嬰兒出世的一霎那，牠徧身有許多的巢穴，散布在空間的靈子，就似有吸引力的鑽進去。牠漸漸有聲音會哭了。這様的循環，宇宙間有無量數的靈子散播着。</p>
<p>人間一切的不動物，牠們在世間的時候，環境，出乎當尋常了，那就起一種科學作用，靈子也像歸竅似的鑽進去。靈子有了組織，牠的舉動，好像和人一様了。看到中國的小說上，像聊齋誌說的什麽精怪呀！鬼呀！這書雖然是憑空而說，倒也有點道理。</p>
<p>我們常常聽得人家說，死於非命的現代名人書畫</p>
<p>杜兆楨女史畫（略歷）</p>
<p>杜兆楨女史號小梅乃了</p>

<p>也</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>鬼，爲出現，作祟。（我們坐得緊緊的，目光互相注視着）是的，因爲牠的靈子，在空間還有組織，所以能夠這様。可是時間隔久，也漸漸自與組織而成爲散沙一般了。牠的出現作祟的能力，也漸漸會失掉。反之，死於疾病的鬼，牠的靈子是無組織的，所以作祟的能力，就有也不大。</p>
<p>照竇爾得的原子學說、我們可以明白，靈魂是這様一個東西。</p>
<p>我們的鬼神敎師，祇是透了一口好久没透的氣。我們這顆飄蕩的心也隨着穏定了。</p>
<h3 id="c241">說「觀瞻」炳 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>晨起讀報、得一則小之又小的新聞：</p>
<p>老西門陳英士先烈紀念塔旁，日來發現成羣乞丐，日夜停留該地，殊屬有碍觀瞻。當局有鑒於此，昨特嚴令取締，業已由警立即加以驅逐矣。</p>
<p>本來這事實不足奇，這新聞尤不足奇，在目前的中國，特别是幾個大都會，气丐之多，適與時俱進，旣多之後，即不滋生事故，到底是垢首濫衣腹空如洗的不長進的下賤同胞，從街頭打邊過，都有些剌目惹眼，於是乎他們也就成了一些新聞記者的經常材料，報紙上每地税增高　加租二成　經濟衰落　扣薪二成　振基</p>
<p>日都有他們的地位，好像名流行踪那麽様的，每日都有。這是不好的現象，不過當局眼中的不好，僅是「有碍觀瞻」，所以辦法也就只要「嚴加驅逐」，這麽來，事實已很鮮明，毋庸多所「推敲」了。</p>
<p>茲余尙有不能已於言者，是在有碍觀瞻的「觀瞻」二字。留心世事的人，若大若小，都隨處可以發現這二字的使用，上自國法重典，下逮小巷中的啓事警告，都有着牠的「排塲」。</p>
<p>習常以爲「觀瞻」二字，若以通俗口吻出之，就是「看望」，其精義則爲「塲面」在來頭上，使用上，却有正副兩種的說法，也就是積極與消極的並存，互用。比方說，在某種「已足」的設備外，若還感到「有未盡善處」，實際上並不是本質的考究，於是就要加配一種東西，「以莊觀瞻」，簡言之，是「壯觀」，是謂景象壯麗，事端奇偉，有可觀者，這是純粹從外觀從具體上而言，行文所及，就成了精神使用法，其意義也就漸次玄妙起來了，這是積極的正面說法。其副面呢，原不過把上冠的字面略略一改，以壯」調成「有碍」，好比嚴令取締乞丐一様，因亦於「觀瞻」有關，不過這是從消極的損减方面入手，事實上也就是「以壯觀瞻」、因爲减損一些不相配稱的牽搭，就無形爲原有事物而增光生色，只是區指詞上的差别，實質是兩位一體，「以壯」也罷，「有碍」也罷，爲的都不過是「觀瞻」，爲「觀瞻」而排塲。</p>
<p>這些實在的比方來說吧：外國的王公貴人來華覲謁總理陵墓，當局爲「觀瞻」起見，就必要預先準備好些時，把各處刷洗一過，若還不足，更加以燈彩之裝紥，以求適合「以壯觀瞻」。同時不免有些地方，遊人稀少，以致蔓草没脛，察看之下，實實「有碍觀瞻」，就必要星夜鳩工刈割，結歸也就歸到「以壯觀瞻」上去了，不過略微消極點罷了。又如集陣觀兵，個個要整容，或者新配幾種武器，是「以壯觀瞻」，如有惡習之徒，歪帽拖鞋，是「有碍觀瞻」，就要在事前五分鐘，嚴加檢舉，或申斥立改，或根本把他淘汰開去，不准上陣，也是一椿實情。餘如學校的名額要做得精緻，以及巷尾街頭多滑稽啓事，以及商肆招牌等等，通通帶住不表了。</p>
<p>因爲「觀瞻」的精義是「塲面」，所以也只要力求外觀以了事，本質的缺陷與否，那是枝節，可不必遠謀深究，中國的一切事，都可作如是觀。</p>

<p>答應了幾個熱烘烘的朋友的約會，破題兒第一遭的走上××大飯店去，在閃耀的霓紅電光下，我被那巨大的建築呑進去了，踏上電梯，默念着「六○八」，「六○八」號是幾樓？「六樓」！鐵靑面孔的司機硬綳綳這麽回答了兩個字，我也就一瞬眼的到達了第六樓。衝進門，呵，烟霧繚繞的窒息中，除了嬉笑聲外，就只見炒燥荳似的麻將聲的繁響，白板，發財，三翻，滿貫，說句不近「振拔」的話，我眞是個傻瓜，漂泊在外地，昇沉於大都會中，已近十年了，對於麻將一類的人生大事，却還是十足道地的門外漢，而且一見别人玩得那麽起勁，我就感到頭痛，甚至惱怒他們。</p>
<p>「阿木林來了」！C君首先抬起頭瞥見了我說：</p>
<p>「原來你們就是這麽一套！約會什麽？」雖然自己有些傻氣，却不慣别人隨口嬉笑，我滿不高興的煞住他們。</p>
<p>「就是在等你來，你不早些來，我們不是先玩玩！人生何苦那麽正經！」這麽說來，他們倒是偶然的「逢塲作戲」了，而且爲的是等候我。</p>
<p>餐後，回到房裏，酒醉的睡倒了，飯飽的放鬆褲帶，擺開兩腿，坐上沙發，像一座鼓腹的塑相，大家沉默着，面面相覷。許有半小時久以後，大家才開放話匣：有報告現生活情形的，有叙述世事感想的，也有漫談女人瑣事的，獨是新從故鄕來的W君報告農村崩潰的實情，最堪傾聽：他說年成是豐收，榖子僅一元三角一擔，可是却苦了一般佃農自耕農，生活簡直熬煎不過，要鹽吃，從外面輸入，經過重重的卡税，販到鄕間要一千五百文一斤，農民辛辛苦苦種出一擔稻，換不了幾斤鹽，只好淡食。原前田賦捐，每兩餉，不過還納三元，現在因附加什麽保安隊費，義勇隊費，救國捐附加攤派，已驟增到二十多元一兩，老百姓納不出，就只有跟隨官兵去嘗鐵窗風味，或者出重利五分延借一二個月補納。</p>
<p>談着談着，很快就是深夜了，大家都疲乏了，沉默的空氣，又籠上了各個的身心。</p>
<p>「大家没話說了，我提議再來四圈」！是最愛這一套的D君深恐沉默的延續，伸着懶腰這麽說，我們四個不會玩的便一齊反對，終算暫時拆散了他們一隻脚。但是我們一睡覺來又只聽房裏的麻將聲響。</p>

<p>— 沙基</p>
<p>（二）「自由之花「導演鄭正秋（下）</p>
<p>以上可以說是他對於中國電影導演之感想。其後關於他自己的作品，我是這様的徴求他的意見：</p>
<p>「鄭先生對於近作「春水情波」有什麽意見」？</p>
<p>「關於「春水情波」嗎？」他笑笑的說：重重的吸着他的絞盤牌。「因爲當時生病，有時在工作中發起毛病來的時候，便想很快的結束。同時因爲拍到後來片子超出了應有的長度，所以也就臨時省掉了幾個塲面。以致有幾個人物出來，觀衆覺得突如其來。……」</p>
<p>「關於到西北去這一口號的提出」，我問：「先生是否認爲它有必要？在這中國經濟全操縱在世界列强手中的時候。」</p>
<p>「這是有相當的事實根據的。在「九一八」之前，確有張天疇其人的到綏遠開墾，成績還好。可是「九一八」以後，也就不行了。</p>
<p>「世界上自然有不少偶然的事實。不過在目前東北完全斷送便提出到西北去的口號，到底是藝術家走頭無路的一種怯懦的希望。而且列强在華之勢力，不能根本剷除，根本就没有實現這希望的可能。所以目前反帝運動，對於電影作是最大的任務。與其提出空洞的口號，不如澈底的反帝：特别是當這第二次世界大戰馬上便要爆發，中國將成爲屠塲而被瓜分的時候。」</p>
<p>這一次我們談話很多，不能一一盡記。在他過去的作品中，他說以「自由之花一最爲滿意，因爲那是反帝的作品。現已開拍「貴人與犯人」，是由他早年之新劇（他說：現在都稱之爲文明劇）。脚本改編的。他相信這一作品不致失敗。這是很有情感的倫理片，胡蝶在舞臺上就演得很好。不過他也担心着演員的生活不夠豐富，要缺乏鄕村生活的演員去飾農村中人，恐怕不能逼眞。在這裏他提出了演員訓練的問題，他希望由各公司合辦一演員訓練學校。不過我個人以爲演員的技術不是在課堂中而是在實際生活中去體念，這一點他也同意，可以由俄國演員技藝上得着證明。同時他要求本刊能多介紹關於演員之技術的理論。這類的敎材，在中國雖然也有一二人著書立說，可是將那種東西實際的運用起來，那就醜得不成話了。最主要的是他反對二重檢查，他担心中國電影在不久將受着政治惡化的控制，到那時那恐怕不能說自己所要說的話了。</p>
<p>最後他談及他的履歷：民國初年，有自日本歸國者多人，首倡新劇，是時他主筆中華日報，常爲文評劇。自後有西人興辦亞細亞電影公司，欲請此輩新劇中人拍攝影片，然因條件不合未妥，於是由張石川之介紹而由他招集多人，親手編劇導演，開拍第一部影片「難夫難妻」。不幸民二年二次革命發生，上海爆發戰事，西人驚歸。無已，將諸演員改業新劇。有「不情人」「苦乳媽」等劇問世。繼續十餘年之久。旋上海「信交」風潮盛行，組織大同交易所。失敗，乃以餘股開辦明星公司，當時資額不及二萬元。同事者有鄭鷓鴣，任矜蘋等。此爲十餘年前之事。（（二）完）</p>
<p>刊誤　本月二十六日此處刊載「演員的技巧和導演編劇……」一文中，第二段中“ut”字下落去文字一節。該叚應爲「……傳來一聲“ut”，那結果一定是非常之糟。相反，當著一個演員對於一種表情再也不能繼續下去的時候，適可而止地來一個“ut”，當然結果必定是出乎演員意料之外的圓滿。」特此更正</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c245">評「迷途」 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>中國電影，自一九二九年下期開始走上了新的道路以後，事實上整個影壇藝術家，都受着强烈的剌戟而跟着在這路上前進。自然這是頂好的現象。可是如將這個陣容加以嚴格的檢討，那末不僅是步伐不整齊而已，而是有許多藝人好像是逼於没有辦法而不得已的跟着轉變。同時，更有些藝人是以「大衆化」做幌子，企圖成功他們自己的說敎。</p>
<p>關於這一點，我們可在「迷途」中得着證明。</p>
<p>「迷途」中告訴我們一些什麽呢？工人因參加「一二八」追悼會被開除，一家老小没有飯吃，做賊，坐牢，老婆給小老闆買去。這在裏我們不能否認作者對於勞苦的同情。可是作者是怎様的來解釋這一問題的呢？在最後尊崇法律的莊嚴，固然敎我們知道作者對現社會没有深切的認識，可是作者硬生生的要一個工人的孩子把娘的賣身錢，捐給航空救國，這不僅是離開現實十萬八千里，並且是牽强而不通的。</p>
<p>至於故事上的小錯誤，也是屢見不鮮的。譬如廠主明知道那個工人是來借錢，而居然敎他走進内室，但又不肯借錢給他，他爲什麽要這様麻煩，乾脆的敎他滾蛋不是簡捷了當嗎？而且一個工人能夠走進廠主家中的内室，甚至於請假一次也要和廠主當面交涉，也不合於實際。</p>
<p>導演的手法，却還可以，但嫌没有充分的在Montage方面做工夫。有些不當用Disolve的而用Dislove，同時在Lempo方面也不平均。</p>
<p>最主要的是作者對於問題的處理，非常觀念的，譬如以荒淫的跳舞和喝酒來表現資產者的頽廢等等。我覺得如將某一問題抓住了中心，决不　公式化的來空虚的誇張。這一方面表現作者生活的空虚，在没有實際生活經騐的情形之下，來處理連自己也不懂得的問題，到底是這於大膽的事。反之，若是作者僅是爲了時髦來製作這種大衆化影片的時候，那末當然是不堪設想了。然而我們對於作者張天北仍懷着大的希望。</p>

<p>— 何連</p>
<p>這個片子不過是把現代資本主義社會中的無出路的享樂的一羣的生活和社會的不景氣現象的一角加以巧構而形成的一個有情人都成佳偶的叚故事。以那個沉淪在賭塲中的靑年湯茂和那游戲塲中的少女瑪麗的結合作骨幹，再加上賭塲主韓斯爭奪遺產的穿揷，以那種歐美一般影片所難以避免的「無巧不成戲」的老套來表現出城市生活頽廢的一面。其表現的立塲，無疑地是像許多歐美影片一様，是站在麻醉，享樂，聊以自解上的。因此那城市生活之貧苦黑暗的一面，是不便表現的，所以一開塲很潦草地攝了一點窮人的景况，同時作者還企圖使觀衆在以後那些享樂，巧合的塲面中會忘懷去。其實這様一種表現的企圖，實在大可不必，有這些等於畫蛇添足－就本片原來的表現立塲上看起來。</p>
<p>本片在取材上、結構上及表現的立場上旣是這様，舊套所以在導演，表演，及其他的技術上都没有什麽可取的。眞是，就是有好導演和好演員，在這様的影片中是難有優美的新的表現的。當然在上海這様個繁華的城市中開映，必定還有不少人很覺合味。因爲他們對於這様的故事，這様的結構，這様的表現方法，是會感到相當興趣的。</p>
<h3 id="c247">評「寳石失縱記」 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 白</p>
<p>“After　Dark”</p>
<p>－－卡爾登映－－</p>
<p>首先，我得說明的，「寳石失蹝記」這個戲是卡爾登影戲院在開演「半夜歌舞」以外所加演的。</p>
<p>事實確是最雄辯了，時代到了這年頭兒，憑你有三頭六臂或者九牛二虎之力，也不得不屈服在這種社會不景氣的經濟條件之下。最近，上海各大戲院的競以歌舞來號召。無疑的，它就是一個有力的明證。－－即是說，電影商人爲維護他們的營業計，不得不在這種危機中，拿女人的大腿來吸引觀衆，以企圖興旺他們的營業。</p>
<p>現在讓我們來談論這影片。</p>
<p>這個戲，可以說是把「知人知面不知心的」這類的話爲原則，而加以暴露現社會的罪惡的故事。它裏面是描寫一個由南菲歸來的旅客，因携帶寳石遭人覬覦，乃至被竊。從大體上講，自然它</p>
<p>的形成，是比較有現實性的。但是，由於編劇者和導演者的故意賣弄滑稽，却反把這個戲弄的不倫不類，這，實在是怪可惜的。姑就下面幾點而論，那已經夠使我們感到不通了。</p>
<p>（一）享利和哈威把毛頓擊倒以後，旣不把他處死，又不設法移去，却把他放在沙發上，隔了許多時間等待爱爾佛來解圍。顯然，這是和事實隔離的太遠了</p>
<p>（二）哈威在老者的家中，遇到享利，那時鑽石的下落，還没知道，而就貿然行兇，也是很勉强的。</p>
<p>（三）愛爾佛在窗中窺見，　哈威擊倒亨利，就走進老者的家去是該的。但一度警慌後，就安然的走出。事實上怕不會如此吧？</p>
<p>（四）老者處於這種嚴重局面之下，而仍是好像安然無事，和後來電燈恢復了光明，珠寳還没有拿到手，毛頓和愛爾佛就面帶笑容地互想接吻，都是好像爲了要使發笑而產生這様動作的。</p>
<p>所以這個戲，我不是說句過分的話，它所以弄到這麽畸形的，完全由于導演者和編劇者自己的理解不清所致。演員的表演，雖是還忠實，但在這種劇情支配之下，是决不會給觀衆滿意的。</p>
<p>不過，話又得說回來啦！這個戲，原來就是副戲--說赤裸些，這就是所謂添頭戲。反正，女人的歌舞，也許可以償還觀衆們的代價了吧！</p>

<p>— 波倫</p>
<p>時代變遷得如此之快，現在的紐約已經不是當年的紐約了。那時候：暖和的飯店滿處皆是，酒館戲院林立。出去的時候，身上着了皮大衣，領子高高的，一些也不覺得寒風的料峭。進了戲院，買了前四排的座位。從戲院裏出來，或是呌了汽車，在車廂裏龍那德將你抱得緊緊的，連他心房的跳　都可以聽得見的；或者你們可以步行回家，一路看看各大商店的櫉窗，裏面陳列着紅的寳石，綠的翡翠，袒背的晚禮服，黑絲絨的睡衣，看得眼光繚亂，脚亦不覺得累。但是現在已經不同了。離地下電車站一箭之遠的路，酸痛的脚都走怕了。滿城的飯店都不見了，祇見放賑所，飢餓的男子站成一條線，一個一個挨上去領一塊麵包。在第五街僱傭介紹所的門前，那裏亦站潢了人。京許你亦在裡面站着，站了好幾個鐘頭，可是一無結果。有的時候你看見一家飯店或商店門口，掛着招請女招待，招請女售品員的紙牌，但是你瞞不了店裏的老板。没有煎過牛肉餅的，决不會煎牛肉餅；没有賣過襪子的，你亦不懂怎様賣法。</p>
<p>伊麗莎白還算有運氣，她遇到了一位格蘭茜。由格蘭茜的籌劃，伊麗莎白居然能夠冒充了一個有經騐的女工，在一爿製鞋廠裏找到了工作。頭一天上工的時候，工頭目不轉瞬地看着她。她從工頭的餓虎似的目光中，領會到他是在看他，從脚起，經過大腿，到腰往上，她靑春肉體的曲線，已經被他透視得一覽無遺。她立時臉上起了兩朶紅雲，羞涩得無地自容：但是想到禮拜五發薪水，就可以買麵包牛肉餧養林柏加的全家，她終於安心做事了。况且還有龍那德的前程，怎能不加以考慮呢？</p>
<p>不久島格拉斯在戲院裏找着了一件小事。他的職務祇要說Yes一個字。他就一天到晚，練習Yes各種各様的說法。不相信或看不起人，亦照様的說yes，可是另有一種表演的神情。小兄弟藹弟亦找着一件事，在小兒運動塲作一個助理員。他一天到晚忙着，工錢是做一天，一塊錢。島格拉斯好不了多少，他的工錢是十二塊錢一個禮拜。</p>
<p>這時　林柏加的客堂已經不是人家聚集的地方了。最舒適的一張大沙發，留聲機器，大穿衣鏡，伊麗莎白最喜歡的綠地　，都已變賣了。祖母的大自鳴鐘已經歸了派克街富室作擺飾了。可喜的是他們已經可以不愁飢餓。每禮拜二吃牛肉餅，禮拜三吃煎柴魚，禮拜四吃紅燒牛肉。但是想到牛扒，伊麗莎白就上牛肉莊的門外望着。她寛慰着她自己牛扒没有絕跡，將來還有吃到的一天。但是他們的命運，是否是一天好似一天，還是個問題；就是伊麗莎白在鞋廠裏的工作，亦不是什麽長久的局面，她還得時時提防着那工頭不斷的輕薄和誘惑。（未完）</p>

<p>Quickly Repelled After Brief Encounter</p>
<p>Korean Battalion Completely Recaptured</p>
<p>Fang Leads Remnants to Retreat Towards Chahar Border</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Bomb Tangshan Streets</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 3:00 AM this morning, Jiyun's forces, consisting of 500 cavalry and over 200 infantry, attacked Xiaotangshan. They were repelled by the Gu Company of the 682nd Regiment of the 130th Division of the National Army. At dawn, Fang's sentries attacked the Nan Zhongying post of Xiaodongzhuang, located four or five li from Tangshan, but were driven back by machine gun fire from the Second Company of the National Army. After these failures, Fang Jiyun's troops did not attack again this afternoon.</p>
<p>After their unsuccessful attack on Xiaotangshan this morning, Fang and Jiyun's forces retreated towards Nanzhuang, located fifty li north of Xiaotangshan, and hid in the deep mountains to avoid Japanese bombing. The morale of Fang's troops is now low. There are two types of trenches in Fang's positions: the first facing north, against the Japanese; the second facing south, against the National Army. It is rumored that most of them are preparing to flee north. There are no traces of Fang's troops in the Korean Battalion area, which has been completely recaptured by the National Army. Part of Fang's forces retreated towards Jiudahe Nanzhuang in Changping. Shops in the Korean Battalion are operating as usual, and the local area is peaceful. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang and Jiyun's troops plan to harass Nankou via Jiudaokou and to return to Pingyifen Garrison in two routes, infiltrating towards Changping to cut off the PingSui Railway. The authorities have dispatched troops to Nankou and the vicinity of Changping to block them. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 9:00 AM this morning, two Japanese planes dropped four bombs near Xiaotangshan: one landed on the road of Datangshan, one in the Tangshan Garden, one on Nanshan, and one within a National Army sentry post. All landed in open areas, causing no casualties, only damaging buildings and trees. Fang and Jiyun are currently deploying defenses in Mayu Village, Xingshou Village, Qin'cheng Nanzhuang, and Nanzhuangying, five locations north of Xiaotangshan. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Four Japanese planes suddenly flew over the north and south streets of Tangshan City at 8:00 AM this morning, dropping two bombs, and then dropped more than ten bombs outside the city. The extent of the damage is unknown. They then flew northeast. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong stated that Fang Jiyun's bandit troops' southern invasion failed and they have retreated into the northwestern mountains. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) This afternoon, Military Attache Shibayama visited He Yingqin, stating that according to reports obtained by the National side, Fang and Jiyun's troops, due to the failed attack on the Korean Battalion and Tangshan, are retreating in different directions into the mountains of Pingyifen, a dozen or so li southwest of Huairou. The Japanese troops blocking at Niulanshan have withdrawn to Miyun. The majority of Fang and Jiyun's troops have retreated; scattered remnants have not been cleared immediately. Shibayama stated that the Japanese troops would return to their original defenses as soon as Fang and Jiyun's remnants completely withdraw from the war zone. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Fang and Jiyun's troops are retreating in three directions: (1) gathering at Xiangtang Village, Niutouling, and Mayu; (2) exiting Guilin Kou and heading north via different routes towards Erdaoguan; (3) Jiyun's forces, being on the right flank, are going directly to Yanqing via Qincheng and Longhuzhuang.

<p>(Beiping) According to a source, Fang's troops attacked the Korean Battalion yesterday and were repelled by the National Army. A large part of Fang's army on the Banqiao side was bombed by Japanese planes. Seeing that their plan was unlikely to succeed, they fled towards the Taolinyukou pass. Fang himself has led his troops to Chahar territory, intending to join forces with Tang's troops. According to Fang's captured soldiers, the unit that fled south from Dushikou into Hebei consisted of approximately 3,000 to 4,000 men, but with only over 1,000 rifles, their strength is weak. Many of the soldiers were coerced and did not come willingly. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">No More Scattered Soldiers Within Shunyi Territory <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Military source: A telegram from Baxianzhuang reports that Fang's bandit troops' intrusion into the Korean Battalion has been repelled by the garrisoned troops. In the Erdaoguan area, they were bombed by Japanese planes with seven bombs, resulting in many casualties. They then fled into the deep mountains north of the Korean Battalion, about twenty li away. There are no traces of bandit troops within Shunyi territory. Their trend seems to be to flee west through the area north of Changping. According to captured officers and soldiers of Fang's troops, Fang and Jiyun gathered their subordinates before departure, claiming to have considerable connections with the military police and the Japanese in the vicinity of Beiping and Tianjin. This time, their departure would surely allow them to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival in Peiping. However, their southward invasion was blocked by the Central Army in the area north and south of the Korean Battalion and Tangshan, and they were also bombed by Japanese planes. The troops then realized that they had been deceived by Fang's words, resulting in extremely low morale. Besides those killed or scattered, their remaining forces are limited, hiding in the deep mountains around Jiuduhe, about forty li northwest of the Korean Battalion. It is speculated that they intend to scatter through the mountainous area south of Zhangjiakou via the area north of Changping. The local authorities have issued orders to all troops on the PingSui Line to strictly prevent and block them. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Gu Dequan, Company Commander of the 130th Division of the National Army, captured two spies from Fang's forces this morning. They confessed that they were previously officers of Fang's forces because Fang wanted to resist Japan, so they joined the army. Now knowing that Fang has other intentions, they plan to escape. Fang's military plans have now changed, deciding not to attack Beiping. They now have two options: (1) flee into the high mountains to avoid Japanese planes and National Army suppression, and preserve their strength; (2) flee towards Yanqing and join forces with Tang's troops. It is heard that Tang has moved from Yanqing towards the Sihai area. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) After the Huairou County Magistrate Xu Wenquan and Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Yunkui were replaced by Fang with Liu and Li, eight hundred troops arrived in Huairou on the 26th and placed the new County Magistrate Liu under custody. Public Security Bureau Chief Li Zhi has already fled. With both the positions of County Magistrate and Public Security Bureau Chief vacant, the Japanese army appointed two others to take office. What will happen in the future is a concern. Order in Huairou has gradually been restored. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) In order to drive out Fang and Jiyun's troops from the war zone, the Japanese army dispatched the main force of the 8th Division's infantry, cavalry, and artillery to Miyun on the 25th. On the morning of the 26th, 800 men were dispatched to Huairou and 200 to Niulanshan. Therefore, Fang's troops began to withdraw west from Niulanshan on the 27th. A portion of the Japanese army has now reached the Sishang Village and Liangshanzhuang area. Traffic between Ping and Mi will be restored in one or two days. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army received information that Fang and Jiyun's subordinates have withdrawn from the demilitarized zone of North China, so the area has now returned to peace. From the beginning, the Kwantung Army announced that if rebel troops or Chinese government forces invaded the demilitarized zone stipulated in the Sino-Japanese Agreement, it would take strict measures. Since the Japanese side held this attitude, and the Chinese government forces were also on high alert, the rebel army saw the situation was unfavorable. Most of them retreated west to Chahar, and some surrendered to the government forces. (28th Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e21">Controlled Economy and Rural Revitalization <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The theory of a controlled economy is spreading widely. The discussion of rural revitalization is also quite noisy. This is mainly because of the influence of the American Industrial Recovery Act, and secondly because of the stimulation of domestic agricultural and industrial decline. Without fundamentally eliminating the past state of unlimited production and establishing a planned economic organization for the present, it is impossible to reverse the decline. This is why everyone is flocking to this path. However, the decline of China's industrial sector today is similar to that of other countries, but the actual situation is very different. Taking the silk and tea industries as examples, in the silk factories of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, less than one-third of the original equipment is continuing to manufacture this year. Some of the cotton mills that stopped work have not yet returned to their original state. The tea industry is also very depressed. The reason is not due to overproduction. China has not yet developed various other heavy industries. For example, the Hanyeping Factory has been out of operation for several years and remains stagnant. There is no news of preparations for restarting. The mining industry in various places, except for the Kailuan and other mines operated by foreign capital which still have some surplus, is operated by domestic companies. Regardless of whether it is a government-run, private-run, or joint government-private enterprise, all are suffering from losses. In addition, transportation industries, such as the state-owned railways and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which is related to water transportation, cannot meet their expenses and cannot develop upward. Coupled with the threat of dumping policies in capitalist countries, especially Japan, the future of the country's nascent industry is becoming increasingly bleak. As a result, factories are finding it more difficult to maintain operations. The number of unemployed people is gradually increasing, and society is becoming unstable. This is the current situation of China's industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Although China's economic structure has changed due to the decline of industry and commerce, its foundation is still in agriculture. If agriculture can flourish or even maintain the status quo, the industrial economy can still be adjusted to some extent, even if it suffers from panic. However, looking back at China's agricultural production, in the provinces and regions of the Yellow River basin with loess soil, on the one hand, it is restricted by special climates. After thousands of years of cultivation, the natural fertility has been almost exhausted. There is neither artificial fertilizer nor irrigation. Agricultural development is very difficult. Although areas south of the Yangtze River are not as dry as the north, they have suffered repeated floods in recent years, and their vitality has also been severely damaged. Moreover, in various parts of China, the distribution of rural land is mostly based on an overly small-farm system, which makes improvement very difficult. Rural economies are becoming increasingly bankrupt. In famine years, ordinary farmers cannot support themselves. Urban factories cannot fully absorb a large number of industrial reserve teams. In bumper years, the rice-producing areas suffer disasters due to low grain prices. Therefore, ordinary farmers have no way out except to leave the village to become soldiers or bandits.</p>
<p>Now, if we want to reverse the poverty of the national economy and overcome the agricultural panic, we must gather all our strength to establish a suitable method of control. Moreover, this method of controlled economy is now prevalent. The planned economy of the Soviet Union is essentially a controlled economy, and it has been effective. It has only been in place for five years, and it has jumped from an economically backward country to a position surpassing the United States of America. Since the wave of panic swept over the United States, it was almost fundamentally shaken. Recently, it has also changed direction and is working hard on a controlled economy. Although it is not truly planned production and consumption, it is definitely a facility for an extraordinary time. As for Japan's so-called controlled economy, although the purpose is to concentrate energy for the preparation of the great war, the reason why it has been able to maintain its production record since 1930 without decline is also due to this method.</p>
<p>If China wants to implement a controlled economy, the conditions for an extraordinary period are already fully met. However, most people are accustomed to being disorganized. The reason why important industries such as railways and ships have not been able to exert their effectiveness is not only due to the poor management system, but also due to too much selfishness. Therefore, if we want to improve the economic organization today, we must first clear the accumulated malpractices, and then we can establish a new foundation for a controlled economy. The need for rural economic regeneration is even more urgent than that of cities. Controlling the grain market, adjusting grain prices, and rotating rural finance are the preliminary tasks for revitalizing the countryside. Then, we need to solve the land problem and cultivate the productivity of the general society, so that all people can give full play to their strengths. Then this action in extraordinary times can surely achieve practical results.</p>

The bandit masses are using the name of the Funing County Government to collect money from the countryside, ranging from one or two thousand to one or two ten thousand, setting a deadline for submission, otherwise they will loot the villages. Therefore, the people in the villages are extremely panicked. At this moment, the closest bandits are only thirteen li away from Changli. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Jiangxi Education Department Proposes Two Goals</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Chiang ordered Xiong Shihui, Chairman of Jiangxi Province, to establish rural education in the recovered bandit areas, promote literacy, and impart necessary common sense. The Jiangxi Education Department, following the order of the provincial government, followed the points indicated in Chiang's telegram and drafted a plan for the implementation of education in the recovered bandit areas of Jiangxi Province, and submitted it to the provincial government for approval and implementation. It is heard that there are two goals for this plan: (1) to train the general public and children to thoroughly understand the crimes of the Red Bandits and the fallacies of their arguments, so as to firmly believe in the Three Principles of the People and love the country; (2) to train the general public and children to have the cultivation of citizens, the power of self-defense, and the skills of production, so as to achieve social stability and people's happiness. In all recovered counties, at least twelve public schools will be established, divided into children's and adult classes. At the same time, training institutes for teachers of public schools will be established, and reading materials and teaching materials for the public will be compiled and printed. The required funds for all counties recovered in the bandit areas will be subsidized from public funds. For counties that are partially recovered, half will be allocated by the local government and half will be subsidized by public funds. Wherever the bandit suppression troops have arrived, schools will be established accordingly, without adhering to the set rules. The goal is that all children have access to education and that all adult men have the opportunity to receive remedial education. Qian Changzhao has also consulted with Xiong in great detail on the implementation plan for this education. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

The Ministry of Interior believes that the provincial governor system should have been implemented long ago to realize the separation of military and civilian affairs. They have drafted the following points to note when changing to a provincial governor system: (1) Establishing something similar to the previous provincial assemblies, or calling them provincial political councils; (2) The various departments are concentrated and the governor is busy with affairs, so he cannot take care of everything. A Department of Political Affairs (or other) should be established to assist in handling provincial affairs, etc., to improve the organization in order to achieve perfection and avoid malpractices. This will be reported to the Executive Yuan, requesting that it be implemented immediately. (28th Dispatch)</p>

After Chiang arrived here, the soldiers and officers of the various armies were greatly encouraged and worked hard. Airfields have been built along the Yushan Railway. The large airfield in Nanchang has 30,000 workers working day and night to repair it.

Simon suggested that the existing draft disarmament treaty be slightly revised, which would facilitate the formulation of a gradual disarmament plan. Simon continued, saying that the League of Nations has a special responsibility under the treaties protecting minorities, and must guarantee fair treatment for minorities who differ in religion, race, and language from the majority rulers. When Simon made this statement, he looked at German delegate Dr. Goebbels. Whether Simon did this intentionally or unintentionally, the audience spoke highly of it. When Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss rose to speak, the entire audience applauded, except for the German delegation. This kind of expression is rare. The Austrian Chancellor spoke cautiously and self-restrainedly, only speaking about the difficult economic situation in Austria. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Simon Describes Disarmament Steps <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly's open debate began this afternoon. British representative Simon spoke first. Simon first said that the League of Nations' work has been of great value with the cooperation of the United States. He asserted that economic recovery has begun to show signs in recent months, but it can only be hoped to be completed quickly after the disarmament issue is resolved. Simon later said that recently, major powers have been blamed, saying that disarmament is not only a matter between a few major powers, but that all member states of the League of Nations are actually concerned about this matter. However, it must be known that major powers not only have a very great responsibility, but also bear the greatest burden. Therefore, a preliminary understanding must be established between the major powers. The purpose of the major powers gathering again for consultations is that although the British disarmament plan has been accepted by all countries as the basis for discussion, there are still other obstacles ahead, and now we have to find ways to eliminate them. Moreover, the countries now deeply feel the difficulty of the road ahead. No matter how important, the first goal of the Disarmament Conference, that is, the most important goal, should at least be to establish an arms treaty. In this way, the coordination of the first step in disarmament can be established, and the subsequent paragraphs will be easier to achieve. Simon did not say that the security issue is too complicated, and he cannot discuss it now, but if countries can strive for self-improvement in the spirit of good neighborliness, then general trust will be greatly consolidated.</p>

<p>(Geneva) Simon's speech continued to address the issue of minorities, saying that this is one of the most important tasks of the League of Nations Council, and the majority ruling nation should give fair treatment to minorities of different races, languages, and religions. Simon dispelled the doubts held outside on the disarmament issue, saying that anyone who criticizes the slow progress of the Disarmament Conference disregards the various difficulties encountered by the conference. It should be known that this cannot be blamed on one country. Now that the technical issues have been thoroughly discussed, it is urgent to quickly sign an arms convention so that clear results can be obtained.</p>

<p>After Simon's speech, everyone applauded in approval. Then Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss took the stage to speak, and was also welcomed by the audience. Dollfuss said that now is not the time for countries to protect themselves, but also to consider that outside the borders, there are still living beings who are also flesh and blood. Austria is now preparing to adopt a new constitution based on the principles announced by the Pope. Recently, at the Catholic Congress held in Vienna, the Austrian people expressed their devout belief in Catholicism. In a firm tone, Dollfuss announced Austria's determination to maintain its independence. Then Canadian representative Mennivock passionately advocated the rationalization of the arms industry. Then Chairman Walther announced the adjournment of the meeting until Friday, apparently because only a few people had registered to speak. Now it is hoped that more representatives will register to speak so that the conference can have more vitality in the discussion. (27th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Advocating the Implementation of Sanctions</p>
<p>Capital of Romania The Little Entente countries issued a communique after holding their last meeting in Sinaia. It stated that the foreign ministers of Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia have completely consistent views on the overall political and financial situation in Europe. Although improvements have been seen in some aspects, the situation is still serious in some places. The three foreign ministers were quite satisfied with the non-aggression treaties signed between the Soviet Union and various countries, but they believed that the situation in Central Europe was quite worrying. The three foreign ministers also decided on the policy that should be adopted when discussing Central European issues internationally, that is, on the one hand, insisting that the peace treaties cannot be modified, and on the other hand, advocating economic cooperation with neighboring countries. The three foreign ministers also elaborated on the economic plan set by the Little Entente countries when they met in Prague in June of this year and adopted various decisions to make it a concrete plan and strive to realize it in the short term. The economic conference of the Little Entente countries is scheduled to be convened at the beginning of November this year. Regarding the issue of disarmament, the Little Entente countries advocated supporting all countries in their efforts to realize general peace and enabling the automatic and effective arms inspection system to be implemented uniformly in all countries. They also advocated that sanctions must be tried to prevent countries from violating the arms convention that is about to be signed. Also, the two non-aggression treaties signed by Romania and its neighboring countries and the Soviet Union one after another on July 3 and 4 of this year have been approved by King Carol and all outstanding issues between Romania and Yugoslavia have been resolved.

<p>Capital of Yugoslavia After attending the Little Entente countries meeting, King Alexander of Yugoslavia will go to the Balchik Palace on the Black Sea coast to visit the Queen Mother of Romania (i.e., Alexander's mother-in-law) and stay there for a while. Then he will go to the port of Varna in Bulgaria to discuss the issue of mutual approach between the two countries with King Boris of Bulgaria. This cause began to be discussed in the Yugoslav capital and the Romanian Sinaia Little Entente countries meeting. This trip by the Yugoslav country is just a continuation of the previous discussion. According to reliable sources, after meeting with the Bulgarian King, Alexander will officially visit Turkish President Kemal in Turkey. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Japanese Ambassador Sato, the representative to the Disarmament Conference, met with US representative Davis on the 27th. Mr. Sato said that the United States' conditional acceptance of the international management of armaments is questionable in terms of how the international management will be applied to naval armaments. Therefore, Japan opposes the implementation of such questionable international management. He also said that the fact that France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, which left the Disarmament Conference, are discussing the disarmament issue in Rome based on the Four-Power Treaty is worrying. Representative Davis seemed to say that the United States also opposes the Disarmament Conference of only four countries. (28th Dentsu Telegram)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Budget Committee met, and Secretary-General Avenol explained the financial situation. First, he reviewed the income and expenditure figures for the past years, and then discussed the budget for 1934, saying that no matter how frugal, the income will eventually be insufficient, and the scope of the League of Nations' activities will have to be reduced. He said, "We can consider next year as a year of silence, anticipation, and dormancy in some areas of activity." In reality, the serious situation may even be worse than this, and we have to completely revise what the League of Nations Assembly has decided in the past few years in order to reduce the League of Nations' theoretical activities and make them compatible with its financial capabilities. Avenol then spoke about the serious problem of some countries' arrears of dues, saying that "the League of Nations is prepared to gradually and continuously work to save expenses, but member states should also make the same efforts to pay their dues," and so on.

<p>The Internal Guard Joins the Patriotic Front</p>
<p>The Strength of the Current Government is Increasing</p>
<p>Vienna Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss's actions to disband the Internal Guard and gradually eliminate political parties have aroused strong reactions from the Socialist Party today, declaring that if Dollfuss wants to complete his plan, it will cause a general strike or even lead to internal strife. Socialists are not as easy to deal with as Germans. At the same time, the party has convened a meeting of various trade unions and party leaders to decide on the party's future actions. However, the government's communique stated that the Internal Guard was automatically disbanded by its leaders and joined the Patriotic Front organized by Prime Minister Dollfuss. The leader of the Internal Guard also stated that this new movement has made political parties no longer necessary in the future. The statements of the party leaders and government officials all indicate that the various political parties will soon be dissolved. Socialists also believe that this movement is nothing more than a sign that Dollfuss will soon publish a fascist constitution and transform government agencies, so that it will be no different from the current German government. Furthermore, it will definitely ban trade unions. Socialists have already stated that they would not be surprised if an order to dissolve the Socialist Party is issued within 24 hours.

<p>The Policy Will Be Determined After Listening to Ishii's Report</p>
<p>The US-Japan Arbitration Treaty is Considered Possible to Realize</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota will wait for the return of Plenipotentiary Ishii in October to listen to the details of the London Economic Conference. At the same time, regarding the US-Japan arbitration treaty that Plenipotentiary Ishii talked about with US President Roosevelt, he will exchange opinions frankly and without hesitation to establish future strategies and decide on policies towards the United States. Before deciding on the Empire's attitude towards the next Disarmament Conference, the new Foreign Minister will consider how to ensure the peace guarantee between Japan and the United States. He also mentioned this matter when he met with Marshals Araki and Osumi. If the current naval building competition between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan is left unchecked, the 1935 Disarmament Conference will inevitably fail. Therefore, it is necessary to have some kind of security guarantee coordination at this time. If this coordination is like the Manchurian issue and the Monroe Doctrine, with subtle issues of particularity, the US Senate may not object to the old situation before the treaty. From this point of view, the meeting between Foreign Minister Hirota and Plenipotentiary Ishii is extremely important. (28th Dentsu Telegram)</p>

<p>Lloyd George Bitterly Discusses the World Situation</p>
<p>(Paris) The "Chronicle Magazine" will publish tomorrow an article by former British Prime Minister and Liberal Party leader Lloyd George, entitled "Wounded Europe." It begins with a semi-humorous tone, describing the current difficulties of Europe, saying that the British Empire is in better shape, and our desire to sweep the snow from our own doorstep is therefore increased. He then bitterly criticized the League of Nations, saying that it has failed in all aspects, which is a painful fact. When it comes to the German military issue, he said, "Germany is painstakingly preparing for war. We have new evidence every day of the increasing militaristic thinking of German youth. It may take Germany several years to prepare for a war, but expanding armaments is tantamount to war." He then said that most of the British public's goodwill towards Germany has recently declined significantly, due to Germany's mistreatment of Jews. After recounting Germany's isolated situation, Lloyd George said that Britain is currently very concerned about overseas colonial issues, especially the Indian issue. Finally, he mentioned Japan's naval policy, saying that Japan still wants to increase its naval power, especially its naval air power, which makes other powers with important interests in the Pacific more uneasy. This is why Britain and the United States want to maintain mutual understanding. The article ends by analyzing the U.S. economic recovery plan and praising President Roosevelt's efforts.

<p>Japanese Army Ministry Denies Plans to Increase by Four Divisions</p>
<p>But Reforming Armaments for War Against Russia is True</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Reliable sources say that the concentration of Soviet Russian troops in the Far East is actually beyond expectations. It far exceeds the Second Russo-Japanese War plan attempted during the Russian imperial era. In particular, the preparation of a large number of submarines and heavy bombers that can still return after bombing the entire empire, in an attempt to disrupt the connection between the empire and the mainland, poses a major threat to Japan's national defense. Military authorities are paying close attention to the Soviet Union's active military plans. (Dentsu, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army Ministry issued an informal statement today denying the addition of four divisions to the Japanese Army, saying that this news is untrue. The statement said in part: Recently, rumors have spread in the world that the Japanese Army Ministry has decided to increase its force by four divisions. In fact, the Army does not have a plan to increase the number of divisions, but only to improve equipment. Originally, the strength of the Japanese Army shifted in accordance with the situation on the mainland and determined its strength. After the Russo-Japanese War, in order to guard against Russian revenge, the standing army was expanded to 25 divisions. Subsequently, due to the urgent need to expand the navy domestically and the financial difficulties after the Great Kanto Earthquake, the army's funding was not secured. On the foreign front, during the European War, all Russian troops stationed in the Far East were transferred back to the Eastern Front to defend against Germany. Later, Russia underwent a revolution and was unable to take care of the Far East. Given these internal and external situations, the army adopted a policy of reducing its forces and changed the standing army to 17 divisions. Recently, the situation in Russia has changed drastically, and its military has made great progress in 15 years. Its first five-year plan has also been successful, and its domestic heavy industry and military industry have also developed greatly. Recently, its army has 75 infantry divisions and 13 cavalry divisions, totaling 990,000 men. The air force has 2,200 aircraft and 1,500 tanks. There are many new types of tanks. Since the Manchurian Incident, relations between Russia and Japan have changed, and Russia's military preparations in the Far East have also been greatly strengthened. It is said that there are ten army corps, 300 tanks, and 360 aircraft in the Far East, including dozens of the latest bombers stationed in Vladivostok, which can travel between Tokyo and Vladivostok and destroy major cities in our country. Under these circumstances, the army must be fully prepared for national defense. Recently, nationalism has spread throughout the world, and the army's equipment has also been greatly strengthened, with more emphasis on air force tanks, tank trucks, and increased firepower, so great importance is attached to machine guns. Therefore, in order to maintain the security of "Manchukuo" and be responsible for jointly defending the border, the Japanese army intends to increase various armaments, seek the mechanization of the army, and prepare sufficient firepower. This plan is a fact. As for the addition of four divisions, it is definitely a rumor. The army does not have such a plan. (China United News Agency, 28th)</p>

<p>Aims to Fix the Price of Gold</p>
<p>Preventing Direct Inflation of Currency</p>
<p>(Washington) Key figures in U.S. financial circles claim that the U.S. President has actually drafted a new monetary policy. His trip to his Hyde Park private residence is only to make final adjustments so that he can announce it in detail. The purpose of this policy is to give gold a definite future and eliminate its uncertainty, while stimulating industry and commerce to have a more commercial level. As for its content, currency experts have not yet heard anything, but it is expected that it will not immediately inflate the currency. Officials in the Treasury Department are currently unwilling to comment on it, but according to one expert, he believes that the U.S. President's new policy will produce a gold-backed currency or commodity whose price will fluctuate with the commodity and whose gold and other metal components will be adjusted from time to time so that it can always purchase a certain amount of commodities and exchange a certain amount of services. The government's large-scale investigation of price indices has been underway for several weeks and is still continuing, but it is sufficiently complete to enable the government to obtain all the necessary information to serve as the basis for determining the price of gold. According to reliable sources, the government's adoption of this policy can greatly facilitate the negotiation of war debts because it can enable debtor countries to know the approximate value of gold in the long term to come. It is also heard that the U.S. government's adoption of this new policy is due to the enormous pressure from both the inflation and anti-inflation factions, seeking a way out and hoping to eliminate the inflation movement. According to White House sources, the U.S. President will stay at Hyde Park for a week, cutting off all political affairs and focusing on discussing currency and the recovery plan.

<p>(Nanjing) Wang Boqun proposed building the Chengdu-Guangzhou Railway and sent letters to officials in various provinces, planning to build a Chengdu-Guangzhou Railway connecting four provinces. The starting point is Chengdu, passing through Chongqing, Qijiang, and entering Guizhou: Zunyi, Guiyang, Dushan, and turning into Guangxi: Sien, Liuzhou, Xiangzhou, Wuzhou, and reaching Deqing, Sanshui, and Guangzhou in Guangdong. According to Wang's opinion, after the completion of this road, passenger and freight transport in the southwest and the Yangtze River can be integrated, and it will also be of great help to national defense. When the Beijing-Chengdu Railway is completed in the future, the transportation with the southeast can be completed in one go, and there is no need to rely on dangerous maritime transportation anymore.

<p>Affected by Porcelain Dumping</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to business circles, the export volume of porcelain from Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, to Siam and various islands in Southeast Asia is no less than 4 to 5 million yuan per year. Recently, due to the large-scale shipment of Japanese porcelain, the above-mentioned regions have been dumping porcelain as much as possible and making malicious propaganda attacking Chinese porcelain, resulting in a sharp decline in sales. Last year, the export of Jiangxi porcelain was only 3 to 40,000 yuan, and this year there have been no major exports. Sales have almost been completely taken over by the Japanese.

<p>Ministry of Finance Plans to Prevent It</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Inspector General of Customs reported to the Guangdong Customs that customs revenue has been declining recently. The reason is that smuggling is rampant, using the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway as a means of smuggling goods. The Guangdong Customs has no right to inspect goods transported by railway, so it knows that smuggling is happening but cannot remedy it. According to customs estimates, the annual loss of tax revenue due to this is about millions of yuan. If this continues, national tax revenue will be greatly affected. The Ministry of Finance has been asked to find a way to prevent it. It is heard that the financial authorities have consulted with the Ministry of Railways, ordering the railway to allow Guangdong Customs to send officials to cooperate with the railway bureau staff to carry out inspections to prevent smuggling and increase national tax revenue. However, the Ministry of Railways believes that the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is a joint venture between China and Britain. It is still a question whether China can unilaterally change the system. It is being carefully considered. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to customs information, there are two clear regulations regarding the handling of smuggling affairs by the branch checkpoints of each customs office in coastal areas and the authority of local military and police agencies to investigate and handle smuggled goods. (1) The customs supervisors and tax commissioners jointly issue a public announcement declaring that the handling of smuggled goods is the sole responsibility of the customs office and that local public organizations, such as anti-Japanese associations, must not interfere. (2) An order is issued by the Executive Yuan to the provincial and municipal governments with customs offices, requiring them to instruct local administrative organs to assist the customs office in cracking down on smuggling and strictly prohibiting public organizations from interfering in customs affairs. Anti-Japanese associations and other organizations must no longer forcibly take goods. The Ministry of Finance has already submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to notify the provincial governments to comply with the regulations. Yesterday, the Ministry ordered the customs supervisors to comply with the regulations in order to maintain customs administration and avoid disputes. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of autonomy in the Xikang-Qinghai-Mongolia regions, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the General Staff have been consulting for several days. The result is that after Chahar and Suiyuan are changed into provinces, the old system in the Mongol areas has not been changed at all. The government intends to support and assist the current demands of officials and civilians in the Mongol areas within the scope of possibility in order to establish a foundation for local autonomy. However, after the realization of local autonomy, all military, diplomatic, and financial issues will still be handled uniformly by the central government. The general principles for carrying out local construction under the guidance of the central government have been agreed upon. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>Transfer Gun Ownership; Implicate the Innocent</p>
<p>Raise Ferocious Dogs to Specifically Harm Chinese</p>
<p>The Righteous Army is Active, Urgently Hoping for Supplies</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: After Ma Su entered Russia, the Righteous Army in the Northeast provinces gradually disintegrated due to the exhaustion of ammunition and supplies. Recently, in order to prevent the resurgence of the Righteous Army, the Japanese conducted a household registration survey and collected firearms. Each household must have assets of more than 5,000 yuan to be allowed to keep one gun, and a specific person must be designated to use it. If it is discovered that another person is borrowing the gun, they will be sentenced to death. In a certain village in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, someone carelessly lent his family's gun to another family member. The Japanese discovered this, arrested them, and imprisoned them. The villagers, believing that they were definitely good people, jointly went to the county with more than 20 people to bail them out. The Japanese arrested all 20-plus people together, transported them in military vehicles to the village's local temple, and executed them all by shooting in public. The Japanese ruthlessly harm the Chinese in every way. Recently, at various stations along the South Manchuria Railway, they have raised many ferocious dogs. The method is to make straw figures, dress them in Chinese clothing, and hide meat in the chest and crotch areas, instructing the dogs to eat them, so that when the opportunity arises, they will specifically tear out the heart and kidneys.</p>
<p>The Japanese are invading our Northeast. In order to implement assimilation education, they have taken over school affairs in various provinces. In addition to changing textbooks to pro-Japanese teaching materials, Japanese language must be taught in all middle and higher schools. The positions of deans and instructors in all schools are filled by Japanese, whose authority is above that of the principal. The principals of various schools in Jiangyuan have mostly been replaced by pro-Japanese figures. The new principal of the Provincial First Normal School, a certain person from Jinzhou, held a large banquet for the school's colleagues upon taking office. Many Japanese were present and ordered him to hire prostitutes to accompany them. The principal said that hiring prostitutes at an educational banquet would harm his reputation and politely declined. The Japanese were furious and slapped the principal in the face. Seeing that the situation was not good, the principal pretended to agree to hire prostitutes and took the opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>In various parts of the Northeast, as the green gauze tents (tall crops that provide cover) are now rising, the Righteous Army is taking advantage of the opportunity to become active again, especially in the eastern Jilin and eastern Heilongjiang counties. However, there is a severe shortage of bullets. Recently, representatives have been sent to Guannei (within the Great Wall) to beg for assistance. The people and the Righteous Army, unable to bear the oppression and abuse of the Japanese, all hope that the national army will leave the pass as soon as possible. (Northeast News Agency)</p>

All arrangements for the reorganization and replenishment of troops, the deployment of various departments, and the post-war reconstruction of party affairs and administration have been properly made. He has decided to implement the complete suppression of the bandits and ordered Secretary-General Yang Yongtai and others to return to the province first. Chiang himself, together with his wife Soong Meiling, Chief of Guards Lou Jingyue, and two attendant physicians, left the mountain early on the morning of the 22nd and took a plane back to the province in Jiujiang. In advance, the Campaign Headquarters received a phone call from Lushan and ordered the Gendarmerie Battalion, the City Defense Headquarters, and the Water and Land Public Security Bureau to strictly guard all roads from the Zhangwai River bank and the Shunwai Airport to the Campaign Headquarters and Chiang's residence in Dewai. At 12:20, Chiang's plane arrived from the north, circled the city once, and landed in the Zhangwai River. At that time, the Water Public Security Bureau had prepared a small boat and opened it to the side of the plane. Chiang then boarded the boat with his wife and landed ashore. Those who welcomed him ashore included the directors of the various departments of the Campaign Headquarters and Xiong Shihui and others. They then took cars to Chiang's private residence in Dewai. Xiong reported to Chiang on all official matters of the Campaign Headquarters, the latest bandit situation, provincial administrative facilities, the construction of the Nanchang Airport, the expansion projects of the Ji'an, Nancheng, and Linchuan airports, and all important policies for about an hour. After a short rest, He Chengjun arrived to pay his respects, reporting on the military affairs of the bandit suppression in the three provinces and requesting instructions.

<p>Wang Yizhe, commander of the Northeast Fourth Army, and Xiong Bin, director of the Peiping Military Affairs Commission, arrived in Xun (Jiujiang) by boat on the 22nd. On the 24th, they took the early train on the Nanxun Road to the province. After entering the city, they stayed at the provincial government guesthouse behind Maiyuan. They then went to the Campaign Headquarters to pay their respects to Chiang. It was heard that Wang reported on the content of the defense funds after the operations of the various departments in the Northeast, the recent situation of salary reductions and downsizing, the future implementation of garrison training, and requested instructions on the future policies of enriching the interior and consolidating the border defenses. Chiang gave some instructions. Xiong, on behalf of He Yingqin, reported on the downsizing and inspection methods of the various departments in North China, the negotiations on the junctions of the Great Wall, and the rampant situation of the bandit army in eastern Luan. (September 24)</p>
<p>Also, Chiang set off for the front on the afternoon of the 26th of this month, braving the rain to inspect military affairs and command everything.

Chiang was wearing a blue Zhongshan suit, full of energy. At 4:20, he led his secretary Deng Wenyi, Chief of Guards Lou Jingyue, and accompanying officers and soldiers to board the car and depart. It is heard that once the official business is completed, he will return to the province to control the overall military affairs.</p>
<p>The Fuzhou Campaign Headquarters has been formally established, and Jiang Dingwen, the commander-in-chief of the Northern Route Forward, has also taken office. (September 26)</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Chiang, in view of the fact that the various armies have launched a large-scale campaign to suppress the bandits, has specially advised the virtuous gentry and people of various counties to return to their villages to save themselves and others. At the same time, he has issued an order to the various armies at the front to earnestly protect and fully cooperate with the virtuous gentry and people returning to their villages, in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Here is the text of his advice to the gentry and people of various counties: "The scourge of the Red Bandits in Jiangxi has been long-lasting, inhuman, and morally depraved. The people of Jiangxi have suffered from their devastation, and the number of those who have died wailing in agony is probably unknown in the millions. Their monstrous crimes have long been seen and known by the world. If they are not quickly wiped out, not only will the people of Jiangxi have no survivors, but the poison will inevitably lead to the destruction of the country and the nation.</p>
<p>Zhongzheng (Chiang Kai-shek referring to himself) bears the heavy responsibility of the party and the nation above, and deeply feels the suffering of the compatriots below. It is my unshirkable duty to eliminate the violence and protect the good. However, after years of deploying troops and transporting provisions, and bitter fighting, the local gentry and people have not come out to help. Society has lost its center of gravity, and the people have no leadership. The Red Bandits have taken the opportunity to seduce and coerce them. Pure and good people have followed the bandits in droves, causing the bandit flames to spread day by day, becoming a prairie fire. Thinking of this, I am deeply saddened.</p>
<p>You are the hope and the heart of the people of your villages. According to the principle that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country, how can you drift away and disregard the safety of your villages? Although it is said that the bandits hate upright people and often harm them, and that in order to protect yourselves, you have to leave your villages to avoid the danger, you should know that the Red Bandits harbor evil intentions and are by no means ordinary bandits. If you allow them to spread in the mountains and forests without eliminating them, the tragedy of destroying the countryside today will be the blueprint for trampling on the cities in the future. The only difference is the timing.</p>
<p>You are avoiding the cities because the countryside is dangerous, hoping to survive. If the cities are disturbed by bandits, where will you go? Where I can go, the bandits can also go. The disaster of the Red Bandits cannot be avoided by fleeing. Moreover, the cities depend on the countryside for all their food and clothing. If the countryside is in chaos for a long time, even if the cities are spared, they will eventually die of starvation. Without restoring order in the countryside to protect the source of food and clothing, and simply living in the cities, stealing a day's peace, like swallows in a hall, how long can it last? In short, we are in a position where we cannot coexist with the bandits. Either I kill the bandits, or the bandits kill me. If I do not kill the bandits, there is no way to escape death. If you do not have the determination to kill the bandits, but hide in the unproductive cities, it is like a bird avoiding the net and entering the cage, or a beast avoiding the hunt and entering the trap. There is no such thing as a cowardly and complacent person who can escape by breaking their own environment. If you do not want to save yourselves, then so be it. But if you do want to, there is no other way than to rise up and fight, cooperate with the army, and work together to eliminate the bandits.</p>
<p>Today, the Central Government has prepared sufficient military force and is determined to launch an attack on all fronts, with the aim of completely eliminating the bandits. This is the last day for the Red Bandits to surrender, and it is also a good opportunity for self-salvation. I hope you will not hesitate any longer, but advance with the army. Once a county is recovered, return to your villages immediately. The army will suppress them from the front, and you will clear them from the rear. You must organize the people, build blockhouses, relieve the victims, comfort the refugees, search for hidden bandits, punish the remnants, and restore the countryside. All matters relating to clearing the countryside and post-war reconstruction that the bandit suppression army cannot take care of must be carried out by you with concerted efforts. Make the people aware, so that the remnant bandits have nowhere to hide. In this way, one village will be cleared, and one county will be stabilized. We must eradicate the roots and stabilize the villages, so that there is no possibility of secret growth and we avoid repeating the mistakes of resurgence. The Red Bandits may be cunning, but they are not to be feared.</p>
<p>You save others by saving yourselves, and you save the country by saving your villages. In the future, when the bandit suppression is successful, Zhongzheng will investigate your actions, record your achievements, report them to the Central Government, and give you generous rewards. If there are those who are brave enough to go to justice, who are injured in the line of duty, or who die in the line of duty, they will be given generous compensation to show our shared hardship. I have already ordered the military and political officers at the front to treat the returning natives with love and cooperate with sincerity, in order to help and support each other. In the past, Zeng Guofan rose from the local militia and quelled the Taiping Rebellion. The reason for his success was that he relied on the voluntary assistance of the people. The lessons of the past are not far away and can be learned from. I believe that you will respect your homeland and be eager to save yourselves, so you will surely rise up and compete, and do not need Zhongzheng's earnest advice. Go forth and work hard, and may you all strive to do your best. (September 23)</p>

<p>Wu Youlan, a resident of Zhubin Hang Town, Tinglin County, is a wealthy gentleman in the town, leading him to be coveted by bandits. On the evening of the 25th, taking advantage of the rainy weather, more than a dozen bandits speaking the local dialect dug through the back wall of his house, sneaked in, removed the latch from the back door, and rushed in. They went upstairs together, tied up the victim Wu Lu and coerced him to give them money, but failed. They burned his chest. His nephew Youzhu stepped forward to intercede and was shot by the bandits. They then went into various rooms to rob more than 1,000 yuan in cash and more than 20 pieces of gold jewelry. The robbery lasted for about three hours. It was not until 1:00 AM that they left with the loot. The town's land and water police group heard the news and pursued them, but they had disappeared. The second branch of Tinglin and the security group also reported by telephone and rushed to investigate that night. Wu Lu, who is over sixty years old, was seriously injured and has been treated by himself. He has also reported to the court to request a search and arrest.</p>

Jin Gui reported to the first branch office to arrest the murderous sons for investigation. It is rumored that Jin Gui committed adultery with his daughter-in-law, and his son had harbored resentment for a long time, which led to today's incident.

<p>In the Bailonggang area of Wujiang County, a pig boat belonging to Liu Zirang was passing through the area on the afternoon of the 27th when it was suddenly encountered by a bandit boat coming from the north. It carried nine male and female bandits armed with box cannons. They rushed to the boat and arbitrarily searched for clothes and silver dollars, totaling more than 200 yuan, and left. The incident was learned by the fifteenth team of the Third District of the Water Public Security Bureau. Captain Wu led the police to pursue them, but they had already escaped.</p>

<p>The Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company has repeatedly caused major disasters since it was established. At 7:30 AM yesterday (the 28th), the company's No. 2 bus, loaded with more than 20 passengers from Cheng (Jiangyin), started to drive to Xi (Wuxi). At 8:20, when the bus was driving through Bantang Temple in the Sixth District of Xijing, the "Axle Xiaozi" (transliteration) on the wheel suddenly broke, and the bus went straight into the river on the left. The driver, Wang Leshan (28 years old, from Hangzhou), was caught off guard, causing the entire bus to fall into the river. The passengers in the bus were panic-stricken, and the sound of shouting for help and crying shook the fields. Fortunately, the driver Wang Leshan came up with a clever idea and immediately opened the glass windows on the car. He climbed ashore and saw that there were vegetable farmers on the shore. He immediately called the farmers to smash all the glass windows with carrying poles and other things. Then, the passengers in the car were pulled out one by one. However, one female passenger (about 40 years old, name unknown) was too seriously injured and died. Among the others who were seriously injured, there were ten people, including Yang Pinglv and Yu Shengrong. Nine people, including Xu Ji'an and Ren You, were slightly injured. The driver telegraphed to the Wuxi Long-Distance Bus Company, which rushed to send a small car to the scene to take the ten seriously injured to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. The nine slightly injured were taken to the Fensi Center and doctors were called to treat them. At the same time, County Magistrate Yan Shenyu also received the news and went to inspect the scene in person. The first police station of the twelfth branch of the Public Security Bureau also sent police to the scene to suppress the situation. As for the corpse, it was still placed on the bank there. At 3:00 PM, the head of the second and eighth districts, Shen Debiao, reported to the County Court, and the prosecutor led the staff to the scene to verify the injury and death. Because no family members were found, they took photos and ordered the head of the district to arrange for coffins and burial on their behalf, and wait for the family members to claim them after investigation.</p>

<p>Sun Yecheng, 32 years old, from Pukou, was formerly a policeman in the fifth and first branches of the local Public Security Bureau. Later, he was dismissed due to an incident and changed to be a messenger in the Fifth Regiment of the Garrison in Wuxi. When the Garrison was transferred to Han Gao, Sun also went west with the army. However, when he was in Wuxi, he had an affair with Wang Aimei's daughter Yuying, who sells sugar-roasted sweet potatoes in the Huangting Temple in Chong'an Temple. Yuying is now 18 years old and has a fiery relationship with Sun. After Sun went to Han, he missed her because of the separation of the two lovers. Looking back on the past, he suddenly had the idea of giving up the world. On the 13th of this month, he committed suicide by taking poison in Han. Soldiers in the same camp discovered it and reported it to their superiors. He was treated and recovered. From then on, Sun was dismissed again by his superiors. On the 18th, he came to Wuxi after traveling from Han. In the afternoon, he stayed in Room 43 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel on the Railway Station Road. That night, he secretly took one yuan of raw opium and committed suicide. Yesterday, the tea servant Shen A Da discovered it and immediately sent him to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Two letters were also found in his room, one to his lover Wang Yuying, the content was full of tender love and he couldn't bear to finish reading it, and one to the hotel manager, asking him to ask the court to waive the inspection. It is now heard that after entering the hospital, his life may be saved.</p>

<p>Last night (the 27th) around midnight, a group of twelve armed bandits broke into the home of Wang Yida, a villager in Guanyintang Village near Gangqiao in the 14th District of Wuyi, and began looting. Wang Yida and his tenant farmer, Chen Quangen, hid upstairs but were spotted by the bandits, who immediately dragged them down and demanded to know where the silver was hidden. Gunshots were heard, and both were injured and fell to the ground. The bandits searched for about an hour before fleeing with a whoop. The injured Wang Yida and Chen Quangen were transported to Wuyi Hospital for treatment today (the 28th). However, the bullets remain lodged in their bodies and require surgery. Fortunately, the injuries are not to vital organs, and their lives are not in danger.</p>

<p>In Shijiazhuang, Chema Lake District, Rugao, a man named Xue He, who makes a living by sailing, bought a large boat last year for 1,000 yuan, capable of carrying several hundred people. He recently repainted it, making it look brand new. Several days ago, he partnered with others to buy over eighty healthy pigs to sell in Jiangnan. While sailing to Fukou Port, they suddenly encountered a hurricane, with white waves surging several yards high. The boat could not anchor and was capsized into the river by a huge wave and swept away. Fortunately, Xue was rescued by a neighboring boat and survived. However, all eighty-odd healthy pigs drowned, and a boatman named Li is also missing. The losses are estimated to be over 5,000 yuan.</p>

<p>In Zhangjiagang, Gaizi South, in the western part of the county, a villager named Wang Shanjun, over thirty years old and a bricklayer by trade, was kidnapped. Because of his diligence and thrift, his family enjoyed a modest prosperity. However, his wealth attracted the attention of bandits. The other night after 9:00 PM, a dozen or so bandits suddenly rushed into his house and abducted Wang. Yesterday morning, Wang's wife found a letter in the doorway stating that 3,000 silver dollars were required for ransom. She should wait for three days and then go to Wuli Mountain outside the South Gate, using a towel hanging from a bamboo pole as a signal. Wang's wife received the letter and is extremely anxious because raising the ransom money will be difficult.</p>

<p>On September 16th, at around 4:00 PM, Lu Zhongwu and two other employees from the Yixing Stamp Tax Bureau went to Hengtaihe Shoe and Hat Store on East Main Street to promote the sale of five yuan in stamps. The shop assistant refused, saying that the owner was out and the store already had a large stock of stamps, so they could not accept them without authorization. Lu and the others then entered the accounting area and took two or three ledgers, claiming that some stamps were not affixed, and that they should be punished according to the regulations. At this point, the shop assistant shouted that they had broken into the accounting area and lost 300 silver dollars. The owner, Jiang Qianxing, rushed back upon hearing the news and argued with them. The bureau employees reported the incident to the Jiaoxiao Gang police and requested assistance from the Public Security Bureau. As a result, all the large and small shops on East Main Street considered this a disturbance to their business and declared a strike. The Public Security Bureau, upon learning of the news, feared that the situation would escalate and took Lu Zhongwu into custody to appease the public. The Chamber of Commerce chairman, Yu Xunlu, urged them to reopen the market along the way and, at around 6:00 PM that afternoon, convened an emergency meeting of representatives from various shops on East Main Street to discuss solutions.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Eurasia Aviation Corporation Manager Li Jingcong Returns from the Northwest Yesterday <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>No Need for Lanzhou-Qinghai Line Trial Flight Yet</p>
<p>Luo Wengan Already in Tacheng Meeting with Yan Envoy</p>
<p>Eurasia Through Transport Can Be Implemented Soon</p>
<p>Li Jingcong, manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after departing from Shanghai last Wednesday to inspect the company's situation along the line in the Northwest and conduct a test flight on the Qinghai line. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Li in the afternoon and discussed the following items.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Satisfied with On-Site Inspection <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Li's statement to the Xinsheng News Agency, his trip to the Northwest had three objectives: (1) to inspect the construction and operation of the company's stations along the line; (2) to thank the local authorities for their assistance; (3) to conduct a test flight on the branch line from Lanzhou to Qinghai. The situation was excellent from Shanghai to Hami. However, due to unrest in the area from Hami to Dihua and the limited time, he quickly returned and will inspect it again next time.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Suspension of Qinghai Branch Line Development <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>After arriving in Lanzhou on the return trip, he immediately conducted a test flight on the Qinghai branch line. As a result, he felt that although the distance between Qinghai and Lanzhou was 200 kilometers, transportation was very convenient. It could be reached by car in only one day, or at most one and a half days, so mail delivery would only take thirty-six hours. Also, since there were almost no passengers and airfare was too expensive, it was not very suitable for the people of that area. Therefore, there was no need to open a route for the time being. The Qinghai Provincial Government's airfield is well-equipped and can be used at any time if necessary, either once a week or once every two weeks.</p>
<p>Through Transport Awaits Gasoline. He also said that the plans for the Beiping-Suiyuan and Shanghai-Guangdong lines had been prepared long ago. However, both lines are completely related to the Eurasia through transport, so they must wait until the Eurasia through transport can be realized before they can be opened at the same time. As for the Eurasia through transport, the only problem now is gasoline. After ordering Russian oil, it has been reported that it has already begun to be transported to Tacheng. However, the company has not yet received a formal report. Once this gasoline problem is officially telegraphed as resolved and delivered, the through transport will be officially opened and implemented.</p>
<p>Luo Awaits Yan at Russian Border. Furthermore, he stated that the market in the Hami area was very depressed after the war and that the local area was currently peaceful. Chairman Ma of Qinghai recently went to Lanzhou to meet with Chairman Zhu Shaoliang of Gansu to discuss everything. It is expected that he has already returned to Qinghai within a few days. Reports that Ma Zhongying's troops attacked Xinjiang Province and intercepted the gasoline for the company's plane carrying Minister Luo to Xinjiang are not accurate. Our company is commercial in nature and has good relations with the local garrisons. The Lanzhou-Hami route is still operating as usual. Because he did not inquire about the conflict between Sheng and Ma, he did not want to talk about it further. However, he heard that Minister Luo had gone to Tacheng and transferred to Novosbirsk on the Russian border to meet with Ambassador Yan.</p>

<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's plan to establish the Shanghai-Guangdong air trunk line has been delayed to this day due to various political factors. After a successful trial flight last month, it was planned to start operations. The Guangdong side showed some dissatisfaction with the flight of this line. Recently, they established the Southwest Aviation Corporation. In order to avoid conflicts in routes and business, China National Aviation Corporation decided to suspend the Shanghai-Guangdong route. However, the Sino-American joint flight plan will continue to be implemented.</p>

The attendees yesterday included Zhu Ziqiao, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Shiying (represented by Huang), Huang Bodu, Shi Liangcai (represented by Zhao Shuyong), Wang Dankui, Zhao Jinqing, Chen Guangfu, Zheng Hongnian, Huang Hanzhi, Wang Yiting (represented by Han), Yu Qiaqing, Li Zizai, Qian Jingping, Guan Jiongzhi, Du Yuesheng, Gu Xinyi, Zhu Yinjiang, Yuan Xilian, Wen Lanting, Jin Houcheng, Bao Siren, Feng Guohua, Gu Hongru, Pan Guangxun, Yu Yingduo, Cai Xiangru, Jin Yuanzhi, Huang Xiuzhai, Zhou Zhizhen, Gu Jiacai, Wang Buyun, Shi Xixuan, Shen Yiqing, Lu Jianai, Shen Jiang, Tao Shengbai, Li Shoushan, Zhou Weishi, Xi Yunsheng, Xu Qianlin, Zheng Zhongshan, Gu Jisheng, Sun Xiangshu, Gu Nanqun, Tao Zhu, Fei Gongxia, Shao Ruxin, and others, totaling over fifty people.</p>
<p>Report on Disaster Situation. After performing the rituals, (1) Bao Tigan, the acting magistrate of Baoshan County, reported on the disaster in the five sands of Baoshan County, stating that Changxing Sand, Dongxin Sand, Ping'an Sand, Ruifeng Sand, and Shitou Sand were affected by the tidal surge, resulting in the drowning of forty-four men, women, and children, the destruction of 1,799 houses, and damage to 517 houses. Repairs to official works and embankment are estimated to require 112,000 yuan. (2) Shen Jiang, the magistrate of Chongming County, reported that the county was severely affected by a sudden hurricane, coupled with the surge of floods. All districts and Shengsi Island were severely affected, with the disaster area spanning 57 townships, covering an area of more than 700 square li. More than 203,000 mu of farmland were affected, and more than 6,380 houses were lost. The number of victims and deaths totaled more than 21,500. Grain and houses were completely swept away. Looking at the disaster area, it was a heartbreaking sight. In addition, the coastal seawall, which was more than sixty li long, was almost completely destroyed this time. The project is huge and requires more funding. (3) Fei Gongxia, the magistrate of Qidong County, reported that the disaster area accounted for about 30% of the county's total area, with the seventh and eighth districts along the coast being the most severely affected. The main crop in the county is cotton. This year, the seventh and eighth districts mostly planted improved cotton, which was expected to yield a bumper harvest. However, after two floods, the cotton harvest was hopeless, and the food harvested by the farmers was also swept away by the tide. Since the dike body was broken, the low-lying areas are still mostly submerged in water during high tide. Therefore, in addition to providing emergency relief for the food, clothing, and shelter of the victims, it is also necessary to quickly repair the collapsed dikes.</p>
<p>Resolutions. After the reports, discussions began. (1) The chairman proposed that the association be merged with the Pudong Chuannan Typhoon Relief Association and renamed the "Jiangsu Coastal Counties Flood Relief Association" in order to pool efforts and work together for mutual benefit. (Resolution) The association will appoint three representatives to contact the Pudong and Chuannan Relief Association to discuss the merger methods. (2) For emergency relief, the minimum emergency relief fund for the clothing, food, and shelter of the victims in the five counties is estimated to be 300,000 yuan, and the repair of the collapsed dikes is not included. Please decide how to resolve this. (Resolution) While proceeding with the merger, fundraising should begin immediately to provide emergency relief. In addition, three representatives will be appointed to go to the province to request the government to repair the dikes of the five counties. (3) Appointment of representatives to contact the Pudong Chuannan Relief Association and representatives to go to the province. (Resolution) It was decided to appoint Wang Dankui, representative of Chongming County, Gu Nanqun, representative of Qidong County, and Jin Houcheng, representative of Baoshan County, to be responsible for the proceedings. (4) The detailed procedures of the association will be discussed at the next joint meeting. (Resolution) Passed. The meeting adjourned after other minor matters.</p>

He did not leave until 11:30 AM. Mr. Jiang then went to the Song residence to meet with Finance Minister Song Ziwen to discuss funding for the embassy in Japan. He did not return to his residence until 10:00 AM. After visiting Mr. Huang, Mr. Jiang told reporters that Chairman Huang would soon return to Beiping to preside over government affairs, and that he would also be going east within a few days, so he came to visit to exchange views on diplomatic matters.

<p>The Municipal Authorities Are Proceeding</p>
<p>Due to the typhoon that struck the city this time, all farmers along the coast and rivers have been displaced due to the destruction of their homes and fields. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has convened a meeting with the Land and Public Works Bureaus to discuss relief measures. According to Wu Huanru, the chief of the Second Section of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the relief situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Emergency Construction of Dikes. On the dike construction front, the Eastern Dike has more damage than the Western Dike, which has no major destruction. The municipal government has allocated 50,000 yuan to the Municipal Public Works Bureau to actively repair it. The bureau has dispatched a large number of workers, supervised by Dai Erjing, the director of the Dike Construction Section, to carry out the repairs. The situation is now under control.</p>
<p>Repair of Embankments. The embankments along Huangpu River on Jungong Road have been severely damaged. There are currently more than 1,000 mu of embanked fields in that area, which are leased to farmers by the Zuohai Company, operated by Zhang Xiaoruo, Rong Zongjing, and Jin Qushan. However, the embanked fields in that area have never had a bumper year due to the rising river water. This year, they were almost completely washed away, resulting in the waste of the farmers' hard work throughout the year. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has convened the Municipal Affairs Committee member Zhu Jiajun and the Zuohai Company shareholder Zhang Xiaoruo to discuss relief measures. The company stated that the embanked fields have been losing money every year since the company started operating them, so it is impossible to allocate funds for relief. After repeated discussions, the company agreed that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Affairs Committee Office, and the company will jointly raise a considerable amount of money to hire the farmers in that area to repair the embankments, which will achieve two goals at once.</p>
<p>Relief for Villagers. The losses suffered by the farmers in Gaoqiao and other districts are relatively large. The Social Affairs Bureau and others have sent personnel to investigate and comfort the villagers, and local charitable organizations have gone to provide relief, distributing 20 cents of food per person per day, with half for children. Fortunately, the number of people is small, and there are no major difficulties in raising funds. As for the request to waive the field tax in the district, it should be given due consideration. However, there are many twists and turns in the procedures for waiving the tax, and it may be difficult to make a decision within the year. However, if the government believes that it is indeed necessary to reduce or waive the field tax, it can find a way to offset it next year.</p>
<h3 id="e130">First Batch of American Cotton to Arrive Today or Tomorrow <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Office Held Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Sales Methods</p>
<p>Hired Zhang Gongquan and Three Others as Promotion Commissioners</p>
<p>Rong Zongjing Discusses that Chinese Factories Decide to Purchase as Much as Possible</p>
<p>The first batch of American cotton purchased by China from the US loan is on the Fook Lai &amp; Co. "Essian Allen" (transliterated) and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today or tomorrow. The Ministry of Finance will hire Zhang Gongquan and others as promotion commissioners. Xi Demao, director of the US Loan Cotton and Wheat Office of the Central Bank, held a meeting with sales firms and others yesterday to discuss methods. Cotton magnate Rong Zongjing made a statement. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>First Batch of American Cotton to Arrive Today or Tomorrow. Xinsheng News Agency reported that the first batch of American cotton loaded on the Fook Lai &amp; Co. "Essian Allen" sailed to Shanghai on August 15th in America. The Shanghai Fook Lai &amp; Co. received a radio report on the itinerary the day before yesterday and is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon and will dock at the China Merchants Bureau wharf in Pudong. It will arrive no later than tomorrow morning. The manager of Fook Lai &amp; Co. has notified the head of the boat room and will send personnel to the wharf to make arrangements. The ship's manifest has arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting in Strict Secrecy. Xi Demao, director of the US Loan Cotton and Wheat Office of the Central Bank, held a meeting at the Central Bank at 3:00 PM yesterday with the Western managers of cotton firms such as Fook Lai, Anli, and Mei'an, which handle the sale of cotton, to discuss the sales of American cotton after it arrives in Shanghai. It did not end until around 4:00 PM. When reporters inquired with the director of the US Loan Cotton and Wheat Office, they all kept it strictly confidential, and Fook Lai and other firms also remained silent because they feared that the news would affect market prices.</p>
<p>Business Magnates Promote American Cotton. A Central News Agency reporter visited Rong Zongjing yesterday morning, who stated that American cotton has been shipped to China one after another from the United States. The first batch of cotton will arrive in Shanghai within a few days. The Central Bank has established an office to take charge of all matters related to American cotton after it arrives in Shanghai. As for the promotion personnel, Minister Song has hired Zhang Gongquan, General Manager of the Bank of China, Chen Guangfu, General Manager of the Shanghai Bank, Guo Shun, General Manager of the Wing On Textile Factory, and myself. Therefore, we plan to gather and discuss promotion methods within a few days. As for the sales channel of American cotton after it arrives in Shanghai, it is an important issue. In recent years, Chinese textile factories have reduced labor due to sluggish sales and overproduction. Cotton accumulation is inevitable. In addition, the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. Cash in various places is concentrated in Shanghai. Banks only accept credit and do not release loans. As a result, the financial situation in various places is far from what it used to be. The weakness of purchasing power in various ports is not only the case for American cotton. Moreover, the price of American cotton is higher than that of domestic cotton, so sales become a problem.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Stop Ordering Directly. It was previously rumored that Chinese textile factories were unwilling to buy American cotton, which is not accurate. Since Minister Song signed a US$50 million cotton and wheat loan in the United States, Chinese textile factories in this city have stopped ordering American cotton directly from the United States. Each factory knows that a whole number of American cottons have been shipped to China, so there is no need to order goods from the United States again. In the future, American textile factories will purchase American cotton from the government if they need it. The attitude of the Chinese merchants has already expressed cooperation with the government. As for Japanese merchants buying American cotton, Minister Song has also said that it is difficult for commercial organizations selling goods to distinguish which country's merchants are buying.</p>
<p>Sales of American Wheat Are Extremely Difficult. There is no exact date for American wheat to be shipped to Shanghai. At this time when rice prices are low in our country, the sales of expensive American wheat shipped to China is even more difficult. Moreover, wheat flour stocks are piling up in various ports. It is estimated that there are more than 4 million dans stored in Shanghai and Tianjin. It is estimated that such a large amount of stored wheat can be sold out in half a year, so the sales of American wheat need to be studied.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Anhui Province Sheyu Road Public Bond Held Lottery Repayment in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Six Tranche Drawn, Principal and Interest of 50,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Paid by the Agricultural and Industrial Bank at the End of This Month</p>
<p>The Anhui Province Sheyu Highway Public Bond held its first lottery repayment in Shanghai yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives. Liu Yiyan, director of the Anhui Provincial Department of Construction, Lu Wenshao, City Chamber of Commerce, Wu Bicai, Municipal Government, Ye Fuxiao, Bankers' Association, Qi Yunqing, Fund Management Committee, Cheng Zhuxin, Hangzhou China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Mao Yun, Municipal Party Department, Xu Chuanyou, Zhang Jun, Han Jun, Liu Zhongya, Li Dafu, Solicitation Officer, Cheng Kefan, Jixi Fellow Association, Cao Zhigong, Huining Fellow Association, Xu Yunsong, She County Fellow Association, Zheng Jianzhen, Wuyuan Fellow Association, and others, totaling more than thirty people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report. Chairman Cheng Zhuxin reported that Huizhou in southern Anhui is located in the midst of thousands of mountains, and transportation has always been inconvenient. Nine out of ten Huizhou people are engaged in business outside, and every time they have to travel with difficulty, they do not return for many years. The tea, Huizhou ink, compasses, sundials, bronze ware, etc. produced there are also loved at home and abroad. Export is already difficult, and the import of goods such as salt, rice, silk, cloth, groceries, etc. is even more expensive. In order to promote transportation and develop industry, the construction of highways is the most urgent task. The governments of Zhejiang and Anhui provinces have close business and travel relations and are seeking to develop transportation. Therefore, they created the Hangzhou-Huizhou Highway, including the section from She County to Yuling Pass, which is more than 70 kilometers long, with rugged mountains and difficult construction. Anhui Province has relatively difficult finances and has to raise special funds. Therefore, it issued 500,000 yuan of Sheyu Highway Public Bonds, with 98% actually received, divided into sixteen repayments over eight years, and giving 8% annual interest. Ordinary business tax revenue of 100,000 yuan per year is allocated and deposited in the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank as a repayment fund for capital and interest. The Sheyu Highway Fund Management Committee is specially established, with two people elected by the bondholders, one manager of the bank where the funds are stored, and one representative each from the Anhui Provincial Government and the two departments of finance and construction, to form a joint organization. Now it is the time for the first repayment, and it is specifically scheduled for 3:00 PM on September 28th to perform the lottery in the banking industry association in Shanghai. The Anhui Provincial Government sends a letter to various groups in Shanghai to send representatives to supervise the ceremony, and also invites the committees from Huizhou Fellow Association in Shanghai who solicited public bonds to come and visit. Then Liu Yiyan, Mao Yun, Wu Bicai, Lu Wenshao, etc. gave speeches one after another. The wording is omitted.</p>
<p>Winning Numbers. Then the supervisors Cao Shuqin and Li Dafu reviewed the lottery tickets to make sure they were correct. Then, lottery drawers Wu Zhiping and Zheng Jianyuan performed the lottery and drew six. At the end of this month, the Shanghai-Hangzhou local Agricultural and Industrial Bank and the county governments of Anhui Province will issue the numbers: "No. 08", "No. 23", "No. 39", "No. 54", "No. 76", "No. 89". The above six winning numbers are the last two digits of the bond number. Anyone holding this bond, whether it is a hundred-yuan ticket, a ten-yuan ticket, or a five-yuan ticket, only needs the last two digits to be the same as the winning number, and can redeem the principal and the current interest from the local China Agricultural and Industrial Banks in Shanghai and Hangzhou and the county governments in Anhui Province at the end of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Factory Inspection Negotiations <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Industry Instructions on Policy</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai factory inspection issue, the Shanghai Municipal Council has requested supervisory and directing authority. The Shanghai Municipal Government has requested instructions from the government. The Ministry of Industry has ordered that the original policy be carried out, adhering to the principle of not losing sovereignty. The Ministry believes that factory inspection is our country's implementation of the Factory Inspection Law within its own territory. In theory, the Municipal Council should not obstruct it. Moreover, our proposal at that time had been slightly modified, with the Municipal Council also sending personnel to participate. However, still wanting to request supervisory and directing authority seems to be an excessive demand. This matter must wait until the Municipal Council Board of Directors meeting when Feixin Dun (transliteration) will report the results of the consultation, and then the Board of Directors will discuss it before a decision can be made. As for factory inspections in other places such as Wuhan, Shanghai, and Qingdao, it will be smoother to implement them after this matter is resolved. The factory inspection plan for the 22nd year is also planned to be started after the resolution. The plan has been sent to the Executive Yuan and should be passed within a few days.</p>

<p>Ministry of Communications Decides to Add New Lines</p>
<p>The spokesperson of the Ministry of Communications said that there are often cases where it takes several hours to connect after registering for a Nanjing-Shanghai long-distance telephone call because the original telephone poles are full. It is not enough to meet the needs without adding new lines. Now the Ministry of Communications has ordered the Nanjing-Shanghai Highway to set up a new line, starting from Nanjing, passing through Jurong, Liyang, Yixing, Wuxi, Changshu, Taicang, Jiading, and reaching Shanghai, 232 miles long. After the line is completed, there will be six telephone return lines. It can be completed and put into service within four months.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in order to crack down on fictitious shipping companies, drafted several suggestions and submitted them to the Ministry, requesting that the Ministry of Industry be consulted for verification and compliance. Yesterday, the Ministry's order was received, stating: "The submission has been noted. The three measures proposed for cracking down on fictitious shipping companies have some inappropriate aspects. The Ministry has revised them based on the circumstances as follows: (1) New shipping bureaus or companies, in addition to complying with the Company Law, should submit to the competent Navigation Administration Bureau for approval the amount of capital prepared, the number and names of ships, a statement indicating whether they are owned or leased, the resumes of the responsible personnel of the shipping bureau or company, and the main operating routes. (2) After a new shipping bureau or company has been reported and approved, all its ships should be declared for measurement or inspection, and business can only commence after certificates have been issued. (3) New shipping bureaus or companies must not engage in any external publicity or advertising before completing the above two procedures. Violators may be informed by the competent Navigation Administration Bureau to the local police station to order a cessation of activities." In addition to consulting with the Ministry of Industry for verification, the order instructs the various shipping industry associations and informs all shipping merchants to comply. The Bureau has already forwarded the order to various shipping companies and offices and sent a letter to the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Prince Wang's Department Cables Request for Ammunition and Supplies Due to Shortages <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Liaison Office of the Third Route of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army recently received a cable from Wang Zezhou, commander of the Second Column of the Route, from the front lines. He reported that the Japanese military police battalion chief, Sawakawababe, and the troops led by Yu Tianmin of the puppet army under Li Shouxin had joined forces in the Yangri and Xinxingzi areas in Rehe Province and were advancing on our army at night. The First Detachment Commander, Wan Kecheng, bravely resisted, engaging in fierce fighting for two days and nights. At dawn on the last day, nine enemy bombers suddenly appeared, dropping dozens of bombs. Unfortunately, nearby villages and houses were destroyed, and over two hundred villagers were killed or injured. Those who could not escape were bombed to death. Detachment Commander Wan Kecheng used Russian-style linked machine guns to shoot down one enemy plane. The remaining planes retreated with injuries. However, due to the intense enemy artillery fire and the shortage of food and ammunition, our army found it difficult to resist. While engaged in hand-to-hand combat, the First Column under Yang Xianfu, stationed at Mojiazi, fortunately rushed to reinforce us, bravely intercepting the enemy and repelling them, thwarting their attack. However, our army is currently short of food and ammunition, so a special cable was sent to the rear requesting supplies and replenishment of military equipment to prepare for any eventuality. Five Japanese officers, thirteen puppet officers, and seventy-two soldiers were captured. In this battle, our army suffered over five hundred casualties. The seriously wounded officers and soldiers have been cared for and sent to the rear for medical treatment through the efforts of Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Those killed in action include Captain Zhai Haiyun, Battalion Adjutant Jiang Yibo, Company Commanders Shi Zhizhong, Company Adjutants Yu Dingyi and Cheng Zhiyuan, Squad Leaders Hu Sien, Qu Liben, and Zhang Dagong, Squad Adjutants Huang Dongsheng, Sheng Zuo, and Bai Deyi, and Platoon Leaders Yang Chonghan and Lü Shiwu. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, and we captured ninety-seven rifles, twelve hand-held weapons, two mortars, three heavy machine guns, two small steel cannons, one tank, and some military supplies.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Disaster Reports from Various Regions Via Letter and Telegram <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Chuansha: A telegram from the Chuansha Flood Relief Association to Du Yuesheng, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, and Huang Hanzhi reads: "Du Yuesheng, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, and Huang Hanzhi, esteemed sirs, Chuansha is unfortunate to have suffered repeated natural disasters. Along the coast, as well as Hengsha, Gaodunsha, and Yuanyuansha, agricultural production is completely wiped out, and houses are washed away, leaving tens of thousands of farmers as refugees without clothing, food, or shelter. The tragic situation is heartbreaking to witness. We previously received relief funds allocated by you, which have been distributed, benefiting the disaster victims. We express our deep gratitude. However, the disaster is severe, and there are many refugees. The relief funds raised may not be widespread enough. We have heard that you will provide ample relief to rescue those in danger, and we are deeply grateful. Faced with the cries of the hungry and distressed, those who are not sick urgently need food and clothing, and those who are sick need medicine. Therefore, we urgently request you to allocate food, clothing, and medicine as soon as possible for distribution to alleviate the immediate crisis, which would be extremely fortunate. Furthermore, our association has appointed gentlemen Zhang Bochu, Huang Jibei, and Chen Jiuyu, who reside in Shanghai, as our representatives in Shanghai. If you have any questions, please contact them nearby. Li Lenggan, Magistrate of Chuansha County and Chairman of the Relief Committee, respectfully." Another telegram to Mu Ouchu, Zou Bingwen, and Xu Jishuang reads: "Mu Ouchu, Zou Bingwen, and Xu Jishuang, esteemed sirs, Chuanyi is unfortunate to have suffered two tidal disasters within half a month. The eighth and ninth coastal districts have become a waterlogged area, and the three islands of Hengsha, Gaodunsha, and Yuanyuansha have been submerged. Currently, disaster victims are everywhere, supporting the old and carrying the young, crying from cold and hunger, living in the open air, in a precarious state. We have heard that you uphold the righteousness of helping disaster-stricken neighbors and practice the benevolence of feeding the hungry and rescuing the drowning, sparing no effort to inspect the disaster areas. We are deeply moved and grateful. If your visit is scheduled, please inform us in advance so that we can follow you and be available for inquiries. We eagerly anticipate your arrival. Li Lenggan, Magistrate of Chuansha County and Chairman of the Relief Committee, respectfully."</p>
<p>Zhenhai: The Ningbo Native Place Association received a disaster report letter from Xu Yong, Magistrate of Zhenhai County, stating: "Zhenyi suffered from two typhoons and rainstorms on the evening of September 1st and 18th, with the 18th being particularly severe. The tide rose sharply, with the water along the river reaching depths of over ten feet. Houses, boats, salt fields, dikes, and dams were severely damaged. Cotton crops failed, and there is no hope for the autumn harvest of rice. The harvest is halved. Disaster-stricken households account for two-tenths of the entire county, approximately 30,000 households. Eight men and women drowned. It is estimated that over 300 brick houses were destroyed, several thousand were partially destroyed, and over 1,000 thatched houses were completely destroyed, with losses of approximately 300,000 yuan. Over 100 boats of various sizes were lost, with losses of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Several thousand salt slabs and 200,000 to 300,000 catties of salt were washed away, along with salt field constructions, estimated at over 100,000 yuan. The outer dikes along the coast were all destroyed, and there are many missing fields in the inner dikes. The coastal area of the entire county spans approximately 200 li. It is estimated that repairs will cost over 500,000 yuan. Over 100,000 mu of cotton fields suffered a complete crop failure, with estimated losses of over 1,200,000 yuan. The rice harvest is halved, with losses of approximately 1,000,000 yuan. The total estimated losses exceed 3,000,000 yuan. After days of investigation, I see devastation everywhere, with wails of distress echoing across the land. It is a rare disaster unseen in decades, even more severe than the autumn disaster of twenty years ago. In addition to urging local autonomous personnel to repair the dikes and dams on the spot and opening all the sluice gates at the same time to drain the saltwater from the inner rivers, I am also advising farmers to use waterwheels to irrigate their fields to wash away the saltwater. At the same time, I am sending telegrams to the provincial authorities requesting disaster relief and planning to organize work relief. However, the provincial and county treasuries are empty. The funds allocated in the future will definitely be limited. Soon it will be mid-winter, and the helpless disaster victims are in danger of freezing and starving. Among the dikes, apart from private dikes, the most important official dikes are the Houhai Dike and the Shitou Dike, with as many as sixty or seventy breaches. The funds required are enormous, and it is difficult to raise them. Fellow villagers from Zhenyi in Shanghai, your concern for your homeland and your empathy are deeply admired. You have always been enthusiastic about public welfare and relief efforts. I am incompetent and of little ability, and I have encountered this great disaster, and I feel guilty for my inability to comfort the people. Therefore, I am reporting the findings of my investigation to you, hoping that you will raise a large sum of money so that the helpless disaster victims in the entire county can have hope for relief and the coastal dikes can be repaired as soon as possible. Your great virtue will be a blessing to the entire county."</p>

<p>After the Wei River in Shaanxi Province flooded, the disaster in Hua County and Dali County was the most severe. The World Red Swastika Society telegraphed the Southeast Headquarters of the Red Swastika Society in Shanghai on the 27th to report the situation. The original telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>Hua County: According to a telegram from the Hua County Relief Branch, "Unfortunately, our county has suffered a devastating flood in the Wei River. The water level suddenly rose to over ten feet, with turbulent waves and an overwhelming force. Nearby areas within a hundred li have become a waterlogged area, sweeping away all lives, property, houses, and graves. Hundreds of people have been killed or injured, and countless livestock have been lost. Over a hundred households have been flooded, especially in Xiaozhangtan, Qinjiatan, Wujiaqiao, and Shilinzhen, where the disaster is most severe. Where the water reaches, steel sand covers the fields, ranging from ten feet deep to several feet shallow. Not only have all the autumn crops been submerged, but even the large trees are half-buried in the sand. The fertile fields have been turned into deserts. Moreover, outside this flood-affected area, various places have also suffered from drought, and all the autumn crops are withered, with little hope of bearing fruit. Tens of thousands of disaster victims are crying out in hunger and cold, which is truly heartbreaking. We hope that benevolent gentlemen and charitable organizations will show great compassion and generously donate relief to save the disaster victims from the water and fire. We eagerly await your response."</p>
<p>Dali County: "On the 8th of last month, sudden wind and rain caused the Luo and Wei Rivers to flood, turning the villages along the banks into waterlogged areas. Eight or nine out of ten disaster victims were soaked, and only one or two out of a hundred personal belongings were salvaged. Dozens of villages have become valleys, and hundreds of disaster victims are crying out in hunger and cold, their voices echoing across the land. It is truly unbearable to witness or hear. Upon investigation, over thirty villages have been flooded, with over 122,000 mu of autumn fields affected, over a hundred people killed or injured, dozens of livestock lost, over 1,340 houses collapsed, and personal belongings lost with a value of over 107,300 yuan, totaling over one million yuan. It is truly a rare disaster unseen in a century. As autumn turns to winter, tens of thousands of disaster victims will inevitably freeze and starve to death. We earnestly request your society to witness the imminent danger and have compassion, and to promptly allocate a large sum of relief funds to save these disaster victims from this dire situation."</p>
<h3 id="e141">Red Swastika Society Collects Cotton Clothes <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Yellow River breached its banks this time, causing serious disasters in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces. Countless people and animals were injured, and villages, communities, and fields were completely washed away. The situation of having no clothes or food is extremely tragic. The Shanghai General Office of the Red Swastika Society recently received a public appeal from the Beijing Red Swastika Society to raise cotton clothes. The appeal is recorded below: "The Yellow River breach has affected several provinces, and the disaster suffered by the people is extremely severe. Our society has previously raised relief funds and appointed personnel to travel to the disaster areas in various provinces in groups to distribute urgent relief. However, as the season turns to autumn and the weather is getting colder, all the compatriots in the disaster areas, whether temporarily gathered in commercial centers or still trapped in the floodwaters, lack supplies for warmth in addition to relief funds and food. The situation is particularly pitiful. Therefore, we are broadly appealing for donations of relief clothing so that it can be transported to various disaster areas for distribution. We hope that people from all walks of life, regardless of gender or age, will donate new or old cotton-padded clothes. Please send them to the Red Swastika Society for collection, and a receipt will be issued for tracking and transportation to the disaster areas for distribution. The merit is immeasurable."</p>

<p>Establishment of a Dredging Committee</p>
<p>Sanlintang Port in Pudong, Shanghai County, is the main river of the county, spanning the border of Nanhui County. Recently, due to years of disrepair, the riverbed has become almost level with the land, not only causing irrigation difficulties and transportation disruptions but also posing problems for firefighting and drinking water. The Fourth District Office of the County, in view of this, believes that if measures are not taken to dredge the river as soon as possible, the future is unimaginable. Therefore, the District Chief, Fu Dianying, reported the situation to the County Government and requested that Nanhui County jointly handle the matter. Therefore, the District Office specially convened the Chambers of Commerce and Security Regiments of the two counties of Shangnan, as well as the relevant district, township, and town chiefs along the river, to discuss the dredging. A meeting was held the day before yesterday to establish a Dredging Committee. The charter was immediately approved, and Shen Shuzhuang, Yao Jiasheng, Fu Dianying, Huo Xusheng, and thirteen others were elected as members.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Joint Water-Land Transportation Between Kunshan and Changshu on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>To Be Implemented from October 1</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway has been actively developing joint water-land transportation in recent years. Recently, it signed a joint transportation contract for passengers, luggage, and parcels with the Yuanyi Steamboat Bureau of Hupu Town, a coastal town in Changshu County, for travel between Qingyang Port Station and Hupu. The main points of the agreement are as follows: (Fare) Shanghai North Station to Qingyang Port: 1.30 yuan for second class, 0.65 yuan for third class, and 0.35 yuan for fourth class. Qingyang Port to Hupu: a flat rate of 0.35 yuan. (Luggage Freight) If the free weight limit is exceeded, a fee of 0.15 yuan will be charged for every 20 kilograms or fraction thereof. (Parcel Freight) Shanghai North to Qingyang Port: 0.007 silver yuan per kilogram, with a minimum charge of 0.20 yuan per piece. Qingyang Port to Hupu: 0.20 silver yuan per 60 kilograms or fraction thereof. (Commission) If the railway's revenue from this joint transportation is less than 5,000 yuan per month, a commission of 1.5% will be given. If it is above 5,000 yuan, a commission of 3% will be given, but no commission will be given for revenue from joint transportation tickets sold by the railway. (Settlement) The joint transportation business will be reported and settled by both parties monthly. (Termination) If the steamboat bureau transfers part or all of the joint transportation business rights to a third party without the written permission of the railway bureau, or if the steamboat bureau violates the railway bureau's regulations, the railway bureau may cancel the contract at any time. The contract stipulates that it will be implemented from October 1st of this year and will be valid for one year. If both parties agree upon expiration, it will be extended.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Two Railway Bureaus Issue Bills of Lading <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Their Nature Is as Valuable Securities</p>
<p>Having the Same Value as Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce recently received a letter from the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, stating: "It has been a long-standing practice for cargo merchants to use railway-issued freight receipts to handle exchange settlements after entrusting the railway to transport goods in order to circulate funds. However, these freight receipts are only vouchers for cargo merchants to pick up goods from the railway and cannot be equated with valuable securities. Therefore, after the railway implemented responsible transportation, it specially ordered a type of voucher called the 'Bill of Lading' for the convenience of cargo merchants handling exchange settlements for reported goods. Its nature has the same value as the goods (as a valuable security) and is specifically for cargo merchants to handle borrowing, lending, or trading. All the articles of association and handling rules were promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Railways in July of last year. As for the procedures for applying for a bill of lading, cargo merchants only need to indicate 'Please issue a bill of lading' in the 'Special Matters' column of the consignment note when filling out the consignment note for entrusting the railway to transport goods, and the railway can do so accordingly. The matter is very simple, and the benefits are very extensive. Fearing that the various forwarding companies may not fully understand the use of this bill of lading, we request that your association forward this notice to promote it as much as possible. Please handle it accordingly."</p>

<p>The 150th Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association held its 150th joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees at its meeting place at the intersection of Route Belles and Route Lafayette in the French Concession at 7:00 PM last night. The attending committee members were Li Ming, Zhang Zhengxue, Zhou Xiaoan, Mao Yun, Chen Zhigao, Shen Junru, Wu Zhengqi, Chen Tingrui, Gao Junxiang, Wang Weizhen, Yang Zhihao, Hu Jue, Ma Junshuo, Wu Kaisheng, and Yan Yinwu. Shen Junru was publicly elected as chairman, and Dai Jixian recorded the minutes. The meeting was conducted as usual. The proposed motions are recorded below: (1) Committee member Zhang Zhengxue reported that the Shanghai Municipal Regulations on Leased Housing, although approved by the Executive Yuan, do not conflict with the law and have been ordered to be handled carefully by the Municipal Government. However, after reviewing Articles 2, 12, and 13 of the regulations, it is clear that they are inconsistent with current laws and infringe upon the powers of the court. Should we continue to request the Executive Yuan to correct them? Please submit this for discussion. Resolution: Resubmit to the Executive Yuan for correction based on legal principles. The text will be drafted by Wang Weizhen, Zhang Zhengzue, and Zhou Shiying. (2) Committee member Zhang Zhengxue reported that Lawyer Xu Mengmei had published advertisements performing his duties without joining the association, which seemed inappropriate. The previous meeting referred this case for review. Now, according to a letter from Lawyer Xu Mengmei, it was declared that a friend had posted it on his behalf and that it was a misunderstanding, so it could be dismissed. Please submit this for discussion. Resolution: Adopted according to the review opinion. (3) Committee members Zhang Zhengxue and Wu Kaisheng reported on the review of the case of Li Chunsen and Ding Zheming, Wen Dairong, submitting reports attacking each other. It is now known that the parties have reached an understanding and should be dismissed. Resolution: Adopted according to the review opinion. (4) The Shanghai Boy Scouts Inspection and Camping Preparatory Committee requested that awards be given to encourage them. Resolution: Filed for record. (5) The Shanghai Municipal Disaster Area Insurance Claim Promotion Association was arrested, interfered with, and injured during the second claim for insurance money. Please advocate for justice. Resolution: Together with the previous letter, it will be forwarded to the Municipal Government, requesting negotiations with the Shanghai Municipal Council. (6) Member Xu Renda reported that lawyers who apply to the court only need to affix a judicial stamp of one dime in addition to the application, but the court often orders the purchase of a lawsuit, which seems to have no legal basis. Please forward this for interpretation. Resolution: Forwarded to the Standing Committee for review and verification. (7) Committee member Wu Zhengqi proposed that this association cooperate with the court, municipal authorities, newspaper association, journalist federation, etc. to find ways to eliminate obscene news. Resolution: After soliciting the consent of various agencies, cooperation will be carried out. (8) Lawyers Xu Mengmei, Lu Zhenyu, and Cao Yongqi applied for membership. Resolution: Passed. (9) The date for this year's autumn committee meeting should be set. Resolution: The autumn committee meeting will be convened at 2:00 PM on October 15th. After the discussion, it was late at night, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e147">The Dispute Over Wage Increase Demands by Fresh Pork Industry Workers Resolved <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Both Parties Signed Ten Conditions</p>
<p>The dispute over the demands by workers in the fresh pork industry in Nanshi to revise the conditions and increase wages was mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau three times. Except for the wage item, both parties agreed to resolve the remaining clauses. The dispute over the issue of wage increases was very fierce. Some workers previously declared a strike because they believed that the capitalists were insincere. The union sent personnel to persuade them to resume work and await mediation. The Social Affairs Bureau was deeply afraid of the expansion of the dispute, so it convened another mediation yesterday. Shen Genshou and Wang Ayin represented the labor side, and Xin Wenyao and Xu Youdi represented the capital side. Dai Youheng of the Municipal Party Department was also present. The meeting was chaired by Pei Yan of the Third Section, and Wang Zhiqin recorded the minutes. First, the chairman consulted the opinions of both parties. After a long period of consultation, it was decided to increase wages by two yuan for those earning below ten yuan, one yuan and twenty cents for those earning below twenty yuan, and one yuan for those earning above twenty yuan. Both parties were satisfied and signed thirteen clauses, announcing that the mediation was successful.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Reactions to the Telephone Price Increase Again <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Letter from the Nanjing Road Citizens Association to the Taxpayers Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association and the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association strongly opposed the Shanghai Telephone Company's price increase in the past. Now that the company has news of another price increase, the association has sent another letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association to express their opposition. The original letter reads: "Recently, Shanghai newspapers have published news that the Shanghai Telephone Company has news of another price increase. Once the Shanghai Municipal Council approves it, the measures will be announced. The telephone is a public transportation undertaking and should be extremely cheap to benefit citizens. Last year, the Shanghai Telephone Company, based on a report by Mr. Anson, which is not suitable for Shanghai's social and economic conditions, and with dubious requests, was rashly approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council to increase prices retroactively to March 27th of the same year, which caused opposition from users. The authorities disregarded this matter so rudely, and users had to reluctantly pay under protest. The case is still pending. However, the company arbitrarily speculated that users had already reached an agreement and then increased prices again in no time, and the measures were not announced in advance, allowing them to do whatever they wanted, which is not the means that a public utility operator should take. Your association is the highest authority for taxpayers in the district and must have been prepared long ago. The failure of the taxpayers' opposition to the telephone price increase last time was due to the fact that various industries with the most users sat back and watched, hoping to reap the benefits of others. However, your association's attitude was too peaceful, and it cannot be spared from criticism. Looking at Shanghai's business, the peace of the Pacific Ocean is threatened by the violence of the Japanese, causing unease among the people. The rural areas of the interior are declining, and there is a lack of purchasing power. Over the years, there has only been decline and no revival. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council, at a meeting of taxpayers, decided not to increase donations this year, but increased all license donations as much as possible. Although the land and house donation rates did not change, their prices were overestimated to implement the donation increase. However, this can still be hoped that the public will use it for taxpayers, and it is only inconsistent with financial principles. As for public utilities, how should the Shanghai Municipal Council protect taxpayers so that they can use them cheaply? In fact, this purpose has not been achieved. The water company agreed to the water company's amendment to the contract, allowing it to increase prices arbitrarily, causing taxpayers to pay a lot of money. The electricity company allowed price increases due to coal prices, but did not order price reductions when coal prices fell. The streetcars and public buses are also the same. It is well known that the authorities have no regard for taxpayers. The Shanghai Telephone Company is taking advantage of this weakness and naturally dares to increase prices again and again and continue to try. The contract can be ignored, and the mutual agreement in the 30th year of the Republic of China can be ignored. In short, all the provisions in the contract that are beneficial to taxpayers are despised by the Shanghai Municipal Council or allowed to be changed. The provisions that are beneficial to public utility companies are vigorously maintained by the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the public opinion of the citizens is disregarded. If this is not fought for, how can it become a city? Therefore, we urgently and directly state this matter, hoping that you will investigate it, seriously negotiate, and not repeat the mistakes of the past. We sincerely hope for public cooperation."</p>
<h3 id="e149">Jiangshun Steamer Harrassment by Inspection in Zhenjiang <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Boarding for Drug Inspection</p>
<p>Hindering the Steamer's Voyage</p>
<p>-China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Submits Report Requesting Strict Prohibition-</p>
<p>The Jiangshun steamer, belonging to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was traveling from Hankou to Shanghai. Upon arriving in Zhenjiang, individuals claiming to be members of a drug inspection team boarded the vessel to conduct an inspection, preventing its departure. Furthermore, they directed the local security force to stage a demonstration against the steamer, creating a serious situation. The on-board military police detained the individuals, who were later released after mediation. The company has now submitted a report to the authorities, requesting that officials investigate and prohibit such actions. The true details of this incident are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Drug Inspection: The Jiangshun steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was returning to Shanghai from Hankou. Upon arriving in Zhenjiang, the ship docked and began loading cargo. Suddenly, several individuals in plainclothes boarded the ship, claiming to be a drug inspection team and demanding to search the Jiangshun steamer. The crew allowed them to search the various cabins, crew quarters, and tea rooms. No contraband was found. By this time, the ship's cargo was loaded, and the captain ordered the anchor to be raised. However, the inspection team insisted on searching the cargo hold and refused to allow the Jiangshun to depart, causing a major disturbance on board. The crew, aware that the ship had a strict schedule that could not be delayed, advised the team to disembark. However, a portion of the inspection team went ashore and summoned a large number of security guards, using force to prevent the ship's departure. The situation quickly descended into chaos.</p>
<p>Three Arrested: The Capital Military Police Headquarters of the Yangtze River Naval Patrol had assigned six military police officers to the steamer to protect the voyage. Hearing of the dispute in the hold, the military police and escort police officers went to investigate. They argued that since no contraband had been found on board, there was no reason to hinder or delay the ship's departure. The military police officers urged the inspection team to go ashore, but they refused and instead clashed with the officers. Considering the inspection team's unreasonable behavior and obstruction of traffic, the military police officers detained the three leaders of the inspection team. The incident was immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau, which dispatched officers to the steamer. After hearing the crew's account of the situation, the bureau officers mediated the situation and ordered the military police officers to release the three detained inspectors. At the same time, the inspectors were ordered to issue a letter of reconciliation, which was signed by both parties to conclude the matter.</p>
<p>Disturbance in Tongzhou: After the Jiangshun steamer departed from Zhenjiang, it was hoped that it would be able to proceed peacefully. However, the inspectors were apparently still bitter and sent a telegram from Zhenjiang to the Tongzhou security force, instructing them to detain the Jiangshun steamer upon its arrival and prevent it from passing through. As a result, when the Jiangshun arrived in Tongzhou, the local security force was on the riverbank, aiming their guns at the ship as if preparing to fire. The passengers on board, unaware of the situation, were terrified. The Tongzhou agency office inquired about the cause of the situation and reported it to the county government. The county government sent officials to the scene to explain the true nature of the inspectors' instigation and disturbance to the security force, advising the guards not to engage in such actions and to withdraw. The captain of the Jiangshun steamer (a Westerner), seeing many armed men on the shore aiming guns at the ship in a threatening manner, also took out his own handgun, preparing to return fire. The security guards on the riverbank then fled in a panic, and the ship was able to depart for Shanghai.</p>
<p>Reported to the Authorities for Strict Prohibition: Recently, various company steamers traveling downstream to Shanghai have frequently been subjected to harassment by self-proclaimed drug inspection teams in the Zhenjiang and Tongzhou area. These teams board the ships to conduct searches and engage in various forms of abuse. Most of these team members are in plainclothes and do not wear uniforms. Some have even beaten the tea room attendants and stokers, and this has happened more than once. Jardine Matheson's steamer has even had to deal with the situation. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's steamers have also been disturbed several times. Yesterday, the company reported the situation to the authorities, requesting an investigation into the existence of such a drug inspection team and urging strict prohibition to ensure the safety of travelers and the maintenance of the shipping industry.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Shanghai Search for Murderer in Dalian Suitcase Case <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>But No Clues to Be Found</p>
<p>A Dentsu dispatch from Osaka on the 28th reports that, according to local newspapers, Dr. Kodama has confessed to being an accessory in the Dalian suitcase murder case. He stated that at 9 p.m. that night, Nakazono and Aoyagi, along with Aoyagi's wife, Ms. Katsumi, went to a dance hall. Nakazono saw Aoyagi and Ms. Katsumi being very intimate and began arguing in the dance hall. Because they were in a public place, they did not make too much of a scene and went together to Dr. Kodama's house. They continued arguing in front of Kodama. Despite his attempts to dissuade them, they did not listen. Aoyagi demanded an apology from Nakazono, but Nakazono refused, and they began fighting. Nakazono, in a fit of anger, fought violently and eventually killed Aoyagi. Kodama could not bear to watch and helped Nakazono commit the crime, cutting up the body, packing it in a suitcase, and transporting it to Ms. Yokoyama's house to hide. Ms. Yokoyama knew about the crime and hid the body. Nakazono and Ms. Katsumi fled Dalian. Kodama stated that he had been unwilling to reveal the truth until now out of concern for his reputation and position. However, the matter has come to this point, and he has no choice but to tell the truth. The Osaka Police Department firmly believes that the murderer is still hiding in Osaka and today mobilized 16 armed commandos to lie in wait at Osaka Station. Any male and female passengers found sitting on the same chair in a passenger car are questioned about their origin if they do not have business cards. It is said that many newlyweds have been inconvenienced, and jokes have been made everywhere.</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that, after the suitcase murder case was discovered in Dalian three days ago, it was said that the murderer Nakazono had left Dalian and might have come to Shanghai. Therefore, the police of the Japanese Consulate General in this city yesterday searched everywhere for Nakazono's whereabouts, but no clues have been found. It is currently suspected that Nakazono may have returned to Japan to make it easier to hide. However, as of last night, the Japanese Consulate in this city had not received any information from its home country regarding Nakazono's whereabouts. The Japanese community in this city is paying close attention to this case due to its bizarre circumstances. According to information from Dalian, the deceased Aoyagi and the suspect Nakazono were both lovers of Dr. Kodama's wife, who was the director of the pathology department at the South Manchuria Railway Hospital. They even fought in front of Kodama and his wife. After Nakazono killed Aoyagi, he dismembered the body, placed it in a suitcase, and moved it to the house of his former lover, Ms. Yokoyama. Twenty days later, the authorities discovered the body, arrested Ms. Yokoyama, and learned the details of the case. They immediately sent out telegrams to arrest the suspects. It is said that Kodama's wife, a key figure in the case, fled to Japan after the incident and is expected to be apprehended soon.</p>

<p>Judge Opens Preliminary Hearing Yesterday Due to Complex Facts</p>
<p>Defendants Mostly Shirk Responsibility and Deny Everything</p>
<p>Su Kunian Wears Short Cloth Coat, Looking Like a Shop Assistant</p>
<p>Presiding Judge Says Su Normally Rides in Cars and Lives Lavishly</p>
<p>-Four Hours of Interrogation, Overcrowded Gallery-</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs clerks and Ningbo native Su Kunian organized the "Huatou" United Company at No. 3 Hankou Road, colluding with customs brokers from foreign firms to forge Jianghai Customs declarations. The clerks then secretly replaced the genuine declarations, embezzling large amounts of customs duties, amounting to tens of thousands of yuan. Shu Bo, Deputy Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Department, discovered the fraud and notified the Water Police Department. Chief Inspector Peng Shi and Chinese Detective Cheng Yongnian investigated and confirmed the details, leading to a raid on the company and the arrest of Su Kunian, clerks Shi Cunqiao, Wang Yueren, Wei Anxiang, Jiang Zhenhai, Zhang Songtao, Sun Guozhang, Chen Zhongshan, and Chen Guoliang, a customs broker from the China Soap Company, as well as seven other fugitives, including Han Jincai, who are currently wanted. Prosecutor Ouyang Shu investigated and confirmed the details, and filed a public prosecution for forgery of official documents and embezzlement of national taxes. Su Kunian was also found to be a habitual offender and will be prosecuted more severely. Yesterday afternoon at 1:30 p.m., Qian Chengjun, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Court, opened the third courtroom for the trial. The defendants hired defense attorneys Qu Yue, Jin Yu, and Zhang Enbin, while the Customs hired attorney Jiang Yiping as their agent for the attached civil suit. Because this case is a rare major case, the gallery was overcrowded. The presiding judge ordered the defendants and witnesses Peng Shi and Shu Bo to the court, and then announced that due to the complexity of the facts, a preliminary hearing would be held first.</p>
<p>First, Peng Shi, 42 years old, British, Criminal Chief of the Water Police, resident of the Pudong Customs Warehouse, was questioned. "How was this case discovered?" He replied, "By the Commissioner of Customs of the Anti-Smuggling Section of the Customs." "What was discovered?" He replied, "Customs documents and declarations were stolen, and fake ones were used to replace the real ones." "How many declarations were lost?" He replied, "When it was discovered, we found that a real one had been replaced with a fake one, and the real one was found during a search of the United Company on Sanma Road." "What was declared?" He replied, "A car." "What was the estimated value?" He replied, "I don't remember the exact amount." The official ordered the evidence to be examined and two real and fake declarations were presented. He stated, "The fake one was found at the Customs, and the real one was found by the First Special District Court during a search of the United Company." "Are there any other real or fake declarations?" He replied, "There are many other items that were copied by the United Company. After we, the police, copied them, we handed them over to the Customs for their own investigation." Peng Shi only knew about the car incident; the Customs Commissioner of Customs was more clear about the details. "Which section is in charge of the declarations?" He replied, "It goes through several places, so I can't be sure."</p>
<p>"Who is in charge of the declaration?" He replied that it goes through a couple of different places, he couldn't be sure. The judge then questioned Shu Bo, 36 years old, Norwegian, Deputy Customs Officer of the Anti-Smuggling Division, resident at No. 139 Rue Grorosa, French Concession. "How long have you been in this position?" He replied, "Only six months." "How did you know about the tax evasion?" He replied, "It is our specialized duty." "How did you first find out?" He replied, "We investigated merchants and suspected that there were irregularities at the United Company at No. 3 Hankou Road." "Did you go to the search?" He replied, "I did not go." "When was it?" He replied, "July 20th." "How many real and fake declarations did you find?" He replied, "I don't remember exactly, but everything we found was sent to your court. The first thing we discovered was a car declaration on the printing platform, and the real one was found in the United Company." At this point, the judge questioned Kunian, 26 years old, from Zhenhai, an employee of the United Company and an export broker, resident at No. 4 Huixing Lane, Xihuade Road. "Who opened the United Company?" He replied, "Shao Pengfei opened it." "How many people opened it?" He replied, "One person." "What do you do there?" "I help with export goods." "How long have you been doing it?" He replied, "Two months." "You previously stated that you were an assistant." He replied, "I did not say that." "The crime is not about the employee or assistant, and the statement has your fingerprint. Are you friends with Wang Xiangwen and Jiang Wenyi, whom the court has previously dealt with?" He replied, "Yes, I am." The judge said, "It can be seen that you are habitually unlawful and cannot be forgiven. You committed the same crime with them before, but were not punished, so you went to the United Company to do unlawful things again." He replied, "I only went for a few months." The judge said, "In short, your crimes are irrefutable. You should tell the truth, and perhaps there is a possibility of leniency. What did the boss ask you to do?" He replied, "Send letters." "Where to?" "To the Customs." "To whom?" "Sometimes to Ji Cunqiao, sometimes to Jiang Zhenhai, and the others I can't remember at the moment." "How many times a month do you forge Customs declarations?" He replied, "I don't know." "How many times do you send letters?" He replied, "Two or three times a month." "You previously said that you and the Customs clerks and customs brokers from the foreign firms organized a group to steal blank declarations, fill them out, and send them in." He replied, "I was beaten and could not say anything." The judge said, "You think that you are wearing a short cloth coat today, looking like a shop assistant, but this court has long been aware of your acts of misconduct and extravagance in taking cars on weekdays. You should tell the truth, and the court may be able to show mercy. How did you replace the real declarations with fake ones?" He replied, "I don't know." "If you don't know, how did you point out these eight people as being involved and say that the company gets 10%, the clerks get 25%, and the customs brokers get 35%? These are things that cannot be fabricated." He replied, "I couldn't help it. I said it because I was beaten." "According to what you said today, Shi Cunqiao and Jiang Zhenhai are already ironclad cases. How many times have you handled them?" He replied, "None." "This kind of case is not a case of theft, perhaps it was a coerced confession. How would you understand this kind of thing if you hadn't experienced it? Therefore, if the confession does not match the facts, it can also be declared innocent. But your confession matches the facts. In any case, it is difficult to escape the law. If you can tell the truth, perhaps your intentions can be forgiven and you can be treated with leniency. But now you are just trying to be cunning, which shows that your intentions are evil. So the fault lies with you, the most important person. Moreover, you confessed to the prosecutor that the boss, Shao Pengfei, asked me to commit fraud at the Customs. Did people fabricate this confession?" He replied, "I did not say that." "Which foreign firms did your United Company report?" He replied, "Baohe Foreign Firm." "Not just one?" He replied, "My boss's private affairs, I don't know." "You previously said that it was Meizuishi, Kaili, Yuxingxiang, Xincheng, and many other firms, why not today?" "The prosecutor saw it on the register and recorded it." "This is your confession, where is this kind of thing? Therefore, the co-defendants Xia Lanfang and your brother Su Kangnian, etc., are all people you claimed were apprentices, who did not know the content and were acquitted. You acquitted your comrades, still want to be cunning?" "You also said that on July 14th, Ruirui imported 280 cars." He replied, "I did not say that." "How did you get to know Chen Guoliang?" He replied, "I have never seen him." "You often eat at that restaurant on Fourth Avenue." He replied, "Jiya." The judge said, "Are you such an extravagant and meticulous shop assistant? And you, Shi Cunqiao, Wei Anxiang, etc., eat at which restaurant?" He replied, "I don't know." The judge said, "Since you went to the restaurant, there is no reason not to know. You are just being cunning. Who did you eat with this time?" He replied, "The Baohe Foreign Firm, Mr. Gu." The judge then reprimanded Su severely and ordered him to be taken down, and then questioned Shi Cunqiao, 23 years old, from Yin County, a clerk at the Customs Evaluation Office, resident at No. 10 Shanlong Lane, Quanjia'an Road, Diswei Road. "How long have you been working?" He replied, "One year and two months. I used to be a messenger for the shipowner." "What year did you start working?" He replied, "1930." The judge then reprimanded him angrily, "You are Chinese, you are just a clerk, and you have forgotten your roots and even forgotten your own year? What year is the Republic of China?" He replied, "The Republic of China is the 20th year." "How much is your monthly salary?" He replied, "37 yuan." "How did you get to know Su Kunian and Shao Pengfei?" He replied, "I don't know them." "Are you still working as a clerk?" He replied, "Yes, I am." "Are you in charge of the declarations at the Evaluation Office?" He replied, "There are five of us, I am only in charge of small verifications." "On the 17th, did you go to the Hezuo Company with Wang Yueren and Wei Anxiang?" He replied, "No, I did not go." "What did you say in front of the prosecutor?" He replied, "The prosecutor copied the statement from the Water Police Department." The judge then shouted in shock and scolded, "There is no such thing, it is obviously cunning." He replied, "The Water Police Department forced me to confess." "Why didn't you report the injury at the time?" He replied, "I was already scared by the instruments of torture before I was beaten." The judge said, "This is obviously nonsense. You also said that Su Kunian gave you 1,800 yuan on the 17th, and you three split it, each getting 600 yuan. This is in the prosecutor's confession, you can't deny it." At this point, Wang Yueren, 26 years old, from Shanghai, Jianghai Customs clerk, resident at No. 40 Hongqiao, was questioned. "I am a clerk at the import inspection platform, I don't know Su Kunian." "Which department does the inspection platform belong to?" He replied, "The General Affairs Department." "What does it do?" He replied, "It fills in the tax silver on the blank declarations." "Are you familiar with Wei Anxiang and Shi Cunqiao?" He replied, "Yes, I am." "What did you do at the Hezuo Company on the 17th?" He replied, "I didn't go." "Why did Shi Cunqiao confess you?" He replied, "There is no such thing." "Did you steal the declaration or did Shi steal it?" He replied, "I didn't steal it." "You got one hundred yuan, did you get eaten by someone? How long have you been doing it?" He replied, "I didn't do it." "You previously confessed that you, Wei Anxiang, and Shi Cunqiao received a total of 1,800 yuan, don't deny it. Who initiated it, did Su Kunian come to seduce you?" He replied, "We did not say, the prosecutor only asked for our names and ages, and did not ask anything else." The judge said, "You are spreading this kind of rumor, there is no such thing, you are all cunning traitors." At this point, Wei Anxiang, 26 years old, from Shanghai, resident at No. 6 Anping Lane, Fangbang Road, Nanyang Bridge, was questioned. "I am a clerk on the third floor of the Customs, I have been there for three and a half years, and my monthly salary is 37 yuan." "Do you know Shi Cunqiao and Wang Yueren?" He replied, "I know them." "Are you on good terms?" He replied, "Yes, we are." "How many of you stole the declaration?" He replied, "I don't know." "How did you previously confess that Wang Yueren went to steal, and you kept watch?" He replied, "I said that after the Water Police threatened me." "How did you confess at the Prosecutor's Office?" He replied, "The prosecutor copied the confession from the police station." At this point, the judge questioned Jiang Zhenhai, also known as Jiang Zhenhan, 30 years old, from Yancheng, resident at No. 28 Xiangguang Lane, Xihuade Road, formerly a clerk on the third floor of the Customs, who stopped working on May 30th of this year. "When were you arrested by the Water Police?" He replied, "Sometime in July, I was sick at home." "Who are you familiar with?" He replied, "I am most familiar with Wei Anxiang, the rest are just colleagues." "When did you meet Su Kunian?" He replied, "One day, the Chinese secretary of the Commissioner of Customs, Mr. Wu Xirong, asked me to send a letter to the Evaluation Office, where I met him." "So Su often comes?" He replied, "I don't know." "He asked you to take the declaration?" He replied, "I am only sending letters." "How did Shi Cunqiao confess that you were involved?" He replied, "During the Shanghai War, he said that I, a native of Jiangbei, was a traitor, and I said that he, a native of Ningbo, was a real traitor, so we fought. He deliberately framed me out of hatred." "Did Shi Cunqiao ever bite you, or did you admit it yourself? And you introduced Wei Anxiang and Su Kunian, because he asked you to steal, but the declaration did not pass through your hands, so you introduced Wei into it." He replied, "This was also bitten by Shi Cunqiao." At this point, Zhang Qiutao, 36 years old, from Nanhui, resident at No. 26 Yongzhen Lane, Gongyi Pier, Jianghai Customs clerk on the second floor, who is in charge of ordering tax bills, was questioned. "The staff will hand it down after ordering the tax bill, and we will send it to the tax registration desk after ordering it. Where does it end up?" He replied, "The printing platform." "What station do you manage?" He replied, "The starting station, Chen Zhongshan manages the tax registration desk." "How long have you been working?" He replied, "Twenty years." "You stole the declaration?" He replied, "I don't know, I was truly wronged. How did it involve me?" He replied, "That's really strange." "Do you know Shao Pengfei?" He replied, "I don't know him." "Do you know Han Jincai?" He replied, "Yes, he used to be a colleague." "What was he doing at your house that day?" He replied, "My sister-in-law was suing, I didn't see him." "What about Su Kunian?" He replied, "One day, Su was wearing black clothes, like a rogue, at 4:30 in the afternoon, when office hours had ended, he stood by the starting station, I thought he was a thief stealing things, so I questioned him and there was a conflict, so he bore a grudge and bit me." At this point, Sun Guozhang, 27 years old, from Nantong, resident at No. 19 Deming Lane, Dongpushe Road, Jianghai Customs clerk on the fourth floor, was questioned. "I specialize in writing declaration numbers." "Who orders the declarations?" He replied, "Wan Shougen." "How many orders at a time?" He replied, "One order per ship name." "How did you get to know Su Kunian?" He replied, "I met him in the waiting room a month ago." "Is there any connection between you and stealing the declaration?" He replied, "No, my declaration is already ordered and completed, and it cannot be torn off. Which section are you in?" He replied, "The document management room of the General Affairs Section, which is the last place." At this point, Chen Zhongshan, 33 years old, from Nanhui, resident at No. 25 Yuyuan Lane, XinJia Road, Jianghai Customs clerk on the first floor, was questioned. "Are you more familiar with Sun Guozhang or other people?" He replied, "The same." "What about Zhang Qiutao and you?" He replied, "We work at the same desk. What does the starting station do?" He replied, "Send the bill to the tax registration desk. I don't know Su Kunian, but one day at 4:30 in the afternoon, he was at the starting station and asked the supervisory station to collect tax silver, but it was too late, so I had a conflict." The judge said, "You were also implicated by Su Kunian." At this point, Chen Guoliang, 25 years old, from Chuansha, a customs broker from the China Soap Company, resident at No. 295 Weihaiwei Road, was questioned. "How did you get to know Chen Amao?" He replied, "He used to be a customs broker, he quit last year, and I took over." "Do you know Su Kunian?" He replied, "I don't know him." "Was he introduced by Chen Amao?" He replied, "I have never seen this person." "This is your original confession, this has nothing to do." He replied, "The introduction is an introduction, but I don't know what he does." "Where are the 600 barrels of Duxiang from?" He replied, "From the company." "How much tax was paid?" He replied, "More than 3,000 yuan." "Did you pay the Customs with a check?" He replied, "I took the customs bill, drew a check, and sent it to the Customs, and it was reported to the Maotai Foreign Firm. "You said earlier that Chen Amao reported it on your behalf." He replied, "When I went, it was 3:30, and Amao said it was too late, so he took it to the upper floor for me." "What year did you pay him 400 yuan?" He replied, "He borrowed it from my father." At this point, the judge ordered a retrial at a later date, and the defendants were taken back into custody. It was already 5:30.</p>

<p>Don't Know How Many Fetuses Have Been Harmed</p>
<p>Truly a Scourge to the People</p>
<p>-Zhang Himself Is on the Run, His Assistant Is Detained-</p>
<p>Zhang Lexuan, who lives at No. 250 Hankou Road, claims to be proficient in Huangdi's medical skills, especially good at performing abortions for women. Therefore, the abortion medical fees he charges are fixed amounts, based on the length of pregnancy. For example, if the pregnancy is only one month, the fee is five yuan; two months, ten yuan, and so on, rarely increasing or decreasing easily. If the aborted woman requires a guarantee that there will be no danger to her life, then the fees he charges are not fixed, depending on the person. For wealthy families, he demands exorbitant prices, but the lowest price is no less than two or three hundred gold. Since Zhang has used his skills to practice medicine, he has harmed an unknown number of fetuses, truly a scourge to the people and a scorpion of society. Recently, his secret was discovered by Xu Zexin, a detective from the Laozha Police Station, who wanted to collect evidence of his crimes and specially visited a pregnant woman, Ms. Lin, and ordered her to try it first. On the 7th of this month, Ms. Lin quietly went alone and arrived at his clinic, where she was received by Liu Gongwei, a Ningbo native hired by Zhang as an assistant. After Liu asked about her purpose, he went into the room and called Zhang out. Zhang first examined the woman's pulse and then said to the woman that the fetus in her belly was already five months old. If it needs to be aborted, each month will be charged five yuan, totaling 15 yuan. Ms. Lin then asked if she could be guaranteed no danger after the abortion, and Zhang said that abortion is painless, but if insurance is required, the medical expenses should be 200 yuan. Ms. Lin then pretended to say that the price was too high, and that she would consider it again and leave. Two days later, she returned to discuss the price, and Zhang reduced it to 18 yuan. Ms. Lin paid ten yuan first, obtained the medicinal powder, medicinal water, and the receipt written by Zhang, which included a guarantee of no danger, and handed it all over to Detective Xu, who turned it over to the police chief. Since the evidence was complete, the matter should be strictly investigated. He also ordered the detective to rush to arrest him yesterday, but Zhang had keen ears and fled when he heard the news. Only Liu Gongwei, who assisted in the abortion, was taken back to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Local Court, where he was interrogated by Judge Zhan Liangce. After the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the circumstances, he also stated that the medicine and powder obtained by the woman had been chemically examined and were all fake medicines. Therefore, the defendant was actually committing fraud, not just performing abortions, and should be severely punished. Ms. Lin was also brought to the case to testify to everything. When questioned, Liu confessed, "I originally worked at the Zuolin Hospital opened by Li Zuolin, but I was invited by Zhang to assist. Now Zhang has escaped," and so on. Judge Zhan then ordered the defendant to be detained and set a later date for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Borrowing the Venue: The society's letter to the Jingwu Athletic Association stated: "Regarding the Northeast war zone, which has long been ravaged by war, leaving disaster victims displaced and homeless, our association members have initiated fundraising for relief to fulfill our duty.

<h3 id="e155">Japanese Yarn Passing Off as Domestic Goods: Ten Factories Vigorously Avoid Litigation <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Fearing Legal Sanctions, They Seek Reconciliation with Influential Figures</p>
<p>Yesterday, after Lengthy Negotiations, a Fine Was Paid to Assist in Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Whether There Are Other Understandings on Shenxin's Side Remains Unclear</p>
<p>Whether the Consolidated Tax Office Will Pursue the Matter is Key to the Case</p>
<p>Ten factories, including Gong Zu, recently reported the transport of Japanese yarn as domestic goods to the Consolidated Tax Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region. The bureau discovered this and notified Shenxin Factory No. 5. Consequently, the factory filed a criminal self-accusation against Yu Xifan, the manager of the ten factories, in the First Special District Court. Recently, those ten factories, including Yu Xifan, Chen Zhongxian, Wang Liwei, Sun Xizu, Yu Yuxin, Zhou Songmao, Chai Zhixiang, Zhao Bingnan, Wang Gensheng, and Guan Bingqing, fearing that once involved in litigation, they would inevitably be subject to national law, spent their days seeking reconciliation everywhere and making great efforts to cover up the matter to avoid being abandoned by the public. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that yesterday, Zhang Zilian, Ge Shengru, and Zhu Wenqi came forward to invite the parties involved and mediators to meet at the Atlantic Vegetable Club. After four hours of private discussions, Shenxin expressed its acceptance of the reconciliation. It is rumored that the compensation from the ten factories to Shenxin will be used to provide funds to the Yellow River Flood Disaster Relief Society. Afterwards, reporters inquired with Sun Zuji, the plaintiff's lawyer, about the mediation process. He stated that it was indeed the case. When asked about the compensation for Factories No. 5 and No. 9, he said that it had not been discussed. When asked whether the two parties had signed any agreements, he said that it was only a verbal agreement. Therefore, whether the matter will be resolved so simply is still unclear, and we will continue to investigate and record. As for some people saying that the ten factories' act of passing off Shenxin's products as their own is now a fait accompli, and if Shenxin insists on compensation for past losses, the ten factories will inevitably go bankrupt, these are all one-sided arguments. The fact that the ten factories took such a great risk and were discovered, even leading to legal action, proves the crimes of these unscrupulous merchants. It is even more difficult to allow them to escape the law in order to warn others in the future. Therefore, if the ten factories were to go bankrupt as a result, they would deserve it. At the same time, Shenxin's acceptance of the reconciliation is unwise. As for the Consolidated Tax Office, it was the first to discover the case. To maintain the prestige of the national authority, it is currently collecting evidence and preparing to punish the ten factories for their due crimes. Therefore, the future outcome of the case, and whether the unscrupulous merchants will be subject to legal sanctions, depends entirely on the attitude of the Consolidated Tax Office.</p>

<p>The dancer Chen Hailun, because Xu Qizhong, the son of Xu Guannan, a prominent family in Wuxian County, terminated their cohabitation agreement halfway through, Xu should bear 30,000 yuan in alimony to Chen Hailun according to the original agreement. Not only did Xu Qizhong not fulfill the agreement, but he also avoided meeting her. Therefore, Chen often went to the Xu family on Beijiang Road to demand the money, but to no avail. Unexpectedly, on the 24th of this month, when Chen, along with her mother and grandmother, went to the Xu family to demand the expenses, Chen's mother was suddenly beaten and injured by the Xu family's doorman. Chen could not resist and had to take her mother to Dr. Li's office for a medical certificate in order to pursue legal action. According to Chen's statement to reporters yesterday, she has already hired lawyer Yan Luqing to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, accusing the Xu father and son of instigating the assault.</p>

<p>Since the national crisis, Sun Zhesheng, President of the Legislative Yuan, has often encouraged the people to concentrate national strength. All knowledgeable people admire this, as the Sino-Japanese conflict has entered a period of national strength confrontation. If China wants to seek long-term resistance and achieve the final victory of avenging its humiliation, it must first concentrate its national strength. President Sun's encouragement to the people is also intended for this purpose. Recently, the China National Products Production and Sales Alliance Company, initiated by people from Shanghai's financial and industrial circles, is an organization that builds national product productivity. It is extremely detailed in its planning for economic development, safeguarding people's livelihoods, and is highly praised by President Sun. Yesterday, he specially sent a letter to the company's preparatory office, joining as a sponsor. The original letter is recorded below: "Regarding the receipt of your letter and plan, etc., I understand everything. You gentlemen, based on the spirit of cooperation, seek coordination between production and sales, and initiate the China National Products Production and Sales Alliance Company. Your grand plan is well thought out and sure to succeed. Commerce benefits workers, and industry relies on it. I am willing to be a sponsor. Please list my name. To the Preparatory Office of the China National Products Production and Sales Alliance Company."</p>

<p>Do Not Give Tips to Police Officers and Servants</p>
<p>Those Who Consider It Bribery Will Be Severely Punished If Discovered</p>
<p>Jiangsu High Court Second Branch, Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court, Proclamation No. 937 states: "Upon investigation, if the process servers of the two courts demand more than the prescribed amount for serving documents, or if the bailiffs and servants solicit tips from litigants, it is a violation of court discipline. We have repeatedly issued proclamations ordering them to be reported at any time for strict punishment. However, it is heard that some litigants are still accustomed to the practices of the former government offices and voluntarily pay extra or give tips even without being solicited, calling it a reward. Little do they know that these police officers and servants are employed by the court and receive corresponding salaries. Their service to the parties involved is a matter of their duty, and the parties involved have no need to reward them. If rewards are given rashly, it will only encourage their non-essential desires. Those who do not give rewards will inevitably harbor thoughts of solicitation, or because of the existence of rewards, the treatment will be clearly divided into thick and thin, which is detrimental to both the public interest and the court discipline. If they receive property for actions in the line of duty, which can be considered bribery, they will be severely punished once discovered and verified. Thickening them will only harm them, and those who offer bribes will also be prosecuted. Therefore, we hereby notify all litigants that they must not give any tips to police officers and servants beyond the prescribed amount. Do not cause inconvenience. Everyone must comply. This is hereby proclaimed. September 23rd, Republic of China 22nd year, Court President Shen Jiayi, Court President Guo Yunguan."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent a letter to the Secretary General of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "We have received a letter from the Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Coordination Association, which stated that the member of our association's claims committee, Song Liangcai, was arrested and assaulted previously. We are grateful that your council has made serious representations. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 25th, more than 200 disaster victims from our association went to the insurance department of the Tienshian &amp; Co. on Wuma Road to seek compensation. The responsible police station dispatched dozens of Chinese and foreign detectives who not only failed to provide protection but also brutally beat and injured the disaster victims seeking compensation, almost causing a second May Thirtieth Incident. Among those seriously injured were Feng Qibiao, Zhang Ziming, Cai Tongshan, Lin Gen, and Chen Zhaojin, all of whom have been sent to the Second Branch of the Red Cross Society for treatment. The police station repeatedly used such violent and cruel means against the unarmed disaster victims who were seeking legitimate compensation. Where is justice? Where is humanity? We request that your council negotiate seriously with the Shanghai Municipal Council to request appropriate punishment, and that the situation does not escalate.

<p>Qian Yi Enterprise Silver Company unites the financial, industrial, and engineering sectors to seek benefits for society. It is organized by influential figures in the financial world. After the reorganization, in view of the fact that the financial, industrial, and engineering sectors have never had the opportunity to communicate, it is dedicated to enterprise investment and has formed a technical cooperation committee composed of specialists to support enterprises, improve production, reward inventions, and promote sales. It has also contacted various domestic goods factories to provide a place for experts to implement their abilities. After many days of preparation, it held an inaugural meeting at the company the other day. Those present included Zhuang Zhihuan, Zhi Bingyuan, Lu Chengyao, Li Qianjun, Zhang Yanyu, Huang Bingkui, Wang Shiqiang, Shi Zhaohan, and other well-known engineering experts in China, as well as company directors He Gusheng, Wang Boyuan, Liang Chenlan, Chen Xiaodie, Sun Hegao, and others, forming a unified whole. They are now actively working and will be the hub of the financial, industrial, and engineering sectors to seek social welfare. The articles of association are recorded below:</p>
<p>Design Service Articles of Association: This company, in order to facilitate entrepreneurs or inventors to combine capital and achieve twice the results with half the effort, has established a technical cooperation association, which is divided into twelve types: machinery, chemistry, electricity, ceramics, mining and metallurgy, civil engineering, agriculture and forestry, architecture, cotton weaving, silk weaving, wool weaving, printing and dyeing. The company hires experts to form a technical cooperation committee, which specializes in designing, consulting, and connecting work for the members of the association in order to improve products and increase production. In addition to the technical cooperation and the articles of the technical cooperation committee being determined separately, the design service methods are now specially stipulated as follows: (A) Enterprise Design: (1) Entrepreneurs who are willing to invest a certain amount of capital and hope to receive a certain annual interest rate, who have certain necessary conditions, or who can hold a certain position, may entrust this company in writing to introduce investment in a corresponding enterprise or entrust this company to design it.

<p>The China Fertilizer Company's business location is at 105 Jiangxi Road and hires agricultural experts to actively improve China's original organic fertilizer, which is entirely domestic. Since its establishment, its business has been very developed. Merchants from all over the country who are willing to promote and sign management contracts are endless. The company also cooperates with local agencies and gentry in Changzhou to promote it together. It was not long before sales reached more than 3,000 bags. The company's products are excellent, and farmers are happy to use domestic products, so this result is within expectations. It is heard that the company is now planning to organize fertilizer loan cooperatives in various provinces and counties in order to remedy the rural economy. In order to facilitate the process, it is willing to contact various agencies, groups, and schools in various places to cooperate. It is heard that the procedures are extremely simple, that is, the fertilizer produced by the company is loaned to farmers, and after the harvest is over, the farmers return the fertilizer they borrowed at a settled price. If this is done, the rural economy will be able to be remedied to a small extent. It is hoped that various agencies, group schools, and gentlemen who are interested in studying agriculture will unanimously support and cooperate together to break a bloody path in the weakening of agriculture in China, which is on the verge of collapse, and compete with imported goods.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Witness Ma Fengting Implicated in Jia Lin's Marital Dispute <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Detained Overnight for Insulting a Public Official</p>
<p>Wu Bin, courtesy name Chuba, an official of the First Section of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and a native of Anhui Province, recently married a young woman named Jia Lin (号 Huixian) in the capital. Suddenly, Lin Xianjian, a native of Guangdong and the director of the Xianjian Hospital on Jiangxi Road in this city, claimed that Jia was his wife. Consequently, when Wu and Jia came to Shanghai, he accused them of bigamy. The First Special District Court issued a summons for the defendants to appear in court for interrogation. Because Jia Lin only admitted to cohabiting with Lin Xianjian, she cited Ma Fengting (also known as Ma Fengting), the doorman at No. 216 Fusheng Lane, Bazi Road, as a witness. Therefore, the court specifically issued a summons for Ma to appear in court as a witness during the second hearing. Unexpectedly, Ma was naturally crude and timid, and was unwilling to get involved in such matters that had nothing to do with him. When the time for the court hearing came, he refused to appear and spoke disrespectfully to the public official who served the summons, showing no courtesy. The public official reported the facts to the court, which then issued an arrest warrant. The day before yesterday afternoon, Ma was arrested and detained in the General Patrol Room. Yesterday morning, he was taken to the First Special Court, where Judge Qian interrogated him. According to Ma, he knew nothing about how Lin Xianjian and Jia Huixian came together. The court set the date for the continued hearing of the bigamy case as October 7th, and ordered Ma to return home, but he should surrender himself to the court for questioning when the time came. Ma's overnight detention can truly be described as being caught in the crossfire.</p>

<p>"Memoirs of a European Tour," published by the China Travel Service, is a record of Mr. Chu Minyi's travels in Europe, recalling what he saw and heard. Mr. Wu Jingheng wrote in the preface: "This is another remarkable book about human activities on Earth, a publication that can provide people with lingering memories and evoke infinite emotions, and will certainly not let Sima Qian say 'how and how'. It can beautify the past." It can be seen that the value of this book is high. Monte Carlo is the first collection of Mr. Song Chunfang's travel notes, containing twelve articles about France, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, and China, etc. The first article is about Monte Carlo, the world's largest gambling resort in France, hence the name. The writing style is clear and elegant, forming its own unique style. "Like Passing Years" is a masterpiece by the famous novelist Mr. Zhang Henshui, describing the psychology of young people in their pursuit of education, career, and love. The deep emotions make people yearn, and the sadness makes people grieve. The structure is tortuous and unexpected, and the writing is vivid. Since the company launched the half-price joint sale of the above three books, buyers have been enthusiastic, and more than 2,000 copies have been sold. The sales locations are China Travel Service and its branches, Shanghai Bank, and major bookstores. The joint sale price is $2.15, and an additional $0.23 is charged for postage.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I have recently read a news item in your newspaper's local news column entitled "Labor Dispute at the Mei Hua Weaving Factory Resolved." There are discrepancies between the five points of the resolution and the settlement record signed by both parties at the time. For example, the second point, "Workers voluntarily withdraw bonuses," does not contain the word "temporarily" in the original text. Furthermore, other points are also not the original text at the time, and there are many omissions. It is truly perplexing as to why these errors occurred. In addition to awaiting notification from the Bureau of Social Affairs, we are sincerely concerned about confusing the public and therefore request a correction. Sincerely, Mei Hua Weaving Factory, September 28th.</p>

<p>Delayed Athlete Rosters from Various Locations</p>
<p>Compilation Group Rushes to Schedule Events</p>
<p>Excellent Location for Press Box</p>
<p>Tai Chi Exercises Busily Practiced in Districts</p>
<p>(Nanjing, September 28th) The National Games Compilation Group has been working overtime recently. However, as of yesterday, only 14 units had submitted athlete registration forms. The remaining provinces, such as Fujian, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Hunan, and units such as Beiping and Hong Kong, had not yet sent their registration forms due to postal delays, making it impossible for the Compilation Group to expedite the schedule of various competitions. To facilitate news reporters, the Organizing Committee has concentrated the finish lines of all events in the southeast corner of the field. The press box, originally on the right side of the east grandstand, has now been moved to the right corner of the west grandstand, directly facing the finish line. (Another dispatch) National Games News: (1) Athletes from the northwest provinces have been arriving in Beiping since the closing of the Northwest Games and will soon come to Nanjing.

<p>The National Games are scheduled to open in Nanjing on October 10th. Organizing Committee members Chu Minyi and Zhang Zhijiang specifically sent a letter to the Hangzhou Central Aviation School, requesting that aircraft be sent to participate in the opening ceremony of the Games. The original letter stated: "This year's National Games are scheduled to be held at the Central Stadium in the capital from Double Ten Day. We would like to request your school to send aircraft to participate in the opening ceremony of the Games at that time, to jointly celebrate the grand event. We hereby request that you review this matter and approve it." It is heard that the school has approved the request and will send aircraft to participate at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Zhang Zhijiang Writes to Chu Minyi Discussing National Martial Arts Tournament Issues <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang, Director of the Central Guoshu Institute, replied to Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, yesterday: "I have received your letter with instructions regarding the methods for the Guoshu examination and competition. Your sincerity and enthusiasm are evident in your writing. It is a valuable text for artistic research. I have carefully read and appreciated it deeply. The fist-fighting competition in the Guoshu examination is indeed what I advocate. However, the intention behind my advocacy may not have been fully understood by you. I will explain it again. The Guoshu examination and competition are indeed aimed at encouraging excellence, but in reality, they are not limited to this. The Chinese people have been weak for years and have been oppressed by autocratic power, resulting in a near-zero level of courage. This can be seen from the collapse of the Qing army in the late Qing Dynasty without even exchanging fire with foreigners. Now, the national crisis is urgent, and the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly tense. In the near future, our country will definitely need a national character that can charge into battle, go through fire and water. If this is not cultivated in advance, even if we have strong ships and powerful weapons, we will inevitably be overwhelmed by fear and make mistakes, affecting the entire situation with a single move. Moreover, the world has no perfect method, and timeliness is valuable. If, today, the government encourages and rewards Guoshu competitions from above, the trend will follow, and the fields will compete to strive forward, gradually cultivating the courage to be chivalrous, brave, and unafraid in the face of the enemy. This is not without benefit to the current needs of the national crisis. This is the first point. Your letter states that in equipment competitions, each type should be carefully compared before determining the ranking. In today's situation, this is an impractical argument. In Western duels, the choice of weapons is agreed upon beforehand. However, in our country, when suddenly encountering an enemy, it is impossible to know in advance or agree upon the type of equipment. What we rely on is our skill and ability to adapt to changes. If someone who practices with a knife can only fight against a knife, and someone who practices with a sword can only fight against a sword, what happens when they suddenly meet in a narrow alley without the same equipment? Should they resist or not? The matter of martial arts is slightly different from playing chess. If someone who is good at Go meets someone who is good at Xiangqi, they simply won't place a piece, and there will be no future disaster. However, if someone using a knife refuses to fight against someone using a sword, even if I withdraw, they will stab me in the chest. What should I do? Therefore, when testing a person's skills in the examination hall, special attention should be paid to situations where the equipment is different. The examination has rules and regulations, and the competition has detailed rules. Although the equipment may be different, the principles and methods must not be disturbed. However, this year's national examination is only the second session and is still in the preliminary guidance stage. For the sake of gradual progress, there will be no competitions with different types of equipment. In the future, more advanced methods will still involve competitions with different types of equipment, hoping to achieve practical results in application. This is the second point. Furthermore, those who practice Guoshu in the world today usually only learn the forms and neglect the research of actual self-defense, competition application, and performance. The performances are diverse, but in the face of the enemy, they abandon their armor and flee. They may not like the competition method. However, they do not know that in the past, when King Xuan of Qi listened to the Yu, if they played in a group, the musicians would muddle through. But if they listened one by one, the unskilled musicians would flee. The current competition is like listening to the Yu one by one. If they only learn performance, beginners can come on stage. If they also focus on competition, those with shallow knowledge will have difficulty getting lucky.甄拔眞才誠亦莫善於此也、至於閣下盧其失手致傷、已於比賽細則中嚴加限制、重承鼎囑、自當盡力籌策、加意防護、力求周備、况數全卽漲、斷不到拚命地步、上屆業有明騐、若滬杭之役、本自標明游藝性質、似又不可與國考相提并論也、總之弟以孤陋、不敢自以爲是、仍乞卓見指敎、并允擔任評判、在事實上共同研究將來改正之點、以策進於光明、如荷惠允、何幸如之云云、</p>
<p>Selecting truly talented people is indeed the best way. As for accidental injuries caused by Lu Qi, strict restrictions have already been imposed in the competition rules. I reiterate my commitment to do my best to plan, protect, and strive for thoroughness. Moreover, full participation will increase the odds, and there will be no need to risk one's life. The previous session has already provided clear evidence. The battles in Shanghai and Hangzhou were explicitly marked as recreational in nature and should not be compared with the national examination. In short, with my limited knowledge, I dare not be self-righteous. I still request your insightful guidance and permission to serve as a judge, to jointly study future areas for improvement in practice, to promote progress towards enlightenment. If I am granted this, how fortunate I would be."</p>
<h3 id="e190">Diary of the British Wimbledon World Tennis Tournament (10) (1) <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Special Correspondent from London 一志</p>
<p>Saturday, July 8th</p>
<p>Four finals were scheduled for today. By 7:30 PM, when the last mixed doubles final started on Centre Court, few spectators remained. The weather was still hot, with a hint of rain, but only a few drops fell. The first match, Mrs. Martell vs. Ms. Bride, was moved from 2:00 PM to 2:15 PM. The King and Queen of England arrived before the start of the match. Centre Court was packed, with people as numerous as grains of sand in a field.</p>
<p>Hopes were high beforehand that this English woman might win. However, probably none of the 15,000 spectators anticipated how close the match would be. Mrs. Martell won the first set 6-4 after each winning four games. Ms. Round won the second set 9-7. The situation after the completion of this set was, to put it mildly, pitiful and lamentable for both the players and the audience. After order was restored and the match continued, an extraordinary and unusual performance, never before seen, stunned the audience. Mrs. Martell used every kind of stroke to take the lead, winning the first set 6-3. Her foot injury was so severe that the match could barely continue in this set. At the beginning of the match, Ms. Round displayed her two fundamental strengths: first, her fluid strokes that kept the ball almost constantly in motion; second, using drop shots against Mrs. Martell, which, whether successful or not, proved to be a very effective strategy. Mrs. Martell was constantly running throughout most of the match, and towards the end, Mrs. Martell's strength to resist and defend decreased, and drop shots became less effective.</p>
<p>Each situation was like this: after Martell won the first set 6-4, the audience thought the second set would also be one-sided. Who knew that amazing things were just beginning? Martell served first and continued to win her serves, reaching 6-6. Both players were extremely exhausted. Ms. Round seemed to be in better spirits, and her strokes were more varied. Her forehand was powerful, her backhand reliable, and she was constantly ready to come to the net and try to put away the ball. Mrs. Martell stood at the baseline from beginning to end, hitting the ball with great care, and the placement was also very good, but with less power. Even before 6-6, her shots, and even her serves, gradually weakened. In the thirteenth game, she touched the net no less than four or five times, resulting in the failure of her serve. An unfortunate tragedy occurred in the next game. Round was down 30-40, and one of her groundstrokes landed three or four feet outside the line, but the linesman ignored it. Mrs. Martell looked at her in shock but immediately expressed her complete willingness to accept the ruling. At this time, the referee offered his opinion, saying that Mrs. Martell should win the point. It was said afterward that the referee thought the linesman had called it out. The linesman suddenly stood up from his chair and went to the referee, telling him that his ruling was irreversible. The discussion went on for some time, and the linesman on the service line also joined in. At the same time, Mrs. Martell retreated to the wooden panel behind the court, waiting with a look of panic and unease. Ms. Round was the same. It must be made clear that if Round's ball was called out, then Martell would win the game, making it 7-7. Finally, the referee declared that Round should win the point, and the score for this game became equal. Round served, and Martell made consecutive mistakes, so Round won this set 8-6.</p>
<p>The match never recovered from this point. Both players were in a state of panic. A drop shot from Round was not answered by Mrs. Martell. After both serving and returning, Martell only advanced a few feet inside the baseline, returning the ball very gently with a lob into Round's court. Sometimes she tried a drop shot and accidentally won. At 2-3, Round double-faulted, and the audience groaned. Martell then took a 4-2 lead but still didn't seem like a winner, as she seemed unable to move. Even balls within a few feet were abandoned. Once, she tried to answer a sideline ball, lost her footing, and fell to the ground. Then she served out again. Round then won this game. In the end, Ms. Round touched the net repeatedly, and Mrs. Martell finished 6-3. Martell's determination and ability to adapt were highly praised.</p>
<p>Borough's retention of the doubles championship with Buzzing was expected early on, but the process was quite laborious. In the last few games, they failed in several sets. Against Cooper and Farquharson, they were down two sets. But Borough quickly returned to his original state and regained balance, and Browning's overall performance was excellent, assisting him accordingly. Against Sato and Fujii, they lost the first set and then defeated them. In this setback, both Borough worked hard, and both sides performed brilliantly. Borough was the leader of the artillery, with balls hitting into the stands. Buzzing's defense was like a stone wall, but when necessary, he could also attack and often score points. On the other side, Sato and Fujii were more ferocious, and their ball placement was more skillful. However, their weakness was not guarding their position, which allowed the enemy to take advantage. Fujii was more active and aggressive, his shots were spectacular, but his serve was not yet satisfactory. After losing the second and third sets, this pair of Japanese players fought bravely, but ultimately could not save themselves and succumbed.</p>
<p>The women's doubles final was an enjoyable and interesting match. Ms. Ryan and Mrs. Matthew won. Ms. Ryan's name has appeared for the tenth time on this winner's list. Ms. James and Ms. York were completely ineffective against this fierce opponent, but in the second set, they fought hard and won 11-9. In the third set, they took a 3-1 lead, seeming hopeful. James's serve failed, and Ryan finally won the third set 6-4.</p>
<p>Ms. James has a talent for doubles. Her volleys and smashes were met with constant applause from the spectators. Ms. York, except for her serve, was not inferior to James in the slightest. Although she was slightly worse than her partner, she was also good at running and smashing. Both were extremely skillful, and it was a pleasure to watch. Their strategy was also similar to that of top-tier players. The main difference was that York was a natural frontcourt player, but the two exchanged positions very quickly. Ms. Ryan's shots were fierce and terrifying. Mrs. Matthew's groundstrokes from the backcourt were also powerful and fatal. Winning the mixed doubles championship at Wimbledon without losing a single set is a valuable achievement. Mrs. Cravinger and Crumb defeated Ms. Hyland and Farquharson, Mrs. Godfrey and Kingsley, Ms. Ryan and Mann, etc. The final against Hyland and Farquharson had been on the court for quite some time, a fierce battle of two sets, very long and lasting. Cravinger's stability and Crumb's versatility allowed them to return victorious. (End of full text)</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education Will Send a Large Number of Personnel to Inspect Local Education in Various Provinces and Cities Across the Country</p>
<p>To Make Preparations for Comprehensively Planning Educational Improvements Nationwide</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 28th) In order to understand the current state of local education in various provinces and cities across the country, the Ministry of Education will dispatch a large number of personnel, including department heads and counselors, to various provinces for on-site inspections. They will conduct separate investigations into areas such as administrative navigation education, higher education, and the implementation of education laws and regulations, in order to create detailed inspection reports, which will serve as a foundation for comprehensively planning educational improvements nationwide. It is reported that inspections in remote provinces will be postponed due to inconvenient transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Orders Expedited Completion of Matters That Should Have Been Handled Last Year <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued an order to the education bureaus of various counties, stating: It has been found that the 21st year of the Republic has long since ended. All educational matters promoted by the bureaus throughout the year, whether they are urgent and important, the completion of existing undertakings, the expansion of existing undertakings, or the advancement of emerging undertakings, are nothing more than administrative facilities, financial consolidation, and academic research, all of which are closely aligned with actual needs and must be implemented without delay. In order to close out the annual affairs, the department has specially conducted a review of the important matters that should have been handled by the bureaus in the 21st year. It has been found that some matters promulgated by the department have not been fully complied with, some matters approved by the counties have not yet been reported, and some matters with reporting deadlines have not been complied with at all. Such delays are highly inappropriate. Recently, it has become a common problem in administrative organs that lower levels treat orders from higher levels as mere formalities, perfunctorily fulfilling their responsibilities, and efficiency is not evident. Educational administrative organs have always valued scientific management. When implementing laws and regulations, they should be like the arm following the body's command and the finger following the arm's command, with seamless coordination from top to bottom and immediate results. It is not appropriate to feign compliance and violate orders, adopt this bad habit, or consider matters as having lost their timeliness due to inaction, and therefore shelve them. Matters that have already been handled, especially those with a continuous nature, should be inspected regularly and vigorously promoted to avoid the problem of procrastination over time. Therefore, a table of matters that must be expedited in the 21st year is specially prepared. Any bureau that has not handled or reported on a certain matter should be clearly noted in the table for easy viewing at a glance. In addition to separate orders, the aforementioned table is urgently dispatched, ordering the bureaus to conduct a review of the cases within five days of receiving the order, provide a written response on the reasons for not handling or reporting, as well as the dates for expediting the handling and reporting, and at the same time, complete and report for verification each of the items noted in the table, without further delay. This order is attached with a copy of the table of matters to be expedited in the 21st year. (Omitted)</p>

It has convened military training conferences several times to discuss methods and decided that each school in the provincial capital should be divided into city and island areas. The Pacification Commissioner's Office sent personnel to coordinate the training. All students were divided into three brigades, with the first brigade divided into four companies and the second and third brigades divided into three companies. It started on July 1st and ended on July 21st, a total of three weeks. Despite the sweltering heat, the students were diligent and achieved good results.</p>
<p>Summer School: This year's summer school was the fifth session held. The Provincial Department of Education focused on the in-service training of primary school teachers. Therefore, the lecturers hired were all domestic primary school experts. It started on July 17th and ended on August 16th, a total of four and a half weeks of classes, with 11 subjects taught for 186 hours, 6 public lectures, 4 lectures by famous people, and 7 discussion sessions. About 300 students from various counties attended, and all were able to persevere from beginning to end. The spirit of discussion was also very sincere.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Science Museum: In order to meet the needs of the environment, the Provincial Department of Education decided to establish a science museum, divided into four departments: physics, chemistry, biology, and geology. Tang Shouyi, the head of the third department, and others were assigned to be responsible for the preparations. Inspector Huang Kaisheng was sent to Shanghai to purchase teaching instruments and various specimens. Currently, the purchased items have been shipped to Fujian. The official opening is scheduled for October 10th.</p>

<p>Recently, a Polish correspondent translated information about Polish culture, which is specially introduced below:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding Literature and Art: From 1928 to 1932, within five years, 176 types of Polish literary masterpieces were translated into foreign languages. Czech was the first, followed by French, and Italian ranked third. Italy has recently shown particular interest in Polish literature. Next are Russian and Ukrainian. In these two countries, works about workers' lives and social issues are prevalent. Therefore, the Polish writers admired by Soviet Russia are Strug, Sienkiewicz, Kaden-Bandrowski, and Dąbrowska. The most respected Polish literary figure abroad is Sienkiewicz, who is Poland's greatest patriotic novelist, with 53 translations. Reymont has 44 translations, Sienkiewicz 12, and Orzeszkowa 11. According to recent statistics, Polish literature ranks second only to Russian literature in terms of Slavic literature translated into foreign languages.</p>
<p>The wife of Foreign Minister Beck initiated a Polish literary translation exhibition in Warsaw in October. Many beautifully bound books were sent from all corners of the globe. The exhibits were extremely rich.</p>
<p>The Kraków literary prize decided to select the best works that have developed national culture in the past three years and award prizes to encourage them.</p>
<p>"Hymn of the Sea," a grand and solemn ceremony was held beside the Rosviesham lighthouse. The entire nation of Poland paid tribute to renowned writer and poet Jan Kasprowicz, who praised the sea. Minister Szawarski gave a speech on behalf of the government, and after other speeches, he proposed renaming a navigational lighthouse the Jan Kasprowicz Lighthouse and erecting a temporary memorial plaque. General 理其椎塞 specially stated that the entire nation of Poland has a deep love for the sea, as Poland's outlet to the sea is related to the security of national defense. An international photo exhibition was held in Kraków last month with over 5,000 works. The United States and the Czech Republic had the most. An international woodcut exhibition was held in Warsaw this month, which attracted great attention abroad. England, France, Germany, the United States, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Spain, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Hungary, Sweden, Latvia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Japan all sent exhibits.</p>
<p>It was decided in November of this year to open a Polish art exhibition in Soviet Russia. The Polish government has appointed Janowski, the director of the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts, as a special commissioner to prepare for the exhibition and liaise with the Soviet Russian government in Moscow.</p>
<p>The Polish government has participated in the International Religious Art Exhibition held in Rome, displaying photos and charts of modern religious architectural trends. In addition to the government, Polish artists have also participated in a personal capacity.</p>
<p>A bust of Mussolini was sculpted by a Polish female sculptor, Mrs. Stelelicka, and is nearing completion. The Italian Prime Minister has posed for it several times. Mrs. Stelelicka has also created portraits of Princess Deby Mont and the Crown Prince's wife. This portrait of Mussolini will be placed on the航輪 "Ocean." This work has received very good reviews.</p>
<p>The 250th anniversary of the Polish King Sobieski III's defeat of Turkey in Vienna and the 70th anniversary of the 1863 anti-Russian revolution were commemorated by collecting designs to create new coins. The Postal and Telegraph Department also issued new commemorative stamps.</p>

<h3 id="e200">The Municipal Education Association Rectifies People's Schools <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Strictly Orders All Principals to Thoroughly Rectify</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Association yesterday issued an order to the people's schools, stating: This association has been running people's schools for several months, and various regulations have been formulated and issued one after another, ordering compliance. Recently, it has been found that students in various schools often have absences and dropouts, which goes against the association's original intention of running the schools and is highly inappropriate. In order to thoroughly rectify this, the association will send personnel to conduct secret investigations from time to time. If there are discrepancies in the number of students or other superficial situations, severe penalties will be imposed once discovered. In the future, the monthly funding will also be calculated based on the actual number of students attending classes. The principals of the schools are to comply with this order.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Various Universities in East China Prepare to Hold Second Speech and Debate Competition <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>School in Charge of Executive Affairs: National Central University</p>
<p>Local Prizes to be Collected by Fudan University</p>
<p>The speech and debate society, spontaneously organized by students from various universities in East China, held its first competition in Shanghai this past summer, with excellent results. The society not only serves as a platform for refining the art of speech and debate among the universities but also as a mechanism for fostering camaraderie. It is now understood that the National Central University will be the school in charge of executive affairs for the second competition. Chinese debates and English speeches, which will be held, are currently being planned. Each university will participate with one team (three members) in the debate, and two individuals in English speeches. The prizes for the local competition will be collected by Fudan University.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Cooperative Society Annual Meeting Postponed <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The China Cooperative Society's current (fourth) annual meeting was originally scheduled for mid-December in Nanjing, as decided by the society's executive committee at its third meeting. However, the society determined that the Xianzhou Memorial Cooperative Library, currently under construction in Nanjing, would soon be completed, and moving the society's headquarters to Nanjing and equipping the library would likely take a considerable amount of time. Preparations for the annual meeting would be insufficient; hence, the postponement was decided at the fourth meeting. However, the date has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Vocational Education Society to Hold Vocational Guidance Symposium Today <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The China Vocational Education Society, in response to the Ministry of Education's promulgation of measures for vocational guidance in secondary schools, believes it is urgent to convene authorities from various schools to conduct research to promote its effective implementation. Furthermore, given the worsening societal decline and the increasing difficulty for young people to find employment, a comprehensive plan is needed to address these issues. Therefore, the society's directors, Mr. Jiang Wenyu and Mr. Yang Weiyu, along with research director Dr. He Qingxu, have initiated the establishment of the Shanghai School Vocational Guidance Research Association. The association will convene in the society's conference room on the third floor at 3:00 PM today. In addition to organizational discussions, three proposals will be presented: (1) That all middle schools, both junior and senior levels, add vocational guidance courses during the final year or semester to assist students in further education and employment. (2) That all schools should regularly lead senior students to visit agricultural, industrial, and commercial institutions to increase their practical knowledge and foster social experience. (3) That all schools establish a student personality, academic ability, talent, and interest survey to be sent to the institutions of higher learning or employment that the students attend after graduation.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3 id="e204">Autumn's Combinations <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>No wonder the world laments autumn. Just look, the combinations that form the word "autumn" never have a good meaning. The old sage Cangjie already laid out the feng shui, so what's there to say!</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, let me give a few examples: Autumn on the heart is the "sorrowful" *chou*; autumn on the bird is the "oriole" *ying*, as in "the balding oriole cries" in history; the oriole is not a good bird. Autumn by the side of a person is the "ignore" *chou*, as in the *Romance of the Western Chamber*: "If he doesn't *chou* (acknowledge) people, what can one do?" *Chou* is not a welcome treatment. *Chou* is not a welcome treatment. Autumn by the side of the eye is the "glare" *chou* of "give him a *chou* (glare)"; *chou* is not a good look; autumn by the side of the hand is a "seize" *jiu*, like one grabs with their hand, autumn is not a good gesture; autumn by the side of metal is the "shovel" *qiao* used by corrupt officials to dig up the land, *qiao* is not a good tool; autumn by the side of the mouth is the "chirp" *jiu* of "the sky is gloomy and the ghosts cry *jiu jiu*," *jiu* is not a good sound; autumn by the side of water is the "narrow" *qiu* of a *qiu* place, *qiu* is not a good place. Autumn by the side of fish is a *qiao* (mud loach) in the mud, *qiao* is not a good fish. In conclusion, no matter how you combine it, you cannot find a word formed with the character "autumn" that is grand, rich, happy, or comfortable. No matter how you wear out every kind of dictionary, new or old, is there one? No, simply none.</p>
<p>If we were to say the line, "Another year has easily passed with the autumn wind," the seven characters already contain a kind of desolation. Change it to the word "spring," and "Another year has easily passed with the spring breeze," then there is the hope of "ten thousand things returning to spring," and one doesn't feel desolate at all. Therefore, national events don't necessarily happen in autumn; however, people always say, "the autumn of many events." National difficulties also don't necessarily happen in autumn; however, people always say, "the autumn of many difficulties." Try looking through various idioms to find a phrase "the summer of many difficulties" or "the summer of many events." Is there one? No, simply none!</p>
<p>Looking at it factually, national humiliation commemorations mostly occur in May, clearly the summer of many difficulties and the summer of many events; but with the extraordinary humiliation of September 18th, "the autumn of many events" and "the autumn of many difficulties" actually transformed from idioms into reality. How unfortunate is that!</p>
<p>The commemoration of September 18th has already passed ten days, but please, people, do not forget the autumn of many events and the autumn of many difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Gaochang Deity <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>Is this probably the Gaochang Deity on patrol?</p>
<p>Silence, make way! Banners reading "Silence," "Clear the Way," "Censorate," "Marquis of Yongning," "Gaochang Deity," etc., were carried on the shoulders of men in red, crossing the main road in a V-formation. Following them were fellow countrymen wearing embroidered silk sashes, high red hats, and each holding a square flag inlaid with the characters "Kitchen Quick." Behind them came two rows of gentlemen with red-topped hats and white silk shirts, Qiaoqi gauze jackets, holding copper incense burners. After that came the ten-section gong and drum team. Bringing up the rear, I heard, was the Gaochang Deity. These fellow countrymen walking in front of the Gaochang Deity must be the Deity's subordinates and guards making their appearance?</p>
<p>"The Master is coming, stop and clear the way!"</p>
<p>The Gaochang Deity, wearing a tall crown and court robes, sat in a frame carried by four people, looking quite majestic! Just as the divine palanquin was about to cross the road, a truck drove up from the left, and a tram filled with passengers came from the right. His incense-bearing disciples, fearing they would offend the divine might, shouted frantically, and the tram and the truck finally stopped.</p>
<p>Who exactly was the former incarnation of the Gaochang Deity? I am not a historian and have not consulted the Shanghai County Records (perhaps these records can be consulted). Offering a brick to attract jade, I can only await the clear instruction of researchers. But because the Gaochang Deity so pompously paraded through the streets, I couldn't help but think of two hapless deities in Jiangxi:</p>
<p>One is the famous alchemist and author of *Baopuzi* from the Jin dynasty, Ge Hong. On Mount Ge Xian (named after him) in Qianshan County, Jiangxi, there is a magnificent temple dedicated to him. Every year in August, people from seven or eight nearby counties come to the mountain to burn incense, numbering no less than tens of thousands. It is said that incense pilgrims who were not ritually clean would be punished by him until they were half-dead. However, recently, his temple was burned to the ground by so-called "rebels." The other is Li Deyu, who entered the position of Chancellor during the reign of Emperor Wu of Tang. He ascended to immortality on Mount Ling in Shangrao. Each year, people came to worship him in no fewer numbers than Ge Hong, and in years of drought, receiving this Old Immortal Li (his immortal title) was essential for rain. It is said that his temple was also burned down by the Communists the year before last.</p>
<p>Similarly, one is an immortal deity, but because they are located in different places, their experiences differ. Could it be that gods also have good and bad luck? The worthlessness of idol worship should be clear from this. Why are the civilized people of Shanghai so deluded?</p>
<h3 id="e206">Watching Dancing at a Dance Hall <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yingyue</p>
<p>On Saturday night, Miss Li, a "butterflies" (socialite) friend, took me to the dance hall where she goes every night to have fun. Although my heart trembled with a bit of inferiority and hesitation, my legs seemed eager to explore, and I followed her to our destination.</p>
<p>The surroundings of the dance hall were very quiet, without any of the noisy city air. Colored glass tubes reflected from the yellow mud-like short walls, tinting my white shirt a light purple. Across the street, there were a dozen newly painted cars parked. At the entrance, some small boys in copper buttoned white canvas uniforms and a security guard were joking.</p>
<p>Stepping through the gate, there was a garden with green grass and trees, and the scenery was particularly pleasant under the cloak of night. From the entrance, a path led directly to the dance hall, and the surroundings of the dance hall were all made of agate, crystal clear, which made people reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>Inside the dance hall sat many beautiful girls, curly hair, black eyebrows, red lips, high breasts, jade-colored arms, soft legs, filled the air with temptation, seven or eight youths with numb nerves, their dark eyes searching like sea-exploring lights.</p>
<p>The melodious music began, and the whole hall was filled only with a lush, intoxicating green light. The men and women also left their seats one after another, he and she, she and she, pairs of them embracing tightly, rotating back and forth in the middle according to the rhythm of the music! Rotating! Rotating!</p>
<p>Their spirits were indeed a little excited, but this excitement contained a deep sense of boredom! Time flew by moment by moment, and they kept embracing each other again and again, like puppets without any human emotion.</p>
<p>"A paradise on earth!" Feeling a little tired, I escaped from this enjoyment den of gigolos like Algiers, sighing softly.</p>
<p>The cool breeze of nature swept away the artificial scent I had picked up, and it was already eleven o'clock when I walked home alone.</p>
<h3 id="e207">The Northeast Fourth Company Commander <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Bitter Feelings Still Bring Blessings, Hurried Military Affairs Secretly Shift the Troops</p>
<p>Gui Zhi told me that for the sake of her livelihood, she dared not offend her brother, believing me to be a money-grabbing person. But as for herself, she could abandon a friend in need and marry the current company commander. A company commander is just a junior officer at best, so what's so great about that? Thinking of this, she couldn't help but clench her fist and slam it on the table. The waiter was carrying a cup of coffee in both hands, about to place it on the table, when he heard the thud, splashing the water in the cup all over the saucer. He shrank back and stared blankly at Ji Zhi. Ji Zhi herself immediately realized what had happened. She smiled and said, "You haven't been open for a year, so why is this table so unsteady?" The waiter then realized that she was actually adjusting the table for him, and he had misunderstood. So, with a smile, he placed the coffee cup on the table, but his eyes still kept glancing at her. Ji Zhi saw that the sugar cube jar was in the middle of the table, so she used the copper tongs to put a sugar cube in the cup, and then another sugar cube, her eyes shooting beyond the sugar jar. Her whole body was numb, not knowing what she was doing. Suddenly, she looked down and saw that the sugar cubes in the coffee cup were already sticking out of the water. How sweet should the coffee be with all this sugar in it? So, seeing that no one was around, she picked the sugar cubes out of the cup. Her original intention was to take them out and put them in the saucer under the cup. But her eyes were fixed on a snack price list on the opposite wall. By the time she finished reading the price list, things were even worse. She had scooped up all the sugary water, including the sediment, into a plate of egg cakes. This was really terrible. If the waiter saw it, wouldn't he think she had gone crazy? She turned around and saw that the waiter wasn't there. Then, unexpectedly, she dumped the plate of egg cakes into the spittoon. As soon as she finished dumping, the waiter came. (200)</p>
<h3 id="e208">Shattered Youth <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>A delicate and beautiful flower, when it is budding and in full bloom, fragrant and rich, is most likely to attract the attention of wandering butterflies and bees. But, unable to withstand the rain and wind, the flower will wither and fall. At this time, the bees and butterflies have already flown to other branches and will no longer come to pay their respects or feel sorry.</p>
<p>A beautiful and good woman, in the prime of her youth, is just like a fresh flower. But her pure will, unable to withstand the pursuit of the opposite sex and the temptation of vanity, is most likely to go astray. Once her beauty fades and her reputation is tarnished, it is like a flower that has gone through wind and rain, and the past is like a dream, unbearable to look back on!</p>
<p>Today's modern women, before tasting that kind of bitterness, are reveling in revelry with the opposite sex, like being drunk, talking about love, and enjoying the scenery to the fullest. How do they know that good dreams don't last long? When the other party's purpose is achieved, they are abandoned like leftovers and not worth a second glance. At this time, even if she is sad and painful, it is too late to regret.</p>
<p>The new film "Remnant Spring" by the Star Film Company, which will be released at the New Light Theater on October 1st, can be used as a mirror for today's modern women. Jin Meili (played by Ms. Xu Lai, the standard beauty of the East) in the play is a completely modern girl, but her result is taking poison and sacrificing herself.</p>
<p>Modern girls must remember that youth is the easiest to waste. Quickly turn the time spent on enjoyment and talking about love to striving for social causes! Wasting youth will only make you like fallen flowers and flowing water, unrecoverable. Jin Meili in "Remnant Spring" is the best lesson.</p>
<p>Correction: In the previously published article by Mr. Tu Jiangxia, "China is Full of Gold," it was stated that the Italian priest Matteo Ricci came to China to preach and wrote "Oriental Journey" after returning to his country. Ricci was actually a mistake for Polo. Yesterday, Mr. Zhan Ru of Jiangwan explained everything in detail. This is to correct the error and thank Mr. Zhan Ru.</p>

<h3 id="e209">General Mobilization of Laughter <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>A smile, less a sorrow; laughter is something that stimulates the appetite and is good for the spirit, beneficial to people. However, inducing laughter is also a difficult thing. First, the vulgar and rude words like those in the bars, and the general inappropriateness like a bedpan as a hat or a pot (pottery) of wine in shadow plays, are not for the upper class. Then there's another kind, where you think it's extremely funny, but before the words are even out of your mouth, you burst into loud laughter yourself. In this breathless narration, no matter how well you speak, it will only make people listen with a forced smile, putting on a Laurel-like awkward face. Therefore, to induce laughter, the first thing is to have a Buster Keaton-like deadpan face, and then, with that deadpan face, tell a joke.</p>
<p>The Turtle Who Studied the *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* Thoroughly</p>
<p>At a banquet, a friend who liked to talk a lot was telling wild stories. He told a story about a storyteller who ridiculed a storyteller who told longer stories. On the day of the birthday of Zhang Tianjun, the Great Emperor of the North Pole, he ordered his turtle and snake generals to say that any immortals who came to offer birthday wishes and violated the precepts of wine, lust, wealth, and anger would be turned away. The two generals obeyed the Great Emperor's command and guarded the mountain gate. Before long, an immortal came riding on a cloud. The snake general, seeing that it was Lü Dongbin, hurried forward to stop him and recited the Heavenly Decree. Lü Xian asked how he had violated the four precepts. The snake general replied, "You were drunk three times in Yueyang Tower, violating the wine precept; you teased Bai Mudan three times, violating the lust precept; you turned stones into gold and cut down the Yellow Dragon with your sword, violating the wealth and anger precepts. You have violated all four precepts, how can you offer birthday wishes?" Lü Xian, hearing this, left indignantly. After a while, Guan Yu came riding on Red Hare, holding his Green Dragon Crescent Blade. The turtle general, seeing this, hurried forward to stop him and recited the Great Emperor's edict to Guan Yu. Guan Yu, hearing this, stroked his long beard and asked the turtle general to state the precepts he had violated. The turtle general also spoke eloquently, "A large banquet every ten days, a small banquet every five days, violating the wine precept; a tael of gold to mount the horse, a tael of silver to dismount, violating the wealth precept; slaying Diaochan under the moon, slaying six generals at five passes, violating the wealth and lust precepts." Guan Gong, not waiting for him to finish, raised his silkworm eyebrows, widened his phoenix eyes, held his big knife, and shouted angrily, "You turtle, you speak the *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* so thoroughly!" When Mr. So-and-so said this, he even acted out the gestures, quite pleased with himself. A humorist, hearing this, suddenly asked Mr. So-and-so to repeat Guan Yu's words. Mr. So-and-so said loudly again, "You turtle, you speak the *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* so thoroughly!" But the sound of laughter suddenly erupted from the whole gathering, but Mr. So-and-so was still complacent.</p>

<p>A certain teacher, while lecturing on history, when discussing the well-field system, said eloquently that the well-field system was to dig a well in the center of each field, so that in drought years, water could be drawn from the well to irrigate the fields, so as not to be like digging a well when one is thirsty, impossible to salvage. A certain student, hearing this, stood up and said, "According to what the teacher said, if the well-field is explained this way, then the two words 'warfare' in the book must mean that each soldier eats a knife, and if the soldiers are all killed, no wonder the world will be in great chaos." The professor, hearing this, was stunned and did not know how to answer.</p>
<h3 id="e211">How Would They Know I Am a Patriotic Youth? <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>There was a patriotic youth in Suzhou who, after the January 28th Truce Agreement, had resolved to go north and go beyond the borders to resist Japan. At the same time, he sent out many letters to inform his friends of his determination to resist Japan. But several days after the farewell banquet, he was still lingering with his sisters and had not yet set off. So, a group of friends who had given him the farewell banquet asked him when he would depart. The youth, hearing this, said with a look of grief and trepidation, "I have been preparing to leave for a long time, but I can't bear to leave the women here." The friends, hearing this, all said, "Aren't there women over there too? You can go after them as much as you like!" The youth's attitude became even more distressed, and he said sadly, "But how would the women over there know that I am a patriotic youth!"</p>
<h3 id="e212">A Cigarette Factory Opened in His Pocket <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>A stingy friend, his cigarettes mostly came from friends, never buying them with his own money. One day, he bummed another cigarette from a friend. After taking a few puffs, he couldn't smoke anymore because he had other things to do. But how could he willingly sacrifice that long cigarette butt? So, he put out the fire on the edge of the table and hid it in the inner pocket of his clothes where he always stored cigarettes. Who knew that the embers of the cigarette butt were not completely extinguished and actually caught fire again, and the two cigarette butts already in his pocket, along with it, emitted wisps of white smoke. By the time that friend realized it, sparks were already flying straight up, and it was impossible to salvage. After finally putting it out, his pocket was already burned through and his clothes were torn. A joker, seeing his comical face, teased him, "A cigarette factory has opened in your pocket, so you don't have to ask people for cigarettes anymore!" Amidst the laughter of others, that friend's face became even more comical.</p>

<p>U.S. Expands Credit Lending</p>
<p>Gold Price Returns to Small After Rising</p>

<p>The gold market rose and fell yesterday, with the future market becoming even weaker.

The initial opening rose to 93.4 yuan, but there was selling pressure from Yifeng, Yongfu, Yu Yuan, Sheng Yong, and Xianyou, causing a decline. Although the opening was initially stable, bank appetite decreased, and it retreated to within 90 yuan. Confidence waned, and as dealers sought to cover their positions, the banks' appetite was not strong, resulting in a consistently weak and declining trend. Finally, the foreign exchange market loosened significantly, and Reuters reported that President Roosevelt was confident that the recovery movement would succeed and that credit lending would be expanded to replace direct currency inflation. The price further fell at noon, and the afternoon market opened flat. After fluctuating, it eventually broke the 80 yuan barrier. Western merchants were heavily shorting, and confidence was unstable. As the foreign exchange market experienced both buying and covering at low prices, the gold market fluctuated around 80 yuan, eventually closing below 80 yuan. The clam shell price was 1110 yuan.

A technical rebound may occur soon. The daily trading volume was 2,310,000 shares. The wheat market showed a very strong recovery ability. Although the selling pressure was strong throughout the day, many people bought at low prices at the close, causing the price to rebound. The closing market was very firm, with continued optimism. The cotton market was calm, with a tendency to wait for the definite development of currency policy. There was little hedging in the South, sales were good, and the foundation was solid. The silver market was unstable and weak at the close. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 93.18 Down 4.23</p>

<p>The yarn market is becoming firmer, with a slight upward trend. One factory is actively buying, with approximately 6,000 bales, and there are rumors in the market that the 30,000+ bales of inventory in yarn warehouses will be cleared in the three months of October, November, and December on a periodic basis. As a result, the news spread, and some active buying occurred to go long. However, sellers still believe that the overall trend is unfavorable and have no intention of hedging. The fundamental issue is still considering actual demand.</p>
<p>Good Yuan Price Rises. The previous market opened with good news and a lack of sellers, and prices for each month rose by 0.4-0.5 to 0.7 yuan. In the afternoon, after hearing that current yarn sales were improving, the market sentiment remained tight, and prices for each month rose another 0.3-0.4 yuan.

<p>The cotton market softened, and a downward trend resumed. With U.S. cotton flat and the weather turning sunny, and the U.S. cotton purchased by the National Government arriving in Shanghai soon, confidence weakened further. However, buyers continued to buy and add positions, with no intention of releasing them. As arrivals from various regions were not yet active, factory purchases were still good. In short, there are too many chips traded by both long and short parties, so market fluctuations are particularly intense.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Prices Drop 0.3-0.4 Yuan. The Zheng Biao market opened weaker in the morning, due to good weather and flat foreign cotton, with a lack of buyers in the market. Prices for each month fell by 0.25 yuan. The situation remained weak in the afternoon, with prices for each month falling another 0.1-0.2 yuan.

As a result, spot prices fell by 0.05 pounds, and futures prices fell by 0.05 to 0.11 pounds. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by 0.06 points, and near-term futures were firm by 0.02 points and long-term futures were weak by 0.01 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 0.01 points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to short covering and buying by a few speculators. As a result, Pingal, Omar, and Ruaj all rose by 2 rupees, and White Creek rose by 1.75 rupees.

<h3 id="e223">Influx of New Grain, Rice Prices Plunge <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, after a long period of rain, the weather cleared and nearly 60 boats arrived in succession, further softening confidence. Local store customers were also watching before the festival, and sales were particularly sluggish for out-of-town buyers. Prices for all goods plunged, with new goods, which accounted for two-thirds of the arrivals, being particularly affected. Changbang, Su Tongbang, and broke-grain Chenjian rice fell by 0.2 yuan. Nanhang thick rice, due to the large number of arrivals, was discounted by about 0.4 yuan. Qingjiao, Song Si thin rice, and new tip rice prices were more active, and the market was slightly tighter, with 1,300-1,400 bags traded. Prices were reduced by 0.1 yuan. The rest of the new rice prices fell by 0.3-0.4 yuan. Yin Yuan goods were scarce and remained stable. Yuan rice was still unavailable.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: Over 50 boats arrived from various regions, and sales of all goods were sluggish. Broken grain, Dingxi new grain, thin rice, Xinbu Dujian, prices down slightly by 0.1 yuan. Medium grade Xi Xin Geng, Dong Xin Geng, Ling Bai Jian, Tuan Jian, prices reduced by 0.1-0.2 yuan. New and old Yang Jian, Chen Dujian, Bai Yuan and other prices fluctuated slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Ke Hsien Rice Arrivals Gradually Increase <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Ke Hsien rice saw a surge in arrivals yesterday. The market price had soared by 0.5-0.6 yuan a week prior, and prices had been rising steadily until the day before yesterday, when they began to return to normal. During this upward period, traders were quite active. Goods from Nanjing and its vicinity had been arriving repeatedly, and Shanghai warehouses had stores. As for Hunan goods, which require a six-to-seven-day journey, shipments only began arriving in port the day before yesterday. Yesterday, 16,500 bags of new rice arrived, and samples were already being sent out. The Minbang (Fujian) were the most eager buyers, and the Ao Province (Macau) and Shantou were more active. The provincial capital gang in Shantou had sent people to Changsha to contact the joint government-merchant production and sales committee in that area, seeking direct transport to reduce intermediate losses. The Chaozhou gang focused on Wuhu rice, which they had been purchasing in Wuhu for years, and were particularly eager to buy recently. Therefore, sales in Shanghai did not see activity from the Guangzhou and Chaozhou gangs. The Shantou gang focused on applying for loading in Shanghai, and were interested in Xiang rice and Jing rice. Yesterday, they applied to load 1,985 bags of Xiang Province coarse rice at prices of 5.9-5.5 yuan, and 1,500 bags of Jingji Hsien rice at prices of 7-6.5 yuan. 187 bags of Jiangxi late Ji were purchased by the gang at a price of 7.85 yuan. Also, 700 bags of Yang Jian were priced at 7.6-7.45 yuan. The arrival of rice was strong yesterday, and the price of each grade fell by a few cents.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Factories Replenish This Month's Flour <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, the prices of each month showed a trend of first weakening and then stabilizing. With foreign wheat quotes, Chicago was up about 0.4 yuan and Canada was down 0.4 yuan, so at the initial opening, the market sentiment was still average. The opening price for this month was only 0.175 yuan, and the distant term also showed a soft trend. Later, because the delivery of this month was approaching, factories all replenished their positions, while the number of orders for the distant term was not large, so the market sentiment inevitably stabilized. When the market opened in the afternoon, this month was still replenished by the factories, and it was rumored that the Tianjin gang had opened six or seven hundred thousand bags in gun carriages, with a Tianjin delivery price of 2.27 yuan. It was also heard that Maigen had withdrawn, and the price was only 0.2 yuan. Outside the industry, the market sentiment was eager to rally. However, the inventory of each factory was very large, and this situation may still be temporary. As a result, this month was up 0.0125 yuan, October was up 0.015 yuan, November was up 0.0175 yuan, December was up 0.015 yuan, January was up 0.0125 yuan, and February was up 0.015 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e226">A Small Rebound in Wheat Futures <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>After the wheat futures market opened yesterday morning and afternoon, the prices of each month showed an initial flat and then stable trend. With foreign wheat quotes, Chicago and Canada had mutual fluctuations of 0.4 yuan, so at the time of opening, they were slightly weak. Later, because the number of sellers was very low, the market sentiment was inevitably sustained. However, the trading volume for each month then became cold and lifeless. The foreign firm was selling foreign wheat, and it was heard that yesterday's price was 4.63 yuan. The future situation can be deeply explored. As a result, October and December were up 0.02 yuan, and was up 0.03 yuan. The current wheat market is generally settled, and factory demand is also tending to stop. It was heard that Dongtai wheat was 3.82 yuan, Zhentong wheat was 3.83 yuan, and Yangzhou wheat was 3.73 yuan, and 1,300 bags were opened and purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e227">In the Sugar Market, This Factory's Fine White Sugar Returns Down 0.05 Yuan <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was expected to rise as both customs gold and standard gold rose. However, as the Mid-Autumn Festival approached, sales decreased, so the association cut the price of 24 coarse sand white sugar to 21.8 yuan at the original price. There were no transactions for 20 medium sand white sugar and Dutch red. Taikoo sugar was down 0.05 yuan, B mark was 21.7 yuan, and OW mark was 21.55 yuan. Fine white sugar from the China, Guohua, and Zhenji factories was also down 0.05 yuan each, with No. 1 at 20.7 yuan, No. 2 at 0.5 yuan, No. 3 at 0.3 yuan, and No. 4 at 0.1 yuan. Zhenji No. 5 was 19.9 yuan, and China top number was 20.9 yuan. Only dozens of bags of Gao Longgang Qing sugar were opened for Chaoshan at 14.95 yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, the price of Xiang lotus seeds has slightly decreased due to lower land costs. According to a dispatch from Hankou, the current purchase price is around twenty taels per dan. In the Shanghai market, Xiangtan lotus seeds are priced at fifty-three or fifty-four yuan, with subsequent prices ranging from fifty-one yuan to forty-five or forty-six yuan, a drop of five or six yuan compared to mid-month. The trend has not yet stabilized.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Silk and Tea: High-Grade Zhuang Zhenmei Tea Sells Well at Firm Prices <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local tea market, British firms such as Xiehe, Jinlong, and Tongfu actively purchased high-grade Zhuang Zhenmei green tea from Tunxi and Wuyuan. The incoming goods were quickly sold out. Among them, famous Tun Zhuang teas were quoted at two hundred and five yuan for extracted center teas and one hundred and forty yuan for standard Zhenmei. Wuyuan Zhuang standard Zhenmei was quoted at one hundred and thirty-five yuan. Market prices were quite firm. However, high-grade Zhuang teas were exceptionally scarce in the market, and low-grade teas often did not meet sales expectations, resulting in sluggish trading. Similarly, Gongxi Needle-like teas also mirrored the Zhenmei tea situation, showing a trend of rising high-grade and suppressing low-grade teas.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Oil Market: Soybean Oil Suffers a Sharp Decline After a Half-Month of Resistance <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>The soybean oil market suffered from a decline in buying power due to continuous telegrams and lower production prices. Efforts to resist this decline have lasted for half a month. However, selling pressure is now unavoidable. As a result, yesterday, the market opened prices for various soybean oils, but there were significant differences compared to prices from two weeks prior. Ship-borne Dalian oil prices were only reduced by forty-five cents due to limited supply. Ship-borne Qishan oil fell by seventy cents, while Niuzhuang oil stocks surged, resulting in a sharp decline. Ship-borne cargo fell by eighty cents, and wheel-transported cargo fell by ninety cents. (See the market price column for prices and transaction volumes.)</p>

<h3 id="e231">"Eating Religion" <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Fengzhi</p>
<p>Mr. Da Yi, in "The Dream of Literary Domination," criticizes Liu Xie for "shaming the sages" because Liu Xie claimed to have begun writing after dreaming of Confucius, but later became a monk. In fact, since the Northern and Southern Dynasties, Chinese literati and scholars, Daoists and monks, have generally been characterized by a "lack of special dedication." Famous figures since the Jin Dynasty each had three little hobbies: first, the "Analects" and the "Classic of Filial Piety"; second, "Laozi"; and third, the "Vimalakirti Sutra." They not only used these as talking points but also often wrote commentaries. During the Tang Dynasty, there were debates between the three religions, which later turned into everyone mocking each other. It was not a big deal for so-called famous Confucians to write a few inscriptions for Buddhist temples. Song Dynasty Confucians looked solemn but secretly appropriated Chan Buddhist sayings. In the Qing Dynasty, not long ago, we still knew that Confucian scholars believed in the "Book of Great Inducement" and the "Yin Zhi Wen of Emperor Wenchang," and would even invite monks to their homes to perform repentance rituals.</p>
<p>When Christianity was introduced to China, Christians considered themselves believers, but ordinary people outside the religion called them "eaters of religion." These two words truly captured the "spirit" of the believers, and could also encompass most believers in Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism, as well as be applied to many old heroes who "eat the revolutionary rice."</p>
<p>People in the Qing Dynasty called the eight-legged essay a "knocking brick," because once you obtained fame and status, it was like opening a door, and the brick was no longer needed. In recent years, there have been so-called arguments in magazines. The emergence of "XX Review" was not due to oppression but because the authors of this group were soaring. The decline of "New Moon" was because the old members had all "climbed" up, and were far away from the moon. To distinguish this kind of thing from the "knocking brick," we should call it a "ladder to heaven."</p>
<p>"Religion" in China has always been like this. Talking about revolution is one thing; talking about loyalty and filial piety is another; circling with the Grand Lama is another; building pagodas and hiding doctrines is another. In an era suitable for exclusive "eating," the focus should be on one supreme authority. In an era suitable for "eating" together, the various religions are not fundamentally different, except that one dish is a whole duck, and the other is a mixed assortment. Liu Xie was the same, merely changing from "not sprinkling ginger" to eating vegetarian food. There was no difference in the amount in the stomach. Moreover, for a monk to annotate the "Analects," the "Classic of Filial Piety," or "Laozi" is still a kind of "heavenly principle," isn't it?</p>
<h3 id="e232">The Beginning of Opium Import into China <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Zhan</p>
<p>In my "Qulu's Mutterings" article on the people of Sichuan and opium, I cited the poem of Yong Tao, a Shu person of the late Tang Dynasty, as evidence, stating that opium already existed in China as early as the Li Tang Dynasty. Recently, in the twelfth volume, eighth book of the Complete Tang Poems, I saw Li Zhenbai's poem praising poppy seeds:</p>
<p>Inverted arrangement of Shuanglu pieces, sparsely inserted jasper ivory counters.</p>
<p>Resembles both sacrificial cow milk and a bag of jingling horse bells.</p>
<p>Drumsticks and waterfall arrows have their origin.</p>
<p>I say that the Chinese already grew opium in the Tang Dynasty, this is also evidence. Wu Yu's "History of the Opium War" says that the Sino-foreign opium trade had been going on for many years before the Opium War. It states that poppy seeds were imported by Arab merchants as early as the Zhenyuan period of the Tang Dynasty. Xiao Yishan's "Comprehensive History of the Qing Dynasty" and Chen Huai's "Outline of Qing History" hold the same view, but I do not know on what basis. The "Old Book of Tang, Biography of the Western Regions" states that the country of Fulin sent envoys in the second year of Qianfeng to present "diyejia," and some suspect that "diyejia" is the poppy, but it is also unknown whether this is true. The Qing Confucian Yu Zhengxie's "Gui Yi Lei Gao" quotes the Tang translation of the "Vinaya Miscellaneous Matters Sutra," stating that the sick inhale smoke through two bowls joined together with a hole in the bottom, fire in the middle to burn the medicine, and a twelve-finger-long iron pipe placed in the hole to inhale it. However, it is not known whether Indian opium entered China together with the Buddhist scriptures at that time. The opium that first anesthetized our spiritual values then that same opium anesthetized the flesh. The red-headed ××'s poison is in China; how could it merely be foreign port big capitalists, those who work with the tiger, be accomplices!</p>
<h3 id="e233">Reading "Diary of a Madman" <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>While sorting through old books, I accidentally came across a copy of "A Call to Arms" that I bought eight years ago.</p>
<p>The blood-red cover, although somewhat dimmed, its spirit seems indestructible. Opening it, each and every word is still like being carved on wood.</p>
<p>The nostalgia was awakened. Unconsciously, I picked up the book and continued reading. I wanted to see if the current era has some similarities with the era depicted in the book. In other words, whether the environment in "A Call to Arms" has passed.</p>
<p>The first piece is "Diary of a Madman."</p>
<p>The madman in "Diary of a Madman" suspects that everyone around him wants to eat him, and he draws various pieces of evidence from all directions to prove that they are all cannibals. He cannot even feel safe with the dog of the Zhao family giving him a glance. Eight years ago, when I first read this piece, I only found the madman in the book ridiculously and pitifully neurotic. But now, I cannot laugh. I can only fix my serious gaze on the book.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the era has dragged me into the book, making me similar to the madman in "Diary of a Madman." I still remember very clearly how the era persecuted me the year after "A Call to Arms" came into my hands. Around me, whether in my family or in society, everywhere was filled with people who wanted to eat me, with eyes that wanted to eat me. At that time, I also burned my beloved books with tears in my eyes, and I also fled outside and lived a life of exile with tears in my eyes. I was really afraid even when a dog glanced at me. Luckily, my birth chart was good, and I was able to leak out from the teeth of these cannibals. But looking back at other young people who "were born at the wrong time" and were eaten by cannibals, not even leaving their bones behind, I cannot help but be frightened and gasp.</p>
<p>Even now, although I am living a different kind of life, I still feel surrounded by cannibals. Occasionally going out, getting on a tram or a bus, I carefully look around, and everyone has a fierce look on their faces, staring intently, as if they cannot wait to swallow me whole, causing my heart to beat wildly.</p>
<p>Even in the literary world that I respect, it now seems that a corner has been occupied by cannibals. Some of them will openly sell their friends, some will fabricate rumors under pseudonyms, and insidiously slander, all wanting to eat the flesh and blood of others to expand their own Western-style houses. This makes me, who had the ambition to be a small soldier in the cultural movement eight years ago, shrink back.</p>
<p>"When will the era of 'Diary of a Madman' finally pass?" Looking at the gloomy sky outside the window, I cannot help but sigh.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Travel Notes <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Tianma</p>
<p>5. Jiang Recievers and Callers</p>
<p>In this trip, two kinds of people are most admired and fearful of me, that is Jiang Receivers and Callers. For these two kinds of people, consistently, I abide by the lessons of the second gentleman Confucius to respect the gods and stay away from them.</p>
<p>"Jiang Recievers" are hotel's special envoy to the ship to pick up guests-no, solicit business, and callers, everyone knows that is the peddler selling snacks or local specialties. These two kinds of people have the diplomat-like words, warrior-like courage, fox-like cunning, monkey-like agility, and also like brown sugar with a soft劲, no matter who, as long as they are valued, they will spend a lot of effort to get rid of.</p>
<p>Whenever the ship is approaching the pier, far away, you can see the group of heroes, like preparing for a hundred-yard race, everyone energetic waiting on the pier. As soon as the ship docks, a shout and the soldiers rushed to the front of the enemy, desperately squeezed on the ship, desperately run up. That situation is really like "mercury leaks into the ground, not permeable. Then it is "Fortune Hotel", "Yangtze River Restaurant", "Eggs", "New peanuts," trying to scream as if deliberately competing for who has the loudest voice, who is strong enough, so the ship will immediately be crowded and noisy into a mess.</p>
<p>If at this time your door is not closed, and you also want to see the comedy outside the door, immediately, the heroes will come to you, first a kindly smiling face, and then softly said: "Sir, are you here again? Still live with us, OK? Prices are fair, hospitality is thoughtful, sir is also an old customer,..." This will really make you flattered, and can not answer. Whether you have been to this port, he always asserts that you are their old customer, whether you go ashore, he always advises you to fall into their inn, so, easily, one goes, and one comes, the words are this set, and people do their best. At this time, although you will feel trouble, but you will never sincerely admire their talent.</p>
<p>After Jiang Reciever leaves, the caller will then come, also first a smiling face, then sing all his goods' nicknames, and then take one by one to your eyes. For example, it is selling Wuhu dried bean curd, he will say: "Look, this dried curd is so good. Also fragrant, also tender, take some back, both good for yourself to eat, but also good for sending people, on the turn Sir not bought a hundred or two? Old customer, this time buy some more!" By analogy to sell Nanjing salted duck or sell Jiujiang porcelain, the words are always this set, especially everyone will definitely recognize that you are his old customer, last time you bought a lot, this time there is a re-buy "obligation". So, also one left, another came, no matter you shake your head, you refuse out loud, even scold him to get out, he is still that kind and good-natured, still that kind of sincerely advise you, until you accept his advice, or you slap the door shut with force.</p>
<p>For these two heroes, I never dared to ask for advice, the ship was about to approach the pier, I had already closed the door, only dared to peek in the window, so the heroes also seem to have "hope and not be able to reach" indignation!</p>
<p>I thought, when the September 18th Incident broke out the year before last, if we had sent these two kinds of talents to Geneva to appeal for rescue, the great powers would probably not have stood by as they do today!</p>
<h3 id="e235">In a Third-Class Carriage (Continued) <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Jin</p>
<p>The train left Pukou in the drizzling rain. It was eleven o'clock. I did not leave my footprints in Nanjing, and I regret it. I have several friends in Nanjing. I should have gone to see them. I should have set aside some time to spend with them, but the rain stopped me. What I especially miss is that friend who is suffering from a disease and his wife. He recently wrote to me saying: "Your pure and great spirit, your unrestrained and relaxed life, whenever I have a moment of calmness, I think of you: I am gradually buried deeper and deeper and become a mud man. I often hope to end my life early because I have a chronic illness." Last year, in Beiping, I received his hospitality for more than a week. I spent those nights with him in the same bed, listened to his coughs and mutterings many times. I left a pair of stone balls that I bought in the Summer Palace in that small apartment and left. The impression he left on me has not faded to this day, it is still as vivid as last year: pure and great spirit, only he can receive this evaluation. But no one has ever understood him. Now he is weakening day by day in the struggle of a difficult life, under the contemptuous eyes of society. Every time I read his prose mixed with blood and tears, my whole soul is disturbed. I often shout madly in my heart: He cannot die, he should live on, become strong, and enjoy the happiness in life.</p>
<p>My thoughts turned like wheels. But the rain gradually lessened. At one stop, the rain stopped completely. The weather was still bad. The pressure on my heart has not eased either. But the train is moving forward again, like a roaring, hungry beast.</p>
<p>There were not many passengers in the carriage. Many seats were empty. One person could occupy a chair. The carriage was new. The color of the paint was bright, and it was washed very clean. There were blinds. These made an old guest on the opposite side exclaim in surprise from time to time.</p>
<p>The weather later improved. The sun peeked out from the clouds. Outside the train window were trees, fields, and mountains, but I remembered every moment that I was going north.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e236">Passionate Children (2) <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Ge Mang and Sai Zuoying</p>
<p>And this crisp, beautiful sound, even when saying the most trivial things, contains a kind of flattery: "Godfather, would you like to move your chair to the porch?" She talks about Paris, she talks about the exhibition and the white palaces towering on the banks of the Seine. If you can go to this place to play, it must be very happy thing, so he dreams of that magnificent and incredible magical city. He hopes to go there with her.</p>
<p>"But if this makes you happy, good boy, you come after lunch on Sunday. White Duck only has four days to play with us; we can take a car to the green forest for a ride."</p>
<p>× × × × ×</p>
<p>Roger's thoughts became unusually uneasy. He did not even like to eat, and his grandmother blamed him for being angry with his belly, blaming him for being emotional. He was not hungry, but he had no pain; a hidden cold and heat in the body was raising him. He anxiously waited for Sunday to come. He ran to the Parc de Saint-Cloud filled with the fragrance of roses to dream. He made up some very gentle songs, as if this music was coming from his heart. He made many verses that he felt were so beautiful that they brought tears to his eyes:</p>
<p>The sky is like blue satin,</p>
<p>May filled with the fragrance of wild roses</p>
<p>Pours some pearls in the jewelry box!</p>
<p>In the hearts of those purple roses…</p>
<p>And this poem ends with a repeating sentence: The sky is like blue satin! Has the poet ever written anything more vivid and novel than this? He believes not. He got some bold metaphors: "My heart is full of lilacs." He felt that there was an incredible dawn in his soul.</p>
<p>Naively, he asked himself uneasily, "But what's wrong with me? Am I going to get sick? I have a bit of cold and heat like before I had scarlet fever." But no, he feels happy! Happiness and misfortune are mixed together, he is simply confused; because his life before was so peaceful, so calm. Why does he tremble when her cherry lips reveal her snow-white teeth, smiling gracefully? Why is he eager to see her again? Three days ago, he did not know her at all. Before, he also loved his mother, his aunt, but he never had this feeling. For her, he is willing to give everything he has; yes, he has nothing, or almost nothing; apart from a beautiful annual gift book with illustrations of hummingbirds printed on it, he has nothing that she loves, but this beautiful book is hidden in the bookcase, and if he gives it to her, his aunt will be unhappy.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday he had thought about buying some rutabagas to send her, but undoubtedly, this must be a ridiculous act. And, opening his little purse, there were only six sous (Sou - one-twentieth of a franc), so he felt the sadness of poverty he had never felt before.</p>

<p>To knowingly proceed towards a broken cliff and sheer wall, venturing to seek fortune in a single gamble, that perhaps is what is called being brave. To knowingly confront tigers, wolves and pitfalls, being able to resolutely turn back, picking up and letting go, that perhaps is what is called being smart. Only those who hesitate on life's path, wandering at the crossroads, feeling unable to advance or retreat, those are the pitiful and ordinary people!</p>
<p>I am perplexed, I am distressed, only because I have too many ordinary thoughts.</p>
<p>Thought! For you I have endured unbearable melancholy, for you I have felt inexplicable sorrow, for you I have swallowed all the bitterness and spiciness of this world, yearning, pondering, dreaming... Alas! Unbearable to mention!</p>
<p>Scattered waves in the sea of mind, forming the universe's wine glass, full of many ordinary and pitiful people sinking and grieving within; yet, isn't the cause of all the commotion all for you?</p>
<p>There was a time when I wanted to dedicate myself to an armed force, listening to the frenzied shouts of thousands of troops and horses, watching the tragic spectacle of wind-borne blood on the battlefield. Miao Peilin's "Man Jiang Hong" says it well:</p>
<p>"Alone on horseback against the west wind, how many times have I traversed mountain passes and moonlit nights! See tonight the frost flowers large as palms, the battle garments like iron, with unrestrained feelings I praise Tao Yuanming's chrysanthemums, with heroic ambition I await swallowing Su Wu's snow! Alas, the north and south of the river have all fallen, the Red Goat Calamity.</p>
<p>Do not cherish, farewell to wife and children! The heart is not heated by meritorious fame! Only with me is the art of war, a few leaves of Sun Wu, a fierce tiger walks into the mountains to be captured, an ominous star in the sky has not yet been extinguished; take advantage of the autumn waves to roll up your sleeves and wash your robes, in the sandy field with blood!"</p>
<p>Reading this, I cannot help but feel heroic and want to start dancing, but thinking: once shrouded in horse hide after death, killing all over the fields; yellow sand and blue blood, vast and boundless; tragic songs and generosity, how could it not be a hero of the moment, and how could it not be a martyr of the future!</p>
<p>There was a time when I thought of the illusion of life, morning dew and passing clouds, the vastness of heaven and earth, without end. I could not help but have all thoughts turn to ash, and tears streamed down my face in sorrow, immediately hoping to quietly retreat, indifferently hide, in a bay of reeds, a few rows of declining willows, leisurely in a mountain-empty and water-quiet village, listening to the sad sobs of the gibbons, watching the seagulls coming and going, with solemn and distant intent, without years, without management and disturbance, also a god in the world, so why fear others scolding "passive"!</p>
<p>There was also a time when I thought of using poisonous wine to numb myself, forgetting the universe, the people of the world; forgetting the darkness; forgetting the ugliness; forgetting the suffering. Everything, only crazy laughter, no crying! Its name is "decadence!" Also a secret to being "modern"!</p>
<p>There was an even more time when I wanted to cater to society, oppress life, wear a skull mask, pretend to have a charming fake smile, to play with everything; regardless of what I encounter is a sincere heart, or the cold water of the head! Only jokes, only cunning, and some enthusiasm! Not even fearing the slanderous words and actions of being scolded as a "literary beggar."</p>
<p>However, I am a young man, a young man with fresh red flesh and blood, who is unwilling to linger and steal life, and even less willing to meander to death; it has made me decadent, it will make me willing to be mad, but, Thought! What have you actually given me? A task to be done.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Hometown, by Xiao Zhi <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>My hometown. I've set foot in my hometown after a full five years of separation. Here, everything is only slightly different from five years ago: the narrow, alley-like street, perpetually covered with a thick layer of muddy, broken flagstones, is still as gloomy as ever. The unique scent, a kind of intoxicating fragrance, that faintly wafts through the air, seems even stronger! The shop signs still hang low, blocking the sunlight, their colors faded. On the street corners, the idle and carefree friends are probably not all those uncles with inch-long beards they were five years ago, constantly stroking them (truly, if I were more neurotic, I'd suspect those bearded "uncles" had swallowed an elixir of eternal youth and suddenly become handsome!). They seem to be sons and young masters from some family, mostly young lads, some carrying birdcages, with cigars in their mouths, humming "Dragon's Cave". Others wear black silk trousers with wide legs that drag behind their heels and white Xiaofang long gowns with high, starched collars. Still others are dressed in neatly tailored Western suits, their hair parted and slicked back ×× from the ×× girls' school. In the narrowest street, the one with the most shops, the most broken flagstones, their footprints are the most frequent, and they are always in groups. They are gesturing enthusiastically, winking and raising their eyebrows as they chirpily flirt and comment on the female students in black short skirts and white Peter Pan-collared shirts walking along the same road. They even speak to each other in fluent Chinglish learned from Shanghai, though the black eyes under the girls' short hair never turn to look at them, and their drawn faces don't show a trace of a smile, only hidden anger and embarrassment. Nor do they consider that the mud beneath their feet might splash on the hems of their white Xiaofang long gowns with high, starched collars, which they wear every day, or the cuffs of their tailored Western suits. They are just chasing, chasing more frantically and earnestly than they eat. Besides these countless carefree young lads who seem to be sons and young masters from some family, those who can dash recklessly through the streets are, of course, our true old men wearing white or gray uniforms with leather belts.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>Many shops are filled with musicians, blowing foreign drums, foreign horns, and foreign flutes without stopping all day, their cheeks puffed out. The shops are indeed crowded with people coming and going. Although the shop assistants and apprentices are busily moving goods around, shouting, and making a great commotion, some of the gentlemen at the cash registers have taken off their copper-rimmed glasses and placed them in the wooden tray holding their writing brushes and inkstones, lowering their slightly swaying heads and leisurely writing letters home on eight-lined paper. Others are squinting, dozing off. As for the music of foreign coins clinking together and the rhythm of abacus beads clicking, that is truly too rare and precious to be easily heard.</p>
<p>Wanting to taste the local flavors of my hometown, I ventured on my own to ×× Chun, a restaurant reputed to be the biggest and most famous in the city, for dinner. As soon as I entered the dining hall, I saw that every table was full. The waiter, with an oily black towel draped over his shoulder, hurried to greet me, "Upstairs, private room." So, without thinking, I went upstairs to the private room. Oh, my heavens! Red faces, bulging veins, bare shoulders, open clothes, fists waving, mouths drinking, chewing, and laughing, the waiter running tirelessly between tables, responding to calls. Wine, meat, bones, sweat, saliva, and sounds had already filled the hall in a blurred mess! Where was there room for me to sit down? I went to another restaurant, the same! Another one, still the same! Second-class, third-class, the most basic, all equally full of customers of their respective classes, chewing loudly! I, a traveler who had just returned from afar as a guest, would probably not attract anyone's attention or be given a seat. So, I decided to go to the "× Ji Old × House," famous far and wide, to buy dry provisions. But, heaven! With so many heads, how could a stranger like me squeeze in? I steeled myself, "Let's go to △ Xiang Cun!" Indeed, it was less crowded here, but only after a succession of "old customers" had rushed to buy "four ounces of melon seeds," "half a pound of sesame brittle," "two rice cakes," and "one hundred cash of spiced beans" did a round-faced, smiling clerk, covered in sweat, hand me two loaves of bread, saying they were "from Sullivan in Shanghai, fragrant and sweet." This time, the wait wasn't an hour, but forty-five minutes, a record that probably wouldn't be broken.</p>
<p>...Anyone who is willing to take a stroll on the streets of my hometown can see these things. Yes, my hometown, the hometown of dark, muddy, narrow streets, has become a world of young lads who seem to be sons and young masters from some family, carrying birdcages, wearing high-collared long gowns, tailored Western suits, and teasing and commenting on female students, and of old men with leather belts wearing gray or white uniforms who dash recklessly through the streets. The rest are: red-faced, vein-bulging, bare-shouldered diners, waiters with oily black towels draped over their shoulders running around and responding to calls, and old customers and clerks covered in sweat rushing to buy sweets and snacks. Next, there are: musicians with puffed-out cheeks playing all day long, shop assistants and apprentices busily moving goods around, and accountants who have taken off their copper-rimmed glasses and are leisurely writing letters home, as well as silent abacuses and foreign coins that have disappeared.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Predicament, by Yun <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>To raise the rent, which could no longer be delayed, I began to feel very anxious: if I didn't pay both this month's rent and last month's rent, which had been carried over, clearly and cleanly, then the second landlord would surely force me to move out, wouldn't he? Look, wasn't the Wang family, who lived in the large厢房 and had accumulated two months' worth, forced to move out by the landlady, all seven members of the family? I heard that the Wang family was an old tenant, and I've only lived here for two years. Moreover, they usually treated the whole landlord's family with amity and harmony, with absolutely no disputes or quarrels, and yet even they were treated like this. As for me, since I don't even qualify as an old tenant, it goes without saying that I'm in an even worse position. Why? First, I'm just a new tenant who's only lived here for four months. I've hardly ever talked to the landladies. Even though I usually love children, I don't pay much attention to their grandson. You could say there's absolutely no "affection" between us. Second, I live in a亭子间 like a pigeon coop. As soon as a rental notice is posted, someone will rent it. It's very convenient and definitely not as difficult as renting out the front building's厢房. Therefore, isn't there a very good chance that I'll be "forced to move out"?</p>
<p>"Who is it? Coming." Someone knocked on the door, and Mrs. Wu, the round-faced landlady, entered in response.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zeng, why do you keep the door closed so tightly, not letting any air in?" she said calmly.</p>
<p>"Yes, I have a bit of a headache..."</p>
<p>Needless to say, as soon as I saw the landlady standing in front of me, I couldn't help but shiver, naturally feeling very embarrassed, so I just replied casually. In fact, using a headache as an excuse wasn't a very clever thing to say. If I really had a headache, wouldn't opening the door and letting the wind in be more comfortable? Then she said:</p>
<p>"A headache? A minor ailment, it's nothing to worry about."</p>
<p>"But I was planning to close the door and sleep for a while."</p>
<p>I didn't expect I could be so clever, thinking of this in the moment.</p>
<p>"That's right, you should sleep for a while. You'll feel better soon."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Wu! Would you like to sit down for a moment?"</p>
<p>"Alright, you're too kind." She said with a smile that wasn't quite a smile, "But I need to trouble you with something. I wanted to discuss something with Mr. Zeng."</p>
<p>"Okay... okay... okay..." I finally spoke up. Wasn't this about the rent?</p>
<p>"I heard you're very familiar with Mr. Wang from the × newspaper, so I wanted to ask you for a favor."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"You see, after the Wang family moved out, the big厢房 has been empty for a full two months. If this goes on for much longer, what will we do? I wanted to ask you to place a small rental advertisement for me, which might be cheaper. Saying this, she immediately took out a draft from her pocket. It read:</p>
<p>Superior Western-style house for rent, located at No. ××, Lane ××, ×× Road, one large厢房, with all sanitary facilities. Interested parties please come to this residence to discuss in person. Wu Residence."</p>
<p>"Alright, I'll definitely take care of it."</p>
<p>"Could you get a discount?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Wu, anyway, this advertisement doesn't have many words. Even if you don't get a discount, what does it matter to Mrs. Wu? Hahaha." So, I thought, hey! If she just smoked one less pipe of opium, wouldn't that save her the money?</p>
<p>"It would be best if it were half price. Please pay for the advertisement in advance and deduct it from the rent at the end of the month."</p>
<p>"Oh! But... alright, alright."</p>
<p>Finally, the landlady left, and I closed the door again. I repeated, "Pay for the advertisement in advance... alright... alright..." But, where is my money? Alas!</p>
<h3 id="e240">Conjecture on the Soul, by Qingfen <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Science in the twentieth century is flourishing like bamboo shoots after rain. However, despite the vigorous research and experimentation of many spiritualists, the study of the soul has not yet been thoroughly understood, and the question of its existence has not been definitively answered.</p>
<p>Mr. Xie ××, a mathematics professor at our school, liked to tell jokes to us mischievous students during his spare time. The stories he told were always about ghosts, souls, and demons (not comparable to other myths, as they contain quite a scientific flavor). When timid students heard his descriptions, they would often immediately see a ghost in front of them, screaming and running away, breaking the tense and silent atmosphere.</p>
<p>This time, we asked him to speak again, and he agreed to explain the soul to us. I felt that this was worth recording, so I wrote down what he said below:</p>
<p>The human body contains countless cells, and each cell contains several extremely tiny nuclei. After a person dies, the body is like a well-used tabletop with many small holes. The nuclei in the cells fly out of the holes, like dust scattered in the universe. We call them spiritual particles.</p>
<p>The nature of spiritual particles is the same as that of electrons, photons, and telivesian. When a baby is born, its body has many nests scattered throughout. Spiritual particles scattered in space seem to be attracted and drill into them. Gradually, it can make sounds and cry. In this way, countless spiritual particles are scattered throughout the universe.</p>
<p>When inanimate objects in the human world experience unusual circumstances, it triggers a kind of scientific reaction, and spiritual particles drill into them as if returning to their rightful place. When spiritual particles are organized, their actions seem the same as those of humans. The Chinese novels like Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, which talk about demons and ghosts, although based on fantasy, have a point.</p>
<p>We often hear people say that ghosts who died unjustly appear and cause trouble. (We sat closely together, our eyes fixed on each other.) Yes, because their spiritual particles still have organization in space, they are able to do this. However, over time, they gradually disintegrate from organization into sand-like particles. Their ability to appear and cause trouble gradually diminishes. Conversely, ghosts who died of illness have disorganized spiritual particles, so their ability to cause trouble is small, if it exists at all.</p>
<p>According to Dou Erde's theory of atoms, we can understand that the soul is such a thing.</p>
<p>Our ghost teacher simply exhaled a long-held breath. Our wandering hearts also settled down with it.</p>
<h3 id="e241">On "Appearances," by Bing <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>I read a very small news item in the newspaper this morning:</p>
<p>Lately, groups of beggars have been found loitering day and night near the Chen Ying Shi Martyr Memorial Tower in the Old West Gate, which is quite detrimental to appearances. In view of this, the authorities issued a strict order yesterday to ban them, and the police have immediately evicted them.</p>
<p>Originally, this fact is not surprising, and this news item is even less so. In present-day China, especially in several major cities, the number of beggars is increasing in line with the times. Since there are so many, they inevitably cause incidents. After all, these unproductive, lowly compatriots with dirty faces, tattered clothes, and empty stomachs are an eyesore no matter which side of the street you pass them on. So, they have become regular material for some news reporters, and they have their place in the newspapers every day, alongside reports of tax increases, rent increases by 20%, economic decline, and salary cuts by 20%, as if they were famous people on the move. This is not a good phenomenon, but the authorities only see it as "detrimental to appearances," so the solution is simply to "strictly evict" them. The facts are already very clear, without any need for "analysis."</p>
<p>What I can't help but say is about the "appearances" in "detrimental to appearances." Those who pay attention to world affairs, both great and small, can find this phrase used everywhere, from national laws and heavy penalties to announcements and warnings in small alleys, where it shows off its "grandeur."</p>
<p>It is commonly thought that the phrase "appearances," if expressed in colloquial terms, means "to look at." Its essence is "impressiveness." In terms of origin and usage, it has two versions: positive and negative, coexisting and interchangeable. For example, outside of certain "sufficient" facilities, if one still feels that "there are areas that are not perfect," without actually examining the essence, one must then add something "to enhance appearances." In short, it is "to beautify," meaning the scenery is magnificent, the events are wondrous, and there is something to see. This is purely from an external, concrete point of view. When used in writing, it becomes a spiritual usage, and its meaning gradually becomes mysterious. This is the positive, forward-looking meaning. The negative, however, simply changes the word at the beginning, turning "to beautify" into "detrimental." Just like strictly banning beggars, it is also related to "appearances," but it starts from a negative reduction. In fact, it is also "to beautify appearances," because reducing some incompatible elements enhances the original things. It is only a difference in designation; the essence is two sides of the same coin. Whether it is "to beautify" or "detrimental," the purpose is only "appearances," to show off "appearances."</p>
<p>Let me give you some real examples: when foreign royalty and dignitaries come to China to visit the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, the authorities must prepare in advance for the sake of "appearances," washing all the places once. If that is not enough, they will add decorations of lights to try to fit the "beautifying appearances." At the same time, in some places where there are few tourists, the grass grows to cover the ankles. Upon inspection, it is truly "detrimental to appearances," so they must quickly hire workers to cut it down overnight, which ultimately boils down to "beautifying appearances," only slightly negative. Also, when assembling troops for a military review, everyone must groom themselves, or they are given new weapons. This is "beautifying appearances." If there are those with bad habits, wearing crooked hats and slippers, this is "detrimental to appearances." Before the review, they must be strictly inspected and either ordered to change immediately or be eliminated and not allowed to participate. This is also a true situation. As for the design of school nameplates, the many humorous announcements at the ends of alleys, and the shop signs, etc., I will not mention them all.</p>
<p>Because the essence of "appearances" is "impressiveness," one only needs to strive for external appearances to finish the job. Whether there are defects in the essence is a minor matter that does not require far-sighted planning or deep investigation. All things in China can be viewed in this way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I borrow a saying from Confucius's Governance chapter: "Observe what a man does."</p>
<h3 id="e242">A Night of Debauchery, by Huo <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Having accepted the invitation from several enthusiastic friends, I entered the ×× Grand Hotel for the first time. Under the shining neon lights, I was swallowed by the huge building. Stepping onto the elevator, I muttered "608." Which floor is "608" on? "Sixth floor!" The driver with the iron-blue face stiffly spat out those two words, and I instantly arrived on the sixth floor. Bursting through the door, oh, in the stifling haze of smoke, besides the sounds of laughter, I only heard the constant clatter of mahjong tiles like popping beans. White board, fortune, three doubles, full count. To put it un-exaggeratedly, I am truly a fool. Drifting in foreign lands and sinking in major cities for nearly ten years, I am still a complete outsider to life events such as mahjong, and I even get a headache when I see others playing so enthusiastically, and even get annoyed with them.</p>
<p>"Ah Mu Lin is here!" C gentleman first raised his head, glanced at me, and said:</p>
<p>"So this is how you all are! What kind of appointment is this?" Although I am a bit of a fool myself, I am not used to others laughing at me casually. I was very unhappy and stopped them.</p>
<p>"We were just waiting for you to come. If you hadn't come earlier, we would have started playing first! Why be so serious about life!" That is to say, they were "acting according to circumstances" casually, and they were waiting for me.</p>
<p>After the meal, we returned to the room. Some fell asleep drunk, some loosened their belts after being full, spread their legs apart, and sat on the sofa, like a statue with a bulging belly. Everyone was silent, looking at each other. After about half an hour, everyone opened the conversation box: some reported on their current living conditions, some described their feelings about world affairs, and some chatted about trivial women's affairs. Only W gentleman, who had just come from his hometown, reported on the truth of the collapse of the rural areas, which was most worth listening to: He said that the harvest was abundant, and the grain was only one yuan and three corners per担, but the tenant farmers and owner-farmers were suffering, and their lives were simply unbearable. Salt, which had to be imported from outside, had to go through heavy tax cards and was sold in rural areas for 1,500 cash per catty. The farmers worked hard to grow a担 of rice, but they couldn't exchange it for a few catties of salt, so they had to eat plain food. Previously, the land tax donation was only three yuan for every two饷, but now, due to the additional security team fee, the militia team fee, and the patriotic donation, it has suddenly increased to more than twenty yuan per two饷. The common people cannot pay it, so they can only follow the officers and soldiers to taste the flavor of iron windows, or borrow at a high interest of 5% to delay the payment for one or two months.</p>
<p>As we talked, it was soon late at night, and everyone was tired. A silent atmosphere enveloped everyone's body and mind again.</p>
<p>"Everyone has nothing to say. I suggest we play another four rounds!" D gentleman, who loved this the most, fearing the continuation of silence, stretched and said this. The four of us who didn't know how to play all opposed it, and finally temporarily broke up one of their feet. But as soon as we fell asleep, we only heard the sound of mahjong in the room.</p>

<p>Act Three: Praise of Peace</p>
<p>Military Authority: Easy, easy. Thank you for your praise, I am very honored! … Secretary He, please tell them inside that Principal Zhang has come from Tianjin today, and we should give him a wash-dusting.</p>
<p>Principal: You are too kind, you are too kind, I will go back to Tianjin immediately, and come to visit another day.</p>
<p>Military Authority: Oh? Is the school very busy?</p>
<p>Principal: Yes. I should rush back to explain to the students and the people of Tianjin the true meaning of this truce, that it is by no means surrendering to the enemy, but to preserve our national vitality. Guiding the people in this way is the duty of those of us who run education.</p>
<p>Military Authority: In that case, I won't keep you any longer, because private matters are small and national matters are big. In this national crisis, we should distinguish between light and</p>
<p>heavy. Principal Zhang, is that right?</p>
<p>Principal: That is so, that is so. Okay, goodbye.</p>
<p>Military Authority: Goodbye. I won't see you off. (Secretary sees him off) (Seeing the maid enter from outside) Hey! Go tell Madam to prepare several opium bubbles for me. I'll be there in a while. (Yawns. Secretary enters from outside.) What, you still argue with this kind of person. All you have to do is give him an official position, and he'll be happy.</p>
<p>Private Secretary: Hahahaha. Minister, you are truly a great politician. I couldn't think of that method for a moment. Damn it, what is that thing? He opens his mouth to recover lost land and closes his mouth to continue resisting, which sounds extremely good. In fact, who can't say this kind of thing? Those in the opposition don't know the suffering of those in power. If I were not politically responsible, I would say it even better than him. He's not even ashamed. As soon as he hears that there is an official position to be had, he immediately stops talking big. China has too many of these scholars and celebrities. Just as he was walking to the door, he asked me to mention him to the Minister.</p>
<p>Military Authority: Isn't that just how it is? You think about why he came here, it's still to beg for an official position. All you have to do is give him an official position, give him a few hundred yuan a month, and he will never say nice things again.</p>
<p>Orderly: (From outside) Commissioner Tian is here.</p>
<p>Military Authority: Damn it, I was just thinking of going upstairs to smoke some opium, but he had to come again. (Yawns) Okay, please let him in.</p>
<p>Private Secretary: Then how should today's news be released? The newspaper reporters, who are like jumping fleas, are going to be troublesome again.</p>
<p>Military Authority: Then you think of a way to deal with them. Anyway, it's always these few words. The main thing is to state that this truce negotiation does not involve political or diplomatic aspects at all, but is entirely military. If they want to inquire about the contents of the conditions, then you can very well answer them that there are no formal negotiations at present, so the contents of the conditions cannot be announced.</p>
<p>Private Secretary: These conditions, when we formally negotiate in the future, I don't think they will change much. But how will they be published in the newspaper in the future? We need to consider that now.</p>
<p>Military Authority: Then you go and draft a draft. (Secretary goes down)</p>

<h3 id="e244">A Record of Interviews with Chinese Film Artists (5) (Continued from yesterday) <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Ji</p>
<p>(II) Zheng Zhengqiu, Director of "The Flower of Freedom" (Part Two)</p>
<p>The above can be said to be his thoughts on Chinese film directors. Afterward, regarding his own works, I sought his opinion in this way:</p>
<p>"Mr. Zheng, what are your thoughts on your recent work, 'Spring Water Love Wave'?"</p>
<p>"Regarding 'Spring Water Love Wave'?" He said with a smile, heavily inhaling from his Capstan cigarette. "Because I was sick at the time, sometimes when my illness flared up during work, I just wanted to finish quickly. Also, because the film exceeded the intended length, I temporarily cut several scenes. As a result, some characters appeared, and the audience felt it was abrupt..."</p>
<p>"Regarding the slogan to go to the Northwest," I asked, "Does Mr. Zheng think it's necessary? In this situation where China's economy is entirely controlled by world powers."</p>
<p>"There is quite a bit of factual basis to it. Before the 'September 18th Incident', there was indeed a Zhang Tianchou who went to Suiyuan to develop the land, and he did well. But after the 'September 18th Incident', it didn't work out.</p>
<p>"Naturally, there are many accidental facts in the world. However, at a time when the Northeast has been completely lost, the slogan of going to the Northwest is ultimately a cowardly hope for artists who have run out of options. Moreover, without fundamentally eradicating the power of foreign powers in China, there is no possibility of realizing this hope. Therefore, the anti-imperialist movement is the biggest task for film today. Instead of putting forward empty slogans, it is better to thoroughly oppose imperialism: especially when the Second World War is about to break out and China will become a slaughterhouse to be divided up."</p>
<p>We talked a lot this time, and I can't record it all. Of his past works, he said he was most satisfied with "The Flower of Freedom," because it was an anti-imperialist work. He is currently filming "The Nobleman and the Criminal," which is adapted from his early new drama (he said: now called civilization drama). He believes this work will not fail. It is a very emotional ethical film, and Hu Die performed very well on stage. However, he is also worried that the actors' lives are not rich enough, and that actors who lack rural life experience will not be able to realistically portray rural people. Here he raised the issue of actor training, and he hopes that various companies can jointly establish an actor training school. However, I personally believe that actors' skills are not learned in the classroom but in practical life, and he agreed with this, which can be proved by the skills of Russian actors. At the same time, he asked this publication to introduce more theoretical materials on acting techniques. Although one or two people in China have written books on this type of teaching material, the actual application of those things is terribly ugly. Most importantly, he opposes double censorship. He is worried that Chinese films will soon be controlled by political deterioration, and then he may not be able to say what he wants to say.</p>
<p>Finally, he talked about his resume: In the early years of the Republic of China, many people returned from Japan and pioneered new drama. At that time, he was the chief writer for the China Daily and often wrote reviews of plays. Later, a Westerner established the Asia Film Company and wanted to hire these new drama people to shoot films, but the conditions were not met. Therefore, through Zhang Shichuan's introduction, he gathered many people, personally wrote the script, and directed the first film, "Difficult Husband and Wife." Unfortunately, the Second Revolution occurred in the second year of the Republic of China, and war broke out in Shanghai, and the Westerner fled in shock. Helplessly, he changed the actors' profession to new drama. Plays such as "The Un-Lover" and "Bitter Milk Mother" were published. This continued for more than ten years. Then, the Shanghai "Xin Jiao" stock market craze prevailed, and the Datong Exchange was organized. After failing, he used the remaining shares to start the Star Film Company, with capital of less than 20,000 yuan at the time. His colleagues included Zheng Zhegu and Ren Jinpin. This was more than ten years ago. ((II) End)</p>
<p>Errata: In the article "The Skills of Actors and Directors and Screenwriters..." published here on the 26th of this month, the section where the word "ut" is missing in the second paragraph. That paragraph should read: "...a sound of "ut" is heard, the result will definitely be very bad. Conversely, when an actor can no longer continue an expression, an "ut" is appropriately made, and of course the result will definitely be unexpectedly satisfactory." This is hereby corrected.</p>

<p>Since Chinese films embarked on a new path in the latter half of 1929, in fact, the entire film industry's artists have been strongly stimulated and followed along this path. Naturally, this is a very good phenomenon. However, if this lineup is strictly examined, it is not only that the pace is uneven, but also that many artists seem to be forced to follow the change helplessly. At the same time, some artists are using "popularization" as a guise in an attempt to succeed in their own preaching.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, we can find proof in "Astray."</p>
<p>What does "Astray" tell us? A worker is fired for attending a "January 28th Incident" memorial service, and his family has nothing to eat, so he becomes a thief, goes to jail, and his wife is bought by a small boss. Here we cannot deny the author's sympathy for the working class. But how does the author explain this problem? In the end, the solemnity of the law is respected, which of course teaches us that the author does not have a deep understanding of the current society, but the author forcibly wants a worker's child to donate his mother's money from selling herself to national salvation through aviation, which is not only a hundred and eight thousand miles away from reality, but also far-fetched and unreasonable.</p>
<p>As for the small errors in the story, they are also common. For example, the factory owner knows that the worker is there to borrow money, but he actually tells him to go into the inner room, but he is not willing to lend him money, why would he bother like this, wouldn't it be simpler to tell him to get lost? Moreover, it is not realistic for a worker to be able to walk into the factory owner's inner room, or even to negotiate with the factory owner in person to ask for leave.</p>
<p>The director's technique is still okay, but he lacks sufficient effort in Montage. Dissolves are used where they should not be used, and the tempo is uneven.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the author's handling of the problem is very conceptual, such as using lewd dancing and drinking to express the decadence of the bourgeoisie. I feel that if a certain problem is grasped at the center, it will never be treated with empty exaggeration in a formulaic way. This aspect shows the author's emptiness of life, and it is ultimately a bold thing to deal with problems that he does not understand himself without actual life experience. Conversely, if the author is only making this kind of popular film for the sake of fashion, then of course it is unthinkable. However, we still have great hopes for the author, Zhang Tianbei.</p>

<p>— He Lian</p>
<p>This film is nothing more than a contrived story that forms a corner of the life of a group of hopeless pleasure-seekers in modern capitalist society and the phenomenon of social depression into a contrived story where all lovers become a good match. Taking the combination of the young Tang Mao, who is sinking in the casino, and the girl Mary, who is in the game venue, as the backbone, and adding Hans, the casino owner, to fight for the inheritance, it expresses the decadent side of urban life in the old style of "no coincidence, no story" that is difficult to avoid in general European and American films. The standpoint of its expression is undoubtedly like many European and American films, which stands on anesthesia, enjoyment, and self-explanation. Therefore, the poor and dark side of urban life is inconvenient to express, so at the beginning, a little bit of the situation of the poor is photographed in a very perfunctory manner, and at the same time, the author also tries to make the audience forget about it in the subsequent enjoyment and coincidental scenes. In fact, this kind of expressive attempt is really unnecessary, and these are like adding feet to a snake - judging from the original expressive standpoint of this film.</p>
<p>Since this film is like this in terms of material selection, structure, and expressive standpoint, the old style is so that there is nothing to recommend in terms of directing, acting, and other techniques. It's true that even if there are good directors and good actors, it is difficult to have excellent new expressions in this kind of film. Of course, in a prosperous city like Shanghai, there must be many people who find it very to their taste. Because they will feel quite interested in this kind of story, this kind of structure, and this kind of expression method.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Review of "The Lost Jewel" <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Bai</p>
<p>"After Dark"</p>
<p>--Carlton Cinema--</p>
<p>First of all, I have to explain that the play "The Lost Jewel" is an additional performance by the Carlton Cinema in addition to the premiere of "Midnight Dance."</p>
<p>The facts are indeed the most eloquent. In this day and age, no matter how capable you are, you have to succumb to the economic conditions of this social depression. Recently, major theaters in Shanghai have been competing to promote themselves with song and dance. Undoubtedly, this is powerful proof - that is to say, in order to maintain their business, film merchants have to use women's legs to attract audiences in this crisis in an attempt to prosper their business.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about this film.</p>
<p>This play can be said to use the saying "knowing the face but not the heart" as a principle to expose the sins of modern society. It describes a traveler returning from South Africa who is coveted for carrying jewels, and even stolen. Generally speaking, naturally it</p>
<p>s formation is relatively realistic. However, due to the screenwriter's and director's deliberate display of humor, it turned the play into a hodgepodge, which is really a pity. Just in terms of the following points, it is enough to make us feel unreasonable.</p>
<p>(1) After Henry and Harvey knocked Moulton down, they neither killed him nor tried to move him, but put him on the sofa and waited for Elva to rescue him after a long time. Obviously, this is too far from reality.</p>
<p>(2) Harvey met Henry in the old man's house. At that time, the whereabouts of the diamond were not yet known, and it was also very far-fetched to commit the crime rashly.</p>
<p>(3) Elva saw Harvey knock down Henry in the window, and it was right to go into the old man's house. But after a period of panic, he walked out safely. In fact, I'm afraid it wouldn't be like this, right?</p>
<p>(4) The old man is in this serious situation, but he is still as if nothing happened, and later when the lights are restored and the jewels have not been obtained, Moulton and Elva smile and kiss each other, as if these actions were produced in order to make people laugh.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am not saying too much, this play is so deformed entirely due to the unclear understanding of the director and screenwriter themselves. Although the actors' performances are still faithful, under the control of this kind of plot, it will never satisfy the audience.</p>
<p>However, I have to say it again! This play was originally a side play -- to put it bluntly, this is the so-called added attraction. Anyway, the women's song and dance may be able to repay the audience's price!</p>

<p>— Bolun</p>
<p>Times are changing so fast, New York is not the New York of the past. At that time: warm hotels were everywhere, and taverns and theaters were lined up. When you went out, you wore a leather coat, with the collar high, and you didn't feel the chill of the cold wind at all. You bought a seat in the first four rows when you entered the theater. Coming out of the theater, either you called for a car, and Ronald held you tightly in the car, you could even hear the beating of his heart; or you could walk home, looking at the windows of the major stores along the way, displaying red jewels, green emeralds, backless evening dresses, black velvet pajamas, dazzling your eyes and not feeling tired in your feet. But now it's different. The road a stone's throw away from the subway station is afraid to walk because of sore feet. All the hotels in the city are gone, only relief centers are seen, hungry men standing in a line, one by one going up to receive a piece of bread. In front of the employment agency on Fifth Avenue, it is also full of people. Perhaps you are also standing there, standing for several hours, but to no avail. Sometimes you see a hotel or shop hanging a sign to recruit waitresses and salespeople, but you can't hide it from the boss in the shop. If you haven't fried beef patties, you won't fry beef patties; if you haven't sold socks, you don't know how to sell them either.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was lucky, she met a Granny. With Granny's planning, Elizabeth was able to impersonate an experienced female worker and found a job in a shoe factory. On the first day of work, the foreman looked at her intently. From the foreman's hungry tiger-like gaze, she realized that he was looking at her, from her feet, past her thighs, to her waist, the curves of her youthful body had been seen through by him at a glance. Her face immediately turned red, and she was so shy that she wanted to hide: but thinking that on Friday when she got her salary, she could buy bread and beef to feed the Linberga family, she finally felt at ease to work. Moreover, there is also Ronald's future, how can she not consider it?</p>
<p>Soon Douglas found a small job in the theater. His job only required him to say the word Yes. So he practiced all kinds of ways to say Yes all day long. If he didn't believe or looked down on people, he would also say yes in the same way, but with a different kind of performance expression. The younger brother, Aidi, also found a job as an assistant in a children's playground. He was busy all day long, and his wages were one dollar a day. Douglas was not much better, his wages were twelve dollars a week.</p>
<p>At this time, the Lindberga's parlor was no longer a place for people to gather. The most comfortable sofa, the phonograph, the large dressing mirror, and Elizabeth's favorite green blanket have all been sold. The grandmother's grandfather clock has been returned to a wealthy family on Pike Street as a decoration. The good thing is that they can already not worry about hunger. They eat beef patties every Tuesday, fried saury every Wednesday, and braised beef every Thursday. But when she thought of steak, Elizabeth looked outside the door of the butcher shop. She comforted herself that steak had not disappeared and that there would be a day when she could eat it. But whether their fate is getting better day by day is still a question; even Elizabeth's work in the shoe factory is not a long-term situation, and she still has to guard against the foreman's constant frivolousness and seduction.
