<h3 id="c19">英首相渡美（上）信 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>（一）歐洲各國對立之尖銳化</p>
<p>英首相麥克唐納已接受美總統請柬。即將定期赴美共商今後世界經濟問題及其出路。美國國務院於四月七日發表將邀請意相墨索里尼。法總理達拉第·德内閣首班希特勒·親自出席於華盛頓所邀請之世界經濟準備會議。其内容何如。現雖未正式公佈。據一般觀測。與夫當局者之表示。要不外以下三大端。第一爲世界經濟恐慌丨丨市塲萎縮。生産過剩。應如何謀其恢復。第二爲軍備競爭巳屬當世之公開秘密。空軍之擴張。陸軍之充實。由歐洲西至北美。東迄太平洋。莫不積極準備。應設法疏解。至少亦當暫爲緩和。第三戰債爲歐美間之巨大癌腫。應如何治療。方可得救。以上三者皆爲英首相美總统面談之大題。現時情况何如。將來傾向何似。皆與我國間接直接發生影響。兹試簡略論之。</p>
<p>今日國際政局。立於十字路口。何去何從。各國政治當局。均苦無確切適當之决定。即各專門亦。議論紛紜。各是其是。蓋國際間兩大對立。資本主義與社會主義互不相容之外。僅以歐洲而論。德意志與意大利。皆盡力發揮其獨特的國民主義。急欲解脫目前之困難。德國則亟思打破凡爾賽和約之束縳。開闢日爾曼國民之新出路。意大利地瘠民貧。但欲平分中歐覇權。在地中海沿岸取得盟主地位。於是德意相聯。以威脅法蘭西。而與歐洲大陸相近而不相聯之英帝國。十五年之前。洵爲世界首屈一指之覇者。然自歐洲大戰之後。德國一蹶不振。法國乃指揮若定。大有脅服全歐之槪。英國秉其傳統的遺敎。絶不願歐洲有獨一無二之强國。是故德國極盛時代。在非洲在東亞幾有與英國對抗勢力之際。英國則聯法以制之。現在法國於政治上固能領導歐洲。於經濟上僅以藏金論。亦壓倒英國。此時之英吉利。爲自身前途計。乃不能不見好於德意。疏遠其曩昔同盟之法蘭西。故麥唐納氏飛渡英倫海峽而與黑衣宰相傾談軍縮。提議四强國協定也。法國處此三面威脅之際。欲保其安全。伸其國力。惟有一面聯結小協約。共制德意。另一方面。則對蘇聯示好以制英。於是綜錯之局。乃愈複雜。世界風雲。遂更低迷矣。</p>
<p>（二）世界經濟之前途</p>
<p>資本主義自發生以迄於成長。經濟恐慌。誠爲週期的循環的復演。然而恐慌期間。從未有如此次之長。其被害之烈。亦未有如此次之甚者也。矧經濟恐慌尚在發展過程之中。經濟發達至高度之國家如美如德。其生産制限。竟至於百分之七十以迄八十。價格低落。竟達三分之一以至四分之一。此種景象。在勞苦大衆。將何以堪。即豪富者（無論任何國家）巨量之貨幣資本。皆在無利息游動中。僅有投機事業。尚稱活躍。眞正之投資。則完全陷於凍結狀態。兹略舉一九二九年與一九三二年年底之生産數字及物價以爲例證。</p>
<p>生産數量　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　物價</p>
<p>美國　　（一）百分之四十七　　　（一）百分之四十七</p>
<p>美國　　（一）百分之十六　　　　（一）百分之三十七</p>
<p>法國　　（一）百分之三十二　　　（一）百分之三十六</p>
<p>德國　　（一）百分之四十四　　　（一）百分之三十一</p>
<p>意大利　（一）百分之三十　　　　（一）百分之三十五</p>
<p>今年春初。復加以美國之金融恐慌。資本主義各國。實陷於無窮之悲運。至於救濟之道。綜合各方面研究所得之結論。惟有兩途。一則爲打開現時各國封鎖式的關稅壁壘。一則爲穏定本位制度。使貨幣有流通之用無停滯之虞是也。</p>
<p>其實當世各國。由政治當局以至在野之實業家。皆曾經相當訓練。對當前之危機。亦具相當之理解與認識。豈不知經濟恐慌之來源。决不如是簡單。而救濟恐慌之策劃。亦未必如是容易。蓋各國提高關稅之反面理由。乃在於國内之自給自足。同時對海外市塲之開拓。尤未放鬆半步。其所以無濟於生産之過剩。反致市塲之縮小者。以國内一般購買力。因極度剥削而致異常衰落。合理化之管理興起。慢性的失業。遂不可救治。（機械力膨脹人工減少失業者增多）殖民地資本代興。海外消費市塲愈窄。海外投資愈多。國内産業將愈不振。益以蘇聯計劃經濟强烈之啓示。致各國社會愈感不安。經濟基礎。以消費力之低落乃愈見不穏。至於貨幣制度之穏定。僅在流通上發生若干影響。於整個的經濟恐慌。殊無多大補益也。</p>

<p>全國鐵路沿線出産貨品展覽會、經九閱月之籌備、巳於今日開幕矣、所具重要意義、蓋有數事、夫國民經濟之原理、要在調劑盈虚、斟酌有無、分配得其均衡、供求期能適應、此國民經濟之原理、亦商業上之原則也、本會之舉辦即冀使出産區域、與銷行區域、得互相溝通、使各地生産之過剩與缺乏、得有所調劑、使社會人士得以明了全國鐵路沿線之出品與産量、與夫運輸之方法、使經營商業者、得有正確統計、精詳預算、以納其營運於合理化、而國民經濟亦逐漸得平衡之發展、此本會舉辦之第一義、鐵路事業與實業商務之關係、實互爲因果、鐵路固能促進實業商務之發達、而鐵路本身亦轉賴實業商務之發達、以益臻繁榮、今則農工商礦日見凋敝、鐵路營業、因亦日見衰落、爲振興鐵路事業計、尤不能不扶植農工商礦、以謀枝幹之並茂、此舉辦本會之又一義也、以我國之地大物博、人口衆多、而一切工商事業、凋零至於此極、帝國主義之經濟侵略、固爲重創、而政府本身未盡倡導之能事與責任、實亦爲主因之一、本會舉行展覽之旨、冀能引起多數人之注意與興趣、使産量之多寡、行銷之範圍、運輸之計算、均能有一確切之統計、以爲營運者信而有徵之參考、庶幾都市中不生産之投機事業、逐漸轉爲正當工商業之投資、此舉辦本會之第三義也、</p>

<p>吾國大病、惟弱與貧、而貧又爲積弱之素因、故今日而言救國、當以增加國富爲急務、而增加國富之道舍振興實業發展國民之生産力、别無他途、此理甚明、無待詳贅惟振興實業、必有賴於運輸、尤有賴於鐵路運輸、就工業言、必求原料品之來源富而購價廉、製造品之銷路廣、而售價高、來源富與銷路廣、則須恃運輸之便利、購價廉與售價高、則須恃運價之低廉、就商業言、必求販售物品之種類多而銷量大、種類多則有恃運輸之便利、銷量大則有恃運價之低廉、就農礦林各業言、必求銷路廣而售價高、銷路廣亦有恃運輸之便利、售價高亦有恃運價之低廉、是則實業之有賴於運輸者、彰彰明甚、現代運輸機關、不外飛機·汽車·輪船·與鐵路、飛機僅限於運送少數旅客及輕便郵件、汽車亦僅便於短程輕便運輸之用、至若長途大宗貨物、則以輪船與鐵路爲主而輪船或因冬季水凍、或因風雨阻止、未能長年準確開行、其速度亦遠較鐵路爲遜、且一國之地、能通航者有限、不若鐵路之無遠弗屆、然則現代運輸機關中之以鐵路所佔地位爲最要、又無疑問矣、此總理所以謂交通爲實業之母、鐵路又爲交通之母也、實業固有恃於鐵路、而鐵路亦有恃於實業、鐵路營業、大體可分爲客運·貨運·兩種、就營業進欵而言、除極少數路線外、貨運實較客運尤爲重要、發展鐵路營業、二者雖不可偏廢、但鐵路旣以貨運爲重要、則貨運之多寡、即可影響鐵路營業之盛衰、而貨運多寡、自隨其沿線農工礦林各業之隆替爲轉移、且貨運繁興、客運亦必連帶增加、是以鐵路之繁榮、又有賴於實業之發展、實業與鐵路關係、爲唇與齒、已如上述、則可知發展鐵路必須促進實業、促進實業、即所以發展鐵路、考歐美鐵路與實業關係歷史、美國實業乃藉鐵路之便利以發展、歐洲鐵路則因實業之每榮而促成、其相互關係、有如此者、吾國實業鐵路、均在極幼稚之時代、固應分途展進、尤貴通力合作、以求共榮、此次本部以處於鐵路立塲而創辦鐵路沿線貨品展覽會蓋即本此旨也、本部之創辦展覽會、固以使鐵路實業較相發展爲目的、尤認爲本展覽會乃完成此項目的最有效之方法、蓋吾國因鐵路實業均不發達之故、以致全國的産、不能酌劑盈虚、平衡供求、往往此地所廢棄之物、即彼處所急需之品、此地有過剩之國産、彼處用類似之外貨、坐令原料廢棄、實業衰落、而鐵路營業、因以不振、此次本展覽會集鐵路沿線　種貨品於一室、分别標明其産地銷地運價等等、參觀者旣可辨别其品質之優劣、復可明瞭其有關各種情形、則過剩之貨品、可望販銷於需要之區域、凡過剩之地、物價必低、需要之區、物價必昻、是此一轉運間、不惟原料得以利用、供求得以平衡、而經營者亦可博什一之利、爲開拓之謀、無形中直接發展農工商礦林各業、間接發展鐵路營業矣、本會着手籌備、始於去年春間、由本部行文全國鐵路及沿線各省市政府、一面函請各農工商業團體徵集出品、歷時半載、始克就緒、所收物品、大别可分爲農産·林産·礦産·水産·工藝·禽畜·藥材·七類、不下一萬餘種、其間雖多爲吾人所習見之物、無若何奇珍異産、絶藝精工、足以炫耀觀衆、然而中國民衆日常所需、則巳畢具、蓋又着眼於實際民生也、本會採取巡廻展覽辦法、擬在全國鐵路所經各地、輪流開會、期將此全國實業所結晶之物品縮影、深印於各地各界人士腦海中、俾收廣告之功、以免畸重之弊、本會在滬展覽、爲期雖暫、而所希冀於各界觀衆者則甚奢、良以本會本身僅具發展實業與鐵路之方法曁途徑、若欲求其具體實現、以達此鵠的、在本部方面、固當致力於運輸之充分便利、運價之儘量低廉、以及新路之積極建築、在各界觀衆方面、亦必須各佔其本身立塲、作各業最大努力、庶幾分功合作、相輔并進、實業鐵路、同時發展、國家之轉貧爲富、轉弱爲强、實利頭之、此則於竭誠歡迎參觀之餘、所願馨香禱祝於參觀諸君之前者也、時間的關係貨品的需求、大都是帶有時間性的、如在需求的時間、不能應時供給、卽失却供求相應的效用、結果也是會影響工商業的發展的、鐵路運費是構成貨品市價的一種元素、鐵路的偉大長途運輸的能力、是推廣貨品銷塲最有效的工具、他的便利迅速輸送、是適應貨品時間性需求的特色、所以鐵路運輸、是具有左右工商業的本能的、我們如果能將鐵路運輸的本能、充分得當的運用、那末工商業的發展、是可計日而待的了、但是我們的鐵路、數十年以來、并没有充分表現他的本能、工商業各界、也没有充分利用鐵路的本能、以謀工商業的發展、所以形成今日的工商不振生産落後的現象、這次鐵道部所舉行的全國鐵路沿線出産貨品展覧會、就是來謀解决這個問題的方策、所以這次的展覽會、是很值得我們注意的、他是具有特别性質和特别價值的、他旣然是站在鐵路的立塲來謀工商　　這是鐵道為人民服務的一種表徵</p>

<p>我國因爲生産落後、人民生計日蹙、國家社會經濟、日益艱窘、差不多民窮財盡、有全國破産的趨勢推究生産落後的原因、固然是不一而足、但是工商業不振、實在是演成生産落後的最大原因、因爲我們工商業不振、不足以與各國競爭、不但是我們所出的物品、不能銷售到各國去就是我們所出的物品、在我們自己國内市塲的地位、也都被外國貨所佔據、全國差不多完全變成外國貨的市塲、我們自己的出産、旣然没有立足的地位、結果自然是日趨衰落、我們的出産越衰落、外國貨侵佔的勢力越擴張、這樣繼續下去、那能不破産呢、所以我們要打算解决人民的生計、發展國家社會的經濟、非設法增加我們的生産不可、要打算增加我們的生産、非設法發展我們的工商業不可、我們發展工商業的主策、雖然是很多、但是發展工商業最有力量的、莫過於鐵路運輸、我們如果能利用鐵路運輸來調劑貨品的産銷和供求、利用鐵路運輸、來鼓勵工商業者的進取、我們的工商業、自能有長足的進步、因爲鐵路運輸、是具有發展工商業的本能的、是與工商有密切關係的、工商業之能否發展當視貨品供求能否相應、供求能否相應、内中有幾個相關的條件、（一）貨品的成本貨品成本與購買能力是有連帶關係的、貨品的成本如果過高、他的售價、必貴、售價如超過一般的購買能力、貨品必不能銷售、結果是供求不能相應、供求不能相應、工商業自無發展的希望、（二）貨品的銷塲貨品銷塲、是與貨品出産是有連帶關係的銷塲不能推廣、出産必不能增加、出産不能增加、必至、</p>
<p>供不應求、結果工商業也是没有發展的希望（三）鐵展之外觀</p>
<p>業的發展、以促進生産的增加爲目的、那末他的作用、自然是與普通一般展覽會不同的、普通一般展覽會、大都是僅在消極方面的觀摩、比較其效果、祗能使人得到一種優劣的感覺和印象、至於如何將所得到的感覺來應用到實際上去、在一般展覽會的本身、并無促進此種第二步工作的能力、所以一般展覽會、能收實效的很少、鐵道部全國鐵路沿線出産貨品展覽會、一方面是藉貨品展覽使觀衆對於全國鐵路運輸範圍内各種貨品的産銷情形、有相當的認識、使他們對於經營工商各業、有相當的標準、使他們知道如何利用鐵路運輸、來作經營工商業的工具、使他們知道工商業與鐵路運輸關係的密切、有與鐵路合作的必要、另一方面是藉貨品的展覽、來探討貨品産銷的實况、和供求的眞情、如何使鐵路運輸方策、適合於工商業者的需要、以促進生産的增加、并不是僅止於消極方面的觀摩比較、换一句話說、鐵道部全國鐵路沿線出産貨品展覽會、是鐵路與工商業者合作的媒介、是鐵路與工商業者共同發展社會各種　業促進生産解决民生的工具、所以這個展覽會、不僅是單獨的展覽機關并且是具有促進工商業發展實力的有機體、這就是他獨具的特性和價值那末他將來的收穫、自然不是一般展覽會所能比儗的了、</p>

<p>（二）本埠張梅君來信</p>
<p>因爲農村的經濟破産，大批無法生活的勞動者和知識份子，向城市裏流來，又因爲城市裏商業緊縮，找不得　以及有業而失掉者，又大批的想回到農村去，一農村裏回得去嗎﹂的問題，就這樣的提出了，這是整個的社會問題，不是零星的個人的可以解决的，不從整個社會着想而祇從個人觀點出發，必然的碰到此路不通，因此我讀了﹁一向熱心主張農村敎育救國論﹂的尤懷臯先生答復雄聲君的信，有下列的一些疑問，（一）懷臯先生說，一到農村去的先决條件，一·你是否愛好農村，二·你是否眞心愛你的鄉村的農友，三·是否堅决任勞在農村中尋生活，一如果這是先决條件，那我們就要認定現在想回到農村裏的人們，原先在農村出來的時候，是因爲﹁不愛好農村，﹂一不愛好農村的農友，﹂一不耐勞在農村中尋生活，一他完全是好高偷懶的心理作用，而不是在農村受經濟壓迫出來的，同時也可說雄聲君想回到農村去，是因爲不愛好城市······等，這樣完全離開事實，是不會找出解决問題的路的，（二）﹁知識階級惟一出路，是担任敎育農村與興復農村，﹂這是對的，但是怎樣去敎育與興復呢，我想要敎育，先要研究牠爲所以不能受敎育的原因，自然這不能歸咎說没有敎育人材，或者說能任敎育的人材，不愛好鄉村······，同樣興復農村，先要研究牠所以破壞的原因，祗有鍍金博士們，才說農村破壞不是由於帝國主義的侵略而是由於﹁蠢﹂，由於不知道﹁組織﹂丨如合作社等，不除掉破壞的原因那是像水淹了田，不去修堤，只去車水，自然是勞而無效，長沙有位努力鄉村敎育的先生，把他的精力和敎課所得的薪金都用在這爿學校上，結果敎育成績有丨，大興復就說不上，而且該處農村的破産，隨着點勢一樣加深，並不因那裏有個這樣努力的人而和緩點，這位老先生到六十多歲，才恍然大悟，現已抛棄他那爿學校，丨丨他的學校正和懷臯先生所理想的一樣或者還要好，丨丨毅然參加所謂整個的改革運動去了，因此我敢說這樣新村式的運動，不是出路，他不改造農村整個生活，自然個人生活及如懷里先生說的﹁你就是一村中的領袖，可進行村治的工作，﹂也無法實現，（三）懷臯先生只在意到知識階級回到農村裏的問題，卽知識份子個人的出路，没有看見成千成萬由鄉村擠出的勞勵預備軍（自然這裏面也不少知識份子，）（四）就余知識份子個人講，﹁要尋一處生産豐富，生計繼裕······的農村，在這農村中居······，﹂老實講，如果一比較生産豐富，生計優裕﹂，他早就不會從﹁安定﹂的農村滾到這茫茫無靠的城市來，就是來了，遇到碰壁，馬上就回去，用不着來請敎﹁讀者顧問欄﹂的先生，要知道現在大部份的農要兒童、他要尋野菜打柴喂牛······，帮助父母做塞肚子的工作學校不要錢，他還不肯來，這是我親眼看見的，如果﹁整千整萬的各國回來的留學生及大學中學的畢業生﹂尚有些﹁比較豐富生計優裕······的農村﹂可容納，他們早去了，决不要勞﹁農村敎育論者﹂來指敎，他才肯放棄﹁不愛好農村﹂的觀念，才不滯留在失業而且至於要餓死的都會、改造社會、整個的改造社會、有志的靑年們應該向　條奮鬥的路上走，個人主義的新村式的改造運動，已經是過時的東西了！（尚有四函，明日繼續發表）</p>

<h3 id="c172">殺錯了人 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>前日某報載某君述長春歸客的談話，說：日人在僞國已經完成﹁專賣鴉片﹂和﹁統一幣制﹂的兩大政策。這兩件事，從前在老張小張時代，大家認爲無法整理，現在他們一舉手之間，辦得有頭有緒。所以某君嘆息道：﹁愚嘗與東北人士論幣　紊亂之害，咸以積重難返，諉爲難辦；何以日人一刹那間，即畢乃事？﹁是不爲也，非不能也。﹂此爲國人一大病根！﹂</p>
<p>豈獨﹁病根﹂而已哉！中華族的滅亡和中華民國的顛覆，也就在這肺癆病上。一個社會，一個民族，到了衰老期，什麽都﹁積重難返﹂，所以非﹁革命﹂不可。革命是社會的突變過程；在過程中，好人，壞人，與不好不壞的人，總要殺了一些。殺了一些人，並不是没有代價的；於社會起了隔離作用，舊的社會和新的社會截然分成兩段，惡的勢力不會傳染到新的組織中來。所以革命殺人應該有標準，應該多殺中年以上的人，多殺代表舊勢力的人。法國大革命的成功，即在大恐慌時期的掃蕩舊勢力。</p>
<p>可是中國每一回的革命，總是反了常態。許多靑年因爲參加革命運動，受了犧牲；革命進程中，舊勢力一時躱開去，一些也不曾剷除掉；革命成功以後，舊勢力重復湧了出來，又把靑年來做犧牲品，殺了一大批。孫中山先生辛辛苦苦做了十來年革命工作，辛亥革命成功了，袁世凱拿大權，天天殺黨人，甚至連十五六歲的孩子都要殺；這樣的革命，不但不起隔離作用，簡直替舊勢力作保鏢；因此民國以來，只有暮氣，没有朝氣，任何事業，都不必談改革，一談改革，必﹁積重難返，諉爲難辦﹂。丨其惡勢力一直注到現在。</p>
<p>這種反常狀態，我名之曰﹁殺錯了人﹂。我常和朋友說：﹁不流血的革命是没有的。但﹁流血﹂不可流錯了人。早殺溥儀，多殺鄭孝胥之流，方是邦國之大幸。若亂殺二十五歲以下的靑年，倒行逆施，斵喪社會元氣，就可以得﹁亡國滅種﹂的﹁眼前報﹂。</p>
<h3 id="c173">遲暮 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 江愛綸</p>
<p>已是上燈的時候了，芙仙知道自己早已感着厭倦的，那不可避免的生活，又將開始。她懶洋洋地坐在妝台前收拾起來。鏡裏照着她那殘花似的憔悴的影兒，她愈加感覺自己是一個遲暮的美人。這幾年來供人玩弄的賣笑生涯，自己回憶起來，也辨不出是苦是酸。</p>
<p>年輕的妹妹麗仙，已裝束得妖妖嬈嬈地，小鳥般，飛到東，飛到西，兀自對她姊姊絮絮地談着隔壁和對鄰的一些瑣屑事情。芙仙雖一向疼愛着妹妹，從不曾在妹妹身上找到什麽壞處，但是今天却也有些討厭妹妹了。</p>
<p>從酒樓菜館方面發來的紙條，一片一片地飛來，芙仙終於經不住車夫的催促，把妹妹疊在自已的膝上，讓車夫拉着飛跑。</p>
<p>這樣，從一個酒樓到一個菜館，再從那個菜館到另一個酒樓，按着紙條的催喚，一個個都應酬過了，又依舊姊妹倆疊坐着一部包車跑回來。</p>
<p>在歸途上，芙仙遇到不少坐着裝有雪亮的電燈的與自己度着同樣賣笑生活的姊妹，她覺得她們都有一股使人難以相信的靑春的驕傲。她們給她的這種剌激實在太利害了，於是適纔酒樓菜館裏的情景，又一幕一幕地映上她的腦膜。</p>
<p>那些貴客們現在對她多是愛理不理的，祗對於妹妹麗仙，顯得異常慇懃，因而麗仙便時常被包圍在客人的垓心，而自己却冷坐一隅。她察覺妹妹已會用一種奇妙的迷人的目光，去蠱惑那般追逐她的男子。不用說，麗仙已是受到相當的訓練了。但是自己何嘗不會照樣做呢？何嘗不懂得﹁秋波戲媚，巧笑迷人﹂的秘訣呢？可是做了怎樣？那些貴客們還會對三十多歲的芙仙發生好感嗎？這是自己都不相信的。</p>
<p>她看了看坐在自己膝邊的妹妹，覺得妹妹正如一朶含苞初放的嬌麗的花兒，而自己却已是暮春三月的落英。可是，一想到妹妹到了自已一般的年齡時，她眼中不覺感到一陣糢糊。</p>
<p>到了自己家門口了，妹妹下車時，瞧見姊姊眼中含着一包涙水。</p>
<p>﹁姊姊！怎樣了？身體不好受嗎？﹂</p>
<p>﹁妹妹！没有什麽。﹂她拿起妹妹的嫩手吻一下。</p>
<h3 id="c174">弟弟 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 裘鵬</p>
<p>默默的把花圈安放在墓上，只聽見四面的野草正給風吹得蕭蕭的響，想着孤獨的長眠在這一堆黄土之下的，就是自己的那個可憐的弟弟，禁不住心裏湧起了無限凄愴的回憶：</p>
<p>我出世後三年，弟弟便相繼産生在我家。因爲從小就生得愚蠢，什麽事都吃虧。在校裏常常給師長責打，遭一般大孩子們欺侮；回到家來，父親也從没有好聲氣對待他。在本來巳經是十分貧困的給養下生活着的一家子，弟弟是更壞一層的常常在飢餓和寒冷的環境裏掙扎着。</p>
<p>十三歲，初小才畢業，父親就把他送到離家十幾里遠一個小鎭上的一家雜貨舗子裏做學徒。那家舗子只有唯一的一個老閭，弟弟就拜了那人做先生。以後我每次到那家舗子裏去看他，總看見那位老閭一個人淸閑的坐在店堂裏剥指甲，而弟弟却滿頭滿臉全是烏煤，不住的從灶披間鑽出來，又鑽進去。好容易抓住了一個空和他談話，他就滾着眼涙悄悄的告訴我：</p>
<p>﹁先生要我做店裏的事，又要我燒飯，我燒不好，或是偶然失手打碎了碗盞，他就要打我駡我。·····我不願住在這裏，哥哥帶我回去吧！﹂</p>
<p>﹁回去爸爸要打死你。你且耐心在這裏住住吧！﹂</p>
<p>雖然心裏儘是不忍讓他在那裏吃苦，可是一想起父親那凶暴的脾氣，那愈加困苦的家境，就没有勇氣帶他回去。但過不了多久，弟弟終於一個人逃回來了。當父親睜大了眼珠暴怒的用鞭子抽着他的時候，我禁不住流着涙在父親的跟前跪下來替他求饒。</p>
<p>後來恰巧父親有一個朋友在乂乂縣開米行，弟弟就給轉送進了那家米行做學徒。</p>
<p>因爲那裏離開得比較遠了，以後我便很少有機會去看他。但從他每次寄回的信裏，我知道他依然在困苦的環境裏掙扎着。他說他因爲每天要帮着他們去肩</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>﹁林先生太看不起人了。我也是女子中學畢了業來的。英文成績雖然差一點，可是我的國文，每期考試都是甲喲。郭沫若譯的少年維持之煩惱，我都念得下去哩。何况一個女子中學生寫給你的情書！林先生，不要太看不起人了！·········﹂</p>
<p>海泉聽着她說了一大篇話，最初當她是說笑話。但是到後來，看見她的臉上還是没有半點笑痕，並且抱着小孩子，一聲不嚮地走回她房裏去了。</p>
<p>﹁這眞是意外！自己竟不知道她的脾氣是這樣的！失敗了！失敗了！不該不留心說錯了那一句話﹂！</p>
<p>海泉想，她旣然是個那樣小氣的女子，那末一定要向他陪一個禮才好。於是他也跟着走進房裏來。他想，下午要參加示威游行了，如果運氣不好，被捉了去，給統治階級判了一個一年以上的徒刑，那就不知要到什麽時候才能夠看見她們了。丨丨或許是永久不得見面了！他想到這裏，又悽然起來了。他又想，自己對於秋英，雖不覺她是怎樣可敬愛的女性，但她對自己的心總是好的。就這一點說，也應當歡歡喜喜地把兩人間的交情維持下去。</p>
<p>﹁她是在自己參加示威游行之前所能看見的唯一的女性友人！﹂</p>
<p>他無端地起了一陣不必要的傷感。他在這瞬間，只當秋英是佩珠和鶴子夫人的化身了。</p>
<p>他忘掉了她的淺俗的可厭的性格，覺得她的風致也有幾分的動人。</p>
<p>﹁師奶，剛才我說錯了，對不住了。······﹂</p>
<p>﹁························﹂</p>
<p>但是秋英抽了一下鼻子，便袒露出乳房來喂奶給小孩子吃，一聲不響，臉微低下去。但看得出在她臉上是浮着一些微笑。他想，她專是玩這一套的手段。一穏特殊的衝動促着他傾向她了。</p>
<p>那個小孩子，幾天來和他頑熟了，看見海泉走近他媽媽的身邊來，便丢開了母親的乳房，翻轉來向着海泉咭咭地痴笑。海泉乘機低頭凑近來逗小孩子笑。他的臉差不多觸着她的胸口了。</p>
<p>﹁吃奶哩！﹂</p>
<p>她微笑着叱她的小孩子，把玫瑰色的乳嘴又　進小孩子的口裏了。</p>
<p>﹁師奶，你這樣地惱我麽？······﹂</p>
<p>﹁誰惱你？我又不是你的什麽！﹂</p>
<p>那沉重的米袋，常常晚上感到週身骨骼酸痛。他又說他近來很想偷空看點書，要我檢幾本淺近點的書寄給他。他說每次瞧着那些哥兒們背着書包上學堂，心裏便又妒又恨，說不出的難過。</p>
<p>兩年後，我的一個朋友願意介紹他到福建省乂乂縣一家書局裏做學生。</p>
<p>當我把這消息告訴他的時候，我們担心他會不肯去。丨那樣小的年紀，一個人遠離家鄉千餘里！可是事實却出於我們意料，他竟欣然答應了。他說他到那裏可以不必再做苦力，而且還可看到許多的新書，他說書局正是他理想中的天堂··········</p>
<p>但想不到去那裏只短短的一年，弟弟便在舉目無親的異鄉病亡了。當我突然接到了那個電報，我的心眞像沉在無底的深淵了。</p>
<p>而今弟弟的遺骸搬回故鄉埋下又巳一年了，我每次走過弟弟的墳前，便有無窮的悵觸，一想到弟弟短短的十多年生命裏所受的種種苦楚，便忍不住流涙。眞的，弟弟好像生來祗是爲着遍歷人世的艱辛而更没有其他的目的似的！好殘酷的運命喲！</p>

<p>（十五）四川人與茶</p>
<p>前曾爲四川人與鴉片一文，頗疑中國人之種植鴉片與服食鴉片，始自四川人。閱日人矢野仁一之近代中國政治及其文化，論及中國人飲茶之起源，考證精瞻，頗啓予思，又疑中國人飲荼亦始自四川人矣。古字無茶，但有茶耳。荼字始見詩經，如﹁誰謂荼苦？其甘如薺。﹂訓爲苦菜，非屬木類。爾雅釋木，檟，苦荼也。晉郭璞註，檟樹小似梔子，冬天生葉，可煑羹飲，早采者曰荼，晚采者曰茗曰荈，蜀人稱爲苦荼。此所謂荼，蓋即今之所謂荼也。爾雅舊說周公所作，仲尼所增，子夏所益，叔孫通所補。四庫全書提要證其成書在毛亨以後，大抵小學家綴緝舊文，遞相增益。特此而言，飲茶之說最早見于爾雅，飲茶之事至遲始于漢初，蜀人稱爲苦荼，可謂尤爲知味者也。漢宣帝時，王褒作僮約，中有﹁炮鼈烹荼﹂﹁武陽買荼﹂語。宋章樵註，前荼苦菜，後荼即茶。武陽王褒之故鄉，今屬四川彭山縣。買茶必于武陽，豈武陽已爲當時産茶名地耶？晋初孫楚詩，亦曾說及蜀爲産茶最早之地。章樵訓武陽買荼之荼爲茶，固未嘗不是也。晉張載在成都，登白兎樓詩有﹁借問揚子宅，想見長卿廬﹂語。又云﹁芳茶冠六淸，溢味播九區。人生苟安樂，兹土聊可娱。﹂唐陸羽茶經歷數古來嗜茶之有名人物，謂﹁漢有揚雄司馬相如。﹂司馬相如凡將篇有荈字，吳志韋昭傳有﹁荼荈以當酒﹂語。又茶經引揚雄方言，蜀西南人謂茶曰蔎。就以上諸說證之，可見自漢初始有飲茶之習以來，四川人與茶特别有緣，四川旣爲産茶之名地，而蜀中辭賦之豪如司馬相如王褒揚雄之流，又皆當時嗜茶之名流也。</p>

<p>七比二葡萄牙敗下陣來</p>
<p>觀衆七千餘表演頗精彩</p>
<p>孫錦順李義臣射門出色</p>
<p>已有攸久歷史之中葡盃足球賽、本年創議恢復、昨日下午三時首次交兵於中華棒球塲、雖則天色陰蠭、春雨連綿、觀衆依然十分興旺、勞神父路、汽車塞途、球塲四週、座爲之滿、達七千餘衆、兩隊人馬整齊、表演精彩、歡乎呐喊之聲、如萬馬奔騰、如山崩地裂、結果中華以七比二大敗葡萄牙、雙方表演、均極精彩、惟久雨之後、塲地蓄水飽滿、泥滑不堪、不利奔跑、球着泥與水之浸染、重量過份、跑不快、踢不遠、實爲美中不足、兹記經過情形如下、</p>
<p>兩軍實力　葡萄牙威名素著、的是不凡、結果雖敗、其表演却令人稱賞不止、谷史坦·雷米狄·及柯拉沙等、驍勇非凡、中華隊陳鎭和未出場、由萬象華担任左翼、前鋒如一部機器、工作努力、後方戒備嚴密、無懈可擊、而孫錦順與李義臣之攻門本傾、尤足使人讚美不止、雙方陣容如下、</p>
<p>中華隊</p>
<p>周賢言李寗王樹森上關洵安下梁樹棠馮運佑屠開元萬象華孫錦順李義臣陳家球陳虞添</p>
<p>葡萄牙</p>
<p>馬塞爾Ｐ谷史坦下葛悌列上Ａ雷米狄下谷史坦上Ａ柯拉沙雷米狄上Ａ谷史坦下護奎那告山奴下拿特上題那Ｈ柯拉沙浪哥兒洛萊</p>
<p>中華受創　中華開球先攻、葡萄牙咄咄逼人、敢勇非凡、中華戒備得法、不稍動搖、李獲臣孫鑄順帶兵殺還、無功而還、葡方邊陲入寇、洛萊在底角處傳球門前、柯拉沙離門約七八　得球射門、以爲必中、奉被周賢言擋出、險極險極、中華方以爲可高枕無憂、安知一波方平、一波又起、葡軍中路殺入、幾次傳遞、柯猛力掃射、球向門柱擦入門内、周賢言仆地未得、乃負一球、四座爲之愕然、</p>
<p>還敬兩球　中華失守以後、中央開球、直搗葡軍腹地、前綫阿成一氣、呼應得力、惟因地上泥滑、脚下作不來主、馮運佑向後策進、混戰聲中、老馮暗渡陰平、冷箭射中、還敬一球、從此中華聲勢益壯、萬象華沿邊衝進、阻於敵人、即挑球與孫錦願、孫竄前帶球衝上、比及門前、正待射門、又阻於谷史坦、即撥球與李義臣、李一舉成功、又獲一球、成二比一、</p>
<p>再來一個　此後萬象華一度孤軍深入、攻門無效、是球若能傳與候立門前之李義臣、必中無疑、混戰許久、陳虞添邊　起義、挑球中央、義臣　得、地滑失却、孫錦願衝前攻入門内、此球義臣已經越位、裁判員因遠居後方、未能細察、中華遂以三比一佔優、葡軍屢興問鼎之罪、射門不少、幸賴周賢言撲救得法、李王二將阻攔周密、毫無差池、故葡軍莫奈何也、</p>
<p>各中一只　休息再戰、十分鐘内、雙方均無機可圖、驚險亦少、惟球勢依然極盛、精神一貫、故興趣不减、旋見李義臣深入門邊、還球門前、孫錦順向前掃射未着、俄而孫錦順又得一機、卒被射中、此球騰空飛進門角、極爲美觀、雙方愈戰愈有精神、四座嬌聲不絶、一元座中之貴屬女賓、得意忘形、看得津津樂道、嬌聲呐喊、球場爲之生色不少、忽而葡隊全軍侵入中華陣地、中華後方努力抗拒、扭成一團、卒爲周賢言脫身抛球出去、化危爲安、但柯拉沙捲土重來、急射一球、鵠的命中、成四比二、</p>
<p>連中三元　往後葡軍氣燄稍衰、雖個個猶努力效命、奔馳角逐、但陣綫頗見混亂之象、顯見不支、被中華李義臣孫錦順連中三元、倍增威風、每球之得、射來均有力道、不同凡嚮、中華旣以七比二勝、乃不再事多求、數衍殘局而已、下次戰期、已定星期六（十五日）、中葡盃究屬誰得、且待下回分解、</p>

<p>結果四十三比三十三</p>
<p>聖大球隊昨日抵滬今晨起程赴日本</p>
<p>一行十五人赴日本比賽棒球十六次</p>
<p>菲律賓聖托麥斯大學遠征球隊、於昨日下午二時乘俄國皇后輪抵滬、在新關碼頭登陸、歡迎者有全國體育協進會代表施肇康及各報體育記者、上岸後卽出外購物、赴四川路靑年會小息、當晚七時半、卽赴中華籃球房與東華籃球隊比賽、該隊雖長途跋踄、辛苦非凡、然諸能以四十三比三十三勝東華、實力之强、可想而知、該隊於昨晚比球完畢後、卽登原輪、於今晨八時離滬、經赴日本、在長崎登陸、在日本共擬比賽棒球十六塲、然後赴火奴魯魯比賽、再行返菲云、兹將詳倩分誌如下、</p>
<p>遠征秩序　該隊一行十五人、於四月三日下午四時由菲律賓馬尼拉起程、五日中午抵香港、共比賽籃球兩塲、棒球一塲、七日中午離港來滬、於昨日抵埠、當晚卽與東華比賽籃球、今日上午八時離滬赴日本、在長崎上岸、在日本共比賽棒球十六塲、五月底六月初赴火奴魯魯、返菲約在七月中旬、</p>
<p>一行人員　領隊榮氏Capt·DYond、球員名單如下、派泰新·鮑的斯泰·那台爾·桑托斯·柯列那·雅新泰·薩巴隆·别爾巴·曼的納·史坦路沙·勃浪特·封太維拉·葛姆勃·雪爾凡·一行共十五人、</p>
<p>棒球實力　該隊目的在赴日本及奴魯</p>
<p>魯比賽棒球、籃球實係帶頭戲耳、其棒球實力殊强、有上屆遠東代表多人、此次新約三大學冠軍、又爲全菲職業棒球賽亞軍、</p>
<p>籃球實力　籃球雖係其帶頭戲、但實力亦殊强、亦係馬尼拉三大學籃球賽冠軍、且係菲律賓業餘運動協會主辦之馬尼拉籃球錦標賽之優勝、與阿的那隊Ａlenio並列對崎、因該項比賽、分爲兩部、該隊與阿的那各佔一部之優勝、但未决賽耳、昨晚出塲之雪爾凡·格媾　·曼的納及雅新泰四人、均係錦標賽之正式隊員、</p>
<p>在港戰績　該隊抵香港後、與香港籃球冠軍南華隊在靑年會比賽、該隊以四十二比二十八勝、翌日又與香港籃球亞軍比賽、該隊又以五十八比四十二勝、棒球比賽、對南華會、結衆十二比三、亦係該隊勝、</p>
<h3 id="c199">昨晚籃球勝東華 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>該隊自昨日由香港抵滬後、晚上七時半卽赴中華籃球房、與滬江改名之東華籃球隊比賽、事前消息傳出、用籃球癖者、無不枵腹光顧、籃球房塵爲之滿其、盛况猶勝過萬國籃球决賽也、菲隊技術、不同凡嚮、奔馳如餓虎撲食、跳躍如飛鳥　翔、活潑矯捷、堪嘆觀止、籃下工作、尤見利害、每於人叢中、傳遞投籃、不可捉摸、東華卽滬江大學隊、另加老將陸鍾恩一人、實力較前且大有進步、表演亦甚出色、但相形之下、實非菲隊之敵、菲隊實力强硬、東華雖曾一度造成平手、但該隊毫不氣餒、胸有成竹、操得勝劵、似極有把握者然、故最後結果、菲隊卒以四十三比三十三勝、裁判張國勛與李祖祺、</p>
<p>平等局面　電炬照耀、仕女歡呼聲中、兩隊開始撲門、東華先發制人、馮念華·錢敬鑄·連得兩球、一時氣熖頗盛、菲隊施展妙技、極盡傳遞撲門之美事、博得采聲滿塲、嘆爲奇觀、但塲地不熱、投籃每不能稱心如意、故不得不暫告屈服、東華以七比三佔先、但第一節終了）菲隊卒能造成九比九之平手、</p>
<p>菲隊佔先　稍事休息、繼續再戰、馮念華又先命中、再佔優先、但天有不測風雲、人有旦夕禍福、吳國霖怱於斯時脚傷退塲、由陸鍾恩替入、陸鍾恩改隸中鋒、陣容不免鬆懈、菲隊一鼓而下、格姆勃先中三球、派泰新增上二分、突然以十七比十三超出東華、是時吳國霖脚愈重行入塲、分庭抗禮、陸鍾恩錢敬鏞加上兩球、菲隊則又得五分、上半時終了、菲隊二十二分、　華十七分、</p>
<p>劇戰時期　易籃再戰、菲隊中鋒及左内衛易人出戰、格姆勃兩中之後、東華忽然得勢、孫賣慶兩發兩中、馮念華加上三分、比數怱成二十四比二十六、東華如絶路逢生、精神一振、觀衆亦愈覺興奮、以爲後來居上、揚眉吐氣、有期待矣、惟斯節表演、大爲减色、雙方陣容、俱見散漫、劇烈聲中、動作不免過於鹵猛、反無先前之淸爽美觀矣、</p>
<p>最後勝利　再後一節、菲隊仍由上半時之正式陣線出塲、東華求勝以切、反攻極烈、菲隊豈肯示弱、還以眼色、互相爭先、各不相讓、只殺得個個氣喘如牛、揮汗如雨、菲隊處處得以應手、又一度以三十三比二十七勝、東華錢敬鏞中的後、馮念華兩次遠射命中、個個精神抖擻、氣燄如熾、陸鍾恩罰球又中、怱成三十三比三十三、不分高下、東華至此、以爲可以操得勝劵、安知菲隊不慌不忙、徐圖宏展、雪爾凡連中四球、雅新泰加上一只、一刹那間、連獲十分、東華乃敗下陣來、比數爲三十三比四十三、</p>

<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第四章業務之情形</p>
<p>除了一般新醫之外，再說所謂西醫公會會員的業務。丨丨他們的開業術，往往很好，宣傳力也很大，收費成者很經濟，因此業務也很忙。平心而論，其中有幾位頗能打極純熟的針，此外門診出診，一切的一切，本和其他醫師没什麽表面上的分别，就只有幾種特點是眞確的事實；（甲）西醫公會會員頗有能開舊式湯頭藥的；（乙）上海市内没有西醫公會會員辦理的正式醫院，更没有該會會員在任何公私立醫院充當主任醫師；（丙）該會没有什麽出版物，更没有該會會員所著的論文；（丁）該會會員講專家的以花柳專科爲多，並有講白濁專科的，而其他各科不經見；（戊）各醫學校没有該會會員，當敎授而講西醫法的。丨丨因此可以說西醫公會會員，與其他的新醫在業務上本不受範圍之限制，而於造就之來歷，和學理之程度，有些分别罷了。在無論那一國的過渡時代，本來容易發生這種現象，原要政府和社會並由醫界本身同時起來補救，不是一律抹煞就可了事。但願西醫公會的會員也須認淸了這條途徑，方有改良中國醫藥的希望。若認爲我今日的饒舌，是對於該會會員有心加什麽貶辭，那就没有辦法了。本文下面還有醫政一章，叙述綫索，較爲詳畫，平心靜氣讀之，當可了然的　　（乙）新藥界的業務</p>
<p>至於新藥界的業務，在三十年以前是很不發達的，除了洋人所開藥房，專供外國人民外國醫生請敎之外，華人自辦的藥房，歷歷可數。中西中英等幾家已是極老的牌子，而當時因爲新醫數目不多，還有自行配方給藥的，所以各藥房的唯一營業，不外乎販賣歐西騐良藥，（今稱成藥）兼售化妝香品，洋貨什物，至今内地藥房帶賣毛巾雨傘，還是當時的傳統。後來有藥房大規模推銷他的自製成藥，而用宣傳方法，就引起了無數人的懷疑，黄楚九的中法藥房出艾羅補腦汁，就得了滑頭的雅號。其實艾羅補腦汁不過中國製造的外國成藥，黄氏不過利用國人拜外的心理，多用了些西文名稱，加上些西洋色彩，並没有其他欺世的行爲。然而時至今日，投機藥商市上要多少？欺世藥品市上要多少？反而没有聽見說上海出了第三四個滑頭。這種狀况，一方面可以證明世道人心，今遜於昔；一方面可以證明外國的科學，一天發達一天，而我國人民的科學知識，跟踪不上，於是社會上的鑑别力，却反而一天薄弱一天，眞是痛心的事。近十年以來，因新醫之增多與進步，新藥業自然也隨之而擴大。增添的是配藥商，販藥行，成藥商，製藥廠等門類，而改良的是配方商漸漸由學徒工役式走到了專家學術式，各藥房都有藥劑師了，販藥商也由洋廣雜貨而改進到專售藥品了。</p>
<h3 id="c202">淋病難以治愈的理由和正確的治療法（下） <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 劉筠壽</p>
<p>（四）其他的一切這也很多，第一病人等待淋病的急性症候經過了，變成了慢性，因爲没有痛苦，不肯再繼續醫治斷根；第二因爲病人不懂得攝生的道埋；（參觀拙著﹁性病指迷﹂大東書局寄售）第三是經濟的問題，不能長期就醫；第四是職業的關係，不便就醫；第五是夫婦二人不能同時就醫，致成互相傳染的境地；第六是信任一切不正當醫治的緣故，以致延長治愈的時日。</p>
<p>上面講明了淋病難以治愈的理由，和一切療法的利弊，然則吾人如何去尋一個最正確的治療方法呢，現在也逐條的記在下面：</p>
<p>（一）頓挫療法　淋病愈早醫治，愈見功效，最好在淋菌傳染一二日，（就是不潔交接後一二日）還未見著自覺的症候和排膿，用一種殺菌的藥劑，注入尿道内，不過數日，即可注愈，這就呌做頓挫瘡法。但是大多數的病人，來到醫師處醫治的時候，多是已經有疼痛和大量膿汁的排泄了，在這個時候尿道上面的淋菌，不但是在粘膜上面，已經侵入到粘膜下面的組織，倘能有秩序的加以治療，淋病的治愈，也並非難事。</p>
<p>（二）局部治療　淋菌是在尿道内，所以尿道内的洗滌和藥液的點滴，自然是最緊要了。應用的藥劑，雖是頗多，但是在原則上也不外乎有淋菌的時候，應當用殺菌劑，淋菌消滅炎證未退的時候，應當用收斂劑，一面還要視察病人的狀况，小便的性質，把藥劑的種類，注入的回數，注入量，濃度，以及停留尿道的時間等等，有相當調節的必要，並不是有一定不變的程序。治療時日經過的多少，全在醫師應用藥劑手段的如何，往往有淋菌已經消滅，再注入强劇的殺菌劑，或是淋菌衆多，使用輕淡的藥劑，不但不見功效，反而增長病勢，或是延長治愈的時日，所以應當常常用顯微鏡去檢查淋菌和觀察小便的變化。就是擇定藥劑的種類分量和一切的標準了。</p>
<p>還有注入的藥劑，不但是僅僅要殺滅尿道粘膜上表面的淋菌，還要殺滅各種腺　或側管内潛伏的淋菌。（後述）</p>
<p>一種慢性的淋病，尿道組織有了侵潤，雖則是每日注入藥液，依然不見功效，那時候非另外設法，能夠使藥液容易入不可。</p>
<p>（三）注射法　如應用黄色素苗漿等，都是一種醫治淋病的補助方法。</p>
<p>（四）尿道鏡檢查　明白了上述尿道組織的性質，就可以知道淋菌容易潛伏到尿道側管　立氏　等部位，日後因飲酒勞　交接等，淋病再發的原因，就在於此。所以等到尿道炎證約略治愈的時候，或慢性不易愈的時候，用尿道鏡去檢查淋病的病灶，（病灶就是病菌的巢窠），豈非是一件緊要的事嗎？</p>
<p>（五）手術療法　尿道内旣然有了病灶，爲淋病再發的根據地，用了尿道鏡檢查著後，應用小小的尖刃刀去切開他，使病灶破潰，或用藥液點滴。</p>
<p>（六）﹁步其﹂療法﹁步其﹂是一種金屬所製彎曲的圓桿，有大小種種的號數，尿道手術後，創面治愈，用﹁步其﹂揷入，可以使尿道内的皺裂伸展，注入的藥液，可以達到全粘膜面以及側管竇腺的裏面。且因﹁步其﹂的剌戟，使尿道組織的血行佳良，發生健全的上皮，在淋病治療前後，﹁步其﹂的應用，也很緊要。　　（七）内服藥　内服藥雖然没有特效藥，但是也很能帮助，用什麽的藥劑，那是只好臨機應變了。</p>
<p>（八）瘧疾治療　現在對頑固的淋疾，有用瘧疾療法，但是試騐的成績不多，應用也不廣。</p>
<p>（九）攝護　腺攝護腺内往往爲淋菌的巢窠，可以攝護腺的檢查和治療，也是很緊要的。</p>
<h3 id="c203">現社會醫藥狀况的觀察（下） <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 計濟霖</p>
<p>至於新醫所以不能十分得一般社會的信仰，也有幾個原因。第一，我們國民向來有一種自在的心理，由外洋輸入的東西智識學問，不管他是好是壞，視爲一種方外之學，不但不去學他，而且加以絶對的攻擊和排斥。譬如西洋的機器工業的確比中國好；可是一般社會上總不肯死心塌地的說一句，﹁我們眞不如他們；﹂偏要說：﹁他們的物質文明雖比吾們好，但我們的精神文明却好似他。醫學也是如此；有許多人明知西醫比中醫好，可是依然不肯認輸說：﹁西醫注重實質的研究，中醫注重精神的觀察，外科方面西醫固然比中醫好，内科却遠不如中醫。﹂這是第一點。第二，吾們國民的性質，是保守的，復舊的，開化以來的現象，到了現在還是那個現象。醫學當然也不能例外；數千年前的岐黄醫學，到現在所盛行的還是岐黄醫學。西洋的醫學如何的改進和發達，絶未注意到，只要保守我們的固有醫學，便算完了責任。近來以保守國粹（？）爲號召的中醫，能使斜陽衰草的吾國醫學，得到一部份人的鼓吹贊同，便因爲他們的說數，合着吾們國民特有的保守復舊的心理。西醫不能普及，這也是一種絶大的阻力。這是第二點。第三，中醫在社會裏旣有這許多年的歷史，一般社會關於中醫方面的醫藥名詞，也大體知道一點；譬如當吾們問病的時候，他們不說我的肝火太旺，便說我的腎水大虧。還有什麽血熱陰寒的玄之又玄的名詞，連篇不停的說出來。這種情形，凡是已經掛牌的新醫，總不免碰到的；如果告訴他的病是胃炎或神經衰弱，他們一定不相信。至於藥品方面，中醫所開方子的藥，有許多他們約略知道牠的效用；而新醫方面，除了自來血人丹幾種常見的廣告藥外，一般社會没有一點兒智識；他們對新醫旣抱了懷疑的態度，同時又呌他吃他們莫明其妙的藥，這又怎能引起他們信仰呢？這是第三點。第四，是西藥的價格太高，一方面因爲有許多西藥，中國還不能自製，都從外洋運來，價格自然較貴；一方面新醫中有許多敗類也欺人太甚，他知道社會上不知西藥的價錢，有時便任意的敲竹槓，這還是藥的一方面，至於診費，通都大邑的中西醫，固然差不多，可是小城市的</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>新醫，出診的價目，比之中醫，往往高出數倍以上，怎麽不令人望而却步呢？　　處在二十世紀的時代，受新潮流鼓蕩而來的人們，須要抱着改革時代的宗旨。人類從野蠻時代進化到文明時代，便是不斷改革的效果；如果只要守着舊的現象，現在還不是仍然是一個野蠻時代？所以我對於陳陳相因不知改進的中醫，是極端的反對，可是有什麽方法使具着改進精神適應潮流的新醫，逐漸地普及到社會上呢？第一，我希望我國應有自製的藥品，不查靠外國的供給；一方面可補很大的漏巵；一方面價格可以低廉，使一般平民不會因爲藥貴而不敢來請敎。第二，政府對於中醫要嚴格登記；至於執古方以殺人的學究派，及信口胡謅的江湖派；還有非驢非馬的藥店夥友派；均當嚴厲取締。第三，多設平民醫院，使一般民衆都得着就診的機會　　末了，還有一句話要敬告一切的新醫，如果要科學的新醫普及到社會上；第一要負起改革醫學的責任，從黑暗的途裏，一步一步的前進，努力驅除了一切的障碍。第二要尊重醫生固有的道德，引起一般社會的信仰。第三要切實與民衆結合，使新醫成爲大衆的醫學。</p>

<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>（丙）分娩時應有之常識及要點</p>
<p>（一）開始陣痛後之大小便</p>
<p>陣痛反覆發作，即在分娩開始的當兒，無論有否排便，必須先行灌腸，並應時時排尿，</p>
<p>因排便時的用力，倘有破胞之虞，應取偏形便器，可在床上行之，分娩初期的小便，可任産婦之意，不妨如厠，倘子宫口已經開放到三生的米達時，應令取仰臥位排出，如因小便困難，可用通尿管·</p>
<p>大小便爲什麽要如此的注意？因爲大小便潴積，容易誘起陣痛微弱症，以致阻碍分娩的進程，所以不可疎忽。</p>
<p>（二）起臥行動</p>
<p>陣痛尚未强劇時，産婦的起臥行動，可以任意爲之，初産婦更不妨在室内散步。</p>
<p>倘子宫口已開大有三生的米達時，必須令其就臥，因在此時起坐，恐有胞水早破：上肢或臍帶脫出之慮。</p>
<p>經産婦在昔如有分娩經過急速，或是懸埀，或有出血的習慣，那末；在分娩開始的當口，即須令其仰臥，以防不測。</p>
<p>年輕婦人，在初次分娩，或是性急的經産婦，倘使不能禁其危懼心，以致恐怖暴懆，異常不安，那末；應該從旁勸慰，極力解釋，可說；生産爲自然的生理的機轉，本無危險，大可安心，切弗憂慮，假使恐懼不寗，那倒反而危險了。</p>
<p>有時在開口期陣痛逐漸微弱，或竟完全休止的時候，産婦要想睡眠，倘無其他顧慮，不妨聽其安睡，以便休息，等待一度睡醒後，可以恢復精神，增添氣力，然後再起强烈的陣痛。</p>
<p>（三）用力過早</p>
<p>産婦往往有在開口時期，即用腹壓，此事非但有害無益，而且易使産婦疲乏，並易引起陣痛微弱，亦有因此發生早期破水，或痙攣性陣痛，於是分娩經過延遲，疼痛反而增劇，所以分娩之初，嚴禁早期用力（腹壓）。</p>
<p>（四）飲食</p>
<p>産婦因爲陣痛，往往不思飲食，但其中希望飲食者，亦不乏人，倘預測其分娩經過，或須延長的話，不妨給與少許的飲食，切忌過多，例如：稀粥藕粉鷄蛋牛乳湯汁麵包等類，飲料用淸茶淸水，切忌濃茶咖啡及酒類，倘在疲乏時，可用少許葡萄酒。</p>
<h3 id="c205">乳房的美學和科學保護法（下） <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>乳束是保護形態美</p>
<p>在保護乳房的位置，形狀之各種方法中，最必要的，是採用適合於自己的乳束。乳束，在西洋方面，雖然有現成發賣的，但因爲都是同一式樣，當然没有一切人都平貼合用的道理。不平貼適合的乳束，是不中用的。乳束，一面不使衣服摩擦和剌激乳房：一面使乳房固定在胸前，即在身子活動的時候，也不會發生不必要而不愉快的動搖：尤其是可以防止下埀。在徐步時，快走時，跳躍時，屈身時，若乳房跟着動搖，這不但不雅觀，而且扯動乳房的附着組織，要覺得痛的。</p>
<p>那種式樣的乳束是適當</p>
<p>要保護美的乳房；要遮掩已下埀的乳房，不使出醜，和更加下埀；那末合身的乳束，寶是必要。乳束是用堅牢粗鬆而有彈性的布片做成，下緣，是用橡皮鑲着，使呼吸和上肢運動不致感到困難。搭掛在肩上的紐帶，不要太狹，免得嵌入肉中。因行經時，乳房要脹些的，所以要做成可以收放，以資調節。</p>
<p>Ｃorst和Ｃorslet</p>
<p>肥滿的埀乳房，用普通乳束，是不相宜的。把重重的乳房，壓在胸口：使呼吸困難；而且紐帶又要嵌進肩頭；所以反而有害。必須用Corset（肚束）從下方支持着才好。可是舊式的Corset，要擠高乳房，更加使醜態外　，是不能用的：最好用近時的Corslet（較長的背心），把胸部腹部一齊裏緊。</p>
<p>埀乳房的弊害</p>
<p>十分下埀的乳房，不但不雅觀，和工作時的不便，在健康上也有妨害。肥胖的婦人，因這種多脂的乳房，身體更加增重，運動不自由，而且壓迫胸廓：妨害呼吸；有害心臟的活動，造成腰痛的原因；乳房下易生濕疹而潰爛。</p>
<p>割乳的歷史</p>
<p>割乳，在太古時代，是對女性所施的刑罰。在紀元前二千二百五十年，巴比倫王哈馬拉比的法律書第一百九十四章中，也可明白看出。女戰士常常爲了要使右臂的活動自由，尤其是便於投石，在幼年時代就割去右乳。又有爲了想適於武裝，在孩子時代就把兩乳灼傷。有些宗派，爲了想不要由乳房來散佈性的剌激，所以割去侍奉神的女子的乳房</p>
<p>乳房美的造成和近代醫術</p>
<p>一部分爲了想增加自己肉體美的近代婦人，熱烈地要求着割乳；而且一九三二年的流行型，是細身苗條爲貴，所以出賣肉體美的婦人；在職業上感到大乳房不便的婦人；直連到不願落後的有閑階級婦人；都託辭於有礙健康，求施行整形手術，於是醫師的解剖刀，便放在乳房上了，近代醫術高明，可以不割乳　，一面保持他的機能，一面割去過剩的脂肪，和延弛的皮膚，改成適當的位置，美麗匀整的形狀。乳頭凹陷的，不但形式不美觀，而且哺乳也困難，所以現在有使乳頭凸出的整形手術。</p>

<h3 id="c206">新醫藥發達過程中幾個重要的發見和發明（三） <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 顧壽白</p>
<p>除了全身麻醉劑，其餘的就要算局部麻痺劑了。</p>
<p>局部麻痺劑也有兩種，第一種是凍冷劑。因爲身體的一部分凍冷了就可完全失去知覺。這凍冷法是一八四八年阿諾脫（J·Arnott）氏所始創的。當時他所用的只是冰和雪的合劑。這種合劑雖亦可用，但未必都能奏效。到了一八六六年，利查孫（SirBenjamjnWardRichardson）氏又發明了一種更便利的方法。他用特種的噴霧器，能將極純的醇精向局部噴成細霧。這時醇精蒸發極速，就由這一局部奪取了許多温熱，而使皮膚凍冷，變爲白色而硬化起來。這凍冷法至今還是用着。但是現在因爲ethylchloride能使組織更快凍冷，所以常用以代替醇精。</p>
<p>另外一種局部麻痺法，就是用某種藥物使局部神經麻痺的方法。﹁可卡因﹂（Cocaine）是這類藥物中最初的一種，在一八八四年纔爲醫界所採用。近年以來，還有許多改良的製劑，如﹁諾伏卡因﹂（Ｎovocaine）﹁優卡因﹂（Eucaine）之類，比﹁可卡因﹂效力更大，用途更廣。將這些藥物製成適當濃的溶液，注射於皮内，經過二三分時，這一局部就可失去知覺。這些藥物，應用於口腔，咽喉和鼻腔的粘膜以及眼内的時候，只要塗在表面，不必注射，已有麻痺知覺的作用。</p>
<p>近來還有一種腰椎麻痺法，只要將﹁可卡因﹂等類麻痺藥的溶液注入腰椎管内的脊髓膜下，便能使身體下半部的神經完全失去知覺。這時病人雖是醒着，郤絲毫不覺得手術的痛苦。例如割除痔核，近來就多半採用這種腰椎麻痺法。　　還有直腸内麻醉法也是近年纔試騐成功的。從前雖有人用液狀或汽狀的醇精注入直腸内，試行全身麻醉，結果都歸失敗。到了一九二六年布成蓋格（Butzengeiger）氏纔用﹁阿勿汀﹂（Avertin）行直腸麻醉法，次年將成績詳細發表出來，其後德國外科醫家採用這法施行手術的很多。這直腸麻醉法對於頭部頸部上尤其盾狀腺腫，巴塞多（Basedow）氏病的手術和胸郭，脊柱的手術都可用得；可是對於内臟的外科手術應用這種麻醉法，似乎還有許多異議。</p>
<p>（二）防腐滅菌法</p>
<p>十九世紀中外科學長足進步的主要原因，除了發明麻醉劑的用法外，還與發明了防腐滅菌法很有關係。</p>
<p>以前對於創傷的化膿都認爲是和腐敗空氣與創口接觸的結果，後來纔知道這種觀察的錯誤，由實騐上證明空氣中有病菌存在，使大衆知道空氣本身並不是化膿的原因，於是引起了外科學上的一太革新，這不能不說是李士脫（ＪosephLister）的功績。現在且將李氏發明防腐法的經過情形略記如下。</p>
<p>李士脫的父親雖是倫敦的酒商，但是對於製造光學器械很有趣味，後來居然發明了無色鏡片，對於近世科學研究上成爲絶大的貢獻。到了李氏本身，他對於巴士特（Ｐasteur）氏所主張﹁空氣中有微生物存在，可爲種種疾病的原因，並且敗血症和膿毒症也是由此而起﹂的學說，十分注意，於是就想到若能發明一種殺滅這些病原微生物的方法，應該就可防止這些疾病，此後他就在雜誌上發表了關於巴氏微生物說的文章。</p>
<p>但是李氏郤想用化學的方法來殺滅病菌，這和巴氏加熱滅菌的方法不相同。當李氏在格拉斯哥（Glasgow）病院中繼續研究的時候，病人因敗血症·膿毒症·丹毒·破傷風·壞疽等病而死亡的很多，因截斷肢體而致命的也在百分之四十五以上。一八六五年的時候，正好卡利斯爾（Carlisle）市的勒麥爾（Lemaire）氏曾用石炭酸施行下水的消毒。李氏聽見這個消息，也就把石炭酸應用於外科方面，積了兩年的經騐，然後纔把成績公表出來。他應用石炭酸消毒法所施行的手術，有脊髓和關節的膿瘍，膝關節的鋸斷，胸部的手術，膝蓋骨骨折等。</p>
<p>當時醫界對於李氏所主張的防腐法的效果不肯置信，甚至直接反對的人很是不少。對於巴士特氏學說反對最烈的李比希（VonLiebig）和赫姆呵兹（Helmholtz）氏等都說：微生物只是偶然共同存在，並非醱酵和腐敗的原因，而創傷的化膿也不是微菌所惹起，乃是一部分由體内一部分由綳帶材料而來的酵素的作用。他們對於巴氏學說的態度尚且如此，所以對於和巴氏學說有密切關係的李氏防腐處置當然更不相信。就是李氏友人愛丁堡地方的辛博森Simpson）氏也站在反對的地位。還有斯噴斯（Spence）氏說石炭酸除了對於創傷有强烈的剌戟外，在創傷的經過上也與從來的治療法毫無不同。這樣一直到了一八七二年，外科方面採用李氏防腐法的，在英國也不過利物浦（Liverpool），滿即斯脫（Manchester）幾處，至於倫敦方面，簡直不知道有這麽一回事。這樣看來，當時醫家對於李氏防腐法其態度的冷淡也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>李氏爲解除誤會起見，時常在雜誌和公衆會議席上發表他的學說和實騐，其後要想完全防止創傷的傳染，更加銳意研究，結果在一八七一年又發表了石炭酸噴霧器和應用石炭酸的防腐綳帶。當時李氏的思想乃是以巴士特氏的實騐爲根據；他以爲空氣中含有病菌　所以就以這空中的病菌爲戰鬭的對象。由現在看起來，防腐殺菌的主要目的，與其說在殺滅空氣中所含的病菌，無寗還是注重在如何撲滅施術者的手指，外科器械和創傷附近皮面所附着的病菌；可是當時李氏的根本思想以爲但能殺滅由外部侵入創傷的病菌，就可豫防化膿傳染。這種方針，就在現代也還是不變的啊！</p>
<p>德國當一八七○至一八七一年間普法戰爭的時候，軍隊中曾經採用過防腐處置，到了一八七二年，德國駐愛丁堡的軍醫須爾策（Schultze）氏關於李氏的防腐法曾在德國軍醫雜誌中發表了許多文章；於是大家對於李氏的創傷處置法頗覺引起注意。其後又有許多醫家加以詳細實騐，確認其爲有效。等到一八七七至一八七八年，德國科和（Koch）氏發見了化膿菌並知道這菌的性質的時候，李氏的防腐法纔一變而爲現今的無菌法。其後一八八六年又有蒸氣消毒法代替昇液的消毒，到了一八九一年，那無菌法就被實際應用起來了。</p>
<p>（三）顯微鏡的發明</p>
<p>十七世紀初葉的時候，有了顯微鏡的發明，竟使肉眼所不能見的世界也能瞭如指掌，在學術上可謂别開生面。這正和望遠鏡的發明促進天文學的進步同樣重要。</p>

<p>但，一般吟朋對於桃花的歌詠，縳脫不了歷來詩閔的兩種傳統思想：一，是嗟歎它的命運，什麽﹁桃花命薄隨流水﹂的感想，搖筆卽來；二，是譏笑它的品格，什麽﹁輕薄桃花　水流﹂的感想，也是搖　卽來。還有什麽附庸風雅的西溪叢話，把桃花做比妖客；什麽推詳八字的盲子先生，說人家交到了桃花運，便不免有種種色情狂的危險。</p>
<p>花開花謝，是花叢中一定的過程；倘把風雨交加之下的落紅片片，　做桃花命薄的象微；那麽，梅花杏花等類無一不是命薄的了，爲什麽只說桃花命薄呢？不經落紅片片，怎會結實纍纍；你們往後睢吧，一到了夏秋之交什麽蟠桃玉桃水蜜桃，又要引起社會的熱戀而津津不忍去口；試問梅花杏花會得産出這般甘美的結晶品肥潤的寗馨兒麽？桃花的命運，勝過了梅花杏花；它旣不是命薄，那麽逐水而流，更不是它的輕薄象徵了。西溪叢話以桃花爲妖客，尤其是胡說，眞呌做妖者見之謂之妖了。盲子先生口中的桃花運，是人家不願接受的；其實，交了桃花運也未當不可，徧留佳種在人間，有什麽不好呢？</p>

<p>第四回情局復開茶寮傾積愫年關難渡質庫作哀鳴</p>
<p>桂枝道：一個月總　個百兒八十的吧？江氏道：一個人有這些個錢，就夠養家眷的了。桂枝還是没有作聲。江氏道：老太爺上次說過，要和趙連長找家眷了，就是人才不容易選中，其實······伊說到這個地方，猶豫了一會子，又繼續的道：一個當連長的人，年歲不大，脾氣又挺好，再說家裏又没有什麽人，這樣的親事，還有什麽人不願意的呢？桂枝將衣服環抱到懷裏，揉成了個布團，走下地來，將爐子上熱的開水，冲了一杯熱茶喝，將桌子上的東西，這樣看看，那樣摸摸，約莫有五六分鐘之久，這才重復回到坑上去作活。江氏看姑娘這個樣子，似乎是不願意聽這種話，然而也就不敢决定也是不願意聽這種話，過了一會子，他又緩緩的笑起來道：趙連長這種人，無論在那一方面看去，也是二個好人，你覺得怎麽樣呢？江氏因爲摸不着姑娘對趙自强的態度如何，所以索興敞開來問姑娘一句。桂枝覺得就趙自强爲人而論，實在也說不出他什麽壞處來，母親吃了人家的熟牛肉，要恭維人家幾句，自己實在也就無話可說。因淡淡的答道：總算不壞的。江氏一想，姑娘自然是不便直接的說人家好，總算不壞這四個字，這就形容得姑娘要說好又不好意思說好的態度出來了。停了一停，微笑道：我的意思，倒想和他作個媒。桂枝在今天晚上，看母親的態度，聽母親的話意，知道是必有所謂，心裏想着，不睬母親也就算了。如今母親單刀直入的說起要作媒來，這倒讓伊窮於應付。要否認呢？母親說的是作媒，又不是說的許親，自己表示着不願意的話，倒顯看自已多心。要不否認呢？在反面看起來，就算是承認了，那如何使得。態度很難表示，又不能不表示，這倒很苦痛，因爲痛苦所以默想了許久，說不出話。（三七）</p>
<p>把臉凑上伊的　子，聞那香氣，而且挨身上去，涎臉笑道；﹁好姐姐，把你嘴上的胭脂，賞給我吃了吧，﹂一面便扭股糖似的黏在身上。這是多麽香艶，但又多麽肉麻的韵事　實則比了現在銀幕上公開接吻表情，又有什麽可非難哩。</p>

<p>天剛才發白，鷄兒還没有唱出催人起床的短曲，賣菜翁已戴着殘月，脚踏在露珠的田野中，很勤謹地掘着靑菜，裝入擔子裏。</p>
<p>他雖滿頭披着白髮，額上深刻着縐紋；但是他並没有露出一點衰老的現象，也仍滿腔飛躍着靑春的活力。他做了一會工作，覺得身上有些發燒了，便把夾衣也脫了下來；那時被汗所潮潤的額角，巳在發亮了。</p>
<p>他肩着滿擔的蔬菜，譽起靑筋飽脹的脚，急促地趕到市塲上去；心中暗自思量着：米窠裏的米巳經不多了：昨天隔壁隣家送來了一籃的靑　子，少不得也要送一些回敬的禮物；天氣熱了，阿狗要添一二件布糙的衣服······繼又想到時常買他蔬菜的那位黄太太，人也很和善，今天看見了，向伊討幾雙破鞋子，帶面前一位手裏執着一束西報的西裝少年見了，急忙站起身來，騰出他那原有的座位，同時，伸出他那空閒的手，向女郎舒掌一揚，手指觸着女郎的衣服，順便略移視線，向那因爲誤會而搶上一步的老太婆瞅了一眼，女郎剛坐下半個屁股，似乎有所發現，立又站起身雙手扶那老太婆端正坐下後，自己伸着玉臂，拉了藤圈，把背向少年站在人叢中······這是我在寫這篇稿子前的二十分鐘在三路電車中所見的一幕。</p>

<p>— 鵑雲</p>
<p>提起了﹁吳娃﹂兩個字，全中國人都公認蘇州是美人出産地。似乎多愁善病，捧心西施，是蘇州婦女們的通病。而且在北幾省的人，更認爲當破女的一切南邊姑娘都是蘇州人。無怪乎民十四奉軍南下，駐紮在蘇州時，凡見了穿旗袍在街上走的婦女，便喚伊一聲花姑娘。</p>
<p>其實這種觀念完全是錯誤的，因爲在墮落的社會中，幾幾乎没有一埠没有妓女，可是認爲南邊妓女都是蘇州人的，更來得荒謬絶倫。往往在一般冶遊客誤認妓女都是蘇州人，妓女自己却也都冒認是蘇州人。有﹂回有一個寗波籍的妓女，人家問伊是那裏人？伊却說：﹁阿拉是蘇州人。﹂諸如此類的笑話很多很多，却始，終減不了人們對於蘇州婦女的汚衊心理！</p>
<p>我以爲蘇州婦女對於時代女性需要上，確處處能開風氣之先，差不多在内地各縣，女孩子纒足的，到現在還不少見，尤其是在那些﹁窮鄉僻壤﹂似乎蘇州已找不到這類怪現狀，蘇州鄉間的婦女更絶對不纒足，這種風氣也不自現在始，一向在全國婦女都厲行着纒足的時代，蘇州鄉婦却始終是赤着一雙脚。</p>
<p>荷鋤耕地，入山採樵，婦女也和男子一般地勞苦工作。或者我們到鄧尉天平山去游玩過的，也曾見過往來　走，抬着山轎的許多鄉婦，步履矯健，精神煥發，蘇州婦女並不示弱吧！　　在城市間除了一部份重門深閨的千金之軀，蘇州女子絶不似人家那般羞澀畏縮。自然在十九世紀人的眼光看來，女子們在街市上走是認爲輕佻的</p>
<p>我們再看蘇州的街頭巷尾，無論是什麽店舗丨雜貨店，點心舗丨櫃檯裏端坐着一兩個婦女，也有一些是掌櫃的閨女，此外大部份的人家都尊稱一聲老　娘。自然這類婦女的生活，不能說是澈底的婦女職業生活，大槪也能算是婦女職業的先聲吧？</p>
<p>大部份蘇州婦女，尤其是一般小家碧玉，大都能够操勞克苦，做一份應盡的女職，那們蘇州的婦女，在時代中並不算落伍吧。</p>

<h3 id="c215">資本主義的將來謝菊曾 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>爲什麽　過去數百年中，辛苦建築的資本主義，到了今日，完全崩潰？究竟我們的産銷制度失散在什麽地方。能弊把緊榮恢復嗎？如果可以的話，又用什麽方法來恢復呢？</p>
<p>全世界的商業領袖們，站在這些基本問題之前，正是束手無策。他們一再掮出﹁金本位﹂，﹁關稅壁壘﹂，﹁賠欵﹂，﹁物價平準﹂，或其他類似的﹂種託詞來，用以表示他們的缺乏協議行勲。他們環起無援的雙手，　向政府求助；同時世界上的商業；都陷於七顛八倒，害得大多數人士啼飢號寒，而其餘人士的生活，也時時給不安定與不鞏固的環境繞纏着。</p>
<p>於是，在這個人類歷史上不景氣時代的各國政府，對此又是那麽辦呢？一般政治家，川流不息地忙着會議，以求丨不是整個人類的幸福丨他們所代表的一部分人士的利益。你看英國政府已把她被人讚美多時的自由貿易政策，抛在一旁，開始建築關稅壁壘了。但是，依舊不能使她避免憂鬱的負詹。在美國，關稅壁壘的後面，掘着很長的戰壕，結果還勞大總統用武力騙逐飢餓的退伍兵士，麟開京都，最後還勞新總統施行緊急金融法令，宣佈銀行休假，勉强將銀行風潮的難關渡過；而前途的暗礁正多。再看日本，一方面積極對我國侵略，一方面國内兒童因爲没有飯吃餓死的，以及被　作奴隷倡妓比死更不如的，正不知有多少。</p>
<p>處處地方，國王換總統，總統换迭克推多；一個政體接着又是一個政體，但是換湯不換藥，結果百姓依舊是餓死。</p>
<p>當後世的史　家叙述到這一個人類没出息的特殊時期，他們對於這個混亂狀態下所致的一切惡果，究將歸咎那一種人民呢？這眞是一個本趣的問題。政治家嗎？商業領袖嗎？要之無論如何，要　載這一時期　的商業領袖們的舉止，確是不容易着筆。他們容許資本主義的大馬車，沿着懸　絶壁向山下奔馳，駕御的人。丨羣衆丨没有强固團結的氣力，來控制精醫，好使車子安穏地前進，却聽任他們的乘客，丨政治家丨爭自拉着　繩，而又南轅北轍，各不相謀，如此而欲求大馬車的不顛於山脚下，又如何可得呢！於是整個商業裏若干部分的領袖，便設法將搖　不定的客車，用身體來加以糾正；一面再在一個車輪下面墊一塊石子。但是這個來勢實在太猛了，終於横衝直撞，肇下大禍爲止。</p>
<p>是不是我們對於舉世實業界的領袖們有微詞？議我們再　别個問題，好生地來解答一下。假定在他們控制下的商業單位之一，發生了紊亂，如此他們預備那樣去幹呢？這個回答，很是簡輩：他們着手改組，那個單位，他們很敏捷很有力地幹去，務使那個單位立刻能和其餘的一切調和，决不讓它長時間的紊亂，也决不讓那個單位的領袖作永久的戀棧。但是，如果在他們控制下的一應商業單位，都捲入紊亂的漩渦中，那末他們究竟那樣地去幹呢？假使他們不願更動那些領袖們，結果他們是否能够戰勝一切困難以及勇猛地改組整個的事業，好使工作恢復原有的順利及調和，却是有些疑問。這事若遭遇的僅僅是個單位，或是任何今日世界的商業領袖們個人控制的一種實業，或幾個單位，那是當然不成問題。儘有不少的案件，業經證實處理圓滿。但是一等到這個混亂紛擾的局面，蔓延到全世界全部實業的時候，要想憑藉個人的努力來救濟，那就做不到了。那末，我們的領袖們，究竟幹的什麽呢？只要一檢世界失業的統計，便是這個問題的答案。然而依然是處在我們的資本主義之下，還逃不了全世界實業的里必丹們的掌握。他們是控制世界的整個繁榮的：</p>
<p>不論那一種的資本主義的企業，丨除了俄國丨都各自控制着世界的原料。他們控制了工廠，將這些原料變成有用的貨物。同時世界的運輸　業，除了不足道的少數特例外，都是組織在資本主義的陣線上，推而至於世界的金融組　及銀行制度，莫不绵皆然。他們不但控制一切的東西，而且又控制勞工的待過。總之，繁榮世界所必需的一應事情，都歸他們掌握。惟其如此，在今日悲觀的混亂局面之下，爭來咀咒他們，得毋不近大情？其實不然，正因一切事情都在他們的掌握，當他們能够處理這個世界的狂潮之前，更應那樣格外賣力呢！洞悉此次困難的　結，以及抱定充分的勇氣和大膽，來解决這個問題，便是他們的義務。</p>
<p>舉簡單的幾個例來說，在歐戰以前八九十年，英國竟可以說是將製造品供給全世界，以之交換原料，於是英國以及她的實業，便從這椿賣買上面，建立下一個富庶的基業。在這個時期之中，英國和其餘各國間乃是一種極簡單的貨物交換狀態，但是因爲英國機器的出口日益增加，各國開始偷襲地的方法，因此世界貿易情形，漸漸地趨於複雜。其餘民族，躱在關稅壁壘之後，開始把他們的原料變成機製品，最初僅供自已的百姓消費，到了後來，因爲生産增加，便向他們所能輪出而又可以獲利的任何國家銷售。</p>
<p>在美國，這　尤其來得顯者，她拚命地生産各種的機製品，因此創造出來的新實業領袖們，便開始尋覓市塲。只是尋來尋去，竟找不到一處不曾給他國商人盤據的市塲，於是惟一的出路，只有借重廉價貨物之一法，而國際間便開始作劇烈的競爭，因此播下了大亂的種子。　　差不多每一個國家都成爲實業化了。全世界主要各國的新工廠，都開始生産貨物。這　成爲各國政府的主要目標，所以着手加以規畫。凡是在自己國境内製造的貨物，都可以輸出國外，盡量售與各國；同時却不許别國的貨物來到自己的國境内銷售。各國政府根據了道個政策，於是便築起或拉倒關稅壁　，或築之使高，或削之使低，結果無非以世界上其餘部分入民的血汗，供作一部分人民富曉的代價。到了後來，這種紊亂的情勢，一日顯似一日，於是歐洲大戰便隨之爆發。繼之世界使立刻轉到大戰前八九十年的最初五十年的簡單貿易方式。英國和大多數的歐洲諸國，爭把製造廠改製軍用品。國際間的貿易競爭，就此停止。而不曾捲入戰爭渦漢的國家，乃得趁機銷售，差不多一切東西，他們的工廠那能生産。至於從事戰爭諸國工廠的産品，却都消費於大破壞中。</p>
<p>最後大戰結束，那些未受戰事影　的國家，在後此數年中，忙着供給貨物，來修補荒墟。同時交戰國也開始改組他們的工廠，着手製造和平時期的通常貨物。因此逐步的恢復大戰以前世界貿易所處的同樣地位，一而却又加上了複什的國際債務的困難，以及全世界非常複什的財政問題，但這不過戰爭給予人類的可怖的遺贈之一罷了。</p>
<p>無論何人，凡是游歷過世界各處的，當能明白世界上的工廠所有生産的貨物，並未超過人類的消費量以外。例如中國，四百五十兆的人民，其中大多數均是貧窮到極點，對於許多貨物，不要說消費，連見也没有瞧見過。而印度大部分的人民一身所有，除掉包頭的一塊布，及飯碗裏的幾粒米以外，竟找不出别的東西。卽就眼前歐美兩洲而論，千百萬的人士，所具備的東西，都不克達到西方文明的尋常標準點，致令大家感覺有考慮减少安樂的必要。所以這是很明顯的，世界上工廠的生産，還遠不足適應人類安樂和幸福的需要。換句話說，今日的生産，還依舊遠在世界人口消費限度之下。這是眞的，世界各地的倉庫裏，都堆滿着貨物，而農夫儘多不願虧本出售，往往摧毁他們的收穫。但是這些情形，與其說是生産過剩的表示，毋寗自爲資本主義的分配制度崩潰的結果。從這裏面可以看出資本主義建設了它的制度以後，要想着手第二步保留業經適應的種種利益，竟是不够資格。而這第二步應採的手續，顯然是須把全世界加以通盤的組織。</p>
<p>業經有不少文章討論這個問題，也經隨時隨地提議過許多改組的計畫。但是絶少能見諸實行的。不相信人類竟坐視文明的毁減，不肯出死力去把它保留。我們單只瞧俄國，看看有什麽方法可以應用偉大的試騐。至於這個試騐是成功或失敗，却不是我們的目標所在；我們的目標，乃是資本主義的前線，仍放着兩條道路，一條是改組它的來源，重新領導世界到繁榮之路：别一條是就人類需要的生産和分配，改用幾種新的偉大試騐，拿整個的世界來講，人們是否眞正歡迎嘗試一下新試騐，尚是一個疑問；而由資本主義的企業領袖們，根據較妥較善的基礎，在改組上用功夫，却爲大多數人民所歡迎。就實際言，這樣的改組，並非不可能。第一步是需要每一實業國裏的每一實業，須有一種組織，如此每國每一實業，都有它管理的機關。將較小及比較不甚重要的那些實業，划分幾部，置於同樣的管理之下，一面又把銀行財政以及有組織的勞工，同樣地分閂别　和同樣地管理。</p>
<p>就這種種管理機關的領商們裏，不妨再選出代表，組織一個最高議會。有一這個議會，和代表，便可以把全國的貿易集而爲一，進而與政府合作，設法終止這個政令紛歧的局面，同時又改變關稅政策，因爲這個政策，前後己不知摧毁了世界多少商業！</p>
<p>在有等國家，現時所行的法律，對於上項辦法的實業組織，未免要加以禁止。但是法律可以變更的，資本主義的勢力，聯合了那些有組織的勞工的努力合作，不難變換法典上的任何法律。</p>
<p>一俟各國的實業，都依照上項辦法組織完備之後，便可以締造一個﹁世界實業聯盟﹂。這非現下一些没有管理權力的國際聯盟可比。它確能控制世界貿易，它有過制戰爭的力量，不單只限於勸導爲止，更能阻止世界的産品，供這種瘋狂目的的利用。</p>
<p>全世界的勞動時間，經由﹁世界實業聯盟﹂的規定，就可以進而謀世界物價的安定。如此眼前最大的問題之一，便無形消滅了。世界實業領袖們經由道般的一個聯盟的結合，互相努力合作，那麽它的改組計畫，也許爲中國人士所歡迎，藉此提高四百五十兆人民的購買力，一面替世界增加貨物的消費量，雙方都有好處。這顯然與列强的帝國主義政策有别；帝國主義政策是不爲中國政府及人民歡迎的，但是一世界實業聯盟﹂，是没有帝國主義色彩的，當然易於收效。比起外國政府的揷身干涉，結果徒然擴大糾紛，自然不可同日而語了。</p>
<p>上面所說的中國，僅不過是一個例證，目下世界正有許多這類的問題，急待解决。而今日對於資本主義所欲討論的，就是是否創造一種眼前所缺乏的世界的控制機械，用以解决這些問題呢，還是繳還它的權力於新的組織計盡？資本主義領袖們當能好生記住，例如共産黨便是按照能控制它在全世界各處行動制度組織的人類愈進步，世界愈文明，資本主義只能像大發　般的繼續前進，假便它的領袖們，對於他們在全世界所産生的現狀，準備加以組織的話。有了﹁世界實業聯盟﹂這一種關體，就可以使世界的財政·金融·和有組織的勞工領袖及實業界代表們，薈萃一堂，共同討論。而人類的文明乃得日進於無疆之域，同時戰爭的遏滅，也遠較政治家更快速而更有力。它如全世界工作時間，經成立協定，於是人類的安逸和修養，便自然地因之增加。而目下世界商業上的許多病症，不難憑　這般的一個組織，而獲得妙手回春。倘使資本主義的領袖們，仍舊繼續着自私自利的政策，不肯放大眼光，從遠處着想，則資本主義的被共産主義取之而代恐怕爲期就不在遠啊！</p>
<h3 id="c216">馬立斯制銀行及其實况王雨桐 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>曩昔時事新報之﹁銀行與信託﹂週刊。曾出馬立斯制銀行專號。不侫於﹁馬立斯制銀行與平民金融之關係﹂一文中。再三申述其爲最適要於我國現時平民經濟之金融制度。蓋在今日之資本主義組織的社會。金融機關。素奉實物担保主義爲原則。銀行之放欵業務。胥視担保品之有無及確實與否爲通則。而担保品之主要者。如各種有價證劵。及不動産商品等類。　近年來以經濟界之不振。各種證劵及不動産之市價逐落。每易突破担保品價格。於是銀行不得不速謀收回債權。或要求增加担保品。致令借欵人更處於困難地位。故馬立斯制度乃捨實物担保主義。而以個人信用爲基礎。完全以小工商業及薪水階級爲對象。此制創於美人阿薩馬立　氏。迄今以其人名冠之。遂稱爲馬立斯制。馬氏於一九一零年。任銀行之法律顧問時。屢有關於小額放欵之問題。就氏商决。馬氏一方復鑒於國内高利貸之盛行。人民深爲所苦。遂擬研究一種新方案。獎勵下層階級之節約。及給予工資勞動者小工商業者以信用借欵之便宜。終之馬氏所研究之基礎原理。（一）以人格與所得力。爲給予信用之適當根據。（二）根據上項原則。所貸給之欵項。可依借欵入之所得力。定一較長之償還時期。（三）此類借欵。須以用於生利事業者爲限。故此項制度之原則。係合人格與所得力。作爲最良之保證也。</p>
<p>至馬立斯制銀行之籌措放欵資金方法。係發行三種證劵。作爲流通資金。卽（一）Ａ種證劵。丨丨爲一種單純之股票式證劵。發售於一般願投資而以營利爲目的者。（二）Ｂ種證劵丨丨爲給利（普通爲五厘）之投資證劵。有類銀行之定期存欵。此項證劵。可分期繳欵。（三）Ｃ種證劵丨丨專用以推銷於向銀行借欵之借欵人。亦爲分期繳欵（一年繳淸）之投資證劵。惟無利息。</p>
<p>馬立斯制銀行之借欵方法。借欵人應先得銀行之放欵委員會承認後。銀行即以Ｃ種證劵令其承購。然後借欵人即以之抵押於銀行。同時由借欵人出立一年期之允付期票。交於銀行。其金額與所購之Ｃ種證劵同。俾證劵之數額繳淸。借欵亦可同時償淸。普通Ｃ種證劵分五十次繳欵。每星期繳欵一次。一年内繳淸。欵項繳淸之日。即爲借欵償完之時也。</p>
<p>馬立斯制在遠東各國中最爲盛行者。首推日本。東京大阪神户各都市中。均有此類機關。其最著者爲日本商工助成會社，昭和馬立斯商工會社。大阪馬立斯商工會社等。日本之馬立</p>
<p>斯制金融制度。仍以無担保品主義之對人信用爲原則。全以借欵人之信用，人格，及其素性，爲取决之重要點。日本當計畫施行之初。亦擬以薪水階級及中小工商業者爲對象。但因日本之情形與美國不同。一般薪水階级皆未能加以充分利用。因之其發展中心點。勢必漸趨集於中小工商業者。故其業務機關之名稱。多有冠以商工等之樣。至馬立斯制之經營主體。在美國已被認爲馬立斯式銀行之一種正式銀行業。但在日本。凡非屬銀行法上所規定之金融機關。不得稱爲銀行。故日本之馬立斯制金融機關。恒與普通之銀行成爲分道而馳之機關。換言之。即銀行於本身組織之外。另組一經營機關。辦理馬立斯制之金融業務。更設一控轄機關。丨ＨoldiogＣompany以處理之。蓋前者爲行政機關。後者爲立法機關也。</p>
<p>日本之銀行。對於馬立斯制金融機關之增資及繳股等事務。復爲商法之規定所限。不能自行直接辦理。均由另設之控轄機關全部担任辦理。而掌管已繳足之股票。至經營機關。則專營借欵之業務。即借欵人購買證劵時。亦由控轄機關爲之辦理。</p>
<p>目本之馬立斯制金融機關流動資金。仍持股票之繳入欵項抵用。倘遇必要。而繳欵不足時。得另行籌借。但此屬例外。其股票之種類。大抵爲左列三項。</p>
<p>（一）普通股票爲普通之有限公司之股票。當創立之初。即行招募。與普通之股票相同。遇公司無盈餘時。即不得派息。　　（二）給酬股票以營利之目的回外間招募。此項股票所繳欵項。爲馬立斯制金融機關流動資金之主要部份。按照日本商法之規定股息須自盈餘中發給。但此項股票。不論公司之盈利與否。均以一定之金額。（大體爲年利五厘）用給酬之名義。分配於各購股人。此有類銀行之普通定期存欵。</p>
<p>（三）分期付欵股票凡欲請求借欵者。均須認購此項分期付欵股票。股欵須按期繳納。</p>
<p>至借欵祗限於購股人。借欵請求人。應先認購股票若干。按期繳欵。然後由經營機關視請求人之按期繳欵成績。貸以欵項。惟數額最多。以對方所認繳金額之二倍爲限。借欵時可無需担保品。但應具保證人二人。借欵人借得欵項後。對於所購股票仍須繼續繳付。至滿額時。即轉售於控轄機關。而以售得之欵。償付債務也。</p>

<p>實業革命後，機械工業代手工業而興，勞動者之供給乃有過剩之勢。戰後己形嚴重，於今爲尤烈。就中要以德國爲最甚。我國因無統計之故，失業人數之多寡無由繼考。維鑑於國内普遍之貧乏，可推斷其數字當必驚人。惟歐美各國與吾國之失業原因其間有一逈然不同之點在，蓋各國之失業乃由於工商業極度發達，　器大量生産以代替勞工致使勞工之需要劇减，因而引起失業。我國則因工商業不發達，勞工之需要至少而失業。今姑僅諭及我國失業之原因及其救濟方法。至歐美之失業問題則從略焉。</p>
<p>（甲）失業者之種類</p>
<p>失業者可粗分之爲下列五種、（一）恃祖先之遺産而坐食者，此種人直可謂之爲無業者。（二）因衰老殘廢不宜於職業者。（三）無固定之職業，生活不克維持而不時失業者。（四）從事某種臨時職業事駿後不能就他職者。（五）無通合職業之能力因而不能受僱者：</p>
<p>（乙）失業之原因</p>
<p>（一）失業者本身之原因，（一）根本懶於作業而坐亨他人勞勲之結果，我國此類人佔據最多數。往往稍有數千元之田産或存欵者卽懶於任事，坐食家中，謹度歲月，非但不事生産，抑且時爲過量之消費。失業者之中以此類人爲最可恥，直販失走卒之不若也。然近年因經濟狀况普遍之凋疲：官吏之剥削及外來經濟勢力之壓迫，此類人已漸見減少，益以羣衆心理漸有以無職業爲恥之傾向，以後當可日益漸少，誠好現象也。（二）由於勞動者之懶惰，品行之不良，有惡嗜好或浪費等惡因而遭雇主解雇·</p>
<p>（二）失業者本身以外之原因，（一）戰爭或災害之勃發，經濟界引起恐慌，因而失業。（二）新機器之發明，丨因採用新機器而致失業增加，我國尚不多見，蓋因我國尚未臻産業發達之境也。（三）經濟界由盛至衰之過程中引起恐慌而失業。（四）季節之變動丨如泥水匠於天前時不能工作，製茶者在茶市過後卽成失業，（五）因同一貨物競爭激烈供給過多因而停業，一工廠一商店之停業，乃産生成千成萬之失業者。（六）工業之移由一地移至另一地。（七）流行之轉變，丨例如昔日流行小帽者，今日則流行呢帽，昔日流行此種花式者，他日又流行他種花式，在此消費者對於物品之愛好轉動期間又可造成無數之失業者。（八）因童工女工價廉竟得取男工之地位而代之，於是男工之失業問題嚴重。</p>
<p>（丙）救濟之方法</p>
<p>救濟之方法可分爲應急的救濟法與根本的救濟法兩種。</p>
<p>（一）應急的救濟法（一）對於失業者於以金錢或物品以爲救濟，含有慈善性質，僅能適用於緊急之一時，而不能垂於永久。蓋若最此供給財物，不僅供給者無能爲力，且足養成　救濟者之惰性。（二）應急工事之舉行。丨此爲政府緊急之舉動授失業者以職業，以緩和其激變，此法較上法有益，蓋可促成失業者自食其力之目的，如築提修道濬河等均是，我國去年武漢大水，政府倡災民築堤以工代賑，卽屬於此。</p>
<p>（二）根本的救濟法（一）政府應取締依賴遺産之坐食者。蓋此輩非但不盡其社會一份子之能力，且吸他人之血汗，直類於社會　蟲，政府宜取締之，輿論應指謫之。（二）防止人口集中盡力在可能範圍内禁止人民遷往人口緊密之都市。（三）普及産業敎育，使學識與技能打成一片，人人得有一專門技能。（四）由政府設立職業介紹所使雇主與勞動者得因所中之紹介各覓得其適當之相對方，而免去無益之勞力與費用。（五）行强迫勞動失業保險制，若能由中央政府或省市政府自爲保險業者則與佳，否則至少須由國家補助，由不以營利爲目的之保險業者承保。（六）擴充并鞏固國營事業，利用機器大規模經營之，俾勞資糾紛罷工失業等事得無形消滅。（七）國營事業之調劑。因季節之變動，勞工之需要時有增减，政府應測定其需要增减之情形　問時利用國營事業以綢和之。使勞工之供給不致過多過少。換言之即在一般産漿界需要勞工甚多之際，停止一部份不急要之國營事業，當勞工需要縮减之際，則恢復此一部份不急要之國營事業以收羅大批失業者：</p>
<p>救濟方法旣如上述。或有難之曰。我國若再採用機器大規模生産，且不將蹈今日歐美各國覆辙乎？曰不然，機器本身非僅一無罪惡，抑且能促進工作之效能，所當判别者乃在運用之手段如何耳。歐美各國因盡量將機器應用於私人産業之下，致造成今日帝國主義之末路，若我能由一善良鞏固抱有無限毅力與雄心之政府在國營原則下善用機器，則非但可躋此老大之國家於産業發達之境，卽失業問題亦可賴是而解决矣。</p>

<p>每千人中之</p>
<p>年　　代　　都市人口　鄉村人口</p>
<p>一九二○　　一八○人　八二○人</p>
<p>一九二五　　二一六人　七八四人</p>
<p>男</p>

<p>未婚者的增加、亦爲社會不景氣所致、女子未婚較低於男子者、因女子結婚年齡較低、而女子死别較多於男子者、因男子續娶固無傷大雅、而女子再醮則有傷風化之故、</p>
<p>（三）職業分配</p>
<p>在全國人口中、其有業無業之分配如下、　　有業者（　）　　無業者（　）</p>
<p>男　　五九·一　　　四○·九</p>
<p>女　　三一·九　　　六八·一</p>
<p>總數　四五·六　　　五四·四</p>
<p>依據例案調查的結果、除無業者不計外、在有業者二九、二二○、○○○人中其職業分配在每千人中約如下、</p>
<p>職　　　業　　人口每千人中</p>

<p>結　　論</p>
<p>一般的帝國主義者、在國家人口稀少的時候、向民衆宣傳人口稀少是怎樣怎樣的有被其它國家侵略的危險、而竭力提倡生育、到人口較多的時候、則立即說、我們人口過剩了、不得不向外發展以謀生存、這幾句話、却把帝國主義的侵略心理輕輕道破、所謂人口過剩、所謂一生命線、﹂都無非是帝國主義侵略的藉口罷、日本底人口每一方粁一六九人、比人比利時底每一方粁二六六人、英國底每方粁一九六人、相差極多、且以北海底地廣人稀、儘可移殖、更何有於人口過剩、所謂生命線、所謂人口問題、無非是帝國主義御用學者所製造的理論而已、</p>

<p>— 賡</p>
<p>國難至今日，實已瀕於生死線上！﹁積極的軍事抵抗﹂與﹁消極的經濟制裁﹂，莫不知其爲答覆日帝國主義之唯一手段，匪但知之，而且多方面的再三聲明，﹁誓﹂必爲之，例如在上者對抗日之﹁誓詞﹂﹁誓師﹂﹁誓死守土﹂﹁誓不生還﹂，在下者對仇貨之﹁誓不買﹂﹁誓不賣﹂﹁誓不用﹂等等，且也，﹁誓﹂之爲﹁誓﹂，其重大意義，不僅在於肝胆照人，天地共鑒，而還含着一種幽默的妙用，足以大大的嚇一嚇日本。好像每一次每一回的﹁誓﹂，都是在指天劃地地對準日本說：﹁東洋小子！我這裏已在賭着咒了，﹁賭咒﹂和你拚了，小子還不怕麽？哼！﹁你試試看！﹂</p>
<p>無奈東洋人眞頑皮，眞混蛋，好像他已打聽淸楚這些有音無形，有氣無力的﹁賭咒﹂聲，與老太婆的咒鷄咒狗并無二樣，所以他始終抱定一種態度，咒憑你咒，幹由我幹，幹了勝利、還要像﹁爬在外衣上的白虱﹂，﹁又吃人又羞人﹂地把事實宣布出來，眞不怕氣煞賭咒之人也！</p>
<p>去年年底，各報曾有過這樣的記載：</p>
<p>﹁最近日幣價格低落，各地反日抵貨無形銷沉，日商爭相輸入各貨，冀得　　一攫萬金，總計一月來，本埠日貨輸入達萬噸左右，</p>
<p>又據最近日本大藏省，發表本年二月份對華貿易，日本之輸出（即我之輸入）計爲三千二百二十六萬三千元日金，三月份者雖尚未發表，但由此巨數類推，以及各商店生意興隆，全國太平景象證之，還是請日本大藏省大發慈悲，勿要發表的好，以免嚇壞了一般﹁愛國之心，未敢後人﹂的愛國分子！</p>
<p>在此抵貨的緊張月份，仇貨反輸入了這麽多，這一定是東洋科學新發明，把日貨暗中生了兩翼或四足，自動的會﹁飛﹂﹁跑﹂到我﹁不買﹂﹁不賣﹂仇貨的商店裏去，然後又分頭﹁飛﹂﹁跑﹂到我﹁不買﹂﹁不用﹂仇貨的好人家來了！所以以後抵制日貨之巨責，只好和某外交家所主張一般的，希望印度人去肩承着罷了！</p>
<p>至於﹁什麽誓，什麽誓﹂的抗日戰爭，又怎麽樣呢？那只消以遼吉黑熱四省的顯明事實爲﹁被加數﹂，再以近日各報所常見之有字的﹁闢謠﹂和無字的﹁黑方框﹂弦外之音爲﹁加數﹂，很簡單的一盤﹁加法﹂，便求得我們所欲求之眞正﹁答數﹂了！</p>

<p>緣吾人日常由銀兩折算銀元時，須以洋釐除銀兩數，因須應用除法，計算手續，較爲麻煩。依算理以甲數除乙數，與以甲數之倒數乘乙數，兩法所得結果完全相等（因Ａ－Ｂ＝Ｂ×Ｉ－Ａ），故欲由銀兩數折算銀元數，可以洋釐之倒數乘銀兩數，以免除除法手續之繁瑣。例如欲以規銀三百六十七兩，依法定洋釐七一五，折算銀元則用除法其式如下：銀兩數３６７</p>
<p>丨丨丨丨丨＝５１３２９元如用乘法其式如洋釐０·７１５</p>
<p>ＩＩ</p>
<p>下：銀兩數×丨丨＝３６７丨丨＝３６５×１·３洋釐０·７１５</p>
<p>９８６＝５１３·２９元蓋依法定洋釐七一五，則規銀一兩應合銀元一·三九八六元，故由銀兩折合銀元時，應以一·三九八六乘銀兩數，其理至明今洋釐旣係法定，必無變動，故此一·三九八六之數，亦固定不變。爲求計算手續簡捷起見，可將此數簡作一·四。按此簡數與原有之實數相差僅○·○○一四元，即在用一·四乘銀兩以求銀元數時，每銀一兩計多算銀元一厘四毫，百兩多算銀元一角四分，千兩多算銀元一元四角，於換算時可加改正。試仍以前題爲例，用捷法計算如下：３６７×１·４＝５１３·８０元５１３·８０丨（３·６７×·１４）＝５１３·８０丨·５１＝５１３·２９元前式中３·６７×·１４係由銀兩折合銀元用一·四乘銀兩時·多算銀元之數，故須減除之。此减除之數，其數字與前式上半式中之乘積相同，故無須計算，止須將小數移上三位，蓋所欲折成銀元之銀兩數，旣爲百位，則减除之數當爲角數也。</p>

<p>— 萍</p>
<p>（一）死</p>
<p>生病不是我專利的事，每個病人的經騐中，無論僅僅是發寒熱之類，他們的意識中很容易浮起恐怕的﹁死﹂字。我的爸爸生病死了，我的表姊生病死了，我的朋友生病死了，我的生病豈能例外，許多可怕的影像，都聚集在帳門的四圍，我好像一會便能死去的一般，但是終於爬起床來了。一切可怕的死的影像，重驅出我記憶之外，被麵包代替了　的位置。除了自殺，死也並不怎樣容易吧？</p>
<p>（二）春</p>
<p>春飄到了人間，感傷的詩人唱出美麗詩句，綠柳碧桃更是歌頌的文字，我似乎記起應該掃墓的時候了。飄泊在海上將近五年，故鄉遠在數千里之外，爸爸墓上的靑草，是否還像我離别時的葱鬱，老母頭上恐怕將堆上如霜的白髮？每個春帶給我的是什麽？在年齡上增加記號，就是死亡的路程；春，你再能給我一個最後的希望嗎？汽車的聲音從窗外送來，告訴我這是到龍華掃墓去的。我倚在窗檻上，遙望西南，春，你再給我一個最後的希望吧！</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese side convened a meeting of Mongolian princes in Rehe, intending to deceive the Mongolian people through political means and achieve their ambition to seize Inner Mongolia. The central government should have a response to this. The Mongolian nationality has strong tenacity, and once their will is set, it is not easy to change. In this respect, there is no problem with the combination of Mongolians and Han Mongolians. Mongolians have been inclined toward the central government for more than a day, and in recent years, the central government has been more attentive to the protection of Mongolians than before. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has sent Chun De to reside in the Chahar, Suiyuan, and Rehe area to contact the Mongolians and investigate their living conditions at any time, hoping that the central government and the Mongolians can communicate in a timely manner. No Mongolian princes should attend the Japanese meeting. Even if there are any, they will have to participate due to environmental pressure and will definitely not want to abandon the Mongolian-Han combination and be used by the Japanese. After receiving this information, the central government, in addition to telegraphically instructing the relevant parties to continue reconnaissance and report at any time, is now studying effective methods to stop it and will send appropriate personnel to Chahar, Suiyuan, and other places to have practical contact with Mongolian princes and Mongolians so that they can unite to prevent the Japanese army from invading.

<p>(1) The Sharpening of Conflicts Among European Countries</p>
<p>British Prime Minister MacDonald has accepted the invitation from the US President. He is scheduled to visit the United States to discuss future world economic problems and their solutions. The US State Department announced on April 7 that it would invite Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, French Premier Daladier, and German Chancellor Hitler to personally attend the World Economic Preparation Conference invited by Washington. The content of the meeting is not officially announced, but according to general observations and statements from officials, it will cover the following three main points. First, how to recover from the global economic panic, market contraction, and overproduction. Second, the arms race is an open secret. The expansion of air forces and the strengthening of land forces are being actively prepared from Western Europe to North America and East to the Pacific Ocean. Efforts should be made to resolve the issue or at least temporarily alleviate it. Third, war debts are a huge cancer between Europe and the United States. How should they be treated in order to be saved? The above three are the major topics to be discussed between the British Prime Minister and the US President. What is the current situation? What will be the future trends? All of them will have direct and indirect impacts on our country. I will briefly discuss them now.</p>
<p>Today's international political situation stands at a crossroads. Where to go and what to do? Political authorities in various countries are struggling to find a definite and appropriate decision. Even experts have diverse opinions, each asserting their own views. In the international arena, there are two major oppositions: capitalism and socialism, which are incompatible with each other. In Europe alone, Germany and Italy are making every effort to develop their unique nationalism, eager to break free from their current difficulties. Germany is eager to break the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles and open up new avenues for the German people. Italy is a poor country with scarce land, but it wants to divide Central European hegemony and gain a leading position on the Mediterranean coast. Therefore, Germany and Italy are allied to threaten France. The British Empire, which is close to but not connected to the European continent, was the world's leading hegemon for fifteen years. However, after the European War, Germany suffered a major setback, and France became the dominant force, threatening to subdue the whole of Europe. The United Kingdom, adhering to its traditional teachings, never wants a single strong country in Europe. Therefore, when Germany was at its peak, having a force confronting Britain in Africa and East Asia, Britain allied with France to contain it. Now, France can politically lead Europe and, economically, even outstrips Britain in terms of gold reserves. At this time, for the sake of its own future, the United Kingdom cannot but be friendly to Germany and Italy and alienate its former ally, France. Therefore, MacDonald flew across the English Channel to discuss arms reduction with the Black Shirt Prime Minister and proposed the Four-Power Pact. France, facing these three-pronged threats, can only protect its security and expand its national strength by linking with the Little Entente to jointly contain Germany and Italy. On the other hand, it shows goodwill to the Soviet Union to contain Britain. Thus, the intricate situation becomes more complex, and the world situation becomes even more gloomy.</p>
<p>(2) The Future of the World Economy</p>
<p>Since the rise and growth of capitalism, economic panic has been a cyclical recurrence. However, the duration of the panic has never been so long as this time, and the damage has never been so severe. Moreover, the economic panic is still in the process of development. In economically developed countries such as the United States and Germany, production restrictions have reached 70% to 80%, and price drops have reached one-third to one-quarter. How can the suffering masses endure such a sight? Even the wealthy (regardless of any country) have huge amounts of monetary capital idling without interest. Only speculation is still active, while real investment is completely frozen. Here are some production figures and prices at the end of 1929 and 1932 as examples.</p>
<p>Production Quantity　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Price</p>
<p>United States　　(1) 47%　　　(1) 47%</p>
<p>United States　　(1) 16%　　　　(1) 37%</p>
<p>France　　(1) 32%　　　(1) 36%</p>
<p>Germany　　(1) 44%　　　(1) 31%</p>
<p>Italy　(1) 30%　　　　(1) 35%</p>
<p>In the early spring of this year, coupled with the financial panic in the United States, capitalist countries are really caught in an endless tragedy. As for the ways to rescue, the conclusion from comprehensive research in various aspects is only two ways. One is to open up the current protectionist tariff barriers of various countries. The other is to stabilize the standard system, so that money can be used for circulation and there is no stagnation.</p>
<p>In fact, the current countries, from political authorities to industrialists in the opposition, have undergone considerable training and have a considerable understanding and recognition of the current crisis. How can they not know that the source of the economic panic is definitely not so simple, and the planning to rescue the panic is not necessarily so easy. The opposite reason for the increase in tariffs in various countries is self-sufficiency within the country, while the development of overseas markets has not been relaxed in half a step. The reason why it does not help to overproduce but leads to a shrinking market is that the general purchasing power within the country has declined abnormally due to extreme exploitation. The rise of rational management has led to chronic unemployment that cannot be saved (the expansion of mechanical power has reduced manpower, and the number of unemployed has increased). The rise of colonial capital has narrowed the overseas consumer market. The more overseas investment, the more the domestic industry will be depressed. In addition, the strong revelation of the Soviet Union's planned economy has made the societies of various countries feel more uneasy. The economic foundation is becoming more unstable due to the low level of consumption. As for the stability of the monetary system, it only has some impact on circulation, but it does not help much to the entire economic panic.</p>

<p>(Changchun) The dispute over the Chinese Eastern Railway is intensifying. "Manchukuo" has used force to prevent the direct connection of freight trains passing through the Russian border areas of eastern and western Manchuria. In fact, the connection of goods passing through Siberia and the Chinese Eastern Railway has been severed. If the Soviet Union orders the Red Russian workers of the Chinese Eastern Railway to strike as a retaliatory measure, "Manchukuo" will accuse it of interrupting international routes and take other measures to counter it, so the issue has suddenly become tense.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of the Navy issued a statement about the truth of Zhang Xueliang selling the naval hospital, the original text says: When Zhang was about to leave for Ping, he arbitrarily and privately sold all the land and buildings of the Tianjin Hospital and Medical School of the Ministry of the Navy to the French Concession authorities where the hospital and medical school were located, exceeding his authority. After the Ministry discovered this, it sent several telegrams to Zhang to stop him, but received no reply. The French Concession authorities, based on the agreement signed by Zhang, led French soldiers and police at the end of the previous month, relying on their strength, to forcibly occupy all the buildings of the school. In addition to separately submitting petitions to the Supreme Military Authority and the Executive Yuan, to file a negotiation with the French side, it is imperative to cancel this illegal contract that confuses the jurisdiction system and sells it beyond authority, and return the original property to the Navy before it is over.

<p>Trade Methods Not Yet Determined</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Twelve batches of Russian goods have recently been imported into China, mostly raw materials, cloth, kerosene, seafood, hardware, and groceries.

Private individuals are still afraid to let go because of the trouble of receiving payments. Three batches of tea bricks and ramie have been exported successively, amounting to 5 or 6 million yuan in Chinese currency. As for the method of Sino-Russian trade, whether it should be state-owned, commercially-operated, or officially-supervised and commercially-operated, the three ministries of Industry, Finance, and Foreign Affairs, because the Sino-Russian Commercial Treaty will soon be negotiated, plan to resolve the principles within this week and submit them to the Central Political Council for approval.

<h3 id="e27">Our Country Adopts Both Conscription and Militia Systems <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Yawei Discusses the Key Points of the Military Service Law</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhou Yawei, Deputy Director of the Training and Supervision Department, talked about the points to note when formulating the military service law in our country, saying that since the National Army Reorganization Conference in the 16th year of the Republic of China stipulated that the national standing army should be 800,000, if this number is taken as the standard, then calculating our country's 400 million population, it is two per thousand. For example, if a village has 1,000 households, only two people need to serve, which is of course difficult. As for the system to be adopted, which one is suitable and which kind of deployment is easy to implement, judging from our national conditions, it seems that the militia system is prone to abuses, because it is compulsory in nature, and it is difficult to guarantee that the people handling it will not use extortion and intimidation. Therefore, our country seems to be suitable to adopt both the conscription and militia systems. When the Central Political Council discussed the principles a few days ago, it has been decided that the standing army will be the conscription system, and the conscripted soldiers will be the militia system. Before implementation, the first step should be a general survey of the national population. Some say that our country's economy is difficult, and the conscription system requires huge expenses, which are difficult to bear. In fact, this is not the case. The so-called national economy should be calculated together with the national economy. If the conscription system is used, there will be military pay, and the national economy will be slightly richer. If the conscription system is used, it will easily affect the national economy. If the national economy is exhausted, the national economy will be difficult, which is a related relationship. Therefore, the conscription system will not affect the national finances. However, there is one important issue, that is, all the improvements of the army, such as treatment, diet, hygiene, etc., and the improvement of the army's reputation and status, in order to break the people's aversion to the army and make everyone happy to serve, then the implementation of the military service law will be very promising.

As for punishing corruption, after discussion by the committee, it is believed that there should be provisions in the criminal law, and there is no need to set up a special court. For disciplinary aspects, the amount of fines should be determined according to the degree of corruption, and the most serious offenders may be sentenced to death, so that corrupt officials will have some caution.

Whether this is true is not known, but (1) Since the National Congress is the party's highest authority, this important issue should be resolved by the National Congress, and a few people should not rashly approve or disapprove.

<p>Havas, Rome, 9th telegram German Deputy Prime Minister Paben and his wife arrived in Rome at 8:25 this morning. German Ambassador to Italy Hasse, Ambassador to the Holy See Bell, and Papal Envoy to the Holy See Li Tete all went to the station to greet them. The Italian government only sent ceremonial officials to greet them, because Paben's trip to Italy was a private tour. Paben declared to the representative of the "Messenger News" that he would stay in Rome until April 18 and would be received by the Pope of Rome and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and then return home by plane with his wife and Prussian Interior Minister Goring. Paben mentioned the US President's invitation to Germany to send representatives to Washington to discuss the economic conference, saying that this invitation is enough to show the White House's goodwill towards the German government. He also said that the sole purpose of the new German government is to promote the healthy abilities of the German people, but this ability is enough to help the country and eliminate the difficulties caused by communism. In conclusion, he said that the friendship expressed by Fascist Italy and the leaders of the Fascist Party is a cherished encouragement for Germany's construction. It is rumored in Rome political circles that German Foreign Minister Neurath will arrive in Rome on Sunday, but this statement has now been denied by Berlin.</p>

<p>Washington Conference and World Economic Recovery</p>
<h3 id="e64">Key Points of Roosevelt's Plan <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Reduce Tariffs, Stabilize Exchange Rates, Raise Prices</p>
<p>International Trade Could Increase by Three Hundred Billion Annually</p>
<p>MacDonald and Herriot to Sail Together to the U.S.</p>
<p>Washington, 8th (National Telegram) – (1) Substantially reducing tariffs to allow countries to sell surplus goods, (2) stabilizing international exchange rates, and (3) universally abandoning nationalistic economic policies will be the core of discussions between the U.S. and representatives from various countries. If these fundamental principles can be agreed upon, the U.S. government estimates that international trade could increase from the current 160 billion gold dollars to 500 billion gold dollars annually.</p>
<p>The State Department believes these negotiations can be concluded before the World Economic Conference convenes in London on June 15th. Secretary of State Hull stated today that it is time to end high tariffs, promote international trade, and lead the world out of the mire of economic nationalism. Since the European war, the entire world has been trapped in this mire, unable to extricate itself. He also said he believes President Roosevelt is prepared to propose proposals and concessions that all countries can agree to.</p>
<p>While the President's plan has not yet been released, reliable sources indicate it will likely include the following: (1) revising all tariffs, even eliminating some, to promote international trade; (2) stabilizing international exchange rates, preferably gradually moving towards a universal return to the gold standard; (3) raising prices. However, Secretary of State Hull and those close to the President have not indicated how this will be achieved. Recently, there have been many proposals to inflate the currency, but the Secretary of State and most cabinet members oppose this. The President has not yet expressed his position.</p>
<p>The State Department received a telegram today stating that British Prime Minister MacDonald and former French Premier Herriot may travel to the U.S. together on the Berengaria ship. Herriot has accepted his appointment as the leader of the special envoy to the U.S. and is expected to depart from Southampton on that ship.</p>
<p>Before MacDonald and others arrive in the U.S., the President will send a message to Congress requesting broad powers to negotiate tax agreements separately with each country. With this authority, the President can freely discuss and accept or reject proposals from various countries and propose reciprocal treaties.</p>
<p>It is reported that the U.S. government is directly inviting only Britain, Italy, Germany, China, Japan, and the major Latin American countries. For other countries, it is stated that the U.S. welcomes joint consultations through the usual diplomatic channels. It is expected that European representatives will first discuss with the President, as Roosevelt firmly believes that cooperation between Europe and the U.S. can lead the economic recovery of the world. Although the economic situation in Latin America will affect trade between both Europe and the U.S., it will primarily affect the U.S. Therefore, discussions with South American experts will take place after consultations with other countries are completed, focusing mainly on stabilizing exchange rates.</p>
<p>Washington, 8th (National Telegram) – A recent survey of members of both the House and Senate regarding attitudes towards currency inflation reveals that if the proponents of inflation can agree on a single plan and have the President champion it, it could pass by a majority. Otherwise, without presidential leadership, such a plan will at least be temporarily shelved. It is rumored that those close to the President now believe that a carefully considered and well-managed inflation plan may be feasible. Secretary of State Hull, Agriculture Secretary Wallace, and Labor Secretary Perkins are also reportedly leaning towards this view, while other cabinet members oppose currency inflation. The President and Treasury Secretary Woodin remain silent but are reportedly opposed to inflation at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Herriot Represents France <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Paris, 9th (Havas) – Former Premier Herriot has agreed to represent France in Washington to discuss world economic issues with President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt stated that he hoped that when MacDonald visits the U.S., France would also send a highly respected individual to Washington to exchange views. All economic and financial matters should be discussed to prepare for the World Economic Conference. Therefore, French Premier Daladier and Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour requested former Premier Herriot to undertake this important task. Herriot's cabinet was overthrown last December due to disagreements with Congress regarding the repayment of war debts to the U.S. His appointment to visit the U.S. is welcomed by Washington.</p>
<p>Paris, 9th (Havas) – Herriot is traveling to the U.S. in the capacity of a "free observer," and will therefore not make any promises. However, all important information will be reported to the French government so that the government can understand the truth and decide on measures regarding the issues discussed at the White House, especially the war debt issue.</p>
<p>Washington, 9th (Havas) – Washington is pleased with the news that Herriot will represent France in the U.S. President Roosevelt has not yet decided on the attitude France should take. Political circles hope France can soon repay the war debts that were due on December 15th of last year. It is generally believed that Congress will grant the President the power to handle war debts, especially the war debts due on June 15th of this year.</p>
<p>London, 8th (Reuters) – According to Berlin sources, German Ambassador to the U.S. Dr. Luther and another embassy official will represent Germany. Dr. Luther is well-versed in Germany's economic difficulties and world affairs, so the German cabinet selected him as their representative so that German Chancellor Hitler or Foreign Minister Neurath do not have to visit Washington D.C. in person. The Italian government has not yet made a decision regarding sending a representative to the U.S., but it is expected that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, who has not left Italy since 1923, will likely not participate personally.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Den-tsu) – Regarding the upcoming preliminary meeting for the World Economic Conference, the U.S. Undersecretary of State verbally invited Japan to participate on the afternoon of the 7th through Ambassador Debuchi to the U.S. According to the telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the invitation included the following: "The President intends to personally meet with representatives of major countries to discuss preparations for the World Economic Conference and has already issued invitations to various countries. This meeting will touch upon disarmament issues, and it is hoped that your government will also send an important official as a representative."</p>

<p>New Invention by Soviet Professor</p>
<p>(Reuters, 9th, Moscow) Professor Koltsov, Director of the Moscow Animal Breeding Institute, claims to have invented a new method by which the gender of animals can be predetermined. He has created an electrical procedure to separate male and female sperm. If one desires to produce a male offspring, the mother is injected with a liquid that isolates the female sperm. If one desires a female, the opposite is done. The results are as intended. He has tested this method on female rabbits three times and has been successful in each instance.</p>
<p>It has been decided to accept this offer and instructions will be sent to Ambassador Debuchi on the 10th, replying that Japan will participate in the discussions. The government's representatives should address the issues of war debts and disarmament. It is uncertain whether Prime Minister Saito or a member of the cabinet will represent Japan in the U.S. However, given the preliminary discussions will be held on the 22nd and 23rd, it will be impossible to arrive in time. Consequently, Ambassador Debuchi will be appointed, assisted by Finance Official Tsushima. However, as the U.S. President will meet with each country's representatives separately, arriving by the 22nd or 23rd is not required. It is also possible that another important official will be sent, and this is currently being considered. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Ambassador Debuchi to report in detail.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Den-tsu) – The International Economic Conference will be held before July 25th. Starting June 10th, preliminary discussions will be held in Washington by the major countries. The Japanese government, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Finance at its center, has established a committee to discuss countermeasures. The general policy adopted is as follows: (1) Although the issue of war debts is not directly related to Japan, Japan will fully assist the economic conference to help the world overcome the current economic downturn, in cooperation with various countries. However, regarding the issue of disarmament, Japan will adhere to its established policy, namely, upholding the contents of the Japanese proposal submitted to the Geneva General Disarmament Committee. (2) Regarding international economic policy, Japan will advocate the following points to achieve coordination: (A) Based on enabling a return to the gold standard, internationally adjust prices and economic problems. (B) Restore the price of silver. (C) In order to regulate the movement of capital, strive to ease exchange rate restrictions. (D) To ensure freedom of trade and thoroughly realize it, seek international coordination on tariff policies.</p>

<p>Washington, 9th (Havas) – Secretary of State Hull declared to the press that the commercial policies that the world has adhered to for more than a decade must be completely overturned today. Hull continued that the development of economic nationalism is partly the responsibility of the United States. The economic panic has prevented world commerce from proceeding, and the United States has been the first to be affected. Currently, the United States feels it is appropriate to adopt a more sound and constructive policy. The U.S. government has no bizarre ambitions. What it seeks is only to overcome the difficulties. Currently, there is only one way out: to abandon the policy of excessive protection of domestic goods and allow foreign goods to be sold within its borders, without exclusively expecting other countries to purchase domestic goods.</p>
<p>Washington, 8th (Reuters) – Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that the primary goal of the United States in future economic discussions is to lead the world out of the predicament of economic nationalism. In recent years, countries around the world have revised their tax laws and competed with each other, causing great harm. The United States is one of the creators of this situation and one of the most severely impacted. In the past few years, U.S. foreign trade has decreased by a significant amount of six hundred billion dollars. The goal of this conversation is to seek a general compromise on the principles of reducing tax rates and abolishing exchange rate restrictions. Due to time constraints, quantity-based tax rates will be left to each country to determine on its own. As for practical solutions and detailed methods, they will be discussed at the upcoming World Economic Conference. According to today's news, Canada and Mexico have been invited by the U.S. to send representatives to participate in the discussions.</p>

Although Davis was extremely busy today, he was still able to meet with the National News Agency's correspondent in Germany and have a brief conversation. Davis described German Chancellor Hitler as a man with great explosive power, and regarding the current situation, he said that today's era is not only educational but also encouraging. Davis had an audience with President Hindenburg at noon today and was invited to lunch with Foreign Minister Neurath. In the afternoon, he visited Chancellor Hitler, and Foreign Minister Neurath also participated in the discussion.</p>

<p>Two Days of Sales Sufficient to Float a Battleship</p>
<p>Tens of Thousands of Unemployed People Find Work</p>
<p>New York, 9th (Reuters) – According to observers skilled in calculations, if domestic breweries can produce legal beer to meet the constant demand, the beer sold on Friday and Saturday would be sufficient to float two battleships. In any event, the beer sold in the first twenty-four hours after the end of Prohibition in the United States was sufficient to float one battleship. At least seventy million people in twenty-one states and the District of Columbia happily drank, consuming one million to one and a half million barrels of beer, and local and central governments each received several million dollars in taxes. Although factories produced a lot of beer, it was still not enough to meet demand. However, the police have not seen any incidents of public drunkenness. The brewing and sale of beer has enabled tens of thousands of unemployed people to find work, and there is a general feeling of optimism about the recovery of commerce everywhere. Railways transporting large quantities of beer have also indirectly benefited. It is expected that the opening of new breweries will absorb several hundred thousand unemployed workers. In New York alone, revenue from brewing and selling beer licenses has reached two hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Saito and the Japanese Political Situation <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Fascist Dictatorship and Parliamentary Politics</p>
<p>The Key Lies in Saito's Advance and Retreat</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Japan Alliance) – Some in political circles observe that a political change will definitely occur when Finance Minister Takahashi resigns at the end of April or the beginning of May. However, the movement to implement measures to extend the Saito cabinet's life in various forms is now attracting considerable attention. That is, those around Prime Minister Saito and the heads of the Minseito party, bureaucratic factions, and members of the House of Peers are running around seeking to extend the life of the current cabinet. Furthermore, senior statesmen in the Imperial Court also hope that political changes will not occur. It is said that when Privy Council Chairman Kuratomi met with Prime Minister Saito, Kuratomi stated that he would overcome all difficulties and strive to remedy the current situation. Therefore, when Justice Minister Oyama submitted his resignation, Saito uniquely sought an Imperial Rescript, with the Prime Minister proceeding from such a reputation with a firm resolve. The reasons for wanting to extend the life of the current cabinet are roughly as follows: the Saito cabinet's mission is to remove the danger of Japanese politics falling into a fascist dictatorship after the May 15th Incident, that is, to respect parliamentary politics, to request both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties to join the cabinet, and to work to remove social unrest. They also opened two parliamentary sessions, dealt with rural issues, and also, by going through the parliament, had 230 million of the great budget pass, for protection of the "Manchukuo," and implemented the withdrawal from the League of Nations. However, international relations after withdrawing from the League of Nations are deemed very important, and the credibility of political parties has not yet been restored. If the Saito cabinet were to fall, it would be very difficult to return to constitutional normalcy. Therefore, it would be better to maintain the current state of the current cabinet, and at the same time strive to restore the credibility of the political parties, and only after gaining confidence in the return to constitutional normalcy can the current cabinet be dissolved. These reasons are now resonating with various parties in political circles, so the so-called life extension movement of the cabinet may hold hope.</p>

He left at 3:40 p.m. He then visited Prince Fumimaro Konoe at the Daitokan in Shizuoka before returning to Kyoto.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (China Alliance) – Army Minister Araki will visit Finance Minister Takahashi tomorrow to test Takahashi's attitude towards the future Japanese political situation and to specifically deliberate on the huge military expenditure budget passed by the 64th Diet session and the earnest consolidation of various pursuit budgets. Because the fate of the current cabinet is already pressing on the issue of Finance Minister Takahashi's departure, the meeting between the two ministers tomorrow is particularly noteworthy to the world.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Luan Dong Our Army's Defensive Lines Are Solidified <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Fierce Battle at Haiyang Town for Three Days and Nights</p>
<p>Even More Intense Battles Expected</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: The Japanese army has changed its strategy, invading Luan Dong and Rehe simultaneously, putting pressure on both the east and west lines. Our army's battle plans have also changed slightly in response. Here is a report on the situation in Luan Dong:</p>
<p>At the beginning of the tense Luan Dong battles, He Yingqin, chairman of the Beiping Military Affairs Commission, telegraphed important front-line generals to Beiping to discuss strategy. Song Zheyuan, Yu Xuezhong, Pang Bingxun, Gao Guizi, Wang Yizhe, and others responded and arrived in Beiping one after another. After discussions, everyone agreed that the Japanese army had changed its strategy, focusing on Luan Dong and Rehe, and our army's defenses had to be adjusted accordingly. It was decided to redeploy the Luan Dong troops, allocating a portion of the troops from the various passes of the Great Wall to reinforce Luan Dong. After the meeting, He immediately issued orders to mobilize the troops that day. The troops transferred consisted of approximately three units, focusing on the area north of the railway. After this reorganization, the defensive lines should be more solid.</p>
<p>The Japanese army's attempts to invade Luan Dong included, in addition to the 14th Division and the puppet army led by Li Jichun, the transfer of the Hattori and Suzuki brigades from the Xifengkou area. The pretext for their invasion was that over ten Japanese soldiers were killed by our garrison while scouting ahead at Shimen Village. In reality, the Japanese army deliberately provoked the incident to justify their invasion. Since the start of the fighting, the Japanese army first occupied Shimen, then split into two routes to invade westward, one crossing the Liujiang River to attack Haiyang Town, and the other attacking Tanghe Tiemazhuang from Shihe Hongwadian. Haiyang Town is an important town on the eastern front, and both sides attached great importance to it. At 9:00 a.m. on the 3rd, the Japanese army advanced along the Liujiang Railway towards Haiyang Town, and another unit attempted to approach Qidao from the southeast of Anminzhai. They were met with a head-on attack by our army, and a fierce battle ensued for a day and night, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. On the 4th, enemy reinforcements arrived, and Haiyang Town was temporarily lost. However, our army counterattacked and immediately recaptured it. On the 5th, the Japanese army regrouped and, on one hand, sent over 5,000 troops to invade Haiyang again, and on the other hand, sent aircraft to bomb Qian'an, Lulong, and Luanzhou to threaten our rear. The fighting around Haiyang Town became even more intense. After two days and one night of bloody battle and over ten hand-to-hand combat encounters, our army eventually withdrew yesterday (the 6th) due to strategic considerations. This morning (the 7th), He Zhuguo personally went to the front line to supervise the battle and ordered reinforcements from the rear to launch a general counterattack along the entire front line. Fierce battles occurred around Lipanzhuang near Haiyang Town and Wangjialing on the Pingyu Avenue. From morning to noon, our army made significant progress, with the vanguard having crossed Dawangzhuang. On the Tanghe front, the important areas of Wujiazhuang were also recaptured. Furthermore, five Japanese aircraft bombed the area between Qinhuangdao and Haiyang Town this morning. Due to international relations, the Japanese marines did not dare to land on Qinhuangdao, which remained calm. However, the Japanese army's invasion of Luan Dong focused on the area north of the railway, and they claimed that they would not stop until they occupied Luan Dong. Our army is determined to resist the enemy and has deployed large reinforcements. Even more intense main force battles are expected to occur within days.</p>
<p>Reports from the front lines over the past few days included the following: (1) On the Haiyang front, the headquarters of a certain army sent a telegram to Beiping this morning (the 7th) reporting on the fierce battle in Haiyang Town. The telegram stated, "Over a thousand enemy troops fiercely attacked Haiyang Town at dawn. Our cavalry regiments led by Wang, Shi, Xu, Liu, and the Ba battalion of the Jin regiment fought bravely against the enemy. They have not rested since yesterday. The enemy has reinforced with over two thousand troops and over twenty artillery pieces along the Liujiang Road. Our army is still calmly responding, killing two to three hundred enemies. Haiyang has finally been recaptured by our army. The remaining enemy troops are actively resisting. In this battle, our army fought fiercely for two days and nights under enemy fire, repeatedly advancing and retreating. The blood stained Haiyang, and the white bones and corpses were extremely tragic. Our officers and soldiers suffered the loss of a cavalry major company commander, over ten platoon leaders, and over two hundred soldiers." (2) On the Tanghe front, a certain military agency released the following information: "(1) At around 2:00 a.m. on the 6th, a certain cavalry unit of our army recaptured Wujiazhuang. A certain infantry unit of our army, in coordination with a certain cavalry unit, recaptured Wangjialing. In this battle, the third company commander of the cavalry was wounded, and over twenty soldiers were killed. The enemy's losses are unknown, but over twenty corpses were left behind. (2) At dawn on the 6th, approximately five to six hundred enemies invaded the □□ area on the left flank of our army. Our □ unit is currently driving them away. (3) On the evening of the 5th, a certain unit of our army, in coordination with the cavalry, advanced and recaptured Qijin Camp at noon on the 6th. The enemy retreated north of Haiyang. (4) Lipanzhuang, which had been occupied by the enemy, was recaptured by our artillery in coordination with a certain unit after several hours of fierce fighting, killing many enemies. The enemy fled north of Haiyang. (5) Our cavalry □ unit is currently attacking the enemy at Daxiaolizhuang." (3) On the Shimenzhai front, He Zhuguo telegraphed Beiping today, stating, "Since the morning of the 31st of last month, the Iwata detachment of the enemy at Jiunmenkou, in coordination with artillery, advanced on our Shahezhai positions and attacked fiercely several times, but were repelled by our garrison. In the afternoon, approximately three thousand Japanese and puppet troops were also discovered in the Qiuziyu area to the left rear, contacting our □ unit. Fierce fighting continued until evening. The enemy then reinforced with superior forces, surrounding our Shahezhai from three sides. Our defenders fought bravely, supporting themselves with great effort. Due to enemy artillery fire, they temporarily withdrew to the □□□□ line to plan a counterattack. At midnight that night, they ordered the □ unit to counterattack, which went smoothly, advancing to Dayu. They were ambushed by the enemy, and fighting raged until dawn. The enemy then bombed with over ten aircraft. Our army did not suffer any losses. On the morning of the 1st, the enemy used two thousand newly added troops, passing through Taoyu to attack fiercely the □ area on our left flank. Their momentum was very fierce, and they concentrated artillery fire and continuous bombings by fifteen aircraft from aircraft carriers. Bloody battles continued until 3:00 p.m. when the newly added enemy infantry broke through, but our □ unit still defended the □□□ area, resisting tenaciously. Their morale was extraordinarily high. Although they were heavily surrounded, they were determined to live and die with their positions and charged the enemy again and again, suffering repeated casualties. Relying on our reinforcing □ unit's coordinated attacks from both inside and outside, the enemy suffered severe damage. Our □ unit, due to two days and nights of bloody fighting, for the sake of reorganization, and because the location had been bombed by enemy artillery and aircraft, and there was no need to defend the original location, began to withdraw to the □ area for reorganization. At around 4:00 p.m. on the same afternoon, a unit of the enemy circled to attack our certain unit at Shihe, causing them to be surrounded. Our army, under enemy pressure, withdrew to Anminzhai. The enemy pursued, but was met with a head-on attack by our army's □ unit. The enemy's momentum was unsustainable, and they retreated backward. There was no fierce fighting on the 2nd, but small units had some contact. At 9:00 a.m. on the 3rd, approximately three thousand Japanese and puppet troops, a combined force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, attacked Haiyang Town along the Liujiang Railway. One unit attempted to approach Qinhuangdao from the southeast of Anminzhai, and another unit forced the troops in our □□ area from Shangxiaping Village. Our □ unit fought the enemy for a day and night. By dawn on the 4th, the enemy added more troops, cooperating with armored vehicles and aircraft to attack fiercely. Haiyang Town was temporarily occupied by the enemy. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. I immediately ordered the □□ unit to actively counterattack, engaging in hand-to-hand combat for three hours. Our army finally recaptured Haiyang. The remaining enemy troops retreated towards Taiping Village. As of now, our army still holds Qinhuangdao. In recent days, the area along the right bank of the Tanghe River has been facing the enemy. The enemy's total strength in this invasion is approximately ten thousand mixed troops of Japanese and puppets, approximately sixty artillery pieces, and over twenty armored vehicles. Their main force is now in the Zashi Village and Daan Village areas. Just as the telegram was being sent, the enemy took advantage of the darkness of night to launch a large-scale attack on the □□ area on our Pingyu Avenue. Fierce fighting is currently underway."

<p>The Red Bandits on All Routes Have Been Repelled</p>
<p>Provincial Defenses are Consolidated and Rumors are Allayed</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Zhu and Mao recently gathered the forces of Luo Binghui of the pseudo-Western Fujian Military District, Fang Zhimin of the pseudo-Jiangxi-Zhejiang-Fujian Military District, Chen Yi of the pseudo-Southern Jiangxi (i.e., Central District) Military District, Li Tianzhu of the pseudo-Jiangxi-Hunan Military District, as well as pseudo-independent army divisions, guerrilla advancement teams, etc., in the central section of the Gan River and at the junction of eastern and southern Jiangxi. Together with the pseudo-1st, 3rd, and 5th Army Corps, they attempted to approach Nanchang via Jinxi, Yihuang, Le'an, and Xingan, towards Fuzhou and Zhangshu, as a last-ditch effort. Commander-in-Chief Chiang, considering the rampant banditry, arrived in the province from Nanjing late on the 5th. On the morning of the 6th, he went to Fuzhou with Chairman Xiong to inspect the troops. Upon hearing the news of Chiang's arrival, the morale was greatly boosted. Chiang stayed at the headquarters of the Central Route Commander-in-Chief. That evening, there was an important military conference. Central Route Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng, as well as commanders of various columns Wu Qiwei, Luo Zhuoying, and army division commanders Zhou Zhirou, etc., were present. After the generals gave detailed reports on the military situation at the front lines, they secretly discussed future strategies for suppression, communication between armies, allocation of forces, and other matters. After the meeting, the army division commanders returned to the front lines in Yihuang, Le'an, Xuhan, and other places to command. It was found that the main force of the Red Bandits was divided into three major groups. Zhu and Mao's pseudo-1st and 3rd Army Corps gathered at the border of Yihuang, Le'an, and Chongren. Dong Zhentang's pseudo-5th Army Corps, Fang Shao's pseudo-10th and 11th Army Corps, gathered at the border of Nanfeng and Zixi. These two routes were completely focused on Fuzhou. Mao Zedong's scattered bandits in southern Jiangxi, Chen Yi and Mao Zetan on the east bank of the Gan River, and various pseudo-independent divisions, as well as the pseudo-8th Army and pseudo-21st, 2nd, and 3rd Divisions that had fled to Xiajiang, gathered in Xingan and Yongfeng, focusing on the Zhangshu area to support the bandits in Fuzhou. When Chiang arrived in Fuzhou, Fang Shao's pseudo-11th Army main force had penetrated from Jinxi to Bajiating near Xuhan, about sixty li from Fuzhou. A certain division immediately launched a night attack from Fuzhou, encountering the bandits at Changgongguanbu (the border area between Jinxi and Linchuan). After several hours of bloody battle, the bandits were defeated and retreated to Jinxi. The division took advantage of the victory to pursue, killing the 94th Regiment Commander Yu Jinliang and hundreds of bandits, and immediately pursued past Fengshanbu. Jinxi can be recaptured again. In Yihuang and Le'an, the national army's various columns still guarded their original defenses, and there were no major changes in the front line. In Yongfeng, from the 2nd to the 4th, more than ten thousand of the pseudo-1st Army Corps besieged the county town. Sun Lianzhong's division's brigade stubbornly defended the city. On the evening of the 4th, they launched a surprise attack out of the city, ambushing the bandits and repelling them. As for the bandits in the Xingan area, because the bandits in Fuzhou did not make any progress, they dared not penetrate further. More than ten thousand bandits were discovered yesterday in Qiqin, more than fifty li from Xingan. The national army has transferred capable troops to block them along the Gan River from [missing text]. The Zhangshu area is like an outer city wall of the provincial capital, and a certain unit is deployed there. At the same time, the [missing text] independent brigade has arrived in Nanchang, and the city defense works attached to the city are extremely solid. Since Chiang's arrival, rumors have been allayed. (April 9th)</p>

<p>Shantou Dispatch: The 19th Route Army's support troops for the Rehe front line, consisting of [missing text] regiments, approximately [missing text] men, divided into [missing text] two columns, after gathering at Longyan and Kanshi in Fujian Province, immediately entered Guangdong Province. The commanding officers are Tan Qixiu and Zhang Yan. After the army set out, Tan went to Guangzhou to consult with the military and political authorities on the route north, supplies, and meeting of forces. The army passed through central Guangdong, led by Chief of Staff Zhao Yijian and Li Kuo, with all regimental and battalion commanders accompanying the army. The [missing text] column entered Dapu Shiyun from Pinghe on the Fujian border on March 29th, passing through Fenglang and exiting at Tongren Sanheba. The artillery and baggage train were transported by electric boats to Songkou, while the soldiers marched to Meixian. Along the way, every village and town hung flags and set off firecrackers to welcome them. Vendors selling food on the road also offered the army particularly cheap prices. On March 31st, the army arrived at Songkou and proceeded to Meicheng via the Songmei Highway. Among the soldiers, there were many from the Chaozhou-Meizhou area. Seeing the warm welcome from their elders, they were especially happy. All sectors of Meixian held a farewell rally at the public sports field. Beforehand, the county government, party headquarters, and council had raised funds and prepared many gifts to reward the troops. The headquarters of the 7th Division stationed in Meixian, together with the police bureau, designated the area around the Meixian market as the army's quarters because it was close to the Meixing Road. It is said that they will stay for one or two days to gather before departing for Xingning and Huizhou. They are expected to reach Huiyang before the 10th. It is not yet certain whether they will proceed from Huizhou to Wengyuan in northern Guangdong or directly to Shaoguan. However, it is reported that after the Fujian, Guangxi, and Guangdong armies gather in southern Hunan, Cai Tingkai will go to southern Hunan to launch an oath-taking ceremony and take up the post of commander-in-chief before advancing north at full speed.

<h3 id="e75">The Ministry of Communications Revises the Contents of the Mackay Contract <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Contract Signed by Chen Mingshu</p>
<p>Clauses Unfavorable to Us Are Completely Deleted</p>
<p>The Aircraft Purchase Contract Is Canceled and Renegotiated</p>
<p>The Mackay Communications Contract and the China Electric Company Aircraft Purchase Contract were formally signed in July of last year by Minister of Communications Chen Mingshu with the American Mackay Company and the China Electric Company. Subsequently, the contents and clauses of the Mackay Communications Contract were found to have points unfavorable to us. Furthermore, the China Electric Company Aircraft Purchase Contract, regarding the purchase of equipment including a wireless telephone super-power radio station and four small radio stations, considering the current situation in our country, international wireless telephone communication is not yet very urgent. The price reached a huge sum of US$310,000, which seems difficult to raise. The repayment method was also taken from the telephone and telegraph income of the Mackay Communications Contract. The engineering management was also authorized to the China Electric Company. All of this exceeded the scope of a normal sales contract. Therefore, after the two contracts were formally signed, there was national public opposition, and the Ministry of Communications once again discussed canceling them. However, because it involved canceling signed contracts, repeated negotiations with the companies were unsuccessful, and they insisted on not agreeing. Only in October of last year was the China Electric Company willing to reduce the price of the aircraft to US$250,000 as a concession. The Ministry of Communications considered that the remaining conditions were still harsh and did not immediately agree. When Zhu Jia骅 succeeded Chen Mingshu as Minister of Communications, he continued to actively negotiate. However, because the contracts had already been formally signed and the companies insisted on not conceding, for the sake of government credibility and factual difficulties, completely canceling the contracts proved to be difficult due to reason and reality. Therefore, the negotiations had to change direction. For the Mackay contract, the points unfavorable to us were deleted and revised. For the China Electric Company aircraft purchase contract, it was completely canceled and reorganized. The purchase list was further reduced in price, and a new aircraft purchase contract based on a purely commercial sales agreement was drawn up. The right to manage the project was recovered, and it was ensured that it was not related to the Mackay Communications Contract. Furthermore, funds were allocated from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Funds for the Huai River Commission's London material procurement, to be procured by the London China Purchasing Committee, so as not to be subjected to any constraints. The Ministry of Communications submitted the details of the negotiation process and revision methods to the Executive Yuan meeting this Wednesday, which was approved and formally signed yesterday (the 7th). The main points of the two contracts are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e76">Key Points of the Revised Mackay Contract <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>(1) Direct communication is limited to the United States. The original contract stipulated that direct communication locations included Hawaii and the Philippines in addition to the United States. Because our international radio station's current receiving equipment is not sufficient and there is not much telegraph communication between the two locations, one circuit is sufficient. The revised direct destination is only the United States, but it is stipulated that if the Sino-US direct circuit is blocked, it can be relayed through the Philippine radio station, but the sharing of fees is still the same as direct telegraphs. (2) Equal sharing of circuit fees. The original contract stipulated that the radio circuit fee was two-thirds for the transmitting side and one-third for the receiving side. However, our outbound telegraphs are limited to those with route identification, while all of Mackay's telegraphs, except for those with other designated routes, must be forwarded through this route. The number of inbound telegraphs will inevitably be greater than the number of outbound telegraphs, and their fees will be higher than ours. This modification is for both parties to share equally, which is more beneficial to us. (3) Cancellation of the provision to distribute outbound telegraph paper printed with route identification. Article 11 of the original contract contained the above provision. The Ministry of Communications considered that our communications contracts with various foreign companies did not have such a precedent. This modification has been canceled. (4) Deletion of words involving South American international communications. The original contract contained clauses involving international communications with South American countries. The Ministry of Communications believes that when our country's international communications industry develops in the future, international communications may be monopolized by the Mackay Company, and there is a risk of future misinterpretation of the contract, leading to disputes. This modification has been deleted. (5) The contract is mainly in Chinese.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Key Points of the Separately Agreed Upon Aircraft Purchase Agency <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>(1) Purely a sales contract. The original contract and the conditions of the revised contract stipulated that when the Ministry signs telephone contracts with other countries, the company agrees to assist, use the telegraph and telephone revenue from the Mackay Communications Contract to pay off the unpaid equipment price, and have the company recommend an engineering manager, etc., which exceeded the scope of a sales contract and were actually unfavorable to us. This time, when the Ministry of Communications discussed purchasing aircraft with the company, it ignored the original contract and determined that the purchase of equipment was purely a commercial sales contract and should not involve personnel administration and other issues, so as to avoid extraneous matters. This new contract was based on this principle. As for the funds for purchasing equipment, the Ministry of Communications, under very difficult economic circumstances, plans to allocate funds from the British Boxer Indemnity for the Huai River Commission's London material procurement, to be procured by the London China Purchasing Committee, to transact with the company in cash and never incur debts, so as to avoid being constrained. (2) Selection of equipment. The original contract stipulated the purchase of one super-power radio station and four small radio stations. In the current situation in our country, international telephone communication cannot be very developed at the beginning, and Marconi radio stations also have broadcasting telephone equipment. It is only necessary to add a receiving station and a telephone connection machine and a secret telephone machine. Therefore, it was decided not to purchase a super-power radio station. However, small telephone stations are needed because our country's important long-distance telephone lines, such as Beijing-Tianjin, Pinghan (Beijing-Hankou), Shanghai-Hankou, are all lacking. Therefore, it is planned to expand these by purchasing three for application. The rest will be used to carefully select the equipment that our country urgently needs, reduce prices, and increase purchases. The important equipment to be purchased this time includes: (1) three small wireless telegraph and telephone dual-use transmitting stations; (2) three automatic telegraph machines; (3) six Type II receiving stations; (4) four telephone connection machines; (5) four secret telephone machines; (6) two Type III receiving stations; together with antennas, vacuum tubes, and engines, etc., totaling 48,000 British pounds. The Ministry of Communications inquired about this price from various countries and compared it with other telegraph stations and broadcasting telephone stations, and it was extremely fair.</p>

<h3 id="e78">The Discovery of Antiquities in Teng County <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Teng County Dispatch: Teng County in southern Shandong, formerly the State of Teng in the Zhou Dynasty, has a history of more than 2,000 years. The tomb of Duke Wen of Teng is located in the county seat, which was the Temple of Literature during the Qing Dynasty and is now Zhongshan Square. Although the [foundation] has disappeared, the people of the county still mention it. Recently, fourteen antiquities, including ding (tripod), pan (dish), and yi (ewer), were discovered in Anshang Village, Eighth Township, Second District of Teng County, attracting great attention in society. Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, and He Siyuan, Director of the Department of Education, believe that Teng County has such a long history in our country's past, and now the discovery of these antiquities is undoubtedly excellent material for scholars studying and writing national history. They immediately sent telegrams to the Teng County Government to properly preserve them, and also dispatched Wang Xiantang, Director of the Shandong Provincial Library, to personally investigate in Teng County. Wang (Xiantang) left Jinan on April 4th. Since the news of the discovery of antiquities in various places has been emerging in recent years, reporters often regret not being able to personally witness them and provide readers with accurate reports. Now that the authorities attach such importance to antiquities, and Wang Xiantang, who is knowledgeable about antiquities, is sent to Teng County for investigation, it is expected that this trip will have some contributions. Moreover, Teng County is only 500 li from Jinan, and the Pingpu train can reach it in eight hours. Therefore, the reporter took the Ping 201 train south from Jinan at 9:40 a.m. the next day (the 5th) of Wang's departure, arriving in Teng County at 5 p.m. that afternoon, and immediately went to the county government to inquire about everything. County Magistrate Cui Gongfu and local representatives were holding a variety show (drama) at Zhongshan Square to raise funds to comfort the soldiers at the front. Therefore, his secretary, Shen Liangjie, received the reporter on his behalf.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Shen Liangjie's Statement <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>According to his statement, the antiquities were discovered by Chen Shifa, a farmer in Anshang Village, Eighth Township, Second District of the county, who also runs a tofu business. In the spring, Chen Shifa was plowing his land and plowed out a broken pot. After uncovering the pot, he saw a hole, so he continued to dig down and found two ancient tripods, one ancient dish, and four ancient ewers, all with lids, and arranged neatly, without any damage. At that time, Chen (Shifa) did not know what they were, so he picked them all up and took them home. Later, they were all sold at low prices. After Chen told people about the shape of the items he picked up that day, they determined that the items were ancient tripods, dishes, and ewers. Chen could not name them, let alone know that they were invaluable treasures related to history and culture. After the county government learned about it, it dispatched Wei Xihong and Bian Qiushui, section chiefs of the Fifth Section (formerly the County Education Bureau), to investigate in the countryside. It was confirmed that the antiquities had been sold and were no longer in Chen's possession. According to Section Chief Wei (Xihong), there were fourteen pieces of ancient objects. Chen Zhonghai, the township chief of the Eighth Township, reported to the county government that there were four pieces. After Chairman (Han Fuju) learned about it, he ordered the county to cooperate with Wang Xiantang, the director of the Provincial Library, Zhang Shushen, a candidate official from the Provincial Government, and Liu Xianting, the director of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, who were sent by the Provincial Government, and bring the township chief to handle the matter. According to the order, Chen Zhonghai reported that there were eleven pieces. In short, the exact number of ancient objects is currently being investigated, and there is no talk of how to preserve them in the future. Director Wang (Xiantang), Director Liu (Xianting), and candidate official Zhang (Shushen) are currently staying at Fuxinggong General Merchandise Store in the city. It is said that they have gone to the countryside today. The reporter then copied the original text of Chairman Han's instruction and left.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Han Fuju's Instruction <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>To issue an order: It is recently reported by Chen Zhonghai, the township chief of the Eighth Township in the county, that a farmer named Chen in Anshang Village in the district has obtained eleven pieces of antiquities and requests that officials be sent to escort them all to the province for disposal. In addition to the separate order, Zhang Shushen, a candidate official from the Provincial Government, Liu Xianting, the director of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, and Wang Xiantang, the director of the Provincial Library, are specially dispatched to bring the township chief Chen Zhonghai to cooperate with the county magistrate in handling the matter. The county magistrate should immediately comply with the order and report the situation for review. This order.</p>
<p>At this time, it was already 9 p.m., and the weather was cloudy with occasional rain. The reporter originally intended to continue the investigation, but it was too late, and it was the first time in this place, unfamiliar with both people and the area. Therefore, the reporter decided to work tomorrow and decided to first visit the committee members sent by the province to find out the whereabouts of the antiquities and then visit them. Despite the rain, the reporter set out, although the streets were repaired with roads (the section from the station to the west city gate), they were too narrow and pedestrians trampled them back and forth, resulting in a mixture of mud and water, which could reach the ankles. The reporter could not help but secretly say, "This is truly (impossible to walk, brother)". After entering the city, the road was paved with stones, which was not very wide either. At eight o'clock, the reporter arrived at Fuxinggong General Merchandise Store. The store clerk told the reporter that the Wang committee members had just gone to the county government and might not have arrived yet. The reporter then rushed to the county government and submitted a card to request an audience with County Magistrate Cui and Director Wang, etc. (the county people generally call Wang, etc. as committee members). County Magistrate Cui (Gongfu) received the reporter and introduced the reporter to Wang, etc. After a few words of greeting, County Magistrate (Gongfu) led the way to see the antiquities. The antiquities were transported from the township and stored in the outer room of the county magistrate's office. At that time, there were many local gentry and students watching. Upon closer inspection, there were eleven pieces of tripods, yi, qiao (percussion instrument), [missing text], etc., all covered with green rust. When tapped, they made a clear sound, and they were indeed not modern objects. At that time, Chen Zhonghai, the township chief of the Eighth Township, was also present and asked about the location where the antiquities were discovered. The township chief hesitated and could not speak, so Liu Xianting, the director of the Jinan Municipal Women's Vocational Training Institute, spoke on his behalf. It was then learned that the antiquities were discovered</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Location Where Antiquities Appeared <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Is located about a li north of Anshang Village, commonly known as Tutuding, bordering Taoshan to the west and Shaji River to the east, covering an area of about three mu. The terrain is elevated like a mound. The surrounding area is yellow soil, but the middle is gray. According to general speculation, it is an ancient tomb for many years. I don't know how many vicissitudes have caused such a change. The landlord here belongs to the Chen family, cultivated by Chen Shifa and Chen Shifu brothers for generations. On the seventeenth day of the lunar calendar of this year, because there was a ditch in the land, they went to level it in order to plant. Accidentally, they dug out a pot-shaped metal fragment. After digging down more than two feet, they found antiquities. Chen transported them to his home. Later, the villagers all knew about it, and some even went to dig secretly at night. Now, thanks to the official's efforts to preserve them, the following numbers have been obtained.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Number of Antiquities <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Including one tripod, one dish, one yi, [missing text], and ge (cooking pot), four each. There are also six kinds of parts, all attached to ancient objects, totaling seventeen pieces in size. One of the four [missing text] has words on the bottom, which are in seal script, but they are blurred and almost unrecognizable. With the best of eyesight, only one "Meng" character and the four characters "zi sun yong yong" (may descendants use forever) in the last line can be vaguely identified. As for whether there are any words on other antiquities, it is currently unknown because of the soil rust covering them. According to the director of the Provincial Library</p>
<h3 id="e83">Wang Xiantang's Appraisal <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xiantang determined that these antiquities were from the Zhou Dynasty. Wang also said that when the antiquities were first discovered, there were fish bones and animal teeth (like cow teeth) in the tripod, and there were also fragments of tiles and mussel shells beside it. Because the villagers were ignorant, they have all been discarded. If these items existed, they could be identified as from the Western Zhou Dynasty, because shells were used as currency during the Zhou Dynasty. As for</p>
<h3 id="e84">The Disposal of Antiquities <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the disposal of antiquities, the committee members Zhang Shushen, Liu Xianting, Wang Xiantang, and County Magistrate Cui Gongfu, who were sent by the provincial government, decided at that time to first take a photo to keep as a souvenir, and then pack them in boxes and transport them to Jinan, and then determine the location for preservation. At the same time, the committee members and County Magistrate Cui will jointly draft a memorial to report to Chairman Han. At that time, Section Chief Wei (Xihong) had a temporary exhibition so that the people of the county could have a considerable understanding of the antiquities. Because they were in a hurry to nail the boxes and transport them to the province, it could not be realized. So, they took a photo in the second hall of the county government and divided them into two wooden boxes (used to hold matches). Wang Xiantang personally placed them, and County Magistrate Cui Gongfu and Fifth Section Chief Wei Xihong, etc., were all on-site to supervise. After the installation was completed, three seals were vertically and horizontally pasted on the bottom cover of each wooden box, and they will be shipped to Jinan tomorrow (the 7th).</p>
<h3 id="e85">Wei Xihong's Statement <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Wei Xihong, the chief of the Fifth Section, said that at the end of last month, he received a report from a villager saying that farmers named Chen in Anshang Village had discovered many kinds of antiquities, and antique dealers from Jinan were willing to pay 2,000 yuan to buy them, and they were currently discussing the price. He believed that since antique dealers had come from afar and were willing to pay a high price to buy these antiquities, they must have their value and history. Moreover, the current Teng County is the ancient State of Teng, and it is adjacent to the birthplace of the two great sages of our country, Confucius and Mencius (Qufu and Zou County), and its relationship in history and culture is very important and great. He decided not to let them be lost. So, on the one hand, in the name of an education inspector, he telegraphed to Director He Siyuan, and on the other hand, in the name of the chief of the Fifth Section, he signed a report to the county magistrate of this county (Cui Gongfu). Soon, Director He replied to the county by telegram, ordering him to properly preserve them to prevent them from being lost. At the same time, Li Shuchun, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, also sent a telegram to the county. County Magistrate Cui of this county then sent him and Bian Qiushui, the dispatch director of the county government, Li Shichen, the county school supervisor, Xu Zhongshan, a staff member of the public education center, and Zhu Chuanzhe, the district chief of the Second District, to investigate. He and others went together on the first day of this month. After meeting with Chen Zhonghai, the township chief of the Second Township, and Chen Shifa and Chen Shifu, the brothers who excavated the antiquities, he explained the purpose of the visit. However, the villagers were ignorant and afraid that the government would confiscate them, so they did not offer the antiquities and said that they had already been sold. When asked for the names of the buyers, they said they did not know. The final result on that day was that Chen Zhonghai, the township chief of the Eighth Township, made a guarantee that he would collect the antiquities the next day and would not allow them to be sold. The second time the county magistrate sent people to the countryside to transport the antiquities, Chen Zhonghai, the township chief, and the Chen brothers all avoided meeting them. When Chairman Han learned about it in the province, he asked Liu Xianting, the current director of the Jinan Municipal Women's Vocational Training Institute, because Director Liu was from Teng County and was also a neighbor of the Chen family. Director Liu then sent a letter from Jinan to Chen Zhonghai, summoning him to the province to meet Chairman Han. After Chen Zhonghai arrived in the province and met Chairman Han, he was willing to send the antiquities to the province for preservation. After Chen returned to the county from the province, he did not fully deliver all seventeen antiquities, large and small, to the county government until yesterday (the 5th).</p>

<p>Wei Xihong, the chief of the Fifth Section of Teng County, and Zhu Chuanzhe, the district chief of the Second District, signed a report to the county magistrate after the investigation, saying that it was about signing a report. In the case of discovering antiquities in Anshang Village in the east of the city, in accordance with your hand instructions, they immediately went to verify on the 1st of this month. It is now found that the location where the antiquities were discovered is about a li north of the village, connecting Taoshan to the west and adjacent to the Shaji River to the east. The land is high, covering more than one mu. The surrounding area is yellow soil. The place where the antiquities were excavated is in the center of the land. The soil is loose and gray, which is obviously an ancient tomb. Due to the long years, the lime has changed. The landowners of this land are the Chen Shifu and Chen Shifa brothers, who are both old and make a living by selling tofu and bean sprouts. On the seventeenth day of the lunar calendar, because of the padding of the moat, they dug out the antiquities. When asked the township chief of the township, Chen Zhonghai, he hesitated (only) to say that he dug out two or three pieces. After asking Chen Shifa, he said that he dug out six or seven pieces, and said that he had already sold them. When asked for the name of the buyer, he said he didn't know. After many inquiries, the villagers and neighboring villagers all said that they had unearthed fourteen antiquities, including two tripods (each tripod weighs 18 and a half kilograms with thirty-four characters on the bottom), one copper plate (with words on the bottom), two copper bottles, four incense burners, one copper ladle (tiger head shape), and four copper pots. Only the tripod is green, and the rest are black. When struck, they all make a clear sound, and they are indeed ancient objects. It is said that Chen hid the antiquities in various places one day after he obtained them, and kept them secret. Moreover, he is frivolous and ignorant and has no preconceived notions. How to sell them depends on the township chief, Chen Zhonghai. He explained to the township chief, Chen Zhonghai, and the excavator the intention to investigate and persuaded them to take them out for examination. After repeated persuasion, he agreed to make a guarantee and allow the four excavated antiquities to be handed over the next day, etc. For this reason, the details of the process should be signed and reported together.

<p>I recently read your newspaper's report on April 8th about "Suppressing Yu Hang Native Tobacco," which stated, "After the first riot in Yu Hang, the Construction Bureau sent Zhang Fancun, a section chief, and others to investigate. The villagers, upon hearing that the provincial officials had arrived, blocked the road and knelt down, begging for a temporary suspension of the suppression, causing Zhang's car to suddenly speed away, injuring many villagers. The villagers, feeling that they were not getting what they wanted, continued to riot on the 5th and 6th," which is quite shocking. This bureau previously instructed the county magistrate of Yu Hang County to convene local gentry to a meeting to thoroughly explain the matter of suppressing native tobacco, and also sent Jiang Jiamei, a secretary of this bureau, and Zhang Fancun, a section chief, to attend the meeting. After the meeting, they returned to Hang Zhou. Although there were many farmers gathered on both sides of the bus station, there were no conflicts. Moreover, at that time, a large bus led the way, and Secretary Jiang and Section Chief Zhang were in a small car, following behind. Since the small car was closely following the large car, how could it speed up and rush forward, injuring the farmers? Your newspaper's report is based on false rumors. Furthermore, this bureau sent Secretary Jiang and others to the county for a meeting on March 30th, while the second riot occurred on April 5th, five days apart, which has nothing to do with the section chief and others. This news report is feared to be a propaganda by those who mistakenly believe in other actors. A special letter is sent to solemnly declare this, hoping that you will investigate and correct it to avoid misunderstandings. Sincerely, the Construction Bureau of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, April 8th.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Preface to the Special Issue of the National Railway Line Product Exhibition by Gu Mengyu <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The National Railway Line Product Exhibition, after nine months of preparation, has opened today. Its important significance lies in several things. The principle of national economy lies in adjusting surpluses and deficits, considering what is available and what is not, distributing them in a balanced way, and ensuring that supply and demand can meet. This is the principle of national economy and also the principle of commerce. The purpose of this exhibition is to enable the production areas and the sales areas to communicate with each other, to adjust the surplus and shortage of production in various places, to enable people to understand the products and output along the national railway lines, as well as the transportation methods, and to enable business operators to have accurate statistics and detailed budgets, so as to incorporate their operations into rationalization, and the national economy can gradually develop in a balanced way. This is the primary meaning of this exhibition. The relationship between railway undertakings and industry and commerce is mutually causal. Railways can promote the development of industry and commerce, and the railways themselves also rely on the development of industry and commerce to become more prosperous. Now, agriculture, industry, commerce, and mining are declining day by day, and the railway business is also declining day by day. For the sake of revitalizing the railway business, we must support agriculture, industry, commerce, and mining to seek the simultaneous prosperity of branches and trunks. This is another meaning of this exhibition. With our country's vast land and abundant resources, and large population, all industrial and commercial undertakings are declining to this extreme. The economic aggression of imperialism is a heavy blow, but the government's failure to fulfill its advocacy ability and responsibility is also one of the main reasons. The purpose of this exhibition is to arouse the attention and interest of the majority of people, so that the quantity of production, the scope of sales, and the calculation of transportation can have accurate statistics, as a reliable reference for operators, so that the unproductive speculative undertakings in the city can gradually turn into legitimate industrial and commercial investments. This is the third meaning of this exhibition.</p>
<p>The four borders are in danger, and the flames of war are raging. We are shocked by the urgency of the national crisis and believe that the basic work of enriching national power cannot be delayed. Although there are many aspects of this kind of work, the common goal should be to seek social stability and economic development, so as to increase the national production capacity. Only when internal strength is abundant can we talk about resisting foreign aggression. This is also the intention of this exhibition to actively prepare for the opening during this critical period. The storm is dark, and the rooster crows endlessly. Work hard to cultivate the fields, and look forward to it. April 10, 1933.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Developing People's Productivity by Wang Zhaoti <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<h3 id="e99">Inaugural Address by Yu Tan <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Our country's great illness is only weakness and poverty, and poverty is the root cause of accumulated weakness. Therefore, when we talk about saving the country today, we should increase national wealth as an urgent task. And there is no other way to increase national wealth than to revitalize industry and develop the people's productivity. This is a very clear principle and does not need to be explained in detail. However, the revitalization of industry must rely on transportation, especially railway transportation. In terms of industry, it is necessary to seek a rich source of raw materials and cheap purchase prices, and a wide sales route for manufactured products and high selling prices. A rich source and a wide sales route must rely on the convenience of transportation, and cheap purchase prices and high selling prices must rely on low freight rates. In terms of commerce, it is necessary to seek a wide variety of goods for sale and large sales volume. A wide variety depends on the convenience of transportation, and large sales volume depends on low freight rates. In terms of agriculture, mining, and forestry, it is necessary to seek a wide sales route and high selling prices. A wide sales route also depends on the convenience of transportation, and high selling prices also depend on low freight rates. Therefore, it is very clear that industry relies on transportation. Modern transportation facilities include airplanes, automobiles, ships, and railways. Airplanes are only limited to transporting a small number of passengers and light mail, and automobiles are only convenient for short-distance light transportation. As for long-distance bulk goods, ships and railways are the main means of transportation. However, ships may be prevented by winter ice or wind and rain, and cannot operate accurately all year round. Their speed is also far inferior to that of railways. Moreover, the land of a country has limited navigable areas, which is not as far-reaching as railways. Therefore, there is no doubt that railways occupy the most important position in modern transportation facilities. This is why the Premier said that transportation is the mother of industry, and railways are the mother of transportation. Industry relies on railways, and railways also rely on industry. Railway business can be roughly divided into passenger transport and freight transport. In terms of business revenue, except for a very small number of lines, freight transport is actually more important than passenger transport. To develop railway business, neither of the two can be neglected. However, since railways are mainly engaged in freight transport, the quantity of freight transport can affect the prosperity of railway business. And the quantity of freight transport will naturally change with the rise and fall of agriculture, industry, mining, forestry, and other industries along the line. Moreover, when freight transport is flourishing, passenger transport will also increase accordingly. Therefore, the prosperity of railways also depends on the development of industry. The relationship between industry and railways is like that between lips and teeth, as mentioned above. Therefore, it can be seen that developing railways must promote industry, and promoting industry is developing railways. Examining the historical relationship between railways and industry in Europe and the United States, American industry was developed by the convenience of railways, while European railways were promoted by the prosperity of industry. Their mutual relationship is like this. Our country's industry and railways are both in their infancy and should be developed separately, but it is especially important to cooperate to seek common prosperity. This exhibition of railway line products organized by this ministry from the position of railways is based on this purpose. The purpose of this ministry in organizing the exhibition is to promote the development of railways and industry, and it is also believed that this exhibition is the most effective method to achieve this goal. Because our country's railways and industry are underdeveloped, the country's production cannot be used to adjust surpluses and deficits and balance supply and demand. Often, what is discarded in this place is what is urgently needed in that place. This place has a surplus of domestic products, while that place uses similar foreign goods, causing raw materials to be discarded, industry to decline, and railway business to be depressed. This exhibition gathers various kinds of goods from along the railway line in one room, clearly marking their place of origin, sales location, freight rate, etc. Visitors can distinguish the quality of the goods and understand the various related situations. Then, the surplus goods can be sold to the areas where they are needed. In the areas where there is a surplus, the prices must be low, and in the areas where there is a need, the prices must be high. This one transfer not only allows the raw materials to be used, supply and demand to be balanced, but also allows the operators to make a profit. For the sake of opening up, it directly develops agriculture, industry, commerce, mining, forestry, and other industries, and indirectly develops railway business. This association began preparations in the spring of last year. The ministry sent documents to the national railways and the governments of various provinces and cities along the line, and sent letters to various agricultural, industrial, and commercial organizations to collect products. It took half a year to complete the preparations. The collected items can be roughly divided into seven categories: agricultural products, forest products, mineral products, aquatic products, handicrafts, poultry, and medicinal materials, totaling more than 10,000 varieties. Although most of them are familiar to us, and there are no rare treasures or exquisite crafts to dazzle the audience, they are all the daily necessities of the Chinese people. This also focuses on practical people's livelihood. This association adopts the method of roving exhibition, and plans to hold meetings in various places along the national railway in turn, so as to deeply imprint this miniature of the crystallization of the national industry in the minds of people from all walks of life, so as to achieve the effect of advertising and avoid the disadvantages of being too heavy. Although the exhibition in Shanghai is temporary, it is hoped that the audience from all walks of life will be very extravagant. Because this association itself only has methods and ways to develop industry and railways, if it wants to achieve its specific realization, so as to achieve this goal, on the ministry's side, it should devote itself to the full convenience of transportation, the lowest possible freight rates, and the active construction of new roads. On the audience's side, it must also occupy its own position and make the greatest efforts in various industries, so that the division of labor and cooperation can be mutually beneficial, and industry and railways can be developed simultaneously, and the country can be transformed from poverty to wealth and from weakness to strength. This is what I sincerely welcome you to visit, and what I wish to pray for before all of you. The demand for goods is mostly time-sensitive. If it cannot be supplied in time during the time of demand, the effect of corresponding supply and demand will be lost. As a result, it will also affect the development of industry and commerce. Railway freight is an element that constitutes the market price of goods. The railway's great long-distance transportation capacity is the most effective tool for promoting the sales of goods. Its convenient and rapid transportation is a feature that meets the time-sensitive needs of goods. Therefore, railway transportation has the inherent ability to influence industry and commerce. If we can fully and properly use the inherent ability of railway transportation, then the development of industry and commerce can be expected day by day. However, for decades, our railways have not fully expressed their inherent ability, and the industrial and commercial sectors have not fully utilized the inherent ability of railways to seek the development of industry and commerce. Therefore, the phenomenon of today's industrial and commercial stagnation and backward production has formed. The National Railway Line Product Exhibition held by the Ministry of Railways this time is a strategy to solve this problem. Therefore, this exhibition is very worthy of our attention. It has special characteristics and special value. Since it is standing on the position of railways to seek industry and commerce, this is a manifestation of the railway serving the people.</p>

<p>Because of backward production in our country, people's livelihoods are deteriorating, and the national social economy is becoming increasingly difficult. It is almost that the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted, and there is a trend of national bankruptcy. The reasons for the backward production are indeed diverse, but the stagnation of industry and commerce is the biggest reason for the backward production. Because our industry and commerce are not prosperous, they are not enough to compete with other countries. Not only can the goods we produce not be sold to other countries, but also the position of the goods we produce in our own domestic market is occupied by foreign goods. Almost the entire country has become a market for foreign goods. Our own production has no foothold, and the result is naturally a trend of decline. The more our production declines, the more the power of foreign goods to invade expands. If this continues, how can we not go bankrupt? Therefore, if we want to solve the people's livelihood and develop the national social economy, we must find ways to increase our production. If we want to increase our production, we must find ways to develop our industry and commerce. Although there are many main strategies for developing our industry and commerce, the most powerful way to develop industry and commerce is railway transportation. If we can use railway transportation to regulate the production and sales and supply and demand of goods, and use railway transportation to encourage the enterprising spirit of industrialists and businessmen, our industry and commerce will naturally have considerable progress. Because railway transportation has the inherent ability to develop industry and commerce, it is closely related to industry and commerce. Whether or not industry and commerce can develop depends on whether the supply and demand of goods can correspond. Whether or not the supply and demand can correspond includes several related conditions: (1) The cost of goods The cost of goods is related to the ability to purchase. If the cost of goods is too high, the selling price must be expensive. If the selling price exceeds the general ability to purchase, the goods will not be able to be sold. As a result, supply and demand cannot correspond. If supply and demand cannot correspond, industry and commerce will have no hope of development. (2) The sales market of goods The sales market of goods is related to the production of goods. If the sales market cannot be promoted, the production must not be increased. If the production cannot be increased, it must</p>
<p>If the supply does not meet the demand, the result is that industry and commerce also have no hope of development (3) External view of the railway exhibition</p>
<p>The development of the industry, in order to promote the increase in production, then its role is naturally different from ordinary general exhibitions. Ordinary general exhibitions are mostly only in the passive aspect of observation, comparing their effects, only can make people get a sense of good and bad and impression, as to how to apply the feeling to the actual situation, in the general exhibition itself, there is no ability to promote this second step of work, so general exhibitions, can receive real effect is very few, the Ministry of Railways National Railway Line Production Goods Exhibition, on the one hand, is by means of goods exhibition to enable the audience to have a considerable understanding of the production and sales situation of various goods within the scope of the national railway transportation, so that they have a considerable standard for managing industrial and commercial industries, so that they know how to use railway transportation to make the tool of managing industrial and commercial industries, so that they know that the relationship between industrial and commercial industries and railway transportation is close, and there is a need to cooperate with railways, on the other hand, is by means of the exhibition of goods, to explore the real situation of goods production and sales, and the true situation of supply and demand, how to make the railway transportation strategy suitable for the needs of industrialists and businessmen, in order to promote the increase of production, not only in the passive aspect of observation comparison, in other words, the Ministry of Railways National Railway Line Production Goods Exhibition, is the medium of cooperation between railways and industrialists and businessmen, is the railway and industrial and commercial enterprises to jointly develop the various industries of society and promote the production of tools to solve people's livelihood, so this exhibition, is not only a separate exhibition organization but also has the organic body of promoting the industrial and commercial development of the strength, this is his unique characteristics and values, then his future harvest, is naturally not the general exhibition can be compared,</p>
<p>The land and products are suitable for each other, and life is used daily. All needs to communicate the existence of the land and supply the needs of life. The cart thousands of miles has been so since ancient times. The setting of this meeting is exactly the film exhibition, high transportation, and regulation of the national economy.</p>

<p>Today, the Railway Line Production Goods Exhibition is held in Shanghai, its rich goods, exquisite display, and the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life to help, the grand occasion of the visit, can be imagined, I think that China is known as a vast land and abundant resources, but fish and salt are produced in rivers and lakes, timber is rich in mountains and forests, trade is not, railways are still, to examine the Premier's industrial plan, China's railways need to reach 100,000 miles, the good land is vast, this is not enough to supply the needs, with this small amount of goods along each road, compared with the national goods, since it is also very small, but to see the listed goods along the line, I feel that it is a dazzling array, then the national goods, why not be erudite, we observe the abundance of goods along the railway line, we are aware of the heavy responsibility of the past and future transportation, so that the engineering construction, strive to be solid, the machine equipment, strive to be perfect, so that the goods along the line of the completed roads, can run smoothly, without any obstacles, but also think of the areas where the railways have not been built, the goods must be transported urgently, work together, start construction and repair, hope that the national goods, want to go, want to stop, time economy, both no empty waste, and farmers, industry and commerce, can also be aware of the richness of heaven, the needs of the times, work hard, do their best to operate, so the railway relies on goods to nourish, goods rely on the railway to sell, cause and effect are still, mutual development, so that the vast land and abundant resources of the country, the world is called the hero, then the success of this railway line production goods exhibition is not very great,</p>

<p>The treasury is empty, Si Nong looks up to the stars, and the speakers attribute it to the unrest in the place and the disturbances of disasters, and in fact it is in the stagnation of the industry, which is a major reason for the poverty and weakness of our country, which is solid for everyone, and to study its reasons, it is originally due to the uneven distribution of production, the imbalance of supply and demand, the income of the national railway, and also affected by it, and it is difficult to have the hope of continuing to increase, the parties concerned are worried about it, planning to increase the transportation of commercial goods, the development of the national economy, there is the organization of the National Railway Line Production Goods Exhibition, roving exhibition, so that the general merchants and people in major cities, clearly understand the production of each road, as well as the transportation methods, and the standards of assessing the surplus and reducing the deficit, from observation to seek improvement, because of the collection and know the mining and transportation, the needs distribution, no surplus and lack of worry, and to collect the mutual benefit effect, and things are small and big, must have the courage to be brave, enterprising, self-improvement of the perseverance, and then have a good effect, the backwardness of our country's agriculture, industry and commerce, there is no denying it, what is the reason, from which to start the machine, the things that are relied upon by the imported goods, the grandness of the abyss, it is really painful, and the fruits of the national product are lacking, and the fruits are not enough foreign goods to apply, then it is also ears, Gu Shi one look at its origin, about the needs of society, then the raw materials may not be lacking, the national product is not exhausted enough to apply, and must sit and watch the monopoly dumping of foreigners, knock the essence and absorb the marrow, daily, in the desolate township, it is solid due to blind obedience half, and also by no combination, no view, no need, and the distribution of supply, there is to cause it, especially in the progress, although the government said to promote national products every day, the people do not help it with group power, and there is no shield behind it, so although there is the establishment of exhibitions and other meetings, the general people, every view is a place for sightseeing, I have never heard of this and arouse feelings, work hard in the progress, and fight with the powers of industrial and commercial industry, Yu Qiang on the earth, with the land of China, and there is a status quo, this is deeply painful, I deeply hope that the people of the country in the opening of the exhibition, for the cargo quantity of the calling road line, and the needs of various places, as well as the convenience of trade and migration, add a deep understanding, precision and detailed, how to promote the benefits, how to improve and do not wait for external requirements, do not make the hard-working national railway line production goods exhibition, regarded as an ordinary sightseeing place, I hope that the authorities will not bear the hard work of promotion,</p>

<h3 id="e106">The Significance of the Railway Goods Exhibition by Chen Yaozu <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The establishment of railways in our country began in the late Qing Dynasty. In recent times, due to various influences such as political and military affairs, while there has been no significant progress, railways have their own missions and achievements in facilitating transportation and promoting cultural exchange. Therefore, industries such as agriculture, commerce, mining, etc., along the railway lines have made rapid progress in recent decades. However, the people of our country are limited in their knowledge and have not had the opportunity to examine them in detail. Although they talk about promoting domestic goods and resisting foreign goods, they do not know the source and quantity of domestic goods, nor the ways to promote and encourage them. As a result, goods are abandoned on the ground, people are idle, and national economy and people's livelihood are merely empty words, which is lamentable. This time, the Ministry of Railways has spent months collecting products from various railway lines across the country and exhibiting them publicly in a rotating manner for observation and inspection. By juxtaposing the good and the bad, people will know to encourage themselves. By displaying a variety of goods, buyers will be able to find supplies. This will make the people of our country realize that our nation is rich in resources and that it is not necessary to rely on imported goods to satisfy our needs for clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Its benefits to the national economy and people's livelihood are immeasurable. Furthermore, the exhibits this time include many agricultural and industrial products from the railway lines that have not been seen or heard of by the people of our country. The precision of their manufacturing and the abundance of their production are particularly unexpected. After this introduction, they will soon spread far and wide, selling well throughout the country along the railway tracks. Not only will farmers, merchants, and industrialists benefit, but railway transportation will also greatly increase. Therefore, I am happy to say a few words about it.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Photographs of Colleagues at the Railway Exhibition <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The facilities are already in place. As for its operation, there is no possibility of exclusive control. Whether it is passenger or freight transport, all ships, sailboats, automobiles, carts, airplanes, and even cattle, horses, livestock, and all means of transportation can freely compete with trains. Therefore, railway operators, if they do not surpass other means of transportation in terms of speed, price, and service, will find it difficult to succeed. The operating methods of railway operators in our country are often passive, waiting for customers to come to their door, and yet they still have an unwelcoming attitude. Their arrogance is like corrupt officials and petty bureaucrats, and their extortion is like local tyrants and evil gentry. Therefore, merchants have no choice but to trade with trains and have to endure this unpleasantness. Moreover, in terms of transportation trends, highway construction is advancing rapidly, and long-distance buses are popular, so land transportation is sufficient to compete with trains. The abolition of likin and the removal of some restrictions on water transportation have led to the increasing prosperity of the shipping industry, so water transportation is also sufficient to compete with trains. The gradual expansion of aviation facilities means that air transportation is also sufficient to compete with trains. Therefore, it has been said that if railways want to maintain a considerable position in transportation in the future, they must strive to improve their own facilities and efficiency, and eliminate the arrogance of employees, as well as corrupt behavior. Furthermore, they must change their operating methods from a passive to an active position, and use various methods to attract customers widely. Otherwise, failure is inevitable. The Ministry of Railways' holding of a national railway line product exhibition has many implications, but it is undoubtedly one of the active operating methods. I hereby announce this to my railway colleagues on the opening day.</p>

<p>The primary task of railways is freight transport. To ensure smooth freight transport, detailed investigation and clear records of products along the railway lines, as well as various efforts to promote and publicize them, are essential. This is why various countries have railway line product exhibitions. The significance of the exhibition lies in clearly understanding the location, quality, quantity, and value of goods produced in various places, comparing and observing them, and knowing the quality and quantity of the products, so that the dispatch and allocation of vehicles can be properly considered. Its benefits are by no means small. Therefore, through the establishment of this conference, the products along the line can be gradually improved, and the freight transport of each road can be fully developed. Now, on the tenth day of the month, the Ministry will hold an exhibition in Shanghai. A special publication will be issued in advance. I hereby contribute a few words to wish our country's products and freight transport to reach a prosperous and developed state. Is this not a beautiful thing? Respectful wishes from Zhang Jingli of Haining.</p>

<p>Held in the Grand Auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>More than 5,000 enthusiastic participants</p>
<p>The National Goods Movement Rally initiated by the First Special District Citizens' Federation was held in the Grand Auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce at 1:00 PM yesterday. Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Wu, advocating for national goods. Various entertainers performed voluntarily. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e118">Attending Representatives <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Those who participated yesterday included Mayor Wu Tiecheng (represented by Pan Gongzhan), Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, Public Security Bureau Director Wen Hongen, Garrison Commander Dai Ji (represented by Zheng Lefu), Gu Xinyi of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, Chu Huiseng of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association, Hu Xiyuan, Yuan Hongjun of the City Chamber of Commerce, and Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Yichen, Wang Hanliang, Chen Binghui, Liu Zhongying, Tao Leqin, Zhu Yangwu, and others from the district branches of the Citizens' Federation, as well as more than 5,000 men and women from all walks of life. Wang Hanliang, Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Yichen, Chen Binghui, Liu Zhongying, and Zhu Yangwu were elected as the presidium. (Photo taken by Zhonghua Photo Studio)</p>
<h3 id="e119">Chairman's Report <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>After the meeting began with formalities, Wang Hanliang delivered a report on the opening remarks, roughly saying that today is the Citizens' Federation's National Goods Advocacy Propaganda Meeting, and many guests have come to the meeting. The purpose is that Chinese people should buy Chinese goods. As a member of the people of Shanghai, I hope that all the people of Shanghai will rise up to save the country. Although we cannot personally go to the front to kill the enemy, those in the rear should work hard to promote national goods, use Chinese money to buy Chinese goods, which is my only hope. Some people say that if there are no Japanese goods on the market, then they will not buy Japanese goods. In fact, we should not buy them regardless of whether they are available or not. I hope that all the people of Shanghai will promote national goods. The country is about to perish, but the people are still not aware of it, which is really very heartbreaking. Finally, I hope that the compatriots present will not buy foreign goods and work hard to promote national goods. The country is now about to perish, but the people are still not aware of it, which is really very heartbreaking. In the end, I hope that the compatriots present will not buy foreign goods and work hard to promote national goods.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Original Text of the Oath <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The entire body swore to use national goods, saying: "I solemnly swear that from this day forward, I will absolutely use national goods, promote national goods, and publicize national goods, and will not buy or sell enemy goods. If I violate this oath, I am willing to be subjected to the most severe punishment by the citizens. Solemnly sworn, April 9, 1933."</p>
<h3 id="e121">Excerpts from Speeches <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>(1) The speech by Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, representative of the Municipal Government, stated: "At this time of national crisis, it is still necessary to promote national goods, which is embarrassing to say. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that our country spends 200 million yuan on foreign goods every year, but after checking the customs records, it was already 600 million taels last year. Therefore, our country's money is getting less and less, and the people are getting poorer and poorer. So, how does this phenomenon occur? The responsibility should be borne by three aspects: (A) Manufacturing factories cannot concentrate their efforts to achieve large-scale production, fail to cooperate, and compete with each other, cutting corners, and as a result, they all perish and cannot stand on their own. If this shortcoming can be corrected, production can be increased, quality can be improved, prices can be lowered, and cooperation can be strengthened to seek progress together. If we can first be self-sufficient, then foreign goods will not be able to resist self-made goods. (B) Merchants do not know how to love the country and do not take the 'September 18th' and 'January 28th' incidents to heart, only knowing how to seek personal gain, not hesitating to change their appearance and steal and plunder skillfully. It must be known that Japan's destruction in Shanghai was originally intended to suppress our resistance movement against Japanese goods. Some unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to rise up and acted without restraint. But can the patriotic spirit of all our citizens be suppressed by them? This year is the Year of National Goods, and people with good intentions in the business community are also working hard, such as the China National Goods Company and the Shanghai National Goods Company, which are gradually increasing. If Shanghai is like this and other places follow suit, then national goods will surely have a day of victory. (C) Citizens themselves, if they recognize enemy goods and are determined not to buy them, then unscrupulous merchants will be helpless. I have heard that merchants selling Japanese goods often say that if we do not sell Japanese goods, we cannot live. It can be seen that there are still quite a few people who buy Japanese goods. If everyone takes pride in using national goods and shame in mistakenly buying enemy goods, then it will not be difficult to eliminate foreign goods. Otherwise, without the Japanese destroying our country, our country itself will not be able to stand on its own." (2) Chu Huiseng said, "Director Pan just mentioned that the annual import surplus is 600 million, which is still the customs tael figure. If converted into silver dollars, it would be 900 million. Money is the lifeblood of the country. If all the money flows out, how will the people of our country survive? Therefore, using national goods is the natural responsibility of the people, and women should pay special attention, otherwise, they will not be willing to be slaves of a conquered country." (3) Wang Jiean said, "To defeat Japan, there is only the word 'resistance'. The people of the whole country should arm themselves, which is resistance. Absolutely not buying or selling Japanese goods is resistance. Doing our best to produce is resistance. I hope everyone will unite and resist."</p>

<h3 id="e128">The True Meaning of the Railway Exhibition <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yu Yan, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, received the press at the Zhonghua Juyi Society at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. Director Yu first stood up and reported, followed by President Li Zhaohuan of Jiaotong University who delivered a speech. Director Yu reported that the true meaning of this railway exhibition is to display samples of products produced along the national railway lines for the general industrial and commercial circles to view. The comparison of these samples, as well as the value, freight, origin, sales market, seasons, transportation methods, taxes, and other issues, are all issues that general merchants want to solve in their minds. This association has specially made a simple report on its findings to provide merchants with research and reference for purchasing goods. This is the intention of this railway exhibition. The products produced along the railway lines are mostly domestic goods necessary for the daily life of the general public, such as agricultural products, mineral products, and industrial products, which are all goods transported by railways. According to the statistics of 1931, mineral products accounted for more than 13 million tons, accounting for 55.48% of the total national freight transport, followed by agricultural products, accounting for more than 5.2 million tons, accounting for 22.19% of the total national freight transport, and then industrial products, accounting for more than 3.5 million tons, accounting for 15.22% of the total national freight transport. These goods are transported to the market or destination by railway, and although the quantity is large, they are all very common rice, flour, cotton, medicinal materials, coal, coke, and other daily necessities. However, the products produced in different places are naturally the objects that general merchants urgently hope to view in detail. In essence, the better the samples, the easier it is to expand the sales market. However, although these samples are the objects of our exhibition today, we are not taking them out to show off novelty and victory. To expand the market for domestic products along the line, we naturally cannot passively let everything go. Regardless of the quality of the samples, we should try to promote the excellent ones and let them be sold as much as possible, and we should encourage the inferior ones to find ways to improve them. This exhibition is a vanguard for the general inland production class to promote and publicize, and it can also be said to break the first difficult hurdle for the majority of manufacturers who are relatively short of capital and unable to promote their products to distant places. This is the true meaning of the railway exhibition. At the same time, due to the expansion of the sales market for domestic products, the railway's own transportation business will naturally develop accordingly. Due to the development of the railway transportation business, the national economy along the line will become more developed. This is the ultimate goal of this railway exhibition. Although the railway is a state-run enterprise, its nature is actually a business organization that purely serves the people. The goods transported by the railway are to transport the raw materials or industrial products generally needed by the people's production enterprises along the line to the market or to the industrial area, so as to maintain the balance between production, consumption, and supply on all sides, and to adjust their deficiencies. This is the responsibility of the railway. In other words, if general merchants or manufacturers are looking for a large-scale, rapid transportation method that can shorten the distance and reduce the consumption of a long time, the most convenient way is to entrust the railway to transport goods. On the railway side, it can not only be responsible for shipping, but also transport large quantities of goods at cheap freight rates. Merchants can save money, and all responsibilities can be ignored. It will be transported to you on time, without any loss or omission. This is the responsibility of the railway to general merchants. Since the railway undertakes this major responsibility, it naturally directly reduces the burden on merchants, and at the same time reduces the cost of goods, and indirectly reduces the burden on the general consuming class in terms of purchase prices. At the same time, it increases the purchasing power of the general consuming class. The result of this kind of economic connection can directly promote the prosperity of the production business and increase the power of the Republic of China. In other words, it can increase the national strength to resist the enemy. Increasing strength is the only way to save ourselves.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Customs Installs Radio Beacons on Great Xu Island <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Regular weather reports to begin on May 1</p>
<p>Hua Wu Shan Radio Beacon changes Broadcast time</p>
<p>In order to facilitate shipping, the Inspector General of Customs of Jianghai has specially added radio beacons to the Great Xu Island Lighthouse to report the weather at any time, so that ships can be prepared. In order to connect all the radio beacons, the broadcast time of the Hua Wu Shan radio beacon signal has also been changed. The two notices issued by the Maritime Section of the Jianghai Customs yesterday morning are recorded below:</p>

<p>1. Please allow the people to freely organize political parties.</p>
<p>2. Please concentrate talent and expand the central organization.</p>
<p>Li Genyuan and others telegraphed the government, saying: "For the perusal of the people of the whole country: Recently, we sent a telegram to the Central Government, which read: Chairman Lin of Nanjing, Chairman Chiang of Nanchang, President Wang of Nanjing, President Sun, President Ju, President Yu, President Dai, and the Kuomintang Central Committee and the National Government: In the past two years, we have encountered unprecedented national disasters. Although there are many reasons for this, the main reason is the one-party dictatorship, which has prevented the development of the people's intelligence. The Central Executive Committee has now moved with compassion and resolved to lift the ban on political parties and convene a national assembly ahead of schedule. Although the decision is somewhat late, it shows a sincere intention to save the country. Considering the national crisis, we dare not but express our utmost sincerity and directly state two matters: (1) Issue an immediate order allowing the people to freely organize political parties and effectively guarantee freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication so that the entire people can work together for national affairs and establish a solid foundation for constitutional government; (2) The Japanese invaders are pressing on relentlessly, and the crisis is urgent. We must catch up quickly, or it will be too late. We should immediately concentrate talent from across the country, expand</p>

<p>Suffered from heart disease after arriving in Shanghai and died despite medical treatment</p>
<p>The coffin will be transported back to Sanshui for burial this afternoon</p>
<p>His last words emphasized the people's livelihood</p>
<p>Liang Shiyi, who had long been highly regarded in the transportation and economic sectors, came to Shanghai a month ago in light of the loss of Rehe and the danger in North China, intending to go north to participate in the anti-Japanese war. After arriving in Shanghai, he suffered from heart disease and was admitted to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Recently, his condition worsened, and he passed away at 1:30 a.m. yesterday, at the age of sixty-five. The details of Liang's life and his condition during his illness are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Arrived in Shanghai Last Month <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Liang Shiyi held important positions throughout his life, but since returning to Guangdong in 1925, he had not been involved in worldly affairs, residing in Hong Kong or his ancestral home of Sanshui. It was not until the National Government convened a national crisis conference in January last year that Liang was invited and came to Shanghai. However, he happened to arrive during the January 28th Incident, so he stayed in Shanghai to assist in the anti-Japanese cause. In March, when the 19th Route Army withdrew, he returned to Guangdong. Last month, with the fall of Rehe Province and the crisis in North China, Liang felt uneasy in Hong Kong and resolutely went north again to assist the government and the anti-Japanese cause. He departed from Hong Kong on March 1st and arrived in Shanghai on March 3rd.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Treatment Process <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Liang Shiyi resided at his private residence on Haig Road, McTyeire Road. Liang caught a cold in late last month. His family intended to call a doctor for treatment, but Liang refused, saying, "We should not call a doctor for a mere cold. We</p>
<p>Liang Shiyi's posthumous portrait</p>
<p>should use a strong will to overcome the illness." Towards the end of the month, his condition gradually worsened, and his family insisted on sending him to the hospital. Liang did not strongly refuse at this point and was taken to Baolong Hospital on Meadville Road by his family on the first of this month, where he was treated by Dr. Boro, a German medical doctor. After Dr. Boro diagnosed Liang, he found that Liang's heart was enlarged and immediately gave him an injection to shrink it. On the 5th, Liang suddenly vomited two mouthfuls of fresh blood. At that time, Dr. Boro suspected a ruptured large blood vessel. On the 7th, it was proven that this was not the case and that there was accumulated blood in the stomach. Dr. Boro carefully treated him. By the 8th, his condition had greatly improved, and his family celebrated that Liang would recover. Unexpectedly, at 1:10 a.m. on the 9th, he suddenly fell into a coma and could not be saved. After Liang fell into a coma at 1:10 a.m. yesterday, he passed away at 1:30 a.m. Liang's younger brother, Shiyi, and more than ten children and relatives were by his side. Seeing his coma, they rushed to call doctors for emergency treatment, but it was too late. His family telegraphed the Universal Funeral Home to send a car to the hospital. His children transported Liang's remains to the car and returned directly to his private residence on McTyeire Road.</p>

<p>Liang's body was transported back to his private residence from Baolong Hospital and immediately given a small encoffining. The grand encoffining is scheduled for this afternoon, and the coffin will still need to be transported back to Sanshui, Guangdong, for burial. Yesterday, people from all walks of life in Shanghai and Liang's relatives and friends, upon hearing of Liang's death, visited Liang's residence to express their condolences. There were more than two hundred people, mostly from the banking and business sectors. Ye Gongchuo, the former Minister of Communications, also went to help with the funeral arrangements. Duan Qirui, who was living in seclusion in Shanghai, sent someone with a funeral gift to express his condolences. Yesterday, a shed had been erected in front of the house to prepare for the funeral in Shanghai.</p>

<p>During his illness, Liang was constantly concerned about the national crisis, saying that the nation had reached this point and that everyone must automatically work hard to find a glimmer of hope. He left his last words to his relatives and friends. The original text is recorded as follows: "The praise and criticism I have received in my life are countless, and I have never argued. I am confident that there must be someone in the world who deeply understands me. All my actions have always been in my heart. Although I am unwilling to display my achievements, the truth exists naturally. Those who comment on the world may be able to seek it in the facts. In 1911, I assisted Mr. Tang Shaoyi in supporting the Republic, and over the years, my plans and measures for foreign affairs are well known to my close friends. They are all related to historical materials, and I hope someone will record them. As for the economic and financial undertakings I created, although they are praised by the world, they are actually insignificant. I sincerely hope that colleagues in both fields can especially save the people's livelihood, otherwise, the future will be unimaginable."</p>

<p>Liang, whose courtesy name was Yansun, was sixty-five years old and from Sanshui, Guangdong. He was a Jinshi in the Jiawu year of the late Qing Dynasty. He successively served as the principal of the Ministry of Justice in the abolished Qing Dynasty. At the end of the Guangxu era, he traveled to various countries with Tang Shaoyi. After returning to China, he served as the president of the Bank of Communications. After the establishment of the Republic, he served as the secretary-general of the Presidential Office and acting Minister of Finance. When Yuan secretly proclaimed himself Emperor Hongxian, Liang was the Chief of the General Staff. After Yuan's death, Liang went abroad for many years. After returning to China, he served as the Director-General of State Affairs, Speaker of the Senate, Chairman of the Financial Rehabilitation Committee, Chairman of the Financial Reorganization Committee, and member of the Customs Special Committee. Liang had a great relationship with the country. During the abolished Qing Dynasty, he made great efforts to develop transportation and was admired by the world. He made many contributions to the financial industry. During the Guangxu era, he was appreciated by Zhang Zhidong, the Governor-General of Huguang, and made great efforts to build railways and handle foreign affairs, gradually showing his talent. Later, he followed Tang Shaoyi to Tibet to handle British-Indian foreign affairs. He then worked in the Ministry of Posts and Communications, managing postal affairs and railway affairs. He repeatedly negotiated with various countries to purchase transportation materials, which was opposed by many Chinese people at the time. Liang did not care about public opinion and resolutely did it. As a result, various countries also admired Liang's character. Later, he served as the president of the bank, the director-general of the railway, and the director of the Constitutional Preparatory Bureau. When the revolution broke out, Liang advised the Qing Emperor to abdicate. At that time, the situation was very dangerous, but Liang was still able to resolutely advocate for it, which was praised by the Chinese people. When Yuan Shikai became president, Liang served as the Secretary-General of the Presidential Office and concurrently Minister of Communications. He was later transferred to Minister of Finance. During the era of Xu Shichang and Duan Qirui, Liang served as the Prime Minister and Chairman of the Finance Committee. At that time, Liang actively reorganized the finances and strongly supported customs autonomy. When Zhang Zuolin's forces were deployed in North China, Liang suggested stopping the civil war and implementing unification. Because it could not be implemented, he angrily returned to Guangdong. During the January 28th Shanghai War, Liang worked hard in Shanghai to prepare for assistance to the anti-Japanese cause. When the 19th Route Army withdrew, Liang returned to Guangdong. Recently, due to the fall of Rehe and the danger in North China, he came to Shanghai last month. When he arrived in Shanghai, he suffered from hemoptysis. The doctor ordered him to rest, but Liang, concerned about the country, could not follow the doctor's orders and passed away.</p>
<p>large central organization, as for the military and political organs in North China near the front line, they should also be expanded and strengthened to bring into play the power of national resistance. We have repeatedly called for these two things. Now, considering that the Central Government has a new opportunity to start anew with the people, we are making our previous suggestions again to jointly save the country from danger. The government and the people have been separated for a long time. To show sincerity in the hope of achieving national unity, please begin with this. We offer our sincere words and respectfully request your consideration. We hope that compatriots across the country will rise up together, reverse this crisis, and open a new path. We sincerely hope for this.

<p>Passed away last night due to abdominal carbuncle</p>
<p>The grand encoffining is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon</p>
<p>Li Zhengwu, who was a revolutionary leader in the early years of the Republic of China, had been living in seclusion in Shanghai since his retirement. Recently, three months ago, Li suddenly suffered from stomach problems, with frequent severe pain. He immediately consulted various doctors for diagnosis and treatment, but with little effect. Since the end of last month, his condition worsened. Li decided to switch to Western medicine for treatment. Because his home was not suitable for his illness, he moved into Room 107 of the Sino-Western Sanatorium at 536 Route Paul Henry Villard on Sunday (the 2nd) of last week. He was treated by Dr. Macredie of the sanatorium, who diagnosed that the pain inside Li's body was not in the stomach but was due to a carbuncle in the lower abdomen, which could only be treated with surgery. After Li's family learned of this, they consulted Li himself and, with his consent, had the doctor perform the surgery at 8 a.m. on the 3rd. It was found that there was a considerable amount of pus in the lower abdomen, which was washed clean and sutured. The process was quite successful. However, because Li was old and his energy was insufficient, his condition suddenly changed the night before. Despite the best efforts of the doctors, it was difficult to see any effect. He passed away in the sanatorium at 9 p.m. yesterday, at the age of fifty-nine. Li's family entrusted the China Funeral Home to send a car to transport the remains back to Li's private residence at 19, Lane 52, Route Grand Occident at 10:30 p.m. that night. The grand encoffining is scheduled for 2 p.m. on the 11th. It is expected that there will be a grand funeral with plain carriages and white horses.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Huang Jintao's Speech on Building the Central Steel Plant <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>丨Relationship with Industrial and National Defense丨</p>
<p>Director Huang Jintao of the Ministry of Industry delivered a valuable speech on the relationship between the Central Steel Plant and national defense at the specialized research conference of the Jiaotong University Industrial and Iron Exhibition. His speech stated that in today's discussion of national defense construction, the manufacture of military equipment should be considered the most important element. The military equipment manufacturing industry should be based on the development of all related industries before directly producing military equipment manufacturing plants to complete the so-called industries related to military equipment manufacturing. The following can be listed: steel, coal, petroleum, steel, lead-zinc, tungsten, antimony, aluminum, sulfur, nitrate, wood, rubber, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, chemical drugs, machinery, electrical, and other eighteen kinds. The cotton, wool, and grain used for military supplies are not included. The above industries are generally referred to as military industries. Military industries do not only refer to arsenals. All industries closely related to military affairs can be referred to as military industries. Those who directly manufacture military equipment are military industries, and the production of raw materials used for manufacturing military equipment should also be referred to as military industries. Before the European War, European and American countries tried their best to develop the above industries, but they only tended towards economic construction and commercial competition. After the countries joined the European War, the whole country was mobilized, and the above industries were directly transferred to the military equipment manufacturing industry. The needs of wartime should be prepared on a peacetime basis. According to recent statistics, the United States has 714 iron-smelting furnaces, Germany has 211 iron-smelting furnaces, and the United Kingdom has 187 iron-smelting furnaces. Japan has very little iron ore reserves, but there are 34 iron-smelting furnaces in the country, and the iron ore is purely taken from China. The reason why Japan must seize Manchuria is that once it obtains Manchuria, the source of iron ore and other raw materials for manufacturing steel can become increasingly stable. If we want to subdue Japan, we must first subdue it with economic policies. Before the Soviet Union implemented the Five-Year Plan, there were only about 70 iron-smelting furnaces in the country. After the success of the Five-Year Plan, it reached 103. It can be seen that the steel industry is important for the country's status and economic development. Each country's iron-smelting plant is also equipped with by-product coking furnaces, and many of the by-products are raw materials for manufacturing gunpowder. China currently has fewer than ten iron-smelting furnaces, large and small, and most of them are old or simple, and no by-product coking furnaces are attached to extract gunpowder raw materials. If we compare China's population with the number of steel consumed each year, the amount consumed per person is only one-two-hundredth of that of the United States. China currently consumes 600,000 tons of steel per year. If calculated according to the steel consumption rate of the United States, China would need 120 million tons of steel per year, which is one and a half times the world's steel production. According to recent statistics, the world's steel production is 94 million tons, of which the United States accounts for 45%, the United Kingdom accounts for 8%, Germany accounts for 15.5%, Japan only accounts for 1.5%, and other countries account for 30%. Therefore, based on the proportion of China's population to other countries, it should establish more iron-smelting furnaces and steel-making plants. Only when the steel industry is developed can all industries be developed accordingly, not to mention the relationship between national defense construction and the military industry. Currently, most of the raw materials required by China's arsenals are imported from foreign countries, and the degree of immaturity of its military industry is self-evident. Among the above-mentioned eighteen industries, the most difficult to establish and the most expensive are steel and oil. However, all military equipment is manufactured using steel as raw material. Therefore, steel occupies the most important position in the military industry and national defense construction. Establishing the foundation of the steel industry and attempting the independence of the steel industry should not be delayed for a day. Moreover, the steel industry is closely related to the transportation industry and other manufacturing industries. Here are the details of where steel is needed to manufacture all military equipment. Various guns, such as fortress guns, mountain guns, field guns, anti-aircraft guns, etc., have barrels made purely of Nickel-Chrome Steel or other Alloy Steel. The barrels of mortars are made of cast iron. Various guns, such as machine guns, heavy machine guns, rifles, box guns, submachine guns, pistols, etc., have barrels that are also made of Nickel-Chrome Steel or other Alloy Steel. Various gun carriages and gun accessories are made of ordinary steel (Carbon Steel) or Special Steel. Various bayonets are made of Tungsten Steel or Molybsenum Steel. The shells of fortress guns, mountain guns, and field guns are made of steel, brass, and lead, with steel being the most important part. Mortar shells are made of cast iron. Aircraft bombs are made of cast iron and brass, with cast iron accounting for the majority. In the manufacture of bullets, in addition to using copper, zinc, and lead, steel cups are also used. Tanks must be made of steel plates and other steel parts. Part of the aircraft must be made of Alloy Steel. The armor plate of warships is made of Chrome Steel, and other parts also require steel plates. Submarines must be made of steel plates. In summary, military equipment is almost entirely made of steel as an important raw material. Moreover, the by-products obtained from steel mills through coke production can be used to extract raw materials for gunpowder. In addition to developing ordinary industries, building a steel plant also means developing the military industry and the national defense industry. If you want all military equipment to be manufactured domestically, then building a steel plant will not be enough to produce all of the steel needed. China's military industry is still in its infancy. If we want to manufacture all military equipment, we may not be able to do so. The first step is to build a new-style steel plant to produce steel materials for military equipment in addition to supplying steel for industrial use, so as to build the foundation of national defense construction. If we want to combine this without establishing it, and only wait for the future to solve it, we will miss the opportunity and delay it. If things must be done, we should not be afraid of the difficulties and wait for the future. In short, for the sake of military equipment manufacturing, the construction of this steel plant cannot be delayed for a day. Or someone might say, since we want to build a steel plant, why not first reorganize and expand the existing Hanyang Iron Works? I don't know that the Hanyang Iron Works has become part of the collateral for the debts of the Hanyeping Company to the Japanese and cannot be freely disposed of by the government. Even if it can be freely disposed of, its furnace seats and machine parts have been used for many years and are already old-fashioned. It would also require a large investment to proceed, which is not economically sound. Moreover, the factory site has no room for expansion. As for the Longyan Iron Works in northern China, although a pig iron furnace has been built, it has not been fully completed. Even if a steel plant is added, the steel materials it produces can only be sold in the north. If it is transported south to the Yangtze River area or Fujian and Guangdong, the freight will be expensive and uneconomical. Therefore, the most urgent thing at present is to first build a new-style steel plant in the Yangtze River area. In the future, the steel materials produced can be used for the industry in the central part and can also be transported to the north and south without fear of stagnation. This is also the plan to concentrate the military industry. Or someone might say, the steel materials for manufacturing military equipment must be smelted by an Acid Siemens-Martin Furnace. If ordinary steel mills use the Baslc Martinprocesn to smelt steel, the steel materials are not suitable for guns and cannons. I don't know that the production of low-phosphorus pig iron or low-phosphorus iron ore in European and American countries is gradually decreasing. The smelting of military steel materials mostly uses ordinary pig iron to first smelt Semi-Steel in a basic Martin furnace, removing impurities such as sand phosphorus, and then pouring it into an acidic Martin furnace to smelt pure steel. Its quality is very clean and the same as acidic Martin steel. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry's steel plant plan is to add an acidic Martin furnace and a three-ton electric steel smelting furnace in the steel smelting plant, which can simultaneously produce special steel or alloy steel for manufacturing gun barrels. As for its production, it will depend on the amount of steel needed to manufacture weapons each year. The majority of the steel materials produced in the plant will still be ordinary steel to meet the needs of various industries, so as to still operate on the principle of business, and the principal and interest of the investment are effectively guaranteed, and a surplus can still be obtained, which is truly a win-win situation. As for the existing Hanyang Arsenal, although there is a small acidic Martin furnace, it has never been used and has become old and useless. Even if it is used one day, it will be necessary to purchase low-phosphorus pig iron from abroad, which is very uneconomical. As for the small steel smelting plant in the Shanghai Arsenal, it will also be dismantled due to the relocation of the arsenal. It would be more convenient to use the aforementioned heavy furnace steel smelting method in the currently planned steel plant to produce steel materials for the arsenal. The Ministry of Industry plans to establish a new-style steel plant in the central, northern, and southern parts of China, but it is not easy to raise such a huge amount of money at one time. Therefore, we will first start with the central steel plant, selecting a location near the capital to build the plant, which is the so-called central steel plant. The annual steel material production of the plant is set at 150,000 tons, which will be carried out in two parts and completed in four years. After the completion of each step of construction, more than 70,000 tons of steel material can be produced. In addition, the coal and ore production will be set at 3,000 tons per day. The source of raw materials, the steps to be taken, the quantity of products, and the capital, cost, and surplus of each item are described below. (Source of raw materials) The iron ore will be supplied by Dangtu and Fanchang in Anhui, and Phoenix Mountain in Nanjing. If it is not enough, it will be taken from Daye and Echeng in Hubei. The coking bituminous coal will be supplied by Suxian and Leijiagou coal mines in Anhui and Huaiyuan and Huainan coal mines. If it is not enough, it will be taken from Yixian in Shandong and Pingxiang in Jiangxi.</p>
<p>(Steps to be taken) It is divided into four years and carried out in two steps. The table is listed below.</p>

<p>What is meant by "guiding the Huai"? It means guiding it into the sea. The Huai already enters the sea. Why guide it? Is it entering the sea after causing harm, or entering the sea after creating benefits? These are vastly different. "Guiding" means removing its harm and creating its benefits. Considering the benefits and harms of the past, its guidance should be expedited and must be promoted, hence the term "advancement." Considering the benefits and harms of the future, its guidance should be even better, and must be discussed, hence the term "association." The urgency and excellence of guiding the Huai should be planned by the authorities, but the benefits and harms of guiding the Huai are truly experienced by our people. To experience benefits and harms without being moved is not human nature. This is why this association is established. What is the scope of the association? It should be determined by the scope of the benefits and harms. The reach of benefits and harms can be direct or indirect. The need to remove harm and create benefits is equal in both cases. Speaking of direct benefits and harms, the Jiang (Yangtze), Huai, He (Yellow River), and Ji were anciently called the "four independent rivers." "Independent" means flowing independently into the sea, so there was little harm. Since the Yellow River diverted the Huai's flow, the Huai River's path to the sea has been blocked. Blocked, it then enters the Yangtze. The Yangtze's strength is greater than the Huai's. The Huai cannot overcome the Yangtze and freely enter the sea, so the Huai's water becomes full and causes harm. In Anhui, it affects Lu, Feng, Ying, and Si; in Jiangsu, it affects Huai and Yang. In 1931, the Huai River overflowed in Anhui, and the Grand Canal breached in Jiangsu. The entire Huai River basin was spared, which is the most prominent example of its harm. Therefore, if the Huai River independently flows into the Yangtze River and the sea, the harm will be moderate, but if it enters the sea, the harm will be great, which is what is meant by "entering the sea after causing harm." This is the direct harm. The Huai is a clear-flowing river, suitable for irrigation and transportation, like the Yangtze. Its flow is sufficient to supply the farmland and waterways of the entire 2,000-mile Huai River basin, inexhaustibly. Today, only a dozen or so counties in Huai and Yang benefit, accounting for only one or two tenths of the Huai's water. The remaining eight or nine tenths are abandoned into the Yangtze, treated as waste. If it could all be utilized, the benefits would be unimaginable. This is the direct benefit. Furthermore, speaking of indirect benefits and harms, the reason the Yangtze can accommodate many flows is not in the Yangtze itself, but in the lakes along the Yangtze. Today, the gullies above Chongqing are already filled with rocks and sediment, becoming flat land over time. Of the lakes below Wuhan, seven or eight tenths have transitioned from fishing and animal husbandry to farming. Based on the difference between the high and low water levels of the Yangtze in the past twenty years, its water storage capacity is far less than before. Therefore, in 1921 and 1931, Hankou and Nanjing were flooded, reaching depths of over ten feet and receding for a month. Gaochun and Dongba almost collapsed. When the Yangtze is at its peak, it is also the time of the Huai's floods, which has been proven repeatedly. Above Zhenjiang, the Yangtze is confined by mountains and cannot expand. Even the Yangtze's channel below Jin and Jiao is limited. The ports of Chongming and Wusong are accumulating sediment and are not draining well. The Yangtze's discharge capacity is already struggling to cope. If a way is found to raise the Huai's water level and compete with the Yangtze, the Yangtze's flow will be impeded, inevitably overflowing between Nanjing and Wuhu. Then Gaochun's Dongba Dam and Gaoyou's Grand Canal embankment face the same danger: either breach the Grand Canal embankment to release the Huai, or breach the Dongba Dam to release the Yangtze. If the Yangtze breaches eastward, the Tai Lake basin will be even worse than the 1931 Huaiyang disaster. This is the inevitable trend of water, and the terrain is inescapable. Even if it is spared, the banks of the Yangtze will not be spared. This is the indirect harm to Jiangnan, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Changzhou, Songjiang, and Taicang. As for the Yi and Si rivers, they are inherently no match for the Huai. If the Huai has nowhere to go, the tailwaters of the Yi and Si will also be blocked, inevitably collapsing in the central Grand Canal basin, causing harm to Xuzhou and Haizhou. In 1931, the inner Grand Canal and the central Grand Canal simultaneously breached, and the disaster in Xuzhou and Haizhou was equal to that in Huaiyang. The reason lies in this. This is also the clear indirect harm of the Huai to Xuzhou and Haizhou. However, the indirect harm to Xuzhou and Haizhou is already a common sight, while the indirect harm to Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Changzhou, Songjiang, and Taicang is only a future potential threat, so fewer people pay attention. However, the old course of the Yangtze below Wuhu is the direct upstream of Tai Lake, and its embankment is at Gaochun's Dongba Dam. In 1931, the Yangtze River already gave a serious warning. This indirect scope of harm extends to the entire province of Jiangsu. In the past, when the Yellow River flowed south, the Huai was weak and the Yellow River was strong, unable to cross the Yellow River and find its way to the sea. It had to seek accommodation between the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, hence the system of ten dams returning to the Yangtze and five dams emptying into the sea, causing the human benefits of a large amount of clear water to become harmful water. Today, the Yellow River has moved north, and the Huai has ample space to enter the sea. Moreover, the Longhai Railway is the only trunk line spanning Asia, with the potential to connect to the European continent in the west and the Pacific shipping lanes in the east. Northern Jiangsu, at this junction of land and sea, must have a large commercial port to utilize this connection. However, freshwater is still lacking. This vast plain of 2,000 miles stretching south to Anhui, north to Jiangbei, and its tens of millions of people, also urgently need to use the production of the Huai River to connect with that commercial port day and night, thereby establishing a relationship with the world economy. The Huai, in addition to providing water to benefit the farmland of Huaiyang, should still be supplied as before. The remaining surplus water, which serves no purpose, seems to be able to be transformed from waste to good, to compensate for the value of our engineering consumption. If this plan of benefiting the people through benefits can be researched and achieved, the scope of indirect benefits will certainly not be limited to provincial boundaries. This is what is meant by "entering the sea after creating benefits." However, as this is the beginning of organizing a research group, it is not necessary to excessively expand the scope without boundaries. The people of Anhui have already established this association first, and their views on the benefits and harms of the Huai, and the means they hold to remove harm and create benefits, are not much different from those of our province. Therefore, we specifically cite this precedent and tentatively organize this association within the scope of the province to collect old news and seek new meanings, consult and exchange with all relevant parties, to help the Huai River guiding authorities gather ideas and increase benefits. We also hope that before the Huai River guiding authorities make a decision, they will be sincere and public with our people regarding the known benefits and harms of the past and the foreseeable benefits and harms of the future, so that our people can gradually understand, entrust their hearts and trust, and unite to achieve what is called "many hands make light work, many minds build a strong wall." This is the meaning of this association's "advancement." We respectfully present this idea to our fellow villagers, and attach the articles of association (omitted) to solicit like-minded people.

<h3 id="e148">Telegram Against Diverting the Yellow River into the Huai River <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices, the National Government Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the Huai River Guiding Committee, the Yangtze River Committee, the governments of Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Henan: According to the Anhui Tianjin Fellow Association, the Henan Construction Department recently planned to divert the Yellow River from below Rongze into the Jialu River (southern Henan), through the Dasha River (northern Anhui), and then into the Huai River and the Yangtze River. Also, reading the Nine Days Newspaper, the Huai River Guiding Committee made some explanations to the people of Anhui who opposed diverting the Yellow River into the Huai River, saying that this move would not harm Anhui. It seems that the matter is inevitable. But if so, it would harm the Huai, harm the Yangtze, harm the Grand Canal, and harm the source of the national and people's economy. The Yellow River has been a harmful water in the Central Plains of our country for thousands of years. The source of the Yellow River is more than 13,800 feet above sea level. Above Mengjin, the mountain ranges on both sides are close together, and the water quality is still clear, so it is not very harmful. Below Rongze, the loose soil of the plains is eroded by the rapid currents, carrying sediment downstream, which inevitably causes siltation over time, with the most changes, and there will be problems every hundred years. This is the general situation. The method of Yu the Great in controlling the waters was to divide them. First, he divided the Yangtze, Huai, Yellow River, and Ji into four independent rivers, each flowing independently into the sea, which was to prevent them from combining and harming each other. And the method of governing the Yellow River was to divide it into nine in its lower reaches, turning the trunk into branches. This is the opposite of the method of governing the Yangtze and Huai rivers, which is to gather the branches into the trunk to enter the sea. Still, he did not think it was enough and devoted himself to the streams, ditches, and canals to divide them finely, so that the fields everywhere had a place to hold water, and the people could enjoy the benefits of water without suffering its harm. Therefore, Gun was an ancient engineer, and Yu was an ancient water conservancy expert. Because he controlled the water as a water conservancy expert, his purpose and means were able to transcend the scope of water and not be confined to the limits of water. Therefore, he could utilize water without being used by water. In later generations, Yellow River and sea engineering belonged to the central government, and farmland water conservancy was the responsibility of the local government. Since the functions were divided, the purposes were different. The central governments of past dynasties governed the Yellow River as engineers, and their focus was only on the prevention of the Yellow River itself, and not on other methods of accommodating it. Over time, they only knew that streams, ditches, and canals were the path for draining rainwater into the giant river, and forgot that they had the function of dividing the land and distributing water to the fields. In the vast Central Plains, except for the rice-producing areas, the legacy of ditches and canals has disappeared. As a result, the Yellow River's disaster has never ceased. This is clear evidence that governing the Yellow River should be divided and not combined. The Yangtze and Huai river basins have sticky soil and clear water, and the lakes can exist permanently as natural water storage devices. Diverting water into the lakes is enough to reduce the anger of the water, and the land is suitable for rice cultivation, so irrigation requires many ditches and canals, and the capacity is naturally large. The Yellow River, on the other hand, has loose sand and muddy water, and lakes near the Yellow River cannot exist. Creating lakes on wasteland is impossible, and digging lakes is impossible. Only the system of streams, ditches, and canals can replace them, and allow farmland utilization to exist permanently. The difference between Gun and Yu lies in this. Otherwise, the Yellow River basin is not a widespread rice-growing area, and the rainfall in the northwest is not as great as in the southeast. Why did the well-field system and the ditch and canal system decline only after three dynasties and two thousand years? There must be something immortal about it. The Construction Department has the functions of both Yellow River and sea engineering and farmland water conservancy. It should plan comprehensively to make the Yellow River's water divided and beneficial, and should not make it combined and harmful. This is speaking of the benefits and harms of the Yellow River itself. Since the Song and Yuan dynasties, diverting the Yellow River into Bian caused Bian to be blocked, diverting the Yellow River into the Si caused the lakes of the Si to dry up, and diverting the Yellow River into the Huai caused the lower reaches of the Huai to be silted up. Today, the Huai has nowhere to go, causing harm to Ying, Feng, Hao, Si, Huai, and Yang. The reason for waiting for guidance and treatment is the disease of the Yellow River and Huai rivers joining. Moreover, the areas with long coastlines in the world are the places where culture and economy originated. Only our Huaihai region connects three provinces, occupying more than 600 miles of coastline, but its culture and economy are no different from the hinterland. This is also due to the Yellow River sand flowing down and the sea tides rising up, resulting in high beaches and shallow water, losing its coastline efficiency. Therefore, the coast of northern Jiangsu cannot only not compete with the coastlines of the world, but it is also far inferior to the seas of Shanghai, Tianjin, Shandong, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. Fortunately, the tailwaters of the Yangtze River are still a major global port for navigation. If the Yellow River is diverted into the Huai River to the right, it will inevitably enter the sea through the Yangtze River, then the north and south of the Wusongkou will be full of sandy islands, all becoming flat land, and the Shanghai Sea will not be navigable. If the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are blocked due to siltation, then the area between Wuhu and Jinling will inevitably be full, collapsing the Dongba Dam, entering Tai Lake, and seeking another downstream Qian Tang River to flow into the sea. Since the Yellow River occupies the Huai River channel, the vast plain of northern Anhui and southern Huai will have no banks, and the floods will overflow freely, with nowhere to go. The largest plain in our country, except for the desert, that is sufficient to be a farming area is Liaoning, Jilin, and Rehe in the north, and Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang in the south. Now, the one in the north has been invaded by strong neighbors, leaving only this small remaining fruit, and destroying it ourselves. Where will the foundation of national wealth and the people's economy be entrusted? This is also about the benefits and harms of the Yangtze, Huai, coast, and the nation and the people. I believe that those who govern the water should consider the entire benefits and harms of the water before deciding on their policy. They must judge it with the knowledge of a water conservancy expert, and not just with the knowledge of an engineer. Governing water is a political matter, not just a technical matter. To see the small and not see the big will inevitably harm the matter. Our association is a water conservancy research organization. Because the benefits and harms are closely related, we dare not sacrifice the lives and property of tens of millions of people on the plains of the lower reaches of the Huai River for the Henan Construction Department to conduct Yellow River control experiments. Therefore, we dare to offer our views and humbly request a speedy halt to the Henan province's plan, and we are eagerly awaiting orders. The Jiangsu Huai River Guiding Advancement Association kowtows, respectfully.</p>

<p>The overseas Chinese in Surong Port, Papua, Dutch East Indies, are concerned about their motherland, indignant at the ambition of the Japanese invaders, and grieved by the loss of the eastern provinces. Recently, news of the Japanese invasion of Rehe and the forced occupation of Yuguan spread, and overseas Chinese were all outraged. Fortunately, the Northeastern Volunteer Army rose up to kill the enemy and their determination to save the country is firm. However, due to a lack of food and equipment, they have been unable to defeat the Japanese bandits and recover lost territory. They urgently need donations from overseas Chinese everywhere for assistance. Therefore, the Chinese Qunyi Society in Surong Port launched a campaign to solicit daily donations from overseas Chinese, adhering to the declaration of Mr. Ma Xiangbo, 94 years old, to calculate by population, regardless of men, women, old, or young, each person should donate one cent per day, so as to accumulate small amounts into a large sum. The money is being sent in batches to the Shanghai Shenbao for forwarding and remittance to meet the needs of the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. This shows that the overseas Chinese in Surong Port deeply understand the righteousness and are enthusiastic about saving the country, which is highly commendable.</p>

Present were General Zhu, representatives Xiao and Sun, Cheng Zhiping, Li Shizeng, Yan Zhifang, and others. The association was represented by Ms. Song Zhen, Chen Xingrong, Kuang Huiyi, He Xiangning, and representative Zhang Qiong. Ms. Song Zhen first reported on the meaning of the welcome, followed by General Zhu's response, in which he reported on the various conditions of the soldiers on the battlefield and the difficulties in transportation, and hoped that the rear would assist with supplies such as automobiles, clothing, and medicines. Then, representative Xiao reported on the bloody battle of Xifengkou, and said that the army would not be intimidated by the enemy's sharp weapons, airplanes, and artillery. They deeply knew that Japan's victories in the Russo-Japanese War were all due to the soldiers' willingness to sacrifice and not value their lives, which was extremely insightful. Finally, Cheng Zhiping, representative of Shang Zhen, reported on the battle in Lengkou. The reason they were able to resist the enemy and recapture the key point of Gukou was that they were able to use their strengths to attack the enemy's weaknesses, and using close combat and night battles was a good strategy for victory.</p>

<p>Appeal Sent Back for Retrial by the Third Branch of the High Court</p>
<p>Ling Hua, also known as Hua Sannan, a young woman from Dangkou, Suzhou, who formerly resided at No. 4 Deyi Lane, Tangjiawan, Ximen, is now 25 years old. On the evening of July 13, 1927 (when she was 19 years old), she took a neighboring child to the French Park in Gujiazhai to watch the French National Day memorial lantern festival. In the park, she met Ling Yian, a local man of about the same age as her, who currently resides at No. 33 Boxiang Village, Rue Luthy, and works as a clerk in the paint department of the De Fu Foreign Firm on the Jiangxi Road, Zhejiang Industrial Bank building. After talking, they learned that she was a young unmarried woman and he was also unmarried. They fell in love at first sight and wanted to become husband and wife. They soon had physical relations. Hua urged Ling to hire a matchmaker and after reaching an agreement, they began to live together without a wedding ceremony. After living together, their love grew deeper, and they had a son and a daughter, both of whom died young due to illness. Until April of last year, Ling became acquainted with a woman named Wang, and the couple's relationship gradually cooled down, and quarrels often arose. Ling then sent Hua back to her parents' home and abandoned her. She hired a matchmaker to negotiate with Ling, but to no avail. Therefore, she hired lawyer Zhao Zuwei to file a complaint with the criminal court of the Second Special Court, accusing Ling of obstructing public morals and abandonment, requesting an investigation, and attaching a civil lawsuit to recover losses of 5,000 yuan. The court, according to the complaint, opened a hearing on the eighth of last month to summon the defendant, Ling Yian, who also hired lawyer Zhu Dianqing to defend him. Because both sides admitted their relationship as husband and wife, but had not been married, the court ruled that the relationship of husband and wife was not in accordance with the criminal procedure of self-prosecution, and the court ruled that the case would not be accepted. The situation has been reported in previous newspapers. Now, Hua is dissatisfied with the original judgment and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. The trial was reopened by Judge Zhou, along with judges Guo and Fan, and Prosecutor Zhang. After summoning the two sides for argument, the court announced the end of the debate the day before yesterday and ruled to overturn the original judgment. The case should be tried by the Shanghai Second Special District Court. The case has been sent back to the original trial court by the High Court, and the trial will be reopened soon to summon both parties for retrial. At that time, the lawyers on both sides will surely have a fierce debate.</p>

After recovering from the injury last year, he came to Shanghai from Tongzhou and returned to his home in Zhoupu. He chose March 4 of this year to get married. Wu learned that Wang's arm had been broken, so she did not want to marry him. After the matchmaker persuaded her, the woman's father agreed. However, when the woman learned that her father had agreed, she was very angry and often quarreled with her father. The day before the wedding, she sent a letter to the matchmaker, vowing that she would never marry. She then returned the six gifts she had received and compensated for the loss of ten yuan. Wang was extremely resentful that his engagement with the woman had been dissolved. The day before yesterday, he went to the Chenjiahang riverside of the southern Huangpu River and jumped into the river. Fortunately, the captain of a steamship moored at the Pudong Rope Factory hooked him with a pole and rescued him. After questioning him, he was sent home. Wang's head was injured by the pole. Yesterday, his uncle sent him to a hospital in Shanghai for treatment.</p>

<p>Only the Storefront Window and Some Cloth Were Destroyed</p>
<p>The Assailant Reportedly Wore Student Attire</p>
<p>Renfeng Cotton Cloth and General Merchandise Store, located at Nos. 339-341 Avenue Edward VII, at the intersection of Rue du Moulin, is one of the major general merchandise and cloth stores on Rue du Consulat in the French Concession. It is currently in its grand opening and offering large discounts, and business is even more prosperous. At 7:30 PM last night, someone suddenly threw a hand-pulled grenade into the store from the center of the eastern road. The sound of the explosion shook the neighborhood. Fortunately, all the store employees were having dinner in the back at the time, leaving only one or two people to guard the store, so no one was injured. By the time everyone rushed out, the grenade thrower had already disappeared without a trace. At the same time, the nearby Grand Stand Clock Police Station heard the news and dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. The investigation revealed that one side of the display window had been destroyed, six bolts of Hengzi brand high-quality fine twill fabric from the Wuxi Meiheng Factory had been damaged, eight bolts of bleached cloth from the brands of Fair, Yuanfang, Yihuo, and Taihe had been damaged, and five bolts of domestic silk crepe had been damaged. Several pieces of shattered grenade shells were collected and taken to the police station for investigation. Afterwards, according to witnesses in the vicinity, the grenade thrower was a young man in student attire. After throwing the grenade, he fled south towards MinGuo Road.</p>

<p>Wounded Soldier Sent to Lester Chinese Hospital for Treatment</p>
<p>Perpetrator Fled the Scene but Was Subsequently Arrested</p>
<p>At approximately 9 PM last night, two U.S. Marine Corps soldiers arrived at the Far Eastern Hotel at the intersection of Xizang Road and Guangdong Road seeking lodging. The hotel's cashier assigned them Room 111. The soldiers paid the room fee on the spot. Around 10 PM, four more soldiers from the same unit arrived, carrying a case of beer. The six soldiers then opened the case and began drinking and making merry in the room. In less than three hours, all the soldiers were heavily intoxicated, with beer bottles scattered all over the table. Unexpectedly, two of the soldiers suddenly disagreed and began arguing, which quickly escalated into a physical fight. One soldier, unable to withstand the other's force, drew his bayonet and repeatedly stabbed the other soldier, inflicting over ten wounds to his upper and lower body. The four soldiers present immediately rushed forward to try to disarm the assailant, but he turned and fled the room. The soldier ran aimlessly in several directions before finally identifying the main entrance and escaping. The hotel cashier, having learned of the incident, promptly reported it to the police. A police ambulance and a large number of detectives were dispatched. They first transported the injured soldier to Lester Chinese Hospital for treatment, and then detained the remaining four soldiers, along with the beer bottles and case, taking them all to the police station. After questioning, they were handed over to their commanding officer for further action. It was later learned that the fleeing assailant had also been apprehended by his unit.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Two Bags of Morphine Hidden in Shoe Soles <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>| Over One Hundred Ounces of Morphine Seized in Total |</p>
<p>Director Wen of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, acting on a tip received the day before yesterday, learned that Wang Yaozhou, a native of Shaoxing, who operated the Lao Wang Zhengxing drum shop at No. 182 Fangbang Road in the city, was secretly running a large-scale morphine drug operation, specializing in the trafficking and sale of various narcotics. Consequently, at approximately 9 PM that evening, he dispatched Inspector Zheng Tingwei of the Inspection Department to the Second Precinct of the First District to request assistance in the investigation. Director Liu of the precinct then led Sergeant Li Fuyi and others to the Lao Wang Zhengxing drum shop, first surrounding the premises to prevent anyone from entering or leaving. They then entered the premises and conducted a search of the lower floor of the east building, but found no contraband. They immediately went upstairs to continue the search and soon discovered the illicit operation in a dark, small room on the rear floor. They found a tin basin containing white morphine, as well as four tin cans, each about a foot long and the diameter of a silver dollar, sealed at both ends with iron sheets. Upon opening them, they found that they also contained morphine. Shortly thereafter, they noticed a pair of leather shoes placed under a table. Upon closer inspection, they discovered that the shoes had false soles. They pried open the false soles and found two bags of morphine hidden inside. The total weight of all the morphine seized was estimated to be over one hundred ounces. They then searched the bedrooms of Wang's family members and found two rifles, both manufactured by the Hanyang Arsenal, a bayonet, one Mauser pistol bullet, one ammunition belt, and nine rifle bullets. However, the shop owner, Wang Yaozhou, had already fled upon hearing the news. His son, Wang Zijin, was detained, along with four others found in the room: Xu Jintian from Shandong, Zhang Gengqing from Henan, Liu Xikui from Danyang, and Chuan Rongsheng from Ningbo. All the evidence seized was brought to the police station. During preliminary questioning by Director Liu, the suspects gave evasive and contradictory statements, shifting blame among themselves. Considering the gravity of the matter, he ordered that a written report be prepared and that the suspects and witnesses be handed over to the Municipal Police Bureau for further investigation.</p>

<p>The National Goods Discount Market, established by the Shanghai National Goods Trading Company on Nanjing Road to counter the dumping of Japanese goods, opened yesterday.

It was reported that by 12 PM, total sales were only over 4,000 yuan, but the crowds of shoppers were already exceptionally dense. From 2 PM onwards, the number of shoppers surged like a tide, resulting in sales exceeding four times the earlier figure. The shop assistants were overwhelmed with work.

<h3 id="e164">A Well-Dressed Swindler <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Impersonating Court Personnel to Investigate Cases</p>
<p>Daring to Defraud Parties of Investigation Fees</p>
<p>| Swindler Displays Extravagance, Riding in a Chartered Car |</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place where people from all walks of life gather, and good and bad are mixed together. Deceitful and fraudulent activities occur frequently. Recently, a type of middle-class or upper-class rogue, dressed impeccably, has been impersonating investigators dispatched by the court to defraud parties of investigation fees. It so happened that the wife of Hu A'hong, Hu Yuan, who lived on Rue Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession, previously asked her old neighbor, Lu Jintao, to introduce business to her nephew. Lu, coveting Hu Yuan's beauty and money, attempted to seduce her unsuccessfully. Lu then falsely claimed that the business introduction had been successful and lured Hu Yuan to a lodging near Caojiadu shoe factory under the pretext of discussing the matter. There, Lu forcibly raped her. Subsequently, Lu often took advantage of Hu Yuan's husband's absence at work to arrange secret rendezvous and extort money from her for lavish spending. As time passed, Lu went a step further, demanding that Hu Yuan divorce her husband and live with him. When she refused, Lu learned of her husband's hospitalization and tricked Hu Yuan's brother into coming to Shanghai. Lu then confined and monitored the siblings, forcing them to sign a divorce agreement, threatening to kill them otherwise. Unable to endure the pressure, Hu Yuan pretended to agree and signed the document, regaining her freedom. She immediately hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, accusing Lu of obstructing her freedom and requesting an investigation and the revocation of the document. When the court summoned Lu based on the lawsuit, he had already fled upon hearing the news, and the hearing was rescheduled, as reported in previous newspapers. On the afternoon of the third of this month, Hu Yuan found Lu and brought him to the court. After the court held a hearing, Lu hired a lawyer who posted bail and secured his release pending further hearings. Unexpectedly, during this time, a well-dressed swindler, dressed in a Western suit and riding in a chartered car, claiming to be dispatched by the court to investigate the facts, visited Hu Yuan's home. Hu Yuan, unaware of the deception, truthfully recounted the events to the swindler. The swindler then told her that he could help her but required half of the investigation fee and transportation costs, totaling twelve yuan. Hu Yuan, not suspecting anything, gathered the money and gave it to him. The day before yesterday, when the hearing resumed, the defendant was represented by a lawyer. The plaintiff, Hu Yuan, also appeared in court with her lawyer and recounted the facts. She mentioned that someone claiming to be from the court had come to investigate and had taken the investigation fee. The judge, upon hearing this, was astonished and told Hu Yuan that the court had not sent anyone to investigate and that the visitor must have been a swindler. He advised her to be vigilant and, if she encountered him, to immediately bring him to the court for questioning. He also instructed that the case required investigation by the police station and that the defendant had failed to appear again, so the hearing would be postponed and a summons issued again. The judge instructed the defendant's lawyer to ensure the defendant's presence at the next hearing, or else he would be arrested. With that, the court adjourned. Only then did Hu Yuan realize that she had been deceived by a swindler. She immediately searched the audience seats in the courtroom but could not find the swindler anywhere. She then returned home dejectedly.</p>

<p>Method for Converting to Yuan, based on a conversion rate of 0.715. Upon receiving the reply, the Federation immediately notified the citizens within the district, issuing a notice stating: "Regarding the matter of notification, it has been found that various taxes and levies in this district have traditionally been calculated in silver taels, and tax collectors often do not convert them at the current market rate. The citizens of this district have felt greatly inconvenienced by this. Although the individual losses may seem small, they accumulate over time to a significant amount. Now that the National Government has officially ordered the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan, this order must be obeyed. A letter was sent to the French Concession Municipal Council, and the Council has now issued a joint reply from the Superintendent and General Manager, translated as follows: 'We have received your letter of March 16th, stating that taxes and levies within the concession have traditionally been calculated in silver taels, and tax collectors often do not convert them at the current market rate. Now that the National Government has officially ordered the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan, you request that we instruct the Tax Bureau to unanimously comply. We have carefully considered this matter. We acknowledge your Federation's deep concern for the interests of the citizens. We have decided to implement the method of abolishing taels and adopting yuan, based on a conversion rate of 0.715, effective April 1st, and have notified the Tax Bureau to comply accordingly.' In light of this, since the Municipal Council has decided on the method for converting silver to yuan, effective April 1st, citizens of this district may henceforth pay various taxes and levies based on the conversion rate of 0.715. This notice is hereby issued to all citizens of the district for their information." This notice is issued.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Letters to the Editor <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor, Upon reading yesterday's report in the "Local News" section of your newspaper, which stated that "a strike by fashion industry workers was triggered by Jin Taixiang shop owner Hu Jinhai's violation of the agreement, resulting in the payment of only ten cents per piece," I was greatly surprised. During the strike, some of the striking workers came to the shop and invited others to join the strike. At that time, I was not in the shop, and I do not know how, but a fight broke out between the workers, and they were arrested and sent to the police station. Afterward, the police summoned me for questioning and asked if I wanted to prosecute the workers for disturbing business. I did not want the workers to be implicated and replied that I requested that they be spared prosecution. However, the police did not grant my request and transferred the case to the court. These facts can be verified by those present at the scene. Regarding the issue of wages, the Social Bureau mediated and decided to increase the wages. Our shop followed this decision by adding ten cents per piece to the wages at the end of January. How can it be said that we violated the decision of the Party and government organs? Furthermore, our shop's workers have no complaints. I am afraid that the reports are inaccurate and hastily request that you make a correction. Respectfully, Hu Jinhai of Jin Taixiang, April 9th, 1933.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor, Upon reading your newspaper's news on the 8th, regarding "Japanese ruffians causing trouble at the Luban Daolida Silk Factory," this is entirely untrue. Zhang Zhipeng is not an employee of our distribution office, but rather a friend. On that day, he was visiting Longhua with a Japanese friend, and they passed by our factory and stopped in for a brief visit. They left shortly after, and there was no trouble caused. This matter has absolutely no connection to our factory. I am deeply afraid that the outside world will misunderstand the truth, which would affect our factory's reputation. I request that your newspaper immediately make a correction. Sincerely, Dongya Silk Weaving Factory, April 9th.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor, I was quite surprised to read the report in your newspaper's evening edition regarding "a strike by all the workers in the third department of the Yi Yuan Factory." The facts stated in the report are quite different from the truth. Our factory dismissed four casual workers who mend shoes - Cai Richu, Li Rongjiang, Dehua, and Yang Jia - for violating factory rules. These four individuals held grudges and coerced the workers to strike. Fortunately, the workers understood the importance of the situation and continued to work as usual. There was no strike or detention of workers. Seeing that their scheme had failed, the four individuals fabricated a report of a strike, attempting to confuse public opinion. The outside world is unaware of the truth, and I am deeply afraid that members of society will misunderstand the situation. Therefore, I specially write to your newspaper to request a correction. Respectfully, Shanghai Yi Yuan Elm Bark Manufacturing Factory, April 9th.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Regarding the Discussion Letters on the Question of "Can One Return to the Countryside?" <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>(Two) Letter from Zhang Meijun of this City</p>
<p>Because of the economic bankruptcy of the countryside, a large number of laborers and intellectuals unable to make a living flow into the cities. Moreover, due to the commercial contraction in the cities, those who cannot find work, as well as those who have lost their jobs, are thinking of returning to the countryside in large numbers. Thus, the question of "Can One Return to the Countryside?" is raised. This is an overall social problem, not one that can be solved by isolated individuals. If one does not consider it from the perspective of the entire society but only from a personal viewpoint, one will inevitably encounter a dead end. Therefore, after reading Mr. You Huaigao, who has "always been enthusiastically advocating rural education to save the country," in response to Mr. Xiongsheng's letter, I have the following questions: (1) Mr. Huaigao said that the prerequisites for going to the countryside are: 1. Do you love the countryside? 2. Do you sincerely love your rural farmer friends? 3. Are you determined to work hard to make a living in the countryside? If these are the prerequisites, then we must recognize that the people who now want to return to the countryside originally came out of the countryside because they "do not love the countryside," "do not love the rural farmer friends," and "cannot endure hard work to make a living in the countryside." They are entirely motivated by a desire for ease and laziness, rather than being driven out by economic oppression in the countryside. At the same time, it can also be said that Mr. Xiongsheng wants to return to the countryside because he does not love the city, etc. This is completely detached from reality and will not find a way to solve the problem. (2) "The only way out for the intellectual class is to undertake the education of the countryside and the revitalization of the countryside." This is correct, but how to educate and revitalize? I want to educate, but first I must study the reasons why it cannot be educated. Naturally, this cannot be attributed to a lack of educational talents, or to the fact that people who are capable of education do not love the countryside... Similarly, to revitalize the countryside, we must first study the reasons for its destruction. Only gilded doctors would say that the destruction of the countryside is not due to imperialist aggression but due to "stupidity," due to not knowing "organization" such as cooperatives. If the causes of destruction are not removed, it is like water flooding the fields, not repairing the dikes, but only drawing water. Naturally, it is labor without effect. There was a gentleman in Changsha who worked hard in rural education, using his energy and the salary he earned from teaching on this school. As a result, the educational achievements were […], revitalization was out of the question, and the bankruptcy of the rural area there deepened with the trend, and it did not ease up because there was such a hardworking person there. This old gentleman only woke up in his sixties and has now abandoned his school. […], his school is exactly the same as or even better than what Mr. Huaigao envisions. […], he resolutely participated in the so-called overall reform movement. Therefore, I dare say that this kind of New Village movement is not the way out. It does not transform the entire life of the countryside, so naturally individual life and, as Mr. Huaigai said, "you are the leader of a village, you can carry out village governance work," cannot be realized. (3) Mr. Huaigao only pays attention to the issue of the intellectual class returning to the countryside, that is, the personal way out for intellectuals, and does not see the tens of thousands of labor reserves squeezed out of the countryside (naturally, there are also many intellectuals in this). (4) Speaking of individual intellectuals, "to find a rural area with abundant production and a secure livelihood... to live in this rural area..." Honestly, if there was a "relatively abundant production and a secure livelihood," they would not have rolled out of the "stable" countryside to this vast, unreliable city. Even if they came, and encountered setbacks, they would immediately go back, without having to consult the gentlemen of the "Readers' Advisory Column." You should know that now most rural children want to find wild vegetables, chop firewood, feed cattle..., helping their parents to do work to fill their stomachs. Schools do not cost money, but they are still unwilling to come. This is what I have seen with my own eyes. If "tens of thousands of returned students from various countries and graduates from universities and middle schools" still have some "relatively abundant and secure livelihoods..." that can accommodate them, they would have gone long ago and would not have to bother the "rural education theorists" to instruct them before they are willing to abandon the concept of "not loving the countryside" and stop staying in the unemployed and starving metropolis. To transform society, the entire society, aspiring young people should take the road of struggle. The individualistic, New Village-style reform movement is already outdated! (There are four more letters, to be published tomorrow)</p>

<h3 id="e172">### Killing the Wrong Person <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>The other day, a newspaper carried a statement by a gentleman recounting the conversations of returnees from Changchun, saying: The Japanese have already completed the two major policies of "monopolizing opium" and "unifying the currency system" in the puppet state. These two things, which everyone thought were impossible to sort out in the old Zhang and young Zhang era, are now being handled in an orderly manner with a single wave of their hands. Therefore, the gentleman sighed: "I once discussed the harm of currency disorder with people from the Northeast, and all attributed it to the difficulty of reversing the accumulated problems, using it as an excuse for being difficult to handle. Why can the Japanese accomplish this in an instant? 'It is that they do not do it, not that they cannot do it.' This is a major root of the nation's illness!"</p>
<p>How can it be only a "root of illness"! The demise of the Chinese race and the overthrow of the Republic of China also lie in this phthisis. When a society, a nation, reaches old age, everything is "difficult to reverse the accumulated problems," so "revolution" is necessary. Revolution is a process of social upheaval; in the process, some good people, some bad people, and some people who are neither good nor bad will always be killed. Killing some people is not without a price; it has an isolating effect on society, dividing the old society and the new society into two distinct segments, so that the evil forces will not infect the new organization. Therefore, revolutionary killings should have standards and should kill more people over middle age, more people who represent the old forces. The success of the French Revolution lay in the sweeping away of the old forces during the Reign of Terror.</p>
<p>However, every revolution in China always goes against the norm. Many young people have sacrificed themselves by participating in revolutionary movements; in the process of revolution, the old forces temporarily hide away, but they are not eliminated at all; after the success of the revolution, the old forces re-emerge and make young people their sacrificial victims again, killing a large number of them. Mr. Sun Yat-sen worked hard for more than ten years on revolutionary work. The Xinhai Revolution succeeded, but Yuan Shikai took power and killed party members every day, even children of fifteen or sixteen years old; such a revolution not only does not have an isolating effect, but simply acts as a bodyguard for the old forces; therefore, since the Republic of China, there has only been senility, no vigor, and there is no need to talk about reform in any undertaking. As soon as reform is mentioned, it is bound to be "difficult to reverse the accumulated problems, using it as an excuse for being difficult to handle." […], its evil forces have been injected all the way to the present.</p>
<p>I call this abnormal state "killing the wrong person." I often say to my friends: "There is no such thing as a bloodless revolution. But 'blood' must not be shed on the wrong person. Killing Puyi earlier, killing more Zheng Xiaoxu and the like, is the great fortune of the country. If young people under the age of twenty-five are killed indiscriminately, reversing the natural order and undermining the vitality of society, then one can obtain the 'immediate retribution' of 'national subjugation and racial extinction.'"</p>
<h3 id="e173">Evening <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Ailun</p>
<p>It was already time to light the lamps, and Fuxian knew that she was already feeling weary, and that inevitable life was about to begin again. She sat lazily in front of the dressing table and began to tidy up. The mirror reflected her haggard shadow like a withered flower, and she felt even more like an aging beauty. The life of selling smiles that she had been playing with for the past few years, when she recalled it, she could not tell whether it was bitter or sour.</p>
<p>Her younger sister, Lixian, had already dressed up enchantingly, and like a little bird, flew east and flew west, chattering to her sister about some trivial matters about the neighbors next door and across the street. Although Fuxian had always loved her sister and never found anything bad about her, she felt a little annoyed with her sister today.</p>
<p>The notes sent from restaurants and taverns flew in one after another. Fuxian finally could not resist the urging of the rickshaw puller, put her sister on her lap, and let the rickshaw puller run quickly.</p>
<p>In this way, from one restaurant to one tavern, and then from that tavern to another restaurant, according to the urging of the notes, she dealt with them one by one, and then the sisters sat in a chartered car and ran back as before.</p>
<p>On the way home, Fuxian encountered many sisters who were living the same life of selling smiles, sitting in cars equipped with bright electric lights. She felt that they all had an incredible pride in their youth. The stimulation they gave her was really too great, so the scenes in the restaurants and taverns just now were reflected on her meninges one after another.</p>
<p>Those distinguished guests now mostly ignore her, and show unusual courtesy only to her sister Lixian, so Lixian is often surrounded by the guests, while she sits coldly in a corner. She noticed that her sister had learned to use a wonderful and charming gaze to bewitch those men who were chasing her. Needless to say, Lixian had received considerable training. But why can't she do the same? Why doesn't she understand the secrets of "autumn waves flirting and charming smiles"? But what if she did? Would those distinguished guests still have a good impression of Fuxian, who is in her thirties? This is something she herself does not believe.</p>
<p>She looked at her sister sitting on her lap and felt that her sister was like a delicate flower just beginning to bloom, while she was like fallen petals in March, the end of spring. However, when she thought of her sister being the same age as herself, she felt a blur in her eyes.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the door of their house, her sister saw a bag of tears in her sister's eyes as she got out of the car.</p>
<p>"Sister! What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?"</p>
<p>"Sister! It's nothing." She took her sister's tender hand and kissed it.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Younger Brother <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Peng</p>
<p>Silently placing the wreath on the grave, all I could hear was the wild grass around me rustling in the wind. Thinking that my poor younger brother was lying alone beneath this pile of yellow earth, I couldn't help but feel an endless stream of sad memories涌 rise in my heart:</p>
<p>Three years after I was born, my younger brother was born into our family. Because he was born stupid since he was a child, he always suffered losses in everything. At school, he was often beaten by teachers and bullied by older children. When he returned home, his father never treated him with a kind word. Living in a family whose sustenance was already very poor, my younger brother was even worse, often struggling in an environment of hunger and cold.</p>
<p>At the age of thirteen, after graduating from elementary school, his father sent him to work as an apprentice in a grocery store in a small town more than ten miles away from home. The store had only one boss, and my younger brother worshiped that person as his teacher. Later, every time I went to that store to see him, I always saw the boss sitting leisurely in the store peeling his nails, while my younger brother, with his head and face covered in coal dust, kept drilling out of the kitchen and then drilling back in. After finally catching a break and talking to him, he quietly told me with tears in his eyes:</p>
<p>"The teacher wants me to do things in the store and also wants me to cook. If I don't cook well, or accidentally break a bowl, he will beat me and scold me... I don't want to live here, brother, take me back!"</p>
<p>"If you go back, Dad will beat you to death. Be patient and stay here for a while!"</p>
<p>Although my heart was filled with unbearable pain at letting him suffer there, I did not have the courage to take him back when I thought of my father's violent temper and the increasingly difficult family situation. But not long after, my younger brother finally ran back alone. When my father widened his eyes and furiously whipped him, I couldn't help but kneel down in front of my father with tears in my eyes and beg him for mercy.</p>
<p>Later, it happened that a friend of my father's opened a rice store in 乂乂 County, and my younger brother was transferred to that rice store to work as an apprentice.</p>
<p>Because it was relatively far away from there, I rarely had the opportunity to visit him afterwards. But from the letters he sent back each time, I knew that he was still struggling in a difficult environment. He said that because he had to help them carry the heavy bags of rice every day, he often felt pain in his bones all over his body at night. He also said that he had recently wanted to steal some time to read books and asked me to find some easy-to-understand books and send them to him. He said that every time he saw those fellows carrying their schoolbags to school, he felt jealous and hated, and was indescribably sad.</p>
<p>Two years later, a friend of mine was willing to introduce him to work as a student in a bookstore in 乂乂 County, Fujian Province.</p>
<p>When I told him this news, we were worried that he would not be willing to go. […], so young, to leave home alone for more than a thousand miles! But the fact was contrary to our expectations, and he actually agreed happily. He said that he would no longer have to do hard labor there, and he could also see many new books. He said that the bookstore was the paradise he had always dreamed of...</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, only a short year after going there, my younger brother died of illness in a foreign land with no relatives. When I suddenly received that telegram, my heart was truly like it had sunk into a bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>Now it has been a year since my younger brother's remains were moved back to his hometown and buried. Every time I pass by my younger brother's grave, I feel endless loss and sadness. When I think of all the suffering my younger brother endured in his short life of more than ten years, I can't help but shed tears. Really, it seems that my younger brother was born only to experience the hardships of the world and had no other purpose! What a cruel fate!</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin looks down on people too much. I also graduated from a girls' middle school. Although my English grades are a bit poor, my Chinese essays are always graded A in every exam. I can even read Guo Moruo's translation of The Sorrows of Young Werther. What's more, it's just a love letter written to you by a girl from a girls' middle school! Mr. Lin, don't look down on people too much! ·········"</p>
<p>Haiquan listened to her say a lot, initially thinking she was joking. But later, seeing that there was still no trace of a smile on her face, and she hugged the child and walked back to her room without a word.</p>
<p>"This is really unexpected! I didn't know her temper was like this! Failed! Failed! I shouldn't have carelessly said the wrong word"!</p>
<p>Haiquan thought, since she is such a petty woman, then it would be better to apologize to her. So he also followed her into the room. He thought, he was going to participate in the demonstration parade this afternoon. If he was unlucky and was caught and sentenced by the ruling class to more than a year in prison, then he didn't know when he would be able to see them again. […], perhaps he would never see them again! Thinking of this, he felt sad again. He also thought that although he didn't feel that Qiuying was a very respectable woman, her heart was always good to him. On this point alone, he should happily maintain the friendship between the two.</p>
<p>"She is the only female friend I can see before participating in the demonstration parade!"</p>
<p>He inexplicably felt a burst of unnecessary sadness. In this instant, he regarded Qiuying as the incarnation of Peizhu and Madam Hezi.</p>
<p>He forgot her shallow and repulsive personality and felt that her demeanor was also somewhat moving.</p>
<p>"Madam, I said something wrong just now, I'm sorry. ·········"</p>
<p>"························"</p>
<p>But Qiuying sniffed and then exposed her breasts to feed the child, without saying a word, her face slightly lowered. But it could be seen that there were some smiles floating on her face. He thought, she is just playing this trick. A special impulse urged him to lean towards her.</p>
<p>The child, who had become familiar with him in the past few days, saw Haiquan approaching his mother, and threw away his mother's breast, turning around to giggle foolishly at Haiquan. Haiquan took the opportunity to lower his head and get closer to tease the child. His face almost touched her chest.</p>
<p>"He's eating milk!"</p>
<p>She smiled and scolded her child, putting the rose-colored nipple back into the child's mouth.</p>
<p>"Madam, are you angry with me like this? ·········"</p>
<p>"Who's angry with you? I'm not anything to you!"</p>

<p>— Zizhan</p>
<p>(15) Sichuanese and Tea</p>
<p>I previously wrote an article on Sichuanese and Opium, suspecting that the Chinese people's planting and consumption of opium originated with the Sichuanese. After reading Japanese scholar Yano Jinichi's "Modern Chinese Politics and Culture," which discusses the origin of Chinese people drinking tea, his research is precise and insightful, which inspired my thinking. I also suspect that the Chinese people's drinking of tea also originated with the Sichuanese. The ancient character did not have "tea," but only "tu." The character "tu" first appeared in the Book of Songs, such as "Who says tu is bitter? Its sweetness is like shepherd's purse." It is interpreted as a bitter vegetable, not belonging to the tree category. In the Erya's interpretation of trees, "jia" is "bitter tu." Guo Pu of the Jin Dynasty commented that the "jia" tree is small and similar to the gardenia. It produces leaves in winter that can be boiled into soup. Early picking is called "tu," and late picking is called "ming" or "chuan." People in Shu call it "bitter tu." This so-called "tu" is probably what we now call "tea." The Erya was traditionally said to have been written by the Duke of Zhou, supplemented by Confucius, added by Zixia, and supplemented by Shusun Tong. The Siku Quanshu Summary proves that its writing was after Mao Heng. It is mostly a compilation of old texts by philologists, which were gradually added to. To put it specifically, the earliest mention of drinking tea is found in the Erya. The practice of drinking tea began no later than the early Han Dynasty. The people of Shu called it "bitter tu," which can be said to be particularly knowledgeable of the taste. During the reign of Emperor Xuan of Han, Wang Bao wrote the "Slave Contract," which contains the phrases "roasting turtle and boiling tu" and "buying tu in Wuyang." Zhang Qiao of the Song Dynasty commented that the former "tu" is a bitter vegetable, and the latter "tu" is tea. Wuyang is Wang Bao's hometown, which now belongs to Pengshan County, Sichuan. Buying tea must be done in Wuyang. Could Wuyang have already been a famous tea-producing area at that time? Sun Chu's poem in the early Jin Dynasty also mentioned that Shu was the earliest place to produce tea. Zhang Qiao's interpretation of the "tu" in "buying tu in Wuyang" as tea is certainly not unreasonable. Zhang Zai of the Jin Dynasty was in Chengdu and wrote a poem when he ascended the White Rabbit Tower, saying, "May I ask about Yang Xiong's residence? I can imagine Sima Xiangru's hut." He also said, "Fragrant tea crowns the six pure [drinks], its flavor spreads throughout the nine regions. If life can be peaceful and happy, then this land can be enjoyed." Lu Yu of the Tang Dynasty, in his "Classic of Tea," listed famous figures who loved tea throughout history, saying, "In the Han Dynasty, there were Yang Xiong and Sima Xiangru." Sima Xiangru's "Fan Jiang Pian" has the character "chuan," and Wei Zhao's biography in the "Records of Wu" has the phrase "tu chuan to substitute for wine." The "Classic of Tea" also quotes Yang Xiong's "Dialects," saying that the people of Shu and the southwest call tea "she." Based on the above statements, it can be seen that since the Han Dynasty, when the custom of drinking tea first appeared, the people of Sichuan have had a special connection with tea. Sichuan was a famous tea-producing area, and the masters of prose and poetry in Shu, such as Sima Xiangru, Wang Bao, and Yang Xiong, were all famous tea lovers of the time.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Jiaotong University Industrial and Railway Exhibition Closed Yesterday <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Exhibition Meeting Held the Night Before Last</p>
<p>The National Jiaotong University Industrial and Railway Exhibition closed yesterday at 7:00 PM. At 9:00 AM, all faculty, staff, and students took a group photo on campus to commemorate the event. In the afternoon, there was a broadcast lecture titled "The Structure and Function of Lighthouses." After the lecture, a live demonstration was given in the factory shed on the main field. At 7:00 PM, faculty and staff had a dinner gathering. The exhibition lasted eleven days from its opening until yesterday. Xuhui Road was bustling with traffic, an unprecedented scene. The night before last, a special exhibition meeting was held, with speeches by both Chinese and foreign guests. Details of the events are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: The exhibition meeting was held in Rong Hong Hall conference hall at 7:00 PM the night before last. Attendees included: Mayor Wu Tiecheng, former Minister of Industry and Commerce Kong Xiangxi (represented by Zhu Maocheng), Mint Director Guo Chengen, Ministry of Finance Secretary Guo Dehua, Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen, Municipal Health Bureau Chief Li Tingan, Academia Sinica Zhou Zijing, Director of the Two Railways Machinery Bureau Wang Shenshan, Director of the Road Association Wu Shan. Foreign guests included Swiss Consul Lautai, US Commercial Counselor Enad, Austrian Consul General Okemao Le, American Chamber of Commerce President Kim, Belgian Chamber of Commerce President Hans, German Chamber of Commerce President Boerxian, Keber of Kong Shi Yangxing, Navili of Balu Steel Factory (represented by Chinese Lu Jun), Margen of Margen Yangxing, Skemida of Xiangshi Siemens Yangxing, Borden of Aoshipeng Yangxing, and representatives from various Chinese and foreign manufacturers participating in the exhibition, totaling 150 people, chaired by Li Zhaohuan.</p>
<p>Li Zhaohuan's Address: Tonight is the closing of the Industrial and Railway Exhibition. We are honored by your gracious presence. Our university has held exhibitions three times. The first time was during the university's 25th anniversary. At that time, the scale was very small, the number of participating manufacturers was limited, and the number of visitors was less than 60,000. Although this exhibition is being held during a time of serious national crisis, its scale is larger than before, with 205 participating manufacturers. Some foreign manufacturers were unable to participate due to late arrival, which is a pity. The strong interest and enthusiasm of the Chinese people for this event, and our painful decision to hold the meeting during the national crisis, all demonstrate that everything is possible if people put their minds to it. If we can unite and persevere, there is nothing in the world that we cannot achieve. As of last night, the number of Chinese and foreign visitors to the exhibition has reached 304,000. Children, servants, and those who entered without tickets are not included. We hope that the 40th anniversary will be even grander.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Address: I just heard Li Zhaohuan report that the number of participating manufacturers and visitors to this exhibition is very high. In recent years, when domestic and foreign troubles have been pressing down on us, there has been much destruction. However, the people's enthusiasm for supporting construction has not diminished, which is very gratifying. Every day we see various political and economic conflicts between countries in the newspapers, and China is not exempt from this. Tracing the root cause, it is mostly due to economic reasons. Such economic problems, in countries with developed industries, are due to overproduction and the excessive importance of capital utilization. Even in China, where various industries have not yet reached the stage of mechanization, we have already entered the whirlpool. The disease of other countries is overproduction, while China's problem is insufficient production. Therefore, if we want to solve the unrest in today's society, we must first solve the China problem. Solving the China problem will greatly benefit the solution of world problems. Our party's Sun Yat-sen advocated international cooperation to assist China, so that China can become the center of the world's economic problems and solve the world's disputes. Therefore, we must first build China and make China prosperous. Today, Jiaotong University has an industrial and railway exhibition. Although this exhibition is only a part, the spirit of international cooperation has a great impact on China's future.</p>
<p>Speeches by Consuls: The US Commercial Counselor briefly stated that he deeply understood that China's future is bright and immeasurable at the Jiaotong University Industrial and Railway Exhibition, and respectfully congratulated China and Jiaotong University on their future. He also raised his glass in congratulations. Then, Austrian Consul Okemao Le gave a brief speech, saying that the spirit of Jiaotong University is admirable, and that the students of Jiaotong University will surely become important figures in the construction of China in the future. Next, Director of the Central Mint En and Zhu Maodeng also delivered similar speeches. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>Ye Gongchuo's Address: Former President Ye Gongchuo gave a sincere training speech at the 37th anniversary meeting the other day. It is appended as follows: Today our university is holding the 37th anniversary ceremony. I happen to be in Shanghai and am very honored to be invited to participate by President Li. I have a few opinions on our university and would like to take this opportunity to express them. This anniversary is of great significance in the history of our university. You must all be very pleased to see the achievements of our university today, and I have even deeper hopes for the future of our university. Especially, I feel the close relationship between our university and the future of our country and society, so I would like to say a few sincere words, not ordinary generalities. Especially, my relationship with the duties of our university, although intermittent, has never been interrupted in spirit. Therefore, what I want to say today is only concerned with whether it is beneficial to our university, and whether it is pleasing to the ear is not a consideration. Our university has already had such achievements in the past, and may bring about even greater responsibilities in the future. Why is this? Because looking around the country, there is currently a great need for specialized academic talents everywhere. Our university has demonstrated achievements in various fields in the past, so all fields regard our university as a school that supplies talents for future construction. However, how our university should bear such a major responsibility is truly worthy of study. Although our university has a long history of 37 years, its development has only been in the last ten years. If we carefully examine the current content of our university, whether it has reached perfection, I am afraid no one would dare to say so. Therefore, for the past achievements of our university, we should thank the efforts of all faculty, staff, and students. For the responsibilities of our university, I hope you will continue to bear them. For example, just looking at the school buildings, this star needs to be renovated early. In addition, the Ping and Tang courtyards urgently need renovation, and the content needs to be sorted out and supplemented. These are too numerous to mention. Every time I think of the magnitude of future responsibilities, I feel that the content of our university must be further enriched. However, this matter cannot be done by one person or a few people in a short time. I hope that all faculty, staff, and students will work together to achieve the final goal. This is one of my hopes for our university. Secondly, our university has made many contributions to society in the past. Just take the example of radio. Although this science is very popular now, and there are many radio technology talents, in the past there were no such talents in the country, or it was even thought that there was no need for such talents. However, our university disregarded everything and created many radio talents for the country for today's use. From this point alone, it can be seen that the talents cultivated by our university are indeed beneficial to the country and society. However, social conditions are changing with each passing day, and the methods of schools in various countries to cultivate talents to meet the needs of the country and society are also increasing, and often schools and various undertakings are integrated. The teaching of schools and the training of institutions are integrated, so money and time are very economical. In the past, after students graduated and left school, they served in various fields and progressed according to their own circumstances. There was no fixed plan for both supply and demand, and the purpose was to cultivate talents. Therefore, the result is still the disease of uneconomical use of talents. In the future, schools and society must have a closer relationship. Students must be prepared and trained in school to serve the country and society in the future, so that after graduation, they can serve the country and society and be competent and happy. There are many things that can be learned from other countries in this regard. I sincerely hope that our university can adopt effective methods in the future to connect schools and social undertakings. This is my second hope for our university. In addition, there is one more opinion, which is about the academic atmosphere. Students of our university have excellent academic achievements, and their employment prospects can also win good reviews in society. However, what I want to say today is active, not passive. Each famous university in Europe and the United States has a special academic atmosphere. Although the beauty of our university's academic atmosphere has a place among the universities in the country, it has not yet produced a special atmosphere that other schools do not have. Our university has merged the three courtyards of Shanghai, Ping, and Tang into one university for ten years. However, because the courtyards are scattered in various places and each has a special history, they have not been able to integrate into one university in spirit. I sincerely hope that in the future, through the improvement of academic and educational systems, the three courtyards can be integrated into a whole organization, and from this whole organization, a unique spirit of Jiaotong University as a whole can be generated. This is my third hope for our university. Finally, regarding the issue of enriching the content of our university, I mentioned the issue of the research institute. Our country has never had a well-run research institute. If general university graduates are interested in further study, they must go abroad. Therefore, if our university wants to create a truly profound academic institution, it should quickly prepare to establish a very complete research institute to prepare the people of the country to study profound knowledge. This is my fourth hope for our university. Due to the limited time, what I have said above is only a brief outline. The details are not exhaustive. I hope you will pay attention to drawing inferences from one instance.</p>

<p>After the spring rain, it felt particularly refreshing. As early as 7:00 AM, people were coming to the Old West Gate in an endless stream, gradually gathering and crowding, and those standing by the road were blocking the way. Only heads could be seen moving. The Boy Scouts and the Municipal Police were doing their best to maintain order, so it was still orderly and not chaotic. The Republic Theater was temporarily used as headquarters, with the office located there.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Ten Thousand Horses Starting at the Ying Shi Pagoda <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>At 8:15 AM, more than 300 athletes lined up in two rows. At the command of the starter Jiang Xiangshu, ten thousand horses started together. Four motorcycles from the Municipal Public Security Bureau led the way, followed by bicycles of the Boy Scouts. For a moment, like a raging tide, they rushed forward together. In a few minutes, the swift-footed took the lead, and the slower ones fell behind, forming a long snake towards Xiaobeimen Minguo Road.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Two Heroes Advancing Side by Side at the New North Gate <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Starting from under the Ying Shi Pagoda, in no time they reached the New North Gate, a distance of 2,000 meters. The first person in the lead was Wang Zhenglin. Following Wang closely was Zhou Guangwu, about 100 meters behind. Xu Yanbo was about 100 meters behind Zhou Guangwu. After that were Zhang Yuanliang, Chen Linru, Xu Banghua, Yao Quanbo, Liao Shikui, Shen Xiongbin, Ling Qingzhang, Dong Jiaxie, and the remaining more than 300 people, coming in a line.</p>

<p>Passing the Little East Gate and turning south, and after passing the Great South Gate, the first person, Wang Zhenglin, began to increase his speed and stride forward. Wang was more than 100 meters ahead of Zhou Guangwu, and Zhou gradually fell behind. Xu Yanbo then passed forward, and Dong Jiaxie behind him also stepped up his pace and moved forward.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Division of the World in Three at Dalin Road <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Passing the Little West Gate, turned west and walked along Dalin Road and Manufacturing Bureau Road. At this time, the situation of the world had been determined. Wang Zhenglin still calmly remained in first place. The second person, Xu Yanbo, was more than 130 meters behind. Dong Jiaxie jumped to third place, another 100 meters behind Xu. After that were Zhou Guangwu, Chen Linru, the two rickshaw pullers Zhang Yuanliang and Gao Zhifang.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Cheers Erupted at the Public Utilities Bureau <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>From the Manufacturing Bureau, they went straight west along Xietu Road, straight to the Public Utilities Bureau. The top three remained unchanged. Zhou Guangwu gradually fell behind, and Liu Xueming and Lin Quanbo tried their best to catch up. Upon reaching the finish line in front of the Public Utilities Bureau, the champion Wang Zhenglin was 150 meters ahead of Xu Yanbo. Dong Jiaxie was 250 meters behind Xu, taking third place. Chen Linru was 200 meters behind Dong, ranking fourth. The rickshaw puller Zhang Yuanliang was another 30 meters behind. Liu Xueming and Lin Quanbo arrived one after another. Zhou Guangwu fell to ninth place, and the rickshaw puller Gao Zhifang ranked eighth. Fifty-two winners were selected, accounting for 15% of the total.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Rickshaw Pullers Made a Splash <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Among the more than 300 heroes, the most eye-catching was the rickshaw puller Gao Zhifang, who won eighth place. Gao was still behind the fifteenth place at the Little East Gate at 2,000 meters, but by the time he reached Dalin Road, he had already caught up to seventh place. Finally, he won eighth place. His hard work and competition were commendable. However, his posture showed at a glance that he was a rickshaw puller. Upon reaching the finish line, Gao smiled and said that it was just a small test. There was also Zhang Yuanliang, who won fifth place and was also a rickshaw puller, hired by Yan Zhongwen. It can be said that they complemented each other.</p>

<p>After the Chief Referee Shen Siliang had carefully examined the results, the awards ceremony was held. Chen Bai was the master of ceremonies, chaired by Mayor Wu Tiecheng. Then the Mayor gave a speech, briefly stating that today is the second long-distance race organized by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. Last year it was not held due to the Shanghai war, and it was postponed to today. The number of participants reached 489, while the previous session only had more than 180. This session has participants from all walks of life, including industry, commerce, medicine, and academia. This is a good sign of the popularization of sports. Our country is the country with the highest civilization, but at present, it is also one of the weakest and most oppressed countries in the world. If the country has reached this point, the nation cannot struggle to find a way out. The sick man of East Asia is actually self-inflicted. Today's rulers are not without the desire to struggle, but are limited by their knowledge or other reasons. However, if you want to struggle, you must have a strong physique. Looking back at the youth across the country, the atmosphere of sports is vigorous and the interest is strong. I am very happy for the future of China. The only hope for China in the future rests on the struggling youth of today. His vigilant words were moving. Lin Meiyan, representative of the Municipal Party Department, followed. Honorary instructor Ling Xitao also gave a speech. Chief referee Shen Siliang reported the results, and then Mayor Wu awarded the prizes and inquired kindly to the children, showing his concern.</p>

<p>Portugal Loses 7-2</p>
<p>Over Seven Thousand Spectators Enjoyed a Splendid Performance</p>
<p>Sun Jinshun and Li Yichen Excelled in Shooting</p>
<p>The Sino-Portuguese Cup football match, which has a long history, was revived this year. The first match took place yesterday at 3 PM at the Chinese Baseball Field. Despite the cloudy weather and continuous spring rain, the audience turnout was still very enthusiastic. Father Road was bustling, and cars jammed the streets. The stands around the field were filled, reaching over seven thousand spectators. Both teams were well-organized, and the performance was splendid. Cheers and shouts sounded like ten thousand horses galloping and mountains collapsing. In the end, China defeated Portugal by a large margin of 7-2. The performances of both sides were extremely exciting, but due to the heavy rain, the field was waterlogged and slippery, hindering running. The ball, soaked in mud and water, was excessively heavy, making it difficult to run fast or kick far, which was a slight imperfection. The details of the match are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Strength of Both Teams: Portugal has a well-established reputation and is indeed extraordinary. Although they lost, their performance was still commendable. Gu Shitan, Remy Di, and Kola Sa, among others, were exceptionally brave. For the Chinese team, Chen Zhenhe did not play, and Wan Xianghua took the left wing. The forwards worked diligently like a machine, and the defense was tight and impeccable. The goal-scoring skills of Sun Jinshun and Li Yichen were particularly praiseworthy. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Team:</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Wang Shusen, Shang Guanxun, Liang Shutang, Feng Yunyou, Tu Kaiyuan, Wan Xianghua, Sun Jinshun, Li Yichen, Chen Jiaqiu, Chen Yutian</p>
<p>Portuguese Team:</p>
<p>Marcel P, Gu Shitan (replaced by Ge Tielie), A Remy Di (replaced by Gu Shitan), A Kola Sa, Remy Di (replaced by A Gu Shitan), Hukui Na (replaced by Gao Shannu), Na Te, Ti Na, H Kola Sa, Lang Ge'er, Luolai</p>
<p>China Suffers Initial Setback: China kicked off first, attacking aggressively. Portugal pressed aggressively, displaying extraordinary bravery. China defended effectively, remaining unshaken. Li Huochen and Sun Zhushun led counterattacks but returned without success. Portugal encroached from the flank, and Luolai passed the ball from the baseline in front of the goal. Kola Sa, about seven or eight away from the goal, received the ball and shot, expecting to score, but it was blocked by Zhou Xianyan, a close call indeed. China thought they could rest easy, but one wave followed another. The Portuguese army attacked through the middle, passing the ball several times before Kola unleashed a powerful shot. The ball grazed the goalpost and entered the net. Zhou Xianyan fell to the ground but failed to save it, resulting in a loss of one goal. The audience was stunned.</p>
<p>Equalizing with Two Goals: After China conceded a goal, they kicked off from the center, attacking directly into the Portuguese territory. The front line was coordinated and responsive. However, due to the slippery ground, they struggled to maintain control. Feng Yunyou advanced backward, and amidst the chaotic scrum, Lao Feng executed a surprise attack, scoring a goal in return. From then on, China's momentum grew stronger. Wan Xianghua charged along the flank but was blocked by the enemy. He immediately lobbed the ball to Sun Jinshun, who sprinted forward, dribbling the ball towards the goal. However, he was again blocked by Gu Shitan, who then passed the ball to Li Yichen. Li succeeded in one go, scoring another goal, making it 2-1.</p>
<p>Another Goal: After that, Wan Xianghua once made a solo incursion, attacking the goal without success. If he had passed the ball to Li Yichen, who was waiting in front of the goal, a goal would have been certain. After a long scrum, Chen Yutian launched an attack from the flank, lobbing the ball towards the center. Yichen got the ball but lost it due to the slippery ground. Sun Jinshun charged forward and scored. Yichen was already offside, but the referee, being far behind, failed to observe closely. China thus gained an advantage with a score of 3-1. The Portuguese army repeatedly attempted to score, shooting many times, but fortunately, Zhou Xianyan's saves were effective, and the interception of the Li and Wang generals were thorough, leaving no room for error, so the Portuguese army could do nothing.</p>
<p>Each Scores Once: After the break, for the first ten minutes, neither side could find an opportunity to score, and there were few close calls. However, the momentum was still strong, and the spirit was consistent, so the interest did not diminish. Then, Li Yichen penetrated deep into the side of the goal and returned the ball in front of the goal. Sun Jinshun swept forward but missed. Soon after, Sun Jinshun had another opportunity and finally scored. The ball flew into the corner of the goal in an arc, which was very beautiful. Both sides fought with more and more spirit, and the delicate voices of the audience never stopped. The noble female guests in the one-yuan seats were ecstatic and watched with great interest, and their delicate voices and shouts added a lot of color to the stadium. Suddenly, the entire Portuguese team invaded the Chinese territory. The Chinese defense worked hard to resist, twisting into a ball, and Zhou Xianyan finally broke free and threw the ball out, turning danger into safety. But Kola Sa made a comeback and shot a quick goal, hitting the target, making it 4-2.</p>
<p>Three Consecutive Goals: Afterwards, the Portuguese army's arrogance slightly weakened. Although everyone was still working hard and competing, the front line showed signs of chaos, indicating they were unable to hold on. Li Yichen and Sun Jinshun of China scored three consecutive goals, doubling their prestige. Each goal was shot with power, unlike ordinary goals. Since China had won 7-2, they no longer sought more goals and simply managed the remaining minutes. The next match is scheduled for Saturday (the 15th). Who will win the Sino-Portuguese Cup? Let's wait for the next installment.</p>

<p>Result: 43-33</p>
<p>Saint Thomas University Team Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Departing for Japan This Morning</p>
<p>A Group of Fifteen Will Compete in Sixteen Baseball Games in Japan</p>
<p>The Saint Thomas University expedition team from the Philippines arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 2 PM aboard the Russian Empress ship. They disembarked at the New Customs Wharf, where they were welcomed by Shi Zhaokang, a representative of the National Sports Association, and sports reporters from various newspapers. After landing, they went out to shop and took a short break at the Sichuan Road YMCA. At 7:30 PM that evening, they went to the Chinese Basketball Hall to compete against the Donghua basketball team. Despite the long journey and hardship, they defeated Donghua with a score of 43-33, demonstrating their strength. After finishing the basketball game last night, the team boarded the original ship and left Shanghai at 8 AM this morning, heading to Japan. They will land in Nagasaki and are scheduled to compete in sixteen baseball games in Japan before heading to Honolulu for competition and then returning to the Philippines. The detailed information is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Expedition Schedule: The team of fifteen departed from Manila, Philippines, at 4 PM on April 3rd. They arrived in Hong Kong at noon on the 5th, where they competed in two basketball games and one baseball game. They left Hong Kong at noon on the 7th, arriving in Shanghai yesterday. They competed against Donghua in basketball last night and left Shanghai at 8 AM this morning, heading to Japan. They will land in Nagasaki and are scheduled to compete in sixteen baseball games in Japan before heading to Honolulu in late May or early June. They are expected to return to the Philippines around mid-July.</p>
<p>Team Members: The team leader is Rong Shi (Capt. DYond). The player roster is as follows: Pai Taixin, Bao De Si Tai, Na Tai'er, Santos, Ke Lie Na, Ya Xintai, Sa Balong, Bie Erba, Man De Na, Shi Tan Lusha, Bo Langte, Feng Taiweila, Ge Mubo, Xue Erfan. A total of fifteen people.</p>
<p>Baseball Strength: The team's goal is to compete in baseball in Japan and Honolulu. Basketball is just a warm-up act. Their baseball strength is very strong, with many members from the previous Far Eastern Games. This time, they are newly crowned champions of the three major universities and runners-up in the All-Philippines professional baseball league.</p>
<p>Basketball Strength: Although basketball is their warm-up act, their strength is also very strong. They are also champions of the three major university basketball leagues in Manila and winners of the Manila Basketball Championship organized by the Philippine Amateur Athletic Association. They are tied with the Alenio team. Because the competition was divided into two divisions, they and the Alenio each won one division, but the final has not been decided. Xue Erfan, Ge Gou, Man De Na, and Ya Xintai, who played last night, are all official members of the championship team.</p>
<p>Record in Hong Kong: After arriving in Hong Kong, the team competed against the South China team, the Hong Kong basketball champion, at the YMCA. The team won 42-28. The next day, they competed against the Hong Kong basketball runner-up, and the team won 58-42. In baseball, they played against the South China Club, winning 12-3.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Basketball Victory Over Donghua Last Night <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday, the team went to the Chinese Basketball Hall at 7:30 PM to compete against the Donghua basketball team, formerly known as the Shanghai University team. News of the game spread, and basketball enthusiasts flocked to the event, filling the basketball hall to the brim. The scene was even more grand than the All-Nations Basketball Finals. The Philippine team's skills were extraordinary. They ran like hungry tigers pouncing on food and jumped like soaring birds. Their agility and quickness were amazing. Their work under the basket was particularly effective, passing and shooting from the crowd in an unpredictable manner. The Donghua team, formerly the Shanghai University team, plus the veteran Lu Zhongen, had improved significantly. Their performance was also excellent. However, in comparison, they were no match for the Philippine team. The Philippine team was strong and tough. Although Donghua once tied the score, the team was not discouraged. They had a plan and seemed confident of victory. Therefore, in the end, the Philippine team won 43-33. The referees were Zhang Guoxun and Li Zuqi.</p>
<p>Equal Start: Under the bright lights and cheers of the ladies, the two teams began their attack. Donghua took the lead, with Feng Nianhua and Qian Jingzhu scoring two consecutive goals, creating a strong momentum. The Philippine team displayed their skills, demonstrating the beauty of passing and attacking, earning applause from the audience, who marveled at the spectacle. However, the court was not heated, and the shots were often not satisfactory, so they had to temporarily concede. Donghua took the lead with 7-3, but by the end of the first quarter, the Philippine team managed to tie the score at 9-9.</p>
<p>Philippine Team Takes the Lead: After a short break, the game continued. Feng Nianhua scored again, taking the lead once more. But as the saying goes, "The weather is unpredictable, and people have unexpected misfortunes." Wu Guolin suddenly injured his foot and had to retire, replaced by Lu Zhongen. Lu Zhongen switched to center, and the lineup inevitably loosened. The Philippine team launched a fierce attack, with Ge Mubo scoring three consecutive goals and Pai Taixin adding two points, suddenly surpassing Donghua 17-13. At this time, Wu Guolin, whose foot had recovered, re-entered the court, facing the challenge. Lu Zhongen and Qian Jingzhu added two goals, while the Philippine team scored another five points. At the end of the first half, the Philippine team had 22 points, and Donghua had 17 points.</p>
<p>Intense Battle: Switching sides and continuing the game, the Philippine team replaced their center and left forward. After Ge Mubo scored two goals, Donghua suddenly gained momentum. Sun Maiqing scored two consecutive free throws, and Feng Nianhua added three points, suddenly making the score 24-26. Donghua seemed to have found life in a desperate situation, and their spirits were high. The audience also became more excited, thinking that they could make a comeback and regain their pride. However, the performance in this quarter was greatly reduced. The lineups of both sides were scattered, and the actions became too rash and fierce amidst the intense sounds, lacking the previous clarity and beauty.</p>
<p>Final Victory: In the last quarter, the Philippine team still used the official lineup from the first half. Donghua desperately sought victory and launched a fierce counterattack. The Philippine team was unwilling to show weakness and responded with eye contact, competing with each other, each refusing to yield. They fought so hard that everyone was panting and sweating like rain. The Philippine team was able to respond everywhere, and once again took the lead with 33-27. After Donghua's Qian Jingzhu scored, Feng Nianhua made two long shots, and everyone was spirited and full of enthusiasm. Lu Zhongen scored another free throw, suddenly making the score 33-33, with no clear winner. At this point, Donghua thought they could secure victory, but the Philippine team did not panic. Xu Tu Hongzhan, Xue Erfan scored four consecutive goals, Ya Xintai added one, and in an instant, they scored ten consecutive points. Donghua then lost the game, with the score being 33-43.</p>

<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Business Conditions</p>
<p>In addition to general modern doctors, let's talk about the business of members of the so-called Western Medical Association. Their business skills are often very good, their publicity is strong, and their fees are very economical, so their business is also very busy. To be fair, some of them are quite skilled at giving injections. Other than that, there is no apparent difference between their outpatient and home visits and those of other doctors, except for a few true characteristics: (A) Members of the Western Medical Association are quite capable of prescribing old-fashioned decoctions; (B) There are no formal hospitals run by members of the Western Medical Association in Shanghai, nor are there any members of the association serving as chief physicians in any public or private hospitals; (C) The association has no publications, nor are there any papers written by members of the association; (D) Members of the association who claim to be specialists are mostly in venereal diseases, and some claim to be specialists in leukorrhea, while other specialties are rarely seen; (E) No members of the association serve as professors in medical schools and teach Western medicine. Therefore, it can be said that members of the Western Medical Association are not restricted in their business compared to other modern doctors, but there are some differences in their background and level of knowledge. This phenomenon is prone to occur in the transitional era of any country and should be remedied by the government, society, and the medical community itself, rather than being completely dismissed. It is hoped that members of the Western Medical Association will also recognize this path in order to have hope of improving Chinese medicine. If you think that my chatter today is intentionally demeaning the members of the association, then there is nothing I can do. There is also a chapter on medical administration below, which describes the clues in more detail. If you read it calmly, you will understand. (B) The Business of the New Pharmaceutical Industry</p>
<p>As for the business of the new pharmaceutical industry, it was very undeveloped more than 30 years ago. In addition to the pharmacies opened by foreigners, which were exclusively for foreign nationals and foreign doctors, the number of pharmacies run by Chinese was very small. Zhongxi, Zhongying, and several other companies were already very old brands. At that time, because the number of modern doctors was not large, some people prescribed and dispensed medicine themselves, so the only business of each pharmacy was to sell European and American tested medicines (now called over-the-counter drugs) and also sell cosmetics, perfumes, and foreign goods. To this day, pharmacies in the interior still sell towels and umbrellas, which is the tradition of that time. Later, some pharmacies promoted their own over-the-counter drugs on a large scale and used publicity methods, which aroused the suspicion of countless people. Huang Chujiu's Sino-French Pharmacy produced Ailuo Brain Tonic, which earned him the nickname "sly." In fact, Ailuo Brain Tonic was just a foreign over-the-counter drug manufactured in China. Huang only used the psychology of the Chinese people's worship of foreigners, using more Western names and adding some Western colors, without other deceptive acts. However, to this day, how many speculative drug dealers are there on the market? How many deceptive drugs are there on the market? On the contrary, I have never heard of a third or fourth sly person coming out of Shanghai. This situation can prove on the one hand that the world is not as good as it used to be; on the other hand, it can prove that foreign science is developing day by day, while the scientific knowledge of our people cannot keep up, so the ability of society to distinguish between right and wrong is becoming weaker and weaker, which is really heartbreaking. In the past decade, due to the increase and progress of modern doctors, the new pharmaceutical industry has naturally expanded as well. The added categories are dispensing merchants, drug dealers, over-the-counter drug merchants, and pharmaceutical factories. The improved category is that dispensing merchants have gradually moved from apprentice workers to experts and academics, and all pharmacies have pharmacists. Drug dealers have also changed from selling foreign general merchandise to specializing in pharmaceuticals.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Reasons for Difficulty in Curing Gonorrhea and Correct Treatment Methods (Part 2) <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Yunshou</p>
<p>(4) Everything else: There are many other reasons. First, the patient waits for the acute symptoms of gonorrhea to pass and it becomes chronic. Because there is no pain, they are unwilling to continue treatment to eradicate the disease. Second, the patient does not understand the way to maintain health (see my book "Sexual Disease Pointer" sold by Datong Bookstore). Third, there is the economic problem of not being able to seek medical treatment for a long time. Fourth, there is the occupational relationship, which makes it inconvenient to seek medical treatment. Fifth, the couple cannot seek medical treatment at the same time, resulting in a situation of mutual infection. Sixth, there is the reason for trusting all improper treatments, which leads to prolonging the time to cure.</p>
<p>The above has explained the reasons why gonorrhea is difficult to cure and the advantages and disadvantages of all treatments. Then, how do we find the most correct treatment method? Now I will record it item by item below:</p>
<p>(1) Abortive therapy: The earlier gonorrhea is treated, the more effective it is. It is best to inject a bactericidal drug into the urethra within one or two days of gonorrhea infection (that is, one or two days after unclean intercourse), before there are any conscious symptoms or pus discharge. It can be cured in just a few days. This is called abortive therapy. However, most patients who come to the doctor for treatment already have pain and a large amount of pus discharge. At this time, the gonococci on the urethra are not only on the mucous membrane, but have already invaded the tissues under the mucous membrane. If they can be treated in an orderly manner, it is not difficult to cure gonorrhea.</p>
<p>(2) Local treatment: Gonococci are in the urethra, so washing and dripping medicine into the urethra is naturally the most important thing. Although there are many drugs that can be used, in principle, when there are gonococci, bactericides should be used, and when the gonococci are eliminated and the inflammation has not subsided, astringents should be used. At the same time, it is necessary to observe the patient's condition and the nature of the urine, and the type of drug, the number of injections, the amount of injection, the concentration, and the time of staying in the urethra should be adjusted accordingly. There is no fixed procedure. The length of treatment depends entirely on the doctor's use of drug methods. Often, if the gonococci have been eliminated and a strong bactericide is injected again, or if there are many gonococci and a mild drug is used, not only will it not be effective, but it will increase the disease or prolong the time to cure. Therefore, it is necessary to use a microscope to check the gonococci and observe the changes in the urine. This is the standard for selecting the type and dosage of drugs and everything else.</p>
<p>Also, the injected drugs should not only kill the gonococci on the surface of the urethral mucosa, but also kill the gonococci lurking in various glands or collateral tubules (described later).</p>
<p>In chronic gonorrhea, the urethral tissue has been infiltrated. Even if drugs are injected daily, it is still not effective. At that time, other methods must be found to make the drug easily enter.</p>
<p>(3) Injection method: Such as the use of yellow pigment vaccine, etc., are all auxiliary methods for treating gonorrhea.</p>
<p>(4) Urethroscopy examination: Understanding the nature of the urethral tissue mentioned above, we can know that gonococci are easy to lurk in the urethral collateral tubules, Littre's glands, and other parts. The reason why gonorrhea recurs later due to drinking, fatigue, or intercourse is due to this. Therefore, when the urethritis has been roughly cured, or when it is chronic and difficult to cure, is it not an important thing to use a urethroscope to check the lesions of gonorrhea (lesions are the nests of pathogens)?</p>
<p>(5) Surgical treatment: Since there are lesions in the urethra, which are the basis for the recurrence of gonorrhea, after checking with a urethroscope, use a small sharp knife to cut it open to break the lesions, or drip medicine.</p>
<p>(6) "Buqi" therapy: "Buqi" is a metal curved rod made in various sizes. After urethral surgery, the wound is healed, and the "Buqi" is inserted to stretch the wrinkles in the urethra, and the injected medicine can reach the entire mucosal surface and the inside of the collateral tubule sinus glands. Moreover, the stimulation of the "Buqi" improves the blood circulation of the urethral tissue and produces healthy epithelium. Before and after gonorrhea treatment, the application of "Buqi" is also very important. (7) Oral medicine: Although there is no specific medicine for oral medicine, it can also help a lot. What medicine to use can only be adapted to the circumstances.</p>
<p>(8) Malaria treatment: Now there is a malaria treatment for stubborn gonorrhea, but there are not many test results and the application is not widespread.</p>
<p>(9) Prostate: The prostate gland is often the nest of gonococci. Prostate examination and treatment is also very important.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Observations on the Current State of Medicine (Part 2) <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Jilin</p>
<p>As for why new medicine cannot fully gain the trust of the general public, there are several reasons. First, our people have always had a kind of self-sufficient mentality. Things and knowledge imported from abroad, regardless of whether they are good or bad, are regarded as foreign studies. Not only do we not learn from them, but we also absolutely attack and reject them. For example, Western machine industry is indeed better than China's, but the general public is always unwilling to wholeheartedly say, "We are really not as good as them." Instead, they insist on saying, "Although their material civilization is better than ours, our spiritual civilization seems to be better than theirs." Medicine is also like this; many people know that Western medicine is better than traditional Chinese medicine, but they are still unwilling to admit defeat, saying: "Western medicine focuses on substantial research, while Chinese medicine focuses on spiritual observation. Western medicine is certainly better than Chinese medicine in surgery, but it is far inferior to Chinese medicine in internal medicine." This is the first point. Second, the nature of our people is conservative and restorationist. The phenomenon since the Enlightenment is still the same phenomenon today. Medicine is certainly no exception; the Huangdi Neijing (Huangdi's Internal Classic) of thousands of years ago is still popular today. How Western medicine has improved and developed has not been noticed at all. It is considered that our responsibility is completed as long as we conserve our inherent medicine. Recently, traditional Chinese medicine, which calls for preserving national essence (?), can enable our country's declining medicine to gain the advocacy and approval of a part of the people, because their arguments are in line with the unique conservative and restorationist mentality of our people. The failure of Western medicine to become popular is also a great obstacle. This is the second point. Third, since traditional Chinese medicine has been in society for so many years, the general public knows a little about medical terms related to traditional Chinese medicine; for example, when we ask about their illness, they say that my liver fire is too strong, or that my kidney water is greatly deficient. There are also very profound terms such as blood heat and yin cold, which are constantly spoken out. This kind of situation is always encountered by newly qualified doctors; if they are told that their disease is gastritis or neurasthenia, they will definitely not believe it. As for medicines, many of the medicines in the prescriptions prescribed by traditional Chinese medicine are known to them to some extent; while in new medicine, except for a few common advertised medicines such as Zilai Xuetan pills, the general public has no knowledge at all; they already have a skeptical attitude towards new medicine, and at the same time they are asked to take medicines that they don't understand, so how can this arouse their faith? This is the third point. Fourth, the price of Western medicine is too high. On the one hand, because many Western medicines cannot be manufactured in China and are imported from abroad, the price is naturally more expensive; on the other hand, there are many unscrupulous people in new medicine who are too欺人 too甚 (oppressive) He knows that the society does not know the price of Western medicine, and sometimes he arbitrarily rip off the customers. This is still the medicine aspect. As for the consultation fee, the Chinese and Western medicine in big cities is of course almost the same, but the new doctors in small cities</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The cost of home visits is often several times higher than that of traditional Chinese medicine. How can people not be discouraged? In the era of the 20th century, people who are stirred up by the new trend must embrace the purpose of reforming the era. The evolution of mankind from the savage era to the civilized era is the result of continuous reform; if we only stick to the old phenomena, isn't it still a savage era? Therefore, I am extremely opposed to traditional Chinese medicine, which is outdated and does not know how to improve, but what methods can be used to gradually popularize new medicine with a spirit of improvement and adaptation to the trend in the society? First, I hope that our country should have its own manufactured medicines, and not rely on foreign supply; on the one hand, it can make up for a big leak; on the other hand, the price can be low, so that ordinary people will not dare to ask for advice because the medicine is expensive. Second, the government should strictly register traditional Chinese medicine; as for the scholarly school that kills people with ancient prescriptions, the quack school that talks nonsense, and the drug store buddy school that is neither donkey nor horse, they should all be severely cracked down on. Third, set up more public hospitals so that the general public can get the opportunity to see a doctor. Finally, I have a word to advise all new doctors. If you want scientific new medicine to be popularized in the society, you must first take the responsibility of reforming medicine, step by step forward from the dark road, and strive to eliminate all obstacles. Second, we must respect the inherent morality of doctors and arouse the faith of the general public. Third, we must truly unite with the people and make new medicine become the medicine of the public.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Scientific Guide to Safe Childbirth (12) <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>(C) Common Sense and Key Points During Childbirth</p>
<p>(1) Bowel and Bladder Movements After the Onset of Labor Pains</p>
<p>When labor pains recur, that is, at the beginning of labor, whether or not there has been a bowel movement, an enema must be performed first, and urination should be done from time to time.</p>
<p>Because of the force exerted during bowel movements, there is a risk of ruptured membranes. A bedpan should be used and can be done in bed. In the early stages of labor, urination can be done at the discretion of the parturient. It is okay to go to the toilet. If the cervix has opened to three centimeters, she should be ordered to lie on her back to urinate. If urination is difficult, a urinary catheter can be used.</p>
<p>Why should we pay so much attention to bowel and bladder movements? Because the accumulation of bowel and bladder movements can easily induce weak labor pains, which hinders the progress of labor, so it should not be neglected.</p>
<p>(2) Getting Up and Moving Around</p>
<p>When the labor pains are not severe, the parturient can get up and move around at will. First-time mothers may as well take a walk indoors.</p>
<p>If the cervix has dilated to three centimeters, she must be ordered to lie down, because sitting up at this time may cause premature rupture of membranes: there is a risk of prolapse of the upper limbs or umbilical cord.</p>
<p>If a multipara has had a rapid labor history in the past, or has a suspended fetus, or has a history of bleeding, then; at the beginning of labor, she must be ordered to lie on her back to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Young women, at their first delivery, or impatient multiparas, if they cannot restrain their fear, resulting in terror, irritability, and extreme anxiety, then; they should be advised from the side and explained as much as possible. It can be said; that childbirth is a natural physiological process and there is no danger, so you can rest assured and don't worry. If fear is unsettling, then it is dangerous instead.</p>
<p>Sometimes, during the dilation phase, the labor pains gradually weaken or even stop completely. If the parturient wants to sleep, and there are no other concerns, she may as well be allowed to sleep peacefully, so as to rest, wait for her to wake up once, and she can recover her energy, add strength, and then start strong labor pains again.</p>
<p>(3) Pushing Too Early</p>
<p>The parturient often uses abdominal pressure during the dilation phase. This is not only harmful but also useless, and it can easily make the parturient tired, and it can also easily cause weak labor pains. It can also cause early rupture of membranes or spastic labor pains. As a result, the progress of labor is delayed and the pain is increased instead. Therefore, at the beginning of labor, early pushing (abdominal pressure) is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>(4) Diet</p>
<p>The parturient often does not want to eat because of the labor pains, but there are also many people who want to eat. If it is predicted that the labor process may be prolonged, it is okay to give a small amount of food, but avoid too much, such as: thin porridge, lotus root starch, egg, milk, soup, bread, etc. The drink is clear tea, clean water, avoid strong tea, coffee and alcohol. If you are tired, you can use a little wine.</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Aesthetics and Scientific Protection of Breasts (Part 2) <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The Breast Band is the Protection of Beautiful Form</p>
<p>Among the various methods of protecting the position and shape of the breasts, the most necessary is to use a breast band that is suitable for oneself. Although there are ready-made breast bands sold in Western countries, because they are all the same style, of course, there is no reason why everyone can wear them flat and suitable. Breast bands that are not flat and suitable are useless. On the one hand, the breast band does not allow clothes to rub and stimulate the breasts: on the other hand, it fixes the breasts on the chest, that is, even when the body is moving, there will be no unnecessary and unpleasant shaking: especially it can prevent sagging. When walking slowly, walking fast, jumping, and bending over, if the breasts shake, this is not only unsightly, but also pulls the breast's attachment tissues, and it will feel painful.</p>
<p>What Style of Breast Band is Appropriate</p>
<p>To protect beautiful breasts; to cover up breasts that have already sagged, so as not to be ugly, and to sag even more; then a well-fitting breast band is necessary. The breast band is made of strong, loose and elastic cloth, and the lower edge is inlaid with rubber, so that breathing and upper limb movement will not feel difficult. The straps hanging on the shoulders should not be too narrow to avoid embedding in the flesh. Because the breasts will swell a little during menstruation, they should be made so that they can be tightened and loosened for adjustment.</p>
<p>Corset and Corslet</p>
<p>For fat, sagging breasts, ordinary breast bands are not suitable. Pressing heavy breasts on the chest: makes breathing difficult; and the straps also have to be embedded in the shoulders; so it is harmful instead. A Corset (belly band) must be used to support it from below. However, old-fashioned Corsets, which squeeze up the breasts and make the ugliness even more obvious, cannot be used: it is best to use a Corslet (longer vest) recently, which tightens the chest and abdomen together.</p>
<p>The Disadvantages of Sagging Breasts</p>
<p>Severely sagging breasts are not only unsightly and inconvenient for work, but also harmful to health. Obese women, because of this kind of fatty breast, the body increases even more, movement is not free, and it presses the chest: hinders breathing; harms the heart's activity; causes back pain; eczema is easy to grow under the breasts and ulcerate.</p>
<p>The History of Breast Cutting</p>
<p>Breast cutting, in ancient times, was a punishment inflicted on women. In the 194th chapter of the Code of Hammurabi, the king of Babylon in 2250 BC, it can also be clearly seen. Female warriors often cut off their right breasts in their youth in order to make the movement of their right arms free, especially to facilitate throwing stones. There were also those who burned both breasts as children in order to adapt to weapons. Some sects cut off the breasts of women serving the gods in order to prevent sexual stimulation from being spread by the breasts.</p>
<p>The Creation of Breast Beauty and Modern Medical Techniques</p>
<p>A part of modern women, in order to increase their physical beauty, fervently demanded breast cutting; and the popular style in 1932 was thin and slender, so women who sell physical beauty; women who felt that large breasts were inconvenient in their professions; and even women of the leisured class who did not want to lag behind; all excused themselves on the grounds that they were harmful to health and asked for plastic surgery, so the doctor's scalpel was placed on the breasts. Modern medical technology is advanced, so it is possible not to cut off the breasts, on the one hand, to maintain its function, and on the other hand, to cut off excess fat and delayed skin, and change it to a suitable position, beautiful and even shape. Inverted nipples are not only unsightly in form, but also difficult to breastfeed, so now there is plastic surgery to make the nipples protrude.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Several Important Discoveries and Inventions in the Development of New Medicine (3) <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Shoubai</p>
<p>In addition to general anesthetics, the rest are local anesthetics.</p>
<p>There are also two kinds of local anesthetics. The first is cryoanesthesia. Because a part of the body is frozen, it can completely lose consciousness. This cryoanesthesia method was first created by J. Arnott in 1848. At that time, he only used a mixture of ice and snow. Although this mixture can also be used, it may not always be effective. In 1866, Sir Benjamin Ward Richardson invented a more convenient method. He used a special atomizer to spray extremely pure alcohol essence into a fine mist towards the local area. At this time, the alcohol essence evaporates extremely quickly, and it takes away a lot of warmth from this local area, making the skin freeze, turn white and harden. This cryoanesthesia method is still used today. However, because ethyl chloride can make tissues freeze faster, it is often used to replace alcohol essence.</p>
<p>Another local anesthesia method is to use a certain drug to paralyze the local nerves. "Cocaine" was the first of these drugs to be adopted by the medical community in 1884. In recent years, there have been many improved preparations, such as "Novocaine" and "Eucaine", which are more effective and more widely used than "Cocaine". These drugs are made into solutions of appropriate concentration and injected into the skin. After two or three minutes, this local area can lose consciousness. When these drugs are applied to the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat and nasal cavity, and inside the eye, as long as they are applied to the surface, there is no need for injection, and they already have the effect of paralyzing consciousness.</p>
<p>Recently, there is also a spinal anesthesia method. As long as a solution of anesthetic drugs such as "Cocaine" is injected under the spinal membrane in the lumbar canal, the nerves in the lower half of the body can completely lose consciousness. At this time, although the patient is awake, he does not feel the pain of the operation at all. For example, most hemorrhoidectomies have recently adopted this spinal anesthesia method. There is also rectal anesthesia, which has only recently been successfully tested. Although some people used liquid or vaporous alcohol essence to inject into the rectum in the past, trying to perform general anesthesia, the results all failed. In 1926, Butzengeiger used "Avertin" for rectal anesthesia. The following year, he published the results in detail. After that, many German surgeons used this method to perform surgery. This rectal anesthesia method can be used for operations on the head, neck, especially struma, Basedow's disease, and operations on the thorax and spine; however, there seem to be many objections to the application of this anesthesia method to visceral surgery.</p>
<p>(2) Antiseptic Sterilization Method</p>
<p>The main reason for the great progress of foreign science in the 19th century, in addition to the invention of the use of anesthetics, is also closely related to the invention of antiseptic sterilization methods.</p>
<p>In the past, suppuration of wounds was considered to be the result of contact between putrid air and the wound. Later, it was discovered that this observation was wrong. Experiments proved that there were germs in the air, making the public know that the air itself was not the cause of suppuration, thus causing a great revolution in surgery. It cannot be said that this was not the credit of Joseph Lister. Now let me briefly record the process of Lister's invention of the antiseptic method.</p>
<p>Lister's father was a wine merchant in London, but he was very interested in making optical instruments. Later, he actually invented colorless lenses, which became a great contribution to modern scientific research. As for Lister himself, he paid close attention to Pasteur's theory that "there are microorganisms in the air that can cause various diseases, and that sepsis and pyemia are also caused by this." Therefore, he thought that if he could invent a method to kill these pathogenic microorganisms, he should be able to prevent these diseases. After that, he published articles on Pasteur's microorganism theory in magazines.</p>
<p>However, Lister wanted to use chemical methods to kill germs, which was different from Pasteur's method of sterilization by heating. When Lister continued his research in Glasgow Hospital, many patients died from diseases such as sepsis, pyemia, erysipelas, tetanus, and gangrene. The number of deaths from amputations was also more than 45 percent. In 1865, Lemaire of Carlisle happened to use carbolic acid for disinfection of sewers. When Lister heard this news, he also applied carbolic acid to surgery. After two years of experience, he published the results. The operations he performed using the carbolic acid disinfection method included abscesses of the spinal cord and joints, amputation of the knee joint, surgery on the chest, and fractures of the patella.</p>
<p>At that time, the medical community was unwilling to believe in the effectiveness of the antiseptic method advocated by Lister, and there were even quite a few people who directly opposed it. Von Liebig and Helmholtz, who opposed Pasteur's theory the most, said: Microorganisms only exist together by chance, and are not the cause of fermentation and corruption, and the suppuration of wounds is not caused by bacteria, but by the action of enzymes, partly from the body and partly from the bandage material. Their attitude towards Pasteur's theory was still like this, so of course they did not believe in Lister's antiseptic treatment, which was closely related to Pasteur's theory. Even Lister's friend Simpson of Edinburgh also stood in opposition. Spence also said that in addition to the strong stimulation of carbolic acid to wounds, the course of wounds was no different from the traditional treatment methods. In this way, until 1872, there were only a few places in England, such as Liverpool and Manchester, that adopted Lister's antiseptic method in surgery. As for London, they simply did not know that there was such a thing. From this, it is conceivable that the attitude of the medical community towards Lister's antiseptic method was cold at that time.</p>
<p>In order to dispel misunderstandings, Lister often published his theories and experiments in magazines and public meetings. Later, in order to completely prevent the infection of wounds, he became more determined to study, and as a result, he published the carbolic acid atomizer and the antiseptic bandage using carbolic acid in 1871. At that time, Lister's thinking was based on Pasteur's experiments; he thought that the air contained germs, so he took these germs in the air as the object of the battle. From today's point of view, the main purpose of antiseptic sterilization is to kill the germs attached to the fingers of the surgeon, surgical instruments, and the skin surface near the wound, rather than to kill the germs contained in the air; but at that time, Lister's fundamental idea was that as long as the germs entering the wound from the outside can be killed, suppuration and infection can be prevented. This policy is still unchanged even in modern times!</p>
<p>When Germany fought the Franco-Prussian War from 1870 to 1871, the army had adopted antiseptic treatment. In 1872, Schultze, a German military doctor stationed in Edinburgh, published many articles on Lister's antiseptic method in the German Military Medicine Journal; as a result, everyone paid attention to Lister's wound treatment method. Later, many doctors added detailed experiments and confirmed that it was effective. When Koch discovered pyogenic bacteria and knew the nature of this bacterium in 1877-1878, Lister's antiseptic method was transformed into today's aseptic method. Later, in 1886, steam sterilization replaced the disinfection of corrosive sublimate, and in 1891, the aseptic method was actually applied.</p>
<p>(3) The Invention of the Microscope</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 17th century, the invention of the microscope made it possible to know the world that could not be seen with the naked eye like the back of one's hand, which can be said to be a new era in academics. This is as important as the invention of the telescope promoting the progress of astronomy.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Using Traditional Chinese Medicine in a Western Way (Continued) <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>

<p>(10) Camphor</p>
<p>Origin</p>
<p>This product is a dextrorotatory ketone obtained from the camphor tree (CiunamomrmCamphora (LInne) NeesetEbermaier) of the Lauraceae family. The tree is an evergreen tree, more than ten feet tall. There are many yields in the eastern part of Fujian and Zhejiang. It takes decades for it to become shade. Unfortunately, in recent years, Chinese people do not know how to cherish it. It is often deeply mined and felled by the Japanese, and they do not know how to add plants. The trees have been reduced a lot.</p>
<p>Properties</p>
<p>This product is a colorless, translucent or white crystalline flexible block, or a white crystalline powder. It has a peculiar odor, with permiating qualities, a slightly bitter taste, initially pungent and hot, and then cool. One part of this product needs 800 parts of water to dissolve, but it is easily soluble in alcohol and ether.</p>
<p>Experiment</p>
<p>Add 1 gram of this product to 10 cc of petroleum benzine or 10 cc of alcohol, it should dissolve clearly and transparently. If there are insoluble substances, it means that it is mixed with paraffin and stearic acid. Also, take a copper wire and curl it into a spiral, place it in a colorless flame to burn. After the flame does not appear green, dip a small amount of this product, burn it in the outer flame first, and then move it to the lower edge of the colorless flame. The flame must not be dyed green. If it turns green, it is artificial camphor. Also, this product is mixed with aqueous formaldehyde, carbolic acid, menthol, thymol, pyroxylin, resorcinol, salol, etc., then it will liquefy. This should be noted in the preparation.</p>
<p>Effect</p>
<p>This product has a local irritant effect and weak antiseptic power. When absorbed, it excites the central nervous system, causing blood pressure to rise, breathing to increase, or sweating. In large quantities, it causes delirium, hallucinations, such as symptoms of epilepsy. Internal use is aimed at strengthening the heart and excitation, such as application to fever, typhoid fever, pneumonia, and drug poisoning. If it is used for emergency treatment of collapse, and treatment of chronic bronchitis and night sweats, etc., then use the injectable preparation of this product. Its external use is applied to neuralgia, rheumatism, frostbite, ulcers, etc., by applying it to the affected area, and it is also used as a repellent for insects.</p>
<p>(Appendix Old Saying) Pungent and hot, unblocks the sensory orifices, benefits stagnant qi, removes cholera, epigastric pain, cold damp beriberi, kills insects. Those with weak qi should use it more, then the body will be cold, the qi will be exhausted, and they will die.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Clearing the Name of the Peach Blossom <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>Spring is the season for brewing poetry; wine is the hook for fishing poetry; in this magnificent spring light, drinking wine while facing the flowers, every Chinese poet who understands prosody will be humming with enthusiasm, as if mosquitoes are rising from the tongue and flies are circling around the mouth.</p>
<p>However, the general poetic friends' singing of peach blossoms cannot get rid of the two traditional ideas of past poets: one is to lament its fate, such as the feeling of "peach blossoms are destined to be washed away by the flowing water," which comes with a stroke of the pen; the other is to ridicule its character, such as the feeling of "frivolous peach blossoms follow the flowing water," which also comes with a stroke of the pen. There is also the Xixi Conghua (trivial notes of Xixi) that caters to elegance, comparing peach blossoms to demons; and the blind fortune teller who details the eight characters, saying that if someone encounters peach blossom luck, they will inevitably have the danger of various sexual mania.</p>
<p>Flowering and falling is a certain process in the flower bushes; if you treat the falling petals in the wind and rain as a symbol of the peach blossom's poor fate, then plum blossoms, apricot blossoms, and the like are all destined to be poor. Why only say that the peach blossom is destined to be poor? Without the falling petals, how can the fruits be abundant; look back later, when the summer and autumn come, what kind of peaches, jade peaches, and honey peaches will arouse social love and be reluctant to let go; may I ask if plum blossoms and apricot blossoms can produce such sweet crystalline products and fat, moist kernels? The fate of the peach blossom surpasses that of the plum blossom and apricot blossom; it is not destined to be poor, then drifting with the water is not a symbol of its frivolity. The Xixi Conghua takes the peach blossom as a demon, which is especially nonsense, and it is true that the one who calls it a demon will be called a demon. The peach blossom luck in the mouth of the blind fortune teller is something that people are unwilling to accept; in fact, it is not necessarily impossible to have peach blossom luck, leaving good seeds among people, what's wrong with that?</p>
<p>The peach blossoms bloomed too late this year. This "Clearing the Name of the Peach Blossom" is a miscellany that I wrote when I could not see the peach blossoms during the Qingming Festival,</p>

<p>The most righteous people in the world are those who never stop lecturing when they see sensual behavior on the screen. The most useless people in the world are those who endure like earthworms, yet sacrifice their lives in resistance without considering their capabilities. The most despicable in the world are coolies, the most cheerful are poets, the sweetest hearts are those of young girls, and the most easily manipulated hearts are also those of young girls.</p>
<p>The four monsters of the world are: beggars, bandits, the unemployed, and governments.</p>
<p>The hardest things in the world are: the heads of enslaved people, the shoulders of farmers, and the mouths of diplomats from independent nations.</p>
<p>The most bloodstained things in the world are: the medals of great generals, the tombstones of nameless heroes, and the wages of child laborers.</p>
<p>The easiest things to do in the world are for warlords to display their skills, for husbands to expose their bestiality, and for the comfortable to release their sexual desires.</p>
<p>The joy of a mother's love and the gentleness of the sea are alike; the iron chains of hell and the shackles of a laborer's family are alike.</p>
<p>The most laughable and precious things in the world are like the curves of a dancer, the throat of a singer, the new clothes of a flower girl, the face of a female office worker, the tears of a big landlord, the opium pipe of a certain country's people, and the unresisting coolies.</p>
<p>Well, there is no end to the things of the world. I am already intoxicated by the sounds, colors, smells, and tastes of these things.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Rouge Fire <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Ming</p>
<p>Like peach blossoms blooming in the morning mist, sunset glow soaking in the clear waves, rubies floating in mercury, coral powder ground in cheese: roses are laughing, roses are dancing, pomegranates are singing, ah, such bright and charming rouge! By association, seeing the words "rouge," one instinctively turns to the image of women. Therefore, in literature, using "rouge" as a substitute for women is also very common.</p>
<p>Ladies in the city, sixteen years old and above, all know how to choose and buy it. Regarding Coty and Three Flowers, as well as domestic "Red and Blue," they can distinguish good from bad at a glance. Just like going to the cosmetics counter in a department store to point out Simon's face powder and 4711 perfume, they are equally astute. It is a pity that Chinese ladies are too fond of foreign products and rarely use domestically made madder and sappanwood juice. Reading "Makeup Table Records," I learned that the Tang Dynasty was very particular about rouge. It had very gorgeous titles: called Pomegranate Charm, Very Red Spring, Little Red Spring, Tender Wu Fragrance, Half-Passing Charm, Ten Thousand Gold Red, Sandalwood Heart, Dewdrop, Inner Circle, Heavenly Palace Skill, Luo'er Yin, Light Red Heart, Orangutan Halo, Little Vermilion Dragon, Grid Double, Tang Charming Flower, and Slave Servant. Some were applied to the cherry lips, like holding cherries, similar to the current "lipstick"; some powdered the face first, then applied it to the cheeks, thick ones were called "wine brush branches," lush and thick ones were called "peach blossom makeup." This rendering method is not much different from today.</p>
<p>I remember that in "The Story of the Stone," the prodigal Jia Baoyu saw the little maid Mandarin Duck lying across the bed, and it was very beautiful. Baoyu then went back to have it dressed on our granddaughter, which could save himself from doing the right thing. At this time, he passed a stall selling baked cakes. It was because he had not eaten anything since waking up in the morning, and he felt a sense of emptiness in his stomach, but he was reluctant to buy them to fill his stomach, so he had to comfort himself... It was almost time for lunch.</p>

<p>Jumping onto the tram: finding a seat is naturally the first priority, and the sole target for finding a seat is that out of ten people, eleven will pay attention to the four corners. If he gets there first and gets his wish, his face will show a smug expression. At the same time, his head, back, hips, and everything else rely on a comfortable position. Otherwise, how disappointed he would be, and how envious of those who got there first! I remember it was Mr. Zhang Ruogu who said: occupying the four corners of the tram symbolizes the Chinese warlords seizing and occupying territory. I say no, occupying territory is one thing, occupying the corner of a tram is another. You have to know that occupying the corner of a tram is entirely an expression of disposition, for example: if the national capital moved to Luoyang, or the X people ran to X, it really has nothing to do with occupying the corner of a tram!</p>
<p>A not-so-modern young lady entered the tram. At this time, the passengers were very crowded. The lady happened to be swaying with an eighteenth-century-style old woman.</p>

<p>Guizhi said: "Is it always eighty or a hundred a month?" Jiang said: "If a person has this much money, it is enough to support a family." Guizhi still did not speak. Jiang said: "The old man said last time that he wanted to find a family for Company Commander Zhao. It's just that it's not easy to choose the right person. Actually..." She hesitated for a while at this point, and then continued: "A company commander who is not very old, has a good temper, and has no one at home, what other person would not want such a marriage?" Guizhi hugged the clothes in her arms,揉made them into a cloth ball, stepped down to the ground, poured a cup of hot tea with the hot water on the stove, looked at the things on the table, touched them, for about five or six minutes, and then returned to the kang to work. Jiang saw that the girl seemed unwilling to listen to such words, so she did not dare to decide whether she was unwilling to listen to such words. After a while, she slowly smiled and said: "Company Commander Zhao is a good person in every way. What do you think?" Jiang was not sure about the girl's attitude towards Zhao Ziqiang, so she simply asked the girl directly. Guizhi felt that, judging from Zhao Ziqiang's character, she really could not say anything bad about him. Her mother had eaten the person's cooked beef, and she had to compliment him a few times, so she really had nothing to say. So she replied faintly: "He's not bad." Jiang thought that the girl naturally did not want to directly say that he was good. The four words "not bad" described the girl's attitude of wanting to say good but being too embarrassed to say good. After a pause, she smiled and said: "I mean, I want to be a matchmaker for him." Guizhi, seeing her mother's attitude and hearing her words tonight, knew that there was definitely something going on. She thought to herself that ignoring her mother would be fine. Now that her mother had directly said that she wanted to be a matchmaker, this made it difficult for her to deal with. Should she deny it? Her mother was talking about being a matchmaker, not about arranging a marriage. If she expressed her unwillingness, it would seem that she was overthinking things. Should she not deny it? On the other hand, it would be considered an admission, and that would not do. It was difficult to express her attitude, and she had to express it, which was very painful. Because of the pain, she pondered for a long time and could not speak. (37)</p>
<p>Putting his face close to her cheeks, smelling the fragrance, and leaning against her body, he smiled obsequiously and said: "Good sister, give me the rouge on your lips to eat." While sticking to her like taffy. How fragrant and amorous, but also how cheesy! In fact, what's so objectionable about it compared to the public kissing scenes on the screen now?</p>

<p>The sky had just turned white, and the roosters had not yet sung the short song to urge people to get up. The vegetable vendor was already wearing the waning moon, stepping on the dewy fields, diligently digging up green vegetables and putting them into the carrying poles.</p>
<p>Although his head was covered with white hair and his forehead was deeply etched with wrinkles, he did not show any signs of aging and was still full of youthful vitality. After working for a while, he felt a little feverish, so he took off his jacket. At that time, the corners of his forehead, which were moistened with sweat, were already shining.</p>
<p>Shouldering the full load of vegetables, he hurried to the market with his blue-veined feet. He thought to himself: there is not much rice left in the rice jar; yesterday, the neighbor next door sent a basket of green plums, so he had to send some gifts in return; the weather is getting hot, and Ah Gou needs to add one or two pieces of coarse cloth clothing... Then he thought of Mrs. Huang, who often bought his vegetables, who was also very kind. When he saw her today, he would ask her for a few pairs of broken shoes. In front of them, a young man in a suit holding a bunch of Western newspapers saw him and hurriedly stood up, vacating his original seat. At the same time, he stretched out his free hand, raised his palm to the lady, and touched the lady's clothes with his fingers. He casually shifted his gaze and glanced at the old woman who had mistakenly taken a step forward. The lady had just sat down halfway on her buttocks when she seemed to notice something. She immediately stood up again, supported the old woman to sit properly with both hands, then stretched out her jade arm, pulled the rattan ring, and stood with her back to the young man in the crowd... This is a scene I saw on the Number 3 tram twenty minutes before writing this article.</p>
<p>Women's Paradise</p>
<h3 id="e213">Suzhou Women <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Ju Yun</p>
<p>When the words "Wu Girl" are mentioned, all Chinese people recognize Suzhou as the birthplace of beauties. It seems that melancholy and ill health, holding one's heart like Xi Shi, is a common affliction of Suzhou women. Moreover, people in the northern provinces even think that all southern girls who become prostitutes are Suzhou people. No wonder when the Feng Army went south in 1925 and stationed in Suzhou, they called every woman wearing a cheongsam on the street a "flower girl."</p>
<p>In fact, this concept is completely wrong, because in a degenerate society, there is hardly a port without prostitutes, but it is even more absurd to think that all southern prostitutes are Suzhou people. It is often the case that pleasure-seekers mistakenly believe that all prostitutes are Suzhou people, and the prostitutes themselves also pretend to be Suzhou people. Once, a Ningbo prostitute was asked where she was from. She said: "I am a Suzhou person." There are many, many jokes like this, but they still cannot reduce people's slanderous psychology towards Suzhou women!</p>
<p>I believe that Suzhou women are indeed pioneers in meeting the needs of modern women. In almost all inland counties, there are still many girls with bound feet, especially in those "remote areas." It seems that such strange phenomena can no longer be found in Suzhou. Women in the rural areas of Suzhou absolutely do not bind their feet. This custom did not start now. Throughout the era when women across the country were practicing foot-binding, rural women in Suzhou always went barefoot.</p>
<p>Hoeing the fields and gathering firewood in the mountains, women work as hard as men. Or, if we have visited Dengwei Tianping Mountain, we have seen many rural women carrying mountain sedan chairs, walking briskly and full of energy. Suzhou women are not showing weakness! In the city, except for a part of the daughters of wealthy families who live in secluded mansions, Suzhou women are not as shy and timid as others. Naturally, in the eyes of nineteenth-century people, it is considered frivolous for women to walk in the streets.</p>
<p>Let's look at the streets and alleys of Suzhou again. No matter what kind of shop – grocery store, dim sum shop – there are one or two women sitting behind the counter. Some are the daughters of the shopkeepers, and most of the others are respectfully called "Old Mother." Naturally, the lives of these women cannot be said to be thoroughly vocational for women, but they can probably be regarded as the prelude to vocational work for women.</p>
<p>Most Suzhou women, especially the daughters of ordinary families, are able to work hard and fulfill their duties as women. Then, Suzhou women are not considered backward in this era.</p>

<p>When furnishing a room, it is not advisable to have too much furniture, nor is it necessary to demand that it be luxurious. The most important thing is simplicity and cleanliness. If the furniture is properly matched, you will feel comfortable and at ease living in the room.</p>
<p>The smaller the room, the easier it is to furnish. Almost everyone living in the metropolis of Shanghai has few houses and many tenants. Whether it is a parlor, a multi-story building, or a small room, it can be furnished beautifully and completely.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of two small and comfortable single bedrooms, arranged according to the position of a multi-story building. Perhaps it can provide a reference for general female students and professional women who pay attention to interior decoration.</p>

<h3 id="e215">The Future of Capitalism by Xie Juzeng <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Why has capitalism, which was painstakingly built over the past few centuries, completely collapsed today? Where exactly has our production and sales system broken down? Can the past glory be restored? And if so, what methods can be used to restore it?</p>
<p>The world's business leaders stand before these fundamental questions, utterly at a loss. They repeatedly put forward excuses like "the gold standard," "tariff barriers," "reparations," "price stabilization," or other similar pretexts to mask their lack of consensus. They wring their helpless hands, seeking assistance from governments; meanwhile, world commerce is in chaos, causing the majority of people to suffer from hunger and cold, while the lives of the rest are constantly entangled in an unstable and insecure environment.</p>
<p>So, what are the governments of various countries doing in this era of unprecedented economic hardship? Politicians, like a continuous stream, are busy with meetings, seeking not the happiness of all mankind, but the interests of the part of the people they represent. Look at the British government, which has abandoned its long-admired free trade policy and begun to build tariff barriers. Yet, it still cannot avoid the burden of depression. In the United States, long trenches are being dug behind tariff barriers, ultimately forcing the President to use force to expel starving veterans, clear them from the capital, and finally compel the new President to implement emergency financial measures, declare a bank holiday, and barely weather the storm of the banking crisis; and the reefs ahead are numerous. Look at Japan, on the one hand aggressively invading our country, on the other hand countless children are starving to death because they have nothing to eat, and those who are made slaves and prostitutes are living worse than death.</p>
<p>Everywhere, kings are replaced by presidents, presidents by dictators; one regime follows another, but it's the same old soup with different ingredients, and in the end, the people still starve.</p>
<p>When future historians describe this particularly inept period of human history, to which people will they attribute all the evils caused by this chaotic state? This is truly an interesting question. Politicians? Business leaders? In any case, it will not be easy to write about the actions of the business leaders of this period. They allowed the great carriage of capitalism to race down the mountain along a precipitous cliff. The drivers—the masses—lacked the strength of unity to control the reins and guide the carriage safely forward, instead allowing their passengers—the politicians—to pull the ropes in their own directions, going south and north, each pursuing their own agenda. How could they expect the carriage not to overturn at the foot of the mountain! So, the leaders of some parts of the whole commerce tried to correct the unsteady passenger car with their bodies, and then put a stone under a wheel. But the momentum was too great, and finally, it crashed head-on, causing a major disaster.</p>
<p>Are we being critical of the leaders of the world's business community? Let us raise another question to answer carefully. Suppose one of the business units under their control experiences disorder, what would they do? The answer is very simple: they would begin to reorganize that unit, acting swiftly and powerfully to ensure that the unit immediately harmonizes with everything else, never allowing it to remain disordered for long, nor allowing the leader of that unit to cling to their position permanently. But if all the business units under their control are caught in a vortex of disorder, what exactly would they do? If they are unwilling to change those leaders, it is doubtful whether they will be able to overcome all difficulties and bravely reorganize the entire enterprise, so that work can return to its original smoothness and harmony. If this happened to only one unit, or a business controlled by any individual business leader in today's world, or a few units, it would certainly not be a problem. There are plenty of cases that have proven to be handled successfully. But once this chaotic and turbulent situation spreads to the entire world's business community, it becomes impossible to remedy through individual efforts. So, what are our leaders doing? Just look at the world's unemployment statistics, and that is the answer to this question. Yet, we are still under our capitalism, and we still cannot escape the control of the world's business leaders. They control the entire prosperity of the world:</p>
<p>All capitalist enterprises—except Russia—each control the world's raw materials. They control the factories, turning these raw materials into useful goods. At the same time, the world's transportation industry, with only a few insignificant exceptions, is organized along capitalist lines, extending to the world's financial organizations and banking systems, all of which are the same. They not only control everything, but also control the treatment of labor. In short, everything necessary for a prosperous world is in their hands. That being the case, in today's pessimistic and chaotic situation, wouldn't it be unfair to curse them? In fact, no. Precisely because everything is in their hands, they should work even harder than ever before they can handle this world's turmoil! It is their duty to understand the root cause of this difficulty and to have the full courage and boldness to solve this problem.</p>
<p>To give a few simple examples, in the eighty or ninety years before the European War, England could be said to have supplied manufactured goods to the whole world in exchange for raw materials, and from this trade, England and its industries built a prosperous foundation. During this period, the exchange of goods between England and other countries was very simple, but as the export of British machinery increased, other countries began to learn from them by stealth, and thus the state of world trade gradually became complex. Other nations, hiding behind tariff barriers, began to turn their raw materials into manufactured goods, initially only for consumption by their own people, but later, as production increased, they sold them to any country they could export to and profit from.</p>
<p>In the United States, this was particularly evident. It desperately produced various manufactured goods, and thus the new industrial leaders who were created began to seek markets. But after searching and searching, they could not find a market that had not been occupied by merchants from other countries, so the only way out was to resort to cheap goods, and thus fierce competition began between nations, which sowed the seeds of great chaos. Almost every country has become industrialized. New factories in all major countries around the world have begun to produce goods. This has become the main goal of governments, so they have begun to plan accordingly. Goods manufactured within their own country can be exported abroad and sold to various countries as much as possible; at the same time, goods from other countries are not allowed to be sold within their own country. Based on this policy, governments have erected or torn down tariff barriers, either raising them high or lowering them, with the result that the blood and sweat of the rest of the world's people are used as the price for the prosperity of a part of the people. Later, this chaotic situation became more and more obvious day by day, and the European War broke out. The world then immediately turned to the simple trade methods of the first fifty years of the eighty or ninety years before the Great War. England and most of the European countries competed to convert factories into the production of military supplies. International trade competition ceased. And the countries that were not involved in the war took the opportunity to sell almost everything that their factories could produce. As for the products of the factories of the warring countries, they were all consumed in large-scale destruction.</p>
<p>Finally, the Great War ended, and those countries that were not affected by the war were busy in the following years supplying goods to repair the ruins. At the same time, the warring countries also began to reorganize their factories and began to manufacture ordinary goods of peacetime. Thus, they gradually restored the same position of world trade as before the Great War, only to be compounded by the difficulties of complex international debts and the very complex financial problems of the world, but this was only one of the terrible legacies that the war left to mankind.</p>
<p>Anyone who has traveled around the world will understand that the goods produced by the world's factories have not exceeded the amount of human consumption. For example, in China, most of the 450 million people are extremely poor, and many goods, not to mention consumption, have not even been seen. And most of the people in India have nothing but a piece of cloth on their heads and a few grains of rice in their bowls. Even in Europe and the Americas, millions of people do not have what it takes to reach the ordinary standards of Western civilization, so that everyone feels the need to consider reducing comfort. So it is very clear that the world's factory production is far from enough to meet the needs of human comfort and happiness. In other words, today's production is still far below the limit of world population consumption. It is true that warehouses all over the world are filled with goods, and many farmers are unwilling to sell at a loss, and often destroy their harvests. But these situations are not so much an indication of overproduction, but rather the result of the collapse of capitalism's distribution system. From this, it can be seen that after capitalism built its system, it was not qualified enough to retain the various benefits that had been adapted. And the procedure that should be taken in this second step is obviously to organize the whole world in a comprehensive way.</p>
<p>Many articles have discussed this issue, and many reorganization plans have been proposed from time to time. But very few have been put into practice. I do not believe that mankind will sit idly by and watch civilization be destroyed, and refuse to do their best to preserve it. We only look at Russia to see what methods can be applied to the great experiment. As for whether this experiment is successful or not, that is not our goal; our goal is that the front line of capitalism still has two paths: one is to reorganize its sources and lead the world back to the road of prosperity; the other is to use several new great experiments to change the production and distribution of human needs. Whether people truly welcome trying new experiments in the whole world is still a question; but it is welcomed by most people that the leaders of capitalist enterprises work hard on reorganization on a better and better basis. In practice, such a reorganization is not impossible. The first step is that every industry in every industrial country must have an organization, so that every industry in every country has its management agency. Divide the smaller and less important industries into several departments and place them under the same management. At the same time, put the banking finance and the organized labor in different departments and manage them separately and in the same way.</p>
<p>From among the leaders of these management agencies, representatives may be selected to form a supreme council. With this council and representatives, the country's trade can be integrated, and in cooperation with the government, a way can be found to end this chaotic situation of divergent government orders, and at the same time change the tariff policy, because this policy has destroyed so much of the world's commerce over and over again!</p>
<p>In some countries, the current laws may prohibit the industrial organization of the above-mentioned methods. But laws can be changed, and the power of capitalism, combined with the cooperative efforts of organized labor, can easily change any law on the statute books.</p>
<p>Once the industries of various countries are organized in accordance with the above-mentioned methods, a "World Industrial Alliance" can be created. This is not comparable to the current League of Nations, which has no administrative power. It can truly control world trade. It has the power to curb war, not just to persuade, but also to prevent the world's products from being used for this crazy purpose.</p>
<p>The world's working hours can be determined by the "World Industrial Alliance," and then the stability of world prices can be sought. In this way, one of the biggest problems at the moment will disappear invisibly. If the world's industrial leaders work together through such an alliance, then its reorganization plan may be welcomed by the Chinese people, thereby increasing the purchasing power of the 450 million people and increasing the consumption of goods in the world, which will benefit both parties. This is clearly different from the imperialist policies of the powers; the imperialist policies are not welcomed by the Chinese government and people, but a "World Industrial Alliance" has no imperialist color, so it is naturally easier to achieve results. Compared with the intervention of foreign governments, which only expands disputes, it is naturally not the same.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned China is only an example, and there are currently many such problems in the world that need to be solved urgently. And what we want to discuss about capitalism today is whether to create a world control mechanism that is currently lacking to solve these problems, or to return its power to new organizations? Capitalist leaders should remember well that, for example, the Communist Party is organized according to a system that can control its actions all over the world. The more advanced mankind is and the more civilized the world is, capitalism can only continue to move forward like a great development if its leaders are prepared to organize the current situation that they have created in the world. With a body like the "World Industrial Alliance," financial and monetary leaders and organized labor leaders and representatives of the business community can be brought together to discuss together. And human civilization can progress to an unlimited realm, and at the same time, the suppression of war is faster and more powerful than politicians. If the working hours of the whole world are agreed upon, then human comfort and cultivation will naturally increase as a result. And many of the current diseases of world commerce can be cured by such an organization. If the leaders of capitalism continue to pursue selfish policies and refuse to broaden their horizons and think from afar, then the replacement of capitalism by communism may not be far away!</p>
<h3 id="e216">The Maris System Bank and its Actual Situation by Wang Yutong <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>In the past, the "Banking and Trust" weekly of the Shih Shih Hsin Pao published a special issue on Maris System Banks. I, in my article "The Relationship between the Maris System Bank and Civilian Finance," repeatedly stated that it is the most necessary financial system for the current civilian economy in our country. In today's capitalist society, financial institutions have always adhered to the principle of tangible collateral. The bank's loan business is generally based on the existence and certainty of collateral. The main types of collateral are various valuable securities and real estate commodities. In recent years, due to the depression in the economic world, the market prices of various securities and real estate have fallen, and it is easy to break through the price of collateral. Therefore, banks have to quickly seek to recover their claims or require additional collateral, which puts borrowers in a more difficult position. Therefore, the Maris system abandons the tangible collateral principle and is based on personal credit, completely targeting small industrial and commercial businesses and salary earners. This system was created by the American Asar Maris. To this day, it is named after him and is called the Maris System. In 1910, when Maris was the legal advisor to the bank, he repeatedly dealt with questions about small loans. Maris, on the one hand, also noted the prevalence of usury in the country, which caused the people great suffering. He then planned to study a new program to encourage thrift among the lower classes and to provide wage earners and small business owners with credit loans. In the end, the basic principles studied by Maris were: (1) Character and earning power are the appropriate basis for granting credit. (2) Based on the above principles, the loan amount can be determined by the borrower's earning power to determine a longer repayment period. (3) Such loans must be limited to use in profitable businesses. Therefore, the principle of this system is to combine character and earning power as the best guarantee.</p>
<p>As for the Maris System Bank's method of raising loan funds, it issues three types of securities as circulating funds, namely: (1) Type A securities 丨丨 are a simple stock-like security, sold to general investors who aim to profit. (2) Type B securities 丨丨 are interest-bearing (usually five percent) investment securities, similar to the bank's fixed deposits. This security can be paid in installments. (3) Type C securities 丨丨 are specifically used to promote to borrowers who borrow from the bank. It is also an investment security that is paid in installments (paid off in one year). However, there is no interest.</p>
<p>The borrowing method of the Maris System Bank: The borrower should first be recognized by the bank's loan committee, and the bank will then order him to subscribe to Type C securities. Then the borrower will mortgage it to the bank. At the same time, the borrower will issue a promissory note for one year to the bank. The amount is the same as the Type C securities purchased, so that the amount of securities can be paid off and the loan can be paid off at the same time. Ordinary Type C securities are paid in fifty installments, once a week, and paid off within one year. The date when the payment is cleared is the time when the loan is repaid.</p>
<p>The Maris system is most prevalent in the Far East, especially in Japan. There are such institutions in the cities of Tokyo, Osaka, and Kobe. The most famous ones are the Japan Commercial and Industrial Promotion Corporation, the Showa Maris Commercial and Industrial Corporation, and the Osaka Maris Commercial and Industrial Corporation. The Japanese Maris</p>
<p>The system of financial system still takes the principle of personal credit without collateral as the principle. The most important points of decision are all based on the borrower's credit, character, and past experience. When Japan planned to implement it at the beginning, it also intended to target salary earners and small and medium-sized industrial and commercial businesses. However, because Japan's situation is different from that of the United States, the general salary earners have not been able to make full use of it. Therefore, its development center has inevitably gradually become concentrated on small and medium-sized industrial and commercial businesses. Therefore, the names of its business institutions often include such things as commerce and industry. As for the operating entity of the Maris system, it has been recognized as a formal type of banking of the Maris type in the United States. However, in Japan, any financial institution that is not regulated by the Banking Law shall not be called a bank. Therefore, the Japanese Maris System financial institutions always become institutions that run in separate ways from ordinary banks. In other words, the bank sets up another operating institution outside its own organization to handle the financial business of the Maris system. It also sets up a control agency丨HoldingCompany to handle it. The former is the administrative agency, and the latter is the legislative agency.</p>
<p>The increase in capital and payment of shares of the Maris System financial institutions by Japanese banks is also limited by the provisions of commercial law. It cannot be handled directly by itself, and is all handled by another control agency that is set up. And it manages the fully paid-up shares. As for the operating institution, it specializes in the business of lending. That is, when a borrower purchases securities, the control agency will also handle it.</p>
<p>The circulating funds of the Maris System financial institutions in Japan still hold the payment funds of the stock to offset the use. If it is necessary and the payment is insufficient, it can be borrowed separately. But this is an exception. The types of stocks are generally the following three items.</p>
<p>(1) Ordinary stock is the stock of an ordinary limited company. It is recruited at the beginning of its establishment and is the same as ordinary stock. When the company has no surplus, it shall not pay dividends. (2) Remuneration stock is recruited from outside with the purpose of earning profits. The funds paid for this stock are the main part of the circulating funds of the Maris System financial institutions. According to the provisions of Japanese commercial law, dividends must be paid from the surplus. However, this stock, regardless of whether the company is profitable or not, pays a fixed amount (generally five percent per year) to each stock purchaser in the name of remuneration. This is similar to the bank's ordinary fixed deposits.</p>
<p>(3) Installment payment stock Any person who wants to request a loan must subscribe to this installment payment stock. The shares must be paid in installments.</p>
<p>As for loans, they are only limited to stock purchasers. The loan applicant should first subscribe to a certain number of shares and pay the shares in installments. Then the operating institution will lend the funds according to the applicant's performance in paying the shares in installments. However, the amount is at most twice the amount subscribed by the other party. No collateral is required when borrowing. However, two guarantors should be provided. After the borrower obtains the loan, he must continue to pay for the purchased shares until the full amount is paid. Then, it will be transferred and sold to the control agency, and the funds obtained from the sale will be used to pay off the debt.</p>
<h3 id="e217">How to Solve the Unemployment Problem in Our Country by Deng Youzhi <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>After the Industrial Revolution, the mechanical industry replaced the handicraft industry, leading to a surplus of labor. This trend became serious after the war, and is even more severe today, especially in Germany. Due to the lack of statistics in our country, the number of unemployed people cannot be accurately determined. However, considering the widespread poverty in the country, it can be inferred that the number must be alarming. Nevertheless, there is a significant difference between the causes of unemployment in European and American countries and in our country. In those countries, unemployment is due to the extreme development of industry and commerce, where machines are used for mass production to replace labor, drastically reducing the demand for workers and causing unemployment. In our country, unemployment is due to the underdevelopment of industry and commerce, resulting in minimal demand for labor. Now, let's discuss only the causes of unemployment and its solutions in our country. The unemployment problem in Europe and America will be omitted.</p>
<p>(A) Types of Unemployed People</p>
<p>Unemployed people can be roughly divided into the following five categories: (1) Those who rely on ancestral inheritance and do nothing, who can be considered as non-workers. (2) Those who are unsuitable for employment due to old age or disability. (3) Those who do not have a fixed occupation, cannot maintain a living, and are frequently unemployed. (4) Those who engage in temporary occupations and cannot find another job afterward. (5) Those who lack the skills for any suitable occupation and therefore cannot be hired.</p>
<p>(B) Causes of Unemployment</p>
<p>(1) Causes related to the unemployed themselves: (1) Fundamentally lazy and enjoy the fruits of others' labor. This category accounts for the largest number in our country. Often, those with a few thousand yuan in farmland or savings become lazy and refuse to work, living at home and spending their days without engaging in production, and often indulging in excessive consumption. These people are the most shameful among the unemployed, not even as good as a lowly messenger. However, in recent years, due to the general economic decline, the exploitation by officials, and the pressure from foreign economic forces, this type of person has gradually decreased. Furthermore, the public has gradually begun to view having no occupation as shameful, which is a good sign and should continue to decline. (2) Due to the laziness, poor character, bad habits, or extravagance of the workers, they are dismissed by their employers.</p>
<p>(2) Causes beyond the control of the unemployed: (1) The outbreak of war or disasters causes panic in the economy, leading to unemployment. (2) The invention of new machines increases unemployment due to the adoption of new technology. This is not common in our country because we have not yet reached a stage of industrial development. (3) The economic downturn from prosperity causes panic and unemployment. (4) Seasonal changes, such as plasterers being unable to work on rainy days, and tea makers becoming unemployed after the tea season. (5) Intense competition and oversupply of the same goods cause businesses to shut down. The closure of a factory or store generates thousands or tens of thousands of unemployed people. (6) The relocation of industries from one place to another. (7) Changes in trends, such as the shift from small caps to felt hats, or from one pattern to another. During the period when consumers' preferences change, countless unemployed people can be created. (8) The cheap labor of child and female workers allows them to replace male workers, thus aggravating the unemployment problem for men.</p>
<p>(C) Methods of Relief</p>
<p>Relief methods can be divided into two types: emergency relief and fundamental relief.</p>
<p>(1) Emergency Relief Methods: (1) Providing the unemployed with money or goods as relief, which has a charitable nature and can only be applied in emergencies and cannot be sustained permanently. If such material assistance is given, not only will the providers be unable to sustain it, but it will also foster laziness among those receiving aid. (2) Implementing emergency public works. This is an emergency measure taken by the government to provide jobs to the unemployed to alleviate their distress. This method is more beneficial than the previous one because it promotes the goal of self-reliance among the unemployed. Examples include building dams, repairing roads, and dredging rivers. Last year, when Wuhan was flooded, the government encouraged disaster victims to build dikes as a form of work-for-relief, which belongs to this category.</p>
<p>(2) Fundamental Relief Methods: (1) The government should crack down on those who rely on inheritance and do nothing. These people not only fail to contribute their abilities to society but also exploit the labor of others, like social parasites. The government should crack down on them, and public opinion should condemn them. (2) Prevent population concentration and try to prohibit people from moving to densely populated cities as much as possible. (3) Promote industrial education to integrate knowledge and skills, so that everyone has a specialized skill. (4) The government should establish employment agencies to enable employers and workers to find suitable matches through the agency's introduction, thus avoiding unnecessary labor and expenses. (5) Implement a mandatory labor unemployment insurance system. It would be best if the central or provincial government could act as the insurer themselves; otherwise, the state should at least subsidize insurance companies that do not operate for profit. (6) Expand and consolidate state-owned enterprises, using machines for large-scale operations, so that labor disputes, strikes, unemployment, and other issues can be eliminated invisibly. (7) Adjust state-owned enterprises. Due to seasonal changes, the demand for labor fluctuates. The government should determine the increase and decrease in demand and use state-owned enterprises to mediate. This ensures that the supply of labor is neither excessive nor insufficient. In other words, when the general industry needs a lot of labor, suspend some non-urgent state-owned enterprises. When the labor demand decreases, resume these non-urgent state-owned enterprises to absorb a large number of unemployed people.</p>
<p>The relief methods are as described above. Some may argue: If our country adopts large-scale machine production, won't it repeat the mistakes of European and American countries today? I say no. Machines themselves are not only innocent but also capable of promoting work efficiency. What matters is how they are used. European and American countries have extensively applied machines to private industries, leading to the dead end of imperialism today. If we can have a virtuous, strong government with unlimited determination and ambition to use machines under the principle of state ownership, not only can we elevate this aging nation to a state of industrial development, but the unemployment problem can also be resolved.</p>

<p>Tongqing Exchange Shop Deposits Reach One Million</p>
<p>Since the Tongqing Exchange Shop on Ningbo Road began operating various deposit accounts without introductions on the 6th of this month, many people from all walks of life have been bringing money to open accounts. As of yesterday (the 9th), the total amount of these deposit accounts has reached one million, and there is a rush to continue opening accounts. This shows the difficulty of working capital turnover in the market recently, and also indicates that the money shop industry's adherence to outdated practices is not in line with the current times.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Supplementary Measures for the Banking Industry <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association sent a letter yesterday stating that the association held an emergency meeting today to discuss supplementary five items regarding the currency reform problem: (1) The three-bank exchange institutions will continue to operate, but will only be allowed to exchange silver taels for silver dollars, extending the time; (2) If banks and money shops receive silver checks from foreign banks, the receiving bank or money shop must endorse them and sign the statement: "(This check is only allowed to be exchanged for silver dollars at the Central, China, and Communications Banks)" before entering it into the silver dollar account; (3) Foreign banks' silver tael promissory notes must be converted into silver dollars at the legal rate of 0.715 before they can be used; (4) Promissory notes due before April 15th can be paid at a rate of 0.715 silver dollars per tael. If the due date is after April 15th and there is no issue date, they should be registered with the association before April 15th, and silver dollars will be paid at a rate of 0.715 when due; (5) All foreign exchange transactions must be settled with silver dollars. Payments for items 2, 3, 4, and 5 above will be submitted by the two associations to the Ministry of Finance for referral to the judicial authorities for record.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Securities Market Fluctuated with the Situation Last Week <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Resulting in More Declines than Gains</p>
<p>Last week, from April 3rd to 8th, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange was open for trading for only three days due to the Arbor Day holiday from the 3rd to the 5th. During this time, due to the market closure, the opening prices fluctuated considerably. Thursday was the first day after the holiday. Due to the sudden tension in Qinhuangdao, the resurgence of chaos, and Chairman Chiang's expedition to suppress the Communists, public confidence suddenly weakened. The Northern Faction and a certain large investor sold heavily, and retail investors followed suit, causing the market price to fall by more than one yuan. Unexpectedly, on Friday, there was a sudden reversal. Rumors of the collapse of the Japanese cabinet and a possible slowdown in the military policy boosted morale, and the market price rebounded by more than one yuan. The price movements over the two days canceled each other out. On Saturday, there were more rumors, and public sentiment turned from hot to cold again. The market price fell by one yuan again due to the emergence of large investors such as No. 38. Therefore, the weekend price was several jiao to more than one yuan lower than the previous week. Among them, Demobilization Bonds fell the most, by one yuan and two jiao. The total trading volume was 23.9705 million yuan, including 30,500 yuan in spot transactions and 23.94 million yuan in futures transactions. Among them, unified salt tax bonds accounted for over 9.1 million, demobilization bonds accounted for 3.79 million, 1929 bonds accounted for 3.9 million, 28th and 28th customs bonds accounted for 4.99 million, and the Transportation bond also traded over 1.2 million. The rest traded for tens of thousands to one or two hundred thousand.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to fewer buyers and reactionary selling, but rebounded later due to short covering.

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of supply from rural shops of the 20s and 30s became slack, and the market was soft. Bag orders have not yet been placed. It is reported that the two parties are discussing, and it is possible to resolve the issue tomorrow. Therefore, Qingjiao and other Bo Rice varieties still have only sporadic sales channels. Because the shops' supply became slack, the market followed and prices for Su, Tong, and Nangang Qingjiao rice all fell slightly. Duyangjian Glutinous rice and fragrant rice prices are still stable, without any loss or gain. However, Yin Yuan tax rice is still selling briskly, and the market is still strong with slightly better prices.</p>

<p>Provincial Field Personnel are dispatched to various regions to persuade people to incubate improved varieties</p>
<p>Zhejiang's spring silkworms hatch earlier than those in Jiangsu, and those in Hangzhou and Shaoxing hatch more than ten days earlier than those in Huzhou. As the Qingming Festival approaches, spring silkworm farming has begun in Hangzhou and Shaoxing. Seed selection is currently underway, and the Provincial Agricultural Improvement Field is planning to send personnel to various regions to persuade farmers to cultivate improved varieties. However, it is difficult to change the local customs, and there is deep faith in local varieties such as Wangze (produced in Xinchang), Baimei (produced in Shengxian), Zhugui (produced in Zhuji), and the Yuhang variety produced in Yuhang. Many farmers still prefer to keep the methods in more remote areas, and in the Haining area, some still follow the old method of soaking local varieties in salt water for three days two days before Qingming Festival, and then transferring them to lime water for about twenty minutes before taking them out, placing them in a ventilated place to dry, and then incubating them. As a result, the sales of improved varieties produced by various manufacturing fields (commonly known as foreign varieties) are lower than last year.</p>

<h3 id="e225">No Major Battles on the Eastern Front Yesterday and Today <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Our Front Line is Located Around Wangjialing</p>
<p>Waiting for Reinforcements Before Launching Another Major Counterattack</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Eastern Front has been quiet for the past two days. Our front line is located around Wangjialing. The enemy is currently continuously reinforcing its various positions along the front line. The number of troops near Shimentou has increased to 4,000, all of whom are puppet troops. The enemy is expected to launch another major counterattack after the reinforcements are completed. The morale of our front-line officers and soldiers is extremely high. If the enemy attacks again, we are determined to fight them to the death. The enemy ships have left the pacified Qinhuangdao and are sailing on the waters of Beidaihe and Yuguan, patrolling. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy has mostly moved to Jiuliankou to reinforce Shimentou. The number of Japanese and puppet troops gathered at Shimentou is now over 5,000, mixed with many Mongolian and Korean elements. A portion of them is near Liujiang, confronting our troops in Shangxiapingshan and Xiayu. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday afternoon, three enemy aircraft dropped over a dozen incendiary bombs on the northern gate of Qian'an County, causing extensive damage to civilian houses. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to people from Qinhuangdao, during the battle of Haiyang, the Japanese ordered the puppet troops to act as the vanguard without providing artillery support, only giving them a small number of rifles. The puppet troops immediately collapsed upon hearing our artillery fire. When we searched the battlefield, we found that the enemy corpses were all puppet troops, with no Japanese. Everyone was disappointed and eagerly hoped to fight the Japanese directly. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Announcement: The enemy in the Wangjiagou and Liujiagou area near Jielingkou has been defeated and there are no enemy traces left. Inside Fengning City, there are 500-600 Japanese soldiers, over ten armored vehicles, and over ten artillery pieces. There are 500-600 Mongolian and Korean soldiers each. In Xiwangjiayingzi and Guojiayingzi, there are over 2,000 mounted bandits of the traitor Liu Guitang. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) To avoid casualties, in addition to driving the traitorous army to act as the vanguard and attack us, the enemy sends aircraft every day to bomb our positions and rear areas. Yesterday, a Japanese aircraft bombed Haiyang and then flew to Qinhuangdao for reconnaissance, dropping a bomb outside the city. We suffered no damage. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to information received today from the Chinese side, it appears that the Qinhuangdao area has been cleared. Because the "Manchu" army, after resisting the Chinese army, is now retreating to the rear. It is also heard that there was not much fighting on the front line yesterday. The claim that Haiyang was recaptured by the Chinese army has been confirmed. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway Becomes Increasingly Serious</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the 8th, the (puppet) Manchurian government ordered various agencies in Manzhouli to block eight sections of the Chinese Eastern Railway at Manzhouli Station. They used sleepers to build scaffolding and piled sand, without cutting off the railway tracks. Railway officials closely monitored the scene, creating considerable tension within Manzhouli Station. As a result, except for the international trains connecting Europe and Asia, all traffic was completely blocked. (9th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The (puppet) Manchurian government has blocked the connection between the Chinese Eastern Railway in Manzhouli and the Trans-Baikal Railway line. Russian officials of the Chinese Eastern Railway are temporarily silent. However, on the 9th, Deputy Director Ksenofontov stated to Director Li Shaogeng that the Russian side has impounded 3,800 freight cars on the Trans-Baikal Railway and will return them to the Chinese Eastern Railway administration via the Siberian Railway and the Ussuri Railway. The deputy director's words have deep implications, as the Russian side has no right to protest against the (puppet) Manchurian actions. Fearing that (puppet) Manchuria will implement a blockade of the eastern border railway, it expressed this subtle diplomatic statement in order to gauge (puppet) Manchuria's opinion.

<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen telegraphed to Beiping on the 9th stating that since the 21st of last month, after our repeated counterattacks, the enemy's infantry has not dared to move slightly. They rely only on aircraft bombing. When the bombing is ineffective, they proceed to bomb our rear areas with no equipment. Their actions are extremely despicable. The enemy's strength consists of the 45th Regiment of the Japanese 6th Division, attached with considerable cavalry, artillery, and special forces, as well as mixed Manchu and Korean troops. Several of our regiments are near a certain location, preparing to repel the enemy. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Peiping) Song Zheyuan telegraphed on the 9th, at Hai hour: This morning, four enemy planes, under the cover of a combined force of enemy infantry, cavalry, and artillery, launched a fierce attack on our Panjiakou. After three hours of intense fighting, they were repelled by us. At noon on the 9th, the enemy again used six planes, under the cover of a large force of infantry, to fiercely attack Sasui Bridge and Santunying.

Also, the ancient calligraphy and paintings in the Summer Palace held by Zhang Xueliang were personally discussed with others and are extremely reliable. Although the number of items is not known in detail, it is said to be quite large. For the sake of preserving national treasures, it is hoped that Zhang will immediately hand them over to the government for safekeeping. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>陳果夫報告如何興復農村</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a memorial week this morning, with over 500 attendees, including Ye Chucang, Chen Guofu, Ju Zheng, Chu Minyi, Huang Jichen, Zhang Ji, Hong Ludong, and staff. Because Li Shizeng went to Shanghai, Chen Guofu gave a report on "How to Revive the Rural Areas." The main points were that the prices of agricultural products are now roughly three to four times higher than they were decades ago, but the lives of farmers are still very difficult, and rural areas are increasingly heading towards bankruptcy. The reason is that the prices of other goods are extremely high, so the income of farmers is not enough to cover their costs and labor. People generally say that to help the rural areas, we should start by improving seeds and increasing production, etc. In fact, the prerequisites for revitalizing the rural areas are: (1) actively carrying out water conservancy projects, (2) setting minimum prices for agricultural products to maintain the cost of farmers, (3) organizing financial institutions suitable for the needs of farmers, and (4) encouraging and assisting farmers to engage in side businesses during agricultural off-seasons. Only in this way can we save the bankruptcy of rural areas. Other industries and commerce will also prosper accordingly, and then all major plans for national salvation will be effective. Otherwise, if the rural organization collapses, the country will perish without the invasion of foreign enemies. The speech ended at 9 o'clock, and the meeting adjourned. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week at 9 a.m. on the 10th, with over 400 attendees, including Yu Youren, Shao Yuanchong, Niu Yongjian, Li Yuanding, Lin Xiang, He Yaozu, Lü Chao, and National Government staff. Chairman Lin led the ceremony, and Shao Yuanchong gave a report. He first described his impressions of inspecting the front lines and the heroic fighting of the soldiers. He said that our army used their flesh and blood to resist the enemy's sophisticated equipment. Moreover, there were many mountains outside the passes, and our army built trenches in the rocks. If enemy planes bombed, the explosion of the rocks would cause extremely heavy losses. However, the morale was not weakened at all, and they were all willing to endure sacrifices in order to seek permanent survival for the nation. This spirit of sacrifice by the soldiers at the front can inspire the people of the whole country to share the same hatred for the enemy, and it will also make the international community know that our nation is not to be insulted. Its significance is extremely important. He further hoped that all military personnel in the country would be able to perform their duties and go to the front to kill the enemy, and save China through sacrifice and struggle.

The spring plowing season has arrived, and there is no fertilizer to apply. Chaoshan claims that the villages will be bankrupt immediately. The actions of the donors are no different from helping evil spirits to wreak havoc. Please provide vigorous assistance and quickly telegraph Commander Chen in Guangzhou and Commissioner Fang Pu of the Finance Department of a certain district, requesting them to order the donors to release the bean cake in order to alleviate the people's difficulties. The telegram cannot express the urgency enough. Shantou City North and South Port Goods Transportation and Sales Association, Miscellaneous Goods Association, Brokers Association, respectfully.

<p>Reuters, Paris, 9th - According to today's news, former French Prime Minister Herriot will go to Washington, his qualification being that of a free informant, so as not to subject France to any restrictions, but he will transmit what he hears to France, so that the French government can make decisions on various issues discussed at the White House, especially the war debt issue. Today, a message was received from Washington that President Roosevelt has not yet decided on his attitude toward France. This probably refers to the previous news that the United States will treat countries that have not paid the December war debt differently. France's appointment of Herriot as its representative is an inevitable move by French nationalists. Herriot has been an advocate of paying war debts, and this attitude has made him uneasy in his position, but since stepping down, he has always urged France to fulfill its obligations. This fact cannot be forgotten by nationalists.</p>

<p>Hualianshe, Tokyo, 10th - Finance Minister Takahashi's intention to resign has not been cancelled. Prime Minister Saito and other cabinet members, the military, and the upper house are making every effort to persuade him to stay, but the results have not yet obtained Takahashi's consent. A coup in May may be unavoidable. Various factions are now actively starting work to seize the next government.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 10th - The Seiyukai, hoping to gain power, is organizing a policy investigation committee based on the policy-first principle advocated by President Suzuki over the years. This morning, it first held an association of party executives and policy investigation committee staff, and then in the afternoon, it held the first general meeting of the policy investigation committee at the headquarters hall, declaring the fundamental principles for establishing policies and investigative items. In particular, it must move towards establishing a new policy after leaving the League of Nations and banning gold exports again. When investigating, it is natural to re-examine the past policies, but in view of the objective situation of international politics and economy, it will strongly advocate establishing and expanding the national economy as the top priority. The major issues and countermeasures currently advocated by the Seiyukai's policy investigation committee are roughly as follows: (1) "Diplomatic Policy" The fundamental policy of the Empire's diplomacy has now been established. This can be clearly understood from the Imperial Rescript issued the other day. It is appropriate to follow the Holy Will, promote Japanese justice, and study appropriate and effective countermeasures. (2) "Japan-Manchukuo Control and Liaison Issues" Regarding the development of Manchukuo and the utilization of its resources and the cultivation of purchasing power, the establishment of Japan-Manchukuo unity and control is the focus, and the coexistence of the mainland industry and Manchukuo industry is sought. Regarding tariffs and other issues, careful investigation and research are conducted. (3) "Industrial Policy" After the ban on gold exports again, the changes in domestic and foreign affairs should be considered. The five-year plan of the Seiyukai previously announced should be re-examined. In particular, regarding the relationship between currency policy and fiscal policy, it is necessary to focus on smooth currency circulation. Based on this view, the Bank of Japan's actions in the market must be specially studied. (4) "Fiscal Policy" Although it is based on seeing through the future of finance and establishing a fiscal plan, it is factually impossible to eliminate the deficit immediately. Therefore, it is necessary to first establish a fiscal policy and seek harmony between finance and national defense. Based on this view, the reorganization of administrative finance must be carefully studied, and the issue of tax increases should also be considered.</p>
<p>Jinnensha, Tokyo, 10th - The National Alliance took the issue of Minister of Justice Oyama's retention as the starting point of the coup. After a secret meeting of President Adachi and various executives, the party headquarters decided to overthrow the current cabinet with the unity of the party. Most cabinet members below the Prime Minister hoped to stabilize the political situation by retaining the Minister of Justice, and painstakingly planned a cabinet life-saving strategy. The National Alliance considered this action to be deceiving the people, so it decided to oppose the Seiyukai's policy of gaining power and the Minseito's policy of prolonging the life of the cabinet. It will do its best to impeach the cabinet, and will start a national tour from the 16th to publicize the current cabinet's failures in order to expand the party's influence.</p>

<p>當局頗爲憂慮</p>
<p>Jinnensha, Tokyo, 10th - Ideological crimes by both left and right wings in Japan are increasing, which is causing considerable concern to the authorities. The Diet has also resolved to implement ideological countermeasures. The government has recently held meetings of various provincial governments to discuss follow-up matters, and plans to establish a joint agency of the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Justice to prevent ideological crimes. Among the recent crimes, many communists are confused by dissatisfaction and deficiencies in education. There has never been a suitable institution to educate these criminals. If such an institution can be realized, it can make the children of ideological criminals repent and return to the right path, and can prevent crime. The authorities are now doing their best to plan for its realization.</p>

<p>Havas, Vienna, 9th - The abolition of the federal system in Germany and the implementation of a centralized system under the authority of the Prussian state have dealt a major blow to the ideal of German-Austrian union, which has been advocated since the signing of the peace treaty. This can be seen in Austrian public opinion. The "New Free Press" commented, "The historian Treitschke once said that the German Empire is a unified Prussian state, with a few vassal states arching around it. These words are true."

<p>Reuters, Rome, 9th - Attention here is focused on the discussions between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Deputy Prime Minister Papen. Papen arrived here this morning, and German Speaker of the House Goering will also arrive here tonight from Berlin. The talks between Germany and Italy are seen as extremely important. Papen will stay in Rome until April 18, and plans to pay his respects to the Emperor during this period. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will make Papen and Goering understand that while Italy supports Germany's demands for treaty revision, it cannot tolerate violence. Papen's trip to Rome was originally on a mission to contact the Church. He will present to the Pope Hitler's attitude towards Catholicism, and it is hoped that the people of the Vatican will be able to understand him.</p>

He also said, "Parties of ultra-patriotic nationalists damage true nationalism, just as parties of Marxists damage true socialism." Goering talked about the government's law to reform the internal organization of Germany, saying that this is only a superficial structure. The people of the whole country should now work together for the new Germany. Finally, Goering urged the trade union members to resolutely exclude Marxism.</p>

<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported that on the 26th of last month, a man with bullet wounds and suspicious behavior was seen in front of the Suita station in Jimita-cho, Mishima-gun, Osaka Prefecture. He was arrested by the Suita police station. As a result of the interrogation, he claimed to be a resident of Shibetsu Village, Shibetsu-gun, Nemuro, Hokkaido, named Takashi Takaishi. He claimed that he had gone to China at the age of four and was raised by a Chinese merchant who ran a cotton mill. After that, he entered a military academy and, after graduating, was appointed a lieutenant in the Chinese army. After the Manchurian Incident, he was recruited as a translator in the Japanese volunteer army until he returned to Japan in September of last year. The police station telegraphed his place of origin to inquire about the veracity of his claims. On the afternoon of the 5th, his right foot injury was deemed suspicious. After repeated investigations by various parties, it was learned that he was originally a deserter who had been ordered to be arrested by the Marugame Military Police Sub-Division. His name was Mitsugi Mitsujiro. In August of Showa 4, he was a private second class in the 7th Company of the 12th Infantry Regiment in Marugame. Later, because he did not want to be dispatched to Manchuria, he secretly deserted and went to Manchuria privately to serve as a member of the Japanese volunteer army. His previous claims were completely false. He was handed over to the Takatsuki branch of the Osaka Military Police at 6 o'clock on the 5th.</p>

<p>Reuters, Moscow, 9th - The Soviet authorities today delivered the charges to the British personnel accused of being employed by Vickers, a total of 77 pages, accusing 18 people of sabotaging the machinery of the electrical plant. Before receiving this document, all defendants agreed not to disclose the contents, because the Soviet authorities kept it strictly secret when drafting this document. Soviet prosecutor Vishinsky has submitted the case to the Supreme Court today and announced that the trial will begin at noon on April 12. The five British defendants who have been released on bail went to the British Embassy this morning to talk to Vickers' legal advisor, Duna. Duna will be an observer and will not participate in the defense. The Soviet authorities are now busy decorating the "October Hall" in the Trade Union Building, where the trial will be held. The hall was a gathering place for aristocratic clubs during the imperial era and is luxuriously decorated. It is now a workers' conference place.</p>

The so-called resident naval department is of the same nature as the naval port department, responsible for the defense of the coastline and rivers of Manchukuo, directly under the Japanese Emperor, commanding and managing the troops, and under the command of the Minister of the Navy, in charge of military administration. It will have a commander, chief of staff, adjutant, chief engineer, chief accountant, and other key members, as well as warrant officers, non-commissioned officers, and appointed civil officials. The appointments will be made on April 1. The designated commander is Major General Saburo Kobayashi, the current chief of staff of the special naval agency in Manchukuo. The chief of staff is Colonel Masakazu Ito.</p>

<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun said that Japan is paying close attention to the changes in the new world situation after its withdrawal from the League of Nations. The foreign policy of the Manchukuo government also needs to be changed in part. However, whether or not the League countries recognize Manchukuo and whether or not they recognize Japan's recognition of Manchukuo have almost indicated that they do not intend to cooperate with Japan and Manchukuo. Therefore, the Manchukuo government does not advocate open doors to countries that deliberately obstruct recognition. In order to prevent anyone from entering the country arbitrarily and attempting to make malicious propaganda in the future, passport inspection stations have been newly established in Shanhaiguan, Gubeikou, Manchuli, Poklaniyetsa, Hunchun, Andong, Dalian, and Wafangdian. Anyone without a passport verification certificate from the Manchukuo authorities will be prohibited from entering the country. This is the second step in a tough policy to retaliate against non-recognition.</p>

<p>Guangdong Province Pays Close Attention to Li's Return to Guangxi</p>
<p>Li's Trip Unlikely in the Near Future</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Li Jishen resigned and went south to recuperate in Hong Kong a long time ago. Some time ago, his subordinates returned to Guangdong to engage in activities, which aroused suspicion from the Guangdong authorities, leading to various rumors. Li immediately sent a letter to Chen Jitang, clarifying all the external rumors. After this matter subsided, Li remained depressed and feigned illness in Hong Kong. In Guangdong Province, those who supported Li lost power due to Li's situation over the past few months. Unexpectedly, recently, the military and political authorities in Guangxi Province suddenly expressed their intention to welcome Mr. Li back to Guangxi. It is said that the telegram from Guangxi inviting Li was jointly sent by Bai Chongxi, Deputy Commander of the Fourth Group Army, and Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, on the 24th of the previous month to Mr. Zhang Renmin, Chief of Staff of the Army, who forwarded it to Mr. Li's residence in Hong Kong. The original telegram read, "Mr. Zhang Renmin of Guangzhou, please forward this to Mr. Li Rengong, who has been in retirement for a long time. We deeply miss and admire you. Currently, internal and external troubles are pressing in, and the people's livelihood is becoming increasingly depleted. Guangxi must revive its rural economy, but construction cannot continue. Both time and economy are constrained. We, Xi and others, serve our homeland with heavy responsibilities and limited talents. We feel deeply inadequate to cope with this critical period. You have been deeply concerned about your homeland recently. We respectfully invite you to return to Yong to provide guidance. We are overjoyed and eager to see you. Please telegraph the date of your departure so that we can welcome you. Bai Chongxi and Huang Xuchu bow." It is noted that this telegram was not sent directly from Yong to Hong Kong but was telegraphed to Zhang Renmin in Guangzhou for forwarding, which seems to have a purpose. Guangxi had long intended to welcome Li, but they did not express it independently because they had not gained the sympathy of Guangdong. However, since Guangdong had rejected Li before, they would naturally pay special attention to Li's return to Guangxi. Therefore, this move has become an important issue in the Southwest. It is said that Mr. Li has not yet decided whether to return to Guangxi after receiving the telegram. Judging from the situation, it is feared that Mr. Li's return to Guangxi will not be easily realized in the near future. (April 2)</p>

<p>Like other countries, Japan conducts a national census every ten years, which the Japanese call the "National Census." The Japanese National Census mentioned here refers to the second Japanese National Census at the end of 1930. This is not a matter of history but a current event. In the United States, detailed reports are usually available after five years. Therefore, the National Census recently published by the Japanese Bureau of Statistics is still a general overview. However, we can also recognize the strength of our enemy to some extent. This is the only reason I want to introduce it.</p>
<p>(1) Total Population</p>
<p>As of October 1, 1930, the exact calculated population of Japan was 64,450,000. The increase rate is as follows:</p>
<p>Total Population Increase Compared to Previous Increase Rate</p>
<p>(Thousands)</p>
<p>1920 55,963 丨丨丨 丨丨</p>
<p>(Thousands)</p>
<p>1925 59,736 3,773 6.7</p>
<p>1930 64,450 4,713 7.9</p>
<p>The national average population density is 169 people per square kilometer. In reality, the population is never evenly distributed throughout the country and is often concentrated in several important areas. We will list the population density of various regions in Japan as follows:</p>
<p>Location Population Per Square Kilometer</p>
<p>Tokyo Prefecture 2,522 people</p>
<p>Osaka Prefecture 1,952 people</p>
<p>Kanagawa Prefecture 1,688 people</p>
<p>Fukuoka Prefecture 512 people</p>
<p>Kagawa Prefecture 394 people</p>
<p>Saitama Prefecture 384 people</p>
<p>Aichi Prefecture 505 people</p>
<p>The following prefectures have lower densities:</p>
<p>Hokkaido 32 people</p>
<p>Iwate Prefecture 64 people</p>
<p>Akita Prefecture 85 people</p>
<p>Aomori Prefecture 91 people</p>
<p>Miyazaki Prefecture 98 people</p>
<p>Japan's national population density of 169 people per square kilometer ranks second among the major powers, as follows:</p>
<p>Country Population Density</p>
<p>United Kingdom (Mainland) 196 people</p>
<p>Germany 133 people</p>
<p>France (Mainland) 76 people</p>
<p>United States 16 people</p>
<p>The concentration of population in cities is an inevitable phenomenon under capitalism. Now, let's compare the urban and rural population of Japan as follows:</p>
<p>Per Thousand People</p>
<p>Year Urban Population Rural Population</p>
<p>1920 180 people 820 people</p>
<p>1925 216 people 784 people</p>
<p>Male</p>
<p>Unmarried Married Widowed Divorced (Separated)</p>
<p>1920 55.3 39.8 3.8 1.2 48.1 40.3 10.1 1.5</p>
<p>1925 55.8 39.5 3.6 1.1 48.6 40.0 9.9 1.5</p>
<p>1930 56.9 38.9 3.4 0.8 49.2 39.8 10.0 1.0</p>
<p>The increase in unmarried people is also due to the economic downturn. The lower number of unmarried women compared to men is because women marry at a younger age. The higher number of widowed women compared to men is because it is acceptable for men to remarry, while it is considered immoral for women to remarry.</p>
<p>(3) Occupational Distribution</p>
<p>In the total population, the distribution of employed and unemployed is as follows: Employed (%) Unemployed (%)</p>
<p>Male 59.1 40.9</p>
<p>Female 31.9 68.1</p>
<p>Total 45.6 54.4</p>
<p>Based on the results of the case study, excluding the unemployed, the occupational distribution among the 29,220,000 employed people is approximately as follows per thousand people:</p>
<p>Occupation Population per Thousand People</p>
<p>Agriculture 484 people</p>
<p>Fishery 19</p>
<p>Mining 8</p>
<p>Manufacturing 181</p>
<p>Commerce 153</p>
<p>Transportation 38</p>
<p>Public Service and Freelance 70</p>
<p>Household Servants 28</p>
<p>Other 19</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In general, imperialists, when a country has a small population, propagate to the public that a small population poses a risk of being invaded by other countries and strive to promote childbirth. When the population is larger, they immediately say that we have an overpopulation and must develop outward to survive. These few words lightly reveal the imperialist's aggressive mentality. The so-called overpopulation and "lifeline" are nothing more than excuses for imperialist aggression. Japan's population density of 169 people per square kilometer is far different from Belgium's 266 people per square kilometer and the United Kingdom's 196 people per square kilometer. Moreover, Hokkaido has vast land and sparse population, which can be migrated. How can there be an overpopulation? The so-called lifeline and population problem are nothing more than theories fabricated by imperialist scholars.</p>

<p>Reports to the Southwest Political Affairs Council on the Recent Situation in Guizhou Province</p>
<p>And Discusses the Issue of Southwest Unity in the Future</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Wang Jialie returned to Guiyang and resumed his leadership of Guizhou's administration, his wife, Ms. Wan Shufen, was previously sent to Guangdong to discuss everything with the authorities of the Southwest Political Affairs Council. Later, the Southwest established a National Defense Committee, and Guizhou Province also sent Lu as Wang's representative to attend. Recently, there was news that You Guocai was planning to rely on the strength of Yunnan Province to return to Guizhou. Therefore, Wang Jialie specially sent Representative Zhang Yunliang to Guangxi and Guangdong to discuss all military and political liaison matters with the authorities of the two provinces. After meeting with Bai Chongxi in Guangxi, Mr. Zhang arrived in Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month. On the 3rd, he went to the Southwest Political Affairs Council to visit Li Zongren and various important military and political figures in Guangdong. He will travel from Guangdong to Hong Kong in the coming days to visit Hu Hanmin and discuss important official matters. According to Mr. Zhang, his mission this time is purely to report the recent military and political situation in Guizhou Province to the Southwest authorities and to discuss the issue of the Southwest's unity in the future. Since Wang Jialie took charge of the administration of Guizhou Province, he felt that most of the province's income was spent on military expenses. In order to engage in construction, he had to start with demobilization. It is reported that Guizhou Province has about twenty regiments. Since the political change, Chairman Wang decided to reduce the total number of troops in the province to ten regiments and allocate the saved military expenses to construction funds. The province's annual income is about 12 million yuan. In the past, annual military expenses reached 10 million, and there was no ability to develop construction. It is now planned to cut 10 regiments of troops, which cost about 5 million yuan in military salaries annually, leaving about 7 million yuan. 3 million yuan will be used for construction expenses, 3 million yuan for administrative expenses, and 1 million yuan for social welfare undertakings. If this plan can be implemented, the administration of Guizhou Province will be able to gradually prosper. Recently, various provinces in the Southwest are preparing to send troops to aid Rehe. Guizhou Province will also酌 (duó)編援熱軍 (zhuó biān yuán rè jūn - carefully plan and compile troops to aid Rehe) according to its capabilities. This move is being actively planned, but the military salary item is still under consideration. Chairman Wang previously planned to send me to Guangdong to serve as the director of the Guizhou 25th Army's office in Guangdong. Later, because I had other tasks, Chairman Wang sent Wang Jiezi to Guangdong to serve as the director of the Guizhou Army's office in Guangdong, so that he could contact the Guangdong military and political authorities at any time. As for the remnants of Mao You in Guizhou Province, they have now been resolved one after another. Currently, Che Yiming's troops in eastern Guizhou only have 1,000 guns and have been reorganized into a brigade, with Che still serving as the brigade commander. The remaining 300 to 400 people in You Guocai's troops in western Guizhou have all been incorporated. Jiang Bixu's troops in the north are also not a problem. All the troops in Guizhou Province are compiled into the 25th Army, with Wang Jialie serving as the army commander and Hou Tiejian serving as the deputy army commander, etc. It is also reported that the Southwest Political Affairs Council has sent Gan Jiayi to Guiyang today (the 5th) to discuss with Wang Jialie about coordinating Guizhou Province's dispatch of troops to aid Rehe. On the political side, Mr. Wang Shudu has been sent back to Guizhou to convey everything. (April 5)</p>

<p>Has Not Yet Decided Where to Settle After Arriving in Europe, Will Travel to Various Countries</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Luo Will Arrive in Shanghai This Afternoon From Beijing to See Him Off</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang, the former acting chairman of the Beiping Military Council and member of the North China Political Affairs Committee, telegraphed his resignation at the beginning of last month and came to Shanghai to recuperate. Due to accumulated overwork triggering old illnesses, he sought medical treatment and has gradually recovered. He bade farewell to old subordinates at his residence in Shanghai last night. He is scheduled to board the Conte Rosso tonight with his family and leave for Italy tomorrow morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e267">Bidding Farewell to Old Subordinates <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Zhang was seriously ill and declined to meet with guests. After receiving medical treatment, his old illness has been completely cured, and his spirits have gradually recovered. Last night, he received more than ten old subordinates, including Wang Shuhan, Zhang Zhenlu, Liu Mingjiu, Gao Jiyi, and Liu Zhe, to say goodbye. Because he has resigned from all military and political positions, he only spoke of old friendship and the sorrow of parting. Mr. Feng Yong also visited Mr. Zhang at 11:00 this morning, talked for a long time, and then took his leave.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Boarding the Ship Tonight <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang is scheduled to board the Conte Rosso tonight and leave Shanghai for Europe tomorrow morning. Also on board are Count and Countess Ciano, the Italian Minister to China. Accompanying him are Mrs. Zhang Yu Fengzhi, his daughters Lu Ying, sons Lu Xun, Lu Ri, and a young son who is still in infancy and has not been named. In addition, there are advisor Donald, secretary Shen Zutong, and more than ten attendants.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Haven't Decided on a Place to Live <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Reports say that Mr. Zhang will settle in Switzerland, where he has hired workers to build a house and will wander among the lakes and mountains. Reporters from the Xinsheng News Agency met at the Zhang residence and learned that Mr. and Mrs. Zhang have decided to go to Italy first and then travel to various countries. The itinerary after arriving in Italy will be decided in Europe. The only country for which a visa has been obtained is Italy. Although Mr. Zhang resigned and left the country, not asking about military or political affairs, as a citizen, he has a natural duty to both the country and the world. He will return to China soon to fulfill his duty.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Luo Arrives to See Him Off <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>According to a certain important person, Foreign Minister Luo Wen'gan has been in Shanghai for three days to see off Mr. Zhang and the Italian Minister. He is staying at the Cangzhou Hotel. However, after various investigations, it has not been confirmed that Mr. Luo has indeed arrived in Shanghai. However, according to reliable sources, Mr. Luo will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon, which means that it is a fact that Mr. Luo came to Shanghai to see off Mr. Zhang.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Pre-Departure Statement <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>In addition, Ning Wu, as Mr. Zhang's representative, answered the reporter's questions as follows: (Question) Does Deputy Commander Zhang have any statement before leaving the country? (Answer) Commander Zhang himself is now very willing to meet with you, but due to the doctor's instructions, he refuses to meet with guests and talk. However, Commander Zhang has repeatedly stated that the general situation of his departure from the country has been expressed in past telegrams. Therefore, he cannot comment on political issues for the time being because he is out of office. However, as a citizen, he will still devote himself to the party and the country after returning from his inspection. The inspection period is scheduled for six months. In addition to the military and political situation during his years of service, he will also pay attention to social undertakings. This trip will first go to Italy, and he plans to stay longer. Whether to go to Germany or the United States will be decided after arriving in Italy. (Question) Regarding the Beijing telegram about the antiques and calligraphy in the Summer Palace being taken away by Commander Zhang, has Mr. Zhang heard the details of this matter? (Answer) I have also seen this news, but I do not know the details. However, judging from what I have known about Commander Zhang's following over the years, this fact is not accurate. The calligraphy and paintings in the Summer Palace are under the jurisdiction of the Beijing Municipal Government. Even if Commander Zhang borrowed them for viewing, he would definitely return them. Commander Zhang did not have this kind of situation when he was in power in the past, and he will not have this kind of thing now that he is out of office. He obeyed the Central Government's orders in everything. This time, he obeyed the Central Government's orders and handed over hundreds of thousands of troops to the Central Government. From this, it can be seen that he is very clear between public and private matters. (Question) What about the sale of the Tianjin Naval Hospital? (Answer) Deputy Commander Zhang has absolutely stated that he has not heard of this matter and does not know where it came from. (Question) Has Chairman Chiang recently exchanged telegrams? (Answer) Chairman Chiang has sent letters repeatedly, but they only concern private matters and do not involve politics. Minister Song often visits him. (Question) What is the condition of Mr. Zhang's illness? (Answer) He is deficient in both qi and blood and is only receiving treatment.</p>

<p>丨Unemployed Overseas Chinese are Being Repatriated to China in Succession丨</p>
<p>Shen Jinding, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, went to Europe last year under the order of the Ministry to participate in the work of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations in Geneva. After the matter was completed, he also inspected the political situation in various European countries. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon on the Russian Empress ship and is scheduled to take the night train to Beijing tonight to report. Reporters from the Xinsheng News Agency visited him this morning at his residence. Mr. Shen made the following statement:</p>
<p>Sympathetic to Us Director Shen said that he was ordered to go abroad to attend the League of Nations and assist the Chinese delegation in dealing with the Sino-Japanese issue. He spent four months in Europe. After the League of Nations adjourned, he inspected England, France, Germany, Austria, Holland, Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, and returned to China in early March to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and resume his position as Director of the Asian Department. He has many impressions as a result of inspecting various countries in Europe. However, according to the custom of diplomats, he is not convenient to publish or criticize anything before making a formal report to the government. However, generally speaking, the atmosphere in various countries towards the Chinese issue is the same, sympathetic to us.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Returning to China Many overseas Chinese in Europe have recently been affected by the global economic panic. At the same time, due to their limited financial resources or being deceived, many overseas Chinese have been stranded abroad. This situation affects the image of the country. The embassies and consulates abroad are doing their best to repatriate unemployed and stranded overseas Chinese. France, where the number of unemployed overseas Chinese is relatively large, has been repatriated in batches by the embassy in France. The rest, such as Holland and Belgium, are also underway. It is expected that it will be realized soon. The funds are issued by the government.</p>

<p>丨More Than 10,000 Troops Under His Command Go From Tacheng to Xinjiang to Enter Chahar丨</p>
<p>Today's newspaper reported that Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, and others led more than 10,000 old troops to return to China from Europe, arriving in Tacheng. According to Du Xinwu, Ma Zhanshan's secretary, Ma Su's troops were accommodated in Moscow, Russia, and transferred to Tacheng. Then, they went to Dihua, Gansu, and then to Ningwu to open to Chahar Province. There is a railway in Russia from Moscow to Tacheng. From Tacheng to Dihua, there is a long-distance bus. From Dihua to Ningxia, transportation is quite inconvenient. East of Ningxia, there are highways and the PingSui Railway. In total, the whole journey is quite tortuous. It is not known when they will arrive in Chahar. Ma Su and others decided not to take this route to return to China. They will leave the Russian capital on the 14th of this month and go to Germany, Italy, and other countries to return to China by sea.</p>
<h3 id="e276">The Municipal Government Sends a Letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to Discuss Factory Inspection Methods <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the inspection of factories in this city, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has been actively carrying out inspections since the Central Government promulgated the Factory Inspection Law. However, the concession suddenly proposed to carry out its own inspections. The municipal government believes that this matter concerns sovereignty and that factory inspections are part of China's entire labor administration. The concession should not overstep its authority. It has repeatedly sent personnel to negotiate, but without success. The Secretariat of the Municipal Government sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession yesterday, explaining the importance of factory inspections in the concession being carried out by the Chinese government, and expressed its willingness to sincerely discuss proper methods with the concession authorities within the scope of not conflicting with the Central Government's laws in order to implement the law as soon as possible. The original letter is recorded as follows: The undersigned respectfully states that the Mayor has issued a large letter regarding the proposal of the concession authorities to convene a special meeting of taxpayers to amend Article 34 of the Land Regulations, so as to manage factories. The government has also been instructed to investigate the promulgation of the Factory Law to improve labor conditions and promote harmonious labor-capital relations. Factories in the special zone account for about two-thirds of the city. If they are not implemented at the same time, not only will inspections be impossible to carry out, but factories outside the special zone will also have an excuse. Therefore, personnel have been sent to negotiate repeatedly, but without success. The Municipal Council cannot set separate labor regulations in the special zone for taxpayers to abide by (the Council's legal advisor, Mr. Lai De, said this in 1925). Therefore, it wants to amend the appendices to obtain a legal basis for managing factories. It is not known that inspections are set up to implement China's labor policy, and its purpose is to promote the sound development of the entire national economy, which has nothing to do with local governance. Therefore, the Municipal Council cannot invoke the ninth article of the Yangjingbang Regulations, "Plan ahead for proper management," to seize the power of factory inspections by any means. It must be known that the territorial rights in the concession still belong to our country, and the people in the concession naturally have the same obligation to obey the will of the state as the people living outside the concession. The concession authorities cannot pass a resolution to push the people in the concession outside the power of the state. In short, the government believes that the factory inspection in this city belongs to China's entire labor administration and cannot be abandoned. However, in order to implement this law as soon as possible, it is willing to sincerely discuss proper methods with the concession authorities within the scope of not conflicting with the Central Government's laws, etc. We hereby inform you and ask you to investigate. Sincerely, Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, Shanghai Municipal Government Secretariat.</p>

<p>丨The Result of Arriving in Xinjiang Province is Good, and the Northwest Route Will Soon Be Open丨</p>
<p>The Eurasian Aviation Corporation's Northwest Route was previously telegraphed within Xinjiang Province, but the local area was unstable. Therefore, it only opened to Gansu. This morning, according to Mr. Li Jingzong, the manager of the company, the situation in the area is not as serious as the telegraphs say, and the Eurasian flight is imminent. Therefore, a plane has been sent to inspect the truth. The plane took off from Shanghai last Wednesday, and reported that the progress was smooth along the way. However, it was blocked by strong winds and rain in Xi'an and suspended for one day. Yesterday, a telegram reported that it had arrived in Suzhou. If the weather is good, it can enter Xinjiang Province today. If it is not affected by the climate on the return trip, it can return east to this place at the end of this week. He also said that Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua came to Shanghai and talked about the development of the flight. He attached great importance to the company's planned Cantonese-Hankou route and hoped that it could be opened as soon as possible. However, the company is now scheduled to implement the Eurasian flight at the end of this month. Therefore, it is planning with all its strength to achieve it on schedule. After this matter is completed, it will start planning the Cantonese-Hankou route.</p>

<p>The Hongzhen Fire Brigade held a trial run of its newly arrived pumper car at the association hall on the afternoon of the day before yesterday around 2:00 PM. Those who came to the venue to watch included Dong Zhihe, representative of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Feng Bingjun of the Zhabei Fire Brigade Joint Association, Wang Baoyu of Section 1, Yan Miaojin of Section 2, Zhang Huimin of Section 3, Chen Yousheng of Section 4, etc. They all praised the high and far water output. After the trial, they had some refreshments and took a group photo before dispersing. However, it was heard that the director of the association, Yuan Shixun, said that although the fund for the pumper car had been generously donated by enthusiastic comrades, the purchase of belts and the monthly recurring expenses all required money. If they requested the Municipal Public Security Bureau to forward the appropriation request again, it would not be approved. It is planned to submit a petition immediately.</p>

<p>Residents of Ruihefang and Gaofufang on Hongjiang Road in Zhabei, this city, suffered hardship last year due to the impact of the war. In order to ask the owners to reduce the rent, the owners agreed to reduce the rent of residential houses from 34 yuan to 30 yuan, and the rent of storefronts from 70 yuan to 67 yuan. However, the owners recently suddenly stated that the market had recovered and refused to reduce the rent. They also asked the 5th District Police Station to send police to collect the rent in full. Five residents, including Tan Jinping, Mao Yuzhong, Ding Zhide, Chen Dongshun, and Xi Xianwen, were arrested on the spot. The residents of the two blocks believe that the owners unreasonably incited the police to arrest the residents. This morning, they invited more than 100 residents to the Municipal Government in Fenglinqiao to petition and sent representatives Lu Jiliang, Jin Yibin, Wang Yansheng, and Fu Shand to see the mayor. Mayor Wu sent representatives to meet them and promised to investigate the truth and deal with it accordingly. The representatives believed that the Municipal Government's promise to investigate was a satisfactory result and dispersed, waiting for a solution.</p>

<p>丨The Arrest by Detectives丨</p>
<p>On the morning of the 8th of this month at 10:30 AM, the Tongkang Paint Shop at No. 32 Jinyu Lane, Edward Road, was suddenly invaded by five robbers. Four of them, each holding a pistol, forced the fourteen employees of the shop into one room to guard them and began their robbery. They stole 518.50 yuan in foreign banknotes and 140 yuan in silver dollars from the donation box and counter. Still unsatisfied, they continued to search the employees, seizing five gold watches and 18 yuan in silver dollars, before fleeing. After the shop reported to the Laozha Gate Police Station, yesterday, the police station dispatched Chinese Detective Zhang Yuanqing, detectives Wang Yifei and Weng Hongdong, along with Tongkang's staff Zhang Jialin and Chuan Linfu, to search diligently at various game halls and public places. At 10:30 PM, at the Tianyunlou game hall in the Wing On Company, Zhang and Fu reported to the detectives that they had just seen a tourist wearing a light gray overcoat who was one of the robbers from the shop robbery yesterday. The detectives then went to arrest him and brought him back to the police station. He was identified as Zhang Yingen, also known as Qu Jingen, a Shanghai native. Seventy-five yuan in banknotes, a Hong Kong silver coin, a Heping brand wristwatch, and one yuan in silver dollars were found on him, all of which Fu confirmed as stolen items. The detectives then went to Zhang's residence at No. 65 Fengyu Lane, Route Sapey, in the French Concession and arrested his mistress, Li Ruxun (22 years old, from Songjiang, previously engaged in prostitution). They also seized two gold wristwatches, a gold chain, two gold watches, a long gown, seven pawn tickets, and 134 yuan in banknotes, bringing them back to the police station and detaining them separately. Later, in the French Concession on Route Aigre, they also arrested an accomplice, Xue Lianzhang from Ningbo. This morning, they were jointly transferred to the First Special Court's Criminal Division One. According to the police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, who explained the case, Zhang was initially prosecuted under Article 248 of the Criminal Law. The criminal acts of Li and Xue were still under investigation and were permitted to be detained. Judge Qian Hongye briefly questioned the defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e283">Resistance Against Japan and Boycotting Japanese Goods <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>The national crisis has reached a point of life and death! "Active military resistance" and "passive economic sanctions" are recognized as the only means to respond to Japanese imperialism. Not only is this known, but it has been repeatedly declared from various angles, with vows to do so. For example, those in power have made "vows" of resistance, "oaths of mobilization," "vows to defend the territory to the death," and "vows not to return alive." Those below have made "vows not to buy," "vows not to sell," and "vows not to use" Japanese goods. Moreover, the significance of "vows" lies not only in showing sincerity and honesty that Heaven and Earth can witness, but also contains a subtle sense of humor, enough to greatly intimidate Japan. It seems that every time a "vow" is made, it is as if pointing to the sky and drawing on the ground, aiming at Japan and saying: "Little Eastern barbarian! I am betting on a curse here, 'cursing' to fight you. Little one, aren't you afraid? Humph! 'Just you try!'"</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Japanese are really stubborn and bastards. It seems they have clearly learned that these soundless and shapeless, weak "curses" are no different from an old woman's cursing chickens and dogs. Therefore, they consistently maintain an attitude: let you curse, I'll do what I want. After achieving victory, they even announce the facts like "white lice crawling on clothes," "eating people and shaming people," truly unafraid of infuriating those who made the curses!</p>
<p>At the end of last year, newspapers had the following record:</p>
<p>"Recently, the price of Japanese currency has fallen, and the anti-Japanese boycott has invisibly declined. Japanese merchants are vying to import various goods, hoping to make a fortune. In total, Japanese goods imported into this port in one month reached about ten thousand tons."</p>
<p>According to the recent announcement by the Japanese Ministry of Finance, Japan's exports to China (i.e., our imports) in February of this year amounted to 32,263,000 Japanese yen. Although the figures for March have not yet been released, inferring from this huge number, as well as the prosperous business of various stores and the peaceful scene throughout the country, it is better for the Japanese Ministry of Finance to show mercy and not publish the numbers, so as not to scare the patriotic elements who "dare not lag behind others in their love of the country!"</p>
<p>During this intense month of boycotting, so many Japanese goods were re-imported. This must be a new invention of Japanese science, secretly giving Japanese goods wings or four legs, so they automatically "fly" and "run" to stores that have "vowed not to buy" or "sell" Japanese goods, and then "fly" and "run" to the homes of good people who have "vowed not to buy" or "use" Japanese goods! Therefore, the great responsibility of boycotting Japanese goods in the future can only be borne by the Indians, as suggested by a certain diplomat!</p>
<p>As for the anti-Japanese war of "what vows, what vows," how is it going? It only needs to take the obvious facts of the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe as the "addend," and then take the recent "denials" with words and the "black squares" without words, the implied meanings commonly seen in the newspapers, as the "addends." A simple "addition" will give us the true "answer" we seek!</p>
<h3 id="e284">Another Shortcut for Converting Silver Taels to Silver Dollars <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Ouyang's article "A 715 Shortcut for Converting Silver Taels to Silver Dollars" in the April 6 issue of this publication, I find the calculation ingenious and admirable! However, I believe that this type of mnemonic, similar to the flying return in abacus calculations, is difficult to remember without thorough study. Moreover, because it involves too many digits during calculation, it is not easy to apply, and I still feel it has some shortcomings. I now have another shortcut method, briefly described below for the readers' research.</p>
<p>The reason is that when we usually convert silver taels into silver dollars, we need to divide the number of silver taels by the customs duty (洋釐). Because it requires the application of division, the calculation procedure is more troublesome. According to arithmetic principles, dividing number B by number A is exactly equivalent to multiplying number B by the reciprocal of number A (since A / B = B × I / A). Therefore, if you want to convert the number of silver taels into the number of silver dollars, you can multiply the number of silver taels by the reciprocal of the customs duty, so as to avoid the tediousness of the division procedure. For example, if you want to convert 367 taels of treasury silver into silver dollars according to the legally defined customs duty of 715, the formula for using division is as follows:</p>
<p>Number of taels 367</p>
<p>丨丨丨丨丨=513.29 yuan.</p>
<p>Customs duty 0.715</p>
<p>If using multiplication, the formula is as follows: Number of taels ×丨丨=367丨丨=365×1·3 Customs duty 0.715</p>
<p>986=513.29 yuan. The reason is that according to the legally defined customs duty of 715, one tael of treasury silver should be equal to 1.3986 silver dollars. Therefore, when converting silver taels into silver dollars, one should multiply the number of silver taels by 1.3986. The principle is very clear. Now that the customs duty is legally defined, it must not change. Therefore, the number 1.3986 also remains fixed. In order to simplify the calculation procedure, this number can be abbreviated as 1.4. According to this simplified number, the difference from the original real number is only 0.0014 yuan, that is, when using 1.4 to multiply the silver taels to find the number of silver dollars, each tael of silver is calculated to be 1.4 hao of a silver dollar more, a hundred taels calculate one jiao and four fen of a silver dollar more, and a thousand taels calculate one yuan and four jiao more, which can be corrected during conversion. Let's still use the previous question as an example, using the shortcut method to calculate as follows:</p>
<p>367 × 1.4 = 513.80 yuan.</p>
<p>513.80 丨(3.67 × .14) = 513.80 丨.51 = 513.29 yuan.</p>
<p>In the previous formula, 3.67 × .14 is the number of silver dollars over calculated when converting silver taels into silver dollars using 1.4 to multiply the silver taels, so it must be subtracted. The number to be subtracted is the same as the product in the upper half of the previous formula, so there is no need to calculate it. Just move the decimal point up three places. Since the number of silver taels to be converted into silver dollars is in the hundreds, the number to be subtracted should be in the jiao.</p>

<p>— Ping</p>
<p>(1) Death</p>
<p>Being sick is not my exclusive privilege. In the experience of every patient, whether it's just a fever or chills, the frightening word "death" easily floats up in their consciousness. My father died of illness, my cousin died of illness, my friend died of illness, how can my illness be an exception? Many terrifying images are gathered around the tent door, and I feel like I might die at any moment, but finally, I get out of bed. All the terrible images of death are driven out of my memory, replaced by bread in my mind. Apart from suicide, death isn't that easy, is it?</p>
<p>(2) Spring</p>
<p>Spring has drifted into the world, and sentimental poets sing beautiful verses, and green willows and peach blossoms are even more praised in words. I seem to remember that it's time to sweep the graves. Drifting at sea for nearly five years, my hometown is thousands of miles away. Is the grass on my father's grave still as lush as when I left? I'm afraid my old mother's head will be covered with frost-like white hair? What does each spring bring me? Adding a mark in age is the path to death. Spring, can you give me one last hope? The sound of a car comes from outside the window, telling me that it is going to Longhua to sweep the graves. I lean on the windowsill, looking southwest, Spring, give me one last hope!</p>
