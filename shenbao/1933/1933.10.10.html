<p>近年以來，小學敎科用書，因著作界及出版業之努力，與夫政府之規盡審查，其内容已逐漸標準化。小學兒童之課外謂物則異是··舊式小說是不適宜於兒童理智訓練或情緒訓練之用者仍佔勢力；新近出版之兒童贖物　亦偶優良作品，然潦率而無系統者至多；按其内容，其興舊式說部相類者亦後不少。課外贖物之作用本在輔助正課而增加其效能。今此類贖物不但不能補敎本及敎室之所不逮，且足使兒童從敎本或敎室所得之正確知識或正當意念，易於摇動或消減。此誠小學育當前一個嚴重問題而有待於出版界之重大努力者也</p>
<p>兹者商務印書館同人特編訂一種兒童課外贖物，名爲小學生文庫，册數甚衆其範圍廼可涉及文藝史地以及自然界之種種常識；或著或譯，執筆者率屬專家蓋欲使時許多不良之兒童贖物得到有益之替代物此種企回之成功程度如何，社會自有正確之評價，不佞不欲妄參意見。惟冀爲家長者，爲小學敎師者，以及敎育專家，對於此類努力，各各予以嚴密之注意，以期小學敎育當前的一個嚴重問題，能早日得到一種完美的解决商務印書館編印小學生文庫，用意甚佳值兹國難當前，根本救國之道，自須從初等敎育着手。故去年以來，諸如革新小學組織，設置短期小學，提倡小學二部制，釐訂小學課程，改良小學敎材，編募小學敎科書，及充實小學設備，舉凡足以使小學内容臻於切實者，政府均亟謀進行，不遺餘力。小學生文庫之編印，其有助於此種改革政策之處。自極可貴，且一經出版，深信其必爲社會所歡迎。惟有須愼重者··兒童讀贖物，關係兒童一生者兹鉅，兒童欲讀贖無書，爲害尙淺，讀面不得良書，則其貽害，將終其一生。余於敎育部任内曾頒行兒童課外讀物目録，亦因中國兒童讀物極端缺乏，故選擇書目備感困難。現在小學生文庫，正在編印，主其事者，自於此點，已加注意，更贅一言以示共勉耳。二十二年十月四日　　合</p>

<p>上海市兒童幸福委員會會長　吴鐵城</p>
<p>現在的兒童，就是將來國家的主人翁，假使兒童在幼年時代受不到充分的訓導，聘來成人後，亦難成爲國家的健全份子。所以兒童敎育的重要，是現代敎育家一童承認的。我國對於兒童敎育案來漠視貧苦人家的兒童，不必說了，終日嬉戲路　受不到一點敎育就是經濟力寬裕的家庭亦不遇把子女送進學校，就稱責任已盡所以入學的兒童往往老守着幾本敎科書，再無其他補充讀物供給他們在　外　　　　情形一半是由於社會漠視兒童，一宇是由於出版界對於兒童補兒讀物産量太少現在商務印書館編印了一［小學生文庫，］很可彌補這種　憾　　金人類　　　帶包捂在内一個小學校或家庭購進一部，所費有限，而兒童　益無窮我認爲該文庫的編印確是兒童的　當，故　爲之介紹。</p>

<p>胡叔異</p>
<p>從前——要讀書而面無書可讀</p>
<p>現在——不但有書讀而且有完美的系統的書可讀</p>
<p>比起來，在容易獲得讀物這點上，現在的兒童是幸福得多了。在我們幼小的時候，除非我們不想看什麽書，否則紙有那些惡俗不堪蠅頭細字的舊小說供你閱讀這種書見解之陳腐，插回之陋劣，在在使我們感到不滿意。不遇在那樣兒童讀物［書荒］的時代有什麽辦法呢當時稱得起眞正兒童讀物的祇有商務印書館出版的孫毓修先生所譯述的幾種書。這幾種書自然種種方面都比那些惡俗的舊小說爲好，爲有意思。不過因爲風氣關係，在當時還不能有什麽偉大的影響。然而孫先生開山之功，自不可没，面商務之能出版這種書，亦可謂有先見之明了。</p>
<p>自是而後，兒童讀物經人一再提倡，便蓬蓬勃勃的大有生氣起來，到得如今，兒童讀物數量之多，門類之雜，大非普比。而所謂［兒童讀物著作家］這一類人，也一天多如一天。書店競以出兒童書籍爲牟利之工具，於是量日多面質　下。列其缺點當有如次··</p>
<p>（一）不合兒童心理；（二）不能供給正債的知識和意識（三）偏重低級趣味（四）文字組織不合。</p>
<p>以上四點，當然皆各有其致此之原因。如各兒童讀物作家以爲兒童童讀物易作，或以爲兒童讀物，祇須給以滑稽，則就離免組製濫造，或隨意將外國讀物割裂竄改，弄得不倫不類。或則硬造笑話，強弄［血頭，］以爲别有興趣。要之皆爲錯訛之想頭，無有價值者也。旣就兒童讀物中往往特重兒童文學之一傾向而言，其起因要亦不外［興趣］二字，雖然提倡兒童文學者自有其說，以爲足以發展兒童之情緒，想象，足以增進精神生活；實則未必盡然。凡不能供給正確之智識與意識，以及合理之理性者，胥不能謂之良好兒童讀物也。商務印書館有鑒於此，乃發爲宏願，創編小學生文庫。該文庫各科兼包，門類完全，綱舉目張有條不紊。在目前兒童讀物良莠不齊，汗牛充棟的時候，單單在選書這點上已可供給不少便利。而在經濟上，因爲整個的計劃，和零散的編印書籍不同，自亦可省卻不少。卽此二點，小學生文庫已自有其相當之價值。兹更進而檢討其内容··則發見一絶大之優點，卽分量分配之得當是也。科學和社會科學佔其大部，文學則鼎足面而三，此點頗可矯正現在一般兒童讀物偏重文學之弊。自然科學方面，動、植、礦、生理、衛生、機械及其他一切輕便工藝，均甚完全；社會科學方面，包括史、地、風俗習慣、公民等項；文學方面，中外著名作品，亦大略完備。就其範圍而論，足供小學生全部之需要。他如文字淺顯，編制醒目，能令兒童閱之，一目瞭然，絶無晦澀牽強之弊，此點旣足以增進兒童閱讀之能力，對於兒童文字發表，亦不無有相當之幫幇助。直可謂一舉兩得也。至於插圖方面，旣豐富，又精美對於兒童之美術趣味。當亦可增進不少，不僅輔助内容之了解而已。如此完美如此有系統之兒童讀物，在國内尙屬創舉。而際此一般兒童讀物均在粗製濫造之時，此書之出尤覺其有無窮之意義焉。我們應爲現代兒童慶幸！</p>

<p>王雲五</p>
<p>我從前主編萬有文庫，爲中等學校及一般　書館作整個的　　，　果因這部書面成立的圖書館多至數千我的努力總算没有落空但是學校中需要圖書館的不限於大學中學，就是小學校也　有設　圖書館的必要。</p>
<p>項今啟育家盛偶自動敎育。我　一　學校要實行自動敎育，至少須有三項準備··（一）明起兒童自　　書的興　；（二）培養兒童自　　書的能力（三）　集各種　合於兒童的補充讀物。這三項中，　充讀物之　集，　　尤其　要。因爲没有適宜的書，便難引起兒童　書的興趣　更無從培養他們讀書的能力。</p>
<p>現在新式的學校中除敎科書外　選要采塲各種補資料，使各科内容更爲豐富。在上課以前，使學坐分須閱讀補充讀物到了上　的時候各人把所得特殊的資料提出來，供大家討論；各人旣都有特殊的　獻，敎室中的興趣自然增加　或者在上課以後　依敎師的指尋，各向圖書館中搜尋補充資料不俄從前大家呆守着一本敎科書以致感覺到功課的乾燥無味。這就是小學校圖書館必需設　之一理由，也就是兒童補充讀物亟待編着之一理由。</p>
<p>見童讀物在量的方面固有積極提倡的必要在　的方面尤非特别注意不可；因爲小時候所讀的書，最足以影響一生的志向和行爲。兒童有求知的渴望，而無辦别的能力。多讀好書便生良好的觀念；多讀無益的書便受惡影響。小時候讀書所養成的觀念後來是難改變的。</p>
<p>我圖書館汗牛充楝，然足供兒童——尤其是現代兒童——閱讀的寥若晨星。一因我　舊日著作，多談哲理或經國大計不適於兒童的曁織　城。一因小學校改授降體文以來，舊有讀物，辭　較深，亦非兒童所能了解。　有還俗讀物類多請淫海盜，或提倡迷信。免童識字以後，尋求有趨的讀物，眞和　者求食一般，急不擇食因而　下惡因的也比比皆是。</p>
<p>我們爲　供給戴字兒童精神上的適當食物，所以從事於小學生文庫的編輯。食物須含有種種滋贊元素始能使身體健全讀物也須包括積種有益資料始能使知情與　性並進。本文庫根據此旨，放以人額企智織的羅形爲範圍。第一集五百　中，括有門類四十五。百房中，括有門類四十五。從圖書分類法說起來總類方面有圖書館學和贊書指南等；社會科學方面，有社會政改治、國際、經際、經濟、實業、法律、童子單等；自然科學方面，有算衛、天文、地文、物理、化學、讀物、地質、生物、植物、動物等；應用技術方面，有農業、工業、工程、生理　生等藝術方面，有勞作、美術、音樂、　　等；　文文學方面，有國語文、神話、童話、寓言、故事、　語、詩歌、劇本、美能、短篇小說、長篇小說等；史地方面有史地、地理、傳記歷史等。其中自然科學與應用技衛兩大類合占一耳五十九量興、語文文學兩大類合占一百六十六册的相差無幾。此外史地一類，　占了一百零六册道也是　於我國人科學知識的缺乏和史地眼光的錯誤；故特别注重。至於文　讀物，當然占最多數；不過　材方面，也格外賣愼，於維持兒童想像　像感的需要中，不使其理智與總性受不良的影響。至以編制而論，自然科學——尤其是理化、工樂、工程等——方面，因我國兒意的觀察機會遠不如外國兒童故在外國兒童一言可以明白的，對於我國兒童不能不多方解說，以助認　文學方面取材於舊籍的除原來極淺顯者外，無不譯爲語體文，以側了解；取材於外國的，也力求　合國情其他各方面都本着此項宗旨。</p>
<p>本文庫的編印目的萬有文庫相同，一方在以整個的圖書館用書館用書賣獻於小學校，一方采用經濟的興適當的排印方法，俾小學校得以四五十元之代價獲得五百册最適合兒童需要的補充讀物，而　立圖書館的基礎全書四十餘類每顚特備一種封面，表示各該類的特質，無形中養成科學分類的觀念同時書面上也　次各印一號碼。因此。凡以木文庫成立的小學校　　館儘可由小學生論流管理，無須有專員主持，道也是我們爲學校節當經費的一點微意。</p>
<p>後我們遷要聲明，就是國内兒童義物的編着還在試驗時期，我們請於本文庫的編輯固然格外愼電，但同人願　　雖宏能力有限，關於取材編制的缺點　在所不免。部海内兒童敎育專家，不吝指正。讀物之責者，其選擇書籍之目標，亦因兒童的個性爲轉移，此固無背於個性敎育原理然片面知識的畸形灌輸；亦爲敎育家所不贊許。我們爲免除此弊，乃以全人類知識雛形爲範圍，採取種種有益的資料，編印一部比較有系統的小學生文庫作爲兒童精神的食糧。此計劃始於民國十八年，由王雲五先生擬定門類編就書目，幾經修正，交由編譯所同人分别擔任編輯，同時委託國内兒童敎育專家，兒童讀物著作家，文藝作家，及各科專門學者撰稿。承海内人士不棄，熱誠相助，截至民國二十年冬，稿已大半就緒，且排成多種，擬於民國二十一年春季各小學校開學時開始預約。不幸民國二十一年，突遭一二八之變致行將出版之小學生文庫，</p>

<p>現今敎育家都主張自動敎育鼓育，鼓勵兒童自已讀書，並僉認兒童補充讀物，爲達到此目的之工具。商務印書館爲適應此種需要，首先創刊兒童世界，同時編印各種兒童補充讀物，如［兒童文學叢書，］［兒童史地叢書，］［兒童藝術叢書。］［兒童手工叢書，］［兒當理科叢書］等，出版以來，便利家庭與學校不少；然選擇者往往顧此失彼，例如此一兒童好閱讀文學方面讀物，彼一兒童好閱讀史地讀物，而負選擇</p>

<h3 id="c13">統制經濟聲中日［滿］經濟統制的現狀武·凊·幹· <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>日本自從［九一八］事變。用武力佔據東三書以後。便隨着用政治經濟的力　。　極進行她們經濟侵略的工作。所謂［日滿經濟統制］的論調。當即高唱入雲。到了現時。東省的主要産業和經濟事業。便都已在日本的統治之下。我們現在也正盛倡着經濟統制。並且自全國經濟委員會日前成立後。産業統制的計劃。也已在實施中。但不知對於這整個兒的東省。葬送於［日滿經濟統訪］的事實。大家又作什麽感想。</p>
<p>查［日滿經濟統制］的口號提出。還不到兩年。而其所收的實際效果。却已非常可　。原來日本對於東省經濟侵略的目標。不出交通産業貿易各方面。現在便就這幾項所表現的事實來考查一下。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ</p>
<p>先就交通方面考察。日本在東省的南滿鐵路。在事幾以前。本已具有莫大的墾斷能力。事變以後。更以滿鐵爲中心。着手擴大牠所支配的東三省鐵道網。吉會鐵路是業已全線告成了。日本人自謂這是日滿經濟確立的第一步。（見上月份日本出版的經濟政治界雜誌）爲着要完成這一步的工作。他們主張大規模的沿着吉會鐵路移民。尤其要在吉敦和敦圖兩線區域。爲的更加易於開發。其他東省各鐵路。也都已在滿鐵的委任經營之下。比外更由滿鐵貸欵的名義。建築敦化圖門江鐵路。拉法。哈爾濱鐵路。泰東。海倫三大路線。建築費要達一萬萬金元。就中敦圖線的圖們江。過橋。就達朝鮮的穩城。這更可以收［滿鮮］聯絡的效果了。</p>
<p>在東三省各鐵路中。中東鐵路因爲有蘇俄的利益關係。日本一向是無可如何的。但自本年六月下旬以來。日本便已着手於取買的交涉。刻下雖還没有成功。但以日人威嚇利誘政策的同時並進。遲早恐怕終要爲滿鐵所吞併呢。</p>
<p>日人對於東省交通事業的統制。除鐵路外。其他各種交通事業。近來也都已完全爲日人所襲斷着。例如航空路線。自由本建設僞國後。便設立所謂日［滿］合辦的［滿洲］航空株式會社。其資本大半就滿鐵會社和住友銀行出的。該線連絡日本之東京大連線。和俄國之莫斯科伊爾庫斯克線。現已成爲歡亞航空路的大幹線。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ</p>
<p>再說到産業方面。東三省現在的重要産業。差不多都已蒙着日［滿］合辯的虛名。而實際全在日本資本帝國主義的統制下。例如煤礦的經營。除滿鐵的撫順。烟臺和本溪湖等煤礦外。便要推日［滿］合辦的［滿洲］煤礦會社。資本達一千六百萬元。僞國和滿鐵各出資本半額。僞國所提供的有北票西安鶴立崗等煤礦。還有舊東北礦務聯合會所屬的復詶·八道溝·阜新·新邱等各煤礦也都在該社統制之下。又如金礦的經營。也由所謂日［滿］合辦的［滿洲採金會社］把持。凡吉黑兩省的砂金鑛。都歸該社開採。資本金達一千二百萬元。大部份是由滿鐵和東拓出資。又東省的　鑛也狠豐富。最近也由日［滿］合辦開掘。又東省煤油事業。新近也由僞國和關東軍特務部。南滿鐵路。以及日本内地資本家。恊商合辦。預備設立精製工塲。</p>
<p>此外其他重要産業。苟非日本獨立經營。便都利用日［滿］合辦的虛名。以求收實施統制的效果。例如電氣事業則有日［滿］合辦的滿洲電氣會社。酒精事業則有日［滿］合辦的滿洲酒精會社。這都是最著的例子。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>再說到貿易方面。日本對於東三省的貿易。自九一八事變後。便已完全實行控制。我們只看現時日本對於東省貿易額的突飛猛進。便可知其統制東省貿易的效果。業已非常顯著了。</p>
<p>先就日本對於東省輸出貨物考察。查東省貿易在日本對外貿易繼額的地位。在一九三一年度爲二·三％。一九三二年爲二·七％。到本年第一季。竟增加到七·一％。試就下表一看。</p>
<p>一九三三年第一季　　一九三二年第一季</p>
<p>千元　　　千元</p>
<p>日本對東省輸出　一五、四○二　二、七三二</p>
<p>東省對日本輸出　四八、九五三　一一、二○九</p>
<p>可知日本對東省出品口貿易的增進。較去年同時期已增加到六倍以上。而同時日本由東省取得的進口原料。也已增加了四倍有餘。這些運往東省的日貨。以麫粉砂糖棉紗綿布紙張鋼鐵機器等項最占重要。我們再看下表。更可明瞭日貸年來對於東省市塲突進的情形。</p>
<p>日貨運［滿］表</p>
<p>一九三一年第一季　一九三二年第一季　一九三三年第一季</p>
<p>千元　　千元</p>
<p>麫粉　　　三八九·六　　七九○·九　　一·四八三·九</p>
<p>細砂糖　　　九六·八　　七○·七　　　　一七四·三</p>
<p>海産物　　　　三·三　　四·五　　　　　一五·五</p>
<p>棉紗　　　　三二·八　　九八·五　　　　七八○·一</p>
<p>紙張　　　　一八·八　　一一·○　　　　二二一·○</p>
<p>鐵製品　　　　九·九　　一六·七　　　　二四一·三</p>
<p>機械工具　　一一·四　　六·四　　　　五八五·七</p>
<p>棉布　一·○三五·六　　三八一·四　　五·○一八·二</p>
<p>上表中增加最激莫過於棉布。這就表示年來僞國設置高率關稅壁壘阻止我國内地棉布移入的結果。華商固有的市塲。便都已由日商取而代之了。日本這些貨品在僞國進口貿易中所佔的地位。踪計要達總額百分之九十以上。也可想見其龔斷勢力之偉大一斑。</p>
<p>再就東省對於日本輸出的貨物來看。自然大部分是供給日本工業的原料品。查本年第一季内東省對日出口的貨。大豆佔總額百分之九二·四。豆餅佔總額百分之八一·五。煤油佔百分之三六。生鐵佔百分之八九·○。牠們出品增進的情形。有如下表所示</p>
<p>［滿］貨運日表</p>
<p>一九三一年第一季　一九三二年第一季　一九三三年第一季</p>
<p>千元　　千元　　千元</p>
<p>大豆　　二·八六九·七　　五·九二一·九　一六·六九八·○</p>
<p>煤油　　二○七·一　　　三七五·二　二·七四一·一</p>
<p>煤炭　　五九·七　　四·○　四·五六二·三</p>
<p>生鐵　　　———　　———　六·一四九·○</p>
<p>豆餅　六·六六五·五　　五·四○六·二　一四·一四七·七</p>
<p>東省這些重要原料品的出口是操　於甚麽人呢。不消說。是完全操於日本三井·三菱·日清（？）等幾個重要進出口行家。據日文滿經濟通信載稱。三井洋行去年一月份經手運銷東省大豆於歐洲的數目爲一千三百四十六噸。今年問時期便已增至三萬九千零八十二噸。可見義勇軍的活動一告停止。僞國的局勢便安定了。日本經濟侵略的目的。也已着着成功了。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>可是日本對於東三省經濟統制的野心實還不止此。一般抱經濟侵略主義的人。他們雖祇盼望日本整個的衣食住問題。可由日滿經濟統制的方法來解决。而懷抱武力征　迷夢的人。却把這種經濟統制的方策。僅僅作爲生服殖民地的</p>
<p>一種工具。將來時機成熟。所謂［經濟統制］便不啻成爲［政治併吞］的代名辭了。我國當局。現時正在講究［全國］經濟統制的計劃。我不知道［東三省］和［熱河］。是否也放在這個［全國］經濟統制的範圍以内。因略述日本對於東省經濟統制的現狀。藉以引起國民深切的法意。</p>

<p>現在列强都在瘋狂的擴充武備。凖備第二次大厮殺。自一九二九年發生世界經濟恐慌以來。餘蘇聯外。各國國民經濟都陷於深遠的瀾泥之中。不克自拔。但軍用工業唯一例外的繁榮着。華府和倫敦兩海軍恊定於一九三六年滿期。但英美日三國現在業已開始拚命的競爭造艦。各國陸軍的擴充和製造最新軍械。那更不用說了。</p>
<p>在軍備競爭的一切方法中。尤以航空熱爲最銳利最兇猛。列强鑒於世界大戰期間及近年日本侵華過程中飛機作用的重大。都作了自已的結論。認爲未來的重新瓜分世界。奪取殖民地市塲及原料産地的鬥爭。將取决於空中戰。而面不是在地面上。所以。在年來列强矛盾緊張的條件下。各國的航空熱。便達到了最高度。譬如拿近四月來震動全世界空軍大操演的消息說吧。本年五月下旬有美國空軍在車境諾克斯砲台附近大操演。參加的軍用飛機達一百三十架。所有密西比河以東之步砲兵及航空隊。均經參與。隨後七月間又有英國空軍在倫敦舉行大操演。參加的飛機達三百八十架。内有重轟炸機一百六十六架。戰鬥隊十二隊。從事假戰者達五千五百人。緊接英國之後。從八月一日起法國空軍在都隆大操演。參加的飛機有百餘架。内有大型機四十架。法國的大操演還未結束。日本又接踵而來。自八月七日起至十一日止舉行東京防空大操演。假想敵爲美國。參加的飛機有數百架。佔地方有一府四縣。人口一千餘萬。七大重要城鎭。其規模之大。爲日軍從來所未有。凡此事實。即是證明各國的航空競爭熱。不是有意取樂。而是反映着目前國際政治的主要趨勞。這一趨勢。就是凖備第二次世界大戰。</p>
<p>二　各國航空工業現狀</p>
<p>在航空的瘋狂角逐中。列强爲要保證自已空軍的飛機充分供給和將來戰時不要被敵人封銷供給來源起見。首先竭力的注意航空工業的發展。除官辦强大的軍用飛機製造廠外。凡居營的飛機製造廠。都受政府方面的特别保護和奬勵。現今幾個主要的國家。都已有了强大的航空工業。</p>
<p>其中美國的航空工業。算是獨占着世界第一位。其在全國經濟中的作用。不特是一門軍用工業。而且成了有民用意義的國民經濟的一部門。在一九二九所謂［繁榮］之年。美國開工的飛機製造廠曾有九二家（共有一○一家）。僱用工人一六·一○五人。開工的飛機發動機製造廠曾有三○家（共有三二家）。工人五·九七七名。同年所出飛達六·○三四架。發動機達七·六四○件。即到一九三○年經濟恐慌襲來之年。其所出飛機亦達三千六百四十架。發動機達三千七百六十六件。要超出世界其餘各國飛機製造額總和之上。</p>
<p>其次要推法英兩國。現在法國有大小飛機製造廠四八家。其中大飛機製造廠有三○家。發動機工塲有十家。飛船製造廠有兩家。其　産能力。每年可出飛機六千架。戰時可增至一萬兩千架。若將現有工廠。加以擴充。採用大量生産方法。則開戰係每月可出飛機兩千五百架。英國現在有大規模的飛機製造廠三五家。開戰後每月生産能力可增至一千二百餘架。</p>
<p>希特勒的德國。雖依凡爾賽和約。軍用航空。完全禁止。但在民用旗幟之下。其航空亦十分發達。全國飛機製造廠有三十二家。在戰時自然可改作軍用。加以設備完善。技術優越。且有十足的保障。日本在世界大戰時。國内尙不能自造飛機。迨至戰後始設廠仿造。現在牠也建立了牠自已的航空工業。民營和官辦大規模的飛機製造廠。已有十家。發動機製造廠有五家。全國軍用飛機和民用飛機。十之八九。已係自造。</p>
<p>總之。目前世界航空工業。大部分是集中在幾個主要的國家手中。世界飛機市塲。全爲牠們所壟斷。</p>
<p>社會主義的蘇聯。其航空工業。亦突飛猛進。在第一次五年計畫四年完成的過程中。其飛機生産在數量上計增加了三倍。在容量上計增了五倍。發動機則增了六倍。其軍用和民用飛機及零件。目前均可自造。而不需外國供給了。　三　列强對於空軍的角逐</p>
<p>飛機因其高翔天空。無所阻碍及速率敏㨗的原故。所以它在軍事上便有下列諸優點··</p>
<p>（一）在進攻戰時。可以助助主力軍（如放烟幕彈。偵察敵軍所在地等）前進··</p>
<p>可以出其不意的轟毁敵國誠市。工廠及大建築物。致使敵人軍心動摇。國民情緒荒亂。</p>
<p>（二）可以偵伺敵軍活動。使其行動只限於夜間。而白晝簡直無移動之可能。　　（三）可以毁壞敵國交通機關。使其愋兵和糧秣供給遲　或斷絶。</p>
<p>（四）可使戰線　大至敵人全國。深入敵人腹地。摇動全國人心。無法收拾。　　（五）運　敏㨗。司以迅速而靈活的手段接濟本軍被圍的前鋒部隊軍火和糧𥞊�</p>
<p>。及援救傷兵等。</p>
<p>而且上述諸點。不僅是理論上的闈述。而在第一次世界大戰及［九一八］後日本侵華戰爭中。飛機確已演了那些威力。所以列强受了這些敎訓。都看準了飛機在第二次世界大戰中是殺人最有效力最易制勝的主要工具。都拚命的去擴充空車。</p>
<p>近年來雖然在經濟恐慌的條件下。列强的預算都是巨額的虧空。然而其軍費較之世界大戰前夜—一九一三—一四年度。都是大大增加了。其中尤以空軍費的增加爲最厲害。這由下表可看出來。</p>
<p>一九三一—三二年度列强軍費表（一九一三—一四年度爲一○○）</p>
<p>國名　　陸軍費　　海軍費　　空軍費　　全部軍費</p>

<p>日本　　一八八　　二七九　　　　　　　　二三五</p>
<p>（註）美日空軍費係包括於海陸軍費以内。故未分别指出。</p>
<p>就空軍實力言。列强準備的成績。都很可觀。據一九三一年末調查。下一表</p>
<p>一九三一年末列强空軍實力表國</p>
<p>國名　　　隊　　　數　　　飛機數（架）　　兵員（名）</p>
<p>（正規）———七五</p>

<p>日本————（爆擊）————四　　八○○　五·八○○</p>
<p>（共計）———二八</p>
<p>（氣球）————二</p>
<p>不用說。這只是就已公開的敎字而言。換一句話說。只是就各國所正式公佈的最低數字而言。其實每個國家的武備實力。不論海陸軍或空軍，都是秘而不宜。同時。每個國家都擁有大批民用飛機作後備力量。戰爭一旦爆發，即可編入軍用。總之。在戰時列强的空軍。都可比上表所列的數字要激增數倍。那是可斷言的。</p>
<p>四　世界民用航空</p>
<p>本來航空術的發明。是近代科學和技術上的一大成就。它的眞正偉大價值。就在給人類在跟自然界鬥爭中許多新的卓越的方法。主要者譬如。</p>
<p>（一）經濟方面—在農業上可利用飛機播種。驅逐田禾害虫。在漁業上可利用飛機搜索魚羣。在廣大的森林面積上可利用飛機偵察火災等。</p>
<p>（二）科學方面—可利用飛機探險高山絶頂。火山及噴火口。兩極探險時可藉助飛機偵　冰塊情形。氣象學上可用飛機觀測高空氣象和天體。以及測量山嶽。空中攝影。製作地圖。計劃都市建設等。</p>
<p>（三）交通運輸方面—因飛機速率極大。使空間距離。更大大縮近。自英國産業革命以來。所發明種種式交通工具如火車。，輪船，汽車等。其速率都遠不及飛機來得大。</p>
<p>（四）文化方面—報館可用飛機採訪新聞和遞送報紙。遇大地震。水災等時。可用飛機援救難民等。</p>
<p>然而飛機的這些優點。除蘇聯以外。在列强看來還没有它在軍事上的價值來得大。所以迄今還很少運用。</p>
<p>目前列强間所發展者只是航空運輸。這，還脫不了軍事的目的。因爲，第一。飛機的進步。一日千里。昨日出廠的飛機。在今日已感覺陳舊。所以，列强不得不把陳舊的飛機拿到民用市塲上去。第二。爲了維持航空工業。繼續工作。不到中斷。以備戰時應用。第三。爲了訓練飛行人材和技術。以應戰時的需要。加以航空旅費很貴。大多數人民還不能普遍享用。所以，現在列强的民用航空。都是政府拿錢津貼辦的。譬如美國根據［ＷatersＡct］每九磅郵件空運一哩。政府津貼四角至一元二角。其多寡隨空線的意義而定。德國政府於一九二八年對民用航空津貼費曾達六千萬馬克。次年因發生經濟恐慌。雖曾减低至三千八百七十萬馬克。但一九三○年復增至四千五百萬馬克。英國政府跟［帝國航空公司］（大英帝國的空中運輸事業。差不多全部握在該公司手中）訂約。在一九二九—三○至一九三○—三一兩年度内。每年津貼三十三萬五千鎊。在一九三一—三二至一九三四—三五諸年度内。每年津貼三十一萬縍。此後每年遞减五鎊。直津貼至一九三八—三九年度。法國政府於一九三○年一年之内。對民用航空津貼竟達兩萬一千萬萬佛郎。意國政府航空費在一九二○—二一年度爲五千六百萬里爾。至法西斯蒂執政後。逐年增加。至一九三○—三一年度竟達至七萬萬一千八百萬里爾。比之前十年約增了十三倍。日本對民用航空的津貼。更其厲害。一九二八八—二九年度計美金二十九萬元。次年竟增至一百三十六萬元了</p>
<p>在政府各方奬勵與津貼之下。近年來列强的空中運輸事業却是積極發展了，據一九三一年所調查的數字。有如下表。</p>

<p>在蘇聯。因其發展方向的不同。民用航空已獲得了各方面的發展。在五年計劃過程中。全國已破航空線聯絡起來。以莫斯科爲中心。東至遠東海參嵗。南至南高加索巴庫。東南至中亞細亞塔什干。西至德京柏林。都已有經常幹線飛行。在目前蘇聯空線長度已居世界第一位。郵運居世界第二位。至其生産航空和科學航空的應用。更爲帝國主義國家所不及了。</p>

<p>此外。蘇聯在中亞細亞。西比利亞及北冰洋等地各種探險中。也曾廣大的應用航空帮助。單在一九三二年。上述各地各種探險中用飛機的地方。總計起來。飛行距離有十七萬萬公里之長。年來蘇聯開發北冰洋的偉大成就。得飛機之帮助不小。</p>
<p>五　航空技術的發展</p>
<p>問題是。不是一國獨有飛機。而是各國都有。因之列强不得不［鈎心鬭角的在航空技術上去設法戰勝自已的敵人。這一競爭的動機。便推使列强不斷地去改良飛機。一九○三年十二月十七日美人萊特弟兄始第一次用裝有發動機的飛機試飛成功。其後逐漸改良。至一九○九年七月間法人布勒利奥更駕飛機飛越英法海峽。那時適值世界大戰之前夜。列强對飛機在軍事上的作用。已十分重視。競相研究改善。在歡戰期間。德國用飛機轟炸巴黎和倫敦。更驚動了參戰國的視線。趕造飛機迎戰。至是以後便展開了列强的航空競爭在。自停戰起至現在　十五餘年間。航空技術的進步。實不可以道里計。從軍事上的價值說來。戰後數年間列强苦心所趕造的飛機。現在都太陳舊而不適用了。</p>
<p>在一九一八年時。航空技術最大的成就。算是三發動機飛機。但現在一九三三年已是十二發動機飛機了。同時。一九一八年時··飛行最大限度的速率每時爲一百三十公里。不停止的飛行最大距離爲五百公里。續航力爲五至六小時。載重量最大限度爲五百公斤。然而現在（一九三三）則大不同了。最大速率已達每小時七百二十公里。一直不停止的飛行距離已達一萬二千六百公里。續航力已達八十四小時。載重量已達十噸。</p>
<p>兹將飛機自發明以來技術發達遇程表列如下</p>

<p>因飛機技術的進步。飛行的安全性。也逐漸增加。事變已减至最低限度。據美國民用航空的材料。在一九一八至二一年諸年間。飛行事變死亡人數平均第十里萬八千六百哩有一人。在一九二二至二五諸年間。每七十八萬九千一百哩才有一人。</p>
<p>以目前種種飛行設備的進步言。在最近的將來。飛機在空中將有不分晝夜飛行的可能。　　一九三三·十·五。</p>

<p>— 林·我·將·</p>
<p>自有史以來。因科學之發明。應用進化而影響及於全體人　之生活。其最著者殆莫如電氣與航空。惟電氣之利用。其效能固甚普遍。然至今日。勞不得不讓後起之航空事業。居其上位。蓋電氣之發明與利用。遠在七十年前。其歷史已成一段落。而飛機則自發明試騐以至利用。不過近三十年間事耳。然而世界文化。因之起絶大變化。於軍事及交通兩者爲才甚。且近年航空之技術及工業。突飛猛進。因其性能發揮功用。航空之前途。殊不可限量。向之恃海陸軍設備完善以稱雄一世者。幾於失所憑藉。至昔日倚賴汽車輪舶以爲交通之命脈者。亦感其遲鈍不便。歐戰以還。列强競相發展軍用及民用之航空事業。以爲其國家圖存改策者。良有以也。</p>
<p>昔胡林翼之圍安慶也。身當大敵無所動。及目擊江面外人汽船行走而驚心。蓋逆料中國之患。不在太平軍。而在外人之將用新發明利器以侵略吾國也。夫自鴉片戰爭以還。八十年來。列强所挾以威脅吾國者。莫非其　發明之大砲巨艦新武器。吾國朝野。於飽經壓迫之後。亦嘗漸明海防之需要。稍稍注意於海軍之建設及沿岸砲台之佈置。惜乎行之不力。至於今日。所謂海防者。不過舊艦數十。廢壘若干。不足以言防也。且每一時代。有其時代之重要性的國防。昔由注重陸軍。又因應時代之需要而建設海軍以事國防。至今日則因科學所生之靈化。趨向於空軍之建設矣。蓋無空軍。則　國防。亦世界所必經之時代性使然也。然則吾人今日見飛機翺翔於空際。能不如胡林翼氏之失驚。知來日大難之何在乎。再按諸事實。則五年來列强業已兩度　空軍之威迫。蹂躪吾國土。創殺吾同胞矣。即民十八蘇俄爲中東路事。以空軍憑陵我邊圉。繼是而有［九一八］［一二八］日本空軍之侵略東北及長江流域。直至現在。日機猶不時出没於華北上空。讀者對此。當亦望空長歎。憂憤塡胸。槪痛吾國空軍實力之薄弱。不足資以禦侮。而暴鄰則無時不可加以空襲而製我之生命也。申報例於雙十節發行特刋。際兹國難時期。擬對航空事業。加以討論。冀使國人明瞭吾國航空狀况及航空與國防之關係。囑爲屬稿。爰略述吾國航空之過去及現狀。並作者所視爲今後吾國發展航空　行注意之事項。以貢獻於讀者。</p>
<p>中國航空事業之初期歷史</p>
<p>查民　前三年。（宣統元年）有法國飛機師環龍氏。携蘇姆式雙翼機來華。於上海表演航空。嗣因試演之際。機裂殞命。今日法租界有馬路名曰環龍。即法人所以紀念此機師也。是吾國人之知飛機爲何物。已在二十五年前矣。至辛亥革命軍起義。擬以飛機攻取北平。乃向奥國訂購伊特立克式單翼機兩架。以期應用。迨飛機運至上海。和議已成。南北統一。乃將此項飛機運於北平南苑。　參謀本部。即在南苑開立航空學校。並置高得龍式雙翼飛機十二架。以爲訓練飛行人員之用。並設飛機塲及修　廠。是吾國人之知利用飛機計劃訓練飛行人才。亦遠在二十二年前矣。自是而後。當局漸注意於飛機製造商用航空及航空行政等問題。故海軍部於民五設學校及製造廠於馬江。民八國務院及交通部先後創立航空事務處。計劃進行。民九冬。遂將兩處合併。十年二月。擴充爲航空署。統籌及管　全國一切航空事業。蓋爲一最高之航空行政機關也。</p>
<p>當時（即民十年）航空置直隸於國務院。其職員爲督辦一人。署長一人。參事二人。廳長四人。秘書僉合技正主事若干人。其組織則有總務處及軍事機械航運經理四廳。處分四科。廳各設三科。觀其組織之繁重。儼然爲一純粹之衙門。而非創辦事業之機關也。除其規劃航空路線干條。（當時計劃重要航綫五條次要者十二條支綫八）訂定航空法規若干　。購置飛機若干架。未見若何之成效。迨直皖戰事起。所有飛機。多運往東三省。奉軍旣得飛機。即於十一年春。在瀋陽成立東三省航空處。其北京航空置所着手籌備之京滬航空線。（北京—天津—濟南—徐州—南京—上海）至是竟成爲　餅矣。</p>
<p>近年中央對於軍用航空設施之一斑</p>
<p>民十五年。北伐軍興。在粤航空局之飛機隊。隨軍出發湘鄂。是年秋。武漢旣克。定都南京。旋於總司令部設航空處。以張靜愚任航空處長兼北伐航空隊司令。收集東路及江右各軍飛機十數架。編爲二隊。隸屬於軍事委員會。十七年春。二次北伐。乃編成航空大隊。出發津浦。迨是年冬。北伐完成。裁撤軍事委員會。成立軍政部。至是中央之航空事業。乃由軍政部設航空署主持之。當時北方除遼寗之航空處外。已無復有航空機關存在矣。</p>
<p>航空署旣於十七年在南京成立。旋任張惠長爲署長。黄秉衡爲副署長。其組織視前北京政府時代之航空署爲簡單。内設署長一人。副署長一人。下設文書管理軍務航務敎育機械六科。行政組織完定之後。即着手於航空隊之編制。前此航空隊各隊之飛機。多寡懸殊。至是乃漸歸統一。成立五隊。每隊有三分隊。並增設參謀機械長無綫電信隊攝影製圖各員。至十九年。增加航空隊至七�</p>
<p>隊。並擴大掩護隊組織。　航空工廠亦相繼成立三所。又因感覺訓練人材之重要。即在首都設立航空學校。此自北伐以還。直至一二八時期。關於中央軍事航空組織及進展之一班也。至於最近一年來。因應時勢之要求。航空署組織及設施方面。均有不少更張。在行政系統。如前所述航空署向屬軍政部。惟前月間。已奉令改隸軍事委員會。其組織條例。亦經立法院審議矣。航空學校。自由南京移至杭州以來。規模亦　新月異。目的在以比較的完善之設備伋精練之敎官。造就航空人才。是以除每年招考飛行科學生以外。並另設機棧科及其他技術之得授。（如空中攝影無綫電等）亦足表示我國當局對於航空事業。具有深切之認識。重視造就飛行及製造人才。爲此後建設空軍之基礎也。最近航空署又爲造就地面對空人才起見。在杭州抗立高射砲班。招考學生學員。業於本月五日在京舉行考試。至於籌設工廠。自行製造飛機。及編練各項航空隊。亦均在進行中。凡諸種種。需費浩大。際兹財政困難。籌謀不易。政府竟能不惜犧牲。力圖改進。實爲我國國防上一新出發點。倘全國均能一致。恊同努力。不斷　起。則吾國空軍之建設。非不可能也。以上關於中央軍用航空之可言者。大致如斯。其詳情則未便任意披露。惟今日吾國發展軍用航空。其困難不僅限於財政。在航空行政之不統一。尤爲非計之得也。蓋目前吾國區區有限之空軍。除隸屬於中央統率訓練指揮之外。西南則另有廣東廣西之空軍。設司令部航空學校兩處。共有飛機百餘架。尙有四川雲南福建獨立之空軍。雖合計不過數十架。而人各爲政。各自定其計劃。各自就地籌欵以舉之。此種現象。不但陷於不經濟狀况。而亦非所以求空防效率增高之道。各國無此先例。其利弊之所在。將於本文後幅詳之　近年中央到於商用航空設施之一斑</p>
<p>國民政府自定都於南京後。不但對於軍用航空。曾有相當之設施。即於商用航空。亦先後舉辦之。前時北京政府設計而未辦之航空線。至是乃得見一部份之實現焉。先是。民國十八年。鐵道部長孫科。與美國航空發展公司。訂立合資辦理中國航運事業合同。嗣因某項關係。雙方同意取消。而將商用航空歸交通部辦地。民十九。交通部長王伯羣。遂與美國飛運公司訂合問。雙方合資　游中國航空公司。資本一千萬元。吾方出百分之五十五。美方出百分之四十五。並由國民政府公佈該公司之管理及監管條例。在交通部主管之下。成立該公司董事會。以董事五人組織之。華三美二。董事會之下。設營業財務及機航三組。營業及財務兩組之權。多由吾方主持之。其關於該公司經營方面。當時曾定航空郵運線三條。即（一）上海成都線。中間經過南　九江漠口宜昌萬縣重慶。（二）南京北平線。經過徐州濟南天津。（三）上海廣州線。經過寗波温州福州夏門汕頭是也。該公司成立後。先辦滬漢航運。繼而試辦京平線。近又試飛滬粤線。惟尙未定期開航。其營業範圍。爲郵件運輸搭載乘客及運送貨物。</p>
<p>該公司組織之情形。大略已如上述。至於該公司之緣起及性質。則前年中國航空公司爲京平漢官兩線開航成功。曾發表紀念特刋。其中所載一段文字。頗足閘明此等意義。兹特録之。可以表見吾國目前與外人合辦商用航空所採之方針。蓋繼中美之後中德合辦之歡亞航空公司。（現已通至迪化）亦大致本此原則辦理也。特刋之文如下。［我國航空事業。昔雖設官　辦。而以國内連年戰亂。旋　旋止。未收成效。迨夫國民政府奠都南京。鑒於世界空防之切要。空運之發達。乃本總理［迎頭趕上去］之精神。深厲淺揭。昕夕以圖軍用航空之充實。固已不遺餘力。然爲行旅圖便利。郵件圖迅㨗。工商圖溝通。文化圖發展。則商務航空之經營。自更不容或緩。以故詢謀僉同。國議以决。十八年春間。明令組織中國航空公司。特派孫部長哲生兼任理事長。與美國發展公司簽訂航空運輪及航空郵務合同。凡滬漢京平滬粤三線。悉歸辦理。旋該航空發展公司　權與其同國籍之飛運公司。十一月間。滬漢線即開始飛行。嗣以情移勢遷。乃復改弦更張。孫部長舍其始事之功。退而觀成。而政府因勢利導。權衡系統。遂以王部長伯羣繼其後。樽俎之間。幾經商榷。卒改由中美兩國合辦。並將交通部原設滬蓉航空處併而爲一。遂成今日實異名同之中國航空公司也。綜其遞嬗結果。就股份言。則我方占其多數。不虞操縱。就用人言。則董事長總經理。皆歸於。我而董事人類。亦比較爲多。會議席上。不虞見絀。惟機航人員。則以事屬草創。除延攬本國專家外。間或借才異國。與總理實業計畫詔示之旨。亦爲相合。他如國法之依據。國文之遵用。墊欵之抵折。利益之攤分。要皆本諸主權衡諸平等。以視往昔我國與國際間合辦事業之片面損失者。相去何如。］讀者覽此。亦可以明瞭其梗槪矣。</p>
<p>交通部除與美國訂約中美合辦航空郵運外。復與德國漢沙航空公司訂立合同。其條件亦略如中國航空公司合辦之情形。惟資本則僅三百萬。吾方出三分之二。德方出三分之一。成立歐亞航空公司。並擬經營以下之三線。</p>
<p>（一）從上海經南京天津北平及滿洲里俄境至歐洲。（以柏林爲終點）</p>
<p>（二）從上海經南京天津北平及庫倫以外之中國邊境通俄境至歐洲。</p>
<p>（三）從上海經南京甘肅及新疆之中國邊境通俄境至歐洲。</p>
<p>查歐亞航空公司所經營之路線。視中國航空公司較難。因所經過。多爲荒凉境域。且向無飛機塲或着陸處。其沿途補充油料或修理機件。至爲不便。自一二八後。因第一二線須經過僞國範圍。故未與辦。目前試飛成功而爲定期之飛航者。厥惟前所擬之第三線而僅能通達於迪化。此線起　上海。經過南京洛陽西安蘭州肅州哈密迪化。計長三千五百一十五公里。航時僅需兩日半。爲吾國與西北邊境最重要最敏捷之交通工具。於國防文化。至有關係。又該公司總理李君景縱。於此航線屢次試飛之際。均不辭艱險。親行視察。吾人希望於最近之將來。歐亞二洲之定期航空郵運。可能實現。（按歡亞航空線業於本年七月試飛成功。當該公司飛機由柏林起飛到達上海時作者曾在虹橋機塲歡迎之）則向之旅行或郵寄需時一月有餘者。兹則不過三四日耳。抑有進者。今日吾國已實行之定期航空線。皆不外爲國内之運航必聯絡歐亞而貫通之。方可成爲國際飛行。而可以有裨於文化經濟及國防也。</p>
<p>發展吾國航空之途徑</p>
<p>以上各項。係就吾國創辦航空之經過及目前槪况之一斑。略爲叙述。俾留心吾國航空事業者。獲以省識前此之得失。夫吾國今日。無論軍　航空商用航空。其距鞏固國防便利交通之標準。尙灟甚遠。而有需乎羣策羣力。從事於航空建設也。以下所舉數端。或根據沂世各國發展航空所取之途徑。或本諸吾國實際之需要。擇要討論。冀使　人對於航空建設幾個根本的問題。有多少認識蓋在今日而言國防。非能徒恃政府必也。人人具有戮力同仇之决心及有犧牲財物生命之精神。然後乃可以言建設航空。鞏固國防。歐洲某名將謂［國防不盡恃夫山川河海之險要。國防之建設。必在乎國民之心理］。即此意也。况在今日。因於航空　發明。空軍之活動。戰端一啓。不分部隊民衆。槪負有守衞防　之責任。並直接同受戰事之影響。蓋無復有如昔日戰時部隊與民衆作前綫與後方之區别。凡敵人飛機可到之處。一切戰爭之慘狀。均得隨時隨地以施演也。一二八之役。前綫固在！在上海附近。而敵機竟一再成隊飛越至蘇州杭州。實行轟炸我方之機塲。至蘇州時。並在蘇城上空低飛。用機關槍掃射。市民男婦死者數十人。今日戰鬥機轟炸機之續航力。已漸增加。敵機不難飛入距吾國邊境威沿海一千里以内之腹地。破壞吾之政治工業商業及交通中心。而吾所恃以抗敵者。亦惟賴乎空軍及地面對空之武器（即高謝砲探照燈等）耳。故今日而言國防。首重航空。而發展航空。要在社會能觀時度勢。造成輿論。提倡航空國防運動。督促贊助政府。速其建設。蓋今日航空救國運動。不啻國民自救之運動也。</p>
<p>（一）確立航空政策　每一國家之建設航空。必具有一定之政策。即决定其空軍爲取攻勢乎。抑取守勢乎。籌備具有對付一國戰鬥力之標準。或爲對於兩國以上之標準。且須認定此假想之敵國在目前。究爲某國或某某等國。察其空軍之境狀如何。以爲其準備對付之標的。以我國之國情而論。則我空軍第一步之準備。但求能守土保境而已。織有時應戰略上之要求。迫而轉取攻勢。固亦爲守而攻也。然而今日我國假想之敵國。究爲何國。或不止一國。已往之事實具在。而侵略之跡象昭然。不問可知也。</p>
<p>（二）航空行政之統一　吾國空軍之不統一。上文業已述及。惟此不統一。關係於</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>將來航空發展者至巨。蓋航空行政不統一。則無論定立若何合時代之航空政策。或商訂若何最完善之航空計劃。槪難實行。縱成行之。亦不能獲得美滿之結果也。故在今日而言統一中國航空行政。厥有兩大意義在也。（甲）所有全國之空軍。應歸中央惟一最高之航空機關主管之。　一國之空軍。若爲不相統屬。則因各處採用之飛機。漫無標準。種類參差。一旦有事。縱令均能集中。亦難期編成隊伍。在一最高司令部指揮之下。行成爲有盤備之作戰。至於空軍人才。更因分散各地。索不相知。平日所受之訓練不同。紀律互異。縱調集之詎能脈絡相應。指臂相隨。不類烏合之衆乎。（乙）所有航空事業。應歸一最高之航空行政機關管理監督之。近年來列强之航空行政。日趨於統一途徑。其創行最先者。厥爲英國。次而法意等國。繼起追隨。舉所有航空（不論陸軍海軍商用）之設計管理執行諸任務。設一航空部。使其負責統轄節制之。以統一航空之行政。增加空軍之效能。就吾國目下之情形而論。欲求航空事業合乎經濟的及得增加效率。似不能任航空事業分隸於軍政及行政各部分也。</p>
<p>（三）設航空製造廠　吾國之航空工廠。除航空署所設之三工廠外（其設於上海虹橋者業於［一二八］爲日空軍炸燬無餘矣）其一爲海軍所辦。另一則設在廣東。然　屬修理工廠性質。鮮能自行制造飛機。此因限於設備材料及製造人才也。惟能否自行製造飛機。關係於航空之前途絶大。蓋自製飛機。不特可免利權外溢。用費低廉。而且一遇戰時。不虞來源之斷絶也。但設立航空製造廠。需要大量資本。政府苟無力衖辦。則用官民合辦之力法亦可。即爲官督民辦。亦無不可。在歐美各國航空製造廠。槪視爲一種大實業之經營。多半集合航空專門人才及企業家。立公司發股票。集民間資本以成之。一九二七年至一九三○年間。爲美國人航空熱。到最高點時代。作者時在美國。目擊其國布面航空股票之高漲及各人爭購之情形。確信美國航空製造。在平時已完全實業化商業化。而其政府之軍用航空機。亦轉因而精銳。蓋政府只將其所研究之結果或所需要之飛機之式類性能。向航空實業界發表之。各廠便能競爲製造。求售於政府。政府則擇其最精良者採用之。故美國航空製造能力。今日確居世界第一。據統計美國現有航空工廠二十八處。若在戰時。統合全國製造之能力。每月可出飛機一千架。成立盛大之空軍。不過指顧間事耳。則航空製造之重要。可以知矣。</p>
<p>（四）訓練航空人才　中央政府近頗注意於訓練航空人才之事。上述中央航空學校。曾經涉及之。惟吾人感覺其規模有限。尙未能容納多數之學生。倘不另設分校。則希望政府訓練此項人才。必將其額擴大至每年可以造就飛行員及機械員各在五百人之數以上。俾三年内果有千五百架之飛機。不慮無駕駛管理修整飛機之人才也。現在中央之外。粤桂二省。已各設航空學校。員近管建。亦由十九路軍當局提倡開辦航空學校一所。大約皆趨重於軍事航空。其中廣東之航空學校。　具規模。惟爲謀吾國以後之空軍發展計。則不但希望空軍之部隊及行政機關。能成統一。即航空敎育。亦須同趨一致。蓋全國有同一之航空敎育政策及方案。則所造就之人才。來源雖有東西南北各省之分。而其學識技術。大致相同。則隨處可以使用。自能因應咸宜也。關於此點。吾人熱望中央航空當局。早日妥立吾國航空敎育之政策及其施行之方案。（如學年敎程敎材敎授法等）招集西南及其他現非中央統屬之航空學校當事者。在京或杭。開一會議。以研究解决一切。則此後中央航空學校成爲全國航空敎育之中心。而其他各省之航校。則爲分校。斯航空敎育之統一司期也。　　此外則希望民間之飛行。能以創設飛行社。而漸見發展。因政府所辦之航空學校。目前偏重於軍事飛行敎育旦且其所能容納之敷目。尙屬有限。每年招考向隅者。常　數百人。則爲造成民衆航空化以展拓航空的經濟關係及國防補充之計劃。對於提倡民間航空之舉。殊不可緩。至設立飛行社之意義及其必要之處。中國航空協會。於前數月。曾經擬有辦法。作者於該項設計書。曾有如左之說明。兹録之以備參考。</p>
<p>［飛行社一名飛行俱樂部。其設立之目的。在提倡民間對於航空事業發生興趣。並於實際方面以比較的經濟及簡單方法。造就飛行人材。所以定名爲飛行社。而不依原來西文ＦlyingＣiub飛行俱樂部者。蓋恐引起民衆之誤會。以爲此項組織。與普通之俱樂部性質相同。主要目的。在消遣娱樂而已。實則此種創設。寓有深意。一方面固爲實施敎練飛行技術。爲國儲備飛機駕駛人員。一方面則因其爲民間之組織無軍事關係。得以公開。使羣衆能隨時參觀。以期推廣社會上航空常識。今日談航空救國。勢必使大衆先有航空認識爲要。即西人之所謂［航空頭腦是也。歐美各强國比項組織。已甚普遍。且推行至於其殖民地。其間尤以英國爲最特色。（有飛行俱樂部五十二個）若印度（已設六處）新加坡香港。均於近年創設飛行俱樂部多處······］。</p>
<p>觀右之說明。飛行社之性質及其創設之必要可知。夫對於造就軍用航空人才。社會及民衆。固不能直接舉辦。若飛行社。則有待於民間創辦。而政府從中提倡扶助之耳。此次航空恊會倡設飛行社。　蒙當局贊許。允其用上海虹橋飛機塲。設備飛機棚廠。及作日常之飛行演習。而南洋烟草公司。亦槪允補助一部分創辦費。倘再有熱心提倡民間飛行者。獨力或合力捐欵。以爲創辦飛行社之用。則創辦費經常費。俱有把握。隨時可以舉辦矣。至原訂飛行社之計劃創辦費。約需十五萬元。經常費則年約六萬元。而每年可望得有訓練飛行員百人之成績。前月孫桐崗君來滬。知航空恊會有將設飛行社之議。極表贊同。且願於全國飛行壯舉完畢之後。犧牲數月光陰。在滬帮助恊會。辦理飛行社訓練學員之事。蓋彼在上海外曾親見德國提倡民間飛行之熱烈。其飛行社幾於各市鎭皆有之。益信吾國之不可長此落後也。作者甚望中國第一個飛行社。不久能在上海出現。以後漸推廣至於各省。使凡欲練習飛行者。咸得成其志願。而空中交通出業。軍事航空。亦有發展之基礎也。</p>
<p>（五）防空設備之重要　世之論空防者。有廣義狹義之分。廣義的空防。包括一切空軍之組織（飛機隊）。地面空防之設備（高射砲深照燈聽音機）。民衆消防避彈防毒之訓練。質言之。凡所以應付本戰及空戰所生之結果者。皆爲空防所有事。狹義的（亦有稱之謂消極的）空防。則止於地面防禦之設備。（即防空）使敵人不得活動於我領空氣界之内。爲偵察破壞之舉者槪屬之。防空之器械。如高射砲等移動之則可以掩護恊助前敵部隊之進展。靜止之則能鞏固各處之要塞砲臺飛機塲火藥庫等。以及保護後方民衆之安寗。物質之安全。運輸交通之穩便。蓋以飛機抗飛機。固爲空戰之原則。然而地面苟無防空之設備。徒恃空戰以應急。則空防仍患不完全。際此國難當前。世界軍備競爭之日。我國人應如何注意於防空之設備及訓練乎。［一二八］之役。日機轟炸上海華界繁盛之區。損失至十餘萬萬倘使當時我方地面設有十數尊或數十尊高射砲。則敵機决不敢如是横行。至此項高射砲之設置費。亦不過百萬至數百萬元耳。（價欵視砲口徑之大小及式類）又［一二八］之役。因我地面無高射砲。日機皆在白日出現而無忌。若有高射砲。則敵機不免乘夜攻襲。以避砲射。故此後高射砲之外。並須設置探照燈及聽音機。以資對付。兹可舉歐戰所留之敎訓以證明之。當大戰初期。德國飛艇飛機。每於白晝進攻英倫及其他之市鎭。迨英人設高射砲以擊之。德機受創。乃改於夜間來襲。英人又設探照燈及聽音機。以測探敵機之踪跡。一面對凖射擊之。又一面令自已之驅逐機。起飛上空。與之角戰。自經地面防禦設備較達完善之後。德機漸不敢再舉。夜間轟炸。至一九一八年春。則完全絶跡矣。故防空之設備。其價值殊不可輕視。歐戰時。防空之器械。尙屬草創。其成績已見如斯。况今日防空器之制造。更優於從前乎。（因此等器械之構造運用已大進步也）最近航空署特設高射確班。以造就防空人才。誠爲當務之急。我　人對於防空之觀念。向甚疎略。兹特舉防空所需之武器及其設備事項若干條於下。以昭示防空之範圍及其性質。</p>
<p>（一）高射砲之佈置安設及運用事項</p>
<p>（二）高射機關槍之設備及運用事項</p>
<p>（三）空際探照燈之佈置安設及運用事項</p>
<p>（四）航空聽音機及計算儀（以測敵機之距離及方向）之佈置安設及運用事項。</p>
<p>（五）地面防空之工事器械等對於上空之隱蔽僞裝事項。</p>
<p>（六）航空情報之傳佈（用電話旗語等方法）。空際外機來往之監視警聞傳報等各事項。</p>
<p>（七）防空隊之組織訓練事項。</p>
<p>（八）指導後方民衆應付天空攻擊之安全（如避毒避彈夜間滅燈之類）訓練事項。</p>
<p>觀上所舉—防空之應用武器及其運用事項。可知防空設備及訓練。並非簡單之事。而非一朝一夕所能猝辦者。倘不及早着手。則何以防來日之大難乎。吾人固從航空謀國防。而事勢上則必須兼籌並顧。蓋防空旣因航空而發生。則謀航空又不可不圖防空矣。</p>

<h3 id="c18">上海市中心區建設之起點與意義 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— 吳·鐵·城·</p>
<p>上海本爲一普通城市，因歷數十年長期之建設，以及無數人才苦心之經營，遂造成其今日重要之地位，今日之上海，非特已成吾國經濟文化之中心，且亦爲世界重要之商埠，輪軌輻輳，商賈雲集，全國貨物集散於此者，佔十之六七；而人口亦已增至三百十有餘萬，自國府奠都南京以來，因其爲長江之門户，東南之屏障，上海在政治，外交，軍事，經濟上之地位益形重要，故今日上海之繁榮與發展，實與整個民族之生存，以及國民之生計，有深鉅之關係。</p>
<p>惟吾人縱觀上海原有之設施，最初並無整個之設計，各處街道，均缺少有計畫之規定，今欲改善，已感困難，此後對於交通上之影響，將益不堪，以户口及商業而論，上海已爲全世界第五都市，輪航之來本市者，每年達數千萬噸，然無論大小船隻，抵埠以後，必須再歷一小時甚或數小時以上之路程，方得停泊，有時乘客，尚不得直接登陸，而各種貨物，尤不得小陸聯運之便，此種時間上與經濟上之損失，實爲世界各大商埠所罕有，亦爲上海今後發展，莫大之障碍。</p>
<p>故總理高瞻遠矚，早已於其所著實業計劃一書中，指陳上海改造之方針，總理之言曰··</p>
<p>［上海現在雖已成爲全中國最大之商港，然吳市長</p>
<p>苟長此不變，則無以適合於將來爲世界商港之需用與要求。</p>
<p>［任從何點觀察，上海皆爲殭死之港，然而在我之中國發展計畫，上海有特殊地位，於此審度之，上海仍可得一種救濟法也。</p>
<p>［我之設世界港於上海之計畫，卻仍留存現在自黄浦江口起至江心沙上游高橋河合流點止，已成之布置。······於是依我計畫，當更延長濬浦局所已成之水道，又擴張黄浦江右岸之彎曲部，由高橋河合流點，開一新河，直貫浦東，在龍華鐵路接近處上流第二轉灣起，塡至楊樹浦角，復與黄浦江正流會合，如此則由此點直到斜對楊樹浦之一點，江流直幾如繩，由此更以緩曲綫達於吳淞，此新河將約三十英方里之地　入，作爲市宅中心，且作成一新黄浦灘，而現在上海前面繚繞瀠洄之黄浦江，則塡塞之以作廣馬路，以及商店地。］</p>
<p>當民國十六年本市首任市長黄膺白先生就任之初，即遵循總理遺敎，確定全市區域及種種建設計晝，張伯璇先生繼任市長，仍循以往方針，努力進行，並於十六年十一月設立設計委員會，研究市政上之各種問題，又爲明瞭各市區之狀况起見，於十七年七月，率同各局局長，親至各市區視察，同時接收一部份市區，使直轄於市府，張岳軍市長繼任，又擇定翔殷路之北，淞滬路之東，閘殷路之南，爲建設市中心區之地點，十八年七月，公布市中心區域計劃，並設立市中心區建設委員會，又爲促進市中心區之發展繁熒起見，毅然主張在市中心區域，先築市政府房屋，以資提倡，並在本市發行第一次市政公債項下，指定的欵，以充經營市中心區域之用，十九年七月成立建築師辦事處，二十年五月開始招標，六月初正式開工，七月七日舉行市府新屋奠基典禮。　　故今日市府新屋落成，實皆歷任市長苦心擘劃，慘淡經營之功，鐵城今日樂觀其成，繼往，開來，實覺職責之彌重也。</p>
<p>誠以市府新屋之落成，僅爲市中心區建設之起點，而以大上海計劃之繁重與遠大，則此區區之建築，實僅爲滄海之一粟，惟吾人今日所應自信者，現在市中心區之地點，北近吳淞，南鄰租界，東濱黄浦，西接鐵路，交通便利，地點適中，中心一名，泃符其實，數年之後，其發展與繁榮，必可遠駕租界之上，此則我上海市民，所應取以自信，勇往直前，而努力從事於建設，促其發展者也。</p>
<p>晚近以來，國民精神上有一最大之病症，即爲民族自信心以及文化創造力之消失，羣趨頽唐，迷信歐化，而不知西方物質文明之眞諦，在物質之創造與改進，非在物質之享用與消費，以致衣，食，住，行，種種生活上之需要，舉非西洋物質，不能饜其慾望，鄙棄國焠，而終未有人肯運用其精力，以自謀改善，故上海近八十餘年來之發展，非但未能有裨於吾國民族文化絲毫之進展，而國民之習尙，民族之精神，反日趨墮落，無怪英國文豪，蕭伯納氏，一抵吾土，即深駭我國文化之已消失也。</p>
<p>夫國於大地，必有與立，一國國民，對於其自身生活上之需要，苟無創造之能力，實爲其民族生命上最大之危機，國人毋徒以依賴歐化爲樂，居住租界爲安，蓋勿一思其民族之危機，自振其創造文化之精神，自謀其生活狀態之改善，自闢其繁榮發展之園地，以自立其民族發展之基礎乎。</p>
<p>故上海市中心區之能否發展，並非單純一市之問題，實乃我整個中國民族能否創造文化，能否自立，生存，能否革除其因循依賴偷安享樂之劣性之試騐，而今日市府新屋之落成，小言之，固爲市中心區建設之起點，大上海計劃實施之初步，然自其大者遠者而言，實亦我中國民族固有創造文化能力之後興，以及獨立自强精神之表現也。</p>
<p>市政學家孟魯氏Ｍunro有言曰，［覺醒的市民，爲都市發展之原動力。］是則今後市中心之建設，大上海之發展，當尤有賴我市民之覺醒，願我市民，認識市中心區建設，深刻偉大之意義，努力合作，以竟全功，有厚望焉。</p>
<h3 id="c19">市政府新屋設計槪要 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>設計經過</p>
<p>本市市政府成立以來，附屬各處局辦公房屋，各自分立，散處於滬南及新西區一帶，文書傳遞旣費時日，市民往還尤感不便。本府有鑒於此，於民國十七年即有建築新市政府集各局處於一地以增進行政效率之議，並設立籌建市政府委員會，以資擘劃。自市中心區域劃定後，爲樞紐全市起見，該區核心，允宜爲行政　關之所在，是以市中心區域建設委員會成立之初，乃將籌建市政府委員會業務令其接辦，該會奉令之後，乃參酌各國行政區域材料，就本市政府及各局現狀，擬定設計之標準三項··一　新市政府立體式樣。應採用中國式。</p>
<p>二　新市政府平面佈置，應各局分立。三　新市政府建築步驟，應分期建造。　　根據上項規定標準，擬具懸奬徵求市政府圖案辦法，於十八年十月一日開始徵求，計前後國内中外建築家報名應徵者四十六人，二月十五日截止，二月十九日特聘評判顧問葉譽虎先生，前國都設計顧問茂菲氏，本市名工程師柏韻士氏，及市中心區建委會顧問董大酉君，根據評判標準，舉行審查，其評判標準如下··</p>
<p>［首須全部佈置，包括房屋四週道路河池橋拱等，均能十分相稱，次須各房屋外觀及點綴物，合本國建築式樣。再次須各房屋面積，與徵求辦法所規定之數，大致相符，並於分期建築附屬設備，均能顧慮週到］。</p>
<p>評判結果··第一名趙深，第二名巫振英，第三名費立伯，附奬李線沛及徐　堂施長剛二名。</p>
<p>據評判報告··本屆徵求所得圖案，難各具所長，惟最大缺點，厥爲計劃太散漫，各局距離太遠，不能收集中管理之效。應徵者同具之第二缺點，在未能充分運用中國固有建築式樣，惟此屆徵求之目的，原爲參考性質，並非求一最後計劃，故徵求結束以後，即由董大酉君於應徵所得第一奬第二奬第三奬三種圖案外，復擬就行政區域平面六種，由最後决定採用第一種。並於十九年四月九日，邀請應徵得奬人共同審查，先定行政區式樣。僉以第一種爲比較滿意，作爲新行政區域計劃之根據。同時根據選定行政區計畫，研究市政新屋式樣，取形北平宫殿建築參以現代需要，使美觀與實用兩全，計劃旣定，爰於十九年七月，設立建築師辦事處。根據决定行政區域及市政府新屋式樣，製就一切圖樣說明書，經市政會議通過，五月間招市政府新屋</p>
<p>標，結果由朱森記營造廠承造，六月間開工，七月七日舉行奠基禮，中間因一二八事變發生致停工約五個月，故改定二十二年十月落成。</p>
<p>行政區計劃簡略說明</p>
<p>邇來歐美各大城市多集公共機　於一處，名爲［行政區域］，非特辦事上便利，而聚各大建築物於一處，可使全市精華集中，增益觀瞻。上海市行政區計劃，即本此旨，行政區取十字形，位置在南北東西二大道之交點，占地約五百畝，市政府辦公房屋居中，八局房屋左右分列，市立大會塲圖書館博物院等及其他公共建築，均散佈於此十字形内，有河池橋拱等點綴其間，成爲全市模範區域。市政府之南，闢一廣場，占地約百二十畝，可容數萬人，爲閱兵或市民大會之用。兩大道交叉處建高塔一座，代表上海市中心點，登塔環顧，全市在目，從四路大道遥望可見，高塔　立雲際。廣塲之南爲長方地，引用現有河水，池之兩端，建立五重牌樓，代表行政區域，南門，池之兩旁，爲重要公共建築地位，市政府之東西兩端，有較小之長方池，池之極端，建立門樓，代表行政區域，東西門，池之兩旁，亦爲公共建築地位。</p>
<p>市政府及各局房屋，從南面望，全部在目，射影池中，增加景色，從北望，亦成正面，從東西望之，亦成整個　結物。平面佈置，除市政府外，可陸績添造，極合分期建築辦法。市政府之北，　中山紀念堂，興市政府摇對，，爲公衆聚會塲所，四週留空地，旣免父過擁擠，又可望見紀念堂全部，在各局房屋未完成之前，建造臨時辦公處兩座，位置在中山紀念堂之北，式樣簡略，將來可作他用。</p>
<h3 id="c20">市政府新屋簡略說明 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>市政府新屋之　計，　先决問題如左··</p>
<p>市政府曁各局房屋佈置鳥烏瞰圖</p>
<p>一　立體式樣應採用中國式。</p>
<p>二　平面佈置應各局分立。</p>
<p>立體式樣應採用中國式之理由··</p>
<p>一　市政府爲全市行政機關，中外觀瞻所擊，其建築格式，應代表中國文化，苟採用他國建築，何以崇國家之體制，而興僑旅之觀感。</p>
<p>二　建築式樣爲一國文化精神之所寄，故各國建築，皆有表示其國民性之特點。近來中國建築，侵有歐美之趨勢，應力加矯正，以盡提倡本國文化之責任，且市政府建築，採用中國格式，足示市民以矜式。</p>
<p>三　世界偉大之公共建築物，奚啻萬千，建築費用，以億兆計者，不知凡幾，即在本市亦不乏偉大之建築物，今以有限之經費，建築全市觀瞻所繫之市政府。苟不别樹一幟，殊難與本市建築物共立。</p>
<p>平面式樣應各局分立之理由··</p>
<p>一　中國建築，大都平矮，普通不過一二層，平面舖張，亦有限度，若過於高大，頓失中國建築格式，市政府及各局所需面積甚廣，若併爲一處，未免過於高大。</p>
<p>二　新關行政區域，係一片空野，亟應多建房屋，以資點綴，與在繁華市中建造政府房屋情形不同，故各機　不宜合併，與其極高大之建築孤立空地，不若多數較小建　，聯絡一處，合成一莊　偉大之南第。</p>
<p>三　原比經費文絀之時，市政府全部建　，非一朝一夕所可實現，不得不逐步建　。各局分立極合分期建築辦法，每次添增建築，不致牽動已成部分，兹將市政南新屋計資略述如左。</p>
<p>市政府房屋，居各局之首，爲全部主要建　物，自應較其他各局高大。然以辦事人數比較，則適相反，補救方法，將市政府公用之大禮堂圖書室大食堂等，併入市政府房屋内，使成爲全部最高大之建築物。</p>
<p>高建　中國建築，例皆平矮，過高即失其特點，且行政區地價尙廉，無上升高聳之必要，然亦不能過低而失其尊嚴。兹定爲四層，自外觀之，第一層爲平台，平台之上建二層宫殿式之房屋，最上層係利用屋頂，第一層及第三層爲辦公地位，第二層爲大禮堂圖書室及會議室，第四層係利用屋頂空處，作爲儲藏居住之用。全屋分中部及兩翼，中部較高大，因大禮堂平頂較高，須將全部提高，且市長高級職員辦公室均在中部，亦所以示中部之重要也。</p>
<p>長度　中國建築，因屋頂關係，平面不能遇大，遇必要時，祗能將數屋連接一處，今市政府新屋地盤甚大，爲遵守中國建築定例，將全部分爲三段，屋面亦分三部，房屋總長度定爲九十三公尺。</p>
<p>寬建　中國建築，例爲長方形，其寬度的爲長度之半，市政府新屋長連九十三公尺，應有相當之寬度。惟欲得充分光線，刻寬度又不宜過二十公尺，照此比例，房屋過似狹長，欲救此弊，惟有將全屋分爲三段，中部寬度，定爲二十五公尺，兩翼寬度，定爲二十公尺。</p>
<p>外表　梁柱式爲建築中之最古式，埃及希臘均爲梁柱式爲主體，而中國建築亦然，中國梁柱式之特點，在運用各種顔色裝飾梁柱等部，市政府外表即採用此式。第一層爲平台，圍以闌干，其上爲梁柱結構，屋頂蓋以緑色璃琉瓦，全部屋基九十餘公尺，未免太長，故將中部增高，使屋頂亦分三節，有巨梯自地面直達大禮堂，其下爲正門，車馬直達門前，前梯之兩旁，有巨獅坐守。</p>
<p>内部佈置　因經費限制，内部佈置注重實用，不事舖張，入口設在第一層，有前後及東西四門，有十字形之穿堂，聯接扶梯電梯各兩處，直達第四層，各層均備有厠所二處，第一層包括食堂廚房侍候室衣帽室保險庫及與外界有接觸之辦公室，第二層爲大禮堂圖　室及會議室等，與辦公室完全隔離，由地面有巨梯自外面直達大禮堂，旣屬便利，又壯瞻觀，第三層中部爲市長及高級職員辦公室，兩翼爲各科辦公室，四層係利用屋頂空隙，光線不甚充足，作爲公役儲藏擋案及電話機室之用，全屋分配如左。</p>
<p>地層　鍋爐間煤間伙夫間。</p>
<p>第一層　大門傳達處，警衛處，收發處，衣帽室侍候室，會計處，保險庫，庶務處，第一科辦公室，大食堂，廚房，電表室，公共電話室等。</p>
<p>第二層　大禮堂，圖書室，大小會客室等。</p>
<p>第三層　市長室，秘書參事技正等室，會計室，及第二，三，四，五科辦公室等。</p>
<p>第四層　擋案室，儲藏室，電話機室，臥室，僕役室等。</p>
<p>主要内部裝飾槪照中國式樣，梁柱槪漆顔色彩花，其餘諸室槪從簡略。</p>
<p>電氣設備　市政府爲行政機關，電氣設備至爲複難，兹分舉如後··</p>
<p>一　電燈　全部電綫均藏鋅镀之無縫鋼管中，所有管子均置牆内，總計電燈四五五只，電燈挿座百零一只，電燈開關三二一只。</p>
<p>二　電扇　電扇分牆風扇與吊風扇兩種，總計牆風扇一八只，吊風扇三一只，風扇開關一一九隻，廚房及備菜室裝有抽氣風扇各一。　三　電鈴　電鈴位置須依寫字臺而定，目前僅備出棧頭，依牆而行，裝在踏脚板内。</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>（市政府特刊）</p>
<p>四　電鐘　主要家中及穿堂裝置電鐘共有三十六隻，由母鐘主動。</p>
<p>五　電話　全部電話機件完全由市政府自行設備，僅向上海電話局借用對外中繼綫十條，内部設三百號，自動交換機一座，備有電話出綫頭八十根，所有設備均係德國最新式出品。</p>
<p>六　電梯　爲上下便利起見，備有電梯三只，電梯内部計四尺六寸長·三尺七寸寬，載重九百二十五磅（可容六七人），速度每分鐘行百五十尺。</p>
<p>熱汽管之設備　裝置熱汽管，費用頗巨，惟冬日禦寒，不能不有設備，現時市政府及各局用煤爐及電爐兩種，每年耗費甚鉅，爲永久節省計，似應裝置熱汽管，且其清潔與便利，尤非煤爐所可同日而語，爲免耗費起見，採用單管下降式，設鍋爐於地層，熱汽管面積爲九千方尺，屋内熱度在户外氣候三十度時，可熱至七十度。</p>
<p>衞生設備　衞生設備，包括大小便所，洗濯盆及冷熱水，所有器具，均爲最新式者，屋頂内裝儲水箱，其容積爲一千五百加崙，地室内裝熱水箱，其容　爲四百加崙，全屋抽水馬桶，凡三十四隻，小便池二十五隻，洗面盆三十一隻，洗灈盆三十五只，浴盆一只，冷熱水龍頭九十一只。</p>
<p>救火設備　每層扶梯附近裝救火龍頭一只，共計八只，牆上設備有七十五尺長三寸直徑之蛇管。</p>
<h3 id="c21">結論 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>歐美大城市建造市政府，不惜巨資，誠以政府房屋爲全市觀瞻所擊，爲公共建築之模範，其作用固不僅限辦公之用。惟際此國家多難之秋，經費支絀之時，不待不一切從簡，上海市政府新屋之設計，即懷比旨，除用鋼骨水泥作架外，一槪從最省辦法，如外牆及闌干用人造石，大禮堂大食堂及穿堂地面用缸磚，辦公室地面用人造地板，皆爲節省起見，果未能謂滿意也。</p>
<p>市政府房屋外，尙有各局，因經費有限，祇能逐年添建，目前在市政府附近建造各局臨時辦公房屋兩座，式樣材料從省，將來各局新屋完成，可以改作他用。</p>
<h3 id="c22">上海市中心區域計劃槪要 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>上海之地位，就　國言，已成爲最大之商埠；以世界言，亦佔有相當之位置。今後吾人如欲　謀其發展，非運用遠大之眼光，作審愼周詳之計劃，殊不足以應將來之需要。於此首應注意觀察者，厥爲　市市政之現狀，及此後發展之趨勢二端。</p>
<h3 id="c23">本市市政狀 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>今日之上海，所謂繁盛之區者，不過租界地耳。一入華界，雖與租界接壞處，稍改舊觀，而較遠之區，猶不脫昔時農村社會之狀態。此種畸形之發展，實爲本市市政最大之病象，試略言之··</p>
<p>一，租界横互於本市之中央，以致滬南與閘北一切設備，莫不劃而爲二，財力人功，均不經濟，而尤感困難者，則爲南北市交通上之聯絡。</p>
<p>二，租界當局歷年越界築路，計自前清光緒二十六年起，至民國十四年止在滬北者約十一里，在滬西者約一百六十五里，租界勢力日益擴大，則本市之障碍日甚。</p>
<p>三，滬寗滬杭甬兩路之總站，旣接近租界而船舶由吳淞入口，亦循黄浦而上，止於租界之濱，吳淞江又横貫租界之中央，水陸運輸實有助長租界發展之勢。</p>
<p>此猶就阻碍本市全體市政發展之各項原因　言也。至於上海租界之本身，其目前之缺點，亦有可得面而言者三··</p>
<p>一，上海現有之碼頭，大都與鐵路毫無聯絡，於貨物運輸，極不經濟，且因商務之發達，進口船舶噸位之增加，致使碼頭地位日益擁擠。多數海舶均須停於黄浦中流，或泊於江口，而用駁船運送貨物登岸，耗時傷財，莫此爲甚。　　二，居住於上海之人民，除却最少數外，生活上所最感困難者，莫遇於住居問題之解决。近年地價日貴，房租日增，自經濟衞生及種種方面觀之，均爲一極大之社會問題。</p>
<p>三，因近代交通器具之日益進步，而上海現有道路之寬度，日顯其窄狹。且因大多數道路之開闢，均遠在數十年前，以致毫無系統可言。至於分區，則上海史絶未實行。</p>
<h3 id="c24">將來發展趨勢 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>欲謀本市之發展，自常以收回租界爲根本辦法。就現在情勢論，收回租界僅爲時間問題。但收回之後。　在之租界否可以爲將來上海全市之　心，殊屬疑問。蓋本市地處要衝，區域大上海鳥烏瞰圖</p>
<p>遼闊，擘劉經營，自宜統籌全局，更須顧及日後之發展。一都市之發展，必有其所憑籍。以上海言，所以能有今日之發達，無非因其爲東亞唯一大港。故欲增進上海港口之地位，則吳淞開港，勢在必行。淞滬相隔僅十餘公里，將來兩部定可合而爲一。就現狀加以推測，苟吳淞開港有實現之望，而現有鐵路之布置，可以變更，則將來全市中心，實有由租界北遷之可能。查本市現在商業，均集中於公共租界之東南部分。法租界及滬西一帶，則大部分爲住宅區域。浦東方面，目前僅沿江略有碼頭，其餘大部分均爲農田。其地位與租界僅一江之隔，而地價之高下懸殊。將來交通方面，苟有圓滿解决辦法，則異日浦東之發展，誠未可限景··惟其地位性質，終不脫爲租界之附庸，無法逃其支配，故以爲未來之市中心，終有所未可。上海市政府有鑒於此，爰於民國十八年七月劃定翔殷路以北，閘殷路以南，淞滬路以東，及周南十圖衣五圖以西之土地，約六千畝，爲市中心區域。其重要理由，厥有數端··該處地勢適中，四周有寳山城，胡家莊，大塲，眞如，閘北，租界，及浦東等地環拱，隱然有控制全市之勢；劃爲市中心區域，可稱名實相符，一也。淞滬相隔僅十餘公里，該處介於其間，將來向南北兩方逐漸推展，聯接兩地而打成一片，樞紐全市之形勢，可期早日實現，二也。該處地勢平坦，村落稀少，可收平地建設之功，而　改造萬市區之煩，費用省而收效易，三也。該地果鄰黄浦，南近租界，水陸交通，均極便利，即在新商港，鐵路，未建設以前，亦可期相當發展，四也。由上觀之，爲適應將來之需要，與建設上之便利計，市中心之地點，以該區域最爲適宜，殊屬毫無可疑者矣。</p>
<h3 id="c25">交通分區計劃 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>市中心區域旣經擇定，在規劃進行之先，對於水先，對於水陸運輸，道　系統，分區規劃等，德同時兼籌並顧，以期整齊劃一，聯絡貫通，兹分述如次··</p>
<p>一，水陸運輸，本市水道方面，黄浦江實爲幹流。現時重要碼頭，均在租界或其附近一帶，惟將來商務發達，海舶日增，非建築大規模之港灣，不足以應需要，則未來之碼頭區域，其地位將在吳淞方面··而浦東沿岸之地點，則可爲商港擴充之用。而市中心五權路之東，虬江口沿浦一帶，更可儘先建築碼頭，最爲適當。目前内地運輸，大都取道吳淞江，將來市中心北移，則藴藻浜蔣爲内地運輸之樞紐··若能於相當地點開鑿運河，使與吳淞江聯絡一氣，轉運當益加便利。至若陸路方面，已成之鐵路幹線，一爲京滬線，以閘北之北站爲終點；一爲滬杭甬線，以南京之南站爲終點。此兩大幹線之間，則有自南站經龍華，徐家匯，梵王渡，至北站之聯絡綫。此外有淞滬支線，由北站起，經江灣，吳淞，而達砲臺灣。此本市鐵道線之現在情形也。論其佈置，不特無裨於本市之現狀，甚且妨碍將來之發展。其顯而易見者，如閘北方面因鐵道横互其間，至今市面凋落，無振興之可能。加以鐵道與水道碼頭相去甚遠，使水陸失其聯絡之資，亦非得計，故將來市中心向北遷移，現有上海之鐵道線，勢非略有改變不可，兹假定由眞如附近築一支線，北經大場　胡家莊之東，折東沿藴藻浜南岸，至吳淞一帶，與商港及虹江碼頭相啣接，更由眞如築一支線，經彭浦而抵江灣，爲未來之上海總站，則旅客及輕便貨物，可直接輸入市中心。北站之地位，仍可保存。滬杭甬之路線·亦如舊；惟自南站起，將路線延長，築橋渡浦，沿浦岸向北，　達高橋沙；則浦東方面之運輸，亦可因此更爲便利。</p>
<p>二。道路系統　關於市中心區域之道路系統，上海市中心區域建設委員會擬有圖說甚詳，可以參看。兹僅述其大要如次··</p>
<p>一曰建築接通商港鐵路，及各區之幹道，以利交通。此項道路大率寬度甚鉅，或接通未來之商港，或與將來之總車站相接，或與現在之租界及其他各市區聯絡，宛如星光之四射，而市中心則居其中央，有控制全局之勢。</p>
<p>二曰建築普通道路，以利商業與居住。此項道路之目的，在便利市中心，及其附近之商業與交通，並分劃建築段落，以利營造。現已計劃之路線，長約一百七十公里。其佈置，係横盤式與蛛網式並用，視四週幹道之正交或斜叉而定，終期劃成之段落，適於建築。又以本市房屋，因氣候關係，宜於南向，故將各段落之東西方向加長，以减少南北道路之數。此外對於與幹道平行之段落，亦儘量加長，以减少普通道路與幹道之交叉。</p>
<p>三曰設立園休運動塲，以利市民之衞生與休娱。爲市民衛生上及精神上修養起見，爰於市中心區域及附近，設置廣大之園林與空地，並力求互相聯絡之適宜，以點綴市容，而便游覽。</p>
<p>三·分區計劃　市中心區域道路系統旣經擬定，更應按建築物用途，劃分區域，使土地各盡其用。按上海市公佈之全市分區計劃，市中心及迤南至南市舊城廂一帶，爲商業區域；其北爲商港區域；其西爲住宅區域。然就市中心之性質而論，固官爲全市商業精華所萃，　考諸城市組織之通例，又應爲行政機關及重要公共建築所在。且在建設之初，市面未充分發達，地價未遽激漲之際，又不妨劃一部分爲建築住宅之用，以便該區市民就近卜居。兹將市中心區域分區計劃，略述如左··</p>
<p>政治區　凡行政機關及重要公共建築，宜設於城市之垓心，與形勢優勝之地，所以示莊嚴面興覩感也。市中心區域之中央部分，爲兩幹道之交叉點，又有園林點綴其間，最宜劃爲政治區域。市政府與附屬各局，市黨部，市參議會，圖書館，博物院，美術館等，皆宜建造於此。</p>
<p>商業區　市中心區域之北部，鄰近商港，並通客運總車站，將來商業之繁榮，可以預卜，爰劉一大部分爲商業區，以適應發展之趨勢。此外沿幹道一帶之地，交通紛繁，就此建築商店，旣利貿易，復可隔離後面之住宅區，使免塵囂之擾，故亦劃爲商業區。</p>
<p>住宅區　市中心區域及附近之地，除已劃爲政治區及商業區之部分外，餘均劃爲住宅區。住宅區復分爲甲乙兩種··甲種住宅區，係爲建築高等住宅之用，務求幽靜，故其地位在園林空地之近旁。又以此項住宅供求較少，故面積從小，乙種住宅區係爲建築普通住宅之用，供求較多，故面積亦從大。</p>
<h3 id="c26">實施計劉程序 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>本市政府於成立之初，即有以江灣一帶爲市中心，並開闢吳淞商港，改進市内鐵路之主張。經長時間調查研究之結果，乃於十八年七月提出第一百二十三次市政會議，議决劃定淞滬路以東，浦江以西之間，北至閘殷路，南至翔殷路，東至預定路線，西至淞滬路，爲市中心區域··並自决定之日起，停止該區内地産買賣過户。以上議决案，旋即提交本市建設討論委員會復議通過由市政府正式公布。並於是年八月，設立市中心區域建設委員會，主持市中心區域之設計事項。有於同年冬，邀請出席日本東京萬國工程會議之美國市政工程專家，龔詩基費立泊兩氏來滬，以備諮詢。現在市中心區域道路系統，以及全市分區交通等計劃，均已先後公布；並一度懸奬徵求新市政府建築圖案。此項圖樣，復經市中心區域委員會詳細設計，現已全部就緒，均已循序實施。在全體計劃中，最重要者，莫過於建設新商港，改進市内鐵路兩問題。蓋必待此二者解决，市中心區域之基礎，始能確立，全市之健全發展，始得拭目以待。關於建設新商港問題，正在延聘專家，妥擬計劃，庶與市中心區域之建設，同時實施，闢於改進市内鐵路問題，本市政府已將擬定計劃，於十九年七月間，咨送鐵道部核辦。至於市中心區域本身之建設問題，則按照工作計劃，正在進行中或已完成者，有左列各項··</p>
<p>一·開闢幹道　本市第一期幹道中，直接關係市中心區域者，有中山北路，其美路，三民路，五權路，淞滬路，水電路，閘殷路等。以上各路，或係新闙，或就舊路改良，皆已完竣。</p>
<p>二·建築新市政府房屋　市中心區域各項計劃，雖已漸次完竣，惟在各項計畫未見諸事實以前，深恐市民對於該區域内之投資，或將觀望不前，爰將市政府首先遷移，先聲　樹，將來各方聞風而至，定卜蔚然成觀。兹於市政府之五週紀念日舉行奠基典禮，此項工程，因一二八之事變略爲遲延，約在民國二十二年十月即可完成，是他日市中心區之形成，實以此市政府房屋之建築爲肇始，至若集市政府及各局於一處，增進辦事上之效率，猶其餘事耳。</p>
<p>三·招領土地　近年上海地價日貴，房租日增，大有寸土寸金之槪。自經濟衛生及種種方面觀之，均爲一極大之社會問題。市政府鑒於以上事實，有亟圖補救之必要，且因市中心計劃粗具規模，市政府房屋不久亦將落成，爲促進市面繁榮奬勵建築起見，乃有市中心區域招領土地辦法之規定，將市政府收用土地中最精華部分，以極低廉之價格，公布招領。第一次放領範圍北抵三民路，南至翔殷路，東至淞滬路，西至市中心行政區，全體約八百餘畝（詳見招領土地辦法）。其辦法業已於二十年六月一日由市政府公佈施行。現在並已繼續第二次放領三民路以北閘殷路以東一部分之土地矣。</p>
<p>四·建築深水碼頭　近來船舶噸位逐年加大，吃水深度已達十公尺以大上海總車站烏鳥瞰圖</p>
<p>上，現時上海所有碼頭之地位與設備，均不足應付此項巨輪之停泊。長此以往，上海航務設不迅謀改良，另闢新港與碼頭，勢必日趨衰落，可以斷言。除吳淞方面，江水旣深，岸線亦長，業已定爲新商港地位外尙有虬江口一帶，水勢較深，堪以建築碼頭。在吳淞商港計劃未實現以前，擬在該處先行建築新式碼頭，以應急需。（詳見虹江碼頭計劃書）　　五·建築黄浦江橋梁　按最近地産估價，公共租界南京路外灘之地價，每畝爲三十萬兩。其對岸之浦東，沿江之地每畝平均地價三千兩，再内則每畝僅二三百兩。所隔不過一江，而地價之懸殊若此，交通之重要，蓋可知矣。本市政府有鑒於此，是以有將鐵路由龍華附近，建橋渡江，延展至浦東之主張。本市第一期幹道内之浦東路，亦已興築，舍此以外，苟再於黄浦江土建築橋梁，則浦東一帶，勢將更形發展。爲增進市中心區域之地位計，築橋地點宜在甫中心附近　浦東方面之地價，其勢亦必因築橋即高漲，由此可用土地政策，以籌得建設費用之一部分。尤屬一舉兩得。　　六·建築道路溝渠及公園運動塲除幹道外·市中心區或内其餘之一部分道路·亦已於二十年度至二十三年度内，分别建築路面，排設下水溝渠，以利往行。又鑒於市内公園及運動塲之缺乏　並已就淞滬路翔殷路東北之空地，闢設公園及運動場，·便市民來此游憇，及舉行大規模連動會之用。</p>
<p>以上近述，爲建設市中心區域進行步驟之大槪，槪括言之，此項初步工作計劃，實包括開闢道路，建築新市政府房屋，同時遷車站，闢商港，更於黄浦江上築橋·以與浦東相聯絡。以上各點，誠能一一實現，則市中心區域之發展，不難指日而待矣。</p>
<h3 id="c27">建設經費來源 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>市政建設固不以營利爲目的　然苟能誘致工商業之進步，則市收入旣可增加，而社會經濟之發展，亦可因以促進·未始非一舉兩得之事。上述建設市中心開闢新商港及改進市内鐵路等計劃，如能一一見諸實行，上海市將來之發展，實不可以言語形容，則建設費用亦必有所取償，可斷言也，今假定第一期建設經費需欵五千萬元，其用途及預算如下··</p>
<p>收買土地　　二千萬元</p>
<p>新商港及碼頭第一期工程　一千萬元</p>
<p>總車站工程及添設軌道　　五百萬元</p>
<p>黄浦江橋樑　　　五百萬元</p>
<p>市政府及各局房屋第一期工程二百萬元</p>
<p>道路及溝渠工程　五百萬元</p>
<p>其他　　三百萬元</p>
<p>共計五千萬元（内第三項之五百萬　　墊欵性質萬元收回後仍可作他用）　　本市政府鑒　本市財政之困難，深知市政建設固屬重要，但市面凋敞若此。斷不能竭澤而漁，再在任何捐稅之增加。又鑒於辦理良好之市政，每可使其地之工商業繁盛，地價增高，故歐美各國辦理市政，有所謂土地政策者，其大意即不外乎在新市區未開闢之前，市政大上海商港</p>
<p>府按公平時價預購多數土地，旣可供他日建築道路公園之需，一旦市政發展，地價增高，復可將餘地出售，即以所得羨餘，爲繼續發展市政之用。上海市政府根據以上見地，爰於十八年八月公布市中心區域計劃之際，同時宣布按照當時之地價，收用該區域之土地約六千畝。將來黄浦江造橋及吳淞築港等計劃，倘能實現，則實行以前，必須繼續購進大宗土地。所有收用之土地，在全部建設未完竣之前，宜用租賃方法，徵收租權金及常年租賃金，爲公僨息金之擔保。租權金於取得租權時，一次繳足，不再發還，常年租賃金則按季分繳。至於承租商港岸線，或征收碼頭倉庫堆置等費，爲數皆屬可觀，可作爲第一期工程之預備費，儲存銀行，以資周轉。第一期工程完竣以後，土地價格必大漲，故於進行之先，應即估定新市區全部地價，以便征收地稅之施行；旣可補助建設經費之不足，並可以此爲繼續收買地畝之用；此乃發展市中心之根本問題，未可輕視者也</p>
<h3 id="c28">對各界之期望 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>市中心區域之計劃，雛型雖已粗具，將來全部計劃之能否順利實施，全視經費之有無。而經費之籌措，非中央恊助鉅欵，即須發行公債，公債之能否推銷，在於擔保品之是否確實，與將來利益之是否可恃。故本計劃書對於以上各點，不憚一再考慮　所望金融界企業界及各界人士，充分予以贊助，俾本計劃得底於成，不勝韾香盼禱之至矣</p>

<p>化學戰與毒瓦斯的防禦</p>
<p>— 實·</p>
<h3 id="c29">近代戰爭工具的進步 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>非戰的調子雖然唱得很高。和平主義者對於戰爭。不但表示壓棄。而且竭力反對。要使戰爭。——流血的戰爭不至於實現。然而事實上。從太平洋沿岸以至於大西洋沿岸。各國工廠的烟囱裏。都放出製造殺人武器的狂號。并且自鳴得意。以爲是戰勝了經濟恐慌。至少世界主要各國。都是準備着兩面政策。一方面是口唱和平。一面是全力備戰。在西歐是德國要求軍備平等。赤裸裸的讚美戰爭。在法國是力說安全保障。暗地裏却决定充實軍備。同時歐洲各小國。凡是能夠獨立的。都是在那裏擴張軍備。即小到幾乎不能自存。完全靠借債度日的奥大利和匈牙利。牠們國家預算。最大的支出還是在於軍費。東方的日本。就更不用講之。牠今年的軍事預算。占全日本國庫支出百分之三十六以上。而暗地裏借復興事業費。土木事業費等等。表面上是另一費用。實際却是一種軍事的建設。明年日本的軍事費預算。支出總額達十三萬萬日金。這樣龐大的數字。誰能說這不是得積極備戰。在實際行動上。資本主義諸國。固然是箭在弦上。大有引滿待發之勢。并且軍縮會議。四强公約等等。都不能阻止這一運動的進行。最多亦僅能緩和戰爭的時間。却不能消滅戰爭。或阻遏戰爭準備的發展。因此，社會主義的蘇聯。也要轉其五年計劃的機輪。以從事於軍　器悈的製造。雖說是防守的性質。可是國際間在未曾打開戰幕之前。没有一個人肯公然否定和平的。日本帝國主義者。那更是露骨的要在軍需工業動員之外。進一步準備産業動員了。</p>
<p>從前的戰爭。用戈矛刀劍時代。固然以個人的才力爲主。武器占次要地位。即是火器發明之後。集團的軍事行動。遂突過了個人的才力。而作戰就以集體爲主了。所以菲洲人的不怕死。回回人的勇敢。實際并不比任何一個歡洲人不如。其失敗的原因。是在於他們不會運用近代有組織的訓練。没有巨大的集體行動。所以近代的火器。也不能發揮牠所有的一切功能。現在輕重機關槍，大砲，等軍器。都非以集團來整個的運轉牠。不能表顯牠們新武器的功用。</p>
<p>新武器的進步。比上海的時髦還要轉變得快。而其爲純粹的消費。更是人造其知的事。可是多數人還是拚命的爭取勝利。集全力於軍事消費。所以一切的新發明。特别是機棧。電器的運用。在軍事上占優先的地位。兵工廠的擴大。在先進諸國固不用說。是集整個國家的力量來從事於軍用品的製作。産業比較落後的中國。如像四川，雲南，陜西，山西，等省。幾乎没有近代的産業組織。看不見烟囟的地方。牠們的兵工廠。都有上千的工人。在那裏日夜不息的工作。縱然牠們製造的武器。不足以和隣國角力。縱然牠們祗限於軍閥的劑據。可是用軍事工業來激動社會。來保持現時的地位。却是一樣的。現在備戰最急的國家如日本。牠不但兵工廠没有因市面衰落而衰落。并且一設工業。還因爲軍需工業的需要而活潑起來。</p>
<p>世界第一次大戰之前。軍器最主要的是鐵和煤。其次是火藥的原料。而軍事上最後决戰的兵種。在陸軍方面還是步兵。但是，現在這種平面的戰爭。已經轉化成立體戰爭。軍隊的行動。由人力的運動。轉而爲汽車火車坦克車的活躍。這還不算。因爲祇是地平面上的活動。僅僅是軍行速度的變化。根本上依然没有什麽特殊的顯著的差異。但是加上飛行機，飛行艇。就不同了。有了航空隊。不但偵探敵情上起了絶大的變化。即戰鬥的方法上。也有空前的變遷。同時因爲爆炸藥的發達。從飛機上慣炸彈下來。從飛機上機關槍的掃射。在大戰末期。漸次已顯其效能。近來尤其明白了。飛機擲彈。非僅限於前方。牠可以安然越過很嚴密的警戒線。跑幾千里路到後方法。大肆破壞工作。例如日蘇一日開戰。蘇聯的飛機。可以從海參威或伯力飛渡日本海而去轟炸東京大阪等重要都市。又如英蘇用兵。蘇聯飛機可以去破壞波斯和米索波塔密亞的油由和輛油管。</p>
<p>而且飛行隊的作用還不止如此。破壞用的武器。也不祗是炸彈一種。並用炸彈無論怎樣暴烈。其轟炸的範圍。到底有限。而一般社會躱避炸彈。也比較不難。不過飛機的轟炸。若盡情發揮。已經足使交戰國的社會。感到莫大的威脅。特别是人口密集的大都市。受影響更大。立體的空中戰。再進一步的發達。績飛時間加長。毒瓦斯的使用擴大。則戰區的延展。將至於交戰國家的全部。受戰爭直接威脅。遂不祇是前綫兵士。全體人民都一樣的入於戰爭的狀態中。特别是毒瓦斯使用的結果。會使重要的都市。走進毁滅的道上。化學戰的重要。遂爲全世界所注目。</p>
<h3 id="c30">毒瓦斯的使用及其種類 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>外傷武器的刀槍砲彈。沿用已久。大家都知道這些東西的作用。現在勿用多說了。只有内傷武器。似乎是最近纔有的。殊不知事實也是古已有之。例如古代利用風砂以困敵人。甚至以人工製造風砂。如用跑馬來激起灰塵。使敵方增加作戰的困難。我們中國在唐宋而後。每逢反亂的時候。或是官兵。或是反亂者方面。常常用辣椒及其他富有剌戟性的毒物來敎害聚集在一塊避亂的羣衆。以便刦取財物。又如前代的迷魂香之類。雖然不曾正式用之於戰爭。其爲毒物則了無疑義。不過那都是利用天然毒物。在十九世紀以後。科學漸趨發達。化學也跟着進步了。於是各種毒物繼續出現。如像　酸（CyanicacidHCNO）</p>
<p>和卡苛特爾（CacodyradicalAS（CH3）</p>
<p>）曾經有過使用於要塞的企圖。</p>
<p>因爲有了這樣的關係。所以一八九九年的海軍和平條約成立的時候。曾公約禁止有害性的毒瓦斯。然而一到利害衝突不可調和的時候。所謂條約就成了一無實用白紙上的黑字。一九一五年四月二十二日德國爲了要支持牠的勝利。就撕毁了海軍和平公約。大用其　氣。於是乎參戰各國互相競爭着使用優良的新發明的毒氣。當時在歐洲戰塲上使用過的毒瓦斯竟有三十多種。而在研究中認爲有相當作用時。合計在三百種以上。但是堪稱優秀可供使用而原料又不難採集的。不過以下數種而已。</p>
<p>一　光氣—PHOSGONE:Cocl2—一九　　一六年十二月開始使用。</p>
<p>二　重光氣—Diphosgene：CL-CO-Ccl3—一九一六年七月使用。</p>
<p>三　易卜勤物——又可呌芥氣——yperite:CH2CL-CH2-S-CH2.CH2CH2C1—一九一七年七月開始使用的。</p>
<p>四　氣化必克林—Chlopicrine:CC13No2在一九一七年五月開始用的。</p>
<p>五　　神二㷍（Diphenyechloroarsine;（C6H5）2ASCL）一九一七年九月開始使用。</p>
<p>六　精砷二㷍基（Diphenyecyanoarsina:（C6H5）2AS（CN）一九一八年六月開始使用。</p>
<p>七　二　化神乙烷基（Ethyldichlor</p>
<p>oarsine:C2H5—ASCI2）一九一八年四月開始使用。</p>
<p>此外還可以舉出很多種類的毒瓦斯。如葵氣之類。但都不很劇烈。所以從略。</p>
<p>如上述第一種光氣。比最初所用的　氣。其毒性大得多。除了使　發生咳嗽，嘔吐，頭痛之外。還會令人肺部破裂。呼吸困難。體温减低。這東西在尋常温度之下。是一種没有顔色的氣體。有特别難聞的泉味。所以呌牠作窒息性瓦斯。</p>
<p>第二種［重光氣］。很容易在陽光之下。因爲鐵或鉛的煤觸作用。而完成其分解。牠的毒性。雖較光氣爲弱。但很能夠持久。其破壞呼吸器官與先氣差不多。所以同是窒息性毒物。并且還帶得有催涙性質。</p>
<p>第三種易卜勝特。是在易卜爾打仗時纔開始用的。其毒性當其爲量微小的時候。作用很緩。常常要幾點鐘之後纔發作。又因爲牠是密度很大的液體。所以在毒瓦斯彈内噴出後。或爲氣體。或爲霧狀細粒。因此牠容易長留於地面上。天氣好的時候。可以留到十天。陰天竟能支持兩週。亦未可知。其毒性在最少時可以使皮膚生很深的瘡痕。會令人咳嗽。噴嚔，流涙。如果爲量稍大。就會使睛膜發赤。聲音變啞。皮膚起水泡。以至發生氣管炎肺炎。而至於死亡。所以這是窒息性。催涙性。及帶糜爛性的毒性。并且還有一點是難於治療。這是糜爛性瓦斯中最毒的東西。</p>
<p>第四種　化必克林。是一種無色的油狀液體。不易爲水所溶化。但加熱則有光氣分解出來。在瓦斯彈噴出的時候。或許就有一部分發生這種分解作用。這東西不單是有催淚性。而用兼具窒息性。</p>
<p>第五種鐘砷二㷍基。爲白色固體。在氣體中張力雖小。但是毒性非常劇烈。在空氣中其蛳在千萬分之一以下。即足以令人打噴嚏。如再增千萬分之一。即可令人嘔吐。設再增加即足致人於死。還有一點特别可怕的地方。星牠旣不溶化於水。　噴出時又爲細粒。所以防毒面具等。對這種東西的效力很小。所以牠的毒性比光氣還要更可怕。</p>
<p>第六種精神二㷍基。也是一種固體。在通常温度的時候。其張力很小。可是效力比　砷二㷍基大得多。假如每立方米突的空氣裏面含有○·○○○二五克的精砷二㷍基。即可令人在一爾分鐘内由噴嚏，流淚，而至於死亡。</p>
<p>第七種二　化砷乙　基。毒性雖然比較弱。可是製造很方便。原料也容易得。其剌激性且相當强烈。又還具有顯著的糜爛性。對於人畜的危害。幾乎和［易卜勒特］差不多。</p>
<p>上述這些毒物。都是十九世紀所發明的。不過在大戰當時。才搬到戰塲上使用就是了。至　製造的原料。如氯，如硫黄，如亞砷酸。如酒精。如本生油。如阿尼林，漂白粉。亞硝酸蘇打，亞硫酸瓦斯，　酸，硝酸，苛性蘇打，等等。都是普通化學工廠所常用的東西。　　在世界大戰期中。德法兩國使用毒瓦斯的數量。已經計劃着要占火藥用量的百分之二十五了。美國則準備着要用百分之四十的毒瓦斯。今後何如。我們還不曾曉得。可是當世各國之注重毒瓦斯。公開的秘密的設立化學研究所。組成化學戰隊。把很多的錢花到化學的研究。和毒物的製造　去。並且當世各　都把這種事情嚴密的秘密起來。所以牠們究竟每月能製出多少毒物。其毒性的力量有多大。我們都不容易完全明白。我們只曉得在大戰之後。美國每月能製造液體氯一千一百噸。氯化必克林一千五百噸。光氯一千六百噸。易卜勒特四千噸。合起來要制出毒氣八千二百噸。其爲害之酷烈。眞足以令人心悸。况且近幾年以來。化學戰備的進步。英美法日德各資本主義主要國家。以至另一方面的蘇聯。都聚精薈神。而且極其秘密地研究化學戰爭的工具。製造大量的毒瓦斯。一旦戰爭暴發。還不知要有多少人犧牲在這一類的毒物之下呢。</p>
<p>防禦毒瓦斯</p>
<p>我們固然不是謳歌戰爭。更不　是吹戰爭。甚至一般人的心理。特别是我們中國人的心理。大多數都是酷愛和平。希望相安無事的。然而現代社會。尤其是國際關係。縱然和平的呼聲很高。實際上還是以戰爭的準備運動爲最活潑最有力。所以我們對於戰爭的動向。不可忽視。對於戰爭用的工具。更不可不注意。那末最小限度。我們須知道危機臨頭。我們中國是躱不脫戰禍的。特别是沿江沿海的大城市。更加危險。所以我們對於毒瓦斯的運用。且把牠當作軍事上的問題。姑暫　不論。而於毒瓦斯的防禦。却要有普遍的訓練。然後纔不至臨雞着慌。纔能徐籌應付。</p>
<p>講到防禦毒瓦斯。最根本的事是先要認識毒瓦斯。換言之即是檢定毒瓦斯。這就是說儘力之所及的速度。趕快判斷敵方所使用毒瓦斯的種類。這種敎育。在德國　備得最週全。他作得有所謂敎育用瓦斯。又造得有檢查瓦斯用的火柴。於是一般民衆。都浸潤於化學業品之中。大家都習見。并且慣熟了瓦斯的臭氣和剌戟。一朝有事時時候。就有臨時應付的方法。日本近來也迭次作航空演習。毒瓦斯的演習。使一般人都具備防毒的常識。</p>
<p>毒死斯的消極防禦方法。大别約爲兩種。一種是各個防護。其一種是集團防禦。</p>
<p>各個防禦所用的方法。有防毒面具。防毒衣。獨立式呼吸器。集團防毒。是在一定的範圍中。或爲軍隊的防禦。或爲有毒地哉的消毒。</p>
<p>防毒面具的任務。是要敎人吸不曾含得有毒性的空氣。在防毒面具底下連帶得有一個吸氣袋子。在這個袋子當中。效置着中和劑吸收劑等。使毒瓦斯在這塊小小的地方。經過化學的吸收或物理的機悈吸收。吸收劑最通用的東西。是活性炭·蘇打灰·濾紙·等。使毒氣或霧狀細粒。都不能到達呼吸器官上去。所謂獨立式呼吸器。是和含得有毒物的空氣完全隔絶。該器具自已有足供呼吸的空氣或養氣。但是這祇能防禦窒息性或噴嚏性瓦斯。對於糜濫性瓦斯。則不能盡其防禦的責任。所以現在又另自有防禦毒瓦斯的防毒衣。那是用來防護全身的。使毒物鑽不到皮膚上去。這樣的防毒衣。是樹膠市油布等作成的。</p>
<p>至於集團防毒。是利用房屋。或地下建築物。作一種防毒的裝備。第一是在窗口·門口·都有極細密的裝置。使有毒的空氣。不能跑進去。再則在這些窗口上·門口上。都裝上毒瓦斯濾過器。可是一間屋子裏的空器容積。究竟有限。如若有多數人住在裏面的話。要長時問呼吸。到底是不行的。所以毒物防禦富一定要有一種獨立的裝置。以供給住在屋裏面的人的呼吸。</p>
<p>各種毒瓦斯的消毒劑。如窒息　瓦斯。則用次亞硫酸蘇打液。及阿爾加主液消毒。對催涙性和噴嚏性瓦斯。則用阿爾加主液。過酸記蘇打的酒精。對糜爛性瓦斯。則用阿爾加里液·漂白粉液。及溧白粉等等來消毒。</p>
<p>本文對毒瓦斯時認識和防禦。都祇作一種常識上的說明算可不是專門的研究。如果要專門研究。那是非看專門的著述不可。所以本篇即暫止於此。不再往下贅述了。</p>

<p>自全國經濟委員會發表相織棉業統制委員會宣言後、各方議論、莫衷一是、兹據該會紡織業委員發表談話如左、</p>
<p>棉業居吾國國民經濟重要地位、人所共知、不過從前棉的種植製造·運銷·都由個人自由經營、此種散漫的經濟組織、不但不足以適應現在的環境、且已暴　整個棉業崩潰的危險、是以全國經濟委員會有棉業統制委員會之組織、對於植棉·製造·運銷·諸項、均將擬定一種可能的具體計劃、逐步推行、以期達到帮助國家民族　供自給自謀經濟生存之目的、</p>
<p>從前關　植棉製造運銷·諸項、雖時聞個人或團體間有圖改進之呼聲、祇因意志行動不一、結果往往力微而効輕、現在旣有棉業統制委員會之組織、如植棉方面之改良棉種、推廣棉田、製造方面之製定工作·設備·雇傭·管理·訓練·簿計製品統計·等標凖·及擴增研究、敎育附屬工業等機關、運銷方面之減輕費用·便利運輸·靈通消息·穩定價值·調查産銷·呼應金融·減少投機等工作·均當由專家統盤籌算·詳訂計劃方案·分　急先後與各有關係方面合作實施、其他目前紡織工業之急救工作、亦在計劃之例、唯吾人雖擬以商業化工業化的精神、去計劃一切棉業事項、俾時間經費、不至浪費、事業方面、不至發生擾亂、或摧殘的惡果、不　目前我國國家地位、以及人力財力弱點很多、欲求速效、是不可能、是則有望各關係方面放遠目光、統一意志、一待計劃擬定、則以羣策羣力赴之、庶幾尺寸之效、總可逐漸收獲、否則及今不圖、居農工業第一位之棉業、倘一崩潰、國亡無日矣、</p>

<h3 id="e1">Children's Literature Collection <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Primary schools generally lack resources. A family library provides benefits and is a common practice in the modern world. Because the world relies entirely on the activities that children value, we hope they will consider becoming artistic and automatically developing their skills. This is indispensable. Source material, research, and school libraries should be integrated into the family, hoping for the extensive import of resources into a collection that children value, opening up opportunities for them. However, without offering art and lacking financial resources, how can we hope for the present? Fortunately, there is now a Children's Literature Collection. Not only primary school students but all have libraries... I hope for a peaceful world.</p>
<p>The association focuses on common libraries in families, preparing basic reading materials for diverse reference. It cannot be said that this is not a blessing for the nation and a focus on the future. September 30th of the 22nd year of the Republic...</p>
<h3 id="e2">Thoughts on the Publication of the Children's Literature Collection <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, elementary school textbooks, due to the efforts of authors and publishers, and the government's rigorous review, have gradually become standardized in content. However, the extracurricular materials for elementary school children are different. Old-fashioned novels, unsuitable for children's intellectual or emotional training, still hold sway. While there are occasional excellent works among recently published children's materials, most are hastily produced and lack a systematic approach. In terms of content, many resemble old-style storytelling. The role of extracurricular reading is to supplement regular classes and enhance their effectiveness. Currently, these types of materials not only fail to compensate for the shortcomings of textbooks and classrooms but also easily shake or diminish the accurate knowledge or proper ideas children gain from textbooks or classrooms. This is truly a serious issue facing elementary school education that requires significant effort from the publishing industry.</p>
<p>Now, colleagues at the Commercial Press have specially compiled a type of extracurricular reading for children, called the Children's Literature Collection. The number of volumes is considerable, and its scope can encompass literature, history, geography, and all sorts of common knowledge about the natural world. Whether original or translated, the authors are generally experts, aiming to replace the many poor-quality children's materials with beneficial alternatives. The extent of success of this endeavor, society will have its own correct evaluation, and I do not wish to offer arbitrary opinions. However, I hope that parents, elementary school teachers, and education experts will all pay close attention to such efforts, so that a serious problem currently facing elementary school education can be resolved perfectly at an early date. The Commercial Press's compilation and publication of the Children's Literature Collection is well-intentioned. At a time when the nation is facing difficulties, the fundamental way to save the country must start with elementary education. Therefore, since last year, the government has been eagerly seeking to carry out reforms such as innovating elementary school organization, establishing short-term elementary schools, promoting a two-part system for elementary schools, revising elementary school curricula, improving elementary school teaching materials, compiling and publishing elementary school textbooks, and enriching elementary school equipment, doing everything possible to make the content of elementary schools more practical. The compilation and publication of the Children's Literature Collection is very valuable in assisting this type of reform policy and, once published, it is deeply believed that it will be welcomed by society. However, there is something that must be approached with caution: Children's reading materials are of great importance to a child's entire life. It is less harmful for a child to have nothing to read than to read poor-quality books, as the harm caused by the latter will last a lifetime. During my tenure at the Ministry of Education, I once issued a catalog of extracurricular reading materials for children, but because of the extreme lack of children's books in China, the selection of books was extremely difficult. Now that the Children's Literature Collection is being compiled and published, those in charge have naturally paid attention to this point. I am adding this comment to encourage mutual effort. October 4th, 22nd year of the Republic.</p>

<p>Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Children's Welfare Committee</p>
<p>Today's children are the future masters of the country. If children do not receive sufficient guidance in their youth, they will be difficult to become healthy members of the country when they grow up. Therefore, the importance of children's education is recognized by all modern educators. Our country has long neglected children's education. Not to mention the children of poor families, who spend their days playing in the streets without receiving any education. Even affluent families often think they have fulfilled their responsibility by simply sending their children to school. Therefore, children in school often stick to a few textbooks and have no other supplementary reading materials available to them. This situation is partly due to society's neglect of children and partly due to the publishing industry's low output of supplementary reading materials for children. Now that the Commercial Press has compiled and published a "Children's Literature Collection," it can greatly make up for this regret. Including Jin Renlei, a small school or family can purchase a set for a limited cost, and the benefits for children are endless. I believe that the compilation and publication of this collection is truly a blessing for children, so I am introducing it.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Happiness of Modern Children <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Hu Shuyi</p>
<p>In the past - wanted to read but had no books to read</p>
<p>Now - not only can read books, but also have perfect systematic books to read</p>
<p>Compared to before, modern children are much happier in terms of easy access to reading materials. When we were young, unless we didn't want to read anything, we only had those vulgar, tiny-printed old novels available to us. The outdated views and crude illustrations in these books always made us feel dissatisfied. But what could we do in that era of "book famine" for children's literature? At that time, the only books that could be called true children's literature were the few translated and narrated by Mr. Sun Yuxiu, published by the Commercial Press. These books were naturally better and more interesting than those vulgar old novels in every way. However, due to the prevailing atmosphere, they could not have any great impact at that time. Nevertheless, Mr. Sun's pioneering work is undeniable, and the Commercial Press's ability to publish such books can also be said to have been prescient.</p>
<p>Since then, children's literature has been repeatedly promoted and has flourished greatly. Now, the number and variety of children's books are far greater than before. And the number of so-called "children's literature writers" is also increasing day by day. Bookstores compete to publish children's books as a tool for profit, so the quantity increases daily, but the quality declines. The shortcomings can be listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Not in line with children's psychology; (2) Cannot provide correct knowledge and awareness; (3) Focus on low-level interests; (4) Language organization is inappropriate.</p>
<p>The above four points, of course, each have their own reasons. For example, if children's literature writers think that children's literature is easy to write, or think that children's literature only needs to be humorous, then they will inevitably engage in crude production and abuse, or arbitrarily cut and change foreign reading materials, making them neither fish nor fowl. Or they will forcibly create jokes and deliberately insert "bloody heads," thinking that it is particularly interesting. In short, they are all misguided ideas and have no value. Regarding the tendency in children's literature to emphasize children's literature, the cause is also nothing more than the word "interest." Although those who advocate children's literature have their own arguments, believing that it is sufficient to develop children's emotions and imagination, and sufficient to enhance spiritual life, this is not necessarily the case. Anything that cannot provide correct knowledge and awareness, as well as rational reason, cannot be called good children's literature. The Commercial Press, aware of this, made a grand wish and created the Children's Literature Collection. This collection encompasses all subjects, is complete in categories, and is well-organized and methodical. At a time when children's books are of uneven quality and plentiful, the simple act of selecting books can provide many conveniences. And in terms of economics, because the entire plan is different from the scattered compilation and publication of books, it can naturally save a lot of money. Based on these two points alone, the Children's Literature Collection already has considerable value. Furthermore, examining its content reveals a great advantage, namely, the appropriate allocation of weight. Science and social sciences occupy the majority, while literature occupies the other third. This point can correct the current trend of general children's literature overemphasizing literature. In the area of natural sciences, animals, plants, minerals, physiology, hygiene, mechanics, and all other light crafts are very complete; in the area of social sciences, it includes history, geography, customs, civics, and other items; in the area of literature, famous Chinese and foreign works are also generally complete. In terms of scope, it is sufficient to meet the entire needs of elementary school students. Other aspects, such as simple language and eye-catching compilation, can enable children to read and understand at a glance, with absolutely no obscure or far-fetched problems. This point is sufficient to increase children's reading ability, and it is also helpful for children's writing. It can be said to be a win-win situation. As for the illustrations, they are rich and exquisite, which can also greatly enhance children's artistic taste, not only to assist in understanding the content. Such perfect and systematic children's literature is still a pioneering effort in the country. And at a time when general children's literature is being crudely produced, the publication of this book is especially meaningful. We should rejoice for modern children!</p>

<p>Wang Yunwu</p>
<p>I used to be the chief editor of the Complete Library, creating an entire resource for middle schools and general libraries. As a result, the number of libraries established due to this collection reached thousands. My efforts were not in vain. However, the need for libraries in schools is not limited to universities and middle schools. Even elementary schools need to have libraries.</p>
<p>Today, educators advocate for automatic education. I believe that a school must have at least three preparations to implement automatic education: (1) Arouse children's interest in reading books on their own; (2) Cultivate children's ability to read books on their own; (3) Collect various supplementary reading materials suitable for children. Among these three items, the collection of supplementary reading materials is especially important. Because without suitable books, it is difficult to arouse children's interest in reading, and there is no way to cultivate their ability to read.</p>
<p>Now, new-style schools, in addition to textbooks, must select various supplementary materials to enrich the content of each subject. Before class, students must read supplementary materials. When class begins, each person presents the special materials they have obtained for everyone to discuss. Since everyone has special contributions, the interest in the classroom naturally increases. Or, after class, students can search for supplementary materials in the library according to the teacher's instructions. It is no longer the case that everyone sticks to a textbook, which leads to the feeling that the lessons are dry and uninteresting. This is one of the reasons why elementary schools must have libraries, and it is also one of the reasons why supplementary reading materials for children urgently need to be compiled.</p>
<p>It is necessary to actively promote children's reading materials in terms of quantity, but special attention must be paid to quality. Because the books read in childhood most influence a person's lifelong aspirations and behavior. Children have a desire for knowledge but lack the ability to distinguish. Reading more good books creates good ideas; reading more useless books has a bad influence. The ideas formed by reading in childhood are difficult to change later.</p>
<p>Our libraries are filled with books, but few are suitable for children to read, especially for modern children. One reason is that our old works mostly discuss philosophy or major national policies, which are not suitable for children's knowledge. Another reason is that since elementary schools began teaching simplified Chinese, the old reading materials have deep vocabulary, which is not understandable by children. Moreover, many popular reading materials promote pornography or superstition. After children become literate, they seek interesting reading materials, just like hungry people seeking food, they are eager to choose anything, and therefore, there are many cases of planting bad seeds.</p>
<p>In order to provide literate children with appropriate spiritual food, we are engaged in the compilation of the Children's Literature Collection. Food must contain various nourishing elements to make the body healthy. Reading materials must also include various beneficial materials to promote the simultaneous development of knowledge, emotion, and will. This collection is based on this purpose, and therefore takes the prototype of the whole human knowledge as the scope. The first collection of 500 volumes includes 45 categories. From the perspective of library classification, the general category includes library science and book guides; the social sciences include social politics, international affairs, economy, industry, law, Boy Scouts, etc.; the natural sciences include arithmetic, astronomy, geography, physics, chemistry, reading materials, geology, biology, botany, zoology, etc.; the applied technologies include agriculture, industry, engineering, physiology, hygiene, etc.; the arts include labor, art, music, etc.; the literature includes Chinese language, mythology, fairy tales, fables, stories, proverbs, poems, plays, aesthetics, short stories, novels, etc.; the history and geography include history, geography, biography, history, etc. Among them, the two major categories of natural sciences and applied technology account for a total of one hundred and fifty-nine volumes, and the two major categories of language and literature account for a total of one hundred and sixty-six volumes, with little difference. In addition, the history and geography category accounts for one hundred and six volumes, which is also due to the lack of scientific knowledge and the error of historical and geographical vision among our people; therefore, special attention is paid to it. As for literature, of course, it occupies the largest number; however, the material is also particularly carefully selected, and while maintaining the need for children's imagination, we do not allow their intellect and will to be negatively affected. As for the compilation, in the area of natural sciences - especially physics, chemistry, industrial music, and engineering - because our children's opportunities for observation are far inferior to those of foreign children, what foreign children can understand in a word, we must explain in many ways to help them understand. In the area of literature, except for those that were originally very simple, all materials taken from old books are translated into vernacular Chinese to aid understanding; materials taken from foreign countries are also striving to be in line with national conditions. All other aspects are based on this purpose.</p>
<p>The purpose of compiling and printing this collection is the same as that of the Complete Library. On the one hand, it is to sell the entire library as a resource for elementary schools. On the other hand, it adopts economical and appropriate printing methods, so that elementary schools can obtain 500 supplementary reading materials most suitable for children's needs for a price of forty or fifty yuan, and establish the foundation of a library. Each of the forty-odd categories of the entire book is specially prepared with a cover, indicating the characteristics of each category, unconsciously cultivating the concept of scientific classification. At the same time, a number is printed on the cover of each book. Therefore, elementary schools that establish libraries with the "Children's Literature Collection" can be managed by elementary school students in rotation, without the need for a special person to preside over it. This is also a small effort we have made to save expenses for schools.</p>
<p>Finally, we must declare that the compilation of children's foreign objects in the country is still in the experimental stage. Although we are particularly careful in the editing of this collection, our colleagues' wishes are great, but their abilities are limited. Shortcomings in material selection and compilation are inevitable. We hope that domestic children's education experts will not hesitate to point out any errors. Those responsible for reading materials, their goal in selecting books, also shifts due to the personality of the child. This is certainly not contrary to the principle of personalized education, but the skewed infusion of one-sided knowledge is also not approved by educators. In order to avoid this drawback, we took the prototype of the entire human knowledge as the scope, and adopted all kinds of beneficial materials to compile and print a more systematic Children's Literature Collection as the spiritual food for children. This plan began in 1929, when Mr. Wang Yunwu formulated the categories and compiled the bibliography. After several revisions, it was handed over to colleagues at the Translation and Compilation Institute to be responsible for the compilation, and at the same time, commissioned domestic children's education experts, children's literature writers, literary writers, and experts in various fields to write articles. Thanks to the support of people from home and abroad, the manuscript was mostly completed by the winter of 1931, and many were arranged, and it was planned to start reservations when the spring semester of elementary schools started in 1932. Unfortunately, in 1932, the January 28th Incident occurred, causing the Children's Literature Collection to be published,</p>

<p>Today's educators all advocate for automatic education, encouraging children to read on their own, and all believe that children's supplementary reading materials are tools to achieve this goal. In order to meet this need, the Commercial Press first launched Children's World, and at the same time compiled and printed various children's supplementary reading materials, such as "Children's Literature Series," "Children's History and Geography Series," "Children's Art Series," "Children's Handicraft Series," and "Children's Science Series," etc. Since their publication, they have provided much convenience to families and schools; however, those who select often neglect one aspect or another. For example, this child likes to read literature, that child likes to read history and geography, and the person responsible for selecting</p>

<p>Also turned to ashes by the enemy's fire. In August of the same year, this museum resumed operations, and naturally had various plans for publishing books. Continuing to edit the Children's Literature Collection was also part of the plan. However, there were various difficulties at that time. First, the books and manuscripts that had been arranged before were completely burned. Second, because the entire Oriental Library was destroyed, the editor lacked important reference books during the editing process. Third, although the printing power was gradually restored, there were many books waiting to be arranged and printed after the destruction. It was not easy to spare the power of the important parts to deal with these hundreds of new books. However, for the sake of the future masters of all China—the children—we still overcame difficulties and continued to edit the collection, and with the support of many gentlemen at home and abroad, we wrote articles for this collection. Therefore, the plans and hopes of the past few years have finally been realized, which is what we are very happy about.</p>
<p>In the first collection of 500 volumes of the Children's Literature Collection, in addition to most of the new books, a small number of already published and quite valuable children's reading materials are also used. However, since this museum was affected by the January 28th Incident, all the children's books that had been stored were destroyed. It was absolutely impossible to use the old versions for reprinting, and there were many old books that were worth reprinting. It was urgent to choose the best for reprinting. Therefore, we made strict selections and obtained several types, and took this opportunity to carefully revise even the content of each book, even keeping its name but completely rewriting it, supplementing new materials, and re-drawing and supplementing the illustrations. Therefore, although some of the books in the collection have been published before, the content of each reprinted book is more complete than the original. As for the reading materials that have been popular in our country for a long time, such as "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Journey to the West," and "Water Margin," the parts that are not suitable for children's psychology and are not elegant have also been appropriately deleted, and punctuation has been added to all of them to make it easier for children to read.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that the knowledge needed by children is by no means fully included in the first collection of 500 books in this collection. If our ability allows, we hope that in the near future, we will continue to publish the first collection to the third collection to the...th collection. But our wish is great, and our ability is limited. There may be shortcomings in the materials taken and the compilation aspects of this first collection. We also hope that domestic children's education experts will not hesitate to advise us, so that we can have some guidance when continuing to publish the second collection. Fortunately!</p>

<h3 id="e13">Amidst the Advocacy of Planned Economy, the Current State of Economic Control in [Manchuria] <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>By Wu Qing Gan</p>
<p>Since the [September 18th] Incident, Japan has occupied the Northeast (Three Eastern Provinces) by force. Subsequently, it has been aggressively pursuing its economic aggression through political and economic power. The so-called argument for "[Japan-Manchuria Economic Control]" was immediately touted to the skies. As of now, the main industries and economic enterprises of the Eastern Provinces have all been under Japanese rule. We are now also strongly advocating for economic control, and with the recent establishment of the National Economic Commission, industrial control plans are also being implemented. However, I wonder what everyone thinks about the fact that the entire Northeast is being buried by "[Japan-Manchuria Economic Control]".</p>
<p>It has been less than two years since the slogan of "[Japan-Manchuria Economic Control]" was put forward, but the actual effects it has achieved are already quite alarming. Originally, Japan's goals for economic aggression in the Northeast were in the areas of transportation, industry, and trade. Now, let's examine the facts that have emerged in these areas.</p>
<p>X　　X　　　X　　　X　　　X　　　X</p>
<p>First, let's examine the transportation aspect. The South Manchuria Railway (SMR) in the Northeast already had enormous monopolistic power before the incident. After the incident, the SMR was used as the center to expand its control over the Northeast railway network. The Jihui Railway has already been completed. The Japanese themselves call this the first step in establishing Japan-Manchuria economy. (See the economic and political circles magazine published in Japan last month). In order to complete this step, they advocate large-scale immigration along the Jihui Railway, especially in the Jidun and Duntu areas, for easier development. Other railways in the Northeast have also been entrusted to the SMR for operation. In addition, the SMR is also building the Dunhua-Tumenjiang Railway, the Lafa-Harbin Railway, and the Taidong-Hailun three major lines under the name of SMR loans, with construction costs reaching 100 million yuan. Among them, the Tumenjiang overpass on the Duntu line reaches Unsong, Korea, which can further achieve the effect of "[Manchuria-Korea]" connection.</p>
<p>Among the railways in the Northeast, the Chinese Eastern Railway has Soviet interests, so Japan has always been helpless. However, since the end of June this year, Japan has begun negotiations to purchase it. Although it has not yet succeeded, with the simultaneous advancement of Japanese intimidation and inducements, it will probably be annexed by the SMR sooner or later.</p>
<p>In addition to railways, other transportation businesses in the Northeast have recently been completely monopolized by the Japanese. For example, after the "puppet state" was established, it established the so-called "[Manchuria]" Aviation Co., Ltd., jointly run by Japan and [Manchuria]. Most of its capital was contributed by the SMR Company and Sumitomo Bank. The line connects Japan's Tokyo-Dalian line and Russia's Moscow-Irkutsk line, and has now become a major artery of the Pan-Asian air route.</p>
<p>X　　　　X　　　X　　　X　　　X　　　X</p>
<p>Speaking of the industrial aspect, almost all of the important industries in the Northeast are now under the control of Japanese capital imperialism under the false name of joint [Japan-Manchuria] ventures. For example, in the operation of coal mines, in addition to the Fushun, Yantai, and Benxihu coal mines of the SMR, there is also the [Manchuria] Coal Mine Company, jointly run by Japan and [Manchuria], with a capital of 16 million yuan. The "puppet state" and the SMR each contribute half of the capital. The "puppet state" provides the Beipiao, Xi'an, and Heligang coal mines, as well as the Fuchou, Badaogou, Fuxin, and Xinqiu coal mines formerly belonging to the Northeast Mining Association are also under the control of the company. For example, the operation of gold mines is also controlled by the so-called [Manchuria Gold Mining Company], jointly run by Japan and [Manchuria]. All placer gold mines in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces are exploited by the company, with a capital of 12 million yuan. Most of the capital is invested by the SMR and the East Asia Development Company. The Northeast also has abundant alum mines. Recently, they have also been jointly excavated by Japan and [Manchuria]. Recently, the Northeast petroleum business has also been jointly operated by the "puppet state," the Kwantung Army Special Service Department, the South Manchuria Railway, and Japanese mainland capitalists, preparing to establish a refining factory.</p>
<p>In addition, other important industries, if not independently operated by Japan, use the false name of joint [Japan-Manchuria] ventures to achieve the effect of implementing control. For example, for the electric power business, there is the Manchuria Electric Power Company, jointly run by Japan and [Manchuria]. For the alcohol business, there is the Manchuria Alcohol Company, jointly run by Japan and [Manchuria]. These are the most prominent examples.</p>
<p>X　　X　　X　　X　　X　　X</p>
<p>Speaking of trade, Japan has completely controlled trade with the Northeast since the September 18th Incident. We can see the effect of its controlling trade in the Northeast from the rapid advancement of Japan's trade volume with the Northeast. It is already very significant.</p>
<p>First, let's examine Japan's exports to the Northeast. The status of the Northeast trade in Japan's foreign trade volume was 2.3% in 1931, 2.7% in 1932, and increased to 7.1% in the first quarter of this year. Just look at the following table.</p>
<p>First Quarter of 1933　　First Quarter of 1932</p>
<p>Thousands of Yuan　　　Thousands of Yuan</p>
<p>Japan's Exports to Northeast　15,402　　2,732</p>
<p>Northeast's Exports to Japan　48,953　　11,209</p>
<p>It can be seen that Japan's export trade to the Northeast has increased more than six times compared with the same period last year. At the same time, Japan's imported raw materials from the Northeast have also increased by more than four times. Among these Japanese goods shipped to the Northeast, flour, sugar, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, paper, steel, and machinery account for the most important items. Let's look at the following table to better understand the situation of Japanese loans advancing into the Northeast market in recent years.</p>
<p>Table of Japanese Goods Transported to [Manchuria]</p>
<p>First Quarter of 1931　First Quarter of 1932　First Quarter of 1933</p>
<p>Thousands of Yuan　　Thousands of Yuan　　Thousands of Yuan</p>
<p>Flour　　　389.6　　790.9　　1,483.9</p>
<p>Granulated Sugar　　96.8　　70.7　　　174.3</p>
<p>Seafood　　　3.3　　4.5　　　　15.5</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn　　　32.8　　98.5　　　　780.1</p>
<p>Paper　　　18.8　　11.0　　　　221.0</p>
<p>Iron Products　　　9.9　　16.7　　　　241.3</p>
<p>Machinery Tools　　11.4　　6.4　　　　585.7</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth　1,035.6　　381.4　　5,018.2</p>
<p>The most dramatic increase in the above table is cotton cloth. This shows the result of the "puppet state" setting up high tariff barriers in recent years to prevent the inflow of cotton cloth from mainland China. The original market of Chinese merchants has been replaced by Japanese merchants. These Japanese goods account for more than 90% of the total import trade in the "puppet state." It is conceivable how great its monopolistic power is.</p>
<p>Looking at the goods exported from the Northeast to Japan, most of them are naturally raw materials supplied to Japanese industry. In the first quarter of this year, soybeans accounted for 92.4% of the total exports from the Northeast to Japan, soybean cakes accounted for 81.5% of the total, kerosene accounted for 36%, and pig iron accounted for 89.0%. Their increased exports are shown in the following table.</p>
<p>Table of [Manchuria] Goods Transported to Japan</p>
<p>First Quarter of 1931　First Quarter of 1932　First Quarter of 1933</p>
<p>Thousands of Yuan　　Thousands of Yuan　　Thousands of Yuan</p>
<p>Soybeans　　2,869.7　　5,921.9　16,698.0</p>
<p>Kerosene　　207.1　　　375.2　2,741.1</p>
<p>Coal　　59.7　　4.0　4,562.3</p>
<p>Pig Iron　　　———　　———　6,149.0</p>
<p>Soybean Cakes　6,665.5　　5,406.2　14,147.7</p>
<p>Who controls the export of these important raw materials from the Northeast? Needless to say, it is completely controlled by several major import and export firms such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Nisshin (?) in Japan. According to the Japanese "Manchuria Economic Communication," Mitsui &amp; Co. handled the shipment of 1,346 tons of soybeans from the Northeast to Europe in January of last year. During the same period this year, it has increased to 39,082 tons. It can be seen that the activities of the Volunteer Army have stopped, and the situation in the "puppet state" has stabilized. The purpose of Japanese economic aggression has also been successfully achieved step by step.</p>
<p>X　　X　　X　　X　　X　　X</p>
<p>However, Japan's ambition for economic control in the Northeast is more than that. Generally, people who embrace economic aggression only hope that Japan's entire food, clothing, and housing problems can be solved by the method of Japan-Manchuria economic control, while those who harbor dreams of armed conquest only regard this economic control strategy as a tool for subduing the colony. When the time is right, the so-called [economic control] will become a synonym for [political annexation]. Our authorities are now studying the [national] economic control plan. I don't know if [Northeast] and [Rehe] are also included in the scope of this [national] economic control. Therefore, I briefly describe the current situation of Japan's economic control in the Northeast in order to arouse the deep legal awareness of the people.</p>

<p>— Lin, Wo, Jiang</p>
<p>Since the beginning of history, due to the inventions of science, the evolution and application have influenced the lives of all people. The most notable of these are electricity and aviation. However, while the effectiveness of electricity is certainly widespread, even today it must give way to the rising aviation industry, which has taken the top position. The invention and utilization of electricity dates back over seventy years, and its history has already become a thing of the past. Airplanes, on the other hand, from invention to testing and application, is only a matter of the last thirty years. Nevertheless, world culture has undergone tremendous changes because of it, especially in military affairs and transportation. Moreover, in recent years, the technology and industry of aviation have advanced by leaps and bounds. Because of the performance and utility it demonstrates, the future of aviation is immeasurable. Those who previously relied on perfect naval and land forces to dominate the world are almost losing their basis. Even those who depended on automobiles and ships as the lifeline of transportation are feeling their slowness and inconvenience. Since the European War, the great powers have been competing to develop military and civilian aviation, considering it a strategy for national survival. There are good reasons for this.</p>
<p>When Hu Linyi was besieging Anqing, he remained unmoved in the face of a powerful enemy. However, when he saw foreign steamships sailing on the river, he was alarmed. He anticipated that China's troubles would not come from the Taiping Army, but from foreigners using newly invented weapons to invade our country. Indeed, since the Opium War eighty years ago, what the great powers have used to threaten our country has been nothing but their invented cannons, battleships, and new weapons. After suffering oppression, the government and people of our country gradually realized the need for coastal defense and began to pay attention to naval construction and the deployment of coastal batteries. Unfortunately, the efforts were weak, and what is called coastal defense today is nothing more than a few dozen old warships and some abandoned fortresses, not enough to be called defense. Moreover, every era has its own important national defense. In the past, emphasis was placed on the army, and then, in response to the needs of the times, the navy was built for national defense. Today, due to the spiritual transformation brought about by science, there is a trend towards the construction of air forces. Without an air force, there can be no national defense. This is also an inevitable trend of the times. Therefore, when we see airplanes soaring in the sky today, how can we not be as startled as Hu Linyi and know where the great disaster of the future lies? Furthermore, according to the facts, the great powers have twice used air power to threaten and ravage our country, killing our compatriots. During the Sino-Soviet conflict over the Middle East Railway in the 18th year of the Republic [1929], Soviet Russia used its air force to encroach upon our borders. Following this were the [September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident)] and [January 28th Incident (Shanghai Incident)] incidents, in which the Japanese air force invaded Northeast China and the Yangtze River basin. Even now, Japanese planes still appear from time to time over North China. Readers, upon seeing this, must sigh and feel their chests filled with worry and indignation, lamenting the weakness of our country's air force, which is insufficient to resist insults, while the violent neighbors can launch air strikes at any time to control our lives. The *Shen Bao* [Shanghai News] usually publishes a special issue on Double Ten Day [October 10th]. In this time of national crisis, it is proposed to discuss the aviation industry, hoping to make the people understand the state of our country's aviation and the relationship between aviation and national defense. I was asked to contribute an article, so I will briefly describe the past and present of our country's aviation, as well as the matters that I believe our country should pay attention to in the future development of aviation, and offer them to the readers.</p>
<p>The Early History of China's Aviation Industry</p>
<p>It was three years before the founding of the Republic [1909, the first year of the Xuantong era] that Mr. René Vallon, a French aviator, brought a Sommer biplane to China and performed aviation demonstrations in Shanghai. Later, during a trial performance, the plane crashed, and he lost his life. Today, there is a road in the French Concession named Vallon, which is how the French commemorate this aviator. This means that the Chinese people knew what an airplane was as early as twenty-five years ago. During the Xinhai Revolution, the revolutionary army planned to use airplanes to capture Beijing, so they ordered two Etrich Taube monoplanes from Austria for this purpose. By the time the airplanes were shipped to Shanghai, the peace agreement had been reached, and the North and South were unified. The airplanes were then transported to Nanyuan [Southern Hunting Park] in Beijing. The General Staff Headquarters opened an aviation school in Nanyuan and acquired twelve Caudron biplanes for the purpose of training flight personnel. It also established an airfield and a repair factory. This means that the Chinese people knew about using airplanes and planning to train flight personnel as early as twenty-two years ago. Since then, the authorities have gradually paid attention to airplane manufacturing, commercial aviation, and aviation administration. Therefore, the Ministry of the Navy established a school and a manufacturing plant in Mawei in the fifth year of the Republic [1916]. In the eighth year of the Republic [1919], the State Council and the Ministry of Communications successively established aviation affairs offices to implement their plans. In the winter of the ninth year [1920], the two offices were merged. In February of the tenth year [1921], they were expanded into the Aviation Bureau, which took charge of all aviation matters nationwide. It was the highest aviation administrative organ.</p>
<p>At that time (i.e., the tenth year of the Republic [1921]), the Aviation Bureau was placed under the State Council, with a Director-General, a Bureau Chief, two counselors, four department heads, and several secretaries, clerks, technical experts, and principal officers. Its organization included a General Affairs Office and four departments: Military Affairs, Machinery, Shipping, and Management. The Office was divided into four sections, and each department had three sections. Judging from its heavy structure, it was clearly a pure bureaucracy rather than an organization for starting a business. Aside from planning several aviation routes (at that time, there were plans for five major routes, twelve secondary routes, and eight branch routes), establishing some aviation regulations, and purchasing some airplanes, there were no significant achievements. When the Zhili-Anhui War broke out, most of the airplanes were transported to the three eastern provinces [Manchuria]. After the Fengtian Army acquired the airplanes, it established the Three Eastern Provinces Aviation Office in Shenyang in the spring of the eleventh year [1922]. The Beijing Aviation Bureau's planned Beijing-Shanghai airline (Beijing-Tianjin-Jinan-Xuzhou-Nanjing-Shanghai) became nothing more than a pie in the sky.</p>
<p>Recent Central Government Military Aviation Facilities: An Overview</p>
<p>In the fifteenth year of the Republic [1926], the Northern Expeditionary Army rose up. The airplane squadron of the Aviation Bureau in Guangdong set out with the army for Hunan and Hubei. In the autumn of that year, after Wuhan was captured, the capital was established in Nanjing. An Aviation Office was established in the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters, with Zhang Jingyu appointed as the Director of the Aviation Office and Commander of the Northern Expeditionary Aviation Team. It collected a dozen airplanes from the Eastern Route and Jiangyou armies and organized them into two squadrons, subordinate to the Military Affairs Commission. In the spring of the seventeenth year [1928], the second Northern Expedition was launched, and the aviation squadrons were reorganized into an Aviation Group and set out for Jinpu. By the winter of that year, the Northern Expedition was completed, and the Military Affairs Commission was abolished. The Ministry of Military Administration was established, and the central government's aviation industry was managed by the Aviation Bureau under the Ministry of Military Administration. At that time, there were no aviation organizations in the north except for the Liaoning Aviation Office.</p>
<p>After the Aviation Bureau was established in Nanjing in the seventeenth year [1928], Zhang Huichang was appointed as the Bureau Chief and Huang Bingheng as the Deputy Bureau Chief. Its organization was simpler than the Aviation Bureau of the former Beijing government era. It had a Bureau Chief, a Deputy Bureau Chief, and six sections: Documentation, Administration, Military Affairs, Aviation Affairs, Education, and Machinery. After the administrative organization was finalized, it began to organize the air squadrons. Previously, the number of airplanes in each air squadron varied greatly, but they were gradually unified to form five squadrons. Each squadron had three sub-squadrons, and staff members were added for staff, mechanical engineers, wireless telegraph teams, and photography and mapping. By the nineteenth year [1930], the number of air squadrons had increased to seven, and the organization of the cover squadrons was expanded. Aviation factories were also established one after another. Because of the perceived importance of training personnel, an aviation school was established in the capital. This is an overview of the central military aviation organization and progress since the Northern Expedition until the January 28th Incident [Shanghai Incident, 1932]. In the most recent year, in response to the needs of the times, there have been many changes in the organization and facilities of the Aviation Bureau. In terms of the administrative system, as mentioned earlier, the Aviation Bureau was previously under the Ministry of Military Administration, but last month it was ordered to be transferred to the Military Affairs Commission. Its organizational regulations have also been reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. Since the aviation school was moved from Nanjing to Hangzhou, its scale has also been changing rapidly. The aim is to cultivate aviation talent with relatively complete facilities and skilled instructors. Therefore, in addition to recruiting students for the flight department every year, there are also machine and hangar departments and other technical instruction (such as aerial photography and wireless radio). This also shows that our country's authorities have a deep understanding of the aviation industry and attach importance to cultivating flight and manufacturing talent as the foundation for building an air force in the future. Recently, the Aviation Bureau has also established an anti-aircraft artillery class in Hangzhou to train ground-to-air personnel and recruited students and trainees. The examination was held in Beijing on the 5th of this month. The planning of factories for self-manufacturing airplanes and the organization and training of various air squadrons are also underway. All of these things require huge expenses, and it is not easy to raise funds in this time of financial difficulty. The government has been able to make sacrifices and strive for improvement, which is a new starting point for our country's national defense. If the whole country can be united and work together to make continuous progress, the construction of our country's air force is not impossible. The above is a general overview of what can be said about the central government's military aviation. Details cannot be disclosed at will. However, today, the difficulties in developing military aviation in our country are not limited to finances. The lack of unified aviation administration is also a miscalculation. Currently, the limited air force in our country, in addition to being subordinate to the central government for command, training, and direction, also includes the air forces of Guangdong and Guangxi, which have their own command headquarters and aviation schools. There are more than a hundred airplanes. There are also independent air forces in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Fujian, which, although numbering only a few dozen, are managed separately. Each has its own plans and raises funds locally to implement them. This phenomenon not only leads to uneconomical situations, but it is also not the way to increase the efficiency of air defense. Other countries do not have this precedent. The advantages and disadvantages will be discussed in detail later in this article. An Overview of the Central Government's Commercial Aviation Facilities in Recent Years</p>
<p>After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it not only made considerable facilities for military aviation, but also successively organized commercial aviation. The airline planned but not built by the former Beijing government has seen a partial realization. First, in the eighteenth year of the Republic [1929], Sun Ke, the Minister of Railways, signed a contract with the American Aviation Development Corporation to jointly operate China's shipping business. Later, due to certain reasons, both parties agreed to cancel the contract, and commercial aviation was placed under the management of the Ministry of Communications. In the nineteenth year [1930], Wang Boqun, the Minister of Communications, signed a contract with the American Flying Transport Company. The two parties jointly invested in the China Aviation Corporation with a capital of ten million yuan. The Chinese side contributed 55%, and the American side contributed 45%. The National Government promulgated the company's management and supervision regulations. Under the supervision of the Ministry of Communications, a board of directors was established with five members, three Chinese and two American. Under the board of directors, there were three groups: business, finance, and aviation. The power of the business and finance groups was mostly controlled by the Chinese side. Regarding the company's operations, three air mail routes were established at that time: (1) the Shanghai-Chengdu route, passing through Nanjing, Jiujiang, Hankou, Yichang, Wanxian, and Chongqing; (2) the Nanjing-Beiping route, passing through Xuzhou, Jinan, and Tianjin; and (3) the Shanghai-Guangzhou route, passing through Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou. After the company was established, it first operated the Shanghai-Hankou airline, then the Beijing-Beiping route, and recently the Shanghai-Guangzhou route. However, it has not yet been scheduled to open. Its business scope includes mail transportation, passenger transportation, and freight transportation.</p>
<p>The organization of the company is roughly as described above. As for the company's origins and nature, the China Aviation Corporation published a special commemorative issue when the Beijing-Beiping and Hankou lines opened successfully the year before last [1931]. A passage from it is sufficient to clarify the significance of this. It is specifically recorded to show the current policy adopted by our country for jointly operating commercial aviation with foreigners. After the Sino-American cooperation, the Sino-German cooperative Eurasian Aviation Corporation (now extended to Dihua) is also generally operated according to this principle. The text of the special issue is as follows: [Although our country's aviation industry was established and operated by the government in the past, it stopped and started due to continuous wars in the country and failed to achieve results. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, in view of the importance of air defense in the world and the development of air transport, it took the spirit of "catching up" advocated by the Prime Minister and spared no effort to strengthen military aviation. However, for the convenience of travelers, the speed of mail, the communication of industry and commerce, and the development of culture, the operation of commercial aviation cannot be delayed. Therefore, after consulting with others, the government decided to organize the China Aviation Corporation in the spring of the eighteenth year [1929] and specially appointed Minister Sun Zhesheng as the chairman to sign an air transportation and air mail contract with the American Development Corporation. All three routes of Shanghai-Hankou, Beijing-Beiping and Shanghai-Guangzhou were included. Later, the Aviation Development Corporation assigned its rights to the Flying Transport Company of the same nationality. In November, the Shanghai-Hankou line began to fly. Subsequently, due to changing circumstances, changes were made again. Minister Sun resigned from his original work and retreated to observe the success, while the government took advantage of the situation and weighed the system, and then Wang Boqun succeeded him as Minister. After several discussions, it was finally changed to be jointly operated by China and the United States, and the Shanghai-Chengdu Aviation Office originally established by the Ministry of Communications was merged into one, thus forming today's China Aviation Corporation with different names but the same substance. Summarizing the results of the succession, in terms of shares, our side accounts for the majority, and there is no fear of manipulation. In terms of personnel, the chairman and general manager belong to us, and the number of directors is also relatively large. There is no fear of being overshadowed in the meeting. However, due to the initial stage of aviation, in addition to recruiting domestic experts, talents from other countries may be borrowed from time to time, which is also in line with the spirit of the Prime Minister's industrial plan. Other aspects such as the basis of national law, the compliance with national language, the discounting of advances, and the sharing of benefits are all based on sovereignty and equality. Compared with the previous one-sided losses of our country's joint ventures with international companies, how different are they?] Readers can also understand the outline from this.</p>
<p>In addition to signing a contract with the United States to jointly operate aviation mail, the Ministry of Communications also signed a contract with the German Lufthansa. The conditions are also roughly the same as the China Aviation Corporation's joint operation, but the capital is only three million, with the Chinese side contributing two-thirds and the German side one-third. The Eurasian Aviation Corporation was established and plans to operate the following three lines:</p>
<p>(1) From Shanghai to Europe via Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, and Manchuria, the Russian border (with Berlin as the endpoint).</p>
<p>(2) From Shanghai to Europe via Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, and the Chinese border outside Kulun, connecting to the Russian border.</p>
<p>(3) From Shanghai to Europe via Nanjing, Gansu, and the Chinese border of Xinjiang, connecting to the Russian border.</p>
<p>The route operated by the Eurasian Aviation Corporation is more difficult than the China Aviation Corporation, because most of the route passes through desolate areas, and there are no airfields or landing places. It is extremely inconvenient to replenish fuel or repair aircraft along the way. Since the January 28th Incident [Shanghai Incident, 1932], the first two lines must pass through the territory of the puppet state [Manchukuo], so they were not operated. At present, the only successful test flight and scheduled flight is the third line that was planned, which can only reach Dihua [Ürümqi]. This line starts from Shanghai, passes through Nanjing, Luoyang, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Suzhou, Hami, and Dihua, and is 3,515 kilometers long. The flight time is only two and a half days. It is the most important and agile means of transportation between our country and the northwestern border, which is very important for national defense and culture. In addition, Mr. Li Jingzong, the general manager of the company, has repeatedly inspected the route during the test flights, regardless of the difficulties. We hope that in the near future, regular air mail between Eurasia will be realized. (According to the Eurasian airline, the test flight was successful in July of this year. When the company's plane took off from Berlin and arrived in Shanghai, the author welcomed it at Hongqiao Airport.) What used to take more than a month for travel or mailing now takes only three or four days. Moreover, today, the regular airlines that have been implemented in our country are all domestic flights. Only by connecting Eurasia and connecting it can it become an international flight, which can be beneficial to culture, economy, and national defense.</p>
<p>Ways to Develop Aviation in Our Country</p>
<p>The above is a brief description of the process of establishing aviation in our country and the current situation, so that those who are interested in aviation in our country can understand the gains and losses of the past. Today, our country's military aviation and commercial aviation are still far from the standards of consolidating national defense and facilitating transportation, and there is a need for everyone to work together to engage in aviation construction. The following points are based on the paths taken by various countries in the world to develop aviation, or based on the actual needs of our country, and selected for discussion, hoping to make the people have some understanding of the several fundamental issues of aviation construction. Today, when talking about national defense, we cannot rely solely on the government. Everyone must have the determination to work together to fight against the enemy and the spirit of sacrificing wealth and life. Then we can talk about building aviation and consolidating national defense. A famous European general said, [National defense does not rely entirely on the dangers of mountains, rivers, and seas. The construction of national defense must be in the psychology of the people.] That is the meaning. Moreover, today, due to the invention of aviation and the activities of the air force, once war breaks out, regardless of troops or civilians, everyone has the responsibility of guarding and defending and is directly affected by the war. There is no longer a distinction between troops and civilians on the front line and the rear in wartime as in the past. Wherever enemy planes can reach, all the horrors of war can be staged at any time and anywhere. During the January 28th Incident [Shanghai Incident, 1932], the front line was indeed in the vicinity of Shanghai, but enemy planes repeatedly flew over Suzhou and Hangzhou in squadrons to bomb our airfields. When they reached Suzhou, they flew low over the city and strafed it with machine guns, killing dozens of men, women, and children. Today, the endurance of fighters and bombers has gradually increased, and enemy planes can easily fly into the hinterland within a thousand miles of our country's borders or the coast to destroy our political, industrial, commercial, and transportation centers. What we rely on to resist the enemy is only the air force and ground-to-air weapons (i.e., anti-aircraft artillery, searchlights, etc.). Therefore, today, when talking about national defense, aviation is the most important. To develop aviation, it is necessary for society to observe the situation and create public opinion, promote the aviation national defense movement, and urge and support the government to speed up its construction. Today, the aviation national salvation movement is tantamount to a national self-salvation movement.</p>
<p>(1) Establishing Aviation Policy Every country must have a certain policy for building aviation, that is, to decide whether its air force should take an offensive or defensive stance. Prepare to meet the standards of combat effectiveness of one country, or the standards of two or more countries. It is also necessary to identify which country or countries are the hypothetical enemy in the present. Observe the state of its air force as a target for preparation. Considering our country's national conditions, the first step in the preparation of our air force is to defend the territory. It is also a defense with an offense when strategic requirements sometimes force it to turn to an offensive. However, today, which country is the hypothetical enemy of our country, or is it more than one country? The facts of the past are there, and the signs of aggression are obvious. It is not difficult to know.</p>
<p>(2) Unifying Aviation Administration The lack of unity in our country's air force has already been mentioned above. However, this lack of unity is very important to the future development of aviation. Without unified aviation administration, it is difficult to implement any modern aviation policy or the most perfect aviation plan. Even if it is implemented, it will not achieve satisfactory results. Therefore, today, unifying China's aviation administration has two major meanings: (A) All the air forces in the country should be under the jurisdiction of the only highest aviation authority of the central government. If the air forces of a country are not subordinate to each other, the airplanes used in various places will have no standards, and the types will be uneven. Once something happens, even if they can be concentrated, it is difficult to form a team and conduct organized operations under the command of a supreme commander. As for air force personnel, they are dispersed in various places and do not know each other. The training they receive is different, and the discipline is different. Even if they are assembled, how can they be coordinated? Are they not like a mob? (B) All aviation businesses should be managed and supervised by a supreme aviation administrative agency. In recent years, the aviation administration of great powers has been moving towards the path of unification. The first to create and implement it was the United Kingdom, followed by France, Italy, and other countries. They established an aviation department to take charge of all aviation (including army, navy, and commercial) design, management, and execution tasks, so as to unify aviation administration and increase the effectiveness of the air force. Considering the current situation in our country, to make the aviation industry economical and efficient, it seems that the aviation industry cannot be divided into the military, political, and administrative parts.</p>
<p>(3) Establishing Aviation Manufacturing Plants In addition to the three factories established by the Aviation Bureau in our country (the one in Hongqiao, Shanghai, was completely destroyed by the Japanese air force during the January 28th Incident [Shanghai Incident, 1932]), one is run by the Navy and the other is in Guangdong. However, they are mainly repair factories and can rarely manufacture airplanes themselves. This is due to the limitations of equipment, materials, and manufacturing personnel. However, the ability to manufacture airplanes independently is very important to the future of aviation. Self-made airplanes can not only avoid the outflow of rights and interests and reduce costs, but also ensure that there will be no interruption of supply in times of war. However, the establishment of aviation manufacturing plants requires a large amount of capital. If the government cannot afford to do it alone, it can also use the power of joint government-private operation, that is, government supervision and private operation. In European and American countries, aviation manufacturing plants are regarded as a large-scale enterprise operation. Most of them gather aviation experts and entrepreneurs to establish companies, issue stocks, and raise private capital to complete them. From 1927 to 1930, it was the era of American aviation fever at its highest point. The author was in the United States at that time and witnessed the rise of aviation stocks and the rush of people to buy them. He believed that aviation manufacturing in the United States had been completely industrialized and commercialized in peacetime, and the government's military aircraft were also becoming more elite as a result. The government only publishes the results of its research or the types and performance of airplanes it needs to the aviation industry, and the factories can compete to manufacture and sell them to the government. The government chooses the best ones to use. Therefore, the manufacturing capacity of American aviation is definitely the first in the world today. According to statistics, there are currently 28 aviation factories in the United States. If the manufacturing capacity of the entire country is integrated in wartime, it can produce 1,000 airplanes per month. Establishing a grand air force is just a matter of time. The importance of aviation manufacturing can be known.</p>
<p>(4) Training Aviation Personnel The central government has recently paid considerable attention to the training of aviation personnel. The above-mentioned Central Aviation School has been involved. However, we feel that its scale is limited and it cannot accommodate a large number of students. If no branch schools are established, it is hoped that the government will expand the number of people it trains to more than 500 pilots and mechanics each year. If there are 1,500 airplanes within three years, there will be no worries about the lack of personnel to fly, manage, repair, and maintain airplanes. At present, in addition to the central government, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have each established aviation schools. Member Jin Guan Jian also advocated the establishment of an aviation school by the 19th Route Army authorities. Roughly, they are all focused on military aviation. Among them, the aviation school in Guangdong is quite large in scale. However, for the sake of the future development of our country's air force, it is hoped that not only the air force units and administrative organs can be unified, but also aviation education must also tend to be consistent. If there is a unified aviation education policy and program nationwide, the talents trained will have roughly the same knowledge and skills, even though their sources are from the east, west, north, and south provinces. Then they can be used everywhere and can adapt to the situation. Regarding this point, we earnestly hope that the central aviation authorities will establish a policy and implementation plan for aviation education in our country as soon as possible (such as academic year courses, teaching materials, and teaching methods), and convene those in charge of aviation schools in the southwest and other schools that are not currently under the central government in Beijing or Hangzhou to hold a meeting to study and resolve everything. Then, the Central Aviation School will become the center of national aviation education, and the aviation schools in other provinces will be branch schools. The unification of aviation education can be expected. In addition, it is hoped that civilian flying can gradually develop by establishing flying clubs. Because the aviation schools run by the government currently focus on military flight education, and the number of people they can accommodate is still limited. Every year, hundreds of people who fail the entrance examinations, so it is imperative to promote civilian aviation in order to create a public aviation and to expand the economic relations and national defense supplements of aviation. As for the significance of establishing flying clubs and their necessity, the China Aviation Association has drafted a plan several months ago. The author has made the following explanation in the design book for reference:</p>
<p>[A flying club, also known as a flying club, aims to promote public interest in aviation and to cultivate flying talents in a more economical and simple way in practice. The reason why it is named a flying club instead of the original Western Flying Club is to avoid causing public misunderstanding that this organization is the same as ordinary clubs. The main purpose is to entertain. In fact, this kind of creation has a deep meaning. On the one hand, it is to implement flight training to reserve aircraft drivers for the country. On the other hand, because it is a non-military organization of the people, it can be opened to the public so that the public can visit at any time in order to promote aviation knowledge in the society. Today, when we talk about aviation to save the country, we must first make the public have aviation knowledge, which is what Westerners call "aviation brain". This kind of organization is very common in European and American powers and has been promoted to their colonies. Among them, the United Kingdom is the most characteristic. (There are 52 flying clubs) India (6) Singapore and Hong Kong have established many flying clubs in recent years......].</p>
<p>From the above explanation, the nature of the Flying Society and the necessity of its establishment are known. The society and the public cannot directly organize the training of military aviation personnel. If it is a flying club, it will be established by the people and the government will promote and support it. This time, the Aviation Association advocated the establishment of the Flying Society, which was approved by the authorities, allowing it to use the Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai to equip airplane sheds and conduct daily flight exercises. The Nanyang Tobacco Company also agreed to subsidize a part of the establishment costs. If there are other enthusiastic promoters of civilian flying who donate funds independently or jointly for the establishment of flying clubs, the establishment costs and operating expenses will be guaranteed and can be held at any time. The originally planned establishment cost of the Flying Society is about 150,000 yuan, and the operating cost is about 60,000 yuan per year, and it is expected to train 100 pilots each year. Last month, Mr. Sun Tonggang came to Shanghai and learned that the Aviation Association had a proposal to establish a Flying Society. He expressed his great approval and was willing to sacrifice a few months to help the Association in Shanghai after the completion of the national flying feat. The fact that he had personally seen the enthusiasm of Germany in promoting civilian flight in Shanghai made him believe that China could not be allowed to lag behind for so long. The author very much hopes that the first Flying Society in China will appear in Shanghai soon and will gradually spread to all provinces, so that all those who want to practice flying can achieve their wishes, and the air transportation industry and military aviation will also have a basis for development.</p>
<p>(5) The Importance of Air Defense Equipment There are broad and narrow definitions of air defense. The broad sense of air defense includes all air force organizations (air squadrons), ground air defense equipment (anti-aircraft artillery, searchlights, sound detectors), and training in civilian fire protection, bulletproof, and poison prevention. In short, everything that is needed to deal with the results of air combat is the responsibility of air defense. The narrow (also known as passive) air defense is limited to ground defense equipment. (i.e. air defense) to prevent the enemy from operating within our airspace. Reconnaissance and sabotage are all included. Air defense weapons, such as anti-aircraft artillery, can be moved to protect and assist the advance of the front-line troops. Stationary weapons can consolidate key fortresses, artillery forts, airfields, ammunition depots, etc., and protect the safety of the rear population, the safety of materials, and the stability of transportation. It is a principle of air warfare to use airplanes to fight airplanes. However, if there is no air defense equipment on the ground, and only air combat is used for emergency response, air defense is still incomplete. In this time of national crisis and the day of world arms race, how should the Chinese people pay attention to air defense equipment and training? During the January 28th Incident [Shanghai Incident, 1932], Japanese planes bombed the prosperous areas of the Chinese border in Shanghai, causing losses of more than 100 million yuan. If our ground had a dozen or dozens of anti-aircraft guns at that time, the enemy planes would never have dared to be so rampant. The installation cost of these anti-aircraft guns is only millions to several million yuan. (The price depends on the size and type of the gun caliber) Also, during the January 28th Incident [Shanghai Incident, 1932], because there was no anti-aircraft artillery on our ground, Japanese planes appeared in broad daylight without any fear. If there were anti-aircraft guns, the enemy planes would inevitably attack at night to avoid artillery fire. Therefore, in addition to anti-aircraft artillery, searchlights and listening devices must also be installed to deal with it. The lessons of the European War can be used to prove this. At the beginning of the Great War, German airships and airplanes attacked British and other cities during the day. When the British set up anti-aircraft guns to shoot them down, the German airplanes were damaged and changed to attacking at night. The British then set up searchlights and listening devices to detect the traces of enemy airplanes, aiming and shooting at them on the one hand, and ordering their own fighter planes to take off and fight in the air on the other hand. After the ground defense equipment was relatively perfect, the German airplanes gradually did not dare to do it again. Night bombing completely disappeared by the spring of 1918. Therefore, the value of air defense equipment cannot be underestimated. During the European War, air defense weapons were still in their infancy, and their achievements were already seen as such. Moreover, today, the manufacturing of air defense weapons is even better than before. (Because the structure and operation of these weapons have greatly improved) Recently, the Aviation Bureau has specially set up a high-firing class to train air defense personnel, which is indeed an urgent task. Our countrymen have always been very negligent in their air defense concepts. The following is a list of some of the weapons and equipment needed for air defense to show the scope and nature of air defense.</p>
<p>(1) Matters related to the deployment, installation, and operation of anti-aircraft artillery.</p>
<p>(2) Matters related to the equipment and operation of anti-aircraft machine guns.</p>
<p>(3) Matters related to the deployment, installation, and operation of aerial searchlights.</p>
<p>(4) Matters related to the deployment, installation, and operation of aircraft listening devices and calculators (to measure the distance and direction of enemy airplanes).</p>
<p>(5) Matters related to the concealment and camouflage of ground air defense works and equipment for the upper air.</p>
<p>(6) Dissemination of aviation information (using telephone flags, etc.). Matters such as the surveillance, warning, and reporting of the movement of foreign airplanes in the sky.</p>
<p>(7) Matters related to the organization and training of air defense teams.</p>
<p>(8) Matters related to guiding the rear population to deal with the safety of air attacks (such as avoiding poison, avoiding bullets, and turning off lights at night).</p>
<p>From the above-mentioned - the weapons used for air defense and their application, it can be known that air defense equipment and training are not simple matters, and they cannot be done overnight. If we do not start early, how can we prevent the great disaster of the future? We will build national defense from aviation, but in terms of the situation, we must plan and take care of both. Because air defense occurs because of aviation, we cannot but plan for air defense when planning for aviation.</p>

<p>Currently, the great powers are all frantically expanding their armaments, preparing for a second great slaughter. Since the world economic panic of 1929, the national economies of all countries except the Soviet Union have been mired in a deep quagmire, unable to extricate themselves. However, the military industry is the only exception, flourishing. The Washington and London Naval Agreements will expire in 1936, but the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan have already begun desperately competing to build warships. The expansion of the armies of various countries and the manufacture of the latest armaments are even more self-evident.</p>
<p>Among all methods of armament competition, the aviation craze is the sharpest and most ferocious. The great powers, in light of the significant role of aircraft during the World War and in recent years during the Japanese invasion of China, have all drawn their own conclusions, believing that the future re-division of the world and the struggle to seize colonies, markets, and raw material producing areas will depend on air warfare, not ground warfare. Therefore, under the condition of intensifying contradictions among the great powers in recent years, the aviation craze in various countries has reached its highest point. For example, take the news of large-scale air exercises that have shaken the world since April. In late May of this year, the U.S. Air Force held a large-scale exercise near Fort Knox in Kentucky, with 130 military aircraft participating. All infantry, artillery, and air units east of the Mississippi River participated. Subsequently, in July, the British Air Force held a large-scale exercise in London, with 380 aircraft participating, including 166 heavy bombers and 12 combat squadrons, involving 5,500 personnel engaged in simulated combat. Immediately after the United Kingdom, starting from August 1st, the French Air Force held a large-scale exercise in Toulon, with over 100 aircraft participating, including 40 large aircraft. Before the French large-scale exercise had ended, Japan followed suit. From August 7th to 11th, it held a large-scale Tokyo air defense exercise, with the United States as the hypothetical enemy, involving several hundred aircraft, covering one prefecture and four counties, a population of over 10 million, and seven major towns. The scale was unprecedented for the Japanese military. All these facts prove that the aviation competition craze in various countries is not intended for amusement, but reflects the main trend of current international politics. This trend is the preparation for a second world war.</p>
<p>2. Current Status of Aviation Industries in Various Countries</p>
<p>In the frantic competition in aviation, the great powers, in order to ensure a sufficient supply of aircraft for their own air forces and to prevent their supply sources from being blocked by enemies in wartime, are first of all striving to develop their aviation industries. In addition to powerful state-run military aircraft manufacturing plants, all privately-run aircraft manufacturing plants receive special protection and encouragement from the government. Today, several major countries already have powerful aviation industries.</p>
<p>Among them, the aviation industry of the United States can be considered to occupy the top position in the world. Its role in the national economy is not only a military industry, but has also become a sector of the national economy with civilian significance. In the so-called "prosperity" year of 1929, there were 92 aircraft manufacturing plants (a total of 101) operating in the United States, employing 16,105 workers. There were 30 aircraft engine manufacturing plants (a total of 32) operating, with 5,977 workers. In the same year, they produced 6,034 aircraft and 7,640 engines. Even in 1930, when the economic panic struck, they produced 3,640 aircraft and 3,766 engines, exceeding the total aircraft production of all other countries in the world combined.</p>
<p>The second place should be given to France and the United Kingdom. Currently, France has 48 aircraft manufacturing plants of all sizes, including 30 large aircraft manufacturing plants, 10 engine plants, and 2 airship manufacturing plants. Its production capacity is 6,000 aircraft per year, which can be increased to 12,000 aircraft in wartime. If existing factories are expanded and mass production methods are adopted, then 2,500 aircraft can be produced per month after the start of the war. The United Kingdom currently has 35 large-scale aircraft manufacturing plants, and its monthly production capacity can be increased to over 1,200 aircraft after the start of the war.</p>
<p>Hitler's Germany, although military aviation is completely prohibited under the Treaty of Versailles, its aviation is also very developed under the banner of civil aviation. There are 32 aircraft manufacturing plants nationwide, which can naturally be converted to military use in wartime, with complete equipment, superior technology, and full guarantees. Japan was unable to manufacture its own aircraft domestically during World War I. It only started setting up factories for imitation after the war. Now it has also established its own aviation industry. There are already 10 large-scale aircraft manufacturing plants, both private and state-run, and 5 engine manufacturing plants. Eight or nine out of ten military and civilian aircraft nationwide are now self-made.</p>
<p>In short, at present, the world aviation industry is mostly concentrated in the hands of a few major countries. The world aircraft market is entirely monopolized by them.</p>
<p>The aviation industry of socialist Soviet Union has also advanced by leaps and bounds. During the process of completing the first five-year plan in four years, its aircraft production increased threefold in quantity and fivefold in capacity. Engine production increased sixfold. Its military and civilian aircraft and parts can now be manufactured domestically without the need for foreign supply. 3. The Great Powers' Competition for Air Supremacy</p>
<p>Aircraft, because of its ability to soar into the sky without obstruction and its agile speed, has the following military advantages:</p>
<p>(1) In offensive warfare, it can assist the main force (such as by releasing smoke screens, scouting enemy locations, etc.) to advance.</p>
<p>It can unexpectedly bomb and destroy enemy cities, factories, and large buildings, causing enemy morale to waver and national sentiment to become chaotic.</p>
<p>(2) It can monitor enemy activities, restricting their movements to nighttime, making daytime movement virtually impossible. (3) It can destroy enemy transportation facilities, causing delays or interruptions in the supply of reinforcements and provisions.</p>
<p>(4) It can extend the front line to the enemy's entire country, penetrate deep into the enemy's hinterland, shake the hearts of the people nationwide, making it impossible to recover. (5) It is agile and can use swift and flexible means to resupply the besieged vanguard troops of our army with ammunition and food, and to rescue the wounded.</p>
<p>Moreover, the above points are not merely theoretical descriptions, but in the First World War and the Japanese invasion of China after the "September 18th" Incident, aircraft did indeed demonstrate such power. Therefore, the great powers learned these lessons and realized that aircraft in the Second World War would be the most effective and easiest-to-win main tool for killing people, and they are desperately expanding their air forces.</p>
<p>In recent years, although the budgets of the great powers have been in huge deficits under the conditions of the economic panic, their military expenditures have greatly increased compared to the eve of the World War—the fiscal year 1913-14. Among them, the increase in air force expenditures is the most severe. This can be seen from the following table.</p>
<p>Table of Military Expenditures of Great Powers in Fiscal Year 1931-32 (Fiscal Year 1913-14 = 100)</p>
<p>Country Name | Army Expenditure | Navy Expenditure | Air Force Expenditure | Total Military Expenditure</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>United Kingdom | 128 | 103 | 217 | 135</p>
<p>United States | 210 | 258 |  | 230</p>
<p>France | 149 | 142 | 264 | 181</p>
<p>Italy | 205 | 196 | 310 | 220</p>
<p>Japan | 188 | 279 |  | 235</p>
<p>(Note) The air force expenditures of the United States and Japan are included in the army and navy expenditures, so they are not specified separately.</p>
<p>In terms of air force strength, the preparations of the great powers are very impressive. According to a survey at the end of 1931, the following table:</p>
<p>Table of Air Force Strength of Great Powers at the End of 1931</p>
<p>Country Name | Units | Number of Aircraft (Units) | Personnel (People)</p>
<p>---|---|---|---</p>
<p>United Kingdom | (Regular) — 75(Special Reserve) — 5(Auxiliary) — 8(Total) — 88 | 1,500 | 32,500</p>
<p>United States | (Pursuit) — 11(Reconnaissance) — 13(Attack) — 4(Bombing) — 8(School) — 12(Total) — 48(Airship) — 2 | 1,660 | 11,000</p>
<p>France | (Reconnaissance) — 71(Combat) — 30(Heavy Bombing) — 12(Light Bombing) — 20(Total) — 133(Balloon) — 18 | 3,000 | 37,000</p>
<p>Italy | (Reconnaissance) — 36(Combat) — 38(Bombing) — 31(Machine Stable) Unknown — 14(Practice) — 14(Total) — 123(Airship) — 2 | 1,400 | 11,400</p>
<p>Japan | (Reconnaissance) — 11(Combat) — 11(Bombing) — 4(Total) — 28(Balloon) — 2 | 800 | 5,800</p>
<p>Needless to say, this only refers to the publicly available figures. In other words, it only refers to the lowest figures officially announced by each country. In fact, the actual military strength of each country, whether army, navy, or air force, is kept secret. At the same time, each country possesses a large number of civilian aircraft as a reserve force, which can be incorporated into military use once war breaks out. In short, the air forces of the great powers can be several times larger than the numbers listed in the above table in wartime, which is certain.</p>
<p>4. World Civil Aviation</p>
<p>Originally, the invention of aviation was a great achievement in modern science and technology. Its true great value lies in giving mankind many new and excellent methods in the struggle against nature. The main ones are:</p>
<p>(1) Economic aspects—In agriculture, aircraft can be used for sowing seeds and controlling pests in fields. In fisheries, aircraft can be used to search for fish schools. In vast forest areas, aircraft can be used to detect fires, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Scientific aspects—Aircraft can be used to explore high mountain peaks, volcanoes, and volcanic craters. During polar expeditions, aircraft can be used to scout ice conditions. In meteorology, aircraft can be used to observe high-altitude weather and celestial bodies, as well as to measure mountains, aerial photography, and map making, and to plan urban construction, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Transportation aspects—Because aircraft have extremely high speeds, the spatial distance is greatly shortened. Since the British Industrial Revolution, the speeds of various types of transportation tools such as trains, ships, and automobiles are far inferior to that of aircraft.</p>
<p>(4) Cultural aspects—Newspapers can use aircraft to gather news and deliver newspapers. In the event of major earthquakes, floods, etc., aircraft can be used to rescue refugees, etc.</p>
<p>However, these advantages of aircraft, except in the Soviet Union, are still considered by the great powers to be of less value than their military value. Therefore, they are still rarely used.</p>
<p>What is currently being developed among the great powers is only air transport. This is still inseparable from military purposes. Because, first, the progress of aircraft is rapid. Aircraft that left the factory yesterday already feel outdated today. Therefore, the great powers have no choice but to take the outdated aircraft to the civilian market. Second, in order to maintain the aviation industry and continue work without interruption, in preparation for wartime applications. Third, in order to train flight personnel and technology to meet the needs of wartime. In addition, air travel is very expensive, and most people cannot enjoy it widely. Therefore, the current civil aviation of the great powers is all subsidized by the government. For example, in the United States, according to the "Waters Act," the government subsidizes 40 cents to $1.20 per mile for the air transport of every nine pounds of mail, the amount depending on the significance of the air route. In 1928, the German government's subsidies for civil aviation reached 60 million marks. Although it was reduced to 38.7 million marks in the following year due to the economic panic, it increased again to 45 million marks in 1930. The British government signed a contract with "Imperial Airways" (the air transport business of the British Empire, almost entirely held by the company), providing annual subsidies of £335,000 in the two fiscal years 1929-30 to 1930-31, and annual subsidies of £310,000 in the fiscal years 1931-32 to 1934-35. Thereafter, the subsidy decreased by £5 each year until the fiscal year 1938-39. In 1930 alone, the French government's subsidies for civil aviation reached 210 million francs. The Italian government's aviation expenditure was 56 million lire in the fiscal year 1920-21. After the Fascists came to power, it increased year by year, reaching 718 million lire in the fiscal year 1930-31, about 13 times more than ten years ago. Japan's subsidies for civil aviation are even more severe. In the fiscal year 1928-29, it was US$290,000. In the following year, it increased to US$1.36 million.</p>
<p>With the encouragement and subsidies from various government departments, the air transport business of the great powers has been actively developed in recent years. According to the figures surveyed in 1931, the following table shows:</p>
<p>Table of Current Status of Civil Aviation Businesses of Great Powers</p>
<p>Category | United States | United Kingdom | France | Germany | Italy</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Number of Aircraft | 9,818 | 899 | 1,122 | 984 | 649</p>
<p>Flight Personnel | 16,130 | 955 | 1,100 | 5,500 | 357</p>
<p>Airline Companies | 44 | 1 | 6 | 2 | 6</p>
<p>Total Length of Air Routes (Kilometers) | 89,214 | 14,655 | 38,675 | 37,552 | 14,428</p>
<p>Number of Airports | 1,708 | 97 | 102 | 254 |</p>
<p>Air transport has also increased dramatically compared to four years ago—1928. This can be seen from the following table:</p>
<p>Comparison of Air Transport of Great Powers in 1931 with 1928</p>
<p>Country Name | Flight Distance (Thousands of Kilometers) | Passenger Transport (People) | Mail and Packages (Kilograms)</p>

<p>(Note) The figures for both countries are for 1929.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, due to its different direction of development, civil aviation has achieved development in all aspects. During the five-year plan, the entire country has been connected by air routes. With Moscow as the center, regular trunk flights have been established to Vladivostok in the Far East, Baku in the South Caucasus, Tashkent in Central Asia in the southeast, and Berlin in Germany in the west. At present, the length of Soviet air routes ranks first in the world, and mail transport ranks second in the world. As for the application of production aviation and scientific aviation, it is even more unmatched by the imperialist countries.</p>
<p>Table of Civil Aviation Development in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Category | 1928 | 1932</p>
<p>---|---|---</p>
<p>Air Transport |  |</p>
<p>Total Length of Air Routes | 11,500 Kilometers | 30,500 Kilometers</p>
<p>Passenger Transport | 10,600 People | 31,600 People</p>
<p>Mail and Packages | 255.4 Tons | 1,006 Tons</p>
<p>Production Aviation |  |</p>

<p>Aerial Survey | 30,700 Square Kilometers | 105,000 Square Kilometers</p>
<p>Mosquito Control for Malaria | — | 590,000 Hectares</p>
<p>Forest Patrol Area | — | 11,000,000 Hectares</p>
<p>Industrial Aerial Photography | — | 113,400 Square Kilometers</p>
<p>In addition, the Soviet Union has also widely used aviation assistance in various explorations in Central Asia, Siberia, and the Arctic Ocean. In 1932 alone, the total flight distance in various explorations in the above-mentioned areas was 170,000 kilometers. In recent years, the great achievements of the Soviet Union in developing the Arctic Ocean have benefited greatly from the help of aircraft.</p>
<p>5. Development of Aviation Technology</p>
<p>The problem is not that one country alone has aircraft, but that all countries have them. As a result, the great powers have to try to defeat their enemies in aviation technology. This motive for competition has pushed the great powers to continuously improve aircraft. On December 17, 1903, the American Wright brothers successfully made the first test flight with an engine-equipped aircraft. After that, it was gradually improved. In July 1909, the Frenchman Louis Blériot even flew an aircraft across the English Channel. At that time, it was on the eve of the World War. The great powers had attached great importance to the role of aircraft in the military and competed to study and improve them. During the war, Germany used aircraft to bomb Paris and London, which alarmed the participating countries even more, and they rushed to build aircraft to meet the challenge. Since then, the aviation competition among the great powers has unfolded. In the 15 years since the armistice, the progress of aviation technology cannot be measured in terms of distance. In terms of military value, the aircraft that the great powers painstakingly built in the years after the war are now too outdated and not applicable.</p>
<p>In 1918, the greatest achievement in aviation technology was the three-engine aircraft. But now, in 1933, it is the twelve-engine aircraft. At the same time, in 1918, the maximum speed of flight was 130 kilometers per hour, the maximum non-stop flight distance was 500 kilometers, the endurance was 5 to 6 hours, and the maximum load capacity was 500 kilograms. However, now (1933), it is very different. The maximum speed has reached 720 kilometers per hour, the non-stop flight distance has reached 12,600 kilometers, the endurance has reached 84 hours, and the load capacity has reached 10 tons.</p>
<p>The following table shows the process of technological development of aircraft since its invention:</p>
<p>Category | 1903 (Invention) | 1912 (Pre-War) | 1918 (Post-War) | 1933</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Speed (1908) | 44 kilometers per hour | 171 kilometers per hour | 130 kilometers per hour | 720 kilometers per hour</p>
<p>Distance (1908) | 0.26 kilometers | 1.017 kilometers | 500 kilometers | 12,620 kilometers</p>
<p>Altitude (1908) | 0.11 kilometers | 5.61 kilometers | ? kilometers | 13,157 kilometers</p>
<p>Endurance | 53 seconds | 13 hours 17 minutes 57 seconds | 5-6 hours | 84 hours</p>
<p>Load | — | ? | 500 kilograms | 10 tons</p>
<p>In addition, current fighter aircraft, in addition to rapid-fire small-caliber machine guns, can also be equipped with large-caliber machine guns and cannons. In addition to carrying medium-caliber bombs weighing 100 kilograms to 250 kilograms, bombers can also carry bombs weighing 500 kilograms, 1,000 kilograms, and even 2,000 kilograms. The fall of such bombs can destroy the ground to a depth of several tens of meters.</p>
<p>Due to the advancement of aircraft technology, the safety of flight has also gradually increased. Incidents have been reduced to a minimum. According to materials on U.S. civil aviation, the average number of deaths in flight incidents during the years 1918 to 1921 was one person per 186,000 miles. During the years 1922 to 1925, there was only one person per 789,100 miles.</p>
<p>In terms of the progress of various flight equipment at present, it is possible that aircraft will be able to fly in the air day and night in the near future. October 5, 1933.</p>

<h3 id="e18">The Starting Point and Significance of the Shanghai City Center Construction <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng —</p>
<p>Shanghai was originally an ordinary city, but due to decades of continuous construction and the painstaking efforts of countless talented individuals, it has achieved its important status today. Today's Shanghai is not only the economic and cultural center of our country but also an important global commercial port. Transportation routes converge here, merchants gather in droves, and goods from all over the country are distributed here, accounting for sixty to seventy percent. The population has also increased to over three million. Since the national government established its capital in Nanjing, Shanghai's position in politics, diplomacy, military affairs, and economics has become increasingly important due to its role as the gateway to the Yangtze River and the shield of the Southeast. Therefore, the prosperity and development of Shanghai today are deeply and significantly related to the survival of the entire nation and the livelihood of its people.</p>
<p>However, when we look at Shanghai's original facilities, there was no overall design at the beginning, and the streets lacked planned regulations. Now, it is difficult to improve them. In the future, the impact on transportation will be even more unbearable. In terms of population and commerce, Shanghai is already the fifth largest city in the world, with tens of millions of tons of ships arriving annually. However, regardless of the size of the ships, they must travel for another hour or even several hours after arriving at the port to berth. Sometimes, passengers cannot even disembark directly, and various goods cannot enjoy the convenience of land-sea combined transportation. This kind of loss in time and economy is rare among major commercial ports in the world and is a major obstacle to Shanghai's future development.</p>
<p>Therefore, with great foresight, Sun Yat-sen had already pointed out the direction of Shanghai's transformation in his book "The International Development of China." Sun Yat-sen said:</p>
<p>[Although Shanghai has now become the largest commercial port in China, Mr. Wu, the mayor,</p>
<p>If this remains unchanged, it will not be suitable for the needs and requirements of becoming a global commercial port in the future.</p>
<p>[From any point of view, Shanghai is a stagnant port, but in my China development plan, Shanghai has a special position. Upon careful consideration, Shanghai can still find a way to be saved.</p>
<p>[My plan to establish a world port in Shanghai still retains the existing layout from the mouth of the Huangpu River to the confluence of the Gaoqiao River upstream of Jiangxinsha. ... Therefore, according to my plan, we should further extend the waterway that has been completed by the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau and expand the curved part of the right bank of the Huangpu River. From the confluence of the Gaoqiao River, we should open a new river that runs straight through Pudong. Starting from the second bend upstream near the Longhua Railway, it should be filled to Yangshupu Corner and then rejoin the main stream of the Huangpu River. In this way, the river flow from this point to a point diagonally opposite Yangshupu will be as straight as a string. From here, it will reach Wusong in a gentle curve. This new river will incorporate about thirty square miles of land as the city's residential center and create a new Huangpu Bund. The current winding Huangpu River in front of Shanghai will be filled in to create broad roads and commercial land.]</p>
<p>When Mr. Huang Yingbai, the first mayor of this city, took office in the sixteenth year of the Republic, he followed Sun Yat-sen's instructions and determined the city's area and various construction plans. Mr. Zhang Boxuan, who succeeded as mayor, continued to follow the previous policy and worked hard to carry it out. In November of the sixteenth year, a design committee was established to study various municipal problems. In order to understand the conditions of each urban area, in July of the seventeenth year, he led the heads of various bureaus to inspect the urban areas in person. At the same time, a portion of the urban area was taken over, making it directly under the jurisdiction of the municipal government. Mayor Zhang Yuejun, who succeeded him, selected the area north of Xiangyin Road, east of Songhu Road, and south of Zhaoyin Road as the site for the construction of the city center. In July of the eighteenth year, the city center area plan was announced, and a city center area construction committee was established. In order to promote the development and prosperity of the city center area, he resolutely advocated building municipal government buildings in the city center area first to promote it. Funds were designated from the first municipal government bond issued in this city to be used for the operation of the city center area. In July of the nineteenth year, an architect's office was established. In May of the twentieth year, bidding began, and construction officially started in early June. On July 7th, the groundbreaking ceremony for the new municipal government building was held. Therefore, the completion of the new municipal government building today is the result of the hard work and careful planning of successive mayors. I, Tiecheng, am optimistic about its success today, and I feel a great sense of responsibility in carrying on the past and opening up the future.</p>
<p>Indeed, the completion of the new municipal government building is only the starting point for the construction of the city center area. Considering the complexity and grand scale of the Greater Shanghai Plan, this small building is just a drop in the ocean. However, what we should have confidence in today is that the current location of the city center area is close to Wusong in the north, adjacent to the concession in the south, bordered by the Huangpu River in the east, and connected to the railway in the west. It has convenient transportation and is centrally located. The name "center" truly reflects its reality. In a few years, its development and prosperity will surely far surpass the concession. This is what the citizens of Shanghai should have confidence in, move forward courageously, work hard on construction, and promote its development.</p>
<p>In recent times, the biggest problem in the national spirit has been the disappearance of national self-confidence and cultural creativity. People tend to be decadent and superstitious about Europeanization, not knowing that the true essence of Western material civilization lies in the creation and improvement of materials, not in the enjoyment and consumption of materials. As a result, the needs of clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all satisfied by Western materials, which satisfy their desires. They despise domestic products, and no one is willing to use their energy to seek improvement on their own. Therefore, Shanghai's development in the past eighty years has not only failed to contribute to the slightest progress of our national culture, but the customs of the people and the spirit of the nation have become increasingly decadent. No wonder the British literary giant, George Bernard Shaw, was deeply shocked by the disappearance of Chinese culture as soon as he arrived in our country.</p>
<p>A nation must have a place to stand on earth. If the people of a country do not have the ability to create their own needs in life, it is the biggest crisis in the life of the nation. The people of the country should not only be happy to rely on Europeanization and comfortable living in concessions, but should think about the crisis of their nation, revitalize the spirit of creating culture, improve their living conditions, open up a field of prosperity and development, and establish a foundation for the development of their nation.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether the Shanghai city center area can develop is not simply a problem of one city, but a test of whether the entire Chinese nation can create culture, can be self-reliant and survive, and can eliminate its inferior habits of following old ways, relying on others, seeking comfort, and enjoying pleasure. The completion of the new municipal government building today is, in a small sense, the starting point for the construction of the city center area and the first step in the implementation of the Greater Shanghai Plan. But in a larger and farther sense, it is also the revival of the Chinese nation's inherent ability to create culture and the expression of the spirit of independence and self-improvement.</p>
<p>The municipal scholar Munro said, "The awakened citizens are the driving force for urban development." Therefore, the construction of the city center and the development of Greater Shanghai in the future will depend even more on the awakening of our citizens. I hope that our citizens will recognize the profound and great significance of the construction of the city center area, work hard together to achieve complete success, and have high expectations.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Summary of the Design of the New Municipal Government Building <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Design Process</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the municipal government of this city, the office buildings of the affiliated bureaus and offices have been separated and scattered in the areas of South Shanghai and the new West District. The transfer of documents is time-consuming, and it is inconvenient for citizens to travel back and forth. In view of this, the municipal government had the idea of building a new municipal government to bring all bureaus and offices together in one place to increase administrative efficiency in the seventeenth year of the Republic, and established a committee to prepare for the construction of the municipal government to make plans. After the delimitation of the city center area, in order to be the hub of the entire city, the core of the area should be the location of administrative organs. Therefore, at the beginning of the establishment of the city center area construction committee, the work of the committee to prepare for the construction of the municipal government was ordered to be taken over. After receiving the order, the committee referred to the materials of administrative regions of various countries and, based on the current situation of the municipal government and its bureaus, formulated three design standards: 1. The three-dimensional style of the new municipal government should be Chinese style.</p>
<p>2. The plane layout of the new municipal government should be separated by bureaus. 3. The construction steps of the new municipal government should be built in stages. According to the above-mentioned standards, the method of soliciting architectural designs for the municipal government with a reward was drafted, and the solicitation began on October 1 of the eighteenth year. A total of forty-six architects from China and abroad registered to participate. The deadline was February 15. On February 19, Mr. Ye Yuhu, Mr. Murphy, former design consultant of the national capital, Mr. Bai Yunshi, a famous engineer of this city, and Mr. Dong Dayou, consultant of the city center area construction committee, were specially invited as judges and consultants to conduct the review based on the judging standards. The judging standards were as follows:</p>
<p>[First, the overall layout must be very compatible, including the roads, rivers, pools, and bridges around the buildings. Second, the appearance and decorations of each building must conform to the national architectural style. Third, the area of each building must be roughly consistent with the number stipulated in the solicitation method, and the phased construction of supporting facilities must be taken into consideration.]</p>
<p>The results of the judging: First place Zhao Shen, second place Wu Zhenying, third place Fei Libo, and additional awards Li Xianpei and Xu Tang Shi Changgang.</p>
<p>According to the judging report: The designs obtained in this solicitation each have their own strengths, but the biggest shortcomings are that the plans are too scattered, and the distance between the bureaus is too far, which cannot achieve the effect of centralized management. The second common shortcoming of the applicants is that they failed to fully utilize the inherent Chinese architectural style. However, the purpose of this solicitation was originally for reference and not to seek a final plan. Therefore, after the end of the solicitation, Mr. Dong Dayou drafted six types of administrative area plans in addition to the three award-winning designs of the first, second, and third prizes, and finally decided to adopt the first type. On April 9 of the nineteenth year, the winners were invited to review the designs together, and the style of the administrative area was first determined. Everyone agreed that the first type was relatively satisfactory and used it as the basis for the new administrative area plan. At the same time, according to the selected administrative area plan, the style of the new municipal building was studied, taking the architectural style of the Beijing Palace as a reference and combining it with modern needs, so that beauty and practicality were both achieved. After the plan was determined, the architect's office was established in July of the nineteenth year. Based on the decided administrative area and the style of the new municipal government building, all drawings and specifications were made, and after being approved by the municipal conference, the bid for the new municipal government building was invited in May.</p>
<p>As a result, the construction was undertaken by Zhu Senji Construction Factory. Construction started in June, and the cornerstone laying ceremony was held on July 7. The construction was suspended for about five months due to the January 28 Incident, so the completion date was changed to October of the twenty-second year.</p>
<p>Brief Description of the Administrative Region Plan</p>
<p>In recent years, major cities in Europe and the United States have gathered public institutions in one place, called "administrative region." Not only is it convenient for office work, but gathering major buildings in one place can concentrate the essence of the city and enhance its appearance. The plan of the Shanghai Administrative Region is based on this purpose. The administrative region is in the shape of a cross, located at the intersection of the north-south and east-west avenues, covering an area of about 500 acres. The office buildings of the municipal government are in the center, and the buildings of the eight bureaus are arranged on the left and right. The municipal assembly hall, library, museum, and other public buildings are scattered within this cross shape, with rivers, pools, bridges, and arches decorated in between, becoming a model area for the city. To the south of the municipal government, a square is opened, covering an area of about 120 acres, which can accommodate tens of thousands of people for military parades or citizens' meetings. A high tower is built at the intersection of the two avenues, representing the center point of Shanghai. Looking around from the top of the tower, the entire city is in sight. The high tower can be seen from a distance on the four avenues, standing in the clouds. To the south of the square is a rectangular area, using the existing river water. At both ends of the pool, five-story memorial archways are built, representing the south gate of the administrative region. On both sides of the pool are important public buildings. At the east and west ends of the municipal government, there are smaller rectangular pools. At the extreme ends of the pools, gate towers are built, representing the east and west gates of the administrative region. On both sides of the pools are also public buildings.</p>
<p>The buildings of the municipal government and various bureaus are all in sight from the south, reflecting in the pool, adding to the scenery. Viewed from the north, it also forms a front, and viewed from the east and west, it also forms a complete structure. The plane layout, except for the municipal government, can be added one after another, which is very suitable for phased construction. To the north of the municipal government is the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, facing the municipal government, as a public gathering place. The surrounding area is left empty, which not only avoids overcrowding, but also allows a full view of the memorial hall. Before the completion of the buildings of various bureaus, two temporary office buildings will be built, located to the north of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, with simple styles, which can be used for other purposes in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Brief Description of the New Municipal Government Building <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The preliminary problems in the design of the new municipal government building are as follows:</p>
<p>An aerial view of the layout of the municipal government and the buildings of various bureaus</p>
<p>1. The three-dimensional style should be Chinese style.</p>
<p>2. The plane layout should be separated by bureaus.</p>
<p>The reasons why the three-dimensional style should be Chinese style are:</p>
<p>1. The municipal government is the administrative organ of the entire city, which is observed by both Chinese and foreigners. Its architectural style should represent Chinese culture. If other countries' architecture is adopted, how can we promote the national system and arouse the feelings of overseas Chinese?</p>
<p>2. The architectural style is the embodiment of the cultural spirit of a country. Therefore, the architecture of each country has its own characteristics that express its nationality. Recently, Chinese architecture has invaded the trend of Europe and the United States, which should be corrected to fulfill the responsibility of promoting national culture. Moreover, the construction of the municipal government adopts the Chinese style, which is enough to show the citizens a model.</p>
<p>3. There are tens of thousands of great public buildings in the world, and the construction costs are in the hundreds of millions. There are no lack of great buildings in this city. Now, with limited funds, we are building a municipal government that is related to the appearance of the entire city. If we do not create a new one, it will be difficult to stand side by side with the buildings in this city.</p>
<p>The reasons why the plane style should be separated by bureaus are:</p>
<p>1. Chinese architecture is mostly flat and short, with ordinary one or two floors. The plane expansion is also limited. If it is too high, it will lose the Chinese architectural style. The area required by the municipal government and various bureaus is very large. If they are combined in one place, it will be too high.</p>
<p>2. The new administrative region is a vacant field, and more buildings should be built to decorate it, which is different from building government buildings in a prosperous city. Therefore, various institutions should not be merged. It is better to have a number of smaller buildings connected together to form a magnificent building than to have an extremely tall building isolated in an open space.</p>
<p>3. When the original budget was tight, the entire construction of the municipal government could not be realized overnight and had to be built step by step. The separation of bureaus is very suitable for phased construction. Each time a building is added, it will not affect the completed parts. The following is a brief description of the new municipal government building in Nanshi.</p>
<p>The municipal government building is at the head of the bureaus and is the main building of the entire building. It should be taller than the other bureaus. However, the number of people working in the building is quite the opposite, so the municipal government's public auditorium, library, and cafeteria are incorporated into the municipal government building to make it the tallest building.</p>
<p>Height: Chinese architecture is usually flat and short, and it loses its characteristics if it is too high. Moreover, the land price in the administrative region is still cheap, and there is no need to rise high. However, it cannot be too low to lose its dignity. It is now set at four floors. From the outside, the first floor is a platform, and a two-story palace-style building is built on the platform. The top floor is used on the roof. The first and third floors are office locations, the second floor is the auditorium, library, and meeting room, and the fourth floor is used on the roof as storage and living space. The whole building is divided into the middle and two wings. The middle part is taller because the flat roof of the auditorium is higher, so the whole building must be raised. The offices of the mayor and senior staff are also in the middle, so it is also important to show the importance of the middle part.</p>
<p>Length: Due to the roof relationship, Chinese architecture cannot meet the size of the plane. When necessary, only a few houses can be connected to one place. Now the site of the new municipal government building is very large. In order to comply with the Chinese architectural regulations, the whole building is divided into three sections, the roof is also divided into three parts, and the total length of the building is set at 93 meters.</p>
<p>Width: Chinese architecture is usually rectangular, and the width is half of the length. The new municipal government building is 93 meters long, so it should have a corresponding width. However, in order to get sufficient light, the width should not be more than 20 meters. According to this ratio, the building seems too narrow. To remedy this, the whole building is divided into three sections. The width of the middle section is set at 25 meters, and the width of the two wings is set at 20 meters.</p>
<p>Exterior: The beam-column type is the oldest type in architecture. Egypt and Greece are based on the beam-column type, and so is Chinese architecture. The characteristic of Chinese beam-column type is the use of various colors to decorate the beams, columns, and other parts. The exterior of the municipal government adopts this style. The first floor is a platform, surrounded by railings, and the upper part is a beam-column structure. The roof is covered with green glazed tiles. The entire foundation of the building is more than 90 meters, which is too long. Therefore, the middle part is increased in height, so that the roof is also divided into three sections. There is a huge ladder from the ground directly to the auditorium, and the main entrance is below. Carriages can go directly to the door. On both sides of the front ladder, there are giant lions guarding.</p>
<p>Interior Layout: Due to budget constraints, the interior layout focuses on practicality and does not engage in luxury. The entrance is located on the first floor, with four doors in the front, back, east, and west. There is a cross-shaped hall connecting the escalator and elevator in two places, directly to the fourth floor. Each floor is equipped with two toilets. The first floor includes the cafeteria, kitchen, waiting room, cloakroom, vault, and offices that have contact with the outside world. The second floor is the auditorium, library, and meeting rooms, which are completely separated from the office. There is a huge ladder from the ground outside directly to the auditorium, which is both convenient and spectacular. The middle of the third floor is the office of the mayor and senior staff, and the two wings are the offices of each department. The fourth floor uses the roof gap, the light is not very sufficient, as a public storage and file room and telephone machine room. The whole building is distributed as follows.</p>
<p>Basement: Boiler room, coal room, cook room.</p>
<p>First floor: Main gate reception, guard office, mail room, cloakroom waiting room, accounting office, vault, general affairs office, first section office, cafeteria, kitchen, meter room, public telephone room, etc.</p>
<p>Second floor: Auditorium, library, large and small reception rooms, etc.</p>
<p>Third floor: Mayor's office, secretary's office, counselor's office, technology officer's office, accounting office, and offices of the second, third, fourth, and fifth sections, etc.</p>
<p>Fourth floor: File room, storage room, telephone machine room, bedroom, servant room, etc.</p>
<p>The main interior decoration follows the Chinese style, with beams and columns painted in colorful colors, and the rest of the rooms are simple.</p>
<p>Electrical equipment: The municipal government is an administrative organ, and the electrical equipment is very complicated. The following is a list:</p>
<p>1. Electric lights: All electric wires are hidden in seamless steel pipes plated with zinc. All pipes are placed in the wall. There are a total of 455 electric lights, 101 electric light sockets, and 321 electric light switches.</p>
<p>2. Electric fans: Electric fans are divided into wall fans and ceiling fans. There are a total of 18 wall fans, 31 ceiling fans, and 119 fan switches. The kitchen and preparation room are equipped with one exhaust fan each. 3. Electric bells: The location of the electric bells must be determined according to the desk. Currently, only the output terminal is prepared, which runs along the wall and is installed inside the footrest.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>(Special Issue of the Municipal Government)</p>
<p>4. Electric clocks: A total of 36 electric clocks are installed in the main homes and halls, which are driven by the master clock.</p>
<p>5. Telephone: All telephone equipment is completely provided by the municipal government itself. Only ten external trunk lines are borrowed from the Shanghai Telephone Bureau. An automatic switch with 300 numbers is installed internally, and 80 telephone output terminals are available. All equipment is the latest German product.</p>
<p>6. Elevator: For the convenience of going up and down, three elevators are provided. The inside of the elevator is 4 feet 6 inches long and 3 feet 7 inches wide, with a load of 925 pounds (can accommodate 6-7 people), and a speed of 150 feet per minute.</p>
<p>Hot Air Pipe Equipment: The cost of installing hot air pipes is quite high, but it is necessary to have equipment for keeping warm in winter. At present, the municipal government and various bureaus use coal stoves and electric stoves, which cost a lot every year. For permanent savings, it seems that hot air pipes should be installed, and their cleanliness and convenience are not comparable to coal stoves. In order to avoid waste, a single-pipe down system is adopted. A boiler is set in the basement. The area of the hot air pipe is 9,000 square feet. When the outdoor temperature is 30 degrees, the indoor temperature can be heated to 70 degrees.</p>
<p>Sanitary Equipment: Sanitary equipment includes toilets, washbasins, and cold and hot water. All appliances are the latest. A water tank is installed inside the roof with a capacity of 1,500 gallons. A hot water tank is installed in the basement with a capacity of 400 gallons. There are 34 flush toilets, 25 urinals, 31 washbasins, 35 washbasins, 1 bathtub, and 91 cold and hot water faucets in the whole building.</p>
<p>Fire Fighting Equipment: One fire hydrant is installed near the escalator on each floor, for a total of eight. The wall is equipped with a 75-foot-long and 3-inch-diameter hose.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Conclusion <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Major cities in Europe and America build municipal governments at the expense of huge sums of money. The government building is the focus of the city and is a model for public buildings. Its function is not only limited to office use. However, in this autumn of national disasters, when funds are tight, we have to simplify everything. The design of the new Shanghai municipal government building is in line with this purpose. In addition to using steel and cement as a frame, everything is done in the most economical way. For example, the outer walls and railings are made of artificial stone, the floors of the auditorium, cafeteria, and hall are made of cylinder bricks, and the floors of the offices are made of artificial floor, all for the sake of saving money. It is not possible to say that it is satisfactory.</p>
<p>In addition to the municipal government building, there are various bureaus. Due to limited funds, they can only be built year by year. At present, two temporary office buildings for various bureaus are being built near the municipal government. The style and materials are saved. When the new buildings of various bureaus are completed in the future, they can be used for other purposes.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Summary of the Shanghai City Center Area Plan <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai's position, from the perspective of the country, has become the largest commercial port. In the world, it also occupies a considerable position. In the future, if we want to seek its development, we must use a broad vision and make careful and detailed plans, which are not enough to meet the needs of the future. Here, the first thing to pay attention to is the current status of municipal administration and the future development trend.</p>
<h3 id="e23">The Status of Municipal Administration <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Today's Shanghai, the so-called prosperous area, is only the concession. Once you enter the Chinese territory, although the area adjacent to the concession has slightly changed its old appearance, the more distant areas still do not get rid of the state of the former rural society. This kind of deformed development is the biggest disease of the city's municipal administration. Let's briefly say:</p>
<p>1. The concession runs across the center of the city, so that all the facilities in South Shanghai and Zhabei are divided into two. The financial and human resources are not economical, and the most difficult thing is the transportation connection between the north and south cities.</p>
<p>2. The concession authorities have built roads beyond the boundary over the years. From the 26th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty to the 14th year of the Republic of China, there are about 11 miles in North Shanghai and about 165 miles in West Shanghai. The power of the concession is increasing day by day, and the obstacles to the city are increasing.</p>
<p>3. The general stations of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines are close to the concession, and the ships enter from Wusong and go up the Huangpu River to the bank of the concession. The Wusong River runs across the center of the concession, and the water and land transportation actually helps the development of the concession.</p>
<p>This is just to say the various reasons that hinder the overall municipal development of the city. As for the Shanghai concession itself, there are three shortcomings that can be mentioned:</p>
<p>1. Most of the existing docks in Shanghai have no connection with the railway, which is extremely uneconomical for cargo transportation. Due to the development of commerce and the increase in the tonnage of imported ships, the location of the docks is becoming increasingly crowded. Most of the sea ships have to stop in the middle of the Huangpu River or anchor at the mouth of the river, and the goods are transported ashore by barges, which is time-consuming and costly. 2. The people living in Shanghai, except for the very few, the most difficult thing in life is to solve the problem of housing. In recent years, land prices have increased and rents have increased. From the perspective of economy, hygiene, and other aspects, it is a very big social problem.</p>
<p>3. Due to the increasing progress of modern transportation equipment, the width of the existing roads in Shanghai is becoming increasingly narrow. Moreover, most of the roads were built decades ago, so there is no system to speak of. As for zoning, Shanghai has never implemented it.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Future Development Trends <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>To seek the development of this city, recovering the concessions has always been seen as the fundamental solution. Judging from the current situation, the recovery of the concessions is only a matter of time. However, after the recovery, whether the concessions can become the future core of the entire city of Shanghai is highly questionable. Because this city is located in a strategic area, and the region is vast (Panoramic view of Shanghai), careful planning and management should consider the overall situation and future development. The development of a city must rely on something. Speaking of Shanghai, its development to this day is solely because it is the only major port in East Asia. Therefore, to enhance the position of Shanghai's port, opening the port of Wusong is imperative. Wusong and Shanghai are only ten kilometers apart, and the two parts will definitely merge into one in the future. Based on current conditions and extrapolating, if the opening of Wusong port is expected to materialize, and the existing railway layout can be changed, then the center of the entire city may move north from the concessions. Currently, the city's commerce is concentrated in the southeastern part of the Public Concession. The French Concession and the western part of Shanghai are mostly residential areas. In Pudong, only the area along the river has some docks, and the rest is mostly farmland. Although its location is only a river away from the concessions, land prices are vastly different. In the future, if transportation issues can be resolved satisfactorily, the development of Pudong will have unlimited prospects. However, its position and nature will ultimately remain subordinate to the concessions, unable to escape their control. Therefore, it is not suitable as the future city center. Recognizing this, the Shanghai Municipal Government demarcated an area of approximately 6,000 acres in July of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, north of Xiangyin Road, south of Zhayin Road, east of Songhu Road, and west of the Tenth and Fifth Tu of Zhounan, as the city center area. There are several important reasons for this: the location is strategically located, surrounded by Baoshan City, Hujiazhuang, Dachang, Zhenru, Zhabei, the concessions, and Pudong, seemingly controlling the entire city; designating it as the city center area is consistent with its name and reality, firstly. Wusong and Shanghai are only ten kilometers apart, and this area is located in between. In the future, it will gradually expand to the north and south, connecting the two places into one, and the formation of a hub for the entire city can be expected soon, secondly. The terrain is flat, with few villages, which can achieve the benefits of construction on level ground, while avoiding the trouble of renovating existing urban areas, saving costs and making it easier to achieve results, thirdly. The area is near the Huangpu River, close to the concessions in the south, and water and land transportation are extremely convenient. Even before the construction of the new commercial port and railway, considerable development can be expected, fourthly. From the above, for the sake of future needs and construction convenience, this area is the most suitable location for the city center, and there is no doubt about it.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Transportation Zoning Plan <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Now that the city center area has been selected, before planning begins, we must simultaneously consider water and land transportation, road systems, zoning planning, etc., to achieve uniformity and interconnection. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Water and Land Transportation: In terms of waterways in this city, the Huangpu River is the main artery. Currently, the important docks are all located in or near the concessions. However, as business develops in the future and the number of seagoing vessels increases daily, simply constructing large-scale ports will be insufficient to meet the needs. Therefore, the future dock area will be in Wusong. The Pudong coastal area can be used for the expansion of the commercial port. The area east of Wuquan Road in the city center, along the Qiujiang estuary, is most suitable for the early construction of docks. Currently, inland transportation mostly uses the Wusong River. In the future, with the northward shift of the city center, the Yunzao Creek will become the hub for inland transportation. If canals can be dug at suitable locations to connect with the Wusong River, transshipment will become even more convenient. As for land transportation, the existing railway main lines are the Beijing-Shanghai Line, with the North Station in Zhabei as the terminal, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line, with the South Station in Nanjing as the terminal. Between these two main lines, there is a connecting line from the South Station via Longhua, Xujiahui, Fanwangdu, to the North Station. In addition, there is the Songhu branch line, starting from the North Station, passing through Jiangwan, Wusong, and reaching the fort of Taiwan. This is the current situation of the city's railway lines. In terms of layout, it not only does not benefit the current situation of the city, but even hinders future development. The obvious example is that the Zhabei area has declined due to the railways crisscrossing it, and there is no possibility of revitalization. Furthermore, the railways are far from the waterways and docks, which prevents the interconnection of water and land transportation, which is also ill-advised. Therefore, with the future northward shift of the city center, the existing railway lines in Shanghai must be slightly altered. It is assumed that a branch line will be built near Zhenru, passing north east of Dachang and Hujiazhuang, turning east along the south bank of the Yunzao Creek to the Wusong area, connecting with the commercial port and the Hongjiang docks. Another branch line will be built from Zhenru, passing through Pengpu and reaching Jiangwan, to serve as the future Shanghai Central Station, so that passengers and light cargo can be directly transported to the city center. The position of the North Station can still be preserved. The route of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line will remain as before, but starting from the South Station, the route will be extended, a bridge will be built across the river, and it will proceed north along the Pudong coast to Gaoqiao Sha, so that transportation in Pudong can also be made more convenient.</p>
<p>2.  Road System: Regarding the road system in the city center area, the Shanghai City Center Area Construction Committee has detailed diagrams and explanations, which can be referred to. Only the main points are described below:</p>
<p>First, build main roads connecting the commercial port, the railway, and various districts to facilitate transportation. These roads are generally very wide, connecting either to the future commercial port, or to the future central station, or to the existing concessions and other urban areas, like rays of starlight radiating outwards, with the city center in the middle, controlling the overall situation.</p>
<p>Second, build ordinary roads to facilitate commerce and residence. The purpose of these roads is to facilitate commerce and transportation in and around the city center, and to divide construction sections to facilitate construction. The currently planned routes are approximately 170 kilometers long. The layout uses both grid and spider web patterns, depending on whether the surrounding main roads are orthogonal or diagonal, and the final sections are suitable for construction. In addition, because Shanghai's houses are best facing south due to the climate, the east-west direction of each section is lengthened to reduce the number of north-south roads. Furthermore, the sections parallel to the main roads are also lengthened as much as possible to reduce the intersection of ordinary roads with the main roads.</p>
<p>Third, establish parks and sports fields to benefit the health and recreation of citizens. For the sake of the health and mental well-being of citizens, large parks and open spaces are established in and around the city center area, and efforts are made to ensure suitable interconnection to beautify the cityscape and facilitate sightseeing.</p>
<p>3.  Zoning Plan: Now that the road system in the city center area has been planned, the area should be further divided according to the use of buildings, so that each piece of land is used to its fullest. According to the citywide zoning plan announced by Shanghai, the city center and the area south to the old city of Nanshi is a commercial area; the area to its north is a commercial port area; and the area to its west is a residential area. However, based on the nature of the city center, it should naturally be the concentration of the city's commercial essence. Considering the general practice of urban organization, it should also be the location of administrative organs and important public buildings. Moreover, in the early stages of construction, when the city's market is not fully developed and land prices have not yet risen sharply, it is also possible to designate a portion for residential construction, so that citizens in the area can live nearby. The zoning plan for the city center area is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Political Area: Administrative organs and important public buildings should be located in the heart of the city, in a strategically advantageous location, to show solemnity and inspire awe. The central part of the city center area, where two main roads intersect, and adorned with parks, is most suitable for designation as a political area. The Municipal Government and its affiliated bureaus, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Council, libraries, museums, art galleries, etc., should all be built here.</p>
<p>Commercial Area: The northern part of the city center area, adjacent to the commercial port and connected to the passenger terminal, will foreseeably flourish in commerce. A large portion is designated as a commercial area to adapt to the trend of development. In addition, the land along the main roads has heavy traffic. Building shops here is not only beneficial for trade, but also isolates the residential area behind, shielding it from noise and dust, so it is also designated as a commercial area.</p>
<p>Residential Area: The land in and around the city center area, except for the portions already designated as political and commercial areas, is all designated as residential areas. The residential area is further divided into two types: A and B. Type A residential area is for the construction of high-end residences, requiring tranquility, so its location is near parks and open spaces. Moreover, because the supply and demand for this type of residence is relatively small, the area is also small. Type B residential area is for the construction of ordinary residences, with greater supply and demand, so the area is also large.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Implementation Procedures <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of its establishment, the Municipal Government had the idea of ​​taking the Jiangwan area as the city center, opening up the Wusong Commercial Port, and improving the city's railways. After a long period of investigation and research, in July of the eighteenth year, it submitted the 123rd Municipal Conference, which resolved to designate the area east of Songhu Road, west of the Pujiang River, north to Zhayin Road, south to Xiangyin Road, east to the planned route, and west to Songhu Road, as the city center area, and from the date of the decision, to stop the transfer of land sales in the area. The above resolution was subsequently submitted to the Municipal Construction Discussion Committee for reconsideration and passed by the Municipal Government for formal announcement. In August of the same year, the City Center Area Construction Committee was established to preside over the design of the city center area. In the winter of the same year, Municipal Engineering Experts from the United States who attended the International Engineering Conference in Tokyo, Messrs. Gong Shiqi and Fei Libo, were invited to Shanghai for consultation. Currently, the road system of the city center area and the citywide zoning and transportation plans have been announced one after another; and a reward was once offered for architectural designs for the new Municipal Government. These designs have been carefully designed by the City Center Area Committee and are now all ready and are being implemented sequentially. Among all the plans, the most important ones are the construction of a new commercial port and the improvement of the city's railways. Only when these two issues are resolved can the foundation of the city center area be established and the healthy development of the entire city be anticipated. Regarding the construction of a new commercial port, experts are being hired to properly formulate plans, so that it can be implemented simultaneously with the construction of the city center area. Regarding the improvement of the city's railways, the Municipal Government has submitted the planned plan to the Ministry of Railways for approval in July of the nineteenth year. As for the construction of the city center area itself, the following items are being carried out or have been completed according to the work plan:</p>
<p>1.  Opening Main Roads: Among the first phase of main roads in the city, those directly related to the city center area include Zhongshan North Road, Qimei Road, Sanmin Road, Wuquan Road, Songhu Road, Shuidian Road, Zhayin Road, etc. All of the above roads have been completed, either newly opened or improved from old roads.</p>
<p>2.  Constructing New Municipal Government Buildings: Although the various plans for the city center area have been gradually completed, before these plans are realized, it is feared that citizens' investment in the area will be hesitant. Therefore, the Municipal Government will first move to set an example, and in the future, all parties will come upon hearing the news, and it will definitely become a magnificent sight. A foundation laying ceremony will be held on the fifth anniversary of the Municipal Government. This project has been slightly delayed due to the January 28th Incident and is expected to be completed in October of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China. The formation of the city center area will begin with the construction of the Municipal Government buildings. As for gathering the Municipal Government and its bureaus in one place to improve the efficiency of office work, that is a secondary matter.</p>
<p>3.  Inviting Land Claims: In recent years, land prices in Shanghai have become increasingly expensive, and rents have increased day by day, with a concept of every inch of land being worth an ounce of gold. From an economic, health, and various other perspectives, this is a very large social problem. The Municipal Government recognizes the need to remedy the above facts urgently. Moreover, because the city center plan is roughly scaled and the Municipal Government buildings will soon be completed, in order to promote market prosperity and encourage construction, the regulations for inviting land claims in the city center area have been stipulated, and the most valuable parts of the land used by the Municipal Government are announced for invitation at extremely low prices. The first phase of the release is bounded by Sanmin Road to the north, Xiangyin Road to the south, Songhu Road to the east, and the administrative area of ​​the city center to the west, with a total of approximately 800 acres (see the regulations for inviting land claims for details). The method has been announced and implemented by the Municipal Government on June 1st of the twentieth year. Now, the second phase of releasing a portion of land north of Sanmin Road and east of Zhayin Road is also continuing.</p>
<p>4.  Constructing Deep-Water Docks: In recent years, the tonnage of ships has increased year by year, and the draft has reached over ten meters (Panoramic view of the Shanghai Central Station). The location and equipment of all the docks in Shanghai are insufficient to accommodate the berthing of these large ships. If this continues, Shanghai's shipping will inevitably decline if it does not quickly seek improvement and open new ports and docks. In addition to Wusong, where the river water is deep and the coastline is long and has been designated as the location of the new commercial port, the Qiujiang estuary also has relatively deep water and is suitable for dock construction. Before the Wusong Commercial Port plan is realized, it is planned to build new-style docks there first to meet urgent needs. (See the Hongjiang Dock Plan for details). 5. Constructing a Bridge over the Huangpu River: According to the latest real estate valuation, the land price on Nanjing Road Bund in the Public Concession is 300,000 taels per acre. On the opposite side of Pudong, the average land price along the river is 3,000 taels per acre, and further inland, it is only 200 to 300 taels per acre. The difference in land price is so great, even though they are only separated by a river, which shows the importance of transportation. Recognizing this, the Municipal Government proposed to build a bridge across the river near Longhua, extending the railway to Pudong. The Pudong Road in the first phase of the city's main roads has also been built. If a bridge is built over the Huangpu River in addition to this, the Pudong area will develop even further. In order to enhance the position of the city center area, the bridge site should be near the city center. The land price on the Pudong side will also inevitably rise due to the construction of the bridge, and this land policy can be used to raise part of the construction costs, which is a win-win situation. 6. Constructing Roads, Ditches, Parks, and Sports Fields: In addition to the main roads, the roads in the city center area or other parts of it have also been paved and drainage ditches have been built separately from the twentieth to the twenty-third year to facilitate traffic. Furthermore, in view of the lack of parks and sports fields in the city, parks and sports fields have been opened on the vacant land northeast of Songhu Road and Xiangyin Road to provide citizens with places for recreation and to hold large-scale joint movement meetings.</p>
<p>The above is a brief description of the progress of construction in the city center area. In summary, this initial work plan includes opening up roads, constructing new municipal government buildings, moving the station, opening up a commercial port, and building a bridge over the Huangpu River to connect with Pudong. If all the above points can be realized one by one, the development of the city center area can be expected soon.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Sources of Construction Funds <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Municipal construction does not aim to make profits. However, if it can attract the progress of industry and commerce, the city's revenue can be increased and the development of the social economy can be promoted. It is not a win-win situation. If the above plans to build a city center, open a new commercial port, and improve the city's railways can be implemented one by one, Shanghai's future development cannot be described in words. It can be asserted that construction costs will also be compensated. It is now assumed that the first phase of construction will require 50 million yuan, and its use and budget are as follows:</p>
<p>Land Acquisition: 20 million yuan</p>
<p>First Phase of New Commercial Port and Dock Project: 10 million yuan</p>
<p>Central Station Project and Additional Tracks: 5 million yuan</p>
<p>Huangpu River Bridge: 5 million yuan</p>
<p>First Phase of Municipal Government and Bureau Building Project: 2 million yuan</p>
<p>Road and Ditch Project: 5 million yuan</p>
<p>Other: 3 million yuan</p>
<p>Total: 50 million yuan (including the 5 million yuan for the third item, which can be used for other purposes after the advance payment is recovered)</p>
<p>The Municipal Government recognizes the difficulty of the city's finances and knows that municipal construction is important, but the city is in such a state of decline that it is impossible to drain the pond to catch all the fish and increase any donations or taxes. It also recognizes that good municipal administration can prosper industry and commerce and increase land prices, so European and American countries have what is called a land policy in municipal administration, the main idea of ​​which is to purchase a large amount of land at fair market prices before the new urban area is opened, which can be used for the construction of roads and parks in the future. Once municipal administration develops and land prices increase, the remaining land can be sold, and the surplus can be used for continued development of municipal administration. Based on the above ideas, the Shanghai Municipal Government announced the city center area plan in August of the eighteenth year and simultaneously announced that it would acquire approximately 6,000 acres of land in the area at the land prices at that time. If the Huangpu River Bridge and Wusong Port projects can be realized in the future, a large amount of land must continue to be purchased before implementation. Before the completion of all construction, all acquired land should be leased to collect rental rights fees and annual rental fees as collateral for public debt interest. The rental rights fee is paid in full at the time of obtaining the rental rights and will not be returned, and the annual rental fee is paid quarterly. As for leasing the coastline of the commercial port or collecting fees for dock warehousing and stacking, the amounts are considerable and can be used as a reserve for the first phase of the project and stored in a bank for turnover. After the completion of the first phase of the project, land prices will inevitably rise sharply, so before proceeding, the total land price of the new urban area should be estimated in order to collect land tax; this can not only supplement the construction funds but also be used to continue to purchase land; this is the fundamental problem for developing the city center and should not be underestimated.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Expectations for All Sectors <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Although the plan for the city center area has a rough outline, whether the entire plan can be implemented smoothly in the future depends entirely on the availability of funds. The fundraising requires either a large subsidy from the central government or the issuance of public bonds. Whether the public bonds can be sold depends on whether the collateral is reliable and whether the future benefits are credible. Therefore, this plan has repeatedly considered the above points, hoping that the financial, business, and all sectors will fully support it so that this plan can be completed successfully.</p>

<h3 id="e29">The Progress of Modern Warfare Tools <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Although the tone of non-war is sung very high, pacifists not only express their rejection of war, but also try their best to oppose it, so that war—bloody war—will not be realized. However, in fact, from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic coast, the chimneys of factories in various countries are emitting the mad roar of manufacturing weapons of murder, and they are proudly claiming that they have overcome the economic panic. At least the major countries in the world are preparing for a two-pronged policy: on the one hand, they sing peace, and on the other hand, they are fully preparing for war. In Western Europe, Germany is demanding equality in armaments and nakedly praising war; in France, it is strongly advocating security guarantees, but secretly deciding to strengthen its armaments. At the same time, all the small countries in Europe that are able to be independent are expanding their armaments. Even small countries that are almost unable to survive and rely entirely on borrowing money, such as Austria and Hungary, their largest expenditure in their national budgets is still military spending. Needless to say, Japan in the East. Its military budget this year accounts for more than 36% of Japan's national treasury expenditure. In secret, it borrows for restoration projects, civil engineering projects, etc., which are ostensibly other expenses, but in reality are a kind of military construction. Next year, Japan's military expenditure budget will reach a total of 1.3 billion yen. With such a huge number, who can say that this is not active war preparation? In practical action, the capitalist countries are indeed with arrows on their bows, ready to be drawn and released. Furthermore, disarmament conferences, the Four-Power Treaty, etc., cannot prevent this movement from proceeding. At most, they can only ease the time of war, but they cannot eliminate war or prevent the development of war preparations. Therefore, the socialist Soviet Union must also turn the gears of its Five-Year Plan to engage in the manufacture of armaments. Although it is said to be defensive in nature, no one is willing to openly deny peace before the international stage has opened up the war. The Japanese imperialists are even more blatant in wanting to prepare for industrial mobilization in addition to military industrial mobilization.</p>
<p>In the past wars, in the era of spears, halberds, knives, and swords, personal talent was the main thing, and weapons occupied a secondary position. Even after the invention of firearms, group military actions surpassed personal talent, and combat was mainly collective. Therefore, the fearlessness of Africans and the bravery of Hui people are actually no worse than any European. The reason for their failure is that they do not know how to use modern organized training and do not have huge collective actions. Therefore, modern firearms cannot exert all their functions. Now, light and heavy machine guns, cannons, and other military weapons must be operated as a whole by groups in order to express the functions of these new weapons.</p>
<p>The progress of new weapons is changing faster than Shanghai's fashion, and their pure consumption is something that people know. However, most people still desperately strive for victory and concentrate their efforts on military consumption. Therefore, all new inventions, especially machines and the use of electricity, occupy a priority position in the military. The expansion of arsenals in advanced countries goes without saying. It is mobilizing the entire country's strength to engage in the production of military supplies. In China, which has a relatively backward industry, such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and other provinces, there are almost no modern industrial organizations. In places where chimneys cannot be seen, their arsenals have thousands of workers working day and night. Even if the weapons they manufacture are not enough to compete with neighboring countries, and even if they are only limited to military power, they are still using military industry to stimulate society and maintain their current position. Countries that are preparing for war most urgently, such as Japan, not only have their arsenals not declined due to the market decline, but also have some industries become active due to the needs of the military industry.</p>
<p>Before the First World War, the most important military weapons were iron and coal, followed by the raw materials for gunpowder, and the final decisive military force in the army was still the infantry. However, this kind of planar warfare has been transformed into three-dimensional warfare. The movement of troops has changed from human power to the activity of automobiles, trains, and tanks. This is not even considered, because it is only the activity on the ground plane, which is only a change in the speed of military action. Fundamentally, there is still no special and significant difference. But it is different with the addition of airplanes and seaplanes. With the air force, not only has there been a huge change in reconnaissance of enemy intelligence, but also there have been unprecedented changes in combat methods. At the same time, because of the development of explosives, dropping bombs from airplanes and machine-gunning from airplanes gradually showed their effectiveness at the end of the Great War. In recent times, it has become especially clear. Airplanes dropping bombs are not only limited to the front lines. They can safely cross very strict lines of defense and travel thousands of miles to the rear to carry out destructive work. For example, if Japan and the Soviet Union start a war one day, Soviet airplanes can fly from Vladivostok or Khabarovsk across the Sea of Japan to bomb important cities such as Tokyo and Osaka. Another example is if the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union use force, Soviet airplanes can destroy the oil fields and pipelines in Persia and Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Moreover, the role of the air force is more than that. The weapons used for destruction are not only bombs. No matter how violent bombs are, their bombing range is limited. In general, it is not difficult for society to avoid bombs. However, if the bombing of airplanes is fully exploited, it is enough to make the society of the warring countries feel enormous threats. In particular, densely populated large cities are more affected. As three-dimensional aerial warfare develops further, the time for flying will be extended and the use of poison gas will be expanded. Then, the extension of the war zone will reach the entire warring country. The entire population will be in a state of war, not just the soldiers on the front lines. In particular, the use of poison gas will send important cities down the path of destruction. The importance of chemical warfare is attracting worldwide attention.</p>
<h3 id="e30">The Use and Types of Poison Gas <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Weapons of external injury, such as knives, guns, and artillery shells, have been used for a long time. Everyone knows their effects, so there's no need to elaborate. It is only internal injury weapons that seem to be recent. However, the fact is that they existed in ancient times. For example, using wind and sand to trap enemies, or even creating artificial wind and sand, such as using galloping horses to stir up dust, making it difficult for the enemy to fight. In China, after the Tang and Song dynasties, whenever there were rebellions, either the government troops or the rebels often used chili peppers and other irritating poisons to harm the crowds gathered together to escape the chaos, in order to seize property. Another example is the "soul-stealing incense" of previous generations. Although it was not formally used in warfare, there is no doubt that it was a poison. However, those all utilized natural poisons. After the 19th century, science gradually developed, and chemistry followed suit. As a result, various poisons continued to appear, such as Cyanic acid (HCNO) and Cacodyl radical (AS(CH3)2), which were once attempted to be used in fortresses.</p>
<p>Because of this, when the Hague Peace Treaty was established in 1899, it was agreed to prohibit harmful poison gases. However, when conflicts of interest became irreconcilable, the so-called treaty became a useless black print on white paper. On April 22, 1915, Germany, in order to maintain its victory, tore up the Hague Peace Convention and made extensive use of Chlorine gas. As a result, the participating countries competed with each other to use improved and newly invented poisonous gases. At that time, there were more than 30 kinds of poison gases used on the European battlefields. And during research, it was considered that it has a considerable function, with a total of more than 300 kinds. However, only the following types can be considered excellent for use and the raw materials are not difficult to collect.</p>
<p>1.  Phosgene: COCl2 – Began to be used in December 1916.</p>
<p>2.  Diphosgene: Cl-CO-CCl3 – Used in July 1916.</p>
<p>3.  Yperite (Mustard Gas): CH2Cl-CH2-S-CH2.CH2CH2Cl – Started to be used in July 1917.</p>
<p>4.  Chloropicrin: CCl3NO2 – Started to be used in May 1917.</p>
<p>5.  Diphenylchloroarsine: (C6H5)2AsCl – Started to be used in September 1917.</p>
<p>6.  Diphenyecyanoarsina: (C6H5)2As(CN) – Started to be used in June 1918.</p>
<p>7.  Ethyldichloroarsine: C2H5-AsCl2 – Started to be used in April 1918.</p>
<p>In addition, many other types of poison gas can be mentioned, such as the Kwai gas, but they are not very intense, so they are omitted.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the first type, phosgene, is much more toxic than the initially used Chlorine gas. In addition to causing coughing, vomiting, and headaches, it can also cause the lungs to rupture, difficulty breathing, and a decrease in body temperature. At normal temperature, this substance is a colorless gas with a particularly unpleasant springy smell, so it is called asphyxiating gas.</p>
<p>The second type [diphosgene] is easily decomposed under sunlight due to the coal contact effect of iron or lead. Although its toxicity is weaker than that of phosgene, it can last for a long time. Its destruction of the respiratory organs is similar to that of Chlorine gas, so it is also an asphyxiating poison, and it also has tear-inducing properties.</p>
<p>The third type, Yperite, began to be used during the Battle of Ypres. When its toxicity is very small, its effect is very slow. It often takes several hours to develop. Also, because it is a very dense liquid, it is sprayed out of the poison gas bomb as a gas or as fine mist particles. Therefore, it easily stays on the ground for a long time. When the weather is good, it can last for ten days. It may even last for two weeks on cloudy days. Its toxicity, in the smallest amount, can cause deep sores on the skin and can cause coughing, sneezing, and tearing. If the amount is slightly larger, it will cause the conjunctiva to turn red, the voice to become hoarse, and blisters to form on the skin, leading to tracheitis and pneumonia, and even death. Therefore, it has asphyxiating, tear-inducing, and corrosive toxicity. And one thing that is difficult to treat. This is the most toxic substance among blistering gases.</p>
<p>The fourth type, Chloropicrin, is a colorless, oily liquid that is not easily dissolved in water, but heating it will release phosgene. When the gas bomb is sprayed, perhaps a part of this decomposition will occur. This substance is not only tear-inducing, but also has asphyxiating properties.</p>
<p>The fifth type, Diphenylchloroarsine, is a white solid. Although its tension in the gas is small, its toxicity is very severe. In the air, its presence is less than one part in ten million, which is enough to make people sneeze. If it is increased by another one part in ten million, it can cause vomiting. If it is increased further, it can lead to death. Another particularly terrible thing is that it does not dissolve in water, and when it is sprayed out, it is in the form of fine particles, so gas masks and other things have little effect on this substance. Therefore, its toxicity is even more terrible than that of phosgene.</p>
<p>The sixth type, Diphenyecyanoarsine, is also a solid. At normal temperature, its tension is very small, but its effectiveness is much greater than that of Diphenylchloroarsine. If every cubic meter of air contains 0.000025 grams of Diphenyecyanoarsine, it can cause death from sneezing and tearing within a few minutes.</p>
<p>The seventh type, Ethyldichloroarsine, although its toxicity is relatively weak, it is very convenient to manufacture and the raw materials are easy to obtain. Its irritation is also quite strong, and it also has significant corrosive properties. Its harm to humans and animals is almost the same as that of [Yperite].</p>
<p>The above-mentioned poisons were all invented in the 19th century, but they were only moved to the battlefield for use during the Great War. As for the raw materials used in manufacturing, such as chlorine, sulfur, arsenous acid, alcohol, benzene oil, aniline, bleaching powder, sodium nitrite, sulfurous gas, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, caustic soda, etc., are all commonly used in ordinary chemical factories. During the World War, Germany and France had planned to use poison gas to account for 25% of the amount of gunpowder used. The United States prepared to use 40% of poison gas. We don't know what will happen in the future. However, the world is paying attention to poison gas, publicly and secretly establishing chemical research institutes, forming chemical warfare teams, and spending a lot of money on chemical research and the manufacture of poisons. And all countries in the world are keeping these matters strictly secret, so we cannot fully understand how much poison they can produce each month and how powerful its toxicity is. We only know that after the Great War, the United States could produce 1,100 tons of liquid chlorine, 1,500 tons of chloropicrin, 1,600 tons of phosgene, and 4,000 tons of Yperite per month. This adds up to 8,200 tons of poison gas, which is enough to make people tremble. Moreover, in recent years, with the progress of chemical warfare preparations, the major capitalist countries such as Britain, the United States, France, Japan, and Germany, as well as the Soviet Union on the other side, have all been concentrating and secretly researching chemical warfare tools and manufacturing large amounts of poison gas. Once war breaks out, who knows how many people will be sacrificed under these kinds of poisons.</p>
<p>Defense Against Poison Gas</p>
<p>We are certainly not praising war, and even less are we advocating war. Even the psychology of the general public, especially the psychology of us Chinese people, is mostly peace-loving and hopes for peaceful coexistence. However, in modern society, especially in international relations, even though the call for peace is very high, in reality, preparations for war are the most active and powerful. Therefore, we cannot ignore the trend of war, and we must pay attention to the tools used in war. Then, at the very least, we must know that when a crisis comes, China cannot escape the scourge of war. Especially the large cities along the river and coast are even more dangerous. Therefore, we should regard the use of poison gas as a military issue, without discussing it for the time being, but we must have universal training in the defense against poison gas, so that we will not panic when the crisis comes, and then we can slowly plan a response.</p>
<p>Speaking of defending against poison gas, the most fundamental thing is to first understand poison gas. In other words, it is to detect poison gas. That is to say, to judge the type of poison gas used by the enemy as quickly as possible to the best of our ability. This kind of education is prepared most thoroughly in Germany. It has made so-called educational gas, and also made matches for checking gas. As a result, the general public is immersed in chemical products. Everyone is accustomed to seeing and familiar with the odor and irritation of gas. When something happens, there is a temporary way to deal with it. Japan has also recently conducted air defense exercises and poison gas exercises repeatedly, so that the general public has common knowledge of poison gas defense.</p>
<p>The passive defense methods for poison gas can be roughly divided into two types. One is individual protection, and the other is group protection.</p>
<p>The methods used for individual protection include gas masks, protective clothing, and independent breathing apparatuses. Group poison gas defense is for defense within a certain range, either for the defense of the army or for the disinfection of toxic areas.</p>
<p>The task of the gas mask is to teach people to inhale air that does not contain toxicity. Underneath the gas mask, there is an inhalation bag. In this bag, neutralizers, absorbents, and the like are placed to allow the poison gas to undergo chemical absorption or physical mechanical absorption in this small space. The most common absorbents are activated carbon, soda ash, filter paper, etc., so that poison gas or mist particles cannot reach the respiratory organs. The so-called independent breathing apparatus is completely isolated from the air containing poisonous substances. The device itself has enough air or oxygen for breathing. However, this can only defend against asphyxiating or sneezing gases. It cannot fulfill its defensive responsibility for blistering gases. Therefore, there is now a separate gas suit for defending against poison gas, which is used to protect the whole body, so that poison cannot penetrate the skin. Such gas suits are made of tree glue and oilcloth.</p>
<p>As for group poison gas defense, houses or underground buildings are used to create a kind of poison gas defense equipment. First, there are extremely fine devices at the windows and doors to prevent toxic air from entering. Furthermore, poison gas filters are installed on these windows and doors. However, the air volume in a room is limited after all. If many people live inside, it is impossible to breathe for a long time. Therefore, a poison gas defense must have an independent device to supply breathing to the people living in the house.</p>
<p>The disinfectants for various poison gases are as follows: for asphyxiating gases, use sodium hyposulfite solution and Arga solution for disinfection. For tear-inducing and sneezing gases, use Arga solution and alcohol of peracidium sodium. For blistering gases, use Argali solution, bleaching powder solution, and bleaching powder, etc. for disinfection.</p>
<p>This article only provides a kind of common sense explanation of the understanding and defense of poison gas, and it is not a specialized research. If you want to study it specifically, you must read specialized writings. Therefore, this article will stop here for now and will not elaborate further.</p>

<p>(Beiping) Military News, Xiyuan Telephone, the front line is still in a state of truce.

<p>(Beiping) Wan Fulin led the military staff to the Mafang front line for inspection at 2:00 p.m. today. Shahe was peaceful this morning. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) At 9:30 this morning, He Yingqin summoned Guo Yunlong for a long conversation. The authorities' opinion is roughly that Fang's troops should first be transferred to the designated location, and the military branch will send personnel to count them, and reorganize and dismiss them separately. The other party hopes that he will leave the army, and the authorities can guarantee his personal safety. Guo will stay in Ping temporarily, awaiting summons. Fang's original letter to He said, Respectfully, Minister Jingzhi, my public appraisal, brother stationed between Mamatun, the situation is not allowed, and there is really no other intention in my heart. Brother Cheng loves me deeply, and I will do my best to cooperate. It is out of the question for both parties to follow orders, but Zhongfu is in jail, and Yunsheng is going elsewhere because of something. I hereby send Guo Yunlong to visit and represent my humble sincerity, and to discuss everything. I hope to give sincere advice and show good strategies. Public and private friendship are deeply grateful. The unfinished intention is to be expressed by the representative. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang's representative, the political director, Major General Councilor Guo Yunlong, was sent from the front at 12:00 last night, carrying Fang's handwritten letter to He, which has been forwarded to the Military Branch. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Jibu's remnant troops still occupy the Datangshan, Xiaotangshan and Caoxinzhuang areas. As of this afternoon, there is still no action. The National Army is strictly guarding it. Yesterday afternoon, Guo Yunlong, the director of Fang's political department, went to the National Army's defense line and claimed that he was ordered by Fang to go to Ping to meet He and negotiate the reorganization. Fan Yonghe, an adjutant lieutenant from the 129th Division, was assigned to accompany him to the Xiyuan Military Department for a short stay. This morning, Wan sent an adjutant to transfer him to the First Division of the Military Branch. After the division inquired about his intention, they sent personnel to visit He at Jurentang. He was busy with official business, so the secretary met him instead. Guo then took out Fang's handwritten letter to He, roughly stating that he is now stationed between Mamatun, which is compelled by the environment and has no choice. Wang Zhongfu was unable to leave because of something, so he specially sent Guo Yunlong to visit, asking for a personal meeting, etc. The letter was issued on the 8th and signed by Fang himself.

<p>(Beiping) Wan Fulin talked about the fact that the outside world misunderstood the Pingbei battle this time, saying that there was a gap between Yu and Fang. In fact, Pingbei is the defense area of ​​Yu's affiliated troops. Fang Xiang attacked Beidi. Yu is the national army, and he is naturally willing to obey orders and stand firm. Yu and Fang do not know each other, so how can he have hatred with him? Tangshan is an outstanding position, and our troops only sent a small number of troops to be stationed there as a lure to the enemy, so when Fang Jibu attacked, he gave up in order to lure them to outside the agreed line and encircle them. However, after Fang Jibu arrived at Tangshan, he stopped advancing, so he is still confronting the two sides. The defense of the troops under Yu's command has been arranged and it is decided to ensure that there is nowhere to go. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Mafang Telephone, the two armies have stopped fighting on the front defense lines of Mafang and Wazuowei. The soldiers are building defensive works within the Second Defense Line, less than a mile away from Fang Jibu's outpost. Fang arrived at Xiaotangshan from Nie Shanzhuang on the afternoon of the 8th and stayed at the Tangshan Hotel. In the Gaoliying northwest of Xiaowangfen, dozens of Fang Jibu's cavalry were found to be moving and scouting this morning. They were shot at by Zhao's regiment sentries, and the enemy also returned fire before the brigade retreated. Jibu is currently on the right wing of Tangshan. Because Fang sent a representative to surrender, Ji Bang was at a loss and had the intention of fleeing north again. His troops are now concentrated in Qincheng Xingshou. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Zhenwu entered Tangshan the day before yesterday and ordered merchants to set off firecrackers to welcome him. Fang's troops originally planned to launch a general attack today.

<p>(Beiping) Zhu Hongxun said that during the Tangshan battle the day before yesterday, his division sent two battalions to attack Caoxinzhuang and Huludong. At that time, the two places had been captured. Fang Jibu's casualties in that area reached more than 400 people, and our division suffered casualties of 70 to 80 people. Fang Ji concentrated all his strength to bypass and attack Tangshan. Ji personally led a force and advanced from Houshiniufang. Zhan Tao led a force and attacked from Liushucun. He himself only led a platoon of infantry in Tangshan City. When the enemy advanced, he swept with machine guns. Fang Ji advanced with a dense team, so the casualties were extremely high. Zu, the commander of the 3rd Brigade of Fang's troops' training division, and Zhan Tao, the commander of the 3rd Garrison Regiment, were both killed. At night, because Tangshan was outside the Chen Di area he had originally planned, it was inconvenient to defend it for a long time, so he immediately gave it up and led his troops to the Benshe village, Chen Di. There has been no action on the front in recent days. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

He will stay at the Takarazuka Hotel tonight, and then take the Chichibu Maru to Yokohama at 3 p.m. tomorrow. After arriving in Kobe, Ambassador Zhuang spoke to the reporters of the Telegraphic Communication Agency on the Chichibu Maru as follows. The relations between China and Japan have improved recently, and I deeply believe that they will move forward to a more friendly relationship in the future. As for how to handle the future relations between China and Japan, it is necessary to go to Tokyo to meet with Foreign Minister Hirota, ask for his opinion, and then report to the domestic government before deciding on a countermeasure. I heard that Foreign Minister Hirota has an understanding of the China-Japan issue, which is deeply expected. Yu's return to the country is due to illness and has no other deep meaning. He has recently recovered greatly from his illness, so he is returning to his post, and he will not issue any statement when he returns to his post. In addition, the Chinese Communist army is particularly rampant, so after the relations between China and Japan have been settled, he will do his best to fight against them.

<p>Shao Yuanchong... Restore the National Spirit</p>

Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Shao Yuanchong reported, saying that tomorrow is the anniversary of the Xinhai Uprising and the opening of the National Games. The day after tomorrow is the anniversary of the Prime Minister's ordeal in London. Yesterday, the Chairman also convened a meeting of central leaders to discuss the construction of the Yellow Emperor Mausoleum in Shaanxi. These are all recent major events related to the nation. The Yellow Emperor is the ancestor of our race. His civil and military achievements built a great nation on the Asian continent. Our people should recognize from history the spirit of hard struggle of our ancestors. The Xinhai Revolution rebuilt the nation. The Prime Minister's ordeal in London was to restore the national spirit. The National Games focuses on physical education and reinvigorates the national spirit. Its significance is very important. If we want to restore the national spirit, we should develop national self-confidence, recognize the spirit of our ancestors in overcoming difficulties, and overcome the environment. Important national figures who can be emulated are the Yellow Emperor, Dayu, Confucius, and other sages, all of whom constantly strived to develop the national spirit. Therefore, we must have sincerity, thoroughly understand, and then have national self-confidence. We must also consolidate the foundation of the nation and establish (1) an educated nation, (2) a healthy nation, (3) a morally upright nation, and (4) a united nation. With a solid foundation and a firm national self-confidence, the national spirit can be developed and glorified. (Ninth, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held its 99th memorial week on the morning of the ninth. Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Zhang Ji, Miao Peicheng, Jiao Yitang, Li Jingzhai, Li Zonghuang, Xie Zuomin, Hong Ludong, Xiao Jishan, and a total of over 600 staff members attended. Chairman Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. Zhang Ji reported on the topic of "The Rate of National Extinction and its Relief," stating that in recent years, the rural population has been declining, and there is a phenomenon of land without people, especially in the rural areas of the northwestern provinces. The reasons are nothing more than banditry, natural disasters, and plagues, leading to rural bankruptcy. In particular, the scourge of opium and heroin among the people has had an even greater impact, not only reducing the population in numbers but also making the national physique unhealthy in reality. The image of extinction is imminent. We should urgently provide relief. Revitalizing the countryside is the only good way to save the country. The foundation of the countryside lies in the family, so we should strongly maintain this inherent organization and use political power to give the countryside the right to self-defense, so that it has the ability to revive the countryside and deal with evil. After the village is peaceful and the countryside is safe, all policies to save the country can be promoted without hindrance. (Ninth, Central News Agency)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Australian government began to implement reduced preferential tariffs for the British Empire on the fifth. On one hand, Article 8 of the Industrial Protection Act formulated in 1921 was revised into a bill imposing special tax rates on imports from countries with falling exchange rates, which was submitted to the Federal Parliament on the fifth. Thus, the British Empire's attitude of economic blockade has been completely formed. In addition to India, New Zealand, British Africa, British West Indies and other British territories, Dutch India, and the United States, which is attempting to suppress Japanese goods by implementing the Industrial Control Act, Australia has been added, and various countries are gradually echoing the trend of blockading Japanese goods in overseas markets. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry considers the situation to be serious and will decide to establish a new trade policy, enter the world market, and observe the progress of the Simla Conference. Currently, Vice Minister Yoshino is at the center, conducting consultations with relevant bureaus. After a full ministerial meeting will be held soon, private practitioners will be separately convened to hold trade roundtables between officials and civilians. The opening of the South and Central American market development roundtable, which will be held tomorrow, is its first step. Officials and civilians attach great importance to this.

<p>Simla. The Indo-Japanese conference is merely exploring each other's opinions. It is reported that Frank Noyce, the representative of the Indian government, lamented, "How can we endure holding meetings every other day like this?" The Indian committee hopes to conclude the conference as soon as possible and wants to end the conference by the end of the parliamentary term on the 13th of next month.

<p>Simla. The Indian government today formally requested the Japanese delegation, saying that the Indian parliament is about to open, and the Indian delegation will return to Delhi from Simla on the 20th. It requested that the Indo-Japanese negotiations be held there from the 23rd. Japan has no objection to the change of negotiation location. As a result, the Simla meeting will be suspended until the 20th, and then moved to Delhi. (Eighth, Electric Communication)</p>
<p>Simla. The Japanese delegation will continue to hold meetings on the ninth, so although yesterday was Sunday, it still gathered to discuss countermeasures. Observing India's attitude to date, it clearly wants to obtain Japan's commitment regarding the control of other miscellaneous goods imports while negotiating the cotton cloth issue. Although Japan will reject this on the grounds that the control of Japanese goods is impossible, if India re-requests the export control of Japanese goods, Japan will take a step back and reply that the control of Japanese goods will be considered. However, the items cannot be listed one by one due to various reasons. Today, industry representatives held a meeting in the morning to discuss countermeasures. (Ninth, Electric Communication)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was quite pessimistic about the Indo-Japanese talks in Simla at first. However, after the negotiations began, the connection between Britain and India was not prepared, and the situation was not unfavorable to Japan. According to information received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the interests of Indian capital and British capital still conflict. Therefore, India is not subject to British control.

<p>(Tokyo) The Five-Minister Conference of Prime Minister Saito, Finance Minister Takahashi, Foreign Minister Hirota, Army Minister Araki, and Navy Minister Osumi will rapidly reach a conclusion. The international coordination and pacifism advocated by Hirota and Takahashi are opposed to the national defense first principle advocated by Araki and Osumi. How will this progress? The fate of the nation is greatly related, and the people are watching the development of the Five-Minister Conference with great attention. The focus of the problem is the issue of new requirements for weapons and equipment by the army. It is doubtful whether the military will accommodate the expenditure of military expenses within the scope of the harmony between finance and national defense held by Finance Minister Takahashi. Army Minister Araki said that the army's new budget request is the minimum requirement necessary to maintain peace in the Far East. How will the Finance Minister and the Army Minister reach a compromise on this point? What kind of strategy will Prime Minister Saito use to reconcile the two is the key to solving the problem. On the other hand, it is widely rumored that Finance Minister Takahashi recognizes the navy's second supplementary plan as unavoidable for national defense and has reached an understanding with Navy Minister Osumi. However, at the same time, Navy Minister Osumi believes that the enhancement of national defense should always be based on the principle of coordination between the army and navy, and the army and navy plans cannot be separated. Therefore, he supports Army Minister Araki's proposal. How will Prime Minister Saito and Finance Minister Takahashi handle the army budget related to the fate of the government and reach a conclusion at the Five-Minister Conference is the focus of interest. Therefore, the next day or two are extremely important. (Ninth, Electric Communication)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Seiyukai attaches great importance to the Five-Minister Conference on handling national policies in times of crisis.

From the perspective of the overall national situation, it cannot be ignored, so it has been consulting on how to deal with the situation for several days. The majority opinion generally advocates pacifism, saying that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations is to maintain peace in the East, as the imperial rescript says. The maintenance of world peace is Japan's fundamental policy. In the future, it will cooperate with various countries to maintain peace. From this meaning, it should avoid conflict with foreign countries. (Ninth, Electric Communication)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) At the speech meeting criticizing the current situation initiated by the Seiyukai at the Hibiya Public Hall today, former Foreign Minister Yoshizawa spoke as follows: Manchuria and the South Seas Islands are lifelines for Japan in terms of national defense and economy. To ensure their security, in my personal opinion, it is necessary to strengthen national defense and adjust diplomacy with the great powers through political work. This point must be given special consideration before 1935. Strengthening national defense is not preparing for war against a specific country, but to prevent war before it happens. What should be considered externally now are countries such as Britain, the United States, Russia, and France. Do not engage in political disputes with these great powers, but since there are seeds of conflict in the economy, it is not only impossible but also unwise to regard all of them as enemies. Therefore, it is necessary to improve relations with at least one or two of them. If this political work and the strengthening of national defense can be completed, then Japan will be safe.

<h3 id="e64">Soviet Russian Government Announces Secret Documents on Japanese Encroachment on the Chinese Eastern Railway; Japanese Consul's Report to the Ambassador to Russia, One Item; Hishikari's Report to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Three Items <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the Soviet Russian government, fulfilling its threat to Japan on the 28th of last month, announced four types of secret documents related to the Chinese Eastern Railway. One is a report from a Japanese consul to the Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Ota, and the other three are said to be reports from the commander of the Kwantung Army, Hishikari, to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. According to a Russian government communique, Hishikari, in one of the reports, discussed seizing the Chinese Eastern Railway, reporting on a plan for a meeting to search the offices of Soviet Russian personnel. The recent arrest of Russian personnel was planned at that meeting. In addition, the other two reports, sent out on the 9th of last month, both reported on the progress of the plan set at that meeting. The plan included summoning creditors of the Eastern Railway to demand repayment. If the railway bureau had no funds to pay, the railway could be occupied in the name of [Manchukuo]. The consul's report to Ambassador Ota detailed another meeting, during which a list of Russian personnel to be arrested was drawn up. The meeting was very secret, and even [Manchukuo] personnel were excluded from attending. Later, another meeting was convened to draw up a second list of Russian personnel to be arrested. How these documents came to the knowledge of the Soviet Russians, the Russian government has not explained. (9th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the TASS News Agency here released the following report: Sokolnikov's statement to the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Ota, on September 21, and Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yu Yin-fu's declaration in Tokyo on September 28, both stated that the Soviet government had obtained official Japanese documents sufficient to prove the responsibility of the Japanese government for the steps taken in Manchuria regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway. TASS is now publishing a portion of these documents. These documents all describe the actions of Japanese military and civilian authorities related to the plan to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway. These documents fully demonstrate Japan's role in the recent developments in Manchuria and refute the official declarations regarding the independence of [Manchukuo], denying the Japanese government's claim that it is no longer involved in the seizure operations conducted under the [Manchukuo flag]. These documents especially show that the arrest of Soviet personnel of the Chinese Eastern Railway was by no means the result of any misconduct on their part but was the beginning of the implementation of their seizure plan. This plan was drafted at a meeting attended by the Japanese military commander and Japanese officials in [Manchukuo]. The documents now published are as follows:</p>
<p>Document No. 1. The first document is entitled "Report of the Japanese Ambassador to [Manchukuo] to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, September 4, 1933." Its content is as follows: "Since the spring of this year, [Manchukuo] has implemented several measures regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway issue. To prevent the removal of the Chinese Eastern Railway's machinery, the Suifenhe station was sealed off. Recently, other measures have been implemented to make the Tokyo negotiations for the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway favorable to our side. [Manchukuo] is unwilling to publicly announce the fact that the purpose of adopting the above steps is to put pressure on the Tokyo negotiations and insists on viewing these steps as purely internal affairs. [Manchukuo], based on this point, requests to insist on the following two points: First, because the Chinese Eastern Railway is within the scope of [Manchukuo]'s authority, [Manchukuo] laws must be enforced and its plans for the railway and its entire organization must be implemented. Second, it firmly refuses to recognize the clauses of the old Russian and Sino-Russian treaties that conflict with the principle of [Manchukuo]'s sovereignty. These clauses are incompatible with the general situation of the Chinese Eastern Railway as a commercial enterprise and the current status of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and therefore cannot be accepted (the above-mentioned points have all been specified in the memorandum submitted by [Manchukuo] in the Tokyo Conference). The following are the concrete steps for implementation when the following items are realized: (1) Insist on reorganizing the Chinese Eastern Railway administration, stipulating stable transportation rates, and changing the gold ruble unit to [Manchukuo] currency, and insist that the director-general's decision on all issues must have the consent of the [Manchukuo] deputy director-general. Any action taken by the director-general without this consent shall be invalid. This declaration must be presented to the Soviet side and urged to implement it. (2) Our police and prison authorities are currently conducting searches and detailed investigations of the activities of communist and communist youth league organizations, labor unions, and other illegal organizations sheltering under the Chinese Eastern Railway. At the same time, resolute steps should be taken to eliminate these organizations according to their nature. Anti-communist movements are being carried out everywhere. For the possible seizure of the railway, the mobilization of railway employees and military police is currently underway, and their experimental distributions are being carried out as initial steps. The status of Soviet personnel of the Chinese Eastern Railway is currently being investigated, and unexpected searches are being conducted on the Chinese Eastern Railway Club and other public organizations. (3) Border conflicts are frequent, and resolute protests should be made to the Soviet side for its illegal actions.</p>
<p>[Furthermore, as reported by Consul-General Xiang, the [Manchukuo] Ministry of Communications has followed this approach and requested in the recent meeting of the Chinese Eastern Railway Board that the powers of the director-general and deputy director-general of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau should be equal. At the same time, it requested that the methods of supervising the work of the Railway Supervisory Committee be sanctioned. On the 25th of last month, a telegram was received from Oohashi, stating that the Tokyo negotiations had been delayed and that he wished to take autonomous coercive steps. Based on this, a meeting was held on the 2nd of this month, attended by Japanese officials (department heads) and military leaders. The embassy was represented by Councilor Denny and Hannaval (both transliterations). The meeting was held in the [Manchukuo State Council]. Due to the arrival of the new director of the Kwantung Region, this meeting discussed concrete plans for future revisions to the steps previously taken regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway. Because the Kwantung Army representative stated that although they agreed with the joint steps, they believed that the use of force was unwise. At the same time, in any case, the agreement of all relevant agencies must be obtained before using force. Councilor Denny stated that [Manchukuo] Japanese officials held a decisive position in this matter and stated that due to the smooth progress of the Tokyo negotiations (the ruble conversion rate has been resolved two months after the meeting, which should be regarded as a positive achievement of the [Manchukuo] side), and considering that Japan would not be in a position to incite conflicts on the mainland by 1935, although the assimilation of the Chinese Eastern Railway is absolutely necessary, he wished to avoid all hasty steps. Denny further pointed out that the measures proposed by the [Manchukuo] Ministry of Communications were a plan for the joint Soviet-Manchukuo administration of the railway.</p>
<p>Document No. 2. The second document is a report from the Japanese Ambassador to Manchukuo to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, dated September 9, 1933. The text is as follows: [The meeting originally scheduled for the 7th of this month was postponed to the 9th and held at the [Manchukuo State Council]. After general discussions, the meeting discussed the specific action plans decided at the meeting held on September 8, attended by a responsible person from the [Manchukuo] Ministry of Communications. Finally, it was unanimously decided that if the military authorities and the Russian Embassy could respectively make detailed reports to the military department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the proposed plan could be implemented. Please reply urgently by telegram, expressing your opinion on the above points, especially on the first part of the fourth paragraph. If a large-scale police search and arrest of key personnel is required, another preliminary meeting must be held. The second part of the plan is difficult to implement, so it will also be discussed when appropriate and to the extent possible. At the same time, the fifth part of the plan must be carried out after preliminary investigation.] Hishikari (signature)</p>
<p>Document No. 3. The third document is another report from the Japanese Ambassador to Manchukuo to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo, dated September 9, 1933. Its content is as follows: [In order to promote negotiations for the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the following steps have been decided: Utilize the Chinese Eastern Railway Auditing Department and other agencies to collect materials on the illegal actions of Soviet personnel of the railway and submit them to the executive office and the police bureau for investigation. To achieve this objective, first, the Auditing Department must be allowed to collect such materials and conduct investigations. First, the chairman of the board, the councilor, the director-general of the administration, and the chief auditor should all be summoned for questioning with considerable material warrants. Third, in order to constitute this action, the defendants should be examined and, if necessary, arrested. Fourth, sufficient attention should be paid to avoid giving an incorrect impression of the widespread police search. The scale of the search during planning will be very small, and arrests will only be applied to lower-level employees, but the scope may be expanded during the investigation period, and important employees may also be arrested (the above items will be carried out in cooperation with the [Ministry of Justice], the police, and the Chinese Eastern Railway Executive Department). [(2) The Manchukuo Ministry of Communications issued an instruction to the chairman of the Chinese Eastern Railway Board that all actions and orders of the director-general of the administration must henceforth have the consent of the deputy director-general. If this regulation is not complied with, the chairman of the board should be regarded as acting illegally and such unofficial instructions should be suspended, and the criminal aspects should be investigated. The chairman of the board should notify the board of directors and department heads of the above items. The Ministry of Communications] recently instructed the chairman of the board, instructing on the legislation of tariff issues, equality of railway employees, and other issues (this item must be implemented by the Railway Administration Department). (3) Investigate the industries, residences, arrival purposes, and passports of Soviet citizens in Harbin and the Chinese Eastern Railway area, and investigate Harbin Commercial School and the clubs along the Chinese Eastern Railway. At the same time, strict control should be exercised over other communist organizations (executed by the Police Department). (4) Verify the regular tax expenditures and various activities of the Far Eastern Bank and the Chinese Eastern Railway Consumer Cooperative. [The Ministry of Finance] Supervision Division and the Customs Office, in order to complete this objective, must summon responsible representatives of these Soviet agencies and review their books and documents (executed by the [Ministry of Finance]). (5) A plan should be made to force the creditors of the Chinese Eastern Railway to demand payment from the railway. If this results in the seizure of the railway's property, a broad meeting should be held before proceeding to discuss the progress of negotiations with the creditors and to discuss which industries they are willing to seize (this matter will be jointly executed by the [Ministry of Justice and the [Railway Administrative Department]). (6) White Russians who have been imprisoned since the Sino-Soviet conflict in 1929 and who have not yet been released should be interrogated and released publicly and promptly (executed by the [Ministry of Justice]). (7) In implementing the above steps, special attention should be paid to the following points: (A) The above steps should be implemented quickly. (B) When implementing, it should be expressed as having no connection with the Tokyo negotiations and as promoting the domestic steps taken by the [Manchukuo government]. (C) Special attention should be paid to maintaining strict secrecy and making every effort to prevent the above steps from being leaked. (D) The directors of the Police Department, the Department of Justice, and the Railway Administration Department, and other leading officials, should all come to Harbin from time to time to urge the continuous implementation of the plan. (E) At the same time, maintain contact with the [Manchukuo] agencies in Harbin and maintain close contact with the Japanese military delegation stationed in Harbin, and from there maintain relations with the Japanese troops and Japanese military police in northern Manchuria. (F) The implementation status of the above items should be reported to [Manchukuo Ministry of Interior] and other relevant agencies.] Hishikari (signature).</p>
<p>Document No. 4. The fourth document is a report from the Japanese Consul-General in Harbin to the Japanese Ambassador to Manchukuo, dated September 19. The text is as follows: [Today (September 19), [Police Department] Director Nagao (Japanese transliteration, Ministry of Justice, Director Guretama (Japanese transliteration)] Ministry of Communications Representative Morita and Japanese and Manchu agencies in Harbin, other officials (excluding Manchu officials) met at the residence of the Japanese military delegation to discuss the implementation of the steps listed in your telegram, and it was decided that these would all be implemented using local legislation. A. (1) Regarding the first paragraph opened in your telegram, it has been decided that in the middle of this month, the six people responsible for removing the vehicles and the one person convicted of illegally spending railway funds will be arrested and imprisoned, namely (1) Chief of the Secret Service Karina, (2) Locomotive Storage Director Raiflov, (3) Vehicle Department Director Ablov, (4) Manchouli Locomotive Storage Director Nishisun Sisko, (5) Manchouli Station Master Abboveimenko, (6) Suifenhe Station Master Katier. (2) The Chinese Eastern Railway Auditing Department will send the above-mentioned criminals to the court for consultation. (3) Personnel at Manchouli and Suifenhe stations should be arrested by the military and border guards and escorted to Harbin. All arrested personnel will be tried in Harbin. (4) Organize an executive committee to preside over this action. (5) When implementing the above actions, all news can only be reported by the Police Department, and no interference from newspapers or publicity personnel or private individuals is allowed. (6) Weapons may be used immediately in the event of resistance or destructive actions during arrests. (7) After the investigation is completed, the Chinese Eastern Railway Auditing Department should conduct the second batch of arrests. B. To avoid requesting instructions from the central government to miss opportunities, the detailed methods for each individual case can be drafted locally. C. The third paragraph opened in your telegram will be implemented between October 10 and 15 following the implementation of the first paragraph of the telegram.] Morishima (signature)</p>

<p>(Harbin) Today, the Harbin Times, a Japanese-run newspaper here, published an article arguing that the [Manchukuo] representatives should immediately withdraw from the Chinese Eastern Railway Conference currently convened in Tokyo. The newspaper stated that the policies and actions currently taken by the Soviet Russians due to the detention of Chinese Eastern Railway Russian personnel are absolutely wrong and cannot be tolerated. This is sufficient to prove that Soviet Russia is not friendly to Manchukuo, while Manchukuo's policies towards Russia are entirely aimed at peace. The report also stated that Manchukuo has its own reasons for wanting to seize the management rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway and claimed that if it had this intention, it could be implemented at any time, because [Manchukuo] is too tolerant and lacks a firm policy. Manchukuo only wants to establish a legal and correct joint administration of the Chinese Eastern Railway, but Soviet Russia deliberately distorts it. Now that Soviet Russia has no sincerity, Manchukuo has no need to continue to maintain a friendly policy with Russia, which disregards all principles and morality. The Manchu representatives participating in the Chinese Eastern Railway Conference in Tokyo should immediately withdraw, and negotiations should be stopped. Please ask the Manchu authorities to transform the current theoretical policy into a firm and hardline policy. However, any incidents that occur as a result of this should be borne by Soviet Russia.

<h3 id="e67">No Hope for Franco-German Reconciliation; Extremely Pessimistic Prospects for Disarmament; France Unwilling to Easily Allow German Military Equality; German Demands Threaten the European Political Situation; Can the Final Contacts Save the Dangerous Situation? <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The representatives of the five countries, Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Germany, all hope that after today's meeting of the Disarmament Main Committee, private talks will be reopened immediately, hoping to find a compromise between the opposing positions of France and Germany on the issue of supervising armaments. As for today's Main Committee, it is expected to only go through the motions as usual, because France and Germany have no intention of compromising on any important point. Although Germany can accept the supervision of armaments by an international neutral commission, it makes it a condition that it obtains complete military equality. France is unwilling to easily allow such equality and reduce its own armaments until it is deeply convinced that Germany is completely peaceful. The attitudes of both sides show no sign of change. In addition, the Americans also believe that Germany's demands, even if they do not affect the world's political situation, will threaten the European political situation. Therefore, the pessimism of the general public regarding the Disarmament Conference is unprecedented since its opening. It is now expected that after a few formal committee meetings, there will be several private meetings of representatives. However, according to the situation in recent days, the hope of saving the overall situation is very slim. It is said that the French representatives also feel that Germany has no other way to go in the current environment except to put forward such unacceptable demands, because Hitler's plan has not made satisfactory progress domestically, and there must be some drastic actions to divert people's attention from internal to external affairs. Although, according to the current situation, if a compromise cannot be found that is acceptable to France and Germany, the disarmament agreement may still adjourn without any results. (9th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Berlin) When the German delegation led by Nadolny departed for Geneva today, it issued a statement summarizing Germany's disarmament policy, stating that Germany would never sign any convention that did not want the fundamental principle of equality. Germany does not want to increase its armaments, but only wants to reorganize its national defense forces. Germany does not demand that France's armaments be equal to Germany's after five years, but only asks that other countries continue to disarm. Germany is prepared to declare what it is willing to do when other powers earnestly announce what types of weapons they intend to abandon and retain. (8th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden and French Foreign Minister Pongu met again and informed Pongu of the talks he had with German representative Nadolny and American representative Davis yesterday. This shows that Eden's attitude towards the disarmament issue is fundamentally the same as that of the French delegation and has not changed. The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference will resume work on the 16th of this month. When the Presidium meets this afternoon, it will probably maintain the original proposal. When the General Committee meets at that time, it is feared that diplomatic talks between countries will also be held at the same time. If so, the work of the Disarmament Conference itself may be limited to purely technical issues, at least for the first few days. (9th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>(New York) According to news from Geneva, German representative to the Disarmament Conference, Nadolny, had asked American representative Davis to mediate between the representatives of France and Germany to discuss the disarmament issue. American officials were very pleased to hear this news. Washington believes that this meeting may enable Germany and France to reach a friendly agreement on the disarmament issue. (9th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) The Morning Post reported that when the British Cabinet meets this afternoon, it will change its policy so that Germany can no longer use it as an excuse to insist on its current demands. If Germany still refuses to revise its demands despite this British concession, then a disarmament compromise will be completely hopeless. This situation will then be announced at the Disarmament Conference, and the judgment of the world will be heard. (9th National Telegraph)</p>
<h3 id="e68">American Recovery Movement Has Reached a Critical Juncture; Commerce Gradually Improving <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The National Movement for Immediate Purchase begins today, and the people of the country are paying close attention to it. Director of the Executive Office, General Johnson, and others believe that if this movement fails, the National Recovery Movement will collapse. The Business Weekly claims that construction activities have expanded and demand for textiles has recovered, but coal and steel production has been hit by labor unrest. The Ikonsdai reports that commerce has reached a turning point and can now resume the progress that was interrupted in late July. For this reason, this new movement should be hopeful. It is widely expected that President Roosevelt will approve a reduction in the gold content of the US dollar without creating currency inflation. It is expected that President Luo will revise the guarantee law to allow the private capital market to reopen. (8th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Financial Rehabilitation Plan released an article stating that by September 30 of this year, the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation had paid out a total of $309.7 million and recovered $87.9 million. A total of $227.3 million had been given to banks and trust companies, and $84.1 million had been repaid. Loans secured by agricultural products totaled $12.1 million, and loans for relief purposes totaled $45 million. (9th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) At this time, conservative elements in the United States are advising the US President to make it clear that he will not issue record-backed banknotes (that is, inconvertible paper money) or devalue gold again. However, according to external rumors, the US President is trying to use the atmosphere of currency inflation to threaten bankers and industrialists, forcing them to fully cooperate with the government's credit expansion plan. Capitalists have told the government that they are unwilling to lend to various industries unless they are sure what kind of currency they will receive when their future debts are due. Several well-known bankers have also claimed that they believe the Federal Reserve is planning to fill the banks with liquid funds so that they can be happy to lend. Although they do not approve of this move, they expect the Federal Reserve's purchase of public bonds to increase to $200 million per week. Those close to the President said that the President insists that he does not want to easily use the power of currency inflation until the credit expansion plan has been pushed to the limit. After investigating the domestic credit situation today, it is expected that the credit expansion plan will continue to be promoted next month. However, if there is still no major progress in industry and commerce by the end of next month, the currency inflation faction will jointly demand that the government issue paper money or silver coins.

<p>Hungarian Capital. The kings of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria met a few days ago. Therefore, outside rumours are circulating that Bulgaria may join the Little Entente. Recently, a reporter from [Monday Newspaper] here interviewed Bulgarian Prime Minister Muchanov. According to Mr. Muchanov's declaration, the Bulgarian government believes that the time has not yet come for the country to join the Little Entente or the Turkish-Bulgarian Group. (9th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) The close cooperation plan for South European countries determined by the Little Entente at the meeting in Silesia is now actively underway, and the monarchs of Chu are also involved.

<p>(Guangzhou) Guangzhou is now preparing to launch a political bombshell, demanding 190 million yuan from Nanjing to settle the military expenses borrowed for the Northern Expedition in the 15th year of the Republic, on which the National Government was founded. Guangzhou suggests that this sum should be allocated from the US Cotton and Wheat Loan of 50 million US dollars. It is said that in the 15th year of the Republic, approximately 80 million yuan in national currency was drawn from the Guangzhou Central Bank and issued in three installments of Changsi public bonds, as well as two installments of short-term public bonds, to supply the expenses of the Northern Expedition. In addition, there were special housing donations of approximately 110 million yuan. The people of Guangzhou believe that their vitality has not yet recovered from the purchase of public bonds and the payment of special donations, and that 190 million yuan is needed to offset the debt. Therefore, they will now make this request and use this sum for the Three-Year Plan for South China. The National Government should allocate a portion of the US debt to Guangzhou without hesitation. The portion requested exceeds the US debt itself by 20 million yuan in national currency, but Guangzhou has not paid attention to this point. (Reuters dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>Premier Wang Convened a Tea Party</p>
<h3 id="e74">Discussion of the Inner Mongolia Autonomy Issue; Mongolian Residents in Beijing Express Welcome for Huang and Zhao's Trip North; Various Leagues and Banners of Inner Mongolia Support the Party and the Nation <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy, Premier Wang convened an important tea party a few days ago, attended by over 100 Mongolian residents in Beijing. He also invited Examination Yuan President Dai Chuanxian, Judicial Yuan President Ju Zheng, Central Secretary-General Ye Chucang, Central Committee Member Zhang Ji, Deputy Chief of Staff Huang Musong, Interior Minister Huang Shaoxiong, and Mongolian Affairs Commission Deputy Chairman Zhao Pilian to accompany him. Chu Minyi, Qingyang, Chen Rui, and others were responsible for the reception. Wang delivered a speech, first stating the Central Government's attitude towards Inner Mongolia's request for autonomy this time, then hoping that the Mongolians would uphold the spirit of the Five Races Republic and not be deceived by foreigners. He also stated that in recent years, they have suffered internal communist disasters and external aggression, resulting in the suffering of the Mongolian people being overlooked, and he expressed deep apologies. The mission of sending high-ranking officials this time is to declare the Central Government's true attitude towards Mongolia and to assist in the construction of its government. He requested the Mongolian residents present to express their opinions for the government's reference. Subsequently, Presidents Dai and Ju, Shi, Huang, and others delivered sincere speeches. Mongolian residents Bai Yunti and Wu Queqing successively expressed their opinions, expressing welcome for Huang and Zhao's visit. After the tea party, Huang Shaoxiong said that after the Inner Mongolia autonomy issue arose this time, the Central Government immediately dispatched him and Deputy Chairman Zhao to convey condolences, which he cannot refuse. However, before going to Mongolia, it is necessary to finalize military, diplomatic, and internal affairs plans to have a basis after arriving in Mongolia. His task this time is to uphold the Central Government's intentions, in addition to conveying condolences and guidance, and to take the opportunity to investigate the situation in Mongolia in detail and formulate a permanent plan as the basis for governing Mongolia. He will be able to depart within a week. Zhao Pilian stated that the departure date has not yet been determined. Once preparations are complete, they will take the Beijing-Tianjin train and transfer to Zhangjiakou. In addition to three or four officials from the Ministry of Interior and the Mongolian Affairs Commission, the Organization Committee will also send two people who are proficient in the Mongolian language to assist. Zhang Ji said, (1) Inner Mongolia is located on the border of our country and is easily influenced by the outside world. The first thing to do is to investigate the internal motives to determine the direction. (2) The Central Government has now decided to send Huang and Zhao to convey condolences and must give them practical benefits, not just empty words, in order to win people's hearts. (3) In the future, special attention must be paid to all construction in Mongolia. (Special Dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Heling and five other representatives of various leagues and banners of Mongolia stationed in Beijing went to the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 9th to visit Premier Wang and presented various telegrams from Mongolia that had arrived in Beijing. One of the telegrams was led by the leader of the Xilingol League and sent from the Belle Temple on the 8th via the Panchen Lama's radio station, stating that over 30 representatives from various leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia have gathered at the Belle Temple and plan to hold a meeting, including words of supporting the Party and the nation and seeking autonomy. They hoped that the Central Government would send personnel to lead them as soon as possible, proving that rumors of Mongolians defecting and resisting the Central Government were not true. The Panchen Lama's office in Beijing recently received a telegram stating that he has left Bailing Temple and is going to the Yeke-juu League to lecture on Buddhist scriptures.

<p>China's Ban on Opium is Unceasing; Japan Cannot Shirk Responsibility; Detailed Discussion in British Newspapers</p>
<p>(London) The [Manchester Guardian] published an article commenting on the League of Nations' report on opium trafficking, stating that Japan seems to bear the greatest responsibility for the development of drug trafficking. The newspaper also stated that, in addition to Japan, other powers with land interests in China cannot shirk their responsibility, but Japan occupies a particularly advantageous position in this matter. The ["Manchukuo"] has implemented a state monopoly on opium, but it has no relationship with the international narcotics conventions and is not bound by them. There are also endless reserves of raw soil that can be used to manufacture large quantities of morphine and heroin for smuggling into other parts of China. The domestic opium consumption in Japan is far greater than in other countries, but the number of Japanese people who use narcotics is not more than in other countries. This is well known. From this point of view, it is clear that Japan must be transshipping large quantities of opium soil into China. As for China, there is no doubt that it has good intentions and wants to eliminate the sale of narcotics, but it is not easy for the Chinese government to fight against Japan's threat.

<p>Zhang Ji Delivers a Speech Emphasizing Public Service and Law Abidance</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The newly appointed members of the Control Yuan's Supervisory Committee, Hu Boyue, Wang Guangqing, Zhang Hualan, Wang Xianzhang, and Duan Honggang, as well as Director of the National Government's Bureau of Statistics Wu Dajun, took the oath of office at the National Government on the morning of the 9th. Chairman Lin Sen and Central Committee Member Zhang Ji served as witnesses and performed the ceremony. First, Zhang Ji delivered a speech, briefly stating that in recent years, due to the efforts of the Control Yuan and the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the country has gradually become more orderly. However, it is impossible for everything to be perfect and orderly at the beginning of the founding of the nation. He hoped that things would get better day by day and progress daily, so that the supervisory and management work of the Control Yuan and the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics would enable everyone to abide by the law and fulfill their duties, so the responsibility is very important. Furthermore, there is a distinction between the heavenly nobility and the human nobility. The human nobility is based on a person's rank and position to determine their status, but the heavenly nobility has no class. For example, if one is a public official and can abide by the law and fulfill their duties, their heavenly nobility is very high and they can become a sage, which is incomparable to those who rely on power and do not abide by the law, whom the world often calls "beyond the law." Subsequently, Chairman Lin delivered a speech, generally stating that the work of the Control Yuan and the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics is actually two but one, and that everyone must be able to serve the public and abide by the law and must not engage in corruption and malfeasance. The people should not be wronged or oppressed, and those who enforce the law should abide by the law, so that the country will be stable and society will be stable, and the national economy and the people's livelihood will benefit. Finally, the representatives of the Supervisory Committee, Wang Guangqing, and the Director of the Bureau of Statistics, Wu Dajun, gave their replies successively, and the ceremony concluded and dispersed.

<h3 id="e76">Gu Zhutong and Others Bid Farewell to the Elders of Jiangsu Province <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Jiangsu Chairman Gu Zhutong and the department heads and committee members sent a letter on the 9th to bid farewell to the elders of Jiangsu Province. (Titles omitted) Zhutong and others were humble and mediocre and were entrusted with important tasks to serve Jiangsu Province for nearly six years. At the time of taking office, it was immediately after the flood disaster, with devastation everywhere and empty treasuries. We planned urgent relief and repaired the Yun Canal dikes and the sea embankment project. Looking back, we planned simultaneously, and our minds and efforts were exhausted. Then, the January 28th Incident occurred, and the national army fought hard, and rumors frequently startled us. Zhenjiang was close to the capital, and we were responsible for constructing defense works north and south, consolidating the rear, and maintaining security with great difficulty, and we were fortunate to avoid failure. However, since the flood disaster and the national crisis, the people of Jiangsu Province have been exhausted and their vitality has been greatly damaged. All new constructions have been halted due to lack of funds. Zhutong and others served their hometown and respected their homeland. They worked hard and diligently and dared not slack off in the slightest. They actively promoted clearing up officialdom, reforming administration, suppressing bandits, reducing expenses, and seeking development and dared not leave any effort unused. However, due to difficult circumstances, obstacles arose, and our hearts were more than enough, but our strength was insufficient, and things did not go as we wished, and there has been little success in the past two years. We believe that our virtue is thin and our ability is lacking, which cannot help the current difficulties. Continuing in this way will only cause mistakes. We have neither repaid the Central Government's heavy trust nor met the elders' expectations. We have been unable to sleep or eat in peace and feel deeply guilty. Therefore, we have jointly requested to resign and retreat to the path of the worthy, and we are fortunate to have been approved, which will reduce our guilt. We have received an order to take on the work of suppressing bandits in the five northern provinces, and we are preparing to set off with our weapons and move west with our banners furled. We cherish the sound of your virtue and deeply regret it. However, Zhutong and others are from Jiangsu, and our homeland is of utmost importance, and we have a responsibility for its rise and fall. From now on, for all local projects in this province, we will still do our best as a member of Jiangsu and follow in the footsteps of the elders to work together to save the situation. As the telegram rushes, we ask for your attention. Gu Zhutong, Zhao Qi [blank], Shu Shifu, Zhou Fohai, Dong Xiujia, Han Deqin, He Yutang, Wang Boling, and Li Mingyang, respectfully kowtow.

<p>Fang Ji Contacts Tang Yulin's Troops</p>
<p>Tangshan Falls, War Escalates, Battle at Mafang</p>
<p>Various Armies Plan Encirclement and Attack</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang's troops reached Ming Tombs and Erdaoguan a few days ago, opening a path to contact Tang Yulin and Liu Guitang's troops. Tang's troops then took the Erdaoguan route from Yongning Town in Chahar Province and entered the Great Wall. Wang Ying also led more than a thousand men to join Fang's army. Tang's troops have many mountain guns and mortars, as well as more than twenty light and heavy machine guns. The military equipment is complete. It is said that Tang himself has also entered the Great Wall, but his whereabouts are still unknown. With the addition of this fresh force, Fang Ji's momentum has gradually increased. On the 3rd of this month, he launched a fierce attack on Changping, but failed. He then advanced south from the mountains northeast of Changping and counterattacked Tangshan and Gaoliying. On the 5th, the troops attacking Gaoliying suddenly arrived near Gaoliying and occupied the villages of Dadongliu and Xiaodongliu. Another detachment of plainclothes soldiers sneaked to Lishuiqiao. Wan Fulins' troops, Zhou Fucheng's division, and Zhao Jingmin's regiment stationed in Gaoliying abandoned Gaoliying because they were attacked from both the front and the rear. Later, reinforcements arrived and encircled them from the left and right wings, forming an arc-shaped line. Fang Ji, fearing encirclement, did not dare to go deep and continued to hold Dadongliu and Xiaodongliu. On the 6th, Zhou's division and Zhao's regiment counterattacked Fang Ji, advanced to Gao Kaiying and expanded westward. Today (the 7th), the Fang side entered a state of truce, and the two sides are in a standoff in the Dadongliu area. The Tangshan area is defended by Wan's troops, Zhu Hongxun's division, and Zhao's regiment. On the 5th, Fang Ji, Tang, Wang and other troops attacked Tangshan in separate routes from Xingshou and Qincheng. After a day of fierce fighting, Datangshan, Hulu River, and Daliushu were successively captured by Fang Ji. On the morning of the 6th at 7 o'clock, Zhu's division launched a fierce attack on Daliushu and Hulu River from Xiaotangshan and Mafang. After two hours of fierce fighting, Fang Ji began to retreat across the Hulu River and confronted Zhu's division across the river. At about 11 o'clock, Fang Ji mobilized a large number of reinforcements from Xingshou and Daxinzhuang to launch a counterattack. The artillery fire was extremely fierce. After fierce fighting until about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, most of the villages in the defense area of Zhu's division were destroyed by artillery fire. At 3 o'clock, Fang Ji again pressed on Zhu's division's left wing and sneaked to the rear. A certain regiment on the left wing retreated to Baishe Village due to too many casualties, and the battle temporarily stopped. At about 7 o'clock, the main force of Fang Ji launched a fierce attack on Xiaotangshan, and sent more than a hundred cavalry to raid Zhu's division's rear. Zhu's division's rear force was weak. After fierce fighting until 1 o'clock this morning (the 7th), Xiaotangshan fell, and Zhu's division retreated to the Mafang and Baishe Village areas south of Tangshan, waiting for reinforcements to attack. Fang Ji's troops, also exhausted after several days and nights of fierce fighting, rested and did not advance for the time being. Xiaotangshan is a famous scenic spot in northern Hebei, and the streets are still quite prosperous. There are several grain stores. After Fang Ji entered Xiaotangshan, he requisitioned food, which was enough for a month's supply. Now Fang Ji occupies an area of about fifteen li from north to south and more than twenty li from east to west in the Xiaodongliu, Shanglangou, Xialangou, Dafurenzhuang, Xiaofurenzhuang, Zhaocun, Niufang Caoxinzhuang, Hulu River, Daliushu, Xiaotangshan, Daxinzhuang, Xingshou, Qincheng, and Nieshanying areas around Tangshan and Gaoliying. From Ming Tombs northward, along the border of the war zone, there is still a line of communication to Chahar Province. Fang Ji and Ji Hongchang are currently commanding the armies in Nieshanying, while Wang Ying leads his troops stationed in Qincheng. Today, it is snowing in Zhangjiakou, and the weather in northern Hebei is suddenly cold. With wind and rain, Fang Ji is actively building fortifications along Xiaodongliu, Xiaofurenzhuang, Caoxinzhuang Daliushu to Xiaotangshan, and has not advanced south, only sending outposts to probe the opponent's positions. It is reported that since Zhu's division lost Tangshan, the positions have changed slightly. A new and strong position has been set up from Gaoliying in the east along Xiaodongliu, Xialangou, Mafang, Xuan Niufang, Lengkeng, and Baishe Village to Changping, planning to encircle Fang Ji. The defense area from Nankou to Changping is under the responsibility of Huang Jie's Second Division. The area from Gaoliying to Mafang south of Tangshan is under the responsibility of Wan Fulins' troops. Guan Linzheng's division is responsible for the rear, and Zheng Mingxin's regiment of the main force stationed in Beiyuan has been ordered to defend north of Taipingzhuang today. The area east of Gaoliying is under the responsibility of Shang Zhen's troops to prevent Fang Ji's troops from heading east. Fang Ji once sent a letter to Wan Fulins asking for a leave of absence to suppress bandits, but Wan replied and refused. However, Fang also telegraphed He Yingqin, expressing his willingness to leave the army and go abroad, and sent personnel to negotiate surrender. His intention seems to be to delay the army. It is said that He also ignores him. (October 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e113">Sichuan Bandits Capture Sanhui <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Qu Guangshun Declares Martial Law in Qu County</p>
<p>Liu Xiang Increases Taxes and Claims to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Chongqing News: The Red bandits in northern Sichuan are extremely frightened because various armies are publicizing large-scale suppression campaigns. In order to take the initiative, they have dispatched bandit teams to harass various places, attempting to expand the bandit area so they can hold on to it. After the bandit hordes captured Yilong, they actively harassed the counties under Shunqing jurisdiction. Yingshan, which borders Yilong, bore the brunt. When Nanbu was in crisis a few days ago, it was once rumored that the county seat of Yingshan had fallen, but the authorities later confirmed that the news was inaccurate. However, the bandit hordes were indeed actively harassing Yingshan, Qu County, Shunqing, and Pengxi. It is reported that Sanhui Town, which belongs to Qu County and is ninety li away from Qu County, has been captured by the Red bandits. Qu Guangshun has declared martial law, and the people are extremely frightened. At the same time, the Red bandit plainclothes team was also found at Jiangkou in front of Yingshan. Yang Hanzhong's brigade of Yang Sens' 20th Army has now mobilized heavy troops in the Yuejia Temple area to prevent the bandits from going south along the Ba River. Shunqing and Pengxi also felt the greatest threat because Sanhui Town was occupied by the Red bandits, and at the same time declared martial law. Yang Lin returned to defend the province on the 6th after receiving urgent telegrams from various counties, and planned to block the bandits. It is also reported that before the Red bandits captured Sanhui, the defense of Yingpeng line was under the responsibility of Li Chaoxin's Second Mixed Brigade of the 20th Army. When the Red bandits came to attack, Li returned to Guang'an to ask for instructions on suppressing the bandits and was not at the front line. Moreover, the defense line was extended for hundreds of miles, and the defenses were not in place, so the bandits captured the important town of Qu County. The losses of Li's troops were very heavy. More than 300 dead soldiers have been buried, more than 200 wounded, and about 1,000 were scattered and did not return to the team. The number of officers killed or wounded totaled 40 to 50, and the loss of guns was more than two battalions. More than 300,000 rounds of ammunition were consumed. The people in the Yingpeng area, which are close to Yilong, are deeply afraid that their local area will become a continuation of Tongjiang and Bazhong because they see that the bandit forces are rampant and the government army is not easy to resist. Tens of thousands of people flee every day, especially women, the elderly, the weak, and young children. There is nothing more heartbreaking and tragic than this. As for the various armies, although they preach suppression campaigns every day and send troops to suppress the bandits, up to now, no actual action has been seen from various units. The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of bandit suppression, Liu Xiang, returned to the province by special train from his hometown of Dayi on the 2nd to take office. The original date was set for the 1st, but it was later changed to the 4th. Today (the 4th), the 21st Army Headquarters specifically ordered the Chongqing Garrison Command to inform the people of the whole city to hang flags to celebrate Liu Xiang's inauguration. Liu once said to others that after he took office, he would issue a general mobilization order to suppress the bandits within two or three days. Regarding the military expenses for suppressing the bandits, the total amount set by Liu was 4 million. The fundraising method is to add 10% to the tax amount of various goods in the garrison area of each army in addition to raising donations. After collecting the money, it will be submitted to the Governor's Office for unified distribution. Liu Xiang has yesterday issued an order to all county tax authorities in Sichuan, uniformly limiting the collection of additional taxes from October 1st, and Zhou Shixun ordered the county magistrates of various counties to be responsible for persuading wealthy gentry to donate, and to pay in three installments in mid-October, mid-November, and mid-December. But I don’t know whether Liu Xiang can quickly suppress the bandits after receiving this huge sum of money. (October, date unknown)</p>

Shen pursued them with his gun, and the Water Patrol Team also dispatched a team to the scene after receiving the report. In the darkness, they fired guns until they met at the Huangpu Bund. At first, the Water Patrol Team did not know that Shen was a detective and surrounded Shen. Later, the detectives and patrol officers successively proved Shen's identity. Then, the victim suddenly reported to the county government that Shen Guichang was suspected of being a bandit, and the witnesses were transferred to the court for investigation. Today (the 9th), the Criminal Tribunal interrogated the victims Xue Guirong, Xue Shichang, and Han Liansheng about the theft. The judge asked if any of the bandits sounded like a detective. Then, the judge interrogated the witness Wang Weiqing, who testified that he was drinking tea with Shen at Changshou Garden at about 9 pm on the night of the incident. The witness Wu Rongsheng testified that he personally saw Detective Shen carrying a gun to catch the thieves. When the judge interrogated Shen Guichang, Shen claimed that he was framed. The judge said that the case still needs to be investigated and ordered to return. The judge will be summoned for further interrogation.</p>

Han Wentai was strangled to death on April 27th of the lunar calendar, and the body was hidden in Yequandong by the river. On June 31st, Wu Zhirong, the chief of political affairs of the county government, arrested Yang Abaobao and Zhou Shungen, and recovered the body. The detective team of the County Public Security Bureau arrested Li Zhiping, Jiang Hanchen, Yuan Yonghe and others in Shanghai. The prosecutor Ren, who was in charge of this case at the County Court, came to Wuxi from the First Special District Court in Shanghai to conduct multiple court hearings. Now the investigation has been completed. Li Zhiping committed the acts of kidnapping and extorting ransom, and conspiring with three or more people to break into a residence at night, forcibly seize property, and injure one person. Jiang Hanchen committed the acts of helping to kidnap and extort ransom, intentional homicide, and abandoning a corpse, which constituted the crime of punishing bandits.

<p>Zhang Shimian, a prisoner in the Wu County Local Prison who had already been sentenced, was sentenced to one year in prison for false accusation. After the prisoner was imprisoned, he became ill with worry and occasionally suffered from mental illness. The prison officials had presented a request for bail to be released for treatment. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 7th, when the prisoners were opening the prison well room to fetch water for washing, Zhang Shimian took advantage of the guards' unpreparedness and broke into the well room and threw himself into the well to commit suicide. After the guards discovered this, they ran to inform the prison officials, who tried to retrieve him, but he had already died. They immediately submitted a report requesting the County Court and the County Government to send personnel to examine the body. Yang Kongyi, the chief prosecutor, led his staff to inspect the body on the morning of the 8th. The County Government also sent personnel to accompany the inspection and summoned the guards and prisoners for questioning.

It was destroyed and rebuilt several times during the Yuan and Ming Dynasties. Until this year, it had been in disrepair for a long time, and the pagoda was tilted, with dangerous signs of collapse. Last year, the municipal government initiated the establishment of a repair committee and raised donations. Shi Liangcai, Du Yuesheng, and Zhang Xiaolin from Shanghai each donated more than 20,000 yuan. The shortfall was used to borrow more than 12,000 yuan from the donation for rebuilding the Leifeng Pagoda. The construction started and was completed in four months, with a total project cost of 38,274 yuan.

<p>Completion of the New Municipal Building Today</p>
<p>The Preliminary Completion of the Greater Shanghai Plan</p>
<p>Reception of Chinese and Foreign Guests and Military Parade</p>
<p>Today is the 22nd anniversary of the Republic of China. The new municipal building, the preliminary completion of the Greater Shanghai Plan in this city, will hold a completion ceremony at 10 a.m. this morning. The Municipal Government will host Chinese and foreign guests. After the ceremony, Mayor Wu Tiecheng will inspect the city's security teams and police brigades. This will be followed by a firefighting demonstration by the Shanghai Fire Association. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, and others visited the site to inspect the arrangements. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Magnificent and Splendid</p>
<p>The new municipal building is entirely in the style of our palace, magnificent and splendid, the best among all municipal buildings in the country. In addition to the large auditorium, dining hall, and library, the interior mainly consists of offices for bureau chiefs, section chiefs, etc., with separate doors and households, totaling more than one hundred rooms on four floors. The mayor's office is on the third floor. The entire building, down to the lamps and chairs, is in the antique style, matching the building perfectly. To the left of the municipal building are the Land Bureau and the Public Works Bureau, and to the right are the Health Bureau, the Education Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Public Utilities and Finance Bureaus. The bureau chiefs are temporarily using a room in the municipal building for office work. The Public Security Bureau will not be relocated for the time being due to commercial district and land reasons. Yesterday, the arrangements in the area were extremely busy. The Party and national flags were hung around the municipal building's red silk gate, and archways of tall towers, pines, and cypresses, adorned with electric torches, were erected at the entrances of Sanmin Road and Wuquan Road, with words such as "Commemorating the Completion of the New Shanghai Municipal Building." Personnel were assigned to guide vehicles in and out and park them in designated areas. The police brigade also began arranging guard posts yesterday. The Red Cross rescue team had already set up tents in the parade ground. Two tall towers were built on the right side of the ground, to be used as model houses for the fire brigade's demonstration today. Yesterday, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, and officials from various bureaus visited the site. Mayor Wu also tested the wireless amplifier. Therefore, the city center will surely be a grand occasion this morning.</p>
<p>The Construction Process: A Talk by Shen Yi, Director of the Public Works Bureau</p>
<p>Shen Yi, Director of the Public Works Bureau, spoke about the construction process of the new municipal building, saying that the new municipal building took one year and three months from groundbreaking to completion. On this day of grand celebration, it is appropriate to have a report on the construction process.</p>
<p>(Wang Kai's photo of a panoramic view of the new municipal building.)</p>
<p>Now, I will briefly describe it as follows: (1) The Municipal Government established the Preparatory Committee for the Construction of the Municipal Government in September of the 17th year. In July of the 18th year, the plan for the central area of the city was announced, and the Construction Committee for the central area of the city was established at the same time. On July 7th of the 20th year, the groundbreaking ceremony for the new building was held, and construction officially began. The progress was quite smooth. However, the "January 28th" Incident suddenly occurred, and the central area of the city became a war zone. Construction was suspended for nearly half a year. After the war stopped, construction was resumed immediately, which was on June 1st of the 21st year, only a few weeks after the ceasefire. The colleagues of the Municipal Government, from the mayor down, all held a determination that, at this time of serious national crisis, we can only shoulder our responsibilities, do everything step by step, and persevere with perseverance. How do we know that the current setbacks are not the key to future revival? The construction plan for the central area of the city has been the Municipal Government's decision for many years. Its preliminary stage for the Greater Shanghai Plan has long been recognized by society. If we fail after this setback, we will not only fail to live up to the government's trust and the citizens' expectations, but also bring endless shame to the country and the nation. Therefore, even if the environment is very difficult, we dare not slacken the progress. Since the resumption of construction, in addition to focusing on the new building project, we have also been working on the roads, ditches, bridges, parks, etc. in various regions. The roads in the first reclaimed area have been largely completed, and more than half of the ditches have been built. The Guohua Road and Funan Road bridges have been built, and the parks and sports fields have taken shape. The water, electricity, and telephone facilities have also begun to be installed. The roadbed earthwork in the second reclaimed area and the staff reclaimed area has also been completed. The completed main roads include Sanmin Road, Songhu Road, Xiangyin Road, Qimei Road, Huangxing Road, and Jungong Road, etc. The crisscrossing traffic has become convenient, and the future development is just flourishing. (2) All design, supervision, and other matters of the new building project were presided over by domestic architects and engineers, and no foreigners were involved. However, the appearance of the building completely adopts our country's inherent architectural style, and the building materials are also made in China as much as possible, such as the cement of the Qixin Cement Company and the glazed tiles of the Guangzhou Yuhua Ceramics Company. This should be solemnly declared. (3) The bid price of the building itself is 548,000 yuan, the sanitary equipment is more than 67,000 yuan, the telephone is more than 51,000 yuan, the elevator is 23,000 yuan, the wire and cable are 18,000 yuan, the electric clock is more than 4,900 yuan, and the total cost of other miscellaneous items is about 750,000 yuan. Compared with the general public buildings in this city, the cost is often several million yuan, which is far from being inferior. However, the outside world is unaware and thinks that this building is too magnificent and splendid, which is not suitable for today. I don't know that the Municipal Government also considered it again and again at the beginning of the plan. As a result, it was considered that in this autumn of people's livelihood withering, it should not add to the splendor. However, this city is the largest in our country. (4) The success of everything must rely on the minds and talents of the majority of people and sufficient time. Yi, a member of the Municipal Government, has been working in the Municipal Government for more than six years. Today, I am able to see the completion of this new building. First of all, I have to be grateful for the guidance of the past mayors. Since the former Mayor Huang, Zhang Boxuan, Zhang Yuejun, and the two former mayors, to the current Mayor Wu, all have adhered to a consistent proposition and worked towards the same goal to realize the Greater Shanghai Plan. This is the magnificent building, the main entrance of the new Shanghai Municipal Government Building. (Wang Kai's photo)</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>The municipal government of the commercial port is also the highest administrative organ of the city, and the slightest thing is related to the people's observation and expectation, and it is also the system that should be respected. Moreover, the construction of the new municipal building is the beginning of the development of the central area of the city, and it is also the beginning of the realization of the Greater Shanghai Plan. If there is no considerable scale, how can we establish a reputation and strengthen the belief of the society? This is very different from the nature of ordinary government offices, and it can be suspected of being a luxury. Mayor Zhang Yuejun laid the foundation, and the current Mayor Wu completed its construction, which is not worthy of commemoration. Secondly, we should thank the colleagues of the various bureaus and offices of the Municipal Government and the Construction Committee of the Central Area of the City for their cooperation. Architect Dong Dayou spared no effort to preside over the design and supervision, and finally completed this great achievement, which is especially admirable. Furthermore, Xu Xintang, who was in charge of designing the steel</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Furthermore, there is also the design of the concrete Xu Xintang, and the work of Wang Hesheng, whose efforts cannot be ignored. In addition, the Zhu Sen Ji Construction Factory, which undertook the construction of this new house, from the factory owner to the workers, and the factories that supplied various equipment, such as Huatong Electric Company, Siemens Anmei and other foreign firms, and their employees, have made great contributions to the completion of this house, and should also be thanked. Moreover, the support of the colleagues of this bureau is especially commendable. In addition, all sectors of society, whether directly or indirectly, all those who have given us assistance, I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude. The Shanghai Municipal Government building has been completed, and various bureaus of this government will move in to work at the end of this year. This means that the city center plan has been completed, the archway at the intersection of Xiangyin Road (photographed by 酏尊庸).</p>
<p>It's too early to avoid losing it. The responsibilities of this government lie in implementing the established policies and gradually seeking their realization. However, this matter is of great importance, and it relies on everyone's efforts. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will understand the importance of the city center plan, take it as their own responsibility, and assist us at any time. Then, when this house is completed, we will not be able to sing and worship.</p>

<p>Xinsheng News Agency reported that the electricity strike has not yet been resolved. The company's employees, seeing the company's tough attitude, ordered the employees of various departments on the previous day through the staff welfare association to strike yesterday in support. Due to postal delays, only a small number of employees joined the strike yesterday. The Shanghai Electric Power Company's Staff Welfare Association held a meeting yesterday to discuss and decided that all employees would strike tomorrow. The Chinese Ratepayers' Association has asked the Municipal Council to take into account public interests and quickly impose fair controls. The company stated that someone was making things difficult. The details are divided as follows:</p>
<p>Employees Expressed that After 1,400 workers of the Electric Power Company declared a strike on the 2nd of this month, the lack of concessions from the company caused dissatisfaction among all employees. On the previous day, the Electric Power Company Staff Welfare Association issued a notice to all Chinese employees of various departments to join the strike from yesterday. However, the letters sent were inconsistent due to the changes in the addresses of each person, which inevitably caused errors. After the Chinese employees of the Electric Power Company received the notice from the Staff Welfare Association, most of them stopped entering the factory or the writing room to work. However, a small number of employees, because they saw that there were not many people, still worked as usual, so they also entered the office. In total, it is estimated that there are more than 150 meter readers and more than 200 people joined the strike, while the rest are still working.</p>
<p>Xue Erde Talk According to Xue Erde, Vice President and Manager of the Electric Power Company, who was helped by a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency, this worker's strike is very funny because the workers have not yet expressed the reasons to the company, and the company is unable to make amends. What can be said is that the workers who are willing to work are forced to leave the factory. According to the company's speculation, the workers do not have this ability. This point may be fooled by others, or someone wants to be difficult with the company, and then confuse social hearing. The workers clearly strike, and often say that they are slacking off. Many Chinese newspapers published articles about the errors of the company, which is ridiculous. It is also reported that the employees will join the strike, and the company has not heard of it. Regardless of whether they strike or not, the current and official affairs will definitely not cause any problems. If workers and employees continue to do so for a long time, the company can still operate normally. Currently, many workers come to report that they want to enter the factory to work, but they cannot do so because they are threatened by others. The workers in the factory are still serving the company. As for the workers saying that the company has not contacted them on seven conditions, the company has not received any conditions put forward by the union. In July of this year, the workers served the company's methods, which is only the meaning of a few workers, not the public opinion of all, so the company did not negotiate. If the employees of the company want to propose conditions to the company, the company can accept all of them. The employees do not want to negotiate with the company, but the company is very willing to negotiate. I, Xue, claim that because I am afraid that the society does not know the truth, I will issue a statement within a few days.</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Letter The Public Concession Taxpayers' Association issued two letters yesterday, one to the Municipal Council and one to the Union. The letter to the Municipal Council is as follows: The case is that when your council sold the Electricity Department, this association held a special objection, because the public utility should be handled by the municipal government, to implement the purpose of public use. If it is transferred to a private organization with the purpose of profit-making, it will inevitably eliminate the purpose of your council to seek the interests of the public and the good rules for treating workers. When your council managed it, the cost was gradually reduced, but now it is increased because the price of coal is expensive, and the price of coal is not reduced because the price of coal is cheap. According to those who are familiar with the content, the speed of the fire watch is also higher than before. As for the treatment of workers, it is even more unbearable to dismiss old workers with high salaries in order to reduce expenses, and to hire workers who are not in the locality to oppose our compatriots who have the most users. Recently, it has become even more intensified, and even the rewards set by your council have been completely abolished in fact. Since retirement and dismissal are not entitled to rewards, no one can get rewards. Since your council managed the Electricity Department in 1893 until it was sold in 1929, except for the May 30th Incident, the employment between the two parties was peaceful. However, only a few years after the Shanghai Electric Power Company acquired and took over, labor disputes have occurred frequently. Fortunately, there are still many workers. Your council transferred them because they are well-trained and deeply understand the importance of public interest. Therefore, in the midst of being greatly oppressed, they have endured and served. Unexpectedly, the company has ignored the salary increase, working hour reduction, and economic recovery plan implemented by President Roosevelt, and instead gone the other way, heavily oppressing our compatriots. Under the sadness of the rabbit and the grief of the two injuries, or unpredictable serious events may occur. Since electricity is a public patent business, it is the duty of your council to come out and interfere. Although the managers are private organizations, their nature is actually the same as that of your council's self-run, and it is never appropriate to disregard public interests and shirk their responsibilities. Accordingly, I request that your council quickly take the position of a fair body to implement fair control. This is to Shanghai Public Concession Engineering Bureau for review. Also, I replied to Shanghai Fourth District Water and Electricity Industry Union Strikes Committee and said that I received a letter respectfully and learned that Shanghai Electric Power Company dismissed the labor friends transferred by the Public Concession Engineering Bureau of the Public Concession for no reason, did not pay labor bonuses, and rejected the mediation of Mr. Xu Xinliu, Yuan Luedeng, and Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Wang Xiaolun. It is painful to see the interests of labor friends and the status of the mediators. The workers' forced idleness to promote its reflection is a last resort. However, the company's move to close the factory (Lockout) further stimulates public anger, which is free to think. However, the unions should take into account the interests of the masses, should bear the burden of humiliation, and hope not to follow the extremes of the Shanghai Electric Power Company authorities in order to hope that those who are able to win. In addition to the fact that the Engineering Bureau has issued a fair mechanism to produce fair control, the corresponding letter is replied to, hoping to be checked and informed to all the workers.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Textile Industry Committee Member Issues Statement <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Association's Future and Plans</p>
<p>Since the National Economic Council issued the declaration of the Textile and Cotton Industry Control Committee, discussions have been diverse and inconclusive. The following is a statement issued by a member of the association's Textile Industry Committee:</p>
<p>It is well known that the cotton industry occupies an important position in the national economy of our country. However, in the past, the planting, manufacturing, and sales of cotton were all freely managed by individuals. This kind of scattered economic organization is not only insufficient to adapt to the current environment, but has also exposed the danger of the collapse of the entire cotton industry. Therefore, the National Economic Council has organized the Cotton Industry Control Committee, which will formulate a feasible and specific plan for planting, manufacturing, and sales, and gradually promote it in order to achieve the goal of helping the country and the nation to be self-sufficient and economically self-reliant.</p>
<p>In the past, although there have been calls for improvements in planting, manufacturing, and sales, whether from individuals or groups, the results have often been limited and ineffective due to inconsistent wills and actions. Now that there is an organization of the Cotton Industry Control Committee, matters such as improving cotton seeds and expanding cotton fields in terms of planting; formulating standards for work, equipment, employment, management, training, bookkeeping, product statistics, etc., and expanding research, education, and affiliated industries in terms of manufacturing; and reducing costs, facilitating transportation, providing timely information, stabilizing values, investigating production and sales, coordinating finance, and reducing speculation in terms of sales, will all be carefully planned and detailed by experts. Plans and solutions will be implemented in cooperation with all relevant parties, prioritizing urgency. Other emergency rescue work for the current textile industry is also included in the plan. However, although we intend to plan all cotton industry matters with a commercialized and industrialized spirit, so that time and money are not wasted and there are no disturbances or destructive consequences in the business, it is impossible to seek quick results given the current national status of our country and the many weaknesses in human and financial resources. Therefore, it is hoped that all relevant parties will take a long-term view, unify their will, and work together once the plan is formulated. Perhaps some small effect can be gradually achieved. Otherwise, if nothing is done now, if the cotton industry, which ranks first in agriculture and industry, collapses, the country will soon perish.</p>
<p>Capital Railway Exhibition</p>
<h3 id="e128">Invites All to Visit <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Free Transportation for Those Holding Invitation Cards</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways' National Railway Line Products Exhibition will open on National Day at the YMCA on Zhonghua Road in the capital. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations have specially invited all sectors of the city to visit. Those holding invitation cards can take the express train to Beijing from Shanghai at 8 AM on the 12th and return to Shanghai at 12:45 PM on the afternoon of the 13th, free of charge.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Two New Naval Ships to Be Launched Today <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Raising the Flag on New Year's Day</p>
<p>The Navy Department's newly built coastal patrol gunboats, the Fifth and Sixth ships, "Weining" and "Suning," have been under construction for several months, and most of the work has been completed. Only the boilers and gun mounts have not yet been installed. According to supervisor Wang Zhiguang, the displacement is 300 tons, the length is 140 feet, the width is 20 feet, the draft is 6 feet, and the speed is 11 knots per hour. There are two cannons and four machine guns. The Navy Department has ordered that the launching ceremony be held this morning. Zheng Pingren has invited Mrs. Morgan, the chief engineer of the Jiangnan Shipyard, to officiate. The flag will be raised on New Year's Day next year.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Zhejiang Overseas Water Police Bureau Purchases Wireless Equipment <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Zhenhai Overseas Water Police Bureau, in order to ensure maritime safety in winter, has purchased three ship wireless sets from Dahua Wireless Radio Company, No. 9 Sanmalu, Shanghai, due to the urgent need for wireless equipment. The company has completed the manufacture of all the machines and installed them on various ships of the police bureau.

<h3 id="e131">Chongqing-Yunnan Flight Test Unsuccessful <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Stopped by Heavy Fog Near Guiyang</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation telegraphed yesterday morning, stating that yesterday (the 8th) at 10:00 AM, pilot Anlisen took off in a Stinson aircraft. However, only forty miles from Guiyang, Guizhou, they encountered heavy fog and could not fly. To avoid danger, they had to return to Chongqing. Therefore, the flight test has not yet been successful.</p>

(2) The association should immediately prepare to establish a clubhouse. Dong Chi, the director of preparation, will formulate a plan and submit it to the executive and supervisory committee for review, but participation will be based on free will. (3) The association members will have a monthly dinner from November onwards, with the cost of the dinner borne by the participants.
