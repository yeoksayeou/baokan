<h3>昨日颶風龍滬</h3>
<p>烈風暴雨進出口輪船停航</p>
<p>江潮倒灌各馬路積水沒脛</p>
<p>東海二颶風、自前晨會合北侵、愈吹愈緊、初由溫台寗波洋面、經由大戢山而至吳淞口外、昨晨離滬愈近、據天文台昨日上午報告、早晨六時許、離滬約二百英里、下午三時報告、颶風中心、離滬約一百十英里、及昨晚九時報告、颶風在東經一百二十二度半、北緯三十度半、方向爲北北西、離滬約六十海哩、可見風勢襲滬之猛烈矣、本市昨日上午、彤雲密布、下午三時許、陣風中間以細雨、入晚六時許、暴雨驟作、風力尤猛、至十一點、浦江潮水驟漲、由瓦筒陰溝、倒灌而上、各馬路積水沒脛、民國二十年之大水、又重見於昨晚也、茲分誌各情如次、</p>
<h3>天文台訊</h3>
<p>二日午後四時三十分徐家匯天文台報告稱、上海有陣雨及風力九至十度或十度以上之烈風、且有薄霧、颶風向西北北進行、顯有轉向之象、現距上海漸近、夜間將過揚子江口、東海黃海均有旋風、此間海濱一帶有狂風、午後四時、颶風中心、約在距北緯三十度東經一百二十三度交點三十哩之内、向西北北進行、風力劇烈、又二日午後三時前二十四小時内、本埠氣溫、最高八六·○、最低七七·○、去年同日、最高七七·○最低六六·二、</p>
<h3>颶風襲滬</h3>
<p>昨日上午、上海已受大風侵襲、但上午風勢猶小、約六個風力之東北風、在吳淞口外、自溫州洋至甬海口大戢山等處、風勢最烈、而向北西北偏進、推進甚速、每小時達二十六哩二、故至晚已到上海、經過之處咸遭襲擊成災、下午滬上有極大陣雨、氣溫因之下降、</p>
<h3>江水暴漲</h3>
<p>昨日下午浦江受颶風之吹襲江面潮水暴漲、已與江岸相並、浦江内各小火輪、自下午起、便提前停駛、而舳板船小划子等、悉避入隠風處之各碼頭、已無船隻往來、</p>
<h3>江潮倒灌</h3>
<p>自昨晨天文台報告颶風將波及本埠之消息、傳出後、一般人尙疑信參半、並冀倖徼避免於萬一、昨晨三時半左右、暴雨驟降、嗣後即綿綿不息、迄未稍霽、上午風勢漸起、由緩而急、入晚逾吹逾緊、九時後來勢更狂、浦江潮頭猛漲不已、十時水已上陸、外灘一帶完全浸沒、至十一時零五分水勢已越四川路·江西路·河南路·轉瞬而抵山東路直達本館門首矣、車輛自河南路向東、即不能通過、汽車有抛錨者、截止今晨三時、馬路上潮水、迄尙未退、</p>
<h3>警訊高懸</h3>
<p>江海關報警黑球、昨仍照常高懸於海關屋頂、表示颶風正在吹來、航商仍應警戒、外洋涇氣象台上、亦掛大風到來之信號、日間以球示警、夜間則易以警訊燈、使浦江船舶、可以瞭望得見、而徐家匯天文台之用無綫電傳遞颶風方向與惟行狀况氣候測度等、與沿海各輪、至爲忙碌、</p>
<h3>滬甬阻航</h3>
<p>今回大風、以溫州寧波各海岸、及浙江沿海各埠、吹襲最大、故昨日招商局、滬甬輪新江天號·三北之　興號輪均未離甬開滬、溫州·台州·舟山·各船、昨亦未曾進口、因前晚多未開出故也、而在滬避風之滬台班各輪、昨仍繼續停航、上海至浙海各口海面、交通完全阻斷者、</p>
<p>已四十八小時矣、</p>
<h3>海輪未到</h3>
<p>昨日、竟天大風、入晚風力益大、各公司海輪、由南北洋來滬、而遭颶風阻止、不及開抵上海、在中途及吳淞外抛停避風者、有公平·新銘·海上·大連丸·長崎丸·綏陽·怡生·克爾郤士·號等等、均發電來滬、言爲風所阻、不敢冒險駛入、故昨日到滬輪船、祇由長江開來之大通·江華·美流·等數艘、餘皆在吳淞外海面各處避風也、</p>
<h3>出口停頓</h3>
<p>前日下午起、上海各海船、已停止開航、至昨日風力更烈、各輪公司應開之南北洋輪、若新寧·怡生·通州·阜生·富升·等船、均一律宣告止開、而各碼頭裝卸貨件、亦因而停止工作、蓋貨船駁輪、咸不開裝也、惟大來洋行麥金蘭總統、與胡佛總統等兩郵船、仍照常駛離上海、到吳淞後、再觀風勢而定進止、其他有藍烟囱並德法各貨船、亦展　出口、至於長江輪船、昨仍照常開行、</p>
<h3>市長關心</h3>
<p>市長吳鐵城氏、因颶風過滬、嚴令各局、妥籌防範並命公安局特别注意於颶風來滬時之救濟工作、不論陸上浦中、均須加緊工作、同時並命市公務局對於市區範圍以内之堤工、分别派員前往視察、俾於緊急時搶救、市府對於此舉、並準備隨時指撥特别費用、俾資辦理迅速、</p>
<h3>路局防範</h3>
<p>京滬滬杭甬路局、昨以本埠發生颶風、風勢甚烈、攸關兩路交通、故特通飭兩路所屬各關係員司人等、凡兩路各站停站之空車、均須用枕木堵塞、防其行動、發生危險而沿路所設之電報電報電話桿綫等、如發生中斷損壞等情、務須立刻報告、俾可轉知工程處、派員工到來趕修、以維交　、</p>
<h3>航空暫停</h3>
<p>中國航空公司滬漢飛航、由滬西上機、昨祇至南京爲止、東下機昨未開出、該公司赴菲測量之塞可斯機、本定昨日由菲起程返滬、但該公司昨未接到該機業已啓程之消息、度亦因颶風關係而延期矣、</p>
<h3>堵水受創</h3>
<p>昨晚八時半廣東路三號大來洋行大班飭出店等多人、在行之四週、堆置沙袋、俾防江水侵入、有銅匠顧更生者、年二十六歲、寗波人、亦在參與工作、忽一陣颶風吹來、有牆壁鉅大玻璃窗一方墜下、適擊中顧之頭部、受創沉重、後經二零零八號崗捕查見、亟送仁濟醫院療治、聞性命堪虞云、</p>
<h3>西報紀載</h3>
<p>大美晚報云、二日下午三時、據徐家匯天文台報告、颶風中心距滬僅一百十哩、正向此間吹來、縱此時尙不無轉向右方、吹入黃海之機會、但苟非臨時發生一種可以變更風向之要素、則今（二日）夜或明晨恐將以全力進襲滬埠也、當今晨六時許、颶風猶在二百哩外、上海附近已有大風陣雨、相間迭作、爲其先導、其時颶風中心尙在北緯二十七度半東經一百二十四度半、向西北西方進行、但動極緩、以故其襲滬之時亦難測定、據揚子江口大戢山氣象台報告、其時已有風力八度之烈風吹過該處、按此次颶風、本有兩個中心、昨（一日）日在浙江海濱附近結合、遂令風向稍微右轉、直向上海襲來、惟目下上海附近雖無高壓足以使其改向、而颶風行動常具彈性、能倖或免受其中心之襲擊、亦未可知云、</p>

<p>論者、咸謂近年之中蘇貿易中、中國乃處於敗北地位、此固爲事實、按照海關統計、在此時期内、中國在中蘇貿易中、入超達一○·○○○·○○○元、惟以中國將來對蘇貿易希望之巨、此種入超現象、當能立予挽救、於此應加詮釋者、即此項數字之造成、蓋别具原因、第一蘇聯在此時間、所購大豆並未列入中國海關統計、同時輸入蘇聯之第二大宗貨品即爲華茶、華茶之輸入蘇聯者、占其總輸出百分之三十、有數種華茶、幾全部爲蘇聯所買進、唯蘇聯購進華茶困難頗多、例如蘇聯在其他產茶國家、賒賬購貨、可不成問題、其在中國、則成爲頗難解决之問題、故華茶如欲擴張對蘇聯之輸出、則應謀提供至少與其他國家相同之條件也、回顧中蘇貿易之歷史、蘇聯固殊願購置華貨者、惟此亦須視華人給予蘇聯之條件爲何如耳、蘇聯輸入中國之貨品、向不甚多、即以最近半年内之情形論之、美國貨品之輸入中國者、占中國總輸入額百分之二十、澳洲占百分之十一、英國占百分之十、日本占百分之九·八、而蘇聯則僅占百分之二、由此可知所謂蘇聯貨品侵奪中國市塲之宣傳、實爲無稽之談、</p>
<h3>國貨競爭</h3>
<p>抑更有進者、蘇聯輸入中國之貨品、不惟不與中呀國國貨相競爭、且更推進中國實業之發展、按照目前中國實業狀况、若干貨品不得不購自國外、例如煤油·木材、海味等等、同時蘇聯實業向與其它各國絶少聯繫、故其出品、一至中國、即與其它各國貨品處於競爭之地位、而打破歐美貨品之獨佔、而貨品價格因之跌落而中國實蒙其利也、按本年上半年度蘇聯共輸入　魚四八○、○○○金單位、海味二七、○○○金單位汽油五五四、○○○金單位、煤油一、一九八、○○○金單位、木材九一三、○○○金單位、（中間多數爲中國木材廠最需用之圓木）布匹六一三、○○○金單位、以上各項貨品、惟布匹一項、似爲與中國國貨競爭之貨品、唯於此須指出者、其他各國在同時期内曾輸入布匹三二、○○○、○○○金單位、蘇聯輸入布匹對此僅爲千分之十九之比、孰謂此微細之比例、乃得與中國作危險之競爭乎、如上所述、中國對蘇聯出口貿易所佔地位、頗爲優越、而蘇聯貨品之輸入中國者、爲數又極微、故中蘇貿易之發展、必有絶大之希望無疑、</p>
<h3>設立專局</h3>
<p>復次、論者恒謂實業及財政兩部所擬設立之對俄貿易局、與中蘇貿易之前途頗有關係、按該項貿易局之任務、在通盤計劃一切中蘇貿易之業務、其設立也、理由頗多、最重要者、厥爲中國自衛其貿易一端、唯諸君如洞悉上述狀况、則知旣無侵略之存在、復何自衛之必要吾人大惑不解者、即蘇聯之輸入僅佔總輸入額之二、而其危險程度、何以竟甚於占百分之九十八之其他國家輸入乎、何以對於蘇聨别具眼光、而　特别之步驟以對付乎、鄙人以爲此舉如有避免、則中蘇兩國貿易之　展希望　大此種希望、事實上定能實現、且亦爲雙方共願實現者云云、</p>

<p>農村專號靑菜  茸餘　　寒天的田野中，稻婚刈割：荳兒收成，似乎是寂寞而冷落了。可是烏油碧綠的靑菜，仍是佈滿了這畦町；點綴了這大地。鄕間是終年不會像牛山般的濯濯；又不會像沙漠般的不毛。　　靑菜在那早上，給一陣濃霜舗蓋着，好像一個綠衣女郎，塗了雪花，益顯得楚楚可憐。到了中午，太陽光照着，好像千百株矮小的芭蕉，給大地做了一個綠絨坐墊。黃昏時候，夕陽晚霞，反射在菜葉上，呈現一種嬌痴的樣兒，又像一個微醉的美人。唉！靑菜這東西，在城市中人看來，一些都不名貴，一些都不摩登；沒有桃李般的鮮　，沒有玫瑰般的芬芳，有甚麽値錢。而在鄕下人眼光中看來，旣可賺錢，又可以自已咬嚼，眞和黃臉婆子和乾臉老牛一般重要咧。　　白白的梗兒，靑靑的葉兒，肥美而又鮮新的菜兒，鄕人正不知費了多少心血。天晴時澆水，閑空時捉蟲；黃金般的肥料，甘露般的雨霖。長大的挑到街上去喊賣，正不知「爲誰辛苦爲誰忙」咧！可是喫菜的人們，祇知道咬菜根是一年　苦事；「靑菜豆腐」，連在一起，又是一味下賤的　肴，便把靑菜看得下賤了。要知道白山黑水間的健兒，口咬硬饝饝，那裡有這種靑菜咬嚼。災地的哀鴻，樹皮草根，津津有味，更把靑菜當作席上珍咧。　　「朱門酒肉臭，野有餓死骨。」有錢的人們，請你們節省些金錢，咬咬靑菜，做做功德吧！「時人不識農家苦，將謂田中穀自生。」都市的人們，請你們知道農人的苦楚，靑菜和穀禾一般，也是血汗所種來的呀！　　末了我還附帶說幾句話：在此國難期中，我們應當節衣縮食，替國家出些力。節衣便是穿一大布之衣」；縮食便是吃「靑菜豆腐」。這樣一來，旣可以提倡儉樸，而目「布衣」和靑菜，又是十足道地的國貨呀！汗滴禾下土  祖蔭　　「汗滴禾下土」這句詩，形容農人們在赤日當空下田裏工作的情形，再恰當情沒有了。黃豆般大的汗珠子，從額上流下，流入眼珠子裏，眼珠子　澀著，張不開，失去視覺，那就不能工作。他們想出一個奇妙的法子，把一根細繩子，做一隻箍，前面凸出一寸多長，套在額際　上，那汗流到箍沿，就歸注到凸出的繩子上，緣着「滴答滴答······」的流到稻葉上，再流到泥土裏，這樣，就不會再流入眼珠裹了。　　天還沒大亮，大約上海灘上的哥兒公子們，揉着惺忪的倦眼，走出跳舞塲，跳上汽車的時候罷，農人們已在汚濁泥漿的稻田裏耘，他們恐防着被毒蛇鳌傷，（這時還瞧不仔細）！因此在下田前個個都提高着喉嚨　喝着，當我被這種聲音驚醒時，再也不忍安於牀褥了。　　他們對我說：在毛氄的稻葉裏爬，背部灼着如火的太陽，四肢浸在被太陽光蒸發的沸　的水，裏瘴毒之氣，從鼻孔攻入五中，只覺得頭腦昏胘，心房間「勃勃···」的跳躍不停，好似小鹿兒在胸口撞。怪難爲情的我始終沒曾領略過這般滋味。　　臂膀在稻葉上磨擦着，磨擦着，肉一絲絲地都割裂開，有一種蟲，形狀像大的坑蛆，名呌「水蛆」的，伏在汚泥裏，假令碰在它身上，就給你「吱的」一口，咬得你直跳起來，雙膝終日在田裹裏拖，都給那尖銳的東西刺破，麻刺刺的好像蜂房。　　唉？「鋤禾日當午，汗滴禾下土，誰知盤中餐，粒粒皆辛苦」。酒綠燈紅，金迷紙醉下的士女們，請你們閉着眼，靜靜地想一想。農村的不可思議  朱殿　　農婦生了孩子，往往送給育嬰堂去了，自已郤跑到城裏人家去做乳姆。有乳不給他自已孩子吃，眞是不可思議。　　今夏西瓜價格很賤，每担祇售幾角錢，可是鄕下人皺着眉流着汗的仍要挑着向城裏兜賣，自已口渴了，拚命喝生水。這樣低賤的瓜，他們自已不肯吃，眞是不可思議。　　常看見農村稍有錢的人家的子弟，拿了父母血汗換來的金錢，到外邊去求學，由中學而大學，甚至留學。然而總不見他們學了什麽本領回到家鄕應用。農村，仍是黑暗的農村！他們的父老兄妹，仍在黑暗的地獄中掙扎。究竟要他們去讀書爲了什麽？眞是不可思議。　　鄕村小鎭的茶坊酒店裏有很多沒事做整天吃閑茶賭錢抽烟的游民。而一方面農村有很多荒廢的土地，等着人去種。這些人爲什麽有氣力不做事？眞是不可思議。傍晚的農村  宗傑　　塲地上坐滿了老少男女，塲角裏燒着枯草，陣陣的濃烟，隨着晚風播送，蚊蟲姑娘也不敢飛來礱龑擊了。年輕的姑娘，唱看舊式的山歌：「六月裏來熱難當，蚊子飛來叮胸膛，寗可叮奴千口血，莫叮我······」底下是唱得很含糊，想是難以出口的緣故。小孩子提着蒲扇，東趕西奔，捉那像鬼火般的夜螢。「螢火蟲，夜夜紅，飛到西，飛到東，······」這一種歌聲，很天眞的唱着。王老爹啣着那寸步不離的旱烟筒，火星一閃一閃的亮着。他那兒子阿大阿二喝得爛醉回來，走路一脚高，一脚低，歪歪斜斜，嘴裏還哼着東鄕調。　　「你倆在那裏撞得這般醉回來？欠人的債，怎樣打算」？王老爹很着急的問着。「管他媽的！今天有錢，今天喝酒，終年的勞苦，也不曾多餘半個錢。沒沒······法了，上上梁山去。······」阿大阿二邊走到房裏，放倒頭便睡。　　李家嫂嫂每晚坐在場上，東拉西扯，大談其山海經。今天却點着一盞油燈，躱在房裡，不知忙些甚麽？人家隔着窗子喊伊道：　　「李家嫂！爲甚麽不出來乘風凉？」　　「我在理些衣服，務須在今晚理好，明天一早到上海。」　　「到上海去幹甚麽？」　　「到上海帮傭去。吃了人家的飯，拿了人家的錢，總比種田好一些。」　　張家是村上數一數二有錢的人家，秋凉了他的大女兒要出嫁，大小姐却對伊媽說道：　　「自已織的布，又粗又難看，我不要，媽替我到上海去剪些洋布。」　　「洋布價便宜，顏色又好看，以後不用自已織了，這布機砍掉了當硬柴燒吧！」伊媽這樣的回答着。　　村盡頭一所小茶館，裏頭黑壓壓一屋子人，正樑上掛着一盞黯淡的火油燈，台上坐着一位光裕社名家ＸＸＸ先生，正在開講水泊梁山。他說的是：　　「晁蓋吳用······一任八人，在黃泥崗刦得十萬金銀寶，公平分派，從此在碗喝酒，大塊吃肉，不怕官吏欺壓，不怕······」　　聽的人個個眉開眼笑，簡直把梁山當做桃源：恨不得自已也去做一下晁蓋吳用······。　　月亮上來了，鄕下人預備着一早要工作，不敢賞玩那　的月色，都回到茅屋中去睡覺。這時那皎月照澈全村。也惟有他明白那村中人是苦是樂。車水  陳亮　　知了爬在楊樹枝上恨命地呌。　　望望天，找不到一些雲片，正像一個美人的臉兒沒一些斑點似的。　　巴望下點雨，可是偏偏沒有雨意。　　塘　那兒，架着水車，一咿唖，咿唖，咿唖。一這樣沒晝沒夜的車着水，誰也有些受不了啦，可是，不車不成功，東村上搶着咱們這兒的水，塘　是一天一天的淺下去，再不上勁車，乾掉就要命。不是嗎，這時的水是寶貴的，一熟的收成哪，稻子乾不起。前天，龍王廟頭和木家村搶水，就打起來，木家村的村長給龍王廟的一個小夥子那麽一脚就踼得回不過氣來。眞的，荒年的穀，旱天的水，都是種田人的性命。　　種田人的性命。這樣沒晝沒夜的車着，誰也有些受不了啦！可是！不車不成功。　　咿唖，咿唖，咿唖。　　咱們五個人，是一樣的小夥子，但，精神是衰老了，一夜一天沒閉過眼，就是閉也閉不了，這樣的旱災横在眼前。塘裹是一天一天的淺下去。望望田裏的稻，葉兒尖上是起了焦黃，垂着頭，垂着頭。憂愁龑上了心頭，下半年全家的生活就靠着這稻子，稻子乾死了，全家的人也要餓死了的！　　十條烏黑的廋削的腿扔着車軸兒轉着。淺淺的一槽子水給車板兒夾上來，媽的！夾到半路又給漏掉啦。水越淺越難車。阿唷來············想打些號子鬆鬆氣，可是喉嚨口就像　着一團棉絮，四肢都沒有力，脚上的泡是更多了。車軸兒也變怪啦，沒像昨兒那麽轉得快。　　毒煞煞的陽光，澆潢了背，不是一背，五個人他浸在毒煞煞的陽光裏，車着水，車着水這樣沒晝沒夜的車着水，誰也有些受不了，可是，不車不成功。荒年的　，旱天的水，都是種田人的性命。村姑  顏波光　　文人的枝筆，儘管描寫都市裡的摩登姑娘，從伊的波紋般的髮髮說到織細的長眉，又由靈活的眼媚說到艷麗的口紅，再從墳　般的乳房談到斯撥靈式的臀部，······總之，摩登姑娘的一舉一動，沒一樣不是文人的絶好資料，好似古代佳人沒有才子的筆代爲　染名不能彰一樣，所以現代的摩登姑娘，只怕文人不替伊描寫，不怕文人描寫得過火。　　村姑，是絶少人注意的，尤其是文人，因爲沒有到過農村，他是不知村姑的情狀。但是，村姑是樸實的，是天眞的，沒有半點裝飾，沒有半點虚僞，是値得我們表揚的，都市的女子們，如個個像村姑一般的裝束，戒去了奢侈，那麽國家流入外洋的金錢，一年不知要省却多少呢？　　村姑是不燙髮，不搽粉，不用口紅，穿的土布衣，說的誠實話。伊能裸着腿，跣着下田，分任農人的工作。我們怎麽不禮讚呢？　　社會上一切的一切，向着奢侈的途上跑，不知到什麽地步爲終點，而女子們的窮奢極欲，尤其可怕，所以我們該大聲疾呼，提倡女子村姑化。短篇小說伊的悲哀  可人　　天空中的一輪火　，漸漸地失却了它的炎威，很遷就的回到它的老家。天上又撒下一條黑紗，把整個的天空，一　腦兒籠罩住，伸手幾乎不見五指，那時，東方忽現魚白色，這顯然是月要升起來的景象，Ｘ家大嫂還在花田裡去草！鄰田的李家媽媽，阿春嫂嫂，還在日光未滅的時候去的。對浜的阿大，二福，崇明阿三，剛剛也荷鋤去了。伊心想回家，但看到田間的草莽，又長又茂，倒靑葱得非凡！棉花的葉瓣？還小得像銅錢般大，目都躱伏在草間，要不是仔細點看，那見有花的影縱呢？啊！這是老天不帮忙呀！！一陣陣的霉雨，降個不停，帮助草長，而挨住人們到田裏去工作，所以有現在這樣的成績！不過，别人家倒還好，因爲人手多，三兩天一做，便完工哩！苦祇苦了Ｘ家大嫂。　　伊的年紀還很靑，伊的丈夫是個糊塗蛋，出去了三年杳如黃鶴，誰靜不知道一點關於他的信息。所以連伊三歲的愛子祇有兩人，却種了六畝棉花，虧伊起待早；睡得晚，一連忙了幾天，現在終算要做出頭了。　　「這兩段地的花，終要在今天完工，不能再拖延下去，横竪月就要升起來了。」伊這樣的忖度着。於是，又俯下頭去鋤草。　　「媽媽，天夜了！去丨回去，我要到屋裡去！我餓了，我要吃······媽媽：你去不去」？還祇三歲的孩子，繞在伊身傍，拖住伊的一隻衣角噪着。　　「囝囝！乖點，不要噪呀！媽媽就要回去了，你看月月，亮亮來；這裏又風凉，你再坐一會吧！」伊這樣的撫慰着。　　「不要，······不要！」他仍噪着。　　「寶寶！你本來很乖的！現在怎的不聽人話，不乖了？你依了你媽媽的話，回家給好東西你吃。前天大姨姆媽，拿來的狀元糕很可口的，你要吃嗎？」伊仍這樣的撫慰着。　　「狀元糕是要吃的，不過，我現在要回去······回去！」地仍噪着。　　「回去，回去，你眞等不及，那你認識，便先回去好了，不依話的小囝！」伊似乎微微地有點慍怒。　　老三老四的說。　　「隨便你罷！我不管。」伊似乎很堅决地回答。　　他眞的搖搖擺擺的去了。　　「當心點，不要跌！到了家裡，不要跑開，媽媽就要來的。」伊這樣的關照着。　　伊自從伊的兒子去後，伊果然鋤好了一段地的花。不過，當要着手第二段的時候，伊的兒子活潑的影子在伊眼前憧憬着。蘆葦蕭蕭地似乎說：好回去啦！好回去啦！　　伊心裡覺得非常奇怪，陡覺得不自在，起來究不知是何朕兆？心頭怦怦的跳着。急急忙忙地荷鋤歸家。　　ＸＸＸＸＸ　　剛剛沐畢浴，在塲上納凉的我，嘴裏唱着東坡居士的水調歌頭，正在逸趣横生的時候，忽在一陣陣凉風中，傳來了悽楚悲　的哭聲，直鑽進我的耳鼓，據說這就是Ｘ家大嫂的哭聲！　　阿發在外面迅速的跳進來，喊道：「Ｘ家大嫂三歲的兒子死了，······溺死了！」　　「可憐呀！這孩子生得很伶俐，怎會溺死的？眞意料不到！」甲說。　　「總之，都是伊不好，你想：小小的孩子怎好呌他獨自回去呢？」乙說。　　「···············」丙說。　　「···············」甲又說。　　憐人都很不平似的這樣評論着。</p>

<p>自由談武俠小說爲何流行  高明　　現代，的確是俠客應該出現的時代。社會上充滿的是不平。汽車壓死了人，因爲被壓死的大都是賤民，所以只要出一點錢就可以了事。而這一點錢，在那坐汽車的，也許連一毛之于九牛都不及。至於那被壓死的人，也許是老老小小有少人靠着他生活的。　　今年在「國貨年」之外，還是「水災年」。長江之水，算是天保佑，倖免成災，但是黃河却出了毛病。據說這次在災區溺死的人，幾及五分之四，可說慘痛已極。平時從老百姓那裏微去了鉅額的防災費，而結果却防出了這樣的大亂子，當然又是我們的大人先生們幹的好勾當。但是政府對他們的懲罰，却是「記過一次」。　　就像這樣，因爲社會上是充滿着不平，而政府又不能替我們　除這些不平的種子，所以一般胡塗的老百姓就發生兩種想頭。一種是希望眞命天子出現，再一種是希望來幾個俠客。　　第一種想頭，因爲照我們中國法律會構成「危害國家」的罪名，所以未被公開表現，卽使談論，也只是私下談論着。至於第二種想頭之公開表現，則第一因爲俠客大抵帶着忠主的性質，可不致危害政府丨不，國家！丨，第二因爲它完盡着麻醉一般百姓的任務，所以前一陣雖曾被取締，最近却終於又弛禁了。政府這次的舉動，當然是很賢明的。　　在武俠小說（以及武俠戲劇武俠電影）所表現的人物之中，最被一般人所敬慕的便是剣劍俠，卽口吐一道白光（或鼻吐兩道白光），能於若干里外取人首級而不被人知道之輩。這些英雄們之所以特别被敬慕，也就是因爲他們的本領的確比手使一柄鋼刀之輩來得高强，能夠兼合明哲保身之道。因爲在我們中國，無論其動機如何，捨掉性命這件事，總是被一般人愚視的。再有這些英雄們的結果。也和手使一柄鋼刀之輩之被抓去殺頭的不同，大都「不知所終」；這也和中國一般人的做神仙的想頭相符。　　所以，用一句話道來，武俠小說之類之所以流行，是因爲它們能夠滿足一般老百姓的需要。有些人以爲，一些作者之所以製作這些作品，完全出於麻醉人民的目的；我以爲這是一種錯誤。因爲據我們所知，中國的一些作者，還沒有這樣「有閑」。固然這些作品帶着有模糊人民視聽，妨礙他們直視現實的作用，是我們所確認的。英語簡易化與基本英語  錢歌川　　歐洲的洋鬼子，首至中國内地來的是葡萄牙人。他們出入於上川·澳門·泉州·寗波等處，頗有一部分勢力。英國人在中國之横衝直撞，還是他們販賣鴉片，恃强得勝以後的事。因爲英人之無孔不入，英語在中國也就廣播起來。不僅因此造成了一種中外馳名的，蕭伯納所贊許，林語堂所擁護的洋涇浜英語，而且當我們的敎育當局將外國语定爲學校必修科目的時候，採用最多的還是英語。英語旣成了大部分學校的必修科，它把我們在學齡的寳貴時間，佔去了大半，也是必然的結果。必修科是學不好也得學的。如果我們都有文學的天才，倒可以像日本的秋田雨雀一樣，改途易轍，去學Ｅｓｐｅｒａｎｔｏｏ可惜我們旣無那種天才，即有，環境也不許我們全然抛棄英語，因此我們只好在英語的範圍内，求簡易的捷徑，恰好這時英國的奥格登成功了基本英語（ＢａｓｉｃＥｏｇｌｉｓｈ），只用八百五十字，可以會話，寫信，作文，正合了我們的要求，所以我們馬上把它介紹過來，不期竟惹起了Ｅｓｐｅｒａｎｔｏ同志的非難林語堂先生的幽默。Ｅｓｐｅｒａｎｔｏ與英語，各有短長，各有園地，不僅互不相侵，而且不妨兼修並學。我並未因爲學過英語而反對Ｅｓｐｅｒａｏｔｏ，我想Ｅｓｐｅｒａｎｔｏ的同志，也當然不會因爲自已學的Ｅｓｐｅｒａｎｔｏ，而攻擊英語罷。至於林先生因感懐國事，倡幽默文學以諷喻時賢，固然是我們所同意的，但以英文學者的地位，對於基本英語的批評，似不應全出於幽默之筆，故意假設引證（如引卡爾與安娜第幾第幾貢皆原書所無）以亂聽聞，何况如留聲機·無綫電等字皆曾作爲國際通用字收入基本英語入門中，更無須在喇叭前畫狗像了。　　最近在本報上看到索原先生的兩篇文章，談到基本英語與Ｅｓｐｅｒａｎｔｏ的問題，承他對基本英語不吝「加以批評，」並指摘兩件事：㈠拚法未合理化，㈡文法未簡單化。於是便結論到基本英語「不能不說是完全失敗了。」基本英語失敗不失敗的問題，有事實可以證明，全國的學者可以代爲答復，我不願與索原君作紙上的空談；至於他所提出的兩點，頗有關學理上的討論，謹答如下：　　（一）關於英語拚法的改良運動，在十六世紀的末葉已有人提倡過了。後來在美國又有所謂ＳｉｍｐｌｉｆｉｅｄＳｐｅｌｌｌｎｇＢｏａｒｄ及ＳｐｅｌｌｉｎｇＲｅｆｒｍＡｓｓｏｃｉａｔｉｏｎ的設立，一九零八年在倫敦也有所謂ＴｈｅＳｉｍｐｌｉｆｉｅｄＳｐｅｌｌｉｎｇＳｏｃｉｅｔｙ的提議，但這個運動的代表者，我們可以舉出Ａｎｇｌｉｃ來，關於英語的拚法改良它有十六條答案，可資參考。如果索原先生看到了，當嘆爲先得我心！可惜於我們學英語的人，並無多大帮助。美國人已將語尾的Ｏｕｒ改爲ｏｒ及Ｏｕｇｈ改爲ＯＷ了，爲什麽不同樣地把Ｋｎｏｗ字中的Ｋ，和Ｒｉｇｈｈｔ字中的ＧＨ去掉呢？這問題希望索原先生自已去研究好了。　　（二）不規則動詞及名詞複數的例外，誠如索原先生所說是不合理的，不過除了人造語以外，那一種活的言語是完全合理的呢。基本英語名詞的例外只有七個字，動詞助動詞一共只有十七個字，即是在所有的基本英語中不規則的變化，總共只有二十四字，這實在不能說多得難學，一天只要記一個字，天下頭號的笨人，也只消花得二十四天，少許聰明一點的人，三天即可卒業。要想學會一種外國語，若連這一點子苦工夫都不肯下，那我們還有什麽話好說呢？　　至於「祖國」與「用武之地」，我們用這幾個字的意思，是說「活着的言語」與「應用的地方」，全是指言語的本身而言，不是指學者，這是一看便明白的。難道我們學了一國的言語，便會成爲那國的臣民了嗎？薛覺先  巴金　　丨旅途隨筆之一　　在長堤上立着的許多房屋中間，我發見了海珠戲院。門口有紅紙的招貼，有電燈紥成的字；「薛覺先難忍相思淚；」「薛覺先夢斷秦淮月；」「薛覺先還我河山；」「薛覺先華麗緣」·········這樣一天天地變換着、　　在那些把「吳三桂軼事」「侍兒艷聞錄」等等文章刋登在第一版的廣州報紙上，這幾天正討論着「陳皮梅下嫁薛覺先」消息的眞僞之類的問題。　　薛覺先的名氣這樣大！　　有一天我和一個朋友偶爾談到這個在廣州流行的名字。出乎我的意料之外，他告訴我十年前他們刋印春雷月刋時，薛覺先曾經捐過毫洋二十元。奇怪，難道薛覺先也贊成社會革命？　　我决定去看薛覺先的戲。於是在某一個晚上我便進了海珠戲院，同去的是一個做　　記者的朋友和他的未婚妻。票價每張毫洋一元四角，是「散廂」，自　　　好　　。好的要售三元，其次還有二元　毫的座位。　　數廂是樓座的中間的幾排、和許多地方的舊戲院一樣座位是不會使人舒服的。至於普通舊戲院的特點：吵鬧，談笑，喝茶，嗑瓜子，人走來走云，空氣齷齪，悶人·········無不應有盡有。這地方完完全全是中國的，不帶一點歐化的色彩。　　震得人耳聾的　鼓聲突然響起來。我睜大了兩隻眼睛，彷彿周圍的景象全變了。我進了另一個世界。　　幕拉起來，於是戲開塲了。所謂「華麗緣」就一幕一幕地展現在我的眼前。伹今晚演的只是第二本。沒有開塲，也沒有結束。　　先出來的是官，官自然戴紗帽，穿高底靴，後面跟着四個小兵。接着又出來了女人（呌這做女人當然不恰當）。女人穿旗袍，剪髮，完全近代的裝束！這兩個隔了好幾世紀的男女居然對面談話了。似乎沒有人覺行奇怪。　　這些都不是薛覺先。然而薛覺先出來了。高底靴，繡花長袍，兩隻野鷄翖插在頭上，長臉，兩道竪起的長眉。不是近代人的裝束，不是近代人的臉貌。他和别的脚色不同，他張開嘴唱的時候，舞臺上就多了一個人來拉提琴，這似乎是專爲他而備的。但是有一件事情却是一樣：别的脚色說「廣州國語」的對由，唱廣東話的戲詞，他也是說「廣州國語，」唱廣東話。不過朋友說也比别的脚色唱得好。他的確得着觀衆的熱烈的歡迎。　　所謂「緣」自然還在舞臺上繼續着。許多人在我的眼前走來走去：皇帝，妃子，在臣，武將，小姐，公子······他們說話，他們行動，整整鬧了好幾個鐘頭。他們進去換一套新衣服又出來，展覧給我們看，好像這是他們對我們的應盡的義務。　　許多人滿意地笑了。到處都是帶着滿意的微笑的面孔。連我那朋友和他的未婚妻也看得很有興味。然而我的心却漸漸地沈重起來了。我忘記了是在一九三三年，我忘記了是在這因苦的中國。舊時代的鬼影又一次在我的眼前顯現了。舞臺上沒有一個人，完全是些鬼魂。忠臣，孝子，義夫，節婦舉動着不像一個人，而像一些已經死去的鬼魂。男的是奴隷，女的是娼妓，無論是國王，大臣，或者王妃，小姐，沒有一個例外。廣東戲和平劇以及一切的中國戲沒有分别，他們都是盡量地在把舊時代的毒汁注射進民衆的身體裏去。扮着忠臣，義夫，孝子，英雄的薛覺先和别的戲子一樣，不過是舊時代的一個鬼影罷了。　　（未完）女人（十）  沈從文　　「得了，好朋友是用不著明白這些的。這對我們友誼毫無用處。你且告我，你能夠在這一」汪　水裡盡你那手足之力，泅得多遠？」　　「我就從不疲倦過。」　　「你歡喜划船嗎？」　　「我有時也討厭這些船。」　　「你常常是那麽一個人把船划到海中玩着嗎」？　　「我只是一個人。」　　「我到過南方，見不見到過大棕櫊樹同鳳尾草」？　　「我在黑龍江黑壞中長大的」。　　「那麽你到過北京城了」。　　「我在北京城受的中學敎育」。　　「你不討厭北京嗎」！　　「我歡喜北京」　　「我也歡喜北京。」　　「北京很好」。　　「但我看得出你同别的人歡喜北京不同。别人以爲北京一切是舊的，一切皆可愛。你必定以爲北京罩在頭上那塊天，踏在脚下那片地，四面八方捲起黃塵的那陣風，一些無際那種雪，莫不帶點兒野氣。你是個有野性的人，故歡喜牠，是不是」？　　這精巧的阿諛使年靑男子十分愉快。他說：　　「是的，我當眞那麽歡喜北京，我歡喜那種明郎粗毫風光」。　　女子注意到面前男子的眉目口鼻，心中想說：「這是個小雛兀，不濟事，一點點温柔就會把這男子　魂高舉起來！你并不歡喜粗野，對於你最合適的，恐怕還是柔情」！　　但這小雛兀雖天眞却不俗氣。她不討厭他。她向他說：　　「你傍到我這邊坐下來，我們再來談談一點别的問題，會不會妨碍你？你怕我嗎？」　　「靑年人無話可說，只好微帶靦覥站近了一點，又把手遮着額部，眺望海中遠處，吃驚似的喊着：　　「我們的船并不在海中，一定還在岩壁附近」。　　他們所在的地方，已接近砂灘，爲一個小阜上，却被樹林隔着了視線，左邊旣不能見着岩壁，右邊也看不到砂灘，只是前面一片海在脚下展開。年靑男子走過左邊去，不見什麽，又走過右邊去，女人那隻白色小艇正斜斜的翻臥在砂灌灘上，趕忙跑回來告給女人。</p>

<p>Japan Refuses Our Army to Suppress Bandits in Luandong</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Receiving Yuguan Stalled</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Bandits are rampant in Luandong, and banditry is particularly severe in the Qinhuangdao area. The Hebei Provincial Government previously sent more than one hundred police officers to Haiyang Town to maintain security. The Japanese have occupied the Yuguan Railway Station and have already returned two of the staff dormitories. The Japanese were prepared to vacate the remaining three dormitories, as well as the Lu County Telegraph Bureau and the Tangshan Railway Official Residence after previous negotiations. The case of Yu Tian Shi Yousan insulting County Magistrate Dong Tianhua has been resolved peacefully. Dong has returned to the county. Whether he can be reinstated has not yet been reported. The task of the receiving committee is largely completed. After Yuguan is received, Yu Xuezhong will return to Hebei, and the war zone receiving committee will be concluded. Yu will go to Tianjin on the 4th to negotiate with the Japanese garrison on various unresolved minor issues. (Early Dispatch from Japanese Alliance)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Shisun said that after General Hishikari, the commander of the Kwantung Army, took over, there has been no indication from the Japanese side on the issue of returning Yuguan, so the negotiations have made no progress. We have invited the Kwantung Army in Changchun to proceed, but there has been no reply. The puppet organizations and the Maintenance Association in Linyu City have made no preparations to end. It is expected that a reply telegram will arrive in Beiping soon. (2nd, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yin Tong made a request to the military attaché Shibayama in Beiping to protest that the Kwantung Army, according to the truce agreement, had returned to the Great Wall line, but the remaining troops of Shi Yousan and Li Jichun had become bandits and were rampaging in Luandong in the demilitarized zone. They said that the Kwantung Army was the background, causing the Chinese side to be unable to dispatch troops or police teams to maintain security in the area, hoping to understand the situation. As a result of investigations by the Kwantung Army and the Chinese Army, although the facts were not wrong, the Chinese side's request was to send troops to the demilitarized zone, so it was decided to refuse. Also, some foreigners in North China said that the actions of the bandits were directed by Japan and the Kwantung Army, so the Japanese authorities felt very confused. (2nd, Dentsu News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Fleet Commander Tsuda Returns to Lushun</h3>

<h3>Song Ziwen Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Cotton and Wheat Loan Will Be the Main Topic of Discussion This Time</p>

Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Zhu Jiajie, Zeng Zhongwu, Zhang Daofan, etc. went to welcome him.

Dozens of representatives from the Nanjing Farmers' Association and the Labor Union rushed to the station to welcome him. Song and Wang happened to go to their private residence in Beijige in the same car. Ye and Ju Zheng, Chen Guofu, and others also followed to Song's residence for discussions. Song reported on his experiences abroad. Song originally planned to go to the Ming Palace Airport after getting off the car to respond to the welcome from all walks of life in the capital. Because he saw that representatives from the industrial and agricultural circles had already arrived at the station, he did not go to the airport. All walks of life in the capital are scheduled to hold a meeting at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center at 10:00 AM on the 3rd to welcome him. (2nd, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Minister Ning Exits the Station</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After Song Ziwen arrived in Nanjing, he immediately agreed with President Wang that he would take a plane to Xun on the 3rd to meet with Chairman Chiang.

Also, Song decided to entertain the press after returning to Beijing from Lu, reporting on the situation abroad. (2nd, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 3:00 PM, Song Ziwen visited Chairman Lin and paid a return visit to President Wang. At 7:00 PM, Wang hosted a banquet for Song at the official residence of the Ministry of Railways to welcome him back. Ministers from all departments were invited to accompany him. Song told reporters: 1. The most profound impression of this observation is that European and American countries are currently struggling calmly in an environment of economic panic. Domestic parties have many different political views on weekdays, but when major problems occur, they all sacrifice their prejudices and work together. If our country's government and the public can have this kind of spirit, then even if the national crisis is deep, there will always be a day of getting rid of it. 2. The government had already decided to use the cotton and wheat loan for construction purposes, but how to allocate it in the future must be decided after detailed central discussions. However, I can guarantee that this money will never be used for other purposes. 3. The central government has always had a consistent policy on foreign policy. As a member of the government, I naturally cannot have special opinions. However, considering the overall situation, we should regard self-reliance as the criterion. 4. The practice of borrowing international talents to assist our country in handling various projects such as water conservancy and road construction has been going on for a long time. The cooperation method agreed this time is just a slight expansion of the scope. Because our country's various industries and rural construction are in their infancy, this kind of construction is necessary for the sake of national survival. The central government has long had this plan. Borrowing talents from other places is a common thing and there is nothing surprising about it. If people must view me with other eyes, there is no need to argue deeply at this time, just wait for the facts to prove it in the future. As for which business to start with, it must be decided by the special center. 5. At this time of national crisis, not only our party comrades should unite, but also talents outside the party should work together to survive. (2nd, Special Dispatch) (Nanjing) After Minister Song got off the train at Hepingmen on the morning of the 2nd, he went to his private residence in Beijige with President Wang, Ye Chucang, Zhu Jiahua, and Zeng Zhongming. Subsequently, Xu Mo and Wang Shijie also rushed to have breakfast together and had discussions. According to a certain important person who attended the meeting, the content of the meeting was only Song reporting on his experience abroad, and Wang reporting on the political situation in the central government. Also, Wang, Song, and Sun planned to go to Guling on the 3rd. Song said, I plan to visit Chairman Chiang in Guling the day after tomorrow. At 8:40, Wang and Song took the same car from Beijige to the Central Party Headquarters to convene a temporary meeting of the Central Political Committee, which adjourned at 10:50. Wang and Song still returned to Beijige together, and then went to the National Government one after another to attend Chairman Lin's banquet with Prince Karl of Sweden. (2nd, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Tang Youren answered questions from guests: 1. The various major plans to be discussed at the Lushan Conference should focus on the use of cotton and wheat loans. 2.

<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen told reporters from the Central News Agency in Beijing on the 2nd that the international community is paying close attention to the prospects of our country's revival in various ways. I do not want to express my opinion on diplomacy.</p>
<p>Our country's economy is exhausted, and the countryside is bankrupt. Only by implementing a planned economy can we achieve the effect of cooperation. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has seen improvements since returning to state-owned operations, which is a clear example. The date of Lachmann's arrival in China has not yet been determined. The distribution of American cotton and wheat will be properly decided after gathering opinions from all parties. The silver agreement is more beneficial to us in terms of preventing dumping and affecting exchange rates. I will report to Foreign Minister Luo in writing on diplomatic matters. Zhang Xueliang will not return to China for the time being. I have reported to President Wang and the central government on my experience abroad since coming to Beijing. On the 3rd, I will go to Jiangxi with President Wang, President Sun, Kong Xiangxi, and Huang Fu to visit Chairman Chiang, only exchanging views. (2nd, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

It will be fully reimbursed by the central government, and I also hope that local officials will be strictly ordered to do their best to resettle the victims and not let anyone be displaced. I am very concerned. (2nd, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Pan-American Political and Economic Alliance</h3>
<p>The Mexican President Believes that the Opportunity Has Matured</p>
<p>The Pan-American Conference Will Be Held in Uruguay at the End of the Year</p>
<p>Mexico Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas proposed today that the United States and Mexico should begin to organize the International League of the Americas as soon as possible. The Mexican President made this proposal while reporting to Congress on government affairs over the past year. Cárdenas elaborated on the problems of the Western Hemisphere, which should be resolved in the Western Hemisphere, saying that although several Latin American countries are currently in dispute, they are extremely friendly to both the United States and Mexico, so the timing of this movement is ripe. The League of Nations has made little progress in trying to mediate disputes in the Western Hemisphere. We should rise up and seek our own solutions. Since the late Ambassador Morrow first came to Mexico, there has been good friendship between Mexico and the United States, so the two countries should lead the various countries to take the lead, so that the Pan-American Union will become a powerful engine for promoting political and economic peace, or will create a completely new mechanism. Cárdenas also said that he hoped that the United States and Mexico would sign a reciprocal trade agreement in the near future to benefit the business of both countries. When discussing foreign trade, he also cited the opening of Tijuana and Ensenada as free ports, and said that there are many items that can reduce tariffs without hindering the domestic market. As for the financial situation, Cárdenas claimed that it is progressing slowly, and the political situation is also quiet. (1st, National Telegram)</p>

<p>Herriot Arrives in Moscow</p>
<h3>Signs of Franco-Soviet Amity</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Herriot and his entourage arrived here at 9:00 PM today from Rostov. Those who went to the Moscow Station to greet him were Litvinov of the People's Committee for Foreign Affairs, his assistants Karakhan and Krestinsky, the Chairman of the Moscow Soviet, Bulgamin, the Acting President of the Foreign Cultural Friendship Association, Lyle Nal, the entire staff of the French Embassy led by Counselor Paer, and reporters from Soviet and foreign newspapers. (1st, TASS Telegram)</p>
<p>Moscow News: French Air Minister Paul Caquot will also come to Moscow by plane in the next few days. This move can be regarded as a demonstration of Franco-Soviet friendship, the same as the visit of former French Prime Minister Herriot. (World Press)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The arrival of Herriot in Moscow has been welcomed by various newspapers here. The famous Soviet journalist Radek wrote an article in the "Izvestia" newspaper, stating that the Soviet people welcomed Herriot with deep attention and sympathy. He said, "Herriot has seen and understood the creative feats manifested by the establishment of the Soviet regime. He has personally seen our work, understood the meaning of our life and activities, and understood why there is such a desire for peace in the Soviet Union." He also said, "Herriot is a pacifist. He stands in front of the grave of capitalist self-confidence, thinking that with the power of capitalism, a peaceful policy can be used to overcome its internal contradictions. Today, the danger of war has reached its extreme. Only our country has found a way out in its great historical journey. He has never been spared the difficulties that the capitalist world cannot solve. He has formed an unprecedented phenomenon, that is, a desire for peace. This desire does not detract from the willingness to defend this country at all. At the same time, this desire constitutes the foundation of the enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of people. When they encounter a threat that hinders our peace and work, they will rise up in self-defense." Radek concluded, "In its struggle for peace, the Soviet Union is willing to shake hands with well-meaning people and politicians who are willing to rescue people from the new bloody slaughter prepared by imperialism and fascism. The meeting between Herriot and our country's political figures, if it can not only increase Herriot's sympathy for our country, but also help Herriot find a way to solve various problems in a way that suits the interests of France and the Soviet Union, then we will be very fortunate."

<p>Japan Monitors the League of Nations</p>
<h3>Sending Ito to Geneva to Show No Concessions on Disarmament</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The League of Nations Executive Council is scheduled to start on the 22nd of this month, and the League of Nations regular General Assembly is scheduled to start on the 25th. This time, the agenda will include technical assistance to China and other Far East issues. Because Japan has notified its withdrawal, its representatives will not attend, and it has also abandoned the position of president of the Council, which rotates annually, so it has decided to only send Ito Shushi and Councilor Yokoyama to Geneva to monitor.

<h3>The Lethal Blow to Japanese Sugar - Dutch Sugar Competing for Sales in China</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) For the purpose of self-sufficiency in sugar, the Indian government established a sugar manufacturing company and increased tariffs. As a result, Javanese sugar lost its market in India and sought to expand its sales in China. Representatives of Javanese sugar sales organizations reported to their country that establishing a sugar factory with Javanese capital in Shanghai and selling Javanese sugar raw materials could dominate the Chinese market and drive out Japanese sugar. On the one hand, Japanese sugar has become unprofitable for export due to the revision of the actual quantity assessment last October, and it has also been severely hit by the rejection of Japanese goods. If Javanese sugar sells well in China, it may be a fatal blow to Japanese sugar. (2nd, Dentsu News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Future of Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>The complicated and protracted situation in Sichuan Province has long been one of military warlords vying for control. However, because the territories and capabilities were roughly equal, no one has been able to rise above the others. In recent years, continuous warfare has led to military expenses being covered by levying exorbitant taxes, even to the point of sucking the marrow and fat of the people. Some Sichuan residents have already paid taxes up to the 54th year of the Republic, which is truly shocking. Yet, they are still forcibly conscripting civilians and driving them to the battlefield. The young and strong die on the front lines, while the old and weak are left to perish in ditches. The most difficult times in human history are indeed those that the people of Sichuan are enduring today. Since the central government appointed Liu Xiang to be responsible for cleaning up the chaos, and Liu Xiang himself has taken on the responsibility of unifying Sichuan, military leaders such as Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Li Qixiang, and Luo Zezhou have largely cooperated and advanced together, seemingly poised to break the balance and deliver a fatal blow to Liu Wenhui. After one battle, Jiading fell; after another, Angdong and Dayi were captured. Famous mountains were occupied, and Ya'an and Tianquan were included. By this point, Liu Wenhui was like a fish out of water, unable to move freely. Furthermore, the capture of his trusted division commander, Chen Hongwen, and the execution of the brave officer Shi Zhaowu, made him feel even more hopeless. Having no one to rely on, he had no choice but to ask Liu Xiang for a final peace agreement, with the condition of retreating into Kangding to preserve his existence. Now, Liu Xiang is holding meetings in Chengdu, seemingly celebrating the successful unification of Sichuan. Will the people of Sichuan, who have just taken a breath after this chaos, finally be able to escape from the water and fire and find a place of comfort?</p>
<p>Based on our observations, the future of Sichuan Province may not be entirely optimistic. Liu Xiang, due to a confluence of events, received the trust of the central government and wields military power, controlling various generals. In a short period, he was able to push Liu Wenhui beyond the borders of Sichuan. He is pleased with the current smooth lack of military progress, which cannot be without some smugness. However, Yang Sen and Liu Cunhou have long been engaged in military activities and hold considerable military power. They are not mere subordinates and are inherently difficult to control. When pressed by a common enemy, they were able to work together. However, once the common goal is removed, selfish thoughts will naturally arise. How could these individuals, witnessing Liu Xiang's self-satisfaction, submissively obey him and consistently support him? Once the distribution of benefits becomes uneven and disagreements arise, it would not be difficult to reignite conflict and seek to annex territory again. Before the flower of peace has bloomed, the prelude to another conflict begins. Understanding what the history of Sichuan's transformations and evolutions has shown us, our speculation today should not be considered alarmist.</p>
<p>However, the people of Sichuan have already suffered so much that there are few survivors left. Surely, the melon of Huangtai should not be picked again. If there are military personnel who possess a relatively enlightened mind and a strategic vision, then now is an excellent opportunity to consolidate military affairs and allow the people to recuperate. For Liu Xiang's sake, we suggest that he deeply suppress his own feelings and cultivate friendly relations with the generals, clearly informing them that the livelihood of the Sichuan people is on the verge of collapse and cannot withstand further exploitation. He should thoroughly wash away past mistakes and plan for the future together, aligning with the people's will to seek understanding, eliminating harsh taxes to allow them to recover. Those who are hungry will easily find food, and those who are thirsty will easily find drink. After years of turmoil, the people of Sichuan do not have high expectations of the authorities. If they are given a little comfort and support, will they not be inspired, motivated, grateful, and supportive? Once the people's hearts are won and the position is gradually solidified, then use military force in cooperation with the people to protect industry and promote production, gradually leading the province onto the path of development. Sichuan Province has long been known as the "Land of Abundance." Aquatic products and animal husbandry are abundant, and medicinal herbs and tobacco are rich. Coal, salt, copper, iron, and other resources are particularly profitable. If these resources can be properly developed, the province will have inexhaustible resources. Not only can prosperity be expected, but if not, if the tendency to spread chaos is used as a basis for escalating conflict, the disastrous consequences will inevitably occur. Who can escape the resulting calamity? How can feathers attach to skin that does not exist? A clear understanding of the advantages and disadvantages and careful consideration of the long-term plan is what the Sichuan military personnel should strive for.</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>"To the esteemed managers of the Shanghai Shenbao newspaper: The heavens have brought misfortune upon Yingyi County, with repeated calamities. Floods raged the year before last, and communist bandits ran rampant last year. Before the people's suffering could be alleviated, another strange disaster struck. Ferocious bandits from the Henan border circled around Fuyang, their howls and screeches causing alarm and horror. In the areas they passed through, people, regardless of wealth, were either killed or kidnapped. Homes, grain, clothing, and tools were all burned and looted. Women were violated, and men were subjected to cruel torture. Burning, killing, and looting were rampant. Since entering the county on August 4th until fleeing west on the 11th, they ravaged villages and towns, large and small, within a radius of hundreds of li. They occupied Nanzhao Village, a major town in the county, for seven days. Before leaving, they coerced and kidnapped approximately 8,000 men and women. Fewer than 2,000 have returned; the fate of the rest remains unknown. The corpses of those killed filled ditches and littered the fields. The Red Swastika Society buried 1,007 corpses after the chaos. The number of those not buried, consumed by the sun or vultures, is countless. Upon surveying the villages and towns through which the bandits passed, no family was left unscathed. Some families were even completely wiped out. The chaos of the Xianfeng and Tongzhi eras of the Qing Dynasty has returned today. The cruelty of Zhang Xianzhong's disaster in the late Ming Dynasty is the same. Fortunately, a large army joined forces to suppress the bandits, who have fled far away. Those scattered in all directions are gradually returning to their homelands. However, the villages are in ruins, like homeless swallows. The remaining grain is ashes, like hungry geese. In the scorching sun, their bellies rumble. They rest under dilapidated walls, sleeping in the open all night. The wind and rain offer no shelter, and hunger provides no sustenance. The cries of children and the laments of the elderly are heart-wrenching. The gaunt and haggard faces are heartbreaking to see. The surviving remnants are barely clinging to life. The days ahead are difficult, and relief is desperately needed. We humbly present to your compassionate attention the true situation of the bandit disaster in our county and attach photographs of the tragic conditions in the affected areas. We implore your esteemed newspaper to publish them to spread awareness, to move the compassion of benevolent people, to invite the generous donation of relief grain, to save lives and create merit greater than building a seven-story pagoda, to rescue those in disaster and bring benefit to all the people. With utmost eagerness and gratitude, [signed] Yan Fengyun, Chairman of the Finance Committee of Yingyi County; Li Jiedong, Director of the Education Bureau; Yang Yunpo, Representative of the Six Guilds; Xu Jinghan, President of the Yingyi Branch of the World Red Swastika Society; Tang Sufeng, Member of the County Water Conservancy Engineering Committee; and Jing Pu, Representative of [Illegible] District."</p>

<p>America Begins Major Ship Building Program</p>
<h3>The Final Twelve Contracts Signed, Showing Ambition to Dominate the World's Navy</h3>
<p>This American Move Poses a Great Threat to Japan</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, U.S. Secretary of the Navy,史潢生 (Shi Huangsheng), signed the contract for the final twelve ships of the new thirty-two ship construction program. 史氏 (Shi) and naval experts were particularly careful in reviewing the designs for these twelve ships, hence the delay in signing the construction contract until today. However, the designs and blueprints for these thirty-two warships have been underway by experts since the close of the London Naval Conference. Except for some minor details, the designs were largely completed before the bidding process, allowing for a faster completion than usual shipbuilding. (1st, Kuomin Daily Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Navy's supplementary plan for thirty-two warships, plus the five already approved by Congress, totaling thirty-seven warships, has been decided to commence construction. Secretary of the Navy 史潢生 (Shi Huangsheng) signed the construction plan on the 1st, thereby realizing the U.S.'s major shipbuilding program. Twenty-one ships will be built by private shipyards, and sixteen by naval shipyards. In addition, two ships are already under construction. In the future, the U.S. Navy will have added thirty-nine elite warships upon completion. When signing, 史潢生 (Shi Huangsheng) made a statement, saying, "I hope this shipbuilding program will be the first step towards building a navy that is the best in the world, within the limits set by the London Naval Treaty. Building warships within the limits permitted by the London Treaty can create the world's number one navy." President Roosevelt not only felt the need for an elite navy but was also concerned with relieving unemployment. The commencement of shipbuilding will provide jobs for a large number of unemployed people. Furthermore, 史潢生 (Shi Huangsheng) stated that cruisers will be named after years, gunboats after wars, aircraft carriers after ancient ship names, destroyers after naval officers, and submarines after deep-sea fish.</p>
<p>(1st, Japan United Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese naval insiders made the following observations regarding the implementation of the U.S.'s major shipbuilding program: "The U.S.'s current shipbuilding plan is expected to be completed before the revision of the London Treaty in 1935, two years from now. This substantial U.S. approach to the 5:3 ratio against Japan is truly beyond our expectations. When Japan signed the London Treaty, it did not expect the U.S. to implement such a rapid expansion of its navy. Although the numerical ratio is 5:3, the spirit of the treaty is an extension of the ten-year naval holiday recognized by the 1922 Washington Treaty. 史潢生 (Shi Huangsheng) said that the U.S.'s goal is to create the world's number one navy. If the U.S. attends future naval conferences with this spirit, the outcome is deeply concerning. Japan's second supplementary plan, implemented due to such stimulation from the U.S., is a passive action. From 史潢生 (Shi Huangsheng)'s words, we can infer that the U.S. will implement an even larger plan than this one in the future." (2nd, Japan United Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Naval Ministry spokesman 關根 (Sekine) stated today that the Japanese navy is not particularly concerned about the U.S. Navy's decision to move its Atlantic Fleet to the Pacific. However, reports that the U.S. naval authorities believe Japan is constructing naval bases on South Pacific islands under the guise of commercial needs, intending to dominate the Pacific, and therefore feel the need to curb its ambition, are inaccurate. Japan's current activities on the mandated islands in the South Pacific are solely for the purpose of facilitating the development of these islands. This facilitation is by no means military in nature. An Englishman, 包德萊 (Baudelaire), who recently visited these islands, fully acknowledged this point. In summary, Japan governs these islands as part of Japanese territory and has the freedom to develop them. It is unnecessary for other countries to criticize the development of a part of the Japanese Empire. (2nd, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italian-Russian Non-Aggression Pact Signed</h3>
<p>The Italo-Russian Treaty of Friendship, Non-Aggression, and Neutrality was signed at noon at the Venice Palace. The preamble states that the purpose of the treaty is to maintain universal peace and, as decided by the two governments, to agree not to interfere in each other's internal affairs. Article 1 stipulates that the governments of the contracting states shall not resort to force under any circumstances. Article 2 stipulates that if one of the contracting states has a conflict with other countries, the other contracting state shall remain neutral. If one of the contracting states commits aggression against a third country, the other contracting state may declare the termination of this treaty. Article 3 stipulates that neither of the contracting states shall discriminate against the other in economic or commercial matters and agrees not to adopt any measures that exclude the goods of the contracting states from foreign markets.</p>
<p>Article 4 stipulates that both contracting states agree not to participate in any political or economic agreements that harm one of the contracting states. Article 5 stipulates that this treaty does not restrict or modify the obligations previously entered into by the contracting states with other countries. The term of validity of this treaty is set at five years. If termination is desired before the expiration date, notice must be given one year in advance of the expiration date.

<h3>U.S. Government Expands Lending to Promote Industrial Recovery</h3>
<p>Low-Interest Supply of Cash and Credit to Banks</p>
<p>Establishment of a Central Statistical Bureau to Manage Production</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. government is currently injecting money and credit into banks to prevent the exhaustion of funds and to allow banks to assist industry and commerce. This plan, decided today through consultation between officials from the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (i.e., the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation), has begun to be implemented. The content is quite detailed, stipulating that member banks directly borrowing from the Federal Reserve System can use rediscount notes. The 800 million yuan already lent to banks by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, originally at an interest rate of 4.5%, will now be reduced to 4%. At the same time, the Federal Reserve Board will also ease the convenience of rediscounting. Rediscount notes that cannot be used as bank reserves can be borrowed from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Secretary of the Treasury 阿哲森 (Acheson) stated that banks will have a large amount of lending available to assist industry and commerce in starting plans to increase wages and reduce working hours. Lending in the domestic market this week expanded again due to the Federal Reserve Board purchasing 35 million yuan in public bonds. The government can provide all the lending needed to assist industry and commerce and will strive to make it easier to borrow this lending at low interest rates. (1st, Kuomin Daily Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, in addition to starting the implementation of a large-scale expanded lending plan, the U.S. government has also established a Central Statistical Bureau by the Industrial Recovery Administration. Each of the Department of Labor, the Department of Interior, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Industrial Recovery Administration will send one person as a commissioner. The purpose of establishing this bureau is to enable the government to know the actual progress of industry at any time, so that the President can implement production management when necessary. The main purpose of the U.S. President's recovery plan is to seek a balanced increase in production and consumption, and this new agency is to statistically manage both sides so that production does not exceed consumption and regenerate surplus. Previously, although each department and bureau had statistics, they each sought their own gains and were not unified. This bureau will combine and comprehensively manage what is already available and add what is lacking, striving to have a clear understanding of the national livelihood.

<h3>Number of People Returning to Work Still Below Expectations</h3>
<p>(Washington) Since the U.S. launched the movement to shorten working hours, how many of its 12 million unemployed people have actually found work is currently a hotly debated point. General Johnson estimates that since this movement occurred, 2 million people have returned to work. Labor Union President Green refutes this claim, saying that approximately 500,000 people returned to work in July, but there is no clear evidence that unemployed people have been placed since then. Other estimates place the number of people returning to work at approximately 1 million. However, in any case, the number of people returning to work is far from Johnson's recent expectation that 5 to 6 million people would return to work before September. At the same time, the cost of living is gradually increasing. Although official estimates have not been released, general prices have risen by 6.5% from April to July. (1st, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Automotive King Still Has Not Complied</h3>
<p>(Washington) Rumors say that automotive king Ford will not sign the automotive industry code. The deadline for his signature acknowledging the code will expire on September 5. Ford will issue a statement to the public at that time, explaining the reasons for his refusal to sign. Another message says Ford intends to seek a solution based on profit sharing with workers. However, Ford factory managers do not want to express anything about this message. (1st, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Two Difficulties Facing the Recovery Movement</h3>
<p>(Washington) Transportation industry organizer Eastman has written to President Roosevelt, advising against applying the recovery plan to railways. (2nd, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The dispute over labor policy and the ambiguity of automotive king Ford's opinion are the major problems currently encountered by the recovery movement. After Eastman wrote to the U.S. President, Railway Labor Executive Association Chairman Whitney published an article, saying that he will immediately seek to shorten working hours and reduce wages to avoid railways having no place in the recovery plan. At the same time, coal mine owners and miners are at an impasse regarding the provision in the industry code that hiring is based on work ability and not membership in a labor union. (2nd, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Child Labor System Becomes a Historical Relic</h3>
<p>(New York) The National Recovery Agreement on child labor, which is now being implemented simultaneously with the cotton textile industry code, will be the prelude to the abolition of child labor in the United States. Agriculture and the cotton industry have always employed the most child labor. Those who have not reached adulthood are now not being accepted. The permanent codes of other industries also mostly follow this practice. Today is the final day limited by officials to submit industry codes. (2nd, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hurricane Passes Through Cuba</h3>
<p>Flying Bricks and Tiles Obstruct Traffic</p>
<p>Sugar Cane Harvest Suffers Heavy Losses</p>
<p>The hurricane blew through the northern coast of Cuba and re-entered the sea tonight. The disaster situation is quite serious. Within the capital, bricks and tiles were flying around the streets, injuring seventy pedestrians and killing one person. Telegraph, telephone, and power lines have all been cut off. Most wooden houses have collapsed. When the wind was at its strongest, trams, cars, and buses could not run. At night, part of the capital became a dark zone. The areas most severely affected this time were from here to 又桑泰克勒拉 (You Sangtaikelela). The hurricane passed through the interior of 桑泰克勒拉 (Sangtaikelela) Province, destroying many houses and sugar factories. The sugar cane harvest suffered heavy losses. Bandits even took advantage of the wind to loot in 桑泰克勒拉 (Sangtaikelela) City. Police captured five people and immediately shot them as a warning to the public. Bricks and tiles killed two people and injured approximately forty people in that area. Torrential rain poured down where the wind passed, and warehouses and retail stores suffered water damage losses. Several small boats sank in the harbor, and two large freighters broke their moorings and drifted with the waves, fearing they could not be saved. Fortunately, the scope of the hurricane was not wide, and there are no reports of disasters on other islands. The speed of the wind reached 110 miles per hour at its strongest, but when it blew through 哈伐那 (Havana) tonight, its speed had decreased to below 40 miles per hour.

<h3>Mexico Notifies Revision of Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>Abolishing Special Treatment for Japanese Residents</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan-Mexico Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, due to the situation in Mexico at the time of the treaty's conclusion, held an anti-American and pro-Japanese attitude. Therefore, Japanese people received the same treatment as mainlanders in Mexico and enjoyed mainlanders' treatment. Recently, the United States, Britain, and France have also imitated this request for mainlander treatment. Mexican workers also oppose Japan's special privileges. Therefore, the Mexican government, with a one-month notice period, proposed to the Japanese government, through the minister stationed in Mexico, to revise the mainlander treatment clause. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers this a loss of the vested rights of the Japanese, so it is discussing countermeasures with a cautious attitude. (2nd, Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Russian Oil Arrives in Japan</h3>
<p>British and American Merchants Find It Difficult to Compete</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The second batch of Soviet Russian oil, totaling 9,000 tons, transported by Japanese merchant 松方幸次郎 (Matsukata Kōjirō) from Baku, arrived in Tokyo this morning on a Norwegian oil tanker. The first batch of Russian oil, 11,000 tons, was extremely welcomed. After appearing on the market, only two days passed before 25,000 gallons were sold. Car owners love to use Russian oil to replace Shell British oil. The Japanese oil market has been exclusively held by the British, American, and Japanese oil industries. Now, Russian oil is gradually invading. Therefore, the British, American, and Japanese oil industries are competing fiercely against it. Yokohama City and 鏺道 (Fudao) Province are now purchasing Russian oil. (2nd, Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>First Day of the Nazi Party Congress</h3>
<p>Reading the Names of Fallen Comrades</p>
<p>The Venue Was Filled With a Tragic Atmosphere</p>
<p>Reuters, Nuremberg, 1st. Today, the National Socialist Party held its first congress here after gaining power. 15,000 people attended. Mr. Hess presented a tragic scene, and National Socialist Party Chief of Staff Röhm read the names of hundreds of people who had died for the party throughout its history. During the reading, drums kept the rhythm, and the crowd stood silently. Behind Röhm stood a Stormtrooper member, holding aloft the bloodstained flag of the failed 1923 Hitler-Ludendorff putsch. Hess hosted the guests, especially warmly towards the representatives of Mussolini's Fascist Party, saying that the presence of the Fascist Party representatives was proof of Italo-German friendship. Hess predicted that the National Socialist Party's victory in the future would be even greater than today and praised Hitler as the guarantor of Germany's final victory in the future.</p>
<h3>Austria Expands Military Strength</h3>
<p>Exchange of Notes with Britain, France, and Italy</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 2nd. Regarding the establishment of an auxiliary force in Austria, the cabinets in Vienna, London, Rome, and Paris have exchanged documents. The Austrian government sent the same note to Italy, Britain, and France, and the governments of those three countries sent the same reply to Austria. The Austrian chargé d'affaires to France, in his note to French Foreign Minister Peng Gu, strongly stated that Austria's current military strength is insufficient to cope with internal and external situations. To maintain order and public security and to immediately curb all terrorist acts within the country or at the border, it is necessary to take special surveillance measures. These terrorist acts, whether committed by domestic terrorists or coming from abroad, are worrisome. It is insufficient to simply expand the gendarmerie and police force. It is also difficult to increase the federal army to 30,000 due to budgetary reasons. Therefore, the Austrian government has decided to establish an auxiliary force as the best strategy to cope with the situation. The note then describes the nature of the auxiliary force, saying that its purpose is to maintain internal order and public security, and to assist border police in the event of disasters and serious incidents, and to cooperate with them. The period of existence of this auxiliary force is limited to one year, but if the Disarmament Conference has other agreements, this will not be taken as an example. This auxiliary force will become part of Austria's military strength, subordinate to the Ministry of Military Affairs, and under the command of the military authorities. Its members, combined with the official army, will not exceed the 30,000 limit stipulated by the Treaty of Saint-Germain. Its service period is set at six months, and it is a volunteer force. Its training will be undertaken by the federal army. During their active duty period, the state will provide them with weapons, clothing, food, and barracks.</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 1st. The "Austrian Evening News" published here stated that the Austrian government will transfer 1,500 "Defense Corps" members to the German-Austrian border within the next few days to assist the gendarmerie in strengthening border defenses. The "Defense Corps" is an elite team selected from the Austrian auxiliary police.</p>

<h3>Former British Foreign Secretary Henderson Resumes Political Activities</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st. 漢德森 (Henderson), who was quite famous in British politics in the past, has been resurrected today, hoping to re-enter the political arena. 漢 (Han) was the Foreign Secretary in the previous Labor Cabinet, and then served as Chairman of the Disarmament Conference. Today, he was re-elected by the Labor Party as a candidate for the National Assembly. 漢 (Han) left Parliament after failing in the previous general election, but it was known at the time that he would definitely make a comeback. Because the largest number of votes in the previous Labor election was 955.1 million, but this time, there are Nationalist candidate Moore and Communist candidate 僕尼托 (Punito) competing with him. The results will be known this Saturday.</p>

<h3>Request from Businessmen and Residents of the North China War Zone for Tax Reduction and Exemption</h3>
<p>=Enumerating Losses During the Military Period=</p>
<p>=Requesting Tax Exemption to Alleviate Business Difficulties=</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The losses suffered by businessmen and residents in the 19 counties of the Hebei Province war zone during this foreign war and the subsequent disturbances caused by bandits are unprecedentedly tragic. As a result, the businessmen and residents of various counties have appointed their chambers of commerce as representatives to come to Tianjin one after another to appeal to the authorities to consider their difficulties, exempt them from business tax, return the advances made for military supplies, and reduce or exempt miscellaneous taxes and levies. Currently, a total of 31 representatives have arrived in Tianjin. They gathered once yesterday and planned to go to the provincial government and the three bureaus of civil affairs, finance, and industry at 9:00 am today (the 31st) to present a joint petition. Then, they will go to Beiping to appeal to various authorities. The text of the representatives' petition to the provincial government is recorded below:</p>
<p>"We present this petition regarding the exceptionally severe disaster suffered by the war zone and the extreme hardship of the businessmen and residents, earnestly requesting your esteemed review and approval to exempt taxes and levies, return advances, compensate for losses, and suppress banditry, thereby showing your relief efforts. The counties in the war zone have historically maintained close commercial ties with the three northeastern provinces. Since the September 18th Incident, transportation to and from the Northeast has been cut off, and business in various counties has greatly declined. When Yuguan was lost and Rehe fell, large armies gathered in Pingdong, Pingbei, Luandong, and Luanxi, causing widespread panic and a complete cessation of trade. The military's requisitions were as urgent as a fire. All supplies and items of support were the responsibility of the merchants. Even if they were exhausted, they were not allowed to stop operating. They could only provide supplies reluctantly and endure the pain of losing their goods. As the war spread and the Japanese puppet troops advanced, they treated the places they reached as conquered territories, extorting and demanding from the merchants without restraint. Any delay was met with beatings and scolding, and even minor offenses resulted in injury. The defeated soldiers and bandits mixed together were even more inhumane and exceptionally cruel. The counties they passed through suffered terrible devastation. Money and goods were looted completely, burning houses was seen as a joke, and killing people was treated as child's play. Wherever they went, nine out of ten houses were empty. This catastrophe was truly tragic. From the start of the fighting at Yuguan to the day the government regained control, more than half a year passed. The merchants and residents lived in dire straits, and their suffering was beyond description and imagination. The losses in each county ranged from several million yuan to no less than several hundred thousand yuan. How could merchants who had been declining for years have the strength to bear this heavy burden? Although the war has stopped, the bandits have risen again in the devastated areas, and people are still in fear. There is no hope for the future of business, and recovery is unlikely within ten years. Recently, the local authorities have been concerned about the war zone and have made great efforts to provide relief. They have already exempted land taxes and provided emergency relief to the residents. However, how to provide relief to the merchants has not yet been mentioned. It must be thought that the residents are in more urgent need of assistance, and the merchants can wait. They do not know that in the event of a flood or drought, the residents suffer greater losses, but in the event of war and banditry, the merchants suffer greater losses. Military supplies are first the responsibility of the merchants, and bandits also first target merchants for looting. If relief is not provided, those who have suffered too much loss will naturally be unable to operate, and even those who have suffered less loss will be in danger of related bankruptcies. If the market cannot be maintained and finances cannot be managed, both merchants and residents will inevitably be in distress. It is known that the merchants' need for assistance is even more urgent than that of the residents. The representatives respectfully present the request for relief in detail: 1. Please exempt business tax for two years to alleviate business difficulties. It is reported that the State Council meeting decided to exempt all business taxes payable by the counties in the war zone during the period of combat to show sympathy. This demonstrates the concern for the merchants' difficulties, and we are deeply grateful. However, the income from business tax is originally based on the amount of business done to determine the amount of tax to be paid. If the merchants can do more business and pay more taxes, they will be happy to do so, because they will earn more than the tax paid. If there is no business during the war, how can taxes be paid? It is the same as not being exempted. After the war, the losses are too great, the local area is devastated, the market is depressed, the merchants lack capital, and the people's livelihood is difficult. People are unable to buy goods, and the amount of business will inevitably plummet. How can the taxes be paid? Even if there are goods in stock, in order to free up capital, they must be sold at a loss. If they have to pay taxes again, wouldn't it be even more difficult? Moreover, the fighting in Shanghai lasted only one month, and the affected area was limited to Zhabei and Jiangwan. Afterwards, the business tax for the entire port was exempted for one year. The disaster in this war zone is a hundred times that of Shanghai. If we are abandoned and not helped, it would be unfair. In addition to the exemption for the second half of the 21st year, which was already in the period of combat, we earnestly request that the business tax for the 22nd and 23rd years be completely exempted to alleviate business difficulties. Moreover, only a dozen counties in the war zone are requesting exemption, which will result in a small reduction in the provincial treasury, but the merchants in the war zone will be able to recover, and the benefits will be immeasurable. Furthermore, wine merchants have never paid business tax, but pay special taxes and levies. This time, the war has caused particularly heavy losses to wine merchants' courtyards and grain stocks. Please also exempt the wine tax and levies from October 1st of this year to the end of September next year for one year to ensure that everyone benefits equally. 2. Please exempt the weighing and measuring taxes and miscellaneous taxes to eliminate the suffering of merchants and residents. The tax on brokers is mostly collected by contractors on behalf of the government. Not only are the demands harsh and detailed, but they are often arbitrarily increased, causing great harm to merchants and residents. The government receives very little, and most of it goes into the private pockets of the contractors, while the merchants suffer greatly. In recent years, the political authorities have repeatedly issued clear orders to exempt taxes and levies on items related to the people's clothing and food, such as native cloth and grain, to alleviate the people's difficulties. Now, after surviving the war, there is no hope of recovery. They are unable to pay taxes and levies, let alone bear the burden of these miscellaneous taxes. Please exempt them all to eliminate the suffering of merchants and residents. 3. Please return the advances made for military supplies in full to ease the burden on merchants and residents. During this emergency military situation, transportation was delayed. The Beiping Military Commission telegraphed various counties to instruct the merchants and residents to temporarily advance supplies of food and provisions, and that they would be returned afterwards. Subsequently, the Beiping Military Commission branch issued Instruction No. 3744, directing the government to open a section to check and report the number of grain and grass requisitioned by a certain army and the amount of unpaid prices for transfer and repayment. In addition, the Beiping Military Commission issued a telegram to the government, instructing various counties to present receipts for any items and funds advanced, as well as vehicles and horses, to claim repayment. The government issued telegrams to all counties to comply with the instructions. These supplies were all given receipts by the relevant armies and were purely in the nature of advances. Please allocate the funds for repayment in full. In addition, it is said that when the Guojun Army occupied the area, it was also agreed to allocate funds for repayment of the advances for supplies required. Please allocate the funds for repayment together to ease the burden on merchants and residents. 4. Please cancel the quota for stamp tax to avoid burdening merchants. The stamp tax regulations only require uniform use and do not specify a quota. However, in order to increase sales, the stamp tax bureau does not hesitate to force merchants to set a quota. When business is booming, the monthly sales are not much different from the set quota. Now, due to war and banditry, the market is depressed. If the quota is assigned again, most of it will inevitably be accumulated. Merchants who are barely surviving have no money to compensate. Please cancel the quota to avoid burdening merchants. 5. Please allocate funds to relieve losses to make up for them. In addition to the advances for supplies, the merchants suffered various losses in this battle, including vehicles, packhorses, timber and stones needed to build fortifications, hired laborers, meals, and clothes and goods taken away by the army. Many have gone bankrupt as a result. Since residents have been given relief, merchants should not be left out. Please refer to the emergency relief measures and allocate funds for relief to make up for the losses. The difficult situation in the counties of the war zone must have been known for a long time. In recent days, the flames of banditry have been burning brighter, with killings, arson, and looting, turning villages into ruins. No town or city has been spared. The most severely affected areas are Qinhuangdao, where bad news is frequently reported, the situation in Tangshan is serious, and bandits are rampant throughout Luanfu and Changlin. If they are not suppressed quickly, the situation may become uncontrollable, and there will be no survivors in the war zone. The merchants and residents are all looking forward to the day when they will be wiped out. Please make every effort to find a solution. If the items requested by the representatives can be relieved to the greatest extent possible and the people can be saved from their suffering as soon as possible, the remaining merchants after the disaster may have hope of recovery. In addition to submitting separate reports, we should explain the situation of the disaster and prepare a list of losses. Please review and grant relief. We cannot bear the urgency of waiting for orders. We respectfully present this to Yu, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government." (31st)</p>
<h3>Fang Ji Separately Leave Chahar</h3>
<p>The Chahar North Issue is Largely Resolved</p>
<p>Xiao Zhenying Talks About the Aftermath of the Chahar Incident</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: The aftermath of the Chahar province mercenary army has been largely completed. Fang Zhenwu has now arrived at Dushikou, leading only Wang Zhongfu's 2,000-man division. Fang has expressed his willingness to hand over the troops to Song for reorganization, hoping that the government will first give him a considerable title. The authorities are studying and considering this. After Ji Hongchang, Zhang Mutao, and others led their troops to be surrounded by Zhang Lingyun's division in Daqinggou, they planned to go west to Shangdu and occupy the city. Song Zheyuan, upon hearing the report, sent a division of Wang Tuan and Gao Shuxun to follow and monitor them while ordering the Shangdu garrison to block and strictly defend them. Ji's division is now 20 li north of Daqinggou, or may still advance west. It is heard that Ji intends to leave Chahar and enter Suiyuan, taking a train from Pingdiquan to elsewhere. It is estimated that the problems of the Ji and Fang divisions can be completely resolved soon. Song Zheyuan will still advance from Zhangjiakou to Zhangbei within days to inspect the reorganized divisions. At the same time, because the troops north of Zhangjiakou are insufficient for distribution, he transferred Zhao Dengyu's division, which was originally stationed in Shijiazhuang, to Chahar. Zhao's division has arrived in Zhangjiakou and is awaiting further orders. In addition, Jiang Bocheng, who went to Zhangjiakou to assist Song in handling the aftermath, returned to Beiping by special train at 10 pm on the 28th after meeting with Song in Zhangbei because the aftermath was largely completed. Song Zheyuan's representative Xiao Zhenying and the commander of the 40th Army, Pang Bingxun, came to Beiping by the same train to meet with He Yingqin. According to Xiao Zhenying's talk about the aftermath of the Chahar incident, "Since Mr. Feng left Chahar, Fang Ji and others regrouped in Zhangbei and continued their activities. The number of troops reached 40,000, and their power should not be underestimated. After Chairman Song returned to Chahar for the second time, he convened a meeting of representatives of various armies in Zhangjiakou in accordance with the plan determined by the Military Commission to discuss the aftermath. Zhang Yunrong's and Ruan Xuanwu's divisions were willing to obey orders. Zhang's divisions were all troops under Mr. Feng's command, accounting for a large part of the troops in the Zhangbei area. Therefore, Fang Ji was isolated and had to leave Zhangbei. Chairman Song immediately advanced to Zhangbei to carry out appeasement and stabilize the people's hearts. Fang is now in Dushikou, and his intentions are unknown. I believe that the aftermath of Fang's division can be resolved within five or six days. The Wang Zhongfu division currently led by Fang has no real strength. Ji Hongchang's division has more than a thousand people, and there are not many guns. They appear to be fleeing to Shangdu. The area has been prepared, and it is difficult to enter the city even if they arrive. I believe it will be resolved soon. Zhang Lisheng's division is now in the Baochang area. His divisions are all militia groups, and they will be ordered to disband and return their guns to the local area. Zhang called Zhangbei and me on the evening of the 28th, expressing his hope to reorganize the troops and give them titles. He has been rejected because there is no room for more troops to be reorganized at this time. Chairman Song plans to go to Zhangbei again within days to inspect and end the aftermath as soon as possible. My return to Beiping is to report to the Acting Chairman on behalf of Chairman Song and discuss some matters. I will go to Shanghai on the evening of the 31st and then go to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Jiang," and so on. (31st)</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Breach of the Lankao Embankment and the Yellow River Water Flowing into Shandong</h3>
<p>A Conversation with a Military Officer from the Resident Yu Jing Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>Embankment Outbreaks in the Three Provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong Occurred Eleven Times</p>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: Recent reports have stated that representatives of the disaster victims in western Shandong have presented a petition stating, "The Henan provincial authorities sent troops to breach the embankment in Lankao, causing the Yellow River water to flow into western Shandong." Recently, a key military officer from the Resident Yu Jing Garrison Headquarters discussed the truth of the matter and the origins of the misunderstanding among the people of western Shandong, the main points of which are as follows: "Reports stated that the representatives of the disaster victims in Heze, Shou Zhang, and 18 counties in western Shandong, Han Jifu and others, telegraphed the central government to investigate the responsibility for the Yellow River breach, which involved the province's highest officer sending troops to breach the embankment in Lankao, resulting in the water flowing directly into western Shandong and causing a disaster. This is far from the truth and is a malicious slander. Director Liu serves the party and the country, and Shandong and Henan are one family, with no distinction between them. Treating one's neighbors as enemies is something that is done by bestial characters in feudal times. How could a modern revolutionary leader regress three thousand years and commit such an inhumane act? Director Liu does not want to argue because the facts are there. He has telegraphed the central government to thoroughly investigate and severely punish him. He has a clear conscience and is not harmed by the sun and moon. Since the press is paying attention to this, the reports from the magistrates and river affairs officials of the counties in eastern Henan, southern Hebei, and western Shandong and Han's telegram to the central government reporting the disaster in western Shandong, as published in the newspapers of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, are summarized and listed to prove the facts. Referring to the terrain, these wild words will be refuted by themselves. Now, the common sense of the people has made considerable progress. Try to review the newspapers for the past three weeks in order to see the truth. In August, the water level of the Yellow River rose particularly high. Only in the eastern Henan, southern Hebei, and western Shandong, the following incidents occurred on both sides of the river: 1. On August 2, two breaches were dug by bandits on the north bank of the Yellow River in Changyuan County, Hebei, causing flooding in Hua County, Puyang County, and other places. Lin Dancheng, chief of the fourth section of the Hebei River Affairs Bureau, and the magistrate of Changyuan County reported. 2. On August 11, the dikes of the Yellow River on the south bank of Lankao, Henan, at 1. Yuanzhai and 2. Zhenpu Village's old Yellow River mouth, overflowed. The overflow at Yuanzhai was about two li wide and one or two zhang deep, and the water flowed freely to Kaocheng. The overflow at Zhenpu Village was about one hundred zhang wide and one or two zhang deep, flowing along the old course of the Yellow River through Neihuang to Dangshan, Tongshan, Xiao Pi, Sui, and Feng counties in Jiangsu. The Henan River Affairs Bureau and the magistrate of Lankao County reported. 3. A total of four breaches above Shitou Village on the north bank of the Yellow River in Changyuan, Hebei, occurred on August 11, causing flooding in Hua County, Puyang, Shou Zhang, Fan County, and other counties. The Hebei, Shandong, and Henan River Affairs Bureau and the magistrates of the counties reported. 4. On August 11, the dike on the south bank of the Yellow River in Changyuan County, Hebei (adjacent to Dongming), in the second branch of the first section of Pang Zhuang in Erfen Village, breached. The breach was more than 50 zhang wide and one or two zhang deep. The water flowed from Dongming County to Dingtao, Heze, Juye, Chengwu, and Cao Dan counties in western Shandong, and into Jiaxiang, flowing eastward in three branches, one to Jining into the canal, one to Weishan Lake, and one to Cao County into the old course of the Xu Huang River into Jiangsu. Chen Wenmo, chief of the upstream section of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, Lin Dancheng, chief of the fourth section of the Hebei Provincial River Affairs Bureau, and Sun Zeriang, magistrate of Heze County, all reported to the governments or river affairs bureaus of Shandong and Hebei provinces separately. Chairman Han Xiangfang also telegraphed the national government and the Executive Yuan. 5. The breach at Dongjiaqiao, west of the river in Changqing County, occurred around August 15. The Shandong River Affairs Bureau and the county magistrate reported. 6. The breach at Maowangzhuang, Dong'e County, occurred at the same time. The Shandong River Affairs Bureau and the county magistrate reported. Based on the above observations, from August 2 to 20, the Yellow River from Lankao in eastern Henan to Dong'e and Changqing in western Shandong passed through the three provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong, with 5 counties and 11 broken dikes. By province, 2 breaches belonged to eastern Henan (Lankao), 7 breaches belonged to southern Hebei, and 2 breaches belonged to Shandong. By north and south bank, 6 breaches belonged to the north bank of the Yellow River, and 5 breaches belonged to the south bank of the Yellow River. In terms of the cause of the incident, 2 breaches were due to river water overflowing the dikes (2 in Lankao), 7 breaches were due to river water breaking the dikes, and 2 breaches were due to bandits breaking the dikes. In terms of the trend of the water, the water overflowing from Lankao flowed along the old course of the Yellow River, and the counties and districts flooded were primarily Lankao, Kaocheng, Shangqiu, Yucheng, and Xiayi in eastern Henan, and Tongshan, Feng County, Dangshan, and Kunyu in Jiangsu. The borders of Cao Dan counties in western Shandong were also slightly affected. The breach on the south bank of the Yellow River in Changyuan was the main cause of the disaster in Cao counties in western Shandong today. In terms of time, the breach on the south bank of the Yellow River in Changyuan and the overflow of the Yellow River in Lankao both occurred on August 11. The most strange thing is that the representatives of the disaster victims in more than a dozen counties in western Shandong did not closely observe the main cause of the disaster, which was the breach on the south bank of the Yellow River between Changyuan and Dongming, but falsely claimed that the overflow in Lankao was caused by troops breaching the dike. Why abandon the near and take the far, close your eyes and believe your ears? We should observe the facts based on time and space and refer to geography and personnel. Overflowing dikes and breaching dikes have their own signs. Natural breaches and human-caused breaches should also be heard and seen. If the military officers of Henan Province sent troops to Lankao to breach the dike, the disaster victims in Lankao, Kaocheng, and eastern Henan would be the first to oppose it. Why wait for the representatives of the disaster victims in western Shandong to expose it? Now, try to investigate the disaster areas in Lankao, Kaocheng, and other counties in eastern Henan. Is there anyone who admits that the flood in Lankao was caused by a soldier digging the dike at the scene of the accident? The words of a few people cannot cover the ears and eyes of thousands of people. Temporary false propaganda cannot overcome the passage of the natural disaster that has been circulating for dozens of days. The facts are there. We will quietly wait for the central government's thorough investigation and the public's judgment." (August 30)</p>
<h3>Xie Gangzhe Goes to Beiping to Report on the Navy Reorganization</h3>
<p>The Naval Headquarters Has Been Moved to Weihaiwei</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Xie Gangzhe, commander of the Third Fleet of the Navy, arrived in Jinan from Qingdao at 7:45 this morning (1st). After getting off the train, he took a car with Wen Chenglie to Jinde to meet Han. According to Xie, the mission of this trip and the recent situation of the navy are roughly as follows: Because the reorganization of the navy has been completed, I am going to Beiping to meet with Chairman He to report on the reorganization process and coastal security. After meeting with Chairman Han today, I will take the Pingpu train north at 6 pm. The naval headquarters and training team have been moved to Weihaiwei. Other subordinate units, such as the surveying team, aircraft team, and naval landing force, are still stationed in Qingdao. However, they were previously stationed in the city and have now been moved to the outskirts of Qingdao, stationed along the coast of Jimo and Chengyang counties. There are two reasons for moving to Weihai: First, Weihai is located in a remote area, which is suitable for training and education. The navy and the local residents get along very well. Second, Qingdao is a prosperous city, and it is inevitable that soldiers who have lived there for a long time will become extravagant, which is not suitable in the long run. Qingdao has become increasingly prosperous recently, and the population has reached 500,000, which is even more unsuitable for soldiers to mix in. Moreover, after Mayor Shen resigned from his position as commander, he tried to separate the military and the people in order to clarify the powers and responsibilities. After I report to He in Beiping, I will go to Beijing to report to the Navy Department. After that, I will return to Weihai, etc. (1st)</p>
<h3>Bandit Qi Ruiwu Executed by Firing Squad in Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Suzhou-Songjiang Bandit Suppression Command executed a bandit named Qi Ruiwu by firing squad at Wangshudun, outside the Lümen gate, at 2 pm yesterday (2nd). Qi, whose given name was Buwu, was 30 years old and from Yancheng. He used to be an agent under Xu Biaofengshan's detective team in the command. After being dismissed this spring, he joined the bandits. In May, he was captured by Xu and others at the Yufeng Inn in Xumen. According to his confession, he colluded with the fugitive Hu San Xiaofanzi, Zhou Zhenfang, and others, from Wuxi to Suzhou, to rob at Jiapu Bridge, burn and injure the shopkeeper, kidnap small hostages, and extort huge sums of money. After the execution yesterday (2nd), his wife and mother went to the scene to weep over the body, which was extremely sad.</p>
<h3>Meat Merchants in Zhenze, Wujiang Go on Strike Due to Increased Taxes</h3>
<p>There are 24 fresh meat stores in Zhenze Town, which belongs to the county. They have been paying a slaughter tax of 270 yuan per month for many years. In July of this year, Tang Shouyi won the bid to take over the slaughter tax in the county. The meat merchants in the county have already sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce to forward to the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office, requesting a 20% reduction due to sluggish business. The reply was that the bidding had not increased this time, and the requested reduction could not be approved. However, Tang began to illegally increase taxes in the Pingwang area as soon as he took over, which led to the meat merchants stopping business. Now, Zhenze has to increase the tax amount again, and all the meat merchants in the town have gone on strike. Yesterday, the meat merchants in Zhenze telegraphed their counterparts in various districts to unite and help each other. It is now rumored that the trend is expanding, and the meat merchants have scheduled an emergency meeting in Jiang on the 5th to discuss how to deal with the situation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou-Jiaxing Buses Temporarily Run to Shengze</h3>
<p>After the inauguration ceremony, the Suzhou-Jiaxing long-distance buses only ran to Wujiang, Beima, Pingwang, and other places. Now, Shengze, which belongs to the county, is the leading town in the county, and its business is very prosperous. Now, because of the local custom of the Ghost Festival in the lunar calendar, there is a children's competition, which is very popular. All circles in the town specially telegraphed the Suzhou-Jiaxing Long-Distance Bus Preparatory Office to request the extension of the bus route to Shengze to facilitate transportation. Director Zhu approved the request, and it has been decided to extend the route to Shengze from September 2. The County Government Executes Two Kidnappers The bandits Lei Xiaohai and Li San (ie Li San Mazi) kidnapped two children named Zhang from Changtiangang, Beima, and more than 20 people, including a monk from Donglin Temple, Pan Shucheng, and Pan Aizhen from Damaogang, in this county. Five or six people were killed, and the Jiaxing Xinji Dongshan and other ships were robbed, and more than 20 long and short guns from the water police were robbed. He Linchun, the captain of the county's permanent patrol team, dispatched detectives to arrest them one after another. After being interrogated in the county, they confessed without denying. The county telegraphed the provincial government, and the death penalty was approved. After the county government received the telegram at 9 am today (2nd), Magistrate Wang signed and提* the two criminals, verified their identities, tied them to the execution ground outside the East Gate, and executed them by firing squad.</p>
<p>*Note:提 is likely 簽提 (qiān tí), which refers to signing off on the order to bring the criminals forth.</p>
<h3>Watchmen and Gang Members Murdered in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Fan Qingzhi, a gang member of the watchman Zha Yongfa from Huishan Town in this county, was from Yancheng and was about 20 years old. He patrolled diligently every night. On the evening of the 30th of last month, Fan went out to patrol as usual, but never returned. Suddenly, he was reported missing. In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, about 7 or 8 children were playing by the Ba River under Jiulong Peak near Wulijie in Huishan Town when they suddenly saw a male corpse standing upright in the river. The children were shocked and screamed wildly, alarming the nearby residents, who went to watch and found that it was Fan Qingzhi's corpse. They reported it to the fourth branch of the local public security bureau and notified Jiang Zixian, the head of the 26th ward, to report to the county court. At about 11 am yesterday (2nd), Prosecutor Shen led Wang, the coroner, and bailiffs to the scene for an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that the deceased had a fist wound on his back, and there were marks of cloth straps around both hands and chest. He was injured before falling into the river and dying. The prosecutor's office is now investigating the murderer.</p>
<h3>Peddler Commits Suicide After Gambling Loss</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhongyi, who lives in the house west of Zhang Yaoding, a shanty dweller from Jiangbei, in front of the Public Stadium outside the West Gate, used to be a policeman. He now sets up a candy stall in front of the stadium to make a living. However, Zhang Zhongyi likes to gamble. Recently, he lost all his capital, so he could not do business. He suddenly had the idea of ​​ending his life. He hanged himself in bed the night before. Yesterday, Chen Zizhao, the head of the ward, reported to the county court and requested to send someone for an autopsy. After Prosecutor Shen went to the scene for an autopsy, he ordered his brother to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Winter Grain Tax Surcharge Suspension</h3>
<p>The local county party headquarters, various public organizations, and district chiefs, noting that since the Jiangsu Province levied a surcharge of two yuan per shi (unit of dry measure) on winter grain tax starting from the 17th year of the Republic, there was only one year of suspension in the 18th year. The levy continued in the 19th, 20th, and 21st years. Recently, they heard that the provincial government had submitted another request to the Executive Yuan to continue levying the surcharge in the 22nd year. Therefore, they specifically telegraphed officials in Nanjing and Zhenjiang, as well as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requesting a swift halt and permanent abolishment of this item. Yesterday, they received instructions from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, directing them to directly submit a request to the Executive Yuan for review and action. However, according to official sources, the claim that the provincial government requested to continue levying the surcharge is inaccurate. In the spring of this year, the provincial government received an order from the Executive Yuan to cease the levy and was instructed to return the collected funds to alleviate the people's hardship. Subsequently, the provincial government, considering that most counties had already remitted the collected funds to the provincial treasury, making refunds difficult, immediately reported back to the Executive Yuan for review. Therefore, the claim of a continued levy this year is not factual.</p>

<h3>Jintan Mulberry Model Area Actively Improving</h3>
<p>Qi Lun Jie and Zhu Xin Yu, the director and deputy director of the Jintan County Mulberry Improvement Model Area, are paying close attention to technical guidance. They have dispatched instructors to tour and guide farmers in various townships on silkworm rearing methods, aiming to improve practices. Farmers in the county traditionally adhere to outdated methods without considering improvements. In recent years, with the guidance of the Model Area instructors, they have gradually learned to use scientific methods for silkworm rearing. In order to implement the purpose of improvement and increase the efficiency of guidance, the director and deputy director have specially agreed with the Zhenjiang Women's Vocational School to recruit female students from Jintan to study in the sericulture department. Tuition and miscellaneous fees will be waived, and for poor students, they will also request the county government to provide meal subsidies. After graduation, they will serve exclusively in the Model Area. Furthermore, they have scheduled examinations for various subjects on the 25th and 26th of the month. The official list of successful candidates was released on the 30th, with 19 accepted candidates including Guo Jun, and 7 alternates including Wu Ruilan. It is reported that the number of female applicants reached as many as 62.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou Party Affairs Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>The Gaoyou County Party Committee members, such as Zhang Tingjie, feared that the upcoming re-election would fail. They refused to transfer the party membership of party members like Jia Yu, who had returned to Gaoyou from Shanghai. Meanwhile, they sent people to contact party members in counties such as Tianchang in Anhui Province to temporarily transfer their party membership to Gaoyou to participate in the election. Jia and others jointly filed a complaint with the provincial party headquarters, which dispatched Li Junliang to Gaoyou to thoroughly investigate and verify the facts. It is now heard that the provincial party headquarters has ordered the county party headquarters to allow party members from Gaoyou residing in Shanghai to transfer back, and to prohibit party members from Anhui from transferring to Gaoyou. It is also heard that the provincial party headquarters, in order to avoid election disputes, has appointed Zhang Gongren and Ling Shaozu, two executive committee members, to supervise the election in Gaoyou. The date of the county representative conference, originally set for September 6th, has now been changed to September 15th for the opening. It is expected that this election will not involve any further disturbances.</p>
<h3>Nantong Jiangbei Cotton Bumper Harvest</h3>
<p>The cotton in the Jiangbei area of Jiangsu Province, including Nantong, Hai'an, and the Huainan reclamation area, has grown exceptionally well this year due to improved breeding and favorable weather conditions. The harvest has already begun, and the excellent yield is unprecedented in the past 20 years. The Langshan Cotton Farm has achieved particularly good results in its cotton trials. The farm is scheduled to hold an exhibition in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Sequel to Female Student's Suicide by Jumping into the River</h3>
<p>The Da Yu steamer, traveling from Tongzhou to Shanghai, passed the Hupu Estuary when a female student, Zhang Shuzhen, jumped into the river and committed suicide. The student was a senior at the Nantong Women's Normal School. Her father passed away early, and her mother is in Fujian. She has an uncle in Shanghai. Mao Maoyou, who is allegedly involved with the female student, is the section chief of the Nantong 18th Army's wounded soldiers factory.</p>
<h3>Jiashan and Qingpu Counties Jointly Suppress Gang Bandit</h3>
<p>After the Haizhou Gang bandit Shi Tang Xiaodi was suppressed by Taibao Ashu, only the main culprit, Da Yin, remained, roaming rampant throughout Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Recently, he merged with Fang Ruihe, the leader of the Pudong Gang, further strengthening their power. They chose Dianshan Lake (the border area between Jiashan and Wujiang) as</p>
<p>a starting point for an uprising. Unexpectedly, their plan was leaked to Li Xiaotang, the second squad leader of the Qingpu Water Police, who ordered squad leaders Zhao Zhen and Wu Xionge to work with Wang Yulin, the captain of the county water patrol, to make arrangements. Fang secretly telegraphed the county government of Jiashan to prepare for a joint encirclement and suppression, aiming to eliminate them in one fell swoop and eradicate the root of the problem.</p>
<h3>Bandits Rob Seven Families in One Night</h3>
<p>With the new grain harvest approaching, banditry is rampant. The northwestern water villages of this county are no better than a land of thorns. After the four families of Gu Fulin, Gu Wenrong, and Yu Erguan, farmers in Qianjiabang, Yaozhuang Bridge, were robbed, the bandits simultaneously went to Taozhuang Village, about three miles away, and robbed three more families, including farmer Bao Changsheng. They also robbed a folk boat belonging to the Yu family near Zhangjia Bridge. County Magistrate Huang Yonglu was furious upon receiving the report and immediately ordered a strict investigation and arrest of the bandits.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan Baima Lake Fish Farming Dispute Unresolved</h3>
<p>After the fish farming dispute at Baima Lake in western Xiaoshan resulted in a tragic loss of life, the administrative part of the issue was resolved after the county government convened local agencies and legal entities to announce a solution. The judicial part of the issue was scheduled for a court hearing on September 5th and 6th, which could have brought the matter to a conclusion and awaited legal sanctions. Unexpectedly, the fish farming association re-hired a large number of thugs, intending to terrorize the fishermen. Rumors are widespread, causing panic among the fishermen along the lake. On the 31st, representatives of the fishermen requested the Public Security Bureau to provide protection to prevent a third tragedy from occurring.</p>
<h3>Hefei and Hanshan County Towns in Danger</h3>
<p>A band of bandits from Fuyang and Yingshang in northern Anhui, who are currently being suppressed by the National Army, consisting of about seven to eight hundred men, fled east into the territory of Chaoxian and Hanshan. Traces of the bandits were found not far from Hanshan County on the 28th. County Magistrate Wu Yinghan ordered the police and militia to defend the city and telegraphed the province and neighboring counties for assistance. Bandit scouts have also been discovered in places such as Zhega Xiaxia in Chaoxian County, and residents are evacuating. The troops stationed in Chaoxian and Quanjiao have dispatched teams for patrol duties.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Hurricane Ravages Shanghai</h3>
<p>Gales and Torrential Rain Halt Ship Traffic</p>
<p>Tidal Backflow Floods Streets Knee-Deep</p>
<p>Two typhoons in the East China Sea merged and moved northwards since the morning before yesterday, intensifying as they progressed. Initially, they passed through the sea areas of Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo, passing by Dachen Island and reaching outside the mouth of the Wusong River. Yesterday morning, they approached Shanghai more closely. According to the Observatory's report yesterday morning, the typhoon was about 200 miles away from Shanghai around 6:00 AM. The afternoon report at 3:00 PM indicated that the typhoon's center was about 110 miles away from Shanghai. The 9:00 PM report last night stated that the typhoon was at 122.5 degrees east longitude and 30.5 degrees north latitude, heading north-northwest, and about 60 nautical miles away from Shanghai. This indicates the fierce intensity of the storm's attack on Shanghai. Yesterday morning, the city was covered in dark clouds. Around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, gusts of wind mixed with drizzle. Around 6:00 PM in the evening, a torrential rain suddenly started, and the wind force was even stronger. By 11:00 PM, the tide in the Huangpu River surged, overflowing from the drainage ditches and flooding the streets knee-deep. The great flood of 1931 was relived last night. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Observatory Report</h3>
<p>At 4:30 PM on the 2nd, the Xujiahui Observatory reported that Shanghai had showers and strong winds of force 9 to 10 or higher, with a slight fog. The typhoon was moving northwest-north and showed signs of turning. It was approaching Shanghai gradually, and would pass the mouth of the Yangtze River at night. Both the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea had cyclones, and there were gales along the coast here. At 4:00 PM, the center of the typhoon was about 30 miles within the intersection of 30 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude, moving northwest-north, with strong winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM on the 2nd, the highest temperature in this port was 86.0 and the lowest was 77.0. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 77.0 and the lowest was 66.2.</p>
<h3>Typhoon Strikes Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, Shanghai was already affected by strong winds. However, the wind force was still small in the morning, about a force 6 northeast wind. The wind force was strongest outside the mouth of the Wusong River, from the Wenzhou ocean to the Dachen Islands off the coast of Ningbo, moving north-northwest at a high speed of 26.2 miles per hour. Therefore, it had reached Shanghai by evening. Wherever it passed, it suffered attacks and disasters. There was a heavy downpour in Shanghai in the afternoon, and the temperature dropped as a result.</p>
<h3>River Water Surges</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Huangpu River was hit by a typhoon, and the tide surged, reaching the riverbank. The small steamships in the Huangpu River stopped running early in the afternoon, and the sampans and small rowing boats all took shelter in the docks. There was no ship traffic.</p>
<h3>Tidal Backflow</h3>
<p>Since the Observatory reported yesterday morning that the typhoon would affect the local area, the news spread, and people were half-believing and half-doubting, hoping to avoid it by chance. Around 3:30 AM yesterday morning, a torrential rain suddenly fell, and then it continued incessantly without stopping. The wind gradually rose in the morning, slowly at first and then faster. It blew harder and harder in the evening, and the momentum became even more violent after 9:00 PM. The tide in the Huangpu River surged wildly, and by 10:00 PM the water had reached the land, completely submerging the Bund area. By 11:05 PM, the water had crossed Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, and Henan Road, reaching directly in front of our office entrance on Shandong Road! Vehicles could not pass east of Henan Road, and some cars stalled. As of 3:00 AM this morning, the tide on the road has not yet receded.</p>
<h3>Warning Signal Hoisted</h3>
<p>The black typhoon warning ball at the Jianghai Customs House was still hoisted on the roof of the Customs House as usual yesterday, indicating that a typhoon was coming and that shipowners should be vigilant. The offshore meteorological station also hoisted a storm warning signal, using a ball during the day and a warning light at night so that ships in the Huangpu River could see it. The Xujiahui Observatory used wireless telegraphy to transmit the direction and condition of the typhoon, as well as weather measurements, to the coastal vessels, which were very busy.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Traffic Disrupted</h3>
<p>This time, the wind hit the coasts of Wenzhou and Ningbo and the coastal ports of Zhejiang the hardest. Therefore, yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Ningbo ships, the Xin Jiangtian and Sanbei's Yixing, did not leave Ningbo for Shanghai. The ships from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Zhoushan also did not enter the port yesterday, because most of them did not set sail the night before. The Shanghai-Taiwan route ships, which were sheltering from the wind in Shanghai, continued to suspend their voyages yesterday. The maritime traffic from Shanghai to the ports on the coast of Zhejiang was completely disrupted for</p>
<p>48 hours.</p>
<h3>Ocean Liners Delayed</h3>
<p>Yesterday was a day of strong winds, and the wind force increased in the evening. Ocean liners from the north and south seas to Shanghai were blocked by the typhoon and could not reach Shanghai. Those that anchored to avoid the wind in the middle of the journey and outside Wusong included the Fairplay, Xinming, Haishang, Dalian Maru, Nagasaki Maru, Suiyang, Yisheng, Kerchus, etc., all of which sent telegrams to Shanghai, saying that they were blocked by the wind and dared not risk entering. Therefore, only a few ships from the Yangtze River, such as the Datong, Jianghua, and Meiliu, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The rest were sheltering from the wind in various places outside Wusong.</p>
<h3>Exports Halted</h3>
<p>From the afternoon before yesterday, Shanghai's seagoing ships had stopped sailing. Yesterday, the wind force was even stronger, and all the north and south sea liners that the various shipping companies should have sailed, such as the Xinning, Yisheng, Tongzhou, Fusheng, and Fusheng, announced that they would not sail. The loading and unloading of cargo at the docks also stopped because the cargo ships and barges did not sail. However, the American President McKinley and President Hoover mail ships of the Dollar Steamship Lines still sailed from Shanghai as usual. After arriving in Wusong, they would observe the wind force and then decide whether to proceed or stop. Other Blue Funnel Line and German and French cargo ships also postponed their departures. As for the Yangtze River steamers, they still sailed as usual yesterday.</p>
<h3>Mayor Concerned</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng, concerned about the typhoon passing through Shanghai, ordered all bureaus to properly plan for prevention and ordered the Public Security Bureau to pay special attention to rescue work during the typhoon's arrival. Both on land and in the river, they must step up their work. At the same time, he ordered the Municipal Public Works Bureau to send personnel to inspect the dikes within the city limits and rescue them in emergencies. The municipal government is prepared to allocate special funds at any time to expedite the handling of this matter.</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau Takes Precautions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, concerned that the hurricane in this city, with its strong winds, would affect traffic on both lines, issued a circular to all related officials and staff along both lines. All empty cars stopping at stations along both lines must be blocked with sleepers to prevent them from moving and causing danger. Any interruptions or damage to telegraph, telephone poles, and lines along the route must be reported immediately so that the Engineering Department can be notified and send workers to repair them to maintain traffic.</p>
<h3>Aviation Suspended</h3>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Hankou flight, taking off from western Shanghai, only went as far as Nanjing yesterday. The eastbound flight did not take off yesterday. The Sikorsky aircraft of the company, which was surveying the route to the Philippines, was originally scheduled to depart from the Philippines yesterday and return to Shanghai, but the company did not receive news yesterday that the aircraft had already departed, presumably due to the typhoon.</p>
<h3>Flood Prevention Damaged</h3>
<p>At 8:30 PM last night, the manager of the Dollar Steamship Lines at No. 3 Guangdong Road ordered shop clerks and others to pile sandbags around the store to prevent the river water from entering. A coppersmith named Gu Gengsheng, 26 years old, from Ningbo, was also participating in the work. Suddenly, a hurricane blew a large glass window off the wall, hitting Gu's head and causing serious injuries. Police Officer No. 2008 found him and rushed him to the Renji Hospital for treatment. His life is said to be in danger.</p>
<h3>Western Newspaper Report</h3>
<p>The China Press said that at 3:00 PM on the 2nd, the Xujiahui Observatory reported that the center of the typhoon was only 110 miles from Shanghai and was blowing towards the city. Although there was still a chance of it turning to the right and blowing into the Yellow Sea, unless an element that could change the wind direction occurred temporarily, it was feared that it would attack Shanghai with full force tonight (the 2nd) or tomorrow morning. Around 6:00 AM this morning, the typhoon was still 200 miles away, and the Shanghai area already had strong winds and showers, alternating as its prelude. At that time, the center of the typhoon was still at 27.5 degrees north latitude and 124.5 degrees east longitude, moving northwest, but very slowly, so it was difficult to determine when it would hit Shanghai. According to a report from the Dachenshan Meteorological Station at the mouth of the Yangtze River, a strong wind of force 8 had already blown through the area. According to reports, this typhoon originally had two centers, which merged near the coast of Zhejiang yesterday (the 1st), causing the wind direction to turn slightly to the right and attack Shanghai directly. Although there is currently no high pressure near Shanghai to cause it to change direction, the typhoon's movement is often elastic, and it is possible that Shanghai may be spared from being hit by its center.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Siam Telegraphically Request the Dispatch of Envoys and Consuls</h3>
<p>To Protect the Rights and Interests of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>According to news from overseas Chinese organizations in this city, there are many overseas Chinese residing in Siam. However, since the beginning of trade between China and Siam, the two sides have neither signed a commercial treaty nor mutually dispatched envoys and consuls, so when overseas Chinese in Siam encounter incidents, they have no responsible organization to negotiate on their behalf, and the suffering they endure is difficult to describe. In addition, overseas Chinese in Siam have gradually lost their nationality in fact due to the absence of a treaty. This matter is of great importance to the national prestige. It is learned that some of the overseas Chinese in Siam have recently telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, urging the government authorities to negotiate a commercial treaty with the Siamese government as soon as possible and to have both sides mutually dispatch envoys and consuls to be stationed in various places to handle the affairs of overseas Chinese and protect their rights and interests.</p>

<h3>Russian Merchants Association Hosted Reporters Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Solemnly Declaring No Political Role</p>
<p>Publishing Opinions on Sino-Russian Trade</p>
<p>Due to reports that the Russian Merchants Association in this city has a political role and various conspiracies, fearing that people from all circles do not understand the truth, causing misunderstandings, the association specially hosted the news media at the Du Cheng Restaurant on Sima Road yesterday afternoon. About 30 Chinese and foreign reporters attended, and the association's main member, Mikhailov, and the Soviet TASS news agency reporter Ernev, etc., treated them cordially. During the meeting, Mikhailov reported the truth of the matter and issued a written statement on his opinions on Sino-Russian trade. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Hongkou as Usual</h3>
<p>In the Hongkou district, along Tiantong Road and the Xiangyan Bridge area, including the Sheng, Zhengda, Yuncheng, and Yichang branch factories, as well as various silk factories such as Yichang Chang, Changfeng, Zhen, Jiufeng, Yifeng, Sheng Zhengda, and Xiang Sheng, workers did not participate in the strike because the piece-rate system was not adopted. All factories started work as usual yesterday. The labor union advised:</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Yuan Yunlong, Liu Sanbao, Wu Suzhen, Wang Qiaoyun, and other directors and supervisors, as well as staff members of the entire Sixth District Silk Industry Labor Union, set out to advise workers to resume work first and wait for the labor union to report to the Party and government authorities for legal handling. However, the female workers insisted that the capitalists' change to the piece-rate system was actually a disguised reduction in wages and a clear violation of the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation, so they decided to persist and refused to resume work. Furthermore, due to the commotion caused by the female workers, the order in factories like Wuxing had been disrupted, and fearing accidents, work was also suspended immediately.</p>
<p>Appeal to the Party and government:</p>
<p>The Sixth District Silk Industry Labor Union prepared and submitted a petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, dispatching Li Tonggai. Fan Guoren, a staff member of the Civil Training Section, received the petition and promised to handle it together with the Social Affairs Bureau. He Yin was dispatched to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, and Wang Xianqing, the director of the Mediation Section, received him and promised that personnel had already been dispatched for investigation, and would be handled according to law after the report. The text of the petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>The petition requests that the silk factory trade association be ordered to temporarily suspend the implementation of the piece-rate system, and that the striking factories be ordered to start work immediately to avoid the expansion of the labor unrest.</p>
<p>During the period when the change to the piece-rate system was made, it had been reported on file, causing a reaction from the workers, which led to the strikes at factories such as Chang'an Road, Tai Factory, and Zhenxing Jiyu Chuxin yesterday afternoon, which then spread to other factories. It was found that the capitalists did not notify the affiliated association of the detailed methods before changing the piece-rate system this time, and suddenly announced its implementation from September 1, which led to the workers' fierce opposition and the outbreak of the labor unrest. The capitalists are, of course, difficult to absolve of blame. Moreover, the piece-rate system currently implemented by the capitalists is definitely a disguised form of wage reduction, using the improvement of products as a slogan to satisfy their desires, and a disguised overthrow of the July 8 mediation decision, which is very obvious. If this is not resolved for a long time, it will inevitably cause a labor unrest in the silk factories throughout the entire district. Who will be responsible? Therefore, a special petition is submitted to your bureau requesting that the silk factory trade association be ordered to temporarily suspend implementation before obtaining the consent of the workers, maintain the original contract, immediately start the cars and resume work in the factories where labor unrest has occurred to avoid the expansion of the labor unrest, which is really in the public interest.</p>
<p>Factory Meetings</p>
<p>After the female workers' strike, various silk factories in the Zhabei District gathered for discussion at the Zhabei Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from each factory attended. After a long discussion, it was resolved that the piece-rate system would be changed. Because it has already been implemented in Nanshi and Wuxi, it is believed that it can improve the silk produced by the factories and has no impact on the livelihoods of the workers. It was decided not to stop the process due to the workers' opposition, and a report was submitted to the trade association for review and handling. Before the workers agree to the change, work will be temporarily suspended. After the meeting, the details were reported to Shen Huachen, the chairman of the trade association, to discuss solutions. The principle was approved.</p>
<p>The Sixth District Silk Industry Labor Union told reporters from Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday that the change to the piece-rate system by the various silk factories was not explained to the workers in advance, nor was there any preparation. Only a letter was sent to the labor union on August 30 explaining that it would be implemented on September 1. Moreover, there is no genuine piece-rate system; it is actually a disguised reduction in wages. As for the principles of the piece-rate system, the labor union and the workers all agree with it. The labor union is very willing to form a piece-rate system research committee with the trade association to conduct joint research. After a concrete plan is decided, it will be explained to the workers and implemented. The factories declared its implementation in a hurry, which led to the workers' opposition and strike, and the capitalists should be fully responsible. The factories north of the railway and in the Hongkou concession have agreed to temporarily suspend implementation, so the workers are all working as usual.</p>
<p>Trade Association Advice</p>
<p>The silk factory trade association told reporters from Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday that the futures thrown out to foreign merchants by the factories are always subject to various nitpicking by foreign merchants because the goods do not meet the requirements, resulting in losses. In order to improve products and compete with foreign silk, the piece-rate system is changed by imitating the methods of Wuxi Nanshi. After implementation, it will have no impact on the livelihoods of the workers. It is regrettable that the workers have been incited by unscrupulous elements, causing misunderstandings and strikes. In addition to reporting to the competent authorities and waiting for solutions, the trade association intends to advise the striking factories to endure the pain and start work first, hoping that the workers will enter the factories and resume work, but will never stop the implementation of the piece-rate system due to the workers' opposition. However, the fourth day is the fifteenth day of the lunar seventh month, when workers traditionally stop working, so the date of resumption of work will be from the fifth day.</p>
<p>Government Handling</p>
<p>In response to the opposition to the piece-rate system and the strikes by the female workers in the Zhabei District silk factories, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in addition to dispatching personnel to investigate the truth, believes that the factory's implementation is inevitably rushed in terms of timing. It is said that a handling plan has been drafted: first, advise the factories to start work, and the workers to resume work first, and then discuss the change to the piece-rate system, with both labor and capital willing, to ensure that it does not affect the livelihoods of the workers and strive to improve the products of the factories, to show fairness.</p>
<p>Yesterday's News on British and American Labor Unrest</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Does Not Allow Workers to Organize a Strike Committee</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Approves Measures to Be Followed by the Bureau</p>
<p>The Mediation of the Children's School Case Failed Again Yesterday</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the labor dispute involving the slowdown strike by workers at British and American tobacco factories has not yet been resolved. Regarding the children's school issue, the mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau failed yesterday. The bureau has approved the labor union's request to organize a strike committee for the record, and Mayor Wu Tiecheng has personally drafted solutions for each case to be implemented by both parties through the Social Affairs Bureau. The dispute is expected to end. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>No Strike Allowed</p>
<p>After the second representatives' meeting of the Fifth District Tobacco Industry Labor Union on the 28th of last month, it was decided to set up a strike committee to promote the factory's awareness. However, the factory still ignored it. Therefore, it submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau for the record the day before yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau stated that the labor dispute cases of the factory have been approved by the Municipal Government to determine the solution and forwarded for compliance. Therefore, the bureau refused to approve the labor union's request for the record.</p>
<p>Still Slowing Down</p>
<p>After the workers of the British and American New and Old Factories began slowing down work on the 25th of last month, the factory ignored it, resulting in no resolution. After the printing workers of the new factory started their cars the day before yesterday, which almost caused a disaster, the factory stopped work yesterday morning. The remaining workers continued to enter the factory and slow down work as usual, with good order, because there was no solution.</p>
<p>Mediation Failed</p>
<p>Because of the issue of the children's school for British and American workers, the Social Affairs Bureau has repeatedly convened mediation, but the opinions of both parties have not been close, resulting in the case being suspended for four months and still difficult to resolve. Therefore, a mediation meeting was convened at the Social Affairs Bureau at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. The labor union representatives Chen Peide, Lou Jingguan, Zhang Ziping, and Bao Yangyin attended. However, the capitalists' representatives did not attend, so the method of proceeding was discussed. Wang Gang, a staff member of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, inquired about the opinions of the labor union representatives so that the next mediation could be implemented, and it was scheduled to be held again the day after tomorrow (Tuesday).</p>
<p>Labor Union Notice</p>
<p>The Fifth District Tobacco Labor Union notified all workers yesterday morning, saying: "Regarding urgent notification, according to reports from workers, the factory is using stooges to spread rumors in an attempt to undermine unity and cause conflicts, which is really frightening. In addition to reporting to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau for investigation, a special notification is issued to all workers that no resumption of work is allowed without a formal order from the Party and government authorities and a formal notification from the labor union, so as to show caution. This is very important."</p>
<p>Representatives' Meeting</p>
<p>After the representatives' meeting of the Fifth District Tobacco Labor Union decided on the 28th of last month to set up a strike committee to seek a final resolution, it has been decided to hold an emergency representatives' meeting at the Pudong meeting place at 5:30 PM on the 4th of this month to discuss the process. A document was submitted to the Party and government authorities, saying: "Regarding the submission of a request, the association's representatives' meeting on August 28 resolved to organize a strike committee to promote the factory's awareness. However, the capitalists still ignored it. It has been decided to hold an emergency representatives' meeting at 5:30 PM on the 4th of this month to discuss the process. It is appropriate to submit a request to your association and bureau to send representatives to attend and supervise the meeting at that time, which is really virtuous and convenient."</p>
<p>Scheduled Arbitration</p>
<p>Regarding the non-payment of two days' wages for the shutdown of British and American tobacco factories, after the labor union submitted a request to the Municipal Government for arbitration, the Municipal Government has scheduled a meeting at 2:00 PM on the 5th of this month to convene both parties for arbitration, and notices have been issued. However, the Municipal Government has drafted a plan for this case, and it should be resolved at that time.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Instruction</p>
<p>The Municipal Government, in view of the fact that the British and American cases have been suspended for a long time and are difficult to resolve, fearing that they will expand, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun has drafted a draft plan, which has been personally revised by the mayor and instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to order both parties to implement. The original order is recorded below:</p>
<p>"For the sake of compliance with the order, the Municipal Government's Instruction No. 6778 states: For the sake of issuing orders, the British American Tobacco Company has recently had repeated labor disputes. The bureau has requested instructions from the government on the following cases: (1) The case of firing three child laborers; (2) The case of requesting amendments to factory rules; (3) The case of improving the organization of the children's school for workers; (4) The case of wages for slowdown due to factory wage reduction; (5) The case of firing worker No. 146 in the old factory's leaf workshop; (6) The case of firing worker No. 938 in the new factory's long workshop; (7) The case of wages for this slowdown. The first and third cases listed above have been approved and instructed for notification. The second case has been sent separately to solicit the opinions of labor and capital for compilation and handling. The fourth case has been submitted for extension of judgment. The cases that need to be resolved urgently are the fifth, sixth, and seventh cases. Regarding the fifth case, after reviewing the entire file and convening the parties concerned for questioning, the results of the study are considered that the factory's handling of the case is inappropriate. The only reason for the dismissal of worker No. 146 is assaulting the staff member Ren Wenzhong. The evidence held, except for anonymous letters, is the report of the staff member of the old factory. However, this report only mentions 'all staff members'. There is no one who has signed their name, and no one who has witnessed the worker committing the crime. It is impossible to consider it confirmed. The report submitted by the factory to the government only mentions 'Recently, I have inquired in many ways, and according to some male and female workers, I have indeed beaten them.' It can be seen that the worker No. 146 committed the crime. There is no confirmation. The factory trusts the staff's one-sided words, does not investigate.</p>
<p>They will be fired by Erjiang. It should be ordered to reinstate it to show justice. Since the dismissal of worker No. 146 is considered inappropriate, the wage issue for the seventh case slowdown is easy to resolve. In short, this case was caused by the factory dismissing workers for no reason, arousing the public anger of the workers, and in terms of reasoning, the responsibility should be borne by the capital. However, the bureau notified both parties on the 8th to convene mediation, and the workers started a slowdown at 7:00 AM on the 9th. According to the law, it is also inappropriate. Since the workers submitted a statement to the government, they have been ordered by the government to handle the outstanding cases separately. They should wait for mediation. The workers even announced a slowdown, including the new factory part, at the time of mediation, which is even more inappropriate. Considering that the case was caused by the factory dismissing worker No. 146 for no reason, the factory should be immediately ordered to pay 70% of the slowdown wages for the old factory's leaf workshop, and the full amount of wages for other parts of the old factory, and half of the wages for the new factory, (that is, half of the wages for the slowdown period after the 25th of this month). Regarding the sixth case, it was found that the dismissal of worker No. 938 was not only for the trivial matter of going out to buy snacks, but also because he repeatedly violated the factory rules, disobeyed orders, and was not subject to management, resulting in three major offenses. The dismissal of him is detailed in the worker's usual behavior and various reports. There is no doubt that he is to blame for it. The bureau's original punishment in this case should be revoked immediately, and the factory should be allowed to dismiss worker No. 938 to warn others. You must forward it separately and follow it, and report the situation of compliance for review. This order, etc., for this reason, in addition to the sub-order, it is urgent to order you to comply with it, and you must report the situation of compliance for review. This order, the Shandong fellow villagers association in Beijing telegraphed to quickly raise huge sums of money to release emergency relief.</p>
<p>Disaster victims boarded on trees waiting to be fed.</p>
<p>The old and the weak rolled over in the ditches and were reduced to death.</p>
<p>The Xinhe Relief Society received a telegram from the Shandong Fellow Villagers Association in the capital yesterday, saying that the southwest of Shandong Province was hit by floods and that houses were gone. Please quickly raise huge sums of money for emergency relief. The original telegram is as follows: "Xinwei Relief Society, the Yellow River has overflowed this time, causing a huge disaster in the four provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu. The southwest of Shandong, including more than ten counties such as Heze, Juye, Fanpu, Yuncheng, Dongping, and Shou Zhang, have been particularly affected. The floods have washed away houses. The disaster victims are climbing on roofs and trees waiting to be fed. The old and the weak are rolling over in the ditches and being reduced to death. They want to call Jiang Bo, relatives and friends hugging the same sick, begging from door to door. There is no family in the neighborhood to start a fire. The association's home is concerned, and the pain is deep. Aiding the drowning is lacking in skills, and the heart is more worried. We have always admired your association's aim of giving generously to help the public, and dare to move the mutual assistance. If you are favored with benevolence, please give generously to the disaster victims, and the cup is given to continue their lives. Thank you for your great kindness, not only our association. The telegram is rushing, and I cannot bear the expectation. Shandong Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing, Ding Weifen, Wang Zizhuang, Gao Bingfang, Cui Weiwu, Song Hanwen, Zhang Pinqing, and others, respectfully."</p>

<p>Authorities in the Chinese-administered area of Shanghai are paying attention to the order of the Gold Exchange Market</p>
<p>Han Donghui died after being bumped in the market</p>
<p>Han Donghui, a native of Yuyao, Zhejiang, was a broker who also interacted with the Gold Exchange for buying and selling. On the morning of last Tuesday, while trading at the Exchange, he was suddenly knocked down by a shop assistant of a gold store in the market, losing consciousness. He was sent to Renji Hospital by the Exchange's vehicle, but died despite efforts to save him (commonly known as stroke). According to the deceased's family, although Mr. Han's death was caused by being knocked down and losing breath, the real cause of his death was the lack of order in the Gold Exchange Market. It is found that the Exchange is crowded with people and disorderly during both the morning and afternoon trading sessions. In addition, the market facilities are imperfect, so there is no attention paid to public safety, sanitation, etc., resulting in this fatal accident. It is hoped that the municipal government and the concession's Public Works Department will pay special attention to this issue, and ensure that the Exchange thoroughly improves all facilities and strictly regulates the market order, so as to avoid the recurrence of unfortunate incidents.</p>

In addition to office buildings, there are also two canteens, a billiard room, a gymnasium, a garage, and stables. The garage can accommodate 50 cars, and all other new-style facilities are equipped. According to Foley, the person in charge of the police station, the police station is even larger than the Berlin Police Station and may be considered one of the world's largest police stations.</p>
<p>Citizens petition for the construction of a large park</p>
<p>The municipal government forwards the order to the Public Works Bureau to actively plan</p>
<p>The city has always lacked parks. Although there is now the Confucius Temple Park, it is still considered too small. Therefore, citizens such as Li Zhujun have initiated the construction of a large park in Shanghai, and have submitted an outline and budget to the central government, which has sent personnel to Shanghai to plan and ordered the Shanghai political and business circles to jointly organize a preparatory committee to actively handle the matter. The municipal government has reportedly received the instruction and immediately forwarded the order to the Public Works Bureau to actively plan.</p>
<p>Absurd and outrageous postman</p>
<p>Greedy and lazy, not delivering newspapers and magazines</p>
<p>Giving them away or selling them all</p>
<p>On the 24th of last month, the French Public Works Department handed over hundreds of copies of French newspapers (a bundle weighing 18 pounds) to the post office for delivery to foreign merchants in the city. After being stamped by the department, they were handed over to Yu Dongsheng (22 years old, native of Wuxi), the postman No. 349 on Route 5 of the Xiafei Road branch, for delivery. However, Yu was greedy and lazy, thinking that these official newspapers were not important, so he did not bother to deliver them, and gave them all to Xu Xirui, a servant of a Westerner at No. 142 at the intersection of Geluo Hill Road and Shanzhong Road. Xu sold the newspapers to Gu Huier, a Jiangbei boy who collected old goods, for 1,000 wen, and actually received 950 wen. Then Gu resold them to a sesame cake stall on Gubali Road in the French Concession for 2,000 wen. On the afternoon of the 31st, at 5:00 PM, Inspector No. 49 of the post office encountered a large bundle of official newspapers on Gubali Road, stamped with the August 24 postmark. He inquired about the origin, and reported to the bureau. The director of the bureau reported to the police station, which sent detective Liu Fushan to arrest the postman Yu Dongsheng, the servant Xu Xirui, and the old-goods collector Gu Huier, and retrieve the official newspapers, bringing them to the police station. Yesterday, they were handed over to the Criminal Court No. 1 of the Second Special District Court. Fei Xizhen, the police station's lawyer, explained the case, and prosecuted the defendants for obstructing official duties under Articles 144 and 138 of the Criminal Law, and presented the official newspapers to the court. Yu Dongsheng confessed that he had been a mailman in the post office since he was 19 years old, and had been there for three years. He said that Xu asked him for the official newspapers, and he was confused for a while and gave them to him out of greed and laziness. Xu and Gu both admitted to the sale and purchase. Gu Jirong, the lawyer hired by Yu, made a brief defense and requested that Yu be allowed to post bail. Judge Zhang Chaozuo verified the confession, declared the debate concluded, and scheduled a judgment in seven days. Yu Dongsheng was allowed to post bail for appearance on call, and Xu and Gu were remanded in custody pending instructions.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation's Telecommunications Factory Closed Down the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Completed Receiving at 9:00 PM Late at Night</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation's Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Factory closed down yesterday after being ordered to shut down. The Ministry of Transportation sent personnel to take charge of the factory. Employees were given severance pay, and all materials were received by the receiving personnel sent by the Ministry of Transportation the day before yesterday. The factory gate was locked. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Late Night Reception</p>
<p>After the factory was ordered to shut down, the Ministry of Transportation sent technicians Zhang Hongtu and clerk Zhang Xisheng to Shanghai to take over. After arriving in Shanghai, Zhang and others went to the factory across the Huangpu River with the factory director Yu Ruxin at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday to engage in receiving. When receiving, the Third District Bureau of Public Security ordered the branch office to send ten armed police to the scene to maintain order and send personnel to take charge.</p>
<p>Personnel Taking Charge</p>
<p>In addition to sending Zhang and others as receiving personnel, the Ministry of Transportation also added Shi Yingxiang, a technician from the factory, as a custodian. When receiving, Zhang et al., Factory Director Yu, and Custodian Shi jointly received each part one by one. After checking that there were no errors in the receiving register, they sealed the doors of each part of the house and stamped the private seals of the two receiving staff and Factory Director Yu and Custodian Shi to show prudence. At the same time, the custodian ordered all personnel in the factory to leave the factory before 8:00 PM. From then on, no one was allowed to enter the factory without an exit pass. It was not until 9:30 PM at night that the processing was completed, and the factory gate was closed, leaving only the small door next to it for the personnel remaining in the factory to enter and exit.</p>
<p>Personnel Remaining in the Factory</p>
<p>The factory still has a lot of materials, stationery, etc. After being approved by the custodian, the Ministry of Transportation retained a small number of responsible persons among the staff of each department to take care of the factory. These personnel were retained from among the old personnel who had served in the factory for many years and had been diligent in their service, including Wu Jiying and others. They were responsible for taking care of the furniture, documents, and various materials stored in the factory. In addition, two servants and one gatekeeper were retained. All of the above-mentioned personnel remaining in the factory will still receive their original salaries during the custody period and be paid severance pay.</p>
<p>Severance Pay</p>
<p>After the receiving was completed, a notice was issued, roughly saying that the factory was ordered to close down today. All employees will be paid one month's severance pay. They are expected to claim it from today until September 10 at the Wireless Radio Shanghai Joint Office of the Ministry of Transportation, Lao Beimen, Min'guo Road. It is said that the workers are temporarily unwilling to claim one month's severance pay and have decided to petition for an appropriate increase.</p>
<p>Municipal Health Laboratory Tests for Syphilis Serology</p>
<p>Syphilis is the most serious disease, and special attention should be paid to hiring wet nurses. If you want to know whether you are infected with the disease and whether the toxins have been eliminated after treatment, you must check the serology. The Shanghai Municipal Health Laboratory now has an increasing number of people requesting syphilis testing, so a special serology testing room has been set up to test every patient's serology daily. Two methods of Watts and one method of Camp are used for testing to ensure proper treatment. The testing method is extremely precise, and the fee is only two yuan. If doctors need to perform syphilis serology tests on patients or wet nurses, they can send the serology to the Health Laboratory at Guangdong Street, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, Shanghai, to request testing. The laboratory can also collect blood on its behalf without additional charge, which is really convenient for doctors and patients.</p>
<p>British New Warship Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The British Yangtze River gunboat Sunpiper, assembled by the Jiangnan Shipyard, was completed at the end of last month. All long- and short-wave radios were installed the day before yesterday and inspected by the British naval commander stationed in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, personnel from the shipyard handed over the warship to Captain Ayre for inspection. It was not completed until the afternoon. The warship immediately hoisted the English flag. The receiving personnel and the handing-over personnel drank champagne together to celebrate. It is said that the warship is scheduled to make its maiden voyage to Beijing within one or two days, and then go to Wuhan.</p>
<p>Qing Municipal Government and Others Request Maintenance of the Shanghai-Qingdao Route of the Puan Ship</p>
<p>To Avoid the Shipping Industry Falling into the Hands of the Japanese</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is in contact with the Navy Department</p>
<p>The Puan ship, jointly operated by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Navy Department, operates between Putuo and Qingdao for a period of three months. The term has now expired. The Bureau has successively received telegrams from the Qingdao Municipal Government, Chamber of Commerce, and Jiaoji Railway Authority, saying that the Shanghai-Qingdao route has always been monopolized by the Japanese. Among the Chinese ships, the Puan ship is the only one with comfortable mid-class cabins and stable speed. Therefore, since the ship started operating, Chinese merchants and passengers have abandoned Japanese ships and flocked to Chinese ships, recovering many rights and interests. If the Puan ship stops operating, the shipping industry on the route will fall into the hands of the Japanese again. Therefore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is requested to maintain the Shanghai-Qingdao route of the Puan ship. Since the ship is jointly operated with the Navy Department, the Bureau is currently contacting the Navy Department.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Deyu's New Honor</p>
<p>Passed the Life Insurance Salesman Specialist Examination in Previous Years</p>
<p>Now Passed the Life Insurance Sales Management Specialist Examination Again</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Deyu is a Master of Business Administration from Benshemin University in the United States and specializes in all subjects of life insurance. After returning to China, he served as a specialist calculator in the China Anhe Joint Insurance Company. He has been an inspector in the company's management department for many years. However, Mr. Zhang has been diligent, promoting business on the one hand, and still studying diligently and seeking further education on the other. The director of the American Life Insurance Sales Specialist University is Dr. Xubena, a scholar of the life insurance industry who came to China a few years ago and is globally respected. In the previous year, St. John's University President Bokfangji was entrusted to administer the Life Insurance Salesman Specialist examination. Mr. Zhang passed the examination and obtained a diploma, making him the only specialist in this field in China today. This summer in June, the university asked President Bok to administer the Life Insurance Sales Management Specialist examination again. This subject is even more advanced. Those who do not hold a diploma in Sales Specialist are not allowed to take the examination. Mr. Zhang also passed the examination. He received a letter from Dr. Xubena yesterday, saying that the diploma will be sent soon, and congratulated Mr. Zhang on receiving this new honor, becoming the first person in China to obtain this diploma.</p>
<p>Monthly Deposits from Two Roads to Repay Debts</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Line Can Be Repaid in Three Years</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have been actively reorganized, saving waste and increasing revenue, considerable results have been achieved. Currently, the two lines make monthly deposits to repay loans. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Line can be repaid in three years. The Shanghai-Nanjing Line has more debts and will take longer to repay. However, stock prices have risen since the last payment.</p>
<p>Two Letters from the Local Maintenance Association</p>
<p>Reply to the Investigation Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles Investigation Committee for National Salvation Donations has sent letters to various groups that collected national salvation donations, requesting account books and receipts. The former Shanghai Citizens Local Maintenance Association sent a letter in reply to the Committee, specifying a period for personnel to be sent to check. The Committee continued to send letters requesting that the account books and receipts be sent to the Committee. It is now heard that the Maintenance Association sent a letter to the Committee yesterday, saying, "Having received your grand letter of August 30, (central route) and having found your reply of August 20, your committee is scheduled to send personnel to our association for verification from August 28 to the 4th of next month, every afternoon from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. We have been waiting for your committee's special envoy for a week. If we are said to refuse investigation, that is a misunderstanding. The reason why we advocate prudence is that we do not know who is the responsible main group of your committee. Now that we have continued to receive instructions that the committee is jointly formed by fifteen legal entities, with the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce listed first, and your committee is located in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, we have jointly decided to send all account books and receipts for the national salvation donations and relief group donations handled by our association to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce for careful receipt and counting. When checking, the original handlers of our association and the two accountants Xu Yongzuo and Pan Xulun who were originally responsible for checking will be notified in advance to jointly check. In addition to sending a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, we are also replying for your reference." (omitted below)</p>
<p>The letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce reads: " (omitted above) Our former association received a letter from the Shanghai All-Circles Investigation Committee for National Salvation Donations, saying that the account books and receipts of the national salvation donations handled by our former association should be sent for investigation, etc. We have opened and listed the dates and times and replied, requesting the committee to send responsible personnel to our association for investigation, but we have not seen any personnel sent to our association. It has now been found that the committee is jointly formed by fifteen legal entities, and your association is one of the fifteen legal entities of the committee, and the committee is located in your association's location. As a result of a group discussion, for the sake of caution, we advocate sending all account books and receipts for the national salvation donations and relief group donations handled by our former association to your association. We would like to ask you to specify a date, and our former association will send personnel to request receipt and counting. When checking, the original handlers of our former association and the two accountants Xu Yongzuo and Pan Xulun who were originally responsible for handling the verification will be notified in advance to jointly check. All the details will be publicly assigned by our former association's two vice presidents Wang Xiaolai and Du Yuesheng to represent the negotiation.

<p>Zhonghua Bookstore's Latest Invention of Dual-Purpose Wax Paper</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry Grants a Ten-Year Patent</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Feikui of Zhonghua Bookstore invented dual-purpose wax paper, which is convenient for copying and has been praised for a long time. The Ministry of Industry has now recognized that this type of wax paper meets the needs of the Chinese people and has granted a ten-year patent. It is said that ordinary steel pen wax paper on the market is only suitable for handwriting. If a typewriter is used to type a manuscript, it is impossible. The dual-purpose wax paper invented by the bookstore is dry in nature, and does not change with temperature. Whether it is a Chinese or Western typewriter manuscript, it can be handled easily. If you want to write with a steel pen, it is even more fluent and free. If you want to write larger fonts or draw books, you can use a slightly harder pencil. You only need to line it with silk board underneath, and the strokes of the characters are as straight as those written by a writing brush, which is beautiful and lovely. It is said that each box of this type of wax paper contains twenty sheets. During the bookstore's low-price period, until September 10, the third size sells for only two yuan, three jiao, four fen per box, and the fourth size sells for only three yuan, one jiao, four fen per box.</p>
<p>Tang Wenzhong Extorts Money Due to a Love Triangle, and Is Found to Have Committed a Heinous Crime of Assault with an Axe</p>
<p>Tang Wenzhong, also known as Tang Laosi, from Zhenjiang, was originally a loafer who specialized in extorting money from good and weak people. Last month, he got into a love triangle with Ding Xiaomao over a prostitute. He forcibly demanded fifty yuan from Ding at the Huaqingchi Bathhouse on Hankou Road. Ding was unwilling to yield, and Tang threatened him greatly, which aroused the injustice of Lu Qingfu, a bystander, who reported to the Laoza Gate Police Station. Detective Yang Dechun arrested Tang and handed him over to the First Special District Local Court, ordering him to be detained for investigation and interrogation. Now, Detective Yang has learned that Tang also committed an assault with an axe in the Wenquan Bathhouse on Aiduya Road on the night of May 26 last year. Zhao Fukun had recommended his friend Wang to work as a foot masseur on the upper floor of the Wenquan Bathhouse. There was also a foot masseur with the surname Wang on the lower floor of the bathhouse. He often went to the upper floor to solicit business. The Wang on the upper floor believed that the Wang on the lower floor</p>

<p>Education News Highlights</p>
<p>Jiangsu Education Fund Situation: Accumulated Debt, Increased Budget, Difficult to Balance Income and Expenditure; Education Fund Management Office Negotiates with the Education Department for Relief</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Funding Budget for the 20th year of the Republic [1931], as resolved by the Finance Committee, remains at 4.3 million yuan, in accordance with the 21st year [1932]. The Jiangsu provincial authorities have notified the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office of the Finance Committee's resolution. However, it is reported that the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office faces substantial accumulated debt, exceeding one million yuan. Although the budget for the 21st year lists 4.3 million yuan, including 300,000 yuan in subsidies from the Finance Department and 200,000 yuan in administrative income from various schools, the actual expenditure is approximately 3.8 million yuan. Among this 3.8 million yuan, over 400,000 yuan is allocated for repaying old debts. Therefore, the actual expenditure for regular and temporary budgets is only a little over three million yuan. The Finance Department's subsidy of 300,000 yuan for this year has not been received (the so-called subsidy of 300,000 yuan in the 21st year was never received, amounting to a fictitious income and actual expenditure). Furthermore, the repayment of old debts is not included in the budget (over 800,000 yuan remains unpaid). As of September, only the June expenses for provincial schools have been disbursed, with a two-month gap, resulting in a deficit of approximately 500,000 yuan (approximately the sum of 247,000 yuan per month for two months). The bank has not been repaid 220,000 yuan in loans, in addition to tens of thousands of yuan for overseas study expenses and various temporary expenses. These tens of thousands of yuan are all due to accumulated deficits from the 21st-year education funding. Based on education fund income, land tax is around 2.5 million yuan, and slaughter and tooth taxes are around 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan, totaling approximately 3.8 million yuan. Given the accumulated deficits, increasing the budget will inevitably make it difficult to balance income and expenditure. It is reported that the Education Fund Management Office has been negotiating with the provincial authorities for relief measures, requesting a reconsideration. However, the official budget has not yet been communicated to the office by the provincial authorities.</p>

He stated that the association had already accomplished some of the things that everyone hoped for, and some things had not yet been accomplished.

<p>Closing Declaration of the Conference</p>
<p>The Chinese Library Association held its Second Annual Conference in Peiping on August 28, 1933, and concluded after four days. Library representatives from all over the country, regardless of distance, came together to present and discuss, in order to jointly promote the progress of the national library cause. After the opening ceremony, several meetings were held. Colleagues frankly shared their views and passed more than fifty proposals, all of which had an impact on the future development of the cause. Although due to various duties, there was not enough time for further discussion, the achievements of this conference are enough to be gratifying. At the beginning of the annual conference, the association had already announced two meanings as a declaration. Now that the conference is closing, we will reflect on ourselves and are willing to continue to express our feelings, both to encourage ourselves and to seek advice from people in the country. In recent years, the progress of the Chinese library cause has been a significant fact, but colleagues have never failed to realize that their responsibilities are heavy and the road is long, and there are many things that need to be worked on in the future. Before this annual conference, based on practical investigation, ensuring the stability and independence of library funding and promoting the use of libraries for the majority of the public should be the two key points for future efforts. Therefore, during the conference, there were detailed discussions on this topic, such as formulating the ratio of funding for each library and its guarantee, requesting the government to allocate funds to expand the library cause, the separate establishment and cooperation of libraries and public education centers, and the methods of promoting reading among the public, all of which will seek to achieve them with the strength of the libraries themselves and the support of the authorities. However, the hopes and goals of the colleagues for future efforts are even greater than this. In summary, there are about two points: First, to improve the efficiency of libraries. In modern times, various facilities for collection, cataloging, storage, and reading of libraries are changing day by day. Although our country has also been catching up rapidly, there are unlimited areas that need to be improved. Because libraries should be widely established, but it is even more important to promote their application. The circulation of books is more important than the increase in books. Based on this meaning, within the limits of manpower and economic possibilities, how to carefully select and purchase, improve cataloging, and even how to attract readers, guide reading, in order to substantially increase their efficiency and functions, and to help the public increase their knowledge, are all things that we should carefully consider and strive to implement. Libraries must penetrate into the people and provide services, and then society will naturally be happy to receive their help and give them importance. Second, to improve China's academic culture. The early development of Chinese culture and its rich content are known to the Chinese people, and people all over the world also recognize it. Today, the books stored in libraries are based on paper and printing technology, both of which were created by our ancestors. The invention of paper was thousands of years before Westerners used it, and printing technology was also five hundred years earlier than in Europe. But to this day, Western printing technology is becoming more refined, books are becoming richer, education is becoming more popular, and various academic fields are constantly advancing. In our country, education is biased, academic fields are lagging behind, so that there are very few contributions from Chinese people to the world's academic culture. The inequality of China's international political status is deeply shameful to us, and the inequality of academic fields cannot be ignored. The loss of land is a great catastrophe for China, and the moral decay of academic culture is a great shame for our nation. From now on, how to popularize national education and improve specialized research is the responsibility of educators and government authorities across the country. Libraries, as the center for providing research materials, have a noble mission. Now that schools are becoming more popular, libraries should support each other. In recent years, various academic societies have been working hard to promote academic research, and libraries should be the general hub to assist all research. We must work together to promote intellectual development and academic prosperity so that China can advance side by side with the major countries of the world in terms of culture, and then our library colleagues can be worthy of their responsibilities. For all of the above, colleagues of the Chinese Library Association are willing to devote themselves to the national libraries to go, but their abilities are limited, and they are deeply afraid of not being able to bear the burden. They cannot but sincerely ask the government and all sectors of society to give them sympathy, guidance, and assistance, such as raising the status of libraries and increasing the protection of their funding, which cannot be achieved without the leadership of the wise authorities. The public's willingness to read and make progress depends on the joint promotion of society. All facilities of libraries are also expected to be guided and assisted by all sectors of society. Gentlemen, seeing this sincerity and giving supervision and education will not only make libraries prosper, but also bring boundless good to China's future.</p>
<p>Visiting Two Exhibitions</p>
<p>All members boarded cars at 7:00 AM on the 31st and went to the Peiping Library to visit the Song, Yuan, and Ming Rare Book Exhibition and the German Modern Printing Exhibition, and to visit the various reading rooms of the Peiping Library. After members from various provinces and cities entered, Yuan Tongli, deputy director of the Peiping Library, and members of the reception group guided the visit to the two exhibitions and explained everything.</p>

After tea and snacks, the Association members were led by various receptionists to visit the various palaces. The members from various provinces and cities who had never visited the Palace Museum before were filled with emotion at the unreasonable imperial autocracy. Although there were various antiquities, they were all taken from the people's fat and blood. There were four cabinets of palace books, from the first cabinet to the fourth cabinet. The fifth and sixth cabinets were presented manuscripts, and the seventh and eighth cabinets were finely copied books. The ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth cabinets were Buddhist scriptures, and the fifteenth and sixteenth cabinets were Manchu and Mongolian palace books. The above are the ancient books displayed in Qianqing Palace. The Complete Library of the Four Treasuries of Wenyuan Pavilion has been moved south, but the buildings are still magnificent and can represent the oldest library in China. After the members finished the visit, they were sent by the Palace Museum receptionists to Tiananmen Square. At 12:05 PM, the members boarded the Tsinghua University bus to the Pinghan Railway Hotel.</p>

In the midst of the festivities, Tian Hongdu, the representative of the Peiping Library Association, delivered a speech, briefly stating that on behalf of the Association, he welcomed members from various provinces and cities and expressed his apologies for the inadequate hospitality. He asked everyone to forgive him. In addition to obtaining good results, the organization of public education can be more strict in the future. Success or failure is a matter of the entire group. The annual meeting of the Library Association is to connect provincial and municipal associations, libraries, and librarians, and to study the improvement of library services in order to seek common and balanced development. The meeting ended happily at 1:30 PM. After the banquet, members from various provinces and cities went to the Three Great Halls, the Relics Exhibition Hall, and other places for sightseeing.</p>

<p>Members of the China Economic Society Disperse at Qufu Station After the Closing Ceremony</p>
<p>After the 10th annual meeting of the China Economic Society was held in Qingdao, the members arrived in Jinan at 6:00 PM on August 28. On the 29th, they attended a banquet hosted by Han Fuju, Chairman of Shandong Province. Due to rain, they only visited Baotu Spring and the Guangzhi Institute, and were unable to visit the other scenic spots. At 8:00 PM that afternoon, they took three sleeping cars on the Jinpu train to Tai'an. On the morning of the 30th, they took rope sedan chairs from Tai'an Station to Mount Tai. On the way, they encountered more than a dozen plainclothes soldiers holding submachine guns, wearing white twill cloth children's hats with a red ribbon, white cloth short jackets with short sleeves to the elbows and no slits, gray trousers like ordinary soldiers, and gray cloth shoes with rubber soles. The porters said they were Feng Lao's guards. They went up the mountain to Guandi Temple at the foot of the mountain. Dozens of soldiers were stationed in the hall behind the first Han cypress, with the shoulder badges of the 29th Army. The plaque of another hall, Liuxian Shrine, was white paper with black characters pasted on the door frame, with six tablets for Chen Mingshu, Jiang Guangding, Cai Tingkai, Dai Ji, Wang Hu, and Zhu Qinglan. Feng himself lived in the Wuxian Shrine, to the right of the main road to Yuhuang Peak, which was not a necessary stop for tourists.</p>
<p>On the 31st, they arrived in Qufu and immediately took mule carts to the county seat to visit the Confucius Temple and his former residence, and to visit Kong Decheng, the Duke Yansheng, who was only fourteen years old. In the afternoon, they left the city to Konglin. Although it had been renovated, the gun holes and gun emplacements in the surrounding walls and battlements, and the bullet holes in the nearby civilian houses, were still enough to show the traces of the battle between the 19th Route Army, the Central Army, and the Jin Army. That evening, the attending members dispersed in different directions at Qufu Station to go south and north. The 10th annual meeting of the China Economic Society was adjourned.</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Association Raises Funds for Shanghai School's Second Aircraft</p>
<p>Yesterday's Letter to School Principals</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Association sent a letter to the principals of various schools in the city yesterday to raise funds for Shanghai School's second aircraft, which reads: "To the esteemed principals, in the previous fundraising for Shanghai School's first aircraft, we were deeply moved by the enthusiastic fundraising efforts of our colleagues in the city's education sector, which resulted in a huge amount. This patriotic fervor is truly admirable.

<p>Opening of Citizen Education Center and People's Supplementary Schools</p>
<p>Joint Opening Ceremony Held</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Citizen Education Center, in order to provide general out-of-school people with the opportunity for remedial education, held a grand literacy campaign last month and then engaged in enrollment. More than 200 students enrolled. The center then divided the students into four classes according to their age and educational level, including out-of-school children's class, elementary division of people's school, advanced division of people's school, and supplementary class, and specified the class time and classrooms, and gave admission certificates. Yesterday, a joint opening ceremony was held, and men, women, old and young gathered together, which was a grand occasion. It is reported that the books used by each class have been carefully selected. It has now been decided that the short-term primary school textbooks will be used for the children's class in the Chinese language course, the new era literacy textbooks will be used for the elementary division of the people's school, the vernacular active page anthology will be used for the advanced division of the people's school and the supplementary class.

The center has also selected teaching materials and compiled teaching plans for other subjects such as arithmetic family affairs and crafts.</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Orders Investigation into the Enrollment of the New China College</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to the private New China College the day before yesterday, stating that the school has not yet been approved for establishment by the Ministry of Education through the Bureau, and its affiliated middle school has not been approved for record by the Bureau. It is inappropriate to enroll students without authorization. In addition to sending a letter to various newspapers to stop publishing the school's enrollment advertisements from now on, you should immediately comply with this order without violation. Yesterday, the Bureau issued another order to the school, stating that the Bureau had previously ordered the school to stop publishing enrollment advertisements because the school had not been approved for establishment by the Ministry of Education through the Bureau. Now, the Ministry of Education has sent a telegram stating that the private New China College has proceeded to publish enrollment advertisements without being approved for establishment by the Ministry, which is inconsistent with the regulations. You should immediately convey to the person in charge of the school to stop immediately and report the handling situation. Therefore, you are ordered to comply with this order and reply truthfully without delay, lest you interfere with the ban.</p>
<p>Pudong Middle School Holds Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>Since Xu Zhi took over as the principal of Pudong Middle School this summer, he has been determined to reform and has hired teachers and staff who are highly selected for the time being. He also advocates production education and is very enthusiastic. Therefore, the number of new students this year broke the school's record in the past three years. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the school held an opening ceremony, attended by Mayor's representative Li Dachao, Du Gang, the representative of the Municipal Education Bureau, guests Chen Jicheng, Zhang Wuqin, Xu Zeyi, etc., directors Jiang Qilin, Jiang Xiangqing, Song Chongjiu, Xu Ze, Zhang Shuqin, Gao Naitong, Wang Keming, and a total of more than 600 teachers, staff, and students. After the rituals were performed, Principal Xu reported, briefly stating that Pudong has always been known for its science subjects. In today's advocacy of production education, its position is even more important. I have come to Changpu Middle School this time with the attitude of speaking less and doing more, and with the spirit of cooperation between teachers and students, I will work together with all teachers, staff, and students to restore the past glory of Pudong Middle School. I hope that the entire school can be consistent in the future: (1) be down-to-earth, (2) unite sincerely, and (3) strictly abide by discipline, then the future is bright and promising. Next, the Mayor's representative, the Education Bureau's representative, and the district chief of the third police district gave speeches successively. At the end, Principal Xu expressed his gratitude, and the ceremony was completed and the meeting adjourned. Yesterday morning, the school authorities specially borrowed a shallow-water gunboat and stopped at the Xinguang Wharf to pick up and drop off guests, so even though the hurricane was running, it was still very convenient. It is heard that the school, in view of the eagerness of students from afar to study, has specially set a supplementary examination on the 10th of this month. Those who are justified and willing to receive strict training can send a letter to the school's teaching affairs office at Liuliqiao, Pudong, to register.</p>
<p>Opening of the Chinese Medical College</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Chinese Hospital by the Shanghai Municipal Chinese Medicine Association and its relocation, it has been thriving. The number of students who registered for the exam this year was very enthusiastic. The summer vacation ended yesterday (1st), and the opening ceremony was held in the hospital auditorium. Two or three hundred teachers, students, and guests attended. After the rituals were performed, Dean Xue Wenyuan's health was not suitable, so Deputy Dean Jiang Wenfang represented him, reporting on the overall situation of the hospital's expansion. The teachers and staff successively gave speeches, and the specially invited lecturer Ding Fubao, etc., gave a lecture on the general treatment of tuberculosis. After the ceremony was completed and the photography was taken, the teaching affairs meeting was continued, and it was decided to start class on the 4th of this month. It is heard that the expansion of the enrollment and the continued applicants can still be accommodated. The hospital's affiliated hospital will also open within days.</p>
<p>Old Students of Jiangnan College New Slogan</p>
<p>Going Back to the Alma Mater</p>
<p>Since the expansion of Jiangnan College in this city, the atmosphere has been renewed. The old students of the law department who transferred to other schools last time were all happy to hear the news of the alma mater's development and planned to carry out the movement of "Going Back to the Alma Mater". According to the survey, there are already more than 200 people who have returned to the alma mater to register. In order to realize their proposal, the college authorities specially hired educators Jiang Jianbai, Fang Huanru, Dai Jilian, and Ji Shiyuan as oral examination members of the enrollment committee. As for the courses of the specialized subjects attached to the college, they have also been scheduled, such as the research on the Tibet issue, the research on the Mongolia issue, and the research on the Xinjiang issue in the reclamation department, which are particularly new and meet the needs.</p>
<p>Peicheng School Establishes Guangdong Class</p>

<p>New News from the White Goose Painting School</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Private White Goose Painting Supplementary School at the intersection of Aiwanyi Road and Kade Road published enrollment advertisements, those who sent letters to ask for chapters have been unusually enthusiastic. The school relies on its six-year glorious history to run the school with a lot of spirit. This autumn, it has reorganized its internal affairs to reach the best possible period. In addition to purchasing dozens of plaster models during the summer vacation, it has recently added several new-style plaster models, which are scattered in the four rooms to avoid crowding. The school's home tutoring department is presided over by famous artist Pan Sitong. Pan has won many awards at home and abroad. The pencil and watercolor paintings he published have been reprinted several times. The model texts used in the correspondence department are all from Pan's pen and the art letters of famous artists Fang Xuelu and Chen Qiucao. Looking around the country, if you want to find a perfect painting correspondence school with years of experience, you can only find it here. The school has a dormitory, which is very clean and spacious,</p>
<h3>Report of the Truth</h3>
<p>During the meeting, the main leader of the association, Mr. Michaeloff, gave a report, stating roughly: "I am deeply honored by your presence today. The Russian Chamber of Commerce is purely a commercial organization that has been engaged in import and export trade between China and Russia for many years, and it is well known to the business community. Recently, there have been reports stating that this association has political functions and conspiracies. After investigation, it was fabricated by Ms. Marison, a former employee who has been dismissed from this association. This news was first discovered in the local White Russian newspaper, which is known for its habitual slander and was not given attention. Recently, however, Chinese and Western newspapers have continued to disclose it, and the impact is significant, relating to the relations between China and Russia. Therefore, we solemnly refute the rumors and report the truth of the incident to you, in order to avoid misunderstandings among the public."</p>
<h3>Sino-Russian Trade</h3>
<p>Mr. Michaeloff then published a written statement on the issue of Sino-Russian trade. The original text reads: "When studying Sino-Soviet trade, the Chinese press and the general public pay the most attention to the two issues of import surplus and export surplus, and the Soviet Union's trade policy towards China. At the same time, they often talk about the proposal of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance to establish a Sino-Russian Trade Bureau. Therefore, my speech today will focus on the study of these three issues. Sino-Soviet trade did not start today. Since the Soviet revolution, Chinese people have increasingly held a dominant position in Sino-Soviet trade. China has been allowed to maintain its advantage in export surplus in trade with the Soviet Union. It is estimated that in the sixteen years since the Soviet revolution, the value of China's export surplus in trade with the Soviet Union has reached 459,000,000 customs taels. If you compare this figure with the huge import surplus in China's trade with other countries, you can clearly understand the issue of China's export surplus in Sino-Soviet trade.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Import Surplus</h3>
<p>Commentators all say that in recent years, China has been in a losing position in Sino-Soviet trade. This is indeed a fact. According to customs statistics, during this period, China's import surplus in Sino-Soviet trade reached 10,000,000 yuan. However, given the great hope for China's future trade with the Soviet Union, this import surplus phenomenon can be remedied immediately. What should be explained here is that the formation of this figure has other reasons. First, soybeans purchased by the Soviet Union during this time were not included in Chinese customs statistics. At the same time, the second largest commodity imported into the Soviet Union is Chinese tea. The import of Chinese tea into the Soviet Union accounts for 30% of its total exports. Some types of Chinese tea are almost entirely purchased by the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union has many difficulties in purchasing Chinese tea. For example, it is not a problem for the Soviet Union to purchase goods on credit in other tea-producing countries, but it becomes a rather difficult problem in China. Therefore, if Chinese tea wants to expand its exports to the Soviet Union, it should seek to provide at least the same conditions as other countries. Looking back at the history of Sino-Soviet trade, the Soviet Union is certainly very willing to purchase Chinese goods, but this also depends on the conditions given by the Chinese to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has never imported many goods into China. Even in the case of the most recent half year, goods from the United States imported into China accounted for 20% of China's total imports, Australia accounted for 11%, the United Kingdom accounted for 10%, Japan accounted for 9.8%, and the Soviet Union only accounted for 2%. From this, it can be seen that the propaganda of so-called Soviet goods encroaching on the Chinese market is completely unfounded.</p>
<h3>Competition from National Products</h3>
<p>Furthermore, the goods imported by the Soviet Union into China not only do not compete with Chinese national products, but also promote the development of Chinese industries. According to the current state of Chinese industries, some goods have to be purchased from abroad, such as kerosene, wood, and seafood. At the same time, Soviet industries have very little connection with other countries, so their products, once they reach China, compete with the goods of other countries, breaking the monopoly of European and American goods, and the prices of goods fall as a result, and China benefits from it. According to the first half of this year, the Soviet Union imported a total of 480,000 gold units of fish, 27,000 gold units of seafood, 554,000 gold units of gasoline, 1,198,000 gold units of kerosene, 913,000 gold units of wood (most of which are round logs most needed by Chinese timber factories), and 613,000 gold units of cloth. Among the above items, only cloth seems to be a commodity that competes with Chinese national products. However, it must be pointed out here that other countries imported 32,000,000 gold units of cloth during the same period. The Soviet Union's import of cloth is only 1.9 per thousand of this. Who would say that this small proportion poses a dangerous competition with China? As mentioned above, China occupies a very advantageous position in export trade to the Soviet Union, and the number of Soviet goods imported into China is extremely small, so the development of Sino-Soviet trade will undoubtedly have great hope.</p>
<h3>Establishment of a Special Bureau</h3>
<p>Furthermore, commentators often say that the proposed establishment of a trade bureau with Russia by the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance is closely related to the future of Sino-Soviet trade. According to the mission of this trade bureau, it is to comprehensively plan all Sino-Soviet trade business. There are many reasons for its establishment. The most important is that China defends its trade. However, if you understand the above situation, you will know that since there is no aggression, what need is there for self-defense? What we do not understand is that the Soviet Union's imports account for only 2% of the total imports, and why is its degree of danger even greater than the imports of other countries that account for 98%? Why treat the Soviet Union with special eyes and take special steps to deal with it? I believe that if this move can be avoided, then the hope for the development of trade between China and the Soviet Union will be great. This kind of hope can in fact be realized, and it is also the common wish of both parties to realize it.</p>
<h3>The Silk Factory Strike in Zhabei Expands</h3>
<p>A total of 36 factories participated</p>
<p>Work slowdown in the concession area resumed yesterday morning</p>
<p>The workers of 14 silk factories including Lu Baotai, due to opposition to the factory side adopting the piece-rate system, jointly declared a strike on the afternoon of the previous day. Yesterday morning, more than 6,000 workers from 22 silk factories including Hong Niu in the Xinzha area joined the strike, and the situation was quite serious. The work slowdown in the concession area subsided after yesterday morning. The silk factories in Hongkou are still operating as usual. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Expansion of the Labor Strike</h3>
<p>The workers of 14 factories including Shi Tai, Wu Yi, Chu Xin, Fuxing, Mao Feng, Fu Yuan of Changan Road in Zhabei, as well as Yu Yuan, Xing Yuanji of Yutong Road, and Hongtai of Gonghe Road and Guangfu Road, totaling more than 2,000 workers, due to opposition to the factory side changing to the piece-rate system, jointly declared a strike on the afternoon of the previous day. Yesterday morning, all factories did not sound their steam whistles and automatically stopped work. The workers formed teams and went to the Xinzha area to persuade all factories to participate uniformly. Silk factories including Hongsheng, Yuanxin, Xie Feng, Xie He, Shen Tai, Fu Yuan, Yuan Feng, Mao Feng, Jia Tai, Chunmei Ruifeng, Qian Yuan, Meifeng, and Hongchun, a total of 22 factories, joined one after another, and the situation was quite serious. In total, 34 silk factories in the Zhabei and Xinzha districts participated in the strike, with approximately 8,000 workers or more.</p>
<h3>Concession Area Quickly Settled</h3>
<p>Yuyuan Silk Factory on Xinlaji Bang North Guoging Road in the concession area also announced the adoption of the piece-rate system the previous day. The workers expressed their dissatisfaction and implemented a work slowdown after entering the factory at 5:30 yesterday morning. After the factory manager declared that this system would not be adopted, the workers expressed their satisfaction and immediately returned to work as usual. Others, such as Xiangyuan on Gansu Road, Taixin, Jingwei, and Yuanhe on Alabasters Road, all started work as usual.</p>
