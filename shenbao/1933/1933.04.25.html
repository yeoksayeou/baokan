<p>社會主義之學說。雖猶爲資本主義列國之所仇視。而社會主義之雛形。則已濔漫於資本主義國際之間。何以言之。資本主義之主要形態。爲生産資本之私有。而生産資本私有之進展。則賴於債權債務關係之確立。及隨之而起之信用制度之澎漲。資産階級剝削所得之剩餘勞動。聚積而爲債權。轉變而爲生産資本。再藉債權以榨取利息。藉滋生之生産資本。以作進一步之剝削。旦夕滋長。而成爲現代極雄偉之資本勢力。故債權也者。一面爲生産資本滋生之階梯。而一面則形成金融資本勢力之元素。此所以在資本主義法典中。債權關爲專編。行政司法之工作。半在維持債權之尊嚴。負債而不清償。小則不齒於鄉里。大則受辱於囹圄。蓋惟如此。乃始足以保持資産階級之威權於不墜也。然今則如何。蘇聯之宣布帝俄時代國際債權之無效也。舉世譁然。認爲叛逆。曾幾何時。而戰債之圖賴。乃起於歐洲列强之間。圖賴之範圍。復及於躬自簽約之債務。較之蘇聯。殆更變本加厲。於是而所謂條約。所謂信用。所謂債權債務。在國際關係上。殆已蕩掃無遺。觀感所及。大勢所趨。其將蔓延而及於社會關係間。殆甚顯也。</p>
<p>其次則任何財産之聚積。倘逹於最高之階段。而集中於少數之人。則必至窮於運用。而成坐斃之勢。藝薪取火。薪過多則擁塞而火焰熄滅。取食充飢。食過飽則停滯而轉傷脾腑。目下社會之病態。爲生産工具集中於少數之人。此生産工具。復因生産力之偉大。甚至無求於多數之勞工。然其弊也。則爲生産品之日積月累而無由覓得適當消費之人數。緣是而成空前之恐慌。目下國際間之病態。則爲黃金集中於少數之國家。而在此少數國家之間。復集中於少數金融巨頭之手。美利堅經迭次金融之恐慌。而若干大銀行之營業報告。則均以現金準備遠過法定成分以自詡。而其弊也。則弱小者枯竭以埀斃。强大者膨脹而擁腫。枯竭之甚。則反動起而相率宣告對於黃金勢力之革命。此</p>
<h3>泛舟河上羅麥暢談經濟大局</h3>
<p>對安定世界貨幣原則商得同意</p>
<p>大可增進軍縮及經濟會議成功</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統與英相麥唐諾今日在波吐瑪河上遨游終日、</p>
<p>（首次聲明）歸後共發表一文、聲稱、今日專從事透澈研究軍縮會議事、雙立皆覺其談話結果大可增進軍縮會議與世界經濟會議成功之氣象云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（二次聲明）白宮旋發第二次聲明、語甚簡短、表示羅麥兩人對於定定貨幣、尤其安定美金、亦與赫禮歐抱同一心理、謂刻正亟切求一方法、俾可安定金元於堅定基礎之上、而世界經濟會議中之貨幣問題、亦經討論云云、</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美總統與英首相關於戰債減稅與恢復國際貨幣本位等問題、</p>
<h3>世界經濟會召集期</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）紐約時報今日消息謂英美專家現所研究之要點、以期在世界經濟會議以前謀取英美同意者、其中有决定金銀間等價以固幣制之多方面條約一條、其所議之等價、大約爲金百分之三十與銀百分之五云、該報又稱、英相麥唐納將於一星期内向世界各國發出世界經濟會議定六月十五日在倫敦召集之通告、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>已有許多點商得同意、故經濟專家皆認此番談話、可稱爲最有效果與進行神速之國際會議、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今夜白宮内召集經濟專家與金融專家會議、此間各界皆認爲美總統與英相對於安定世界貨幣方式在原則上已臻同意之表示、此輩專家在白宮召集會議以前、曾與美國務卿赫爾及英大使林德賽開會討論、迨羅斯福總統與英相麥唐納在波吐瑪河上泛舟旣歸、立即召集白宮會議、至羅麥兩人在舟中所談、據聞凡有關各國之問題、無一不提及、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>即所謂停止金本位也。黃金之龔斷。已起國際間之幣制革命矣。生産工具之龔斷。其關爭之形勢。亦復日趨銳化於資本主義列强社會之間。其必繼國際間幣制革命之告成。而終使生産工具之龔斷。粉碎以盡。蓋亦時間問題而已耳。</p>
<p>美利堅對於此國際間之幣制革命。殆亦已竭盡其掙扎之能事。終胡佛政府之世。固無日不努力於金本位之維持。而競選之際。民主黨之政綱。亦猶以保持幣制尊嚴爲已任。然所謂羅斯福政策者。旣以致力於減低關稅壁壘。抬高物價。及解决失業問題爲其主點。吾人即已斷定其除廢止金本位外。别無可循之途徑。蓋不廢止金本位而圖減關稅壁壘。則外貨傾銷之結果。物價必至再度低落。失業必至再度增加。全盤計劃。適自陷於矛盾。如曰求國際之合作也。則金本位維持之企圖。適爲外交上予人要挾之重大弱點。自身退讓過甚。旣有所不甘。對人希望過高。亦徒成畫餅。要之一年餘美利堅對於金本位制之掙持。已逹力竭聲嘶之階段。而外在矛盾之銳化。又處處使内在矛盾。隨而加速銳化。爲減低未來華盛頓會議中列國所提出交換條件之力量計。爲整個經濟組織着想。捨屈服於國際間之幣制革命勢力外。無他途也。</p>
<p>吾人更有可概見者。其一則當此英法代表在大西洋航程之中。美利堅以迅雷不及掩耳之手段。宣告金本位制之廢止。使此滿懹熱望有所挾以來者。頓失其提出對案之主要目標。掃興自不俟言。固知所謂華盛頓會議者。仍不外歷來列强間國際會議所表演爾詐我虞之一齣活劇。以此而言國際合作。母亦類於與虎謀皮。其二則大不列顛自停止金本位後。在貿易上利用其低廉之幣價。以侵入美利堅之市場。日本復以其更低廉之幣價。以侵入英國之市塲。種種一切國内經濟恢復繁榮之誇耀。殆均不出以隣爲壑之結果。今者美利堅又放棄其金本位矣。在美利堅之觀點。此殆爲最後掙扎中之最後一注强心針。而在整個資本主義之觀點。則美利堅之所得。即爲英日之所失。乘除相殺。結果殆等於零目下之國際商品市塲雖因之而起劇烈之變化。然　花一現。至高之效果。亦不過如胡佛停付戰債之先例耳。</p>
<h3>專家研究平準幣制</h3>
<p>英美意見未能一致</p>
<p>今日英美專家之討論、内容未曾宣佈、但衆信除平準幣制之問題外、英美專家亦考慮世界膨脹事、擬由財力殷富之國合組財政機關、沿尋常貿易之途徑、扶助財力貧弱之國、如是則物價可望提高、而國際貿易亦可恢復、各專家今晚與英相及美總統晤商、據今日紐約講壇報稱、今之會議乃以精明腦筋了解眞相之證、而非樂園中各物盡屬可愛之態度、預料此次會議或可産生國際關稅休戰之結果云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>本日專家將討論國際全部經濟情形時、對於各問題所告同意之程度、報告兩國執政、並備兩人之諮詢、至各專家未能同意諸點、聞將由羅麥兩人繼續親自商榷、迄討論歷三小時後、乃商定各專家秉承新訓令、明晨再與國務卿赫爾開會討論、然後報告白宮、羅斯福與麥唐納則守候專家報告後、於明日下午重行會商、</p>
<p>（紐約）此間專家皆以爲美幣與英幣之價格、應同時固定之、英人專家主張美金三元半、合英金一鎊、而美人則主張美金四元合英金一鎊、並欲固定美金爲八角五分、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據可靠消息、安定金元方法、實爲專家會議中意見殊異最甚之點、蓋原提計劃中、金元價値約在五角至八角五分之間、英鎊價値在合新金元三元至三元八角之間、但欲在此兩數之間折衷一適當價値、各專家主張不一、意見大異但據接近專家會議者言、逆料此事要亦不難解决、第在考慮安定幣價之際、不能不顧及小國利益因小國多有依賴大國以安定其貨幣價値者也（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）英美兩國專家在國務院會議經濟問題時、美國專家提出國際間貨幣貶價之大體計畫、其基礎即係下開三項原則、（一）貨幣貶價、須由各國同時行之、（二）貨幣貶價、當使各種貨幣降至現行實在價値以下、（三）貨幣貶價、應使現金自動平均分配、第二項所謂實在價値、當指他國貨幣重行整理以後該貨幣所代表之價値、而此價値并當自動保持、而無須加以干涉、此外美國專家以爲如關稅限制取銷以後、各種貨幣價値必將增高、因此愈能取銷關稅壁壘之國家、其貨幣之貶價、亦當愈大云、英美兩國專家業於昨日午後六時對於羅斯福總統及麥唐納首相所提出之問題、審議完畢、并於晚間九點向白宮提出報告書、各該專家今日仍當在國務院繼續開會、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>銀輔幣問題考慮中</h3>
<p>至關於白銀問題、今日華盛頓方面談者絶鮮、據聞羅麥兩人曾考慮廣用白銀爲輔幣、而未提及複本位、觀察時事者以爲此乃美國方面之問題、第他國代表亦不得不加以考慮而已、目下美參院内大多數贊成添鑄銀幣、但究應授權政府鼓鑄若干、則白銀派領袖似正待總統與麥唐納及赫禮歐晤商後、提出一數目、然後照數通過、至總統與麥唐納之談話、料在明日當可完畢、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今夜有未曾直接參加談話之經濟專家數人聲稱、據渠等所聞、總統擬與英相及赫禮歐立即討論重納金元金鎊於金本位之方法、及廣用白銀於鑄造輔幣之可能性、但渠等尚不期望三人提議普遍採用複本位也、又參院外交委員會主席畢德門出席國務卿赫爾與專家之會議後向人表示、本日之討論以白銀之前途爲主、其所討論者全屬技術方面、各人意見雖不無大異處、但談論之際、始終融洽友好、又當各專家召赴白宮會議時、聞於國外所傅談話情形已造成類似僵局之說、亦絲毫未能徵實云、（二十三國民電）</p>
<h3>赫禮歐將繼麥唐納後分别與羅斯福談話</h3>
<p>希望政治經濟合併解决</p>
<p>技術方面勢將有所變更</p>
<p>（華盛頓）法前總理赫禮歐雖已於美總統泛舟河上時抵美京、今夜並未參加白宮會議、聞其與美總統之第一次直接討論、將在星期一晚間、赫氏今日接見新聞記者時、曾表示渠將於星期一面告羅斯福總統、法國擬維持金本位並願見美英等國早日安定幣價回復金本位、渠欲討論之問題雖衆、但擬首談金融危局、因渠覺非俟匯價安定之後、對於恢復世界之貿易、罕能有所進步也、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今後第二步、將爲羅斯福總統與法代表赫禮歐間之談話、赫氏到時、國務卿赫爾親往歡迎、赫禮歐對新聞記者稱、渠將提出國際安全之問題、渠以爲政治與經濟問題、必須合併研究云、赫抵華盛頓後、即與駐美法大使及專家會商一切、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）晚間法國代表赫禮歐及代表團團員均在法國大使館便酌、赫禮歐并向報館記者宣言、謂美國放棄金本位一事、使彼與羅斯福總統所討論各問題之技術方面有所變更、但各問題之基本要點及談話之目的、則絶未變更、蓋此次談話固以復興世界經濟爲目的也、赫禮歐又謂世界經濟會議原係由洛桑會議所提議、當時德國補償實際上業已取銷、赫禮歐繼謂法國對於經濟會議至爲關切、但對於前來華盛頓使命之性質、則不欲更作切實之說明、最後對於羅斯福總統備極崇敬揄揚、稱之爲（大勇之人）云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>赫以佛郎代表自命</h3>
<p>（巴黎）（小巴黎人報）隨法國代表團赴美之特派記者、頃由（法蘭西島）郵船發出電報稱、美國放棄金本位之後、歐洲各國如法國荷蘭及瑞士均維持金本位之統一障線、而不步美國後塵、此信傅來、代表團各專家印象良好、又據（事業報）特派員報告、赫禮歐曾宣稱、（予係代表（佛郎）者、易詞言之、即予僅以觀察員資格參加談話、對於佛郎不能有所左右）云云</p>
<h3>抵紐約時發表宣言</h3>
<p>（紐約）法國前總理赫禮歐奉命來美、參加華府談話、頃已乘（法蘭西島）號郵船抵埠、當即發表宣言、用無線電廣播、其詞曰、（予足踐美國領土、願以法國政府及法國人民名義、對美國民族致其景仰、美國人民富於思想、具堅决之氣概、其感遇之各種困難、與吾國相同、而其人民能儘力以排除之、失業之禍、任何國家均不能免、美國人民多數家庭均蒙其害、此中苦情、予深知之、故對於美國人民尤抱無限之同情、予此行由法國最有學識之專家中選擇數人、携與俱來、以與貴國總統會晤、冀以極自由極誠懇之態度、商討可行之法、以救世界經濟之恐慌、而解脫經濟恐慌所惹起之痛苦、予爲確信和平之人、故予之工作目的、僅在求和平之實現、惟以爲和平之建設、當於政治及經濟範圍内同時求之、法國爲酷愛和平之民族、予當竭盡所能、俾法國和平志願能表白於世、最近吾人在大西洋舟中所聞之事、固足使問題中之技術上綱領爲之改變、然政治上及精神上綱領則依然如故、吾人仍保持完全之信心、吾人此來、蓋抱無限度之合作誠意、以與美國政府及人民相見、而不懹他意者也、英相麥唐納與予爲舊雨、一九二四年在倫敦一九三二年在洛桑與日内瓦予二人固嘗通力合作、以謀各民族之親善、今又與之把晤、予以欣幸爲何如耶云云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>動搖中的日本政狀（日本通信）</h3>
<p>日本政府當前有兩個困難</p>
<p>中東路與太平洋經濟問題</p>
<p>日本得到了（滿洲）、總算是了結牠幾十年的素願、最近又很安全的襲佔了熱河、那眞是意外的僥倖、照尋常的道理講、牠該是心滿意足、而且繁榮逹到頂點了、何以牠還是高唱着非常時期、還更進一步說是超非常時期呢、原來日本帝國主義之外强中乾、早已爲世所共知、其使用挑動對外戰爭、激發其國内人民元始的侵略心理、作爲牠現實國内一切矛盾的烟幕、遮蔽牠自已經濟上、政治上、一切的醜惡、使一般大衆忘却眼前的痛苦、這種的嗎啡針確實有效、把一般日本人麻醉了之外、還開疆拓土佔領了中國四百三十多萬方里土地、但依舊無濟於日本之窮、牠所謂的非常時期、還繼續擴大、這到并不是爲了中國高唱（抵抗到底）、致日本作戰困難、也不是日本軍隊碰着中國軍隊的反攻而受什麽大損失、乃是中國以外的困難增加、同時日本國内一般的社會不安增大、</p>
<p>第一是中東路問題、在日本方面自從驅走了蘇馬以後、就想借題發揮、把牠收買到日本手裹、作爲牠自已的工具、以便完全呑下東三省、殊不知蘇聯决不相讓、把機車·客車·貨車·一千多輛開到蘇聯境内去、在本月中旬曾有兩次國際列車停開、表面上是蘇聯與傀儡國的衝突、實際上不消說是日蘇兩國的爭端、在蘇聯固然决不願意和日本發生戰爭、致有碍牠的建設工作、日本也不肯輕於啓釁、以惹起嚴重的結果、現在這種磨拳擦掌對蘇的様子是做給英國看、同時對英國表示好意的舉動、說牠日本確實在防制蘇聯、并且將更進一步向多倫·張家口·一帶進兵、把内蒙放在牠的囊袋裹、表示牠對資本主義的忠實、對侵略的勇敢、可是這種行動要靠軍隊作主力、要更大量的軍費、這是牠第一種困難、</p>
<p>第二是太平洋上經濟競爭、因爲美國金融恐慌發生以來、日本對美生絲輸出將受極嚴重的打撃、假如美國果然放棄金本位制、則日本輸入美棉將蒙不利、况且美國所領導的美洲經濟聯合、勢必給日本以更厲害的攻撃、英國從前是日本的同盟、最近也還維持着友好關係、但在經濟上、特别是中國和印度市塲、紡織品的競爭終於没有方法可以調和、而英國的經濟聯合又是當世最有力、并且渥太華會議以來施行最有效的、這些都是日本的對頭、是助成日本帝國主義非常時期的第二種因素、</p>
<p>所以日本政局天天傅說將有政變、特别是政友會和國民同盟暗中進行倒閣運動、照常理說政友會有二百九十八個議席、國民同盟有二十幾個議席、無疑的倒閣力量有餘、但是吵去吵來、只有說是高橋是清（財政部長）的辭職問題發生、内閣發生缺痕、齋藤纔會倒台、聯帶辭職纔會發生、前幾天司法部長小山松吉、因爲司法官赤化問題引起責任關係、勢不能不提出辭呈、但經禦召慰留、即已消滅、高橋辭職更弄成玄妙的心境關係了、豈不是日本政治上的奇事、</p>
<p>說穿了原不値得什麽、上面所述的兩種困難、使日本政府更陷於苦境、這種苦境又是日本軍部自已製造出來的、現在要打開出路、在軍閥的意見是不要政黨作主力、而是要軍部作前鋒、尤其是關於侵略華北的事、更要一力猛幹、趁英美關係不圓滿的時候、更容易造成新的事實、所以高橋雖受政友會的脅制想辭職、拆散齋藤内閣、可是軍部要支持齋藤、因此高橋的辭職須五一·五事件之後、或等到八月陸軍公判該案件、甚至年底司法公判該案件之後亦未可知、則齋藤内閣還可以維持現狀、日本軍隊仍然繼續壓迫華北、（一九三三·四·十八於東京）</p>

<p>馮氏首述前線之近况、據談、前數日前線異常沉寂、無甚劇戰、我軍士氣甚壯、然軍械與給養之缺乏、實非後方人民所能想像、將士雖有拚死之心、然少拚死之具、南方多河流、不利於敵人之作戰、北方多平原、敵軍之坦克車裝甲車砲車以及馬隊、得以縱橫馳騁、無所阻碍、我軍非特無此種利器、以與敵人週旋、即欲得一長射程之大砲以抗拒敵人而亦不可得、敵軍之飛機時時　翔於我方陣地之上、施行轟炸、在此種情况之下、欲驅敵軍於國門之外、其可得乎、</p>
<h3>人心麻木</h3>
<p>馮氏繼謂我軍之軍械與給養雖形缺乏、然以力量言、我軍雖不能驅敵人出國門之外、然最低限度、收復熱河失地、實非難事、但目前非特熱河失地尚未收復、長城各口又已相繼陷落、此何故歟、我敢爲國人告曰、此非力量之問題、實乃决心之問題也、共匪之騷擾於江西、西南之徒唱高調、不見一兵一卒、此皆與抗日軍事失利有密切之關係、即以人民言、平津距兩國戰爭之前線、僅百餘里耳、人民之熙攘如故、人心麻木、此直亡國之現象也、馮氏旋詢記者以滬上頗爲安謐乎、記省對之曰、然、燈紅酒綠之中、紙醉金迷之窟、人民熙熙攘攘、一若不知國難之臨頭、太平之景象歟、亡國之預兆歟、言竟、相與默然者久之、</p>
<h3>學校南遷</h3>
<p>旋記者詢馮氏以平津各校行將南遷之說確否、馮氏謂、唐山交大現已遷滬、其他清華北大師大等校、聞亦擬南遷、然南方能有適當之房屋以容平津各校南遷乎、儀器與圖書可以南遷校舍其可南遷乎、平津爲危險之地、誰能保證京滬將來不成爲今日之平津乎、平津各校繼故宮古物而南遷矣、然平津之國土能南遷乎、智識階級之行動如是、此實令人痛心、</p>
<h3>昨午飛杭</h3>
<p>馮氏末謂、本人此次來滬、原擬轉道赴粤一行、現粤行業已打銷、將於今日午後飛杭、參觀航空學校、探視現在該校求學之馮大同學、北返之期、刻尚未定云、</p>

<p>計公大東華等十家</p>
<p>减工辦法並不一致</p>

<h3>日紗慘落</h3>
<p>據日本紡績界方面消息、連年因世界經濟之不景氣、紗價一落千丈、不僅華商紗廠受重大之打撃、即日商紗廠、蒙受種種損失、亦何莫不然、日紗銷塲、向以印度南洋及我國各省内地爲大宗、乃最近各地皆以經濟市况不佳、購買力縮減、日紗幾至無人顧問、以致現紗存積、損失至鉅、日紗廠鑒於此種情况、足以陷於破壤狀態、故曾於日前召集豐田·大康·同興·内外棉·東華·日華·裕豐·華豐·公大·上海·等、日紗廠十家聯席會議、討論補救辦法、會議結果、决實行减工、俾减少生産、以維現狀、</p>

<h3>鐵部邀絲紗業會商運輸調劑辦法</h3>
<p>俞棪昨請兩業代表茶話</p>
<p>華商紗廠减工事、政府及各界均極　心、　此事之發生、足以證明世界不景氣之潮流、已波及黃浦江岸、而威脅我國社會經濟之生命、鐵道部鑒於華紗銷呼不暢、於鐵路運輸調劑之旨、不無重要關係、特派業務司長俞棪來滬、於昨午四時在華安飯店招待絲紗兩業代表徵詢意見、商討救濟辦法、計到紗業代表榮宗敬·聶潞生·徐靜仁·徐樊棠等、絲業代表沈驊臣朱靜庵·黃錦帆·等十餘人、由俞司長及兩路正副局長黃柏樵·吳紹曾·車務處長鄭寳照·等招待、茲將俞司長報告及兩業意見分述於後、</p>
<h3>俞棪報告</h3>
<p>紗布業此次因營業不振生産過剩、决議減工維持、並推派代表晉京向當局請顧商討救濟、鐵部顧部長鑒於工商業衰落在其成本計算上、鐵路當局亦負有一部份之責任、故不待諸君之遠道前來、特派本人來此就商、極盼將所受之痛苦及對於鐵路運價應如何低減之希望、詳爲說明、本人當儘速設法、以減免各業痛苦、</p>
<h3>紗業意見</h3>
<p>俞司長報告畢、卽請紗業代表榮宗敬及聶潞生兩氏陳述意見、略謂我國紗業原料十分之四、取給於美之紐約、印之孟買、本國原料、則採自山東及陜西·湖南·等省、惟以運價關係、多由水路運來、而其運費較之由國外運來已貴百分之三十、如由陜州轉洛陽來此、每担需價三元餘、由美印運滬、則尚不足二元、且對其本國商人尚有退還水脚百分之三十之辦法、以爲優待、更如日商在膠濟路或由日輪運輸、亦可得種種優待、故能以優越勢力、以競勝華商、我國人口衆多、衣食所需、爲數至鉅、以紗布而言、卽有地千萬紗錠、亦不敷所需、現在則僅有二百餘萬錠、尚有因營業衰敗而致停工者、若長此以往、恐更將減少、至日本在華紗廠、其情形則反是、自一九一二年之四十萬紗錠、現已增至二百餘萬錠、而尚在發展中、勢將盡奪國紗市塲以去、故希望（一）鐵路當局能與紗商密切聯絡、（二）能仿行回水辦法、退回百分之三十、（三）鐵路指導沿線農民植棉、能年增二百萬担、卽又減少漏巵一千萬元、惟其首要尚在減低運費、</p>
<h3>絲業意見</h3>
<p>繼由絲業代表沈驊臣、陳述意見云、絲繭爲江浙兩省特産、安徽·江西·雖亦有生産、但爲數不多、而上海絲商取給絲繭於浙省、無錫則取給於蘇省、故其關係於京滬滬杭甬兩路、較爲密切、兩路因軍運不多、故受苦尚少、惟運價則嫌太高、故近年來都改由水路運輸、雖時間較長、但爲减低成本起見、不得已而出此、浙省有繭區及絲區、如繭價低落、則自行繅製繭綢等、惟我國之絲以出口爲大宗、自缫增加、卽减少出口、與國計民生、關係至大、以前絲繭出口、年約六萬包、値一萬萬元、去年則銳减至一萬八千包、至絲繭運費、自錫至滬、因有水道競爭、故七折減收、而自浙斜橋至滬、則照價實收、商方雖曾呈請大部低减、未獲容納、而因車輛擁擠、或且在站擱置多日、橫受索價及損失、現在舉辦負責運輸、當可免除此項痛苦、尚望在繭期中多派車輛、儘速載運云、當經俞司長接受、並由車務處長鄭寳照詳爲解釋、請於繭期前派員與局方接洽云、</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>烈性楊花</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>春去也！山邊水涯有許多白衣冠的送客，彷彿在唱變微之歌：韶光畢兮酷日來，長春一去兮何日回？</p>
<p>白衣冠的送客是誰？便是紛紛飛舞的烈性楊花。楊花有水性的稱呼，這是侮辱它。楊花的性子却和烈士一般的烈。它是炎炎的赤日，逐走了可愛的陽春，便抱定着寗爲玉碎莫作瓦全的宗旨；它不再在樹枝上偷安了，紛紛的成羣結隊，要在山邊水涯去尋回那已逝的春光。唉！楊花太愚了已逝的春光怎麽可以尋取回來呢？但，楊花一切不顧的犠牲到底，毅然决然的要在酷日當令的底下尋回春光，拚着沾在泥裹落在水裹而終於骨化形消！楊花的烈性，楊花的偉大，確有令人欽佩的價値。</p>
<p>春去以後，依着大自然的順序，自有重來的日子；但是，關外的長春，已做了孤狸的窟穴，還有重來的日子麽？要在酷日的勢力範圍裹面，奪回長春，不知在何年何月才能够完成這偉大工作？</p>
<p>山邊水涯尋覓已逝春光的烈性楊花，分明是自然界中的義勇軍，沾泥的已沾泥了，落水的已落水了：但是，飄零在空中的楊花，依舊秉着大無畏的精神，而希望着逐去酷日，尋回春光。</p>
<p>楊花放心吧，依着大自然的順序，春光總會重來的啊。</p>
<h3>捧啟</h3>
<p>— 沃</p>
<p>捧是成功的必需條件；在臺上的需要捧，没上臺的更需要捧。這年頭因受捧而成名的人，眞如恒河之沙。没有人捧的根本上别想出名。你看那個舞臺上的ＸＸ泰斗，那個名人，那個皇后，那個交際花不是給人家捧出來的（捧），其中實含有生物學上的（共生作用。譬如說在臺上的要人有人捧則位置牢，臺下的要人有人捧則高調可以唱得格外響。而同時捧的人有的是盡了（食錄報恩）之責，有的則正候着隨自家主人走馬上任，二者間正有一種互相倚賴的作用在。</p>
<p>因爲（捧）之重要，所以古時候，孟嘗君有食客三千。現今要人的（走狗）更是多得不可勝數。</p>
<p>漪歟！（捧）之道，千古長存！</p>
<h3>蜜蜂的針</h3>
<p>— 沙菲</p>
<p>在嘴上高唱着獨身主義的人，實際上便是醉心戀愛者，這並不是掩飾，却是等待着時機。</p>
<p>○○○卑劣的人不能産生偉大的戀愛，輕浮的人，只知道一點戀愛的娛樂。○○○痛苦有二個極端，愈痛苦而愈快活，惟有情海中的人，才眞實地體騐到了全部。</p>
<p>○○○假使女子使男子愛慕只是美麗和天眞，那末女子在這二點消失後，情愛也自然而然會烟消雲散。</p>
<h3>烏篷船</h3>
<p>— 趙子明</p>
<p>我的故鄉紹興，的確是個山明水秀的所在，當桃紅柳綠，春光明媚中；登蘭亭，游東湖，其樂融融，環城内外，河流聚多，往來交通，非船不能成行。</p>
<p>烏篷船是故鄉的特産，船篷烏黑，以此得名，篷身是用竹蔑編成，篷上開有窓洞，嵌以透明魚鱗，船頭畫有虎面，，（三明瓦）（四明瓦）之稱。明瓦之多少，代表船艙的大小；大的可客十數人，是用櫓搖，小的能坐三四人，是用脚划，一名（脚划船）船夫划槳，以脚代手，開行迅速，神妙異常，汪洋無邊，一葉扁舟，誰說中個人不勇敢？</p>
<p>鄉間婦女，三五成羣，；進城購物，伊們都是天足，能用脚划船，雖没有摩登氣，但却含天然美！</p>
<p>近來城裹馬路建築。汽車行駛，但是烏篷船能適應環境的需要，價廉行便，雖是十七世紀的創造物。直到現在還不受時代的淘汰，實有留存的價値。汽車是爲守財奴，官老爺，擴張威勢的工具。大家都厭惡，雅號（鐵牛），倘如長此以往，不久必受排擠。而烏篷船自有它的長處，將永遠的保存下去。</p>
<h3>哭孫經笙師</h3>
<p>— 費文寳</p>
<p>吳江孫經笙先生延庚，主講民立中學埀念五年，循循善誘，誨人不倦，治事勤愼，數十年如一日。及門弟子，受其教益，成名而去者，先後有實業家李祖賢祖範昆仲，交際家蔣君毅，小說家周瘦鵑陸澹　。法律家蔣保釐等。而濫竽門下，以不舞之鶴，貽先生羞者，祇僕一人而已。</p>
<p>先生天性和易，美鬚髯，善飲酒，而自奉極儉。其長公子錫藩，任職美亞保險公司，處事勤奮，極得社會信仰，不幸數年前，先先生而逝，痛抱北郭，益傷老人情懹。在先生雖勉爲逹觀，而知先生者，莫不以晚年傷此克家之子、爲先生惜焉。</p>
<p>蘇頴傑師，長民立中學，嘗以仇蓉秋孫經笙先生，爲左右手。今先生旣逝，在蘇師缺一得力之助理，母校同學，失一良好之導師，而教育界又隕一明星矣。哀哉！</p>
<p>今母校諸師，特於月之二十三日，爲先生開會追悼於西門之關帝廟，是日知交故舊，及門桃李，不憚道遠，蒞會弔奠者逾數百人云。</p>

<p>江氏笑道：不！我作事就是這様，要一個人動手，一手作成功的事，自已也順心些。說着，抬着桌子，搬着椅子，忙個不了。趙翁手摸了鬍芔，不住的點頭。桂枝道：老太爺您瞧我媽的脾氣擰嗎？有事情情願一個人去作。趙翁笑道：不算擰，我也是這個様子的，這不光是爲了順心，作慣了事的人，瞧見人家作事，自已不作事，心裹怪難受的。江氏一拍手道：對了！老太爺，我就是這様想着。趙翁笑着摸了鬍子道：老太，您呌你大姑娘學自强，那用不着，讓她跟着您多學一點兒就是了。說着話時，伊娘兒倆將東西已經料理清楚，趙翁呌道：小林，把酒壺拿來，咱們先喝兩杯。小林聽說，提了壺進來，趙翁接着，斟了一杯，就遞到桌子正面放下，笑道：楊老太，你忙了半天上坐着，多喝一鐘。江氏蹲着請了個安道：這可不敢當您這大年紀，倒要您敬酒？我跟您回敬一杯吧？桂　枝心裹一機靈，就笑道：總算我年紀小些，我來斟酒得了。趙翁點點頭道：你這話說得有理，我就不客氣了。於是讓江氏上坐，趙翁和桂枝兩橫頭，江氏呌林坐在下方，他死也不肯。趙翁道：他不肯坐，就隨他罷。你勉强逼着他坐下來，他也吃得不順心的。不如我們吃完了。讓他一個人坐到櫉房裹去，愛吃多少，就吃多少。小林低了頭，只是呆站在一邊不作聲。桂枝斟完了酒，也坐下來斯斯文文的吃着。趙翁夾了幾塊羊肉在開水鍋子裹刷了幾刷，然後叉着羊肉向桂枝面前的小碗裹塞了下去，笑道：只管說小林坐着不能順心吃，你可别那様呀！老太，喝！難得的，咱們居然在一處過年，吃一個痛快。於是端起大杯子，向江氏舉了一舉。江氏喝了一口酒道：眞的，人事眞說不定，誰會想到今年過年叨擾老太爺這一餐呢？話可又說回來了，今年咱們在一處過年明年又知道那個在那裹呢？（五二）</p>

<h3>婚禮</h3>
<p>— 傅敬嘉</p>
<p>春假給了我一個參與婚禮的機會。我的職務是當一個男儐相。軍樂聲中，我和另一位男儐相挽着那穿著燕尾服的新郎的手臂緩緩地向禮堂走。没一個人不帶着歡樂的笑容。然而我是没分的。那軍樂聲，那紅紅綠綠的彩球，那掛着的對聯綢幛，那四周的人們，没一様使我感到興味。我要哭。我没法子趕走我心中的悲哀。</p>
<p>我想起了我自已的不幸的運命，我想起了我自已漂泊的渺茫前途，我想起了自已的生人！我傷心，我難過，我想哭。那不是快樂的幸運的禮堂，那簡直是一座嚴蕭的悲傷的地獄啊！</p>
<p>可是我没敢哭出來，在這種所謂（喜事）裹面是不容許這種惹人厭憎的哭聲的。我只得將眼涙呑進肚。我終於將要爆發的情感壓止了。</p>
<p>我切實的了解不幸的人只有不幸的，不幸的人要想在幸運的人前得到一些幸運的餘惠都不可能的。</p>
<p>我發誓我不再參加這種幸運的事件。人家的幸運正是我的悲傷啊！</p>
<p>可是，不幸的人就不幸到底嗎？我不信，十萬個不信！</p>

<h3>杭州偶拾</h3>
<p>— 張亦菴</p>
<p>春天，不止是氣候的温度柔和起來，連田野的光綫色彩也絶不强烈，旣不甚明，也不甚晦，晴朗之中帶着糢糊，遠景的顔色像珍珠那様銀灰而有光彩，一切的色調都是淡淡薄薄的；桃花的微紅，菜花的金黃，算是最觸目的了。</p>
<p>在杭州城裹有許多高大的粉牆，在上海是不很看得見的，可是近年這些牆壁上不是塗滿藍白色的標語便是花綠綠的商業廣告，於是我知道杭州不但革命化，而且商業化了。</p>
<p>在市招等東西上廣告圖案式的字逐漸加多，專家的書法逐漸减少，這些廣告圖案式的字也圖案得不高明，於是在游人的眼裹也逐漸覺得可厭了。</p>
<p>名勝地的題壁，似乎比以前减少了。以塗抺牆壁的肉麻詩及（某年某月某日某某人來游）與肉麻標語相比較，則題壁似乎比較不肉麻一點，因爲題壁的東西，雖然肉麻，也許有些兒眞情的流露，不過修詞上或欠功夫罷了；（來游於此）等也許有多少歷史價値，而不肉麻的東西也會偶然發現。這些東西，縱不使你欣賞，有時也會令你發笑。至於肉麻的標語，則只是表現出說大話的民族性。至於汚損名勝牆壁，則題壁與標語，其揆一也。</p>
<p>名勝的地方，似乎少不了呌化子作點綴，尤其是在香節等時期，杭州當然不能例外。</p>
<p>靈隱天竺之間，雲棲的路上，你可以看見許多呌化子的步哨，一路上就是一個殘廢的展覽會，而且他們特别將殘廢的部份可怕地顯露出來以博得游客的哀憐而施與。我不明白一個杭州，何來這許多千奇百怪的殘廢人物。後來聽說有一部份是故意弄成殘廢以圖牟利的，一到香汎，他們便從四鄉趕到杭州來投機。我想這未必盡是眞話，但是又不能不令我相當的相信。游人的興致無論怎様濃厚，但是一遇着這些殘廢步哨便意興索然。給小孩子和外國人來觀光的見了，尤其令我十分不安，杭州市政府對於杭州旣認爲一個名勝區域而處治，何以對於此輩獨不爲之設法安置取締？難道這種點綴是不可少的？</p>
<p>在雲棲的路上，我親看見過一個年輕貌美的女乞丐，衣裳也穿得很整潔，但是伊也排列在乞兒步哨綫裹，毫不愧赮地嚷着。這眞是一個謎。</p>
<p>他們很會利用香客們的迷信心理和游客們的徼倖心理而嚷着種種迎合這種心理的話頭，如（燒一道（讀如大勿丫）香，修一道福）幾乎每個乞兒都這様喊。又如（我陽間裹受難，你陽間裹修福）都能切合迷信者心理之語。</p>
<p>在中國，和尚與名勝似乎又是不可分離的。我們常說和尚們飽食終日，無所事事。其實有許多名勝地方却靠他們來維護修治，倒也未可厚非。給他們一點施與，便當作納名勝的捐稅罷。不過竭他們之所能，似乎還應該有爲一點。</p>
<p>春節裹，在杭州所吃的菜，不論單素，幾乎無所不用其筍。筍，大可以代表杭州。</p>
<p>我現在明白了茶葉裹有一種所謂（旗槍）名稱的意義。在清明前後，茶樹的梢頭開了一片最嫰的葉，枝端尚有一片捲着未開的。（旗）者，指開了的一片，（槍）者指未開的尖捲兒也。</p>
<p>九溪十八㵎有茶亭賣藕粉的，取（九一八）作商標，可謂巧合雙關，投機之至。定價每元兩罐。我曾對他們說，若把一元的價錢改爲九角一分八則更爲一致了。</p>

<h3>時髦病</h3>
<p>— 玄</p>
<p>所謂（時髦病）是矛盾混亂的社會裹常見的一種流行病。（時髦）二字，在這裹並不作通常的（趨時）的解釋，而有（硬要出語驚人）的意義。（時髦病）有好幾種，這裹只說那最普遍的一種。這一種的病象是打倒一切。什麽都是要不得了，但是誰也不配去執行那（打倒一切）的工作。駡倒一切。覺得别人都是不澈底，都是錯誤的；但是他自已跳在雲端裹，永遠不曾脚踏實地走一步，所以他就永遠澈底，永遠不會錯了。</p>
<p>他不屑做平凡的事：看見人家做披荆斬棘探路的工作，他是要冷笑的；他說（只要跳過去就行了，誰耐煩這麽枝枝節節地幹）可是他自已永遠不曾跳給人家看。</p>
<p>他過着小布爾喬亞的生活，但口口聲聲咒駡别人是小布爾喬亞；他在封建思想和封建勢力的包圍中，但他以爲封建思想早就没落了，封建勢力只存半口殘喘，因而假使還有人在那里攻撃封建思想，在他看來，就是時代的落伍者。他是獨往獨來的英雄，他否定客觀的現實！</p>
<p>他嘴裹從不說（我），但他的心裹常有一个大字（我）！他天天嚷着：要光明，要自由！但是他望見了那由黑暗到光明之間的一段半明半暗的路程就害怕了，而且他用美妙的詞令來掩飾了他的害怕。他要自由，可是他不肯爬上那到自由的梯子，因爲他反對平凡的一步一步的爬，他的理想是（飛）！</p>
<p>他的喜悅是：常常有材料給他駡，他因此是一个最勇敢最澈底的（革命者）。但他的悲哀是：（革命）不了解他！</p>
<h3>不動姿勢）</h3>
<p>— 李儵</p>
<p>現在鄉間雷厲風行、抽壯丁，練民團，奉令停止春耕，大家到操場上（立正）（稍息，）研究（不動姿勢。）</p>
<p>據說縣長也將親自下鄉，檢閱誰的（不動姿勢）做得頂好；好的自然有獎，不好的自然有罰。至若愛惜春光，擅自去耕田的，那還了得，貧民便打屁股，有幾個錢的罰洋三十六元。這都不在話下。縣長是好縣長，講得出，做得出，日前視察員出來視察一次，已抓的抓，牽的牽，捉着一大批去了，要是縣長親自出馬，不用說，更有文章可看。</p>
<p>鄉下人到底是（愚民，）愚蠢到不可教訓，空自憂慮春不及耕，夏何以耘，秋將無收，冬拿什麽來藏。殊不知（不動姿勢）自有妙用。咱們的國度，原是（不動姿勢）的國家；日本軍閥打到遼寗，我們（鎭靜，）日本軍閥佔去了吉林黑龍江，我們（鎭靜，）日本軍閥奪取了錦州山海關，我們還是（鎭靜。）由（不抵抗）而（長期抵抗，）由（靜候國聯制裁）而（先内後外）（二十年救國計劃，）莫非（不動姿勢）的各面相。國家還賴（不動姿勢）撑面子，愚民又復何說。</p>
<p>跳舞可以救國，恢復舊道德便能怯敵。大刀到處，機關槍，坦克車，八十生的大砲都立化灰塵。那麽（不動姿勢）訓練有素，當然也可一個（立正）下去，穀也有了，麥也有了，一切都有了。日本兵一眼看到這個（不動姿勢）必定嚇得屁滾尿流，一個個心驚膽戰而死；也許扶桑三島因（不動姿勢）而陸沉，豈不是比（坐鎭）還有效果嗎？</p>
<p>大豆和油倒在碼頭上，能抗上陸的直脚洋鬼子，畫符玩拳便可抵敵八國聯軍，神機莫測的攘外奇策是古已有之的，如今急急忙忙地來練（立正），講究（不動姿勢，）不過是神而明之，集五千年來的大成吧了。</p>
<h3>雨天</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>從早上起，就不停的下着濛濛的細雨，那麽不顧一切地輕輕地下着，眞是有些惱人呢。不，有些悶人的。門前柏油路上，這時候湧着大量的雨水，亮晶晶地向兩旁流去；柏油路畫頭的煤屑路上，一些低窪的地方，這時更添出許多大小不等的水窪子來。</p>
<p>就在這般的細雨下，没有張着雨傘，也没有穿着套鞋，我一個人離開家向煤屑路上走去。</p>
<p>彷彿是一種慣例似的，我每次走過那洗染公司門口時，必然的，得望望那門上的時鐘，然後，把眼睛移到相距不遠的，蹲在路旁煤渣堆上揀煤渣的一小羣男女孩子。看他們那様子，似乎都没有十歲以上的。每人臉上，骯髒而少生氣，穿的衣服，破碎得不成個様子。</p>
<p>他們有的蹲着，有的爬着，爭着拾取煤渣，像一羣翻動着的螞蟻似的，有時，彼此之間會衝突起來，駡，接着就動手打。</p>
<p>這般年紀青青的孩子們，爲了生活，不能到學校裹去讀書，却每天把時間消磨在拾煤渣上，漫駡上，撕打上，夠多麽可憐！</p>
<p>今天，我想該不會再遇見這羣小英雄了吧？儘管我過路的時間與平日相同，但今天是落雨天哪，他們未必會冒雨出來吧？不，我想錯了，當我走到那裹時，他們一羣人、仍然像平常一様，在煤渣堆上做着同様的工作。有幾個人身上的破衣服都澆濕了。（爲了生活，）我自已在想，（自然是顧不得落雨的。我自已不是和他們一様，爲了知活而在雨下奔走嗎？）</p>
<p>雨仍舊不住地下着，我的心，不由地跟着更加黯淡起來“（孩子們，你們天天拾煤渣，究竟要拾到那一天才止呢？）</p>
<p>一轉念，我就覺得自已弄錯了；徒然悲哀，有什麽用處呢？悲哀到死，你也不能對於社會有絲毫貢獻。那，反到顯示出自已的懦弱來。······</p>
<p>（這世界上，受苦的人，畢竟太多了。）最終，我還是反覆地這麽想着，離開一羣小英雄，在濛濛的細雨中，順着煤屑路前進。</p>
<h3>故鄉雜記</h3>
<p>— 穆時英</p>
<p>五掃墓</p>
<p>天没亮，我們就起來了；擔了酒菜，點心，走到船裹的時候，太陽剛出來。那麽可愛的一個早晨，那麽乾凈的一個藍天！天空是那麽地廣闊，只有一朶雲，掛在半空中，混圓的。天邊是一重重的遠山，潑墨畫似的，帶着蒼然的古氣的遠山，就在山背後，那大太陽，那血染似的大太陽出來了。我們的船是在向那邊兒駛去，向那一重重遠山，向那血染似的大太陽。我躺在船頭的甲板上，讓焦黃的太陽光照着我的臉。水聲在我腦袋底下鳴咽着；我聽得見船梢那兒，櫓在櫓軕上滑轉的聲音，像夏夜聽蘇州女人唱情歌似的，那種哀怨得無可奈何的聲音。前面只看得見浮在水面上的柳絲，和伸到水裹來的水車的腿，河岸上的東西是看不到的，因爲河岸比我的視線高，只有躺在河岸底下的斜灘旁的牛脊梁，和微笑着的小野花的俏麗的臉是我的視野内的異味，那麽地幽靜呵！我是在王摩詰的山水畫裹航行着。瞧不見船在動，只覺得船在水面上左一側，右一側的滑子過去。這兒是没有時間和空間的地方；這兒用不到速度，用不到剌激，用不到麻醉，只是香醇的龍井茶似的生活，幽閒地，不知不覺地在歷史中溜了過去。慢慢兒的，一些人老了，便坐在田野裹，在太陽光裹邊抽着烟，再過幾年，就連自個兒也不意識到似地死了。於是再有一些人慢慢兒的長大了起來，像他們的牛，他們的田野，他們草木那麽地，植物似地生活着，一年年過去，便也跟着他們的祖先躺到泥土裹邊，那麽幸福地閉上了眼珠子。躺着，躺着，在都市裹壓縮了的神經細胞組織鬆軟了下來，我所受的教育裹邊的近代文明一點點的溶解了下來，消逝在這幽靜的，古雅的大氣裹邊。我的眼珠子慢慢兒的閉了，接着便睡熟了，没一個夢，也没一些生活的煩慮在我休息着的神經裹閙。這一睡，把我二十二年來的疲倦，悲哀，憂　，野心，全睡掉了，等我醒來時，只覺得自個兒是剛生出來的一個嬰孩，有一個白紙似的心　，一個完好的肢體。我便笑了起來原始人的愉悅呵！全身的骨骼跳動、着，肌肉裹藴蓄着我從來不曾有過的精，血管裹忽然流着强悍的血，便拿着　繩跳到岸上去，把　担套在胸脯上面，俯着身子，腦袋往前衝着，拉着那着船，一步步地踏着石板路往前走去。船夫曲的旋律湧到我嘴邊，不知怎麽的我有了革命者的情緒，一面想着法國大革命和十月革命，一面却不顧一切地往前　想，只覺得前面是光明，是埃甸樂園。拉了五里路的模様，到報國寺那兒，便跳下了船，因爲我是給那座雄踞半空的古刹迷住了。在那蒼然的松林裹邊，那座黃色的，斑駁的廟宇，沉沉地睡着；一個與世無爭，不爲人所知的東西呢！過了報國寺，河流慢慢兒的狹起來，太陽也越加高了，越加强烈了。我的臉紅得盪手；太陽把我皮膚底下的血管澎漲了，澎漲得連襯衫也穿不住，我便撇開了衣襟。</p>
<p>水底的石子一點點的清楚起來，岸旁有了石山，很近的，山坡直伸展到水旁，我們已經到了山谷裹了，水是越來越淺，水底全是那麽圓潤的石子，從石子縫裹長出一顆顆毛葺葺的，神秘的水草來。我掬了把水洗臉，好清凉的水！呌太陽曬裂了的皮膚擦了冷霜似的滋潤起來。再進去一此路，兩岸只見棕色的柴担，到一條斷了的石橋那兒，船不能再走了，我們便全跳上了岸。（未完）</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— ＪＵＬＥＳＲＥＮＡＲＤ作林取譯</p>
<p>這是狗做夢</p>
<p>雷辟克和愛勒絲丁都在燈下埋頭看東西，一個看着報，一個看着學校獎給自已的書；雷辟克家的在做女紅，大哥斐利克斯在火邊烘脚，紅蘿蔔鬚則坐在地上回憶着一些事物。睡在草墊上的皮拉麥（狗名），突然發出一聲低微的鳴鳴。</p>
<p>（不要呌！）雷辟克止住牠說。</p>
<p>皮拉麥更大聲地呌着。（畜生！）雷辟克家的說。</p>
<p>但皮拉麥愈加粗暴地狂吠，把大家都嚇了一跳。雷辟克家的把手捧着胸口。雷辟克對著狗咬牙切齒地怒視着。大哥斐利克斯　駡着。一下子，大家的耳朶都被呌聾了。（還不住嘴，死狗！給我停住罷，混賬東西！）皮拉麥呌得更利害。雷辟克家的給了牠幾記巴掌，雷辟克起初用報紙打牠，隨後用脚踼牠。皮拉麥因爲怕打，伏着身子不住地呌，嘴巴頂着草墊，好像瘋了似的，死命地吠着。雷辟克一家子全都氣極了。大家站起來，狂熱地對付那睡在地上和他們抵抗着的狗。玻窗都震是瑟瑟地響，火爐上的烟筒發出顫慄的聲音，甚至姐克愛勒絲丁也在尖呌着。但紅蘿蔔鬚呢，並没有人吩咐他，他却自已跑出去看看究竟有什麽。也許有一個在外面弄遲了的流浪人，在街上經過，從容向他自已的住所走去。祇要他不爬過牆來偷東西的話。紅蘿蔔鬚由那暗黑的長廊向外面走去、伸長兩臂摸索着大門。他摸到了門閂，便把它很響地抽開來，但他却不開門。</p>
<p>以前他老是冒險跑出門外，打着胡哨，歌唱着，把脚在地上蹴着，盡力使得敵人害怕。現在他却騙起人來了。</p>
<p>當家裹的人以爲他在勇敢地搜索那些隱僻的地方，像一個忠實的看守人一様，在屋子的四週巡視着的時候，他却欺騙他們，躱在門背後不動。</p>
<p>總有一天他會被人識破的，可是好久以來，他的狡計都成功了。總有一天他會被人識破的，可是好久以來，他的狡計都成功了。他所怕的祇是打噴　和咳嗽。他屏息着，倘使他把眼睛抬起，他可以從門上的一個小窗户望見三四顆星子，那澄澈的光輝使他寒慄。</p>
<p>可是進去的時候到了。這把戲是不能做得太久的。否則人家會起疑心。他重又用着他那雙脆弱的手，搖着那笨重的在生了銹的鐵鈎内發出轢聲的門閂，把牠很響地一直推到閂洞的頂底。這様擾嚷着，人家當然以爲他是從外面回來，已經盡了他的責任啦！於是他滿心歡喜地連忙跑去安慰他的家人。</p>
<p>然而，同上次一様，當紅蘿蔔鬚走開後，皮拉麥已經停住不吠了，雷辟克一家子都已靜下來，各人回到至死不變的坐位上去了。雖說並没有人問他什麽，紅蘿蔔鬚依舊成了習慣般的說這：（這是狗做夢。）</p>

<h3>週初洋收解略形繁忙</h3>
<p>昨爲星期一、銀行方面進出比較平時差優、而市塲中情形依然無聲無臭、洋拆較昂三分、計爲六分、早午市相　、劃頭加水則退落七八分、計爲一角五六分、拆票交易、早市五百八十餘萬、午市交易七十餘萬、銀行鈔票進出二百十餘萬、收解消息外票收解銀欵七百三四十萬、洋欵收解七百一二十萬、進倉一百十萬、華商各銀行收欵洋欵一千六百餘萬、進倉八十萬、錢莊洋公單收解四千四百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解八百四十餘萬、各路匯欵收解七八十萬、來源十萬、本街裝出現洋四十萬、洋押欵交易一百八十餘萬、錢莊解現一百餘萬、又本市票據交換所二十四日交換總數、計銀元四百七十九萬五千六百五十五元五角九分、内計銀元二百七十二萬六千九百三十五元二角二分、匯劃銀元二百零六萬八千七百二十元零三角七分、</p>

<p>昨日江南小洋又見上挺、早市爲八百六十五元、午市又好五角、爲八百六十五元五角、交易早市八千角、午市六千五百角、廣東小洋、早市爲七百九十七元五角、午市爲　百九十七元、交易早市九萬角、午市三萬五千角、銅元回縮七百文、爲三百零九千三百文、交易三萬八九千串文</p>
<h3>長期進出昨訉</h3>
<p>昨日長期交割略有進出、甬莊放欵到期轉賬四十餘萬、本街銀錢業新交易做出三十餘萬、存欵　納三四十萬、收回七八十萬、又放欵方面到期而不能收回、對方强求照轉者、厥數甚巨、計有三百餘萬、此外聞息價方面、因拆息近來不昂、故此項長期息價、不能過事高昂、大概較去年十底、減小五角之譜、</p>
<h3>證劵公債軋空之象漸顯</h3>
<p>漲風銳厲···各漲一元二三至八九角昨華商證劵交易所市面頗爲優秀、蓋以前敵戰事勝利、日人且有不欲卽取平津而退長城之說、加以本月份存賬數目尚鉅、環境旣好、引起軋空、套利及多頭掉期者亦不少、上午開盤、漲風卽見甚銳、裁兵驟漲一元三角、北帮需要頗殷、次盤多頭掉期居多、市面稍疲二三角、但亦有數種尚微好一角或五分者、交易則兩盤極爲暢旺、成交竟有八百數十萬之多、午後開盤、四十四號收買最盛、市價由疲轉高、故編遣略疲、裁兵平穩、入後均又漲起四五角、收盤北帮仍有進胃、十一號及三十五號收買爲數較鉅、市價乃</p>
<p>愈抬愈高、故又漲五六角、綜觀全日趨勢、頗爲銳利、實因環境造成軋空、今日本月期爲最後一天、必尚有一番劇烈之競爭也、市價結果、一致上漲、多數在一元二三角至一元八九角、獨一八開祇漲四角五分、編遣祇漲六角、成交總數、計共一千六百二十六萬九千元、内現四千元、期貨統鹽稅共佔六百四十二萬元、裁兵佔二百二十二萬五千元、一九關善佔三百零一萬、廿捲廿關佔三百四十七萬五千元、餘亦數萬至數十萬不等、</p>

<h3>紗花標紗小有曲折</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、因實需較昨爲少、人心稍平、但大户逢跌仍購、市盤尚定、惟商塲傅說紛紜、謂廠方對於三萬包存紗有辦法之說、因之做多做空者皆不安定、總之根本問題、在實需上也、</p>
<h3>人標大勢穩定</h3>
<p>人極前市開盤、市氣極平、二三盤賣户稍增、而跌五六角、收盤大户猛力購進又漲、結果各月漲一二六角、午後聞現銷不多、市氣略疲、各月跌二四六角、全日成交統計三萬八千包、查賣出裕康一千零五十包、明德七百五十包、協生七百五十包、永大一千一百包、義餘一千三百五十包、買進榮興一千三百五十包、立昶一千一百包、愼記八百五十包、穗隆六百包、收盤價如下、人標收盤漲跌存賬數七月一九一一跌四五四、九○○四月一八六五漲四一五、五○○八月一九三三二三九、六五○五月一八八五一四○、七五○九月一九四五三三、七五○六月一八九六跌四四八、七五○總計二三三、三○○</p>

<h3>大户購標花</h3>
<p>棉市趨堅、市氣頗挺、因大户購進、但廠方以減工實行、對於原料絶無進意、兼之海外情形不佳、銀價仍長、外棉採算銀盤未貴、惟本埠多頭購進加碼而昂云、</p>
<h3>鄭標市態鞏固</h3>
<p>鄭標前市開盤、市氣較昂、各月漲一角半、二三盤又漲、各月漲一角半至三角半、午後開盤頗昂、拍至二三盤以多頭了結稍疲、各月漲五分、全日成交統計九萬一千五百担、查賣出同孚六千擔、振大二千担、愼昌二千八百担、源大一萬零五百担、裕康二千二百担、買進立昶五千八百担、餘昶五千八百担、源興昌四千九百担、仁豐二千六百担、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>絲茶海外絲價轉堅</h3>
<p>昨日紐約絲市又現一元四角七分之高價、橫濱亦漲十五元、合七百八十元、本埠絲市因　票轉長、且因週一無海外來　、故交易稀少、計成交者有湖山牌十三·十五十包、價七百二十八元、南潯牌十三·十五二十包、價七百八十二元、照現狀觀察、海牙絲市頗呈穩定狀態、或繼續上漲、亦意中事、惟絲價之漲、每與銀價俱、故上海市價不能與海外絲價同時上昇、且存絲品質參差、泰半不合國外綢廠之用、非俟新繭上市、交易恐不能充分暢逹也、</p>
<h3>江西茶號近况一瞥</h3>
<p>浮梁都難開塲德興續呈停頓</p>
<p>浮屬各鄉茶號、向有六七十家、今歲雖無上年之熱閙、但賃莊設法開塲者、仍屬不少、市面外貌、看似不减往年、但究其實際、大多僅租一幢莊址、資金多寡、尚無準備、其宗旨希冀棧家放匯轉鬆、領得些微茶欵、再賒山價、以資挹注、詎待至現在、新茶將採、棧方對投機之號、仍主緊縮、於是此等無資呌囂之茶號、因領不着棧欵、均陷停車狀態、總計四鄉難開塲之號、約有二十餘家、其他屬於臨時性質者、以銀根如此之竭、開塲更屬夢想、連日景鎭錢莊、因茶票擠買、每千貼水、抬漲至二十元、比之屯溪每千貼水三四元、吃虧殊巨、</p>
<p>德興向爲贛北産茶要區、自十七年方邵赤匪侵入盤踞後、遂無茶市可言、四鄉茶樹、因匪氣不能培壅、半多荒蕪、新茶發育、又不能及時採製、今歲德境匪共、雖無往年之披猖、阨要之區、有國軍駐守、惟地方迭受蹂𨈆、元氣大喪、殷實商户、怵於匪患未除、仍不欲蹈險經營、故本年德邑茶市、依然陷於停頓、無復業之可能、</p>
<h3>糧食河下米續漲角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源三十餘號、零胃仍活、市况帶緊、包胃天津烟台等帮採取青角等薄稻千包、及同里厚粳千包、以故形勢活潑、青角同里南港等米價格漲高角許、杜洋尖亦見帶好、惟變元胃呆跌角砠、陰元無榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源二十餘號、白粳走化淡薄、市形無榮無辱、薄粳到消兩和、價趨定勢、早稻到少消活、價加近尺、秈米平定、陰元變元無甚上落、</p>
<h3>粉麥小俏而已</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份暫呈平穩、以洋麥報價、計美來漲六七角、坎麥漲一元零、開價後似見平穩、外行人心、因國外物價有增高之勢、人心未免轉俏、買氣亦稍轉活、較之前日收價、近遠期似均好一分左右、查洋麥大漲、粉市祇跟起近分、可見國内之物價、目下尚未能同日語也、迨至下午開價、本月份尚見平定、遠期各月份、則各廠又分别抛售、數量雖不甚旺、人心則又引以爲憂、故開價又復步軟、各廠之意、因北方銷路、一時不能大暢、存麥又甚豐厚、所以一遇機會依然套賣不已也、結果四五六月份、較前日好二釐半、七八九月份則無出人、至兵船現貨喊二元四角半、較標準似覺提高、</p>
<p>麥市上下午各月份市面、近平遠穩、以洋麥報價、雖漲六七角至一元外、但因本埠之現貨洋麥、實在豐厚、各廠之麥胃目下似無急切之態、本月份局面因有浮多了結、反小一分、遠期因内地帮略有進意、套户之出擋者未多、似略見佳、惟照現洋麥情形、標準終難繼好也、結果本月份較小一分、七月份大二分、八月份大三分、九月份大一分、</p>
<h3>寗波帮大辦洋米</h3>
<p>採去小絞一萬二千五百包</p>
<p>昨洋米市承數週來之活動、客帮亦有活動之意、昨寗波帮到市問訊、由安利洋行照市價貶之三分、以資遷就、甬帮心思甚貪聯合該地行號大事收買、卽與安利成交小絞米一萬二千五百包、價估七元二角九分、本街亦應酬一號西貢二百包、價仍七元八角、多日未見整票交易、昨有此大帮去化、人心甚佳、後市看好、甬帮暢辦洋米之外、又去江西機晚五百包、客秈邇日客化甚活、昨閩化仍旺、再有甬帮問訊、價乃突漲二角至一角、計開出江西機晚一千八百包、八元三角至七元八角四分、又機早六十二包、七元三角九分、湖南機油三百包、八元五角半、又機紅五百包、七元九角四五分、糙油一百○五包、六元七角七分、客秈邇日活潑後、販户又有活動之意、但尚無實行辦裝、惟囤户貯在漢口之湘贛米、以申化甚旺、昨又由公和祥泰兩船裝到三千包、但均有限價也、</p>
<h3>五金二號白鉛皮湧到劇跌</h3>
<p>二號白鉛皮在上週間因到缺節節增漲、每担價高至四十二元、惟其時茶帮購者甚衆、而兵工廠及天津帮等亦有鉅額添辦、近三四日以來如公和祥新太古諸棧裝到現貨共逹二百餘桶之多、而茶帮則已停購、祇有零星交易、况此貨成本低廉故各同業爭圖脫手、行情疲至三元有奇、每擔竟降至三十八元左右、但就最近各同業心思觀之、恐行情此後殊不易回好、</p>
<h3>純銻跌風可怕</h3>
<p>純鐵昨行情每噸祇有三百十六七元、比前暴跌十三四元、交易仍少、此次跌價原由、因産地存貨太多、而銀根奇緊、以此在湖南之銻商、轉動不易、不得不忍痛放手以維生計、觀於近日洋莊生意不動、兵工廠印字房爐坊交易又鮮、行情一時不易見好、</p>

<h3>奸商論</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>（奸商），惡名也，有被人吐駡的份兒，有站立木籠的機會，大概自有（商）字以來，惟此最爲不吉，然而人心終是不可測度的，願做奸商的正大有人在。這動機、據說不是好奇，是爲利。</p>
<p>（天下熙熙，皆爲利來），說到（利）人誰不眼紅，有利可圖，也何怪趨之像快馬、但（利）與（害）常相因，利之所在，也就害之所至，祗是人類的認識常因（所好）的蒙蔽，未能一依於正則，所以害雖未被發現，却已隨着利同來了。結果貪小利的受大害，貪近利的有遠憂，弄得與目的相左，全在於當初一念之錯。</p>
<p>世事常是矛盾的，而人類也頗少自知之明，推測一般奸商的心理，以爲（國家何有於我哉），但他没有想到做得成奸商還在於有這麽一個支離破碎的國家。</p>
<p>譬如說一元二三丈的布，誰不會賣，他們難道不願多賺幾個錢，而必須經你的手使你沾一點油、這實在不是笨伯或是廉讓的行徑，而有不得不讓你沾一點油的理由，這也無須明明說，辭不了這塊（中華民國）的牌子，這生意還做得成？</p>
<p>再如十元一石的米，敵人願出三倍四倍的價來買，在一二八戰爭時曾有一奸商以此犠牲於陳英士紀念塔下，也决不是有所不慊於金錢或是仰慕（君子國）裹的古風，而也因有不能痛快地開了軍用汽車來直接搬取的緣故，說起來還在於有這麽一塊雖然破碎的牌子，所以奸商還得愛國，一不，維護這一塊生財的招牌。</p>
<p>但愛國愛得太厲害，奸商就不能做，不能賺錢，賺錢賺得太厲害，就會失落招牌，做不成奸商，其間去取，頗費斟酌，兩全之法，莫如永遠維持半亡不亡的狀態，最爲得計，這様，遺金錢與子孫，便不會有附帶一個（亡國奴）頭銜的危險，而奸商也可面團團的世襲下去。</p>
<p>以上是我爲奸商籌劃的妙策。其次我要告訴（ＸＸ除奸團）等一類反對奸商的人，要盡除奸商，須想一個釜底抽薪的妙法，警告函與炸彈是無濟於事的。</p>

<p>顧名思義，旅館原是供流動的旅客居住的，都會裹多着旅客，所以也就最需要旅館；鄉村却只要有茶亭之類，便很夠過路客一時的棲憇，然而事實竟大謬不然，顯然的，現在的旅館，其作用是殊途異轍了，就拿上海的旅館來講吧，爲數有一千二百零八家，這還是兩年前的統計，而今恐更不止此數了，沿着西藏路，大馬路，二馬路，······那大厦崔巍，高聳雲霄的洋房，有幾座不是旅館，飯店？裹面的設備，眞夠齊全精雅，有金光可鑑的銅床，細軟雪白的被帳，近便的自來熱水面盆，極目玲琅的裝飾字畫玩具之屬。更有大菜間，跳舞廳，彈子房，高爾夫球塲。正因爲這麽華貴，於是它的作用也就殊途異轍了。它不是供旅客住的，而是給富有的公子哥兒，少奶小姐們沈醉的所在。那兒要納巨量的租金，花様多着的小賬，普通的旅客只有裹足不前，事實上旅客也是毋須乎那般舒適。</p>
<p>每當黃昏降臨燈紅酒綠的時候，便是一羣羣的人像怒潮似的在那兒湧進退出，那是夜的世界的開端，肉的顫動的境界了。烟霧，酒酣，色香，迷舞：浪蕩，沈淪，堕落，幻滅，充分的暴露出都會的肉慾橫流，世紀末的病態癥結，人生的無聊可憎。</p>
<p>大學生蜜司脫黃幾費策應，才得着蜜司張的金諾，一同去看電影，在電影院裹摸索着一度狂吻後，覺得還有開房間的必要，於是手挽着手，蜜語鶯囀似的飛進旅館之門，便成了那兒潮湧着的員屬。</p>
<p>大小姐撇不開間壁李大的慇懃，糾繞，經過老虎灶邊的一度商量，也就雙雙的偷度旅館之夜，</p>
<p>那兒有賭窟，如果你感到經濟壓迫不堪了，想發天財，不妨將房租飯金一切應付的生活費用，暫時擱置不提，權充釣餌，也可大踏步的踱進那兒，獻一宵手舞足蹈的身手。若是口袋裹一時光了，尚思流連，還可回家捲起衣飾塞進</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>長生庫，再去賡續數霄，即使口袋裹再又光了，那是天命，你母庸理怨任何人，侍者還是在向你嬉笑，討付點心錢，算小賬。</p>
<p>那兒也有鴉片烟座，如果你感到笨伯的神經需要麻醉一下，你不妨也去光顧，有細軟的被褥給你做腰枕，有嬌嫩的美人給你做陪伴，高興的話，你可自已打打泡，否則你只管舉起槍頭，便會有人給你把烟裝好，那時，你絲毫不要膽怯，只管雍容地去抽，保你不會有狗的法警來摀蛋，坐在賬房裹的大腹便便的掌櫃，是你最忠實的保鑣，你不用預先去拜托，他自會保你高枕無憂，絲毫没有意外。</p>
<p>在野的黨派政客，一遇時機天降，感到需要結合同志仁兄作一度嚴密商討，然後才好定下（打倒ＸＸ）（擁護ＸＸ）的標語口號，也常到旅館開幾百幾十幾號房間，舉行小組會議。但，這最要秘密，儀式以簡單爲好，萬一要讀（總理遺囑），也只好像做（耶穌禱告）似的默念，絶不可高聲朗誦。否則說不定要出亂子，請你由天堂似的旅館裹降到地獄似的鐵屋裹去，那時保鑣的掌櫃也只是瞠目而視，走失了他一切的權威。</p>
<p>此外還有大世界神仙世界裹所看不到的奇跡駭聞，那便是張博士競生還未曾進化到那種程度的（性交公演），而且要是尚有乳臭的未成年男女孩做角色，才算是天字第一號的頂乖乖名劇。去年且還演過犬與人交的絶響佳劇，可惜（陽春之曲，和者太寡），而竟消跡，未有所聞矣。</p>
<p>此外是歌女娼妓，嫖客淫棍的湧進退出，以及名剌上印着（謝絶一切應酬，敬却非分之賜），的談相士女的穿來撞去，那是很平庸的老套了，用不着細表也。</p>
<p>這便是大都會的旅館之所以爲旅館，旅館業之所以特别發逹也！漪歟盛哉！此即現社會崩潰之前夕也夫！是爲讚。</p>
<h3>惘然的回憶</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>是兒時，是一個初秋的亢旱下午，中飯却還在（咕，咕，咕，）的煎像藥似的在土灶的柴火上煑着。父親送走了羊角冲張三伯後，眉頭緊鎖着回到廚房裹對母親說：　　（先前我還想催雖催，總不會有大批人馬下鄉的，眼見這様的亢旱荒象不料而竟來了，據張三伯聽來的消息，是說下午準會來我家。你們女人還是帶了孩子逃開一步吧！）</p>
<p>（這不好兒戲啦，是有十來個雄糾糾的荷槍兵勇，說還有什麽騎馬的統帶！在灣裹是打鷄殺鴨，全家弄翻了，孫聖五還被鐵鍊鐐枷起來。連我都想走，你們快先逃吧！父親有些鳴咽了。</p>
<p>母親聽完了，在恐怖的空氣裹把脚步慢移向内房去，我挨着跟上，見她揭起右衣角在拭眼睛，倉皇地檢拾荷妹的尿布連同我的一件夾襖包了起來說：（到你二姐家裹去看毛毛（剛生的嬰孩）去，做客想有飯吃，不會像在家裹喝粥水，跟我來，快來！）</p>
<p>我們走出山門，父親已站在門旁的大石塊上，兩眼瞪着遼望灣裹那方的來路。</p>
<p>（好歹今晚把訊息給你們！）父親轉動了一下眼睛說：（好，我們就逃開一步吧！你自已也得留意，頭一莫冲犯了他們，他們到底來頭大，是替國家催軍餉的呢！）你自已母親一再的叮囑：（去，去，到二姐家裹去！）我拉母親的衣角跳着，那是毫不懂人事的狂跳。到了田隴的大路上，我指着一坵結實的稻子問：（媽，爲什麽我們的稻子都乾死了，這兒還有一坵好的呢？）（這是隴田，有水，你不知道我們的全是　田？看有那處的　田不乾得像火箭一？様眞是天意呵！）母親一邊走，一邊解說，精神顯得十分的焦灼。當時我不大理會得透母親講的道理，尤其是（天意）這様的語句，簡直使我聽了像（丈二和尚摸不着頭）一般。</p>
<p>前面的山　上忽然湧現出一羣人馬，我想追近去望望，母親厲聲地駡我，撅了我的耳根避走遠遠的一條小徑，我没有望得十分清楚。但她總是頻頻的偷看那羣人馬的去路，就是我們剛剛走過的來路，於是她的脚步慢了，却有時跌碰着路石。</p>
<p>過了　，是個二三十來度的　，路旁的田禾，全像火箭一様紅，西沈的太陽曬得我們連氣都透不轉來。</p>
<p>母親正和二姐在床沿上咭魯着什麽，我在吃二姐給我的米糕，二姐的廚屋裹剛才在生火。大哥忽然走來了，急喘喘的說：（媽，媽，回去，父親被他們捉去了，家裹已弄得天翻地覆。）於是我們又急怱的回去，母親雖然已整天没有吃東西，却比來時走得格外快，二姐給她的四個熟鷄蛋，她也盡塞在我的袋裹，這時葆妹是大哥抱着先走了。</p>
<p>到了家，三隻鷄，二隻鴨，一隻小猪都不見了，全家呈現着凌亂不堪，只有中餐的粥還在（咕，咕，咕，）的像煎藥似的在土灶的柴火上煑着。</p>
<p>這是我兒時的一段回憶，想把它丢開，它却越纒繞得緊，我每次回憶起，便是一陣惘然。</p>
<h3>上海底面孔</h3>
<p>— 戈郎</p>
<p>（小土嫂到上海後，聽說紗廠裹做得不到二年，已躍陞做（那摩温），現下的工錢有三十多塊一月。小土眞好福氣，現在好靠老婆吃飯，前天也跑到上海去了。）隔壁的王麻爹對他女人嘖嘖稱羡地說。</p>
<p>（上海畢竟不同鄉下，賺錢賺得來。你想：三十多塊錢，鄉下做姆媽（傭婦）要做一年咧！）王四嬸手裹縫着鞋面也表示羨慕地答應着。</p>
<p>原來王麻爹和王四嬸都没有看到（上海底面孔）。如果看到了，决唱不出這様的讚美詩來。</p>
<p>我可以賭咒說，這次小土到上海來，確實没有靠老婆吃飯的念頭，不過找一個較好的職業的想像却乎有的。</p>
<p>然而理想畢竟不合事實。小土跑到上海，整整的兜了二個月圈子，職業仍然没有找着。糶去的五石穀錢廿五塊老洋倒用得精光了！回家不得，只好在老婆處挨簷頭，　着燒飯，洗碗打水······當然，小土嫂對他的（不景氣）是不成問題的。</p>
<p>五點鐘敲過了，大色還没有發白光。小土起來，把炭爐子扇紅，燒好飯，去打開水，然後伏在枕頭邊輕輕喚醒女人。</p>
<p>她一起來，把高跟皮鞋擦了五分鐘，再來洗臉，搽上雪花膏，對二次鏡，拿起碗筷草草划了幾口，披上斗篷大衣準備進廠。</p>
<p>（外邊天色不好·傘阿要拿去？）小王抺着桌子屏氣靜聲地說。（人又没有死過！不好送到廠裹來呀？）她說着把門（碰的）一帶顧着自已走了。</p>
<p>眞的！小土嫂的面孔，從入世到如今，統計起來確已有過四副不同的模様。第一副大家都没有見到，因爲她没有來上海；第二副就是剛才拍給小土看踩；至子第三，第四，當然要以紗廠來做她的背景了。</p>
<p>（徐先生！我來了。今天有啥吩咐没有？嘻嘻！）小土嫂的皮鞋聲咯）（咯）嚮進了辦公室在簽字簿上劃了個押，走近考工先生面前微笑地請了一個（早安）。</p>
<p>（看着她們不使偷懶！做壞布這幾個的名字把她記起來。不聽話的儘管拿捧頭打！其餘的話儂都心裹明白不用多說。）徐領班從莊嚴的腔調中低轉聲來也報答了一個微笑。</p>
<p>小土嫂跨進了布機間的門檻，馬上就把斗篷大衣脫去，露出緋紅華絲葛的旗袍，亮晶晶的長通絲襪，在八九十個女工當中，她確實可以算得（雞羣獨鶴）的了。她開口第一聲說：　　（大家留心！近來的生活越做越壤了！要是這様下去，工錢一概不發，看你們怎様活命？不是我那摩温良心狠，你們自已不爭氣有什麽法子呢？）她說時臉上好像現着（七十烏）的神氣。接着又說：</p>
<p>（王小妹，李翠娥跑過來！你二只小猪　最壤：一天到晚同人家打碰，生活不管，今天破布，明天斷頭，都是你二只小猪　做的！）她說了後，把兩個童工的耳朶扯了幾下命其回去。</p>
<p>布機間的馬逹聲（隆隆隆）的發嚮了，大家都纔着頭顧自已牽經勾緯。小土嫂的第五副面孔倒底是什麽模様誰也未曾去注意到。不過有人說，小土嫂的面孔本來只有一副，其餘三副是上海塑型給她鑄成的，如果她自已看到時，也一定會否認。所以只可說這是（上海底面孔）！我聽到這話不覺也爲點頭。連說（對！對！）</p>

<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3>夫婦之道苦矣</h3>
<p>編者先生：我有一個困難問題，時常徘徊於我的腦海，而不能解决。遇到極度（沉悶）（抑爵）的時候，甚至有自殺的動機。現在雖極力的（奮鬥）（掙扎），仍没有找到圓滿的辦法。每閱</p>
<p>貴報店員通訊欄，爲人解答了不少的難題，而且狠透澈的指點。現在我這個難題，亦懇請</p>
<p>先生指示解答，是萬分感謝的。我是一個被人恥笑而輕視的（雄媳婦）。不幸的我，三歲死了父親，十四歲又死了母親，上無兄姊，下無弟妹，一個狠可憐的孤兒。幸而還有一個嫡親的叔父，送到距離故鄉三十餘里的鄉鎭上一爿小雜貨店裹學生意。因爲知道自已身世的痛苦，狠克苦耐勞的作事，狠得業師的重視。到了十七歲的那年，業師有家親戚死了一個獨子。承業師的美意，介紹我入贅給那家親戚。當初我略知些人事，對於這種更名改姓的（雄媳婦），有些不願意，經了旁的的甘言，回顧家境的貧寒，就此允了這終身遺恨。當初我的叔父和嬸娘狠不贊成這件事，見我意志已决定，遂順我去進行。我的理想，欲借助他人，以圖日後的發展，姓名本是人生的符號，没有什麽關係的。那裹知道與我的理想完全相反。自入贅了後，没幾年，岳氏即托親戚謀就本埠一家國貨工廠裹當個小職員，自從進廠之後，汗血所換來的薪水，按月要寄給岳氏三分之二，我誤認爲這是她們的好意，恐怕我浪費，代替我積蓄，故而不與她們計較，按月的寄去。可是不幸叔父的兒子在去年死了，叔父和嬸娘靠兒子活命的來源没有了，二老年事已高，日後的生活怎様維持呢？我爲良心驅使，見了叔父和嬸娘這種苦况，當然由省吃儉用中貼補些。這事爲岳氏知道了我的（雌丈夫）趕到上海，大興問罪之師，聲言非將所賺的月薪如數給她們不可，否則不許我在上海服務，我的苦衷，她們一些不肯願諒，並且因錢不寄去月月的來吵閙，我實在忍無可忍，同她們反抗了數次。這様一來，惡感日深，對於夫婦的情感完全破裂。一個人，到了這種地步，還有什麽樂趣，每感及此，態度時趨消極，欲自暴自棄以了終身，或一死了之。但是這兩條路，對於岳氏方面不成問題，因爲我已經有了子女各一，且岳家略有簿産，可能維持生活。但對於年高的叔父和嬸娘怎様辦法呢？奮鬥又不能，消極不好。所受精神上的痛苦和經濟的壓迫，差不多逹到極點，這様的下去都是促短我壽命的利刃。請問</p>
<p>先生怎様可能脫離這萬惡的家庭，恢復我的自由，解除我的痛苦，並使年老的叔父嬸娘不受凍餓的苦楚。懇賜指示。敬祝撰安余悔初謹上四月二十二日</p>
<p>編者按：結婚的眞諦，在謀男女兩方的合作。所以男女兩方，必須要有互相尊崇，互相協助的精神。男的視女的爲私有物，任意支配，當然不可：但是女的視男的爲私有物，任意侮辱，也是不行的。所以我們以爲夫婦的結合，根本談不到（誰嫁給誰。）他們不過因爲彼此戀愛，進而營共生活罷了。丈夫對於妻黨，當然要有其相當禮貌；妻子對於丈夫的親族，也要有相當的禮貌。現在余君妻黨的觀念，無非以爲余君自他們的人了，他的一切？應該全部受他們的支配；對於余君的親族，最好斷絶交往，方稱他們的心意。現在你非但不能體貼入微他們這種意思，反而將金錢去津貼叔父，在他們看來，眞是大逆不道了。這様看來，余君的妻黨，簡直不明給婚的眞諦；這様的夫婦，夫婦之道苦矣。所以我們贊成余君的態度。你對於從小照顧你的叔父叔母，在他們悽慘的晚年，憑良心是應當貼助他們的。你對付妻黨的手段，也不必一定要與他辦怎麽交涉，你祇須拿定志意，我行我是，結他們一個不睬不理罷了。你最好想法子離開你現在岳家薦你的事情。他們旣經定要招婿在前，不言可知，他們是很看重宗祧的；日了一久，你的妻子，旣不能改嫁，爲了宗祧關係，怕不會來遷就你嗎？</p>

<h3>夢裹光陰（三十六續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>這還是些不出息的咧有出息的中國人便不是這様做了！（倒霉；今天眞倒霉！累了一天，祇得了這麽一堆銅板角子，連大洋票也没有一張！）掛着ＸＸ省義勇軍後援會募捐隊隊員底徽章的老張，在家裹劈開了今天他背了一天的毛竹筒，很失望地向他老婆這様嗟嘆着。（······一二八以來，吾人當知飛機之重要矣，······加入本會基本會員，納年費十元，普通納年費二元，入會時奉送徽章，每月贈閱出版物。······會員不限國藉，······）因爲私用公欵，以致聲名浪藉的教良界紅人Ｘ博士，忽然異想天開的發起了一個（飛機救國協會），以徽章做號召，學着東新橋畔的姑娘們底手腕，東拉西　，倒也弄到了不少的會員；飛機大概必須待中華民國亡了國之後再買，可是會長的汽車，倒先辦就了。</p>
<p>於是，從九一八起，社會上除掉舊有的三百六十行之外，又添了一項新興事業救國。究竟ＸＸ會，ＸＸ會，一起有多少救國的團體？天知道！（民氣如是，國可救矣！）一般思想落伍，頭腦又比較簡單些的上了年紀的老人，看了這様五花八門的景象，眞有些眼花了，以爲救國運動旣如些熱烈，中國大概總是亡不掉的了，不禁暗暗欣慰着，伍逸也是其中的一個。伍源的出走，使他像酣睡似的在鼓樓醫院裹昏迷了三四個月，心靈上受到了一次最劇烈的剌激，簡直比三十年前，他母親爲着他底堕落而生生地氣死的一幕更痛苦，他差不多已失却了繼續生存的勇氣了，但是，他兒子在出走之後，偏又寫了一封信給Ｘ大的學生會，輕輕地把放走王國楝的責任，打他父親身上卸到了自已身上來，因此Ｘ大的學生依舊很熱地擁護着他，而他的令高足！Ｘ部長也並不曾批准他的辭呈。爲的是没人高興掮這根濕木梢待他一出醫院，雙方便同時趕來速駕，要求他即日回任。</p>
<p>雖然勸駕者底態度都是十分誠懇而熱烈，可是他本人已絶對不願回校，所謂　　在我身上。任你怎様勸法，走不走總要我做主，學生們也就無法可想；後來，部裹旣不派人來繼任，校裹的公文上，也還依舊沿用（伍逸）的名字，無形中又恢復了他底傀儡生活。</p>
<p>（以後的光陰，我將完全把牠支配在無代價底救國工作上，不然，我怎様對得起我的兒子呢）？伍逸老涙縱橫的向他夫人這様懺悔着，其時，伍源的消息已隔絶了一個多月了。</p>

<h3>好萊塢快要總崩潰了</h3>
<p>— 思頻</p>
<p>袞袞明星相率他去</p>
<p>氣數將盡莫可挽回</p>
<p>世界經濟蕭條的怒潮把好萊塢捲入漩渦之後，世界電影事業的大本營早已發生了動搖。現在的情勢可更加每况愈下，許多著名的男女明星紛紛星期，好萊塢大有由動搖而至崩潰的恐慌，電影明星大多數過的是奢侈生活，好萊塢閙了減薪風潮之後，電影演員，以前失業的失業，不失業的現在也感到入不敷出的窮苦，尤其是著名的明星最感着失去的黃金時代的悲哀。</p>
<p>從前電影事業盛極一時的時期，許多舞台人物相率離棄舞台生活而改入電影生活。在現今這個年頭，他們唯一的出路便逃不了原回老家，於是有許多明星紛紛歐洲去。貴族式的美麗女明星瑙瑪希拉和海倫絲夫婦均已定了艙位，預備到歐洲住幾個月，風流小生雷門諾伐羅早已於三月二十四日到巴黎表演歌唱。新出名的克拉克蓋勃爾也預備請假赴歐，他對人表示，如其不能到歐洲，至少也要遠離悽凉寂寞的好萊塢而入出打獵，曼麗黛特里許在拍完她所主演的影片之後，便同了她的丈夫和愛女回到柏林居住，爲期久暫現在還没有眉目。葛里古柏現在正與瓊克勞馥合演一片，演完之後，可有三個月的假期，也預備在假期裹到歐洲去。琪恩哈士郝特也預備在攝完影片之後到丹麥，再到德國單獨登台表演，丹那威爾特預備在英國休息六個月。</p>
<p>好萊塢幾個有點名聲的男女明星差不多快要跑完了，其餘明星之中將要赴歐，或者早已動身的，還有希佛萊，范朋克，瑪麗畢克馥，康斯頓斯彭納德，史黃生，克洛夫白樂克，查利賴甫頓，瑪克瑞和赫柏特馬雪等等，這様看來，好萊塢不是快要總崩潰嗎？</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評（神秘騎俠）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ＴＨＥＭＹＳＴＥＲＲＯＵＳＴＩＤＥＲ看過本片之後，我覺得頗滿意的，便是演出的技巧。雖然主角ＫＥＮＴＡＹＬＯＲ的武藝的表演，並不曾將我們想像中的（俠客）的姿能更好的表現出來，同時其餘的主要演員，也不見如何生動，可是攝影，收音，　及導演的任用鏡頭，都是値得我們相當滿　的。而且導演對於全劇的進展，亦　很好的注意。</p>
<p>但是本劇的故事，却是怎様結構的呢？因爲影片决不是僅僅給人們娛樂而已，每一個影片，必然的會在我們腦筋中留下多少印象，甚至於會影響到我們對於人生的概念與現實的觀察。所以，關於本片的意識·必須有以說明。</p>
<p>爲了便於明瞭起見，先將本片的故事，大概的加以介紹。</p>
<p>尼華逹山谷中的農民，因築堤而影響到收穫和地價的增高，都很喜歡。但因礙於法律而不能不從某律師手中購買原有土地。不料狡滑的律師，却將此土地再出賣給富翁，以致引起農民和官廳間的爭鬥。結果由一騎俠揭破律師的黑幕，而得太平無事。</p>
<p>本來以農村中的爭鬥爲題材，倒是在美國片中比較新頴的。但在編製電影劇本的時候，却每每是不合理的發展下去，很顯明的，他們將律師的罪惡作爲劇的焦點，而有意忽視與移轉這種爭鬥的中心。固然法律常被某種聰明而有權勢的人們所利用，而作爲壓迫或剝削的工具，這一點正於本劇中不知不覺的暴露出來，可是（合法）的解釋，畢竟是本劇最主要的結論。所以導演爲了必須如此，乃將高潮的正面衝突都在暗塲中模糊過去，雖然這些鏡頭都很美麗。同時（英雄與美人）的穿插，固然是資本主義的影片中必要的條件，但是在這裹使觀衆沉醉於（愛）的酒精中，而忽視這種爭鬥的發展，也是非常有效的。</p>
<p>至於結構的本身，也有不少毛病，但是我認爲那都非主要點，所以從略。</p>
<h3>華南的電影明星譯名</h3>
<p>— 友德</p>
<p>電影明星的中文譯名，在我國是没有一定標準的，本埠的電影明星的中文譯名和香港廣州的中文譯名因語言尖重和尾音的關係，不同得有趣，如武俠明星范朋克在彼方譯爲菲賓氏，電影皇帝却爾福電譯爲查理士花奴，牢獄鴛鴦主角吉士馬立司譯爲車士打摩理士，神童賈克古柏譯爲　奇谷巴，琵絲拉芙譯爲卑詩羅富，雷門諾伐羅譯爲理文李花奴，冷面滑稽裴斯開登譯爲伯七逹傑頓，珍妮蓋諾譯爲珍納姬娜，腦門希拉譯爲娜媽絲拉等等，苟不閱英文原名，眞如墜五里霧中，這是嗜好電影的人們，應當注意的一種常識。</p>
<h3>（春蠶）將上銀幕</h3>
<p>— 野</p>
<p>中國文壇健將即沈雁冰之短篇小說（春蠶），現應明星公司之請，改編爲脚本，預備攝爲電影，並聞内容經沈君親加增删與佈置後，較前已更爲精彩。</p>
<p>（春蠶）所描寫之對象，係中國農村急劇破産中小自耕農工之崩潰，與地主及高利貸借之剝削，以一老農夫爲主角，叙述其壯年時代之自給自足他的黃金時代，及逐漸衰落之情况，而至於今日完全破産。佈置緊凑，描寫亦甚深刻云。</p>
<h3>爲美容而犠牲</h3>
<p>— 宗</p>
<p>朱秋痕忍痛拔牙</p>
<p>在荷萊塢的電影領域裹，關於明星們爲美容而犠牲的事情，可以說時有所聞，那麽我們中國的上海電影區域裹呢？這種事情實在是很少發見，可是在本年度的本月裹，中國電影明星也實行了爲美容而犠牲的事了：</p>
<p>記得去年，明星公司的艾霞女士，她因爲自已覺得眼睛太細，對於表演方面很吃虧，所以想上科學美容院去割一割，但是未經朋友證明醫師之技術高低，所以没有去實行。</p>
<p>今年實行的有兩位明星，一位是天一公司的王慧娟女士，她因爲臉上長了許多黑痣，對於容顔美上，實在大有損害，所以上科學美容院去診治，結果去黑痣而變爲白麻！她現在還嬌嗔着怨恨那位美國醫生呢！</p>
<p>前天朱秋痕女士，她因爲受了張石川老板的命令，跑到霞飛路一家牙醫館去拔牙，我問她爲甚麽把好好的天然牙齒拔掉？她說：（前程）一片，我飾一蕩女，蕩女要美，而我這副牙齒，實在不美觀。石川先生呌我改造兩扇大門，我索性把東便門西便門一起取消了！）一位很能說笑的姑娘，張着一張没有牙的嘴說話，這是爲甚麽呢？想想可憐！她不過要使得合於銀幕上的美人，博得在藝術上有升一步進展就是了。她和我話别的時候，臉上確已顯然地露了她的疼痛，回頭把一方手帕，按住她底嘴唇，微微地一笑······去了！</p>
<h3>日本的電影屑談</h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>日本的電影公司甚多，其中以松竹映畫株式會社資格最老，牠有二所攝影塲：一所是在東京郊外的蒲田，還有一所是在京都的下加茂。前者專攝現代片，而後者是專攝時代片即古時片的。</p>
<p>日本的影片公司大概都攝時代片的。因爲在日本時代片和現代片同様有號召力的。除去不二，入江，兩公司因係現代片明星所織成外，其他各公司都有時代片的出品。每年總有一個公司，攝這有名的時代片（忠臣藏）（描寫諸候之臣爲其主報仇之故事）最奇怪的就是，當每一次這時代片上映時，看客總是擁擠不堪的：加之，日本的電影館對於售票没有限制的原故，觀衆有坐的，有立的，眞是有人山人海之概。</p>
<p>日本的演員亦是分時代與現代兩部份的。雖然有時兩方面都可以借用，但是在大體上，演時代片的終是專門演這類影片的。這大概是因爲觀衆對於時代片演員的載着假髮的面孔看慣了，再看他們的眞面目有點不自然吧！</p>
<p>近來日本的影片公司招募女演員的方法是這様的：在一個大都市裹，登廣告收集貌美而願爲女演員的照片；他們從裹面擇出最適當者數十名，再請該地的民衆選舉；選舉出來的就能被稱爲密絲△△。如該地是東京，就被稱爲密絲東京。這種女演員不用宣傅已經名氣很大了。</p>
<p>默片在日本雖堪稱發逹，但有聲片還不過在試騐時期。</p>
<p>最後讓我告訴你們，日人呌導演爲監督，男演員爲排優，女演員爲女優。</p>

<h3>電影小說忠魂錄ＣＡＶＡＬＣＡＤＥ（七）</h3>
<p>— 訥</p>
<p>愛德華將她摟在懹中，安慰著她，告訴她總不會離開她的。但她仍舊嘮嘮叨叨地說箇不休，總以爲這種十全十美的好夢，是不會永久的。愛德華有些急了，他說：（親愛的，你至少可以看看父親和母親，他們不是始終相愛，（總不分離的嗎？）藹蒂絲說：（他們所處的時代，和我們所處的時代不同。我們所處的時代，變幻昨太快了。生命是這様的不安穩）！愛德華望著藹蒂絲的臉笑問道：（那末，你到底給我們多少候活著呢？一個鏡頭嗎）？（我不知道），他忽然臉對著他。（我不管！這就是我們的良辰，美麗的，完全無缺的！我一些亦不怕，這是我們的，永遠是我們的）！奇怪的很，這幾句話就是他們新婚夫婦最後的永訣，因爲在這當兒，就是那歷史上有名的泰坦尼克輪船被氷山撞沉，千餘人同時遭難的時候。藹蒂絲說完了幾句話，船身被氷山一震，好似天崩地拆似的，她倒在愛德華的懹裹。一時船上人聲鼎沸，他們二人再没有時間可以談什麽話，亦没有工夫去想做什麽事，僅知互相緊緊地抱持著。靜聽著船上的樂隊，吹著（近乎天上我父）悲慘的音調。一回兒黑暗籠罩了他們，他們以愛始，亦以愛終，但是嘗到愛的滋味還不久！</p>
<p>泰坦尼克沉没的消息傅到倫敦，琪茵和瑪格雷悲慟得一言不發，互相緊緊地抱持著。廻想當年愛德華，藹蒂絲一班小孩子青梅竹馬的時候，猶如隔日，而如今祇有喬易一人存在，爲父母者之心，亦可云傷心到極點了。又過了多少時候，他們綫能重開笑臉，重新一塊兒喝茶，重新能提起愛德華和藹蒂絲二人的名字而不至於流涙。但是天不估人，卽此區區平安歲月，亦不能稍爲延長時日。這時歐洲已風雲緊急，英國風傅著已將向德奥宣戰。那時羅伯琪茵等正在德國游歷得了不穩的消息，慌忙出境，狼狽不堪。等到到了倫敦家中，英國政府已經向德奥宣戰了。</p>
<p>喬易廻想數日以前，還在德國各處游歴，交了不少朋友。他聽見了英德已經宣戰兩國的健兒，不久，就要在疆塲上，互相殘殺。他問他父親道：（我是很喜歡德國人的，你覺得怎様）？</p>
<p>（當然），羅伯說，（我亦很喜歡他們的）。但是這兩國打仗的問題，他們就此不再討論了。（未完）</p>

The military circles in Beiping all laughed at the Tokyo Japanese news claiming that half of the Hua army had been lost, while only twenty-one Japanese soldiers had died, saying that such a large massacre on such a short front was not something that human power could achieve.

<h3>The Puppet Central Bureau's Vicious Resolutions</h3>
<p>The National Army Has Been Actively Suppressing Them</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain military agency in the capital received a telegram from the Central Route Army Commander Chen on the 21st, reporting on the recent resolutions of the puppet Central Bureau. The original telegram is as follows: The puppet Central Bureau recently resolved: (1) To create a million-strong Red Army of iron in all Soviet areas in China to fight against imperialism and the Kuomintang army. The two provinces of Gan and Min must send 10,000 new soldiers to the front within one month. (2) To call on the working class, peasants, and toiling masses to join the Red Guards with weapons. The Pioneers are preparing to change from a voluntary service system to a compulsory service system. (3) Independent regiments and guerrilla teams should actively attack, harass the enemy, and destroy communications in the rear, especially in the border areas of southern Jiangxi and western Fujian, to carry out the most effective campaign to resist the enemy. (4) To use all forces to transform the Anti-Imperialist and Soviet Union Alliance into a massive workers' and peasants' organization against imperialism. (5) To borrow 200,000 piculs of grain, plus land tax public bonds for the revolutionary war, to be paid on the prescribed date. The workers, peasants, and civilians should save one copper coin each day (to purchase aircraft and military equipment, mobilize women, and make 50,000 pairs of straw sandals and 50,000 pairs of shoes to transport to the front). (6) To advance the spring plowing, complete the land survey, and thoroughly resolve the land issue. Land survey or land distribution shock brigades will be mobilized on a large scale. (7) The provincial committees of Gan and Min should make their greatest efforts to strengthen the leaders of the newly developed areas, including Ningdu, Guangchang, Yihuang, Le'an, Nanfeng, Lichuan, and Shicheng in Jiangxi, and Jianning, Taining, Ninghua, Liancheng, Guihua, and Qingliu in Fujian. (8) The party in the combat areas or areas near the combat zones should lead the local political and mass organizations to establish a battlefield committee, responsible for clearing the land, treating wounded soldiers, and allowing the main forces to move to the battlefield and continue to eliminate the enemy without concern or damage. The Red bandits are using extremely vicious means. The National Army is actively suppressing them. (24th Central Telegram)</p>
<h3>Kailuan Mining Engineer Wallingken Conflicts with Japanese Officer</h3>

A verbal conflict ensued. It is rumored that the Japanese man was injured in the lower part of his body by Wallingken. One account says he has died. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>General Headquarters Orders the Militia to Change to a Conscription System</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The General Headquarters issued an order to all counties to organize local defense forces to defend their areas. However, these militiamen are mostly hired by local gentry and merchants at their own expense, and have very little sense of responsibility. In order to implement universal military training, a request was sent to the Ministry of Interior yesterday to change the militia system in all provinces to a conscription system, with a view to realizing a national army as soon as possible to strengthen national defense. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army's Western Shift in Eastern Luan is Intended to Attack Miyun from the Flank</h3>
<p>A Certain Important Person in Beiping Issues a Responsible Statement</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person issued a responsible statement, saying that the Japanese side is propagating that our army is putting pressure on them and challenging them, intending to use this as an excuse to launch an attack and carry out more wanton aggression. Fabricating facts and confusing public opinion is a habitual trick of the Japanese. Recently, the Japanese army has launched a fierce attack on us from Gubeikou, intending to occupy Miyun and Yutian first, and then attempt to attack Beiping, as a foundation for their entire aggression in North China. Furthermore, the Japanese troops in Eastern Luan, Xifengkou, and other places have been moved west as much as possible. Outwardly, they are propagating a withdrawal, indicating that they will no longer attack, in order to mislead international opinion. In reality, they have moved to Xinglong, thinking of going straight to Miyun from there and attacking our flanks in order to achieve their goals. Our army is determined to fight to the death. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chen Lifu Reports on His Impressions of Inspecting Party Affairs in the North</h3>
<p>At the Central Party Headquarters' Memorial Week</p>
<p>Discussing Organization, Propaganda, and People's Movement in Detail</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Party Headquarters held its 75th Memorial Week at 8 AM on the morning of the 24th. Over six hundred people attended, including Ju Zheng, Li Liejun, Wang Qi, Huang Jichen, Xie Zuomin, Zheng Zhannan, Ye Chucang, Hong Ludong, Chen Lifu, Chen Guofu, and staff. Chairman Ju Zheng presided, and Chen Lifu reported on his impressions of inspecting party affairs in the North, discussing it from the aspects of organization, propaganda, people's movement, and education, and listing its advantages and disadvantages. The main points were: (1) Organization: Our party is the only organized group in China. Only with organization can there be a demonstration of strength. The basic conditions for organization are the four categories of gravity, motivation, morality, and discipline. The needs of purpose and environment are fundamental to the existence of organization. Without these two, one cannot speak of organization, and there is no way to demonstrate strength. At present, all lower-level party headquarters are not clear about this. This should be the goal of efforts in the future. (2) Propaganda: In the past, propaganda methods only paid attention to the purpose but lacked steps, so sometimes it was exhausted. It is easier to be effective to pay attention before the event than to remedy it afterward. In the future, our propaganda methods should be clear about shame and integrity, and should follow this example to advance. (3) The people's movement should focus on developing the nation's self-confidence, the people's organizational power, and the various forces of material productivity, in order to have practical effectiveness. (4) Education should have the following points: (1) Develop empathy. (2) Focus on practical science. (3) Give play to creativity. (4) Cultivate a spirit of hard work. (5) Change low and improper desires. (6) Suit the needs of society, strive for improvement, and pay attention to its timeliness and spatiality. To realize the Premier's (catch up head-on), one must pay attention to all natural sciences, and one must start from primary and secondary schools. It must be known that without education, the party has no methods, and the country has no methods. Therefore, we should do our best to seek reform. The meeting adjourned immediately after the speech. It was already 10:30 AM. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Verification Required at the Border for Russian Goods Transported by Puppet Organizations</h3>
<p>(Harbin) In the future, in addition to the normal inspection by the (Manchukuo) customs at Suifenhe for goods transported to Russia, the border police must verify them. If the verification is correct, a license will be issued allowing them to be transported to Russia or Vladivostok and then transshipped to other countries. In order to prevent smuggling, a special investigation office will be established east of Suifenhe, organized by customs personnel and border police. All goods and vehicles must be verified here to see if they are consistent with the license issued by the Suifenhe border. This procedure only applies to goods transported out of (Manchukuo), because the Chinese Eastern Railway is currently not transporting Russian goods from Manzhouli to the Maritime Province via Suifenhe. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The (Manchukuo) government authorities are now planning to establish customs offices along the border, paying particular attention to the areas along the Great Wall. The Great Wall has a total of forty-three passes. Goods entering and leaving have never been subject to taxation. The (Manchukuo) authorities are currently considering establishing customs offices at those passes. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>South Manchuria Railway Annexes Implement Opium Public Sales</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Shenyang said that the South Manchuria Railway Annexes implemented an opium public sales system. On the 13th of this month, the Japanese Ministry of Colonial Affairs decided to send the head of the Hygiene Section of the Kanto Agency, Yamaguchi, to Changchun to continue negotiations with the puppet state. On the 24th, a strict order was issued for the announcement. At the same time, opium treatment centers will be set up in five places: Andong, Changchun, Shenyang, Gongzhuling, and Tieling. At present, there are about 20,000 addicts in the annexes. Calculating the daily amount of opium smoked by each person at one qian, they need 125 jin of opium per day, which amounts to several million yuan per year. This is a major source of income for the Kanto Agency. It will be implemented in late May. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The General Staff Headquarters Plans to Eliminate the Xinjiang Incident</h3>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Significance of the United States Abandoning the Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Although the doctrine of socialism is still hated by capitalist countries, the embryonic form of socialism has permeated the international capitalist system. Why do I say this? The main form of capitalism is the private ownership of production capital, and the development of private ownership of production capital depends on the establishment of creditor-debtor relationships and the subsequent expansion of the credit system. The surplus labor exploited by the bourgeoisie is accumulated into claims and transformed into production capital. It then uses the claims to extract interest and uses the generated production capital to carry out further exploitation. It grows day and night and becomes the extremely powerful capital force of today. Therefore, claims are a ladder for the generation of production capital on one hand and form the elements of financial capital on the other. This is why claims are compiled into a special section in the capitalist code, and the work of administration and justice is half in maintaining the dignity of claims. Failure to repay debt results in being disgraced in the village at worst and humiliated in prison at best. This is the only way to maintain the authority of the bourgeoisie. But what about today? The Soviet Union's declaration that international claims from the Tsarist era were invalid was met with worldwide outcry and considered treason. How long did it take before war debt defaulting began among European powers? The scope of defaulting even extended to debts signed by themselves, which is more drastic than the Soviet Union. Thus, treaties, credit, and creditor-debtor relations have been swept away in international relations. The impact of this observation and the general trend will likely spread to social relations.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the accumulation of any property reaches the highest stage and is concentrated in a few people, it will inevitably be exhausted and stagnate. Burning firewood to make a fire works well if the firewood is plentiful, but if there is too much, the fire will be suffocated and extinguished. Eating food to fill the stomach works well if one is hungry, but overeating will stagnate the system and injure the spleen and stomach. The current social pathology is that the means of production are concentrated in the hands of a few people. Because of the greatness of productivity, these means of production do not even require a large number of workers. But the drawback is that the accumulation of products cannot find a suitable consumer base. As a result, there is an unprecedented panic. The current international pathology is that gold is concentrated in a few countries, and within these few countries, it is concentrated in the hands of a few financial giants. After repeated financial panics, several major American banks have boasted in their business reports that their cash reserves far exceed the legal requirements. But the drawback is that the weak are exhausted and die, while the strong swell and become bloated. At its worst, the reactionaries rise up and declare a revolution against the power of gold.

<h3>MacDonald and Roosevelt Discuss the Overall Economic Situation While Boating on the River</h3>
<p>Agreement Reached on Stabilizing World Currency Principles</p>
<p>Will Greatly Increase the Success of Disarmament and Economic Conferences</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister MacDonald spent the whole day cruising on the Potomac River today.</p>
<p>(First Statement) After returning, they jointly issued a statement, stating that they had spent the day thoroughly studying the Disarmament Conference and both sides felt that the results of their talks would greatly enhance the prospects for the success of the Disarmament Conference and the World Economic Conference. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Second Statement) The White House then issued a second statement, which was very brief, stating that Roosevelt and MacDonald were of the same mind as Herriot regarding the stabilization of currency, especially the stabilization of the U.S. dollar, and that they were urgently seeking a way to stabilize gold and the dollar on a firm basis. The monetary issues at the World Economic Conference were also discussed.</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. President and the British Prime Minister discussed the issues of war debt reduction, tax cuts, and the restoration of the international monetary standard.</p>
<h3>Convening of the World Economic Conference</h3>
<p>(Washington) The New York Times reported today that the key points currently being studied by British and American experts, with the aim of reaching an Anglo-American agreement before the World Economic Conference, include a multi-faceted treaty to determine the equivalence between gold and silver to stabilize currency systems. The proposed equivalence is approximately 30% gold and 5% silver, according to the report. The newspaper also stated that British Prime Minister MacDonald will issue a notice to all countries within a week, announcing that the World Economic Conference will be convened in London on June 15th. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Many points have already been agreed upon, so economic experts believe that these talks can be described as the most effective and rapidly progressing international conference. (National News Agency dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) An economic and financial experts meeting was convened in the White House tonight. Local circles here generally believe that this is an indication that the US President and the British Prime Minister have reached a consensus in principle regarding the method of stabilizing world currencies. Before the meeting at the White House, these experts held discussions with US Secretary of State Hull and British Ambassador Lindsay. Immediately after President Roosevelt and Prime Minister MacDonald returned from boating on the Potomac River, the White House meeting was convened. It is reported that the two leaders discussed all issues related to various countries in the boat. (National News Agency dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>This is the so-called abandonment of the gold standard. The monopoly of gold has triggered an international monetary revolution. The monopoly of the means of production, and the shape of its conflicts, is also becoming increasingly acute within the society of capitalist powers. It will inevitably follow the completion of the international monetary revolution and ultimately lead to the complete shattering of the monopoly of the means of production. This is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>The United States of America has almost exhausted its ability to struggle against this international monetary revolution. Throughout the term of the Hoover administration, it made tireless efforts to maintain the gold standard. Even during the election campaign, the Democratic Party's platform still regarded maintaining the dignity of the currency system as its responsibility. However, since the so-called Roosevelt policy focuses on reducing tariff barriers, raising prices, and solving unemployment problems, we have already determined that there is no other path to follow except to abolish the gold standard. Without abolishing the gold standard and attempting to reduce tariff barriers, the resulting dumping of foreign goods would inevitably lead to another drop in prices and another increase in unemployment. The entire plan would fall into contradiction. If international cooperation is sought, then the attempt to maintain the gold standard would be a major weakness that could be exploited diplomatically. Excessive concessions would be unacceptable, and excessive hopes for others would only lead to empty promises. In short, for more than a year, America's struggle to maintain the gold standard has reached the stage of exhaustion, and the intensification of external contradictions has everywhere accelerated the intensification of internal contradictions. To reduce the power of the exchange conditions proposed by the nations in the upcoming Washington conference and to consider the entire economic organization, there is no other way but to succumb to the forces of the international monetary revolution.</p>
<p>There is something else we can generally see. First, while the British and French representatives were on their Atlantic voyage, the United States, with lightning speed, announced the abolition of the gold standard, causing those who came with high hopes to leverage it to lose their main goal of presenting a counter-proposal. The disappointment is self-evident. It is well known that the so-called Washington Conference is nothing more than another live drama of mutual deception that has been performed in international conferences between the powers throughout history. To talk about international cooperation in this way is like seeking skin from a tiger. Second, since Great Britain abandoned the gold standard, it has used its low currency value to invade the American market in trade. Japan has used its even lower currency value to invade the British market. All kinds of boasts about domestic economic recovery and prosperity are almost entirely the result of impoverishing one's neighbors. Now, the United States has also abandoned its gold standard. From the American point of view, this is almost the last shot of adrenaline in the final struggle. But from the perspective of the entire capitalist world, what the United States gains is what Britain and Japan lose. Multiplication and subtraction cancel each other out, and the result is almost zero. Although the international commodity market has undergone drastic changes as a result, it is only a flash in the pan. The greatest effect is no more than the precedent set by Hoover's suspension of war debt payments.</p>
<h3>Experts Studying Currency Stabilization</h3>
<p>Anglo-American Opinions Fail to Align</p>
<p>The content of today's discussions between British and American experts has not been announced, but it is widely believed that in addition to the issue of currency stabilization, British and American experts are also considering the issue of global expansion. They propose that countries with abundant financial resources jointly form financial institutions to assist countries with weak financial resources through normal trade channels. If this is the case, prices can be expected to rise, and international trade can be restored. The experts will meet with the British Prime Minister and the US President tonight. According to the New York Tribune today, today's meeting is a testament to keen minds understanding the truth, rather than an attitude of all things being lovely in paradise. It is expected that this meeting may result in an international tariff truce. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Today, the experts will report to the heads of state of both countries on the extent of agreement reached on various issues when discussing the overall international economic situation, and provide consultation to the two leaders. As for the points on which the experts failed to agree, it is reported that Roosevelt and MacDonald will continue to discuss them personally. After three hours of discussion, it was agreed that the experts would follow new instructions and meet with Secretary of State Hull again tomorrow morning for discussion, and then report to the White House. Roosevelt and MacDonald will wait for the experts' report before reconvening tomorrow afternoon for further consultations.</p>
<p>(New York) Experts here generally believe that the prices of US and British currencies should be fixed simultaneously. British experts advocate that $3.50 USD be equivalent to £1 GBP, while Americans advocate that $4 USD be equivalent to £1 GBP, and want to fix the US dollar at 85 cents. (Reuters dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources, the method of stabilizing the gold dollar is actually the point of greatest difference in opinion among the experts. The original proposal called for the value of the gold dollar to be between 50 and 85 cents, and the value of the pound sterling to be between $3.00 and $3.80 in new gold dollars. However, experts hold different opinions on finding a suitable compromise value between these two numbers, and opinions vary greatly. However, according to those close to the experts' meeting, it is predicted that this matter will not be difficult to resolve. When considering stabilizing currency prices, the interests of small countries must be taken into account, as many small countries rely on large countries to stabilize the value of their currencies. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) When British and American experts met at the State Department to discuss economic issues, American experts put forward a general plan for international currency devaluation, based on the following three principles: (1) Currency devaluation must be carried out by all countries simultaneously. (2) Currency devaluation should bring all currencies down to below their current real value. (3) Currency devaluation should allow cash to be automatically and evenly distributed. The so-called real value in the second item refers to the value represented by a currency after it has been re-organized by another country, and this value should be maintained automatically without the need for intervention. In addition, American experts believe that if tariff restrictions are removed, the value of various currencies will increase. Therefore, the more a country removes tariff barriers, the greater its currency should be devalued. British and American experts completed their review of the issues raised by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister MacDonald at 6:00 PM yesterday and submitted a report to the White House at 9:00 PM in the evening. The experts will continue to meet at the State Department today. (Havas dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<h3>Silver Subsidiary Coinage Problem Under Consideration</h3>
<p>Regarding the silver issue, there is very little discussion in Washington today. It is reported that Roosevelt and MacDonald have considered using silver widely as subsidiary coinage, but have not mentioned bimetallism. Observers believe that this is a problem for the United States, but representatives from other countries must also consider it. Currently, a majority in the US Senate favor minting more silver coins, but the silver faction leader seems to be waiting for the President to discuss with MacDonald and Héroult before proposing a number for the government to be authorized to mint, and then passing the number accordingly. It is expected that the President and MacDonald will complete their talks tomorrow. (National News Agency dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Several economic experts who did not directly participate in the talks claimed tonight that, according to what they have heard, the President plans to immediately discuss with the British Prime Minister and Héroult the methods of returning the gold dollar and the gold pound to the gold standard, and the possibility of widely using silver in the minting of subsidiary coinage. However, they do not expect the three to propose the widespread adoption of bimetallism. In addition, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters after attending Secretary of State Hull's meeting with experts that today's discussion focused on the future of silver. The discussion was entirely technical, and although opinions varied greatly, the discussion was always harmonious and friendly. It is also said that when the experts were summoned to the White House meeting, the rumors circulating abroad about the talks reaching a stalemate were not confirmed in any way. (National News Agency dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Héroult Will Speak with Roosevelt Separately After MacDonald</h3>
<p>Hoping for a Combined Political and Economic Solution</p>
<p>Technical Aspects Will Likely Change</p>
<p>(Washington) Although former French Premier Héroult arrived in Washington during the US President's boating trip on the river, he did not participate in the White House meeting tonight. It is reported that his first direct discussion with the US President will be on Monday evening. When Héroult met with reporters today, he stated that he will tell President Roosevelt on Monday that France intends to maintain the gold standard and hopes to see the United States, Britain, and other countries stabilize their currency prices and return to the gold standard as soon as possible. Although there are many issues he wants to discuss, he intends to first discuss the financial crisis, because he feels that there can hardly be any progress in restoring world trade until exchange rates are stabilized. (National News Agency dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The next step will be the talks between President Roosevelt and French representative Héroult. When Héroult arrived, Secretary of State Hull personally welcomed him. Héroult told reporters that he will raise the issue of international security. He believes that political and economic issues must be studied in combination. After arriving in Washington, Héroult immediately consulted with the French Ambassador to the United States and experts on everything. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) In the evening, French representative Héroult and members of the delegation dined at the French Embassy. Héroult also declared to newspaper reporters that the United States' abandonment of the gold standard has changed the technical aspects of the issues he and President Roosevelt will discuss, but the basic points of the issues and the purpose of the talks have not changed at all, as the purpose of this talk is to revive the world economy. Héroult also said that the World Economic Conference was originally proposed by the Lausanne Conference. At that time, German reparations had been virtually eliminated. Héroult continued that France is very concerned about the Economic Conference, but does not want to make a more specific explanation of the nature of his mission to Washington. Finally, he paid great respect to President Roosevelt, calling him a "man of great courage." (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Héroult Presents Himself as a Franc Representative</h3>
<p>(Paris) A special correspondent for (Le Petit Parisien) who accompanied the French delegation to the United States recently sent a telegram from the (Île de France) mail ship, stating that European countries such as France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland are maintaining a unified line of defense for the gold standard after the United States abandoned the gold standard, and are not following in the footsteps of the United States. This letter has given the delegation's experts a good impression. According to a report from a special correspondent for (Les Affaires), Héroult declared, "I am a representative of the (Franc). In other words, I am only participating in the talks as an observer and cannot control the Franc."</p>
<h3>Declaration Upon Arrival in New York</h3>
<p>(New York) Former French Premier Héroult, ordered to come to the United States to participate in the Washington talks, recently arrived in port aboard the (Île de France) mail ship and immediately issued a declaration, broadcast by radio. His words were: "As I set foot on American soil, I wish, in the name of the French government and the French people, to express my admiration for the American nation. The American people are rich in thought and have a firm spirit. The various difficulties they encounter are the same as those of our country, and their people can do their best to overcome them. The scourge of unemployment cannot be avoided by any country. Most American families are harmed by it. I deeply know the suffering in this, so I have infinite sympathy for the American people. For this trip, I have selected several of the most knowledgeable experts in France to bring with me to meet with your president, hoping to discuss feasible ways to save the world economy from panic and to free ourselves from the suffering caused by economic panic in an extremely free and sincere attitude. I am a person who firmly believes in peace, so the purpose of my work is only to seek the realization of peace, but I believe that the construction of peace should be sought simultaneously in the political and economic spheres. France is a nation that loves peace, and I will do my best to ensure that France's peaceful aspirations can be expressed to the world. What we have recently heard on the boat in the Atlantic Ocean is indeed enough to change the technical outlines of the issues, but the political and spiritual outlines remain the same. We still maintain complete confidence. We have come here with unlimited sincerity of cooperation to meet with the American government and people, without harboring other intentions. British Prime Minister MacDonald and I are old friends. In 1924 in London and in 1932 in Lausanne and Geneva, the two of us have worked together to promote the friendship of all nations. How happy I am to meet him again!" (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Financial Policy</h3>
<p>Responding to the Economic Conference</p>
<p>Considering Changes in Approach</p>
<p>Ishii Scheduled to Visit Washington Early Next Month</p>
<p>Determined to Pursue Free Trade Principles</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Controls to Be Implemented Next Month</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's economic and financial policies will be changed depending on the outcome of the World Economic Conference. The changes in policy currently being considered by the Ministry of Finance are as follows: (Financial Policy) (1) Revise the fundamental plan of finance, increase taxes to increase income, but the timing will be after the economic recovery. (2) Reorganize administration and save expenses. (3) Reduce Manchurian Incident expenses, military equipment improvement expenses, and current situation relief expenses at appropriate times. (Economic Policy) (1) Adjust finance, that is, continuously supply the currency required for industrial transactions, while preventing the ills of extreme inflation. (2) Implement a low interest rate policy. (3) Closely coordinate various financial institutions to achieve financial control. (4) Stabilize exchange rates, that is, use the exchange rate control law to prevent unnatural declines or fluctuations in exchange rates. (5) Stop lending speculative funds to prevent general speculation. (United News dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ishii and his party are scheduled to depart from Yokohama on the Tatsuta Maru on May 4 and arrive in Washington on the 23rd to attend the preliminary talks for the Economic Conference. (Electric Communications dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding Japan's position on the World Economic Conference, issues related to tariffs and treaties are more deeply connected to its interests than financial issues. Therefore, the government has ordered relevant ministries to conduct detailed studies on countermeasures for points expected to become issues at the conference regarding freedom of international trade, tariffs, and treaty revisions. However, it is anticipated that concrete conclusions will be difficult to obtain on the tariff issue, even after the preparatory meeting in Washington and the formal meeting in London. There are three reasons for this: the different tariff systems of the countries, the peculiarities of domestic industries in the countries, and the different exchange markets in the countries. Because countries have such complex and intricate positions, the conference will inevitably be difficult to decide. The Japanese side has always expressed its approval of the principle of free trade, especially at a time when actions oppressing Japanese goods are most prominent, such as in China, India, and Egypt. It is determined to point this out and implement the principle of abolishing international trade restrictions. Therefore, appropriate tax rates must be agreed upon based on the special circumstances of each country's industry and currency system. Therefore, it is more appropriate for the formal meeting in London to have each country hold separate tariff conferences. However, even if the London meeting proceeds smoothly, it is already commendable to decide to hold these individual meetings. How can we expect anything else? (Electric Communications dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The detailed rules for the implementation of Japan's Foreign Exchange Control Law are being drafted by the Ministry of Finance and have been completed. They will be decided by the Cabinet Council on the 26th and announced immediately, and will be implemented from May 1. The main points of difference between the new law and the capital flight law are as follows: (1) The number of items requiring government permission has increased. (2) Cracking down on exports without bills of exchange. (3) Letters of credit for foreign travelers have been changed to a permission system. (4) The export and transfer of foreign securities requires permission. (7) Using the Foreign Exchange Control Law to prevent fluctuations in exchange rates. (8) In order to prevent speculation, the source of its financing will be restricted. (China United Press dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance has now promulgated the following detailed rules for the implementation of the Foreign Exchange Control Law: (1) Gold coins, gold bars, and items made of gold are not allowed to be exported without a license. (2) Speculative transactions in foreign exchange and currency are prohibited. (3) The purchase of foreign currency with Japanese yen within Japan is generally prohibited without a license.

<h3>Vietnam Follows India's Footsteps in Resisting the Dumping of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to news received by Japanese traders, the French Annam government feels insecure about its industries due to the policy of dumping Japanese goods, and will raise tariffs on Japanese goods to resist their dumping policy. The Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry believes that Japanese goods are being rejected everywhere, and has decided to use the Important Industries Control Law and the Important Trade Goods Control Law to impose necessary controls on enterprise organizations, industrial associations, and export associations, seeking to ease the policy of resisting Japanese goods in various countries through this policy.

<h3>Russian-Japanese Relations Worsen</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Refuses to Return Locomotives</p>
<p>Japanese Reportedly to Take Action</p>
<p>Russian Government Releases Correspondence</p>
<p>(Harbin) Regarding the issue of the ownership of locomotives for through transport on the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Trans-Baikal Railway in Siberia, protests and rebuttals between Russia (puppet) continue endlessly. The (puppet) Manchurian side has decided that if the Soviet Russian side does not return the 73 locomotives before the May 12 deadline, it will take a second round of substantial action. On the other hand, as of today, the Soviet Russian side has only returned four locomotives, and the return of freight cars, which had been returned continuously in recent days, was also suspended a few days ago, and the situation is deteriorating further. (Electric Communications dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Correspondence between Li Shaogeng, the director and deputy director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and Koznetsov regarding the obstruction of the road's traffic order due to the coercive behavior of the Japanese (Manchu) authorities was released here today. Koznetsov received two letters from Li on April 12 and 18, respectively. The first letter stated that a large number of Chinese Eastern Railway vehicles had been detained by the Ussuri Railway and requested their swift return. In addition, he also requested the return of certain locomotives in Soviet territory. In the second letter, Li stated that the connection between the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Outer Baikal Railway in Manchuria was forcibly cut off, in accordance with the order of the (Manchukuo) Department of Roads and Transportation, with the purpose of protecting the property of the Chinese Eastern Railway and stopping undue direct traffic. As for international traffic, Li stated that it was not obstructed, and the (Manchu) side had no intention of obstructing it. Koznetsov replied to Li's two letters on April 20, stating that he had firmly protested the violent behavior of the road police at the Manchuria station on April 10. The letter did not contain a reply regarding the Soviet Union's right to direct transport on the Chinese Eastern Railway. Koznetsov provided a detailed explanation of this right and requested the immediate cancellation of the above-mentioned coercive behavior and instructions. In addition, Koznetsov inquired about when negotiations would begin on the Chinese Eastern Railway and Soviet Railway Through Traffic Agreement proposed by the (Manchukuo) Department of Roads and Transportation. Koznetsov expressed his hope for a quick reply to the above questions, and then said that there were several points that must be explained here, namely, the so-called in the letter (Chinese Eastern Railway</p>

The militia and garrison are currently cooperating in suppressing them. Also, the bandit Yang Hou'er's force has fled from Longdong to the Dingwan area in northern Shaanxi and is currently attempting to move west. Hongying has been dispatched with a team to block them.

<h3>Universal Postal Union Conference</h3>
<p>China Decides to Send Representatives to Attend</p>
<p>(Nanjing) China has decided to send representatives to attend this year's Universal Postal Union Conference, which will be held in Argentina, and is preparing a proposal to impose appropriate sanctions on Japan for instigating puppet organizations to plunder the postal rights of the three northeastern provinces and destroying the Universal Postal Union Convention, and to unanimously deny the puppet organization's post office. Secondly, proposals will also be made regarding China's plan to expand international postal services. The selection of representatives is still in progress. (Special dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<h3>Wuhu-Zhapu Railway Foundation Stone Laid Today in Wuhu</h3>
<p>Zhang Jingjiang Arrives in Wuhu</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Members of the Central Executive Committee Zhang Renjie and Li Shizeng and others established the Jiangnan Railway Company to build the Wuhu-Zhapu railway line. Preparations have now been completed, and the foundation stone laying ceremony will be held on the 25th at the Wuhu Railway Pier. An invitation has been sent to all sectors of society in Beijing and Shanghai to attend the ceremony. The railway will run from Wuhu through Wanzhi, Xuancheng, Sunjiabu, Guangde, Sian, Huzhou, Nanxun, Shengze, Jiaxing, and Pinghu to Zhapu. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 24th)</p>

After the foundation stone laying ceremony for the Wuhu-Zhapu Railway is held on the 25th, he will personally inspect the railway line along Xuancheng and Sunjiabu. (Special dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing National Salvation Association Burning Mail Incident</h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications Submits Request to Executive Yuan for Instructions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Chongqing National Salvation Association's burning of mail, the Ministry of Communications repeatedly telegraphed the military and political authorities of Sichuan Province, strictly ordering them to stop it. In addition to a letter to the Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Communications has continued to submit a request to the Executive Yuan for instructions. The original text reads: "Regarding the continued submission of information, upon investigation of the Chongqing National Salvation Association's burning of mail case, detailed information on the process has been reported by the Directorate General of Posts. It has been found that the troops dispatched by the Chongqing Garrison Command to suppress and guard the lighters were suddenly withdrawn without prior notification, (which is a joint business of the two countries). It is clear that ownership and management rights are being confused. The CER is the property of the Soviet Union, only placed under joint management. Furthermore, in your phone conversation with Rudy, you were aware that the railway administration paid close attention to the events of April 7th. On that day, the border police commander notified the Manchouli station master in an official document, stating that instructions had been received from the (puppet state) government to suspend freight transport and await resolution by the two governments. Subsequently, the track switch was locked and a warning was attached, declaring that any attempt to release vehicles to the Trans-Baikal Railway or allow vehicles from that railway to enter would be forcibly prevented. It was also stated that goods seized would not be allowed to pass until instructions were received from the (puppet state) government. Vehicles arriving from the Trans-Baikal Railway would not be allowed to return after unloading their cargo. It should be noted that these instructions have not been rescinded to this day. The railway administration requested instructions from us on April 8th regarding this obstruction of traffic, stating that railways belonging to the International Railway Association had telegraphed, inquiring about the possibility of replacing the CER in serving Eurasian transport. For the benefit of the CER and the country, the administration is still awaiting a concrete explanation of the Manchouli incident and the revocation of the order obstructing traffic. In terms of responsibility, although such inquiries should be answered immediately, the administration has not yet issued a response and is awaiting our joint measures. The agency obstructing Eurasian transport this time is the (puppet state) authorities, especially the representatives of the Department of Road Transport. Due to their instructions, the Manchouli police dared to illegally damage the interests of the CER. It is hoped that you can, with the aim of preserving the international obligations of the CER, ensure that the authorities revoke the order to forcibly stop vehicles, and that the administration can also respond to the inquiries of the participants in the International Railway Association by resuming direct traffic." (TASS dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Leading to the burning of mail and at a time when riotous elements are using the name of national salvation to act arbitrarily, who should be responsible for compensating for all mail burned in this case? And what security measures should be taken for lighters in the future to prevent further complications? All of these matters require local military and civilian authorities to effectively maintain order." Therefore, a copy is respectfully submitted for your review. Respectfully presented to the Executive Yuan. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Debt of Various Railways Largely Sorted Out</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the establishment of the Committee for the Sorting of Railway Debts, organized by the Ministry of Railways, the debts of various railways have been largely sorted out. The Tientsin-Pukou Railway's German-issued bonds are being paid off with monthly special funds saved from the railway's administrative revenue, and the interest on these bonds has been cleared. As a result, the price of these bonds has increased sharply in the European market. Due to the limited revenue of the Hubei-Hunan Railway, it is unable to raise funds to pay the principal and interest on the Hukuang Railway bonds itself. The Ministry of Railways has managed to raise funds to pay the interest due. The debts of other railways are also being sorted out step by step. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Central Party Headquarters Warns Party Members in All Regions</h3>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Collusion with Local Bullies to Exploit the People</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Party Headquarters, noting that party members in various regions are colluding with local bullies to exploit the people, causing riots, issued a general warning yesterday, stating: "Recently, it has been found that party members in various regions are degenerating, associating with corrupt local bullies, such as in the previous cases in Suxian and Lingbi counties in Anhui, where the collection of tobacco taxes sparked peasant riots. According to investigations, some individuals, as party members, colluded with local bullies to force tobacco taxes or openly served as members of the tobacco tax collection committee, which is a disgrace to party discipline. In addition to investigating and severely punishing them, the party headquarters in all regions are instructed to warn their subordinate party members to restrain themselves and cherish their reputation. If anyone oppresses and exploits the people, the Central Government will strictly enforce party discipline and national law. All must comply." (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Gao Lingwei and Others Appeal on Behalf of the People of Hebei Province</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Gao Lingwei, Zhang Zhitang, Hua Shikuai, Chen Baoquan, Yan Zhiyi, and dozens of other citizens of Hebei Province telegraphed the provincial and municipal governments on the 24th, stating: "The people are the foundation of the state, and the family is the home of the people. If the family is destroyed, the people will disperse; if the people disperse, the state will perish. Since the September 18th Incident, the three northeastern provinces have been lost due to non-resistance, and tens of millions of displaced soldiers and civilians have sought food in Hebei. For over a year, Rehe and Yuyu have been lost due to unprepared resistance, and hundreds of miles have been lost. The various passes of the Great Wall are not without brave and capable soldiers, but their supplies rely entirely on the local areas, and bullets still require payment. The soldiers and civilians are in dire straits, no different from giving land to the enemy. Recently, Luandong has retreated as it resisted, already reaching Luanxi. Although the newspapers have exaggerated the tragic facts of enemy aircraft, the number of casualties inflicted by the enemy is limited, and most casualties are caused by artillery fire. In particular, eight or nine out of ten women have been beheaded, disemboweled, and hanged in the woods, continuously along the roads. In some cases, as many as seven people are hanged from one tree, a heartbreaking and appalling sight, even unheard of in the Shanghai battle. Now that the enemy is pressing closer, cries are spreading everywhere, and Beiping and Tianjin are as precarious as a pile of eggs. If we continue to hesitate and fail to make a decision, we will be creating opportunities for national traitors. Shikuai and others live in seclusion, constantly in a state of accumulated firewood under the eaves, anxious day and night, forgetting meals and abandoning sleep. Surrendering to the enemy is unrighteous, betraying the country is disloyal, sitting idly by is inhumane, and sacrificing oneself is unfilial. We can only appeal to the gentlemen of the government to make a final decision, either to leave a glorious name for posterity or to leave a glimmer of hope for the people's survival. Do not allow the current state of being neither dead nor alive to continue and lead to mutual destruction. Some say that the transportation of antiques indicates an intention to abandon Hebei, and the delay in providing support shows the gradual sacrifice of North China. Shikuai and others believe that the National Government is the government of the whole country and treats everyone equally. It would never divide territories. In a state of deep water and scorching fire, we are desperately appealing to the gentlemen of the government to quickly order the authorities in North China to find ways to save the lives of tens of millions of people. We are overwhelmed with tears as we await orders." (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Hitler's Speech Again Throws a Smokescreen at its Western Neighbors</h3>
<p>Saying That National Revolution Cannot Be Completed by Fear and Weakness</p>
<p>But Rather by Building a Pillar of National Spirit with Courage</p>
<p>Munich, 23rd (National Telegram) - Today, German Chancellor Hitler delivered a speech to the local National Socialist Party leaders, in which he stated that Germany now needs peace and will do its utmost to guarantee it. However, on the other hand, Germany also insists that it must enjoy equal treatment with other countries in world politics. Regarding internal affairs, Hitler said that the government's war against Marxism will never be relaxed, and even if Marxism seems to be feigning death at the moment, it will inevitably be destroyed. Furthermore, the national revolution will not be completed until Germany's internal and external affairs have been thoroughly reorganized. (The creation of a nation's history cannot be the responsibility of those who are fearful, weak, lukewarm, but rather rests on those who have the courage to fight the enemy. Today, the National Socialist Party has shouldered over two thousand years of German history and culture, and it will certainly not fail in this responsibility, but will create a new, greater, and immortal monument that will forever remain among nations as a pillar of the German national spirit.) Hitler concluded by saying that today's nationalist movement is not working for current interests, but is striving for the judgment of future generations.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (National Telegram) - French Premier Daladier's speech in Orange on Sunday has aroused suspicion in Germany, because in his speech to the Reichstag on March 21, German Chancellor Hitler fully expressed the German people's desire for peace. This is truly the aspiration of the entire German people, but Daladier's words seem to indicate that France still intends to adhere to its consistent policy of the past fourteen years, and will maintain all the special interests given to France by the Treaty of Paris without any relaxation. This kind of view can be said to stand in opposition to Europe and Germany. As for the so-called need for freedom to be guaranteed, etc., it is also meaningless. For example, Germany has suffered all kinds of sacrifices for many years in order to gain a little freedom, but France is still unwilling to grant it. Furthermore, as Daladier said, the Germans do not know what to make of the so-called fear outside the French border, because the Ruhr region only saw the invasion of the French and all kinds of atrocities committed against the local patriotic people. Regarding economic issues, Daladier said that France is not afraid of currency inflation in other countries, etc. However, people around the world should remember France's attacks on the currency systems of Germany, Austria, Britain, and the United States over the years, without regard for the adverse effects on the world and the blows suffered by various countries.</p>

<h3>Shaking Japanese Politics (Japanese Correspondence)</h3>
<p>The Japanese Government Has Two Current Difficulties</p>
<p>The Chinese Eastern Railway and Pacific Economic Issues</p>
<p>Japan got (Manchuria), and finally settled its decades-long wish. Recently, it also very safely occupied Jehol. That was truly unexpected good fortune. According to ordinary logic, it should be satisfied and its prosperity should have reached its peak. Why is it still singing about an extraordinary period and even saying that it is a super-extraordinary period? Originally, the Japanese imperialism, which is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, has long been known to the world. It uses inciting foreign wars and stimulating the primitive aggressive psychology of its domestic people as a smokescreen for all its domestic contradictions, concealing all its economic and political ugliness, and making the general public forget their immediate pain. This kind of morphine injection is indeed effective. In addition to anesthetizing the general Japanese people, it has also expanded its territory and occupied more than 4.3 million square miles of Chinese land, but it is still of no help to Japan's poverty. Its so-called extraordinary period continues to expand. This is not because China is singing (resistance to the end), causing Japan to have difficulties in combat, nor is it because the Japanese army has suffered any major losses from the Chinese army's counterattacks, but rather because difficulties outside of China have increased, and at the same time, the general social unrest in Japan has increased.</p>
<p>The first is the Chinese Eastern Railway issue. On the Japanese side, since driving away Sūmǎ, it wanted to take the opportunity to buy it into Japanese hands, as its own tool, in order to completely swallow the three northeastern provinces. However, the Soviet Union will never give in, and moved more than 1,000 locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars into Soviet territory. In the middle of this month, international trains were suspended twice. On the surface, it was a conflict between the Soviet Union and the puppet state, but in reality, it goes without saying that it was a dispute between Japan and the Soviet Union. While the Soviet Union certainly does not want to go to war with Japan, which would hinder its construction work, Japan is also unwilling to lightly start a war, so as not to provoke serious consequences. The current posture of rubbing fists and palms against the Soviet Union is to show England, and at the same time, to express goodwill to England, saying that Japan is indeed preventing the Soviet Union, and will further advance towards Duolun and Zhangjiakou, putting Inner Mongolia in its pocket, showing its loyalty to capitalism and its courage to aggress. However, this kind of action depends on the army as the main force and requires more military spending. This is its first difficulty.</p>
<p>The second is economic competition in the Pacific. Since the American financial panic occurred, Japan's raw silk exports to the United States will be severely hit. If the United States really abandons the gold standard, then Japan's import of American cotton will be disadvantageous. Moreover, the American economic union led by the United States is bound to give Japan an even more severe attack. Britain used to be Japan's ally, and has recently maintained friendly relations, but in terms of economics, especially in the Chinese and Indian markets, the competition of textiles cannot be reconciled after all. And the British economic union is the most powerful in the world and has been implementing the most effective measures since the Ottawa Conference. These are all Japan's opponents, and are the second factor contributing to the extraordinary period of Japanese imperialism.</p>
<p>Therefore, rumors of a political upheaval in Japan spread every day, especially with the Seiyūkai and the Kokumin Dōmei secretly carrying out a no-confidence motion. In normal times, the Seiyūkai has 298 seats and the Kokumin Dōmei has 20 seats. Undoubtedly, the power to overthrow the cabinet is more than enough. But after all the noise, it is only said that the issue of Takashi Korekiyo (Minister of Finance)'s resignation has arisen, and there is a lack of integrity in the cabinet. Only when Saito falls, will the joint resignation occur. A few days ago, Justice Minister Oyama Matsukichi could not but submit his resignation due to the issue of judicial officials becoming communist, which aroused the relationship of responsibility, but it was appeased by the imperial order, and it has already disappeared. Takahashi's resignation has become an even more mysterious state of mind. Isn't this a strange event in Japanese politics?</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, it is not worth anything. The two difficulties mentioned above have caused the Japanese government to fall into a more difficult situation. This difficult situation was created by the Japanese military itself. Now, to open up a way out, the opinion of the military is that the political parties should not be the main force, but the military should be the vanguard. Especially regarding the invasion of North China, it is necessary to do it vigorously and take advantage of the imperfect relationship between Britain and the United States to more easily create new facts. Therefore, although Takahashi is threatened by the Seiyūkai and wants to resign and dismantle the Saito cabinet, the military wants to support Saito. Therefore, Takahashi's resignation may not occur until after the May 15 Incident, or until the army's public trial of the case in August, or even after the judicial public trial of the case at the end of the year. Then the Saito cabinet can still maintain the status quo, and the Japanese army will continue to oppress North China. (Tokyo, April 18, 1933)</p>
<h3>Jilin Righteous Army Persists in Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>Li Du's Troops Stationed Around Boli and Mishan</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese United Army Still Occupies Various Counties and Towns in Northern Jilin</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Peiping - The Japanese regard the eastern half of Jilin as a base for self-defense forces, so they are extremely resentful of the residents of that area. Every time the Japanese army is stationed there, they cut off pedestrian traffic after sunset. Anyone who violates this is arrested and taken to the headquarters of the military police, and transported by car to secluded places at night, where they are stabbed to death with spears, or their heads are covered with burlap bags, and they are made to stand in a row in a suitable location, and used as meat stakes for machine gun exercises. In Lishu Town, a fourteen-year-old boy who sold peanuts was arrested for walking at night. The owner of the Sanhelong trading company was accused of being a bandit because there was a bullet belt in his store, and he was taken along with the boy to the stone pit on Nanshan Head, where they were used as meat stakes for machine gun exercises. According to the local residents, no fewer than seventy people were shot or stabbed to death in the stone pit. During the day, there is no one there. When walking near the pit, ferocious dogs gather, staring and baring their teeth at strangers. As for the Japanese troops in other counties such as Ning'an, Muling, Mishan, Boli, and Yilan, according to local residents, they only know that they have arrested many people, and none have been released. They are all secretly stabbed to death with spears and sent to distant places by car. The reason for their murder is often that they are accused in anonymous letters or that suspicious items are found during inspections, and they are immediately arrested. In early March, when the East China Railway was about to resume full operation, when the train came from the east and arrived at the Mudanjiang Bridge, anyone suspected during the inspection on the bridge was stabbed to death under the bridge. Those who feared their power and jumped off the bridge were also killed. There were also farmers coming from the east and going west who were subjected to mandatory guarantees during inspection. Those who had no guarantees were arrested, and the number of those who died without guarantees is unknown. If volunteers are captured by them, they are immediately forced to eat a lot of food. After they finish eating, they are taken to an open space and ordered to have three people hold up their hands and feet, lifting them overhead. Many of them die with ruptured abdomens. This is a summary of the major cases. As for those who died from other malicious means, they are too numerous to count. It is truly cruel.</p>
<p>Tian Jun, an officer of Li Du's troops of the Jilin Self-Defense Army, arrived in Peiping today from Jilin. According to his statement, the various units of the Jilin Self-Defense Army are still in various counties on the eastern border of Jilin. Before January 10 of this year, they were still guarding the towns of Xiachengzi, Muling County, and Lishu Town along the Chinese Eastern Railway. Later, because of the lack of ammunition and the difficulty in providing supplies, it was difficult to be effective in resisting the violent Japanese, who had ample military supplies. Moreover, the Japanese were accustomed to using aircraft to bomb, while the Self-Defense Army had no air defense weapons. As a last resort, they withdrew from Xiachengzi, Muling, and Lishu Town in mid-January, with Mishan and Boli as the westernmost line of defense. In early March, the Japanese and puppet troops again recklessly invaded the east. Chen Zongdai's army of the Self-Defense Army stationed in Boli County was forced too much, and temporarily withdrew outside Boli City, confronting the Guo Brigade Gong Regiment of the puppet army stationed in the city. At the same time, my Liu Wankui army was also forced to withdraw near Mishan County, confronting the Guo Brigade Tao Regiment of the puppet army stationed in Pingyang Army and the Guo Brigade Jia Regiment stationed in Mishan County. On March 10, the Self-Defense Army launched a counterattack and recovered Pingyang Town and Mishan, but withdrew again due to the Japanese air force bombing. They are still in Mishan. Lu Yongcai, Wang Yong, and other troops are stationed outside the cities of Hulin, Raohe, Fuyuan, and Baoqing (with a small number of Japanese and puppet troops in the cities) to provide rear support. Near Xingkai Lake on the Russian border, there are more than 3,000 troops of Zhang Yuting's army. On March 12, they joined forces with Lu Yongcai and Liu Wankui's troops and captured Dongning. The puppet county magistrate and the councilor (Japanese) were both shot dead. They have now withdrawn. In general, the Japanese are in the midst of the battle in Rehe, and the rear is extremely empty. There are no heavy troops stationed in Liaoning, Changchun, Jilin, and Harbin. Each city has only three or four hundred Japanese soldiers, who travel east and west every day, parading and demonstrating to create a false impression. As for the major stations along the Chinese Eastern Railway, each station has more than a hundred Japanese soldiers, and Ning'an, Xiachengzi, Muling, Mishan, Boli, and other places also each have one or two hundred or five or sixty Japanese soldiers, specializing in urging the puppet army to suppress the Self-Defense Army. At present, the Japanese have hired more than forty White Russians, giving them forty yuan in puppet currency per month to use them. The White Russians go out every day with guns for security. The Japanese do not trust the police in various places in eastern Jilin very much. They usually do not give them guns, and only issue them temporarily when something happens, and drive them out to fight. At present, the Self-Defense Army is fully concentrated, no less than 30,000, and is determined to attack the enemy's rear, but is waiting for the military authorities to find a way to provide assistance before it can easily move. The Japanese have occupied various towns along the Chinese Eastern Railway, and have made the residents open casinos, such as association bureaus, treasure bureaus, card games, mahjong, dice games, etc., without exception. The Japanese extract dividends from them. Stations south of Harbin have more dice and mahjong gambling, while stations east of Harbin have more association bureaus. For example, Lishu is a small town, and its association bureau once made 3,000 yuan a day, and it is known that the Japanese secretly profited from it. With this gambling atmosphere, the market is becoming more and more unstable, and robbery cases are heard from time to time, all caused by the scourge of gambling. Therefore, the general residents are eager for the Self-Defense Army to recover various places, because when the Self-Defense Army was stationed in various places before, it relied on the people for food and grass, but it also issued fair market prices, and its military discipline was extremely strict. It did not commit the slightest offense wherever it went, and did its best to protect the people, so that the people could live in peace. The residents did not feel great pain at that time. Now, under the oppressive power of the Japanese, they dare not even whisper on the streets, and they dare not criticize in private. Important villages in the countryside have been burned to the ground to prevent the Self-Defense Army from ambushing. Moreover, the people in the cities have become impoverished due to gambling, and the people in the countryside are also constantly frightened by the repeated battles between the Japanese and our armies. Farmers have stopped working and dare not do spring plowing, so they especially want to get rid of the Japanese oppression as soon as possible. The Japanese not only open gambling, but also instigate the puppet country to order the large-scale cultivation of opium in all the places they have invaded. The cities have already publicly sold opium. Taking Changchun as an example, there are more than 2,130 retail outlets for opium in Toudaogou, and 20 new opium sellers in the city have been added with permits purchased for 500 yuan. Each shop hangs a sign with the words (Opium Retail Outlet) in large letters. On the upper right corner of the sign, it says (Station Police Order No. so-and-so), and on the lower left corner, it says (Various Numbers of Opium Dens), such as Jinyunge, etc. There are female attendants in the dens. The wealthy people who have fled from the countryside to the cities often frequent them. If this continues for several years, the residents of the eastern provinces will probably become walking corpses, like the weak ghosts of Fufeng, and lose their strong physique. This is to see the Japanese conspiracy to eliminate the courage of our people to resist, and to affect their offspring and lead to their extinction.</p>
<p>Wang Shenxiu, Chief of Staff of the Jilin Anti-Japanese United Army Headquarters, also came to Peiping today from Jilin via a detour. He also talked about the current situation in Jilin, which is recorded as follows: (I set out from Mishan County, Jilin Province, on April 2 this year, disguised as refugees with several attendants. At that time, it was the second day after the enemy's attack on the county failed and they were forced to retreat. The Japanese and puppet troops along the way were extremely strict in their inspections. I waited for the train at Xiachengzi and delayed for several days before I could get on the train to the south, because small teams of our troops frequently operated between Mudanjiang and Ujimigawa along the Chinese Eastern Railway, specializing in destroying railways and preventing enemy troops from coming north, so the train schedule could not be determined. I got off the train in Harbin and stayed for two days to investigate the enemy's actions, and then took the train from Harbin to Liaoning. I prepared travel expenses and stayed in Shenyang for three days, and then took a train from Shenyang and went straight to Dalian. I did not stop in Dalian and took a boat that day, arriving in Tianjin at seven o'clock the next morning, and then took a train to Peiping. Since the enemy army failed once in January of this year, General Commander Chen has tried his best to reorganize and eliminate the bad elements, and has reorganized the entire army. At present, the actual strength has exceeded 100,000. Because the enemy army's previous failure was only a change of command and the disappearance of a few commanders, after recruitment, many people followed. Because the Japanese and puppet troops are oppressing too strictly, there is no fixed garrison area, because they are afraid of being surrounded by the enemy and bombed by airplanes, resulting in useless sacrifices. The enemy troops are currently stationed in Boli, Mishan, Ning'an, Hulin, Baoqing and other counties, temporarily hiding and holding on, and forming small teams of more than 1,000, with 50 or 100 people as a team, scattered in various counties, specializing in intercepting enemy military supplies, in order to supplement the needs of our army. The biggest difficulty for our army at present is supplies and ammunition. Moreover, the counties in northeastern Jilin have been fighting for two years since the United Army resisted Japan, and the local production has been stretched thin. In addition, the puppet army's violent collection and exploitation have made us lack strength. In order to exterminate them with all our strength, our army has no choice but to fight with our heads in desperation, and to seize them from the enemy's hands. Knowing that it is like hitting a stone with an egg, only suffering damage, what we rely on is spirit and flesh. If we can seize a liter of rice or a bullet, even if there are sacrifices, we can still supply our self-defense to kill the enemy and seek survival, so these small teams scattered in various counties can do their best, and the enemy's life can be extended to this day, which is also the reason. I came here to report the situation to the authorities and ask for all kinds of methods, and I also plan to report the battle process to the people and the key points for the people to support the Anti-Japanese Army, so as to avoid wasting useful money in useless places. As for the various anti-Japanese armies in the Northeast that are more complete and formal, they are part of the enemy army. Some others have fled, some have softened, and some have become bandits and refuse to surrender. Therefore, when I arrived in Harbin, the Japanese and puppet authorities were holding a meeting to resolve to increase the number of troops and press on our righteous army. And my coming here to negotiate is precisely the critical period for our righteous army, and I deeply hope that the people and the government will have practical assistance.) (21st)</p>
<h3>Anhui People Oppose Henan Province Diverting the Yellow River into the Huai River</h3>
<p>(Petition to the Executive Yuan for Review and Prohibition)</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Henan Province authorities, citing years of Yellow River flooding as the source of water disasters, plan to task the Department of Construction to work with the Flood Relief Committee to divert the Yellow River into the Huai River and southward into the Yangtze River. Anhui people's opposition is rampant. Previously, the Anhui Association for the Advancement of Huai River Management convened a meeting of representatives from various counties along the Huai River in Bengbu to discuss the proposal of Henan Province to divert the Yellow River into the Huai River and the Yangtze River. The meeting resolved to oppose it with determination and sent a telegram to various Yuan, Fu, and Associations, appealing to save the situation. The telegram reads as follows: (To President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, the Huai River Management Committee, Chairman Gu of Jiangsu Province, Chairman Liu of Henan Province, Chairman Wu of Anhui Province, and various fellow provincial associations in Tianjin, Shanghai, Beijing, and Anhui: Repeatedly received telegrams from Anhui natives abroad stating that the Henan Provincial Department of Construction has a plan to divert the Yellow River into the Huai River and the Yangtze River, which will endanger northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, and the Yangtze River area, causing great harm. Please jointly appeal to reverse this decision, etc. Although we have repeatedly contested this matter through letters and telegrams, requesting its prohibition, we fear that those in Henan Province who propose this may be unaware of the changing circumstances or believe that the construction of gates and embankments will provide a buffer and insist on their one-sided view. If a major mistake is made, not only will the lives and property of tens of millions of people downstream be lost forever, but the rivers of Jiang, Huai, He, and Han will be mixed into one, no different from the era of the great flood, which is extremely shocking. The magnitude of the disaster suffered by the downstream areas has already been detailed repeatedly by the people of Anhui and Huai, so there is no need to elaborate further. Moreover, the Yellow River stretches nearly ten thousand miles and is related to the interests of more than ten provinces in the north and south. It should be considered from an overall perspective and definitely not be easily diverted by Henan Province alone. In the year of Dinghai, the Zhengzhou breach caused the Yellow River to enter the Huai River through the Sha River, affecting thousands of miles and costing thousands of millions of silver dollars to reverse its northward course. Most recently, in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], the Jiang and Huai Rivers both flooded, not only could the Huai River not enter the Yangtze River, but the dikes and weirs along the Yangtze River collapsed, overturning their original purpose. The proposal to divert the Huai River into the Yangtze River has completely failed. How can we divert the Yellow River into the Huai River and the Yangtze River again? However, Henan Province refuses to change its plan and is requesting 3.4 million from the central government to start construction. Moreover, the Yellow River, flowing south, has encroached on the Huai River's path to the sea, forcing the Huai River into the Yangtze River, causing deep harm. At that time, there was no diversion into the Huai River, yet the Yellow River could still seize the Huai River. How much more so if we add artificial diversion into the Huai River? Such a major issue cannot be discussed openly and honestly with neighboring provinces to study the pros and cons. Instead, they want to act arbitrarily, only to cause disputes and delay the overall situation, which is truly regrettable. Now that the Yellow River has moved north for more than sixty years, this is precisely the opportunity to divert the Huai River into the sea. Therefore, we in Anhui are discussing the method of diverting the Huai River, wanting to unite the four provinces of Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui to discuss it together, hoping to consider the overall situation and avoid disputes between neighboring provinces. Unexpectedly, the Huai River has not yet entered the sea, but there is a malicious plan to divert the Yellow River into the Huai River, aggravating the flood disaster. The areas along the Huai River and the Yangtze River will be the first to suffer. We must resolutely contend with it, hoping to reverse the situation. Moreover, we must put ourselves in the position of those who propose diverting the Yellow River and thoroughly explain the historical lessons of the past, making a valuable argument and not just a dispute over a small area. We respectfully request your Yuan, Fu, and Associations to review this matter, approve the submitted situation, and promptly instruct the Henan Provincial Government to abolish this absurd policy of harming neighbors for one's own benefit, prevent future troubles, and reverse the situation. We respectfully appeal on behalf of tens of millions of families and await your urgent orders.) etc. (22nd)</p>

<h3>The Mayor's Speech</h3>
<p>During the banquet, Mayor Wu delivered a speech saying, "Today, I am very honored and happy to be able to gather with you all. Your trip across the ocean to study industry naturally has great significance and bears a great mission. I especially admire the spirit of your delegation and have deep feelings. Since the 19th century, the narrow nationalism of various countries has led to the abnormal development, creating a situation of open and secret struggles of world imperialism. The practical impact of this open and secret struggle is, on the one hand, the unprecedented, fierce, and tragic European War from 1914 to 1919, and on the other hand, the widespread economic panic in various countries of the world today. I believe that your delegation feels this unfortunate phenomenon of mankind more keenly than I do. However, since we are deeply caught in the whirlpool of national struggles, we should find ways to open up the situation of world disputes, strive for economic cooperation among countries, and establish future international peace on the basis of industrial peace, thereby increasing the happiness of mankind. Although some countries have not been able to correctly understand China's recent revolutionary movement and have added various obstacles, it is actually the beginning of realizing this attempt, because the foundation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Chinese revolution, is the spirit of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, peace, and the kingly way of Chinese culture for thousands of years, and Dr. Sun's (Industrial Plan) also advocates (international assistance, consolidating the fraternal love of mankind, eliminating the competitive nature of various countries, and realizing the universal harmony of China). The center of world politics and economy will undoubtedly shift from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, and the future fortune and misfortune, governance and chaos of the world will be more closely related to the countries in the Pacific Ocean. The Philippines and China are both masters in the Pacific Ocean. A large number of Chinese people reside in your country, with a long history. The commercial exchanges between us are also very frequent. Therefore, the relationship between China and the Philippines is deeper than that of other countries, whether geographically, historically, or economically. Sino-Philippine cooperation, especially Sino-Philippine commercial and economic cooperation, is naturally particularly needed, and the effect of this cooperation on the promotion of national fortune, the development of national economy, and even the maintenance of peace in the Pacific and the increase of human welfare will be infinitely great. Furthermore, this city is the center of China's economy and commerce, and it is also an important commercial port in the world, especially in the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, the economic and commercial development and prosperity of this city are directly and indirectly related to the Philippines. Fortunately, your delegation has come to our city. I hope that you will not hesitate to give us your advice, give us many instructions, and promote the development of each other's commerce and economy based on the above-mentioned meaning of cooperation. Finally, on behalf of the citizens, I express my warm welcome and wish your delegation good health and success on this trip."</p>
<h3>Delegation Members' Remarks</h3>
<p>According to MENDIMTSE, Section Chief of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce Improvement Association, to the reporter at the Astor House Hotel, (1) It is not true that Chinese goods transported to the Philippines are often hindered by the Philippines. Filipinos purchase 90 to 95 percent of Chinese goods out of foreign goods. The so-called hindrance refers to Chinese goods related to food and hygiene. This is not unique to the Philippines; any country is the same. Chinese goods exported to the Philippines reach more than three million yuan per year, while Philippine goods transported to China are very few. The purpose of this trip to China is to increase trade in the Philippines. (2) The delegation has no feelings to express about the visit to Japan, because Japan is an imperialist country that exposes its true face everywhere. (3) Foreigners entered the Philippines as early as 1521, and Chinese people entered even earlier. Therefore, the relationship between China and the Philippines has a history of more than 400 years. I sincerely hope that the original spirit will continue in the future, so that the friendship between the two sides will become more perfect and the commerce will be prosperous.</p>
<h3>Hospitality Schedule</h3>
<p>The original hospitality schedule set by the municipal government is said to have been slightly changed. In addition to today's hospitality schedule, which remains the same, including visiting the city center area, Zhabei Wusong Tongji University, and Yong'an Yarn Factory in the morning, lunch at the Guo Shun banquet of Yong'an Yarn Factory, and visiting Jiaotong University, Xujiahui Observatory, Longhua scenic spot, Longhua Cement Company, Zhanghua Woolen Mill tea party, Liu Hongsheng dinner, and the group banquet of the Bank Association, International Trade Association, Shipping Association, Money Industry Association, and Exchange Federation in the afternoon, the original plan to visit the Commodity Exhibition Hall, Securities and Textile Exchange, Bank Association, etc., yesterday will be changed to the 28th when returning to Shanghai from Beijing due to time constraints.</p>
<h3>Continued Arrival Today</h3>
<p>Along with the delegation, there are more than 40 members of the Friendship Tourist Group, totaling 75 people. Most of those who arrived in Shanghai yesterday were members of the delegation. As for the Friendship Tourist Group, they came to Shanghai from Japan aboard the President Cleveland of the Dollar Steamship Company. The ship is scheduled to enter the port at 7:00 AM today and is expected to arrive at the new Customs Wharf at about 8:30 AM.</p>
<h3>Entering Beijing Tonight</h3>
<p>The delegation will enter Beijing by night train tonight after the remaining few people arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. The reception procedure for entering Beijing has been drafted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After arriving in Beijing on the 26th, they will first visit the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Railways, and pay a visit to the Mayor of Beijing. At 1:00 PM, the Beijing Chamber of Commerce will host a banquet at the Central Hotel. In the afternoon, they will visit Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and the Sports Ground Ming Mausoleum.

<h3>The Municipal Government Sends Personnel to Beijing</h3>
<p>To Discuss the Relief of Chinese Yarn</p>
<p>Wu Huanru, Section Chief of the Social Bureau, Has Been Appointed</p>
<p>The matter of national Chinese cotton mills implementing reduced working hours was discussed twice at the Municipal Government by representatives of Party and government agencies and representatives of various cotton mills the other day. It was decided that reducing working hours was only a temporary solution. In order to seek fundamental relief, it was decided that the cotton mill industry would send representatives to Beijing to discuss relief measures with the relevant departments in charge of finance and industry. It is learned that the representatives of the cotton merchants have gone to Beijing first. The Municipal Government has also decided to send Wu Huanru, Section Chief of the Second Section of the Social Bureau, as a representative of the Municipal Government, to Beijing by night express last night to participate in the meeting.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Cotton Mill Industry Reduces Working Hours to Solve Problems</h3>
<p>Wu Zhongheng, Section Chief of the Labor Section of the Central People's Movement Committee, and Liu Yinfei, Director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Industry, went to Shanghai to discuss solutions to the reduction of working hours in cotton mills. Wu and others returned to Beijing on the morning of the 24th. On the 20th, we, together with the Shanghai Municipal Government Party Department, sent personnel to convene an informal discussion with representatives of the capitalists, Rong Zongjing, Nie Lusheng, Zhang Zemin, and Guo Shun. First, the capitalists stated the decline of the cotton industry in recent years and the reason for the inevitable reduction of working hours. However, after the reduction of working hours, although the labor side was affected, the capital side did not benefit either. It was actually due to overproduction in the hope of reducing output. The next day, banks were reconvened to discuss loan methods for various factories. More than ten people, including Lin Kanghou and Xu Xinliu, arrived. At that time, the representatives of the banking industry stated that they could help as much as possible with loans, but it would be difficult to reduce interest rates. Mayor Wu telegraphed President Wang of the Executive Yuan to convene representatives of cotton mills and relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Industry, Transportation, Railways, and Finance, and set a (25th) to discuss relief measures in Beijing. Factory representatives Rong Zongjing, Zhang Zemin, Nie Lusheng, and Guo Shun have scheduled to come to Beijing by night train on the 24th. But what the factory side is asking for is: one, to change the light freight rate; two, to ask the government to reduce or exempt various taxes; three, to ask the national bank to lend as much as possible. As for how to promote Chinese cotton cloth and not be affected by foreign goods dumping, I intend to form a joint official-merchant production and sales agency in the future, so that there is no fear of excess goods and the economy can be turned around.</p>
<h3>Weng Zhaoyuan's Troops Achieve Victory</h3>
<p>Annihilating More Than 2,000 Japanese and Puppet Soldiers</p>
<p>And Capturing More Than 20 Artillery Pieces</p>
<p>A certain organization in this port received a telegram from General Weng Zhaoyuan last night saying, "The first battalion of our troops, under the cover of artillery fire, crossed the Luan River on the afternoon of the (23rd) and attacked Lulong. At 8:00 PM, Lulong was recovered, annihilating 2,000 Japanese and puppet cavalry and infantry, and capturing more than 20 artillery pieces. The enemy is collapsing and retreating and is being pursued." It is specially published so that patriotic compatriots can rise up to help.</p>
<h3>Feng Yong Flies from Ping to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Visited the Aviation School in Hangzhou Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Discussed the Situation in North China and the Front</p>
<p>Feng Yong, the President of Feng Yong University, led the athletes of Fengda to resist Japan in the vicinity of Gubeikou this time. The other day, he took the time to return to Ping from the defense zone and flew to Shanghai on his own Red Horse plane. He arrived safely here in the evening of the other day and went to the hotel to rest. Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, he still took the Red Horse plane to Hangzhou to visit the Aviation School. The Central News Agency reporter visited Mr. Feng at the hotel yesterday morning to inquire about the recent situation on the front line and the current situation in Pingjin. He gave a detailed answer as follows:</p>
<h3>The Front Is Silent</h3>
<p>Mr. Feng first described the recent situation on the front line. According to the discussion, the front line has been unusually silent for the past few days, with no major battles. The morale of our army is very strong, but the lack of military equipment and supplies is beyond the imagination of the people in the rear. The soldiers have the heart to die, but lack the means to die. The south has many rivers, which is not conducive to the enemy's operations. The north has many plains, so the enemy's tanks, armored vehicles, artillery vehicles, and cavalry can gallop across them unimpeded. Our army not only does not have these kinds of sharp weapons to deal with the enemy, but it is also impossible to get a long-range artillery piece to resist the enemy. The enemy's planes often circled over our front line, carrying out bombing. Under this kind of situation, is it possible to drive the enemy out of the country?</p>
<h3>People Are Numb</h3>
<p>Mr. Feng continued, "Although our army's military equipment and supplies are lacking, in terms of strength, although our army cannot drive the enemy out of the country, it is not difficult to recover the lost territory of Rehe at a minimum. But at present, not only has the lost territory of Rehe not been recovered, but the various passes of the Great Wall have also fallen one after another. Why is this? I dare to tell the people of the country that this is not a matter of strength, but a matter of determination. The harassment of the 共匪 in Jiangxi and the empty talk of the Southwest, without seeing a single soldier, are all closely related to the setbacks in the anti-Japanese military affairs. Even in terms of the people, Pingjin is only a hundred li away from the front line of the war between the two countries, but the people are still bustling as usual, and the people are numb. This is a phenomenon of national subjugation. Mr. Feng then asked the reporter if Shanghai was quite peaceful. The reporter replied, "Yes, in the midst of the red lights and green wine, in the den of paper drunkards and golden fans, the people are bustling, as if they do not know that the national crisis is imminent. Is this a scene of peace or a harbinger of national subjugation?" After the words were finished, they were silent for a long time.</p>
<h3>School Relocation to the South</h3>
<p>A reporter asked Mr. Feng whether the rumor that various schools in Beiping and Tianjin would move south was true. Mr. Feng said that Jiaotong University of Tangshan had already moved to Shanghai, and other schools such as Tsinghua University, Peking University, and Normal University were also said to be planning to move south. However, could the South have suitable housing to accommodate the southward migration of various schools from Beiping and Tianjin? Instruments and books could be moved south, but could school buildings also be moved? Beiping and Tianjin were dangerous places, but who could guarantee that Beijing and Shanghai would not become like Beiping and Tianjin in the future? The various schools in Beiping and Tianjin were following the ancient artifacts of the Palace Museum in moving south. However, could the national territory of Beiping and Tianjin also be moved south? The actions of the intellectual class were such, which was truly heartbreaking.</p>
<h3>Flew to Hangzhou Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Mr. Feng said at the end that he had originally planned to go to Guangzhou after arriving in Shanghai this time. However, his trip to Guangzhou had been canceled, and he would fly to Hangzhou in the afternoon today to visit the aviation school and see his classmate, Feng Da, who was studying there. The date of his return to the north was not yet determined.</p>
<h3>National Aviation Salvation Movement by All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association announced the eighth raffle of the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association's fundraising committee for national salvation through aviation. Yesterday, the committee held a meeting and decided to hold the eighth raffle at 5:00 PM on the 25th of this month and set the 5th of next month as the final raffle to conclude the event. Regarding the results of each team, apart from those occasionally submitted in the local area, those from other areas had not yet been collected due to the inconvenience of remittance. Therefore, the chief commander, Yu Qiaqing, sent a letter urging active participation to achieve the goal. The letter to each team leader is recorded below: Respectfully informing you, the fundraising raffle of this association has been held seven times. Examining the results of various ports, many have already submitted, but there are also many that have been delayed. This is due to the remoteness of mountains and rivers and the lack of means to submit. It is decided to hold the eighth raffle on the 25th of this month, and at the same time, a committee meeting will be convened. Please expedite the remittance of the funds raised to the association in advance for public announcement, etc. It is believed that the people of the hometown are enthusiastic about saving the country, and tomorrow's raffle will surely have special results.</p>
<h3>Colleagues from Two Railways Allocate Public Reserve Funds</h3>
<p>The Special Party Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways initiated and, together with the two railway administrations and labor unions, organized the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Air Defense Fundraising Committee. The first committee meeting decided to raise 150,000 silver dollars. The second committee meeting decided on four fundraising methods, the second of which was to allocate 35,000 yuan from the 2% interest on pension funds and public reserve funds. The existing pension fund and public reserve fund had more than 88,000 yuan, and allocating 35,000 yuan, about one-third of the total amount, would not hinder the fund. All committee members deeply supported this move. However, in order to respect the public opinion of colleagues, although there were 23 detailed rules for handling public welfare matters for railway employees with public reserve funds, which could be implemented with the approval of all committee members, it was still planned to solicit consent first before implementation. Therefore, it was decided to notify colleagues, asking everyone to conscientiously make a decision on whether to approve this method by signing the attached note and returning it to the association before April 30. Those who failed to do so by the deadline would be considered to have approved. On May 1 at 3:00 PM, the committee would hold another meeting to publicly announce the decision on whether to allocate the funds based on the majority vote.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador Will Go to Beijing to Present Credentials</h3>
<p>Yesterday, staff were sent to the Foreign Affairs Office of the Municipal Government to thank them for their hospitality.</p>
<p>Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, Mr. Bogomolov, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Zhao Tiezhang, Acting Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Office in Shanghai, and Tang Shixuan, representative of Mayor Wu, welcomed him and took care of everything. Yesterday, Ambassador Bogomolov specially sent Hanwen Counsellor E Shanyin to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Office in Shanghai and the Municipal Government at around 10:00 AM to thank them for their welcome and care. Ambassador Bogomolov is scheduled to go to Beijing this week to contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to arrange the date for presenting his credentials. All notes and copies of credentials will be sent directly to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Stating that Japan still holds a policy of wait-and-see.</p>
<p>Direct negotiations are not possible.</p>
<p>Japanese Minister to China, Akira Ariyoshi, took leave last month to return to his country to mourn his mother and report everything to the Japanese government. He has now completed his public duties and returned to his post on the 22nd, accompanied by his wife, Secretary Okazaki, Director of the Information Bureau Suma, etc., on the Nagasaki Maru. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Yangshupu Huishan Wharf. When the Japanese ambassador landed, security around the wharf was extremely tight. When the Japanese ambassador met with the Japanese press corps yesterday, he stated that he had discussed the current diplomatic policy towards China with the government authorities during his return to the country. They all advocated a temporary policy of wait-and-see. Regarding the general situation in China today, direct Sino-Japanese negotiations were not possible. There was no solution except to hold a wait-and-see attitude and wait for opportunities. However, we should all work hard to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute as soon as possible. He would adhere to the government's policy, so he would not go to Beijing for the time being after returning to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>British Aviator Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that Sir Herkents Irvey, a leading British aviator and chairman of the board of directors of various aircraft companies in the Roehm-Amster-Schluttly system, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning (23rd) on the Empress of Japan. According to Herkents, he was here to investigate the special situation of aviation in China in order to determine the most suitable type of aircraft for Chinese aviation. The various companies in the system were the largest aircraft manufacturers in the United Kingdom, and several of the aircraft they manufactured were the most sophisticated in the world and could be suitable for various purposes. He was accompanied by Colonel Tom Hill, former military attaché of the British Legation, as a consultant.</p>
<h3>Facts of the Xin Renhe Steamer Homicide Case at the Time</h3>
<p>Originated from the elimination of evil</p>
<p>The deceased was actually a member of a gang of thieves.</p>
<p>Newspaper reports are not the truth.</p>
<p>Lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Peng Yuanxun sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, which read: To the Shen Bao Newspaper Office, according to the Yu Xing Steamship Company, the client, the newspaper published an article in the local news section on the 20th of this month regarding the Xin Renhe steamer owned by the Yu Xing Company, which said that a peddler was murdered with cruel means. The article stated that the steamer was carrying drugs and suspected that the peddler had informed the authorities, so the steamer bore a grudge and beat the peddler to death and threw the body into the river. The article did not match what happened during the actual event. The company has made an investigation to discover a different version of the incident. We are sending a copy of this version. Please use your platform to correct the mistake and state the truth. The lawyers double checked the facts. The relevant officials and public opinions are all available. The incident was due to the elimination of evil and public rage. This is very different from what was stated in the newspaper. Please investigate and correct the error. Yours truly, Lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Peng Yuanxun, April 24th.</p>
<p>The Yu Xing Company publicly stated: There have always been many thieves on the Shensha shipping route, and they mix with other passengers on various ships, harming travelers. Merchants have long hated them. The company has repeatedly tried to find ways to ban them, but the gang of thieves is large and arrogant. If the crew members interfere slightly, they will be beaten. The unarmed merchants dared not compete with these fierce thugs. Therefore, this kind of evil atmosphere has become an incurable disease. This is the real situation of the suffering that the colleagues on the Shensha route have always suffered. On the 12th of this month, when a couple from Chongming boarded the Xin Renhe steamer from Shanghai to Sha at Zhihaihong Port, a thief took advantage of the chaos and stole more than 30 silver dollars from their pockets. The wife discovered it at the time and told her husband, who negotiated with the thief and cried and begged for the money to be returned. However, the thief not only did not show mercy but also punched her husband, knocking out two front teeth, causing his mouth to bleed. It happened to be seen by sailor Huang Afu, who angrily intervened. Unexpectedly, the gang of thieves was extremely fierce and wanted to beat him in groups. The sailor, seeing that he was outnumbered, stopped. In the evening, the sailors were supposed to sweep the cabins. The gang of thieves deliberately provoked trouble again, from verbal disputes to physical violence, and broke the sailor's tendons, causing him to be covered in bruises. At that time, all the passengers on the ship felt injustice and rose up to help fight. They tied up the thieves and insisted on severely punishing them because the thieves had always harassed merchants and travelers. So they tied the five thieves to the railings of the third deck, ready to send them to the water police station for handling. Unexpectedly, one of them had already broken the rope and jumped into a sampan to escape. However, due to jumping from a high place, he lost his footing and fell into the water. The crew members noticed it and ordered the sampan to rescue him. At that time, the passengers on the ship all shouted that he was a thief, whose evil deeds were full, and his death was not a pity. They prevented the rescue, and the order became chaotic. The shipowner, Sun Xingsheng, secretly ordered the boat to be rowed to rescue him. By the time he was rescued, he had been filled with seawater and suffocated to death. At that time, the people on the ship were extremely frightened when they saw that a human life had been lost. At that time, someone proposed that it would be better to throw the remaining four thieves into the sea to eliminate the evidence. The masses had shallow wisdom and agreed with each other, and this tragedy occurred. It was indeed unfortunate. This is the true situation of what happened that day, without any concealment or addition. The reports in the newspapers of this city, that the company secretly transported a large batch of drugs from Haimen to Shanghai for sale in March, which was seized by the Shanghai police, and suspected that Ma Koushi and others, peddlers on the ship, had informed the authorities, leading to revenge and this tragedy, were purely untrue. The time was not far away, and the military and police agencies were nearby, so it was not difficult to verify. Moreover, Ma Koushi and others were not peddlers on the ship. They were famous habitual thieves, and colleagues on the Shensha route generally knew this. Once investigated, it would not be difficult to understand. The matter concerned the truth, so it was inconvenient to remain silent. In short, the company had never dreamed that this unfortunate incident would happen, and it was infinitely regrettable. The truth of the matter was there, and the truth would come to light. A brief summary is provided, hoping for public judgment.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute Incidents</h3>
<p>(Guohua Silk Factory) The Guohua Silk Weaving Factory in Dongbazijiao, Yokohama Road, Zhabei, has a total of more than 170 male and female workers, specializing in weaving mao ge and anda crepe. The original wages were 3 cents and 3 li per foot for mao ge and 3 cents and 7 li per foot for anda crepe. Since the September 18th Incident last year, the factory reduced the original wages slightly due to sluggish business. Mao ge was reduced to 2 cents and 3 li per foot, and anda crepe was changed to 3 cents per foot. The workers did not argue due to economic pressure and the current situation. Until this year, the workers had repeatedly requested the factory to restore the reduced wages, but the factory did not agree. At the same time, since September last year, the factory deducted 2% from each worker's salary as a national salvation fund. The workers were happy to comply because the country was in difficulty and citizens should do their best. Unexpectedly, recently, the factory donated 100 yuan to aviation salvation on its own without the consent of the workers, and forced the workers to fill out an unreasonable form, which aroused the opposition of all the workers. They completely went on strike yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, and at 3:00 PM, they sent representatives Wang Xianyao, Zhu Chengtai, Zhang Yihe, Ren Yijing, Jiang Qixiang, Chen Yutai, Zhang De, and others to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, requesting mediation. Wang Xianqing, Director of the Mediation Section, received them and said that a detailed written submission must be submitted to the bureau, and staff would be sent to investigate thoroughly. He believed that reckless strikes were inappropriate and ordered the workers to resume work immediately and wait quietly for mediation.</p>
<h3>Tianyi Silk Factory</h3>
<p>The Tianyi Silk Weaving Factory at No. 258 Zhengsheng Road, Tilanqiao, has a total of more than 250 male and female workers, specializing in weaving Huarong ge, double crepe, single crepe, and Parisian silk. The original wages were 9.5 cents per yard for Huarong ge, 7 cents per yard for double crepe, 6.5 cents per yard for single crepe, and 10 cents per yard for Parisian silk. On the 4th of this month, the factory announced that the wages of all long-term workers would be calculated at 80% of the original wages, the wages of preparatory workers would be calculated at 90%, and the subsidy of 5 jiao per person per day for warp and weft would be canceled, as well as the old practice of a hard work bonus of 1 yuan per person per month. On the 6th, it was immediately implemented, which aroused the opposition of all the workers. At 3:20 PM yesterday afternoon, they sent representatives Chen Jixiang and others to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, requesting a stop. Wang Xianqing, Director of the Mediation Section, received them and promised to summon them for mediation after investigation.</p>
<h3>Huashun Rubber Factory</h3>
<p>The Huashun Rubber Factory in Yaoqiaohang, southwest of Shanghai, announced the temporary suspension of business on the 9th of this month, and it had not yet resumed work as of yesterday, causing panic among the workers regarding their livelihood. They sent people to the factory to request the factory to take care of the workers' livelihood and resume work as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, the factory refused. The workers sent representatives Qiu Zemin and others to the Municipal Party Department to petition, requesting that the factory be ordered to resume work immediately. Zhou Lianze, General Secretary of the Civil Training Section, received them and promised to handle it together with the Social Affairs Bureau. They then went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, and Wang Xianqing, Director of the Mediation Section, received them and promised to handle it after requesting instructions.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Tobacco Factory</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Tobacco Factory notified on the 17th of this month that 15 workers, including Wu Shiyuan and Zhang Chong, were fired. All the workers rose up in opposition and petitioned the Party and government agencies. In order to avoid the expansion of the dispute, the Party and government agencies specially summoned both labor and management to the Social Affairs Bureau for questioning at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Hu Menglin and Wu Shiyuan represented labor, Liang Zhenqing and Tu Zhezhen represented management, and Zhang Sheng represented the Municipal Party Department. Wang Xianqing, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, presided over the meeting. First, the labor representatives stated that there was no reason for firing the workers and that all 35 dismissed workers should be allowed to return to work completely. Then, the management representatives stated that at the end of last year, some workers said that the accounts were unclear and the foreman Li Hui was suspected of embezzling bonuses. The manager had asked accountant Xu Yongzuo to review the accounts. The chairman then stated that labor and management should cooperate as much as possible, which was the right way. In the past, the Nanyang Tobacco Factory had experienced several twists and turns. Fortunately, it had turned from danger to safety. The bureau hoped that the factory would allow the 15 workers to return to work. The management representatives promised to convey this intention to the manager. It is now heard that the Party and government agencies have decided to formally mediate the matter.</p>
<h3>Japanese-Owned Spinning Mills Also Reduced Work Hours Starting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Counting Gongda, Datonghua, and other 10 factories</p>
<p>The methods of reducing work hours are not consistent.</p>
<p>Chinese-owned spinning mills have announced a 23% reduction in work hours starting from the 22nd of this month to maintain operations due to the impact of the sharp drop in yarn prices and the decline in business. It is now learned that ten Japanese-owned spinning mills in this city have also taken the same attitude as the Chinese-owned spinning mills and have all announced the implementation of work hour reductions starting yesterday (24th) due to the impact of the yarn market slump. The reporter of Dagong News Agency obtained details from various sources and recorded them as follows:</p>
<h3>Sharp Drop in Japanese Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>According to news from the Japanese textile industry, yarn prices have plummeted in recent years due to the global economic downturn, which has not only severely hit Chinese-owned spinning mills but also caused various losses to Japanese-owned spinning mills. The sales markets for Japanese yarn have always been India, Southeast Asia, and various inland provinces of China. However, recently, due to the poor economic conditions and reduced purchasing power in various places, few people have inquired about Japanese yarn, resulting in huge losses due to current yarn inventories. In view of this situation, which is enough to lead to destruction, the Japanese yarn mills convened a joint meeting of ten Japanese yarn mills, including Toyota, Dakang, Tongxing, Neiwaimian, Donghua, Rihua, Yufeng, Huafeng, Gongda, and Shanghai, to discuss remedial measures. The result of the meeting was to implement work hour reductions to reduce production and maintain the status quo.</p>
<h3>Work Hour Reductions in Various Factories</h3>
<p>After the Japanese yarn mills decided to reduce work hours, several factories, including Donghua, Gongda, Dakang, and Tongxing, had already started implementing the reductions as early as last Saturday. By yesterday (24th), Monday, several factories, including Toyota, Rihua, and Huafeng, also announced work hour reductions one after another. Therefore, as of yesterday, all ten Japanese yarn mills had implemented work hour reductions. However, the methods of reducing work hours in various factories were not consistent. Some factories reduced work hours by one or two hours per day, while others reduced the number of day and night shifts on Saturdays and Sundays. The investigations are listed separately as follows: (1) Yufeng: stopped day and night shifts on Sundays; (2) Rihua: reduced work hours by three hours and stopped work on Sundays; (3) Huafeng: the same as Rihua Factory; (4) Shanghai: stopped work on Sundays; (5) Donghua: the first workshop was completely stopped, and the second workshop reduced work hours by five hours; (6) Neiwaimian: the yarn-making room was completely stopped, and both Saturdays and Sundays were stopped; (7) Toyota: reduced work hours by two hours; (8) Gongda: the yarn-making room reduced work hours by three hours and was completely stopped on Sundays; (9) Dakang: stopped day and night shifts on Sundays; (10) Tongxing: reduced work hours by two hours.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Railways Invited Silk and Yarn Industries to Discuss Transportation and Adjustment Measures</h3>
<p>Yu Yan held a tea party with representatives of the two industries yesterday.</p>
<p>The government and all sectors are very concerned about the work hour reduction incident in Chinese-owned spinning mills. The occurrence of this incident is enough to prove that the trend of global economic downturn has spread to the banks of the Huangpu River and threatens the life of China's social economy. The Ministry of Railways believes that the unsalable sales of Chinese yarn are closely related to the purpose of railway transportation adjustment. It has specially sent Yu Yan, Director of the Business Department, to Shanghai to solicit opinions from representatives of the silk and yarn industries at the Huaan Hotel at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss relief measures. Rong Zongjing, Nie Lusheng, Xu Jingren, Xu Fantang, and other representatives of the yarn industry, as well as Shen Huachen, Zhu Jingan, Huang Jinfan, and other representatives of the silk industry, attended, and they were received by Director Yu and Huang Baiqiao, Wu Shaozeng, Zheng Baozhao, and other directors and deputy directors of the two railways. The report of Director Yu and the opinions of the two industries are described below:</p>
<h3>Yu Yan's Report</h3>
<p>The yarn and cloth industry has decided to reduce work hours to maintain operations due to sluggish business and overproduction. Representatives have been sent to Beijing to consult with the authorities and discuss relief. Minister Gu of the Ministry of Railways believes that the railway authorities are also responsible for the decline of industry and commerce in its cost calculation. Therefore, without waiting for you to come from afar, I have been specially sent here to consult and hope that you will explain in detail the pain you have suffered and the hope for how to reduce railway freight rates. I will try to find a way as soon as possible to reduce the pain of various industries.</p>
<h3>Opinions of the Yarn Industry</h3>
<p>After Director Yu finished his report, he asked Rong Zongjing and Nie Lusheng, representatives of the yarn industry, to express their opinions. They said that four-tenths of the raw materials for China's yarn industry are taken from New York in the United States and Mumbai in India. Domestic raw materials are collected from Shandong and Shaanxi, Hunan, and other provinces. However, due to freight rates, most of them are transported by water, and the freight is 30% more expensive than transporting them from abroad. For example, from Shaanxi to Luoyang to here, it costs more than 3 yuan per load, while transporting it from the United States and India to Shanghai costs less than 2 yuan. Moreover, there are measures to return 30% of the water freight to their domestic merchants as preferential treatment. Furthermore, Japanese merchants can also obtain various preferential treatments on the Jiaoji Railway or by Japanese shipping, so they can compete with Chinese merchants with superior strength. China has a large population, and the need for food and clothing is huge. In terms of yarn and cloth, even if there are tens of millions of yarn spindles, it is not enough. Now there are only more than 2 million spindles, and some factories have stopped work due to the decline in business. If this continues, I am afraid it will decrease even more. As for Japanese yarn factories in China, the situation is the opposite. From 400,000 yarn spindles in 1912, it has now increased to more than 2 million spindles and is still developing. It will completely seize the national yarn market. Therefore, I hope that (1) the railway authorities can closely contact the yarn merchants; (2) they can follow the return water method and return 30%; (3) the railway can guide farmers along the line to plant cotton, which can increase 2 million loads annually, which can also reduce a leakage of 10 million yuan. However, the most important thing is to reduce freight rates.</p>
<h3>Opinions of the Silk Industry</h3>
<p>Then, Shen Huachen, a representative of the silk industry, expressed his opinion, saying that silk cocoons are a specialty of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Although Anhui and Jiangxi also produce them, the number is small. Shanghai silk merchants obtain silk cocoons from Zhejiang Province, and Wuxi obtains them from Jiangsu Province. Therefore, their relationship with the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways is closer. The two railways do not have much military transportation, so they suffer less. However, the freight rates are too high. Therefore, in recent years, they have changed to water transportation. Although it takes longer, it is unavoidable in order to reduce costs. Zhejiang Province has cocoon areas and silk areas. If the cocoon prices are low, they will spin cocoon silk, etc. However, China's silk is mainly exported. If the spinning increases, the exports will decrease, which is greatly related to the national economy and people's livelihood. In the past, silk cocoon exports were about 60,000 packages, worth 10 million yuan. Last year, it fell sharply to 18,000 packages. As for silk cocoon freight, from Wuxi to Shanghai, it is discounted by 30% due to water competition, while from Zhexieqiao to Shanghai, it is collected at the actual price. Although the merchants have requested the reduction of prices, it has not been approved. Moreover, due to the congestion of vehicles, or even being stranded at the station for many days, they are subject to extortion and losses. Now, responsible transportation is being organized, which can eliminate this pain. It is hoped that more vehicles will be dispatched during the cocoon season to transport them as soon as possible. Director Yu accepted it and Zheng Baozhao, Director of the Car Service Department, explained it in detail, asking them to send personnel to contact the bureau before the cocoon season.</p>
<h3>The Railway Exhibition Closed</h3>
<p>The Railway Exhibition of Products from Along the Railway Line has attracted much attention from people from all walks of life since it opened on the 10th of this month. The exhibition was originally scheduled for three weeks and will close on the 30th of this month. Now, many people from all walks of life have traveled from afar to visit the exhibition. However, the closing date is too early, and some people may regret not being able to attend. It has been decided to extend the exhibition for ten days and hold the closing ceremony on May 10, so that people from all walks of life can fully refer to and study it.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Representatives to the Geneva International Labor Conference Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Geneva International Labor Conference is about to open in the near future. All related countries have sent representatives to attend and participate. China has previously sent Yan Qingxiang and others to attend. The Japanese government has also sent Akamatsu Koiwa, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, to lead the delegation, including Dr. Watanabe Tetsuzo, Director of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry representing employers, and Sakamoto Kozo Saburo, Executive Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Japan Federation of Labor representing labor, to Europe.

It is reported that Akamatsu and others will stay in Shanghai overnight and take the original ship to Europe at 9:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Various Trade Associations Petitioned to Stop the Telephone Price Increase</h3>
<p>Notifying members to temporarily pay the increased telephone bills pending resolution.</p>
<p>The Silk Mercerie Industry, Fruit and Local Products Industry, Ginseng, Bird's Nest, Seafood Sundries Industry, Measurement and Weighing Instruments Industry, Sugar Industry, Jute Bag Industry, and Sauce and Wine Business Industry of this city, together with more than 30 trade associations, summoned leaders of various industries to a meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on Sanma Road because they read in the newspaper that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau would increase the monthly fee for business users to 10 yuan starting from May 1. They all believed that the Bureau's installation of automatic machinery to reduce employees, according to common sense, would save consumption or reduce monthly fees to benefit users. However, now it has not only not decreased but has actually increased by 66.7%, which is unbearable for the business community. It was decided that (1) a petition should be submitted to the Ministry of Communications to strictly order a stop; (2) a letter should be sent to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to cancel the previous resolution and restore the old price; (3) various industry associations should notify their members to temporarily withhold the increased telephone fees before the matter is resolved, so as to promote the authorities' awareness. The petition and notification are excerpted as follows:</p>
<h3>Petition to the Ministry of Communications</h3>
<p>Petition for seeking the Ministry's assistance in stopping Shanghai Telephone Bureau from raising prices. As telephone is one of the public services, its development can be seen as a sign of the prosperity or decline of industry and commerce. Shanghai, because of the concession, has formed an abnormal development where the north and south cities are quite different in size. The number of users of telephones only reaches 3,000, which is only one tenth of the users in the concession. Fortunately, the cost of service is relatively low, and merchants can barely shoulder it. It has been heard that the Bureau installed automatic machineries to reduce the need for employees, which makes sense since the installation would reduce the operating costs and consequently bring about a reduction in the monthly fee to benefit the users. However, no sooner had the installation been completed than it was planned to raise the price, increasing the fee to 66.7% for commercial users. By focusing solely on profits, it is ignoring the difficulties of businesses. Since January 28th, the loss of industry and commerce in the North and South cities has been great, and they haven't recovered by even one ten-thousandth. While our government has no time to provide relief, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, controlled by your Ministry, is ignoring everything and implementing the price increase, which is rare. The Associations have reported and asked to oppose the measure. The situation described above is reported with the purpose of gaining assistance from your Ministry so that you can quickly order the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to stop the price increase.</p>
<h3>Member Notice</h3>
<p>Respectfully informing, lately reading in the newspapers, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, starting from May 1st, will increase the cost of business telephones to a staggering ten yuan per month, only seeking private gain, disregarding the difficulties of businesses, this is outrageous. Our association, etc., has repeatedly received requests for relief from members, and has already jointly petitioned the Ministry of Transportation with various industry associations to strictly order a halt. Before a resolution is reached, we hope you will instruct your association's members in both the northern and southern city areas to temporarily withhold the increased telephone fees, to prompt the authorities to realize and achieve the effect of unity, this is essential. Wishing you well.</p>

<h3>Reading the Annual Report of the Chinese Cotton Mill Association</h3>
<p>At this time of promoting domestic goods and resisting foreign goods, the cotton mill industry occupies an important position. However, since the previous year, there have been the September 18th and January 28th incidents externally, and major floods and bandit disasters in various places internally. The cotton mill industry has suffered the most. Moreover, as the world economic panic is becoming increasingly acute, industrialized countries around the world are vying to dump their surplus goods in our country's market. Therefore, our cotton mill industry is the first to bear the brunt. It is more difficult for them to support and resist and strive for survival than other industries. Today, reading the annual report of the Chinese Cotton Mill Association for the 22nd year, the (1) recent situation of the textile industry, (2) supply and demand of raw cotton, (3) cotton tax and yarn tax, (4) textile education, (5) national crisis and the cotton industry, (6) business difficulties and relief of cotton mills, (7) cotton industry statistics, (8) this association in the past two years, although the words are simple, the meaning is comprehensive, and it can be understood at a glance.

However, those who have achieved such results know that the leaders of the association have put in a lot of effort and perseverance. The cotton industry is the most important thing in life. All depend on the gentlemen of the industry, in this situation of decline of all industries, even if it is extremely difficult and dangerous, they do not lose heart, and even if they fail again and again, they do not lose heart, advancing and retreating, and finally there will be a day of revival. This is not only what the gentlemen of the industry should work hard for, but also what all members of society should help with wholeheartedly.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhiyun's Stock Mortgage Dispute</h3>

<h3>Through Joint Transportation Between Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou</h3>
<p>Negotiations Completed</p>
<p>Implementation to Begin in November</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways is handling the joint transportation between Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou, and other routes, purchasing ferries to transport trains across the Yangtze River, and will begin implementation in November. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration has specially dispatched Zheng Baozhao, the Director of the Transportation Department, to Pukou to negotiate various cooperative measures with the Tianjin-Pukou authorities. He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his duties. According to what he told reporters, there are a total of seven joint transport trains, with six trains operating in rotation and one train reserved for repairs. The allocation method is that the Tianjin-Pukou Railway will provide five trains, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway will provide one train, and the Beining Railway will provide one train. The travel time from Shanghai to Beijing is seven hours, and the ferry crossing to Ping is approximately thirty-six hours, totaling less than two days and nights. This saves time and avoids the various transfer hassles of crossing the river, making it very convenient for passengers and merchants. The payment methods between the routes have also been negotiated and will be implemented according to the established practices of each route. All expenses for the Nanjing joint transport station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway will be shared equally by all routes.</p>
<h3>Murder Case on Chang'an Road</h3>
<p>Paramour Driven by Jealousy Commits Heinous Act</p>
<p>Mother Dead, Daughter Injured, Perpetrator Self-Inflicts Fatal Wound</p>
<p>At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, a murder case occurred on Chang'an Road in Zhabei. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Taking His Brother's Widow as Wife</p>
<p>Wu Zhaoxi, 39 years old, from Funing, resided at No. 2, North Furen Lane, Chang'an Road, Zhabei. He worked as a laborer at the Pudong warehouse of the Anxing Foreign Firm, leaving early in the morning and returning late at night, as was his usual routine. There were three brothers in his family, Wu being the eldest. Both of his younger brothers had passed away, leaving behind his younger brother's widow, Zhu, and his niece, Xiaomaotou. Zhu, 26 years old, worked in a nearby sock factory to make a living. Recently, the landlord of the house saw that Wu Zhaoxi lacked a wife and that Zhu was a widow. The landlord mediated between the two, and Zhu remarried to Zhaoxi, starting cohabitation on January 28th of this year.</p>
<h3>Paramour Lays a Murderous Hand</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, Zhu had become acquainted with Li Siheshang, who lived in the adjacent room, while working at the sock factory. They had been secretly having an affair for some time. However, after marrying Zhaoxi, Zhu became more self-respecting and gradually distanced herself from Li Siheshang. This ignited Li Si's jealousy. When Zhaoxi went to work at the warehouse yesterday morning, Li broke into Zhu's room with a hatchet. Upon seeing each other, they exchanged a few words, and Li immediately attacked the mother and daughter with the hatchet several times before fleeing the scene.</p>
<h3>Flees the Scene and Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>The argument was overheard by neighbors, who then heard cries for help. They gathered outside the door and saw Li Si covered in blood, holding the hatchet, rushing down the stairs. Realizing something was wrong, the residents stopped him and questioned him. In a moment of panic, Li used the hatchet to strike his own head, immediately falling to the ground. Upon seeing this, the landlord, Zhou Liu, rushed to the nearby police station to report the incident to the Second Sub-station of the Fourth District. The station chief dispatched patrol officers to investigate the scene.</p>
<h3>Mother Dead and Daughter is in Critical Condition</h3>
<p>Li Siheshang was found lying on the ground, barely breathing, with blood flowing profusely. Zhu was found lying on the floor of her room, with seven wounds to her head, face, and wrists. Xiaomaotou had eight wounds to her hands, feet, and back. The scene was covered in blood. The officers rushed the injured mother and daughter, along with the assailant, to Pushan Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, Zhu succumbed to her injuries and died en route. The court was notified to perform an autopsy immediately. Her daughter, Xiaomaotou, was then transferred to Baolong Hospital on Baker Road. Her condition is reportedly critical. The assailant, Li Siheshang, is also in critical condition.</p>
<h3>Detective Fights with Robbers on Zha Pu Road</h3>
<p>A Foreigner is Struck by a Stray Bullet</p>
<p>Only One of Six Robbers is Captured</p>
<h3>A Lot of Visitors to Zhaofeng Park</h3>
<p>More Than 20,000 Visitors on Sunday</p>
<p>Last Sunday, April 23rd, the weather was clear and mild. Zhaofeng Park had a large number of visitors, exceeding all previous records. A total of 20,980 people visited the park that day. The previous record was on May 29, 1932, with 15,327 people. The next highest was on May 31, 1931, with 13,293 people.</p>
<p>At around 8:00 PM last night, six robbers suddenly entered No. 294 Zha Pu Road, each carrying a pistol. They first warned everyone to remain silent and sent three robbers to guard the downstairs area and the main entrance. The other three robbers then began searching the premises, leaving with their loot after about half an hour. At this time, the patrol division of the Municipal Council had received a report of the robbery and dispatched police cars and a large number of detectives. As the robbers were about to flee, they saw the detectives and, realizing that escape was difficult, opened fire. The detectives returned fire, and bullets flew in all directions, causing pedestrians to scatter. One robber was shot down by the detectives. The remaining robbers panicked and fled in different directions.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Arrests a Large Number of Communists</h3>
<p>Many Are Important Members of the Communist Party</p>
<p>Including One Person Named Wang Yimin, Who Is From Annam</p>
<p>Over Four Hundred Types of Communist Books Confiscated</p>
<p>Communist members, who have been lurking in the city and establishing secret organizations in an attempt to incite riots, have been repeatedly investigated and arrested by the military and police of both the Chinese and foreign concessions. However, the roots are not easily eradicated, and the embers threaten to reignite. Recently, the police authorities of the Public Concession received a tip-off that Li Tianming, a former Chinese police officer from Jinan, Shandong, had joined the Communist Party and was holding an important position. They ordered detectives to conduct a strict investigation. On the evening of the 6th of this month, Li Tianming was arrested. This led to a further development, and arrests were made successively at No. 70 Hongyuan Lane, Huade Road, No. 931 Xiangshou Lane, Donghan Bili Road, No. 6 Shenyu Lane, Tiantong Road, No. 261 Jun'an Lane, Tongzhou Road, Room 48 of the Daxin Hotel, Fuzhou Road, and No. 340 Heda Lane, Shanzhong Road, in the French Concession. Male and female accomplices, including Zhu Zhijiang from Hubei, Zhu Chenshi, Li Jiangshi from Sichuan, Chen Zijian, Su Yanqiu, Lei Xun, He Benzhen, Zhou Houfeng, Yang Shouren from Hunan, Li Zhiqi (Li Zimin), Luo Yizhi (Yongsheng), Wang Zhiping (Wang Wanbang), Hu Qi (Hu Jiangbao) from Fujian, Zhang Xinhua from Guangdong, and Wang Yimin from Annam, were arrested. All of them were young. A large number of communist books were seized from these locations, filling three large green cloth-covered boxes, a suitcase, and a rattan basket. It is estimated that there were more than 420 types of books. Among the most notable were *Outline of the Red Army*, *Draft of Red Army Work*, *History of the Development of the Red Army*, *Table of the Strength of the Red Army in Various Provinces Before May 1932*, *Military Report of Sichuan*, *Report on the Organization of the Sichuan Army*, *Table of the Strength of the White Army Suppressing the Communists*, *New Recruitment of the 19th Route Army (Table of Strength of the Brigade)*, *Statistics of the Guangdong Army and Navy*, *Table of the National Army Suppressing the Communists and Table of Strength*, *Table of Chinese Army and Navy Commanders*, *Complete List of Public Concession and French Concession Public Security Bureau Police Personnel*, *Complete List of Municipal Government Security Team Soldiers*, *List of Nanjing Patrol Police*, *Table of the Strength of the First Army of Guangdong*, *Record of the Five-Province Bandit Suppression Meeting*, and dozens of other types of books. The *Record of the Five-Province Bandit Suppression Meeting*, which concerned the military operations of the bandit suppression in Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Fujian, and Guangdong, was particularly significant. Some say that the National Army has spent hundreds of thousands of troops on bandit suppression in recent years with little success, perhaps because the plans for the suppression meeting were illegally obtained by the Communist Party, resulting in the leakage of military secrets. According to investigations by the police, Li Tianming and Zhu Zhijiang both held positions as members of the Pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Executive Committee and Pseudo-Military Committee. Yang Shouren also held a position as a member of the Pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Executive Committee. Li Zhiqi and Chen Zijian both held positions as members of the Pseudo-Central Executive Committee, with Li concurrently serving as a member of the Military Committee and Chen concurrently serving as the Traffic Committee member of the Military Committee. Zhu Chenshi, one of the female bandits, is Zhu Zhijiang's wife. Li Jiangshi is Li Zhiqi's wife, and at only nineteen years old, she is the youngest among the arrested bandits. Except for Wang Yimin, who is from Annam and will be handed over to the French Concession police to be questioned by the French Consul, the remaining fifteen male and female suspects have been repeatedly brought to the High Second Branch Court for interrogation. Initially, due to the importance of the case and the ongoing investigation, the authorities prohibited announcements. Now that all secret organizations have been searched and most of the party members, except for those who have already fled, have been arrested, the ban has been implicitly lifted. Yesterday afternoon, the police sent the group of criminals and the anti-government documents to the High Second Branch Court and transferred Wang Yimin, who had been detained in the French Concession police station, to the court. The presiding judge of the Criminal Division, Yu Ye, and judges Zhao Zhengtang and Jiang Shuzi, as well as the prosecutor and clerk, heard the case. The Municipal Council's lawyer, Gan Jingxian, stated that the Municipal Council had decided to formally file a complaint in this case and requested a postponement to submit the indictment and schedule another hearing. However, since Wang Yimin had been brought to court, he requested that Wang's relationship with Li Tianming be investigated first. Judge Yu then questioned Wang, but the suspect only spoke Annamese. His Annamese was first translated into French, then English, and finally Chinese. According to his testimony, he lived with Li Tianming and was introduced by a fellow party member. He initially did not know that Li was a communist until Li read communist books to him, and he learned that he was also a comrade. Li paid the rent for the room. The books found that were in French belonged to him, while the books in English belonged to the fellow party member who introduced him to Li. The books in Chinese belonged to Li. Li Tianming then testified that Wang Yimin was introduced to him by a Cantonese friend. He only knew that Wang was from Chaozhou, Guangdong, and they had been living together for more than a month. Since they were living together, he paid the rent when he had money. He denied being a member of the Communist Party and did not admit to knowing that Wang was a communist. After reviewing the testimonies, Judge Yu ordered a postponement for further questioning. The suspects were taken away separately for detention. Although a special commissioner from the Municipal Public Security Bureau went to the court to request a transfer, this issue will be decided at the formal hearing.</p>
<p>The detectives captured the injured robber and brought him back to the police station. Due to his serious injuries, he was first sent to the hospital for treatment and will be interrogated after he recovers. Meanwhile, detectives were dispatched to pursue his accomplices. However, during the fight between the detectives and the robbers, a passerby was hit by a stray bullet and injured in the chest. He fell to the side of the road and was rushed to Renji Hospital by the detectives. His injuries are reportedly serious. It was later learned that the man's name was Wang Yi Wu, 20 years old, from Huzhou. He lived in Dexin Lane, Peng Road, and worked as a pattern maker at the Wuhe Foreign Firm on Yuanmingyuan Road.</p>
<h3>Looters from Maoshan Come to Shanghai to Plot Unlawful Activities</h3>
<p>Lingering on the Old Wusong Platform</p>
<p>Exhaustively Pursued and Captured by Patrol Officers</p>
<p>At around 10:30 PM the night before last, patrol officers Deng Fuzhen and Chen Shengxuan, dispatched by the Fifth District Public Security Bureau of Zhabei, were patrolling the old Wusong platform when they saw a group of people dressed in blue cloth jackets and pants lingering near the North Station platform. Suspecting their behavior, the patrol officers approached them for questioning. However, the person gave evasive answers and turned to flee. The officers immediately gave chase. During the chase, the officers saw him discard a dark object into the grass beside the railway tracks. They chased him all the way to the bridge near Xiaobang when the person, seeing that there was no way to escape, tried to jump across. The officers caught up and apprehended him. They searched him and found a used bullet casing and two pawn tickets. He was immediately taken to the district office for detention. The patrol officers, along with railway police, searched the nearby grass and found a six-inch pistol (No. 101026) containing seven bullets, one of which was loaded. They also found a small cloth bag containing twelve bullets. However, as the officers were examining the pistol, they were unaware that a bullet was loaded. They accidentally touched the trigger, and the pistol fired, hitting railway police officer Gu Guangde in the left toe. He was rushed to the Railway Hospital for treatment. The pistol and other items were sent to the Fifth District Office for safekeeping. District Chief Jin commissioned District Officer Xia Xuan Yu to interrogate him overnight. According to his testimony, his name was Wang Xiaosizi, 20 years old, from Funing. He lived in a thatched house near the Suzhou Station and was married to Zeng. Recently, he secretly had an affair with Geng Ba Sizi, a locomotive fireman at the North Station, and plotted to harm me. He fled to Shanghai to avoid this. District Officer Xia believed that the suspect's testimony was all excuses. Since it was late, he ordered him to be detained and re-interrogated yesterday. After rigorous questioning, he confessed that he went to the North Station on the instructions of a person named Zhou Wen. He had known Zhou for many years and had lived with him on a boat in Zhenjiang. They had committed a robbery in Maoshan, Zhenjiang, and he had received twenty yuan as his share. Later, Zhou feared being caught and moved to Shanghai, living in a thatched house behind Zhongxing Road. He went to Shanghai to find Zhou, and since both were very poor, they agreed to rob a wealthy local family near the Zhijiang Temple in Zhabei at 10:00 PM on the 24th. They planned to first break through the bamboo fence and then open the main gate. If successful, they would then rob Pushan Villa. After reviewing the testimony, District Officer Xia immediately asked about the whereabouts of Zhou Wen and led patrol officers to arrest him overnight for joint interrogation.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Plans to Expand Public Cemetery</h3>
<p>The public cemetery built by the Municipal Government in Jiangwan was completed last year. At last week's municipal meeting, a proposal to expand the cemetery was submitted. It was resolved to instruct the heads of the Finance, Land, Public Works, and Health Bureaus to prepare a detailed draft plan for the government's approval.</p>
<h3>Three Robbers Resist Arrest, Stray Bullets Injure People</h3>
<p>One Robber Arrested on Pingji Li Road</p>
<p>At 7:15 PM last night, detectives from the French Concession were patrolling the middle section of Pingji Li Road when they saw a young man approaching. He looked flustered and acted suspiciously. They immediately searched him and found a loaded pistol. He was immediately taken to the police station. After being questioned by the chief detective, he was ordered to be detained for questioning by the court.</p>
<p>At 9:20 PM that night, several patrol detectives from the French Concession were patrolling the intersection of Kai Zi Er Road and Weier Meng Road when they saw three suspicious-looking individuals. The detectives ordered them to stop, but the three men turned and fled north, firing at the detectives as they ran. The three robbers fled into the Public Concession. The detectives returned to the police station to report the incident. At 9:30 PM, a Chinese police officer No. 315 from the Xin Zha police station sent a pedestrian named Zhang Axiao (46 years old, from Suzhou) who had been injured by a stray bullet to Renji Hospital for treatment. He was found to have been shot through the left leg. According to Zhang Axiao, he had just arrived in Shanghai from Suzhou and was planning to visit a friend who worked as a street vendor at the intersection of La Da Gu Road and La Ma De Li Road when he was caught in the crossfire between the detectives and the robbers. Considering the timing and location, the incident was completely consistent with the detectives in the French Concession pursuing the three men. It is likely that the three robbers encountered detectives again after entering the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>Fang Xiajun Donates Money to Save the Country</h3>
<p>Mr. Fang Xiajun of this city, concerned about the perilous state of Peiping and Tianjin, donated 790 yuan to support the Northeastern Volunteer Army. He refused to give his name and address.

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>###烈性楊花</p>
<h3>Fierce Willow Catkins</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>春去也！山邊水涯有許多白衣冠的送客，彷彿在唱變微之歌：韶光畢兮酷日來，長春一去兮何日回？</p>
<p>Spring departs! There are many white-clad people seeing it off by the mountains and waterside, seemingly singing a song of decline: The beautiful time is over, and the scorching sun comes; Changchun is gone, when will it return?</p>
<p>白衣冠的送客是誰？便是紛紛飛舞的烈性楊花。楊花有水性的稱呼，這是侮辱它。楊花的性子却和烈士一般的烈。它是炎炎的赤日，逐走了可愛的陽春，便抱定着寗爲玉碎莫作瓦全的宗旨；它不再在樹枝上偷安了，紛紛的成羣結隊，要在山邊水涯去尋回那已逝的春光。唉！楊花太愚了已逝的春光怎麽可以尋取回來呢？但，楊花一切不顧的犠牲到底，毅然决然的要在酷日當令的底下尋回春光，拚着沾在泥裹落在水裹而終於骨化形消！楊花的烈性，楊花的偉大，確有令人欽佩的價値。</p>
<p>Who are the white-clad people seeing it off? They are the fiercely dancing willow catkins. Willow catkins are called "watery," which is an insult to them. The temperament of willow catkins is as fierce as that of a martyr. The scorching sun has driven away the lovely spring, so they hold fast to the principle of preferring to be shattered jade rather than complete tile; they no longer seek ease on the branches, but in droves, they go to the mountains and waterside to seek the lost spring. Alas! The willow catkins are too foolish, how can the lost spring be found again? But, the willow catkins sacrifice everything to the end, resolutely seeking to reclaim the spring under the rule of the scorching sun, risking getting stuck in the mud and falling into the water, and ultimately turning to bone and disappearing! The fierce nature of willow catkins, the greatness of willow catkins, does have a value that is admirable.</p>
<p>春去以後，依着大自然的順序，自有重來的日子；但是，關外的長春，已做了孤狸的窟穴，還有重來的日子麽？要在酷日的勢力範圍裹面，奪回長春，不知在何年何月才能够完成這偉大工作？</p>
<p>After spring departs, according to the order of nature, there will be days of return; but Changchun outside the customs has become a den of foxes, will there still be days of return? To recapture Changchun within the sphere of influence of the scorching sun, I wonder in what year and month can this great work be completed?</p>
<p>山邊水涯尋覓已逝春光的烈性楊花，分明是自然界中的義勇軍，沾泥的已沾泥了，落水的已落水了：但是，飄零在空中的楊花，依舊秉着大無畏的精神，而希望着逐去酷日，尋回春光。</p>
<p>The fierce willow catkins searching for the lost spring by the mountains and waterside are clearly the volunteer army in the natural world. Those stuck in the mud are already stuck, and those fallen into the water have already fallen; but the willow catkins drifting in the air still uphold the spirit of fearlessness and hope to drive away the scorching sun and reclaim the spring.</p>
<p>楊花放心吧，依着大自然的順序，春光總會重來的啊。</p>
<p>Willow catkins, rest assured, according to the order of nature, spring will always return.</p>
<h3>捧啟</h3>
<h3>Opening with Praise</h3>
<p>— 沃</p>
<p>— Wo</p>
<p>捧是成功的必需條件；在臺上的需要捧，没上臺的更需要捧。這年頭因受捧而成名的人，眞如恒河之沙。没有人捧的根本上别想出名。你看那個舞臺上的ＸＸ泰斗，那個名人，那個皇后，那個交際花不是給人家捧出來的（捧），其中實含有生物學上的（共生作用。譬如說在臺上的要人有人捧則位置牢，臺下的要人有人捧則高調可以唱得格外響。而同時捧的人有的是盡了（食錄報恩）之責，有的則正候着隨自家主人走馬上任，二者間正有一種互相倚賴的作用在。</p>
<p>Praise is a necessary condition for success; those on stage need praise, and those not on stage need it even more. In this day and age, people who become famous because of praise are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. Without someone praising you, don't even think about becoming famous. Look at that XX guru on the stage, that celebrity, that queen, that socialite, aren't they all praised into existence? In fact, it contains a biological (symbiotic relationship). For example, if an important person on stage is praised, their position is secure, and if an important person off stage is praised, their high-profile can be sung extra loud. At the same time, some of those who praise are fulfilling the responsibility of (repaying kindness), while others are waiting to follow their master into office. There is a mutual dependence between the two.</p>
<p>因爲（捧）之重要，所以古時候，孟嘗君有食客三千。現今要人的（走狗）更是多得不可勝數。</p>
<p>Because of the importance of (praise), in ancient times, Lord Mengchang had three thousand retainers. Nowadays, important people's (lackeys) are even more numerous.</p>
<p>漪歟！（捧）之道，千古長存！</p>
<p>Ah! The way of (praise) lasts forever!</p>

<p>— 沙菲</p>
<p>— Shafi</p>
<p>在嘴上高唱着獨身主義的人，實際上便是醉心戀愛者，這並不是掩飾，却是等待着時機。</p>
<p>People who loudly advocate celibacy are actually deeply in love; this is not a cover-up, but waiting for an opportunity.</p>
<p>○○○卑劣的人不能産生偉大的戀愛，輕浮的人，只知道一點戀愛的娛樂。○○○痛苦有二個極端，愈痛苦而愈快活，惟有情海中的人，才眞實地體騐到了全部。</p>
<p>○○○ Base people cannot produce great love; frivolous people only know a little of the entertainment of love. ○○○ There are two extremes of pain; the more painful, the more joyful. Only those in the sea of love truly experience it all.</p>
<p>○○○假使女子使男子愛慕只是美麗和天眞，那末女子在這二點消失後，情愛也自然而然會烟消雲散。</p>
<p>○○○ If a woman makes a man admire her only for her beauty and innocence, then after these two disappear, love will naturally vanish.</p>
<h3>烏篷船</h3>
<h3>Black-awning Boat</h3>
<p>— 趙子明</p>
<p>— Zhao Ziming</p>
<p>我的故鄉紹興，的確是個山明水秀的所在，當桃紅柳綠，春光明媚中；登蘭亭，游東湖，其樂融融，環城内外，河流聚多，往來交通，非船不能成行。</p>
<p>My hometown, Shaoxing, is indeed a place of picturesque scenery. When the peach blossoms are red and the willows are green, and the spring is bright; climbing the Orchid Pavilion and touring the East Lake are delightful. Inside and outside the city, there are many rivers, and transportation can only be done by boat.</p>
<p>烏篷船是故鄉的特産，船篷烏黑，以此得名，篷身是用竹蔑編成，篷上開有窓洞，嵌以透明魚鱗，船頭畫有虎面，，（三明瓦）（四明瓦）之稱。明瓦之多少，代表船艙的大小；大的可客十數人，是用櫓搖，小的能坐三四人，是用脚划，一名（脚划船）船夫划槳，以脚代手，開行迅速，神妙異常，汪洋無邊，一葉扁舟，誰說中個人不勇敢？</p>
<p>The black-awning boat is a specialty of my hometown. It is named for its black awning, which is woven from bamboo strips. There are window holes in the awning, inlaid with transparent fish scales. The bow is painted with a tiger face, and it is called (three-transparent tile) (four-transparent tile). The number of transparent tiles represents the size of the cabin; the large ones can accommodate a dozen people and are rowed with oars, while the small ones can seat three or four people and are paddled with feet, called (foot-paddling boat). The boatman paddles with his feet instead of his hands, and it moves quickly and magically. In the boundless ocean, a small boat, who says the Chinese are not brave?</p>
<p>鄉間婦女，三五成羣，；進城購物，伊們都是天足，能用脚划船，雖没有摩登氣，但却含天然美！</p>
<p>Rural women, in groups of three or five, go to the city to shop. They all have unbound feet and can paddle boats with their feet. Although they lack a modern air, they contain natural beauty!</p>
<p>近來城裹馬路建築。汽車行駛，但是烏篷船能適應環境的需要，價廉行便，雖是十七世紀的創造物。直到現在還不受時代的淘汰，實有留存的價値。汽車是爲守財奴，官老爺，擴張威勢的工具。大家都厭惡，雅號（鐵牛），倘如長此以往，不久必受排擠。而烏篷船自有它的長處，將永遠的保存下去。</p>
<p>Recently, roads have been built in the city and cars are running, but the black-awning boat can adapt to the needs of the environment, is cheap and convenient, and although it is a creation of the 17th century, it has not been eliminated by the times and has value for preservation. Cars are tools for misers and officials to expand their power. Everyone hates them and they are nicknamed (iron ox). If this continues, they will soon be squeezed out. But the black-awning boat has its own advantages and will be preserved forever.</p>
<h3>哭孫經笙師</h3>
<h3>Lamenting Teacher Sun Jingsheng</h3>
<p>— 費文寳</p>
<p>— Fei Wenbao</p>
<p>吳江孫經笙先生延庚，主講民立中學埀念五年，循循善誘，誨人不倦，治事勤愼，數十年如一日。及門弟子，受其教益，成名而去者，先後有實業家李祖賢祖範昆仲，交際家蔣君毅，小說家周瘦鵑陸澹　。法律家蔣保釐等。而濫竽門下，以不舞之鶴，貽先生羞者，祇僕一人而已。</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Jingsheng of Wujiang, who passed away recently, lectured at Minli Middle School for 55 years, guiding students patiently, teaching tirelessly, and handling affairs diligently, day after day for decades. Disciples who benefited from his teaching and became famous include industrialists Li Zuxian and his brother Zufan, socialite Jiang Junyi, novelists Zhou Shoujuan and Lu Dan'an, and jurist Jiang Baoli. And I, the only one among his students who was a useless member, like a crane that does not dance, brought shame to the teacher.</p>
<p>先生天性和易，美鬚髯，善飲酒，而自奉極儉。其長公子錫藩，任職美亞保險公司，處事勤奮，極得社會信仰，不幸數年前，先先生而逝，痛抱北郭，益傷老人情懹。在先生雖勉爲逹觀，而知先生者，莫不以晚年傷此克家之子、爲先生惜焉。</p>
<p>The teacher was naturally kind and gentle, with a beautiful beard, good at drinking, but extremely frugal in his own lifestyle. His eldest son, Xifan, worked for American Asiatic Underwriters and was diligent in his work, earning the trust of society. Unfortunately, he passed away several years ago before the teacher, causing great sorrow and further hurting the old man's feelings. Although the teacher tried to be philosophical, those who knew him all felt sorry for him, mourning the loss of such a capable son in his old age.</p>
<p>蘇頴傑師，長民立中學，嘗以仇蓉秋孫經笙先生，爲左右手。今先生旣逝，在蘇師缺一得力之助理，母校同學，失一良好之導師，而教育界又隕一明星矣。哀哉！</p>
<p>Teacher Su Yingjie, the principal of Minli Middle School, often regarded Qiu Rongqiu and Mr. Sun Jingsheng as his right and left hands. Now that the teacher has passed away, Teacher Su has lost a capable assistant, the students of the alma mater have lost a good mentor, and the education field has lost another star. Alas!</p>
<p>今母校諸師，特於月之二十三日，爲先生開會追悼於西門之關帝廟，是日知交故舊，及門桃李，不憚道遠，蒞會弔奠者逾數百人云。</p>
<p>Today, the teachers of the alma mater will hold a memorial service for the teacher at the Guandi Temple in the West Gate on the 23rd of the month. On that day, close friends, old acquaintances, and students, not afraid of the long journey, will attend the service, with more than several hundred people paying their respects.</p>

<p>江氏笑道：不！我作事就是這様，要一個人動手，一手作成功的事，自已也順心些。說着，抬着桌子，搬着椅子，忙個不了。趙翁手摸了鬍芔，不住的點頭。桂枝道：老太爺您瞧我媽的脾氣擰嗎？有事情情願一個人去作。趙翁笑道：不算擰，我也是這個様子的，這不光是爲了順心，作慣了事的人，瞧見人家作事，自已不作事，心裹怪難受的。江氏一拍手道：對了！老太爺，我就是這様想着。趙翁笑着摸了鬍子道：老太，您呌你大姑娘學自强，那用不着，讓她跟着您多學一點兒就是了。說着話時，伊娘兒倆將東西已經料理清楚，趙翁呌道：小林，把酒壺拿來，咱們先喝兩杯。小林聽說，提了壺進來，趙翁接着，斟了一杯，就遞到桌子正面放下，笑道：楊老太，你忙了半天上坐着，多喝一鐘。江氏蹲着請了個安道：這可不敢當您這大年紀，倒要您敬酒？我跟您回敬一杯吧？桂　枝心裹一機靈，就笑道：總算我年紀小些，我來斟酒得了。趙翁點點頭道：你這話說得有理，我就不客氣了。於是讓江氏上坐，趙翁和桂枝兩橫頭，江氏呌林坐在下方，他死也不肯。趙翁道：他不肯坐，就隨他罷。你勉强逼着他坐下來，他也吃得不順心的。不如我們吃完了。讓他一個人坐到櫉房裹去，愛吃多少，就吃多少。小林低了頭，只是呆站在一邊不作聲。桂枝斟完了酒，也坐下來斯斯文文的吃着。趙翁夾了幾塊羊肉在開水鍋子裹刷了幾刷，然後叉着羊肉向桂枝面前的小碗裹塞了下去，笑道：只管說小林坐着不能順心吃，你可别那様呀！老太，喝！難得的，咱們居然在一處過年，吃一個痛快。於是端起大杯子，向江氏舉了一舉。江氏喝了一口酒道：眞的，人事眞說不定，誰會想到今年過年叨擾老太爺這一餐呢？話可又說回來了，今年咱們在一處過年明年又知道那個在那裹呢？（五二）</p>
<p>Ms. Jiang smiled: "No! That's how I do things, I want one person to do it, to do things successfully with one hand, and I'll feel more comfortable myself." As she spoke, she carried the table, moved the chairs, and was busy without end. Old Zhao stroked his beard and nodded continuously. Guizhi said: "Old man, do you think my mother is stubborn? She would rather do things alone." Old Zhao laughed: "It's not stubborn, I'm also like this. It's not just for comfort, people who are used to doing things feel uncomfortable when they see others doing things and they don't do anything themselves." Ms. Jiang clapped her hands and said: "That's right! Old man, that's what I was thinking." Old Zhao smiled and stroked his beard and said: "Old lady, you tell your eldest daughter to learn to be self-reliant, there's no need for that, just let her learn more from you." As he spoke, the mother and daughter had already arranged things clearly, and Old Zhao shouted: "Xiao Lin, bring the wine pot, let's have a couple of drinks first." Xiao Lin heard this, brought the pot in, and Old Zhao took it, poured a cup, and put it down on the front of the table, smiling: "Old lady Yang, you've been busy for half a day, sit down and have a drink." Ms. Jiang squatted down and gave a bow, saying: "I can't accept that, you're so old, you're going to offer me wine? Let me return a cup to you, right?" Guizhi's mind raced, and she laughed: "I'm younger after all, let me pour the wine." Old Zhao nodded and said: "You're right, then I won't be polite." So he let Ms. Jiang sit in the upper seat, with Old Zhao and Guizhi on either side. Ms. Jiang asked Lin to sit below, but he refused to die. Old Zhao said: "If he doesn't want to sit, let him be. If you force him to sit down, he won't eat comfortably. It's better for us to finish eating. Let him sit alone in the kitchen, and he can eat as much as he wants." Xiao Lin lowered his head and just stood silently on the side. Guizhi poured the wine, sat down, and ate politely. Old Zhao picked up a few pieces of mutton, brushed them a few times in the boiling water pot, and then stuck the mutton into the small bowl in front of Guizhi, laughing: "You keep saying that Xiao Lin can't eat comfortably sitting down, don't be like that! Old lady, drink! It's rare that we can spend the New Year together, let's eat heartily." So he raised his large cup and toasted to Ms. Jiang. Ms. Jiang took a sip of wine and said: "Really, things are really uncertain, who would have thought that we would bother the old man for this meal during the New Year? But then again, we're spending the New Year together this year, who knows where we'll be next year?" (52)</p>

<h3>婚禮</h3>
<h3>Wedding</h3>
<p>— 傅敬嘉</p>
<p>— Fu Jingjia</p>
<p>春假給了我一個參與婚禮的機會。我的職務是當一個男儐相。軍樂聲中，我和另一位男儐相挽着那穿著燕尾服的新郎的手臂緩緩地向禮堂走。没一個人不帶着歡樂的笑容。然而我是没分的。那軍樂聲，那紅紅綠綠的彩球，那掛着的對聯綢幛，那四周的人們，没一様使我感到興味。我要哭。我没法子趕走我心中的悲哀。</p>
<p>Spring break gave me the opportunity to participate in a wedding. My job was to be a groomsman. To the sound of military music, I and another groomsman linked arms with the tailcoat-clad groom and slowly walked towards the auditorium. Not a single person wasn't wearing a happy smile. However, I had no part in it. That military music, those red and green colored balls, those hanging couplets and silk banners, those people all around, not one thing made me feel interested. I wanted to cry. I couldn't chase away the sadness in my heart.</p>
<p>我想起了我自已的不幸的運命，我想起了我自已漂泊的渺茫前途，我想起了自已的生人！我傷心，我難過，我想哭。那不是快樂的幸運的禮堂，那簡直是一座嚴蕭的悲傷的地獄啊！</p>
<p>I thought of my own unfortunate fate, I thought of my own wandering, bleak future, I thought of my own life! I was sad, I was upset, I wanted to cry. That wasn't a happy, fortunate auditorium, it was simply a solemn, sad hell!</p>
<p>可是我没敢哭出來，在這種所謂（喜事）裹面是不容許這種惹人厭憎的哭聲的。我只得將眼涙呑進肚。我終於將要爆發的情感壓止了。</p>
<p>But I didn't dare to cry out. In this so-called (happy occasion), such annoying cries are not allowed. I had to swallow my tears. I finally suppressed the emotions that were about to explode.</p>
<p>我切實的了解不幸的人只有不幸的，不幸的人要想在幸運的人前得到一些幸運的餘惠都不可能的。</p>
<p>I truly understand that the unfortunate are only unfortunate, and it is impossible for the unfortunate to get some of the remaining benefits of good fortune in front of the fortunate.</p>
<p>我發誓我不再參加這種幸運的事件。人家的幸運正是我的悲傷啊！</p>
<p>I swear I will never participate in such fortunate events again. Other people's good fortune is my sadness!</p>
<p>可是，不幸的人就不幸到底嗎？我不信，十萬個不信！</p>
<p>But, are the unfortunate unfortunate to the end? I don't believe it, not in a hundred thousand ways!</p>

<h3>杭州偶拾</h3>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— 張亦菴</p>
<p>— Zhang Yi'an</p>
<p>春天，不止是氣候的温度柔和起來，連田野的光綫色彩也絶不强烈，旣不甚明，也不甚晦，晴朗之中帶着糢糊，遠景的顔色像珍珠那様銀灰而有光彩，一切的色調都是淡淡薄薄的；桃花的微紅，菜花的金黃，算是最觸目的了。</p>
<p>In spring, it is not only the temperature of the climate that softens, but even the colors of the light in the fields are not strong at all, neither very bright nor very dim. The sunshine is hazy, and the color of the distant view is silvery-gray and luminous like pearls. All the hues are light and thin; the faint red of the peach blossoms and the golden yellow of the rapeseed flowers are the most eye-catching.</p>
<p>在杭州城裹有許多高大的粉牆，在上海是不很看得見的，可是近年這些牆壁上不是塗滿藍白色的標語便是花綠綠的商業廣告，於是我知道杭州不但革命化，而且商業化了。</p>
<p>There are many tall whitewashed walls in Hangzhou, which are not very visible in Shanghai, but in recent years these walls are either covered with blue and white slogans or brightly colored commercial advertisements, so I know that Hangzhou is not only revolutionary but also commercialized.</p>
<p>在市招等東西上廣告圖案式的字逐漸加多，專家的書法逐漸减少，這些廣告圖案式的字也圖案得不高明，於是在游人的眼裹也逐漸覺得可厭了。</p>
<p>The number of advertising patterns on shop signs and other things is gradually increasing, while the calligraphy of experts is gradually decreasing. These advertising patterns are not very clever, so they are gradually becoming annoying in the eyes of tourists.</p>
<p>名勝地的題壁，似乎比以前减少了。以塗抺牆壁的肉麻詩及（某年某月某日某某人來游）與肉麻標語相比較，則題壁似乎比較不肉麻一點，因爲題壁的東西，雖然肉麻，也許有些兒眞情的流露，不過修詞上或欠功夫罷了；（來游於此）等也許有多少歷史價値，而不肉麻的東西也會偶然發現。這些東西，縱不使你欣賞，有時也會令你發笑。至於肉麻的標語，則只是表現出說大話的民族性。至於汚損名勝牆壁，則題壁與標語，其揆一也。</p>
<p>It seems that there are fewer inscriptions on the walls of scenic spots than before. Compared with the nauseating poems and (so-and-so came to visit on such-and-such a day) and the nauseating slogans painted on the walls, the inscriptions seem to be a little less nauseating, because although the inscriptions are nauseating, they may contain some genuine feelings, but they may lack skill in rhetoric; (came to visit here) etc. may have some historical value, and things that are not nauseating will also be discovered occasionally. These things, even if they don't make you appreciate them, may sometimes make you laugh. As for nauseating slogans, they only express the national character of boasting. As for defacing the walls of scenic spots, the principle of inscriptions and slogans is the same.</p>
<p>名勝的地方，似乎少不了呌化子作點綴，尤其是在香節等時期，杭州當然不能例外。</p>
<p>It seems that scenic spots cannot do without beggars as decorations, especially during incense festivals and other times. Of course, Hangzhou is no exception.</p>
<p>靈隱天竺之間，雲棲的路上，你可以看見許多呌化子的步哨，一路上就是一個殘廢的展覽會，而且他們特别將殘廢的部份可怕地顯露出來以博得游客的哀憐而施與。我不明白一個杭州，何來這許多千奇百怪的殘廢人物。後來聽說有一部份是故意弄成殘廢以</p>

<h3>National Universities and Cultural Institutions in Beiping Actively Transport Valuable Books and Instruments</h3>
<p>The Beiping Research Institute has already transported a portion.</p>
<p>Peking University and Normal University are separately sorting and numbering [items].</p>
<p>Jiaotong University's Tangshan College has completely transported [items] to Shanghai.</p>
<p>However, the Beiping Library has not yet prepared for relocation.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The Ministry of Education instructed universities and cultural institutions in Peiping and Tianjin to relocate valuable books and instruments. Peking University was the first to pack boxes. Other universities and cultural institutions also made considerable preparations. The situations in various institutions are described as follows:</p>
<h3>Xu Songming Clarifies</h3>
<p>The rumor that national universities in Peiping and Tianjin received an order from the Ministry of Education two weeks ago to relocate books and instruments is clarified. Yesterday, the reporter visited Xu Songming, the acting president of Peking University, and inquired about the truth. He replied that the rumor that the National Peking University and cultural institutions received an order to move valuable books and instruments two weeks ago was a misunderstanding. The order only arrived in Peiping yesterday. Because it is a confidential order, the original text cannot be published. The Central Political Council approved Mr. Wang Shijie's succession as Minister of Education. He originally intended to go to the capital to request instructions on school affairs, but he is temporarily postponing his trip due to the current situation.</p>
<p>Peking University held a temporary school affairs meeting today, attended by Xu Songming, Gu Cheng, Deng Bocui, Wu Xiangfeng, Liu Yunchou, Sun Guofeng, Zuo Zongyang, and Yan Zhikai, to discuss measures for relocating books and instruments: (1) It was decided to send letters to the colleges, ordering them to prepare to pack valuable books and instruments according to the Ministry of Education's order. (2) A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Education, requesting allocation of relocation expenses for books and instruments.</p>
<h3>Beiping Research Institute</h3>
<p>The National Beiping Research Institute also received an order from the Ministry of Education to prepare to relocate valuable books and instruments to a safe area. At 8 AM today (21st), the institute completed packing valuable items, which were transported by vehicles out of the Beiping Research General Office in Zhonghai. Only a few boxes were transported, and the destination is unknown, but it is a safe area and will not be announced for the time being. According to Li Shuhua, the vice president of the institute, the Beiping Research Institute does not have many books, but the Institute of Physics and Chemistry and the Institute of Physiology have no less than one hundred thousand instruments and specimens. Transportation is quite difficult. Currently, a portion of important files, books, and instruments are being transported first.</p>
<h3>Peking University</h3>
<p>Most of Peking University's ancient books have already been packed. Handwritten manuscripts and rare books are carefully packaged. The instruments of the College of Science are also being sorted, numbered, and prepared for transport south. The five departments of Chemistry, Physics, Geology, Physiology, and Psychology have many instruments, the most valuable of which are priceless treasures. According to Jiang Menglin, the president of Peking University, the relocation of books and instruments is in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Education. Our school has a history of more than thirty years. The quantity of books and instruments is greater than any other university in the country. The valuable items are truly invaluable. Therefore, given the tense situation, in order to preserve our country's inherent culture, we have no choice but to relocate books and instruments.</p>
<h3>Normal University</h3>
<p>After receiving the telegram from the Ministry of Education, Normal University also began actively preparing to relocate books and instruments. It is said that for the books, the first batch will pack 200 boxes first, and they are currently being sorted and registered, with a deadline of three days to complete packing. In addition to the Physics Department, which has already packed more than twenty boxes, the Chemistry and Physiology Departments will also start as soon as wooden boxes are made. The school held a special school affairs meeting and discussion today to exchange opinions on the preservation of instruments and books, and unanimously resolved two measures: (1) The items to be packed should not hinder student use. (2) The items to be packed are extremely valuable and not easily obtainable elsewhere. After the meeting, the General Affairs Department immediately ordered wooden boxes from the lumber factory separately for various departments to use. The Chemistry Department needs about dozens of wooden boxes. After these wooden boxes are made, packing work will begin. All items to be packed will be handled in accordance with the two principles resolved at the discussion meeting.</p>
<h3>Beiping Library</h3>
<p>Yuan Tongli, the vice president of the National Beiping Library, told reporters that although the situation is quite critical, it has no impact on our library. All books have not been prepared for packing and shipping. In his opinion, although the Japanese have propaganda about occupying Peiping and Tianjin, it is still questionable whether they will definitely occupy them. Our library is a cultural institution. Whether the Japanese come is a political issue and has nothing to do with culture. There should be no loss to our library. Moreover, there are too many books in the library, even if we pack and transport them, it will take a lot of time. Furthermore, a large number of literati rely on our library as a basis for their livelihood every day, either gathering materials for writing, or referring to materials for writing, and then submitting them to various publications, using the proceeds as living expenses. If they are packed and shipped away, they will inevitably panic greatly. Therefore, there is no packing plan for all the books in our library so far. However, books are one of the social undertakings, and I am only responsible for management. Whether it is necessary to pack and transport them is not within my authority. Director Yuan then led reporters to visit various rooms and saw the Siku Quanshu, rare Song editions, Jin, Yuan, and Ming editions, Tang dynasty scripture copies, and rubbings of bronze and stone inscriptions, all displayed as before. Yuan also said that the library has about 14,000 Chinese books, 143,900 volumes, 76 Manchu and Mongolian books, 672 Western books, 178 Eastern books, and 480 kinds of magazines, estimated to be worth more than 3 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University's Two Colleges</h3>
<p>Due to the tense situation recently, the Peiping Railway Management College of Jiaotong University decided to pack various books and instruments and transport them to Hangzhou, Zhejiang. As soon as vehicles are ready, they can be shipped. According to Xu Chengyu, the president of the college, our college has a long history and many books. Several boxes of English books on transportation management cannot be purchased now. In addition, there are French, German, and Japanese books. In terms of instruments, because there was a Telecommunications Department before, there are also many valuable instruments. Relocation is not easy. Furthermore, the Tangshan Civil Engineering College of Jiaotong University completely relocated books and instruments to Shanghai on the 18th. Because Tangshan is the closest to the front line, the college relocated books and instruments the earliest (21st).</p>
<p>For the past month, the chemistry PhD has traveled back and forth between Washington, New York, and Philadelphia, Baltimore, and other places, visiting various universities, chemical plants, and other academic institutions. Now that the investigation is completed, he boarded the German ship Europe on March 23, heading to London from New York. It is heard that he will enter Cambridge University to study for another semester, and then go to Germany for several weeks of investigation before returning home.</p>

<h3>Ministry Order Promotes Sports and Notes Two Points</h3>
<p>(1) Strive to provide opportunities for participation to all men and women, young and old, in all industries</p>
<p>(2) Schools should strive for universal development in each student</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 24th) The Ministry of Education issued an order stating that physical education is related to the strength of the nation. The first National Physical Education Conference was convened last August, and preparations are being made for the National Games this year to demonstrate promotion. However, in recent years, in addition to the physical education courses and facilities already available in schools, the number of public sports fields is very small, so that people in all industries have no opportunity to exercise. Adults and women in particular have little interest in physical education. In the future, we must strive to provide opportunities for men and women, young and old, in all industries to participate in physical education. 1. Recently, physical education in schools has focused on individual sports, and sports meets in various places also focus on competition as the goal. Some students who are proficient in sports skills may not need to study other courses in peacetime. In order to win championships, they are often given special favors. Regardless of whether there are several violent sports that are enough to damage the body, even if they are allowed to overstep school rules, it is inappropriate. In the future, physical education in schools must be for the universal development of each student. Schools should also be promoters of local sports, awakening society so that people can implement physical education, so that they will not deviate from the central government's promotion of the purpose of physical education. 2. Instruct each of the colleges, academies, halls, and bureaus to inform their subordinates for uniform knowledge.</p>

<h3>Amateur Group A Marksmanship Championship: Li Gongying Enters Finals</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Victory Over Zhang Yingda: 1000 Points to 873</p>
<p>Finals Tomorrow Against Medina</p>
<p>...Total Competition of 2000 Points, Held Over Three Days...</p>
<p>In yesterday's Amateur Marksmanship Championship semi-finals in Shanghai, Li Gongying defeated Zhang Yingda and will compete with the previous champion, Medina, for this year's title. Li's victory yesterday was expected, but unexpectedly, Zhang Yingda gave an outstanding performance. His composure and thorough planning were almost on par with Li Gongxian. The final score was 1000 points to 873, with Li winning by 127 points. At the beginning of the first round, Li had six blanks in a row, suddenly giving Zhang a good opportunity to advance. Unfortunately, he did not handle it properly and did not gain much. Before long, Li caught up. It is recalled that when both sides were at over 170 points, Zhang became very active and surpassed Li several times. Later, they continued to compete back and forth. When they each had 362 match points, Li used his skills to his advantage, scoring 48, 64, and 49 points, resulting in a score of 500 to 423. At the beginning of the second round, Li again displayed his excellent technique, scoring consecutive high numbers of 81, 29, and 58, widening the gap to 200 points (752 to 552). However, Li stopped at this point, while Zhang's momentum peaked. He scored large numbers of 37, 31, and 65, narrowing the difference to only about 70 points. The tide turned, and Li's final effort secured him the right to the finals with 1000 points to 873. The final between Li Gongying and Medina will be held over three days. The first day (Wednesday) will be 1000 points, at 5:30 pm and 9:15 pm. The second day (Thursday) will be 500 points at 5:30 pm. The third day (Friday) will be 500 points at 5:30 pm. The total score for the three days is 2000 points. The first to reach the full score wins.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Highest Scores for the Two Players</h3>

<h3>Fashionable Disease</h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>The so-called "Fashionable Disease" is a common epidemic in a contradictory and chaotic society. The word "fashionable" here is not used in the usual sense of "trendy," but rather in the sense of "insisting on making shocking statements." There are several types of "Fashionable Disease," but here we will only discuss the most common one. The symptom of this type is to overthrow everything. Nothing is acceptable, but no one is worthy of carrying out the work of "overthrowing everything." To criticize everything. To feel that others are not thorough enough, are wrong; but he himself jumps in the clouds, never taking a step on solid ground, so he is always thorough, always right.</p>
<p>He disdains doing ordinary things: seeing others doing the hard work of blazing trails, he sneers; he says, "Just jump over it, who has the patience to do it in such a detailed way?" But he himself never jumps for others to see.</p>
<p>He lives a petty bourgeois life, but constantly curses others as petty bourgeois; he is surrounded by feudal thoughts and feudal forces, but he thinks that feudal thoughts have long been in decline, and feudal forces only have a half-breath left, so if anyone is still attacking feudal thoughts, in his eyes, they are behind the times. He is a lone hero, he denies objective reality!</p>
<p>He never says "I," but in his heart there is always a big "I"! He shouts every day: give me light, give me freedom! But he is afraid of the semi-darkness on the road from darkness to light, and he uses beautiful words to cover up his fear. He wants freedom, but he refuses to climb the ladder to freedom, because he is against the ordinary step-by-step climb, his ideal is to "fly"!</p>
<p>His joy is: always having material to curse, so he is the most courageous and thorough "revolutionary." But his sorrow is: the "revolution" does not understand him!</p>
<h3>Immobile Posture</h3>
<p>— Li Shu</p>
<p>These days in the countryside, conscription and militia training are in full swing. Orders have been given to stop spring plowing, and everyone goes to the parade ground to study "Attention" and "At Ease," researching "Immobile Posture."</p>
<p>It is said that the county magistrate will also personally go to the countryside to inspect whose "Immobile Posture" is done best; the good will naturally be rewarded, and the bad will naturally be punished. As for those who cherish the spring light and go to cultivate the fields without authorization, that's unacceptable. Poor people will be spanked, and those with some money will be fined thirty-six yuan. That goes without saying. The county magistrate is a good county magistrate, he says what he means and does what he says. A few days ago, an inspector came out to inspect once, and those who were caught were caught, and those who were dragged were dragged, and a large group of people were taken away. If the county magistrate personally takes action, needless to say, there will be more to see.</p>
<p>The villagers are still "ignorant people," too stupid to be taught, worrying about not plowing in the spring, how to weed in the summer, what to harvest in the fall, and what to store in the winter. They don't know that "Immobile Posture" has its own wonderful uses. Our country is originally a country of "Immobile Posture." When the Japanese warlords attacked Liaoning, we were "calm." When the Japanese warlords occupied Jilin and Heilongjiang, we were "calm." When the Japanese warlords seized Jinzhou and Shanhaiguan, we were still "calm." From "non-resistance" to "long-term resistance," from "waiting for the League of Nations to impose sanctions" to "internal first, then external" and the "Twenty-Year National Salvation Plan," aren't these all aspects of "Immobile Posture"? The country still relies on "Immobile Posture" to save face, so what else can the ignorant people say?</p>
<p>Dancing can save the country, and restoring old morality can defeat the enemy. When broadswords are everywhere, machine guns, tanks, and eighty-year-old cannons all turn into dust. So, if "Immobile Posture" is well-trained, then of course, one "Attention" will result in grain and wheat and everything else. When the Japanese soldiers see this "Immobile Posture," they will definitely be frightened and run away, each of them trembling with fear and dying. Perhaps the three islands of Fusang will be submerged by "Immobile Posture," which is more effective than "sitting tight," isn't it?</p>
<p>Soybeans and oil dumped on the docks can resist the landing of straight-legged foreign devils. Drawing talismans and practicing boxing can resist the Eight-Nation Alliance. The unfathomable strategy of expelling foreign invaders has existed since ancient times. Now, hurriedly practicing "Attention" and focusing on "Immobile Posture" is just a matter of understanding it spiritually, gathering the great achievements of five thousand years.</p>
<h3>Rainy Day</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Since morning, a drizzle has been falling non-stop, lightly falling regardless of everything, which is really annoying. No, a bit depressing. In front of the door, on the asphalt road, a large amount of rainwater is surging, shining brightly and flowing to both sides; on the cinder road at the end of the asphalt road, some low-lying places have even more puddles of various sizes.</p>
<p>In this kind of drizzle, without holding an umbrella and without wearing galoshes, I left home alone and walked onto the cinder road.</p>
<p>As if it were a kind of custom, every time I pass by the door of the dry-cleaning company, I must look at the clock on the door, and then shift my eyes to a small group of boys and girls squatting on the cinder pile beside the road, picking up cinders. Looking at them, none of them seemed to be more than ten years old. Each of their faces was dirty and lifeless, and the clothes they wore were broken and unrecognizable.</p>
<p>Some of them were squatting, some were crawling, scrambling to pick up cinders, like a group of moving ants. Sometimes, they would clash with each other, scold, and then start fighting.</p>
<p>These young children, for the sake of life, cannot go to school to study, but instead spend their time picking up cinders every day, scolding, and fighting, how pitiful!</p>
<p>Today, I thought, I probably wouldn't meet this group of little heroes again, right? Although the time I pass by is the same as usual, today is a rainy day, they may not come out in the rain, right? No, I was wrong. When I walked there, a group of them were still doing the same work on the cinder pile as usual. The torn clothes on several of them were all wet. ("For the sake of life," I thought to myself, "naturally, they can't care about the rain. Aren't I the same as them, running around in the rain for the sake of knowing how to live?")</p>
<p>The rain continued to fall, and my heart couldn't help but become even more gloomy. "(Children, when will you stop picking up cinders every day?)"</p>
<p>In an instant, I felt that I was wrong; what's the use of just being sad? Even if you are sad to death, you can't make the slightest contribution to society. On the contrary, it shows your own weakness...</p>
<p>("In this world, there are too many people suffering.") In the end, I still repeatedly thought this, left a group of little heroes, and continued forward along the cinder road in the drizzle.</p>
<h3>Hometown Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Mu Shiying</p>
<p>Five: Tomb Sweeping</p>
<p>Before dawn, we got up; carrying wine, dishes, and snacks, by the time we walked to the boat, the sun had just come out. What a lovely morning, what a clean blue sky! The sky was so vast, with only one cloud hanging in mid-air, perfectly round. The horizon was a series of distant mountains, like splashed-ink paintings, distant mountains with a desolate and ancient air. Right behind the mountains, the big sun, the blood-red sun, came out. Our boat was sailing towards that side, towards that series of distant mountains, towards that blood-red sun. I lay on the deck at the bow of the boat, letting the scorched yellow sunlight shine on my face. The sound of water gurgled beneath my head; I could hear the sound of the oar sliding on the oar lock at the stern of the boat, like listening to Suzhou women singing love songs on a summer night, that kind of hopelessly mournful sound. In front, I could only see the willow branches floating on the water surface, and the legs of the waterwheel reaching into the water. The things on the riverbank were not visible because the riverbank was higher than my line of sight. Only the ox backs lying on the slanting beach under the riverbank, and the charming faces of the smiling little wildflowers were the different tastes within my field of vision, so quiet! I was sailing in Wang Wei's landscape painting. I couldn't see the boat moving, I just felt the boat sliding from left to right on the water surface. This is a place without time and space; there is no need for speed, no need for stimulation, no need for anesthesia, just a life like mellow Longjing tea, leisurely and unconsciously slipping through history. Slowly, some people got old and sat in the fields, smoking in the sunlight. After a few more years, they died without even realizing it themselves. Then some people slowly grew up, living like their cattle, their fields, their plants, so plant-like. Year after year passed, and they also followed their ancestors and lay in the soil, closing their eyes so happily. Lying down, lying down, the nerve cell tissues that had been compressed in the city softened, and the modern civilization within my education gradually dissolved and disappeared in this quiet, ancient atmosphere. My eyes slowly closed, and then I fell asleep, without a dream, and without any worries of life disturbing my resting nerves. This sleep washed away my fatigue, sorrow, worries, and ambitions of the past twenty-two years. When I woke up, I only felt that I was a newborn baby, with a blank sheet of paper-like heart and a perfect body. I laughed the joy of primitive man! The bones of my whole body were throbbing, the muscles were filled with energy I had never had before, and strong blood was suddenly flowing in my blood vessels. I picked up the rope and jumped to the shore, put the rope around my chest, bent over, rushed forward with my head, and pulled the boat forward step by step on the stone slab road. The melody of the boatman's song welled up in my mouth. For some reason, I had the emotions of a revolutionary, thinking about the French Revolution and the October Revolution, while rushing forward regardless of everything. I only felt that the front was bright, was the Garden of Eden. After pulling for about five miles, I jumped off the boat at Baoguo Temple, because I was fascinated by that ancient temple that dominated the sky. In that desolate pine forest, that yellow, mottled temple was sleeping soundly, a thing that was uncontested and unknown to the world! After Baoguo Temple, the river slowly narrowed, and the sun became higher and more intense. My face was red and burning; the sun dilated the blood vessels under my skin, so dilated that I couldn't even wear a shirt, so I threw open the lapels.</p>
<p>The pebbles at the bottom of the water became clearer and clearer, and there were stone mountains beside the shore, very close, and the mountainsides stretched straight to the water's edge. We had already reached the valley. The water was getting shallower and shallower, and the bottom of the water was full of such rounded pebbles, and from the cracks in the pebbles grew clumps of furry, mysterious aquatic plants. I scooped up a handful of water and washed my face, what cool water! The skin that had been cracked by the sun became as moisturized as if it had been wiped with cold cream. Going a little further, only brown firewood stacks were visible on both banks. At a broken stone bridge, the boat could go no further, so we all jumped ashore. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Carrot Top</h3>
<p>— JULES RENARD, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>This Is a Dog's Dream</p>
<p>Lepic and Ernestine were both buried in their books by the lamp, one reading the newspaper, the other reading the book she had won as a school prize; Mrs. Lepic was doing her sewing, elder brother Felix was warming his feet by the fire, while Carrot Top sat on the floor recalling something. Pirame (the dog's name), sleeping on the straw mat, suddenly let out a soft whine.</p>
<p>"Don't make any noise!" Lepic stopped it.</p>
<p>Pirame whined louder. "Creature!" said Mrs. Lepic.</p>
<p>But Pirame barked more violently, startling everyone. Mrs. Lepic held her hands to her chest. Lepic glared at the dog, gnashing his teeth. Elder brother Felix cursed. All at once, everyone's ears were deafened. "Stop it, you damn dog! Stop it, you good-for-nothing!" Pirame barked even more fiercely. Mrs. Lepic slapped it a few times, Lepic first hit it with the newspaper, then kicked it with his foot. Pirame, afraid of being hit, lay down and whined incessantly, its mouth against the straw mat, barking madly. The entire Lepic family was furious. Everyone stood up, dealing frantically with the dog sleeping on the floor and resisting them. The windowpanes trembled, the chimney on the stove made a shivering sound, and even Sister Ernestine was screaming. But Carrot Top, without anyone telling him to, ran out to see what was going on. Perhaps a vagrant who had been delayed outside was passing by on the street, calmly heading towards his own residence. As long as he didn't climb over the wall to steal anything. Carrot Top walked out of the dark corridor, groping for the door with his arms outstretched. He touched the latch and pulled it open with a loud noise, but he did not open the door.</p>
<p>In the past, he would always risk running outside, whistling, singing, and kicking his feet on the ground, trying to make the enemy afraid. Now he was deceiving people.</p>
<p>While the people at home thought he was bravely searching the hidden places, patrolling around the house like a loyal watchman, he was deceiving them, hiding behind the door without moving.</p>
<p>One day he would be found out, but for a long time his trick had been successful. One day he would be found out, but for a long time his trick had been successful. All he was afraid of was sneezing and coughing. He held his breath, and if he raised his eyes, he could see three or four stars through a small window on the door, the clear brilliance of which made him shiver.</p>
<p>But it was time to go back in. This trick couldn't be played for too long. Otherwise, people would become suspicious. He once again used his fragile hands, shaking the heavy door latch in the rusty iron hook, pushing it all the way to the bottom of the bolt hole with a loud noise. Making such a fuss, people would of course think that he had returned from outside, having done his duty! So he hurried back to comfort his family with a full heart.</p>
<p>However, as before, when Carrot Top walked away, Pirame had already stopped barking, and the Lepic family had quieted down, each returning to their unchanging seats. Although no one asked him anything, Carrot Top still said as usual, "This is a dog's dream."</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Financial Bar Gold Rise How Small</h3>
<p>Also considered a large fall, small rebound of a good one and a half yuan</p>
<p>Various news items inherently feel mutually contradictory</p>
<p>Two market scenes are nothing more than going through twists and turns</p>
<p>The gold market is uncertain and sometimes fluctuates. Foreign telegraphs reported that London spot and forward prices both decreased by 25. New York silver prices increased by 1.25. British-American exchange rates fell by 2.5, while American-British rose by 2.25. Forward silver prices also rose by 3. The bank's private telegraph then rose by 3.5. Although the gross opening price fell, it initially called for ten yuan, but there were few transactions, and the demand was quite strong. Retail investors ate up to 20 yuan. Fuyu, Hengyu, Dadecheng, Fushun, and Fuchang went up to over 30 yuan. Fuyu, Qianchang, and Xiangchang further advanced to 37 or 8 yuan, while Fuchang then came to dewater. The opening price was 932 yuan, mainly because reports stated that British Prime Minister MacDonald had proposed a general international restoration of the gold standard, and people's minds were more stable. The exchange market was tight at the beginning, and the banks were filling up non-stop, so after rising to 40 yuan, it fell quite quickly, because foreign telegraphs reported that British and American experts had determined the gold-silver ratio, and that the economic conference was scheduled to open on June 15, etc. It then fell to 916.5 yuan and then stabilized. Rumors spread that our country banned the export of silver, which led to a rebound, but this news could not be confirmed. The later market opened more stable, generally with an unfavorable environment and a hardening exchange market. The closing price was 926.5 yuan. The initial naked price was calculated to be 42 yuan to 50 yuan higher. The swap discount was therefore more expensive. May-June ranged from 21 yuan to 28.5 yuan, and April-June was 27 yuan. After the market situation was recorded in one day, the morning opening was 932 yuan, which was 7 yuan better than the previous Saturday. Goods opened at one yuan, and the exchange market opened tight for both British and American currencies. The near-term remittance price for British currency was 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 75, and the American currency was 23.5 yuan. Zhifeng Yong first sold, for one yuan, and people's minds were extremely good. Zhaofeng, Changqian, Changxiang, and Shenkang all came to buy fiercely, and then there was a rush to 40 yuan. Mitsui suddenly filled August US dollars at 4.5 yuan. Qingfa, Yongyuan, Maoyong, and Hengxing jointly sold, and Pangen even offered August US dollars at 75 and one yuan. Hengyu, Shunli, and Zhaofengchang then went up to 5 yuan. Huabi continued to fill May US dollars at 3.625 yuan. Hengyu and Dadecheng all sold. Gulifu and Fuchang suddenly sold, falling to 26 yuan, and goods advanced to nine yuan. However, because Datong came out with June 25, and Pangen filled July US dollars at half a yuan, Yuansheng Yong and Zhaofengchang competed to sell, and broke 20 yuan again, falling to 16.5 yuan. Pangen advanced August US dollars at 25 yuan. Hengyu, Tongyi, Daxing, and Yongfen advanced to 26 yuan. Although Datong came out with May US dollars at 875, and went to 18 yuan, because Sumitomo and others colluded with June US dollars at 25, Xianghe Yuankang, Xiangxiang Yuanchun competed to buy, and rushed to 32 yuan. Yifeng Yong and Shenkang competed to sell, gradually retreating. HSBC's listing was announced, with shillings rising by 125 and the US dollar rising by half a yuan. Mitsui again offered May US dollars at 24 yuan. Yuansheng Yong and Hengxing came up to sell, and immediately retreated to 20 yuan. Huabi also offered this month's US dollars at 875. Fuchang, Hengxing, Yuanheng, Qianchang, and Xiangchang all took advantage of the low prices to advance to 8 yuan, and then retreated to 4.5 yuan. Dongya dug up August US dollars at 125, and retail investors all raised to around 30 yuan. Qingfa Yong and Fuchang even went up to 33 yuan. Hengxing limited the market and wanted to sell but could not. Before long, this month's US dollars could be settled at 4 yuan. Hengyu and goods were all sold, forming downstream. Huabi filled July US dollars at 6875. Fuchang and Hengyu again sold to 1.5 yuan. Zhifeng Yong vigorously advanced. Huabi also dug up June US dollars at 4375, to 30 yuan and 5 cents. The banks continued to fill. Hengxing, Daxing Yong, and Fuchang came out again, for 22 yuan. After this, the market situation improved. May US dollars at 24 yuan were difficult to settle, because Huabi needed them. Yuansheng Yong advanced, jumping to over 30 yuan. HSBC also ate August US dollars at 25 yuan. Daxing Yong and Yifeng Yong advanced to 35.5 yuan. Huabi and others again formed a fill-out. Hengxing still came to sell, and retreated to 27.5 yuan. Finally, because August US dollars at 875 were still difficult to settle, Qianchangxiang and others accepted, gradually rising to a closing price of 934 yuan. After the market closed, Qianchangxiang, Runchangyu continued to accept, rising to over 7 yuan, and goods were then auctioned at 7 yuan.</p>
<p>The later market opened at 937.5 yuan, and goods opened at 8.5 yuan, so first reached 9 yuan. Tongyi came up to sell, retreating to 6 yuan. Before long, Shenkang also came out, forming downstream. Huabi came out with May US dollars at 875. Hengyu, Tongyi, and Fuchang all sold, and then retreated to 2.5 yuan. Daxing Yong advanced to 5.5 yuan. Bingxing came out again, for 3 yuan. Huabi ate August US dollars at 9375. Zhifeng Yong advanced to around 7 yuan. Huabi filled July US dollars at half a yuan. Richang came on the stage to sell, gradually retreating. Jincheng came out with August US dollars at 25 yuan, for 2 yuan. Hengxing and others slightly sold, further falling to 28.5 yuan. Mitsui ate August US dollars at 25 yuan. Hongli, Yuankangxiang, and Xianghe and others advanced, and were still able to pull up. Although Hengxing came to sell from time to time, because Yuanheng Runchangyu and others advanced, it was still rising. When Huabi ate May US dollars at 24 yuan, Dadecheng advanced to 35 yuan. Zhejiang came out with July 625, forming downstream again. Zhaofengchang sold to 30 yuan. Hengxing initially advanced, raising to 3 yuan and still falling. Wanxing continued to advance, rising from 29.5 yuan to around 34 yuan. Mitsui Magali all ate August 9375. Qianchangxiang Yuankangxiang advanced to 6 yuan. Huabi came out with July 5625. Fuchang sold. Zhaofengchang sold even more, to within 30 yuan, because Shanghai Xingye all offered July 625. After this, the news was unfavorable. Shenkang sold fiercely to 27 yuan. Magali dug up August 5 yuan. Yuansheng Yong advanced, and could still struggle. After entering, this price for August was difficult to sell. Shenkang continued to sell, and goods were also sold, falling to 23 yuan. Yuanmaoyong slightly advanced, and the closing price was then 926.5 yuan. After the market closed, Bingxing Zhaofengchang all accepted, to over 30 yuan, and Wanxing also had an advance, and goods were auctioned at 28 yuan. Checking the highest price of the day was 940 yuan, and the lowest price was 916.5 yuan, with a fluctuation of 23.5 yuan. The result was a slight increase of 1.5 yuan compared to the previous Saturday.</p>
<p>The listed price was because HSBC's US dollar listing rose by half a yuan, calculated at 23.125 yuan. The alloy price was over 1037 yuan. According to the closing price, about 111 yuan was pressed, which was 24 yuan less than the previous Saturday. This month's registration was 961 yuan, May was 955 yuan, and June was 934 yuan. The morning supplementary water was 961 yuan. In the later market, this month's registration was 954 yuan, May was 948 yuan, and June was 927 yuan. The afternoon supplementary water was 954 yuan.

The near-term opening of the US exchange was 23.5 yuan, which was 125 tighter than the previous Saturday, mainly because the gross opening price of the gold market rebounded, and reports stated that the British Prime Minister proposed a general international restoration of the gold standard, and people's minds were stable. However, after opening, the banks immediately filled up, so it gradually hardened. After entering, Reuters Telegraph had even more favorable news for silver prices, and it was even looser, but it soon stabilized. HSBC's listing was announced with British rising by 125 and the American dollar rising by half a yuan. Afterwards, it gradually stabilized.

<p>There were slight receipts and payments in the long-term delivery yesterday. Ningbo Zhuang's loans matured and were transferred for more than four hundred thousand. The silver and money industry on this street made new transactions for more than three hundred thousand. Deposits were paid in three or four hundred thousand, and seven or eight hundred thousand were recovered. In addition, there were a large number of cases where the loans could not be recovered upon maturity, and the other party strongly requested that they be transferred as is, totaling more than three million. In addition, in terms of interest rates, because the swap interest rate has not been high recently, this long-term interest rate cannot be too high. It is probably five cents lower than the end of last year.</p>
<h3>Securities and public bonds show signs of squeezing</h3>
<p>The rising wind is sharp... each rises one or two or three to eight or nine cents. Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange was quite excellent, because of the victory in the previous enemy battle, and the Japanese also said that they did not want to take Beiping and Tianjin immediately and retreat to the Great Wall. In addition, the number of deposits in this month is still huge, and the environment is good, which has aroused many squeezes, arbitrage, and long-term swaps. When the market opened in the morning, the rising wind was very sharp, and the reduction of troops suddenly rose by one yuan and three cents, and the Northern Gang needed it very much. In the second market, there were many long-term swaps, and the market was slightly tired by two or three cents, but there were also several kinds that were still slightly better by one cent or five cents. The transactions in both markets were extremely prosperous, and the turnover reached more than eight million. When the market opened in the afternoon, No. 44 bought the most, and the market price turned from tired to high, so the reorganization was slightly tired, and the reduction of troops was stable. After entering, they all rose by four or five cents again. At the closing, the Northern Gang still had an appetite, and No. 11 and No. 35 bought a larger number, so the market price became</p>
<p>The higher and higher it was raised, it rose another five or six cents. Looking at the trend of the whole day, it was quite sharp, mainly because the environment created a squeeze. Today is the last day of this month, and there must be a fierce competition. As a result, the market price rose unanimously, mostly at one, two or three to one, eight or nine cents, and only one or eight openings rose by only four cents and five cents, and the reorganization only rose by six cents. The total number of transactions was a total of 16,626,900 yuan, including 4,000 yuan in cash. The total amount of futures salt tax accounted for 6.42 million yuan, the reduction of troops accounted for 2,225,000 yuan, the 19 customs duty accounted for 3,010,000 yuan, and the 20-roll 20-customs duty accounted for 3,475,000 yuan, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>
<h3>New York stocks suddenly advanced again</h3>
<p>New Feng Foreign Company reported on Saturday (22nd) last week that the New York stock market initially tended to be tired, but later, due to a good railway freight report, a total of 494,215 vehicles were used in the week ending April 15. Railway stocks first rebounded, and market buying increased sharply. The market rose sharply, and short selling was squeezed quite severely. Also, gold stocks have created new highs this year due to the expansion trend. Holmes Stock Gold Mine closed at 203 yuan, with a half-day turnover of 2,275,500 shares. Looking at the current stock market situation, the market situation may continue to rise. If the prices of American metallurgy, Barton condensed milk, Cologne Olive cosmetics, General Foods, Phillips kerosene, Canadian Railway, Chrysler Motors, building materials, and Kinahao Copper Mine are currently extremely cheap, they can all be purchased. The hope for medium-grade bonds is also good. However, the prospect of the best-grade public bonds will inevitably be more pessimistic due to the threat of inflation and gold devaluation. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left, and the closing price is higher than the previous day's 30 industrial stocks 72.34, up 2.46, 20 railway stocks 30.66, up 1.15, 20 public utility stocks 23.17, up 0.53, and 40 bonds 74.35, up 0.25.</p>
<h3>Yarn and flower bid yarn have a slight twist</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, because the actual demand is less than yesterday, and people's minds are slightly calmer, but large households still buy when prices fall, and the market is still stable, but the market is rumored to be full of rumors, saying that the factory has a way to deal with 30,000 bales of stored yarn, so both long and short sellers are unstable. In short, the fundamental problem lies in the actual demand.</p>
<h3>Ren Biao The general trend is stable</h3>
<p>The market opened flat in the Ren Jiqian market, and the atmosphere was extremely calm. The selling of the second and third markets increased slightly, and the prices fell by five or six cents. At the closing, large households bought fiercely and rose again. As a result, the prices of each month rose by one, two or six cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that there were not many spot sales, and the market atmosphere was slightly tired, with each month falling by two, four or six cents. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 38,000 bales. It was found that Yikang sold 1,050 bales, Mingde 750 bales, Xiesheng 750 bales, Yongda 1,100 bales, and Yiyu 1,350 bales. Rongxing bought 1,350 bales, Lichang 1,100 bales, Shenji 850 bales, and Suilong 600 bales. The closing prices are as follows: Ren Biao closing price rose and fell, and the number of deposits was July 1911, down 454,900, April 1865, up 415,500, August 1933, 239,650, May 1885, 140,750, September 1945, 33,750, June 1896, down 448,750, totaling 233,300.</p>
<h3>Yarn sales are relatively degraded</h3>
<p>The depletion of existing yarn is less than before. It is found that all the gangs bought a total of 784 bales throughout the day, and the market price rose by five cents to one yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows: Sichuan 300, Guangdong 75, Ningbo 4, Luzhou 10, colleagues 185, Datong 5, inland 120, Zhenjiang 5, Changsha 50, Shantou 20.</p>
<h3>Large households buy standard flowers</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending firm, and the market atmosphere is quite strong, because large households are buying, but the factory is implementing reduced labor, and has no intention of entering the raw materials. In addition, the overseas situation is not good, and the silver price is still rising. The calculated silver price of foreign cotton is not expensive, but it is said that long-term buyers in this port are buying more and increasing the price.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Market State is Consolidated</h3>
<p>Zheng Biao opened in the pre-market, and the market atmosphere was relatively expensive, with each month rising by one dime and a half. The second and third markets rose again, with each month rising by one dime and a half to three dimes and a half. The afternoon market opened quite expensively. After the auction reached the second and third markets, the long-term settlement was slightly tired, and each month rose by five cents. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 91,500 dans. It was found that Tongfu sold 6,000 dans, Zhenda 2,000 dans, Shenchang 2,800 dans, Yuanda 10,500 dans, and Yikang 2,200 dans. Lichang bought 5,800 dans, Yuchang 5,800 dans, Yuanxingchang 4,900 dans, and Renfeng 2,600 dans. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Biao closing price rose and fell, and the number of deposits was July 4330, up 40122,200, April 4165, up 535,800, August 435530116,800, May 42351579,000, total 462,100, June 429530108,300.</p>
<h3>Fragmented factory needs are frequent</h3>
<p>The current cotton business is still fragmented, and the needs are still constantly lacking. Huoji flower 41.25 Zhenxinjin 300 bales of spot goods are sent to Wuxi Shandong American species 44.00 Zhenxinjin 1,500 dans of spot goods are sent to Wuxi New Kent flower 41.55 Zhenxinjin 200 bales of spot goods are sent to Wuxi Huoji flower 41.00 Fuxingjin 500 bales of spot goods are sent to Wuxi and 40.00 Xinjin 300 bales of spot goods are sent to the factory.</p>
<h3>Silk and tea Overseas silk prices are turning firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York silk market showed a high price of one dollar and forty-seven cents again, and Yokohama also rose by fifteen yuan, totaling seven hundred and eighty yuan. Because of the long rotation of the ballot, and because there was no overseas entry on Monday, the silk market in this port had few transactions. It is estimated that the transaction was 10 packages of Hushan brand 13.15, with a price of 728 yuan, and 20 packages of Nanxun brand 13.15, with a price of 782 yuan. According to the current situation, the Hague silk market is quite stable, or it may continue to rise, which is also expected. However, the rise in silk prices is often accompanied by the silver price, so the Shanghai market price cannot rise at the same time as the overseas silk price, and the quality of the stored silk varies, and most of it is not suitable for foreign silk factories. Unless the new cocoon is on the market, the transaction may not be fully accessible.</p>
<h3>A glimpse of the current situation of Jiangxi tea companies</h3>
<p>Fuliang is difficult to open, and Dexing continues to stop</p>
<p>There are 60 to 70 tea companies in various villages in Fuliang. Although there is no heat like last year, there are still many who rent estates and find ways to open up. The appearance of the market seems no less than in previous years, but in reality, most of them only rent an estate address. The amount of funds has not yet been prepared. The purpose is to hope that the home delivery will turn looser, receive a little bit of tea money, and then buy mountain prices to help. What awaits until now, when the new tea will be picked, the home delivery still focuses on tightening on speculative numbers, so these tea companies that have no money to call out, because they cannot receive the delivery money, are all in a state of parking. It is estimated that there are about 20 tea companies that are difficult to open in the four villages. Others are of a temporary nature. With such a lack of silver, opening is even more of a dream. In recent days, the Jingzhen money shop has been crowded with tea tickets, and the discount for every thousand has risen to 20 yuan, which is a huge loss compared to the discount of three or four yuan for every thousand in Tunxi.</p>
<p>Dexing has always been an important tea-producing area in northern Jiangxi. Since Fang Shao's red bandits invaded and occupied the area in the 17th year, there has been no tea market to speak of. The tea trees in the four villages could not be cultivated due to the banditry, and most of them were barren. The development of new tea could not be picked and made in time. Although there is no rampage like in previous years in Dexing, the important areas are guarded by the national army, but the local area has suffered repeated destruction, and the vitality has been greatly lost. Honest merchants are afraid of the bandits and do not want to take the risk of operating, so this year's Dexing tea market is still in a state of stagnation and has no possibility of recovery.</p>
<h3>Food He Xia Mi continues to rise</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 30 sources, and the scattered stomach was still alive, and the market was tight. Bao stomach Tianjin Yantai and other gangs adopted green corners and other thin rice thousand bags, and the same thick geng thousand bags, so the situation was lively. The prices of green corners and the same Ligang rice have risen by a large corner. Duyangjian has also seen a good trend, but the market for Bian Yuan is sluggish and has fallen by a small corner. Yin Yuan has no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources in He Xia. The white geng's depletion was weak, and the market was neither honorable nor disgraceful. The arrival and consumption of thin rice were both in harmony, and the price tended to be stable. The arrival of early rice was small and the consumption was lively, and the price increased by nearly one foot. Xian rice was stable, and Yin Yuan and Bian Yuan did not fluctuate much.</p>
<h3>Only a Slight Uptick in Flour and Wheat Prices</h3>
<p>After the morning opening of the flour market, prices for all months are temporarily stable. Regarding the quoted price of foreign wheat, American wheat is up by 67 cents, and Canadian wheat is up by one dollar. After the opening price, prices seem to be stable. Due to the rising trend of commodity prices abroad, people's hearts have inevitably turned bullish, and buying interest has also slightly livened up. Compared to the closing price of the previous day, near and far terms seem to be better by about one cent. It can be seen that the domestic price level is currently not the same as the international market. Until the afternoon opening price, the current month is still stable, but for the far-term months, each factory is selling separately. Although the quantity is not very strong, people are worried about it, so the opening price has softened again. The intention of each factory is that the sales in the north cannot be greatly improved for a while, and the wheat reserves are very abundant, so they still sell whenever they have the opportunity. As a result, the prices for April, May, and June are better by two and a half cents compared to the previous day, while the prices for July, August, and September have not changed. As for the spot price of "warship" wheat, it is quoted at two dollars and forty-five cents, which seems to be higher than the standard.</p>
<p>The market for wheat in all months, both morning and afternoon, is nearly stable in the near and far terms. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat has risen by 67 cents to one dollar, the spot foreign wheat in this port is really abundant. The appetite of each factory for wheat does not seem to be urgent. The situation in the current month has been slightly down by one cent due to the floating profit-taking. The far-term is slightly better because inland merchants have a slight intention to purchase, and not many short sellers are blocking. However, based on the current situation of foreign wheat, it will be difficult for the standard wheat to continue to be good. As a result, the price for the current month is slightly down by one cent, July is up by two cents, August is up by three cents, and September is up by one cent.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Merchants Buying Large Quantities of Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Purchasing 12,500 Bags of Small-Sized Rice</p>
<p>Following the activity in the foreign rice market in recent weeks, merchants from other regions also showed interest in trading. Yesterday, merchants from Ningbo came to the market to inquire, and Anli Trading Company offered a discount of three cents based on the market price to accommodate them. Ningbo merchants were eager to unite with local firms to purchase in large quantities and immediately reached a deal with Anli for 12,500 bags of small-sized rice, priced at an estimated 7 dollars and 29 cents. This street also responded to a Saigon rice purchase of 200 bags, with the price remaining at 7 dollars and 80 cents. There had been no large-scale transactions for many days, and yesterday's purchase by this large merchant was very encouraging, with a positive outlook for the future market. In addition to the active purchase of foreign rice, Ningbo merchants also bought 500 bags of Jiangxi Jiwan rice. Local Xiang rice has been very active in trading recently, and the Fujian rice trade is still strong. When Ningbo merchants inquired again yesterday, the price suddenly jumped by two cents to one cent, with 1,800 bags of Jiangxi Jiwan rice opening at 8 dollars and 30 cents to 7 dollars and 84 cents, 62 bags of Jizao rice at 7 dollars and 39 cents, 300 bags of Hunan Jiayou rice at 8 dollars and 55 cents, 500 bags of Jihong rice at 7 dollars and 94 cents and 5 points, and 105 bags of rough oil at 6 dollars and 77 cents. After the recent active trading of local Xiang rice, merchants are showing interest in trading again, but there are no actual shipments yet. However, the Xiang and Gan rice stored in Hankou by hoarding merchants is selling very well in Shanghai, and yesterday another 3,000 bags were shipped by the Gonghe and Xiangtai boats, but all with limited prices.</p>
<h3>Influx of Second-Grade White Lead Sheets Causes Sharp Drop in Prices</h3>
<p>In the past week, the price of second-grade white lead sheets had been rising steadily due to shortages, reaching as high as 42 dollars per dan. However, at that time, tea merchants were buying in large quantities, and military factories and Tianjin merchants also added significant purchases. In the past three or four days, the Gonghexiang, New Taikoo, and other warehouses have received shipments totaling more than 200 barrels, while tea merchants have stopped buying and only engage in sporadic transactions. Moreover, since the cost of this commodity is low, all businesses are competing to sell it off. The market price has weakened by more than three dollars, with each dan dropping to around 38 dollars. However, based on the recent thinking of various businesses, it is feared that the market price will be very difficult to recover in the future.</p>
<h3>The Terrifying Plummet of Pure Antimony</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of pure antimony was only 316 or 317 dollars per ton, a sharp drop of 13 or 14 dollars compared to before. There were still few transactions. The reason for this price drop is that there is too much inventory in the producing areas, and credit is extremely tight. Therefore, antimony merchants in Hunan are finding it difficult to operate and have to let go at a painful price to maintain their livelihoods. Given the sluggish business of foreign firms and the lack of transactions in military factories, printing houses, and furnaces, it is unlikely that the market will improve in the short term.</p>

<h3>On Profiteers</h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>(Profiteer) is a bad name. There is the risk of being spat upon and cursed, and there is the possibility of standing in a wooden cage. Perhaps since the word (merchant) existed, this is the most unlucky. However, the human heart is ultimately unpredictable, and there are many who are willing to become profiteers. The motivation, it is said, is not curiosity, but for profit.</p>
<p>(The world bustles for profit), and when it comes to (profit), who doesn't get envious? It is no wonder that they rush towards it like swift horses. However, (profit) and (harm) are often intertwined. Where there is profit, there is also harm. It's just that human understanding is often blinded by (what is liked), and fails to follow the correct principles. So even though the harm has not been discovered, it has already come along with the profit. As a result, those who are greedy for small profits suffer great harm, and those who are greedy for immediate gains have long-term worries. Everything goes against the original purpose, and it's all due to a mistake in the initial thought.</p>
<p>Worldly affairs are often contradictory, and human beings often lack self-awareness. Guessing the psychology of general profiteers, they think (what does the country have to do with me)? But they don't realize that being able to become a profiteer depends on having such a fragmented country.</p>
<p>For example, anyone can sell cloth that costs one dollar and two or three feet. They surely want to make a few more coins, and they need you to get a piece of the pie. This is really not the action of a fool or selflessness but there is an inescapable reason as to why you must get something out of it. This doesn't need to be stated explicitly, but without the signboard of this (Republic of China), could this business be done?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if rice costs ten dollars a stone, and the enemy is willing to pay three or four times the price to buy it, there was a profiteer who sacrificed himself at the Chen Ying Shi Memorial Tower during the January 28th Incident. It was certainly not because he was dissatisfied with money or admired the ancient customs of the (Land of Gentlemen). But it was also because there was no way to gleefully drive military trucks and directly carry away the goods. In the end, it still depends on having this fragmented signboard. So profiteers still have to love their country. If not, they could never maintain this sign that makes money.</p>
<p>But if you love your country too much, you can't be a profiteer and can't make money. If you make too much money, you will lose your signboard and can't be a profiteer. The choice between the two requires careful consideration. The best way to have it all is to always maintain a state of semi-death. In this way, leaving money to your descendants will not come with the danger of having the title of (slave of a conquered nation), and the profiteer can pass down their smiling, round faces through generations.</p>
<p>The above is my brilliant plan for profiteers. Next, I want to tell the people of groups such as (Exterminate the Profiteers) that to completely eliminate profiteers, you must think of a brilliant way to remove the fuel from the bottom of the pot. Warning letters and bombs will not help.</p>

<h3>Written in Anguish Upon the Fall of Rehe to the Invaders</h3>
<p>— Wang Fu Ding</p>
<p>The mountains rise and fall, naturally dangerous, but the barbarian horses are unexpectedly ahead. In one night, the army retreats, losing ten thousand miles, but victories in Jiangnan are frequently reported.</p>
<p>Generals do not fight, carrying their weapons, delaying the military opportunity, losing much land. Even with the Great Wall, who can rely on it? The sound of cranes cries across the Yellow River.</p>
<p>Mistaking hawks and dogs for talents, a big mistake has been made that cannot be undone. It is difficult for the elders of Jiangdong to see me again, and I come to Chang'an on a lone horse, carrying sorrow.</p>
<h3>In Praise of Hotels</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>As the name implies, hotels are originally for traveling guests to reside in. There are many travelers in the metropolis, so hotels are most needed. However, the countryside only needs tea houses and the like, which are enough for passers-by to temporarily rest. However, the reality is very different. Obviously, the role of the current hotels is very different. Take the hotels in Shanghai, for example. There are one thousand two hundred and eight, this is still a statistic from two years ago, and now I am afraid there are more than that. Along Xizang Road, Da Ma Road, Er Ma Road,...... How many of those magnificent and towering western-style buildings are not hotels or restaurants? The equipment inside is really complete and elegant, with golden copper beds, soft and white bed curtains, convenient hot water basins, and a dazzling array of decorations, calligraphy, paintings, toys, and the like. There are also large restaurants, dance halls, billiard rooms, and golf courses. It is because it is so luxurious that its role is very different. It is not for travelers to live in, but a place for wealthy young masters and young ladies to indulge in. A huge amount of rent is paid there, and there are many kinds of petty accounts. Ordinary travelers can only stop in their tracks, and in fact travelers do not need that kind of comfort.</p>
<p>Whenever dusk falls and the lights are bright, groups of people rush in and out like a raging tide. That is the beginning of the world of night, the realm of fleshly trembling. Smoke, alcohol, fragrance, mesmerizing dances: debauchery, sinking, depravity, disillusionment, fully expose the metropolis's overflowing carnal desires, the morbid problems of the end of the century, and the boredom and disgustingness of life.</p>
<p>University student Miss Huang barely got Miss Zhang's promise to go to the movies together, after a frenzied kiss in the movie theater, felt there was a need to rent a room, so hand in hand, speaking like singing warblers, flew into the door of the hotel, and became a member of the surge of the masses.</p>
<p>The eldest Miss can't get away from the thoughtfulness and entanglement of Li Da next door. After discussing near the Tiger Stove, they sneak off together for a night at the hotel.</p>
<p>There are gambling dens there. If you feel unbearable economic pressure and want to get rich, you may as well temporarily set aside the rent, food, and all other living expenses, and temporarily use them as bait. You can also stride in and show off a night of dancing. If your pockets are temporarily empty and you still want to linger, you can go home and roll up your clothes and stuff them into the</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>pawn shop, and then go on for several more nights. Even if your pockets are empty again, that is fate, you do not need to complain to anyone, the waiters are still smiling at you, asking you to pay for snacks, and settle the petty accounts.</p>
<p>There are also opium dens there. If you feel that your dull nerves need to be anesthetized, you may as well visit. There are soft mattresses to support your waist, and delicate beauties to accompany you. If you are happy, you can make your own bubbles, otherwise, you only need to raise the muzzle of the gun, and someone will load the smoke for you. At that time, you don't need to be timid at all, just smoke gracefully, and I guarantee that there will be no dog-like bailiff to cover your eggs. The big-bellied treasurer sitting in the accounting room is your most loyal bodyguard. You don't need to ask him in advance, he will naturally ensure that you are worry-free and have no accidents at all.</p>
<p>Underground party politicians, when they have the opportunity, feel the need to unite with comrades and brothers for a close discussion before deciding on the slogans (Down with XX) (Support XX), often go to hotels to book hundreds or dozens of rooms to hold small group meetings. However, this must be kept secret, and the ceremony should be as simple as possible. If you want to read the (Premier's Will), you can only recite it silently like doing (Jesus's Prayer). Otherwise, there may be trouble, please descend from the paradise-like hotel to the hell-like iron house, at that time the bodyguard treasurer will only stare blankly, losing all his authority.</p>
<p>In addition, there are miracles and shocking stories that cannot be seen in the Grand World or the Immortal World, that is, the (public performance of sexual intercourse) that Dr. Zhang Jingsheng has not yet evolved to that level, and it is only when there are immature boys and girls as characters that it can be considered the number one top-notch play. Last year, there was even a rare masterpiece of intercourse between dogs and humans. Unfortunately, (the spring song has few responders), and it disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>In addition, there is the rush in and out of singers, prostitutes, pimps, and perverts, as well as female physiognomists wearing name cards printed with (Decline all social engagements, respectfully refuse inappropriate gifts), which is a very mediocre routine, so there is no need to describe it in detail.</p>
<p>This is why the hotels in the metropolis are hotels, and why the hotel industry is particularly developed! How prosperous! This is the eve of the collapse of the present society! This is the praise.</p>
<h3>A Vague Recollection</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>It was in my childhood, a drought-stricken afternoon in early autumn, and lunch was still being cooked on the earthen stove with firewood, (gurgling, gurgling) like medicine. After my father saw Zhang Sanbo off from Yangjiao Chong, he returned to the kitchen with a frown and said to my mother: (I thought that even if I urged them, there wouldn't be a large number of troops coming to the countryside. Seeing this drought and famine, I didn't expect it to actually happen. According to the news Zhang Sanbo heard, they will definitely come to our house this afternoon. You women should take the children and run away!)</p>
<p>(This is not a joke. There are ten or so fierce soldiers with guns, and they say there is even a mounted commander! They are killing chickens and ducks in the bay, and the whole family is turned upside down. Sun Shengwu was even chained and shackled. I even want to run away, you guys should escape first!) My father was a little choked up.</p>
<p>After my mother heard this, she slowly moved her feet towards the inner room in a terrifying atmosphere. I followed closely and saw her lifting the corner of her right clothes to wipe her eyes, hastily picking up He Mei's diapers along with my quilted jacket and packing them up. She said: (Go to your second sister's house to see Mao Mao (a newborn baby), to be a guest where there is food to eat, it won't be like drinking porridge water at home, come with me, quickly!)</p>
<p>We walked out of the mountain gate, and my father was already standing on the large stone beside the door, staring at the road from the bay.</p>
<p>(I will send you the news tonight no matter what!) My father rolled his eyes and said: (Okay, let's run away! You have to pay attention yourself, don't offend them, they are the ones urging the payment of military expenses for the country!) Your mother repeatedly instructed: (Go, go, go to your second sister's house!) I was pulling on the corner of my mother's clothes and jumping, jumping wildly without understanding anything. When we reached the large road in the fields, I pointed to a sturdy rice plant and asked: (Mom, why are our rice plants all dried up, but there is still a good one here?) (This is Longtian, there is water, don't you know that ours are all Tian? See if there is any Tian that is not as dry as a rocket? It's really God's will!) My mother explained as she walked, and her spirit seemed very anxious. At that time, I didn't quite understand the principles my mother was talking about, especially the phrase (God's will), which simply made me feel like I (couldn't find my head).</p>
<p>Suddenly a group of people and horses emerged from the mountain ahead. I wanted to get closer to see, but my mother scolded me sternly, pinched my ear and walked away on a small path. I did not see very clearly. But she always peeked at the route of that group of people and horses, which was the way we had just come, so her pace slowed down, but she sometimes stumbled on the road stones.</p>
<p>After crossing the ridge, there was a slope of twenty or thirty degrees. The crops on the side of the road were all as red as rockets, and the setting sun made it impossible for us to breathe.</p>
<p>My mother and second sister were just chattering about something on the edge of the bed. I was eating rice cakes that my second sister gave me. My second sister's kitchen was just starting a fire. Suddenly my eldest brother came over and said breathlessly: (Mom, Mom, go back, father has been arrested, and the house has been turned upside down.) So we hurried back again. Although my mother hadn't eaten anything all day, she walked much faster than when she came. She also stuffed the four cooked eggs that her second sister gave her into my bag. At this time, Bao Mei was carried away by my eldest brother first.</p>
<p>When we arrived home, three chickens, two ducks, and a pig were all gone, and the whole family was in a mess. Only the lunch porridge was still being cooked on the earthen stove with firewood, (gurgling, gurgling) like medicine.</p>
<p>This is a piece of my childhood memories. I wanted to let it go, but it got more and more entangled. Every time I recall it, it is a wave of loss.</p>
<h3>The Face of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ge Lang</p>
<p>(After Little Tu's wife arrived in Shanghai, she heard that she had been promoted to (Na Mawen) after working in the yarn factory for less than two years, and now her monthly salary is more than thirty dollars. Little Tu is really lucky, and now he can rely on his wife for food. He also ran to Shanghai the day before yesterday.) The Wang Ma Daddy next door said to his woman, sighing with envy.</p>
<p>(Shanghai is different from the countryside after all, it's easier to earn money. Think about it: more than thirty dollars, it takes a year for Mom (maid) to earn that in the countryside!) Aunt Wang Si, sewing shoe uppers in her hand, also expressed her envy in response.</p>
<p>It turned out that Wang Ma Daddy and Wang Si Aunt had not seen (the face of Shanghai). If they saw it, they definitely wouldn't be able to sing this kind of praise.</p>
<p>I can swear that Little Tu really didn't have the idea of ​​relying on his wife for food when he came to Shanghai this time, but he did have the imagination of finding a better job.</p>
<p>However, ideals do not match reality after all. Little Tu ran to Shanghai and circled for two full months, but still didn't find a job. The twenty-five old ocean dollars spent on selling five stones of grain was used up! He couldn't go home, so he had to stay at his wife's place, taking care of cooking, washing dishes, and fetching water... Of course, Little Tu's wife didn't have any problems with his (bad luck).</p>
<p>Five o'clock has passed, and the sky is not yet bright. Little Tu got up, fanned the charcoal stove red, cooked the meal, went to boil water, and then leaned on the pillow and gently woke up the woman.</p>
<p>As soon as she got up, she wiped her high-heeled leather shoes for five minutes, then washed her face, applied snow cream, looked in the mirror twice, picked up the bowls and chopsticks, took a few hasty bites, put on her cloak and coat, and prepared to enter the factory.</p>
<p>(The weather outside is not good, do you want to take an umbrella?) Little Wang asked in a hushed voice while wiping the table. (Haven't people died yet! Should I send it to the factory?) She said, slamming the door (with a bang), and left by herself.</p>
<p>Really! The face of Little Tu's wife, from birth to now, has indeed had four different patterns statistically. The first one everyone has not seen, because she did not come to Shanghai; the second one is the one she just showed Little Tu; as for the third and fourth, of course, the yarn factory must be used as her background.</p>
<p>(Mr. Xu! I'm here. Do you have any instructions today? Hee hee!) The sound of Little Tu's wife's leather shoes (clack) (clack) resounded into the office, she signed the signature book with a cross, walked up to the labor officer and asked with a smile (Good morning).</p>
<p>(Watch them so they don't slack off! Write down the names of those who make bad cloth. If they don't listen, just hit them with a stick! The rest of the words you understand in your heart, no need to say more.) Foreman Xu turned down his voice from a solemn tone and returned a smile.</p>
<p>Little Tu's wife stepped over the threshold of the cloth machine room and immediately took off her cloak and coat, revealing a crimson silk gauze cheongsam and shiny long stockings. Among the eighty or ninety female workers, she can indeed be considered (a crane among chickens). Her first words were: (Everyone pay attention! Life is getting worse and worse! If this continues, no wages will be paid at all, how will you survive? It's not that I, Na Mawen, am cruel, but there's nothing you can do if you don't strive yourself?) As she spoke, her face seemed to show (Seventy Crow) spirit. Then she said:</p>
<p>(Little sister Wang, Li Cui'e come over! You two little pigs are the worst: fighting with people all day long, not caring about life, today broken cloth, tomorrow broken head, it's all done by you two little pigs!) After she said that, she pulled the ears of the two child laborers a few times and ordered them to go back.</p>
<p>The sound of the cloth machine's motor (rumbling) resounded, and everyone was bowing their heads, weaving and weaving. No one ever noticed what the fifth face of Little Tu's wife looked like. However, some people say that Little Tu's wife originally only had one face, and the remaining three were cast by Shanghai. If she saw it herself, she would definitely deny it. Therefore, it can only be said that this is (The Face of Shanghai)! I couldn't help but nod in agreement when I heard these words. Saying repeatedly (Right! Right!)</p>

<p>Store Employee Communications</p>
<h3>The Way of Husband and Wife is Bitter</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor,</p>
<p>I have a difficult problem that constantly lingers in my mind, and I cannot resolve it. In moments of extreme (depression) and (frustration), I even contemplate suicide. Although I am exerting myself to (struggle) and (fight), I still haven't found a satisfactory solution. I often read your Q&amp;A column for store employees in your newspaper, which has answered many difficult questions and provided very thorough guidance. Now, I earnestly implore you, Mr. Editor, to provide guidance and answers to my problem, for which I would be immensely grateful.</p>
<p>I am a (male wife), ridiculed and looked down upon. Unfortunately, I lost my father at the age of three and my mother at the age of fourteen. I have no elder siblings and no younger siblings; I am a very pitiful orphan. Fortunately, I had a close uncle who sent me to work as an apprentice in a small general store in a town more than thirty miles from my hometown. Knowing the pain of my own background, I worked hard and diligently and was highly valued by my master. When I turned seventeen, my master had a relative whose only son died. Thanks to my master's kindness, he introduced me to marry into that relative's family. Initially, I had some understanding of human affairs and was somewhat unwilling to become a (male wife) who would change my name and surname. However, after being persuaded by sweet words and considering my family's poverty, I agreed to this lifelong regret.</p>
<p>At first, my uncle and aunt strongly opposed this matter, but seeing that I had made up my mind, they let me proceed. My ideal was to rely on others to achieve future development, and I thought that a name was just a symbol of life, so it didn't matter. But I realized that it was completely the opposite of my ideal. After I married into the family, within a few years, my father-in-law arranged for me to work as a junior clerk in a domestic goods factory in this city. Since entering the factory, I had to send two-thirds of my salary, earned by my sweat and blood, to my father-in-law every month. I mistakenly thought that this was their kindness, fearing that I would waste the money, and they were saving it for me, so I didn't argue with them and sent it every month.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my uncle's son died last year. My uncle and aunt lost their source of livelihood. The two old people are old and frail, so how will they maintain their lives in the future? Driven by my conscience, seeing the plight of my uncle and aunt, I naturally supplemented them with some money from my own savings. When my (domineering wife) found out about this, she rushed to Shanghai, launching a punitive expedition, declaring that I must give them all my monthly salary, otherwise, she would not allow me to work in Shanghai. They were unwilling to understand my difficulties at all, and they came to make a scene every month because I didn't send them money. I couldn't bear it anymore and resisted them several times. As a result, the resentment deepened day by day, and the feelings between husband and wife completely broke down.</p>
<p>What joy is there for a person to reach this point? Whenever I think of this, my attitude tends to be negative, and I want to abandon myself and end my life, or simply die. But these two paths are not a problem for my wife's family, because I already have a son and a daughter, and my wife's family has some property that can sustain their lives. But what about my elderly uncle and aunt? I cannot strive, and negativity is not good. The mental suffering and economic pressure I endure have almost reached their peak. Continuing like this will only shorten my life.</p>
<p>May I ask, Mr. Editor, how can I escape this evil family, regain my freedom, relieve my suffering, and prevent my elderly uncle and aunt from suffering from cold and hunger? I earnestly request your guidance.</p>
<p>Respectfully wishing you good health.</p>
<p>Yu Huichu, April 22nd</p>
<p>Editor's Note:</p>
<p>The true meaning of marriage lies in the cooperation between a man and a woman. Therefore, both parties must have a spirit of mutual respect and assistance. It is certainly wrong for a man to regard a woman as his private property and dispose of her at will. However, it is also wrong for a woman to regard a man as her private property and insult him at will. Therefore, we believe that marriage is fundamentally not about (who marries whom). They are simply living together because they love each other. A husband should certainly have due respect for his wife's family, and a wife should also have due respect for her husband's relatives. Now, the concept of Yu Jun's wife's family is nothing more than thinking that Yu Jun is one of their people, and everything he has should be entirely under their control. As for Yu Jun's relatives, it would be best to sever contact with them to please their hearts. Now, not only can you not understand their intentions, but you are also using money to support your uncle, which, in their eyes, is truly outrageous. Judging from this, Yu Jun's wife's family simply does not understand the true meaning of marriage. Such a couple's way of life is indeed bitter. Therefore, we approve of Yu Jun's attitude. You should help your uncle and aunt, who have taken care of you since childhood, in their miserable old age, according to your conscience. As for dealing with your wife's family, you don't necessarily have to negotiate with them in any way. You only need to be determined and go your own way, simply ignoring them. It would be best if you could find a way to leave your current job recommended by your wife's family. Since they were determined to recruit a son-in-law in the first place, it goes without saying that they value the family line. After a long time, your wife, since she cannot remarry, will probably have to accommodate you for the sake of the family line, won't she?</p>

<h3>Times in a Dream (Continued 36)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"These are still the ones who don't amount to much! The Chinese who amount to something don't do this!" Old Zhang, wearing the badge of a member of the XX Province Volunteer Army Support Association's fundraising team, split open the bamboo tube he had been carrying on his back all day in his home and lamented to his wife with great disappointment: "(Damn it! Today is really unlucky! I worked all day and only got this pile of copper coins and small change, not even a single silver dollar note!)"</p>
<p>"(Since the January 28th Incident, we should know the importance of airplanes,...Join this association as a basic member, pay an annual fee of ten yuan, or an ordinary member, pay an annual fee of two yuan. A badge will be given upon joining the association, and publications will be given every month....Membership is not limited by nationality,...)"</p>
<p>Dr. X, a popular figure in the educational field who had become notorious for misusing public funds, suddenly had the whimsical idea of launching an (Airplane Save the Nation Association). Using badges as a gimmick, he learned the tricks of the girls on Dongxin Bridge and pulled in a lot of members. The airplanes probably had to wait until the Republic of China was destroyed before they could be bought, but the president's car was taken care of first.</p>
<p>Thus, since the September 18th Incident, in addition to the existing 360 professions, a new emerging industry has been added to society: saving the nation. How many save-the-nation groups are there in total, XX Association, XX Association? Heaven knows! (If the people's spirit is like this, the nation can be saved!) The general public, with their outdated thinking and relatively simple minds, and elderly people, were really dazzled by this motley spectacle, thinking that the save-the-nation movement was so enthusiastic that China probably wouldn't be destroyed after all, and couldn't help but feel secretly gratified. Wu Yi was one of them.</p>
<p>Wu Yuan's departure caused him to fall into a coma for three or four months in the Drum Tower Hospital, as if he were in a deep sleep. His mind was subjected to the most violent stimulation, even more painful than the scene thirty years ago when his mother was angered to death by his debauchery. He had almost lost the courage to continue living. However, after his son left, he wrote a letter to the student union of X University, lightly shifting the responsibility for releasing Wang Guodong from his father to himself. Therefore, the students of X University still supported him enthusiastically, and his top student, Minister X, did not approve his resignation. Because no one was happy to shoulder this wet log, both sides rushed to the hospital at the same time after he left the hospital, urging him to return to his post immediately.</p>
<p>Although the attitude of those who urged him to return was very sincere and enthusiastic, he himself was absolutely unwilling to return to school. The so-called "the ball is in my court." No matter how you persuade me, I am the one who decides whether to go or not, so the students could do nothing. Later, since the department did not send anyone to take over, and the official documents of the school still used the name (Wu Yi), he unknowingly resumed his puppet life.</p>
<p>(In the future, I will completely devote my time to unpaid save-the-nation work, otherwise, how can I be worthy of my son)? Wu Yi confessed to his wife with tears streaming down his face. At that time, news of Wu Yuan had been cut off for more than a month.</p>

<h3>Hollywood is About to Collapse Completely</h3>
<p>— Sipin</p>
<p>Numerous Stars Leaving One After Another</p>
<p>The End is Near and Irreversible</p>
<p>After the raging tide of the world's economic depression swept Hollywood into the vortex, the world's film industry's headquarters had already begun to shake. Now, the situation is getting worse and worse. Many famous male and female stars are leaving one after another. Hollywood is in a state of panic, from shaking to collapse. Most movie stars live a luxurious life. After the salary reduction trend in Hollywood, the actors, those who were unemployed before are still unemployed, and those who were not unemployed are now feeling the poverty of not being able to make ends meet. In particular, famous stars feel the sadness of losing the golden age most acutely.</p>
<p>In the past, during the peak of the film industry, many stage performers left the stage and turned to film. In this day and age, their only way out is to return home. So many stars are going to Europe one after another. The aristocratic beautiful star Norma Shearer and her husband Helens have both booked cabins and are preparing to live in Europe for a few months. The romantic young man Ramon Novarro went to Paris on March 24 to perform singing. The newly famous Clark Gable is also preparing to take leave to go to Europe. He told people that if he cannot go to Europe, he must at least stay away from the desolate and lonely Hollywood and go hunting. After filming the film she starred in, Marlene Dietrich returned to Berlin with her husband and daughter, and it is not yet clear how long she will stay. Gary Cooper is currently co-starring in a film with Joan Crawford. After filming, he will have three months of vacation and is also preparing to go to Europe during the vacation. Jean Hersholt is also preparing to go to Denmark after filming, and then go to Germany to perform on stage alone. Dana Wynter is preparing to rest in England for six months.</p>
<p>Almost all of the male and female stars in Hollywood who have a little reputation are about to run away. Among the remaining stars who are about to go to Europe, or who have already left, are also Sifford Lai, Van Dyke, Mary Pickford, Constance Bennett, Swanson, Claude Berkeley, Charlie Rivelton, Mark Re and Herbert Marshall, etc. From this point of view, isn't Hollywood about to collapse completely?</p>
<p>Movie Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of (The Mysterious Rider)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>After watching THE MYSTERIOUS RIDER, I feel quite satisfied with the acting skills. Although the martial arts performance of the protagonist KENT TAYLOR has not better demonstrated the skills of the (knight) we imagined, and the other main actors are not very vivid either, the photography, sound recording, and the director's use of the camera are all worthy of our considerable satisfaction. Moreover, the director has also paid good attention to the progress of the whole play.</p>
<p>But what is the structure of the story in this play? Because movies are definitely not just for entertainment, every movie will inevitably leave some impressions in our minds, and even affect our concepts of life and our observations of reality. Therefore, the consciousness of this film must be explained.</p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, first, I will briefly introduce the story of this film.</p>
<p>The farmers in Nevada Valley are all happy because the construction of the dike will affect the increase in harvest and land prices. But because of legal restrictions, they have to buy the original land from a certain lawyer. Unexpectedly, the cunning lawyer resells this land to a rich man, which leads to a struggle between the farmers and the government. As a result, a knight reveals the lawyer's black幕 and peace is restored.</p>
<p>Originally, taking the struggle in the countryside as the theme is relatively new in American films. But when making movie scripts, it is often an unreasonable development. It is very obvious that they take the lawyer's crime as the focus of the play, and intentionally ignore and shift the center of this struggle. It is true that the law is often used by certain smart and powerful people as a tool of oppression or exploitation, and this point is unconsciously exposed in this play, but the (legal) interpretation is, after all, the most important conclusion of this play. Therefore, in order to be able to do so, the director has blurred the positive conflict of the climax in the dark, although these shots are very beautiful. At the same time, the insertion of (hero and beauty) is certainly a necessary condition in capitalist films, but here it is also very effective to make the audience indulge in the alcohol of (love) and ignore the development of this struggle.</p>
<p>As for the structure itself, there are also many problems, but I think they are not the main points, so I will omit them.</p>
<h3>Translation of Movie Star Names in South China</h3>
<p>— Youde</p>
<p>The Chinese translation of movie star names does not have a fixed standard in our country. The Chinese translation of movie star names in this city and in Hong Kong and Guangzhou are interestingly different due to the heavy accent and ending sounds of the language. For example, the martial arts star Fan Bingbing is translated as Phi Bing Shi in that area, the movie emperor Charlie Chaplin is translated as Cha Li Shi Hua Nu, the prison mandarin duck protagonist Kit Mars is translated as Che Shi Da Moleisi, the child prodigy Jacques Cooper is translated as Qi Guba, Pissloff is translated as Pei Shi Luo Fu, Ramon Novarro is translated as Liwen Lihuanu, the cold-faced comedian Pascatten is translated as Bo Qida Jiedun, Jenny Gaynor is translated as Zhenna Jina, Norma Shearer is translated as Namma Sila, etc. If you don't read the original English name, it's like falling into a five-mile fog. This is a common sense that people who like movies should pay attention to.</p>
<h3>(Spring Silkworms) Will Be on the Screen</h3>
<p>— Ye</p>
<p>The short story (Spring Silkworms) by the giant of the Chinese literary world, Shen Yanbing, has now been adapted into a script at the request of the Mingxing Company and is preparing to be filmed as a movie. It is also heard that the content has been added and deleted by Mr. Shen himself, and after the arrangement, it is even more exciting than before.</p>
<p>(Spring Silkworms) depicts the collapse of small owner-farmers and workers in the rapidly bankrupting Chinese countryside, and the exploitation of landlords and usurers, with an old farmer as the protagonist, narrating his self-sufficiency in his prime, his golden age, and the gradual decline to complete bankruptcy today. The arrangement is tight and the description is very profound.</p>
<h3>Sacrifice for Beauty</h3>
<p>— Zong</p>
<p>Zhu Qiuhen Endures Pain to Extract Teeth</p>
<p>In the Hollywood movie field, it can be said that things about stars sacrificing for beauty are often heard. So what about the Chinese Shanghai movie area? This kind of thing is really rarely found, but in this month of this year, Chinese movie stars have also implemented things to sacrifice for beauty:</p>
<p>I remember last year, Ms. Ai Xia of the Mingxing Company, because she felt that her eyes were too small and she was at a disadvantage in terms of performance, so she wanted to go to a scientific beauty salon to cut them, but she did not go to implement it because she did not prove the doctor's skills to be high or low by friends.</p>
<p>There are two stars who implemented it this year, one is Ms. Wang Huijuan of the Tianyi Company, because she had many black moles on her face, which was a great damage to her beauty, so she went to a scientific beauty salon for diagnosis and treatment. As a result, she went to remove the black moles and turned into white hemp! She is still acting coquettish and resenting that American doctor!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Ms. Zhu Qiuhen, because she was ordered by Mr. Zhang Shichuan, ran to a dentist's office on Avenue Joffre to have her teeth extracted. I asked her why she had her good natural teeth extracted? She said: (In the movie (The Road Ahead), I play a harlot. Harlots must be beautiful, but my teeth are really not beautiful. Mr. Shichuan told me to remodel the two big doors, so I simply cancelled the East Bianmen and West Bianmen together!) A very humorous girl spoke with a toothless mouth. Why is this? Think about it, it's pitiful! She just wants to be suitable for the beauty on the screen and win a step forward in art. When she said goodbye to me, her pain was clearly revealed on her face, and she turned her head to press a handkerchief against her lips and smiled slightly... and left!</p>
<h3>Movie Gossip in Japan</h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>There are many film companies in Japan, among which Shochiku Eiga Kabushiki Kaisha has the oldest qualifications. It has two photography studios: one in Kamata on the outskirts of Tokyo, and the other in Kamo at the foot of Kyoto. The former specializes in shooting modern films, and the latter specializes in shooting period films, that is, ancient films.</p>
<p>Most Japanese film companies shoot period films. Because in Japan, period films and modern films have the same appeal. Except for the Fuji and Irie companies, which are composed of modern film stars, other companies have period film productions. Every year, there is always a company that shoots the famous period film (Chushingura) (describing the story of the princes' ministers avenging their masters). The most strange thing is that every time this period film is screened, the audience is always crowded: In addition, because Japanese movie theaters do not have restrictions on ticket sales, the audience has those who sit and those who stand. It is really a sea of people.</p>
<p>Japanese actors are also divided into two parts: period and modern. Although they can sometimes be borrowed on both sides, in general, those who act in period films are always specialized in acting in this type of film. This is probably because the audience is used to seeing the faces of period film actors wearing wigs, and it is a bit unnatural to see their real faces!</p>
<p>Recently, the method of recruiting actresses in Japanese film companies is like this: In a big city, they place advertisements to collect photos of beautiful women who are willing to be actresses; they select dozens of the most suitable ones from inside, and then ask the local people to elect them; the elected ones can be called Miss △△. If the place is Tokyo, she will be called Miss Tokyo. These actresses are already very famous without publicity.</p>
<p>Although silent films in Japan can be called developed, sound films are still only in the experimental stage.</p>
<p>Finally, let me tell you that the Japanese call directors "supervisors," male actors "excellent actors," and female actors "excellent actresses."</p>
<h3>(Vitality) Prelude</h3>
<p>— Peiyuan</p>
<p>The new film (Vitality), recently completed by Tianyi Company, was test screened in the company's sound screening room yesterday. The film is not only tortuous in plot and perfect in consciousness, but the director's skills are truly surprisingly discovered. In addition, the softness of the light and the clarity of the sound recording are all superior to the company's previous productions. The plot is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Li Peilan, the wife of Wu Daqing, manages the family well and is indifferent to bitterness. Daqing likes to frequent brothels, and every time he returns, he is drunk. Peilan repeatedly advises him, but Daqing does not listen and scolds her in return. Later, Peilan angrily returns to her mother's house, wanting to seek independence. Later, she gets admitted to a company to work, but because she is repeatedly ridiculed by male colleagues, she resigns and learns to make clothes. Later, her business develops and she sets up a sewing factory! Many poor women come to the factory to work. At this time, Daqing is caught in speculative investment and has almost become a beggar. He has no choice but to come to the factory to find Peilan and repent of his past sins. Peilan, thinking of their past feelings, keeps him. One day, during a storm, Daqing goes to the bank to withdraw money for wages. On the way back, he meets his old flame, who forcibly invites him to her house, gets him drunk with wine, and steals his money. At this time, Peilan has already found her, so she fights with the mistress for the money. Peilan accidentally kills the mistress. The law cannot tolerate her, and Peilan is arrested and imprisoned. Because the circumstances are understandable, she is sentenced to three months in prison. When she is released from prison, all the workers come to welcome her, but Daqing has no face to see her.</p>
<h3>CAVALCADE (7) FILM NOVEL</h3>
<p>— Ne</p>
<p>Edward held her in his arms, comforting her, telling her he would never leave her. But she still kept nagging, always thinking that this perfect dream would not last forever. Edward became a little anxious, and said, "Darling, at least you can look at Father and Mother, aren't they always in love and never separated?" Edith said, "The times they lived in are different from the times we live in. The times we live in change too quickly. Life is so insecure!" Edward looked at Edith's face and asked with a smile, "Then, how long do you give us to live? One shot?" "I don't know," she suddenly said to him. "I don't care! This is our beautiful, perfect moment! I'm not afraid at all, this is ours, forever ours!" Strangely enough, these words were their last farewell as newlyweds, because at that moment, the historically famous Titanic ship was hit by an iceberg and sank, and more than a thousand people died at the same time. After Edith finished speaking, the ship was shaken by the iceberg, as if the sky was falling and the earth was splitting, and she fell into Edward's arms. For a moment, the ship was filled with the clamor of people, and the two of them no longer had time to talk about anything, nor did they have the time to think about doing anything, only knowing to hug each other tightly, listening quietly to the ship's band playing the mournful tune of "Nearer, My God, to Thee." In a moment, darkness enveloped them, they began with love and ended with love, but they hadn't tasted the sweetness of love for long!</p>
<p>When the news of the Titanic's sinking reached London, Kean and Margaret were so grieved that they couldn't say a word, and hugged each other tightly. Recalling when Edward, Edith, and other children were childhood sweethearts, it seemed like only yesterday, but now only Joey exists. As parents, their hearts can be said to be extremely heartbroken. After some time, they were able to smile again, drink tea together again, and mention Edward and Edith's names again without tearing up. But God does not estimate people, and even this small amount of peaceful years cannot be extended for a little while. At this time, Europe was in a state of emergency, and there were rumors in England that they would declare war on Germany and Austria. At that time, Robert Kean and others were traveling in Germany and received unreliable news, and hurriedly left the country in a state of embarrassment. By the time they arrived at their home in London, the British government had already declared war on Germany and Austria.</p>
<p>Joey recalled a few days ago, when he was still traveling everywhere in Germany and made many friends. He heard that Britain and Germany had declared war, and the warriors of the two countries would soon be killing each other on the battlefield. He asked his father, "I like Germans very much, what do you think?"</p>
<p>"Of course," Robert said, "I also like them very much." But they no longer discussed the issue of the war between the two countries. (To be continued)</p>
