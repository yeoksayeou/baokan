<p>— 英</p>
<p>民國肇造。廿有餘年。内戰之興。何日蔑有。迨乎九一八之　。東北淪陷。外患方興。内憂尤急。今則閩變又起。中央軍方與閩軍相峙於浙閩之交。西南復與中央依違於離合之際。川贛内地無論矣。其他各省如湘鄂豫皖。雖無巨大之騷動。而土匪徧地。農村衰敗。亦難得一片清凈地。此内憂也。至邊疆警訊。則尤呈日逼處此之勢。以言乎西藏。則達賴死後。内部變化。殊難逆料。以言乎新疆。則又有盛馬系統之爭執。以言乎東北。則熱河旣失。察東益危。華北前途。至堪憂慮。而沿江海地帶。早已形成各國共同支配勢力之範圍。尤易受牽連之影響。此外患也。當此内憂外患交相煎逼之時。國人所最不宜忽視者。除閩事外。尤在乎察哈爾與西藏之兩邊警。試析言之。</p>
<p>據本報二十一日北平電訊。察東形勢仍緊。察宋有親往察東視察訊。聞日僞此次西侵。假名勦匪。實則待機而動。别有用心。或又謂日僞此舉。一爲因通車談判停頓而示威。一爲恐張學良重來東北而示威。總之不論其藉口爲何。而必欲北踞沽源。南侵赤城。實爲其有計劃有組織之行動。而非出於旦夕之偶然可知。蓋日本自九一八以來。其整個方針。欲以紆絗方法。完成其夢想中之大陸政策。日蘇關係。旣已緩和無望。則熱河西向之陣地。自必謀趕早完成。而今日適當我中國方有事於西南閩浙之時。則更足以促發其積極西侵之夙志。若曰爲勦匪。則在如此嚴冬之際。安有鉅大之匪亂。即果有之。亦何煩越爼代謀。此其爲趁火行刦。無容掩諱者也。</p>
<p>藏事之有英國背景。世所共知。日昨滬報載京電稱。「達賴逝世後。聞其政權雖交司倫葛厦代理。但藏中原有親華親英兩派。親華派以哲邦色拉甘丹三大寺爲中心。親英者以馬基爲中心。歷年康藏糾紛。均爲此派所主動。現達賴旣死。藏中無主。衝突愈烈。一旦果爲外人利用。前途有不堪收拾之患。現中央當局甚注意之。」所傳如是。大抵當係實情。夫英國年來之所以積極向西藏從事政治經濟雙方並行之活動者。無非爲擴張領土。發展市場。鞏固印度統治種種計劃之表現。堪稱與日本之大陸政策相共鳴者也。</p>
<p>以我國今日之力量。欲撻伐之旣爲不易。而地方又値多事。生産衰落。百業停頓。處理更難著手。外侮之至。雖曰由於帝國主義之侵略尸其咎。然而實亦由於内亂不息所促成。蓋内亂與外患二者之間。互爲因果。我政府與國民。將何術以突破此日臻極度之危局耶。？</p>

<p>財政部長孔祥熙、昨日下午三時十五分、由滬乘車赴杭、商洽要公、今明日即返滬、昨晨九時、全國經濟會棉統會主席委員陳光甫·曾往謁孔氏、報告工作進行情形、十時孔接見各報社記者、茲分誌其談話於次、</p>

<p>孔氏　對於本埠麵粉廠商請求免徴已購洋麥稅案、表示拒絕、且伸述理由云、全國各地商民爲救濟農村衰落、紛紛請求中央開徴洋米麥稅、立法院亦因糧食與民生有深切之關係、爲救濟農民經濟起見、已於十一月十七日通過徴收洋米麥稅率、並於十二月十六日開始實行、中間已相距一月、則本埠麵粉商人、早已知悉財部即將開徴是項稅收、今該商乃藉口在財部未正式公佈洋米麥進口稅之前、要求免稅已購之美麥七萬五千噸、理由實不充足、决不能照准、至謂本人於昨晨十時在中央銀行召集麥粉商商洽洋麥免稅問題云云、殊非事實、蓋此或麵粉商人擬向本人請求、並非本人召集也、孔氏又謂、目下財部所徴收之洋米麥稅率、僅及立法院所通過最高稅率之半弱對於商艱及民食、均能兼顯云云、</p>

<p>兩律師之法理談</p>
<p>新聲社云、已入華籍韓人金晳、於本年十一日二十二日、被日領事署恊同法中央捕房、無端逮捕後、迭經家屬代表陳陽等、提示國籍許可證、向日法領事署請求釋放、未有效果、上海市政府復正式提起抗議、乃日領事署始則遲遲未復、延誤時日、近雖據答復、然竟謂日本政府未承認金晳已入華籍、其措詞不特矛盾、且核與現代國際法理有背、承辦本案之律師樓允梅·徐傑·爲辯正其謬說、家屬定明日再向市府及法租界當局請願、茲分誌如下、</p>
<h3 id="c175">日領先已承認 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>樓律師謂、查金晳之已於民國十八年歸化中國、不特經有中國政府之許可證、即日本政府亦早已默認、蓋金晳父子、曾於去年十二月遭駐滬日領事署之同樣逮捕嗣後得獲釋放者、亦以金晳父子歸化中國、引起中國政府之注意、嚴與交涉、恢復自由、使非日領事於去年已承認金晳歸化中國、試問援何理由、而允釋放、如果日領事署自始不承認金晳轉入華籍、何以不於去年對中國政府之交涉、提起國籍之杭爭、乃邇至今年、纔發此謬論、殊不値一駁、日本號稱文明國家、殊不應有此矛盾舉措、故就事實論、金晳之國籍問題、可謂絕無爭執矣、更就法理言、日本之國籍法規、亦幷非不承認韓人出籍、且以人民爲國家私産、不許其脫離本國國籍之主張、除少數未開化國家外、亦早經廢止矣、故一九三○年、海牙國際法編纂會議時、關於因取得外國國籍而喪失本國國籍問題、因各國意見不同、曾有下列原則之决議、「凡以歸化取得外國籍者當喪失其原有國籍、」今金晳歸化中國始於民國十八年、且在中國上海居住、業已五六年卽有國籍上之疑問、依照國際法理、亦應受所在國之法律制裁、斷不能擅行遠捕、</p>
<h3 id="c176">法捕房應負責 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>上海法租界雖因司法恊定關係、由中央巡捕房取得警權、然法巡捕房不於事前調查事實之所在、殊嫌草率、故妨害中國主權之主體、雖爲日領事署、而法領事督肇法巡捕屠亦難辭其責、責關於上海法租界内設置中國法院之恊定第七條、明明訂定、任何人犯、非先經該管法院庭訉、不得移送租界外之官廳云云、今法巡捕房恊助日領事署逮捕金晳、不按照上開條文辦理、顯屬違反恊定、該項恊定、爲法國駐華公使·及中華民國外交部長、代表各該國恊訂、中法兩國、均應遵守、今法領事竟未顧及、殊足爲中法兩國國交上之遺憾、將來二次恊定期滿時、我國政府應加以注意、緣此次金晳被捕案、卽法領事事前未有接洽、法捕房不知其已歸化中國、（見前載法領事及法巡捕房對徐律師之談話）致誤加恊助、衡諸恊定、已應負責、而經家屬提示國籍許可證書後、則誤會應已明白、卽當負責索回、乃仍一味敷衍、吾人縱不能謂爲故意、然殊嫌其近乎推諉、故此事直接雖僅爲金晳之個人法益問題、而主要重心、實爲我國之主權法權問題、單由家屬及少數團體呼籲究屬人微言輕、尙望中央當局起而力爭也、</p>
<h3 id="c177">並無兩重國籍 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>據徐律師語新聲社記者、金晳已經法定手續歸化中國、中國政府、依國籍法亦賦與以中國國籍、日本總領事復市府、謂日本法律不承認金晳爲中國籍、但中國法律始終確認金晳祇有中國國籍、斷不承認其存日本或中國以外任何國國籍之存在、記者詢其一人有兩重國籍之解决辦法、徐律師答稱、國際私法上、所謂一人有兩重國籍、並不謂在一國法律旣承認其有本國國籍、又承認其有外國國籍、不過謂比較兩國之國籍法、一人有兩個國籍之有在而已、金晳旣有中國國籍、無論有其他國家承認其有其他國籍、依照我國注律適用條例第二條但書、……但依國籍法、應認爲中國人者、依中國之法律之規定、金晳縱有犯罪嫌疑、亦應受中國法律之裁判、此種解决辦法、非但爲國際私法學者所主張、亦爲解决兩重國籍衝突之原則、至於日本法律、仍認金晳有日本國籍者、無非因該國國籍法第二十四條之規定一十七歲以上之男子、縱使有喪失國籍之原因、如未免除服兵役之義務、仍不能許其喪失日本國籍一、但查一九三○年海牙國際法典編纂會議曾有關於兩重國籍兵役之議室書、其第一條云、「兩以上國籍之人、若其習慣住所係在隷屬國家之一之領土内、而事實上又與該國最有關保時、得免除其他隷屬國家之兵役、且因此免除得爲喪失他國國籍之原因」、金晳設定住所於中國領土内、已有年所、而事實上當然與中國　有關係、依據海牙謠定書原理、金晳當然已免除日本兵役義務、並喪失日本國籍應受中國法律之制裁、</p>

<p>朋友：你們在學校裏「讀書」，是不是覺得「唱歌」！（或你們所懂的功課）！是很有趣的，而感到「算術」！（或你們不懂的功課）！是無味的嗎？這理由是很明顯的，是「懂」和「不懂」的緣故，因爲「唱歌」的拍子明瞭，所以唱起來是覺得有趣；「算術」的眞理不懂，所以做起來是無味。如果你們的確是這種情形，那末我現在有一種方法，可以使「算術」！（或你們不懂的功課）！和「唱歌」！（或你們所懂的功課）！一樣的有趣。就是在先生講的時候，剖解眞理的時候，你得「專心聽好」，如果有不明瞭的地方，你可以提出來「詢問」，到你「明瞭」爲止。不要因爲無味就把它荒廢。要曉得英人瓦特自己會研究「汽」的功用，發明「汽機」；何况我們現在有先生指導的「功課」會不能明瞭眞理，而發生無味呢？</p>

<p>斯巴達是一個尙武精神的國家。人民很健壯。因爲有個聰明的王族，名呌李扣耳古司，他訂不少條律，訓練人民。</p>
<p>當一個嬰孩初生時，他父親就得用袍子裹着他送到議會裏，由許多年老而智慧的人檢察，假如體質强健，肢體也没有裏殘，就交還那父親，帶回撫養；否則，就抛棄在山中。</p>
<p>孩子到七歲，便離開父母，由國家選擇些人看顧他們了。他們讀的書都是英雄和戰爭的故事。一年四季，從早到晚，祗准穿一件粗羊毛的衣裳。睡覺没有牀，是一堆蘆草，冬天纔祇准加墊一層柔荑草呢。</p>

<p>有個農夫他耕着一大塊田，那些稻，因爲没有雨水滋潤，快要乾枯了。農夫憂愁得很，天天望着天空，可有下雨的樣子？</p>
<p>這時候，天上有一點雨，看見他說道：「啊！可憐的農夫，你用了許多力，田稻快要乾了，我要去帮助你一點雨。」另有一點雨說：「看你這點小雨怎樣去滋潤那樣大的田？」第一點雨說：「是的，不過我下去至少可以安慰他一下」。第二點雨看見第一點雨落下去，剛巧落在農夫的頭上。他也立刻下去了，說：「讓我也來滋潤一下他的稻吧。</p>
<p>這時一大隊的雨，多跑來說道：「你們做着這樣的好事，我們也要來幹一下。」</p>
<p>一場雨過，田稻成熟。都是爲了一小小點的雨，要盡他能力做去的原故。</p>

<p>太陽已落山，寳妹妹站在家門口，等候着姐姐放工回來。對面的幾顆大樹，要把它們斫去，它們把前面的路遮掩了，使她不能早見着她的姐姐。</p>
<p>姐姐從樹林裏攢出來，寳妹妹連忙跑上前去。呌一聲姐姐，把姐姐的飯籃兒拿在自己的手裏。揭開籃蓋，看看有没有剩下的飯和菜。</p>
<p>告訴姐姐：娘的毛病還没有好，爸爸到徐先生家去借米了。姐姐不做聲，只是嘆息一聲。</p>
<p>姐姐的臉孔瘦得多了。對姐說：姐姐呀，我的氣力已大，半桶河水，我會提了跑回來。明天你可休息在家，我去代你上工罷。姐姐不做聲，只是苦笑一陣</p>

<p>手道：「幫忙是可以的，不過我們要你答應一個條件！」</p>
<p>「甚麽條件？」</p>
<p>「請你吩咐嘴吧：以後不要嘆氣！」</p>
<p>大腦道：「這是甚麽緣故？」</p>
<p>兩手說道：「因爲我倆最怕嘆氣；嘴吧歎一聲氣，我們什麽都不會幹！以後祗要你吩咐嘴吧：把牙咬緊，把氣悶住，那末憑你有天大的困難事情，我們十個弟兄（指頭）都有方法對付了！」</p>
<p>▲合作</p>
<p>嘴吧對手說：「你和我，實在應該合作！」</p>

<p>嘴吧道：「因爲我一切都能和你聯絡，譬如：你會殺人，我就會喫人；你會打人，我就會駡人！」</p>
<p>手道：「但是我會養活人！」</p>

<p>眼說；「據我看來：一二三四五六七八九○這十個數目字最偉大；人類社會的命運，都由着這十個數目字支配！」</p>
<p>口在旁邊聽到了，向耳和眼問道：「請你們兩位評判：我應當說甚麽話才算最偉大呢？」</p>
<p>「依我們想來：你不開口是最偉大；因爲無論甚麽事，經你一說，偉大就變成渺小！」耳和眼同聲回答說。</p>

<p>— 乃常</p>
<p>耶莎是一個强健的，有着血紅色的鬃髮的孩子；但牠終日什麽事都不想做，只想着玩，想着欺騙人家。一天下午，它裝着跛子，向人家討飯了。</p>
<p>「可憐一條跛了腿的驢子吧！給幾個銅子我吧！」</p>
<p>剛巧一個呌做黑利的孩子，從他跟前走過，見它命運這樣凄凉，便給了它點錢。</p>
<p>隔了許多天，在另外一個地方，耶莎，又裝做盲了眼的。黑利又從這兒經過，見得這就是以前那跛了脚的，一下子它明白了。便裝做憐憫的樣子，答應了帶耶莎到家裏去好好的欵待它。到了家裏，黑利把它帶進大木欄里，關了門，然後對耶莎說了：</p>
<p>「朋友，張開你的眼睛，看看這是什麽地方吧？怎麽你要欺騙人家呢？」</p>
<p>受了監禁之後的耶莎，再不敢欺騙人家了。</p>
<h3 id="c254">一個銅板 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 石愚生</p>
<p>照例媽媽又給了我十個銅板的早點心錢。可是今天走到飽子店門口，我躊躇了。</p>
<p>導師不是說過嗎？這樣的狀况之下，中國的孩子，要刻苦自勵，不該圖口頭的快樂啊！不看見那東北的小同胞嗎？可憐！他們是中國人，連中國的書，也没得讀呢！他們再不能跟他們爸爸媽媽讀祖國的文字，一定要學那倭語了！我能圖口頭美味，不營救我的小同胞嗎？丨丨不，我每天至少要節省一個銅板，作航空救國的儲金呀！</p>
<p>「三個銅板一個」！賣燒餅的尖銳的呌喊。我毫不遲疑的掏出了九個銅板。</p>
<p>那飽子店的老夥計，驚奇的乜著我；他却那曉得我嚼乾燒餅的滋味呢！</p>

<p>— 矜細</p>
<p>有一粒麥子，躱在倉内歎氣。</p>
<p>它猜想到幾天以後，那可怕的農夫要把它們活埋到泥土的下層去。它不願有如此慘酷的遭遇，所以它憂慮着，歎氣。</p>
<p>可怕的日子終于來到了，但是這位麥子很乖覺，居然逃避出了農夫的注意，它仍舊可以安穩地躱在倉内。</p>
<p>它是快活的，但也是悲哀的。悲哀的全體的同伴出倉，在長期間要没有朋友和它談天。</p>
<p>第二年春天，有大批新麥子進倉。那是去年同伴們的兒子。</p>
<p>于是這粒麥子懊悔了。牠說：「一粒麥子不埋泥裏去，仍然是一粒且將腐敗了：若是不怕埋，就結出許多粒來。」</p>
<h3 id="c256">弟弟那裏來的呢？ <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>

<p>「爹爹賺元寳，姆媽添弟弟，……」惠民獨自坐在門檻上唱着；但一轉念，他忽然想到姆媽添弟弟，弟弟究從那裏來的呢？他忙跑到母親那裏。</p>
<p>「姆媽！你又要給我添個弟弟了，這弟弟究屬那裏來的呢？」</p>
<p>「孩子」！母親說着笑了：「你要明白，這個你慢慢長大了便能懂的；你要看，現在我家那只狸貓，快要生小貓了，你等着瞧吧」。</p>
<p>惠民聽了這個答覆，只是腹狐疑，每天到貓窩邊去望望狸貓，狸貓不會解釋什麽，只是向着惠民「咪嗚丨咪嗚」的呌着。</p>

<p>今天天氣很冷，但學校中仍舊是要上體操，因爲劉老師曾這樣講過：「要好的體格和精神，必定要在這種冷天煆練，」三年級的學生王斯達，很法重這句話，所以他的身體很張壯。</p>
<p>有一天早晨，王斯達在操場上看見體操老師一個人在那裏打拳，心裏忽然想：「怪不得校長很歡喜，很稱讚體操老師的，這是因爲他自己背努力的幹，結果所以如此好呀！」</p>
<p>一個肯努力的幹的兒童，將來一定能得好的幸福。</p>

<p>▲替代脚用的尾巴</p>
<p>袋鼠的尾巴，大而有力。當兩隻後脚竪立的時候，那尾巴必貼靠在地上以支持他的身體，有時候用尾巴支持全身，再用後脚蹴敵。</p>
<p>▲防寒用的尾巴</p>
<p>栗鼠的尾巴，在樹枝上跑來跑去，旣可平衡它的身體的傾斜，又能保護身體的溫度。</p>
<p>▲表示危險的尾巴</p>
<p>鹿在山中，遇見異類猛獸時，它的尾巴，立刻豎起，而在尾巴下面生白毛的部分，表現得愈加顯著。大凡遇敵的時候，這白毛部分，特别震動，就是報告同類預防「敵來了，趕緊留心吧！」的意義。</p>

<h3 id="c259">農村小友的通問 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>▲介紹</p>
<p>我的小朋友們：</p>
<p>許多小朋友，雖然是新交，但也神交已久。不過，經最近的通問，似乎更親近了。對於我的認識，似乎也需要了。不得不來申述幾句：</p>
<p>前次信上，我自稱「鄕老」。諸位小朋友，一定這樣懷疑着：「他是位鄕下老頭兒吧！」「鄕下土老兒吧！」……在「老」字上推敲。朋友，我的小朋友，我這「鄕老」的稱謂，决毫無這個意味。起初，我用這兩字，是因爲我久常在生活在鄕村裏，和這大自然終年相伴：的確和鄕村處得很有感情，我懷念它，它眷戀着我，以致我和它形影不能相離。丨丨因爲，我的你們的時代，摟的在它的懷裏：跳着，舞着。現在的你們的時代，又在它的膝前交接你們丨丨小朋友的朋友。天天唱着快樂之歌，大家樂融融，找着未來的光明大道去走。現在正奏着進行曲！</p>
<p>小朋友啊：認識了我吧？「鄕老」的意義知道了吧？請用你們智慧的腦袋去會意罷！</p>
<p>再會！</p>
<p>▲殘秋</p>
<p>小朋友：</p>
<p>眞奇怪啊！那烈女也似的秋風，居然這幾天，擺起兇狠的面孔，「狂嘯大吼」丨不知誰觸怒它？比在可親可愛的替人類驅着「暑氣薰蒸」的世界，帶來溫和的「秋」的時候，眞是「判若兩人」了。</p>
<p>噢！那蒼老的皮色，頗有「行將就木」之勢。它知道未期快要到了，作最後的狂呼：恐怕惡毒的世界快要降臨，不忍人類受其踐踏吧！然而它「聲嘶力竭」，終於克服那「張牙舞爪」，「猙獰面目」的兇神之下！</p>
<p>許多許多的樹木，大家都換了衣服，披蔴帶孝，大地一片白，靜悄悄地表示着這位烈女「壽終正寢」了。</p>
<p>小朋友！是不是肅殺的空氣，籠罩着來了？丨我們人類許許多多寳貴青春，就這樣被剥削去了的。你們迎頭趕上去吧！莫嗟跎！莫蹉跎！</p>
<p>再會！</p>
<h3 id="c260">笑話四則 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 敬安</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>敏兒對亞萬說：「你鎖好自己房門出外的時候，爲什麽不對你家裏的人，說明一聲，要我東尋西覓找你呢？」亞萬說、「我早寫明紙上，放在我自己房裏桌子上，難道你没看見嗎？」</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>母親從外面回來，兒子看不清楚是誰，高聲問道。「你來做什麽？」母親含怒道：「你識我麽？」兒子道：「哦！原來是母親，那麽，你難道不曉得我是近視眼麽？」</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>我夜裏睡眠定要把燈光熄去，前晚十二點鐘松兒醒來，黑漆漆不見一物，就大哭起來，我們給他鬧醒了，連忙問他哭什麽，他說：「爹爹呀！我的眼睛瞎了！」</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>亞振買了鵝，適要大便，只好把鵝放在地上跑進公厠去，不料被人用鴨換掉。亞振出來一看，說道：「很奇怪啊丨一時不見，怎麽就餓得這般瘦小呢？」</p>

<p>愛國土，勿使破；</p>
<p>愛國貨，能致富，</p>
<p>地大物博生産多，</p>

<p>戴紅冠，好壯麗，</p>
<p>不貪懶惰能早起；</p>
<p>喚醒多少夢中人，</p>
<p>大家認眞做事體。</p>

<p>▲籌設高級職校</p>
<p>南京市政府因敎部希望各省市敎育經費、已於日前由市府當局與敎部督學、會商京市敎育獨立辦法、據聞已商定敎費獨立之原則、由市府令市社會局擬具詳細計劃、大致有將房捐與中央補助費及市府其他欵項指定幾種、組織保管委員會、負監督之責、　敎費另儲、爲澈底之獨立云、</p>
<p>又聞市府在最近之將來、决計將初級職業學校整理擴充、於高級職業學校之設立、因開辦費預計約四十萬元、擬一面向庚欵委會請求補助、一面由市府自籌、此種高級職校亦在計劃中、但比初級職校之擴充、爲時稍緩耳、</p>

<p>敎部專員李熙謀、視察安徽江西兩省敎育歸來、對於視察兩省之詳細報告、正在編製中、茲就私人談話、將兩省政費情形及普遍應加注意之點、記述於下、</p>
<p>▲敎育經費情形　（一）安徽省敎育經費、年支二百六十餘萬元、其中有一百二十萬元爲中央補助費、餘　百四十餘萬元由省庫支給、中央補助費按月照領、省支經費、比較欠些、該省敎費獨立、有敎育經費管理處之設立、負經費收支之貴、（二）江西省敎育經費、每年二百萬元、係鹽附稅、其經費係由財部所設之西岸榷運局照撥、該省敎費獨立設有保管委員會、監督敎費用途、有管理處負收支敎費之貴、但以上兩省敎費獨立、尙不如江蘇敎費管理處之直接徴收敎費耳、</p>
<p>應行注意之點　據聞兩省普遍相同應行注意之事、（一）爲普通科學之敎學方法、敎師僅以書本敎學、敎室内缺乏實騐之科學儀器、以致敎理化等科、因少器物加以證明實騐、學生减少興趣、（二）對於社會敎育、（民衆敎育成人敎育）缺少相當之辦理主持人員、此種情形、多因在舉辦之前、無相當訓練人才之準備、（三）職業敎育對於設備與師資非常缺乏、而對於本地手工業太不重視、以致出品較差、不能與外貨競爭、希望以後各地中小學敎師、要於暑期有補習機會、以補充學識和技能、</p>

<p>事前各個心理、戰後結果表示、中華顯然居高臨下、操縱全局、但當時實際戰况、亦未盡然、上半時葡軍驚奇之表演、未嘗不爲中華担憂開始十五分鐘内、Ｒ法凡却尙未駕臨、局勢不均、中華攻多於守、迨後葡軍氣燄猝盛、戰至二十五分鐘時、中華首先被陷又五分鐘、葡軍亦遭奇禍、一和一之後形勢嚴重、觸目驚心、稍一不愼、變化隨起、而葡軍銳利尤過人、最後孫錦順亂中射入一球、造成上半時二對一佔先之局面、上半時葡軍人馬困乏、疲於應付、中華大舉進攻、頭頂脚踢、無往不利連獲五球、似不甚實力也、</p>

<p>— 吳溪</p>
<p>有人說：「眞正有力的文藝作品，應該是上口溫醇的酒。」</p>
<p>對於這說法，我是不能同意的。</p>
<p>怎樣纔是一篇文藝作品呢？這並不在上口是否「溫醇」，或者上口是否「極猛」上來决定，而是要從作品的藝術性上來决定：我如此想。</p>
<p>譬如一篇呌做文藝作品的文字，有着「劍拔弩張」的形式，但並没有「劍拔弩張」的内容，這並不能算是「眞眞有力的文藝作品。」有了内容，有了適合於内容的形式，而没有藝術上的價値丨或者是新的名詞新的口號的集合體，或者只是槪念的描寫，這也不能算作「藝術。」若果在上口與上口之後，雖都「極猛」，而確實是藝術的，我們能把它屛出於藝術圈外，用「上口不溫醇」的條件，否定它作爲「文藝作品」而存在嗎？</p>
<p>相反的，「上口溫醇」了，這也並不能斷定它就是一篇「眞眞有力的文藝作品」，而且「過後發作起來」，一定「醉得死人」。還得看看這「上口溫醇的酒」的藝術上的價値。「題材只是平易的故事」，這當然没有什麽問題。不過，題材就是不平易，但那是眞實的：或者是偶然性的材料，而這偶然中表現了必然：難不成這樣的題材就不能攝取嗎？而且，即使是「上口醇」而後又「醉人」了，這「醉人」是由於酒味的芳馨，還是由於酒内包含的毒素在發酵，在這上面，我們的文藝論者，也不能不加以注意吧？不過，這是本題以外的話。</p>
<p>所以我說，「眞眞有力的文藝作品」，應該從作品的藝術性上去看；把考察的重心放在上口「溫醇」與不「溫醇」上，不僅會使人「迷惘」而且會使人重復踏回舊的「歧路。」</p>
<p>「但並不是說上口極猛的文藝作品就要不得。不過作家應該不以上口猛爲滿足。」話說得雖然圓通，實際上是否定了前者的存在。</p>

<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>梁啟超，胡適之先生們大開研究國學者必讀的書目的時候，我還只有十四五歲，不知怎的，那時本來很有研究國學之志，但一看到那些書目，反而被嚇倒，從此就對國學這東西斷了念。只在那些書目中選了幾部詩文集雜亂無章地讀了一下，想在文章上得點益，至於宋明理學以及别的關於道德的修養的書，可一本也没有讀。</p>
<p>現在看來，不獨我是這樣。一般青年在修養方面，幾乎全是側重於文章而忽略了道德。故而人心不古，青年們日趨於浮薄，尤其是做做文章的青年，大部分常欠厚道。最近有人對青年提出了道德的修養，還推薦了作爲修養的基礎的好書，我以爲是很有意思的事情。這比同時提出的怎樣作文學的修養的問題，實在重要得多。至少是我自己，很覺得有讀這些好書的必要。不過「論語」「孟子」是曾經不當做道德書而翻過的，只有「顔氏家訓」，則因「家訓」兩字一向使我望而却步，故不曾拜讀，現在要讀，反要從這一部入手。</p>
<p>讀了之後，在道德方面固然得益很多，丨不過還要等我能夠遵訓實行丨但同時發現了一種矛盾，使我彷徨起來。原來，我是一個還想做做文章的人，我之所以想兼修道德，乃是要二者並行，又「蓄道德，」又「能文章。」然而據顔氏所舉的例，則「自古文人，多陷輕薄」。文章與道德之間，常常存在着一種矛盾。他說：「屈原露才揚已，顯君暴過；宋玉體貌容冶，見過俳優；東方曼倩滑稽不雅；司馬長卿竊貲無操；王褒過章僮約；楊雄德敗美新；李陵降辱夷虜；劉歆反覆莽世：傅毅黨附權門；班固盜竊父史；趙元叔抗疎過度；馮敬通浮華檳壓；馬季長佞媚獲誚；蔡伯喈同惡受誅；吳質詆訶鄕里；曹値悖慢犯法；杜篤乞假無厭；路粹隘狹已甚；陳琳實號麤疏；繁欽性無檢格；劉楨屈强輸作；王粲卒躁見嫌；孔融　衡誕傲致殞；楊修丁廙扇動取斃；阮籍無禮敗俗；稽康凌物兇終；傅玄忿鬥免官；孫楚矜誇凌上；陸機犯順履險；潘岳乾談取危；顔延年負氣拙黜；謝靈運空疎亂紀；王元長兇賊自貽；謝玄暉侮慢見及……」連子游，子夏。荀况，孟軻……之儔，也被顔氏謂爲「損敗居多」。</p>
<p>看以上所舉的人名，多半是「文選」中的重要作者，倘把他們的作品抽掉，文選就失了推薦給文學青年的價値。然而、從道德的見地看來，他們是無取的，連作「孟子」的孟軻，也爲道德家所不取，然則，不獨文學與道德相矛盾，道德與道德不是也有了矛盾之點麽？</p>
<p>孔子一定是最有道德的了，但他没有文章。顔氏自己也有文學作品，但編入「文選」中並不見得怎樣出色。求其「蓄道德能文章」的兼美人物，其惟歌陽文忠公乎？然而「江南柳」一詞，也蒙了「盜甥」的嫌疑，至於被錢穆父所醜詆。這眞呌我們有志修養的青年何去何從？</p>
<p>顔氏解釋文人易於損敗之故，道：「文章之體，標舉興會，發引性靈，使人矜伐，故忽於持操，果於進取，今世文士，此患彌切，…加以砂礫所傷，慘於矛戟，諷刺之禍，速乎風慶一，這實在是很對的。在這一點，實應謹守顔氏之訓：「深宜防慮，以保元吉。」（以上原文，均見「論文章」篇）</p>
<p>不但道德與文章，道德與道德都有矛盾而已，文章與文章之間，也有矛盾。如「勉學」篇云：</p>
<p>「有一權貴，讀誤本蜀都賦，注解：蹲鴟芋也。乃爲羊字。人饋羊肉，答書云：捐惠蹲鴟，舉朝驚駭，不解事義，久後尋迹，方知如此。」</p>
<p>這個美話，實係文學的修養太深所致。倘在常人，直白地說「捐惠羊肉」，雖然見得語彙貧乏，可是决不至鬧得「舉朝驚駭，不解事義」。導師們或者要說道：「那是讀了誤本蜀都賦之故呀！」然而誰能担保，文選没有誤本呢？</p>
<h3 id="c307">船埠 <a href="#c307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— 徐轉蓬</p>
<p>不反風，上水的碼頭船到的時候是有一定的。每天，正當全市的燈火亮了，碼頭船也便吹着海螺靠岸了。</p>
<p>今天從早晨到黄昏，下着雨，又刮着很猛的北風，天氣陰沉沉的而且冷得要命，雪像就要飄下來一樣。到了二更時份，船還没有到來。</p>
<p>碼頭脚夫，旅店招待，都躱在小酒店和小茶棚里，等待着船上的來客。各人被寒冷威逼着，吐出霧一般的氣，牙齒也戰慄了，他們想喝一口燙的酒，熱的茶，增加一些體溫。他們不時地走近靠江的窗口，探望黑𪐶𪐶的江面。有一粒火花，忽紅，忽黑。漸漸的向前移動，又好似漸漸的向後退遠去……沙灘上隱約的聽得有人喊。</p>
<p>「那是船夫們呵丨」</p>
<p>有人問：「見了船没有？」</p>
<p>回答說：「見了船上的燈火。」</p>
<p>於是有人用着似乎快樂的聲音說：「那麽，船不久便到了。」</p>
<p>另一班更窮困的没有資格走進酒店茶棚去避風的脚夫們，聚集在風吹不到的牆角，撥一堆垃圾燒起火來，各人閃着夢幻一般的眼睛。</p>
<p>城里打過三更了，他們再向江面望去，船上的燈火好像仍停在原來的地方。但沙灘上船夫們燒起的火把，却很亮的可以看到了。</p>
<p>「船快到了。」有人又說。</p>
<p>「看去很近，但至少　該走一點鐘，這樣大的風，船也給吹回去了……」</p>
<p>小城完全睡着了。船上的螺却在這死寂的深夜嘟嘟的吹響了。船終於靠岸了。</p>
<p>沿船埠的各家酒店，小食店，轉亮了油燈，等待着從船上下來的「飢餓」的顧客。</p>
<p>旅店招待，脚夫，睜大朦朧的閃着夢幻的眼睛，趕出來蝟集在船埠。</p>
<p>但從船艙内吐出來的，是一批「蹩脚」的人們，他們除了一隻小包裹外，没有别的行李。這是用不着脚夫也不値得旅店招待「迎接」的人們！有錢的上等旅客，在這種不好的壞天氣，誰願出門呢？脚夫旅店的招待，帶着失望的心情，悄悄的走散了。</p>
<p>船夫們上岸來了，闖進了酒店，他們的面孔被風吹腫了，現得椶褐色的。水淋淋的，濕的脚影零亂的印在地板上，他們的脚完全被水浸得發白了。</p>
<p>酒店老板娘，慣愛說好話的：</p>
<p>「可憐，這般的冷天，還要赤着脚在水里……」</p>
<p>船夫們得到了安慰似的：「世界上只有你可憐我們呵，老板娘，快打一斤酒，要滾燙的……」</p>
<p>喝着，喝着，喝完了喊再要，直到後半夜，酒店老板娘伏在櫃臺上打瞌睡了。船夫們醉醺醺的溜了出去。</p>
<p>「老板娘，掛我的賬，没有帶現錢來啦！」</p>
<p>她免强的吐出個「哦」字。她好像猜中了船夫們没有現錢似的。她關了店門，想想明天也不高興再開店門了，她感覺到開小酒店也不是出路……</p>

<p>烈文兄：</p>
<p>今天看見企影先生的一篇「夏里賓與高爾基」，他所記得夏里賓的故事，的確是我所没有知道的。我曾看了一九二七年出版的他的自傳，那本書裏他並没有記着他不願回祖國去的事情，而他的「溜出」了他的祖國，據他自己說是因爲在祖國居留得太久了，恐怕歐洲藝術界忘記了他。所以因了盧那却爾斯基的帮忙，搭乘李列維支的專車，離去了他的祖國。没有他在企影先生所說的「假面與人」那本書中的紀述，我們的確很容易受他的欺騙。現在，就企影先生的這篇文字看來，大槪這位夏里賓先生對於革命後的他的祖國的確有點「滑頭」態度。祖國没有棄絕他，而他却先棄絕了祖國，這是不足取的。</p>
<p>我不願意爲了推崇藝術之故而曲解一個貴族的供奉者爲藝術的自由人，故請將此信刊出於自由談，以示讀者，幷示企影先生。　施蟄存</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑李維克著譯</p>
<p>他被一種突然襲來的恐怖所鼓組，這種恐怖來得這樣迅速且有權威，竟使他像是門都没有開便衝進了他的臥房似的。</p>
<p>房間裏像是空着。祇有一枝燭放在衣櫉上照亮着房間。</p>
<p>哲安向窗戶跑去，窗戶是關着的，連外面的面葉窗都關了。他回轉身，以他那驚慌的目光搜索着房内那些黑暗的角落，於是他看見床舖上的帳子已經放下了。他連忙跑去揭起來。他母親睡在他的床上，臉孔埋在枕頭底下，這枕頭是她用那痙孿着的手抓來擱在頭上，以便什麽也不再聽到的。</p>
<p>他起初以爲她窒息着了。隨後，他抓着她的肩膀，把她翻了一個身，她還没有抛棄那蓋在她的臉孔上，且被她用嘴咬着免得自己呼出聲來的枕頭。</p>
<p>可是他一經觸着這僵硬的身體，這兩隻痙孿着的手臂，他便懂得她曾受着怎樣難以形容的痛苦的打擊。看着她用手和齒那樣堅毅有力地把那塡滿着鳥毛的布袋塞着自己的口，蓋着自己的耳和目，免得他看見她和她說話，由他自己所受的打擊，他便知道人是可以痛苦到怎樣程度的。於是他的心，他那單純的心，便不勝其憐憫之感。他不是一個法官，他，連一個仁慈的法官都說不上，他祇是一個懦弱的人，一個溫柔的兒子。他一點也不記得另一個對他說的話了，他不研究，也不爭辯，他祇用她的兩手觸着他母親那一動也不動的身體，他旣不能奪下她臉上的枕頭，他便吻着她的衣裳呌道：</p>
<p>「媽媽，媽媽，我可憐的媽媽，你看看我呀！」</p>
<p>假使她的週身没有流過一道差不多看不出來的顫慄，一道緊張着的弦的振動時，她便眞像死了一様。他反覆地說道：</p>
<p>「媽媽，媽媽，聽我說啦，這事不是眞的。我知道這事不是眞的。」</p>
<p>她抽縮了一下，窒息了一下，隨後便突然在枕頭上嗚咽起來了。於是她所有的神經都弛緩過來。她那些僵硬了的筋肉也柔軟了，她那些半開着的指頭放下了枕頭；他便發現了她的驗孔。</p>
<p>她的臉孔完全是白的，從她那閉着的眼瞼裏流出了一滴一滴的眼淚。他抱着她的頸根，吻着她的眼睛，慢慢的，狂亂而用力地吻着，他的嘴唇都被她的眼淚浸濕了，他老是說：</p>
<p>「媽媽，親愛的媽媽，我知道這事不是眞的。你不用哭，我知道！這事不是眞的！」</p>
<p>她竪起了身子，坐着，凝視着他，挾着在某種情况自殺時所必需鼓起的勇氣對他說：</p>
<p>「你的話不對，這事是眞的，我的孩子。」</p>
<p>於是彼此面對面一句話都没有了。暫時之間她又窒息着，她把喉嚨伸直，把頭向後仰着以便呼吸，隨後她又克服了自己，再說道：</p>
<p>「這事是眞的，我的孩子。我爲什麽要撒謊呢？這事是眞的。如果我撒謊，你會不相信的。」</p>

<p>▲交易因假期而清淡</p>
<p>紐約二十二日來電報告一週中之棉市云、上週棉市以假期已屆、故交易有限、且多數爲近期生意、十二月期及一月期多頭大都掉進遠期、南方套賣極少、常年假前現貨佚給之增加、目前未見實現、聞係多數棉農均已接受一角押欵之故、生意雖較有起色、但以金元前途、一無把握、致受限制一九三四年之棉田減少爭議、不久、卽將開始、其結果、則將决之於一月底也、業中人均靜待商業之轉機、與夫下屆棉田情形之表現、基本貨品市况靜而堅、蓋亦希於新年中需要之重振也、</p>

<p>丨標粉又見回軟丨</p>
<p>昨日粉市、初漲繼落、終又回軟、上午因美電期麥漲一元、人心甚佳、廠有抵補、各月份均居挺站、午後市上傳借麥中有麵粉十分之四、亦將逐次裝申求售、上海粉市實銷不旺、再有大批美粉來申、市面更須下跌、因此國買各戶均無辦胃、惟各廠均不售抛、且有大廠趁小抵補、市面稍被拉住、奈實銷與客囤均無胃口、結果仍見趨小、故市一月小一分半、二月小一分二五、四五月各小一分、三月小七五、本月亦帶小二五云</p>

<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源尙湧　共到六七十號、（八九千石）其中晚稻仍祗二十餘艘、惟浦積較厚、故包胃如客帮及上棧者能將所剩之貨辦去三千餘包、但價續小角許、至於各帮厚粳、雖到貨頗湧、而店胃銷化復强、供求互平、惟對於吃盤問題、則雙方處相待之勢、結果成定中帶軟之局、杜洋尖貨乏無榮辱、陰變元去路稍滯、致又轉疲、</p>
<p>（滬北）各路到船五十五六號、市上各色銷胃仍淡、白粳客秈價形定立、薄稻早稻羊杜埠秈疲落數分、白元陰元略帶緊勢、</p>

<p>▲生油　市面亦不振作、來源不湧、故底積不多、約有一二百件、而去路還暢、但價已步削、昨市須跌八角、成交夾倉油一千五百件、價開十元零五角、泊兒油三百件、價爲十元零七角云、</p>

<p>— 義</p>
<p>在這混亂的時代中，只要是不願落伍的青年，都想努力求學，把自己的頭腦充實起來。但要達到這個目的，必先解决一個問題，就是要設法使肚子不致空虛，因爲肚子空了，餓了，便不能求學。但是，在這年頭兒，如果不是家藏萬金的人，要使肚子不致有空虛的危險，所謂解决生活問題，也不容易。即令幸而找到了一個職業，可以使肚子保持常態，不致空虛，但要想同時專心去讀書，充實頭腦，却是辦不到的。在此失業危機正向前發展的情况下，一般的工作部門都非常擁擠，一般的工作時間都在日益增加，假如你幸而謀得了一個職業，除去工作和爲了要維持飯碗的應酬所化費的時間外，你還能得到一點空閒去讀書嗎？由此可見爲了肚子便爲不了頭腦；如果要去爲頭腦，便就爲不了肚子：這兩者在目前是衝突的。</p>
<p>我們常常在新聞紙的分類廣告上看到許多青年在找求職業，其中有些要想達到半工半讀的目的，這是充分表明：他們在求生和求知的兩大欲望之下，想消滅其肚子與頭腦底衝突，想使這兩者同時都能充實起來。但事實告訴我們，這些希望半工半讀的青年多半都失敗了，結果甚至有餓飯的危險。當然，在那些希望半工半讀的青年中，也有達到目的的，但即令是完全達到目的了，在實際上也不過得到一個「半讀」而已，仍然未能滿足求知的欲望。所以求生與求知這兩大欲望，在目前情况下，是一般青年所没有辦法滿足的，肚子與頭腦底衝突在現狀下的，一般青年中是不可調和的。</p>
<p>求生當然比求知重要，一般青年在没有辦法同時充實肚子與頭腦時，便不得不努力去爲肚子而奔走了。於是人類底生存鬭爭便更加尖銳，於是在這鬭爭中所産生的許多滑稽的，可鄙的，殘酷的現象便日益增加起來。這是誰的罪過呢？這應該由誰來負責呢？我說：從存在於一般青年中的肚子與頭腦底衝突起，一直到他們抛棄頭腦專門爲肚子而奔走止，這些現象，都是由現社會制度下「窮困」這東西産生出來的。</p>

<p>學徒</p>
<p>天哪！你偏和我作對，呌頭髮一下便長得這般模樣：長長地，蓬蓬地，活像……一般，怪難看。</p>
<p>頭髮儘是長，袋子裏却長不出一個小銅子，没奈何，讓牠一輩子地去長吧！</p>
<p>伸酸了頭頸，望穿了秋水，眼巴巴地望到十五號，興怱怱地領到了工錢丨一張花花綠綠的鈔票。莫誤會，並不是一張一百元的，或是十元五元的，而是一張一元錢的。哈丨怪有趣，這東西塞在衣袋裏，胸都給牠挺直了不少。</p>
<p>頭髮長·没法兒想，祗得光臨一下理髮所。好好的一張鈔票，塞進了烟紙店櫃檯裏，却變了六隻雙毫銀角和十幾個銅子。我祇是一路上打量着，到那一爿經濟些的理髮店裏。迤邐地走到天后宮橋堍，瞥見路旁有一爿理髮店，但那門口堂皇的裝潢先就把我嚇恨了。走吧，這裏不是我的目的地。</p>
<p>走下去總是找不到，没奈何，再到那爿理髮店去瞧價目表，大槪總不至於</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>十分貴的吧！於是依着原路的回去。到了那爿理髮店門口，「×××」的金字招牌映入我的眼簾，却找不到價目表。「且瞧瞧裏面的陳設怎樣再說，」我想。</p>
<p>「喂！請進來，裏面坐。」我剛探進了半個頭，便給他們用文明的綁票手段招呼住了，祇得硬着頭皮進去，再作道理。呀！你瞧，輝煌的電光，光滑的地板，電氣吹髮，摩面，還有些呌不出的玩意兒。香氣是和厠所裏的臭氣一樣的濃郁。坐着理髮的，都是那些高突着肚皮的紳士，洋裝畢挺的少年……。司役獻殷勤，上茶，拭帽……。我眞好似劉姥姥撞進了大觀園，窘到了極點，臉熱刺刺，心也不安分起來了，祇是没規則的跳。</p>
<p>「小先生，剃什麽式的？」</p>
<p>「圓頂，馬馬虎虎吧，快一些……」我摸摸身邊的六隻雙毫銀角，心裏委實着急：「假使他要我一元多錢，這可糟糕了。倒霉的撞到這裏來，呌他馬馬虎虎大槪總可少給一些錢吧？」</p>
<p>「哈！馬馬虎虎……」他操着江北口音和别個人說，下面的話聽不清。同時猙獰的一笑，直刺入我弱小的心靈。本來不安分的心，再受了這刺激，跳得簡直有些出了常軌，呼吸似乎很難，頭腦昏昏地，臉熱刺刺地，唉！我眞受不下，我眞想逃出來。</p>
<p>我的心又怎樣地焦急，摸摸身邊的六隻八開，我眞怨恨自己，敲自己的頭腦，怎樣會撞到這裏來。我又遲疑着：給他兩角呢，還是四角，六角……？想想多給他眞有些不願意，一個月的心血，僅僅換來一元錢；少給他呢，他與我爲難又怎樣辦。好容易頭剃好了，我終於决心掏出了兩毫錢。我的手抖着，全身的血液雲時都歸到心房裏，頭也不回的一溜烟跑了。在路上我深深的呼了一口氣，摸摸袋裏的銀角，自己也不禁有些好笑起來。</p>

<p>— 金益齋</p>
<p>電氣工人</p>
<p>電氣工人在中國今日總算是待遇較高的工人了。每天祗有八小時工作，工錢中等的每月也有三十塊洋鈿，星期日且有例假，而我就是這樣的一個工人。在中國今日勞工隊伍中，可也就算是最幸運的一個了。但惟其如此，所以我的問題，也就在此等情形下發生出來了。起先，因爲生活得到保障，心中倒也快慰，又因環境的新奇，把我的精神維擊着，所以每天遇着上工下工，到包飯作吃飯，回家睡覺，星期日早上多睡一忽，白天閒玩的刻板式的機械生活，倒也不覺其苦。不意過了兩三個月，認識的朋友一多，情形就不同了。他們有家室的，我看到他們融融洩洩互相慰藉的樂趣，心中非常羨慕。二十四歲，正當青春時期的我，又在生活比較安定之時，當然逃不出「食色性也」的公例。因此就引起了我精神和身體上的另一種需要，使我常感覺煩悶。但是，對於打野雞，軋姘頭，花柳醫院窗櫉中的梅毒標本早已嚇退了我的勇氣。所以我就把我解决問題的念頭，完全集中在娶妻上面來了。心中一有了這念頭，精神馬中就有了變化。上包飯作吃飯時，心中就想到，假如有妻，就可以自己作飯，兩個人自己作飯吃，不一定比一個人向包飯作吃來得貴。回家睡覺時，就想到房裏一個人住和兩個人住不是一樣嗎？假如有妻，絕不會辛辛苦苦地作工回來，連個說話對手都没有，這樣凄凉的！况有妻尙可省洗衣縫補費用，也不見得片面的只增加負担。尤其是星期日，短命的星期日，使我在家百無聊賴，出外看到上海人人所能看見的馬路上的男女怪象，更使我心中忐忑不安。到此時眞使我無時無地不想念娶妻了。最使我受刺激下决心的，是每因在外同三朋四友游玩，回家遲了，呌二房東開門的苦處。他明明是聽見了，却假裝不聽見，起碼要我候半小時。好容易把門呌開了，他那一副不高興的嘴臉和口中嘮嘮叨叨的閒話，眞使我難受已極，隨着就聯想到，假如有妻，何致如此？</p>
<p>現在我是有妻了！而且有子了！但是其中快樂却並不如我過去所想像那樣的，相反的，我又感覺到了一種新的痛苦。我每在作工時，就想到玩弄電力是非常危險的，假如我一旦因此致死，妻被兒拌住了，作不了工，他們將如何生活？靠撫恤金嗎？有限得很，况且資本家正在設法打消。我每下工回家時，身體是疲乏極了，心中很容易起煩惱，但是妻被家庭瑣事及與人作領到家裏來的零碎工作也作疲乏了，心中也未必和順。因此爲了她作飯，要呌我抱娃，或娃僥倖睡着了，她作飯，要呌我取東放西，在此過程中，或我躱懶少作點，或我作得慢一點，她駡我一句，我說她一句，彼此就鬧起來了。在此時我心中就發出這樣的感想，下工到包飯作去吃飯多快活，家庭眞是地獄。而且暗地裏還埋怨妻道：「你累，是因爲家中多了你和孩子而來的，未必專爲着我。我現在的寃枉，眞是說不出。没有你和孩子，我經濟還勉强可以過得去。吃飯並不用我作了工尙要帮着燒。」這當然是我片面的理由。在妻那一方面，她也何嘗不是一肚皮眼淚無處流呢！這樣一想，我心中馬上就下斷語，就是說：窮人根本就不應有家室，免得活着受累，死也不閉眼。但是我又一回想：天下窮人多，富的很少，假如窮人都不要家室，若干年後，人類不將絕種嗎？因此，我就感覺到，這是現代社會上一個根本而且重大的問題。</p>

<p>衖　堂大學生</p>
<p>上海有一種特别人，即是丨丨並未住學校只是住在馬路兩旁衖堂的亭子間或前樓裏過「學生生活」的人。這種人，多半是没有職業的，本可歸於無業遊民之類。但因他們本來是學生，現在雖然住在衖堂裏，却還没有失掉「學生的架子」，所以有些凑趣的人，就稱他們爲一衖堂大學生」。</p>
<p>自然，「衖堂大學生」多半都是很「窮」的。但大槪說來，他們都很懂藝術，這可以拿他們住的房子底佈置來證明。在他們住的一間小小的亭子間或前樓裏，你可以看到一架鐵牀斜放在屋角中；一張寫字台也是斜放着的，與這鐵床正對着；在寫字台的旁邊必然是放着一個書架，很整齊地擺着些洋書；地板是</p>
<p>▲尙有重要文字轉入第五版▲</p>

<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>刷得光光的：電影明星的照片是釘在屋内的最顯明的地方：燒飯的用具必然是放在不易見到的處所，爲的是這些東西並不漂亮：如果他們還可以拿條褲子去當時，那便一定要去買一束鮮花來插在花瓶裏，微風過處，可以聞到令人快意的清香；……。這樣，雖然是一間小小的亭子間或前樓，經過了她們底「藝術地」佈置之後，便就非常的雅緻了。</p>
<p>「衖堂大學生」多半是自己燒飯，據說這是依據衛生學的。不過，這裏有一件困難的事，即是旣然自己燒飯，便須自己買菜。在萬目睽睽之下，如果以「大學生」的身分提着菜籃去買菜，那是多麽羞人的事呀！這不得不另想巧妙的辦法。於是聰明的「衖堂大學生」去買菜時，便不提菜籃去，只是暗中拿了幾張報紙去把菜買好了包回來。這樣，便不怕人笑了，因爲拿着一包報紙包着的東西在馬路上走過，誰也看不出這是買菜歸來的模樣的。在買菜中，他們還有許多「風流艶史」，譬如與賣豆腐的姑娘講笑話，吊别人家少奶奶的膀子等等；不過，在他們中最流行的，是他們常在人衆擁擠的時候，愛偷偷地去摸那「漂亮」的姑娘底臀部，據說這可以調劑枯燥的生活。</p>
<p>「衖堂大學生」也和在學校裏讀書的學生一樣，除不時看書寫文章外，在閒暇無事時，總愛哼兩句京戲，打幾圈麻將，或看電影，玩公司，借以消遣。不過，這些都不是他們底主要特點，他們底主要特點是愛吹牛。他們常是從這裏得到一點消息，到那裏去吹；同時，又從那裏聽得的新聞，到這裏來講；無論在什麽地方，只要他們一吹起牛來，都是天花亂墜，滔滔不絕地談下去；他們可以由國際政治吹到某文學家底生活，吹到某女士底眼睛和大腿，吹到一切；假如不是因爲要喫飯和睡覺的話，他們眞可把一切宇宙問題，人生問題吹完，這在時間上當然是没有限制的。</p>
<p>如果你高興，要問問「衖堂大學生」底希望是什麽時，那我可以告訴你：他們底希望很多而且很大，他們希望抗日勝利，希望革命成功，……不過他們最切身的希望却是：家庭或親戚朋友快點匯錢來，愛人寫信來！</p>

<p>— 龐成器</p>
<p>人是社會的一份子，職業是社會組合的單位。人們同社會的關係，就是直接連繫着每一種職業與人的關係。</p>
<p>一個社會，假使裏面的份子，每一個對於本身的職業有相當的興趣，這樣，自然他會好好地去努力，努力他所能發生興趣的職業。但是，在現代社會制度矛盾的漩渦中，一個工學士當書記，一個農業家做歷史敎員……這一種張冠李戴的事情，是不算什麽希奇。這是什麽緣故呢？簡明的回答說：爲了求個人的生存。</p>
<p>大部份人們把職業只當作生活的手段，這裏所謂生活，牠的意義就是使自己有飯吃。一切物質生活的壓迫，飢餓的威脅，使每一個人無可奈何的在不配自己的興趣的職業生活中，感受極端的痛苦。</p>
<p>但一切事情總該有相當的解决方法，我們當然不能說一個人可以不吃飯而去追求熱烈的夢想，我們也不能使自己呆呆地等待自己所需求的世界到來。因此，在這種不發生一點興趣的，甚至是厭惡的職業中，應該有一點實際上的補救。</p>
<p>最好自然是重新去找興趣相當的職業，但這在大部份人是絕對不可能的，因此，我們第一是要審察自己的職業，對於社會的關係程度如何。假使這關係是密切的，甚至有一點意義的，那麽，我們必須很詳細的審察自己，爲了一種有意義的事情，我們把自己的興趣設法俯就職業，而在這環境裏學習，等待有用的日子到來。</p>
<p>反之，若這個職業對於社會是没有什麽意義，那末，我們爲了担心自己被將來的淘汰，必須在職業範圍以外，在可能中學習一些另外的事情，隨着自己的興趣，努力着凖備跑到新生活裏去。當然，爲了眼前的生活，暫時不能放棄自己不發生興趣的職業，爲了生活呀！</p>
<p>我們提出兩句話來結束：在職業内外學習，在生活圈裏掙扎！</p>

<p>— 靜思</p>
<p>麫包問題纔得解决，不幸爲了讀過幾年書，又發生了求知慾的恐慌。在目前的經濟制度下，這兩個問題同樣和金錢發生着密切的關係，因此，窮小子「兩者不能得兼」，只好暫舍後者而取前者。然而，「得隴望蜀」是我們人類普遍的心理，衣食固能解决生理上的飢餓，而知識却能療治心靈上的飢餓。起初也曾買些書來查查看看，但日子久了，終覺得「獨學無友」，致「事倍功半」，而且專門技術如算術公式等等，都非請敎老師不可，以此我乃憧憬於學校之門。</p>
<p>在兼顧麫包和求學的條件之下，不得不使我找尋業餘的夜校。可是找尋學校，在我是没有經騐的，只有廣託友朋代爲留意。後來終於達到了目的。據介紹者說，這是全市掛第一塊牌子的學校，因爲他是「×立的」。說到×字，雖並未使我吃驚，但自己想想「旣掛第一塊牌子，那末，聘請的敎授必定都是飽學之士吧？」於是我便毅然的報名進去。</p>
<p>學費，雜費，講義費，報告費……統統繳齊，便得入學，並未逢到什麽難關。繳「費」入學，這是目下各校一例的吧？我想。</p>
<p>也許是我的世故太淺了吧？怎麽人家都以爲極平常的事情，在我總覺得有些異樣，而不免大驚小怪起來。</p>
<p>第一個印象使我感到異樣的，便是籌備開學的事務員，爲了學生登記，報名，繳費等事而忙碌異常，以致開學比人家遲了兩星期。上課後三四個星期，纔拿到油印的課程表，還要我們在表上七改八改，改得只好自己重寫一張。這種情形，在我當時還抱着熱望的信念之下，曾爲牠譬解：「這是事務員的事情，幸而與授敎們無涉……」</p>
<p>可是接着發生了第二個印象，該校敎授似乎個個都忙得不能分身，每晚揭示處有「某某先生因××事請假，××課暫缺」的條子二三張。所謂暫缺，實際就是永缺。也有臨時（？）發生事故，並不通知敎務部，所以不貼請假條子的也常會碰到缺課的事情。老資格的學生，碰到此種事情，照例等待五分鐘作鳥獸散，耗時間，費車資，空跑一趟，……都是「司空見慣」，不以爲意的。但是，「敎授上課，爲什麽這樣隨便呢？」經我細細打聽之後，一個老同學替我解釋說：「這有什麽難懂？上一課，三塊半錢，缺一課，照扣好啦！有什麽大不了！而且學校裏不也就可省了幾課修金的支出嗎？」</p>
<p>綽號呌「好人」的敎授，右手心裏握着豆腐乾大小的一方稿紙，左腋夾着點名簿走進敎室，照例張着笑口，眼光把全室一瞥，開始點名，呼唱「蜜司脫×，蜜司脫×……。」這樣費去三分鐘。「先生，你喊錯了，她是蜜司，不是蜜司脫！」小張指着一位女同學說。「晤，我常常忘記，下次總要改正牠。」接着是哄堂大笑。於是從天氣談到女人的服裝，又費了十分至二十分鐘，纔開始把稿紙騰上黑板。字大板小，寫滿了一黑板，照例停一停，等全體抄在筆記簿後，纔逐條解釋。「眞巧！先生所講的常常和寫出來的「銖兩悉稱」，不多一些也不少一些，」一個學生說。「晤，……」這是先生的回客。但是先生的時也自知缺少發揮，於是拉些「外國怎樣怎樣，我從前在紐約是這麽這麽……。」下課後，我一數，共抄十三條，一百五六十個字，而這些所抄的大綱，即使不用參考書，也似乎想像得出的。</p>
<p>有一天，我跟「好人」下了課，輕輕對他說：「先生，你何不把預備的講義交給敎務部油印分發，這樣，不但大家可以省力，而且先生也有充分的時間可以講解了。」「您不知道嗎？我兼了某校某校的課，忙得不得開交，……這些講義都是上課前五分鐘臨時摘錄起來的呀！」我佩服他的誠實，因而原諒他的苦衷，只是心中又想：「可惜，你又替校裏省了每人四元的講義費了。」</p>
<p>「好人」的缺課居全校第一，統計其原因，則疾病佔三分之二，其他因事的又頗多可笑之處。某次上課時，學生照例問：「先生，你上次爲什麽不來？」「晤，我乘電車，已到半路，碰着知友某君對我說：「今天是××紀念日，你幹麽還要趕去上課？」我一想，不惜，便……」「你爲什麽不打一個電話到校裏？害我們像「癡漢等婆娘」……。」又來了一個哄堂大笑。然而他郤從未遇到學生的反對，會有什麽罷課打倒的事情，那是因爲他有二種武器，除了永不發怒外，最重要的是各種考試時的通融。</p>
<p>使我渴望學校的信念從沸點降到冰點的事情，當然還不止上述的幾件，這在生平從未踏進大學之門的我·自不免有些大驚小怪，而對於小說中所描寫的大學生活，至此始信並非完全虛構。</p>
<p>有人說：「社會就是一個大學，讀書不一定要進學校，而且要求眞實的學問，也只有投身社會方能獲得。」話原不差，我只有退學，反身到社會裏來努力探求。可是，你要知道，我天天爲了麫包，做着刻板的事情，環境是單純而乏味，交接的又是奸詐的市儈，試問你學得到什麽？唉！繁盛的都市，我從今纔知道，在你懷裏，不但麫包難於尋求，就是知識的空虛，你也不能充分的供給，你只是一個繡花的枕頭！</p>

<p>我們的辦法是利用互助的精神，作互相的研究和探討，以通信方法來間來答。這樣，我們非但能夠增進知識，又可以多交朋友，甚至所有學徒都是我們極親密的朋友了。</p>
<p>以上是我們的提案，至於一切組織條例，尙有待於未來的各位會員發表意見，參商擬定。願加入者，請函新北門口七號天成祥珠號轉交錢小俠，或南京路廣西路三百四十一號中西商號胡人靈收。</p>

<h3 id="c361">蛋懸水中 <a href="#c361" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e361" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">361</a></h3>
<p>— 謝西林</p>
<p>丨科學游戲之一丨</p>
<p>這是一個物理上有趣的把戲，我們利用業餘的時間，不妨來玩一下子，所費旣無費，而又能由此得到物理上一個重要的原理。現在我把它寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）需用物品：新鮮鷄蛋一，高寛玻璃瓶一，内滿儲清水（冷水）及鹽一包。</p>
<p>（二）方法：先把蛋置入瓶裏，因蛋比水重，故沉於瓶底。現在把鹽逐漸一點一點放進水裏，一方面把水攪動，使鹽很匀的溶解。至鹽放到適當分量時，鷄蛋便完全服從你的命令。你把它提起，置於瓶的中央，你的手只管拿開，它依然停着不動。你再把它提高或放低，它也惟命是聽，不敢擅自動彈。</p>
<p>（三）理由：因爲鷄蛋的比量較清水大，所以蛋下沉。水裏加鹽，使清水變爲鹽水，鹽水的比重大於清水，鹽加得越多，比重也越大。鹽水和清水的比重相等時，那末蛋就不浮亦不沉，停於水之中部。假使再加鹽，使鹽水的比重比蛋更大，那蛋就浮在水面了。</p>
<p>（四）附說：我們知道耶路撒冷城之東，有一個鹹水湖，名曰死海。那裏面的水，含有百分之二十五鹽分，比重特别大，無論什麽人跑到那裏面去，都可以很安全的游泳。</p>

<p>— 里仁</p>
<p>人物：警察，暗探，失業者，看熱鬧的人們，巡查官，又一警察。</p>
<p>時間：×年×月×日年後。</p>
<p>地點；碼頭邊。</p>
<p>佈景：台正中有一根電燈柱，柱上掛一個長方形玻璃櫃，玻璃上面寫着：「救命圈，非到緊急時候，不得打開」等字樣。周圍堆放着一些裝貨的箱子。暗探和警察一同出現。</p>
<p>暗探：（對警察）你留心着那一面，有一大堆人在那裏，一定是他們，哼，他娘的……</p>
<p>…　…警察：（向周圍看一看）他們眞的會打起來麽？外國人怎麽樣吧？我實在弄不明白。</p>
<p>暗探：哼，你等着瞧吧，他們準還要什麽遊行，呌打倒什麽的。那些蠢傢伙，一家是有人在裏面搗亂，我就不相信什麽呌做帝國主義。</p>
<p>警察：不過……</p>
<p>暗探：「不過」什麽？你難道也會跟着他們去發瘋麽？</p>
<p>警察：倒不是這意思，我想他們也實在太苦了，你昨天没有聽他們說，繳了買辦六百元的押金，才弄到手一個火夫的差使，現在買辦不用他們了，就呌他們滾蛋，有這樣的道理麽？</p>
<p>暗探：這只能怪火夫自己不好，要是我，就不去弄那樣的差使。你們的薪水是多少一月？</p>
<p>警察：唉，就不得，八塊大洋，還喫自己的，最近還欠……</p>
<p>暗探：（頗得意）我們是四十塊正薪，辦一次案還有賞；我們的頭目，那就不曉得比我們多多少了。（突然向警察耳語）那面來的那傢伙，形跡可疑，你看管着他，我過那邊去一會兒就來。（說着向左下）說不定有你的好運氣。</p>
<p>失業者：（衣衫檻　限憔悴的樣子上塲）哼，（自言自語）碼頭上也没有生意……昨天，前天，大前天，一個月，五個月，快有半年没有事情做了。餓了幾個月的肚子，老婆，還有他狗養的小孩子。唉，算了吧，還活着幹麽？（走到江邊，注視了一會兒，警察很奇怪的監視着他。他看了一會之後，又回頭周圍看一看，凖備撩衣向水裏跳）</p>
<p>警察：（大聲的咳嗽）</p>
<p>失業者：（被警察的咳聲所驚動，没有跳，回過身來走了一兩步，口裏喃喃地說）警察這東西眞是再可惡也没有了，你要活的時候，他會拿着哭喪棒打你；你要死的時候，他却拖着你，……（帶有種神經質的笑）哈哈哈哈……（笑聲突然停止了，他已經站在「救命圈」的電燈柱前，揉揉眼睛，驚奇的看着那幾個字，慢慢地唸着）救命圈，非到緊急時候，不得打開！呵，我有救了！我有救了！（發狂一般，呌着，立刻舉起拳頭，向玻璃櫃打去，噹的一聲，玻璃碎了。這時警察已跑到他背後，提着他的衣領一拖，他向後倒退了兩步，手上被玻璃割破，染着血。）</p>
<p>警察：你幹嗎？（失業者大爲憤怒，以爲要搶他的救命圈，就向警察撲過去，兩人扭做一團，周圍漸漸有看熱鬧的人走來。終於失業者因氣力不足被按在地上，警察以出警笛狂吹，先前的暗探跑來）</p>
<p>暗探：（帶玩笑的口吻向警察說）你果然碰着好運氣了。（提起臃腁的「火腿」，用勁踢那失業者）你媽的，還敢騷動麽？</p>
<p>警察：（站開，失業者掙扎着起來不是騷動呢，（用手指那救命圈櫃）是打那東西的。（看熱鬧的人們閧笑）</p>
<p>暗探：（有些難爲情的樣子）啊，什麽？不是騷動？（巡查官帶着又一警察來）</p>
<p>巡官：什麽事？</p>
<p>警察：（立正，舉手）報告，這個人打壞了救命圈，想逃，我把他抓住了。</p>
<p>巡官：（走到失業者面前）你幹嗎要打壞那東西呢？</p>
<p>失業者：（直率地）我要　救我的命呀！……（巡官及其餘衆人都喫一驚）</p>
<p>巡官：牠怎麽能救你的命呢？</p>
<p>朱業者：那上面不是寫明白的麽？「非到緊急時候，不得打開」。我餓了好幾天的肚皮，五個多月没有工做了，我還有老婆，兒子，還不是緊急的時候麽？（人們聽了都笑起來）這個警察他還想搶我的呢。</p>
<p>巡官：（忍住笑）你打壞公家物件，還胆敢毆打公務人員，（向一警察）把他帶回局裏去！</p>
<p>失業者：（可憐地）我没有犯罪啊，先生，我要救我自己的命呀！……</p>
<p>巡官：（生氣了）走！不走？（給他一記耳光。失業者埀頭無言，跟着警察走去。遠處有羣衆喊聲：「大家上輪船去」！「要回六百塊錢」！巡官，警察，暗探急急向發聲處跑去，幕閉。）</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Liu Wenlong and Sheng Shicai telegraphed the Beijing office, saying that on November 22nd, our army defeated Ma Zhongying's troops in Fudao, killing more than 600 bandits.

All these situations have been reported by telegram to the Central Government, but the Central Government has not yet replied, fearing that it does not understand the new situation. The reason is due to Wu Ying, a member of Ma Bandit Zhongying, deliberately spreading rumors and reactionary propaganda abroad. Dihua is now quite peaceful, and the bandits in the east and west have been eliminated. He Jia Niyazi, commander of the South Road, together with Manhan Wang, has occupied Yanqi and entered Qingshuihe, and is now preparing to jointly suppress the Ma bandits with the provincial army, with the aim of eliminating them on schedule. It is hoped that the above situations will be forwarded to the central government to clarify the truth. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>

Fan Brigade attacked Fengchi Pass from Cheng Ziliang, flanking the enemy's left side, and ordered Liao Brigade to attack the bandit's Yuhuang Temple position from the line of Lanzhaizi Chongshi Village to divide the bandit's forces. From noon to dusk, they fought fiercely for eight hours.

Apart from the battles of Mugua Shop, Sanlong Temple, Tianbao Village, Dafeng Mountain, Sanjiao Village, and Phoenix Mountain, Zhou Brigade Commander forcibly crossed Sanhui and attacked Anhuaizhai and Jingangzhai, and Liao Brigade forcibly crossed Jiaxi Bridge and attacked Chongshizhai, Meng and Fan Brigades recovered Suicheng, surrounded and confiscated more than a thousand bandit rifles, captured more than a thousand prisoners, killed dozens of bandit regimental commanders and regimental instructors and battalion commanders, and the bandit soldiers are too numerous to count, while our army's officers and soldiers were also injured in hundreds.

<p>(Nanchang) Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek replied to the Central Party Headquarters and the Executive Yuan on the 21st, saying, Wang Seventeen's telegram inquired about the land policy, but the bandits have no policy to speak of except for using land as a means of struggle. I never thought that fellow comrades still regret that the government has not been able to imitate their land policy. Now, the land needs to be managed and organized urgently. Distribution must be done through peaceful means and through cooperation to achieve the goal of "tillers own their land". The promulgated land reform regulations and cooperative regulations have already taken shape. (Special telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek believed that in recent years, the red bandits have used land policy to divide the land and entice the peasants, encourage resistance and disrupt society. The Headquarters of the Encirclement and Suppression of Bandits in Henan, Hubei and Anhui provinces once promulgated the Land Disposal Regulations and the Detailed Measures Attached to the Cooperation Regulations to correct this. Recently, due to the rebellion of the Fujian rebels, the so-called method of distributing land by population was also used as a tool to deceive the peasants. In order to clarify the party's advocacy of land policy, Chiang specially telegraphed Wang Jingwei and Ye Chucang, detailing the measures taken to deal with the land problem over the years, and strongly criticized the red bandits' actions in the land policy, providing them to the Central Committee for research and reference.

<p>(Nanjing) The Grand Canal Rehabilitation Discussion Group, jointly formed by eight agencies including the Huai River Conservancy Commission, was established in Nanjing on the 21st. Wang Huzhen was appointed as the chief engineer. Wang stated that the first step in the Grand Canal waterway rehabilitation plan is to collect surveying materials. During Duan Qirui's administration, a detailed survey of the Grand Canal was conducted. However, after Duan's resignation, the Grand Canal's rehabilitation was never implemented. The original survey maps are now scattered and incomplete. In order to save expenses and simplify procedures, the old survey maps will be collected for reference. The first year of the association's work will focus on this matter. The second step is to dredge the waterway. In the past, tribute grain could be transported directly from Guazhoukou to Beitongzhou. After the abolition of tribute grain transport, navigation became prominent, and the river water gradually became shallow. South of Guazhoukou, steamships with a draft of two feet can pass unimpeded all year round. However, ships with a draft of four feet cannot pass when the water is shallow. In the future, the dredging plan aims to allow ships of one thousand tons to pass freely. The general office is located in the Huai River Conservancy Commission, the location of the eight agencies. Each will set up an office. The Yangtze River Waterway Rehabilitation Commission has sent a letter requesting participation. The regular expenses will be shared by the agencies. The project funds will be requested from the government. The association will start working on New Year's Day next year. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Administrative Court, in order to adjudicate the disposal of official property and the release of uncultivated land, deemed it necessary to investigate administrative precedents. It sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance requesting an immediate reply. The Ministry of Finance replied with four points: (1) The disposal of state-owned land and the release of uncultivated land are handled in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Beijing government or the separately formulated regulations, as no new laws and regulations have been promulgated since the establishment of the National Government. (2) Special bureaus have been established to handle the salt field official property in the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hebei. However, due to the different situations in each province, there are no unified measures. For example, the salt fields in Jiangsu Province are handled in accordance with the Regulations for Clearing Jiangsu Salt Fields promulgated in the fourth year of the Republic (1915). The salt fields in Zhejiang Province are handled in accordance with the Regulations of the Zhejiang Salt Field Bureau. The reclaimed land in Anhui Province is handled in accordance with the established cases in Anhui Province. The official property in Hebei Province is handled in accordance with the Regulations of Hebei Province for Handling Various Official Properties. (3) In areas where no bureaus have been established for clearing, any newly accreted tidal land shall be temporarily handled by the provincial finance department. (4) If the salt fields already owned by the people collapse, the property rights will be extinguished. Because the situation of the salt fields is different from the people's land in the inland rivers, when the east collapses, the west grows, and when the west collapses, the east grows. If permission is granted to allocate and replenish the same amount, the households whose land has collapsed will inevitably rise up and argue, and the disputes will never end. Therefore, it was previously requested that it be stipulated that when the salt fields collapse, it must be reported for tax exemption, and those who do not report for tax exemption and wait for replenishment should be strictly prohibited. Article 6 of the Regulations for Clearing Jiangsu Salt Fields promulgated in the fourth year of the Republic stipulates that if there is any vacant tax quota, it shall be exempted. Article 21 of the Rules of Procedure of the Branch Bureaus of the Zhejiang Salt Field Bureau stipulates that "No disputes shall be made on the grounds of mother-child reproduction, underwater tax payment, etc." The handling of salt fields in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces is based on the aforementioned regulations.

<p>(Nanjing) Deng Baoshan, commander of the newly编第一军 (New First Army), Ma Hongbin, former chairman of Gansu and commander of the Ningxia-Gansu Border Bandit Suppression Zone, Lu Dachang, commander of the newly编第十四师 (New Fourteenth Division), and citizen representatives Zhang Jian and Xu Shaolie, submitted a report to the Executive Yuan, stating that Jin Shuren's detention was based on the private signing of commercial agreements. In fact, they were not clear about the situation in the border province. They believe that Jin's handling of military affairs may have been unsuccessful, but his years of hard work to maintain the situation should not be completely dismissed. When former chairman Yang of 民十七 (1928) suddenly suffered an unexpected event, people's hearts wavered. Jin proposed to stabilize the situation, making the border situation safe from danger and relieving the central government of worries about the west. Baoshan and others, out of public and private feelings, could not bear to sit idly by and presented the facts in the hope of rescuing him. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>— Ying</p>
<p>More than twenty years have passed since the founding of the Republic of China. On what day has internal warfare ceased? Since the September 18th Incident, the Northeast has fallen, and foreign troubles have just begun. Internal troubles are even more urgent. Now the Fujian Rebellion has broken out again, and the Central Army is confronting the Fujian Army at the border of Zhejiang and Fujian. The Southwest is also vacillating between separation and integration with the Central Government. The interior of Sichuan and Jiangxi is indescribable. Other provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, although there are no major disturbances, are plagued by bandits everywhere, and the countryside is declining, making it difficult to find a piece of pure land. This is internal trouble. Border alarms, on the other hand, are increasingly urgent. As for Tibet, after the death of the Dalai Lama, internal changes are difficult to predict. As for Xinjiang, there is a dispute between the Sheng and Ma systems. As for the Northeast, after the loss of Rehe, eastern Chahar is increasingly dangerous, and the future of North China is very worrying. The coastal areas along the river have long formed a sphere of influence jointly controlled by various countries, making them particularly susceptible to the effects of entanglements. This is foreign trouble. At this time when internal troubles and foreign troubles are intertwined, what the Chinese people should not ignore most is, in addition to the Fujian incident, the two border alarms of Chahar and Tibet. Let us analyze them.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Beiping on the 21st of this newspaper, the situation in eastern Chahar is still tense. Cha Song Youqin will go to eastern Chahar to inspect the situation. It is heard that the Japanese and puppet troops are invading westward this time under the guise of suppressing bandits, but in reality, they are waiting for an opportunity to act with ulterior motives. Some say that the actions of the Japanese and puppet troops are a demonstration because the traffic negotiations have stalled, and another is a demonstration to prevent Zhang Xueliang from returning to the Northeast. In short, no matter what the pretext, the desire to occupy Guyuan in the north and invade Chicheng in the south is a planned and organized action, and not an accident that happened overnight. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan's entire policy has been to complete its dream of a continental policy through a tortuous method. Since the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union has no hope of easing, the westward base in Rehe must be completed as soon as possible. Today, when China is occupied with the Southwest and Fujian and Zhejiang, it is enough to promote its long-cherished wish for an active westward invasion. If it is said to be suppressing bandits, how can there be a major bandit rebellion in such a severe winter? Even if there is, why bother to do it on their behalf? This is undoubtedly taking advantage of the fire to rob.</p>
<p>The British background of the Tibetan issue is well known. According to a report in the Shanghai newspaper yesterday, "After the death of the Dalai Lama, although his power was handed over to the acting Silon, there were originally two factions in Tibet, the pro-China and pro-British factions. The pro-China faction is centered on the three major monasteries of Drepung, Sera, and Ganden. The pro-British faction is centered on Mazi. The disputes between Kham and Tibet over the years have been initiated by this faction. Now that the Dalai Lama is dead and Tibet is without a master, the conflicts are becoming more intense. If it is exploited by foreigners, the future will be difficult to manage. The central authorities are paying close attention to it." What is reported is roughly the truth. In recent years, Britain's active engagement in political and economic activities in Tibet is nothing more than a manifestation of various plans to expand territory, develop markets, and consolidate its rule in India, which can be said to resonate with Japan's continental policy.</p>
<p>With China's current strength, it is not easy to suppress the local forces, and the local situation is eventful, production is declining, and all industries are at a standstill, making it even more difficult to handle. The arrival of foreign aggression is said to be due to the aggression of imperialism, but it is also due to the endless internal strife. Internal strife and foreign troubles are mutually causal. What strategies will our government and people use to break through this increasingly dangerous situation?</p>

<p>(Berlin) German newspapers have recently reprinted a report from a Paris newspaper's debate section, stating that German Chancellor Hitler recently raised the following three questions to the French government: (1) When will France begin to reduce its military equipment? (2) Which categories of military equipment will France's disarmament plan be implemented on? (3) To what extent will France's military equipment be reduced in numerical terms? The above three questions have not been officially confirmed or denied, so the Berliner Tageblatt and other newspapers only stated that if these questions have been raised to the French government, then in the current situation, it is the most natural proposal, because France is the country with the most military equipment among the great powers.

<p>(London) Yesterday, someone in the Lower House advocated that Britain's foreign policy should clearly state. The transcendent and liberal parties also made this claim. "The Economist" stated that a convention to guarantee peace cannot be established without Britain. This convention should also adopt sanctions to prevent the aggressors in Europe from using their skills. "The Times and High Tide Magazine" stated that if Germany firmly demands rearmament, then all countries should jointly respond to it. These are the views of the Liberal Party and the Independent Party. On the contrary, the government party's opinion is that Britain can only take on the responsibility of reconciliation. For example, the "News and Communications Daily," which is usually seen as representing Prime Minister MacDonald's personal opinion, said on disarmament that the British government should carefully consider Germany's military equipment proposal, one is to study the value of the proposal itself, and the other is to observe whether other countries can recognize this proposal as a basis for compromise. Without this compromise, there is no hope for the establishment of a disarmament convention. (22nd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Exhibits Signs of Favoring Agriculture Over Industry</p>
<p>Politically Calming Inflationists</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's silver policy, politically speaking, has restrained inflationists in Congress. This policy, at the very least, has satisfied the silver-producing states that support inflation. Although the increase in American silver coinage may not be substantial, the psychological effect could lower the value of the dollar, and the recovery of prosperity in silver mining areas would also benefit nearby regions. More importantly, there are signs that President Roosevelt favors farmers over industrialists and financiers. The Democratic Party has always supported southwestern producers and opposed eastern manufacturers, and the President's renewed expression of this stance explains Wall Street's unfavorable reaction to the silver announcement. Wall Street experts are now striving to minimize the importance of the President's silver policy, arguing that silver accounts for only one-thousandth of all commodity transactions. Meanwhile, the White House has received ten times more Christmas gifts and greeting cards than any previous president, mostly from ordinary people who see President Roosevelt as their protector.

<h3 id="e77">Additional Interpretation of the President's Declaration <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt, in a statement to the press, said that he views the prospects for stabilizing world silver prices as an excellent sign and that the methods stipulated in the Silver Agreement (referring to silver-producing countries limiting production and agreeing to purchase a portion of the output for coinage and currency reserves, while silver-holding countries limit sales of stocks) could be extended to other mediums of exchange in the future. General opinion here interprets the President's declaration to mean that Roosevelt seems to believe that if various countries can reach agreements, they can stabilize world currencies based on gold. Although Roosevelt did not explicitly mention the word "gold," that is his intention. Roosevelt also said that it seems that various countries in the world have already agreed to adopt bimetallism for their currencies, which is unprecedented and is an important point implied by the Silver Agreement. He hopes that other signatory countries of the Silver Agreement can follow the examples of India and the United States and implement this agreement. When asked about the government's silver purchasing plan, Roosevelt declined to comment directly but said that this plan merely implements the provisions of the Silver Agreement and that the Democratic Party's platform during the election campaign included raising the price of silver, and the silver purchasing plan is intended to fulfill this promise.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt said today that the United States intends to stabilize gold, stating that the purpose of the Silver Agreement is that various countries have jointly decided that one or two mediums of exchange will be standard currencies, which is unprecedented in world history.

<p>(Washington) The directors of the Federal Reserve Banks in the eastern United States suddenly held a meeting today that lasted for eight hours, adjourning late at night, which is unprecedented. This has led to numerous rumors, with many speculating that there will be significant developments in the financial sector in the coming days, but none have been confirmed. The directors from the western region were unable to attend due to the meeting being called too hastily. The content of the discussions is being kept strictly confidential by the participants. It is subtly suggested that Thomas's plan to raise gold prices, the bank deposit insurance scheme, and the US President's pressure on the Federal Reserve Banks to resume purchasing government bonds on the open market were all discussed. Recently, the Federal Reserve Banks have stopped purchasing government bonds, only purchasing on behalf of the Postal Savings System, the Rural Rehabilitation Administration, and the Public Works Administration. Furthermore, according to Jones, the director-general of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, it is estimated that 660 million yuan will be needed for 600 state banks to comply with deposit insurance regulations.

<p>(New York) Opinions in the mining industry regarding President Roosevelt's silver policy are divided today. While some say it is sufficient to provide jobs for the unemployed, major figures in the Utah silver industry are not satisfied with the President's actions and deem them harmful because silver industry leaders have always advocated for a ratio of sixteen to one. Senator Thomas supports the President's new policy but says that its scope is too narrow to greatly benefit foreign trade. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>(New York) Of the 66 countries that passed the Silver Agreement at the London Economic Conference, only the United States and India have taken measures to implement it so far. This situation is of great concern to the US government, which is now preparing to negotiate with other countries to get them to jointly take measures to stabilize silver prices. It is reported that the Washington government has tried to negotiate with the Bank of England or even the Bank of France, but the replies from both banks have been unenthusiastic. Therefore, there are rumors that because Britain and France have not expressed approval for the silver issue, President Roosevelt has decided to mint silver coins, hoping that the result of purchasing silver will raise silver prices and that Britain and France will follow the example of the United States.

<p>(London) British newspapers criticize the US silver policy and advise caution. Gold and silver brokers here are concerned that the high official prices may encourage silver production both inside and outside the United States. If the US government only purchases domestic silver, the high price of 64.5 pence that the US government hopes to achieve will be purely a domestic price and will have little relation to the world price. One expert expressed the opinion that silver prices may temporarily rise, but the President's actions ultimately represent a bearish point for the silver market. A Reuters telegram from Ottawa reports that silver mining stocks have soared today as a result of the President's announcement of his policy. It is widely believed that the Canadian government will now ratify the London Silver Agreement and increase its silver reserves. (Reuters Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>Leipzig - The verdict in the Reichstag fire case was announced at 9:07 this morning at the Supreme Court. The entire courtroom was silent. The presiding judge of the Fourth Criminal Senate, Pommer, read out the judgment: The defendant, Dutchman Van der Lubbe, was sentenced to death; the defendants Torgler and the three Bulgarian suspects were acquitted and released. Van der Lubbe remained motionless throughout, his expression unchanged while listening to the verdict. Only Torgler looked worried. When the judge read out the section of the judgment concerning the policies of the Communist Party, both Torgler and Dimitrov took notes. The audience listened to the verdict without reaction. The seats specially reserved for government officials by the court had long been vacant, but today a representative of Propaganda Minister Goebbels was present. In the spectator gallery were Dimitrov's mother and sister, and Torgler's wife, who were overjoyed and tearful upon hearing the acquittal. The pronouncement concluded at exactly 10:00, and the court adjourned. The defendants were escorted back to prison. The audience, crowding outside the door, all wanted to catch one last glimpse of the defendants' faces. (Havas Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>Six Hundred Representatives from Various Countries Attend</p>
<p>Mussolini Delivers Welcome Address</p>
<p>World Civilization Degenerating Due to the Poisonous Legacy of Capitalism</p>
<p>Hoping that Eastern and Western Nations Can Unite in Solidarity to Rescue It</p>
<p>Rome - The Asian Students' Congress opened today in the presence of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Six hundred representatives from countries such as China, Japan, India, Persia, Afghanistan, Siam, and Egypt attended. Mussolini delivered a welcome address, stating that the saying "East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet" has no meaning in light of historical evidence. During the two great crises of the world, both relied on the cooperation of Rome and the East for rescue, thus turning danger into safety. Western capitalist civilization has destroyed the unity and harmony that once existed between East and West, a unity that is the cornerstone of our entire history and on which European civilization was built. Today, this unity must be restored and made universal, or it will perish. The belief that Europe and the East must stand in opposition to each other stems from a mindset held by certain parts of Europe that cannot or will not understand Asia. A civilization built on capitalism and liberalism, which views Asia merely as a market for its products, is doomed to destruction. This is a matter of great concern to countries that have been degenerated by the poisonous legacy of capitalism. This reaction has been expressed in the revolutionary faith of Italian Fascism, which is fighting against a soulless and thoughtless civilization. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Rome - This morning, Asian students held a congress in the Caesar Hall of the Pantheon. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini attended and gave a speech, the final paragraph of which stated, "The ancient history of Rome has been as described earlier. Today, Rome and the Mediterranean are being revived through Fascism, and will reshape the world's solidarity. This is why the new Italy invites you to attend. World culture has faced two crises, bordering on collapse, and has been saved both times by the union of Rome and the East. World culture is now facing danger again. The existing systems and ideologies lack a soul and are merely obstacles to mankind. The Italians and Fascists commemorate the glory of the past and hope that the Eastern and Western nations will unite again to jointly rescue it." The Prime Minister's speech was translated into French and German. An Arab university student representative of the Asian students thanked the Italian Prime Minister in French. Finally, an Indian female student, dressed in a gorgeous costume, represented the Indian students in blessing the Italian Prime Minister and the Italian nation. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>

A section from the Nihon Shoki (Chronicles of Japan) will be chanted outside the bathhouse. At the same time, officials selected to twang the bows will repeatedly draw and release the bowstrings in harmony. The Grand Chamberlain Yuasa will then write the Crown Prince's name on six sheets of thin paper, which will be presented to the Crown Prince by the Chamberlain, the Grand Mistress of the Empress's Household, Takeya, and the head female attendant.

Finance Minister Takahashi summoned Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs Kuroda to his official residence on the afternoon of the 21st to hear about the prospects for the trade bill deliberation and tariff countermeasures. Finance Minister Takahashi proposed transferring broad dictatorial powers to the government to deal with international trade and ordered the administrative bureau to consider specific plans. Regarding this issue, Finance Minister Takahashi told reporters that the Japanese government should have broader dictatorial powers than foreign governments regarding trade management and retaliatory tariffs to deal with the ever-changing world economic situation. Tariff issues should be negotiated separately with each country to determine treaties. (Nichi-Ren Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>Surcharges on Chinese Goods Shipped to France are Particularly High</p>
<p>Should Request the Same Treatment</p>
<p>(Paris) France's abolition of surcharges on British imports is seen here as a major blow to the system of compensatory taxes levied on goods with devalued currencies. Although the French government is currently considering levying this type of surcharge on US goods as well, other countries that already levy it, such as Argentina, Canada, Mexico, Japan, Uruguay, and Paraguay, will apparently demand the same treatment as British goods. This type of surcharge was decided upon by the French government after Britain abandoned the gold standard in September 1931 to prevent dumping. Subsequently, the currencies of other countries followed Britain's lead and depreciated one after another, and the French government imposed surcharges on their goods one by one. A total of 24 places have been subject to this tax: Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Straits Settlements, Finland, Britain, India, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Paraguay, Portugal, Argentina, Sweden, Uruguay, Ceylon, China, the Federated Malay States, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Soviet Russia, the Union of South Africa, and Estonia. The tax rate is generally 15%, but the rates for China, Japan, Hong Kong, and Soviet Russia are particularly high at 25%. Portuguese goods are taxed at 20%, and Canadian goods are the lowest at only 11%. However, currently, in addition to Britain, Finland, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, and Estonia have also abolished the surcharge because they have concluded new commercial treaties or new trade agreements with France that grant preferential treatment to certain French goods. As for Britain, preferential treatment is expected to be given to French agricultural products, with the exception of potatoes. As for the United States, although the French government has repeatedly considered levying surcharges on US goods since abandoning the gold standard, it has hesitated to implement this policy due to the war debt issue between France and the United States, not wanting to severely damage American sentiment.

<p>All Pseudo-Military Corps Were Defeated</p>
<p>Wu Qiwel's Troops Achieved the Greatest Merit</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Taking advantage of the Fujian Incident, the Red bandits in eastern Jiangxi advanced in three routes into eastern Jiangxi. Their collapse is described as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e126">Central Route <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>On the Central Route, the bandits were commanded by Peng Dehuai, with the Pseudo-3rd Army Corps as the main force, supplemented by parts of the Pseudo-5th and 7th Army Corps. Advancing westward from Lichuan, the Nationalist Army's Northern Route, consisting of the 58th Column and several divisions, took an offensive approach to suppression. They encountered the 4th, 5th, 6th divisions of the Pseudo-3rd Army Corps, the 13th division of the Pseudo-5th Army Corps, and the 54th division of the Pseudo-7th Army Corps in Tuan Village and Dongshan, southeast of Lichuan. Zhou, the commander of the column, led his troops in a fierce attack, penetrating into Baogai Peak in Tuan Village on the morning of the 12th. Approximately three or four Pseudo-divisions of bandits resisted stubbornly. The Sheng and Li regiments of the Nationalist Army charged in hand-to-hand combat, one after another, breaking through the bandit lines in a fierce battle until Shen hour (3-5 PM). By dusk, Commander Zhou, fearing the bandits' skill in night attacks, ordered the Xiong regiment to build fortifications on the heights of Cuodou Village to secure the position. The bandits indeed launched a dense charge at night. The Nationalist Army, resting and prepared, responded calmly. The bandits attacked several times, but all attempts failed. On the morning of the 13th, they retreated towards Xiong Village. On the 16th, the Nationalist Army recovered Xiong Village. The remnants of the bandits fled from Desheng Pass to Taining and Jianning. The Nationalist Army continued to pursue them, taking advantage of the victory to recapture Desheng Pass, a vital gateway from Jiangxi to Fujian. Commander Zhou telegraphed the victory to the Advanced Headquarters, declaring that Tuan Village and Xiong Village had been captured, with 500-600 bandits killed, 2,000 wounded, 500 rifles captured, and dozens of machine guns.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Western Route <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The 4th Army, under Wu Qiwel, first occupied Chongren Wudu on the 9th. The bandits retreated slightly, ambushing themselves in the nearby mountains. Wu's army was preparing to build blockhouses when the bandit leader Lin Biao led the 1st and 2nd divisions (three regiments each) of the Pseudo-1st Army Corps and the 1st and 2nd Independent Regiments in a fierce attack on the Wu army's Shiqiankeng position on the morning of the 11th. The attack was fierce. Xiao Wen's regiment of the Wu army was responsible for the western defense. The outpost was thinly manned and was occupied by the bandits. The regimental adjutant, Huang Jingzhi, and battalion commander Chen Lü, fearlessly led two companies in a charge, recapturing the position. After repeated fierce bayonet battles, the enemy outnumbered them. The 2nd battalion of the regiment and Commander Xiao personally led special service company soldiers, adding reinforcements one after another, engaging the bandits in hand-to-hand combat, repeatedly charging until 4:00 PM, when all eight regiments of the bandits were routed by Wu's troops. On that day, Xiao's regiment, as a single force, fought against eight times its strength from morning to dusk. Falling one after another, they ultimately achieved victory, completely recapturing all positions and killing the commander of the Pseudo-2nd Division, Luo Bingnan (brother of the bandit army commander Luo Binghui; his head has been recovered and sent to the Advance Headquarters), as well as two bandit regimental commanders and over four hundred officers and soldiers. Bandit corpses littered the field. The remaining troops scattered and fled. Over a hundred rifles were seized (because Wu Qiwel ordered his officers and soldiers not to collect rifles or capture bandits, awaiting the clearing of the battlefield and joint requests for rewards with friendly forces). That evening, the bandits gathered their remaining forces and attacked all night, engaging in a fierce battle until the next morning. When the Nationalist Army's aircraft became active, Wu's troops still dispatched teams to attack, conducting a large-scale search of the mountainous forest. By the afternoon of the 12th, Wu's army had cleared the remaining bandits in the mountains, completely recovering all positions. The remnants of the bandits retreated to Donghuangpi. In this battle, the Xiao regiment's achievements were the greatest, and the sacrifices were also the greatest. Battalion commander Chen Lü, company commander Chen Zhanyuan, and five platoon leaders were killed in action. The entire army suffered over two hundred casualties. However, persisting for two days and achieving victory with fewer troops against greater numbers was a glorious achievement. Their valor was no less than that of the 34th Regiment of the 6th Division, which repelled the bandits in Lichuan two months prior.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Left Route <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The commander of the Pseudo-Jiangxi-Fujian Military Region, Xiao Jinguang, entrenched himself in Zixi. He was attacked by Xing Zhennan's troops on the 13th for the entire day. On the morning of the 14th, Zixi city was completely recovered. Furthermore, the commander of the Pseudo-Jiangxi-Zhejiang-Fujian Military Region, Tang Zaigang, led his troops to attack Yujiang and Guixi, attempting to destroy the Jiangxi-Zhejiang Railway. They were also defeated by Li Yunheng's troops. The remnants of the bandits retreated to their old nest in Yiyang. The Advanced Headquarters received a telegram from Commander Li yesterday stating that the entire Pseudo-10th Army, combined with approximately 3,000 independent divisions from various places, attempted to cut off Jiangxi-Zhejiang transportation and harass Guixi and Yujiang. He immediately ordered Zhou's brigade to suppress them from the west of Guiqi's Silichiao bridge. They made contact near the west on the morning of the 11th. After a fierce battle lasting half a day, the bandits were ultimately defeated, with over 500 bandits killed and spoils of war being investigated. Observing the situation on these three routes, it can be seen that the bandits in Jiangxi are not far from their demise.</p>

<p>Results of He Jian's Meeting with Chen and Li</p>
<p>Changsha Communication: After the Fujian Incident occurred, He Jian personally went to Lechang last month to meet with Chen Jitang. In early this month, he personally went to Yongzhou to meet with Li Zongren of Guangxi to discuss the current situation and the issue of bandit suppression. All parties attach great importance to this, but He has not yet publicly expressed the results, so few people know about it. According to a military officer, He's trip had two major tasks: (1) Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces decided to jointly suppress bandits. Because the Fujian side has reached a military agreement with the communists, the bandits in Jiangxi will have no worries about an eastern attack and will be supplied by the Fujian side. They will inevitably invade the Hundred Yues to the south or flee to the Three Xiang to the west. Moreover, the bandits are cunning, and there are fears that they will attack in the east and strike in the west. Therefore, it is necessary for the southwest armies to have practical contact and full preparation. Therefore, he went to Lechang last month to meet with Chen Jitang. In addition to agreeing on the attitude towards the Fujian Incident, he decided on specific measures for the southwest armies to jointly suppress bandits and provide mutual assistance. Also, because the actions of Li and Bai in Guangxi Province are of great importance, he met with Li in Yongzhou this month for two days of face-to-face talks. He argued that if Guangdong and Hunan provinces were to suffer from banditry, Guangxi would not be able to remain safe on its own and strongly urged the Guangxi army to assist in the suppression of bandits. Li agreed and established a joint defense and bandit suppression plan for Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, consisting of seven articles. Guangxi Province is preparing two divisions of troops as a supplementary force for bandit suppression. If the communists attack Guangdong or Hunan, the Guangxi army will mobilize at any time, regardless of territorial boundaries, and provide mutual assistance. All joint defense and bandit suppression measures have been telegraphed to Chen in Guangdong for approval. (2) The southwest provinces will issue opinions on national salvation. Under the meeting of He and Li, Li stated that due to the national crisis, many of the central government's measures over the years have not been completed. He intends to put forward a number of specific opinions on the future national salvation policy and request the central government to adopt them so as to achieve sincere unity and overcome the national crisis together. He agreed and exchanged views. As a result, the generals of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces will formulate concrete opinions, solicit the consent of the Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, and then contribute them to the central authorities or the Fourth Plenary Session on behalf of the southwest provinces for adoption and implementation. It is reported that He himself believes that the results of his month-long efforts are extremely satisfactory and has stated to others that the Fujian Incident will not affect the bandit suppression.

<p>Police Mistook Bandit Alert for Opening Fire</p>
<p>Chen Jitang Escaped Dangerously to Zengcheng</p>
<p>Other Tourists Suffered Instead</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Luogang Cave in the suburbs is famous for its lychees and fruit trees. On the mountain is Luofeng Temple, also known as a scenic spot. Recently, with the opening of the road from the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou, passing through Longyandong and other places, one can directly reach Luogang Cave. In summer, the red lychees are abundant, and in winter, the plum blossoms are in full bloom, making it a particularly beautiful scene. Luogang Town has a light railway connecting to the Nanyang station of the Guangzhou-Kowloon railway. The plum blossoms along the way can be smelled ten miles away. Recently, due to the winter season, the plum blossoms in Luogang Cave are brilliant, and many people go to admire them. On the 17th of this month, Chen Jitang and his wife drove to visit. In the evening, the tourists returned one after another. Coincidentally, the locals in Lianhe Town near Luogang Cave have a custom of celebrating the "robbing of the new groom," setting off gongs and firecrackers. At that time, it was a time of heightened defense. The Panyu County Guard Team in the area was on duty. Chen was returning from his visit to Luogang, and the car he was riding in was speeding along. The Guard Team did not know in advance and ordered the car to stop. Chen's car did not respond. The Guard Team thought it was a bandit vehicle and immediately opened fire. However, there was a bodyguard vehicle in front of Chen's car. The Guard Team's gunfire was concentrated on Chen's bodyguard car, like a string of beads. The bodyguards, surprised by the sudden gunfire, thought something unexpected had happened and quickly got out of the car and opened fire on the Guard Team. In the stalemate, Chen's car quickly turned back and drove straight to Zengcheng County, and telegraphed the provincial capital to investigate the truth. Only afterwards was it discovered that the Guard Team had made a mistake. However, they had already received quite a scare. On the morning of the 18th, Chen took a car back to Guangzhou, but on the afternoon of the 17th, in the incident where the police mistakenly opened fire, tourists on the road were killed and injured. When the Guard Team and Chen's bodyguards exchanged fire, a tourist car happened to arrive and was also hit by a volley of shots. There were two men and two women in the car. One man was Huang Dongsheng, and the other was Du Weiye (Chief Auditor of the Provincial Bank). The two women were both prostitutes. One of them, named Huang Yulan, was famous for her dancing and social skills. All the patrons and harlots came to admire the plum blossoms. Unexpectedly, extreme joy turned to sorrow, and they were caught in the midst of the incident. The car they were riding in was hit by more than ten bullets. Huang Dongsheng was wounded in the shoulder. Huang Yulan was hit by two bullets and bled profusely. Du Weiye was hit by a bullet in the back. The driver of the car was fortunate not to have been injured. Afterwards, they drove back to the suburbs and sent the injured to the Zhongshan University Hospital on Baizi Road for treatment. When they arrived at the hospital, the prostitute Huang Yulan had already died from her injuries. The two men were only slightly injured and the bullets had been removed, so their lives should not be in danger. (Evening of December 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e131">Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provincial River Affairs Conference <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Representatives from Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Gave Reports</p>
<p>Resolved to Request the Central Government to Allocate Funds for Dike Repairs</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: The third Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provincial River Affairs Conference opened at 10:00 AM on the 20th in the Shandong River Affairs Bureau. Those present included Chen Ruzhen, Director of the Henan River Affairs Bureau, Feng Chunxi, Representative of the Hebei River Affairs Bureau, Zhu Mingzhuo, Representative of the Henan Provincial Government, Zhang Lianjia, Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, and all staff of the Bureau. Zhang Shouqian, a representative of the Shandong Provincial Government, also participated, totaling over forty people. Zhang Lianjia presided over the meeting. After the formal opening, Chairman Zhang Lianjia reported, stating that the Yellow River runs through several provinces and has caused damage every year. This year, the breaches in several places are particularly severe, so we must find a way to manage it to fundamentally eliminate floods. Today, the directors of the River Affairs Bureaus of various provinces and representatives from all parties have traveled far to Jinan to attend the meeting. The significance is to discuss thorough solutions and jointly make suggestions to the central government to manage the Yellow River well and relieve the people's suffering. After the speech, Zhu Mingzhuo, the representative of the Henan Provincial Government, gave a speech, stating that dozens of counties in the three provinces depend on the river, and the area affected each year is extremely large. The meeting should decide on measures and submit a request to the central government for funding to manage it, and ensure that the measures decided are thoroughly implemented. Next, Chen Ruzhen, the Director of the Henan River Affairs Bureau, reported on the Yellow River water rise situation this summer. The water level at the Shaanxi Prefecture stations began to rise in mid-July and ordered all county magistrates along the river to defend the dikes, but they did not all arrive. By August, the water continued to rise, and the situation became more dangerous. Because public funds were difficult to raise, the work was very difficult. Therefore, the elements of river management are, first, funding, second, talent, and third, power. These three elements cannot be missing. Regarding the engineering aspect, although the breaches this year have been closed, if the dikes are not repaired, the danger will be even greater in the future, especially for the Zhengzhou Yellow River Railway Bridge. In the past, fearing that the flood would damage the bridge, the Pinghan Railway had thrown many stones to consolidate the bridge base, but it contained a great crisis, because the water must have a way out. If there is no way out, it will find a way out on the other side. Now, the stones thrown by the bridge block the water's outlet. The water is small now, so it can be tolerated, but during the flood season next year, it will definitely breach the north and south banks. This should be addressed urgently. Then, Zhang Shouqian from the Shandong Provincial Government made a speech. Finally, Zhang Lianjia replied. After the speech, a group photo was taken, and the meeting was adjourned. Also, the Hebei and Shandong River Affairs Bureaus both issued a written report at the general meeting on the 20th: (1) The report requested that disaster victims who were employed through public works still had no livelihood and that the dikes should be repaired. (2) The report on the progress of the breach closure in the northern section. Shandong Province also reported on the resolutions of the second three-province River Affairs Conference last year, reporting separately on those that have been completed, those that are being completed, and those that have not been completed due to various reasons.</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 21st, the three-province River Affairs Conference continued to meet, still chaired by Zhang Lianjia, to discuss proposals. There were five proposals from Henan, five from Hebei, and one joint proposal from the three provinces to request the central government to allocate huge funds to repair the dikes of the three provinces, for a total of eleven. The meeting discussed each proposal one by one. There was no break at noon, and it was not completed until 2:00 PM, when the meeting was declared closed. Regarding the joint proposal of the three provinces, the original text is as follows: "Regarding the proposed matter, the dike lines of the three provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong are thousands of miles long, guarding northern China and protecting the southeast, which is of great importance. However, they have been in disrepair for many years. The riverbed is silting higher and higher, and the dikes are becoming thinner and thinner. The dangerous situation is already precarious. After this year's floods in autumn, the water rushed and eroded, making the dikes even lower, resulting in many breaches. The shocking reality is a warning. If we do not seek immediate remedies and properly manage them, the damage will be terrible in the future. Rather than letting the lives and property of hundreds of millions of people sink into the aftermath of a breach and then spending huge sums to close it, it is safer to take precautions and repair it in advance. The pros and cons are obvious. Our responsibility is to speak out. We propose that the governments of the five provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong forward a request to the central government to allocate huge funds to actively repair the dikes to maintain river defenses and protect the people's livelihood. Is this appropriate? Please decide." It was resolved that the River Affairs Bureaus of the three provinces should prepare a detailed plan with attached diagrams and send it to the conference for compilation and submission to the governments of the five provinces and the competent authorities for submission to the central government for prompt planning and implementation to eliminate floods and protect the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>After the three-province River Affairs Conference was closed, the representatives of the provinces decided to go to Wangjia Pear Orchard tomorrow (the 22nd) to visit the siphon siltation project built by the Department of Construction and various river works. (21st)</p>
<h3 id="e132">Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Fully Completed <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Total Length of the Entire Line is 360 Kilometers</p>
<p>Construction Cost is Less Than Half of Other Roads</p>
<p>A Ceremony Will Be Held in Jinhua to Celebrate the Opening of Traffic</p>
<p>The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway has been under construction since March of the 19th year and has now been completed in four years. In addition to the Jianglan section (Jiangbian to Lanxi), which opened to traffic on March 6th of the 21st year, the Jinyu section (Jinhua to Yushan) continued to be built in November of the 21st year and opened to traffic to Qu County in November of this year. The track was laid to Yushan on the 28th of the same month, completing the entire line. The Department of Construction has scheduled a ceremony to be held in Jinhua on the 28th of this month to celebrate the opening of traffic.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the construction of this road, the authorities were limited by financial resources and familiar with the economic situation in eastern Zhejiang. There was no large amount of transportation at present. After several studies, it was decided to adopt a light rail wide-gauge plan to save initial construction capital, and all designs were reserved for future improvements. The total length of the entire line is about 360 kilometers, and the construction cost is about 13 million yuan. The average cost per kilometer, including general affairs expenses, is about 36,000 yuan, which is less than half of that of other roads. This type of light rail railway is particularly suitable for the initial economic development needs of our country. Therefore, after the construction of this road, the Yupi Railway in Jiangxi, the Longzhang Railway in Fujian, the Tongbo Railway in Shanxi, and the Chengyu Railway in Sichuan all planned to imitate it. The completion of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway is not only related to the transportation and prosperity of Zhejiang, but also to the future of our country's construction.</p>
<p>In recent years, the situation in Zhejiang Province has been relatively stable and construction has been progressing rapidly. Now, the Fujian Incident has suddenly broken out, attempting to invade Zhejiang, but the authorities are still carrying out construction, which shows that the defense of Zhejiang is consolidated and the desire for governance is particularly strong. The reporter has summarized the construction process and general situation of the line as follows, to commend the new construction project.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Construction Process <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province's initiative to build railways began in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China when Zhang Jingjiang governed Zhejiang. After Zhang left Zhejiang, the project was shelved. In the seventeenth year, Zhang focused on the Construction Committee and was ordered to govern Zhejiang again. He telegraphed Du Yuan to Zhejiang to re-survey the rough line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. This line starts from Zhakou in Hangzhou, follows the left bank of the Qiantang River, passes through Fuyang, Xianglu, Jiande, Lanxi, Qu County, and ends at Jiangshan, then extends to Yushan in Jiangxi. In June of the following year, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Engineering Bureau was established, but there were no designated funds for construction. The authorities then proposed building the Xiaochang Highway on the right bank of the Qiantang River (Xiaoshan to Changshan). To implement the initial plan to connect with eastern Jiangxi, the northern section of the originally planned Xiaochang Road line was extended to the Xixing Riverbank on the opposite bank of Hangzhou as the starting point, passing through Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Yiwu, Jinhua, crossing the Jinhua River, changing to Tangxi to reach Longyou. From Longyou westward, because there are automobile roads between Quzhou, Changshan, and Yushan, and the mountains between Changshan and Yushan are stacked, for the sake of saving labor costs and business relations, a section of the Jiangzuo line is still adopted, from Qu County to Jiangshan, extending to Yushan. The entire road has a trunk line of 336 kilometers. There is also a branch line from Jinhua to Lanxi, which is about 24 kilometers long. Since the entire road does not start or end in Xiaochang, it is called the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway again.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Project Overview <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>After the route was determined, the groundbreaking ceremony was held on March 9th of the nineteenth year. The section from the riverbank to Lanxi was first divided into two main sections and six sub-sections, which were constructed simultaneously. Later, due to insufficient funding, the work was delayed. After May of the twentieth year, the provincial government signed a loan contract with four banks in Hangzhou, and the work proceeded smoothly. On June 1st, the railway was opened to Jianshan, and on July 1st, it was opened to Zhuji. The laying of the tracks began, and the projects were completed one after another, and stations were opened one by one. On March 6th of the twenty-first year, the Jianglan section was completed, and the entire section was opened to traffic. This section is 195 kilometers long. From the start of construction to completion, it took exactly two years, with a total construction cost of more than 6,939,500 yuan. Among them, the provincial government used provincial bonds as collateral to borrow and allocate 3.6 million yuan from four banks in Hangzhou: Bank of China, Zhejiang, Xingye, Zhejiang Local, and China Agricultural and Industrial Bank. More than 3,353,490 yuan was raised by the provincial government itself. There were still 120,000 yuan deducted from the additional loan from the bank for the construction of the Jinyu section. The construction cost of the Jinyu section is estimated to be more than 6,110,000 yuan. Among them, the foreign material costs are allocated from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity of 200,000 pounds. The construction cost requires 3.56 million silver yuan. The provincial government will borrow another 2.5 million from the four banks in Hangzhou. The shortfall will be allocated from the remaining proceeds from the sale of the Hangzhou Power Plant. With the source of capital, it is divided into two main sections and eight sub-sections for construction. The entire section is 165 kilometers long and started successively between November and December of the twenty-first year. The Jinhua River Bridge project is the largest and started construction on December 20th ahead of schedule. By July and August of the twenty-third year, the laying of tracks began in sections, reaching Jiangshan in early October. Longyou was opened to traffic on the Double Tenth Festival, Qu County was opened to traffic on November 1st, and the laying of tracks reached Yushan on November 28th. The entire line was completed, and it took only one year from the start of construction to the present.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Stations on the Entire Line <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>There are a total of thirty-six stations on the entire line. Zhakou, Sanlangmiao, and Zaizhan stations are specially set up to facilitate the transportation of passengers and goods across the river and are limited to business operations only. Within the Jianglan section, there are Jingjiang, Jiangbian, Xiaoshan, Bailutang, Linpu, Jianshan, Meichi, Zhibu, Baimen, Zhuji, PaiTou, Anhua, Suxi, Yiwu, Yiting, Xiaoshun, Tangya, Jinhua, Zhuma Hall, and Lanxi, a total of twenty stations. Within the Jinyu section, there are Gufang, Tangxi, Huzhen, Longyou, Anren, Zhangshutan, Qu County, Jinjie, Houxijie, Jiangshan, He Cun, Xintangbian, Xiazhen, and Yushan, a total of fourteen stations. Currently, there are two direct passenger trains running daily on the Jianglan section, each round trip. There is one mixed train between Jiangbian and Jinhua, each round trip. A material train is temporarily used to transport passengers and goods between Jinhua and Qu County. After the entire line is opened to traffic on the 28th of this month, there will be two direct passenger trains between Jiangbian and Yushan daily, each round trip. There will be mixed trains running between Jiangbian and Jinhua, between Jinhua and Yushan, and between Jinhua and Lanxi, each round trip daily.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Scheduled Opening to Traffic <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Now that the entire line has been completed, the Construction Department has scheduled the entire line opening ceremony to be held at 2:00 PM on the 28th in Jinhua. At the same time, an exhibition of local products along the line will also be held, collecting local products from counties along the line and displaying them in one hall to facilitate observation by people from all walks of life. Moreover, since eastern Zhejiang is an agricultural area and cattle are a powerful tool for farming in our country, bullfighting will be held in Jinhua, hoping to take this opportunity to awaken the people of Zhejiang to pay attention to raising cattle. The Construction Department has already invited people from all walks of life to attend the ceremony at that time. Guests must gather at the Sanlangmiao Station in Hangzhou at 7:00 AM on the 28th, cross the river to Jiangbian Station, and receive a commemorative medal for the opening of the entire line at the reception office. They can take the train with the medal. The special train will depart for Jinhua at 8:00 AM. After the ceremony in the afternoon, they will visit the Jinyu section along the line at 7:00 AM the next morning. Guests who participate in the opening ceremony and do not go to Yushan can take the special train back to Hangzhou that night. The special train will have meals and lunch at the Jinhua Railway Station. One side of the commemorative medal for the opening of the railway is cast with a portrait of Zhang Jingjiang, the founder of the railway, and the other side is cast with the locomotive first invented by Stephenson. At that time, the Railway Bureau will not only distribute commemorative medals to the guests but also present a commemorative issue for the engineering record and the opening to traffic, and a record of the scenery of eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Inspection Notes on Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan and Hubei by Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent Ren An <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Miscellaneous Information After The Suppression in Southern Henan</p>
<p>According to communications from Jingfu, the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, such as Huangchuan, Guangshan, Gushi, Shangcheng, Huang'an, Macheng, Luotian, Lihuang (formerly the famous Red Area Jinjiazai), Huoshan, and Liu'an, have fertile land and abundant resources, and many are surrounded by mountains and valleys. There are many towns and mountain villages that are like enclaves, beyond the reach of military and political power. Wealthy families are often overbearing, and officials are corrupt. Loan and tenancy conditions are harsh, so the Red bandits were able to incite and agitate, leading to a prairie fire. Since the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the above-mentioned areas have been either burned by the Red flames or plagued by bandit gangs in more than twenty counties. In the past, the National Army conducted four encirclement and suppression campaigns, but ultimately, the Red Areas were too deeply banditized and there was no way to deal with the aftermath. Encirclement in one area led to banditry in another, and the problem was never resolved. This summer, Liu Zhenhua, Chairman of Anhui and Commander-in-Chief of the three-province border area bandit suppression, stationed in Huangchuan and supervised the army in a fifth encirclement and suppression campaign. After several months, the Red bandits collapsed one after another. According to reports, Liu, learning from the past experience of recovering bandit areas and seeing them rise up again, blamed the failure on the inability to deal with the aftermath. He has a new village facility plan and has established a new village office in Huangchuan to actively implement it. The reporter had long heard of his name and believed that his work might be a key to fundamentally suppressing bandits. He then took a train north from Wuhan to inspect southern Henan.</p>
<p>This time, the express train I took was well-ordered. At the beginning of the journey, I saw many bodies of infants abandoned in the woods beside the road. Although some were placed in small coffins, they were not buried. Perhaps this was because the area was still within the city limits of Wuhan and the police might interfere, so they were abandoned and quickly fled, which cannot be determined. However, there were still corpses hanging on tree branches, which was puzzling. In short, whether abandoned by the roadside or hanging on tree branches, they both hindered the hygiene of nearby residents and exposed the dark side of urban crime, which could not help but make passers-by cover their noses and murmur their disapproval.</p>
<p>The train passed Wusheng Pass and entered the XinDian station of Henan Province. At that time, the moon was shining brightly in the sky, and Jigong Mountain stood tall to the east. Numerous snow-white Western-style houses were built on it, set off by the dark black mountains and forests. Under the moonlight, the roofs of the houses could be seen clearly. According to Luo Mingjun, a Kaifeng resident who had visited the mountain for leisure, the mountain is fourteen miles high from the station to the top. The scenery of forests and springs is unmatched anywhere else. Every summer, people flock to escape the heat, no less than the bustling scene on the Shanyin Road. In particular, foreigners doing business and missionary work in Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei provinces often climb the mountain in the summer and return in the cool autumn, making it an annual trip. The top of the mountain is called "Jigongtou" (Rooster Head), and its shape is very similar to a rooster's head, hence the name of the mountain. Whenever the sound of the train is heard passing under the mountain, tourists always rush to climb "Jigongtou" to overlook the winding and galloping train, which looks like a swimming dragon, and all exclaim in admiration. During the era when the Northern Warlords were in power, important figures from the north and south also gathered on the mountain in the summer to hold meetings, build houses, and plant trees, competing to show off their wealth. There were more than 600 houses on the mountain, among which the villas of Wu Peifu, Sun Chuanfang, and Jin Yun'e were the most luxurious. Among the three villas, Jin's villa was the tallest, and the flowers and trees planted were the most numerous, reaching 20,000 plants. Jin once served as the military governor of Henan. During the Northern Expedition of the National Army, he intended to break away from the Beijing government and become independent, so he styled himself as the commander-in-chief of the Defense Army. He was then defeated by the Northwest Army. Tang Shengzhi's troops, the forward commander-in-chief of the Northern Expedition, later excavated countless treasures hidden in Jin's mansion on Jigong Mountain. It is known that the copper coins alone amounted to 750,000. Other details are unknown but it is easy to imagine. The mountain was not only a scenic spot for tourism but also held significant meaning in political substitutions. Compared with today's Mount Lu, it was almost more so. However, Mount Lu is becoming more prosperous day by day, while Jigong Mountain is only missed by a small number of people.</p>

<p>Shi Muru, a 27-year-old resident of No. 13 Dapi Lane, Dongmennei, Jiangyin, was quite wealthy. Because he was addicted to opium, he was often extorted by local ruffians. In anger, Shi came to the No. 31 Taiping Lane Hospital in Wuxi in the seventh month of the lunar calendar this year to quit opium. He agreed with Dr. Qian Zhongliang of the hospital to pay 226 yuan in silver for opium withdrawal, promising to completely quit the addiction within a month. Unexpectedly, after a month, he still had not quit. Recently, after Qian Zhongliang injected morphine into Shi, he suffered from alternating chills and fever, and his condition worsened. He died the day before yesterday. Qian knew that he had caused trouble and immediately hired a gasoline boat to send the body to Jiangyin. Shi's wife, Sun, saw it and was shocked. Yesterday, she came to Wuxi with her relative Gao Huaide to negotiate with the hospital. Unexpectedly, Qian Zhongliang had long since disappeared, and the hospital had also stopped treating patients. It is unknown how this murder caused by opium withdrawal will be resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Implementing the Widening of Nandiaoqiao Street <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The section from Nandiaoqiao to Daigouqiao is an important passage between the city and the countryside, but the streets are narrow, and the houses are close together. Vehicles and sedan chairs often overturn. County Magistrate Yan ordered the technical director Zhang Dezai to design the widening, which is scheduled to be implemented on January 1st, starting with the demolition. In recent days, the city engineering office has sent personnel to survey and set up central stakes, and together with the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, they have earnestly persuaded the residents in the area. Except for Jiang Zheqing, a resident of Daigouqiao, who has filed another appeal with the Construction Department, the remaining residents, Yao Zhiding, Ji Jinchu, Ji Rongchu, Qian Zishao, etc., have voluntarily demolished their houses in the past two days.</p>

They dragged his father out of his sleep, stabbed him in the chest with a sharp blade, forced him to reveal where the silver was hidden, and severely interrogated him by burning him with fire. They also ransacked the house at will. After checking, in addition to the loss of clothes and valuables, forty-four silver dollars stored in the box were also taken away.

<p>Huaiyin County borders Lianshui to the east, and the Liutang River runs across the two counties. This autumn, the people of Lianshui County built an earthen dam on the Liutang River in their county, which was close to the border of Huaiyin. This made it difficult for the water upstream of Liutang to discharge downwards. If there was a flood year with a lot of water, the river would inevitably burst in the fifth district of Huaiyin, which would greatly affect the farmland in Huaiyin. At that time, the residents of the two counties almost had a fight. The Fifth District Chief of Huaiyin, Cao Shiwen, stopped it to prevent an accident. The incident was known to the Eleventh District Administrative Office, which ordered the governments of the two counties to investigate and reply. Unexpectedly, the facts were different and the problem could not be resolved. Yesterday, Commissioner Lu presented the replies from the two counties to the province for special review to prevent accidents and asked the province to send personnel to re-survey to resolve the problem as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi Went to Hangzhou Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Accompanied by His Wife and Others, Will Return to Shanghai Today or Tomorrow</p>
<p>Said It Was Difficult to Agree to the Merchants' Request to Exempt Taxes on Flour</p>
<p>Consideration Still Being Given to Sorting Out Customs Duties, etc.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi took a train from Shanghai to Hangzhou at 3:15 PM yesterday to discuss important matters. He will return to Shanghai today or tomorrow. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the National Economic Council's Cotton Association, went to visit Kong to report on the progress of the work. At 10:00 AM, Kong met with reporters from various newspapers. The following is a record of his conversation:</p>
<h3 id="e154">Tax on Foreign Rice and Wheat <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Kong expressed his rejection of the request from flour manufacturers in this city to exempt taxes on foreign wheat that had already been purchased, and stated his reasons as follows: Merchants and the public from all over the country have requested the central government to levy taxes on foreign rice and wheat to alleviate the rural decline. The Legislative Yuan also believes that food and people's livelihoods are deeply related, and for the sake of alleviating the rural economy, it passed the levy of tax rates on foreign rice and wheat on November 17 and implemented it on December 16. There is a month between them, so the flour merchants in this city have long known that the Ministry of Finance will levy this tax. Now the merchants are using the excuse that the Ministry of Finance has not officially announced the import tax on foreign rice and wheat, and are requesting a tax exemption on 75,000 tons of American wheat that they have already purchased. The reasons are not sufficient and it is impossible to approve them. As for saying that I summoned wheat and flour merchants to the Central Bank at 10:00 AM yesterday morning to discuss the issue of tax exemption on foreign wheat, that is not true. Perhaps the flour merchants intended to make a request to me, but it was not me who summoned them. Kong also said that the tax rates on foreign rice and wheat currently levied by the Ministry of Finance are only slightly less than half of the highest tax rate passed by the Legislative Yuan, which can take into account the difficulties of merchants and the people's food.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Sorting Out Customs Duties <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>When the reporter asked whether the Ministry of Finance would implement an increase in customs duties starting on New Year's Day next year, Kong replied that the Ministry of Finance intends to sort out customs duties, but sorting out customs duties does not necessarily mean increasing all customs duties. There are many items in customs duties, and some need to be increased, while many need to be reduced. We will consider them separately and in detail. There are not many days left until the end of the year, so the saying that it will be implemented on January 1st is absolutely not true, and it is not possible in terms of time.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Levying Inheritance Tax <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance decided to levy inheritance tax, various newspapers have published opinions. On the whole, the opinions published are quite different from what the Ministry of Finance has decided. For example, the Shanghai banking community believes that after the inheritance tax is levied, investigations of foreign bank deposits and road deeds in the concessions will cause various difficulties. This is an overestimation. The procedures for the Ministry of Finance to levy inheritance tax are as follows: for example, if A has certain properties and several children, there must be relatives and clan elders presiding over the division of the inheritance after his death. At this time, the government will start to investigate the amount of his inheritance and levy taxes. It is expected that there will be no difficult problems. The tax rates and detailed rules are already being drafted.</p>

<p>Estimated by Those Familiar with Geography</p>
<p>Focus Will Be on the Chu Area</p>
<p>XinSheng News Agency reports that, according to those familiar with the geography of the Zhejiang-Fujian border, the Fujian army's invasion of Zhejiang has about three routes: (1) From Pucheng to Jiangshan, the Fujian army is currently concentrating in Jian'ou and Jianyang, (2) From Fuding to Pingyang, (3) Shouning, Taishun, Changshan, Kaihua, Songxi, Qingyuan, and other places can also be connected. The first route is the main road, while the latter two routes are small roads. Judging from the actual situation of each route, it is quite convenient for Zhejiang and Fujian to transport a large number of troops through the Xianxia Ridge, but it is very difficult to break through the various passes of Xianxia.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Labor Strike at Two Wusong Factories Heard of Yesterday <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Workers' Representatives Meeting Decides to Persist in Slowdown</p>
<p>Mechanics at Various Stations Express Support</p>
<p>According to the Da Gong She, a slowdown strike has occurred among all workers at the Wusong Zhanghuabang two railway machinery factories and the material depot to remove the head of the General Affairs Department, Mo Heng. The news from yesterday is as follows:</p>
<p>Workers' Meeting: Because they learned that the Ministry of Finance had dispatched personnel to Shanghai to investigate thoroughly, the Wusong machinery factory and material depot workers on strike convened a joint meeting of the officer in charge and group leaders at 6:00 AM yesterday to discuss countermeasures and decided that the head of the General Affairs Department and concurrently head of the material depot, Mo Heng, has slandered the Party and the country, destroyed labor movements, and the facts are there. Unless Mo Heng is first dismissed from his position and investigated, they will insist on refusing to resume work, with a very firm attitude.</p>
<p>Mechanics Petition: The Shanghai machinery factory branch offices of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways sent representatives Yu Shanjiang, Yu Zhenzhou, and over ten others yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, led by Cai Jinghai, director of the two railway labor unions, to the Two Railways Administration Bureau on North Suzhou Creek to petition and put forward two conditions: (1) Immediately dismiss and investigate Mo Heng; (2) If this cannot be accepted, then the Shanghai machinery factory workers will also express the same. The responsibility should be borne by the Bureau. Wang Bi, director of the Machinery Department, received them and promised to forward it to the director for review.</p>
<p>Consultation Methods: After the elected representative from the Central Committee, Wu Meihuan, and the advisors from the Ministry of Railways, Wang Wenbin and Zhang Weici, arrived in Shanghai, they first went to the Two Railways Administration Bureau to inquire about the details. At 10:00 AM yesterday, they convened a meeting at the Two Railways Administration Bureau with members of the special Party branches of the two railways, Bu Dexin and Chen Chengshi, directors of the two railway labor unions, Liang Luobing and Chen Bohua, and Wang Bi, director of the Bureau's Machinery Department, to discuss solutions. A decision was made on how to resolve the situation, and they went to Wusong together in the afternoon at 1:00 PM to persuade the workers again to resume work first to avoid prolonging the strike. As a result, the workers have shown willingness to accept, and it is hoped that work will resume tomorrow.</p>
<p>Zhabei Electric Support: The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Zhabei Machinery Factory branch office sent Shen Xiqing to Shanghai yesterday to express condolences and sent a telegram to the two railway labor unions to express support. The original telegram stated, "To the Two Railways Labor Union Council: The telegram is received. The slowdown at the Wusong factory has been going on for a long time. If the allegations of Mo Heng's betrayal of the Party for personal gain, destruction of labor movements, and endangering railway property are true, please investigate the truth and punish him promptly to resolve the situation as soon as possible and prevent the situation from escalating. Sincerely, Zhabei Machinery Factory branch office."</p>
<p>Response from Various Stations: After learning about the labor strike at the Wusong machinery factory, the workers at the Nanjing and Changzhou machinery factories convened meetings in their respective locations to discuss support and sent representatives to Shanghai to express condolences. The representatives are expected to arrive in Shanghai today and will request the Railway Bureau to remove Mo Heng from his position to appease the public. Otherwise, they will also take concerted action to achieve their goals.</p>

<p>According to yesterday's Japanese Daily News, the quantity of Japanese goods imported into Shanghai in October and November has reached over 20,000 tons. This month is the busiest trading month in history, and the import volume is particularly impressive. It has been found that by the middle of this month, it has exceeded 20,000 tons.

<p>Complete Resolution Expected by February Next Year</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng She, after the Shanghai Municipal Government authorities and the Public Concession authorities re-negotiated the issue of recovering the roads built beyond the border, both sides have a desire to resolve the issue quickly, and progress is smooth. According to the Xin Sheng She reporter, the negotiations and discussions between Secretary-General Yu and General Manager Fessenden of the Public Works Department are still based on the previous plan and not on the recommendations of British Ambassador Lampson. It is expected that the entire issue can be resolved by mid-February next year. The previous report that the concession side requested that no additional taxes be levied or branch roads be built after the roads built beyond the border are returned is completely untrue. Moreover, the procedures for these negotiations are entirely handled by the Municipal Government, and no concrete results have been reported to the Executive Yuan.</p>

<p>Huang Jintao Came to Shanghai Yesterday to Negotiate</p>
<p>Decision Pending German Reply</p>
<p>According to the Ri Ri She, the Ministry of Industry is preparing to establish the Central Iron and Steel Plant. The preparatory meeting, which started on the 19th in Beijing and lasted for three days, concluded the day before yesterday. It was decided that the plant site would be located in Ma'anshan, Anhui. Although the meeting decided to change the monthly interest rate on the loan from the German side to six per cent and the repayment of principal and interest would begin in the fourth year after the plant starts operation, the German side has not agreed. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry has specially dispatched Huang Jintao, Director of the Mining Department, to Shanghai with the resolution to consult with Kang Daofu, the representative of the German firm Hopes Company, on all matters. It is reported that Mr. Huang arrived yesterday and immediately visited the German representative Kang Daofu for consultation. It is heard that as a result of the discussion, the German representative still needs to consult Germany for instructions, and a decision can only be made after receiving a reply. Mr. Huang is scheduled to return to Beijing tonight to report.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Labor Disputes Arise from Workers Demanding Pay at the Fuxing Silk Factory <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Owners and Shareholders' Associations All Vandalized</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau and Others Have Been Trying to Mediate for Days</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng She, the Fuxing Silk Factory on Chang'an Road in Zhabei is unable to maintain operations due to the sharp drop in the silk market and huge losses. The manager has absconded, and over three hundred workers are demanding back wages, leading to disputes for days. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Course of Demanding Pay: After the manager of the Fuxing Silk Factory, Mr. Chen, absconded, he owed approximately four thousand yuan in wages to male and female workers. Over three hundred male and female workers formed a team to pursue the payment. The residence of the factory owner, Tao Yugan, on Huasheng Road in Zhabei, was vandalized by the workers when they went to demand pay the other day. The main gate and all the objects were destroyed by the workers, fortunately, the Fourth District Public Security Bureau dispatched police to suppress the situation, and they dispersed. The next day, all the workers believed that Ni Baotang, who lived in Nanlinli in Zhabei, was one of the shareholders, and they went to demand pay in a group. Because they could not get what they wanted, they destroyed the furniture in the house. Fortunately, the workers persuaded them to disperse. On the 21st, the workers again believed that Shen Xiangfu was one of the shareholders and went to the Siming Guild Hall to petition, demanding payment from Shen. They were persuaded to disperse by the French Concession police. On the 22nd, all the workers, holding incense and candles, went to Shen Xiangfu's house on Rue Pellesier to demand pay. The police dispatched armed detectives to persuade them, but it was ineffective. By evening, the police used cars to send the workers to Zhabei before they dispersed.</p>
<p>Efforts to Mediate: At 10:00 AM yesterday, all the workers crowded into the Sixth District Silk Industry Labor Union in Nanlinli, making a lot of noise. After being dispersed by the Labor Union Council, all the workers went to the Silk Factory Owners' Association on North Shansi Road at around 11:00 AM to demand pay. Because there was no one in charge, disputes arose. The Public Concession police dispatched detectives to persuade them, but it was ineffective, and they dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign armed detectives to suppress them. They dispersed at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Department had already sent personnel to mediate this case, but because Ni Baotang and Shen Xiangfu did not admit to being shareholders, it was impossible to resolve the situation for a while. The Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhu Guilin yesterday to work with Shen Huachen, Chairman of the Silk Factory Owners' Association, to mediate with all parties in an effort to resolve the situation as soon as possible and avoid escalating the labor unrest.</p>

<p>Ministry Approves That It Is Difficult to Approve</p>
<p>The National Goods Factory Federation received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating, "Regarding the submission requesting the maintenance of national iron and the imposition of anti-dumping duties on foreign iron, we have received it. We ordered the Anti-Dumping Goods Review Committee to review and reply that in recent years, foreign pig iron, mainly Indian iron, has been imported into our country. The selling price in Shanghai is still 70 to 80 yuan per ton. In addition, it is operated by Japanese capital, and the price of pig iron in the eastern provinces has no public market price. According to investigations, it is also sold for 40 to 50 yuan per ton. The selling price of 25 yuan per ton mentioned in the original submission cannot represent the wholesale price of the goods and cannot be used as a basis for dumping. Moreover, the pig iron in the eastern provinces used to be sold in the interior for 500,000 to 600,000 tons per year, but this year it is only over 200,000 tons. Therefore, it is still difficult to fully prove the dumping of foreign iron, etc. The Ministry has reviewed and found that the investigations of the association are all true. The request to impose anti-dumping duties on foreign iron is difficult to approve. You are hereby notified." Signed, Minister Kong Xiangxi.</p>

<p>Dear Citizens, sanitation campaigns have been held in this city more than ten times. The goal of each campaign is to take this opportunity to unite all citizens to work together to do a good job of sanitation, which is related to our lives. In addition to making every effort to eliminate things that hinder sanitation in the negative aspects, the Health Bureau and the Public Security Bureau will do some things that cannot be done by individual efforts in the positive aspects. If we want to do everything well in matters that everyone has a direct relationship with sanitation in order to achieve perfect results, then everyone must work together to help. Therefore, the purpose of the sanitation campaign is to ask all citizens to pay attention to the following words: (1) Cleanliness is the foundation of sanitation. Individuals should strive for cleanliness in their living places, food, and clothing. Publicly, streets and public places should also strive for cleanliness. (2) Maintaining street cleanliness can enhance the beauty of the city and the health of citizens. How can streets be kept clean? It depends on everyone's maintenance. Everyone should abide by the rules and not throw garbage everywhere. Even a small piece of paper or fruit peel should not be thrown on the road. Everyone should not urinate or defecate or spit phlegm everywhere. This will make the roads clean. (3) The word "sanitation" is not exclusive to the bourgeoisie. Regardless of gender, age, wealth, or status, everyone can practice sanitation and has the responsibility to maintain it. Shanghai 12th Sanitation Campaign</p>

<h3 id="e175">Japanese Side Refuses to Release Kim Seok <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Legal Discussion Between Two Lawyers</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng She, Kim Seok, a Korean who has become a Chinese citizen, was arrested without cause by the Japanese consulate in collaboration with the French Central Police on the 22nd of November this year. After repeated presentations of nationality permits by family representatives such as Chen Yang, requests were made to the Japanese and French consulates for his release, but to no avail. The Shanghai Municipal Government formally protested. The Japanese consulate initially delayed its response, but recently replied, stating that the Japanese government does not recognize Kim Seok's Chinese citizenship. This statement is not only contradictory but also contrary to modern international legal principles. Lou Yunmei and Xu Jie, the lawyers handling the case, have refuted the fallacy. The family plans to petition the Municipal Government and the French Concession authorities again tomorrow. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e176">Japanese Consul Has Already Recognized <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Lou stated, "Kim Seok was naturalized as a Chinese citizen in the 18th year of the Republic of China, not only with a permit from the Chinese government but also with the tacit approval of the Japanese government. Kim Seok and his son were arrested by the Japanese consulate in Shanghai in December of last year, and they were released because Kim Seok and his son had become Chinese citizens, which drew the attention of the Chinese government, which rigorously negotiated for their freedom. If the Japanese consul had not recognized Kim Seok's naturalization as a Chinese citizen last year, on what grounds would he have agreed to the release? If the Japanese consulate did not recognize Kim Seok's change to Chinese citizenship from the beginning, why did it not raise a dispute over nationality during the Chinese government's negotiations last year? It was not until this year that this fallacy was issued, which is not worth refuting. Japan claims to be a civilized country and should not have such contradictory actions. Therefore, based on the facts, Kim Seok's nationality issue can be said to be undisputed. Furthermore, in terms of legal principles, Japan's nationality laws do not deny Koreans the right to relinquish their nationality. The argument that people are the private property of the state and are not allowed to leave their home country has long been abolished except in a few uncivilized countries. Therefore, at the 1930 Hague International Law Codification Conference, there was a resolution on the following principles regarding the loss of home country citizenship due to the acquisition of foreign citizenship due to differing opinions among countries: 'Anyone who acquires foreign nationality through naturalization should lose their original nationality.' Kim Seok's naturalization as a Chinese citizen began in the 18th year of the Republic of China, and he has lived in Shanghai, China, for five or six years. Even if there is a question of nationality, according to international legal principles, he should be subject to the laws of the country where he resides and cannot be arrested arbitrarily."</p>
<h3 id="e177">French Police Station Should Be Responsible <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Although the French Concession in Shanghai has granted police power to the Central Police Station due to judicial agreements, the French Police Station is suspected of being hasty in not investigating the facts beforehand. Therefore, although the main body that harms Chinese sovereignty is the Japanese consulate, the French consul and the chief of the French police cannot escape responsibility. Article 7 of the agreement on the establishment of Chinese courts in the French Concession in Shanghai clearly stipulates that no offender may be transferred to a government office outside the Concession without first being tried by the competent court. The French Police Station's assistance to the Japanese consulate in arresting Kim Seok is a clear violation of the agreement by not following the above provisions. The agreement was negotiated by the French Minister to China and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China, and both China and France should abide by it. The French consul has ignored this, which is regrettable for the diplomatic relations between China and France. When the second agreement expires in the future, our government should pay attention to it. In the case of Kim Seok's arrest this time, the French consul did not make contact in advance, and the French Police Station did not know that he had been naturalized as a Chinese citizen (see the previous conversation between the French consul and the French Police Station with Lawyer Xu), resulting in an erroneous assistance. Considering the agreement, they should be held responsible, and after the family presented the nationality permit, the misunderstanding should have been clarified, and they should have been responsible for demanding the return, but they are still perfunctory. We may not be able to say that it is intentional, but it is suspected of being close to shirking responsibility. Therefore, although this matter is directly only a matter of Kim Seok's personal legal interests, the main focus is on the issue of our country's sovereignty and legal rights. Appeals from families and a small number of groups are minor and weak. It is hoped that the central authorities will rise up and fight for it.</p>
<h3 id="e178">There Is No Dual Nationality <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>According to Lawyer Xu, speaking to the Xin Sheng She reporter, Kim Seok has been naturalized as a Chinese citizen through legal procedures, and the Chinese government, in accordance with the Nationality Law, has also granted him Chinese nationality. The Japanese Consul General replied to the Municipal Government that Japanese law does not recognize Kim Seok as a Chinese citizen, but Chinese law has always confirmed that Kim Seok only has Chinese nationality and does not recognize the existence of his Japanese nationality or any nationality other than Chinese. The reporter asked about the solution to one person having dual nationality. Lawyer Xu replied that in international private law, the so-called one person having dual nationality does not mean that a country's law recognizes that he has its own nationality and also recognizes that he has foreign nationality, but it only means that comparing the nationality laws of the two countries, one person has two nationalities. Since Kim Seok has Chinese nationality, regardless of whether other countries recognize that he has other nationalities, according to Article 2 of the Chinese Law Application Regulations, "...but those who should be considered Chinese according to the Nationality Law, according to the provisions of Chinese law," even if Kim Seok is suspected of committing a crime, he should be tried under Chinese law. This solution is not only advocated by international private law scholars but is also the principle for resolving dual nationality conflicts. As for Japanese law still recognizing that Kim Seok has Japanese nationality, it is nothing more than because of the provisions of Article 24 of the Japanese Nationality Law: a man over the age of seventeen, even if there is a reason for losing his nationality, such as not being exempt from military service obligations, will still not be allowed to lose his Japanese nationality. However, the 1930 Hague International Law Codification Conference had a discussion room on dual nationality military service, and its first article stated, "A person with two or more nationalities, if his habitual residence is within the territory of one of the dependent countries, and is in fact most related to that country, may be exempt from military service in other dependent countries, and this exemption may be the reason for losing the nationality of other countries." Kim Seok has established residence in Chinese territory for many years, and in fact, he is of course related to China. Based on the principles of the Hague Convention, Kim Seok has of course been exempted from Japanese military service obligations and has lost his Japanese nationality and should be subject to Chinese law.</p>

<p>Registration Closes on the 27th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, entrusted by Changzhou gentry and merchants such as He Xiaohu, is organizing the Changzhou China National Goods Emporium. In addition to the Standing Committee member Chen Binghui and the General Secretary Xu Qiaoqi handling all design and implementation matters, they have also appointed staff members such as Xu Yao to go to Changzhou to prepare and decorate the emporium, and to expand publicity in the surrounding villages. As the scheduled opening date is approaching, the daily work is extremely busy. Various factories are enthusiastically registering to participate. However, limited by the emporium's regulations, only one company per industry is allowed, except for commonly used items, causing later-arriving factories in the same industry to feel regretful. According to the registration department's report yesterday, except for silk and satin and 28 other industries, all slots have been filled. There are still insufficient submissions in industries such as copperware, refined tin, tobacco cans, canned goods, seasonings, woolen cloth, copper utensils, stationery, raincoats, burglar alarms, rubber, and hardware. In addition to sending personnel to well-known factories to solicit participation, new and emerging handicrafts are also welcome to join. Factories interested in expanding sales in rural areas should not miss this excellent opportunity. It is also understood that the association has set the deadline for registration as the 27th of this month and will not extend it, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e181">National Goods Movement Conference Temporary Market Scheduled to Open <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The 30th of This Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Police District National Goods Movement Conference, organized by the China National Products Manufacturers Association, held its opening ceremony on the 15th of this month. The temporary market portion of the conference was originally scheduled to open on the 16th. However, the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council considered the construction of the market to be inadequate and advised the association to rebuild it. After receiving the letter, the association, considering that this project would be costly and that dismantling and rebuilding would cause significant losses to the various factories, convened an emergency meeting of manufacturers on the evening of the 15th. It was resolved to respect the Municipal Council's opinion and decided to dismantle and rebuild. Workers have been hired day and night to expedite construction. It is said that it can be completed by the 27th of this month. The association specially convened the fourth representatives' conference of participating manufacturers yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to discuss the opening date of the temporary market. It is understood that it has been decided to hold a lottery on the afternoon of the 28th of this month at 2:00 PM and to open on the 30th of this month, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Postal Associations Urge Implementation of the Postal Stabilization Plan <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The Postal Economic Crisis is Worsening Daily</p>
<p>Implementing the Postal Stabilization Plan is the Only Way to Save It</p>
<p>The postal associations proposed a plan to consolidate the postal base last year and held a large-scale postal promotion campaign. Through the mediation of various sectors of the city, a Postal Economic System Research Committee was established. After more than a year of effort by the committee, an implementation outline for the postal base consolidation plan was formulated in June of this year and submitted to the Executive Yuan, which instructed the Ministry of Transportation to implement it conscientiously. However, half a year has passed, and it has not yet been implemented, leading to a worsening postal economic crisis and the emergence of numerous dangers. Now, the Shanghai postal associations, concerned about the difficulties of the postal service, urgently hope that the plan will be implemented as soon as possible to save it. They sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Transportation yesterday to urge implementation. The content is recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Telegram to the Executive Yuan <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>To Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, Nanjing: We have learned that the Postal Economic System Research Committee passed the implementation outline for the postal base consolidation plan on June 15 of this year and suggested that Your Yuan adopt and implement it. However, more than half a year has passed since the committee concluded its work. During this time, news of the implementation has been repeatedly rumored, but in reality, there has been no progress whatsoever. When the staff recalled the committee's passage of the plan's implementation outline, they believed that our past efforts would not be in vain, and the eagerness for improvement filled the entire country. Unexpectedly, although the plan has been officially promulgated, it has not yet been implemented, and the public is extremely confused. The postal economic crisis is now imminent, and the only way to save it is to implement the postal base consolidation plan proposed by the committee. The staff is eager to save the postal service and hereby telegraphically request Your Excellency to promptly order the Ministry of Transportation to implement the postal base consolidation plan in accordance with the implementation outline passed by the Postal Economic System Research Committee and approved by Your Yuan to save the postal service and satisfy the public's expectations. The telegram is sent with the utmost urgency and anticipation. Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and Shanghai Postal Employees' Union, respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Submission to the Ministry of Transportation <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of submission: We have learned that the postal economy is exhausted, and the danger is now fully exposed. The most urgent task is to vigorously implement austerity measures, especially focusing on the big picture. In recent times, the postal authorities have also paid attention to this and have repeatedly implemented measures to reduce staff and streamline administration to demonstrate austerity. However, these austerity measures have failed to address the root causes, so the results have been minimal. Moreover, the postal economy has not only failed to recover but has become increasingly strained. The reason for this is the various expenses incurred by setting up separate bureaus for savings and remittances and the unlimited subsidies for airlines. If the Savings and Remittances Bureau can be merged immediately and the aviation subsidies stopped, the postal bureau can save enough each year to compensate for the losses of the past few years and restore the postal service to its former prosperity. This is a fundamental remedy for the exhaustion of the postal economy. We hereby submit to Your Ministry again, requesting that the merger of the Savings and Remittances Bureau and the cessation of aviation subsidies be implemented quickly so that the remedial effect can be realized. Furthermore, the recent dispatch of personnel by Your Ministry to Europe to inspect the postal services of various countries is very expensive and is not necessary for the current situation of the postal service. We have already telegraphed Your Ministry on this matter. We hereby submit to Your Ministry again, requesting that you give it careful consideration and promptly withdraw the order. The submission is made with the utmost respect and anticipation. Accompanying the submission.</p>

<p>Unclear Meaning, Mutual Hesitation</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Seamen's Union recently received an order from the General Union to reorganize the seamen on various ships. Therefore, the branch sent personnel to various ships to investigate and register, and the work is very busy. The Datong Shipping Company's Tongyang ship has a number of messboys who had not registered before. Therefore, when the ship returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday (21st), the Seamen's Union sent personnel to the company first and contacted Mr. Qian, the ship's affairs officer. Mr. Qian then jointly convened all the messboys to explain the Seamen's Union's intentions and encouraged them to register. However, the messboys were unclear about the meaning and hesitated to register, and eventually dispersed without registering. However, the Seamen's Union will continue to guide the messboys of the ship to register, it is said.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Railways Orders the Pinghan and Daokou Railways to Handle Accounts</p>
<p>The United Relief Association of Shanghai Charity Groups for the Yellow River Flood Disaster Relief recently raised 2,300 sets of new and old cotton clothing and relief medicine for the victims of the three counties in southern Hebei. It sent a letter to Kong Xiangxi, Chairman of the Yellow River Flood Disaster Relief Committee of the National Government, requesting him to forward it to the Ministry of Railways to telegraphically approve the request. Yesterday, the association received a reply. The original letter is excerpted below: "Regarding the case of your association's letter of December 7, which requested that 800 sets of new and old cotton clothing, packed in 40 packages, and a box of relief medicine be transported from Hankou to Daokou, and 1,500 sets of new and old cotton clothing, packed in 75 packages, and a box of relief medicine be transported from Huixian County to disaster victims, please forward it to the Ministry of Railways to order the relevant railway bureaus to transport them at half price on account. The committee immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, requesting approval to handle the case according to the precedent. Now, the ministry has replied by telegram, stating that the case has been distributed to the Pinghan and Daokou railways for preparation of transportation at half price on account. The corresponding letter is hereby sent for your information."</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Ministry of Finance Rejects the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Request to Reduce Factory Taxes <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Commercial Downturn is Due to the Impact of Economic Recession</p>
<p>Does Not Relate to the Unified Tax Rate</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously stated that excessive factory taxes hindered the promotion of national goods and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting approval to reduce factory taxes to reduce the cost of national goods. The Ministry of Finance has now replied as follows: "Received the submission. This case was previously submitted to the ministry by the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Commerce and has already been clearly instructed. It should be known that the unified tax rate for cotton yarn is only 2.75 yuan per 100 catties for undyed cotton yarn no more than 23 counts and 3.75 yuan per 100 catties for those exceeding 23 counts. Calculated at the current yarn price, it is about 4%, which cannot be considered too high. As for wheat flour, although a special tax of 10 cents is levied per bag, after deducting the subsidy, it is actually only 7 cents. Moreover, before the special tax was levied, wheat was subject to other taxes and levies. After the special tax on wheat flour was changed, the wheat tax was uniformly exempted, which avoids the abuses of overlapping and harsh levies along the way and is not considered to be an excessive tax rate. Also, the unified tax rate for matches has now been revised separately. Although the table has increased, the tax rate for sulfurized phosphorus matches is lighter than that for safety matches, which will not cause any difficulties in the future. Moreover, the unified tax is borne equally by both Chinese and foreign merchants. The manufacturers are only responsible for collecting and paying the tax, and the actual tax obligation is borne by the consumers. The claim that the business of various manufacturers is sluggish is due to the impact of the economic recession and has nothing to do with the unified tax rate. The request for a reduction is not approved. You should be informed of this." This reply.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Two Railway Lines' Train Arrival and Departure Regulations: Bell-Ringing Method <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>To be Implemented Starting New Year's Day</p>
<p>The Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Traffic Departments have now stipulated the bell-ringing method before the arrival and departure of trains at each station and will implement it from January 1 of the 23rd year (next year). Yesterday, a special notice was sent to the stationmasters and related personnel of the two railway lines, stating: "The bell-ringing method before the arrival and departure of trains at each station on the two railway lines has not been strictly regulated, causing the station staff to be unable to follow it and to ring the bell inconsistently. Ringing the bell is related to the service of passengers and staff. The Director of this office, in view of this, has specially formulated three articles for the bell-ringing method for each station on the two railway lines, which will be implemented from January 1 of the 23rd year. All previous bell-ringing methods at each station shall be abolished from the same date. A copy of the stipulated bell-ringing method is hereby sent to you for strict compliance." (1) Starting Departure Station: A. Passenger trains at the starting station two minutes before departure, ring the bell twice for up trains, and three times for down trains, five times, indicating that ticket sales have stopped. At the same time, those sending off passengers on the train must also disembark. (2) Terminal Station Arrival: A. After receiving the exit report of passenger trains, freight trains, or other trains from the neighboring station, ring the bell twice for up trains, and three times for down trains, ten times, and stop ringing. If stopped, ring continuously to indicate which track the train should enter. The number of rings should be the same as the number of the track. (The stationmaster and switchman must still exchange hand signals as required.) B. When passenger trains arrive at the two terminal stations of Shanghai and Nanjing, the bell ringers should be handled by the Shanghai and Nanjing flag wavers. (3) En Route Stop and Non-Stop Stations: A. After receiving the exit report of passenger trains, freight trains, or other trains from the neighboring station, regardless of whether the train is scheduled to stop at the station or not, or is stopping for a meeting, ring the bell twice for up trains, and three times for down trains, ten times, and stop ringing. After a short pause, ring continuously to indicate which track the train should enter. The number of rings should be the same as the number of the track. (The stationmaster and switchman must still exchange hand signals as required.) B. Two minutes before the departure of passenger trains between Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Changan, Hangzhou, and Yuyao stations (according to the scheduled time for each train to enter the station, according to the actual time), ring the bell twice for up trains, and three times for down trains, three times, indicating that ticket sales have stopped. At the same time, those sending off passengers on the train must also disembark. C. When passenger trains arrive at other stations within the station outside of Station B, ring the bell twice for up trains, and three times for down trains, three times, indicating that ticket sales have stopped. If the train needs to remain at the station to wait for a meeting or there are other special circumstances, then extend the ticket sales time.</p>

<p>Wei Tingrong, the current Chinese director of the French Concession Labor Bureau, was previously accused of inciting kidnappers to falsely accuse Zhao Weixian of kidnapping. The Garrison Headquarters investigated and declared him innocent. Zhao then filed a counterclaim in court, accusing Wei Tingrong of inciting false accusations, and filed a private prosecution with the Second Special District Court. The Second Special District Court has already held a preliminary hearing. At that time, the police lawyer requested to participate. According to the agreement, police lawyers are not allowed to participate in private prosecution cases, so the judge submitted a request to the higher court for an interpretation. It is understood that the case is scheduled to resume hearing at 2:00 PM on the 26th of this month at the Second Special District Court, it is said.</p>

<p>Hotel Ledger to be Obtained, Rehearing to be Held</p>
<p>Zhang Yizhen, the biological daughter of Zhang Hanchun, a resident of No. 14, Longqing Lane, Ningbo Road, Public Concession, from Dongting Mountain, Wuxian County, is 20 years old this year. On July 14 and September 14 of last year, she was twice enticed by Ye Shaoyun, a fellow villager and relative (24 years old this year, working in the Xiangtai Lumber Company), using fraudulent means, and taken to the Yuetong Second Hotel, No. 85, Fuxing Lane, Yong'an Street, French Concession, where they had illicit intercourse, resulting in an unwanted pregnancy. In April of this year, Yizhen was married to He Kangqu by her parents' arrangement. However, she gave birth to a child only two months after the marriage. Her husband's family considered her unchaste and sent Yizhen back to her parents' home. After her parents learned of the previous events, they hired lawyer Song Mingdong to file a complaint with the Second Special District Court, accusing Ye Shaoyun of enticing a woman under the age of 20 and seeking compensation of 6,000 yuan in civil damages. The court has already held a hearing, and the details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, the court summoned witnesses Zhu Xiaofeng and Shen Tong, who stated that after the incident, they went to the Yuetong Hotel to investigate and found that a Mr. Ye brought a woman to open a room on July 14 of last year, as recorded in the ledger. On September 14, a Mr. Ye brought a woman to open a room at the hotel again, as recorded in the ledger. The aunt of the defendant Ye Shaoyun, Wang Jiangshi, stated, "The defendant is my nephew, and the daughter of the plaintiff, Yizhen, is my niece. They are all relatives. Yizhen gave birth only two months after marriage and was sent back to her mother's home by her husband's family. At this point, the woman learned that there was an improper relationship between her nephew Ye Shaoyun and Yizhen. I inquired with my nephew Ye Shaoyun at my relatives' house in Guangyu Lane, asking if there was such a thing, and scolded him. According to Ye, 'I can deal with Miss's affairs directly with her. It's none of your business,' etc. I don't know anything else. However, in April or May of last year, Ye Shaoyun invited me and Zhang Yizhen to see a movie." At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer Song stated, "Wang Liangchu, the husband of the witness Wang Jiangshi, recently sent a letter to the plaintiff, stating that Ye Shaoyun sent a letter to his aunt and uncle, instructing them not to testify in court, otherwise Ye's mother would definitely die in Wang's home," etc. According to Wang's letter, the defendant relied on the omnipotence of money, and this injustice was difficult to redress, etc. The original letter was submitted. After Judge Wu Fangyuan examined it, he instructed that the hearing be postponed until the hotel ledger was obtained and the case of illicit intercourse was reviewed. The court then adjourned.</p>

<p>On Rue Wagner, French Concession, a fire broke out at 6:30 AM on the 21st in a bungalow at No. 14, Lane 168, accidentally spreading to eight or nine neighboring houses. An elderly Suzhou woman, Jin Taoshi, 61 years old, who made a living selling flowers on the mezzanine of No. 14, forgot to take her savings of 80 yuan in silver and 30,000 copper coins when she fled and re-entered to retrieve them, resulting in her inability to escape. She died in the fire. After the fire brigade arrived and extinguished the fire, the body was dug out, completely charred beyond recognition. The police sent the body in a hearse to the autopsy room and reported it to the court for examination. He Shaorong, a Suzhou native, and Xu Jinbao, a Ningbo native, who lived with the woman, were taken to the police station to investigate the cause of the fire. The two families denied each other, and the details have been reported in the newspapers. The detective Cai Jinzhang, dispatched by the police chief, conducted a thorough investigation and concluded that the disaster was indeed caused by an overturned kerosene lamp in He Shaorong's room, resulting in the tragic disaster. He was arrested, and he admitted his negligence. A kerosene lamp and a stool were found at the scene of the fire. Yesterday, He was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated that the police investigation of the case had not been completed and requested a postponement. He requested that the defendant be detained temporarily and that a prosecution be filed after a detailed investigation. The evidence was presented to the court. Judge Li Changnian briefly questioned He Shaorong and then instructed that the hearing be postponed to the 28th after the investigation was completed. The defendant was returned to custody pending further instructions. As for the burned elderly woman, Jin Taoshi, the court examination confirmed that her son, A Hu, was in the countryside. After being urged to come to Shanghai, he also had no money and borrowed money to buy a coffin and bury her.</p>

While the robbers were fleeing after the public robbery, they were secretly followed by an employee of the victim's family, all the way to Avenue Foch near Rue Auguste Villeret. The employee reported to the Chinese and Vietnamese police. As the police were about to move forward to arrest them, the robbers noticed and first opened fire to resist arrest. As a result, they still escaped. Stray bullets killed a rickshaw puller and seriously injured a woman in the rickshaw. The details are recorded below.</p>

<p>No. 19, Nanshan Lane, Rue de Montauban, Rue Massenet, French Concession, is an old-fashioned bungalow, six large rooms facing north and south, with a large courtyard in the middle. Because the house is located at the end of the lane, it is extremely quiet. Chen Yicheng, a native of Pudong, established a milk shop there several years ago, named Kangti Milk Shop, with 19 Chinese and Western cows. It has more than 100 regular customers. The business has been quite prosperous. Chen, due to other business, handed over the shop to Jin Axi (also known as Jin Asan), a native of Luodian, to manage. In addition to the three rooms at the south end, which were converted into a cow shed, Jin's family lived in the three bungalows on the north side.</p>

<p>At about 5:40 PM last night, Jin had just finished his work and returned home. He had just entered the bedroom, taken off his coat, and was talking to his relative, Wu, when suddenly five robbers burst in from the main gate. Three robbers were armed with pistols, and two robbers entered the bedroom directly, prohibiting them from making any noise. One robber immediately snatched a pair of gold earrings from Wu's ears and a gold ring from his left hand. Another robber searched Jin's body and stole 26 yuan in cash. The robbers, seeing that there was nothing else of value, fled out the door.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Four Police Officers Hear the News and Pursue <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>During the public robbery, a milk delivery employee of Jin, named Du Gendi, was very quick-witted. He hid in the corner of the room, quietly observing the situation. When he saw the robbers leave the door and flee, he secretly followed them, step by step, all the way to Avenue Foch near Rue Auguste Villeret, and urgently reported it to Vietnamese police officer No. 320 and No. 286, and Chinese police officers No. 471 and No. 467. The four police officers heard the news and rushed to intercept them.</p>

<p>As the four police officers were about to move forward, two of the robbers had already noticed and pulled out their guns to fire. The Vietnamese police officers also fired back with their rifles. However, that place was a thoroughfare between the Chinese and French territories, with heavy traffic and even more dense pedestrians. In a flash, they disappeared into the crowd and escaped without a trace. A Jiangyin woman, Zhu Leishi, 33 years old, who lived at No. 20, Runan Lane, Ximen Road, happened to be riding in a rickshaw to the home of her relative, Jin Yunlong, at No. 26, Tongkang Lane, Avenue Foch. Unexpectedly, she suffered as an innocent bystander.</p>

<p>When the two sides exchanged fire, a bullet happened to hit the chest of a rickshaw puller, piercing a hole through it, and reaching Madam Zhu Lei's buttocks. The rickshaw puller fell to the ground in response, and Madam Lei also fell from the rickshaw. Amidst the chaos, the French police had already heard the alarm and dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to encircle and capture [the shooters]. Seeing the rickshaw puller and Madam Lei lying at the doorway of Pan Changxing rickshaw shop at No. 324, they used a vehicle to send the rickshaw puller to the Jin Shenfu Road Guangci Hospital, and Madam Lei to Renji Hospital.</p>

<p>The rickshaw puller was sent to the hospital, but because the wound was in a vital area, he soon died. The police inspected the rickshaw, noting the numbers as 12161 in the French Concession and 632 in the Chinese area. They immediately notified the Rickshaw Office to determine the owner of the rickshaw, so that the surname of the deceased could be known. Meanwhile, the police notified the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home to transport the body to the coroner's office, pending a report to the Second Special District Court for examination.</p>
<h3 id="e203">The Police Officially Accuse Chang Yuting of False Accusation <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Yuqing's Concubine is Very Concerned</p>
<p>Yesterday She Even Went to Court to Observe</p>
<p>The traitor Chang Yuqing, since the cessation of hostilities in the Shanghai Incident, was wanted by the authorities and could not stand his ground in Shanghai. He fled to Dalian, seeking refuge under the protection of the Japanese, and entrusted his family in Shanghai to the care of his younger brother Yuting. He also delegated his various duties to Yuting. Unexpectedly, Yuting's intentions were even more base and vile than his brother's. He seized his brother's property and also committed adultery with his brother's concubine. Recently, his sister-in-law found out and became estranged from him. Yuting suspected that his son-in-law Zhang Xingran and Luo Guangqi, a worker at the Daguan Garden bathhouse, were stirring things up. He fabricated a threatening letter, falsely accusing Zhang and Luo of plotting to extort 20,000 gold [coins] from him. He reported this to the police, who arrested Zhang and Luo and brought them to the First Special District Court. After questioning and clarifying the reason for Yuting's frame-up, the court ruled Zhang and Luo innocent. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that after the verdict, the police, considering that Chang Yuting dared to set a trap to harm people, which is not tolerated by the law, immediately took him into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court, where the Shanghai Municipal Council's representative lawyer, Wang Yaotang, filed a public prosecution against Yuting for the crime of false accusation under Article 180 of the Criminal Law, and summoned Zhang Xingran and Luo Guangqi to testify. Yuqing's beloved concubine, whom Yuting had seduced and taken as his own, was very concerned that her lover had become the defendant, so she also went to court to observe. Judge Xue then interrogated the defendant Chang Yuting, but Chang firmly denied fabricating the threatening letter and hired a lawyer to defend him, arguing that the police's verification of the handwriting was not convincing and that another expert should be selected to re-examine the letter. The police lawyer argued that the police's handwriting verification was extremely accurate. After debating with the opposing side, Judge Xue ordered a postponement for further hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Continued Hearing Yesterday in the Zheng Tangsheng Kidnapping Case <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Locals Zheng Tangsheng, Shang Zhen from Henan, and Liu Yimin and Li Shaoting from Yangzhou, along with accomplices who are still at large and Geng Huatang from Shandong, who died by hanging, kidnapped five people in Shanghai between the winter of 1930 and February of last year: Huang Yuyi, Chen Yanghe, He Shaoting, Gu Zelin, and Huang Baohua. They demanded huge ransoms for their release. They also strangled a fellow gang member, Xiao Shaoxing. In Tianjin, they kidnapped Chen Zhuling and Liang Huiwu, former compradors of Jardine Matheson, but failed to collect the ransom and killed them, burying their bodies to eliminate the evidence. Jin Jiulin, the chief inspector of the special unit of the French police, learned in July of this year that Zheng and the other bandits were hiding in Tianjin. He dispatched detective Zhang Ziying, deputy detectives Qian Yumin and Zhou Bingcheng, and other detectives to Tianjin, arrested Zheng, Shang, Liu, Li, and Geng, and escorted them back to Shanghai. They were handed over to the Second Special District Court for public prosecution. During the trial, Geng Huatang committed suicide in the police station's detention center out of fear of punishment. Zheng and Shang, who were in custody, heard the news of Geng's suicide and also desperately attempted to hang themselves at the same time, but they were discovered and rescued by the guards. After the trial concluded, Zheng, Shang, Liu, and Li were found guilty of repeated offenses of aiding in kidnapping for ransom and were sentenced to death, pending approval by the provincial government. Zheng and the others refused to accept this verdict and submitted a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting a retrial to clear their names. The provincial government approved the request and returned the case to the Second Special District Court. Wang Gangxu, the chief judge of the criminal court, opened the trial on the 8th of this month. All four defendants overturned their previous confessions and denied participating in the kidnappings. The judge noted that key witnesses, including the kidnapped victims and the police detectives who handled the case, had not been summoned for questioning, and ordered a postponement for further hearing. These details were reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, the adjourned hearing took place. The defense attorneys hired by the defendants – Zhu Fojiu, Zhu Dianqing, Fan Gang, and Qian Shusheng – arrived at the court on time to await instructions. The police detectives Zhang Ziying, Qian Yumin, Zhou Bingcheng, and detectives Qin Youyu and Cui Zhenguo also reported their arrival to await questioning. However, the victims Chen Yanghe, Gu Zizhen, and Huang Baohua did not appear; only Huang Yuyi and He Shaoting sent their bodyguards, Ma Pingan, and chauffeur, Yu Yonghuai, as representatives. At 3:45 PM, Judge Wang, accompanied by clerk Ren, took his seat in the Second Criminal Court for the hearing. Lawyers Yao Zhaodi and Gu Shouxi appeared in court on behalf of the police. The judge ordered the bailiffs to bring the four defendants – Zheng, Shang, Liu, and Li – from the detention center for questioning. After a brief questioning, the judge called witness Ma Pingan to the stand, first ordering him to take an oath. Ma testified that he had been Huang Yuyi's bodyguard for five years. He said his master was in Xiamen, so he was sent as a representative today. On the day Huang was kidnapped, he was returning home in a car when a free car followed them. At the intersection of Avenue Foch and Great Western Road, the free car sped up and cut in front of them, blocking the road. Their car had to slow down. The kidnappers then came up. He and another bodyguard, surnamed Wu, got out of the car and opened fire to resist. Wu was shot dead, and he was wounded in his right palm and left leg. Because he had used all five bullets he carried, he was unable to do anything. His master was then kidnapped. The kidnappers had two pistols. They fired first, trying to kill them. The kidnappers fired more than thirty shots. He said he could still remember the faces of two of the kidnappers. The judge ordered him to identify whether any of the four defendants present were at the scene. Ma turned around and carefully examined Zheng and the others for a long time, and replied that he could not recognize any of them. While testifying, he also demonstrated how he resisted at the time. Then, Yu Yonghuai was called to the stand and ordered to take an oath. He was questioned about the kidnapping of He Shaoting. He testified that he had been He's driver for four or five years. At 9:45 AM on August 30 of last year, his master was in the car, and he was driving from Rue Cardinal Mercier eastward. When they reached the intersection of Route Doumer and wanted to turn, the car slowed down. At that time, two kidnappers rushed up, one wearing a long gown who took the wheel, and one wearing a Xiangyunsha shirt and pants who pressed him down. He was shot in the back with a pistol. Because he was terrified, he couldn't see the faces of the kidnappers. Several other kidnappers came up from behind, but he didn't know who they were. His master was then kidnapped. He said his master had been in Beiping for a long time, so he was sent as a representative today to testify. Then, detective Zhang Ziying was called to the stand and questioned about the case investigation. The judge said further investigation was needed and ordered a postponement for another hearing. The defendants were returned to the detention center.</p>

<p>Lu Yimin, who claims to be a lawyer, organized the "Minquan Law Office" on Route Remi in the International Settlement, undertaking litigation and non-litigation matters. Recently, in a rental dispute between Qiao Fangxi and Zhao Weijiang, Lu Yimin sent a letter to lawyer Zhou Yingjie. After receiving the letter, Zhou Yingjie found that the letterhead bore the titles "Former Envoy of Pacification for the Army and Navy of Guangdong Public Mansion," "Former Acting President of the Supreme Court of the Provisional Government," "Former Pacification Envoy for Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi of the National Revolutionary Army," and "Doctor of Law, Attorney Lu Yimin." He checked the membership directory of the Shanghai Bar Association and found no Lu Yimin. He also inquired with the association, which confirmed that no such person existed. Lawyer Zhou believed that Lu was impersonating a lawyer and sent a letter to the standing committee of the Shanghai Bar Association, requesting them to investigate. After confirming the matter, they submitted a document to the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai First Special District Court, requesting an investigation and prosecution. After reviewing the document, the court has ordered the relevant police station to summon Lu for investigation and verification.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Inspector Zhang Shouts Down "Third Madam" <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Wu, a Spiritual Medium, Brings Trouble</p>
<p>Zhao Wu, a female spiritual medium, is 44 years old and originally from Shanghai. She lives at No. 120 Dong Street, inside Xiaodongmen in Nanshi. Recently, she had another imaginative idea, setting up a private altar at home and claiming to be possessed by the "Third Madam," the wife of the "Third Lord" from Mount Shangfang. She specialized in interpreting incense sticks, treating illnesses, and predicting good and bad fortune for others. She also used incense ash as a fake elixir to collect money, and secretly had people spread rumors that the "Third Madam" had saved many poor people, cured many sick people, and that those who played the lottery and wanted to know which door would open that day could also go to make a vow and draw a lot, and that everything would be answered and unbelievably effective. As a result, many ignorant men and women and lottery gamblers flocked to her. Therefore, her daily income was very large. However, yesterday, Patrol Inspector Zhang Panchi of the Second Precinct of the First District heard about this and, believing that she was using superstitious talk to mislead the public and extort money, violating the ban, rushed to her address around noon and arrested her. He brought her and the bamboo sticks used for drawing lots back to the station, where Police Chief Liu conducted a preliminary interrogation and ordered her detention pending investigation. Unexpectedly, after Zhao Wu was detained in the detention center, she suddenly started hissing and shut her eyes tightly, flailing her arms and legs, claiming that the Third Madam had descended. "You arrested me here, let me tell you, you can't scare me away," she said, putting on an act and making ugly faces, trying to convince the station that the Third Madam was not fake and they wouldn't dare to make things difficult for her. When Inspector Zhang saw this, he was furious and stepped forward and shouted at her. The woman immediately opened her eyes and was as still as a wooden chicken. Inspector Zhang then jokingly said, "You said the Third Madam was bold and couldn't be scared away, so why did she return to her Shangfang Mountain as soon as I shouted?" At this point, the woman knew her tricks had failed, lowered her head, and said nothing. Inspector Zhang laughed it off.</p>

<p>More Than Ten Houses Burned Down, Affecting More Than Thirty Families</p>
<p>Four People Injured Jumping from Windows to Escape</p>
<p>Xu Zhang, a resident of No. 17 Beiwang Yima Alley inside Xinbeimen, rented a room to Xu Daqian (54 years old) from Changzhou. Yesterday morning at 7:30 AM, Xu was careless with fire, and within moments, clouds of smoke filled the air and broke through the roof. The nearby patrol police learned of the fire and immediately notified the fire brigades of each district, which quickly rushed to the scene with pump trucks to extinguish the fire. It took about two hours to extinguish the fire. In addition to the complete destruction of the house and belongings of No. 17, the fire also spread to the houses at No. 19 and No. 21, affecting a total of more than ten houses and thirty families, causing considerable damage.

<p>At about 1:15 AM yesterday, three thieves came to the home of Huang Kengting, from Yancheng, who rents out rickshaws for a living, at No. 2 Tiejiang Lane, Route Ghisi, Caojiadu, West Shanghai. Pretending to pay rickshaw rent, they knocked on the door and shouted loudly. Huang's wife believed them and woke up from her dream to open the door. The three thieves, one with a pistol and one with a sharp knife, rushed in and ordered her to remain silent. They immediately turned over chests and boxes, looting a gold bracelet, a gold ring, a pair of gold earrings, and 100 small silver coins, for a total loss of more than 300 yuan. As the thieves were escaping with the stolen goods, the victim discovered that the pistol held by one of the thieves was fake. He then boldly gave chase, shouting for the capture of the thieves. At that time, the neighbors heard the alarm and rushed out to help capture them, but the thieves had already fled far away without a trace. The victim then wrote a report and submitted it to the nearby Sixth District Police Station, requesting the pursuit, arrest, and investigation of the thieves and stolen goods.</p>

<p>A woman from Gaoyou, Xie Wan's daughter, Xiao Gui Zi, residing at 957 Dong You Heng Road, is 23 years old and possesses some beauty. She has been living with You Da Jin, a fellow villager residing at No. 10 Kunshan Garden, Kunshan Road, for four years and has a daughter named Xiao Hong Zi, who is only two years old and whom she cherishes dearly. Xie Wan's monthly living expenses were provided by You. Recently, due to You's income being insufficient to cover expenses, this payment has been discontinued. Xie has repeatedly negotiated, but payment has been delayed. Xie became greatly angered and, at around 3 PM on the afternoon of the previous day, gathered several people and went to You's house to reason with him. You happened to be out. Xie then forcibly took her daughter, Xiao Gui Zi, and her granddaughter, Xiao Hong Zi, and fled, disappearing without a trace. Upon You's return, after learning of the situation, he went to Xie's house on Dong You Heng Road to make a scene, demanding the return of Xiao Gui Zi and her daughter. Xie also spoke rudely, and they quarreled with each other. Neighbors gathered in large numbers. An investigator from the Huishan Patrol Station passed by, inquired about the situation, and took Xie Wan to the patrol station. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The patrol station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, explained the situation and requested an extension for further investigation. Subsequently, Xie Xiao Gui Zi claimed that the defendant was her mother. At the time, her mother brought several people to the house, and her daughter Hong Zi was taken away by an unknown person, Mr. Jia. She herself was dragged to the South Railway Station and took the opportunity to slip away. She does not know where Xiao Hong Zi is now. When questioned, Xie Wan claimed that Xiao Hong Zi was actually taken away and hidden by the Wan family, the family of Xiao Gui Zi's former fiancé, and had nothing to do with her. She asked for consideration. Judge Wu Zehan ordered that the woman be temporarily detained in her current location and rescheduled the hearing to clarify the facts.</p>

<p>Xing Zhigang, representative of the shipping companies of Pudong West, requested the dredging of the shoals along the Pu River south of Wharf No. 16 to maintain navigation and revitalize commerce. The Shanghai Municipal Government has approved it, stating: "Received the submission. After instructing the Bureau of Public Works and the Bureau of Public Utilities to jointly submit a report, it was found that the dredging of the shoals along the Pu River has always been planned by the Dredging Bureau. After the Bureau of Public Works inquired with the Dredging Bureau, it received a reply that the shoal section had been dredged between 1931 and 1932 and would not need to be dredged again until around 1935. The current proposal for dredging cannot be approved. However, it was stated that if one or two wharves in that section need to be repaired, a clamshell dredger could be dispatched to work for about a week. Based on the previous order, we jointly submitted a report for your review." According to this, in addition to the instruction, it is appropriate to approve and inform. It is heard that the representative is requesting the Bureau of Public Works to dredge the shallowest areas of the Nanhui Guan and the Gongyi Shipping Company wharves to facilitate navigation.</p>
<h3 id="e226">The Precursor to the Northwest Trading Company <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>The Northwest Trading Company was initiated by a current director of a Gansu province department, and since its preparation was undertaken by former Senator Zhao Shiyu, he has spared no effort. Prominent figures in Shanghai, such as Wang Rutang, Xue Dubi, Chen Zhishuo, and Zhang Xinwu, are said to have been invited to join as promoters, demonstrating the Chinese people's determination to develop the Northwest. Recently, various authorities in the Northwest, in order to facilitate the company's progress, telegraphed Zhao and others to go to Long to personally discuss plans. To clarify the content of the company to all sectors, the origin is now revealed as follows: "Establishing a nation globally, national systems differ, policies vary with time, but the ultimate goal is national prosperity and benefit for the people. This is universally acknowledged by those who discuss politics and national theory. National prosperity is based on the people's benefit. In ancient times, it was called 'promoting well-being and utilizing resources'; today, it is called 'social economy,' both focusing on the people's livelihood as the top priority. The principle of people's livelihood varies with the degree of a nation's economic progress. At a minimum, it must ensure adequate food and clothing, preventing hunger and cold, so that social order can be maintained and national turmoil can be avoided. There is a way to ensure the people's livelihood: benefiting from the natural resources also depends on human effort. Trading cloth for silk, exchanging grain for machinery, was the case in ancient times. With the world open and the market expanded, the economic state has also progressed from simple to complex. Chinese economy has suffered direct and indirect exploitation by imperialists. Raw materials are sold cheaply, finished goods are bought at high prices, leading to rural bankruptcy and increasing people's hardship. The Southeast, with convenient transportation, has gradually reformed this problem. The Northwest, located in remote areas, often has its raw materials remain unutilized, such as wool, leather, cotton, and other important industrial raw materials. Due to the lack of transportation and sales organizations, foreign merchants and compradores manipulate and buy them at low prices, while daily necessities require high prices. Thus, on one hand, some are rich and corrupt, while on the other hand, some cry from hunger and cold. Production and sales are out of sync, and supply and demand are not met. This is a concern for society and people's livelihood, and it is what those who advocate developing the Northwest should urgently plan for. Recognizing this, we have initiated a Northwest Trading Company to adjust production and sales, meeting supply and demand, so that the raw materials produced in the Northwest provinces can be transported and sold to areas where manufacturing industries need them at fair prices. In return, it will transport and sell goods for daily use to the Northwest provinces at fair prices, to prevent the monopoly of foreign merchants and compradores, to meet the urgent needs of the people's daily life. Farmers, industrialists, and merchants will all benefit, and tax revenue agencies will also increase legitimate income, reducing excessive levies, alleviating people's hardship. However, creation is difficult and relies on the strength of the group. We respectfully present a general overview and hope that all national elites, those who are committed to developing the Northwest and alleviating the people's livelihood, will step forward to guide us. We would be most grateful."</p>

<h3 id="e231">Biscuit Guild Discusses Unwarranted Fine Case <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Requests All Organizations to Unanimously Assist in Negotiations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Biscuit and Confectionery Guild convened its 23rd joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members yesterday. Zhang Yichen was elected chairman. A member of the Dehua Biscuit Company reported that a receipt for 88 cents had a one-cent stamp affixed to it, but the Committee for the Trial of Cases Violating the Stamp Tax Regulations fined them five yuan, which was enforced by the Second District Public Security Bureau, without allowing any opportunity for defense. The guild's representative sent a letter requesting withdrawal, but was told that the fine had already been enforced and paid and transferred to the Public Security Bureau, so the request could not be processed. After discussion, it was unanimously felt that the Committee's trial of cases was hasty, based on emotions, and abused the power to fine. The inspectors sought to gain merit and reward, and the superiors and subordinates conspired to harm the merchants. If the merchants remain silent in pain, the consequences will be dire. The guild, having purported to try cases violating the Stamp Tax Regulations, cannot dismiss the matter with a few words because the fine was small, had already been enforced, and could not be processed. For example, someone charged with a crime is allowed to appeal and request a retrial. It has never been heard of that a case, once discussed in a chamber, becomes an ironclad case. Therefore, it is imperative to request that the fine be refunded. In another case, the Committee deemed the account notification of the Taichang Company to be a disguised invoice, falsely accusing them of taking advantage of loopholes, and fined them 20 yuan. In fact, according to commercial practice, it was a simple notification with no relation to payments. However, the Stamp Committee considered it to have the nature of monetary receipts and payments, deemed the failure to affix a stamp a violation, and punished them accordingly. According to the facts, if this is punishable, then bank and money shop statements, and lawyers' warnings for overdue payments, have the same meaning and function, and have never been heard of being punished. Why be lenient to them and harsh to us? In summary, there are countless cases of being fined for not deserving punishment due to stamp duty issues. It was unanimously believed that this kind of event is a common problem for the entire business community, not just the Dehua and Taichang companies suffering. All merchants should express their opinion. It is proposed to send a letter to all industry guilds and district citizens' associations in the city, submitting the matter for discussion, jointly seeking a solution to alleviate the pain, and unanimously supporting the companies.</p>

<p>Will Be Disposed of According to Law If Not Claimed by Deadline</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Chief, Wen Hongen, sent a letter to this newspaper stating: "According to the report from the Third Branch of the Fifth District, 'On November 19th, it was reported that a number of Japanese and Korean people were seen entering and exiting No. 14 Qingyangli, Yangjiahang Road, acting suspiciously. Patrol Officer Wang Youheng was dispatched to handle the matter. Subsequently, it was reported that he, along with Police Inspector Yamashiro and Officer Ozawa from the Japanese Consular Police Station, went to the residence on the same day. A young man came out to meet them, stating, "I live in the attic. The owner is currently not here and will return around 6 PM. My name is Li Shuishan, and I am 21 years old." At 6:30 PM, they went to the residence again with personnel from the Japanese Consulate and discovered various drugs and equipment for manufacturing heroin on the third floor. The items in the room were all Japanese daily necessities. No one was found in the residence. A report was submitted for review.' We immediately ordered them to verify the furniture and other items with personnel from the Japanese Consulate, compile a list, and have Yamashiro Zenpei from the Japanese Consular Police Station come to verify the list in detail the next day. Both parties signed and sealed the list, each keeping a copy as proof. The identity of the residence's tenant, Lin Rongchang, whether Japanese or Korean, could not be determined. However, Li Shuishan, whom they glimpsed on the 19th, was confirmed to be Korean. Lin Rongchang had secretly moved into No. 14 Qingyangli in October of this year without reporting to the Household Registration Office of this station, secretly setting up a drug manufacturing facility in the house. An investigation was conducted for several days before it was cracked. Lin Rongchang and Li Shuishan have both reportedly fled. We are submitting the heroin manufacturing equipment, drugs, furniture, and other items, along with the list, for your review and instructions.' Furniture, drugs, a motor, a list, and other items have been submitted to the bureau. We have written to the Japanese Consulate General for verification, but it is still unclear whether the drug manufacturing facility was established by Japanese residents. In view of this, after investigating the items seized in this case, the owner's name and address are repeatedly unconfirmed. In addition to various drugs and equipment used for committing crimes, there are also various furniture and clothing items. It is urgent to issue a public notice to claim them, in order to show fairness. In addition to issuing a public notice and sending a letter to the Japanese Consulate General to forward the notice to the owner, we are setting a deadline of six months from December 20th of this year for them to come to the bureau to identify and claim the items. If no one claims the items by the deadline, the bureau will dispose of the aforementioned furniture and other evidence in accordance with the law. We hereby inform you to investigate and refer to this notice and hope that you will publish it in the news section so that the owner can be informed and come to the bureau to claim the items by the deadline." Sincerely, Shanghai Newspaper Office.</p>

<p>To the Editor: Having read the article "Resolution of the Water Outage Case in Tonghai Lane" in your newspaper yesterday, I found that the description of the process was quite erroneous. After the water outage incident in this lane occurred, all the tenants jointly elected Liu Zhenbo, Tang Fengming, Chen Shirong, and Chen Wenyun to petition the Public Works Department for assistance. At that time, the owner did not go along with them. Until 2:00 PM, the Public Works Department had not yet come to open the Taiping faucet. The residents, having been without water for many days, were in imminent danger. They had no choice but to automatically open the Taiping faucet in the lane to alleviate the emergency. At that time, the owner sent a representative, Mr. Yao, to participate in the water outage meeting and agreed to write to the water company to send someone to open the water pipes for the residents. The facts of the matter are as described above. The news published yesterday was issued by the Xinsheng News Agency, but the agency did not come to investigate, resulting in a misrepresentation. I hope you will make a correction. Sincerely, Representatives of the Tenants of Tonghai Lane, Liu Zhenbo, Tang Fengming, Chen Shirong, Chen Wenyun.</p>

<p>— Jianfen</p>
<p>Friends: When you "study" at school, do you feel that "singing"! (or the subjects you understand)! is very interesting, while "arithmetic"! (or the subjects you don't understand)! is tasteless? The reason is very obvious, it's because of "understanding" and "not understanding." Because the rhythm of "singing" is clear, it feels interesting to sing; the truth of "arithmetic" is not understood, so it's tasteless to do. If this is indeed the case for you, then I now have a way to make "arithmetic"! (or the subjects you don't understand)! as interesting as "singing"! (or the subjects you understand)! That is, when the teacher is lecturing, when dissecting the truth, you have to "listen carefully." If there is anything you don't understand, you can raise it and "ask" until you "understand." Don't abandon it just because it's tasteless. You must know that the Englishman Watt himself studied the use of "steam" and invented the "steam engine"; how can we, now having teachers guiding us in "lessons," fail to understand the truth and find it tasteless?</p>

<p>— Shouwu</p>
<p>Sparta was a country with a martial spirit. The people were very strong. Because there was a wise royal family member named Li Kouergusi, he made many rules to train the people.</p>
<p>When a baby was first born, his father had to wrap him in a robe and send him to the council, where many old and wise people would examine him. If he was strong and had no physical disabilities, he would be returned to the father to be raised; otherwise, he would be abandoned in the mountains.</p>
<p>When children reached the age of seven, they left their parents and were taken care of by people selected by the state. The books they read were all stories of heroes and wars. All year round, from morning to night, they were only allowed to wear a single garment of coarse wool. They slept without a bed, on a pile of reeds. In winter, they were only allowed to add a layer of cattail fluff.</p>

<p>— Wang Zhong</p>
<p>There was a farmer who was cultivating a large field. The rice was about to dry up because there was no rain. The farmer was very worried, looking at the sky every day, wondering if it would rain.</p>
<p>At this time, a little rain in the sky saw him and said, "Ah! Poor farmer, you have used so much effort, and the rice is about to dry up. I want to help you with a little rain." Another little rain said, "How can you, with your little rain, nourish such a large field?" The first little rain said, "Yes, but when I go down, at least I can comfort him." The second little rain saw the first little rain falling and landing right on the farmer's head. He also immediately went down, saying, "Let me also nourish his rice."</p>
<p>At this time, a large group of rain came running and said, "You are doing such a good thing, we want to do it too."</p>
<p>After a rain, the rice in the field ripened. It was all because of a little bit of rain wanting to do its best.</p>

<p>— Mai Ying</p>
<p>The sun had set, and Precious Sister stood at the door of her house, waiting for her older sister to return from work. Several large trees across the street were to be cut down, as they obscured the road in front, preventing her from seeing her older sister sooner.</p>
<p>Her older sister emerged from the woods, and Precious Sister ran up to her. Calling out "Older Sister," she took the older sister's lunch basket into her own hands. She opened the basket lid to see if there was any leftover rice and vegetables.</p>
<p>She told her older sister: Mother's illness has not improved, and Father has gone to Mr. Xu's house to borrow rice. Her older sister said nothing, just sighed.</p>
<p>Her older sister's face was much thinner. She said to her sister: Older sister, I am stronger now, and I can carry half a bucket of river water and run back. Tomorrow, you can rest at home, and I will go to work in your place. Her older sister said nothing, just smiled bitterly.</p>

<p>▲Naughty Children and Frogs</p>
<p>A group of naughty children were playing by a small pond. Suddenly, they saw several frogs in the pond. They picked up small stones by the pond. When the frogs' heads came out of the water, they all threw stones at them, clapping and laughing when they hit.</p>
<p>"Children," said a frog, "this is not a game. Although you are looking for fun, we are in mortal danger."</p>
<p>▲Mother Crab and Baby Crab</p>
<p>The mother crab said to the baby crab: "Child, why do you always walk crookedly like this? You must walk straight!"</p>
<p>"Mother," said the baby crab, "please walk and show me so I can learn how to walk like you."</p>
<p>But the mother crab tried several times, but could never walk straight, so the baby crab just laughed at the mother crab's lesson.</p>

<p>▲Don't Sigh</p>
<p>The brain said to the two hands: "Please, you two, help me. I'm in great difficulty!"</p>
<p>The hands said: "Helping is possible, but we want you to agree to a condition!"</p>
<p>"What condition?"</p>
<p>"Please tell the mouth not to sigh anymore!"</p>
<p>The brain said: "What's the reason for that?"</p>
<p>The two hands said: "Because we are most afraid of sighing; when the mouth sighs, we can't do anything! In the future, as long as you tell the mouth to clench its teeth and hold its breath, then no matter how difficult things are, we ten brothers (fingers) will have a way to deal with them!"</p>
<p>▲Cooperation</p>
<p>The mouth said to the hand: "You and I should really cooperate!"</p>
<p>"What's the reason?" the hand said.</p>
<p>The mouth said: "Because I can connect with you in everything. For example: you can kill people, and I can eat people; you can hit people, and I can scold people!"</p>
<p>The hand said, "But I can support people!"</p>
<p>The mouth said, "I...I can say good things?"</p>
<p>"Saying good things has nothing to do with supporting people!" the hand said. "I am still supporting people when you say good things; I am still supporting people when you don't say good things!"</p>
<p>▲The Greatest</p>
<p>The ear and the eye chatted, discussing the "greatest" thing.</p>
<p>The ear said, "According to what I have heard: the sound of machines 'clicking' is the greatest; everything in human society is progressing along with this sound!"</p>
<p>The eye said, "According to what I have seen: the ten numbers 1234567890 are the greatest; the fate of human society is governed by these ten numbers!"</p>
<p>The mouth, hearing this from the side, asked the ear and the eye, "Please judge: what should I say to be considered the greatest?"</p>
<p>"According to us: it is the greatest when you don't open your mouth; because no matter what it is, once you say it, the great becomes small!" the ear and the eye replied in unison.</p>

<p>Here, the civet cat replaces the crown prince; there, the restoration goes to Nanyang; there are also colors divided into red, yellow, blue, white, and black; there is also one, two, three, and four to ponder. There are many patterns, and once greed arises, you are fooled.</p>
<p>Children! Don't taste it lightly. If you get used to gambling from a young age, it will be difficult to correct when you grow up. We want to eat candy and fruit, so we buy good quality goods from the store. It is best to save this spare money and donate it to aviation to strengthen national defense.</p>

<p>Yesha was a strong child with blood-red hair; but he didn't want to do anything all day long, just thinking about playing and deceiving people. One afternoon, he pretended to be a cripple and begged for food.</p>
<p>"Pity a poor donkey with a crippled leg! Give me a few copper coins!"</p>
<p>Just then, a child named Heli passed by him. Seeing his miserable fate, he gave him some money.</p>
<p>Many days later, in another place, Yesha pretended to be blind. Heli passed by here again. Seeing that this was the same one who had a crippled leg before, he immediately understood. He pretended to be compassionate and promised to take Yesha home to treat him well. When they arrived home, Heli led him into the large wooden pen, closed the door, and then said to Yesha:</p>
<p>"Friend, open your eyes and see what place this is! Why do you want to deceive people?"</p>
<p>After being imprisoned, Yesha never dared to deceive people again.</p>

<p>As usual, Mom gave me ten copper coins for breakfast money. But today, I hesitated when I reached the door of the steamed bun shop.</p>
<p>Didn't the teacher say? Under such circumstances, Chinese children should be diligent and self-reliant, and should not seek oral pleasure! Don't you see those little compatriots in the Northeast? Poor things! They are Chinese, but they can't even read Chinese books! They can no longer read the motherland's language with their parents, and must learn that Japanese language! Can I seek oral pleasure and not rescue my little compatriots? 丨丨 No, I must save at least one copper coin every day as a savings for aviation to save the country!</p>
<p>"Three copper coins each"! The sharp shout of the pancake seller. I unhesitatingly took out nine copper coins.</p>
<p>The old clerk of the steamed bun shop looked at me strangely; but he didn't know the taste of me chewing dry pancakes!</p>

<p>There was a grain of wheat, hiding in the barn and sighing.</p>
<p>It guessed that in a few days, the terrible farmer would bury them alive in the lower layer of the soil. It did not want such a cruel encounter, so it worried and sighed.</p>
<p>The terrible day finally arrived, but this grain of wheat was very clever, and actually escaped the farmer's attention. It could still hide safely in the barn.</p>
<p>It was happy, but also sad. Sad because all of its companions left the barn, and for a long time, there was no friend to talk to it.</p>
<p>The following spring, a large batch of new wheat entered the barn. Those were the sons of last year's companions.</p>
<p>So this grain of wheat regretted it. It said: "A grain of wheat that is not buried in the mud is still a grain and will rot; if it is not afraid of being buried, it will produce many grains."</p>

<p>— Xue Fan</p>
<p>"Daddy earns silver ingots, Mom adds a younger brother..." Huimin sat alone on the doorstep singing; but in a flash, he suddenly thought that Mom added a younger brother, where did the younger brother come from? He hurried to his mother.</p>
<p>"Mom! You're going to give me another younger brother, where does this younger brother come from?"</p>
<p>"Child"! The mother said, laughing: "You'll understand this when you grow up; you see, the cat in our house is about to have kittens, you wait and see."</p>
<p>Huimin, hearing this answer, was just suspicious. Every day he went to the cat's nest to look at the cat. The cat couldn't explain anything, just meowed at Huimin.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Willing Children <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Aiqing</p>
<p>It was very cold today, but school still required gymnastics, because Teacher Liu had said: "To have a good physique and spirit, you must train in this cold weather." Wang Sida, a third-grade student, valued this sentence very much, so his body was very strong.</p>
<p>One morning, Wang Sida saw the gymnastics teacher practicing boxing alone on the playground. He suddenly thought: "No wonder the principal likes and praises the gymnastics teacher so much. This is because he works hard himself, and that's why the result is so good!"</p>
<p>A child who is willing to work hard will definitely have good fortune in the future.</p>

<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>▲ Tails Used as Replacement for Feet</p>
<p>The kangaroo's tail is large and powerful. When its two hind legs stand upright, the tail must lean against the ground to support its body. Sometimes, it uses its tail to support its entire body and then kicks at its enemy with its hind legs.</p>
<p>▲ Tails Used for Cold Protection</p>
<p>The squirrel's tail, when it runs back and forth on branches, can both balance its body's inclination and protect its body's temperature.</p>
<p>▲ Tails that Signal Danger</p>
<p>When a deer in the mountains encounters a different kind of ferocious beast, its tail immediately stands up, and the white fur below the tail becomes even more prominent. Whenever it encounters an enemy, this white fur part shakes especially, conveying the meaning of "The enemy is coming, be careful!" to its fellows.</p>
<p>▲ Tails Usable as Rudders</p>
<p>The sea beaver in the ocean is good at swimming, and its tail is different from other animals. The shape of the tail is flat and without fur. When swimming, it is like a rudder for steering a boat.</p>

<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>▲ Introduction</p>
<p>My little friends:</p>
<p>Many little friends, although newly acquainted, have been spiritually connected for a long time. However, through recent correspondence, it seems we have become even closer. It seems a further understanding of me is also needed. I must say a few words:</p>
<p>In my previous letter, I called myself "Xiang Lao" [Country Elder]. You little friends must be wondering: "Is he an old man from the countryside?" "Is he a rustic old man?" ... pondering over the word "old." Friends, my little friends, my appellation "Xiang Lao" has absolutely no such meaning. Initially, I used these two words because I have long lived in the countryside and have been accompanied by this great nature year-round. Indeed, I have a great affection for the countryside. I miss it, and it cherishes me, so much so that I cannot separate from it. Because, in my time and your time, we were held in its embrace, jumping and dancing. And now, in your time, you meet your little friends at its knees. Singing happy songs every day, everyone is happy and harmonious, searching for the bright road to the future. A march is playing right now!</p>
<p>Little friends, do you know me now? Do you understand the meaning of "Xiang Lao"? Please use your intelligent brains to understand!</p>
<p>Goodbye!</p>
<p>▲ Lingering Autumn</p>
<p>Little friends:</p>
<p>How strange! The autumn wind, like a chaste woman, has actually put on a fierce face these past few days, "roaring and howling." I wonder who angered it? Compared to when it was kind and lovely, driving away the "sweltering heat" of the world and bringing a gentle "autumn" for humanity, it is truly "like two different people."</p>
<p>Oh! The aged skin color has the air of "approaching death." Knowing that the end is near, it gives a final, mad cry: Perhaps it fears that a poisonous world is about to descend and cannot bear for humanity to be trampled upon! However, "hoarse and exhausted," it finally overcomes the fierce god with "bared fangs and claws" and a "ferocious face!"</p>
<p>Many, many trees have all changed their clothes, wearing mourning clothes, the earth is all white, quietly indicating that this chaste woman has "died peacefully in her bed."</p>
<p>Little friends! Is a chilling atmosphere enveloping us? So many precious youth of us humans are being stripped away like this. Catch up quickly! Don't lament! Don't waste time!</p>
<p>Goodbye!</p>

<p>Min'er said to Ya Wan: "When you lock your room door and go out, why don't you tell the people at home? I had to search everywhere for you!" Ya Wan said, "I wrote it on a piece of paper and put it on the table in my room. Didn't you see it?"</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The mother came back from outside, and the son couldn't see clearly who it was, so he asked loudly, "What are you here for?" The mother said angrily, "Do you know me?" The son said, "Oh! It's Mother. Then, don't you know I'm nearsighted?"</p>

<p>I always have to turn off the lights when I sleep at night. Last night, at twelve o'clock, Song'er woke up, couldn't see anything in the darkness, and started crying. We were woken up by him and quickly asked him why he was crying. He said, "Daddy! My eyes are blind!"</p>

<p>Ya Zhen bought a goose. He happened to need to relieve himself, so he had to put the goose on the ground and run into the public toilet. Unexpectedly, someone replaced it with a duck. When Ya Zhen came out and looked at it, he said, "How strange! I only left for a moment, and it's already become so thin and small?"</p>

<h3 id="e264">Beijing City's Education Expenses Prepared for Independence <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>▲ Planning to Establish a Senior Vocational School</p>
<p>Because the Ministry of Education hopes that the educational expenses of all provinces and cities will be independent, the Nanjing Municipal Government, together with the Ministry of Education's supervisors, discussed the measures for the independence of Beijing City's education expenses a few days ago. It is reported that the principle of educational expense independence has been agreed upon. The municipal government has ordered the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to draft detailed plans, which generally involve designating several items such as housing donations, central subsidies, and other funds from the municipal government, and organizing a management committee to be responsible for supervision. The educational expenses will be stored separately to ensure thorough independence.</p>
<p>It is also heard that in the near future, the municipal government plans to reorganize and expand the junior vocational schools and establish senior vocational schools. Because the estimated start-up cost is about 400,000 yuan, it plans to request subsidies from the Boxer Indemnity Committee on the one hand and raise funds independently by the municipal government on the other hand. This kind of senior vocational school is also being planned, but it will take a little longer than the expansion of the junior vocational schools.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Opinions of Ministry of Education Commissioner Li Ximou on Education in Anhui and Jiangxi <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>▲ Ordinary Subject Teaching Methods Lack Experimentation</p>
<p>▲ Vocational Education Equipment and Teachers are Quite Lacking</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Commissioner Li Ximou, after inspecting education in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, is currently compiling a detailed report on the inspection of the two provinces. Here is a record of the situation of the two provinces' finances and points that should be generally noted, based on personal conversations.</p>
<p>▲ Financial Situation of Education (1) The educational expenses of Anhui Province are more than 2.6 million yuan annually, of which 1.2 million yuan is the central subsidy, and the remaining more than 1.4 million yuan is provided by the provincial treasury. The central subsidy is received monthly, and the provincial expenses are relatively short. The province's educational expenses are independent, and there is the establishment of an Educational Expenses Management Office, responsible for the collection and expenditure of funds. (2) The educational expenses of Jiangxi Province are 2 million yuan annually, which is the salt surtax. The funds are allocated by the Western Shore Salt Transport Bureau established by the Ministry of Finance. The province's educational expenses are independent and there is a management committee to supervise the use of the funds, and a management office is responsible for the collection and expenditure of expenses. However, the educational expense independence of the above two provinces is not as good as the direct collection of educational expenses by the Jiangsu Educational Expenses Management Office.</p>
<p>Points that should be noted: It is heard that the following are common points that should be noted in both provinces: (1) For the teaching methods of ordinary subjects, teachers only use textbooks for teaching. Classrooms lack scientific instruments for experimentation, so that subjects such as physics and chemistry lack objects to prove and experiment with, reducing students' interest. (2) For social education (popular education, adult education), there is a lack of corresponding organizers and leaders. This situation is mostly due to the lack of adequate preparation for training talents before the event. (3) Vocational education is extremely lacking in equipment and teachers, and too little emphasis is placed on local handicrafts, resulting in poor products that cannot compete with foreign goods. It is hoped that teachers in primary and secondary schools in various places will have refresher opportunities during the summer vacation to supplement their knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>(3) Normal schools should report the students of the county to the Education Bureau every semester for review. (3) The Education Bureau should observe the service performance of normal school graduates and report the inspection comments to the normal schools at the same time, so that the normal schools can help the Education Bureau supervise and improve. (4) The Education Bureau should be responsible for employing graduates of normal schools. (5) When the Education Bureau finds that a certain talent is lacking in local elementary schools, it should notify private schools to pay special attention to the training of a certain talent.

The educational administrative direct achievements exhibited by various counties were collected by themselves. Wuxian counted the number of pieces, and one-tenth had been stolen. All exquisite statistical charts and project books disappeared. The most regrettable thing was the teacher registration review sheet of the Education Bureau, which was created by the Education Bureau of the whole province. All current and former elementary school teachers had two-and-a-half-inch photos attached, and the photos of modern female teachers were secretly stolen one by one. Even the photo of male teacher Jin Weizheng was also stolen and was incomplete.</p>

On the part of the members, Bao Xindi, the first-place winner, had the demeanor and intonation of a Western orator. Zhang Dewei, the second-place winner from Jinling Women's University, had a natural attitude, humorous meaning, and gentle and accurate intonation.

The opening meeting is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e270">Attending Members <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>

<p>Chairman Chen Jinmin, recorder Xu Zeye, first the chairman reported on the preparation process, saying that during the summer vacation, in a corner of Shanghai, there was already a brewing of organizing a national body to carry out the scientific movement. Two major policies were drafted: (1) Establish a scientific experiment hall to provide science experiments for primary and secondary schools in this city, so as to change the scientific education and become the center of the scientific movement. (2) Organize groups to be the driving force for the implementation of the scientific movement. At that time, I submitted an outline to Mr. Pan Gongzhan and Tao Baichuan to forward it to Mayor Wu, trying to find ways to help. Mayor Wu immediately agreed to allocate a portion of the Fenglin Bridge site, after the municipal government moved to the central district, as the site of the scientific experiment hall, which is currently in progress. By chance, Mr. Zhang Beihai, the secretary of the Nanjing General Assembly, came to Shanghai to prepare for the Shanghai Branch of the Scientific Movement, and recommended me as the director of the preparation. After several meetings, it was established today. Then, the constitution was revised.</p>
<h3 id="e272">Work Outline <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>

(3) Investigate the current situation of scientific education in schools at all levels in this city. (4) Collect scientific toys and hold scientific toy exhibitions. (5) Hold scientific performances in primary and secondary schools in this city. (6) Publish a regular periodical, tentatively named "Science and Life." (7) Start editing scientific textbooks.</p>

<p>▲ Basic Subjects Were Tested Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Specialized Subjects Will Be Tested Starting Today</p>

<h3 id="e275">Graduates of Schools That Have Not Reported School Status Will Not Be Allowed to Take the Joint Graduation Exam <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Those Who Have Reported but Whose Supporting Documents Have Not Been Verified</p>
<p>Are Allowed to Participate First, and Certificates Will Be Issued After Verification</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order yesterday to municipal and registered private secondary schools in this city, stating that the joint secondary school graduation examination for this academic year will be held soon. Whether or not the graduating students of each school should be allowed to participate in this joint examination is based on the school status of new and transfer students reported by each school in each academic year. If schools fail to report student school status on schedule as ordered, resulting in the Education Bureau having no basis for verification, the graduating students will not be allowed to participate in the joint examination or graduation examination. For those who have already reported the school status of new and transfer students, but whose supporting documents have not been verified, and the student's school status has not been verified, a flexible approach may be adopted, allowing them to participate in the joint examination and graduation examination first.

During rest periods, they play games on the sports field or review their lessons in the self-study room. The self-study room is divided into senior vocational and junior high sections, both supervised by teachers on duty. Even on Sundays, students must obtain a leave pass from the Dean of Students before leaving the school. Female students are not allowed to ask for leave unless they have a personal letter of verification from their parents. At the same time, the school has organized clubs, including music, drama, martial arts, and chess groups. During regular weekly holidays, teachers and students gather happily, which not only prevents idleness and fosters physical and mental well-being, but is also a distinctive feature of the school's moral education. The school also pays extraordinary attention to hygiene, with a hygiene committee within the school, in which all students participate. They take turns managing cleaning, epidemic prevention, and inspecting kitchen meals every day, and hold a major cleaning session every week. Students are not allowed to have any other outside expenses except for laundry and haircuts. The school fees are also extremely low, with each person spending no more than 100 yuan per semester, including all expenses. It is said that the school's business, civil engineering materials, general studies, and junior high school classes still have dozens of vacancies, and they plan to enroll transfer students during the winter break.</p>

<p>(7-1) The Chinese team's spirit is high and consistent, while the Portuguese team's excellent skills are defeated by a lack of energy.</p>
<p>England Defeats Russia Eight to One</p>
<p>The sensational International Soccer Tournament opened yesterday. The Chinese team relied on teamwork and individual bravery to defeat Portugal 7-1 at the China Baseball Field, securing a spot in the semi-finals. More than 10,000 spectators witnessed the Chinese athletes create this great achievement, and everyone was filled with joy and congratulated each other, looking forward to the future with infinite satisfaction. May our warriors in the battle for international honor continue their efforts and achieve success. At the same time, England eliminated Russia at Yiyuan with a score of eight to one.</p>
<h3 id="e289">The Ever-Changing Battle Situation <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>Before the match, everyone had their own expectations, but the result showed that the Chinese team clearly had the upper hand and controlled the overall situation. However, the actual battle situation at the time was not entirely like that. In the first half, the Portuguese army's surprising performance was not without causing concern for the Chinese team. Within the first 15 minutes, R. Fafan had not yet arrived, and the situation was uneven, with the Chinese team attacking more than defending. Afterwards, the Portuguese army's momentum suddenly increased. When the game reached 25 minutes, the Chinese team was first defeated. Five minutes later, the Portuguese army also suffered a disaster. After a one-to-one tie, the situation became serious and shocking. A slight carelessness would have led to a change in the situation, and the Portuguese army was particularly sharp. In the end, Sun Jinshun shot a goal in the chaos, creating a 2-1 lead for the first half. In the first half, the Portuguese team was exhausted and tired of coping. The Chinese team launched a large-scale attack, heading and kicking, and won five goals in a row, which did not seem very realistic.</p>

<h3 id="e290">Each Person Has Their Own Strengths <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>The victory of the Chinese team was not due to the efforts of one or two people, but the merit of the entire team. The five forwards were all the best at the time. Even Chen Hongguang, who was serving as the left winger for the first time, did not disappoint the audience. Dai Linjing was the most lively, Sun Jinshun was calm and composed, Li Yichen had both advantages and disadvantages, and Zhong Yongsen made the most contributions. The midfield line was wonderful, with Xu and Chen showing their talents, advancing to support and retreating to defend. It can be said that it was vivid and colorful. Portuguese team's backbone, Costan, was majestic and outstanding throughout the game. Center Corasa was agile, right inside P. Fafan was hard-footed, and left inside Rosoli was good at shooting. The combination of the three made it difficult to break through. The two wings were mediocre, and the second half was especially like a decoration. The inside guards were properly arranged and did not miss much. The goalkeeper was good at the upper road, but the middle and lower roads were slightly worse. All the lost balls hit their weaknesses.</p>
<h3 id="e291">Portuguese Army Defeated After Winning First <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>At 3:00, referee Marshall blew the whistle to form the formation. The Chinese team started the northern expedition from the south. The Portuguese army fought with ten people and deployed heavy troops on the second and third lines of defense. Li Yichen and Sun Jinshun made a plan to attack the east and west. Within ten minutes, the Portuguese army did not cross the Lei Pond. After dozens of rounds, Fafan reported and the military law was greatly boosted. Corasa led the division to counterattack. Fafan penetrated deep into the frontier and got the momentum to pass in the center. Rosoli nodded his head and the ball flew like an arrow straight into the net. The audience was shocked. The Chinese team lost a goal first, and the indignation can be known. Under the counterattack order, Sun Jinshun sent troops to the north, but could not say that his brother was not his opponent, forcing a corner kick. Zhong Yongsen opened the door in front of the door. Dai Linjing was unable to wave his halberd because of the thorns on the road, so he turned around and hooked to Xu Yahui, who touched his foot suddenly. The crowd cheered and created a one-to-one tie. Not long after, Zhong Yongsen led the ball to the north, but could not say that the entanglement was endless. Zhong shouted loudly and rushed out of the formation. Yun Shi arrived in time and transmitted the center on the low line. Sun Jinshun drew his bow and shot. Cross hurriedly patted the ball and bounced out of the goalpost. Zhong reopened, the landing point was still wonderful, but unfortunately Li Yichen was offside. The Portuguese army gained momentum to counterattack, Yahui was fined, Costan took the penalty kick, as heavy as a cannonball, Zhou Xianyan pounced and saved Luoqu to take the corner kick, but did not enter the boundary line. Hongguang sent his leg from the west, passed the center guard line, and then passed to Sun to shoot at the door. Unfortunately, it was slightly biased by a foot. Xina went straight down on the right, and got the opportunity to shoot, which was patted by Zhou into a corner kick. Xina reopened and fell in front of the Chinese gate. Zhou gave up the gate and ran out to kick the ball out of danger. Li Yichen sent a message to the north, and secretly handed it to Sun Jinshun outside the penalty line. The shadows were heavy, but Sun Jinshun’s leg started to pass through the post, becoming two to one. The first half ended soon.</p>
<h3 id="e292">China Achieved Great Success <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>Announced a break to exchange positions. The Portuguese team was scattered and the momentum turned weak. The attack could not penetrate, and the defense could not protect the country. Li, Sun, and Dai quickly brought the ball to the opponent's door. Cross waved his old fist and barely survived for a moment. Sun Jinshun returned and broke into the enemy's forbidden area, passing eastward. Li Yichen deliberately leaked the room, and Hongguang picked it to the front of the door. Dai's header went into the net. Not long after, Sun Jinshun was unwilling to be selfish and advanced a few steps, passed the old Stan, and then turned over to Dai. Lei Guangbian could not grab the ball, and could not say that he was flustered and chaotic near the door. Cross was bound, and Dai smashed another ball into the goal. At this time, the Chinese team was like Yuejia's army, invincible and indestructible. Tu Kaiyuan passed a kick far to the front of the Portuguese team's door. Sun Jinshun got the ball and did not have time to think, turned around and shot immediately. The ball was accurate and fast. Although Cross touched the ball skin, it still窜into the bottom of the net. After the Portuguese team was five to one, the situation went from bad to worse, and there was no counterattack. Dai passed the ball into the formation and handed it to Li Yichen, who had not made any achievements. Sure enough, he did not live up to his expectations and hit the target with one shot. Not long after, Chen Hongguang took the responsibility and shot a ball diagonally, making a big comparison of seven to one and announcing the end of the game.</p>

<p>Yesterday's international soccer game also had a preliminary round: England vs. Russia, held at the Yiyuan dog racing track. The result was eight to one, similar to the situation at the baseball field. England's Vasess was added to the international game today, and its strength is considerable. However, limited by the new rules, no more than three military players from a country can participate as representatives, so only Tao Lehui, Aqiao, and Maolin were selected. Otherwise, they would be even more powerful. Russia is mostly from the Sakhalin area. Fighting against them is like hitting a stone with an egg. The first half was four to one, and in the second half, England scored four more goals, making it eight to one. Russia was eliminated. The lineups are as follows:</p>

<p>The second game was between Tianjin Lianghua and Allies. Lianghua was led by the famous Far East general Tang Baokun. Half of the other members were prepared for the Hebei team in the National Games. The whole team's work was detailed and charming. The talents of the whole team were extremely average. Looking at it, you know that it is a trained team, far from being comparable to the strong and reckless players in Shanghai without training. Judging from the situation of yesterday's battle, the Hua team only has Hujiang to decide the outcome. However, competing with McLing and Pirates, Lianghua seems optimistic. Allies have no contact, but it is also comforting to lose 35-50. However, the referee was not strict in enforcing the law, and there were occasional rude actions on both sides, which was a flaw.</p>
<h3 id="e301">Many Applauses <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>Under the 交綏, Lianghua won a lot of applause from the audience with its beautiful passing. Liu Zhenyuan fouled, and Xu Kepei missed the penalty. Then, Xu Kepei was seen shooting from halftime, turning around in front of the basket, and lifting in with one hand, getting two more points. Allies took a 4-0 lead. Lianghua had a plan in mind and was not discouraged at all. The edge gradually emerged, and the rear of Allies 陷空虚, and Lianghua crossed Chencang secretly, increasing the score and jumping to 22-9. Allies paused to cheer up slightly, and their momentum was once like a blaze, adding many points. In the first half, Lianghua had 24 points and Allies had 14 points.</p>

<p>After resting and fighting again, Liang Guoquan's free throw was recorded. Lianghua's momentum was strong, and the supernatural pass, the applause of the people. Liu Zhenyuan's eyes aimed accurately, and many shots hit. Although Allies struggled hard, their movements were slow, and many passes were lost. Therefore, the situation was very different. Lianghua led 47-26. Allies made a desperate counterattack. Xia Zeren volunteered and shot several long shots, all of which hit the target. Continuing to work hard, he chased to 33-47. Since then, both sides stood on the same footing and built bridges with each other. The final result was Lianghua winning 50-35. Referee Qian Qin.</p>

<p>Lianghua and Pusung will still have competitions tonight. Lianghua's opponent is Jiangwan, and Pusung's enemy was originally Zhanghua, but now it has been changed to Hujiang. It is found that Jiangwan's strength is quite strong this season and is comparable to Allies, or even better. Although Lianghua still has hope of winning, it will be more difficult than yesterday's battle. The Pusung team specializes in strong hits without any tricks, and it will be difficult to beat Hujiang. The competition location is still the Chinese basketball room. Tickets are 大洋元.

<p>— Wu Xi</p>
<p>Some say, "Truly powerful literary works should be like mellow wine, easy to drink."</p>
<p>I cannot agree with this statement.</p>
<p>What constitutes a literary work? It is not determined by whether it is "mellow" or "extremely strong" to drink, but by the work's artistic merit: this is what I think.</p>
<p>For example, a piece of writing called a literary work might have a "sword-drawn-and-bow-bent" form, but lacks the "sword-drawn-and-bow-bent" content. This cannot be considered a "truly powerful literary work." If it has content and a form suitable for the content, but lacks artistic value – perhaps just a collection of new terms and slogans, or merely a description of concepts – it cannot be considered "art." If it is indeed artistic, even though it is "extremely strong" both when drinking and after, can we exclude it from the realm of art, using the condition of "not mellow to drink" to deny its existence as a "literary work"?</p>
<p>Conversely, just because it is "mellow to drink" does not necessarily mean it is a "truly powerful literary work," and it might "intoxicate you to death later on." We must also consider the artistic value of this "mellow wine." "The subject matter is just a simple story" – that is, of course, not a problem. However, even if the subject matter is not simple, but it is real: perhaps an accidental material, but this accident reveals necessity: can such a subject matter not be taken up? Moreover, even if it is "mellow to drink" and then "intoxicating," is this "intoxication" due to the fragrance of the wine, or due to the toxins contained within fermenting? Our literary theorists cannot but pay attention to this, right? However, this is beyond the scope of the current topic.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say, "truly powerful literary works" should be viewed from the perspective of the work's artistic merit. Placing the focus of investigation on whether it is "mellow" or not "mellow" to drink will not only make people "confused" but also lead them to repeat old "wrong paths."</p>
<p>"But it is not to say that literary works that are extremely strong to drink are not wanted. However, writers should not be satisfied with just being strong to drink." Although the wording is tactful, it actually denies the existence of the former.</p>
<p>Who has ever said that literary works only need to be "active," "sharp," and "stimulating" in "words"?</p>
<h3 id="e307">Reading Yan's Family Instructions <a href="#e307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>When Liang Qichao and Mr. Hu Shih were compiling lists of books that scholars of Chinese studies must read, I was only fourteen or fifteen years old. For some reason, I originally had a strong ambition to study Chinese studies, but when I saw those lists, I was intimidated and gave up on Chinese studies altogether. I only randomly read a few collections of poems and prose from those lists, hoping to gain some benefit in writing. As for Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism and other books on moral cultivation, I didn't read a single one.</p>
<p>Now it seems that I am not alone. In general, young people almost entirely focus on writing and neglect morality in terms of cultivation. Therefore, people's hearts are not as they used to be, and young people are becoming increasingly frivolous, especially those who write, most of them often lack kindness. Recently, someone has proposed moral cultivation for young people and recommended good books as the foundation for cultivation, which I think is a very meaningful thing. This is much more important than the issue of how to cultivate oneself in literature, which was proposed at the same time. At least for myself, I feel the need to read these good books. However, I have flipped through the "Analects" and "Mencius" before, but not as moral books. Only "Yan's Family Instructions" has always made me hesitate because of the words "family instructions," so I have never read it. Now I want to read it, and I have to start with this book.</p>
<p>After reading it, I have certainly benefited a lot in terms of morality丨but I still have to wait until I can follow the instructions and put them into practice丨but at the same time, I discovered a contradiction that made me feel bewildered. Originally, I am someone who still wants to write, and the reason why I want to cultivate morality at the same time is to do both, to "accumulate morality" and to "be able to write." However, according to the examples given by Yan, "literati have always been prone to frivolity." There is often a contradiction between writing and morality. He said: "Qu Yuan exposed his talent and praised himself, revealing the faults of the ruler; Song Yu's appearance was seductive, seen as an actor; Dongfang Manqian was humorous and vulgar; Sima Xiangru stole wealth and had no integrity; Wang Bao exaggerated his virtues; Yang Xiong's virtue was defeated by his beautiful new style; Li Ling surrendered to the barbarians; Liu Xin betrayed the Han dynasty; Fu Yi was a partisan of powerful families; Ban Gu stole his father's history; Zhao Yuanshu's resistance was excessive; Feng Jingtong was frivolous and extravagant; Ma Jichang was flattering and received ridicule; Cai Yong shared the same evil and was executed; Wu Zhi criticized his hometown; Cao Zhi was arrogant and violated the law; Du Du asked for leave without satisfaction; Lu Cui was extremely narrow-minded; Chen Lin was truly crude and careless; Fan Qin had no self-control; Liu Zhen was forced to work as a laborer; Wang Can was impatient and disliked; Kong Rong and Mi Heng were arrogant and led to their downfall; Yang Xiu and Ding Yi stirred up trouble and were killed; Ruan Ji was impolite and corrupted customs; Ji Kang was arrogant and met a violent end; Fu Xuan was dismissed from office for fighting; Sun Chu was arrogant and disrespectful; Lu Ji rebelled and took risks; Pan Yue spoke empty words and courted danger; Yan Yannian was stubborn and dismissed; Xie Lingyun was empty and disorderly; Wang Yuanzhang was a fierce bandit who brought disaster upon himself; Xie Xuanhui was insulting and was punished…" Even the likes of Ziyou, Zixia, Xun Kuang, and Mencius… were also said by Yan to have "caused more harm than good."</p>
<p>Looking at the names listed above, most of them are important authors in the "Selections of Refined Literature." If their works were removed, the "Selections of Refined Literature" would lose its value for recommending to young literary enthusiasts. However, from a moral point of view, they are worthless. Even Mencius, who wrote "Mencius," is not accepted by moralists. Therefore, is there not only a contradiction between literature and morality, but also a contradiction between morality and morality?</p>
<p>Confucius must have been the most moral, but he had no writing. Yan himself also has literary works, but they are not considered outstanding when included in the "Selections of Refined Literature." Who is the perfect person who "accumulates morality and is able to write"? Is it only Ouyang Wenzhong Gong? However, the poem "Willow of Jiangnan" was also suspected of "stealing from his nephew," and was slandered by Qian Mufu. This really makes us young people with aspirations for cultivation wonder where to go.</p>
<p>Yan explained the reason why literati are prone to destruction, saying: "The nature of writing emphasizes excitement and expresses spirituality, making people arrogant, so they neglect self-control and are eager to advance. This is an increasingly serious problem for contemporary literati… Moreover, the injuries caused by slander are worse than those caused by spears and halberds, and the disasters of satire are faster than the wind." This is indeed very true. On this point, we should strictly abide by Yan's instructions: "It is advisable to be deeply cautious to preserve good fortune." (The above original texts are all from the "On Writing" chapter)</p>
<p>Not only are there contradictions between morality and writing, and between morality and morality, but there are also contradictions between writing and writing. For example, the "Encouraging Learning" chapter says:</p>
<p>"There was a powerful official who misread the Shu Capital Rhapsody, annotating: 'Dun Chi' is taro. This is because it looks like the character for sheep. Someone gave him mutton, and he replied in a letter, 'Thank you for the donation of Dun Chi,' which shocked the entire court, who did not understand the meaning. Only after a long time of investigation did they realize this."</p>
<p>This anecdote is actually caused by too much literary cultivation. If it were an ordinary person, they would simply say "Thank you for the donation of mutton." Although it would show a lack of vocabulary, it would certainly not cause "the entire court to be shocked and not understand the meaning." The instructors might say, "That's because he read the wrong version of the Shu Capital Rhapsody!" However, who can guarantee that the "Selections of Refined Literature" does not have any wrong versions?</p>
<h3 id="e308">Pier <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuanpeng</p>
<p>When there is no headwind, the pier boat arrives at a fixed time upstream. Every day, just as the city lights up, the pier boat blows its conch shell to dock.</p>
<p>Today, from morning till dusk, it has been raining, and a strong north wind has been blowing. The weather is gloomy and terribly cold, as if snow is about to fall. It is already past 9 PM, but the boat has not yet arrived.</p>
<p>The pier coolies and innkeepers are hiding in small bars and teahouses, waiting for the passengers from the boat. The cold compels them to breathe out misty air, and their teeth are chattering. They want to drink a sip of hot wine or hot tea to increase their body temperature. They constantly approach the window facing the river to look at the dark river surface. There is a spark of fire, sometimes red, sometimes black. It gradually moves forward, and it also seems to gradually retreat… Someone's shouts can be faintly heard on the beach.</p>
<p>"Those are the boatmen!"</p>
<p>Someone asks, "Have you seen the boat?"</p>
<p>The reply is, "I've seen the boat's lights."</p>
<p>So someone says in a seemingly happy voice, "Then the boat will arrive soon."</p>
<p>Another group of poorer coolies who are not qualified to enter the bars and teahouses to avoid the wind are gathered in a corner where the wind cannot reach, burning a pile of garbage. Each of them has dreamy eyes.</p>
<p>It is already past 11 PM in the city, and they look at the river again. The boat's lights seem to be still in the same place. But the torches lit by the boatmen on the beach can be seen very clearly.</p>
<p>"The boat is coming soon," someone says again.</p>
<p>"It looks very close, but it will take at least an hour. With such a strong wind, the boat is also blown back…"</p>
<p>The small city is completely asleep. The boat's conch shell blows loudly in the dead of night. The boat finally docks.</p>
<p>The various bars and snack shops along the pier turn on their oil lamps, waiting for the "hungry" customers who come down from the boat.</p>
<p>The innkeepers and coolies, with their hazy, dreamy eyes wide open, rush out and crowd onto the pier.</p>
<p>But what comes out of the cabin is a group of "broke" people. They have no luggage other than a small package. These are people who do not need coolies and are not worth the "greeting" of innkeepers! Who would be willing to go out in such bad weather if they had money? The coolies and innkeepers quietly disperse with disappointed hearts.</p>
<p>The boatmen come ashore and barge into the bar. Their faces are swollen from the wind and appear brownish. Wet footprints are scattered on the floor, and their feet are completely white from being soaked in water.</p>
<p>The bar owner, who is used to saying nice things:</p>
<p>"Poor you, having to be barefoot in the water in such cold weather…"</p>
<p>The boatmen seem to be comforted: "Only you pity us, boss lady. Quickly get us a pound of wine, scalding hot…"</p>
<p>They drink, drink, and call for more until the second half of the night, when the bar owner dozes off on the counter. The boatmen stagger out drunkenly.</p>
<p>"Boss lady, put it on my tab, I didn't bring any cash!"</p>
<p>She reluctantly utters an "oh" sound. She seems to have guessed that the boatmen had no cash. She closes the bar door and thinks that she is not happy to open the door again tomorrow. She feels that running a small bar is not the way out…</p>

<p>Brother Lie Wen:</p>
<p>Today, I saw Mr. Qi Ying's article "Chaliapin and Gorky." The Chaliapin story he remembers is something I didn't know. I once read his autobiography published in 1927. In that book, he didn't mention his unwillingness to return to his homeland, but he said that his "escape" from his homeland was because he had stayed in his homeland for too long and was afraid that the European art world would forget him. Therefore, with the help of Lunacharsky, he left his homeland on Li Lie Weizhi's special train. Without the description in Mr. Qi Ying's book "Masks and People," we would have been easily deceived by him. Now, judging from Mr. Qi Ying's writing, this Mr. Chaliapin did have a somewhat "slippery" attitude towards his homeland after the revolution. His homeland did not abandon him, but he abandoned his homeland first, which is not commendable.</p>
<p>I am unwilling to distort a worshiper of the aristocracy as a free man of art for the sake of praising art, so please publish this letter in "Free Talk" to show the readers and Mr. Qi Ying. Shi Zhecun</p>
<h3 id="e310">Two Brothers (6) (8) <a href="#e310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— Guy de Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>He was gripped by a sudden terror, which came so quickly and authoritatively that it was as if he had burst into his bedroom without even opening the door.</p>
<p>The room seemed empty. Only a candle on the wardrobe illuminated the room.</p>
<p>Jean ran to the window, which was closed, even the shutters were closed. He turned around and searched the dark corners of the room with his panicked gaze. Then he saw that the curtains on the bed had been lowered. He rushed to lift them. His mother was sleeping in his bed, her face buried in the pillow, which she had grabbed with her spasmodic hands and placed on her head so as not to hear anything anymore.</p>
<p>At first, he thought she was suffocating. Then he grabbed her shoulder and turned her over. She still hadn't abandoned the pillow that covered her face, which she was biting with her mouth to avoid crying out.</p>
<p>But as soon as he touched this stiff body, these two spasmodic arms, he understood the indescribable pain she had suffered. Watching her use her hands and teeth so resolutely and forcefully to stuff the feather-filled bag into her mouth, covering her ears and eyes, so that he couldn't see her or talk to her, he knew from the blow he himself had suffered how much pain one could endure. Then his heart, his simple heart, was overwhelmed with pity. He was not a judge, not even a merciful judge, he was only a weak person, a gentle son. He didn't remember anything else she had said to him. He didn't investigate or argue. He just touched his mother's motionless body with her hands. Unable to take the pillow off her face, he kissed her clothes and cried:</p>
<p>"Mom, Mom, my poor Mom, look at me!"</p>
<p>She would have been dead if a barely visible shiver, a vibration of a taut string, hadn't run through her body. He said repeatedly:</p>
<p>"Mom, Mom, listen to me, this is not true. I know this is not true."</p>
<p>She twitched, choked, and then suddenly sobbed on the pillow. Then all her nerves relaxed. Her stiff muscles softened, and her half-open fingers released the pillow. He discovered her tearful face.</p>
<p>Her face was completely white, and tears streamed from her closed eyelids. He hugged her neck, kissed her eyes, kissed her slowly, frantically, and forcefully, his lips soaked with her tears. He kept saying:</p>
<p>"Mom, dear Mom, I know this is not true. Don't cry, I know! This is not true!"</p>
<p>She sat up, staring at him, and said to him with the courage needed to commit suicide in certain situations:</p>
<p>"You're wrong, it's true, my child."</p>
<p>Then there was silence between them. For a moment, she choked again. She straightened her throat and tilted her head back to breathe. Then she overcame herself again and said:</p>
<p>"It's true, my child. Why would I lie? It's true. If I lied, you wouldn't believe it."</p>

<h3 id="e311">Financial Silver Prices Increase, But Not Satisfactorily; Gold Market Has Little Rebound <a href="#e311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>Midday Situation Mostly Sideways, Up 8.3 Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market is trending towards stability, but the midday situation is mostly sideways, with sentiment steady but slightly uncertain. The potential for covering short positions is increasing. There is a lack of direct relevant news from overseas. The market situation is quite mediocre. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US rose, and exchange rates also increased. The gold exchange's forward silver prices rose between 0.09 and 0.0114. London gold rose by one penny. The US official gold buying price was unchanged. Stocks rose by 3.37 yuan, US wheat rose by 0.3125, and US cotton rose by 0.05 pounds. The opening price for wool jumped to 87-88 yuan, likely because the previous day's sharp decline was excessive, and the overseas exchange rate was unsatisfactory, causing excitement. However, supply continued to be strong at high prices, and downstream, after falling to around 81 yuan, buyers emerged and struggled within 4 yuan. After the opening, the foreign firms were buying, and the domestic market tightened and rose. However, due to sudden selling by large players, there was a slight decline. Banks had a strong appetite, and the gold market trended towards stability. Buyers also showed their strength in the market. Large players such as Guangbang and Dadecheng aggressively bought and rose. Unexpectedly, banks were willing to sell at higher prices, and the supply from Chinese merchants continued to be strong. Although there was news from Reuters, it was not important, but people's sentiment was uncertain. The domestic market hardened. Large players, except for Guangbang, also sold off, falling into 80 yuan at one point. At noon, it was still stable due to short covering. The cash price was 1074 yuan. Now, the midday market situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 684.3 yuan, an increase of 8.3 yuan compared to the previous day. Spot goods opened at 4 yuan. The exchange rate in the morning opened with the near-term selling price for British pounds at 1 shilling, 3 pence, and 0.8125. The US exchange rate was 33.875 yuan. Foreign firms sought to settle the January US dollar at 34 yuan, the January gold at 0.625 for March, and 0.9375 for April. Hengxing and Huixiang entered the market, and the price rose to 5 yuan. Zhifeng, Yonghongli, Richang, and others sold off at higher prices, falling to 2.5 yuan. However, with the exchange rate continuing to tighten, Huabi Magali bought the April US dollar at 0.875, and North Korean gold also entered the same month at 0.8125. Hengxing, Yuanmao Yongda, Dadecheng Qianchangxiang, and others jointly bought, and Yuanchun spot goods were supplied, and the situation hovered and rose. After entering, it was learned that HSBC's listed price had risen by 0.125 overall, with the US fearing 0.25. Seeing no more, people's sentiment stabilized. Hengxing, Hengchang Yongda, Dadecheng Qianchangxiang, Zhifeng Yongyuansheng Yong, and others successively bought. The April US dollar bank pairing has been at 0.75, and gradually rose to 7 yuan. After entering, the April US dollar at 0.75 could be settled and fell. Dadecheng Fuyu Yuanmao Yong Zhaofengchang and others sold the April US dollar at 35 yuan again and again, but there were no buyers. It broke the 80 yuan mark and fell to 79.5 yuan. Hengxing Hengyu Dafayong Changsheng Yong and others entered at low prices. Huabi Zhenggin bought April at 35 yuan, rising back to above 83 yuan. Hengchang Yong Tianfeng and others sold, and it fell again to 1 yuan. Bingxing vigorously covered positions, Hengqin Fuyu Hengyu Hongxing Dingchang Yuansheng Yongshunli Hengxing Yong continuously entered, rising to 5.8 yuan, Hengyu Yifeng Yong sold off, and then retreated to 3 yuan, Bingxing bought. The noon closing price rose to 684.3 yuan. After the closing, Yuanmao Yong Hengxing Hongli Cuitai sold to within 3.5 yuan. Bingxing Dalian Gang took advantage of the low price to enter to 4.5 yuan. Finally, Yuanmao Yong came to sell, lacking opponents, and fell to 3 yuan again. Spot goods have been auctioned for 3.9 yuan. It was found that the highest price in the half day was 687 yuan, and the lowest price in the morning was 679.5 yuan, a difference of 7.5 yuan. The result was a recovery of 8.3 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price was 33.25 yuan because HSBC's listed US exchange rate increased by 0.25. The bid price was over 721 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 37 yuan less, approximately 14 yuan weaker than the previous closing price. The account price for this month is 699 yuan, 693 yuan for January, and 684 yuan for February. The water replenishment in the morning was 699 yuan. The cash price was 1074 yuan. The market situation was sluggish, lacking transactions. The buyers also bought. Only the Tianjin Gang sold 200 taels to Yingfeng Heng, at a price of 1074 yuan. After entering, it became weak. The Tianjin Gang still had a selling appetite at 1072-73 yuan, while the peers had no intention of buying. However, there were buyers at 1069 yuan. There are still 4368 slips left for this month and 1841 slips for January.</p>
<p>The market demand for transactions is still balanced. Overall, Hongxing Bingxing Dafayong Fuyu Qianchangxiang Xianghe Yifeng Yong Yuanchun Yongfeng Zhaofengchang Shenkang Futai Heng Huixiang Hengxing and others are on the buying side. Tili Wanxing Hengchang Yong Yongdetai Fengcheng Zhifeng Yong Yuanmao Yong Yuanxing Yong Changsheng Yong Yi Da Yong Richang Senchang Yong Hongli and others are on the selling side. Hengtai Yuanmao Hengxing Yuanda Dadecheng and others first entered and then exited. Dakang Xiexing Yong and others first exited and then entered.

<h3 id="e316">Securities Market: Except for Swap Transactions, Bond Market Sees Very Little New Trading <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>Prices of various bonds fluctuate slightly with swap transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a relatively stable market. Except for swap transactions, there was very little new trading. Market prices fluctuated, slightly rising or falling depending on whether long or short positions were being swapped. Regarding the overall situation, although the conflict between Fujian and Zhejiang has made contact, both long and short sides remain in a wait-and-see attitude, hoping for future victory, and are mutually persistent. Therefore, the market is calm. Long positions are more common in swaps, and market prices are slightly weak. However, the trend remained strong at the close. At the opening in the morning, short swaps saw a difference of 2 yuan between near-term and distant terms for treasury bonds. Salt tax and other near-term and distant terms differed by 1 yuan for most. Market prices for treasury bonds were slightly better at 19 customs gold by 1-2 jiao, while the rest all returned slightly by 1-4 jiao. In the second session, long swaps were appropriate, and various groups sold this month and bought distant terms, and the market price showed a phenomenon of near-term weakness and distant-term strength. The trend still appeared slightly weak. The market opened in the afternoon with still many short swaps. Except for a slight increase of 0.15 jiao for the unified tax, the rest all returned 1-2 jiao. There were very few closing transactions, with only some settlement transactions on the surface. Front prices were slightly lower, while rear prices were stronger. The overall situation for the day showed no clear trend. Because both long and short swaps have considerable limitations, there were no major increases or decreases in trading. In the end, the prices of two or three varieties for the current month were slightly better by 1 jiao, while the rest were all down slightly by 1-5 jiao. In general, near-term was stronger than distant-term. The total transaction volume was 15.48 million yuan, including 5,000 yuan in spot goods, 5.75 million in unified salt tax futures, 3.09 million in treasury bonds, 1.48 million in 19 customs gold, 2.33 million in 20 bonds of 20 customs, and the rest ranging from tens of thousands to 3-500,000 yuan. Jin Duanzheng's 6 also did around 2 million.</p>

<p>New Harvest Foreign Firm reported that on the 22nd, the New York stock market was affected by silver, soaring 10 yuan. Then, due to profit-taking by longs, it fell back slightly. At the close, it was still boosted by strong silver. Auto stocks, especially Chrysler and General Motors, rose due to positive reports on the auto industry. Wet stocks saw ups and downs due to alcohol tax relations. In the foreign exchange market, the strength of Middle Eastern currencies was the most prominent phenomenon, especially Hong Kong and Shanghai. Public bonds rose, except for US public bonds. The total daily turnover was 2.42 million shares. "Wheat" rose due to short covering and new buying related to silver. There was considerable enthusiasm for buying "cotton," which was generally believed to be another indication of the government's policy of raising prices in the silver announcement. The Finance and Recovery Agency purchased gold at a price of 34.06 yuan per tael, unchanged. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market rose slightly because the current month's long positions were maintained by the company, which purchased at a limit price of 170 yuan. About 1,000 bales were purchased in the previous two days, so the 70-yuan level was not broken. The distant-term market rose slightly, but actual demand remained sluggish and sales to customers were slow.</p>

<p>The cotton market rose slightly, but US cotton rose by more than 20 points, while the gold market was flat. The sentiment in the market was still flat. The problem of factories receiving goods this month has not yet been decided, so the market is volatile. However, the environment is not good, and factories are still purchasing little, so spot cotton consumption is quite sluggish. Currently, the Ningbo group has a huge amount of hedging, and the market is tight.</p>

<p>The Zheng cotton market opened in the morning. Because the rise in US cotton was not strong and the rise in silver prices was not intense, there were not many speculators in the market. By the close, it had risen slightly by 0.05 to 0.12 yuan. The market situation continued to rise in the afternoon, with each month rising by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 57,900 dan.

Liverpool cotton spot prices rose 1 point, and futures rose 5 points. The Bombay cotton market was firm due to purchases by European exporters and a few Japanese merchants. As a result, Pingar Olmra both rose 1 rupee 2.5 jiao, and Bailuoxi rose 7.5 jiao. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 22nd):</p>

<p>▲ Trading is Slack Due to Holidays</p>
<p>A report from New York on the 22nd regarding the cotton market for the week states that the cotton market was limited last week due to the approaching holidays, and most of the trading was for the near term. The long positions for December and January were mostly swapped to distant terms. There was very little selling in the South. The increase in spot goods traditionally given before the holidays has not materialized, reportedly because most cotton farmers have accepted a deposit of 1 jiao. Although business has improved somewhat, it is limited by the uncertainty of the future of the gold standard. The dispute over the reduction of cotton fields in 1934 will begin soon, and the results will be decided at the end of January. People in the industry are waiting for a turnaround in commerce and the performance of the next crop. The basic commodity market is quiet and firm, also hoping for a revival of demand in the new year.</p>
<h3 id="e326">Grains: Large Quantities of American Flour Reportedly Being Shipped <a href="#e326" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c326" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">326</a></h3>
<p>| Standard Flour Weakens Again |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market initially rose, then fell, and finally weakened again. In the morning, the market sentiment was very good because the American telegram reported that wheat futures rose by 1 yuan. Factories covered positions, and all months remained firm. In the afternoon, it was rumored in the market that flour accounted for 4/10 of the wheat that was borrowed and that it would be gradually shipped to Shanghai for sale. The actual sales of flour in the Shanghai market are not strong. With large quantities of American flour arriving in Shanghai, the market must fall further. Therefore, domestic buyers have no business sense. However, factories are not selling off and have even taken advantage of small covering positions, slightly holding up the market. However, actual sales and customer hoarding are not interested, so the market is still trending downward. Therefore, January is down by 0.015 yuan, February is down by 0.0125 yuan, April and May are down by 0.01 yuan each, March is down by 0.0075 yuan, and the current month is also down by 0.0025 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e327">Trading of Futures Wheat is Quiet <a href="#e327" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c327" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">327</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was quiet in both the morning and afternoon, and there were few transactions throughout the day. Factories were watching, and speculative traders did not sell, with both sides sticking to their positions, waiting for opportunities. However, foreign wheat telegrams reported an increase of more than 1 yuan. New foreign wheat has not been unloaded because the issue of tax exemption has not been resolved, so standard wheat has temporarily returned to flat. The closing price was 0.01 yuan higher for January and 0.01 yuan lower for February, March, and April. Since the new foreign wheat has not been unloaded from the docks, spot wheat in the market has turned around. Yesterday, Shen Da shipped two small cars of Haizhou wheat and Dali Ji wheat, priced at 4.09 yuan to 4.05 yuan, which was also several points better than the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e328">Thick Layers of Late Rice Continue to Decline by a Small Angle <a href="#e328" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c328" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">328</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various groups were still surging, with a total of 60-70 boats arriving (8-9,000 piculs), of which only 20+ were late rice. However, the accumulation in Pudong was relatively thick, so those who contracted, such as customer groups and those on the docks, were able to move more than 3,000 packages of their remaining goods. However, the price continued to decline by a small angle. As for the thick Japonica rice from various groups, although the arrival of goods was quite surging, the sales and digestion of the shops were strong, and the supply and demand were balanced. However, both sides were in a wait-and-see attitude regarding the problem of eating the market. As a result, the situation became a fixed one with a soft tendency. The sharp goods of Du Yang were devoid of honor or disgrace, and the route for returning the original currency was slightly stagnant, leading to another decline.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) 55-6 ships arrived from various routes. Sales of various colors in the market were still weak. The price of white Japonica and customer Indica was fixed. The price of thin rice, early rice, and sheep Du Bu Indica fell by several points. White original and Yin yuan were slightly tight.</p>
<h3 id="e329">Local Customer Indica has Some Transactions <a href="#e329" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c329" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">329</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the customer Indica market situation temporarily remained stable. Because there were two more arrivals and stockpiles recently, the market price has fallen repeatedly. However, the price was once lowered to facilitate transactions with local customers, but then stopped. The owners initially sought to sell vigorously, intending to end early. However, because the market price was too small and not cost-effective, and because there were still no major transactions despite the price drop, they then stuck to their positions and did not sell cheaply. Local customers were interested in the route, but the Fujian groups were affected by the current situation and could not continue to facilitate transactions. If there was a ship position and it was convenient, they would have to load the goods at the market. Local sales continued to be catered to, and stockers were temporarily on the sidelines. The city sold 250 bags of Wuhu machine yuan rice from the local street, priced at 7.8 to 7.3 yuan; 100 bags of Hunan machine oil rice, priced at 7.2 yuan; and 200 bags of machine Jing, priced at 7.15 yuan. The market situation was not much different from the previous market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was without transactions due to today being the weekend, with no shipping out, and with the weakening of the Dutch exchange rate and customs gold. However, the first batch of new Zhang Diaoqing has been shipped by Taikoo Company's Damino, only 170 bags. Because no samples have been seen yet, it has not been opened. According to Zhang information, the transaction price is also decreasing due to the gradual decline in the asking price for Chaoqing. It is estimated that it will only be available for exchange next week.</p>

<p>Although there were not many old Zhangzhou dried longan arriving and stockpiled recently, sales were very slow and it was difficult to get a good price. Merchants had no intention of importing more, and the offers were mostly very unreasonable. Yesterday, it was heard that some had already been exchanged out first, down by 1-2 yuan compared to the previous deal. It has not yet opened up, which shows that it is not easy to turn around.</p>
<h3 id="e332">Oil Market: Raw Soybean Oil Falls Across the Board <a href="#e332" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c332" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">332</a></h3>
<p>▲ Soybean Oil: Yesterday, the market was fatigued due to the sharp drop in the Dalian telegram. Because the waterway for foreign merchants in the producing area was not smooth, the local source of Shanghai was surging. Currently, there are still about 10,000 pieces of large and small basket oil stockpiled. Local sales in the city are mainly to the mainland, but the mainland’s buying power is shrinking, and local oil workshops are selling at low prices, resulting in few shipments from Shanghai. Two batches of Dalian Qidou oil were released in the market yesterday, totaling 200 pieces of wheel goods, priced at 11 yuan, and 400 pieces of sand boat oil, priced at 11.05 yuan. The prices were all down by 0.03 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Raw Oil: The market is also not buoyant. The source is not surging, so there is not much bottom accumulation, about 1-200 pieces. However, the waterway is still smooth, but the price has gradually decreased. The market must fall by 0.08 yuan yesterday, with 1,500 pieces of warehouse oil transacted, with the price opening at 10.05 yuan, and 300 pieces of Parker oil, with the price at 10.07 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e333">White Tung Oil Market in Hankou is Slightly Better <a href="#e333" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c333" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">333</a></h3>
<p>After the Hankou market for white tung oil fell to 22 yuan, it could not help but react slightly due to the excessive decline, and it immediately increased to 22.2 yuan. According to Hankou telegrams yesterday, it has already risen slightly, opening at 22.8 yuan in foreign specifications, with a total of more than 200 tons transacted. The lowest price for Xiang tung opened at 17.5 yuan, and it also rose to 18 yuan yesterday. The support support also increased to 18 yuan. The above are all customer specifications, and Hankou has imported 2-3,000 dan. However, because the market has fallen to this level, merchants dare not sell short, and foreign firms are unwilling to import in advance, because another decline is limited, and a turnaround is not expected. Therefore, Hankou merchants and foreign firms are shipping out as soon as they are approved, and there seems to be no chance to see. Zhejiang tung is somewhat similar and slightly better, but it is unexpected that the situation on the Zhejiang border is tight again, and it is inevitable that it will be slightly hit. Hang merchants had a sale of open box Xizhu at 20.02 yuan the other day, but it has been silent and unheard of recently. But since the Hankou market has slightly turned around, perhaps this can be stationed and settled, otherwise it will not be able to maintain itself.</p>
<h3 id="e334">Piece Goods: Velvet Reduces Price to Sell <a href="#e334" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c334" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">334</a></h3>
<p>The velvet market is increasingly quiet and tired, and transactions are lighter than at this time in previous years. The situation is unstable, exports have decreased, credit is tight, street sales are subtle, and sellers are reducing cheap prices to try to sell. Yesterday, Dong goods thin flannel reduced sales by 3 yuan, with the head number at 3.4 yuan and the second number at 3.25 yuan. West goods snuff Walter flannel sold at 3.85 yuan, and Hao Hua colorful overcoat flannel at 4.8 yuan. Most of them have to lose several jiao to 1 yuan on average from the original.</p>
<h3 id="e335">Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Sales are Extremely Quiet <a href="#e335" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c335" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">335</a></h3>
<p>▲ Lyons Factory Drops Sharply: According to reliable information from the local Sinfu Foreign Firm, the price of white factory warp in the Lyons raw silk market has gradually dropped sharply, because hoarders are actively dumping at the end of the year. Grade A pulled and combined Chinese currency has fallen by 700 yuan per bag, and Grade B has also fallen close to 600 yuan, so it is even more difficult for Shanghai factories to sell off.</p>
<p>▲ American Sales of Dry Warp Stop: American sales of Lyons warp have plummeted. Local American merchants have been rarely throwing money for dry warp purchases. Shipments to the United States have stopped. No dry warp was shipped to American territories last week, but 75 packages were shipped to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>▲ It is Difficult to Expect Sales of Artificial Silk: With the year-end approaching, it is difficult for sales of artificial silk to turn around smoothly. Yesterday, only Xun Zhen and other silk merchants imported 16 boxes of cash futures such as Hong Jinzhong Jin Shuanglu brands, priced at 174.525 yuan clean plate.</p>

<h3 id="e354">The Conflict Between Brains and Bellies <a href="#e354" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c354" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">354</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>In these turbulent times, any young person unwilling to be left behind wants to diligently pursue education and fill their mind. But to achieve this goal, a problem must first be solved: finding a way to keep the belly from being empty, because an empty, hungry belly makes learning impossible. However, in this day and age, unless one has vast family wealth, avoiding the danger of an empty belly—solving the problem of livelihood—is no easy task. Even if one is fortunate enough to find a job that keeps the belly full and in a normal state, it is impossible to simultaneously concentrate on studying and filling the mind. With the unemployment crisis growing, job sectors are overcrowded and working hours are increasing. If you are lucky enough to find a job, besides the time spent working and socializing to keep it, can you still find free time to study? From this, it is clear that one cannot cater to the belly and the brain at the same time; if one wants to cater to the brain, one cannot cater to the belly: the two are in conflict at present.</p>
<p>We often see in classified ads in newspapers that many young people are looking for jobs, some hoping to achieve the goal of working part-time and studying part-time. This clearly shows that, under the two great desires of survival and knowledge, they want to eliminate the conflict between belly and brain, and want to nourish both at the same time. But the reality tells us that most of these young people hoping to work and study fail, and some even face the danger of going hungry. Of course, among those hoping to work and study, some do achieve their goals, but even if they fully succeed, in reality they only achieve "half-study," still failing to satisfy their desire for knowledge. Therefore, survival and knowledge, these two great desires, are currently unfulfilled for most young people. The conflict between belly and brain is irreconcilable for most young people in the current situation.</p>
<p>Survival is certainly more important than knowledge. When young people cannot afford to nourish both belly and brain at the same time, they have no choice but to strive for the sake of the belly. As a result, the struggle for human survival becomes more acute, and the many absurd, despicable, and cruel phenomena produced in this struggle increase daily. Whose fault is this? Who should be responsible for this? I say: from the conflict between belly and brain existing in the average young person, to their abandonment of the brain and sole focus on the belly, all these phenomena are caused by "poverty" under the current social system.</p>

<h3 id="e355">Little Master Gets a Haircut <a href="#e355" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c355" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">355</a></h3>
<p>— Bi</p>
<p>Apprentice</p>
<p>Heavens! You're deliberately going against me, making my hair grow so fast: long and fluffy, looking like…a mess, really ugly.</p>
<p>The hair just keeps growing, but my pockets don't grow a single copper. What can I do? Just let it grow forever!</p>
<p>My neck is strained and sore. I've been eagerly waiting until the fifteenth, rushing to collect my wages—a colorful banknote. Don't misunderstand; it's not a hundred-yuan bill, or even ten or five, but a one-yuan bill. Ha! How amusing! Stuffed in my pocket, it makes my chest puff out a bit.</p>
<p>Hair is long, nothing to be done. I have to visit the barbershop. A perfectly good banknote disappears into the tobacconist's counter, turning into six double-dime coins and a dozen coppers. I keep looking around on the way, wondering which barbershop is more economical. Slowly walking to the bridge at the Tianhou Temple, I glimpse a barbershop by the roadside, but the magnificent decoration at the entrance scares me off. Let's go; this isn't my destination.</p>
<p>I can't find one by going further. I have no choice but to go back to that barbershop to check the price list. It probably won't be too</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>expensive! So I returned along the same route. When I arrived at the barbershop, the gold-lettered sign "×××" caught my eye, but I couldn't find the price list. "Let's see what the interior looks like first," I thought.</p>
<p>"Hey! Come in, sit inside." I had barely poked my head in when they greeted me with civilized kidnapping, forcing me to bite the bullet and go in, then figure it out. Wow! Look at the dazzling electric lights, the shiny floors, electric blow-dryers, face massages, and some other unnameable gadgets. The aroma is as strong as the stench in a toilet. Those getting haircuts are pot-bellied gentlemen, smartly dressed young men... The attendants are solicitous, offering tea, wiping hats... I feel like Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden, embarrassed to the extreme, my face burning, my heart uneasy, just beating irregularly.</p>
<p>"Little master, what style of haircut?"</p>
<p>"Rounded top, just so-so, quick..." I touched the six double-dime coins in my pocket, really worried: "If he wants more than a yuan, I'm in trouble. Bad luck running into this place. If I tell him to do it just so-so, maybe he'll charge less?"</p>
<p>"Ha! Just so-so..." He spoke to someone else in a Jiangbei accent, the rest of the words unclear. At the same time, he gave a sinister smile that stabbed my weak soul. My already uneasy heart, further stimulated, beat almost abnormally, my breathing seemed difficult, my head was dizzy, my face burning. Ah! I can't take it. I really want to run away.</p>
<p>How anxious my heart is! Touching the six double-dimes in my pocket, I really resent myself, banging my head, wondering how I ended up here. I hesitated: should I give him twenty cents, or forty, or sixty...? Thinking about giving him more, I really don't want to; a month's hard work, only exchanged for a yuan. Giving him less, what if he makes it difficult for me? Finally, my head was cut. I finally decided to take out twenty cents. My hands were shaking, and all the blood in my body seemed to return to my heart at once. Without looking back, I ran away in a puff of smoke. On the road, I took a deep breath, touched the silver coins in my pocket, and couldn't help but laugh a little.</p>
<h3 id="e356">After Having a Family <a href="#e356" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c356" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">356</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yizhai</p>
<p>Electrician</p>
<p>Electricians in China today are considered to be among the better-paid workers. They only work eight hours a day, and the average monthly salary is thirty yuan. They also have regular holidays on Sundays, and I am such a worker. In China's labor force today, I can be considered one of the luckiest. But precisely because of this, my problem arises under these circumstances. At first, because my livelihood was guaranteed, I felt comforted. Also, because of the novelty of the environment, my spirits were maintained, so every day going to and from work, eating at the mess hall, going home to sleep, and sleeping in a bit on Sunday mornings before whiling away the day—this monotonous, mechanical life didn't feel bitter. Unexpectedly, after two or three months, as I met more friends, the situation changed. Seeing the joy of those with families, comforting each other, I felt very envious. At twenty-four, the prime of youth, and with a relatively stable life, I naturally couldn't escape the universal rule of "food and sex." This aroused another kind of need in my spirit and body, making me feel often depressed. However, poaching, visiting prostitutes, and the syphilis specimens in the windows of VD clinics had already scared away my courage. So I focused my thoughts on solving the problem entirely on getting married. Once I had this idea in mind, my spirit changed immediately. When eating at the mess hall, I thought, if I had a wife, I could cook my own meals. Two people cooking for themselves wouldn't necessarily be more expensive than one person eating at the mess hall. When going home to sleep, I thought, isn't living alone in a room the same as living with two people? If I had a wife, I definitely wouldn't have to work so hard and not even have someone to talk to, which is so desolate! Moreover, having a wife can save on laundry and sewing expenses, and it doesn't necessarily increase the burden one-sidedly. Especially on Sundays, those short-lived Sundays, I'm so bored at home. Seeing the strange sights of men and women on the streets of Shanghai, which everyone can see, makes me even more uneasy. At this point, I really think about getting married all the time. What stimulated me the most to make a decision was the difficulty of asking the landlord to open the door when I came home late after playing with friends. He clearly heard me, but pretended not to, making me wait at least half an hour. When he finally opened the door, his unhappy face and the rambling idle talk in his mouth were really unbearable. Then I thought, if I had a wife, I wouldn't be like this!</p>
<p>Now I have a wife! And I have a child! But the happiness is not as I imagined in the past. On the contrary, I feel a new kind of pain. Every time I work, I think about how dangerous it is to play with electricity. If I die because of it, and my wife is tied down by the child and can't work, how will they live? Rely on the compensation? It's very limited, and the capitalists are trying to get rid of it. Every time I come home from work, my body is extremely tired, and I easily get annoyed. But my wife is also tired from household chores and piecework she does at home brought in by others. Her mood may not be good either. So, for her to cook, I have to hold the baby, or if the baby happens to be asleep and she's cooking, I have to fetch things and put them away. In this process, if I slack off a little or do it a little slower, she'll scold me, I'll say something back to her, and we'll start arguing. At this time, I have this feeling in my heart: how happy it is to go to the mess hall after work! Home is really hell. And secretly I still complain to my wife: "You're tired because there are you and the child at home, not just for me. My grievance now is really indescribable. Without you and the child, I can barely get by financially. I don't even have to help cook after I've worked." Of course, this is my one-sided reason. On my wife's side, isn't she also full of tears with nowhere to shed them! Thinking like this, I immediately make a conclusion: poor people simply shouldn't have families, so they don't suffer while alive, and don't die with their eyes unclosed. But then I think: there are many poor people in the world, and very few rich people. If all poor people don't want families, won't humanity be extinct in a few years? Therefore, I feel that this is a fundamental and major problem in modern society.</p>

<p>Alleyway College Student</p>
<p>There is a special kind of person in Shanghai, namely, those who do not live in schools but live in the gatehouses or front buildings of alleyways on both sides of the road, living a "student life." Most of these people are unemployed and can be classified as vagrants. But because they were originally students, and haven't lost their "student demeanor" even though they now live in alleyways, some amusing people call them "alleyway college students."</p>
<p>Naturally, "alleyway college students" are mostly very "poor." But generally speaking, they all understand art very well, as can be proven by the arrangement of their houses. In their small gatehouse or front building, you can see an iron bed leaning diagonally in the corner of the room; a writing desk is also placed diagonally, facing the iron bed; next to the writing desk is inevitably a bookshelf, neatly arranged with some foreign books; the floor is</p>
<p>▲ Important text continues on page five ▲</p>

<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>scrubbed shiny; photos of movie stars are nailed to the most conspicuous place in the room; cooking utensils are inevitably placed in an inconspicuous place, because these things are not pretty; if they can still pawn a pair of pants, they must buy a bunch of fresh flowers to put in a vase, and when the breeze passes, you can smell a pleasant fragrance… In this way, although it is a small gatehouse or front building, after their "artistic" arrangement, it becomes very elegant.</p>
<p>"Alleyway college students" mostly cook their own meals, which is said to be based on hygiene. However, there is a difficulty here, namely, since they cook their own meals, they must buy their own groceries. Under the scrutiny of everyone, it is such a shameful thing to carry a grocery basket to buy groceries as a "college student"! This requires another clever solution. So, when the clever "alleyway college students" go to buy groceries, they don't carry a grocery basket, but secretly take a few newspapers to wrap the purchased groceries and bring them back. In this way, they are not afraid of being laughed at, because walking on the road carrying a package wrapped in a newspaper, no one can tell that this is someone returning from buying groceries. In buying groceries, they also have many "romantic anecdotes," such as telling jokes to the tofu-selling girl, touching other people's young mistresses, etc.; however, the most popular among them is that they often like to secretly touch the buttocks of "pretty" girls when people are crowded, which is said to relieve the monotonous life.</p>
<p>"Alleyway college students," like students studying in schools, besides reading books and writing articles from time to time, always like to hum a few lines of Peking Opera, play a few rounds of mahjong, or watch movies and gamble in their spare time. However, these are not their main characteristics. Their main characteristic is that they love to boast. They often get a little news from here and go there to boast; at the same time, they hear new news from there and come here to talk about it; no matter where, as long as they start bragging, they talk endlessly and wildly; they can brag from international politics to the life of a certain writer, to the eyes and thighs of a certain lady, to everything; if it were not for the need to eat and sleep, they could really finish bragging about all the problems of the universe and life, which of course has no time limit.</p>
<p>If you are happy and want to ask what the hopes of "alleyway college students" are, then I can tell you: they have many and great hopes. They hope for victory in the Anti-Japanese War, they hope for the success of the revolution,… but their most immediate hope is: that family or relatives and friends send money quickly, and that their lovers write letters!</p>
<p>Discourse on Occupations</p>
<h3 id="e359">Occupation and Occupational Interest <a href="#e359" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c359" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">359</a></h3>
<p>— Pang Chengqi</p>
<p>Man is a member of society, and occupation is a unit of social organization. The relationship between people and society is directly linked to the relationship between each occupation and people.</p>
<p>In a society, if every member has a considerable interest in his or her own occupation, then naturally he or she will work hard and pursue the occupation in which he or she can find interest. However, in the vortex of contradictions in the modern social system, it is not uncommon for an engineering graduate to be a clerk, or for an agriculturalist to be a history teacher... What is the reason for this? The simple answer is: to seek personal survival.</p>
<p>Most people treat occupation only as a means of livelihood. Here, livelihood means having enough to eat. The oppression of all material life and the threat of hunger force everyone to endure extreme pain in an occupational life that does not match their interests.</p>
<p>But everything should have a proper solution. We certainly cannot say that a person can pursue passionate dreams without eating, nor can we just wait for the world we need to arrive. Therefore, in this uninteresting, even detestable, occupation, there should be some practical remedies.</p>
<p>The best thing to do, of course, is to find an occupation that matches one's interests again, but this is absolutely impossible for most people. Therefore, the first thing we need to do is to examine our own occupation and see how it relates to society. If the relationship is close, even meaningful, then we must examine ourselves in detail and try to make our interests subordinate to the occupation for a meaningful cause, and learn in this environment, waiting for the useful days to come.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the occupation has no meaning to society, then, in order to avoid being eliminated in the future, we must learn other things in the possible scope outside of the occupation, strive according to our own interests, and prepare to run into a new life. Of course, for the sake of the present life, we cannot temporarily give up the occupation that we have no interest in, for the sake of life!</p>
<p>Let's end with two sentences: learn inside and outside of occupation, struggle in the circle of life!</p>

<h3 id="e360">A "Good People Government" Style of Good People School <a href="#e360" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c360" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">360</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Si</p>
<p>Just as the bread problem is about to be solved, unfortunately, because one has studied for a few years, a panic about the desire for knowledge arises again. Under the current economic system, these two problems are closely related to money. Therefore, poor fellows "cannot have both," and can only temporarily give up the latter for the former. However, "having obtained Shu, one desires Long" is a common human psychology. Food and clothing can solve physical hunger, but knowledge can heal spiritual hunger. Initially, I bought some books to look up and read, but as time went on, I felt that "studying alone without friends" leads to "doing twice the work for half the result." Moreover, specialized techniques such as arithmetic formulas must be taught by a teacher. Therefore, I longed for the school gates.</p>
<p>Balancing bread and education, I had to look for part-time night schools. However, I had no experience in finding schools and could only ask friends to help me find one. Eventually, I achieved my goal. According to the introducer, this is the best-known school in the city because it is "×-affiliated." Although the × character didn't shock me, I thought to myself, "Since it's the best-known, the professors must be well-learned scholars, right?" So I resolutely signed up.</p>
<p>Tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, lecture fees, report fees... all paid, and I was admitted to the school without encountering any difficulties. Paying "fees" for admission is the norm for all schools these days, isn't it? I thought.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am too naive? Why do others think it's normal, but I always feel something is wrong and can't help but be surprised.</p>
<p>The first impression that made me feel strange was the office staff preparing for the school opening, who were extraordinarily busy with student registration, enrollment, payment of fees, and so on, so that the school opening was delayed by two weeks. Three or four weeks after classes started, I received a mimeographed schedule, and we had to revise it repeatedly, so much so that we had to rewrite it ourselves. Under my hopeful belief at the time, I explained it this way: "This is the business of the office staff, fortunately, it has nothing to do with the teachers..."</p>
<p>But then came the second impression. The school's professors seemed to be too busy to be separated. Every night, there were two or three notices posted saying, "Mr. So-and-so is on leave due to ××, and the ×× class is temporarily suspended." The so-called temporary suspension is actually a permanent suspension. There were also temporary (?) incidents that were not notified to the academic affairs department, so it was common to encounter missing classes even without a leave notice. Experienced students, when faced with this kind of thing, would usually wait five minutes and then scatter like birds and beasts, wasting time, wasting transportation costs, and making a wasted trip... all of which were "commonplace" and not taken seriously. But, "Why are the professors so casual about teaching?" After careful inquiries, an old classmate explained to me: "What's so difficult to understand? Three and a half dollars per class, and deducted if you miss one! What's the big deal! And the school can save a few classes' worth of tuition!"</p>
<p>The professor, nicknamed "Good Person," walked into the classroom with a tofu-sized piece of paper in his right hand and a roll book under his left arm, always with a smile. He glanced at the whole room and began to call the roll, calling out "Miss Ter ×, Miss Ter ×..." This took three minutes. "Teacher, you called it wrong, she's Miss, not Miss Ter!" Little Zhang pointed to a female classmate and said. "Oh, I always forget, I must correct it next time." Then there was a burst of laughter. Then, from the weather to women's clothing, he spent another ten to twenty minutes before he began to copy the manuscript onto the blackboard. The characters were large and the board was small. After filling the entire blackboard, he would pause and wait for everyone to copy it into their notebooks before explaining it item by item. "It's true! What the teacher says always matches the written words exactly," one student said. "Oh..." This was the teacher's reply. But the teacher also knew that his time was lacking, so he pulled out some "Foreign countries are like this, I used to be like this in New York..." After class, I counted, a total of thirteen items were copied, one hundred and fifty or sixty words, and these copied outlines seemed to be imaginable even without reference books.</p>
<p>One day, after class, I gently said to "Good Person," "Teacher, why don't you give the prepared lectures to the academic affairs department for mimeographing and distribution? This way, everyone can save effort, and the teacher will have enough time to explain." "Don't you know? I also teach at some other schools, and I'm extremely busy... These lectures are all temporarily excerpted five minutes before class!" I admired his honesty and therefore forgave his difficulties, but I thought to myself, "Unfortunately, you have saved the school four dollars per person for lecture fees again."</p>
<p>"Good Person's" absences ranked first in the school. Statistics show that illness accounted for two-thirds of the reasons, and there were many laughable reasons for other incidents. Once, in class, students asked as usual: "Teacher, why didn't you come last time?" "Oh, I took the tram and was halfway there when a friend, Mr. So-and-so, said to me, 'Today is the ×× anniversary, why are you rushing to class?' I thought for a moment, 'Forget it,' and then..." "Why didn't you call the school? We were like 'idiots waiting for their wives'..." There was another burst of laughter. However, he never encountered student opposition or any strikes because he had two weapons. In addition to never getting angry, the most important thing was leniency during various exams.</p>
<p>Of course, there were more than just the above-mentioned things that made my belief in school drop from boiling point to freezing point. As someone who has never stepped into the gates of a university in my life, I couldn't help but be surprised, and I now believe that the university life described in novels is not entirely fictional.</p>
<p>Someone said, "Society is a university. You don't have to go to school to study, and you can only obtain true knowledge by throwing yourself into society." There is nothing wrong with that. I can only drop out of school and turn to society to work hard and explore. But, you must know that I do monotonous things every day for bread. The environment is simple and boring, and I deal with cunning merchants. What can you learn from that? Alas! Prosperous city, I now know that in your embrace, not only is bread difficult to find, but you cannot fully supply the emptiness of knowledge. You are just an embroidered pillow!</p>
<h3 id="e361">Part-time Correspondence Reading Group <a href="#e361" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c361" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">361</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Jie</p>
<p>Nowadays, it is very difficult for store employees, especially apprentices like us, to acquire other knowledge in their spare time. We often encounter problems that we cannot explain when studying on our own, and there is simply no way to solve them. Previously, this magazine! Part-time Weekly! A certain gentleman proposed organizing a reading group, but its content cannot be suitable for our group of old-fashioned store apprentices; because old-fashioned store apprentices have no time to go out all year round except for a few days of the Lunar New Year. Under such circumstances, the proposal of "Part-time Correspondence Reading Group" was born.</p>
<p>Our method is to use the spirit of mutual assistance to conduct mutual research and exploration, and to answer questions by correspondence. In this way, we can not only increase our knowledge, but also make more friends, and even all apprentices are our closest friends.</p>
<p>The above is our proposal. As for all organizational regulations, they still need future members to express their opinions and discuss and formulate them. Those who wish to join, please send a letter to Tian Cheng Xiang Zhu Shop, No. 7 Xinbeimenkou, for transfer to Qian Xiaoxia, or to Hu Renling, Zhongxi Shanghao, No. 341 Guangxi Road, Nanjing Road.</p>

<h3 id="e362">Egg Suspended in Water <a href="#e362" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c362" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">362</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Xilin</p>
<p>丨One of the Scientific Games丨</p>
<p>This is a physically interesting trick. We can play it in our spare time. It costs nothing, and we can also get an important principle of physics from it. Now I will write it down below:</p>
<p>(1) Required items: one fresh egg, one tall and wide glass bottle, filled with clear water (cold water), and one bag of salt.</p>
<p>(2) Method: First, put the egg into the bottle. Because the egg is heavier than water, it sinks to the bottom of the bottle. Now, gradually add a little salt to the water, and stir the water at the same time to dissolve the salt evenly. When the salt is added to the appropriate amount, the egg will completely obey your command. You lift it up and place it in the center of the bottle. Just take your hand away, and it will still stand still. If you raise it or lower it again, it will also obey your orders and dare not move without permission.</p>
<p>(3) Reason: Because the specific gravity of the egg is greater than that of clear water, the egg sinks. Adding salt to the water turns the clear water into salt water. The specific gravity of salt water is greater than that of clear water. The more salt is added, the greater the specific gravity. When the specific gravity of salt water and clear water are equal, the egg will neither float nor sink, and will stay in the middle of the water. If you add more salt to make the specific gravity of the salt water greater than that of the egg, the egg will float on the water surface.</p>
<p>(4) Additional note: We know that east of the city of Jerusalem, there is a saltwater lake called the Dead Sea. The water there contains 25% salt, and its specific gravity is particularly large. No matter who goes there, they can swim safely.</p>

<p>Characters: Police Officer, Undercover Agent, Unemployed Person, Spectators, Inspecting Officer, Another Police Officer.</p>
<p>Time: × Year × Month × Day, After New Year.</p>
<p>Location: Dockside.</p>
<p>Setting: In the center of the stage is a lamppost, on which hangs a rectangular glass cabinet, with the words "Lifesaver, Do Not Open Unless It Is An Emergency" written on the glass. Around it are piled some loading boxes. The undercover agent and the police officer appear together.</p>
<p>Undercover Agent: (To the police officer) Keep an eye on that side. There are a lot of people over there. It must be them. Damn it...</p>
<p>…　…Police Officer: (Looks around) Are they really going to fight? What about the foreigners? I really can't figure it out.</p>
<p>Undercover Agent: Humph, just wait and see. They are definitely going to have some kind of parade, shouting down something. Those stupid guys, there must be someone stirring up trouble inside. I don't believe in this so-called imperialism.</p>
<p>Police Officer: But...</p>
<p>Undercover Agent: "But" what? Are you going to go crazy with them?</p>
<p>Police Officer: That's not what I mean. I think they are really suffering too much. Didn't you hear them say yesterday that they paid the comprador 600 yuan in deposit to get a job as a fireman. Now that the comprador doesn't need them anymore, he's telling them to get lost. Is that reasonable?</p>
<p>Undercover Agent: That's just the fireman's fault. If it were me, I wouldn't have gotten that kind of job. How much is your salary per month?</p>
<p>Police Officer: Alas, it's not good, eight silver dollars, and I have to eat on my own. Recently, I'm still owed...</p>
<p>Undercover Agent: (Rather proudly) We get a regular salary of forty dollars, and there's a bonus for each case we handle; our bosses, I don't know how much more they get than us. (Suddenly whispers in the police officer's ear) That guy coming over there looks suspicious. You keep an eye on him, I'll go over there for a while and come back. (Saying this, he goes to the lower left) Maybe you'll have good luck.</p>
<p>Unemployed Person: (Appearing on stage in tattered clothes and a haggard appearance) Humph, (Speaking to himself) There's no business at the dock either... Yesterday, the day before yesterday, the day before the day before yesterday, a month, five months, it's been almost half a year since I had anything to do. I've been hungry for months, my wife, and her dog-raised little children. Alas, forget it, what's the point of living? (Walks to the riverside, stares for a while, the police officer is watching him strangely. After watching for a while, he turns around and looks around, preparing to lift his clothes and jump into the water)</p>
<p>Police Officer: (Coughs loudly)</p>
<p>Unemployed Person: (Startled by the police officer's cough, doesn't jump, turns around and takes a step or two, muttering in his mouth) The police are really the most hateful thing. When you want to live, they will beat you with a mourning stick; when you want to die, they will drag you back... (With a kind of nervous laugh) Hahahaha... (The laughter suddenly stops, he is already standing in front of the lamppost of the "Lifesaver", rubs his eyes, and looks at the words in surprise, slowly reading) Lifesaver, Do Not Open Unless It Is An Emergency! Ah, I'm saved! I'm saved! (As if crazy, shouting, he immediately raises his fist and hits the glass cabinet, with a loud bang, the glass breaks. At this time, the police officer has run behind him, grabs his collar and drags him, he takes two steps backward, his hand is cut by the glass, stained with blood.)</p>
<p>Police Officer: What are you doing? (The unemployed person is furious, thinking that he is going to grab his lifesaver, so he rushes towards the police officer, and the two of them twist into a ball, and people gradually gather to watch the fun. Finally, the unemployed person is pinned to the ground due to lack of strength, and the police officer blows his police whistle frantically. The previous undercover agent runs over)</p>
<p>Undercover Agent: (Saying to the police officer in a joking tone) You really got lucky. (Lifts his bloated "ham" and kicks the unemployed person hard) Damn you, dare you still stir up trouble?</p>
<p>Police Officer: (Stands aside, the unemployed person struggles to get up) It's not stirring up trouble, (Points to the lifesaver cabinet) It's hitting that thing. (The spectators laugh)</p>
<p>Undercover Agent: (Looking a little embarrassed) Ah, what? It's not stirring up trouble? (The inspecting officer comes with another police officer)</p>
<p>Inspecting Officer: What's the matter?</p>
<p>Police Officer: (Stands at attention, raises his hand) Report, this person broke the lifesaver and wanted to escape, I caught him.</p>
<p>Inspecting Officer: (Walks to the unemployed person) Why did you break that thing?</p>
<p>Unemployed Person: (Bluntly) I want to save my life!… (The inspecting officer and the rest of the people are startled)</p>
<p>Inspecting Officer: How can it save your life?</p>
<p>Unemployed Person: Isn't it written clearly on it? "Do Not Open Unless It Is An Emergency." I've been hungry for days, I haven't had a job for more than five months, I still have a wife and son, isn't that an emergency? (People laugh when they hear this) This police officer even wanted to grab mine.</p>
<p>Inspecting Officer: (Suppressing his laughter) You broke public property, and you dare to beat public officials, (To a police officer) Take him back to the station!</p>
<p>Unemployed Person: (Pitifully) I didn't commit a crime, sir, I want to save my own life!…</p>
<p>Inspecting Officer: (Gets angry) Go! Won't you go? (Slaps him. The unemployed person lowers his head and says nothing, and follows the police officer away. In the distance, there are shouts from the crowd: "Everyone go on the ship!" "We want our 600 yuan back!" The inspecting officer, the police officer, and the undercover agent rush to the place where the sound is coming from, the curtain closes.)</p>

<p>— Jing</p>
<p>In the previous issues of this magazine, Mr. Tao Wenlong listed eight international specialized Esperanto organizations, but according to my knowledge, the following organizations have not been included, so I have made a "supplement."</p>
<p>"Global Esperanto Association of the Blind" The address is in Sweden and publishes an Esperanto bulletin.</p>
<p>"International Esperanto Law Scholars Association" The address is in Poland.</p>
<p>"Business Esperanto League" The address is in Germany and publishes an Esperanto bulletin "Business."</p>
<p>"Global Federation of Opticians and Ophthalmologists" The address is in London and publishes an Esperanto bulletin.</p>
<p>"International Police Association" The address is in Germany and publishes an Esperanto bulletin.</p>
<p>"Buddhist Esperanto Association" The address is in the UK and publishes an Esperanto bulletin "Buddhism."</p>
<p>"International Christian Esperanto Union" The address is in Germany.</p>
<p>"Boy Scout Esperanto Union" The address is in the UK and publishes an Esperanto "Boy Scout Bulletin."</p>
