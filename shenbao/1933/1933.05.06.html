<h3 id="c1">吾人對於農村復興之希望寂 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>如何復興中國農村。此一問題。最近頗引起國人嚴重之注意。政府當局今有復興農村委員會之設立。各方關於此一問題之討論。亦囂然並起。月前本報讀者顧問欄偶因揭載關於此一問題之通訊。即引起讀者熱烈之討論。發表者僅十之一。歷時逾月。由此可知此問題在今日。其嚴重性實已剌激任何人之意識而迫切求一解答。</p>
<p>今日中國農村。果如何而後可以復興乎。吾人以爲凡求解决甘一問題首必把握其中心。我國今日農村之癥結果安在乎。此應分内在的外來的二方面言之。外來的原因。即國際資本主義勢力之侵入。傾銷大批農産品。二十一年度輸入額。達三萬四千八百五十九萬餘海關兩。此方面之源因。　擱置不言。至於内在的原因。則連年内亂。水旱頻仍。苛捐雜稅。日增靡已。亦皆爲顯明之事實。如蘇常一帶。農民之家。大都無三日之糧。陜西大荒旱之後。苛捐雜稅。匪但未减輕。且日有增加。更有甚者。最近四川田賦。已征至民國六十年。此次以勦赤爲名。增征四千萬凡此實例。俯拾即是。其他倍於此者。尤更僕難數。此則我國今日農村内在致病之根本原因也。故今日不言農村救濟則已。如曰救濟。則首應從剷除此種種根本致病之原因入手。換言之。即最低限度。應使政治淸明。社會安定。必如是後始可以言復興農村之端緒。此爲今日言農村救濟之第一要義。</p>
<p>尤有進者。吾人今日希望政府對於復興農村第一必須有一整個之計劃。與施行之步驟。蓋復興農村之工作。與交通水利等息息相關。換言之。即復興農村。不過爲整個政治之一端。　使整個政治。而不有澄。淸則空談復興。於事何補。今人或艶羨蘇聯農業工業化之成功。然而春所以致此。則亦由於整個五年計劃。在整個計劃之下。各個部門平衡發展。相輔相助。而農凿之工業化。乃克底　成。其故蓋可深長思也。</p>
<p>其次。政府今日旣已有農村復興委員會之設立。則尤必具有努力實行復興方策之决心。曩者政府於國民會議　。曾制定農業政策實施綱領。其要點爲奬勵農産。發展林業。興辦水利。提倡農村合作。改良農民生活等。莫不爲救濟農村之要圖。二年來虹能切實遵行。固未嘗不可收復興農村之效。顧此項綱領頒布後。事實則安在。是以吾人今日不貴能言。尤　能行。今日復興農村委員會之設立。其意義重要。　　過於　者。而吾人不免於鰓鰓過慮者。誠懼其不幸而仍蹈襲曩昔每會决而不行之覆轍耳。此外復興會應多聘專家。不</p>
<p>在羅致「聞人。一實事求是。亦爲今日之要務。</p>
<p>最後。一國有一國之經濟背景絶不能以一例概其餘。今日美國之農村恐</p>
<p>慌與我國之農村恐慌。絶不相同。彼之生産爲無政府狀態。産品過剩。而又分配不均。農村之恐慌。乃緣是而起。今美政府竭盡全力。以圖挽救。雖其能否挽救此狂瀾尙未可知。惟美國政治之安寗。與經濟力之雄厚。比之吾國。則不可以同日而語。吾國今日之病。旣因政治不定。社會摇動。農民經濟困苦。又達極點。則美國之救濟方法。是否適用於吾國。資本主義國家救濟農村之方策。吾國是否可以倣效。此又吾人不能不請政府注意於本國今日之實際狀况。而細心考量者也。</p>

<p>（南京）　中央五日晨八時舉行革命政府成立紀念大會、到中委葉楚傖、孫科·戴傳賢·石瑛·陳立夫·黄慕松·馬超俊·鄭占南·戴愧生·謝作民·谷正綱·苗培成·鄧家彦·等、及全體職員各機關代表、共約六百餘人、奏樂開會、由孫科主席、領導行禮如儀、並由孫科即席報告、原詞如下、各位同志、今天是革命政府、成立第十二年紀念日、紀念總理在廣州就任非常大總統職、我們今天紀念革命政府成立、不能不回想過去從民國十年至十三年四年中間革命政府在廣州奮鬥經過的歷史、民國十年、北洋軍閥曹吳當國、把持中國政權、摧殘革命勢力、總理爲貫澈革命的目的起見、從上海回到廣州、當時一部份國會議員跟着總理也回到廣州、總理回到廣州以後、因爲要樹立革命中心力量以對内對外的正式最高機關來維持革命運動、所以主張從速建立革命政府、當時主持廣東一省者、就是陳炯明、殊不知陳炯明彼時巳與曹吳勾結、暗中反對在廣州成立革命政府、陳逆雖然這樣反對、而總理爲貫澈革命主張起見、乃於十年五月五日舉行就任非常大總統職典禮、我們還記得革命政府成立的那一天、廣州幾十萬民衆參加大遊行、很熱烈表示贊同、革命政府成立以後、總理積極籌備出師北伐、當時因爲陳炯明在廣東暗中破壞革命運動、所以到了是年秋季、總理率領一部份軍隊、及其他各省同志到廣西之桂林、作爲大本營、預備出師湖南、後來總理知道廣東内部不穩、深恐陳炯明要投降北洋軍閥、所以决定由桂林回師廣州鎭壓、民國十一年總理回廣州、預備由廣東出兵江西、當時陳炯明表面上雖表示服從、而實際上已積極反抗、所以不等到總理回來、而陳炯明自己表示下野、免去本兼各職、且離開廣州、表示不預聞北伐運動、陳炯明離開總理以後、暗中仍不斷的積極反抗、到了是年六月十六日、在廣州竟叛變了而致總理蒙難、十一年八月、總理回到上海、同時命令廣西各軍移師東下驅逐陳逆、十一年冬天、大軍從西江發動時、果把逆軍擊潰、民國十二年、總理又回到廣東、重行組織大本營、繼續北伐任務、民國十二年至十三年革命政府在廣東所處的地位、是最困難、因爲當時革命的勢力祇及廣州一市、東江有陳逆盤據、其他北江西江亦不受革命政府命令的、當時革命力量祇有靠廣州一隅的地方來維持、同時革命政府因爲要抵抗北洋軍閥、截留廣東關稅、便引起帝國主義者反抗、英國助北洋軍閥向革命政府交涉、並派軍艦來威嚇、同時勾結廣州商團做成一種反動的力量、想把革命政府傾覆、當時革命政府在廣州經過很困難的奮鬥、才能夠把種種反動勞力消滅、總理北上以後、廣東反動力量也就次第消滅、我們回想革命政府成立之後、幾年來這一種困難奮鬥的歷史、比之我們今天黨國所處的地位、更爲危難、我們不能不繼承總理大無　精神、向前奮鬥、我們一般同志自從九一八以來因爲受日本帝國主義這一種侵略壓迫、同時因爲國内不能團結一致、對外常常發生悲觀、以爲黨國沒有出路、前途似乎是很黑暗的、兄弟以爲現在我們所處的環境、固然困難、但在此時的困難、還比不上總理在廣州時的困難、現在國内的政權、還操之於本黨掌握中、我們巳有政治軍事等種種力量、不能說困難太多而不能打開局面、我們只要能夠恢復總理在廣州成立革命政府組織革命運動這一種大無長精神而發揚光大之、什麽一切困難、都可以打破、所以我們今天紀念革命政府成立、就要恢復總理的革命精神、要鞏固革命勢力、集中全國民衆革命的力量、對外抵抗帝國主義者的侵略、對内肅淸破壞革命戰線一切的惡勢力、使國家民族能夠繼續生存、使革命使命能夠依據總理遺敎完成、這是我們大家同志今天紀念總理在廣州成立革命政府、應該有决心來擔當今後重大責任、（五日中央社電）</p>

<p>據世界電訊金融主筆亨特考德詳細調查、銀行家對於政府近日措施之意見、大多數以爲迄今聯邦政府之參加各業出於不得已、故政府輒表示其力圖擺脫之願望、因此若輩信目前之趨勢、政府猶贊助現有之資本制度、其欲聆政府政策者、乃希望徴實此種見解並非有所懷疑云、</p>

<p>多倫失守的前後本報特派員國安</p>
<p>這次本館派我觀察的目的地、就是無論如何到多倫爲終點、所以我就在四百餘里的沙原上、兜了一個半圜形的圈子、在四月二十五日到達多倫、不用說在那闊大的蒙城裏、作了一次很迅速的巡禮、卒於又離開這朝不保夕的多倫、那知道我們所認爲敵人攻擊目標的多倫、就在僞軍蒙匪猛攻之下、而於四月二十九日夜失陷、那麽在這裏、我只得把沿路的視察的程序、顚倒一下、先報告一些多倫的情形吧、</p>
<p>多倫原名呌多倫諾爾、蒙古話多倫是「七」、諾爾是「水池」、不用說我們知道多倫附近有七個不大不小的水池子、但牠在察哈爾省境内、是北邊一個重要的蒙古城、不但是佛敎的中心、也是蒙古人商業的中心、我到了多倫城、所看到的是兩個黄墻綠瓦的大寺院、一個是前淸康煕勅建的彚宗寺、那一個是雍正勅建的善因寺、建築的宏偉壯觀、在内地是看不見的、我問那懂話的喇嘛說、裏面住有活佛、不但能知前身的身世、而且對于目前的戰事、也沒有在意、</p>
<p>我所看到的商店、在這時多半是門前冷落、關門大吉、據說城裏製造大小銅佛、是精巧而密緻、西藏外蒙古所供的銅佛、都是多倫的出産、城裏我看見的蒙古人和喇嘛除外、是着軍服的騎步兵、趙承綬旅佈置在多倫城内附近、但用軍事眼光來看、多倫東百餘里處、有山嶺起伏、（蟒牛泡子）足爲防守者的天險、軍隊裏的人說、那裏老早就築有陣地、甚爲堅固、假設那個地方不守、則多倫只好拱手讓人、我本打算到蟒牛泡子去看一趟、因爲行路難而汽車不便、只好放棄這段心思、蒙古人日常所用的必需品、布疋·鞋帽·米麵·等、都得到多倫來購買、在這裏國家收入的機關、有塞北關·蒙鹽局·統捐局·菸酒稅局·電報局·所以一向就有小庫倫的稱號、實在是察東的重鎭、按照地理上來講、多倫西北約七十里、有座昭蘇乃木城、城分内外三道、就是元朝時的上都城、是元朝未入北京以前的都城、位置在閃電河右岸、閃電河也就是元時的上都河、兩岸平原千里、水草肥美而適於屯駐大量的騎砲兵、在歷史上看、這是應當注意的、此外還有駱駝山的軍馬牧塲、關係軍馬補充、尤爲重要、</p>
<p>再談交通方面、除長途電話和電報外、作輸送的有兩種工具、一種是大車和牛車、由張家口經汗諾爾壩·什八爾台·沽源·等處到多倫、一種是汽車、由張家口經萬全壩·張北縣·馬拉格廟·到多倫、夏秋間一日可到、不過汗諾爾壩和萬全壩、眞要作軍事上用、路面須擴大、傾斜甚急的斜坡、都須修理、在這軍事倥惚不得巳時、駱駝隊也可以補助運輸、</p>
<p>多倫是國内的同胞所最注意的地方、我雖然在多倫擔擱的時間少、但關於多倫的防守一切上、都要盡量的採取、報告給讀者、在這裏我並不是因爲多倫陷落、我在遠處說風凉話、可是據我見到的多倫的駐軍以及防禦的準備、根本就沒有把　、蟒牛泡子的守軍、第一樣缺乏運輸汽車、何况大多數是騎兵、號有義勇軍馮占海部改編的步兵、據我知道的、在多倫東面的並不多、按着戰鬭原則來講、騎兵根本就不能作頑强的抵抗防禦的能力、那麽我由多倫回來時、老早心裏就想到、敵如來攻、在他們的戰略的佈置上、就得………、</p>
<p>在馮占海軍部的時候、就聽到蒙匪千餘名、内裏混合着僞軍千餘、由多倫的西北的方向、有南下模樣、馮軍長接到密探報告、蒙匪巳抵石大房子北三十華里之某村、（距滿德堂約五六十里）當時馮軍長他說、假設這一點蒙匪、眞要來是敢擔保送死、因爲在這在右百里内、（指囗囗囗囗囗說）都是我們六十三軍、和新改編騎兵二十四·二十五·兩旅、那時我點點頭、只好相信這兩千蒙匪不要緊、那知道過了兩天、多倫被劉桂堂逆部和蒙匪鮮軍攻下、</p>
<p>在那官樣的電報裏、我看到是僞逆雜軍、由圍塲·錐子山·前進攻蟒牛泡子·敵步兵千餘名、並附機關槍山砲坦克車·裝甲車、編隊飛機、我官兵奮力抵抗、最終繼之以肉搏結果不支紛退、同時在多倫城内還發生了一次最壯烈的市街戰、這才退出多倫而守新陣地、</p>
<p>總只我沒有在多倫的市街上、聽到守軍的這樣電報、只好依樣戎蘆報告給讀者、但我相信最可靠的句話、我們戰略上並沒有失敗、同時我所希望等多倫的傷兵到張家口、再去訪問眞相、那時讀者們就澈底的明白了、（五月二日於張垣）</p>

<p>由察哈爾回來</p>
<p>（二）本報特派員國安</p>
<p>小車很吃力的在那上山的窄路上爬着、我們緊緊的跟在後面、這十幾里路的大壩、整整的爬了一個半鐘頭、在那最高的巅頂上、有一座古色斑爛的關帝廟、丨我們很恭敬的給關爺行了禮、和尙穿着破爛的衣服、來招待我們、在這裏吃到比較旁處乾凈的水所煑的茶、我們瞻仰關爺的塑像、他胸前飄着很長的美髯、胯下騎着棗紅色的神駒、那把大刀緊緊的握在右手、說不出的一股神氣兒、坐鎭在這萬山險竣的神衛臺口的頂巔上、如果有靈、必將領導我們大刀隊抗敵的、</p>
<p>我們在下山容易的口號下、總算抬着沉重的脚步、把這道大壩邁過、我有時立在那石塊上放恨四矚、羣山層列、購壑萬道、自己心裏在想、難道這樣的天險、還不能守嗎、但據趕小車的說、熱河的山勢、比這還要險惡萬分呢、</p>
<p>小車的輪盤、在這波浪式的羣山上緩緩的走着、過了大壩山形、已經緩慢了許多、經過了一個零落的小村莊、車夫告訴我們、門口　着白旗的、那就是蒙古人、但是這些蒙古人、已經被漢人通化了、所以性情很和善的、假設多倫北邊的蒙古人、就凶的多、他這樣對我說着、同時我又問了許多不性的事情、</p>
<p>在那數不淸的山頭上、常常看到用石塊堆的圓形的臺子、上面挿着一根旗桿、據說蒙古人管地呌「鬧包」、他們每個小集團區域裏、逢到某日或有什麽紀念的日子、無論男女老少都要羣集在「鬧包」前、舉行典禮、他們很敬謹的拜這一堆石塊、裏面眞正的原理、當地老白姓也說不淸、總只在一路的山地上、很容易看到這很神秘的「鬧包」、</p>
<p>在下午兩點包鐘時、過了黑山頂、那裏又是許多灰色的兵、混合着老百姓在挖戰壕、寛寛的外壕、圓而深的狼阱、方方的野砲陣地、很堅固的而又複雜不斷的、搆成了一個攻勢防禦的陣地網、這段地帶、又被小車通過、不久和那些運貨的牛車雜在一起、我很驚奇的那五六十輛的牛車、只有五六個人趕着、車上裝的都是方方的大箱、上面印着洋文、車頭上還押着黑白紅的旗子、不用說這又是洋大人的保險了、</p>
<p>在這裏我覺得老百姓都很儉樸、但他們嘴裏很多的吸着香烟、女人小脚的很少、頭上都包着靑色的布圍、多數上身穿着綠色的襖、褲子是大紅、呆板的臉、樣子有些像安南的女人、他們說的話、已經和山西人差不多、喜歡吃醋、（可不是爭風吃醋、）</p>
<p>我們小車在黄沙落日裏、一路總算很平安的到了張北縣（距張垣九十里）、四方空闊的大土城、在那平原的殘照中、彷彿是古城三通鼓的情景、我們由南門進城、晋軍有囗旅人駐在城裏、門崗都是軍隊把守、照例的盤查一過、於是小車慢慢的在城内的所謂大街爬着、這時在城外陣地工作的兵民們、都收工了、雖然空曠的城、在這裏看不到都市的高樓和汽車、但是一種不可形容的樸厚的精神、都市可沒有的、兵和百姓都眞正的團結着、日出而作、日落時休息、他們都在作杭日的準備、而不像那些大人先生的空喊口號、</p>
<p>我們在城裏盤旋着、找不到差强人意的旅店、何况又都住着兵、最後旁人告訴我們、到公安局報告、呌他們想法子吧、在這當兒恰巧遇到東北義軍李海靑部的柳支隊的參謀長邊鐡藩先生、把我們領到一個淸眞敎的大車店、黑洞洞的屋子、高高的大坑、昏暗不明的油證、我們也覺得在這荒漠沙城的旅途上、雖然這樣的不舒適、可是有什麽辦法呢、</p>
<p>很快的黑暗吞了大地、我們疲倦的身子、就躺在土坑上、蓋着不可多得的破爛被條、安息了、（五月一日於張垣）</p>

<p>新聲社云、實業部向德商喜望公司借欵、創辦鋼鐡廠事、現悉業經先後簽定兩草約、廠址確定於浦口左近之謝家店、已開始測量地基、并計算包工手續等、預定於下月中旬正式簽字、然後選派大批工程師約三四十人、赴德實習、俾於三年後、全廠完工後任用、茲分誌消息於次、</p>
<p>完全自主</p>
<p>實部創辦鋼鐡廠一舉、喧傳已久、外傳與德商喜望公司合資創設、據負責人聲稱、絶對不確、蓋鋼鐡廠之創設、實與國防上有重大之關係、即僅就廠址一層面論、亦非合於軍事上之需要不可、故此種於國防有關之事業、斷無與外人合資而爲其所操縱之理、且政府方面、鑒於已往中外合資事業之爲人操縱、故决計不使再蹈覆轍、因之此次鋼鐡廠之創辦、自始至終、即完全抱定自主之精神、與德商喜望公司磋商、而所簽合同、亦完全爲借欵而非合資性質、該公司僅帮同設計、及介紹工程人員等、無絲毫管理或確定任何事項之權、</p>
<p>借欵數目</p>
<p>至借欵數目、爲六千萬、以前報載二千萬或六百萬等、全非事實、全數六千萬借欵中、除一千萬移作建築費外、餘爲在德購置機械等用、利息甚輕微、約年息四厘、完全爲信用担保、無抵押、本利一律分期償還、</p>
<p>已簽兩約</p>
<p>該合同本於去年十二月一日、即擬實行簽字、嗣因煤礦關係、遂　致延期、最近除於去年簽定　草約外、安徽雷家溝之煤礦、係用以供給該廠之需要者、亦巳相繼簽定、最近經試練其火力、尙屬相宜、候其他計劃略定、即可於六月十五左右、簽定正式合同、</p>
<p>測量地基</p>
<p>廠址經確定於浦口左近之謝家店後、現巳關始測量地基、同時計算各項包工手續等、一俟测妥、即可開始招標、故此時不待正式簽字、亦可謂爲開工矣、預計全工須三年告竣、在建築期之工程、完全由喜望公司派德籍工程師會同實部辦理全市童軍總動員</p>

<p>資格問題和中學生出路問題</p>
<p>丨本埠傳若靑君來信丨</p>
<p>我是個年已二十而希望上進的靑年，可是我的家庭是終年困厄在窮的　園中，不瞞你先生說，近來連日常開支也在窘迫之中，原來我底父親是個窮困的　家，素來所賺不敷家用的，更以一二八滬戰失業到現在，進益絲毫沒有，家庭終日是籠罩在愁雲中，我每從學校裏回來，終是聽到那怨苦的嘆窮聲，心中十二分的難受，恨不得立刻能盡我底力，來貼補家用，以减少父母的痛苦，同時在我腦海裏，终是幻想着未來黄金般的前途。能　續求學高等敎育的夢的實現，然而這樣矛盾的事實，誠使我心中煩悶而悲痛苦分啊。</p>
<p>說起我底求　來，實痛心得很，我的父親是旣窮困而更採取不興問聞的，自小學以至現在高中，完全是每學期由自己向親友暫借而來的，受盡了社會上勢利的面孔，而節儉忍苦，奮鬥掙扎到如今，而平時更生活在不安定的生活環境裏，（我的哥哥曾同樣的借貸學資而完成了師範畢業，我的姊妹就中途失學在家裏）　　同時在我不幸和困苦的歷程中，在去年滬戰以後更不幸身患重病，致休學了半學期，（我讀的是本埠惟一的一個省立中學，）因半年之休學，致於不能隨班上升了，本來今年暑假就可以高中畢業了，先生你想在我這樣困難的環境中，更蒙上多一年的時間與經濟的損失，眞使我懊喪欲絶，其後由戚友之設法爲我在本埠租界上某私立中學謀一免費額，然仍爲相差一年，須待明夏方能畢業，但是我在這一年中仍無法以生産而貼補我的家庭，這怎樣是好呢　　再對於畢業文憑的問題，我如今想來脫離了省立中學而進了現在的私立中學，雖則目前得到免費，然而比較之下，名譽與學費均沒有省立中學的好與低，假使一旦不能全免，豈百戛</p>
<p>葬送了我中學的前途，又卽使高中畢業這文憑於我前途出路，不知也會發生問題嗎。</p>
<p>於此希望窮困悔恨交織在心頭，實無以解脫我深重的煩悶，我的出路在那裏呢，請煩先生給我一個明白的見解。</p>
<p>答：來書敬悉，你的家境旣然困難，能得一免費中學校讀書，將就畢業，再謀生路，便好，畢業文憑就我們主觀見解總是一個大錢不値，然而在這個重資格的社會中有文憑與沒文憑，有時候是差得很遠，這是不可否認的事實，若是眞有天才或堅忍不拔的奮鬥能力與創造精神的，那就沒有任何這種紙面上憑藉，他也會蓽路　褸，開物成務，然而這非所論于尋常，官私立中學的好壞，不能專從形式來判斷，要在從牠的内容上來批評，有些私立中學（自然是少有）只要有幾個好敎員，倒比省立國立的學校好，至於大多數靑年失學，這是現有制度的一般現象，單就一身一家來着想，絶不會能解决問題的，因此大家若果不努力從事於整個的社會問題之解决，像你這個人的「深重的煩悶」，也就無法消釋，「出路」更是沒有。</p>

<p>主席報告</p>
<p>主席張壽鏞報告、略謂今天爲煤命政府成立紀念日、革命政府之能成立、革命到今日能有相當之成功、不能不歸功於五四運動向者北京政府沉浸於媚日空氣之下、訂立密约、斷送國權、靑年目擊心傷、忍無可忍、始振臂一呼、造成壯烈之五四運動、故五四不僅爲一種學生運動、大部分含有抗日之意義、現在東三省已經變了顔色、處此國　嚴重之今日、對於暴日之侵略無已、更予我人以抗日救國之决心、但抗日救國並非貼標語喊口號所能成功、必須有要救國之方略、五四運動、亦卽新文化運動、從今日起大家應負起復興中國文化之責任、來作與術救國之運動、但從事復興文化、應行注意者、（一）内戰爲文化復興之障碍物、必須加以制止、（二）總理說中國人一盤散沙、從今日起我人應聯合國内學術團體·成一水門汀之基礎、再聯合國際成爲新文化之大厦、（三）打倒帝國主義應從學術上根本做起、（四）對國家對社會要負起貢獻的責任、希望同人共勉云云、</p>
<p>蔡氏演詞</p>
<p>康選宜代讀蔡元培氏演詞如下、前次貴會代表枉顧欲邀鄙人講演、當時以年老力衰、未曾肯定許諾、昨晨報載程序、始知貴會已將鄙人列入講演、爲維持貴會信約起見、曾準時力疾驅車赴市商會參加、及見會塲臨時改變、立卽遄赴靑年會又因捕房干涉未能開會、乃廢然而返、今日貴會補行儀式、本當親來參加、無如今晨感冒不克到會、茲請康選宜君隨帶手稿代表致詞、並朗誦致北大學生會與大學聯宣言、及所作「五四週年之回顧與希望」一文、覺當時所陳各節至今仍可作諸君之參考、幸勿以明日黄花袒之可也、五月的紀念日最多、除五一爲國際間公共問題外、餘如五山·五九·五卅等、均爲吾悲慘的紀念、稍稍差强人意的還是五四、五四運動所最切迫要求的、一不答字於巴黎和約、二罷免親日派曹陸章、這兩種要求、經當年全國學生艱苦的奮鬥、與上海北平等都市商工界罷工罷市的援助、而始爲當時的政府所容納、倘使此等要求僅僅爲一地方的學生所主張、或大多數學生有此要求而商工界不贊同、或不認爲重要、而不加援助、則仍不能達到目的、所以參加五四運動的學生感於商工界援助之有力、而悟普及常識的需要、一方面大學生每於課餘辦校役敎育及平民學校、一方面促進語體文之發展、出版之書籍及雜誌較前踴躍、且彼等自五月四日至七月二十三日八十日之奮鬥、感於環境之善變、與應付之困難、悟學力不足者不能應變、而勉學之精神爲之增進、所以五四運動中最得力的學生、於運動告一段落以後無不力學、多有畢業大學以後、赴外國留學、更求深造、至今成爲著名學者的、現在國難之酷烈、視十五年前酷烈到萬倍、我們感覺到十五年普及常識提倡力學的成效、尙屬微乎其微、祗要從軍隊戰鬥力與提倡國貨等事觀察就明白、孟子說七年之病求三年之艾、我們若再不能切切實實的從根本上求救濟、我們的紀念五日運動、也不是很有意義的、</p>

<h3 id="c2">調節再生的方式 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭仲陶</p>
<p>普通三燈以下的收音機，加上一個再生圈，可以增加收音效率不少。現在我就來談談怎樣調節再生。調節再生的方法，有下列四種；</p>
<p>一·活動再生圈法，</p>
<p>二·活動電容器調節法，</p>
<p>三·電阻調節，</p>
<p>四·燈絲調節，</p>
<p>試依次叙述之。</p>
<p>活動再生圈法這方法是用一個活動的再生圈，藉再生圈與次級圈地信的遠近或方向，來配合感應力的大小，以調節再生。平常市上出售的摇鼓式三回路綫圈，和蛛網式的綫圈架，就屬於這一類。摇鼓式的綫圈，在再生圈與次級上</p>
<p>圈地位平行時，感應最大，即再生力最强；成直角時，感應最小，再生最弱。（若情形相反，則因再生圈反接之故，應改接）至於蛛網式的一種，是以距離遠近來定再生力的大小。綫路圖見圖一。</p>
<p>活動電容器調節法前法調節，不甚便利，若把再生圈和次級圈地位，使之固定，另外加裝一活動電容器，容量要·○○○三五或·○○○五小法拉特（ＭＩＣＲＯＦＡＲＡＤ）。（須看線圈多少而定，線圈多則容量不妨小些，綫圈少容量要大些。）接線的方法，是將再生圈接聽筒柱的一端，同時接電容器的定片；電容器的活動片，接Ｂ電負極而通入地綫。圖二及圖三，就是他的線路圖。下圖所不同者，祗有在接聽筒的一端，多加一個高週率扼制圈，這是爲要减少雜音而設的。</p>
<p>電阻調節法再生力之大小與屏極電流成正比，所以聽筒筒和Ｂ電正極之間，加上一個五十萬歐姆的活動電阻，就可用以調節再生。電阻和電壓成反比，電壓和電流成正比，因此我們可以藉電阻的大小，以增减屏極電壓，又因屏壓與屏電流之關係而調節再生力。線圈圖見圖四。圖中一小法拉特之固定電容器，是用以防止因活動電阻器的活動柄，和電阻部分接觸不固而發生雜聲的。</p>
<p>燈絲調節法這方法和上法同理，不過是用燈絲的明暗，使電流有强弱，以調節再生力。調節再生用的燈絲調節器，他的電阻要比平常用的大，最好要用炭質的一種，就是英文所謂ＣＡＲＢＯＮＰＩＴＥＲＨＥＯＳＴＡＴＥ者。見圖五。</p>
<p>上述各方法，據作者的經騐，以第二第三兩種調節容易，效率最大，此外尙有幾種方法，這裏從略。</p>
<h3 id="c3">電源變壓器製作法（續） <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>於初級輸入、其輸出工率與輸入工率之比，謂之效率，常以百分數表之，如下：丨</p>
<p>在表中各變壓器之效率，均爲實騐所測定，甚爲合用。</p>
<p>在表中找出輸入５０瓦特之變壓器，乘以該變壓器之效率，則其輸出數當爲：丨</p>
<p>50×·75＝37.5瓦特·</p>
<p>如例之變壓器，輸出爲３４瓦特，小於上數，故可用５０瓦特者，方甚安全。</p>
<p>初級輸入爲５０瓦特，接於２００弗打之電線上，故可知通過該線圈之電流，而决定用幾號線。計算電電的公式如下：丨</p>
<p>可在第二表中扛出所用線的號數。初級用２４號線（Ｂ.　s.）</p>
<p>次級（１）用１４號線（二根普繞之）</p>
<p>（２）１５或１４號線</p>
<p>（３）３４號線</p>
<p>第二表</p>
<p>變壓器之圈數，可以每弗打圈數乘弗打數即得。</p>
<p>初級圈4.8×２２０＝１０５６圈（與表中同）</p>
<p>被級圈（１）４.８×２.５＝１２圈</p>
<p>（２）４.8×5＝24圈</p>
<p>（3）4.8×600＝2880圈（在1440圈　抽出丨頭卽中心線）</p>
<p>鐡心最好是用山字形的矽鋼片疊成，但是這種鐡片的價値很貴，亦可用汽油箱的鐡皮，剪成山字形代之，如例變壓器之鐡心，其大小如圖二，其他變壓器之鐡心，可仿此。</p>
<p>鐡心剪成後，以洋漆或磁漆塗一薄層於其上，以免渦流損失。再用厚紙做成如第三圖所示的架子。做好後即可繞線。先繞实級圈，後繞高壓次級圈，繞低壓次級於最外。線須繞得極整齊，每層間隔以蠟紙，初級與次級間尤須隔幾層，以防漏電。所用之線以漆包爲宜，因其能耐較高之電壓，所佔地位較小故也。線完全繞好後，將其全部浸入洋燭油中煎過，以防受潮。然後再將鐡心相對的挿入，即成一完美之變壓器矣！（完）</p>

<p>— ＶＴ</p>
<p>天線的構造對於免除收音時的電台干涉和各種擾亂有重大的關係，這是誰也不能否認的事實。干擾大體可分三種，一是大氣的干擾，這是人們所不能避除的。二是由電機工作而生的干擾，三則爲多數電台所發的電波互相干涉。這個我們却可以用天線的特别構造來補救和避免。</p>
<p>補救的方法，就是用一根短的垂直天綫，只要十呎長，裝置於屋頂最高處。其所用引入綫則爲遮蔽導綫。（ＳＣＲＣＥＮＥＤＬＥＡＮＩＮＷＩＲＥ）就是把引入導綫施以遮蔽而接地）。但同時對於收音機内部的接線亦需時别留意，接地務須特别完美。收音機本身也要施以遮蔽。必要時更可使用一隻濾波器。</p>
<p>天線短至十呎，在現在收音機構造日臻完美之時，本來已不成問題。但爲增加收音成績起見，天線的電容量仍不宜過小。增加其電容量的方法，向來只是把天線根數增多，但天線根數增多，干擾仍將增大。所以我們應該用一種螺旋式天線，以增加長度。這樣，電容量可以增大，而電台的干擾却可以儘量的避免了。</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>東京城内的反英熱度，比着打齋飯雜劇中所唱的：「熱得裏個來，熱得矮子雙脚跳」還熱！但看，全城木牌竹籬電桿所貼的黑白紅字印成的反英標語，一種頓足怨恨的情形，幾乎要把他們的木屐都踏成了幾　！尤其是「英國不顧英日友誼，以怨報德。」「集合中國四萬萬印度三萬萬人驅逐英人勢力至蘇彝士河之西。」上一條，好似少婦怨情人，下一條，好似潑辣貨駡街；但，不知英人得了這個消息，嚇得一跳呢，還是付之一笑？</p>
<p>笑呢？跳呢？暫不去理會；但，就冷靜眼光看了這兩條標語，便不免發生以下的兩種疑問：</p>
<p>貴國民衆，也知道友誼麽？也知道怨與德的界說麽？試試問我們中華和貴國，難道够不上一個友字麽？貴國文化，完全由中華得來，精神上，物質上，都得着中華的助力不少，貴國歛水思源，難道忘卻了中華的大德麽？朱明時代，貴國屢擾我們海疆，且置不論；最近數十年來，我們沒有侵略貴國，而貴國屢起兵戎，割琉球，滅高麗，索臺灣，吞遼吉黑熱，難道不是以怨報德麽？</p>
<p>貴國要驅逐英人至蘇彝十河之西，只怕「一口喝盡西江水」，沒有這麽一回事吧。卽使，有了這事實，我們被貴國横加蹂躪的四萬萬民衆，居然也在集合之列，未免有些受寵若驚吧。旣在和中國人合作，爲什麽又把中國人摧殘呢？若說同在亞洲，同屬黄種，本來有合作的可能；爲什麽自從九一八以來，只見貴國人向歡洲人暗送秋波，而專把狠毒無比的大砲飛機向那同洲同種的中國人肆虐呢？貼標語，是貴國的自由；但，把中國四萬萬人也寫在上面，不是太開玩笑了麽？</p>

<p>一個人到了「計窮援絶，無可奈何」的時候，就是呌做「末路。」所以「末路」就是人生事業最後的一站，從字面和意義看來，當然含着充分的悲袁與凄凉。</p>

<p>眞討厭，隔壁王好婆又要來了！吃</p>
<p>點倒不在乎，嘮嘮叨叨地開張了話匣，聽了好不頭痛！」這都是我的祖母，在午飯和點心時候，常說的話。原來舍間的高隣王好婆，是紅樓夢裏的劉老老轉世，生成一副會講話的　嘴。還有一個特性，便是見了人家烟突裏出烟，或是釜鍋烹飪的聲音，伊必光臨到我家來。當然，見了我們老年的祖母，要扳談起來，東家長，西家短，說個不休。我們這時候要吃午飯，或點心已端了上來，當然，不能讓王好婆獨坐向隅。她老人家倒也當仁不讓，一屁股坐了下來，吃了一個鬯飽。一壁狼吞虎咽地吃，一壁大講其山海經，先吟了一聲「阿彌陀佛」，然後　着嘴道：「阿大的娘，昨夜被人家捉姦了：阿二的媳婦，偷了漢子逃走了。」一件件社會裏的艶聞，報告給我祖母聽，好像報館裏的外勤記者。吃完了飯，王好婆揩了揩嘴吧，談鋒從此便收歛了。要等到明天或後天，我們的烟突出烟，釜鑊的聲，響了起來，伊會再光降到我們寒舍來，開始其　嘴的工作。</p>
<p>這幾天壁蝨上市·我因此聯想到小時候的王好婆。眞是奇怪，我們在床角帳頂，做了半天的剿匪工作，滿望一網打盡，赤匪滅跡，安安穩穩地過太平日子，做太平百姓。豈知它們出沒無常，化整爲零，集零爲整，委實不易盪平丨我們因爲夜不安眠，晝間便不能做事；所以「攘外」必先「安内」，纔是天經地義的軍事策略。譬如再過幾天，毒蚊便要吮我們的膏血，只要我們緊閉着帳子，有了這個長城般的國防，便不爲遭毒蚊子侵略，可以高枕無憂。唯有床縫裏的壁蝨，纔是最難解决的内患丨所以「攘外」必先「安内」，捉壁蝨的工作，重於撲滅毒蚊的工作；因此，在下撇開毒蚊，只談壁蝨。</p>
<p>據說：壁蝨的聽覺嗅覺，都很靈敏，我們不能聽見自己體内血液流行的聲音，在壁蝨聽來，好像長江大河澎湃奔騰的潮聲一般。我們是不爲嗅着自己的腋臭氣，口臭氣，牛頭臭氣等等，自己正得意遍體芬芳馥郁，吹氣如蘭：可是吹入壁蝨的鼻子裏，自然心裏明白，當然逐臭之夫，如　附膻了。壁蝨這種本領，和跳蚤一班斑無二，把跳蚤的跳躍本領來比人，不是能夠跳過沙遜屋頂嗎？這都是蟲類得天獨厚，毋須羨幕欽佩。唯有我們的高隣五好婆，也是如此！</p>

<p>當此地球上各處都鬧着經濟恐慌的時候，就是維持生命的必需品，「飯」，能夠每餐少吃一碗也是好的。那吃了不能飽的嗜好品，自然也當節約些，或者就用那品質差點的，價錢便宜點的。</p>
<p>但是，那從前消路很好的，價錢比較昂貴點的商品，不是因大家都節約些，「貨如山積」地在堆棧裏　爛了嗎？不顧血本的大减價，那不是玩兒的。资本家於深思竭想之後，說句漂亮的話：我們把工廠停了工，存貨拍賣了，也不是難事，祗是那工人失業，倒是社會上一個重大問題哩？</p>
<p>於是利用趨向沒落的社會會羣衆僥倖心理，想出　多「有奬贈劵」「現金奬」等玩意兒。</p>
<p>於是向來　吸香烟的學生小姐，也買兩包國貨白金龍香烟，參加詩謎競猜。希望着得個頭奬，「現金五百元」。</p>
<p>向來不曾用過什麽香皂洗臉的工人，也儉省下吃飯的錢，買幾塊棕欖香皂，把飛機，塔，蝴蝶，公雞，兎子等碎片從報紙上剪下來，另用白紙併黏成一張圖。希望着得一座收音機。或是不參加免費游普陀蘇州三天，也可折領現金幾十元。</p>
<p>聽說政府發行的航空奬券，已經發售了。幾個人併夥也得買一張，做一次黄金之夢。有了麥克麥克，那意大利瑞士法國，就祇讓「大人物」能去遨游的嗎？　　大家都四脚朝天，仰臥床上希望着吧！</p>
<p>希望和僥倖，是我們中國的精神文明。希望日本兵會自動退出長城，退出熱河東三省。皇天有眼，也應該把東瀛三島沉淪啦！日本原來是多地震的島國呀！</p>

<p>— 張若春</p>
<p>水晶宫</p>
<p>每天黄昏，掛了手杖，在霞飛路人行道散步，兩旁的商店　飾，看得慣了。這一夜，在金神父路附近，意外地發現了一個新奇的窗戶。高大透明的玻璃窗裏，陳列着許多砲彈式的汽水瓶，紅白兩色相間，瓶上鎳製的蓋　附屬品，反射出耀目的電光，攝住了散步者的視綫。</p>
<p>一隻曲尺形的白漆櫃台，排滿了大小玻璃瓶，從那些盛着鑛泉的亮晶晶的器皿隙處，露出一個白衣少女的倩影。四面是白漆，銀色，琉璃，完全是夏天海濱露天飲冰處的情調。</p>
<p>我和一個新從維也納回來的朋友，和穿一身銀灰色法蘭絨新西裝的朋友，揀了靠近馬路那邊的座位，在白漆監線條的籐椅上坐了下來。　　我們用着驚奇的目光，四週巡視了一遍，知道在這裏旣沒有咖啡，也沒有啤酒。招牌告訴我們，這是一個專賣「沙達礦泉」的所在，我們便吩咐那個獨一無二的女侍者，給我們預備三杯礦泉。</p>
<p>黄髮碧眼的侍女，送上了三盞不同顔色的菓汁礦泉。紅得像女人櫻唇的，是梅汁；橙黄像金柑的，是檸檬，我揀了一杯肥皂沫般的流液，從舌尖辨出了巧克力的旨味。</p>
<p>不知是心理作用，還是科學的效能，我們發覺礦泉的味道，的確和普通的蘇打水或沙濾水有些不同。礦泉的質地似乎厚而且冽。我飲過無錫的惠泉，也嘗過杭州虎跑寺的泉茶，惠泉和泉茶是用泉煮的，所以感覺淸香微含苦澀。這礦泉是冲混着菓汁，祇覺甜蜜而凉沁心臓。</p>
<p>在我們頭上，有四盞舞台式的電燈，射出强烈的白熱光，我們像是在水晶燈下正在表演的電影演員，隔着玻璃窗眺望街頭的行人，只見模糊的憧憬影子，我們靜穆地抽着捲烟，四週是明亮閃耀的玻璃窗鏡，又像是置身童話和美麗傳說中的水晶宫裏一樣。</p>
<p>紙烟漸漸地燃燒下去，杯盞裏的礦泉也慢慢兒像潮退般低落下去。我們的談鋒開始了。</p>
<p>甲：「某翁的雅興眞好，他最近發表了和一個自稱小鬼的女學生通信，你們看過沒有？」</p>
<p>乙：「沒有，那不過是肉麻當有趣的玩意兒罷了，有什麽好看。」</p>
<p>丙：「那不是尋常的情書吓，那女學生是替某翁生孩子的女人吓，不可不看。」</p>
<p>乙：「最多是尋窮開心的東西而已。」</p>
<p>甲：「你不要太看輕人家，某翁自有他了不得的偉大。他的偉大，便是被他所討厭的人們所討厭的人，他會覺得他就是好人物。」</p>
<p>丙：「某翁的唯一好處據我看來，便是對於中國人的一切言動，處處都從壞處看。中國人說好的，他却終以爲是壞的。中國人所討厭的，他偏說是好的。</p>
<p>甲：「這不是他的不近人情，他喜歡從壞處着想，正是證明他愛中國人。所謂惟其愛之愈甚，恨之亦愈甚。」</p>
<p>乙：「某翁說起話來，人家覺得可笑，他自己却不笑，爲什麽呢？」</p>
<p>丙：「因爲中國人好笑的緣故」。</p>
<p>甲：伯納蕭到上海的時候，蕭笑了一笑，於是某翁不是也跟着笑嗎？你們不信，有照片爲證。」</p>
<p>乙：「若使某翁眞正是喜歡蕭的爲了愛之愈甚恨之亦愈甚的理由，他便應該打蕭一下耳光。」</p>
<p>一小時的時間，便這樣地過去。</p>

<p>繭茶汛中洋用仍微</p>
<p>丨泰半爲市面蕭索關係丨</p>
<p>今年金融界對於蘭茶兩種用途、完全無重大見聞、經記者調查所得、並非無人出發往做、而用途本屬仍有、祗以現在銀行對於各屬都會、大概皆有分支行或代理機關、故即有需要、類率就近支用、而在滬行轉賬者、故裝現一節、似可無形取消、藉免路途跋涉、及減免運費、與沿途危險之麻類與安寗、因此現欵卽有裝、大都銀行方面自己分期與各分支行而已、宜其每年最繁盛之大好茶繭汛、而表面竟寂然無聞焉、</p>

<p>公債仍在醖釀期中</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所市面比較緊張、但仍不脫混沌盤旋之狀、市上人心仍屬見仁見智、意向不同、大戶多空不動、散戶交易比較靈敏、仍以頭盤進出較旺、因十六及三十五號稍有需要、賣出方面、均爲零碎　交易、故市價略見提高二三角、其中一九關尙小去一角、次盤散戶頗有多頭結出、除一九善後尙稍好五分或一角外、餘則均回落一角至二角五分、盤旋之勢益顯、午後開盤二十及二十一號稍有買進、統稅提高三角、餘亦略好一二角、數種則毫無上落、收盤裁兵　面稍有補空、提高二三角、餘亦帶好五分至一二角、惟本月份鹽稅則又小去五分、迷離錯綜、莫此爲甚、盤旋醖釀、或尙有數日之延常、變動之來、似尙有待、綜計市價結果、漲起五分一角、多至三四角、惟遠期　兵獨漲五角爲最多、成交總數、計共五百七十九萬三千元、内現貨三千元、期貨鹽稅最多、佔一百六十一萬、统統稅及載兵均佔一百萬有零、餘則數萬至三四十萬而已、</p>

<p>紗花</p>
<p>紗花市場出現新多頭</p>
<p>紗市平靜、形勢較爲穩定、因有一部份購進做多、且原棉上漲甚勁、致紗市更見堅昂、但實需依然平淡、新做多頭者未見十分踴躍、目前市狀、有立定的可能性、</p>
<p>本月紗好元半</p>
<p>人標前市開盤、市况平平、各月漲二三角、旋以棉市堅昂、各月又漲、結果漲四·五·七·角、午後開盤平平、二三盤上漲、各月又漲一·二·三·四·五·角、全日成交統計二萬三千一百包、查賣出永昌一千一百五十包、通記一千包、長豐一千○五十包、元德六百包、買進永大一千一百包、華昌八百包、明德七百包、收盤價如下、</p>

<p>棉市甚硬、漲風頗銳、因新買者蜂擁而來、以近日外棉平定、而匯兌不長、採算銀盤較昂、且各路産區之價稍漲、於是賣戶缺乏、一般投機者傾向購進、市盤趨漲、但廠方以紗市不良、仍無重大量的進意、</p>
<p>鄭標輕快前進</p>
<p>鄭標前午開盤、市况卽漲、形勢鋒利、多說現棉有需要、故買戶較多、各月漲一角半至四·五·角、午後有一大戶購進、市氣仍昂、各月又漲一·二·角、全日成交統計十萬○七千五百擔、查賣出源大五千一百擔、同孚二千七百擔、通記三千一百擔、瑞大二千九百擔、長豐二千一百擔、椿記一千七百擔、買進賡豐四千擔、森康九千九百擔、益豐五千擔、仁豐二千擔、恒德二千五百擔、收盤價如下、</p>

<p>蘇浙蠶汛續誌</p>
<p>武進</p>
<p>蘇屬武進亦爲育蠶最盛區域、全邑繭行達二百餘家、每屆繭産不减無錫、近年來因受天時之損害、蠶事連遭失敗、今歲米價又賤、春行冬令、小熟失望、農村經濟破産、購種無資、更兼暮春寒雨兼旬、桑株發芽較遲、故四鄕春蠶異常沈寂、後幸天氣轉晴、植有桑樹之農民、始各借貸　本、購種孵育、飼額以東鄕横林戚墅堰一帶爲暢、且飼育洋種者多、西鄕間有孵育土種者、温度適宜、收蟻頗齊、西鄕早帮已開葉多日、東鄕晚帮尙祇試葉、</p>
<p>海寗</p>
<p>浙屬海寗各市鄕、今歲因經濟及天時等關係、早帮孵育之土種傾棄十之七八、嗣後天氣轉佳、農民咸借貸蠶本、增購改良種、從事孵育收蟻後、氣候適宜、蠶蟻發育順利、早帮改良種蠶經過良好、已三眠旺葉、晚帮亦將起眠、近兩日温度較低、兼有陰雨、而蠶戶得指導員之協助、調護尙鮮顯著之變動、聞金石墩等處間有遲不起眠者、　　遂安珍眉貨到未開盤</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、形勢依然不利、遂安來路莊之珍眉四十六箱、昨日大帮業已到齊、比經正式佈樣、全市談判結果、錦隆協和天裕等行、雖均有進意、然因船期尙遠、並不急需、且鑒於華茶商堅持方、夙稱薄弱、是以均持觀望態度、故日來温州·遂安·土莊等路新茶先後上市、新盤均未開出、此種沉悶狀况、爲近年以來所未有云　　婺源毛峯已開採</p>
<p>婺邑四鄕新茶、近兩日因天放晴轉暖、洲園早茶、芽抽甚速、北鄕延川金竹一帶各村茶戶、鑒本年洋莊不俏、茶價低賤、均多改製毛峯待售、昨日起已有少數提早開園摘嫩、冀出品優良、易沽善價、金竹利生祥茶莊、前日已在近村張貼通告、勸山戶一律早採、並有出價收靑、每葉片一斤、計値洋二角四分至三角、如連朝天晴不雨、頭芽毛峯、將有大宗出新、</p>

<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來船二十四五艘、白粳走化晨刻淸淡、午市店胃續化、故市定立、薄稻定勢、早稻稍軟、秈米仍屬定立、俼元平平、白元來源續有、零化尙可、市形稍疲云、</p>
<p>粉市渙散近期愈覺不穩</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上市開盤後、各月份依然呈近虚遠平之象、以洋麥報價雖仍好二三四角左右、惟北路客帮、因戰事愈形緊迫、購買力固已薄弱、問訊者更寂、因此本月份開價卽見不穩、較前日跌去五釐、六月份人心亦不見穩、交易旣少、市氣尤形渙散、七月份以下、尙見平定、迨至下午開盤、本月份形勢愈見不穩、開價卽四角進關、最低至二元三角九分半、爲改洋之最小紀錄、旋因廠家略抵、市稍回高、六月份亦因吸戶更少、又　　市塲拾零</p>
<p>洋米平穩、南京回籠大小絞米各二千包、昨由甬帮辦去、大絞七元零五分及七元、小絞七元一角半、木街向洋行辦小絞一千二百包、價七元五角五分及二分、</p>

<h3 id="c16">聲東擊西 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— 旭</p>
<p>中國戰略上的名詞，與安外攘内相對的，還有一個呌作聲東擊西。日本帝國主義的軍隊的侵佔，明明是在東北，而中國大軍的去向，却偏不朝着這一方面走。尤其神出鬼沒，使人難料的，是丄南的防禦計劃。自東北打來，我想無論如何大的大砲，現在一砲，現在一砲，總也還打不到西南，但西南的邊境、却已在築起防禦工事來了。</p>
<p>這一種聲東擊西的中國戰略，不但在實地作戰上用得着，就是在一般　宣言上也用得着。請看五一節市總工會告工友書裏，先說要一致團結起來，打倒國際資本主義的侵略，反抗本國資本家無理的壓迫；接着就說中國生産落後，要克苦耐勞，加緊工作，使出品成本減輕；末了尤注重於共體時艱，力謀勞資間之眞誠合作（見五月一日申報本市新聞欄）的一段文章，就可以明白。</p>
<p>外國人在政戰上商戰上或它地作戰上，用這一個戰術的，原也不少，不過他們用得比中國巧妙，使人一眼看去，不容易看出所以然來。譬如日本明明有野心想併合察綏，掩佔平津，積極地在暗中策動，而日使有吉向記者之言，却說日本目下所取的態度，是靜觀主義，大致是對中國旣不打仗，又不交涉的意思。奥國爲意大利修理幾萬槍械，表面上似乎只是商業上的買賣契約，但實際却早被英法看穿，而提出了抗議，說是爲保持歐州的和平，實行各國的軍縮，不得不取這强硬的態度。</p>
<p>用這聲東擊西的戰略，原是中外一例的，可是中國人的用處，似乎只用在對内，而外國人的用此，却專在對外，不過有這一點不同而已。</p>

<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>一個人在大街上踱着想着，我的脚步却於不知不覺的中間，開了倒車，幾個灣兒一繞，竟又將我自己的身體，搬到了大學近旁的一條路上來了。向前面看過去，又是一堆土山。山下是平平的泥路和淺淺的池塘。這附近一帶，我兒時原也來過的。二十幾年前頭，我有一位親戚曾在報國寺裏當過軍官，更有一位哥哥，曾在陸軍小學堂裏當過學生。旣然已經回到了寓居的附近，那就爬上山去看牠一看吧，好在一晚沒有睡覺，頭腦還有點兒糊塗，登高望望四境，也未始不是一帖淸凉的妙藥。</p>
<p>天氣也漸漸開朗起來了，東南半角，居然已經露出了幾點靑天和一絲白日。土山雖則不高，但眺望倒也不壞。湖上的羣山，環繞在西北的一帶，再北是空間，更北是湖州境内的髮樣的靑山了。東面迢迢，看得見的，是臨平山，臯亭山，黄鶴山之類的連峯疊障。再偏東北處，大約是唐棲上的超山山影，看去雖則不遠，但走走怕也有半日好走哩。在土山上環視了一周，由遠及近，用大量觀察法來一算，我纔明白了這附近的地理。原來我那新寓，是在軍裝局的北方，而三面的土山，係遥接着城牆，圍繞在軍裝局的匡外的。怪不得今天破曉的時候，還聽見了一陣喇叭的吹唱，怪不得走出新寓的時候，還看見了一名荷槍直立的守衛士兵。</p>
<p>「好得很！好得很！……」我心裏在想「前有圖書，後有武庫，文武之道，備於此矣！」我心裏雖在這樣的自作有趣，但一種沒落的感覺，一種不能再在大都會裏揷足的哀思，竟漸漸地漸漸地溶浸了我的全身。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c18">五月 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— 周木齋</p>
<p>五月到了，日本和中國總結賬的時候到了。</p>
<p>是朋也，在廢曆，相傳是個毒月，而初五這天，又是毒月的毒日，定爲端午節，貼紙符，挿艾劍，懸鍾馗像，飲雄黄酒，據說都是用來辟邪消災的。</p>
<p>是月也，在現曆，有「五三」「五四」「五五」（註）「五七」「五九」「五卅」等紀念日道些零碎的紀念日　成了一篇五月的糊塗賬。各個紀念日，照例都開紀念會，掛中山像，貼標語，喊口號，此外有時還休假一天。這些绒紀念日的債主，或完全，或部份，是無一不與日本有關係的，大概各紀念日的例行工作，是在打倒「東洋鬼子」或者「倭鬼」了。</p>
<p>用中國的老話來表明兩者的不同：端午節的對象可說是「天災」，目的可說是「保家」：各種紀念日的對象是「人禍」，目的是「救國」。</p>
<p>「天災」是長期的，「長期抵抗」須有持久的力，所以首先還要「準備抵抗」丨丨不，「準備抵抗」就是「長期抵抗」，剌激蓄藏的力而又蓄藏起來。這樣，毒月就變成令節了。發揮性的雄黄酒與凝鍊性的糯米粽，在這裏是異其功用，相輔而行的。他們雖不知道「保家不忘娱樂」，却也能說「和氣致祥」一類的話。從這意義看來，長期抵抗不是現代人的發明，而是中國的傳統藝術。</p>
<p>古質今文，現代人當然更要巧妙些。在紀念日休假，可說「讀書不忘救國」。這是第一部曲。紀念日的本義在向死骨裏注射些新生命，現在却想從死骨得到些剌激力了。救國先須救己，救已先須救心，於是遊目騁懷，「娱樂救國」。這是第二部曲。剌激過了頭，換來了麻醉。剌激的初現是緊張，是督促，緊張雖是瞬息的，被督促者却已夠受用了：物有本末，歸眞返樸，自然又得還元：「救國不忘讀書」。這是第三部曲。緊張過了頭，結局就是「鎭靜」。</p>
<p>舊曆五月在名義上是算廢除了；現曆五月的一篇糊塗賬呢？</p>

<h3 id="c19">小荷子 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— 王婉容</p>
<p>桃花雖已零落，好在紫荆花又在怒放，不久芬芳的　微又將代替艶　的紫荆。走出北城，一路上擠滿游春的男女。桃花㵎的瀑布不息地往前衝，幾個紅衣衣郎對着飛濺的水花在笑。動人的笑聲跟着流水遠去。蔚藍色有天空，鹽浮着白雲，布穀鳥的啼聲告訴我們春深了。</p>
<p>爬過刻着「桃共㵎」三制紅字的大石，再轉過一座很高的貞　節坊，在松柏和粟樹叢裏現出了一座　凉的墳墓。雖然今天是淸明了，但是墓前找不到紙灰和鮮花，更沒有人在那裏流涙或　息。只有一雙杜鵑在樹枝上哀吟。桃花㵎的流水的淸韻，傳到了道冷靜的境界。</p>
<p>走到墓前，墓後　首一塊石碑，碑上的字蹟已經模糊了，但是細細地辨認了一下，還可看出：「　荷子之墓」五個字。「　荷子　在　　麽？」我　着。同時一個　黄的小女孩的影子，在我面前幌動。</p>
<p>小荷子是個賣技的小孩，她跟着她的父母和同伴們摇着船兒在各處飄泊，每年總得來我的故鄕幾次。船兒恰巧停在書房窗外的一個碼頭上，我時常聽到她的同伴們這樣喊她，所以和戛</p>
<p>道「小荷子」是她的芳名。</p>
<p>只要那艘破舊的白木大船靠宾窗外的碼頭，我便開始忙碌了，别說上學堂，連吃飯也缺少了心緒，整天伏在窗上擲些水菓到他們船上，逗那隻紅衣裳的猴子玩。照例，上午十時光景她們用午餐，以後便收拾一切，小荷子的父親，那個中年人，和兩個年輕漢子，　了箱籠，和其他一切應用東西，小荷子母親的肩上蹲着那隻紅衣裳的猴子，小荷子換上了紅襖綠褲，在母親後面，大夥兒出發，到枕石軒茶肆前面那塊空塲上去演技。</p>
<p>小荷子的本領可不小，她會站在她母親足上熜騰的那個酒瓶上唱歌、還會把辫兒吊在半空中的一根竹槓上幹脫衣裳和穿衣裳的把戲。不過那孩子老是黄著臉，身體疲得好像一隻乾　雞似的。去年來我的故鄕是這般黄瘦，這般矮小，今年來還是這般黄瘦，這般矮小。看那樣子永遠是十一二歲光景。</p>
<p>二年前的一個新年，小荷子又跟她的父母同伴被那隻破舊的白木大船帶到了我的窗下。我又整天伏在窗子上逗那隻紅衣服的猴子玩。小荷子不但還是那般黄瘦，那般矮小，並且時常看見她捧着胸，蹙着眉咳嗽。但是她照樣每天十時光景上岸賣技，下午五時光景回到船上。</p>
<p>這一天，大約兩點鐘，我和哥哥們正在擲骰子玩，突然靜寂了好一會的碼頭上起了噪囃的人聲，一會兒又傳來了婦人的啼哭聲，我放下了骰子，走進書室，開了窗向碼頭上一望，碼頭上許多閒看的人都在紛紛地議論着。一會兒小弟弟從外面跳進來說：小荷子今天又站在她母親　上　　的酒　　上唱歌，誰知　一軟，從很高的地方跌下地　，吐了幾口血，　　　了。</p>
<p>傍晚，碼頭上又傳來了釘棺木和小荷子的母親的號哭聲。笑二天早上，不見動靜，推開　子向外」望，兩隻破舊的白木大船不知何時巳悄悄地離開碼頭了。</p>
<p>一年兩年，破舊的白木大船沒有再來過，矮小黄瘦，捧着胸，蹙着眉低咳着的小荷子的印象也就從我的腦中消逝了；誰知今天却會無意地在踏靑散步的途中發現這可憐的女孩見的墳墓呢？</p>
<p>雖是和自己沒有一點關係的陌生人，但一想到那樣小的年紀，便和生活掙扎着，而在沒有嘗到半點生的甜味以前，便睡進了黄土，自巳總有一種「天乎難問」的黯然之感。</p>
<p>我把在路上採來的紫荆花鄭重地挿在墳願：丨可憐的小荷子，好好的安眠着罷！</p>

<h3 id="c20">紅蘿蔔鬚 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— JULESRENARD作林取譯</p>
<p>點點麵面</p>
<p>雷辟克遇着高興的時候，是狠樂意親自使得他的孩子們開心的。他在花園裏散步的時候，對他們講着一些故事，有時使得大哥斐利克斯和紅蘿蔔鬚笑得在地上打滚。這天早上，他們正又在笑得要命。姐兒愛勒絲丁却跑來告訴他們飯已開上桌子，他們便突然寗靜了。每逢一家子團坐一塊時，各人的臉孔總是顰蹙着的。</p>
<p>大家像平常　樣迅速而又沉默地吃着飯，一會兒，除開雷辟克家的一個人外，其餘全都吃完了，這時雷辟克家的說道：</p>
<p>「請你給我一點點麵包來塗完我這點菓醬！」</p>
<p>她是對什麽人說的呢？</p>
<p>大部分時候，雷辟克家的總是自己一個人吃着東西，因而她祇和狗談着。她對牠數說小菜的價錢，她對牠仲述現在這時候用少許的錢養活六個人和一條狗的困難。</p>
<p>「不，」她對那用尾巴拍着草墊，對她親切地咕嚕着的皮拉麥（狗名）說，「你眞不知道我支持這份人家的苦楚呢。你也同那些男子一樣，以爲一個廚　娘有了一點點錢便什麽都可買到啦。牛油漲了價或是雞蛋貴得嚇人，你當然一樣毫不關心的。」</p>
<p>可是，這次，雷辟克家的的態度却異乎尋常。她那話是破例直接對雷辟克說的。她這次是對他，的的確確是對他要求一點點麵包來塗完她的菓醬。這事沒有懷疑　餘地。第一因爲她說話時瞧着雷辟克。其次，因爲麵包放在雷辟克面前。雷辟克起初吃了一驚，他躊躇了一下，隨後，他用指尖在他那吃過的髒盆子裏面挑起一點點麵包，帶着一種狠正經又狠暗鬱的臉色擲給雷辟克家的。臉色擲給雷辟克家的。</p>
<p>這是笑劇呢，還是悲劇？誰知道呢？</p>
<p>姐兒愛勒絲丁覺得母親受辱了，心裏感着模糊的恐懼。</p>
<p>「爸爸今天狠高興開頑笑呢，」大哥斐利克斯旁若無人的騎在椅背上這樣想。</p>
<p>至於紅蘿蔔鬚呢，他滿嘴油膩，把口閉得緊緊的，耳朶裏面充滿着響聲，兩頰被炸蕃　脹得鼓起來。他忍住着；可是如果雷辟克家的沒有卽刻離開飯桌的話，他便要爆發出來了。因爲人家竟在她的兒子和女兒面前，把她當作賤得不能再賤的東西看待呢！</p>
<p>（更正）昨日紅蘿蔔鬚第三十六行「先以爲禁他飲一事……」係「他先以爲禁飲一事……」之誤植，特此更正。</p>

<h3 id="c21">「外快」解 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 小之</p>
<p>生存在現實的社會裏，「外快」的確已成了一般人的生命線了·昨天碰着一個老同學，談起生活問題。他告訴我，他在某公司任職，一月只有二十塊錢的薪水，但他有一家大小連傭僕八口的擔負，而他竟能很富裕舒適的生活。我問他是怎樣應付的，他說：全告「外快」。</p>
<p>夫「外快」也者，即本份以外之意外的利益之謂也。換言之：是一種繳倖，不應有而靠命運的收獲：是只有權利而絶對沒有責任的便宜事。譬如：我的那位老同學，他一月只拿二十塊錢的薪水，他便當然只須做二十塊錢以内的本份事，而二十塊錢以外的事務，他是不負責任的。雖說他的富裕舒適的生活，究竟還是公司之惠，然而因爲這是「外快」所以便沒有盡負責任的義務·又譬如：一個貪污的官吏，他拚死命在老百姓頭上刮脂膏，而他儘可以不必有甚麽政績，這也便　是因爲他所刮得的不是本份的俸给，而的的確確是「外快」的缘故。</p>
<p>現在來舉幾個實例，以明究竟何者爲之「外快。」</p>
<p>瀋陽失陷之夕，我們張少帥家的幾千條「金條」便同時爲日人沒收了去。但後來據說，錦州一送，「金條」便物歸原主。少帥送去一塊錦州，而復得他的「金條」·這失而復得「金條」、就呌做「外快」；（二）我們的少帥（對不起，這裏我還要借重我們的少帥），他丢了東北，因以便丢了他的副總司令綏靖主任以及代副分委長等等之類的官職，這固然是件極可傷心的事。但少帥倒能藉此得着空閒和機會跑到歐洲去打洋高而夫，注射洋嗎啡，抱洋舞女，……而且臨行還帶去件把無價的古董國粹，拍賣掉一所海軍醫院，當然這些對於我們的少帥是不無小補的，而這些也正是少帥丢官的「外快」（三）湯將軍逃出承德，好些人便主張拖他來殺掉，可是他終於很幸福的沒有死，現在還兼任着軍長和某某縣長。這「幸福」當然是湯將軍的「外快」；（四）政府抽人民的捐稅，乃是因爲要替人民做事·四川省的稅，已征至民國六十年。民國二十二年的年頭，政府當然不會而且無從着手替人民做民國六十年時代的事，所以乾脆說：這征過頭的稅，是四川省政府的「外快」丨其他如平津知識份子「知道」華北很危險，主張古物應當要南運，學校應當要南遷，命亦應當向南逃……這聰敏的「知道」，乃是知識上的「外快」。至先生大人們平素做了極大的虧心事，於是便吃素唸經設道場法壇，</p>
<p>想將來不致有惡報應，這更是想「找外快」！</p>
<p>然而有些「外快」却是極不幸的！譬如：東北三千萬同胞明明白白的的確確是中國人，而現在竟意外的硬要他們做日人鐡蹄下的「滿洲」人：四川人民納稅至民國六十年，而一年中却偏要逃二三次的兵荒，甚至於要做二三次炮火下的寃鬼丨這不幸而不應有的收獲，是極痛苦的「外快」！</p>
<p>鳴呼！中國人，無論快樂與不幸·都在競於靠着「外快」過生活，或是拚命在想「找外快」，此中國宜乎爲今日之中國也！</p>
<h3 id="c22">旅館之秘密 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 毓賢</p>
<p>旅館者，即前之所謂仕商行臺，所以便利旅客，似無秘密存在其間：但是咱們號稱東方巴黎的旅館反乎是：五層六層的大旅館年年增加，裝飾務求美觀，式樣務求摩登，於是旅客並不是道地貨而變爲開開白相者矣：旅館之秘密亦由此而生。</p>
<p>昨天因爲送朋友到重慶去，咱土老兒也踏進了開開白相的旅館，一間像我小樓一般大的房間，每日賣價大洋七元，誰說中國窮，眞是坐井觀天，上海的旅館不是天天掛着客滿牌嗎！</p>
<p>我們在片刻之際，甬道中送來一陣高跟皮鞋聲，同時在門縫裏飛進一張彩色的紙片，土老兒終究是土老兒，捷足搶來觀看，却是女相士的廣告，上言道：</p>

<p>能拍馬處須拍馬</p>
<p>可吹牛時快吹牛</p>
<p>寓跑馬廳ＸＸ飯店Ｘ百Ｘ十Ｘ號。　　正中更印上美目盻兮的肖像，好像告訴人家請認淸商標，庶不致誤。</p>
<p>我不由記起昨天報載楊聞鶯被殺案的餘波，不是涉及這位，「保重人格名譽」之ＸＸ嗎；因語涉穢褻，恕不贅述。大概讀者沒有忘却去年陳新齋的人犬相交案件，這被殺案中也有同樣的事件。</p>
<p>現在不問事實是否如此，我至少對這彩色的廣告，發生許多疑點：</p>
<p>（一）每天翻報紙，跑馬路，不見這類談相的廣告，而徧由妙齡女子向各旅館分發。</p>
<p>（二）印上自已的肖像，是否像貨品一樣請談相者衔品評優劣？雖然報上也見過眞左筆的肖照，因爲他是以左筆爲號召，她們這雙含睇欲凝的雙目，難道也是談相的技能？</p>
<p>（三）「除談相外，謝絶一切應酬，」及「敬却非分之賜」二語，更開廣告之新紀錄。我不見造屋請醫生，談相是談相，何必特此註明「謝絶一切應酬」：致於「敬却非分之賜」，更不知何所見而云然：</p>
<p>（四）她們的大本營均寓於ＸＸ飯店，我當然不能武斷以飯店爲談相所就是不道行，但是上海的旅館已公認是秘密的所在，以「相金祇取二元」之相士，而開上大少爺白相相的旅館　不知如何「謀生活之自救」？</p>
<p>後來門縫中還不斷的飛進ＸＸＸ按摩院的廣告，上海終究是上海，牠有四季不斷的新玩意兒産生，我希望若干時之後，或者就是明天，上海的房屋都改建爲旅館，日本打到長江流域的時候，請木屐來玩玩上海的花樣鏡，保他們此問樂不思蜀丨就此停山進攻南粤丨</p>
<h3 id="c24">化身博士 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— 旰</p>
<p>從東洋兵陷熱河，轟長城，平津震盪之餘，要人，專家都齊聲說武力懸殊，國勢莫敵；其實東洋兵殺人兇器雖是利害，而骨子裏大家老早安排了敵人進攻的順利條件，再加上幾套退兵一戰的穿挿，恰好雙方諒解，心照不宣。</p>
<p>事情的確可以保險，在目前，似乎除了鴉片薰心的將軍以外，效法李鴻章的究竟不多，雖然秘藏這種企圖的尙大有人在，總不致伸出𩓐子喊一聲「主人請進」。可是中國人材輩出，不讓江漢好專美於前的文人博士，亦感愛（？）國不敢後人，雖未敢明目張膽，投毒於井，害死四萬萬同胞。而躱在背後殺幾下花槍，和東洋兵摇相呼應，的確可能幹得來，問題只怕中國人心未死，那就糟糕。</p>
<p>最近燕趙故址，文化名城，有一怪焉，其爲人也，非仙非神，若魑若魅，出身於金元後裔，托跡中華，玩其生花之筆，大做其國難訃文：首則主張踵國聯之門，叩求共管，可恨倭鬼太不解事，一味横强，硬爭獨佔。於是計上心來，摇身一變，儼然漢族衣冠，煞像東洋博士。從而倒其毛錐，殺轉頭來喊呌：我們已被逼上梁山一（注意，不是博士上梁山）看下文似乎至少要來個浴血抗戰了。不，讀者放心，博士决不帶你上前線。相反的從東洋「良心」着想，誠然「我們不能昧着良心主張對日宣戰」。並且爲「對得住美國和國聯」，根本的對策自然是「堅持道德上的不承認主義」。相反的暗示就是說不須還手，再挨幾下罷。如果東洋兵硬不罷休，那末祇有忍痛犧牲，因爲「我們可以等候五十年」。當然下文不必再講，救國宏圖。文章妙法，皆盡於此。</p>
<p>夠了夠了！博士旣有如此賣力，雖不全是道地貨，至少心肝已經東洋化。設吾言不謬，將來帝國大功告成，抗日小民，全無饒恕。但博士却可保證高官顯爵，賞賜有嘉。假使博士老而不死，五十年後中華國運隆昌，那時拖着木屐歸來，坐看太平，誠非快事。萬一不幸斯人早逝，國人於追憶之餘，水晶棺材也許有福亨受了。</p>
<p>然而爲博士意想不到的是帝國主義的宰割奴役，已經造下了中國民族革命戰爭的前提，加上日本在導火線燃燒起一把火，這時一種偉大的力量爆發起來，或許「五十年」的期望要打一個大大的折扣了。</p>
<p>那末，博士怎麽辦？祗有再有一個化……别吧？</p>

<p>— 小夥子</p>
<p>聽說，都市文明發達的程度，是以妓院多寡，賭窟盛衰以及綁案黑幕等等演的起勁爲標準。而且它們是成正比例的。上海之所以成爲我國都市中之大都市就正是適應這個公式的道理。換句話說（朋友們，幸毋駡我武斷，或是盲從，或是荒謬不倫：）要想某一地方變成熱鬧，文明的都市，僅有一條路，絶對僅有這一條路，把都市之所以成其爲都市的基本應具的條件，具備起來而使之完全，廣泛普遍，那末，自然會不讓上海專美，甚或駕上海之上而上之，也說不定呢！</p>
<p>南京是咱們貴而且大的中華民國之巍巍一首都，中央黨部設於斯，中央政府設於斯，中央大學亦設於斯，洋人，洋使，洋貨又進出充斥於斯，故得被列爲全國六大都市之一。然而，南京雖名爲都市，而大都之基本應具條件則一向不全。（南京之不如上海熱閙，有人肯定地說，（這是原因中之大焉者）單說妓院罷，吃了「禁令」的虧，不得聽其自由生長，而害和一班大人先生性慾發作起來沒得發洩而拼命向上海跑。躭誤了些不要緊的公事不打緊，可是往返跋踄，風塵之勞，或許有傷政躬，所以這終非遠長之計也，小夥子輙窮爲心憂如　焉！</p>
<p>好了廢止禁娼案。居然已經通過了小夥子恭讀專電至三遍有半，沐手合十，度誠從心靈之深處喊出一聲「救星來了，阿彌陀佛！善哉，善哉，此我佛菩薩顯靈之惠也！」從此，「南京衆生」得普渡矣！然而，怪哉！何以女代表不明大義竟因抗爭而痛哭流涕？女代表的涕涙竟如此易灑而不値錢嗎？那只有天曉得！</p>

<p>「好傢伙，這麽一點兒大便會這樣媚人的，將來大了，……哈哈哈哈！」</p>
<p>於是她巧妙的瞪了他一眼，在他的臉上拍了一下，接上低着頭玩弄着他的銅紐扣，似乎是在害羞，然而看上去還是多情。</p>
<p>「小乖乖，你做我的乾女兒好嗎？」那老爺又在說：「反正你又沒有親生父母，怪可憐的。」</p>
<p>「只要爸爸肯痛我的話，還又什麽不好呢？」</p>
<p>「乖乖，馬上便喊爸爸了。」</p>
<p>另一個沒有留鬚的中年人便高聲的笑說着，因此乾爸爸更樂得可以，不料那一個斜倚在少年人胸前的阿姊却劃着自己的面腮，　着嘴唇裝成一副　臉孔說：</p>
<p>「賤婊子，不害羞的。」</p>
<p>從此以後，她不否眞的就做了那人的乾女兒，到也沒有人知道，就是武貴也不能說得千眞萬確，不過這個老爺却時常給錢或是買衣飾來照顧她，却是眞的。其實這種人也不只一個，幾乎，凡是上了年紀的嫖客們都很願意認她爲義女，所以她的乾爸爸也就很多。然而眞的父親到底是誰，她不知道，當　我們更無從知道。不過據武貴的判斷：那還不是買來的無疑。至於她是否本姓爲楊，當然也是可疑的。</p>
<p>三生活的片斷之一</p>
<p>從此過了兩三年，柳姑娘長得更標緻了。</p>
<p>上面已經說過，因爲生性聰明玲琍的原故，很能夠得人龍愛，所以便有好些「大爺有的是錢」的爺們肯出錢給她到女學堂裏讀書去。雖然女四書和烈女傳之類並不能感化她成爲一個頂好的大家閨秀，可是從此能夠硬記幾個生字到是眞的。加以她又是那麽聰明，於是在她的成績上很足以與目下　報上的一高材生」相等。這一點，總很可證明她是出人頭地的吧。</p>
<p>然而讀書儘管讀書，可是正事總還是正事；坐在陌生的男人身上點火裝烟固不必說，就是彈琵琶唱戲也是日常生活在不能缺少的課程。她學會了許多昆曲不必說，就是彈琵琶唱戲也是日常生活在不能缺少的課程。她學會了許多昆曲，也彈得一手很好的三弦，沒有那個敎唱的先生不誇她能幹。其後京戲漸漸的在娼門中風行起來，於是她又得學會「秦瓊賣馬」或「蘇三起解」以及拉熟「西皮」「二簧」了。</p>
<p>這樣看來，做人眞是不易，就是做一娼妓也是如此困難。</p>

<h3 id="c28">歌星在好萊塢的幸運 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— 仲琴</p>
<p>平考斯貝開了風氣之先</p>
<p>各大明星不得不練歌曲</p>
<p>自從靜片廢棄有聲片盛行之初，影界發覺音樂的重要而感到有聲片中唱歌的必須。但是起先，是沒有現在的劇烈的需用歌星ＲＡＤＩＯＳＴＡＲ。及至近來，我們終不會忘記了的平考斯貝，他以歌星出身第一個在影壇上占着萬人瞻仰他的歌聲的榮譽。經過了平考斯貝的興起，好萊塢各影業公司，都一時出巨大的薪金向音樂界中收羅歌星，於是在近來的一個時代，是歌星們在好萊塢的最幸運的時期，也是發現了有聲片後所不能免的大趨勢。</p>
<p>平考斯貝在好萊塢也不過三年的歷史。他初在好萊塢時　第一次的歌是ＢＲＡＤＣＡＳＴ一首中的一段，祗有一隻單獨的琵琶和音。因爲他的噪子是美國音樂界有名的，他的第一次出馬，也受了許多評家「繞梁三日」的稱贊。這首歌就挿在派拉蒙出品「播音大會」ＴＨＥＢＩＧＢＲＯＡＤＳＣＡＳＴ一片中，而平考斯貝也因此受了派拉蒙正式聘爲演員。</p>
<p>繼平考斯貝而起的歌星是凱德絲密斯，ＫＡＴＥＳＲＮＩＴＨ。她在百老匯音樂總會奏藝時，雖然她往往非到深夜沒有暇上臺，但是甚之等到東方發白，歌迷們未嘗散去一人。她的歌的魔力，也可以驚人了。派拉蒙慕她的名，出了重金請了她到影界裏來。她進派拉蒙後，祇做了一部影片，是ＨＥＬＬＯＥＶＥＲＹＢＯＤＹ，也和平考斯貝一樣以歌星而成爲影星。好萊塢請歌星來當演員的，以派拉蒙公司爲嚆矢。</p>
<p>派拍蒙公司的二個歌星，很得評論家的贊許，所以，福克斯，雷電華，華納兄弟，哥倫比亞等各大公司也相繼延聘　老匯音樂界知名之歌星，同時電影明星之兼爲歌星者，地位登時躍起。在這時，影界人物無不爭相練習噪子，以冀維持在影壇上的地位，即如葛萊秦嘉寳約翰吉爾勃也不得不練習唱歌，幾至有不能歌者不足爲影壇人物的趨向。</p>
<p>及至晚近，好萊塢崇尙歌星之風氣更盛極一時，在本年一月以來，歌星們到好萊塢進影界的，約有二十餘人，並且薪給都要比普通的電影明星高。因此大鼻先生傑美杜倫也常常到音樂院中去練習唱歌，雖似滑稽，然風尙所及，可見一般矣。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c29">評「禍水」 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>故事導演平常</p>
<p>其餘尙多可取</p>
<p>波拉尼格麗ＰＯＬＡＮＥＧＲＩ的有聲片，可眞不多，而且她的聲譽，也遠不如四五年前的紅了。昨天新光映的「禍水」ＡＷＯＭＡＮＣＯＭＭＡＮＤＳ裏見着了她，她已老多了。她飾一個歌女，鍾情一個少年軍官，而少年軍官也爲了討好於歌女，不但傾家蕩産，並且債台高築。所以她拿出自己的飾物，代他償還債務，並且離開他，重操鬻歌之藝。不久國王私服出遊，一見之下，大加欣賞，請她入宫赴宴，不久又立她爲皇后，但是國中軍民，久怨國王無道，羣起革命，而國王死，她身爲國后，照刑亦死，但是少年軍官，代爲設計緩頰，雙雙離境而去。</p>
<p>她全部表演，都極優越，幾個特寫的内心表情，也頗能動人情緒。忍痛别去和就位國后時兩幕，把情感理智的衝突，表露無遺。务或王的若即若離，似戀非戀，都恰到好處。唱的兩支曲子，非常悲壯。同一歌曲，一唱再唱，而改換了環境態度，所以連聲調也不同，而不嫌其重復。的確，不但在這片中，她是佔了首席，就是好萊塢女星中，也很少人能及到她的吧？</p>
<p>少年軍官巴西兒萊斯賓ＢＡＳＩＬＲＡＴＨＢＥＮＥ是一個很普通的風流小生，面部很少表情，不過事實上，在全片裏，他尙稱職。飾皇帝的羅蘭特楊ＲＯＬＡＮＤＹＯＵＮＧ眞是妙極了。描寫一個好色昏的國王　　好萊塢滑稽明星</p>
<h3 id="c30">惠勒及胡爾賽 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— 桀克</p>
<p>今日午後抵滬</p>
<p>雷電華影戲公司一對有名的滑稽明星惠勒ＨＥＢＥＲＴＷＨＥＥＬＥＲ及胡爾賽ＲＯＨＥＲＴＷＯＯＬＳＥＲＹ將於今日（星期六）午後乘船抵滬。他們現在乘着假期週游世界，在上海勾留一星期之久，雷電華公司上海經理處預備在他們到滬的時候予以盛大的歡迎，在他們觀光東方的巴黎的一星期裏，他預備竭忱招待。雷電華公司駐滬經理處已經組織了一個歡迎委員會，由該公司總理奈特和南怡怡公司總經理何挺然等人主持其事。他們到碼頭的時候將有中國音樂隨同西洋音樂隊奏樂，還要放　多爆竹，以助熱鬧。馬迪汽車公司也預備一輛派克車供給他們遊玩上海時候乘坐，惠勒和胡爾賽主演過的片子有ＰＥＡＣＨＯＲＯＮＯＣＡＮＧＨＴＰＬＡＳＴＥＲＥＤＧＩＲＬＣＲＡＺＹ和尙未公映過的ＨＯＬＤＥＭＪＡＩＬ和ＤＩＰＬＯＭＡＮＩＡＣＳ等等，上海的電影觀衆心目當還沒有忘記罷。</p>
<p>，雖然有過份之處，但是淋漓盡致，呌人稱快。有兩個配角丨一個是歌女的女侍，一個是内務部長丨表演也頗得幽默的眞髓，一言一動都呌人大笑不止。</p>
<p>攝影有不少，非常美觀，最精彩的是歌女在窗前瞻眺街景，冰雪相凝一幕，眞比任何圖畫，還美麗一些。佈景也頗偉大。分幕極緊凑，對白雖多，但是很有興趣，發音淸脆。</p>
<p>全劇始終沒有露出時代背景；如果說是歷史古劇，但是服裝，佈景，對白，多半似現今的。如果是新劇本，那麽爲什麽許多習慣風俗，又似非今日所有，眞有些不倫不類。而且同時羣臣對於國王的態度，也太不成體統，編劇者似乎失檢了。</p>
<p>幸而演員都很好，不然的話，這影片是很平庸，很呆板的一張了。</p>
<h3 id="c31">評「後台老板」ＴＨＥ　ＰＲＯＰＥＲＴＹＭＡＮ <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>舊片雜碎的拚凑</p>
<p>但居然能賣滿座</p>
<p>好些時候以前看過一次「馬路英雄」，不久的過去，南京大戲院開映的「巡捕」，都是卓别麟過去的作品。但是在觀衆對於這位「笑匠大王」的作品十分渴望的情形之下，看着報紙上顯著的廣告，當然是趨之若騖。同樣，在這種機會之下，於是這「後台老板」也就應運而生。</p>
<p>所謂「後台老板」是從卓别麟十幾年前的許多舊片中，拉拉扯扯凑合而成的，當然談不上情節。雖然投機的影片商人，費了極大心血，前前後後連接起來，敎觀衆勉强相信這是「一部」片子，但是其中就沒有一個聯貫的故事。</p>
<p>内容大概是如此。卓别麟先在酒塲中當酒保，鬧了一場。突然遇着了華貴的女人，赴宴會，又鬧一塲，其後參與汽車比賽，他除了上唇的一叢鬍鬚之下，下巴上也生了兩撇，其後又不知怎的又做起舞台的後台老板來，自然又是打幾次架，跌幾交筋斗。（這時下鬍鬚又突然沒有了）最後又做了拳術比賽的公正人，還是大鬧一場。</p>
<p>劇情旣如上述，那末却利桌别麟也就不會有前後一氣的個性的表現，所以也無從批評。</p>
<p>旣然是十幾年前的老片子，映出來自然是稜模不堪，配音也極幼稚。</p>
<p>總之，這部片子是投機的影業商人的惡作劇。可是昨天巴黎幾乎是賣滿座，可是卓别麟也就眞有意想不到之號召力了。</p>

<p>「那是誰呢？」馬希反問。</p>

<p>那天晚上，潘琪是加倍的快樂，因爲在台幕揭起之前，陶樂賽蹻着脚跛行進她的梳妝室。</p>
<p>「我今夜趕來這裏的時候，」陶樂賽說，「我本想拉光你的頭髮的。後來我心回意轉了。我想我已經了却我的心願，現在是你的機會了。你好名，也許你可以成名。至於我呢，我愛潘特。我們明天就可結婚了。」</p>
<p>閉幕之後，皮萊揶往潘琪梳妝室。</p>
<p>「聽着，蜜，」他對潘琪說，「我正要告訴你，我……」</p>
<p>「請說，」潘琪敦促着。</p>
<p>「我想這有點滑稽，」皮萊訥訥說不出口。「不要這已夠使你明白了一」</p>
<p>皮萊把她拉籠來貼緊着他，再把她的臉抬起向着他，他的嘴唇便緩緩地向　她的接着去。這一定不是舞台的吻呀（完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Our Hope for Rural Revival is Fading <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>How to revive China's rural areas? This question has recently attracted serious attention from the nation. The government has now established a Rural Revival Committee. Discussions on this issue are also erupting everywhere. A few months ago, this newspaper's readers' advisory column occasionally published a communication on this issue, which aroused enthusiastic discussion among readers. Only one in ten expressed their opinions, and it lasted for more than a month. From this, it can be seen that the seriousness of this issue today has stimulated everyone's awareness and urgently seeks a solution.</p>
<p>How can China's rural areas be revived today? We believe that in order to solve this problem, one must first grasp its core. What is the root cause of the problems in our country's rural areas today? This should be discussed from two aspects: internal and external. The external cause is the intrusion of international capitalist forces, which dump large quantities of agricultural products. The import amount in the twenty-first year reached more than 348.59 million customs taels. This aspect of the root cause will be set aside. As for the internal causes, years of internal turmoil, frequent floods and droughts, and ever-increasing exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies are all obvious facts. For example, in the Su-Chang area, most peasant families do not have three days' worth of grain. After the great famine in Shaanxi, exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies were not only not reduced, but increased daily. What's worse, recently, the land tax in Sichuan has been collected up to the sixtieth year of the Republic of China. This time, in the name of suppressing the communists, an additional 40 million was levied. Such examples are readily available. There are even more that are many times this number. This is the fundamental cause of the internal illness of our country's rural areas today. Therefore, today, it is fine not to talk about rural relief. If we talk about relief, we should first start by eradicating these root causes of the illness. In other words, at a minimum, we should ensure political integrity and social stability. Only then can we talk about the beginnings of rural revival. This is the first key to talking about rural relief today.</p>
<p>What's more, we today hope that the government must have a complete plan and implementation steps for rural revival. The work of rural revival is closely related to transportation, water conservancy, and so on. In other words, rural revival is only one aspect of the overall political situation. If the overall political situation is not rectified and cleared up, then empty talk of revival will be of no help. Today, some people admire the success of the Soviet Union's agricultural industrialization. However, the reason why the Soviet Union achieved this is also due to the entire Five-Year Plan. Under the overall plan, various departments developed in a balanced manner, complementing and helping each other, and the industrialization of agriculture was able to be successfully completed. The reason for this is something that can be deeply considered.</p>
<p>Secondly, now that the government has established a Rural Revival Committee, it must have the determination to make efforts to implement the revival policies. In the past, the government formulated an outline for the implementation of agricultural policies at the National Assembly. The main points were to encourage agricultural production, develop forestry, build water conservancy projects, promote rural cooperation, and improve the lives of farmers. All of these were important plans for rural relief. If they had been earnestly followed for the past two years, it would not have been impossible to achieve the effect of rural revival. But what is the reality after the promulgation of this outline? Therefore, what we value today is not the ability to speak, but the ability to act. The establishment of the Rural Revival Committee today is of great significance. But what we cannot help but worry about is that we are truly afraid that it will unfortunately still follow the same old path of making resolutions but not implementing them. In addition, the Revival Committee should hire more experts, not recruit "celebrities." Being pragmatic is also an important task today.</p>
<p>Finally, a country has its own economic background, and one cannot generalize by analogy. The rural panic in the United States today is completely different from the rural panic in our country. Their production is in a state of anarchy, with overproduction and unequal distribution. The rural panic arises from this. Today, the American government is doing everything it can to try to save the situation. Although it is not yet known whether it can save this raging tide, the peace and tranquility of American politics and the strength of its economic power are not comparable to those of our country. The illness of our country today is due to political instability, social unrest, and the extreme economic distress of farmers. Whether the American relief methods are applicable to our country, and whether our country can imitate the policies of capitalist countries to relieve rural areas, are things that we cannot help but ask the government to pay attention to the actual situation of our country today and carefully consider.</p>
<p>Japan Uses the Sino-Soviet Railway as a Threat</p>
<p>To Force Russia to Recognize the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Proposes to Form a Joint Tripartite Committee to Resolve Disputes</p>
<p>The Puppet State, Taking Advantage of Power, Limits Russia to Returning Vehicles, Otherwise Taking Decisive Action</p>
<p>Twenty-Three Russians Deported</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When the Russian ambassador met with Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Arita yesterday, Vice Foreign Minister Arita protested to the Russian ambassador, saying that the Japanese government was very willing to resolve the disputes between Russia and the "Manchu" states peacefully regarding the Sino-Soviet Railway and Russia. If it is desired to resolve various pending cases, a joint committee should be organized by Russia, "Manchu," and Japan. All disputes should be submitted to the committee for discussion to find a peaceful solution. The Russian ambassador replied that Russia has always adopted a peaceful policy towards friendly nations and that the spirit of the proposal is originally the same, but hopes that Japan will clearly state the specific measures in separate articles of the proposal so that it can be submitted to its own government for instructions. Vice Foreign Minister Arita made an appointment with the Russian ambassador for another meeting in the future to discuss the specific case with the Foreign Minister and then seek to discuss it with the Russian ambassador at the Foreign Ministry. The Russian ambassador left at 4 pm. Regarding the Sino-Soviet Railway issue, the Japanese government does not dare to go to war with Russia because of this, but only wants to use this issue as a threat to make Russia substantially recognize the puppet organization it created.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry held a department meeting this morning. Foreign Minister Uchida, Vice Foreign Minister Arita, and all department heads attended to discuss the original plan of the joint committee of Russia, "Manchu," and Japan. According to the Eastern Report, the original plan proposed by the Foreign Ministry is divided into five major outlines. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In order to deal with the disputes between Russia and "Manchu," a joint committee of Russia, Japan, and "Manchu" will be organized. This committee will be a permanent body, divided into military and non-military departments, holding separate meetings to deal with relevant matters. (2) The members of this body, "Manchu," will appoint the heads of the Foreign Ministry and the Army Ministry as members, Russia will appoint the embassy counselor, military attache, and consul as members. Japan will appoint members from the Kwantung Army and the embassy counselor and the special affairs agency stationed in Manchu to form a joint committee. (3) Offices will be established in Harbin, Manzhouli, and Suifenhe. (4) The duties of the joint committee are to deal with the borders and all disputes between Russia, Japan, and "Manchu" and seek peaceful solutions. (5) Regarding border issues, the joint committee will create a border investigation committee to jointly be responsible for investigating relevant matters.</p>
<p>It is heard that the plan will be sent to the Army Ministry and the General Staff Headquarters. If the military agrees, it will be formally proposed to Russia around May 10. (China United Press, 5th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Pseudo-state Transportation Department Director Morita of the Railway Department and Mori, the head of the Sino-Soviet Railway Section, arrived in Harbin by plane from Changchun yesterday to secretly discuss everything with Li (rebel) Shaogeng. This is because of the protest from the Soviet Russian side on April 28. The pseudo-state's reply, which limits the deadline for the Soviet Union to return the vehicles, is approaching, but the Soviet Russian side has not shown any remorse. Therefore, it was decided to issue a warning and explain the fundamental principles regarding ownership. The summary is as follows: (1) The Sino-Russian Agreement and the Feng Russian Agreement were concluded due to Soviet Russian pressure. Therefore, it is inappropriate to say that the Sino-Soviet Railway is owned by the Soviet Union based on this. The Sino-Soviet Railway is jointly managed, and ownership is not unilateral. (2) The sealing of Manzhouli in accordance with the direct cargo agreement between the Sino-Soviet Railway and the Trans-Baikal Railway is a violation of this agreement. It should be known that this agreement only concerns the transportation of soybeans and is only temporary. (3) It is said that there is a direct connection right in accordance with the construction contract, but this refers to the direct connection between the Sino-Soviet Railway and the Ussuri Railway, not that the Trans-Baikal Railway has an agreement. (4) A one-month deadline of April 12 is set, requesting the return of locomotives and freight cars, but the Soviet Russian side does not show sincerity in this regard. Therefore, a warning is issued again. (5) If the locomotives and freight cars are not returned before the deadline, "Manchukuo" will take decisive action and seal off Bokerani Tskinoia to urge it to reflect. It is heard that if the Soviet Russian response to this warning is still not to return the vehicles, the pseudo-state will take effective measures to block Bokerani Tskinoia to urge it to reflect.

<p>Japan Hides Behind the Scenes, Actually Benefiting Japan</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to official reports here, Soviet Russian Vice Foreign Minister Karakhan met with Japanese Ambassador Ota on April 24. Karakhan stated that the Soviet Union was eager to resolve the Sino-Soviet Railway dispute directly with Japan, and said that Japan excused itself by saying that the case should be resolved by the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo" and that it was not related to Japan, which was actually not beneficial to Japan.

<p>Japan's Militarism</p>
<p>Loses International Credibility</p>
<p>Ishii Will Hit a Snag When He Arrives in the United States</p>
<p>(New York) The "People's Voice Forum News" talked about the departure of Japanese representative Viscount Ishii and others to Washington and London, saying that the Roosevelt government has an obligation that it is not happy with but cannot avoid, that is, to clearly state to Viscount Ishii the attitude of various countries on the mainland towards the recent events in the Far East in Japan, especially regarding Japan's denial of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and its disregard for the desire of the powers to maintain peace in the Far East. According to the newspaper, the only result that can be expected from the talks of the Japanese delegation in Washington is that the Tokyo government can use it to fully understand the views of other countries. The Japanese military believes that Japan has increased its credibility in the international community, but the Japanese delegation may be greatly disappointed after arriving in Washington.

<p>In the British House of Commons</p>
<p>MacDonald Reports on His Trip to the United States</p>
<p>Close Cooperation Between the United Kingdom and the United States on Disarmament Issues</p>
<p>Hope for a Tariff Truce to Be Guaranteed</p>
<p>No Compromise on War Debts, Further Discussions Needed</p>
<p>(London) It was expected that the British Prime Minister would make an important announcement in the House of Commons this afternoon, so many people attended the meeting. When the Prime Minister stood up and reported on his trip to the United States, all parties applauded him. The Prime Minister said that his talks with President Roosevelt in Washington were very satisfactory. As a result, the two countries will participate in the World Economic Conference to be held on June 12 with free means. He has explained to the US President that although he welcomes the tariff truce, its application in the United Kingdom must be guaranteed, because the United Kingdom's position is different from that of countries with high tax rates. The economic defense policies of other countries have been actively implemented. The success of the disarmament talks has been seen in the existing practical cooperation between the British and American representatives in Geneva. As for war debts, he has not been able to say much, because this necessary event has not yet reached the compromise stage. The hospitality of the United States during this trip is very grateful. Opposition leader Lansbury pointed out that the British Prime Minister's words were vague and simple and said that the people should know what policies the government will propose at the World Economic Conference. Liberal Party member Lambert asked whether the war debt issue would be submitted to the World Economic Conference. The British Prime Minister replied in the negative. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) Although Prime Minister MacDonald stated in the House of Commons today that the war debt issue would be discussed separately from the World Economic Conference, according to news obtained by London political circles today, the investigation on war debts will be conducted simultaneously with the conference. More information on MacDonald's talks with President Roosevelt will be revealed at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. Foreign Minister Eden will also attend the meeting. Eden has returned to Beijing from Geneva to report on the situation of the disarmament conference. It is heard that if the tariff truce proposal is implemented, any country that wants to change its tax regulations must obtain permission from the economic conference. If this is the case, a body will be established to handle this matter. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Will Go to Geneva in Person</p>
<p>To Prevent the Disarmament Conference from Stalling</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister MacDonald believes that the success of the economic conference depends on the success of the disarmament conference. Therefore, he urgently telegraphed British representative Ai at the disarmament conference, ordering him to return to China to report on the work of the disarmament conference. Since Germany raised its request on the issue of military quotas, the situation has been worrying. One of the main British cabinet members, or even Prime Minister MacDonald himself, may soon go to Geneva in person to find ways to prevent the predictable extension of the disarmament conference. MacDonald's efforts are very much in line with those of US representative Davis. When the Prime Minister met with Davis this morning, he considered the joint actions of the United Kingdom and the United States. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>

Prime Minister Xu Dang will go to meet Hesse in his private capacity. After Hesse arrives at Harvard, he will take a special train back to Paris and arrive at 10:30. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Tariff Truce Law Attached with Reservations</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Philips announced that the French government has proposed three reservations on the tariff truce: (1) France retains the freedom to increase tariffs in the event of a foreign currency falling; (2) the tariff truce does not apply to various commercial treaties that have already been submitted to Congress for consideration; (3) the tariff truce will only take effect after all major countries have accepted it. The above reservations were notified to the US government by the French ambassador to the United States. (Havas News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) US government officials expressed deep disappointment today at the slow response of European countries to the tariff truce proposal, but they also acknowledged that the weak and volatile price of the US dollar was a major reason for the slow response of various countries. The State Council was surprised that the US move to reduce tariffs could not take effect immediately. Today, several people have expressed surprise that the proposal to temporarily not increase tariffs has not been fully accepted without reservations. However, US officials are hoping that the United Kingdom will adhere to the spirit of the communique issued jointly by Prime Minister MacDonald and President Roosevelt in Washington. Once MacDonald has discussed the situation of the Washington talks with his cabinet members, he will take action immediately as the first to initiate the truce. It is not easy to obtain the immediate endorsement of all European countries, because several countries are currently negotiating special restrictive treaties with other countries. As for the gold price, if it is not certain that the volatility of the exchange market is a major obstacle to other countries accepting the truce, the US government may not take any action to stabilize the gold price before the London Conference.

<p>Commemoration of the Founding of the Revolutionary Government</p>
<p>Sun Ke Reports on the Difficult Struggles of the Premier</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Speaks About Recalling the Revolutionary Spirit of the Premier</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The 5th is the twelfth anniversary of the founding of the Revolutionary Government. All government agencies, groups, and schools in the capital are given a day off. Newspapers are also suspended for a day. The entire city flies flags to celebrate. The Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and all sectors of the capital held commemorative meetings separately in the morning. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a commemoration meeting for the founding of the Revolutionary Government at 8:00 a.m. on the 5th. Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Sun Ke, Dai Chuanxian, Shi Ying, Chen Lifu, Huang Musong, Ma Chaojun, Zheng Zhannan, Dai Kuisheng, Xie Zuomin, Gu Zhenggang, Miao Peicheng, Deng Jiayan, and others, as well as all staff members and representatives of various agencies, totaling approximately 600 people, attended. The meeting began with music, chaired by Sun Ke, who led the ceremony. Sun Ke gave a speech, the original text of which is as follows: Fellow comrades, today is the twelfth anniversary of the founding of the Revolutionary Government. To commemorate the day when the Premier took office as the Extraordinary President in Guangzhou, we cannot but recall the history of the Revolutionary Government's struggle in Guangzhou from 1921 to 1924. In 1921, the Northern Warlords Cao and Wu were in power, holding the Chinese government and destroying the revolutionary forces. In order to carry out the revolutionary purpose, the Premier returned to Guangzhou from Shanghai. At that time, some congressmen followed the Premier back to Guangzhou. After the Premier returned to Guangzhou, in order to establish a revolutionary central force to maintain the revolutionary movement with the formal highest authority for internal and external affairs, he advocated the speedy establishment of the Revolutionary Government. At that time, Chen Jiongming was in charge of Guangdong Province, but Chen Jiongming had colluded with Cao and Wu and secretly opposed the establishment of the Revolutionary Government in Guangzhou. Although Chen Jiongming opposed it in this way, in order to carry out his revolutionary advocacy, the Premier held the ceremony of taking office as the Extraordinary President on May 5, 1921. We still remember that on the day the Revolutionary Government was founded, hundreds of thousands of people in Guangzhou participated in a grand parade and enthusiastically expressed their approval. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Government, the Premier actively prepared to send troops north. At that time, Chen Jiongming secretly undermined the revolutionary movement in Guangdong. Therefore, in the autumn of that year, the Premier led a part of the army and comrades from other provinces to Guilin, Guangxi, as the base camp to prepare to send troops to Hunan. Later, the Premier learned that the internal situation in Guangdong was unstable and was deeply afraid that Chen Jiongming would surrender to the Northern Warlords. Therefore, he decided to withdraw his troops from Guilin to Guangzhou to suppress the rebellion. In 1922, the Premier returned to Guangzhou to prepare to send troops from Guangdong to Jiangxi. At that time, Chen Jiongming expressed his obedience on the surface, but in fact, he was actively resisting. Therefore, Chen Jiongming himself expressed his resignation and removed himself from his various positions before the Premier returned and left Guangzhou, indicating that he would not participate in the Northern Expedition movement. After Chen Jiongming left the Premier, he continued to actively resist secretly. On June 16 of that year, he rebelled in Guangzhou, causing the Premier to suffer misfortune. In August of 1922, the Premier returned to Shanghai and ordered the various armies in Guangxi to move east to expel the rebel Chen. In the winter of 1922, when the army was launched from the West River, it defeated the rebel army. In 1923, the Premier returned to Guangdong again, reorganized the base camp, and continued the task of the Northern Expedition. The position of the Revolutionary Government in Guangdong from 1923 to 1924 was the most difficult, because at that time, the revolutionary forces only reached Guangzhou, Chen rebel occupied the East River, and the other Northern Jiangxi was not subject to the orders of the Revolutionary Government. At that time, the revolutionary forces could only rely on a corner of Guangzhou to maintain. At the same time, because the Revolutionary Government wanted to resist the Northern Warlords and withhold Guangdong customs duties, it aroused the resistance of the imperialists. The United Kingdom assisted the Northern Warlords in negotiating with the Revolutionary Government and sent warships to intimidate them. At the same time, it colluded with the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce to create a reactionary force to overthrow the Revolutionary Government. At that time, the Revolutionary Government in Guangzhou had to go through a very difficult struggle to eliminate all kinds of reactionary labor forces. After the Premier went north, the reactionary forces in Guangdong gradually disappeared. When we recall this history of difficult struggle in the years after the establishment of the Revolutionary Government, it is more difficult than the position of our party and country today. We must inherit the Premier's great spirit and strive forward. Since the September 18th Incident, our comrades have often become pessimistic because they have been subjected to this kind of aggression and oppression by Japanese imperialism, and because the country cannot unite and often has external failures, thinking that the party and country have no way out and that the future seems very dark. The brothers believe that the environment we are in now is certainly difficult, but the difficulty at this time is not as difficult as when the Premier was in Guangzhou. Now the political power in the country is still in the hands of our party. We already have various forces such as politics and military affairs. We cannot say that there are too many difficulties and we cannot break through the situation. As long as we can restore the great spirit of the Premier in establishing the Revolutionary Government in Guangzhou and organizing the revolutionary movement and carry it forward, all difficulties can be broken. Therefore, today we commemorate the establishment of the Revolutionary Government, we must restore the Premier's revolutionary spirit, consolidate the revolutionary forces, concentrate the revolutionary forces of the national people, resist the aggression of the imperialists externally, and eliminate all the evil forces that destroy the revolutionary front internally, so that the country and the nation can continue to survive, and the revolutionary mission can be completed in accordance with the Premier's legacy. This is the important responsibility that all of our comrades should have the determination to shoulder today in commemorating the Premier's establishment of the Revolutionary Government in Guangzhou. (Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a commemoration meeting for the founding of the Revolutionary Government at 5:00 a.m. on the 5th. Chairman Lin and the heads of various departments and committees, civil officials, and military counselors attended the meeting. Chairman Lin led the ceremony and gave a report entitled "Recalling the Revolutionary Spirit of the Premier to Save the Current National Crisis." The original text is as follows: Everyone, today is the anniversary of the founding of the Revolutionary Government. This anniversary is the day when the Premier took office as the Extraordinary President in Guangzhou. Originally, the Premier was completely responsible for the revolutionary cause. For decades, he ran around without leisure and suffered hardships. He was only responsible for the Republic of China and had no thought of rights. We remember that the Premier first took office as the Provisional President on January 1, the first year of the Republic of China, after the Wuchang Uprising was completed. When the Premier returned from overseas and arrived in Shanghai, the first issue he discussed with his comrades was to build the Republic of China. First, we must unify China. To unify China, we must first start with the organization of the Presidential Palace. At that time, many people did not understand this meaning. I remember that during the discussion of the presidential issue, someone proposed the system of Grand Marshal and Deputy Marshal. They thought that although the Wuchang Uprising was said to be successful, it had not yet reached the north, and it was still in the name of Grand Marshal and Deputy Marshal to lead the situation. Their advocacy completely did not understand the Premier's meaning. They did not know that the Premier really had a lot of hard work at that time. Later, after Mr. Chen Yingshi explained to the general comrades, the proposal to abandon the Grand Marshal and Deputy Marshal was finally approved, and the name Provisional President was used. In this way, we know the Premier's spirit of advancing bravely in the revolution throughout his life. Even if there are mistakes, they are all due to the comrades' incomprehension, and this is the twist when the Premier first served as Provisional President. On May 5, the tenth year of the Republic of China, when he served as Extraordinary President in Guangzhou, there was also a very solemn discussion beforehand, but there were also some people who did not understand the Premier's meaning and obstructed it. Now we remember that there are a few words in the Premier's legacy, saying that people should aim to do great things, not to be high officials. What is this great thing? In simple terms, it is the National Revolution, which is to demand the independence, freedom, and equality of China. People who do not understand the Premier's meaning think that the Premier has already served as the Provisional President and has already ceded to Yuan Shikai, so under the banner of protecting the law, it is better to use the name of Grand Marshal to organize the Grand Marshal's Office and the Base Camp. They thought that this would allow them to continue and support the precarious situation. They only knew that Guangzhou was the birthplace of the revolution, but they did not know that it must be developed and expanded from the birthplace before it could unify China. The Premier's work of the Northern Expedition was to unify China. If China is not unified, it will always be a precarious situation no matter what. At the same time, some people advocated the theory of inter-provincial autonomy, but it was not a solution. Therefore, before May 5, the tenth year of the Republic of China, the issue of the presidency was discussed in Guangzhou for almost more than a month, and there were still many people who came out to obstruct it, advocating to stay in a precarious situation and not develop outwards. The Premier had to struggle in such a difficult environment, and had to bravely come forward and take the post of Extraordinary President. This expression of spirit is to be responsible for the Northern Expedition, to complete the unification, and to enable China to embark on the road of independence, freedom, and equality. However, in the end, because some people were not devoted to the Premier's beliefs and did not implement them effectively, they hindered many workers and did not urge the Premier forward in a unified manner. This is really regrettable. The Premier devoted his life to the revolution, day after day for decades, but he rarely received the assistance of the majority of the people, so that the Three People's Principles have not been realized today, because everyone does not pay attention to carefully studying, and there is a suspicion, such as the protection of the law, the general senators in Beiping all arrived in Guangzhou to hold a meeting, and then organized a constitutional drafting meeting, after several months of discussion, the constitution will be completed, suddenly someone came out to destroy, thinking that once the constitution is completed, Guangzhou will become a formal situation, so they do not hesitate to engage in destruction by cruel means. These people who destroy are also knowledgeable and capable people, only because they do not have a long-term vision, they see their own interests, they do not see the interests of the country, they are content and lucky, they try to survive, they delay the country, to this day. Today, we are holding this meeting, recalling that the Premier was so responsible to the country, so struggling for the revolution, and so painstakingly explaining to comrades and the people who do not understand. Today, some of our armed comrades are fighting desperately with the enemy on the front line, and some are making great sacrifices in suppressing bandits. Our comrades in the rear should bravely move forward with the Premier's fearless spirit, break through difficulties, stand on a battle line with the armed comrades on the front line, and fight to the end, so that the national crisis can be resolved.

<p>Nona's Biography</p>
<p>The President of Hunan Political Science University, Luo Jie, once wrote a biography of Nona, describing his revolutionary experiences and miraculous deeds as follows: He is called the Three Hutuktu and the Seventh Hobilghan, named Chengli Jiamucuo, now a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Nona Hutuktu. Tibetan soldiers regard him as a divine person, and the people of Xikang admire him as a pioneer of the revolution. Hobilghan means reincarnation. Nona entered Beijing in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China to receive orders. During his spare time discussing Kang affairs, he spread the Dharma and healed diseases, attracting a large number of people. He did not claim any supernatural powers, but single-mindedly focused on matters of principle, encouraging his disciples to endure hardship and uphold precepts as the foundation. People in the capital all praised him, vying to meet him. In Tibetan Buddhism, the Exoteric Buddhism was founded in ancient times, known as Po Mu. At the end of the Zhou Dynasty, the Xueshan Temple was built. Esoteric Buddhism was founded in the Eastern Jin Dynasty. Five Indian masters, especially Hua Sheng Dashi, greatly prospered it. The great ten reincarnations faced dangers and difficulties in successive lifetimes, spreading compassion widely. The five divisions of Buddha, Golden Lotus, and Vajra were able to be greatly promoted and have not declined to this day. Tibetan people are known for their bravery and skill in battle. Gradually, they learned the teachings of compassion, forbearance, and humility, mostly worshiping Buddhism, cherishing peace and tranquility, which gradually became their custom. Tibet is largest in the Front and Back Tibet, followed by Xikang. Xikang is centered in Batang. The eastern regions of Batang, where thirty-three counties were established during the Qing Dynasty, still retain the old system of Tusi. In the Batang area, the four Hutuktus still concurrently manage politics and religion. The four Hutuktus are Basu, Chaya, Qamdo, and Leiwuqi, with Leiwuqi being the largest. Its territory borders the twenty-five tribes of Qinghai to the north, and the central part of Baimagang to the south. Qamdo is the middle arm, Danda Mountain is the left arm, and Basu and Chaya are located in the southeast, with the thirty-nine tribes shielding the northwest. It is truly a sacred land of the Red Sect. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, they were conferred the title of Nomunhan. During the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty, the title was changed to Grand Hutuktu. During the fifty-eighth year of Emperor Qianlong's reign, Sangji Yiji, a monk official of the Nona Temple, assisted General Fukang'an in conquering the Gurkhas, and was conferred the title of Three Hutuktu. The direct transmission of Hua Sheng's ancestor, called Meier Dana, was actually Nona's original teacher. Meier Dana did not concern himself with political affairs, but focused on the three divisions of Esoteric Buddhism, Buddha, Golden Lotus, and Vajra, comprehensively mastering and harmonizing them, compassionately saving sentient beings, and repeatedly demonstrating supernatural transformations. He lived to be over 130 years old, and then passed away after achieving enlightenment. Nona was born in Xiaji in the ugly hour of the fifteenth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar in the fourth year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty (Yi Chou). Because he was a Hobilghan, he was welcomed into the temple at the age of seven. He fully inherited his teacher's essence, possessing profound knowledge of both Exoteric and Esoteric Buddhism, and devoted himself to compassion. At the age of twenty-five, he took over the administration of Leiwuqi. Twelve years later, he and his younger brother went to pay homage to Gongduo Bazhang Mountain in Baimagang. The wild tribes were fierce and cruel, and his brother was killed. The Grand Hutuktu was furious and led Nona to conquer the wild tribes, expanding the territory of Baima, implementing both political and religious governance. After seven years, a rough framework was established, which was presented to the central dynasty. In the first year of the Republic of China, he returned to Leiwuqi with a tin staff. The following year, the Tibetan army invaded Kang, and the Sichuan governor ordered generals to send troops to conquer. Nona and the Grand Hutuktu led troops to assist in the battle, recovering the invaded lands of the thirty-nine tribes and the twenty-five tribes. He had been at odds with the Dalai Lama for seven years. When the Tibetan army launched a full-scale attack, Nona, seeing that Qamdo was surrounded by mountains on all sides and the city was like being at the bottom of a well, worried that if the mountains were occupied by the enemy, they would be trapped and waiting to be captured. He requested that the army led by Peng Risheng move troops to firmly defend the mountain passes and await reinforcements, but his advice was not heeded. Soon, the mountains were all occupied by the enemy. He advised breaking through and retreating to Qinghai, but again his advice was not heeded. Risheng then surrendered his army. Liu, the battalion commander of the Han camp, fought valiantly but was defeated and drowned in the river. Hundreds of soldiers followed him in death. Nona was defeated and captured. The Dalai Lama ordered him to surrender, but he refused. The Dalai Lama then dug a deep pit outside Lhasa, about several feet deep, piled up wood and stone, and covered it with several thatched roofs. Three hundred soldiers were stationed there, leaving a hole only five inches wide. Food and water were lowered once a day. At first, they tried to induce him to surrender, but after a long time, they realized he would not yield. They placed the food on the ground for him. Nona groped for food in the dark cell and eventually died. After several days, he revived. The guards tried to test him by lowering a bundle of straws. Nona groped for the food, and the guards considered him a divine person and no longer placed the food on the ground. Nona fought six battles in the prison, reciting the Buddha's name all day long, focusing his mind on one state. After his daily tasks, he dug the earth with his hands. When he encountered a stone, he changed direction and dug again. After a long time, he created a hole and escaped, seeing the light of day again. Then, he traveled secretly at night, taking the path to India, traversing rugged ridges, begging for food to survive. Whenever he encountered illness, he treated it. Passing through Zhaxi Kong, he cured the daughter of a prince, who had been haunted by demons for a long time, with a curse. The prince, grateful, kept him in the temple. Nona, longing for the interior, devised a plan to send his followers east. Passing through Mumbai, Baloch, and other places, he reached the interior after nine months of hardship. When he was imprisoned in the earthen cell, it was damp, filthy, and the food was meager. Swarms of insects bit him, enough to weaken and kill him. However, Nona survived for six years, returning to life after death, and even used his flesh and blood to replace tools, breaking through solid and thick barriers. The guards had no awareness at all, which was an especially incredible feat. Ding Zipei, a representative of Xikang, said that in the past, the Tibetans worshiped Nona's corpse and built a pagoda, calling him the Holy Emperor. The Dalai Lama thought he was certainly dead. After several years, they suddenly heard that he was still alive. He sent people to secretly seek Nona's portrait, and upon careful examination, it was indeed him. He then beat to death one of the guards. When Nona escaped from the difficult situation, he must have faked his death to show his passing. If it were not for his sincere faith and conduct moving the Buddhas to add their power, how could he have achieved this? I once raised this question to Nona, but he remained silent, perhaps avoiding speaking of supernatural powers. Earlier, Yin Changheng, the governor of Sichuan, ordered General Liu Ruilin to garrison Kang. Ruilin had the courage to resist strong enemies. Former President Yuan Shikai withdrew Changheng back to Sichuan, and Ruilin was dismissed along with him, replaced by Peng Risheng as general. That was in the third year of the Republic of China. Risheng was cowardly and lacked courage. The lands of the thirty-nine tribes were lost due to his inability to defend them. More than half of the Leiwuqi soldiers were killed or injured. For more than a year, they were burdened with extortion and providing for teachers, and aid was cut off. The following year, Shikai and the governor of Sichuan sent troops to Leiwuqi, ordering Nona to go to Lhasa to negotiate the withdrawal of troops. Before the negotiations were completed, Peng's army started a war over a minor matter. The central government was in turmoil, and reinforcements did not arrive. The exhausted and isolated army resisted the enemy for two years, and the territory of Leiwuqi was completely lost. The Grand Hutuktu was captured after exhausting his strength and poisoned to death in Lhasa. Peng Chu, the leader of the thirty-nine tribes, was captured and had his nose cut off. The Second Hutuktu died of fright because the Dalai Lama blamed him for helping the Han people. Nona led more than 700 monks, laypeople, and remnants of the army to retreat to Qamdo with Peng's army, begging for help from Chen Xialing, the garrison commander of Qamdo. Xialing did not respond. All of this was the cause of the defeat in Xikang. In the winter of the thirteenth year, he arrived in Beijing and visited the President of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, but was rejected. He visited the ruling Duan, but the gatekeepers would not let him pass. Nona was filled with grief and indignation, intending to commit suicide by smashing his head in sacrifice for Kang. The soldiers were surprised and stopped him from saving him. He then reached the ruling Duan. The ruling Duan treated him with respect and learned Buddhism from him, promising to send him back to Kang and restore his old possessions. When the ruling Duan stepped down, Liu Fucheng, the Sichuan army border defense governor of the Northern Expedition of the party army, heard of Nona's virtue and respectfully welcomed him into the army, spreading Esoteric Buddhism. More than ten thousand disciples were taught by him. Nona never boasted about himself. His knowledge and ability far surpassed others. People in Beijing who were concerned about Kang affairs heard that Nona was skilled in politics and knew military affairs, disciplined himself with integrity, sacrificed everything, and wholeheartedly sought unity. At first, they thought he was an ordinary person. Later, they learned that he was the reincarnated living Buddha of the seventh generation, and they longed to see him.</p>
<p>Miao Zhongxiu Goes to the United States to Investigate Silk Industry</p>
<p>Jiangzhe Silk Industry Groups Fete Him Yesterday</p>
<p>The General Office of Jiangzhe-Anhui Silk Cocoons and the Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association believe that the United States is the largest consumer of raw silk in the world, importing 550,000 dan of raw silk annually, of which 90% is purchased from Japan. China and Italy, etc., only supply one-tenth. In recent years, the Chinese government and business community have been striving to remedy this situation, and have successively established the Old Silk Sorting Association and Promotion Association. Recently, they have organized the United Sericulture Control Association to unify silkworm breeds and increase cocoon production. However, there is little connection with foreign markets. The Japanese government recently established a Raw Silk Visiting Bureau in New York to vigorously promote Japanese silk sales in the United States, and has also made false propaganda about the Chinese silk industry. The chairman of the General Office and Trade Association, Zhu Jing'an and Shen Huachen, requested Miao Zhongxiu, director of the Raw Silk Inspection Department of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, to go to the United States for practical liaison to promote sales. This plan was sponsored by the Old Silk Promotion Committee and the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Mr. Miao is scheduled to sail on the President Cleveland on the 9th of this month. Yesterday, the General Office of Jiangzhe-Anhui Silk Cocoons, the Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association, and the Jiangzhe Old Silk Promotion Committee specially held a banquet at the Xinya Restaurant on Nanjing Road to see him off. It is reported that in addition to carrying out the above tasks, Mr. Miao also intends to investigate the status of the Japanese and American raw silk inspection offices for reference. After completing his work in the United States, he will return to China via Europe. After arriving in France, he plans to go to Lyon to investigate the silk industry.</p>

Yesterday, Peng Canguang, the general manager of the association, visited Kong Xiangxi, the newly appointed president of the Central Bank, who has just returned from overseas and must have a deep understanding of the situation of overseas Chinese. Mr. Kong personally received him and expressed his great sympathy for the distressed overseas Chinese in Mexico.

<p>Sends Hu Zushun to the North to Promote</p>
<p>丨And Contact to Organize Branches丨</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association yesterday sent letters to Yu Xiaohou, chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, Han Xiangfang, chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, Mr. Feng Huanzhang of Zhangjiakou, the Tianjin Local Association, the Tianjin Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, the Tianjin General Chamber of Commerce, the Jinan General Chamber of Commerce, and others, introducing Hu Yuzhai, a standing director of the association, to go to North China to promote the organization of support association branches. The letter said: "Respected Sirs, the violent Japanese are insatiably encroaching, occupying our three northeastern provinces, seizing our Rehe, and launching a full-scale invasion, dividing their forces in North Hebei, and harassing eastern Chahar. Their ultimate intention is to destroy our country and exterminate our nation. At this extraordinary time for our country, we should all rise up together to save ourselves from danger. Our association has been assisting the volunteer army for a year, and the task is arduous. We can only do our best. In the future, the anti-Japanese work will be at the forefront in North China, and the volunteer army in the interior of the eastern provinces still needs practical assistance. Therefore, at the 140th Standing Committee meeting, it was decided to publicly recommend Mr. Hu Zushun to go to North China to promote the organization of volunteer army support branches. We have always admired (your Taiwan seat is a pillar of the country, a pillar in the middle stream), and your association leads the masses and has a far-reaching reputation. You have a sincere enthusiasm for resisting Japan and saving the country. Therefore, we have prepared this letter to inform you. We hope you will investigate and assist, and we implore you to strongly support Mr. Hu's work so that it can proceed smoothly. We are deeply grateful."</p>

They all traveled by car, so traffic on the roads was intermittently interrupted. Liang's hearse arrived at the Gonghexiang Wharf, where a public memorial service was held. After the ceremony, the coffin was loaded onto a Jardine Matheson Company ship and sailed directly to Guangzhou, where it was transferred to his hometown in Sanshui for burial.

<p>Egyptian Consul to Japan Returns Home, Passing Through Shanghai</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that Dr. Fu Qi, the Egyptian consul in Kobe, returned home via Shanghai. It is said that there are many Egyptians in Shanghai, and it is appropriate to have a consul and commercial commissioner stationed in Shanghai to represent the Egyptian government and enhance diplomatic and commercial relations between China and Egypt. It is speculated in business circles that this trip may be related to the negotiations on selling Egyptian cotton to Japan, as Japan is considering purchasing Egyptian cotton to retaliate after the United Kingdom announced the cancellation of the Indo-Japanese Commercial Treaty and imposed heavy taxes on Japanese goods exported to India.</p>

The newest discipline is constructed with natural science and by the human. When life and work becomes automatic and inventive, China would not have to copy the West.Chuan Youren will speak three times and illustrate the method to make Chinese life and work automatic.

<h3 id="e3">Methods of Adjusting Regeneration <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Zhongtao</p>
<p>For a radio receiver with fewer than three vacuum tubes, adding a regeneration coil can significantly increase reception efficiency. Now, let's discuss how to adjust regeneration. There are four methods for adjusting regeneration:</p>
<p>1. Adjustable Regeneration Coil Method</p>
<p>2. Adjustable Capacitor Method</p>
<p>3. Resistance Adjustment</p>
<p>4. Filament Adjustment</p>
<p>Let me describe them in order.</p>
<p>Adjustable Regeneration Coil Method: This method employs an adjustable regeneration coil to regulate regeneration by varying the distance or orientation between the regeneration coil and the secondary coil, thereby controlling the magnitude of inductive force. Commonly sold drum-type three-circuit coils and spider-web coil frames fall into this category. With a drum-type coil, when the regeneration coil and secondary coil are parallel, induction is at its maximum, resulting in the strongest regeneration. When they are at right angles, induction is minimal, and regeneration is weakest. (If the situation is reversed, it's due to the regeneration coil being connected backward and should be reconnected.) As for the spider-web type, the magnitude of regeneration is determined by the distance between the coils. See circuit diagram Figure 1.</p>
<p>Adjustable Capacitor Method: The previous adjustment method is not very convenient. If the regeneration coil and secondary coil positions are fixed, an adjustable capacitor is added, with a capacitance of 0.00035 or 0.0005 microfarads (μF). (The value should be determined by the number of turns in the coil; more turns require a smaller capacitance, and fewer turns require a larger capacitance.) The wiring method involves connecting one end of the regeneration coil to the earphone post and also to the fixed plate of the capacitor; the adjustable plate of the capacitor is connected to the negative terminal of the B battery and grounded. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the circuit diagrams. The difference in the lower diagram is the addition of a high-frequency choke at the earphone connection to reduce noise.</p>
<p>Resistance Adjustment Method: The magnitude of regeneration is directly proportional to the plate current. Therefore, adding a 500,000-ohm adjustable resistor between the earphone and the positive terminal of the B battery can be used to adjust regeneration. Resistance and voltage are inversely proportional, and voltage and current are directly proportional. Thus, we can adjust the plate voltage by varying the resistance, and then adjust regeneration through the relationship between plate voltage and plate current. See circuit diagram Figure 4. In the diagram, the 1-microfarad fixed capacitor is used to prevent noise caused by unstable contact between the adjustable handle and the resistor part of the adjustable resistor.</p>
<p>Filament Adjustment Method: This method is based on the same principle as the previous method, but it uses the brightness of the filament to control the current strength, thereby adjusting regeneration. The filament rheostat used for regeneration adjustment should have a higher resistance than the usual type; it's best to use a carbon type, referred to in English as a CARBON PIT RHEOSTATE. See Figure 5.</p>
<p>Based on the author's experience, the second and third methods mentioned above are easier to adjust and most efficient. There are other methods, but they are omitted here for brevity.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Power Transformer Manufacturing Method (Continued) <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>The ratio of the output power to the input power at the primary input is called efficiency, often expressed as a percentage, as follows:</p>
<p>The efficiency of each transformer in the table is determined by actual experiments and is very practical.</p>
<p>Find a transformer with a 50-watt input in the table and multiply by the efficiency of that transformer, then the output number should be:</p>
<p>50 × 0.75 = 37.5 watts</p>
<p>If the output of the transformer in the example is 34 watts, which is less than the above number, it is safer to use a 50-watt transformer.</p>
<p>The primary input is 50 watts, connected to a 200-volt power line, so the current passing through the coil can be known, and the wire number can be determined. The formula for calculating the current is as follows:</p>
<p>The wire number to be used can be found in the second table. The primary uses 24 gauge wire (B. S.)</p>
<p>Secondary (1) uses 14 gauge wire (two strands in parallel)</p>
<p>(2) 15 or 14 gauge wire</p>
<p>(3) 34 gauge wire</p>
<p>Second table</p>
<p>The number of turns of the transformer can be obtained by multiplying the number of turns per volt by the number of volts.</p>
<p>Primary turns: 4.8 × 220 = 1056 turns (same as in the table)</p>
<p>Secondary turns (1): 4.8 × 2.5 = 12 turns</p>
<p>(2) 4.8 × 5 = 24 turns</p>
<p>(3) 4.8 × 600 = 2880 turns (draw out a tap in 1440 turns, i.e., the center line)</p>
<p>It is best to use silicon steel sheets shaped like the Chinese character "山" (mountain) for the iron core, but this kind of sheet is very expensive. The iron skin of gasoline cans can also be used, cut into the shape of "山" to replace it. The size of the iron core of the example transformer is shown in Figure 2. The iron cores of other transformers can be imitated accordingly.</p>
<p>After the iron core is cut, apply a thin layer of varnish or enamel on it to avoid eddy current loss. Then make a frame with thick paper as shown in the third figure. After it is made, you can wind the wire. First wind the secondary coil, then wind the high-voltage secondary coil, and wind the low-voltage secondary coil on the outermost layer. The wire must be wound very neatly, with wax paper separating each layer, especially several layers between the primary and secondary to prevent leakage. It is advisable to use enameled wire, because it can withstand higher voltage and takes up less space. After the wire is completely wound, immerse it completely in candle oil and fry it to prevent moisture. Then insert the iron cores opposite each other to form a perfect transformer! (The End)</p>

<p>According to a Reuter's dispatch, there are currently two major broadcasting companies in the United States, one is the National Broadcasting Company founded in 1926, and the other is the Columbia Broadcasting Company founded in 1927. In the near future, a third major broadcasting company may be established. The originator is Mr. Edwin, a comedian who is well-known in the American broadcasting industry. The required funds will be borne by local wealthy gentlemen. Several major companies have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the company as a means of broadcasting advertisements. When this new organization is established in the future, its broadcasting network will spread throughout the country, forming a tripartite with the two existing broadcasting networks, and competition will be inevitable.</p>

<p>— Cao Dongsheng</p>
<p>Now that we want to make our own radios, everyone likes to install AC-powered ones, which are economical, convenient, and clean. Battery-powered radios have almost become unattended. However, the most difficult thing in installing AC-powered radios is the resistance value of the B-battery replacement resistor. Now, a table is listed below for the reference of enthusiasts. (The resistance values in this table are for use on one vacuum tube. If two vacuum tubes share one, the resistance value can be halved.)</p>

<h3 id="e10">A Method to Avoid Interference: Shielding the Lead-In Wire <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— VT</p>
<p>The structure of the antenna has a significant relationship to eliminating radio station interference and various disturbances during radio reception. This is an undeniable fact. Interference can be roughly divided into three types: one is atmospheric interference, which people cannot avoid; the second is interference generated by the operation of electrical machinery; and the third is mutual interference of radio waves emitted by most radio stations. We can remedy and avoid this through the special structure of the antenna.</p>
<p>The remedy is to use a short vertical antenna, only ten feet long, installed at the highest point of the roof. The lead-in wire used is a shielded lead-in wire (SCREENED LEAD IN WIRE), which is to shield the lead-in wire and ground it). At the same time, special attention must be paid to the internal wiring of the radio, and the grounding must be particularly perfect. The radio itself must also be shielded. If necessary, a filter can also be used.</p>
<p>That the antenna is as short as ten feet is not a problem, since modern radio construction is becoming more and more perfect. However, in order to increase reception performance, the capacitance of the antenna should not be too small. The method of increasing its capacitance has always been to increase the number of antenna roots, but increasing the number of antenna roots will still increase interference. Therefore, we should use a spiral antenna to increase the length. In this way, the capacitance can be increased, and the interference from radio stations can be avoided as much as possible.</p>

<p>Domestic and Foreign News</p>
<p>Recent News from the China Radio Cooperative Society: The society was founded by amateur radio enthusiasts Wang Shuchuan and Pan Renrong in Suzhou, with the aim of consumer cooperation and joint research on radio. Since its establishment, it has been well-received by comrades from various places. It is reported that the society has established its first sales department in the Laifu Electrical Materials Store at the south end of Yuyuxiang, managed by Mr. Gao Cuizhi, and welcomes people from all walks of life to visit.</p>
<p>Philips Radio Receivers Are About to Arrive in Shanghai: Philips radio receivers are a well-known old brand radio receiver in Shanghai. This year's new machines will arrive in Shanghai in large quantities, with beautiful styles, sturdy machines, and particularly low prices. This year, a large-scale promotion will be carried out to popularize them, which is really good news for the radio market.</p>
<p>Key Points for Repairing Radio Receivers: The radio receiver repair department of the Yada Company, No. 25 Renji Road, Shanghai, recently repaired an "Akkton" radio receiver and a phonograph pickup, which had been unable to produce sound for a long time. A well-known repair company at sea had repaired it, and said that according to the circuit diagram of the machine body, there were no flaws to be found. Finally, it was repaired by the company, and Mr. Xu Zhifang, the chief engineer of the company, inspected it and determined that the phonograph was the problem. He immediately repaired it, and the original sound quality was restored in less than an hour. Mr. Wu, the owner of this Akkton radio, was overjoyed and published an article in the newspaper to praise it. It can be seen that the radio itself is just like the human body. Whether it can recover its health depends on whether the repairman has rich knowledge and sufficient experience, and uses ingenuity to solve it. It is no coincidence that Yada Company's radio receiver repair department can stand out from the crowd in the radio receiver repair industry in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Features of US Radio: US radio is produced by the US Radio and Television Factory in Marion Province, USA. Sales in the United States are amazing, all because of its remote and accurate reception. Now, the new goods of this machine are about to arrive in Shanghai, and it is the latest model in the second half of 1933. The bulbs inside are all the latest 57, 56, and 58 bulbs. The reception is very satisfactory even as far as Guizhou and Yunnan, and it is truly one of the best in radio receivers.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Doubts About Anti-British Slogans in Tokyo <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>The anti-British fervor in Tokyo is hotter than the "so hot that the dwarves jump" sung in the vegetarian meal variety shows! Just look at the black, white, and red characters printed on the anti-British slogans pasted on wooden boards, bamboo fences, and telephone poles throughout the city. A kind of stomping and resentment almost made them stomp their wooden clogs into pieces! Especially the slogans "Britain disregards Anglo-Japanese friendship and repays kindness with hatred." and "Gather the 400 million Chinese and 300 million Indians to drive out British forces to the west of the Suez Canal." The former is like a young woman resenting her lover, and the latter is like a shrew scolding in the street; but, I wonder if the British got this news, were they frightened or just laughed it off?</p>
<p>Laugh or jump? Let's not worry about that for now; but, looking at these two slogans with a calm eye, I can't help but have the following two doubts:</p>
<p>Do your citizens also know about friendship? Do they also know the boundaries of resentment and virtue? Let me ask, does the relationship between China and your country not qualify for the word "friend"? Your culture is completely derived from China. Spiritually and materially, you have received a lot of help from China. Does your country, when drinking water, think of its source, and has it forgotten China's great virtue? The Zhu Ming Dynasty, your country repeatedly harassed our maritime borders, not to mention that. In recent decades, we have not invaded your country, but your country has repeatedly launched military campaigns, ceded Ryukyu, destroyed Goryeo, demanded Taiwan, and swallowed Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jehol. Is this not repaying kindness with hatred?</p>
<p>Your country wants to drive the British to the west of the Suez Canal, I'm afraid that "drinking up the entire West River in one gulp" is not going to happen. Even if this happened, our 400 million people who have been ravaged by your country would actually be on the list of participants, which is a bit flattering. Since you are cooperating with the Chinese, why are you destroying the Chinese? If it is said that we are both in Asia and of the same yellow race, there is a possibility of cooperation; why, since the September 18th Incident, have we only seen your countrymen secretly flirting with the Europeans, and only wantonly used the most vicious artillery and aircraft to wreak havoc on the Chinese of the same continent and race? Posting slogans is your country's freedom; but, it is not too funny to write the 400 million Chinese on it as well?</p>
<h3 id="e12">The End of the Road <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Zui Chisheng</p>
<p>When a person reaches the point of "plans exhausted, assistance cut off, and nothing can be done," it is called "the end of the road." Therefore, "the end of the road" is the last stop of a person's life and career. From the literal meaning, it naturally contains full of sorrow and desolation.</p>
<p>The end of the road for a businessman is bankruptcy. The end of the road for the poor and those who are brokenhearted is suicide. The end of the road for criminals is imprisonment! Execution. The end of the road for the defeated is surrender; submission.</p>
<p>Only the end of the road for the rich and the military is unusual. Their end of the road is "going abroad." Once they are dismissed from their posts and out of office, forced by the environment, they walk to a foreign country. Whether it is for investigation or for recuperation, they always spend their years leisurely, and can somewhat absorb some fresh air from Europe. When they are happy and come back, the capital is originally Mack Mack, and they are still no less than a "rich man." Or they can still be called "an old man." Alas! The end of the road for the rich and the military is exactly the "end of the road" that ordinary people dream of and admire so much.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Ticks On the Market <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— A Jie</p>
<p>"Really annoying, Aunt Wang from next door is coming again! Eating a little doesn't matter, but once she starts talking, it's a headache to listen to!" This is what my grandmother often said at lunch and snack time. It turns out that Aunt Wang, my neighbor, is the reincarnation of Grandma Liu in the Dream of the Red Chamber. She has a mouth that can talk. Another characteristic is that when she sees smoke coming out of someone's chimney, or hears the sound of cooking in a pot, she will definitely come to my house. Of course, when she sees our elderly grandmother, she wants to start talking, talking about the east and the west, and not stopping. We have already brought up lunch or snacks at this time, of course, we can't let Aunt Wang sit alone in the corner. She is also not to be outdone, sits down with a thump, and eats a full stomach. While gobbling down food, she talked about the Classics of Mountains and Seas. First, she chanted "Amitabha," and then smeared her mouth and said, "The mother of the eldest, was caught in adultery last night: the daughter-in-law of the second eldest, stole a man and ran away." Piece by piece, she reported the scandals in society to my grandmother, like an outside reporter in a newspaper. After eating, Aunt Wang wiped her mouth, and the conversation stopped from then on. She will have to wait until tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, when the smoke comes out of our chimney and the sound of pots and pans sounds again, and she will come to our humble house again and start her mouth work.</p>
<p>These days, ticks are on the market, so I am reminded of Aunt Wang when I was a child. It's really strange, we spent half a day in the corner of the bed and on the top of the tent doing the work of suppressing bandits, hoping to wipe them all out, eliminate the red bandits, and live a peaceful life in peace and stability, and be peaceful people. How could we know that they appear and disappear unpredictably, decentralize and integrate, and it is really not easy to pacify them! Because we cannot sleep well at night, we cannot do things during the day; therefore, "resisting foreign aggression" must first "pacify the interior," which is a military strategy that is justified. For example, in a few days, poisonous mosquitoes will suck our blood. As long as we keep the tent tightly closed and have this Great Wall-like national defense, we will not be invaded by poisonous mosquitoes and can rest easy. Only the ticks in the cracks of the bed are the most difficult internal troubles to solve! Therefore, "resisting foreign aggression" must first "pacify the interior," and the work of catching ticks is more important than the work of exterminating poisonous mosquitoes; therefore, I put aside poisonous mosquitoes and only talk about ticks.</p>
<p>It is said that ticks have very sensitive hearing and sense of smell. We cannot hear the sound of our own blood flowing in our bodies, but in the ears of ticks, it is like the tide of the Yangtze River surging and surging. We don't smell our own armpit odor, bad breath, bullhead odor, etc., and we are proud that our whole body is fragrant and fragrant, and our breath is like orchid: but when it blows into the nose of a tick, it naturally understands, and of course it will cling to the smelly like ants on rotten meat. Ticks have this ability, just like fleas. To compare the jumping ability of fleas to humans, isn't it able to jump over the roof of Sassoon? These are all unique gifts given to insects by nature, there is no need to envy and admire them. Only our good neighbor Aunt Wang is like this!</p>

The child in his arms heard this, put his two little palms together, bowed, and made a New Year's greeting in his father's arms. The two older ones only hid behind their father. Zhao Ziqiang touched the child's head, said a few words with a smile, took out some money, bought two sugar figurines for each of the children, and then went into the house. Yin Deren smiled and said: Our Big Brother Guan is so busy in the camp, and when he comes home, he is incredibly busy. Guan Yaowu sighed and said: There's no way! Your sister-in-law is alone, except for my eldest son, she has to take care of these three children, and also do the laundry and cooking, which is really enough for her. When I come back, I feel a little bad. I always have to help her a little. As he spoke, he led the two of them into the house. They lived in the three northern houses in the middle. In the middle room, there was also a table for offering sacrifices to the gods, and the ground was covered with sesame stalks for stepping on the year. However, there were also children's toys, small gongs, small drums, small knives and spears, as well as pieces of wet poop that had fallen and not been picked up. The adults used a basin of leftover filling, and a white coal stove. On the tea table were hard seeds wrapped in miscellaneous things, and on the chairs were ivory dominoes, sesame candy, and a foreign iron kettle. Guan Yaowu stood in the middle of the room and shouted: Come on! Look, what a mess this room is in. Where is our eldest son? Let him come and sweep the floor. Someone in the room replied: It's not after the third day of the new year yet, how can you sweep the floor? Guan Yaowu said: There are so many children in our family, it's always enough to make a mess. The sesame stalks that have fallen on the ground are simply... Before he could finish speaking, the voice in the room was twice as loud and said: What do you know? It's because there are children in the family that we bought sesame stalks to step on the year. Is it for you, a person as big as you, to use? Zhao Ziqiang had just entered the door and caused a quarrel in someone else's family, which was a bit embarrassing, so he interrupted and said: Sister-in-law, please come out, we're here to wish you a happy New Year. The person inside the room was Guan Yaowu's wife, Yuan Shi. (61)</p>

<p>— Zhang Ruochun</p>
<p>Crystal Palace</p>
<p>Every day at dusk, I hang my cane and stroll along the sidewalk on Avenue Joffre, accustomed to the decorations of the shops on both sides. One evening, near Rue Cardinal Mercier, I unexpectedly discovered a novel window. Inside the tall, transparent glass window were displayed many shell-shaped soda bottles, alternating in red and white. The nickel-plated caps and accessories on the bottles reflected dazzling electric light, capturing the attention of passersby.</p>
<p>A right-angled white-lacquered counter was filled with glass bottles of all sizes. Through the gaps between the glittering containers holding mineral water, the beautiful figure of a young woman in white emerged. Everything was white-lacquered, silver, and glass, completely evoking the atmosphere of an open-air ice-drinking place by the summer seaside.</p>
<p>I and a friend who had just returned from Vienna, along with another friend wearing a new silver-gray flannel suit, chose seats near the road and sat down in the white-lacquered rattan chairs with streamlined designs. We looked around in amazement, realizing that there was neither coffee nor beer here. The sign told us that this was a place exclusively selling "Shada Mineral Water," so we ordered three glasses of mineral water from the unique waitress.</p>
<p>The blonde, blue-eyed waitress served three glasses of fruit-flavored mineral water of different colors. The one as red as a woman's cherry lips was plum juice; the orange-yellow one like kumquat was lemon. I chose a glass of soapy liquid, distinguishing the exquisite taste of chocolate on the tip of my tongue.</p>
<p>Whether it was psychological or scientific, we found that the taste of the mineral water was indeed somewhat different from ordinary soda water or filtered water. The texture of the mineral water seemed thick and cold. I had drunk Huiquan spring water from Wuxi and tasted spring tea from Hupao Temple in Hangzhou. Huiquan spring water and spring tea are brewed with spring water, so they felt clear, fragrant, and slightly bitter. This mineral water was mixed with fruit juice, so it only felt sweet and cool to the heart.</p>
<p>Above our heads were four stage-like electric lights, emitting strong white light. We were like film actors performing under crystal lights, gazing at the pedestrians on the street through the glass window, seeing only vague, dreamlike shadows. We quietly smoked cigarettes, surrounded by bright, shimmering glass windows and mirrors, as if we were in a crystal palace from a fairy tale or a beautiful legend.</p>
<p>The cigarette gradually burned down, and the mineral water in the glasses slowly receded like the tide. Our conversation began.</p>
<p>A: "Mr. So-and-so's elegant hobby is truly admirable. He recently published correspondence with a female student who calls herself Little Devil. Have you seen it?"</p>
<p>B: "No, it's just a nauseating attempt at humor. There's nothing to see."</p>
<p>C: "Those aren't ordinary love letters. That female student is the woman who bore Mr. So-and-so's child. You must see it."</p>
<p>B: "At most, it's just something to amuse the poor."</p>
<p>A: "Don't underestimate him. Mr. So-and-so has his own extraordinary greatness. His greatness is that he feels he is a good person when hated by the people he hates."</p>
<p>C: "In my opinion, Mr. So-and-so's only merit is that he always sees everything Chinese, every word and deed, in the worst possible light. What the Chinese say is good, he always thinks is bad. What the Chinese hate, he insists is good."</p>
<p>A: "This isn't his insensitivity. His liking to think in the worst way proves that he loves the Chinese. It's like, the more he loves, the more he hates."</p>
<p>B: "When Mr. So-and-so speaks, people find it laughable, but he himself doesn't laugh. Why is that?"</p>
<p>C: "Because the Chinese are laughable."</p>
<p>A: "When Bernard Shaw came to Shanghai, Shaw smiled. Didn't Mr. So-and-so also smile along? If you don't believe me, there are photos to prove it."</p>
<p>B: "If Mr. So-and-so truly liked Shaw for the reason of 'the more he loves, the more he hates,' he should have slapped Shaw in the face."</p>
<p>An hour passed in this way.</p>

Securities</p>
<p>Government Bonds Still in the Brewing Period</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was relatively tense, but it was still in a state of chaotic circling. The market sentiment was still divided, with different intentions. Large accounts were mostly empty and motionless, and retail investors were more agile in trading. The first-hand entry and exit were still relatively strong, because the 16th and 35th were slightly in demand, and the selling side was mostly fragmented. Therefore, the market price slightly increased by 2-3 jiao, among which the 19th Pass still slightly decreased by 1 jiao. In the second hand, there were many retail investors closing out long positions. Except for the 19th Post-War Rehabilitation, which was still slightly better by 5 fen or 1 jiao, the rest all fell back by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao. The trend of circling became more obvious. In the afternoon, the opening of the 20th and 21st was slightly bought in, and the unified tax increased by 3 jiao.

The rest were also slightly better by 5 fen to 1-2 jiao, but this month's salt tax fell by 5 fen again. It was confusing and complicated. The circling and brewing may still be delayed for several days. The arrival of changes seems to be still waiting. To sum up, the market price increased by 5 fen, 1 jiao, and up to 3-4 jiao, but the distant futures of troop reduction alone increased by 5 jiao the most. The total number of transactions was 5,793,000 yuan, including 3,000 yuan in cash. The salt tax futures accounted for the most, at 1,610,000 yuan. The unified tax and troop reduction each accounted for 1 million and change. The rest were only tens of thousands to 3-400,000.</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Strong</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that on Thursday (4th), the New York stock market rose because the public expected that automobile prices would increase, and the sales of chain stores in April improved. Automobile stocks rose first, and all stocks also rose strongly. The total number of transactions for the day was 4,590,000 shares. According to a telegram from New York trustee Haitengs East Company, the situation of American cotton is very good, because the manufacturer's purchase stomach is quite strong, the harvest report is not good, and the sales of coarse cloth are smooth, so even if there is inflation, it is appropriate to buy it. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left. Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>New Long Positions Appear in the Yarn and Cotton Market</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm and the situation is relatively stable. Because a part of the purchases are long, and the raw cotton rises very sharply, the yarn market is more firm and expensive, but the actual demand is still dull. The new long positions have not been very enthusiastic. The current market situation has the possibility of standing.</p>
<p>The Yarn Is Good for Half a Yuan This Month</p>
<p>The opening of the Ren Biao pre-market was flat, and each month rose by 2-3 jiao. Then, because the cotton market was strong, each month rose again. As a result, it rose by 4.5.7 jiao. The opening of the afternoon market was flat, and the second and third disks rose. Each month rose again by 1.2.3.4.5 jiao. The total number of transactions for the day was 23,100 bales. It was found that Yongchang sold 1,150 bales, Tongji 1,000 bales, Changfeng 1,050 bales, and Yuande 600 bales. Yongda bought 1,100 bales, Huachang 800 bales, and Mingde 700 bales.

<p>North Gang 5 Shantou 140 Fujian 12 Ningbo 3 Fellow Traders 130</p>
<p>The cotton market is very hard and the rising wind is quite sharp. Because new buyers are flocking in, the recent foreign cotton is stable, and the exchange rate is not long. The calculated silver disk is more expensive, and the prices in various production areas have risen slightly. Therefore, sellers are lacking, and general speculators tend to buy in. The market is rising, but the factories have no intention of heavy purchases because the yarn market is not good.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Advances Lightly and Quickly</p>
<p>The opening of the Zheng Biao pre-market, the market situation rose, the situation was sharp, more said that there is a need for cash cotton, so there are more buyers, each month rose from 1.5 jiao to 4.5 jiao, in the afternoon a large account purchased, the market atmosphere is still expensive, each month rose again 1.2 jiao, the total number of transactions throughout the day was 17,500 dan, It was found that Yuanda sold 5,100 dan, Tongfu 2,700 dan, Tongji 3,100 dan, Ruida 2,900 dan, Changfeng 2,100 dan, and Chunji 1,700 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the silk market had no great honor or disgrace. French merchants continued to make transactions, but the batches were not large. It is estimated that the white factories that have been transacted have Shuanghe (11.13) 10 dan, price 840 yuan, and B zi (16.22) 20 dan, price 710 yuan, and Tonghe (13.15) 10 dan, 710 yuan, and Wuhe (9.11) 10 dan, price 985 yuan. Chuanhuang that has been transacted has FK 10 dan, price 680 yuan, and Shuanglu 10 dan, price the same. According to the report of the silk inspection office, the export of raw silk last week was 630 dan, and even waste silk 178 dan, totaling 88 dan,</p>

<p>Continued Records of the Silkworm Season in Su and Zhejiang</p>
<p>Wujin</p>
<p>Wujin in Jiangsu Province is also the most prosperous area for silkworm rearing. There are more than 200 cocoon shops in the whole county. The cocoon production in each session is no less than that of Wuxi. In recent years, due to the damage caused by the weather, the silkworm affairs have repeatedly failed. This year, the price of rice is also cheap, and the spring season is winter, and the small harvest is disappointing. The rural economy is bankrupt, and there is no capital to purchase seeds. In addition, the late spring cold rain lasts for more than ten days, and the germination of mulberry plants is relatively late, so the spring silkworms in the four villages are unusually silent. Fortunately, the weather turned clear later, and the farmers who planted mulberry trees borrowed money and capital to purchase seeds and hatch them. The amount of feeding is smooth in the areas of Henglin Qishuyan in the east, and there are many who feed foreign species. There are interplanted earth species in the west villages. The temperature is suitable, and the ants are collected quite neatly. The early gangs in the west villages have been opening leaves for many days, and the late gangs in the east villages are still trying leaves,</p>
<p>Haining</p>
<p>The native species of early gangs in Haining, Zhejiang Province, have been discarded in 78/10 this year due to economic and weather reasons. Afterwards, the weather turned better, and the farmers borrowed silkworm capital to increase the purchase of improved species and engaged in hatching and collecting ants. After that, the climate was suitable, and the silkworm ants developed smoothly. The early gangs of improved species silkworms have been in good condition and have been leaf-eating for three sleeps, and the late gangs will also start sleeping. The temperature has been lower in the past two days, and there has been cloudy rain, but with the assistance of instructors, the silkworm households have been able to adjust the care. According to reports, some people in Jinshidun and other places are late to wake up from sleep. Although the tea merchants have been insisting, they have been weak, so they are all holding a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, the new teas from Wenzhou, Sui'an, and local villages have been listed one after another, and the new disks have not been opened. This kind of depressing situation has not been seen in recent years. Wuyuan Maofeng has been mined</p>
<p>The new tea in the four villages of Wuyi County, because the weather has been clear and warm in the past two days, the early tea in Zhouyuan has been drawn very quickly. Tea farmers in various villages in Yanchuan Jinzhu in the northern village are selling a lot of Maofeng, and a small number of them have opened gardens early to pick tender leaves from yesterday, hoping to produce excellent products and easily sell them at good prices. Jinzhu Lishengxiang Tea Farm has posted notices in nearby villages the day before yesterday, advising mountain households to pick them early, and also offers a price to collect blue, each catty of leaves is calculated to be worth 24 fen to 3 jiao. If it is sunny and does not rain in the morning, there will be a large number of new head buds of Maofeng,</p>

<p>Hekou Rice Sales Move, Price Rises Slightly</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's sources were more than 20 numbers, zero and wholesale two stomachs were lazy at the beginning of the market, and the situation was dull. In the afternoon, the guests and charterers on the street suddenly became crowded, and the sellers continued to become popular. The prices of Jiangsu Tong粳 and Nangang thick rice were increased slightly, and it was estimated that Weihaiwei Tianjin Yantai and other gangs took more than a thousand bales of Jiangsu Tong粳, Qingjiao gang Si Songxi Lian and other thin rice 2,000 bales, and the price of Qingjiao and other thin rice also increased slightly. Duyangjian is firm, Changgang粳 and Bianyuan are still stable, and the arrival and sales of Yin Yuan are equally divided, and the price is the same.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 245 ships from various roads under the river, and the walk of Bai粳 was clear and dull in the morning. In the afternoon, the shop stomach continued to transform, so the market was fixed. The thin rice was fixed, the early rice was slightly soft, and the 秈米 was still fixed. The 俼元 was flat, and the source of Baiyuan continued, and the zero transformation was still possible. The market situation was slightly tired,</p>
<p>Powder Market Dispersed, Recent Period More Unstable</p>
<p>Yesterday's powder market, after the opening of the market, the various months still showed the image of being near-virtual and far-flat, because the quotation of foreign wheat was still good for about two or three or four jiao, but the northern customers, because the war was becoming more and more urgent, the purchasing power was already weak, and the inquiries were even more silent. Therefore, the opening price for this month was unstable, falling by 5 li compared with the previous day. People's hearts were also unstable in June, and there were fewer transactions, and the market atmosphere was even more dispersed. The months after July were still flat. Until the afternoon opening, the situation</p>
<h3 id="e16">Hope and Luck <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Ying</p>
<p>In these times when economic panic is rampant throughout the world, even reducing one bowl of rice per meal, a necessity of life, is a good thing. As for luxury goods that do not fill the stomach, it is natural to economize on them, or to use those of poorer quality and lower price.</p>
<p>However, those commodities that used to sell well and were relatively expensive, aren't they "piled up like mountains" and rotting in warehouses because everyone is economizing? Selling at a loss regardless of the cost is not a game. After deep thought and deliberation, the capitalists say a beautiful thing: It's not difficult for us to shut down the factories and auction off the inventory, but the unemployment of the workers is a major social problem!</p>
<p>Therefore, they are taking advantage of the crowd's gambling mentality in a declining society, coming up with all sorts of "prize coupons" and "cash rewards."</p>
<p>Thus, even students and young ladies who used to smoke cigarettes are buying two packs of domestically produced White Gold Dragon cigarettes to participate in the poetry riddle contest, hoping to win the first prize, "500 yuan in cash."</p>
<p>Workers who have never used any kind of perfumed soap to wash their faces are also saving their meal money to buy a few bars of Palm Soap, cutting out the fragments of airplanes, towers, butterflies, roosters, rabbits, etc. from the newspaper and gluing them onto a white sheet of paper, hoping to win a radio. Or, instead of participating in a free three-day tour of Putuo and Suzhou, they can redeem it for dozens of yuan in cash.</p>
<p>It is said that the government-issued aviation lottery tickets have already gone on sale. Several people must pool their money to buy a ticket and dream a golden dream. If they have the money, shouldn't Italy, Switzerland, and France be open for everyone to travel, not just the "big shots"? Everyone should lie on their backs, face up, on their beds and hope!</p>
<p>Hope and luck are our Chinese spiritual civilization. Hoping that the Japanese soldiers will automatically withdraw from the Great Wall, withdraw from Rehe and the three northeastern provinces. Heaven has eyes and should sink the three islands of Japan! Japan is originally an island nation prone to earthquakes!</p>
<h3 id="e17">Feinting East and Attacking West <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Xu</p>
<p>In Chinese strategic terms, in contrast to "pacifying the interior and resisting foreign aggression," there is also a tactic called "feinting east and attacking west." The Japanese imperialist army's invasion is clearly in the Northeast, but the direction of the Chinese army is deliberately not towards that area. What is particularly unpredictable and baffling is the defense plan in the southwest. If the attack comes from the Northeast, I think no matter how large the cannons are, one shot now, one shot now, they still can't hit the southwest, but defensive fortifications are already being built on the southwestern border.</p>
<p>This kind of Chinese strategy of "feinting east and attacking west" is not only useful in actual combat, but also in general declarations. Please see the "Letter to Workers from the Municipal General Labor Union" on May 1st, which first says to unite and unite to overthrow the aggression of international capitalism and resist the unreasonable oppression of domestic capitalists; then it says that China's production is backward and that we must endure hardship and work hard to reduce production costs; finally, it particularly emphasizes sharing the difficulties and striving for sincere cooperation between labor and capital (see the Shanghai News section of the May 1st Shen Bao).</p>
<p>Foreigners also use this tactic in political warfare, commercial warfare, or other battlefields, but they use it more skillfully than the Chinese, making it difficult to see the underlying reasons at a glance. For example, Japan clearly has ambitions to annex Chahar and Suiyuan, and occupy Beiping and Tianjin, and is actively plotting in secret, but Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi's words to reporters say that the attitude Japan is currently taking is one of quiet observation, generally meaning that Japan is neither fighting nor negotiating with China. Austria's repair of tens of thousands of guns for Italy seems to be just a commercial transaction on the surface, but in reality, it has long been seen through by Britain and France, who have lodged a protest, saying that in order to maintain peace in Europe and implement disarmament among nations, they have to take this tough stance.</p>
<p>The strategy of "feinting east and attacking west" is used both in China and abroad, but it seems that the Chinese only use it internally, while foreigners use it exclusively externally, with only this one difference.</p>

<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>As I wandered and thought on the street, my footsteps unconsciously reversed, and after a few turns, I actually moved my own body to a road near the university. Looking ahead, there was another pile of earthen hills. Below the hills were flat dirt roads and shallow ponds. I had come to this area when I was a child. More than twenty years ago, I had a relative who had served as an officer in Baoguo Temple, and I had an older brother who had been a student in the Army Elementary School. Since I had already returned to the vicinity of my residence, I might as well climb up the hill and take a look. After not sleeping all night, my mind was still a bit muddled, and ascending to a height to look around might not be a bad way to clear my head.</p>
<p>The weather was also gradually clearing up, and in the southeastern half, a few patches of blue sky and a trace of sunlight had actually appeared. Although the earthen hills were not high, the view was not bad. The mountains on the lake surrounded the northwest area, and further north was empty space, and even further north were the hair-like green mountains in Huzhou. Far to the east, the visible peaks were Lianping Mountain, Gaoting Mountain, Huanghe Mountain, and the like. A little more to the northeast, it was probably the shadow of Chao Mountain in Tangqi. Although it didn't seem far away, it would probably take half a day to walk there. After looking around on the earthen hills, from far to near, I finally understood the geography of this area by calculating with a mass observation method. It turned out that my new residence was to the north of the Ordnance Bureau, and the earthen hills on three sides were remotely connected to the city walls, surrounding the Ordnance Bureau. No wonder I heard a burst of bugle calls at dawn today, and no wonder I saw a guard soldier standing upright with a gun when I walked out of the new residence.</p>
<p>"Very good! Very good!..." I thought in my heart, "With books in front and an armory in the back, the way of the civilian and the military is complete here!" Although I was amusing myself in this way in my heart, a feeling of decline, a sorrow of not being able to gain a foothold in the metropolis again, gradually permeated my whole body. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e19">May <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Muzhai</p>
<p>May has arrived, and the time has come for Japan and China to settle accounts.</p>
<p>In the lunar calendar, this month is said to be a poisonous month, and the fifth day of the month is the most poisonous day of the poisonous month, designated as the Dragon Boat Festival, with paper charms, mugwort swords, Zhong Kui images hanging, and realgar wine drunk, all said to be used to ward off evil and eliminate disasters.</p>
<p>In the current calendar, there are "May 3rd," "May 4th," "May 5th" (note), "May 7th," "May 9th," "May 30th," and other memorial days that are fragments of memorial days, pieced together into a confused account of May. On each memorial day, memorial meetings are held as usual, with Sun Yat-sen's portrait hung, slogans posted, and calls shouted, and sometimes a day off is also taken. The creditors of these many memorial days are all, or partially, related to Japan, and the routine work of each memorial day is probably to overthrow "Eastern devils" or "dwarf devils."</p>
<p>Using old Chinese sayings to express the difference between the two: the object of the Dragon Boat Festival can be said to be "natural disasters," and the purpose can be said to be "protecting the home"; the object of various memorial days is "man-made disasters," and the purpose is "saving the nation."</p>
<p>"Natural disasters" are long-term, and "long-term resistance" requires sustained strength, so first of all, we must "prepare for resistance"丨丨no, "preparing for resistance" is "long-term resistance," stimulating and storing strength. In this way, the poisonous month becomes a festive season. The stimulating realgar wine and the condensing glutinous rice dumplings have different functions here, but they complement each other. Although they don't know "protecting the home without forgetting entertainment," they can also say things like "harmony brings auspiciousness." From this point of view, long-term resistance is not an invention of modern people, but a traditional Chinese art.</p>
<p>Ancient substance, modern style, modern people should of course be more skillful. Taking a holiday on memorial days can be said to be "studying without forgetting saving the nation." This is the first movement. The original meaning of memorial days is to inject new life into dead bones, but now they want to get some stimulation from dead bones. Saving the nation must first save oneself, saving oneself must first save the heart, so we wander and roam, "entertaining to save the nation." This is the second movement. Excessive stimulation leads to麻醉. The initial appearance of stimulation is tension, is urging, although tension is momentary, the one being urged has had enough: things have roots and branches, returning to the true and the simple, naturally must be restored: "saving the nation without forgetting reading." This is the third movement. Excessive tension results in "calm."</p>
<p>The lunar May is nominally abolished; what about the confused account of the current May?</p>

<h3 id="e20">Little Lotus <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Wanrong</p>
<p>Although the peach blossoms have fallen, fortunately the bauhinia flowers are in full bloom, and soon the fragrant lilacs will replace the showy bauhinia. Walking out of the northern city, the road is crowded with men and women enjoying the spring. The waterfall of Peach Blossom Stream rushes forward incessantly, and several children in red clothes are laughing at the splashing water. The moving laughter follows the flowing water far away. In the azure sky, white clouds float, and the cuckoo's cry tells us that spring is deep.</p>
<p>Climbing over the large stone engraved with the three red characters "Peach Blossom Stream," and then turning past a very tall chaste chastity arch, a desolate tomb appears in the clusters of pines, cypresses, and chestnut trees. Although today is Qingming Festival, there is no paper ash or fresh flowers to be found in front of the tomb, and even less anyone weeping or sighing there. Only a pair of cuckoos are singing sadly on the branches. The clear sound of the flowing water of Peach Blossom Stream transmits to this quiet realm.</p>
<p>Walking to the front of the tomb, behind the tomb is a stone tablet, the writing on the tablet is already blurred, but after careful identification, one can still see the five characters: "Tomb of Little Lotus." "Little Lotus, who is she?" I wondered. At the same time, the shadow of a sallow little girl flickered before my eyes.</p>
<p>Little Lotus was a child who sold her skills, she followed her parents and companions,摇着boat around various places, and always came to my hometown several times a year. The boat happened to stop at a dock outside the window of the study, and I often heard her companions calling her that, so I knew that "Little Lotus" was her beautiful name.</p>
<p>As long as that dilapidated white wooden boat docked outside the window, I would start to get busy. Not to mention going to school, I even lacked the mood to eat, and all day I would lie on the window throwing some fruit onto their boat, teasing that monkey in the red clothes. As usual, around ten o'clock in the morning, they would have lunch, and after that they would tidy everything up. Little Lotus's father, that middle-aged man, and two young men, carried the boxes and other necessary items, Little Lotus's mother squatted with the monkey in the red clothes, Little Lotus changed into a red jacket and green pants, behind her mother, everyone set off to perform in the open space in front of the Pillow Stone Pavilion teahouse.</p>
<p>Little Lotus's skills were not small, she could stand on the wine bottle that her mother was wobblyly squatting on, she could sing, and she could also do the trick of taking off and putting on clothes on a bamboo pole hanging in mid-air with her pigtails. But that child always had a sallow face, and her body was as tired as a dried chicken. Last year when she came to my hometown she was this sallow and thin, this short, and this year she is still this sallow and thin, this short. It looks like she will always be eleven or twelve years old.</p>
<p>Two years ago, on a New Year's Day, Little Lotus and her parents and companions were brought under my window by that dilapidated white wooden boat again. I lay on the window all day again teasing that monkey in the red clothes. Little Lotus was not only still that sallow and thin, that short, but she was also often seen holding her chest, frowning, and coughing. But she still went ashore to sell her skills every day around ten o'clock in the morning, and returned to the boat around five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>On this day, at about two o'clock, my brothers and I were playing dice, when suddenly there was a commotion in the quiet pier for a while, and then there was the sound of women crying. I put down the dice, walked into the study, opened the window and looked towards the pier, many onlookers on the pier were discussing. After a while, my younger brother jumped in from outside and said: Little Lotus today stood on the wine bottle that her mother squatted on and sang, but she slipped and fell from a very high place, spat out a few mouthfuls of blood, and died.</p>
<p>In the evening, the sound of nailing coffins and Little Lotus's mother's wailing came from the pier again. The next morning, there was no movement. I pushed open the door and looked out, and the two dilapidated white wooden boats had quietly left the pier at some time.</p>
<p>Year after year, the dilapidated white wooden boat never came again, and the impression of Little Lotus, who was short and thin, holding her chest, frowning, and coughing, disappeared from my mind; who knew that today I would accidentally discover the grave of this pitiful girl on a walk in the spring outing?</p>
<p>Although they are strangers with whom I have no connection, but when I think of that young age, struggling with life, and sleeping in the yellow earth before tasting any sweetness of life, I always have a feeling of "difficult to ask heaven" of melancholy.</p>
<p>I solemnly inserted the bauhinia flowers I picked on the road in front of the tomb: Poor Little Lotus, rest in peace!</p>

<p>— by JULES RENARD, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Dots and Surfaces</p>
<p>When Lepic was in a good mood, he was very willing to make his children happy himself. When he was walking in the garden, he would tell them stories, sometimes making the eldest son Felix and Carrot Top laugh and roll on the ground. This morning, they were laughing to death again. But the elder sister, Ernestine, ran to tell them that the meal had been served, and they suddenly became quiet. Whenever the family sat together, everyone's faces were always frowning.</p>
<p>Everyone ate quickly and silently as usual, and after a while, everyone except one of the Lepic family had finished eating, at which time the one of the Lepic family said:</p>
<p>"Please give me a little bread to finish spreading my jam!"</p>
<p>Who was she talking to?</p>
<p>Most of the time, the one of the Lepic family always ate alone, so she only talked to the dog. She told it the price of the side dishes, she told it about the difficulty of supporting six people and a dog with a little money at this time.</p>
<p>"No," she said to Pilam, the dog (dog's name), wagging its tail on the grass mat and gurgling affectionately to her, "you really don't know the suffering I endure to support this family. You also think, like those men, that a cook can buy anything with a little money. Of course, you don't care at all if butter goes up in price or eggs are terribly expensive."</p>
<p>However, this time, the one of the Lepic family's attitude was unusual. She addressed her remark directly to Lepic as an exception. This time she was asking him, and indeed asking him, for a little bread to finish spreading her jam. There was no room for doubt about this. First, because she was looking at Lepic when she spoke. Secondly, because the bread was placed in front of Lepic. Lepic was startled at first, he hesitated for a moment, then, with his fingertips, he picked up a little bread from his dirty, eaten dish and threw it to the one of the Lepic family with a very serious and very gloomy face. threw it to the one of the Lepic family.</p>
<p>Was this a comedy, or a tragedy? Who knew?</p>
<p>The elder sister Ernestine felt her mother was humiliated, and felt a vague fear in her heart.</p>
<p>"Dad is very happy to joke around today," the eldest son Felix thought to himself, riding on the back of his chair as if no one was there.</p>
<p>As for Carrot Top, his mouth was full of grease, he kept his mouth tightly closed, his ears were filled with sounds, and his cheeks were swollen with fried sweet potatoes. He was holding back; but if the one of the Lepic family didn't leave the table immediately, he would explode. Because people were treating her like something cheap in front of her son and daughter!</p>
<p>(Correction) In yesterday's Carrot Top, the 36th line "First, I thought I was forbidding him to drink..." was a misprint of "He first thought I was forbidding him to drink...", hereby corrected.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Explanation of "Side Income" <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Zhi</p>
<p>Living in a realistic society, "side income" has indeed become the lifeline of most people. Yesterday I ran into an old classmate and talked about the problem of life. He told me that he worked in a certain company, with a salary of only twenty dollars a month, but he had the burden of a large family of eight, including servants, and he was able to live a very wealthy and comfortable life. I asked him how he coped, and he said: It all depends on "side income".</p>
<p>The so-called "side income" is the unexpected benefit outside of one's duty. In other words: it is a fluke, a harvest that should not be there and relies on fate: it is a cheap thing with only rights and absolutely no responsibilities. For example: my old classmate, he only gets a salary of twenty dollars a month, so he should only do things within the scope of twenty dollars, and he is not responsible for things outside of twenty dollars. Although his wealthy and comfortable life is ultimately a benefit of the company, because it is "side income," he does not have the obligation to fully bear responsibility. Another example: a corrupt official who desperately scrapes fat from the heads of the people, and he can certainly not have any political achievements. This is because what he scraped is not his due salary, but indeed "side income."</p>
<p>Now let's give a few practical examples to clarify what is called "side income."</p>
<p>On the evening of Shenyang's fall, several thousand "gold bars" from our young Marshal Zhang's family were confiscated by the Japanese. But later, it was said that as soon as Jinzhou was given away, the "gold bars" were returned to their original owner. The young marshal gave away a piece of Jinzhou and regained his "gold bars." This lost and regained "gold bars" is called "side income"; (2) Our young marshal (sorry, I still have to borrow our young marshal here), he lost the Northeast, thus losing his deputy commander-in-chief, pacification director, and acting deputy commissioner, etc. These kinds of official positions, which is certainly a very sad thing. But the young marshal was able to take this opportunity to run to Europe to play foreign golf, inject foreign morphine, hug foreign dancers, ... and bring some priceless antique national treasures with him when he left, auctioning off a naval hospital, of course, these are not insignificant supplements for our young marshal, and these are exactly the "side income" of the young marshal losing his official position; (3) General Tang escaped from Chengde, and many people advocated dragging him out to kill him, but he was finally very fortunate not to die, and now he is also serving as the commander and a certain county magistrate. This "happiness" is of course General Tang's "side income"; (4) The government draws taxes from the people because it wants to do things for the people. Sichuan Province's taxes have been collected until the 60th year of the Republic of China. In the year 22 of the Republic of China, the government certainly cannot and has no way to do things for the people in the era of the 60th year of the Republic of China, so it simply says: This over-collected tax is the "side income" of the Sichuan Provincial Government. Other examples include the intellectuals of Beiping and Tianjin "knowing" that North China is very dangerous, advocating that cultural relics should be transported south, schools should be moved south, and lives should be escaped to the south... This clever "knowing" is the "side income" in terms of knowledge. As for the gentlemen who usually do extremely bad things, they eat vegetarian food, chant scriptures, and set up Taoist altars,</p>
<p>Hoping that there will be no bad retribution in the future, this is even more trying to "find side income"!</p>
<p>However, some "side income" is extremely unfortunate! For example: the 30 million compatriots in the Northeast are clearly and truly Chinese, but now they are unexpectedly forced to be "Manchurians" under the Japanese iron hoofs: the people of Sichuan pay taxes until the 60th year of the Republic of China, but they have to escape two or three times a year to escape military disasters, and even be wronged ghosts under artillery fire two or three times. This unfortunate and undue harvest is an extremely painful "side income"!</p>
<p>Alas! Chinese people, whether happy or unhappy, are competing to live on "side income," or desperately trying to "find side income," which is why China is what it is today!</p>
<h3 id="e23">The Secrets of Hotels <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xian</p>
<p>Hotels are the so-called business platforms of the past, which are used to facilitate travelers, and there seems to be no secret between them: But our so-called Oriental Paris hotels are the opposite: large hotels with five or six floors are increasing year by year, the decoration strives to be beautiful, and the style strives to be modern, so the travelers are not authentic goods, but become playing with women: the secrets of hotels also arise from this.</p>
<p>Yesterday, because I was sending a friend to Chongqing, I, the country bumpkin, also stepped into the hotel for flirting with women. A room as big as my small building sells for seven silver dollars a day. Who says China is poor? It's really like sitting in a well and looking at the sky. Aren't Shanghai's hotels hanging up signs every day that they are full?</p>
<p>In a moment, a burst of high-heeled leather shoes came from the corridor, and at the same time a colorful piece of paper flew in from the door crack. After all, I, the country bumpkin, is still a country bumpkin, so I quickly grabbed it to look at it. It turned out to be an advertisement for a female fortune teller, which said:</p>
<p>XX has learned a lot in the way of physiognomy. All circles resisting to death vow</p>
<p>Neither dead nor alive</p>

<h3 id="e24">Secrets to Getting Ahead in the World <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Wei</p>
<p>Flatter whenever there's an opportunity</p>
<p>Brag loudly when the time is right</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>They reside at Room XXX, XX Hotel, Racecourse. Furthermore, a portrait of beautiful, alluring eyes is printed right in the center, as if telling people to recognize the trademark to avoid mistakes.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but recall the aftermath of the Yang Wenying murder case reported yesterday, wasn't it related to this "cherishing personality and reputation" X X? I shall refrain from elaborating due to the vulgar language involved. Perhaps readers haven't forgotten the Chen Xinzhai animalistic affair from last year, as a similar incident is present in this murder case as well.</p>
<p>I won't delve into whether the facts are true, but at the very least, I have many doubts regarding this colored advertisement:</p>
<p>(1) Every day, I flip through newspapers and walk the streets, yet I never see this kind of fortune-telling advertisement, but instead, it's distributed to various hotels by young women.</p>
<p>(2) Is printing one's own portrait akin to asking fortune-tellers to evaluate the quality of a product? Although I've seen the portrait of True Leftist in newspapers because he uses his left-handed calligraphy as a selling point, are their eyes, seeming to hold back tears, also a skill for fortune-telling?</p>
<p>(3) The phrases "Apart from fortune-telling, all social engagements are declined" and "Respectfully refuse inappropriate gifts" have set a new record for advertisements. I've never seen someone building a house ask a doctor to tell fortunes, and fortune-telling is fortune-telling, so why specifically state "Decline all social engagements"? As for "Respectfully refuse inappropriate gifts," I don't know what prompted such a statement.</p>
<p>(4) Their main base is located in XX Hotel. I cannot assert that using a hotel as a fortune-telling place is immoral, but hotels in Shanghai are generally recognized as secret locations. How can a fortune-teller who charges only two yuan for a reading afford to operate in a high-end hotel frequented by young masters seeking pleasure and fortune? How do they "make a living to save themselves"?</p>
<p>Later, advertisements for XXX Massage Parlor continued to fly in through the door crack. Shanghai is, after all, Shanghai; it constantly produces new and exciting things. I hope that in the near future, perhaps tomorrow, all buildings in Shanghai will be converted into hotels. When the Japanese invade the Yangtze River region, let them experience the variety of Shanghai's mirror tricks. I guarantee they'll find so much pleasure here that they'll forget about home and stop their northward advance to instead attack southern Guangdong.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Gan</p>
<p>Since the Japanese troops invaded Rehe, bombed the Great Wall, and shocked Tianjin and Beijing, people and experts have unanimously said that the military strength is too disparate and the nation cannot resist. In reality, while the Japanese troops' weapons are indeed formidable, deep down everyone had long arranged for the enemy's smooth advance, coupled with a few staged retreats, a tacit understanding between the two sides.</p>
<p>Things can indeed be insured. Currently, it seems that besides opium-addicted generals, there are not many who openly emulate Li Hongzhang, although many still secretly harbor such intentions. They wouldn't go so far as to stick out their tongues and shout, "Master, please come in." However, China has a wealth of talent, and the writers and scholars who don't want the talents of Jiang and Han to take all the glory feel the love (sic?) for their country and dare not lag behind. Although they dare not openly poison wells and kill four hundred million compatriots, they can certainly hide behind and stab a few times, echoing the Japanese troops. The only worry is that the hearts of the Chinese people are not dead, which would be terrible.</p>
<p>Recently, in the old lands of Yan and Zhao, a famous cultural city, there is a strange phenomenon. This person is neither a god nor a spirit, but a demon-like figure, born from the descendants of the Jin and Yuan dynasties, pretending to be Chinese, wielding his eloquent pen to write an obituary for the national crisis. He first advocated knocking on the doors of the League of Nations to seek joint governance, but the detestable Japanese devils were too ignorant and insisted on sole occupation. So he hatched a plan, transformed himself, put on Han Chinese attire, and looked like a Japanese doctor. Then, he turned his brush around and shouted: "We have been forced onto Mount Liang" (note, not the doctor going to Mount Liang). Reading further, it seems he's at least going to put on a bloody war of resistance. No, readers, rest assured, the doctor will never take you to the front lines. On the contrary, thinking from the "conscience" of the Japanese, truly "we cannot go against our conscience and advocate a declaration of war against Japan." And in order to "be fair to the United States and the League of Nations," the fundamental strategy is naturally to "persist in moral non-recognition." The implied opposite is that there's no need to fight back, just endure a few more blows. If the Japanese troops stubbornly refuse to stop, then we can only sacrifice with pain, because "we can wait fifty years." Of course, there's no need to say any more, the grand plan to save the nation and the wonderful writing techniques are all in this.</p>
<p>Enough, enough! The doctor is working so hard, even if he's not entirely genuine, at least his heart and soul have been Japanized. If my words are not wrong, when the empire's great undertaking is completed, the common people who resist Japan will not be spared. But the doctor can guarantee high official positions and generous rewards. If the doctor lives to a ripe old age, and fifty years later, China's national destiny flourishes, then he can return wearing wooden clogs and watch the peace, which would be truly delightful. If, unfortunately, this person passes away early, the Chinese people, in remembrance, might have the blessing of a crystal coffin to enjoy.</p>
<p>However, what the doctor did not expect is that imperialist oppression and enslavement have already laid the groundwork for the Chinese national revolutionary war, and Japan is igniting a fire on the fuse. At this time, a great power will erupt, and perhaps the "fifty years" of hope will be greatly discounted.</p>
<p>So, what will the doctor do? Only another transformation… right?</p>

<p>— Bing</p>
<p>X Month X Day</p>
<p>Woke up at eleven o'clock. Before washing up, the secretary reported on current affairs, noting subtle changes in the political situation. Immediately telephoned the editor-in-chief of the X newspaper, informed them of the confidential matters, instructed them to relay the information to all comrades, and scheduled a meeting at the X Hotel at 3 PM.</p>
<p>Ate raw milk and a tonic containing three eggs, a small amount. Went out to visit Comrade X to discuss strategies for dealing with the political coup. He advocated acting alone, but I believed that under certain circumstances, we should closely coordinate with various opposition factions. The ancients taught that "many hands make light work," and besides, the X faction has deep roots and cannot be overthrown by one faction alone. He smiled and nodded in agreement. Afterwards, we briefly discussed trivial matters related to women. He praised the X dance hall star Xiao Qiu, saying that she was willing to do as I wished; however, I still needed to give it some thought.</p>
<p>Left and went to X Restaurant for lunch, spending eight silver dollars. It was already four o'clock when I rushed to the X Hotel. The comrades had already arrived. At the meeting, three important resolutions were passed: first, to contact various opposition factions; second, to issue a declaration regarding the coup; and third, to intensify propaganda against X.</p>
<p>Returned to my residence and found eight name cards on the table. Except for the special representative of the X faction X, the rest were all comrades. Went out in the evening with Comrades X, X, and X.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Active in various places. Etc. Rejected.</p>
<p>Left the dance hall. Curfew in effect. Checked into the hotel to prevent accidents. Telephoned the residence secretary with confidential instructions.</p>
<p>X Month X Day</p>
<p>Around ten o'clock, Minister X and Commissioner X came, eagerly urging me to take the position of X. I had originally declined because I thought the area was undeveloped, but my subordinates were extremely eager, frequently inquiring. Now that the situation is inflexible, I will temporarily comply.</p>
<p>After breakfast, a group of reporters arrived. I made a statement, saying, "Urged by various parties, I have decided to take the position of X today. I will hold the swearing-in ceremony later."</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I went to the X Bureau with the secretary and seven others. After resting briefly, the secretary distributed the press release to the reporters, revealing the new list of department members. The old staff jointly submitted their resignations, which were approved. X was a lifelong friend and was newly appointed. The others received the endorsement: "Will be introduced to a new position."</p>
<p>I inspected the bureau once, opened the bureau treasury, and found three thousand silver dollars, which I took back with me.</p>
<p>Returned to my residence, where the courtyard was like a marketplace, filled with old acquaintances, whom I told, "Will be appointed later," and they dispersed.</p>
<p>In the evening, I telegraphed my relatives, asking them again about the types of positions they would like to take. The position of Director of Finance was the most sought after.</p>
<p>Went to the X Dance Hall with the dance star and went to X Company for shopping, spending one thousand six hundred silver dollars. The dance star sent the items back by car, while I went to the X Hotel. After waiting for a long time for the dance star to arrive, I couldn't restrain myself and called a girl to relieve my boredom. Before I even undressed, dawn had broken. I fell asleep with her in a daze. Suddenly, I remembered that I had banquets at three locations, including X, and that X and others had meetings. I got out of bed and called the residence secretary to quickly relay the message that all engagements were canceled.</p>
<p>X Month X Day</p>
<p>In the morning, Minister X came and prepared to refute the various rumors. X still hopes I will stay, urging me not to lose heart. However, I had already drafted my telegram of resignation and was determined. I went inside and told the secretary to send the telegram as planned.</p>
<p>After a small tonic and breakfast, I took my family by car to the train station and boarded the express train, arriving in X Port at 3 PM. A large number of telegrams had been sent to the residence, all urging me not to lose heart, because they suspected that I had already come to X Port, so they telegraphed directly here.</p>
<p>Having just unpacked, I was extremely tired. A group of reporters arrived at my heels, and I made a statement, saying, "I am suffering from a relapse of an old illness and cannot bear the burden of the X position, so I have repeatedly insisted on resigning and have come to the port to rest and recuperate. Now my wish has been granted. As for the plan to resist foreign aggression and save the country, we should act with sincerity, eliminate selfish views, and work together to overcome the national crisis."</p>
<p>Around four o'clock, to avoid the noise, I moved to the X Hospital and refused to see visitors, instructing them to properly resolve the situation.</p>
<p>In the evening, I and Xiao Qiu went to the X Hospital… and suddenly felt cheerful.</p>
<p>After leaving the theater, I went to X Company to buy decorations and returned to the hospital fully loaded. Foreign aid goods cost three hundred silver dollars, and I consumed them immediately upon arrival at the hospital.</p>
<p>One after another, I summoned the secretary and eight staff members, instructing them on the countermeasures.</p>
<p>My wife stayed in the hospital, and we talked in detail until dawn.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Abolish Prostitution Prohibition <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Youngster</p>
<p>It is said that the degree of development of urban civilization is measured by the number of brothels, the prosperity of gambling dens, and the drama of kidnapping cases and behind-the-scenes dealings. Moreover, they are directly proportional. Shanghai has become the greatest metropolis in our country precisely because it fits this formula. In other words (friends, please don't scold me for being arbitrary, blindly following, or absurdly inappropriate): if you want a place to become a lively and civilized city, there is only one way, absolutely only this one way, to equip it with the basic conditions that a city should have and make them complete, widespread, and universal. Then, it will naturally not let Shanghai have all the glory, and may even surpass Shanghai, you never know!</p>
<p>Nanjing is our expensive and large capital of the Republic of China, the Central Party Headquarters is located there, the Central Government is located there, the Central University is also located there, and foreigners, foreign envoys, and foreign goods enter and flood the city, so it has been listed as one of the six major cities in the country. However, although Nanjing is called a city, it has always lacked the basic conditions that a metropolis should have. (Someone said definitively that Nanjing is not as lively as Shanghai because of this major reason.) Just talking about brothels, they suffer from the "prohibition" order and cannot grow freely, which hurts the fact that adults and gentlemen have nowhere to vent their sexual desires, and they desperately run to Shanghai. Delaying some unimportant official business is not a big deal, but traveling back and forth in the wind and dust may harm their health, so this is not a long-term solution! This Youngster is deeply worried about this!</p>
<p>Good news! The bill to abolish prostitution prohibition has actually passed! This Youngster reverently read the special telegram three and a half times, washed his hands and put them together, and sincerely shouted from the depths of his soul, "The savior has come, Amitabha! Well done, well done, this is the blessing of my Buddha Bodhisattva manifesting!" From now on, the "beings of Nanjing" will be saved! However, strangely! Why did the female representatives not understand the greater good and cry bitterly in resistance? Are the female representatives' tears so easily shed and worthless? Only heaven knows!</p>

<p>"Good heavens, even a little bit of feces can be so charming. When she grows up… hahaha!"</p>
<p>Then she skillfully glared at him, patted his face, and continued playing with his brass button, seemingly shy, but still looking amorous.</p>
<p>"Little darling, would you like to be my goddaughter?" The old man said again, "Anyway, you don't have any biological parents, how pitiful."</p>
<p>"As long as Daddy is willing to love me, what's wrong with that?"</p>
<p>"Good girl, call me Daddy right away."</p>
<p>Another middle-aged man without a beard laughed loudly, which made the godfather even happier. Unexpectedly, the older sister who was leaning against the young man's chest drew on her cheek, pouted her lips, and put on a disdainful face, saying:</p>
<p>"Shameless bitch, no shame."</p>
<p>From then on, she really became that man's goddaughter, and no one really knew for sure, not even Wu Gui could say for certain. However, this old man often gave her money or bought her clothes to take care of her, which was true. In fact, there was more than one such person. Almost all the older clients were willing to recognize her as an adopted daughter, so she had many godfathers. However, she didn't know who her real father was, and even we had no way of knowing. However, according to Wu Gui's judgment: it was undoubtedly a purchase. As for whether her original surname was Yang, it was of course also questionable.</p>
<p>A fragment of her life</p>
<p>Two or three years passed, and Miss Liu grew even more beautiful.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, because of her intelligence and cleverness, she was able to gain people's affection. Therefore, some "masters with plenty of money" were willing to pay for her to go to girls' school. Although the Four Books for Women and Biographies of Virtuous Women could not transform her into a perfect lady of the house, she was able to memorize a few characters, which was true. In addition, she was so smart that her grades were comparable to a "top student in the newspaper." This alone proved that she was destined to rise above others.</p>
<p>However, studying was still studying, but the main business was still the main business. It goes without saying that sitting on strange men and lighting their cigarettes was necessary, and playing the pipa and singing opera were also indispensable parts of her daily life. She learned many Kunqu operas, and she also played the sanxian very well. No teacher who taught her singing didn't praise her for being capable. Later, Peking opera gradually became popular in the brothel, so she had to learn "Qin Qiong Selling His Horse" or "Su San Being Escorted," as well as master the "Xipi" and "Erhuang" styles.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that being human is not easy, and even being a prostitute is so difficult.</p>

<h3 id="e29">A Singer's Luck in Hollywood <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Qin</p>
<p>Bing Crosby pioneered the trend</p>
<p>Major stars have to practice singing</p>
<p>From the beginning when silent films were abandoned and sound films became popular, the film industry realized the importance of music and the necessity of singing in sound films. But at first, there wasn't the current intense need for RADIO STAR singers. Recently, we will never forget Bing Crosby, who as a singer was the first to occupy a position in the film world, with everyone admiring his singing voice. After Bing Crosby's rise, Hollywood film companies all spent huge sums of money to recruit singers from the music industry. Thus, in recent times, singers have had the luckiest period in Hollywood, which is an inevitable trend since the discovery of sound films.</p>
<p>Bing Crosby only has a three-year history in Hollywood. When he first arrived in Hollywood, his first song was a segment from a song. Because his voice was famous in the American music scene, his first performance received praise from many critics as a voice that "lingered for three days". This song was inserted into the Paramount production "The Big Broadcast", and Bing Crosby was officially hired as an actor by Paramount.</p>
<p>Following Bing Crosby, the singer was Kate Smith. When she performed at the Broadway Music Association, although she often didn't have time to go on stage until late at night, her fans never left until dawn. The magic of her singing was also amazing. Paramount, admiring her reputation, paid a large sum of money to bring her into the film industry. After joining Paramount, she only made one film, "Hello Everybody", and became a movie star like Bing Crosby, because she was a singer. Paramount Company was the first to hire singers to be actors in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Paramount's two singers were highly praised by critics, so Fox, RKO, Warner Brothers, Columbia and other major companies also successively hired well-known singers from the Broadway music scene. At the same time, the status of movie stars who were also singers suddenly rose. At this time, film industry figures all competed to practice their voices in order to maintain their position in the film world. Even Greta Garbo and John Gilbert had to practice singing, and it almost became a trend that anyone who couldn't sing was not worthy of being a film industry figure.</p>
<p>More recently, the trend of Hollywood worshiping singers has reached its peak. Since January of this year, about twenty singers have entered the film industry in Hollywood, and their salaries are higher than those of ordinary movie stars. Therefore, Mr. Big Nose Jimmy Durante also often went to the music academy to practice singing. Although it seems ridiculous, the general trend can be seen.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e30">Review of "A Woman Commands" <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>The story and direction are ordinary</p>
<p>But the rest is mostly commendable</p>
<p>Pola Negri doesn't have many sound films, and her reputation is far less than it was four or five years ago when she was popular. I saw her in "A Woman Commands", which was shown at the New Light Theater yesterday, and she looked much older. She plays a singer who is in love with a young military officer, and the young military officer, in order to please the singer, not only goes bankrupt but also incurs huge debts. So she took out her own ornaments to pay off his debts for him and left him to resume her singing career. Soon, the king traveled incognito and, at first sight, greatly admired her, inviting her to the palace for a banquet. Soon after, he made her queen. But the soldiers and civilians of the country, long resentful of the king's tyranny, rose up in revolution. The king died, and she, as queen, was also sentenced to death. However, the young military officer devised a plan to intercede, and they left the country together.</p>
<p>Her entire performance was excellent, and the inner expressions in several close-ups were quite moving. The conflict between emotion and reason was revealed in the two scenes of painful parting and taking the position of queen. The king's ambiguous attitude, like love but not love, was just right. The two songs she sang were very tragic. The same song was sung over and over again, but the environment and attitude changed, so even the tones were different, and it wasn't repetitive. Indeed, not only in this film is she the chief, but few Hollywood actresses can match her, right?</p>
<p>Basil Rathbone, who played the young military officer, is a very ordinary playboy with few facial expressions. However, in fact, he is still qualified in the entire film. Roland Young, who played the emperor, was truly wonderful. He portrayed a lecherous and dim-witted king thoroughly... Hollywood's comedic stars</p>
<h3 id="e31">Wheeler and Woolsey <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Ke</p>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai this afternoon</p>
<p>Wheeler and Woolsey, a famous comedic star duo from RKO Pictures, will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon (Saturday) by ship. They are currently traveling around the world on vacation and will stay in Shanghai for a week. The Shanghai branch of RKO is preparing to give them a grand welcome upon their arrival. During their week-long tour of the Paris of the East, they are prepared to do their utmost to entertain them. RKO's Shanghai branch has already organized a welcome committee, headed by the company's general manager Knight and the general manager of Nanyiyi Company, He Tingran, among others. When they arrive at the pier, Chinese music will be played along with a Western music band, and many firecrackers will be set off to add to the excitement. Madie Motor Company has also prepared a Packard car for them to use when touring Shanghai. The films Wheeler and Woolsey have starred in include "Peach O'Reno", "Caught Plastered", "Girl Crazy", and the unreleased "Hold 'Em Jail" and "Diplomaniacs", which Shanghai movie audiences should not have forgotten.</p>
<p>, although there are excesses, it is thorough and makes people applaud. Two supporting roles, one the singer's maid and the other the Minister of the Interior, also performed the essence of humor, making people laugh non-stop with every word and action.</p>
<p>There are many beautiful shots, the most wonderful being the singer looking out at the street scene from the window, a scene of ice and snow, which is more beautiful than any picture. The sets are also quite grand. The scene changes are very compact, and although there are many dialogues, they are very interesting and the pronunciation is clear.</p>
<p>The entire play does not reveal the historical background. If it is said to be a historical drama, the costumes, sets, and dialogues are mostly modern. If it is a new script, then why do so many customs and habits seem to be from a time before today? It is truly somewhat illogical. Moreover, the attitude of the ministers toward the king is too outrageous. The screenwriter seems to have lost control.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the actors were all very good, otherwise, this film would have been very mediocre and dull.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Review of "The Property Man" <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>A patchwork of old fragments,</p>
<p>Yet surprisingly sells out.</p>
<p>A while ago, I saw "A Streetcar Named Desire" once. Not long ago, the Nanjing Grand Theater showed "The Policeman," both of which were Charlie Chaplin's past works. Given the audience's great desire for the works of this "King of Comedy," they naturally flocked to see them, drawn by the prominent advertisements in the newspapers. Similarly, under such circumstances, "The Property Man" emerged in response to the demand.</p>
<p>The so-called "Property Man" is pieced together from many old films of Chaplin's from over a decade ago. Naturally, it lacks a coherent plot. Although the opportunistic film merchant put in great effort to connect the pieces back and forth, trying to convince the audience that this is "one" film, there is no consistent story in it.</p>
<p>The content is roughly as follows: Chaplin first works as a bartender in a bar, causing a ruckus. He suddenly meets a noble woman, attends a banquet, and causes another ruckus. Later, he participates in a car race, sporting not only his signature mustache but also two strands of hair on his chin. Then, somehow, he becomes a stage property man, naturally getting into several fights and tumbling around. (At this point, the chin hairs suddenly disappear.) Finally, he becomes a referee for a boxing match, still causing a great commotion.</p>
<p>Since the plot is as described above, Charlie Chaplin lacks a consistent character portrayal from beginning to end, so there is nothing to critique.</p>
<p>Being an old film from over a decade ago, the screening is naturally rough and the dubbing is extremely childish.</p>
<p>In short, this film is a prank by an opportunistic film merchant. However, yesterday it was almost a sold-out show in Paris, showing how unexpectedly appealing Chaplin still is.</p>

<p>— Siping</p>
<p>Dillon's car arrived. He got out of the car, helping Enloewell out, and announced to everyone that this was the future star. Everyone was very disappointed to hear this. They all knew that En was not capable of replacing Dorsay. Dillon, because En was even more flattering than Dorsay, tried his best to persuade Mashie, guaranteeing that she could become a big star. After hearing Dillon's compliments, En opened her mouth and said, "To be honest, I am not qualified enough. But I know there is someone in this group who is very suitable. Mr. Mashie, as long as you can try her."</p>
<p>"Who is that?" Mashie asked.</p>
<p>"Pansy Shadyou," En said. "Marsh said," Mr. Mashie, listen. I have been waiting for such an opportunity for many years. If I didn't believe she was the best, how could I miss the opportunity myself?"</p>
<p>"Ask her to come in," Mashie said immediately without thinking.</p>
<p>Since the "Beautiful Women" dance performance had Pansy as the star, it opened on that evening at the time announced in the advertisement. Everyone felt nervous that day, and Pansy's heart was beating especially fast: she felt so nervous that she seemed to lose her emotions. But that night…</p>
<p>That night, even people who don't usually go to the theater were sure to see the scene where Pansy fell into Pylai's arms, which was not like watching a play at all, but like watching a real love affair. The love song in that scene was TINPANALLEY, but Pylai sang this love song in a soft and charming tone, unmatched by any musical comedy.</p>
<p>That night, Pansy was doubly happy because, before the curtain rose, Dorsay hobbled into her dressing room.</p>
<p>"When I came here tonight," Dorsay said, "I originally wanted to pull out all your hair. Then I changed my mind. I think I have fulfilled my wish, and now it's your chance. You like fame, maybe you can become famous. As for me, I love Pant. We can get married tomorrow."</p>
<p>After the curtain call, Pylai went to Pansy's dressing room.</p>
<p>"Listen, honey," he said to Pansy, "I was just about to tell you, I..."</p>
<p>"Please say it," Pansy urged.</p>
<p>"I think this is a bit funny," Pylai stammered, unable to say it. "Doesn't this already make you understand?"</p>
<p>Pylai pulled her into his arms, then lifted her face towards him, and his lips slowly approached hers. This must not be a stage kiss (The End)</p>
