<p>時評</p>
<h3>歡迎東北抗日諸將軍梓</h3>
<p>邇日馬占山蘇炳文李杜諸將軍。海外歸來。集居滬上。市商會總工會及義勇軍後援會等團體。以諸將軍艱苦抗日。爲民族奮鬥。事雖失敗功有足念。特於本日聯合開會歡迎之。上海各團體於諸將軍領導義軍在東北抗敵之日。曾募集巨欵。匯送接濟。兩方連繫本有可言。然半載以前。各盡其分互相依助。以期同達救國禦侮之目的。初不料至於今日。此開會歡迎者。不免因華北休戰而爲感傷鬱憤之羣衆。被歡迎者亦竟成失敗之英雄也。悵憶前事。審觀現局。欷嘘何似。</p>
<p>今日歡迎之會。與會者得藉以暢聆愛國軍人之談述戰蹟。發抒偉論。諸將軍亦得藉以與上海愛國團體爲實際之接觸。此不可不認爲有意義之事。而吾人乘此機會。一述所見。以貢獻於諸將軍。亦吾人之幸也。</p>
<p>吾人之所期於諸將軍者。第一爲繼續努力。以求貫澈抗日之初衷。諸將軍雖爲敵所迫。離開其部屬。然東北抗日健兒之轉戰入察者萬餘人。由俄入新疆者。數亦近萬。在東北散居不變抗日之心者。更不知有若干。此皆百戰勁卒。始終不忘國仇者也。諸將軍今後將如何領導此項軍隊以爲國家努力乎。失地未復國仇未銷。諸將軍及所部。今後正大有可爲也。第二爲樹立愛國軍人之模範。以改變國内軍界之風氣。二十年冬嫩江一單國内勇於内戰之軍人讀戰報而知恥各地人民。聞風奮興。雖鮮毀家紓難頗多踴躍輸將。其後各軍繼起抗敵。分别給與軍人及社會人士以道德的剌激亦自不少。今諸將軍繞道歐洲歸來。所見所聞必有可以爲自身修養之助。而足資國内軍人取法者。其何以增高自己之人格。而改變國内軍界之風氣乎。</p>
<p>目前諸將軍之境遇。頗爲艱難而諸將軍在國人心目中之地位則極爲優良。以前對日作戰。雖告失敗。而國人之敬仰與同情。曾未稍减今日之歡迎。即國人對愛國軍人誠意之表示。願諸將軍此後有以副國人之期望。并有以成就其勳業。謹舉二端。以代歡迎之詞。</p>

<p>（倫敦）世界經濟大會現注視美元之變化、美元匯價現已與從前對英幣之合價相近、因此主幹部不欲遽即决定大會工作應否繼續問題、此種觀望政策、不爲旁觀者所詫異、一星期前法財長龐萊曾豫料、美國在一星期内或可準備討論幣價穏定問題、此說今似稍近、用金國某員語路透訪員、謂美元跌至可使美代表討論穏定之點時、用金國即將撤回其會務進行之反對云、用金國代表今日仍堅持貨幣問題、未曾參加貨幣委員會會議、（十日路透電）</p>

<h3>英法當局說明對經濟會方針</h3>
<p>（倫敦）財相張伯倫今日下午對下議院說明英國對經濟會議之政策、法比阿根廷巴西等國大使、瑞士公使及其他多數參加經濟會議之代表團均到塲旁聽、張伯倫首先叙述世界經濟會議如何召集及開會之情形、旋謂貨幣之心須穏定、爲各國所一致贊成者、但欲其即時實現則不可能、因若干國家以爲暫時應先與關稅休戰、同時成立貨幣休戰、易詞言之、即貨幣之暫時穏定是也、在經濟會議開會以前、法英美三國中央銀行代表、即同意照此意義進行、無如白宮對臨時穏定貨幣之計畫、予以拒絶、以致三國中央銀行之同意、等於取銷、除此以外、尙有第二企圖、以渠視之、殊覺無害、即請求各國政府禁止投機是也、此項企圖、亦爲美國政府所拒絶、因之經濟會議之生命、發生問題、而與會之國家中維持金本位者、與貨幣自由者、分爲兩派、至今無法調和、張伯倫至是又作樂觀語、謂「經濟會議之任務、畢竟不能認爲無益、其形勢亦已明瞭、會議所受之打擊雖頗嚴重、但非致命之傷、爲預備最後之解决計、會議前途尙大有可爲、英國政府之主要目的、仍爲提高物價、但吾人以爲貨幣問題中之若干要素、雖爲恢復經濟之前提、然提高物價一層、終不能有所待於貨幣上之行動、」張氏結論謂、凡怱促想出而未加思索之辦法、均應規避、國會尤應使政府與到會之所有國家、能維持親善之關係、」云（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）内閣於下午三時舉行會議、由總理達拉第主席、對財長龐萊對於經濟會議所取之態度、一致贊成、又有人表示法國宜僅與維持金本位各國、與法國政策相同者、繼續談判商務、但未作任何决策、因如金本位國家、擬以如何基礎進行談判、法國必先知之、始能有所决定也、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄舉行憲法成立紀念</h3>

<p>主席褚慧僧致詞云、今日東北義勇軍、後援會歡迎馬·蘇·李·張·等司令、及抗日各軍長各代表、因爲後援會與諸位歷有極密切之關係、儼如家人、無庸客氣、竊自九一八以後、滬市民衆、卽知首先抗日者爲馬占山將軍、所以莫不表極熱烈之同情、非僅上海、全國亦莫不如是、卽國外橋胞、國際各友邦、亦均表同情、蓋日本不顧國際條約、罔恤正義、以侵略中國之主權領土、在彼日本以爲中國决無人能抵抗、孰知我馬主席當時便不顧一切、奮起抗敵、嫩江橋一役、是其尤著者、嗣後我李杜將軍亦繼起抗日支撑甚久最後蘇司令復在滿洲里仗義抗日、不顧一切、與日週旋、此種精神、我民衆深爲欽佩、而尤屬難能可貴者、當時日本對各位將軍、曾賄之以財、餌之以祿、用種種引誘方法、而各將軍不爲所動、眞所謂志堅金石、而於困苦艱難之中、堅持一年之久、亦惟此種精神庶克當之、所以民衆對於三將軍、能表示十二分之熱忱、亦卽在此、東北義勇軍後援會之組織、原冀對抗日英雄、表示援助、終因力量關係、未能充分接濟、致使諸將軍卒以彈盡援絶而退却、此後援會所最慚愧、而引爲餘憾者、亦　能使三位將軍到收復東北失地、民衆方面、至少由應負極大的責任、自不得已而退入俄境後、輾轉返國、正擬再整旗鼓、繼續抗日、但國内停戰恊定已簽字、此時將軍遂亦不得不隠忍一下、現在諸位還是始終抱抗日精神、故後援會除對諸位過去表示十二分歡迎外、尤其是歡迎諸位的今後之奮鬥、同時希望我後援會同人及民衆方面、亦應加倍努力、以作後盾、使將來抗日之時、無論精神上物質上有充分之接濟、最後警祝諸將軍康健、</p>

<p>繼由李杜將軍起立答詞云、今日承後援會設宴招待、感激之餘、很是慚愧、竊自九一八事變後、其時東北四省、猶未全亡、馬將軍嫩江橋抗之於前、其後兄弟等追之於後、勉力支持、結果東三省仍未收回、個人亦未爲國犧牲、甚至退却之時、受第三國解除武裝、忍痛海外、今雖安然返國、實覺羞見國内父老、上海爲國内第一大都市、在歷史上對於革命事業、無一不予以極大援助、此次在東北抗日之時、我等所得到的捐欵甚多、使我等能作戰年餘、皆係滬上援助之力、迨自失敗以後、避難民衆、復蒙收容、設法安置、此種精神、實與前敵作戰相同、頃見主席勉同人將來繼續抗日、在余個人之意、已往抗日、已告一段落、失敗亦係事實、現東北三千萬民衆、受暴日蹂躪、痛苦已至極點、所以東北一日不收回、我儕責任、一日未完、將來抗日、仍須後援會積極準備、則此後之機會甚多、現在日本佔領東北、究如强盜搶刦行爲、我國尙有許多省土地人民、决不至連三省都不能收回、歐戰之時、巴爾幹波蘭之獨立、可爲前鑒、此後抗日、尤當從民族方面着想、我國民族、近數十年來、歷史演進、政治轉變、究竟是有良好之進展、倘或民心不死、一息尙存、能不斷奮鬥、不但東三省可收回、卽雄視世界、亦未嘗不能辦到、以後當本着主義、認淸日本爲仇敵、國民責任、不尙空談、掮槍者作戰、不掮槍者接濟、前後打成一氣、則機會一至、卽我發奮爲雄之時云云、</p>
<h3>馬占山演說</h3>
<p>當此炎署、蒙東北義勇軍後援會招待歡迎、極爲銘感、茲僅表意見兩點、㈠對後援會抱愧、㈡對全國海内外同胞抱醜、蓋吾軍旣未能保守東北疆土、又未以身殉國、此爲軍人絶大恥辱、此次在歸國途中、聞停戰恊定簽定、知政府對抗日方針、有所籌劃改變、但我等以抗日立塲言、其意志與精神、當永矢勿渝、在舟中卽已誓言、東北一日不收復、我等之責任一日不了、至此爲止、唯現在最所令人痛心者、卽環顧國内、尙有不少人躭溺於個人利益之爭取、致令中央當局、尙多感困難、最後有須聲明者、卽吾儕前次在東北之成績、絶非我等個人之能力所致、此實係全體東北民衆及全國海内外同胞及後援會之成績、此後救國機會正多、仍於後援會隨時予我等以精神與物質之援助與支持、足不僅個人所切盼者也、</p>
<h3>蘇炳文演說</h3>
<p>今夜得此機會、與諸君歡聚一堂、極爲榮幸、如禇慧僧先生所言、我等原爲一家、亦不須歌詞褥飾、蓋有九一八之變、始有抗日軍事之起、然後亦始有滬上東北義勇軍後援會之成立、當時本人率部倉促應付日寇、事先旣無整個準備、事後復與中央隔絶、孤軍奮戰、倘無後援會之精神的鼓勵與物質的接濟、實難持續、但終以彈盡援絶、被迫退俄、其間經過詳情、此時亦不必多所鰲言、保土殺敵、爲軍人天職、當時總期武力抵抗、多維持一日、藉爲外交鬥爭、多增一分力量、不料結果所依賴於國聯之公道處置、及所謂條約之制裁等等、竟皆成畫餅、致令今日得一教訓、卽欲求禦悔救國、唯有靠自己力量、今後如東北三千萬民衆之心不死、全國海内外同胞之民氣不餒、失地自有收復之一日、日前許多人皆以華北停戰而自隨其抗日之志、殊不知停戰恊定、爲政府整個之對外方針、而吾人之志願、則爲民族振作生機、根本所繫、斷不可隨外表形勢而移轉者也、本人爲軍人對救國之盡力、仍不外肩槍殺數、爲民衆之先鋒、唯願後援會諸同志、繼續作其後盾、以貫澈此民族歷史上光榮之一頁、謹與諸君共勉云云、後復有新自黑龍江來滬之樸炳珊將軍、報告最近東北形勢、意雋言摯、極爲沉痛悲壯、曁張子廉等人演說、詞長不錄、</p>

<h3>納稅會復同業公會</h3>

<h3>經委會整理蠶絲業成績</h3>
<p>國聯蠶絲業專家瑪利博士試騐成功全國經濟委員會副委員長宋子文氏、前以我國蠶絲業日趨衰落、若不亟謀復興、關係吾國經濟前途、實匪淺鮮、爰由經濟委員會研究辦法、並於上年春間、特向國聯當局、聘請蠶絲專家瑪利博士來華、考察蠶絲事業、以資改良、瑪利博士前曾迭就江浙兩省產絲區域視察、將考查經過及應改良各點、撰製報告書、一一詳述、報告當局、旋於江浙兩省、設立模範區及改良區、開始實行、試騐結果、本年春繭收成、開三十年未有之產額紀錄、茲將詳</p>
<p>情分誌於下、</p>
<h3>教導飼育</h3>
<p>自經濟委員會當局、通盤籌劃、一面由瑪利博士建議、即在江浙兩省、分設模範及改良區、瑪利博士復親往杭縣工作、實行規定計劃、使用改良蠶種、共育稚蠶至二齡、並設立指導所、專司教導蠶户飼育方法、隨時加以研究與改良、</p>
<h3>成績優良</h3>
<p>本年春繭、經研究改良、收成極佳、竟超過近三十年來最高產額、繭價平均每擔四十元、在無錫且高至六十元、惟農民之本種則仍收成不良、約計損失少收蠶繭十萬擔、計銀四百萬元之鉅、</p>
<h3>設模範區</h3>
<p>浙江省建設廳曾於今春闢蕭山及臨安爲育蠶模範區、訓練指導員六十人、分往該兩區指導、嗣又增設杭縣嘉興海鹽三地、爲模範區、並添設秋蠶指導員訓練所、招收學員三百人、開始訓練、如人員衆多、尙須作大規模之擴充</p>
<h3>意華交種</h3>
<p>前者經委員會發出之意華交雜黄色蠶種、成績頗佳、江浙兩省農民、多不願將是項蠶繭出售、一律保存、自繅土絲、蓋因其絲量豐腴也、至江浙兩省所產意華交雜種之繭、業經杭錫兩處絲廠試繅、成績亦頗良好、遠勝白繭</p>
<h3>繼續試騐</h3>
<p>中央現爲提倡改良蠶種起見、决定今秋及來春、繼續試騐、如收穫成色能與今春相埒、則將來中國蠶絲、從此復興、目下江浙兩省之絲廠、泰半均已開車、僅無錫方面、因缺乏人工、約有十餘家、尙未開車耳、</p>

<h3>吃飯問題</h3>
<p>— 煌</p>
<p>人生，還有什麽吃飯問題，這倒也希奇。</p>
<p>傳聞修道之人三年（？）不吃飯，便可成仙，在小時節，也曾聽過不吃飯的修道士的故事，說是修道者披着袈裟，戴着禪帽，兩手合拱，閉着眼，口唸南無阿彌陀佛，年年月月盤坐在深山中的木籠裏，木籠祗有一個僅可供人供納香火之　的小圓洞，人是無論如何不能從洞裏出進。小孩們和好奇的人偷偷的窺探着，看那修道者到度吃不吃飯，畢竟没有發現過一次。雖然那修道者後來究竟有没有成仙，没有人知道，但他的不吃飯，似乎是千真萬確的。</p>
<p>據我所知，西洋人也不大吃飯，不過却愛吃麵包牛肉雞蛋之類。我們中國北方人也不大吃飯，可是得吃大麵，窩窩頭，餑餑，没有那些東西吃，也得吃樹皮黄土。弄得樹皮黄土没有吃然後纔肯一命歸天，去做仙人。</p>
<p>由此看來，可知修道者不吃飯可成仙，凡俗之輩，没有飯吃，也可成仙，異途同歸，毫無意義。那末，飯之吃與不吃，簡直是不成問題的。</p>
<p>聽說西歐還有一種人，那是近代發明的人，不是爲着要成仙，却是要做俗人，能做俗人所要做的事，也不吃飯，不過要吃些電。這可是我們所謂「三敎九流」之外的一流人物。</p>
<p>至於中國呢，不讓西歐專美，近來却發明了一種人，旣不肯成仙，又不愛吃樹皮黄土，没有飯吃，却偏要吃飯，成羣結隊，由這兒湧到那兒，搶米，滋事，總愛鬧得有飯吃的人不高興。神筋病發作了似的，你不要他們吃，他們偏要吃，那末，究竟他們吃什麽呢？他們吃着「押解出境「。這樣一來，於是這地方太平了，這地方的人高興了。</p>
<p>但是他們吃着」押解出境」之後又怎麽辦呢？當然　在那地方又是吃着「押解出境」。最後是　他們吃押「解出國門」。吃着「押解出世界」。但結果也終是修了道，成了仙了。</p>
<p>人世間，芸芸的衆生，人人修道成仙，不做凡夫俗子。或者做着「三數九流」之外的另一種人，那末，天下太平了。不吃飯眞是好事情。</p>
<p>人生，還有什麽吃飯問題，這倒也希奇。</p>
<h3>裸體與測字</h3>
<p>— 翼</p>
<p>上海是中國接受新文明的第一個所在，彷彿人的一張嘴，由嘴吃入腹中，再運行全身；八十年來，種種新文明由上海介紹入内地，攻破了五千年來古文明的壁壘。就常理而言：上海便應該日進於文明，只使人見到新文明不斷地輸入，絶不應該還有腐敗的留存，更不能容許内地的腐敗勢力反攻到上海來。可是事實上竟不然，新文明儘管輸入，舊腐敗依舊留存，而且也確是由内地反攻過來的，這矛盾，目前我便同時發現到兩者的實證。</p>
<p>裸體運動自香港傳到上海，是新文明輸入的實證。同時由新閘路首端之西藏路至新垃圾橋堍之西藏路止，一段很短的路旁，新有了十幾個測字灘，差不多石路上的衣莊，直隸路上的木器店；其間還來着幾個相面的，畫一張人體圖張掛在牆上，便算是一個攤，向來頗冷落的人行道上，有了這十幾個攤頭，居然熱鬧起來。再看那攤主人，一個個都是鳩形鵠面，衣衫不整，本没有信任他們斷事决疑的餘地。然而事實上又不然，每個攤前都陸續有人光顧，熱誠地信任他們。如果住在上海的人都沾着點文明氣味，不信任他們，他們就也没有存在的餘地。惟其信任測字先生能爲人斷事决疑指示迷津的還是居於絶大多數，他們纔都認上海可立足，不斷地由内地湧來。這裏不過說是新有的十幾個攤，若論全上海，只怕幾百以至於幾千個攤也是有的。</p>
<p>裸體運動輸入上海，有人主張禁止；這成千成百阻礙文明進化的測字攤，就没有人注意到了！</p>
<h3>奇怪</h3>
<p>— 葉弈願</p>
<p>奇怪，在市上有許多的商店，他們都是藉了廣告和宣傳的力量，來做着他們的生意；而獨有經售鴉片的店家，偏不需宣傳和廣告，而能使顧客會知道了，悄悄地來買。</p>
<p>奇怪，在上海有很多的商店，是終年不斷地掛着大减價大犧牲二十一天的大旗幟！</p>
<p>奇怪，當一個男子，在無意間聽到了女子的話聲，或是一個女子在他跟前走過時；他總會掉轉頭來望一望。</p>
<p>奇怪，一般大慈善家大教育家，在嘴裏喊得一篇救國之聲；而偏不能注意於街頭巷尾的無數失學兒童；更不能於此無數的失學兒童之中，教育出很多的救國的未來壯士！</p>
<p>奇怪，一個身當重任的小學教師，而他的酬報；猶不如一個工人，一個僕役，與一個乞丐那樣子。</p>
<p>奇怪，如果設立學校的目的是爲教育而教育的；那末，何以在窮鄉僻巷與乎貧民窟中，偏没有教育的塲所？難道是那裏没有兒童嗎？</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十一回俯首許婚姻芳情脈脈開心到士卒喜氣洋洋</p>
<p>江氏耳朶雖在聽黄太太說話，兩隻眼睛。自然是完全射在桂枝身上。桂枝兩手按在膝蓋上，自己低了頭去看自己的手，什麽話也不說。黄太太自然也是很明白江氏的意思，他自己是千肯萬肯，只是不知道姑娘的意思，究竟怎麽樣，所以江氏說的話，總是不着邊際，而且說話的時候，態度很是不安，好像怕說出話來，會引起姑娘的反對似的。黄太太知道這一道關鍵，完全引到桂枝身上去了，這就向桂枝身邊走來，挨着他的椅子邊坐下，然後用手按着桂枝的手道：大姑娘，你有話只管說。若是你願意的話，那倒没有什麽。假如你是不願意，囉哩囉唆，我們只管說下去，那是多麽討厭。桂枝低了頭，臉不免紅紅的，被人道着，不知怎樣是好。現在黄太太說到討厭兩個字，這讓他不能再行默爾了，便故意扳着臉道：喲！您這是笑話，我們怎麽敢當呢？黄太太笑道：這樣子說，你是不反對的了，那麽，就照着這個樣子望下說。你瞧怎麽樣？桂枝聽了，却是不作聲。黄太太道：說呀！究竟怎麽樣？說着，他就伸手在桂枝的肩膀上，輕輕的拍着。江氏道：你這孩子，人家黄太太好心好意的，和咱們說話，咱們好意思，不理人家嗎？桂枝板住臉道：有話你不會對人說嗎？老逼着我說，逼得我怪難爲情的。說畢，他又禁不住一偏頭笑了。黄太太向曼英看時，曼英連連點了兩下頭。黄太太笑道：這個樣子，大槪是不成問題的了，明天你寄封快信到西苑去，讓小田向趙連長通一個消息，呌他也好寛心。只要彼此兩家都願意了，這事就算是定規，至於放完那些事情，這幾天，倒也没有關係。曼英道：你這話就說的不對，你說，兩家願意，就算定規，那是我們的看法，若照當事人說，不放完，人家是不會放心的。（一二七）</p>
<h3>紅丸</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>普通人的糧食，是飯，癮君子的糧食，也是飯。普通人吃的是「白飯」癮君子吃的，也是「白飯」，不過同時還要吃「黑飯」。據說「黑飯」的滋味，比了「白飯」還要好，「白飯」只可以修葺五臟廟，「黑飯」更進一步，能開七孔十八竅，所以「黑飯」一名「福壽膏」。</p>
<p>「白飯」不是人人有福分吃的，只以上海而論，至少當有百分之幾十幾的不着長衫同志，，是把大餅，油條，油豆腐，線粉，當做一日三餐的。「黑飯」也如此，不是人人有福分吃的。黑飯中的大餅油條，據說，就是「紅丸」，此道中人，呌做「紅珠子」。</p>
<p>近來報上時常用大字標題，登着「查紗紅丸機關」，「破獲紅丸窟」等重要消息，這就夠明白「紅丸」的得人之深。</p>
<p>據吸「紅丸」的内家言，吸鴉片，是貴族化的。在目下，腰包裏没有二八開，莫想一榻兮横陳，吞雲而吐霧，惟有「紅珠子」手中有十來個子，就可使巳動員的鼻涕眼淚，立即復員。猶如吃「白飯」，上小飯店，三塊鹹肉頭腐，一小一陽春，連堂帶小，也得二百八十個大錢，二個大餅，二根油條，將來美麥一到，或許還不到十二個子。</p>
<p>吸「紅丸」的，進步之速，骨些匪夷所思。所謂「進步」也者，烟癮日增月盛之謂也。譬如第一天吸三十顆夠了，第二天最好加五顆，第三天非吸四十顆，便要覺得心中老大不舒服。「有進無退」這是吸者的口號，於是乎「紅丸製造家」，不得不「擴充營業」，「加工趕製」。</p>
<p>在下有一天問一位「紅丸消費者」道；聽說吸食「紅丸」的，不上十年，逃不出鬼門關的，可有這許？他却很幽默地說道，反正不吸「紅丸」，三天也挨不過哪。</p>
<p>逰踪所至</p>
<h3>世界博覽會記遊（一）</h3>
<p>— 黄覺明</p>
<p>記者按：黄君覺民自一九三一年得菲律濱大學教育碩士後，卽往美國哥倫比亞大學師範院研究所專攻教育心理學，獲得該院教育心理學教授專科畢業證書，此次還國，道經芝加哥，適在世界博覽會開幕之日，遂留芝遊覽兩天，以其目擊述之如下，以饗國人。</p>
<p>㈠槪况</p>
<p>世界博覽會，係美國芝加哥市民發起，邀請各　國加入，用以紀念該市百年進步者。日期自五月二十七至十一月一日。地點在芝加哥城密西根湖濱。周圍四百二十四英畝。耗費一千餘萬金元。槪由該會發起人及維持員捐墊，未受中央及省市政府分文津貼。不若前此一八九三年一九零四年及一九一五年三次博覽會，皆受政府少則七八百萬元，多則千餘萬元之資𦔳也。該會於一九二八年二月卽開始籌備，至今年開幕日，尙有幾處陳列，未能供人遊覽，規模之大，可想而知。</p>
<p>會之標語爲「百年進步。」目的在使參觀者知百年來丨丨一八三三至一九三三丨丨科學之發明，實業之應用，及人類之享受。所建陳列屋宇，多無窗户，内中空氣光綫，皆由機譽之供給。</p>
<p>㈡科學陳列所</p>
<p>余因對科學具有特殊興趣，而又爲該會最注重之點，乃先往科學陳列所（圖一）參觀。所爲英文Ｕ字形，大三英畝，内陳數學，天文，物理，化學，生物，地質，及醫學七種，成績稱爲基本科學。除天文另列天文館外，其他六種均陳於此。</p>
<p>㈠數學部陳列許多演算機器，並予表演算法。使觀者明瞭數學應用於人生日常生活。較深者則爲表演三角學如何應用於航海，地球各部標準時間如何算得。更深者如密測孫氏Ｍichelson之斷定光的速率之機器，哥豋氏Ｇolron製成常態，曲線之機器，以及其他許多機器，雖經主其事者用簡易方法群爲解釋，猶非常人所得明白。</p>
<p>㈡物理部此處觀者得以解答以下數問題：如空氣在橡皮車輪中何以可抵重壓？湯汽與熱水化合何以能發生壓力？電力在冰箱内如何發生凍力？聲音如何發生，如何傳佈？有聲電影如何發聲？遠望鏡顯微鏡如何構造？光線如何反射如何波折？眼鏡如何糾正眼之視力？如何測知光波之長爲一寸之百萬分之二十。又肉眼因科學之𦔳且可在此窺見最微細之物質成分如電子及布露湯Ｐrolon等。Ｘ光線之無微不透，亦於此部見之。</p>
<p>在物理部鄰近大房中陳列探海家比伯威廉氏Ｗilliam　Beebe海洋沉入半英里所乘之鋼球及探空家畢加氏Ａuguste　Piccard升上空中十英里所乘之汽球，此房南端所陳列者則爲組成地球之九十三種化學分子。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>諒解</h3>
<p>— 周不齋</p>
<p>近來到處充滿了「諒解」的呼聲，小自個人的相與，大至國際的往來，對外要求諒解，對内也謀諒解。同時，對外諒解了，又要諒解於内；對内諒解了，才能諒解於外。甚矣諒解之要且難也！</p>
<p>諒解的方面雖不同，但目的却祇有一個，就是和平。換言之，也就是維持現狀。</p>
<p>諒解的眞締爲「人之相知，貴相知心」。分别言之，就是在人不要責備太過，在己另有一番苦心或者隠痛。這樣，彼此方便了，「兩全」了。所以諒解的究極階段是「莫逆於心」。不然，「莫我知也夫」，那是怎樣不幸的事。</p>
<p>諒解看來好像是相互的，實則往往是片面的，要人諒解者常首先就不諒解别人，不使别人諒解，甚至有時自己也不諒解自己。舉例言之，袁世凱僞造民意，原是要人諒解的。但民意而至僞造，顯係違反民意，已不諒解人了；不想遵從民意，偏去僞造民意，已是不使别人諒解了；僞造民意的本身已是知道民意的重要，明知而又僞造，可知自己也不諒解自己了。不諒解人，又不使人諒解，自己也不諒解自己，那麽，誰諒解誰呢？丨誰不要誰諒解呢？要人諒解的本身，根本已經矛盾了，已是不諒解了。如果能「知人」，使「人知」，又能「自知」，誰要誰諒解呢？丨誰不諒解誰呢？諒解往往是片面的，丨不求諒解的諒解，片面的而又不是片面的。</p>
<p>有人以爲中國人缺乏諒解的情素，是一切紛爭的由來。其實却是事事求諒解，結果事事仍不諒解，事事不諒解，結果却又事事諒解，中國人便老吃諒解的虧。這自然不僅是片面的諒解，又是部局的諒解了。</p>
<h3>讀「文學」創刊號</h3>
<p>— 另境</p>
<p>一想起這三十多位作者寫這些文章時的辛勞，幾乎使我不敢在這裏嘵知了。僅以一天時間讀完了幾十個人幾個月的勞績（自然這裏也得加上排印者的辛勞），而輕輕加上一句「好」或「不好」的評語，我以爲是最殘忍的事。這是讀者和作者間永遠的不調和，而這責任自然在讀者。</p>
<p>因此，我是不欲以評者的地位而出現，這或許比較可以减輕一些負担。</p>
<p>現在去觀察一種純文藝雜誌的内容，重要的是在它所包含的創作，因爲目下正是一個暴風急雨的時代，若一種純文藝雜誌而不能多多地形象地反映了這時代的，無疑是很少價値可說。北平的幾種文藝雜誌似乎没有注意到這一點，而「文學」的編者們是把握了的。</p>
<p>現在是正當一個文人苦悶極了的時代，只要不是喫指揮刀下飯的文人，誰都要想把文學作爲申訴革悶的工具。「文學」編者聲言他們這雜誌的内容是「雜」的，但讀完了全書，使我們感受到一種統一的氣氛，那就是時代重壓的憤恨和抗議。</p>
<p>我自然比較注意地讀了其中的十籍創作，但不禁使我連帶發生一些感想起來。中國新文學運動到現在不過十三四年，作家之從事創作最多也不過十一二年，比之外國的三四十年從事創作活動的自還算不得老作家，但我彷彿覺得中國作家們的創作力太容易衰老似的，往往不能給新進者以「老當益壯」的興奮，把創作的範圍狹隘到身邊雜事，他們自然也想要表現這時代，但很少能夠引起讀者實感，這解答只能求之於作家的生活上了。這裏，幾位新進作家的作品，就顯示了他們旺盛的創作力，而且比較能多給讀者一點實感的共鳴作用。不過我對於「五月的支那」和「普姬」兩篇處女作，却懷着一點很不好的感想，「五月的支那」的没有内容實在還超過穆時英的「五個夜總會裏的人」，我只能說它一聲無不聊；「普姬」也是極無意義的東西，不能算是文藝創作，風俗記事而已。我以爲無名作家的處女作固應提倡，但應該先從有内容有社會意義的一點上鼓勵，這是時代給我們的要求，不知「文學」編者以爲如何？</p>
<p>創刋號内有該社徵文「五四文學運動之歷史的意義」六篇。這實在是一個難題目，做這個題目的人要對社會科學的理論有相當的研究，對中國的經濟史要熟悉，對中國文學史自然更應有唯物史觀的理解，而這題目的著重點顯然在五四文學運動的社會基礎和這運動對後來的影響兩點上，然在短短的一二千字内如何能說得明白呢！所以成績就不大好，有的忘記了歷史的意義，有的僅僅說了這運動的社會基礎，有的没有把這一運動安置在一定的社會基礎上，有的纏夾了反封建運動不是資產階級運動。於此亦可見中國文人對於自己所處的時代的理解還是極不充分的。</p>
<p>魯迅先生的一篇「又論『第三種人』」，文短而精，在意義的重要而簡明外，他老人家的筆調又是幽默之至。</p>
<p>「文學」的出現自然不是偶然的，從它的「社談」裏就可知乃是時代重壓下的一種反抗的呼聲，該刋「社談」裏說：「我們這一羣人丨丨當然有一個共同的憬憧丨丨丨到光明之路。凡是足以障礙到這光明之路的一切，無論是個人，是集團，是制度，是主義，我們都要認作我們的仇敵丨丨丨要詛咒它，誅伐它，掃除它。」我和其他的「文學」讀者們就以此期望它的前進吧！</p>
<p>拉雜寫來，仍不免有「眼高手低」之請。</p>
<h3>舊書新話</h3>
<p>— 鳳吾</p>
<p>㈥</p>
<p>康熙皇帝在北京想吃二千五百里外的揚子江裏的　魚，於是臣民大忙其　魚進貢。據當時山東按察司參議張能麟疏，謂：</p>
<p>竊計　產於江南之揚子江，達於京師，計程二千五百餘里。進貢之員，每三十里一塘，竪立旗竿。日則懸旌，夜則懸燈。通計備馬三千餘匹，役夫數千人。東省山路崎嶇，臣見州縣各官，督率人夫，運木治橋，劖石治路，晝夜奔忙，惟恐一時馬蹶，致干重譴。且天氣炎熱，　性不能久延···三省官民，祗爲膳饈一物，驚惶勞疲，官廢職事，民廢耕耘，·····</p>
<p>張能鱗（鳳吾按，此公亦魚也，爲同類乞憐，亦宜矣）以爲這樣是不成的，請求免貢。照這樣看來，爲吃一兩尾魚而弄得天翻地覆，是比現在僅僅修一兩條衣錦歸鄉的公路，徵一點苛捐雜稅，其相差遠矣。文明究竟是現代纔有，彼時可謂黑暗時代哉。走筆至此，眞想馨香祝禱，希望袞袞諸公萬萬年。</p>
<h3>虚弱症患者</h3>
<p>— 衣鳴</p>
<p>虚弱症也是一種很普遍的時代病，患這種病症的人，大槪都是因爲自己身體太壞了緣故，因爲神經感覺例外的靈敏，不但晚上有夢，白天也會夢囈，最特别的，便是時常要眼花。明明前面是一顆樹，他們就當作一個大森林；明明前面祗有一兩個個人，在他們的眼裏，就化做了一大羣，嘴裏更會喊起來。並且大約因爲害怕這一兩個個人，消融在他們所恐懼的那羣人堆裏，於是我們只聽得他們鐙着脚在喪氣的呌着··</p>
<p>「某人被包圍了！」</p>
<p>「某樣東西被包辦了！」</p>
<p>事實上，一切是本來的面目，什麽東西都没有被某羣人包辦過，什麽人也没有被包圍過。倒是因爲他們自己的身體太差，頭昏眼花的結果，由於心理的作用，便會在眼　造成許多的幻象，在自己手造的幻象前，自己倒畏懼起來了。他們便一邊嚇得縮做了一團，一邊却拚命的狂呌着。</p>
<p>他們這樣的狂呌，自以爲可以收到雙重的效用：第一，他們的呌聲也許可以把在眼前黑樾樾的一團嚇跑，那麽那個人也許會歌頌他把這羣人驅走的功德而投在他的脚跟前，再跟在他背後去一起呌，否則，縱使第一着失敗的話，這種尖利的呌聲，至少可以給那個人以一種恐嚇，一種警告，自然，不到幾天，他就要突「圍」而出了。</p>
<p>但是事實上是如何呢？他們的狂呌，不但不能獲得這種意想中的效力，反而因爲他們這種自餒心的表現，使人們更明白這輩人都是患着虚弱症的人，自己的身體已入於非進療養院或解剖室不可的時期，神經過敏得一刻都不能安睡，於是一張眼，只看見東也是一團人，西也是一團人，他内心恐懼自己毀滅的結果，除了狂呌以外，又有什麽方法想呢？</p>
<p>這些虚弱症患者，還是上療養院去求自身健康的回復吧，狂呌是無補於事的。</p>
<h3>道統之夢</h3>
<p>— 達一</p>
<p>嗚呼！人心惟危，道心惟微，惟精惟一，允執厥中。是道也，天下之大道也。堯以是傳之舜，舜以是傳之禹，禹以傳之文武周公，周公傳之孔子。孔子祖述堯舜，憲章文武，而尤向慕於周公，周公因而入夢，及其衰也，乃有久不復夢周公之欺。此道統之夢第一幕也。後漢邊韶，晝日假臥。弟子私嘲之曰，邊孝先，腹便便，懶讀書，但欲眠。韶潛聞之，應曰，邊爲姓，孝爲字，腹便便，五經笥。但欲眠，思經事。寐與周公通夢，靜與孔子同意。師而可嘲，出何典記？但知晝寢之邊胖子，亦以睡夢中與周公通夢，孔子同意自居。此道統之夢第二幕也。明代腐儒最多，講學之風最盛，門户之見亦最深，人皆以肩此道統自任。於是而做道統之夢者多矣。吳與弼康齋文集日錄，常記其夢見文王孔子朱子。如云乙已夢見孔子文王，丙子三月初一日夢訪朱子。五月二十五夜夢孔子之孫，奉孔子之命來訪。辛已食後倦寢，夢朱子父子來枉顧。又稱新居栽竹夜歸，其妻亦夢一老人携二從者，云是孔夫子到此相訪。夢歟夢歟？有鬼有鬼。此道統之夢第三幕也。以戲曲結構擬之，已達頂點矣。楊繼盛自作年譜，記其從韓邦奇學樂律，夜夢虞舜。此道統之夢第四幕也。至羅倫一峯集夢稿二卷，記夢之詞至三百餘首，荒唐悠謬，不可究詰。此道統之夢第五幕也。一部滑稽戲，殆將以此亂彈收煞歟？然而未也。即使今日已無聖人，而此聖聖相傳之道統，傳賢亦可也。奈何今之新史家必曰堯舜無其人，而禹爲爬蟲之類，驚破大賢道統之夢也哉？</p>
<h3>創作小說平凡的事（九）</h3>
<p>— 澹果孫</p>
<p>然而這一天那頓午飯的情形，却和以前不同了，腦袋呢，還是那樣多，聲音呢，遠没有那樣響，儼然有一陣精神上的共同戒嚴，制裁了那些男女老幼，呌大家幾乎都成了面面相覷無精打彩的。這情形就是說「禍在眉睫」了！然而這個禍究竟是甚麽？</p>
<p>所謂禍者，是高麗的覆轍嗎？不然。這些男男女女决不會慮到這件事，並且也許没有幾個人曉得高麗究竟是甚麽！究竟在那裏！那末就是敵人的飛機嗎？不然。他們近來也看慣了，並且也曉得敵人的飛機决不敢擾亂帝國主義者的租界！那末或者也許慮到糧食斷絶嗎？不然。他們早就曉得上海的食米要靠安南，閘北儘管和敵人打仗，安南米却一樣進口，而他們自己也不會短少銀錢！可見得所謂「禍」者簡直是另外一件事！</p>
<p>這些男男女女都是從虹口或者南市這兩個區域裏面逃過來的，以關係而論，不是伯唐的親戚，就是伯唐的本家；以職業而論，不是小商人，就是住租界房子吃鄉下田租的小地主，籠統說來不外乎全是小資產階級而已。他們在平常日子，已經把伯唐當作一個緩急相依的靠山，現在旣然在患難之中，承伯唐夫婦慨當以慷地解食推衣，所以自然要給伯唐夫婦分憂共樂。這天早上，他們從佩萸口裏，聽見了所謂廠裏的風聲，佩萸口裏的空中樓閣，固然不過是</p>
<p>相當地高，而到了他們的耳朶裏，却又湧出了更高的輪廓，所以他們竟以爲這座靠山或許就這樣受到動搖了，因此他們無論從禮貌上或者從實致上，都不能不表示一種靜默。然而在實際上，伯唐對於所謂風聲，是不甚視爲可怕的，而佩萸却視爲可怕；佩萸固然視爲可怕，而這些男男女女，又竟更進一層視爲一種恐怖了，所以他們在上午五六個鐘頭之内，没有聽見廠裏的消息，以及工人代表的和張之光的行踪，就都認爲事件的嚴重越壓越緊而認爲祻在眉睫。</p>
<p>這樣一逕等到四點鐘光景，始終是杳無消息，其間有好幾次，電話的鈴子偶爾一响，就看見佩萸匆匆忙忙奔到話機跟前去，在她說了兩三句之後，才是從容緩步的伯唐踱過來，而結果却不是問題之内的對話。所以從八點多鐘鬧到下午，局面並没有甚麽進步。四點鐘到了，忽然郵差接連送了兩封快信來。</p>
<p>第一封信是壽子春寄的，拆開一看，才曉得是一份請帖，請伯唐明天午后六時到他家裏吃飯。伯唐看過隨手向桌上一扔，佩萸像是不平似地使勁說道：</p>
<p>『這樣的時世還要發快信請客，這個人眞也是麻木了！伯唐，你可以不必去······』</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>獨身俱樂部</h3>
<p>— 亮</p>
<p>昨據某報倫敦訊，英國巴金茹姆歇縣之海威科姆市，有靑年百餘名，組一獨身俱樂部，會員須具有孤獨的性格，且立有戒條，最近有一敵對之團體出現，係該市浪漫女子所組織，專事誘惑該會會員，此外另有一部分女子散發反對傳單，抨擊該俱樂部，</p>
<p>通訊所載，大略如是，該俱樂部組織的動機，我却不得而知，惟據我個人所猜測，不外二義，㈠英國！不但英國丨經濟的不景氣，失業者的增加，個人生活，較易解决，㈡因爲近年女子驕奢淫逸，放浪不覊，男子供給，益增痛苦，而道德方面，更不可靠，我想組織該俱樂部的動機，無非如是，</p>
<p>若我的觀察不差，則女子反對的理由，亦不難想象，其理由是㈠若男子斷</p>
<p>絶經濟上的補助，則女子不能盡情揮霍，縱欲無度，㈡浪漫女子，原以男子爲玩物，若男子主張獨身，不給她們玩弄，則浪漫女子必感到枯寂無聊，不能實行其浪漫生活，其所以欲破壞該俱樂部的意義，想亦不過如此，</p>
<p>中國人的口頭禪，往往說女子爲男子的玩物，其實這句說話，本來不對，孟老夫子說，食色性也，這個性，原應該賅男女而言，本來男子有性，難道女子没有性麽？若云玩物而論，男子以女子爲玩物，女子以男子爲玩物，玩來玩去，本來不成問題，不過從前制度，約束男子較寛，約束女子較嚴，故女子的性，不許她飛揚跋巵，枉作枉爲，所以女子的性不易見，而只見男子的性，現在反了，女子的性，不是赤裸裸都表演出來麽，怎樣表演，我可不必說，且看，不必到舞塲新戲院裏去看，就到馬路上去看。</p>
<p>不過現在我國的男子，尙没有組織獨身俱樂部出現，因爲我國的職業問題，經濟問題，雖已到山窮水盡的時候，然而大家庭制度，尙未完全打破，并有幾位老前輩，還是以子女婚嫁問題，認爲是做父母惟一的天職，所以一切負擔，均由家長任之，牛馬做得十分道地，而在靑年呢？旣没有感到家庭的痛苦，又没有受着了女的負擔，所以還在拚命地追求，拚命地講戀愛，我想覺悟時期，終究不遠要到了。</p>

<h3>無奇不有</h3>
<p>— 奔</p>
<p>上海之大，無奇不有，因爲無奇不有，於是乎上海越益大了。這是現社會的畸形，畸形都市的必然傾向。</p>
<p>前日報載，昨晚捕房華副捕頭陸大公値差該園，忽有一衣冠楚楚之靑年男子，尾隨至黑暗處，出示卡片，上書戴雲芳，陸詢其何爲，答稱</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>爲先擠游藝塲旦角，因生活艱難，流爲男妓，詢以夜度資幾許，則答八元，並請陸至其家，陸即將其逮捕云，</p>
<p>此果希天下之大奇者矣，方之客歲某大旅館扮演的人犬交媾奇觀，差可媲美，亦爲光輝上海文明史之一葉。</p>
<p>人類是「求生」的動物，社會旣然如此，没有事做，没有飯吃，使他不能正則的「生」，便只有走向歪曲的歧途，因此盜，賊，綁匪，賣淫等等的人物，便顯現於社會了，而且天天在增多，這樣，戴雲芳之流爲男妓，實有不得已的社會性的苦衷，生活迫害他如此，何等悲傷，問題又何等嚴重。</p>
<p>其次應說到畸形大都市的罪惡，虚榮，享樂的迷網，罩住了某個人的心，惡劣的環境，無時無處不帶引你向歧途走，燈紅酒綠，肉慾横流，有幾個禁得住他的誘惑，而豪富之流，感於「生」的平庸，更醉心於新奇的剌激，因此嗎啡紅丸鴉片神女等等乃遂昌盛，男妓不能謂非是富於新剌激的一種玩意兒，所以戴雲芳便出而幹這一套，若果臉袋縹緻，行使得法，未始不可奇貨高售，贏得生活舒舒服服。</p>
<p>不過據戴雲芳自供，旣在先施樂園有職，想來尙可維持起碼生活，不若全無投靠的貧漢，似此而竟甘蹈此下流，也眞是一個最没出息的人了，可憐尤復可憎。</p>
<p>總之，這現象不是偶然的，也就不希奇，乃是現社會上的病態序幕，畸形都市裏難免的勾當。若果整個社會没有出路，這類事件，在上海，不但不會息跡隠聲，而且會日見其多，而且會蔓延各地。</p>
<h3>學堂生活素描</h3>

<p>是一個深秋的晚上。</p>
<p>「我本是········」</p>
<p>「妹妹我愛你··········」</p>
<p>「咦阿···········咦阿」</p>
<p>「Oh　good　form」</p>
<p>各種不同的聲調，從電炬輝煌照得全室如白晝的宿舍。</p>
<p>「花和尙宿舍裏今晚怎的這樣鬧？」</p>
<p>固步自封，因之被稱爲烈女的Ｑ，聽到這樣不安寗的聲調，雖則無意領略，終亦不耐煩的發問了。</p>
<p>「他們在開緊急會議呢！」善管閒事的Ｙ，最會打聽别人的事，今天當然不會例外，所以他就效毛遂的自薦來答復了。其實Ｑ並非問他。</p>
<p>「甚事？」Ｑ就直認他問。</p>
<p>「明日要和縣中比賽足球。你曉得嗎？他們正在商量作戰機宜。我剛在他們門縫中看見花和尙還在ＳＰ的身上嘖的一來呢！金冬瓜因爲派不着好職位，賭氣跑掉，明天恐怕還要賽不成，聽說許臘子丨丨體育主任兼訓育員丨來點名的時候，花和尙眼眼調給他撞見，因爲他也曾給花和尙發覺過他的秘密，所以祇不過露出一絲心照的微笑並没打官話。Ｙ，因爲你是烈女，還有更笑話的事情，不便向你直談啊！」Ｙ若有所持的說着。</p>
<p>「偷糞老鼠！你壞！你賣關子！」</p>
<p>Ｙ正在權衡輕重陳說利害的當兒。一般好聽新聞的朋友，由相距十三個宿舍之遠的地方集中到這裏等了半天聽不</p>
<p>出眉目，急得不約而同的憔噪起來。</p>
<p>Ｙ本想再賣一個關子。却給一個劈頭的巨靈之掌嚇住了！</p>
<p>「吃過夜飯我行經洗浴室門前，聽見裏面有人談笑。以爲那個。仔細一聽，原來是花和尙向ＳＰ要求呢！說「從前你推說天氣熱不答應，現在可没甚推啦！」ＳＰ扭妮地坦白的回他一句「且看明天比賽的結局。」土地菩薩。你想！明天花和尙是要如何的拚命去爭得粉紅色的」夜啊！唐僧！你怎麽也在聽嗎？你回頭看看烈女的臉色吧！」</p>

<h3>都市的一角</h3>
<p>— 爾礎</p>
<p>繁囂的都市，處處潛伏着猙獰的可畏；這種内者的眞實狀態的展露，是充分的表現出都市的不景氣！</p>
<p>在都市的某一角，便是「窠」的所在。「窠裏生活」在一般過慣的人看來，彷彿和「家」站在一條水平線上，没甚希罕。但在另一方面觀察，則也免不了帶些神秘的色彩。總之「窠」是一種不規則的組織。窠裏生活所給予我們的印象是，驚駭丨</p>
<p>「上窠務需登高」。這幾乎是一個定理。而且上窠的路徑，必定是異常曲折的。比如：一個弄裏的窠，當然是從後門進出的，那一乘寛約尺餘的扶梯，眞夠使你受累，而且還蜒蜿曲折，大有走邑廟九曲橋之風味，加之黑暗無光，雖白晝也要使你摸不着門徑。</p>
<p>第一步，走進窠，首先使你感到的，便是一陣莫名其妙的臭味。（也許窠客們是以爲香味的）繼是一股繚繞的烟霧，籠罩了整個的窠，猶似放了一個烟幕彈。在這迷茫中却躺着許多似獵人般的「窠客」，每個人都用心在燈頭上做工夫。</p>
<p>一榻横陳，萬愁具消，把世間一切煩惱，在這裏盞黄豆大的燈上，盡燒得一乾二凈，可憐結果：形容枯槁，面色憔悴，臘般的臉，紙般的唇，眞是可驚</p>
<p>可駭，不可嚮爾。</p>
<p>在這「仙窠」裏，貤偶而有「仙女」的光降，調濟了不少香火因緣。她們横在榻上，舒臂輕挑，脫手成珠，豈不妙乎丨所麻烦的事後不免要重施一次粉飾罷了。</p>
<p>嗚呼！神秘哉！窠裏生活！</p>

<h3>十五歲的小販</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個小學五年級就輟學的學生，同時又是一個孤苦無依者；父親於一二八淞滬之役，慘遭炸斃。我和母親及五歲幼弟，雖經逃出戰區，但是日則告貸羣衆，夜則露宿風棲。此種非人生活畢竟難以久持。嗣後從事小販，兼售夜報，藉獲微利，以資度日。奈邇來生意淸淡，終日所獲，僅足以供一已。致母親時受飢餓，追憶往昔身世，悲憤交集，屢欲輕生。蓋我之家境，本可支撑，徒慘遭國難，頃刻間變爲赤貧。苟吾母自殺，則幼弟勢將流離，或爲匪徒所拐賣。每念及此，輙哭不成聲。茲欲打消我母厭世之念計，並爲幼弟覓一教養之所計，特地懇求編輯先生，曁貴同人指導。希介紹一慈善機關，（如中華慈幼恊會，淞滬紀念廣慈院，中國婦孺救濟會，或其他教會團體等）收容教養。家母（現年三十五歲）則請求同在一處，充作傭婦，工資不計，祗求膳宿二項有着，母子相依爲命，度過難關，一俟我年齡稍長，（我今十五歲）謀生能力增進時，自當負充分瞻養之責。素仰先生等關懷社會疾苦，尤其是貧民窟中之呼籲；時予以應聲，今茲我家之事，即是貧民窟中呼籲無門者之一。懇求先生等予以救濟特此敬請</p>
<p>撰安　　　　汪長祿鞠躬</p>
<p>編者按：汪君今年才十五歲，不要說他要是生在富厚人家，即使在衣食勉强可以過去的人家，怕不是還在「不知天高地厚」的黄金時代嗎現在他因爲生在貧苦人家，自食其力了這不夠，他還要爲了母親和弟弟而悲哀。我們常常聽到人說：「人是應當生而平等的」，在這種塲合裏，又怎樣講呢。汪君現在的困苦，絶對不是他自取的；或者他已經比了任何一個同樣年齡的人更努力！人類的同情心，倘使還有些存在在這世界的話，像汪君這一類的人，應當第一個受人帮助。他現在所希望的是出賣他母親的勞力，並不想白叨人家的光，思想更是可敬。世有要買這種勞力的人嗎？爲什麽竟没有注意到他呢？他還希望慈善機關，把他的幼弟搭救。經辦慈善事業的人，放著這種人不救，我眞不曉得他們救的是怎樣一類人？所以我們特地將汪君的信，在此公佈；希望原來要買進勞力，和原來在辦慈善事業的人士，能夠知道人世門還有這樣一家幾口，正等着沐你們的深恩。倘有信件，本欄極原代達。不過汪君還希望他母親，能與他的弟弟在一起，這一點當然不能說他是不應有的希冀，不顧萬一辦不到的時候，只好放棄。要曉得一個求人帮忙的人，當然非在萬不得已時，最好不要附帶條件。</p>

<h3>紅綠燈下（二十四）</h3>
<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>『他在家嗎？可以請他來坐坐！』他裝着不關心似的說，</p>
<p>『他忙啦，這可不曉得！』三姨太簡直以李石喬奇貨自居了。</p>
<p>『剛回來呢，我去請好罷！』阿珍之搶着去喊石喬，不僅在想討好于介夫而已，她等不及回答便自去了。</p>
<p>這裏，介夫在盤算着怎樣不失身份的一番話。</p>
<p>一會，敲門進來的却是兩個人，後面跟進來的便是王化矮子。楊介夫正預備一種歡迎的表情，看着王矮子丨不識者冒然的闖入，便心裏老大不舒服。更不幸者，這矮子一走進來居然滿面笑容的向他伸出手道：</p>
<p>『啊呀，楊先生，楊先生，久違教言了！一向好嗎？』</p>
<p>『楊先生』祇好卦上半面笑容，另一過面孔滿浮着遲疑的神色。手勉强讓矮子握着搖了幾搖·王化並不因此覺到無趣，一貫熱烈的說下去：</p>
<p>『楊先生，我們差不多半年不見了！那時候，是去年九一八以後吧，我記得楊先生在國貨展覽會那一篇演說眞是沉痛極了，提倡國貨眞是救國的根本辦法！』</p>
<p>這一下把介夫提醒了起來，原來在國貨展覽會塲中曾經交換過一次名片，但姓什麽他也忘記了，只記得這矮子好像是什麽第七黨部的代表。慣於交際塲的楊介夫雖不知道這矮子的姓名，却也不便問『請教尊姓！』祗得，</p>
<p>『那裏，那裏！』的歉虚了幾聲。李石喬也看出形勢不對，趕着給他們巧妙的介紹道：</p>
<p>『這位王化先生和我是老同學，最近發起ＸＸＸＸ團體聯合會，王先生也是主要份子！特來拜望楊先生的！』</p>
<p>『啊丨她，原來如此，王先生難得！』楊介夫的機警當然也不會亞於王化，他說：凑巧，凑巧，我剛才看到你們貴會的通電，聯絡到有多個團體，眞不容易！這時候，靠我們大家共起呼喊，終可以打敗日本人的，那麽·····貴會的計劃一定很好的！』</p>
<p>『那裏，那裏，這靠楊先生提携提携！』王化回頭看到三姨太，想說話，但只笑着點點頭·因爲他一時來不及分析喊密司李好，還是喊楊太太好。</p>
<p>於是，大家分賓主坐下。不免找着天氣凉暖的話寒喧了幾句。楊介夫漸漸把話頭拖到他想說的地方。</p>
<p>···王先生的話甚是！上海地方太複雜了，組織救國團體總要正當的人負責才行。我看到好多，常借檢查日貨向商家敲竹槓，這那裏成樣子，譬如········」</p>
<p>『㚥商也實在太多了！』熱血的李石喬對於這些話題總不讓輕輕的放過，他認眞的接着說：『據我看，倒不怕他們向商家敲竹桿，只怕他們這般東西容易受㚥商的賄賂。所以，我們最要緊的是肅淸這種假愛國的賣國賊！』</p>

<h3>Yellow River Separates, Letter from Huang, Encouraging Feng to Send Representatives to Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>Deng Zhexi, Li Xin, and Others All Wrote to Feng, Urging Him Not to Be Stubborn</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Chahar situation is currently at a standstill. The North China authorities are following the Central Government's predetermined steps and actively preparing. They also hope that Feng will quickly abolish the name of the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army. It is planned to formally advise Feng in the name of the Political Reorganization Committee within a few days, urging him to come to his senses. If this is ineffective, a new path will be explored. Meng Xianzhang reported the negotiation situation to Feng via telegram after speaking with Huang Fu and Song Zheyuan yesterday. The prospects for peace in Chahar Province are not optimistic. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng's representatives, Deng Zhexi, Li Xin, and others, arrived in Beiping from Tianjin last night. They have a clear understanding of the established method adopted here to resolve the Chahar situation. They all plan to go to Zhangjiakou to persuade Feng not to be stubborn. However, Feng's telegram to Beiping on the 8th showed a very firm intention, which was very difficult at the time. After consultation, it was decided to draft letters separately, asking Feng to set a direction as soon as possible and issue a circular telegram to abolish the name of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. At the same time, Feng's secretary sent to Beiping, Chen Houci, also met with Song and others. Song still asked Chen to return to Zhangjiakou as soon as possible to persuade him. This morning, Huang Shu sent a personal letter. The general idea of Huang's letter was still to hope that Feng would adopt and implement the four items he had set, otherwise, he would be powerless, about three hundred words. The main points of Song's letter roughly stated: Sir, you hope that I will return to Chahar. There are various difficulties why I cannot return to Chahar. If you truly love me, sir, I hope you will quickly issue a circular telegram to abolish the Anti-Japanese Army, open up the thorny path and move towards a smooth path, pull back from the precipice, I only hope for this for Chahar, etc. Deng Zhexi, Li Xin, Meng Xianzhang, and others all drafted letters to persuade him based on the situation here, and handed them to Chen to take back to Zhangjiakou. Chen left Beiping at 4 pm this afternoon to go to Zhangjiakou. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Huang Fu expressed his four opinions on Chahar to Meng Xianzhang yesterday, Meng immediately relayed them by telegram. This afternoon, he received a reply telegram from Feng, roughly saying that the Anti-Japanese Army is now in battle near Dolon, and the recovery of Dolon can be expected. The four measures proposed by the Beiping side will not be a problem if Dolon is captured, and please inform all parties. Meng will relay Feng's telegram to all parties. It is heard that the Beiping side hopes that Feng will immediately issue a circular telegram to end the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, and everything can be solved easily. The Military Affairs Committee's routine meeting on the 12th may have a final decision on the Chahar issue. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Hope for Peace in Chahar is Very Slim</h3>
<p>(Beiping) People are still traveling between Zhangjiakou and Beiping for peace negotiations these days, but in reality, the hope for peace is very slim. In the future, after Sun's troops' defense areas can be replaced by the designated troops of the authorities, the Chahar situation will move towards an effective solution, but it cannot be completely optimistic immediately. It is heard that the authorities will appoint Pang as the chairman after the Chahar situation is resolved. Huang Fu is scheduled to write a letter to Feng on the 16th, making a final persuasion, urging him to come to his senses. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Pang Bingxun Will Be Appointed Chairman of Chahar</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun, who has been most active in mediating the Chahar issue, is quite passive because he cannot proceed. After Pang's troops arrive in Chahar, a new path may be opened. In the future, the Chahar Provincial Government will definitely be reorganized, with Pang as the chairman. Pang said at the station that his army was ordered by the Military Affairs Committee to take over the defense of Huailai. He himself went to Kangzhuang first, and the military headquarters was temporarily located there. He did not want to express opinions on the Chahar issue. He only obeyed the government's orders. After the troops are deployed, he will return to Beiping within a few days. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan is quite indifferent to the position of Chairman of Chahar. In recent days, the voice of Pang as the chairman has been high again. Qin Dechun went to Guanyintang this morning to review the troops on behalf of Song and gave a speech to the officers and soldiers. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Pang's Troops Take Over the Defense of Huailai and Vicinity</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's troops are preparing everything while waiting for trains and pay. Due to the busy transportation of demobilized troops on the Ping Sui Railway, only two military trains were allocated to Sun's troops, which were not enough for deployment. Therefore, the infantry in the Huailai area have successively marched on foot and have been taken over by Pang's troops.

<p>Xue Zhiheng Goes to Tangshan to Make Final Contact with Li Jichun</p>
<h3>Reorganize the Puppet Army Within a Time Limit, Then Take Over the Administration of Various Counties</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Reception War Zone Committee did not hold a meeting on the 11th because the members had not arrived. Tao Shangming and Li Zeyi will come to Tianjin from Beiping, and the meeting will be held in the provincial government on the morning of the 12th. Xue Zhiheng will take the evening train to Tangshan to make a final connection with Li Jichun. Li's troops will be reorganized by us, 4,000 people will be compiled as police, and the rest will be sent back to their hometowns with funds, 20 yuan per soldier, 50 yuan per officer. The surplus military equipment will be purchased by us, 20 yuan for each rifle, 50 yuan for each pistol. Li's title is quite difficult to consider. It is planned to give him a position in the Beiping Military Affairs Committee in the future. It is scheduled to start the reorganization from the 15th and complete it before the 25th, and then take over the administration of various counties. Shi Yousan established a military cadre school in Qinhuangdao with 1,500 students. Shi's plan is to purchase 50,000 rifles from Japan at half price, and after the students graduate from training, he will train 50,000 people in Luandong or Guanwai. It is a pity that Shi was not mentioned at this Dalian meeting. There are still difficulties in opening the Beining Railway to Tangshan and Yuguan. After Li's troops are resolved, the first step is to open to Luanzhou, and the second step is to open to Beidaihe. If you want to get to Yuguan, I am afraid that you have to establish joint transportation with the puppet Fengshan Road. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Welcome to the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Generals</h3>
<p>Recently, Generals Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, Li Du, and others have returned from overseas and gathered in Shanghai. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Volunteer Army Support Association, and other organizations, recognizing the generals' arduous fight against Japan and their efforts for the nation, although the cause failed, their contributions are still worth remembering, have specially organized a joint meeting today to welcome them. When the generals led the volunteer army in the Northeast to resist the enemy, various groups in Shanghai raised substantial funds and sent them to support them. There was a connection between the two sides. However, more than half a year ago, each did their part and helped each other, hoping to achieve the common goal of saving the country and resisting foreign aggression. Unexpectedly, it has come to this day. Those who are holding this welcome meeting cannot help but be a group of people who are saddened and indignant due to the armistice in North China. The welcomed have also become failed heroes. Reminiscing about the past, examining the current situation, how can we not sigh?</p>
<p>Today's welcome meeting allows the participants to listen to the patriotic soldiers' accounts of their battles and express their grand views. The generals can also use this opportunity to have practical contact with patriotic groups in Shanghai. This must be recognized as a meaningful event. And we take this opportunity to express our views to contribute to the generals, which is also our fortune.</p>
<p>What we expect from the generals, first, is to continue their efforts to fulfill their original intention of resisting Japan. Although the generals were forced by the enemy to leave their subordinates, there are still more than 10,000 Northeastern anti-Japanese soldiers who have moved to Chahar. The number of those who have entered Xinjiang from Russia is also close to 10,000. Those who are scattered in the Northeast and have not changed their anti-Japanese sentiments, are even more countless. These are all veterans who have never forgotten their national hatred. How will the generals lead these troops in the future to work for the country? Lost territory has not been recovered, and national hatred has not been avenged. The generals and their troops have much to do in the future. Second, establish a model for patriotic soldiers to change the atmosphere of the military circles in the country. In the winter of the twentieth year, after reading the battle report of the Nenjiang battle, the soldiers in the country who were brave in internal warfare felt ashamed. The people in various places rose up and worked hard. Although few ruined their families to help the country, many enthusiastically made donations. Subsequently, various armies rose up to resist the enemy, giving military and social figures moral stimulation. Now that the generals have returned via Europe, what they have seen and heard must be helpful to their self-cultivation and can be used as a model for the military in the country. How can they increase their personality and change the atmosphere of the military circles in the country?</p>
<p>At present, the generals are in a difficult situation, but their status in the hearts of the people is very good. Although the previous war against Japan ended in failure, the people's respect and sympathy have not diminished. Today's welcome is a sincere expression of the people's feelings for patriotic soldiers. I hope that the generals will live up to the expectations of the people in the future and achieve their achievements. I will mention two points to replace the words of welcome.</p>
<p>The right-wing group Production Party and the Patriotic Labor Party joined forces, attempting to take advantage of the cabinet meeting to wipe out the party and government giants in one fell swoop.</p>
<h3>The plot was leaked, and hundreds were arrested.</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The right-wing group Production Party, headed by right-wing tycoon Ryohei Uchida, conspired with the Patriotic Labor Party to assassinate key figures in the central political circles. They summoned party members from all over the country to Tokyo and Osaka, and planned to carry out a riot today to assassinate Prime Minister Saito, Interior Minister Yamamoto, and Chief Secretary to the Emperor Makino, as well as the presidents of the two political parties, Seiyukai and Minseito. Many party members had already arrived in Tokyo from various places and stayed at the Aoyama Youth Hall last night. Due to the leakage of the plan, the Metropolitan Police Department detected it. At 8:00 this morning, they took action to arrest them with swift and thunderous means. They surrounded the headquarters of the Production Party in Akasaka Tameike. By 9:00 a.m., hundreds of people had been arrested at the headquarters and other locations. Although the party leader, Ryohei Uchida, was still safe, Suzuki Zenichi, a senior member of the party, was also arrested. It is reported that the party's plan was to absorb members of the Blood Pledge Corps and take various actions against the center of the political and financial circles. The Metropolitan Police Department had already heard about this, so the arrest this morning was very swift. The party also had a similar plan in Osaka. The Osaka police were on alert at the banks and arrested party members. By 10:00 a.m., 50 people had been arrested. (Eleventh dispatch from the Electric Communications Society)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the military police discovered a major conspiracy case and arrested several people, the residences of cabinet members and other important figures have been heavily guarded by military police since last night. The British Embassy is also among them. The people arrested were captured in Ibaraki Prefecture. The conspiracy case of May 15th last year and the assassination of Finance Minister Inoue of the Yamamoto Cabinet originated in this area. (Eleventh dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The motive for the Production Party's attempted incident was to reverse the fatal failure of the London Treaty, which was due to expire in 1936, and to seek the enrichment of national defense. The order to summon party members today was issued on the 7th, with the entrance to Meiji Jingu Shrine on the Omotesando as the gathering place. By 3:00 a.m. this morning, 40 people had been arrested there. (Eleventh dispatch from the Electric Communications Society)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Metropolitan Police Department heard that Suzuki Zenichi of the Japan Production Party had issued an order to summon members of the party to pray for national defense at Meiji Jingu Shrine. At the same time, they learned about rumors of disrupting the capital, assassinating the Minister of the Army, and attacking financial giants. They jointly guarded the area with the military police. On the evening of the 10th, they discovered a secret meeting of more than 50 members of the Production Party and immediately dispatched a police team to arrest Suzuki and nine leaders. When they were arrested, the Prime Minister's official residence and the official residences of the ministers were heavily guarded. (Eleventh dispatch from Japan United Press)</p>
<h3>The Minister of the Navy fully shielded them.</h3>
<p>He did not believe there was an unstable plan.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The conspiracy of the Japan Production Party became an issue at today's cabinet meeting. When Interior Minister Yamamoto reported, the ministers questioned the content and extent of the conspiracy. Minister of the Navy Osumi and Minister of Justice Oyama explained that according to the investigation by the Navy and Justice authorities, the case was completely a rumor. The Production Party is a right-wing group and has no conspiracy plans. They only held a prayer meeting at Meiji Jingu Shrine today. (Eleventh dispatch from Japan United Press)</p>
<h3>Insufficient evidence of assassination</h3>
<p>Forty people released</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Suzuki Zenichi and other leaders of the Production Party arrested by the police are currently being investigated by the chief of the Special Higher Police. Because they were not carrying weapons, it could not be proven that they had an unstable plan. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Fujinuma, and the Chief of the Special Higher Police, Abe, discussed the handling of the matter and decided to temporarily detain Suzuki and the other nine people for further investigation, and release all 40 people who participated from various places.

<p>(1) A Trade and Commerce Committee will be established jointly by officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs to control imports and exports and coordinate the development of foreign trade and commerce. (2) The above-mentioned committee will investigate and deliberate on the following matters and formulate specific plans: (A) What are the necessary measures to implement small marketism in parallel with the current large marketism? (B) Do not focus on the export trade of mass production, and strive for the development of miscellaneous goods exports. (C) Abolish the principle of transit or indirect transactions, and adopt the principle of direct transactions. (D) Implement small marketism and seek to open up new markets in the Near East, East Africa, South Africa, the South Seas, and Siam. (3) For the purpose of exercising the aforementioned purposes, it is necessary to establish new unexploited bureaus or sections within the ministry. (4) Seek effective and appropriate measures to improve the effectiveness of the current export compensation law. (5) Establish 43 new consulates and commercial officers overseas to open up the aforementioned new markets and to seek the convenience of merchants from their own country. (6) Regarding the new tariff policy, improve the current single system and implement the highest rate and the lowest rate for treaty countries and non-treaty countries, respectively. (7) Establish a proportional system as a measure to withdraw from the import and export restriction treaty. (8) The effective period of the current commercial navigation treaties between Japan and the powers has largely expired. When revising the new treaties, the principle of exchanging most-favored-nation treatment between the two parties should be taken as a prerequisite, and the principle of reciprocal tax rates should be adopted to negotiate with the governments of the countries concerned.

<h3>Sino-Russian Negotiations on the Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Moscow's instructions have arrived in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The future is not yet optimistic.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the Sino-Russian meeting on the Chinese Eastern Railway was suspended, the Russian representative requested instructions from the Moscow government. The reply arrived in Tokyo on the 10th. The Russian representative immediately notified the representatives of the puppet Manchukuo delegation on the 11th that a meeting was scheduled to be held at 2:30 p.m. on the 12th. The Russian side received instructions from the Moscow government, which were kept secret. However, according to the Russian representative's statement, the Russian side's current policy is as follows: (1) The negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway should continue in good faith between the two parties. (2) The Russian side requests ownership of the railway. (3) The issue of the railway price will be discussed with the representatives of the puppet state again. From this point of view, the meeting can be maintained temporarily. However, because the puppet state does not recognize Russian ownership, the prospects for a satisfactory outcome are being watched. (Eleventh dispatch from Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Soviet Russian representative Kozlovsky notified the puppet state representative Ohashi by telephone this afternoon that the meeting on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway will be resumed at 2:00 p.m. on the 14th. (Eleventh dispatch from Japan United Press)</p>
<h3>Japan decides to protest to Russia over the detention of Japanese fishing boats.</h3>
<p>Intending to take the opportunity to demand landing rights.</p>
<p>Russian perpetrators of the shooting of Japanese fishermen arrested</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry received a report that the Japanese fishing boat Kotohira Maru had been detained by Russia, it immediately sent the surveillance ship Kinmaru to investigate the truth. After the report arrives, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to submit a protest to the Russian government immediately. (Eleventh dispatch from Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This Soviet Russian act is a retaliatory act against the intrusion of two Japanese ships into Japanese territorial waters off the Kuril Islands the other day, which were towed to the root stone by Japan. In order to prevent such incidents from occurring frequently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to take this opportunity to request landing rights from the Soviet Russian government for personnel from Japanese destroyers and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry surveillance ships, who have not been able to land on Russian territory in the past.

<h3>Japan Overhauls War Preparations</h3>
<p>Navy Budget Actively Expanded</p>
<p>Shipbuilding costs break through 500 million yuan</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Navy's second supplementary plan was drafted by the Naval General Staff, and was only completed yesterday. The general outline of the Naval General Staff's plan is as follows: (1) Two light cruisers of 8,500 tons class, requiring an expenditure of 61.2 million yuan, with a construction cost of 3,600 yuan per ton. However, this is based on the London Naval Treaty and cannot be built until 1936. (1) Two aircraft carriers of 10,000 tons class, with an expenditure of 84 million yuan, with a construction cost of 4,200 yuan per ton. According to the Washington and London Treaties, the aircraft carrier's replenishable construction volume is 12,000 tons. Adding the Daikans of Hosho makes it 20,000 tons. (1) 14 destroyers of 1,400 tons class, with an expenditure of 90.48 million yuan, with a construction cost of 4,800 yuan per ton. However, only six of them will be completed by the end of 1936. (1) Six submarines, with a total tonnage limit of 7,500 tons, building six large and small, with an expenditure of 40.5 million yuan, with a construction cost of 5,400 yuan per ton. (1) One minelayer of 5,000 tons class, with an expenditure of 12 million yuan,</p>
<h3>Vessels outside the Limit</h3>
<p>(1) Torpedo boat and other expenses of 50 million yuan, (1) The cost of adding eight air squadrons is 160 million yuan, totaling 517.8 million yuan. This second supplementary plan is intended to build the entire allowable volume of the London Treaty. It is not yet known whether it will be amended or reduced after consultation with the Ministry of the Navy and the budget assessment of the Ministry of Finance. However, the full amount has actually broken through the large supplementary plan of 500 million. It has not been decided whether this plan will be a continuous undertaking until the 12th year of Showa, or will be completed in the 11th fiscal year. However, the Navy plans to request at least 120 million yuan in the 9th fiscal year budget. (Eleventh dispatch from the Electric Communications Society)</p>

<h3>Disputes Arise Over Insurance for American Cotton and Wheat Shipments to China</h3>
<p>(Washington) A dispute has suddenly arisen over the insurance issue for the 50 million yuan cotton and wheat shipment to China, involving the Finance Rehabilitation Corporation, further complicating the negotiation of the loan details. The Chinese side is concerned that this dispute will hinder the purchase and shipment of cotton and wheat. However, Finance Rehabilitation Corporation personnel said that the matter is expected to be resolved soon, and the entire loan procedure is expected to be agreed upon in a relatively short period of time. The cause of the matter is that the Chinese government agreed to insure with American Asia Insurance Company, American Insurance Company, and Insurance Company of North America at the beginning of the month. However, various cotton insurance companies in the United States, represented by Speyer Collins Company, are competing for the contract, putting pressure on the Finance Rehabilitation Corporation, demanding that the Chinese government cancel the original contracts with American Asia and others, and arguing that since this loan is borne by the Finance Rehabilitation Corporation, the insurance should naturally be borne by purely American companies. According to news from New York, the demands of Speyer Collins Company have slightly delayed the negotiation of the loan details. The Chinese side is concerned that cotton prices will rise, causing losses. However, Finance Rehabilitation Corporation personnel said that this dispute is not difficult to resolve, and countless details regarding insurance, transportation, and delivery of cotton and wheat are waiting for detailed agreement. Considering the complexity of this matter, we are confident that we are making satisfactory progress. It is also said that the company is currently considering the proposal of disbursing the loan through the Federal Reserve Board. The insurance dispute is unlikely to be resolved in a few days. However, whether it is insured by American companies in China or domestic American insurance companies, there is actually no difference. However, if the original contracts between the Chinese government and American Asia and others are cancelled, a completely new method may be negotiated.

<h3>Rumors of a Large Sino-British Loan Recently</h3>
<p>There are two theories: cash and credit.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Not long after Finance Minister T.V. Soong secured a loan from the United States, various newspapers have recently reported that he will continue to borrow from the United Kingdom. All parties are paying close attention to this. According to Nisshin Shimbun's reliable sources, it seems that this Sino-British loan has become a reality. The amount is 5 million pounds, which is about half of the American loan. The nature of the loan is not to purchase goods from the UK, but to pay in cash. Few people knew about it in advance. According to officials, the loan is intended to be used specifically for important construction needs in the future. However, according to British sources, the loan has not been made public, and the British government has not been consulted. Thirteen large companies are jointly selling machinery and other items to China. T.V. Soong's representative went to negotiate. There is no cash, but rather a credit-like contract. Domestic factories can purchase machinery under this machinery. It is not for the use of the national government. Furthermore, a formal contract has not yet been signed. If all parties do not purchase, British companies can also abandon or postpone it. Because this machinery, if not sold on credit to China, will be sold on credit to the Soviet Union. There is no concern about excess in the UK. (Eleventh dispatch from Special Correspondent)</p>
<h3>Our Government Orders Destroyer Aircraft from the United States</h3>

<h3>French Newspapers Advocate a Franco-Japanese Alliance</h3>
<p>Oppressing Our Nation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Paris dispatch: French newspapers are divided into news and party newspapers. Among the news newspapers, Lefiraro is the most fiercely anti-Chinese newspaper. In February of this year, the newspaper published six articles on the theme of changes in the Asian situation. The general idea is that France's interests in the Far East are to maintain Annam. To maintain Annam, it is necessary to support the Qing dynasty, because the Qing dynasty is a foreign race and is concerned about Annam's belonging to France. Now, the Chinese Red bandits are rampant, the Southwest is independent, and it is in a state of chaos. Japan has made two major sacrifices in Manchuria, one is the 918 Incident, in which Shigeru Honjo avenged the murdered soldiers, and the other is the Tianjin Incident in the 20th year, which was instigated by Zhang Xueliang to harm Puyi. The independence of the puppet state is supported by Chinese and Mongolians, etc., and in a few years, it can be expanded to the Yellow River or the Yangtze River. This is because Japan makes good use of the deposed emperor, and France has the same will. Peeking at its intention, it seems to want to advocate that France unite with Japan, restore the Manchu Qing dynasty, to overwhelm our nation and maintain the barrier of Annam. It can be said that it is absurd. The editor of the newspaper is the owner of the famous cosmetics factory (Coty). The factory's perfumes and powders are sold in large quantities in our country. Our awakened nation should think about how to deal with it. (Eleventh dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Russian Negotiations Reopen</h3>
<p>▲Reuters London dispatch on the 10th: The Anglo-Russian negotiations on a new trade agreement, which broke down three months ago due to the arrest of British technicians in Russia, have resumed in London today. British Foreign Secretary Simon stated in the House of Commons that the British government intends to make it clear to Russia during the discussion that the negotiations on a permanent Anglo-Russian trade agreement must proceed simultaneously with the resolution of British demands. What the UK is demanding is the matter of property confiscated by Soviet Russia and debts it denies. The British government does not want to abandon this demand. Before a final resolution of such issues, any trade agreement can only be regarded as temporary.</p>
<h3>More than 100 Passengers and Crew of the Tunan Wheel Are Missing</h3>
<p>(Dalian) The Tunan ship collided with the Changchun Maru off the coast of Shandong yesterday morning and sank. There is now a great fear of loss of life. The Changchun Maru sailed into this port today with a huge hole in its port side. According to the latest count, only 89 people have been rescued. There are still 168 passengers and crew members whose whereabouts are unknown. The only foreigner on the Tunan ship was Mrs. Hribarcek, a 33-year-old Yugoslav woman. Today, she told a Reuters reporter in the hospital that she first climbed onto an overturned lifeboat, then switched to a floating door, and finally climbed onto the ladder of the Tunan ship, staying in the water for about 10 hours before being rescued. She saw a Chinese crew member with two lifebuoys. She tried to get one of them, but the crew member tried to hit her. She also said that the two ships collided in dense fog. She was exhausted when she was rescued by the Changchun Maru. (Twelfth dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<h3>The World Economic Conference Shows Signs of Clearing Up</h3>
<p>Principal Officers Adopt the Currency Drafting Committee's Proposals</p>
<p>To Allow Business to Continue Under a Smaller Program</p>
<p>The European Gold Standard Bloc Effectively Claims Victory</p>
<p>The Conference Will Recess in Two Weeks, and a Resurgence is Unlikely</p>
<p>(London) The World Economic Conference has entered its final act. The London negotiations, on which the world placed its hopes, are unexpectedly going to continue some of their work. In two weeks, or perhaps in the last week of this month, the conference will recess. Thus, while the conference has avoided an immediate end, it has also failed to truly revive. The efforts of Britain and the United States to keep the conference working as usual have failed. Gold standard countries have only conceded to discussing cooperation among central banks. Therefore, at this time, the only agreements likely to be concluded soon are those on silver and wheat. (Eleventh National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The Financial Drafting Committee of the World Economic Conference met today with equal participation from both gold and non-gold standard countries. As a result, the outlook has greatly cleared up. The drafting committee has decided to report to the principal officers at their meeting this afternoon that work can proceed immediately on issues such as cooperation among central banks in silver-producing countries and debt. If these proposals are adopted by the principal officers, the conference will proceed with this smaller program, without adjourning. The conference will reconvene when the designated date arrives, or when the principal officers believe that currency values have stabilized and that the full program can begin. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday, the presidium of the Economic Conference established a drafting committee to revise the agenda of the Currency Committee. The drafting committee met at 9:45 this morning and, after lengthy discussions, decided on a draft to be submitted to the presidium this afternoon. The draft will prioritize currency issues according to their importance. The issues deemed currently suitable for study are: 1) Debt issues; 2) Silver issues; 3) Central bank policy. The third item specifically concerns resolutions previously passed by the Sub-Committee on Fundamental Issues. In addition to the above three issues, any other issues included in the agenda must be decided unanimously before they can be discussed. (Eleventh Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The presidium of the Economic Conference passed the report of the drafting committee within the Currency Committee without debate. (Eleventh Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The impact of today's released report from the Financial Drafting Committee will allow the sub-committees on silver, central bank cooperation, and debt to continue their work. However, it is heard that the wording of this proposal will delegate the responsibility for deciding what can be discussed to the sub-committees themselves. Therefore, if sub-committees encounter disagreements, they can express their dissent and shelve the matters under discussion. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The drafting committee of the Currency Committee has reached a unanimous compromise on the future agenda of the committee. Problems that are relatively free of disputes, especially those unaffected by currency fluctuations, will be discussed first. It is anticipated that the Economic Conference will recess for the summer after these problems have consumed the next fourteen days.</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Currency Committee, Mr. Cox, told reporters that the sub-committees on fundamental and immediate issues will continue to work. According to the plan drafted by the drafting committee, the sub-committee on immediate issues will first discuss international commercial debt, while the sub-committee on fundamental issues will focus on the silver issue. The main committee will meet in the afternoon for ten minutes and pass the method drafted by the drafting committee, deciding that the sub-committee on fundamental issues, in addition to focusing on silver, should also discuss issues related to cooperation among central banks. In a broad sense, these issues can include the improvement of the gold standard, but it is generally believed that the gold standard group has achieved a complete victory because issues they did not want to discuss were not included. The methods drafted by the drafting committee are as follows:</p>
<p>The drafting committee suggests that: 1) The sub-committee on immediate currency issues should first discuss international commercial debt issues; 2) The sub-committee on fundamental currency issues should consider the resolutions that its members have already adopted, such as those concerning cooperation among central banks and the establishment of central banks in countries without them. It also suggests that the sub-committee continue to discuss the silver issue and other items on the agenda that the members agree can be discussed. (Eleventh National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Goods Exported to China Should Be Marked with the Country of Origin</h3>
<p>Our Representative Submits a Memorandum to the Conference</p>
<p>(London) The Chinese delegation submitted a memorandum to the Sub-Committee on Indirect Protectionist Policies of the Economic Conference, explaining the intention of the Chinese government's recently promulgated import regulations. These import regulations, which are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 1934, stipulate that all goods imported into China must be marked with the name of the country of origin in a readily identifiable location using the language of the importing country. The memorandum pointed out that goods imported into China from various countries often do not bear the marks of the original country of origin, which is a great inconvenience and a common complaint. "Our intention now is to use the simplest and most practical method to enable our country's consumers and users of goods to distinguish between domestic and foreign goods," the memorandum said. (Eleventh Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The Chinese delegation today submitted a memorandum to the committee of the World Economic Conference considering the issue of origin marking of goods, stating that any country can enable consumers to distinguish between domestic and foreign goods, and this national right cannot be taken away. The ordinance promulgated by China regarding the origin of goods, scheduled to be implemented in January 1934, is based on this intention. In terms of the ordinance itself and its application, what China wants is nothing more than to enable consumers to distinguish between domestic goods and foreign goods in a very simple way. The memorandum also stated that the Chinese delegation does not support the use of emblems in this matter. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Proposes to Include Items on the Agenda</h3>
<p>(London) Various parties are currently working hard to formulate the agenda of the World Economic Conference. The Soviet Union has also submitted a memorandum stating that, regardless of any decisions made regarding the scope of the conference agenda, the following issues should be included in the agenda: 1) An economic non-aggression pact; 2) The issue of expanding the possibility of imports by various countries, and the conditions under which such expansion is possible. The memorandum mentioned the possibility of increasing Soviet imports under certain circumstances. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Stabilization of Silver is Hopeful</h3>
<p>Eight Countries May Reach an Agreement</p>
<p>(London) The Silver Sub-Committee has progressed to a point where it is hopeful that an agreement on limiting silver sales by eight major countries can be reached tomorrow. It is reported that the three major silver-holding countries, China, Spain, and India, have agreed to limit their annual silver sales to no more than 40 to 50 million ounces in total. The five major silver-producing countries, the United States, Mexico, Canada, Peru, and Bolivia, will store excess silver from current production and annual production in their national treasuries. After this is implemented, it is expected that the price of silver will initially rise to between 40 and 50 US cents per ounce. After some excess production has been absorbed, it will not be difficult to rise to 60 US cents per ounce. Currently, there are about 10,000 US ounces of excess silver in the New York market that are only used for speculation. After it is absorbed and the annual sales volume is also limited, it will not be difficult to stabilize the price of silver. This agreement will be the first important result of the World Economic Conference, and the full text is expected to be released tomorrow. (Eleventh National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Wheat Production Restriction Plan</h3>
<p>Compromise Between Poland and Danube Countries</p>
<p>(London) An agreement has been reached between the Danube countries and Poland on the policy of reducing wheat production.

It is heard that some compromise may be reached today, and another meeting will be held tomorrow in order to agree on practical proposals put forward by consuming countries. It is rumored that Italy has expressed support for the experimental proposals of the producing countries, but the agreement of Germany, France, and Belgium may not be easy to obtain. Britain will not raise any serious objections. (Tenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Trade Policy Sub-Group Appointed a Drafting Committee</h3>
<p>(London) The Trade Policy Sub-Committee of the Economic Conference's Economic Committee met at 11 o'clock this morning. In accordance with the Presidium's decision, it appointed a special committee to be responsible for submitting a report on the question of continuing the work. At present, in the sub-committee, the delegations of eight countries have declared their support for stopping work, while the delegations of ten countries have declared their support for continuing work. After some discussion, the sub-committee elected a committee composed of representatives from Japan, Norway, Italy, the United States, France, Belgium, Britain, and Germany. The</p>
<p>committee will record the various viewpoints that have been stated by the various delegations. The duties of the drafting committee have been explained in detail by the British representative, Mr. Runciman, and the Dutch representative, Mr. Colijn, who said, "In order to prevent the results that have been obtained so far in the sub-committee's discussions from disappearing, we propose to establish a drafting committee that will be responsible for including the various differing opinions expressed in previous discussions in a report, so that this report can be used as the basis for discussion when this issue is studied again in the future." After the drafting committee was established, it immediately requested the Secretariat of the Economic Conference to compile the various viewpoints expressed by the delegations during the debate into a draft and submit it to the committee. The representatives of the United States and Norway intend to find a way to continue the debate, but the drafting committee, in accordance with the Presidium's views yesterday, has decided that discussions on fundamental monetary issues are currently impossible. (Eleventh Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Conference Is Watching Changes in the US Dollar</h3>
<p>(London) The World Economic Conference is currently watching the changes in the US dollar. The exchange rate of the US dollar is now close to its former parity with the British pound. Therefore, the principal officers do not want to make a hasty decision on whether the conference's work should continue. This wait-and-see policy is not surprising to observers. A week ago, French Finance Minister Bonnet predicted that the United States might be prepared to discuss the issue of currency stabilization within a week. This statement now seems slightly closer to the truth. A certain official from a gold standard country told a Reuters reporter that when the US dollar falls to the point where the US representatives can discuss stabilization, the gold standard countries will withdraw their opposition to the continuation of the conference. The representatives of the gold standard countries still insisted on the monetary issue today and did not participate in the Currency Committee meeting. (Tenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Containment of Speculation Has Been Effective</h3>
<p>(Paris) The efforts of gold standard countries to contain speculation have been remarkably effective. Although the US dollar has fallen, gold currencies remain strong. It is especially noteworthy that the currencies of the Netherlands and Switzerland, two gold standard countries that are more vulnerable to attack, have shown a strong recovery trend. (Tenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>British and French Authorities Explain Policies Towards the Economic Conference</h3>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain explained the British policy towards the Economic Conference to the House of Commons this afternoon. The ambassadors of France, Belgium, Argentina, Brazil, etc., the Swiss minister, and most of the other delegations participating in the Economic Conference were present to listen. Chamberlain first described how the World Economic Conference was convened and the situation at the opening of the conference, and then said that the need for currency stability was unanimously supported by all countries, but it was impossible to achieve it immediately because some countries believed that a tariff truce should be made temporarily, while at the same time establishing a currency truce. In other words, a temporary stabilization of currency. Before the opening of the Economic Conference, representatives of the central banks of France, Britain, and the United States agreed to proceed in this sense, but the White House rejected the plan for temporary currency stabilization, so that the agreement of the three central banks was equivalent to cancellation. In addition to this, there was a second attempt, which he considered harmless, which was to request governments to prohibit speculation. This attempt was also rejected by the US government, which caused problems for the life of the Economic Conference. The countries participating in the conference that maintained the gold standard and those that had free currency were divided into two factions, which have not been reconciled to this day. Chamberlain then made an optimistic statement, saying, "The mission of the Economic Conference cannot be considered useless after all, and the situation has become clear. Although the conference has suffered a considerable blow, it is not a fatal injury. In preparation for the final solution, the conference still has great potential. The main goal of the British government remains to raise prices, but we believe that although some elements of the currency problem are a prerequisite for economic recovery, raising prices cannot be expected from monetary action." Chamberlain concluded by saying that all hasty and unconsidered measures should be avoided, and that Congress should especially ensure that the government and all countries attending the conference can maintain friendly relations. (Tenth Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet held a meeting at 3 pm, chaired by Prime Minister Daladier. The attitude of Finance Minister Bonnet towards the Economic Conference was unanimously supported. Some people also expressed that France should only continue commercial negotiations with countries that maintain the gold standard and whose policies are the same as those of France, but no decisions were made, because France must first know on what basis the gold standard countries intend to negotiate before a decision can be made.

<h3>Soviet Russia Celebrates the Anniversary of the Constitution</h3>
<p>Counter-Revolutionary Forces Within the Country Expand</p>
<p>Seen in the Speech of Mr. Kuybyshev</p>
<p>▲National Moscow Telegram, 10th Today is the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet Constitution. The speech by Mr. Kuybyshev, a member of the Heavy Industry Committee, was extremely revealing, and the diplomatic community took note of it. Mr. Kuybyshev openly admitted in his speech that the counter-revolutionary thoughts among Soviet farmers have been growing. Mr. Kuybyshev stated that this increase in counter-revolutionary elements is due to the incitement of the petty bourgeoisie, who are trying to overthrow the Soviet government. The farmers are constantly thinking of harming the interests of the Soviets, so they echo this incitement. The diplomatic community in Russia, seeing Mr. Kuybyshev's speech so obvious, believes that the counter-revolutionary movement within Russia has indeed reached a dangerous scope. At the very least, it can be determined that the countryside is unclean. Furthermore, the Ukrainian region is the source of anti-Soviet activities. Now, with the poor harvest of agricultural products, the situation is even more dangerous.</p>
<h3>Talks by the Prime Ministers of Austria and Hungary</h3>
<p>Both Economic and Political Matters Were Discussed</p>
<p>▲National Budapest Telegram, 11th It is reported that the talks between Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös and Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss were purely economic in nature. It is heard that Gömbös suggested that the train from the Hungarian border to Vienna be electrified. The Austrian Prime Minister agreed to consider this proposal as soon as possible. The Austrian Prime Minister also suggested that the Hungarian government undertake part of the construction of Lake Neusiedl.</p>
<p>▲National Vienna Telegram, 10th Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös addressed representatives of the Vienna newspapers today, stating that Austria and Hungary must participate in the political life of Eastern Europe, especially the Danube region. He also said that he firmly believes that Central European countries should convene a conference to discuss issues related to all countries from a broad standpoint and eliminate all narrow-minded prejudices. Hungary and the Little Entente have begun economic negotiations, but have not yet reached a final result. Austrian newspapers emphasized the friendly nature of the Hungarian Prime Minister's visit, and said that Gömbös's sincere attitude when talking with Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss was especially comforting. The talks focused on economic issues and also involved joint actions that the two governments should take on various Danube River political issues.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Those who came from Sichuan talked about the situation in Sichuan. The problem is not that there is no way to organize the region, but that there is hope only if the defense zone system is broken. Sichuan is rich in the sixteen districts near Chengdu, which are known as the Land of Abundance. The soil is fertile. In addition to the two major harvests each year, miscellaneous grains, vegetables, and greens can also be grown. Since Liu Wenhui stationed troops there, land taxes have been pre-collected until the 55th year of the Republic. Taxes are collected five times a year, each time for two years. However, the people of these sixteen districts are still self-sufficient, because the people of Sichuan are accustomed to using domestic goods, and very few foreign goods are sold in Sichuan. According to recent estimates, foreign goods imported to Sichuan are only 6 million yuan per year. The population of Sichuan has now increased to 74 million, and agricultural production does not need external assistance. In short, the current civil war in Sichuan is real, and suppressing bandits is fake. Any construction can only be carried out after the defense zone is broken in the future. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia Announces Conditions for the Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>(Detained by the Japanese, newspapers not allowed to publish)</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo Correspondence: The original plan proposed by Russia for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway was temporarily detained by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs because it was deemed unfavorable to Japan. The Japanese newspapers were not allowed to publish it. However, on the afternoon of July 5th, Russia announced it to the world, and therefore, it had to be announced. The content of the Russian proposal is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The Status and Significance of the Object of Sale ① Based on the Beijing and Fengtian agreements, the Soviet government agrees to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway and all its affiliated properties to the Manchurian state (including the Chinese Eastern Railway and the properties illegally seized by the Fengtian government at various times). However, Soviet-Russian properties seized on the railway at the time, or vehicles that should be exchanged according to the agreement, and Soviet properties remaining on the railway due to incomplete exchange work, are of course not objects of sale. These properties should be returned to Russia, and a special committee will be organized to investigate and determine the properties to be returned. Thus, the properties that Russia wants to sell are as follows: 1. Main line: 1,726.0 kilometers, auxiliary line (including firewood transport line): 2,544.9 kilometers, telecommunication telephone line (including water supply equipment): 20,576.0. 2. Locomotives, vehicles, and operating materials belonging to the railway. 3. Railway-owned and other civilian houses with a total area of 1,199,762 square meters. 4. Factories and garages: various central factories in Harbin, maintenance section factories, and telephone section factories. 5. Various power plants. 6. Harbin Telephone Bureau. 7. River merchant fleet, including Harbin transfer wharf. 8. Railway land. 9. Forests in various places. 10. Medical institutions and veterinary facilities in various places. 11. Villas and sanatoriums in various places. 12. Agricultural enterprises in various places. 13. Sawmills, oil mills, and mechanical oil and rag cleaning plants. 14. Soft drink factory. 15. Wool mill. 16. Printing house. 17. Harbin tap water. 18. Bicycle factory. 19. School and club buildings. 20. All other buildings, facilities, and properties belonging to the railway. ② The Chinese Eastern Railway still occupies an important position in the industry and economic development of northern Manchuria today, and its value is extremely high when estimated from the perspective of Soviet property and economic interests. It should be specially recorded here that, due to the sale of this railway, a part of the various rights and interests stipulated in the treaty is therefore extinguished, and a part is greatly reduced in its existing value, such as the obligation to use a certain tariff privilege by thousands of Russian workers and employees. ③ Regarding the significance of the Chinese Eastern Railway, it should be specially emphasized that it is an important communication line in Eurasian transportation. The transfer of this railway will definitely remove various existing obstacles. The fact that the Chinese Eastern Railway does not lose this mission is very obvious. The Chinese Eastern Railway connects the fertile southern part of northern Manchuria, which is expected to develop in the future, and the ocean, and its mission as a main line in northern Manchuria is also very important. Not only is the significance of this railway not reduced by the transfer, but also the various obstacles are eliminated by the sale, which can increase its significance in Manchurian life. The more developed the Manchurian economy, the greater its significance. ④ The normal activities of the Chinese Eastern Railway should not be hindered by various special conditions that have arisen recently. Therefore, the temporary financial deterioration caused by this should not be used to misunderstand the substantial economic content of the railway, its significance, and its future development. This kind of misunderstanding has no basis. From the period of Sino-Russian co-management of the Chinese Eastern Railway to 1930, the total surplus of income and expenditure amounted to more than 140 million gold rubles, an average of 20 million gold rubles per year. This fact is sufficient to prove the above statement to be true. What should be specially described is that even in 1932, when the global economic panic greatly impacted the entire industrial life of Manchuria, the railway still obtained an operating profit of more than 12 million gold rubles under extremely difficult conditions caused by the above-mentioned special reasons. These facts are sufficient to prove the great economic power of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the stability of its foundation. Although the profits obtained by the railway were large, the Soviet government did not obtain much profit from the railway, because it had to continue to spend unproductive expenses such as the maintenance costs of the railway protection army, the maintenance costs of various government agencies, and the free transportation of passengers and goods. Although the Soviet representative had the intention to abolish this, it was opposed by China in the past, and now it is strongly opposed by Manchuria. (B) Purchase Price and Payment Method ① The purchase price of the Chinese Eastern Railway and its property should be determined according to Article 1, Section 2 of the Fengtian Agreement, which stipulates that when buying out, what is the current value of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and what kind of fair price should be used to purchase it. Based on the provisions of the clause, the Soviet Union accurately determines the basic item of the balance sheet of the actual expenditure amount spent on the construction and development of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and carefully considers all possible situations for reducing the purchase price based on the principle of fairness. ② The total amount of the Chinese Eastern Railway's construction costs, unfinished project progress costs, operating material purchase costs, losses suffered during the realization of construction capital, interest during construction, repayment costs, and the road's improvement costs up to the 1932 fiscal year amounted to 411,691,976 gold rubles. This amount does not include the 178,579,618 gold rubles spent by the imperial government in the years after the completion of the railway to make up for deficits and maintain the railway's operations. Furthermore, the railway's record of Soviet government debt for unpaid huge amounts of interest on invested capital is also not included in the total amount. The Soviet government considered that the technical equipment of the Chinese Eastern Railway had suffered a certain degree of loss, and that the economic significance of the railway had declined due to the construction of various railways, and reduced its purchase price to the maximum extent, setting it at 210 million gold rubles. ③ The Soviet government is willing to appraise the price of the railway land unconditionally retained by the Chinese Eastern Railway and the price of the Chinese Eastern Railway forest area as a total of 40 million gold rubles. This amount is much lower than its current fixed price. Therefore, the total purchase price of the Chinese Eastern Railway and all its properties is determined to be 210 million gold rubles, plus 40 million gold rubles, which is 250 million gold rubles. ④ This number is compared with the price that the Japanese government itself intended to pay the imperial government for the section between Kuanchengzi and Xiaogou of the southern line of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which should be 380 million gold rubles. Moreover, at the time of the negotiation, there were no artificial facilities worth specially mentioning in the Chinese Eastern Railway, and there were no valuable enterprises. As for the treaty and economic significance of the entire Chinese Eastern Railway, it was completely non-existent. Therefore, from various perspectives, 250 million gold rubles is a proper and fair purchase price. (C) Transfer of All Loans Together ① The Chinese Eastern Railway is transferred to the Manchurian state along with all loans, meaning that the Soviet government will not have any demands on the Chinese Eastern Railway in the future. ② In order to make it easier to pay the above-mentioned purchase price and stimulate the development of Japanese-Manchurian economic relations, the Soviet government agrees that half of the above-mentioned purchase price, namely 125 million gold rubles, can be paid in goods. The payment in goods can be paid in four installments over two years. In order to pay for the goods, the Manchurian state issues debt securities guaranteed by the National Bank of Japan or the Japanese banking group. ③ One-quarter of the total amount of 125 million in monetary payment should be spent in cash immediately, and the remainder can be paid by Manchurian national bonds guaranteed by the Japanese government, with an annual interest rate of 4%, and repaid in three years.</p>
<h3>War Zone Reception Underway</h3>
<p>He and Huang Convene Reception Committee for Discussion</p>
<p>Reception Scheduled for Completion Within This Month</p>
<p>Pseudo-Army Reorganized into 4,000 Men, Divided into Two Teams</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: The issues of receiving the war zone, dealing with the pseudo-army, and opening the BeiNing Railway, which have been negotiated for a long time, have been basically resolved since the Sino-Japanese representatives met in Dalian. The Japanese army began a general withdrawal on the 7th, and our side has now begun the reception, which is scheduled to be completed within this month. The representatives who went to Dalian for negotiations, Xue Zhiheng, Lei Shourong, and Yin Tong, returned via Dalian. Lei and Yin, accompanied by Qian Zongze, arrived in Beiping at 8:40 last night. After getting off the train, they went to the Juren Hall to meet He and Huang to report on the negotiation process and ask for instructions on everything, dispersing late at night. Qian Zongze, due to handling transportation matters, returned to Tianjin by special train at 1:20 this morning. Xue Zhiheng arrived in Tianjin at 5:00 PM yesterday. After getting off the train in Tianjin, he contacted Yu Xuezhong and the pseudo-army in Tianjin. He came to Beiping from Tianjin this afternoon. He Yingqin convened the representatives who went to Dalian and the reception committee members in Beiping at Juren Hall at 10:00 this morning (the 9th) to discuss the matter. Lei Shourong, Yin Tong, Tao Shangming, Li Zeyi, and others were present, and Xue Zhiheng also rushed to attend. First, Lei and others reported on the negotiation process in Dalian, and then a detailed discussion was held on the issue of the severance pay for the pseudo-army, the title of Li Jichun, and the reception procedures. A general decision has been made on everything. Regarding the pseudo-army, it has been decided to reorganize 4,000 men, divided into two teams, one team to be reorganized by our side, and the other team to be reorganized by Li Jichun. Luanzhou and Fengrun counties have been temporarily designated as reorganization locations, and the remaining pseudo-army will be dismissed. The pseudo-army side demanded a large amount of severance pay, and it has now been decided to issue it by name, at one yuan per person. The title of Li Jichun has not yet been determined. Li himself is very willing to obtain a title so that he can step down, but the authorities are considering the issue of granting Li's title, and a decision will be made after asking the Central Government for instructions. As for receiving the war zone, it will be carried out immediately, and if there are no other complications, it will definitely be completed within this month. Lei and other reception committee members will depart for Tianjin tonight and will convene a reception committee in Tianjin tomorrow to discuss all ongoing matters.</p>
<p>According to a representative who went to Dalian, the mission to Dalian for negotiations was not a formal meeting, and there was no formal text for all decisions, only minutes of the meeting were taken as the basis. After four or five secret and informal meetings in Dalian, the opinions gradually converged, and then a meeting was convened to discuss and decide everything. The main issues discussed were first, the disposal of the pseudo-army, and second, the issue of opening the railway. The issue of disposing of the pseudo-army was quite difficult. When Li Jichun arrived in Dalian, he brought more than one hundred military, political, and adjutant staff, creating a big stir. He claimed that there were a total of four brigades and seven detachments of the pseudo-army in Luandong, and that there was a reserve team of 120,000 men in the rear. During the negotiations, the situation almost broke down at one point. Later, the situation turned around after the Japanese representatives participated in the negotiations. Finally, it was decided to reorganize one-third of the 12,000 men, and the rest would be dismissed. A total of 4,000 men are to be reorganized, divided into two teams, and the reorganization will begin in Luanzhou and Fengrun. The pseudo-army demanded a large amount of severance pay, but it was not agreed upon in Dalian. The title of Li Jichun has also not been determined because it needs to be requested from the Central Government. Regarding the issue of opening the railway, after several contacts between Xu Jifu, Director of the BeiNing Railway, and Kan Duo of the pseudo-Fengshan Railway, it was finally decided that the BeiNing Railway would be fully responsible for the section west of Yuguan, and the section outside the pass would temporarily remain the same. However, the other party agreed to pay the interest on the British loan as usual, and the materials used by the BeiNing Railway would also be returned in full. In the negotiations, the term "outside the pass" was used uniformly to avoid recognizing the term "Fengshan" Railway. Now that the Luan River Railway Bridge has been repaired, through traffic between Ping and Tang has been fully restored, and through traffic directly between Ping and Yu will be realized within days. In the future, a combined transport method will be adopted, with combined transport between inside and outside the pass to facilitate transportation. After important issues such as the pseudo-army and opening the railway were agreed upon, the issue of the Japanese army's withdrawal was easily resolved. The Japanese army then began a general withdrawal on the 7th, and it should be able to withdraw completely in the shortest possible time, and our side's reception can be implemented. Preparations are currently underway, and it is expected that the reception must be completed within this month. (9th)</p>

At 8:00 AM on the 5th, they sailed to Hong Kong, five miles outside the Henglan Lighthouse, in our country's territorial waters, sailing very slowly. By about 5:00 PM on the 5th, the three warships successively sailed towards a location between 114.20 degrees east longitude and 22.5 degrees north latitude, advancing to the southwest, and then anchored in the waters of Chiwan, arranged in a straight line. The Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhaoh successively dropped anchor, but the furnaces were still burning, and red flags were raised to indicate martial law, so that ships would not approach to avoid danger. On the 6th, the three warships were in urgent need of replenishing food and coal, and once sent a small boat to the markets near Nantou and Chiwan to prepare food and daily necessities. After the three warships arrived in Guangdong waters, the Guangdong authorities still maintained a cautious attitude and did not publicly express their intention to accept them. The three warships entrusted Fang Nianzu (who once served as the captain of the Fu'an warship and was familiar with the captains of the three warships and the Guangdong naval circles) as a representative to contact the Guangdong authorities. The Guangdong military authorities immediately convened the Southwest Political Affairs Council and various committees to discuss response measures. It is heard that the conditions for the three warships to land in Guangdong are: first, Guangdong will issue the three warships' expenses every month, about more than 50,000 yuan in silver dollars; second, if the three warships return to Guangdong, the officers, staff, and sailors on the ships will continue to serve as usual and will not be changed. However, the authorities have not yet made a decision on this. For the sake of hospitality, it seems that a welcoming attitude is temporarily adopted. Therefore, the naval side here is still ordering two ocean warships from abroad according to a three-year plan to establish a new navy foundation. Naval school students have been sent abroad to study a month ago in preparation for the future establishment of a new navy. It seems that the Guangdong naval side does not want to change the future plan at present. It is also heard that if the three warships, including Haiqi, must stay in Guangdong, the authorities may request the Nanjing government to assist with the expenses to support the three warships.</p>

<h3>Brief History of the Traitor Hao Peng</h3>
<p>The traitor Hao, courtesy name Yucang, is 49 years old, from Sanhe County, Hebei Province. He graduated from Shandong Higher School and served as the general supervisor of various elementary schools in Fengtian, supervisor of middle schools, staff member of the education section of the education office, director of the Hubei Official Gazette Bureau, chief of the agricultural affairs section of the Shandong Educational Encouragement Office, Secretary of the Beijing Ministry of Finance, and Director of the Zhili Provincial Department of Finance, and acting Governor of Anhui Province. He likes gambling, so within a few years after being dismissed, his fortune was squandered. Last year, he conspired to cause trouble in Tianjin, and was arrested in Beiping in December. Because there was no evidence, he was later released on bail. After returning to Tianjin, he lived in the Yideli on Akashi Street in the Japanese Concession, claiming to be the commander-in-chief of the North China People's Autonomous Allied Army, issuing many letters of appointment, and mobilizing the army. Two assassination attempts against Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong failed. Hao recruited 2,000 plainclothes team members in the Japanese Concession. On April 19th, the riot failed, and he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars without success. The Japanese side then stopped supplying him. At 5:00 AM on the 6th of this month, he was escorted by his subordinates Yuan and Li in a car to the First Army Corps Headquarters. He was briefly interrogated by Chairman Yu and temporarily detained in the military court, awaiting the review of the Military Affairs Commission in Beiping (The attached picture shows the traitor Hao taken while awaiting trial in the military court).</p>

<h3>Xue Family in Base of the Sixth Picture Robbed</h3>
<p>The family of a rural resident surnamed Xue in the area of the base of the Sixth Picture in the southeast of DaZhangjing, 7-8 miles away from Songjiang, was kidnapped last year and rescued from danger. Unexpectedly, last night (the 10th) at about 11:00 PM, more than ten bandits came again, carrying pistols, broke into the house, drove the homeowner into a room and searched the room, robbing leather clothing and silver ornaments worth about more than one hundred yuan, and shooting the homeowner in the leg before fleeing. The neighbors heard the alarm and beat gongs, and sent someone to report to the Water Patrol Team headquarters, which immediately sent Li Jiarui to lead a team to pursue and arrest them, but there was no trace of them. The water and land police teams are currently pursuing them.</p>

<h3>Summer Cocoon Market Opens Gradually</h3>
<p>Although many households in the four townships raise silkworms this summer, the harvest is not good because the silkworms develop "hollow head" disease. Moreover, due to the high price of mulberry leaves, some households abandoned the silkworms, resulting in even fewer cocoons. The summer cocoon markets in various townships have opened one after another, but the goods arriving are not many. High-quality goods are priced at 30 yuan per dan (担), while second-quality goods are 20 yuan. Slightly more goods have arrived in Qianzhou, Yuqi, Maozhuqiao, and other places, and the price is also around 30 yuan. However, according to general silkworm farmers, this year's summer leaves are sold for 7-8,000 cash per dan, while the cocoon price is only 20-30 yuan, so it is still necessary to lose money after calculation.</p>
<h3>The Education Department Dispatches a Commissioner to Thoroughly Investigate the Jingzhi Case</h3>
<p>Regarding the Jingzhi Girls' School incident, since the Ministry of Education instructed the provincial Education Department to investigate and handle it, the entire board of directors of the school telegraphed the authorities requesting a thorough investigation. The Education Department specially dispatched Secretary Huang Shaohong, who arrived in Wuxi the day before yesterday. He first went to the county government to hold a discussion with County Magistrate Yan, and then met with Education Bureau Director Zang Fogen to inquire about everything. Immediately after, he invited reporters from the Wuxi Daily, Renbao, and Mingbao, as well as Xue Guozhi and Zhang Guanglin, who had submitted the above newspapers to the provincial Education Department requesting a thorough investigation, to the county government for questioning. He also inquired about Xue Weiqing, who had submitted articles attacking Jingzhi, asking whether such a person existed. If not, under what name was Xue writing? He requested that the original manuscript of the submitted articles be retrieved and sent to the authorities for verification. Since the Mingbao of the 3rd of this month had published a letter containing remarks about Xue Weiqing slandering Qian Yinzi, the principal of Jiangnan Girls' Middle School, reporter Yang Suwu from Mingbao and Qian Yinzi were summoned to the county government one after the other for questioning. Yang stated that the letter did exist, but he did not know the truth of the matter. Qian claimed that there was no such thing and that it was obviously a fabrication by a villain intending to slander her. Furthermore, no other major newspapers had published this letter; only Mingbao had. He requested a thorough investigation to clarify the truth. Yesterday morning, Secretary Huang, together with Education Bureau Director Zang, summoned all relevant parties to the bureau for questioning. He is scheduled to return to the Education Department tomorrow to report his findings.</p>

<h3>Tang Haida, a Notorious Bandit, Apprehended in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Wuyi County government repeatedly ordered the detective team to arrest Tang Haida, a notorious bandit who was at large. The detective team leader, Ni Gusheng, immediately dispatched detective Zhang Wei to investigate and arrest him in Shanghai. After two months, at around 8 p.m. on the 8th of this month, Zhang and others apprehended the notorious bandit Tang Haida (who had changed his name to Tang Yunhai) on Longjiang Road. He was immediately escorted to the Yulin Road Police Station for detention and later transferred to the Special District Court. On the 10th, Team Leader Ni reported to the county government, requesting that an official letter be prepared and personnel dispatched to escort him back.</p>

<h3>County Government Executes Two Notorious Bandits by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Jiang Sanbao and Tao Changxiang, notorious bandits from Dongxiang, committed numerous crimes. They were apprehended by the Public Security Bureau, interrogated by the county government, and confessed to being bandits. County Magistrate Ye, in accordance with the telegram from the provincial government regarding bandit suppression, sentenced the two bandits to death and submitted the sentence to the province for approval. On the 10th, a telegram was received approving the execution. The two bandits were immediately escorted to the execution ground west of the city and executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Wheat from North Jiangsu Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The provinces of North Jiangsu, including Tongzhou and Taizhou, have had a bumper wheat harvest this year. Large quantities of wheat seeds have been transported to Shanghai in recent days.

<h3>Measures to Rescue Three Pawnshops</h3>
<p>Magistrate Ma, considering that only Dexin, Fucheng, and Dunjie pawnshops in the city were experiencing economic difficulties and had requested to cease operations, not only rejected their requests but also instructed the First District Office, the County Chamber of Commerce, and the Pawnshop Association to discuss rescue measures. This morning (the 10th) at 10 a.m., Chairman Wang of the Chamber of Commerce specially convened a meeting to discuss the measures. First, Chairman Wang Jingtong reported on the county magistrate's order to convene a meeting for discussion. Then, Zhao Boang, the manager of Dexin Pawnshop, described the difficulties faced by the pawnshops, stating that the main problem was that the inventory was difficult to sell, and the price had exceeded the capital. Moreover, the interest on loans was above 1%, while the interest on pawn loans was limited to 2%, and various expenses were increasing daily, resulting in losses, making it impossible to sustain operations, hence the request to cease operations. Next, rescue measures were discussed. The Chamber of Commerce, the First District Office, and the Pawnshop Association jointly submitted a request to the county government, asking them to forward it to the provincial government, stating that the cessation of operations of the three pawnshops had a close relationship with the rural economy and social finance. They requested that the Farmers Bank be allowed to lend money to the pawnshops to sustain the livelihoods of the poor and regulate social finance. Before the request was approved and officially replied to, the pawnshops would continue to operate as usual to avoid panic in the market.</p>

<h3>Fudan University Student Commits Suicide in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Dai Jihe, a student at Fudan University in Shanghai, from Anhui, 21 years old, came to Hangzhou on the 30th of last month, using the alias Yue Qiutan, claiming to be from Fujian. At 2 a.m. on the 7th, he committed suicide by taking sleeping pills. The next morning, he was discovered unconscious and sent to the hospital for treatment. For three days, he was unable to speak. He only regained consciousness yesterday and was showing signs of recovery. When asked about the reason for his suicide, he refused to reveal the truth. A patient in the hospital (who was Dai's classmate) found out and telegraphed Dai's brother, Zu Yi, at the Yicheng Silver Company in Shanghai to come to Hangzhou to retrieve him after signing a guarantee.</p>

<h3>Fire in Sanwan Alley</h3>
<p>Yu Meigu, a resident of Sanwan Alley in Ningbo, 26 years old, worked at Yongfengyu Seafood Store on Shuangjie Street. Last year, he also opened the Jiufeng Melon Seed Shop at his home. At around 1 a.m. yesterday morning, a fire broke out for unknown reasons, causing a conflagration. Yu and his wife and children managed to climb onto the roof of a neighboring house and escaped unharmed. However, the Xia family, a family of five living next door, only had one elderly mother escape. The husband, wife, and two children are missing, and it is feared that they have perished in the fire. The fire destroyed a three-story house, with losses estimated at around 7,000 to 8,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Declaration</h3>
<p>Today, we gather in Shanghai, gathering anti-Japanese people from all groups in the city, gathering anti-Japanese hearts from all aspects of the country, to welcome Generals Ma, Su, Li, and Wang. There is really nothing to welcome. Looking at the lost land of the Northeast and observing the trend of politics, we feel ashamed and hateful, and we can only gather together and cry. The reason why we must restrain our heartache and force a smile is because we have hope in the generals. Today, the situation in our country has fallen into the period when Qin destroyed the six kingdoms. Not only do the generals who hold the army value the policies of their leaders and put the anti-Japanese cause on hold, but also the patriotic people hold the fallacious theory of protecting themselves wisely and put the anti-Japanese cause aside. Disintegration, seeking temporary peace with each other, how can we talk about anti-Japanese? I am afraid that if we want the country not to perish, we cannot get it. Therefore, today, the way to save the country is not to seek political power, nor is it to seek military power, but whether we can get the return of undying people's hearts. The restoration of the country in 1911 and Gandhi's resistance to Britain were not done by political and military power, but by the undying people's hearts. Therefore, the reason why we welcome the generals today is not because the generals have escaped danger and returned, but because the generals have the spirit of anti-Japanese, which is enough to lead the undying people's hearts of the whole country, unite them, and make them resist Japan and save the country. If this spirit of anti-Japanese and the undying people's hearts can be united and united, not be tempted by private opinions, not be divided by wealth and power, and not be surrounded by the theory of waiting fifty years to sing praises, then the power of its display will definitely increase day by day, which can promote the self-consciousness of the selfish and help the government's long-term resistance declaration become a reality. We are deeply afraid of the pain of national subjugation, and we also know that the affairs of China are not impossible to do. Therefore, on the day of welcoming the generals, we hold this view to seek sympathy. In the past, the generals were far away in a remote area, although they suffered from exhaustion of ammunition and supplies, they were still able to drive horses to kill thieves and fight for the personality of soldiers. Now that the generals have returned from abroad, watching the success of Germany, they will be able to lead the masses and seek survival for the nation. All of us people whose hearts are not dead should know the shrinking territory and the destruction of the country, go to difficulties with one heart, and follow them to the death, so that the generals can show the courage to kill the enemy in the past and build the cause of resisting Japan in the future, then one word will prosper the country, and three families will destroy Qin. Not only can Gandhi and Hitler not be exclusively beautiful in the past, but also a government with genuine resistance will also benefit from it.</p>
<h3>Follow-up Report on the Collision of the Tunan</h3>
<p>87 Crew Members and Passengers Rescued</p>
<p>200,000 Silver Dollars Sunk with the Ship</p>
<p>The Tunan, a ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was sunk off the coast of Chengshanjiao, Shandong, by the Japanese ship Choshun Maru. Many crew members and passengers were killed, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, we received a follow-up report, which is reported below.</p>
<h3>Crew Members in Distress</h3>
<p>The collision of the Tunan occurred in the middle of the night, and the ship sank quickly, so many of the crew members did not have time to escape, and many drowned with the ship. According to the company's confirmation yesterday, the deceased crew members included Zheng Jinsheng of the second class, Zhao Yongji of the steward department, one helmsman, six stewards, five sailors, and six stokers. The bodies of these 20 people have not been reported to have been recovered. In addition, the total number of deceased tea boys and passengers has not been reported, and it is feared that more passengers than crew members have been killed.</p>
<h3>List of Rescued Persons</h3>
<p>The crew members and passengers rescued by the Choshun Maru on the spot were 87, according to a telegram sent to Shanghai yesterday by Jiang Changqing, including shipowner Jiang Changqing, first mate Sun Zuoren, second mates Chen Fuwen, Huang Bao, Kong Xingui, Chen Guoxiong, etc., six people from the sailor department Zhang Xiaoquan, Yu Bingsheng, Zhou Xingcai, Fu Asheng, Yuan Yanzi, Sun Awei, Wang Yungen, Zhou Genfu, Sun Ating, Yuan Erhao, Wang Baocai, Ming Zhao, Yang Rifeng, etc., thirteen people from the stoker department Ying Bingsheng, Qiu Fushun, Zhang Fuchang Zheng Yushun, Zhou Zicheng, Qian Zhonghua, Hu Baofu, Chen Changgen, Zhang Afa, Chen Axiao, etc., ten people, steward Chen Amao, Sun Meitang, etc., two people, business department Shao Jingyao, Zhou Hongxi, Wang Yusun, Li Afa, Li Aming, He Aqing, Wang Huaibing, Du Tongyi, Chen Rongliao, Wang Fuquan, Wang Shengfu, Li Zhicheng, Xu Azhang, Luo Wefu, etc., twenty-two people, Passengers rescued include Helen, a Westerner, Hribar Hel, Chinese Qiu Zhiying, Kong Xiaosan, Tang, Yang, Zhong Huixin, Jiang Guoji, Liu Xiaofu, Ma Zhaorong, Li Fuzi, Tang Ziping, Ye Amao, Fan Xuanheng, Ge Shunfu, Xie Shigan, Ai Si, Dai Shunding, Xiu Lun, Li Changkui, Wang Hongxian, Liu Shenggen, Yang Zhiyu, Li Zhemin, Guo Jiaheng, Hu Jingquan, Zhao Hongde, Su Rulin, Lu Xianglin, Yang Fengchi, Cao Hongbin, Liang Aozi, Gao Ruizhai, Dong Chuanxian, Lou Maotong, etc., thirty-four people,</p>
<h3>Dispatching Ships to Salvage and Rescue</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has urgently telegraphed the Yantai branch to quickly dispatch two ships stationed in Yantai to the vicinity of the sea area near Beishashan to search for any crew members and passengers who fell into the water and are waiting to be rescued, as well as the bodies of those who drowned on the ship, or those that have floated to the surface of the sea, and ordered them to salvage them, take photos for identification, and if there are any rescued crew members and passengers, the Yantai branch will find ways to send them to Shanghai. Yesterday, the Yantai branch telegraphed back that it had complied with the instructions.</p>
<h3>Loss of Mail</h3>
<p>The sinking of the Tunan this time was very fast, and none of the items in the ship were taken out, and even the crew members only escaped with their bare bodies. When leaving Yantai, the local post office had 73 ordinary letter mailbags, 4 express mailbags, and 2 printed matter mailbags, a total of 79 mailbags, which were all sunk with the ship. The company received a report yesterday and has informed the local postal administration for verification.</p>
<h3>Cargo Losses</h3>
<p>The cargo loaded on the Tunan in Yingkou included more than 1,460 pieces of miscellaneous grains, 1,400 pieces of soybean cakes, 3 vats of soybean oil, and many other miscellaneous goods, and a lot of goods were also loaded in Yantai for Shanghai, all of which were sunk. The seabed there is very deep, and salvage is very difficult. The company has informed the customers who picked up the goods in this port.</p>
<h3>Huge Sum of Money Sunk</h3>
<p>When the Tunan left Yantai on the 9th, a branch of a certain bank in the port had 195,000 silver dollars, divided into 39 boxes, each box containing 5,000 yuan, which were handed over to the Tunan for transportation to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the ship was sunk, and this huge sum of money was sunk into the seabed along with the ship. A certain bank in Shanghai received the news and urgently telegraphed the Northeast Navy to send ships to protect the sinking ship and discuss ways to salvage the money from the seabed to avoid losses.</p>
<h3>Sending Letters for Negotiation</h3>
<p>The Tunan was sunk by the Choshun Maru, and the rescued crew members and passengers have safely arrived in Dalian. The company sent a telegram yesterday ordering shipowner Jiang Changqing to lead the crew members and passengers to Shanghai as soon as possible and order them to take the Dalian steamship to leave. The company also sent a letter to Dalian Steamship Company, stating that the rescued crew members and passengers on the Tunan should be sent back to Shanghai as soon as possible by your company's ship, but the travel expenses of each person should be borne by your company. It is estimated that the rescued crew members and passengers can arrive in about two days.</p>
<h3>Aftermath Issues</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the company, only a part of the crew members who died has been found, and the exact number of deaths is still unknown. The company also does not know the details of the passengers who died in the disaster, and we must wait for Jiang Changqing to return to Shanghai to understand. Regarding the aftermath of the disaster, such as compensation, etc., the company has precedents to follow, and there will be no problems at that time. The issue of responsibility for the collision is the most important. After the crew members return to Shanghai for questioning, the negotiation steps will be determined. The company has telegraphed the Ministry of Communications in Beijing to report the sinking of the Tunan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Repair</h3>
<p>The bow of the Choshun Maru was also damaged when it collided with the Tunan. Yesterday, the ship sent a telegram to Shanghai saying that the Choshun Maru will be docked for repairs after unloading cargo and passengers in Dalian, and will not be able to sail immediately. It is estimated that it will have to suspend its voyages three times, about 21 days, before the repairs can be completed and it can sail again. The Choshun Maru has 4,260 tons and is very fast. At this time last year, the ship ran aground outside the port of Yantai and overturned. It took two months of salvage and five months of major repairs before it could resume service. It has not been sailing for long and has caused a major disaster again.</p>
<h3>Li Du's Representative, Wang Ziyao, Flew to Singapore Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Ziyao, the representative of General Li Du, took the Eurasia Aviation Company's No. 2 plane to Singapore yesterday at five o'clock in the morning. This trip is to represent General Li to inspect the troops stationed in Singapore, instructing them to follow the orders of the central government and guard the border. Mr. Wang will stay in Singapore for about a month and will also contact the Singapore provincial government to discuss future aid issues.</p>
<h3>The Naming Ceremony of the Tianchu Airplane Will Be Held on the 16th</h3>
<p>The Test Flight in Hongqiao Yesterday Morning Was Successful</p>
<p>The Location is Set at Jiangwan at 3:15 to Host All Sectors</p>
<p>The Tianchu MSG Factory donated a Junkers-type fighter plane to the government. After it was transported to Hongqiao Airport for assembly, it was piloted by a pilot sent by the German Junkers Aircraft Manufacturing Factory for a test flight at 9:30 yesterday morning. It took off from Hongqiao Airport, circled the city, and the rate of ascent, descent, and turning all conformed to the contract.

<h3>The Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association Hosted a Banquet for Three Generals Last Night</h3>
<p>Chu Fucheng Gave a Speech Encouraging Continued Efforts</p>
<p>Ma, Su, and Li Thanked the Relief Association for Its Assistance</p>
<p>Park Byung-san Reported on the Recent Situation in the Northeast</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association hosted a banquet for Generals Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, and Li Du, and various anti-Japanese army commanders at the Youth Association in Baxianqiao on the 9th floor last night. During the banquet, Chairman Chu Huiseng gave a welcome speech, and Generals Ma, Su, and Li gave speeches in reply. The banquet ended happily at 9:30 p.m. The situation is recorded below.</p>
<h3>List of Attendees</h3>
<p>Those who attended last night included General Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, General Su Bingwen, Commander of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese Army, Deputy Commander Zhang Dianjiu, General Li Du, Commander of the Northeast Border Defense, Jiang Songnian, Councilor of Heilongjiang Province, Wu Huanzhang, Party Affairs Committee Member, Fan Ruizheng, Secretary, Liu Piguang, Li's Representative in Shanghai, Army Commander Park Byung-san, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce, Lin Kanghou, Banking Association, and Chu Huiseng, Chen Peide, Chen Yafu, Zhang Juansheng, and more than 40 people from the Volunteer Army Relief Association.</p>
<h3>Chu Huiseng's Speech</h3>
<p>Chairman Chu Huiseng said in his speech, "Today, the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association welcomes Commander Ma, Su, Li, Zhang, and various anti-Japanese army commanders and representatives, because the Relief Association and you have a very close relationship, like family members, and there is no need to be polite. Since the September 18th Incident, the citizens of Shanghai have known that the first person to resist Japan was General Ma Zhanshan, so they all expressed their extremely warm sympathy. Not only Shanghai, but the whole country is like this. Even overseas Chinese and international friends have expressed their sympathy, because Japan disregarded international treaties and disregarded justice to invade China's sovereignty and territory. Japan thought that no one in China could resist, but who knew that our Chairman Ma would disregard everything at that time and rise up to resist the enemy. The Battle of Nenjiang Bridge is the most remarkable example. Afterwards, our General Li Du also rose up to resist Japan and maintained it for a long time. Finally, Commander Su also rose up to resist Japan in Manzhouli, disregarding everything and dealing with Japan. We, the people, deeply admire this kind of spirit, and it is especially commendable that the Japanese have offered bribes to the generals with money and high positions, using various methods of temptation, but the generals were unmoved. It can be said that their determination is as firm as gold and stone, and they have persisted for a year in hardship and difficulty. Only with this kind of spirit can they be able to do it. Therefore, the people can express their twelve-point enthusiasm for the three generals, which is also here. The organization of the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association originally hoped to provide assistance to the anti-Japanese heroes, but due to the relationship of strength, it was unable to fully provide assistance, which caused the generals to retreat due to exhaustion of ammunition and supplies. This is what the Relief Association is most ashamed of, and it is the regret that the three generals could not recover the lost land of the Northeast. The people should at least bear a great responsibility. After being forced to retreat into the Russian border, they returned to the country, intending to reorganize and continue to resist Japan, but the domestic ceasefire agreement has been signed. At this time, the generals had to endure for a while. Now you still hold the spirit of resisting Japan from beginning to end, so the Relief Association, in addition to expressing twelve points of welcome to you in the past, especially welcomes your future struggles. At the same time, I hope that our colleagues in the Relief Association and the people should also work harder to be a backing so that when the time comes to resist Japan in the future, there will be sufficient assistance in spirit and material. Finally, I wish the generals good health."</p>
<h3>Li Du's Response</h3>
<p>General Li Du then stood up to respond, saying, "We are deeply grateful for the banquet hosted by the Support Association today, but also deeply ashamed. Since the September 18th Incident, the four northeastern provinces were not yet entirely lost at that time. General Ma resisted at the Nenjiang Bridge in the front, and then my brothers and I pursued in the rear, striving to support it. As a result, the three northeastern provinces were still not recovered, and I did not sacrifice myself for the country. Even when retreating, we were disarmed by a third country, enduring the pain overseas. Although we have now safely returned to the country, I feel ashamed to face the elders at home. Shanghai is the largest metropolis in the country, and historically has always provided great assistance to the revolutionary cause. During the anti-Japanese war in the Northeast, we received a great deal of donations, enabling us to fight for more than a year, all thanks to the support of Shanghai. After the defeat, the refugees were once again taken in and resettled. This kind of spirit is the same as fighting on the front lines. Just now, I saw the chairman encouraging colleagues to continue the anti-Japanese war in the future. In my personal opinion, the past anti-Japanese war has come to an end, and failure is also a fact. Now, the 30 million people in the Northeast are suffering under the tyrannical Japanese, and their pain has reached its extreme. Therefore, as long as the Northeast is not recovered for one day, our responsibility will not be complete for one day. In the future, the anti-Japanese war will still require the Support Association to actively prepare, and then there will be many opportunities. Now that Japan occupies the Northeast, it is like a robber's act of robbery. Our country still has many provinces, land and people, and it is impossible that even three provinces cannot be recovered. During the European War, the independence of the Balkans and Poland can serve as a lesson for the past. In the future, the anti-Japanese war should be considered from the national perspective. Over the past few decades, the historical evolution and political changes of our nation have indeed made good progress. If the national spirit is not dead, and there is still a breath left, we can continue to struggle, not only can the three northeastern provinces be recovered, but it is also not impossible to look proudly at the world. In the future, we should adhere to the doctrine, recognize Japan as the enemy, fulfill our national responsibilities, not engage in empty talk, those who carry guns will fight, those who do not carry guns will provide supplies, and fight as one from the front to the rear. Then, when the opportunity comes, it will be the time for us to strive to be strong," and so on.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan's Speech</h3>
<p>"At this time of hot summer, I am deeply grateful for the welcome hosted by the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association. Now, I would like to express two points of view. ㈠ I feel ashamed towards the Support Association. ㈡ I feel ashamed towards the compatriots at home and abroad. Because our army failed to protect the territory of the Northeast and did not die for the country, this is a great disgrace for a soldier. During this return journey, I heard that the ceasefire agreement was signed, and I knew that the government had plans to change its anti-Japanese policy. However, from the standpoint of anti-Japanese, our will and spirit should never be changed. I had already sworn on the boat that if the Northeast is not recovered for one day, our responsibility will not be over for one day. Up to this point. However, what is most heartbreaking now is that when I look around the country, there are still many people indulging in the pursuit of personal interests, causing the central authorities to feel even more difficulties. Finally, what needs to be stated is that the achievements we made in the Northeast last time were by no means due to our personal abilities. This is actually the achievement of all the people in the Northeast, the compatriots at home and abroad, and the Support Association. There are many opportunities to save the country in the future. I still hope that the Support Association will give us spiritual and material assistance and support at any time. This is not only what I personally hope for."</p>
<h3>Su Bingwen's Speech</h3>
<p>"I am very honored to have this opportunity tonight to gather with you all. As Mr. Chu Huiseng said, we were originally one family, and there is no need for lyrical embellishments. Because of the September 18th Incident, there was the rise of the anti-Japanese military affairs, and then there was the establishment of the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association. At that time, I led my troops to deal with the Japanese invaders in a hurry. There was no overall preparation beforehand, and afterwards, I was isolated from the central government, fighting alone. Without the spiritual encouragement and material support of the Support Association, it would have been difficult to continue. However, I was eventually forced to retreat to Russia due to the exhaustion of ammunition and supplies. The details of the process need not be elaborated upon at this time. Defending the country and killing the enemy is the duty of a soldier. At that time, I always hoped to maintain armed resistance for one more day, and to increase the strength for diplomatic struggle by one point. Unexpectedly, the reliance on the fair handling of the League of Nations and the so-called treaty sanctions all became empty promises, which led to a lesson today, that is, if you want to seek regret and save the country, you can only rely on your own strength. In the future, if the hearts of the 30 million people in the Northeast are not dead, and the national spirit of the compatriots at home and abroad is not discouraged, there will be a day when the lost land will be recovered. Many people recently abandoned their anti-Japanese aspirations because of the truce in North China. However, they did not know that the truce agreement was the government's overall foreign policy, while our aspiration was the foundation for the revival of the nation, which must not be shifted with the superficial situation. As a soldier, my efforts to save the country are still nothing more than shouldering a gun and killing the enemy, being a pioneer for the people. I only hope that the comrades of the Support Association will continue to be its backing, so as to run through this glorious page in the history of the nation. I sincerely encourage you all," and so on. Later, General Pu Bingshan, who had just come to Shanghai from Heilongjiang, reported on the recent situation in the Northeast. His words were profound and sincere, and extremely sad and tragic, as well as speeches by Zhang Zilian and others, which will not be recorded due to their length.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Went to Nanjing Last Night</h3>
<p>Staying in Nanjing for a Day and Then Transferring to Jiangxi</p>
<p>Visiting Chiang Kai-shek and Then Going to Hubei to Take Office</p>
<p>Zhang Qun, the newly appointed Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, took the 11:30 PM express train to Nanjing last night to ask the central government for instructions on everything, then transferred to Jiangxi to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and then went to Hubei to take office. Those who went to the North Station to see him off last night included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Yu Hongjun, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Xingya, Director of the Municipal Security Department Yang Hu, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Qian Xinzhi, Wen Lanting, Xu Xiuzhi, Directors of the Two Roads Bureau Huang Boqiao, and the head of the Secretariat Section of the Municipal Government, no less than a hundred people. Mr. Zhang told the reporter of this newspaper in the train last night that he plans to stay in Nanjing for one day, then go to Lushan to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, ask for instructions on everything, and then go to Hubei to take office.</p>
<h3>The Two Roads Unions Announced the Settlement of the Salary Increase</h3>
<p>Four Points of Request, the Roads Bureau Has Largely Expressed Acceptance</p>
<p>The Roads Bureau Ordered to Report the Roster to the Ministry Before the 15th</p>
<p>Shanghai Times News, The staff of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Roads have repeatedly requested the Roads Bureau to implement the routine salary increase through the two Roads Unions. Now, both the Bureau and the Union believe that the issue should not be delayed for a long time, and they have jointly invited more than 30 representatives from various branch offices to Shanghai to continue to ask the Bureau for a definite response. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>The Settlement Process</h3>
<p>After the representatives petitioned the two Roads Unions on the morning of the 10th, the Union decided to send five of its directors, Min Luoheng, Chen Bohua, Feng Qichun, etc., to contact Director Huang and put forward four points of request: ㈠ Please increase salaries according to the old annual salary increase rules, and cancel the performance appraisal method; ㈡ The salary increase method for those above 100 yuan should be announced at the same time as those below 100 yuan; ㈢ If the announcement of the salary increase period is after the date set by the Ministry, it should be supplemented according to the usual practice; ㈣ Please recognize that the two Roads Unions have the legal right to represent all employees. After Director Huang considered the above four points, except for the fourth point, which he believed still needed to be considered, but was not absolutely rejected, he expressed that for the sake of understanding the situation, he would completely approve the other three points. The record of the conversation was sorted out by the Union yesterday and submitted to Director Huang for reference and approval, and then it was announced to all members based on the record. The Roads Bureau also issued an order on the same day to delete the section on performance appraisal to avoid doubts, and immediately ordered the submission of the roster of all staff before the 15th, so that it could be submitted to the Ministry for approval and announced as soon as possible. The staff of the two Roads expressed complete satisfaction with this, and the representatives left Shanghai in batches the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Union Announcement</h3>
<p>For the sake of announcing to all, it is reported that the various branch offices of this Union have repeatedly come to request this Union to request the Bureau to maintain the original method and announce it as soon as possible in order to stabilize the people's hearts regarding the annual salary increase issue for the 22nd year. On the 10th of this month, the directors of this Union took the petition and met with the Director in person, who kindly understood the situation and answered frankly as follows: ㈠ Regarding the performance appraisal and salary increase method, it will be handled completely in accordance with the provisions of Article 29 of the Railway Employees Service Regulations. As for the standard for performance appraisal based on work performance previously promulgated, the Roads Bureau's intention was nothing more than to make the scope of performance appraisal concrete and eliminate malpractices. Since many employees were unable to understand it, it may as well be deleted to avoid doubts; ㈡ All staff of the two Roads who should receive a salary increase this year have been ordered to prepare a roster and send it to the Bureau for verification and addition before July 15. The salary increases for those above the 30th grade should be submitted to the Ministry for approval, and will be announced at the same time as the Ministry's approval is received; ㈢ According to the Ministry's order, the end of June of each year is the performance appraisal period. If the period of announcement of the salary increase is after the period of the salary increase, it will be supplemented according to the usual practice. The above three points are the issues that the staff of our two Roads have been looking forward to and urgently need to resolve. Now that the Roads Bureau has complied with public opinion and made a clear statement, it should be announced to all members, hoping that all members will understand this and work with peace of mind to seek the development of the road affairs. This is what we hope for. This is the announcement.</p>
<h3>The Taxpayers Association Sent a Letter to the Ministry of Industry Requesting the Recall of the Order to Relocate the Rubber Factory</h3>
<p>Refining Luminous Oil in Another Location Will Reduce Danger</p>
<p>The Mechanical Industry Association Hired Experts to Automatically Inspect and Improve</p>
<p>Since the Yiyuan, Da Zhonghua, and other rubber factories were repeatedly ordered to relocate by the Ministry of Industry within a limited time, the Rubber Trade Association petitioned the Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Taxpayers Association. The Taxpayers Association sent a letter to the Ministry of Industry yesterday to inquire, and replied to the Trade Association. The Mechanical Industry Association also held a standing committee meeting yesterday to discuss. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>The Taxpayers Association Sent a Letter to the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession, based on the letter from the Rubber Trade Association, sent a letter to the Ministry of Industry yesterday, requesting the recall of the relocation order. The original letter said, "To the Director: We have received a letter from the Shanghai National Goods Rubber Products Industry Association (the original letter has been seen in yesterday's newspaper and is omitted), etc. Based on this, it is found that the Hongda and other rubber factories were suddenly notified to relocate this time. According to the statement published by your Bureau's Information Office in the Greater Shanghai Evening News on July 8, it was handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 30 of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations and has nothing to do with the inspection of factories, which shows that your Bureau respects our country's labor administration and the resolution of the General Assembly of this Association on this case, which is gratifying. However, the provisions of the aforementioned Article 30 are far before the establishment of the rubber factories, and the establishment of the rubber factories is not a recent fact. It is inevitable that the outside world suspects that it contains other effects besides safety and hygiene, and should avoid giving people the opportunity to criticize. However, this Association has no objection to maintaining safety and hygiene under the premise of not hindering our country's sovereignty. However, what is still problematic is that the aforementioned Article 30, which has never been applied to factories, is once strictly enforced, and the result will inevitably lead to the closure of factories and a sharp increase in unemployed workers, which will affect social order, because it is not like ordinary houses, which can be moved at will. Therefore, this Association does not want the public's safety and hygiene to be constantly threatened and left to nature, but it also does not want to let factories close down, workers lose their jobs, and increase the social livelihood problem. Therefore, it is proposed that your Bureau seek its hygiene and safety without ordering the factories to relocate. The most likely cause of fire danger in rubber factories is the refining of luminous oil, which can be handled by selecting another location for the factory, so the threat to safety can be removed as the main reason. In addition, hygiene and other safety equipment can be gradually carried out according to their financial resources and time, so that both public and private interests can be achieved without difficulty. These opinions have also been discussed with the representatives of the association and are considered worthy of adoption. Before the letter, we hereby inform you, hoping that you will investigate and take steps to recall the relocation order and seek its safety and hygiene without harming the existence of the factory."</p>
<h3>The Taxpayers Association Replied to the Trade Association</h3>
<p>The Taxpayers Association replied to the Rubber Trade Association yesterday, "To the Director: We have received your letter on July 9, stating that the Ministry of Industry of the Public Concession notified the Hongda, Yiyuan, Dade, Tianxing, and other rubber product factories, citing the Zhengtai factory tragedy as the reason that the buildings and equipment of the factories were not suitable for rubber factories, and ordered them to relocate within a limited time to avoid danger, etc., and your association stated everything, and we have received it. After investigation, the actions of the Ministry of Industry this time did not allow for time, which is tantamount to punishing without teaching. The statement published by the Information Office in the Greater Shanghai Evening News on July 8 said that this move has nothing to do with the inspection of factories and is to enforce the provisions of Article 30 of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations. Although it may be a kind of embellishment, it seems that we cannot ignore its desire not to openly undermine the integrity of our country's labor administration and to violate the resolution of the General Assembly of this Association on this case. However, the provisions of the aforementioned Article 20 are before there were rubber factories in the concession, and the establishment of rubber factories is not a recent fact. Now, the aforementioned Article 30, which has never been applied to factories, is strictly enforced, and it is difficult to avoid the suspicion of infringing on the right to inspect factories. This is where the Bureau failed to check in advance. However, the public's safety and hygiene are maintained, and your association also believes that it is natural, and the public will also approve of it. After discussing with the representatives of your association, we believe that the most likely factor to cause a fire in a rubber factory is the refining of luminous oil. If this kind of refining is handled in another location, the threat to safety will be minimal. In addition, other safety equipment and hygiene arrangements can be carried out gradually according to financial resources and time, so there is no need to relocate the factory, and there will be no problems with the closure of the factory, the loss of jobs for workers, and social impact. Before the letter, in addition to sending a letter to the Ministry of Industry, please take steps to recall the relocation order and seek its safety and hygiene without harming the existence of the factory, and we hereby reply, hoping that you will investigate it."</p>
<h3>The Mechanical Industry Association Held a Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mechanical National Goods Factory Federation, on the grounds that the houses were not suitable for manufacturing and endangered social peace, repeatedly notified various rubber factories to relocate within a limited time, disregarding labor and capital welfare and going its own way. After sending staff to negotiate without success, a special standing committee meeting was convened at the Ningbo Road Association at 3:00 PM yesterday. Song Peidao, Ye Hancheng, Zhu Zhenhan, Ji Jiannan, and other four people attended. After discussion, they all said that although the Bureau's surface only cares about social peace, it actually contains the intention of factory inspection, and the Bureau's facilities are not fully in line with it. Because the factories are unable to build their own factory buildings, they will gradually declare closure, and the number of unemployed industrial and commercial workers will increase day by day. The Bureau's premise of social peace is actually no peace to speak of. For this time, it is planned to jointly hire experts from various national goods manufacturers to conduct inspections by themselves. If there is a dangerous one, they will provide guidance and improvement, so that the Ministry of Industry will have nothing to do. At the same time, manufacturers and workers can avoid unemployment. After the public decision, it can be implemented.</p>

<h3>Zhu Jiqing's Troops in Rehe Repelled the Enemy</h3>
<p>Zhu Jiqing's National Salvation Army, which was resisting the enemy in Rehe, fought fiercely until the afternoon of Geng Day and had repelled the enemy from all directions. Mr. Zhu continued to receive two telegrams from the front as follows: ㈠ Supervisor Junjian, the enemy invading Zhang Jiyingzi is said to be led by the puppet Li Maochun. We made contact at 10:00 AM on Yu Day (6th). They swept us with machine guns, cavalry, and artillery, and we also returned fire with machine guns and mortars. After a fierce battle until the morning, the enemy retreated after failing. The people's association intercepted and surrounded them at Chuanxindian Guangfuyingzi and other places, and they were defeated. Only forty or so enemies escaped at Gengxiao, and the rest were killed. In this battle, we captured three enemy light machine guns, one cavalry gun, more than ten rifles, and more than ten horses. We also killed two people and injured more than ten people. In addition, three or four innocent old and young people were shot and killed by enemy soldiers. I am reporting, Zhi Wang Chunting Kouchong Geng, ㈡ Supervisor Junjian, (A) The enemy attacking Qinjiayingzi again fought fiercely until 4:00 PM on Geng Day, and the enemy could not hold on. He joined forces with the enemy who had retreated from Gangyaoling and retreated to Gangyao (telegraphic code unknown), (B) According to the report this morning, the remnants of the defeated enemy in the north have obtained reinforcements at Shuangmiao and are attempting to counterattack, (C) In this battle, Wang Zhen, Zhao Qingquan, Zhao Wansan, Zhao Shangshi, Li Shuzhen, and Chen Gui were the most effective. Please send a special telegram to commend and reward them, (D) Yang Xiushan, Han Mingxin, Xiao Lianju, Liu Yi, Liu Huanzhang, Zhang Shoushi, etc. were also quite effective. Please send a telegram to commend and reward them, and please send a telegram to comfort the people here for bravely killing the enemy. Zhi Wang Chunting Koujia,</p>
<p>Zhu Jiqing received several more telegrams from Rehe yesterday, reporting the enemy's brutal behavior, the battle situation of his troops, and the indignation of the local people. Here are two of them: ㈠ Urgent, confidential, Supervisor Junjian, (A) There was no battle yesterday. The enemy who retreated to the north is now southeast of Shuangmiao. The situation of the enemy who retreated from Gangyaoling is unclear, (B) Wang Zhen and Zhao Qingquan's troops have advanced north to [], and Zhao Wansan's troops have advanced south to []. Liu Huanzhang and Li Shuzhen's troops are still at []. I am reporting, Zhi Wang Chunting Kouhui, ㈡ Urgent, confidential, Supervisor Junjian, The Japanese puppet army killed hundreds of old, young, women, and children in various places this time, and burned down seven places including Gangyaoling, Dumayingzi, Sanjiazi, Bajiazi, Dabinggou, and Cunhao, and looted countless livestock and vehicles. The people's feelings are extremely indignant. Even those who have been holding a wait-and-see attitude have automatically requested that our headquarters assemble troops and launch a large-scale anti-Japanese war. (Omission) The [] People's Association and the Volunteer Army have established contact, (omission) Zhi Wang Chunting Kouhui,</p>
<h3>The Dispute Over Loading and Unloading at Maigen Station Was Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou and Beijing-Shanghai Roads Bureau previously planned to change the loading and unloading system at Maigen Road Station, but the road workers opposed it and it could not be implemented. Later, the Ministry of Railways sent personnel to investigate thoroughly, and it was shelved. Unexpectedly, Yang Hengzhen, a foreman who had previously been entrusted by the Roads Bureau, suddenly set up an office at No. 41 Taiyangmiao the day before yesterday, which aroused suspicion among the workers. They thronged to the place to question him. Fortunately, the Council of the Road Trade Union discovered it, and on the one hand, sent people to persuade the workers, and on the other hand, sent a letter to the Roads Bureau yesterday, requesting that it be strictly prohibited. A disturbance was temporarily quelled.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency telegram from Nanjing on the 11th stated that the Ministry of Railways sent Tan Yaozong to Nanjing to meet with the person in charge of the Central Civil Training Council to discuss a solution to the dispute over the loading and unloading workers at the Maigen Road Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Roads.</p>
<h3>The National Goods Industry Discussed Participating in the Weihaiwei National Exhibition</h3>

<h3>The Economic Committee Sorted Out the Achievements of the Sericulture Industry</h3>
<p>League of Nations Sericulture Expert Dr. Marie's Successful Experiment</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Deputy Chairman of the National Economic Committee, believes that if China's sericulture industry continues to decline, it will have a profound impact on China's economic future. Therefore, the Economic Committee researched methods and, in the spring of last year, specially hired sericulture expert Dr. Marie from the League of Nations to come to China to investigate the sericulture industry in order to improve it. Dr. Marie had previously inspected the silk-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and wrote a report on the inspection process and the points that should be improved, detailing them to the authorities. Model areas and improvement areas were subsequently established in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and began to be implemented. As a result of the experiment, the spring cocoon harvest this year opened a record of production that had not been seen in 30 years. The details are divided as follows:</p>
<h3>Instructing Rearing</h3>
<p>Since the authorities of the Economic Committee made overall plans, Dr. Marie suggested that model and improvement areas be established in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Dr. Marie also went to Hangxian to work and implement the prescribed plan, using improved silkworm seeds, co-raising young silkworms to the second instar, and establishing guidance centers to specialize in teaching silkworm farmers how to rear them, and constantly researching and improving them.</p>
<h3>Excellent Results</h3>
<p>The spring cocoons this year have been researched and improved, and the harvest is excellent, even exceeding the highest yield in the past 30 years. The average cocoon price is 40 yuan per dan, and in Wuxi it is as high as 60 yuan. However, the local varieties of farmers still have poor harvests, with an estimated loss of 100,000 dan of silkworm cocoons, totaling 4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Establishing Model Areas</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department opened Xiaoshan and Lin'an as silkworm breeding model areas this spring, training 60 instructors and sending them to the two areas to guide. Later, Hangxian, Jiaxing, and Haiyan were added as model areas, and an autumn silkworm instructor training center was added, enrolling 300 students and starting training. If there are many people, it is necessary to make large-scale expansions</p>
<h3>Italian-Chinese Hybrid</h3>
<p>The Italian-Chinese hybrid yellow silkworm seeds issued by the committee earlier have achieved good results. Farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are unwilling to sell these silkworm cocoons and save them all to reel native silk, because their silk content is rich. As for the cocoons of the Italian-Chinese hybrid variety produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, they have been reeled by silk factories in Hangzhou and Wuxi, and the results are also very good, far better than white cocoons</p>
<h3>Continuing the Experiment</h3>
<p>In order to promote the improvement of silkworm seeds, the central government has decided to continue the experiment this autumn and next spring. If the harvest color can be compared with this spring, then China's silk will be revived from now on. At present, most of the silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have started operations. Only in Wuxi, about a dozen have not started operations due to a lack of manpower.</p>
<h3>Details of the Economic Commission's Engineering Department Handling the Yangtze and Han River Flood Prevention</h3>
<p>Xi Dejiong Returns to Shanghai After Inspecting the East</p>
<p>Xi Dejiong, Director of the Engineering Department of the National Economic Commission, in mid-June, when the Yangtze River water level surged, recalled that during his time with the Flood Relief Committee last year, the repaired main levees of the Yangtze and Han Rivers were encountering their first major flood, raising concerns. Furthermore, as the Yangtze and Han River Engineering Bureau was taking over the unfinished projects of the Work Relief program and the water conservancy and levee projects of Hubei Province, just as they were nearing completion, it was especially necessary to urge Meng Jin to pay close attention to flood prevention. Therefore, on June 17th, he flew from Beijing to Wuhan, where he consulted with the Construction Department of the Hubei Provincial Government to agree on cooperative measures for flood prevention, aiming for concerted efforts. He also instructed the Yangtze and Han River Bureau to allocate flood prevention funds according to the importance of different sections, purchase flood prevention materials, and direct the original engineering offices to follow the prescribed flood prevention methods and cooperate with local governments. During the flood prevention period, all flood prevention personnel were prohibited from requesting leave or resigning for any reason, to avoid negligence. The high water level of this summer flood was unprecedented in nearly a hundred years for the same month, causing residents to feel uneasy, as if a major disaster was imminent. Fortunately, the main levees repaired by the Flood Relief Committee and the Economic Commission were built to be one meter higher than the highest water level in twenty years. After this flood, the levees remained four to five feet to seven to eight feet higher than the water level. However, dangerous situations were still seen in places such as Shangche Tan in Jianli, Xiazi Gou in Jiayu, Tuanfeng in Huanggang, and the Qikou levee opposite Jiujiang. Thanks to strict precautions, the main levees along the river remained intact and did not collapse. However, small private levees were sometimes overflowed due to insufficient height. Unexpectedly, just as Hubei Province was celebrating its escape from danger, the lower reaches suddenly reported a crisis. Xi left Wuhan on the 3rd of this month to inspect the levee conditions in eastern Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui, instructing the Jiangxi-Anhui Engineering Bureau to take appropriate precautions to avoid negligence. He passed through Beijing on the 9th to handle various matters and returned to Shanghai from Beijing on the 10th.</p>
<h3>The Second Annual Meeting of the China Cotton Production Statistics Association Was Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Drafting a Complete Investigation and Statistics Plan</p>
<p>Requesting Financial Assistance from Industrial Organizations for the Investigation</p>
<p>The China Cotton Production Statistics Association held its second annual meeting yesterday morning at No. 80 Avenue Edward VII. More than 20 representatives from various provinces attended. Fang Junqiang chaired the meeting, with Wu Weijing as the recorder. Jiang Dixian first reported on the association's work over the past year, followed by discussions on proposals. 1.

<h3>Establishment of the Pfeiffer Council</h3>
<p>Commemorating Professor Pfeiffer's Immortal Work</p>
<p>General Zhu Qinglan Attended in Person</p>
<p>Professor George W. Pfeiffer, an American, has served in China for 43 years. The endeavors he undertook, such as the colonization of Anhui and the Northeast, the relief of water and drought disasters in various regions, the afforestation of Zijin Mountain in Nanjing, the founding of the Anti-Opium Society, the establishment of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry at Nanjing Jinling University, and the introduction of Chinese students to internships in major British and American factories, have all made significant contributions to our country. Professor Pfeiffer's friends and students in China, in order to commemorate his immortal work and to encourage the continued spirit of service to our country in the future, specifically organized the Pfeiffer Council. Yesterday happened to be Professor Pfeiffer's 73rd birthday. The council held its inaugural meeting last night at 7:00 PM on the ninth floor of the Shanghai YMCA at Baixianqiao, in celebration. Honorary member General Zhu Qinglan, Huang Renlin representing Kong Xiangxi, Liu Guangpei, and more than 20 other members attended. Liu Guangpei, the temporary chairman, delivered a speech detailing Professor Pfeiffer's entrepreneurial history in China and the process of organizing the council. The person is currently in the United States and will soon return to China to serve. Zhu Qinglan and Huang Renlin then delivered speeches praising Pfeiffer's arduous and immortal work, and his adventurous spirit, which is worthy of emulation by our youth. Finally, Liu Guangpei was elected chairman, Liang Dizhong as secretary, and Lu Enguang as treasurer. The meeting adjourned around 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Committee for Clearing Confiscated Goods from the Former Anti-Japanese Association Plans to Sell Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>The Proceeds from the Sale Will Be Used to Repay the Debts of the Former Anti-Japanese Association</p>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign General Merchandise Association Will Find Ways to Correct Errors</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association was ordered to disband, the Committee for Clearing Confiscated Goods from the Former Anti-Japanese Association was established to clear the confiscated enemy goods. The goods have been reviewed and, except for those to be returned, the rest have been approved by the municipal government for sale. The Chinese and Foreign General Merchandise Association, concerned that some of the goods confiscated by the association were not Japanese, will unite with its members to address this issue and seek rectification. A reporter from the New News Agency has recorded the original letters from the Committee for Clearing Confiscated Goods and the Chinese and Foreign General Merchandise Association as follows:</p>
<h3>Selling Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>The Committee for Clearing Confiscated Goods from the Former Anti-Japanese Association sent a letter to various trade associations the other day, stating: "We are writing to inform you that the review of the confiscated goods from the Former Anti-Japanese Association has been completed. As for how to dispose of the remaining goods, except for those to be returned, we have submitted a report to the municipal government for approval. The approval allows our committee to classify and count the goods, determine fair prices, and prepare a list for your respective trade associations to sell. Whether the original owners of the confiscated goods accept the sale is up to the discretion of the trade associations. For those goods that cannot be sold through the trade associations, our committee will seek reputable merchants to undertake the sale to ensure credibility. All proceeds from the sale will be submitted to the municipal government for future allocation to repay the debts of the Former Anti-Japanese Association. The municipal government has also ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to cooperate in this matter. If your association agrees to this plan, we will send you the list after the goods have been sorted. Apart from this letter, we are also sending separate letters. We hope to receive your reply within seven days. Respectfully, the Committee for Clearing Confiscated Goods from the Former Anti-Japanese Association."</p>
<h3>Finding Ways to Correct Errors</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign General Merchandise Association also sent a letter to various trade associations yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that regarding the case of non-Japanese goods mistakenly confiscated by the Former Anti-Japanese Association, we should urge the Committee for Clearing Confiscated Goods from the Former Anti-Japanese Association to promptly return them. Our representative, Chen Yujie, made a suggestion at the fourth meeting of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, which was approved and submitted to the municipal government for the Committee for Clearing Confiscated Goods from the Former Anti-Japanese Association to handle. However, we have recently discovered that the Committee for Clearing Confiscated Goods, regardless of the source of the confiscated goods, has decided to confiscate non-Japanese goods, which is a blatant misrepresentation. If we do not find a way to correct this, we cannot protect the merchants' capital. Our association is deeply saddened by this and is writing to you specifically. If any of your members have similar cases of goods being confiscated, please inform our association within three days of receiving this letter. Our association will work with your association to take effective action."</p>
<h3>The King of Norway Presents the Order of Saint Olav to Mellor</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported that the King of Norway has awarded Sir Frederick Maze, Inspector General of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav, in recognition of his services in managing maritime affairs, surveying coastal hazards, and protecting navigation. Norwegian ships account for five percent of foreign shipping in the Far East and occupy an important position.</p>
<h3>Jin Shuren Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>"New Voice News" reported that Jin Shuren, the former chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, left Tacheng with his family after the turmoil in Xinjiang Province. He then took a route through Russia, Siberia, and Vladivostok to Shanghai. It was learned yesterday that Jin and his family have arrived in Shanghai and are currently residing in a certain road in the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Suffers from Major Floods; Petitioning for Relief After Levees Break</h3>
<p>The Chinese Relief Society recently received a report from Fu Junsheng, a relief worker in Anhui Province, stating that the Guangcheng levee in Huaining County collapsed at 6:00 PM on June 26th. More than 30,000 mu of mature farmland and over 8,000 people within the levee have suffered this catastrophe, which is unspeakable. On the day after the levee broke, he carried bread and went to distribute it for emergency relief to maintain the current situation. He also received a donation of 10 shi of rice from Tan Shulian, Director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to help with relief, barely supporting them for ten days. However, there are many victims, and it is difficult to sustain this. Local charitable organizations are weak, and the government has no funds for relief. Although the water level has receded by five or six inches, the water accumulation in the levee is still more than ten feet deep, and there is no way to remedy it in the long run. After repeated consideration, the only option is to implore the society to donate relief supplies or send personnel to distribute them, or entrust it to be handled. Only with more relief funds can more lives be saved. Awaiting a reply to alleviate the suffering. Attached are seven photos of the disaster situation for your kind consideration. The society provided large sums of money and sent personnel for relief when Guangji Levee and Tufengou Levee were breached in the province's floods last year. However, due to the impact of the current situation, donations have become depleted and the society does not have the power to help. It is unbearable not to provide assistance. Alas, all that can be done is to cry for help. It is hoped that charitable comrades at home and abroad will share food and clothing to alleviate the catastrophe to the greatest extent possible, and the merit will be boundless.</p>
<h3>Disaster Victims from Lihuang County Gather in Hefei</h3>
<p>Commissioner Zhao Reports by Telegram</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Office of the World Red Swastika Society received a telegram from Commissioner Zhao yesterday, reporting that the burial work in Huoshan had been completed. On the way to Hefei, the suppression army on the border of Lihuang attacked again, and more than 20,000 refugees from the Xihu area of Lihuang fled to Hefei, sleeping in the scorching sun, which was extremely miserable. He requested that funds be allocated for relief. The society has already allocated 1,000 yuan for emergency relief and is continuing to find ways to raise funds. Subsequently, Liu Zhenhua, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, also sent a telegram appealing for refugees in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces. The society immediately replied, reporting on the emergency relief efforts in Liu'an, Huoqiu, Huoshan, and Lihuang, the burial work in Huoshan, and the recent accommodation of 20,000 refugees from Lihuang. It has been learned that Chairman Liu has sent another telegram requesting the society to raise more funds for relief. The original telegram is as follows: "Shanghai Tanshui Road Red Swastika Society Southeast Main Branch Shanghai General Office: Your telegram of the winter is received with respect. Twenty thousand refugees from Lihuang are gathered in Hefei. You, gentlemen, are committed to providing emergency relief, and have also provided emergency relief and large-scale burials in Liu'an, Huoqiu, and Huoshan, bringing life back to the dead. We are deeply grateful. Now that the general offensive is about to begin, it is expected that even more will continue to flee. We urge you to raise more funds and rush to provide emergency relief to avoid homelessness. We jointly express our gratitude. Liu Zhenhao."</p>

<h3>Two Axe Gang Leaders Arrested</h3>
<p>The Once Powerful Axe Gang Revives</p>
<p>The Leader and Deputy Leader Came to Shanghai from Jiaxing to Plot Activities</p>
<p>丨Arrested Yesterday at the Baiyulou Teahouse丨</p>
<p>Decades ago, Shanghai had an Axe Gang leader named Zheng, who led his gang in doing evil and dominating the area. Even Ma Yongzhen, the strongman who claimed to be able to defeat opponents from north and south and kick around the world, who set up a ring in Jing'an Temple in western Shanghai at the end of the Qing Dynasty, was assassinated by the gang, which caused a sensation at the time. Even today, people in Shanghai still shudder when they talk about the gang. Later, due to the authorities' strict pursuit and arrest, the gang's ferocity began to subside slightly. However, in recent years, with the advancement of science, the tools for killing have become more sophisticated day by day. With the prevalence of pistols and Mauser pistols, the clumsy axe is no longer in line with the times. Therefore, the gang members have disappeared and are no longer heard of. Even in Shanghai, it seems that one evil gang has nominally disappeared. Unexpectedly, recently, an Axe Gang has been discovered in Jiaxing. Its leader, Chen Fugui, is 36 years old and from Zhuji, and the deputy leader, Qiu Yaoshan, is 34 years old and from Shaoxing. They usually lead their gang in extorting money from the people, committing all kinds of evil. If anyone resists slightly, they will gather a large number of gang members, each armed with sharp axes, to assassinate them. The people in the area who have suffered from them are not few. Recently, the local Shangbao newspaper was completely destroyed by the gang for publishing news about the gang. Later, because the local Public Security Bureau offered a reward for their arrest, Chen and others knew that it was difficult to gain a foothold, so they came to Shanghai with the deputy leader and others to secretly prepare to revive the once powerful Axe Gang. A Ningbo native named Zhu Yousheng, who had been in the towing business, recently had a dispute with Wang Changming, a Shaoxing native, who wanted to compete for Zhu's business but failed, accumulating resentment. Zhu had known Chen and others for a long time and learned that Chen and others were staying in Shanghai. Therefore, at about 2:00 PM yesterday, Zhu invited Chen Fugui, Qiu Yaoshan, Liu Adong, and others to Baiyulou Teahouse on Guanqiao in the Nanshi district to have tea and discuss the matter. The district chief of the area, Guan Gong, detected this and immediately dispatched detectives Yuan Haishan, Zhang Zhongliang, and police officer Hu Yuzao to the teahouse. They took all the people back to the district. After a preliminary interrogation, it was found that Chen and Qiu were the wanted Axe Gang leaders who had not been arrested in various places. Therefore, they prepared a document and submitted it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Two More Main Culprits Arrested in the Assassination of a Public Security Bureau Informant</h3>
<p>The Motives for the Assassination Were Twofold</p>
<p>One Was Jealousy, and the Other Was Revenge</p>
<p>Zhang Xinshan, a 62nd Precinct informant for the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and a native of Anhui, was stabbed to death by three assailants with knives at the entrance of Chongyi Lane on Marong Road in the French Concession on the 5th of this month. It was not until the other day that Lu Ying, the captain of the precinct, dispatched officers to arrest Guo Yushan, one of the perpetrators in the case, in front of the Golden Grand Theatre in Baixianqiao in the French Concession. The details have been reported in this newspaper. However, the two main culprits in the case, Li Decai and Guo Shanyu, were at large. After Captain Lu repeatedly questioned Guo, the perpetrator finally confessed the true whereabouts of Li and Guo. Therefore, at about 12:00 PM the other day, he ordered the original investigators to split into two groups. One group went to the thatched house behind the Texaco Oil Company at the Gaoqiao Desigco Wharf in Pudong and arrested Li Decai. The other group, together with the Chinese and foreign detectives from the Hongkou Yulin Road Police Station, arrested the main culprit Guo Shanyu at the matchmaker's shop at No. 379 Pingliang Road in Yangshupu. Both were taken back to the precinct. According to Guo's confession, he was 33 years old, from Chaoxian County, Anhui, and formerly resided at No. 152 Beile Road in the French Concession and had no occupation. According to Li's confession, he was 31 years old, from the same hometown as Guo, and formerly resided at No. 279 Marong Road. Both admitted the motives for killing Zhang. Guo confessed that it was because Zhang had forcibly occupied his mistress. Li claimed that it was to avenge his teacher Huang Haiqing, who was killed by Zhang. After the interrogation, the three perpetrators, along with a pistol and seven bullets, were sent to the department yesterday for verification.</p>
<h3>The Third Day of the National Silk Exhibition</h3>
<p>Over 10,000 Visitors Despite the Sultry Heat</p>
<p>The Belgian Consul-General and His Wife, Mr. and Mrs. de Feffe, Also Visited</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of the National Silk Exhibition. The number of visitors reached more than 10,000. In the afternoon, Mayor Wu Tiecheng and the Belgian Consul-General and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. de Feffe, also visited. The grand occasion did not diminish compared to the first two days. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Meeting Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the exhibition and the entertainment show opened simultaneously. Vice Presidents Wang Xiaolai and Wang Yansong, committee members Luo Qinghua, Gao Shiheng, Zheng Chengqing, Chen Songyuan, Yu Wuting, Lu Zhengbing, and Qin Runqing, and Chamber of Commerce members Ye Jiaxing, Lu Wenshao, and Fang Jiaobo, totaling more than 20 people, attended. After the Vice President gave a speech, Fang Jiaobo, Qin Runqing, and Yu Zuoting all gave earnest speeches.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Talk</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng visited the exhibition at 3:30 PM yesterday, accompanied by Wang Yansong, Luo Qinghua, Lu Zhengbing, and ten others. They toured for a week and had tea at the Guanshengyuan shopping mall. During the tea, Mayor Wu praised the exquisiteness of domestic silk fabrics and was particularly concerned about the fabrics that used rayon. It is said that the government believes that the import of rayon is increasing day by day, and the use of rayon in silk fabrics is almost inevitable. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry plans to invest 3 million yuan to establish a rayon weaving factory in Shanghai to avoid the outflow of money. However, at the beginning of the establishment of the factory, it is necessary to cooperate with Italian or German businessmen to achieve rapid and effective results. He hoped that silk merchants would strongly support this.</p>
<h3>Foreign Guests Visit</h3>
<p>The number of visitors yesterday still reached more than 10,000. In the afternoon, the Belgian Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. de Feffe, and his wife visited, and were received by Chairman Wang Yansong and English Secretary Yan Wanzhi. Mrs. de Feffe praised Chinese silk fabrics incessantly.</p>
<h3>The Husband Returns to Find His Wife Dead and the Tenant Forcibly Demanding Funeral Expenses</h3>
<p>And Detaining Two Children as Collateral</p>
<p>The Bizarre Circumstances Lead to Litigation</p>
<p>Yan Agui, a 36-year-old local resident living at No. 77 Shenyuli, Liangdaitou, near Huayuan Stone Bridge in Pudong, works as a boatman. His wife, Fu, is the same age as Yan and has one child of each gender, a two-year-old son and a nine-year-old daughter. Since the house has an attic, Fu rented it to a tenant, Zhang Siming from Shandong, two years ago. Zhang, who has no wife or family, boards at Fu's house, paying a total of 10 yuan per month for rent and meals. Yan did not object when he returned home. On the 5th of this month, Yan returned home from a business trip by boat. Unexpectedly, Zhang suddenly told Yan that his wife had died on the 1st of this month and that Zhang had bought clothes and a coffin for her funeral and paid for her medical expenses when she was ill, totaling about 200 yuan, which Yan should repay. Zhang is now holding the two children as collateral. Yan was shocked to hear this and went to inquire about his wife's death from relatives and friends. According to his cousin, the coffin was donated by the Cimucai Society, and the only clothes the deceased wore were blue cloth shirts and trousers. Yan suspected foul play. He thought that since Zhang was willing to pay a large sum of money for his wife's medical expenses when she was ill, why would he hide the children and demand money after her death? He considered the means too cruel and reported the matter to the Third District Police Station for investigation. The district summoned Zhang Siming yesterday. According to the plaintiff's accusation, the defendant forcibly detained the children and extorted money. He also stated that his wife had clothes and ornaments worth about 300 yuan, which were also embezzled by the defendant. He requested that they be recovered. According to Zhang's statement, Yan's wife became ill in March of this year, and he successively paid for her medical treatment, which actually cost a lot of silver dollars. The two children are indeed with him. The plaintiff, upon hearing this, stated that his wife had no symptoms of illness when he returned home last month, but the defendant claimed that she had been ill for many months, which was extremely suspicious. He requested an investigation into the cause of his wife's death. The district chief found the case very bizarre and ordered the defendant to be detained pending investigation of the facts.</p>
<h3>Suicide Case of Japanese Nationals in Hongkou Park</h3>
<p>A Man and a Woman Commit Suicide by the Pond</p>
<p>The Man Was a Waiter and the Woman Was a Maid</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language "Shanghai Japanese Daily", at 5:00 AM on the 11th, a suicide case involving Japanese nationals Seiryu Hideji (19 years old) and Japanese woman Zuka Kuchi Ryoko occurred near the pond in the northeastern corner of Hongkou New Park. The gardener Zuo Jianjun reported the incident to the Public Works Department, which, together with the police from the Japanese Consulate, sent them to Fumin Hospital for treatment. Both the man and the woman had knife wounds on their throats and lost too much blood, resulting in loss of consciousness. Qingliu is from Nagasaki and is currently working as a waiter at the Shungling restaurant on Chapu Road. Ryoko was originally a maid at the Shishi pavilion on the Dazhi Road and later married Zuka Kuchi Youichi from Nagasaki. During her time at the Shishi pavilion, she had a relationship with Qingliu. Both parties were deeply in love. Ryoko was not on good terms with her husband and was also infatuated with Qingliu, so she resorted to this desperate measure.</p>
<h3>Merchants and Vendors on Jiangyin Street Reluctant to Move to the Vegetable Market Built Behind the South Railway Station</h3>
<p>丨Organizing a Committee...Responding to the Charitable Organization丨</p>
<p>The vegetable market planned and built behind the South Railway Station by a charitable organization, and prepared to move the Jiangyin Street vegetable market by bidding, was approved by the competent authorities and is about to be built. The merchants and vendors on Jiangyin Street were deeply afraid that business would be bleak after the vegetable market was moved. The vegetable vendors also believed that their business would be greatly affected after moving to the vegetable market. Therefore, the merchants and vendors automatically and unanimously united to oppose it. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the merchants and vendors consider the relocation of the Jiangyin Street vegetable market to the new vegetable market a matter of personal interest. They held a meeting to discuss the matter the other afternoon. More than 50 merchants and more than 200 vendors attended. Zhang Mingchang was elected as the temporary chairman. After the chairman reported the purpose, it was decided to organize the "Shanghai Hunam District Jiangyin Street Business Community Vegetable Vendor Committee to Maintain the Original Vegetable Market Site." Five representatives were elected to be responsible for conveying the reasons for not moving to the competent authorities. They also believed that the motive for building the new vegetable market behind the South Railway Station was initiated and planned by the Shanghai Charity Organization. Therefore, they prepared a document to respond to the Charity Organization's reply letter of July 7.</p>
<h3>Another Repercussion of Overestimated Land Prices</h3>
<p>The Chengyu Company Vigorously Opposes</p>
<p>The Real Estate Association, based on a report from its member, the Chengyu Company, has lodged an objection, stating that the Municipal Council, disregarding facts, has overestimated land prices in the Eastern District by 60%. They urge all property owners to confront this issue together. A special letter was sent to all committee members yesterday, which reads: "Regarding the letter from our member, the Chengyu Company, stating that when they built on their property No. 685 in the Eastern Section in the eleventh year of the Republic, the assessed value was only 1,500 taels per mu. From the eighteenth year of the Republic, this value was gradually increased to 6,300 taels, which our company considered appropriate and never objected to. Unexpectedly, since the January 28th Incident, property owners in the Eastern District have been affected by rent exemptions, rent evasion, and rent defaults, resulting in heavy losses. The actual revenue collected last year was less than half of previous years. To this day, the entire city is in decline, with no hope of recovery. We have considered selling at a reduced price but cannot find buyers. This is obvious to everyone, and we believe it is also understood by the committee members. Under these circumstances, the Municipal Council's land tax should be reduced, not increased, and a fair judgment should be made. However, the Municipal Council has disregarded the facts and is only interested in excessive taxation, increasing the assessed value of our property by 60% to 10,000 taels per mu. Neighboring properties have also been similarly overvalued. We have already submitted the above reasons to the registered agent and strongly object. We are specifically suggesting to your association to notify all members to submit reasons for objection and make a collective protest. If the Council insists on its own way, disregarding public opinion and rashly implementing this, our company would rather face the penalty of resisting the tax than pay it blindly, etc., has been received. It is noted that the decline of the real estate industry since the January 28th Incident last year is obvious to everyone. If land prices are further overestimated and land taxes are increased, how can we bear it? Unless we express our firm opposition together, the real estate industry will be in even more dire straits. Based on the aforementioned circumstances in the letter, we hereby request that you advocate together to avoid future troubles. Respectfully, Shanghai Real Estate Association."</p>
<h3>Recent News on Aviation Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued an order yesterday to the Aviation Lottery Office stating that the lottery period must not be extended, that no handling fees should be deducted from prize winners, and that measures must be taken to ensure the safety of those claiming prizes.</p>
<p>To facilitate purchases by the lower social strata, the Ministry of Finance has decided that each of the second issue of Aviation Highway Lottery Tickets will be divided into five strips, with each strip selling for two silver dollars. The prize amounts will remain the same as in the first issue, and the awards will not be changed.</p>
<h3>Construction Lottery Office Distributes Second Batch of Airplane Leaflets</h3>
<p>The National Government's Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Office, on the first of this month, arranged with the China National Aviation Corporation to dispatch airplanes to distribute leaflets in Shanghai, Nanjing, Haizhou, Hankou, Chengdu, Chongqing, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Beiping. When the leaflets were distributed, crowds thronged the streets, scrambling to pick them up, demonstrating the public's sympathy. The first issue of lottery tickets is scheduled to be drawn on the 31st of this month in a large theater in Shanghai. To attract public attention, the Lottery Office has printed another 400,000 leaflets, which will be distributed by special airplanes from the China National Aviation Corporation in major cities throughout China within the next few days.</p>
<h3>Tragedy of Two Children Drowning Together</h3>
<p>丨 Parents Should Pay Attention 丨</p>
<p>In the past three days, the weather has been extremely hot, with the Fahrenheit scale reaching almost 100 degrees. As a result, the general lower-class people are complaining incessantly, and bathing in the Huangpu River has become extremely popular. Consequently, tragic incidents have been frequently reported. The other day, two children from the Yuan family in Hongkou went to a nearby beach to take a cold bath. As a result, the younger child tragically drowned and joined the water spirits. Coincidentally, yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, two boys from Yinxiang Township in Pudong also suffered the same fate while bathing in a cold bath. This can truly be said to be a unique coincidence. The two boys, named Zhou Yongsheng and Zhou Fugen, were both 13 years old, lived in bungalows in Yinxiang Township, were neighbors, and had a strong bond. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, because of the heat, they went to the Huangpu River on Ningguo Road in Yangshupu to bathe. Unexpectedly, neither of them knew how to swim, and shortly after entering the water, they both drowned. People who were bathing nearby noticed this and tried to retrieve them. They carried the bodies ashore and reported it to the Western police at No. 144, who used a car to send them to the Tongren Hospital to transfer them to the mortuary for examination.</p>
<h3>Misunderstanding in the Family Causes Turmoil in Love</h3>
<p>Oaths of Love and Sincere Words</p>
<p>Good Times Don't Last Forever</p>
<p>丨 Father Demands Return of Photos but is Firmly Refused 丨</p>
<p>丨 Someone Actually Splashes Nitric Acid in the Dark of Night 丨</p>
<p>Sun Yufeng, a 22-year-old from Tianjin, previously studied at Qiuzhen Middle School in Tianjin. Due to poverty and the impact of the war, he dropped out of school and came to Shanghai in 1929 to seek help from his maternal uncle, Li Fengming. Li lived at No. 157 Jishi'anfei Road in western Shanghai. He used to be an inspector in the Public Security Bureau and is now employed at the Xinchang Silk Factory. Seeing his nephew come from afar to seek help, he accommodated him and allowed him to stay at his home. Two months later, Sun saw an advertisement in the newspaper for the Police Training School and applied. He was accepted and graduated after three months of training at the police school. He was assigned to serve in the Second Precinct of the First District. In his free time, he often visited his uncle. Li had a beloved daughter named Hongshun, also known as Li Meilan, who was 28 years old.</p>
<h3>Beautiful Appearance</h3>
<p>She used to study at the elementary school established by the Catholic Church in Caojiadu. She and Sun had a good relationship. Whenever they had free time, they would discuss academic matters in the same room. This continued for over a year. Sun was not satisfied with his low police salary, and when he heard that the China General Edison Company was recruiting, he applied. He was hired and quit his police life to become a businessman. A few months later, he was assigned to work as a switchboard operator in the Western District of the Shanghai Telephone Company. Because it was close to the Li family, he visited even more frequently. His feelings for Li's daughter increased imperceptibly. At that time, Li Meilan's school was closed due to the Shanghai war, and she was idle at home. Therefore, every weekend, they would go out together, either to watch movies or stroll in the park.</p>
<h3>The Heat of Love</h3>
<p>Reached a boiling point, and they further developed a physical relationship. They made oaths of love, vowing that they would only marry each other. One day, they went to a photo studio together to take a picture. On the photo, Li's daughter wrote in her own handwriting: "To my beloved Brother Yufeng, I am willing to fight to the death for you and against my old family. I can only write these words here, but let's see what happens in the future. Your beloved, Li Meilan." However, good times don't last forever, and trouble suddenly arose. This matter was discovered by the girl's father, Li Fengming. Li believed that Sun Yufeng's character was low when he was in his hometown, and that the two families were related. Moreover, Meilan had already been promised to a Mr. Zhang, so this shameless thing could not be done.</p>
<h3>In a Fit of Anger</h3>
<p>He took Meilan to Tianjin this year to stay temporarily. On the one hand, he asked his friend Pan Yuchun to reason with Sun and demand the return of the photos. However, Sun believed that his beautiful marriage was about to be ruined, so he refused to return them. Until 9:50 PM on the 22nd of last month, Sun was on the night shift, so he went to the company to take over. When passing through a dark place near the intersection of Maichihhesituo Road and Aiwenyi Road, a person suddenly held a glass bottle full of nitric acid and splashed it on Sun, then ran away. Sun was not prepared and suffered injuries to his head, face, neck, shoulders, and arms.</p>
<h3>Unconscious</h3>
<p>A patrolling policeman saw this and took Sun to the hospital for treatment. He reported it to the police station, requesting an investigation. After Sun was admitted to the hospital, he was treated by a doctor and soon regained consciousness. Thinking about the incident, he was certain that it was Li Fengming who did it. Therefore, after Sun recovered and was discharged from the hospital the day before yesterday, he went to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to report Li's address and cooperated with Detective Wang Yubin to arrest Li Fengming at No. 157 Xinchang Public House on Jishi'anfei Road.

<p>And the destroyed clothes, he said that he could not see the face clearly at the time because it was dark, etc. When questioned, the defendant Li Fengming said, "Sun is my nephew, and his character has always been bad. After he came to Shanghai on his father's orders, he lived with me. When I learned that he had indecent behavior with my daughter, I scolded him and drove him away, forbidding him to enter my house, which caused him to harbor resentment. I did ask Pan Yuchun to go and retrieve the photos, but he refused to return them. On the evening of June 22, I was dealing with land matters at No. 39 Sichuan Road with Liang and Xie, which can be investigated. This time, I was framed by Sun." According to the witness Pan Yuchun's complaint about the situation of retrieving the photos, Judge Liu Yugui verified the confession. Because the case still needs to be investigated, he ordered a postponement of seven days for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Highway Transportation Expert Returns to China</h3>
<p>Xu Anjun, also known as Zhihao, from Zhejiang Province, graduated from Shanghai University in 1926. In the summer of that year, he went to the United States to study automotive engineering at the Ford Industrial School. Xu, seeing the need for highway transportation and road administration in China, transferred to the University of Michigan, majoring in highway transportation and automobile/traffic. In 1929, he received a master's degree. He then worked at the General Motors Truck Company for a year. Later, he entered the graduate school of the University of Chicago, specializing in traffic and commerce. When Xu was studying in the United States, he emphasized practice, so he had practical research in the automotive traffic industry. He had a paper that was well-received and was introduced as a member of the American Road and Transportation Builders Association (there are only about twenty members in the United States). Xu studied in the United States for seven years and has outstanding knowledge. He recently returned to China and will definitely contribute to the highway transportation industry in the future.</p>
<h3>Commercial Press Creates Holiday Homework Books</h3>
<p>Elementary school holiday homework often lacks appropriate materials. Summer holidays are long, and many places temporarily run summer schools, which also suffer from a lack of suitable textbooks. To meet the needs of all parties, the Commercial Press has created a complete set of twelve elementary school holiday homework books, one for each holiday for six years. The content is entirely based on the latest curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education, combining Chinese, arithmetic, social studies, natural science, civics, hygiene, labor, art, and other subjects into one book. This type of compilation is best suited for short-term teaching during holidays. The editing method focuses on children's self-directed learning. Children who do not attend holiday tutoring schools but study at home only need a little guidance from their parents or teachers, and there is no difficulty in using the books. The allocation of materials in each subject emphasizes both review and remedial instruction, which is not only more enjoyable than reviewing old books but also allows children to acquire a lot of new knowledge and make progress in their studies. It is truly a new contribution to remedial education. The books for the upper and lower semesters of the fourth and fifth grades have been published, and the books for the sixth grade will also be published soon.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Injures Petitioner</h3>
<p>Zhou Youren and Mei Youshou, two dismissed workers from the Fourth Branch of a factory on Qu Zhenren Road in Nanshi, went to the factory around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday to petition. The factory's security guard, Officer Xu, prevented them from entering, and an argument ensued. During the dispute, a coppersmith named Qin Zaiqu (age 26, from Gaoyou) came out to mediate. For some reason, Officer Xu suddenly fired four shots, hitting Qin in the vital part of his flank, causing him to fall to the ground immediately with profuse bleeding. The factory urgently reported the incident to the Second District Headquarters by telephone. Upon hearing the news, District Chief Jin rushed to the scene and immediately sent Qin to the hospital. He also detained Officer Xu. However, Qin died at 3:00 PM yesterday due to the seriousness of his injuries. District Chief Jin reported the incident to the director and informed the local headman to report to the local court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Pudong Electric Company Requests Police Protection for Gaoqiao Seaside Line</h3>
<p>The Gaoqiao Seaside has excellent scenery. Recently, businessmen have contracted to run seaside hotels and seaside bathing beaches there to meet the needs of citizens seeking refuge from the summer heat. The Pudong Electric Company has specifically erected poles and laid lines along the newly rebuilt Haigao Road from the Gaoqiao Town bus station to connect the electricity. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 PM on the 8th of this month, the electricity suddenly went out. The company sent craftsmen to inspect the Haigao Road in detail and found that someone had tied iron wires to bricks and thrown them on the electric wires, causing the wires to short-circuit and create an obstacle. The craftsmen repaired the wires. However, at 10:30 PM on the evening of the 9th, a similar fault occurred again, and the company again sent craftsmen to repair it. These two days happened to be when the hotel opened and business was booming, but they were repeatedly disturbed by hooligans, which is extremely hateful. The company has now sent a letter to the Third Precinct of the Fourth Sub-Bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting them to send police to patrol and arrest the evildoers for severe punishment to deter others. They also request special attention on Saturdays and Sundays, when there are more tourists.</p>

Unexpectedly, at about 2:50 PM yesterday, when the craftsmen were erecting the wooden scaffold, they accidentally touched the upper wooden scaffold that had not been properly placed, causing it to collapse. As a result, six craftsmen below were crushed by the crossbars, most of them injured in the head. The factory reported the incident to the police station, which dispatched an ambulance to send the injured to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Suspect in Six-Year-Old Murder Case Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhao Jinhua, a well-known Huahui gambler from Beiping, used to be a Chinese policeman in the Jing'an Temple Police Station. He loved Peking opera all his life, so he was nicknamed "Opera Fan." After being dismissed for some reason, he specialized in setting up listening devices for Huahui factories, enticing people to gamble and swindling money, earning thousands of gold every month. On July 5, 1928, Zhao Jinhua was shot and killed by accomplices in an ambush in an open space near Gao Lang Temple in Jiangjiabang, Yangshupu. The murderer escaped from the scene. Six years have passed since then, and the murderer is still at large. Wang Jinsheng, a Chinese detective in the Huishan Police Station, arrested two suspects in the case, Zhu Linshan (nicknamed "Little Axe") and Zhang Boliang, both locals, at No. 39 Shenxin Lane, Hejian Road. He confiscated a pistol and seven bullets and sent them to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan attended the Third Criminal Court for further interrogation. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, stated that the case was under postponement and that the investigation revealed that the two defendants, Wei Laoer, who was still at large, and Xu Maonv, who had been arrested and died in prison, were all working as Huahui listeners with the deceased Zhao Jinhua. Because Zhao had embezzled a large amount of gambling money, they harbored deep hatred. Zhu and others discussed shooting him. The police added a charge of privately possessing firearms against the defendant Zhu Linsheng and presented the guns and bullets for inspection. The court ordered the two defendants to be interrogated separately. According to Zhu Linshan's confession, Zhang Boliang, Xu Maonv, Wei Laoer, and others were also present at the time. Zhang fired the first shot at Zhao, followed by Xu Maonv, who rushed to Zhao and fired two more shots, and he immediately fell to the ground. I was only watching in the vicinity and did not participate in the murder. The pistol in the case belonged to my friend Zhang Jinsheng. He asked me to borrow ten silver dollars but failed, so he threw the pistol into the house. Unexpectedly, a few hours later, police detectives came to arrest me, etc. The court ordered Zhang Boliang to be brought to the case for questioning. He completely denied the murder. The judge announced Zhu Linshan's confession and ordered Zhu to confront him in court, but Zhu Boliang still denied it, always being vague. He hired lawyer Fan Gang for defense. Judge Wu ordered them to be remanded to custody because Wei Laoer, who was still at large, had not been apprehended and the circumstances of the case were still serious. He ordered a postponement for further investigation.</p>

<h3>The Eating Problem</h3>
<p>— Huang</p>
<p>What is this "eating problem" in life? That's quite strange.</p>
<p>It is rumored that a person who cultivates the Tao can become an immortal after three years (?) of not eating. In my childhood, I also heard stories of Taoist monks who did not eat. It was said that the cultivator wore a cassock, a Zen hat, clasped his hands, closed his eyes, and chanted "Namo Amitabha Buddha," sitting in a wooden cage in the deep mountains year after year. The wooden cage only had a small round hole just enough for people to provide incense. No matter what, people could not enter or exit from the hole. Children and curious people secretly peeked, trying to see if the cultivator ate or not, but they never discovered it even once. Although no one knew whether the cultivator eventually became an immortal, his not eating seemed to be absolutely certain.</p>
<p>As far as I know, Westerners don't eat much rice either, but they like to eat bread, beef, eggs, and such. Northern Chinese don't eat much rice either, but they must eat large noodles, wotou (cornbread), and bobo (steamed buns). If they don't have those things, they have to eat tree bark and yellow earth. They eat the tree bark and yellow earth until there's nothing left to eat, and only then are they willing to return to heaven and become immortals.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that a cultivator can become an immortal by not eating rice, and ordinary people can also become immortals by having no rice to eat. Different paths, same destination, meaningless. Then, eating rice or not is simply not a problem.</p>
<p>I heard that there are also some people in Western Europe, a modern invention, not wanting to become immortals, but wanting to be ordinary people, able to do what ordinary people want to do, who also don't eat rice, but eat electricity. These are the figures beyond what we call the "three religions and nine streams."</p>
<p>As for China, not to be outdone by Western Europe, recently a kind of people has been invented. They are neither willing to become immortals nor do they like to eat tree bark and yellow earth. They have no rice to eat, but they insist on eating rice. They form groups, surging from here to there, grabbing rice, causing trouble, always wanting to make those who have rice unhappy. It's like a mental illness has broken out. You don't want them to eat, but they insist on eating. So, what exactly are they eating? They are eating "deportation." With this, the place becomes peaceful, and the people in this place are happy.</p>
<p>But what happens after they eat "deportation"? Of course, in that place, they are eating "deportation" again. In the end, they eat "deportation out of the country." They eat "deportation out into the world." But in the end, they still cultivate the Tao and become immortals.</p>
<p>In the human world, the myriad living beings, everyone cultivates the Tao and becomes an immortal, not an ordinary mortal. Or doing another kind of person beyond the "three religions and nine streams," then the world will be peaceful. Not eating is really a good thing.</p>
<p>What is this "eating problem" in life? That's quite strange.</p>
<h3>Nudity and Character Divination</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Shanghai is the first place in China to accept new civilization, like a person's mouth, which eats into the stomach, and then circulates throughout the body. For eighty years, various new civilizations have been introduced into the interior from Shanghai, breaking through the barriers of five thousand years of ancient civilization. Logically speaking, Shanghai should advance daily towards civilization. One should only see the continuous import of new civilization, and there should be no corrupt remnants, and even less should the corrupt forces of the interior be allowed to counterattack Shanghai. However, in reality, it is not so. New civilization is imported, old corruption still remains, and it is indeed counterattacked from the interior. I am currently discovering the practical evidence of both of these contradictions at the same time.</p>
<p>The nude movement spreading from Hong Kong to Shanghai is practical evidence of the import of new civilization. At the same time, from the western end of Xinzha Road to the Tibet Road at the Xinsludge Bridge, a very short stretch of road is lined with a dozen character divination stalls. Almost like the clothing stores on Shilu Road, the furniture stores on Zhili Road, and also a few fortune tellers, who hang a picture of the human body on the wall, which can be counted as a stall. The sidewalk, which has always been quite deserted, has become lively with these dozen stalls. Looking at the stall owners, each one is emaciated, dressed untidily, with no room to trust them to make judgments and resolve doubts. However, in reality, it is not so. Each stall is continuously visited by people who earnestly trust them. If the people living in Shanghai all had a touch of civilization and did not trust them, they would have no room to exist. Because those who trust character divination masters to make judgments, resolve doubts, and point out the way are still in the vast majority, they all recognize that Shanghai can be established in, and they continuously pour in from the interior. Here, we are only talking about the dozen newly opened stalls. As for the whole of Shanghai, there are probably several hundred or even thousands of stalls.</p>
<p>Someone advocates banning the nude movement from entering Shanghai. But no one has paid attention to these hundreds or thousands of character divination stalls that hinder the progress of civilization!</p>
<h3>Strange</h3>
<p>— Ye Yiyuan</p>
<p>It is strange that many stores in the city rely on the power of advertising and publicity to conduct their business. Yet only the stores that sell opium do not need publicity or advertising, and can still enable customers to know and come to buy quietly.</p>
<p>It is strange that many stores in Shanghai are constantly hanging the banners of "big sale," "big sacrifice," and "twenty-one days!"</p>
<p>It is strange that when a man inadvertently hears a woman's voice, or when a woman walks past him, he will always turn his head to look.</p>
<p>It is strange that ordinary great philanthropists and great educators shout about saving the country, but they cannot pay attention to the countless out-of-school children in the streets and alleys. Even more, they cannot educate many future strong men to save the country from these countless out-of-school children!</p>
<p>It is strange that the reward of an elementary school teacher who bears a heavy responsibility is not as good as that of a worker, a servant, or a beggar.</p>
<p>It is strange that if the purpose of establishing schools is for education for education's sake, then why are there no places of education in the remote villages and slums? Is it that there are no children there?</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 11: She Bows Her Head and Agrees to Marriage, Her Affectionate Feelings Pulse; The Soldiers Are Joyful</p>
<p>Although Madam Huang's ears were listening to what she was saying, her eyes were naturally fixed completely on Guizhi. Guizhi pressed her hands on her knees, looking down at her hands, saying nothing. Madam Huang naturally understood Jiang's intention very well. She herself was very willing, but she didn't know what the girl meant, so Jiang's words were always irrelevant, and when she spoke, her attitude was very uneasy, as if she was afraid that speaking out would cause the girl's opposition. Madam Huang knew that this key point was completely drawn to Guizhi, so she walked towards Guizhi and sat next to her chair, then pressed her hand on Guizhi's hand and said: Big girl, you can say whatever you want. If you are willing, then there is nothing. If you are unwilling, talking and talking, we keep talking, how annoying that would be. Guizhi lowered her head, her face inevitably red, and being told this, she didn't know what to do. Now that Madam Huang said the word "annoying," this made it impossible for her to remain silent, so she deliberately put on a stern face and said: Oh! You are making fun of me, how dare we be? Madam Huang laughed: Saying it like this, you are not opposed, then, let's talk down this way. What do you think? Guizhi heard it, but did not make a sound. Madam Huang said: Say it! What exactly? As she spoke, she reached out and gently patted Guizhi on the shoulder. When Jiang looked at Manying, Manying nodded repeatedly twice. Madam Huang laughed: Like this, there probably won't be a problem. Tomorrow, you send a quick letter to Xiyuan, and let Little Tian send a message to Company Commander Zhao, so that he can also feel relieved. As long as both families are willing, this matter is settled, as for finishing those things, it doesn't matter these few days. Manying said: You are wrong to say that. You say, if both families are willing, that counts as settled, that is our view. According to the person involved, if it is not finished, they will not feel at ease. (127)</p>
<h3>Red Pills</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>The staple food of ordinary people is rice, and the staple food of addicts is also rice. Ordinary people eat "white rice," and addicts also eat "white rice," but at the same time, they also eat "black rice." It is said that the taste of "black rice" is better than "white rice." "White rice" can only repair the five internal organs, while "black rice" goes a step further, opening the seven orifices and eighteen openings. Therefore, "black rice" is also called "Fushou Paste" (opium).</p>
<p>"White rice" is not a blessing that everyone can eat. Just taking Shanghai as an example, at least several tens of percentages of comrades who do not wear long gowns are using sesame cakes, fried dough sticks, fried tofu, and vermicelli as their three meals a day. "Black rice" is also like this. It is not a blessing that everyone can eat. The sesame cakes and fried dough sticks in black rice are said to be "red pills," which those in the know call "red beads."</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers often use large-character headlines to publish important news such as "investigating red pill institutions" and "busting red pill dens," which is enough to show how deeply "red pills" are favored by people.</p>
<p>According to those who smoke "red pills," smoking opium is aristocratic. Currently, without a bulging wallet, one can't expect to lie down comfortably, exhaling clouds and exhaling fog. Only the "red beads" can make the snot and tears that have been mobilized immediately demobilize with a dozen or so coins in hand. Just like eating "white rice," going to a small restaurant, three pieces of salty pork and tofu, a small bowl of Yangchun noodles, including the seating fee, it also costs two hundred and eighty big coins. Two sesame cakes and two fried dough sticks, when American wheat arrives, might not even cost twelve coins.</p>
<p>Those who smoke "red pills" progress so quickly that it's unbelievable. The so-called "progress" means that the addiction increases daily and becomes more prosperous. For example, smoking thirty pills is enough on the first day. On the second day, it's best to add five pills. On the third day, you have to smoke forty pills, or you will feel very uncomfortable in your heart. "No progress without retreat" is the slogan of smokers. Therefore, "red pill manufacturers" have to "expand their business" and "increase production."</p>
<p>One day, I asked a "red pill consumer": I heard that those who consume "red pills" cannot escape the gate of hell in less than ten years. Is that true? He said humorously, "Anyway, without smoking 'red pills,' you can't even survive three days."</p>
<p>Travel Notes</p>
<h3>Travel Notes on the World's Fair (1)</h3>
<p>— Huang Jueming</p>
<p>Editor's note: After Mr. Huang Jueming obtained a Master of Education from the University of the Philippines in 1931, he went to the Teachers College of Columbia University in the United States to specialize in educational psychology. He obtained a diploma in educational psychology from the college. This time when he returned home, he passed through Chicago. On the day of the opening of the World's Fair, he stayed in Chicago for two days to visit. He described what he saw below to share with the people of our country.</p>
<p>(1) Overview</p>
<p>The World's Fair was initiated by the citizens of Chicago in the United States, inviting various countries to join, to commemorate the city's centennial progress. The dates are from May 27 to November 1. The location is on the shore of Lake Michigan in Chicago City. The area is 424 acres in circumference. It cost more than 10 million gold dollars. It was generally donated by the initiators and maintainers of the association, without receiving a single cent of subsidy from the central and provincial governments. Unlike the previous three expositions in 1893, 1904, and 1915, which all received government funding of at least seven or eight million yuan, and as much as more than ten million yuan. The association began preparing in February 1928. On the opening day of this year, there were still several displays that were not open to the public. The scale is unimaginable.</p>
<p>The slogan of the fair is "Century of Progress." The purpose is to let visitors know the inventions of science, the applications of industry, and the enjoyment of mankind in the last century (1833-1933). The constructed display buildings mostly have no windows, and the air and light inside are all supplied by the machine reputation.</p>
<p>(2) Science Exhibition Hall</p>
<p>Because I have a special interest in science, and it is also the most important point of the fair, I went to the Science Exhibition Hall (Figure 1) to visit first. The shape of the hall is like the English letter U. It is three acres in size. Inside, there are seven types of achievements in mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and medicine, which are called basic sciences. Except for astronomy, which is listed separately in the planetarium, the other six types are displayed here.</p>
<p>(1) The mathematics department displays many calculation machines and performs algorithms. It allows viewers to understand how mathematics is applied to daily life. The deeper ones show how trigonometry is applied to navigation, and how the standard time of each part of the earth is calculated. Deeper ones, such as Michelson's machine for determining the speed of light, Golron's machine for creating normal states and curves, and many other machines, even though the people in charge explained them in simple terms, are still very difficult for ordinary people to understand.</p>
<p>(2) Physics Department: Here, viewers can answer the following questions: How can air in rubber tires withstand heavy pressure? How does the combination of hot steam and hot water generate pressure? How does electricity generate freezing power in refrigerators? How is sound generated and propagated? How do sound movies make sound? How are telescopes and microscopes constructed? How is light reflected and how is it refracted? How do glasses correct vision? How can we know that the length of a light wave is twenty millionths of an inch? Moreover, thanks to science, the naked eye can see the most microscopic material components such as electrons and Protons here. The penetrating power of X-rays is also seen in this section.</p>
<p>Next to the physics department, in a large room, is displayed the steel ball that ocean explorer William Beebe rode to descend half a mile into the ocean and the balloon that air explorer Auguste Piccard rode to ascend ten miles into the air. At the southern end of this room are displayed the ninety-three chemical molecules that make up the earth.</p>

<p>Educational News Highlights</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Principals Seek a Way Out for Students Who Failed One Subject in the Joint Examination</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Province held a joint middle school examination this year. It is heard that Shanghai Middle School ranked first in average scores, followed by Suzhou Middle School and Yangzhou Middle School. The principals of middle schools throughout Jiangsu Province, in their position as educational administrators, strongly agree with the joint examination. However, they believe that for students who pass all other subjects but fail only one subject, although they are required to retake the course, they are neither allowed to take the university entrance examination nor can they repeat a grade for one subject. Such students have nowhere to turn. From the perspective of running education theory, this is not the way of education. The principals of each school are seeking a way out for students who failed one subject. They have specially prepared a document to be submitted to the Ministry of Education through the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, and have recommended middle school principals Zheng Tonghe, Cao Chu, etc. to go to the Ministry of Education on the 10th to present everything in person. Generally, they request the Ministry of Education not to issue diplomas to students who have only failed one subject, and to allow them to take the university entrance examination. If they are admitted, after one semester, if the one subject they failed in the supplementary examination is still not passed, they will be disciplined. This does not seem to be just for a lack of a subject, but to abandon years of study. It is indeed a way to provide relief. It is heard that Zheng Tonghe and others arrived at the Ministry of Education at 12:00 noon on the 10th to contact Dai Yingguan, Section Chief of the Department of General Education, etc. Dai agreed to forward the request to the Minister for consideration.</p>

Sixty-four people failed three or more subjects and should repeat a grade. This list was announced yesterday.</p>

<h3>Municipal Qualification Examination Starts Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Higher Level: 3 Days, Ordinary Level: 2 Days</p>
<p>Examination Venue: Wuben Girls' Middle School</p>
<p>The municipal higher and ordinary qualification examinations are scheduled to begin tomorrow. The schedule and location have been determined by the Examination Committee, and are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Higher Level Examination</h3>
<p>Day 1 (13th): Examine Higher Levels 1, 2, and 3 Chinese, Chinese and Foreign Geography, Higher Level 5 Advanced Mathematics, Advanced Physics; Day 2 (14th): Higher Levels 1, 2, and 3 Chinese and Foreign History, Higher Levels 1 and 2 Political Science, Higher Level 3 History of Education, Higher Level 5 Advanced Chemistry, Foreign Language; Day 3 (15th): Higher Level 1 Comparative Constitution, Administrative Law, Economics, Higher Level 2 Civil Law, Criminal Law, Higher Level 3 Principles of Education, Educational Administration.</p>

<h3>Examination Venue</h3>
<p>At Wuben Girls' Middle School on Huangjiaque Road. All test permits will be issued at the test site at 8:00 AM on the 13th for the Higher Level and at 8:00 AM on the 16th for the Ordinary Level. All examinees must bring their own test supplies and arrive at the venue on time to take the test.</p>
<h3>Important Points to Note for the Qualification Examination</h3>
<p>Passes in Common Subjects Are Exempt from Retesting</p>
<p>Passed Subjects Can Be Combined for Calculation</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau previously received Order No. 220 from the Selection Committee of the Municipal Government, which stated that Pan Guozhu had submitted a report stating that he had taken the examination of the second category of various subjects at the Anhui Higher Qualification Examination Committee in accordance with the Qualification Examination Regulations and obtained certificates of passing in various subjects. Now, it is heard that the ordinary administrative personnel examination is scheduled to be held in September, and the judicial officer examination was conducted last year. It is now planned to first take the ordinary administrative personnel examination. According to the qualification regulations, except for economics, comparative constitution, and administrative law, which are not available in the second category, if one wants to take the ordinary administration exam, it is natural to make up the qualification. The first and second types share subjects such as Chinese and foreign history, Chinese and foreign geography. The previous qualification was also the same test question. Should one be exempted from re-qualification if they have already qualified in the second type qualification? This should be requested. Also, assuming that a candidate in the first type of qualification examination has not passed one subject, and that subject is shared by both the first and second types (such as political science, geography, etc.), if they have qualified in the first type qualification, can the two types of certificates be combined for verification when taking the judicial officer examination in the future? This should be requested. The above two points have not been tentatively proposed. A document is prepared and submitted for review. Please give instructions to follow, etc. Based on this, the Committee's interpretation in the 20th year has been examined, where administrative personnel have passed the qualification examination, and when planning to take the judicial officer examination, it is only necessary to make up the subjects not examined during the administrative personnel qualification examination. For those who have passed the common subjects in the two qualification examinations, they should be allowed to re-examine according to the case. Moreover, if a candidate has taken several types of qualification examinations before and after, and the number of subjects passed totals enough for a certain type of qualification examination, they can be combined for calculation as a full qualification. Based on the aforementioned situation, in addition to approving and instructing the association to verify the eligibility to take the examination, the relevant points to note for handling the qualification examination are consulted and transferred to the Qualification Examination Committee for uniform notice.</p>
<h3>New Atmosphere at Guoguang Middle School</h3>
<p>The authorities of Guoguang Middle School on Yuyuan Road have realized that students lack opportunities for learning and reference. After a meeting of the school affairs committee, it was presented to the chairman and school director for assistance, providing huge sums of money, adding an opportunity to experiment with instruments and the national inspection. Ba Gong has contacted the scientific establishment and various bookstores and arranged for delivery to the school soon. It is heard that on the faculty side, in addition to the original dozen or so faculty members, Ms. Li Yumei, a Bachelor of Arts graduate of Guanghua University, has recently been hired to serve as a female student instructor.</p>

<h3>Understanding</h3>
<p>— Zhou Buzhai</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a pervasive call for "understanding," from interpersonal relationships to international exchanges. We seek understanding from others externally, and we seek understanding internally as well. At the same time, having achieved external understanding, we must also achieve internal understanding; having achieved internal understanding, we can then achieve external understanding. How important and difficult is understanding!</p>
<p>Although the aspects of understanding may differ, the goal is always the same: peace. In other words, it is to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>The true essence of understanding lies in "people knowing each other, valuing the knowledge of each other's hearts." Specifically, it means that one should not be overly critical of others and that one should recognize that others may have their own difficulties or hidden pains. In this way, everyone benefits, and things are "mutually satisfactory." Therefore, the ultimate stage of understanding is "perfect harmony in the heart." Otherwise, "no one understands me," which is a truly unfortunate thing.</p>
<p>Understanding appears to be mutual, but in reality, it is often one-sided. Those who seek understanding often fail to understand others, prevent others from understanding them, and sometimes even fail to understand themselves. For example, Yuan Shikai fabricated public opinion in the hope of being understood. However, fabricating public opinion clearly violates public opinion, indicating a lack of understanding of the people. Not wanting to follow public opinion but resorting to fabricating it prevents others from understanding him. The very act of fabricating public opinion shows that he knew its importance, and fabricating it despite this knowledge shows that he did not understand himself. If one does not understand others, prevents others from understanding, and does not understand oneself, then who understands whom? Who does not want to be understood by whom? The very act of seeking understanding is inherently contradictory, indicating a lack of understanding. If one can "know others," enable "others to know," and also "know oneself," who needs to understand whom? Who does not understand whom? Understanding is often one-sided, the lack of seeking for understanding is one-sided and not one-sided.</p>
<p>Some believe that the Chinese lack a spirit of understanding, which is the root of all disputes. However, it is precisely because we seek understanding in everything that we often fail to achieve it. And yet, after failing to achieve understanding in everything, we often end up understanding everything. The Chinese people have long suffered from the losses caused by understanding. This is naturally not only a one-sided understanding but also an understanding limited in scope.</p>
<h3>Reading the Inaugural Issue of "Literature"</h3>
<p>— Another Realm</p>
<p>Thinking of the hardships these thirty-odd authors endured writing these articles almost makes me hesitant to make any comments here. To finish reading the months of labor of dozens of people in just one day (naturally, adding the hardships of the printers), and then casually add a comment of "good" or "bad," I think is the most cruel thing. This is the eternal discord between readers and authors, and the responsibility naturally lies with the readers.</p>
<p>Therefore, I do not wish to appear in the position of a critic, as this might alleviate some of the burden.</p>
<p>Now, to observe the content of a purely literary magazine, the important thing is the creation it contains because the present is a time of violent storms. If a purely literary magazine cannot reflect this era vividly, it is undoubtedly of little value. Several literary magazines in Beiping do not seem to have noticed this point, but the editors of "Literature" have grasped it.</p>
<p>Now is a time when men of letters are extremely distressed. As long as they are not those who make a living by wielding the sword, everyone wants to use literature as a tool for expressing grievances and revolution. The editors of "Literature" declared that the content of their magazine is "mixed," but after reading the entire book, we felt a unified atmosphere, which is the resentment and protest against the heavy pressure of the times.</p>
<p>I naturally read the ten works of creation among them with more attention, but I could not help but have some feelings about them. The Chinese New Literature Movement has only been around for thirteen or fourteen years, and writers have been engaged in creation for at most eleven or twelve years. Compared with the thirty or forty years of creative activities of foreign writers, they are not yet considered old writers, but I feel as if the creative power of Chinese writers ages too easily. They often cannot give newcomers the excitement of "the older, the wiser," and narrow the scope of creation to trivial matters around them. They naturally also want to express this era, but few can arouse readers' feelings of reality. This answer can only be found in the lives of the writers. Here, the works of several new writers show their vigorous creative power and can give readers a little more sense of resonance. However, I have some very bad feelings about the two debut works "China in May" and "Puji." The lack of content in "China in May" really exceeds even Mu Shiying's "People in Five Nightclubs." I can only say it is boring; "Puji" is also an extremely meaningless thing and cannot be considered literary creation, but rather a record of customs. I think that debut works by unknown writers should be promoted, but they should first be encouraged from the point of view of having content and social significance. This is the requirement given to us by the times. I wonder what the editors of "Literature" think?</p>
<p>The inaugural issue contains six articles soliciting essays on "The Historical Significance of the May Fourth Literary Movement" from the society. This is really a difficult topic. People who do this topic must have considerable research on the theory of social science, be familiar with the economic history of China, and naturally have a materialistic historical understanding of Chinese literary history. The focus of this topic is clearly on the social foundation of the May Fourth Literary Movement and the impact of this movement on later generations. However, how can it be explained clearly in a short one or two thousand words! Therefore, the results are not very good. Some forgot the historical significance, some only talked about the social foundation of this movement, some did not place this movement on a certain social foundation, and some mixed it up with the anti-feudal movement, which was not a bourgeois movement. From this, it can also be seen that Chinese literati still do not have a sufficient understanding of the era in which they live.</p>
<p>Lu Xun's article "More on 'The Third Kind of Person'" is short and concise. In addition to the importance and simplicity of the meaning, his old man's writing style is also extremely humorous.</p>
<p>The appearance of "Literature" is naturally not accidental. From its "Society Talk," it can be known that it is a voice of resistance under the heavy pressure of the times. The "Society Talk" of the publication says: "We, this group of people丨丨naturally have a common vision丨丨丨to the road of light. Everything that is enough to hinder this road of light, whether it is an individual, a group, a system, or an ideology, we must regard it as our enemy丨丨丨to curse it, punish it, and eliminate it." I and other readers of "Literature" will use this to expect its progress!</p>
<p>Writing ramblingly, I still cannot avoid the plea of "having high aspirations but low abilities."</p>
<h3>New Words on Old Books</h3>
<p>— Feng Wu</p>
<p>㈥</p>
<p>The Kangxi Emperor in Beijing wanted to eat perch from the Yangtze River, 2,500 miles away. So, his subjects were busy fishing and offering perch as tribute. According to Zhang Nenglin, the Shandong Surveillance Commissioner at the time:</p>
<p>I secretly estimate that perch is produced in the Yangtze River in the south of the Yangtze River. Reaching the capital, the journey is more than two thousand five hundred miles. The tribute officials set up a post every thirty miles, erecting flagpoles. Banners are hung during the day, and lanterns are hung at night. In total, more than 3,000 horses and thousands of laborers are prepared. The mountain roads in the eastern province are rugged. I have seen officials in various prefectures and counties supervise laborers to transport wood to build bridges, carve stones to repair roads, and rush day and night, fearing that a horse might stumble and cause serious reprimands. Moreover, the weather is hot, and the nature of perch cannot last long... Officials and civilians in the three provinces, just for a single food item, are alarmed and exhausted, officials abandon their duties, and civilians abandon their farming...</p>
<p>Zhang Nenglin (Feng Wu's note: This public official is also a fish, and it is appropriate to plead for his own kind) believes that this is not feasible and requests exemption from tribute. From this point of view, causing turmoil for eating one or two fish is far different from the current situation of merely building one or two roads to return home in glory and collecting a little extra tax. Civilization is ultimately something that only exists in modern times. Was that time a dark age? As I write this, I really want to offer a heartfelt prayer, hoping that all the officials will live ten thousand years.</p>
<h3>Patient of Asthenia</h3>
<p>— Yi Ming</p>
<p>Asthenia is also a very common disease of the times. People who suffer from this disease are mostly because their bodies are too weak. Because their nerve sensations are exceptionally sensitive, they not only have dreams at night, but also daydreams during the day. The most special thing is that they often have blurred vision. Clearly, there is a tree in front of them, but they treat it as a big forest; clearly, there are only one or two people in front of them, but in their eyes, they transform into a large group, and they will shout out even more. And because they are probably afraid that these one or two people will dissolve into the group of people they fear, we only hear them stamping their feet and shouting in frustration...</p>
<p>"So-and-so is surrounded!"</p>
<p>"So-and-so thing is monopolized!"</p>
<p>In fact, everything is as it is. Nothing has been monopolized by a certain group of people, and no one has been surrounded. It is because their own bodies are too poor, and as a result of dizziness and blurred vision, many illusions will be created in their eyes due to psychological effects. In front of the illusions they create themselves, they themselves become afraid. They shrink into a ball in fright while shouting frantically.</p>
<p>They believe that such frantic shouting can have a dual effect: First, their shouting may scare away the dark mass in front of them. Then, that person may sing the praises of his merit in driving away this group of people and throw himself at his feet, and then follow him to shout together. Otherwise, even if the first move fails, this sharp shouting can at least give that person a kind of intimidation, a kind of warning. Naturally, in a few days, he will break out of the "siege."</p>
<p>But what is the reality? Their frantic shouting not only fails to achieve this imagined effect but, on the contrary, because of their own cowardly performance, makes people understand even more that these people are all suffering from asthenia. Their own bodies have entered a period when they must enter a sanatorium or a dissection room. They are so nervous that they cannot sleep peacefully for a moment. Therefore, as soon as they open their eyes, they only see a group of people in the east and a group of people in the west. What other methods can they think of besides shouting frantically as a result of their inner fear of their own destruction?</p>
<p>These patients of asthenia should still go to a sanatorium to seek the restoration of their own health. Frantic shouting is of no help.</p>
<h3>Dream of the Orthodox Succession</h3>
<p>— Da Yi</p>
<p>Alas! The human heart is perilous, the moral heart is subtle, be refined, be single-minded, and sincerely hold the mean. This is the Dao, the great Dao of the world. Yao passed it on to Shun, Shun passed it on to Yu, Yu passed it on to Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou, and the Duke of Zhou passed it on to Confucius. Confucius followed Yao and Shun, and patterned himself after Wen and Wu, and especially admired the Duke of Zhou. The Duke of Zhou therefore entered his dreams, and when he declined, there was the deception of not dreaming of the Duke of Zhou for a long time. This is the first act of the dream of the orthodox succession. Bian Shao of the Later Han Dynasty took a nap during the day. His disciples mocked him privately, saying, Bian Xiaoxian, with a large belly, is lazy to read and only wants to sleep. Shao secretly heard this and replied, Bian is the surname, Xiao is the courtesy name, the big belly is a container of the Five Classics. I just want to sleep to think over classical matters. Sleeping and dreaming with the Duke of Zhou, silently agreeing with Confucius. The teacher can be mocked, what classic records is this from? He only knows that Bian, the fat man who naps during the day, also claims to communicate with the Duke of Zhou in his sleep and agree with Confucius. This is the second act of the dream of the orthodox succession. There were the most corrupt scholars in the Ming Dynasty, the wind of lecturing was the strongest, and the views of factions were also the deepest. Everyone took it upon themselves to shoulder this orthodox succession. Therefore, there were many who dreamed of the orthodox succession. Wu Yu's Kangzhai Anthology Daily Record often recorded his dreams of King Wen, Confucius, and Zhu Xi. For example, it says that he dreamed of Confucius and King Wen in the year of Yisi, and visited Zhu Xi on the first day of the third month of Bingzi. On the night of the twenty-fifth of May, he dreamed of Confucius' grandson, who came to visit him on Confucius' orders. After a meal in the year of Xinyi, he was drowsy and dreamed that Zhu Xi and his son came to visit. He also claimed that his wife dreamed of an old man carrying two followers when she returned home after planting bamboo in her new house, saying that it was Confucius who came to visit. Dream or dream? There are ghosts, there are ghosts. This is the third act of the dream of the orthodox succession. Using the structure of opera to compare it, it has reached its climax. Yang Jiesheng wrote his own chronicle, recording that he learned music theory from Han Bangqi and dreamed of Yu Shun at night. This is the fourth act of the dream of the orthodox succession. As for Luo Lun's One Peak Collection of Dream Manuscripts, in two volumes, the words recording dreams reach more than three hundred poems, which are absurd and vague and cannot be investigated. This is the fifth act of the dream of the orthodox succession. Is a farce about to end with this random string of events? However, not yet. Even if there are no saints today, the orthodox succession of saints passing on to saints can also be passed on to the worthy. But why must today's new historians say that Yao and Shun did not exist, and that Yu was a kind of reptile, shocking and shattering the dream of the orthodox succession of great sages?</p>
<h3>Ordinary Things in Creating Novels (9)</h3>
<p>— Dan Guosun</p>
<p>However, the situation of that lunch that day was different from before. The heads were still as numerous, and the voices were not as loud. It was as if there was a common martial law in the spirit, restricting those men, women, old and young, causing everyone to almost look at each other with dull eyes. This situation means that "disaster is imminent!" However, what exactly is this disaster?</p>
<p>Is the so-called disaster the same as the Goryeo's failure? Not so. These men and women will never consider this matter, and perhaps few people know what Goryeo is! Where exactly is it! Then, is it the enemy's planes? Not so. They have become accustomed to them recently, and they also know that the enemy's planes would never dare to disturb the imperialists' concessions! Then, perhaps they are considering the possibility of a food shortage? Not so. They have long known that Shanghai's rice depends on Annam. Although Zhabei is fighting with the enemy, Annam rice is still imported, and they themselves will not be short of money! It can be seen that the so-called "disaster" is simply another matter!</p>
<p>These men and women all escaped from the two areas of Hongkou or Nanshi. In terms of relationship, they are either relatives of Bo Tang or from Bo Tang's family. In terms of occupation, they are either small businessmen or small landlords who live in concession houses and eat rural land rent. In general, they are all petty bourgeoisie. On ordinary days, they have already regarded Bo Tang as a reliable support in times of emergency. Now that they are in distress, they naturally want to share Bo Tang's worries and joys because Bo Tang and his wife generously shared food and clothing with them. That morning, they heard the so-called rumors from the factory from Pei Yu's mouth. The castles in the air in Pei Yu's mouth were of course only</p>
<p>relatively high, but when they reached their ears, even higher outlines emerged. Therefore, they thought that this support might be shaken in this way. Therefore, they could not but express a kind of silence, whether out of politeness or practicality. However, in reality, Bo Tang did not regard the so-called rumors as terrible, but Pei Yu regarded them as terrible. Pei Yu regarded them as terrible, but these men and women regarded them as a kind of terror even more. Therefore, within five or six hours in the morning, not hearing the news from the factory, as well as the whereabouts of the workers' representatives and Zhang Zhiguang, they all believed that the seriousness of the incident was becoming more and more intense and that disaster was imminent.</p>
<p>In this way, waiting until around four o'clock, there was still no news. In the meantime, several times, the telephone bell rang occasionally, and Pei Yu was seen rushing to the phone. After she said two or three sentences, Bo Tang leisurely strolled over. But the results were not conversations within the issue. Therefore, from more than eight o'clock in the morning to the afternoon, the situation did not make much progress. At four o'clock, suddenly the postman delivered two express letters in succession.</p>
<p>The first letter was sent by Shou Zichun. After opening it, it was found to be an invitation, inviting Bo Tang to his house for dinner at 6 pm tomorrow. Bo Tang looked at it and threw it on the table casually. Pei Yu said forcefully as if she was upset:</p>
<p>'In times like these, he still sends express letters to invite guests. This person is really numb! Bo Tang, you don't have to go......'</p>

<h3>Many Unfavorable External News, Gold Market High but Still Low</h3>
<p>Decline Not Weak, 19.2 Yuan</p>
<p>Another New Low Price of 816.5 Yuan The gold market yesterday avoided rising and falling sharply, making it difficult to act. Although the market fell in the morning, it still rose, which was a strong potential to cover short positions. In the afternoon, people were suddenly panicked, and the sharp sell-off was extremely fast. The major firm, Fuchang, bravely sold out (a total of 1,500 to 1,600 taels in the morning and afternoon), which made buyers helpless. In the early morning, the price of British silver fell, while American silver rose instead. The exchange rate continued to rise sharply. The forward silver price fell slightly but not much. American cotton even rose 50 points, and American wheat also rose by more than one cent. Stock prices rose and fell. The gross profit immediately retreated. After the opening, the domestic market suddenly became strong and low. HSBC initially quoted a British discount of 1.25 and an American gain of 0.25. Then, it gradually stabilized. Finally, it suddenly rose because Reuters reported that French Finance Minister Pon Lai was expected to discuss currency stability with gold-using countries in the United States. Covering short positions was urgent again. HSBC changed its quotation to a British discount of 0.25 and an American gain of 0.5 yuan. The bank's supply was slightly tired. In the afternoon, Fuchang sold heavily off-market and it was rumored that the monetary committee of the economic conference supported raising the price of silver to 5.2 yuan. People were suddenly nervous, and soon created a new low price of 816.5 yuan. The premium was 195 yuan. Now, let's record the market situation for the day.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 829.8 yuan, a decrease of 7.9 yuan from the previous closing. The opening price of goods was the same. The exchange market opened with British tight and American loose. The selling price for the near term was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 875, and the American exchange rate was 29.125 yuan. Hengyu, Yifeng, Yongzhao, Fengchang, Zhifeng, Yongda, Xingyong, Dacheng, Zhengchang, and others sold taels together. The exchange market was extremely strong. Mitsui blocked the August US dollar at 3.125 yuan, and the October price of 75 was difficult to sell, so it retreated from 0.2 yuan to 24 yuan. Zhengjin ate the October US dollar at 8.125 yuan, which could slightly support it, but soon even 875 lacked buyers. Dacheng, Daxing, Yonghengxing, Yuanmao Yong, and others sold again, and it fell to 1.8 yuan. Zhengchang, Qianchang, Xiang, and others made slight purchases. McAlister also picked up the October US dollar at 875 and gradually rebounded. HSBC quoted a small British discount of 1.25 and an American gain of 0.25. Although Bingxing sold, it was bought by goods such as Richang and Hengxing, and it hovered around 4 yuan. After entering, the October US dollar at 8.125 yuan was once difficult to settle. Fuyu Yuanmao advanced to 6 yuan. Yuansheng Yong Dacheng sold to 3.3 yuan. Shanghai ate the October US dollar at 875 and 8.125 yuan, and then rose again. Fuchang Yuanmao Yong Yuanheng Daxing Yong and others successively bought, rising to 7 yuan and then retreating. After entering, covering short positions suddenly rose. Qianchang Xiang Yuansheng Yong Fuyu Daxing Yong Dacheng Yuanmao all advanced. The foreign telegram was slightly favorable, and people's hearts were boosted. The October US dollar at 5.625 yuan was difficult to settle and rose to 33.5 yuan. Wahbi sold 1.875 in August, and Pangen sold 5.625 in October. The Dalian gang and Fuyu Hengxing sold slightly, falling to 0.05 yuan. Without similar HSBC quoting news that the British discount was changed to 0.25 and the American gain was changed to a small 0.5 yuan, the market was greatly boosted. Richang Dacheng Yuanmao Yong Hongli Zhifeng Yong Zhengchang Shunli actively purchased, and it rose to 4.8 yuan. Yongfeng Hengyu Yuankangxiang sold to 1.8 yuan. Wahbi also sold 0.5 yuan in October. Daxing Yong Tongyi Dacheng's buying interest was still strong, rising to 35 yuan. Scattered accounts were slightly sold. The noon closing was 833.3 yuan. The goods were auctioned at 3 yuan and continued to retreat to 2 yuan after closing, because Fuchang came up and sold 700 taels heavily, and the market was difficult to support.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Fuchang came out immediately off-market, and the opening retreated to 29 yuan. The goods opened at 7.5 yuan. Fuchang Hengyu (on behalf of Fuchang), Daxing Yong Yuanxing Yong Fuyu competed to sell. The exchange rate of the October US dollar had hardened from 625 to 75, and fell to 22.5 yuan. The Bombay telegram reported a drop of 4 anna. Zhaofeng Chang Tongyi Yifeng Yong Bingxing Heng and Lianmai bought in unison. Zhengjin ate the October US dollar at 75 and gradually rebounded to 26.8 yuan. Without resembling the people's terrified mood, before long the November US dollar at 0625 was difficult to sell. Daxing Yong Hengyu Qianchang Yuansheng Yong Dacheng Yuanxing Yong and others sold again, breaking the 20 yuan mark and falling to 18.5 yuan. Hengyu Fuyu slightly accepted it at a low price. McAlister accepted the October US dollar at 9375 and rebounded to 22 yuan. A little while ago, the November US dollar at 125 also lacked buyers. Daxing Yong Dacheng Yuanmao Yong Richang repeatedly sold taels, and it fell to 16.5 yuan. After that, Yuankangxiang actively purchased, Hengxing Zhifeng Yong Hengyu Fuchang also accepted, and it rose to 20 yuan. Zhifeng Yong Bingxing Yuanmao Yong came to sell again, and the closing still retreated to 818.2 yuan. After closing, Yuankangxiang Daxing Yong once advanced to 30 yuan, while the goods were auctioned at 18 yuan. Hengxing advanced and then came out again, and no one responded. Finally, it retreated to 18 yuan. It was found that the highest price of the day was 835 yuan, and the lowest was 816.5 yuan, with a fluctuation of 18.5 yuan. As a result, it fell sharply by 19.2 yuan compared with the previous closing.</p>
<p>The quoted price was that the American exchange rate quoted by HSBC Bank was reduced by 25, to 28.25 yuan. The combined standard gold price was 849.56 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 31 yuan, which was 26 yuan stronger than the previous closing. The registered price for this month was 843 yuan, and for August it was 833 yuan. The water supplement in the morning was 843 yuan. In the afternoon, the registered price for this month was 828 yuan, and for August it was 818 yuan. The premium was 195 yuan. The actual transaction should be added 210 yuan, added 220 yuan for two or three days of delivery, sold by Yingfeng Heng to small money houses, only 40 taels, but the buyer still needs this month's taels, still leaving 2,597 taels.</p>
<p>Although the transactions in the market are elusive, each number has no definite purpose. In summary, Hengxing Shunli Wanxing Ruikang Yuanmao Tongyi Cuitai Fuyu Yuankangxiang Hengtai Richang and others were all buyers. Fuchang Hengyu Yuanxing Yong Dacheng Bingxing Daxing Yong Chunyuan Yong Yongfeng and others all came out. Fuchang issued a total of 1,500 to 1,600 taels. Yuansheng Yong Yuanmao Yong Qianchang Xiang and others advanced first and then came out. Zhaofeng Chang Yifeng Yong Yuankangxiang Zhifeng Yong and others came out first and then advanced. The Dalian gang Wanxing advanced 778 in the morning market and came out 966, offsetting 238 taels. Shunli was the opposite. In the afternoon market, Wanxing advanced 686 and came out 336, offsetting 350 taels. Shunli advanced 385 and came out 231, offsetting 154 taels. Guangbang Hengxing advanced and came out a hundred taels or so in the morning market, and advanced about 300 taels in the afternoon market. There were a total of 16,219 taels of August chips.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate and Commodity Prices Rise Again, US Exchange Rate Alone Soars by 6875</h3>
<p>According to foreign telegrams yesterday, the London market's near-term and long-term rates both fell by 1.875, American silver rose by 0.25, British vs. US rose by 5.25 points, and US vs. British rose by 8.5 points. Forward silver prices fell by 5 hao to 1 li. Private telegrams fell slightly by 0.0625. When the exchange market opened, the British exchange rate was slightly tight at 0.0625, while the US exchange rate was strong at 3.125. The selling price for the near term was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 875 for the British exchange rate and 29.125 yuan for the US exchange rate. After the opening, the market gradually hardened (Zhengjin had picked up before the opening). HSBC Street revealed that the British discount was 1.25 and the American gain was 0.25. This was the loosest time. After that, it gradually became tighter again. The gold market covered short positions and rose. HSBC changed its quotation to a British discount of 0.25 and an American gain of 0.5 yuan. However, in addition to a slight tightening, the bank's selling appetite was only slightly suppressed. The market hardened immediately after opening in the afternoon. The bank was still blocking. Later, Meng sold a telegram saying that it had fallen by 4.415 anna. At this time, it was slightly even.

<h3>Silver Dollar Market Exceptionally Quiet</h3>
<p>丨丨Undoubtedly Affected by the Heat丨丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver dollar market was exceptionally quiet due to the intense summer heat, making most merchants reluctant to move around. The market rate for silver dollars was slightly better by one cent, calculated at six cents. However, the trading of drafts remained scarce. Morning transactions totaled just over 4.4 million, with new transactions at 600,000 to 700,000. Afternoon transactions were only over 200,000, and small association transactions were over 400,000.

The total value of banknotes in and out, including receipts and issues, was between 1.6 million and 1.7 million. Bank settlements of foreign merchant drafts were over 900,000 in silver and between 1.4 million and 1.5 million in foreign currency. Settlements for various goods, remittances, pledges, and miscellaneous items were less than 2 million in silver and between 2.4 million and 2.5 million in foreign currency.

<h3>Subsidiary Coinage Unchanged in Morning and Afternoon Markets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of subsidiary coinage in Jiangnan was minimal, with only 5,000 "jiao" transacted in the morning market. Therefore, the afternoon price remained unchanged, both morning and afternoon prices being 844 yuan. Although this was four yuan better than the previous afternoon, it was the same as the previous morning. The Guangdong subsidiary coinage market was also unusually calm, with both morning and afternoon prices at 772.5 yuan, slightly better by two cents than the previous day. Transactions totaled 70,000 "jiao" in the morning and 25,000 "jiao" in the afternoon. Copper coins remained at 316,500 "wen," with over 37,900 strings of "wen" transacted.</p>
<h3>New Currency Flowing in Steadily</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Central Mint began minting, a large number of new coins have entered the market daily. According to financial circles, the mint's casting of new coins has been very successful, producing 300,000 to 400,000 coins per day. Thus, the whole month could produce several million yuan, sufficient for market circulation. Therefore, there has been much use of new coins in the market recently, and purchases from other areas are also continuous.</p>
<h3>Securities Look Promising, Sentiment Gradually Converging</h3>
<h3>Government Bonds See Numerous New High Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market trended well again. The momentary setback had passed. Although large long positions still emerged, they ultimately could not meet the needs of various groups. Market sentiment remained strong without any slackening. Short sellers suffered repeated failures, deepening their caution. They hesitated to sell off easily, while those with goods held out for higher prices, and those without goods were even more hesitant. The market experienced a sense of shortage with only a slight increase in demand. As the day progressed, prices rose steadily. Except for demobilization bonds, the 1919 Customs bonds (both forward and near-term), and the 1996 bonds, various other bonds reached new high prices. The market's long positions did not retreat due to high prices, and there was still a trend to continue looking higher. However, as optimistic sentiment gradually converged, even individual investors favored long positions. If the environment does not change, it will likely remain stable. Originally, there was a plan to close the market in the afternoon, but it was temporarily postponed for a day or two due to other reasons. Currently, only three sessions are held each day, but trading is still quite active. The morning session opened with most bonds rebounding by two to six cents, except for consolidated salt bonds, which were relatively weak. The second session began at 2:30 PM, with prices continuing to rise by four to five cents. The closing session continued to rise, with another increase of three to four cents. The sixth consolidated bond was particularly strong, with the market consistently rebounding sharply, rising five to six cents to 1.2 to 1.3 cents, and the sixth consolidated bond rising by 1.5 cents. Trading was driven by the Northern faction. Although long positions in the No. 11 and No. 50 bonds emerged, they remained in short supply. However, as market prices rose higher, the level of risk also accumulated deeper. The total transaction volume was 11,853,000 yuan, including 3,000 yuan in spot transactions. Futures transactions were 3,565,000 for consolidated salt bonds, 1,600,000 for demobilization bonds, 1,400,000 for 1919 Customs bonds, and 1,790,000 for the 20-volume 20-Customs bonds, with the remainder ranging from tens of thousands to over one million. The patriotic bonds issued in 1922, totaling 20 million, have been traded in spot transactions in the market since yesterday, with a market price of 76 yuan. A discount table comparing market prices with the remaining face value is listed below for reference and warning:</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Fluctuates</h3>
<p>According to a report from Sin Fung &amp; Co., the New York stock market on Monday (the 10th) fluctuated. Commercial news favored long positions, but traders mostly stood aside, awaiting developments in the World Economic Conference and the outcome of the wheat processing tax levy. Bread company stocks rose to new highs due to bread price increases. Entertainment and brewing stocks were also strong. With no selling pressure, the market has the potential to rebound higher. The total daily trading volume was 4.84 million shares. U.S. cotton rose due to lack of rain in the west and exchange rate gains. The optimistic reduction report in the Saturday cotton field estimate was offset, but the actual reduction in bales remains questionable. Wheat advanced strongly due to poor spring wheat and lack of rain. The government report will be available today. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>
<p>| Closing Price | Compared to Previous Day |</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>| 30 Industrial Stocks | 104.08 | Down 1.07 |</p>
<p>| 20 Railroad Stocks | 54.73 | Down 0.94 |</p>
<p>| 20 Utility Stocks | 36.88 | Up 0.39 |</p>
<p>| 40 Bonds | 87.55 | Down 0.31 |</p>
<h3>Short Sellers Aggressively Covering, Yarn Prices Rise Firmly</h3>
<p>The yarn market suddenly rose, and the situation tightened. As U.S. cotton rose, short positions were covered, and the volume was quite large, further intensifying the upward trend. However, after falling for many days, this good news helped the rise become more pronounced. But actual demand has not yet been activated, so the market remains flat. If sales can improve, the market should have the potential to rise.</p>
<h3>Yarn Suddenly Improves by $1.89</h3>
<p>At the opening of the "Ren Biao" market, following the rise in foreign cotton, short sellers aggressively covered, causing a sharp upward trend. Prices for all months rose by $2.24, $2.45, $2.56. In the afternoon, upon hearing that spot yarn transactions were sluggish, prices for all months fell back by $0.67, $0.78, $0.89, to $1.40. The total volume of transactions for the day was 56,050 bales. Sales included 1,650 bales of "Ji Feng," 1,350 bales of "Ming De," 2,150 bales of "Rui Da," 1,150 bales of "Sen Kang," 3,750 bales of "Chang Feng," 1,450 bales of "Yong Chang," and 1,000 bales of "Shen Chang." Purchases included 5,400 bales of "Ren Feng," 5,750 bales of "Tong He," and 1,000 bales of "De Ji." Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>| "Ren Biao" Closing Price (Rise/Fall) Inventory | October 1953 | Up $1.90 | 73,030 | July 1870 | Up $0.11 | 31,800 | November 1962 | 18 | 54,500 |</p>

<p>Anqing: 20; Sichuan: 135; Counterparts: 240; Xiamen: 25</p>
<h3>New Activities in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The upward trend in the cotton market is still flat, but the sudden rise of U.S. cotton by 50 points has stirred up sentiment, and new players have become active. The market situation is firmer. However, old cotton prices are high, and buyers are lacking. The sales of spot cotton in the market are still sluggish, and the intentions of various factories are quite weak. It was heard in the afternoon that the gold market had fallen sharply, and the recent favorable weather conditions for new cotton growth were slightly softened.</p>
<h3>The Rally in Distant Month Cotton is Stronger</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Zheng Biao market, it rose following the rise in foreign prices. Buying interest was still strong. Cotton for all months rose by 2, 4, 5, 6 cents. In the afternoon, old cotton fell by 1.5 cents, while distant months rose by 0.5 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 92,300 "dan". Sales included 3,000 "dan" of "Yu Da", 2,600 "dan" of "Yi Chang", 4,400 "dan" of "Chang Feng", 2,300 "dan" of "Yong Chang", 2,400 "dan" of "Yuan Da", and 2,200 "dan" of "Chang He".

<h3>Factory Demand Almost Completely Stalled</h3>
<p>Demand for spot cotton has completely stalled. Factories show no intention of taking action.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton: 52.50; Public Grand Progress: 80 pieces; Sent to Factory</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Rebounds 50 Points</h3>
<p>丨Close at $0.011/Pound Above Opening丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton rose due to a lack of rain in drought-stricken areas and positive news from Liverpool. Mass purchases made the market lively and firm. As a result, spot prices rose by 50 points, and futures prices rose by 49 to 52 points. Liverpool spot prices fell by 14 points, and futures prices fell by 13.5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 12 points. The Bombay cotton market was initially firm due to short covering but later weakened due to profit-taking by long positions and sales by European exporters. As a result, Pingal rose by 1 rupee and 7.5 annas, Aumla rose by 7.5 annas, and Bai Luo Creek rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 10th):</p>
<p>| U.S. Cotton | Compared to Previous Day | Converted to National Currency | English Cotton | Compared to Previous Day | Converted to National Currency |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>

<h3>Coarse Rice Becomes Scarce, Prices Rebound by a Few Cents</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, there were over twenty arrivals. Business in the street shops was better. However, it was difficult to become vibrant immediately, and the sellers unanimously raised prices due to the limited arrivals. The situation tightened, and the market rebounded from weakness to freshness. Prices for coarse rice from Chang, Su, Tong, and South Harbor rose by a few cents. Only Du Yang tip rice remained flat due to the usual quality. As for customer purchases, only Tianjin customers bought 300-400 bags of loose and thin rice. Later, the Fuzhou group replenished over 100 bags. Other thin rice such as Qingjiao and Fengxi were all sold to local businesses. Therefore, the market had neither honor nor disgrace. The situation has become a stalemate between both sides. It is speculated that customers have some interest but will not make a move until prices are lowered. Sellers, on the other hand, believe that arrivals are limited and that customers will not easily sell off, resulting in a somewhat sturdy balance.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were thirteen or fourteen arrivals from various roads in Hexia. Sales of white rice in the market were slightly active, and the market was stable in the morning and tightened in the afternoon. Early thin rice arrivals were limited and sales were slow, with prices increasing slightly. Yang Du tip rice experienced neither honor nor disgrace. White Yuan was flat.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Near Months Fall, Distant Months Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the prices of each month generally showed a pattern of near months falling and distant months remaining stable. As quotations for foreign wheat rose by about 4-5 cents, people’s sentiment after the opening appeared to be quite stable. However, although the prices of agricultural products abroad are now internationalized and are gradually rising, domestic sales have been greatly affected because transportation to the Northeast is restricted by tariffs and cannot run smoothly. Therefore, in fact, the disposal of flour is inevitably greatly affected, so although the atmosphere is good, the sentiment cannot become firm. In the morning and afternoon sessions, small factories slightly reduced inventory, and the Northern customers were also selling back, causing the market to be flat. As a result, this month fell 2.5%, August improved 2.5%, September-October fell slightly 2.5%, November fell slightly 5%, and December was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Distant-Month Wheat Slightly Better in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market in wheat futures generally showed a flat market trend after the opening in the morning. Although the quoted price for foreign imports rose by 4-5 cents, the arrivals of new goods were booming and the stocks were abundant. Therefore, the factories only did small deals and had no bulk appetite. As a result, people’s sentiment was weak, falling about 2-3 cents. By the opening of the afternoon session, the near months were still flat, and the distant months showed a slight upward trend as outside investors slightly replenished, but trading was not very smooth. As a result, this month fell slightly 3 cents, August fell slightly 1 cent, September improved 3 cents, October improved 1 cent, November-December was unchanged. The market for spot wheat remained flat, but ready-to-ship goods were available for sampling at affordable prices, while medium-quality goods remained unchanged. Opening prices were 3.65 yuan per "dan" for Taiping Bridge wheat, and medium-quality wheat was 3.55 yuan. Yangzhou wheat was 3.55 yuan, medium-quality 3.52 yuan. Hushu wheat was 3.47 yuan, Kunshan wheat was 3.55 yuan, medium-quality 3.42 yuan. Gaoyou wheat was 3.65 yuan, Danyang wheat was 3.55 yuan, Zhenjiang wheat was 3.52 yuan, medium-quality 3.47 yuan. Liuhe wheat was 3.52 yuan, medium-quality 3.50 yuan, Suqian high wheat was 3.75 yuan, Fuxin sold 5,000 bags, Xinda sold 2,000 bags, Shenda sold 1,000 bags, and Fufeng chartered 2,500 bags of wheat.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Peanut Oil is Scarce and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Peanut oil sales have been quite strong recently, mainly because the vegetable seed oil market is tight. Peanut oil's inland sales have been strong, and yesterday's market saw about 1,300-1,400 transactions, with prices up 2 cents from the previous day. Current inventories in this city are depleted, and it is feared that a surge in arrivals will not be easily seen in the short term, indicating a continued upward trend.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Summer Dried Cocoons from Zhejiang Increase in Shanghai</h3>
<h3>Shaoxing Summer Cocoon Market Suspends Weighing</h3>
<p>The production volume of summer cocoons in Shaoxing's various cities and villages is not weak. Five or six cocoon shops are weighing and collecting summer cocoons, with each shop collecting about 600-700 "dan." The average cocoon price is around 35-36 yuan. Currently, they are all dried and shipped out by water and land.</p>
<h3>Changan Cocoon Bales Actively Shipped</h3>
<p>The Changan Station has been busy shipping out summer dried cocoons recently. The volume of cocoons shipped out in the past half month has reached 2,000 bales, and there are still 600-700 bales waiting to be transported. The Railway Bureau is currently adding cars to actively ship them out in preparation for the end of the season.</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Shandong Silk Waste is Shipped to England</h3>
<p>Since new sales channels were discovered in England for Shandong "Da Er Wan Shou" (i.e., silk waste), 500-600 "dan" are shipped out every month. Yesterday, the British mail ship "Ravabin Ti" exported 320 pieces of Shandong silk waste from Xiang Mao and other companies to England.</p>
<h3>New White Filature Thrown Open</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign exchange was weak, and overseas silk prices remained difficult to stabilize. Although the Shanghai European firms all received overseas accounts, the spread price was still small. Chinese silk merchants feared another decline, and the selling of term silk was not weak. Bai Filature had 120 bales traded by American firms, and Ji Li New Dry Filature was also thrown open. Qianli entered the market with 250 bales of recent-term futures, but prices were still not high. The opening prices of this year's new local silk are relatively high, making it difficult for white silk merchants to profit.</p>
<h3>LUZHUANG "Zhen Mei" Tea Transactions are Booming</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at LUZHUANG, the British firms Jinlong, Yihui, Xiehe, and Tianyu showed strong interest in "Zhen Mei" green tea. Items such as "Zhen Mei Needle" and "Xiu Mei" are also selling actively. The total transaction volume of green tea from various sources in the city reached more than 3,970 boxes. Prices for high-quality "Zhen Mei Needle" and "Zhen Mei" goods continued to rise by 2-3 yuan, and the market was very firm. It is found that the amount of green tea imported by various foreign firms is double the number at the same time last year, and foreign demand has not slackened. However, most of the summer tea from various tea-producing areas in Anhui and Zhejiang was not harvested, resulting in reduced production. According to general merchants, the green tea market is expected to continue to rise.</p>

<h3>Bachelor Club</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>According to a London dispatch in a certain newspaper yesterday, more than a hundred young people in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England, have formed a bachelor club. Members must have a solitary personality and adhere to a set of rules. Recently, a rival group has emerged, organized by romantic women in the city, dedicated to seducing members of the club. In addition, some women have distributed opposing leaflets, criticizing the club.</p>
<p>The dispatch contains the above information. I do not know the motive for the club's organization, but based on my personal speculation, there are only two meanings: (1) England! Not only England, the economic downturn, the increase in the number of unemployed, individual lives are easier to solve, (2) because in recent years women are extravagant and lustful, dissolute and unruly, men's supply has increased suffering, and moral aspects are even more unreliable. I think the motive for organizing the club is nothing more than that.</p>
<p>If my observation is correct, the reasons for women's opposition are not difficult to imagine. The reasons are (1) if men cut off economic subsidies, then women cannot indulge and squander to their heart's content, and be immoderate in their desires, (2) romantic women originally regard men as playthings, if men advocate bachelorhood, do not let them play, then romantic women must feel lonely and bored, unable to practice their romantic life. I think the significance of wanting to destroy the club is probably just that.</p>
<p>Chinese people's common saying is that women are men's playthings. In fact, this statement is originally incorrect. Mencius said, "Eating and sex are nature." This nature should originally cover both men and women. Originally, men have sex, don't women have sex? If we talk about playthings, men regard women as playthings, women regard men as playthings, playing to and fro is originally not a problem, but the previous system was wider in restricting men and stricter in restricting women, so women's sex was not allowed to fly and be unruly, acting arbitrarily, so women's sex was not easy to see, and only men's sex was seen. Now it's reversed. Isn't women's sex nakedly expressed? How to perform, I don't have to say, just look, you don't have to go to the ballroom or the new theater to see, just go to the street to see.</p>
<p>However, at present, the men in our country have not organized a bachelor club, because the occupational problems and economic problems in our country, although they have reached the end of the road, the extended family system has not been completely broken, and several senior predecessors still regard the marriage of children as the only duty of parents, so all burdens are borne by the parents, doing the work of cattle and horses very authentically. And what about the young people? They have neither felt the pain of the family nor been burdened by women, so they are still desperately pursuing and talking about love. I think the period of awakening will eventually arrive not far away.</p>

<p>A servant suddenly rises, what can you bear? A great dream sinking deep, the battle raining hard, where to find coolness in the dusty world? A defeat in western Guangdong, he flees to Annam.</p>
<p>There are problems in the Northwest Military Region, and the commander is stationed in the marsh of Yishui. Washing away the heat in Tangshan, a peerless beauty holds hands with him.</p>
<p>Without the north wind map in the luggage, ashamed of following the heat in the capital, choose a lotus-covered place to cool off at will, outside Houhu, Lake Mochou.</p>
<p>Green trees surround the cottage, cicadas chirp disorderly, another day of sultry heat in Jinling, sweat rain washes away the remaining coolness of the whole body, there are hot springs up and down South Tang.</p>
<h3>Four Times</h3>
<p>1.  A girl is not very emotional when she is small.</p>
<p>2.  A girl is the happiest in her youth.</p>
<p>3.  A girl in middle age is a pair of corpses.</p>
<p>4.  Old age is not pleasant.</p>
<h3>Nothing is Too Strange</h3>
<p>— Ben</p>
<p>Shanghai is so big that nothing is too strange. Because nothing is too strange, Shanghai has become bigger and bigger. This is the malformation of the present society and the inevitable tendency of the deformed city.</p>
<p>The newspaper reported the day before yesterday that Chief Detective Lu Dagong of the Chinese police suddenly had a well-dressed young man follow him to a dark place while on duty at the garden last night. He produced a card with the name Dai Yunfang. Lu asked what he was doing. He replied</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>that he was a former actress in the Xian Shi Amusement Park, but due to the difficulty of life, he had become a male prostitute. When asked how much he charged per night, he replied eight yuan, and invited Lu to his home. Lu immediately arrested him.</p>
<p>This is truly a great wonder of the world. Compared to the spectacle of human-dog copulation performed at a certain large hotel last year, it is comparable and is also a page in the glorious history of Shanghai's civilization.</p>
<p>Humans are "survival-seeking" animals. Since society is like this, if they have nothing to do and nothing to eat, making it impossible for them to "survive" in a normal way, they can only take the distorted wrong path. Therefore, thieves, bandits, kidnappers, prostitutes, and other characters appear in society, and they are increasing day by day. In this way, Dai Yunfang's flow as a male prostitute has an unavoidable social hardship. Life persecutes him so, how sad and how serious the problem is.</p>
<p>Secondly, we should talk about the evils of deformed big cities. Vanity and the maze of pleasure cover someone's heart. The harsh environment leads you to the wrong path anytime, anywhere. The lights, the wine, the meat, and the desire flow. How many can resist his temptation? The rich and powerful are感于"生"的平庸,更醉心于新奇的剌激,因此嗎啡紅丸鴉片神女等等乃遂昌盛,男妓不能謂非是富于新剌激的一種玩意兒,所以戴雲芳便出而幹這一套,若果臉袋縹緻,行使得法,未始不可奇貨高售,贏得生活舒舒服服.</p>
<p>However, according to Dai Yunfang's confession, he is already employed in the Xianshi Amusement Park and should be able to maintain a minimum standard of living. Unlike the poor who have nowhere to turn, he is willing to stoop to this level, and is truly a most unproductive person. It is both pitiful and hateful.</p>
<p>In short, this phenomenon is not accidental, and it is not surprising. It is the morbid prelude to the current society, and the inevitable undertaking in the deformed city. If there is no way out for the entire society, such events, in Shanghai, will not only not disappear, but will increase day by day, and will spread throughout the country.</p>
<h3>Sketches of School Life</h3>
<p>— Lin Ru</p>
<p>It was a deep autumn evening.</p>
<p>"I am originally..."</p>
<p>"Sister, I love you..."</p>
<p>"Eh ah..."</p>
<p>"Oh good form"</p>
<p>Various different tones emanated from the dormitory, illuminated by electric lights as bright as day.</p>
<p>"Why is the 'flower monk' dormitory so noisy tonight?"</p>
<p>Q, who was stubborn and therefore called a 'virtuous woman,' hearing such unsettling sounds, although unwilling to understand, finally asked with impatience.</p>
<p>"They are holding an emergency meeting!" Y, who loves to meddle in other people's affairs and is best at finding out about others, would certainly not be an exception today, so he volunteered to answer. In fact, Q was not asking him.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Q directly admitted she was asking.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow they will compete in football with the county high school. Did you know? They are discussing battle strategies. I just saw through their door that the 'flower monk' was still giving SP a 'tsk'! 'Golden Gourd' ran away in a huff because he couldn't get a good position. I'm afraid the match might not happen tomorrow. I heard that when Xu Lazi (the physical education director and disciplinarian) came to call the roll, the 'flower monk' was flirting with him and was caught. Because he had also discovered the 'flower monk's' secret, he only showed a knowing smile and didn't say anything official. Y, because you are a 'virtuous woman,' there are even funnier things that I can't tell you directly!" Y said with a knowing look.</p>
<p>"Filthy rat! You are bad! You are selling suspense!"</p>
<p>Y was weighing the pros and cons of what to say when a group of friends who loved to hear news gathered here from as far as thirteen dormitories away. They waited for a long time without hearing anything substantial and became anxiously impatient.</p>
<p>Y wanted to sell another suspense, but was scared by a huge palm striking down!</p>
<p>"After dinner, I passed by the bathroom and heard people talking and laughing inside. I thought what. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be the 'flower monk' making a request to SP! Saying, 'You used to say it was too hot and wouldn't agree, but now there's no excuse!' SP shyly replied, 'Let's see how the match goes tomorrow.' Land God, you think! How desperately will the 'flower monk' fight tomorrow to win the 'pink' night! Tang Monk! Are you listening too? Turn around and look at the virtuous woman's face!"</p>
<p>A nameless, mysterious feeling arose in the minds of each listener.</p>

<p>Ms. Shen Xiuhua's Painting (Brief Biography)</p>
<p>Shen Qiwen, courtesy name Xiuhua, is a native of Shanghai and the daughter of Mr. Shen Boqin. Her nature is gentle and refined, and she excels at painting, copying ancient works with divine understanding. She is an indoor disciple of Songshan Thatched Cottage. Her father, Mr. Boqin, has always been enthusiastic about local public welfare, contributing greatly to the establishment of the Nanshi Fire Department, and is especially fond of his daughter. He often took her to famous mountains and scenic spots, traveling far without hesitation. Last year, he took his daughter to Mount Tai to see the waterfall at Black Dragon Pool, where he accidentally fell into the water and died. This is also a tragic scene in Ms. Shen's painting history.</p>
<h3>A Corner of the City</h3>
<p>— Er Chu</p>
<p>The bustling city is full of lurking, frightening things; this exhibition of the true state of the inner workings fully demonstrates the city's recession!</p>
<p>In a certain corner of the city, there lies the "nest." To the average person who is used to it, "nest life" seems to stand on the same level as "home," and there is nothing rare about it. But on the other hand, observation, it is inevitable to bring some mysterious color. In short, the "nest" is an irregular organization. The impression "nest life" gives us is: astonishment!</p>
<p>"Going to the nest requires climbing high." This is almost a theorem. Moreover, the path to the nest must be unusually tortuous. For example: A nest in an alley, of course, is entered and exited from the back door. That ladder, about a foot wide, is really tiring, and it is also winding and tortuous, with the style of walking the Nine-Bend Bridge of the City God Temple. In addition, it is dark and without light, even in the daytime, it will make you unable to find your way.</p>
<p>The first step, walking into the nest, the first thing you feel is a burst of inexplicable stench. (Perhaps the nest dwellers think it is fragrant.) Then there is a cloud of smoke lingering and covering the entire nest, as if a smoke bomb has been set off. In this haze, there are many "nest dwellers" lying like hunters, each focusing on the lamp head.</p>
<p>Lying on a couch, all worries disappear, burning away all the troubles of the world on this lamp the size of a yellow bean, clean and neat. The pitiful result: emaciated appearance, haggard complexion, waxy face, paper-like lips, truly astonishing.</p>
<p>In this "immortal nest," occasionally there are "immortal women" descending, mediating many incense relationships. They lie on the couch, stretching their arms lightly, and dropping pearls easily, isn't it wonderful! The troublesome thing is that afterwards, it is necessary to repeat the powdering once again.</p>
<p>Alas! Mysterious! Nest life!</p>

<h3>Fifteen-Year-Old Vendor</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a student who dropped out of fifth grade and also an orphan. My father was tragically bombed to death in the January 28th Shanghai Incident. My mother and five-year-old younger brother escaped the war zone, but we had to beg from the masses during the day and sleep in the wind at night. This inhuman life was difficult to sustain for long. Later, I became a vendor and sold evening newspapers to earn a small profit to make a living. However, business has been slow recently, and what I earn all day is only enough to support myself. My mother is often hungry. Recalling her past life, she is filled with grief and resentment and has repeatedly wanted to commit suicide. My family was originally able to support itself, but it was tragically affected by the national disaster and suddenly became impoverished. If my mother commits suicide, my younger brother will be displaced or abducted by bandits. Every time I think of this, I can't help but cry. Now, in order to dispel my mother's thoughts of despair and to find a place for my younger brother to be raised, I specifically implore the editor and your colleagues for guidance. I hope you can introduce a charitable organization (such as the China Child Welfare Association, the Songhu Memorial Guangci Hospital, the China Women and Children Relief Association, or other church groups, etc.) to take in and raise him. My mother (currently thirty-five years old) requests to be in the same place, working as a maid, with wages not counted, only seeking food and lodging, so that mother and son can depend on each other and get through the difficult times. Once I am a little older (I am now fifteen years old) and my ability to make a living increases, I will naturally assume full responsibility for supporting them. I have always admired your concern for social suffering, especially the cries of those in the slums, and you have always responded. Now, my family's situation is one of those who have no way to cry out in the slums. I implore you to give us relief. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Respectfully, Wang Changlu</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Wang is only fifteen years old this year. Don't say if he was born into a wealthy family, even in a family that can barely make ends meet, wouldn't he still be in the "golden age of not knowing the immensity of heaven and earth"? Now, because he was born into a poor family, he is self-reliant. This is not enough. He also has to be sad for his mother and younger brother. We often hear people say, "People should be born equal." In this situation, how can we explain it? Mr. Wang's current plight is absolutely not of his own making; or he has already worked harder than any other person of the same age! If human compassion still exists in this world, people like Mr. Wang should be the first to receive help. What he hopes for now is to sell his mother's labor, and he doesn't want to freeload on others. His thinking is even more admirable. Are there people in the world who want to buy this kind of labor? Why hasn't anyone noticed him? He also hopes that charitable organizations will rescue his younger brother. If those who run charitable causes don't save this kind of person, I really don't know what kind of people they are saving? Therefore, we specifically publish Mr. Wang's letter here; hoping that those who originally wanted to buy labor, and those who were originally running charitable causes, can know that there is such a family of several people in this world, waiting to be bathed in your deep kindness. If there are any letters, this column is very willing to forward them. However, Mr. Wang also hopes that his mother can be with his younger brother. Of course, we can't say that he doesn't have this hope, but if it can't be done, he has to give up. You must know that a person who asks for help, of course, should not attach conditions unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Fiction</p>
<h3>Under the Traffic Lights (24)</h3>
<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>"Is he home? Can you ask him to come and sit for a while!" He said, pretending not to care.</p>
<p>"He's busy, I don't know!" The third concubine simply regarded Li Shiqiao as a rare commodity.</p>
<p>"He just came back, I'll go ask him!" Ah Zhen rushed to call Shiqiao, not only wanting to please Yu Jiefu, she couldn't wait for an answer and went by herself.</p>
<p>Here, Jiefu was calculating what to say without losing his status.</p>
<p>After a while, two people knocked on the door and came in. Following behind was the dwarf Wang Hua. Yang Jiefu was preparing a welcoming expression, looking at the dwarf Wang Hua - an unfamiliar intruder, he felt very uncomfortable in his heart. Even worse, this dwarf actually smiled and extended his hand to him, saying:</p>
<p>"Ah, Mr. Yang, Mr. Yang, long time no see! How have you been?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Yang" had to put on half a smile, the other half of his face filled with hesitation. He reluctantly let the dwarf shake his hand a few times. Wang Hua didn't feel bored because of this, and continued enthusiastically:</p>
<p>"Mr. Yang, we haven't seen each other for almost half a year! That was after the September 18th Incident last year, right? I remember Mr. Yang's speech at the National Goods Exhibition was so poignant, advocating national goods is the fundamental way to save the country!"</p>
<p>This reminded Jiefu. He had exchanged business cards once at the National Goods Exhibition, but he had forgotten his name, only remembering that this dwarf seemed to be a representative of the Seventh Party Department. Yang Jiefu, who was used to social situations, didn't know the dwarf's name, but it was inconvenient to ask "May I ask your name?" So he had to,</p>
<p>"There, there!" apologized a few times. Li Shiqiao also saw that the situation was not right and quickly introduced them cleverly:</p>
<p>"This Mr. Wang Hua is an old classmate of mine. He recently launched the XXXX Group Federation. Mr. Wang is also a key member! He came to visit Mr. Yang specially!"</p>
<p>"Ah! So that's how it is, Mr. Wang is rare!" Yang Jiefu's alertness was of course no less than Wang Hua's. He said: "What a coincidence, what a coincidence, I just saw your association's telegram, contacting so many groups is really not easy! At this time, relying on everyone to shout together can defeat the Japanese, so... your association's plan must be very good!"</p>
<p>"There, there, this depends on Mr. Yang's support!" Wang Hua turned his head to look at the third concubine, wanting to speak, but only smiled and nodded, because he didn't have time to analyze whether to call her Miss Li or Mrs. Yang.</p>
<p>So, everyone sat down according to their status. They couldn't help but exchange a few words about the weather. Yang Jiefu gradually dragged the topic to where he wanted to go.</p>
<p>"...Mr. Wang is right! Shanghai is too complicated. The organization of national salvation groups must be the responsibility of upright people. I see a lot of people often extorting merchants under the guise of inspecting Japanese goods. Where does that make sense? For example..."</p>
<p>"There are really too many traitors!" The hot-blooded Li Shiqiao never let go of these topics lightly. He seriously continued: "In my opinion, I'm not afraid of them extorting merchants, I'm only afraid that these kinds of people are easily bribed by traitors. Therefore, the most important thing for us is to eliminate these fake patriotic traitors!"</p>
