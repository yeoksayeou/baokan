<h3>時評</h3>
<p>如何救亡　哲</p>
<p>熱河之失。據一般人之判斷。爲因固多。但其最要者。則爲湯玉麟平時横徵暴歛。政治貪腐敗。久使熱民疾首痛心。願與偕亡。故日寇之來。莫肯抗禦。且以去湯爲快。夫然後日寇及得以長驅直入。天險地。不旬日而全部淪亡。此種判斷無論何人。不能加以否認。然而此種現象。又豈僅熱河失守一事而已哉。即前歲九一八之變。東北三省人民。徒宛轉爼上。待人宰割。而有侮莫禦。有土莫守亦何莫非近數十年來腐敗政治累積之惡果。語有云。（物必先腐而後蟲生之。）傳亦有曰。（國必自伐而後人伐之。）故在今日情勢之下。外寇固急。内政亦急。政府如無改革内政之决心。則亦必無抗禦外寇力量。此無他。民心旣已不屬。。力量自由集中。故外寇亦遂無由抗禦耳。</p>
<p>雖然。吾人之所謂改革内政。非欲偏重於以武力戡定動亂。冀以恢復國家與社會之秩序。蓋内之所以不安。即由於政治之腐化。故安内之道。。實即在於予腐化之政治以根本之改革。非强力壓迫所能成功也</p>
<p>我國近二十年來之政治。一言以蔽之。即爲軍閥政治與官僚政治之延續軍人之分疆割據猶昔也。官吏之貪污奔競猶昔也。政客之煽惑播亞猶昔也。而營營逐逐。惟位是競。惟利是爭。罔恤國脈民命。亦無一不如曩昔也。政治之措施。大都與人民之利益相背馳。官日以肥。民日以瘠。老弱輾轉。少壯流離。總之民國以來。災禍相乘。動亂相繼。腐敗之政治與分崩離析之局面。旣已深種外侮之禍根。一旦有事。欲使此日處於水深火熱中寃苦莫訴之人民。爲國效命。爲民族效死。以抗禦强寇。自爲事實上所難能。矧在民窮財盡救死不暇之際。根本上尤無抗禦强暴之實力乎。吾人言此。初非歸咎於某一方面某一集團也。國勢至此。何能專作消極之怨尤。抑且此二十年來黑暗政治之所以能得繼續延長。與其徒歸過於主持政治之少數人。母寗謂我全國人民都應負此責任。今日之國勢。已臻於萬分險惡之地步。亦已臻於山窮水盡之絕境。吾人而欲打破國難。突出重圍。則非改革政治與民更始。俾民心得所依附民力得以集中不爲功。斯爲當前最急要之問題。亦即當前最迫切之工作。望我舉國上下。三思毋忽。</p>

<h3>英技師被捕事件</h3>
<p>英俄邦交緊張李維諾夫堅持外僑須受蘇俄法律拘束英大使提出抗議謂英俄邦交破裂堪慮</p>
<p>路透十七日莫斯科電蘇俄外長李維諾夫今日通告駐莫斯科英大使稱、被捕之維加電氣公司雇員、將以反革命罪在最高法庭審訊、此罪之處罰爲死刑、李維諾夫對於在蘇俄僑居之英人、不受蘇俄法律拘束一層加以駁斥、李氏表示希望此案不致影響英俄邦交、因邦交較諸任何商店或個人均爲重要也云云、駐俄英大使已提出抗議、謂怠工之罪、實不足信、並要求將此案撤消否則勢將影響四月十七日期滿之英俄商業協定、而英俄邦交亦將有破裂之可能云、</p>
<p>塔社十七日莫斯科電蘇聨政府對於拘捕維克公司六英雇員事、已拒絕英政府之干涉、其交涉之經過如下、三月十五日包爾溫於英國會下院報告、謂英政府已訓令英國駐英斯科大使奥維、向蘇聨政府提出（嚴厲之質問）、并聲明此種拘捕案、將（引起英蘇關係之不幸結果、）據此間今日消息、奥維已向李維諾夫提出英政府之質問、同時李氏已加以答復、李氏之答復云、英大使關於此案之要求、實際即主張所有英僑應不受蘇聨法律之管理、使彼得犯罪而能免裁判、在此種情形下、一英人於犯案被控時、雖已得有證據或其確認之口供、仍可因其政府之一語無罪而中止裁判、此種提議、顯然爲任何獨立國家之政府所不能接受、蓋如有犯罪而有證據存在者、則其負責之當局必須依據法律及國家安全之原則、考察其證據、確定其實際之有罪或無罪、或明　其犯罪之動機、設法加以制止、此乃各國所有必然之程序、非僅蘇聨爲然也、例如最近國外即曾發生拘捕及裁判居於重要固定載務之外人及控訴外國大銀行代表之事件、惟此　情形旣屬無可避免、亦不能影響於較個人及公司之利益更有重大意義之國際關係、在蘇聨有千百德國美國及其他國之僑民、彼等未嘗被拘控、自英蘇成立邦交以來、英人來蘇聨者亦達數百、彼等自由往來未有被拘之事、即維克公司之代表在蘇聨已近十年、亦未有何事發生、故最近之拘捕案、實因其犯罪之重要、爲保障國家及固有財產之安全不得不然者、如此種偶然之事足以影響對蘇聨及英國相互有利之政治及商務關係、則大謬誤矣、故蘇聨政府對於該英雇員書之法律裁判、當不能以任何壓迫及威脅而寛懈、英政府及其使署如確知此案犯者之無罪、亦可不用驚惶也云、固英大使之請求、李維諾夫已告以該六英雇員係犯蘇聨刑法第五十八條、現國家政治局之審察已將完事、該案不久可移交最高法庭審判云、</p>

<h3>天津情勢嚴重</h3>
<p>蔣北上後頽風已振　　冀省主席赴保請示</p>
<p>天津通訊、熱河失陷、華北爲之震驚、敵人勢力、將迫近平津、惟連日連日嘉峰口之激戰、我宋哲元部奮勇抵抗敵以傷亡過多似擬撤至相當地點以待援軍、再取攻勢、古北口方面、我□□□部、前日另築凘析陣地後現又開到大部生力軍接防、故士氣甚盛、熱北方面、孫殿部前因在赤峰被敵包圍、前後失援現亦退至相當地點、再圖聨絡應戰、查此次熱戰、如非張學良於事前漫無組織配置、及統帥張作相之趦趄不前、曁入熱各師、毫無統系、决無喪地如是之速、觀宋部在喜峰口抗戰、足爲證也、</p>
<p>蔣委員長北上後、黨軍政各方面、其精神已不若從前之散漫、蓋張學良時代、故都空氣、已造成一種奢靡閒逸之風、雖對外情勢、極形嚴重、仍然未變、近則已有革新整頓之象矣、</p>
<p>天津爲軍事後方重鎭、在上月熱戰方起、駐津日軍　有擾亂計劃、意圖截斷我後方接濟、嗣因牽制國際問題太多、祇得待機而發、不料戰數日而下承德、一時情形趨緩、現暈因我軍積極向長城一帶增援、日軍爲擾亂平津計、行動又趨積極津日界與華界接壤之處均築有鐵栅或磚墻、以資防禦、夜間在界内放出哨兵、注意行人、並嚴加搜索、以是日界商務日形冷淡、駐津日總領事桑島主計、上月杪曾向冀省府提出抗議、藉口辛丑條約、於離津二十華里内不准駐兵、請撤退津郊穆莊子我國軍隊、業由省府據理函復最近日領又向省府提出第二次抗議措詞强硬、略謂中國方面、如不撤退津郊駐軍、萬一發生事件、應由中國方面負責其一種挑釁嫁禍之意、顯然暴露、故近日情形、又由和緩趨於緊張、省主席于學忠、因軍事外交問題、關係重要、除隨時向蔣委員長何部長羅部長報告情形外、特於前日偕同蔣委員長代表何競武由津赴北平保定、謁晤蔣何羅諸當局、請示一切、今日于氏業已返津、力持鎭靜態度並明令各警憲、注意地方治安、妥愼防範、故謡言雖盛、而市上序、尙平靜如故、（三月十六日）</p>

<h3>番放全國政治犯</h3>
<h3>何香凝發表具體意見</h3>
<p>釋放後卽派赴前方工作　　總理對陳烱明尙予自新　　革命爲人道應繼續遺志</p>
<p>中央委員何香凝女士、日前致書中央各委員、建議大赦全國政治犯、交彼率領北上、從事抗日軍之救護工作、日日社記者昨走訪何氏於其寓所啊詢具體意見、承談甚詳、茲誌於下、</p>
<h3>給予自新之路</h3>
<p>何氏首謂、書已發出多日、但至今尙無聲息、無權力者之建議、照例是不置議或擱起的、我的建議、在情在理是没有什麽不對、不過希望如何、是很難說的、我想不過等於買香檳票罷了、有人以爲大赦政治犯、是太平時候的事、但我所謂大赦、是要給有改造社會愛護國家思想的政治犯、一個自新的求仁的機會、况且我建議書中說過、政府不放心、或者以我能力不夠的話、不妨派員監視、在外侮憑凌之今日、不予以報國的機會、而將其生命銷磨於牢獄之中、是說不過去的、社會之亂、實由於怨毒所積、此怨毒不求所以消除之方、且從而增長之則政治犯永無釋放之日、而國家必永没有太平之時了、精誠團結、共赴國難、中央諸君年來高唱入雲、則此輩政治犯、多有當年的革命友軍及同志者、除了没有自由及權位而外、與中央諸君没有什麽不同的、何以有精誠而不得團結、有國難而不許共赴呢、試問中央諸君、有幾位不是當年的政治犯、稍有推已及人的心、當然要接受我的建議的、許多青年政治犯、當年惟恐其不起者、今日惟恐其不死以革命自命的人們、回首當年、眞不知作何感想、</p>
<h3>援陳烱明故事</h3>
<p>何氏繼謂陳烱明背叛總理、爲法律與道德所不容、然總理當年尙准其自新、其部下現在也在政府任職者、至北洋軍閥之反對革命、現在且可爲忠寳同志、則此輩政治犯、實没有什麽不可赦的理由、政治犯的行爲、固然有許多錯誤、但黨政府的措施、也應該加以反省的、若純就革命立塲來判斷、則誰爲罪犯、是很有問題的了、</p>
<h3>革命是爲人道</h3>
<p>何氏又謂、有人評我此舉、是人道主義的發揮、我很不明白、幾年來自命革命的人們、都異口同聲的非難人道主義、但革命的最終目的、并不與人道主義衝突的、革命不爲人道、難道是爲獸道嗎、我的建議如是、爲人道主義的話、則不過是總理革命是愛人的人道主義、是仲愷先生　護革命青年的人道主義、絕不是欺僞膚淺的人道主義、</p>
<h3>繼續仲愷遺志</h3>
<p>何氏末謂、我的建議、是公道的、超於黨派的革命立塲絕無絲毫的政治作用、我始終維護總理民十三的改組精神、保存總理臨終遺囑時給我的印象、我始終要繼續仲愷先生的遺志、要打倒帝國主義、解救中國而至世界人們的痛苦、實現三民主義的民生主義的社會、在革命失敗而後、絕不參加任何黨派、年來有許多青年、來要求我組黨組派、但我不敢欺騙人、人也不能傀儡我、所以通通加以謝絕、我從來是没有野心的、對公博說過、希望大家不要製造孤兒寡婦、因爲與我同病而比我慘痛可憐的人、是更多着呢、假若眞能貫澈總理的國民革命的主旨、未嘗不可以省了許多孤兒寡婦的眼淚、但現在則又如何呢、我不是製造政治犯的人、也請釋放政治犯、則製造政治犯的人、也應該問問良心、要贊成我的建議了、說至此、何氏患病未愈、表示疲倦、記者乃興辭而出、</p>

<h3>閩江疏通後</h3>
<h3>滬閩班輪直放南台</h3>
<p>發達運輸先聲</p>
<p>福建閩江、因吃水甚淺、而暗礁又多、故敵輪之赴閩者僅到馬尾爲止、客貨運往福州、在在需要駁船接載、足使市面、不能盡量發達、自閩省政府改組後、首先辦理開浚閩江、接通航輪、使上海之福州船、均能直達南台、第一步工事已告成功、今閩省府已電滬上各輪公司、請開放南台直航輪、從此福州航運、不特可直達内江、而可利便福州旅行、此事關係交通至鉅、本報記者、特赴各方面調查、用將狀况分記如下、</p>
<h3>疏濬閩江</h3>
<p>福建閩江、向來水尺甚淺、舉凡到福州旅客貨物、統在馬尾用駁船轉運、需費旣多而又周折、閩省府爲發達福州市商業起見、特公决首從開濬閩江、實現通航爲第一步、乃由府成立閩江開濬工程局、以林知淵司其事、業經積極動工、先將阻礙航路處挖通、</p>
<h3>避開暗礁</h3>
<p>閩江内自馬尾至南台、有三四十哩江道、平日最深之處、不過十二三英尺、而中間自魁岐到壁頭一段、暗礁叢立、爲航行最危險之地、常有商船在該段失事、此次濬江工程局、以閩江通輪、必先去此魁歧礁石、而又不易轟炸、經與閩省府議决、在魁岐壁頭一段、另闢新江水道、繞去暗礁之處、而將航路開直、施工以來、迄已告成</p>
<h3>試航成功</h3>
<p>在民十八時、滬上寗紹公司甬興輪、以吃水淺而噸位小、曾經减裝儎脚、試行福州内港直達南台、當時各界稱便、尤爲旅客與貨主所歡迎、嗣後因江水深淺不一、常有阻礙、無法續行、此次經開濬之後、已將全江水道挖深、在小潮汛時、經測騐之下、有十三英尺五寸、大潮時亦可漲到十六尺上月閩當局用海輪試航、結果凡三千噸商輪之行駛閩江、可以兩次開輕儎、一次載重儎、蓋上海福州班輪、最大者吃水爲十五英尺也、</p>
<h3>困難解决</h3>
<p>當初甬興行駛南台時、馬尾碼頭工駁船帮等各工人、以生活關係、曾發生重大糾紛、致各輪局多所顧慮、未敢改駛閩江、又因閩江内木排竹筏、時常充塞江面、航行困難、今工潮已由省府出爲調解、此復行輪可無糾紛、至於江面之竹筏木排、更令閩海關派定管理專員、不使再礙航道、各項困難之點、悉皆解决、</p>
<h3>滬輪通訊</h3>

<h3>讀者顧問</h3>
<h3>（中國的病在那裏）的問題</h3>
<p>江陰濮秉鈞南京柏超兩君來訊</p>
<p>申報闢了讀者顧問欄後，我是常留心看的，常看見先生和許多讀者的宏論，對各種問題予以詳盡的討論和眞確的解答，欽佩之至。不過最近先生兩次答復沈祖光君的問題（中國的病在那裏，）我不能認爲滿意，我覺得先生並没有站在顧問的立場上予沈君以誠懇的解答，沈君對於現代政治學說，雖然缺不不研究，討論的文字有矛盾的地方，而沈君所提出的問題（中國的病在那裏？）是值得討論的，沈君的態度是誠有懇的，（國家的定義是什麽？政府的定義是什麽？）先生在指出沈君的錯誤後應該接着告訴他什麽才是眞確的定義。先生旣然有（中國？的病的那裏？）的根本見解，應該予沈君以仔細的解答申報讀者要知道（中國的病在那裏？）的人，不曉得國家和政府的定義的人，恐怕很多，先生不必等他們去研究了現代政治學說）再來討論和解答呢！讀者顧問欄　緣起裏，我記得有這樣一句話（任何人都有解答問題的義務）先生你就盡了這個義務罷！</p>
<p>前幾天的讀者顧問欄裏，發表的　篇文章，兩張同時拿起對看，不禁使我莫明其妙了，本來在下是第三者，根本摸不着這其中玄奥，是没有饒舌必要的，不過在這中國的病在那里這個大題目之下，看到了些不關痛癢不着邊際與題目驢唇不對馬嘴的惡辯眞是可笑可驚</p>
<p>現在中國到甚麽時期了，外侮日急，内政不修，雖然政府當局的意見暫時爲日本而合作，但究竟能不能合作到底呢？加以天災人禍，帝國主義的深入，農村經濟破產，敎育，政治，尤其是財政，何止千瘡百孔！不想商討一點辦法，預備供政府採納或藉此喚醒沉醉中的同胞，指示大衆的出路，作黑夜中的路燈迷途人的指南針，斟字酌句有甚麽用處，這塊並不是乂文社的出品，專講究文字的，這里是實際而而身的問題啊！講了半晌，究竟中國的病在那里，我可以作一最簡單而最明白的解答，那就是在四萬萬人心中的一轉念間，只得要四萬萬人的心中，都存着向上的念頭，那麽中國這一塲大病便會很快的好起來，不信麽，請看德意志當歐戰以後是如何的疲乏，那些約國所限制他的條約是不是比現在中國的處境遠難，但是他們國内的民氣不死，人人都想向上，經過十三四年努力的結果，德國竟回復戰前的健康了，所以我說中國的病不怕怎樣難治，不怕怎樣複雜，祇要四萬萬人的心中一轉丨恢復民氣丨便會好了，致於四萬萬人的心，怎樣轉，怎樣向上，那就不是本文所能論及的了，好吧，現在即然說到四萬萬人應當怎樣向上，不妨我也提出一個問題是：全國同胞所應當認識的途徑（復信明日發表）</p>

<h3>大夏勝曁南（男）</h3>
<p>兩隊昨交鋒於中山路大夏大學、兩隊球　均佳、人才出色、、上半時大夏得心應手、頗爲順利、以十八比八分估優下半時曁南努力反攻、球勢頗盛、分數迭見逐上、故競爭益爲激烈、最後結果、僅差二分、比數爲二十七比二十五、曁南以二分慘敗、</p>
<h3>曁南勝大夏（女）</h3>
<p>曁南大夏除男子比賽外、尙有女子比賽、同在一地交戰、上半時曁南女將、共得八分、大夏僅獲一分、下半時形勢平均、雙方均不善投籃、故紀錄頗小、結果曁南以十三比五勝、</p>

<h3>惜哉常勝軍</h3>
<h3>東華竟敗於西捕</h3>
<p>結果零比一　罰球致命傷　表演無精彩</p>
<p>奪得西聨足球甲組錦標之東華足球隊昨對西捕作臨别紀念之西聨甲組比賽最後一次於中華棒球塲、觀衆五六千人咸佈望東華作一個完滿的結束、保持常勝軍的榮譽、安知事與願違、因中鋒李義臣之缺席、致使前鋒力量薄弱、而後方亦時有疏忽之虞、致使西捕於下半時中攻入一球、東華遂以一比零慘敗、至於兩隊表演、均無精彩、故自始至終、難於引起興趣、</p>
<h3>東華陣線前鋒力弱</h3>
<p>昨日東華之敗、殊出於不幸、前後衛人馬、固一仍其舊、未有更動、但前鋒方面、因李義臣之缺席、由陸恩鍾庖代、大爲减色、陸乃守門名將、非前方工作人材、以其脚頭呆板、門路不熟、且守衛方面、似亦無往日鞏固、遂使實力大减、隊伍支配如下、</p>
<p>萬象亭</p>
<p>李寗　　屠開元　　曹秋華</p>
<p>周賢言　　　　　　馮運佑　　陸鍾恩</p>
<p>關洵安　　吳幼良　　陳家球</p>
<p>陳虞添</p>
<h3>西捕隊伍亦不完善</h3>
<p>至於西捕陣線、亦不完整、所勝一球、全屬幸運、前鋒之病翼、俱屬生手赫雷乃前衛良材、今以充左翼用非所長、鮮有建樹、傑克原係右内鋒職、今充右翼、亦較减色、餘如透納德飛、俱屬平庸之輩、前年担任中鋒之法蘭斯、昨突然出塲、任左前衛、當難有如赫雷之穩健、内衛傑勃遜亦平平而已、但守門勃拉特萊、測殊見出色、總之、兩方旣無完善隊伍、自然無美妙之表演、勝負之分、憑諸幸運而已、</p>
<p>法蘭斯　　赫雷</p>
<p>葛勃遜　　　　　　　透納</p>
<p>勃拉特萊　　　　　　　軋　詐　　派克</p>
<p>蕭　脫　　　　　　　德飛</p>
<p>惠斯伍　　傑克</p>
<h3>來來往往局勢平淡</h3>
<p>下午三時、裁判陳吉祥下令動員、西捕開球、彼此逐鹿、射門、一次萬象華高球挑送門前、守門撲成角球、小萬送出、曹秋亭急射、稍高未中、陸鍾恩亦得一次攻門、稍傷成野球、西捕幾次反攻、難於近門、兩次角球、亦未見效、來來往往、生氣極少、均局勢頗爲平淡、</p>
<h3>四次角球枉費心血</h3>
<p>東華曾在敵方連得四次角球先由右面陳虞添踢出爲守門托出後方改由左翼萬象華踢接　二次均爲西捕踢成角球、待第三次送出、被截出前方、均未得利、曾被西捕派克帶球前去、長趨直入、一路無阻、直抵龍門之前、舉足攻門、局賢言勢成孤單、欲救無策、幸而射成野球、否則東華危矣、但此球雖未進門、周賢言之脚、忍被派克帶傷、臥地不起、乃由陸鍾恩代理、未幾周繼續出戰、上半時卽行告終、</p>
<h3>罰任意球東華失守</h3>
<p>休息再戰、東華忽遭危運、李寗在罰球區域線旁手觸球、被罰任意球、由西捕前衛惠斯伍主踼挑送門前、肉摶頗久、忽而球在左方門角上落空、西捕赫雷見機趕上攻門、球爲周賢言稍行拍着未能出遠、仍被赫雷踼入門内、東華遂負一球、離開始僅七八分鐘耳、</p>
<h3>李周口角殊屬不幸</h3>
<p>東華失球後、周賢言與李寗忽發生口角、原因何在、不得而知、而李寗就此半途離塲、披衣外出、未及五分鐘、李因換球鞋重行入塲比賽、查李周二人、同在　踼球有年、今竟發生意見、珠爲不幸、深望捐除成見、言歸舊好、</p>
<h3>東華反攻力不從心</h3>
<p>東華負此球後、全軍憤怒、興師問影、力圖報復、左衝右奪、南征北勦氣熖頗盛、西捕球門、被包圍不散、四面夾攻、虞添家球均有正確射門、但西捕守門勃拉特萊、聲東擊西、應付有方、竟使東華無機可圖、最後十分錄時、東華反受西捕重大威脅、險遭失守、周賢言救出險球不少、時間將終前、萬象華得一角球機會、東華乃作派注之一擲借乎亦不見效、不得不以一比零慘敗、</p>
<h3>算算舊賬作一回顧</h3>
<p>東華足球隊在本季足球節中、凡友誼賽、却令治賽、特别賽史高塔杯賽、以及西聨甲組賽、共計二十六戰、共勝二十三次、先敗兩次、和局兩次、勝球九十三、負球二十六、茲列表如下、作一回顧、留個參考、</p>

<h3>優游勝臘克斯</h3>
<p>上半時各無所得下半時成三比一</p>
<p>優游足球隊昨遇臘克斯於虹口公園、作甲組比賽、以三比一克之、上半時零與零比、陳光耀表演甚佳、臘克斯每况愈下、不堪收拾、裁判員張樂、</p>

<p>勞勃芝　　　　　　凱未爾　海華特</p>
<p>洛　根　　　　　　尼可夫</p>
<p>勃洛特　倍格爾</p>
<p>上半時零比零</p>
<p>初戰四十五分鐘之結果、雙方皆各無所得、此進彼退、此攻彼守、機會失之者有之、攻而不中者有之、三刻完畢、優游零、臘克斯亦零、</p>
<p>奚巧生第一球</p>
<p>下半時開始接觸、十五鐘仍然如此、臘克斯判罰任意球、孫錦順踼之、有力而準、直飛球門、勞勃芝雖然接得、一失手、仍落地上、奚巧生來得凑巧、跑上輕輕撥中、優游先開紀錄、</p>
<p>孫錦順二比一</p>
<p>優游聲勢太振臘克斯一敗激竟起其戰心、中鋒海華特、匹馬盤入、果爲其中、成一比一、優游再下進攻、孫錦順向門、力射、球中洛根之脚、洛根反起一勾、自打自門、球中門去、優游再以二比一在先、</p>
<h3>李碩友竟全功</h3>
<p>最後之十分鐘、優游仍不絕進取、火車頭陳光耀、沿邊綫進攻、遠向左傳、李碩友射進、三比一遂竟全功甲組之中、優游亦一躍而上、</p>
<h3>曁南先勝後敗</h3>
<p>阿伽爾五比一獲勝曁南先中十二碼球</p>
<p>曁南足球隊、昨在逸園與阿伽爾作甲組之常二次比賽、上半時曁南先中一球、但下半時竟在阿伽爾爾猛攻之下、連失五次之多、結果爲五比一阿伽爾又勝、兩方陳線及略况如下、</p>

<h3>突出重圍</h3>
<p>曁南以主將數人之缺席、實力爲减削、江善敬傷腿、羅海光王南珍又以江大籃球不能分身、曁南雖先開球、阿伽爾一下卽行猛烈反攻、麥太維許在門前極好機會、未曾射中、休士亦繼之失之交臂、球時時在曁南陣地盤旋、苦不能出、曁南力守、敵竟不逞、重圍之下、曁南一次給機衝出、顧尙勷射離門三十碼之任意球、力雖猛、球仍彈回、鍾勇森自右而中、一次盤球獨上阿伽之後衛皆陷、球門見闖禍衝出、在鍾可輕輕一蹴而人之球、竟付之流水、大爲可惜、蓋得之殊不易也、</p>
<h3>罰中敵門</h3>
<p>曁南堅壁嚴守後之三十分鐘、曁南二次突圍而出、尹貴義疉破阿伽防線、直抵門前、守門亨透以手捉球球向後飛、反而幾乎彈中、幸陶克斗救出、一而再、再而三、曁南第三次闖關、遂得一罰十二碼球之機會、鍾勇聲沿邊直進、在底線處向中一勾、混亂之中、裁判員發見海斯的手觸皮球、判罰十二碼、顧尙　趕上射入、曁南在惡劣之形勢下、反而先聞紀錄、轉瞬上半時完畢、曁南一、阿伽爾零、</p>
<h3>連失五次</h3>
<p>下半時起、阿伽反攻益烈、仍將曁南之門團圍住、守門徐亨有接應不暇之勢、最後雖告失敗、徐已盡其責、後衛顧尙勷、力敵大軍、功亦當記、曁南在此猛烈壓迫、遂連失五球、開球五分鐘、惠列乘亨衝出在外、射入一球、成一比一之平手、又五分鐘李特勾起一球、徐亨屈身一抓已進、二十分鐘時、麥太維許二十碼遠射、球勢峻急進網、尙餘一刻鐘時、休士向下射門、徐亨向地一仆、奈球已進、最進五分鐘、海氏遠射、徐亨撲出成角球、休士踼來、東風竟吹之入内、亦云奇矣、五比完畢、</p>

<h3>如是我聞的小英雄</h3>
<p>— 膽廬</p>
<p>十　五齡抗是小英雄王貫雲的名字，似乎海上報紙不曾記載；也許已經紀載，而目我未曾過目。我所知道的小英雄的歷史，是在香港循環日報上發現的；這是值得介紹一通，也好興奮我們愛國青年的熱烈情緒。</p>
<p>小英雄，臨榆箱，他是早喪老子的孤兒；爲着富有財產，幼齡時，便習武術自衛；在十一齡時，他的槍擊本領，已使一般老於此道者見了咋舌！九一八事變發生，小英雄年才十三，便知效法古代執干戈以衛社禝的汪童子，組織百餘人的救國團，屢屢襲擊日兵，殺傷七十餘人；只爲，同時有小白龍老北風的抗敵，所以，小英雄的聲名，小能馳騁於四遠。但，從此以後，歸附小英雄的同志很多，未滿一年，小英雄已被舉爲抗日鐵血軍總司令，他的年齡還没有滿足一十四歲。</p>
<p>小英雄旣以毁家購機奮身殺敵爲職志，一二八國難吃緊的時候他在關外，曾率隊奇壟打虎敵軍，獲槍械百餘桿，子彈二千發，麫粉四百五十包，輜重無算。最近，他又率隊投第九旅長崔雲五收編，崔旅長歎其年稚而志壯授以團長職權，全軍中對此十五齡抗日小英雄的王團長個表示着歡迎。這些小史，都是我槪括着港報上的紀載。關外戰爭正在熱烈的當兒，但，不知陸軍騎兵第九旅長崔雲五部下的王團長，現在戰况如何？我希望這位英雄的大名，時時在戰報上轟轟烈烈的記載，好敎全國兒童的顏面上，都是閃閃的輝耀着黄金之色。</p>
<h3>雨的街</h3>
<p>— 人英</p>
<p>雨　，是瀟洒地下着。我是踏着這呢濘的街道，在這悠長的行程彳亍。在愛多亞路林立着小客棧的一帶，這裏有中國精神文明的產物；落拓的星相家（？）凭着鐵欄鷹掠着勞働階級的行人。平日在鐵欄外面，時常繞着面黄肌瘦的一羣，他們對着星相家信口開河的理論；抱着無限的同情與信任。所以這船芙蓉城裏的落拓者，也在勞働階級的汗血中榨取他們生活的一部分。今日爲了馬路間籠罩着灰色的烟雨，駐足的行人消散了；他們對着這飄飄欲仙的雨絲</p>
<p>，大致感到萬分的失望吧！</p>
<p>時間還祇在四點鐘，但是從菜市街經過。一般肉體的零沽者，已站在雨的街頭了。伊們睜大了呆滯的眼瞳，想呑没了一個個孤獨的行人。</p>
<p>乞兒們仍舊戴着歪斜的呢帽，披着破碎的麻袋；跟着每一個趕行程的人囉囌着。他們病夫式的典型，被紅丸消磨了的臉頰，並不會得到人的憐憫，何况在那春雨連綿的空氣中。</p>
<p>賣夜報的孩子，喊啞了喉嚨；儘在那雨的街頭躑躅。他們高喊着駭人的警句，想吸引較多的買者。在這十里洋塲的大都會中，祇有他才點綴着國難的嚴理。</p>
<p>我就在店房的廓下，等候着赴目的地的電車一輛笨重而載滿了乘客的車輛，終於蜿　地來了。車輪的旋轉；濺起了污穢的泥漿。這是祖國前途的象徵，這負有鄭重使命的車輪，或者頻於没落的途上，還是奔向光明的前程？</p>
<h3>都市散記</h3>
<p>— 郭蘭韾</p>
<p>星　期六之夜，是都市的浪漫之夜。在這個晚上，工作覊絆下牽製了一星的人，謀一個盡情的歡叙，因爲明天是星期日，没有時間上後顧之憂，於是星期六的晚上，在都市中成了一個浪漫的夜。</p>
<p>前一個星期六的晚上，我在小樓裏感受到十分寂莫，於是從聖母院路到北四川路去看在北四川路上已經有十二年歷史的張公，大家談了一刻，我們决定到咖啡店去消磨這星期六之夜。</p>
<p>湯白森的斜對過是新開的日光，在日光的北面從一條衖裏進去是全球咖啡店，張公身體很魁梧，年紀已經有三十幾歲，興緻還很好。登樓後，坐了一個房間，有一個女招待出來招待，名字本來是小毛頭，因爲許多意大利兵喊不來這個名字，於是喊成了囂濛，大家也都以囂濛呼之，小毛頭這名字倒不聽見了。伊一口意大利話講得眞好，在伊跟前也有幾個意大利兵結識。</p>
<p>我們喊了二杯咖啡，在淡炧的燈光下喝着。南邊月宫，對面星光，北面大華三個舞塲裏的音樂隱隱吹過來，好像十二闌干，碧城天遠處散落下來的。</p>
<p>後來又有一個憨態可掬的女待過來，名字愛蓮，說話也嘻笑無端，伊什麽也不知道，伊没有靈魂，伊所看見的是有人歡喜伊，會將錢給伊，伊也將人所要的東西交換，今年歡笑復明年，其他是完全不去想的。</p>
<p>喝咖啡我也很歡喜，有時一個人孤獨的坐的咖啡店一角，面前放了一杯咖啡，靜默着看其他許多人的歡娱，别有一番滋味，這是旁人所不了解的，眞如我們在新雅二樓聚會喜坐在樓梯邊一個桌子上，看顧客的男女老幼中外人士的進出，及上海大戲院觀衆散塲一樣。</p>
<p>這時旁邊房間裏又來了一個客人，囂濛去招待，停了一刻，聽見囂濛對那客人說：（你前天答應我的手錶怎樣，今天還没有帶來？）那客人所答的話我們没有聽見·一陣笑聲之後，囂濛出來向櫃上喊兩客咖哩雞飯。</p>
<p>我同張公談了些閒話，看時間已經十二點鐘，於是我們就付了錢出來，到樓梯那邊，又聽見囂濛一陣笑聲傳過來。踏到北四川路，一片紅情緣意，醉人的春宵中，我們好像不是踏在萬方多難的故國了。</p>

<p>編輯室裏掛着的座右銘正面是，（這論自由），反面是，（莫彈國事）。</p>
<p>開門揖盜，拱手奉讓，</p>
<p>這一揖一讓的美德，還是四千年前，我們老祖宗唐虞二帝，遺下來的共和郅治，文明極則。現在又有我們這班賢子賢孫去身體力行，怎不要傲視萬國，獨步千古，博得人家贊一聲：大國民的氣量，直非島夷所能及呢，哈！</p>
<h3>雙槍將</h3>
<p>據　報載：逃將軍湯玉麟，曾以鴉片充餉，可謂别開生面，然則其部下，必皆隱君子無疑矣。以隱君子當士卒，直可稱之爲君子兵，此輩君子兵，臥塌上用烟槍，壕溝内用洋槍，雙槍齊下，勇哉勇哉，不愧人稱爲雙槍將。第不識此輩雙槍將，較之梁山泊忠義堂上，一百零八將中綽號稱雙槍將之董平，又如何也？</p>

<p>第二回</p>
<p>陋室結芳鄰暗欽健叟　　權家擇良伴痛詆貧娃</p>
<p>到　了次日清早，江氏起床之後，就聽到後院有種種響聲，大槪老太爺是早起來了。自已站在院子門邊，伸頭向裏張望了一下。却見老太爺穿了短棉襖，在院子裏打拳。因笑道老太爺，您身體眞好，起來得這樣早，還在院子裏練拳。趙翁抱拳頭拱了兩拱笑道：練慣了，有一天不練，身上就難過。江氏笑道：昨天晚上，還多謝送去那些個白麵饅頭。趙翁道；不成意思。因爲那個山東大饅頭，是昨天新得的，由城裏帶了出來。我想海甸這地方，也許買不到，所以送點您嘗嘗。我聽差老王說，你娘兒倆，整天的彎了頭在屋子裏作活，眞是勤快，我就喜歡這種人。一個人無事，成天閙着花兒粉兒的，自已說是怎樣俊，怎樣美，光吃不做，那就是個大廢人，天底下没這個人不算少，有一個不算多，，江氏笑道：老太爺是古道人，瞧得我們起，其實我娘兒倆也是没有法子。稍微有一點活路，也不這樣苦了十個指頭了。趙翁手摸了鬍子，點點頭道：好丨我進門一瞧你娘兒倆，就知道是好街坊。老太太早上起來寒氣重，我屋子裏來瞧瞧喝一杯熱茶去罷。江氏笑道：逢頭撒腦的，您笑話，待一會兒，我就來。江氏回屋來，燒水洗過臉，就對桂枝道：這位老太爺，爲人實在好，我們瞧瞧他屋子去。桂枝究竟是位姑娘，還丢不了一股子兒童心理，他自從這位鄰居搬來了，就很想去看看，人家家庭，是個什麽樣子？只是自已怕得罪甘二爺，不便去得，現在母親要去心想跟他去一回要什麽緊，笑道：好的，我跟你瞧瞧去。說着這話，找出抽屜裏的小梳子來，將頭髮梳攏了一會，牽了一牽衣襟，笑道：我們一塊兒去罷。於是隨在母親身後，一路到趙翁屋子裏來。那正中屋子裏，也收拾着成了一個客堂的樣子，上面懸了一軸紅臉關羽像，兩邊一副大字對聨，字寫的大大的粗粗的。左邊掛了四條屏上面也是字，每個字用紅格子框着，右壁懸四塊外國人大戰的五彩畫。（一六）</p>

<h3>聰明與朧眼明朦的</h3>
<p>大　凡世界上，挜論那一種東西，由普通朦朧的眼看起來，都没有興趣，若爲由聰明的慧眼看起來，就可以大發明的。譬如牛頓看見蘋果　脫蒂，落在地上，發明了引力的原理。加利雷阿（意大利人）看見燈範摇動，發明振子的原理。（他發明明太陽黑點說）然而幾千萬年以來，看見萍果落下的人，何止幾億萬人，這幾億萬人，因爲都是糊裏糊塗的眼，所以不能發見什麽。爲什麽緣故呢？就是些徵的事，在宇宙間，都有深奥的道理。留心注意的人，一見可以領悟，由領悟中再加進一步去想，就成爲大發明家了。這一點，不但是科學上的發明發見如此，自從古昔人類穴居時代，以至今日，其中經過了幾萬年人類的慧眼考案，才有到今日的文明。試看螞蟻乘於浮在水上的木葉，而想出造船的使用，看見蜘蛛攀藤結網，而想出弔橋的方法。由木船進而爲鐵船，由帆船進而爲輪船，由弔橋進而爲鐵橋，從前說人爲飛到空中，今日竟從理想變成事實了。飛機的發明，打破從前的飛人的謎，種種發明改良都靠人類聰明慧眼的力。所以諸君在無論何時何地，映到眼簾廟的東西，都可以開發我們的聰明孔吧。</p>
<h3>數字遊戲問答</h3>
<p>某　牧塲中的主人，混合牛羊　馬，以四千元買了百隻，牛每隻四百元，驢馬每隻百二十元，羊每隻二十元，問此人所賢百隻中，有幾隻牛？</p>
<p>幾隻羊？幾隻驢？幾隻馬呢？</p>
<p>（答）牛馬隻，驢馬一隻，羊九十四隻。</p>
<p>（問）上圖之中，有幾個正方形？請仔細數數看。</p>
<p>（答）二十二個。</p>
<p>（問）照上圖（一）的七個圓圈排列數之，直爲三圈，横爲五圈，但有何法能齣排列到縱數爲五圈，横數亦爲五圈呢？</p>
<p>（答）就是把中央的圈上重疉兩圈，（把左右邊的圈加到中央的圈上）變成（二）圖的樣子了。</p>
<h3>摇頭的表示</h3>
<p>母　烏喂小鳥吃的時候，若是小鳥閉了嘴，左右摇動他的頭時，就是小島的肚子已飽，表示不要吃的形狀。也有小鳥飢餓的時候，雖張開了嘴，因爲所喂的東西，是不喜歡或是污穢的，它也要摇頭閉嘴的，小孩們也是這樣，做母親的，用筷夾了食物送到嬰兒的口邊時，若是肚子已飽不想吃，他必定閉嘴摇頭。所以嬰兒漸漸長大起來，無論什麽事情，碰到（不想）（不要）的時候，就以摇頭爲表示，變成習慣了。</p>
<h3>狗追汽車</h3>
<p>狗　當野生的時候，蹲踞在洞裏，窺伺外面有没有可吃的東西走過，若是見了鹿山羊等動物，它必定突然追出洞來。有時候比它身體大的動物，跑過它的洞邊，狗以爲怕它而逃的它也没命的追去。所以汽車飛駛過去的時候。它也不顧什麽的去追，我們看見跑狗塲裏用電兔引狗跑的理由，就是狗看到兎正合它的嗜好，都想食之而甘心，於是拚命的向前追逐了。</p>

<h3>迎頭經</h3>
<p>— 何家斡</p>
<p>中　　國現代聖經丨迎頭經日：（我們要迎頭趕上去，不要向後跟着）。傳曰：追趕總史有向後跟着，普通是無所謂迎頭追趕的。然而聖經决不會錯更不會不通，何况這個年頭一切都是反常的呢。所以趕上偏偏說迎頭，向後跟着，那就說不行！現在通行的說法是：（日軍所至，抵抗隨之），至於收復失地與否，那麽，當然（旣非軍事專家，詳細計畫，不得而知）。不错呀，日軍所至，抵抗隨之），這不是迎頭趕上是什麽！日軍一到，迎頭而趕（）：日軍到瀋陽，迎頭趕上北平；日軍到閘北，迎頭趕上眞茹；日軍到山海關，迎頭趕上塘活；日軍到承德，迎頭趕上古北口　以前有過行都洛陽，現在有了陪都西安，將來還有（漢族發源地）崑崙山丨丨西方極樂世界。至於收復失地云云，則雖非軍事專家亦得而知焉，於經有之，日（不要向後跟着）也。證之已往的上海戰事，每到日軍退守租界的時候，就要（嚴飭所部切勿越租界一步）。這樣，所謂迎頭趕上和勿向後跟，都是不但見於經典而且證諸實騐的眞理了。右傳之一章。</p>
<p>傳又曰：迎頭趕和勿後跟，還有第二種的微言大義丨丨</p>
<p>報載熱實况曰，義軍皆極勇敢，認擾亂及殺戮日軍爲興奮之事　　唯張作相接收義軍之消息發表後，張作相旣不親往撫慰，勢湯又停止供給義軍汽油，運輪中斷，義軍大都失望，甚王有認替張作相立功爲無謂者）。（日軍旣至凌源，其時張作相已不在，吾人聞訊出走，熱湯扣車運物已成目擊之事實，證以日軍從未派飛機至承德轟炸　　　可知承德實爲妥協之放棄（，（張慧冲君在上海東北難民救濟會席上所談）。雖然據張慧冲君所說，（享名最盛之義軍領袖，其忠勇之精神，未能悉如吾人之意想），然而義軍的兵士的確是極勇敢的小百姘。正因爲這些小百姓不懂得聖經，所以也不知道迎頭式的策略。於是小百姓自已，就自然要碰見迎頭的抵抗了：熱湯放棄承德之後，北平軍委分會下令（固守古北口，如義軍有欲入口者，卽開槍迎擊之）。這是說，我的（抵抗）只是隨日軍之所至，你要換個樣子去抵抗，我就抵抗你：何况我的退後是預先約好了的，你旣不肯妥協，那就只是（不要你向後跟着），而要把你（迎頭趕上）梁山了。右傳之二章。</p>
<p>詩云：惶惶大軍，迎頭而奔，（嗤嗤）小民，勿向後跟！賦也</p>
<h3>阿虎</h3>
<p>— 裘鵬</p>
<p>舉起鋤頭，一下子打進那鬆的泥土裏，他，阿虎猛可的抬起頭來，瞧見塘路上一頂轎子飛來，認得轎裏的是桂寳，忙裝起一副恭敬的笑臉招呼他：（三老爺回來了？）</p>
<p>那個人却正眼兒也不瞧他一眼的過去了！</p>
<p>三月的太陽照着阿虎的背，他國到有點不舒暢的烘熱，他倚着鋤柄暫時歇歇力忽然，他又想起了他那死了的爸爸的那句話：咱們是奴才，他們是主子，你怎好跟他們做對頭呢？）十多年前斷片的往事隨着那句話回到他的眼前來啦：</p>
<p>那時他才十一歲，他爸爸在村裏唯一的大地主樹福太爺家做長工；媽媽在家裏給人編編草鞋，紡紡紗。他自已，跟村裏幾十個頑皮孩子在倪家祠堂一個紅鼻頭先生處讀書。那是一個由祠堂的公欵舉辦的小學校，村裏人讀書不要錢，所以在那裏幾乎全是一些窮苦人家的孩子，除了很少的幾個，譬如，桂寳，他是樹福太爺的第三個孫子，就是這很少幾個中之一！</p>
<p>桂寳和阿虎是同級，人生得矮小，乾　，正和樹福太爺一個模型兒。阿虎却高個兒，有力氣，人又聰明，所以在校裏阿虎就是王。不但全校的學生，就連那個紅鼻頭先生也奈何他不得。他公開的受一羣孩子們的糖果的賄賂，代他們寫字，做文章。可是，他們就不同桂寳好。桂寳是這一羣孩子們敵視和欺弄的唯一的對象。常常的，他們把樹福太爺扒大媳婦的灰，生出桂寳來這一件醜事，編成了一隻歌謡，由阿虎領頭一，二，三，大夥兒圍住了桂寳唱：（烏龜，烏龜，稻草煨煨！阿翁扒灰，扒出個什麽？扒出個桂寳小烏龜）。桂寳每次總是哭着回去：許多孩子們却跳着脚笑。</p>
<p>但到晚上阿虎回到家裏，他就得挨爸爸的打。爸爸老是那麽嚴厲的警誡：他一你這小鬼！你再去欺侮桂寳官，我就揍死你。咱們是奴才，他們是主子，你（怎好跟他們做對頭呢？）阿虎總不明白，爲什麽爸爸要那樣帮别人呢？</p>
<p>而今，爸爸死了。阿虎長大了。他繼續着爸爸做别人的奴才而桂寳却已在什麽大學畢了業，在外面做了官呢。阿虎纔明白了爸爸所說的奴才和主子，畢竟是有着怎樣一個不同的界域。他想起了幾年來受主子的虐待，想起了方纔桂寳那種高傲的態度，爸爸的話重又在他的心裏激起了一股憤怒。</p>
<p>（媽的咱們就這麽一輩子做别人的奴才了嗎？）他丢下了鋤頭！</p>
<h3>鄕居隨筆</h3>
<p>— 陳醉雲</p>
<p>俘匪的老故事</p>
<p>一　　位在水警界供職的朋友，因爲出來公幹，順道過訪，談了一些别後的情形之後，我問他道：（現在各處地方，刦案很多；看了報上的新聞，搶刦時總是數百人或數十人爲甚麽到了破獲時，却每每祇一兩個人呢？）那位朋友笑着，摇摇頭，率直地說：（那破獲的一兩個，也並不是眞正刦犯，這是强盜養着的豬哩！）</p>
<p>我詫異着問：（怎麽呌做强盜養着的豬？）</p>
<p>他說：（一個地方出了刦案之後，强盜是逃之天天了，上級機關照例有公事來催，必須嚴緝破案否則，將受懲戒。公事一次一次下來，確實非常爲難。這爲難的情形，强盜也知道了，他們不安起來，便弄兩個三四等的小嘍囉，平時當受津貼而未出過力的，命令他們帶兩枝廢槍，摇一隻船到甚麽地方；一方面再設法報告水警機關，某日某時，某地方有一隻匪船，就是曾刦某處的要犯。於是一捉便着，犠牲了這兩隻（豬），大家都一安無事了。）</p>
<p>我驚歎着：（原來是這麽一回事嗎！）他說：（這是歷來的老故事，一（點不算希奇。中國的政治，原是整個的（報銷公事），無論對上下，祇要有個報銷就算了。若講實事求是，那眞是門外漢哩！）</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路</h3>
<p>— 張貫平</p>
<p>朱先生說了後，又吁一口氣。聽見朱先生那樣地長吁短嘆，又看見他說話說得那樣神秘的樣子，海泉一點也摸不着頭緒，一刻没有回話，只是向着朱先生表示出疑問的神氣。（學校裏的同學，派别分歧，眞是呌我們當敎授的無法應付。願得哥哥，便逆了嫂嫂　　　）朱先生說話，眞呌海泉聽着急死了。他想，朱先生爲什麽不用報告式，直截了當，把事情的原委說出來呢。</p>
<p>（我敎英文難不算頂刮刮，但總不算壞吧？）</p>
<p>（先生敎英文是很可以的。不過，不要去担任文藝的的科學。因爲語言文字事和藝術是兩道的。同學並没有說先生的英文不好，只是說先生對於文學完全是門外漢。）（　　　　　　　）</p>
<p>朱渭這摸着他的下　上的鬚菰，不很願意般地點了點首。這明白地是表示他不能接受海泉的忠告，但又不便當面斥駁海泉的話。</p>
<p>（這也不盡然。　　　　　　）</p>
<p>朱先生仍然摸着鬚菰，微點了點首。</p>
<p>（　　　　其實這是左派學生Ｓ社一班青年所利用的口實。他們說我反動啊！）</p>
<p>朱先生說到反動二字，聲音特别高，（反）字音也特别拖得畏。</p>
<p>（如果是眞的話，的確是無聊，動不動以反動兩個字，故入人罪。）</p>
<p>（你這句話確是公允之論！）</p>
<p>朱先生這次似乎很歡快股地笑了，也頻頻地點首，表示贊成海泉的說話。</p>
<p>（你要帮我的忙喲密司脫林。我將來總有機會酬勞你的。）</p>
<p>（朱先生，不要客氣，不過你要我怎樣帮忙呢？）</p>
<p>（你，第一，替我扛聽一下他們，丨丨丨屬於Ｓ社的份子，是不是决意要攆走我，有没有挽回的餘地。第二，你要替我向他們疏通一下，說朱渭道到底是個好人，對於政治絕無成見</p>

<h3>巴黎談屑</h3>
<p>— 蕭石君寄自巴黎</p>
<p>（五）柏格森的逸事和他的論劇</p>
<p>我　　們知道法國極派巨子讓若列斯（Ｊｅａｎｊａｉｉｒｅｓ）在歐戰要開以前竭力倡非戰論，結果受了槍擊，他的生命可說是爲他的始終一貫的主義喪失的。他在師範學校和柏格森同過學。一九二八年柏格森得到諾貝爾奬金的時候，巴黎有名的文學週報曾出了一期禮讚柏格森的專號。薄劉爾ＬｅｖｙＢｒｕｈｌ發表了一篇簡短的文字，卽是叙述柏格森和讓若列斯在師範學校同學的逸事。那時他們兩人在學校裏的成續都很好，又都好辯論，因此頗爲同學所注目。讓若列斯是一個肥矮的人，一開口便滔滔不絕，夾着法國南部的口音因爲聲音，宏亮的原故，全校都聽得到。柏格森比較瘦弱，態度非常温雅，當讓若列斯如長江大河傾瀉的時候，柏格森能用簡明扼要的語句和他對抗，衆聽感到十分的趣味。所以祇要他們一開始辯論，他們的周圍便齊集了許多人。但他們兩人是極相得的朋友。他們都愛讀荷，馬阜吉爾，雨果及當代詩人的著作。他們有時一同到罏浮宫去看各種美術品。</p>
<p>柏格森以哲學家而得諾貝爾的文學奬金絕不是奇怪的事。因爲他對於文藝有透徹的理解。現摘錄他一段論劇的文字就可知道。他說（劇所探出而顯明地暴露給我們看的實在，許多是從我們實際生活上的利害打算不得不竭力隱藏下去的東西。所有的詩不外表現我們的精神狀態，而我們最猛烈最强暴的精神狀態，是在人與人相接觸時所產生的，寃如陰陽電池相接觸時所放出的閃光一般。人與人相接觸時或生出强烈的吸引，或生出强烈的排斥，當其完全失却平衡的時候，遂產生所謂Ｐａｓｓｉｏｎ的靈電。如果人全憑生來的感情衝動，毫不遵守社會的法則或道德的法則，那末，强暴的感情的爆發，會成爲日常茶飯了。但我們要緩和這種爆發，從實際生活上的利害打算出發，人不得不服從社會的法則和道德的法則。於是我們有義務和責任。由這二重的影響，我們的思想感情漸具一層外殻，這外殻的養成，卽由於我們想樹立一個萬古不易的法則，以期人人共守，免得人與人間常因激情的爆發而起衝突。但我們的激情如果不能完全消滅，我們自不得不竭力隱藏下去，而我們的思想感情的外殻，便因之硬化起來。這正像地球以那漸次冷去的薄皮包裏地心的猛火。但地球常有火山爆發的事，假若地球眞如神話所說，也是一個生物，那火山的爆發儘可看作是地球的歡喜，正同我們在睡眠的時候感到自已最内在的激情所生的歡喜一般。劇給我們的快感，卽是這種地球的歡喜。）</p>
<p>柏格森又說（把赤祼裸的自然啟示給我們，乃是藝術的最高的目的。）這卽是說藝術須直接地去看實在。這種實在早已不是從前槪念上所假設的客觀的實在，而是和個性的純粹素樸的精神狀態相肉摶時所把捉的實在。這是近代一切藝術共同之點。近代哲學和藝術的異彩，卽是不忽視個人眞實僞的本能與衝動。個人眞寳的本能與衝動，或由叡智所產生的活力，足以抉破旣成的宗敎和道德的藩籬。以這種哲學爲基礎的近代戲劇，自然時常描寫那些憑藉一已最内在的活力去與旣成的宗敎和德相肉摶時所產生的夺惱。往日戲劇所描寫的也常是人生的苦惱。不過往日戲劇中人物苦惱的來源，是悔恨自已的脆弱，違背了旣成的宗敎和道德。近代戲劇中的人物，則常有旣成的宗敎和道德祇是一副毫無内容的假面具，壓迫純粹的眞實的人性，所以近代戲劇中人物的態度多是奮門的反抗的。對於社會組織乃至社會習慣，常有激烈批評。我們讀易卜生史特林堡諸人的作品，更佩服柏格森的透視力，所以有人說近代戲劇的基礎，實建築在富有幸命精神的近代哲學上面。</p>

<h3>汪院長定今晚入京</h3>
<p>對復職不再堅辭　　路局已備車待發</p>
<p>行政院長汪精衛氏、自力疾返國抵滬後、即於昨晨趨訪立法院長孫哲生氏、討論外交等各種要務、汪氏於今晨九時三十分、由亞爾培路褚宅趨車赴愚園路訪蔡元培氏、暢談半小時許、辭出後、因連日海行勞頓、乃驅車至滬西一帶曠野、呼吸新鮮空氣、於十時四十分返褚宅、茲誌其詳情如次、</p>
<h3>復職無問題</h3>
<p>汪氏前因病呈請辭職、俾便出國療治、中央以當内憂外患交迫之秋、期望於汪氏者甚重、故特給假出國治療、汪氏現在病已較痊、對於復職問題、雖於抵滬時表示仍請宋代院長負責、但連日經各方懇請、汪氏已不再堅辭、擬今晚入京、與在京中委會晤後、即可復職、</p>
<h3>備專車晋京</h3>
<p>據中央社記者探悉汪院長·宋代院長·及實業部長陳公博·鐵道部長顧孟餘·交通部長朱家驊·鐵次曾仲鳴·中政會秘書長唐有壬·行政院秘書長褚民誼·内次甘乃光·等、均定今晚夜車晉京、路局已備專車數輛、升火待發、又悉宋宅已通知路局備花車一輛、以便汪氏乘坐云、</p>
<h3>曾仲鳴訪宋</h3>
<p>汪氏抵滬伊始、私務繁多、又因急須入京、故今晨十時許、特派鐵次曾仲鳴訪宋代院長、有所洽商、</p>
<h3>孫科後日晚車返京</h3>
<p>與于右任提統一軍事案</p>
<p>中委孫科、此次由京來滬、已於昨晨在其私邸、與汪氏會見、除叙舊外、略及黨政軍事、現孫氏定二十一日晚車返京、聞氏以抗敵軍事、形勢緊急、與中委于右任諸氏、曾有一軍事統一計畫提案、原則已送交中央、至全案於二十三日付中政會議討論、</p>

<h3>方本仁定明後日晉京</h3>

<h3>痛告政府</h3>
<h3>蒙古將非我有</h3>
<p>各盟旗王公多服從中央　　蒙代表主改組蒙藏委會</p>
<p>内蒙古各盟旗駐京代表現任監察委員白端、軍事委員會參議德克吉訶、蒙古文化促進會劉占一等、來滬歡迎汪精衛回國、并對蒙事有所請願、今晨新聲社記者訪之於旅邸、詢以蒙古現狀及來滬任務、蒙詳答如左</p>
<h3>内蒙盟旗</h3>
<p>蒙古本分内外兩部、今外蒙</p>
<p>久已獨立、暫時與中央無關係、固置不論、内蒙原有盟二獨立旗二特别部、每盟所轄旗數不等、六盟共五十三旗、合獨立旗特别部在内共五十七旗、分居綏遠察哈爾熱河及遼吉黑三省之西部、人口總數約五百餘萬、</p>
<h3>已失半數</h3>
<p>自九一八瀋變之後、東北淪亡、於是在遼吉黑三省之哲盟及呼倫貝爾特别部、伊克明安獨立旗、即入於日人勢力之下、至本年勢河失陷、卓昭兩盟又在敵騎之下、今僅存察哈爾綏遠兩省境内之錫烏伊三盟及察哈爾特别部、曁土默特獨立旗而已、</p>
<h3>蒙人態度</h3>
<p>蒙旗在東三省之盟旗、雖淪陷於敵騎、以勢力相懸、莫由抵抗、但蒙人對日態度、極爲堅决、日人原意本擬組織滿蒙傀儡僞國因蒙人無肯爲利用者故未能實現、僅稱滿洲國、其後各　旗王公代表鑒於日人進窺熱冀之危機、於去年十二月間、聨袂晋京、請願整理内蒙之方案、中央亦甚關心而表同情、</p>
<h3>上下隔閡</h3>
<p>中央主管蒙事之最高機關爲蒙藏委員會、而主持會務者、對蒙古情形旣無所知、似對内蒙之興衰、無關痛癢、對各盟旗王公代表之建議、竟來之高　、　無　白、本年熱河失陷前後、各盟旗亦迭有來電、報告　　、但均留置於蒙藏委員中、故各盟旗對中央難或德意、然於蒙事無所改進、頗爲失望也、</p>
<h3>謁汪請願</h3>
<p>余等此次來滬歡迎汪精衛先生、并請願中央改進蒙政、改組蒙藏委員會、一摕現在中央之預　狀態、而地方意見、務使得達中央、以袪隔閡、昨日進謁汪氏、汪極表贊同、</p>
<h3>盟旗組織</h3>
<p>内蒙各旗盟、雖半數淪陷、其餘亦瀕臨戰區、甚形危險、然對日熊度、均極堅决、誓不願作亡國奴、家盟旗制度、本爲軍事組織、基本組織爲佐、佐領統壯丁五百人、四佐爲甲設參領、每旗包括甲數不等、自六七甲至十餘甲不等、盟爲各旗每年會操之名、純爲軍事制度、現在亦有相當之新式武器、未嘗不可一用也、</p>
<h3>外蒙進步</h3>
<p>内外蒙古本同一族、宗敎習慣完全相同、外蒙獨立多年、政府回無時不思收撫、但必内蒙有辦法後、始能奏效、劉占一曾於民國十三年十七年兩次至外蒙考察、其政治經濟文化、莫不蒸蒸日上、確有新國家無象、反視内蒙日漸進步、欲說外蒙内附、殊無從啓齒也、深望中央積極改善内蒙談政、以爲收復外蒙之基礎、云</p>
<h3>交部令郵局</h3>
<h3>在熱邊設臨時郵局</h3>
<p>與抗日軍隊同進退</p>
<p>據本埠郵局消息、自承德失陷後、熱河全省郵局、非被日軍佔奪、即停止辦公、現交部當局爲求戰事消息傳遞敏㨗起見、特令飭郵局、在熱邊各抗日軍隊内、附設臨時郵局、隨軍進退、並須节實取得聨絡、其辦法悉依照封鎖東北郵政成例、郵局奉令後、頃已轉令留熱郵員、迅速組織成立以利戎機云、</p>
<h3>二批運滬</h3>
<h3>古物明晨抵埠</h3>
<p>昨日報載、二批南運古物、業已由浦口裝運來滬、明日（即今日）當可到達云云、大通社記者、今晨特赴招商局詢問該項古物到滬時刻、據云、二批南運古物、於十七日晚始由平運抵浦口、至今晨始交由招商局快利輪轉裝來滬、約於明日上午十時許、始可到達上海、外傳今日到滬說、係屬不確、</p>
<h3>市商會呈財部</h3>
<h3>請修正報紙進口稅</h3>
<p>改從量稅爲從價稅</p>
<p>市商會昨呈財政部云、呈爲呈請事、案於本月十八日、接紙業同業公會函稱查民國十九年十二月二十九日國民政府公布之進口報紙稅率第十類第五一三號、（甲）捲筒者每担關金一元五角、（乙）其他（即裝件者）每担關金一元六角、旋於二十一年十一月間、）又將捲筒裝之　紙改爲　百抽七·五、規定公布在案、查現市報紙每噸價格約值　金八十六元、以第五一三號、（甲）項值百抽七·五計算、應稅關金六元四角五分、以（乙）項每担關金一元六角之規定計算則每噸應納關金二十六元八角八分、相差竟四倍有零、查報紙用途、捲筒者多爲申報新聞報等資本雄厚設備周全之各大報館所用、裝件者多爲本本外埠小資本之各小報館排印新聞曁書局印刷敎科書及圖書雜誌等用、夫同一貨物、同爲宣傳文化之必需品、而稅率則高下不同、殊非事理之平、爲此具函報告、請鈞會鑒察、准予轉呈國民政府財政部稅則委員會、將第十類第五一三號報紙稅率（甲）（乙）兩項、修正爲槪微收值百抽七·五、庶免軒輊、而絕流弊、實爲公便等語到會、查進口報紙一項、旣爲傳佈文化之需徵稅不應過高、上年十一月間、規定爲值百抽七·五、即係此旨惟以捲筒報紙、改爲從價徵稅、而裝件之報紙、仍舊從量徵稅、遂致同一報紙、而裝件者竟較捲筒者稅重四倍、是使資本較小之文化事業、轉蒙不利、殊有予以改正之必要、理合據情備文轉呈、仰祈鈞部鑒核、俯准將第五一三之乙項進口稅、亦照甲項改爲值百抽七·五之從價徵稅、以泯偏枯、實爲公便、</p>

<p>女職員生活專號（上）</p>
<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3>她是產生新民族的母親</h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>讀者諸君：今日民族的危機，不在少數軍閥官僚苟日偷安的不抵抗主義，而在大多數國民的缺乏民族意識，反抗精神，頽唐不振，意志消沉，男的如此，女的更加如此。我們要來補救這種現象，除了一切治標的救急鼓勵，外尤應注意注於整個民族意識的培養問題。而在研究培養的問題以前，先要知道大多數國人的生活狀况，然後纔有所根據而謀所以培養的步驟。我們現在姑以上海的範圍爲對象來討論，上海的大多數人爲工爲商，所以本刊的内容遂側重於工商界職工生活的研究與改進方法的討論。</p>
<p>在過去短時期的經騐中，我們深感到所謂意志消沉，頽唐不振的民族精神關係於家庭敎育的方面很大，很大因爲家庭敎育的先生是母親，不是父親。這是使我們注意到女職工生活狀况的原因。至於不出一般的婦女專號，而出這小範圍的女職工專號的理由，乃是：</p>
<p>第一，因爲本刊的對象是職工，而那些不做生產事業的婦女是終日有閒，無所謂業餘，故不在本刊範圍以内；</p>
<p>第二，原來我們的工字和職字範圍，本可不以在工廠做工的女工及女店員等爲限，在其他事業方面服務的，也是一樣的得稱爲工爲職，所不同的，只不過因爲所收到的稿件，多半是屬於女工和女店員方面罷了。</p>
<p>我們看到上海一班女工和女職員的生活狀况以及連想到負有最初一部份復興民族的工作丨家庭敎育丨的全國大多數婦女們的現况時，我們就不覺對　民族的前途，表示無限的危懼，我們不量力，不問這聲音是如何的微小，發刊這幾期女職工專號，是要促起以亡國爲慮，以復興民族爲念的國人的注意，希望在這火燒到眉毛纔發現民族精神是十二分衰弱的時候，不要忘記了她是產生新民族的母親！我們應如何來改進她們的生活，健全她們的體格，啓發她們的智識，培養他們產生新民族的基本能力呀！</p>
<p>大衆生活</p>
<h3>電刑</h3>
<p>— 萍女士</p>
<p>電話局女司機</p>
<p>那正是深秋底時節　　我經濟獨立的開始同時，也是我健康損失的開始！那時我是乂電話局裏一個新進的女練習生，策一次坐上張鐵裂的活動椅子那椅子，特别的高，初坐很不受用。同時頭上要戴上一條一寸多闊彎彎的鐵片，鐵片兩端各懸着一個聽筒，將兩隻耳朶壓得緊緊地，彷佛是一個聾人兒。假使有人離了我們一丈多遠說話時，那就一點都聽不清楚了，那兩個聽筒連着那條鐵片足有兩磅多重，初戴上的時候，眞會使你目眩頭暈到不堪呢！除了這些工具之外，　　間還要用一條寛　掛着一個呌情。</p>
<p>我们的以那工具戴好了，就像貓候老鼠般的嚴守着機號，因爲每個人都要管一百多號數，尤其是我們是練習生，偶一不愼，就會忽略了用戶的來電的。的我練習時間多數是在早七點至午十二點或晚五點至十點止。在早班的時候，我六時三十分就得往電話局，這樣到了那裏尙可稍息數分鐘；不然的話，假使跑了些路馬上就戴着那些刑具似的工具，那眞是要命的呵！</p>
<p>後來，漸漸地，電話局的女司機是日多一日了。自然我是練習生中比較熟練者，故改爲隔天要值一次中班。值中班最是使人害怕，一來電就十多號，任你怎樣的敏㨗，也會手忙脚亂的。</p>
<p>啊！啊！總之，我們是整天不停地（哈囉！哈囉！）的呌着，耳朶裏受着（轟隆！）轟隆！）的電流的震擊，有時甚至會把頭腦轟擊得暈了過去！</p>
<p>我的身體還好，受了幾個月的罪精神還是很蓬勃的，但有幾個不很健康的同事們，就被病魔弄得不亦樂乎了。於是請病假的日多一日，但局規不許你隨便請假的，如你的確是病了，那你還得有醫生的證明書纔准你告兩三天的假，不然的話，你還想偷一刻鐘的懶麽？</p>
<p>局規一天天嚴格起來定了，許多這樣的罰例：如有遲到值班一刻鐘者，就記小過一次，遲到半點鐘的，記大過一次，遲到一小時的，扣一天工錢，全班不到值的，就無條件地開除，又兩個小過併作一個大過，記兩個大過者則列入開除之例。</p>
<p>此外還有各種各樣的臨時罰例：在整整五個鐘頭都是（哈囉！哈囉！）地呌着，喉嚨是會呌破的。你若找不到一個帮忙的同事來替代，就毅然離開機位去喝一口開水，那就要扣你五塊工錢了！呀！多苦呀！我們此時眞不知要錢好還是要命好呢！還有，在陰沉沉的深春時，電話要受很大的影響，使打電話的人們常常打不通，這在局外人只知道責備司機的不良，其實大部份是應歸咎於機線的不精的，不過我們處於這個境地　，又怎有辯解的餘地呢？像有時遇着什麽要人打不通電話時，那就倒霉了！他們一封信來，局裏就認起眞來，去調查某日某時某生所值某號某座的機，待查出來了，那位司機就要被記一個大過或扣五无工錢！呵！請想想，連腦液都被電流烤涸了，僅僅獲得那一月十二塊錢的我們，如果每月被罰三次，那怎樣有錢去塡補呢？</p>
<p>同事們請病假的一天天多起來，多數是患頭痛，竟有兩位是吐血的險症！局裏祇給那兩位十天的假，其餘的還得待派人到她們家裏調查後綫答覆。</p>
<p>呵！吐血和頭痛病底恐怖差不多無時不在我的腦海中環繞着！此外，還有一個可怕的印象，那就是那個殘癈了的男領班，他常常會不知不覺的暈倒地上！聽說這病是當了三十多年的接線生的縷果，現在他雖然由可機而升到領班了，薪俸也不過是一百元，而那寳貴的健康也就此犠牲了！</p>
<p>唉！我害怕的事情也降臨了！每天在值班的時候，我的腦中非常地劇痛！。那些骨喇，骨喇的電流不知輕重地擊着我的耳鼓，那眞是使我害怕到萬分。眞的我近來感覺到自已的記憶力漸漸的遲鈍我的健康已完全失去但是，爲飢餓所驅迫着的我，在現代資本主義社會制度之下，又有什麽辦法呢？</p>
<p>業餘咖啡</p>
<h3>男職員底恐怖</h3>
<p>— 草重</p>
<p>（現在世界眞不是世界！）老王深深地嘆了一口氣說：將來我倡男子總有没飯吃的一天罷！就拿我們那家公司來說，在十年前那裏有什麽女職員？現在呢，你看看，樓上，樓下，到處都是女子，那些男的呢，都不知道到什麽地方去了。剩下來的我們，要算是鳳毛麟角，不過也總有一天會被她們擠掉的。將來，男的都回家去抱小孩子，索性把這世界都交給女子了吧！我眞不　，現在的人，爲什麽都喜歡用女子，這都是人心變了，世界不是世界的緣故啊！）</p>
<p>老王說過了之後，又深深地嘆了兩口氣，來表示他心中的積怨。是的，老王的公司是這樣，其他的公司又何獨不然呢這兩年來，社會上的女店員，好像雨後春筍般的風起雲湧，但這並不是奇特的現象，而是有牠的來由的這正表示着：中國封建經濟制度的勢力是加速度的在崩壞，歡美資本主義經濟制度的勢力很迅速的衝進了中國的領域。</p>
<p>原來在資本主義經濟制度之下，勞動力變成了一種商品商品。價格便宜的易於出賣，勞動力代價低賤的，也就易於被僱。於是，女工擠掉了男工，童工又擠掉了女工，勞動力的代價日益低賤，失業的羣衆也就日益廣大。當然，男職員也難逃出這個定律，而終於要遭了（那我們終要被她們擠掉）的命運。</p>
<p>再呢，女子的性格要比男子的爲馴良，換一句話說，就是女子比男子易於駕馭，而且她們還有一種（招徠顧客）的副作用，所以老板，大班，經理先生　　　都覺得僱用女子要比男子合算得多了，這是女店員風起雲湧的第二個原因。</p>
<p>眞的，女店員就這樣的風起雲湧了。</p>
<p>老王不知道這是現代經濟制度下所產生的必然結果，錯怪了什（麽人心大變），所以，他終究只是嘆氣。</p>
<p>要使女子爲社會服務而擠掉男子的飯碗，那只有到制度不同的另一個世界裏去找罷！</p>
<h3>笑呀！笑呀！</h3>
<p>— 黄女士</p>
<p>女招待在酒家</p>
<p>我不能再想有個男子會來愛我的！</p>
<p>在夜裏，時鐘敲過了八下以後，在晶亮的店室中，受生活壓迫的我們是忙着要客人點酒點菜，打着火熱的手巾送到客人的手裏。他們有許多是漂亮的有錢的青年，一面飲着一杯杯的酒，一面不時的注視着我們。起先我有些驚異，但後來我的一节都麻痺了，只有假笑着騙錢。</p>
<p>（拿手巾來小姑娘！）這些有趣的男人常常這樣呌着。</p>
<p>（哦！來啦！）</p>
<p>他們握手巾的時候總要輕輕的擦着我的手。</p>
<p>（你會喝酒嗎？）</p>
<p>（那裏！嘻嘻！）我作着一個媚笑。</p>
<p>（你今年幾歲了？）</p>
<p>（你猜！猜得着算你乖！）</p>
<p>（十八歲！）</p>
<p>（喔！你怎麽會知道的！）</p>
<p>（哈哈！）</p>
<p>要是這個男人是個蹩脚的傢伙，他也不會來調戲我，而我好好似嚴肅了！因爲調笑也有代價的，最</p>
<p>平常有一塊錢或七八角的酒資。我厭惡着這生活，我想脫離這火坑，但是麫包呢？金錢呢？我也不能再想有個男子會來愛我的！</p>
<h3>經理的外甥</h3>
<p>— 沈千里</p>
<p>發行部女職員</p>
<p>有一天早晨，在我們大都感覺到生活單調的集團裏，居然也有異性光臨，因爲發行部裏新進來了一位女職員，這使我們這間平常很沉寂的寫字間，頓添了不少的生氣。女子畢竟是具有特殊的魔力，或者竟是一種煽動生活的興奮劑吧；我想至少是這樣。許多同事都從不曾像今早這麽興奮最多不過大家互道一聲（早）罷了。的確，今早有點異樣了，一個個走進門時，都很神秘的朝發行部那裏瞥了一眼，彷彿被那張檯子上的磁石吸住了他們的意識似的照例的。一聲（早），大家都比平常說得響亮。各人的神經像是受了劇烈的波動，都毫無顧忌的彼此說笑着，特别是炫耀自已的特長，似乎是在有意無意之間，給與這位新進的女同事一種暗示。</p>
<p>在發行部裏的老王，因他要請一個月的長假，回去結婚，於是在經理的命令之下，把我調到發行部裏補缺。這一來又引起同事間的不平，似乎這個優厚的位置，被我鑽營得來了太不應該因此不時可以聽得他們的冷嘲熱諷。</p>
<p>（喂！老李的艶福可眞是不淺呀！發行部的事情又清閒；而且還可以同那個寡老尋尋開心　　）小王撇轉頭來和老張說</p>
<p>（不是嗎！他媽的，平常我們這裏有誰請了假，總是兩個人的事，併給一個人來做，）做賬的老張，不等他背後的小王說完就搶着說了，意思是咀咒經理的待遇有些不公。</p>
<p>（是呀！發行部的那些貼郵票寫寫信封，有人買東西就招待一下，連瞎子都會做的事情，還要找人去帮忙他媽的，我這裏是忙！起來了，也該找經理去弄個把女　　）小王說到這裏頓住了。（呵喲！算了吧！你這出口部要女人寄到外埠去嗎發行部是因爲要女人做（招牌），（以廣招徠）呢！哈哈！）老張得意的　笑了。</p>
<p>如果說女子的職業就是專做一（花瓶）（招牌）供給　樣的。却也未必盡是如此。在她們的體力上，有的笨重的工作，誠然不及男子勝任愉快：除此以外，却也不見得男子能幹的，她們便不能幹。</p>
<p>譬如密斯趙在發行部裏做的事也並不能說她太少。依我看起來，差不多的男同事有的還應付不了昵。她要招待上門的顧主，又要經理許多外埠來信購貨，同時還要答復人家詢問貨物的時價，這許多複雜而不規一的事情，都是她獨自一人在做。若再要說她是一塊祇是好看不做事的（活招牌），那就未免太寃柱了！</p>
<p>記得我們鄕下有句俗語：（三個人棒一個人好做事，三個人擠一個難事）。我現在仔細玩味這句話，的確是有着顛撲不破的道理。密斯趙就是在這排擠的環境裏犠牲了她的職務。彷彿是那天早晨，我剛跨進辦事室裏，就見她兀自坐着；臉氣得鐵青的在和老張鬥嘴。她說：（你以爲我像你那種卑鄙的思想裏的（花瓶）麽？哼！看你倒像受過高等敎育的人怎麽連自已的人格都不會保守，滿以爲我是可以隨你任意侮辱的，故此拿出馬路上拆白黨的舉動使用到這種地方來了　　）</p>
<p>（算了罷！）密斯趙，都是在一塊兒做事；吵起來不是難爲情嗎？）我看他們吵得不好收塲了，才勸和幾句。</p>
<p>（難爲性，他私自拆我的信就不難爲情嗎？）她憤然的瞥了我一眼。我曉得她是誤會了我的意思。實在我並不曉得老張拆了她的信。我祇瞪着眼睛望着她，在她的氣頭上也無容解釋。幸虧一忽兒經理來了，這塲風波總算暫告平靖。老張是經理的外甥，他的位置比鐵澆的還要堅牢，犠牲的當然的是密斯趙</p>
<p>第二天早晨，發行部裏又是我獨自工作着：老張還不時望着我這邊，呈顯他那得意的笑容。</p>

<h3>二十塊錢</h3>
<p>— 姚英</p>
<p>大百貨公司女職員</p>
<p>在一個暑假期内，日期是糢糊了，瞧見了申報上的一則廣告，　　公司招考女職員，我爲了好奇好的驅使，亦就寄去了一張履歷，及一張最近的照片。隔了不到一禮拜，由郵局寄來了一封掛號信，言明　日　時考試，那時我心裏起了一種異樣的感覺，是喜是罹，一時英辨。</p>
<p>考試的時候，是很平淡的。幾句很並通的英文會話，作文是没有的，但是要寫幾件應用品的名字，珠算是加與乘。還有一椿最難的事情，就是問答廣東話。臨走的時候，有一位穿西裝的說了一句話：Ｃａｎｐａｓｓ後來纔曉得他就是經理。</p>
<p>我得到了這樣的奇遇，便很快樂的禀明了家長，而且自以爲從此可以自立了。不是已經做了女職員嗎？但是現在想來，却很覺可笑。</p>
<p>開始服務的第一天，是星期一。自然，這個日了我不永不會忘記的，因爲隔夜曾經特地去買了一雙新的高跟皮鞋，值價十五塊錢還買了一些零碎的物品，共計三十塊錢，開了我用錢的新紀錢。這大槪是因爲我這樣的想着：從明天起我可以賺錢了，</p>
<p>我是被派在化裝部裏辦事的。頭幾天的工作使我感到麻煩而有與趣，呌了幾百聲的Ｍｒ　，因爲有許多特别名目的貨品，尋不着。那個同事，倒還客氣的。</p>
<p>薪水是二十塊錢，吃他們一頓中飯。辦公時間，自上午九時起至晚間八時止，星期日上午休息。</p>
<p>統計每天的雇客青年男女一對一對來買的，佔百分之六十，單獨女性來買的百份之三十，洋裝革履的男性百份之十老年的與小孩是没有的。</p>
<p>至於日常的生活，除了接受顧客購物外，日惟望着時鐘與來往的顧客以自娱。</p>
<p>總之，我是在熱閙中度着寂寞的生活，而且生活仍不能維持，因此。我到了領得二十塊錢薪水的時候，就辭職了。</p>

<p>言論</p>
<h3>瀕於死亡綫下的她們</h3>
<p>— 文蘭女士</p>
<p>女工在一般人的心目中，都以爲是一種卑賤的職業。然而人們一沉淪到飢餓線下，也就是得不使他們的子女或妻子從事這種被人視爲卑賤的工作　。在這外國資本主義侵蝕到最底層的大都會裏，就連這種被人視爲卑賤職業的，也宣告（座位客滿）了。</p>
<p>基於採用機械的工廠制度確立以後，家庭手工業根本陷於破產的狀態。因而從事家庭手工業的婦女勞動者，不能不很迅速的離開自已的家園，來集合在一定的塲所中，實行集團的某同勞動了。婦女勞動一達到這個階段，便完全變成自由勞動者，把自已的勞動，全部的賣給資本家，甚至她們的肉體，精神，生存，以至於全生命都賣完了。一部過去的婦女勞　史，都是充滿　這種悲慘的内容。</p>
<p>當萬籟俱寂，大地深深的投在死神懷裏，那些興盡意倦從無塲歸來的哥兒小姐們，正在睡眼惺忪，互想擁抱着去追求甜蜜美夢的時候，這些婦女勞動者，手裏提着冰冷的粥飯，托着給資本家剝削榨取乏了的身體，踏着不整齊的步伐，三三兩兩兩兩三三的離開了她們的愛人，抛棄了她們的嬰兒，從靜寂的街頭向工廠裏出發。那蒸氣悶熱的房間裏，許多的機輪在無晝無夜不停的廻轉着。空氣的惡濁，機聲的呌囂，已夠入忍受了。然而她們還要在無情的監督之下，八時，十時，十二時　　　　的拚命工作着，給資本家製造無給價值的剩餘勞動在這樣的情况之下她們的生活簡直不如牛馬，因爲牛馬，還尙有新鮮的空氣，自在的原野，給她們呼吸，享受。所以，她們的健康狀態非常　惡化：那肺病，傴僂等症，也顯示了急劇的增加。又因她們生活的極度惡劣，對於疾病完全失却了抵抗的能力，因之死亡率也佔着驚人的數目。至於敎育問題，就連夢也没有做過。在這個塲合，那道德，羞恥心，都是次要的問題。所以，在許多工作區域裏，男女兩性的亂交，雜交，是一件無可諱言的事實。散工了，好容易散工了。這一批休息了，别的一批又來工作，如此不休的勞動着，榨取着，等到她們剩餘的血汗，生命，給資本家榨取完了，那只有靜待死神的光臨。時時瀕於死亡線下的婦女勞動者，多麽的悲慘凄厲！</p>
<p>在現階叚的社會體制下婦女勞動階級，與其他階級，同樣都是與資本家底利害對立的。所以，婦女勞動者，要想由資本家手裏獲得自身的解放，必須要努力喚起革命的意識。等到這個意識普遍而深刻化的時候，那社會自然便會達到最後的一個形態，即社會主義的社會。在這個社會裏，絕不容有勞而不獲的人，同時也不容有不勞而獲的人，大家都是共同生產共同消費的社會成員底一分子。所以，目今的工廠法，工人條例，都不過是頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚的一種不澈底的辦法，離眞正保護婦女勞動的地域，還達差十萬八千里呢。</p>

Nine enemy aircraft carried out heavy bombing in the areas of Xifengkou, Cheheqiao, and Santunying this morning, injuring seven civilians and damaging several houses. Before dusk, about one company of cavalry and approximately one battalion of infantry were discovered in the left front of our Wang Zhibang's brigade position, attacking us, but they were quickly repelled.

<p>Luo Wengan Returned to Nanjing Yesterday Morning: Gave a Speech After Arriving in Nanjing; The Frontline Battles Are Progressing Well; Both Sides Are Reinforcing, and There Will Be Fierce Battles; A Japanese Attack on Beiping and Tianjin Is Quite Possible</p>
<p>Nanjing: Foreign Minister Luo arrived in Nanjing from Beiping on the morning of the 18th and immediately went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle important official business. Luo was suffering from a cold he caught on the way, and his voice was hoarse, but he was in high spirits. He expressed great indignation at the recent rumors circulating outside. According to what he told the Central News Agency reporter, since Chairman Chiang went north, the atmosphere of resistance against Japan in North China has been tense. The frontline battles have also been progressing well. Song Zheyuan's troops and others have repeatedly inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army, breaking their arrogance and boosting the morale of our army. Their contribution is not small. The Japanese army is currently awaiting reinforcements, and our army is also actively reinforcing. There will be fierce battles within days. According to Luo's observation, a Japanese invasion of Beiping and Tianjin is quite possible, but Yu Xuezhong, He Zhuguo, and other determined generals have already made up their minds. If the Japanese invade, they will be met with a head-on blow. Also, Luo had been away from Nanjing for a week, and cases were pending, so he had no time to go to Shanghai to welcome Wang. At the same time, Wang sent a telegram to Luo on the 18th, stating that he would come to Nanjing on the 19th, so Luo decided to cancel his trip to Shanghai. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: After Foreign Minister Luo returned to Nanjing, he told reporters that since the fall of Chengde, the situation in the north has become increasingly critical. The enemy's rumors and slanders have reached their limit. He took a special train north on the evening of the 10th, both to inspect the true situation and to promote the central government's consistent policies. In Beiping, he twice met with ministers and chargés d'affaires from various countries, declaring that the Japanese side's acts of aggression had been condemned by all countries in the world in the League of Nations report. Since this report has been unanimously approved by all countries and accepted by our country, at this time, we can only act in accordance with the intent of the report, and there is absolutely no possibility of compromise or direct negotiation. The central government's foreign policy has been consistent from beginning to end, and various rumors should not be believed. In Wuhan, he also called on Chairman Chiang, and their views were the same. In short, the matters of today should, on the one hand, urge all countries in the world to promptly fulfill their moral and legal responsibilities under the League of Nations charter and the League of Nations report, so as to restrain armed aggressors and maintain world peace. On the other hand, the whole country should unite as one and continue to resist by armed force to protect the national territory and restore lost land. At this point, there is still room for compromise and temporary peace. The press is the guide of national public opinion, and we especially hope that you can understand this purpose. For rumors also.

<p>The US Government's Attention Will Now Be Focused on Far East Diplomacy, and There Will Be Concrete Indications Soon; Recognition of Soviet Russia Is Not Far Away</p>
<p>Washington: Official circles' attention in the coming weeks will be focused on the Far East, in order to determine the new government's foreign policy. Although the United States is praising the technical points of British Prime Minister MacDonald's disarmament plan, it is also earnestly studying the political implications of its plan, such as the clause that signatory countries to the disarmament convention can convene a meeting when the non-war pact is violated. For example, the U.S. representative Davis will go to Geneva with the title of ambassador. Newspapers now report that he said that the United States has never been willing to underwrite the integrity of other countries and may not abandon the purely consultative policy invented by Stimson. The question of authorizing the president to declare an arms embargo on any part of the world will be discussed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday. At that time, Congress can have a concrete expression of emotions regarding the Far East. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: The new government has not yet agreed to announce its attitude toward Russia, but some parties expect that the United States will change its unfriendly attitude toward Russia. U.S. representative Davis may meet with Russian representative Litvinov in Geneva. Once the differences between the two sides are resolved, the United States will soon recognize Soviet Russia. American cotton planters, yarn factories, and machine manufacturers now all want to restore the Russian market. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Current Commentary</h3>
<p>How to Save the Nation? - Zhe</p>
<p>The loss of Rehe, according to most people's judgments, has many reasons. However, the most important of these is that Tang Yulin usually imposed extortionate taxes and levies, and his politics were corrupt and decadent, causing the people of Rehe to suffer long and painful years, willing to perish with him. Therefore, when the Japanese invaders came, no one was willing to resist, and they were happy to see Tang go. Only then could the Japanese invaders drive straight in, and the natural defenses were completely lost in less than ten days. No one can deny this kind of judgment. However, is this kind of phenomenon limited to the loss of Rehe? In the Incident of September 18th two years ago, the people of the three northeastern provinces were merely placed on the chopping block, waiting to be slaughtered, and they could not resist insult, and they could not defend their land. Is it not all the evil consequences of the accumulated corrupt politics of the past few decades? There is a saying that "things must first rot before insects grow." It is also said in the classics that "a country must first strike itself before others strike it." Therefore, under today's circumstances, foreign invaders are urgent, and domestic politics are also urgent. If the government does not have the determination to reform domestic politics, then it will certainly not have the power to resist foreign invaders. There is no other reason. The hearts of the people have already been alienated, and strength is freely concentrated, so there is no way to resist foreign invaders.</p>
<p>However, what we mean by reforming domestic politics is not to place undue emphasis on suppressing disturbances by force, hoping to restore national and social order. The reason for domestic unrest is due to the corruption of politics. Therefore, the way to pacify the country is to fundamentally reform corrupt politics, which cannot be achieved by strong pressure.</p>
<p>The politics of our country in the past twenty years can be summed up in one word: the continuation of warlord politics and bureaucratic politics. The warlords' division and occupation are still the same as before. The corruption and competition of officials are still the same as before. The instigation and sowing of discord by politicians is still the same as before. And their relentless pursuit of position and competition for profit, ignoring the national foundation and the lives of the people, are also the same as before. The political measures mostly run counter to the interests of the people. Officials are becoming richer every day, and the people are becoming poorer every day. The old and weak are tossed and turned, and the young and strong are displaced. In short, since the Republic of China, disasters have multiplied and disturbances have followed one after another. Corrupt politics and a disintegrating situation have already deeply planted the roots of foreign humiliation. Once something happens, it is difficult in practice to get these people, who are in deep water and fire, to fight for the country and die for the nation in order to resist the strong invaders. Moreover, at a time when the people are poor, their wealth is exhausted, and there is no time to save the dying, there is fundamentally no strength to resist violence. What we are saying here is not to blame one aspect or one group. The national situation has reached this point, how can we only make negative complaints? Moreover, the reason why this dark politics has been able to continue for the past twenty years is not only to blame the few people who are in charge of politics, but to say that all the people of our country should bear this responsibility. Today's national situation has reached a very dangerous and hopeless situation. If we want to break through the national crisis and break out of the encirclement, we must reform politics and start anew with the people, so that the hearts of the people can have something to rely on and the strength of the people can be concentrated. This is the most urgent problem and the most pressing task at present. We hope that people all over the country will think carefully and not neglect it.</p>

<p>Luo Wengan Returned to the Capital Yesterday Morning: Gave a Speech After Arriving in the Capital; The Frontline Battles Are Progressing Well; Both Sides Are Reinforcing, and There Will Be Fierce Battles; A Japanese Attack on Beiping and Tianjin Is Quite Possible</p>
<p>Nanjing: Foreign Minister Luo arrived in the capital from Beiping on the morning of the 18th and immediately went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle important official business. Luo was suffering from a cold he caught on the way, and his voice was hoarse, but he was in excellent spirits. He expressed great indignation at the recent rumors circulating outside. According to what he told the Central News Agency reporter, since Chairman Chiang went north, the atmosphere of resistance against Japan in North China has been tense. The frontline battles have also been progressing well. Song Zheyuan's troops and others have repeatedly inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army, breaking their arrogance and boosting the morale of our army. Their contribution is not small. The Japanese army is currently awaiting reinforcements, and our army is also actively reinforcing. There will be fierce battles within days. According to Luo's observation, a Japanese invasion of Beiping and Tianjin is quite possible, but Yu Xuezhong, He Zhuguo, and other determined generals have already made up their minds. If the Japanese invade, they will be met with a head-on blow. Also, Luo had been away from the capital for a week, and cases were pending, so he had no time to go to Shanghai to welcome Wang. At the same time, Wang sent a telegram to Luo on the 18th, stating that he would come to the capital on the 19th, so Luo decided to cancel his trip to Shanghai. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: After Foreign Minister Luo returned to the capital, he told reporters that since the fall of Chengde, the situation in the north has become increasingly critical. The enemy's rumors and slanders have reached their limit. He took a special train north on the evening of the 10th, both to inspect the true situation and to promote the central government's consistent policies. In Beiping, he twice met with ministers and chargés d'affaires from various countries, declaring that the Japanese side's acts of aggression had been condemned by all countries in the world in the League of Nations report. Since this report has been unanimously approved by all countries and accepted by our country, at this time, we can only act in accordance with the intent of the report, and there is absolutely no possibility of compromise or direct negotiation. The central government's foreign policy has been consistent from beginning to end, and various rumors should not be believed. In Wuhan, he also called on Chairman Chiang, and their views were the same. In short, the matters of today should, on the one hand, urge all countries in the world to promptly fulfill their moral and legal responsibilities under the League of Nations charter and the League of Nations report, so as to restrain armed aggressors and maintain world peace. On the other hand, the whole country should unite as one and continue to resist by armed force to protect the national territory and restore lost land. At this point, there is still room for compromise and temporary peace. The press is the guide of national public opinion, and we especially hope that you can understand this purpose. For rumors also.

<p>The US Government's Attention Will Now Be Focused on Far East Diplomacy, and There Will Be Concrete Indications Soon; Recognition of Soviet Russia Is Not Far Away</p>
<p>Washington: Official circles' attention in the coming weeks will be focused on the Far East, in order to determine the new government's foreign policy. Although the United States is praising the technical points of British Prime Minister MacDonald's disarmament plan, it is also earnestly studying the political implications of its plan, such as the clause that signatory countries to the disarmament convention can convene a meeting when the non-war pact is violated. For example, the U.S. representative Davis will go to Geneva with the title of ambassador. Newspapers now report that he said that the United States has never been willing to underwrite the integrity of other countries and may not abandon the purely consultative policy invented by Stimson. The question of authorizing the president to declare an arms embargo on any part of the world will be discussed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday. At that time, Congress can have a concrete expression of emotions regarding the Far East. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th</p>

<p>The British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Arrive in Rome, Met by Mussolini in Person; Important Issues Awaiting Discussion; The French Prime Minister Scheduled to Visit London Next Week for Reciprocal Visit; Japan Expresses Opposition to New Disarmament Proposals – Geneva – British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon departed from here at 8:45 this morning for Italy. According to news from Rome, Italian figures believe that in these troubled times of international affairs, the British authorities are willing to come to Rome to discuss plans for building Europe, which is very gratifying. They believe that this meeting is of great significance to both Europe and Italy. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Rome – Two squadrons of the Italian Naval Aviation escorted British Prime Minister MacDonald, his daughter Isabel, and Foreign Secretary Simon this morning. They departed from Genoa aboard Italian Air Minister Balbo's private seaplane, piloted by Balbo himself, and arrived at the Voti military naval base before noon. A large crowd welcomed them, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini also came to greet them in person. The group then traveled by car to the British Embassy in Rome. The two Prime Ministers are expected to meet this afternoon. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Rome – The Italian newspaper "Il Messaggero" in Rome expressed strong approval of the new disarmament plan proposed by the British Prime Minister at the disarmament talks. It stated that the British Prime Minister's plan is completely in line with the content of the memorandum previously proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Therefore, this meeting between the two Prime Ministers will definitely bring the two countries' views on disarmament into complete agreement. Because Mussolini will agree with any disarmament proposal that other countries are willing to endorse. Furthermore, in addition to the disarmament issue, this meeting between the leaders of Britain and Italy will also discuss the recovery of the world economy and the redistribution of economic resources. Mussolini hopes for tax reductions, the restoration of the gold standard, and the settlement of war debts. It is estimated that the talks between the British and Italian Prime Ministers will not conclude until next Monday. Afterwards, they may return directly to Paris to meet with French Prime Minister Daladier again. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Rome – Roman diplomatic circles now highly value the meeting between the British and Italian Prime Ministers, as the current European situation is extremely complex, unprecedented since 1918. It is reported that the issues to be discussed by both parties include: (1) Whether the disarmament conference can be preserved according to the British Prime Minister's recent proposal. (2) Regarding the situation arising from the German National Socialist Party's destruction of the Rhineland's neutral zone in the future, the British Prime Minister will ask the Italian Prime Minister to explain his attitude towards Germany's breach of contract. This is crucial because the rumors of an Italian-German alliance are widespread, and the relations between Italy and France have been cold for a long time, leading to the division of Europe into two major opposing blocs. (3) The dangerous situation in Poland, Yugoslavia, and Austria. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) – French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Pongue returned to Paris at 9:45 tonight and are scheduled to visit London next week for a reciprocal visit. According to the announcement here, the purpose is to discuss the results of MacDonald's talks with Mussolini in Italy. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) – The full text of the British Prime Minister's disarmament proposal arrived at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 18th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to hold a joint meeting with the military department starting next week to quickly determine Japan's attitude and send an urgent telegram to the delegation in Geneva. (Japan United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) – Regarding the new disarmament plan proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald on the 16th, the Army authorities will study the content after the report arrives. The opinions currently held on the various proposals are roughly as follows: The new proposal stipulates that the longest service period for active-duty soldiers is eight months. This is a proposal for European countries and has nothing to do with Japan. If the proposal is applied to countries outside Europe, Japan's service period is one and a half years. Therefore, it is very difficult to train soldiers in such a short period, and the required expenses are also considerable. Japan cannot agree. The proposal also stipulates that Germany's troop number is 200,000, which France will absolutely not recognize. Japan cannot agree either. Limiting the caliber of mobile land artillery to 150 mm can be agreed. However, the maximum limit for coastal defense artillery to 16 inches is also agreeable. The maximum weight of tanks being 16 tons is a case in favor of Britain. France advocates 60 tons, and Japan advocates 25 tons. Furthermore, limiting the maximum number of military aircraft for the six countries of France, Japan, Italy, Russia, the United States, and Britain to 500 is something Japan cannot agree to at all. It is quite difficult to distinguish between military and civilian aircraft, and the number of civilian aircraft in Britain and the United States is twenty times greater than in Japan, so equal regulations should not be imposed.

<p>Japan's Withdrawal from the League of Nations: The Privy Council's Detailed Investigation Committee Approves the Government's Original Proposal – Former Ambassador to Berlin Criticizes Uchida's Diplomacy; Deeply Concerned About Financial Exhaustion and Inability to Control the Eastern Provinces – (Tokyo) The Privy Council's Review Committee on the consultation case of withdrawing from the League of Nations held a meeting at the Privy Council office at 9:30 this morning. Chairman Kuratomi, Committee Chairman Hiranuma, various committee members, and Secretary-General Futakami attended. The failure of diplomatic negotiations was not attributed to their responsibility, and they trusted the government's future direction and encouraged its maintenance, stating that it was appropriate. After unanimous agreement, the original proposal was adopted, and the meeting adjourned at noon. The review report will be drafted by Secretary-General Futakami and submitted to the plenary session on the 25th or 27th. (Den-tsu Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Honda, the former Japanese ambassador to Berlin, published an article in a diplomatic magazine studying the impact of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. Although Honda also supports withdrawing from the League of Nations, he does not agree with the policies of Foreign Minister Count Uchida. When Uchida took office as Foreign Minister, he declared, "I will thoroughly reform Japan's foreign policy and completely eradicate past mistakes." Honda said that these words should not have come from the mouth of a diplomat. He also said that when the Chinese Revolution occurred, Uchida was the Foreign Minister. At that time, Honda's group of Japanese advocated implementing a certain plan to allow a certain member of the royal family to continue to claim the title of Emperor in Beijing, but Uchida did not approve of this plan. According to Honda's view, "The reason why Uchida wants to fundamentally eliminate the errors in Japanese diplomacy today is precisely because he failed to adopt our plan at that time." Honda concluded that the real danger faced by Japan in Manchuria is not in Geneva but in Japan's financial difficulties and the changes in the internal situation of Manchuria. Honda said that foreigners firmly believe that Japan will one day abandon Manchuria due to excessive financial difficulties. Foreigners also believe that the 30 million residents of Manchuria are all Chinese people and can never be permanently supervised by Japan. As a result, it will inevitably become an excessively costly and extremely difficult-to-control colony, which Japan will find difficult to maintain for long. Honda also said that "Manchukuo" is actually under the rule of Japan, and its important positions are all occupied by Japanese people. This is known to everyone, and Japan also admits it without denial. Honda's remarks are inconsistent with the declarations made by the Tokyo government and its representatives in Geneva on the issue of Manchurian independence. Under such circumstances, if the (Manchukuo) authorities feel that they have common interests with Japan, then the current situation can be barely maintained. Otherwise, chaos will be endless, and the Japanese army will be exhausted. Honda said that the Japanese military warlords are well aware of this, so they are taking necessary measures to deal with it. It is hoped that all the people of Manchuria will be united, which is truly an indispensable measure for Japanese policy. The Japanese army also seems to want to achieve this goal. However, can the Japanese army avoid conflicts of interest between Japan and Manchuria? The Japanese initially advocated the idea of "economic unity" towards Manchuria, but after a little thought, they realized that it was not feasible and temporarily abandoned it. Now they have changed to advocating the idea of "cooperation." The so-called "cooperation" is to develop the production of raw materials for Manchuria, while Japan retains the right to manufacture, and Japan monitors Manchuria to prevent it from establishing industries to compete with Japan, such as the cotton industry, which Japan wants to monopolize. However, Komai, the founder of (Manchukuo), believes that (Manchukuo) should be allowed to develop as much as possible and should not be obstructed, with the sole focus on the prosperity of Manchuria. These words cannot coexist with the plan of "cooperation." Now that Komai has been promoted, he only has a nominal title and no longer has the power to intervene in Manchurian affairs, but his opinions still represent the opinions of some Japanese people in Manchuria. These Japanese people should be called Manchurians rather than Japanese. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>With the Closing of Parliament Imminent, the Political Situation in Japan is Shifting; The Saito Cabinet's Tenure is Feared to be Short-Lived; The Seiyukai Party is Preparing to Take Over the Government</p>
<p>Tokyo – As Japan formally passes its withdrawal from the League of Nations, the 64th session of the Japanese Parliament also ends. Can the fate of the Saito Cabinet continue to be maintained? It has become a mystery in Japan's current political arena. According to general speculation, Prime Minister Saito is scheduled to visit Duke Saionji in Okitsu after the close of Parliament, with the main issue being the confirmation of the transfer of the current government. Although the government has consistently remained silent on the development of the political situation, the Seiyukai party, which holds the largest number of seats in Parliament, has been actively preparing to take over the government after the Saito Cabinet. The recent busy movements of key members of the Seiyukai party demonstrate that the Saito Cabinet is nearing its end. (Hua-Lien Telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>Mongolian Border Defense Council Telegraphs Request</p>
<h3>Guidance of League and Banner Officials and Civilians</h3>
<p>Nanjing – The Mongolian Border Defense National Salvation Council telegraphed Nanjing, stating that although the two Leagues and twenty Banners of Zhuo Zhao have been nominally occupied by Japan after the loss of Rehe, they have not actually established relations with Japan. The Central Government should approve the dispatch of liaison officers by the Council to the two Leagues and Banners of Zhuo Zhao to earnestly inform them of the Central Government's determination to resist Japan, and urge the Leagues and Banners to reorganize their troops and provide support nearby in order to increase the strength of the anti-Japanese forces. Furthermore, the violent Japanese are now establishing the Southern Xing'an Province in the Zhemeng, the Northern Xing'an Province in Hulun, and the Eastern Xing'an Province in Butha, and are also promoting the establishment of the Central Xing'an Province in Chifeng and plan to establish the Western Xing'an Province in Chahar in the future, and there are rumors of luring Mongolians to build a Mongolian country. In this dire situation, it is inevitable that those who are threatened and enticed will be tempted.

<h3>The Incident of the Arrest of British Technicians</h3>
<p>British-Russian Relations Tense Litvinov Insists Foreigners Must Be Subject to Soviet Law The British Ambassador Protests, Saying the Rupture of British-Russian Relations Is Worrying</p>
<p>Reuters Moscow, 17th Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov notified the British Ambassador in Moscow today that the arrested employees of the Vega Electric Company will be tried in the Supreme Court for counter-revolutionary crimes, the punishment for which is the death penalty. Litvinov rejected the idea that British citizens residing in the Soviet Union are not subject to Soviet law. Litvinov expressed hope that the case would not affect British-Russian relations, as relations are more important than any store or individual. The British Ambassador to Russia protested, saying that the charge of sabotage is not credible and demanded that the case be dropped; otherwise, it would affect the British-Russian trade agreement, which expires on April 17th, and British-Russian relations may be ruptured.</p>
<p>TASS Moscow, 17th The Soviet government has refused the British government's interference in the arrest of six British employees of the Vickers Company. The course of the negotiation is as follows: On March 15th, Baldwin reported to the British House of Commons that the British government had instructed the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Ovey, to submit a (severe question) to the Soviet government and stated that such arrests would (cause unfortunate results in British-Soviet relations). According to news here today, Ovey has submitted the British government's question to Litvinov, and Litvinov has replied. Litvinov's reply stated that the British Ambassador's request in this case actually asserts that all British citizens should not be subject to Soviet law, allowing them to commit crimes and avoid trial. In this situation, if a British citizen is accused of a crime and there is evidence or a confirmed confession, the trial can be stopped because their government says they are innocent. This proposal is obviously unacceptable to the government of any independent country, because if a crime has been committed and evidence exists, the responsible authorities must examine the evidence based on the law and the principles of national security to determine the actual guilt or innocence, or to understand the motive for the crime and try to prevent it. This is a necessary procedure in all countries, not just the Soviet Union. For example, recently, there have been cases of arresting and trying foreigners in important fixed positions abroad and accusing representatives of foreign banks. However, these situations are unavoidable and should not affect international relations, which are of greater significance than the interests of individuals and companies. In the Soviet Union, there are thousands of German, American, and other foreign citizens, and they have never been detained or charged. Since the establishment of British-Soviet relations, hundreds of British citizens have come to the Soviet Union, and they have traveled freely without being detained. Even the representatives of the Vickers Company have been in the Soviet Union for nearly ten years, and nothing has happened. Therefore, the recent arrests are due to the importance of the crimes, and it is necessary to protect the security of the country and its property. It would be a great mistake if such an accidental event could affect the mutually beneficial political and commercial relations between the Soviet Union and Britain. Therefore, the Soviet government will not relax the legal trial of the British employees because of any oppression or threat. If the British government and its embassy are sure that the accused in this case are innocent, they can also not be alarmed. The British Ambassador's request was told by Litvinov that the six British employees violated Article 58 of the Soviet Criminal Law, and the examination by the National Political Bureau is about to be completed. The case will soon be transferred to the Supreme Court for trial.</p>
<p>Russian Ambassador to Germany</p>
<h3>Returns to Moscow Overnight</h3>
<p>The Purpose of Returning Home is Not Announced Only Denies Being Officially Recalled</p>
<p>National News Agency Berlin, 17th The Soviet Ambassador to Germany, Krestinsky, suddenly departed for Moscow tonight, causing national speculation about the future of German-Russian relations. Regarding the purpose of this trip, the Russian Ambassador refused to fully disclose it, only saying that he was returning home to discuss the recent ten days of German developments with the government, and denied the claim of being officially recalled. As for the time of the Russian Ambassador's return, people in the embassy could not predict it, only saying that it is expected that he will not return to his post for at least ten days. According to the general opinion here, everyone feels that German Chancellor Hitler's activities are not very friendly to Russian citizens, so the relationship between the two countries has become slightly tense.</p>

<p>Mediation of the Colombia-Peru Dispute</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Completes Report</h3>
<p>Unanimously Approved by the Executive Council The Peruvian Representative Angrily Withdraws from the Meeting</p>
<p>Havas Geneva, 18th The League of Nations Executive Council unanimously approved the report and recommendations submitted by the Three-Person Committee organized for the dispute between Peru and Colombia. Colombia has recently accepted it, while the Peruvian representative still maintains an opposing attitude. After the report and recommendations were passed, he suddenly left the meeting without bidding farewell to the Executive Council.</p>
<p>Reuters Geneva, 17th Today, the League of Nations Executive Council drafted a report on the dispute between Colombia and Peru, following the precedent of the Sino-Japanese dispute. The report includes historical facts, conclusions, and recommendations. The evidence cited in this report is unfavorable to Peru and recommends that both sides immediately withdraw their troops from the disputed area and begin negotiations. For several months, Peru and Colombia have been fighting an undeclared war over a small town called Leticia on the Amazon River.</p>
<p>Havas Geneva, 18th After the Peruvian representative left the Executive Council, the French representative, Massigli, on behalf of the French government, supported the League of Nations to follow the conciliation procedure stipulated in Article 15, paragraph 3 of the Covenant, saying that the League of Nations' conciliation of the Colombia-Peru dispute in this way can be said to have fulfilled its duties. It also stated that this conciliation respects the Covenant and current treaties, as well as the sovereignty of Colombia, and that the responsibility for the instructions given by irresponsible thugs has also been pointed out, which can be regarded as fair. Massigli praised Colombia's reliance on the League of Nations and advocated starting consultations to resolve the issue. The Executive Council decided to organize an advisory committee to monitor the dispute between Colombia and Peru, just like the advisory committee monitoring the dispute between China and Japan.</p>
<h3>Reforming the Indian Constitution</h3>
<p>The British Government Publishes a White Paper Proposing the Establishment of an Autonomous Indian Federation The Governor-General Holds Vast Executive Power</p>
<p>Reuters London, 18th The British government published a white paper today on the reform of the Indian constitution, which contains proposals for the establishment of an Indian Federal Constitution. The Federation includes autonomous British Indian provinces and Indian states that choose to join the Federation. This white paper was compiled based on the resolutions passed at three round-table conferences held in London in recent years. The proposals will be reviewed by a committee jointly selected by both houses of Parliament and representatives of Indian public opinion. Then, based on the committee's report, final proposals will be made and formed into a bill.</p>
<p>The proposal states that the Central Federation and the provinces will form executive councils, which will be responsible to the elected legislative assemblies.</p>
<p>The Governor-General has special responsibilities regarding peace, public safety, financial stability and credit, minorities, protecting civil servants, preventing commercial discrimination, and protecting the rights of any state in India. The Governor-General may act at will on these matters as he deems appropriate.</p>
<p>The Federal Legislature has a Senate and a House of Representatives. The Senate, or Upper House, has a term of seven years, except in cases of dissolution. The number of senators shall not exceed 260, of which 150 are elected by members of the provincial assemblies of British India, and no more than 100 are appointed by Indian rulers, and no more than 10 are appointed by the Governor-General. The House of Representatives has a term of five years and has 375 members, of which 250 represent constituencies in British India, and no more than 125 are appointed by Indian rulers. All bills must be passed by both houses to become law, except for reserved bills. Any law approved by the Governor-General may be rejected by the Emperor within twelve months.</p>
<p>If the Upper and Lower Houses disagree, the Governor-General has the power to convene a joint session of both houses. The Governor-General may introduce bills in any house to exercise a special responsibility. If such a bill is not passed within the specified time, the Governor-General has the power to promulgate it and make it a Governor-General's law. The Governor-General's special responsibilities can also be granted by legally binding laws. If the constitution is violated, the Governor-General may issue a proclamation and exercise all powers granted to any federal official himself.</p>
<p>The White Paper also stipulates that before the establishment of the Federation, there should be an independent Reserve Bank free from political forces, which has been well-managed. Various issues, including law and order, will be transferred to the provinces and managed by democratically elected administrators. Provincial governors and the Governor-General have special responsibilities and powers. The provincial assemblies will be expanded, and about 27 percent of the total population will have the right to vote. Women will also be able to attend and vote in all assemblies.</p>
<p>This proposal confirms the existing rights of public office. The Secretary of State for India will continue to appoint officials for the Indian Civil Service, the police, and religious affairs. However, regarding future recruitment, it is stipulated that a survey should be conducted every five years. The secretariat of the Indian Senate will be exempted from paying, and will be replaced by six advisors. Burma is not included in this proposal, as it has not yet been decided whether Burma wants to separate from India.</p>
<h3>Another Record of the Unprecedented Bloody Battle of Xifengkou</h3>
<p>Conversations with Zhang Shusheng and Sha Yang on Their Return Investigation into the Killing of Enemy Officers Two-Thirds of the Enemy at Xifengkou Resolved</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence After the 29th Army of Song Zheyuan reached the front line of Xifengkou on the 9th of this month, it immediately launched an attack. The left and right wings of the enemy army were surrounded at that time. After five days and nights of fierce fighting, the right wing enemy army at the 29-li Fort north of the pass was completely resolved. The left wing enemy army was a cavalry company and two infantry companies, carrying eighteen cannons, and is still surrounded by our army. It has been two days without food and drink and can be resolved in a day or two. As a result of this five-day battle, the enemy suffered more than 7,000 casualties. According to a Japanese document obtained by our army, a total of 53 officers from colonel down to major and more than 30 company commanders or higher died. Currently, another part of our army, totaling three regiments, has bypassed the enemy's rear and is encamped more than 70 li outside Xifengkou, creating a large encirclement of the enemy. In addition to the Hattori and Suzuki brigades, there are still more than 10,000 rebellious troops on the front line, who have been engaged in fierce fighting with Song Zheyuan's army for days. Those who have been killed, wounded, or dispersed have been resolved by two-thirds, and a small part of the enemy army will soon be resolved. Zhang Shusheng, the former division commander of the Northwest Army, recently represented General Zhu Qinglan in going to Xifengkou to comfort Song's troops. He returned from the front line of Xifengkou late on the 14th and arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 15th to report the process to Zhu. According to Zhang, the bloody battle on the front is very detailed, and it is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Our Army Takes Wife Mountain in Hand-to-Hand Combat</h3>
<p>Xifengkou was originally the defense area of Wan Fulin's troops. After consultation with Army Commander Song Zheyuan, it was agreed to rotate the defense on the 10th. On the 8th and 9th, Wan requested Song's troops to set out early and defend the area due to the urgent situation on the front. Song arrived at Zunhua on the 9th and immediately ordered Wang Changhai's regiment to march urgently. At that time, the first line of the enemy army had already deployed at Wife Mountain inside Xifengkou. When Wang's regiment arrived, the enemy was on the mountain, and we were at the foot of the mountain. Our army fought bravely, climbed the mountain, and seized the enemy's mountain positions, completely in hand-to-hand combat. The next morning (the 10th), our army completely recovered the enemy positions on Wife Mountain. This battle was personally commanded by Brigade Commander Zhao Dengyu at the front. Zhao was wounded by a bullet that day, but he persisted bravely. He treated the wound himself and continued to supervise the troops at the front. On the night of the 10th, Army Commander Song again sent infantry to Dongjiakou and Panjiakou and attacked the enemy's artillery positions, killing all seven or eight hundred of the enemy's artillerymen. The enemy's artillery commander also died in the attack. At that time, the enemy army in the Xifengkou Wife Mountain area moved the main force and high command to the highest peak of the Great Wall north of Wife Mountain, which was the turret. Our army ordered to seize the enemy's turret positions again. After dozens of hand-to-hand charges, our army suffered the loss of a battalion commander, Su Zongyuan, and two wounded battalion commanders, and soldiers died or were wounded from three companies. The enemy's casualties were more than double those of our army.</p>
<h3>Killing Two Enemy Soldiers is Really Not Worth It</h3>
<p>The enemy is currently surrounded for two days. The most intense battles are at Shangxinzhuang and Baizhuangzi, to the left and right of the turret. On the 10th, more than 2,000 enemy troops rushed from Dongjiakou to aid the enemy troops on this line. They were met head-on and beaten back by Li Jiusi's brigade of Feng Zhi'an's division of Song's army. When I left Xifengkou late on the 14th, the enemy troops were still surrounded on the mountain. According to the results of our army's search of the enemy's corpses, there were two White Russians and a small number of rebellious troops, but most of them were Japanese soldiers, totaling more than 10,000 people. An investigation found that 53 officers from colonel down and 30 company commanders or higher were killed. To this day, enemy corpses are everywhere in Xifengkou, no one is buried, and the bloody smell is offensive and makes one want to vomit. When the 29th Army set out from the rear, Commander Song personally wrote the eight characters "Advance Without Retreat, Die Only" and ordered the officers and soldiers to read them carefully and never forget them. Therefore, this time, Song's troops charged into the enemy, only knowing to go forward. Santunying was the place where the Ming general Qi Jiguang trained his troops. North of Santunying is Ziji Pavilion, where Qi Jiguang used to store military equipment. There is also a stone tablet under the pavilion, recording General Qi's capture and killing of Japanese pirates. When I left Santunying yesterday, I heard that a part of the enemy's main force is currently moving from Pingquan towards Kuancheng, preparing to counterattack. Our army's morale is greatly boosted, and we are determined to fight to the death. Merchants and residents in the Xifengkou area are conducting business as usual. I personally asked the people, and the merchants and residents replied, "With the National Army here, we are not afraid of the Japanese." This shows how deeply the merchants and residents recognize Song's troops. I met wounded soldiers on the front. They said, "This time, I really didn't get enough for my money. When I wielded my sword on the front, I had just killed two enemy soldiers when another enemy soldier stabbed my buttocks with a bayonet. I wanted to kill the enemy with a sword again, but I had no strength. If my injury had been delayed by half an hour, I could have killed more than ten enemy soldiers." When the battle had just begun, Army Commander Song Zheyuan had ordered that anyone who captured an enemy soldier alive would be rewarded with $100. However, the soldiers all said that $100 in hand is not as satisfying as a single sword strike. Therefore, after five days of fierce fighting, when the soldiers encountered the enemy, they cut them down and did not capture a single one alive.</p>
<h3>A Conversation with a Wounded Battalion Commander</h3>
<p>On the 14th, at 8 AM, I met Wang Ziliang, the wounded battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion, Wang Changhai Regiment, Zhao Dengyu Brigade, Feng Zhian Division of the Song Zheyuan Army, in Zunhua. Wang was wounded in his right hand, his military cap was pierced by a bullet, and his cotton overcoat and pants were pierced in more than a dozen places. I immediately inquired about his combat experience. According to Wang, the battalion had 520 officers and soldiers when they set out. The fighting lasted for five days and nights, with the daytime battles and nighttime raids on the 12th being the fiercest. We killed enemies with broadswords and bombs, leaving corpses all over the mountains. The number of enemy deaths was many times greater than our own. The battalion's adjutant, Guo Jiafang, was also wounded in his right foot by an enemy stone while bravely resisting the enemy. Of the battalion's four companies, the 9th Company Commander Liu Shichang was wounded at 3 PM on the 9th while attacking the high mountain on the right side of Xifengkou. Platoon Leader Hou Fengming and Quartermaster Xue Yaokun were both killed in action. Platoon Leader Zhao Kexiu had his right arm broken. Fifty-seven soldiers were wounded or killed. The 10th Company Commander Zhang Weijin, in a night raid on the enemy at Caiziyu, captured four cannons and thirty-six shells and borrowed the enemy's cannons to attack them. However, the enemy counterattacked with concentrated troops and machine guns. The company commander was wounded in the waist and legs. More than eighty soldiers were wounded or killed. Platoon Leader Meng Tiechou was killed in action, and the other officers were also wounded. The 11th Company attacked Laoposhan, on the left rear side of Xifengkou, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Company Commander Hu Guangxing was wounded in his left hand. While capturing a blockhouse, he was stabbed by an enemy knife in his right hand, with four wounds to his right arm. Platoon Leader Cao Xiaozhi was killed in action, and all the other officers were wounded. More than ninety soldiers were wounded or killed. The 12th Company launched a night attack on Dianyu by detouring around the enemy. Company Commander Wang Tingli was killed in action while capturing the enemy's machine gun positions. Platoon Leaders Zhang Xingtang and Zhang Guisheng were both wounded. Sixty-four soldiers were wounded or killed. In total, the entire battalion suffered twelve wounded officers, three hundred and forty-one wounded soldiers, five officers killed in action, and thirty-seven soldiers killed in action, for a total of three hundred and seventy-eight officers and soldiers wounded or killed. The remaining one hundred and forty-two officers and soldiers have been transferred to the rear for rest. The battalion commander also said that they still maintain the spirit of "only advancing, never retreating, dying rather than surrender," and that they would rush to the front lines to continue killing the enemy as soon as they recovered from their injuries.

<h3>A Record of Sun Dianying's Army Resisting the Enemy in the Border Fortress</h3>
<p>The 41st Army's Secretary-General Returns to Peiping from the Frontlines - Bitterly Discusses the Hardships of the Battles around Chifeng</p>
<p>Peiping dispatch: Zhang Luxian, the secretary-general of the 41st Army Commander Sun Dianying, followed Sun to Rehe to resist the enemy. On the evening of March 3rd, the enemy forces approached Chifeng and surrounded the city. Although Sun's army fought bravely, they were forced to withdraw from the city walls due to the fierce pressure from the main enemy forces. Zhang also withdrew that night, sustaining a bullet wound to his leg. He then detoured through Duolun and arrived in Peiping on the 13th via Zhangjiakou. At 1 PM on the 14th, he met with the Peiping press at the 41st Army's office to report on Sun's bitter fighting in Rehe. The details of his account are recorded below:</p>
<p>My army commander, Sun, met with the Acting Chairman Zhang before the troops set out, asking whether to depart immediately. Zhang said to wait in Changping. Sun then met with General Zhu (Qinglan), who said that with a large enemy force pressing in, they should depart quickly. Upon hearing this, Sun again met with Zhang to inquire, and Zhang then ordered our army to depart. Sun then obeyed the order and began moving our army from Changping on the 9th, concentrating in Weichang. They endured great hardships along the way. After arriving in Chengde, he met with Tang Yulin, who expressed approval and said that the defenses around Chifeng had been built and supplies were sufficient, with fighting expected in about a month. On February 18th, Sun met with President Song (Ziwen), Acting Chairman Zhang (Xueliang), and General Zhu (Qinglan) in Chengde, and then ordered our army to advance rapidly. Sun himself also left Chengde on the 23rd and arrived in Weichang on the 26th. He then received a telegram from Tang Yulin saying that the telephone line to Kailu was down and the Cui Brigade had also retreated. After receiving the telegram, Sun telegraphed Tang again, asking where Cui had retreated to, but Tang did not reply. Several days later, Tang sent another telegram, asking to pay attention to the Cui Brigade. On the 28th, Sun personally led myself and over ten staff members forward. At that time, the Ding Brigade's Zheng Regiment had arrived at Jianchangyingzi. Our army's defense line stretched over a hundred li. Sun, based on Tang's assertion that Chifeng's fortifications had been completed, went to inspect them himself, only to find that the trenches had been flattened by the wind. Sun arrived in Chifeng on the morning of the 28th. At that time, the Wang Regiment had also arrived at Laming'an to construct fortifications, and the Li Regiment had also arrived at Sashuipo to build fortifications. Sun again telegraphed Tang, asking for the location of the allied forces, but Tang did not reply. At dawn on the 1st of this month, two members of the support association returned from Daxingdala, saying that the Cui Brigade was unstable and Feng Zhanhai's troops had also retreated, and would arrive in five or six days. At this time, enemy cavalry had already been spotted on the front lines. Our Li Regiment encountered enemy cavalry on the way to Sashuipo. Upon seeing our army arrive, the enemy had already deployed positions at the foot of the mountain, over twenty li from Chifeng. At 11 AM on the 1st, the first contact was made. By 2 PM, the enemy was pressing to the base of the Chifeng city walls. Army Commander Sun personally led the Li Battalion to resist, and the enemy began to retreat to their original positions. Due to the late hour, the size of the enemy force could not be determined. There was no action overnight. At this time, our artillery was in Longhua, and the majority of the troops were in the old Weichang, over six hundred li from Chifeng. Sun immediately issued an emergency order to mobilize troops to reinforce the front. At the same time, he ordered our troops in Daming'an to outflank the enemy's rear, but there was no response. It was then learned that that unit had also made contact with the enemy. At dawn on the 2nd, Sun personally led the Li Battalion forward, while awaiting reinforcements. At that time, the main enemy forces arrived. The Li Battalion then retreated to the bottom of the Chifeng city walls. Sun personally pointed a pistol at the Li Battalion Commander on the city walls, forbidding him from retreating, or he would be shot. Li then knelt on the ground and reported to the army commander that they had retreated due to running out of ammunition and supplies. Sun then ordered the Li Battalion to advance again. At this time, over two thousand of the enemy's Motegi cavalry from Weichang pursued the Li Battalion along the north and south sides of the city. As the engagement was taking place, Feng Zhanhai's troops also charged straight in, retreating into the city. Sun then ordered Feng's troops to retreat to Wudan, and Tang Yulin's troops to retreat to Heishui, in order to avoid disrupting the defensive lines. Feng, at this time, discussed the situation with Sun in the city, and left the city at 1:00 AM. There were six streets in Chifeng. The enemy built defenses in the streets with two thousand sandbags. At 3 PM on the 2nd, the enemy force that had been pursuing the Li Battalion suddenly withdrew, and the enemy's tanks and armored vehicles were all over the city. At the same time, they launched an attack. First, an enemy aircraft arrived for reconnaissance, then another. In the west of Chifeng, one aircraft flew back, while the other circled in the air. Soon, six enemy aircraft arrived in formation and dropped fifty or sixty heavy bombs in the area. It was later learned that a battalion of our reinforcements had been bombed at Guduhe. Ammunition and grenades in Chifeng were also exhausted. By the evening, the east gate of Chifeng was breached by enemy tanks. Sun immediately gathered his subordinates, numbering only three companies, and withdrew through the west gate. The enemy troops followed and entered through the east gate. Sun led his troops to the Zizhe River area. At that time, the support troops also arrived, and they were ordered to defend the city for another night. By the morning of the 3rd, the 2nd Battalion of the Liu Brigade's Tong Regiment in Xiniu Boluo Guduhe was also engaged in fierce fighting. On the evening of the 2nd, while fighting, they finally received a telegram from Tang Yulin saying that he had deployed defenses in Heishui Jianping. Feng Zhanhai's troops were also gathering in Wudan. The next day, some of Tang's troops in Heishui defected, some retreated, and some had not yet arrived. Feng's troops in Wudan also disappeared. Our army had become an isolated force. On the night of the 3rd, they withdrew from Guduhe. On the 3rd, fortifications had been built at Houtougou in the old Weichang. Contact was reestablished on the 4th. For the past four days, they have been fighting fiercely in the Houtougou area. As a result of the continuous fierce fighting, our army captured one enemy tank and four armored vehicles, and eliminated over four hundred enemy soldiers. Sun sustained a minor arm wound. At this time, he began to gather his troops from Houtougou at the old Weichang. On the 7th, Army Commander Sun went to Zhuizishan. On the 8th, he withdrew from the old Weichang to the three areas of Beitingzi, Yinfugou, and Guangyicheng to deploy defenses. Sun then telegraphed Zhang for instructions. Zhang replied in a telegram, saying that he deeply admired their hard fighting in Rehe and should establish contact with the rear to ensure safety. Later, another telegram arrived saying that Zhao Chengshou's Yi troops had arrived in Chahar and should be contacted. My leg was injured during the withdrawal from Chifeng. I left Zhuizishan on the 9th and arrived in Duolun on the 10th. On the way back to Peiping, I saw that the Zhao and Chuan forces were still over sixty li from Duolun. The Zhao and Chuan forces would need about a week before they could move to the front lines. Our defensive positions, which previously faced east, have now been changed to face southeast, moving towards Fengning on one side and defending against enemy attacks from Longhua on the other. Since the start of the Rehe campaign, our army has suffered over a thousand casualties. Two regimental and battalion commanders have been wounded. Over twenty company and platoon commanders have been killed in action. Battalion Commander Zhang died with over ten bullets in his body while capturing a tank, which was also a tragic event. Rehe is a barren and impoverished land. There are no food supplies, and they must be distributed every half month. If Chifeng had not been lost, they could have been sustained, but after the loss of Chifeng, even millet rice could not be obtained. Currently, our army's food consists of millet cooked and eaten whenever hungry. In addition, due to the thin clothing, the soldiers are freezing to death every day, with some even losing their legs to frostbite. Medical supplies are also extremely scarce, and the suffering is unspeakable. Furthermore, throughout this campaign, no orders were received from any quarter. There was no contact between the front and the rear, and rear support was out of the question. There was also absolutely no preparation for the initial fighting, and even trenches were not constructed, which led to the current retreat. (15th)</p>
<h3>The Situation in Tianjin is Severe</h3>
<p>The Decadent Atmosphere Has Been Revived After Chiang Kai-shek's Trip North - The Chairman of Hebei Province Goes to Baoding to Seek Instructions</p>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: The fall of Rehe has shocked North China. Enemy forces are closing in on Tianjin and Peiping. However, in the continuous fierce fighting at Jiagufengkou, our Song Zheyuan's troops bravely resisted. With excessive casualties, the enemy seems to be planning to withdraw to a suitable location to await reinforcements and then launch an offensive. On the Gubeikou front, our [censored] troops, after building new defensive positions the day before yesterday, have now had a large number of fresh troops arrive to take over, so morale is very high. In northern Rehe, Sun Dianying's troops, after being surrounded by the enemy in Chifeng and cut off from support, have also retreated to a suitable location to reorganize and counterattack. Upon investigation, the speed of the loss of territory in this Rehe campaign was definitely due to Zhang Xueliang's lack of organization and deployment beforehand, as well as the hesitant and unenterprising attitude of commander Zhang Zuoxiang, and the lack of coordination between the various divisions entering Rehe. The resistance of Song's troops at Xifengkou is proof of this.</p>
<p>After Chairman Chiang's trip north, the spirit of the party, army, and government has become less scattered than before. During the Zhang Xueliang era, a luxurious and leisurely atmosphere had been created in the capital, which remained unchanged even with the extremely severe external situation. Recently, there have been signs of reform and reorganization.</p>
<p>Tianjin is an important rear base for military affairs. Last month, when the Rehe campaign had just begun, the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin had plans to cause disturbances, intending to cut off our rear support. However, due to too many international considerations, they had to wait for an opportunity to act. Unexpectedly, Chengde fell after several days of fighting, and the situation temporarily eased. Now that our army is actively reinforcing the Great Wall area, the Japanese army is again actively planning disturbances in Tianjin and Peiping. Iron fences or brick walls have been built at all points where the Japanese concession in Tianjin borders the Chinese area for defense. Sentries are posted at night within the concession to watch pedestrians and conduct thorough searches. As a result, business in the Japanese concession has become increasingly sluggish. The Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Kuwashima Kazue, lodged a protest with the Hebei Provincial Government at the end of last month, using the Boxer Protocol as a pretext to prohibit the stationing of troops within twenty li of Tianjin and requesting the withdrawal of our troops from Muzhuangzi in the Tianjin suburbs. The provincial government has replied with a reasoned letter. Recently, the Japanese Consul has lodged a second protest with the provincial government, using strong language and stating that if the Chinese side does not withdraw the troops stationed in the Tianjin suburbs, the Chinese side will be responsible for any incidents that occur. The intention to provoke and shift blame is clearly exposed. Therefore, the situation has recently shifted from calm to tense. Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong, due to the importance of military and diplomatic issues, reported the situation to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Minister He Yingqin, and Minister Luo Wenqian at any time. He also went to Beiping and Baoding the day before yesterday with He Jingwu, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's representative, to meet with Chiang, He, Luo and other authorities to seek instructions on everything. Yu has now returned to Tianjin, maintaining a calm attitude and clearly ordering all police and constables to pay attention to local security and take appropriate precautions. Therefore, although rumors are rampant, order in the city remains calm as usual. (March 16th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Finance Minister Song Visits Songjiang</p>
<p>Acting Executive Yuan Finance Minister Song Ziwen, at around 3 PM today (the 18th), arrived at Weiqiao on the Songwei Road in his private car. Due to the unfinished bridge construction, he was unable to proceed. He telegraphed Songjiang Station to send a car to meet him. He arrived in Songjiang at 4 PM, got out of the car at Songfu Xiaozhu, and walked to Changzhen to visit Dawei. He was accompanied by two female relatives, the president of Jin Cheng Bank, and four guards, who provided security at all times. He then got into the car at Fuqinghui and drove back to Weiqiao before returning to Shanghai. However, the wealthy merchants were not notified, so few people were aware of his visit.</p>
<h3>A Worker, Slandered, Angrily Attempts Suicide</h3>
<p>A foreman named Jin at the city's telephone bureau recently had his clothes stolen and investigated everywhere without results. Unexpectedly, some people suspected that the theft was committed by two workers at the bureau named Ying A'er. The rumor spread to Wu Er, who was known to be very honest and upright. Hearing the suspicion, he was filled with anger and secretly ingested opium before rushing home to quarrel with his family. Shortly after, the poison took effect. After people learned the circumstances of his poisoning, they immediately called for a doctor to treat him. However, it is said that he ingested too much, and his life is still in danger. Who stole the foreman's clothes remains a mystery.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>A Country Woman Who Resisted Robbers Was Brutally Killed</p>
<p>At Dongyanshang in Wangting Township, where Suzhou and Wuxi meet, nine bandits broke into the home of villager Lu Alai on the morning of the 17th, ransacking the house and stealing silver dollars and clothing worth about 130 yuan. Lu Alai's wife bravely resisted the robbers and was beaten to death with wooden sticks. The robbers then fled in a roar. The local security chief has reported the case to the district prosecutor's office, which has dispatched personnel to investigate.</p>
<h3>Suspicious Men and Women Detained and Sent to the District Office</h3>
<p>Along the railway in Huqiu yesterday morning (the 18th), two men and women appeared suspicious. They were spotted by Ji Fubao, the leader of the Sixth Jia of the Sixth District security team, who searched them and found two box cannons. Subsequently, three more male accomplices were apprehended and all were sent to the district office for interrogation.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Trial Judges Transferred in the High Court</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 18th), the High Court announced that Shen Nianzu, the judge of Liuhe County, was transferred to the province. Weng Jiali was appointed to fill the vacancy. Ma Boliang, the trial judge of Suqian, was dismissed and replaced by Shen Yingling. Zhuang Yingshao, the trial judge of Funing, resigned and was replaced by Yang Benwei. Dai Leshan, the trial judge of Funing, and Lei Yinghuan, the trial judge of Jiancheng, were transferred to each other's positions.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Prohibition of Manufacturing and Selling Old Weights and Measures - During the Promotion of the Implementation of the Weights and Measures Geng System, inspectors Tang Fuquan and Qin Hemen have been earnestly guiding and inspecting various industries. To date, most industries have successively switched to new products. However, the county government has repeatedly received confidential reports that various manufacturing shops have recently been privately manufacturing Jiang devices. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Chen believed that these shops were not only hindering the promotion of the new system but also violating the law, which was highly inappropriate. In addition to dispatching personnel to secretly investigate at any time, yesterday he specially notified all weights and measures manufacturing factories to take note. The prices of new instruments sold by the same industry and various shops are also not allowed to be raised to make profits or sold at low prices to cause disputes. In addition, the National Bureau of Weights and Measures, because the weights produced in the provinces are mostly inconsistent with the regulations, and each uses old-style weights to manufacture new-style scales, and there are no representative numbers of each county, should be immediately investigated and prohibited. A special letter has been sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction to instruct various counties to thoroughly investigate and strictly ban them. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Chen of this county immediately complied with it.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<h3>A Robbery Occurred in Xinzha Town</h3>
<p>Xinzha Town, west of Wuyi County, is only ten li from the city. The stores and residents are still quite prosperous. Since the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway set up a station in the town, the transportation has become even more convenient. Unexpectedly, at about 6 PM on the 17th, many bandits, under the pretext of borrowing something to buy from the Wuyishun South Goods Store in the town, began to quarrel with the wife of the shop owner, Wu Chuanchun, and violently slapped her. Wu Chuanchun stepped forward to resist. The bandits then pulled out three pistols. Wu knew things were not good and escaped with his son Peiliang. Another bandit then stepped forward and slashed Wu Chuanchun several times with a knife. The remaining bandits then broke into the store and ransacked it. At this time, the town's shops were just closing for the night. Upon hearing the alarm, they immediately reported it and had the nearby police team go to apprehend them, and they also telephoned the Public Security Bureau in the city, which immediately dispatched inspector Xu Shengtong to lead more than a dozen policemen to take a car outside the West Gate and rush to apprehend them. The Public Security Bureau of Benniu Town also sent policemen to rush to the scene, but the bandits knew things were not good after the robbery and had fled in all directions by the time the armed team arrived. As for the injured Wu Chuanchun, they are trying to find a way to treat him.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<h3>Provincial and County Police Teams Jointly Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>In the area where Nantong, Rugao, Jingjiang, Qing, and Taixing counties meet, there is a gang of bandits led by "Blind Lu," who have been gathering to cause disturbances and great harm. On the 17th, the police teams from Nantong, Rugao, Jingjiang, and Taixing counties joined forces with the provincial security corps to suppress them.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<h3>Standards for Evaluating County Security</h3>
<p>The Provincial Security Committees and Security Corps in various counties of Jiangsu Province have been established in order. The Jiangsu Provincial Security Committee, in order to evaluate the performance of various counties, has held the first spring assessment. The assessment methods, district locations, and the list of commissioners have all been determined. It is reported that the scoring standards for this assessment are divided into two types: group assessment and individual assessment. Group assessment includes (1) whether the number of people trained in each county meets the prescribed number, (2) the degree of training, (3) whether national defense training is legal, and (4) the level of civic knowledge. Individual assessment includes (1) marksmanship, with each person limited to one shot at a distance of 200 meters, (2) physical strength to lift a certain weight, and (3) fitness walking. A score of 60 is considered passing, and 100 is a perfect score. Those who perform well in the group assessment will be awarded a championship flag, and those who perform well in the individual assessment will be awarded a silver shield medal. Those who fail will be urged to step up training in the respective counties. As for the departure date, due to committee affairs, it will be determined after Commissioner Leng Yuqiu first goes to Nantong for assessment and returns to the province, and then the remaining commissioners will depart on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<h3>Bandit Leader Xia Sanzi Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Bandit leader Xia San (also known as Xia Sanjianzi) led his followers to occupy the Tenth District last year, causing great disturbance to the farmers. The county government issued an arrest warrant for him. He also kidnapped Liu Pengcheng's young grandson Guan Baozi, and Ye Shoumou's two sons Da Cunzi and Xiao Cunzi, in Guanjiazhuang in the Twelfth District, demanding ransom. Later, this bandit was captured by the Baoying County government in January of this year. County Magistrate Li of this county immediately prepared a document to welcome him back to Gaoyou. After repeated interrogation, he confessed to all his crimes. The county government submitted the case to the provincial government for approval, and he was sentenced to death. This morning (the 16th) at 9 AM, County Magistrate Li ordered the prisoner to be brought to the case, verified his identity, tied him up, and executed him by firing squad at the execution ground outside the East Gate.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<h3>A Robbery Occurred in Xitunxu</h3>
<p>In Xitunxu, about five li from Mayao Town in the southeast of Huzhou, there lived a farmer named Wang Zhaojing, who was a man of modest wealth, and therefore coveted by bandits. On the night before last, more than a dozen bandits, speaking in mixed dialects and wielding weapons such as earthen guns, knives, and clubs, swarmed in, overturning boxes and cabinets, searching at will, and looting all clothing, jewelry, and cash, causing a loss of about 400 yuan.</p>

<p>City News</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei to Return to Nanjing Today or Tomorrow</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang May Return to Nanjing for a Meeting</p>
<p>Unlikely to Resign Firmly as President of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon and immediately met with the heads of various ministries and commissions at the Chu residence on Avenue Albert to discuss national affairs. Although Wang still expressed humility about resuming his post as President of the Executive Yuan, due to the urgent national crisis, he has agreed to return to Nanjing tonight or tomorrow to resume his post. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Visits by Important Figures</h3>
<p>Because his mother-in-law, Madam Chen, resides at the Chu residence, Wang went directly to the Chu residence after disembarking the day before yesterday to catch up. He did not return to his private residence on Rue Cardinal Mercier to rest with his wife, Madam Chen Bijun, until after 10 PM. At around 7 AM yesterday morning, Mr. and Mrs. Wang drove to the Chu residence again. At around 8:40 AM, Finance Minister Song Ziwen visited and talked for twenty minutes before going to the Song residence on Rue Ghisi with Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chu Minyi and Lishi Society Director-General Huang Renlin. At around 10:30 AM, Vice Minister of the Interior Gan Naiguang and Mongolian representative in Nanjing Wu Heling visited the Chu residence one after another, but left their cards because Wang was out and had not returned.</p>
<h3>Filming</h3>
<p>Wang, together with Song Ziwen, Chu Minyi, Huang Renlin, and others, arrived at the Song residence at 9:10 AM. Later, at the invitation of the Mingxing Film Company, they filmed a sound movie in the garden of the Song residence. First, Minister Song gave a speech, briefly stating that President Wang had gone to Europe for medical treatment due to illness, and after hearing of the loss of Yuguan, he was filled with indignation and returned to the country to resume his post despite his illness to comfort the expectations of the people across the country. Wang then gave a speech for about ten minutes, briefly stating that the central government is determined to resist the Japanese invasion, and only resistance is sufficient to survive, and only the unity of the whole country from top to bottom is sufficient to resist the invasion of a powerful enemy.</p>
<h3>Wang Visits Sun Ke</h3>
<p>At 10:20 AM, Wang and Chu Minyi went to Rue Colombia to visit Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke. Chu returned first. Wang and Sun met for about twenty minutes. In addition to reminiscing about their long separation, they discussed diplomatic and anti-Japanese issues. Wang left at 10:50 AM and went straight back to the Chu residence. In the afternoon, he went out again to visit Central Research Institute President Cai Yuanpei and many other people. He did not return to his residence on Rue Cardinal Mercier to rest until late at night.</p>
<h3>Wang's Remarks</h3>
<p>Wang told reporters from various newspapers at the Sun residence yesterday afternoon that he planned to visit Mr. Wu Zhihui and Mr. Zhang Jingjiang tomorrow (i.e., today) and take a military plane to Nanjing tomorrow night (i.e., tonight) on the 20th. There is talk that Chairman Chiang will return to Nanjing in a day or two, so whether or not I will go north to meet with Chiang will be decided after I arrive in Nanjing. As for the position of President of the Executive Yuan, it is a busy and heavy responsibility. Because my body has not fully recovered, I am unable to work hard. If I reluctantly take on the responsibility, I will delay matters and harm the country, which would be a great disaster, so I still intend to reapply for resignation.</p>
<h3>Zeng's Remarks</h3>
<p>In addition, according to Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming, speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency, President Wang is scheduled to enter Nanjing the day after tomorrow (i.e., tomorrow or the day after), and is still asking President Song to continue to hold the post for three times. As for President Wang's statement to reporters in Hong Kong that he would return to the country to resume his post, it was a misunderstanding. Although Wang's illness has not fully recovered, he is eating and sleeping well, and his spirit is very healthy.</p>
<h3>Sun's Remarks</h3>
<p>Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday morning and met with reporters from various newspapers at noon. According to his talk, my visit here is to welcome President Wang. I will return to Nanjing in a day or two. President Wang met with Mr. Hu Zhantang in Hong Kong this time. Mr. Hu has very deep views. As for President Wang's return to work after leave, it is only a matter of time. At this time of serious national crisis, all parties will certainly not allow President Wang to resign. Currently, all parties are determined to resist Japan and should do their best.</p>

<p>Support Association</p>
<h3>Urges He and Song to Counterattack</h3>
<p>Feng Shaoshan Went to Beijing Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Volunteer Army Support Association, due to the urgency of the war at the front and the commendable unity of Sun and Song, has dispatched standing committee member Li Cishan to personally comfort the various armies. After the daily standing committee meeting decided to send Feng Shaoshan north to comfort the troops, he took a train to Beijing yesterday morning, transiting via Jinpu to Ping, and carrying letters to He Yingqin and Song Zheyuan, encouraging them to counterattack. An excerpt is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Letter to He Yingqin</h3>
<p>(Titles Omitted) The Japanese寇 are invading, becoming increasingly fierce. Three provinces have fallen, and Rehe has also been lost. The greedy and venomous aggressors are pointing directly at the interior. The life and death of our Republic of China is at stake. You are in charge of military affairs, bearing the heavy responsibility of defending the country and its people. This time, you are upholding the Central Government's commitment to resistance, personally going to Beiping to command the entire front, turning danger into safety. All the people of the country wholeheartedly support you. Our association deeply understands that the Japanese寇 are advancing systematically with a complete plan, and mere resistance cannot defeat them. Only active counterattacks can recover the lost territories of the Northeast. The Japanese寇 are arrogant, claiming to be invincible. Taking advantage of their arrogance and attacking their weaknesses will surely lead to victory. We dare to ask you to make a decisive decision and immediately order all fronts to launch a united counterattack, to turn the tide and establish the foundation of the country on solid rock. This is what we rely on you for. Because Director Feng Shaoshan is traveling north, we humbly offer our opinions and condolences, and respectfully request your consideration and approval. We are deeply grateful, etc.</p>
<h3>Letter to Song Zheyuan</h3>
<p>(Titles Omitted) The Japanese寇 are invading, becoming increasingly fierce. Three provinces have fallen, and Rehe has also been lost. The greedy and venomous aggressors are pointing directly at the interior. The life and death of our nation is at stake. Your army has been ordered to take charge in this time of crisis, advancing to the crucial pass of Xifengkou. Before the camps could be secured, the enemy army had arrived. Fortunately, you, with your spirit of advancing without retreat and fighting to the death, encouraged the entire army to be determined to sacrifice, fought fiercely all day, drove the enemy out of the pass, and selected elite troops to launch surprise attacks, annihilating the enemy, capturing countless weapons, establishing unprecedented achievements, boosting our military might, chilling the enemy's膽, and with frequent reports of victory, the people rejoiced. In addition to dispatching Standing Director Li Cishan to offer condolences, we, together with the Northeast Refugees Relief Association and the Shanghai Northeast Refugees Relief Association, have jointly remitted 20,000 National currency and sent two telegrams. Now, we are sending Director Feng Shaoshan to represent our association and personally comfort you. We respectfully request your consideration and approval, and hope to receive news of victory from time to time. We are deeply grateful, etc.</p>
<h3>Key Telegrams Between Song and Sun</h3>
<p>Song Zheyuan Replies to the City Chamber of Commerce: Since General Song Zheyuan fought bravely against the enemy at Xifengkou and repeatedly achieved extraordinary results, the City Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram of condolence. It is now learned that the Chamber has received a reply telegram from Mr. Song, the original text of which reads: To the City Chamber of Commerce, After reading the telegram, I have been informed that the Japanese slaves are rampant and running rampant on the border. The traces of blood from Shanghai have not yet dried, and the beacon fires of Yu Shuo have risen again. Zheyuan carries a spear to defend the country and has long been determined. It is only because of a small effect in creating the enemy that he has received an excessive reward. After feeling guilty, he will be more motivated to encourage hope to use his skills to help him. It is prayed for the rate. Song Zheyuan respectfully bows.</p>
<h3>Telegram of Condolence to Song Zheyuan from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Kui Yanfang et al. Send a telegram to Song Zheyuan, commander of the military, Zhu Zi of Beiping forwarded it to Song Zheyuan, Commander of the Army. The brutal sun is determined to destroy our country and realize its continental policy, at the expense of undermining international good faith and treaties, and continues to invade, and our soldiers guarding Rehe actually retreated without a fight, which is heartbreaking and infuriating. Fortunately, the general led your soldiers to use 热 blood to defeat steel and annihilate the enemy, which greatly boosted morale and turned the war around. National rejuvenation depends on it. After admiring it, my colleagues specially accumulated 5,000 yuan and remitted it for condolences. I hope the general will continue to work hard to kill the enemy and defend the territory. The people of the country are the general's support. Kui Yanfang, Li Ming, Lu Jianquan, Feng Gengguang, He Kun Company Yang Zhixiong, Wu Yunzhai's wife, Wu Wang Hanqing, Wu Zhijiu, Li's wife, Li Bohan, Shen Wencui, Shen Wenyue.</p>
<h3>Xiao Zhenying Reports on the War Situation by Telegram</h3>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a telegram yesterday from Xiao Zhenying, Chief of Staff of Song Zheyuan, which reads: Greetings to Mr. Chu Huiseng, Feng Shaoshan, and Yin Zhufu of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association on Guling Road. Since the change in Rehe, the Japanese寇 have driven south and invaded. Our Chairman Song Mingxuan personally led his troops to take over the defense of the Xifengkou area. The enemy encountered the pursuing enemy and resisted head-on. The enemy, with a combined force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery from the 90th and 34th Brigades, as well as aircraft and tanks, attached with puppet troops, went straight to our陣. Our army suddenly encountered the enemy and did not have time to build defenses. Zhao Brigade Commander Deng Yu was wounded while supervising the battle, and Battalion Commander Wang Baohua was killed in action. Our Feng Division Commander Zhi'an led his troops to advance, and morale was boosted. As dusk approached, they began to maneuver. Zhao Brigade Commander Li Chuang led his team out of Panjiakou as the left flank, and Tong Brigade Commander Zeguang led his troops out of Tiemenguan as the right flank, heading towards the enemy's back. At the same time, Tong Jinxuan's Regiment moved horizontally out of Baitai to cut off the enemy's retreat. The enemy army was completely surrounded from all sides. Our soldiers engaged in hand-to-hand combat with broadswords, killing more than 4,000 Japanese寇, seizing 18 new-style field guns, 7 tanks, and more than 4,000 rifles, and burning almost all of the enemy's supplies. The remaining enemy was completely annihilated by the cold morning. However, the enemy suffered too much damage and must not be willing to give up. Now they have mobilized a large part of their forces and are likely to come back with all their strength. Our army lacks air defense and has few sophisticated weapons, relying solely on hand-to-hand combat, which is not a sustainable solution. If you have a patriotic heart and can raise funds to purchase anti-aircraft guns, anti-aircraft machine guns, and air defense equipment, and supplement them continuously, it will surely encourage the hearts of the people and persevere to the end. Xifengkou is the throat of North China, and the enemy must compete for it. The opportunity for survival or destruction is in this last moment. We hope that you will urgently save the country. Xiao Zhenying respectfully bows.</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying Thanks Three Groups by Telegram</h3>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, the Northeast Refugees Relief Association, and the Shanghai Northeast Refugees Relief Association, previously gathered 10,000 yuan to comfort the 41st Army of Sun Dianying. The army's representative, Zhang Youqun, received a telegram yesterday from Sun from□□, which reads: Brother Youqun forwarded to the Volunteer Army Support Association. It is a soldier's duty to kill the enemy and save the country, and he must move forward with a spear and has no regrets. He is grateful for your Association's assistance of 10,000 yuan, which will be used as support. All the officers and soldiers are deeply grateful. Special telegram to express thanks. Respectfully wish you Xungi. Sun Kuiyuan bows and stamps.</p>
<p>Support Association Replies to Li Cishan by Telegram</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association sent a telegram yesterday to its representative Li Cishan in Beiping, which reads: To Mr. Li Cishan in Beiping, Telegram received with respect. Sun Dianying is earnestly resisting Japan and fighting hard without retreating, which is deeply admired. This association has allocated 150,000 bullets and has previously combined with the Northeast Refugees Relief Association etc. to remit 10,000 yuan for condolences. Mr. Zhang Youqun has now arrived in Shanghai for discussions. After a meeting of the standing committee, it was decided to borrow 100,000 bullets from the original allocation of Zhu Jichao's bullets, and allocate another 5,000 yuan for condolences and more than 2,000 raincoats. The bank procedures for the remittance bill carried by you must be renamed. Please send it to Shanghai by express mail so that it can be exchanged. Brother Shaoshan came to the North on the day of巧. Special report, Chu Huiseng, Wu Shan, Chen Yaofu, bows, 篠.</p>
<h3>March 18th Memorial Day</h3>
<p>The Concession Authorities Prepared Temporarily</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 62nd anniversary of the Paris Commune, as well as the anniversary of the March 18th) Massacre, when the Northern Government shot students seven years ago. The police authorities in the Chinese area of this city temporarily prepared strictly. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Situation in the Chinese Area</h3>
<p>The Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Hong恩, ordered the police stations in each district the day before yesterday to be armed and work overtime from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. yesterday. All main roads had double posts, and the police brigade and patrol teams were also fully armed and patrolled the streets to prevent incidents. Special attention was paid to the factory areas in Pudong and Puxi. Until 6:00 p.m., the only incident in the Chinese area was at around 11:00 a.m. near the public stadium on Linin Road in Nanshi, where a small number of people resembling workers carried reactionary publications and attempted to assemble. They were dispersed by the police on duty and did not cause any trouble.</p>
<h3>Situation in the Concessions</h3>
<p>The Public Concession and the French Concession police also notified each police station to send additional detectives and increase posts at key locations to suppress any incidents. The defenses at Nissho Building on Nanjing Road and Daxi Road in Puxi were particularly strict. Fortunately, the evening was peaceful.</p>
<h3>Japanese Yarn is Transferred to Korea</h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Asks Yarn Industry to Ban Enemy Goods</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army launched an attack on Rehe, the boycott of Japanese goods has gone a step further. Japanese ships cannot berth in the Southern China region, and Japanese cotton yarn, which has always been sold the most smoothly, cannot reach the ports of Shantou and Guangdong. The sales of Japanese yarn in Beiyang and the Yangtze River areas have also plummeted recently. The Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai have accumulated a large amount of yarn. In order to promote sales, they have transferred most of it to Korea for sale. They have agreed with the Dalian Steamship Company in this port on transportation arrangements. Last month, 2,000 tons of Japanese yarn were shipped from Shanghai to Incheon. Another part was sold to the Northeast.</p>
<p>New Sound Society says: The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Yarn Industry Association yesterday, which says: We hereby open the letter. On the 17th of this month, we received the first five of the Public Letter of the Shanghai County Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Jiangsu Province, which states, according to a letter from Ding Boqin, a merchant in the second district of this county, Fan Chang and Gong Mao (Japanese merchants) Xiangchang and Ruihe on Wangjia Wharf Street in Nanshi, Shanghai, and four merchants in Xiaodongmen, specializing in selling Japanese cotton yarn with changed brands, selling to various places. Merchants in the Puxi area of this county mostly purchased from these shops because of convenient procurement, not less than tens of thousands of yuan per month. They greedy for private profit and acted as a pawn for the tiger. The crime is no less than treason. The merchants once sent letters to warn them, but the merchants were greedy and continued to sell. Please take measures to ban it, etc. Based on this, it is found that at this time, the Japanese寇 are rampant and the country is ruined. Economic non-intercourse with Japan is generally recognized as an effective way to defend against violence and save ourselves. We should abide by it as citizens. These merchants are transporting enemy goods and deceiving compatriots. After being warned, they have not repented. They are extremely unconscionable. After the 25th Committee Meeting of this Association, a letter was sent to the City Chamber of Commerce, requesting a thorough ban, etc., recorded in the files. In addition to informing the people of the county that they should not purchase from these merchants again, we hereby send you a letter requesting that your Association investigate and deal with the matter and reply.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Journalists Association</h3>

<p>Unite Journalists Nationwide to Purchase Airplanes</p>
<p>And Elected the Second Executive and Supervisory Committees</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association held its second members' congress at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 120 members attended. The congress resolved to send a telegram to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers at the front and unite journalists from all over the country to purchase airplanes for anti-enemy affairs. It also elected new officials. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Congress Officials</h3>
<p>Presidium: Yan Duhe, Yan Esheng, Qu Shao Yi, Zhao Junhao, Hang Shijun; Master of Ceremonies: Wu Zhongyi; Recorders: Jin Huating, Yu Kongwo; Affairs: Jiang Jianhou, Sun Daosheng; Verification: Ma Chonggan, Jin Xiongbo.</p>
<h3>Congress Order</h3>

<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Yan Duhe delivered the opening speech, saying that the association was officially established last year and has not been a year since then. Although its history is short, the association has a great mission to the country and society, especially in the current situation, where there are more pain and difficulties. However, if we want to relieve pain and complete the mission, we must be united. The association's tasks, small in connecting the feelings of members, are to increase knowledge, and it has been approved by the Party, which can be said to be well-organized. In the future, it should develop a healthy force to achieve our mission, etc.</p>
<h3>Representatives' Speeches</h3>
<p>Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Department, said in his speech that organizing an association is, on the one hand, to seek the solidarity of the association itself, and on the other hand, to give play to the strength of the association in order to make contributions to the country and society. The responsibility of the press is even greater. The way to save the country lies in popularizing education, but at this time when internal and external troubles are intertwined, it is no longer possible to handle popular education. The press should take on more responsibility, popularize the idea of saving the country among the people, and realize the Prime Minister's exhortation to awaken the people. Today's election of your association must pay attention to talents and must be able to take responsibility, etc. Zhang Yuanruo, representative of the Municipal Government, said in his speech that the ancients said that it is for the people to declare their words. Western philosophers also said that there are two elements of democratic politics, one is law and the other is public opinion, and public opinion is more important than law. Only public opinion must be common and unified to have power. The press is entrusted with this important mission, etc. Zhou Hanmei, representative of the Social Bureau, said in his speech, briefly, that internal and external troubles have existed since ancient times, but the current so-called external troubles are very different from the past. In the past, it was only a conflict between a part of one's own nation, and now it has become a world problem. The current war is not limited to military affairs. All production and transportation are related to victory or defeat. It depends on the press's publicity and starting from national defense, etc.</p>
<h3>Discussion Proposals</h3>

Chen first reported that Mr. Cai Yuanpei was unable to attend due to illness and Mr. Lin Yutang was unable to attend due to other matters. The reason for convening this members' congress was that the executive committee members elected at the previous congress, including Song Qingling, Cai Yuanpei, Yang Xingfo, Lin Yutang, Yilosheng, Zou Taofen, and Hu Yuzhi, concurrently served as temporary central executive committee members of the association. According to the articles of association, central executive committee members may not concurrently serve as branch committee members.

It was resolved to participate. Wu Mai proposed (1) to further support the cases of Liu Yusheng and Wang Weisan, and the case of the Korean Li Chunshan who was previously arrested; (2) to send three or five representatives to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to investigate the treatment of prisoners. The above two cases were resolved. Wang Qixu proposed that the association should start a publication, which was passed in principle, and suggested that the temporary central executive committee of the association handle it. Wang Zaoshi proposed to expand the organization and broadly recruit members, which was passed. The Congress dispersed immediately and then opened the first Executive Committee meeting of the Shanghai Branch</p>

<h3>Absurd Local Ethics</h3>
<h3>Brutal Sun's Conspiracy Plan</h3>
<h3>Secret Treaty of the Sino-Federal Empire</h3>
<p>Further Disrupting Our Entire Country, Supporting Traitors to Enter the Pass for Restoration</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that the violent Japanese have occupied Northeast China and Jehol (Rehe), and their ambition is not yet exhausted. They have frequently taken actions to spy on Beiping (Peiping) and Tianjin, causing disturbances. Recently, there have been rumors circulating that Japan and the puppet regime have signed a kind of "Secret Treaty of the Sino-Federal Empire." After extensive inquiries, a preposterous plan was obtained and is now revealed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Currently, there are only two types of countries in the world: one is capitalist, including England, America, Japan, Italy, and France, and the other is communist, namely Soviet Russia. To resist Soviet Russia, it is necessary for China and Japan to unite and communicate with England, America, Italy, and France to understand their methods for this to be successful. (2) For China and Japan to unite, Japan must help "Manchukuo" restore the imperial system, eliminate the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) that once allied with the communists. Only then can the Sino-Japanese alliance be successful. (3) According to historical research, there are three ways to pacify the world: one is mass movements, one is military conquest, and the other is historical evolution. Popular elections have already gone bankrupt in China and cannot be applied. Military conquest has failed after Yuan Shikai, Xu Shichang, Duan Qirui, and Chiang Kai-shek. Now, after more than 300 years, the Emperor Puyi (the Xuantong Emperor) can rally popular support and implement a dictatorial system to reorganize the new nation. For China and Japan to unite, it is necessary for Japan to help the Emperor of the Sino-Federal Empire regain power. To help the Emperor regain power, the first step is to recover North China as the foundation of the state; the second step is to follow the example of the ancient state of Qin helping Chong'er of Jin to restore his state, and the examples of England and France helping Poland, Turkey, and various small European countries gain independence, and France helping the United States separate from England, using formal army, navy, and air force troops to eliminate the Communists and the Kuomintang that once tolerated the Communists; the third step is that the Chinese people are impoverished, and the country is financially exhausted. Japan must first provide economic assistance, reorganize the army, banks, and other relief measures, and then raise public bonds from other countries, build railways, exploit mines, reclaim wasteland, and revitalize various industries. If these three points are addressed, the Sino-Japanese alliance can succeed. If Japan intends to help the Sino-Federal Empire restore power, it must secure the area north of the Yellow River as a foundation. To gain control of the provinces north of the Yellow River, first, Japan must deploy 60 warships, with 20 warships occupying Tanggu and Tianjin, 20 warships occupying Qingdao, and 20 warships guarding the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The areas north and south of the Yellow River can be pacified with an edict. Second, borrow 100 airplanes to disrupt the rear of Beiping, Tianjin, and Jehol. Third, warships and airplanes must fly the flag of the Sino-Federal Empire. (4) The Manchu government should secretly subsidize Shandong military expenses with 10 million yuan, Shanxi military expenses with 5 million yuan, Hebei military expenses with 5 million yuan, the military expenses of the Yangtze River provinces with 20 million yuan, the military expenses of Guangdong and Guangxi with 20 million yuan, and the temporary scale expenses for establishing the new state with 20 million yuan, all to be allocated from the "Manchukuo" assets. (5) Japan and Manchukuo should first send secret envoys to detail the permanent basic treaty of the Sino-Federal Empire. Neither side should disclose it. (6) Before the military occupies Beiping and Tianjin, the Manchu administration, with Japan's consent, should announce the constitution, prepare for the restoration plan, and prepare the imperial facilities. (7) After the Sino-Japanese secret treaty is signed, the "Manchu Regent" should send a telegram to the entire country and the secret envoys to prepare for the restoration ceremony. (8) After the Sino-Federal Empire occupies Beiping and Tianjin, the ambassadors of various countries stationed in Beiping, and the ambassadors of countries that signed the Qing Dynasty's relinquishment of power, should discuss mutually dispatching ambassadors to negotiate the plan for the Sino-Federal Empire to eliminate the Communists and resist Soviet Russia's aggression. (9) After the Sino-Federal Empire occupies Beiping and Tianjin, it will convene a federal conference to review the Constitution of the Sino-Federal Empire and exchange strategies for building the Sino-Federal Empire. (10) Because of Japan's friendly assistance in building the Sino-Federal Empire, the Sino-Federal Empire will sincerely organize Sino-Japanese economic alliances, industrial alliances, and various committees, plan the various economic and industrial projects of the Sino-Federal Empire, and military plans will be determined separately. (11) If Manchukuo, Guangdong, Guangxi, or other provinces have special circumstances, they may be allowed by the constitution to become independent states with special organizations. The central government and the provinces north and south of the Yellow River will be divided into two systems: one is an autonomous state, and the other is a mandated state. (12) The emperors of the Sino-Federal Empire should concurrently hold the position of leader of all religions, but the people are allowed to have freedom of belief. (13) For the sake of revitalizing industries and developing roads, the Sino-Federal Empire will allow various countries to reside in the interior and abolish concessions.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Movement in All Sectors</h3>
<h3>Lawyers Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association has formulated measures to raise air defense donations and issued a notice to all members yesterday, stating: "We, the members of this association, have always been patriotic and enthusiastic. Since the September 18th and January 28th Incidents, the violent Japanese have invaded and occupied our Northeast, ravaged our Shanghai, like greedy wild boars and long snakes, taking an inch and wanting a mile. Now, the loss of Yuguan, the fall of Jehol (Rehe), and the shock to North China indicate that the disasters are imminent. The most cruel weapon they use for aggressive warfare is airplanes. Our soldiers fighting against the enemy are brave and forward-looking, but their efforts are still not very effective. This is not because their combat power is not strong, but because their weapons are not sophisticated. Among weapons, those related to the air force are the most lacking. People of our country, in view of this, have loudly called for donations to equip the air force. We, the members of this association, have always been patriotic and enthusiastic. However, while airplanes are essential for aerial combat, anti-aircraft guns are also important for air defense. If there had been one or two dozen anti-aircraft guns in the Battle of Shanghai, the Japanese planes would not have been able to wreak such havoc. Recently, the Northeast Volunteer Army has also repeatedly called for the supply of air defense weapons, which shows that the importance of anti-aircraft guns is no less than that of airplanes. One focuses on increasing the efficiency of air combat, and the other focuses on resisting the tyranny of enemy aircraft. The two complement each other and should not be neglected. Moreover, in terms of training personnel and various equipment, anti-aircraft guns are actually easier to achieve results than airplanes. With the enthusiasm and large number of members of this association, if we can pool our efforts, the results will be considerable. Based on the proposals of members Zhu Fojiu, Yao Jian, Guo Qiming, Feng Buqing, Zhang Zanrong, Li Yiming, Gu Gongbing, Liang Bohua, Yan Dajue, Wu Chengyu, Huang Yuping, Li Junhuan, etc., the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of this association has resolved the following measures: (1) The members' general meeting will allocate 3,000 yuan of public funds; (2) Members will be responsible for raising donations; (3) Members will donate individually, with 10 yuan as the minimum amount; (4) Members will increase air defense donations from their clients for each case, with 2 yuan as the minimum amount, and members themselves will also donate 2 yuan for each case (this association will issue a notice to each member for soliciting air defense donations to be posted in their offices). The above measures should be reviewed by your members and implemented earnestly so that sufficient funds can be accumulated to strengthen air defense, protect the country, and greatly benefit the overall situation. Respectfully submitted, Shanghai Lawyers Association Standing Committee, March 18, 22nd year of the Republic."</p>
<h3>Ningbo Native Association</h3>

<h3>Fujian Natives Appeal for Fish Merchants</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fujian Native Association sent a telegram to the authorities in Nanjing and Fujian, stating: "Respectfully to Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing and Chairman Jiang of the Fujian Provincial Government. Recently, according to the official letter from the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce, the Fuzhou Fresh Fish Guild submitted a letter of complaint, and the representative of the guild, Cai Xunzhong, came to the association from Fujian in person to report that Chen Jichu, the manager of the official tax office of Minhou County's fresh fish, shell, and stone, raised the tax rate, misled the Finance Department. While the merchants were arguing reasonably, Chen Jichu dared to lead a team of more than 20 people, armed with guns and live ammunition, to Yongzhong Pavilion Street at 5:00 AM on February 12th, just when the market was opening. First, he ordered the business to stop, then he opened fire. The bustling market turned into a battlefield. Unfortunately, Wang Zhiben, a shop assistant, was shot in both feet and was dying. Chen Jichu continued his rampage, arresting innocent shop assistant Huang Chunlang and others, and seizing fresh fish worth more than 6,000 yuan, which led to a city-wide strike by fish merchants. Please assist, etc. After investigation, the above facts have been published in the Shanghai newspapers and are extremely illegal. We urgently telegraph Your Ministry (Government) to quickly order the Finance Department to arrest Chen Jichu, who caused the disaster by opening fire, release the innocent shop assistants, and properly set the tax rate to protect the livelihoods of more than 10,000 fish merchants in Fuzhou City, so as to avoid prolonging and expanding the strike. We are waiting for your orders. The Shanghai Fujian Native Association."</p>
<h3>Talks with a Returnee from the Northeast</h3>
<h3>Violent Japanese Manipulating Traitors</h3>
<p>Real Power Controlled by Komai, Many Puppet Officials Arrested, Volunteer Army Lurking Everywhere</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency met yesterday with a friend who came to Shanghai from Harbin and spoke in detail about the current situation in Jilin and Heilongjiang and the anti-Japanese war of the Volunteer Army. The following is a record:</p>
<h3>Manipulating Traitors</h3>
<p>My friend said: "After the Japanese forcibly occupied the three northeastern provinces, they used Puyi to organize a puppet government to achieve their long-cherished wish of annexing the three provinces. The people of our country know this, and all countries in the world also know this. There are fewer Japanese troops in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, and Japanese advisers supervise all agencies. Moreover, the Japanese military police often arbitrarily arrest traitorous officials without asking for reasons. Gao Qilian, the head of the Daowai Police Department in Harbin, has been in office for seven years and is now a traitor. He has been arrested by the Japanese military police five times for no reason. Each time, he was released after paying a fine. The total amount of fines paid was as high as more than 600,000 yuan. Wang Ruihua, the head of the puppet police department in Daonei, was also arrested and released, but was later banned from leaving Harbin. Infuriated and humiliated, he shaved his head and became a monk. Wei Shaozhou, the head of the puppet education department, was also arrested for a trivial matter. Even senior puppet officials have no guarantee, so it is easy to imagine the oppression of ordinary people. In Liaoning, the situation is even worse. Komai, the director-general of the puppet State Council, is like an emperor above the emperor. During the meetings of the puppet government, all proposals are handled by Komai alone. He drafts them in Japanese one day in advance, and at the meeting, he reads them once and then gives them to the puppet officials to sign and announce. This shows how the Japanese manipulate the traitors."</p>
<h3>Volunteer Army Active</h3>
<p>Harbin is located between Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, with convenient transportation and an enlightened population. There is a law and politics university in the city, which is the only institution of higher learning in the two provinces. Because it usually studies international politics, economics, and diplomacy, it is very concerned about the international situation. After the September 18th Incident, the three provinces were lost in less than a month. The teachers and students of the school mourned the loss of the country and were angry at the coming disaster. They returned to their hometowns to promote resistance and fight against Japan. At that time, thousands of people raised the banner of righteousness. During the wheat harvest season, the Volunteer Army of the Republic of China lurked in the fields and ambushed the enemy more than a hundred times. If they gained anything, they would destroy the railway and retreat. Dozens of enemy trains carrying ammunition were intercepted and captured. Last year, when the Lytton Commission, dispatched by the League of Nations, went to Harbin, General Ma Zhanshan besieged Harbin, and there were several police alarms one night, and the impression given to the League of Nations investigation was also very profound. The fact that the investigation report could uphold justice, the tenacious struggle of our Volunteer Army of the Republic of China, and the unrest in the three provinces also had a great impact. Later, because the green curtain fell and there was no place to hide, and because the isolated army was cut off from reinforcements, they could not launch a large-scale offensive. So, a part of them entered the mountains to cultivate land. Now that the situation in Jehol is urgent, Jilin and Heilongjiang are empty, and after the return of spring, the fields are gradually growing, which is the best opportunity for covert action. There are now more than 67,300 people within a hundred miles around Harbin. If they receive ammunition assistance, they will be able to rise again to disrupt the rear of the Japanese. The current distribution of the teams is as follows: Jiang Yunwu is in [blurred], harassing the Harbin-Manchuria line; Li Yonglong is in [blurred], harassing the Hulan-Hai line; Liu Pinzhang is in, Zi Jiujiang is in [blurred], harassing the Harbin-Suihua line; Wang Jiewu is in [blurred], harassing the Harbin-Changchun line; Song Yongzi is in [blurred]; Zhao Jinglong is in [blurred]; Wu Yichen is in [blurred]. The front line has now entered [blurred]. Yang Yaojun recently recovered the counties of Hulin, Mishan, and Baoqing in Jilin Province."</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate Investigation</h3>
<h3>Three Korean Revolutionaries Arrested</h3>
<p>Three Handguns and Two Bombs Seized on the Spot</p>
<p>Three Koreans Attempt to Assassinate Japanese Envoy Arima Akira</p>
<h3>At the Same Time, Several People Were Detained in Cooperation with the French Concession Police and Chinese Police</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that at 9:25 last night, secret investigators from the Japanese Consulate in this port, together with the Hongkou Police, arrested three Koreans at Songjiangchun Restaurant, 271 Wuchang Road, and seized three handguns and two bombs. The method of making them was the same as the ones used to bomb and kill General Shirakawa in Hongkou Park last year.</p>
<h3>Lee Kang-hoon</h3>
<p>It is heard that the three Koreans will be charged with plotting to assassinate Japanese Envoy Arima Akira. One of the three is Lee Kang-hoon, 22 years old, one is Baek Gu-bo, 28 years old, and one is Hyun Hoon. It is currently believed that someone recently used a bomb to attack the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin. They were caught off guard and could not resist arrest, so they surrendered. It is said that the three people came to the restaurant with a man in a Western suit last night, but this man in a Western suit only talked at the bottom of the stairs and then left without going upstairs. Detectives investigated this person last night, but his whereabouts were still unknown when the North China Daily News went to press. Previously, the Japanese Consulate received a secret report that a Korean was plotting to assassinate Japanese Envoy Arima Akira last night. The Japanese Envoy was attending a banquet at a certain Japanese hall on Peng Road that night. Secret agents were stationed all around, patrolling. Then they saw a suspicious person entering the Songjiangchun Restaurant, so they secretly surrounded and arrested him. At a signal, everyone rushed upstairs. All the people were wearing steel-wire vests, so they were even more courageous. When they went upstairs, they saw three Koreans sitting at a table, just starting to eat. Before they could move, they were apprehended. They were disarmed. A package-like lunch box was placed next to them, containing two bombs, one square, weighing about five pounds, and one smaller and round, both made in the same way. According to the inspection by the authorities yesterday, they felt that they were made by Europeans. In order to eliminate the Korean anti-revolutionary party, the Japanese police and Hongkou Police detectives, together with the French Concession police and the Nanshi police, searched various suspected places. Of the two people who were arrested, two lived near 16 Caishi Road near Xujiahui Road. Detectives went to the address to search, and as a result, they obtained information and went to other places to search. For a time, cavalry was dispatched everywhere. The result was unknown because it was late at night. It is said that several people were arrested. As for the three Koreans who were arrested at Songjiangchun Restaurant, they were first taken to the Hongkou Police Station to complete the formalities, and then handed over to the Japanese authorities. It is said that in recent weeks, many Korean revolutionaries have secretly come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>A representative of the North China Daily News rushed to Songjiangchun Restaurant to inquire a few minutes after the incident. According to the shop staff, just after 9:00, two Chinese, one in a Western suit, walked upstairs. A few minutes later, two Western-dressed guests arrived in rickshaws. They stood and talked near the stairs, their voices were very low, and it was impossible to hear what they were talking about, and it was impossible to distinguish their dialect. Before long, one of the people who was talking left, and the other went upstairs to join the two who had arrived earlier and were sitting by the window. The three [blurred] Baek Gu-bo then ordered a bottle of beer and a plate of fried fish. They spoke in Northern dialect, and one of them spoke fluent Chinese, but their appearance was still like Koreans. At first, I didn't pay attention to what the three people were carrying. After I poured wine into three glasses, they drank it all within a few minutes. I went downstairs to urge the chef to bring up the fried fish quickly, and I saw several strange people looking around in front of the shop. A shop assistant wanted to go out for something, but was stopped by a Westerner in uniform. When I looked at the back door, there were also several people in steel-wire vests guarding there. They were not Westerners, and I can be sure they were all Japanese. When the fried fish was brought up, just as the three were about to pick up their chopsticks, the people in steel-wire vests rushed upstairs with shields and batons. I didn't have time to count how many Japanese went upstairs, but there must have been at least eight. In addition, there was a Western patrolman and a Chinese detective. As soon as the people went upstairs, they pointed their guns at the three people. I was shocked, but the three people did not change their expressions, did not jump up, and did not even move from their seats, not even raising their hands. The police searched the three people's bodies, and I was pushed behind the crowd. I later heard that two handguns were found, but I didn't see them with my own eyes. I only saw a small package wrapped in a newspaper placed on the table. At the time, there was also a Chinese diner at another table, who was also pushed behind the crowd after being checked. What I was most surprised by was that the three customers were calm throughout and always showed smiles. One of them, who was wearing a Chinese gown, even laughed loudly when the Japanese police slapped him in the face. The three were then pushed away by the crowd. I didn't see if they got into a car. The three were between 25 and 35 years old. As for the one who left earlier, he never returned."</p>
<h3>Arima Akira to Return to His Country on the 24th</h3>
<p>This Trip Does Indeed Have a Diplomatic Mission</p>
<p>Japanese Envoy to China Arima Akira is now confirmed to depart for his country on the Nagasaki Maru at 9:00 AM on the 24th of this month. According to sources from the Japanese Consulate General, Arima's return to his country this time is due to a telegram from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, instructing him to return to his country to discuss new diplomatic policies towards China. Arima himself has also drafted his opinions on future diplomatic relations with China and will contribute them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for adoption.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM for the dispute over the water cut in Pudong.

Starting from March, the fees will be paid according to the agreed new system. Representatives of various property owners were then consulted for their opinions. The representatives spoke one after another, expressing their firm opposition, because whether the fees will still be paid according to the water meter system starting this month according to the new system, or whether there is a compromise, is deeply doubted. Before there is a clear price list, they will not recognize this method. After repeated discussions, the representatives said that they would wait until the new method is announced before continuing to hold meetings for discussion. The meeting adjourned at around 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Beiping People's Revolutionary Memorial</h3>
<p>Held at the City Party Headquarters Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Beiping People's Revolutionary Memorial Day. The City Party Headquarters held a gathering at 9:00 AM, with representatives from various schools, institutions, organizations, trade unions, and party departments at all levels, led by Chairman Xing. The opening ceremony was as follows: (1) Opening of the meeting; (2) Singing the Party song; (3) Paying the highest respect to the Party flag, the national flag, and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen; (4) The chairman respectfully reading Sun Yat-sen's last will; (5) Silent mourning for three minutes for the martyrs who died on March 18th; (6) Chairman's report; (7) Speech; (8) Shouting slogans; (9) Conclusion. Chairman Xing Wan gave a speech, saying that on March 18th, 1926, the people of Beiping, angry at the international imperialists' excuse for the Dagu Incident, issued an ultimatum to us, held a demonstration at Tiananmen Square, and decided to oppose it. At the same time, they petitioned the Beiping government, but were shot at by the authorities, killing more than 50 people on the spot and seriously injuring more than 80 people. This is the truth of the tragedy. We must commemorate March 18th and, at the same time, deeply understand the meaning of March 18th: 1. Resist imperialism; 2. Overthrow the traitorous warlords. Now China has been arbitrarily invaded by Japanese imperialism, and our beautiful rivers and mountains have been occupied by them. Today, we in the Northeast must commemorate March 18th and, at the same time, should learn from the spirit of struggle of the people of Beiping on March 18th, or contribute wealth to support the anti-Japanese soldiers, so that the anti-Japanese soldiers do not have to worry about the lack of materials.</p>

<h3>Children Racing</h3>
<h3>Death Occurs in an Instant</h3>
<p>Tram Running on the Outer Bund</p>
<p>Child Killed, One Injured</p>
<p>Trams and automobiles racing along the roads of this city create a constant danger for pedestrians who are not careful. Moreover, there are many ignorant children who often play near the roads, chasing each other. If trams or automobiles come speeding by, they do not know how to avoid them, thus increasing the risk of fatal accidents. In the interest of humanitarianism, the authorities have erected signs along the roads and repeatedly issued notices, urging drivers of all vehicles to be extra cautious while performing their duties, to follow the instructions of the traffic police at all times, and to adhere to the speed limits indicated by the signs. Furthermore, parents of young children should pay special attention and never allow their children to run recklessly across the roads to avoid danger. Unfortunately, recently there have still been children playing and frolicking on the roads. Yesterday, another tragic incident occurred in the area of Dada Wharf in the South City, where a child was crushed to death by a tram. It is hoped that citizens of this city will pay attention and restrain their children. The details of the incident are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Chen's Child Chasing on the Road</h3>
<p>Chen Youqing, a man from Jiangbei, is forty years old and makes a living selling fruit. He lives at No. 9, Dacheng Lane, near the Sixteenth Pier Road in the South City. Chen has a son named A Xiao, who is now five years old. Yesterday afternoon around four o'clock, A Xiao suddenly went to play near the Dada Wharf Outer Bund with Xiao Maotou (also five years old), the son of Chen San, who is from the same hometown, and a neighboring child. They were playing and chasing each other on the road.</p>
<h3>Rolled Under the Train</h3>
<p>At that time, tram No. 26 of the China Merchant Tramway Company, traveling from south to north, came speeding by. As Chen A Xiao and the other two children suddenly crossed the road from east to west, Chen Guizhang, the guard on duty at the fourth post, saw what was happening and knew that danger was imminent. He quickly rushed forward and grabbed one child, pulling him back. But it was too late to stop Chen Xiao Maotou and Chen A Xiao, and they were knocked down and rolled under the tram.</p>
<h3>One Dead, One Injured</h3>
<p>Zhang Daguei, the driver of the tram from Jiancheng, did not see Chen A Xiao and the other three children suddenly run out from the roadside. He immediately slammed on the brakes, but it was too late to avoid them. Both children were knocked down and rolled under the tram. Chen Xiao Maotou was crushed by the wheels, resulting in head injuries and a broken left leg. Fresh blood flowed instantly, and with a tragic cry, he died on the spot. Chen A Xiao rolled under the safety guard, suffering severe injuries and fainting from the pain. A crowd quickly gathered, thick as a wall, and all vehicles were stopped. Upon hearing the news, the First District Headquarters immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to maintain order. The China Merchant Tramway Company was notified and sent workers to lift the tram with a crane to rescue the two children. However, Chen Xiao Maotou had already died and was moved to the roadside. Chen A Xiao was immediately sent to the Red Cross Society South City Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Doctor's Examination</h3>
<p>Under the care of Dr. Zhang Jianxiong and nurse Lu Hongyuan of the hospital, it was reported that the child suffered injuries to the left side of his head, a fractured right leg, damage to his right arm bones, and internal heart damage. His life is in extreme danger. The driver, Zhang Daguei, was taken to the First District by police officer Chen. After a preliminary hearing by the district chief, due to the matter involving human life, he was ordered to remain in custody pending further investigation. Meanwhile, Lu Yongde, the head of the Sixteenth Pier, was instructed to report the matter to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy. The traffic stoppage caused by the incident lasted for half an hour.</p>
<h3>Expanding the Second Prison</h3>
<p>Fixed Land Prices to be Issued on Schedule</p>
<p>A notice from the Land Acquisition Committee for the Second Jiangsu Prison states: "For the purpose of notification, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has ordered the expansion of the Second Jiangsu Prison and the organization of a Land Acquisition Committee to purchase land.

<h3>Pudong Native Place Association</h3>
<h3>Discussion on the Design for Building the Association Hall</h3>
<p>Practical discussions come first, with enthusiastic support from the natives</p>
<p>Since its preparation in the autumn of the year before last and its establishment on January 3rd of last year, the Pudong Native Place Association has shown great enthusiasm for the public welfare of its fellow natives. It has also made great efforts in donations for the Northeast Anti-Japanese efforts. Yesterday, a meeting was held in Room 8 on the 8th floor of the Hua'an Building to discuss the construction of the association hall. The meeting started at noon and was attended by Du Yuesheng, Shen Menglian, Mu Jichu, Huang Renzhi, Lu Yuequan, Zhang Xiaoliang, Chuan Zuoheng, Chen Jiaxin, Pan Zhiwen, Zhang Shangzhen, Jin Hongxiang, Yang Shunquan, Wang Qinbo, and others. They also bought about three mu of land next to the Guanghua Grand Theater (in the Public Concession) on Edward Road for a price of over 170,000 taels of silver. The plan is to build a four-story building, which will cost about 400,000 yuan. After preliminary discussions, it was agreed that the natives would separately be responsible for different parts of the building, such as the main hall, side halls, rooms, and general areas. The main hall team would be responsible for 50,000 yuan, the side hall team for 10,000 yuan, the room team for 5,000 yuan, and the general area team for 2,000 or 1,000 yuan. The results of the discussions were very good, and about half of the contributions have already been taken on. During the meeting, Mr. Mu Jichu explained the necessity of building the association hall and the progress made. Mr. Huang Renzhi gave a speech, saying that he had traveled to various provinces and seen the high-rise buildings in Shanghai's concessions, which were all built with the blood and sweat of the people of Pudong. With this labor, forming a group to connect with various native place associations will help compatriots. That's where national salvation lies. Mr. Huang will use this idea to initiate the fundraising. The association will invite enthusiastic natives for an agreement, and then proceed. It is expected that a solid native place association will be seen in Shanghai's people's organizations.</p>
<h3>Wu Suzhong Accused and Detained Again</h3>
<p>Reported by a self-confessed Communist</p>
<p>Extradition requested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Wu Suzhong, a native of Xuzhou also known as Mo Yu, who previously worked as a reporter for a certain newspaper, was arrested in the autumn of the 19th year of the Republic of China by members of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters' Detective Team, with the assistance of the Public Concession Police. He was handed over to the First Special District Local Court for a ruling and transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. The Garrison Headquarters' military judge found the facts to be true and sentenced him to two years in prison, confined to the Caohejing Prison. He was released on amnesty in the autumn of that year after the National Government issued an amnesty decree. Afterwards, he resided at No. 3113, Dongyouheng Road, and continued his old profession, working as an outside reporter for newspapers such as the *Gongbao*. At 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, Wu was walking near the entrance of the Paradise Amusement Park at the intersection of Hubei Road and Fuzhou Road when he was spotted by Lu Keqin, an inspector from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, accompanied by a self-confessed Communist. The latter reported to Inspector Lu, pointing out that Wu was still serving the Communist Party, holding a high-ranking position in the Communist Party's central organization, and using his position as a newspaper reporter to gather information from various agencies about the Communist Party's activities in order to inform his comrades and facilitate their escape. Lu then summoned Chinese police officer No. 1083 and arrested Wu at the Old Gate Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Branch of the High Court, where presiding judge Yu Ting held a joint trial. Inspector Lu submitted the two self-confessed Communists as witnesses, proving that Wu Suzhong, also known as Wu Yue and Zhao Yun, was involved in the alleged activities. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent legal advisor Zhan Jifeng to the court to request extradition. The police station's lawyer, Gan Jingxian, stated that he did not object. Judge Yu then ordered Wu to be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Hunting Association</h3>
<p>Hunting Tigers in Erlong Mountain</p>
<p>The Shanghai Hunting Association's previous hunting trip to Tonglu was cut short due to rain. At the suggestion of members Lu Jiantang, Wang Shuhe, and Shentu Zhen, they are planning another trip to Tonglu. Hangzhou member Zhang Yinsun reported that tigers had recently been spotted in Erlong Mountain, West Lake. Therefore, yesterday, a general meeting was held at the association's address, Room 432 on the fourth floor of the Dalu Department Store. It was decided to depart on the 25th of this month for hunting in Tonglu and to search for tigers in Erlong Mountain to eliminate the menace to the local area. Committee member Liu Jiugao proposed holding a dinner party once a month after the hunting season to strengthen relationships and discuss association affairs. This was also unanimously approved. The Hunting Association is an academic organization. Last week, it entrusted member Yuan Yangan, a lawyer, to draft a document to be submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau for filing, to ensure prudence. It is said that they will also publish a periodical to promote hunting interests.</p>
<h3>Japan Purchases Norwegian Ship to Transport Munitions</h3>
<h3>Chinese Sailors Resentfully Leave the Ship</h3>
<h3>Showing Patriotic Determination, Refusing to Serve the Enemy</h3>
<p>The Norwegian shipping company, "Hualun," owns a ship named "Biaolun" with a capacity of 5,000 tons, which has been sailing on the North-South Outer Ocean route. Recently, due to poor business, the company sold the "Biaolun" to the Japanese government. Due to the tense situation in North China, the ship was ordered to sail from Shanghai to Asaka (transliteration) in Japan to load munitions for import into North China for use by the Japanese puppet troops. The ship had over forty Chinese sailors. Upon learning of this news, they believed that transporting munitions for the enemy to kill their compatriots was not something that patriotic men would do. At that time, their consciences were aroused, and they unanimously decided to leave the ship en masse and voluntarily terminate their employment. They appointed more than ten representatives, including Zhao Yonggan, Gu Baolin, Sen Ayin, and Wang Yousheng, to go to the China Seamen's Special Party Department to seek guidance and request negotiations with the shipping company for the return of their deposits and unpaid wages. The Seamen's Party Department, recognizing that these workers understood righteousness and refused to serve the enemy, praised them as a model for Chinese seamen. Standing Committee Member Yu Jiayong received them, expressed his condolences and encouragement, and dispatched Xu Zhennan, the director of the Labor Guidance Section of the association, to negotiate with the Hualun Company. As a result, the Western manager of the company accepted the workers' demands and personally wrote a guarantee. Yesterday (the 18th), all the wages of the departing Chinese sailors were paid in full. It is reported that all seamen's organizations have unanimously stated that if the "Biaolun" hires Chinese sailors in the future, they will not accept them, in order to show their common patriotic determination not to serve the enemy. However, the ship has already hired White Russians and Chinese to board the ship and sailed out of the Wusongkou on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Appeal in Prison Warden Corruption Case Rejected</h3>
<p>Lu Shaoxun, the warden of the Second Branch Prison of the First Special District Local Court, had only been in office for a little over a month when he colluded with Xia Hepu, the chief guard of the prison, to manipulate figures and embezzle public funds by inflating the prices of prisoners' food. This was discovered by Shen Jiayi of the Second Branch of the High Court. In addition to reporting to his superiors and removing Lu and Xia from their positions, replacing them with other personnel, he also sent the two corrupt officials to the Procuratorate of the First Special District Local Court for investigation. After confirming the facts, a public prosecution was initiated on charges of embezzlement and dereliction of duty. The first instance court sentenced each to eight months of imprisonment. Lu Shaoxun, after being sentenced, was unwilling to accept the verdict and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court, attributing the various acts of dereliction of duty to others and only admitting his own negligence, pleading for leniency and a suspended sentence in view of his unblemished record since taking office. The prosecutor also appealed, arguing that the initial sentence was too lenient and insufficient to deter corruption, demanding stricter punishment. The Second Branch of the High Court held a hearing a few days ago, thoroughly examining the grounds for both appeals. It ruled that the prosecutor's appeal had exceeded the statutory deadline and dismissed it first. As for Lu's appeal, the sentencing was scheduled for yesterday afternoon. Presiding Judge Yu ordered Lu Shaoxun to be brought before the court, briefly questioned him about his age and background, and then announced the main text of the judgment, stating that the appeal was rejected.</p>

<h3>Death of Mother-in-Law Blamed on Daughter-in-Law's Lack of Filial Piety</h3>
<h3>Daughter-in-Law Angered and Drowns Herself in River</h3>
<p>A woman named Zhang Wang, 28 years old, originally from Jinling, whose husband, Zhang Chunling, works as a shop assistant at a foreign doctor's office at No. 21 Museum Road, lived with her mother-in-law, Zhang Huang, at No. 43, Lane 180, Yangshupu Road, East Shanghai. She and her mother-in-law did not get along well on ordinary days. A few days before, they had a slight quarrel over a trivial matter, after which her mother-in-law suffered from a brain illness and died on the 16th of this month. Because of this, her family members blamed her for being unfilial to her mother-in-law, causing her to die from anger. The next day, she felt resentful and conceived the idea of ending her life. She went to the riverside near Lan Road and drowned herself. At that time, Indian police officer No. 303 passed by and saw her fall into the river. He immediately tried to rescue her, but she was already dying. He took her to Sacred Heart Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and she soon died. The hospital reported to the Yangshupu Police Station, which ordered patrolman Hua Changgen to investigate. The body was taken to the Philand Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, the prosecutor of the First Special District Local Court, arrived at the morgue to perform an autopsy. After verifying the identity of the body, he took a statement from the husband, Zhang Chunling, who said that they had been married for ten years and had a six-year-old daughter. They got along very well. He had not quarreled with her this time. Guo then ruled that the deceased, Zhang Wang, had died by drowning. The body was handed over to her husband, Zhang Chunling, who signed a receipt to claim the body for burial.</p>

<p>Mr. Ding Xuan, also known as Zhibai, a native of Xiaoshan, Zhejiang Province, has been the director of the interrogation section of the Third Division of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for many years. He has extensive legal knowledge and outstanding talent and is relied upon by the bureau chiefs Yuan, Chen, and Wen.

<h3>Patrolman Injured Falling from Rickshaw</h3>
<p>Ouyang Wei, the newly appointed patrolman of the Second Branch Office of the Third District of the Yangjing Town Public Security Bureau in Pudong, took office the day before yesterday. Yesterday, he paid visits to the third district and various branches. At 1:00 PM, after visiting Director Zhang, Officer Cai, and Patrolman Liu in the third district, he took a rickshaw to the residence of Yuan, the captain of the second police squadron, in Lujiazhai. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw reached the vicinity of Beihutang Road, the driver accidentally lost his concentration, and the rickshaw suddenly overturned to the side of the road. Patrolman Ouyang fell to the ground. Due to the violence of the fall, his right leg bone was fractured, and he could not get up. The patrolmen of the second squadron noticed it and immediately helped the patrolman onto a door panel and carried him back to the team. The rickshaw driver was also taken to the team. Captain Yuan quickly sent the injured patrolman and the rickshaw driver to the third district. Director Zhang was shocked to see this and rushed the patrolman to Pudong Hospital for treatment. The hospital found that the bones were broken and the injuries were severe. The hospital was not equipped with orthopedic equipment, so it was changed to the Tongde Hospital on Tongfu Road, Puxi for treatment. The rickshaw driver was identified as Cao Mengkai, a 23-year-old from Tongzhou, who lived in Gongquanli, Pudong, and had only been pulling rickshaws in Shanghai for three days. His wrist was inevitably weak, and the road was uneven, causing the overturn. The district director, according to his confession, ordered the person and the car to be detained, and asked the headquarters for instructions.</p>
<h3>Stray Bullet Kills Person, Autopsy Performed</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Third Battalion of the First Regiment of the Central Gendarmerie was firing machine guns at the target range at the Longhua Road West Fort. A stray bullet flew out. Due to the strong southerly wind, the bullet flew out and hit two pedestrians on the east side of the Xiaomu Bridge. At the same time, three coolies were injured on the wharf of the Sun-Hong Sanbei Company. The Xiaomu Bridge and other places were more than three miles away from the West Fort, and it was an accident. The three injured people in Rihui Port were slightly injured and did not report to the Bureau. The injured in Xiaomu Bridge included He Benzong, a 24-year-old from Anhui. The bullet entered his forehead and exited his back of the head. The bullet did not penetrate. He lived in Gaochang Temple and was looking for friends at the weaving factory. Another person, Peng Shengfu, 29 years old, from Danyang, who opened a noodle shop, was shot in the right waist. He was sent to Shanghai Hospital by his family for treatment. He Benzong died on the spot and was taken back to his original location. Yesterday, the local security chief Zhang Li accompanied the people to the battalion headquarters to appeal and received 55 yuan for coffin expenses. The local security chief followed the procedures and reported to the local court for verification. Prosecutor Zhang arrived at the scene and verified the circumstances, and ordered the family members to collect the body for burial.</p>
<h3>General Amnesty for National Political Prisoners</h3>
<h3>He Xiangning Expresses Concrete Opinions</h3>
<p>Sent to the front lines for work after release, Sun Yat-sen gave Chen Jiongming a chance to reform, and revolution is for humanity, so continue his legacy.</p>
<p>Central Committee member He Xiangning recently wrote to the Central Committee members, suggesting a general amnesty for national political prisoners, and entrusting them to lead the north to engage in the relief work of the anti-Japanese army. The Daily News reporter visited He at her residence yesterday to ask for concrete opinions. I am pleased to record the very detailed details below.</p>
<h3>Give a Path to Self-Renewal</h3>
<p>Ms. He first said that the book has been sent out for many days, but there is still no news. Suggestions from those without power are usually dismissed or put aside. My suggestion is correct in both emotion and reason, but it is difficult to say how it will be. I think it's like buying a champagne ticket. Some people think that a general amnesty for political prisoners is a matter for peaceful times, but the amnesty I am talking about is to give political prisoners with the idea of ​​transforming society and loving the country an opportunity to seek self-renewal. Moreover, as I said in my proposal, if the government is not at ease, or if I am not capable enough, it may send personnel to monitor them. In today's day when foreign insults are relying on Ling, it is wrong to not give them the opportunity to serve the country, and to waste their lives in prison. The chaos of society is really due to the accumulation of resentment and poison. If this resentment and poison are not sought to be eliminated, and increased as a result, then political prisoners will never be released, and the country will never be peaceful. Sincere unity and common national difficulty. The gentlemen of the Central Committee have been singing loudly in the clouds in recent years. These political prisoners are mostly revolutionary friendly forces and comrades of the past. Except for not having freedom and power, they are no different from the gentlemen of the Central Committee. Why is there sincerity but no unity, and national disasters are not allowed to be shared? I would like to ask the gentlemen of the Central Committee, how many of you are not political prisoners of the past? With a little empathy, you will naturally accept my suggestion. Many young political prisoners were afraid that they would not rise up in those years, and today they are afraid that they will not die. People who call themselves revolutionaries, looking back on those years, I really don’t know what to think.</p>
<h3>Referring to Chen Jiongming's story</h3>
<p>Ms. He continued that Chen Jiongming's betrayal of the Premier was intolerable by law and morality, but the Premier still allowed him to reform in those years. His subordinates are now also officials in the government. As for the Beiyang warlords who opposed the revolution, they can now be loyal to their comrades, so there is really no reason why these political prisoners cannot be pardoned. Although the behavior of political prisoners has many mistakes, the measures of the party government should also be reflected on. If we judge purely from the revolutionary standpoint, then who is the criminal is very questionable.</p>
<h3>Revolution is for Humanity</h3>
<p>Ms. He also said that some people criticized my move as the expression of humanitarianism. I don't quite understand it. For several years, people who have called themselves revolutionaries have all criticized humanitarianism in unison, but the ultimate goal of revolution does not conflict with humanitarianism. If the revolution is not for humanity, is it for beastliness? If my suggestion is humanitarianism, then it is only the revolutionary spirit of the Prime Minister, which is the humanitarianism of loving people, and the humanitarianism of Mr. Zhongkai, who protects revolutionary youths, and it is definitely not hypocritical and superficial humanitarianism.</p>
<h3>Continue Zhongkai's Legacy</h3>
<p>Finally, Ms. He said that my suggestion is fair and impartial, and the revolutionary standpoint that transcends the party has absolutely no political effect. I always uphold the spirit of the Premier's reorganization of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, and preserve the impression that the Premier gave me in his deathbed will. I will always continue the legacy of Mr. Zhongkai, to overthrow imperialism, to liberate the Chinese and even the suffering of the people of the world, and to realize the people's livelihood of the Three Principles of the People, the socialist society. After the failure of the revolution, I will never join any party. In recent years, many young people have come to ask me to form a party and a faction, but I dare not deceive people, and people cannot be manipulated by me, so I refuse them all. I have never been ambitious, and I have told Gong Bo that I hope everyone will not create orphans and widows, because there are more people who are in the same situation as me and who are more miserable and pitiful than me. If we can truly carry out the purpose of the Premier's national revolution, we may be able to save the tears of many orphans and widows, but what about now? I am not the person who creates political prisoners, and I also ask to release political prisoners, then the person who creates political prisoners should also ask their conscience and support my suggestion. At this point, Ms. He's illness had not yet recovered, and she expressed her fatigue, so the reporter took her leave.</p>

<h3>After Dredging of the Min River</h3>
<h3>Shanghai-Fuzhou Liners Directly to Nantai</h3>
<p>Pioneering Transportation Development</p>
<p>The Min River in Fujian, due to its shallow draft and numerous hidden reefs, only allowed enemy ships going to Fujian to reach Mawei. Passengers and cargo destined for Fuzhou required transshipment by barges, hindering full economic development. Since the reorganization of the Fujian Provincial Government, dredging the Min River to allow through navigation for liners was prioritized, enabling ships from Shanghai to Fuzhou to directly reach Nantai. The first phase of the project has been completed. The Fujian Provincial Government has telegraphed various shipping companies in Shanghai, requesting the opening of direct routes to Nantai. From now on, Fuzhou shipping will not only be able to directly reach the inland river but also facilitate travel to Fuzhou. This matter is of great importance to transportation. Our newspaper reporter made a special trip to investigate various aspects, and the situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Dredging the Min River</h3>
<p>The Min River in Fujian has always been shallow. All passengers and goods destined for Fuzhou were transferred by barges at Mawei, which was costly and cumbersome. In order to develop commerce in Fuzhou City, the Fujian Provincial Government decided to prioritize dredging the Min River to achieve through navigation. Therefore, the Provincial Government established the Min River Dredging Bureau, headed by Lin Zhiyuan, which actively started work, first dredging and clearing the obstructed waterways.</p>
<h3>Avoiding Hidden Reefs</h3>
<p>Within the Min River, from Mawei to Nantai, there are thirty or forty miles of waterway. Normally, the deepest point is no more than twelve or thirteen feet, and in the middle, from Kuaiqi to Bitou, hidden reefs stand densely, making it the most dangerous place for navigation. Merchant ships often have accidents in this section. This time, the Dredging Bureau decided that, for Min River through navigation, it was necessary to remove the reefs at Kuaiqi first. However, as they were difficult to blast, it was decided in consultation with the Fujian Provincial Government to open a new waterway section from Kuaiqi to Bitou, bypassing the reefs, and to straighten the waterway. Since construction began, it has now been completed.</p>
<h3>Successful Trial Voyage</h3>
<p>In 1929, the Yongxing, a ship of the Ningshao Company of Shanghai, with its shallow draft and small tonnage, once reduced its load and tried to sail directly from Fuzhou Inner Harbor to Nantai. At that time, all sectors praised its convenience, especially passengers and cargo owners. Subsequently, due to the uneven depth of the river, there were often obstructions, making it impossible to continue. After this dredging, the entire waterway has been deepened. During small tides, testing has shown a depth of thirteen feet five inches, and during high tides, it can rise to sixteen feet. Last month, the Fujian authorities used a naval vessel for a trial voyage. The result was that a 3,000-ton merchant ship could navigate the Min River with a light load twice and a heavy load once. The largest Shanghai-Fuzhou liners have a draft of fifteen feet.</p>
<h3>Difficulties Resolved</h3>
<p>Initially, when the Yongxing sailed to Nantai, workers at the Mawei pier, barge workers, and others, due to livelihood concerns, had major disputes, causing various shipping bureaus to have many concerns and not dare to change to sailing the Min River. In addition, the Min River was often congested with wooden rafts and bamboo rafts, making navigation difficult. Now, the labor dispute has been mediated by the Provincial Government, so there will be no more disputes for ship resumption. As for the bamboo rafts and wooden rafts on the river, the Min Customs has appointed a special commissioner for management to prevent further obstruction of the waterway. All the difficult points have been resolved.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Shipping Companies Contacted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Fujian authorities, in the name of Lin Zhiyuan, sent a long telegram to Shanghai, notifying various Chinese shipping bureaus, detailing the dredging and deepening of the Min River, and the removal of reefs, as described above. They requested that all regular liners on the Shanghai-Fuzhou route change to sailing the Min River and sail directly. Ships should no longer anchor at Mawei. Not only will this benefit the Fuzhou merchant community by facilitating the loading and unloading of goods, but passengers traveling between Shanghai and Fujian will also avoid the dangers and complications of transshipment. At a time when all sectors in Fujian are firmly rejecting Japanese ships, it is hoped that this will be implemented immediately. The various shipping bureaus in this port, having received this telegram, are already preparing to release Nantai liners and extend the Fuzhou route.</p>
<h3>U.S.S. Rochester Departs Shanghai</h3>
<p>Will Not Return</p>
<p>The "Da Mei Evening News" reports that the U.S. cruiser Rochester, after serving for forty years and having experienced numerous battles, enjoying a long-standing reputation, will depart Shanghai today (the 18th) at 2 p.m. for Manila, and then to Cavite Naval Shipyard for dismantling, never to return to China. The personnel on board will be reassigned to various ships of the Asiatic Fleet. Until the Asiatic Fleet flagship Houston arrives on April 1st, the U.S. naval presence in Shanghai will be undertaken by the USS Oahu.</p>
<h3>Taishan Factory Workers Request Placement</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Meeting Yesterday Without Result</p>
<p>After the Taishan Rubber Factory, operated by Japanese interests on Pingliang Road, closed down in 1930, the factory's entire workforce of over 300 people was placed in various rubber factories by the Social Affairs Bureau in batches. However, there are still over 70 people who have not found employment. Recently, because the factory was taken over by the Central Business, the workers demanded employment from the factory. However, the factory hired new workers and firmly refused the old workers of Taishan Factory. Thereupon, the old workers of Taishan Factory rose up in opposition, and on March 8, they petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. After several investigations by the Social Affairs Bureau, both sides were convened for mediation yesterday morning at 9:00 AM.  The capitalists were represented by Yu Xinyuan and Zhang Fahe, and the laborers were represented by Wu Fuquan, Zhang Desheng, Zhu Qingxiang, Yin Xinbao, and over twenty others. The meeting was chaired by mediator Zhu Jintao. The factory agreed to give priority to employing them, but because the workers stated that they had to start work immediately, the mediation failed.</p>

<h3>The Future of Humanity Reprinted and Published</h3>
<p>At present, all countries in the world are showing signs of instability, with a vague future and unpredictable storms. The fundamental driving force behind this can be traced back to the characteristics of modern culture. American historian Charles Beard saw this and specially compiled this book, inviting famous scholars from Eastern and Western countries such as Pan Su, John Dewey, Hu Shi, Fang Long, etc., to study the culture of the modern world from politics, society, economics, history, and even science, philosophy, literature, and education, to see if there is any fundamental value in its existence, or if it is about to collapse and be replaced by another culture. The whole book is divided into 18 chapters, totaling 200,000 words. Its main points include: (1) Comparison of Eastern and Western cultures, (2) Modern science and its future, (3) Modern commerce and its future, (4) Labor issues, (5) Law and politics, (6) War and peace, (7) Race and culture, (8) Modern religion and its future, (9) Modern art and its future, (10) Modern philosophy and its future, (11) Modern education and its future. China, during this period of drastic changes, should especially understand the trends of the world in order to learn from them. The book was translated by Mr. Yu Xijian, with lively language and fluent translation. It was initially published in the 21st year of the Republic ("The Culture of the Modern World") by the Commercial Press. It was subsequently destroyed due to national disasters. Now it has been re-typeset and printed, renamed "The Future of Humanity." The original book, "Whither Mankind," has sold more than a dozen editions in the United States.</p>
<h3>Special Issue on Living Expenses in the Mechanical Union Journal</h3>
<p>The Mechanical Union Journal, published by the Mechanical Union of this port, has become increasingly sophisticated and rich in content this year. In view of the fact that the income of the average youth in the professional community is often insufficient to cover expenses, the Union, in the 67th issue of the Mechanical Union Journal, has published a special issue on "How to Manage Living Expenses." In addition to soliciting methods of managing living expenses from various people, it has also invited Mr. Wang Zhixin, manager of the Xinhua Bank, to carefully write about "Methods of Managing Living Expenses," and Mr. Yang Weiyu to report on his "Personal Method of Managing Living Expenses," both of which are sufficient to serve as a lesson for young people who generally feel that their income is insufficient to cover expenses. Mr. Xu Zhuodai's short story describing his personal method of managing living expenses, which is both serious and humorous, is especially suitable for young people to refer to when managing their living expenses. Mr. Lu Boyu's "The Effectiveness of Living Expenses" discusses the nature of living expenses and has more unique insights. The remaining twenty articles all have points that can be emulated. This issue has already been published, with doubled pages, and the price is still five silver coins. It is truly a publication that young people in the professional world should not miss.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Mr. Zhu Lü:</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding an item in the local news section of your newspaper on the 17th, entitled "A Woman's Corpse, Great Lament." It stated that Yin A Bao died by hanging due to economic pressure, having to pay four yuan in rent each month and owing the landlord four yuan and two mao, with the landlord pressing her daily. Upon investigation, Yin A Bao's rent was actually only two yuan per month, and although she owed more than (four yuan), the landlord did not pressure her. Furthermore, he repeatedly lent her money for urgent needs. The deceased's wife, Yin Ge Shi, is still alive and can attest to this. Fearing that the rumors are untrue and may cause misunderstandings, I am writing this letter to clarify. I kindly request that you publish it in the "Letter to the Editor" section to rectify the matter. I eagerly await your response.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>A Tenant on Qingyun Road, Zhabei,</p>
<p>Yin Ge Shi (deceased's wife),</p>
<p>Witnesses: Ni A, Mao Zhongbao, Zhao Zhulin,</p>
<p>Sixteenth Ward, Nanhua, Nos. 22 and 38.</p>
<p>To the esteemed [Editor]:</p>
<p>Regarding the news item in the local section of your newspaper on March 17th about Dr. Yan Fuqing leading a team north for relief efforts, it briefly stated that the Northeast Association, in light of the intense fighting in North China and the urgent need for relief work, decided at a general meeting to send Dr. Yan Fuqing to lead a relief team to the front lines. This was accompanied by a telegram from the Northeast Association. However, Dr. Yan's departure with the team for relief work was actually a joint decision by our association, the Northeast Refugees Relief Association, the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, and the Shanghai Northeast Refugees Relief Association. Your report does not accurately reflect the facts. Please publish this letter in the "Letter to the Editor" section for correction.</p>

<h3>Readers' Advisory</h3>
<h3>The Question of "What is China's Illness?"</h3>
<p>Letters from Mr. Pu Bingjun of Jiangyin and Mr. Bai Chao of Nanjing:</p>
<p>Since the *Shen Bao* established the Readers' Advisory column, I have been following it closely. I often see the insightful discussions between the advisor and many readers, providing detailed and accurate answers to various questions, which I greatly admire. However, I am not satisfied with the advisor's recent two responses to Mr. Shen Zuguang's question ("What is China's Illness?"). I feel that the advisor did not sincerely answer Mr. Shen from an advisory standpoint. Although Mr. Shen lacks research on modern political theories, and his discussion contains contradictory points, the question he raised ("What is China's Illness?") is worth discussing. Mr. Shen's attitude is sincere and earnest ("What is the definition of a state? What is the definition of a government?"). After pointing out Mr. Shen's errors, the advisor should have followed up by telling him what the accurate definitions are. Since the advisor has a fundamental understanding of ("What is China's Illness?"), he should provide Mr. Shen with a detailed answer. Many *Shen Bao* readers want to know ("What is China's Illness?") and may not know the definitions of "state" and "government." The advisor does not need to wait for them to study "modern political theories" before discussing and answering the question! In the introduction to the Readers' Advisory column, I remember a line that says ("Everyone has the obligation to answer questions"). Advisor, please fulfill this obligation!</p>
<p>The articles published in the Readers' Advisory column a few days ago, when read side-by-side, left me utterly confused. Originally, as an outsider, I had no clue what was going on and saw no need to meddle. However, under the grand topic of "Where Does China's Problem Lie," seeing irrelevant, tangential, and absurd arguments that were completely off-topic was truly laughable and shocking.</p>
<p>What stage has China reached now? Foreign aggression is intensifying daily, and domestic affairs are neglected. Although the government is temporarily cooperating with Japan, will it be able to cooperate fully in the end? Furthermore, natural disasters and man-made calamities, the deep penetration of imperialism, the bankruptcy of the rural economy, education, politics, and especially finance, are riddled with holes! Instead of discussing solutions to offer to the government for adoption or to awaken our compatriots who are intoxicated in apathy, or to show the masses a way out, or act as a beacon in the darkness or a compass for those who lost direction, what is the use of meticulous wording? This is not a product of the literary society, dedicated to language. Here we're talking about actual, personal problems!</p>
<p>After speaking for so long, as for where exactly China's illness lies, I can offer the simplest and clearest answer: it lies in a change of heart in the minds of 400 million people. Only when all 400 million people hold thoughts of upward progress will China's great illness quickly improve. Don't believe it? Look at how exhausted Germany was after the European war. Weren't the treaties imposed by the Allied powers more difficult than China's current situation? However, the national spirit within them did not die, and everyone wanted to progress. After 13 or 14 years of effort, Germany actually recovered to its pre-war health. Therefore, I say that China's illness is not to be feared, no matter how difficult or complex it is. As long as there is a change of heart within the 400 million people – the restoration of the national spirit – it will get better. As for how to change the hearts of the 400 million people and how to encourage upward progress, that is beyond the scope of this article. Very well, now that we've talked about how the 400 million people should make progress, let me also raise a question: what is the path that all compatriots should recognize? (Reply to be published tomorrow.)</p>

<h3>Researching Chinese Culture</h3>
<p>Kang Fund Donates 200,000 Pounds</p>
<p>Annual Grant of 775 Pounds to Oxford and Cambridge</p>
<p>And Establishment of Chinese Dormitories</p>
<p>Caring for Chinese Students</p>
<p>*Zi Lin Bao* London Dispatch, January 30: Since the announcement last week that Oxford and Cambridge Universities have received donations from the Universities China Committee to newly establish lectureships in Chinese language and literature, with special emphasis on religion and philosophy, there seems to be an opportune moment to describe the work of the Universities China Committee. The committee was officially established only about a year ago, but its origins date back to 1926, when it was purely a voluntary service. Mr. Sherrill Cocke was the most ardent proponent, hoping to enhance cultural relations between the two countries. He invited Dr. Hu Shi and others to England to give lectures, but due to a lack of funding, there was little progress. It was not until the Kang Fund donated 200,000 pounds that it was able to proceed actively. The committee was officially established eleven months ago, and Sherrill Cocke was publicly elected as secretary and advisor to Chinese students. The first step was to donate 775 pounds annually to Oxford and Cambridge Universities for ten years. Other universities also received similar donations, totaling 3,000 pounds, to promote the study of Chinese culture. The committee has a grand plan to encourage nationwide research into Chinese culture. Currently, London specializes in language, literature, art, and antiquities; Oxford studies religion and philosophy; Cambridge studies history and geography; and Manchester studies economics. Perhaps at least one position in this professorship will be filled by a Chinese scholar. In addition, the committee has a plan to encourage Chinese students to study in England. It has established a Chinese dormitory, China House, on Gower Street to accommodate Chinese students and provide information about studying in England. Students going to England can write to the dormitory in advance, and all difficulties and questions can be resolved. Although the committee does not intend to subsidize Chinese students financially, it may provide assistance in special circumstances, such as for students whose families were affected by the major floods in the Yangtze River basin last year and were unable to afford the fees. The committee lent a total of 700 pounds.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Abolishes Education Bureaus in Eighteen Counties</h3>
<p>Special Third Section Established to Handle Educational Administration</p>
<p>Section Chief Recommended with Qualifications of Education Bureau Director</p>
<p>Since receiving the order to abolish education bureaus in eighteen counties, including Lishui in Jiangsu Province, they have reported to the provincial government on the closures and requested instructions on how to establish a section. The provincial government ordered the Civil Affairs and Education Departments to jointly draft a reply. After receiving the order, the two departments drafted the measures in accordance with the newly promulgated County Organization Regulations and reported them to the provincial government for approval and implementation. The key points of the content are as follows: (1) The county government should establish a third section to specifically handle educational administration; (2) The section chief should be recommended by the county based on candidates with the qualifications of an education bureau director and appointed by the department; (3) The staff within the section should be selected from the staff of the education bureau through assessment; (4) The current county supervisors should not be replaced during the school term. It is also heard that the funds for the section should be followed after the Department of Finance makes a decision.</p>

<h3>World New Education Conference and Returns Home</h3>
<p>Chen Hexian, former Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, went to Europe last year with Mr. Li Shizeng to participate in the World Cultural Conference and the World New Education Conference convened by the International Federation of Trade Unions. He has now completed his duties and returned home. The reporter met with Mr. Chen yesterday and asked about his trip. According to him, he was honored to participate in the conference and clearly understood the current state of new educational facilities in various European and American countries, which are worthy of being used as a model for our country. Therefore, our country's participation in the conference was very meaningful. After the conference, the League of Nations dealt with the Northeast issue. The Japanese side worked hard to promote its views in Geneva and France, causing confusion in international public opinion. Recognizing the importance of international propaganda and with the assistance of friends in Europe, he organized a group to send people to participate in the Japanese meetings to investigate their content and publicize the facts to fulfill their national duty.</p>

<h3>Scheduled Distribution of Medicines to Schools</h3>
<p>From the 21st to the 23rd of This Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has instructed the municipal primary and secondary schools in Gaoqiao, Zhabei, and Hunan, stating that school health is valued for its practical implementation. Last year, a training course for school health personnel was held, and school health knowledge was taught separately. To enable schools to treat common illnesses of students, the Health Bureau has sent eleven kinds of medicines, including ammonia spirits, with labels and instructions for use, to be distributed to schools free of charge for application. The distribution will be held at the bureau's drug store from the 21st to the 23rd of this month. Schools should send personnel with receipts stamped with the school seal and baskets for storing the medicines. These medicines should be placed in the medicine cabinet in the school's health room.

<h3>Ministry of Education Supervisor</h3>
<h3>Report on Inspection of Education in Shanxi Province (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Twenty Recommendations on Improving Administration, Funding, and Teaching</p>
<p>In October of last year, the Ministry of Education, for the purposes of (1) conveying the central government's educational policies, (2) urging the implementation of ministry orders, (3) examining the effectiveness of local educational administration, (4) reviewing the allocation and expenditure of educational funds, (5) inspecting and guiding the facilities of education and social education at all levels, (6) examining the academic atmosphere and moral education, and (7) evaluating the achievements of school personnel, sent supervisors Dai Xia and Yu Senwen to inspect Shanxi Province. The inspection lasted two months, during which they inspected 15 educational administrative organs, 8 higher education institutions, 33 secondary schools, 24 primary schools, and 9 social education institutions, totaling about 90 educational institutions. It is heard that the two supervisors have prepared a general report, which has been submitted to the deputy minister of the ministry for review. It is learned that the content of the general report summarizes the facts and lists opinions. In addition to reporting on the inspection process, it is divided into three main parts: the first part describes the evolution of education in the province and the main reasons for its setbacks; the second part describes the current state of education in the province, which is divided into (1) educational administration and funding, (2) higher education, (3) secondary education, (4) primary education, and (5) social education; and the third part describes recommendations for improving education in the province.</p>
<p>The main part of the above general report is the twenty recommendations for improvement. Here are excerpts of left, the other parts are about the general situation, or to find benefits, and the words are verbose, so they are omitted.</p>
<p>(1) Educational administrative organs at all levels should unify their powers, strengthen their work, and strive to increase administrative efficiency. Matters related to the implementation of orders from above should be implemented quickly. Cases should be processed regularly or ad hoc, and reports should be submitted with priority. Various educational statistics should be compiled quickly and accurately for review. Public officials who are not qualified or who are ineffective in their work should be strictly assessed and punished accordingly.</p>
<p>(2) Supervisors at all levels should employ those with rich experience in running schools and should not hold other positions concurrently. They should also specify standards and carefully inspect and guide. The reports they prepare should be summarized and sent to higher-level supervisors for reference.</p>
<p>(3) The administrative organization of schools at all levels should strive for simplicity in form and order in the system. Overlapping agencies should be reduced to unify authority. Middle and primary school principals should uniformly shoulder the main tasks of teaching, administration, and moral education. Teachers should be assigned to these roles, and depending on the nature of the school, a minimum number of administrative staff can be appointed to assist them if necessary.</p>
<p>(4) The service status of principals and teachers at all levels should be supervised and inspected from time to time. Those who are found to be mismanaging affairs or lacking in performance should be strictly identified and eliminated quickly. Qualified personnel should be selected to fill their vacancies, and talent from other provinces should be recruited to provide adjustments. Teacher training graduates from previous years should be identified and reviewed. In addition to assigning the best performers to jobs first, a special teacher training course should be established in Taiyuan City to train them with new-style teacher training.</p>
<p>(5) Educational funds should be requisitioned by the financial authorities in advance to avoid diversion or delay. The annual expenditures of schools at all levels should also be strictly inspected, and strict standards should be set to prevent embezzlement and waste. The expenditure of funds in schools at all levels should eliminate long-standing abuses, consolidate school property, enter as out, and save money for spending. The accounting method should be changed to new-style bookkeeping, and public disclosure should be earnestly implemented. Reduce administrative expenses to build facilities. Improve teachers' salaries to facilitate restrictions on concurrent teaching. The number of free scholarships for poor students above the middle school level should be increased appropriately.</p>
<p>(6) The establishment of classes and the distinction of levels at all levels should be based on the needs of society and the convenience of learning. It is not appropriate to be fragmented and overlapping, the levels are not connected, and the levels are incomplete, so that the students are disappointed. The operation should also be based on the school as the main body, and it is even more inappropriate to abandon the fundamentals and pursue the development of affiliated institutions. The total name and reality should be examined and strictly rectified, so that the facilities meet the needs and the money is not wasted.</p>
<p>(7) Shanxi University must add departments, increase its budget, recruit good teachers, improve its curriculum, improve its standards, eliminate redundant staff, and replenish its equipment. When necessary, the state can use its power to promote the realization of its innovation. Departments of independent colleges and specialized schools that are repeated should strive to be merged with Shanxi University. Those who are improperly operated and have poor grades should be ordered to stop first. The remaining schools can be audited by the department to set standards.</p>

<h3>Municipal Botanical Garden to be Built</h3>
<p>Located at Gaochang Temple Gezhi Academy</p>
<p>Education Bureau Has Submitted Application to Municipal Government for Approval</p>
<p>The campus of the Shanghai Municipal First Public School has always been a place for teachers and students of all levels in the city to observe biology directly, as well as for citizens to enjoy in their spare time. The number of daily visitors often reaches a point where it cannot be managed. Since the western and central base buildings of the garden were borrowed by the Municipal Experimental Primary School and Shangwen Primary School for the construction of school buildings, classrooms, or recreation areas, the garden area has been shrinking daily, making it impossible to develop. The Municipal Education Bureau has repeatedly discussed relocation to expand the garden. Appropriately, the Gezhi Academy buildings, which the bureau previously took over, have been empty for many years and are deteriorating daily. It is planned to use the site to build a botanical garden. However, due to the city treasury's deficits, progress has been slow. Currently, Shangwen Primary School urgently needs to be rebuilt due to its dilapidated school buildings. During the demolition and construction, almost the entire original site will be removed from the route and the eastern garden base will be occupied. Due to environmental constraints, there is no time to delay. Therefore, the bureau submitted a detailed draft plan for the construction of the botanical garden, a layout draft, and a construction budget to the municipal government for approval and requested funds for construction.</p>

<h3>Alas, the Ever-Victorious Army</h3>
<h3>Donghua Actually Loses to Western Police</h3>
<p>Result: 0-1 Fatal Penalty Kick Unremarkable Performance</p>
<p>The Donghua football team, which won the Western League Football Group A Championship, played its last Western League Group A match yesterday against the Western Police at the China Baseball Field as a farewell commemoration. Five to six thousand spectators all hoped that Donghua would have a perfect ending and maintain the honor of being an ever-victorious army. Who knew that things would go against their wishes? Due to the absence of center forward Li Yichen, the forward power was weak, and there were occasional lapses in the defense, allowing the Western Police to score a goal in the second half. Donghua suffered a miserable defeat of 1-0. As for the performance of the two teams, neither was brilliant, so it was difficult to arouse interest from beginning to end.</p>
<h3>Donghua's Forward Line Weak</h3>
<p>Donghua's defeat yesterday was truly unfortunate. The back and defense remained the same as before, without any changes. However, in the forward line, because of Li Yichen's absence, Lu Enzhong took his place, which greatly reduced the team's strength. Lu is a famous goalkeeper, not a forward. His footwork is clumsy, his routes are unfamiliar, and the defense seemed to lack its former solidity, which greatly reduced the team's strength. The team lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Wanxiangting</p>
<p>Li Ning Tu Kaiyuan Cao Qiuhua</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan Feng Yunyou Lu Zhongen</p>
<p>Guan Xun'an Wu Youliang Chen Jiaqiu</p>
<p>Chen Yutian</p>
<h3>The Western Police Team Was Also Incomplete</h3>
<p>As for the Western Police lineup, it was also incomplete. The goal they scored was entirely due to luck. The forwards were all rookies. Hore, originally a good midfielder, was used as a left winger, which was not his strength, and he rarely made any contributions. Jack, originally a right inside forward, was also less effective as a right winger. The others, such as Turner and Defei, were all mediocre. Francis, who played center forward the year before, suddenly appeared yesterday, playing left midfielder, and was certainly not as steady as Hore. The inside midfielder Jebson was also average. However, goalkeeper Bratley was particularly outstanding. In short, since neither side had a complete team, there was naturally no wonderful performance. The outcome depended on luck.</p>
<p>Francis Hore</p>
<p>Gebson Turner</p>
<p>Bratley Zha Pai Ke</p>
<p>Xiao Tuo Defei</p>
<p>Huisi Wu Jack</p>
<h3>The Situation Was Flat and Uninteresting</h3>
<p>At 3:00 PM, referee Chen Jixiang ordered the game to begin. The Western Police kicked off, and both sides fought for the ball. Wanxianghua sent a high ball in front of the goal, and the goalkeeper saved it for a corner kick. Xiao Wan passed it out, and Cao Qiuting shot quickly, but it went too high. Lu Zhongen also had a chance to attack, but the shot went wide. The Western Police launched several counterattacks, but it was difficult to get close to the goal. Two corner kicks were also ineffective. The back and forth was very lifeless, and the overall situation was quite flat.</p>
<h3>Four Corner Kicks Were a Waste of Effort</h3>
<p>Donghua had four consecutive corner kicks in the opponent's area. First, Chen Yutian kicked it out from the right, but the goalkeeper deflected it. Then, Wanxianghua kicked it from the left. Both times, the Western Police kicked it into a corner kick. When the third kick was sent out, it was intercepted and kicked out in front, without any benefit. The Western Police's Parker then dribbled the ball forward, advancing straight in without any obstruction, directly to the front of the goal. Zhou Xianyan was isolated and helpless, and there was no way to save it. Fortunately, the shot went wide, otherwise Donghua would have been in danger. Although this ball did not go in, Zhou Xianyan's foot was injured by Parker and he fell to the ground. Lu Zhongen replaced him. Before long, Zhou continued to play. The first half then ended.</p>
<h3>Donghua Lost Ground with an Arbitrary Penalty</h3>
<p>After the break, Donghua suddenly encountered a dangerous situation. Li Ning touched the ball with his hand next to the penalty area line and was penalized for an arbitrary penalty. The Western Police midfielder Huisi Wu kicked it in front of the goal. After a long melee, the ball suddenly landed in the upper left corner of the goal. The Western Police's Hore seized the opportunity and rushed up to attack. Zhou Xianyan managed to tap the ball slightly, but it did not go far enough and was still kicked into the goal by Hore. Donghua then conceded a goal, only seven or eight minutes after the start of the second half.</p>
<h3>Li and Zhou's Quarrel Was Unfortunate</h3>
<p>After Donghua conceded the goal, Zhou Xianyan and Li Ning suddenly had a quarrel. The reason was unknown. Li Ning then left the field halfway, put on his coat, and went out. Less than five minutes later, Li returned to the field to change his shoes and continued the game. Li and Zhou have been playing football together for many years. It is unfortunate that they had a disagreement. It is hoped that they can put aside their prejudices and return to their former friendship.</p>
<h3>Donghua's Counterattack Was Powerless</h3>
<p>After conceding the goal, the entire Donghua team was furious and launched a fierce counterattack. They charged left and right, and the momentum was strong. The Western Police goal was besieged and surrounded. Yu Tian and Jia Qiu both had accurate shots, but the Western Police goalkeeper Bratley was good at feinting and was able to cope effectively, making it impossible for Donghua to find an opportunity. In the last ten minutes, Donghua was threatened by the Western Police and almost conceded another goal. Zhou Xianyan saved many dangerous balls. Before the end of the time, Wanxianghua had a corner kick opportunity. Donghua made a desperate attempt, but it was still ineffective and they had to accept a miserable defeat of 1-0.</p>
<h3>Reviewing Old Accounts and Looking Back</h3>

<h3>Youyou Wins Against Lakers</h3>
<p>No Score in the First Half 3-1 in the Second Half</p>
<p>The Youyou football team met the Lakers at Hongkou Park yesterday for a Group A match, defeating them 3-1. The score was 0-0 in the first half. Chen Guangyao performed very well. The Lakers were getting worse and worse and were beyond recovery. The referee was Zhang Le.</p>
<p>Youyou Team</p>
<p>Ye Jinjin Li Shuoyou</p>
<p>Wang Shusen Sun Jinshun</p>
<p>Liang Gonglian Huang Ruihua Hu Youcheng</p>
<p>Qian Yaobin Xi Qiaosheng</p>

<p>Ma Er Basailie</p>
<p>Luo Bozhibei Kaiweier Haihuade</p>
<p>Luo Gen Nikefu</p>
<p>Bolote Beigeer</p>
<p>Zero to Zero in the First Half</p>
<p>At the end of the first 45 minutes, neither side had scored. They advanced and retreated, attacked and defended. Some opportunities were missed, and some attacks failed to hit the target. After three quarters, Youyou had zero, and Lakers also had zero.</p>
<p>Xi Qiaosheng's First Goal</p>
<p>The second half started, and after 15 minutes, the situation remained the same. The Lakers were penalized for an arbitrary penalty. Sun Jinshun kicked it, powerfully and accurately, straight to the goal. Although Luo Bozhibei caught it, he lost his grip and it fell to the ground. Xi Qiaosheng arrived just in time, ran up and lightly tapped it in, and Youyou opened the scoring first.</p>
<p>Sun Jinshun Two to One</p>
<p>Youyou's momentum was too strong, and Lakers' defeat stimulated their fighting spirit. Center forward Haihuade dribbled in alone and succeeded, making it 1-1. Youyou then launched another attack. Sun Jinshun shot at the goal with force. The ball hit Luo Gen's foot, and Luo Gen hooked it back, scoring an own goal. Youyou took the lead again with a score of 2-1.</p>
<h3>Li Shuoyou Completes All the Work</h3>
<p>In the last ten minutes, Youyou continued to advance relentlessly. The "locomotive" Chen Guangyao attacked along the touchline and passed far to the left. Li Shuoyou shot and scored, completing all the work with a score of 3-1. Among Group A, Youyou also jumped to the top.</p>
<h3>Jinan Wins First, Then Loses</h3>
<p>Ajer Wins Five to One Jinan Scores a Penalty Kick First</p>
<p>The Jinan football team played its second Group A match against Ajer yesterday at Yiyuan. Jinan scored first in the first half, but in the second half, under Ajer's fierce attack, they conceded five goals in a row. As a result, Ajer won again with a score of 5-1. The lineups and brief situation of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Ajer</p>
<p>Hughs</p>
<p>Docktou Gordon Ramond</p>
<p>Hunto Hayes Hui Lie</p>
<p>Hayes McGracin Maitaweixu</p>
<p>Li Te</p>
<p>Jinan Team</p>
<p>Fu Hexuan</p>
<p>Gu Shangxiang Yun Fengdi Yin Guiyi</p>
<p>Xu Heng Liang Shutang Chen Zhenxiang</p>
<p>Lai Zuorong Chen Jinzhi Zhang Hongzao</p>
<p>Zhong Yongsheng</p>
<h3>Break Through the Encirclement</h3>
<p>Jinan's strength was weakened due to the absence of several main players. Jiang Shanjing injured his leg, and Luo Haiguang and Wang Nanzhen were unable to participate due to the Jiangda basketball game. Although Jinan kicked off first, Ajer immediately launched a fierce counterattack. Maitaweixu had a very good opportunity in front of the goal but failed to score. Hughs also missed the opportunity. The ball was constantly circling in Jinan's territory, but it was difficult to get out. Jinan defended hard, and the enemy was unable to succeed. Under the heavy encirclement, Jinan was given an opportunity to break out. Gu Shangxiang shot an arbitrary penalty 30 yards from the goal. Although the force was strong, the ball bounced back. Zhong Yongsheng dribbled the ball alone from right to center. Ajer's defenders all fell into the trap, and the goalkeeper rushed out, seeing that the goal was in danger. It was a pity that Zhong could have lightly kicked the ball in, but he missed the opportunity. It was not easy to get this opportunity.</p>
<h3>Penalty Against the Enemy's Goal</h3>
<p>After Jinan firmly defended for 30 minutes, Jinan broke out twice. Yin Guiyi broke through Ajer's defense and went straight to the goal. The goalkeeper Hentou caught the ball with his hand and the ball flew backwards, almost bouncing in. Fortunately, Docktou saved it. Again and again, Jinan broke through for the third time and got an opportunity for a penalty kick. Zhong Yongsheng advanced straight along the side and hooked it in from the baseline. In the confusion, the referee found that Hayes had touched the ball with his hand and awarded a penalty kick. Gu Shangxiang rushed up and shot it in. Jinan scored first in an adverse situation. In an instant, the first half ended. Jinan one, Ajer zero.</p>
<h3>Lost Five Times in a Row</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Ajer's counterattack became even fiercer and they surrounded Jinan's goal again. Goalkeeper Xu Heng was unable to cope. Although he failed in the end, Xu had done his best. Defender Gu Shangxiang fought bravely against the army and his contribution should also be noted. Under this fierce pressure, Jinan lost five goals in a row. Five minutes after the kick-off, Hui Lie took advantage of Heng's rush out and shot in a goal, making it a 1-1 tie. After another five minutes, Li Te hooked up a ball and Xu Heng grabbed it but it had already gone in. Twenty minutes later, Maitaweixu shot from 20 yards away and the ball went into the net with great force. When there was only a quarter of an hour left, Hughs shot downwards and Xu Heng fell to the ground, but the ball had already gone in. In the last five minutes, Hayes shot from afar and Xu Heng撲ed the ball into a corner kick. Hughs kicked it and the east wind blew it in. It was also miraculous! The game ended with a score of five to one.</p>

<p>The Baihong Track and Field Team, which represented the Jingwu Athletic Association two years ago in the Suzhou-Shanghai long-distance race, pioneering a new era for long-distance running in our country, has received much praise. Recently, with the completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, there is another plan for the Shanghai-Hangzhou long-distance race. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway is 216 kilometers long, approximately 400 Chinese miles, which is several times longer than the Suzhou-Shanghai race. It must be divided into several days to complete the run. It is now planned to spend the second night in Haiyan and the third night in Haining. Haiyan and Haining are both important towns, and renting apartments and preparing food will not be a problem. However, there is a lack of a suitable location for accommodation between Shanghai and Haiyan due to long distance. The team had previously sent people to Jinshanwei, Jinshanzui, Beiku, and Caojing to investigate. It is said that these places are all in the countryside. Jinshanwei and Jinshanzui are about a mile away from the bus station. Although there are villages, they are very quiet. Even a small sundry stall is not available, let alone a hostel. Currently, only two households have been found in Caojing. After the local public security bureau's persuasion, they were willing to allocate several rooms and prepare bedding. The team considered that this result was rare, so they made a decision. It is now decided to depart from the old Ximen of Shanghai on April 14th and complete the run in four days, and then visit Hangzhou for two days before taking a car back to Shanghai. Baihong team members participating in the long-distance race include Chen Xuzhou, Huang Shengbai, Li Yagu, Xu Yanbo, and others, totaling ten people. In addition, non-team members are also welcome to participate. All treatment is the same as that of the team members, without distinction, to increase interest and promote the grand event. Shanghai has many long-distance running athletes. Upon hearing this news, there must be many who will eagerly volunteer.</p>

<h3>The Little Hero as I Heard</h3>
<p>— Danlu</p>
<p>Fifteen-year-old Wang Guanyun is the name of a little hero. It seems that the newspapers at sea have not recorded it; perhaps it has been recorded, but I have not seen it. The history of the little hero I know was found in the Hong Kong Circular Daily. This is worth introducing in order to excite the patriotic enthusiasm of our patriotic youth.</p>
<p>The little hero, from Lin Yu Village, is an orphan who lost his father early. In order to protect his property, he learned martial arts to defend himself from an early age. At the age of eleven, his marksmanship had already made those who were older and more experienced in this way gasp in amazement! When the September 18th Incident occurred, the little hero was only thirteen years old, but he knew to emulate the ancient Wang Tongzi, who took up arms to defend the country, and organized a national salvation group of more than a hundred people, repeatedly attacking Japanese soldiers and killing or wounding more than seventy people. It was only because there were also Little White Dragon and Old North Wind fighting against the enemy at the same time that the little hero's name could not spread far and wide. However, from then on, many comrades joined the little hero. In less than a year, the little hero had been elected as the commander-in-chief of the Anti-Japanese Iron Blood Army. He had not yet reached the age of fourteen.</p>
<p>Since the little hero took it as his mission to destroy his family to buy planes and fight the enemy, when the January 28th National Crisis was critical, he was in Guandong, and once led a team to attack the enemy forces, capturing more than a hundred guns, two thousand rounds of ammunition, 450 bags of noodles, and countless supplies. Recently, he led his team to join the Ninth Brigade Commander Cui Yunwu, who sighed at his youth and ambition and awarded him the position of regimental commander. The entire army welcomed this fifteen-year-old anti-Japanese little hero, Regiment Commander Wang. These are all summaries of the records in the Hong Kong newspapers. The war in Guandong is in full swing, but I don't know how the battle is going for Regiment Commander Wang under the command of Cui Yunwu, the Ninth Brigade Commander of the Army Cavalry? I hope that the hero's name will be gloriously recorded in the war reports from time to time, so that the faces of children all over the country will be shining with golden light.</p>
<h3>Rainy Street</h3>
<p>— Ren Ying</p>
<p>The rain is falling gently. I am treading on this muddy street, pacing this long journey. In the area of Edward Road, where small inns stand in rows, there are products of Chinese spiritual civilization. The wandering fortune tellers (?) rely on the iron railings to prey on the working class pedestrians. On weekdays, a group of sallow-faced people often surround the outside of the iron railings, holding boundless sympathy and trust in the fortune tellers' rambling theories. Therefore, these wanderers in the city of hibiscus are also extracting a portion of their livelihood from the sweat and blood of the working class. Today, because the road is shrouded in gray smoke and rain, the pedestrians have dispersed. They probably feel extremely disappointed with this ethereal rain!</p>
<p>The time is only four o'clock, but passing through the vegetable market street, the retailers of flesh are already standing in the rainy street. They open their dull pupils, wanting to swallow the lonely pedestrians one by one.</p>
<p>The beggars are still wearing crooked felt hats and tattered burlap sacks, pestering everyone who is hurrying along. Their sick-man style, the cheeks consumed by red pills, will not gain people's pity, especially in the spring rain-filled air.</p>
<p>The children selling evening newspapers shout themselves hoarse, wandering around the rainy street. They shout out alarming slogans, wanting to attract more buyers. In this ten-mile foreign concession metropolis, only he decorates the severity of the national crisis.</p>
<p>I am waiting under the eaves of the shop for a streetcar to my destination. A heavy vehicle, full of passengers, finally comes winding along. The rotation of the wheels splashes dirty mud. This is a symbol of the motherland's future. Is this wheel, burdened with a solemn mission, heading towards decline, or is it heading towards a bright future?</p>
<h3>Urban Jottings</h3>
<p>— Guo Lanxun</p>
<p>Saturday night is the romantic night of the city. On this night, those who have been restrained by work seek a hearty gathering, because tomorrow is Sunday, without worries about time. Therefore, Saturday night becomes a romantic night in the city.</p>
<p>The previous Saturday night, I felt very lonely in my small building, so I went from Rue Sainte-Marie to North Sichuan Road to see Zhang Gong, who had been on North Sichuan Road for twelve years. We talked for a moment, and we decided to go to a coffee shop to spend this Saturday night.</p>
<p>Diagonally across from Thompsons is the newly opened "Sunlight." Going north from "Sunlight" through an alley is the "Global Coffee Shop." Zhang Gong is very burly and already in his thirties, but still in good spirits. After going upstairs, we sat in a room, and a waitress came out to serve us. Her name was originally Xiao Maotou, but because many Italian soldiers couldn't pronounce this name, they called her Xiaomeng. Everyone called her Xiaomeng, and no one heard the name Xiao Maotou anymore. Her Italian was very good, and she had several Italian soldiers as acquaintances.</p>
<p>We ordered two cups of coffee and drank them in the dim light. The music from the "Moon Palace" to the south, "Starlight" across the street, and "Dahua" to the north, three dance halls, faintly wafted over, like scattered melodies from a distant, celestial city with twelve balustrades.</p>
<p>Later, another amiable waitress came over, named Ailian. She spoke and laughed nonsensically. She didn't know anything. She had no soul. All she saw was that people liked her and would give her money, and she would exchange it for what they wanted. Laughing this year and laughing next year, she didn't think about anything else.</p>
<p>I also like drinking coffee very much. Sometimes I sit alone in a corner of the coffee shop, with a cup of coffee in front of me, quietly watching the merrymaking of many other people. It's a special kind of feeling that others don't understand. It's just like when we gather on the second floor of the New Asia, we like to sit at a table by the stairs, watching the comings and goings of customers, men and women, old and young, Chinese and foreigners, and like watching the audience leave the Shanghai Grand Theatre.</p>
<p>At this time, another guest came to the next room, and Xiaomeng went to serve them. After a moment, we heard Xiaomeng say to the guest: "What about the watch you promised me the day before yesterday? You haven't brought it today?" We didn't hear what the guest said. After a burst of laughter, Xiaomeng came out and shouted to the counter for two orders of chicken curry rice.</p>
<p>I chatted with Zhang Gong about some small talk. Seeing that it was already twelve o'clock, we paid the bill and came out. As we reached the stairs, we heard another burst of laughter from Xiaomeng. Stepping onto North Sichuan Road, amidst a scene of amorous feelings and intoxicating spring night, it seemed that we were no longer stepping on our troubled homeland.</p>
<h3>Rose Thorns</h3>
<p>— Zui Zhu</p>
<p>On the front of the black slate hanging at the entrance of the classroom is "Welcome Criticism," and on the back is "No Visitors Allowed."</p>
<p>The motto hanging in the editor's office is "This is Freedom" on the front, and "Don't Discuss National Affairs" on the back.</p>
<p>Opening the door to invite thieves, offering everything with folded hands,</p>
<p>This beautiful virtue of yielding and conceding is still the legacy of our ancestors, Emperors Yao and Shun, four thousand years ago, a republic of perfect governance and the epitome of civilization. Now, we, these virtuous children and grandchildren, are putting it into practice. How can we not look down on all nations, be unique for thousands of years, and earn a compliment from others: "The magnanimity of a great nation is simply beyond the reach of island barbarians!" Ha!</p>
<h3>The Double-Gun General</h3>
<p>According to reports: The fugitive general Tang Yulin once used opium as military pay, which can be described as unprecedented. Then, all of his subordinates must be hermits, without a doubt. Using hermits as soldiers can truly be called a "gentleman's army." These gentlemen soldiers use opium pipes on the couch and rifles in the trenches. With both guns blazing, how brave, how brave! No wonder they are called the "Double-Gun General." But I don't know how this Double-Gun General compares to Dong Ping, the Double-Gun General of the 108 heroes in the Hall of Loyalty and Righteousness of Liangshan Marsh?</p>

<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Episode 2</p>
<p>A humble room gains a fragrant neighbor, secretly admiring a hale old man; the Quan family chooses a good match, bitterly denouncing a poor girl.</p>
<p>The next morning, after the Jiang family got up, they heard all sorts of noises in the backyard. The old gentleman had probably gotten up early. She stood by the courtyard gate, stretching her head to look inside. She saw the old gentleman wearing a short cotton jacket, practicing boxing in the courtyard. She smiled and said, "Old gentleman, your health is really good. You get up so early and practice boxing in the courtyard." Old Zhao clasped his fists and bowed twice, saying, "I'm used to practicing. If I don't practice for a day, I feel uncomfortable." The Jiang family said with a smile, "Thank you so much for sending those white flour馒头 last night." Old Zhao said, "It's nothing. Because that Shandong 馒头 was newly acquired yesterday, brought out from the city. I thought that this place in Haidian might not be able to buy it, so I sent some for you to try. I heard from errand boy Lao Wang that you and your mother are constantly bent over in the house all day, doing work. You're truly diligent, and I like people like that. A person with nothing to do, constantly fussing about flowers and makeup, saying how handsome and beautiful they are, only eating and not working, that's a great useless person. The world wouldn't miss them if they were gone, one less wouldn't make a difference." The Jiang family laughed, "Old gentleman is an old-fashioned person, looking up to us. Actually, my mother and I have no choice. If we had a little bit of a way to earn a living, we wouldn't be suffering our ten fingers like this." Old Zhao stroked his beard, nodded, and said, "Good! As soon as I entered the door and saw you and your mother, I knew you were good neighbors. Old lady, the morning cold is heavy when you get up. Come to my house and have a cup of hot tea." The Jiang family smiled, "I'm all disheveled, you're laughing at me. I'll come in a little while." The Jiang family returned to the house, boiled water, washed her face, and said to Guizhi, "This old gentleman is really a good person. Let's take a look at his house." Guizhi was, after all, a young girl, and she still couldn't shake off a bit of a child's psychology. Ever since this neighbor moved in, she had really wanted to see what other people's families were like. But she was afraid of offending Gan Er, so she didn't feel comfortable going. Now that her mother was going, she thought it didn't matter if she went with her, and she said with a smile, "Okay, I'll go see it with you." Saying these words, she found the small comb in the drawer, combed her hair for a while, tugged at her clothes, and said with a smile, "Let's go together." So she followed behind her mother, all the way to Old Zhao's house. The central room was also arranged like a parlor, with a hanging portrait of Guan Yu with a red face above, and a pair of large-character couplets on both sides, the characters written big and thick. On the left hung four screen panels with characters on them, each character framed in a red grid. On the right wall hung four colorful paintings of foreigners in battle. (16)</p>
<p>Children's Paradise</p>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<h3>Intelligence and Dim Eyes</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, in this world, any kind of thing, when looked at with ordinary dim eyes, has no interest. But when looked at with intelligent, discerning eyes, great inventions can be made. For example, when Newton saw an apple fall to the ground, he discovered the principle of gravity. Galileo (an Italian) saw a lamp swinging and discovered the principle of the pendulum. (He discovered the sunspot theory.) However, for millions of years, countless people have seen apples fall, hundreds of millions of people. These hundreds of millions of people, because they all had muddle-headed eyes, could not discover anything. Why is that? It's because even the smallest things contain profound principles in the universe. Those who pay attention can understand them at first sight. By adding another step of thinking to understanding, they become great inventors. This is not only true for scientific inventions and discoveries. From the ancient times of human cave dwellings to the present day, it has taken tens of thousands of years of human discerning eyes and consideration to reach today's civilization. Consider how ants, riding on floating leaves in the water, thought of building ships. See how spiders climb vines to build webs, and think of suspension bridges. From wooden boats, we have progressed to iron ships, from sailing ships to steamships, from suspension bridges to iron bridges. In the past, people said that humans couldn't fly in the air, but today, that dream has become a reality. The invention of the airplane shattered the mystery of the flying man in the past. All kinds of inventions and improvements rely on the power of human intelligent and discerning eyes. Therefore, you, gentlemen, can develop our intelligent apertures from anything that catches your eye at any time and in any place.</p>
<h3>Numerical Games Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>The owner of a certain ranch, mixing cattle, sheep, and horses, bought a hundred of them for four thousand yuan. Each cow cost four hundred yuan, each donkey or horse cost one hundred and twenty yuan, and each sheep cost twenty yuan. Question: How many cows, how many sheep, and how many donkeys/horses did this person buy of the hundred?</p>
<p>(Answer) One cow/horse, one donkey/horse, ninety-four sheep.</p>
<p>(Question) In the picture above, how many squares are there? Please count carefully.</p>
<p>(Answer) Twenty-two.</p>
<p>(Question) According to the arrangement of the seven circles in the picture above (1), in which the rows are three circles and the columns are five circles, what is a way to arrange them so that there are five circles in both the rows and the columns?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is to overlap two circles on top of the circle in the center (add the circles on the left and right sides to the circle in the center), transforming it into the appearance of picture (2).</p>
<h3>Shaking Head</h3>
<p>When a mother bird feeds her chicks, if the chick closes its mouth and shakes its head from side to side, it means that the chick's stomach is full and it doesn't want to eat. There are also times when a chick is hungry, but even if it opens its mouth, because the food being fed is disliked or dirty, it will also shake its head and close its mouth. Children are also like this. When a mother uses chopsticks to bring food to a baby's mouth, if the baby's stomach is full and it doesn't want to eat, it will definitely close its mouth and shake its head. Therefore, as babies gradually grow up, whenever they encounter something they (don't want) or (don't need), they use shaking their heads to indicate, and it becomes a habit.</p>
<h3>Dogs Chasing Cars</h3>
<p>When dogs are wild, they crouch in their dens, watching for anything edible to walk by. If they see deer, mountain goats, or other animals, they will definitely suddenly chase out of the den. Sometimes, if an animal larger than themselves runs past their den, the dog, thinking that it is afraid of them and is running away, will chase after it desperately. Therefore, when a car speeds past, they chase after it without regard for anything. The reason why dog racing tracks use electric rabbits to lure dogs to run is because the dog sees the rabbit, which fits its appetite perfectly, and all want to eat it to their heart's content, so they desperately chase forward.</p>

<h3>The Interest Rate on Foreign Silver is Suddenly Reduced by Three Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday, and the bank was closed for its usual afternoon holiday, so the market atmosphere was calm. The interest rates on the two types of foreign silver were the same in the morning and afternoon markets, both being three points, which was three points less than the previous day. The commission fee was increased by four or five points. The amount of exchange drafts issued was 170,000 in the morning market and 457,000 in the afternoon market. The amount of checks was 235,000 in the morning market and 160,000 in the afternoon market. The amount of discounted bills traded was over 2 million in foreign currency and over 4 million in silver. The amount of bank collections was limited. Because it was Saturday afternoon, there was no time to investigate in detail, so it is omitted. The amount of foreign silver public notes collected by money shops was over 6.5 million, and the amount of silver public notes collected was over 17 million. The amount traded by small money shops was over 400,000. The Jiangnan small foreign currency for subsidiary coins was 6 qian, 1 fen, 8 li, 2 hao and a half in the morning market, and the same price in the afternoon market. The transactions were only 4,000 jiao in the morning market. The Guangdong small foreign currency was 5 qian, 7 fen, 9 li and a half in the morning market, and 5 qian, 7 fen, 9 li and 7 hao in the afternoon market.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<h3>No Significant Fluctuations in Weekend Public Bonds</h3>
<p>It is Expected That There Will Be a Wave Next Week</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the China Merchants Securities Exchange, the public bond market was relatively stable. The northern gang has stopped selling, and transactions have become much quieter due to the Saturday relationship. The atmosphere in the market was lax, so the market price changes were also very slight. The opening in the morning was extremely stable, with few buys and sells. No. 47 was sold off slightly, and retail investors took it in slightly. The salt tax was relatively firm. The front row was stable before the mid-session. There was demand for various treasury bonds with a maturity of 20 years, and the market was considered flat but firm with a slight increase of three or four jiao. In the afternoon, the northern gang took in slightly, and there were fewer sellers, so they all raised the price by three or four jiao. The future salt tax was slightly lower due to the sale of No. 14. The trading became even clearer at the close, and it was getting more and more stable, with only the future salt tax rising slightly by two jiao and five fen. The market was extremely mediocre, and the result was a slight increase of one or two jiao to five jiao or more. The difference in surface values also reached one yuan. Both the long and short sides were mostly watching. Next week is the last week of trading for this month, and there will inevitably be larger waves, because the amount of stock is still large, there should still be some competition. The total transaction volume was 5,052,000 yuan in total, of which 2,000 yuan was in cash, and only the salt tax had a turnover of more than 1 million in futures, the unified tax was more than 900,000, the demobilization was 870,000, the 27th edition was more than 700,000, the 20th volume was more than 500,000, the 19th charity was more than 400,000, the 19th tariff was only 180,000, the dispersal was more than 200,000, and the Jin Chang Zheng 6.18 tariff was only 90,000 yuan in total.</p>
<h3>New York Stocks Fall Back One to Two Dollars</h3>
<p>Sinfeng Foreign Firm reports that on Friday the 17th, the New York stock market underwent a severe test. Bullish investors rushed to take profits, and most stocks fell by one to two dollars. Although the market attempted to rally and rebounded several times, it gradually weakened before the close. Simultaneously, due to general disappointment with agricultural legislation, bullish investors liquidated positions, and commodities also declined. The total trading volume for the day was 1.73 million shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the market prices of several stable stocks are listed below:</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks 60.73 Down 2.22</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<h3>Current Sales Feel Stagnant</h3>
<h3>Yarn Futures Continue to Show Soft Conditions</h3>
<p>The yarn market is generally sluggish and weak. Because current yarn dealers are inactive, morale is extremely low, and prices should decline. However, raw cotton prices are quite high, causing the yarn market to be slightly tight due to their close relationship. Currently, the market is showing strong resistance to falling, fundamentally relying on consumption for support.</p>
<p>People's Standard Falls: At the opening of the People's Standard market, due to the decline in imported cotton, sentiment was weak. Also, Xinchang liquidated 2,000 bales, with prices for various months falling by two, three, or four qian. In the afternoon, it was reported that actual sales were not high, and the market atmosphere remained dull, with prices for various months fluctuating by one qian. The total trading volume for the day was 20,100 bales. Upon investigation, Xinchang sold 2,000 bales, Yuande 700 bales, Changfeng 1,600 bales, Chongan 700 bales, and Yuantai 650 bales. Shenchang bought 750 bales, Changfeng 400 bales, Taichang 700 bales, Yichang 800 bales, Hengchang 450 bales, and Dafeng 500 bales. The closing prices are as follows: People's Standard closing price fluctuations and outstanding accounts: June 1417 down 3, 318,250; March 1382 down 3, 213,507; July 1427, 424,650; April 1393, 245,008; August 1441, 110,400; May 1404, 441,200. Total: 1,723,000.</p>
<p>Spot Transactions are Even More Sparse: Spot yarn sales are sluggish. According to statistics, all dealers purchased only 380 bales for the day, with prices falling by 2.5 qian. The purchase amounts for each dealer are as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan 80, Wuhu 5, Changsha 30, Anqing 2</p>
<p>Guangdong 80, Mainland 163, Fellow Traders 10, Shantou 10</p>
<h3>Cotton Futures Bulls Still Show Strong Intentions</h3>
<p>Although American Cotton Falls, Futures Prices Rise Again: Although American cotton suddenly declined, the local cotton market was not greatly affected because silver prices fell, gold prices rose, and exchange rates were tight, making silver-based calculations less favorable. Bullish investors still showed strong intentions, and some continued to buy to go long. However, the yarn market is weak, and factory demand remains sluggish.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Shows Slight Discrepancies: At the opening of the Zheng Standard market, sentiment softened due to the sharp decline in American cotton. However, gold prices were high, with prices for various months falling by 0.5 to 1.5 qian. In the afternoon, market conditions stabilized, with prices for various months fluctuating by 0.5 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 31,300 dan. Upon investigation, Shenji sold 1,700 dan, Yichang 800 dan, Chongan 800 dan, Ruiyuan 1,300 dan, Changfeng 1,600 dan, Yuchang 1,600 dan, and Xiesheng 1,100 dan. Yuanxingchang bought 1,400 dan, Gengfeng 1,500 dan, Tongxing 5,300 dan, Hengchang 1,000 dan, and Hengde 800 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard closing price fluctuations and outstanding accounts: June 3235 down 10, 85,000; March 3155 up 5, 55,000; July 3250, 158,440; April 3175 down 158,670; August 3280, 48,500; May 3210, 158,880. Total: 448,400.</p>
<p>Factory Demand is Stagnant: Spot cotton business remains sluggish. Sources include Yao flower 1,600 bales.</p>
<p>Shaanxi flower 3125 Yong'an Factory imported 200 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory, and American cotton sales were strong.</p>
<h3>Decline of More Than Thirty Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was sold off due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and profit-taking by bullish investors, resulting in a decline. Futures fell by thirty to thirty-six points, and spot prices fell by thirty points. British cotton futures fell by three or four points, and spot prices rose by one point. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by two points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases and short-covering by European exporters, but later declined as Liverpool did not follow the decline in American cotton. Bengale and White Rose fell by 0.75, while Robium Lacha fell by 0.5. Original telegram records are on the left (telegram of the 17th).</p>

<h3>American Cotton Shows Potential for a Booming Market</h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 17th reports on the cotton market for the week. Yesterday, the cotton exchange reopened, and trading was active, with values rising sharply, greatly improving sentiment. There has been some shift in views regarding inflation, but the administrative leaders' meeting in Washington due to the banking crisis and President Roosevelt's economic proposals show a revival of confidence. Most cotton merchants believe the tide has turned. In general, business in various sectors has improved. However, based on the statistical position of raw cotton, some believe that cotton prices are too high and may not be sustainable. Therefore, they advocate caution and await further developments in the future. At the same time, everyone is focusing on the farm relief bill, which proposes a federal plan for leasing surplus land to achieve production reduction and domestic distribution methods. This bill will grant broad powers to the Secretary of Agriculture and is considered an emergency measure to seek rapid progress. It has already been submitted to Congress by President Roosevelt. The weekend statistics are appended below (units of 1,000 bales):</p>

<h3>Grain</h3>
<h3>Hexia Rice Accumulates, Prices Fall by Ten to Twenty Cents</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's sources numbered forty to fifty, with the arrival of rice from Pujiang continuing to be strong, leading to gradual accumulation. With city and rural stores and stomachs competing to handle purchases, the situation eased, and the market softened. Contracted purchases exceeded 1,000 shi, but selection was very strict, with only high-quality thin rice being chosen. As a result, high-quality thin rice from the Qingjiao gang, etc., remained firm, while middle-grade rice weakened. Rice from the Jiaoshi, Sutong gang, and Nangang Chang gang, etc., also fell slightly. Dujian and Yangjian rice were able to hold their prices due to scarcity of goods, but Bianlingyuan rice was sluggish, with prices falling by ten to twenty cents.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday's sources from various Hexia gangs numbered thirty-eight to thirty-nine. In the market, Baijing rice was selling cleverly and selectively, with market prices falling by about ten cents. Thin Jing early rice sources were not strong, and retail sales were acceptable, with thin rice in the market falling slightly by about ten cents and early rice showing a slight weakening trend. Yangjian rice arrived in large quantities, and sales were stagnant, with prices falling by ten to twenty cents. Dujian and Baijian rice showed a weakening trend. Kejian was scarce, with transactions limited. Yinyuan arrivals were few, and sales were limited, with market prices remaining firm. Baiyuan rice also showed a weakening trend.</p>
<h3>Price Fluctuations of Flour Depend on Actual Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market generally showed a flat and weak trend. Because the quoted prices of foreign wheat from Chicago fell slightly by ten to twenty cents and from Canada fell by nine cents, market sentiment was weak after the opening, falling by five to 7.5 li compared to the previous day. (Only the Yingkou gang purchased over 10,000 jin for recent actual sales. However, because both parties largely had no intention to trade, each sector remained cold. This situation is due to sluggish actual sales and the halt of all out-of-town dealers. Approaching the afternoon opening, this month's prices generally hovered. Small factories slightly advanced, and Henan dealers returned to selling, resulting in a slight turn for the better. However, factories continuously submitted applications for future dates, but the number of recipients was small, and selling was not easy. Observing the rise and fall after this, it seems that it has little relationship with foreign quotations. The most important thing is to see how actual sales are.) As a result, this month's prices were lower than the previous month's by five li, April's by one fen, May and June's by 7.5 li, July's by one fen, and August's by 7.5 li.</p>
<h3>Trading in Wheat Futures Was Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market generally showed a flat and weak trend in the morning and afternoon openings. Because the quoted prices of foreign wheat from Chicago fell slightly by ten to twenty cents and from Canada fell by nine cents, the market mood has become weak. Out-of-town dealers have been silent for a long time, and local dealers have been observing. Only local brokers slightly hedged. No factories have made any deals, lacking momentum. The market outlook will follow the rise and fall of the flour market. As a result, this month's prices were lower than the previous day's by two fen, April's by 2.5 fen. May was not opened. June opened at 3 taels 1 qian 9 fen, July was lower by two fen, and August was lower by two fen.</p>
<h3>Sand Yellow and Small Black Soybeans Have Large Inventories and Prices Ease</h3>
<p>Recently, among the types of soybeans, Xiaodu soybeans and sand yellow soybeans have had relatively high turnover. However, because inventories are not low, sellers intend to sell, so the purchase intentions of Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Taizhou, the local area, and Xiamen are able to connect. However, the market situation is still generally sluggish. Huoche soybeans rely on exclusive purchases by factories, with not much trading by other dealers. Although current arrivals and inventories are both rare, sales are sluggish, so the market atmosphere appears calm.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<h3>Turpentine Has a Potential Turning Point</h3>
<p>Falling Trend Calms, Wholesale Sales Begin</p>
<p>Turpentine prices first rose sharply and then fell sharply, inevitably causing ups and downs in the market. The previous rise was caused by market sentiment, showing a soaring trend. Once it encountered a setback, it turned into a rapid decline, differing greatly from the situation before the rise. This was because it was not driven by genuine sales in the market, making it vulnerable to setbacks. It is evident that those who engage in this business lack accurate vision and merely follow the crowd. Currently, the market has stabilized, and candle makers are now using it for summer demand. Therefore, wholesale sales seem to be showing some activity. Han Turpentine has fallen to 15 taels, Ping Turpentine to 14 taels 5 qian, and Qianxing Cheng Turpentine to 14 taels 4 qian. There are signs of turning from stability. Local dealers have extremely limited inventories, and sales are about to begin, so everyone is paying attention to stocking up. Recently, there have been many purchases in Hankou, mostly high-quality goods, preparing for the summer demand of candle shops. Since soap factories have not made purchases, no one dares to stock up on lower-grade goods. Zhe Turpentine also has a firm trend because sellers do not want further declines, and dealers are willing to hold firm. Only Julan Oil sells for 21.34 yuan, with Neiping at 26.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Coarse Sand White Sugar Rises by Five Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a tightening trend due to the rise in futures prices and the stabilization of the Dutch exchange rate. The association set the price for 24 Coarse Sand White Sugar at 14 taels 9 qian 5 fen, up by five fen compared to the previous day. However, trading was limited. 20 Medium Sand White was unchanged at 14 taels 4 qian. 89 Dutch Red was 11 taels 56 qian, with Qing sugar only seeing scattered transactions. The formal price for Tizhuang Qing was 9 taels 03 fen, Huangpu Qing 8 taels 8 qian 3 fen, Longgang Qing 8 taels 4 qian 3 fen, and Bannan Qing 8 taels 6 qian 3 fen. Jianbing showed a slight easing trend. Yuchun White Ice was opened sparsely, with each block priced at 12 taels 2 qian, down by one qian compared to the previous day. Zhichi also fell slightly by one qian, with several hundred bags opened.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>New Information on Woolen Cloth Market Conditions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the woolen cloth trend was good, with sales being smooth. However, the market showed signs of softening due to the influx of new goods. The recent trends of various goods are summarized below: Walter Wool, solid colors, had the widest sales, with buyers actively purchasing common yellow, cyan, black, and gray. The newly arrived herringbone patterns and the previously popular plaid Walter Wool were also selling quickly. Walter Wool with floral patterns for suits was extremely scarce. Tailors were reselling cuts for 11 to 12 yuan per yard.</p>
<p>Serge with floral patterns had weak sales and high prices. Various colors such as New Red, Yellow, and Yuan Miscellaneous Colors were selling several qian per yard cheaper than other regular Yuan Miscellaneous Colors. Regular solid-colored Serge had higher sales than any other Serge. 2 tael 23 qian material was even more popular. Medium-thick Serge was currently in demand and selling well. Tianyou 1000 was selling for 3 taels 5 qian 5 fen, Dongfang 3008 for 3 taels 3 qian 7 fen 5 fen, and Bao Ke Dehua Li for 4 taels 2 qian 5 fen.</p>
<p>Flannel was also selling well, with both striped and solid colors having good sales. The top grade was selling for 4 taels 7 qian 5 fen, ordinary goods for 3 taels 56 qian, and second-grade goods for 2 taels 67 qian. Lower-grade goods, such as Yixing kuojiao, were only around 2 taels. Regular market sales were wider. White was scarce and in demand.</p>

<h3>Going Head-On</h3>
<p>— He Jiawo</p>
<p>The Chinese Modern Bible—The Going Head-On Sutra says: (We must go head-on to catch up, do not follow behind). It is said: Following behind is common in chasing history. It is usually irrelevant whether one is chasing head-on. However, the Bible will never be wrong, much less incomprehensible, especially in these abnormal times. So catching up specifically says "going head-on," and following behind is said to be impossible! The current popular saying is: (Wherever the Japanese army goes, resistance follows). As for whether lost territory will be recovered, well, of course (detailed plans are unknown, as one is not a military expert). That's right, (wherever the Japanese army goes, resistance follows)—isn't this going head-on to catch up! As soon as the Japanese army arrives, meet them head-on: When the Japanese army arrived in Shenyang, meet them head-on to catch up to Beiping; when the Japanese army arrived in Zhabei, meet them head-on to catch up to Zhenru; when the Japanese army arrived at Shanhaiguan, meet them head-on to catch up to Tanggu; when the Japanese army arrived in Chengde, meet them head-on to catch up to Gubeikou... In the past, there was the temporary capital of Luoyang, now there is the auxiliary capital of Xi'an, and in the future there will be (the birthplace of the Han people) Kunlun Mountain—the Western Paradise. As for recovering lost territory, even non-military experts know that the scripture says (do not follow behind). As proven by the past Shanghai battles, whenever the Japanese army retreated to the concessions, they would (strictly order their troops not to step into the concessions). Thus, the so-called going head-on to catch up and not following behind are not only found in the classics but also proven truths. End of Chapter One.</p>
<p>The Sutra also says: Going head-on and not following behind also have a second profound meaning—</p>
<p>A news report on the actual situation in Rehe said that the volunteer armies were extremely brave, considering disrupting and killing Japanese soldiers an exciting thing. However, after the announcement of Zhang Zuoxiang receiving the volunteer armies, Zhang Zuoxiang neither went to comfort them in person, nor did the Rehe government continue to supply gasoline to the volunteer armies, and the transportation was interrupted. The volunteer armies were mostly disappointed, and some even thought that it was meaningless to render service to Zhang Zuoxiang. (After the Japanese army reached Lingyuan, Zhang Zuoxiang was already gone. Upon hearing the news, we fled, and the Rehe government impounded the cars that were transporting goods, which has become a witnessed fact. As evidenced by the fact that the Japanese army never sent planes to bomb Chengde, it can be seen that Chengde was in fact a compromised abandonment), (as discussed by Mr. Zhang Huichong at a Shanghai Northeast Refugee Relief Association meeting). Although, according to Mr. Zhang Huichong, (the most famous volunteer army leaders did not have the same loyalty and courage as we imagined), the soldiers of the volunteer army were indeed extremely brave common people. Precisely because these common people did not understand the Bible, they did not know the head-on strategy. Thus, the common people themselves would naturally encounter head-on resistance: After the Rehe government abandoned Chengde, the Beiping Military Commission Branch ordered (to defend Gubeikou firmly, and if volunteer armies tried to enter, they would be shot at). This means that my (resistance) only follows wherever the Japanese army goes. If you want to resist in a different way, I will resist you. Besides, my retreat was arranged in advance. Since you are unwilling to compromise, then you are only (not allowed to follow behind), and will be (met head-on) on Mount Liang. End of Chapter Two.</p>
<p>Poem: The panicked armies, rush head-on, (scoffing) commoners, do not follow behind! A verse.</p>
<h3>A Hu</h3>
<p>— Qiu Peng</p>
<p>Raising his hoe, striking into the loose soil, he, A Hu, suddenly raised his head and saw a sedan chair flying along the path by the pond. Recognizing that the occupant was Gui Bao, he quickly put on a respectful smile and greeted him: "Third Master is back?"</p>
<p>But that person didn't even glance at him directly and passed by!</p>
<p>The March sun shone on A Hu's back, making him feel uncomfortably hot. He leaned on the hoe handle to rest for a while. Suddenly, he remembered his dead father's words: "We are servants, and they are masters. How can you go against them?" More than ten years of fragmented memories came back to his mind along with those words:</p>
<p>At that time, he was only eleven years old. His father worked as a long-term laborer at the only big landlord, Master Shu Fu, in the village. His mother knitted straw sandals and spun yarn for people at home. He himself, along with dozens of naughty children in the village, studied at the Ni Family Ancestral Hall under a red-nosed teacher. That was a small school run with public funds from the ancestral hall. Villagers didn't need to pay to study, so almost all of the students there were children from poor families, except for a few, such as Gui Bao, who was the third grandson of Master Shu Fu. He was one of the few exceptions!</p>
<p>Gui Bao and A Hu were in the same grade. He was small and thin, just like a model of Master Shu Fu. A Hu was tall, strong, and smart, so A Hu was the king in the school. Not only the whole school of students, but even the red-nosed teacher couldn't do anything to him. He openly accepted bribes of candy from a group of children, writing characters and composing essays for them. However, they didn't get along well with Gui Bao. Gui Bao was the only object of hostility and ridicule by this group of children. Often, they composed a ballad about the scandalous affair of Master Shu Fu stealing his eldest daughter-in-law and giving birth to Gui Bao. A Hu would lead the others, one, two, three, and everyone would surround Gui Bao and sing: "Turtle, turtle, roasted with rice straw! The old man steals ash, what did he steal? Stole a little turtle, Gui Bao!" Gui Bao would always go home crying, but many children would jump and laugh.</p>
<p>But when A Hu returned home in the evening, he would be beaten by his father. His father always sternly warned him: "You little devil! If you bully Gui Bao again, I'll beat you to death. We are servants, and they are masters. How can you go against them?" A Hu never understood why his father had to help others like that.</p>
<p>Now, his father was dead. A Hu had grown up. He continued to be a servant for others, while Gui Bao had graduated from some university and become an official outside. A Hu finally understood the different realms of what his father called servants and masters. He remembered the abuse he had suffered from his masters over the years, and Gui Bao's arrogant attitude just now. His father's words stirred up a wave of anger in his heart again.</p>
<p>"Damn it, are we just going to be servants for others for the rest of our lives?" He threw down his hoe!</p>
<h3>Casual Notes from the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Chen Zuiyun</p>
<p>The Old Story of Capturing Bandits</p>
<p>A friend who works in the water police force visited me while on official business. After talking about what had happened since we last met, I asked him: "There are many robbery cases everywhere now. Seeing the news reports, the robberies always involve hundreds or dozens of people. Why is it that when they are solved, it's always just one or two people?" That friend smiled, shook his head, and said frankly: "Those one or two people who are caught are not real robbers. They are pigs raised by the robbers!"</p>
<p>I asked in surprise: "What do you mean by pigs raised by the robbers?"</p>
<p>He said: "After a robbery occurs in an area, the robbers flee in all directions. The higher authorities routinely send official documents urging a thorough investigation to solve the case. Otherwise, there will be punishment. The official documents come down one after another, making it very difficult. The robbers also know about this difficult situation, and they become uneasy. So they find two or three low-level thugs who usually receive stipends but have never done any real work, and order them to take two broken guns and row a boat to a certain place. At the same time, they arrange to report to the water police that on a certain day and time, there will be a bandit boat in a certain place, which is the wanted criminal who committed a certain robbery. So, they are caught easily, sacrificing these two (pigs), and everyone is at peace."</p>
<p>I exclaimed: "So that's how it is!" He said: "This is the old story of history. It is not surprising at all. China's politics are entirely about (reporting official business). Whether it is to superiors or subordinates, having a report to account for something is enough. If you talk about being realistic, you are truly an amateur!"</p>

<h3>Crossroads of Era and Love</h3>
<p>— Zhang Guanping</p>
<p>After Mr. Zhu spoke, he sighed again. Hearing Mr. Zhu sigh so deeply and seeing him speak in such a mysterious manner, Haiquan was completely baffled. He didn't reply for a moment, only showing a questioning expression towards Mr. Zhu. (The factions among the students at school are really making it impossible for us professors to cope. I wish I could please my brother, but that would upset my sister-in-law...) Mr. Zhu's way of speaking was making Haiquan anxious to death. He thought, why couldn't Mr. Zhu just give a report, straightforwardly explaining the whole situation?</p>
<p>(Teaching English shouldn't be considered top-notch, but it's not bad, right?)</p>
<p>(Mr. Zhu, you teach English very well. However, you shouldn't take on literary or scientific subjects. Because language and the arts are two different paths. The students didn't say your English was bad, they just said you're a complete layman when it comes to literature.) ( )</p>
<p>Zhu Wei stroked his beard on his chin, nodding his head reluctantly. This clearly indicated that he couldn't accept Haiquan's advice, but he also didn't want to directly refute Haiquan's words.</p>
<p>(That's not entirely true. )</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu continued to stroke his beard, nodding slightly.</p>
<p>( In fact, this is an excuse used by a group of left-wing students from the S Society. They say I'm reactionary!)</p>
<p>When Mr. Zhu said the word "reactionary," his voice was particularly loud, and the sound of the word "reactionary" was especially drawn out.</p>
<p>(If that's true, it's really absurd to arbitrarily accuse people of being reactionary.)</p>
<p>(What you say is indeed fair!)</p>
<p>This time, Mr. Zhu seemed to laugh happily and nodded frequently, expressing his agreement with Haiquan's words.</p>
<p>(You must help me, Mr. Lin. I will definitely have a chance to repay you in the future.)</p>
<p>(Mr. Zhu, you're too polite, but how do you want me to help?)</p>
<p>(First, help me find out from them, those members of the S Society, whether they are determined to drive me away, and whether there's any room for maneuver. Second, you need to smooth things over with them, saying that Zhu Wei is a good person after all, and has no prejudice in politics, being able to lean left or right.)</p>
<h3>Parisian Musings</h3>
<p>— Sent from Paris by Xiao Shijun</p>
<p>(5) Anecdotes of Bergson and his Theories on Drama</p>
<p>We know that the French extreme leftist Jean Jaurès was a strong advocate for pacifism before the outbreak of the European War. As a result, he was shot, and his life can be said to have been lost for his consistent principles. He was a classmate of Bergson's at the École Normale Supérieure. In 1928, when Bergson received the Nobel Prize, a famous Parisian literary weekly published a special issue praising Bergson. Lévy-Bruhl published a short piece that recounted an anecdote about Bergson and Jaurès as classmates at the École Normale Supérieure. At that time, both of them had excellent grades in school and were fond of debate, which attracted the attention of their classmates. Jaurès was a short, stout man, and when he spoke, he was eloquent, with a southern French accent. Because his voice was loud, the whole school could hear him. Bergson was relatively thin and had a very gentle manner. When Jaurès poured out his words like a great river, Bergson could use concise and to-the-point language to argue against him, which the audience found very interesting. Therefore, as soon as they started debating, many people would gather around them. But they were very good friends. They both loved reading Homer, Virgil, Hugo, and the works of contemporary poets. They sometimes went to the Louvre together to see various works of art.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that Bergson, as a philosopher, received the Nobel Prize in Literature because he had a thorough understanding of literature and art. Here is an excerpt from his writing on drama to show this: He said, "The reality that drama explores and clearly exposes to us is often something that we have to try our best to hide in our actual lives due to considerations of interests. All poetry is nothing but an expression of our mental state, and our most intense and violent mental state is produced when people come into contact with each other, like the flash of light emitted when positive and negative electrodes come into contact. When people come into contact with each other, they may produce strong attraction or strong repulsion. When they completely lose balance, the so-called 'Passion' of spiritual electricity is produced. If people rely entirely on innate emotional impulses without following social or moral laws, then violent emotional outbursts will become commonplace. But we must moderate these outbursts. From the perspective of practical interests, people have to obey social and moral laws. Thus, we have obligations and responsibilities. Under these dual influences, our thoughts and feelings gradually develop an outer shell. The formation of this outer shell is due to our desire to establish an unchanging law that everyone can abide by, to avoid conflicts between people caused by emotional outbursts. But if our passions cannot be completely eliminated, we have to try our best to hide them, and the outer shell of our thoughts and feelings hardens as a result. This is like the Earth wrapping the raging fire of its core with a gradually cooling thin skin. But the Earth often has volcanic eruptions. If the Earth is truly a living thing, as the myths say, then volcanic eruptions can be seen as the Earth's joy, just like the joy we feel during sleep from our most internal passions. The pleasure that drama gives us is this kind of Earth's joy."</p>
<p>Bergson also said, "To reveal naked nature to us is the highest purpose of art." This means that art must directly look at reality. This reality is no longer the objective reality assumed in previous concepts, but the reality that is grasped when the pure and simple spirit of individuality grapples with it. This is a common point in all modern art. The brilliance of modern philosophy and art lies in not ignoring the true and false instincts and impulses of individuals. The instincts and impulses of individual truth, or the vitality produced by wisdom, are enough to break through the barriers of established religion and morality. Modern drama based on this philosophy naturally often depicts the frustration produced by those who rely on their most internal vitality to grapple with established religion and morality. Past dramas also often depicted the suffering of life. However, the source of suffering for characters in past dramas was regret for their own weakness and violation of established religion and morality. Characters in modern dramas, however, often view established religion and morality as nothing more than empty masks that oppress pure and true human nature. Therefore, the attitude of characters in modern dramas is often one of struggling resistance. There is often fierce criticism of social organizations and even social customs. When we read the works of Ibsen and Strindberg, we admire Bergson's perspective even more. Therefore, some people say that the foundation of modern drama is actually built on modern philosophy with a spirit of fortune.</p>

<h3>Mussolini Apologizes to Young Friends</h3>

<p>(Reuters, Stockholm) Recently, several children in Hudiksvall, Sweden, saw an advertisement in a magazine for an Italian factory, claiming that the accordions made by the factory were the finest in the world.

<h3>General Agreement Between British and Italian Positions</h3>

<h3>Primary Principles of National Plans</h3>
<p>The primary principle of national plans is to engage in disarmament, not to resume the arms race. Herriot thinks this principle is very good. As for how this plan will be implemented, Herriot must wait until he fully understands how the international inspection system is organized before he can express his opinion. As for the military strength of various countries, the British plan has set numbers for each, but it has not mentioned the military strength that Britain should have, which Herriot finds strange. As for the consultation treaty mentioned, Herriot believes it is still questionable whether the United States will agree. Herriot also said that the German nationalist newspapers oppose the British plan and are spreading propaganda strongly.</p>

<h3>Arrest of British People in Moscow</h3>
<p>The British Government Sees the Situation as Serious</p>
<p>British-Russian Relations Will Be Affected</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th - The British government attaches great importance to the arrest of British employees of the Vickers Company by the Soviet authorities. This can be seen in the speech given by Overseas Autonomous Region Minister Thomas last night. Thomas said, "As far as I know, the most provocative thing for the British people is the arrest of many innocent British people by the Soviet Union. Those arrested are all people with legitimate occupations in commerce, who are self-respecting and harmless. It is absurd to say that these people participated in any conspiracy that would destroy their own lives. The motives of the Soviet Union's arbitrary arrest of British people are unknown here. But I know that previous governments deliberately created difficult foreign problems in order to divert the attention of their people from domestic affairs. If Russia's real purpose is this, then I dare say that the British people will not be deceived by it. Commercial relations must be based on mutual benefit. If you want to facilitate commercial relations, you must not allow this relationship to be subjected to improper obstacles. Although we do not approve of the Soviet Union's political goals, we have always expressed that we do not want to interfere in the Soviet Union's internal affairs. Now, if the Soviet Union believes that the commercial and diplomatic relations needed by both sides can continue when the British people are being trampled upon, then they are very wrong."</p>
<h3>Japan's Withdrawal from the League of Nations Issue</h3>

<h3>British Embassy Staff in Japan</h3>
<p>Secret Filming of Japanese Fortress</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Kokumin Shinbun on the 9th, recently, due to issues with the League of Nations, global economic panic, and a sudden negative impact on international relations, espionage incidents have been frequently discovered.

Therefore, the prosecution, military, and police authorities are taking extra precautions. Recently, in the Miura Misaki fortress area, Mr. and Mrs. Crowe, a secretary from the British Embassy in Japan, were caught filming. They hired a car to Misaki Town, Kanagawa, and used a sophisticated camera to film the area around the Misaki Battery. This area is a strictly prohibited military zone. Fortunately, the driver, Toyonosuke Kumazawa, noticed and seized their film plate. He suspected their behavior and immediately took Mr. Crowe to the battery surveillance station.

<h3>Military Progress in Jiangxi's Communist Suppression</h3>
<p>Hunan Army Enters Jiangxi in Multiple Routes to Assist in Suppression</p>
<p>Nanchang correspondence, Before Chiang Kai-shek went north, the Southwest and the two Guangs requested Chiang to supervise the northward expedition to resist Japan, while the suppression of the Red Army would be the responsibility of the Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian armies in order to divide the work. With the fall of Chengde, Chiang left Jiangxi and went north. Guangdong was extremely anxious, as it had reached a critical point of life and death. Resisting Japan was slow. Therefore, the 19th Route Army and the Eighth Route Army entered Jiangxi to suppress the bandits with great urgency, and the situation of suppressing the Reds changed greatly. Initially, the suppression of the Red Army was centered on Jiangxi, with no less than [number omitted] troops stationed in Jiangxi. The eastern part of Jiangxi was specifically under the control of the Central Route Commander [name omitted], whose forces numbered more than [number omitted] divisions. The pseudo-1st, 3rd, and 5th Army Corps, the pseudo-22nd Army, and Fang Shao's pseudo-10th Army, which were gathered on the border between Jiangxi and Fujian, retreated into Ningdu after being defeated in the siege of Nanfeng. At that time, the [number omitted] Column of the Central Route Army was advancing forward, and the bandits concentrated at one point, taking the opportunity to surround and attack a certain army with the 72nd Regiment of the Peng bandits' pseudo-3rd Army Corps, the Lin bandits' pseudo-3rd and 5th Regiments, the Luo bandits' pseudo-22nd Army, and the pseudo-Independent 4th and 5th Divisions. The two divisions charged left and right, fighting fiercely for three days, sacrificing many. Later, a certain division arrived on the eastern side and broke through the bandit formation in a chaotic battle, rescuing the two divisions. The bandits suffered heavy losses, with 7,000 to 8,000 wounded bandits transported back to Ruijin, which was truly a fatal blow. According to front-line news, the main force of the bandits had already traveled day and night to retreat to the dangerous mountainous areas of Wangpo, Xiaopudong, Shaokuzhuqianshan in Ningdu and Guangchang, and Zhaoxie in Lean, as well as the areas around Tengtian in Yongfeng, fortifying their positions and clearing the fields, and making new maps. It is said that the military authorities believe that the counties occupied by the Red bandits in southeastern Jiangxi still number more than ten, with deep mountains and forests, narrow paths, no grass in the fields, and no trace of humans. It is extremely difficult to march, let alone fight. Therefore, they are temporarily focusing on defense, clearing out the remaining bandits in the rear to prevent them from returning. The provinces of Fujian and Guangdong are actively planning to attack and annihilate the bandits in a concentrated manner. At a time when the provinces are carrying out a major encirclement and suppression, the Red bandits also know that they have reached their final juncture, and the remaining bandits in various places have also risen up to create disturbances in order to disperse the national army's forces. For example, Li Tianzhu, the commander of the pseudo-Xianggan Military Region in western Jiangxi, and Xiao Ke of the pseudo-Eighth Army's pseudo-22nd, 23rd, and Independent 12th Divisions, etc., recently invaded Anfu from Yongxin and Migang after their base of Ninggang was captured by a certain army, responding to the Kong bandits. The Kong bandits' pseudo-16th and 18th armies fled east from the border between Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, converting their pseudo-7th, 9th, and Independent Divisions into the pseudo-6th Army, penetrating the areas around Shanggao, Gaoan, Fengxin, and Jing'an. A few days ago, they even besieged the county seat of Fengxin, which is 120 li from the provincial capital. In addition to ordering a certain unit to defend, the commander also transferred a certain army into Jiangxi to maintain close contact and coordinate with the units in northern Fujian and eastern Jiangxi, actively searching for and suppressing Fang Shao's remaining bandits in the pseudo-Gan-Zhe-Min Military Region. Due to pressure, there is also talk that the pseudo-10th Army will move from the upper reaches of the Xin River to the lower reaches. (March 13th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province's Paper Currency Depreciation Wave</h3>
<p>Chen Jitang Assassination Attempt in Dongjiang</p>
<p>Profiteers Take the Opportunity to Spread Rumors for Personal Gain</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence, The new small denomination currency issued by the Guangdong Provincial Bank and the paper currency of the former Central Bank suddenly depreciated on the 10th of this month. At the same time, a rush to exchange currency occurred in front of the Provincial Bank. Starting on the 9th, there were many rumors that Chen Jitang had been assassinated in Dongjiang, and important figures in the political world were living in seclusion, causing some panic among the people. However, in reality, the rumors originated from unscrupulous merchants manipulating the paper currency, seeking to profit from the opportunity. It was found that the depreciation of the currency was about 5 to 8 yuan per 1,000 yuan on the morning of the 10th, falling to 12 to 13 yuan in the afternoon. The number of people holding currency to exchange for cash at the Provincial Bank suddenly increased. The Provincial Bank exchanged more than 70,000 yuan in cash on the afternoon of the 10th, and 200,000 to 300,000 yuan on the 11th. Fortunately, the bank's reserves were sufficient, so the exchange was carried out as soon as people arrived. Because this new small denomination currency has 50% cash reserves and 50% real estate as collateral, and the number of new small denomination currency with a face value of 1 yuan and 2 yuan issued is only slightly more than 13 million yuan, there is no oversupply in the market. As for the 5 yuan and 10 yuan paper currency of the former Central Bank, about 6 million yuan is circulating in the market. The total amount of soft currency in the market is 19 million yuan. Yesterday, in order to further reduce the amount of soft currency in the market, the Provincial Bank decided to announce the suspension of the full exchange of 5 yuan and 10 yuan Central Bank paper currency, and to recover and destroy it within one month through the Provincial Bank. In this way, there will be 6 million less paper currency in the market, and the demand for the new small denomination currency will definitely increase. It is expected that the depreciation trend will subside within a day or two. In order to facilitate the exchange, the Provincial Bank was open for exchange as usual on the 12th, even though it was a Sunday. Furthermore, the Provincial Government, the Finance Department, and the Provincial Bank have jointly issued a proclamation to suspend the exchange of old 5 yuan and 10 yuan Central Bank paper currency.

<h3>Preparations for Construction of the Guangshan Railway</h3>
<p>Realization of Joint Operation of the Shanhui Highway</p>
<p>Difficulties in Dongjiang Transportation Can Be Avoided</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence, The Guangshan Railway, which runs directly from Guangzhou to Shantou, is parallel to the first main line of the Eastern District Provincial Highway. Last winter, the provincial government approved preparations for construction. Once this road is completed, the traffic between the province and Shantou can avoid maritime storms and the detours through Hong Kong. It is very important from a military and commercial perspective. The provincial government also appointed Long Sihui, Cai Chang, Chen Shaowen, and 12 others as preparation committee members. Long, Cai, and Chen served as standing committee members. The draft of the road construction stock offering regulations has now been completed. The planned project is to build a double-track light railway in order to complete it quickly. Long and others will arrive in Shantou within days to establish a preparation committee. The construction of this road can achieve twice the result with half the effort due to the auxiliary support of the Eastern Route Main Line for surveying, construction, and erection.</p>
<p>The first main line of the Eastern Route Highway has already been opened to traffic in sections this spring, but joint operations have not been implemented. During Chen Jitang's tour, he passed through various highways and felt the need to promote joint operations and traffic. Therefore, he ordered the Eastern District Highway Office to plan joint operations. Yesterday, Li Hua, the director of the Eastern District Highway Office, summoned representatives of the highway board of directors and car companies to Shantou for a joint operations meeting. More than a dozen people attended. After each person reported on the traffic situation on their section, the following joint operations methods were decided: (1) The Huishan Road is divided into three stations. The first station is from Zhangmutou on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to Yuandun in Haifeng. The second station is from Yuandun to Kuitan in Huilai. The third station is from Kuitan to Wutian in Shantou, opposite the sea. Tickets are sold in sections for every 10 li at 2 jiao. (2) Travel time: Eastbound cars depart from Zhangmutou at 6:00 AM, arrive at Yuandun at 9:00 AM, and passengers disembark for breakfast. Depart from Yuandun at 9:10 AM, arrive at Kuitan at 1:00 PM, and passengers disembark for lunch. Depart from Kuitan at 2:00 PM and arrive at Wutian Station at 6:00 PM. Westbound cars depart from Wutian at 5:00 AM, arrive at Kuitan at 8:40 AM for breakfast, depart from Kuitan at 9:00 AM, arrive at Yuandun at 12:40 PM for lunch, depart from Yuandun at 1:00 PM, and arrive at Zhangmutou Daan Station at 5:40 PM, connecting to the Guangzhou-Kowloon night train and arriving in the provincial capital at 8:00 PM. (3) Preparation of vehicles at each station: Jifeng Company is responsible for the Wu-Kui section every day, designating two vehicles. Puyi and Lufeng Companies each prepare one vehicle for the Kui-Yuan section. Haifeng County is responsible for preparing two vehicles. Pingren and Huiping Companies are responsible for the Hui-Yuan section, preparing four vehicles, waiting for passengers to connect on time. (4) Military police vehicle rides: It was decided that the highway office would submit a proclamation to the Eastern District Pacification Commissioner's Office, ordering all defense forces and county magistrates to instruct their subordinates to comply with the regulations. Please instruct the troops and guards stationed along the way by the Eastern District Commissioner's Office to protect the traffic and send troops to guard the important locations. The above are the trial operation methods, which will be implemented within this month. (March 9th)</p>

<h3>Zhu Qinglan's Urgent Telegram</h3>
<h3>Recent Situation After the Enemy's Defeat at Xifengkou</h3>
<p>A Fierce Battle is Imminent - Please Send Large Sums of Money and Medicine Quickly</p>
<h3>Sun Kuiyuan Prepaid 10,000 Yuan for慰問</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Northeastern Relief Refugee Association received a letter from Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, saying: "Gentlemen of the association, after the enemy's disastrous defeat at Xifengkou, they have been bombing our positions with a large number of planes for days, in order to contain us. On the one hand, on the 16th, with a mixed brigade or more of troops, they launched a rapid and fierce attack on our Luowenyu position, hoping to disturb our rear. Commander Liu Ruming of Song's army led his troops to meet the enemy in three shifts, and after a day and night of fierce fighting, the enemy concentrated firepower with machine guns and cannons, and bombed with dozens of planes, but our army stood firm. Later, Commander Liu, with bare arms, led his troops to attack the enemy, killing four or five hundred people, breaking through two enemy defense lines, capturing five enemy officers and seizing many guns, cannons, and bullets. A small number of the enemy fled in defeat, and most were annihilated. Currently, reinforcements are being added to advance toward Xifengkou. A fierce battle is imminent. The front line lacks materials, and the bloody battles are almost without funds. As for the wounded and dead soldiers, they are all awaiting relief. Thinking of this, I am overwhelmed with grief. Gentlemen, you are eager to serve the country, and I believe it is even more so than I, Lan. Please quickly raise a large sum of money and gather more medicines to be flown to the front to meet the urgent needs. This is my sincere hope." Zhu Qinglan respectfully asks. The Northeastern Refugee Relief Association, the Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association, the Shanghai Northeastern Refugee Relief Association, etc. received a telegram from Sun Kuiyuan on the 16th, saying: "I have just received a telegram from our military office in Ping (15th), and I am also grateful for your association's prepaid 10,000 yuan for慰問. At this time of national crisis, when finances are extremely tight, our army is defending the country and should use it appropriately. Comrades, you have gathered together to show your deep love for the country. I am deeply grateful for your generous contribution. I will continue to strive to live up to your kindness. I will notify you separately when the money arrives. First, I send this telegram to express my gratitude. Respectfully, I wish you good planning."

<p>No Longer Firmly Declining Reinstatement - The Railway Bureau Has Prepared a Train to Depart</p>
<p>Since President Wang Jingwei returned to the country from his illness and arrived in Shanghai, he visited President Sun Zhesheng of the Legislative Yuan yesterday morning to discuss various important matters such as diplomacy. Mr. Wang left the Chu residence on Albert Road at 9:30 this morning and drove to Yuyuan Road to visit Mr. Cai Yuanpei for about half an hour. After leaving, because he was tired from the sea voyage in recent days, he drove to the wilderness in the western suburbs of Shanghai to breathe fresh air, and returned to the Chu residence at 10:40. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>No Problem with Reinstatement</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang previously requested resignation due to illness, in order to facilitate his treatment abroad. The Central Government, in the autumn of internal and external troubles, had high expectations for Mr. Wang, so it specially granted him leave to go abroad for treatment. Mr. Wang's illness has now recovered, and although he expressed his intention to ask President Song to continue to be responsible for the reinstatement issue when he arrived in Shanghai, after repeated requests from all parties in recent days, Mr. Wang is no longer firmly declining. He plans to enter Beijing tonight and, after meeting with the Central Committee in Beijing, he can be reinstated.</p>
<h3>Special Train Prepared to Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>According to a Central News Agency reporter, President Wang, President Song, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu, Minister of Communications Zhu Jiaohua, Deputy Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, and Deputy Minister of the Interior Gan Naiguang are all scheduled to take the night train to Beijing tonight. The Railway Bureau has prepared several special trains, ready to depart. It is also learned that the Song residence has notified the Railway Bureau to prepare a flower car for Mr. Wang to ride in.</p>
<h3>Zeng Zhongming Visits Song</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Wang arrived in Shanghai, he has been busy with private affairs and urgently needs to enter Beijing. Therefore, at around 10 o'clock this morning, he specially sent Deputy Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming to visit President Song to discuss matters.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Will Return to Beijing on the Night Train the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Submitting a Proposal for Unified Military Affairs with Yu Youren</p>
<p>Central Committee member Sun Ke came to Shanghai from Beijing this time and met with Mr. Wang at his private residence yesterday morning. In addition to reminiscing about the past, they briefly discussed party, government, and military affairs. Mr. Sun is now scheduled to return to Beijing on the night train on the 21st. It is reported that Mr. Yu Youren and other members of the Central Committee have a proposal for a unified military plan due to the urgent situation of military resistance. The principles have been submitted to the Central Government, and the full case will be discussed at the Central Political Council meeting on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Zhuang Zuobin Postpones Coming to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhuang Zuobin, our country's ambassador to Japan, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning to pay his respects to President Wang and report everything. He learned that President Wang was about to enter Beijing, so he temporarily canceled his trip to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Fang Benren Will Go to Beijing the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Escorting Shao Hongji North to Investigate the Tang Case Thoroughly</p>
<p>Fang Benren, the representative of the Military Commission for thoroughly investigating the Tang Yulin case, came to Shanghai a few days ago to prepare his luggage and is scheduled to go to Beijing the day after tomorrow, escorting Shao Hongji, the representative of the Control Yuan, north to jointly investigate the truth about Tang Yulin's withdrawal from Chengde with the representative of the Executive Yuan, in order to report to the Central Government for verification.</p>
<h3>Painful Announcement to the Government</h3>
<h3>Mongolia Will No Longer Be Ours</h3>
<p>Most of the League and Banner Princes Obey the Central Government - Mongolian Representatives Advocate Reorganizing the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission</p>
<p>Bai Duan, a member of the Supervisory Committee, Dekejike, a member of the Military Council, and Liu Zhanyi, a member of the Mongolian Culture Promotion Association, who are representatives of the leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia stationed in Beijing, came to Shanghai to welcome Wang Jingwei's return to China and made a petition regarding Mongolian affairs. This morning, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed them at their residence and asked about the current situation in Mongolia and their mission to Shanghai. Mongolia gave a detailed answer as follows:</p>
<h3>Inner Mongolian Leagues and Banners</h3>
<p>Mongolia is divided into Inner and Outer Mongolia. Outer Mongolia has long been independent and has no relationship with the Central Government for the time being, so it will not be discussed. Inner Mongolia originally had two leagues, two independent banners, and two special departments. The number of banners under each league varied. The six leagues had a total of 53 banners, plus the independent banners and special departments, totaling 57 banners. They were located in the western part of Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, and the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. The total population is about 5 million.</p>
<h3>Half Has Been Lost</h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the Northeast has fallen, and thus the Zhelmeng League and Hulunbuir Special Department in the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, and the Ikeming'an Independent Banner, have come under Japanese influence. This year, with the fall of Rehe, the Zhuozhao Leagues are also under enemy cavalry. Now, only the Xiwuyi Leagues and the Chahar Special Department, and the Tumote Independent Banner, within the borders of the two provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, remain.</p>
<h3>Mongolian Attitude</h3>
<p>Although the leagues and banners in the three northeastern provinces have fallen to the enemy cavalry, they cannot resist due to the disparity in strength. However, the Mongolian attitude towards Japan is extremely firm. The Japanese originally intended to organize a puppet state of Manchuria and Mongolia, but they could not realize it because no Mongolians were willing to be used. They only called it Manchuria. Later, representatives of the banners and princes, aware of the crisis of Japanese invasion into Rehe and Hebei, jointly went to Beijing in December last year to petition for a plan to reorganize Inner Mongolia. The Central Government also expressed great concern and sympathy.</p>
<h3>Gaps Between Top and Bottom</h3>
<p>The highest authority in charge of Mongolian affairs in the Central Government is the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, but those in charge of the commission are ignorant of the Mongolian situation and seem indifferent to the rise and fall of Inner Mongolia. They have met the suggestions of representatives of the leagues and banners with indifference. Before and after the fall of Rehe this year, the leagues and banners also sent telegrams reporting their situation, but they were all kept in the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. Therefore, the leagues and banners have difficulty expressing their opinions to the Central Government, and there has been no improvement in Mongolian affairs, which is quite disappointing.</p>
<h3>Visiting Wang to Petition</h3>
<p>We came to Shanghai this time to welcome Mr. Wang Jingwei and petition the Central Government to improve Mongolian politics, reorganize the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and break the current state of indifference in the Central Government, so that local opinions can reach the Central Government and eliminate gaps. Yesterday, we visited Mr. Wang, who expressed great approval.</p>
<h3>League and Banner Organization</h3>
<p>Although half of the leagues and banners in Inner Mongolia have fallen, the rest are also on the verge of war zones, which is very dangerous. However, their attitude towards Japan is extremely firm. They vow not to be slaves to a foreign country. The league and banner system was originally a military organization. The basic organization is the 佐, with a 佐領 commanding 500 soldiers. Four 佐 form a 甲, with a 參領. Each banner includes a varying number of 甲, from six or seven to more than ten. The league is the name of the annual military exercises of the banners and is purely a military system. They also have considerable modern weapons and can be used.</p>
<h3>Progress in Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>Inner and Outer Mongolia are of the same ethnicity, with the same religion and customs. Outer Mongolia has been independent for many years, and the government has always wanted to appease them. However, it can only be effective after Inner Mongolia has a solution. Liu Zhanyi went to Outer Mongolia twice in 1924 and 1928 for investigation. Its politics, economy, and culture are all thriving and have the image of a new country. On the other hand, Inner Mongolia is gradually progressing. It is impossible to talk about Outer Mongolia returning. We hope that the Central Government will actively improve the government in Inner Mongolia as the foundation for recovering Outer Mongolia.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Orders Post Offices</h3>
<h3>Establish Temporary Post Offices on the Rehe Border</h3>
<p>Advancing and Retreating with the Anti-Japanese Troops</p>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Post Office, since the fall of Chengde, all post offices in Rehe Province have either been seized by the Japanese army or have ceased operations. Now, the Ministry of Communications authorities, in order to ensure the rapid transmission of war news, has specially ordered the post offices to establish temporary post offices within the anti-Japanese troops on the Rehe border, advancing and retreating with the army, and must earnestly obtain contact. The method will follow the established practice of the blockade of the Northeast postal service. After receiving the order, the post office has now forwarded the order to the postal staff remaining in Rehe to quickly organize and establish it to facilitate the war effort.</p>
<h3>Second Batch Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<h3>Antiquities Will Arrive Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the second batch of antiquities transported south had been loaded in Pukou and transported to Shanghai and would arrive tomorrow (i.e., today). A reporter from Datong News Agency went to China Merchants Bureau this morning to inquire about the time of arrival of the antiquities in Shanghai. According to reports, the second batch of antiquities transported south was transported from Ping to Pukou on the evening of the 17th, and it was only this morning that it was transferred by China Merchants Bureau's Kuailei Wheel to Shanghai. It is estimated that it will arrive in Shanghai at about 10 am tomorrow. The rumor that it will arrive in Shanghai today is inaccurate.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Presents to Ministry of Finance</h3>
<h3>Please Amend the Newspaper Import Tax</h3>
<p>Change from Specific Tax to Ad Valorem Tax</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce presented to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that on the 18th of this month, it received a letter from the Paper Industry Association stating that the import newspaper tax rate No. 513 in Category 10, announced by the National Government on December 29, 1930, was (A) 1.5 customs gold units per擔 for rolled paper and (B) 1.6 customs gold units per擔 for other (i.e., packaged) paper. In November 1932, the rolled paper was changed to 7.5% of the value. It has been stipulated and announced. The current market price of newspaper is about 86 customs gold units per ton. Calculated at 7.5% of the value according to No. 513 (A), the customs gold should be 6.45 customs gold units. Calculated according to the provision of 1.6 customs gold units per擔 in (B), the customs gold should be 26.88 customs gold units per ton, a difference of four times. For newspapers, rolled paper is mostly used by large newspaper offices such as Shenbao and Xinwenbao, which have strong capital and complete equipment, while packaged paper is mostly used by small newspaper offices in the local and foreign ports for printing news and by bookstores for printing textbooks and books and magazines. The same goods are necessary for cultural promotion, but the tax rate is different, which is not fair. Therefore, the letter is reported, and the Association is requested to review and approve the transfer to the Tariff Committee of the Ministry of Finance of the National Government to amend the newspaper tax rate (A) and (B) of No. 513 in Category 10 to a general value of 7.5%, so as to avoid differences and eliminate malpractices. The import of newspapers is necessary for cultural dissemination, and the tax should not be too high. In November last year, it was stipulated as 7.5% of the value, which is the purpose. However, rolled newspapers are changed to ad valorem tax, while packaged newspapers are still taxed according to the amount, resulting in the same newspaper being taxed four times more than rolled newspapers, which is unfavorable to cultural undertakings with smaller capital, and it is necessary to correct it. It is reasonable to prepare a document based on the facts and transfer it to the Ministry, hoping that the Ministry will review and approve the import tax of item B of No. 513, which will also be changed to the ad valorem tax of 7.5% according to item A, so as to eliminate unfairness.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Convenes Representatives from Various Routes</h3>
<h3>Meeting to Promote the Combined Transport Plan</h3>
<p>To be Held in Beijing at the End of This Month - And Solicit Various Opinions</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Railways has been handling the joint transportation of responsible routes, the freight transportation has been developing rapidly due to the simple procedures and the possibility of paying upon arrival. However, some routes have not yet implemented the combined transportation due to various reasons, which affects the freight revenue. In order to promote the combined transportation plan and complete the entire combined transportation of various routes across the country as soon as possible, it is specifically scheduled to convene representatives from various routes across the country at the Ministry at the end of this month to discuss the active implementation methods. It has now been ordered to the various railway bureaus to send representatives to Beijing to attend the meeting with proposals and opinion letters at that time. It is heard that the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration in this city has already prepared a plan for the development of combined transportation and various opinion letters in preparation for discussion at the meeting.</p>

<p>According to today's Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, at 7:50 last night, the Western Japan Reservists Association held a military lecture meeting at the headquarters of Naimomian. Due to the very bleak outlook for the current situation, the audience was very enthusiastic, and there was almost no room to stand in the venue. First, Vice President Ueki gave an opening speech, followed by Lieutenant Colonel Hirata, who gave a speech on Japan's policy towards East Asia. Until after 10 o'clock, Research Minister Nakazawa gave a closing speech and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Anhui Bandits Commit Numerous Crimes</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Western detectives of the Yangshupu Police Station apprehended more than a dozen Anhui male and female bandits, including Chen Youming and Wu Yuchang. An investigation revealed that from December last year to February this year, these people robbed Huang Zongying at No. 191 Linqing Road, Pan Heshang's bungalow on Meizhou Road, and Zhou Wang's family at No. 781 Taifa Lane on Xinza Road, valued at more than 1,000 yuan. They were escorted to the Special Zone Court for trial and detention in the case for rescheduling. Chen and Wu confessed to the robbery in the Zha Road case, and three accomplices, Zhang Xiaofu, Yang Chensan, and Zhou Shenhai, fled to Suzhou to commit crimes. They were apprehended by the local government and sentenced to imprisonment. The police station sent detectives with documents to the Suzhou Local Court to transfer the three criminals to Shanghai and escort them to the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the police station, stated the previous situation. After Judge Xiao questioned the three defendants, they were vague in their language and were ordered to be detained pending joint trial with Chen Youming and others.</p>
<h3>Opium Traffickers Caught Feeling Guilty</h3>

Two Cantonese men were approaching them and, upon seeing the detectives conducting searches, looked flustered and tried to avoid them by detouring. The detectives noticed their expression and intercepted them, seizing more than 100 ounces of Yunnan opium. They were detained in the police station. After a preliminary trial by the police chief, it was learned that the two Cantonese men, Guo Aqing and Chen Kekai, were opium traffickers.</p>

Zhang recently contracted a part of the China Merchants Bureau's business. Due to the lack of funds, he was depressed. After getting up at 7 o'clock this morning, he instructed his wife, Zhou, to borrow money from her relatives and friends. Because she was unable to repay the loan, she found it difficult to open her mouth, and a conflict arose between them. Then, Zhang cut his wife's back with a knife, about half an inch deep, and blood gushed out. She was later sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment by ambulance.</p>

<p>Women's Employee Life Special Issue (1)</p>
<p>Amateur Chat</p>
<h3>She is the Mother Who Creates a New Nation</h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>Dear readers: Today's national crisis lies not in the non-resistance policy of a small number of warlords and bureaucrats who live in ease and comfort, but in the lack of national consciousness, spirit of resistance, decline and discouragement, and depression of most of the people. Men are like this, and women are even more so. To remedy this phenomenon, in addition to all symptomatic emergency encouragements, we should pay attention to the cultivation of the entire national consciousness. And before studying the issue of cultivation, we must first understand the living conditions of most of the people, and then we can have a basis for planning the steps for cultivation. We will now discuss Shanghai as the scope. Most of the people in Shanghai are workers and merchants, so the content of this journal focuses on the research of the lives of workers and employees in the industrial and commercial sectors and the discussion of improvement methods.</p>
<p>In the past short period of experience, we have deeply felt that the so-called decadent and disheartened national spirit is greatly related to the aspect of family education, because the teacher of family education is the mother, not the father. This is what makes us pay attention to the living conditions of female employees. As for not issuing a general women's special issue, but this small-scale female employee special issue, the reason is:</p>
<p>First, because the target of this journal is employees, and those women who do not engage in production are idle all day long, and there is no such thing as amateur, so they are not within the scope of this journal;</p>
<p>Second, originally the scope of our word "worker" and "employee" can not be limited to female workers and female clerks who work in factories, and those who serve in other undertakings can also be called workers and employees. The only difference is that most of the manuscripts received belong to female workers and female clerks.</p>
<p>When we see the living conditions of a group of female workers and female employees in Shanghai and think of the current situation of most of the women in the country who are responsible for the first part of the work of reviving the nation | family education |, we can't help but express infinite fear for the future of the nation. We don't measure our strength, we don't ask how small this voice is, and issuing these issues of the female employee special issue is to urge the people of the country who are worried about the demise of the country and who are thinking of reviving the nation to pay attention. We hope that when the fire burns to the eyebrows and we realize that the national spirit is 12 points weak, we should not forget that she is the mother who produces a new nation! How should we improve their lives, strengthen their physiques, enlighten their knowledge, and cultivate their basic ability to produce a new nation!</p>

<h3>Electric Torture</h3>
<p>— Ms. Ping</p>
<p>Telephone Exchange Operator</p>
<p>It was the end of late autumn, the beginning of my economic independence, and also the beginning of the loss of my health! At that time, I was a newly arrived female trainee at the 乂 Telephone Exchange. The first time I sat on that active chair with a steel frame—that chair was particularly high, and it was very uncomfortable at first. At the same time, I had to wear a curved steel piece more than an inch wide on my head, with an earpiece suspended at each end, pressing tightly against my ears, as if I were deaf. If someone spoke more than ten feet away from us, we couldn't hear anything clearly. Those two earpieces attached to that steel piece weighed more than two pounds. When I first wore it, it would really make you feel dizzy and faint! In addition to these tools, we also had to use a wide belt with a microphone hanging from it.</p>
<p>Once we put on those tools, we guarded the switchboard numbers like a cat watching a mouse, because each person had to manage more than a hundred numbers. Especially since we were trainees, if we were even slightly careless, we would overlook the incoming calls from users. My practice time was mostly from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM or from 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM. During the morning shift, I had to go to the telephone exchange at 6:30 AM so that I could rest for a few minutes when I got there. Otherwise, if I had to put on those torture-like tools right after running a bit, it would really be deadly!</p>
<p>Later, gradually, the number of female telephone exchange operators increased day by day. Naturally, I was one of the more skilled trainees, so I was changed to work the middle shift every other day. Working the middle shift was the most frightening, as more than a dozen calls would come in at once. No matter how quick you were, you would still be in a flurry.</p>
<p>Ah! Ah! In short, we were constantly shouting "Hello! Hello!" all day long, and our ears were being bombarded by the "Boom! Boom!" of the electric current, sometimes even to the point of making our brains faint!</p>
<p>My body was still alright. After suffering for a few months, my spirit was still vigorous, but some of my less healthy colleagues were being tormented by illness. As a result, the number of sick leave days increased day by day, but the regulations of the exchange did not allow you to take leave casually. If you were really sick, you still had to have a doctor's certificate to be allowed to take two or three days off. Otherwise, did you think you could steal even a quarter of an hour to be lazy?</p>
<p>The exchange regulations became stricter and stricter, and many such penalties were established: If someone was one quarter of an hour late for their shift, they would receive a minor demerit; if they were half an hour late, they would receive a major demerit; if they were an hour late, one day's wages would be deducted; and if they didn't show up for their entire shift, they would be dismissed unconditionally. Furthermore, two minor demerits would be combined into one major demerit, and anyone who received two major demerits would be listed for dismissal.</p>
<p>In addition, there were all sorts of temporary penalties: Shouting "Hello! Hello!" for a full five hours would cause your throat to break. If you couldn't find a colleague to help you and had to resolutely leave your station to take a sip of water, you would have five dollars deducted from your wages! Ah! How bitter! At this time, we really didn't know whether to value money or life! Also, in the gloomy depths of spring, telephone connections were greatly affected, making it difficult for people to get through. Outsiders only knew to blame the operators, but in fact, most of it should be attributed to the imprecision of the circuits. However, in our situation, how could we have any room for explanation? For example, if some important person couldn't get through on the phone, that would be terrible! They would send a letter, and the exchange would take it seriously and investigate which machine was used by which operator at what time on what day. Once it was found out, that operator would receive a major demerit or have five dollars deducted from their wages! Ah! Please think about it, our brain fluid was being dried up by the electric current, and we were only earning twelve dollars a month. If we were fined three times a month, how would we have any money to make up for it?</p>
<p>The number of colleagues taking sick leave increased day by day, mostly suffering from headaches. There were even two who had hemoptysis! The exchange only gave those two ten days off, and the rest had to wait for someone to be sent to their homes to investigate before giving a reply.</p>
<p>Ah! The terror of hemoptysis and headaches was almost always swirling in my mind! In addition, there was another frightening image, and that was the crippled male foreman, who would often unconsciously faint on the ground! It was said that this disease was the result of being a switchboard operator for more than thirty years. Now, although he had been promoted from operator to foreman, his salary was only one hundred dollars, and his precious health had been sacrificed for it!</p>
<p>Alas! The thing I feared also happened! Every day when I was on duty, my brain was in extreme pain! Those "crackling, crackling" electric currents were hitting my eardrums without any regard for strength, which really frightened me to the extreme. I really feel that my memory has become gradually dulled, and my health has been completely lost. However, driven by hunger, under the modern capitalist system, what can I do?</p>
<p>Amateur Coffee</p>
<h3>The Terror of Male Employees</h3>
<p>— Cao Zhong</p>
<p>(The world today is really not the world!) Old Wang sighed deeply and said: "In the future, I predict that men will have no food to eat! Take our company, for example. Ten years ago, were there any female employees there? Look now, upstairs and downstairs, everywhere is full of women. As for the men, I don't know where they've all gone. The remaining ones of us can be considered rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, but one day we will all be squeezed out by them. In the future, men will all go home to hold babies and simply hand the world over to women! I really don't understand why people today all like to hire women. It's all because people's hearts have changed, and the world is not the world anymore!"</p>
<p>After Old Wang finished speaking, he sighed deeply twice to express the accumulated resentment in his heart. Yes, Old Wang's company was like this, and other companies were no different. In the past two years, female shop assistants in society have sprung up like mushrooms after the rain, but this is not a strange phenomenon, but rather has its origin. This precisely indicates that the forces of China's feudal economic system are collapsing at an accelerating rate, and the forces of the pro-American capitalist economic system are rapidly rushing into China's territory.</p>
<p>Originally, under the capitalist economic system, labor power has become a commodity. Commodities with cheap prices are easy to sell, and labor power with low costs is also easy to be hired. As a result, female workers squeeze out male workers, and child workers squeeze out female workers. The cost of labor power becomes increasingly cheap, and the unemployed masses become increasingly large. Of course, male employees cannot escape this law and will eventually suffer the fate of "then we will eventually be squeezed out by them."</p>
<p>Moreover, the character of women is more docile than that of men. In other words, women are easier to control than men, and they also have a side effect of "attracting customers." Therefore, bosses, supervisors, and managers all feel that hiring women is much more cost-effective than hiring men. This is the second reason why female shop assistants are springing up like mushrooms.</p>
<p>Indeed, female shop assistants are springing up like this.</p>
<p>Old Wang doesn't know that this is the inevitable result produced under the modern economic system and mistakenly blames it on (people's hearts changing greatly). Therefore, he ultimately just sighs.</p>
<p>If you want women to serve society and squeeze out men's jobs, you can only find it in another world with a different system!</p>
<h3>Laugh! Laugh!</h3>
<p>— Ms. Huang</p>
<p>Waitress in a Restaurant</p>
<p>I can no longer imagine that any man will love me!</p>
<p>At night, after the clock strikes eight, in the brightly lit restaurant, we, who are oppressed by life, are busy asking customers to order wine and dishes and delivering hot towels to the customers' hands. Many of them are handsome and wealthy young men who, while drinking glasses of wine, are constantly watching us. At first, I was a little surprised, but later my joints became numb, and I could only fake a smile to swindle money.</p>
<p>"Bring a towel, little girl!" These interesting men often call out like this.</p>
<p>"Oh! Coming!"</p>
<p>They always lightly brush my hand when they take the towel.</p>
<p>"Can you drink wine?"</p>
<p>"Where! Hehe!" I give a flirtatious smile.</p>
<p>"How old are you this year?"</p>
<p>"Guess! If you guess right, I'll call you good!"</p>
<p>"Eighteen years old!"</p>
<p>"Oh! How did you know!"</p>
<p>"Haha!"</p>
<p>If this man is a clumsy fellow, he won't come to tease me, and I seem to be serious! Because flirting also has a price, the most</p>
<p>Usually one dollar or seventy or eighty cents of wine money. I loathe this life, and I want to escape this fiery pit, but what about bread? What about money? I can no longer imagine that any man will love me!</p>
<h3>The Manager's Nephew</h3>
<p>— Shen Qianli</p>
<p>Female Staff in the Circulation Department</p>
<p>One morning, in our group, where we all felt that life was monotonous, an opposite sex actually graced us with their presence, because a new female employee had joined the circulation department, which added a lot of vitality to our usually silent office. Women, after all, possess a special magic, or perhaps even a stimulant for life; at least that's what I think. Many colleagues had never been so excited as they were this morning, at most just saying "Good morning" to each other. Indeed, this morning was a little different. Each person, when walking in the door, would take a mysterious glance toward the circulation department, as if their consciousness was attracted by the magnet on that table. As usual. A "Good morning" was said louder than usual by everyone. Everyone's nerves seemed to have been violently shaken, and they were all laughing and joking with each other without any scruples, especially showing off their own strengths, as if they were intentionally or unintentionally giving this new female colleague a hint.</p>
<p>Old Wang in the circulation department, because he wanted to take a month-long vacation to go back and get married, was replaced by me in the circulation department under the manager's orders. This once again aroused the colleagues' dissatisfaction, as if I had obtained this favorable position through scheming, which was too inappropriate, so they could be heard making cold and sarcastic remarks from time to time.</p>
<p>"Hey! Old Li's luck with women is really not shallow! The work in the circulation department is also easy; and he can also have fun with that widow..." Little Wang turned his head and said to Old Zhang.</p>
<p>"Isn't that right! Damn it, usually when anyone here takes leave, it's always two people's work combined for one person to do," Accountant Old Zhang interrupted before Little Wang could finish, meaning to curse the manager's treatment as somewhat unfair.</p>
<p>"Yes! Those things in the circulation department, like sticking stamps, writing envelopes, and greeting people when they buy things, even a blind person could do it, and you still need to find someone to help him. Damn it, I'm busy here! When I get busy, I should also ask the manager to find me a woman..." Little Wang paused at this point. "Oh my! Forget it! Would you have women in your export department send things to other places? The circulation department is because they want a woman to be a (signboard), (to attract customers)! Haha!" Old Zhang laughed triumphantly.</p>
<p>If it is said that women's occupations are just to be a (vase) (signboard) for the sake of . But it is not necessarily always the case. In their physical strength, some heavy work is indeed not as well suited to men as it is to women. Apart from this, it is not necessarily that men can do it, but women cannot.</p>
<p>For example, what Miss Zhao does in the circulation department cannot be said to be too little either. As I see it, almost some of the male colleagues may not be able to handle it. She has to entertain customers who come to the door, and also deal with many letters from other places purchasing goods, and at the same time, she has to answer people's inquiries about the current prices of goods. All these complex and irregular things are done by her alone. If you still want to say that she is just a (living signboard) that is only good-looking and does nothing, then it would be too unjust!</p>
<p>I remember a common saying in our hometown: (Three people helping one person can do things well, three people crowding one person makes things difficult). Now I carefully savor this sentence, and it is indeed an unbreakable truth. Miss Zhao sacrificed her job in this environment of squeezing. It seemed that that morning, as soon as I stepped into the office, I saw her sitting there by herself, her face flushed with anger, arguing with Old Zhang. She said: (Do you think I'm like the (vase) in your kind of despicable thoughts? Humph! I see that you seem to have received higher education, how can you not even protect your own personality, and fully believe that I can be insulted by you at will, so you use the actions of a gigolo on the street in this kind of place...)</p>
<p>(Alright!) Miss Zhao, we're all working together; isn't it embarrassing to quarrel?) I saw that they were arguing and it was not easy to resolve, so I tried to mediate.</p>
<p>(Embarrassing? Isn't it embarrassing for him to open my letters privately?) She glanced at me angrily. I knew she had misunderstood my meaning. In fact, I didn't know that Old Zhang had opened her letters. I just stared at her, unable to explain in her anger. Fortunately, the manager came in a moment, and this disturbance was finally calmed down temporarily. Old Zhang is the manager's nephew, and his position is more solid than cast iron. The one who was sacrificed was naturally Miss Zhao.</p>
<p>The next morning, I was working alone in the circulation department again: Old Zhang still looked at me from time to time, showing his triumphant smile.</p>

<h3>Laborious Woman Seeks Dentist</h3>

<p>When people lose a tooth, they have to ask a dentist to fill it, because the gap is not only inconvenient for speaking, but also inevitably makes them feel backward when it comes to eating.</p>

<h3>Twenty Dollars</h3>
<p>— Yao Ying</p>
<p>Female Staff in a Large Department Store</p>
<p>During a summer vacation, the date is blurred, I saw an advertisement in the Shen Bao, 　　company recruiting female employees, I sent a resume and a recent photo out of curiosity. Less than a week later, a registered letter was sent by the post office, stating that the exam would be held on 　day　time. At that time, I felt a strange feeling in my heart, whether it was joy or sorrow, I couldn't tell for a while.</p>
<p>The exam was very plain. A few very common English conversations, there was no essay, but you had to write the names of a few daily necessities, and the abacus was for addition and multiplication. There was also one of the most difficult things, which was answering questions in Cantonese. When I was leaving, a man in a suit said one sentence: Can pass. I later learned that he was the manager.</p>
<p>I got such an unexpected good fortune, and I happily told my parents, and I thought I could be independent from then on. Hadn't I already become a female employee? But now that I think about it, I find it very laughable.</p>
<p>The first day of service was Monday. Naturally, I will never forget this day, because I specially went to buy a new pair of high-heeled leather shoes the night before, worth fifteen dollars, and also bought some odds and ends, totaling thirty dollars, which opened a new chapter in my spending. This is probably because I was thinking like this: From tomorrow on, I can earn money.</p>
<p>I was assigned to work in the cosmetics department. The first few days of work made me feel troubled and interesting, calling "Mr." hundreds of times because there were many specially named goods that I couldn't find. That colleague was still polite.</p>
<p>The salary is twenty dollars, and they provide one lunch. Office hours are from 9:00 am to 8:00 pm, with Sunday mornings off.</p>
<p>Statistics show that couples of young men and women who come to buy things every day account for 60%, single women account for 30%, and men in suits and leather shoes account for 10%. There are no elderly people or children.</p>
<p>As for daily life, in addition to accepting customers' purchases, I only look at the clock and passing customers for self-entertainment.</p>
<p>In short, I was living a lonely life in the midst of excitement, and I still couldn't make ends meet. Therefore, I resigned when I received my twenty-dollar salary.</p>

<p>Special Issue on the Life of Female Workers Continued (Part 1)</p>
<p>Comment</p>
<h3>Those Teetering on the Brink of Death</h3>
<p>— Ms. Wenlan</p>
<p>In the eyes of the general public, female workers are considered to be engaged in a lowly occupation. However, when people sink below the hunger line, they have no choice but to have their children or wives engage in this kind of work that is considered lowly. In these metropolises where foreign capitalism has eroded to the very bottom, even this kind of occupation that is considered lowly has declared "no vacancy."</p>
<p>After the establishment of factory systems using machinery, family handicrafts were fundamentally bankrupted. As a result, women laborers engaged in family handicrafts had no choice but to quickly leave their homes and gather in specific places to carry out collective labor together. Once women's labor reaches this stage, they completely become free laborers, selling all of their labor to capitalists, even selling their bodies, minds, survival, and their entire lives. The entire history of women's labor in the past is filled with such tragic content.</p>
<p>When all sounds are silent and the earth is deeply immersed in the embrace of death, when those young masters and misses who have indulged in pleasure and are weary are drowsily embracing each other in pursuit of sweet dreams, these women laborers, carrying cold porridge and rice in their hands, supporting bodies exhausted by capitalist exploitation, and walking in uneven steps, leave their lovers in twos and threes, abandon their babies, and set off from the silent streets towards the factories. In those steam-filled, sultry rooms, many machines are turning ceaselessly day and night. The foul air and the clamor of the machines are already enough to bear. Yet, under relentless supervision, they still have to work desperately for eight, ten, twelve hours, creating unpaid surplus labor for the capitalists. Under such circumstances, their lives are simply worse than those of cattle and horses, because cattle and horses still have fresh air and free fields to breathe and enjoy. Therefore, their health deteriorates severely: lung disease, hunchback, and other conditions show a sharp increase. Moreover, because their living conditions are extremely poor, they completely lose the ability to resist disease, resulting in an alarmingly high mortality rate. As for education, they have never even dreamed of it. In this situation, morality and a sense of shame are secondary issues. Therefore, in many work areas, promiscuity and intermingling between men and women are undeniable facts. Finally, work is over. This group rests, and another group comes to work, laboring and exploiting endlessly until their remaining blood, sweat, and life are completely exploited by the capitalists, then they can only quietly await the arrival of death. How tragic and miserable are the women laborers who are constantly teetering on the brink of death!</p>
<p>In the current stage of the social system, the women's labor class, like other classes, is in opposition to the interests of capitalists. Therefore, if women laborers want to obtain their own liberation from the hands of capitalists, they must strive to awaken revolutionary consciousness. When this consciousness becomes widespread and deepened, then society will naturally reach its final form, which is a socialist society. In this society, there will be no one who labors without gain, and there will be no one who gains without labor. Everyone is a member of society who jointly produces and jointly consumes. Therefore, the current factory laws and worker regulations are merely incomplete measures that treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, and are still far from truly protecting the region of women's labor.</p>
<p>Mass Life</p>
<h3>Workshop and Toilet Room</h3>
<p>— Zhang Youmin</p>
<p>Female Workers in Silk Factories</p>
<p>Amidst rows and rows of silk machines and rows and rows of pots, there are crowded rows of female workers, their clothes thin, their hair and faces scorched yellow by the thick mist-like steam, sweat constantly flowing, and their hands operating non-stop. Their eyes are fixed on the cocoons on the porcelain eyelets, which they cannot leave for a moment; their noses smell the odor of silkworms, mixed with a kind of sour stench; as for what they hear, it is a cacophony of sounds filling their ears: the grinding of the silk machines, the clanging of copper keys, scolding, crying, the hungry cries of children under the carriages wanting milk, and the routine shouts of the supervisor, such as "(three new, four thin) (four new, three thin)". Imagine, under such living conditions, if ordinary people came to see, listen, or smell, how disgusted and uneasy they would feel (let alone the young masters, their footsteps would never descend). But for these women, driven by the need for bread, it seems that being able to do such things now is extremely fortunate.</p>
<p>From 5:30 in the morning, when the sky is just beginning to dawn, they are urged by the relentless echo of the factory's whistle to take their places on the small, hard benches to work. They have no time for washing or breakfast, and can only eat or wash while working. If there is any change in the porcelain eyelets, they will quickly put down their bowls or, with toothbrushes still stuck in their mouths, go to correct them. Sometimes, when the supervisor runs over and sees this, they are still a little scared.</p>
<p>The toilet room with its odor is their only happy place. Combing hair and applying powder are all done in this good place, especially during the scorching heat of June, when it is always crowded, seemingly as good a place to escape the summer heat as Moganshan. Unfortunately, time does not allow them to linger long in this cool realm, otherwise their work output will decrease. Although there are sometimes substitute workers who can take over, if they unfortunately produce thick or thin strands, then the soup-like scores still have to be eaten by them, and the supervisor's nagging still has to be endured by them.</p>
