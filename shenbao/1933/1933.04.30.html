<p>一面緩和青軍一面企圖逼康</p>
<p>汪精衛召劉文輝代表垂詢一切</p>
<p>（南京）藏兵越江侵犯傳說之由來、係西康駐軍極少、加之川軍内鬨、康防尤感空虚、而達賴亦有實現康藏合一之企圖、故乘此東北緊張新省事變之際、駐昌都藏兵另增二千人以上、配備軍事、隔金沙江而守之藏軍、亦時向康軍起釁、駐康境鄧蟠村旅見此情形、除電請川藏邊防司令劉文輝迅速增援外、並與青軍馬步芳取連絡形勢使青軍在玉樹青科防範、以</p>

<h3 id="c26">日軍退出灤東與我國之對策（下）明 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>對日政策之轉換</p>
<p>日本軍國主義者審知内外情勢。深悉拉長戰線之非計。故改變策略。隱藏其軍事上弱點。同時不以其所短來攻我國之所長。我國軍隊。固缺乏近代設備。立體戰爭。非所素習。惟有最後决戰。步兵所持武器。在訓練良好之部伍。類能發揮其狙擊效能。表現其人自爲戰之特性。設使日軍一味輕進。在我無全線總動員之整備。勝算誠不易操。然日欲如熱河全境之安然占領。亦屬必無之事。故日軍欲出最小之犧牲。以得最大之代價。祗有撤退灤東日軍。集其兵力於另一點上。以攻擊我方。且灤東日軍雖佯爲退兵。而南天門則攻擊頗急。一以窺察我國軍事内部是否整肅。再則僞證其保守長城之虚語爲不謬。以迷惑國際視聽。愚弄其國内人民。於是彼乃可以較小兵力。牽制我方沿灤河以迄於古北口巨大兵力之外。得抽調勁旅襲取張多。</p>
<p>察哈爾境内。不似熱河之險惡又乏能戰之精兵。孫殿英所部奔馳萬里。而據地扼守。非其所長。山西軍傅作義部。對内曾著功跡。亦屬小規模之戰鬭。匪但於國際戰爭未嘗具正確明悉之理解。即於今在正面敵人之日本帝國主義者。恐亦未有週密具體之認識。以之敵日。焉能期其必勝。</p>
<p>誠然處今日之勢。我國逼處劣敗地位。無可諱言。亦勿容諱言。但我國人耐苦勤勞。居當世第一。而煤·鐵·石油醖藏之豐富。僅次於北美。以此敵日。决無不可自救之理。况近代戰爭。最後勝負之决定。不在當前之軍器。而在其國家經濟之實力。日本自世界經濟恐慌發生以來。民力日就衰頽。二分之一以上之農村人口。幾全數陷於生活困難之悲境中。乃其軍閥竟借對外用兵以掩期醜惡。我國如眞能與之决死戰者。則最後勝敗之清算權。終當操諸吾人之手。故我國兵力雖弱。但能努力一撑持。必有轉敗爲勝之一日。雖然。制勝之道何在。吾人自救之道又安在哉。</p>
<p>第一。在發動整個的民族鬥爭。我國積弱已久。錮習過深。非有猛烈之剌激。勢難克服歷史傳來之惰性。頃者東北三省。旣被强奪。熱河一區。更遭蹂躪灤東五縣。幾完全在敵軍威脅之下。沿長城各要隘。多有敵騎踪跡。此種事變。匪特影響於政治。且直接威脅至於各個人之日常生活。熱血青年。早已憤恨塡胸。亟思發洩。即温厚穩重之流。亦莫不思有以報效國家。盡忠民族。爲今之計。允宜發動全中國民族。展開此非常時局面。不計一時成敗。確定對日鬥爭之根本方略。則瀕危之局。必可打開矣。</p>
<p>第二。積極培養農村與統制城市經濟。我國積弱之主要原因。政治未上軌道。不過上層機構之一種矛盾。其實根本錮疾。乃在於農業經濟衰微。商業資本。旣無轉化爲純粹資本主義經濟組織之可能。而新途徑又未開闢。遂外受列國商品與金融資本之極度壓迫。内感軍閥之無理蹂躪。今後轉換之機軸。培植農村生產。固爲要着。週轉農村金融。亦屬必需。尤有進者。非法之壓制。無理之剝削。一般苛捐雜稅。須即免除。拉夫派欵。尤應嚴禁。否則農村破壞。將愈不堪。民族前途之危機。愈益加甚也。一般城市（經濟）。屬於商業的轉販者居多。以產業爲中心者較少。然亦有若干地域。具近代產業之雛形者。當此展開非常局面之際。第一應有詳確週密之調查。第二應使各產業組織有非常時期之準備。第三應籌備戰時之統制。然後乃能集中國力。以與敵人爲長久之戰鬥也。</p>
<p>第三。非常時期之政治。必以大衆爲基礎。我國地域廣闊。而交通不便。欲令全國大衆。起而參與政治。誠非易事。然决不可因噎發食。置大衆勢力於不顧。　　例如日本軍閥。雖一意孤行。然必處處借大衆爲前題。利用（在鄕軍人會）爲骨幹。以激發其國民。煽動其侵略野心。否則猶不免於失敗。矧我國自北伐統一以來。政治思想。日趨發達。而大敵當前。設使政治上而無大衆作基礎者。對内且無出路。對外焉有辦法。故政權之開放。自屬當然。尤須維護勤苦大衆之利益。乃能收上下協同之效。副舉國一致之實。</p>
<p>上述三者。洵不免爲抽象的原則。然爲國人今日了低限度之要求。亦屬對日鬥爭所必具之條件。吾人獻其愚忱。惟望我全國大衆。共同努力以衝破當前之難關。整齊對日之戰線。</p>

<p>羅斯福宣言禁金出口、乃暫時救急辦法、然識者則料羅氏最終必採用放棄金本位政策、以爲調整美國經濟問題之工具、蓋不出此、則一切救濟法案、均難收切實效果、余以爲美國放棄金本位原因、第一在於提高物價、以解救其國内經濟問題、美國生產過剩、又因受各國高厚關稅及本位變更種種影響、存貨無法推銷、結果物價跌落　農村凋敝、工廠歇業、社會不安、國家稅收減少、預算不能平衡等等問題、相襲而來、故當前解救辦法、必須從提高物價做起、放棄金本位之後、卽可以通貨膨脹政策提高物價、又可以金價跌落手段剌激出口、國内產業失業財政諸種問題、便可相因而解、遠東市場向以英日美爲主要、但因日英相繼放棄金本位後美國遠東市塲大受打擊、日本一方利用日金跌價手段、繼續發展遠東市場、一方面又以貿易所得、用作侵華軍費、均於美國不利、美國乃不得不以經濟方法抑制日本之活動、因美金跌價之後、美貨便可重入遠東市塲、日貨一旦滯銷、其國内經濟組織、必生重大變化、此種經濟競爭、足以制日人之發展而有餘、此次羅斯福邀請英揆會譚、其目的想在求得英國之諒解、以共同之行動、對付此東亞侵略者之野心而已、此外再有一個原因、則爲民主黨政策的關係、吾人知道民主黨原以西南各省銀鑛主及農業家爲基礎、該黨多數希望銀價抬高原料品漲價、放棄金本位、即提高銀價與物價之捷徑羅氏此舉、至少有一部份用意、在於滿足其選民之渴望、以鞏固其將來之政治地位也、美國放棄金本位之原因、大槪如此、美國此舉所影響於我國者、第一可以增加國民之講買力、美金昻貴之時、定價美金一元之貨、須以四五元華幣、始能換得、以後或可以二三元華幣、即可買進、又美國書籍與機器、均爲我國所需要、跌價之後、於中國頗有裨益、第二可以增加國家稅收、我國購買力增加之後、對外貿易必可逐漸活躍、關稅亦隨之增加、惟此中害處亦大、第一我國乃入超國家、進口增加、足以阻碍國内產業界之發展、尤以銀行與工業資本家最蒙不利、其害一、第二中國產金、往年已經流出殆盡、現因銀價高漲、銀條繼之向外流出、最近上海外國銀行大批購買銀條、即其明證、長此推移、勢非中國現銀流盡不止、政府固可頒布嚴令、禁銀出口、但外債償付如何抵銷、現銀出口、恐終非律令所能禁止、結果中國或將被迫變成紙幣本位、國家萬一變化至此、其前途實有不忍言者、（二十九日專電）</p>

<p>▲國民二十八日日内瓦電　今日軍縮會議總委員會開會時、德代表那杜尼宣布德國對於軍縮之原則、那氏稱、德國所要求非他、即按照國聯會章第八條所規定之各國軍備、應減至可以担保普通安全之最低限度爲止而實行之、再則德國復應與他國在國土安全上享受同樣之權利與担保、此點則已經各國承認者云、英外相曾勸法國應稍忍耐、而加信任认軍縮會議之前途、那杜尼賞起謂惟德國始有竭力明白諒解對於意見之誠意、蓋德國至今日靜候十四年之久、以待各列强所應允軍縮計劃之完成、惟至今他國俱未有具體减縮軍備之事實、豈德國至此、尚可認爲無和衷共濟之觀念乎、且德國所要求之平等原則、本應即日施行、但但國已應允世界以一過渡時期、夫國聯會章第八條明明謂軍縮應立即完成、但德國亦已應允軍縮之逐步施行、故德國今日復根據公理與平等相爭、此實信任之根</p>
<p>本云、那屯繼即將德國對於英國建議所提出之諸保留案、逐條加以解釋、德國保留案之大意、較之英提議尤進一層、如侵略軍備軍用飛機等等、德國要求一槪廢上燬滅之、德國復接受五年過渡時期、惟</p>
<p>此後軍縮條約上德國所要求之平等地位、應在事實上成立、如他國對于某種軍備視爲國防上不可缺少者、同等軍備亦即不應對於德國獨靳而不予也、那氏將德國軍縮宗旨宣布後、德法代表間即相交換意見、惟態度皆甚堅决、法代表認德國若堅持此種主張、則其結果將爲擴張軍備而非減縮軍備、德國如堅持到底、則將來軍縮會議實永無成功之望云、那氏當即再行聲明、德國並無重張軍備之意、但對於國土之安全、不得不與他國有同等之担保云、德國代表之宣言以及宣言後之激烈爭辯、在國聯方面已發生一極深刻之印象、衆謂時至今日、各國對於德國所要求之諸點、已屆無再事違避之時期、而必須加以一種解决云、在英美兩國自其各個宣言上觀之、頗有採取共同行動之意、且極不贊成德法兩國之從事於舌戰也、</p>

<p>中國革命、現在正遭逢歷史的嚴重難關、自前歲九一八事變以來、整個民族的生死問題、便提出到每個國民的前面、最近、日本帝國主義在北方的殘酷進攻、更促進全國朝野一致的憤慨、就目前形勢而言、挽救中華民族垂危的命運、繫於整個民族的精誠團結有計劃的反抗帝國主義、而中國國民革命、亦必由此而澈底完成、這是無可爭辯的原則、但是正值抗日戰爭的發展中、中國共產黨的政策、恰恰與此相反、使政府受着重大的牽制、基於這一現實的重大事件、加以我在長時間深刻考慮的結果、我深信第三國際、現所領導的中國共產黨、絶對不能担負中國革命的任務反而成爲中國革命的障碍、中國革命的完成、只有依賴三民主義的指示、及中國國民黨的領導、才能實現、因此我現在毅然决然宣布脫離中國共產黨、抛去我以前的政治偏見、承認我過去所做的一切錯誤、並且勇敢的轉變到三民主義旗幟之下、作一個反共抗日完成國民革命的戰鬥員、現在將我轉變的過程簡要叙述如次、當社會主義輸入中國的初期、我卽開始研究社會主義、隨後經李守常的介紹、在北京加入中國共產黨、先後參加學生與工人間的活動、數年之間、歷經担任支部區委省委中央等部的工作、這個時候、我憑着單純的信仰、及世界革命熱烈的期待、努力爲共產主義工作、經常是站在爭鬥的最前綫、國共合作問題發生、中國共產黨内部發生了劇烈的爭執、此時、我一度參加國民黨工作、對於「共產革命與國民革命」的理論、發生過很大的動搖、一九二七年、中國共產黨失敗後、採用無政府主義的暴動政策、殺人放火熼兒戲革命、造恩滔天的罪惡、我當時卽認爲中國共產黨的路綫、（其實也就是第三國際路綫）已完全離開中國的實際要求、與民衆利益背道而馳、因嚴厲批評這種荒謬政策的結果、被共黨中央予以種種誣辱、在共黨六次大會、共產黨的暴動政策、又假立三路綫的形式復活起來、我亦因繼續反抗、而遭受他們的打擊、一九三○年、共黨舉行四中全會、我與徐錫根·王克全·孫正一·諸人起而反對、組織非常委員會、因反抗失敗、被</p>
<p>共黨開除黨籍、自是以後、我對於政治、遂由</p>
<p>失望而消極、但是我仍保留萬一的希望、希望共產黨更能發現正確的路綫、解决中國革命問題、隨後此希望亦漸歸消失、當非常委員會解散、及其後再圖規復之時、我在政治上是萬分的非觀與苦悶、政治生活婙於停頓、但却因此開始思考種種革命根本問題、就現在看來、我歷年來在政治上與組織上、旣然窺破第三國際及其所領導的中國共產黨行動、完全與中國革命不相適應、旣然明白了目前中國外侮内憂紛至沓來、民衆水深火熱中國、共產黨負有重大責任、當此之時、我不能根本與之决絶、仍然想在錯誤影響下面、謀圖補救、這不僅是個人的主觀錯誤而且昧於客觀的眞理、這一錯誤、我現在是勇敢承認的、并且願意把他最重要數點揭發出來、第一、中國是次殖民地國家、中國經濟長期在國際資本主義控制之下、没有形成有力的民族資本、根本上没有構成共產主義的集體生產條件、因此中國革命的性質、主要是對内肅清封建殘餘、對外驅逐帝國主義在華的勢力、才能發展經濟、安定民生、同時中國革命的動力、應該是聯合各階級力量、共同奮鬥、才能排除强敵、完成任務、但是共產黨却根據第三國際錯誤的估計、抹煞一切客觀事實、武斷的作建立蘇維埃政權的號召、否認無產階級以外革命勢力的存在、這樣搬演外來的超事實的理論、結果所謂蘇維埃政權的建立、只是造成農村中廣大的屠殺、死亡災荒與破產、城市區域罷工門爭武裝暴動的發動、更陷勞苦羣衆於同樣的悲運、這種基本錯誤、自然是造成其他一切罪惡的張本、而形成國内的反動的主要潮流、第二、中國共產黨的政策、一切直接出於第三國際、但就過去事實觀察、第三國際、對於中國問題的謬誤、已如前述、而其在策略上、朝三暮四、前後矛盾、尤屬指不勝屈、中國共產黨幾次「機會主義」的表演、均以</p>
<p>第三國際的派别爲背影、而彼更每次卸其責于中國共產黨個人、助長共黨内部的紛爭、以資其操縱、同時第三國際自一九一八年以來、等候西歐無產階級革命的援助失望後、一切對外政策、轉以擁護蘇聯爲中心、因是而勾結法日、進兵中東路、其所謂援助弱小民族、進行世界革命、不過成爲一個好聽的名詞、中國革命、在第三國際指示與欺騙之下、遂簡單成爲擁護蘇聯的犧牲品、第三、中國共產黨的愚昧的理論、及其所禀承的自私的狂妄的第三國際政策、經十餘年事實來重複的證明、是斷定其决不胡成爲「無產階級政黨」的、因此共產黨經常好像建設在沙堆上一樣、他的基礎是完全空虚流盪的、旣没有多數民衆的擁護、更根本說不上是革命的先鋒隊伍、相反的、眞正革命份子、現在是日益敵視他離開他、只有少數黨官之徒、還在虚設機關、希圖在這個廢墟上建立甚麽基礎、這不過是自欺欺人罷了、最後是只有歸于毁滅的、第四、中國共產黨狂妄的理論與畸形的組織、不用說在正確革命的道路發展中、是必然要被埋没的、但是在今天仍然却積極盡其反革命的能事在全國經濟的恐慌中、在困難重重包圍中、他們最賣力的、就是在匪區内東西馳突、牽制政府的抗日兵力、以遂其狹隘的私圖、在一切的農村中釀成變亂、趁火打刦、在生產界製成騷擾妨害生產、增加失業、凡此一切、在今日均可解釋爲仇視民族反帝戰綫的媚外行爲、但是他們却用種種藉口把這一切媚外行爲、轉以誣蔑執政的國民黨、根據上述數點、克認爲第一國際與中國共產黨、在中國革命史客觀上、是反動的集團、我過去參加這一集團的言論與行動、嚴格的批判起來、自然我的罪戾、我更痛惜、多數青年、近年來因迷失了政治方向、在錯誤百出的中國共產黨領導之下、受了同樣的待遇、而且造成巨大的犧牲、這樣、經過深長的考慮與國民黨當局剴切的說明、我今日是完全是從共產黨的污泥中振拔出來、</p>
<p>我正確了解三民主義、有切合今日中國實際政治的行動政綱、兼有崇高偉大的目的與理想、執政的國民黨、在中國革命中有光勞的歷史、現爲廣大的羣衆所擁護、今日中國的緊要政治問題、就是在國民黨政府領導之下、堅决抗日剿共、開闢民族的新路、調和階級矛盾代替暴亂與恐怖、實施計劃經濟改良農村生活、建立民治民有民享的新國家、羅章　、四月廿八日、</p>

<p>我在討論本問題前，有幾句極誠懇的話來正告讀者，我狠不贊成用譏諷刻薄的語氣來攻擊任何投稿的人，徒然耗費了篇幅，結果是一無所得，這不是申報創設讀者顧問的本意，所以我不但不用報復手段來攻擊十餘日來譏笑唾駡我文章的人、並且勸讀者尤其是劉思明君，要持重的討論及發表各　人的意見，</p>
<p>諸片要明瞭讀者顧問公開的討論，好比是一個圓桌會議，申報是主席，我們都是出席討論這「農村回得去嗎」問題的會員，一定要在本問題内切實的討論，方始可以得到一個結果，這是雄聲君所盻望的，也是讀者所希望的，否則離題太遠，將使各人無從討論，我們是申報請來的客人，說話也應當客氣一些，方不失學者的態度，申報假我們篇幅，我們應當善用機會，儘量發揮，因爲我認定目前的農村問題的確是中國一個重大問題，值得我們用細針密縫的方法來討論，所以我贊成讀者放棄小節，在大處用力，我的主張在本問題内，至少應有兩種觀察，（一）如何解决若雄聲君所問的入農村後的個人生活問題，（二）如何解决全國整個的農村問題，第一個問題已經在四月五日答復過雄聲君，至於第二個問題，請再略作討論與說明，</p>
<p>我在十餘天内讀了十幾篇文章，對於贊成「農村裏加得去嗎」是可稱極少數，有的是以爲農村中充滿了帝國主義的侵略，盜賊兵匪，土豪劣紳，重利盤剝，苛捐雜稅，農村中幾乎一日不可居，失　的人望都市中來謀生，農村破產了，所以若要回農村去，必須要將這畸形社會情形根本的改造不可，所以帝國主義不打倒，資本主義不推翻以前，卽使農村發達到美國一樣，亦不過像美國一樣的感受到普遍的經濟恐慌而已，有何好處之可言，這是像劉思民君朱嬰君等所主的議論，你要曉得，中國幅員的廣大，决不能以一時一地的特殊情形就說全國都是如此，農民的貧窮，不自今日始，至於說農民全部破產的話，恐怕亦言之過甚，帝國主義的侵略，天然是都市中感受到最利害，决不是鄕村，農村中雖有匪盜，但是都市的綁匪盜賊要凶得多，農村中果然有土豪劣紳的蹂躪，但是都市中的客豪奸商的作惡殺人，恐怕也要</p>
<p>利害得多，農村中的重利盤剝，還比不上都市中高價房租的利害，農村中的苛捐雜稅，我不信還比都市中的印花，營業、進出口、房捐、車捐、牌照捐、重重疊疊數不勝數捐稅來得多麽，若說農村中失業的人都跑到都市中來，不是事實，即拿上海而論，尚不到全國人士百份之一的數目，到上海來發財，我到相信，說因爲失而來上海謀生，恐怕未必，所以我說到都市中來的人，除了勞工的確從農村中來的以外，其餘從城鎭中來的人，也不過兩等，一是内地的資本家，一是内的流氓，都是因爲要比在内地容易發財，所以我們與其說從帝國主義的侵入農村而使農村破產，不如說外國農村科學化，產生的農產品奪取了中國農民的市塲，使中國的農村破產，農民窮乏來得合理，帝國主義的利用科學的利器，暗暗殘殺我們的同胞，的確是可怕，你看美棉比我長而好，多而賤，所以國人的紗廠要買美棉而不買國棉，美麥比我大而白，多而賤，所以國人的粉廠要買美麥而不買國麥，暹米比我好而賤，所以我國的食糧商要買暹米而不買國米來補不足，中國的絲，不如日本絲的好，所以美國買日本的絲不買中國絲，茶的市塲是被日本印度奪了大半，桐油因爲中國商人好攙雜油，所以美國已在南方植種桐樹，所以中國再不在農村敎育上謀根本的提高農民智識，與在農工實業上求重要的科學改造，中國農民無論如何動勞，無論若何節儉，萬萬不能與外國科學昌明的農業來競爭，祇有一日一日的失敗海汰而已，我看透這個危險，所以我高呼着提倡一種農村敎育救國的論說，（印有單行本一萬份分贈全國請附郵一分仍可寄奉）我並不反對政府軍人抗日衛國的工作，然我不主張像劉思民君那樣奮激全國動員的赴前敵抗日，我的主張，一方面儘管奮勇抗日，一方面國民也做些下層工作，這下層工作，就是智識階級來服務農村，在敎育上，農業</p>
<p>上，社會工作上，來建設，因爲我們至多數百萬人，在都市中呐喊，倘然離開了這數萬萬農民單獨來做這建設與抗日的工作，力量究屬有限，所以我的農村敎育救國論宗旨，就是如此末了，我在這一月内，接到各方各處來的函件，有百餘通之多，（内有三信，從江西寄來，都要回到鄕村中去，足以證明農村回不去不是事實，）我讀了以後，幾乎要使我落下淚來，因爲來函中的一種忠實誠懇的態度，赤心報國的熱忱，眞切的求知心與純樸的向上心，均足使我萬分的感佩，更覺中國前途有希望，我們有良心的人，更應當加倍努力於救國的工作，我很願意於可能的範圍内，每星期費幾個鐘頭，替欲回農村中去的同志來討論，及已在農村中服務的同志來通信，所有函件，當逐一答復，我還要介紹幾個在中國農村中服務而已有相當之成績的機關，一是山京鄒平縣的鄕村建設研究院，（係梁漱溟先生主辦）一是河北定縣的平敎會，（係晏陽初君主辦）還有華洋義振會在河北各縣及金陵大學在烏江所辦的農村事業，均有相當成績，倘然中國各省各縣都能仿效實行，農村前途，就有希望，（本問題討論結束），</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>或問：吴諺稱小孩，呌做小干，干字怎解？我說：小干便是小哥，哥與干本是一聲之轉，容易誤讀。舉一個證據，吴人稱一個子，呌做一干子，那麽，吴人稱小哥，呌做小干，正是同式的的比例，毫不足異。或問：小干便是小哥，固然不錯；但是，有時吴人稱小孩，呌做小干㕶，這個㕶字，怎解？我說：小干㕶便是小哥兒；兒字在杭州人口中是很多的，吴人不慣作捲舌音，所以說到小哥兒，哥字旣讀作干字，語尾的兒字，便讀作鼻音的㕶字。—　—㕶字如英文N字母的收音。</p>
<p>或問：吴諺中的兒字，往往讀作妮字，如兒子讀作妮字之類；照此類推，那麽小哥兒應讀作小妮干，不該讀作小干㕶了。我說：吴人讀兒字，有兩種讀法；兒字作兒子解，便讀作㕶字。兒字放在語尾，並無意義，那麽兒字便不讀作㕶字，而讀作鼻音的㕶字了。</p>
<p>或問：你可有證據，把來證明語尾的兒字吴人都讀作㕶字麽？我說：當然可以，不過其例不多罷了。爲什麽呢？只爲吴人的語尾字，往往不喜用兒字，而喜用子字，譬如帽兒，鞋兒，杯兒，盆兒，吴人只說帽子，鞋子，杯子，盆子，而避去這個捲舌音的兒字。但是，有時無可避免，便只好把兒字讀作㕶字了。舉三個例，吴人稱襖兒，呌做襖㕶，稱筷兒，呌做筷㕶；還有討趣兒呌做討趣㕶；那麽吴人稱小哥兒，呌做小干㕶，正是同式的比例，毫不足異。</p>
<p>旣然知道小干便是小哥兒，那麽，小　㕶便是小娘兒，可以類推，不須贅解了。</p>
<h3 id="c227">不能披露的消息 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 張眞相</p>
<p>丨好比春色滿園關不住丨</p>
<p>一般人總以爲新聞記者是天下最不能嚴守秘密的人物，所以要有什麽秘密消息就深恐被新聞記者曉得。在可能的範圍以内，總要設法瞞過記者的耳目。萬一不能做到，事實竟無法隱瞞時，更不惜威逼利誘，或婉轉情商，拿出最後的手段來，非要達到報紙上不披露之目的不可。其實「天下事要得人不知，除非己莫爲」；這是一句顚撲不破的眞理。這一個地方這幾種報紙，雖可設法不登載，却保不住在另一個地方。另有其他種種報紙，肆無忌憚的任意宣揚啊！試看中國報紙所不能披露的消息，不是外國報紙往往不登特登嗎？每每愈是有人要秘密的消息，愈就引起他人的好奇心，促動人們的注意力，畢竟是隱蓋不住，掩蔽不了。這正好比「滿園春色關不住，一枝紅杏出牆來」，一個道理。</p>
<p>紅杏除非不曾接觸過春風，若是旣經　度春風，而仍望其保存舊態，不發生變化，不引人注目，那簡直是不合情理的夢想！縱是你可以設法將園牆加高，不準任何枝幹向牆外發展，不得絲毫洩漏春光；然而關不住的春風，終是「偷香有術」。誰能阻止春風不與紅杏發生關係？誰能否認花香不能由春風帶出園</p>
<p>外？</p>
<p>過去好像有一位要人說過：「我們的好事多磨，春光大半爲新聞記者所洩漏」！照那發言人的意見，記者成爲當代魔鬼之一，恨不得來一個一網打盡才有「玉成」所謂「好事」的希望。其實，誰是魔鬼？誰非魔鬼？若是魔鬼自己不曾用鏡子照過自己面孔，又那能分辨得清楚呢？若要紅杏不爲牆外人看見，那除非紅杏本身不與春風新密不爲功！俗語說「好事不瞞人，瞞人非好事」。紅杏與春風間的關係，旣已成爲公開的秘密，那就不必再來掩蓋。若是紅杏本身有怕人的必要，那麽眞正的魔鬼，我們可以大膽的說，不是他人，却是紅杏自己了！</p>

<p>— 忠煥</p>
<p>近年上海最時髦的口號，無論到什麽地方，都可以聽得到的，是「不要</p>
<p>放在心上」。如勞工的神聖們說「工作不要放在心上」，商店的店員們說「生意不要放在心上」，學校的般一一學子們，說「功</p>
<p>課不要放在心上」，我國民對於應盡的義務，一切的一切，大家都嚷着不要放在心上，然而回憶到「九一八」以來，我國政府一再詔告我人「長期抵抗」，無奈我軍不戰而退，目覩錦繡山河，遭敵人奪去，平津岌岌，幾將不保，苛捐雜稅</p>
<p>，抽來的金錢，豢養他們，保以他們喪心病狂，忍將幾千萬里富藏的「東北」放棄呢？我想他們大槪也在那兒嚷着「關外失了，不要放在心上」，將來「黄河失了，還是不要放在心上」，就是長江，珠江的流域，一齊都失了，大家仍來喊一句「不要放在心上」。唉！做了「亡國奴，也不要放在心上」！</p>

<p>這是一個雨天，馬路上行人稍少；但是在兩旁的行人道上，即愈見</p>
<p>其擠。</p>
<p>馬路轉角處，一條小衖的門口，許多人圍作一團在那裏瞧熱鬧。</p>
<p>這兒是雨所落不到的地方，所以更多：把他們分析開來：一大半是閒人，一小半是有不要緊事情的人；我也是其中的一個。</p>
<p>外面的人圈子雖很大，但裏面的範圍却很小：只有一塊直徑六七尺的空地，主角是兩個小孩子。</p>
<p>一條二三尺長很污穢的土布，鋪在這空地上；上面覆了二隻碗；另外還有三個紅布結子。</p>
<p>兩個小孩子，便坐在這土布的後面。一個八九歲大些的孩子，把紅布結子很巧妙的在碗下面變來變去；其餘的一個，年歲更小，不過七歲光景，也拿了一面銅鑼，「噹噹噹」的敲着。</p>
<p>銅鑼的聲音，把外面走路的人都引攏來；三個紅布結子的小戲法，便能夠暫時的吸住看客。他們二人年紀雖小，然已經懂得合作的精神了。</p>
<p>忽然，鑼聲停止了，戲法也告完了；那小的走出兩步，在空地上接連着翻筋斗。時候雖說是春季了；但天氣還很冷，而他們身上祇穿了一件很薄的布衫，下面也是短得在膝蓋以上的短褲。</p>
<p>一會兒，大的也出來了。他們兩人你抱着我，我抱着你的互相連絡着翻。觀客們有幾個贊嘆着說：「賺幾文錢眞不容易，你看他們是多麽的用力啊」！</p>
<p>又是一會兒，小的把身子盤做一團，那大的便站到他的肚皮上去。旁邊的幾位看白戲老顧客、早已都悄悄的溜之大</p>
<p>吉；待至那大的孩子開口要錢時，只不過寥寥的幾個人了！</p>
<p>有幾個擲下了幾文，便走了，而我却還站在一旁；突然，一個巡捕走來，惡狠狠地把他們趕走了。</p>
<p>細雨已經停止，天光比剛才亮得多了。我惘然的在路上行着，心中若有所失；一種帶着孤苦姜凉的鑼聲，依稀地仍舊盤據在我的心坎上。</p>

<p>只是如此一來，却惹起了江氏一肚皮的心事，又沏了一壺茶，靠了火爐子邊下坐着，一個人慢慢的咀嚼着雜𢪧兒。他也不知道靜坐了多久，姑娘已經是睡覺了，他想了許久，又看看坑上躺着的姑娘，心想像趙連長這樣的人才，不能算壞，不懂我們姑娘是什麽意思，總不願意攀這頭親。以前可以說爲了甘二爺的原故，他不願意别人。現在他和甘二爺算是翻了臉了，爲什麽還是這樣不肯嫁趙連長呢？江氏靜靜的想了半夜，得不着一個結論。但是他愛惜趙連長的意思，却爲着這個更進了一步。到了次日元旦，他就加倍的注意着趙自强回來没有。然而候了一天，也不見他的聲影。到初二，自己還不曾起床，却聽到他在窗子外嚷道：楊老太起來了嗎？我這兒跟你拜年來了。江氏笑着連道：不敢當，不敢當，我一會子就來跟你拜年。於是趙自强就走了。江氏受了他這一聲拜年，也不知高興從何而起，立刻披衣下坑，怱怱的洗過臉，梳了一把頭，就跟着到裏面院子裏來。只見趙翁屋子裏，有兩個穿軍衣的人坐在那裏。江氏雖然認得趙自强，然而見了軍人，總有些害怕，因之站在門口，向後縮了兩步。趙自强就搶上前介紹着道：這是殷連長，這是田連長，都是我的把子。那兩個連長都站起來行禮。江氏看到人家有客，不便久坐，站着向趙翁說了一聲拜年，也就走了，這個殷連長名得仁，便笑着道：怪不得自强說這位老太人好，你看他那臉上，都是一臉慈善相。那田連長單名一個青字，是個二十有零的青年。他的軍衣，穿的格外整齊，一點皺紋没有。一雙裹肚緊緊的纏着，如貼在脚肚上一般，一雙黄皮鞋，不帶着一點灰塵，只看好軍衣口袋上，揷了一枝自來水筆，便在衣冠上，表示出他武人的文明來。（五七）</p>

<h3 id="c236">再談「回農村去」 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 玄</p>
<p>對於曹聚仁先生「主張回農村去」的議論，我同意於楊幸之先生的駁詰。現在我再說幾句話。</p>
<p>曹先生把中國農村分爲三種方式、我覺得非常奇怪。楊先生已經指出了曹先生還錯誤在於「硬戕整個資本主義世界、整個殖民地，整個處於崩潰過程中的農村分割成不相聯擊的似乎可以獨立的二種地域，：：：」可是我覺得就使退一步斷章取義來考查曹先生那種說法，也令人不解。</p>
<p>第一，曹先生說河南陜西一帶早已成爲「無農之村。」這裏的「農」字，不知是指「農民」呢，抑是指「農事？」據曹先生所說「縣長勒令種烟，交不出烟捐便打屁股，」則他所謂「無農」實乃農民不能種出，而不是没有農民。而曹先生遂下結論曰：「這種無農之村，當然無從回去。」這就是說：不能務農，回去做甚！但是曹先生不又主張到丙種農村去「組織自耕農作自衛戰」麽？旣然可以到丙種農村作「自衛戰，」爲什麽又是「當然無從回」到甲種的所謂「無農之村？」難道河南陜西的有田不得種稻的農民眞是該死的麽？</p>
<p>第二，曹先生以爲江浙湘皖一帶，資本主義吃大地主，大地主吃佃農，這種「臨於潰滅的農村，也還無法回去。」在這裏，曹先生所謂「臨於潰滅的農村」一語又很含糊。若說是「農村經濟」臨於潰滅麽？則「資本主義吃大地主，大地主吃佃農」的結果不一定是「農村經濟」潰滅，却是自耕農淪爲農奴。曹先生的意思或卽在此，所以他就一貫的把對付甲種農村的眼光再對付此乙種農村：「也還無法回去！」</p>
<p>因此他以爲就只有丙種農村值得或「有法」回去了。因爲那是自耕農爲中心，而且「卽不鬭爭也可以取勝。」然而，這是怎樣的「烏托邦」的理論！然而同時我們也可知道曹先生之覺得甲乙兩種農村「無從回去」因爲那兩種農村裏没有自耕農而且紳士痞棍之力很强。想把自耕農作爲農村中抵抗惡勢力的基本力量，這也是曹先生的認識錯誤。</p>
<p>本來我上次發表的短文只就影片城市之夜等等三種「回到農村去」的呼聲，加以消極的質問，我並不是主張不要回農村去。至於回農村去幹什麽，說來話長，今天只好不討論了。</p>
<h3 id="c237">回農村去做這個！ <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>丨答楊幸之先生丨</p>
<p>現在甚囂塵上的回農村問題，的確含有Ｕｔｏｐｉａ的氣味甚重。我的主張回農村去，可是和做烏託邦夢的並不相同。我自己是小農民，我只想喚醒從農村來的青年回農村去；前文所說，只證明尚有農村可回，並非說非大家回農村不可。</p>
<p>在我們這些小農民看來，那些高喊回農村的朋友，十有九是不敢「勞駕」的。他們到我們農村去做什麽？會喂牛嗎？會割草嗎？連牽牛割草都不會的朋友，到農村中去做什麽？若說回去做紳士，那還是請在上海「打打麻將」，「狂狂紅妝」塡塡解放詞」罷！老實說，在上海受大學敎育的青年，誰也不配回農村去！民國九年，北京潮起一種工讀互助團的烏托邦，天津濟南上海杭州跟着有這種組織：不久，這個美麗的肥皂泡吹破了，什麽也没有了！若厭倦了都市生活，想到農村去過桃源生活，其滑稽可笑當然會和工讀互助團一樣的。</p>
<p>然而我們非回農村不可，又是當前的切要問題。資本主義的嘴巴，正想張開來呑没自耕農，（請參看申報四月二十七日，東台縣裕華墾植公司佃農一千餘户泣告黨政各機關各團體書。）我們急要喚醒自耕農，拒絶他們的投資。我們來組織生產消費合作社，替自耕農改良農具種籽推銷農產物；再進一步，普及農民敎育，嚴密農民組織，參加新社會的基礎工作。中國現有的自耕農，至少在千萬户以上，這不是一個可輕視的數目，更不是一個可輕視的力量；所以我說，我們回農村去不會十分失望的。</p>
<p>不過回農村去的青年，必得具備三種資格：甲，農民出身，没有做小地主或大地主的野心：乙，熟習新農具技術，能夠和自耕農一同下田工作；丙，終身服務，不作奪取政權想。最要緊的，還是要有一個堅固的團體。（個人是没有力量的）</p>
<p>中國歷來的社會運動，都只是表面的口號的運動，從來不曾到民間去，沙灘上的屋子，經得起一陣風浪嗎？我現在所希望的，大家反其道而行，不汲汲於求速效，埋着頭專做地下運動，且看十年二十年後，我們的成績怎樣？這種工作，我名之曰「種樹運動」，丨只替後人種樹，不想自己乘凉的運動。</p>
<p>編者按：「回農村去」一問題，在本報讀者顧問欄討論了很久，到現在還没有結束。本刊日前發表玄，楊兩先生的文章後，引出曹先生的辯答，日來收到關於此一問題之投稿甚多，大有擴大戰線之勢。但本刊篇幅有限，專門問題之討論，實未便多所刊載。兹將代表兩派意見之玄，曹兩先生之文章登出，就此作一結束。</p>
<h3 id="c238">殤兒 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 恩蘋</p>
<p>春天裏一所兒天朗氣清，一忽兒又雨絲風片，眞是一年四季中冷熱最不一定的時節。就在這樣造物弄人的天時中，活潑可愛的潔蘋以小小年紀天殤了。到今年五月十二日，蘋兒同我永訣忽忽一個週年。她死去的時候不過兩歲零兩個月二十天，可是她在這短促的生命中間，聽見了中日戰爭裏的槍砲聲，看見了敵軍轟炸機成羣結隊的飛翔進攻，又看見了閘北方面整天整夜燒不息的熊熊大光。她曾經跟着她的母親乘蘇州河的内河輪船避亂回鄕，她又跟着母親乘長江輪船回到上海。她回滬三天就生病。記得去年二五五紀念」的日子，淞滬停戰恊定簽字，那時也像今年春天一樣地忽熱忽冷。那時她的病雖是好了，但還没有完全恢復健康，因之就因一夜的突然寒冷着了凉，她脆弱的小體又發起寒熱來了，病勢就此一天一天的沉重下去。送到廣仁醫院之後，她從慢性肺炎變成急性肺炎，臥病醫院不過三天就夭殤了，這是我第一次感覺死的恐怖，死的殘酷！那三天裏她纏綿病榻一種說不出的痛苦，我深深地印在心頭，永遠不會忘記。</p>
<p>自從蘋兒死後，我就痛感着人生的寂寞和孤獨，無法塡補。久居在上海都市裏的人不大容易聽到杜鵑的啼聲的，即使偶然聽到，也不大容易引起特别的感想。不知怎的，我自蘋兒天殤後，老是聽到杜鵑渺茫地飄忽地在天空中尖銳地悲慘地啼個不住，從暮春到秋初，差不多天天聽到「哭咕，哭咕，」的啼聲，晴天聽到，雨天也聽到，因此我就幻想着，這或許是蘋兒的精靈，失了倚附的精靈。我有時走上陽臺，凝着神聽，循着聲聽，並翹着探望探望。有時聽去好像不遠，好像就在鄰家花園裏綠油油的樹枝上；有時又像是很遠，像在澄碧的天空裏。我回想到我童年時代跟着祖母鄕居，我的八弟在二三歲的時候死了；我在夢中似的突然見着小小靈柩抬到鄕下祖瑩安葬，那時我也聽得「哥哥歸去」，「哥哥歸去」的啼聲，我眞想不到在上海也會聽到二十年前在鄕間聽到的杜鵑的悲啼！</p>
<h3 id="c239">高爾斯華綏的筆耕收穫 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 歌川</p>
<p>靠着一枝秃筆營生的世界文學家中聽說在不多時以前到過中國的蕭伯納的收入爲最多。但我們試調查一下新死的英國文壇的宿將高爾斯華綏，便知道他的筆耕收穫，也就很有可觀。據最近發表的數目，從他四十五六歲起直到六十六歲這二十年間，每年收入小說，戲曲的版稅，及戲曲的表演費，總在一萬五千鎊到二萬鎊之間，再加上他在英美各地的報紙雜誌上所投短文雜感的稿費，總共實有五萬鎊之多，合着上說的版稅等，每年的總收入約計七萬鎊。每鎊姑作爲上海流通幣二十元計算罷，也就有一百四十萬元！</p>
<p>他成名以後的收入旣有如此之多，他那成名之作，當然是很銷行的了。試看他的代表作，即福賽德家傳（Ｔｈｅ　Ｆｏｒｓｙｔｅ　Ｓａｇａ）的第一篇有錢的人　Ｔｈｅ　Ｍｅｎ。（Ｆｒｏｐｅｒｔｙ）在一九零六年出版的時候，單只在英蘭本土，不多久就賣完了十萬册。當時，著者所拿的版稅是百分之七，所以單從這一册書，也就拿到七千鎊的版稅。至於整個福賽德家傳，在英國銷了二十五萬部，在美國，德國及斯干諦納維亞一帶，合計也賣去五十萬部，其收入自然可想見了。</p>
<p>他到了六十歲的時候，還是精神攫礫，不斷地埋頭寫文章，現在把他在六十二歲的誕辰所寫的幾句話，譯在這兒，作個尾巴：「我之所以比那些老頭兒似乎年輕些，就是因爲我每天實行騎馬，拍網球，打高爾夫球，等等運動。我的信條是健康第一。我近來做東西的習慣，是午前寫小說，午後寫戲曲，晚上絶對不寫」。</p>
<h3 id="c240">紅蘿蔔鬚 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Ｊｕｌｅｓ　Ｒｅｎａｒｄ作　林取譯</p>
<p>鶴嘴鋤</p>
<p>大哥斐利克斯和紅蘿蔔鬚並立工作着。每個人手裏拿着一把鶴嘴鋤。大哥斐利克斯的鶴嘴鋤是呌蹄鐵匠照着尺寸用鐵做的。紅蘿蔔鬚的則是自己用木做的。他們在從事園藝，迅捷地工作着，看那生個熱心。突然，當紅蘿蔔鬚毫没有提防的時候（一切不幸總是恰恰在這時候降臨的），他的額上着了一鋤。</p>
<p>片刻之後，大家便把大哥斐利克斯抬進去，狠留心地把他安放在床上，因爲他看到小弟弟流血，嚇暈了。一家子都圍在那裏，用脚尖走着路，歎息着，躭心着。</p>
<p>「鹽在什麽地方？」</p>
<p>「請你拿一點冷水來，把他的太陽穴弄濕一下。」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚爬上一把椅子，在人業中，由别人的肩上探望着。他的額上包着一塊布，已經染紅了，血浸在布上並且散開來。</p>
<p>雷辟克對他說道：</p>
<p>「你得着好報應了啦！」</p>
<p>給他包紥傷口的姐姐愛勒絲丁接着說：</p>
<p>「這眞像在牛油裏面挖了一下一樣呢。」</p>
<p>他不曾呌喊，因爲他根據經騐，知道呌喊是毫没有用處的。</p>
<p>可是這時大哥斐利克斯睜開一隻眼睛了，隨後又睜開了另一隻，他現在不害怕了，他的臉色也漸漸回過來了，於是大家都放心了。</p>
<p>「總是這樣的！」電辟克家的對紅鬚蔔鬚說：「你就不能當心一點嗎，蠢東西！」</p>
<p>獵槍</p>
<p>雷辟克對他兩個兒子說：</p>
<p>「你們兩個人有一支獵槍就夠了。友愛的兄弟是一切都可以共的。」</p>
<p>「對啦，爸爸，」大哥斐利克斯回答，「我們兩個人可以共一支獵槍。並且祇要紅蘿蔔鬚有時借給我用一用就够了。」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚旣不說可，也不說否，他知道這是靠不住的。</p>
<p>雷辟克把獵槍從綠色的槍鞘裏面抽出來問道；</p>
<p>「你們兩個人裏面那一個先拿？這似乎是應當由年長的先拿呢。」</p>
<p>「我願意把這光榮讓給紅蘿蔔鬚。由他先拿罷！」大哥斐利克斯說。</p>
<p>「斐利克斯，你今天的舉止狠客氣，這，我不會忘記的。」雷辟克說。</p>
<p>雷辟克便將獵槍擱在紅蘿蔔鬚的肩上。</p>
<p>「走罷，你們好好去頑，不要爭吵。」</p>
<p>「我們不要帶狗去嗎？」紅蘿蔔鬚問。</p>
<p>「用不着。你們自己可以輪流做狗。並且，像你們這樣的獵人，不會打傷，祇會打死的。」</p>

<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3 id="c270">進一步討論中國的病根問題 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>自從中國病根的所在的問題在前兩期漫談裏發表後，就有許多讀者來信，提出疑問，要求作更詳細一點的說明與解釋，來信的内容約分爲兩類：</p>
<p>（一）制度爲什麽破產，文化爲什麽消失？</p>
<p>（二）急切的要知道補救的方法和進行的步驟。</p>
<p>關於第一類的問題，詳細解釋起來，要包括古今的中國歷史，實非本刊的篇幅所能允許，恰巧我們接到一位湼之君的來稿，内中有一段說明，很可作爲我們解釋第一類問題的扼要回答，其内容是：「目前的中國，是次殖民地的中國，是經濟落後的中國。外困於國際資本帝國主義的桎梏，内復遭受軍閥官僚的蹂躪，如民族經濟的無以發展，全由於海關，礦山，工廠，金融，交通等國家命脈，都直接或間接的操縱於帝國主義之手的緣故；而内部經濟組織崩潰，正爲軍閥官僚不時發動内戰，自由增加苛捐雜稅和發行公債，勒種鴉片等等肥私的行爲所致。在這種百孔千瘡的環境中，欲求中國民族解放運動之成功，决不是少數高等華人全體保爵之徒所能實現的「血購」的偉業；而且他們爲了全體保爵之故，對於素被蹂躪的下層人民之奮起，且加以壓力，似乎必至全數撲滅而後已！事實勝於雄辯，自滿清政府至北洋軍閥，進而至於現在，已有一貫的體系解答了「寗贈朋友，不給家奴」之啞謎！於是所謂「廉恥」，「道義」，「天職」等等名詞，很自然的跑進了烏有之鄕。所謂中原文物之邦，上焉者「歌功頌德」，不得不作「能言鸚鵡毒於蛇」之能禽；下焉者「狗鑽蠅營」不得不效「送舊迎新」之娼妓！」</p>
<p>在這種現狀下，我們可以看出制度破產的原因與新文化不能產生的癥結了。</p>
<p>論到補救的問題，我們深感目前中國的病象，雖是萬分的危險，但决非不治之症，祗要全國同胞發覺危險的人一天多似一天，感受切膚之痛的人一天多似一天，準備不惜任何犧牲要外與帝國主義内與軍閥官僚拚命的人增加到相當程度的時候，民族解放的日子就快到了。我們對於讀者所提出的關於中國病根所在的種種問題，都表不接受與欣慰。我們與讀者同樣感到—必須認清楚了我們民族的根本危險所在，然後方能决定我們拚命的方向，採取比較有效的手段。此種抽象的答復，或者仍會引起一部分讀者的不滿，但是在這個年頭，能有機會公開的談話這些，還算是幸運呢！</p>

<p>— 廖銀香女士</p>
<p>賣花女</p>
<p>凡是到過蘇州遊玩的人，大槪對於我們都有一點薄薄的印象吧！每天夜裏三點鐘左右，我們結伴的跑到山上去。有一半作這職業的人是住在木凟附近的，但是要採鮮花却非上虎坵，天平，七子觀音幾個山陰裏去不可，這幾座山有不同的花，所以我們也按照花季去採，差不多一年三百六十天，没一時是無花可採的。從我們住所到最近的山，那遠一些的，有二十里左右，所以遲了一些去採，就常常要趕不上蘇州的早市了。</p>
<p>採完花以後，折回到蘇州閶門丨我們顧客的集中地—至早也在上午九點鐘左右了。一到閶門，就有許多花掮客等候着。這一些花有三分之二是被他們</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>買了去；若拿到城裏花攤上去，我們是賣不出什麽錢的。所剩下的一些就由我們自己拿到各旅館去呌賣。在前一二年，還常有不夠賣的時候，但是近年來，賣到下午兩三點鐘也總還剩下一小半，這並不是我們不肯貶價出售，根本是因爲買主太少了。至遲到四點鐘我們一定要回去。到了家裏吃一些東西，立刻就睡，不然，到第二天精神就夠不上了。午餐呢，我們平常只帶些乾糧出來在路上吃，生意好的時候，也有時在蘇州買點東西吃。所謂十七八個小時是爲衣食而工作，内中到有一大半時間是消耗在來回的路上的。</p>
<p>作這種買賣是苦也苦得可觀的，不但睡眠常常不足，就是每天長路的跋涉和風霜雨雪的侵襲也不是没有習慣和訓練的人所受得了的。結果，每天賺的錢，僅僅能維持我一個人的生活，也許還不夠，而且我們還得分一部份給旅館的茶房，不然的話，他們就要破壞我們的交易，甚至不准我們走進旅館的大門。</p>
<p>至於精神方面的痛苦，那更是不堪言狀。受欺凌和污辱是每天所不免的；從交易的開始，直到歸去，是無時不在苦悶中掙扎。那些青年的男花掮客，旅館的茶房，和輕薄的買主，時時向我們謔笑，甚至動手動脚的。但不論怎樣的難堪，我們也只好忍耐陪笑，不然，就會自己關死吃飯的路了。</p>
<p>誘姦或强姦賣花女的事實是不斷的發生着，於是，有許多和我一樣的人就不自覺的墮落了。當然，操這職業的人，多數是没福受敎育的，但是對於哲學上的一句「非完全則寗無」却是深切了解而能實行的。横豎名譽是已經破壞了，白璧之污是無可補救的了，那又何妨爽快的出賣了自己。出賣自己一次所得的物質代價，是超過了採花的苦工作一個月以上的所得，所以因被動而後纔自甘主動的。有些賣花女兼操淫業，不過這種人對於賣花只算副業了。她們每天早上向我們採花的人，批買一些去兜銷；她們不放棄賣花的原因，是賣花可以多認識一些客人，不但她們不願意再從事於採花的苦工作，就是在時間上也不容她們去半夜上山的。</p>
<p>我呢？僥天之大幸，父親是Ｘ戲院的案目，母親是賣花的前輩，現在在Ｘ旅館操洗衣一類的雜役，所以一些花掮客和茶房都和我們有舊，有的我還要呌他們一聲父執的尊稱呢！六年前我才十二歲，就跟母親一同賣花，所以常常被看作小孩子，對於我很少不堪的言語或動作的。有時一些顧客爲難我的時候，他們反來解圍。但是，就使這樣，我也已經是苦夠了！</p>
<p>我記得在六年前，賣花這生意還勉强的可以做得，但最近一年來，就以採花的人數而說，也只有十一二個人了，約減少了百分之七十，賣花的也少了一半。可是，花却總是供過於求，市面的蕭條可以想見了。於是爲了生意，賣花女們常常互相排擠，其中有許多人都到城裏去作住户的生意，而我們採花的人，現在也爲了生意清淡，就是跑旅館也無濟於事，所以只採花而常常不賣花了，賣花的人也更不是採花的人，這是以前所没有的大變化呢！可是，我們並不因此而失望而悲觀。且讓舊時代的花漸漸的枯去罷，但我們相信，新時代的花將從此含苞怒放；到那時，那鎖在我們身上的種種桎梏將一變而爲美麗的勝利的花圈，而我們也將成爲花中的「人」了！</p>

<p>— 提出者議員李六妹女士</p>
<p>我是ＸＸ紗廠的一個女工，每月可賺得工錢十來塊洋鈿，拿來養活我殘廢的老母親和我自己，已覺得很不夠：現在經理先生說本廠出品因爲日紗傾銷，銷場不暢，决定减工，照減工後的工鈿算來，我每月只可賺得八元大洋，家用更覺不夠了。我當時就同幾個姊妹商量以後生活的辦法。有一位姊妹說，從前年起就說大家抵制東洋貨，爲啥東洋紗現在還能在我國傾銷呢？這一定是經理先生對付我們工人的把戲。又一位姊妹說，從昨天起，東洋紗廠也減工了。我就問她，東洋紗旣已在我國傾銷，爲啥也要減工呢？那位姊姊說，東洋赤佬也說紗路銷行不暢啊！我剛想說而還没有說出口時，有一位姊姊就搶着說，中國紗廠減工，東洋紗廠也減工，這樣，中國紗廠可不是還要減工嗎？他們本國資本家和外國資本家爲了賺錢，你減工，我也減工，鬥來鬥去，他們倒嘸啥要緊，可是我們工人的生活怎樣呢？我，還有一個殘廢的五十四歲的老母親的我，又將怎樣生活呢？</p>

<p>在本刊前幾期的女職工專號中，很顯明的有兩個事實表現着；一個是婦女勞動者在各產業部門絶對的或相對的增加，另一個是男子勞動者在各產業部門絶對的或相對的減少，及其進一步婦女勞動者驅逐男子勞動者於一切產業部門之外而實行獨佔各勞動部門的事實。這是目前資本主義社會所特有的現象，毋庸我們去懷疑的。只要一考查產業革命在各國所演進的事實，便不難把握住這個問題的核心。</p>
<p>產業革命在資本主義的完成上，曾經致了最大的努力。牠是舊社會崩潰的喪鐘，同時又是新社會誕生的先聲。牠把人的勞動趨於簡單化，使如紡績和織造，所要的人力勞動，爲主要的僅限於繫接斷了的線。因爲此外的勞動，全部歸機器擔任了。因此，這個勞動，便不要費什麽力，只消用指頭加以機巧的動作便行了。像這樣被簡單化了的各產業部門，婦女勞動者就可以很自然的工作着，需用不到多麽的熟練和强健了。因此，那些技術純熟，體力壯健的男子勞動者，便縮小了他們原來需要的地域，很迅速的被排擠出各該勞動部門。而且，婦女勞動的工錢支付，也非常的低廉。這個使用廉價工錢支付的事實，對於以减低生產費而獲得剩餘價值的資本家階級更是有利的，這樣，婦女勞動者便横掃一切而獨佔各勞動部門了。</p>
<p>婦女獨佔勞動市場的結果，至少要發生以下的幾個反作用。第一便是男子勞動者大部分的乃至整個的被排擠出來，而流浪　在街頭，形成廣大的產業預備軍。第二便是勞動價值的减少，使勞動階級終歲勤勞的結果，而尚不足維持他們最低限度的生活，以致引起普遍的貧窮化。第三便是那些離開必須到社會出賣勞動的母親的兒童，因無人常常看護的關係，死亡率顯示着急劇的增加。這種現象，自產業革命發源地的英國，以至產業到晚近纔見發達的各殖民地國家，亦莫不很急激的扮演着。這是目前國際間最普遍的現象，也就是現階段世界體態所具有的特徵。</p>
<p>處在這種氛圍氣中的我國，爲未雨綢繆計，在消極方面應當使這種現象的重演於我國成爲不可能；在積極方面應把產生這種現象的社會制度着手改革。務使每個青年男女，都有共勞共享的機會，絶不容有男排女或女排男的偏頗現象顯現於勞動界。使人類一切物質文明，成爲大衆幸福的源泉，而不要成爲人類社會進化的桎梏。這便是人類控制自然界物質的眞諦。</p>
<p>英雄們起居注　某大班</p>
<h3 id="c276">破皮鞋　湘零女士 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>在高中畢了業無力升學的凌，在家裏足足悶坐了兩年，後來總算由友人的介紹得在某洋行當一個小寫字員了。</p>
<p>家居賦閒的滋味，和無業</p>
<p>的羞恥，凌在兩年中受夠了。現在他居然天天在路上爽快的跑進華屋巍峨的洋行，不像從前在平常日子跑路時那樣慌張的閃避熟人了；往日家裏米缸空了時那樣難過的心情現在也没有了。凌和一切初找到職業的青年一般地愉快，懷着許多的幻想。</p>
<p>大班是個高大的美國人，因爲一向遇着很舒服的生活之故，長得又肥又壯健了。有一天大班忽然呌凌給他拿一雙破底子的黑皮鞋到取費最廉的皮鞋店去修理。大班說：「貨色要好，時間要快。這雙皮鞋是眞正的美國貨，若把牠丢了是很可惜的。」</p>
<p>凌心裏老大不悅意，堂堂一個大班爲什麽不把皮鞋拿到外國鞋店，却偏要中國人拿到中國店裏修理呢？門檻眞精了！可是這鞋子是大班的！於是在他用盡腦力把他所知道的許多鞋店在心裏作了一番比較之後，終於拿到了家他認爲最可靠的鞋店裏去。講定了兩元價錢，他囑咐夥計說：</p>
<p>「這雙鞋子是我們行裏大班的的。貨色要好，後天來取！」</p>
<p>第三天到了，大班没有說起鞋子，也没有給他錢去取鞋。凌心裏已經很急了。那天下午他赴行時就順便到那鞋店去把鞋子取回行來。</p>
<p>大班早已到了行了，他正靠着舒服的椅子看報，口啣着粗大的雪茄烟。凌挾着鞋子，大踏步的走進富麗堂皇的大班室去，好像做了樁有功的事似的。大班一動也不動的只管看着報，凌戰戰兢兢的將鞋子放在大班面前。</p>
<p>「Ｏｈ，Ｇｏｏｄｌｌ」大班這樣呌了一聲，拿起鞋子翻看了。忽然面孔一紅，怒睜着眼，把鞋碎的一聲擲在地上：「這種狗皮子，我不要，快把牠拆下來！」</p>
<p>凌的心突突的跳動着，面色也灰白了，一般怒火衝上心來。他想把這個西人痛駡一頓，然後戴上帽子走回家！然而他没有那樣的勇氣，他終於灣下身，把鞋子拾起，重又往那家鞋店去了。因爲他的下意識告訴他：他的母親和弟弟是靠着他這份事兒吃飯的呵！他對鞋店夥計說：</p>
<p>「眞對不住！：：：我的大班是個猪玀！他說皮子不好，要把牠拆下來。請把價錢減收一點吧，是我自己拿出錢來的。自己倒霉！」</p>
<p>那個夥計倒還算客氣，允許减收一元。</p>
<p>凌好像脫了一塲災難似地挾着鞋子走回行裏。他憤恨地把鞋子放在大班的寫子檯上。大班一言不發，眼睛連看也不看凌一下。　　　　　　金　山　　　　賬單和發票堆滿在凌的檯上，他，</p>

<p>木然地呆視着打字機，無心工作了。</p>
<p>晚上回家吃飯時，母親見她一聲不響，便發問了：「凌，怎麽今晚上　　慨難看的，行裏大班駡了你嗎？」「不是，不是，」一口飯還没呑下，凌就忙應</p>

<p>亭子間</p>
<p>在公司裏勞頓了一整天，晚上，回到了自己的宿舍丨亭子間，這時是應該休息了。走向床沿坐下，躺了一會，便翻開我昨天剛買來的一本文藝創作，正看得出神，一陣嬉笑和說話的聲音忽然打入了我的耳鼓：</p>
<p>「三缺一！」好像前樓嫂嫂的語音。　　「打牌嗎？我來！」後樓阿姆接着說。</p>
<p>不一刻，便「匹匹！拍拍！」的開始了她們的工作。這使我難堪，書看了一會就去開了。我沉思一下，看看擺在窗沿上的閙鐘，短針正指着九點半。我想，還是早些兒睡吧，免得耳朶裏聽得怪討厭的。於是我打開被頭。</p>
<p>但事實却相反，「匹！拍！」的聲音聽得格外地分明。這可糟了！若把頭鑽在被窩裏，又未免不合衛生。但是打牌聲是一刻也不會停的。没有辦法，只得硬着頭皮鑽進了被窩。這算好了，可是悶得氣喘，怪難受的。最後好容易纔入了夢鄕。</p>
<p>「碰！吃！和！」好夢方酣，猛然給她們驚醒。原因是我的頭已不在被窩中了。扭亮電燈，揉了揉眼，對鐘上一看，已是十二點。這時我發狠了，這樣半夜三更，他媽的還打不倦，不管人家要睡嗎？「搬出去」的念頭又現在我的腦海，但是搬出去了能絶對聽不見打牌聲嗎？想到這裏，又是一陣小孩子的哭嚷。我長吁了一口氣，重復鑽入我的被窩。</p>
<p>「喳喳喳喳」，突然間一陣倒馬桶的聲音打破了我的甜夢。睜開我底迷眼，向窗外望去，人家的屋角上已射上了微薄的陽光。這時我耳朶裏打牌的聲音一變而爲「喳喳」的馬桶聲了。</p>
<p>披了衣服起身，正想開窗去吸取些新鮮空氣，可是，可惡的臭氣早已撲進來了。「喳喳」的聲音更形緊張。開不得只得關上。</p>
<p>呵！連吸取新鮮空氣的權利都没有出去泡洗臉水，非得將算子按没不可。盥洗完了，然後走出我的宿舍，重又踏進了爲生活掙扎的公司。</p>

<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>我是一個公司裏的小職員，每天七點鐘以前我就要到公司，一直到天黑了才得回家，有時還得做夜作。</p>
<p>經理先生是瞧不起我們的。他不准我們請假，請假一天就扣一天的錢。即使遲到半小時，也要被罰。早退也是如此。</p>
<p>有一天，我一早起來，照例不吃早飯就走。我住在離公司很遠的地方，是非乘公共汽車或電車不可的。</p>
<p>我站在汽車站上等候了好久，還不見車的影子，心裏急得發火。這時時針已指着六點半。好容易汽車來了，不料是一輛定備車。又過一會，來了一輛擠滿了乘客的汽車，連門都不開，任你呌破喉嚨也没用。一連過去三部，都是如此的。</p>
<p>時間已到了七點鐘，可是我仍站在汽車站上。想坐黄包車呢，則又非化四毛錢不行，可是我一天的收入最多也不過六毛錢而已。唉，我那時眞恨不得去尋死！</p>
<p>終於我在七點三刻到了公司。經理先生呌我去，我知道一頓臭駡是不能免的了。</p>
<p>「你爲什麽遲到？」他說：「我都來了，你還不來？」</p>
<p>「實在是等公共汽車等不着。」我低聲的答。</p>
<p>「哼，往常都不會等汽車，今天會等汽車！」</p>

<h3 id="c280">没落前的掙扎 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 若周</p>
<p>這是一個公例。一切的事物，當其新舊交替之際，舊的總是不肯安靜靜的死去，牠總是要掙扎，希望其生命意外的延長，越走死的地步，牠的掙扎也就厲害，到了後一刻，牠甚至會拿出最殘酷最無恥同時又最幼稚可笑的方法來和新的鬭爭，想從這最後一息的掙扎中，抓回牠即將死去的運命。可是事實終究不許牠這樣，一切的一切，時刻在前進，宇宙在不斷的運行，舊的必然要死去，新的終究要抬頭，無論牠如何拚命掙扎，結果還是徒勞，而且反因其過度的掙扎，會捉成牠加速度的崩潰。掙扎也罷，不掙扎也罷，歷史是永不逗留，也永不後退的。</p>
<p>記得民國十五年革命軍開始北伐之時，東南軍閥孫傳芳，他雖然對於革命嫉視，但因爲革命軍一時還没直接與他本身的利害相衝突，所以對於他治下潛伏着的革命勢力，雖然已有一種壓迫，但還不至於十分酷烈，江浙一帶的報紙，還可以見到關於國民黨活動的紀載；及後革命軍節節進展，不幾月已佔領江西，孫傳芳的統治顯見動搖，他的命運顯見日趨殁落，於是他就開始作猛烈的掙扎，對於革命勢力開始加以殘酷的壓迫。那時不要說新聞紙上再也看不到關於國民黨活動的紀載，只要在書箱裏搜出一本三民主義，就會立刻被槍决，甚至隨口談論時局也有殺頭的危險，滬寗路一帶，暗探密佈，青年無故被殺者不知其數，者名的劊子手李寳章，他的大刀隊在上海更是殺人如麻。那時簡直是歷史上所少見的黑暗時代，恐怖時代。在孫傳芳他們想，這種酷虐的暴力政策，一定可以把革命勢力鎭壓下去，一定可以將他們的統治重新穩固起來。然而事實怎樣呢？舊的還是殁落，新的終究起來！</p>
<p>據說現在時代又不同了，像抗日反帝一類的事固然不宜多談，就是只談點吃飯的私事，如生活怎樣苦啊：：：等等，據說也是危險非凡。明明我們是受着不可忍耐的壓迫，而那些壓迫者偏要說没有那會事；明明我們應該訴說，應該呌喊，而他們偏不准你訴說，偏不准你呌喊；自然，有許多人偏不聽他們的話，偏要訴說，偏要呌喊，那他們就會動手掩住你的嘴，就會：：：，至於無法訴說，無法呌喊而後止。</p>
<p>這樣，目前一時的勝利似乎是屬於他們的了，但是，且慢！歷史是怎樣告訴我們的？事實上他們並没有獲得了什麽勝利，他們所有的努力只是反證出革命的浪潮已經是衝到了最高點，而他們繁華的運命也將在這最後的掙扎中全盤的殁落。不信，看着罷！</p>

<h3 id="c281">薦頭店外史 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 噉生</p>
<p>第Ｘ回　窮途　倒痴子望在塌　噉飯舞地投奔薦頭店</p>
<p>話說噉飯生聽見隔壁那人自怨自艾道：「房錢，收房錢老爺後天又要上門了；米，還有兩天的粥好吃；柴錢，月底不好開口再欠下去。我眞不知道老子爺當初爲什麽給我讀這些斷命的書，難道預備到水門汀上去告地狀嗎？死了我一個，一家門老的小的怎麽辦？倒不如老天早些塌了下來，大家死了，倒也乾凈！老天爺，你到底塌不塌，要作弄我們到什麽地步？」</p>
<p>噉飯生聽到這裏，雖覺得這人瘋得可笑，但自己同那人正是同病朾憐，非但笑不出，而且勾起了自己一腔心事。他想，自己三年前也是最高尣府裏的寄生物，只因爲看着垂老的父親拿血汗腦汁去换來的錢化在這少爺們的班子裏，覺得非但没有價值，而且也於心不安，所以就忍心抛棄了預約方帽子的旅館生活，到了社會上來服務。雖然秉性愚魯，但愛皮西地阿依烏愛屋也會寫寫，三一三十一，四一二十二也會算算，所以在進去了三個月後的機關也有四十五隻大洋一月。誰又知道日本鬼子滅他的祖宗來了！爲了節衣縮食，預備長期抵抗，所以减省開支，機關合併，噉飯生捲起舖蓋，就此回老家吃家鄕米飯。然而福無雙至，禍不單行，今年已六十歲的老父任職了三十年的鋪子，也受了時局的影響，關門大吉。老父老母，連兩個弟妹，還有一個大的弟弟做徒去了的除外，都在自己的肩頭上。噉飯生想到這裏，不覺受了隔壁那個人的傳染，也希望「老天早些塌了下來。」</p>
<p>但過後，噉飯生明白天是不會塌的。然而要解决自己肩頭上的事，也險些拿腦子裏的汁都絞了出來，而想不出有效的辦法。託朋友嗎？但朋友自己也想託朋友。找親眷嗎？但親眷自己也要找親眷。這眞呌做「上天無路，入地無門。」忽然，噉飯生眼前一亮，給他想出了一線生機。</p>
<p>原來敢飯生想出了有一位去年六十歲聽說要做尋的老太太，在漢口路二十四號開了一所薦頭店，也是她老人家心腸軟，凡托她薦的人，她一槪不取費用。但是聽說薦頭店地方狹隘，開張之初，老太太的房間幾乎被那許多毛遂擠破了門，後來又聽說她慈悲心重，又拿她的後房闢了一些空地出來。但不知是否有一些間隙來容納後來的？</p>
<p>噉飯生也不再想下去了，他在破書堆中找出了半張白紙，提起毛錐，上面寫了一行「大减價」三字，下面又寫了「不顧血本，照碼對折，原價四十五元。」原來噉飯生知道這個年頭是百業減價的時候，所以他盜了這關子。寫畢就黏在長衫上，開了兩脚車，向薦頭店犯奔而來。及到店門一看果然名不虚傳，黑越越的擠滿了小小一間店堂。噉飯生提起脚跟一看，老闆娘年紀雖老，然不辭勞苦，蹺着上脚，忙得不亦樂乎。噉飯生擦了擦額上冷汗，一脚跨了進去，不知道老闆娘招待如何，且聽下回她自己分解。</p>

<h3 id="c282">澳大利亞電影界的新氣象（下） <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 深翁</p>
<p>影界鉅子覺悟到金錢的外溢</p>
<p>合力組織大公司以抗舶來品</p>
<p>雪尼聲現時正在攝製一部片子，片名呌Ｔｈｅ　Ｓｑｕａｔｔｅｒｓ　Ｄａｕｇｈｔｅｒ，是描寫牧塲上的實跡。這個大牧塲，是由一個人經營的。它的面積，和英格蘭差不多大小。一個英國的州郡，可以拿來放在這大草塲的角落裏。預備接着攝製的片子，是呌Ｔｈｅ　Ｓｉｔｅｎｃｅ　ｏｆ　Ｄｅａｎ　Ｍａｉｔｌａｎ，它的故事。是根據一部著名的說部，把一個英國的和平鄕村來做背景，那裏有的是激浪和漁景。而劇中的主人翁，就是那些鄙野和誠摯的村夫。於是一切的澳洲秘密，都將在銀幕上揭開了。</p>
<p>這兩部片子，都將由郝爾Ｋｅｎ　ＧＨａｌｌ導演，並由霍勒隊長Ｃａｐｔａｉｎ　Ｆｒａｎｋ　Ｈｕｒｌｅｙ從旁相助，他是那世界聞名的沙馬南極探險隊的攝影部主任，他曾和沙克雷頓賭過東道，要在多冰的水底裏，去找尋被冰山衝掉的影片。結果是沙克雷頓輸了，他又曾坐着飛機，飛到新基尼的雲中，去攝去影片。</p>
<p>在最近的將來，那些奇怪的影片，都要在澳大利亞和它的南鄰產生出來了。不久以前，那領導騎兵隊去征服巴力士坦的哈利爵士，有一個姪子，到南太平洋的巴特揆綸島去拍片子。船離海岸還有二百里，就在波浪滔天的大洋中和土人大戰起來，結果還給土人把他們從輪船上捉去。他們因此在島上頭留了好幾個星期，那裏盡是住着違法的暴徒和塔希提婦女，結果攝片的目的,雖已達到，在一個黑暗的夜裏，從一艘路過的船上，逃出虎口；但是他們的性命，險些送掉。</p>
<p>在這時的英國銀幕上，也許能看見蒙克門攝製的（大堡礁）短片。這種礁石，伸展在苦因十闌海岸外，差不多有一千哩長短，兩面還平行着吃人的鯊魚。你要是穿着威林登長靴，踏到那珊瑚島上去，會發現着許許多多的奇怪東西，一條海蛇撲過來了，你自然要向别處跳，但是也許這一跳，會踏到石魚身上去。天呀！你再也分别不出牠是一個動物，還是一塊石頭，可是牠的鋒利的剌兒，已經向着你的足部剌進來了。如果你是打從剌參漁船上來的土人，你就准死，但是你是白人，還不要緊，因爲你是穿着靴子的呀！</p>
<p>除此之外，還有許多珍奇的事物，都能够給將來的澳洲電影做材料。現在所感困難的，倒還是人材問題。現在所需要的角色，是要年輕而帶有浪漫性的。塞林君已經發現着兩個，一位是萊菲希，還有一位呌西席爾斯考特。此外雖然還有許多電影人材，但是他們都去到厄爾斯特里或好萊塢，去試騐他們的命運了。</p>
<p>在將來的十二個月中，也許可以看見較多的本地演員，得一發展的機會；不過暫時終去缺乏人材，雪尼聲公司將進行攝製的Ｔｈｅ　Ｓｉｌｅｎｃｅ　ｏｆ　Ｄｅａｎ　Ｍａｉｔｌａｎｄ一片，還預備到英國是找一位明星，來澳擔任主角。所以他們不但對於影片公司，應有極大的組織；而對於電影人材，也還得想法去培植。這就是澳大利亞電影事業的最近狀况，比較以前，總算是已經有了相當的進步了。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c283">評（熱的青春）Ｈｏｔ　Ｐｅｐｐｅｒ <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>劇情熱鬧　含義膚淺</p>
<p>導演表演　均有可觀</p>
<p>大槪常常和美國電影接近的人，都會知道美國電影在目前决不能脫離「肉感」或「香艷」的圈套，於是這種充溢着黄金色彩的畫面，對於物質文明的佔有者，確成爲一種醉人的娱樂利器。假如我們還希望着在這種實質之外，再獲得某種頗有重大價值的作品，當然這不免是使我們失望的了。</p>
<p>果然，美國影業者仍極力的在這個狹窄的範圍中兜圈子，可是爲了每個電影片不便完全雷同，於是導演或編劇者祗好在片子的情節上變換一下，而其整個的内容，當然是和其他作品一致的。關於這一點，我們在「熱的青春」中正可看得出來。</p>
<p>那末，在熱的青春中有些什麽呢？有熱的女郎，有暴的紳士，有縱情的歌舞，有裸體的顫抖，有宏量的飮酒，有揮金如土的賭博。詐欺恐嚇以取財，販賣私貨以致富，這一切的一切，都是上層階級的實情，但也是他們罪惡的暴露。當然，這樣的内容，我們不能說它毫無意義，但是很明顯的僅僅是暴露而已。</p>
<p>在本片中，有着熱鬧的劇情，自首至尾，都一點也不沉悶。在這裏，我們很顯然的可以知道導演Ｊｏｈｎ　Ｂｌｙｓｔｏｎｅ努力所致。但是我們看過本片之後，却不能受着絲毫剌戟，於是它也就不能給與我們何等深刻的印象。當然，這因爲是侷限於喜劇的形式，不過内容假如更</p>
<p>能充實起來，仍是可以影響觀衆的吧？</p>
<p>幾個已經成名的主要演員，固然仍無遜於過去的成績。然而如麥克勞倫（Ｖｉｃｔｏｒ　Ｍｃｌａｇｌｅｎ）動作的單調，究竟不能得看觀衆十足的好感。飾熱女郎Ｐｅｐｐｅｒ的女角Ｌｕｐｅ　Ｖｅｌｅｚ的表演，確是非常生動的，她那野性暴露，雖然是未免誇大，但是她却充分的發揮了劇中人的個性，而使本片有了特殊的色彩。</p>
<p>總之，在本片中我們可看出資本主義的電影的特徵，而且這是在崩潰的過程中所應有的現象。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c284">金亨利導演「賽珍會」的特色 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 桀克</p>
<p>金亨利導演的「賽珍會」的確是一部十分生動饒有興趣的影片：一幕一幕接着把劇情展開，一幕一幕表映出細巧靈活的生動興趣。劇中人物如珍妮蓋諾飾美麗的農家女，惠爾羅吉士飾謹愿的富農，莎麗嬡鸞飾多情的女戲子，劉亞里士飾少年新聞記者，羅意絲特蘭潄飾富農主婦，瑙門福士德飾不甘休的農家子丨丨個個演來成爲很適當的配角。</p>
<p>本片的結構以一家世外桃源似的美國農村生活爲序幕；以一年一度的州集，就是現在譯作賽珍會的，爲骨幹在這賽珍會裏一州各都市各農村的人們都來參加，因此就自然的有機會生出許許多多有趣的事情。最後這張片子便歸到原來的一家農村爲尾聲，不過本片結束的一幕，一定要把那美麗的農家女與少年新聞記者在賽珍會裏發生的一段浪漫史得着一個美滿的結局似乎有點畫蛇添足了。</p>
<p>金亨利導演最成功的地方就是生動，靈活的生動，及是興趣，異樣的興趣。本片可說是幕幕生動幕幕有趣，而其生動的趣又都是出之於旁敲側擊十分自然。最特色的譬如在賽珍會裏評判員評判的時候，各人屏息着期待評判結果，應當是死沉沉般的不生動了，然而各人不息地一齊搖着一把扇子，而各人的扇子又各式各樣不同，這樣一來，一面旣把賽珍會集會的時候秋天的炎熱描寫出來，一面又把這一幕生動起來了。再如農家女與新聞記者初戀的時候以致後來情話綿綿的時候都以飛車襯托着，這樣便把靜悄悄的戀愛經過生動了，而又使賽珍會的色彩圖畫出來。其餘更如農家子與女戲子幽會惜别的一夜，隱約地祗見一床，清晰地聽聞農家子與女戲子情話的聲音，好幾分鐘之久，其時没有人的動作，然而却有光綫的時時轉換和微風吹動紗窗的悠悠飄　，這裏就生動了，最後如新聞記者與農家女别後重逢的時候却下着一天大雨，兩人便在簌簌雨絲中互相儇抱着親吻，更以沿路賽珍會的大告白板爲背影，雨點濕透這告白紙，接着便是告白板上賽珍會幾個大字，破碎地脫落下來，而這「賽珍會」影戲也就閉幕了。這是多麽生動！多麽靈活的手腕！</p>
<p>本片的笑料，有的地方借着舉動，有的地方借着言語，也是不少。白猪一頭因戀愛而感着生氣，因不見紅母猪而萎頓；富農一心一意死守着猪仔；以及評判猪仔時候，音樂隊高奏着，三個奇形怪狀的評判員鄭重其事的介紹着；—這是笑料中帶着的諷剌。賽珍會七天之期旣滿，各自收拾箱範拆下篷帳，汽車緩緩開動，一幅盛會已散的悽涼景象歷歷在目——這是熱閙之後的悲哀。</p>

<p>— 悠悠</p>
<p>在國產電影界裏，艾霞的歷史並不長久。現在她的地位，雖還屈居人下，但在中國這樣多數不能動筆的明星隊裏，她居然能夠自擬劇本，也頗足引以自豪的了。</p>
<p>「現代一女性」的劇本，是描寫一位摩登小姐，思想非常灑脫，非常澈底；但是却逃不過戀愛關頭，愛上了一個使君有婦的新聞記者。她對他說：「我知道你結過婚，你很愛你的妻子；但是我不管，祇問你愛不愛我就好了。」這樣，她就用全心全力去愛她。後來他失了業，她因爲要帮助他，就偷了常常追求着她的一個大腹賈的支票，因而郎當入獄。這是她的苦心，誰知那新聞記者對她的行爲竟不諒解。那時恰巧她有一個女友同在獄中，她受了女友的勸導，才覺悟過來，出獄時變成一個嶄新的革命女性了。—　—這片子的導演者是李萍倩君，主角就是艾霞自己。</p>
<p>「現代一女子」編成以後，大家都說艾霞的自叙傳，因爲她常常主張戀愛要澈底的。究竟是不是「夫人自道」我們雖不敢决定；但「言爲心聲」，裏面多少總有點她的思想吧？</p>

<p>Enemy Artillery Levels Two Left Flank Heights</p>
<p>Our Troops Establish Defenses Step by Step; New Positions Are Extremely Solid</p>
<p>No Contact at the Front Yesterday; Only Intermittent Artillery Fire</p>
<p>Xiao's Unit at Xinglong, Under the Command of Xiao Zhichu, Shoots Down a Japanese Plane</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the vicinity of Gubeikou, the entire Japanese 8th Division has been launching fierce attacks on our Nanti’anmen positions for the past ten days. Simultaneously, over ten enemy planes, coordinating with sixty to seventy artillery pieces, concentrated their bombardment on our left flank, specifically the 4213 and 425 heights. This caused all fortifications there to be destroyed by the enemy's intense artillery fire and concentrated aerial bombing. The defending soldiers, numbering several hundred, had no cover apart from those killed in action. Fortunately, our army had constructed reserve fortifications directly behind these areas, which were completed yesterday. Consequently, the two heights were abandoned, and from this morning onwards, we are engaging the enemy from the new lines of defense, which offer solid cover. Our new lines are exceptionally strong, and we have established defenses step-by-step between Nanti’anmen and Shixia. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Our Left and Right Flank Positions Destroyed <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telephone report from Miyun, the Suzuki Brigade of the Japanese 8th Division, at dawn on the 28th, divided into five columns, wading across the Chao River. Upon reaching the south bank, they advanced under artillery cover. Over seventy heavy artillery pieces fired like dense raindrops. Our left and right flank positions at Nanti’anmen were bombarded by the enemy, suffering almost complete destruction. Reinforcements were unable to advance.

<p>The Dalai's Army Uses a Policy of Distant Diplomacy and Close Offenses:</p>
<p>On One Hand, Appeasing the Qing Army, On the Other Hand, Attempting to Pressure Kang</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei Summons Liu Wenhui's Representative to Inquire About Everything</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The origin of the rumor that Tibetan troops crossed the river to invade is that the garrison in Western Kang is extremely small, and the infighting within the Sichuan army makes Kang's defenses particularly vulnerable. The Dalai also has the ambition to realize the unification of Kangzang, so taking advantage of the tense situation in the Northeast and the incident in the new province, he increased the number of Tibetan troops stationed in Qamdo by over 2,000, equipping them with military equipment. Tibetan troops guarding across the Jinsha River also frequently provoked the Kang army. Seeing this situation, the Deng Pan Village Brigade stationed in the Kang territory, in addition to telegraphing Sichuan-Tibet Border Defense Commander Liu Wenhui for rapid reinforcement, also made contact with the Qing army under Ma Bufang, creating a situation where the Qing army would defend Yushu and Qingke in order to restrain the Tibetan army. The Qing army also increased its defenses in the front line by over 3,000. The Deng Brigade also transferred 1,000 troops to the front line. Whether the Kang and Tibetan armies have officially made contact has not yet been confirmed, but they have indeed formed opposing camps. This is the Dalai's use of a policy of distant diplomacy and close offenses. On one hand, he is feigning friendship with the Qing army under Ma Bufang, and is also doing his best to make peace with the Qing army, negotiating a peace treaty, and agreeing that the Qing and Tibetan armies will not invade each other, attempting to ease the Qing army's plan to attack the Tibetan army. On the other hand, he is fully preparing his military, taking the opportunity to cross the Jinsha River and launch a large-scale invasion of Kang, avoiding the worry of attacks from the Qing army on his flanks. It is reported that the Qing army clearly knows of the Tibetan army's sinister plot, but in order to comply with the central government's intention to resolve the matter peacefully, it still intends to negotiate a treaty with the Dalai to avoid escalating the situation. The government is trying to quell the incident in Xinjiang. If the Tibetan army's invasion of Kang is not quickly stopped at this time, it is feared that it will not only affect the Xinjiang affair, but the Kangzang dispute will be even more difficult to resolve in the future. It is reported that the various relevant agencies of the central government have given this matter deep consideration. In addition to finding ways to eliminate the Xinjiang incident to prevent a certain country from taking the opportunity to incite trouble, on one hand, they still adhere to the established advocacy of peace, urging the Kang army to defend, and also telegraphing the Dalai, adhering to the original intention of obeying the central government and maintaining peace, and not being used by outsiders. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei, because the Dalai's army is advancing into Western Kang and the situation is reportedly becoming serious, and also because of the dispute between Liu and Deng over land, specially summoned Leng Rong, the representative of Liu Wenhui, at the Executive Yuan at 11:00 AM on the 28th, to inquire about the Dalai's advancement into Western Kang and recent developments in Sichuan, in order to prepare for a response.

<h3 id="e26">The Japanese Army's Withdrawal from Luandong and Our Country's Countermeasures (Part 2) – Ming <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The Conversion of Policy Towards Japan</p>
<p>The Japanese militarists, aware of the internal and external situations, deeply understand that prolonging the war is not a good strategy. Therefore, they have changed their tactics, concealing their military weaknesses, and simultaneously not using their weaknesses to attack our country's strengths. Our army indeed lacks modern equipment, and three-dimensional warfare is not something we are accustomed to. The only option is a final decisive battle. The infantry's weapons, in well-trained units, can exert their sniping effectiveness and demonstrate their characteristics of fighting independently. If the Japanese army recklessly advances, without our preparation for a total mobilization along the entire line, it will indeed be difficult to secure victory. However, it is also certain that Japan will not be able to peacefully occupy the entire territory of Rehe as it did before. Therefore, the Japanese army wants to obtain the greatest reward with the smallest sacrifice. The only option is to withdraw the Japanese troops from Luandong and concentrate their forces on another point to attack our side. Furthermore, while the Japanese troops in Luandong are pretending to retreat, they are attacking Nanti’anmen quite urgently. One reason is to observe whether our country's military internal affairs are well-organized. Another reason is to falsely prove that their empty talk of defending the Great Wall is not a lie, in order to deceive international public opinion and fool their own people. Therefore, they can use a smaller force to restrain our huge forces along the Luan River up to Gubeikou, and be able to draw elite troops to attack Zhangduo.</p>
<p>The situation within Chahar is not as dangerous as Rehe, and it lacks elite troops capable of fighting. Sun Dianying's unit has traveled thousands of miles, but occupying and holding territory is not its strength. The Shanxi army under Fu Zuoyi has shown merit in internal affairs, but they are also small-scale battles. They not only lack a correct and clear understanding of international warfare, but they also probably lack a thorough and concrete understanding of the Japanese imperialists who are the enemies in front of them. Using them to fight against Japan, how can we expect them to win?</p>
<p>Indeed, in the current situation, our country is forced into an inferior position, which is undeniable and should not be denied. However, our people are the most hardworking and diligent in the world, and our reserves of coal, iron, and oil are second only to North America. Using this to fight against Japan, there is no reason why we cannot save ourselves. Moreover, the final victory or defeat of modern warfare does not lie in the current military equipment, but in the economic strength of the country. Since the outbreak of the global economic panic, Japan's national strength has been declining day by day. More than half of the rural population is almost entirely trapped in the tragic state of living in difficulty. However, its warlords are using foreign military operations to cover up their ugliness. If our country can truly fight to the death with them, then the right to settle the final victory or defeat will ultimately be in our hands. Therefore, although our military strength is weak, if we can strive to hold on, there will definitely be a day to turn defeat into victory. However, where does the path to victory lie? Where does the path to our self-salvation lie?</p>
<p>First, we must launch a nationwide national struggle. Our country has been weak for a long time, and our ingrained habits are too deep. Without intense stimulation, it will be difficult to overcome the inertia passed down from history. Recently, the three northeastern provinces have been forcibly seized, and the Rehe area has been further ravaged. The five counties of Luandong are almost entirely under the threat of enemy forces. Enemy cavalry have been seen in many important passes along the Great Wall. These events not only affect politics, but also directly threaten the daily lives of individuals. Young people with warm blood have long been filled with resentment and eagerness to vent it. Even those who are gentle and prudent are thinking about how to serve the country and be loyal to the nation. For the current plan, it is appropriate to mobilize the entire Chinese nation and launch this extraordinary situation. Regardless of temporary success or failure, we must determine the fundamental strategy for fighting against Japan, and then the precarious situation can be opened up.</p>
<p>Second, we must actively cultivate the rural economy and control the urban economy. The main reason for our country's weakness is that politics is not on the right track, but is merely a contradiction in the upper-level structure. In fact, the fundamental ingrained problem lies in the decline of the agricultural economy. Commercial capital has no possibility of transforming into a purely capitalist economic organization, and a new path has not yet been opened up. Therefore, it is subject to extreme pressure from the commodities and financial capital of various countries, and internally it is oppressed by the unreasonable ravages of warlords. The axis of conversion from now on is cultivating rural production, which is essential. Revolving rural finance is also necessary. Moreover, illegal suppression and unreasonable exploitation, as well as general exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, must be immediately exempted. Corvée labor and requisitions should be strictly prohibited. Otherwise, the destruction of the countryside will become even more unbearable, and the crisis of the nation's future will be further intensified. Most of the general urban (economy) is engaged in commercial transshipment, with fewer centered on industry. However, there are also some regions that have the rudiments of modern industry. At this time of unfolding an extraordinary situation, the first thing to do is to have a detailed and thorough investigation. The second thing to do is to make the various industrial organizations prepared for extraordinary times. The third thing to do is to prepare for wartime control. Only then can we concentrate our national strength to fight a long-term battle with the enemy.</p>
<p>Third, politics in extraordinary times must be based on the masses. Our country has a vast territory, and transportation is inconvenient. It is indeed not easy to get the masses of the whole country to participate in politics. However, we must not give up eating because of choking, ignoring the power of the masses. For example, the Japanese warlords, although acting willfully, must always borrow the masses as a premise, using (the veterans' association) as the backbone to inspire their citizens and incite their aggressive ambitions. Otherwise, they will still not be able to avoid failure. Moreover, since the Northern Expedition unified our country, political thought has become increasingly developed. With a great enemy at hand, if there is no mass base in politics, there will be no way out internally, and what can be done externally? Therefore, the opening up of political power is naturally a matter of course. In particular, it is necessary to safeguard the interests of the hardworking masses in order to achieve the effect of cooperation between the upper and lower levels and to live up to the reality of national unity.</p>
<p>The above three points are indeed abstract principles, but they are the minimum requirements for the people of our country today, and they are also the necessary conditions for fighting against Japan. We offer our foolish sincerity, hoping that the masses of our whole country will work together to break through the current difficulties and straighten the front line against Japan.</p>

Both sides hope that after Herriot reports to his government, talks will continue between Washington and Paris. A concrete compromise is expected to be reached at the World Economic Conference in June. In addition to war debts, the U.S. President and the French representative also studied the development of commercial policies to promote international trade, as well as unifying national banking policies, methods for governments to undertake public works to prevent business stagnation, and proposals to improve the silver standard. After the statement was released, Herriot departed for New York to board a ship back to France. (Reuter, 28th)</p>

<p>(Washington) This morning, French representative and former Premier Herriot paid his final visit to President Roosevelt. Herriot presented the U.S. President with a commemorative album of the Allied nations during the European War, which included photocopies of signatures of key military and political figures from various countries during the war. Roosevelt, in return, inscribed a personal photograph and presented it to Herriot to express his gratitude. As Herriot left the White House, he declared to reporters, "The United States is known to the world for its Declaration of Independence, and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man also shines in history. It is truly necessary for both nations to join hands." Herriot shook hands with Roosevelt and his wife at 11:15 a.m., both radiating vitality. They exchanged wishes for each other's well-being. As Herriot entered his car, a crowd in the White House garden surrounded him, cheering loudly, creating a feeling of fond farewell. (Havas, 28th)</p>

<p>(New York) French representative and former Premier Herriot, French Ambassador to the United States de Laboulaye, and their delegation arrived here at 5:00 p.m. by special train. Herriot then made a statement to reporters, saying that he had discussed an economic truce between France and the United States with President Roosevelt. However, the duration and implementation of the truce still need further study. He hopes the economic truce can be extended at least until the London Economic Conference is convened. Subsequently, he discussed tariffs, disarmament, and security issues. Herriot said that Roosevelt's intention to improve the Briand-Kellogg Pact was admirable. The treaty does indeed require improvement and greater clarity. Herriot concluded by saying that he was very optimistic about leaving the United States and that the talks went very well.

<h3 id="e32">Thorough Study of Silver Price Issue <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(New York) The New York Times's Washington dispatch today stated that the silver price stipulated in the Pittman plan differs by 30% from the current silver price. Debtor nations could benefit from this, but to what extent other countries besides Britain will take advantage of this opportunity is highly speculative. Silver proponents believe that debtor nations using silver to repay debts can absorb the surplus silver in the market, gradually raising the price of silver. If Britain does not use the silver it has stockpiled in India to repay war debts, the price of silver will rise to a level detrimental to the United States. However, if Britain uses Indian silver, it can help sell it off with minimal losses, and both Britain and India will benefit if it is shipped and sold at a special price. The Indian treasury holds approximately 400 to 500 million ounces of silver, which is the main reason for the recent decline in silver prices. Congressional silver proponents expect the Pittman plan to raise the world silver price to 50 or 60 cents. It is said that India is now preparing to pay off its debt to Britain with 75 million yuan in silver. If so, Britain and India can use this to offset the war debt owed to the United States in June, with a surplus remaining. In addition to allowing debtor nations to use silver to repay debts, the United States also advocates using silver as part of the reserve for national banks and minting more silver coins. Experts from the United States, Britain, and France have thoroughly studied this proposal in London, and the suggestion to use silver to pay for various small-denomination currencies, with a maximum silver equivalent of 5 U.S. dollars, 1 British pound, or 50 or 100 French francs, is said to have been successfully resolved. However, in reality, experts from Britain and France do not seem entirely enthusiastic about the entire American plan. According to congressional leaders, Britain and France are doing this to postpone further consideration of war debts until after the World Economic Conference. (Reuter, 28th)</p>

<p>Rural Relief Bill Passed Simultaneously</p>
<p>Authorizing the President to Reduce the Gold Content of the Dollar</p>
<p>Issuance of New Securities and Free Minting of Silver Coins</p>
<p>Limit of 200 Million Yuan for Using Silver to Repay Debts</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Senate today passed the inflation bill and the rural relief bill by an overwhelming majority, rejecting the Republican proposal to pay veterans' bonuses in cash. The two bills have now been sent to the House of Representatives, and Speaker Rayburn has guaranteed that they will pass. If the House does not amend the contents of the two bills, the U.S. President will have unlimited discretionary power over monetary policy. This inflation bill was drafted by government-appointed Senator Thomas Elmer, according to the President's intentions, and supported by John Thomas, as a supplement to the rural relief bill, to avoid the inflation faction enacting untimely legislation. Its main provisions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Authorizing the President to issue new Treasury bonds totaling 60 billion yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Debtor nations of war debts may repay war debts with 200 million yuan in silver within the next six months.</p>
<p>(3) The President may reset the value of the U.S. dollar, reducing its gold content by up to 50%.</p>
<p>After the Senate convened today, it proceeded with this bill. First, Johnson's motion was passed by a vote of 53 to 32, allowing debtor nations to pay with silver. The difference between the yes and no votes in today's votes was the smallest, indicating the number of people in Congress who oppose making concessions to debtor nations. Next, Senator Robinson's proposal to pay veterans' bonuses in cash, which was also considered a supplement to the rural relief bill, was rejected by a vote of 61 to 29. Then, the entire inflation bill was passed by a vote of 64 to 21. Shortly thereafter, the Senate also passed the rural relief bill by a vote of 64 to 20. At the same time, the House also passed the Home Owners' Loan Act, which allows the government to set up an agency to accept mortgages from small homeowners, protecting them from being forced into foreclosure.

<h3 id="e35">Contents of the Rural Relief Bill <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Government Will Use Extraordinary Measures</p>
<p>To Raise the Market Price of Basic Agricultural Products</p>
<p>(Washington) Since the U.S. Senate passed the rural relief bill by a vote of 64 to 20 today, the United States will begin using extraordinary measures to attempt to reduce the surplus of cotton and raise its market price. Although the bill authorizes the Department of Agriculture to find ways to reduce the acreage planted and raise the market price of all basic agricultural products, cotton will be the first to be rescued, followed by wheat, and then cattle, pigs, rice, sugar, dairy products, and tobacco. The most significant observation is that this bill will make the U.S. government a cotton merchant and tenant of raw fields. The initiators of this bill claimed today that if the opinions stipulated in the bill are implemented, the world price of cotton will have hope of rising. The main points of the bill are as follows: (1) If farmers reduce their acreage by more than 30%, the government will provide subsidies. (2) Cotton planters can reduce their plantable acreage and purchase cheap trading privileges from the Department of Agriculture (i.e., special rights to compel the other party to perform the contract of buying and selling at a fixed price at any time within a specified period), the quantity of which is equal to the amount reduced in comparison with the previous year's harvest. (3) The government will lease the boundary land of farmers' fields to create forests or other uses that do not compete with farmers. (4) The government may accept rural mortgages through land banks and special financial institutions and provide long-term, low-interest loans. (5) The Department of Agriculture may stipulate the minimum price at which agricultural products are sold in the domestic market and guarantee the maintenance of this price. (6) The government may levy taxes on the buying and selling of basic agricultural products, using the tax revenue to fund acreage reduction subsidies and land rental fees, but exports are exempt from taxation. (7) Those engaged in agricultural product trading must obtain a license from the federal government, with a fee of 1,000 yuan, and those who delay obtaining a license will be fined. (8) When the basic agricultural products listed in this bill are imported from abroad, the import tax will be increased, and the increased tax rate will be equal to the tax levied on domestic trading of the same products. (9) After levying taxes on the buying and selling of agricultural products, in order to prevent agricultural product merchants from experiencing unexpected difficulties, they are allowed to borrow funds from the Finance Rehabilitation Corporation for assistance during the initial implementation period. (10) The basic agricultural products listed in this bill include cotton, wheat, cattle, pigs, rice, tobacco, sugar, and dairy products. Sugar was not initially included but was added at the last minute today. However, Philippine sugar was not included in the scope of this bill's relief. Therefore, it is stipulated that sugar imported from the Philippines after this will be subject to a compensatory tax (i.e., the increased import tax) according to the example of foreign products. However, the annual tax revenue, which is about 10 million yuan, will be allocated to the Philippine government. (11) Authorizing the President to suspend the implementation of this bill after the agricultural emergency is deemed to have been safely overcome. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Lieutenant General Koiso, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, has been in Tokyo since the 11th, consulting with financial groups and the government on concrete measures to plunder our four eastern provinces. After all matters were settled, he is scheduled to depart from Tokyo Station at 9:43 tonight to rush back to Changchun. Koiso visited Army Minister Araki at 4:30 this afternoon for a lengthy final discussion. Afterwards, he told the Japanese press corps that what "Manchukuo" currently needs is to develop its industries and maintain public order. Developing industries requires a large amount of capital, and the military and the拓務省 will be fully responsible for preparing for this. The Kwantung Army will do its best to maintain public order. During the sorghum-growing season, the remaining anti-Japanese armies lurking in various places will seize the opportunity to rise again. The Kwantung Army has already formulated countermeasures for this and will deal with them in a timely manner according to procedures. Reforming the police system of the Kwantung Government is not a major issue from a global perspective. It is indeed necessary to reform it at present because all of the police in Manchuria are already under the control of the Japanese military police headquarters. The Kwantung Government should not jump out of the circle. We are willing to resolve the issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway through peaceful means, but the future remains chaotic. Although foreign reports are spreading rumors that Japanese troops have been dispatched to the Chinese Eastern Railway, this is not the case. The issue with China requires waiting for its exhaustion before seeking peace. Otherwise, we can wait for the right time to come. (Hualian Telegram, 29th)</p>

<p>Huang Musong Flies to Jiangxi to Meet Chiang Kai-shek and Request Instructions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Musong, Deputy Chief of Staff of the General Staff Headquarters, has been appointed by the National Government as the high commissioner to pacify Xinjiang. Huang is flying to Jiangxi to meet Chiang Kai-shek to report on his previous inspection of the military situation in North China and to request instructions on pacifying Xinjiang and handling the aftermath. It is said that the government is paying close attention to the Xinjiang incident and has carefully discussed it with the Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, and the General Staff Headquarters. A concrete plan has been formulated. After Huang returns to Nanjing from Jiangxi, he will set off to the west to implement the plan. In addition, in order to thoroughly reorganize the administration of Xinjiang Province, the government will order representatives from the military, finance, industry, and transportation departments to accompany Huang to investigate the truth and assist in everything. (Special Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government dispatched Huang Musong to Xinjiang on the 28th to pacify the region. Huang flew to Jiangxi on the morning of the 29th to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and request instructions. Huang said to people before his departure that he had little research on the political situation in Xinjiang Province. He hopes that all sectors will provide guidance on his mission to Xinjiang. He will stay in Jiangxi for about two or three days and then transfer to Shanghai to take a ship to Vladivostok and then to Siberia to Xinjiang. The Central Government has decided to send more experts in politics, education, and economics to Xinjiang to conduct a thorough investigation as a lesson for thoroughly resolving the dispute. Immediately, Zhang Fengjiu and Wang Ruyi, representatives of Xinjiang Province stationed in Nanjing, visited Huang and urged him to leave. According to Zhang, he originally planned to go to Jiangxi this morning to request instructions, and only when he boarded the ship did he learn that Huang had been appointed to pacify Xinjiang. Therefore, he returned to visit Huang to urge him to leave, saying that the incident in Xinjiang Province is of great importance to the whole country, and after the Central Government sends personnel to Xinjiang, the incident will never escalate. (Central News Agency Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Ruyi, Director of the Nanjing Office of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, told reporters on the 29th that after the incident in Xinjiang Province, Chairman Jin may have mishandled it, but there is absolutely no oppression of the Hui people. The distant cause was actually that Ma Zhongying attempted to create chaos to build a special force for the Hui people. After the incident, Ma's troops advanced from Suzhou to Xinjiang Province, and there were often appeals in the name of the Xinjiang Native Place Association for the 1.2 million Hui people. In fact, the total number of Han and Hui people in Xinjiang Province is only 2.45 million. As for the latest situation, he does not know the details due to the obstruction of communications. If Huang Musong can quickly enter Xinjiang, the incident can be resolved immediately. (Central News Agency Telegram, 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e42">Ma Yinchu Observes the U.S. Abandonment of the Gold Standard <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu's observations on the U.S. abandonment of the gold standard are as follows: The United States is the world's major gold-using country. The gold stored in the country accounts for more than 40% of the world's total. The unprecedented financial turmoil in the world recently occurred in this golden country. Although Roosevelt's handling was appropriate, the internal crisis was not fundamentally eliminated, and future changes are also unpredictable because the embers have not been extinguished, and there is a fear that the ashes will reignite.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's declaration banning gold exports is a temporary emergency measure, but knowledgeable people predict that Roosevelt will ultimately adopt a policy of abandoning the gold standard as a tool to adjust the U.S. economy. Without this, all relief bills will be difficult to achieve practical results. I believe that the reasons for the U.S. abandonment of the gold standard are, first, to raise prices to solve its domestic economic problems. The United States has overproduction, and due to the high tariffs of various countries and the changing standard, it is unable to sell its inventory. As a result, prices have fallen, rural areas have declined, factories have closed, society is unstable, and national tax revenue has decreased. Budget imbalances and other problems have followed one another. Therefore, the current solution must start with raising prices. After abandoning the gold standard, the policy of inflation can be used to raise prices, and the means of falling gold prices can be used to stimulate exports. Domestic industrial unemployment and financial issues can be solved accordingly. The Far East market has always been dominated by Britain, Japan, and the United States, but because Britain and Japan abandoned the gold standard one after another, the U.S. Far East market was severely hit. On the one hand, Japan used the means of falling yen prices to continue to develop the Far East market. On the other hand, it used trade income as military expenses for invading China, which was all detrimental to the United States. The United States had to use economic methods to suppress Japan's activities. Because after the devaluation of the U.S. dollar, U.S. goods could re-enter the Far East market. Once Japanese goods were unsalable, its domestic economic organization would undergo major changes. This kind of economic competition is enough to restrain the development of the Japanese. The purpose of Roosevelt's invitation to the British Prime Minister for talks was to seek the understanding of Britain and take joint action to deal with the ambitions of this East Asian aggressor. In addition, there is another reason, which is the policy of the Democratic Party. We know that the Democratic Party was originally based on the silver mine owners and agriculturalists in the southwestern provinces. The majority of the party hopes that the price of silver will rise and the price of raw materials will rise. Abandoning the gold standard is a shortcut to raising the price of silver and goods. At least part of Roosevelt's intention in doing this is to satisfy the wishes of his voters and consolidate his future political position. The reasons for the U.S. abandonment of the gold standard are roughly like this. The impact of this move on our country is that it can increase the people's purchasing power. When the U.S. dollar is expensive, goods priced at one U.S. dollar must be exchanged for four or five Chinese yuan. In the future, they may be able to be bought for two or three Chinese yuan. Also, U.S. books and machines are all needed by our country. After the devaluation, it is quite beneficial to China. Second, it can increase national tax revenue. After our country's purchasing power increases, foreign trade will gradually become active, and customs duties will also increase accordingly. However, the harm in this is also great. First, our country is an import-surplus country. The increase in imports is enough to hinder the development of the domestic industry, especially banks and industrial capitalists are the most disadvantaged. That is the first harm. Second, China's gold production has been almost exhausted in previous years. Now, because of the high price of silver, silver bars are continuing to flow out. The recent large-scale purchase of silver bars by foreign banks in Shanghai is clear proof of this. If this continues, it is inevitable that China's cash will run out. The government can issue strict orders to ban silver exports, but how to offset the repayment of foreign debts? Silver exports are likely to be banned by laws and regulations. As a result, China may be forced to become a paper currency standard. If the country changes to this point, the future is unbearable. (Special Dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Opposes German Rearmament</p>
<p>Washington Talks Show Results</p>
<p>Germany Still Insists on Equal Demands</p>
<p>The Future of Disarmament Faces Major Obstacles</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 28th - U.S. Representative Davis told the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference today that the United States will join other countries in refusing to overturn the British disarmament plan's amendments that are seeking to upset the balance of power. This statement by the U.S. representative is seen as the first result of the Washington talks and also as a sign that the United States has accepted the British plan, indicating that the Washington talks have gone further than official reports indicate. Davis's statement can also be seen as a warning to Germany, implying that the U.S. and Britain will not allow Germany to overturn the balance proposed by the British. The United States is determined to oppose Germany's rearmament.</p>
<p>At the same time, Germany also submitted an amendment today, suggesting expanding the elimination and destruction of defensive weaponry, expressing Germany's determination to demand equality. French Representative Massigli criticized the northern amendment, pointing out that it would destroy the British proposal. British Representative Eden also expressed surprise and said that he hoped that this amendment was not Germany's final word. The Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, British Representative Eden, and German Representative Nadolny will hold a private meeting tomorrow to try to resolve various difficulties.</p>
<p>▲ National, Geneva, 28th - At today's meeting of the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference, German Representative Nadolny announced Germany's principles for disarmament. Nadolny stated that what Germany is asking for is nothing more than that the armament of each country, as stipulated in Article 8 of the League of Nations Covenant, should be reduced to the lowest limit consistent with common security and implemented. Furthermore, Germany should enjoy the same rights and guarantees as other countries in terms of territorial security, which has already been recognized by all countries. The British Foreign Minister once urged France to be patient and trust the future of the Disarmament Conference. Nadolny praised him, saying that only Germany has made every effort to understand the sincerity of opinions clearly, because Germany has been patiently waiting for 14 years for the completion of the disarmament plan promised by the great powers, but so far, no other country has taken concrete steps to reduce armaments. Can Germany still be considered to lack the concept of harmonious cooperation? Moreover, the principle of equality demanded by Germany should have been implemented immediately, but other countries have agreed to a transitional period. Article 8 of the League of Nations Covenant clearly states that disarmament should be completed immediately, but Germany has also agreed to the gradual implementation of disarmament. Therefore, Germany is now fighting for justice and equality again, which is the root of trust. Nadolny then explained the various reservations that Germany had put forward regarding the British proposal, one by one. The general idea of Germany's reservations is even more advanced than the British proposal, such as aggressive armaments, military aircraft, etc. Germany requires that they all be abolished and destroyed. Germany is also accepting a five-year transitional period, but after this, the equal status that Germany demands in the disarmament treaty should be established in fact. If other countries consider certain armaments to be indispensable for national defense, then the same armaments should not be withheld from Germany alone. After Nadolny announced Germany's disarmament objectives, German and French representatives exchanged views, but their attitudes were very firm. The French representative believed that if Germany insisted on this position, the result would be expansion of armaments rather than reduction of armaments. If Germany persists to the end, then the future Disarmament Conference will never be successful. Nadolny immediately declared again that Germany has no intention of rearming, but for the sake of territorial security, it must have the same guarantees as other countries. The German representative's declaration and the fierce debate after the declaration have made a very deep impression on the League of Nations. It is said that today, the time has come for countries to no longer avoid the points demanded by Germany and must find a solution. Judging from the individual declarations of the U.S. and Britain, they seem to be taking joint action and strongly disapprove of the verbal warfare between Germany and France.</p>
<p>▲ National, Geneva, 29th - The World Disarmament</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Conference has been open for fifteen months, and not only has it achieved nothing, but it is also about to encounter a new impasse. If Germany does not agree to compromise, there will be no possibility of breaking the deadlock. Furthermore, if the conference wants to establish an important document, then the definite attitude of the United States towards the consultation convention must also be clarified. According to reports, after the German representative put forward the demand last night that the disarmament convention must include a clause on Germany's complete equality of armaments in 1938, French Representative Massigli stated today that Germany's demands are difficult to accept. If this is Germany's last word, then there is no hope for any disarmament convention to be established. However, judging from the German representative's statement yesterday that paper equality can never satisfy the Germans, and Germany must have military equality and full rights to military equipment, its attitude is indeed very firm. As for the United States' attitude towards the consultation convention, there has been no official statement other than a telegram stating that the United States is willing to sign a consultation convention that does not bear substantial obligations, indicating that the United States will only agree to the principle of consultation and is unwilling to guarantee any future action. However, the first clause of the disarmament convention proposed by MacDonald requires that countries such as Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia consult on joint action in accordance with the Non-Aggression Pact as a guarantee of security. The various obstacles that have arisen from the widespread unrest and suspicion in the world to agreeing to disarmament have not been slightly eliminated during Easter. The main ones are as follows: (1) France fears Hitler's Germany and the possible union of Germany and Austria, or the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Hungary, and therefore demands greater security as the price of disarmament; (2) Germany demands not only paper equality with France, but if France and its allies do not significantly disarm, Germany will rebuild its armaments; (3) The Little Entente fears the revision of treaties initiated by Germany and Italy; (4) Japan's militaristic behavior in the Far East makes countries with important interests in the Far East, such as Britain, the United States, and Russia, dare not greatly reduce their navies and air forces. Furthermore, China and Japan are of course not prepared to reduce their land, sea, and air forces; (5) The undeclared wars in South America also make representatives of South American countries hesitant to accept disarmament; (6) France and Italy have not joined the London Naval Treaty, making it impossible for Britain, the United States, and Japan to further reduce their navies; (7) Japan's statement that it wants to increase its naval ratio has further increased the sense of insecurity among countries. The above seven points are all major obstacles to the success of disarmament. As for the attitude of the United States, it is believed that although it will support genuine disarmament, it is unwilling to agree to join the actions of European countries to enforce the treaties they have concluded.</p>

<p>Bolivia Refuses Arbitration Solution</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Buenos Aires, 28th - The Bolivian government today sent a long message to the governments of Argentina and Chile, rejecting the two countries' suggestion that the dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay should be resolved by arbitration, stating that this delaying solution would particularly benefit Paraguay. It also said that if Paraguay or Bolivia relied on the mediation of a third party to resolve purely private matters, it would be ridiculed as not knowing what it was doing by the two countries at war. Paraguay and Bolivia are fighting over a corner of the Gran Chaco. On July 30 of last year, the Chairman of the Council of the League of Nations intervened and sent a telegram to the two governments, asking them to pay attention to international obligations and saying that the two governments have now signed the League of Nations Covenant and must not use this as an excuse to start a war. Later, Paraguay agreed to cease hostilities, but demanded that Bolivia withdraw from the occupied territory. Bolivia also agreed to a truce, but on the condition that it be allowed to retain the original territory. In February of this year, hostilities resumed between the two countries, and the League of Nations took a firm stance, sending a telegram to the two governments, urging them to conclude a ceasefire agreement quickly.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Remains of British Aviator Discovered in Remote Italian Mountains <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Florence, Italy, 28th: Law enforcement officials formally announced tonight that the wreckage of an aircraft discovered near Arezzo, along with a set of remains, has been confirmed to be those of British aviator Bert Hinkler. Hinkler departed from Feltham at 3:00 PM on January 7th, intending to set a new flight record between England and Australia. He subsequently disappeared without a trace. Today, Italian loggers discovered the wreckage of an aircraft in a remote area of the Apennine Mountains at an altitude of 4,600 feet. They immediately reported it to the police. According to information received by the British Embassy in Rome, the clothing on the deceased found in the plane was torn and tattered. He had a Canadian passport on his person, but the writing was blurred from exposure to the elements. Upon closer examination, it was identified as belonging to Hinkler. It is now believed that Hinkler died immediately upon impact, as the aircraft caught fire after the crash, and Hinkler's body was partially burned. The aircraft model was also identical to the one flown by Hinkler. It is therefore concluded that the deceased is undoubtedly Hinkler. Hinkler was the first person to fly solo across the South Atlantic Ocean from west to east. He was only forty years old. He was attempting to break the record of eight days, twenty hours, and forty-nine minutes for a flight between England and Australia, held by Scott, when he met this tragic end. It is indeed a loss for the British aviation community.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Florence, 28th: The site where Hinkler's aircraft crashed is five miles from the village of Monte Migliaio. Only a narrow path extending to the cliff face is passable, making it difficult to reach. The village only saw its first car two years ago. Hinkler's remains were found by a dog and had been partially eaten by wolves, resulting in dismembered limbs.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Florence, 29th: Hinkler's remains were wrapped in the Italian tricolor flag, with candles burning at his head and feet, and placed in the church of San Niccolò, guarded by huntsmen.</p>
<p>Many women are now entering the church to pray beside the body. It is said that the mountain where Hinkler met his fate is haunted by ghosts, and the villagers regard it with fear. Only those collecting charcoal occasionally venture up its slopes. It is now speculated that Hinkler must have been flying low at the time to search for a landing spot, but he inadvertently struck the mountainside, causing the crash. The aircraft was not severely damaged, but Hinkler was thrown out, his remains lying about seventy feet from the plane, buried in the snow until it melted and he was discovered. The Italian government will accord Hinkler's remains official honors.</p>

<p>From the 21st to the 26th</p>
<p>We Fight to the Death with Flesh and Blood Against Modern Weapons</p>
<p>The Center of the Battle is in the Nanti’anmen Area</p>
<p>Corpses Pile Up Like Small Hills in Front of Our Positions</p>
<p>Beijing Military News: Beginning at dawn on the 21st of this month, Japanese army infantry and artillery units, numbering approximately five to six thousand men, launched a fierce attack from the left flank of Gubeikou towards our Eight Towers and the North and South Xin'kai Ridge areas. At the same time, a large number of aircraft, together with heavy artillery, concentrated their bombardment on our Eight Towers high ground. Our defending soldiers fought to the death. The high ground was gained and lost several times. In the evening, both sides continued to engage in hand-to-hand combat under the cover of darkness. The Eight Towers was reduced to ashes due to the enemy's heavy bombing by numerous aircraft and artillery. At that time, our military casualties on the high ground amounted to over 1,200, including two battalion commanders killed and one seriously wounded. From 5:00 AM on the 22nd, the enemy launched another fierce attack, with part of their forces crossing the Chao River to attack our front. The enemy's artillery fire was exceptionally intense, and they fired over two hundred smoke bombs, using the smoke to launch their assault. Our troops also made use of the enemy's smoke to repeatedly counterattack, engaging the enemy in hand-to-hand combat up to five times. Corpses piled up like small hills in front of our positions. By 4:00 PM, the enemy, having repeatedly failed in their attacks, switched to concentrated artillery fire, continuously shelling key points of our positions. In the evening, they again used over a thousand infantrymen to attempt to outflank our left flank, North and South Xin'kai Ridge. Fortunately, our troops were prepared and immediately met them with a head-on assault, engaging in fierce fighting for several hours. The enemy was unable to withstand the attack and began to retreat towards the west side of Gubeikou. On this day, our military casualties included six company and platoon leaders killed and over six hundred soldiers killed or wounded. At 7:00 AM on the 23rd, seven enemy aircraft arrived over our positions and bombed them repeatedly. The enemy's heavy artillery again concentrated its fire, fiercely shelling our left flank positions at Nanti'anmen with over four hundred rounds. Later, at around 10:00 AM, they used smoke bombs to cover an infantry advance. Our troops waited for them to approach before opening fire with machine guns, followed by repeated hand-to-hand combat with hand grenades and bayonets four times. By 2:00 PM, our Eight Towers had been leveled by the enemy, and the company of infantry defending it perished together with the</p>

<p>high ground. None survived. The high ground was thus occupied by the enemy. On this day, our military casualties included seven company and platoon leaders killed or wounded, and over nine hundred soldiers killed or wounded. In the evening, the fighting subsided slightly, and the enemy's artillery fire also became less frequent. From 7:30 AM on the 24th, the enemy only used artillery fire to bombard us, and their infantry did not advance. At 2:00 PM, seven enemy aircraft arrived over our positions and dropped bombs. At the same time, their artillery fire gradually intensified, but the enemy only fired at our positions and dared not advance. Both sides remained locked in a stalemate until the evening. At night, the enemy's artillery still</p>

On this day, our military casualties included five company and platoon leaders and regimental adjutants killed or wounded, and six hundred soldiers. After dawn on the 25th, the enemy still used heavy artillery fire and five aircraft to cover approximately three thousand infantrymen in a fierce assault on our Nanti'anmen front and left flank. Our troops calmly resisted the enemy, inflicting many casualties. The enemy, having repeatedly failed in their attacks, became somewhat disheartened. After dusk, one of our units launched a counterattack, finally repelling the enemy's attack. On this day, our military casualties included six adjutants and company and platoon leaders killed or wounded, and approximately seven hundred soldiers. On the morning of the 26th, the front lines gradually fell silent. At 9:00 AM, the enemy's artillery resumed firing on our Nanti'anmen front positions. At 10:20 AM, two to three thousand of their infantrymen continued to attack, but the intensity of the attack was less than in previous days. At noon,</p>

<p>two more enemy aircraft flew from northeast of Gubeikou to the Shixia Miyun area to conduct reconnaissance, but they did not drop bombs. According to reports, the enemy in the Gubeikou area has now gradually increased to over one division and one brigade. As of 5:00 PM, a phone call from Miyun stated that fighting was still ongoing in the Nanti'anmen area. In total, during these six days of fierce fighting, our troops fought to the death with their flesh and blood against the enemy's modern weapons, resulting in particularly heavy casualties. According to statistics from Huang's division, which was defending Nanti'anmen, the number of officers and soldiers killed or wounded has reached over four thousand. The enemy's cost has also been considerable.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Reasons for the Japanese Army's Withdrawal from Eastern Hebei <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Army Transports Troops to Northern Manchuria to Deal with Soviet Russia</p>
<p>We Take Advantage of the Vacancy to Attack and Recapture Lost Territory in Eastern Hebei</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beijing: In recent days, tensions between Japan and Russia have escalated over the issue of Central Eastern Railway vehicles, with Russia and its puppet regime exchanging protests and engaging in heated written exchanges. The situation is becoming increasingly dire, with the possibility of Japan and Russia resorting to force. According to sources in Shenyang, although Soviet Russia has remained silent since the September 18th Incident, the situation has become critical as the Japanese side has instigated the establishment of a puppet state. The Russian authorities have repeatedly issued unofficial statements, indicating their willingness to risk their Five-Year Plan and engage in war. The Japanese side has also been secretly planning and preparing countermeasures. When the issue of vehicle seizures on the Central Eastern Railway arose, long-accumulated grievances could no longer be suppressed. In recent days, the Japanese army has redeployed a division from Japan, landing in Dalian and actively transporting them to northern Manchuria. A large amount of military supplies, such as aircraft, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, and ammunition, are also being transported with the troops. Japanese soldiers are also carrying items such as gas masks. The equipment they are carrying is mostly of the latest type. Their intentions are self-evident. At the same time, the Soviet Russian side has dispatched a large army of twelve divisions to Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Chita, and the Amur region, and is also carrying out border immigration, transporting a large number of Russian civilians to garrison in the border areas as the front line of the Soviet Russian defense forces. More than 300 aircraft have been transported to Vladivostok and other places, which is particularly alarming to the Japanese side. As a result, the Japanese side had to hastily withdraw its troops from various places in eastern Hebei. Our troops were able to take advantage of the vacancy to attack and recapture the lost territories in eastern Hebei. Another theory is that the Japanese army's retreat is due to the upcoming Washington Conference. If they were to occupy Tianjin and Beijing at this time, it would infringe upon the interests of Britain and the United States in northern China, on the one hand causing a major international reaction, and on the other hand, the extension of the front line would make it difficult to balance economic and military strength. Therefore, they are thinking of taking the opportunity to change course and find other solutions. If this theory is credible, then the Japanese army's retreat this time has another purpose.

<h3 id="e93">Nanchang Fortifies City Defenses <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Conscripting Laborers to Construct City Defense Transportation Roads</p>
<p>Various Construction Costs Estimated at Approximately 120,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: All sectors of this city believe that amidst the crisis of the Red Bandits taking advantage of the Japanese army's advance on western Hebei, they have also launched a full-scale invasion from eastern Jiangxi. Nancheng, Yihuang, and Chongren have simultaneously issued urgent warnings. Linchuan and Dongxiang are also under considerable pressure. If Nanchang is not secured, the southeastern half of the province will be unimaginable. All sectors of the United Anti-Bandit Association convened a meeting on the 24th to discuss methods to consolidate provincial defenses and eliminate the Red Bandits. Attendees included representatives from various civic groups, commercial and academic circles, and local elders Hu Siyi (former Governor of Jiangxi Province), Peng Chengwan (former Military Governor of Jiangxi Province), and dozens of others. Xiong Shihui also attended and was present. Chairman Fan presided over the meeting and resolved to conscript laborers from this city to complete city defenses and send representatives to petition the Central Government, requesting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to be stationed in Jiangxi Province to personally supervise the suppression of bandits. The original proposal is recorded below: (1) Chairman Xiong reported that he had inspected the city defense works of this city with Chairman He of Hunan Province yesterday and felt that they were not yet adequate. Nanchang is the provincial capital, and city defenses should be strengthened urgently. It is now planned to actively carry out the construction of moats, fortresses, transportation roads, and various city defense works to achieve a permanent solution. This will have a significant effect on military affairs, and a great benefit to the development of this city and transportation. It is now calculated that the most economical method will require more than 100,000 yuan for weapons, barbed wire, etc., about 200,000 yuan for dredging ditches, and about 100,000 yuan for fifty miles of transportation roads. Now that the government is determined to complete this important work, it is making every effort to save all expenses and cover them, but it is still short more than 100,000 yuan, and the situation is urgent. In order not to increase the burden on the people, and to achieve rapid results in practice, it is proposed to emulate the methods of other counties in conscripting labor to build roads, conscripting laborers from Nanchang City to build city defense transportation roads. This will not cost money and will demonstrate a sound spirit. However, regarding this conscription method, whether it is appropriate and feasible, everyone is urged to discuss it together with the intention of assisting in bandit suppression and concern for the local area. (Resolution) City defense transportation roads are necessary and should be built urgently. Committee members Li Shangyong and Peng Chengwan were elected to contact the highway department and the security bureau to jointly plan the conscription method. If conscripting labor is difficult, the association will assist in the construction, with the city defense construction cost being 120,000 yuan. (2) Committee members Huang Wenzhi and He Zhihuan proposed that other provinces generally consider the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi to be unimportant and regard it as a local problem. The association should make the whole country understand that the bandit disaster in Jiangxi is at stake for the survival of the entire Chinese nation, and request unanimous support to eliminate the Red Bandits as soon as possible in order to resist Japan with all our strength. Please make a resolution. (Resolution) A. Send representatives to the Central Government to request additional troops to Jiangxi to suppress the bandits. B. Telegraph the whole country, explaining the severity of the bandit disaster and its relationship to the survival of the entire nation, and separately telegraph Jiangxi native associations in various other provinces to petition the National Government to save the province. C. Petition Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to temporarily reside in Jiangxi to supervise the suppression of bandits until the Red Bandits are eliminated. (2) Chairman Tai proposed that all central government agencies stationed in the province should also follow the example of the two-tenths donation method for provincial civil servants from February to show assistance and set an example. (Resolution) Send separate letters to the central government agencies stationed in Jiangxi to follow the example. Other cases omitted. (April 25th)</p>

<p>Bandit Army Chief of Staff Shen Zixiang Killed</p>
<p>Ammunition and Food Depleted, Internal Panic Occurs</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The commander of the Communist Bandit's Third Army, He Long, has been disrupting the border areas of Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Sichuan for many years, without being eliminated. Last winter, after suffering losses in Hubei, he led his remnants to occupy the mountainous areas of the Shihhe, Longsang, and areas bordering Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan. It has been several months. The Hubei army under Fan Xiji and the Hunan army under Chen Quzhen have been ordered to jointly suppress the bandits and are currently surrounding them. Yesterday, Chen Cexun, the magistrate of Sangzhi County and the captain of the security brigade, reported to He Jian about the internal clashes of He Long, as well as the depletion of ammunition and food among the bandit troops. The report is recorded as follows: (Respectfully submitted for the perusal of He Junjian, Chairman of the Changsha Provincial Government: (1) The Red Bandits Duan Dechang, Wang Bingnan, and the puppet Third Army Chief of Staff Shen Zixiang (from Zhejiang) were indeed killed by He Long in the Jinguoping area bordering Hefeng and Badong, labeled as being killed by the reorganization faction. (2) The puppet Third Army is now reorganized into the Seventy-ninth Division and a training regiment. The commander of the Seventy-ninth Division, Ye Guangji, and the political commissar, Shen Wen, are from Anxiang Township. The commander of the Ninety-ninth Division, Tang Fulin, is from Sangzhi. The political commissar, Song Panming, and the commander of the training regiment, Lu Dongsheng, are from Xiangtan. Each division has three regiments, each regiment has three companies, with no battalion system. Each company has 50-60 people, and the training regiment has about 700 people. The total number of combat troops is no more than 2,500 people. Except for the training regiment, each soldier has 5-6 clips of ammunition, and the rest have less than 10 rounds per gun. (3) The puppet Third Army political commissar Tao Xiangying (from Manchuria) was sent by Soviet Russia to work with the puppet Third Army's central sub-district chairman Xia Xi (from Yiyang) in the Third Army. Tao and Xia are in control of the puppet army. (4) Most of the puppet army soldiers are from the Hubei, Damen, and Qianjiang areas. The people are very panicked. (5) The bandit troops are short of ammunition and food, and they rely on looting local tyrants for daily living. They recently invaded the Wudaoshui area of Sangzhi because the bandits reported that Sangzhi had no garrison. After hearing that the garrison had not withdrawn, they immediately withdrew to Maoba, which belongs to Hefeng. I believe that the bandits have become fish in a kettle, and once Heaven sends an army, they can be eliminated immediately. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that must not be missed. I humbly request that a brigade of troops be dispatched quickly at this time to thoroughly suppress them. This will achieve twice the result with half the effort, and we can rely on their elimination soon. This is respectfully submitted for your review.

<p>Although it Rained Once, Wheat Seedlings Withered</p>
<p>Disaster Victims Unable to Farm, Continued Hope for Relief</p>
<p>Xi'an Correspondence: Since last winter, Shaanxi has not seen a drop of rain for several months, and the disaster situation is once again becoming severe. Up until the 23rd of last month, there was a welcome rainfall, and the wheat seedlings showed some hope of recovery. However, eight or nine out of ten had already withered and died. Furthermore, there were no seeds or farming tools to sow autumn crops, leaving the disaster victims lost and without a path to take. There was no way to escape, and no way to return. There were also those who heard rumors of relief and returned to their villages to seek survival, only to find that there was little porridge for many people. They waited for many days without</p>
<p>receiving anything, and some even starved to death as a result. This is particularly tragic and unbearable. Therefore, at this time of year when the old grain has run out and the new grain has not yet ripened, the disaster situation is becoming increasingly severe, and the hope for relief is greater than ever before. If no measures are taken to overcome this difficult situation,</p>
<p>the tragic situation will be even more unimaginable. The disaster conditions in various places after the rain are specially recorded in detail below. It is hoped that those who care about the Shaanxi disaster will pay attention to it.</p>

<p>The county is located on a plateau, with no land that can be irrigated. Even when there is timely rainfall, households with little land often worry about not having enough. This time, after five years of drought, no crops were harvested. Even the formerly prosperous families have run out of food. The situation of the middle and lower classes can be imagined. Now, farming tools, clothing, trees, and houses have all been sold, leaving them with nothing to live on. Beggars fill the land and line the streets, and abandoned children cry everywhere, their voices exhausted, with no one willing to care for them. Selling daughters and wives has become a marketplace. Some die of hunger, others die in war. There are unburied corpses in the villages. Some migrate north to Gansu, others migrate south to Sichuan. There are few settled families along the villages. It is estimated that the population of Qian County is no less than 170,000 to 180,000. Those who remain are only six or seven out of ten, but they still do not cook during the day and guard against bandits at night. Their hardship and suffering are difficult to describe. As for the porridge kitchens providing relief, those who hold receipts to receive porridge are all emaciated and barely clothed. Those who do not have receipts number about several thousand. The strong stand on tiptoe, craning their necks, like hungry ghosts seeking food. The old and weak lie on the ground, heads bowed, like prisoners awaiting death. They guard the kitchens all day and wail all night, demanding an increase in porridge tickets and licking the spilled porridge on the ground outside the pots. The tragic situation cannot be described in detail.</p>

<p>Last year, in July, this county received urgent relief from the great philanthropist of Tianjin and the Shanghai Red Swastika Society. Many of those who received aid escaped to seek survival. The remaining elderly, weak, women, and children could not escape and could not survive. In the cold winter, they were about to starve to death. Later, philanthropists from Tianjin set up a porridge kitchen in Xinglin Town, issuing only 1,850 porridge tickets. Due to the small amount of porridge for many people, some who waited starved to death. It was too horrible to look upon. Who would have thought that this spring, disaster victims who had escaped to other places heard about the establishment of porridge kitchens and the distribution of relief, and more and more returned to their villages to seek relief. Although it has been raining in recent days, the villages have been reduced to rubble, and the vegetable roots have long been eaten. The summer harvest is already hopeless, and tens of thousands are waiting to be fed.</p>

<p>Xingping is located on a plateau, and the disaster situation has been extremely severe in recent years. No eight grains have been harvested, and the farmers' economy has collapsed. Those who tear down houses and sell wives and children are too numerous to count. Although there has been welcome rainfall recently, the time for sowing autumn crops is not far off. However, extremely poor families still cannot get a single meal, and their lives are in danger. There are many such families.</p>

<p>Baoji has experienced continuous drought for years, and no harvests have been gathered. Countless disaster victims in the entire county have died or been displaced. The elderly, weak, women, and children beg from door to door, a pathetic sight. Although there has been rain recently, there are no seeds, so there are many who cannot plant their land.</p>

<p>Due to the prolonged drought in Fengxiang, the number of disaster victims fleeing is increasing daily. Those who have not fled have exhausted their food due to banditry. They are now digging and eating vegetable roots, and both hosts and guests are fighting over them, all falling into a sea of suffering. Therefore, they are also craning their necks and awaiting rescue.</p>

<p>Wujiatun in Lintong has experienced continuous drought for years, and the summer and autumn harvests are uncertain. Coupled with disasters such as wind and insects and plagues, the situation is even more unspeakable. Of the existing population, only two or three out of ten remain. Although there has been welcome rainfall recently, the disaster victims still go hungry all day long, and those who starve to death by the roadside are seen everywhere. The situation is extremely tragic.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Chengcheng <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Chengcheng is located in the remote foothills of northeastern Shaanxi Province. The land is barren and the people are poor. Even in good years, there is a risk of famine. After the seventeenth year of the Republic, it has suffered successive droughts. More than half of the people in the countryside have fled, leaving thousands of miles of red land and abandoned villages. Although there has been light rain from heaven recently, the tree bark and vegetable roots have already been dug up and eaten. The remaining disaster victims still have no way to make a living.</p>

<p>In Heyang County, there were black frosts on the first, second, tenth, and eleventh of March, with the wheat and bean seedlings withering immediately. Grain prices soared. Although there was some rain during the vernal equinox, it was too little, too late. Recently, deaths and migrations have been heard of daily. And city and rural markets are full of people selling odd items, such as farming tools, furniture, old clothes, and toys. Few pay any attention. A cow or horse is worth only a few dollars. The severity of the disaster is too horrible to look upon.</p>

<p>The disaster situation in the county is worsening daily. Everyone is out of food, and every household has run out of grain. The number of starving people who need relief to survive is at least 20,000. Deaths are increasing, and the situation has already evolved to the state it was in last year.</p>

<p>The territory of Qian County is full of mountains and ridges and has always been known to be barren and poor. There is a saying, "Qianyang and Longzhou, harvest nine out of ten years, and if one year is not harvested, you have to leave on your back." The thinness of its production can be imagined. Recently, the impact of drought and locusts has made the situation even more unbearable. Many have fled. An investigation of the county's population of more than 11,000 households revealed that before the rain, it was heard that more than half had fled, which is alarming. Although it has rained now, the wheat seedlings had mostly withered before the rain, and the harvest is still hopeless. Therefore, the lives of the general public are extremely difficult, reaching the extreme point. They are emaciated and the situation is extremely tragic.</p>

<p>Murder Case Occurs in the City</p>
<p>Sun Yaoshan, who runs a sugar mill on the south bank of the river, was having lunch at the Kunshan Restaurant at noon on the 28th with friends Chen Mubao and the monk Zhong Xiao. Sun, because Zhong was having an affair with his concubine, cursed at Zhong while drunk and then became violent. People persuaded them to stop and they dispersed. At 2:00 PM, the two met again in front of the Kunshan Theatre and repeated the fight. Zhong then took out a small axe he had hidden and slashed Sun in the neck, causing blood to flow like a fountain. Zhong, seeing the trouble he had caused, took the opportunity to escape. Sun was taken to the Guangren Hospital by friends for treatment. Doctor Gu used surgery to ligate the wound, but the main artery had been severed, and Sun died at 4:00 PM. Cheng Ruji, the director of the Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the news, immediately ordered the detective team to supervise and dispatch detectives to search for the perpetrator. He also dispatched police to take Chen Mubao and Wei Jinrong, Han Yun, and Long, who were at the scene trying to mediate, to the bureau to be interrogated in the county. He ordered personnel to examine the body in the morning and gave the detective team a deadline to capture the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>

He immediately informed Principal Zhou, who reported it to the local public security substation and the Education Bureau. They are investigating the cause of Qian's death. Family members arrived at the school after hearing the news and transported the body back for burial. The cause of death is still unknown.</p>

Upon retrieving the body, it was discovered that all the silver ornaments on his body had been taken. The Second Police Station of the Public Security Bureau reported the case and quickly identified Gu Wangshi and a monk named Chen as the main suspects. They were handed over to the County Court Procuratorate for interrogation. On the 28th, the supervising prosecutor led officials to conduct an autopsy, which confirmed that the child had been suffocated to death and then dumped into the river.

<p>Boats Robbed on the Wuxi-Changzhou Route</p>
<p>A night boat, owned by boatman Zhu A’gen, has been operating between Wuxi and Changzhou, passing through the Mei Yan Bridge area, for some time. The boat was fully loaded with goods and passengers and departed from Xueqian the other day for Wuxi. However, when it reached Baishi Mountain in Wuxi, three bandits disguised as passengers pulled out handguns and ordered the boat to stop. The boatman had no choice but to order the crew to dock the boat. Unexpectedly, four or five more bandits jumped onto the boat from the shore and began a large-scale search and robbery. Passengers were robbed of over one hundred silver dollars, and goods worth a total of 326.50 yuan were stolen. After plundering, the bandits boarded a small boat on the opposite bank and rowed away. Boatman Zhu A’gen, seeing that the bandits were far away, quickly sent a crew member ashore to report to the Xue Yan Bridge Security Corps. Upon receiving the report, Wu Zongjie, the head of the Corps, immediately dispatched militiamen to guard the Li Jiang Kou. Upon receiving the news, the Hu Dai Commercial Corps also dispatched a team to encircle and pursue the bandits from both Bai Shi Mountain and Qing Ming Bridge, but without success.</p>
<p>Investigation and Arrest of Villagers for Selling Poison Pills Causes Uproar</p>
<p>The local Narcotics Investigation Office dispatched two inspectors, accompanied by armed patrol officers, by boat to Yang Fushun's residence in Tianshangshi, District Five, where they discovered a large number of opium quitting pills. Yang was taken aboard the boat. Subsequently, they raided a red pill den in Tangtou Town, District Six, and also took the owner of the den, Zhang, and his partner, A, aboard the boat. Unexpectedly, when they arrived near Miaoshutou, over 300 villagers suddenly appeared, claiming that the investigators were harassing the people and demanding that the investigators and the boat be detained. During the commotion, the red pills and the three arrested individuals, including Yang, were released by the villagers. Later, the inspectors reported the incident to Director Chen in the city, who forwarded the report to Director Shen of the Jiangsu Provincial Narcotics Investigation Office, who ordered a strict investigation and arrests. Director Chen, upon receiving the order, immediately dispatched Team Leader Gong Guilin and Inspector Shen Dehua, leading police officers to the countryside to investigate and make arrests. However, before Team Leader Gong and his men arrived at Miaoshutou, the villagers had already heard the news and gathered hundreds of people again, preparing to cause an uproar. The officers arrested six individuals who had caused trouble: Guo Yuexuan, Guo Xingbao, Guo Ziqin, Liu Honggen, Guo Daoshi, and the village head, Guo Jinchen, and took them to the investigation office for processing. After questioning them, Director Chen ordered the release of village head Guo Jinchen on bail, as he was deemed to be uninvolved, while the other five were detained pending further review.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Ministry of Finance to Rectify the Farmland Tax Surtax Law <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Four Key Points to be Implemented Soon</p>
<p>Since the administration of farmland tax was delegated to local authorities, provinces have not made significant changes to the regular tax, but have arbitrarily increased surtaxes levied along with the regular tax, increasing the burden on the people. The Ministry of Finance, recognizing this, has long followed the teachings of the Premier Sun Yat-sen and formulated measures to limit surcharges, issuing repeated orders for compliance. However, local governments often use additional farmland tax as a source of revenue when implementing new policies, increasing the surtax day by day, to the point where it is several times the regular tax, with no end in sight. They even create ingenious names and issue separate receipts to avoid responsibility for violating the law. The people have repeatedly appealed to the central government, and although the Ministry of Finance has corrected this from time to time, the provinces have not fully complied. At the Second National Internal Affairs Conference of this session, the Ministry of Finance made a special proposal on this matter, and has recently drafted several articles of a draft law to rectify the farmland tax surtax based on the proposal, which has been passed by a meeting of relevant ministries and commissions and is expected to be implemented soon. Its key points can be divided into four categories: (1) The combined regular tax and surtax must not exceed 1% of the land value. In counties where land value has not been assessed, the surcharge should not exceed the regular tax for the time being. (2) All mu taxes and items levied with the tax shall be considered surcharges. (3) A deadline for rectification is specified, requiring completion by the deadline. (4) When necessary, the Ministry of Finance may send personnel to jointly rectify with the local government to gradually bring local finances into order.</p>

<p>Research on Yellow Fever is Prohibited</p>
<p>Specialized Schools to be Established for Malaria</p>
<p>The Eastern Affairs Advisory Committee of the Health Organization of the International League of Nations held a general meeting of its members in Singapore at the end of last month to discuss health issues in Eastern countries. China sent Mr. Wu Liande, Director of the Harbor Quarantine Office, to attend the meeting as a representative. Mr. Wu has completed his mission and returned to Shanghai on the 22nd of this month. The reporter of the Dabaisha newspaper made a special visit to Mr. Wu at the Harbor Quarantine Office yesterday morning and asked him for details on the proceedings of the meeting. Mr. Wu informed us as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e123">No Research on Yellow Fever <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Wu, the Eastern Health Advisory Committee of the International League of Nations is composed of representatives from Eastern countries and specializes in discussing Eastern health issues. A general meeting is held every two years. This session was held in Singapore last month. China sent me as a representative to attend the meeting, which began in Singapore on the 21st of last month. Thirteen countries participated in the meeting, which lasted four days. The most important issues discussed were three: The first point was yellow fever. This disease is virulent, and once it infects a human body, it is difficult to treat. It spreads very quickly, leading to death. It originates in places such as Africa and South America, and it is not easily transmitted to distant places. However, due to the convenience of transportation, there is a danger of it spreading widely. Therefore, the general meeting decided that places where this disease has not yet occurred should not research this disease. If this bacterium is researched, the bacterium may be sucked up by mosquitoes and fly to various places with airplanes, and it can be widely spread at any time, which is extremely dangerous.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Schools for Malaria <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Malaria is a common disease in various countries at present. However, this disease is difficult to treat once infected, and it is especially difficult to eradicate. Various countries feel that it is necessary to conduct in-depth research on this disease. Therefore, it was decided to establish a malaria school in Singapore, and countries will select medical students who have already graduated from medical schools and experienced doctors to attend the school to specialize in researching various perfect methods for preventing and treating malaria. The research period is tentatively set for one year, after which they will return to their countries to implement the methods to rapidly eliminate malaria.</p>

<p>Cholera is one of the most prevalent, rapidly spreading, and dangerous diseases in various countries. The speed of death is truly shocking. Treatment methods are often delayed, making it impossible to save patients. More than 20% of those suffering from cholera in various countries die. In our country, because we administer preventive injections before cholera occurs and administer saline injections for emergency treatment when it occurs, we prioritize speed. Therefore, the death rate is only 7%. Various countries are very surprised by this. After I explained our country's treatment methods, various countries greatly praised it.</p>

<p>No Reply Yet to Shanghai Municipal Government's Protest</p>
<p>Our Side is Determined to Strive to the End</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement intends to obtain the right to inspect our country's factories by amending the Annex to the Yangjingbang Regulations. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, in addition to making a solemn statement on the 20th of this month based on historical, legal, and factual grounds, that the entire labor administrative power must be insisted upon and striven for, also submitted a formal protest on the 16th to the consuls-general in Shanghai of 21 countries, including England, America, France, Japan, and Italy. As of yesterday, it was heard that the Municipal Government had not yet received a reply. The news obtained by the Xinxin News Agency reporter yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>

<p>After receiving Mayor Wu's formal letter of protest, the consuls stationed in Shanghai, in addition to exchanging informal opinions among themselves, immediately telegraphed the key points of Mayor Wu's protest to the ambassadors of their respective countries in China and the diplomatic authorities in their respective home countries, awaiting a reply before scheduling a discussion on a response. However, according to other news, the Shanghai Consular Body will submit the issue of responding to the Municipal Government's protest for discussion at its regular meeting next month in order to make a decision.</p>

<p>Since receiving Mayor Wu's report, the central authorities have generally agreed that the Council's move is related to the national administrative sovereignty, and the government cannot relax a single step. Therefore, the Central Civil Movement Committee and the Ministry of Industry have sent personnel to Shanghai to discuss countermeasures with the Shanghai Municipal Government. In addition to filing a protest, it has been decided to wait for the Shanghai Consular Body's response before determining the negotiation strategy. If a satisfactory solution cannot be reached within a reasonable period, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will formally file a protest with the ambassadors of the relevant countries in China. At the same time, our country's representatives attending the International Labor Conference to be held in Geneva on June 8th this year will also raise the issue at that time to seek a ruling based on international justice.</p>

The original telegram is recorded as follows: "Commander Shang's troops have been working extremely hard in combat, and they have suffered heavy casualties in the battles at Lengkou. The central government has provided them with full replenishment, and because the troops have other missions, they have been specially reassigned elsewhere. The talk of dismissal is purely a fabrication by the Japanese and is not credible."</p>

<p>Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen, based on a confidential report, learned that communists were hiding in the Public Settlement and the French Settlement of this city, attempting to carry out activities, incite workers, and disrupt order. Chief Wen, upon receiving the report, ordered the Bureau's staff, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the police stations, to go to the addresses and arrested a large number of male and female communists, including Qin Qiwan, Zhang Qifu (also known as Zhang Zhihong), Huang Qiang (also known as Chen Guohua), Wu Suzhou (also known as Wu Yue), Xia Zixu, Peng Zhuhan (also known as Wang Li), Wang De, Zhu Ying, Zhang Ximeng (also known as Zhang Wen), and Liang Maokang, and seized various reactionary publications. All were taken to the Bureau and handed over to the interrogation section of the Third Department for separate and thorough investigation. It is now known that the section has determined that the crimes of the communists Qin Qiwan and others are true. Chief Wen reported to the Municipal Government for instructions and was ordered to escort them to Beijing for legal proceedings. Therefore, at 11:45 PM the other night, all the criminals were escorted to Beijing on the overnight express train on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway.

<p>Publishes Declaration Stating Past Mistakes</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Luo Zhanglong, also known as Luo Aojie, the Communist who recently defected in Shanghai, was originally scheduled to report on his defection at the Municipal Government Information Office yesterday morning. However, because he went to Beijing the other day and was unable to return in time, Ma Shaowu, a special investigator stationed in Shanghai by the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, gave the statement on his behalf. Luo himself also published a declaration of defection. Excerpts are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e137">Ma Shaowu: Statement on Behalf of Luo <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Luo Zhanglong, formerly known as Aojie, is 32 years old and from Dongxiang, Liuyang County, Hunan Province. He graduated from the Department of Philosophy at Peking University. In 1923 (the 12th year of the Republic of China), he joined the Communist Party during the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. Later, he was expelled by the Cadre Faction for opposing the Communist Party's violent policy. Luo then established his own faction and organized the Extraordinary Committee, which was not related to Chen Duxiu's Trotskyist faction. Luo has been working secretly in Shanghai for several years. He was arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau at the Commercial Library of Tianhougong Bridge, and after explaining the mistakes of the Chinese Communist Party to him, Luo defected. With Sun Zhengyi and Peng Yujie as guarantors, he was escorted to Beijing by personnel sent by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He is currently temporarily residing at the Central Party Department Reception Center and has regained his freedom. Mr. Cai Yuanpei had previously requested bail from the Central Government in the name of the Civil Rights Protection League, but he did not know that Luo had already obtained his freedom. Luo himself also issued a declaration, expressing his past mistakes and future efforts. Luo has studied politics and economics and has published many works. It is hoped that he can work for the Party and the country in the future, which will also be welcomed by us.</p>

<p>The Chinese Revolution is now encountering a severe historical crisis. Since the September 18th Incident the year before last, the life-and-death issue of the entire nation has been placed before every citizen. Recently, the brutal aggression of Japanese imperialism in the North has further spurred unanimous indignation throughout the country. Considering the current situation, saving the precarious fate of the Chinese nation hinges on the sincere unity of the entire nation and a planned resistance against imperialism. The Chinese National Revolution must also be thoroughly completed through this. This is an indisputable principle. However, precisely during the development of the war of resistance against Japan, the policies of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are in direct opposition to this, causing significant constraints on the government. Based on this major, real event, and after a long period of deep consideration, I firmly believe that the Third International, which currently leads the CCP, is absolutely incapable of undertaking the task of the Chinese Revolution and, on the contrary, has become an obstacle to it. The completion of the Chinese Revolution can only be realized by relying on the guidance of the Three Principles of the People and the leadership of the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT). Therefore, I now resolutely declare my departure from the CCP, abandoning my previous political prejudices, acknowledging all the mistakes I have made in the past, and bravely transitioning to the banner of the Three Principles of the People, becoming a combatant against communism and resisting Japan to complete the National Revolution. Now, I will briefly narrate my transition process as follows. In the early stages of the introduction of socialism into China, I began to study socialism. Subsequently, through the introduction of Li Dazhao, I joined the CCP in Beijing. I successively participated in activities among students and workers. Over the years, I held positions in branches, district committees, provincial committees, and central departments. At that time, with pure faith and ardent expectations for the world revolution, I worked diligently for communism, often standing on the front lines of struggles. When the issue of KMT-CCP cooperation arose, intense disputes occurred within the CCP. At this time, I once participated in KMT work. I experienced great wavering regarding the theory of "Communist Revolution versus National Revolution." After the failure of the CCP in 1927, it adopted an anarchist policy of violent uprisings, treating murder and arson as child's play, committing heinous crimes. At that time, I immediately believed that the CCP's path (which was actually the path of the Third International) had completely departed from China's actual needs and ran counter to the interests of the people. As a result of severely criticizing this absurd policy, I was subjected to various slanders by the CCP Central Committee. At the CCP's Sixth National Congress, the CCP's policy of violent uprisings was revived in the form of a false "Three Lines." I also suffered their attacks for continuing to resist. In 1930, when the CCP held the Fourth Plenary Session, I, along with Xu Xigen, Wang Kequan, Sun Zhengyi, and others, rose up in opposition and organized the Extraordinary Committee. Due to the failure of our resistance, we were</p>
<p>expelled from the CCP. Since then, my attitude towards politics has</p>
<p>become one of disappointment and passivity. However, I still retained a glimmer of hope, hoping that the CCP could discover a more correct path and solve the problem of the Chinese Revolution. Subsequently, this hope gradually disappeared. When the Extraordinary Committee was disbanded, and later when I attempted to restore it, I was extremely pessimistic and distressed in politics, and my political life came to a standstill. However, this led me to begin thinking about various fundamental issues of the revolution. Looking at it now, over the years, in politics and organization, I have seen through that the actions of the Third International and the CCP it leads are completely unsuited to the Chinese Revolution. I have understood that China is currently facing both foreign aggression and internal troubles, and the people are suffering immensely. The CCP bears a major responsibility. At this time, I was unable to fundamentally break with it and still wanted to seek remedies under the influence of its errors. This was not only a personal subjective error but also ignorance of objective truth. I now bravely acknowledge this error and am willing to reveal its most important points. First, China is a semi-colonial country. China's economy has long been under the control of international capitalism, and a strong national capital has not been formed. Fundamentally, the conditions for communist collective production do not exist. Therefore, the nature of the Chinese Revolution is primarily to eliminate feudal remnants internally and expel the forces of imperialism in China externally, so as to develop the economy and stabilize people's livelihoods. At the same time, the driving force of the Chinese Revolution should be the united strength of all classes, striving together to eliminate powerful enemies and complete the task. However, the CCP, based on the erroneous estimation of the Third International, disregarded all objective facts and arbitrarily issued a call to establish Soviet power, denying the existence of revolutionary forces other than the proletariat. This kind of transplantation of foreign, unrealistic theories resulted in the establishment of so-called Soviet power only causing widespread massacres, deaths, famines, and bankruptcies in rural areas. The launching of strikes, disputes, and armed uprisings in urban areas plunged the toiling masses into the same tragic fate. This fundamental error naturally created the main source of all other evils and formed the main reactionary current in the country. Second, the policies of the CCP all stem directly from the Third International. However, based on past observations, the errors of the Third International regarding the Chinese problem have been mentioned above. Moreover, its tactical inconsistency and constant contradictions are too numerous to count. The CCP's several performances of "opportunism" all</p>
<p>had the factions of the Third International as their backdrop. Furthermore, it always shifted the blame to individual members of the CCP, fueling internal strife within the CCP to facilitate its manipulation. At the same time, since 1918, after the Third International's hope for assistance from the Western European proletarian revolution was disappointed, all its foreign policies shifted to centering on supporting the Soviet Union. Consequently, it colluded with France and Japan and advanced its troops into the Middle East Railway. Its so-called assistance to weak and small nations and the carrying out of world revolution became nothing more than a pleasant-sounding term. Under the guidance and deception of the Third International, the Chinese Revolution was simply reduced to a sacrifice for supporting the Soviet Union. Third, the CCP's ignorant theories and its inherited selfish and arrogant policies of the Third International, repeatedly proven by the facts of more than a decade, are definitive proof that it will never become a "proletarian party." Therefore, the CCP is often like a structure built on sand; its foundation is completely empty and fluid. It not only lacks the support of the majority of the people but also cannot be said to be the vanguard of the revolution. On the contrary, genuine revolutionaries are now increasingly hostile to and leaving it. Only a few party officials are still falsely setting up organizations, hoping to build some kind of foundation on this ruin. This is nothing more than deceiving themselves and will ultimately lead to destruction. Fourth, the CCP's arrogant theories and distorted organization, needless to say, are bound to be buried in the development of the correct revolutionary path. However, even today, it is still actively exerting its counter-revolutionary efforts. Amidst the nationwide economic panic and the difficulties that surround it, what they are doing most vigorously is dashing east and west within the bandit-controlled areas, restraining the government's anti-Japanese forces to serve their narrow selfish goals. They are causing disturbances in all rural areas, taking advantage of the chaos to loot and plunder. In the production sector, they are creating disturbances, hindering production, and increasing unemployment. All of this can be interpreted today as pro-foreign behavior that is hostile to the national anti-imperialist front. However, they use various excuses to slander the ruling KMT for all this pro-foreign behavior. Based on the above points, I firmly believe that the First International and the CCP are, objectively speaking, reactionary groups in the history of the Chinese Revolution. A strict critique of my past participation in this group's words and actions naturally reveals my sins. I also deeply regret that in recent years, many young people have lost their political direction and suffered the same fate under the leadership of the CCP, which is full of errors, and have made huge sacrifices. Thus, after lengthy consideration and the KMT authorities' earnest explanations, I am today completely extricated from the mire of the CCP.</p>
<p>I correctly understand that the Three Principles of the People has a political program of action that is in line with the current political reality of China, as well as lofty and great goals and ideals. The ruling KMT has a glorious history in the Chinese Revolution and is currently supported by the broad masses. The urgent political issues in China today are to resolutely resist Japan and suppress communism under the leadership of the KMT government, to open up a new path for the nation, to reconcile class contradictions, to replace riots and terror, to implement a planned economy, to improve rural life, and to establish a new country that is of the people, by the people, and for the people.

<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, in light of Mr. Zheng Yanfen, Secretary of the League of Nations, recently returning to China from Geneva to investigate the domestic opium situation, held a welcome reception at the Deng Tuomo Hotel on Sichuan Road at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday. Those in attendance included committee members of the association: Wang Jingqi, Li Denghui, Shen Junru, Ding Shujing, Yin Zhufu, Chu Huiseng (acting), Huang Jia-Hui, etc. Chairman Wang Jingqi began by giving a welcoming speech. Then, Mr. Zheng Yanfen stood up and reported on the League of Nations' handling of anti-smoking affairs. He first explained the increase in members of the League of Nations' Advisory Committee on Narcotics and the staff of the League of Nations Secretariat's Opium Problems Department since 1930, as well as its impact on international anti-drug work. He then analyzed the nature and main points of the 1931 Convention for Limiting the Manufacture of Narcotic Drugs, and pointed out, from legal and practical aspects, that the Convention was more progressive than the previous two Opium Conventions of 1912 and 1925. He then described the situation of the Bangkok Conference on Prohibiting Smoking the year before last, and the League of Nations' work on opium smoking and cultivation, and the problems that still need to be solved in practice. Finally, he expressed the hope that the Anti-Drug Association would continue its efforts and effectively liaise with international anti-smoking organizations in order</p>
<p>to achieve the goal of anti-drug. After the report, Chairman Wang Jingqi gave a thank-you speech. Then, Huang Jia-Hui, the association's director-general, reported on the association's affairs and the domestic opium situation. Yang Renlao, director-general of the Fujian Anti-Drug Branch, reported on the opium situation in Fujian, stating that after the administration of the 19th Route Army, no effort was spared in prohibiting smoking. The provincial government issued a detailed circular, strictly prohibiting the planting of opium seedlings in all districts of the province during the autumn of this year. All fields must be planted with grains, and violators will be severely punished. It is expected that the opium seedlings in Fujian Province will disappear this year. It was already 7:30 p.m., and the guests and hosts parted on good terms. It is reported that after this long discussion with the committee members of the Anti-Drug Association, Mr. Zheng had a very clear understanding of the domestic opium situation, and his impression of the association was also very deep. He will soon depart for Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Singapore to conduct a detailed investigation of the opium situation. When he returns to Europe, he also plans to vigorously promote the situation of the Anti-Drug Association internationally. It is heard that anti-drug organizations in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Singapore, and other places are actively preparing to welcome Mr. Zheng.</p>

I will never waste a single line or misuse a single person, and I will never engage in embezzlement or accept bribes. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment.

<p>Wen Yuqing, Director of the International Telegraph Bureau, said in his speech: "Ladies and gentlemen, today is the oath-taking ceremony for the chiefs, deputy chiefs, and assistants of the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific Sanshui Companies appointed by the Ministry of Communications. We all understand that the three companies have a long history in China and are very well-managed. Their past achievements in serving society are worth commemorating. However, in the past, all matters relating to receiving and dispatching telegrams were handled entirely by their respective companies. Regarding this point, I want to solemnly say that it is in conflict with our National Government's Outline of National Reconstruction, because the Outline of National Reconstruction states that all telecommunications and transportation undertakings should be managed by the state. Not only is it inconvenient for foreigners to overstep their authority, but Chinese people are also not allowed to operate them privately. This is a matter of the sovereignty of the entire country. That is why I want to emphasize this point in particular, and I hope that all of you chiefs, deputy chiefs, and all sectors, Chinese and foreign, will have a deeper understanding of this point. When the contracts of the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific Sanshui Companies expired at the end of 1930, the National Government, based on the principles of the Outline of National Reconstruction, decided to take back and manage the undertaking itself. After many discussions, it was recently agreed that the rights to receive and dispatch telegrams for each company should be returned to us first. As for all the past circumstances, you are all very clear, so I will not talk about them anymore. Now, we have decided to officially take over the rights to receive and dispatch telegrams for the three companies the day after tomorrow (May 1). Why do the chiefs, etc., have to have this oath-taking ceremony before taking office? My personal feeling is that it has two meanings: (1) Because the past achievements of each company have been very good, we must manage them even better after taking over, so as not to fail the government's trust and the expectations of all sectors; (2) The telecommunications business is a business that serves the public. We should embrace the spirit of serving human communication and seek happiness for society, and we must not be induced by money or coerced by power and lose our inherent vocation. These two points are my personal feelings about this oath-taking, and I offer them as a guide to all oath-takers."</p>

<p>Guo Shirong, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Telegraph Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, the oath supervisor, said in his admonition: "The Sanshui Telegraph Company has always been a matter of common concern to China and foreign countries, and it is extremely important for international communication and the evolution of civilization. After the recovery this time, I hope that my colleagues will be sure to fulfill their responsibilities, strive to improve, and strive to develop and promote it."</p>
<h3 id="e151">Chief's Reply <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Li Jiqing, Chief of Reception and Dispatch of the Pacific Sanshui Line, and Shi Tao Lai, Deputy Chief of Reception and Dispatch of the Great Eastern, gave replies successively. Li said, "Chinese international telecommunications has always relied on the reception and transmission of the Sanshui Telegraph Company. However, the right to receive and dispatch has always belonged to the three companies, and it cannot be denied that this hinders our national sovereignty. Therefore, in 1930, the Ministry of Communications, in view of this, decided to negotiate with the companies to recover it in order to respect sovereignty. Later, after dispatching personnel to contact them, the companies also believed that this should be the case, so the negotiations went very smoothly. Now it has been officially recovered. From now on, with Sino-foreign cooperation and joint efforts, we must further promote the development of international telecommunications." Deputy Chief Shi (Englishman) said, "We three are now recommended by the company and appointed by the Ministry of Communications, and we will continue to serve in the company's reception and dispatch office. We will naturally do our best to fulfill our duties and work together with all our colleagues to promote the development of international telecommunications."</p>

<p>Report from the Secretariat of the 4th Standing Committee Meeting of the Grand Alliance to Abolish Civil War. It has been found that the situation of the three months since the establishment of the association has been reported to the last standing committee meeting. Since the last meeting, four months have passed. During these four months, civil wars have gradually been eliminated, and the work of the association has also gradually shifted from tense to relaxed. However, we have continued to carry out propaganda and solicitation activities without daring to slacken in the slightest. The report is still submitted in separate articles as follows: (1) Mediation of civil wars: The Sichuan War was decided at the last standing committee meeting to appoint Lin Kanghou, Liu Zhanen, and Pu Yangshan as representatives to petition in Nanjing. The representatives set off for Nanjing on December 13 last year to petition the central government. The results were quite satisfactory, and the report has been published in the fourth volume of the Abolish War Series. I will not repeat it here. Soon, the two Liu regretted their actions, and the Sichuan War ended immediately. The change in Guizhou has been decided by the duty standing committee since the last standing committee meeting. On December 23, it invited Sichuan and Guizhou fellow villagers and resolved five measures, which have also been published in the fourth volume of the Abolish War Series. The Guizhou situation has now also been calmed down; (2) Propaganda of association affairs: In addition to the first and second volumes of the Abolish War Series that have been issued previously, the third and fourth volumes of the Abolish War Series have been published successively and sent to all members as propaganda materials. The duty standing committee also discussed and decided to hold an essay competition to abolish civil war in order to spread propaganda widely; (3) Statistics of members: As of this month, there are a total of 387 group members and 2,054 individual members; (4) Receipt and dispatch of documents: During these four months, due to the gradual elimination of civil wars, there were fewer documents. A total of 40 documents were received and 250 documents were sent in December, 26 documents were received and 21 documents were sent in January, 8 documents were received and 23 documents were sent in February, 3 documents were received and 16 documents were sent in March, and 16 documents were received and 62 documents were sent in April. A total of 88 documents were received and 372 documents were sent. The above four items are submitted for your review. Secretary-General Yan Ersheng.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Declaration <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>To all national organizations, groups, newspapers, and fellow compatriots: The barbaric invaders are increasingly aggressive, having already seized four provinces and now disturbing North China. As our country faces imminent demise, the only way to survive is through unity. Our association held its fourth standing committee meeting in Shanghai on the 29th of this month. After discussion by the attending committee members, it was unanimously agreed that the past internal conflicts have led to today's perilous situation. Therefore, the only way to seek a future path to survival is for the entire nation, from top to bottom, to be of one mind and one heart, to abandon selfish views, to jointly avert the crisis, to resist Japan with all our strength, and to establish domestic peace and construction. At this time and in this situation, there must not only be no more internal conflicts in reality, but also no more imagining of internal conflicts. Not only must there be no more imagining of internal conflicts, but also no more psychological barriers. Only by refraining from certain actions internally can we then take effective actions externally. If we unite our strength, we will succeed; harmony ensures victory. We offer this sincere declaration, hoping that you will consider and accept it. Sincerely, the Abolish Internal War Grand Alliance General Assembly.</p>

<p>The Railway Line Products Exhibition has been open for two weeks. The exhibition initially displayed nearly ten thousand items. However, since the opening, merchants from various places have continuously sent products, enthusiastically requesting the association to display them. The deadline for collecting exhibits was originally announced before the opening. The exhibition hall's layout was already dense, leaving no space for arrangement. However, to encourage merchants, the association has been making every effort to accommodate new arrivals. They are either adding them or selecting similar existing items for replacement, in order to demonstrate the intention of promoting them universally. The dedication of the association's work can be seen from this. It is said that the merchants are extremely pleased with this.</p>

<p>Over 600 Feet Long, Construction Continues</p>
<p>Capable of Repairing the 10,000-Ton President Steamer</p>
<p>Naval Minister Chen Shaokuan arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency met him at the shipyard. According to the discussion, the third dock is about to begin construction. The director of the Mawei Ship Repair Yard was summoned to Shanghai and instructed to handle shipbuilding and repair matters, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e160">Opening a Dock <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Previously, due to the shipyard's thriving business, the existing No. 1 and No. 2 docks were insufficient. The director personally opened a new dock last year at the West Fort, which is over 600 feet long and can be used to repair large ships, such as the 10,000-ton President steamer. Since the groundbreaking, progress has been hindered by the January 28th Incident, causing delays until now. It is now planned to resume construction in the near future, requiring approximately one million yuan. It is determined to open 300 feet first, so that it can be completed and put into use as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Building Customs Ships <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Our shipyard is currently contracted to build ten Hai Pi patrol boats. In order to complete them quickly, we have specially summoned Yuan Jin, the director of the Mawei Shipyard, to Shanghai to discuss the matter. The customs ships will be built by our shipyard, and the new ships will be built by the Mawei Shipyard. Director Yuan will return to Fujian in a day or two.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Chen and Li Return to Shanghai <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Commander Chen Jiliang previously led ships to the San Du naval exercise and has now arrived in Fuzhou. Since the exercise has concluded, Commander Chen will come to Shanghai in a few days. Several ships from the exercise will come to Shanghai for repairs. Vice Minister Li Shishen is currently inspecting at the Jiangnan Arsenal and will be able to return to Shanghai in about two weeks.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Tianjin Haijiao Incident <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Tianjin Haijiao Incident, it is reported that the French Concession has begun demolishing houses and opening roads. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now lodged a protest with the French Ambassador to China, demanding that the illegal conditions be canceled. It is expected that this matter will be resolved soon.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Xujiahui Merchants and Residents Oppose Stopping Dredging of the Pu Zhao River <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government divided the Puzhao River in western Shanghai into sections and invited workers to dredge it, work has now begun in order, and the Songqing section west of Jiepai Bridge will soon be completed. However, the eastern half of the sixth section (i.e., from Pailou Bay to Jinji Bridge) is now facing suspension due to the Municipal Government's tight budget and cost-saving measures. When the merchants and residents of the entire town of Xujiahui learned of this, they were all alarmed. They believe that the river surface of the sixth section is an important waterway for ships traveling between the town and Sijing, and is particularly important for shipping. Yesterday, they jointly submitted a petition to the Rehabilitation Association, the Municipal Government, and the River Dredging Committee, requesting that the dredging be carried out quickly according to the original plan.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Notes on Labor Disputes <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Hua Shun Rubber Factory</p>
<p>The Hua Shun Rubber Factory on Kang Nai Tuo Road employs more than 100 workers. The factory announced a temporary closure on the 9th of this month, and work has not yet resumed. Due to livelihood concerns, the workers petitioned the party and government agencies on the 24th. However, because no mediation has been convened, yesterday morning at 10:00, representatives Qiu Zemin, Shen Hongsheng, Ni Shunrong, Li Jingui, Cai Ajin, Min Jingen, and others went to the Social Affairs Bureau for a second petition, requesting an early resolution. The mediator Zhang Chuqiang received them and scheduled a meeting for both labor and management at the Social Affairs Bureau on May 1st at 9:00 AM for questioning and mediation.</p>
<p>First Foundry</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Foundry at the end of Kunming Road, Gao Lan Bridge, dismissed two workers on the 20th of this month, causing opposition from the majority of the workers. The workers in the molding department went on strike, demanding the reinstatement of the dismissed workers, which has not yet been resolved. Yesterday morning at 9:00, both labor and management were convened for questioning. Labor representatives Pu Zhixuan, Tang Lindao, Zhang Shenghou, Lu Shunhua, Wu A'er, Yu A'lai, and others arrived, but because the management did not arrive, it was impossible to proceed. Zhu Jintao, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, said that the workers' sudden strike due to the dismissal of workers was inappropriate and should be reported to the competent authorities. However, in order to avoid the expansion of the situation, it was rescheduled for both parties to be questioned at the bureau on May 1st at 9:00 AM. The notification has been issued.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Xielong Automatically Reduces Rent <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Due to the Poor Market Conditions</p>
<p>The depression in Shanghai's business community has reached its peak. In the British and French concessions, newly built municipal houses on various roads are vacant and closed, with no one to rent them. The reason is that the rents are too high, and no one inquires. In the Rong Sheng, Fan Zhi, and Geng Fu neighborhoods on North Jiangxi Road in the Public Concession, newly built municipal houses are managed by the Xielong property management firm. The original monthly rent was 98 yuan per building. Now, because only a few have been rented out, the landlord has automatically reduced the rent to 80 yuan per building, which will be implemented starting next month.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Huang Gu'en Discusses Aviation and Highway Construction Lottery <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has appointed Zheng Lai as the director of the Aviation and Highway Construction Lottery Office. A certain gentleman visited the office yesterday and was received by Secretary-General Huang Gu'en. The following is a record of his conversation: (Question) I understand the purpose of issuing the lottery from the name, but please provide more details about the measures. (Answer) The government believes that China has a vast territory and a large population, and transportation is very inconvenient. Therefore, it plans to issue this lottery four times a year, with a total value of 5 million yuan each time. Half of the money will be used as prize money for more than 50,000 numbers, 10% will be commission for the sales outlets, 5% will be for issuance and all necessary expenses, and the remaining 35% will be used to develop commercial aviation, such as purchasing airplanes, building airfields and repair shops, and establishing aviation schools. It will also be used to build highways and bridges to facilitate transportation throughout the country and develop agriculture and commerce in the interior. (Question) When will the first phase be issued and drawn, where will it be held, how will the huge amount of 5 million yuan be sold, and how will the prize money be distributed? (Answer) The first phase will be issued in early May, and the draw will be held in Shanghai on July 31st or earlier. The 5 million yuan will be divided into 500,000 lottery tickets, each selling for 10 yuan in Shanghai silver dollars. The office will select political and commercial institutions in various provinces of China, as well as overseas commercial institutions, to act as sales agents and promote sales as much as possible within three months. If there are any remaining tickets unsold at the end of the period, the Ministry of Finance will acknowledge them, regardless of the amount, until the actual amount reaches 5 million yuan. Therefore, the prize money will definitely be paid in full according to the amount. This is the sales method. As for the distribution of the prize money, it is as shown in this table. (When Mr. Huang spoke, he showed the prize money grade distribution table, which is now recorded as follows:</p>
<p>First Prize: 1 ticket, sole winner of 500,000 yuan, total 500,000 yuan</p>
<p>Second Prize: 2 tickets, 100,000 yuan each, total 200,000 yuan</p>
<p>Third Prize: 4 tickets, 50,000 yuan each, total 200,000 yuan</p>
<p>Fourth Prize: 10 tickets, 10,000 yuan each, total 100,000 yuan</p>
<p>Fifth Prize: 50 tickets, 2,000 yuan each, total 100,000 yuan</p>
<p>Sixth Prize: 100 tickets, 500 yuan each, total 50,000 yuan</p>
<p>Seventh Prize: 500 tickets, 200 yuan each, total 100,000 yuan</p>
<p>Last two digits of the first prize number match: 4,999 tickets, 70 yuan each, total 349,930 yuan</p>
<p>Last digit of the first prize number matches: 44,999 tickets, 20 yuan each, total 899,980 yuan</p>
<p>Total winning tickets: 50,665 tickets, total prize money: 2,499,910 yuan</p>
<p>(Question) The issuance of this lottery is handled by your office, but how will the draw be handled? (Answer) The issuance is the responsibility of the office. However, for the sake of seriousness, the National Government has specially established the Aviation and Highway Construction Lottery Committee to be responsible for supervision. Prominent figures from financial, commercial, and industrial circles in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, the Minister of Transportation, and representatives designated by the Supervisory Yuan, the Accounting Office, and the Ministry of Finance are invited to serve as committee members. However, all committee members are honorary positions only. Therefore, during the draw, the committee will send supervisory members, together with representatives from the Shanghai Local Court, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and the Bankers Association, to supervise the event in order to show seriousness and fairness. (Question) The committee is composed of Chinese and foreign figures, but can you show its powers? (Answer) The powers of the committee are very simple but extremely important, and can be divided into five items: (A) Approving the lottery issuance period and draw date; (B) Supervising the execution of affairs during the lottery draw; (C) Resolving all disputes arising from the lottery; (D) Safekeeping of the lottery proceeds, depositing them at any time in reputable Chinese and foreign banks, and allocating them to the government-designated construction funds; (E) Issuing various checks from the lottery proceeds. (Answer) After the draw, the matching number list is very important. How will it be certified by your office? (Answer) The matching number list will be issued by the office, but it must first be signed by the executive chairman and two members of the Lottery Committee, two notaries, and the office's Chinese accountant Huang Chengzhang and foreign accountant Xue Mailuo for certification. The gentleman excused himself and left due to the late hour.</p>

<p>Wu A'er Loyal to His Duties</p>
<p>Crushed to Death by a Machine</p>
<p>Wu A'er, a 22-year-old worker at the Shenxin No. 6 Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road, originally from Yancheng, was working in the waste cotton room at around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, the belt on the motor suddenly came off and fell to the ground, causing the machine to stop turning while the motor was still running. Upon seeing this, Wu immediately disregarded the danger and attempted to put the belt back on so that the machine could continue working. However, due to carelessness, his sleeve was caught by the belt, which crushed Wu's arm bone and caused severe injuries all over his body. He was bleeding profusely, a gruesome sight. His coworkers Meng Wu Bao and Tang Buyun noticed and immediately stopped the motor and tried to rescue Wu. However, it was too late. He was barely alive. They immediately reported to the factory staff, who reported to the Yangshupu Police Station, ordering detectives to investigate. After the investigation, Wu was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died shortly after. His body was taken to the Feilun Road Coroner's Office. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang Yaoguang was dispatched by the First Special District Local Court to examine the body. He ascended the stand to hear the case. According to Meng Wu Bao and Tang Buyun's testimony of the situation at the time, and according to the victim's mother, Wu Ji Shi, who reported the case, she demanded that the factory provide heavy compensation. The factory sent Zhang Haitang, a staff member of the general affairs department, who agreed to give her 200 yuan in compensation. However, she was still not satisfied and refused to sign the body collection form. Although Prosecutor Zhang explained the reasons with kind words, she did not listen. Mr. Zhang then ruled that the deceased Wu A'er had indeed died from being crushed by the machine wheel. The body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for temporary burial, pending collection.</p>

<p>Absolutely Not Redeemed with a Price</p>
<p>Since Mr. Sheng Xiegui, the Ningbo-born manager of the Yunfei Automobile Company's head office in Shanghai, was kidnapped the day before yesterday (the 27th) and escaped the next day (the 28th), the details of the entire process have been reported in this newspaper twice. However, after the news of Mr. Sheng's escape spread, there was much speculation in the outside world. Some said that Mr. Sheng escaped secretly, while others said that he was redeemed with a considerable price. The rumors were diverse and confusing. This reporter met with Mr. Sheng's close relatives yesterday, who said that Mr. Sheng's escape was definitely not redeemed with a price. The most important reason was that the police's pursuit was urgent, leaving no room for negotiation. Therefore, the bandits released him automatically the next day.</p>

<p>Stealing a Lot of Cash and Clothing</p>
<p>One Concubine Suddenly Regretted and Returned</p>
<p>Wu Xin, a 29-year-old Zhejiang native, runs a Samsung Flower Machine Factory at No. 13 Fuxing Lane, Beijing Road. Five years ago, he paid 600 yuan to take a Suzhou prostitute, Cheng Xiuzhen (now 22 years old), as a concubine. Three years ago, he spent 1,600 yuan to take a Hangzhou prostitute, Zhu Baobao (now 20 years old), as his third concubine. They all lived in the factory. Wu had a very harmonious relationship with the two women. The husband and two wives lived in peace. However, on the evening of the 26th of this month, Wu, who also served as a special patrolman, was ordered to go on duty. His bookkeeper, Mr. Shen, received 1,600 yuan in payments and went to hand it over to Wu Xin. Because Wu was not there, he gave it to Cheng to collect on his behalf, so that it could be handed over to Wu. Unexpectedly, Cheng, having obtained a large sum of money, discussed it with Zhu Baobao and suddenly had a bad idea. They stole valuables worth more than 2,000 yuan and fled without a trace. When Wu returned home and discovered what had happened, he reported it to the police and issued a warning. Later, Wu learned that the two women had a close relationship with Wang Jin, the madam of the Mingyue Shuju brothel at No. 3 Fuwu Lane, Guangxi Road. He went to investigate with a detective. When they arrived at the entrance of the brothel, they suddenly heard the voices of Cheng and Zhu talking. They immediately entered to search, but the two women had disappeared. When asked, the people in the brothel also said they did not know. At about 1:00 AM the day before yesterday, Cheng Xiuzhen suddenly returned home and was detained by Wu. When questioned in detail, she said that after escaping, they stayed at the Huizhong Hotel for one night. The next day, they went to Mingyue's place. Unexpectedly, Wu Xin also came to inquire at that time. They hid under the drying rack, so they were not caught. Later, they went to the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road and lived together in Room 361. Because she made a big mistake, she rashly returned home to atone for her sins. Except for the 200 yuan that was spent, all the stolen items were handed over to Zhu Baobao, who turned them over to her mother for safekeeping, and so on. Wu sent her to the police station, and the detective arrested Zhu Baobao. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Division of the First Special District Local Court. Judge Wu Xiangzu interrogated them. The police lawyer explained the situation and prosecuted them for embezzlement under Article 357 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Zhu Baobao denied handing over the stolen items to her mother for safekeeping. Judge Wu ordered the two defendants to be detained and rescheduled the trial because the case still needed investigation.</p>

The transportation costs of exhibits from China to Hamburg shall be borne by China, and the transportation costs from Hamburg to Berlin shall be borne by Germany. 2. China shall advance 3,000 marks as a subsidy preparation fund for use when the exhibition income is insufficient to cover expenses. At the same time, Germany shall also advance the same amount of subsidy preparation fund. 3. The exhibition items shall be insured for nine months, and the insurance shall not only be limited to Germany, so that they can still be exhibited in other countries after the exhibition in Germany. 4. The German side believes that it is best for all paintings to be rolled. 5. All exhibits must indicate the selling price, so that they can be purchased by admirers after the exhibition. When setting the price, it must be noted that one-tenth of the selling price must be sent to the owner of the exhibition venue (i.e., the Berlin Academy of Art) after the exhibit is sold.</p>

<p>As a Result of Mediation by the Shipping Association</p>
<p>There are seven merchant ships operating on the Shanghai-Qidong line, including Baofeng, Baohua, Xin Renhe, Guangxiang, Xin Shengda, Fuxing, and Haimen. Since the dissolution of the Public Bureau last autumn, they have been competing by lowering prices, and their businesses have suffered losses. In particular, those with larger hulls and better equipment have shown signs of financial strain due to their higher expenses. It is heard that the Tong, Ru, Chong, Hai, and Qilu Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association, recognizing that the price reductions by the ships may offer small advantages to passengers and merchants for the time being, predicts that in the future, the companies may be unable to maintain operations due to excessive losses and will be forced to suspend operations. The large ships will inevitably be affected. In the future, only ships with simple equipment and smaller tonnage will operate, and if passengers and goods are crowded and the load is too heavy, dangers will occur. The fellow townsmen of Chongming, Hai, and Qidong counties will bear the brunt of the impact. The lessons of Dalian are not far off. Therefore, they joined forces with the Shipping Association to mediate. After several discussions, there were some signs of progress. The association invited representatives from the governments and chambers of commerce of Chongming, Hai, and Qidong counties, and convened the persons in charge of each company, to hold a mediation meeting at the Shipping Club. Those present included Ding Hongguan (representative of Chongming County Government), Liu Fuchen (representative of Chongming County Chamber of Commerce), Chen Chi (representative of Haimen County Government), Xu Lisheng and Chen Huafu (representatives of Haimen County Chamber of Commerce), Yang Yongyan (representative of Qidong County Government), Gu Yueseng and Jiang Xiangyin (representatives of Qidong County Chamber of Commerce), Lu Caifu, Gu Nanqun, Mao Huiyu, Gu Shaowen (representatives of the Five Counties Fellow Townsmen Association), Chen Bogang (representative of the Shipping Association), and the managers' representatives of each company, totaling more than 20 people. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to establish a joint office for the Shanghai-Qidong shipping industry to unify passenger ticket prices and water freight rates. A board of directors and a board of supervisors will be established, and there will be specific decisions on equipment and treatment. Local government groups will implement supervision to achieve the goal of passenger safety.</p>

<p>Regarding the brick and ash industry in this city, Director Qu of the Shanghai County Tooth Tax Collection Office limited the brick and ash industry to receiving two permits, causing panic among merchants. They sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce to forward a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, ordering them to continue handling the matter according to the original plan. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has replied to the City Chamber of Commerce, approving the continued issuance of one permit according to the original plan.

He hoped that everyone would understand the importance of concentrating their strength. All the facilities in the association are the will of the members. Supporting the association is protecting oneself. He hoped that all members would develop close relationships and not treat each other like strangers. The future of the association will surely shine brightly.</p>

<p>The China Jiande Society, located at the intersection of Laobazi Road and Fusheng Road in this city, has experienced extraordinary development in its affairs since Mr. Wang Xiaolai took office as president, along with the constant efforts of executive director Chen Fukang, committee member Chen Zenglin, and general manager Wang Chengdian in planning. With the upcoming tenth solicitation period, the board of directors of the society decided to appoint Zheng Bin and Xu Duo as the director and deputy director of the solicitation committee, respectively. Preparations have been underway in recent days, and progress is quite smooth. In addition to President Wang serving as the commander-in-chief, Xu Shiying and Mayor Wu have been invited to serve as honorary commanders-in-chief, and Wen Hongen and Lu Jingshi as general staff officers. General Manager Wang Chengdian of the society has been running around to various places to make contacts, which has been quite successful. The society is the only group in Shanghai that advocates frugality and virtue, and its purpose is pure. It usually promotes public welfare and charitable causes with particular vigor and is trusted by people from all walks of life. The results of this solicitation are predicted to be excellent.

<p>Editorial Department ··· Training Institute ··· Manufacturing Department</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Datong Music Society in this city has compiled a history of Chinese music, manufactured a complete set of musical instruments, and trained an orchestra. Its national endeavors include the National Grand Music, the Zhonghe Shao Music, and the Chinese Military Music. Its artistic endeavors include the Neon Feather Dress Dance, Spring River Flower Moon Night, ensemble and solo performances on the qin, se, konghou, and pipa, as well as various elegant and popular silk and bamboo music. Recently, it has also produced sound films to participate in the Chicago World's Fair. The society believes that the first step of its work has been completed. Now, for the sake of the surrounding environment and to gradually approach Western music, without sufficient preparation, there is still a risk of failure. For this reason, the society has specially made a second step of progress. It is said that there are three prerequisites for its work: (1) Establish a national music editorial department to collect ancient great masterpieces and create new scores suitable for national music. (2) Expand the orchestra and national music normal school training institute. (3) Establish a musical instrument manufacturing department to standardize the national music law. In addition, the promotion of lyrics and melodies is also included, with a three-year completion period. Then, the third step of work will be carried out to combine Chinese and Western music into one furnace to complete the society's initial purpose.</p>

<p>During the board meeting of the Public Concession on April 26th, a director suggested that the large number of visitors to the parks under the Bureau's management made it difficult to manage, and it seemed appropriate to increase the price of annual tickets from one dollar to two dollars. Another director then suggested increasing the price of retail tickets by two cents each, without increasing the price of annual tickets. After consideration, it was decided to postpone the price increase because the term of the annual tickets was about to expire at the end of May, and the new tickets for the next term had already been printed and were inconvenient to change. However, the matter was handed over to the Works Committee for further consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e181">The Seriousness of the Leprosy Problem in the Yangtze River Basin <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Rotary Club of Shanghai recently invited Mr. Wu Zhijian, a Master's degree holder and the General Manager of the China Leprosy Relief Association, to give a lecture on leprosy in the Yangtze River basin. Mr. Wu said that according to expert statistics, there are three million lepers in the world, and China accounts for about one-third of them. This time, he was ordered to inspect Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Jiangbei, and he deeply felt that this disease is indeed a serious social problem in our country. The disease is particularly widespread in the central and southern counties of Hunan, likely because the area is adjacent to Guangdong, and the disease was probably introduced from that province. The northern part of the province has fewer cases. According to expert Mr. Fu Leren, leprosy in Hubei is concentrated on both sides of the Yangtze River and in areas with many lakes. There are also many lepers in Jiangxi, and the disease is spreading rapidly inland. Fortunately, Nanchang has our association's hospital, which helps to alleviate the suffering. Rugao, Dongtai, Yancheng, Qingjiangpu, and other places in northern Jiangsu can be called the center of leprosy. There are also many lepers in Shanghai, mostly from Jiangbei, concentrated in Zhabei, Yangshupu, Xujiahui, and Pudong. At present, our association plans to expand the existing Hongkou Dermatological Hospital to cope with the situation.</p>

<p>Two Transactions in the French Concession</p>
<p>Totaling Over Five Million Three Hundred Thousand</p>
<p>Real estate transactions have gradually become active since last month. This month, there have been more than ten transactions ranging from 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. This is because various places outside Shanghai are unstable, and many people are willing to invest in Shanghai. Large transactions have also followed. This week, there have been two transactions: one on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, covering more than five mu of land, with a selling price of more than 2.8 million yuan; and one in Jixiangli, Ningbo Road, covering more than nine mu of land, with a selling price of more than 2.5 million yuan. This trend will be similar to the prosperous era of 1920.</p>

<p>Tang Jiyao, a local resident, was employed at the Dayu Securities Firm established by Cai Xingjiu at No. 34 Avenue Edward VII. On the morning of September 29th of last year, at 9:00 AM, Tang was ordered by Cai to distribute government bonds and cash worth 32,880 yuan to various households. Unexpectedly, Tang had evil intentions and embezzled the government bonds and cash, fleeing without a trace. Cai reported the case to the police and requested an arrest. Until yesterday morning, Detective Ma Mouxiang of the General Inspectorate learned that Tang was hiding at No. 15 Biqiao Road, Caohejing. He immediately went to the Public Security Bureau at that location and, together with detectives, arrested Tang Jiyao at the address. He was then sent to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division No. 1. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the case still needed to be investigated and requested a postponement for investigation. Judge Feng Shide briefly questioned the defendant and ordered the case to be postponed for seven days for further questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Re-discussing "Can the Countryside Be Returned To?" by You Huaigao <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Before I discuss this issue, I have a few very sincere words to say to the readers. I strongly disapprove of using sarcastic and harsh language to attack anyone who submits articles. It is a waste of space and achieves nothing. This is not the original intention of the Shen Bao's establishment of the Reader Consultant section. Therefore, I will not only refrain from using retaliatory measures to attack those who have ridiculed and scolded my articles in the past ten days or so, but also advise readers, especially Mr. Liu Siming, to be prudent in discussing and publishing their opinions.</p>
<p>Please understand that the open discussion in the Reader Consultant section is like a round table conference. Shen Bao is the chairman, and we are all members attending the discussion on the question of "Can the Countryside Be Returned To?" We must focus on the question itself in order to reach a conclusion. This is what Mr. Xiongsheng hopes for, and it is also what the readers hope for. Otherwise, straying too far from the topic will make it impossible for everyone to discuss. We are guests invited by Shen Bao, and we should speak politely so as not to lose the demeanor of scholars. Shen Bao provides us with space, and we should make good use of the opportunity to express ourselves as much as possible, because I believe that the current rural problem is indeed a major problem in China, worthy of our careful and meticulous discussion. Therefore, I agree that readers should abandon minor details and focus on the big picture. In my opinion, there should be at least two observations on this issue: (1) How to solve the problem of personal life after returning to the countryside, as asked by Mr. Xiongsheng. (2) How to solve the entire rural problem of the country. The first question has already been answered to Mr. Xiongsheng on April 5th. As for the second question, please allow me to discuss and explain it further.</p>
<p>In the past ten days or so, I have read more than a dozen articles. Very few people agree with the idea of "Can the Countryside Be Returned To?" Some people believe that the countryside is full of imperialist aggression, bandits, warlords, local tyrants, exorbitant interest rates, and heavy taxes. It is almost impossible to live in the countryside for even a day. Unemployed people come to the city to make a living. The countryside is bankrupt. Therefore, if we want to return to the countryside, we must fundamentally transform this distorted social situation. So, unless imperialism is overthrown and capitalism is overturned, even if the countryside becomes as developed as the United States, it will only experience a widespread economic panic like the United States. What good is there in that? This is the argument advocated by people like Mr. Liu Siming and Mr. Zhu Ying. You must understand that China is vast in territory, and you cannot use the special situation of one place at one time to say that the whole country is like that. The poverty of farmers did not begin today. As for saying that all farmers are bankrupt, I am afraid that is an exaggeration. Imperialist aggression is naturally felt most acutely in the city, not in the countryside. Although there are bandits in the countryside, the kidnappers and thieves in the city are much more vicious. There is indeed oppression by local tyrants and bullies in the countryside, but the evil deeds and murders committed by the ruthless tycoons and unscrupulous merchants in the city are probably also much more vicious. The exorbitant interest rates in the countryside are not as bad as the high rents in the city. I do not believe that the heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies in the countryside are more numerous than the stamp duties, business taxes, import and export taxes, house taxes, vehicle taxes, and license taxes in the city. If you say that unemployed people in the countryside have all run to the city, that is not a fact. Even taking Shanghai as an example, it is less than one percent of the number of people in the whole country. I believe that people come to Shanghai to make a fortune, but I doubt that they come to Shanghai to make a living because they are unemployed. Therefore, I say that people who come to the city, except for laborers who do indeed come from the countryside, are only of two types: one is capitalists from the inland, and the other is gangsters from the inland. Both of them want to make a fortune more easily than in the inland. So, instead of saying that the intrusion of imperialism into the countryside has bankrupted the countryside, it is more reasonable to say that the scientificization of foreign agriculture has taken away the Chinese farmers' market, causing the Chinese countryside to go bankrupt and farmers to be impoverished. It is indeed terrible that imperialism uses the sharp weapons of science to secretly kill our compatriots. Look at American cotton, which is longer, better, more abundant, and cheaper than ours. Therefore, the yarn factories in our country buy American cotton instead of domestic cotton. American wheat is larger, whiter, more abundant, and cheaper than ours. Therefore, the flour mills in our country buy American wheat instead of domestic wheat. Siamese rice is better and cheaper than ours. Therefore, the grain merchants in our country buy Siamese rice instead of domestic rice to make up for the shortage. Chinese silk is not as good as Japanese silk. Therefore, the United States buys Japanese silk instead of Chinese silk. The tea market has been mostly taken away by Japan and India. Because Chinese merchants like to adulterate tung oil, the United States has already planted tung trees in the South. Therefore, if China does not fundamentally improve farmers' knowledge through rural education and seek major scientific reforms in agriculture and industry, no matter how hard Chinese farmers work and no matter how thrifty they are, they will never be able to compete with the scientifically advanced agriculture of foreign countries. They will only face failure and elimination day by day. I see through this danger, so I am shouting and advocating a theory of rural education to save the country (10,000 copies of the separate edition have been printed and distributed throughout the country. Please attach a one-cent stamp to send it to you). I do not oppose the government and soldiers' work of resisting Japan and defending the country, but I do not advocate mobilizing the whole country to go to the front line to resist Japan like Mr. Liu Siming. My opinion is that while we are bravely resisting Japan, the people should also do some grassroots work. This grassroots work is for the intellectual class to serve the countryside, to build it in education, agriculture, and social work, because we are at most millions of people. If we shout in the city, and if we leave these hundreds of millions of farmers alone to do the work of construction and resistance against Japan, our strength will be limited. Therefore, the purpose of my theory of rural education to save the country is this. Finally, in this month, I have received more than 100 letters from various places (including three letters from Jiangxi, all wanting to return to the countryside, which is enough to prove that the countryside cannot be returned to is not a fact). After reading them, I almost burst into tears, because the honest and sincere attitude, the patriotic zeal, the sincere desire for knowledge, and the simple desire for improvement in the letters are all enough to make me admire them immensely. I feel that there is hope for China's future. People of conscience should work even harder to save the country. I am very willing to spend a few hours every week, within the possible scope, to discuss with comrades who want to return to the countryside and to correspond with comrades who are already serving in the countryside. All letters will be answered one by one. I would also like to introduce several organizations that have already achieved considerable success in serving the Chinese countryside: one is the Rural Construction Research Institute in Zouping County, Shandong (sponsored by Mr. Liang Shuming), one is the Pingjiao Society in Ding County, Hebei (sponsored by Mr. Yan Yangchu), and the rural undertakings run by the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association in various counties of Hebei and by Jinling University in Wujiang have all achieved considerable success. If all provinces and counties in China can emulate and implement them, there will be hope for the future of the countryside (the discussion of this issue ends).</p>

<p>Two People on the Truck Side Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 11:00 AM, the head of the Lujinji Brick and Tile Company on Macgregor Road hired manual cart drivers to transport a large batch of bricks and tiles. Later, due to a disagreement on the price, they hired Huafu Truck Company to transport them. Just as the first truck was about to leave, and the second truck had not yet been fully loaded, dozens of cart drivers suddenly gathered and blocked the truck. Before a word was spoken, both sides started a brawl. As a result, two people on the truck side were injured, and one cart driver was injured. Huafu Company immediately reported to the Gordon Road police and requested protection. The head of the police specially sent several detectives to arrest them, but the cart drivers had already scattered. It is said that both sides have gone to the First Special District Court to examine their injuries and file a complaint.</p>

The two children were later claimed by their families, Wang Qiu-shi and Jin Qi-shi. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan, along with the Chief Prosecutor, came to Criminal Division No. 3 to continue the interrogation. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the previous situation and questioned Wang Jiang-shi and Huang Wei-shi. They confessed that Wang Laosi, who was on the run at the time, ordered them to watch over the two children on the ship and sell them to Fujian for a reward of ten yuan each. Lu Li-shi confessed that Wang Laosi also ordered her to escort the two children to Fujian. Wu Asi confessed that he had abducted the child Wang Koubao on Changan Road and handed him over to Wang Laosi, receiving two yuan. Huai Qicai confessed that he was an apprentice at Huang Kaiyuan's place, where Huang Wei-shi went, and that he knew nothing about the child abduction. He asked for leniency. Judge Wu then sentenced Wang Jiang-shi, Huang Wei-shi, and Lu Li-shi to three years in prison each, and Wu Asi to four years in prison. The number of days of detention before the final verdict was determined to be equivalent to one day of imprisonment for every two days of detention. Huai Qicai was acquitted.</p>

<p>Claimed to be Hit by a Stray Bullet During a Robbery</p>
<p>Found to be a Love Quarrel</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM a few days ago, a man wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants came to Renji Hospital for treatment. He had been shot in the left hand and left foot with a pistol bullet. He claimed that he had been hit by a stray bullet during a robbery near No. 9 Shushengli, Jiudia. The incident was learned by the Laozha police, who sent officers to investigate at the Second District Public Security Bureau. Shen Zhenhua, the head of the Second District First Sub-Bureau, stated that there was no robbery or shooting in Jiudia. Police officer Ma Yumin was also sent to the scene to investigate and found that there was no Shushengli in Jiudia. He then went to Renji Hospital and questioned the injured man again and again. The injured man finally said that his name was Wang Ahai and that he actually lived at No. 19 Shuxingli, opposite the Xiaobeimen in the French Concession. The gunshot wound he suffered was actually due to a love quarrel, and he was shot by an enemy. The injured man has now been taken to the hospital by Detective Zhou from the French police for interrogation, fearing that there may be hidden circumstances, so that they can thoroughly investigate. Police officer Ma has already reported back to the station.</p>

<p>Xiao Zhimei Conspires to Intimidate</p>
<p>Wang Akun Recognizes the Scheme</p>
<p>Wang Akun, 31 years old, from Shaoxing, makes a living by rowing a boat. A few days ago, he and his wife, Gao-shi, transported a large batch of radishes to Shanghai from their hometown. After selling them, they lodged in room 40 of the Dongfang Hotel in Xiaodongmen. At 11:00 PM the night before last, Wang went out for some business. Soon after, more than ten men, looking fierce, pushed open the door and entered. They asked Gao-shi, "Where did your husband go?" She replied that he had gone out for business and would be back soon. She asked them to wait a moment. The men then sat in the room and waited. Soon after, Wang returned and was immediately greeted by one of the men, who sternly said, "We are public security officers on official business. Where are you from? What are you doing here?" Wang saw that the man was wearing a dark blue serge Zhongshan suit and black glasses, looking very much like a government employee. His tone and manner were stern, so Wang replied that he was from Shaoxing and had come to Shanghai to sell goods. However, one of the men suddenly said, "No, no. They are definitely not good people. We should take them to the police station first and then decide what to do." After saying this, he pulled out a pair of handcuffs from his side and moved forward to handcuff Wang, pretending to do so. Wang then quickly clarified that they were indeed a legally married couple. Another man then came forward, pretending to mediate, and advised Wang to pay 20 yuan to settle the matter, and used various threatening words. At this point, Wang realized that the men had come here with the intention of extorting money, so he immediately refused. By this time, the incident had alarmed the people in the hotel, who came out to investigate. Fearing that something unexpected might happen, the hotel owner quickly went out and called the local patrol police. The men saw their opportunity and scattered and fled. Only one man, the one wearing the Zhongshan suit, was apprehended on the spot and taken back to the First District Second Sub-Bureau along with Wang Akun. During the preliminary hearing by Director Liu, Wang explained the situation and requested a thorough investigation. The man, when questioned, gave his name as Xiao Zhimei, 28 years old, from Fujian. He hesitated in his other answers. After investigation by the police, it was found that Xiao Zhimei was an unemployed petty thug who usually engaged in all kinds of illegal activities. This time, he had even dared to impersonate government employees to extort money from travelers, which was extremely unlawful. He was immediately ordered to prepare a written report and be sent to the bureau for questioning.</p>

<p>The coal boat of the Xinyi Gong Coal Company, located at the Nichengqiao on Suzhou Creek, hired Xin Arong's coal boat to transport 50 tons of coal the night before last. It was towed to the Datong Wharf in Nanshi to moor, waiting to be unloaded onto the Huaan steamship. Unexpectedly, at 1:30 AM, another large steamship moored at the wharf raised anchor and exited the port. Xin's boat was affected, and the mooring cable broke. At that time, the tide was rising rapidly, and the boat drifted southward. When it floated to the Dongjiadu area, it collided with the anchor chain of a motor fishing boat moored there and capsized. All the coal was submerged at the bottom of the river. Fortunately, there was no one on the boat, so no accident occurred. However, the fishing boat's anchor chain was broken, so the boat also drifted southward. Its stern collided with the bow of the Qing'an warship moored behind it, causing minor damage to the warship. The fishing boat itself was still intact. After the accident, all parties involved reported to the Customs Water Police for record-keeping.</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern, According to Zhu Hongru of the Da Xing Company, the news column of Shenbao on April 28 carried a news item about the First Special District Court strictly handling bribery cases, in which the Da Xing Company and Zhu Hongru were involved. The content of the news involved a lawsuit that was actually a matter of the Xie Long Company, and had nothing to do with the Da Xing Company. Da Xing had already transferred the property rights to Xie Long Company, and the Xie Long Company filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court in the name of the owner. There is a record of this. Later, because the lease contained the name of the former owner, Da Xing Company, Xie Long Company changed to using the name of Da Xing Company in the lawsuit in procedure, but in fact and in law, it had nothing to do with Da Xing Company. It has nothing to do with Zhu Hongru of Da Xing Company. Fortunately, it is recently heard that the court is investigating the case, and the facts will not be difficult to come to light in the future. I am afraid that the outside world does not know the truth, and that misinformation will hinder the reputation of Da Xing Company and Zhu Hongru. I have entrusted your lawyer to publish a statement in the newspaper and to write to Shen Xin Erbao to correct the news published on April 28. In light of the above, please make a factual correction. Sincerely, Jiang Jiemin, Lawyer, April 29.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Girls' B Team Championship Still Problematic <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>▲Wuben and Aiguo Still Need to Compete</p>
<p>▲Due to Unresolved High Jump</p>
<p>Wuben Holds Advantage, Aiguo Still Has Hope</p>
<p>According to the report of the chief referee, the team championship of the Girls' B group still has problems with the high jump event, which needs to be resolved at a later date, so it cannot be determined at present. However, it will definitely be one of Wuben and Aiguo schools. The scores already obtained by the two schools are: Wuben 24 points, Aiguo 23 points. The situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>Wuben: Wuben has Ji Shuren and Hua Shuzhen in the unresolved high jump. If they can get second and third place after re-jumping, or if one of them gets first place, then 24 plus 5 points equals 29, and Wuben wins the championship. If they get second and fourth place, and Zhang Minzhi of Aiguo gets first place, then the championship will be transferred to Aiguo.</p>
<p>Aiguo: Although Aiguo is currently behind Wuben by one point, if Zhang Minzhi of Aiguo can win first place in the re-jump, then Aiguo will win the championship. Aiguo still has hope, and it is hoped that they will work hard at that time.</p>

<p>▲Women's 100m: In the first event, the women's 100m final, after Xu Guangming from Wuben false-started twice and was disqualified, Xiao Jieying was very anxious and strived to win, which she did, winning by five yards. Her time was 15.4 seconds, earning five points for Wuben. The situation for the other three was quite even. The Group B competition was extremely fierce. Tan Shangzhen from Wuben won first place by only one step, but Miss Tan ran into the adjacent lane midway. Although the chief judge ruled it irrelevant, other schools have protested. This matter has not yet been resolved. Chen Wanqing from the Physical Education School won first place, which was not easy. Chen Rongming was very close, taking second place. Among the three groups, the Physical Education School had the best result at 14.9 seconds.</p>
<p>▲Men's 200m: Dong Yinchu from Guanghua won first place very easily, with a time of 25.1 seconds. This person has great potential and should be encouraged. Liu Jiaxian, Cheng Zhihong, and Li Songnian had a fierce battle. In Group B, after Wang Xiangcheng was disqualified, Wu Dasheng's championship from Guanghua was no longer in doubt, but the result was quite poor, at 27.4 seconds. In the Physical Education School group, Yang Fang from Jiangnan took first place with 25.3 seconds, with the remaining three places all going to Dongya.</p>

<p>▲Men's 800m: Group A had a wonderful performance, with the lead changing hands midway, making it hard to distinguish. After one lap, Wang Jinbang from Shanghai Middle School was still in fifth place, while Lu Fengqian from Nanyang took the lead, seeming to claim the top spot for himself. However, with just over a hundred meters remaining, Wang unleashed his speed, gaining ground step by step, and ultimately snatched the championship at the finish line, with a time of 2 minutes 20 seconds. In Group B, Liu Chongli from Guanghua completed the race in one go, leading by twenty meters, but at the finish line, he only beat Xie Hanquan from Nanyang by five meters, with a time of 2 minutes 18 seconds, which was better than Group A. In the Physical Education School group, Zhao Puzhao from Jiangnan lost his chance due to being out of form, while Li Yanxiang ran with ease and excellent technique, winning the championship with a time of 2 minutes 16 seconds, the best among the three groups.</p>
<p>▲High Hurdles: This event was the least interesting, with a real lack of talent.

<h3 id="e226">Wu Yan's "Little Brother" <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Someone asked: In Wu dialect, a child is called "Little Gan," how should the character "Gan" be interpreted? I said: "Little Gan" is "Little Brother." "Ge" and "Gan" are transformations of the same sound, easily misread. Here's proof: Wu people call "one" "Yi Gan Zi". Therefore, calling "Little Brother" "Little Gan" is a similar proportional expression, nothing unusual. Someone asked: "Little Gan" is "Little Brother," that's true, but sometimes Wu people call a child "Little Gan Wu," how should this "Wu" be interpreted? I said: "Little Gan Wu" is "Little Brother Er". The "Er" sound is very common in Hangzhou dialect. Wu people are not used to retroflex sounds, so when saying "Little Brother Er," the "Ge" is read as "Gan," and the "Er" at the end of the word is read as the nasal "Wu". -- "Wu" as in the final sound of the English letter N.</p>
<p>Someone asked: In Wu dialect, the "Er" sound is often read as "Ni," like "Er Zi" (son) read as "Ni Zi." Following this logic, "Little Brother Er" should be read as "Xiao Ni Gan," not "Xiao Gan Wu." I said: Wu people have two ways of reading the "Er" sound. When "Er" means "son," it's read as "Wu." When "Er" is at the end of a word and has no meaning, then the "Er" is not read as "Wu," but as the nasal "Wu."</p>
<p>Someone asked: Do you have any evidence to prove that the "Er" at the end of a word is always read as "Wu" by Wu people? I said: Of course, but there aren't many examples. Why? Because Wu people often prefer using "Zi" rather than "Er" at the end of a word. For example, "Mao Er" (hat), "Xie Er" (shoe), "Bei Er" (cup), "Pen Er" (basin), Wu people simply say "Mao Zi," "Xie Zi," "Bei Zi," "Pen Zi," avoiding the retroflex "Er" sound. However, sometimes it's unavoidable, so they have to read "Er" as "Wu." Here are three examples: Wu people call "Ao Er" (padded jacket) "Ao Wu," "Kuai Er" (chopsticks) "Kuai Wu," and "Tao Qu Er" (seeking fun) "Tao Qu Wu." Therefore, Wu people calling "Little Brother Er" "Little Gan Wu" is a similar proportional expression, nothing unusual.</p>
<p>Since we know "Little Gan" is "Little Brother Er," then "Little Wu" is "Little Girl Er," which can be inferred and doesn't need further explanation.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Messages That Cannot Be Disclosed <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenxiang</p>
<p>丨Like the Spring Scenery Filling the Garden, Impossible to Confine丨</p>
<p>People generally believe that newspaper reporters are the least able to keep secrets. Therefore, when there is any secret message, they are deeply afraid of being known by newspaper reporters. Within the realm of possibility, they always try to hide it from the eyes and ears of reporters. If it is impossible to do so, and the facts cannot be hidden, they will not hesitate to use threats and inducements, or gentle requests, bringing out the final means to achieve the goal of not disclosing it in the newspaper. In fact, "If you don't want people to know, don't do it yourself"; this is an unbreakable truth. Although it is possible to prevent these newspapers in this place from publishing it, it cannot be guaranteed in another place. There are other newspapers that recklessly publicize it arbitrarily! Look at the news that Chinese newspapers cannot disclose; isn't it often specially published in foreign newspapers? The more people want to keep something secret, the more it arouses the curiosity of others and promotes people's attention. After all, it cannot be hidden or concealed. This is just like "Spring is filling the garden, impossible to confine, a branch of red apricot extends beyond the wall", the same principle.</p>
<p>Unless the red apricot has never been exposed to the spring breeze, if it has already experienced the spring breeze, and still hopes to maintain its old state, without change, without attracting attention, then it is simply an unreasonable dream! Even if you can find a way to raise the garden wall, not allowing any branches to develop outside the wall, and not allowing the slightest leakage of spring light; however, the spring breeze that cannot be confined still has the "skill of stealing fragrance." Who can stop the spring breeze from having a relationship with the red apricot? Who can deny that the fragrance of flowers cannot be brought out of the garden by the spring breeze?</p>
<p>In the past, it seems that an important person said, "Our good deeds are often hindered, and most of the spring scenery is leaked by newspaper reporters!" According to the speaker's opinion, reporters have become one of the contemporary devils, wishing they could be wiped out in one fell swoop to have the hope of "completing" the so-called "good deeds." In fact, who is the devil? Who is not the devil? If the devil himself has never looked at his face in the mirror, how can he distinguish clearly? If you want the red apricot not to be seen by people outside the wall, then unless the red apricot itself does not secretly embrace the spring breeze! As the saying goes, "Good deeds don't hide from people, hiding them means they are not good deeds." The relationship between the red apricot and the spring breeze has already become an open secret, so there is no need to cover it up again. If the red apricot itself has a need to fear people, then the real devil, we can boldly say, is not someone else, but the red apricot itself!</p>
<h3 id="e228">The Slogan of National Extinction <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Huan</p>
<p>In recent years, the most fashionable slogan in Shanghai, which can be heard everywhere, is "Don't</p>
<p>take it to heart." For example, the sacred laborers say, "Don't take work to heart," the shop clerks say, "Don't take business to heart," the students in schools say, "Don't take schoolwork to heart." Our people, regarding their due obligations, everything, everyone shouts "Don't take it to heart." However, recalling since "September 18th," our government has repeatedly announced to us "long-term resistance," but our army retreated without a fight. Witnessing the beautiful rivers and mountains being taken away by the enemy, with Peiping and Tientsin in imminent danger of not being protected, and the exorbitant taxes and levies</p>
<p>, the money extracted from us is used to feed them, to ensure that they are conscienceless and mad, willing to abandon the tens of millions of miles of resource-rich "Northeast"? I think they are probably also shouting there, "If the Guanwai is lost, don't take it to heart." In the future, "If the Yellow River is lost, still don't take it to heart." Even if the Yangtze River and the Pearl River basins are all lost, everyone will still shout, "Don't take it to heart." Alas! "Even if we become slaves to a conquered nation, don't take it to heart!"</p>

<p>— Li Houying</p>
<p>It was a rainy day, and there were fewer pedestrians on the road; however, the sidewalks on both sides seemed even more</p>
<p>crowded.</p>
<p>At the corner of the road, at the entrance of a small alley, many people were gathered in a circle, watching the excitement.</p>
<p>This was a place where the rain did not fall, so there were even more people: breaking them down, most were idle people, and a small part were people with unimportant business; I was one of them.</p>
<p>The circle of people on the outside was very large, but the area inside was very small: there was only an empty space of about six or seven feet in diameter, and the protagonists were two children.</p>
<p>A two- or three-foot-long, very dirty cloth was spread on this open space; it was covered with two bowls; there were also three red cloth knots.</p>
<p>The two children were sitting behind this cloth. An older child, about eight or nine years old, cleverly moved the red cloth knots around under the bowls; the other one, even younger, only about seven years old, was also holding a gong, hitting it "Dang dang dang."</p>
<p>The sound of the gong attracted people walking outside; the small magic trick with the three red cloth knots was able to temporarily attract the viewers. Although they were young, they already understood the spirit of cooperation.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the gong stopped, and the magic trick was over; the younger one walked out two steps, and tumbled continuously in the open space. Although it was said to be spring; the weather was still very cold, and they were only wearing a very thin cloth shirt, and the shorts below were also short enough to be above the knees.</p>
<p>After a while, the older one also came out. The two of them hugged each other, connecting with each other and tumbling. Several of the viewers praised, saying, "It's really not easy to earn a few pennies, look how hard they are working!"</p>
<p>After another while, the younger one curled up into a ball, and the older one stood on his stomach. Several of the old customers who watched the free show had already quietly slipped away</p>
<p>good luck; by the time the older child opened his mouth to ask for money, there were only a few people left!</p>
<p>Several people threw down a few coins and left, but I was still standing on the side; suddenly, a police officer came over and drove them away fiercely.</p>
<p>The drizzle had stopped, and the sky was much brighter than before. I wandered along the road, feeling somewhat lost; a kind of lonely and cool gong sound still vaguely lingered in my heart.</p>

<p>Chapter Five: Brewing Tea to Pass the Long Night, Sorrowfully Remembering the End of the Year; Raising the Banner of Resistance, Shouts Resound High</p>
<p>Just like that, it stirred up Jiang's worries. She brewed another pot of tea and sat by the stove, slowly pondering the mixed feelings. She didn't know how long she had been sitting quietly. The girl was already asleep. She thought for a long time and then looked at the girl lying on the kang. She thought that talents like Company Commander Zhao couldn't be considered bad. She didn't understand what her girl meant. She didn't want to marry this relative. Before, it could be said that because of Gan Er Ye, she didn't want anyone else. Now he and Gan Er Ye have broken up, so why is she still unwilling to marry Company Commander Zhao? Jiang quietly thought for half the night but couldn't come to a conclusion. But her appreciation for Company Commander Zhao deepened because of this. On the next day, New Year's Day, she paid even more attention to whether Zhao Ziqiang had returned. But she waited all day without seeing his shadow. On the second day, before she got up, she heard him shouting outside the window: "Has Old Lady Yang gotten up? I'm here to wish you a happy New Year." Jiang smiled and said repeatedly: "I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare. I'll come to wish you a happy New Year in a moment." So Zhao Ziqiang left. Jiang, receiving this New Year's greeting from him, didn't know where her happiness came from. She immediately put on her clothes, got off the kang, quickly washed her face, combed her hair, and followed him to the inner courtyard. She saw two people in military uniforms sitting in Zhao Weng's house. Although Jiang recognized Zhao Ziqiang, she was always a little afraid of soldiers, so she stood at the door, taking two steps back. Zhao Ziqiang rushed forward and introduced: "This is Company Commander Yin, this is Company Commander Tian, they are all my sworn brothers." The two company commanders stood up and saluted. Jiang saw that they had guests and didn't want to stay long. She stood there, said a New Year's greeting to Zhao Weng, and left. Company Commander Yin, named Deren, smiled and said: "No wonder Ziqiang said this old lady is kind. Look at her face, it's full of kindness." Company Commander Tian, named Qing, was a young man in his early twenties. His military uniform was exceptionally neat, without a single wrinkle. A pair of leggings was tightly wrapped around his legs, as if glued to his calves. A pair of yellow leather shoes didn't have a speck of dust. Just looking at the fountain pen inserted in his military uniform pocket, he showed the civilization of a military man in his attire. (57)</p>

<p>A duck's feathers are always dry and don't get</p>
<p>wet. Why is that? Because near the duck's buttocks, there is a gland that secretes oil. Ducks often use their beaks to smear this oil on their bodies, so when ducks swim in the water, they won't get wet, and when they come out of the water, they always shake their bodies to brush the water off their feathers very cleanly.</p>

<p>Paper contains a lot of hydrogen and carbon. Celluloid, used for making toys, is a mixture of nitrated cotton and camphor. Since its invention by the American Hayswood in 1865, it has been used to make decorations, daily necessities, toys, photographic plates, etc. Simply put, it's like adding nitric acid to paper. Therefore, the toys we play with will catch fire when exposed to the sun's high heat.</p>

<p>There is a freshwater fish called the Archerfish in East India, also known as the water jet fish. It is about twenty inches long and often hides by the water's edge, waiting for insects. If insects fly and gather on the grass by the water's edge, it slowly raises its head above the water, opens its mouth, and blows out a stream of water, forcefully shooting at the insect's body. When the insect is hit, it falls onto the water's surface, where the fish can swallow it.</p>

<p>This year is You, You matches the chicken. Therefore, I will make various interesting chicken toys for you to see. The method is very simple. Not only can elementary school students make them, but even younger siblings in kindergarten can also make them. (1) Taro Chicken: Let's get two raw taro, one large and one small. The large one is the chicken body, the small one is the chicken head. Then use matchsticks or wire to connect the head and body. Cut two slices of carrot for the chicken feet to serve as a stand. The chicken's beak and claws are made of carrot flesh. The chicken's eyes are made of nandina seeds or the head of a matchstick. If you look at the picture, you will understand clearly. (2) Flannel Chicken: This chicken is made of scraps of flannel. First, cut out two pieces of white flannel of the same size. Use a pencil to draw the chicken body according to the pattern and cut it out. Then sew a dashed line around the edge (leaving a part of the abdomen unsewn). Sew along the dashed line with a needle. Turn it out from the unsewn area of the abdomen. Fill the inside with cotton. Then use wire to make two feet and insert them into the abdomen. Sew the abdomen closed with thread. Then cut out red flannel to make the chicken's comb and tail. Glue them on with glue, or sew them on with thread (two layers thick). Wrap the wire for the feet with brown wool yarn. The chicken's beak can be painted yellow. The chicken's eyes can be small, round, bean-like buttons, or they can be painted.</p>

<h3 id="e236">Further Discussion on "Returning to the Countryside" <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Cao Juren's argument "advocating returning to the countryside," I agree with Mr. Yang Xingzhi's rebuttal. Now I'll say a few more words.</p>
<p>I find it very strange that Mr. Cao divides the Chinese countryside into three types. Mr. Yang has already pointed out that Mr. Cao also errs in "forcibly dividing the entire capitalist world, the entire colonies, and the entire countryside in a state of collapse into two unconnected regions that seem to be independent: : :" However, I think even if we take a step back and examine Mr. Cao's statement out of context, it is still incomprehensible.</p>
<p>First, Mr. Cao said that the areas around Henan and Shaanxi have long become "villages without agriculture." I don't know if the word "agriculture" here refers to "farmers" or "agricultural affairs?" According to Mr. Cao's statement that "the county magistrate orders the planting of tobacco, and those who cannot pay the tobacco tax are beaten on the buttocks," then what he calls "without agriculture" is actually that farmers cannot grow crops, not that there are no farmers. And Mr. Cao then concludes: "Of course, there is no way to return to such villages without agriculture." This is to say: since you cannot farm, what's the point of going back! But doesn't Mr. Cao also advocate going to Type C villages to "organize self-cultivating farmers to fight a self-defense war"? Since you can go to Type C villages to fight a "self-defense war," why is there "of course no way to return" to the so-called "villages without agriculture" of Type A? Are the farmers in Henan and Shaanxi who have land but cannot grow rice truly doomed to die?</p>
<p>Second, Mr. Cao believes that in the areas around Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Anhui, capitalism eats the large landlords, and the large landlords eat the tenant farmers. There is "no way to return to this kind of countryside that is on the verge of collapse." Here, Mr. Cao's phrase "countryside on the verge of collapse" is again very ambiguous. If we say that the "rural economy" is on the verge of collapse, then the result of "capitalism eating the large landlords, and the large landlords eating the tenant farmers" is not necessarily the collapse of the "rural economy," but rather the transformation of self-cultivating farmers into serfs. Mr. Cao's meaning may lie in this, so he consistently uses the same perspective for dealing with Type A villages to deal with this Type B village: "there is no way to return either!"</p>
<p>Therefore, he believes that only Type C villages are worth or "have a way" to return to. Because they are centered on self-cultivating farmers, and "they can win even without fighting." However, what a "Utopian" theory this is! However, at the same time, we can also know that Mr. Cao feels that there is "no way to return" to Type A and Type B villages because there are no self-cultivating farmers in those two types of villages, and the power of the gentry and ruffians is very strong. To regard self-cultivating farmers as the basic force in the countryside to resist evil forces is also a misidentification on Mr. Cao's part.</p>
<p>Originally, the short article I published last time only posed negative questions about the calls for "returning to the countryside" in the film City Lights and other three works. I am not advocating not returning to the countryside. As for what to do when returning to the countryside, it's a long story. I can only avoid discussing it today.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Go Back to the Countryside and Do This! <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>丨Reply to Mr. Yang Xingzhi丨</p>
<p>The current clamorous issue of returning to the countryside does indeed have a strong Utopian flavor. My advocacy for returning to the countryside is not the same as those who dream of utopia. I myself am a small farmer. I only want to awaken the youth who come from the countryside to return to the countryside. What I said in the previous article only proves that there are still villages to return to, not that everyone must return to the countryside.</p>
<p>In the eyes of us small farmers, nine out of ten of those who loudly shout about returning to the countryside don't dare to "trouble" themselves. What will they do when they go to our villages? Can they feed cattle? Can they cut grass? If they can't even lead cattle or cut grass, what will they do in the countryside? If they say they're going back to be gentlemen, then please stay in Shanghai and "play mahjong," "act wildly with beautiful women," and fill in liberation lyrics! To be honest, none of the young people who have received a university education in Shanghai are qualified to return to the countryside! In the ninth year of the Republic of China, a wave of utopian work-study mutual aid groups arose in Beijing. Tianjin, Jinan, Shanghai, and Hangzhou followed with this kind of organization. Soon, this beautiful soap bubble burst, and nothing was left! If you are tired of urban life and want to go to the countryside to live a idyllic life, then its comical absurdity will of course be the same as that of the work-study mutual aid groups.</p>
<p>However, it is imperative that we return to the countryside, and it is a matter of current importance. The mouth of capitalism is just about to open and swallow up the self-cultivating farmers (please refer to the letter of weeping complaint from more than a thousand tenant farmers of the Yuhua Reclamation Company in Dongtai County to party and government agencies and organizations in Shen Bao on April 27). We urgently need to awaken the self-cultivating farmers and reject their investment. We will organize production and consumption cooperatives, improve agricultural tools, seeds, and promote agricultural products for self-cultivating farmers. Further, we will popularize farmer education, strengthen farmer organizations, and participate in the foundational work of the new society. There are at least tens of millions of self-cultivating households in China. This is not a negligible number, nor is it a negligible force. That is why I say that we will not be too disappointed when we return to the countryside.</p>
<p>However, young people who return to the countryside must possess three qualifications: A, be from a farming background, without the ambition to become a small or large landlord; B, be familiar with new agricultural tool technology and be able to work in the fields with self-cultivating farmers; C, be committed to lifelong service, without any thoughts of seizing power. Most importantly, they must have a strong organization (individuals have no power).</p>
<p>Throughout Chinese history, social movements have only been superficial movements based on slogans, never reaching the people. Can a house on the sand withstand a storm? What I hope for now is that everyone will do the opposite, not rushing for quick results, but burying their heads and focusing on underground movements, and see what our results will be in ten or twenty years. I call this kind of work the "tree planting movement" - 丨a movement that only plants trees for future generations, not wanting to enjoy the shade themselves.</p>
<p>Editor's note: The issue of "returning to the countryside" has been discussed for a long time in this newspaper's Readers' Advisory Column and has not yet ended. After publishing the articles by Mr. Xuan and Mr. Yang the other day, this attracted Mr. Cao's defense. In recent days, we have received many submissions regarding this issue, which has greatly expanded the battle lines. However, this publication has limited space, and it is really inconvenient to publish too much discussion on specialized issues. We are publishing the articles by Mr. Xuan and Mr. Cao, who represent the two sides' opinions, as a conclusion to this.</p>

<p>— En Ping</p>
<p>In the spring, the weather is clear and bright one moment, and then rainy and windy the next, truly the most unpredictable time of year in terms of cold and heat. It was in this kind of capricious weather that the lively and lovely Jieping died at a young age. By May 12th of this year, it will be a full year since Ping'er and I parted forever. She was only two years, two months, and twenty days old when she died, but in this short life, she heard the gunfire of the Sino-Japanese War, saw enemy bombers flying in formation and attacking, and saw the blazing light that burned incessantly day and night in Zhabei. She once followed her mother on an inland river steamer on the Suzhou Creek to avoid the war and return to her hometown, and she also followed her mother on a Yangtze River steamer back to Shanghai. She fell ill three days after returning to Shanghai. I remember on the day of "September 5th Memorial" last year, the signing of the Shanghai Armistice Agreement, it was as hot and cold as this spring. At that time, although her illness had improved, she had not fully recovered her health. Therefore, she caught a cold due to a sudden cold snap one night, and her fragile little body started to have chills and fever again. The illness became more and more serious day by day. After being sent to Guangren Hospital, she changed from chronic pneumonia to acute pneumonia and died after being hospitalized for only three days. This was the first time I felt the horror of death, the cruelty of death! The indescribable pain she endured on the sickbed during those three days is deeply imprinted in my heart and will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>Since Ping'er's death, I have felt the loneliness and solitude of life that cannot be filled. People who have lived in the city of Shanghai for a long time do not easily hear the cuckoo's call, and even if they do hear it occasionally, it is not easy to arouse special feelings. I don't know why, but since Ping'er's death, I have always heard the faint, fluttering cuckoo crying sharply and tragically in the sky. From late spring to early autumn, I heard the cry of "kugu, kugu" almost every day, hearing it on sunny days and hearing it on rainy days. Therefore, I fantasized that this might be Ping'er's spirit, a spirit that had lost its reliance. Sometimes I would go to the balcony, concentrate and listen, following the sound, and stretch my neck to look. Sometimes it sounded as if it were not far away, as if it were on the lush branches in the neighbor's garden; sometimes it seemed very far away, as if it were in the clear blue sky. I recalled my childhood when I lived in the countryside with my grandmother. My eighth younger brother died when he was two or three years old. In a dream, I suddenly saw the small coffin being carried to the ancestral tomb in the countryside for burial. At that time, I also heard the cry of "brother is going home," "brother is going home." I never thought that I would hear the tragic cry of the cuckoo in Shanghai that I had heard in the countryside twenty years ago!</p>
<h3 id="e239">Galsworthy's Literary Harvest <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Kagawa</p>
<p>Among world-renowned literary figures who live by their pens, it is said that George Bernard Shaw, who visited China not long ago, has the highest income. But if we investigate the late British literary veteran John Galsworthy, we find that his literary harvest is also quite impressive. According to recently released figures, from the age of forty-five or forty-six to sixty-six, over a period of twenty years, his annual income from royalties on novels and plays, as well as performance fees, totaled between £15,000 and £20,000. Adding to this the fees for short essays and articles contributed to newspapers and magazines in England and America, the total was actually as much as £50,000. Combined with the aforementioned royalties, the total annual income was approximately £70,000. If we take each pound as equivalent to 20 Shanghai circulating dollars, that would be 1.4 million dollars!</p>
<p>Since his income after achieving fame was so high, his work that brought him fame must have sold very well. Consider his representative work, "The Forsyte Saga," the first part of which, "The Man of Property," was published in 1906. In England alone, it quickly sold 100,000 copies. At that time, the author's royalty was 7%, so from this one book alone, he received £7,000 in royalties. As for the entire "Forsyte Saga," it sold 250,000 copies in England, and a total of 500,000 copies in the United States, Germany, and Scandinavia. The income from this is naturally imaginable.</p>
<p>When he reached the age of sixty, he was still energetic and continued to bury himself in writing. I will translate a few words he wrote on his sixty-second birthday here as a conclusion: "The reason I seem younger than those old men is because I practice riding, playing tennis, playing golf, and other sports every day. My creed is health first. My habit of doing things recently is to write novels in the morning, write plays in the afternoon, and absolutely not write in the evening."</p>
<h3 id="e240">Carrot Top <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Jules Renard, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Hoe</p>
<p>Big brother Felix and Carrot Top were working side by side. Each person held a hoe. Big brother Felix's hoe was made of iron by the blacksmith according to measurements. Carrot Top's was made of wood by himself. They were engaged in gardening, working quickly, showing enthusiasm. Suddenly, when Carrot Top was completely off guard (all misfortunes always befall at this time), he was struck on the forehead by a hoe.</p>
<p>A moment later, everyone carried big brother Felix inside, carefully placing him on the bed, because he fainted after seeing his little brother bleed. The whole family gathered there, walking on tiptoes, sighing, and worrying.</p>
<p>"Where is the salt?"</p>
<p>"Please bring some cold water to wet his temples."</p>
<p>Carrot Top climbed onto a chair, peering over the shoulders of others in the crowd. His forehead was wrapped in a cloth, which had already turned red, blood soaking into the cloth and spreading out.</p>
<p>Lepic said to him:</p>
<p>"You got what you deserved!"</p>
<p>His sister Ernestine, who was bandaging his wound, continued:</p>
<p>"It's really like digging in butter."</p>
<p>He didn't cry out, because based on experience, he knew that crying out was useless.</p>
<p>But at this moment, big brother Felix opened one eye, then opened the other. He was no longer afraid, and his face gradually returned to normal, so everyone was relieved.</p>
<p>"It's always like this!" Lepic's family said to Carrot Top: "Can't you be more careful, you idiot!"</p>
<p>Shotgun</p>
<p>Lepic said to his two sons:</p>
<p>"One shotgun is enough for both of you. Loving brothers can share everything."</p>
<p>"That's right, Dad," big brother Felix replied, "We can share one shotgun. And it's enough as long as Carrot Top sometimes lends it to me."</p>
<p>Carrot Top neither said yes nor no, he knew it was unreliable.</p>
<p>Lepic pulled the shotgun out of the green gun case and asked:</p>
<p>"Which of you two should take it first? It seems that the older one should take it first."</p>
<p>"I'm willing to give this honor to Carrot Top. Let him take it first!" big brother Felix said.</p>
<p>"Felix, your behavior today is very polite, I won't forget this," Lepic said.</p>
<p>Lepic then placed the shotgun on Carrot Top's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Go on, you can play well, don't quarrel."</p>
<p>"Shouldn't we bring the dog?" Carrot Top asked.</p>
<p>"No need. You can take turns being the dog yourselves. And, hunters like you won't wound, you'll only kill."</p>

<h3 id="e241">Finance: US Senate Passes Inflation Bill <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Causing a Rush for $16.50 Silver</p>
<p>Speculative Interest Wanes, Limited Scope for Rise</p>
<p>The fall in the silver market yesterday was mainly due to the US Senate passing the entire inflation amendment. Selling activity ensued. Initial telegrams from abroad reported that London's spot silver price decreased by 1.875, and the forward price by 25. New York silver prices decreased by a small 0.75, and US cotton also fell by 9 points. However, the forward silver price on the metal exchange rose by 0.5 to 1 penny. Private telegrams increased by 0.0625, and British-US exchange rates increased by 1/4 of 1.25. US-UK exchange rates also rose by 7/21. The opening price for raw silver futures showed a slight decrease, at 47.8 yuan, because the foreign telegrams had not yet arrived. When Reuters reported that the inflation bill had been completely passed, specifying the news from Washington at 7 o'clock (the exchange had already closed, so there was no sign of silver prices rising), people panicked. Hengyu, Ruixing, Fuchang, Hengxing, Qingfa, Yongbingxing, Yuanmao Yong (on behalf of Bingxing) all sold silver bars, and the opening price immediately dropped to 936.5 yuan. The foreign exchange market was flat for British currency and loose for US currency, with little trading. The silver market was also very quiet, with little fluctuation. Reuters telegrams received near noon transmitted the entire inflation amendment, including the provision allowing debtor nations to use silver to repay war debts (up to US$200 million), reducing the gold content by 50%, and allowing free coinage of silver. These provisions were unfavorable to the gold market. The closing price retreated to 933.5 yuan. The spot price premium was increased to 37 yuan, and the swap spread for May and June was 26 yuan. Here is a record of the morning market conditions:</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 936.5 yuan, a decrease of 13.5 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 37 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened with the spot price of British currency at 1 shilling and 3 pence and 25, the same as the previous close. The US currency opened at 24 yuan, then reached 6 yuan. Wanxingjin entered the market, rising to 9 yuan. Banks were willing to offer 75 for August US currency, Zhaofengchang and others sold a small amount. Mitsui sold 625 for July US currency, Hengyu continuously sold aggressively, reaching 4 yuan. Shanghai bought 375 for June US currency, returning to 1 yuan. However, because Hengyu continued to sell, and Ruikang also sold, it dropped to 2.5 yuan. Pangen bought 875 for August US currency, Zhaofengchang bought bars at low prices, Fuchang also worked hard to buy continuously, Zhifeng Yong went up to 5 yuan, Yuanxing also bought up to 7.5 yuan. Sassoon sold 875 for August US currency, Ruixing sold silver bars to 5 yuan, Yuanmao aggressively bought silver bars, Fuchang bought again, the bank's appetite improved slightly, and went up to 9.5 yuan. At this time, the HSBC exchange rate was announced, flat for British currency and up 375 for US currency. Zhongfu offered 375 for June US currency, HSBC offered 3125 for April, Yifengyong came up to sell, retreating to 8 yuan. After that, it was very calm, and 3125 for June US currency could be settled, hovering around 8 yuan. Central Macgarry also traded 8125 for August US currency, and people's hearts were more stable, with very small fluctuations. Later, because Citibank bought 0625 for May US currency, Hengxing suddenly came to buy bars, rising to 9.5 yuan (the listed price was only 9.4 yuan). Then, because Mitsui offered 3125 for June US currency, Fushun sold silver bars, and went to 7 yuan, Cuitai even sold to 4.5 yuan, Wanxing bought, returning to 5.8 yuan. Trading in the market was light, Fuchang sold a little, and prices fell again. Yuanchun even sold to 4 yuan. Shortly before noon, the closing price was 933.5 yuan. In the afternoon, there was no market because it was Saturday. Goods were auctioned at the same price. The highest price during the morning was 939.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 932.5 yuan, only 7 yuan fluctuation. As a result, it fell back 16.5 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The price was announced because the HSBC Bank US currency listing increased by 375, calculated at 23.625 yuan, with an alloy price of 1015.875 yuan. Based on the closing price, the discount was about 82 yuan, a very small difference from the previous close. This month's accounting has been cleared, May is 955 yuan, June is 934 yuan, and the supplementary water is 955 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was light. In summary, Hengxing, Yuanmao, Fuchang, Yuanxing, Yong, Wanxing, Shunli, Zhifeng Yong, etc., were on the buying side. Hengyu, Bingxing, Ruixing, Yifeng Yong, Ruikang, Fushun, Cuitai, Yuanchun, Yuanmao Yong (on behalf of Bingxing), etc., were all on the selling side. The Dalian gang generally bought in (Wanxing more). Shunli first sold and then bought. The Guangdong gang, Hengxing, held about 200 silver bars. The Dalian gang still held a majority of the June silver bars, with Wanxing holding 3,584 silver bars, and Shunli holding 3,696 silver bars. In addition, Tongfeng, Hengyuanheng, Fuchang, Dadecheng, etc., all held more than 1,000 silver bars, while Yongfeng Yuanmao Yong held less than 1,000. Among the short sellers, Qianchangxiang was the largest, holding 8,841 short positions, Daxingyong held 2,793, Ruixing held 1,638, Hengxing, Shenkang, Hengyu, Yuanda Yong, etc., also held more than 600 short positions. The total (as of the previous day) was 25,053 silver bars.</p>
<p>There were few formal transactions for spot and swap. The initial opening for spot was calculated at a premium of 37 yuan, slightly higher than the previous day, due to the cheap price of futures. Transactions were conducted among colleagues in the market, and the actual price was roughly 40 yuan. For the May-June swap, Dadecheng paid Yingfenghong 28 silver bars, for 26 yuan. The April silver bars have been cleared. For May (as of the previous day), there were still 11,193 silver bars. Only Yingfenghong and Yongfenghong each redeemed 7 official receipts (for April), and Tongfenghong redeemed 14. The official receipts for this month were cleared.</p>

<p>Very Little Trading... Spot Transactions Unheard Of</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market of the Chinese Securities Exchange was extremely stable, due to it being Saturday, and people were in a leisurely mood. Furthermore, there was no significant progress in the current situation, and there were some rumors in the market that the battle at Nantianmen was fierce. There were many short sellers in the market. In the opening auction, the Northern gang sold, and the market price uniformly decreased by two or three jiao to five or six jiao, trending weak. In the second round, Nos. 52 and 35 were still sold, and the previous few continued to decrease by two or three jiao to four jiao. From the 20-level, Nos. 4 and 16 were absorbed quite a bit, so they gradually recovered, and all recovered one to four jiao, with salt tax being the strongest. In the afternoon opening, retail investors bought, short selling suddenly became scarce, and the market price recovered three or five jiao, but the salt tax suddenly declined again, dropping one jiao five fen. The closing trading was even lighter, and the market was chaotic, with prices fluctuating up and down by about two or three jiao. As a result, except for the slightly up 5 fen for the 19-level public welfare, and no change for the demobilization 20-level, the rest dropped one jiao to three jiao, trending mediocre. Trading was very little, and there were no spot transactions at all. For futures, only the public welfare and demobilization 19-level had some trading in June, and the rest were still not asked. The total turnover was only 5.09 million, with the salt tax having the most transactions, only 1.095 million yuan. Demobilization and unified tax were only more than 700,000, and the rest were only 20,000 to 350,000.</p>

<p>Yarn fell in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon, but the situation was still weak. Due to thick inventory, and the decline in the economic situation of all parties, and the war clouds filling North China, those who have cotton yarn are reluctant to let go. The thoughts of those with inventory are rising again. In short, the general trend is not good, and the dumping of inferior yarn at low prices has a great impact. The amount of yarn stored in cloth warehouses is increasing daily.</p>

<p>The opening of the cotton market in the morning, due to the poor US cotton, people's hearts were not light. There was a lack of buyers in the market. Each month fell seven, eight jiao to one yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Sichuan gang had some transactions, and retail investors made up, and each month rose three, five jiao. The total turnover for the day was 31,100 bales. The sales were Dagju 950 bales, Yida 650 bales, Yichang 1,750 bales, Xiesheng 1,150 bales, Yongda 1,250 bales, and Xincheng 700 bales. The purchases were Yiyu 1,550 bales, Gengfeng 2,200 bales, Senkang 1,750 bales, Tongji 800 bales, and Yongchang 750 bales. The closing price is as follows:</p>

<p>The going is still good for current yarn, with a total of 416 bales sold by various gangs throughout the day. Yesterday there were 1,000 bales, and prices fell by 5 jiao. The amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan 1,300 Xiamen 10 Ningbo 25 Shantou 5 Guangdong 50</p>
<p>Northern 15 Inland 80 Southeast Asia 5 Colleagues 31</p>
<p>The flower market is progressing towards a soft path. Due to the implementation of reduced labor by various factories, the demand for raw materials has decreased, and overseas cotton markets are sluggish, and the gold market is flat. It is cheaper to buy imported cotton, so the intention of some manufacturers to sell is very strong. According to their intention, because the yarn-to-flower price ratio is too far apart, there are still short sellers. However, the buyers are tight and will not let go.</p>

<h3 id="e254">Amendments to the Cotton Delivery Inspection Rules of the Yarn Exchange <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>The cotton delivery inspection rules of the yarn exchange have been amended this month and will take effect in October. The following is a summary: (1) All cotton for delivery shall be inspected by the delivery broker after the 15th of each month and up to three days before delivery. (2) When the cotton is inspected, if the grade and standard are consistent, each 100 dan shall be in about 12 burlap bags, about 85 bags per lot, with four sample flowers, each weighing about one pound (etc.). If it is a large machine-packed bale of about 4 dan, about 25 to 27 bags per lot, totaling 100 dan, two bags must be opened for sampling, and two sample flowers must be taken, each weighing about two pounds. If there are two brands in one lot, two more bags should be opened and two more flowers should be taken for separate inspection of the amount of moisture. (3) The moisture content of the cotton shall be 12%, if it is 13%, the price shall be reduced by 1%, and if it exceeds 13%, it shall be deemed unqualified. (4) Cotton of any packaging may be delivered, but unqualified cotton shall be replaced by the deliverer as soon as possible, and shall be delivered by the day before delivery at the latest. If the inspection is still unqualified, and the delivery cannot be made the next day, it shall be deemed a breach of contract. Qualified products shall be given an inspection certificate, which shall be valid for seven days after the delivery of the month. If the owner considers it inappropriate, they may state the reasons and request a re-inspection. If the inspected cotton is not delivered, a water inspection fee of 3 silver yuan per dan and a weighing fee of 3 silver yuan shall be charged. (5) Delivery shall be in units of 100 dan. If there are four or five dan more or less, it shall be calculated according to the delivery price. When delivering cotton, the stack rent and insurance period must have a surplus of more than two days to be considered qualified (if the warehouse is closed, the period may be extended accordingly). All machine species insurance fees shall be paid by the receiver as usual for the convenience of shipment. (6) The receiver of the delivered goods must clear the goods within two days after the delivery date. If the dock receipt has not arrived, the goods must be cleared within two days of the dock receipt's arrival. (7) If the receiving broker believes that the cotton is unqualified within the validity period after delivery, they may request the convening of a standards appraisal meeting, which shall be convened by the exchange on a regular basis to compare the standards and judge them. If the product meets the standards, the appraisal fee shall be paid by the requester. If it is lower than the standard, it shall be borne by the exchange. The cotton appraisal fee is 70 silver yuan per 100 dan, 105 silver yuan for up to five times, and 140 silver yuan for up to ten times. (8) Jiangmaotian, Chuyongxing and Sanzhan were designated as cotton warehouses.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices fell due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, Wall Street selling, and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures fell by 6 to 9 points. Liverpool cotton futures fell by 8 to 9 points, and spot prices fell by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 7 points. The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to profit-taking, but later slightly strengthened due to buying by European exporters. As a result, Pingor fell by 1 rupee, Omra fell by 1 rupee 2.5 annas, and White Broach fell by 0.5 panna. Details are appended on the left. (Telegraphic dispatch dated April 28)</p>

<p>New York, April 26 - Weekly Cotton Market Situation: Raw cotton prices rose at the beginning of the week, but as urgent demand was met, the market showed a reactive sentiment and a tendency for profit-taking, which was further amplified when converting US dollars to British pounds. The debate in the Senate on the inflationary amendment to the rural relief bill caused some doubts about the final provisions of this plan. However, the authorities will clearly adopt measures to raise prices. Editor's note: According to recent news from Washington, the rural relief bill and its inflationary amendment have been passed by the Senate. News of a new cotton planting has been repeatedly delayed, and winter rainfall in the Southwest is lower than in the past, which can also be seen as an unfavorable factor for the future of cotton cultivation. Inflationary speculation has boosted demand for cotton, but cotton mills are only willing to sell futures for May or early June. There has been little change in the idea of cotton acreage. As for whether the rural relief bill can be implemented in time and affect cotton planting, this doubt is gradually increasing.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Silk and Tea - Spring Silkworms in Zhejiang Can Still Be Salvaged <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>(Shaoxing) In the villages, many silkworm farmers raised native breeds this year, but the weather was unfavorable, with continuous cold rain for weeks. The early batch of native silkworms almost suffered complete losses, but the late batch of foreign breeds has rarely been abandoned. Silkworm farmers in areas such as Lizhu, Wangtan, and Tangpu, knowing that mulberry trees produce leaves later, all raised improved breeds. After the silkworm eggs hatched, the weather turned sunny and warm, and the silkworms' development improved. The early batch has now reached the third molt, with uniform molting. The late batch in areas such as Anchang, Hengxi, and Tianle Township has also reached the second molt with abundant leaves, and the current situation is quite good.</p>
<p>(Anji) Although the silkworm season in various towns and villages is later than in Hangzhou, incubation began before the Grain Rain festival. This year, the weather has been severely cold, and mulberry trees are budding later, so the silkworm season is about half a month later than last year. Currently, the weather is sunny and warm, and mulberry leaves are gradually flourishing. Silkworm farmers, aware of the disadvantages of native silkworms in Hangzhou, are all raising improved breeds. Although the feeding volume is not smooth in areas such as Meixi and Dipu, foreign silkworms have hatched quite uniformly and are developing well due to the suitable climate. The early batch has been in dormancy for four or five days, and the late silkworms have also started feeding on trial leaves. If the weather does not change again, the spring silkworms in Zhejiang can still be salvaged.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Several News Items Regarding New Tea <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>Qimen Black Tea Begins Harvesting and Production</p>
<p>Qimen black tea, around this time last year, the tribute teas of various firms had already been harvested and dried. This year, the climate has been consistently cold, and the heavy rain for four days last week severely restricted the development of tea buds. Fortunately, the weather suddenly turned sunny and warm in the past two days, and the Mao Feng and Bai Mao varieties are just right for harvesting. Farmers in various mountains are preparing to take advantage of this sunny weather and open their gardens immediately. Harvesting has already begun on the southwest routes. The tea workers and buyers of the last batch of each firm have all gathered in recent days and are busily preparing to leave for the villages to start weighing and compete to collect the green leaves. With such consistently sunny and warm weather, the top-quality tribute teas will receive dew nourishment in the morning and benefit from drying in the sun during the day, so the product will definitely be excellent. Tea firms are delighted by this weather, and farmers, confident in the superior quality of their goods, are announcing that they will not sell cheaply. Currently, the main goal of the firms is to avoid repeating last year's high mountain prices and heavy losses. Regardless of the weather this year, they are unanimously determined not to undercut each other and drive up prices. With this approach, it remains to be seen whether prices can be lowered as desired.</p>
<p>Wuyuan Tea Market Gradually Shows Signs of Improvement</p>
<p>Recently, due to the sunny and warm weather, the buds of Zhouyuan tea in Wuyuan County have been growing longer. In previous years, farmers in various mountains would have already hired tea workers and gone to the market to buy goods and food, creating a bustling scene. Now, as the new tea is about to be harvested, poor farmers are unable to borrow money from merchants and cannot obtain goods on credit, and they have not yet purchased rice, oil, firewood, and other necessities. This state of distress is rarely seen. Among the tea firms in various villages, those with strong financial resources are already preparing to open their businesses, while those with depleted funds are still watching and waiting to regain their footing due to tightened credit from banks. In total, about 60% of the old and new tea firms in the villages have decided to open their businesses this year. The demand for various items used by tea firms, such as box boards, firewood, and charcoal, which have been neglected for a long time, is gradually increasing as the firms open their businesses, and orders are becoming more sought after. The livelihood of mountain farmers has thus been slightly eased. However, prices are still difficult to recover as sales are lower than in the past. Overall, the tea market has shown signs of improvement this week.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan Mao Tea Begins Weighing</p>
<p>The green tea in areas such as Xiaoshan, Zhuji, and Yuyao in Zhejiang Province has been in demand in recent years as local firms send personnel to compete for the purchase of tender tips and offer higher prices for selected leaves. As a result, tea farmers in various areas are all harvesting earlier. Yesterday, a tea factory received a letter from Xiaoshan stating that the new tea in that area had begun to be weighed, with a price of 68 yuan per dan. Those with superior quality are selling for 75 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Suian New Tea Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>

<h3 id="e261">Weekend Silk Market Remains Sluggish <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>There was nothing good to report in the silk market yesterday. Overseas prices were stable, but domestic demand was weak. Transactions totaled only 10 bales of Month-free silk at 850 yuan, 20 bales of San Tiao Wu coarse green striped silk at 830 yuan, and 5 bales of 83-degree even silk at 710 yuan. In the past two weeks, the highest New York price was 1.54 and the lowest was 1.22, a difference of 0.32, a gain of 26%. The highest US exchange rate was 21.375 and the lowest was 25.00, a difference of 3.75, a decrease of 17%. According to this observation, it seems that the price increase is due to the exchange rate decrease, and transactions should be quite smooth. However, firstly, exporters are afraid to take risks due to the unstable market; secondly, the previous price difference was too large, resulting in no transactions; now, the rising trend is just enough to bring buyers and sellers closer together, but it has not yet attracted many sellers; thirdly, new silk has not yet been thrown on the market, and the quality of the existing stock is poor; fourthly, consumer prices are still high, and sellers prefer to sell to foreign firms. Therefore, the number of transactions in this period is only about 1,000 bales. Appended below are overseas market prices (April 28):</p>
<p>Market	Grade	Price	Exchange Rate	Equivalent in National Currency</p>
<p>New York	Standard Silk	1.50	24.625	744</p>
<p>London	Hua Silk A Grade	8 Shillings	1.3.50	756</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 boats arrived from Changbang No. 5, Sutongbang No. 5, Nangang No. 3, Qingjiaobang No. 17, Sifengjing No. 3, and Songjiang No. 6. Due to the limited supply of Sutongbang and Nangang rice, and the continued purchase of 400-500 bags of thick Japonica rice by Nanyang Xinghuabang, and also the favorable demand in this street, prices were raised by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Northern merchants from Tianjin, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and other places continued to purchase more than 20 loads of Qingjiao, Songjiang, Sijing, and other thin Indica rice, totaling nearly 3,000 bags. However, due to strict demand, prices only rose slightly by a few cents to 0.1 yuan. However, it is predicted that the market will not be as prosperous as today's market because it is Sunday. There is no Yangjian rice, Dujian rice is popular, and prices have risen by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Changbang Japonica rice and Bianyuan rice are stable because of ordinary intake. Yinyuan rice is in short supply, so it meets its expectations, and prices rise accordingly, so the market conditions have increased by 0.2-0.3 yuan to several cents.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 10 boats arrived from the lower reaches of the river, and white Japonica rice sales gradually increased. Market prices were high, with an extra foot outside the standard. Thin Japonica and early rice arrivals were few and sales were active, and prices were tight, with an extra foot. Yang Dujian rice arrivals were not strong, and retail sales were also flat. The market was slightly tight. Wharf rice was scarce, and guest rice was tight by a few cents. The prices of Yin Bianyuan were fixed.</p>
<h3 id="e263">7,000 Bags of Standard Flour Delivered <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery date for April, and the daily delivery volume was still not very smooth. Because major manufacturers had gradually reduced production beforehand, and customers had also settled most of their transactions, the delivery process was uneventful. Only Xinda Factory delivered 7,000 bags of Green Fortress flour because it had not completed its obligations. The receiving parties were all from this street.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Minor Decline in Wheat Futures <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures were generally flat and weak. The quoted price for foreign wheat was about 7.7 Chicago cents and 3 Canadian cents, so after the opening, the trend of each month remained flat. There were still no transactions in June and July, but transactions were still active in July, August, and September. However, the major players did not sell, so the decline was minimal. As a result, July fell by one cent, August was unchanged, and September fell by one cent. It is reported that more than 10 cars have been delivered this month, and the actual delivery volume is expected to be around 15 cars.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Improved Bean Cake Sales Due to Sunny Weather <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Bean cake sales have improved due to the sunny weather, and the market is still stable. Yesterday, there were inquiries for both domestic and export bean cake, and a total of 12,000-13,000 pieces of factory and guest bean cake were sold in the city. If the weather remains sunny, sales will definitely increase, and market prices are expected to rise. Beancake factories continued to purchase, and 15 cars were transacted yesterday. The Xiamen factory brought in 2 cars, and the market was slightly improved by 0.01-0.02 yuan. Sales to Chongming, Sha County, Fuzhou, Shantou, Wenzhou, and Taizhou were active, totaling more than 1,200 bags. The market price increased by 0.03-0.04 yuan, and the situation was quite firm.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Continued Rise in Guest Indica Rice by 0.05-0.06 Yuan <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, sales of foreign Guest Indica rice remained active, and prices continued to rise by 0.05-0.06 yuan. Recent arrivals have been few, and Guest traders are unwilling to sell at limited prices, and even vendors are mostly watching. Therefore, the market is firm. The Fuzhou factory is still greedy, and yesterday it purchased 1,700 bags of Jiangxi machine-processed late rice at 8.5-8.95 yuan, 240 bags of Hunan machine-processed oil rice at 8.73-8.825 yuan, and 270 bags of machine-processed red rice at 8.1 yuan, and 600 bags of small twisted rice at 7.45 yuan. Of the small twisted rice, 100 bags were sold by this street, and 500 bags were sold to Wenzhou. Of the machine-processed red rice, more than 100 bags were sold to Tianjin, and the rest were purchased by Fujian factories.</p>

<p>Transaction Price 21 Yuan</p>
<p>The sales of Longkou vermicelli have been abnormally sluggish recently, so the market price has repeatedly fallen. The price of genuine brand guest goods once opened at about 21 yuan, and the price of secondary brands did not reach 21 yuan, a drop of about 1 yuan compared to the middle of last month. The low market price is rarely seen in recent years. The arrival and stock of Yantai vermicelli are both scarce, and the supply has been temporarily cut off. Yesterday's market transaction price was 21 yuan, but sales were still low. The local price is also similar to Shanghai. With the market price at this level, the future is unlikely to have a large rise.</p>

<p>After the production area announced a price drop for Annamese tin, the local industry initially wanted to maintain the price due to the potential for heavy losses. However, due to sluggish sales, abundant arrivals, and manipulation by brokers, the standard price gradually declined. The current market price is 329 yuan per ton, a further decrease of 5 yuan compared to before. It is rumored that a merchant from Hankou offered a price of only 320 yuan in Shanghai, which has further increased anxiety.</p>

<p>Regulations for the Children's Music Broadcasting Competition Jointly Organized by Yongsheng Radio Station, Children's Morning Post, and Hengsen Radio Station</p>
<p>In order to promote children's art and guide children's proper entertainment, this station has specially organized a children's music broadcasting competition. The detailed methods are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Children's music is temporarily divided into (1) singing (such as singing operas, Kunqu operas, etc.) (2) stringed instruments (such as jinghu, erhu, sanxian, etc.) (3) wind instruments (such as flute, xiao, etc.) (4) Western instruments (such as bugle, harmonica, organ, viola, etc.).

<h3 id="e270">Further Discussion on the Root Causes of China's Problems <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>Since the issue of the location of the root causes of China's problems was published in the previous two issues of Amateur Chat, many readers have written to raise questions and request more detailed explanations. The content of the letters can be roughly divided into two categories:</p>
<p>(1) Why did the system collapse, and why did the culture disappear?</p>
<p>(2) They are eager to know the methods of remedy and the steps to be taken.</p>
<p>Regarding the first category of questions, a detailed explanation would have to include the ancient and modern Chinese history, which is beyond the capacity of this publication. Fortunately, we received a manuscript from Mr. Nie Zhi, which contains a passage that can be used as a concise answer to our explanation of the first category of questions. Its content is: "The current China is a semi-colonial China, an economically backward China. It is plagued by the shackles of international capitalist imperialism externally and suffers from the trampling of warlords and bureaucrats internally. The national economy cannot develop entirely because the lifelines of the country, such as customs, mines, factories, finance, and transportation, are directly or indirectly controlled by the hands of imperialism; and the internal economic organization collapses precisely because warlords and bureaucrats launch internal wars from time to time, freely increase exorbitant taxes and issue public bonds, and force the cultivation of opium and other acts of self-enrichment. In this environment riddled with holes, the success of the Chinese national liberation movement is definitely not the 'blood purchase' of a few high-ranking Chinese officials who want to preserve their titles; and for the sake of preserving their titles, they even put pressure on the uprising of the downtrodden lower-class people, as if they must be completely wiped out before they are satisfied! Facts speak louder than words. From the Qing government to the Beiyang warlords, and now to the present, there has been a consistent system that answers the riddle of 'I would rather give it to a friend than to a family slave'! Thus, the so-called 'integrity,' 'morality,' and 'duty' naturally ran into the land of nothingness. In the so-called land of Chinese civilization, the upper echelons 'sing praises and virtues' and have to act as 'talking parrots more poisonous than snakes'; the lower echelons 'scurry like dogs and operate like flies' and have to imitate the 'sending off the old and welcoming the new' prostitutes!"</p>
<p>In this situation, we can see the reasons for the collapse of the system and the crux of why a new culture cannot be produced.</p>
<p>When it comes to the issue of remedy, we deeply feel that although China's current symptoms are extremely dangerous, they are definitely not incurable. As long as more and more people in the country realize the danger, more and more people feel the pain, and the number of people who are prepared to spare no sacrifice to fight against imperialism externally and warlords and bureaucrats internally increases to a considerable extent, the day of national liberation will be near. We express our acceptance and satisfaction with all the questions raised by readers regarding the location of the root causes of China's problems. We, like the readers, feel that we must recognize the fundamental danger of our nation before we can determine the direction of our struggle and adopt more effective means. This abstract answer may still cause dissatisfaction among some readers, but in this era, being able to openly talk about these things is still considered fortunate!</p>

<p>— Ms. Liao Yinxiang</p>
<p>Flower Seller</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Suzhou for sightseeing will probably have a slight impression of us! Every night around three o'clock, we go to the mountains together. Half of those engaged in this profession live near Mudu, but to pick fresh flowers, one must go to Tiger Hill, Tianping, or the Guanyin Temple in Qizi, as these mountains have different flowers. Therefore, we also pick flowers according to the season. Almost 360 days a year, there is always a flower to pick. From our residence to the nearest mountain, the furthest being about twenty li, if we go to pick them a bit late, we often can’t make it to the Suzhou morning market on time.</p>
<p>After picking the flowers, we return to Changmen in Suzhou—the place where our customers are concentrated—at the earliest around nine o'clock in the morning. As soon as we arrive at Changmen, many flower brokers are waiting. Two-thirds of these flowers are</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>bought by them. If we take them to the flower stalls in the city, we won’t be able to sell them for much money. The remaining ones are taken by ourselves to various hotels to hawk. In the past one or two years, there were often times when there weren’t enough to sell, but in recent years, even if we sell until two or three o'clock in the afternoon, we still have a small half left. This isn’t because we aren’t willing to lower the price, but simply because there are too few buyers. At the latest, we must return by four o'clock. When we get home, we eat something and immediately go to sleep, otherwise, we won’t have enough energy for the next day. For lunch, we usually just bring some dry food to eat on the road. When business is good, we sometimes buy something to eat in Suzhou. We work for our food and clothing for what is said to be seventeen or eighteen hours, of which a large part of the time is spent on the road back and forth.</p>
<p>Engaging in this kind of business is remarkably hard. Not only is there often a lack of sleep, but also the daily long treks and the invasion of wind, frost, rain, and snow are not something that people without habit and training can endure. As a result, the money earned each day is barely enough to maintain my own life, and perhaps not even enough. Moreover, we have to give a portion to the hotel tea servers; otherwise, they will sabotage our transactions, and even not allow us to enter the hotel doors.</p>
<p>As for the mental suffering, it is even more unspeakable. Being bullied and humiliated is unavoidable every day; from the beginning of the transaction until we return home, we are constantly struggling in depression. Those young male flower brokers, hotel tea servers, and frivolous buyers often mock us, and even get physical. But no matter how embarrassing it is, we have to endure and smile obsequiously; otherwise, we will cut off our own means of making a living.</p>
<p>The fact that flower sellers are seduced or raped is constantly happening. As a result, many people like me unconsciously degenerate. Of course, most people who engage in this profession are not fortunate enough to receive education, but they have a deep understanding of and can put into practice the philosophical saying, "If not perfect, then rather nothing." Since our reputation is already ruined, and the stain on the white jade is irreparable, then why not sell ourselves happily? The material price obtained from selling oneself once exceeds the income from a month or more of hard work picking flowers, so we become actively willing after being passively forced. Some flower sellers also engage in prostitution, but for these people, selling flowers is only a side job. Every morning, they buy some flowers from us flower pickers to peddle. The reason they don't give up selling flowers is that it allows them to get to know more customers. Not only are they unwilling to engage in the hard work of picking flowers anymore, but they also don't have the time to go up the mountain in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>As for me? Fortunately, my father is the prompter in the X opera theater, and my mother is a predecessor in selling flowers, now engaged in miscellaneous jobs such as laundry in the X hotel. Therefore, some flower brokers and tea servers have old ties with us, and some I even have to call them "father's friends" as a sign of respect! Six years ago, when I was only twelve years old, I started selling flowers with my mother, so I am often seen as a child, and I rarely receive unbearable words or actions. Sometimes when some customers make things difficult for me, they come to my rescue. But even so, I have already suffered enough!</p>
<p>I remember that six years ago, this flower-selling business could barely be done, but in the recent year, judging by the number of flower pickers alone, there are only eleven or twelve people left, a reduction of about 70%. The number of flower sellers has also decreased by half. However, the supply of flowers always exceeds the demand, and the market downturn can be imagined. Therefore, for the sake of business, flower sellers often squeeze each other out, and many of them go to the city to do business with residents. And we flower pickers, now due to the sluggish business, even running to hotels is of no use. So we only pick flowers and often don’t sell them anymore, and the flower sellers are no longer the flower pickers. This is a big change that didn't exist before! However, we are not disappointed or pessimistic because of this. Let the flowers of the old era gradually wither away, but we believe that the flowers of the new era will bud and bloom from this point on. At that time, the various shackles that are locked on us will be transformed into beautiful garlands of victory, and we will also become "people" among the flowers!</p>

<h3 id="e273">How Should Workers Maintain Their Livelihoods When Yarn Factories Reduce Work Case <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Proposer: Councilor Ms. Li Liumei</p>
<p>I am a female worker in the XX yarn factory. I can earn more than ten yuan a month, which is used to support my disabled old mother and myself, and I already feel that it is very insufficient. Now the manager says that because of the dumping of Japanese yarn, the factory's products are not selling well, and a decision has been made to reduce work. According to the reduced wages, I can only earn eight yuan a month, and the household expenses are even more insufficient. At that time, I discussed the ways to live in the future with several sisters. One sister said that people have been talking about boycotting Japanese goods since last year, so why can Japanese yarn still be dumped in our country now? This must be a trick by the manager to deal with us workers. Another sister said that starting yesterday, Japanese yarn factories have also reduced work. I asked her, since Japanese yarn has already been dumped in our country, why do they also need to reduce work? That sister said that the Japanese devils also say that yarn sales are not smooth! I was just about to say something, but before I could, one sister抢着(qiǎngzhe - interjected) said, if Chinese yarn factories reduce work and Japanese yarn factories also reduce work, then won't Chinese yarn factories have to reduce work even more? For the sake of making money, their domestic capitalists and foreign capitalists reduce work when you reduce work, they fight back and forth, but they don't care, but what about the lives of us workers? What about me, and my disabled fifty-four-year-old mother, how will we live?</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e275">It Is Both Theory and Fact Zhao Wenyuan <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>In the previous issues of this publication's special issue on female workers, there are two very obvious facts being manifested: one is the absolute or relative increase of female laborers in various industrial sectors, and the other is the absolute or relative decrease of male laborers in various industrial sectors, and the further fact that female laborers are driving male laborers out of all industrial sectors and implementing a monopoly over all labor sectors. This is a phenomenon unique to the current capitalist society, and there is no need for us to doubt it. As long as one examines the facts of the industrial revolution's evolution in various countries, it is not difficult to grasp the core of this issue.</p>
<p>The industrial revolution has made the greatest effort in the completion of capitalism. It is the death knell of the old society, and at the same time, it is the harbinger of the birth of the new society. It has simplified human labor, so that the manual labor required for spinning and weaving is mainly limited to connecting broken threads. Because all other labor is taken over by machines. Therefore, this labor does not require much effort, and only requires skillful movements with the fingers. In these simplified industrial sectors, female laborers can naturally work without needing much skill or strength. Therefore, those skilled and physically strong male laborers have reduced their original required area and are quickly squeezed out of their respective labor sectors. Moreover, the wages paid to female laborers are also very low. This fact of using cheap wages is even more beneficial to the capitalist class, which gains surplus value by reducing production costs. In this way, female laborers sweep everything away and monopolize all labor sectors.</p>
<p>The result of women monopolizing the labor market will at least cause the following repercussions. The first is that most or even all of the male laborers are squeezed out and roam the streets, forming a large industrial reserve army. The second is the reduction of labor value, so that the result of the laboring class working hard throughout the year is not enough to maintain their minimum standard of living, leading to widespread impoverishment. The third is that the mortality rate of children who leave their mothers, who must go to society to sell their labor, shows a sharp increase due to the lack of constant care. This phenomenon is being enacted very rapidly from England, the birthplace of the industrial revolution, to various colonial countries where industry has only recently developed. This is the most common phenomenon in the international community, and it is also a characteristic of the world's current physical state.</p>
<p>In order to prepare for a rainy day, our country, which is in this atmosphere, should, in the passive aspect, make it impossible for this phenomenon to be repeated in our country; and in the active aspect, begin to reform the social system that produces this phenomenon. We must ensure that every young man and woman has the opportunity to share labor and enjoy the benefits together, and never allow the biased phenomenon of men excluding women or women excluding men to appear in the labor world. Make all of human material civilization a source of public happiness, and do not let it become a shackle to the evolution of human society. This is the true meaning of human control of the material world.</p>
<p>Notes on the Daily Life of Heroes A Certain Manager</p>
<h3 id="e276">Broken Leather Shoes Ms. Xiang Ling <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Ling, who graduated from high school but couldn't afford to go to college, stayed at home and brooded for two whole years. Later, thanks to a friend's introduction, he got a job as a junior clerk in a certain foreign firm.</p>
<p>Ling had suffered enough from the taste of being idle at home and the shame of being unemployed for two years. Now he actually ran briskly into the magnificent foreign firm on the road every day, unlike before when he ran on ordinary days, he used to avoid acquaintances in a fluster; the sad mood of the rice jar being empty at home in the past was also gone. Ling was as happy as all the young people who had just found a job, and he cherished many fantasies.</p>
<p>The manager was a tall American. Because he had always had a very comfortable life, he had grown fat and strong. One day, the manager suddenly asked Ling to take a pair of black leather shoes with broken soles to the cheapest shoe store for repair. The manager said, "The quality must be good, and the time must be fast. These shoes are genuine American goods, and it would be a pity to lose them."</p>
<p>Ling was very unhappy in his heart. Why didn't a dignified manager take his shoes to a foreign shoe store, but insisted on a Chinese person taking them to a Chinese store for repair? How meticulous he is! But these shoes are the manager's! So after using all his brainpower to compare the many shoe stores he knew in his heart, he finally took them to a shoe store that he thought was the most reliable. After agreeing on a price of two yuan, he instructed the clerk:</p>
<p>"These shoes belong to our manager. The quality must be good, and I'll pick them up the day after tomorrow!"</p>
<p>The third day arrived, but the manager didn't mention the shoes, nor did he give him the money to pick them up. Ling was already very anxious in his heart. That afternoon, he went to the shoe store on the way to work to pick up the shoes and bring them back to the firm.</p>
<p>The manager had already arrived at the firm. He was leaning back in a comfortable chair, reading a newspaper, with a large cigar in his mouth. Ling, carrying the shoes, strode into the magnificent manager's office, as if he had done something meritorious. The manager didn't move at all, but kept reading the newspaper. Ling tremblingly placed the shoes in front of the manager.</p>
<p>"Oh, goodll!" the manager called out, picked up the shoes and looked them over. Suddenly his face turned red, his eyes widened in anger, and he threw the shoes on the ground with a bang: "I don't want this kind of dog skin! Take it apart!"</p>
<p>Ling's heart was pounding, and his face turned pale. A burst of anger rushed to his heart. He wanted to scold this Westerner fiercely, then put on his hat and go home! But he didn't have that kind of courage. He finally bent down, picked up the shoes, and went to that shoe store again. Because his subconscious told him: his mother and younger brother were relying on him for this job to eat! He said to the shoe store clerk:</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry!：：：My manager is a pig! He said the leather wasn't good and wanted it taken apart. Please reduce the price a little bit. I'll pay for it myself. I'm just unlucky!"</p>
<p>That clerk was still polite and agreed to reduce the price by one yuan.</p>
<p>Ling seemed to have escaped a disaster as he carried the shoes back to the firm. He angrily placed the shoes on the manager's desk. The manager didn't say a word and didn't even look at Ling. The bills and invoices piled up on Ling's desk, and he,</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>stared blankly at the typewriter, unable to concentrate on his work.</p>
<p>When he went home for dinner in the evening, his mother saw that he was silent and asked, "Ling, why do you look so unhappy tonight? Did the manager scold you?" "No, no," Ling replied quickly before he even swallowed a mouthful of rice, and tears almost flowed down.</p>

<p>— Yi Niao</p>
<p>The Garret</p>
<p>After toiling in the company for a whole day, I returned to my dormitory in the evening: the garret. It was time to rest. I walked to the edge of the bed and sat down. After lying down for a while, I opened a literary work I had just bought yesterday. Just as I was engrossed in reading, a burst of laughter and talking suddenly entered my ears:</p>
<p>"One missing for mahjong!" It seemed to be the voice of the woman upstairs in the front. "Playing mahjong? I'm in!" said the woman upstairs in the back.</p>
<p>In no time, they started their work with "Pi! Pa!" This made me embarrassed. I read the book for a while and then went to turn it off. I pondered for a moment, looked at the alarm clock on the windowsill, and the short hand was pointing to half past nine. I thought, I'd better go to bed early, so as not to hear those annoying sounds. So I opened the blanket.</p>
<p>But the opposite was true. The sound of "Pi! Pa!" was even more distinct. This was terrible! If I put my head in the blanket, it would be unhygienic. But the sound of mahjong would not stop for a moment. There was no way out, so I had to bite the bullet and get into the blanket. This seemed better, but it was stuffy and difficult to breathe, very uncomfortable. Finally, I barely entered the land of dreams.</p>
<p>"Pong! Eat! Win!" Just as I was having a sweet dream, I was suddenly awakened by them. The reason was that my head was no longer in the blanket. I turned on the light, rubbed my eyes, and looked at the clock. It was already twelve o'clock. At this time, I became furious. It's already the middle of the night, and they're still not tired of playing. Don't they care that people need to sleep? The thought of "moving out" came to my mind again, but if I moved out, would I be able to completely avoid hearing the sound of mahjong? As I thought of this, there was another burst of children crying. I sighed deeply and got back into my blanket.</p>
<p>"Chacha chacha," suddenly a sound of dumping the chamber pot broke my sweet dream. I opened my drowsy eyes and looked out the window. A faint ray of sunlight had already shone on the corner of someone's house. At this time, the sound of mahjong in my ears changed to the "chacha" sound of the chamber pot.</p>
<p>I got up and put on my clothes, wanting to open the window to get some fresh air, but the disgusting stench had already rushed in. The "chacha" sound became even more intense. I couldn't open it, so I had to close it.</p>
<p>Ah! I don't even have the right to get fresh air. I went out to wash my face, and I had to press the abacus. After washing up, I walked out of my dormitory and stepped back into the company to struggle for life.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Evidence of Crime <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>I am a junior clerk in a company. I have to get to the company before seven o'clock every day, and I can't go home until it's dark. Sometimes I even have to work overtime.</p>
<p>The manager looks down on us. He doesn't allow us to take leave, and one day of leave will be deducted one day's pay. Even being half an hour late will be fined. The same goes for leaving early.</p>
<p>One day, I got up early and left without eating breakfast as usual. I live far away from the company, and I have to take a bus or tram.</p>
<p>I stood at the bus stop waiting for a long time, but I still didn't see the shadow of the bus. I was getting angry in my heart. At this time, the clock hand was already pointing to half past six. Finally, the bus came, but it was a reserved car. After a while, a bus full of passengers came, and even the door wouldn't open, no matter how much you shouted. Three buses passed in a row, and they were all like that.</p>
<p>It was already seven o'clock, but I was still standing at the bus stop. If I wanted to take a rickshaw, it would cost me forty cents, but my daily income is at most sixty cents. Alas, I really wanted to die at that time!</p>
<p>Finally, I arrived at the company at seven forty-five. The manager called me to go, and I knew that a scolding was unavoidable.</p>
<p>"Why are you late?" he said, "I've already arrived, and you're still not here?"</p>
<p>"I really couldn't get a bus," I answered in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Hmph, you never used to wait for the bus, but today you're waiting for the bus!"</p>
<p>This sentence was the evidence of my crime. This time, the punishment I received was not great, but I couldn't stand this grievance!</p>
<p>Alas, what should I do? Do I have to be their ox and horse, exhausting my spirit for them until I die?</p>

<p>— Ruo Zhou</p>
<p>This is a general rule. When everything is in the process of transition from old to new, the old things are never willing to die quietly. They always struggle, hoping that their lives will be prolonged unexpectedly. The closer they get to death, the more fierce their struggle becomes. In the last moment, they will even take out the most cruel, shameless, and at the same time, the most naive and ridiculous methods to fight with the new, trying to seize back their dying fate from this last gasp of struggle. But the facts ultimately do not allow them to do so. Everything, everything, is moving forward at all times. The universe is constantly running. The old is bound to die, and the new will eventually rise. No matter how desperately they struggle, the result is still in vain. Moreover, because of their excessive struggle, it will cause their accelerated collapse. Struggle or not, history never stays and never retreats.</p>
<p>I remember that when the revolutionary army started the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, Sun Chuanfang, a warlord in Southeast China, although he hated the revolution, because the revolutionary army had not directly conflicted with his own interests for a while, although he had already imposed a kind of oppression on the revolutionary forces lurking under his rule, it was not very cruel. Newspapers in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas could still see records about the activities of the Kuomintang. Later, as the revolutionary army progressed steadily, it had occupied Jiangxi in a few months. Sun Chuanfang's rule was obviously shaken, and his fate was obviously declining day by day. So he began to make a fierce struggle and began to cruelly suppress the revolutionary forces. At that time, not to mention that the newspapers no longer saw records about the activities of the Kuomintang, as long as a copy of the Three Principles of the People was found in the bookshelf, it would be executed immediately. Even casually discussing the current situation was also in danger of being beheaded. Secret agents were everywhere along the Hu-Ning Road, and countless young people were killed for no reason. Li Baozhang, a well-known executioner, his broadsword team was even more murderous in Shanghai. At that time, it was simply a dark age, a terrible age, rarely seen in history. Sun Chuanfang and the others thought that this cruel policy of violence would definitely suppress the revolutionary forces and definitely re-stabilize their rule. But what was the fact? The old still declined, and the new still rose!</p>
<p>It is said that the times are different now. It is certainly not appropriate to talk much about things like resisting Japan and opposing imperialism. Even talking about personal matters of eating, such as how hard life is, etc., is said to be extremely dangerous. It is clear that we are suffering from unbearable oppression, but those oppressors insist that there is no such thing. It is clear that we should complain, we should cry out, but they simply don't allow you to complain, they simply don't allow you to cry out. Of course, many people simply don't listen to their words, insist on complaining, insist on crying out, and then they will move to cover your mouth, and they will:：：, to the point where they can't complain, can't cry out, and then stop.</p>
<p>In this way, the temporary victory at present seems to belong to them, but wait! What does history tell us? In fact, they have not gained any victory. All their efforts only prove that the tide of revolution has already reached the highest point, and their prosperous fate will also be completely overthrown in this last struggle. If you don't believe it, watch!</p>

<h3 id="e281">An Unofficial History of Employment Agencies <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Dan Sheng</p>
<p>Chapter X: A Dead End - The Desperate Idiot Hopes for Collapse; Dan Fan Dances with Hunger and Seeks Refuge at an Employment Agency</p>
<p>It is said that Dan Fan Sheng heard the person next door lamenting to himself, "Rent, the landlord will be here again in two days to collect; rice, there's only enough for two more days of porridge; firewood money, I can't keep owing that at the end of the month. I really don't know why my father made me study these life-destroying books. Did he expect me to file lawsuits on the waterfront? If I die, what will happen to my family, the old and the young? I'd rather the heavens collapsed sooner so we can all die and be done with it! Heaven, are you going to collapse or not? How much longer are you going to torment us?"</p>
<p>Hearing this, Dan Fan Sheng found the man's madness laughable, but he himself was in the same boat. He couldn't laugh and was instead filled with his own troubles. He thought, three years ago, he was also a parasite in a high-ranking official's household. But because he saw his aging father using blood, sweat, and brains to earn money that was wasted on those young masters' entertainment, he felt it was not only worthless but also troubled his conscience. So, he steeled himself and abandoned the life of a "hotel" where he was reserved for a high-ranking position and went out to serve society. Although he was by nature foolish, he could still write ABCs and count 3x1=3 and 4x1=4. So, three months after joining the organization, he earned 45 dollars a month. Who knew the Japanese devils would come and destroy his ancestors! In order to economize and prepare for long-term resistance, he reduced expenses, the organization merged, and Dan Fan Sheng packed his bags and went back to his hometown to eat hometown rice. But blessings never come in pairs, and misfortunes never come alone. This year, his sixty-year-old father, who had worked at the shop for thirty years, was also affected by the situation and the shop closed down. His old parents, two younger siblings, and an older brother who had gone off to be an apprentice, all depended on him. Thinking of this, Dan Fan Sheng couldn't help but be infected by the person next door and also wished "the heavens would collapse sooner."</p>
<p>But afterward, Dan Fan Sheng understood that the heavens would not collapse. But solving the problems on his shoulders was almost like squeezing the juice out of his brain, and he couldn't think of an effective solution. Rely on friends? But his friends were also thinking of relying on friends. Find relatives? But his relatives were also looking to find relatives. It was truly "no way to go to heaven, no door to enter the earth." Suddenly, a light flashed in Dan Fan Sheng's eyes, and he thought of a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>It turned out that Dan Fan Sheng remembered an old lady who was said to be sixty years old last year and was looking for something to do. She had opened an employment agency at 24 Hankou Road. She was kindhearted, and she didn't charge anyone she helped find employment. But he heard that the employment agency was small, and when it first opened, the old lady's room was almost broken down by the many eager applicants. Later, he heard that she was compassionate and opened up some space in her back room. But he didn't know if there was still room to accommodate later applicants.</p>
<p>Dan Fan Sheng didn't think about it anymore. He found half a sheet of white paper in the pile of broken books, picked up a writing brush, and wrote a line of "Big Sale" in three characters, and below it, he wrote, "Regardless of cost, half price, original price 45 dollars." Dan Fan Sheng knew that this year was a time of price reductions in all industries, so he stole this concept. After writing, he stuck it on his long gown, got on his two-wheeled vehicle, and rushed towards the employment agency. When he arrived at the door of the shop, he saw that it lived up to its reputation. The small shop was filled with a dark mass of people. Dan Fan Sheng tiptoed and saw that the proprietress, despite her age, was not spared any effort. She was standing on tiptoes, busy and happy. Dan Fan Sheng wiped the cold sweat on his forehead and stepped inside, not knowing how the proprietress would treat him. Listen to her own explanation in the next chapter.</p>

<h3 id="e282">New Atmosphere in the Australian Film Industry (Part 2) <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Weng</p>
<p>Film giants realize the outflow of money</p>
<p>Join forces to organize large companies to resist imported products</p>
<p>Snowy Scene is currently producing a film called "The Squatter's Daughter," which describes the realities of life on a sheep station. This large sheep station is run by one person. Its area is about the same size as England. An English county can be placed in the corner of this large pasture. The film that is prepared to be produced next is called "The Silence of Dean Maitland." Its story is based on a famous novel and sets the background in a peaceful English village, where there are raging waves and fishing scenes. And the protagonists in the play are those vulgar and sincere villagers. Thus, all the secrets of Australia will be revealed on the screen.</p>
<p>Both of these films will be directed by Hall (Ken G. Hall), and Captain Frank Hurley will assist from the side. He is the director of photography for the world-famous Shackleton Antarctic Expedition. He once bet Shackleton that he would find the film that was washed away by the iceberg in the icy waters. As a result, Shackleton lost. He also flew in an airplane to the clouds of New Guinea to shoot a film.</p>
<p>In the near future, those strange films will be produced in Australia and its southern neighbors. Not long ago, a nephew of Sir Harry, who led the cavalry to conquer Palestine, went to Batukelu Island in the South Pacific to make a film. Two hundred miles from the coast, they fought a war with the natives in the turbulent ocean. As a result, they were captured from the ship by the natives. They stayed on the island for several weeks, where they lived with illegal thugs and Tahitian women. Although the purpose of filming was achieved, they escaped from the tiger's mouth on a passing ship on a dark night; but their lives were almost lost.</p>
<p>At this time, Monkeman's short film "The Great Barrier Reef" may be seen on the British screen. These reefs extend nearly a thousand miles along the coast of Queensland, parallel on both sides by man-eating sharks. If you wear Wellington boots and step onto the coral island, you will find many strange things. A sea snake pounces on you, and you will naturally jump elsewhere, but perhaps this jump will step on a stonefish. Good heavens! You can no longer tell whether it is an animal or a stone, but its sharp spines have already pierced into your foot. If you are a native from a trepang fishing boat, you are sure to die, but if you are a white man, it doesn't matter, because you are wearing boots!</p>
<p>In addition to this, there are many other rare and wonderful things that can be used as material for future Australian films. The difficulty now lies in the problem of talent. The role now needed is to be young and romantic. Mr. Serling has already discovered two, one is Leif Hicks, and the other is Cecil Scott. Although there are many other film talents, they have all gone to Elstree or Hollywood to test their fate.</p>
<p>In the next twelve months, more local actors may be seen to have an opportunity to develop; but for the time being, there is still a lack of talent. Snowy Scene Company will proceed with the production of "The Silence of Dean Maitland" and also prepare to go to England to find a star to play the leading role in Australia. Therefore, they should not only have a great organization for film companies; but also have to find ways to cultivate film talents. This is the current situation of the Australian film industry, which is quite an improvement compared to the past. (The End)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e283">Review of (Hot Pepper) <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The plot is lively, the meaning is superficial</p>
<p>Both the direction and performance are worth seeing</p>
<p>Generally, people who are often close to American movies will know that American movies at present cannot escape the trap of "sensuality" or "glamour." Thus, this kind of picture full of golden colors has indeed become an intoxicating entertainment weapon for the owners of material civilization. If we still hope to obtain some works of great value in addition to this substance, of course, this will inevitably disappoint us.</p>
<p>Sure enough, American filmmakers are still trying their best to circle in this narrow range. However, in order to avoid complete similarity in each film, the directors or screenwriters have to change the plot of the film, and the entire content is, of course, consistent with other works. Regarding this point, we can see it in "Hot Pepper."</p>
<p>So, what is in Hot Pepper? There are hot girls, violent gentlemen, indulgent songs and dances, naked shivers, large amounts of drinking, and extravagant gambling. Fraud and intimidation to obtain wealth, selling smuggled goods to get rich, all of this is the reality of the upper class, but it is also an exposure of their sins. Of course, we cannot say that such content is meaningless, but it is obviously just an exposure.</p>
<p>In this film, there is a lively plot, from beginning to end, there is no dullness at all. Here, we can clearly know the efforts of director John Blystone. However, after watching this film, we cannot be stimulated in the slightest, so it cannot give us any deep impression. Of course, this is because it is limited to the form of comedy, but if the content can be more</p>
<p>Can be enriched, it can still affect the audience, right?</p>
<p>Several major actors who have already become famous, of course, are still no less than their past achievements. However, if Victor McLaglen's actions are monotonous, it will not be able to gain the full favor of the audience. The performance of Lupe Velez, who plays the hot girl Pepper, is indeed very vivid. Although her wild exposure is inevitably exaggerated, she fully develops the personality of the character in the play and gives the film a special color.</p>
<p>In short, in this film, we can see the characteristics of capitalist movies, and this is the phenomenon that should occur in the process of collapse.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e284">The Characteristics of Jin Henry's "State Fair" <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Ke</p>
<p>Jin Henry's "State Fair" is indeed a very lively and interesting film: one scene after another unfolds the plot, and one scene after another reflects the delicate and flexible vivid interest. The characters in the play, such as Janet Gaynor as the beautiful farm girl, Will Rogers as the cautious rich farmer, Sally Eilers as the affectionate actress, Lew Ayres as the young newspaper reporter, Lois Trancy as the rich farmer's wife, Norman Foster as the unwilling farm boy, all performed as very appropriate supporting roles.</p>
<p>The structure of this film takes an idyllic American rural life as its prelude; the annual state fair, which is now translated as the State Fair, is the backbone. People from cities and villages in each state come to participate in this State Fair, so there is naturally an opportunity to give birth to many interesting things. Finally, this film returns to the original rural family as its epilogue, but the ending scene of this film must give the beautiful farm girl and the young newspaper reporter a happy ending in a romantic story that happened at the State Fair.</p>
<p>Jin Henry's most successful point is being vivid, flexible in being vivid, and being interesting, in being different. This film can be said to be vivid and interesting in every scene, and its vivid interest comes from indirect and very natural sources. The most characteristic example is when the judges at the State Fair are judging, everyone is holding their breath and waiting for the results of the judgment. It should be as dull as death and not vivid. However, everyone is constantly shaking a fan together, and each person's fan is different in various ways. In this way, on the one hand, the heat of autumn at the time of the State Fair gathering is described, and on the other hand, this scene is made vivid. Furthermore, when the farm girl and the newspaper reporter are in love for the first time, and even later when they are whispering sweet words, they are all set off by a speeding car, which makes the quiet love process vivid and draws the color picture of the State Fair. The rest are like the night when the farm boy and the actress have a tryst and say goodbye. We can vaguely see a bed, and clearly hear the voices of the farm boy and the actress whispering sweet words. For several minutes, there is no one's movement, but there is the constant change of light and the leisurely floating of the gauze window blown by the breeze. Here it is vivid. Finally, when the newspaper reporter and the farm girl reunite after a farewell, it is raining heavily all day long. The two hug and kiss each other in the rustling rain, and the large advertising board of the State Fair along the road is used as the background. The raindrops wet the advertising paper, followed by the shattered fall of the few big characters of the State Fair on the advertising board, and this "State Fair" film also closed. How vivid! What flexible wrists!</p>
<p>The jokes in this film, some are borrowed from actions, and some are borrowed from words, and there are not a few of them. A white pig is angry because of love, and withers because it does not see the red sow; the rich farmer is wholeheartedly guarding the piglets; and when judging the piglets, the music team is playing loudly, and the three strangely shaped judges are solemnly introducing them;—this is a joke with satire. After the seven-day period of the State Fair is over, everyone packs up their boxes, dismantles the sheds, and the cars slowly start to move, and a desolate scene of the end of the grand event is vividly in sight—this is the sorrow after the excitement.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Lyceum will have a grand event <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Zhi</p>
<p>Twelve people, including Edgar Wallace, a world-renowned drama expert, will appear on stage at the Lyceum Theatre in Shanghai to meet with the people of Shanghai. It is said that the date is set for May 9th to 13th, a total of five days, and the play to be performed is "The Case of the Frightened Lady," a script written by Edgar himself, and it is also the whole cast's best play.</p>
<p>Edgar's reputation has shaken Europe and the United States. The scripts he wrote have the style of Shakespeare. The plays he made are sung throughout the literary world, but he rarely appears on stage in person. This time he came to Shanghai for a tour, and the owner of Lyceum specially invited him to perform on stage. Edgar was very interested, so he agreed to perform for five days. It is expected that the traffic will be heavy on Maersilu Road, and there will be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e286">YMCA opens scientific and educational activity films <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>

<h3 id="e287">The Cold-Faced Man Marries a Nurse <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Guang Yi</p>
<p>Pace Carten, the famous cold-faced comedian on the screen, divorced his wife, Nerita Wen (cousin of Numen Taven, who played Camille). Requested a divorce in California. However, California must wait until August of this year to end the case. Carten couldn't bear it, so he went to Mexico and married his new lover, Ms. Mei, first. Ms. Mei was originally a hospital nurse. Carten was hospitalized due to illness, and then love happened.</p>
<h3 id="e288">Ai Xia's "Madam's Own Story" <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— You You</p>
<p>In the domestic film industry, Ai Xia's history is not long. Now her status is still below others, but in China's team of stars who mostly cannot write, she can actually write her own script, which is quite something to be proud of.</p>
<p>The script of "A Modern Woman" describes a modern lady whose thinking is very free and very thorough; but she can't escape the love barrier and falls in love with a newspaper reporter who is already married. She said to him, "I know you are married, you love your wife very much; but I don't care, I just ask if you love me." In this way, she loves him with all her heart and soul. Later, he lost his job, and because she wanted to help him, she stole a check from a fat merchant who was often pursuing her, and was imprisoned. This was her hard work, but who knew that the newspaper reporter would not understand her behavior. At that time, it happened that she had a friend in prison with her. She was persuaded by her friend and realized her mistake. When she was released from prison, she became a brand new revolutionary woman.—The director of this film is Mr. Li Pingqian, and the protagonist is Ai Xia herself.</p>
<p>After "A Modern Woman" was written, everyone said that it was Ai Xia's autobiography, because she often advocated that love should be thorough. We dare not decide whether it is "Madam's Own Story"; but "words are the voice of the heart", there must be some of her thoughts inside, right?</p>
<h3 id="e289">Hollywood Star Claws <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— A Lin</p>
<p>Liliane Hawe, the petite, lively, and innocent singer and dancer in "Dragon Soaring Phoenix Dance," has been silent for a long time since she was recruited by Fox Company. Now she is co-starring with John Boles in "My Lips Betray." One has a melodious voice, and the other has a loud golden voice. Their cooperation is a perfect match! And this is also Ms. Hawe's post-remarriage debut!</p>
<p>George Raft, the second Valentino, is now a big star worshiped by women, so he is very dissatisfied with his salary of 750 yuan per week and has asked Paramount to increase his salary to 2,500 yuan, otherwise he would rather not do it and go to Europe. But the company has not necessarily agreed.</p>
<p>Janet Gaynor and her new screen partner, French star Henri Garat's collaboration "Adorable" is already in production, but her contract with Fox will expire in June, and many companies are willing to pay her a salary greater than 2,500 yuan, but she may not want to leave her place of origin, Fox!</p>

<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>Dance leader Lee Andy deliberately pretended not to be embarrassed and talked to Ma Bu sideways. Pierre hurriedly jumped from the sound cotton team seat to Ma Xi's side.</p>
<p>"You don't have to wait, Mr. Ma Xi," Pierre interjected. "It just so happens that there is a girl here. And she is also a top dancer. I have been watching her all day. You have also seen her twice, but she was eliminated the third time."</p>
<p>When Andy led Pan Qi to the front of the stage, she was still half asleep, but Ma Xi's voice woke her up.</p>
<p>"She can do it," Ma Xi said after looking at her.</p>
<p>When Ma Xi was sitting alone in the room, Jones came.</p>
<p>"You naturally know that Abner Dillon is making trouble in the troupe," Jones said sternly. "Hey, what she likes about this troupe is Toresai Buick. He is afraid that he will withdraw his shares."</p>
<p>"Why?" Ma Xi replied hesitantly.</p>
<p>"Why, because Miss Buick is double-dealing right in front of him."</p>
<p>"With whom?" Ma Xi asked, showing concern for the first time.</p>
<p>"With a playmate from her playground. Now that she has come here to start another class, he has followed her. If Dillon finds out about this, he will definitely not do it, and then it will be terrible."</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" Jones asked suspiciously when Ma Xi reached out to make a phone call.</p>
<p>"I'm going to discuss it with my friend Mo Fei," Ma Xi replied. "He never likes playgrounds."</p>
<p>"Is it Shi Limo Fei?" Jones retorted. "You can't, Qiu Lin. Listen. I don't want to associate with gangsters like Mo Fei."</p>
<p>"Can't I?" Ma Xi retorted. "If anyone wants to destroy my dance troupe, I can't talk about what means to use to deal with them."</p>
<p>When Ma Xi was discussing with Mo Fei, Toresai and Pan Te were sitting side by side on a bench in Central Park Lake, entangled in love. Such an appointment was their only opportunity to express their love to each other.</p>
<p>Pan Te's arm was tightly around her, her head resting on her shoulder, and Toresai was completely intoxicated in the quick rush. But Pan Te was pondering.</p>
<p>"Let's not be children anymore, Tao," he said. "Your future is great. I always limit you, like hooking your neck. When people don't see me, I can only see you doing this secretly, which makes it difficult for me to be a human being. It doesn't sound good for a man to not do anything and take money from a woman, Tao."</p>
<p>"But my current position is entirely given to me by you, Pan." Toresai protested. "It was you who created my singing and dancing art. You trained me, guided me, told me everything, I have not forgotten." (To be continued)</p>
