<p>華北之緊張局面。自塘沽愶定，成立以迄於大連會議其間經過若干交涉。</p>
<p>若干波折。始有接收灤東之實現。今者豐瀾唐山玉田灤縣等。已由我國縣長公安局長前往接收。同時灤東五縣如昌黎臨榆撫寗遷安盧龍。亦皆將重見靑天白日之旗幟。自此中日間似可進入於平時狀態。而半年來足以挑動世界戰禍之嚴重性。亦將由此消滅矣。然而吾人觀察事實。尙不勝其憂欋當灤東未接收前。吾人即感覺日軍久駐不撤。我方終難行使政權。且又僞軍雜處。一方受日軍指使一方假民族自决之美名。以掣中國之肘。此爲吾人所深慮者。今者灤東雖已次第接收而日軍則並</p>
<p>辛丑條約駐兵北寗線。甚至印就文件迫我縣長公安局長。凡有佈告。須申報日軍司令部。是不啻我國官吏。須受日軍支配有碍我國政權之完整甚大。再</p>
<p>就僞滿方面觀之。日軍復借口於滿洲傀儡國之安全。張布彼所謂國防第一就僞滿方面觀之。日軍復借口於満洲傀儡國之安全張布彼所謂國防第一線在甲午淸日戰爭前。彼以高麗爲第一線及至朝鮮亡後其國防線遂由朝</p>
<p>鮮而擴大至於滿洲。今者又。由満洲而擴大至於熱河至於内蒙其國防線愈逼愈近。非欲實施其大陸政策而何此爲吾人痛感不安者一也。</p>
<p>日軍閥在未强佔東三省以前視東三省爲其禁臠旣佔我東三省野野心更　　熾。竟視我全國爲其禁臠故我國與國聯商榷技術上之合作。而即屢發其恐嚇之言。盡力以國壤。聞美軍艦富爾頓號運軍用品厦門起岸之説。則又揑造其所謂福建建省之密約。更張大其詞謂美將在東山灣確保其海軍根據地是。皆足以表示其侵略之野心。而爲視我全國爲其禁臠之實證。使吾人痛</p>
<p>感不安者二也。</p>
<p>彼日軍閱所以懷如此奢望者。初以月滿洲入彼囊　而後。即足以我解决其國内政治之困難。克服經濟恐慌之矛盾。乃不不料一年半以還。並未能如其所願且歐美各强國。莫不急急於殖民地及半殖民地經濟上之培養。尤一致注目於遠東之市塲若英若美若法德。在中國皆具相當深長之歷史關係。英國之於長江流域自商工業以至金融。莫不有特殊關聯。美國開拓東方之念。亦迄未稍已。以金錢輔助其經濟上勢力之發展。即其在華地位可特别增高。英美在長江流域市塲之勢力長。即日本在長江流域之勢力消。此爲日本當局所深懼。又見世界經濟會議停會而後。國際合作之說。暫無實現可能勿論英美。均將竭其全力以從事於舊有範圍内之經濟盟。以穩固其國内市塲。决不肯以兵力輔助海外之開拓。輕啓其二次之大戰。我國一時又無實力以制止其武力之侵略。故對國聯與美。先大肆其惡意之宣傳。繼加以種種之恐嚇。意若謂列國如下聽日本之勸告者。彼將以兵力破毁此市塲。鳴呼。彼平日所標榜維護世界和平之面目何在也。</p>
<p>回憶滿洲問題在日内瓦會議爭執時美前總統曾謂惟能以武裝自衛者始可確保和平。以諷示我急起自衛。不可依賴他人今美國陸軍總長又謂時時凖備適當防衛。爲和平最大保障。目下急急於擴充海陸軍即爲實行斯言之表示。而其他若英若法若蘇聯等。亦莫不力求充實軍備至於日本爲欲防制他人之武裝侵略更欲以武裝侵略人故其整飭軍力較他國爲尤急是武裝保障和闰一語。已成今日通行之鐵律。質言之即以武裝相爭競而已我國處此武裝包圍之情勢下。而不亟謀武裝自衛則國將危旣不能以武裝自衛。而更不能全國團結一致。堅强其组織力。共同以經濟自衛則國必亡現今灤東雖已接收。而瞻顧前途。憂患正多。欲求所以免此憂患武裝自衛歟經濟自衛歟二者俱無癇途尙堪問乎。</p>

<p>國民二十七日維也納電奥國京城對於此次匈牙利總理龔波士之赴意、極爲注意、據維也納日報今所載某「特别外交通訊員」之報告、此次龔波士與意首相墨索重尼之談話、已一再指示意大利確已成爲前目前中歐政治之中心點、而此次關於多瑙河流域政治經濟狀况之整理、意大利實爲開始工作之發起者云、該記載復進而討論外傳法俄間軍事密約之事、該通訊員稱、甚望法國勿以爲關乎手無寸鐵之德國之種種無稽恐懼、而與布爾札維克主義携手、倘法國以歐洲軍備最盛之國家、貿然與全歐社會經濟組織公敵之蘇俄聯絡、則法國將鑄成不可限量之政治錯誤、蓋此約之成立、蒙其利者僅蘇俄一國而已、故法俄之軍事密約一果爲事實者、是不啻歐洲自殺之行爲云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十八日維也納電奥國與匈牙利經濟携手之說似已有進展、奥國勞工部長史杜默、向「匈牙利通訊」宣稱、渠贊成匈奥經濟携手、蓋並非關稅同盟、而兩國農業及工業之資源、可以互相利用云云、</p>

<h3 id="c252">測算電綫的簡法 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>欲繞線圈或製方棚，在未動手之前，第一步要决定的，是用何號電線？其每時之圈數，每磅之長度，以及負載安全電流各若干？假如有電綫表在手，則一查即得；但倘無電綫表在手，翻尋線表，或請敎於人，煞費麻煩。現在一有很容易明瞭，很容易記憶的測算電線的簡便方法，照此而行，算出的結果與電線表上的數値，相差微幾，今將此法詳述於下。</p>
<p>量電線的表，在現世界上都採用美國標準量線規表，其英文縮寫爲Ｂ·＆Ｓ·Ｃ·這表上載明電線的號數，直徑，橫截面積，每時之圈數，每磅之長度，以及負載之安全電流，以供檢查，便於應用。現在用這簡便的測算法，都能算出牠所列的各項。茲分别言之。</p>
<p>㈠求線號</p>
<p>該線規表的號數計自一至四十五號止，一號之上，尙有四號，以一個零字，二個零字等區别之。此線規表内各號線的橫截面積，常有一定遞增數。每大三號，其橫截面積增大二倍；若小三號，則减低一半。每大十號，則增大十倍；若小十號，則减低十分之一倍。例如該線規表之二十號線。橫截面積爲ro22圓密耳（ＣircularＭils一密耳等於千分之一時）所以十七號爲ro22Ｘ×2＝2044圓密耳；二十三號爲io22Ｘ×·5＝5ii圓密耳，故知其橫截面積數就能知其號數。　　例：有一電線，其橫截面積爲50圓密耳，問此線號數。</p>
<p>解：因知三十號線，其橫截面積爲roo圓密耳，故50÷100＝·５决定其爲三十三號。</p>
<p>㈡求直徑</p>
<p>將橫截面積數開平方，其平方根數即爲直徑之數値：因橫截面積數就是直徑自乘之積數。</p>
<p>例：有某號電線，橫截面積爲１０２２圓密耳，問此綫直徑若干？</p>
<p>解：Ｖ１０２２＝３２密耳（未完）</p>

<p>此磁感作用，力謀所以避之。其法以用隔離罩爲最有效。其他部分且不論，今僅就绕圈所用之隔離罩來研究一下，罩須用良導片製成，以鋁片　銅片爲佳，其形式及罩與線圈，距離尺寸，應如下Ａ爲隔離罩（Ｓhield）Ｅ爲金屬底板</p>
<p>Ｄ爲Ｌ式金屬</p>
<p>Ｃ爲線圈與罩</p>

<h3 id="c254">電阻的量法 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 琦</p>
<p>以前本刋中「高電阻的自製」一篇，</p>
<p>閱者大槪多記得，不過要確定牠的阻力，就非用儀嚴不可，倘是阻力甚高，則通過的電流</p>
<p>也很小，照</p>
<p>普通的量法</p>
<p>（如第一圖）</p>
<p>則不能正確</p>
<p>，且欲所量</p>
<p>之電阻，其</p>
<p>阻力亦受其</p>
<p>限制，超出</p>
<p>範圍，則不</p>
<p>能量得確實</p>
<p>的阻力。</p>
<p>但照下</p>
<p>述的方法則</p>
<p>可小至幾歐</p>
<p>姆及大至數</p>
<p>十萬亦無不可：如第一圖爲普通的量法，ＡＢ是接線頭，Ｅ是電池，其電壓不必一個半伏脫，或可較高，再一隻。丨1ＭＡ安培表，或。丨10ＭＡ者亦可，但前者比較正確，Ｒ是所求之電阻；而依歐姆定律Ｒ＝Ｅ-1則Ｒ至少Ｒx＝　15-0·001＝以上，否則通過之電流已出該安培表之範圍，因此也不能求出其阻力矣。若是在上述線路裏加進一個可變電阻（第二圖）使ＡＢ兩頭短路，同時調節可變電阻Ｒ，至表上恰指出最大電流，然後將ＡＢ分離，這樣就可以量一百歐姆以上的電阻；即Ｒ×＝Ｅ－１－Ｒ，若所求的電阻極高，則可將電池Ｅ加高電壓；但Ｒ之阻力亦須更改，如Ｅ在一個半伏脫時則Ｒ約須Ｒ＝Ｅ·001-r,5</p>
<p>00　。</p>
<p>第三圖是量一百歐姆以下用的，Ｒ的作用與上述的相同，但這時ＡＢ兩頭並不短路，而使表上指出最大電流，此時將Ｒ　接入，即可用下式算出其阻力，</p>
<p>Ｒx＝Ｒm-n-i</p>
<p>Ｒm是電表的阻力，如上述之電表，大槪在三十歐姆左右。</p>
<p>n是表上之最大電流與表上指出之電流</p>
<p>之比。</p>
<p>例如：</p>
<p>Ｒm＝30</p>
<p>表上指示電流＝0，75ＭＡ</p>
<p>則Ｒ　　　＝　　　（約）</p>

<p>— 振之</p>
<p>在交流收音機，有時若將電源插頭反插，往往可以增進收音的能力，那是很奇怪的，在交流電路的兩端，雖然正負按時互易，可是插頭的插法却有一定，往往這樣插是對的，那樣插就不對了。電流從某一方向流入你的收音機，可以比從另一方向流入的成績好些，將插頭反覆換插，就可以試得這一個成績較好的電流方向。</p>
<p>試把你的電源插頭反覆安插數次，必能試得一種成績較好的插法。當你試得了以後，就在插頭和插座上相對地各作一個記號，如到了一條小槽，再在這小槽中塗上一些白粉，這條樣，在改變插頭的位置時，就易於鑑别了。</p>

<p>— 鍾世性</p>
<p>蓄電池可分鉛蓄電池及　鐵電池二種·鉛蓄電池的電壓比　鐵電池高，所以銅蓄電池的用途較爲普遍。二者價値都是很貴，我們如果保護及使用得法，能夠用多年不壞的。</p>
<p>蓄電池在電流充足的時候，電壓較高，用了若干時之後，漸漸降落，銅蓄電流新的電流充足時、電壓爲　弗打，用了若干時之後，爲　弗至　　弗打便不好再，鎳鐵電池充滿的時候爲　弗打，到了一弗打之時，就不好再用，必須充電了。</p>
<p>我們無線電所用的電壓較高，是多數連接而成的，蓄電池上紅色或㈩經騐是陽極的記號，黑色或㈠是陰極的記號。我們要較高的電壓，將每個陽極各自連接，電壓的高低　蓄電池的多少有一定的比例。</p>
<p>蓄電池電量單们呌做安時，是安培</p>
<p>和時間的乘積，無線電所用的大多六十安時。</p>
<p>我們用至上述規定的電壓，必須要充電。但是無論用與不用，最好在一定時期充電一次，如其不用時間在五六月之上，就要將裏面的藥液倒出，用淸水洗得十分淸潔，把那藥液收藏起來，等到要用的時候，再把他放入裏面，這樣可以永久保存不壞。</p>
<p>在新的蓄電池最初一次充電，甚覺費事，時間亦比較長些，最好將正負極對換，充了幾次以後，就須固定，不得再換。我們如果托專門充電家代充幾次，以後自己就容易了。</p>
<p>在充電時覺得電液發現白色的沸騰泡沬，就是將達充足的現象，如果熱度在華氏一百度之上，就不宜再充。等到冷時再充。液體比重計或電壓表察量，所充的電壓，銅蓄電池到一·三○○，電壓在二·六伏脫至二·八付脫的時候，鎳鐵電池在一·二○○，電壓在一·五的時候就要停止充電了。</p>
<p>在平常的時候，蓄電池上面要抺擦淸潔，不要擺在潮濕的地方，最好在蓋上塗些凡士林，在外面另裝一只盒子套着則不至廛垢堆積，濕氣浸入，而使電流消失，以及藥液蒸發汚及衣物等等。　　蓄電池内的藥液，要浸遇銅片之上，如有乾燥，可加入蒸溜水，不可任意亂加藥液，及不淸潔的水。如果能照法使用，必定能夠收良好的效果。</p>

<p>（十一）收音機之一般構造</p>
<p>近年來因廣播無綫電之發達，收音機種類之多，不勝枚舉，然觀其一般構造，則不外乎下列數種而已。</p>
<p>㈠天綫電路：由廣播無綫電台所發射之電波，每秒間約以三○○○○○基羅米突的速度傳播於四方，以此速度當可　繞全地球之七回半而有餘。如在電波所進行之途中裝設一接收用天綫，則電波必被此天綫所吸收，而變成一每秒百五十萬週以上之振盪電流，往還流通於天地綫路間，此種電流因週率極高，俗稱高電流，或稱射電週率電流。</p>
<p>㈡配諧電路（ＴuningＣircuit）：配諧電路爲收音機之門</p>
<p>戶，係由自感量綫圈與電容器而成。變換綫圈中之自感量與電各器之電容量，將該電路之自身週率（ＮaturalＦrequency）</p>
<p>增减，使與外來所欲接收之射電符週率相合。換言之，配諧電路係用擇選以外來電波者，其製造之優劣足以影響收音機之選擇性與其靈敏度。</p>
<p>㈢射電週率放大電路：由廣播電台所發射之電波每因距離之關係或其他種種原因，以致其强席過弱，往往非經放大則不能運用。射電週率放大電路乃在配諧電路與檢波電路之間，用以擴大射電週率電流者。</p>
<p>㈣檢波電路：檢波電路具有一檢波器以司整流作用，將射電週率電流變成週率較低之成音週率電流。</p>
<p>㈤成音週率放大電路：該電路位於檢波電路之後，以擴大成音週率電流者。　　㈥輸出電路：在輸出電路將成音週率電流變成音響，擴聲嚴與輸出交連裝置等均屬該電路。</p>
<p>㈦電源電路：電源路供給電力於收音機。如在直流收音機，則其所需電源爲乾電池或蓄電池，如在交流收音機，則電源係利用電燈線之交流電源。</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>㈢呂后第二的楊黃氏</p>
<p>偵緝組長陳植雲，特派幹練偵緝，在楊公館對門租了一所小屋居住，以便明查暗訪，經一月之久；但是，傳說不一，有說「陳氏潛逃，」有說：「陳氏被害，」都是捕風捉影，毫無把握的談論。誰知一月以後，楊氏便秘密遷居了；只爲少修自知此事不了，若長往此屋，終有發覺日子，不如遷地爲良。楊氏遷家以後，偵緝又在楊姓的新居左右，賃屋住下，漸漸　悉楊氏的傭婦，婢女，都是服務已久，所有慘案發行，一定瞞不遇若輩的耳目，此中線索，須在若輩口　抽出，但不能加以逮捕，免得打草驚蛇，使那兇犯潛逃。</p>
<p>市塲旁邊歇着一輛汽車，楊公館的傭婦正往市塲購　，便有人拉伊上車，駛往公安局中，把楊氏拘押以後，汽車　往原處停歇　楊公館中久候備婦不回，又還婢女往菜市尋覓，又被偵緝隊賺上汽車，拘往局中管押。陳組長植雲再三審問，傭婦婢女堅說不知。陳植雲各交伊們三百塊錢，君令：「說破案情以後，便可取了這筆錢回去養家，家不必再在楊公館傭工度日，儘可直說，何用顧忌？」這三百塊的效力眞大，伊們便老實不客氣的，把妬婦殺妾滅屍的慘案，一一在公安局供招了：</p>
<p>原來，陳氏被黃氏賺放虎穴以後，其初，口角了兩三句，黃氏便用雙手緊扼陳氏咽喉，便其氣閉以死，陳氏努力撑拒，竟將黃氏的大指食指交　處咬住。旋由「舅爺動務兵」帮助，黃氏得脫，伊竟仗着大刀一柄，向陳氏奮命亂砍，陳氏死後，裂屍作數十段，置　中煮爛，然後逐一秘移出戶外，棄往荒郊，以飽犬腹。俗稱「最毒婦人心」，便指首黃氏　一般婦人而言。從前呂后斷戚夫人手足，使爲人最，黃氏的慘酷手段，可稱呂后第。</p>
<p>現在，案情已大白了，兇犯已被逮了，牆壁上已騐出血跡了，黃氏的手又，還留着齒痕兩處，尤其不可抵賴了。寫到這　，我要把這件案情，請一般喜納偏房的政界紅人物看看，又要呌醉心虚榮喜做官太的女學生看看，看了以後究竟作什麽感想？</p>

<p>— 趙圭</p>
<p>女人在春情發動期以後，因了生理的關係，乳房便會漸漸的高聳起來，這本是一種天然美。可是伊們不知爲了甚麽，偏要想消滅它，緊緊的小背心，將胸部束得像鐵板也似的平坦。豈知這種惡習，眞無異是一種自殺政策。　　不能自由呼吸因之而造成肺癆病；以及乳房受壓迫太甚，而患乳房結核，這種種，便都是束胸的厚賜。</p>
<p>並且，這種惡習於民族的健康也有很大的關係，因爲乳房受了重大的壓迫，乳頭便微小，或者凹入乳腺，不能盡量發育，將來有了小孩，便不龍有優良的乳汁，而使孩子們没有優良的母乳，當然地，體格便不能健全了。</p>
<p>束胸對於國家的和個人的害處，是這樣的明顯，女人們，爲甚不加以根本的改革呢？</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>朱紅的嘴唇，蓬鬆的髮，一雙高跟鞋，走起路來，各登各登的響得那樣的醉人心肝。這樣便是一個十足的摩登人物。</p>
<p>登的高跟鞋，在歐美，早已不摩登，實在的，這也是一樣有害身體的東西。在生理方面說：神經易受感獨和激剌，精神容易疲勞，且兩脚容易變形而生厚皮或硬結，有時子宮的位置會因此而前傾或前屈，造成月經困難或月經痛的原因。况且在跌倒的時候，也容易受傷，便是走路，恐怕也没有中國平底鞋舒服吧。</p>

<h3 id="c265">冰凍時的松花江 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 妙神</p>
<p>當這火傘高張，汗如雨的時候，讓我來談一些松花江冰凍時的情形，或者可能當讀者諸君的一杯冰淇淋吧？</p>
<p>前幾年我在松花江旁的哈爾濱，那時哈爾濱雖屬關外，但總歸還飄　中國的國旗；現在呢，時過境遷，已淪爲異邦，眞今非昔比了。</p>
<p>哈爾濱的氣候，非常寒冷，每到中秋左右，快將穿皮衣了。哈爾濱水陸交通</p>
<p>，本是一個東三省極大的通商口岸，到了寒天，松花江冰凍了，那時船隻雖不能通行，但堅冰之上，平添了不少冰車，這種車子，即北方所稱的大車，可載重千餘斤，以馬一匹或二匹拉之。車在冰上行走，因冰滑，速度反而比在岸上快，這種車子常從哈爾濱溯江而上，或從别地拉來，一天可行一二百里路。因江面上氣候的嚴寒，車夫都穿了極厚的老羊皮襖，皮帽皮手套，這種皮帽皮手套毛很長，狀頗粗野，但却非常暖熱。　　冰面上還有一種人坐的「冰排」，又呌「撬子」，這種東西構造很簡單，以一塊板擱在二片如刀一般的鐵片上，鐵片與冰的磨擦力極小，人坐在板上，一人以竹桿橫袴下觸冰，「冰排」即前進如飛，惟因行動太速，反覺駕御不易，故有時常會發生危險的事。</p>
<p>江南封凍之後，冰面上天然有幾個氣洞，這氣洞是給冰底的游魚吸氣的，這也可見上帝造物之至意。漁夫利用這點，就把魚網在洞中埀釣，大魚小魚，一齊都來，比江面没有封凍時，反覺省力，這也一般人所意想不到的。</p>

<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>凡物遇熱則漲，遇冷則縮，中國的土地，因爲五分鐘熱度的朋友太多，荷蘭水，冰忌淋，在這夏天裏邊，終日的向肚子裏裝進，血喝凉了！國土僅可緊縮，與他們是漠不相關。</p>
<p>中國的水因爲根據女人是水做的，大都市裏的時髦婦女委實太多，水的成分，也就一年比較一年來得增加，廣泛，造成百年未見的新紀錄。</p>
<p>本年份各地大水，在最緊張的時候，接近危險地帶的人民，人人均將二十年大水的夢境，重複着回憶在腦蒂裏，結果，成災的成災，潰堤的潰堤，水在我們國内與國土比較，一方面是膨脹，一方面是緊縮，造成一種矛盾的，不可思議的反比例。</p>
<p>水在某處告旱荒的時候，弄得赤地千里，醴泉無滴，在某處告水災的時候，弄得陸地行舟，巨浪滔天，這種畸形的發展，人民所受的危險，飢餓，痛苦，也就像記水的水標一樣，一天比一天的向上加高。</p>
<p>水在舊式的老太婆看起來，不過洗洗衣服，燒茶喝，和在米裏　飯吃，業於其他，却没有感情的衝動，農人對於水却就不同，是很重視的，稻田裏没有水，就車水灌漑，雨落了滿堤，眼見靑苗滅頂，就望雨水減退，水量的漲落，對於農人的利害，是很有密切的關係的。　　女人是水做的，大都市裏的時髦婦女委實大多，水的產量在近幾年來，也就來得廣泛，增加，造成百數十年來未有的新紀錄，照這樣看法，水的滋味，委實是酸的，是苦澀的，是震盪得人的心靈不能動彈的，冲刷，盪激，巨浪滔天、毁壞房屋，這種况味令我們人類承受着，眞是夠消受了！</p>

<p>第十一回　　寒賤苦從戎病夫落伍</p>
<p>犧牲甘解甲戰士多情</p>
<p>對於這些弟兄們，要談什麽高超的思想，當然是不必，這就向大家道：我這兩個禮拜告訴你們的話，你們都得記着。我們總司令來檢閱我們的軍隊，若是我們能考個第一，這可大大的有面子。將來總呆令賞下來·····趙自强提起全副精神來說話，打算把身上這一股子冷氣，可以去掉就在這個時候，却看到隊伍裏，有個兵士，臉上變了色，抗了一桿槍，只管有些東歪西倒。便呌道：盛世民你怎麽了。盛世民不敢答話，立刻挺了胸脯子，將槍抗直。但是他這種强自支持的辦法，究竟不能持久，不到幾分鐘工夫，他的身子又輕蕩起來了。趙自强看他那樣子，知道他身上有了病，正想問明了情由，呌他先下去，那兵士已是等待不得，連槍和人，身子向前一栽，滾倒在地上。趙自强看了人家這樣子，當然是不能再加責駡，呌兩個兵士，先把他搭回連部去。這兩名兵將他搭到了寢室裏，就問道：你是怎麽了？盛世民哼道：褲襠裏又癢又痛，簡直是要了命。</p>
<p>一個兵道：哈！這是繡球風，是咱們當大兵的人專有的病。他媽的，被服廠的人，偷工減料，只顧自己發財，把這樣廠包似的棉襖，給當大兵的穿。說着，用手摸摸褲擋道：你瞧，冷風鑽進去了，就是繡球風。這個症疾，可不大好治。你和連長商量商量，想法子在營長那兒請病假出去。你千萬可别上軍醫處那兒治病，我是知道的，你是内科，給你一點苦硫吃吃，你是外科，給你塗點凡士林，好藥是有，犯不上給當兵的治病，人家還可以拿去賣錢呢？反正打扣頭賣給幹這行的，還怕没人要呀。病治不好，你死了是活該，有人報上燒埋費去，還可以沾點光呢。（一四二）</p>

<p>— 旅隼</p>
<p>這幾天，聽潯社出了一本「食肉者言」，是現在　的在朝者，先前還是在野時候的言論，結大家「聽其言而觀其行」，知道先後有怎樣的不同。那同社出版的週刋『　聲』裏，也常有同一意思的文字。</p>
<p>這是查舊賬，翻開賬簿，打起算盤，給一個結算，問前後不符，是怎麽的，確也是一種最切實分明，令人騰挪不得的辦法。然而，這辦法之在現在，可未免太『古道』了。</p>
<p>古人是怕查這種舊賬的，蜀的韋莊當窮困時，做過一篇慷慨激昻，文字較爲通俗的『秦婦今』，眞弄得大家傳誦，待到他顯達之後，却不但不肯編入集中，連人家的鈔本也想設法消滅了。當時不知何，但看淸朝末年，又從敦煌的山洞中掘出了這時的鈔本，就可見是白用機了的，然而那苦心却也還可以想見。</p>
<p>不過這是古之名人。常人就不同了，他要抺殺舊賬，必須砍下腦袋，再行投胎。斬犯帮赴法塲時，大呌道，『過了二十年，又是一條好漢！』爲了另起爐　，從新做人，非經過二十年不可，眞是麻煩得很。</p>
<p>不過這是古今之常人。今之名人就又不同了，他要抺殺舊賬，從新做人，比起常人的方法來，遲速眞有郵信和電報之别。不怕迂緩一點的，就出一回洋，造一個寺，生一塲病，游幾天山；要快，則開一次會，唸一卷經，演說一通，宣言一下，或者睡一夜覺，做一首詩也可以；要更快，那就自打兩個嘴巴，倘幾滴眼淚，照樣能夠另變一人，和『以前之我』絕無關係。凈壇將軍搖身一變，化爲鯽魚，在女妖們的大腿間鑽來去，作者或自以爲寫得出神入化，但從現在看來，是連新奇氣息也没有的。</p>
<p>如果這樣變法，還覺得麻煩，那就白一白眼，反問道：『這是我的賬？』如果還嫌麻煩，那就眼也不　白，問也不問，而現在所流行的，却大抵是後一法。</p>
<p>『古道』怎麽能再行於今之世呢？竟還有人主　張讀經，眞不知是什麽意思？然而過了一夜，說不定會主張大家去當兵的，所以我現在經也没有買，恐怕明天兵也未必當。</p>
<h3 id="c293">關於「豐災」的作品（續） <a href="#c293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— 鳳吾</p>
<p>爲葉紹鈞所忽略了的這「主要一環，」</p>
<p>在白薇的戲劇「豐災」中，是被很强調的描寫着。可是「豐災」和「多收了三五斗，」是一樣的存在着許多缺陷的。具體的說，第一，作者對於農村社會的機構，還没有很好的理解；因此，「貧」農的家庭裏可以有漂亮的都會女學生，商人要依靠農民做官廳經濟剝削的掩護，官吏對農民完全採取直接迫害的形式，豪紳竟没有勇氣和農民正面爲敵，農村破產的帝國主義關係只有輸米的一點。第二，作者很多的描寫是失却了眞實性，在人物方面，可以說，作者所描寫的，完全是穿了外衣的智識份子，特殊是『次子，』簡直是一個動搖的小資產階級的典型。第三，作者所描寫的故事，是浪漫諦克的。貧農的家庭裏有了都會的女學生，又還有做官的表兄，而表兄又是一面對女的進行戀管，一面進攻她的家庭；她的家庭破滅了，他又來進行戀愛。在社會組織的關係上，這樣的事實，是决不會存在的。所以白薇的這篇戲劇，她雖然有很好的企圖，雖然費了很大的精力，但由於認識的不夠，生活體騐的缺乏，是終不免於有若干失敗的地方。</p>
<p>比較起來，茅盾的「秋收，」是相當的成功的。把這一篇連緊着「春蠶，」「殘冬，」去看，至少是有三個特點可以指出。第一，是發展的描寫了農民的成長。從爲着「生」的努力到豐收的飢餓，從飢餓中的自覺到「吃大戶，」「搶米囤，」</p>
<p>從「吃大戶，」「搶米囤」到逐漸的組織化「繳槍械，」是逐一的描寫了它的過程。第二，是農村飢餓羣的匯合過程。在小說裏，他不但寫了農民意識的複雜性，而且寫了具有這樣複雜性的農民，如何在共同的飢餓壓迫下逐漸匯合起來。終至，就是極頑固的老通　，在臨斷氣的時候也不能不說：「眞想不到你（多多頭）是對的，眞奇怪！」第三是作者很有力的形象化了一切，而不機的去寫。藝術當然是形象化的東西，因爲很多的新的作家還不能這樣做，特强調的提出此點。如帝國主義對農村侵略的一面，他並不哲學式的，口號式的提出來，而在老通寳惡「洋」的一些事實上去寫，就是很好的一例。至於都會農村一樣的没有可逃避的路，祇有自己聯合起來爭取「新生，」當然也是重要的優點的一個。　　然而，我對於「秋收」的作者，在讀了「子夜」和這幾篇小說以後，終不能已於言，終不能没有更進一步的希望。就是，第一，作爲前進的代表作家的作者，還没有很好的從雜多的現實中，去尋出革命的契機，而把它描寫爲革命的主題，發揮主題的積極性，以完成其前進作家必然擔負起的任務。第二，是作者非辨證的超階級的純客觀主義的態度，是不斷的防害了作者，對於事件的更深入的理解，而產生走向機械的唯物論的前途的危機。這兩個問題，也就是一個認識的，觀察的方法的問題。作者如果能堅苦的學習辨證法唯物論，也祇有辨證法唯物論能克復純客觀主義以及主觀主義，我想，作者對於整個文學運動發展的推動力量將會十百倍於現在的。</p>

<p>— 埜容</p>
<p>阿大從門外走進來，向我點頭，就岸然的坐下去。老婆忙丢下小孩，起身倒了一鐘茶，一面打着笑臉送到桌上道：「大爺喝茶。」</p>
<p>我立刻明白他是爲什麽來的。我低下頭搓着貫笆的草繩，等他先開口。我不知道今天要怎樣纔能打發他出門。阿大是不容易說話的，他一臉橫肉。</p>
<p>他從桌上端起茶呷了一口，嘴唇抖顫了幾下，似乎給茶剌痛了似的，吃吃的開口了：</p>
<p>「和尙，我，我來，你，你是知道的，你那一，一百塊錢欠租，今天約明，明天，明天約約後天，倒底幾時纔，纔有？害我一趟兩趟的跑。」</p>
<p>我覺得無話可說。他每趟來，我把所有的好話都說光了，而且重重覆覆說得我自己也覺壓。并且一開口，他就將阻住我，說一這些話我都聽夠了，你，你只說，今，今天倒底有没有？」他的話，我也是聽夠了的。</p>
<p>「你爲什不，不響？」他開始生氣，捶着桌子。老婆驚慌了，小孩被響聲駭得哭起來。</p>
<p>「大爺！」我老婆哀怯的呌了他一聲，再也說不下去似乎是哀求他饒了我，又似求他不要敲桌子，把孩子驚了。　　「你，你不響，是不，不行的。老　說，今天没有，就呌我帶你，上，上保衛團去。」</p>
<p>上保衛團就上保衛團吧，我把心一橫，回他道：「今天委實没有。」</p>
<p>「没，没有，是罷？那好。你着就是。」他說着站起身來。老婆怕他要來揪我，忙起身立到我們的中間。但他揮揮手，兩步就踏出我的大門，走了。老婆帶着驚恐的眼光看我一眼，好像問，他會怎樣呢？</p>
<p>今天他走得這麽快，眞使我疑惑不定。我一面搓着快要搓完的草繩，心裏突突的跳。今天將發生什麽事呢？······</p>
<p>老婆不知道什麽時候把小孩丢在草窩裏走了。他忽然哇哇的哭起來。我呌了她一聲，不見回響，心裏發火，一跳起身，衝到後面去尋她。然而，没有。我到後門去張了一張，屋後的小河，正在汩汩的流着。風吹着柳梢，沙沙作響。一羣難從那邊驚驚慌慌的跑來，隔壁的三兒，握着一條鞭子，喘着氣，看見我就遠遠的立定，呌道：</p>
<p>「快去，快去，你家大嫂跳到河裏去了。」</p>
<p>我心裏一慌，兩腿發軟，但拖着兩條沉重的腿，跟着三兒跑，人已經聚滿在港口的岸了。我看見有人把她從水中拉上來，一身透濕的衣，緊緊的裏在　她身上，頭向後倒埀着。</p>
<p>完了，完了！我來不及趕到，就覺胸口有一團什麽，硬得作痛。我走上去一看，唉，她合着眼，肚皮被水脹滿了，躺在地上，我聽見有人說：「斷了氣了，時光太久。」</p>
<p>我的胸口就好像暴裂了似的，把口一張，吐了出來。耳邊有人喊：血！</p>
<p>我倒在地上。······</p>
<p>我隱約中看見阿大滿臉橫肉的站在人堆裏。我怒聲呌道：「這是血債！」</p>
<h3 id="c295">平凡的事（二六） <a href="#c295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>

<p>「你家裡這一向比起以前，是多用呢？還是少用呢？」</p>
<p>「唉·那裡會少用！」伯唐嘆息說。「可是各項用費都没有增加，增加的就是伙食！」</p>
<p>「大概每月要增加多少？」</p>
<p>「那眞可觀啊！現在每天兩頓，一共要開十四桌上飯，每桌除米不算是做一塊五角包的，這就是二十一塊一天，六百三十塊一月；至於下飯和米價每月也得兩百多塊。所以伙食每月竟要九百。以前每月不到兩百呀！」</p>
<p>「這樣的供給，要支持到甚麽時候呢？」</p>
<p>「這件事誰都不曉得！大槪在這裡逃難的人總要住到不打仗的時候罷！「他們」多數是無處可搬的，要末只有回家鄕去；然而一時那個就肯回家鄕，並且那還不是要由我給他們籌盤纒。所以這筆伙食費，至少要預備兩個月。」</p>
<p>「再加上家裡的各項用費······」</p>
<p>「那末每月至少也是一千四五百塊了！」</p>
<p>「如若要預備兩個月，就是三千了！」</p>
<p>「這是我這裏一家用的；還有「爺老爺」那裏一家呢？」</p>
<p>「每月要多少？」</p>
<p>「連家用帶「爺老爺」的消遣零用，至少也得一千五。」</p>
<p>「至少？」</p>
<p>「或者不妨說是大槪，因爲有時候，「爺老爺」手頭寛一點，也吩咐我可以拖一下，不過我應當按月預備去聽候吩咐。」</p>
<p>「那末如若要預備兩個月，也就是三千了！」</p>
<p>「兩項一共是六千。連廠裏要用的一共是一萬三。」</p>
<p>「這是出去的數目，這兩個月裏可以進來的呢？」</p>
<p>「進來的嗎？可憐！你曉得的，就是我可以望牠進來的；除了正源答應本月半的三千之外，傍的那裏還有個錢進來！」</p>
<p>「那末連廠裏的九千多，也還不到一萬三！時候再延長，就得另想辦法了！」</p>
<p>「在本埠是没有辦好想的！幾處房子都押掉了，雖然可以加押，但是現在是没有法子調頭，因此就是無從加押。那末就要靠外埠的當店帮忙了。然而南京和鎭江的那兩家，前幾天困爲逃難的人紛紛擠當，無法應付，已經掛了「止當候贖」的牌，那已經都不能替我們帮忙了。寗波的和紹興的兩處，若是戰區不再擴大，或許還可以有點盈餘，不過這斷不是目前就可以打算的事。」</p>
<p>伯唐說到這裏，之光也很覺悵然，彼此面對面地看了半天，誰也没有說一個字。末了，伯唐立起身來，掻了一回頭髮，然後在從新坐下來的時候說：</p>

<h3 id="c296">說高等華人 <a href="#c296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>高等華人這名詞一定不不像「長衫同志」那樣生硬剌眼，因爲前者已經載諸史籍·假如考據家因之而引經據典也是很容易的。</p>
<p>然而高等華人和長衫同志頗有區别，也是很顯而易見的，即就外表上說，高等華人常愛穿西墏，和洋人一般無二。而且很講究。譬如夏天應當穿淡色的，秋天穿棕色或灰色的，到冬天自然是深灰　是黑色了。至於領結皮鞋都一定和西裝的顏色相配，乃是用不着說明的了。但是並不是說每一個高等華人都愛穿西墏，因爲要表示華人的身份，所以長衫馬褂也很相宜，不過是偶一爲之罷了。</p>
<p>高等華人多半是呆以說幾句洋話的，很能夠和洋人禮讓往來，鞠躬握手。他們多半是到過外國游歷過，甚至留學幾年。他們對於外洋的文物風光，懂得不少，譬如聖誕節是十二月二十五，那一天是外國淸明，大概决不會弄錯。他們說話做事都不能缺乏一些洋氣，因爲和洋大人往來習慣的原故，所以揮斯迪克，戴歪帽子，最時髦的是以「ＯＫ」代替「Ａllright」。</p>
<p>不消說，他們是附庸於洋人的勢力之下的，說得再明白一點，是外國人在中國所辦洋行公司，他們都樂於供職，次之如洋華合資的企業，也肯盡力投資。至於自己的元寳和鈔洋，必須儲蓄於外國銀行，因爲比較的靠得住些似的。他如中國一切事情的混亂糟糕，他們總是非常憤恨的。對於土匪綁票之類，固然切齒咒駡，即對於土頭土腦的中國官吏，也不免要放出嘘嘘之聲。他們對於收回越界築路或是收回租界，常有一種說不出的痛苦，因爲旣不便公然反對，又很担心帝國主義勢力的削弱。幸而是收回越界築路等高調，祗不過偶而唱唱而已，决不會眞的成爲事實，所以還不致於使他們抑鬰以終。總之，他們是和藍眼晴高鼻樑相依爲命的，外國人在中國的勢力一日不會消滅，他們的存在就有一日的延長。</p>
<p>很明白，他們在中國有着顯著的勢力，以洋話駡西崽不過是他們權威的最平常的表現，最大的是當道的大官員也很借重他們，</p>
<p>華人旣曰高等，那末他們的生活自然也因之高人一等。譬如電車的「　Ｃ」便是爲了他們和他們的主人而設。三層樓的住屋，别克汽車，抱着姨太太大愚園路上兜風，旣寫意而且神氣。鳴呼噫唏，如此而已。</p>

<p>— 炳</p>
<p>讀了吾君的「論長衫同志」，也許因爲自己有些靠近這隊伍，經吾君掻着了癢處的原故，不禁惘然者久之。</p>
<p>誠然，目前的長衫同志，其生活，其意識，其一切的一切，都在極度的矛盾中扮演。但我們要追問一句，爲什麽這樣矛盾呢？答案便是：「這是時代造成的！」進而考究其所有的社會基礎到底怎樣？根本錯誤又在那裏？這似乎需要一番網領的說明。</p>
<p>過去，在中國，所謂長衫同志，雖非盡屬亨達之流，頭戴紅頂子，身穿花龍袍，出入於廟堂宮庭之間；但在社會上確有其堅實基礎，這基礎便是廣大的富庶農村，他們摭拾了古昔聖賢的唾沬，滲入「天王聖明」的德政（？），專門替統治階級在文化上做鎭壓與麻醉工作，換句話說，歷代的長衫同志，都是皇家的代言人，拑制思想自由的魔鬼，維護現狀的蝸牛，以此邀賞皇上，偶爾氣運亨通，便可高登龍門，佔據要津，否則也可頂起「秀才」「舉人」的鬼幌，在社會上横衝直　，招搖欺騙，一生吸吮農民血汗。</p>
<p>這便是陶希聖敎授所不絕於口的「士大夫階級，」依據歷史法則，這種人在以農業經濟爲基調的封建社會上才能存在而有勢力，消至商業資本社會，也還能相當的維繋其生命，但一臨今日之工商業資本主義社會，他們便像斷了線的吊珠，毫無方向的瞎滾了，資本家不</p>
<p>需用你，統治階級的容量也有限，而且最怕你不忠實，處此情境，旣不能上，又不能下，後退犯不着，前進又没勇氣，終日躊躇，徬徨，於是乎其生活，其意識，其一切的一切，都陷入矛盾中了。</p>
<p>因爲是長衫，究竟比下等階級的人來得聰明·對於舒服生活的要求，幾乎比得上上等階級，不問較自己生活過得低下的人千千萬萬，只日夜夢求自己的舒服；而又因上等的資本家重重榨取，横使願莫能償，於是乎苦，苦，呌苦連天。</p>
<p>因爲這生活的矛盾，意識更隨而激進的矛盾，矜持虚假的體面，刻意學取上等階級，即不能上升，也總想要維護其本階級，這願望不能達到，便又來一度意識上的痛苦。</p>
<p>確確實實現在的長衫同志是痛苦極了，前途更是漆黑一團。</p>
<p>但假使能澈底覺醒，力謀自救，倒也並非全無希望，不過首先需要認淸兩點：</p>
<p>㈠舊的「士大夫階級」旣已没落，新的「士大夫階級」也斷無建立的可能，不要夢想階級的保守，更不要夢想階級的</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>上升，因爲這是時代所絕不允許了的夢，應亟把小布爾喬亞的意識轉換爲普羅列達利亞意識，至少應朝對這方向去追求。</p>
<p>㈡社會的演進，是漸次趨重於技術方面的智慧了專靠空口說白話，已不切用，應以勞動的精神，，去追求一般的技術生活，不羞與勞動者携手，不羞與勞動者爲伍，揭發自己一切的虚僞。</p>
<p>這樣，時代儘管動盪，震撼，我想長衫同志將來不但不會恐怖，且能在社會上穩站住生活的一角。</p>

<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>部車風馳電逝地向郊野奔去，郊野已波動着春天的翠綠了。太陽的暖氣已徵發出許多小鳥和蜜蜂在空中飛，駘蕩的風吹柳柳纒在白色李上。李石喬老是看着車窗外，他好像第一次看到春天，美麗的春天，他更懷疑這柔和的春天居然還在人間，一種新生的希望輸活了他久被烏烟城市所殭化了的血液·他幾乎要歡喜得狂呼起來。</p>
<p>田野裏，己漸漸看到那無盡長似的蜿蜒迤邐的戰壕配着鐵絲網的線條，這就是我軍的第二道防線，他暗敬着這偉大的工程，而後方紅綠燈下的殘影更深深使他咀咒起來，這時候已快到江灣的陣地，他回望到那閘北戰敗的殘壨，那些屋頂的炮痕，成堆的瓦爍，忍不住咬緊牙關地自言自語道：「我們總有報仇雪恨的一天！」</p>
<p>（二十二）前線上的周紹平</p>
<p>他到學生義勇軍的駐紥地下了車，第一個便去找周紹平，然而周紹平却已不在這學生軍裏了。因爲多數的學生軍到底缺乏實地的訓練，大都逞於一時的熱血，不宜於作戰，現在學生義勇軍已全部改任救護工作了，而周紹平則以不能上火綫爲苦，已單獨請求加入第ＸＸ師第三團正式作戰。當李石喬尋到第三團的陣地，那裏的士兵們正蹲伏在新近掘開的黃土裏，兇狠地啃嚼着他們那稀少的給養·胸牆上面，僅留少數的監視兵擔任警戒。</p>
<p>在左側，一帶小叢林的「抽出樹」上，更另設有瞭望哨，監視較遠的地方。　　忽然，右上空有三機編隊的敵機發現，機聲異常沉重，顯然是一隊爆撃機。那幾個瞭望哨搖着手語，散在路上走着的士兵們，便一齊舖伏在地面上。李石喬也自然地作着同樣的動作。等到飛機的轟聲漸漸遠了，他才站起來再向戰壕邊走，但有一個士兵正迎向他而來，而且很遠地便向他舉手致敬，他定了一定神，才看出那士兵原來就是周紹平，兩人見面時的熱烈是不消說得，緊握着手好幾分鐘不肯放。周紹平完全變成一個老兵的模樣了。在黎黑的皮色裏再也看不到書生的白影了，他不禁由衰地讚奬着周紹平道：「你眞不愧一位民族的靑年英雄！」</p>
<p>周紹平也由衰的回敬道：</p>
<p>「你在後方的工作也很有成績呀！你不是邀　不少人組織　　　ＸＸＸＸ團體聯合會嗎？」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Successful Reception Yesterday <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>After Arriving at Yuyu, the Special Train Returned to Qindao. Our Police Force, After Disembarking at Yuyu, Was Prevented From Proceeding. The Northern Route Reception Personnel Will Depart This Morning Due to Rain. (Qinhuangdao) This time, the Magistrate of Luandong County, led by Yin Tong, departed from Tang and arrived in Changli that evening. Originally intending to continue onward and reach Yuguan directly, the Railway Bureau stated that its orders only allowed it to go as far as Changli. Repeated negotiations proved ineffective. That day, there was heavy rain along the route, and the police force was riding in open carriages, so their uniforms were soaked. After the Magistrate of Changli County and the Chief of the Security Corps disembarked, the special train stopped there. The next morning at 4:00 AM, it headed east and arrived at Liushouying, Funing, on the 5th. Magistrate Liu, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, and the security team disembarked there. The original train continued east and arrived in Qindao at 6:00 AM. Yin Tong and Magistrate Yin disembarked in Qindao to meet with the local Japanese leader. It happened that Chief Liu of the Beining Railway was also there to negotiate traffic matters. The police force then took the original train to Yuyu, arriving at 7:00 AM. During this special train's passage, the Japanese frequently inquired in Tang, Luan, and Qin, especially in Luan County, where they repeatedly summoned and questioned them several times amidst heavy rain. After arriving at Yuyu, Japanese garrison troops, military police, and Manchukuo border police gathered at the station and prevented them from disembarking. Finally, Police Captain Zhu went to meet with Japanese Captain Ochiai, who stated that he had not received orders and could not allow armed personnel to disembark here. He suggested that they disarm completely and, in his personal capacity, wished that the team would quickly withdraw from Yuguan. After fruitless negotiations, they returned to Qin on the original train at 11:30 AM. By this time, Yin Tong, Magistrate Yin, and Chief Liu of the Beining Railway had arrived, and they immediately went together to the Japanese Garrison Headquarters to continue negotiations. However, as of 8:00 PM, there was no news from Yuyu. The outcome is yet to be reported. It is said that negotiations are ongoing. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tangshan) Reception in Changli began smoothly at 8:00 AM on the 28th. The Security Corps Headquarters is located in Changli. Zi Xizhe assumed his duties at the same time. Lulong and Qian'an Leting counties were received at 10:00 AM this morning, and Linyu was scheduled to be received this morning by personnel from Linyu. The security team accompanied them. Yutian was scheduled to be received this morning by personnel from Tangshan. The county public security team accompanied them. Fengrun was received on the 27th. Linyu is encountering obstacles. The special train departed from Changli at 4:00 AM for Linguan and then returned to Qinhuangdao to wait. Yin Tong is currently in talks with the Commander of the Kwantung Army stationed in Yuguan. Most of the Japanese troops in Yuguan are still holding the Shishui River west of Yuyu. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Provincial Government received a telegram from Luan County Magistrate Zhang Jinchen reporting that the reception had been successfully completed. There should be no problems in Leting and Changli. Funing, Lulong, and Linyu may have minor issues. Long-distance telephone lines in Tangshan have been severely damaged. Additional staff were dispatched on the 28th to repair them. Telephone service should be restored by the end of the month. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Qindao states that the special train for receiving the war zone arrived at Liushouying at 5:00 AM this morning. Funing County Magistrate Liu Xingpei, Public Security Bureau Chief Song Ziyou, and over a hundred security police officers disembarked to receive the county. After arriving in Qindao, Yin Tong and Linyu County Magistrate Yin Shousong disembarked to meet with Liu Shisun. They arrived at Yuyu at 7:00 AM, but because no agreement had been reached, the special train was pursued and returned to Qindao at noon to await orders. Yin Tong, Liu Shisun, and Magistrate Yin arrived in Yuyu at noon and continued negotiations with the Japanese Garrison Commander Ruohe. Yin will go to Changchun after the reception is completed to continue talks about restoring traffic on the Tang-Yuyu section of the railway. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the reception of the war zone, the magistrates and public security bureau chiefs of the eastern route counties departed from Tianjin yesterday morning. They disembarked at various stations along the Beining Railway line to receive their respective counties. However, due to the large number of bandits in Qian'an, Leting, and Lulong counties, reception will be slightly delayed. There are rumors that the Japanese, citing the Boxer Protocol, will station troops along the Beining Railway to monitor military affairs. Officials deny this. After the counties are received, the first step will be to carry out a cleanup, and the second step will be to reorganize the government. Regarding the resumption of traffic on the Beining Railway, because the reception work has not been completed, traffic will temporarily continue only to Tangshan. Negotiations on direct service to Yuyu have not yet been concluded. The reception on the northern route was originally scheduled to begin today, but due to heavy rain in the past few days, the Pingmi Avenue has accumulated a lot of water, and long-distance buses cannot pass. Therefore, the reception personnel have rescheduled their departure for tomorrow, and will first receive Miyun and Huairou counties. The magistrate of Ji County also left Beiping with them, but whether reception will be possible has not yet been decided. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Tongzhou states that bandits in Ji County have risen up and occupy various areas, setting up sentry posts and checkpoints with strict defenses. They engage in rape, looting, and all sorts of evils, making reception quite difficult. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Shunyi states that the pseudo-Public Security Branch Chief who occupied Niulanshan withdrew to Huairou the day before yesterday. The county government was preparing to send personnel to receive it, but unexpectedly, the pseudo-Branch Chief returned yesterday with pseudo-police and is still stationed there as usual. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xue Zhiheng and Lei Shourong telegraphed Huang He from Tangshan on the 26th stating that approximately a thousand disbanded troops were transported from the Changli area and should arrive at Tang Station this afternoon. The Hebei Provincial Government should send police to Lutai to receive and transport them. Li Fang will send personnel to the disembarkation point to verify the actual number of people and hand them over by name. (28th Special Dispatch) (Beiping) Qian Zongze telegraphed Huang Fu on the 27th stating that two trains of reception personnel departed eastward from Tangshan on the 27th, one in the afternoon and the other later, without any problems. Yin also accompanied the train eastward. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qian Zongze stated that Huang Fu is negotiating the restoration of traffic on the Beining Railway. Now that the reception of the counties is underway, it should not be far off. Yin Tong's special train arrived in Yuyu this morning. Yin disembarked, and the empty train returned to Qindao, where it is currently waiting at the station. His own visit to Beiping is to attend the War Zone Relief Committee meeting on the 29th, and he will return to Tianjin that evening. Yu is planning to come to Beiping soon. The special train is waiting at the station for departure. (28th Special Dispatch) (Beiping) Ji County Magistrate Sun Shan, guided by Liaison Officer Lin Wenxiang, led fifty security police officers through Tongzhou to take up his post. They are scheduled to arrive in Su County on the 29th and handle the reception there as scheduled. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Military Attaché Shibayama of the Japanese Embassy is scheduled to meet with Suzuki, Commander of the Japanese Brigade in Miyun, tomorrow morning and will go to Miyun with Sun Shutang and others. They will return to Beiping in the afternoon. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Remaining Pseudo-Troops</p>
<h3 id="e2">All Sent Away <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Many Jumped From the Train and Escaped</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Used Machine Guns to Fire</p>
<p>(Tangshan) The fourth train of Li Jichun's troops departed from Xugezhuang for the Jinpu Railway line at noon. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Only over two thousand of Li's disbanded pseudo-troops arrived at Machang. The Hebei Province is struggling to find a place to settle them. Fortunately, a recruiting committee from Jiangxi Province is willing to recruit them to go south. (28th Special Dispatch) (Tianjin) Over a thousand disbanded pseudo-troops passed through Tianjin at 5:00 PM on the 28th en route to Machang. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) One train carrying pseudo-troops disbanded by Anshan arrived in Tangshan at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Over twenty pseudo-troops on the train suddenly disembarked and attempted to escape. The Japanese troops guarding the station captured three of them and took them to the guard post. The other dozen or so hid in the station and escaped. The sound of gunfire caused a brief panic among the people in Tangshan. There are still Japanese officers stationed along the railway east of Lu County who are scheduled to withdraw to Yuguan after our side takes over. In the future, a small number of troops will be left in Beidaihe and Qindao. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The third batch of Li Jichun's disbanded troops, over fourteen hundred people, boarded a train at Xugezhuang on the 28th and passed through Tianjin at 4:00 PM en route to Machang for disbandment without stopping along the way. Many of these soldiers were killed or injured while jumping from the train and escaping. Only a few hundred remained when they passed through Tianjin. This is the last batch of troops disbanded by Li. However, when the second batch arrived at Machang yesterday, local residents refused to allow them to disembark due to concerns about local security following the mutiny of Zheng Guilin's troops.

<p>(Nanjing) The Navy intends to dispatch several larger warships to the site to conduct an on-the-spot investigation into the French occupation of the nine small islands and has requested that the government send special commissioners to accompany them. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e4">Jiang Wang and Others Continue to Confer <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Huang Fu Rushes to Discuss North China Political Affairs</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Lushan Conference was originally scheduled to end on the 27th, but because Huang Fu went to Lushan to discuss North China political affairs in person and Sun Ke was also invited from Qingdao to discuss major plans, it must be extended for a day or two.

It has now been decided to resolve the Chahar issue peacefully. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

When asked about the Japanese troops stationed along the Beining Railway, Huang replied that since his arrival in North China, his goal has been to restore the situation to what it was before the Yuguan battle in January, and that the Luandong area is gradually returning to its former state. As for the Chahar situation, the Beiping authorities are striving to resolve it peacefully and politically and still hope for success. Haste makes waste.

<h3 id="e5">No Intention to Use Force Against Chahar <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Hoping That the Southwest Committees Will Exercise Restraint for the Sake of the Country (Guangzhou) Wang Jiang sent a telegram to Chen Jitang and Li Zongren yesterday stating that the central government has no intention of using force against Chahar and that it is determined to take a moderate attitude toward all other major issues and wait for the Fifth National Congress to resolve them. Please do not easily believe rumors and kindly advise the Southwest Committees to exercise restraint for the sake of the country. Right and wrong will eventually become clear. Chen replied by telegram promising to be responsible for offering kind advice and stated that the Southwest is working hard to suppress the communists. (28th Shenshi News Agency Dispatch) (Nanjing) The central government has consistently sought to resolve the Chahar issue peacefully. After Feng Yuxiang softened his attitude, President Wang sent Xie Zhiru with a personal letter to Zhangjiakou to meet with Feng. At the recent Lushan Conference, Wang Jiang also thoroughly discussed the Chahar issue. The focus of the Chahar issue has now shifted from Beiping to Nanjing Guling. Feng recently replied to Wang by telegram, indicating that he has had a considerable awakening. Although specific solutions have not yet matured, there is indeed an understanding between Nanjing and Zhangjiakou. The general hope is to seek a solution through political means. Now we are only waiting for Huang Fu to go to Lushan to consult with Jiang Wang, and then there will be significant developments in the Chahar situation. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>The "First Pass" Plaque is Safe and Sound</p>
<p>(Qinhuangdao) A reporter arrived at Yuyu Station on the morning of the 28th, and inspection was very strict. Many shops have opened in Yuguan since it was reopened. The South Gate is full, and the city gate tower was also destroyed by artillery fire. The civilian houses near the gate in the city were affected, so the rebuilt houses and roads have been turned into a new street market full of various slogans. The city's telegraph bureau has been changed to Yuryori and the garrison headquarters has been relocated to the Miyamoto unit. The Hattori Brigade is stationed in the private residence of the Tian family. However, the "First Pass" plaque is safe and sound. Currently, the puppet state divides the barbed wire city outside the First Pass into the puppet state, and the maintenance committee is responsible for the inside of Linyu County. As for the county magistrate and public security bureau chief selected by Li Fang, they are in Haiyangzhen. Therefore, the current Linyu County has been divided into a fragmented phenomenon. All schools except the girls' school have been suspended, and the boys' schools are continuing as usual, but the courses on party righteousness have been cancelled. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

Therefore, he is filled with resentment and indulges in sensual pleasures. Recently, he secretly summoned his child attendants Xiao Wang, Si Li, and San Li from Tianjin to Changchun and keeps them hidden in a secret room all day long, living together and no longer appearing to see outsiders. Therefore, Puyi's wife, Ms. Rong, often quarrels with him, and the couple is at odds. Recently, Ms. Rong has been diagnosed with a mental disorder due to excessive anger. Her father, Rong Hou, has sent people to Ping and hired Dr. Hu Ji of the Imperial Hospital to go to Changchun for diagnosis and treatment.

<h3 id="e16">The Realistic Prospects for Peace After Receiving Luandong <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The tense situation in North China, from the Tanggu Truce Agreement to the establishment of the Dalian Conference, has undergone several negotiations and twists and turns before the realization of receiving Luandong. Today, Fengrun, Tangshan, Yutian, Luan County, etc., have been received by our country's county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs. At the same time, the five counties of Luandong, such as Changli, Linyu, Funing, Qian'an, and Lulong, will all see the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun once again. From then on, relations between China and Japan seem to be entering a peaceful state, and the severity of the world's war potential for the past half year will also be eliminated as a result. However, we cannot help but feel worried when observing the facts. Before Luandong was received, we felt that it would be difficult for our side to exercise political power if the Japanese army stayed for a long time without withdrawing, and that the presence of pseudo-troops would be an impediment to China, with one side being instructed by the Japanese army and the other using the beautiful name of national self-determination to obstruct China. This is what we deeply worry about. Now that Luandong has been received in order, the Japanese army is still stationed along the Beining Line under the pretext of the Boxer Protocol, and even printed documents forcing our county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs to report all announcements to the Japanese army headquarters, which is tantamount to our country's officials being subject to Japanese control, which greatly hinders the integrity of our country's political power. Furthermore, from the perspective of the pseudo-Manchukuo, the Japanese army is again using the pretext of the safety of the Manchukuo puppet state, proclaiming their so-called first line of national defense. Before the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, they considered Korea to be the first line, and after Korea was annexed, their line of national defense expanded from Korea to Manchuria. Today, it is expanding from Manchuria to Jehol and Inner Mongolia, and their line of national defense is getting closer and closer. This is nothing more than wanting to implement their continental policy, which is one of the things we painfully feel uneasy about.</p>
<p>Before the Japanese military clique forcibly occupied the three northeastern provinces, they regarded them as their exclusive possession. After occupying our three northeastern provinces, their ambitions became even more intense, and they actually regarded our entire country as their exclusive possession. Therefore, when our country discussed technical cooperation with the League of Nations, they repeatedly issued threats and did their best to obstruct it. When they heard the theory that the American warship Fulton was transporting military supplies and landing them in Xiamen, they fabricated the so-called secret agreement to establish a province in Fujian, and further exaggerated their words, saying that the United States would ensure its naval base in Dongshan Bay. These are all enough to show their aggressive ambitions and are concrete evidence of regarding our entire country as their exclusive possession, which is the second thing that makes us feel painfully uneasy.</p>
<p>The reason why the Japanese military harbors such extravagant hopes is that they first put Manchuria into their pockets, and then use us to solve their country's political difficulties and overcome the contradictions of the economic crisis. However, unexpectedly, in the year and a half since then, they have not been able to do as they wished, and all the powerful countries in Europe and America are eagerly cultivating the economies of colonies and semi-colonies, and especially paying attention to the markets of the Far East. Whether it is Britain, the United States, France, or Germany, they all have considerable historical relations with China. Britain has special connections with the Yangtze River basin, from commerce and industry to finance. The United States has never abandoned its desire to develop the East. By assisting the development of its economic strength with money, its position in China can be particularly enhanced. The longer the influence of Britain and the United States in the Yangtze River basin market, the more the influence of Japan in the Yangtze River basin decreases. This is what the Japanese authorities deeply fear. They also saw that after the adjournment of the World Economic Conference, the theory of international cooperation was temporarily impossible to realize. Regardless of Britain and the United States, they will do their best to engage in economic alliances within the old scope in order to stabilize their domestic markets. They will never use military force to assist overseas development and lightly start their second world war. Our country has no real strength to stop their military aggression for a time. Therefore, they first launched a large-scale malicious propaganda against the League of Nations and the United States, and then added all kinds of threats, meaning that if the countries followed Japan's advice, they would use military force to destroy this market. Alas, where is the face of maintaining world peace that they usually proclaim?</p>
<p>Recalling the dispute over the Manchurian issue at the Geneva Conference, former US President said that only those who can defend themselves with arms can ensure peace, in order to satirize our need to rise up and defend ourselves and not rely on others. Today, the Chief of Staff of the US Army also said that preparing adequate defense at all times is the greatest guarantee of peace. The current urgency to expand the navy and army is an expression of the implementation of this statement. And others, such as Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, are also striving to enrich their military equipment. As for Japan, in order to prevent armed aggression by others, it wants to use armed aggression against others. Therefore, its efforts to rectify its military strength are more urgent than those of other countries. The saying that armed forces guarantee peace has become the iron rule of today. In short, it is to compete with armed forces. Our country is in a situation of armed encirclement, and if it does not urgently seek armed self-defense, the country will be in danger. If it cannot defend itself with arms, and it cannot unite the whole country and strengthen its organization to defend itself economically, then the country will surely perish. Now that Luandong has been received, there are still many worries about the future. If we want to avoid these worries, is it armed self-defense or economic self-defense? If both are unavailable, can we still ask the way?</p>

<p>Has Deep Understanding of French Military Equipment. When Will the Northeast Debt Be Settled?</p>
<p>(Paris) At 5:00 PM today, General Zhang Xueliang gave a speech to the Parisian press, stating, "My travels to the major European capitals are aimed at gathering political and military information, with particular emphasis on military matters. My observations here have given me a great understanding of your nation's army, navy, and air force. The relationship between China and France has always been cordial, and the relationship between our two peoples is particularly friendly and is becoming increasingly close. In terms of transportation, French aviators and Citroën automobile survey teams are engaged in communication across the skies and lands of China and France, which greatly interests me. Furthermore, I have plans to use modern, rapid methods to develop transportation between China and European countries. Studying this aspect is also one of the goals of this trip. As for the political aspect, I can tell you that French thought has had a profound impact on the establishment of the Republic of China, and our nation's political system is also modeled after France." A reporter asked for his opinion on the Manchurian Incident and the impact this incident might have. Zhang simply said, "I don't know when this debt can be settled." Someone else asked about his impressions of the meeting with Mussolini in Rome. Zhang replied, "I greatly admire him." Zhang then bid farewell to the representatives of various newspapers, saying that Foreign Minister Yinggu hosted a banquet this afternoon with exceptional courtesy. In addition, he was warmly received by people in political and business circles, and he was grateful for their guidance in visiting various major [places]. He asked to have this announced on his behalf. The General's official mission is only to observe, as the people have already clearly stated, and his aides also stated that he did not order any items in Rome, London, or Paris. During his visit, Zhang met with Sea Chief Leighton and Foreign Minister Penggu successively. Zhang was very interested in aviation matters and visited Villacoublay and Le Bourget airfields, as well as studying night flight and visiting numerous aircraft factories in Chartres. He also conducted some research on aviation matters in Rome. Within a week, Zhang will be in contact with French industrialists, also for the purpose of investigation. After that, Zhang will travel from here to London, then to Berlin. If there is time, he will return to Paris once more before returning to Rome and then returning to China at some point.

<p>(Washington) The U.S. Treasury Department and other government personnel are currently studying the impact of the nine-nation silver agreement and the five-nation silver agreement signed in London. According to official interpretations received here, the amount purchased annually by the five nations of the U.S., Australia, Canada, Mexico, and Peru will be 35 million ounces, which is exactly equal to the amount that India is permitted to sell under the nine-nation agreement. It is claimed that the nine-nation agreement only stipulates the total amount of sales and purchases, while the five-nation agreement allocates the purchase quotas. Therefore, the silver purchased and stored in the national treasury by the five governments each year will be 35 million ounces, not 70 million ounces. However, the total amount not flowing into the market during these years will far exceed this amount, due to restrictions on the sale of stored silver. It is claimed that Spain has notified all countries that although it can sell 5 million ounces per year, it will still store it without selling. (National News Agency Telegraph, 27th)</p>

This is because Attorney General Cumming, after approving the Treasury Department's request to study current laws and bans related to the export of gold, believes that refined and smelted gold cannot be exported, and only unrefined ore can be transported abroad, but the high cost of transporting ore makes it unprofitable to export.

<p>(Washington) Tonight, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture stated that the United States will no longer wait for wheat-producing countries to reach an agreement in London, and will immediately find ways to market its stored wheat and can allocate the newly levied processing tax to subsidize purchases. However, since most European countries currently have wheat import quotas, the efforts of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration will focus on the Far East. He believes that although China and Soviet Russia have already placed orders in the United States, their actual needs are even greater. Currently, the United States can offer special preferential credit terms to wheat buyers, and if the wheat purchased is from the northwestern states, transportation costs can also be reduced appropriately. This is because the United States is eager to dispose of stored wheat before the new wheat comes to market. It is expected that once the stored wheat is sold, world wheat prices will rise sharply. Although representatives of wheat-producing countries will meet again in London on August 22 to attempt to negotiate an agreement on production and export quotas, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is very doubtful whether the meeting will be successful as desired and said that since the first meeting failed to reach an agreement, and countries are now trying to market their stored wheat, the United States should do the same. The current wheat processing tax is 30 cents per bushel, and he believes that 20 cents of it can be allocated to subsidize wheat sales to the Far East. Although the processing tax will be reduced after wheat prices rise, the extent of the price increase still largely depends on whether the surplus can be disposed of. (National Telegraph, 27th)</p>

Wallace stated that the distribution of next year's wheat production will be 456,198,000 bushels, and this will be the basis for awarding bonuses. Those who agree to reduce their wheat fields by up to 20% will be eligible for this bonus. It is found that this distribution figure is 54% of the average annual wheat production in the United States in the past five years. Farmers who agree to reduce wheat fields will receive a bonus of 28 cents per bushel based on the distributed production amount. This payment will be allocated from the flour mill processing tax.

In terms of recording work, the amount of paper used can be estimated at about 8 tons, and the number of small booklets printed for distribution is approximately 2 million. Furthermore, since the opening of the London Economic Conference, the British government's expenses, according to today's evening newspaper, are £50,000, and the hospitality expenses spent by a district in London have reached £20,000.

<h3 id="e32">Failure of the Economic Conference <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The United States Expected It Long Ago</p>
<p>Cousins Expresses His Views After Arriving in the US</p>
<p>Hull Leads Delegation to Leave England and Return Home</p>
<p>(New York) U.S. Senator Cousins, along with other U.S. representatives who attended the Economic Conference, returned from London today. According to Cousins' opinion, the U.S. Congress' repeal of the gold standard and the inclusion of the inflation amendment in the rural recovery plan, and the subsequent depreciation of the gold yuan, had already created a web of failure for the World Economic Conference in advance. Although the hopes that people had for the Economic Conference were excessive from the beginning, and looking at the development of the situation in London, holding the conference this year was a miscalculation. None of the people in the U.S. delegation were not disappointed with the results of the conference, but they all believed that it was opened too early, leading to this situation. This is because when the U.S. delegation was about to depart for London, the situation in the United States changed too rapidly, and the gold yuan began to depreciate rapidly after Congress repealed the gold standard. Under this situation, it was impossible to stabilize it. By the time the conference opened, the gold yuan price was in the process of finding a level line, and it would obviously be futile to discuss stability at that time. They saw this situation before departing, but they did not expect that the issue of stability would prevent the progress of other issues, so that they could not have a detailed discussion on major issues. As for the Economic Conference being reconvened this autumn, he is not very optimistic, believing that in the current world, attempting such a large-scale reorganization is not the best strategy. Although he still firmly believes that the convening of this conference was not without benefits, even if it could not be resolved, it has exposed all the problems of various countries as much as possible. There is no other way to make one country aware of the urgent economic events of other countries as thoroughly as this. Once we are fully aware of all aspects of a problem, we will be able to judge the proposed solutions more easily. Therefore, the benefits of this conference will be seen in the future. Cousins also said that although the representatives of various countries were resolute in their attitude when discussing the issue of stability, they always discussed calmly in a friendly spirit, and there were never any fierce quarrels with flushed faces and red ears.

<p>(London) This morning, most newspapers published editorials about the postponement of the Economic Conference, all unanimously acknowledging that it is impossible to reach a satisfactory understanding of the various cases listed on the agenda at this time of serious world economic crisis. The Times stated that although this conference did not achieve any practical results, it did make progress in removing all obstacles so that a concrete result could be obtained at the second conference. However, this conference is unnecessary to reopen until President Roosevelt's policy on the dollar exchange rate and the economic relations between the United States and the world is effective.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities today expressed the following views on the adjournment of the World Economic Conference: It is regrettable that the Economic Conference failed to achieve the goal of overcoming the economic downturn and adjourned, and it can mean its factual failure. The tariff war will inevitably intensify in the future, but as for Japan, there is no pessimism about the adjournment. After the adjournment of the conference, Japan will aim to restore most-favored-nation treatment with each other, and will reciprocally coordinate with various countries individually. However, those who oppress Japanese commerce will be dealt with in a retaliatory manner. (Dentsu Telegraph, 28th)</p>

<p>United States Intervenes in Mediation Result</p>
<p>Revolutionary Bloodshed May Temporarily Cease</p>
<p>National, Havana, 20th - Today, the Cuban president signed an executive order granting amnesty to all political prisoners, some of whom have been banned for more than two years on trumped-up charges. This amnesty is the first concrete result of a meeting between the Cuban government, the opposition, and the US ambassador, who served as an intermediary. It is expected that the bloodshed and disturbances that have frequently occurred in Cuba since the suspension of constitutional guarantees two years ago may be temporarily terminated after this special pardon. However, those who attended the meeting on behalf of the opposition were not leading figures because the government still prohibits ordered guests from returning to the country. However, it is heard that former President Mino Caer, the leader of the opposition, is currently residing in Miami, USA, and will soon return to the country to personally negotiate with incumbent President Machado. Since the amnesty order was issued, people here generally expect the Cuban president to find a way to select</p>

<p>Hungarian Prime Minister Leaves Rome to Return Home</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 28th - Hungarian Prime Minister Gombos and his entourage are scheduled to return from here at 7:50 this evening. Italian leader Mussolini left Rome yesterday, so the main talks between Hungary and Italy have now concluded. However, before Gombos and Hungarian Foreign Minister Gania set off, they will still consult with Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich at the Hungarian Embassy luncheon.</p>
<p>National, Vienna, 27th - The Austrian capital is paying close attention to the Hungarian Prime Minister Gongbo's visit to Italy. According to a report from a "special diplomatic correspondent" published in today's Vienna Daily, this Gongbo's talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini have repeatedly indicated that Italy has indeed become the center of current Central European politics, and that Italy is actually the initiator of the work to reorganize the political and economic situation in the Danube River basin. The record further discussed rumors of a military secret agreement between France and Russia. The correspondent said that it is hoped that France will not join hands with Bolshevism because of various unfounded fears about unarmed Germany. If France, as the country with the most military equipment in Europe, rashly contacts Soviet Russia, the common enemy of the social and economic organization of the entire Europe, France will make an immeasurable political mistake, because only Soviet Russia will benefit from the establishment of this treaty. Therefore, if a military secret agreement between France and Russia is a fact, it is tantamount to European suicide.</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 28th - The saying that Austria and Hungary are joining hands economically seems to have progressed. Austrian Labor Minister Stummer declared to "Hungarian Communications" that he agrees with the economic cooperation between Hungary and Austria, which is not a customs alliance, and that the agricultural and industrial resources of the two countries can be used by each other.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Record of the Great Academic Exploration of Manchuria and Mongolia (2) (Translated from Osaka Asahi Shimbun) <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>According to Takeshi Nakai, Director of the Botanical Garden of Tokyo University and Doctor of Science, regarding the plants of Jehol Province, in terms of our current level of knowledge, our minds are almost blank. No one has ever investigated plants in that region. However, there is some discussion in the research papers of French botanists, but these are also old works. Considering the progress of learning today, there are many points that should be corrected. I recall that twenty years ago, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce secretly investigated the forests of the hunting grounds, but the obtained data was unfortunately burned during the Great Earthquake, so the truth of the investigation results at that time is also unknown. In 1864 AD, the French missionary David (A. David) went to Chengde in Jehol Province, collected some plants from the vicinity, and collected countless specimens in northern, central China, Mongolia, and eastern Siberia, sending them to Professor E. Bureau of the National Museum of Paris, France. At that time, Professor Bureau served as the assistant of A. Francbet, a famous plant taxonomist at the museum. He studied the sent specimens one by one, and as a result, he titled the plants obtained from China as "Plantae Davdianae ex Sinarum lmperio" and published it to the world.</p>
<p>The first part, volumes 5 to 7 of the "Memoirs of the Paris Museum, Series 2," was published in 1884 and recorded plants from northern and central China, Mongolia, Jehol, etc. The second part, volumes 8 to 10 of the Memoirs, was published in 1888 and recorded plants from eastern Tibet. The first part, on the plants of Jehol Province, includes 398 species, of which 15 are ferns, 80 are monocotyledons, 303 are dicotyledons, 42 are shrubs, and 26 are trees. Among these new plants, 13 new species, 17 new varieties, and 4 unusual species were unknown to the academic community at that time. However, David's collection area was only in the vicinity of Chengde. Based on our past experience, if we meticulously investigate and study the plants collected from even just one mountain range in East Asia, we can discover at least 50 new plants unknown to the academic community. Moreover, the area of Jehol to be investigated this time is very vast, including large mountains, hills, deserts, rivers, and wetlands, making it the most complex terrain in Manchuria. Therefore, future great discoveries in the field of plant taxonomy will be countless.</p>
<p>Regarding animals, according to Hisayoshi Kishida, entrusted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, in the first half of the eighth century, during the reign of Emperor Shōmu of Japan, an envoy from the Balhae Kingdom named Mong Ijin crossed over to Japan, presenting six pelts each of Manchurian tigers, red bears, and clouded leopards, three shih of honey, and countless other rare birds and animals. According to the animal catalogues of Tokumasu in 1909, Kiyonosuke Uchida in 1915, Tamemori Mori in 1922, and Shasaizhai in 1923, the same animals produced in Manchuria have similar variants in Jehol. In addition, some animals that thrive in the large deserts of the northern temperate zone of Asia, from Mongolia to Turkestan, also breed in Jehol. There are also animals similar to those in northern China, southern Manchuria, and the main part of Korea, as well as animals similar to those in northern Manchuria, northern Korea, and Sakhalin, as well as mixed desert species, all of which are included in the collection plan.</p>
<p>Regarding anthropological research, according to Ichiro Yawatā, entrusted by the East, it is speculated that traces of human ancestors can be found in the Jehol region. Manchuria and Mongolia are vast areas for anthropological activity. We should first investigate the current Manchus, Mongolians, and other Siberian peoples living along the Songhua River and Heilongjiang River, as well as their ethnological situation. This kind of investigation is very important because their physical characteristics and culture are gradually changing from their old state, and no one knows what their inherent characteristics are. On the other hand, there are many issues in the study of ancient humans that can be clarified in cooperation with paleontology and archaeology. In particular, there is a great need for anthropological explanation and research on the rise and fall of the Manchurian and Mongolian peoples and the origins of their current migrations. Therefore, the ethnic history of this region can provide powerful materials for cultural history. The area to be investigated and studied this time is spearheaded by the Dr. Torii couple, because the couple has been investigating in this area since the 40th year of Meiji, experiencing various hardships. They have discovered many remains from the Neolithic Age onwards, such as the remains, tools, and utensils of primitive humans, but no Paleolithic remains have been found there to date. It is said that traces of the ancestors of mankind can be found between Zhoukoudian, Hejiagou, and Zhalainuoer. In addition, since the Neolithic Age, the area of contention between the Han Chinese and the northern peoples is particularly worthy of our attention and research.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Chiang and Wang's Telegram Instructs Ping on Ways to Deal with Chahar <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Assess the Situation and Seek a Solution. 50,000 Troops Enter Chahar. Bandit Troops Plot to Invade Duolun.</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Since the peaceful negotiation of the Chahar incident came to a standstill, the Beiping authorities have been quietly awaiting the determination of the policy at the Lushan Conference before seeking to proceed. The Lushan Conference has already discussed ways to deal with the Chahar incident. Last night, Chiang and Wang sent a telegram to Ping instructing everything, divided into two steps. The first step is to first use letters and telegrams or send senior officials to Chahar again to earnestly negotiate and be frank with each other in order to resolve the matter as soon as possible. The second step is to take effective measures based on the actual situation to seek a thorough solution. The Ping authorities immediately proceeded according to the instructions in the telegram. Yesterday, He Yingqin invited Xiong Bin to the Jurenhan Hall to discuss matters. This morning (27th, Xiong Bin), Liu Zhilong, Jia Deyao, and others visited Song Zheyuan at the Wuyiku, hoping that Song would make further efforts to mediate. Song did not express a firm opinion due to his difficult situation and lingering back pain. However, he said that Feng was his former superior and that, at a time when the country was in such a difficult situation, he hoped for a peaceful resolution for both public and private reasons. Xie Zhiru, the representative of Wang Jingwei, previously carried Wang's personal letter to Chahar to negotiate with Feng, and he is still staying in Zhangjiakou yesterday. Responsible officials may arrive in Chahar again within the next few days. The road between Ping and Zhang will once again see the comings and goings of messengers of peace.</p>
<p>After Gong Bingxun's troops made slight changes, the forward defense area was taken over by Wang Jingjiu's 87th Division. Weng Zhaoyuan's division of Wang Yizhe's troops also moved to Kangzhuang. Guan Linzheng's division has moved one step forward. Feng Qinzai's troops are stationed near Linlai. Pang Xun's troops are responsible for the line between Shacheng and Zhuolu. The area north of Shacheng is entirely garrisoned by the Central Army. The defense areas within Juyongguan and Changping, which were left behind by Pang and Feng's troops, are temporarily taken over by Shang Zhen's troops. The area around Fengtai, which was left behind by Weng's division, is garrisoned by the Central Army. As of today, no less than 50,000 troops have entered Chahar. The vanguard has reached the vicinity of Xinzhuangzi. Sun Liangcheng's army of Feng's troops, numbering about 12,000, is stationed in the area of Xuanhua, north of Xinzhuangzi, only 14 or 15 li away from the Central Army. The two sides are separated by Xinzhuangzi. It is said that the various armies were ordered to enter Chahar, first to garrison, second to make necessary preparations, and third to take precautions because the garrison in Chahar Province is complex.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the recapture of Duolun, it was guarded by the troops of Ji Hongchang and Zhang Lingyun to search for the remnants of the enemy and to pacify the area. Recently, Ji's troops were ordered to be transferred back to Zhangbei and the vicinity of Zhangjiakou to garrison. Only Zhang Lingyun's troops were left to guard Duolun. Liu Guitang's troops were stationed in the area of Guyuan, south of Duolun. Li Zhongyi and Deng Wen's troops are stationed in the areas of Saichang and Kangbao. The Japanese and puppet troops consider Duolun and Guyuan as important border areas of the puppet state and cannot forget them. At first, they actively mobilized troops and prepared to counterattack. Recently, the Japanese army claimed to have stopped advancing, while the puppet army, seeing that Ji's troops had withdrawn from the Duolun area and the defense was weak, plotted to invade again. The troops of Cui Xingwu and Zhang Haipeng have a tendency to advance towards Duolun and Guyuan. If the Chahar incident is not resolved soon, the eastern part of Chahar may ultimately be uneasy.

<p>Discussion of Military Reform Issues</p>
<p>Resolution of the Chahar Incident Also Studied</p>
<p>Jiujiang Correspondence: Central dignitaries have gathered in Lushan one after another to discuss the current situation and all important policies. According to news from military and political organs, the Lushan Conference officially opened at Chiang's residence on the morning of the 25th. Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, Zhu Peide, Tang Shengzhi, Huang Shaohong, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Yi, Yang Yongtai, and others attended. Chairman Chiang reported on the significance of the meeting and the Military Affairs Commission's report on the national military situation. Then, the proposals of the Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Military Senate, and the Training Directorate on unifying the military organization system, the military budget, and reorganization and training were submitted one by one for discussion and approval. Detailed studies were also conducted on the construction of the air force, the reform of the navy, the unification of terms, national defense construction, and the latest military training. In the afternoon, the meeting adjourned. Wang, Chiang, and others conducted concrete discussions on the defense and security after the ceasefire in North China, the progress of negotiations with Japan and the puppet regime, and various methods for resolving the Chahar incident. It is reported that they still advocated resolving the Chahar incident by political means. The meeting continued on the morning of the 26th. If the important cases can be discussed and completed on the 27th, the meeting will be closed. The dignitaries will leave Lushan and return to Nanjing around the 28th.</p>
<p>According to another source, in addition to the formal meeting on military reform, the dignitaries also held informal consultations on the solution to the Chahar incident, the development of the Northwest, and national defense construction. (July 26)</p>

<p>Li's Troops Refuse to Concentrate at Designated Locations</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in the Tang-Yu Area Still Refuse to Withdraw</p>
<p>Yu Stresses the Substance of Receiving Political Power</p>
<p>The Dissolution of Puppet Troops in Machang is Also Worrying</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Tianjin: The progress of receiving the war zone is generally no longer a problem. On the part of the War Zone Receiving Committee, they only seek to complete the matter quickly and unload their responsibilities. Therefore, after the Dalian consultations, they urged the authorities to send personnel to receive the area as soon as possible. However, the provincial government believes that due to the relationship between political power and prestige, Li Jichun's troops are regarded as rebels. Before the puppet troops are assigned a designated area, if the provincial government rashly sends personnel to receive political power and the puppet troops come forward to make trouble, it will come into direct conflict with the provincial government, which would be detrimental to its prestige. However, the receiving committee believes that the Japanese side has already understood that the puppet troops dare not make trouble and that they should try to receive the area and not delay. Based on this view, the provincial government sent the county magistrates of Huairou, Jixian, Pinggu, Ninghe, and other counties to receive the area, but unfortunately, they were all rejected. Thereupon, Xue Zhiheng, Lei Shourong, Li Zeyi, and others worked hard on the reorganization of Li's troops. After several negotiations, a considerable decision was finally reached. The amount of all expenses was 348,000 yuan as rumored in Pingjin and 484,000 yuan as rumored in Tangshan. We outsiders have yet to understand. Since the reorganization issue has been properly settled, the method of receiving administrative power has also been changed, and it has been decided to proceed from difficult to easy. Song Naigan was ordered to go to Tangshan on the 22nd to receive the Public Security Bureau. Song and Li have a historical origin in the military world (during Li Jinglin's governorship of Zhili, Li Jichun was the commander of the 7th Division, and Song Naigan was the brigade commander in the 7th Division). The reception seems to be easier, but it was delayed until the 24th before it could be received. At the time of the change of power, Li actually sent a representative, Zhang Shouxian, to deliver a speech in the name of the Chairman of the Reorganization Committee. After the reception of Tangshan, the Receiving Committee immediately decided on the receiving steps and set off in two routes, northeast and south. Those belonging to the northern route, the county magistrates and public security chiefs of Miyun, Zunhua, Jixian, Huairou, and Pinggu, gathered in Beiping on the 24th and were led by Receiving Commissioner Tao Shangming to Ningyun on the 25th to contact the commander of the Suzuki Brigade before heading to receive the area in different routes. Those belonging to the eastern route, the county magistrates and public security chiefs of Ninghe, Yutian, Fengrun, Luanxian, Leting, Qian'an, Lulong, Funing, Changli, and Linyu, were also scheduled to go to Tangshan on the 24th, and the Receiving Committee prepared a letter of introduction to contact Li Jichun. At the same time, they urged the provincial government to quickly organize two detachments (4,600 men) of the War Zone Security Team and assign them to various counties to accompany the county magistrates to receive the area. However, Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong believes that the reception of political power focuses on substance rather than form. If the reception can be done smoothly, then not a single soldier is needed. If there are disputes, even if an armed security team is brought along, the reception cannot be forcibly carried out. Even if the reception is forcibly carried out, the political power cannot be exercised in the future. However, the Receiving Committee has already passed this resolution, so it is not convenient to deny it. Therefore, it was decided to first establish one detachment, appointing Xi Zhezhe (Zi Guangdian) as the detachment commander, with a total of more than 1,800 men, with one company stationed in each county, and the detachment headquarters located in Tangshan. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 26th, a telegram suddenly came from Tangshan, stating that "Li's troops are to be reorganized locally and cannot be concentrated at the designated locations (i.e., Fengrun and Luanxian). Receiving personnel in various counties, please do not bring too many security teams other than the security team for personal protection to avoid misunderstandings. The situation in Qian'an County is complicated and there are many bandits. The Japanese troops in the county have not been ordered to withdraw and refuse to receive the area. Please postpone the trip of the county magistrate of the county, Lu Qingchen, for the time being." After Receiving Commissioner Yin Tong received the telegram, he went to see Chairman Yu to explain everything. Yu was deeply suspicious and said that since there were still so many twists and turns, it would be best to postpone the reception until Li's troops were concentrated at the designated locations and all obstacles in the various counties were completely cleared before proceeding with the reception. Yin said that the reception was no longer a problem and that it was only to prevent any misunderstandings that the departing personnel were ordered to bring fewer security teams. Currently, only Qian'an could not be received and that continued negotiations would be held. After consultation, it was decided that the county magistrates would still depart according to the scheduled time limit, with only four companies of security teams temporarily dispatched, a total of 608 men, led by the detachment commander Dou Xizhe, with two companies stationed in Linyu County and one company each in Fengrun and Luanxian Counties. Yin Tong was deeply afraid that Chairman Yu would not order the receiving personnel to depart at the appointed time, so he went to Beiping by special train at 2:00 p.m. on the 26th to report to Huang Fu. At 6:00 p.m., Huang immediately ordered the provincial government by long-distance telephone to send personnel to depart and receive the area according to the scheduled steps. Receiving personnel in each county were only allowed to carry a small number of guards, and the rest of the security teams that had already been formed were to postpone their departure. Therefore, at 3:30 a.m. and 4:30 a.m. today (27th), two special trains departed from the East Station, with only two companies of security teams, fully armed, and with several machine guns attached, to protect the departing receiving personnel. According to Yu Shengxi, "Fengrun County Magistrate Zhang Renli went to Tangshan on the 24th to make contact and has not yet returned to Tianjin. Yesterday morning (26th), Li sent personnel to accompany him to receive the area, so there should be no problem. The reception of Qian'an has been postponed, and it is said that the situation is complicated, but I do not know exactly how complicated it is. Japanese soldiers at the major stations from Tangshan to Yuguan are reportedly temporarily refusing to withdraw on the pretext of the Boxer Protocol, which violates the spirit of the Tanggu Agreement. Further negotiations will be needed in the future. There are 6,000 to 7,000 soldiers of the Japanese army's Hattori Brigade stationed in Yuguan, and there is no news of their withdrawal. In my opinion, they may again use the excuse of being the puppet state's security force. The situation in Linyu is also very complicated. Although Receiving Commissioner Liu Shisun has sent a telegram reporting that there are no problems, there are a large number of Japanese and Korean ronin there, so the negotiations in the future cannot be underestimated. Therefore, Liu Shaokun, the secretary of the provincial capital's public security bureau, has also been additionally assigned to accompany the county magistrate Yin Shousong on his departure. The Japanese army's sentry line in Yuguan is in the Shihe area, which is what the Japanese side considers to be the puppet state's security line. It is also reported that the puppet state has been working hard to appease bandits in various places outside the customs and secretly transporting them into the customs. Recently, many bandits have been lurking in the Chaoyangdong, Jiaoshan, Shimen, and Yiyuan Pass areas north of Linyu County. In the future, it will be very difficult for us to suppress them, and they may flee in our direction. The provincial government has remitted 25,000 yuan for Li Jichun's troops' food and supplies for July, and they have recently demanded their salaries for July (said to be 48,000 yuan), which I have rejected. Regarding the salaries of the troops, they must wait until the reorganization is completed and the provincial government sends personnel to verify the number before they can be officially paid. Li's request for 8,000 yuan per month for the expenses of the Chairman's Office of the Reorganization Committee must also be approved by the standing committee of the provincial government before it can be determined. In addition, it is said that 6,000 of Li's troops who are surplus after the reorganization will be transported by the Beining Railway Bureau to Machang on the Jinpu Railway for dissolution. Most of the troops are from outside the customs and are bandits and vagrants from outside the customs. Now, instead of being transported outside the customs for dissolution, they are being transported to Machang in Hebei Province for dissolution. These people have nowhere to go and will inevitably become bandits in the future. The war-torn Ji Province will have these thousands of unemployed vagrants, and the local security is a cause for concern." The first train of 1,200 of Li's surplus troops arrived at Machang at 12:00 last night and were not allowed to disembark. The matter has been reported to the Military Affairs Commission in Beiping for instructions on resettlement measures. (July 27)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Zheng Guilin's Troops Mutiny <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Zheng's Troops Have Poor Discipline</p>
<p>Heard That They Will Go to Chahar After the Mutiny</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Tianjin: Zheng Guilin gained a good reputation last year for resisting Japan outside the customs, but the elements of his troops were bad and their discipline was poor. However, because he raised the banner of resistance against Japan, everyone concealed his misdeeds. This year, when Rehe Province fell, Zheng also led his troops into the customs after many twists and turns. The Beiping Military Affairs Commission gave him a monthly maintenance fee of 20,000 yuan and assigned him to the command of He Guozhu. In reality, He was also unable to control him. This summer, when Tangshan fell, Zheng's troops retreated to the territory of Ninghe County, where they committed kidnapping, extortion, rape, arson, and murder, committing all kinds of evil. The dozens of villages, large and small, within 50 to 60 li around them were reduced to scorched earth. The degree of suffering cannot be described in words. At that time, the local gentry repeatedly appealed for the disarming of the troops, and Yu Xuezhong consulted He Zhuguo's opinion. He said that the Military Affairs Commission was still tolerant and gave them 20,000 yuan per month, so why should we play the role of an evil person? Later, the Military Affairs Commission gave Zheng the nominal title of Provisional First Division Commander and sent him to Machang for training. Unexpectedly, he did not change his wild nature. After arriving at Machang, he still went out to cause trouble and was not subject to restraint. Zheng was still not satisfied and appointed a certain person as the Second Division Commander and recruited troops in Anci and other counties. The matter was learned by the First Army Corps and they were ordered to disband. Last week, Zheng's troops stationed at Machang mutinied twice, with 500 to 600 people looting the station and seriously injuring the stationmaster. Finally, Zheng was held hostage by his subordinates and the entire unit mutinied and fled. They first captured Renqiu County and extorted tens of thousands of yuan. It is said that they will flee to Chahar Province. The troops still have more than 2,000 men. After passing through Hejian, Lixian, Suning, and other counties, all villages and towns were looted, and the guns of the militias and police were confiscated. The local losses were extremely heavy. In addition to sending two battalions of infantry from the 114th Division of the First Army Corps and two companies of cavalry from Zhang Chengde to pursue and suppress the troops, the First Army Corps also telegraphed the garrisons in various counties to encircle and suppress them strictly. It is expected that they will be put down soon. (July 27)</p>
<h3 id="e94">The Jiangxi Bandits Invade Xunwu Again <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Scattered by Five Routes of Encirclement and Suppression by Various Armies</p>
<p>The Bandits Invading Shibanwei Also Suffered Heavy Losses</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the Southern Route bandit suppression army arrived in Xunwu, Anyuan, and other places, it has been actively deployed and advanced. Unexpectedly, taking advantage of the fact that the official army's forward deployment was not prepared, the communist bandits suddenly gathered 5,000 to 6,000 people from Ruijin and Huichang on the 16th of this month and launched a fierce attack on Xunwu. The Xunwu garrison's 8th Division's battalions of Ouyang Xin and Chen Fengshao fought fiercely separately, holding their ground for a day and night. The 7th Division of the Southern Route Army immediately rushed to their aid, while the Independent 1st Division and the 4th Division of Southern Jiangxi also separately outflanked the bandit positions. After a day and night of bloody fighting with five routes encircling the bandits, the bandits were defeated and scattered towards Peixi and Gaopai, north of Xunwu, gathering in the Junmenling area. The Southern Route Army has now ordered the aircraft units on the northeast routes to take off and reconnoiter and bomb the bandit areas. Ao Lun, the deputy captain of the 5th Air Unit in Meixian, Eastern Guangdong, has already led four aircraft to take off and take on the task of bombing the bandit areas of Junmen and Huichang. Tao Zuode, the captain of the 3rd Air Unit in Northern Guangdong, also led two aircraft from Shaozhou on the 20th and moved to Longnan to take on the task of reconnoitering and bombing the bandit nests near Anyuan. On the 18th, the defense area of the Yan Brigade of the Independent 1st Division was again invaded by more than 700 bandits, who split into groups to disturb the Luoxuan military line of our army. The brigade immediately dispatched three artillery companies to suppress the bandits. After about five hours of fighting, the bandits increased their reinforcements by more than 300 and advanced to Changgengwei, disturbing the rear of the brigade. Brigade Commander Yan again dispatched Chen Shuyau's battalion to attack. The bandits' plan failed and they gradually retreated towards Chishaling, killing more than 400 bandits along the way, capturing a communist bandit daredevil captain Yuan Guangzu and more than a dozen male and female bandits, and seizing 20 local rifles and one local cannon. At present, the 2nd Column of Eastern Jiangxi is preparing considerable forces for defense because the military situation in Junmen and Xunwu is still tense. The 1st Column has also engaged in fighting in Anyuan and Southern Jiangxi in recent days while searching for remnants of the communists. On the 10th of this month, a bloody battle occurred in Shibanwei near Anyuan, in which Chen Jing's troops of the 12th Regiment of the 4th Division engaged in hand-to-hand combat eight times with more than 4,000 bandits, and in the final counterattack, more than 1,000 bandits were killed or wounded, leaving behind more than 400 corpses. The official army suffered casualties of six platoon leaders and more than 30 soldiers. On the 17th of this month, the 4th Division dispatched Kong Kequan's battalion of the 10th Regiment to advance towards Longbu and encountered the communist bandit pseudo-Red Guard 12th Regiment in Tianxinwei. They fought for one night, and Huang Zhenbiao, the 10th company commander of the Kong Battalion, led his troops to be the first to break through the bandit positions, and the bandit troops retreated in disarray towards Huichang. The 10th Regiment entered Tianxinwei on the same day. The division has promoted Huang, the company commander, to the third battalion commander of the 10th Regiment in recognition of his bravery in killing the enemy in this battle.</p>
<p>On the 12th, Li Chonggang's battalion of the 5th Regiment of the 2nd Division of the 1st Army south of Ganzhou searched the Meirenkeng and Zhongcun areas from Huangni Pai and encircled a bandit gang of about 20 or 30 local communists. After the encirclement and suppression, they captured a communist bandit named Huang in the forest and seized a red flag of the Xinfeng Guerrilla Company of the Chinese Soviet. On the 14th, more than 400 Red Army soldiers of the 24th Division were found in Xintianwei. Ye Gengchang's regiment of the 2nd Division, stationed in Gupo, dispatched a company to suppress them on the 15th. The bandits stubbornly resisted from the high ground of Xintianwei and relied on solid fortifications. They engaged in a fierce battle with the official army on the 16th for several hours. The bandits were defeated only after the official army destroyed the bandit bunkers with artillery fire. More than 30 bandits were killed and several guns were seized. (July 24)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Regulations for Opium Prohibition in Guangxi Province <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Those Who Use Opium Are Required to Quit in Three Stages</p>
<p>Opium Dens Prohibited Starting in October</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangxi’s Kunlian and Qianwen Yingli areas are convenient for transportation, so many Guangxi people use opium. Recently, the Guangxi Provincial Government, recognizing the increasing harm of opium, designated special opium and gambling zones in various counties. Areas outside these special zones are strictly prohibited. Recently, the Provincial Government announced regulations for opium prohibition throughout the province, instructing all counties to implement them. The regulations are as follows: (1) Opium prohibition in Guangxi Province, except where otherwise stipulated by criminal law and special laws, shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of these regulations. (2) In areas with Public Security Bureaus, the prohibition of opium shall be the responsibility of the Public Security Bureau. In areas without Public Security Bureaus, it shall be the responsibility of the county government. (3) Each county government or Public Security Bureau shall be responsible for supervising its subordinate district, township, village, street, and neighborhood leaders to determine the number of opium users within its jurisdiction within one and a half months from July 1, 1933, and to compile a detailed list for reporting to the Provincial Government for review. The form for this list will be determined separately. (4) If the district, township, village, street, and neighborhood leaders conduct inaccurate investigations or arbitrarily fill out reports, they will be investigated and punished by the county magistrate or Public Security Bureau chief upon discovery. (5) Each county government or Public Security Bureau lecture hall should print flyers in simple language, send personnel to various streets and villages to promote and persuade, and instruct each school to organize lecture teams during holidays to go out and give lectures, so that the people deeply understand the harm of opium use and are determined to quit. (6) All opium users, regardless of gender or age, must quit by the end of July 1933. Those who cannot quit after three months must obtain a monthly opium use license and pay a license fee to be allowed to use opium. The license form will be determined and issued separately. (7) Opium users obtaining an opium use license shall pay the license fee in three-month installments. The first installment is one yuan per month, the second installment is two yuan per month, and the third installment is four yuan per month. If, after the third installment, they have not yet quit or use opium privately without a license, they will be punished according to law. (8) Those over 60 years of age or who use opium due to illness, as certified by a doctor, may obtain an opium use license and report to the Provincial Government for record on a monthly basis. (10) Opium users who are able to quit during the prohibition period must have two or more neighborhood leaders from their village or street issue a certificate stating that they will never use opium again, and submit it to the county government or Public Security Bureau for compilation and monthly submission to the Provincial Government for record. (11) Opium users who have quit may still be inspected at any time if necessary. (12) All opium dens in the cities and counties shall be prohibited from opening, starting from October 1, 1934.

<h3 id="e96">Resolutions of the Jiaoji Railway Council on the Method of Redeeming the Railway <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Allocate Annual Savings to Form a Railway Redemption Fund</p>
<p>Raise Domestic Public Bonds to Cover the Shortfall</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Jiaoji Railway Council held a meeting in the railway conference hall at 10:00 AM on July 24th. The attendees included Chairman Wang Zhengting, Councilors Yan Deqing, Ge Guangting, Chen Yanwen, and Council Secretary Zhao Cisheng. Chairman Wang Zhengting presided, and Zhao Citseng recorded the minutes. The meeting proceeded as planned, with the following items: Reporting Items: (omitted) Discussion Items: (1) Proposal to allocate the railway's annual savings to establish a railway redemption fund. (Explanation) The railway currently owes the national treasury 40 million Japanese yen in bonds. With less than five years remaining until the prescribed repayment deadline, it is appropriate to make arrangements as soon as possible to uphold national credit. After careful review of the railway's economic situation and revenue and expenditure status, it is proposed to raise 2 million Japanese yen annually starting in 1933. Within five years, the railway can repay at least 10 million yen of the bond principal. The remaining shortfall will be covered by raising domestic public bonds or seeking loans from domestic banking syndicates to settle the debt. Whether this is appropriate is respectfully submitted for public resolution. Resolution: Passed in principle, to be submitted to the ministry for record. (2) Proposal to gradually complete the replacement of the 85-pound steel rails east of Zhangdian Station. (Explanation) The railway previously used British Boxer Indemnity funds to purchase 85-pound steel rails to replace the light rails from Chengyang west to the Dawei River. This work is nearing completion. However, the railway's heavy-load cars all originate from Zhangdian. The section from the Dawei River to Zhangdian should also be replaced with heavy rails to increase speed and improve driving efficiency. The remaining funds from the railway's British Boxer Indemnity loan are sufficient to handle this project. It is proposed to replace them in stages. It is respectfully submitted for public resolution. Resolution: Passed. (3) Proposal to pilot the improvement of agricultural and forestry industries along the railway line to expand production. (Explanation) The land along the railway line is fertile and rich in resources. However, due to the people's lack of scientific knowledge, they tend to adhere to ancient methods for various production industries, with little improvement. Railways in Western countries often provide guidance and equipment for production industries along their lines, which benefits both parties. The railway intends to follow this example and plans to request several plots of wasteland from the Shandong Provincial Department of Construction to be used as forest farms, promoting afforestation. It also plans to subsidize Qilu University with a certain amount of funds each month, requesting its specialized professors to lead students in studying the points that should be improved in the agricultural products along the railway line for guidance. Whether this is appropriate is respectfully submitted for public resolution. Resolution: Passed in principle, to be handled by the railway bureau itself by formulating concrete measures.

<h3 id="e97">Sudden Rise in the Si River in Shandong <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Sharp Rise in the Upper Reaches of the Yellow River</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Continuous rainy weather in southern Shandong has caused mountain torrents and a sharp rise in the water level of various rivers. The Si River has risen sharply by 2.78 meters. The East Si River has already exceeded its highest water level and is still rising. Therefore, not only is the East Si River, which is under construction and dredging, affected, causing delays in the work, but the sharp rise in water may also lead to flooding disasters. After receiving a report from the Si River supervisor Zhao Dongsheng from Jining yesterday, the Department of Construction has telegraphed each county along the Si River to strictly prevent flooding disasters.</p>
<p>The upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yellow River have risen by 5-6 centimeters in recent days. The water source in the upper reaches is very strong and unusually abundant. According to a telegram received by the provincial government from Shaanxi Chairman Shao Lizhi on the 20th, as reported by Pingmin County Magistrate Mao Hanwen, the Yellow River has risen, and on the 10th, the Fengjia Village north of Yongji County in Shanxi Province was breached. The floodwaters flowed south, directly impacting the west gate of Pingmin County, destroying more than twenty dams. The area between the east gate of Yongji County and the west gate of Pingmin County became a flooded area, and all the crops were submerged. The provincial government believes that the Yellow River has risen very high this year. Now that it has breached in Shanxi, Shandong, located in the lower reaches, should also take practical precautions. It has ordered the River Affairs Bureau to be strictly vigilant about the rise in water in the upper reaches. The River Affairs Bureau has notified all its officers and soldiers. Today (26th),</p>
<p>The water level at Dongzhuang in the upper reaches of the Yellow River has risen by 2.3 centimeters, with a water level of 58.15 meters. The water level at Luokou in the middle reaches has risen by 0.3 centimeters, with a water level of 29.86 meters. The water level at Damajia in the lower reaches has risen by 0.16 centimeters, with a water level of 14.32 meters. The water level is still rising. (26th)</p>

At the appointed time, they all went to the station to greet him. The police band played music to welcome him. Public Security Director Shen, the head of the First District, Zhong, and Director Li of the Property Disposal Office were also accompanied by Inspector Jin to meet him. They then proceeded to the Inspector's Office for rest and talked with Inspector Jin and the county magistrates about important matters.

<p>Around 8:00 PM on the night before (27th), nine salt boats belonging to the Liuhe Salt Guild, carrying over 10,000 packages of salt, were unloading at Yaojiaqiao, Dantu, Zhenjiang. When they arrived at Xiangcheng Town, the first eight boats successively arrived at Xiangcheng Town for the night. The last boat, carrying 1,050 packages of salt, arrived later and was anchored on the Dongxiang River, near Yangcheng Lake, six li from the town. Unexpectedly, around 11:00 PM, two bandit boats in the style of Changshu rice boats, carrying more than 30 bandits from Dongchao Lake and other gangs, all dressed in short white summer cloth shirts and yellow cloth pants, with four box cannons and more than ten rifles, approached. They robbed more than 300 packages of salt (each package worth about six yuan)</p>
<p>and injured the boat owner, Zhi Zhenfu, and four other crew members, before shouting and leaving. The injured are currently being treated at Xiangcheng Hospital. On the other hand, the Salt Guild has dispatched Zhang from Taicang to the Xiangcheng District Office to investigate and has telegraphed the Wu County Government to send a team to pursue and suppress the bandits.</p>

<p>Quan Bingzhang, who resided at No. 1 Jiaxiang Lane, was formerly a struggling bill poster at a police station. Later, he suddenly became the chief of a section in the Hebei Department of Finance, and became wealthy. He had one wife and two concubines. After the September 18th Incident last year, he moved to Suzhou with his family. Conflicts often arose between the wife and concubines. A week ago, his wife reported to the Public Security Bureau that Quan was privately hiding military weapons. The police bureau sent police to search and arrest him, and indeed found two pistols. He was arrested and later released on bail. As a result, family disputes increased. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 27th, his second concubine, Tan, suddenly committed suicide by swallowing opium. Quan Bingzhang and his wife left that night and have not returned. The police precinct in charge reported to the District Prosecutor's Office, which dispatched personnel on the 28th to examine and collect the body. They also issued a summons for Quan Bingzhang to investigate everything.</p>

<p>Due to changes in discount rates, the local rice and bean industry has</p>
<p>experienced disputes. After more than a month of stalemate, the situation has become deadlocked. In order to resolve the issue, the County Business Association invited representatives of the eight rice industry segments to a meeting for mediation and proposed a compromise solution of 98.7%. A formal letter was sent to the Rice and Bean Industry Association to discuss and handle the matter properly. After receiving the letter, the association convened a joint meeting yesterday. Only representatives from the Beitang and Huangniqiao segments attended, while no one from the Sanliqiao segment attended. In addition, Chairman Zhao Zixin also did not attend, resulting in a failed meeting with no results. Meanwhile, the Sanliqiao segment, due to a sudden change in the discount rate, also convened an emergency meeting. It was decided that the previous resolution to change the discount rate to 98.4% was being ignored by Maomao and five other companies, who were disregarding the interests of their fellow traders, causing unnecessary complications, and arbitrarily distorting the reasons. In this situation, what order can be maintained? The case is being treated as a child's play, and the public notice is just a formal document, but the association has no way to impose sanctions. The atmosphere at the meeting was tense, and everyone expressed dissatisfaction. It was decided to temporarily withdraw from the association. Currently, the association, recognizing the escalating situation of the discount dispute, has dispatched representative Qian Nianxiu to contact and mediate with the Sanliqiao segment. It is also rumored that some industry insiders want to overturn the 99% discount, the 98.4% discount, and the 98.7% discount, and implement the 98.6% discount.</p>

<p>Since the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau officers used the excuse of arresting gamblers to disturb Loshe Town, causing a town-wide strike, the aftermath has not yet subsided. Yesterday, five or six plainclothes policemen from the Eighth Brigade of the Seventh District Zhangjingqiao Town and seven or eight armed policemen with loaded guns came to the town to arrest gamblers. However, at that time, it was the time for shops to open, and the villagers had no time to gamble. Therefore, the plainclothes policemen searched each teahouse without any gain. Then they went straight to the room of Fang Asi in the Anan teahouse to search, but still found nothing. Finally, they went to the Zhao Asan teahouse and found a set of discarded mahjong tiles that had already been scattered in the cupboard. The policemen believed that they had obtained the stolen goods. However, lacking gamblers, they detained Zhao Quanguan, a villager who was shopping there, and took him to the bureau. Zhao protested his wrongful detention and argued with them, but was brutally beaten by the policemen and seriously injured. At that time, the shops and villagers in the town, seeing this, were shocked and told each other, and for a time the crowd was noisy and the order was chaotic. The district chief of the district, Ying Qiu, heard the news and came to the town to mediate. Zhao Quanguan, feeling aggrieved by the wrongful beating, planned to appeal to the court for a medical examination, but was persuaded by Zhao, the district chief, who said that he would negotiate with the Huang branch bureau chief before making a decision. Zhao Quanguan then followed the order and went home. The policemen also returned to the bureau together. It is not known how this storm will end.</p>

The leaders of the case, Kuai Liu Mazi and Chen Xiao Erzi, were recently captured by the Yixing County Government. They confessed to robbing and injuring people. Wu Jia, the county magistrate of Yixing, came to Changzhou the day before yesterday and reported the matter to Cai Pei, the special commissioner of the Second District. Commissioner Cai immediately instructed that the criminals be escorted to Changzhou for interrogation and dispatched an armed team to escort them on the 27th.

<p>The Jiangdu County Government previously arrested Wang Chonggui, a bandit involved in the kidnapping of Chen Detang in Rongshou Township, Sixth District, as reported by the police team. After interrogation, he confessed that he had followed Wang Laowu (i.e., Wang Diankui), who lived in Xinjiekou, Nanjing, to kidnap Chen Detang with a gun, intending to extort a ransom, and that he had guarded the hostage together with him. After County Magistrate Ma Jian reported the case to the Capital Police Department, Wang Laowu was arrested and brought to justice. After summoning and examining the victim in court, the case was referred to the provincial government for review. The provincial government then issued a confidential telegram approving the death penalty for the bandit Wang Laowu. The prisoner was identified and escorted to the execution ground behind Tianningmen at 11:00 AM today (27th) for execution by firing squad.</p>

<p>The water level in the upper reaches of the Jiangbei Grand Canal is becoming increasingly tense, exceeding the new record of 1.7 zhang. On the morning of the 27th, the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau reported that the Qingjiangpu main gate was at 2 zhang due to the rapid rise in the Huai River. If it continues to rise, the lives and property of the residents along the canal will be at risk. Fortunately, the water level in the Jiangdu section is still stable, with the San Gou Gate measuring 1.11 zhang. The Gaobao section reported that the Yuma dedication water level has only risen by 1 cun, so the downstream panic is less severe than in the upstream.</p>

<p>The Garrison Headquarters Will Not Be Abolished</p>
<p>The Successor Has Not Been Determined, Temporarily Handled by Zhang Xiang</p>
<p>After Relinquishing His Position, Dai Plans to Travel to North China</p>
<p>Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji was recently ordered by the Central Government to serve as a member of the Fujian Provincial Government and concurrently as the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. After receiving the order, Dai went to Gan to pay respects to Chairman Chiang in order to personally inquire about everything. He completed his official duties on the morning of the day before (27th) and took a boat to Nanjing. After landing in Nanjing, he immediately changed to the Shanghai-Nanjing express train that afternoon and returned to the North Station at 0:30 yesterday morning. Yesterday morning, the reporter visited Dai at the Garrison Headquarters, inquired about the process of meeting with Chiang, the issue of the existence of the Garrison Headquarters, and when he would go to Fujian to take office. He replied as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e117">Meeting with Chiang <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Dai said, "I had previously submitted my resignation to the Central Government</p>
<p>repeatedly, but it was not approved. Later, I received a telegram from Chairman Chiang summoning me, so I went to Nanchang a few days ago to pay my respects and inquire about everything. When I arrived in Nanchang, Chairman Chiang had just left for Guling, so I changed my route to Lu to pay my respects. I was instructed by Chairman Chiang to go to Fujian as soon as possible. When I paid my respects, Chairman Chiang was very busy, so the time for our talk was very short. Regarding the</p>

<p>issue, there was no mention. However, I believe that Shanghai is an important area for national defense, and the Garrison Headquarters is still necessary. I have not heard of the rumors that it will be abolished.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Successor <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the successor to the Songhu Garrison Commander, it has not yet been decided. When I met with Chairman Chiang, I asked who would succeed me. Chairman Chiang said that no one has been appointed yet. Before the successor is announced, all the duties of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters will be temporarily handled by the Chief of Staff of the department, Zhang Xiang. It is expected that the successor will be officially announced soon. I am now instructing the staff of this department to expedite the handover procedures so that I can relinquish my position when the successor is announced.</p>

<p>After leaving school in 1915, I joined the army and have had no time to rest. I have not been to various places in North China for more than ten years. Now, I plan to take some time to travel to various places in North China after the handover here and when the January 28th Memorial Hall is completed, and then go to Fujian to take office. As for the duties in Fujian Province, Chairman Jiang is currently responsible for them, so it is okay to arrive a little later. However, I must go to take office by the end of next month at the latest.</p>

Last night, a reporter from the Central News Agency met him at the new customs wharf and conducted the following interview: (Q) What is your mission on this trip to Guangdong? (A) This time I returned to Guangdong to take care of personal matters and have no other mission. (Q) How will Commander-in-Chief Chen deal with the Haiqi, Zhaohua, and Haichen ships that have defected to Guangdong? (A) The Haiqi and other ships have now been incorporated into the Southern Route Headquarters. (Q) To what extent has the Southern Route Bandit Suppression military progress been made? (A) The Southern Route Bandit Suppression troops have all been dispatched to actively suppress the bandits. However, various issues such as the aftermath of the bandit areas are quite cumbersome, so the progress is relatively slow. (Q) Is it true that you have brought two personal letters from Commander-in-Chief Chen, one to Chairman Chiang and the other to President Wang? (A) That is not true. (Q) Will you go to Nanjing in the next few days and then to Lushan to pay respects to Chairman Chiang? (A) I will go to Nanjing in the next few days and then to Lushan to avoid the heat. I will also pay respects to Chairman Chiang along the way.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, and his wife recently accompanied Madam Lu Qing, Sun’s mother, to Qingdao to escape the summer heat. Mr. Sun, together with Yu Ming, the Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Pu'an" ship back to Shanghai yesterday. Madam Sun, however, will remain in Qingdao with Madam Lu to escape the summer heat and will return south after the autumn cools down. The "Pu'an" ship arrived in Shanghai at about 4 p.m. yesterday, docking at the Hua Zhan pier in Pudong. After disembarking, Mr. Sun immediately transferred to a small boat and landed at the New Customs Wharf, returning directly to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest. Those who went to the wharf to welcome him included Yang Hu, Director of the Security Bureau; Li Zhao Huan, President of Jiaotong University; Huang Hanliang, former Minister of Finance; Zhao Tie Zhang, Section Chief of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and reporters from news agencies, totaling more than ten people. Mr. Sun's return to Shanghai this time was in response to an invitation by telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to go to Lushan to confer with important government officials. After returning to Shanghai yesterday, Mr. Sun received two urgent telegrams from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, urging him to hasten his journey to Lushan. Mr. Sun is scheduled to take the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Hankou flight at 8 a.m. this morning, together with Yu Ming, and fly to Jiujiang, from where they will transfer to Lushan to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek.

<p>To Rescue the Declining Rural Economy</p>
<p>To Curb Dumping and Maintain the National Foundation</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, in order to rescue the declining rural economy and maintain the national foundation, yesterday sent a special telegram to the central government requesting an increase in the import tax on foreign rice. The original telegram reads: "To the Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ministry of Finance Ministry of Industry, Upon receiving a letter from the Zhangpu County Chamber of Commerce in Fujian, we found that Zhangpu was originally a rice-producing area, and the rural economy relied entirely on the export of rice to provide funding. However, this year, due to the impact of foreign rice dumping, not only has the export route been cut off, but the local market has also been occupied by foreign rice, resulting in the risk of spoilage. The rural economy is also on the verge of bankruptcy. If Zhangpu, a remote small county, has suffered so much, the impact on other rice-producing areas is self-evident. If no measures are taken to curb dumping, the future of our country's rural areas will be unimaginable. Therefore, we request that you investigate and forward this to the central government, and impose a heavy import tax on foreign rice to curb its dumping, in order to maintain the production of farmers across the country. This is truly a matter of public interest, etc. Upon approval of this, we find that the decline of our country's rural economy has various causes, but the drop in rice prices is the biggest key. The reason for the drop in rice prices is the impact of foreign rice dumping. Our country is based on agriculture, and agricultural products are sufficient for self-sufficiency. However, due to the squeezing of foreign rice dumping, the rural economy is in a state of bankruptcy. If no remedial measures are taken urgently, the danger is extremely great. The association, witnessing the difficulties of the times, requests that you immediately find a way to increase the import tax on rice to avoid surpluses and maintain the national foundation. This is our sincere plea. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, respectfully."</p>

<p>Already Forwarded to the Municipal Council for Deliberation</p>
<p>The city's budget for the 22nd year, which was previously ordered by the municipal government to be reported separately by its affiliated agencies, was assigned to Yu Hongjun, Cai Zengji, and others as members of the budget review committee. The committee has completed the review of the budgets of various agencies and submitted them to the mayor for approval. The mayor then presented them to the municipal affairs meeting, which approved them according to the review opinions and forwarded them to the municipal council for deliberation. It is understood that the total budget for this year is more than 12 million yuan. Once it is approved by the municipal council, it will be submitted to the central government for approval before it can be handled according to the new budget.</p>

<p>The regulations for the collection of land value tax and the organizational rules of the land value assessment committee in this city have been approved and promulgated by the Executive Yuan.

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the new coins minted by the Central Mint have already circulated on the market. The mint is currently only able to mint about 100,000 yuan per day due to the hot weather. Once the weather cools down, production can be increased. It is also understood that the dime coins circulating on the market are often subject to foreign exchange fluctuations, which increases the cost for small businesses. The banking industry in this city feels that it is necessary to improve this situation. Therefore, it has submitted the situation and suggestions to the Ministry of Finance for evaluation by the Central Mint to mint decimal silver subsidiary coins.</p>
<p>In addition, yesterday, the mayor separately appointed Hong Da, Section Chief of the Second Section of the Municipal Government; Yang Nianzu, Section Chief of the Second Section of the Land Bureau; Chen Jun, Section Chief of the Second Section of the Finance Bureau; Wu Huanru, Section Chief of the Second Section of the Social Affairs Bureau; and Xue Cixin, Section Chief of the First Section of the Public Works Bureau, as members of the land value tax land valuation committee.

<p>But Overseas Chinese Still Vigorously Oppose</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications originally planned to implement the Nanyang postage increase on May 1st. However, due to repeated opposition from overseas Chinese, it has been postponed again and again and has not yet been realized. According to news from the Postal Administration of the Ministry, the postal authorities have repeatedly considered the issue of increasing postage to Nanyang in order to make appropriate reductions. However, due to the postal economy, revenue has plummeted since the fall of the Northeast. At the same time, due to the gold price, the transmission of letters to Nanyang has always been a huge loss. Therefore, it has been decided to implement the price increase according to the original plan starting September 1st, with no further delays.</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, overseas Chinese in Nanyang are still vigorously opposing the Ministry of Communications' increase in postage and have telegraphed the Executive Yuan, urging the Ministry of Communications to rescind the price increase to avoid unfavorable feelings between overseas Chinese and the motherland. Therefore, it is not yet certain whether it can be implemented as scheduled on September 1st.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, according to sources in the banking industry in this port, the Ministry of Finance, in order to increase national treasury revenue, has been collecting a 1.25% paper money tax since last year.

It is calculated on an average basis at the end of each year and taxes are paid according to regulations. The Ministry of Finance has already started calculating the tax amount from July 1st last year to the end of June this year and will collect it from various banks at the beginning of next month, totaling about 3 million yuan. The total number of banknotes issued by various banks in this port last year is as follows: Bank of China more than 90 million yuan, Central Bank more than 45 million yuan, Bank of Communications more than 35 million yuan, the Four Banks more than 35 million yuan, Ningpo Commercial Bank more than 25 million yuan, China Industrial Bank more than 20 million yuan, Zhejiang Industrial Bank more than 7 million yuan, and Agricultural and Industrial Bank more than 2 million yuan, totaling more than 300 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e132">National Federation of Commerce Sends Telegram to Ministry of Finance Requesting Repeal of New Special Tax on Domestic Tobacco <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance yesterday to repeal the new special tax on domestic tobacco, stating: "To the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, Upon receiving a letter from the Jiujiang City Chamber of Commerce in Jiangxi, which states: "The Jiujiang Customs Transit Industry Association writes that the members of the association, including Li Hengmao, Gong Yuchang, Rishengdong, Yongda'an, Wanli, Wang Jinji, Hengshun, Shentai, Qianshengji, Ding Shen, Qingfeng, and other firms, state that our association has opened customs transit warehouses in Xun, relying on the tobacco leaf production in Ruijin, Guangchang, Poyang, Duchang, and Ruichang in Jiangxi, Suqian in Anhui, and Huangmei and Guangji in Hubei. Over the years, tobacco merchants have transported goods to Xun, and our association has acted as their customs broker and transit agent, and has also advanced customs duties and transportation fees. For small businesses, we have even had to provide them with loans to facilitate their turnover. Recently, due to sluggish business and tight finances, the tobacco leaves that have been pledged in Xun have not been transported for export because there is no money to repay the loans. However, these tobacco leaves all left the place of origin before the promulgation of the new regulations and have paid all the taxes and fees. Jiujiang is not a production area, so how can we force them to levy taxes again? Moreover, the new regulations were implemented on July 1st, and the tobacco leaves that have been in port for a long time are not within the scope of the new regulations. The law can still be lenient to the past, and we cannot make exceptional and harsh demands. In the past, the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau was also an agency established by the Ministry of Finance. Since the new regulations have been changed and have not been promulgated, the tobacco leaves that have completed the payment of taxes cannot be sold. Is this reasonable? If the place of origin tax bill is issued after the implementation of the new regulations and the required tax rate has not been paid, it should be paid by the Local Tobacco Special Tax Bureau, which is proper, and tobacco merchants have no objection. Now, under the pretext of the new regulations, they are forcibly collecting taxes on tobacco leaves that are unrelated, which is a direct pain for tobacco merchants due to heavy taxes, and our association is indirectly affected by the depletion of business. Having no other choice, we have described the situation and request that your association forward it to the Jiujiang Local Tobacco Special Tax Bureau to release the stored tobacco leaves in accordance with the regulations, and not make things difficult for the sake of public order and to maintain commerce. It is also found that the Tax Administration has changed the tobacco and alcohol tax rates for this year, abolished the public sale, and issued new regulations with harsh clauses and heavy fines. Tobacco merchants everywhere are generally pessimistic, resulting in the stagnation of tobacco transportation, and our industry is becoming more and more deserted. However, Article 2 of the new regulations stipulates that each market scale of 100 catties will be levied 4 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen in national currency. The tobacco leaves produced in the above-mentioned eight counties of Ruijin and other counties are mostly of inferior quality, and the selling price is only 2 yuan to 4 yuan per 100 catties. Buyers are all tobacco shops, who sell silk for sale, and the smokers are also coolies and common people. Now, the tax rate is higher than the selling price, which is directly added to tobacco merchants and indirectly added to coolies. In recent years, disasters have occurred frequently, and the countryside has gone bankrupt. Tobacco merchants must seek other livelihoods in view of the future. As for the tobacco-producing areas, most of them are barren mountains and sandy soil, where grains cannot be grown. Their lifeline is entirely tied to tobacco leaves. If they cannot be sold, their livelihoods will be cut off. If the tens of millions of poor people are about to fill the ditches, our government cherishes the people's livelihood. Your association, representing the merchants, respectfully requests that you forward all the above-mentioned obstructive circumstances to the Ministry of Finance, and humbly request that you take back your orders and collect taxes as before, so as to increase national taxes and relieve the people's sentiments, etc. The public association forwarded the letter to the association. According to this, in addition to reporting the section on completed tax fees, which will be handled separately, it is found that the tax rate is higher than the selling price, which is what the country and the people cannot bear. According to the previous situation, it is reasonable to forward it to your association and ask you to check and treat the obstruction of the new chapter, transfer the report, etc. Upon approval, it is reasonable to send a telegram to your ministry, humbly requesting a review and approval, and humbly considering the livelihood of the poor people, take back the order, and still collect taxes according to the old chapter, and order the Jiujiang Local Tobacco Special Tax Bureau to quickly release the goods that have arrived in Xun before and have been taxed according to the old chapter, in order to relieve merchants from difficulties. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, respectfully."</p>

The shipowner, Chuan Anxing, immediately stopped the ship to search. At that time, three people were rescued. Upon inquiry, it was learned that one was Fei Baozhong, 29 years old, who was the shipowner of the Jindeli ship; one was He Yongfu, 39 years old, who was the captain of the ship; and one was Tang Laichun, 19 years old, who was a partner of the ship. The Jindeli ship was carrying sand and mud from Qushan to Shanghai. At about 9:00 p.m. the night before, it sailed to the sea off Daji. Due to the adjustment of the wind gun, it was overturned by the wind. There were a total of nine people on the ship. Now, only three people have been rescued. The other six people cannot be found. They had no choice but to come to Shanghai at 1:15 a.m. yesterday. Now, the shipowner, Chuan Anxing, has reported the matter separately to the relevant authorities for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Ancient Artifacts of the Palace Museum Continued to be Inspected Yesterday <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Leather Clothing Shows Signs of Dampness</p>
<p>Will Attempt to Expose to Sunlight</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the ancient artifacts storage of the Palace Museum has been inspecting the items stored in the boxes for several days. The results show that there is no dampness or mold. The situation is very good. Yesterday, the Palace Museum Supervisory Committee continued to open the boxes for inspection in groups. A total of more than 50 boxes were inspected in the morning. The calligraphy, paintings, books, documents, and other items were still dry and free of mold. However, the boxes containing leather clothing showed signs of dampness, and it was feared that the valuable leather clothing would be damaged. They will attempt to expose it to sunlight. Yesterday afternoon, all groups stopped working and did not continue the inspection. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited a museum staff member yesterday afternoon. According to him, the Supervisory Committee will hold a meeting tomorrow (i.e., today) to discuss everything and decide on the issue of exposure to sunlight. Therefore, the inspection will not continue temporarily tomorrow. As for the expansion of the Supervisory Committee, it must wait for the Palace Museum Board of Directors to hold a meeting to decide. The meeting of the Board of Directors will have to be postponed until around August 20. The reporter then inquired about the whereabouts of Yu Tongkui, the former Director of General Affairs of the Palace Museum. According to the answer, Mr. Yu recently took leave to go to Qingdao, and the affairs here were entrusted to Section Chief Zhou Huanxuan to represent him. Mr. Yu will also go to Beiping from Qingdao in early August to handle the transfer procedures.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Shanghai Municipal Council States Purpose of Crackdown on Rubber Factories <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Forwarded the Letter to the Industry Association</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement sent a letter to the Rubber Products Industry Association yesterday to forward the reply from the Shanghai Municipal Council, stating: "Regarding the case of the Shanghai Municipal Council's notice to Hongda, Yiyuan, Dade, Tianxing, and other rubber products factories to relocate, we have received the following reply from the Council: "To the Rubber Industry Association regarding the letter of July 11, protesting against the implementation of the safety measures stipulated by the Council and requesting that the order be withdrawn, since the beginning of this year, there have been three incidents of carelessness in the rubber factories in the settlement. The first time was on February 21, when 81 workers died. The second time was on February 24, which occurred in one of the factories currently ordered to relocate. Fortunately, the fire occurred outside of working hours, otherwise the tragedy would have been far greater than the former, because there are 200 female workers in the factory, and the equipment of the Taiping Gate is completely inapplicable. The third time was on June 16. Fortunately, the dangerous part of the factory had been isolated, otherwise the casualties would have been inevitable. Because of the third incident of carelessness, the Council believes that this issue cannot be postponed any longer and issued an order on June 17 for the first time to all factories whose factory premises are unsuitable to stop work altogether. Your association believes that the Council can seek hygiene and safety without ordering the factories to relocate. The reason why the Council ordered the relocation of six factories is because, first, it is absolutely impossible to isolate the dangerous work areas in their current factory buildings, and second, the site cannot withstand heavy loads. The rubber factory is most likely to cause fire hazards, which is the refining of light oil, which is not in line with the facts. According to the explosion of rubber factories, there are two reasons: one is the use of naphtha, and the other is the debris in the calendering room. Among the five jobs in the factory, the amount of naphtha used may cause danger: one is the reconciliation of light oil, the second is the number of soaking light oil, the third is the reconciliation of cement, the fourth is the number of cloth cement, and the fifth is the rubber shoe pattern. Moreover, the air stored in the rubber vulcanizer contains explosive properties. If the electrical equipment in each factory ordered to be relocated emits sparks, it may cause an explosion throughout the factory at any time. As for the other 20 factories, they have not been ordered to relocate, because three of them only manufacture rubber products, which are less dangerous, and the remaining 17 have been shown improvement measures and have been asked to report the implementation time. The time limit set by the Council is never neglected. Even the hygiene and other safety equipment mentioned by your association will be gradually promoted according to their financial resources and time. The inspection of factories has been discussed with the municipal government in order to meet the wishes of the Chinese, in order to find a way that can be accepted by all parties. However, no matter what the outcome of the negotiations, the Council cannot abandon its responsibility for public safety related to buildings and factories within the settlement. According to the above, the Council has no other way but to promote this policy in order to protect the safety of citizens' lives and property. Correspondingly, I hereby inform you, and I hope you will check and take care of it. Sincerely, the Shanghai National Rubber Products Industry Association."</p>

<p>Russian Ambassador Has Not Yet Replied</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, after the Soviet Union took the lead in selling the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan and held a meeting, the Huashen Bank Liquidation Office in this port stated that most of the assets of the railway belonged to the bank. Therefore, as a creditor, it protested to the Soviet Russian Embassy in China and the Japanese Embassy, opposing the sale between Japan and Russia in the form of private transfer, and asked them to pay attention to the rights and interests of the creditor. Since the protests were sent separately, it is now learned that the Japanese Embassy has formally replied to the bank's liquidation office after receiving the protest, requesting that it be forwarded to the government for verification. The Russian Ambassador has been in Beijing for a long time, so he has not yet received a reply.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Ferry "Yangtze River" Collides with Floating Dock <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Slightly Damaged</p>
<p>According to the Tzu Lin Pao, the Yangtze River ferry between Xiaguan and Pukou was shipped from the United Kingdom to Shanghai on April 17. Because the dock in Nanjing was not yet completed, it was temporarily berthed near Chenjiazhui in the Huangpu River. Yesterday (26th), it sailed to the Jiangnan Shipyard to be repainted. When it sailed near the Longmao Dock in Pudong, due to the strong wind and rapid tide, the ship only had a draft of five feet. The huge ship was shallow, and it was stimulated by the waves, causing the bow of the ship to collide with the floating dock. The hull was also slightly damaged. It was then towed to the Fanan Shipyard by a tugboat in the evening and will stay in the dock for about two months before sailing to Nanjing.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Dr. Jiang Kanghu's Speech on the Situation in Canada <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Japanese People Publish Absurd Remarks in Canada</p>
<p>Jiang Repeatedly Spoke to Reprimand His Delusion</p>
<p>Dr. Jiang Kanghu, director of the Chinese Department of McGill University in Canada, gave a speech at the Bankers Club at the invitation of the International Issues Research Association at 5 pm the day before yesterday (27th). The following is a record of his speech (hereinafter, Jiang Jun's own words) Canada is north of the United States, with an area that is one-fifth larger than the United States, but its population accounts for only one-tenth of that of the United States. McGill University is located in Montreal, the capital of Kandong, and the city's population accounts for one-eighth of the country, which is also a strange thing. I have been in the United States and Canada for a total of eight years, and although I am engaged in the work of promoting Chinese culture, I can also say that I have a close relationship with international issues, because since the September 18th Incident, the tide of the Sino-Japanese issue has impacted the eyes and ears of the world. In order to understand the truth of the matter, people there often ask me to speak, averaging 70 to 80 times a year. However, in fact, it is quite difficult, because there is a lack of materials and talents. I have to interpret the newspapers. For example, the destruction of the Oriental Library Business Press has published declarations in the name of university professors, which were published in various newspapers. What is most hateful is that the Japanese people are very active in various places in the Americas and publish absurd remarks, such as referring to the 19th Route Army as a Red Army, and Manchuria is not Chinese territory. Its independence is the liberation of the nation, and for the sake of world peace, we have to protect Manchuria, and that a quarter of China's land has been completely occupied by the Red Army, and China has no ability to deal with this matter. Now that Manchuria has been established, the exchanges between China and Russia can be isolated from now on. This move is to directly help China to avoid the spread of the Red Army and indirectly seek world peace, etc. I have heard all these things with my own ears. As for the publications, there are already more than a dozen huge books published on the Manchurian side. There are two clubs in Montreal, Empire and Canadian, which are the most famous there (according to reports, Japan already has an embassy in Canada). They even asked the club to speak there, which shows how careful they are. Looking back at our government, it can be said that it has no work to promote abroad. Our country's propaganda there is only for a few students. In addition, there are incidental reports. Canada's immigration regulations have always been very strict. International students must have two years of university education to be admitted, and they are not allowed to work or practice there. Moreover, they must leave the country after graduation. Later, the director of the Immigration Bureau there asked me to review Chinese student affairs for the bureau, so I was able to dredge it up, and the conditions have been relaxed, that is, high school graduates can also go there, and they are allowed to work outside the school, but they must have at least ten credits per semester. After graduation, if they study science, they can also study in Canada without having to leave the country first. Those who want to study in Canada can contact me directly, etc. It is heard that Jiang Jun feels that the Chinese people are quite isolated from the situation in Canada, and plans to give more public speeches on a regular basis, focusing on Canada.</p>

<p>Lu Xingzhuang and Zhang Zilian, members of the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation, received a letter from Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry yesterday, which stated: "It is found that the Ministry's National Products Exhibition Hall has held the fourth annual exhibition, which has been ordered to be prepared.

<p>Xu Yong is Sent to the Ministry for Investigation</p>
<p>Based on Order No. 1458 from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, upon investigating that Zhang Renqing, claiming to be a member of the 88th Division's New Recruit Transportation Office in Shanghai for the Wenzhou and Taizhou regions of Zhejiang Province, led unarmed new recruits to occupy the Fuyou Road Coal Public Office without authorization, and ordering its immediate prohibition, immediately instructed the Second Precinct of the First District to notify the Transportation Office to comply. Now, the 88th Division Headquarters issued Official Letter No. 290, stating that the division's recruitment office established the Transportation Office in Shanghai to facilitate the transport of new recruits from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Chu prefectures. However, it was recently discovered that the office director, Xu Yong, was using the Transportation Office's name to conduct private recruitment, which violated the division's regulations on designated recruitment areas. Therefore, the recruitment director in Zhejiang was strictly ordered to immediately abolish the office, and the office director, Xu Yong, was sent to the ministry for investigation. The letter requests that the situation be investigated, and that if similar incidents occur in the future, strict measures should be taken to prohibit them. It is reported that the Municipal Public Security Bureau has been ordered to handle this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e142">The Fish Association's Office Will Hold a Representative Conference Today <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Jiangzhe Fish Industry Guild will convene a representative conference at 2 PM today. Representatives from Shaoxing and Wenjia (under Wuxing County) have already arrived and reported to the association yesterday. Representatives from Taizhou, Ningbo, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Wenzhou, Shipu (under Xiangshan County), Yuyao, Kunshan, and Zhenjiang are also en route to Shanghai, and are expected to arrive this morning. The conference agenda will include a report on the past disputes regarding fishery construction fees and the future policies to be adopted. Yesterday, the association also printed and distributed "The Opinions of the Third Mediator, with Original Text Attached," for distribution at the meeting. As it has not been previously published, it is transcribed below. Regarding the fishery construction fee case, after two rounds of mediation by He De and others, and after announcing the minister's sincerity in cooperating with the fishery industry to the representatives, the representatives were able to understand. However, they strongly criticized the misconduct of the collection personnel and the inadequate protection provided by the naval patrol ships. Regarding the construction fee itself, they also had several points that they insisted on requesting from the ministry. He De and others, after considering all opinions and adding their own suggestions, propose the following measures: 1. Shellfish are mostly sold in small quantities, and collecting fees seems excessively petty and the actual revenue is small, so it is proposed to exempt them. 2. Salted fish and seafood that have already paid customs duties should not be subject to construction fees again, as this is double taxation, so it is proposed to exempt them. 3. All frozen and salted fish that are subject to fees should be collected by the initial trading firm when they are first sold. For example, fish in barrels from Shenjiamen (under Dinghai County) should be collected by the fish firms in Shenjiamen. Once the fee is collected, it should not be collected again regardless of where the fish are transported. 4. To reduce collection costs and avoid harassment, it is proposed that the construction fee be determined separately by fish firms in various locations and remitted monthly. 5. Naval protection is of utmost importance and should be handled entirely by government authorities to avoid misunderstandings. It is proposed to establish a naval protection committee within the management bureau to allow merchant participation. Branch associations should also be established in Ningbo, Zhenhai, and Dinghai. The main duties include formulating naval protection plans and calculating naval protection expenses. 6. The existing various license fees and miscellaneous fees should be abolished by the ministry as soon as possible. 7. There is no need to establish a collection office. Previous funds (such as those for purchasing ships) should be returned by the ministry. The above items are only a general outline, and if they are adopted, the details will be discussed one by one for implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Record of the Yangzhou Fellow Association Meeting Regarding Zhu Shaotong's False Accusation <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Yangzhou Fellow Association held an executive committee meeting the day before yesterday, with 25 members present. Song Shixiang was elected chairman and the formalities were observed. Chen Qiannian reported that member Zhu Shaotong was employed at the Yifeng Porcelain Factory. On June 17th, he took leave to visit his relatives in Yangzhou. On the 28th, while passing by Hou'an Village, three thugs suddenly robbed Zhu of his watch and gown. (Shanghai slang: "peeling the pig's hide"). Zhu shouted and chased after them. When the thugs saw pedestrians, they knew they could not escape and instead grabbed Zhu, falsely claiming that they saw Zhu was the bandit who cut off the genitals of a child named Zheng. (At the time, there were rumors in Yangzhou about cutting off genitals.) When pedestrians heard this, they shouted and rushed forward, indiscriminately seizing Zhu and taking him to the local Public Security Bureau, falsely claiming that a child named Zheng had his genitals cut off. The bureau did not investigate and forced Zhu to confess under torture that he cut off the genitals of the child and sold them to a Shanghai pharmacy. Afterwards, the Zheng family went to the Public Security Bureau to declare that the child was safe at home and that nothing had happened. (Zheng also published a statement in the newspaper.) Then, Zhu was transferred to the county government, where he was still tortured and forced to confess to various unfounded facts. The president of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Jingting, knowing this rumor, strongly defended Zhu to the county magistrate, like cutting paper figures with hairstyles, and secured Zhu's release on bail. Zhu suffered injuries and humiliation and went to the court to have his injuries examined, which is still under investigation. Zhu is 24 years old and has a legitimate job. The county magistrate did not prohibit the rumors in Yangzhou in advance, nor did he investigate the truth afterwards. Instead, he released the robbers who robbed Zhu and allowed them to falsely accuse an innocent civilian. He used torture to extract a confession. The association was requested to seek justice for its member. All members of the association were indignant upon hearing this and held an emergency meeting. They all believed that the county magistrate should maintain local order and stability, and should not listen to rumors and torture innocent civilians. They decided to send member Ruan Mubai to Yangzhou for a secret investigation, and appointed Song Shiyi to draft a petition to the provincial government and the Control Yuan, requesting that the county magistrate be severely punished according to the law. The meeting adjourned, and the clock struck six.</p>

<p>Lotus Flowers in Full Bloom, Fragrance Carried by the Clear Breeze</p>
<p>Specially Prepared Distilled Water to Brew Red and Green Aromatic Tea</p>
<p>Since the Donggou Municipal Scenic Garden began opening day and night last week after renovating the garden and installing electric lights, the number of people going there to escape the heat has been endless every day at 2 PM. At 11:30 PM, when the ferry for the cool off trip returned to Shanghai, there were still people lingering and reluctant to leave, which shows how cool and elegant it is. This reporter went for a visit. Take the municipal ferry from the steel pier of the Bund in Nanjing Road to Donggou and disembark. Walk east along Donggou Road for about a hundred steps and you will see red and green electric lights shining brightly, which is the main gate of the garden. The words "Qingliang Garden" (Cool Garden) are attached to the gate. Entering the gate, the shadows of the trees are jagged and the green shadows are colorful, making you feel refreshed and invigorated. In the western part of the garden, there is a small stream, with winding streams. Willow trees are planted along the stream and a road is built along the stream leading to the earthen mountain. There is a pavilion on the mountain and a grassland on the side of the mountain, a green expanse. Sitting and walking is very pleasing to the eyes. In front of the grassland is a tea room, with various drinks available, and red and green famous teas are brewed with distilled water. Tourists often sit and chat, taste tea, and reminisce about the old days. In front of the room, the earth rises and falls under the mountain, surrounded by a lotus pond. A small bridge is built over the pond, with green waves and red railings, which is ancient and elegant. Moreover, the garden is full of clear breeze and the fragrance of lotus flowers, as if in a cool world, a truly winning place. After the tour, it was midnight. At 11 o'clock, I took the cool-off boat back. The sea is troubled and the heat is pressing. Why not go for a visit to breathe the cool air?</p>

<p>Shao's Operation of Flower Shows and Gambling Has Been Very Successful in Recent Years</p>
<p>Men in Dark Blue Silk Gowns Fired a Barrage of Shots</p>
<p>Shao Wenbin Dies Tragically at the Intersection of Rue Delorme</p>
<p>One Assailant Shot Dead by Two Detectives</p>
<p>Four Bystanders Wounded by Stray Bullets</p>
<p>At 8:45 last night, a shooting occurred on Rue Amiral Courbet in the French Concession. The victim was Shao Wenbin, a well-known figure in Shanghai. He was shot five times and died at the scene. There were five assailants. One of them fled to the gate of the residence of the late Shanghai merchant Huang Chu Jiu, 914 Avenue Edouard VII in the International Settlement (now changed to the Beijing Bookstore), and was shot and killed by Chinese Constable No. 632. Four people were wounded by stray bullets. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e160">Operating Flower Shows and Gambling <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Shao Wenbin (nickname A'liu), a local Shanghai native, was 50 years old. He was fond of traditional music, so he learned Shen Opera (commonly known as Shanghai Opera). He first entered the Xiaoshijie, then the Xinshijie, and then the Xinxin Garden when it opened. Before he could complete his term, he stopped performing. Shao then abandoned his old profession and sought other ways out. Recently, he has been diligently operating the illegal flower shows and gambling business. His daily income is still substantial. He also has an old-fashioned carriage car for transportation and lives at 2939 in the Concession.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Investigation of Family Situation <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Shao's elder brother, Wenrong, is 63 years old. He used to be in the shipping business and now lives at 19 Lane 4, Ronglan Fang, Route Cardinal Mercier in the French Concession. Shao and his concubine, Ms. Chen (33 years old), live with his elder brother. He also rented room 423 in the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road with his friend Huang Zhifu (nickname Monk) for entertainment. However, Shao always had lunch and dinner with his elder brother. Shao has a son named Ganlin, 18 years old, who is also living with his elder brother.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Someone Calls "Brother A'liu" <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after Shao had lunch at his brother's house, he took his car at about 3 PM to Xiaoyaochi Bathhouse at the corner of Ningbo Road in East Xinjiao Street to take a bath. After chatting with his friends, it was already 8:30 in the evening. He got dressed and took his car to the Far East Hotel. After Shao got out of the car, he ordered the driver, Chen Baoli, to drive the car back to get gas and then wait at the original place. The driver obeyed the order and drove the car away. Shao saw the car driving away and was about to turn around and enter the gate of the Far East when he suddenly heard someone shout "Brother A'liu" from behind.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Barrage of Shots Fired at Shao <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Shao turned around and looked carefully and saw two people wearing raw silk shirts and pants, whom he knew. He asked them what was the matter. The two briefly told him a few words. The three then took a rickshaw together and went south. They then turned into Route Amiral Courbet and stopped at the intersection of Rue Delorme. Shao had just gotten out of the rickshaw when three men in dark blue silk gowns suddenly came from across the street and rushed to Shao, pulled out their guns, and fired a barrage of shots at Shao. Another person went north along Hongyun Lane, crossed Avenue Edouard VII, and went to the gate of the residence of the late Shanghai merchant Huang Chu Jiu, opposite the Nanjing Grand Theater.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Assailant and Bystanders Injured <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>When Shao was attacked, there were many people cooling off by the roadside. When they saw the shooting, they blew the whistle. At the same time, Chinese Constables No. 1961 and No. 2249, who were on duty at the intersection of Avenue des Courses and Rue Dragon in the International Settlement, heard the alarm and drew their guns. They suspected it was a robbery. They saw a man rushing across the road with a gun in his hand and ordered him to stop, but he ignored them. So they fired at him. The two constables fired a total of sixteen shots. The assailant was hit by eight bullets and fell to the ground. At this time, stray bullets wounded four people: Fan Zhongyi, 37 years old, from Baoshan, a snack vendor, wounded in the left foot; Shen Chaozong, 19 years old, from Zhenjiang, wounded in the right foot; Chuan Wenhua, 25 years old, a local Shanghai native (employee of Changshou Pharmacy), wounded in the right leg; and an old woman, Dai Zhou, 69 years old, a local Shanghai native, wounded in the right foot.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Assailant Dies in Hospital <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The injured assailant and the four people wounded by stray bullets were sent to the Renji Hospital. The thief died in the hospital due to his injuries. The other four had minor injuries and were discharged from the hospital. One was seriously injured and remained in the hospital. As for the main victim, Shao Wenbin, he had died at the scene. The police notified the Tongren Auxiliary Yuan Hall to send a hall porter to carry the body to the morgue. There were a total of five gunshot wounds on his body: one on the left and right chest, one on the back, and one on the head. Shao's white silk gown was covered in blood. At the same time, the body of the dead thief was also carried from the hospital to the morgue. The police immediately sent fingerprint personnel with equipment to the morgue to take the fingerprints of the two bodies, pending the inspection by the First Special Court today.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Fengxiang and Huian Collided; Yesterday, Ship Surveyors Were Hired to Inspect <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Fengxiang Unloaded Cargo Yesterday; Huian Continued to Export as Usual</p>
<p>Responsibility Issue to be Negotiated Between the Two Parties</p>
<p>Taifeng Shipping Company's Fengxiang collided with Zhengji Shipping Company's Huian, which was leaving for Yantai and Andong, on the Yangjiadu waterfront the day before yesterday afternoon. Yesterday, ship surveyors were hired to inspect the damage and make a public judgment according to law. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e167">Hiring Ship Surveyors <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>After Zhengji Company's Huian was hit, the iron plates in the middle cabin were damaged. The export was stopped and the ship was sailed back to the Dong Province Railway Pier. They hired ship surveyor Engels to inspect the damage. At the same time, they sent a letter to Taifeng Company stating that the losses incurred by Huian should be fully borne by Fengxiang. They requested that personnel be sent immediately to inspect the damage to Huian.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Fengxiang Repairs <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>After Taifeng Company's Fengxiang was hit, a hole was broken in the bow and the iron plates and rivets were damaged. It was sailed to Hongsheng Pier in Pudong to unload the cargo. It also sent a reply to Zhengji Company, requesting that personnel be sent to inspect the damage to Fengxiang. It was decided that after the cargo was unloaded, it would be sailed to Gaochang Temple to anchor for repairs.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Inspection of Damage <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>At 4 PM the day before yesterday, Mr. Engels, a surveyor from the Zhengji Company, went to the Dong Province Railway pier to inspect the damage to the Huian vessel. However, due to the vessel being fully loaded with cargo, the inspection was difficult. He immediately ordered the cargo in the middle hold to be removed. He revisited the ship at 9 AM yesterday for a follow-up inspection. The results showed that the iron plates in the middle hold were damaged, but it was above the waterline and not a major problem. Zhengji Company decided that, given the cargo already loaded, they would make minor repairs to the damaged area and proceed with the export as planned, with more thorough repairs to be carried out after returning to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Preliminary Consultation <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Huian vessel set sail as scheduled last night for Yantai and Andong. The Fengxiang vessel will be repaired as soon as the cargo is unloaded. As for the issue of responsibility for the collision, the Taifeng Company and Zhengji Company began direct consultations yesterday to find a solution. As both sides have a good, amicable relationship, if a resolution cannot be reached, the matter will be submitted for legal judgment, or reported to the Navigation Administration Bureau to establish a collision dispute resolution committee.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Major Organizational Changes at the Shanghai Office of the Dalian Steamship Company <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Transportation Concentrated in the Northeast</p>
<p>Development of Manchurian and Mongolian Export Goods</p>
<p>Shanghai Reduced to Third-Class Branch</p>
<p>Shanghai is an important seaport for foreign trade in China. Export goods from all ports along the Yangtze River are concentrated in Shanghai and transshipped for export. Imported goods destined for the interior also mostly transit through Shanghai. Therefore, shipping companies from all countries regard Shanghai as the central hub of the Far East, and their general managers are all based in Shanghai. Even Japanese steamship companies, in addition to their head offices, consider Shanghai a first-class branch office. Ports such as Hong Kong and Dalian are under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai office. Since Japan forcibly occupied the four northeastern provinces of China and established the puppet state of Manchukuo, Japanese goods have been boycotted by China, and the organizational structure of Japanese shipping companies has also changed due to the shifting situation. Shanghai, which the Japanese have regarded as a base for developing shipping for decades, is now being moved to Dalian in one fell swoop, with Shanghai being reduced to a third-class district and undergoing downsizing. The changes in Japanese shipping companies in Shanghai are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e172">Easy Export of Grains Transferred <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Of the millions of tons of Northeastern soybeans and other grains shipped annually from Europe and the United States, 60-70% were traditionally transshipped through Shanghai. Even those directly shipped to Dalian for loading only paid customs duties once. Starting from September 25th of last year, the puppet state forcibly seized control of customs duties in the Northeast, resulting in a double tax on soybeans and other grains, which then disappeared from the trade routes to Shanghai. European and American buyers of these grains have had to change their shipping locations, no longer transshipping through Shanghai, and instead loading directly. Competition in the shipping industry has also arisen as a result.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Japanese Merchants Seize Shipping Rights <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Japanese occupation of the Northeast, Japanese shipping companies, under the direction of their government, aimed to develop Manchuria and Mongolia and expand exports. They rushed to seize priority in Northeastern shipping. Long-distance transportation was limited to Nippon Yusen, Osaka Shosen, and Mitsui Lines. Short-sea transportation was taken over by Dalian Kisen. Each steamship company competed to build new ships to travel from the Northeast to Europe and the United States, and the first-class branch office in Shanghai was moved to Dalian, while Shanghai was reorganized and reduced to a third-class branch. Nippon Yusen's six express ships were built for this new route. Nippon Yusen, Osaka Shosen, and other companies have added Dalian to their routes to Europe, America, and Australia to transport Northeastern export goods. Several Japanese ships have already cancelled their Shanghai voyages. Originally, Dalian and other locations were under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai branch, but now they are all managed by Dalian.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Shanghai Office Restructures <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese steamship branch offices in Shanghai have all been downgraded from first-class to third-class. According to their organizational regulations, the number of personnel used is also being reduced by half. The remaining employees in Shanghai are being transferred to Dalian. All Japanese steamship companies in this port are in the process of complying with these changes. Previously, only those who had served as the head of the Shanghai branch could be promoted to the president of the Japanese head office. Now, it is becoming necessary to have served as the head of the Dalian branch to be promoted to president of the head office, and Shanghai has been downgraded in importance.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Changes in Osaka Shosen Kaisha President <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Osaka Shosen Kaisha in this port has received instructions from the head office to reorganize. Watanabe Tokukichi, the president of the Shanghai branch, has been transferred to become the president of the Dalian branch. Inoue Akio, who was in the New York division, has been transferred to become the president of the Shanghai branch. With Shanghai reorganized as a third-class branch, the employees who are to be laid off will be taken by Watanabe to the Dalian branch. Watanabe has already handed over his duties yesterday, and Inoue has taken over. From now on, the management and development objectives of Japanese shipping in China will shift from Shanghai to the Northeast. This is a noteworthy record of the changes in Japanese shipping to China.</p>

<p>The lottery will be drawn at 1 PM. The steel lottery machines used for this lottery have been properly dispatched by the British-owned Ruirong Company, totaling three machines, A, B, and C, with machine B being the largest, and machines A and C being equal in size. When the lottery is drawn, in addition to sending letters of invitation to the Shanghai District Court, the First Special District Court, the Second Special District Court, and other government offices, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, and other official French representatives to supervise, the public will be allowed to enter the venue to observe at will, without selling tickets or imposing any restrictions. As for these 500,000 lottery tickets, if they cannot all be sold, the remaining number will be purchased by the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, these lottery tickets will always be considered sold out.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Explanation of Lottery Drawing <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The office is currently issuing an explanation of the lottery drawing in Chinese and English, stating that three steel lottery machines will be used. These three machines are all installed on iron bases, with a semi-circular steel frame around the machine, so they can rotate freely. Inside the machine, there are multiple wooden toggles and steel teeth. When the machine rotates, the wooden toggles move the small balls inside the machine, causing them to pass through the copper teeth and be evenly stirred. Each machine has a spring-loaded door at the top and bottom that opens when triggered, releasing the small ball into a glass container. 1. Machine A. Machine A has 667 small balls, one engraved with the character "Deng" (meaning First Prize), two engraved with "Er" (Second Prize), four engraved with "San" (Third Prize), ten engraved with "Si" (Fourth Prize), fifty engraved with "Wu" (Fifth Prize), one hundred engraved with "Liu" (Sixth Prize), and five hundred engraved with "Qi" (Seventh Prize). The number of small balls in machine A matches the number of winning tickets from First Prize to Seventh Prize, totaling 667. 2. Machine B. Machine B has 5,000 small balls, engraved with numbers from 0000 to 4999, representing the first four digits of the winning ticket number, totaling 5,000 numbers. 3. Machine C. Machine C has 100 small balls, engraved with numbers from 00 to 99, representing the last two digits of the winning ticket number, totaling 100 numbers. When the lottery is drawn, in addition to the supervisory committee dispatched by the National Government's Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Committee, representatives from the local court, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Bankers' Association will be invited to supervise. The hall will be opened half an hour before the drawing, welcoming people from all walks of life to inspect the machines and small balls. After the inspection is complete, the small balls will be placed in the machines. After the machines have been rotated multiple times to ensure the small balls are stirred evenly, the spring on the door will be released, allowing one small ball to flow out. The numbers drawn from machines B and C will be combined to form the winning ticket number. The number drawn from machine A will be the prize level. The numbers on the small balls drawn from machines B and C will be reported and recorded, and then re-entered into the machines. However, the numbers on the small balls drawn from machine A will not be re-entered, until all 660 small balls in machine A have been drawn, at which point the lottery will be completed. The Eighth Prize and Ninth Prize are those whose last one or two digits are the same as the First Prize number and are not drawn separately. Prizes will be awarded seven days after the drawing (August 7th). As for the lottery drawing method, here is an example: If the number drawn from machine B is 0034, and the number drawn from machine C is 29, and the number drawn from machine A is 3, then lottery ticket number 003429 wins the Third Prize, worth 50,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The second issue of the Aviation Highway Construction Lottery has now been printed, and sales will begin simultaneously in all locations on August 1st. The number of provinces selling the lottery will be greater than the first time, but remote areas with poor transportation will still be difficult to sell in.</p>

<p>After the case of Western and Chinese police officers from North Sichuan Road assaulting people across the border occurred, the First Special District Citizens' Joint Association and the 25th District Branch of this city not only sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association to forward to the Municipal Council to stop the behavior, but also petitioned the First Precinct of the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau to seriously negotiate with the relevant police station. Now, we have learned that the district branch has received a letter from the First Precinct of the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau, stating that, "In response to your letter stating that Hu Changyong, the owner of the Global Western Food Company, was assaulted by Western and Chinese police officers from the Public Concession without cause, and requesting our office to seriously negotiate with the relevant police station, nearly ten days have passed without a reply, so we are writing to inquire about the situation. We have seriously negotiated with the Hongkou Police Station, and we have received a satisfactory written reply from the police station. We are writing to inform you of the above and request your review."</p>

<p>Outer Sea Police Team Ordered to Pursue</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Townsmen Association received a letter from Xiangshan yesterday stating that Wu Atu, a fisherman from Guixiang Village in the eastern part of Xiangshan, owned a fishing boat. A few days ago, he and his crew Lin Gui, Li Ayuan, Ding Weixing, etc., were fishing with nets at sea when they were robbed by Wang Bosui's bandits. Wu Atu and the crew were all kidnapped, but were rescued by a patrol boat from the Fisheries Bureau. Before the patrol boat had traveled far, more than a hundred bandits, led by bandit leader Wang Bosui, arrived in more than ten civilian boats and surrounded the patrol boat. Patrol leader Yan Dingchen and the crew knew they were outnumbered and all fled. The bandits then kidnapped You Lin Gui, Li Bangshou, and Hu Cang, and burned the patrol boat. They then raided Shezui Village, loaded their loot, and headed towards Langji Mountain in Linhai. It is also reported that Ouyang Ge, the captain of the Second Detachment of the Outer Sea Police, sent a letter to the Linhai County Government yesterday, reporting the incident and ordering Commander Xu Shidan to quickly dispatch boats to pursue and rescue the kidnapped fishermen.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Flower Gambling Will Harass Landlords <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The Police in Charge Should Take Responsibility First</p>
<p>Wen Hongen, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, previously ordered a strict investigation and prosecution of flower gambling, which was rampant in the territory. However, offenders continued to commit offenses and secretly established listening posts and shipping companies to collect gambling money. Director Wen issued a notice stating that anyone found to be operating a flower gambling establishment would have the owner of the house arrested and prosecuted. He then submitted a request to the Municipal Government for approval. It is now heard that the Municipal Government has instructed the director to comply. According to the original order, which is roughly as follows, "Whether the landlord knew that the property was leased for use as a gambling venue and whether the landlord intended to profit from it are both factual and legal issues. The landlord cannot be arrested and prosecuted simply because a flower gambling establishment is discovered. Furthermore, it is customary in Shanghai that most property owners have rental agents to manage everything. If the rental agent has violated the trust of the property owner and leased the property for use as a gambling venue, then the fault lies with the rental agent, and the property owner should not be held responsible. The fault lies with the rental agent. In the future, if the bureau encounters such cases, it should investigate carefully, determine the facts, and dispose of the matter according to law, to avoid harming the innocent." It is heard that Director Wen has instructed his subordinates to comply with the order.</p>

During a preliminary hearing led by Chief Zhu, the man identified himself as Chen Fulin, 46 years old, from Xinghua, Fujian. The child with him was named Zhang Xiaoyin, purchased five years ago.

<h3 id="e197">French Concession Police Issue Orders to Strictly Arrest the Morphine King <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The morphine king, Zhang Zhongguo (formerly mistakenly reported as Zhong Han), a native of Ningbo, and his brother Zhang Zhonghai, initially opened the Zhongxing Inn next to the Catholic Church at the west end of Laobeimen on Min'guo Road in the French Concession. They accumulated capital by dealing in opium and, in four or five years, amassed assets of hundreds of thousands, becoming extremely wealthy. Their morphine manufacturing facilities were previously located in the International Settlement and in the countryside west of Shanghai. Due to their secrecy, they were never discovered by officials, allowing them to operate freely and profit. Recently, due to strict crackdowns in both the Chinese and International settlements, they could no longer operate there. They initially intended to shut down and cease operations to avoid scrutiny, but because they still had unfinished raw materials worth approximately thirty to forty thousand gold coins, the Zhangs thought the sum was too large to abandon. Therefore, on the first of this month, they moved from the International Settlement to No. 5, Xia Linli, Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession, planning to sell off the remaining inventory before closing down. They utilized the rooftop platform of the three-story building, constructing four small wooden rooms to house the machinery and motors for manufacturing. To avoid attracting attention, workers used thick hemp ropes to ascend and descend. All incoming and outgoing goods and accounts were managed by Zhongguo's daughter, A'cui, who supervised the work day and night, rushing to finish within a month before moving on to other ventures. Unexpectedly, on the seventh of this month, Chief Inspector Jin Jiulin of the French Concession's Special Bureau and Detective Wang Zhihao discovered their operation and raided the premises at 10 PM. The Zhang brothers were out and had not returned, but they captured eight workers: Yu Jinfu, Zhou Xuewen, Ye Ronggen, Fei Xianggen, Wang A'er, Wu Mingsheng (real name Yu Mingchun), Jiang A'si, and Chen Li'shi. They seized motors, machinery, twenty-two "chi" of finished morphine, and four lead buckets of unfinished raw materials. The items were sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution. After a trial presided over by Judge Wang Gangxu, the verdict is scheduled to be announced today. Previous reports have briefly covered these events. It is now understood that the "king" brothers and their daughter escaped the dragnet and remain at large. In order to eradicate drugs and eliminate evil, the police authorities have instructed all detectives to investigate within the concession for any secretly established facilities of this kind and immediately arrest and bring them to justice. Simultaneously, an arrest warrant has been issued, ordering all detectives to closely investigate and apprehend the escaped morphine king, the Zhang brothers, their daughter, and bring them to justice for interrogation.</p>

Every summer, bedbugs and fleas disturb bedding and suck human blood, causing unbearable itching. Now, the China Insecticide Company at No. 9 Hankou Road in this city has newly invented an Insecticide King liquid. Once sprayed, bedbugs and other insects die instantly and do not revive, an astonishing effect. The company, fearing disbelief, specially submitted it to the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Chemistry Inspection Institute for chemical verification, proving its great effectiveness, which cannot be compared with other medicines. It is said that, to relieve human suffering, it is now available for public sale. Samples are 5 cents per bottle, and a large bottle with a sprayer is only 1 yuan.

<p>To the Editor, In the news item about the preparatory meeting of the National Salvation Federation organized by the Overseas Chinese General Association at the Xin Xin Lou, your newspaper listed the Ningbo Fellow-Countrymen Association as one of the participating representatives. Please be advised that our association did not send anyone to participate yesterday. We hereby issue this statement and request a correction. Sincerely, The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Countrymen Association, July 28. To the Editor, Your newspaper published a news item on the 28th of this month entitled "Misfortune of Employees of Xin Ming Lun Teahouse," which contains many inaccuracies. First, Xu Jinzhi and Jiang Zhigao were temporarily ordered to leave the ship and remain in Shanghai pending investigation after mutual consultation between our union and the authorities. They were not forcibly driven ashore by armed personnel. Second, our union did not send a representative, Hou Dachun, to the ship that day, nor did we provide evidence of wrongdoing by Xu and Jiang. Whether Xu and Jiang have committed fraud is still under strict investigation. In order to prevent misunderstandings due to external misinformation, we hereby issue this correction and request that it be published in the corrections column tomorrow to dispel public doubts. Sincerely, Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, July 28.</p>

<p>An instruction from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education states: It has been decided that in order to actively guide local elementary schools to improve, the department previously stipulated that local education supervisors be established within the provincial middle schools' experimental elementary schools to guide improvement by district. Methods were established and promulgated. Last year, teacher training districts were established, and in accordance with Article 7 of the Outline of the Jiangsu Provincial Teacher Training Education Improvement Plan, each teacher training district should establish two to three local education supervisors. Although their specific duties are not explicitly defined, their goal is to guide local education. Now, some middle school experimental elementary schools have been converted into affiliated elementary schools following the teacher training schools, and the previously promulgated methods for guiding local education are no longer applicable. Based on the Outline of the Jiangsu Provincial Teacher Training Education Improvement Plan, eight articles of the Provisional Measures for the Establishment of Elementary Education Supervisors in Jiangsu Province Teacher Training Districts have been drafted and passed by the 587th meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee. In addition to separate orders, the measures are issued herewith.

<p>Existing Students Will Continue Until Graduation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education issued an instruction to the city's private secondary schools yesterday, stating that starting from the 22nd year of the Republic of China (i.e., starting from the autumn of 1933), all private secondary schools in the city that also run normal school departments must not enroll new freshmen or transfer students. Existing students will continue until graduation. This bureau has already ordered compliance with this rule. It has been found that some school enrollment advertisements still advertise for new freshmen and transfer students for the normal school departments, which is very inappropriate. To avoid long-term negligence, this bureau reiterates the previous order. In the future, if there are any violations of the law, this bureau will definitely ban it. This order must be obeyed.</p>

<p>The special training institute organized by the Shanghai Secondary School Teachers' Association has been very successful since its opening.

<h3 id="e223">The Disaster Relief Association for Secondary Schools in This City Subsidizes Daogang and Anhui Schools with Relief Funds <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The Disaster Relief Association for Secondary Schools in the Shanghai "January 28th" War Zone consists of 13 schools, including Aiguo Girls' High School, Jianguo Middle School, Fudan Experimental Middle School, Lida Academy, Nanyang Commercial High School, Guangdong Middle School, Shanghai North Middle School, Minsheng Middle School, Xinmin Middle School, Chizhi Affiliated Middle School, China Women's Physical Education Normal School, Daogang Girls' Middle School, and Anhui Middle School. All of them suffered heavy disasters, and have repeatedly applied to the Municipal Bureau of Education and the War Zone Relief Committee for remedies, and have received several batches of relief funds. However, only Daogang and Anhui schools have not received this relief fund because they have not been registered. Although the association has repeatedly requested the authorities, it has not been approved. The association believes that since the two schools are both members of the association and have suffered roughly the same disasters, how can they be left out? Therefore, there is a resolution to subsidize them. It is heard that the method is to take the school with the lowest amount of relief funds as the standard, and then distribute it equally according to the amount received by each school to subsidize them. The two schools can each receive 360 yuan. In addition, because the amount received by the school that has already received it cannot be less than the amount received by the school that is subsidized, the school with the least amount received will no longer be required to contribute funds for subsidies to show fairness. It is also heard that the method has been properly allocated by the association's standing committee, and fees will be collected from each school that should contribute. Once the fees are collected, they will be handed over to Daogang and Anhui schools to clear the procedures and end the matter.</p>

<p>Over Seventy Swimmers, Including a 10-Year-Old Girl and a 13-Year-Old Boy</p>
<p>丨Chen Mingshu, Weng Zhaoyuan, and Li Jishen All Attend to Observe丨</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) The Seven Sisters Chinese Swimming Club, with the support of Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and Li Zongren, and the offering of prizes, held a swimming competition. To promote long-distance swimming, the club specially organized a cross-harbour swim on the 23rd, divided into five categories: men's and women's open, men's and women's members, and advanced members. Those who ranked high received grand silver awards. The club members were especially favored, and those who reached the finish line, regardless of order, received additional commemorative prizes. A total of 98 members and friends from various associations signed up, making it a grand occasion. The number of men and women who came to watch that day was even more lively, with crowds coming and going, and the Chinese swimming pool was almost impossibly crowded. Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen, accompanied by Weng Zhaoyuan and others, arrived on an electric boat to watch. At 2:30 PM, all the participating men and women had gathered and set off by boat to Hung Hom. The women started four minutes before the men at the Huangpu Shipyard. The tide was out that day, so the finish line was set at the outermost boundary of the water polo field. The club also hired several electric boats and sampans and prepared sufficient rescue equipment to ensure safety. Once the men and women entered the water, the sea was filled with bobbing heads. Yang Xiuqiong led the women, followed by the Western woman, Smith. Lin Duli, a young girl from Chung Sing School, also followed closely. Among the men, Kimpelo from the YMCA, and Guo Zhenheng and Wang Xinmin from South China, and Shi Jinpei from Good Friends were the fastest. The competition among them was also the fiercest. By the halfway point, Kimpelo had taken the lead, followed by Guo Zhenheng, with Yang Xiuqiong in third place. The order remained the same until the finish line. In total, 79 swimmers entered the water, and 74 reached the finish line, a very good result. Lin Duli from Chung Sing and Mai Weiming from the Chinese staff were particularly praised by the audience. Lin Duli was only 10 years old, and Mai Weiming was only 13. These young children accomplished amazing feats, which naturally earned them the audience's praise. Chen Mingshu's son, Chen Guangcheng, also participated that day and reached the finish line. The results of the top two or three in each group, and the order in which each participant reached the finish line, are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e250">Liu Xuesong Advocates That Tsinghua Should Send Students to the US to Study Physical Education <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>Liu Xuesong expressed his thoughts on Tsinghua's recent recruitment of students for studying in the US. He said that he read in the newspaper that Tsinghua's regulations for recruiting students to study in the US are limited to literature, science, engineering, and agriculture, and there is no special quota for physical education. Xuesong, having just returned from the US, deeply feels that the reason why people in that country are energetic and diligent in their work is largely due to their strong physical constitution. To achieve a strong physical constitution, one cannot succeed without physical education. Last year, the National Sports Conference was held in Beijing, and the petition to the Ministry of Education to send students to study physical education in the US was approved. Now that Tsinghua is recruiting students, it is a good opportunity to seek advanced studies for domestic physical education talents, but the Ministry of Education has not paid attention to this, which is a pity. When I was studying at Springfield, the Japanese government sent a government-funded student, but in our country, there was no such thing. After returning to China, Springfield University specially set up a free scholarship for our country, with an honorary award, and has contacted me to introduce students. Other countries' schools are even more encouraging to us, but the domestic authorities turn a blind eye, which is puzzling. The strength of an individual's physique and the rise and fall of a nation are all dependent on the prosperity of physical education. The weakness of the Chinese people's physique and the decline of the nation are already so obvious. If we still do not emphasize physical education, I fear that in a few decades, there will be no place for us in the international community. I believe that the sports community should strive for this based on reason to promote the authorities' advocacy.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Athletic Achievements of Zhijiang College of Arts and Sciences <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Since the resumption of Zhijiang College of Arts and Sciences four years ago, there have been many noteworthy developments in physical education. Here is a summary of the main points. In the autumn of 1929, when the school resumed, there were more than 300 students in four grades in the high school and college departments. The funding for physical education was sufficient to maintain operations. In the winter of that year, the school joined the Hangzhou A-League football competition and won the championship. The following spring, the school held its first all-school sports meet, with excellent results and high spirits. The school won the overall championship in the first Zhejiang Provincial Games and track and field events, which was quite a sensation at the time. In the same year, when the province selected representatives for the National Games, the players of various sports teams were mainly from our school, which quickly gained a reputation and spread to Beijing and Shanghai. In the autumn of 1930, in the four-university volleyball competition, the school defeated the powerful Shanghai University team in Suzhou. In the winter of the same year, the school won two Hangzhou football championships and was runner-up in the four-university football competition. In the spring of 1931, the four-university basketball competition was held at our school, with the school, Shanghai University, and Jinling University sharing the championship, forming a three-way balance. In the autumn, our province held the second Zhejiang Provincial Games, and our school won the championship again. There were many talented people, which was a great success at the time. In the winter of the same year, the Northeast Incident occurred, and students engaged in military training, so they did not have time to focus on sports activities. At the same time, the focus of physical education gradually shifted from athlete training to general physical education, in order to seek balanced development. This year, the equipment was greatly expanded, with the addition of clubs, dumbbells, pommel horses, parallel bars, and training for freehand exercises, apparatus exercises, and swimming exercises during classes, so that all students could get proper physical training. It should be known that the progress of a school's physical education is not only measured by a few athletes, but by the healthy physique of all students. Therefore, the purpose of physical education training is not only to train athletes to win championships, but to enable everyone to have a strong physique and a healthy body and mind, in order to promote the true spirit of physical education. Looking back on the past four years, the physical education work of our college has made great progress, and its reputation has spread far and wide. The facilities have also been gradually enriched, including more than a dozen football fields, track and field fields, basketball, tennis, and volleyball courts, as well as a gymnasium and a swimming pool. The sports equipment has also been increased and enriched. Liu Xuesong is currently in charge of physical education, and in the future, he will focus on developing universal physical education, cultivating the healthy physique of young people, and promoting the strength of the nation.</p>

<p>—Yi Zhi</p>
<p>Before winding coils or making cages, the first step is to determine which gauge wire to use, the number of turns per hour, the length per pound, and the safe current load. If you have a wire table on hand, you can find the information immediately. However, if you do not have a wire table on hand, finding a wire table or asking someone is troublesome. Now, there is a simple method for calculating wire that is easy to understand and easy to remember. By following this method, the calculated results will be only slightly different from the values in the wire table. I will now describe this method in detail below.</p>
<p>The wire gauges used in the world are all based on the American Standard Wire Gauge (AWG) table, with the English abbreviation B&amp;S. The table lists the wire gauge, diameter, cross-sectional area, number of turns per hour, length per pound, and safe current load for checking and application. Now, by using this simple calculation method, you can calculate all the items listed on the table. I will explain them separately below.</p>
<p>(1) Finding the Wire Gauge</p>
<p>The wire gauge table has numbers from 1 to 45. Above number 1, there are also number 4, with distinctions made by using one zero, two zeros, etc. In this wire gauge table, the cross-sectional area of each wire gauge has a constant incremental number. For every three gauge numbers larger, the cross-sectional area increases by two times. For every three gauge numbers smaller, the cross-sectional area decreases by half. For every ten gauge numbers larger, the cross-sectional area increases by ten times. For every ten gauge numbers smaller, the cross-sectional area decreases by one-tenth. For example, the cross-sectional area of a 20-gauge wire in the table is 1022 circular mils (Circular Mils; one mil equals one-thousandth of an inch). Therefore, the cross-sectional area of a 17-gauge wire is 1022 x 2 = 2044 circular mils, and the cross-sectional area of a 23-gauge wire is 1022 x 0.5 = 511 circular mils. Therefore, knowing the cross-sectional area allows you to know the gauge number. Example: A wire has a cross-sectional area of 50 circular mils. What is the gauge number of this wire?</p>
<p>Solution: Since we know that the cross-sectional area of a 30-gauge wire is 100 circular mils, 50 ÷ 100 = 0.5 determines that it is a 33-gauge wire.</p>
<p>(2) Finding the Diameter</p>
<p>Take the square root of the cross-sectional area. The square root is the value of the diameter because the cross-sectional area is the product of the diameter multiplied by itself.</p>
<p>Example: A certain gauge wire has a cross-sectional area of 1022 circular mils. What is the diameter of this wire?</p>
<p>Solution: √1022 = 32 mils (to be continued)</p>

<p>—Shi Qiwei</p>
<p>In radio receivers, coils and capacitors are densely distributed and interconnected. It is difficult to avoid mutual magnetic and electrical inductance, which reduces the efficiency of each circuit and can even cause them to malfunction. Therefore, radio designers and manufacturers strive to avoid this magnetic inductance. The most effective way to do this is to use an isolation shield. Without discussing other parts, I will only study the isolation shield used for the coil. The shield must be made of a good conductive sheet, preferably aluminum or copper. The form, distance, and dimensions of the shield and the coil should be as follows: A is the shield, E is the metal base plate, D is the L-shaped metal, and C is the coil and shield.</p>
<p>The distance between</p>
<p>the coil and shield</p>
<p>should be more than</p>
<p>one inch.</p>
<p>The distance between B should be more than one-half of the diameter of the coil.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Measuring Resistance <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>—Qi</p>
<p>Most readers probably remember the article "Homemade High Resistance" in this publication. However, to determine its resistance accurately, you must use an instrument. If the resistance is very high, the current passing through it will also be very small. Using the ordinary method (as shown in the first diagram) will not be accurate, and the resistance that you want to measure will be limited. Exceeding the range will prevent you from measuring the accurate resistance.</p>
<p>However, by following the method described below, you can measure resistances from as small as a few ohms to as large as hundreds of thousands of ohms. The first diagram shows the ordinary method. AB are the connecting terminals, E is the battery, and the voltage does not have to be 1.5 volts; it can be higher. There is also a 0.1MA ammeter or a 0.10MA ammeter, but the former is more accurate. R is the resistance to be measured. According to Ohm's Law, R = E/I, so R must be at least Rx = 1.5/0.001 = or higher; otherwise, the current passing through it will exceed the range of the ammeter, and therefore you will not be able to determine its resistance. If you add a variable resistor to the above circuit (second diagram), short-circuit the AB terminals, and adjust the variable resistor R until the meter shows the maximum current, then separate the AB terminals. In this way, you can measure resistances of 100 ohms or higher. That is, R× = E/I - R. If the resistance to be measured is extremely high, you can increase the voltage of the battery E, but the resistance of R must also be changed. For example, if E is 1.5 volts, then R must be approximately R = E/.001-1.5</p>
<p>00.</p>
<p>The third diagram is for measuring resistances below 100 ohms. The function of R is the same as above, but this time, the AB terminals are not short-circuited, and the meter is made to show the maximum current. At this time, connect R, and you can use the following formula to calculate its resistance.</p>
<p>Rx = R/m - n - i</p>
<p>Rm is the resistance of the meter. For example, the meter mentioned above is approximately 30 ohms.</p>
<p>n is the ratio of the maximum current on the meter to the current indicated on the meter.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Rm = 30</p>
<p>Current indicated on the meter = 0.75MA</p>
<p>Then R × = (approximately)</p>

<p>—Zhenzhi</p>
<p>In AC radios, sometimes reversing the power plug can improve the reception, which is very strange. Although the positive and negative ends of the AC circuit alternate in time, the plug has a fixed way to insert it. Often, inserting it this way is correct, and inserting it that way is incorrect. Current flowing into your radio from one direction may perform better than current flowing in from the other direction. By repeatedly reversing the plug, you can test for a better current direction.</p>
<p>Try plugging your power plug in and out several times; you will be able to find a better way to insert it. Once you have found it, make corresponding marks on the plug and the socket, such as a small groove. Then, apply some white powder to the groove so that it is easy to identify when changing the position of the plug.</p>

<p>When making transformers, a winding machine is indispensable. It is not only faster than winding by hand but also more even. However, it seems too uneconomical to spend money to buy a winding machine just to wind one or two coils. A grinding wheel frame is an excellent substitute for a winding machine. You can borrow one from a metalworker, loosen the cap nut, remove the grinding wheel, and then install a wooden shaft made of a suitable iron core. Tighten the cap nut, and you can apply it. (Note: The handle of the grinding wheel frame and the rotation direction of the grinding wheel are often opposite; therefore, you must crank it in reverse to wind the coil. The iron sheet next to the grinding wheel should also be removed to avoid scratching the enameled wire.)</p>
<h3 id="e259">Method for Identifying Fixed Resistors <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>—Chen Qibei</p>
<p>Recently, the resistance of various fixed resistors produced by electrical component factories is not indicated by numbers but is distinguished by colors. I will now list the color counting table published in the United States for purchasers to identify.</p>
<p>The color painted on the entire body is the first number.</p>
<p>One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Zero</p>
<p>The color on the tail end is the second number.</p>
<p>Brown Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Violet Gray White Black</p>
<p>One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Zero</p>
<p>The color in the middle waist is the third number.</p>
<p>Black Brown Red Orange Yellow Green Blue</p>
<p>○○○○○○○</p>
<p>·······</p>
<p>○○○○○○</p>
<p>○○○○○</p>
<p>○○○○</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>○○</p>
<p>○</p>
<p>For example, if the color of the body is brown, the color of the tail is green, and the color of the waist is red, then the resistance is 1,500 ohms. The rest can be found in the same way.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Precautions for Using and Charging Storage Batteries <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>—Zhong Shixing</p>
<p>Storage batteries can be divided into lead-acid batteries and nickel-iron batteries. Lead-acid batteries have a higher voltage than nickel-iron batteries, so the use of copper storage batteries is more common. Both are very expensive, and if we protect and use them properly, they can last for many years without breaking.</p>
<p>Storage batteries have a higher voltage when the current is sufficient. After using them for some time, the voltage gradually drops. When the current in a new copper storage battery is sufficient, the voltage is approximately two volts. After using it for some time, it is best not to use it again when the voltage drops to 1.8 volts. When a nickel-iron battery is fully charged, it is 1.4 volts. When it reaches 1 volt, it should no longer be used and must be recharged.</p>
<p>The voltage used in our radios is high, so multiple batteries are connected in series. On storage batteries, the red or ㈩ experience is the mark of the anode, and the black or ㈠ is the mark of the cathode. If we want a higher voltage, we will connect each anode individually. The height of the voltage is proportional to the amount of storage batteries.</p>
<p>The unit of storage battery capacity is called ampere-hours, which is the product of amperes and time. Most of the ones used in radios are 60 ampere-hours.</p>
<p>When we use it to the voltage specified above, we must recharge it. However, regardless of whether you use it or not, it is best to charge it once within a certain period. If it is not used for more than five or six months, you should pour out the liquid inside, wash it very clean with clean water, store the liquid, and put it back in when you need to use it. This way, it can be permanently preserved without breaking.</p>
<p>Charging a new storage battery for the first time is very troublesome, and it takes a relatively long time. It is best to reverse the positive and negative poles. After charging it a few times, you must fix it and not change it again. If we entrust a professional charger to recharge it a few times, it will be easier for us to do it ourselves later.</p>
<p>When charging, if the electrolyte is found to have white boiling foam, it means that it will reach a sufficient state. If the temperature is above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, it is not advisable to charge it again. Wait until it cools down before charging again. Use a liquid specific gravity meter or a voltmeter to measure. The charging voltage for a copper storage battery should be stopped at 1.300, and the voltage should be stopped at 2.6 volts to 2.8 volts. The charging voltage for a nickel-iron battery should be stopped at 1.200, and the voltage should be stopped at 1.5 volts.</p>
<p>At ordinary times, the surface of the storage battery should be wiped clean, and it should not be placed in a damp place. It is best to apply some Vaseline on the lid and put it in another box so that dirt will not accumulate, moisture will not penetrate, and the current will not disappear, and the medicine liquid will not evaporate and stain clothes, etc. The liquid medicine in the storage battery should be immersed on top of the copper plate. If it is dry, you can add distilled water. Do not arbitrarily add liquid medicine or unclean water. If you can use it according to the method, you will definitely be able to receive good results.</p>

<p>(11) General Structure of Radios</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the development of broadcast radio, the types of radios are too numerous to count. However, observing their general structure, they are nothing more than the following types:</p>
<p>(1) Antenna Circuit: The radio waves emitted by broadcast radio stations travel in all directions at a speed of approximately 300,000 kilometers per second. At this speed, they can circle the entire Earth more than seven and a half times. If a receiving antenna is installed in the path of the radio waves, the radio waves will be absorbed by the antenna and converted into an oscillating current with a frequency of more than 1.5 million cycles per second, flowing back and forth between the sky and the ground circuit. This type of current has an extremely high frequency and is commonly referred to as high-frequency current or radio-frequency current.</p>
<p>(2) Tuning Circuit: The tuning circuit is the gateway of the radio, consisting of a self-inductance coil and a capacitor. By changing the self-inductance in the coil and the capacitance of the capacitor, the natural frequency of the circuit is increased or decreased to match the radio-frequency symbol frequency that is to be received from the outside. In other words, the tuning circuit is used to select external radio waves. The quality of its manufacturing is sufficient to affect the selectivity and sensitivity of the radio.</p>
<p>(3) Radio-Frequency Amplification Circuit: The radio waves emitted by broadcast radio stations are often too weak due to distance or other reasons, and cannot be used without amplification. The radio-frequency amplification circuit is located between the tuning circuit and the detection circuit and is used to amplify the radio-frequency current.</p>
<p>(4) Detection Circuit: The detection circuit has a detector that acts as a rectifier, converting the radio-frequency current into an audio-frequency current with a lower frequency.</p>
<p>(5) Audio-Frequency Amplification Circuit: This circuit is located after the detection circuit and is used to amplify the audio-frequency current. (6) Output Circuit: In the output circuit, the audio-frequency current is converted into sound, and sound amplifiers and output coupling devices all belong to this circuit.</p>
<p>(7) Power Supply Circuit: The power supply circuit provides power to the radio. For DC radios, the required power source is dry batteries or storage batteries. For AC radios, the power source is the AC power from the lighting wires.</p>
<p>Correction: In the last line of the previous issue's "Common Knowledge," there were "four small squares in the map," which were not printed clearly. A special correction is provided below: "The symbol for grounding is 丨 or 丨, and the symbol for a ground grid is 丨 or 丨."</p>

<p>— Yao Baoyong</p>
<p>This type of B eliminator can be used with either AC or DC power, and with either 220 volts or 110 volts. If connected to 220 volts, simply connect a sixteen-candlepower ordinary light bulb in series at point X in the diagram.</p>
<p>The vacuum tube used by the author is a 2-volt powerful type, but any type can be used, as long as it is equipped with the appropriate filament voltage. The choke coil uses 30 Henrys, 25 MA.</p>
<p>When connecting to the AC power source for the first time, the ground wire can be removed, and then the plug can be inserted. If there is no sound, the plug can be turned around and inserted. Then, use a knife to make a mark on the plug and the socket to avoid incorrect connection in the future. This type of B eliminator is better than the type that uses a square shelf, because its power is taken directly from the lighting wire, without going through the square shelf, so there is no hissing sound.

<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>(3) Yang Huang, the Second Lü Hou</p>
<p>Chen Zhiyun, the leader of the detective team, specially dispatched capable detectives to rent a small house opposite the Yang mansion to investigate secretly. After a month, the rumors varied. Some said "Chen escaped," while others said "Chen was murdered," all of which were baseless speculations. After a month, the Yang family secretly moved away, knowing that if they stayed in this house for a long time, they would eventually be discovered. After the Yang family moved, the detectives rented houses around the Yang family's new residence. Gradually, they learned that the Yang family's maids and servants had been serving for a long time, and they must have known about the tragic case. The clues had to be extracted from their mouths, but they could not be arrested to avoid alarming the snake and causing the criminals to escape.</p>
<p>A car was parked next to the market, and the Yang mansion's maid was going to the market to buy food. Someone pulled her into the car and drove to the Public Security Bureau, where Mrs. Yang was detained. The car then returned to its original location. The Yang mansion waited for a long time for the maid to return, and then sent a servant girl to the market to look for her. She was also tricked into the car by the detective team and taken to the bureau for detention. Team leader Chen Zhiyun questioned them repeatedly, but the maids and servants insisted that they did not know. Chen Zhiyun gave each of them 300 yuan and said, "After you reveal the truth of the case, you can take this money home to support your family. You don't have to work for the Yang mansion anymore. Just tell the truth, what are you afraid of?" The effect of these 300 yuan was great. They honestly and without reservation confessed the tragic case of the jealous wife killing the concubine and destroying the body at the Public Security Bureau:</p>
<p>It turned out that after Chen was tricked into the tiger's den by Huang, they initially argued a few times. Huang then used both hands to tightly strangle Chen's throat, causing her to die of suffocation. Chen struggled desperately and bit Huang's thumb and index finger. With the help of "Uncle Moving Soldier," Huang was freed. She then used a large knife to frantically chop at Chen. After Chen died, her body was cut into dozens of pieces, boiled in a pot until rotten, and then secretly taken out of the house one by one and discarded in the wilderness to feed the dogs. As the saying goes, "The most poisonous heart is the heart of a woman," which refers to women like Huang. In the past, Lü Hou cut off the hands and feet of Consort Qi, making her the most cruel person. Huang's cruel methods can be called the second Lü Hou.</p>
<p>Now, the truth of the case has been revealed, the criminals have been arrested, bloodstains have been found on the walls, and there are still two tooth marks on Huang's hand, making it impossible to deny. Writing this, I want to show this case to the red figures in the political circles who like to take concubines, and also to the female students who are obsessed with vanity and like to become officials. After reading it, what are your thoughts?</p>

<p>After women enter puberty, their breasts gradually rise due to physiological reasons, which is a natural beauty. But for some reason, they want to eliminate it, using tight little vests to bind their breasts as flat as iron plates. Little do they know that this bad habit is no different from a suicidal policy. It prevents free breathing, which can lead to tuberculosis. The breasts are subjected to too much pressure, which can lead to breast tuberculosis. All of these are the gifts of corsets.</p>
<p>Moreover, this bad habit also has a great impact on the health of the nation, because the breasts are subjected to great pressure, the nipples become small or inverted, and the mammary glands cannot develop to their full potential. In the future, when they have children, they will not have good milk, and the children will not have good breast milk. Naturally, their bodies will not be healthy.</p>
<p>The harm of corsets to the country and individuals is so obvious, why don't women make fundamental changes?</p>

<p>High heels are no longer fashionable in Europe and America. In fact, they are also harmful to the body. In terms of physiology, the nerves are easily stimulated, the mind is easily fatigued, and the feet are easily deformed, resulting in thick skin or calluses. Sometimes, the position of the uterus can be tilted forward or backward, causing menstrual difficulties or menstrual pain. Moreover, it is easy to get injured when falling. Even walking is probably not as comfortable as Chinese flat shoes.</p>

<h3 id="e266">The Frozen Songhua River <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Miaoshen</p>
<p>When the scorching sun is high in the sky and sweat is pouring down like rain, let me talk about the frozen Songhua River, which may be like a cup of ice cream for the readers?</p>
<p>A few years ago, I was in Harbin, next to the Songhua River. At that time, although Harbin belonged to outside the customs, it still flew the Chinese flag. Now, times have changed, and it has become a foreign land. Things are really different now.</p>
<p>The climate in Harbin is very cold. Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, people are about to wear leather clothes. Harbin's water and land transportation is a very large trading port in the three northeastern provinces. When the Songhua River freezes in the cold weather, although ships cannot pass, many ice carts are added to the solid ice. These carts, also known as large carts in the north, can carry more than a thousand catties and are pulled by one or two horses. The carts travel on the ice. Because the ice is slippery, the speed is faster than on land. These carts often travel upstream from Harbin or are pulled from other places, and can travel one or two hundred miles a day. Because of the severe cold on the river, the drivers wear extremely thick old sheepskin coats, leather hats, and leather gloves. The fur of these leather hats and leather gloves is very long and looks quite rough, but it is very warm. There is also a kind of "ice raft" on the ice for people to sit on, also called a "lever." This thing is very simple in construction, with a board placed on two knife-like pieces of iron. The friction between the iron pieces and the ice is very small. People sit on the board, and one person uses a bamboo pole to touch the ice under the crotch. The "ice raft" then moves forward like a flying arrow. However, because the movement is too fast, it is difficult to control, so dangerous things often happen.</p>
<p>After the south bank freezes, there are naturally several air holes in the ice. These air holes are for the fish at the bottom of the ice to breathe. This also shows the intention of God in creating things. Fishermen take advantage of this and put their nets in the holes to fish. Big fish and small fish all come together, which is more labor-saving than when the river is not frozen. This is also something that people generally do not expect.</p>
<p>The ice on the river is several feet thick, and the back of the ice is full of sharp icicles. If someone accidentally falls into the air hole, there is no hope of survival. Therefore, walking on the ice, the air holes are more terrifying than traps. The ice is slippery and difficult to walk on, and being near the air holes is indeed very dangerous.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Water <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>All things expand when heated and contract when cooled. China's land, because there are too many friends who are only enthusiastic for five minutes, drink Dutch water and ice without restraint. Throughout this summer, they pour it into their stomachs all day long, cooling their blood! They only care about the shrinking of the land.</p>
<p>Because women are made of water, there are indeed too many fashionable women in the big cities of China. The water content is increasing year by year, becoming more widespread, creating a new record unseen in a century.</p>
<p>This year's floods in various places, at the most tense moments, people near the danger zones repeatedly recalled the dream of the flood of twenty years ago in their minds. As a result, disasters occurred, embankments collapsed, and water, compared with land in our country, is expanding on one hand and contracting on the other, creating a contradictory and incredible inverse proportion.</p>
<p>When water causes drought in some places, it turns the land red for thousands of miles, without a drop of sweet spring. When water causes floods in some places, boats travel on land, and huge waves roar. This kind of deformed development, the dangers, hunger, and pain suffered by the people, are like the water level markers, increasing day by day.</p>
<p>In the eyes of old-fashioned old women, water is only used for washing clothes, boiling tea, and cooking rice. Other than that, it has no emotional impact. Farmers, however, value water very much. If there is no water in the rice fields, they use waterwheels to irrigate them. When the rain falls and fills the banks, and the green seedlings are about to be submerged, they hope that the rain will subside. The rise and fall of the water level are closely related to the interests of the farmers. Women are made of water, and there are indeed too many fashionable women in the big cities. The production of water has become widespread and increased in recent years, creating a new record unseen in hundreds of years. According to this view, the taste of water is indeed sour, bitter, and shaking people's souls to the point of immobility. The scouring, impact, and huge waves that destroy houses are a situation that we humans are enduring. It is really unbearable!</p>

When our commander-in-chief comes to inspect our troops, it would be a great honor if we could get first place. In the future, the commander-in-chief will reward us..." Zhao Ziqiang spoke with all his energy, intending to get rid of the chill on his body at this time. However, he saw a soldier in the team whose face had changed color, holding a gun, and was swaying from side to side. He shouted: "Sheng Shimin, what's wrong with you?" Sheng Shimin dared not answer and immediately straightened his chest and held the gun straight. However, this method of forcibly supporting himself could not last. In less than a few minutes, his body swayed again. Zhao Ziqiang saw his appearance and knew that he was sick. He was about to ask him what was wrong and tell him to go down first, but the soldier could not wait any longer. The gun and the man fell forward and rolled to the ground. Zhao Ziqiang, seeing this, could not blame him any further. He told two soldiers to take him back to the company headquarters first. The two soldiers took him to the dormitory and asked, "What's wrong with you?" Sheng Shimin hummed, "My crotch is itchy and painful, it's killing me."</p>
<p>One soldier said: "Ha! This is scrotal eczema, a disease unique to us soldiers. Damn it, the people at the clothing factory cut corners and only care about making money for themselves, giving us soldiers these factory-packaged cotton-padded jackets to wear." As he said, he touched his crotch and said: "Look, the cold wind has gotten in, that's scrotal eczema. This disease is not easy to cure. You should discuss it with the company commander and find a way to ask the battalion commander for sick leave. You must not go to the military medical office to get treatment. I know that if you have an internal disease, they will give you some bitter sulfur to eat. If you have a surgical disease, they will apply some Vaseline. There are good medicines, but they won't give them to soldiers to treat their illnesses. They can still take them to sell for money. Anyway, if they sell them at a discount to those in the business, they are not afraid that no one will want them. If the illness is not cured, it's your fault if you die. Someone will report it for burial expenses, and they can still get some benefit." (142)</p>

<p>| Accelerated Rebound to 22.5 Yuan |</p>
<p>Since the previous morning's decline in the gold market, although there was growth in the London and New York silver markets, the exchange rates between the UK and US and US and UK fell considerably. The forward silver price on the Gold and Silver Exchange only rose by 2%, making it difficult to expect much. The raw plate opened at 27-28 yuan, US wheat rose 7.5 points, Canadian wheat rose 26 pounds, and stocks also rose more than they fell. Yuan Mao, Yong Rui, and Xing goods were all sold, falling back to 22-23 yuan. However, Bing Xing and Shunli were extremely well maintained and remained firm. Although there was some hovering after the opening, the underlying trend was still good. The exchange market was tight, and the price soon broke through 30 yuan in the afternoon. The afternoon closing rose, and the gold market saw even greater gains as the exchange market tightened further. The Dalian gang failed to get US dollars and eagerly purchased standard gold, making the situation extremely stable. The initial decline in Bombay was only 1 anna, and then it did not move again, but struggled slightly. It can be seen that the market was tight from the opening to the close, driven by the sudden tightening of exchange rates and the extraordinary tightness of the exchange market. In addition, Reuters reported in the morning that the US Treasury Department had approved the export of gold ingots and crude gold, and Reuters corrected its previous report that the five-nation silver supplement agreement was not entirely accurate, which boosted confidence. The quick price was increased by 200 yuan. The day's market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 827 yuan, a rebound of 15 yuan compared to the previous closing. Goods opened at 7 yuan 2 jiao. The exchange market opened with British hard currency and US tight currency. The near-term selling price for British exchange was 1 shilling 3 pence 375, and for US exchange it was 29 yuan 0625. Richang advanced gradually from 6 yuan. Hengxing, Fuyu, Hengyu, Zhaofeng, Chang, etc. also advanced. US dollars for October were so tight at 375 that it was difficult to settle, so Xinfeng Foreign Firm seized them. It rose to 9 yuan 8 jiao. Shunli, Hengyu, Qianchang, Xiangyifeng, Yong sold within 6 yuan. Pangen Huabi took 4375 US dollars for October and stabilized slightly. HSBC quoted the British price up 125 and the US price down 25. At this time, it hovered around 6 yuan. When Huabi came out with half a yuan for October, Hengyu, Dachen, Dafa, and Yongshunli sold together at 4 yuan. Pangen sought to settle half a yuan for October and 6875 for November, and the price rose to above 7 yuan. At this time, the struggle lasted for a long time, and the price was generally around 6 yuan. When Maijiali seized 625 US dollars for November and 675 for hedging, Shunli, Shunmao, Zhengchang, Yifeng, Yong Xiexing, and Yong all advanced. An seized 25 US dollars for September and the price rose to 9 yuan. It was difficult to settle 375 US dollars for October. Heng Fa and Yong Li purchased, and the price rose to 31.5 yuan. Goods came to sell. Mitsui offered 375 US dollars for October, Zhengjin plugged in 175 for September, and Zhengchang, Yuanfeng, Yonghengxing, and Bingxing all sold, gradually falling to 27.3 yuan. After entering, Huabi suddenly seized half a yuan for November. The exchange market was still tight. Hengyu eagerly purchased, and Fuchang, Daxing, and Yong Qianchangxiang advanced further. Although Maijiali offered 3125 US dollars for October, HSBC wanted to accept it but failed, so the price rose to 24.5 yuan. The noon closing was 833.3 yuan, and the goods were auctioned for 1.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 836 yuan, and goods opened at 5 yuan. (The raw plate, China, Huabi, and HSBC sold to the Dalian gang 25 US dollars for October and then 1875. It was difficult to settle, so Shunli advanced the period standard, and Hengyu also purchased.) Hongli sold at 4.5 yuan, but Shunli vigorously purchased. Hengxing, Daxing, and Yong also advanced. Huabi took 1875 US dollars for October, but it was also difficult to obtain. Yuanxing and Yong Daxing and Yong also purchased, and the price rose to 37 yuan. Shanghai and Zhejiang plugged in 125 US dollars for October. Hengyu sold and the price fell. Goods were strongly lifted. Sassoon offered Huabi 1875 for October and the price fell back to 4 yuan. Shunli, Fuchang, and Wanxing advanced again. Datong took 3125 US dollars for November and the price rebounded to 6.2 yuan. Hengyu continued to sell. Qianchangxiang supplied vigorously. There were few buyers for 1875 US dollars for October, and the price fell to 2.8 yuan. Shunli, Fuchang, Zhaofengchang, Daxing, and Yong advanced again. Pangen took 1875 US dollars for October and the price rose again to 5.8 yuan. Hengyu, Zhaofengchang, Hengtai, and Yongfeng feared selling. The closing price fell back to 834.5 yuan, and goods were auctioned for 5.5 yuan. However, after entering, the price was frustrated by the sale of the strip by No. 121 (Changshengyong). In addition, Shunli and Wanxing also supplied slightly, at around 4.5 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the day was 837 yuan and the lowest was 824 yuan, a fluctuation of 13 yuan. As a result, the price rebounded by 22.5 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The quoted price was 849.56 yuan due to the 25 reduction in the US exchange rate quoted by HSBC, which was 28.25 yuan. In terms of the closing price, it was about 15 yuan higher, which was 15 yuan lower than the previous closing. The account checking for this month was 845 yuan, for August it was 838 yuan, and for September it was 833 yuan. The supplementary water in the morning was 845 yuan, and the supplementary water in the afternoon was 847 yuan. The quick price was increased by 200 yuan. The Tianjin spot source was very abundant, and it was not known whether it came from Dalian. Tongfenghang had accepted and increased the price by 210 yuan, which was sold by Wanxing on behalf of a customer, with a transaction of 150 taels. However, there were many suppliers at this price. There were still 2,331 strips remaining for this month and 777 strips for August.</p>
<p>There were many eager buyers in the market. In summary, Hengxing, Wanxing, Shunli, Daxing, Yong, Yuanxing, Yong Yifengyong, Xiexing Yong, Shunmao, Hengyu, and Fuchang all advanced. Qianchangxiang, Zhaofengchang, Yongfeng, Hengtai, Ruixing, Xianghe, Yuanfeng, Yongdafa, Yong Hongli sold. The Dalian gang Wanxing advanced a total of 1,890 strips before and after the market and sold more than 800. Shunli advanced a total of more than 1,800 and sold more than 700. The Guangdong gang Hengxing did not trade much, and only advanced slightly. In addition, Qianchangxianghengxing advanced first and then sold, and Yifeng Yongshunli sold first and then advanced. The total number of chips for September was 18,221.</p>

<p>Business Market Quiet</p>
<h3 id="e273">Difficult Development for Silver and Banking Industries <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>The call loan market remains consistently calm... Collections were tight, but simple and moderate</p>
<p>Recently, the silver and banking industries have felt the decline of all industries, and the market atmosphere is very quiet. It is naturally difficult to extend loans. Therefore, in recent days, besides being at a loss for what to do, there have been no fresh records. The interbank call loan rates in the market remained unchanged. The morning and afternoon rates were both 5%, and there was no increase in the interest rate for overdrafts, all being handled as regular overdrafts. The loose and excessive situation of silver and dollar reserves has reached an extreme point. Although the transaction of call loan tickets was slightly better than the previous day, it was ultimately not strong. In the morning market, over 4.5 million was transferred and there was over 700,000 in new transactions. In the afternoon market, the transaction was over 500,000, and the transaction in the Small General Association was over 700,000. The transaction of silver dollar pledges involved over 300,000 in redemptions and 5-600,000 in new pledges, totaling no more than 900,000. The inflow and outflow of bank notes showed that the recovery was less and the issuance was more yesterday, totaling no more than 1.3-1.4 million. Bank collections included over 1.5 million in silver for foreign merchants' collection tickets, over 2.1 million in foreign dollars, 3.5-3.6 million in silver for goods exchange and pledge and miscellaneous collections, 3.7-3.8 million in foreign dollars, and over 1.7 million in special collections. 100,000 in silver returned from warehouses and 500,000 in foreign dollars entered warehouses. Chinese merchant bank collections included 2.4-2.5 million in collection tickets, over 4.1 million in various goods, exchange, tax, miscellaneous pledges, and advances collections, 2.4-2.5 million in special collections, and 600,000 went out of warehouses. Japanese merchant bank deposits totaled 500,000 in silver and 300,000 in foreign dollars. Money shops collected over 32.2 million in foreign dollar public notes and over 5.7 million in foreign dollar overdraft collections, over 400,000 in various remittance collections, 3-400,000 in cash payments, and 200,000 in client overdrafts. Furthermore, the total exchange amount in the city's clearing house on the 28th was 16,666,046.67 silver dollars, including 3,246,884.53 silver dollars and 13,419,162.14 silver dollars in remittance transfers.</p>
<h3 id="e274">Guangdong Small Dollars Still Being Eagerly Purchased <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>In the money market, small money shops were engaged in the Jiangnan small dollar business. Since a surge in the afternoon market the day before yesterday, there has been no rise or fall yesterday. The morning and afternoon markets remained at the same price as the previous afternoon, at 845 yuan, and the transaction volume was not high, at 9,000 jiao in the morning market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market. However, yesterday morning, the Guangdong small dollar continued to be purchased eagerly, causing the price to rise by 8 jiao compared to the previous afternoon, amounting to 776 yuan. In the afternoon market, both supply and demand were sluggish, and the price was the same as in the morning market. The transaction volume was 175,000 jiao in the morning market and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins rose slightly by 500 wen, amounting to 317,500 wen, with 40,640 strings transacted, equivalent to 12,800 foreign dollars.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>July Futures Bonds</p>
<h3 id="e275">Settlement Process Extremely Smooth <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Total Amounted to 33,395,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Deliveries Primarily by Financial Institutions, with Many Retail Investors</p>
<p>Yesterday was the settlement date for the July futures contracts on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange. The settlement volume did not decrease due to the change to half-day trading. The total volume was 33,395,000 yuan, an increase of 4 million yuan compared to the previous month. Among these, 22,885,000 yuan was settled through internal bookkeeping between brokers and private settlements. The actual amount settled on the exchange was 10,510,000 yuan. Although the number of off-exchange settlements by brokers is unverifiable, the quantity should not be less than 15 million. Receivers were mostly financial institutions and certain savings associations. Deliverers were mostly retail investors. Arbitrage transactions were less than the previous month. The settlement process was quite smooth, mainly due to the abundance of silver and a favorable environment. Receivers mostly benefited, and deliverers mostly suffered losses based on market prices. The overall market price trend was gradually upward, with no major fluctuations or swings. The difference between the highest and lowest prices was mostly around 12 yuan, while the difference for Positive Six (referring to a specific bond type) was over 17 yuan. Tracing back to May 27, when the July futures were first introduced, the salt tax market was at 44.45 yuan. The highest price on July 19 was 55.75 yuan. The lowest price on May 31 was 43 yuan, with a difference of 12.75 yuan between the highest and lowest prices. The highest price for Positive Six was 60 yuan, and the lowest was 42.8 yuan, with a difference of 17.2 yuan. This was because after the Ministry of Finance revised Positive Six, its treatment improved, and its total amount was only over 32 million, leading to increased demand and a price increase. Examining the trend of the process, it was indeed due to a favorable environment that led to this. The upward trend was almost a straight line. After the signing of the Sino-Japanese agreement, although there were still unfavorable news such as the insubordination of puppet troops, the difficulty of receiving North China, and the Feng army using the pretext of resisting Japan to occupy Chahar, these had little impact on the high and low market prices. Since news of the establishment of the Sino-British loan was spread, the bulls became more concentrated, and the market price directly advanced to a peak. New high prices were frequently seen. The 96 public bonds, which had long been unattended to, suddenly turned from cold to hot. On June 2, the market price was only 4.9 jiao, but it rose to as high as 21-22 yuan on July 8. Eventually, due to rumors of no interest payment and the influx of spot goods, it recently fluctuated around 8-9 yuan. The turbulence within this was relatively treacherous, and transactions were also extremely active. The total transaction volume of various July futures was 31,170,000 yuan. 96 even had 3,091 yuan, accounting for one-tenth of the total. The total transaction volume increased by 19.47 million compared to June. The settlement, clearing, and transaction volume of various bonds in July are listed below (unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>New Feng Foreign Firm Report: On Thursday (27th), the New York stock market was mixed. Steel, railway, and agricultural equipment stocks were very strong. The market resisted selling pressure well, and later, short covering led to a slight increase. Speculators were quite cautious, but trading was still more active than the previous day. The total daily trading volume was 2.46 million shares. Wheat soared due to the unusual heat in the Northwest and continued damage to Canadian wheat varieties. The market slightly reacted at the close, and the market conditions seemed to continue to rise. It was possible to buy in on reactions. U.S. cotton still had little change, and the market price followed small fluctuations in trading and other markets. The rumored government purchase had not materialized. The Dow Jones indices are listed on the left.</p>

<p>The yarn market remains weak. Although U.S. cotton has risen, people's hearts have not been stirred. Due to the domestic economic decline, agricultural bankruptcy, sluggish yarn sales, and difficulty in reducing inventory, how can the market rise? A certain factory, seeing the unfavorable environment, closed out its large position. However, there is a rumor that some who were long are not letting go.</p>

<p>Before the tag market opened, U.S. cotton rose, and there were buyers. After auctioning for two or three rounds, a certain factory closed out its position. It was heard that spot demand was not smooth, and a downward trend began slightly, falling 9.2 to 4.2 jiao. The total transactions were 15,800 bales. Mingde sold 950 bales, Rui Da sold 900 bales, Yuan Da sold 850 bales, and Ji Feng sold 650 bales. Yuan De bought 1,050 bales, Chang Feng bought 1,200 bales, Xinhua bought 450 bales, and Da Feng bought 400 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>The spot yarn sales market is quite sluggish. According to statistics, all gangs bought only 400 bales for the whole day. The market price was average. The purchase amounts of each gang are as follows: 40 for inland, 15 for North, 35 for traders, 295 for Guangdong, 15 for Jiangxi.</p>
<p>The cotton market is gradually softening, but foreign cotton prices are rising, and exchange rates are also shrinking. However, the Shanghai market has not been affected, and the situation is rather weak. In fact, due to the favorable weather recently, all new cotton areas have reported good news. Among agricultural product prices, cotton is the most expensive, but the yarn market is sluggish. How can factories purchase raw materials? Because of this, a certain large merchant slightly sold off in the futures market, and the market suddenly fell.</p>

<p>At the opening of the Zheng Tag market, it followed a one-jiao increase in foreign cotton prices. Later, due to manufacturers selling off, the market fell back. Each month fell by 1.2 jiao. The total transaction volume was 25,800 dan. Hengde sold 3,500 dan, Rui Da sold 2,600 dan, Zhen Da sold 1,000 dan, and Li Chang sold 900 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market was mixed. It was initially weak due to long liquidation, but later rose due to strength on Wall Street. As a result, spot prices rose 25 points per pound, and futures prices rose 26 to 30 points per pound. The Liverpool cotton market saw spot prices rise 12 points and futures prices rise 13-14 points. The Egyptian cotton market saw spot prices rise 7 points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to the firm opening of the Liverpool market. As a result, Pingar rose 2 rupees 2 annas firmly, and Olmura and Bairasi both rose 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 27th):</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's supply came from over twenty firms. Both retail and wholesale demand were sluggish, so the situation was quiet and the market continued to be weak. According to statistics, both the Northern and Southern gangs of foreign merchants purchased over 1,000 bags of thin rice. All kinds of thick japonica, thin rice, and Du Yangjian prices fell by a few corners. Yuan was stable, with no gains or losses. The price of Xin Chang Factory's Pudong Xin Geng (newly harvested) rice also slightly decreased.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various areas under the river came from seventeen or eighteen firms. The sales of white japonica remained sluggish, and the market price slightly decreased by one or two corners. The price of thin japonica decreased. Early rice was short one or two chi, and Yangjian's arrival was less and sales were stagnant, so the price dropped slightly. Du Jian decreased by one corner, and Yuan and Ke Jian did not arrive in large quantities. Sales were slow, and the market continued to decline day by day. About forty shi of Dong Xin Geng arrived, and the price decreased slightly by one corner.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Early Rice from Various Areas Listed Sequentially <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>丨Tianjin Merchants Trying Hunan Red Rice丨</p>
<p>Since the first batches of early rice from various areas were listed successively, the early rice that ripens in summer from Anhui and Hunan will arrive, including Jiangzhe's Guashu rice and Guanyin rice. Although the quantity is small, it is only for decoration in the retail market and cannot meet the sales demand. However, in times of market softness, it can easily affect the market. Yesterday, the Zhejiang merchants from Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and Shaoxing actively purchased. In addition to the Northern merchants from Tianjin and other areas purchasing thin rice and other japonica rice, there was also a demand for indica rice. 160 bags of Hunan machine red rice arrived in the market for a trial sale, priced at 7.24 yuan. If it is suitable, there is a potential for continued purchase. Merchants from Ningbo and Shaoxing purchased 200 bags of Hunan machine oil at 7.45 yuan. Merchants from Wenzhou and Taizhou purchased 430 bags of Wuxi machine indica at 6.4 yuan, and 446 bags of rough indica at 5.65 yuan to 5.35 yuan. The price was similar to the previous market, and the situation was stable.</p>
<h3 id="e286">Futures Flour Mostly Accommodating Business <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market presented a pattern of initial firmness followed by decline. Due to the quotation of foreign wheat and the manufacturers' hedging of near-term positions, the near-term price had been raised by 7.5 li. However, the current actual sales were exceptionally quiet. Northern merchants only had accommodating transactions, and no wholesale sales were heard. Therefore, the perception of futures was naturally cold, so all months rotated back. The market atmosphere then reported a collapse. Observing this situation, although enthusiasts still use the rising international commodity prices as a basis, the domestic sales are also unable to be incorporated. In fact, it has already presented a picture of excess and decline, and it is feared that it will be difficult to maintain for a while. As a result, this month fell by 1.25 fen, August fell by 2 fen, September fell by 1.25 fen, October and November fell by 0.5 li, and December fell by 2.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e287">Foreign Wheat Soared, Local Wheat Turned Down <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>丨Domestic Bumper Harvest丨Eager to Sell</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the quotation of foreign wheat was still rising greatly, Chicago rose by 2.56 yuan and Canada rose by 1.45 yuan, the local wheat market was actually felt to be bleak. Because some flour mills have foreign wheat and three ships of foreign wheat have recently arrived (currently being unloaded), there is a wait-and-see attitude towards local wheat. Initially, customers were selling on the basis of rising foreign wheat prices, but now seeing the unfavorable market situation and because early-ripening wheat will soon be on the market and forecasts report another bumper harvest, those with spot goods are all rushing to hedge on the exchange. Therefore, amidst the rising prices of foreign wheat, the local market is showing a declining trend. As a result, August fell by 3 fen, September fell by 9 fen, November fell by 7 fen, and December fell by 6 fen. In the current wheat market, there is a rush of goods from all areas, but the mills' flour sales are very light and they are not interested in buying. All intend to sell short by 5 fen, but the merchants are unwilling to match the price, so there are no transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e288">Sugar Market Consistently Rising <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise due to the continued rise in tagged gold. The Guild's listed price for 24 coarse sand white sugar also rose by 5 fen to a listed price of 20.3 yuan. The number of transactions was high. Furthermore, more than 2,000 bags of imported goods were offered, initially at 7.68 yuan, and later rising to 7.7 yuan (foreign tax). Sufficient number 20 medium sand white sugar remained at 19.8 yuan, 8-9 grade Dutch red was 16.25 yuan. Factory prices included China's offering of grade 1 ice at 22.2 yuan and grade 2 at 23 yuan, each rising by 1 jiao. Crystal ice and grade 3 prices were flat. Grade number 1 cotton white was 19.8 yuan, grade 1 was 6 jiao, grade 2 was 4 jiao, grade 3 was 2 jiao, and grade 4 was 19 yuan. Guohua's prices were the same. Zhenji's grade 1 cotton white was 19.6 yuan, and grades 2, 3, 4, and 5 were priced accordingly. Chao merchants offered dozens of newly arrived Ti Zhuang Qing, at 14.65 yuan, up 5 fen from before. Also offered more than 100 bags of Huanggang Qing, also up 14.3 yuan to 1 jiao. The original Hong Kong ice flower Qing was offered at 16.9 yuan, a good starting point for half a jiao.</p>

<p>Several batches of Xu Kuizi's new goods continued to arrive, initially opening at 14.5 yuan, and then opening at 14 yuan. In total, it fell by 1 yuan.</p>
<p>New orchid bamboo branches have been weak because of the increased arrivals. Yesterday, Da Lai and other shops offered more than 400 boxes in total. The decline of higher-grade goods was slower, opening at 31.5 yuan. Those that were second-best were around 30 yuan. The rest were declining, dropping by 2-3 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>

<p>The high-grade Core-Extracted Precious Eyebrow green tea from various tea estates has recently been enthusiastically sought after by British merchants and foreign firms.

The market for Xixi Precious Eyebrow has been active recently. The top price for goods from the Northern Road has already been opened at 154 yuan. Needle Eyebrow Gongxi Zhucha and other varieties are also selling well. The green tea market is becoming increasingly firm. However, although Qimen black tea had once rebounded, the market has been quiet again because there were no positive news from London.</p>

<h3 id="e293">Examining Old Accounts <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Traveler Falcon</p>
<p>These past few days, I've heard that the Xun Society has published a book, "Words of the Meat-Eaters," which contains the current officials' pronouncements from when they were still out of power. It encourages everyone to "observe their actions based on their words," to see how different they are before and after. The weekly publication "New Voice" from the same society often has articles with the same message.</p>
<p>This is like examining old accounts, opening the ledgers, and tallying up the figures to give a final calculation. It asks how there can be inconsistencies between past and present, and it is indeed a most practical and clear method that leaves no room for evasion. However, this method seems a bit too "old-fashioned" for the present day.</p>
<p>The ancients were afraid of having these kinds of old accounts examined. Wei Zhuang of Shu, when he was poor, wrote a passionate and relatively accessible poem called "Qin Woman Now," which everyone truly passed around. But after he became prominent, he not only refused to include it in his collection, but even tried to destroy others' copies. The reason for this was unknown at the time, but seeing that this manuscript was excavated from the caves of Dunhuang at the end of the Qing Dynasty, it's clear that his efforts were in vain. Nevertheless, his anxieties are understandable.</p>
<p>However, this applies to famous figures of the past. Ordinary people are different. To erase their old accounts, they must cut off their heads and be reborn. When condemned criminals are taken to the execution grounds, they shout, "In twenty years, I'll be a good man again!" To start anew, they must wait twenty years, which is quite troublesome.</p>
<p>However, this is the case for ordinary people of both past and present. Today's celebrities are different. To erase their old accounts and start anew, their methods are as different from those of ordinary people as mail is from telegrams. If they don't mind being slow, they can go abroad once, build a temple, have an illness, or tour the mountains for a few days. If they want to be quick, they can hold a conference, recite a sutra, give a speech, make a declaration, or even just sleep for a night and write a poem. If they want to be even quicker, they can slap themselves twice, shed a few tears, and transform into a completely different person, with no connection to their "former self." General Pure Altar transforms into a carp and swims between the legs of female demons. The author may have thought he was writing something wonderfully imaginative, but from today's perspective, it lacks even a hint of novelty.</p>
<p>If these transformations still seem troublesome, they can roll their eyes and ask, "Are these my accounts?" If that's still too much trouble, they can skip the eye-rolling and questioning altogether. This last method is largely what's in vogue today.</p>
<p>How can "old-fashioned" methods be used in today's world? Some people even advocate reading the classics, which is baffling. However, overnight, they might advocate that everyone join the army, so I haven't bought any classics, and I probably won't be enlisting tomorrow either.</p>
<h3 id="e294">On "Famine" Works (Continued) <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Wu</p>
<p>This "main element," which Ye Shaojun overlooked, is strongly emphasized in Bai Wei's play "Famine." However, "Famine," like "More Than Three or Five Bushels," has many flaws. Specifically, first, the author does not have a good understanding of the structure of rural society. Therefore, a "poor" peasant family can have a beautiful urban female student, merchants rely on farmers to cover up economic exploitation by the government, officials completely adopt direct persecution of farmers, wealthy gentry do not even have the courage to directly confront farmers, and the only connection to imperialism in rural bankruptcy is the shipment of rice. Second, many of the author's descriptions lack authenticity. In terms of characters, it can be said that the author's depictions are completely intellectuals in disguise, especially the "second son," who is simply a typical wavering petty bourgeois. Third, the author's story is romanticized. A poor peasant family has an urban female student, who also has a cousin who is an official, and that cousin is both pursuing the woman and attacking her family. After her family is ruined, he comes to pursue her in love. In terms of social organization, this kind of situation would never exist. Therefore, although Bai Wei's play has good intentions and involved great effort, due to insufficient understanding and lack of life experience, it inevitably has some failures.</p>
<p>In comparison, Mao Dun's "Autumn Harvest" is quite successful. When reading this piece in conjunction with "Spring Silkworms" and "Late Winter," at least three characteristics can be pointed out. First, it develops a depiction of the growth of the peasants. From striving for "survival" to hunger in a year of good harvest, from awareness in hunger to "eating the wealthy households" and "robbing rice stores," and from "eating the wealthy households" and "robbing rice stores" to gradual organization and "handing in firearms," it depicts the process step by step. Second, it shows the convergence of the rural hungry masses. In the novel, he not only wrote about the complexity of the peasants' consciousness, but also wrote about how peasants with such complexity gradually converged under the common oppression of hunger. Ultimately, even the extremely stubborn Old Tongbao had to say when he was dying: "I never thought you (Little Bean Head) were right. It's really strange!" Third, the author powerfully imaged everything, rather than writing mechanically. Art, of course, is imagery-based, and since many new writers cannot do this, I specially emphasize this point. For example, on the aspect of imperialist aggression against the countryside, he does not present it philosophically or with slogans, but writes about Old Tongbao's dislike of "foreign things," which is a good example. As for the fact that urban and rural areas alike have no escape and can only unite to strive for "new life," this is, of course, also one of the important advantages. However, after reading "Midnight" and these novels, I cannot help but express my feelings about the author of "Autumn Harvest," and I cannot help but have further hopes. Namely, first, as a representative of progressive writers, the author has not yet been able to find revolutionary opportunities from the myriad of realities and portray them as revolutionary themes, exerting the positiveness of the theme to complete the task that progressive writers inevitably undertake. Second, the author's non-dialectical, supra-class, purely objectivist attitude has constantly prevented the author from understanding events more deeply, and created a crisis of moving towards mechanical materialism. These two problems are also a problem of understanding and observation methods. If the author can arduously study dialectical materialism, and only dialectical materialism can overcome pure objectivism and subjectivism, I think the author's driving force for the development of the entire literary movement will be ten or a hundred times greater than it is now.</p>

<p>— Ye Rong</p>
<p>Ah Da walked in from outside the door, nodded at me, and sat down solemnly. My wife hurriedly put down the child, got up to pour a cup of tea, and delivered it to the table with a smiling face, saying, "Master, have some tea."</p>
<p>I immediately understood why he had come. I lowered my head and twisted the straw rope for making a winnowing basket, waiting for him to speak first. I didn't know how I could send him away today. Ah Da wasn't easy to talk to; he had a menacing face.</p>
<p>He picked up the tea from the table, took a sip, and his lips trembled a few times, as if the tea had stung him. He opened his mouth hesitantly:</p>
<p>"Monk, I, I've come, you, you know why. That one, one hundred yuan in rent you owe, today you promise tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow you promise the day after tomorrow. When, when will you, will you pay? You're making me run back and forth."</p>
<p>I felt speechless. Every time he came, I used up all my good words, and repeated them so many times that even I felt pressured. And as soon as I opened my mouth, he would cut me off, saying, "I've heard enough of this. You, you just tell me, do, do you have it today?" I'd heard enough of his words too.</p>
<p>"Why don't you, don't you answer?" He started to get angry, pounding the table. My wife was frightened, and the child was startled by the noise and started to cry.</p>
<p>"Master!" My wife called out to him timidly, but couldn't say anything more, as if begging him to spare me, or perhaps asking him not to bang on the table and scare the child.</p>
<p>"You, you don't answer, won't, won't do. Boss, says, if you don't have it today, he'll tell me to take you, to, to the security corps."</p>
<p>To the security corps, then so be it. I steeled my heart and replied, "I really don't have it today."</p>
<p>"No, no, you don't have it, is that right? Fine. You wait right here." As he spoke, he stood up. My wife, afraid that he would grab me, quickly stood up between us. But he waved his hand, stepped out of my door in two strides, and left. My wife looked at me with frightened eyes, as if asking, what will he do?</p>
<p>He left so quickly today, which made me really uneasy. I twisted the straw rope that was almost finished, my heart thumping. What will happen today?······</p>
<p>My wife didn't know when she had left the child in the straw nest. He suddenly started to cry loudly. I called out to her, but there was no response. I got angry, jumped up, and rushed to the back to find her. However, she wasn't there. I looked out the back door, the small river behind the house was flowing gurglingly. The wind blew the willow branches, rustling. A group of refugees ran over from the other side in a panic. San'er, from next door, holding a whip, breathing heavily, saw me and stopped at a distance, shouting:</p>
<p>"Hurry, hurry, your wife jumped into the river."</p>
<p>My heart panicked, and my legs went weak. But I dragged my heavy legs, following San'er. The shore of the harbor was already full of people. I saw someone pull her out of the water, her clothes soaking wet, clinging tightly to her body, her head hanging backward.</p>
<p>It's over, it's over! Before I could reach her, I felt something in my chest, hard and painful. I went up to take a look. Alas, her eyes were closed, her belly bloated with water, lying on the ground. I heard someone say: "She's dead. It was too long."</p>
<p>My chest seemed to explode, and I opened my mouth and vomited. I heard someone shout: Blood!</p>
<p>I fell to the ground.······</p>
<p>I vaguely saw Ah Da with his menacing face standing in the crowd. I shouted angrily: "This is a blood debt!"</p>

<p>— 𣽃 Guo Sun</p>
<p>"Has your household expenses increased or decreased lately compared to before?"</p>
<p>"Alas, how could they decrease!" Bo Tang sighed. "The other expenses haven't increased, but the cost of food has!"</p>
<p>"Roughly how much has it increased per month?"</p>
<p>"It's quite considerable! Now we have two meals a day, serving fourteen tables each time. Each table costs around 1.5 yuan, not counting the rice. That's 21 yuan a day, 630 yuan a month. The side dishes and rice cost over 200 yuan a month. So the food expenses alone are 900 yuan a month! Before, it was less than 200 yuan!"</p>
<p>"How long can you sustain this kind of provision?"</p>
<p>"Nobody knows! Presumably, the refugees here will stay until the fighting stops! Most of them have nowhere to move. The only option is to return home, but nobody is willing to go home anytime soon, and I would have to fund their journey back anyway. So, I need to prepare for at least two months' worth of food expenses."</p>
<p>"Adding in the other household expenses..."</p>
<p>"Then it's at least 1400 to 1500 yuan per month!"</p>
<p>"Preparing for two months would cost 3000 yuan!"</p>
<p>"That's just for my family. What about 'Old Master's' family?"</p>
<p>"How much is that per month?"</p>
<p>"Including household expenses and 'Old Master's' entertainment, it's at least 1500 yuan."</p>
<p>"At least?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps I should say approximately, because sometimes 'Old Master' is a bit more generous and tells me to delay payment for a while. But I should prepare that amount monthly to be ready when he asks."</p>
<p>"Then preparing for two months would also cost 3000 yuan!"</p>
<p>"Both items total 6000 yuan. Adding the 13000 yuan needed for the factory."</p>
<p>"That's the amount going out. How much can you expect to come in during these two months?"</p>
<p>"Coming in? Alas! As you know, the only income I can count on is the 3000 yuan that Zheng Yuan promised by the middle of this month. Aside from that, there's no other money coming in!"</p>
<p>"So, even with the 9000+ yuan from the factory, it's still less than 13000 yuan! If the situation continues, you'll need to find another solution!"</p>
<p>"There's no good solution here in this city! All our properties have been mortgaged. Although we could increase the mortgage, there's no way to manage the situation, so we can't increase the mortgage. Then we'll have to rely on pawnshops in other cities for help. However, the two branches in Nanjing and Zhenjiang have already put up 'stop pawning' signs because refugees are crowding the shops. They can't help us anymore. The branches in Ningbo and Shaoxing might have some surplus if the war zone doesn't expand further, but that's not something we can count on now."</p>
<p>As Bo Tang said this, Zhi Guang also felt dispirited. They looked at each other for a long time without saying a word. Finally, Bo Tang stood up, scratched his head, and then said as he sat down again:</p>

<p>— I</p>
<p>The term "Higher-Class Chinese" is certainly not as stiff and grating as "Long Gown Comrade," because the former is already documented in historical records. If scholars want to cite classics to support it, it's very easy.</p>
<p>However, Higher-Class Chinese and Long Gown Comrades are quite different, and it's obvious. Just in terms of appearance, Higher-Class Chinese often love to wear Western suits, looking no different from foreigners. And they are very particular about it. For example, they should wear light colors in the summer, brown or gray in the autumn, and naturally dark gray or black in the winter. As for matching ties and shoes with the color of the suit, that goes without saying. But that's not to say that every Higher-Class Chinese loves to wear Western suits. To show their Chinese identity, the long gown and Mandarin jacket are also suitable, but only occasionally.</p>
<p>Higher-Class Chinese can mostly say a few words of English, and are good at interacting with foreigners politely, bowing and shaking hands. Most of them have traveled abroad, or even studied there for a few years. They know quite a bit about foreign cultures and scenery. For example, they know that Christmas is on December 25th, and that day is Foreign Qingming, and they probably won't get it wrong. Their speech and actions can't lack some foreign air. Because they are used to interacting with foreign masters, they carry walking sticks, wear crooked hats, and the most fashionable thing is to replace "Alright" with "OK."</p>
<p>Needless to say, they are subordinate to the power of foreigners. To put it more plainly, they are happy to work in foreign companies and firms in China. Secondarily, they are also willing to invest in joint Sino-foreign ventures. As for their own silver ingots and paper money, they must be deposited in foreign banks, because they seem to be more reliable. They are always very indignant about the chaos and mess of everything Chinese. They certainly curse and swear at bandits and kidnapping, and they can't help but hiss at the rustic Chinese officials. They often have an unspeakable pain when it comes to the recovery of roads built beyond the concession or the recovery of the concession, because it is both inconvenient to openly oppose it, and they are very worried about the weakening of the power of imperialism. Fortunately, high-profile calls for the recovery of roads built beyond the concession, etc., are just sung occasionally and will never really become reality, so they don't have to end up depressed. In short, they are interdependent with blue-eyed and high-nosed foreigners. As long as the power of foreigners in China is not eliminated, their existence will be extended by one day.</p>
<p>Clearly, they have significant power in China. Scolding servants in English is just the most ordinary expression of their authority. Most importantly, powerful officials also rely on them.</p>
<p>Since the Chinese are called Higher-Class, then their lives are naturally superior. For example, the "First Class" section of the tram is set up for them and their masters. They live in three-story houses, drive Buick cars, and take their concubines for a spin on the Great Fool Garden Road, which is both leisurely and spirited. Alas, alas, that's all.</p>

<h3 id="e299">My View on Long Gown Comrades <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>After reading your piece, Mr. Wu, on "Long Gown Comrades," perhaps because I am somewhat close to this group, I couldn't help but feel disoriented for a long time, as Mr. Wu has scratched an itch.</p>
<p>Indeed, the current Long Gown Comrades, their lives, their consciousness, everything about them, are acting in extreme contradiction. But we need to ask a question: why are they so contradictory? The answer is: "This is created by the times!" Furthermore, what is the social foundation of all this? Where is the fundamental mistake? This seems to require some systematic explanation.</p>
<p>In the past, in China, so-called Long Gown Comrades, although not all belonged to the ranks of Hedda, wearing red hats and flower dragon robes, and going in and out of temples and palaces, certainly had a solid foundation in society. This foundation was the vast and wealthy countryside. They gathered the spit of ancient sages, infiltrated the "virtuous governance" of the heavenly king (?), and specialized in cultural suppression and anesthesia for the ruling class. In other words, the Long Gown Comrades of past dynasties were all spokespersons for the royal family, demons that suppressed freedom of thought, snails that maintained the status quo, using this to seek rewards from the emperor. Occasionally, they would be lucky and climb the dragon gate to occupy important positions. Otherwise, they could also raise the ghostly flags of "scholars" and "recommended men," running rampant in society, flaunting and deceiving, sucking the blood and sweat of farmers throughout their lives.</p>
<p>This is the "scholar-official class" that Professor Tao Xisheng never tires of talking about. According to historical laws, this kind of person can only exist and have power in a feudal society based on an agricultural economy. When it declines to a commercial capitalist society, it can still maintain its life to a considerable extent. But once it reaches today's industrial and commercial capitalist society, they are like beads cut off from a string, blindly rolling without direction. Capitalists do not</p>
<p>need you, the capacity of the ruling class is also limited, and they are most afraid of you not being loyal. In this situation, they cannot go up, nor can they go down. Retreating is not worth it, and advancing lacks courage. They hesitate and wander all day long. Therefore, their lives, their consciousness, everything about them, fall into contradiction.</p>
<p>Because they wear long gowns, they are ultimately smarter than people of the lower classes. Their desire for a comfortable life is almost comparable to that of the upper classes. They don't care about the millions of people living below them, only dreaming of their own comfort day and night. However, because the upper-class capitalists heavily exploit them, their desires cannot be fulfilled. Therefore, they suffer, suffer, and cry endlessly.</p>
<p>Because of this contradiction in life, their consciousness becomes even more radically contradictory. They uphold false and reserved pretenses, deliberately learning from the upper classes. Even if they cannot rise, they still want to maintain their own class. When this wish cannot be achieved, they experience another degree of pain in consciousness.</p>
<p>Indeed, the current Long Gown Comrades are extremely pained, and the future is even more pitch black.</p>
<p>But if they can thoroughly awaken and strive for self-rescue, it is not entirely without hope. However, they first need to recognize two points:</p>
<p>㈠ The old "scholar-official class" has already declined, and the possibility of establishing a new "scholar-official class" is absolutely impossible. Don't dream of class preservation, let alone dream of class</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>ascension, because this is a dream that the times will absolutely not allow. They should urgently transform their petty bourgeois consciousness into proletarian consciousness, or at least pursue in that direction.</p>
<p>㈡ The evolution of society is gradually trending towards technical expertise. Relying solely on empty talk is no longer practical. They should use the spirit of labor to pursue a general technical life, not being ashamed to join hands with laborers, not being ashamed to be with laborers, and exposing all their hypocrisy.</p>
<p>In this way, even if the times are turbulent and shaking, I think the Long Gown Comrades will not only not be terrified in the future, but will also be able to stand firmly in a corner of society.</p>

<p>Mr. Tang Yifang's Painting (Brief Biography)</p>
<p>Tang Chao, styled Yifang, alias Li, learned his trade at a money shop in his youth. He studied landscape painting for five or six years. When Mr. Fei Junlong and Ding saw his work, they were amazed, considering him a reincarnation of Shi Gu (Wang Hui). They took him to Shancao Studio to meet Master Feng Chaoran. The master instructed him in everything. Mr. Tang possessed inherent wisdom and grasped things uniquely. He mastered landscape, flowers, birds, figures, and elegant women, receiving all the master's teachings. His reputation flourished, and those seeking his paintings flocked to his door daily. Since the Daoguang and Xianfeng eras, the Yun Jian School has been revived by Bu Yi Zhang Shangshu, who was able to invigorate the declining tradition and benefit scholars. Now, Tang is the most promising successor. Mr. Tang excels in iron-brush calligraphy, deeply capturing the essence of Ding and Deng.</p>

<h3 id="e301">Under the Traffic Lights (39) <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>The car sped towards the countryside, which was already rippling with the verdant green of spring. The warm air of the sun had summoned many birds and bees into the air, and the languid wind blew willows wrapped around the white plums. Li Shiqiao kept looking out the car window. It was as if he was seeing spring, the beautiful spring, for the first time. He even doubted that this gentle spring still existed in the world. A new hope infused his blood, which had long been stiffened by the smoky city. He almost wanted to shout for joy.</p>
<p>In the fields, he gradually saw the seemingly endless, winding trenches with barbed wire lines. This was the second line of defense for our army. He secretly admired this great project, and the remnants under the traffic lights in the rear made him curse even more deeply. At this time, he was almost at the Jiangwan position. Looking back at the ruins of the defeated Zhabei, the cannon marks on the rooftops, and the piles of rubble, he couldn't help but clench his teeth and mutter to himself, "We will have our day of revenge!"</p>
<p>(22) Zhou Shaoping on the Front Lines</p>
<p>He got out of the car at the student volunteer army's encampment. The first thing he did was look for Zhou Shaoping, but Zhou Shaoping was no longer in the student army. Because most of the student soldiers lacked practical training and were mainly driven by temporary enthusiasm, they were not suitable for combat. Now the student volunteer army had been reassigned to relief work. Zhou Shaoping, however, was distressed by the fact that he could not go to the front lines, so he independently requested to join the third regiment of the XX division for formal combat. When Li Shiqiao found the position of the third regiment, the soldiers there were crouching in the newly dug yellow earth, fiercely chewing on their meager rations. Only a few sentries remained on the parapet, keeping watch.</p>
<p>On the left, a lookout post was also set up in a small thicket of "extracting trees" to monitor further afield. Suddenly, a squadron of three enemy planes was spotted in the upper right sky. The sound of the planes was unusually heavy, clearly a squadron of bombers. The sentries waved their hands, and the soldiers walking on the road all lay flat on the ground. Li Shiqiao naturally did the same. When the roaring of the planes gradually faded away, he stood up and walked towards the trenches again, but a soldier was walking towards him and saluting him from afar. He focused his attention and realized that the soldier was Zhou Shaoping. The enthusiasm of their meeting was needless to say, they held hands tightly for several minutes without letting go. Zhou Shaoping had completely transformed into an old soldier. The pale shadow of a scholar could no longer be seen in his dark skin. He couldn't help but sincerely praise Zhou Shaoping: "You are truly a young national hero!"</p>
<p>Zhou Shaoping also sincerely returned the compliment:</p>
<p>"Your work in the rear is also very successful! Didn't you invite many people to organize the XXXXX Federation of Organizations?"</p>
