<p>日本前任外交部長故内閣總理犬養　之　芳澤謙咨氏於前日　業日本郵船長崎丸來華據其自己談話則謂﹁此行僅以平民資格來華﹁觀光﹂未奉政府任何使命······亦無外交意見足述但須於還留滬上時期一訪老友王　堂氏······﹂云云就表面觀察芳澤氏此來似眞無所謂使命者然　芳澤氏前任日本駐法大使時正當九一八事變突發彼尚號於國際聯盟曰事態不至擴大迄今往事冋思吾人誠不勝或憤矣一則以我國對日外交在國聯雖已得所謂精神上之勝利而實際上熱河淪陷灤東危急日軍侵華且續進不已内田之﹁化全（日本）國爲焦土在所不惜﹂之外交荒木之﹁無粥吃喝糊塗﹂之軍事政筆直使中日兩國永立於敵對地位絶無絲毫親善可言不　芳澤氏感想何如一則以日本國内自去年五月十五日犬養以現任内閣總理而遭現役軍官之狙擊於是所謂立憲政治者殆已由殘破而至於毁滅芳澤氏若眞屬立憲政治之忠實信徒處此軍閥跋扈之局威眞無所謂﹁使命﹂者歟</p>
<p>然而據一般觀測芳澤氏之來華决不如是簡單據其﹁將往訪老友王儒堂氏﹂及﹁滿洲問題已告一段落中日應速和解﹂等語即可窺知其所謂平民之﹁遊歷觀光﹂者乃外交家之常套語耳吾人試回憶一月二十八慘案發生當時閘北被炸吳淞焚毁松岡洋右未嘗不以私人資格在滬濱奔走直至犬養被害方始返國芳澤雖不同於松岡而其爲老外交家且駐華多年所謂﹁支那通﹂則固公認者也當此緊急關頭我國之眞實態度何如國際間之形勢何如類皆爲日閥所急欲審知故芳澤氏之來至少嘗帶有窺察我國實際情勢之性質或於財政外交尤爲注意亦未可知</p>
<p>吾人於是不能不正告芳澤氏曰中國誠積弱有年軍事實力不如日本政治上復有若干罅隙足致外人不良之映象吾人固不自諱然國民上進思想則蒸蒸日上决非永受外敵之侵略者是以吾人深望芳澤氏第一須知破壞東洋和平首先發動武力鬭爭者决非中國而爲日本試回憶一九三一年九月十八之夜日軍以有準備之部隊襲占瀋陽不出二十四小時并長春吉林皆入於日帝國主義者之手迨國聯方面爭持未决之際錦州龍江併被日騎蹂躪國聯今年二月以四十二票對日本之一票宣告﹁滿洲﹂係屬僞國日本係製造僞國者是則日本爲破壞東洋和平之兇手事甚明矣第二須知九一八事變當時我中國地方負責長官昧於實事拙於應變致三省坐失遺今日之禍啓日本窺伺華北之機遂致熱河不守加重我國之國難然而我中國人民决不甘於亡國觀於東三省境内屢仆屢興再敗再戰餉械俱無之義勇軍拚命奮鬭即可見我國人同仇之一般現在整個的作戰計劃吾人姑置不論而宋哲元軍之勇戰備受我國民愛戴更可推知我民意之所趨縱我國國勢積弱但鬱憤旣久將來必須以一戰雪恥殆在意中决不認一滿洲問題即告一段落﹂也</p>
<p>更有進者芳澤氏不謂﹁中日兩國應速和解但須中國諒解日本之立塲﹂乎然而彼陸相荒木貞夫在其師團長會議席上開頭即謂﹁須認識退出國聯···在時局上之重大意義確立（該師團）管下官民之指導整齊國家總勤員之準備善處時局···﹂則是吾人所知者惟日本之﹁整齊···總動員之準備﹂再證以事實則日軍之齊集熱察冀邊境窺伺灤東動兵多倫日本之立塲端在武力侵略而已故吾人之答覆曰吾人已十分諒解日本以武力輔導蠶食之立場今後我國當竭其全力以與日帝國主義相周旋先算淸此一筆血賑然後乃有和平可言亦請芳澤諒解中國之立塲而已</p>

<p>（記者問）中央决定開放政權、是否係放棄一黨專政、抑係將少數人握有之冶權、歸還多數人之意（孫氏謂）三中全會議决於、二十四年四月召開國民大會現决提前舉行、並提早頒布憲法、但此問題、尚須待本年七月之全國代表大會决定、無所謂開放政權、因憲法旣已提早頒、布、訓政時期約法及中政會　訂之訓政綱領、均失時效、政府已將政權歸還國民、政權旣人民所公有、因無所謂開放也（問）屆時是否放棄一黨專政憲法須明文規定、准許人民自由設立政黨否（答）憲法既頒布人民有集會結社之自由、則設立政黨亦爲憲法所允許之事、在憲法條文上、當然無須有明文規定之必要、</p>
<p>（參政問題)</p>
<p>氏又謂國民參政會組織、現正由立法院審　中、現全國代表大會、提前於七月舉行决定召開臨時國民大會問題、參政會已無召集之必要因國民大會、爲政府最高之機關參政會僅係過渡時期之民意機關故也、如國民大會提前開會、憲法當然須提早公佈、其起草時期、亦須縮短、至國民大會組織法及選舉法、其原則可由下週中政會决定、</p>
<p>（團結禦侮)</p>
<p>政府對日、已無外交可言、蔣公使亦已奉召歸國、此後惟視能抗日而後始有外交此種一貫政策、迄未變更現中央對抗日軍事、首爲鞏固陣地、攻則可收復失地、、守則可保持現有領土、否則守　不能遑論進攻、故能團結一致實爲全國總動員之前題、欲達到目的、又非刷新政治、增加實力不可目今吾人痛心者、中國非純粹統一之國家、政令不能達於邊疆各省地方自治、尚未完成、民意與政府隔閡故多數意見主（一）集中與團結全國民意、提前召開國民大會、提早公布憲法、開放政權（二）刷新政治、使中央與各省、收指臂之效、而能嚴守纪律、（三）勵行地方自冶、溝通民意、此三事完成抗日始有力量、否則一切將爲空談、無補於實際、</p>
<p>（望馮南下)</p>
<p>孫氏最後謂、中央對馮玉祥氏自去年即希望其南下、於函電往返並有人赴張家口敦促　余憶測、馮當能負相當責任、至名義尚未定、</p>
<h3 id="c105">楊永泰談抗日與剿匪 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>國聞社云、豫鄂皖三省剿匪總司令部秘　長楊永泰、前由　赴保定謁將後、復赴北平、視察抗日軍事、日前南下、業於昨日、由京抵滬國聞社記者、特往訪之於其寓邸、與談北方抗日軍事及三省剿匪軍事如左、</p>
<p>（北方抗日軍事)</p>
<p>楊氏謂、自上月五日、承德失守後、關外東北軍、大批向關内退入、蔣委員長鑒於形勢急迫、亟由漢北上、坐鎭保定、以最高權力、調度軍事由宋哲元商震關麟徵徐庭瑤等　極抗禦、一方調動各軍、陸績換防、致敵不得逞、且我軍士氣旺盛、意志堅張、視察所得、可云北方抗日軍事情形頗好、</p>
<p>（三省剿匪工作)</p>
<p>記者復詢抗日期間之三省剿匪情形、楊氏謂、北方正努力抗日、而各省之剿匪工作亦甚緊張、蓋當九一八瀋陽事變發生、贛鄂共匪即乘機蠢動、旋二八滬戰開始、共匪又告反攻今榆關熱河事變以來、亦復如是、日來共匪仍頗猖獗、蔣委員長亦有鑒於是故於北上之前、先赴江西一行、迨佈置就緒始行北上、現在之剿匪工作、取堵截方法、不使竄散分擾、幸閩粤各軍、會剿得力、故蔣委員長所定剿匪計劃、不致受影響、</p>
<p>（劉時代理不確)</p>
<p>記者繼以劉峙代理三省剿匪司令之說、詢諸楊氏、據答、此說前曾屢見報載、惟並非事實劉經扶（峙）代理三省剿匪司令之說、完全不確、至蔣委員長北上後之三省剿匪工作、有司令部人員及參謀長負責、</p>
<p>（蔣來滬否未定)</p>
<p>記者問、蔣委員長來滬日期、據答、前數日在京、曾聞有來滬之意、惟日後是否來滬及其日期、則未聞有所决定、至蔣委員長離京後仍將北上、一時不克返漢、至本人（楊氏）亦將再北上一次然後返漢云云、</p>

<p>丨本埠徐先孚君來信丨</p>
<p>十四日革草奉覆一函猶未能暢所欲言今敢再陳陋見以質高明先生其許我乎</p>
<p>迭次上書皆以民族大衆爲懷凡所論列自忖較自殺纞愛職業遺産等問題實勝一籌蓋後者以個人私己爲對象非爲整個民族全體民衆所切需也或曰此數問題者固屬之個人私己要亦爲社會環境有以使然救濟云者亦正﹁積私爲公﹂之義孰知此乃資本主義傳統之劣根性而所以覆滅資本主義於今日也旣知社會爲惡劣矣當判其表　謀根本之改造所謂釜底抽薪瑣屑問題自能同歸於盡何必效彼頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚不經濟而不澈底之方法而遭皮相之譏况乎期之社會主義實行者尤非﹁背私爲公﹂不可良以中國農工解放中華民族復興國際和平實現母許再存絲毫私見於其間也然改造之道多端人類之意見不一無統一之革命理論卽無革命之一致行爲則孰取孰舍彼民衆先鋒之靑年社會領導之輿論實無諉責之餘地輿論倡靑革命之目的固在勞苦羣衆革命之工具却在靑年誤認手段爲目的固不可卽視目的爲手段抑亦非當故重視靑年問題實不亞於勞苦羣衆問題我爲我同儕三致拳拳者卽此意耳</p>
<p>旣知革命理論之重要則取舍之道唯何曰首重研究卽對於一種理論以觀察的眼光加以經騐的分析然後揆諸事實要以時空　間行之俱宜爲尚切不可初具一籠統觀念而驟加藐視或盲從也我嘗讀先生敎言字襄行間頗有追戀社會主義之流露果然資本主義破産我人終當覓一出路社會主義固亦善者第勿以資本主義之進步視之可乎試一溯社會主義之歷史其思想在十七世紀自然科學發達以來有所謂經騐哲學啟蒙哲學所造成之機械世界觀物質人生觀中己有孕育遠言之當資本主義之夢想尚無線索社會主義之理想如孔子大同說柏拉圖共和國穆爾鳥托邦早已具矣社會主義幼稚之實行如摩根所證說之古代社會亦早已見矣更進一步言之際兹資本主義崩潰聲中出路不僅在社會主義一端已也如社會政策法西斯主義及理想的Techoocracy等皆是由此可知社會主義亦不過爲應用人類智識與技術之方向之一種轉換以應付資本主義之支配力量不足以控制社會也馬克思唯物史觀以爲資本主義進化至自然傾覆時期無産階級勢力增大共産社會主義乃得實現但昔之帝俄資本主義固未臻成熟而鮑爾雪維克已建立勞工專政之局面矣豈馬克思之錯誤歟抑如考茨基所稱列寗之勞工專政非馬克思之學說也耶雖然此二者俱證明我支配力量之說矣更有言者我人亦不以是而蔑視馬氏整個學理蓋中國之革命理論需其解釋者有足多也</p>
<p>先生答話中除社會主義之依戀外對蘇聯尚有崇信之表示據我測度尊意以中國出路在社會主義而社會主義之表率則爲蘇聯果然蘇聯之成績與英美德異致然卽因成績驚人之籠統觀念而崇信之又不免流於浮魯我人旣知其然更應知其所以然換言之應推究其偉大成就之原動力何在要之約有下述數端焉</p>
<p>一在組織靑年也蘇俄一九○年人口統計之年齡分配（以每千人中計算）歐洲部分自零歲至十九歲者男佔千分之二四九女佔千分之二六六自二十歲至五十九歲者男佔一六六女佔二四一五十九歲以上者男佔三五女佔四三亞洲部分第一组年齡男佔二五六女佔二六○第二組年齡男佔一九一女佔二一九第三組年齡男佔三七女亦佔三七根據此統計可推知蘇聯人口集中於少年及靑年其支配社會者亦明乎此乃嚴密組織嚴格訓練靑年以期能勝任革命之鉅責如﹁十月人﹂以至少年先鋒隊以至共産主義靑年團而至共産黨皆有其重大之使命</p>
<p>二在特殊專政也通稱蘇聯爲民族平等農工獨裁之國家實則不然列寗的蘇俄已非馬克恩所理想之共産社會斯太林時代之蘇聯更非列寗所締建之蘇俄蓋現今之蘇聯乃以共産黨代農工兵專政而以斯太林代共産黨獨裁此皆　實本無待乎分辯又如蘇聯憲法規定其中執行委員會由民族院及聯盟院組織之聯盟院代表在蘇聯蘇維埃大會中選出民族院則由各自治地方自治共和國另選代表充之凡蘇聯中執委會决議案必須得民族院聯盟院曁中執委會之一致同意方得有效否則開聯席會議調解之此似爲尊重民族自决之信條顧全少數人民之意見也但一旦調解失敗由中執委會提交蘇聯蘇維埃大會作最後之裁决蘇聯蘇維埃大會乃以人口爲比例分配選出代表組織之而蘇俄人口殆佔蘇聯四之三蘇聯蘇維埃大會當以蘇俄勢力爲最大可左右一切於是民族自决者不過蘇俄民族自决而已雖然此種專政實另有使人注意之價值在焉</p>
<p>三在統制經濟也蘇聯努力成績最顯而最炫人者厥此統制經濟之成功若由列寗電氣化計　進展之五年計劃世人早已驚道不已此之爲蘇聯社會主義國家之支配力量之特色信然蓋今日蘇聯之支配力量已移人類進化之智識及技術應用於另一方向卽如先生所言﹁有計劃地有系統地最經濟地最充分地﹂之發展也至其經過若何成績若何諒國人知之審矣無待乎我之贅言</p>
<p>四在廢除私有也資本主義罪惡若剩餘價值之掠奪私人資本之積累皆不過此私有財産制之虎倀耳故欲根本免除社會之不幸非廢止私有制之梏桎不可蘇聯卽爲唯一實行此種政策之國家如工業國營資本國有對外交易亦由國家管理另使農村農塲化如建立國有農塲以爲標準獎勵合作農塲以求實效於是工農都具民族國家之意識自動參加生産且統制生産如各筕生産衝鋒隊之組織實與五年計劃成功一莫大之助力</p>
<p>我述蘇聯之特色畢想及中國今日之出路除特殊數先决問題外諸優點者皆足資我人之採效但不知國人已否注意及之至中國之整個革命理論如何本欲卽此略伸一二管見第覺上文已佔篇幅甚巨下文字數亦幾相埒惟恐妨及大衆通信權利姑待下次就正不知先生高見若何我嘗謂我人不怕錯誤所貴者能自錯誤中求正確我人不怕矛盾所貴者能自矛盾中求和諧如此世間何事而不可解决者哉宇宙在變人生在變君子以自强不息敬此恭祝進步（復信明日發表）</p>

<h3 id="c194">九地篇火 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 雪明</p>
<p>偶然從舊著架上,翻出　封的一册孫子有。恰巧又展開一頁就是九地篇的文章。本來不是武人，何必研究兵書，可是那﹁九地﹂兩字陌生得很就吸引我讀下去，一眼就是··</p>
<p>一用兵之法有散地，有輕地，有爭地，有交地，有衢地，有重地，有圯地，有園地，有死地。諸侯自戰其地爲散地，入人之地而不深者爲輕地，我得則利；彼得亦利者爲爭地，我可以往；彼可以來者爲交地，諸侯之地三屬；先至而得天下之衆者爲衢地，入城之地深背城邑多者爲重地，行山林險阻沮澤凡難行之道者爲圮地，所由人者浚；所從歸者迂，彼寡可以擊我之衆者爲園地，疾戰則存；不疾戰則亡者爲死地······。﹂</p>
<p>據此，試拿中日這一次的戰爭比較看看。</p>
<p>昔之諸侯，各據一方，養兵自護，正與現在的軍閥相彷彿。内戰如奉直之爭，兵出關外，以東三省爲散地，弄得里閭荒墟民生顦顇，奉軍旣勝，倨傲成惰，故有九一八的事變發生。日帝國的鐵蹄踐踏碎了瀋陽，中國軍隊以不抵抗而失掉輕地，那時如果反攻，不難收復失地；但不然，連把吉林黑龍江富庶的區域，都放棄凈盡，軍隊澈退錦州，攻守尚極占優勢。那裏知道以後連錦州檜關這　個名城要塞，在軍事上可以力爭，可以交鋒的地帶，又先後陷落呢？而這時漢奸叛逆又乘機組織傀儡國，强姦民意，坐擁幾千萬人口的土地，衢地旣失，不抵抗將軍剛才覺悟到不抵抗的非策，才後集中鴉片軍於多山林掩蔽的熱河省。你也知道如果要恢復東三省的失土，非死守熱河不可，照孫子說，這已是﹁重地﹂﹁圯地﹂了。不幸得很湯玉麟先生倒底把他送掉了。現在我們的抗日軍正依長城作戰，喜峰口正面突出，左右翼已迫近長城，而敵人以承德爲大本營，利用迂曲仄夾的山徑，進可以攻，退可以守，我們的前鋒，好像頗有被擊破或包圜的危險；如果眞有這種不利情形，陷入圍地，我們只有後退，再放棄長城，那時候我們閉眼一想，是個什麽局面呢！所以現在若不積極反攻，必陷﹁死地。﹂門户大開，用兵之法盡，而華北危！黄河以北，恐怕英雄無用武之地了。與孫子所謂﹁善戰者立於不敗之地﹂，相離未免太遠了吧？有人說：漢將韓信與趙國交征，井徑口一役，背水而戰，呌做﹁陷之死地而後生，置之亡地而後存。﹂那樣說：中國抗日之戰，已無有﹁九地﹂難道就這樣，中國得復興嗎？</p>

<p>— 萍草</p>
<p>身作日本傀儡榮膺僞國執政的溥儀，大名是早已鼎鼎的了，但他實際是怎麽樣人，恐怕不是一般人所能猜到，我旣没有鄭孝胥的資格作漢奸，又没有胡適之的博士頭銜有入宫覲見的榮幸，當然也不十分明瞭，不過我曾拜讀過他的文稿，可以作一點管窺的判斷去年我在北平，兩毛錢換一張故宫遊覽券，恰巧那天開放的是乾淸宫，乾淸宫裏邊的樂壽堂正是溥儀先前的寢室現雖人去樓空，而手澤却依然存在，史論，書札，日記，等小品，件件俱全，雖不似唐李後主的哀艶纏綿，却有蜀劉後主的滑稽可笑，所以當時我就不憚煩地抄錄了數則。</p>
<p>看來溥儀却像一個有志中興的人，他的光武中興論開筆有這樣幾句：﹁天下之人，誰不欲中興哉，但中興豈不難乎，若光武則大謬不然···﹂他也是關心東西文化的人所以他也懂英文，給他夫人的信，上下稱呼都是中西合璧：﹁我的親愛的瓦矣夫······You的Husband溥儀上﹂，他不特懂英文，並且會韻文，請看他的桃花宫詞，﹁桃花宫，桃花院，桃花院裏住了桃花仙桃花臉，桃花面，桃花臉上長了桃花癬﹂，猶其重要的，他羅致的人才，新舊兼收，不特鄭孝胥給他改卷子，就是北大文學院長胡適之也常常延見，所以胡博士的名片，還裝在玻璃框内，上面還寫着﹁今日有事，不能入宫覲見﹂，一行端楷小字，從此可以曉得溥儀是怎麽樣人，知識高到什麽程度，我們對他的行爲，只可憐其愚頑後來竟至甘作傀儡，即是他愚頑的表現。</p>
<h3 id="c197">冷口吟 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>冷口爲今日戰地之重心，但其地古無可考，按一統志，唐時契丹兵敗，阻冷陘以自固，宋時金人流洪皓於冷山，殆卽冷口與？聞前綫有女子，持白刄以餉敵人者，纖纖玉手，閃閃刀光，紅血與白雪紛飛，别具一種燦爛悲壯之奇境，遙望河山此心欲絶，因以賦此；</p>
<p>我聞抗敵以槍不以刀，以刀抗敵敵驚號，有女攘臂虓虎怒，殺聲四起皆英豪，敵當之，敵斷魂，跼天蹐地無處奔，倒地百拜聲欲吞，玉手砍頸刀無痕，霎時刀光如火起，冰天雪地始開霽。兵氣揚，敵氛洗刲敵肝；解敵體；别敵腸；吸敵鼈；敵昨何勇今何靡？乃知倭奴兵力雄，請試我刀而已矣不然敵勢伊何底！</p>
<p>冷口前，誰去戰？砲聲如當，冷口外，敵人擲彈轟不已。冷口結冰花，沙草一片凌朝霞。冷口風如虎，刀光廻雪嚥脂舞。一刀劈去頭毂轆，再劈著地如刖足，那時恨不食其肉，横刀兜來剌其腹，跪拜膝前徒恥辱。宛轉以死無許哭，歛以犬齒衣以血，慘哉四體胥侷縮，吾望戰地快克復，敵人庶幾瞑厥目。冷口四野雪花紅，佗年競說大刀功。</p>

<p>第三回終負解鈴心登門鐺錯暗憐丫角頭推食分</p>
<p>天氣又冷，陰雲黯黯的，半空裏飛着一兩片如有如無的雪花，他伸出來提着那根桶上鐵絲柄的手，都成了紅蘿蔔了。本想把這桶水潑了，已經走了這些路了，若是把水潑了怪可惜的。若是把水提回去，不但自己力量不够，而且這手骼膀伸了出來，也實在凍得難受，正在心裏躊躇着，不知如何是好，却好趙自强手上提了一大串牛肉，由身後走了來。看到他將一桶水歇在路頭上，紅着頸　子，只望了水出神便停了脚問道：大姑娘你提不動吧？桂枝道：可不是？好好兒的挑水夫又罷工了，呌我眞没有辦法。趙自强走上前來，一伸手就把桶柄提到手上，伸直了腰，很快的就提到大門裏面來。桂枝在後面跟着幾乎都跟不上。趙自强提到了門洞子裏，等着桂枝進來，笑向他道：大姑娘，這水倒在那裏？我和你提了去。桂枝便道這：就謝謝了，怎好再要你送呢？趙自强笑道：没關係街裏街坊的，彼此魚帮水，水帮魚。你府上若是没人挑水。没人送煤，這件事交給我了。倘若是我們老爺子的衣服脫了個紐絆兒，鞋子破了鞋帮子，這可說不得了，要請大姑娘費點事。江氏在屋子裏早聽到了，迎了出來道：呵喲！怎樣好讓連長給我們提水呢？趙自强笑道：没關係！連長怎麽着，手也不是僉子打的。人人有兩隻手，這兩隻手都可以作事。他說着話，已經把這一桶水提到屋子來，看到水缸放在門後邊，便提了水桶，轟的一聲將水倒了下去。江氏道：多謝多謝，此後趙連長有什麽事要我們作的，可别客氣，就呌我們作呀！趙自强笑着到裏院去了。趙翁正捧了一本三國演義，在雪窗下靠火看着。見趙自强提了一大串牛肉進來，就笑着站起來道？又買這些個牛肉回來作什麽？昨天買回來的羊肉；我還没有吃完呢（三○）</p>

<p>江南眞是好風景呀你看三月裏的桃花又點綴了錦繡山河引逗着一般人爲了他而沉醉顛倒詩人爲了它而推敲畫家爲了它而寫生旅行家提着鏡箱替它攝影文人舗紙蘸墨替它作傳輕薄桃花竟有如許的魔力</p>
<p>到底人在追求桃花呢？還是桃花在引誘着人？倘使我做了法官，兩造告到我的案下。我一定毫不遲疑的判斷道：﹁桃花的開放，是爲着生命的奮鬥。人類的玩賞，實具覬觎的野心。以後賞玩桃花，一槪禁止﹂。這樣的判决，一些都不武斷，不偏私。因爲保護弱小的民族；抑止强大的野心，非這樣不可。</p>
<p>在此年頭，桃花離豔，醫不好失地之痛：救不得亡國之慘，我們玩它甚麽？我們有賞玩桃花的閒情逸趣，何不到關外去賞玩賞玩兵士的血花，還可激起同仇之愾；振起殺敵之心。東起九門：西迄古北，長城的外面，滿佈了鐵騎他們是有新式的殺人利器，我們是祇有忠勇報國的肉彈。這許多肉彈，提着大刀；赤着上身，在烟霧炎燄中進進進；在槍林彈雨中殺殺殺。敵人果然是望風披靡，我們的肉彈，亦殺身成仁了。結果是漠漠的黄沙地上；皚皚的冰雪山頭，灑了許多因製成的桃花。江南的桃花好呢？長城邊的桃花好呢？請去賞鑒一下我記得從前有兩句詩道：﹁馬後桃花馬前雪，呌人那得不回頭﹂。這種詩太頽唐了！太呌人短氣了！現在我來改他一下：﹁馬後桃花馬前血，桃花那及血花紅﹂。同胞門莫貪戀着江南的桃花，快去賞鑒那關外的血花。</p>

<h3 id="c200">最藝術的國家 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>我們中國的最偉大最永久,而且最普遍的﹁藝術﹂是男人扮女人這藝術的可貴,是在於兩面光，或謂之﹁中庸﹂丨男人看見﹁扮女人﹂女人看見﹁男人扮﹂。表面上是中性，骨子裏當然還是男的。然而如果不扮還成藝術碼譬如說，中國的固有文化是科舉制度，外加捐班之類當初說這太不像民權，不合時代潮流，於是扮成了中華民國。然而這民國年久失修連招牌都已經剥落殆盡，彷彿花旦臉上的脂粉。同時，老實的民衆眞個要起政權來予竟想革掉科甲出身和捐班出身的參政權。這對於民族是不忠對於祖宗是不孝實屬反動之至。現在早已回到恢復固有文化的﹁時代潮流﹂那能放任這種不忠不孝。因此更不能不重新扮過一次，草案如下：第一誰有代表國民的資格須由考試决定第二，考出了舉人之後，再來挑選一次，此之謂選（動詞）舉人；而被挑選的舉人，自然是被選舉人了。照文法而論，這樣的國民大會的選舉人，應稱爲﹁選舉人者﹂而被選舉人，應稱爲﹁被選之舉人﹂。但是，如果不扮還成藝術碼？因此，他們得扮成憲政國家的選舉的人和被選舉的人，雖則實質上還是秀才和舉人。這草案的深意就在這裏：呌民衆看見是民權，而民族祖宗看見是忠孝丨忠於固有科舉的民族，孝於制定科舉的祖宗。此外，像上海已經實現的民權，是納稅的方有權選舉和被選，使偌大上海只剩四千四百六十五個大市民。這雖是捐班丨有錢的爲主，然而他們一定會考中舉人，甚至不補考也會賜同進士出身的，因爲洋大人膝下的榜樣，理應遵照，何况這也是一面並不違背固有文化，一面又扮得很像憲政民權呢？此其一。</p>
<p>其二，一面交涉，一面抵抗：從這一面看過去是抵抗，從那一面看過來其實是交涉。其三，一面做實業家，銀行家，一面自稱﹁小貧而已﹂。其四一面日貨銷路復旺，一面對人說是﹁國貨年﹂······諸如此類不勝枚舉，而大都是扮演得十分巧妙，兩面光滑的。</p>
<p>呵，中國眞是個最藝術的國家，最中庸的民族。</p>
<p>然而小百姓還要不滿意，嗚呼，君子之中庸，小人之反中庸也！</p>
<h3 id="c201">白俄 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>出了門，穿過一條狹暗的小弄走，到霞飛路上，迎面便有一個人，向我脫下帽子來，那是一個白俄。</p>
<p>我認識他，他是在這條路上，幹着類似乞丐的職業的；每天我從這條路上走過，總得看見他他，也總得向我脫下他底帽子。</p>
<p>我不知道他姓甚名誰，正如他不知道我一樣。我不能用俄國話向他問詢，他也不能用中國話向我求乞。我和他，在表面上，是完全隔膜的。</p>
<p>但我們底内心，却儘有着共通的地方。他每次看見我，脫下他底帽子來時，總得向我微笑。這微笑裏含有苦味。從這微笑裏，我能看出他往昔的窮奢極慾和現在的顛沛困頓。</p>
<p>然而我却終於没有佈施過他什麽，這因爲我不知道佈施一個俄國乞丐是否和佈施一個中國乞丐相同：所以有時身邊雖然袋滿了錢，却總遲疑地不敢取出來不知從什麽時候起我忽然動了憐憫他的念頭，那時他正向我微笑着，一手執着脫下來的帽子，一手伸出了拇指和小指，放在口邊。我忽然醒悟了過來，忍不住向他問道：</p>
<p>﹁你是要吸烟嗎？﹂</p>
<p>他似乎聽不懂我底話，下意識地點着頭，仍舊微笑着。我開始把他帶領到一　烟紙店門前，花了一毛錢，買了一包﹁五華牌﹂香烟給他。他接過了，嘴唇皮動了一動兩眼呆木地注視着我，眼睛裏充滿了謝意。</p>
<p>這以後，就成了定例。每天他看見我時，總得把拇指和小指放在口邊；我也總得破費一毛錢，買一包﹁五華牌﹂香烟給他。</p>
<p>可是我底經濟力畢竟有限，日子一天天的過去，我竟連這每天一毛錢的一包﹁五華牌﹂香烟的供給都有些負擔不起了丨今天，我又在霞飛路上遇見了他，這一個異國的友人，（我情願稱他做友人，不情願有一個紳士式的朋友。）仍舊微笑着，脫下他底帽子，把拇指和小指放在口邊；但我却終於横着心，向他拍了拍我底衣袋，表示我已没有繼續供給他的力量了。他底臉色忽然沮喪了下來，便把那隻原來放在口邊的手搖了兩搖，默不作聲的凄然地走了開去。</p>
<p>我望着他底背影一切弱者底卑微的生活和可憐的境遇都憧愷上了我底心頭，使我底靈魂負了傷一樣的作痛。我覺得，就是他那隻搖着的手上，也帶得有他底善良的靈魂和善良的心。我懺悔，但他已去得遠了。</p>
<p>忽然一個疑問衝進了我底腦裏：﹁生活在目前這種國家環境裏的我，在强者底眼裏看來，究竟和他有幾多差别呢？﹂</p>
<p>迎面走過來一個賣報童子，高聲的向我喊出了熱河失守的消息。</p>

<p>在全世界厲行一夫一妻制的現代，西藏至今還盛行着一妻多夫制。這不合理的婚姻制度所以遺留至今，當然也自有其原因綜括一般人的說法，西藏一妻多夫制盛行的原因，大約有二種，有些人說，西藏人口，女的少於男的，因爲不夠分配，所以只好採行這種制度。其實，西藏旣没有户籍調查，又没有人口統計，怎能說得出男的或女的多些少些呢？這一點，大槪是些旅行者們，或歐美各處的社會學家們的一種臆測之辭。還有些人說，西藏盛行一妻多夫制的原因，是在於經濟關係上。因爲該地資源貧乏，生産艱難，積蓄資財，頗不易易，富貴的人家，爲保守祖業，不得不力謀團聚，故有兄弟五六人者，常合娶一妻，反之，貧窮的人家，却反能人娶一妻。這種說法，比前者似乎稍合事實。</p>
<p>西藏的婦女，可分兩部分來講，一是城市的婦女，二是鄉間的婦女。鄉間婦女的主要勞作，是耕種，牧蓄，採柴，運搬貨物，她們不搽粉，不妝飾，成日埋頭苦幹，雄壯而醜陋，皮膚呈棕黑色，但極樸實。城市婦女便大不相同了。我們舉西藏首府羅薩城的情形爲例吧。羅薩的婦女，可分四個階級：第一，是貴族婦女。她們有漂亮的容貌，與風采　　　有緻丨　舞蹈喜蹶　也很活潑，首飾類皆金玉珊瑚珠寶製成，妝扮最爲富麗。第二，是中流的婦女。她們經營小商營，開設小店舗，販賣綢緞，布帛，雜物之類。她們當做買賣時，善於說虚價，且間以温情迷醉買客，便於以善價出售其貨物。第三，是下等婦女。西藏有操皮肉生涯的私娼，但没有公開的妓院。有些小家碧玉，因爲嫁期已近，而妝奩之資尚無着落，便不惜出賣其肉體，易錢以辦妝奩者，這眞是一種奇怪風俗，第四是女尼。羅薩一般的家庭，若生女子二人以上者，必選一人，剃度爲尼，遣之庵中苦修一生，而女子之爲尼者，似亦頗爲甘願。</p>
<h3 id="c203">﹁子夜﹂和國貨年 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 樂雯</p>
<p>據說，今年是國貨年。但是，今年出現了茅盾的﹁子夜﹂</p>
<p>﹁子夜﹂里的國貨大王丨或者企圖做國貨大王的吳蓀甫，﹁他有發展民族工業的偉大志願他向來反對擁有大資本的杜竹齋之類專做地皮，金子，公債；然而他自己現在却也鑽在公債裏了！﹂固然，國貨可以﹁救國﹂，公債聽說也可以﹁救國，﹂丨然而這救國是怎麽樣的救法呢？譬如說，﹁子夜﹂裏的公債大王丨銀錢業大王老趙就比他利害。問題原很簡單：救國必先齊家，齊家必先修身。這種治國平天下的順序孔夫子就已經說過的了。對於這些種種﹁大王，﹂首先要有利潤直接的間接的剥削剩餘價值，作爲他們﹁修身﹂之用。誰善於﹁修身，﹂誰就有資格﹁救國３﹂公債等等有這樣功效，自然要鑽在公債裏去這　然不在於志　　大與否。於是國貨就倒　了﹂　是名目上華洋合　的事業，中國股東骨子裏老老實實都是掮客！老趙就利害煞，　究只是掮客。﹂其實何止華洋合辫的企業呢？就是名目上完全蘭商的工廠，背地廟的主人也會是洋資本家的例如﹁子夜﹂裏的周仲偉丨火柴廠﹁老　。﹂（今年是更新鮮了，有些華商工廠事實上變成了日貨的改裝打包工廠长）國貨旣然倒霉，國貨大王吳蓀甫就只有投降的出路，而且他覺得這﹁投降的出路，總比没有出路好得多罷！﹂</p>
<p>好，投降是决定的了。可是就投降老趙丨那個﹁同美國人打公司的﹂老趙嗎？老趙﹁勾結了洋商，來做中國廠家的抵押欵，那他不過是一名掮客罷了；我們有廠出頂，難道不會自己去找原户頭，何必借重他這位掮客！﹂這所謂原户頭丨﹁假想中的主顧有兩個：英商某洋行，日商某會社﹂這就不止一個簡單的投降問題了。受降的主顧好麽多，又都是世界上的頭等惡覇，豈有不互相打得頭破血淋的道理。不過這些惡覇也還不笨，他們各有各的小狗，先呌小狗之間互相打幾塲，借此看看風頭，比比力量。他們自己直接開火的時候暫時還没有到，却先讓中國來做﹁狗﹂的戰塲。形勢自然十分的複雜，中國的﹁人﹂當然吃盡了苦頭。</p>
<p>中國的這些﹁人，﹂在﹁子夜﹂裏，大半還在﹁狗﹂的愚弄，欺騙，壓迫之下，然而他們己經在戰鬥，在反抗他們的弱點不在於自己不要反抗，而大半還在不善於跳出﹁狗﹂的一切種種陰謀的圈套，以及一切種種間接的，或者間接而又間接的狗意議的影響。例如明明還只是子夜而居然以爲天已經大亮了，甚至於太陽又要落山了，於是拼命的趕路，唯恐怕夜再來之後，就永久不見天日了。這當然不是個個﹁人﹂都這麽想。這只是衝在大衆前面的一些﹁人。﹂大衆正在實踐裏學習着。</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>又過了一刻多鐘，出席的人們都走了一大半了李一香又還哈哈地大笑着，向陳華民挑戰般地提出許多難問題來辯駁。這趟，海泉看見心裏有點不過意了。他想，陳華民的態度固然是獨斷了一點，但這是負責的表現。並且他没有半點不自然的態度。他的志向只是在努力爲革命工作大公無私。李一香似乎是對他的專擅抱了些醋意。</p>
<p>﹁走吧。············﹂</p>
<p>李一香挺着胸，擺動了一下他的身軀，走到海泉面前，拉了他的手，向外就走</p>
<p>﹁老陳，你眞是野野烏！路線弄錯了！﹂</p>
<p>李一香一面走一面說他那種傲然的態度好像是在向陳華民說﹁你看我有這許多羣衆﹂海泉看了看陳華民，只是在傻笑，一聲不響。</p>
<p>海泉跟在一香後面走出那家洋房的門首來了。一香停了步，他立住了脚。</p>
<p>﹁這一家是怎樣的地方？﹂</p>
<p>海泉禁不住先問了一香。</p>
<p>﹁白俄開的小旅館。﹂</p>
<p>海泉聽見後，又覺得一香到底比華民和耀星痛快不會像他們那樣鬼鬼崇崇的無庸秘密的也故意秘密起來。</p>
<p>﹁陳先生何以還不走？﹂</p>
<p>一香聽見海泉這樣問，他先笑了起來，笑了一忽後才說：</p>
<p>﹁他和阿唐恐怕今晚上要睡在這家裏了。裏面有這個。﹂</p>
<p>一香說着伸出一根小指頭來給海泉看。海泉就會意了，點了點頭。他怱然又聽見有人在打呵欠。向那頭望去，在斜對過的牆下，仍然是立着一個巡捕。</p>
<p>﹁怎麽巡捕對於我們一點不注意？﹂</p>
<p>﹁他只當我們是嫖客喲。﹂</p>
<p>﹁但是，人數太多了他不懷疑麽？﹂</p>
<p>﹁不算多的。這是很平常的事。白俄女子有零售的，不一定要整夜。哈，哈。﹂</p>
<p>他倆在薄暗中走了幾步脚。</p>
<p>﹁密司脫林你想會Ｓ社的重要份子麽？﹂</p>
<p>﹁······························﹂</p>

<h3 id="c256">英國供給日本軍火的數量 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>倫敦通信（三月一日）</p>
<p>日内瓦英國代表在表决李頓報告書時表示擁護報告書以圖引起一種印象好像英國不贊同日本遠東行動似的其實英國政府同時就是日本軍火的供給者英國外交部長西門在日内瓦演和平仲裁的角色贊成肯定日本是進攻者的提議在倫敦則以西門爲主要股東的大毒氣公司在增加股東的紅利口頭上擁護和平實際上則擁護戰爭這就是英國的外交部長</p>
<p>要指出英國運到日本去的軍火之確實數目是不可能的英國官廳的貿易統計只記載着關於特許輸出的軍需材料的數字一九二九年日本軍火之總輸入英國佔百分之一七·三至一九三○年英國佔的成數則達百分三○·五嗣後這種成數更有顯著的提高英國運往日本的軍火比運往中國的軍火爲四與一之比於此亦可見英國袒護日本的事實了英國官廳貿易統計指出一九三一年八月至一九三二年九月運往日本的機關槍和子彈的數量特别多自一九三一年九月至一九三二年九月公開運往日本的子彈約計一千萬發機關槍約計六百六丨架此外還有非常多的其他軍器一九三二年總計運往日本的子彈一千三百萬發機關槍八百架但這不過是日本總參謀部听定購的軍火之第批貨而已英國軍需工業曾經隨着日本遠東軍事之發展而更形猛進無日無夜地在加工製造最近四個月中單就供給機關槍一項而言已足以供五十四旅之用了（同時有幾百萬的子彈和附屬機件等等運往日本）</p>
<p>據“DailyHerald；消息某一兵工廠曾單獨供給日本子彈三千六百萬發另一兵工廠曾供給日本機關槍一千架這是八個星期内的事維克爾亞姆斯特倫公司以前戰前的股利只有百分之五現在股利竟增至百分二十五新近又得到購軍火的合同爲數值三千萬金鎊該公司不久以前曾有大批的大砲運往日本現在又繼續得到定購大批八磅半重的炸彈的合同了﹁星期快報﹂消息維克爾亞姆斯特倫每日二十四小時都在爲日本製造以來爲製造炸彈帽曾加用工人七百名紐卡斯特爾廠去年十一月曾以三十架唐克車運往日本維克爾亞姆斯特倫康塞恩之達特福特廠完全是替日本製造手溜彈的</p>
<p>最後值得特别注意的是日本在英國收買船隻在最近三年間日本計在英國購去舊船七十六艘共　噸數五十萬噸其中大部分都是去年下半年成交的有兩艘比較很大共自吃水最四萬五千噸大戰時這些英國船都是作運輪船病院船和武裝貿易船用的日本同時也在荷蘭挪威和比利時購買船隻</p>
<p>上面已經說過英國運往日本的軍火在英國貿易统計上是得不到正確的數目的英國軍需工廠對於私售軍火有她私售的方法﹁星期快報﹂宣稱英國供給日本政府的軍火很多是經　暹羅的外一大部分前綫上用的軍火都是不經過日本海口直接運往一定的地點的</p>
<p>英國工業供給日本的軍火其數目之大已達到不復能夠秘密的程度了</p>
<h3 id="c257">日本戰爭總動員之準備（日本通信） <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>最近此間科學畫報社舉行國家總動員座談會出席者均爲陸軍部人物如整備局統制課長上月良夫·課員八里知道·整備局動員課山田淸一·新聞班谷萩那華雄等所論極爲重要兹摘要譯述讀之當可明瞭日本最近準備戰爭之一斑矣</p>
<p>一未來戰爭的形容總動員</p>
<p>將來的戰爭到底要變成怎樣的形態不用說我們都知道一切的東西都是進化的戰爭也是從古代到現在非常進化過來的在原始時代的戰爭戰爭的主體大槪以一人爲中心或以一族黨爲中心然而因社會逐漸進化戰爭的主體也漸擴大到民族·部落·都市·或國家又古代的戰爭祗限於國民一部分尤其是少數人主張用武力來作戰所以戰爭的終局都是歸諸中心人物的倒敗或一族黨的滅亡或部落都市·國家武裝團體的敗亡但是自普法戰爭一八七○丨一八七三年以來特别表現着進化的狀態即法國軍幾乎完全被德國軍所破滅了野戰軍雖然都被潰滅但是甘别太在以後所集合的義勇軍的兵力據說有二百五十萬這就是表現着在這個時代野戰軍雖被破滅但是如果國民仍具有繼戰爭的强大意志時尚可國家而戰其後雖然也發生了淸日戰爭和日俄戰爭但是這並不算是徹頭徹尾的打戰可以說是戰到中途而告終的所以没有表現了所謂國民戰的形態如果在那時候日本打敗了必定再集義勇軍來繼續作國民的决戰至於世界大戰更不用說幾乎全歐洲都參加了戰爭的狀態其進化的足跡有歷史可以作證就是在原始時代戰爭是一人對一人的狀態但是因社會的進化戰爭也逐漸變成種種的形態如普法戰爭可以說是全國民之戰而世界大戰可以說是國力之戰如果將來再有戰爭的話我以爲這個未來戰和世界全部的政治·經濟·交通·運輸有非常密接的關係所以戰爭的發生與其說是　淸日戰爭和日俄戰爭那樣國對一國的軍戰狀態不如說是數國對數國或一國對數國的複戰狀態由此看來在未來之戰兩</p>
<p>所用的兵數應該要比較過去的戰役增加的因此軍需品也應該需要更多的並且前面也說過的交戰的方法也大爲變化終於變成了所謂國力之戰所以當兩國作戰的時候把敵國國民的繼戰意志打消這也是算入在戰法之中那麽如果要把敵國國民的繼戰意志打消應該用甚麽方法呢那是有許多的方法的舉一二例來說就是由宣傳來打消軍隊或國民的戰勝信念這也是個方法並且　前飛機很發達從遠處甲飛機運一噸炸彈向政治中心的東京或經濟工業中心的名古屋·或北九州方面擲炸這又是一種方法或仍用飛機擲炸工業都市以計畫破壞其資源這種計畫破壞資源的事也是種交戰的方法其他如德國對英國所採取的飢餓政策或經濟封鎖的手段也應該算做一種重要的交戰手段最近某國（指蘇聯）竟發出將來的戰爭無戰線的言論實際上當打戰的時候要用子彈來對陣所以没有戰線的戰爭是没有的但是某國的交戰手段却是這樣的一方面在第一綫作戰同時擴大戰綫自第一綫的後方以至於殖民地敵國國内用種種的方法消滅其武力或引導其革命誠然某國採用這樣的交戰手段也許是可能的從這樣看來將來的戰爭已經不是綫的也不是平面的而是立體的而地域方面又由戰塲而擴至國内關於軍隊　裝備方面在世界大戰時德國使用毒瓦斯由暗中攻擊使英軍大敗反之英國又利用坦克車攻入德國軍内使德境懸危如是兵器由戰爭而作非常的進步今後新的兵器勢必應時而産生的並且這些兵器都要使用大最的鐵的到了最近使用大量毒瓦斯材料的傾向也很顯明的表現出來了我們來看看各國所努力的兵器就明白其所看重的就是航空機的充實化學兵機的發達和鎗砲威力的增加因爲要補救這些對於光學的·電的·　密機械的智識兵器都盡其研究的能事並且以各種汽車來代替馬匹的機械化兵團自數年前就發現於各國如是觀察將來戰爭的形勢無論從那方面看來都需要大量的鐵都需要大量的軍需品這是很顯明的日俄戰爭兩年間日本軍所發射的砲彈爲百五萬發在藩陽一役兩週間日本軍發射了三十三萬發然而在世界戰爭的馬爾乃一役一週間法國軍發射了百萬發即日俄戰爭二年間日本所使用的砲彈法國軍祗在一週間就發射得乾乾凈凈了又在蘇力姆一役二週間法國單用了二千萬發而英國軍用了千四百萬發如是把這許多的鐵量落在敵陣地單就這些砲彈來設想到底這些工業在戰時應該要在何處製造這種疑間勢必立即發生的在日本的陸軍不過祗有造兵械廠而已在這裏當然造不出多量的東西出來所以終非利用民間的工廠不可的這祗單就子彈來說的但是被服·糧　·也應需要莫大的數量的其他如衛生材料·獸醫材料·也需要相當的數量把這些東西在官設的工廠製造終究是不可能的一時要把能力擴大的事在短時期内是辦不到的因此勢必須使用民間的工廠其他關於原料究竟要怎樣採取並且製品如果造好了又應該用何方法積貯於何處要把這些怎樣輪送其他要想起來必定更有種種的問題發生的這些問題應該在平時解决的到了戰事爆發纔來準備那是勢所不能的所以要從平時準備的作這種準備的計畫我們呌做軍需工業動員</p>

<h3 id="c275">女子解放與男子解放 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 雉</p>
<p>中國的婦女解放運動，到現在至少已有了二十餘年的歷史。這運動發展的結果，使一部分婦女在政治上和社會上得佔有相當的地位；這確是一件可喜的事！</p>
<p>那末，她們眞的已解放了嗎？没有！完全没有丨連男子都還没有得着解放，更何論婦女丨她們所有的解放，除了剪髮，放足，以及纖纖的手裏多了幾隻飯碗，或政治舞臺上産生了幾個女委員女縣長以外，簡直什麽都没有！</p>
<p>自從資本帝國主義的勢力很快的衝進了東方的門户，世界經濟恐慌的浪潮越過了東海，淹没了東亞大陸以來，那血汗被榨取盡了的次殖民地的中國，其四肢百體更是充滿了千孔百瘡；城市的没落，農村的破産，無一不呈現着殘敗的現象。在這種情况之下，於是那些﹁半解放﹂的中國婦女便到處碰壁了。的確，他們是已經解放了，大大的解放了，你看，她們有許多人在經濟上是已經能夠獨立了。然而，大多數的她們和大多數的男子一樣，有的雖有了職業，却仍不夠維持生活，而失業的恐怖還要不時的威脅她們；有的受着生活的驅使，被逼地過着出賣靈魂肉體及勞動力的非人生活。她們和男子們走入了同樣的命運，帶着同樣的鐐銬，她們和男子們同樣的没有獲得解放！她們没有麵包和自由，只有痛苦，壓迫，飢餓和死亡！</p>
<p>那一個桎梏只解脫了一小部分，但另一個的桎梏却又帶上了！</p>
<p>有些站在社會上層建築的特殊階級的婦女，她們却還要翻過來壓迫她們勞苦的姊妹們和兄弟們。她們把自己的鐐銬毁去了，却又把那些更粗大更沉重的鐐銬給别人鎖上。</p>
<p>總之，現時代的婦女解放運動早已不是男女兩性間的對抗運動，而乃是被壓迫的男女聯合起來與資本帝國主義者以及其他壓迫者間的對抗運動。所以，眞正的婦女解放運動應該從﹁民族解放運動﹂做起，應該從﹁整個的社會運動﹂做起。要知道婦女問題只是整個的社會問題的一環；等整個的社會問題解决了，婦女問題纔能得到澈底的完滿的解决。換一句話說，眞正的女子解放就是男子解放，也就是﹁人﹂的解放！</p>

<p>— 逸玲女士</p>
<p>中學校中練習生</p>
<p>我和我的姊姊從前在閘北乂乂路乂乂女校當過練習生。我們本來想在這個學校裏當幼稚生的小敎員，一面自己讀點書的已對於練習生這個名稱·我們起初就覺得有點古怪·學校並不是洋行，或商店，怎麽會有練習生？後來經介紹我們的人說，這個學校的幼稚生敎員大都是由練習生升上的，凡初來的人須先在幼稚園裏學習管理小孩，這樣要過了三個月或半年之後纔得升爲敎員</p>
<p>但是進來一星期之後，我們的願望便消滅了。我們發見這兒的剥削手段比較工廠的合理化制度還要厲害。在進校的第二天，那矮小的戴眼鏡的女校長便把我們調到庶務室去了。她說：﹁對不起，幼稚園那裏人太多了，請暫到庶務室學習吧丨一有空位，就會把你們揷入的。﹂</p>
<p>我們在庶務室裏，並没有什麽東西可學，只是整天的做着記錄工作。凡有學生來取一本書，或習字簿，就記錄下來。這種工作從早晨八時做起，直要到晚上七時纔止。早晨八時以前，我們要到廚房把小菜分派給寄宿生。每位學生只許分一湯匙油炸黄豆或花生和一小塊的腐乳（七個銅板一塊的紅腐乳要切成八塊丨）晚上還要管理宿舍裏的學生。在星期日或假日我們和一部份的小學敎員是没有權利回家的。我們只許每月回家二次，但晚上九時以前就得回校。</p>
<p>我們的校長陳乂乂女士是個繙譯家，曾經譯過幾本英文的偵探小說。也是個愛國家，爲了她那在日本留學的哥哥娶了日婦爲室，曾經對他流涙過，曾經對着數百個小學生很憤慨的駡過他。而尤其是個經濟家，她除聘請了一兩個薪水在三十元以下的初中敎員以外，其餘幼稚園和小學部敎員都是些薪水還不滿二十元的貧苦寡婦和没有能力升學的立志不嫁的女子她每年收入總計有數萬元之鉅，但她却還要說經費不夠，常向校外去募捐。</p>
<p>至於我們練習生的薪水，每月只有兩元！我和我的姊姊終日坐在庶務室裏，一刻鐘也不能離開。假如我們坐着没有事做，給校長看見了，她會呌你抄講義，或縫校服，總之，她會找點任何事給你做。有一次夜裏，我們在看書，她見了馬上拿一罐白漆來呌我們去漆浴室的玻璃窗。同去的李小姐氣得自怨自艾的哭起來了，我却恨得把刷子丢到厠所裏去。</p>
<p>幼稚園的練習生也和我們一樣的吃苦。名義上她們每星期可以上一點鐘的兒童心理學的功課，可是她們没有時間來温習。因爲倘若校長看見了誰在讀書，她就說：﹁這樣不成的，祇讀自已的殘酷的社會</p>
<p>書，校裏面的事便没有人做了！﹂</p>
<p>在這樣情形之下，我的姊姊一看這不是路道，在第一個星期裏就走了！但我却挨到冬天才走</p>

<p>兩點鐘還没有敲，母親又在習慣的說，﹁巧珍，怎麽還不上公司去：過一歇開了塲又得聽頭老的嚕囌···﹂﹁知道了。···天天是這麽逼着人家走！﹂我也好像成了習慣，每天都是如此的拿一句刻毒的話問答母親，跑出弄口就坐上事子·</p>

<h3 id="c278">流氓少爺 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 潘女士</p>
<p>（大學校女職員）</p>
<p>我是某大學註册處的女職員。有些人必以爲我旣然在敎育機關裏做事情，所與接處的，都是受過十年以上敎育的人，生活一定是很滿意的了；即使對薪水及待遇方面有所不滿，也不至於有被侮辱的危險。然而不然·</p>
<p>那許多專以靈魂出賣爲事的有錢的大學生，除在舞塲及女生宿舍找顧客外·還注意及於我。我管的是大學生缺席次數的紀錄。因該校無故缺席十次便扣一學分，那些靈魂出賣者因爲屢次無故缺席，所以也就常常和我糾纏。有時說我記他們缺席次數太多了，累他們學分被扣，平白地把我駡了一頓。其實這是不能怪我的，因爲這是我的職務丨</p>
<p>有時，他們故意地站在我的桌前，注目而視。問他們幹什麽。他們又不答，只是胡言亂語，指桑說槐，評頭品足，說個不休！這些流氓少爺顯然是因爲近來玩舞女有些玩厭了，而女同學們又不踩他們。所以如此！流氓少爺們丨我老實告訴你們罷丨我因爲窮·所以出來做事，假如我肯作資産階級男子的玩弄品，我豈肯留此？</p>
<p>有時，有些外省學生·用方言向我說話，我用英文反問他們，則又不答，視我而笑。直至後來那些懂得他們的話的女學生向我說，他們是問我喜不喜歡他們，那時我才明白。從此一聽到他們這樣的問，我就用國語這樣的回答：﹁我很喜歡你們丨丨死呢丨﹂他們知道我聽得懂，以後也就不說了！</p>
<p>但對於那些靈魂出賣者的胡言亂語·我實在想不出妥善對付的方法來！</p>
<p>一直拖到公司。</p>
<p>五點鐘敲過了，大家都趕忙的換班吃飯，好準備招待吃了夜飯逛游戲塲吃茶的客人；不然，那班洋行小鬼一窩蜂似的來了，　喝得你的頭暈腦脹，簡直呌你有八隻手都難以應付。</p>
<p>事件是在一個星期六的晚上開始了。這天京戲塲裏新排了一本﹁文武香球﹂，看客特别的擁擠；一千多個位子都塡滿了客人，還有不少的站班似的立在兩邊甬道上，穿了制服的監　員在那裏拼命的趕都趕不開。所謂洋行小鬼，便佔滿了幾張檯子；我名下的一張檯子在平常很少有人光顧，今天不知道有甚麽新的東西給他們發現了，大家都趨之若驚的往，我這邊跑來。﹁八隻手都難應付﹂，這句話又從我跟前掠過，這情形倒反使我有些着急起來了。</p>
<p>﹁喂！泡幾杯茶來。﹂一個年紀很輕的男子，兩眼露着鼠光，不住的在我臉上溜着說。</p>
<p>﹁幾杯，紅個，淡個？﹂我没好氣的問。</p>
<p>﹁隨便。﹂一個戴着瓜皮小帽子，袖子捲得很高的男子答應着。</p>
<p>﹁要不是吃了這碗撈什子飯，誰願意和這班臭男人胡纏不淸的鬼混。﹂我想着，一面跑去拿茶。</p>
<p>﹁六杯夠麽？﹂把茶朝檯子當中一放，我說。</p>
<p>﹁啊噝！本事倒不錯；一隻手拿了這許多杯子，還要拿毛巾······﹂兩隻老鼠眼睛釘得更緊了，彷彿要把我一口吞下去，他才快意。</p>
<p>﹁怎麽，都泡淡的？我是吃紅的···﹂戴瓜皮帽的連忙揷嘴說。</p>
<p>﹁我要吃菊花的········喂！小王，問她調，炎茶有什麽吃頭！﹂半天都没開口的大塊頭，現在也調起皮來了。丨﹁是你說隨便，我也不是你們肚子裏的蛔蟲：　麽知道你們誰個歡喜吃什麽？﹂眼睛氣得出火了·嘴裏總還說不出更刻毒的話來駡他們：但自己覺得這機的態度·也夠使他們受的了。</p>

<p>我拿毛巾收齊走了，耳神經却溜在那裏聽得他們說：﹁嘿丨小王，你今晚請客該不寃吧？······這隻﹁寡老﹂比初來時要漂亮交關，你看·今晚上衣裳也是新的······﹂</p>
<p>啊！怪不得今晚承他們的情，都來照顧我的生意：原來還是我這件新衣服的帮忙，我手裏端着兩杯茶，邊走邊這麽想。</p>
<p>﹁怎麽專泡兩杯茶，開水就不帶來？我這裏幾杯老早吃乾了。﹂小瓜皮帽子又想出花樣來了。</p>
<p>剛纔泡茶去的時候，還見那麽滿滿的幾杯放在那裏，怎麽轉一轉身就没有了？明曉得是他們想出來的花樣，好使我不能離開這裏，但是賣的是茶，總不能制止他們不喝吧？﹁慢慢的來，我也没生出四隻手來！﹂心裏老是不高興他們的行動</p>
<p>﹁喂丨今晚怎麽這麽漂亮，﹁夜廂﹂生意好不？······幾歲？······﹂他們先自在那裏說着，看見我來了老鼠眼睛忙掉轉頭來，在我身上打量了一番才這麽的問。</p>
<p>﹁什麽？先生，說話干凈點；此地是吃茶的地方，不是······﹂我見他們越說越不像話，連忙扳起臉孔來堵住他們再說下去。</p>
<p>﹁問問你夜裏的茶生意好不，也不要緊·扳什麽臉孔！我花了錢來吃茶，還要受你的氣······﹂老鼠眼睛漲紅了臉，憤憤的站起來說·似乎是不屑吃我的茶的樣子。</p>
<p>﹁去去，不要吃；甚麽天仙化人尋不着，有銅錢還愁没人抬待？﹂那個大塊頭搶着說。</p>
<p>﹁幾多錢？找來！﹂兩塊錢朝檯子上一擲，﹁嘡﹂的一聲，滾了一塊下去。認輸的當然是我，馬上替他拾了起來；他們一窩蜂似的擁在我的後面，跟着到櫃上去拿找頭。</p>
<p>不好了！等我回頭來收杯子時，那五只杯子忽的不見了。問問别的小姊妹都說没有拿，不用說，不是剛才那幾個搗蛋鬼，還有誰？我明白了是我不會逢迎他們；但我還不明白我的職業，對於客人要逢迎到怎樣過程？</p>

<p>— 小朋友</p>
<p>訂書女工</p>
<p>姊姊新近找到職業了，是乂乂書局裏的訂書工作。工資是六塊大洋一月，不供膳宿。她是很懂得的：六塊錢一月，固然買酒不醉，吃飯不飽，住亭子間不夠，可是比較一無收入，鎭日價裏在年老父親面前看白眼，實在要舒服得多。所以她咬緊着牙關進廠去了。</p>
<p>唉！自從姊夫死後，她搬到我家裏來住以來，看她臉色慘白，雙眉緊鎖，從來没有放過一絲笑容。對於身上穿著吃食茶飯，都懶洋洋的非常隨便。父親到了看不過去，常常這樣的駡她：﹁遺累，討債的東西······賠錢貨丨﹂</p>
<p>她聽到了，一聲不響，只是眉頭愈加皺得利害。</p>
<p>如今她不同了。早上起來，頭髮梳得很光滑油漬的布衫也藏了起來，臉上似乎露出快活的神氣，因爲聽說三個月後，生活能夠獨立。</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>﹁大家聽好！公司裏上午發來了一個通告，說；﹁東洋人把熱河奪去了！國難期間，實行﹁航空救國﹂，這半月内每人都要繳﹁航空捐﹂二元。﹂﹂一個工頭模樣的手裏展着一張字條，對女工大衆說。</p>
<p>﹁不承認！不承認！捐也不是捐這許多！我們總共也只有八塊大洋一月，呌我們怎樣過日子呢？﹂四五十個女工亂七八嘈地喊了一陣。</p>
<p>﹁承認也好，不承認也好，這是老板的命令﹂。</p>
<p>﹁有這種道理嗎？······王先生！</p>
<p>﹁這，這，這不是·········﹂</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>時光半個月過去了，女工們的工錢都發了來，大家没有什麽聲響。只在馬路上聽得她們竊私語的聲音······</p>
<p>﹁他媽的！救國？救國？救到洋鬼子的懷裏去了！救到他媽媽的荷包裏去了！救國是這樣救法的嗎？﹂</p>
<p>姊姊回到家裏，把領來的一塊大洋在檯子上一丢，唉聲歎氣地說；﹁這是半個月的工錢！﹂看她臉上，和半個月前一樣的慘白了！</p>

<p>— 朱永麗女士</p>
<p>女童工</p>
<p>我是一個十四歲的女孩子，我從鄉下來了幾個月，就碰着上海打仗。那時我家住在江灣，在鄉下逃難逃了幾個月，最後逃到上海。我的父親也没有事做了，一家人只等着餓肚子。恰好遇着我們同鄉的一個女人，她在楊樹浦路恒豐紗廠做工，我的父親就請她把我帶進去。我學了一個月，學會了，可以接得九十個頭（抵得成年工的一半），但没有工錢，據說係存工。又做了一個月，仍没有工錢。直等到第三個月，才拿着一塊錢，但是每天點心錢要一百文，一月就要三千文，就那時的洋價說·一塊錢還不夠呢。在廠裏如果一點不如法，就要被拿麽温　，我不願意去做，在家裏又要被父親打，自然，我的父親也是爲了一家人的生活不能不忍心打他的女兒啊！每天早上五時起來，晚上六時放工，到家的時候，已經有七點鐘了，因爲我住的地方離廠很遠。起初我不曉得路，還要我的父親天天接來送去。我的母親半夜時候起來，替我燒飯，因爲那時天氣很熱，隔夜的飯往往發酵，第二天就不能吃了。因此一家人都爲我做工而忙得非常厲害。我做到第四個月，還只拿一塊錢，這時我的身體一天一天瘦弱下來了，我從前讀的書也有很多不能記憶了，於是我就向父親要求不肯做工了。我父親只好苦着臉說：﹁好，就不做了吧！﹂我在家頓了幾天，跑到廠裏拿存工，我向一位胖子先生說：﹁我要冋鄉下去了，請把存工算給我。﹂誰知他冷笑了一聲說：﹁做了幾個月那裏可以拿存工﹂，唉！我就這樣埀頭喪氣的跑回家了。但是我一回想這四個月的生活·簡直比牛馬都不如，尤其是做夜工，你一刻也不能躱懶，連上馬桶間都有一定的時間。假如你因了過疲的緣故，在馬桶間不知不覺睡着了，拿麽温跑來見了你，不是打，就是駡你做猪玀。我從前見着農村的農民，以爲是最苦不過的，然而現在一看到城市的工人，比農民還要苦百倍呵！我現在是離開那個地獄了，而從前和我一道做的，年紀和我相彷彿的姊妹們，仍是天天拖着她們瘦黄的身體在那個地獄裏進進出出。</p>
<p>現在，我是失業了，可是我仍想找一些比較好的事情做做，來帮我父親的忙。我具有高小畢業的程度。如公司商號以及其他機關有女練習生一類的工作我都願意做。至於薪水，也多寡不計；我想，讀本刊的先生們總不至於會欺侮我這個可憐的女孩子的。通信處請由本刊轉。</p>

Our Division Commander Yao Dongfan personally supervised the battle at a certain location. Fighting broke out on the east bank of the Shi River at 4:00 PM. More than ten enemy aircraft flew to bomb Shimen Village, Shihetao, Liangjiashan and other places. Frontal infantry and cavalry also jointly launched a fierce attack.

<p>(Luanzhou) Haiyang telephone report: At about 10:00 AM on the 1st, the enemy on the Shimen Village front began a combined infantry, artillery, and air force assault, fiercely attacking our [ ] [ ] positions. We are currently responding calmly. At the same time, at Shuizhaiyu near the right side of Shimen, there were also more than a thousand enemies who infiltrated through Pantao Yu via Yashui River, attempting to attack our connection line to Haiyang Town. The [ ] Battalion of the Nanlinzi reserve team has rushed to meet them in battle, and is currently engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Enemy aircraft dropped bombs on Haiyang Town, and residents fled in droves, causing chaos in the city. Telecommunications to Qinhuangdao have been disrupted.

One company each on the left and right flanks advanced smoothly. The advance on the frontal narrow road was slower, encountering heavy enemy firepower. Both left and right flanks were suppressed and did not succeed, so they retreated back to the Liangjiashan position to await an opportunity for a counterattack. At about 8:00 AM on the 1st, more than ten enemy aircraft in formation bombed the Shimen Village line of positions. Our troops stood firm. At the same time, three enemy aircraft also came to Haiyang Town and circled menacingly over our forward command headquarters. At the unloading port of Qinhuangdao, enemy naval landing forces also appeared to be landing, controlling our Shi River line. He Zhuguo, due to the recurrence of fighting on the eastern front, arrived in Luan by special train from Ping at 10:00 AM on the 1st and will go to the front line to command the battle. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) Front telephone report: At about 10:00 AM this morning, the Shimen Village fort was broken through by more than a thousand enemies through Pantao Yu and Yashui River after Shuizhai Yu. Jia Battalion of our Jin Regiment's support team immediately engaged the enemy in battle, charging back and forth repeatedly for more than ten times. The enemy did not succeed. Subsequently, it was surrounded by more than two thousand follow-up infantry and cavalry.

This continued for more than two hours. The positions on Diao tribe and the high ground to its south were almost leveled. However, the soldiers, determined to share their fate with the positions, were still engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy in that area until Shen time (3-5 PM). In summary, the enemy's forces on the front are estimated to be about four thousand, with Japanese troops accounting for two-thirds and traitorous troops accounting for one-third.

According to reports, he vowed to lead his troops to resist Japan to the death and decided to fight to the end. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters failed to attack Xifengkou and Luowenyu. On the 21st of last month, it mobilized Japanese troops stationed in the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang and concentrated them in Suizhong in western Liaoning. A total of more than twenty trains arrived in Qian Suo. After all disembarking, they marched on foot to Jiunmenkou and joined forces with the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army of Li Jichun, organized by puppet troops. On the afternoon of the 30th, several dozens of enemy outposts and reconnaissance cavalry were discovered in Xiangshui of Jiunmenkou by the Wang brigade Pu regiment of our defending army. Both sides exchanged fire with rifles. Early in the morning of the 31st, more than three hundred Japanese troops, along with more than twenty new-style armored vehicles, launched a fierce attack on Shahe Village. Because our forces were weak, we voluntarily withdrew to Shimen Village. After the enemy occupied Shahe Village at noon on the 31st, they increased a large number of troops, totaling about six thousand, and took a large encirclement formation against our Shimen Village. Twenty enemy aircraft covered and exploded our army at 4:00 PM, but our army remained unmoved. In the evening, they changed to volley fire, and the battle was even more intense than Yuguan. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>

On the morning of the 31st, they launched a main attack on Shimen Village, first with two aircraft to suppress our Xiangshui sentries, and then covered more than two thousand infantry, cavalry, and artillery to fiercely attack us. By noon, they had broken through our Shahe Village position and advanced towards Shimen Village. Our army fiercely attacked from the southwestern and northwestern highlands, and the enemy began to retreat. On the evening of the 31st, the enemy increased their forces in Shahe. There should be a more intense battle in the morning of the 1st. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Lin Yu] On the 30th, the enemy's combined infantry, cavalry, and artillery forces of more than two thousand from the Jiunmenkou area fiercely attacked our [ ] army [ ] division Shahe Village position from morning to noon, advancing repeatedly despite repeated setbacks. Our officers and soldiers responded calmly. [ ] Regiment Commander personally went to the front line to command, and morale was extremely high. However, as of 1:00 PM, the enemy had engaged in hand-to-hand combat four or five times. Enemy artillery fired more than five hundred rounds, and aircraft dropped countless bombs, resulting in numerous casualties. The enemy suffered even more casualties than us, and we captured more than a hundred enemy rifles, more than ten machine guns, and two mortars. At about 2:00 PM on the same afternoon, enemy Japanese and puppet troops, about a regiment in strength, were also discovered on the line north of Qiuziyu, Laoye Temple, Yangzhuang, and Bangshui Cliff on the left flank of the Shimen Village position. They made contact with our Du regiment and the Yi army Zheng Guilin's unit. At 3:00 PM, there was also fierce fighting. By dusk, the enemy on the front gradually increased their superior forces and encircled our Shahe Village forward position on three sides. Our Fourth Company of the garrison was almost completely wounded and damaged, and then withdrew to the Shihe Village main position and took the opportunity to counterattack. At 12:00 PM, [ ] Division Commander ordered Jin Regiment Commander to lead Ding Battalion to counterattack, and at the same time sent strong forces to reinforce the counterattack to Dayu Ridge. The enemy stubbornly resisted, and for a time, smoke and fire filled the air, and the battle was chaotic until dawn. Our army suffered countless casualties, and the situation was so tragic that it was rare in past battles. At this time, more than ten Japanese aircraft came again and circled and bombed. Our army had no choice but to withdraw to the Shimen Village main position. At the same time, the enemy on the right flank fiercely attacked Qiuziyu, and the situation was also very dangerous. At this moment, a certain division commander of our army led the reserve team and rushed to the front to command the various parties in fierce battle with the enemy. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>

Since noon on the 31st, they have repeatedly pounced on our positions, but have been bravely repelled by our army. The enemy is extremely stubborn. Until the time of the telegram, they are still in fierce battle. The enemy used twenty-four aircraft from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM on the 31st to wantonly bomb our positions in the Shimen Village area in shifts. Our army suffered heavy casualties, but the enemy also suffered many casualties due to being repeatedly repelled by us. The enemy attacking this time were all wearing yellow woolen uniforms and red-edged hats and planted the flag of Blue Sky White Sun, obviously the Japanese army deliberately trying to confuse the situation, but when questioned by the Japanese side, they claimed to be the National Salvation Anti-Japanese Army. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>

Our army has already arranged and consolidated the defense fortifications, and is now waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. Army Commander Sun Dianying is stationed on the front, supervising the troops to hold Dolon. The Yi armies Feng Zhanhai and Liu Zhendong are gathering in various places, and their strength is not weak. Japanese aircraft bombed Dolon last week, and except for slight damage to civilian houses and horses, there was no damage. It is now reported that there are only five or six hundred Japanese troops in the Chengde area. In addition, most of them are puppet troops and Mongolian bandits, and the enemy's many harassments are mostly not formal troops. The Rehe militia and Lian Zhuanghui are deeply resentful of the enemy, and often launch sneak attacks at night. The enemy is unable to prevent them and feels very difficult to deal with.

<p>(Washington) Yosuke Matsuoka, the Japanese representative to the League of Nations, visited the US President at the White House today, and then visited Secretary of State Hull at the State Department. However, neither time did they discuss international relations. According to Hull, Matsuoka's visit was entirely a courtesy call and did not mention issues related to the United States and Japan. It is said that it was agreed in advance not to discuss such matters, because Matsuoka has no formal representative status in Washington. However, Matsuoka will stay in Washington for several days, and the Japanese Embassy has arranged many social events to allow him to have ample opportunities to lobby and communicate with US officials close to the government. However, the discussion will be limited to explaining Japanese policies, without any practical proposals. Although there are rumors that Matsuoka will propose a new agreement to maintain peace in the Pacific, it is probably not credible. (31st Day Guomin Telegram)</p>

It is said that Arita's visit to China also carries the mission of the zaibatsu. However, the warlord Araki faction is deeply afraid that this will cause discouragement in morale and differences in opinion, disrupting domestic pace.

<p>British Warship Arrives at Yingkou</p>
<p>Captain Rawlinson of the steamer "Nanchang" from Niuzhuang today recounted to a Reuters correspondent here the circumstances of encountering pirates on April 29th, stating that on that day, the crew was having lunch in the main dining room when suddenly, they heard intense gunfire. They immediately stood up, intending to investigate, but saw that pirates had already jumped onto the deck from the side of the ship. He rushed to the upper-level radio room to send a distress signal, but the radio operator was not in the room. He then went to his cabin to retrieve a firearm. Upon returning to the main dining room, it was empty. He went to the bridge and saw pirates throwing four crew members, including Bai Lu, into a small boat. At that time, Chief Engineer Jeffrey, whose cabin was conveniently located on the starboard side, was unable to retrieve a firearm, so he ran to the engine room. Rawlinson then learned that the remaining crew members, while running to the portside cabins to retrieve firearms, had been subdued by the pirates and forced into the boat. Rawlinson urgently ordered the Chinese sailors to raise the anchor and pursue the pirate boat. However, they had to stop when the pirate boat entered a shallow river. By this time, a distress signal had been sent, but there was no response. Later, a pilot arrived, and they sailed into Niuzhuang. According to the Chinese sailors, the pirates were all wearing gray uniforms. After boarding, they only asked where the crew members were, as they specifically wanted to capture the captain and the first mate. (Reuters dispatch from one day ago)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) All cadets of the Army University unanimously decided to send a plea by telegram asking Yang Jie to stay on, because since Yang Jie took over as president, he has reformed and reorganized the university and made many plans. Over the past year, the results have been remarkable, and the cadets have benefited greatly. Now that they have heard that Yang Jie is determined to resist Japan and resolutely resign, they have unanimously decided to send a telegram pleading for him to stay. The original telegram reads: "To President Yang of Beiping: We, the cadets, are fortunate to be under your tutelage and benefit from your teachings. Upon hearing that you intend to resign, we feel a great loss. Even though the situation at the front is urgent and we cannot leave the university, it is appropriate for Chief Instructor Wang to act as president. We earnestly request you to consider our feelings and abandon your resignation. This would not only be fortunate for the cadets but also a blessing for the future of the Party and the country. We eagerly await your return with anticipation. Respectfully submitted by all cadets of the Army University, with the seal of frugality." Yang replied to the cadets' telegram, saying: "To all classmates of Nanjing Army University: I have received your telegram with heartfelt words. I am deeply moved. Over the past year, I and my classmates have discussed and planned together, hoping to save the country. I cannot bear to leave due to your affection. However, we all share a determination to resist Japan and protect the country. Since I have been ordered to defend the front, I must focus on fighting the enemy. If I were to lead the university at the same time, my planning might be inadequate, so my firm resignation is for the sake of my classmates' future studies. Although I am leaving the university, my spiritual connection with my classmates will never cease. The Army University is the highest military educational institution in the country, and my classmates are all bright and learned individuals, the pillars of the nation. I hope you will work hard to study and prepare yourselves to jointly overcome difficulties and support our country in the future. This is my greatest wish. Yang Jie bows in respect."

<h3 id="e29">Visit of Mr. Kenzō Adachi to China <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Former Japanese Foreign Minister and former Prime Minister of the Cabinet, Mr. Kenzō Adachi, arrived in China the other day aboard the Japanese mail ship Nagasaki Maru. According to his own words, "This trip is merely a private visit to China for 'sightseeing'. I have not been entrusted with any mission by the government... I have no diplomatic opinions to express, but I must visit my old friend Wang Rutang during my stay in Shanghai..." On the surface, Mr. Adachi's visit seems to have no mission. However, when Mr. Adachi was the Japanese Ambassador to France, the September 18th Incident suddenly erupted. He still declared to the League of Nations that the situation would not escalate. Thinking back to those events, we cannot help but feel indignation. On the one hand, although our country's diplomacy with Japan in the League of Nations has achieved a so-called spiritual victory, in reality, Rehe has fallen, Luan Dong is in danger, and the Japanese army's invasion of China continues unabated. In addition to Uchida's diplomacy of "being willing to turn the whole (Japan) country into scorched earth", Araki's military pronouncements of "drinking porridge while muddle-headed" directly place the two countries of China and Japan in a permanent state of hostility, with absolutely no possibility of reconciliation. How does Mr. Adachi feel? On the other hand, within Japan, Prime Minister Inukai was assassinated by active-duty military officers on May 15th of last year, so-called constitutional politics has almost been destroyed. If Mr. Adachi is truly a faithful believer in constitutional politics, is there truly no so-called "mission" in this situation where warlords are rampant?</p>
<p>However, according to general observation, Mr. Adachi's visit to China is not that simple. From his statements such as "I will visit my old friend Wang Rutang" and "The Manchurian problem has come to an end, and China and Japan should reconcile quickly", we can glean that his so-called "private 'tourist sightseeing'" is a common phrase used by diplomats. Let us try to recall that when the January 28th Incident occurred, the Zhabei district was bombed, and Wusong was burned. Matsuoka Yosuke did not run around Shanghai in a private capacity until Inukai was assassinated before returning home. Although Adachi is different from Matsuoka, he is an old diplomat who has been stationed in China for many years, and he is generally recognized as a "China expert." At this critical juncture, the true attitude of our country and the international situation are all matters that the Japanese warlords urgently want to know. Therefore, at the very least, Adachi's visit has the nature of spying on the actual situation in our country. It is also possible that he is paying particular attention to finance and diplomacy.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot help but earnestly tell Mr. Adachi that China is indeed weak and has been for many years. Its military strength is not as good as Japan, and there are some gaps in its politics that can lead to a bad image to foreigners. We do not deny this. However, the national upward trend of thought is rapidly developing, and it will never be permanently subject to invasion by foreign enemies. Therefore, we sincerely hope that Mr. Adachi will first of all know that the one who destroyed peace in the East and first launched armed conflict is definitely not China but Japan. Try to recall the night of September 18, 1931, when the Japanese army used prepared troops to occupy Shenyang. Within 24 hours, Changchun and Jilin fell into the hands of Japanese imperialists. While the League of Nations was arguing inconclusively, Jinzhou and Longjiang were ravaged by the Japanese cavalry. This February, the League of Nations declared by a vote of forty-two to Japan's one vote that "Manchuria" is a puppet state and Japan is the one who created the puppet state. Then Japan is the murderer who destroyed peace in the East is very clear. Second, it must be known that at the time of the September 18th Incident, our Chinese local officials in charge were ignorant of the facts and poor at responding to events, resulting in the loss of three provinces, leaving today's disaster, and opening up Japan's opportunity to spy on North China, which led to Rehe not being defended and aggravated our country's national crisis. However, the Chinese people will never be willing to perish the country. Within the three northeastern provinces, the righteous army that repeatedly rises up and fights again and again without food and equipment can be seen that our people are generally united against the enemy. Now, we will leave aside the overall battle plan for the time being, but the brave fighting of Song Zheyuan's army is greatly loved by our people, which can further infer the direction of our people's will. Even if our country's national strength is weak, but if anger has been pent up for a long time, we will inevitably have to wipe out shame with one war. It is expected that we will never recognize that the Manchurian problem has come to an end.</p>
<p>Furthermore, does not Mr. Adachi say that "China and Japan should reconcile quickly, but China must understand Japan's position"? However, Land Minister Araki Sadao said at the beginning of his division commander's conference, "It is necessary to recognize the great significance of withdrawing from the League of Nations... establish the guidance of officials and civilians under (the division's) jurisdiction, prepare the total number of national employees, and properly handle the situation..." What we know is that Japan is only "organizing... preparing the total mobilization." Further evidence is the Japanese army's gathering on the border between Rehe, Chahar, and Hebei, spying on Luan Dong, and mobilizing troops in Dolun. The position of Japan is ultimately in armed aggression. Therefore, our reply is that we have fully understood Japan's position of assisting encroachment with force. From now on, our country should do its best to deal with Japanese imperialism. After clearing up this debt of blood, there will be peace. Please also understand China's position.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to a senior official of the Directorate General of Posts, the government of the Malayan Federation of Southeast Asia has increased the postage for letter post by two-thirds. Our country intends to maintain the half-price discount for letter post to Southeast Asia and not increase the burden on overseas Chinese. Because when overseas Chinese remit money, they mostly prepay the postage for return letters at the local postage rate. Currently, eight cents in Singapore currency is approximately equal to 1.6 jiao in national currency, which is more than a quarter higher than our revised postage of 1.25 jiao. Therefore, in reality, overseas Chinese or their families will not increase the burden. The post office has decided that the revised postage rates will begin on May 1.

<p>International Alliance Begins Boycott of German Goods as Retaliation</p>
<p>National News Agency, 31st, Berlin dispatch: The German government of Hitler finally decided at the last minute to limit the persecution of Jews, which was announced today. If overseas Jewish organizations stop their propaganda, then the boycott can be completely stopped. It is generally believed here that it is extremely important for the German government to come out and control the situation at this time. However, it is said that the government's policy will have to be announced after observing the trend of the situation. The current plan is to limit the boycott (i.e., the resistance) to only one day tomorrow as a means of punishment. However, all parties believe that even if the boycott is implemented tomorrow, the original plan will be revised to minimize its impact.</p>
<p>Reuters, 31st, Berlin dispatch: Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels announced in a radio broadcast tonight that the National Socialist Party's movement to boycott all Jews in the country will start at 10 AM on Saturday and end that evening. However, if the "cruel propaganda" made by overseas Jews is not completely stopped, the boycott movement will resume on April 5th. According to Goebbels, the "cruel propaganda" of overseas Jews has greatly declined in recent days, indicating that the National Socialist Party's boycott threats have been effective. He also said that German Jews have the absolute power to limit or stop the "cruel propaganda." Goebbels ended by saying that we want to get along with the world in peace. We want to work and do not want to make enemies for no reason. The National Socialist Party's stormtroopers are now actively carrying out the anti-Jewish movement. Although today is not yet the day of implementation, they have already started to exclude Jewish judges and lawyers from all courts in Berlin. Not long after, the National Socialist Party headquarters ordered the non-Jewish employees of Jewish-owned businesses to pre-pay two months' salary and demonstrate against their Jewish owners outside their stores at 3 PM on Saturday. At the same time, it also ordered non-Jewish store owners to immediately dismiss their Jewish employees, but Jewish owners were not allowed to dismiss their non-Jewish workers. The National Socialist Party headquarters is now appointing commissioners to punish those who disobey Jewish owners. The National Socialist Party is also imitating the methods of the Middle Ages, ordering all Jewish shops to hang huge black and yellow dotted signs outside their shops. The police chief of Altona even ordered the words "Jewish Business" to be added to the signs. Various slogans are being posted throughout the country, such as "International Jews must now admit that they cannot turn Germany into a Soviet Russian criminal colony," and denying all kinds of cruel acts of persecution of Jews. It is also said that "Overseas Jews are fighting against the German people" and blaming the Jews in Germany. Schleicher published a fierce article in the newspaper saying, "Since the Jews have started this war, this war will continue until the Jews understand that the Germany of the Brownshirts is not a cowardly one." The passports of important Jewish figures have now been revoked to prevent them from leaving the country.</p>
<p>Reuters, 31st, Berlin dispatch: The boycott of Jews will end on Saturday evening. Outsiders all see this as the Germans having admitted that if the boycott continues for a long time, it will inevitably lead to economic chaos. The cessation of the boycott must be due to the proposals of the National Socialist Party members in the cabinet. Many people believe that this anti-Jewish movement is not entirely a self-defense action to retaliate against the "cruel propaganda" of overseas Jews. The main reason is that the extreme elements of the National Socialist Party have been advocating the anti-Jewish theory for many years and have not yet succeeded. Therefore, the National Socialist Party leaders intend to use this action to calm their anger. It is still questionable whether this kind of appeasement policy will be effective. All Jewish circles are deeply worried that once the boycott movement starts, it will be out of control. Although the leaders of the National Socialist Party want it to end that evening, they are afraid that they will not be able to restrain the party members in time. Therefore, Goebbels' speech did not alleviate this kind of panic.</p>
<p>Reuters, 31st, Paris dispatch: The International Alliance has decided today to start boycotting German goods as a retaliatory measure against the German Socialist Party's anti-Jewish movement. The Alliance's boycott of German goods will begin tomorrow at the same time as the National Socialist Party's anti-Jewish movement. All those who have ordered goods from German merchants have canceled their orders. At the same time, a committee to protect abused Jews has been organized, and a large number of leaflets and slogans are being printed.</p>

<p>Havas, 1st, Berlin dispatch: The measures taken to warn the Jews were implemented throughout Germany at 10 AM today. The boycott of Jewish shops was led by the National Socialist Party and carried out according to plan. Because today is the anniversary of Bismarck's birth, many private residences, buses, and trams in Berlin are decorated with flags to celebrate. The commercial areas are quite lively. Many trucks are constantly driving on the streets, with slogans hanging on the trucks, asking people not to shop in Jewish shops. Outside the trucks, the 卍-shaped flag is used to decorate, and the National Socialist Party members in the trucks shout in unison, "Germans should defend themselves and not shop in Jewish shops." There are crowds of people watching in front of Jewish shops. National Socialist Party activists stand at the door and hold a notice牌 to persuade Germans to boycott Jews. In the densely populated areas of northern and eastern Berlin, there are many Jewish shops that do not want to open their doors, because last night someone painted skulls on the glass windows of Jewish shops and wrote the words "Jewish Shops are Dangerous." In the Jewish department stores in the central area of the city, customers are almost gone. Even the few customers are only those who are not afraid of 強禦, because there are Brownshirts of the National Socialist Party guarding the door. The National Socialist Party members do not use force to stop those who insist on entering the store, but they do ask the customers about their origin. In the western district of Berlin, especially in the Kurfürstendamm street, most of the shops are set up by Jews. Many of these shops hang the National Socialist Party flag and the black, white, and red imperial flag. The whole city was quiet in the morning and afternoon, and no major incidents occurred. Only a few customers were insulted by the National Socialist Party members when they came out of the Jewish shops. When a young girl came out of a department store on Leipziger Straße, she was surrounded by the crowd and told, "Are you not ashamed? You are betraying your country and should be arrested."</p>

<p>Havas, 31st, London dispatch: The House of Lords discussed the German anti-Jewish movement. A Jewish celebrity in Britain, former Foreign Minister and Governor-General of India, Lord Reading, asked the government to "notify the German people who have the right to deal with this matter with the feelings of the British people," without formally negotiating with the German government. Minister of War Lord Hailsham replied that although Britain is the country that administers Palestine under mandate, it has no right to intervene for foreign Jews, nor does it have this responsibility.</p>

<p>Havas, 31st, London dispatch: As far as is generally known, Polish Foreign Minister Beck recently told the British Ambassador to Poland that the Polish government has not received formal notification of the talks between Britain and Italy. Therefore, it seems that the draft Four-Power Treaty can not be commented on. However, the Polish government believes that this draft is contrary to both the letter and spirit of the League of Nations Covenant. Therefore, it makes a preliminary statement that any decisions made by the group of great powers organized on the basis of the Italian proposal cannot bind Poland.</p>

<p>National News Agency, 31st, Paris dispatch: Today, when the French Congress debated the budget bill, parliamentarians Marin and Pouillon slandered Germany and Britain. Pouillon also said that Germany should never be given equal status and allowed to rearm. Pouillon also said that Mussolini's new plan is "an extremely stupid and dangerous representative," while British Prime Minister MacDonald's disarmament plan aims to change the current treaty. Pouillon then insulted MacDonald personally at will. Therefore, Comptroller Müller had to rise and intervene, asking Pouillon to use a more moderate tone for the rulers of friendly countries. When Pouillon spoke, the right wing applauded, but the left wing mocked.</p>

<p>Acquires Shares in China National Aviation Corporation</p>
<p>Plans to Open Pacific Route</p>
<p>Two Large Aircraft Under Construction</p>
<p>National News Agency, 31st, New York dispatch: Pan American Airways announced today that it has acquired 45% of the shares of China National Aviation Corporation. Business circles here believe that this is the first step for the company to intervene in the Far East aviation route, so that it can open the trans-Pacific route in the future. According to the company's announcement in December of last year that it had ordered two completely new aircraft that could be used for trans-Pacific or Atlantic aviation, its progress plan has been kept secret. Even the details of the construction of the two aircraft have not been disclosed. It is even more unwilling to explain the trans-Pacific theory. Only according to the company's experts, the two aircraft ordered will be smaller than the German DO-X, but larger than the Sikorsky Clipper currently in use. After loading, the range can reach 2,500 miles, and its safety limit can be increased by 600 miles. In addition to mail, it can carry 50 passengers. One is manufactured by the Sikorsky Company and the other is manufactured by the Glenn Martin Company. The date of completion has not been announced. After the news of this aircraft order was disclosed, it was claimed that the company's representatives were surveying航線 all over the world, including the Arctic Ocean, and Colonel Lindbergh was also working with the company to plan the new aircraft style. Therefore, there has been speculation that Lindbergh's flight to the Far East in 1931 was not only for travel. Today's announcement of the acquisition of shares in China National Aviation Corporation reveals the company's plan for the Pacific route.</p>

<p>National News Agency, 31st, Leavenworth (Kansas, USA) dispatch: An unprecedented prison break by air occurred here today, but it was rejected by the prison guards. After a fierce battle, the prison breakers were forced to land at the army airfield and were all arrested. According to the report of the warden of the federal reformatory here, a plane suddenly hovered over the open field in front of the prison室 today. Before the prisoners could identify its type, the people in the plane opened fire on the prison guards with rifles. Therefore, the authorities urgently summoned the prison guards to counterattack at the open field. However, the plane still hovered and fired as before. Later, seeing the fierce gunfire of the prison guards, it suddenly flew away. After a few minutes, according to the report of Fort Leavenworth, the plane had been forced to land at the army airfield and two people had been arrested. The reformatory and the police authorities immediately rushed to the scene and saw that one was Barlow and the other was Norris, both of whom were criminals. However, they were still reluctant to confess. According to the prison guards, the guns fired from the plane were concentrated on the prison guards. If several people had been killed, the plane would have landed near the open field and released all the prisoners.</p>

<p>Reuters, Johannesburg, South Africa dispatch: A miraculous event recently occurred here where a crippled woman was cured after her deceased grandmother appeared to her. A woman named Sophia, who is now 49 years old, has been suffering from paralysis since July of last year. All the doctors have given up. At the same time, she also suffers from heart disease, so she has to lie down all day and cannot move. Even her hands and feet are difficult to move. Her husband had no choice but to move his wife from the hospital to his home on December 30 of last year and made a wheelchair for her to use as a substitute for walking. On a certain day at 6:30 in the morning, Sophia suddenly saw her grandmother, who had been dead for 25 years, standing at the side of the bed and saying to her, "Today is Wednesday, and your disaster has ended. From now on, you can move freely." Sophia was shocked and cried out, and the ghost disappeared. Sophia's son shouted for his father to come in. He thought this was a strange dream and not credible, and ordered his wife to rest and not move. Later, Sophia's husband went out to work. Soon after, Sophia felt that she wanted to get up, so she called her daughter to take out her shoes and socks. After Sophia put them on, she was able to stand up and move as usual. Her illness was suddenly cured. Her youngest daughter was shocked to see that her mother was able to stand up and move, and her husband was also extremely shocked when he returned home and saw his wife open the door for him in person.</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Battles at Various Passes of the Great Wall are Subsiding <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Army is Currently Reorganizing the Interior of Rehe</p>
<p>Main Force Units are Gradually Withdrawing Towards the Rear</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Beiping states that after the Japanese army captured Chengde, they advanced to attack the passes of Gubeikou and Xifengkou. Fortunately, our army bravely resisted and repeatedly blunted their advance. Furthermore, within Rehe province, local militias rose up in large numbers, and many of the puppet troops were unreliable, causing concern for their rear. The arrogance of the Japanese army has finally diminished. However, the Japanese military authorities believe that if they want to seize the various passes of the Great Wall and advance beyond the Great Wall, they would need to deploy at least three more divisions as reinforcements to succeed. Since the invasion of Rehe, most of the Kwantung Army stationed in the three northeastern provinces has already entered Rehe, leaving no more to be deployed. If a large army were to be transferred from the mainland or Korea, it would attract international attention. Therefore, the most urgent issue at present is not to seize the passes of the Great Wall and advance into Shanhaiguan, but to reorganize the interior of Rehe and gradually expand their influence. As a result, they have decided to adopt a gradual approach and have withdrawn the main force units from the various passes of the Great Wall to suitable locations. They are only building defenses in selected areas outside the passes, assigning Mongolian and puppet troops to garrison and guard under the supervision of a small number of Japanese soldiers, to confront our army. Their reorganization of Rehe first involves suppressing our western Rehe army, followed by destroying the local militias and unreliable puppet troops. In recent days, the battles at the various passes of the Great Wall have subsided. Except for Japanese planes conducting reconnaissance and dropping bombs in various places every day, and clashes between sentries, there have been no fierce battles. The situation on each front is described below:</p>
<p>(Gubeikou)</p>
<p>Since the last fierce battle at Gubeikou, both sides have been relying on strategic terrain to guard their positions, and there have been no intense battles. The main force of the Japanese army is concentrated in Pingquan. Only a small number of infantry units remain on the front lines. At the South Pass of Gubeikou, solid trenches have been dug and barbed wire has been laid, appearing as if they intend to hold it for a long time. Enemy planes frequently conduct reconnaissance and drop bombs in the areas of Shixia, Sanjiangkou, and Simatai. Our army has adequate air defense equipment, so there have been no casualties. The Central Army and a portion of the Northeast Army are stationed in this area, and the defense is solid. They will launch an attack when the entire front line sees progress.</p>
<p>(Xifengkou)</p>
<p>The enemy forces at the Xifengkou front were repeatedly reinforced after the Hattori and Suzuki Brigades were defeated by Song Zheyuan's troops, but were repeatedly repelled. They suffered more than 4,000 casualties. Therefore, the enemy first retreated to Mengziling and then to Kuancheng. Now, the main force has retreated to the Pingquan and Kuancheng areas. Only a small number of Japanese soldiers, combined with mixed Mongolian and puppet troops, are left to set up defenses and guard the area. The enemy forces outside Panjiakou and Dongjiakou have also retreated. There are no traces of the enemy within thirty miles of Xifengkou. Our army is currently searching and advancing.</p>
<p>(Luowenyu)</p>
<p>Luowenyu is a shortcut to Zunhua. Enemy troops have twice attempted to attack stealthily, but were repelled by Liu’s division of Song’s army. The enemy first retreated to Banbishan. Our army attacked and occupied Banbishan. The enemy troops retreated further north, constructing positions in the Shouwangfen area, eighty to ninety miles from Luowenyu. In addition to setting up elaborate fortifications on Banbishan, Liu’s division is also dispatching cavalry to scout towards Shouwangfen. They will advance further after making contact with other units.</p>
<p>(Lengkou)</p>
<p>The Japanese army, having failed to attack Xifengkou and Luowenyu, changed their strategy and planned to invade Lengkou to outflank Xifengkou. Huang’s division of our army had already established strong defenses there. After the Japanese army arrived, they engaged in fierce fighting for two days and nights. The enemy still retreated. Our army is now building strong defensive fortifications in the Madaogou area. Most of the enemy troops have retreated north, with a small portion still occupying small hilltops north of Xiaojiayingzi, and occasionally using aircraft to conduct reconnaissance in the Jianchangyingzi area.</p>
<p>(Jiumenkou)</p>
<p>Our army's strength at Jiumenkou is relatively weak. The enemy took advantage of an opportunity to attack on the 26th, with more than 300 infantry and artillery troops attacking our Xiangshui position. Our army calmly responded and encircled them from multiple directions. The enemy did not succeed. The enemy in this area does not intend to launch a large-scale offensive, but only to create disturbances when the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>(Shihe)</p>
<p>Due to strategic considerations, our Northeast Army is carrying out troop adjustments and redeploying new lines. The Japanese army, seeing that we have reduced our forces in this area, suddenly had the intention of sneaking in. They secretly reinforced Yuguan and sent more than 400 soldiers to test our defense line the night before last. They were repelled by our army. It is not yet known whether they will attack again. (March 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Public Indictment of the Zheng Yuxiu Case by the Prosecutor's Office <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Niu Tian Embezzled Tens of Thousands of Dollars, Yang and Zheng Colluded in Fraud</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beijing states that the Jiangning District Court has formally filed a public indictment in the case of Zheng Yuxiu, former President of the Shanghai Local Court, and others for embezzlement. Chief Prosecutor Sun Shaokang was a classmate of Zheng's while studying in France and also had a working relationship with the defendant Niu Chuanchun. However, he impartially filed the indictment to uphold the law. The original text of his indictment is as follows:</p>
<p>(Original Indictment)</p>
<p>Jiangning District Court Prosecutor's Indictment, Litigation No. 6729. Defendant Zheng Yuxiu, female, whereabouts unknown. Niu Chuanchun, male, 34 years old, from Jiujiang, Jiangxi, residing at No. 58 Shenfa Lane, Nanjing, Secretary of the Judicial Yuan. Yang Zhaoyun, male, whereabouts unknown. Zheng Huichen, female, whereabouts unknown. The aforementioned defendants, Case No. 4590 in the 21st year of the Republic of China, are under investigation by this prosecutor for the case of dereliction of duty, embezzlement, and destruction of evidence. It is deemed that a public indictment should be filed. The facts of the crime, the grounds for the indictment, and the relevant legal provisions are listed below.</p>
<p>(Facts of the Crime)</p>
<p>Zheng Yuxiu took office as President of the former Shanghai Local Court on March 24, 1927. On the same day, she appointed Niu Chuanchun as the Chief Clerk and Accounting Officer of the court. On June 3 of that year, in the case of a dispute over a deposit between Pan Xingkui and Zhou Jinifu, 470 yuan was deposited by Pan Xingkui on November 12, 1926, and was fully withdrawn by Zhou Jinifu on November 23 of the same month. However, it was re-paid under the name of Zhou Jinifu. Subsequently, similar overpayments were made in August, September, October, and November, totaling 23 accounts, with an overpayment amount of 22,502 yuan, 1 jiao, 4 fen, and 4 li. (The account names, amounts, and dates of overpayment are listed separately.) Furthermore, from March 10, 1927, to October 16 of the same year, the court successively deposited funds into the Shanghai China Bank, both fixed and current accounts, earning interest of 1,213 yuan, 2 jiao, and 9 fen in foreign currency and 32 taels and 9 fen in silver. (The detailed figures for income and expenditure are detailed in a separate copy.) These funds, along with the aforementioned overpayments, were embezzled by Zheng Yuxiu and Niu Chuanchun. On November 18 of the same year, Yang Zhaoyun succeeded Zheng Yuxiu as President of the former Shanghai District Court. On the same day, he appointed Zheng Huichen as the Chief Clerk of the Accounting Section of the court. After taking office, the defendants deposited the court's funds into five banks: China Bank, Central Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and Industrial and Commercial Bank. Except for the Industrial and Commercial Bank, which had already gone bankrupt and could not be investigated, the remaining four banks earned a total of 2,390 yuan and 5 jiao and 3 fen in foreign currency interest and 155 taels, 3 qian, and 4 fen in silver interest. (The detailed figures for income and expenditure are detailed in a separate copy.) Apart from 1,789 yuan and 7 jiao and 8 fen in foreign currency used to subsidize the salaries of promoted and super-ranked personnel, and 235 yuan, 6 jiao, and 5 fen in foreign currency and 106 taels and 6 qian and 3 fen in silver transferred to the successor, the remaining 365 yuan and 1 jiao in foreign currency and 48 taels and 7 qian and 1 fen in silver (excluding the interest from the Industrial and Commercial Bank) were embezzled by Yang Zhaoyun and Zheng Huichen successively. To cover up their crimes, they did not establish bank transaction books or interest books. All of Zheng Yuxiu's China Bank deposit books and bank checkbooks were also recognized by Yang Zhaoyun as evidence of embezzlement. When handing over to the successor, he destroyed them all. After Zhang Zhiping, a resident of Shanghai, reported the matter to the Control Yuan, the Control Yuan sent a committee member, Gao Youtang, to investigate and found out about the embezzlement. He submitted an impeachment motion, which was transferred by the Control Yuan to the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee. It was deemed that there was suspicion of embezzlement, and a letter was sent to the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office, ordering the case to be sent to the court.</p>
<p>(Grounds for Indictment)</p>
<p>The grounds for the indictment in this case are explained in parts. (A) The part concerning Zheng Yuxiu and Niu Chuanchun. An examination of the overpayments recorded in the deposit and withdrawal books of the former Shanghai Local Court shows that the payments were made successively to 23 accounts from June 3, 1927, to November 11 of the same year. The above-mentioned period was during Zheng Yuxiu's tenure as President of the court (the defendant took office on March 24, 1927, and was succeeded by Yang Zhaoyun on November 18 of the same year). In the aforementioned book, there is a private seal with the four characters "Zheng Yuxiu Yin" stamped on November 17 of the same year as proof. Niu Chuanchun served as the Chief Clerk and Accounting Officer of the court (see Court Order No. 6 issued by Zheng Yuxiu, which states that Niu Chuanchun also served as Accounting Officer, and the four types of judicial income and expenditure statements for the 16th year indicate "Niu Chuanchun, the former concurrent Chief Clerk of the Accounting Section"). Furthermore, in the aforementioned book, the private seal with the four characters "Niu Chuanchun Zhang" is stamped on the daily receipts, payments, and deposit sections, which can be used as evidence. The defendants were the President and the Chief Clerk of the Accounting Section. Since they were jointly responsible for the court's funds, the overpayments were naturally embezzled jointly by the defendants, which is undeniable. Furthermore, from March 10, 1927, to November 16 of the same year, the court deposited funds into the Shanghai China Bank, both fixed and current accounts, and earned interest of 1,213 yuan, 2 jiao, and 9 fen in foreign currency and 32 taels and 9 fen in silver (the amounts and interest rates of the deposits are detailed in the investigation report of this court). The general deposit book of the bank details the deposits, and the expenditure of the deposits and payment of interest required checks. The checks deposited in the bank were all signed and stamped by Zheng Yuxiu, which shows that the interest was all withdrawn by Zheng Yuxiu. There is no doubt. However, on the day of the handover, there was no record in the handover list. Niu Chuanchun, as the concurrent Chief Clerk of the Accounting Section, was responsible for the custody of funds. He did not inquire about this large amount of interest at all, and it is certainly believable that he jointly embezzled it. Although the defendants claim that the aforementioned overpayments and interest were secretly used by the clerk Peng Ju in handling accounting matters, Court Order No. 30 issued by Zheng Yuxiu during her tenure appointed Peng Quan as a clerk of the court (June 6, 1927). Not only did the Court Order not mention the handling of accounting matters, but Peng Quan had not signed in for duty as a clerk of the court before November 18, 1927 (the day Zheng Yuxiu handed over). It is impossible to prove whether Peng Quan served as a clerk in the court. The so-called handling of accounting matters is even more unverifiable. Furthermore, Court Order No. 12 issued by Yang Zhaoyun during his tenure appointed Peng Quan as a clerk in the Accounting Section of the court on November 18, 1927, and then transferred him to the copying room on November 24 (see Court Order No. 16). Peng Quan only started signing in for duty in the copying room on the 19th of that month, which shows that Peng Quan's arrival at the court was during Yang Zhaoyun's tenure, which further proves that the alleged embezzlement is untrue. Furthermore, the amount of embezzled funds has reached more than 20,000 yuan. A clerk who is responsible for copying, without handling cash, actually embezzled such a huge amount, and the President signed and stamped the checks, and the Chief Clerk stamped the accounts daily without noticing it. The illogical nature of their words is self-evident. The defendants believe that Peng Quan is just a minor clerk, and they can evade criminal responsibility by blaming Peng Quan for this embezzlement. It is evident that the letter in which Peng Quan confessed to the embezzlement was instigated by the defendants, which is even more obvious. (B) The part concerning Yang Zhaoyun and Zheng Huichen. After the defendants took office as President of the Shanghai District Court and Chief Clerk of the Accounting Section on November 18, 1927, they deposited the court's funds into five banks: China Bank, Central Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and Industrial and Commercial Bank. A review of the general ledger of each bank shows that the total interest earned should have been 2,390 yuan and 5 jiao and 3 fen in foreign currency and 155 taels, 3 qian, and 4 fen in silver. The Industrial and Commercial Bank has already gone bankrupt, and the interest that should have been earned is unverifiable and not included. (The detailed figures for income and expenditure are detailed in the bank account copies and the investigation report of this court.) Apart from 1,789 yuan and 7 jiao and 4 fen in foreign currency used to subsidize the salaries of promoted and super-ranked personnel, and 235 yuan, 6 jiao, and 5 fen in foreign currency and 106 taels and 6 qian and 3 fen in silver transferred to the successor, there is no trace of the remaining interest. It is evident that Zheng Huichen, as the Chief of Accounting, did not establish bank transaction books, namely general ledgers (i.e., cash receipt and disbursement books), and miscellaneous expenditure books (i.e., interest accounts) for the deposits in various banks. The dates and amounts of interest collected are completely inconsistent with the records of the banks. Her determination to embezzle in advance can be seen at a glance. The payment of interest was only based on checks (which were not listed in the books). A review of the checks shows that they were all signed and stamped by Yang Zhaoyun. It is very obvious that the remaining interest was jointly embezzled by the defendants. Furthermore, Yang Zhaoyun, after succeeding Zheng Yuxiu as President, had three China Bank deposit books and three bank checkbooks listed in the handover list. Later, because Zheng Yuxiu did not hand over any bank interest, the discovery of embezzlement would be extremely easy if the aforementioned books were kept. Therefore, he took the opportunity to destroy them all when handing over to the successor, in an attempt to cover up Zheng Yuxiu's crimes. (According to the current President of the court, Shen Xiqing, the aforementioned books were not handed over by the predecessor, as stated in the court's investigation report.)</p>
<p>(Relevant Legal Provisions)</p>
<p>In conclusion, the defendants in this case were all public officials who, by abusing their official positions, jointly embezzled public property in their custody, in violation of Article 42 of the Criminal Law, which is the crime under the first paragraph of Article 357 of the same law. Although their embezzlement was carried out continuously, it stemmed from a general intention. According to the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan's Yuan Zi No. 865, it should be treated as a continuous offense under Article 75 of the same law. Yang Zhaoyun also destroyed evidence related to another person's criminal case, which is also a violation of Article 175 of the same law. However, the most severe penalty in that article is imprisonment for one year or less. Since the incident occurred before March 5, 1932, in accordance with Article 1 of the Amnesty Act, he should be granted immunity from prosecution in accordance with Article 243, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Therefore, in accordance with Articles 253, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, this indictment is submitted to the Criminal Division of the same court. Prosecutor Sun Wei.</p>

<p>Merchants in Yangxupu Town Robbed</p>
<p>Yangxupu Town, twelve miles south of Tinglin Town, was suddenly attacked by more than a dozen bandits on the night of March 27. Armed with rifles, they scattered and looted the town. The town had no defense forces, and the bandits robbed freely without resistance. Seven or eight shops, including Nan Yuan Store, butcher shops, and grocery stores, were robbed of items such as tin foil, pork, and clothing. They left with a shout. The next day, Fan Zhicheng, Captain of the First Squad of the Zhujin Water Police Team, learned of the incident and immediately dispatched Squad Leader Wu Shirong to lead a team to search for the bandits. The bandits had already dispersed and fled.</p>

<p>Silk Factories About to Start Production</p>
<p>The silk market has been in a disastrous decline in recent years, reaching its lowest point. Only nine silk factories, including Qian Sheng, Dechang, and Zhenyi, have started production this year. However, due to the continued decline in the silk market and the sluggish sales of Western-style clothing, most of the factories' silk is for their own use. Recently, due to the calming of the financial crisis in the United States, the sales of silk in silk shops have gradually become more active. Therefore, three factories, including Huaxin, Jinji, and Yongtai, have also decided to start production tomorrow (3rd). In order to meet the needs of foreign sales, they have transferred female graduates from the Huaxin Silk Manufacturing Training Institute to serve as instructors, teaching new silk manufacturing techniques to promote innovation. Furthermore, Shen Xichun, the warehouse manager of the county agricultural farm, previously submitted a plan to promote silkworm egg planting and a budget of various expenses, requesting instructions from the provincial authorities. After receiving the report, the provincial authorities have instructed that it be approved.</p>

<p>Chen Henian, the director of the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Bureau in this county, had previously requested resignation from the Jiangsu Provincial Bureau due to the excessive tax quota and unusual tax collection, which was approved. Zhu Jianlai was appointed to take over and the tax was reduced. After Zhu Jian received the appointment, he came to Wuxi to take over and sent personnel to collect taxes from tobacco and alcohol merchants, increasing them by one or several times, which aroused the merchants' resentment. Moreover, Zhu Jian did not follow the temporary regulations of the Ministry of Finance, but illegally requested the Public Security Bureau to send police to collect the taxes from door to door. Therefore, the tobacco and alcohol merchants were filled with resentment and held a temporary joint meeting yesterday (1st) afternoon at 3:00 PM to discuss countermeasures.</p>

<p>Anti-Japanese Association Seizes Japanese Yarn Again</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 7:00 PM, four porters were seen on the river beach opposite the county's back alley, each carrying a large bag of Japanese yarn, hurrying away under the cover of darkness. They were spotted by Anti-Japanese Association inspector Ju Mingsheng, who ordered them to stop for inspection. The bags did not have the name of the consignee marked on them. When asked which factory they came from, one person replied that they were just leaving the Lunxin Socks Factory. The others quickly denied it. While questioning them, one of the porters carrying yarn ran away, intending to escape. Ju quickly chased after him and grabbed him. Looking back, the other three had taken the opportunity to escape. He then brought the person he had grabbed back to the association along with the yarn. The porter claimed his name was Qian Erguan. Someone hired him to carry the yarn to Canglong, where someone would guide him. Therefore, he did not know the exact location of the consignee. Later, he was reported to have seen the three who escaped turning west and then north from Wei Tang Bridge. Ju believed that the Lunxin Socks Factory was conveniently located in Canglong and had previously been convicted and fined. This time, there was a strong suspicion. He went to the factory for a search, but there were only a few materials and nothing was found. The Anti-Japanese Association has now released Qian Erguan on bail and will investigate further after the three who escaped are apprehended. One bag of Japanese yarn has been confiscated.</p>

<p>Sun Ke Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Talk</p>
<h3 id="e104">Central Government to Promulgate the Constitution Early <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Abolish the Provisional Constitution and the Outline of Political Tutelage, Return Political Power to the People</p>
<p>No Change in the Government's Foreign Policy, Hoping to Unite Against Aggression</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, along with legislators Ma Chaojun, Chuan Bingchang, left Beijing by train at around 11:00 PM the night before last and arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited Sun at his private residence on Columbia Road yesterday morning. Sun stated that the Central Government had decided to convene the National Assembly early, promulgate the Constitution early, open up political power, and return it to the people. Sun also stated that there would be no change in the Central Government's foreign policy, hoping that the whole country would unite and mobilize to resist Japanese aggression. A summary of Sun's remarks is as follows:</p>
<p>(Open Up Political Power)</p>
<p>(Reporter's question) Does the Central Government's decision to open up political power mean abandoning one-party rule, or returning the ruling power held by a few to the majority? (Sun replied) The Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee resolved to convene the National Assembly in April of the 24th year of the Republic of China. It has now been decided to hold it earlier and promulgate the Constitution early. However, this issue still needs to be decided by the National Congress in July of this year. There is no such thing as opening up political power, because the Constitution has already been promulgated early, and the Provisional Constitution and the Outline of Political Tutelage stipulated by the Central Political Committee during the period of political tutelage have become obsolete. The government has already returned political power to the people. Since political power is owned by the people, there is no such thing as opening it up. (Question) Will one-party rule be abandoned at that time? Does the Constitution need to explicitly stipulate that people are allowed to freely establish political parties? (Answer) Since the Constitution is promulgated and the people have the freedom of assembly and association, then the establishment of political parties is also allowed by the Constitution. There is naturally no need to explicitly stipulate it in the constitutional provisions.</p>
<p>(Participation in Politics)</p>
<p>Mr. Sun also said that the organization of the National Political Participation Council is currently under review by the Legislative Yuan. The National Congress is now scheduled to be held in July, deciding on the issue of convening a temporary National Assembly. There is no need to convene the Political Participation Council, because the National Assembly is the highest organ of the government, and the Political Participation Council is only a public opinion organ during the transitional period. If the National Assembly is convened early, the Constitution must of course be promulgated early, and its drafting period must also be shortened. As for the organizational law and election law of the National Assembly, the principles can be decided by the Central Political Committee next week.</p>
<p>(Unite Against Aggression)</p>
<p>The government has no diplomacy to speak of with Japan. Ambassador Jiang has also been summoned back to the country. From now on, there will only be diplomacy if we can resist Japan. This consistent policy has not changed. The Central Government's anti-Japanese military policy is first to consolidate the position, so that we can recover lost territory if we attack, and maintain existing territory if we defend. Otherwise, we cannot talk about attacking if we cannot even defend. Therefore, unity is the prerequisite for national mobilization. To achieve the goal, we must reform politics and increase our strength. What we are distressed about now is that China is not a purely unified country, and government orders cannot reach the border provinces. Local autonomy has not yet been completed, and there is a gap between public opinion and the government. Therefore, the majority opinion is (1) to concentrate and unite national public opinion, convene the National Assembly early, promulgate the Constitution early, and open up political power; (2) to reform politics, so that the central government and the provinces can work together effectively and strictly abide by discipline; (3) to vigorously promote local autonomy and communicate public opinion. Only when these three things are completed will there be strength to resist Japan. Otherwise, everything will be empty talk and will not help in reality.</p>
<p>(Hoping that Feng Will Go South)</p>
<p>Sun finally said that the Central Government has been hoping that Feng Yuxiang will go south since last year. There have been exchanges of letters and telegrams, and people have been sent to Zhangjiakou to urge him. I speculate that Feng will be able to take considerable responsibility, but the title has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Yang Yongtai Discusses Resistance Against Japan and Bandit Suppression <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that Yang Yongtai, Secretary-General of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, after visiting Chiang Kai-shek in Baoding, proceeded to Beiping to inspect the anti-Japanese military affairs. Recently, he traveled south and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency specially visited him at his residence and discussed the anti-Japanese military situation in the north and the bandit suppression military situation in the three provinces, as follows:</p>
<p>(Anti-Japanese Military Affairs in the North)</p>
<p>Mr. Yang stated that since the fall of Chengde on the 5th of last month, large numbers of Northeast Army troops outside the pass have retreated into the pass. Chairman Chiang, recognizing the urgency of the situation, urgently went north from Hubei to sit in Baoding and direct military affairs with the highest authority. Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, Guan Linzheng, Xu Tingyao, and others are resisting fiercely. On one hand, troops are being mobilized and defenses are being relieved one after another, preventing the enemy from succeeding. Moreover, our army's morale is high and its will is firm. From the inspection, it can be said that the anti-Japanese military situation in the north is quite good.</p>
<p>(Bandit Suppression Work in the Three Provinces)</p>
<p>The reporter further inquired about the bandit suppression situation in the three provinces during the anti-Japanese period. Mr. Yang stated that while the north is striving to resist Japan, the bandit suppression work in various provinces is also very tense. After the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, the communist bandits in Jiangxi and Hubei immediately stirred up trouble. Subsequently, when the January 28th Shanghai Incident began, the communist bandits again launched a counterattack. The situation has been the same since the incidents in Yuguan and Rehe. In recent days, the communist bandits have remained quite rampant. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also recognized this, so before going north, he first went to Jiangxi to make arrangements before proceeding north. The current bandit suppression work is taking a containment approach to prevent them from scattering and causing disturbances. Fortunately, the Fujian and Guangdong armies are effectively coordinating the encirclement, so Chairman Chiang's bandit suppression plan will not be affected.</p>
<p>(Inaccurate Information About Liu Zhi's Acting Position)</p>
<p>The reporter then asked Mr. Yang about the claim that Liu Zhi was acting as the commander of the bandit suppression forces in the three provinces. He replied that this claim had been repeatedly seen in the newspapers before, but it was not true. The claim that Liu Jingfu (Zhi) was acting as the commander of the bandit suppression forces in the three provinces is completely inaccurate. After Chairman Chiang went north, the bandit suppression work in the three provinces is being managed by the headquarters personnel and the chief of staff.</p>
<p>(Chiang's Visit to Shanghai Undecided)</p>
<p>The reporter asked about the date of Chairman Chiang's visit to Shanghai. He replied that he had heard in Beijing a few days ago that there was an intention to come to Shanghai, but it was not yet decided whether he would come to Shanghai and when. Chairman Chiang will go north again after leaving Beijing and will not be able to return to Wuhan for a while. He (Mr. Yang) will also go north once more and then return to Wuhan.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Yesterday's Welcome to Zhu Ziqiao by the Volunteer Army Relief Association <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Reports on Relief Efforts</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association held its fourth membership meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Association yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, welcoming General Zhu Ziqiao. Members Shen Junru, Chu Huiseng, Yin Zhiling, Wu Shan, Huang Jingwan, Yan Zhifang, Lin Kanghou, (Wang Gengtang Dai), Pan Xulun, Yin Zhufu, Yu Zhongxian, and Chen Ya’fu attended. Those present included the association's secretary, Yang Youren, and the deputy commander of the 4th Route of the Liaoning Volunteer Army, Zhou Juemin, and Major General Counselor Feng Mingyi, and over fifty others. Chairman Chu Huiseng of the Presidium first reported that General Zhu Ziqiao was invited by various Shanghai organizations last year to preside over the volunteer army in Ping for ten months and made outstanding achievements. There are currently 300,000 troops on the front line, all of whom rely on General Zhu's distribution of relief supplies. At the same time, he also has to take care of the resettlement of refugees, so we admire General Zhu very much and have come to welcome him. Mr. Li Cishan wrote a letter saying that if it were not for General Zhu's maintenance, the volunteer army in the north would be in an even more unimaginable situation, which moves us even more. Then General Zhu reported on the situation at the front, saying, "Fellow colleagues, I really don't deserve the word 'welcome'. I have not seen you all for more than eight months since I went north. I have come to Shanghai this time to report to you on relief matters. After I arrived in Ping, I saw that the situation of the volunteer army was difficult. We stood on the position of the people and negotiated with the government, which often took two days. Suspicions arose in the process. We believe that to save the people, we should stand on the same line, but the government was uneasy, so the Ministry of Military Affairs sent five people, and the Beiping Military Sub-Committee, not wanting people from the south, added ten more people to supervise. We have no party affiliation, no background, and we feel difficulties everywhere. After Japan obtained the Northeast, the local grain production was low, and railway transportation was cut off, making people feel insecure in the Northeast. The volunteer army can only harass, but the national army has no air defense weapons and cannot resist the enemy, so the volunteer army cannot hold on firmly. In the past, it could persist for a long time, and the results were generally good. After the volunteer army was incorporated into the government, passports were issued for replenishment, which was more convenient than before. At that time, the Heilongjiang troops fought hard in Rehe and lacked relief supplies. Each department sent people to me, saying, 'You are always giving out relief and cannot help us.' So we talked about finding a way to get some cotton clothes, leather clothes, leather hats, socks, and shoes, buying them separately, which was economically difficult, and there was no way to transport them, relying entirely on the full support of the local people, which at least kept the volunteer army from freezing to death. The supply of bullets could reach various counties in Liaoning and Pingkang. Rehe was barren and the people were poor, which made it even more difficult. Initially, the Relief Association opened a military committee, and people were sent by the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Beiping Military Sub-Committee, and the Staff Headquarters to jointly preside over it. Later, because Zhang wanted unification, there was a 'Ma Telegram' that the bullets for the Rehe and Rehe border armies were controlled by the Military Sub-Committee, and the Relief Association then handled the transfer. The Military Sub-Committee first took over the troops in Jilin and Heilongjiang who had sufficient strength, and ignored the small part, which made people feel uneasy. The original plan to destroy various routes in the Northeast could not be implemented at all, and it was calculated by the Japanese. Rehe was lost. The food for the troops in Lingyuan and other places had no way to be solved, and it was also supplied by the Relief Association. Also, when Song's troops were at Gubeikou, one regiment was grateful to tears after receiving grain and bullets from the association, and fought to the death. Guan's soldiers were thinly dressed and could not keep out the cold when they arrived in Gubeikou. I did my best to provide cotton clothing. Now Xu’s Army Commander, Huang’s Division Commander, and Song’s Army Liu’s Division Commander, and others, can truly fight. Since the National Army sent troops, the Japanese army has been trying its best to disrupt the activities of the National Army’s Volunteer Army, and is actively destroying them. Now at a critical juncture, we must redouble our efforts to assist the Volunteer Army. Deng Tiemei, Lao Beifeng, and Geng Jizhou have all been given large amounts of relief separately. We hope that this work should be done without saying, or say it without doing it. Today, we should report, so I have roughly reported the details of the process and the current situation as follows."</p>

<p>The Ping-Yuan Association Reports on the Work of Lei Mingyuan</p>
<p>Ma Xiangbo, Zhang Taiyan, and Shen Xinqing Send a Circular Telegram</p>
<p>The Beiping Liaoning Jilin Heilongjiang People's Relief Association recently replied to Mr. Ma Xiangbo, the "Ninety-Four Old Man", reporting that the rescue team of the Renburen Society, led by the chaplain Lei Mingyuan, has been hired as the commander of the rescue team in the war zone. Because of the situation in the Xifengkou area, where soldiers are waiting for relief, and the call for compromise has risen, the Ninety-Four Old Man, together with Zhang Taiyan and Shen Xinqing, sent a circular telegram to the people of the country, requesting assistance to the compatriots of Liaoning Jilin and Heilongjiang. The original letter and Lei Wen are recorded below. Also, Zhang Taiyan said to a reporter from the New Voice Society that during the Shanghai battle, it was easy to go to the Wusong area to rescue soldiers, but now the transportation in the Xifengkou area is inconvenient, and Mr. Lei's work is practically difficult, and because he is a celebrity in the international community, it is even more commendable. The government has only rewarded Song Zheyuan's 29th Route Army with 50,000 yuan. I hope that my compatriots will follow the enthusiasm of the previous assistance to the 19th Route Army and unanimously assist the rescue work of the soldiers in Xifengkou and the wounded loyal soldiers.</p>

<p>Mr. Xiangbo, I have received your letter and understood everything. Chaplain Lei Mingyuan, in view of the increasing number of wounded soldiers at the front, has joined with various public religious figures to organize a rescue team and is willing to go to the war zone to work. After coming to the association for contact, our association has hired Mr. Lei as the commander and organized the first and second wartime temporary rescue teams, and issued medicines, stretchers, clothes, pot cakes, and other items to provide relief, and introduced them to the national army in the Xifengkou area to take on rescue work. Knowing this, I am hereby reporting to you. Sincerely, The Liaoning Jilin Heilongjiang People's Relief Association.</p>

<p>Public notice to all compatriots across the country: It has been one year and six months since the September 18th Incident, and the puppet state has been established for over a year. In the past, our government insisted on the policy of trusting the League of Nations, and only called on the League of Nations, hoping that it could uphold justice, restrain aggression, and give us assistance. However, today the League of Nations has officially recognized Japan's aggression since September 18th as an illegal act in violation of the League of Nations Covenant, and has also clearly recognized that the three northeastern provinces are Chinese territory that cannot be divided, and has also denied the legitimate existence of the Manchurian puppet state. The League of Nations' clear and unambiguous attitude provides us with much assistance in terms of justice. Moreover, what the League of Nations can help us is its highest limit. Under this kind of just support, we can only truly recognize the meaning of self-reliance, self-assistance, and self-salvation. For the current Japanese aggression, we should not only make passive resistance, but also mobilize the entire nation to actively recover lost territories and fundamentally eliminate the puppet state. This is the spirit of the League of Nations' resolution, and it is also the location of world justice. If we show resistance to appease public opinion and secretly make compromises to accept enemy bait, then we are no different from opposing the League of Nations' resolution and tacitly approving Japan's actions, which is tantamount to willingly being slaughtered and willingly perishing. If I don't help myself, who will help me? Therefore, the people of the whole country should rise up together today and give the government a strong impetus to ensure that the mountains and rivers of the Northeast do not perish by our own hands, and that the Black Mountains and White Waters do not just change their colors. This is the first thing that I hope for from the people of the country. Secondly, the wise men of the past said, "Everyone has a heart that cannot bear to see others suffer." This heart that cannot bear to see others suffer is the vitality of life. Only because we cannot bear to see others suffer can we love others, and only because we cannot bear to see others suffer can we promote the great power of our lives to show that we are unwilling to be slaves. Today, the reason why our soldiers at the front line risk their lives and fight hard against the strong enemy is none other than that they cannot bear to see our nation being ravaged and slaughtered. Then, can we bear to sit idly by and watch the soldiers at the front line fight hard without giving them assistance? And can we bear to sit idly by and watch the nation suffer from the invasion of the strong enemy without rising up to resist and save it? Therefore, our work on the other hand today should also give full play to our heart that cannot bear to see others suffer, and with the spirit of going through fire and water, give the soldiers at the front line material assistance and spiritual comfort to encourage their courage to fight for the survival of the nation. This is the second thing that I hope for from the people of the country. The national crisis is urgent, and looking around the country, the mountains and rivers are changing day by day, and when we look at the future of the nation, we are often heartbroken and cannot control ourselves. We regret that we are mediocre and lack the ability to save the country. We hereby make a sincere appeal to urge our people to rise up. Our words are sad and our intentions are sincere. We hope that the people of the country will take this to heart. Ma Liang, Zhang Binglin, Shen Enfu, and others bow. April 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Front Needs Goods Urgently <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Compatriots, Rise Up Quickly and Donate</p>
<p>The local Young Women's Christian Association, considering the cold weather in the north, has specially made 1,160 silk-padded vests, which have been transferred by the local association to the front line soldiers. Their national enthusiasm is admirable. It is now heard that the most needed items at the front are trucks, cotton overcoats, and hot water bottles. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will rise up and donate.</p>
<p>Zhou Juemin and Feng Mingyi, representatives of Geng Jizhou stationed in Shanghai, yesterday received a telegram from Commander Geng, which stated (the title is omitted): "Geng Jizhou led a team of 1,500 men on February 26th and pushed forward from Baima Pass to Daban Gou, engaging in a fierce battle with over a thousand Japanese troops for several hours. The Japanese troops could not withstand the attack and retreated. Our army captured several machine guns and some bullets. The next day, the enemy sent 1,500 reinforcements and attacked us. Our army is now concentrated in the □□□ area and is preparing to attack Chengde within days. However, our army lacks wireless communication equipment and supplies. Please negotiate nearby for assistance. The Liaoning Volunteer Army Fourth Route Commander Geng Jizhou is trapped."</p>
<p>According to a report from Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, the New Medicine Association said that the battles at the front are fierce, and the enemy has suffered great losses. Our army has also suffered many casualties. The medical and rescue efforts on all fronts are extremely simple. Wounded officers and soldiers fill the roads, and their cries and groans are heartbreaking. Therefore, they have raised 650 packages of surgical cotton and 200 packages of gauze from the Weisheng Refined Medicinal Cotton and Gauze Factory, the Sino-American Medicinal Cotton and Gauze Factory, and the Jiansheng Sanitary Cotton Material Factory, and have requested the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association to forward them to the front line for treatment.</p>

The telegraph registration number is (CROOC), which is the only agency of the central government that receives patriotic donations from overseas Chinese. After receiving donations, the General Collection Office will transfer them to the Overseas Chinese Donation Management Committee for careful management and will properly allocate and use them in accordance with the wishes of the donors. It is reported that the members of the Management Committee are Lin Sen, Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, Wang Youren, Yu Youren, and Wang Members.

<h3 id="e112">Fishermen and Merchants Oppose Fees <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Presented to the Central Government</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Fishery Improvement Committee of Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces under the Ministry of Industry outside the West Gate of Shanghai, it was decided to levy a fishery construction fee of two percent of the value of whitebait. After the fishermen and merchants of Sijiao, Shengshan, Huanglong, Chongming, Dinghai, and Daishan along the coast heard the news, they became panicked and filed a joint petition, appealing to the National Government and the Executive and Legislative branches to allow the prohibition of the imposition of this tax in order to alleviate the suffering of the people of Jiangsu. The presentation is transcribed below: Presentation regarding the violation of government orders by the Fishery Improvement Committee of Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces under the Ministry of Industry, the illegal levy of fishery construction fees, requesting swift prohibition in order to uphold government orders and alleviate the suffering of the people of Jiangsu. It is noted that in recent years, the violent Japanese neighbors have continued to invade and fish, and the inherent fishing industry of our country has been declining day by day, and the livelihoods of fishermen have been on the verge of collapse. If it were not for the government's advocacy, how could a line of life be opened up to save the dying? I humbly read the order of our National Government on March 28th of the 20th year of the Republic, exempting fishing taxes, in order to show that the fishing industry of our country is declining day by day, and if there is no active promotion, it is not enough to remedy the situation and plan for revitalization. Now, all fishing taxes and fishery taxes are exempted, and henceforth, no matter what agency, no other name shall be established to levy such donations and taxes, in order to live up to the government's ultimate intention of abolishing harassment and protecting the fishing industry. Under the government's care and protection, it will gradually have a day of revival. Unexpectedly, not long after, there was an organization of the Fishery Improvement Committee of Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces under the Ministry of Industry. I read in recent reports that the committee has decided to levy a fishery construction fee of two percent of the value, claiming that it has been approved by the Ministry of Industry for implementation. The government clearly ordered that no agency should establish other names to levy such donations and taxes, but the committee has already established other names to collect heavy levies, fearing that it will not be enough. In the government's clear order, it said that it would abolish harassment and protect Shanghai's industry, but the committee has already harassed and imposed unreasonable burdens, fearing that it will not be enough to destroy the fishing industry. In the government's clear order, it was so announced to our people, but the committee has already destroyed it without any scruples. Moreover, the committee is named the Fishery Improvement Committee, so the committee should think about how to gather ideas, brainstorm and design to improve the fishing industry. However, it does not do this, but after its establishment, it focuses on discussing the collection of fees. Even if there are other proposals regarding the fishing industry, they are only the views of frogs at the bottom of a well, and anyone with a little knowledge of the fishing industry will laugh at their absurdity. Moreover, there are election fraud and heavy insider secrets, which have been exposed by Wu Tinghua, an officer of the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Fishery Association, and published in newspapers, advertising to the public. All of these things are what fishermen and merchants are heartbroken and indignant about. Considering that since the establishment of the capital in Nanjing, our government has been working diligently and tirelessly, and its prestige is such that its orders are followed immediately, but the Fishery Improvement Committee of Zhejiang and Jiangsu is the only one who dares to destroy the prestige of our government, dares to violate the clear orders of our government, and only calls on your court to quickly approve the prohibition of the levy of this fishery construction fee in order to uphold government orders and alleviate the suffering of the people. I am anxiously awaiting your order to present this, and I respectfully submit it to the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan of the National Government. Fishermen and merchants of Dinghai, Feng Yiying, and fishermen and merchants of Chongming, Xu Jingshan, and others submit together.</p>

<p>Details of Liao Chengzhi's Bail</p>
<p>Liao Chengzhi, the son of the martyr Liao Zhongkai, was detained by the Public Concession Police on the 28th of last month and charged with communist suspicion by the Second Branch of the High Court. After a review trial the day before yesterday, he was transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. That night, his mother, Madam He Xiangning, personally went to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to bail him out, and was accompanied home by Director Wen of the Bureau. Sun Ke, Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, and others visited her yesterday. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Bail the Night Before Last <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Liao Chengzhi was transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau by a ruling of the Second Branch of the High Court yesterday and was taken back to the Public Security Bureau by Inspector Lu of the Municipal Public Security Bureau on the evening of the previous day. Liao's mother, Madam He Xiangning, had been ill in bed recently due to missing her son. That night, upon learning that her son had been transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, she struggled to get up and, supported, went downstairs. Accompanied by Zhongwei Liu Yazi and lawyer Wu Kaisheng, she went to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to visit her son. The Municipal Public Security Bureau then agreed to bail him out. Liu Yazi and He Xiangning provided the bail, and by about 11 PM, all the procedures had been completed. Liao Chengzhi was released and returned to his residence with his mother to rest.</p>

<p>Ms. He Xiangning, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter yesterday morning, said that since her youngest son, Liao Chengzhi, was arrested, the military and political authorities, considering the friendship with her late husband Liao Zhongkai, have worked hard to rescue him and secure his release. She of course expresses her gratitude. However, her late husband Liao Zhongkai always held a spirit of universal love. She deeply hopes that the military and political authorities will consider Mr. Liao's past friendship and, with the spirit of rescuing Mr. Liao's descendants, rescue political prisoners nationwide so that they can work together to overcome national difficulties and save China from this critical moment. This would be most fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Liao Chengzhi Speaks <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Ms. He then introduced her son, Mr. Liao Chengzhi, to meet with the reporter. Mr. Liao recounted the events of his arrest, saying, "I returned to China from Germany just over a month ago. On the 28th of last month, I was instructed by my mother to go to No. 9, Lifu Lane, Shanxi Road, to meet with tea merchant Ouyang Chun to order tea leaves to be transported to the Northeast to comfort the soldiers on the front lines. Unexpectedly, as soon as I entered, Mr. Ouyang was not there, and I was immediately arrested by inspectors from the Municipal Public Security Bureau and held in the Laozha Gate Police Station. It was not until yesterday that I was transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. That evening, I was released on bail through Mr. Liu Yazi and my mother. As for myself, I have never known what communism is, and I have no political affiliations."</p>

<p>According to the responsible spokesperson of the Municipal Government, regarding the case of Liao Chengzhi, because Liao's mother, Ms. He Xiangning, is deeply concerned about her son and bedridden, she was granted bail, subject to being summoned at any time. Yesterday, Mr. Liu and Ms. He were responsible for his release on bail. As for this case, Liao Chengzhi is only suspected, so he will still be transferred to the responsible authorities for trial according to law, in order to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>Reporting to Various Parties on Ma Zhanshan's Return to China</p>

Mr. Du arrived in Shanghai from Ping yesterday morning to report to various parties. The "Riri News" reporter interviewed him at his lodging yesterday, and he spoke in great detail. The report is as follows:</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Chairman Ma Xiufang was deeply saddened by the national crisis and took the lead in resisting the enemy. After years of bitter fighting, he retreated to Tomsk in Russian territory on December 10th of last year due to exhaustion of ammunition and lack of reinforcements, along with Commander Su Bingwen and Brigade Commander Zhang Dianjiu. Later, Generals Li Zhichu and Wang Delin also successively retreated to Russia. In total, the troops of Su, Li, and Wang amounted to more than 11,000 people, who have been transported by government remittances to the border between Russia and Xinjiang, and transferred to Tacheng and Dihua. Those in Tomsk, in addition to the three generals Ma, Su, and Zhang, also included Secretary-General Han Liru, one secretary each for English and Russian, Adjutant Li Zhizhi, Director of Military Affairs Dong Linchang, Director of Telecommunications Liu Zilan, and Mrs. Su Bingwen, Chief of Staff of Su's army, Xie Ke, and other officers above the rank of colonel and their families, totaling more than 100 people. Originally, they planned to return to China together via Europe, but due to limited travel funds, only ten people could go together. Han Liru and Xie Ke were to accompany them, while the others would return via Vladivostok. General Li Zhichu would depart from Khabarovsk, and General Wang Delin would depart from Chengzi, both heading to Moscow at the same time. When I left Russia, Chairman Ma personally wrote several letters, instructing me to deliver them to various key figures in the central government. After arriving in Ping, I have already personally delivered the letters to He Yingqin and Chen Lifu. When passing through Nanjing, I also visited Ye Chucang to report. As for Chairman Ma's letters to Lin Zichao, Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and Wu Tiecheng, they have all been mailed. Chairman Ma's will to resist Japan is very firm, and many of his troops are lurking in Heilongjiang. He expressed that after returning to China, he would vow to lead his troops to continue killing the enemy. The letters also explained this intention. I was ordered to return to China first. This time, I came south to report everything to all circles in Shanghai, as well as Mayor Wu Tiecheng and General Zhu Ziqiao. Zhang Datong, Shen Shoumin, and Zhan Zhenhuan, the Magistrate of Hailun County, who returned with me, are still staying in Ping. The Magistrates of Shivei and Qiqian counties, both surnamed Li, are also still in Russia and will also return to China via Vladivostok. At the end, the reporter asked Mr. Du about the whereabouts of Lang Guanpu, the Acting Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government. He replied that Mr. Lang, along with Zhou Weitai, the Director of Industry, and Wang Xianzhang, the head of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, are all in Ping. When Chairman Ma returns to China, he will come to Shanghai to meet with them, he said.</p>

<h3 id="e128">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Establishes a Donation Collection Point to Aid the Northeast <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Based on the Request of More Than Seventy Public Associations</p>
<p>Entrusting Banks and Money Shops to Collect Donations on its Behalf</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce decided to establish an office for collecting donations to aid the Northeast at its 32nd Standing Committee meeting yesterday, appointing Luo Qinghua as the director of the office, and designating banks and money shops as collection points. At the same time, it issued a declaration, the original text of which is recorded below: "Since the Northeast was lost, righteous soldiers have been shedding blood and fighting hard in the desolate borderlands. This Chamber has organized a Northeast Refugee Relief Association in conjunction with various sectors. Now, based on the request of more than 70 public associations such as the silk, cotton, and weaving industries, the majority of the monthly donations for this item are actually contributed by the business community. In order to rectify the name and define responsibilities, and to arouse the self-awareness and sense of responsibility of the business community, it is appropriate to conduct this work independently, without relying on others, in order to live up to the ancient saying of 'not shirking responsibility' and achieve the practical effect of encouraging the corrupt and weak to stand up. It is proposed that this Chamber organize a Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Fundraising Committee for National Salvation Donations, etc." This matter was referred by the Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors to the 32nd Standing Committee meeting, which decided to issue a declaration based on the requests of various industries and to establish a Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Office for Fundraising to Aid the Northeast at this Chamber, appointing Committee Member Luo Qinghua as the director of the office, and designating the China Salt Industry Bank, the Silk Industry Bank, the Sanxing Bank, the Tongchun Hengxun Money Shops, the Siming Savings Society, and the Finance Section of this Chamber as collection points. From now on, responsibility will be assigned exclusively, and there will be no shifting of responsibility. All our merchants should economize on clothing and food to help overcome national difficulties and strive to be pioneers in all sectors. This is specially declared. (New Sound)</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Chinese Women's Association for the Relief of Northeast Compatriots has had its initiators solicit donations separately. Later, it held a tea dance party at Yiyuan, raising funds totaling 30,000 yuan. Originally, it planned to remit the funds to the front lines as soon as possible, but it happened that Rehe was lost and the various armies retreated, and the situation was unclear. Therefore, an emergency meeting of initiators was convened on the 6th of last month, and it was decided to send a delegation to the front lines to comfort the fighting troops and provide relief to wounded soldiers and refugees. Ms. Shen Huilian, the wife of Ma Chaojun, Wang Xiaoying, Wei Qiongying, and Song Zhen were appointed as representatives. They immediately prepared items such as rubber running shoes, thermal underwear, padded clothes, military uniforms, gauze socks, gauze, absorbent cotton, towels, white cloth, goggles, steel helmets, and cigarettes, worth more than 7,000 yuan. It was not until recently that preparations were completed, and the goods were entrusted to the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs to be transported by train. The delegation of Shen Huilian, Wang Xiaoying, and Wei Qiongying (Ms. Song Zhen canceled due to illness) also took the night train to Nanjing on the 30th to make contact. It is now heard that the association received news from Nanjing that the delegates are scheduled to take the Tianjin-Pukou Railway train north this morning.</p>

It is heard that the Municipal Government and the Volunteer Army Support Association have given substantial support to this initiative. As soon as a suitable location is found, enrollment will begin. Three groups will be temporarily established: first aid, transportation, and sewing. In addition to providing their own stationery, no tuition or miscellaneous fees will be charged.</p>

<p>Because Rehe was lost and the Japanese invaders are now planning to expand the war zone in North China, there are more compatriots in need of relief. The funds currently raised are truly a drop in the bucket. Therefore, letters have been sent to the various initiators urging them to pay the donations they have solicited. Zhu Shui has already submitted his, and they are now actively raising funds through various channels so as to continuously provide assistance to the front lines. Ms. Cai Fengzhen, Chen Xingrong, and Song Zhen are mainly in charge of the association, and they are still very active.</p>

<p>Shaanxi has experienced water, drought, hail, and other disasters for many years. The various sufferings of its people are truly rare in the world. The Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Society at No. 12 Renji Road, Shanghai, in addition to setting up porridge kitchens and shelters in the disaster-stricken areas of the province, also purchased large quantities of relief rice to supplement the relief efforts. Yesterday, Master Qingzhi of the Sunlight Rock on Gulangyu Island in Xiamen, seeing the urgent need for relief in Shaanxi, also raised hundreds of yuan and handed them over to Mr. Zhou Zixiu to be remitted to the society for distribution. His heart of hearing the suffering and providing relief is enough to be an example for all sectors.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, stating: "To the Ministry of Finance: On the 31st of this month, we received a letter from the Cigarette Factory Industry Association of Zhabei. According to a letter from the Jingcun Cigarette Company in Wanxian, Sichuan, various cigarette taxes and levies are harsh, making development difficult. Repeated requests to the Sichuan Provincial Government for appropriate reductions have been ineffective. Therefore, a special representative has been sent to Shanghai to request assistance, and a special report has been submitted to your association, requesting assistance. Please investigate and grant assistance to alleviate the difficulties of businesses." The association inquired, "Your Ministry previously issued a consultation to the Hubei Provincial Government regarding the case of heavy cigarette tax in Xiangyang, Hubei, stating that according to the General Cigarette Tax Regulations, all cigarettes that have paid the unified tax and have sufficient stamps affixed are allowed to be sold in various provinces and concessions, and no additional taxes or levies may be imposed. If additional fees or levies are imposed on cigarettes that have already paid the unified tax, whether collected from consumers or from cigarette factories and managers, it is considered double taxation, and merchants may present evidence of the double taxation to request a tax refund. In essence, it is no different from seizing national treasury revenue to enrich local coffers. Please issue a strict order to stop the tax." The miscellaneous taxes in Sichuan Province are even harsher than those in Hubei. Based on the previous letter, it is appropriate to cable your Ministry to investigate and verify the matter and to consult the Sichuan Provincial Supervisor Liu to stop the double taxation for the sake of public convenience. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows."</p>

<p>Workers Are Panic-Stricken</p>
<p>Petitioning the Party Department for Assistance</p>
<p>Eleven umbrella factories, including Huali at No. 366, Republic Road, and other factories such as Fengli, Minhua Sen, etc., recently suddenly shut down at the same time. More than 400 workers from various factories were panicking and sent representatives to the Municipal Party Department yesterday to petition. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sudden Shutdown Eleven umbrella factories in this city, including Huali, Fengli, Minhua Sen, Dongnan, Nanchang, Sanyuan, Zhixin Ruilin, New World, Dayouyu, and Tailai, suddenly announced their shutdown at the same time on the previous day (the 31st). The workers had no prior knowledge of this, and the factories did not announce the reasons for the shutdown. For a time, the workers in various factories were panicking and reported to the Umbrella Industry Association, requesting assistance. According to an investigation by a reporter from the Dagon News Agency, it is said that someone recently planned to establish a public sales market for the umbrella industry, which is quite detrimental to the business of various factories. Therefore, the factories unanimously shut down to express their firm opposition.</p>
<p>Workers' Petition At 2:00 PM yesterday, representatives from various factories, including Zhu Jiming, Liu Changsheng, Lu Zhenqi, Shen Xiangfa, Qi Xiaolin, Cai Linzhi, Gao Shude, Zhu Guosheng, Lu Amao, Ding Bolang, and Xu Ziyu, totaling eleven people, went to the Municipal Party Department to petition. Li Weixiong, a cadre of the People's Movement Section, received them. The workers recounted that the sudden closure of the factories would affect the livelihood of more than 400 workers and requested that the Party Department quickly investigate the truth and order the factories to resume operations immediately. Mr. Li said that he would accept the request and promised to send personnel to investigate together with the Social Affairs Bureau on Monday and take action immediately. The representatives originally planned to petition the Social Affairs Bureau as well, but because yesterday was Saturday and the Bureau was not open for business in the afternoon, they changed the date to tomorrow.</p>

<p>The French shallow-water gunboat "Francis Garnier," which was anchored in the Huangpu River, was ordered to move elsewhere yesterday. It raised anchor at 2:00 PM in the afternoon to exit. When it reached the river outside the Ruirong Iron Factory in Pudong, it happened to encounter the U.S. Destroyer No. 227 entering Shanghai. Both ships were anchored and turning around in the same place and could not avoid each other, resulting in the bow of the U.S. ship violently colliding with the middle of the starboard side of the French ship. With a loud bang, a large hole, about five or six feet high and seven or eight feet wide, was punched in the French ship. The deckhouse and the second deck were completely destroyed. The stairway next to the deckhouse and a small boat and a ventilator on the second deck were all smashed. Fortunately, the bow of the U.S. ship was convex above and concave below, so the damage to the French ship was five or six feet above the waterline. If it had hit the lower part, the river water would have flooded in and the ship would have sunk. After the accident, the French ship temporarily stopped its exit and returned to the bank of the Pudong Lujiazui East First Taitong Coal Depot for temporary mooring, waiting to be repaired in the dock.</p>

<p>The mother of Guan Gongzhi, the District Chief of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Madam He, was brought to Shanghai from Guangdong by District Chief Guan when he took office in this city in order to fulfill his filial piety. Unexpectedly, his mother was old and her old illness recurred from time to time. District Chief Guan personally hired doctors to attend to her and administer medicine. For several months, he worked tirelessly day and night. However, the doctors were helpless, and the medicine was ineffective. She passed away on March 31st at Maoshi (5-7 AM). The great coffin was personally viewed and placed in the coffin at the Chinese Funeral Parlor in Haig Road at Wushi (11 AM - 1 PM) on April 1st. After encoffining, it was temporarily placed in the parlor, and a date was chosen to hold a wake and transport the coffin back to his hometown for burial next to the ancestral tomb. Hundreds of people, including chiefs of various departments of the municipal government, colleagues, and relatives and friends in Shanghai, attended the memorial service.</p>

<p>Initiating the Organization of a Farmer Relief Association</p>
<p>Nanxun Town in Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province, and Zhenze Town in Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province, are both well-known production areas of Zhili natural silk in our country. Farmers in both places rely on this for a large portion of their annual income. In the past, during the golden age, farmers were quite well-off, and local commerce also relied on it to prosper. Therefore, the gentry and people of both towns were known for their wealth. In recent years, due to the attraction of rayon and the international sales being plundered by countries such as Japan, the price of silk has plummeted, almost to the point where no one cares. The rural economy has therefore gone bankrupt. Moreover, due to the influence of the current situation, disasters have struck frequently. Yuan Hong (fields) are everywhere, and the hungry cannot get clothing and food, and the sick cannot get medical treatment. The misery of the situation is unprecedented. Now, prominent figures from both places in Shanghai, including Zhou Xiangling, Chu Minyi, Lu Liankui, Xu Pucheng, Xu Zhaonian, and Tan Songtao, concerned about their hometowns, have made a great wish, with hearts that feel the hunger and drowning of others as if it were their own. They have initiated the organization of a Farmer Relief Association. In addition to their own donations, they are also widely soliciting donations from enthusiastic people in both places, hoping to raise a large amount of money to quickly seek relief. This work is already in full swing. It is heard that there are many people from both places living abroad who are renowned in political and business circles, and there are even more who possess large sums of money. Since this concerns the relief of their hometowns, they will definitely enthusiastically contribute and jointly participate in this righteous cause. This is truly good news for the farmers of both places.</p>

<p>Display at the Mainland Market Ends Today</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Allocated 50,000, Which Can Be Collected Tomorrow</p>
<p>The China National Participation in Chicago Exposition Product Association, which is exhibiting products from various provinces and cities at the Mainland Market, will end this afternoon. Exhibitors are eager to discuss matters such as packing and customs declaration. A meeting of exhibitors was convened at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, deciding that representatives from various exhibiting provinces and cities should use A, B, C, D, or use ABCD to mark in sequence. The discussion on procedures such as reporting taxes on non-selling and selling products was particularly detailed. According to the person in charge of the association, speaking to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, Minister Song has agreed to allocate 50,000 yuan in subsidies from the Ministry of Finance. Originally, it was intended to be transferred from the central government yesterday, but due to lack of time, it was changed to tomorrow (the 3rd) for the Bank of China to allocate the funds to the Economic Commission. The amount is determined by the actual needs. Therefore, the report in yesterday's newspaper that the Ministry of Finance allocated 30,000 yuan is inconsistent with the facts.</p>

They were discovered by Customs water police officers No. 91 and No. 119, who separately retrieved the corpses and sent them to the Nanshi Life Saving Bureau for collection. It was found that the three children's corpses were likely suffering from the same epidemic plague and died, and their families threw them into the river.</p>

<p>Spreading to Nine Workshops of the Xinda Flour Mill</p>
<p>An Elderly Man and a Girl Missing</p>
<p>At the end of Moganshan Road in Shanghai West, on the south bank of Suzhou Road (opposite the Tongyi Yarn Factory), there were about 180 small boats docked, with straw sheds built on the shore, connected to each other for protection from wind and rain and for access. Most of the residents were small vendors from Jiangbei, rickshaw pullers, and workers from nearby factories. At around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a boat dweller surnamed Liu accidentally started a fire while cooking lunch. Because most of these boats were covered with reed mats and straw sheds, sparks flew in all directions. At this time, the northeast wind was very strong, so the fire quickly became uncontrollable. In no time, all the boats were completely burned. When the fire was at its fiercest, a reed mat shed caught fire and was blown by the wind to the roof of the Xinda Flour Mill's workshop to the south, which immediately caught fire as well. A total of nine workshops were also completely burned, and the fire spread to two piles of wheat stored at the adjacent Fufeng Flour Mill. When the fire broke out, the Central Fire Brigade was notified and immediately dispatched the Jing'an Temple Fire Station to drive to the scene to put out the fire. It was not until around 4:00 PM that the fire was extinguished. After investigation, the Xinda Flour Mill suffered losses worth about 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, and the Fufeng Mill suffered less damage. However, only the bottoms of all the boats remained. Fortunately, the fire broke out during the day, so all the residents and the workers of the Xinda workshop were able to escape. Although a few people were injured while running, the injuries were minor. It was also heard that in one boat dweller's family, an elderly man and a young girl did not escape. However, after the fire was extinguished, no corpses were found. Whether they were burned to death in the fire or fell into the river and drowned remains to be investigated.</p>

<p>The robbers Yu Tingrong and Zheng Ziming, both from Ningbo, together with Tang Xinhua, who is still at large, used weapons on the evening of January 30th of this year at 1:15 AM to rob Zhu Chunlin, a pedestrian, of a Walter Tweed jacket and two yuan in cash in his pocket in a dark and secluded place outside the back door of the Killing Cow Company on Croc Road in the French Concession. They carried the stolen goods and fled north. When they reached the intersection of Mintini Road and Fada Avenue in front of the Golden Great Theater, the victim followed behind and reported to the patrol officer Wang Jigui, No. 614, who was on duty. The patrol officer stepped forward and ordered the robbers Yu to stop and raise their hands for inspection. Unexpectedly, the two robbers Zheng and Tang in front, a few feet away, Zheng immediately fired a shot to resist arrest. The bullet hit patrol officer Wang in the head, and he fell to the ground. He died before he could be treated. The special agency supervisors Jin Jiulin, Chief Detective Zhang Ziying, and the patrol detectives then investigated the pedestrians.</p>

<p>The Second Special Court Attaches Great Importance to This Case</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to the Scene to Survey and Draw Diagrams</p>
<p>The robbers Yu Tingrong and Zheng Ziming, both from Ningbo, along with Tang Xinhua (still at large), on the night of January 30th, at 1:15 AM, wielding weapons, robbed the pedestrian Zhu Chunlin of a Tweed overcoat and two dollars and two cents in foreign currency outside the back door of the Slaughterhouse Company on Rue de la Grosse in the French Concession, a dark and secluded spot. They fled north with the loot. As the victim followed them to the intersection of Avenue de l'Amiral Thierry and Avenue Edward VII, in front of the Golden Theatre, he reported to Patrolman No. 614, Wang Weigui, who was on duty. The patrolman stepped forward and ordered the robbers to stop and raise their hands for inspection. However, Zheng and Tang, who were several feet ahead, Zheng immediately fired a shot to resist arrest. The bullet struck Patrolman Wang in the head, and he fell to the ground, dying before medical help could arrive. Immediately, special agents Jin Jiulin and Zhang Ziying, along with patrolmen on duty, examined the arriving pedestrians and, upon hearing the news, rushed to the scene. They first apprehended Yu, then arrested Zheng at the staircase of the Siming Hotel on Avenue Edward VII near Rue de la Soie. They also confiscated a pistol and dozens of bullets from his room, taking them to the police station. The next day, the police station reported to Prosecutor Deng of the Second Special Court, who examined Wang's body at the morgue. The body was released to his family for burial. Meanwhile, the police station, having discovered that Yu and his accomplices had committed crimes at the Slaughterhouse Company three times, summoned all the victims and escorted Yu and Zheng to the Second Special District Court. They were prosecuted for robbery and murder under Articles 348 and 285, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. The court appointed lawyers Lu Shaozong and Shan Yuhua to defend the two defendants. The various court sessions that have taken place without a conclusion have been reported previously. Now, it is learned that the presiding judge of the criminal court, Wang Gangxu, considering the seriousness of the case, invited lawyer Shan Yuhua, who defends the two robbers, and notified the police department to send Detective Zhang Ziying and patrolmen to escort Yu and Zheng. Judge Wang himself accompanied the court clerk to the scene of the incident in front of the Golden Theatre to conduct an on-site inspection, ordering the two robbers to reenact the scene of being stopped by the patrolman and the shooting. They also drew a map of the locations where the victim, the patrolman, and the two robbers were standing. They also inspected the robbery scene for a week. After returning to the court, the original plan was to continue the trial the day before yesterday, but due to the large number of cases, there was not enough time. It was changed to 10:15 AM yesterday, when Judge Wang, along with Prosecutor Deng Bao and Clerk Ren Qiyuan, specially opened the Fourth Tribunal for the trial. The lawyers Lu and Shan, who were appointed to defend the defendants, also arrived in court on time. Lawyer Fei Xizhen appeared in court on behalf of the police department. After the judge took the bench, he first ordered the bailiffs to bring Yu and Zheng to the defendant's position. Then, he summoned the victim Zhu Chunlin and Wang Jinsheng (the first victim of the robbery, Hua Xingsheng, originally lived on Guangxi Road and has moved away, making it impossible to summon him) to court, asking about the circumstances of the robbery. He also asked Zhu Chunlin about following the robbers to the Golden Theatre and reporting them to the police, and the robbers opening fire. He also summoned the father of the deceased patrolman, Wang Gusheng, and his wife for questioning. Then, he questioned the defendant Yu Tingrong, who confessed that on that night, Zheng Ziming held the gun, and Tang Xinhua, who is still at large, stripped the victim of his clothes. He, Yu, was keeping watch. After the robbery, Tang and Zheng were in front, and he was behind. When they reached the entrance of the Golden Theatre, a patrolman shouted at him to raise his hands for inspection. He immediately raised his hands and allowed the inspection. Suddenly, he heard a gunshot, and the patrolman fell to the ground. He also said that he had been keeping watch during the previous two robberies. When Zheng Ziming was questioned, he confessed that the gun was given to him by Tang Xinhua, who is still at large. After the robbery, he and Tang were in front, and Yu was behind. When they reached the entrance of the Golden Theatre, he heard the patrolman shouting at Yu to raise his hands for inspection, and he also heard the pedestrian shouting to catch the robbers. Tang told him to shoot, but he refused. At this time, he was holding the gun in his right hand, tucked under his left armpit. Tang came to snatch the gun, and the bullet flew out, hitting the patrolman. After repeated rebuttals in court for an hour and a half, the court ordered the start of the debate. Lawyer Fei from the police department and the two defense lawyers Lu and Shan debated for a long time. The court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the eighth day. By the time the clerk finished reading the confession and adjourned the court, the clock had struck two.</p>

<p>The Inspection Department of the Municipal Public Security Bureau discovered that there were Communist bandits hiding in the China General Edison Company, and immediately arrested Qin Jiarong, Wu Shuangfu, Wang Qingyi, Yang Ade, and four other ticket sellers and drivers, and sent them to the Third Section for investigation. Qin Jiarong, from Wuxi, residing at No. 18, Meide Lane, Junying Camp, Shanghai, confessed that he did not join the Communist Party, but when he went to sell tickets at No. 110 during the strike, he met a person who attended the meeting whose appearance was suspicious. As for the captured Communist reports, he did not know. Wu Shuangfu, from Anhui, residing at No. 34, Anle Lane, confessed that he joined the Communist Party during the first labor unrest. He was introduced to a Mr. Chen, who claimed to be a reporter for the Da Wan Bao, and met him because the news of the strike was published in the newspaper. The strike began at a meeting held in the home of a ticket seller at No. 65. On that day, the ticket seller at No. 29 invited him to the meeting. Later, after stealing the keys, they were sent to the home of the ticket seller at No. 18. No. 18 planned to throw the keys into the Huangpu River to frame the standing committee member Wu Yi. Therefore, they threw them into the Huangpu River. Wang Qingyi, from Shanghai, residing at No. 136, Dongjiadu, confessed that he joined the Communist Party through the introduction of Mr. Chen. The keys were thrown into the Huangpu River by Hu Shuangfu for the ticket sellers at No. 110, No. 73, and No. 7. Before the strike, he was asked to serve as the secretary, but he declined for various reasons. The district committee was the original introducer, Mr. Chen. Yang Ade, from Yancheng, residing in Caoxiewan, confessed that he participated in the strike but did not join the Communist Party. Since the case was clarified, in addition to still handing it over to the Inspection Department to investigate the fugitives, the suspects were transferred to the local court yesterday for interrogation.</p>

However, after applying chemicals, the handwriting was revealed, which seemed to belong to the general agency of the Chinese Communist Party, that is, all the documents of the National Federation of Trade Unions. The organ was located upstairs in a cigarette paper shop at No. 290, Rue Amiral Bayle. The occupants were Chen Guang and his wife, and Chen's sister Shuying. Chen Guang and his wife had escaped, so only Chen Shuying was arrested. At the time of the arrest, the detectives found a lot of white-bottomed willow cloth and white paper in her room. Afterwards, a handkerchief found in the room was handed over to the Special Branch for chemical treatment, and the principles of Communist propaganda in the Kuomintang army written in Chinese were discovered. Then, several pieces of white-bottomed willow cloth were taken and subjected to the same chemical experiment, and there was no one without handwriting. The contents were all Communist Party leaflets, notices, and books. The method of shooting machine guns and throwing bombs in the sky calculated that there were forty-three pieces of cloth, about twenty-seven inches wide, and forty-three feet long in total. It is estimated that each foot has three thousand seven hundred and fifty characters, then forty-three feet have a total of one hundred and sixty-one thousand two hundred and fifty characters. At the end of each paragraph, the type of content is written, except for several leaflets about the Shanghai Commemoration Day and the January 28th Songhu Battle, the rest are all records of the Communist Party's activities in Manchuria, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hebei, Fujian, Qin, and Henan provinces. In addition, thirty-eight copies of Red Flag Weekly were seized, the earliest of which was published in December 1931, and the most recent of which was published on March 8 of this year. It is heard that the cloth contains the actual records of the National Federation of Trade Unions' work in the past two years. A lot of white paper and light yellow paper, as well as many blank practice books, were also found in the room, all of which are thought to have handwriting. Chen Shuying, who was arrested, speaks Russian and insisted that the items found by the detectives were stored by her father's friend, surnamed Yu.</p>

<p>Pastor Lin Hongbin, an honorary pastor of the National Association of Chinese Christian Churches, preaches the Gospel and is able to practice what he preaches. He is admired by knowledgeable people. Recently, his eldest daughter, Miss Bin Fang, held a wedding with Mr. Wu Ruisen at the East Asia Restaurant. All use of tobacco and alcohol were prohibited for the guests. Moreover, before the event, a notice was printed and sent along with the invitations to relatives and friends, advising them to abstain from tobacco and alcohol. Pastor Lin also believed that the Yu Chun Society was established by Chinese people themselves, and its finances were relatively stretched. It was not easy to carry out its affairs and hold social good deeds. Therefore, there was a plan to raise funds. This time, he specially allocated all the wedding gifts of his eldest daughter to the society as an initiative for the permanent fund, and appointed Xie Yongqin, Chen Ao, Guo Wenlan, and several others as custodians to use the money to help with the current year's expenses. His utmost care for self-reliance is evident. It is also heard that after Xie Yongqin was transferred to the Jianghan Customs, all the chairmanship duties were also handled by Pastor Lin.</p>

<p>丨Sentenced to Three Months Imprisonment丨</p>
<p>Bao Kang, the six-year-old son of Shen Shenti, a Ningbo native residing at No. 58, Rixin Lane, Tangshan Road, was playing in the alley at 3:30 PM on February 18 when he was lured away and disappeared. Shen only had this son and loved him dearly, so he posted a reward notice at the entrance, saying, "If anyone can send the child back, they will be handsomely rewarded." Later, Li Changqing, a Zhenjiang native, took this opportunity to falsely claim to Shen that his son Bao Kang had been found at the home of a certain family outside the South Gate of Huzhou and came to inform him that he was willing to accompany him to find him there. Shen believed it to be true and went to Huzhou with him, staying in a hotel. All expenses were borne by Li. Later, according to Li Changqing, the child was at the Chen family's home and required 500 yuan before he would be handed over. Shen had no money. After repeated consultations, the result was reduced to 150 yuan. Shen said that he had to see the child first before he would prepare the money and take him back. But Li knew that everything he said was false, so he could not do it. He made an excuse to return together. On March 19, Li Changqing went to Shen's place again and asked him to hand over 150 yuan, saying that he would guarantee to send his son back. Shen anticipated that it was still false and suspected that Li had kidnapped him. He immediately handed Li over to Detective Shen Binkui and took him to the Huishan Police Station, which transferred him to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Because Li Changqing insisted that he was actually kidnapped by his friend Chen Jibiao, a native of Huzhou, Chen had been captured by the Public Security Bureau there. He was ordered to return to prison for a detailed investigation at a later date. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefen came to court for a follow-up interrogation. Police lawyer Zhang Dayin said that during the postponement, police detectives accompanied the defendant to Huzhou to arrest Chen, but Li could not point out the location. Now the county government there has replied, saying that there is no such person as Chen. He will present the letter for inspection. However, according to the police investigation, the child Bao Kang was not kidnapped by Li. He is now prosecuted for fraud and theft under Article 370, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. When the defendant was questioned, his confession was evasive and he asked for leniency. Judge Xiao ruled that Li Changqing should be sentenced to three months of imprisonment. The number of days of custody before the verdict is determined shall be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day.</p>

<p>Causing a One-Day Delay</p>
<p>The Qingpu ship of the Sanbei Company's Yangtze River route, which came to Shanghai from Hankou on the afternoon of the 30th of last month, docked at Wharf No. 2 in Nanshi, No. 16, to load and unload goods. Yesterday morning (1st) at about 3 o'clock, both passengers and goods were loaded, so it raised its anchor and set off for Hankou. Shortly after leaving the dock, because it was high tide and the current was very rapid, the hull was pushed back, causing the lead wire rope tied to the No. 2 River Jian Fudong Transportation Office to wrap around the engine leaves. The engine leaves immediately failed, and the ship could not move forward. Fortunately, it was discovered early. When the shipowner learned of this, he ordered the ship to stop. At dawn, he hired a waterman to go into the water and completely remove the lead wire entangled in the engine leaves. The ship then immediately sailed to the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong to dock. He reported to the company. Upon receiving the news, the company sent personnel to the ship in the afternoon to inspect it. There was no damage. The passengers did not disembark and were changed to export to Hankou this morning.</p>

<p>丨Zhang Lin and Wang Laosi are Sentenced Separately丨</p>
<p>Li Wanjin, a woman from Zhenjiang, is fifteen years old and has a slightly pretty appearance. She lost her parents when she was young, so she was raised by her aunt Wang Qin since she was six years old. In June of last year, two fellow villagers, Wang A'er and Wei Langen, lured her to Shanghai and sold her to Wang Laosi, a woman who opened a pheasant brothel at No. 609, North Hai Road, for more than 100 yuan as an adopted daughter. Every night, she was forced to solicit customers on Sixth Avenue to sell prostitution. If she did not get her wish, she would be beaten severely. Although the woman suffered grievances, she had no way to escape the fire pit. Recently, her cousin Xu Gongquan, who had opened a barber shop on Xinzha Road, learned that his cousin had been abducted and sold to Wang as a pheasant, so he tried his best to find out the truth and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station. The police station ordered Detective Wang Jiaju to go to the address to arrest her. Because it was about 3 AM this morning, Wang's lover, Zhang Linbao, was also arrested, and the woman was rescued and taken back. At about 9 o'clock, Wang Laosi and Zhang Linbao were escorted to the First Special District Local Court Criminal Court. The head of the Criminal Court, Feng Shide, took the seat and mentioned the situation at the time. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi got up and stated that Feng Shide then interrogated Zhang Linbao, who confessed that he was 38 years old and was related to Wang Laosi. There was no relationship between husband and wife. He lived in the French Concession and had a wife and children. Because there were relatives coming to his home that day, he could not accommodate himself, so he temporarily stayed at that place. He did not order the woman to sell prostitution. According to Wang Laosi's confession, the woman's father brought her last year and discussed with my father to let her sell prostitution in my place. Her father took the night's earnings. As for Zhang, he is my cousin. When the detectives came to arrest him, he was the only one lying on my bed. According to Li Wanjin's confession, my parents died a long time ago. In June of last year, I was abducted by fellow villagers Wang A'er and Wei Langen in my hometown and sold to Wang's place in Fula, Shanghai, to serve as a pheasant. Every night, I received guests and the night's earnings were two or three yuan, and the money was taken by Wang. Zhang Linmai is indeed her husband. According to Xu Gongquan's statement, Judge Feng then announced the verdict in court. Zhang Linbao jointly induced a woman under the age of sixteen to commit adultery, and was sentenced to six months of imprisonment. Wang Laosi jointly induced a woman under the age of sixteen to commit adultery, and was sentenced to six months of imprisonment. Wang Laosi jointly induced a woman under the age of sixteen to commit adultery and was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. The number of days of custody before the judgment is determined will be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day. Li Wanjin will be temporarily handed over to Jiliang for adoption.</p>

<p>From Mr. Xu Xianfu of this city:</p>
<p>The letter I wrote to you on the fourteenth has not yet fully expressed my desires. Today, I dare to present my humble opinions again for your consideration. I hope you will allow me to do so.</p>
<p>My repeated letters are all concerned with the well-being of the nation and the masses. Everything I have discussed is, in my opinion, superior to problems such as suicide, attachment to love, occupation, and inheritance. The latter are aimed at individual selfishness, not the urgent needs of the entire nation and all the people. Some may say that these problems are indeed related to individual selfishness, but they are also caused by the social environment. The so-called salvation is precisely the meaning of "accumulating private interests for the public good." Who knows that this is the inferior root of capitalist tradition, and the reason for the destruction of capitalism today? Now that we know that society is evil, we should judge its outward manifestations and seek fundamental reforms. The so-called eradication from the root will make trivial problems disappear. Why bother to follow the uneconomical and incomplete method of treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, and be ridiculed for being superficial? Moreover, the implementers of socialism must "turn their backs on selfishness for the public good." The liberation of Chinese farmers and workers, the revitalization of the Chinese nation, and the realization of international peace cannot allow any more selfishness to exist among them. However, there are many ways to reform, and people's opinions differ. Without a unified revolutionary theory, there will be no consistent revolutionary behavior. So, what should we take and what should we abandon? The youth of the popular vanguard and the public opinion that leads society have no room for shirking their responsibility. Public opinion advocates that the goal of the youth revolution lies in the laboring masses, but the tool of the revolution lies in the youth. It is not permissible to mistake the means for the end, nor is it appropriate to regard the end as the means. Therefore, valuing the youth issue is no less important than the issue of the laboring masses. This is the meaning of my sincere appeals to my peers.</p>
<p>Now that we know the importance of revolutionary theory, what is the way to take and abandon? First and foremost, research. We should use an observational eye to analyze a theory through experience, and then measure it against the facts. It should be carried out in both time and space, and should be valued. One must not immediately add contempt or blindly follow a general concept. I have often read your teachings, and between the lines, there is a sense of longing for socialism. Indeed, capitalism is bankrupt, and we will eventually have to find a way out. Socialism is certainly good, but should we not regard it as the progress of capitalism? Let's trace the history of socialism. Its ideas have been around since the rise of natural science in the 17th century. The mechanical worldview and materialistic view of life created by so-called empirical philosophy and Enlightenment philosophy have already given rise to it. To put it further, when the dreams of capitalism were still without clues, the ideals of socialism, such as Confucius's Great Harmony and Plato's Republic, had already been established. The immature practice of socialism, as demonstrated by Morgan's theory of ancient society, had also been seen long ago. To go a step further, in the midst of the collapse of capitalism, the way out is not limited to one end of socialism. Social policies, fascism, and ideal technoocracy are all derived from this. It can be seen that socialism is just one kind of conversion of the direction of applying human knowledge and technology to cope with the control of capitalist forces, which is not enough to control society. Marx's materialistic view of history holds that when capitalism evolves to the point of natural collapse, the power of the proletariat will increase and communist socialism will be realized. However, the capitalist development of the former Tsarist Russia was not yet mature, and the Bolsheviks had already established the dictatorship of the proletariat. Was Marx wrong? Or is Lenin's dictatorship of the proletariat not Marx's doctrine, as Kautsky claimed? Although both of these prove my theory of the power of governance. Furthermore, some say that we do not despise Marx's entire theory because of this. After all, China's revolutionary theory needs a lot of interpretation from it.</p>
<p>In your reply, in addition to your attachment to socialism, you also showed your admiration for the Soviet Union. According to my speculation, you believe that China's way out lies in socialism, and the model of socialism is the Soviet Union. Indeed, the Soviet Union's achievements are different from those of Britain, the United States, and Germany. However, believing in it because of the general concept of its amazing achievements inevitably leads to superficiality. Since we know this, we should also know why. In other words, we should investigate the driving force behind its great achievements. To summarize, there are roughly the following points:</p>
<p>1.  Organization of youth. According to the age distribution of the Soviet Union's population in 1900 (calculated per 1,000 people), in the European part, males aged 0 to 19 accounted for 249 per 1,000, and females accounted for 266 per 1,000. Males aged 20 to 59 accounted for 166 per 1,000, and females accounted for 241. Those over 59 accounted for 35 per 1,000 for males and 43 per 1,000 for females. In the Asian part, males aged 0-19 accounted for 256/1000, females accounted for 260/1000, males aged 20-59 for 191/1000, females for 219/1000, and the male and female population over 59 were each 37/1000. Based on these statistics, it can be inferred that the Soviet population is concentrated in young people and youths. Those who dominate society also understand this, and they are closely organizing and strictly training young people to be able to assume the great responsibilities of the revolution, such as the "October People," the Young Pioneers, the Communist Youth League, and the Communist Party, all of which have their important missions.</p>
<p>2.  Special Dictatorship. The Soviet Union is commonly known as a country of national equality and the dictatorship of farmers and workers, but this is not the case. Lenin's Soviet Russia was not the communist society that Marx envisioned, and the Soviet Union in Stalin's era was even less so the Soviet Russia that Lenin built. The current Soviet Union is a dictatorship of the Communist Party on behalf of farmers and workers, and Stalin is a dictator on behalf of the Communist Party. These are all realities that do not need to be distinguished. For example, the Soviet Constitution stipulates that the Executive Committee is organized by the Nationalities Council and the Union Council. The Union Council representatives are elected in the Soviet Congress. The Nationalities Council is filled by representatives elected separately by various autonomous regions and autonomous republics. All resolutions of the Soviet Executive Committee must be unanimously agreed upon by the Nationalities Council, the Union Council, and the Executive Committee to be valid. Otherwise, a joint meeting will be held to mediate. This seems to be a creed to respect national self-determination and take into account the opinions of minority peoples. However, once mediation fails, the Executive Committee submits it to the Soviet Congress for final adjudication. The Soviet Congress allocates representatives based on population, and the Russian population accounts for almost three-quarters of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Congress should be the largest force in Russia and can control everything. Therefore, national self-determination is only Russian national self-determination. Although this kind of dictatorship has another value that makes people pay attention to it.</p>
<p>3.  Planned Economy. The most obvious and dazzling achievement of the Soviet Union is the success of this planned economy. From Lenin's electrification plan to the five-year plan of progress, the world has already been amazed. This is the characteristic of the dominant power of the Soviet socialist country. It is true that today the dominant power of the Soviet Union has shifted the knowledge and technology of human evolution to another direction, that is, as you said, "planned, systematic, economical, and fully" development. As for the process and achievements, I believe that the people of the country know it well and do not need my elaboration.</p>
<p>4.  Abolition of Private Ownership. The evils of capitalism, such as the plunder of surplus value and the accumulation of private capital, are all just the accomplices of this system of private property. Therefore, if we want to fundamentally eliminate the misfortunes of society, we must abolish the shackles of private ownership. The Soviet Union is the only country that has implemented this policy. For example, industries are nationalized, capital is state-owned, and foreign trade is also managed by the state. In addition, agricultural farms are established, such as establishing state-owned agricultural farms as a standard to encourage cooperative farms for practical results. As a result, both workers and farmers have a sense of national identity and automatically participate in production and control production. For example, the organization of various production shock brigades is a great help to the success of the five-year plan.</p>
<p>I have finished describing the characteristics of the Soviet Union. I think of China's way out today. In addition to a few special prerequisites, all the advantages are worthy of our adoption. However, I don't know if the people of the country have paid attention to it. As for how China's entire revolutionary theory should be, I originally wanted to briefly express one or two of my humble opinions here. However, I feel that the above article has already taken up a lot of space, and the number of words below is almost the same. I am afraid that it will hinder the public's right to communicate. I will wait for the next time to correct it. I don't know what your opinion is. I have often said that we are not afraid of mistakes. What we value is the ability to seek correctness from mistakes. We are not afraid of contradictions. What we value is the ability to seek harmony from contradictions. In this way, what in the world cannot be solved? The universe is changing, life is changing, and gentlemen strive for self-improvement. With respect, I wish you progress. (Reply will be published tomorrow)</p>

<p>Discussions divided into three groups in the morning and afternoon</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 1st) Sixty-odd people attended the opening session of the Ministry of Education's Astronomical, Mathematical, and Physical Discussion Meeting on the first. It was decided to divide the meeting into three groups: astronomy, mathematics, and physics. In the morning, the groups discussed various issues. Gao Lu presided over the discussion on the astronomy curriculum. It was decided that all universities should add astronomy courses, and high schools should also add an astronomy class. The mathematics group, chaired by Feng Zugou, was divided into four categories: translation of names, curriculum standards, compilation of single-volume books, a directory, and others. Feng Zugou, Jiang Lifu, Huang Jiyu, and Zheng Tongsun were appointed as the presidium. The physics group, chaired by Li Shuhua, decided not to divide into smaller groups. Fang Guangqi, Ding Xielin, Wei Xueren, Bao Youxun, and Zhou Changshou were appointed as proposal review committee members. The proposals were divided into seven categories: 1. Translation of names, 2. Curriculum standards, 3. Instrument manufacturing, 4. List of books that must be compiled and translated, 5. National defense, 6. Popular science education, 7. Others. The group meetings continued in the afternoon. The astronomy group, attended by eight people, was still chaired by Gao Lu. Four types of books that must be compiled were decided, and the issue of astronomical translations was discussed. The mathematics group, chaired by Zheng Tongsun and Huang Shouzhong, appointed Jiang Lifu, Gu Cheng, Hu Dunfu, Cao Qianyi, Sun Guangbi, and five others as members of the translation review committee. The minimum subjects for university mathematics courses were decided, and Feng Zugou, Sun Guangyuan, Bu Qing, Gu Cheng, and Yu Guanglang were appointed to draft the content of these minimum subjects. The physics group, chaired by Li Shuhua and recorded by Qian Baojun and Wang Zuoqing, decided on the principles and minimum subjects of the university physics curriculum and the content of these minimum subjects. In the evening, the Ministry of Education hosted a banquet at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center for all members of the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Jiangsu Education Fee Auditors Resolve to Rectify Education Fees <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>All counties that have not been divided should complete the division by the end of May. In late March, the Jiangsu Education Fee Auditors discussed how to handle the large amount of unpaid land tax, slaughter tax, and other taxes at the Education Fee Management Office. Regarding the land tax rectification method, the following resolutions were passed: (1) All counties that have not been divided should complete the division by the end of May (more than 20 counties have been divided). (2) Counties with outstanding payments should allocate temporary funds and construction equipment funds for primary and secondary schools as much as possible (the total amount of outstanding payments from various counties is 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, with Wuxi, Yixing, Songjiang, Liyang, and Wujin counties having the most, with each county owing 20,000 to 30,000 yuan). Regarding the slaughter tax method, the following resolutions were passed: Those who exceed one month of deposit will be urged to pay, and those who exceed two months will be urged to pay their guarantors. It was also resolved that supervisors who fail to report the report of the previous ten days will have their salaries deducted for the current month, and those who exceed three months will be replaced by the management office.</p>
<p>According to other news, the Jiangsu Education Fee Management Office has previously requested rewards for counties that have made efforts to pay education fees to the finance bureau, such as Changshu and Zhenjiang. It has now been found that Jiangyin, Kunshan, Shanghai (and several other counties) have cleared previous debts and do not owe new fees, which is commendable. The office has requested the Education Department to submit it to the provincial government for a conference reward.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Experts Conference <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>A special experts conference was held at the Ronghong Hall of the school yesterday at 9:00 AM. Attendees included former Minister of Transportation Ye Yuhu, Counselor of the Ministry of Railways Xia Guangyu, Director of the Ministry of Industry Liu Yinbo, experts from various fields, President of the school Li Zhaohuan, Dean of the School of Management Zhong Weicheng, Dean of the School of Electrical Engineering Zhang Tingjin, Dean of the School of Civil Engineering Li Qianruo, and professors Tan Bingxun, Wang Bingnan, Xiong Dahui, and Tang Xinji, totaling more than eighty people. It was truly an unprecedented grand gathering in China's academic circles. Mr. Corderoy, a British advisor to the Ministry of Railways, and Mr. Schfranek, the U.S. Commercial Counselor in China, also attended the meeting. President Li first introduced Ye Yuhu to the experts, and then Ye assumed the role of chairman of the conference and officially opened the meeting. The chairman delivered a lengthy opening speech, lasting nearly twenty minutes, which thoroughly discussed the scope of the prepared topics for the day, including industry, transportation, and national defense. Immediately afterward, the discussion of the papers began. There were four papers in total. The first paper was titled "Railways and National Defense." To facilitate discussion, Dean Zhong Weicheng, the author, stood up and briefly presented the main points of the paper. He offered many novel insights into the various errors of China's past railway national defense policies, especially his research on the railway network in the Northeast Provinces was the most precise. He also drafted future railway policies to strengthen national defense, stating that two central points should be established north and south of the Yangtze River, supplemented by a circular border defense railway starting from a certain point and ending at a certain point. At the end of the paper, two suggestions were attached regarding military transportation issues during the national crisis: one was a strategy for rebuilding military railways in the front lines, and the other was a method for centralizing railway military organizations. (The detailed content of the paper will not be publicly released due to the decision of the conference regarding national defense plans.) The second paper was titled "Industry, Transportation, and National Defense." The third paper was titled "The Relationship Between Establishing Steel Plants and National Defense." As the authors Wei Tingsheng and Huang Jintao were unable to attend due to other commitments, Tang Xinji and Shou Junliang respectively represented them in reading the papers. The fourth paper was "Industrial and Transportation Education and National Defense" by Ye Yuhu, which was also briefly explained by Tang Xinji. Afterward, Xiong Dahui, Tan Bingxun, and Wang Bingnan supplemented their opinions on national defense issues. Mr. Xiong spoke on "The Relationship Between Shipping and National Defense," Mr. Tan spoke on "The Relationship Between Telecommunications and National Defense," and Mr. Wang spoke on "The Relationship Between Aviation and National Defense." Finally, there was a free discussion. The experts spoke one after another, some speaking briefly but meaningfully, while others debated eloquently and vigorously. The discussion of various issues related to industry, transportation, and national defense was extremely detailed and thorough. It was a pity that the time limit of the meeting prevented further discussion. When discussing a certain issue related to national defense, several experts debated fiercely due to differing opinions, and it was difficult to reach a conclusion. Fortunately, the chairman made a final decision. Ye had a wealth of research on national defense issues and had already formed a clear plan, so even when encountering difficult problems, he was able to solve them easily. In addition, the four papers discussed yesterday totaled no less than one hundred thousand words, and the supplementary or revised opinions put forward by the experts were extremely complex. However, before the closing of the conference, Chairman Ye Yuhu was able to summarize the opinions of various parties in a hurried time of more than ten minutes, organizing thousands of threads into two major outlines and more than twenty minor items, so that the first meeting of the conference achieved an extremely satisfactory and valuable result.</p>

<p>The scale of this conference is magnificent, and the layout is particularly splendid. Among them, the most interesting thing is the small train winding around the school. All management of the small railway bureau, such as locomotive affairs, train services, and finance, are undertaken by students of the School of Management. The weather has been fine in recent days, and the number of visitors has increased sharply, making the trains even more crowded. Yesterday, Huang Boqiao, the director of the two railway bureaus, and Wang Shengsheng, the head of the locomotive department, visited the station to observe the equipment and management system of the small railway bureau and praised them deeply. They bought tickets to ride around the railway for a week and praised this small railway bureau as a miniature of the domestic railway.</p>

<p>Yesterday's final result was 33-15</p>
<p>Although Jinan defeats Central in the Men's group, due to one loss</p>
<p>Will compete against Daxia in a best-of-three final</p>
<p>The Women's Championship of this Jiangda basketball tournament belongs to Jinan University. In yesterday's final, Jinan defeated Central 33-15. The Men's group has formed a standoff and Jinan and Daxia will have a best-of-three final to determine the championship, as Jinan and Daxia each have six wins and one loss. Jinan lost to Daxia, while Daxia lost to Jinling Central. Yesterday, Central lost to Jinan 22-27. Having lost twice to Daxia, they are out of the running. Today, Guanghua and Jiaotong have a makeup game at Jiaotong.</p>

<p>Jinan and Central met with three wins each. However, in yesterday's final, Jinan maintained the upper hand throughout and Central was completely subdued. Except for Fang Xichen of Central opening the scoring with a free throw, they followed from behind throughout. Jinan was tall, brave, and agile, but committed many fouls, from which most of Central's points came. Compared to Jinan, they were clearly inferior, and the absence of Central's star forward Hu Ruisheng also had some impact. Referee Zhou Jiaqi.</p>

<p>The men's match between Jinan and Central had the nature of a final. Following the women's game, Central's movements were not as agile as Jinan's. After center Xu Rukang was marked by Han Zhenyuan, the scoring opportunities decreased. Jinan scored first, and Central exceeded with 6-2. Jinan immediately adopted a strict defensive strategy. In an instant, Jinan scored 12 points in a row and were ahead with 14-6. In the first half, the score was 16-11. In the second half, Jinan still took the lead.

<p>Guanghua vs. Fudan at Daxi Road. The men's group was evenly matched. Guanghua excelled with a balanced roster, while Zhang Jinxiang and Wang Changyun of Fudan were both strong players. In the first half, Guanghua won 15-13. In the second half, each team scored ten points. As a result, Fudan still lost by two points. Guanghua won 25-23.

<h3 id="e194">The Nine Terrains Chapter - Fire <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Xueming</p>
<p>I accidentally flipped through an old copy of Sun Tzu’s “Art of War” on the bookshelf. Coincidentally, it opened to the chapter on the “Nine Terrains.” I am not a military man, so why would I study military books? However, the two words “Nine Terrains,” which I found very unfamiliar, drew me in to read further. At first glance, it said…</p>
<p>"In the art of war, there are dispersive ground, facile ground, contentious ground, communicative ground, intersecting ground, serious ground, difficult ground, hemmed-in ground, and desperate ground. When a chieftain fights in his own territory, it is dispersive ground; When he penetrates into enemy territory, but not deeply, it is facile ground. That which can be gained or lost to advantage, is contentious ground; ground on which each side has liberty of movement, is communicative ground; ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has most of the empire at his command, is intersecting ground; when one penetrates deeply into hostile territory, leaving a number of fortified cities in his rear, it is serious ground; mountain forests, precipitous passes, marshes and swamps—all ground that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground; ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed-in ground; ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground……”</p>
<p>Based on this, let's compare it with the current Sino-Japanese war.</p>
<p>In the past, the feudal lords each occupied a territory, raised troops to protect themselves, which is exactly the same as the current warlords. Internal wars such as the Fengzhi War, in which soldiers left the customs, took the three northeastern provinces as dispersive ground, making the villages desolate and the people’s lives difficult. After the Feng army won, they became arrogant and lazy, so the September 18th Incident occurred. The iron hooves of the Japanese Empire crushed Shenyang, and the Chinese army lost the facile ground due to non-resistance. If a counterattack had been launched at that time, it would not have been difficult to recover the lost territory; but no, even the rich areas of Jilin and Heilongjiang were completely abandoned, and the army retreated to Jinzhou, which was still in a superior position in terms of offense and defense. Who knew that later even Jinzhou and Shanhaiguan, a famous city and fortress, a territory which could be fought over militarily, or traded in, would fall one after another? At this time, traitors and rebels took the opportunity to organize a puppet state, raping public opinion and occupying a land with tens of millions of people. Now that the intersecting ground has been lost, the general of non-resistance only realized that non-resistance was a bad strategy, and then concentrated the opium army in the mountainous and hidden province of Rehe. You also know that if you want to recover the lost land of the three eastern provinces, you must defend Rehe to the death. According to Sun Tzu, this is already "serious ground" and "difficult ground." Unfortunately, Mr. Tang Yulin ended up giving it away. Now our anti-Japanese army is fighting along the Great Wall. Xifengkou protrudes from the front, and the left and right wings have approached the Great Wall, while the enemy takes Chengde as its base camp, using winding and narrow mountain paths, which can be used for offense and defense. Our vanguard seems to be in danger of being defeated or encircled; if there is such an unfavorable situation and we are caught in a hemmed-in ground, we can only retreat and abandon the Great Wall. At that time, when we close our eyes and think about it, what will the situation be? Therefore, if we do not actively counterattack now, we will inevitably fall into a "desperate ground." The gate is wide open, the art of war is exhausted, and North China is in danger! North of the Yellow River, I am afraid that heroes will have no place to use their strength. Isn’t it too far from what Sun Tzu said, "A good fighter puts himself in an invincible position"? Some people say: When the Han general Han Xin fought against the Zhao state, in the Battle of Jingxingkou, he fought with his back to the river, called it "putting himself in a desperate ground and then surviving, putting himself in a lost ground and then surviving." Then, does that mean that the Chinese anti-Japanese war has no "nine terrains," and is that the way it will be? Can China be revived like this?</p>

<p>— Yuanzhao</p>
<p>The prosperity of the city, on the dark side of society, is to increase the intensity of the shadows. The peach blossoms laugh in the spring breeze, but also weep blood in the spring breeze.</p>
<p>Not a single page of human history does not reflect the bright red spots of blood.</p>
<p>Hell and heaven are the urban polyphony.</p>
<p>Life is like a stream in a secluded valley; it is also like a lone sail in the shadow of the setting sun.</p>
<p>The world today is a woman's world; without women, the world would be as cold as the moon.</p>
<h3 id="e196">What kind of person is Pu Yi <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Pingcao</p>
<p>Pu Yi, who served as the puppet of Japan and assumed the role of executive of the puppet state, has long been famous. However, what kind of person he actually is, I am afraid that ordinary people cannot guess. I neither have Zheng Xiaoxu's qualifications to be a traitor, nor do I have Hu Shih's doctoral title to have the honor of visiting the palace. Of course, I don't know very well either. However, I have read his manuscript and can make a little judgment. Last year, I was in Beiping, and two cents could get a ticket to visit the Palace Museum. Coincidentally, what was open that day was the Qianqing Palace. The Hall of Longevity and Happiness inside the Qianqing Palace was Pu Yi's former bedroom. Although the person is gone and the building is empty, his handwriting still exists. Historical essays, letters, diaries, and other small pieces are all complete. Although they are not as sad and lingering as Li Houzhu of the Tang Dynasty, they are as funny and ridiculous as Liu Houzhu of Shu. Therefore, at that time, I took the trouble to copy a few excerpts.</p>
<p>It seems that Pu Yi is like a person who is determined to revive the country. His "On the Restoration of Guangwu" begins with these sentences: "Who in the world does not want to restore the country? But is restoration not difficult? However, Guangwu is very wrong..." He is also concerned about Eastern and Western cultures, so he also understands English. In his letters to his wife, the salutations are a combination of Chinese and Western styles: "My dear Waifu... You's Husband Pu Yi." Not only does he understand English, but he also knows rhyme. Please see his "Peach Blossom Palace Poem": "Peach Blossom Palace, Peach Blossom Courtyard, a peach blossom fairy lives in the Peach Blossom Courtyard, a peach blossom face, a peach blossom face, peach blossom scabies grow on the peach blossom face." What is even more important is that the talents he recruited included both new and old. Not only did Zheng Xiaoxu revise his papers for him, but Hu Shih, the dean of the Faculty of Arts of Peking University, was also often met. Therefore, Dr. Hu's business card is still in a glass frame, with a line of neat small characters written on it: "I have something to do today and cannot visit the palace." From this, we can know what kind of person Pu Yi is and to what extent his knowledge is. We can only pity his ignorance for his actions. Later, he even became a puppet, which is a manifestation of his ignorance.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Cold Mouth Ballad <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Clear and Gaunt</p>
<p>Cold Mouth is the center of today's battlefield, but its location has no verifiable record in ancient times. According to the Unified Gazetteer, during the Tang Dynasty, the Khitan soldiers were defeated and used the Cold Hinge to defend themselves. During the Song Dynasty, the Jin people exiled Hong Hao to Cold Mountain. Could this be Cold Mouth? I heard that there was a woman on the front lines who presented a white blade to the enemy. Slender jade hands, shimmering sword light, red blood and white snow flying in the air, presenting a unique, splendid, tragic scene. Looking out at the rivers and mountains, my heart is on the verge of breaking, so I compose this poem:</p>
<p>I have heard of resisting enemies with guns, not knives, and if resisting with knives, the enemy cries out in alarm. A woman roars with arms bared, like an angry tiger. The sound of killing rises everywhere, and all are heroes. The enemy faces it, the enemy's soul breaks, cowering in heaven and earth with nowhere to flee, falling to the ground and bowing a hundred times, the sound almost swallowed. Jade hands chop the neck, but the knife leaves no mark. In an instant, the sword light rises like fire, and the icy world begins to clear. The military spirit soars, washing away the enemy's aura, slicing open the enemy's liver, dismembering the enemy's body, separating the enemy's intestines, sucking the enemy's marrow. Why was the enemy so brave yesterday and so weak today? Now I know that the Wokou's military strength is great, but please try my sword. Otherwise, what will be the end of the enemy's forces!</p>
<p>Before Cold Mouth, who goes to battle? The sound of cannons is like a warning. Outside Cold Mouth, the enemy throws bombs endlessly. Cold Mouth freezes into ice flowers, and the sand and grass are covered in morning glow. The wind at Cold Mouth is like a tiger, the sword light whirling like snow, swallowing grease in a dance. One slash takes off the head, another slash hits the ground like a severed foot. At that moment, I hate not eating their flesh, drawing the knife across and stabbing their belly, kneeling before me is only shameful. Writhing in death, there is no crying allowed, collect the canine teeth and clothe them in blood, how tragic, the four limbs all cramped and shrunken. I hope the battlefield will be quickly recovered, so the enemy may finally close their eyes in peace. Red snow flowers cover the fields around Cold Mouth, in later years they will all tell of the great sword's merits.</p>

<p>Chapter Three: Finally Bearing the Heart to Untie the Bell, Entering the Door with a Clang, Secretly Pitying the Young Girl's Hair Bun, Sharing Food with Compassion</p>
<p>The weather turned cold again, with gloomy clouds, and one or two flakes of snow floated almost imperceptibly in the air. His hand, stretched out to hold the wire handle of the bucket, had turned as red as a carrot. He had thought about throwing the water out, but he had already walked this far, and it would be a pity to waste the water. If he carried the water back, not only would he not have enough strength, but stretching out his arm would be too painful from the cold. Just as he was hesitating in his heart, not knowing what to do, Zhao Ziqiang happened to be walking towards him from behind, carrying a large string of beef in his hand. Seeing him resting a bucket of water on the side of the road, his neck red, staring at the water in a daze, he stopped and asked, "Young lady, can't you carry it?" Gui Zhi said, "Isn't that right? The good water carrier went on strike again, I really don't know what to do." Zhao Ziqiang stepped forward, reached out and lifted the bucket handle, straightened his back, and quickly carried it into the gate. Gui Zhi followed behind, almost unable to keep up. Zhao Ziqiang carried it to the doorway, waited for Gui Zhi to come in, and said to him with a smile, "Young lady, where should I pour this water? I'll carry it with you." Gui Zhi then said, "Thank you so much, how can I ask you to carry it again?" Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said, "It's okay, we're neighbors, we help each other. If your household has no one to carry water or deliver coal, leave it to me. If our old man's clothes lose a button or his shoes break, then I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to do me a favor." Jiang Shi had heard them from inside the house and came out to greet them, saying, "Oh my! How can we let the company commander carry water for us?" Zhao Ziqiang laughed and said, "It's okay! What about the company commander, my hands weren't made of iron. Everyone has two hands, and these two hands can do things." As he spoke, he had already carried the bucket of water into the house, saw the water tank placed behind the door, and poured the water down with a loud splash. Jiang Shi said, "Thank you, thank you, if there's anything we can do for you in the future, Commander Zhao, please don't be shy, just tell us to do it!" Zhao Ziqiang smiled and went to the inner courtyard. Zhao Weng was holding a copy of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, reading by the fire under the snowy window. Seeing Zhao Ziqiang carrying a large string of beef in, he stood up with a smile and said, "Why did you buy so much beef again? I haven't finished the mutton I bought yesterday yet." (30)</p>

<p>Jiangnan is truly a beautiful landscape. Look at the peach blossoms in March, which adorn the beautiful rivers and mountains, enticing people to become intoxicated and infatuated by them. Poets ponder them, painters sketch them, travelers carry their cameras to photograph them, and literati spread paper and dip ink to write their biographies. The frivolous peach blossoms possess such magic power.</p>
<p>In the end, are people pursuing peach blossoms, or are peach blossoms luring people? If I were a judge and both parties brought their case before me, I would definitely and unhesitatingly judge: "The opening of peach blossoms is for the struggle for life. Human appreciation is actually a sign of covetous ambition. In the future, all appreciation of peach blossoms will be prohibited." Such a judgment is neither arbitrary nor biased. Because to protect the weak nation and restrain the strong's ambition, it must be done this way.</p>
<p>In these years, flamboyant peach blossoms cannot heal the pain of lost land or save the tragedy of national subjugation. What do we appreciate about them? If we have the leisure and interest to appreciate peach blossoms, why not go to Guanwai (outside the Great Wall) to appreciate the blood flowers of soldiers, which can also arouse common hatred and inspire the heart to kill the enemy. From Jiu Men in the east to Gubei in the west, outside the Great Wall is full of iron cavalry. They have new-style killing weapons, and we only have flesh bombs of loyalty and patriotism. These many flesh bombs, carrying broadswords and bare-chested, advance, advance, advance in the smoke and flames; kill, kill, kill in the rain of bullets. The enemy truly collapses at the mere sight, and our flesh bombs also die for righteousness. The result is that many peach blossoms made of blood are sprinkled on the desolate yellow sand and the white snowy mountains. Are the peach blossoms in Jiangnan good? Are the peach blossoms on the edge of the Great Wall good? Please go and appreciate them. I remember there were two lines of poetry in the past: "Peach blossoms behind the horse and snow in front of the horse, how can one not look back?" This kind of poetry is too decadent! It makes people too short of breath! Now I will change it a bit: "Peach blossoms behind the horse and blood in front of the horse, how can peach blossoms compare to blood flowers' redness?" Compatriots, don't be greedy for the peach blossoms of Jiangnan, quickly go and appreciate the blood flowers outside Guanwai.</p>

<h3 id="e200">The Most Artistic Country <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— He Jiagan</p>
<p>Our China's greatest, most enduring, and most widespread "art" is men dressing as women. The preciousness of this art lies in its being two-faced, or what is called "the Doctrine of the Mean." Men see "dressing as women," and women see "men dressing." On the surface, it is neutral, but in its bones, it is of course still male. However, if it doesn't dress up, will it become art? For example, China's inherent culture is the imperial examination system, plus the purchase of official titles. At first, it was said that this was too unlike democracy and did not conform to the trends of the times, so it dressed up as the Republic of China. However, this Republic has been in disrepair for a long time, and even the signboard has been peeled off, like the rouge on a female performer's face. At the same time, the honest masses truly want to start a government, but they actually want to abolish the political power of those who came from the imperial examination and those who purchased official titles. This is disloyal to the nation and unfilial to the ancestors, and it is extremely reactionary. Now that we have long returned to the "trend of the times" of restoring our inherent culture, how can we allow such disloyalty and unfilial piety? Therefore, we must dress up once again. The draft is as follows: First, whoever has the qualifications to represent the people must be decided by examination. Second, after the successful candidates are selected, they will be selected again. This is called selecting (verb) the successful candidates; and the successful candidates who are selected will naturally be the elected people. According to grammar, the electors of such a National Assembly should be called "those who elect," and the elected people should be called "the selected successful candidates." But, if it doesn't dress up, will it become art? Therefore, they must dress up as the electors and those who are elected in a constitutional country, even though in essence they are still scholars and successful candidates. The deep meaning of this draft lies here: to let the masses see democracy, and to let the nation's ancestors see loyalty and filial piety; loyalty to the inherent imperial examination system, and filial piety to the ancestors who established the imperial examination system. In addition, the democracy that has already been realized in Shanghai is that only those who pay taxes have the right to elect and be elected, so that only 4,465 large citizens are left in vast Shanghai. This is like the purchase of official titles — those with money are the masters, but they will definitely pass the imperial examination, and even if they don't take a supplementary exam, they will be granted the title of "Successful Candidate," because the example under the foreign masters should be followed, not to mention that this is also one side that does not violate the inherent culture, while at the same time dressing up very much like constitutional democracy. This is one.</p>
<p>Secondly, negotiating while resisting: looking at it from this side, it is resistance, but looking at it from that side, it is actually negotiation. Thirdly, on the one hand, being industrialists and bankers, and on the other hand, claiming to be "just a little poor." Fourthly, on the one hand, the sales of Japanese goods are booming again, and on the other hand, telling people that it is "National Goods Year"… There are countless such examples, and most of them are performed very skillfully, with both sides being smooth.</p>
<p>Ah, China is truly the most artistic country and the most moderate nation.</p>
<p>However, the common people are still dissatisfied. Alas, the moderation of the gentleman is the opposite of the moderation of the petty man!</p>
<h3 id="e201">White Russian <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>I left the house, walked through a narrow, dark alley, and arrived at Avenue Joffre. A person came towards me and took off his hat. It was a White Russian.</p>
<p>I knew him. He was doing a job similar to begging on this road. Every day I walked on this road, I had to see him, and he always had to take off his hat to me.</p>
<p>I didn't know his surname or given name, just as he didn't know me. I couldn't ask him in Russian, and he couldn't beg me in Chinese. On the surface, he and I were completely estranged.</p>
<p>But in our hearts, we had many things in common. Every time he saw me and took off his hat, he always smiled at me. This smile contained bitterness. From this smile, I could see his past extravagance and his current plight.</p>
<p>However, I never gave him anything, because I didn't know if giving to a Russian beggar was the same as giving to a Chinese beggar. So sometimes, even though I had pockets full of money, I always hesitated to take it out. I don't know when, I suddenly had the idea of pitying him. At that time, he was smiling at me, holding the hat he had taken off in one hand, and extending his thumb and little finger, placing them beside his mouth. I suddenly woke up and couldn't help asking him:</p>
<p>"Do you want to smoke?"</p>
<p>He didn't seem to understand me, and nodded subconsciously, still smiling. I started leading him to the front of a cigarette paper store, spent ten cents, and bought him a pack of "Wuhua Brand" cigarettes. He took it, his lips moved, his eyes staring at me blankly, his eyes full of gratitude.</p>
<p>After that, it became a routine. Every day when he saw me, he would always put his thumb and little finger beside his mouth; and I would always have to spend ten cents to buy him a pack of "Wuhua Brand" cigarettes.</p>
<p>But my financial resources were limited after all. As the days went by, I couldn't even afford to supply him with a pack of "Wuhua Brand" cigarettes every day. Today, I met him again on Avenue Joffre, this foreign friend (I prefer to call him a friend, and I don't want to have a gentleman-like friend). He was still smiling, taking off his hat, and putting his thumb and little finger beside his mouth; but I finally steeled myself and patted my pocket to show him that I no longer had the power to continue supplying him. His face suddenly became dejected, and he shook the hand that was originally placed beside his mouth, and walked away silently and sadly.</p>
<p>Looking at his back, all the humble lives and pitiful situations of the weak rushed to my heart, making my soul hurt as if it were injured. I felt that even that shaking hand of his carried his kind soul and kind heart. I repented, but he had already gone far away.</p>
<p>Suddenly a question rushed into my brain: "Living in my current national environment, how much difference is there between me and him in the eyes of the strong?"</p>
<p>A newspaper boy came walking towards me, shouting loudly the news of the loss of Jehol.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Women of Tibet <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhi</p>
<p>In today's world where monogamy is prevalent, polyandry is still practiced in Tibet. The reason why this unreasonable marriage system has survived to this day, of course, has its own reasons. Summarizing the general opinion, there are roughly two reasons for the prevalence of polyandry in Tibet. Some people say that there are fewer women than men in the Tibetan population, and because there are not enough to distribute, they have to adopt this system. In fact, Tibet has neither household registration surveys nor population statistics, so how can one say whether there are more or fewer men or women? This is probably just a speculation by some travelers or sociologists from various European and American countries. Others say that the reason for the prevalence of polyandry in Tibet lies in economic relations. Because resources are scarce and production is difficult in the region, it is not easy to accumulate wealth. Wealthy families, in order to preserve their ancestral property, have to strive for unity, so there are often five or six brothers who marry one wife together. Conversely, poor families can marry one wife per person. This statement seems to be more in line with the facts than the former.</p>
<p>The women of Tibet can be divided into two parts: urban women and rural women. The main tasks of rural women are farming, herding, collecting firewood, and transporting goods. They do not apply powder or makeup, and they bury themselves in hard work all day long, appearing strong and ugly, with brown-black skin, but they are extremely simple. Urban women are very different. Let's take the situation in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, as an example. The women of Lhasa can be divided into four classes: First, aristocratic women. They have beautiful looks and graceful manners, are skilled in singing and dancing, and are also very lively. Their jewelry is all made of gold, jade, coral, and pearls, and their makeup is the most extravagant. Second, middle-class women. They run small businesses, open small shops, and sell silk, cloth, and sundries. When they do business, they are good at telling false prices, and they also use warm emotions to intoxicate customers, so it is easy to sell their goods at good prices. Third, lower-class women. Tibet has private prostitutes who engage in flesh trade, but there are no public brothels. Some young women from ordinary families, because their wedding date is approaching and they have not yet secured the funds for their dowry, do not hesitate to sell their bodies to exchange money to prepare their dowry. This is truly a strange custom. Fourth, nuns. In general families in Lhasa, if there are two or more daughters, they must choose one to shave her head and become a nun, sending her to a nunnery to practice hard for the rest of her life, and women who become nuns seem to be quite willing.</p>
<h3 id="e203">"Midnight" and National Goods Year <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Le Wen</p>
<p>It is said that this year is National Goods Year. However, this year, Mao Dun's "Midnight" appeared.</p>
<p>Wu Sunfu, the King of National Goods in "Midnight" — or the one who attempts to be the King of National Goods — "He has the great ambition to develop national industry. He has always opposed people like Du Zhuzhai, who own large amounts of capital and specialize in land, gold, and public bonds; but now he himself is also immersed in public bonds!" Of course, national goods can "save the country," and it is said that public bonds can also "save the country." But what kind of saving the country is this? For example, the King of Public Bonds, Old Zhao, the King of Silver and Money, in "Midnight" is more powerful than him. The problem is very simple: to save the country, one must first manage the family, and to manage the family, one must first cultivate oneself. Confucius had already said this order of governing the country and pacifying the world. For these various "Kings," the first thing is to have profits, direct and indirect exploitation of surplus value, for their "cultivation." Whoever is good at "cultivating" has the qualification to "save the country." Public bonds and so on have this effect, so naturally they have to be immersed in public bonds. This is naturally not because of the size of the ambition. So national goods are unlucky. "It is a nominally Sino-foreign joint venture, but the Chinese shareholders are honestly brokers at heart! Old Zhao is just a broker, isn't he?" In fact, it's not just Sino-foreign joint ventures; even the factories that are completely nominally national merchants may be owned by foreign capitalists behind the scenes, such as Zhou Zhongwei, the "Old Man" of the match factory in "Midnight." (This year it's even fresher: some Chinese merchant factories have actually become factories for repackaging and repackaging Japanese goods.) Since national goods are unlucky, the King of National Goods, Wu Sunfu, has only the way out of surrendering, and he feels that "the way out of surrendering is much better than no way out!"</p>
<p>Okay, surrendering is decided. But is it surrendering to Old Zhao — the Old Zhao who "competes with Americans to start a company"? Old Zhao "colludes with foreign merchants to do mortgages for Chinese factories, then he is just a broker; if we have factories to transfer, can't we find the original account ourselves? Why should we rely on this broker!" The so-called original account — "there are two imaginary customers: a British foreign company and a Japanese company." This is not just a simple surrender issue. There are so many buyers to surrender to, and they are all top-notch bullies in the world, how can there be no reason for them to fight each other to the point of bloodshed. But these bullies are not stupid either; they each have their own little dogs, and first let the little dogs fight each other a few times to see which way the wind is blowing and compare their strengths. The time for them to directly open fire themselves has not yet arrived, but they first let China become a battlefield for "dogs." The situation is naturally very complicated, and the Chinese "people" naturally suffer all the hardships.</p>
<p>In "Midnight," most of these Chinese "people" are still under the deception, deception, and oppression of "dogs," but they are already fighting and resisting. Their weakness is not that they don't want to resist themselves, but that they are mostly not good at jumping out of all kinds of conspiracies of "dogs," and all kinds of indirect or indirect dog-inspired influences. For example, they clearly think it is already broad daylight even though it is still midnight, and even think that the sun is about to set, so they desperately hurry on, fearing that once night comes again, they will never see the light of day. Of course, not every "person" thinks this way. These are just some "people" rushing in front of the masses. The masses are learning in practice.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>After more than a quarter of an hour, most of the people attending had left. Li Yixiang was still laughing heartily, challenging Chen Huamin by raising many difficult questions to argue. This time, Haiquan felt a little uncomfortable. He thought that Chen Huamin's attitude was indeed a bit autocratic, but this was a responsible expression. And he didn't have any unnatural attitude. His ambition was only to work selflessly for the revolutionary cause. Li Yixiang seemed to be a little jealous of his exclusive control.</p>
<p>"Let's go…"</p>
<p>Li Yixiang puffed out his chest, swayed his body, walked to Haiquan, took his hand, and walked out.</p>
<p>"Old Chen, you are really a wild bird! You've got the route wrong!"</p>
<p>Li Yixiang said as he walked. His arrogant attitude seemed to be telling Chen Huamin, "Look, I have so many followers." Haiquan looked at Chen Huamin, who was just smiling foolishly, without saying a word.</p>
<p>Haiquan followed Yixiang out of the door of that foreign house. Yixiang stopped, and he stopped.</p>
<p>"What kind of place is this?"</p>
<p>Haiquan couldn't help but ask Yixiang first.</p>
<p>"A small inn run by White Russians."</p>
<p>After hearing this, Haiquan felt that Yixiang was more cheerful than Huamin and Yaoxing after all, and wouldn't be as secretive as they were, deliberately making things that didn't need to be secret secret.</p>
<p>"Why hasn't Mr. Chen left yet?"</p>
<p>When Yixiang heard Haiquan ask this, he laughed first, and after laughing for a while, he said:</p>
<p>"He and Atang are probably going to sleep in this house tonight. There's this inside."</p>
<p>As he said this, Yixiang stretched out his little finger for Haiquan to see. Haiquan understood and nodded. He suddenly heard someone yawning again. Looking in that direction, a policeman was still standing under the wall diagonally opposite.</p>
<p>"Why isn't the policeman paying any attention to us?"</p>
<p>"He just thinks we're clients, you know."</p>
<p>"But there are too many people, doesn't he suspect anything?"</p>
<p>"Not too many. This is very common. White Russian women have retail sales, they don't necessarily have to stay all night. Ha, ha."</p>
<p>They took a few steps in the dim light.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, do you want to be an important member of the S Society?"</p>
<p>"…"</p>

<p>Overseas Silver Prices and Exchange Rates Both Fall, Producing a High Price of 1100 Yuan - Central Bullish Sentiment Emerges Before Closing, but Sees a Fall of 11.9 Yuan</p>
<p>Although the gold market was only open for half a day yesterday, its changes were extremely rapid, with prices first rising and then falling in a very volatile process. Initially, foreign dispatches indicated that London's major silver contracts for both near and far terms were down 1.875, New York silver prices were down a small 0.25, far term silver market fell over 0.3 percent, Anglo-American exchange rates fell 1.125 points, American-British also fell a small 1.3125 points, bank private dispatches fell 3.125 points, and American cotton also fell a small 0.6 pound. Therefore, raw transactions immediately jumped, once reaching 1100 yuan and slightly declining, with the opening price at 1096 yuan. The exchange market opened tight, so the initial fluctuations were not significant, but the trend seemed stable. Later, due to Mitsui eating in July U.S. dollars at 0.95 yuan, market sentiment was extremely good, and prices immediately rose to 1100 yuan, which was a new high. However, the exchange market did not have better transactions, and those making sell-offs gradually retreated. The HSBC official exchange rate revealed first a small 0.25 for the pound, and a small 0.375 for the U.S. dollar, slightly pulling up. However, banks tended to become congested, and Sino-French came out with July U.S. dollars at 0.95625 yuan, still in a downstream shape. However, at this time, banks occasionally conducted offsetting transactions, so the process was still even. When Banque Franco-Chinoise (Hua Bi) sold July U.S. dollars at 0.96875 yuan and broke the 90 yuan barrier, it was unexpected that once this barrier was broken, the sharp decline became even more severe. Da De Cheng, Da Xing Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, and others aggressively sold off, coming on strong. Gold prices could not withstand it and retreated step by step. Rumors spread in the market about the Central Bank releasing bullish positions and various deteriorating situations, causing panic and a rapid decline in prices. The exchange market also became very firm, and because banks were willing to sell July U.S. dollars at 0.98125 yuan, breaking the 80 yuan barrier, Fu Chang sold even more, leading to a fall to 1075 yuan, a decrease of 25 yuan from the highest price. The declining trend gradually stopped, and those buying in at low prices seemed to surge, so the closing price at noon was 1077.5 yuan. Upon investigation, the market situation during the half-day rose and fell again, mainly because the Central Bank aggressively sold U.S. dollars. Spot red also changed lower to an additional 0.75 yuan and 0.5 yuan, and the swap premium was reduced to 15.5 yuan and 12.5 yuan. The market situation during the half-day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1096 yuan, an increase of 6.6 yuan compared to the previous close. Commodity opened at 6.5 yuan. The exchange market opened with the pound at 1 shilling, 8 pence, 0.1875, tighter by 0.125 compared to the previous close, and the U.S. dollar at 0.88125 yuan, tighter by 0.1875 compared to the previous close. Fu Chang first sold bars, retreating from 6.8 yuan to 5.2 yuan. Heng Xing placed a limit order to buy, and was held back. Shunli Run Chang Yu further went up to around 7 yuan, Zhi Feng Yong advanced to 7.5 yuan, Yuan Mao Yong came to sell and retreated to 6 yuan. After this, a sharp upward trend was seen. Zhi Feng Yong continued to purchase bars, still at over 7 yuan. Mitsui bought into July U.S. dollars at 0.95 yuan, and Fu Chang suddenly advanced to 8 yuan. Heng Yu and Fu Yu both took it, and the buying sentiment was strong for a time, immediately rising to a new high of 1100 yuan. However, this barrier was difficult to break through. Yuan Mao Yong sold off to within 9 yuan, and Yi Feng Yong even sold to 8 yuan. Yuan Heng Hong Li also sold at even lower prices. Sino-French first blocked July U.S. dollars at 0.95 yuan, and June U.S. dollars at 0.25. Yuan Chun came up to sell off within 7 yuan. Sino-French again blocked July U.S. dollars at 0.5625, and Hua Bi also issued May at 0.9 yuan. Fu Yu and Heng Yu both came to sell, falling to 5.8 yuan. The HSBC official exchange rate revealed first a small 0.25 for the pound, and a small 0.375 for the U.S. dollar. Shen Kang advanced to 7.8 yuan. Zhi Feng Yong suddenly came to sell off, and Heng Xing and Heng Yu also sold July U.S. dollars at 0.5625. Banks were willing to issue. Yuan Sheng Yong sold off with a limit down to 4.5 yuan. HSBC ate May U.S. dollars (丨) 0.625 and rose to 5.8 yuan, but because McCargar came out with June U.S. dollars at 0.3125, it still retreated to around 4 yuan. Yuan Heng and others took bars, showing a slight rebound. When Citibank came out with June U.S. dollars at 0.3125, it retreated to within 4 yuan. After this, a sharp downward trend was seen, and the declining wind suddenly rose. Da De Cheng sold off, and Qian Chang Xiang also issued. Sino-French blocked July U.S. dollars at 0.625. Da De Cheng even sold to 1.5 yuan. Heng Xing came to buy, rising to 2.5 yuan. August U.S. dollars at 0.9375 could be settled. Da Xing Yong aggressively sold off, retreating to within 1 yuan. Hua Bi came out with July U.S. dollars at 0.6875. The exchange market had firmed up. Da De Cheng sold bars, breaking the 90 yuan barrier. Zhao Feng Chang even sold to 88 yuan. Yuan Sheng Yong Da Xing Yong sold to within 7 yuan. For a time, selling sentiment permeated. Qian Chang Xiang Da Xing Yong competed to sell, reaching 83 yuan. Retail investors covered short positions, pulling up over 1 yuan. However, there were rumors that Cheng Feng Yong was selling off. It was even rumored in the market that the Central Bank would sell off bullish positions. People were extremely panicked. In addition, Da De Cheng Qian Chang Xiang Zhi Feng Yong competed to sell, breaking the 80 yuan barrier again. At this time, the exchange market was very firm. Banks were willing to issue July U.S. dollars at 0.98125 yuan. Fu Chang also sold, and for a time, buyers disappeared. The injury decline was even worse. Rumors in the market flew and crashed 25 yuan, falling to 1075 yuan. The selling wind stopped slightly. The speed of the change was truly unexpected. Heng Yu bought in bars, and retail investors covered short positions en masse, rising by 3 yuan. Before long, the noon closing was 1077.5 yuan. After the closing, Heng Xing and others continued to take it in, gradually rising again to over 80 yuan. Commodity first sold at 78 yuan. In the afternoon, there was a Saturday rest. Upon investigation, the highest price for this half-day was 1100 yuan, and the lowest price was 1075 yuan, a fall of 25 yuan. As a result, it fell 11.9 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>Because the HSBC official exchange rate was a small 0.375 for the U.S. dollar at 0.85 yuan, the gold price was revealed to be 1169 yuan. According to the closing price, about 91 yuan was held back, 27 yuan more than the previous close. The registration price for this month was 1092 yuan, and for May, 1078 yuan. The morning margin call was 1090 yuan.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market showed sellers extremely excited. In summary, Da De Cheng, Da Xing Yong, Fu Chang, Yuan Mao Yong, Yi Yong, Yuan Sheng Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Zhao Feng Chang, etc., all issued. Heng Xing, Zhi Feng Yong, Shen Kang, Heng Yu, Fu Yu, Yuan Xin Yong Chun Yuan Yong, etc., all bought in. There were not many transactions from the Dalian gang. The Guang gang slightly took in May bars, totaling 18,571 bars.</p>
<p>The spot premium was still low. The market counted an additional 0.75 yuan, which was taken in by Da De Cheng. After Tong Feng Heng and others took in 0.7 yuan, Da De Cheng took in another 0.6 yuan. The market situation was chaotic. The foreign gang sold to Ying Feng Heng at 0.5 yuan, still rising and falling with the swap premium.</p>
<p>The swap premium for April and May was low. Spot firms dropped out one after another. Qian Chang Xiang (Tai Kang Run) first posted in 15.5 yuan, which was posted by Yong Feng. 70 bars were counted. Ying Feng Heng reduced the price and was willing to drop, making it even cheaper. Fu Tai Heng posted 14 yuan to Ying Feng Heng, resulting in 14 transactions. Fu Tai Heng posted another 35 bars, Xiang Feng 35 bars, Heng Xing 175 bars, Da Xing Yong 70 bars, and Fu Tai Heng another 35 bars. Rui Xing 35 bars were all posted in by Ying Feng Heng, reduced to 13 yuan. Heng posted 35 bars, and Fu Tai Heng 8 bars, which were also posted in by Ying Feng Heng for 12.5 yuan. Rui Xing even posted 105 bars to Da Feng Heng, and Heng Xing also posted 35 bars to Da Feng Heng, all for 13 yuan. As of the day before, there were still 5,768 bars remaining for April.</p>
<p>Official notes (April) 112 bars were released by Da De Cheng, 133 by Heng Yu, 56 each by Yong Feng and Ying Feng Heng, and 140 by Qian Chang Xiang. 343 were taken in by Tong Feng Heng, 63 by Run Chang Yong, 49 by Heng Xing, 35 by Run Chang Yu, and 7 by Zhi Feng Yong, for a total of 497 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Anglo-American Exchange Rates Initially Tight, Then Loose <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign dispatches indicated that London's major silver contracts for both near and far terms were down 1.875. The Anglo-American exchange rate fell 1.125 points, the American-British exchange rate fell a small 1.3125 points. Therefore, the near-term opening for the pound was 1 shilling, 8 pence, 0.1875, tighter by 0.125 compared to the previous close. New York silver prices also shrank 0.255, and the gold exchange's far-term silver prices fell a small 0.3 percent. Bank private dispatches also fell 3.125 points, and American cotton fell a small 0.6 pound. The opening for the U.S. dollar was 0.898125 yuan, tighter by 0.1875 compared to the previous close. It was flat after opening. Later, Mitsui bought into July U.S. dollars at 0.95 yuan, and the gold market rose sharply, but the exchange market still did not see any tighter transactions appear. When the gold market fell back, banks still tended to issue. Sino-French blocked July U.S. dollars at 0.95 yuan, and June at 0.25. Although the official exchange rate revealed by HSBC was a small 0.25 for the pound and a small 0.375 for the U.S. dollar, it was still flat at this time. It became looser later. July U.S. dollars at 0.95625 yuan, banks were willing to sell. The more it was done, the looser it became. Finally, banks were willing to issue July U.S. dollars at 0.98125 yuan, which was the loosest point.

<h3 id="e211">Securities and Public Bonds Severely Hit by Rumors <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>The Morning Market Saw a Strong Selling Trend and a Decline, While the Afternoon Market Saw Retail Investors Covering Short Positions and a Slight Rebound</p>
<p>The Final Bids Showed a Consistent Decline of 3-4 Jiao to 1.1 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw unexpected turmoil in public bonds. Although it was not a correction caused by several days of price increases, the market price was significantly affected. Since there would be a three-day Arbor Day holiday starting next week, the market would be closed for four days including the weekend. Most people were prepared to close out their positions to avoid risks. Therefore, the opening bids for each price in the morning session all slightly retreated by 3-4 jiao due to retail bullish investors selling off, and the situation was quite moderate. Salt tax bonds were relatively stable. Before the second session, many absurd rumors suddenly arose in the market, and those in the market who took advantage of the opportunity and blindly sold short surged temporarily, which was laughable. Moreover, large investors had small buyers, but the market price had been suppressed by over 1 yuan. Twenty-year financial short-term public bonds, which had not been traded for a long time in one session, suddenly began to be traded at a price of 58 yuan. It was heard that the bank had settled in 5 million, so it had to make a market price for settlement. In the afternoon opening, it was known that the above rumors were completely unfounded, and retail investors came to cover short positions again. Although the opening session dispatched short sellers to suppress the price by 6-7 jiao to confuse the market, the various gangs still had a strong appetite for buying. After this, various bonds consistently rose by 2-3 jiao to 6-7 jiao. At the close, in addition to scattered retail bullish and bearish investors slightly settling their positions, very few speculators and large investors entered or exited. The market price saw ups and downs of 3-4 jiao. Only salt tax bonds rose by 5-6 jiao, which was relatively large, and the situation was still stable. In the end, there was a consistent decline of 3-4 jiao to over 1.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was 12,582,000 yuan. The spot market was 7,000 yuan, and the futures market's unified salt tax accounted for over 4.3 million, troop reduction accounted for over 2 million, 19 customs duties accounted for over 2.3 million, 20 coupon 20 customs duties accounted for over 2.9 million, and the remainder ranged from tens of thousands to 4-500,000. Financial short-term only had 60,000 transactions.</p>

<p>The September Contract Will First Be Changed to Foreign Currency Denomination</p>

However, some people believe that the current talk of yarn mills stopping production is very prevalent, and the domestic sales are temporarily stimulated, but whether it can continue in the future is still a problem. Moreover, the inventory of base goods is still thick, so the outlook is low. In short, after falling for many days, buyers have obtained this good news, and a glimmer of hope has appeared in the market.</p>

<p>The cotton market was firm in the morning and flat in the afternoon. Although the trend was firm, the actual situation was also generally bland. Because the overseas cotton industry situation was very weak, there was a part of the strong bullish pull in this city due to the awareness that the inventory was too thin. Looking back at the world situation, there was fear that there would be no major upward force. In the current hovering situation, a drastic change in the future is inevitable, so a certain major investor has been selling a lot.</p>

<p>A telegram from New York on the 31st reported on the cotton market during the week, saying that current trading is limited and the market price is uneven. Therefore, the cotton exchange here continued to be in turmoil last week, awaiting the establishment of the farm relief legislation. When the price rises, it is tired every time it encounters old bulls settling and overseas cross-selling. When the price falls, there are also short covering and peer purchases. However, the general investment people, in view of the possibility of inflation management, still believe that value is not easy to stabilize. Buyers have no indication of following the price increase, and people in the industry are all waiting for the development of the relief case. The new cotton crop has slightly better progress. As for the cotton fields, opinions are still divided due to the current uncertain situation. It has been recently announced from Washington that the goods stored by the cooperative as a subsidiary guarantee for loan loans will be sold soon. At the same time, Federal Administration Director Moqin Zhao also announced that the liquidation of this batch of stockpiles will be completed in an orderly manner.</p>

<p>The price has been changed from 2 li and a half to 5 li, but it is also a trial run for one month. The market has seen an upsurge because foreign wheat and gold prices have both risen, and the northern Tianjin gangs have withdrawn recent spot flour, (this month's label flour can be directly withdrawn according to the standard,) and have also purchased recent and distant months, and the trend of the factories is guarding and not releasing, so the market form has seen an upsurge, especially this month can withdraw the current flour, which is even tighter. The closing price for April, June, August, etc., was up 1 fen, 2.5 for the largest, and up 1 fen for July. The subsequent form showed that the northern gang's appetite was very strong, and there was an image of building up clouds.</p>

In the afternoon, customers套出, and the price returned to flat.

The Fujian merchants handled over 2,000 bags, local merchants 700 bags, and trading firms allocated 3,000 to 4,000 bags to their own customers, hence the active sales in the market.

Until after 5:00 PM, the intense sounds of gunfire and artillery from Shimenzhai shook the mountains and valleys. The telephone line to Shimenzhai was cut off after 3:00 PM. While our troops were engaged in hand-to-hand combat, three enemy aircraft bombed and destroyed Haiyang Town again at 4:00 PM. One enemy aircraft also flew to Shenhebao, west of Haiyang, for reconnaissance. (Special dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>After our troops' unsuccessful counterattack near Linyu yesterday, by about 10:00 AM today, the enemy launched a fierce attack on our Shimenzhai position and the area near the Yashui River with over 3,000 troops of a new type of unit, and 14 aircraft took turns bombing repeatedly. The battalion of our regiment rushed to the rescue but was surrounded by the enemy. At this time, multiple aircraft from the enemy aircraft carrier in the sea also came to bomb, bombing the entire position until it was nearly flattened and destroyed by 2:00 PM. As of the time of dispatch, fighting was still ongoing. According to captured enemy wounded soldiers, the Shimenzhai area is defended by the 2nd Puppet Garrison Army, consisting of three brigades and six regiments, approximately 6,000 men, dressed like the Japanese army and mixed with many Japanese.

<p>The Seiyukai Hoped to Regain Power</p>
<p>Saito Government Urgently Needed to Maintain Domestic and Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>(Reuters, Tokyo, March 28) The Japanese Diet adjourned on March 25. Throughout the session, the friendly attitude between the government and the Seiyukai was evident. Now, rumors of a cabinet reshuffle are rampant. Some time ago, it was widely rumored that Prime Minister Saito and Seiyukai President Suzuki had reached an understanding: if the Seiyukai supported the passage of the 1933-34 budget, the current national unity cabinet would resign after the Diet adjourned and recommend the formation of a purely Seiyukai cabinet to replace it. The Seiyukai's friendly attitude during the Diet session was partly due to its hope of regaining power. Although this specific understanding is highly questionable, if the current cabinet resigns, the power to select its successor will largely be in the hands of Elder Saionji. It is said that the Seiyukai's recent opposition to Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations and its insistence on sticking to the end were for this reason. It is clear that the Seiyukai is doing everything it can to prepare for its return to power. When Seiyukai Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated on May 15 last year, the Seiyukai held an absolute majority in the House of Representatives. After this act of violence, it was necessary to form a strong and powerful national unity government to cope with the serious domestic and foreign situation. The Seiyukai now believes that the crisis has passed and a national unity government is no longer needed, so it believes that there is no reason not to take back power from Saito now. If the Seiyukai's words are to be believed, the national crisis has indeed disappeared, and a change of cabinet would be easy. However, outside observers believe that restoring a party-led government at this time would be extremely dangerous, perhaps even more so than the internal strife that led to the formation of the national unity government a year ago. There were many reasons why the Japanese people united last year, but the two greatest were the pressure from Geneva and the excitement over the Manchurian Incident. Now that Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, foreign condemnation is gradually fading away, and the development of Manchuria is largely settled, no longer as lively as before. Therefore, Japan's unity is likely to weaken. Moreover, taxes are surprisingly high, and the people bear unprecedented burdens and sacrifices. Therefore, the general opinion is that Japan still urgently needs a national unity government today. (Dentsu, Shizuoka, 2nd) Prime Minister Saito arrived at Shizuoka Station at 6:00 PM yesterday and entered the Daito Inn. At 9:00 AM this morning, he took a Shizuoka Prefectural Office car to Okitsu to visit Prince Saionji, reporting on the process of withdrawing from the League of Nations, the deliberations of the 64th Diet, and the recent political situation. The meeting lasted until 11:30 AM, exchanging important opinions for about two hours. At 1:40 PM, he left Shizuoka and returned to Tokyo at 4:55 PM.</p>

<p>Some Jewish Stores are Closed, Others Operate as Usual</p>
<p>A Picket is Shot and Killed Inside a Store</p>
<p>Hitler's Stormtroopers Execute the Store Owner's Son</p>
<p>Schleicher Announces That Anti-Jewish Actions Are No Longer Necessary</p>
<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 1st) Berlin's boycott of Jewish people has been poorly organized. Many Jewish stores remained open after the nationwide declaration of a boycott, even with anti-Jewish slogans posted on the windows. Business proceeded as usual inside. Most of the most prominent Jewish stores in Berlin have closed, but not all of the large Jewish stores in the suburbs have done so, and the owners have not yet been disturbed. Many large Jewish stores are now closed, leaving a large number of non-Jewish employees idle. Even these non-Jewish employees do not all agree with the boycott. Many people gather in front of the closed Jewish stores, discussing the matter animatedly, while brown-shirted comrades walk back and forth, posting slogans on the windows to indicate that these are Jewish stores. Today is the day of the National Socialist Party's grand demonstration. Swastika flags and imperial flags fly on Berlin's trams and streetcars, and military bands march through the streets, playing military and patriotic songs. The streets of the Kurfürstendamm are extremely crowded, and many businesses are closed, making the crowd even larger. The anti-Jewish movement on the Kurfürstendamm is very strict. Not only are leaflets posted outside Jewish businesses, but Jewish doctors' offices and other businesses are also being boycotted. What is particularly off-putting is that cameras are set up in front of Jewish businesses, and anyone seen leaving a Jewish business is photographed, so no one dares to patronize them. Today is Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, so many Jewish people are taking the opportunity to close their businesses. There have been no violent incidents in the Kurfürstendamm area. The train to Denmark today is carrying a large number of passengers, all Jewish people leaving the country. Hundreds of people disembarked in Copenhagen, but many others continued to other parts of Denmark.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Einstein's Savings Confiscated <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>(Havas, Berlin, 1st) The famous scientist Professor Albert Einstein has declared his resignation from the directorship of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics and the Prussian Academy of Arts. After Einstein's resignation, the Prussian Academy of Arts issued a statement saying, "We have learned from the newspapers that Einstein has been helping France and the United States spread propaganda, saying that Germany has committed atrocities against Jewish people. The Academy is deeply indignant. Einstein intends to renounce his German citizenship first, and then his Prussian citizenship, so the Academy has no regret for his resignation." After Einstein engaged in anti-German propaganda, his bank savings were seized, totaling 30,000 marks in securities and cash. The German government said that these savings were for treasonous purposes.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 1st) The only serious incident related to the nationwide anti-Jewish movement in Germany today occurred in Kiel. A picket was shot and killed in front of a furniture store. National Socialist stormtroopers immediately attacked the store, stormed inside, and arrested the store owner's son, who was said to be the shooter. After the man was taken into custody at the police station, National Socialists stormed the station and shot him to death. Jewish people who occasionally laughed at the boycott movement or made dissatisfied remarks on the street were arrested. Pickets are also monitoring many famous restaurants and businesses, which is surprising, as it was not previously known that they were Jewish-owned. Employees of Jewish stores gathered outside the store and joined National Socialists in a demonstration at the square outside the former imperial palace to protest what they called the "atrocity propaganda" launched by foreign Jewish people. National Socialists today went to a bank where the famous scientist Albert Einstein had savings, checked his account, and confiscated all of his securities worth 25,000 marks and 5,000 marks in cash. It is said that Einstein recently arrived in Antwerp, Belgium, from New York and declared that if Germany interfered with the freedom of thought of its people, he would never return to Germany.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Munich, 1st) General Schleicher, leader of the anti-Jewish movement, announced here tonight that, according to telegrams from overseas, there is no need to continue the boycott after April 5, next Wednesday. Therefore, the boycott will be limited to one day and will end nationwide tonight.</p>

<p>France Will Submit to Cabinet for Discussion</p>
<p>(Havas, Paris, 1st) This afternoon at 4:00 PM, British Ambassador to France Tyrrell visited Foreign Minister Boncour, with the aim of informing Boncour of the views expressed by the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary during their previous negotiations with the French authorities in Paris. After Tyrrell left, the Foreign Minister immediately reported the results of his conversation with Tyrrell to Prime Minister Daladier. French Ambassador to Rome Suvane has returned to Paris to report all news related to the situation to the authorities. The government, having understood the proposals of Britain and Italy, can now fully express its views. The cabinet meeting next week will almost certainly discuss this matter. This afternoon, Suvane spoke with Boncour for two hours. Suvane reported all the details of the recent negotiations between the British and Italian authorities in Rome to Boncour. The two then exchanged views on the negotiations in Rome and elsewhere.</p>
<p>(Havas, Paris, 1st) French Ambassador to Rome Suvane arrived in Paris at 9:50 AM this morning and paid a visit to Foreign Minister Boncour at 3:00 PM, speaking until 4:00 PM. British Ambassador Tyrrell arrived at that time, so they paused for half an hour, and then resumed the conversation until 5:00 PM. Suvane then went to the Ministry of War to meet with Prime Minister Daladier.</p>
<p>(Havas, Rome, 1st) Italian newspapers singled out the French press that supported Mussolini's plan, paying close attention to the return of French Ambassador to Italy Suvane to Paris. "Il Giornale d'Italia" stated that the French people are increasingly aware of the Italian plan. However, when mentioning the Romanian Foreign Minister in Paris, they said that France is seeking opinions from all parties at home and abroad. France cannot express its definite view until this work is completed.</p>
<p>(Havas, London, 1st) The Manchester Guardian said that those who support the revision of the peace treaty do not advocate engaging in revision outside the scope of the League of Nations. The newspaper considers this satisfactory. The greatest criticism of the 1919 peace treaty is that the signing of these treaties was forced. If the new treaty that replaces it is still forced, then why bother? Some countries are strongly opposed to revising the treaty, but if we can assure these countries that the revision of the treaty will still be discussed by the Geneva international organization and that all countries will receive peaceful treatment, then these countries may be willing to consider this issue. What France and the Little Entente countries oppose is the forced revision of the treaty. There will certainly be all kinds of great difficulties in achieving the goal of treaty revision, but if a definite proposal can be put forward, the atmosphere in all quarters can be expected to clear. Once the atmosphere is clear, the general public can see that the danger of those who advocate revision is not as great as those who oppose revision fear, and there is no so-called secret solidarity among the countries that advocate revision.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Singapore, March 28) The Chinese Chambers of Commerce in the Straits Settlements and Malaya have recently jointly petitioned the Singapore government and the Malayan government, appealing to allow overseas Chinese to grow rice to support their livelihoods. According to the current regulations in Malaya, only Malays are allowed to grow rice, in order to protect the Malay natives and prevent them from being competed against by other peoples, especially the Chinese, who are skilled at growing rice. However, local finances make it impossible for the government to implement any great plans, and Malay farmers are also in dire straits, with little opportunity for the expansion of private enterprises. Therefore, it is hoped that the Singapore government and the Malayan government will give careful consideration to the appeal of the Chinese Chambers of Commerce. Malaya currently imports over 500,000 tons of rice each year, worth 40 million yuan, and other food worth 2 million yuan.</p>

<p>According to the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun, the four naval personnel arrested last September for the red scare incident in the Japanese naval port have had their preliminary hearing at the military court concluded. All newspapers have also been released to publish the details simultaneously. This case involves Hengjiro Nishi, a third-class sailor on the warship Haruna, Yoshiji Yoshihara, a third-class sailor on the warship Nagato, and Takeshi Kawada, a third-class sailor on the warship Yamashiro, who were instructed by the Communist Party headquarters to carry out the red scare plan in Yokosuka Naval Port in January of last year. The plan involved using rest time to first instill communist ideas, and then organize red scare classes. By May of the same year, they used the summer vacation time to hold secret meetings at the home of the mastermind, carefully studying communism. In July, they went to Tokyo, where Mao Tanigawa, the Minister of Military Organization of the Communist Party, secretly provided red scare materials and planned the propaganda outline, in order to strengthen and expand it in the navy. In September, a theft suddenly occurred on the warship Haruna. During a strict inspection of the crew, Nishi, feeling guilty, hurriedly discarded all the red scare documents in a dustbin, where they were found. At the same time, evidence of contact between Kawada and Yoshihara was found in Nishi's letters. With this, the case was completely exposed. Since the incident, the naval authorities, in order to prevent the spread of red scare ideas, have conducted detailed investigations into the identities of naval soldiers.</p>
<h3 id="e253">The Fur Trade of Soviet Russia <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Currently Ranks Second in the World</p>
<p>TASS Moscow News In the old Russian era, Russia's fur trade was completely controlled by foreign merchants. They collected furs through plunder and uneconomical methods, so most animals were killed off, and some even became extinct. After the revolution, the Soviet government began to restore the fur trade, with remarkable results. The Fur Trust uses the complexity of the climate within the Soviet Union to cultivate various animals. Currently, the Fur Trust manages 140 rabbit farms and 30 wildcat farms. Dozens of farms cultivate animals such as white fox, silver fox, blue fox, sable, and silver sable. The number of artificially cultivated muskrat reaches ten thousand. The fur trade of the Soviet Union currently ranks second in the world, second only to the United States. In northern Soviet Union, such as Kamchatka and the Caucasus Mountains, where human traces are scarce, hunting work has gradually developed. In 1932, the Soviet Union had 40 "hunting stations," which have now increased to 80. The Soviet Union's fur industry has also been developing rapidly in recent years. In the old Russian era, the furs supplied to foreign merchants were all raw materials. Currently, half of them have been processed and dyed by Soviet factories, and many foreign merchants send their furs to Soviet factories for processing. In the last ten years, the Soviet Union has exported furs worth 850 million rubles. Furs account for a huge proportion of total exports, sometimes even reaching 12 percent. The current Soviet Union can be called an international fur market. Each year, when fur auctions are held in Leningrad, fur merchants from various countries come to participate.</p>

<h3 id="e256">The Quantity of Munitions Supplied by Britain to Japan <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>London Correspondence (March 1st)</p>
<p>At Geneva, the British representative, in voting on the Lytton Report, expressed support for the report in order to create the impression that Britain does not agree with Japan's actions in the Far East. In reality, the British government is simultaneously the supplier of munitions to Japan. British Foreign Minister Simon plays the role of peaceful arbitrator in Geneva, endorsing the proposal affirming that Japan is the aggressor. In London, the poison gas company in which Simon is a major shareholder is increasing shareholder dividends. In words, it supports peace, but in reality, it supports war. This is the British Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>It is impossible to point out the exact number of munitions shipped from Britain to Japan. The British government's trade statistics only record the figures for specifically licensed exports of military supplies. In 1929, Japan's total munitions imports from Britain accounted for 17.3 percent. In 1930, the percentage accounted for by Britain reached 30.5 percent. Subsequently, this percentage has increased significantly. The ratio of munitions shipped from Britain to Japan compared to munitions shipped to China is four to one. From this, it can also be seen that Britain favors Japan. British government trade statistics indicate that the quantity of machine guns and bullets shipped to Japan was particularly high from August 1931 to September 1932. From September 1931 to September 1932, approximately 10 million rounds of bullets and approximately 660 machine guns were openly shipped to Japan. In addition, there were many other military equipment. In 1932, a total of 13 million rounds of bullets and 800 machine guns were shipped to Japan. However, this is only the first batch of munitions ordered by the Japanese General Staff. The British munitions industry has become even more vigorous with the development of Japan's military in the Far East, processing and manufacturing day and night. In the last four months, the supply of machine guns alone has been sufficient to supply 54 brigades (at the same time, millions of bullets and auxiliary parts, etc., were shipped to Japan).</p>
<p>According to the "Daily Herald," a certain munitions factory has supplied Japan with 36 million rounds of bullets alone. Another munitions factory has supplied Japan with 1,000 machine guns. This was within eight weeks. Vickers-Armstrong, whose pre-war dividend was only 5 percent, now has a dividend that has increased to 25 percent. Recently, it has also obtained a contract to purchase munitions worth 30 million pounds. A large number of cannons were shipped to Japan not long ago, and now it continues to receive contracts to order a large number of 8.5-pound bombs. According to the "Sunday Express," Vickers-Armstrong is manufacturing for Japan 24 hours a day. To manufacture bomb caps, it has added 700 workers. The Newcastle factory shipped 30 tanks to Japan last November. Vickers-Armstrong-Conceal's Dartford factory is entirely manufacturing hand grenades for Japan.</p>
<p>Finally, it is particularly noteworthy that Japan has been buying ships in Britain. In the last three years, Japan has purchased 76 old ships in Britain, totaling 500,000 tons. Most of these transactions were completed in the second half of last year. Two of them were relatively large, with a maximum draft of 45,000 tons. During the Great War, these British ships were used as transport ships, hospital ships, and armed merchant ships. Japan is also buying ships in the Netherlands, Norway, and Belgium.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the correct number of munitions shipped from Britain to Japan cannot be obtained from British trade statistics. British munitions factories have their own private methods for selling munitions. The "Sunday Express" claims that many of the munitions supplied by Britain to the Japanese government are shipped through Siam. A large portion of the munitions used on the front lines are shipped directly to certain locations without passing through Japanese seaports.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the munitions that British industry supplies to Japan has reached a level that can no longer be kept secret.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Japan's Preparation for Total War Mobilization (Japan News) <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Scientific Pictorial Publishing House held a symposium on national total mobilization. The attendees were all figures from the Ministry of the Army, such as Yoshio Uetsuki, Chief of the Control Section of the Preparation Bureau; Shizudo Yatari, staff member; Seiichi Yamada of the Mobilization Section of the Preparation Bureau; and Hageo Tanihana, Xiong from the News Class. What they discussed was extremely important. Here is a summary translation, which should clarify the recent preparations for war in Japan.</p>
<p>1.  The Future War's Character - Total Mobilization</p>
<p>Needless to say, we all know what the future war will become. Everything is evolving, and war has also evolved greatly from ancient times to the present. In the primitive era, the main body of war was roughly centered on one person or one tribe. However, as society gradually evolved, the main body of war also gradually expanded to nations, tribes, cities, or countries. Also, ancient wars were limited to a portion of the nation, especially a few people advocating the use of force to fight, so the end of the war was attributed to the defeat of the central figure, the extinction of a tribe, or the defeat of an armed group of a tribe, city, or country. However, since the Franco-Prussian War in 1870-1873, a state of evolution has been particularly evident. The French army was almost completely destroyed by the German army. Although the field army was defeated, Gambetta later gathered a force of volunteers, said to be 2.5 million strong. This shows that even if the field army is defeated in this era, the nation can still fight if it still has a strong will to continue the war. Later, although the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War also occurred, they cannot be considered thorough wars, and can be said to have ended halfway. Therefore, the so-called national war form was not demonstrated. If Japan had been defeated at that time, it would have certainly gathered volunteers again to continue the national final battle. As for the World War, needless to say, almost all of Europe participated in the state of war. Its evolutionary footprint has history as evidence. In the primitive era, war was a one-on-one state, but because of the evolution of society, war gradually became various forms. The Franco-Prussian War can be said to be a war of the whole nation, and the World War can be said to be a war of national power. If there is another war in the future, I think that this future war has a very close relationship with all the politics, economy, transportation, and transportation of the world, so the occurrence of war is more like a military war between several countries or a complex war between one country against several countries, rather than the state of a military war between one country against one country like the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. From this point of view, in the future war, both</p>
<p>The number of soldiers used should be increased compared to past battles, so the need for military supplies should also increase. And, as I said earlier, the method of engagement has also greatly changed, and finally became the so-called war of national power. So, when two countries fight, eliminating the enemy country's will to continue the war is also counted in the tactics. Then, if you want to eliminate the enemy country's will to continue the war, what method should you use? There are many methods. To give one or two examples, using propaganda to eliminate the army's or the nation's belief in victory is also a method. Also, the front plane is very developed. A plane can transport a ton of bombs from a distance and drop them on Tokyo, the political center, or Nagoya, the economic and industrial center, or the Kitakyushu area. This is another method, or use aircraft to bomb industrial cities to destroy their resources. This planned destruction of resources is also a method of engagement. Other methods, such as the starvation policy or economic blockade adopted by Germany against Britain, should also be considered important means of engagement. Recently, a certain country (referring to the Soviet Union) has even issued the statement that there will be no front lines in future wars. In reality, when fighting, bullets will be used, so a war without front lines is impossible. However, a certain country's methods of engagement are like this: on the one hand, fighting on the front line, while expanding the battle line from the rear of the front line to the colonies and within the enemy country, using various methods to eliminate its military force or guide its revolution. It is true that a certain country may be able to adopt such methods of engagement. From this point of view, the future war is no longer linear or planar, but three-dimensional, and the geographical area has expanded from the battlefield to the country. Regarding the equipment of the troops, during the World War, Germany used poison gas to attack secretly, causing the British army to be defeated. Conversely, Britain used tanks to attack the German army, endangering German territory. As such, weapons have made great progress from the war, and new weapons will inevitably be produced in response to the times. Moreover, these weapons will require a large number of iron. Recently, the tendency to use large amounts of poison gas materials has also been clearly demonstrated. If we look at the weapons that various countries are striving for, we can understand that they value the enrichment of aircraft, the development of chemical warfare aircraft, and the increase in the power of guns and cannons. Because to compensate for these, the knowledge of optics, electricity, and dense machinery has been used to the greatest extent in the research of weapons, and various automobiles are used to replace horses in mechanized corps. Such observations of the future war situation show that, from any perspective, a large amount of iron and a large amount of military supplies are needed. This is very obvious. During the two years of the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese army fired 1.05 million shells. In the Battle of Mukden, the Japanese army fired 330,000 shells in two weeks. However, in the Battle of the Marne in World War I, the French army fired one million shells in one week. The shells used by the Japanese army in two years of the Russo-Japanese War were fired clean by the French army in just one week. Also, in the Battle of Sulm, the French army used 20 million shells in two weeks, while the British army used 14 million shells. If we drop so much iron on the enemy's position, just thinking about these shells, where should these industries be manufactured during wartime? This question will inevitably arise immediately. The Japanese army only has arsenals. It is certainly impossible to produce a large quantity of things there, so it is inevitable to use civilian factories. This is just talking about bullets. However, clothing and food also require a huge quantity. Other things such as medical supplies and veterinary supplies also require a considerable quantity. It is ultimately impossible to manufacture these things in government-owned factories. Expanding the capacity at once cannot be done in a short period of time. Therefore, it is essential to use civilian factories. Other issues such as how to obtain raw materials and where to store the finished products, and how to transport them, and other issues will surely arise if you think about it. These problems should be solved in peacetime. It is impossible to prepare for them when the war breaks out, so we must prepare from peacetime. We call this plan for preparation military industry mobilization.</p>

<p>Children Are the Vitality of the Nation and the Life of the Chinese People</p>
<p>The city's third annual Children's Day is being jointly organized by the Municipal Education Bureau and other agencies. The commemoration is scheduled to take place the day after tomorrow (the 4th) with a large-scale celebration. This morning, the heads of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Hongen; Education Bureau, Pan Gongzhan; Health Bureau, Li Ting'an; and Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Xingya, issued a special announcement, stating: "This year, April 4th is the third Children's Day in our country. Our bureaus have jointly organized the Shanghai Children's Day Celebration Preparatory Committee with various agencies and social organizations in the city. It has been decided that a commemorative meeting will be held at the Penglai Grand Theater in the Nanshi area from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM on that morning, featuring various performances and games to entertain children from all over the city. We have also contacted shops in the city to offer special discounts on Children's Day, hospitals to provide free smallpox vaccinations for children, and parks to open specially on Children's Day, allowing children to enter and play for free. Major newspapers will also publish special editions on Children's Day. The reason for such emphasis on and preferential treatment of children is that children are the vitality of the nation and the life of the people. The adults of today were the children of the past, and the children of today will be the adults of the future. Children inherit the cause of adult society, continue to promote and create, maintain and advance the civilization of society. The responsibilities they bear are both heavy and significant. Adults should respect and cherish them. Our country is currently facing national difficulties, and most of the relief efforts rely on adults. However, to permanently eliminate foreign aggression and promote national glory, we must make every effort to protect the lives of children, ensure their well-being, strengthen their bodies, and develop their intelligence. This is essential to achieve lasting domestic stability and external security. Our bureaus are keenly aware of this, and we are happy to advocate and commemorate the Children's Day. A permanent organization for the welfare of children in the city has been planned by our bureaus and approved by the Children's Day Celebration Preparatory Committee of this year and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation."

<p>Mr. Zhang Qun, a member of the Central Committee, went to Beijing to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and consult with the Central Government on ways to reorganize the political affairs of Sichuan. He completed his official duties last night and took the night train back to Shanghai, arriving at the North Station around 8:00 AM this morning. He immediately returned home to rest. Regarding the ways to reorganize the political affairs of Sichuan, the Central Government has not yet fully determined the plans, and Sichuan Province is currently focused on suppressing bandits and has no time to discuss reorganization.

<h3 id="e265">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits a Petition to the Municipal Government to Expand Merchant Education in Pudong <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Requesting the Allocation of Incense Money from the Imperial Temple of Immeasurable Blessing</p>
<p>Using Superstitious Funds to Establish Schools</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "A petition is submitted regarding a request for a factual report. On March 31st, Xia Xinzhai, Director of the Pudong Branch of the association, reported that Pudong has a dense population and closed-off public sentiment. Commercial knowledge is infantile, and there are many illiterate laborers. The reason for this is that education has not been popularized. The only municipal junior high school in Pudong is limited by funding and is crude and simple. The school building has not yet been constructed, let alone expanded. On the west bank of the river, schools are densely packed, but the costs are high and beyond the means of small commercial classes in Pudong, resulting in an increasing number of young people out of school and more illiterate people. To popularize local education, it is necessary to allocate public funds to supplement the municipal treasury, which is insufficient. According to investigation, the annual incense money income of the Imperial Temple of Immeasurable Blessing in Pudong is approximately more than three thousand yuan. The temple management committee has been established for over two years, and the accumulated funds are considerable. However, how the funds are used is unknown. It is believed that this superstitious incense money is part of the local public fund income. If it can be allocated to local education, the public funds will not be wasted, and the local community will benefit greatly. Moreover, the development of education and the revitalization of commerce have a close relationship with each other. In this era of increasingly advanced global commercial warfare, if we look back at our country, it remains old-fashioned and closed off. There is an urgent need to increase the knowledge of merchants and popularize merchant education so that we can compete and survive. Otherwise, there is no way to save the situation. This is the humble opinion of the petitioner, and we dare to present a brief outline. We propose that your association forward a petition to the Municipal Government to approve the allocation of all annual incense money income from the Imperial Temple of Immeasurable Blessing to local education so that the commercial future will be greatly benefited." The association has investigated that the annual incense money income of the Imperial Temple of Immeasurable Blessing in Pudong is quite large. Although there is a management committee to manage the funds, the funds have not been used for the past two years and are stored in a useless place, which is a pity.

<p>Yesterday afternoon at approximately 2:00 PM, the flagship of the American Asiatic Fleet, the USS Houston, was entering the Huangpu River and preparing to drop anchor at Buoys 13 and 14 when a small French gunboat, the France-Chine, was passing by on its way to the Yangtze River. The current was very strong, and there was a strong south wind. As the American warship was moving, the French gunboat was pushed by the wind and collided with it, causing several cracks below the waterline in the middle of the ship. A portion of the deck and several lifeboats were also damaged. The ship immediately sent out a distress signal to Shanghai, and the tugboat Saint Dominic arrived to assist in pumping water to prevent it from sinking. Shortly after, the tugboats Victoria and Alexander also arrived and towed the gunboat to the Qiu Xin Shipyard.</p>

<h3 id="e268">Eleven Umbrella Factories, Including Huali, Xin Dalu, and Others, Suspended Operations Yesterday <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Small Businesses Formed a Forced Common Sales Market</p>
<p>Four Hundred Unemployed Workers Demand a Thorough Investigation by the Party and Government</p>
<p>Recently, small businesses in the city's umbrella industry have formed a common sales market, forcing the large companies, including Huali, Xin Dalu, Minhua, Senfeng, Litailai, Ruilin, Zhixin, Nanchang, Dongnan, Sanyuan, Dayouyu, and others, to participate, disrupting industry regulations. As a result, they all suspended operations yesterday morning, causing disputes. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Truth of the Dispute: According to Liu Quanru of Huali, there are more than 40 umbrella businesses, large and small, in the city. Recently, small businesses, including Huanqiu Yichang, Minhua Erchang, Minhua Song Erchang, Yingfeng Huamei Yichang, Huamei Erchang, Xin Zhen, Huazhen, Taidalun, Lixin, and others, formed a common sales market, forcing all factories to participate. The method is to send the goods to them, and they will issue checks. However, the checks are useless because they have no credit. The market deducts six cents per dozen as a commission for the fund. However, because the profit on umbrellas is low, only two yuan per dozen, it is practically impossible to do so. Moreover, according to the market rules, a fine of 200 yuan will be imposed for private sales of one dozen. Therefore, they had to suspend operations to save expenses.</p>
<p>The Union's Statement: According to Chuan Bichen, a member of the standing committee of the Umbrella Industry Union, the workers' wages in each factory are based on the quantity of goods shipped. They can only maintain their family life by working every day. Now, the factories are ignoring the livelihood of the workers and have suspended operations one after another, causing panic among more than 400 male and female workers. In order to protect the workers, the union petitioned the Municipal Party Department yesterday and scheduled to petition the Social Affairs Bureau tomorrow morning, requesting them to send personnel to investigate thoroughly and mediate as soon as possible to maintain the labor movement.</p>

<p>Due to frequent internal conflicts and foreign aggression in recent years, our country's rural economy is declining. If it is not rescued immediately, it will greatly affect the people's livelihood. Han Kou and other ports have already started handling the rescue. The financial and industrial circles in this city, in view of the importance of rescuing the rural economy, have held several informal meetings in recent days, and the results are quite good. It is reported that it has been decided to raise five million yuan first to establish a farmers' lending office (a type of bank) and then consider other rescue measures.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Accumulated Bandits Attempt to Escape Using a Human Pyramid <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced Severely After Being Captured</p>
<p>The accumulated bandit Zeng Fanji (nicknamed Da Jizi, previously mistaken for Xiao Jizi) has the skill of pretending to be sick. Every time he is captured, he uses his skill to escape the law. This time, Zeng and his accomplices, Zeng Chongshan, Zeng Zhixiang, Zhang A'er, Gu Shugen, Zhang Xiao Lizizi, and others, were captured by Chief Detective Lu Liankui, Detective Liu Shaokui, and others, and more than ten cases of armed robbery were found. The bandit again used the old trick of pretending to be sick. After being exposed, he and another thief, Wang Xingzi, were imprisoned in a cell to isolate them from their accomplices. Later, Da Jizi saw an opportunity to take advantage of the darkness and conspired with Wang to escape. They destroyed the windows of the prison and used a human pyramid, placing their feet on Wang's shoulders to escape through the window. However, the next day, he was still captured by Chief Detective Lu and others and sent to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation. At the end of the trial, the sentencing was scheduled for Saturday morning. The detectives in charge sent the bandits and the firearms, one pistol, and four bullets, to the First Special District Police Station. Lawyer Ru Bao Yi also appeared in court. Then, Judge Feng Shide took the seat and asked Zeng and others for their names and ages. He then announced the judgment. Zeng Fanji was sentenced to twelve years in prison for robbery and three years for escaping, to be served concurrently for a total of fourteen years. Zhang A'yi was sentenced to eleven years, Gu Shugen was sentenced to eight years, Zhang Xiao Jizi was sentenced to seven years, Zeng Chongshan and Zeng Zhixiang were each sentenced to two years and six months, and Wang Xingzi was sentenced to one year for helping to escape. The guns and bullets were confiscated.</p>

<p>Handed Over to the Japanese Consulate for Interrogation After Being Arrested</p>
<p>No. 74, Zhe Xing Li, Di Si Wei Road, which is located within the jurisdiction of the First Sub-bureau of the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau, is a Shi Ku Men building. Usually, many people enter and exit, and their actions at night are secretive and suspicious. After being secretly reported, Section Chief Liang Fuchu sent translator Li Wei Yuan to investigate secretly at 2:00 PM on the 29th of last month. He found that there were passwords for entering and exiting, and that there were many Koreans and Japanese. Their actions were indeed suspicious. After reporting the situation to the Section Chief, after consideration by Section Chief Liang, he convened a meeting of patrol officers and section members. At around 1:00 AM this morning, the Section Chief personally led patrol officer Chen Zuo Wu, section member Liu Guo Guang, translator Li Wei Yuan, detectives, and more than ten police officers to the area. First, the translator used a password to call at the door. After less than three minutes, the door opened. They poured in and searched the living room downstairs, finding one opium pipe, one opium lamp, one set of mahjong tiles, four red pills, one morphine needle, two packs of morphine, and one set each of Japanese playing cards and poker cards. A Japanese man named Sugimoto Yoshio said that Japanese people were not under the jurisdiction of the Chinese authorities and that the police station could not arrest people arbitrarily. The translator explained that anyone committing a crime in the Chinese district would be handled by the Chinese police station. After a long argument, the Section Chief sent someone to report to the Japanese Consulate, who ordered several Japanese police officers to accompany them to the scene. They were arrested together, including seven people: Koreans Liang Cheng Yuan, 33 years old, Shen Yong Qiu, 42 years old, Yin Bing Gao, 43 years old, Li Ji Cheng, Li Yuan Xue, 33 years old, Zhu Xi Ren, 35 years old, and Japanese Sugimoto Yoshio, 32 years old. They were all taken to the First Sub-bureau of the Fifth District. After preliminary interrogation by the Section Chief, Korean Liang Cheng Yuan admitted that he opened a brothel at No. 74 for people to smoke red pills and inject morphine. He did not deny it. The others were evasive. On the spot, the seven people and the evidence were handed over to the Japanese police to be taken back to the Japanese Consulate for handling. However, the second landlord, Cheng Guang Cai, 31 years old, from Nantong, was detained at the bureau because he had allowed foreigners to open a brothel inside. He was extremely unsupportive and was reported to the Public Security Bureau for review this morning.</p>

<h3 id="e275">Women's Liberation and Men's Liberation <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>The Chinese women's liberation movement has been around for at least twenty years now. The result of this movement is that a portion of women have gained considerable status in politics and society, which is indeed a welcome development!</p>
<p>So, are they truly liberated? No! Not completely! Even men have not yet achieved liberation, let alone women! All their liberation amounts to is cutting their hair, unbinding their feet, and adding a few rice bowls to their slender hands, or producing a few female committee members or county magistrates on the political stage. Other than that, there is simply nothing!</p>
<p>Since the forces of capitalist imperialism quickly stormed into the gates of the East, and the waves of the global economic panic crossed the East Sea and submerged the East Asian continent, China, the semi-colonial land whose blood and sweat have been completely squeezed dry, is filled with countless wounds and sores in its limbs and organs; the decline of the cities and the bankruptcy of the countryside all present a picture of ruin and decay. Under such circumstances, those "semi-liberated" Chinese women are running into walls everywhere. Indeed, they have been liberated, greatly liberated. Look, many of them are already able to be economically independent. However, the majority of them, like the majority of men, either have jobs but still cannot make a living, or are constantly threatened by the terror of unemployment; some are driven by life to live an inhuman existence of selling their souls, bodies, and labor. They have entered the same fate as men, wearing the same shackles. They, like men, have not been liberated! They have no bread or freedom, only suffering, oppression, hunger, and death!</p>
<p>One shackle has only been partially removed, but another shackle has been put on!</p>
<p>Some women who stand on the superstructure of society, in the special class, even turn around to oppress their toiling sisters and brothers. They have destroyed their own shackles, but they have locked others with even coarser and heavier shackles.</p>
<p>In short, the women's liberation movement of the present era is no longer an antagonistic movement between the two sexes, but rather an antagonistic movement between oppressed men and women uniting against capitalist imperialists and other oppressors. Therefore, the true women's liberation movement should start with the "national liberation movement," and should start with the "whole social movement." It must be understood that the women's problem is only one link in the whole social problem; only when the whole social problem is solved can the women's problem be thoroughly and satisfactorily solved. In other words, true women's liberation is men's liberation, which is also the liberation of "human beings"!</p>

<p>— Ms. Yiling</p>
<p>Trainee in a Middle School</p>
<p>My sister and I used to be trainees at the XX Girls' School on Zhabei XX Road. We originally wanted to be kindergarten teachers at this school and read a bit on our own. As for the title of trainee, we initially found it a bit strange. Schools are not trading firms or stores, so how could there be trainees? Later, the person who introduced us said that most of the kindergarten teachers at this school were promoted from trainees. Anyone who came for the first time had to learn how to manage children in the kindergarten, and only after three months or half a year would they be promoted to teacher.</p>
<p>But after a week of being there, our wishes vanished. We discovered that the exploitation methods here were even more severe than the rationalized system of factories. On the second day of entering the school, the short, bespectacled female principal transferred us to the general affairs office. She said: "I'm sorry, there are too many people in the kindergarten. Please study in the general affairs office for the time being! As soon as there is a vacancy, we will insert you."</p>
<p>We didn't have anything to learn in the general affairs office, just doing record-keeping work all day long. Whenever a student came to get a book or a calligraphy exercise book, we would record it. This work started at eight in the morning and didn't stop until seven in the evening. Before eight in the morning, we had to go to the kitchen to distribute the side dishes to the boarding students. Each student was only allowed one spoonful of fried soybeans or peanuts and a small piece of fermented bean curd (red fermented bean curd costing seven copper coins per piece had to be cut into eight pieces!). In the evening, we also had to manage the students in the dormitory. On Sundays or holidays, we and some of the elementary school teachers were not allowed to go home. We were only allowed to go home twice a month, but we had to return to school before nine in the evening.</p>
<p>Our principal, Ms. Chen XX, is a translator and has translated several English detective novels. She is also a patriot. She cried over her brother, who was studying in Japan, for marrying a Japanese woman, and she angrily scolded him in front of hundreds of elementary school students. And especially an economist, in addition to hiring one or two junior high school teachers with salaries below thirty yuan, the rest of the kindergarten and elementary school teachers were poor widows with salaries of less than twenty yuan and women who were determined not to marry and had no ability to continue their education. Her annual income totaled tens of thousands of yuan, but she still said that there were not enough funds and often went outside to solicit donations.</p>
<p>As for our trainees' salaries, it was only two yuan per month! My sister and I sat in the general affairs office all day long, unable to leave for even a moment. If the principal saw us sitting there doing nothing, she would tell you to copy lecture notes or sew school uniforms. In short, she would find something for you to do. One night, we were reading a book, and she immediately saw it and brought a can of white paint to tell us to paint the glass windows of the bathroom. Miss Li, who went with us, was so angry that she cried, feeling sorry for herself, but I was so angry that I threw the brush into the toilet.</p>
<p>The kindergarten trainees suffered just as much as we did. In name, they could take one hour of child psychology lessons every week, but they didn't have time to review. Because if the principal saw anyone reading, she would say: "This won't do. If you only read your own cruel society</p>
<p>books, no one will do the school's work!"</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, my sister saw that this was not the way to go and left in the first week! But I endured until winter before leaving.</p>

<p>Waitress at an Amusement Park</p>
<p>It wasn't even two o'clock yet, and my mother was habitually saying, "Qiaozhen, why aren't you going to the company yet? If you don't go in a little while, you'll have to listen to the boss's nagging..." "I know... You're forcing me to go every day!" I also seemed to have gotten into the habit of answering my mother with a venomous remark every day, and I ran out of the alley and got on the bus.</p>

<p>— Ms. Pan</p>
<p>(Female Staff Member of a University Registrar's Office)</p>
<p>I am a female staff member of the registrar's office at a certain university. Some people must think that since I work in an educational institution, I interact with people who have received more than ten years of education, and my life must be very satisfactory. Even if I am dissatisfied with my salary and treatment, I shouldn't be in danger of being insulted. However, that is not the case.</p>
<p>Those wealthy university students who specialize in selling their souls, in addition to finding customers in dance halls and female dormitories, also pay attention to me. I am in charge of recording the attendance of university students. Because the school deducts one credit for ten unexcused absences, those who sell their souls often pester me. Sometimes they say that I record too many absences, which causes their credits to be deducted, and they scold me for no reason. In fact, this is not my fault, because it is my job.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they deliberately stand in front of my desk and stare at me. When I ask them what they are doing, they don't answer, but just talk nonsense, beat around the bush, and comment endlessly! These rogue young masters are obviously bored of playing with dance girls recently, and the female students don't pay attention to them, so they do this! Rogue young masters! Let me tell you honestly! I came out to work because I am poor. If I were willing to be a plaything for bourgeois men, would I stay here?</p>
<p>Sometimes, some students from other provinces speak to me in dialects. When I ask them back in English, they don't answer, but just look at me and laugh. It wasn't until later that some female students who understood their language told me that they were asking if I liked them, that I understood. From then on, whenever I heard them ask that question, I would answer in Mandarin like this: "I like you very much! To die for!" They knew that I understood, so they didn't say it anymore!</p>
<p>But I really can't think of a good way to deal with the nonsense of those who sell their souls!</p>
<p>Kept dragging on until the company.</p>
<p>Five o'clock struck, and everyone hurried to change shifts for dinner, to prepare to entertain guests who would eat dinner and go to the game field for tea; otherwise, a swarm of foreign devils would come, and you would be so dizzy from drinking that it would be difficult to cope even if you had eight hands.</p>
<p>The incident started on a Saturday night. On this day, the Beijing opera theater had a new production of "Wen Wu Xiang Qiu", and the audience was particularly crowded. More than a thousand seats were filled with guests, and there were many people standing like standees on both sides of the aisles, and the uniformed supervisors were desperately trying to drive them away. The so-called foreign devils occupied several tables. My table, which usually had few patrons, suddenly had everyone flocking to it as if they had discovered something new. The phrase "difficult to cope even with eight hands" flashed across my mind again, and this situation made me a little anxious.</p>
<p>"Hey! Brew a few cups of tea." A young man, with a rat-like glint in his eyes, said while constantly glancing at my face.</p>
<p>"How many cups, strong, weak?" I asked impatiently.</p>
<p>"Whatever." A man wearing a melon-skin cap and with his sleeves rolled up high replied.</p>
<p>"If it weren't for eating this mixed-up rice, who would be willing to mess around with this bunch of smelly men?" I thought, as I went to get the tea.</p>
<p>"Is six cups enough?" I said, putting the tea in the middle of the table.</p>
<p>"Ah! Not bad! You can hold so many cups in one hand, and still have a towel..." The rat eyes stared even harder, as if he would be happy only if he could swallow me in one gulp.</p>
<p>"What, are they all weak? I want a strong one..." The man with the melon-skin cap quickly interjected.</p>
<p>"I want chrysanthemum tea... Hey! Xiao Wang, ask her to make it. What's the point of drinking hot tea!" The big guy, who hadn't spoken for a long time, now also started to make fun. I retorted, "You said 'whatever,' and I'm not the worm in your stomach. How would I know who likes to drink what?" My eyes were burning with anger, but I still couldn't say anything more venomous to scold them. But I felt that my attitude was enough to make them suffer.</p>

<p>"Yo! What you say sounds very sharp, I didn't see that in you!"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, don't say much, brew a few more cups!" The eyes of the old green rat relaxed.</p>
<p>"What tea?... How many cups?..." I still asked with the same humble but unyielding tone.</p>
<p>"Strong."</p>
<p>"I want chrysanthemum tea."</p>
<p>I took the towel and gathered everything up and left, but my ears were still listening to them: "Hey! Xiao Wang, you're not wronged to treat us tonight, are you?... This 'widow' is much more beautiful than when she first came, look, she's wearing new clothes tonight..."</p>
<p>Ah! No wonder they are doing me a favor tonight and taking care of my business: it turns out it's because of my new clothes. I carried two cups of tea in my hand, thinking as I walked.</p>
<p>"Why did you only brew two cups of tea, and not bring any hot water? I drank all my cups a long time ago." The little melon-skin cap wanted to try something new again.</p>
<p>When I went to brew tea just now, I saw several full cups there, how did they disappear in a blink of an eye? I knew they were trying to make me unable to leave this place, but I was selling tea, so I couldn't stop them from drinking, right? "Take your time, I don't have four hands!" I was always unhappy with their actions.</p>
<p>"Hey! Why are you so beautiful tonight, is your 'night business' good?... How old are you?..." They said to each other first, and when they saw me coming, the rat eyes quickly turned around and sized me up before asking.</p>
<p>"What? Sir, please speak cleanly. This is a place to drink tea, not..." Seeing that they were talking more and more nonsense, I quickly put on a stern face to stop them from continuing.</p>
<p>"It's okay to ask if your tea business at night is good, why put on such a face! I spent money to drink tea, and I still have to put up with your attitude..." The rat eyes flushed red, and he stood up angrily, as if he disdained drinking my tea.</p>
<p>"Go, go, don't drink it; what celestial being can't be found? With money, you don't have to worry about no one carrying you!" The big guy snatched the words.</p>
<p>"How much money? Here's your change!" He threw two dollars on the table, and with a "clang," one rolled down. Of course, I was the one who gave in, and I immediately picked it up for him. They swarmed behind me and followed me to the counter to get the change.</p>
<p>Not good! When I turned back to collect the cups, the five cups were suddenly gone. I asked the other young ladies, and they all said they didn't take them. Needless to say, it wasn't those troublemakers just now, who else could it be? I understood that I didn't know how to cater to them; but I still don't understand how far my profession requires me to cater to customers.</p>

<p>— Little Friend</p>
<p>Bookbinding worker</p>
<p>My sister recently found a job, which is bookbinding work at the XX Bookstore. The salary is six silver dollars a month, without room and board. She understands very well: six dollars a month certainly won't buy enough wine to get drunk, or enough food to get full, or enough to rent a small room, but compared to having no income at all, and facing cold looks from her elderly father all day long, it is much more comfortable. So she gritted her teeth and went to work at the factory.</p>
<p>Alas! Since my sister's husband died and she moved in with my family, her face has been pale, her brows tightly locked, and she has never shown a trace of a smile. She is very casual about what she wears, eats, and drinks. My father, unable to stand it, often scolded her like this: "Burden, debt collector... Money-losing product!"</p>
<p>When she heard this, she didn't say a word, but her brows furrowed even more.</p>
<p>Now she is different. When she gets up in the morning, she combs her hair very smoothly, hides her greasy cloth shirt, and seems to have a happy look on her face, because she hears that after three months, she will be able to live independently.</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>"Everyone listen up! The company sent out a notice this morning, saying: "The Japanese have seized Rehe! During this time of national crisis, we will implement 'Aviation to Save the Nation.' Everyone must pay an 'Aviation Donation' of two yuan within half a month." A foreman-like figure held up a piece of paper and said to the female workers.</p>
<p>"We don't acknowledge it! We don't acknowledge it! We can't donate that much! We only have eight silver dollars a month in total, how are we supposed to live?" Forty or fifty female workers shouted in a chaotic chorus.</p>
<p>"Whether you acknowledge it or not, this is the boss's order."</p>
<p>"Is there any reason for this?... Mr. Wang!"</p>
<p>"This, this, this is not..."</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>Half a month has passed, and the female workers' wages have all been paid. Everyone is silent. Only the sound of their whispers can be heard on the road...</p>
<p>"Damn it! Save the nation? Save the nation? Save it into the arms of the foreign devils! Save it into his mother's pocket! Is this how you save the nation?"</p>
<p>My sister returned home, threw the one silver dollar she received on the table, and sighed: "This is half a month's wages!" Looking at her face, it was as pale as it was half a month ago!</p>

<p>— Ms. Zhu Yongli</p>
<p>Child Laborer</p>
<p>I am a fourteen-year-old girl. I came from the countryside a few months ago and encountered the war in Shanghai. At that time, my family lived in Jiangwan. We fled in the countryside for a few months, and finally fled to Shanghai. My father also had nothing to do, and the whole family was just waiting to starve. It happened that we met a woman from our hometown who worked in the Hengfeng Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road, and my father asked her to take me in. I learned for a month, learned it, and could handle ninety heads (equivalent to half of an adult worker), but there was no pay, it was said to be savings. I worked for another month, still with no pay. It wasn't until the third month that I received one dollar, but the snack money every day was one hundred wen, which was three thousand wen a month. In terms of the foreign exchange rate at that time, one dollar wasn't even enough. If I did something wrong in the factory, I would be scolded and whipped. I didn't want to go, but at home I would be beaten by my father. Of course, my father couldn't bear to beat his daughter, but he did it for the sake of the family's livelihood! I got up at five in the morning every day and left work at six in the evening. By the time I got home, it was already seven o'clock, because the place I lived was far from the factory. At first, I didn't know the way, and my father had to pick me up and drop me off every day. My mother got up in the middle of the night to cook for me, because the weather was very hot at that time, and the overnight rice often fermented and couldn't be eaten the next day. Therefore, the whole family was very busy for me to work. I worked for four months and still only received one dollar. At this time, my body was getting weaker and weaker, and I couldn't remember many of the books I had read before, so I asked my father not to work anymore. My father had no choice but to say with a bitter face: "Okay, let's not do it!" I stayed at home for a few days and ran to the factory to get my savings. I said to a fat man: "I'm going back to the countryside, please calculate my savings for me." Who knew he sneered and said: "You can't get savings after working for a few months." Alas! I ran home with my head drooping like this. But when I think back to these four months of life, it was simply worse than being a cow or a horse, especially working the night shift. You can't be lazy for a moment, and even going to the toilet has a set time. If you fall asleep in the toilet because you are too tired, and Wen runs over and sees you, he will either beat you or scold you for being a pig. I used to think that the peasants in the countryside were the most miserable, but now when I see the workers in the city, they are a hundred times more miserable than the peasants! I have now left that hell, but the sisters who used to work with me, who are about the same age as me, are still dragging their thin and yellow bodies in and out of that hell every day.</p>
<p>Now, I am unemployed, but I still want to find some better things to do to help my father. I have a high school diploma. I am willing to do any kind of work as a female trainee in companies, businesses, and other institutions. As for the salary, it doesn't matter how much or how little; I think the gentlemen who read this magazine will not bully this poor girl. Please forward the correspondence address through this magazine.</p>
